Introduction\nUltrasonic motors [1] have many advantages forapplications in microelectromechanical systems\n(MEMS). In contrast with electromagnetic motors, their\nsimple construction makes them well suited for miniatur-\nization, and their overall efficiency is relatively insensitive\nto size.\nThe study reported here focuses on a standing wave-\ntype motor of very simple design that combines the con-\ntour mode vibrations of a piezoelectric ceramic plate with\na metallic flextensional amplifier\/mode converter to turn\nthe contour vibrations into vertical motion perpendicular\nto the plane of the plate. The beryllium copper rotor uses\nthe elastic fin principle of operation that was described in\n[2] and is illustrated in Fig. 1. Elastic fins connected to a\nrotor are pushed into contact with a vibrating surface. As\nthe vibrating element moves upward (I \u2192 II \u2192 III) (along\nthe z-axis), the tip of each fin is held in contact with its\nsurface by static friction. The fins act as rigid levers, and\nthe rotor is propelled about its axis of rotation by the hori-\nzontal component of the reactive force. When the vibrating\nelement moves downward (IV \u2192 V \u2192 VI), the tips of the\nfins slip across its surface and so the cycle progresses back\nto I.\nManuscript received March 22, 2003; accepted March 11, 2004.

Schematic of the flextensional motor construction.\nA beryllium copper flextensional amplifier or cymbal [3],\n[4] converts the contour vibrations (x-y plane) of a square\npiezoelectric plate into vertical flexural oscillations along\nthe direction normal to its plane (z-axis). The elastic fin\ncoupling elements are pressed into contact with the upper\nsurface of the cymbal, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe cymbal operates both as a mode conversion ele-\nment and displacement amplifier. In this way the rela-\ntively high force generated by the piezoelectric transducer\n(PZT) element can be better matched for motor use. Pre-\nvious work [5]\u2013[7] has demonstrated a motor of this type\nusing a double cymbal arrangement with a circular disc\nPZT driver. The motor design described here is simpler\nbecause the structure is single sided and better matched\n0885\u20133010\/$20.00 c\u00a9 2004 IEEE\n930 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 8, august 2004\nTABLE I\nPractical Design Parameters for Rotors and Stator.\n\u03b8 rr (min, max) tr , 1 Wr\nRotor [\u25e6] [mm] [mm] [g]\nR1 15 4.9, 5.9 0.5, 1.5 1.9\nR2 15 4.3, 5.8 0.25, 3.5 1.4\nR3 45 4.6, 5.6 0.5, 1.5 1.9\nR4 45 4.2, 5.6 0.25, 3.5 1.4\nR5 60 4.5, 5.6 0.5, 1.5 1.9\nR6 60 4.1, 5.9 0.25, 3.5 1.4\nR7 15 3.7, 5.3 0.25, 3.5 1.4\nls, ws, ts tc \u03b1 C Ws Wc\nStator [mm] [mm] [\u25e6] [nF] [g] [g]\n25.3 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 2.1 0.45 37.5 2.8 11.7 1.8\nto MEMS manufacturing processes, for which the motor\ndesigned here was a scaled-up prototype. Especially the\nsquare plate as a vibrating element is expected to give ad-\nvantages in matrix-based MEMS processes because dicing\nout of the devices could be made by standard semiconduc-\ntor saw. The motor is attached at the plate\u2019s center point\nto allow free contour movement of the PZT driver. A spring\nload (bias force) is applied to press the fins into contact\nwith the cymbal, and some lateral movement is allowed at\nthe shaft to ensure even contact. The motor operates on a\nsingle-phase electrical supply. This gives some advantages\nof simplicity when compared with the complicated multi-\nphase drives frequently used with travelling-wave motors.\nThe motor is unidirectional. Two-way operation could per-\nhaps be achieved by a double-fin configuration in which\ntwo sets of fins with inverted angles are located at the\ndifferent radii [6].\nII. Design\nIn operation, the vertical displacement of the cymbal\nsurface is in direct relation to the radial displacement of\nthe cymbal\u2019s contact ring. The parameters relevant to the\nmotor design are defined in Fig. 2 and Table I. In this\ndesign, \u03b8 is the angle of the fin and rr is the rotor\/stator\ncontact radius; l and tr are length and thickness of the\nfin, respectively. Wr is weight of the rotor, including ball\nbearing (0.94 g); ls, ws, and ts are the length, width, and\nthickness of the PZT element; \u03b1 and tc are the cymbal\u2019s\nwall angle and thickness, respectively. Ws and Wc are the\nweight of the stator and the cymbal; C is the low frequency\ncapacitance (1 kHz) of the PZT plate.\nUchiki et al. [2] presented a simplified solution for the\nfin\u2019s lateral movement (x) as a function of vibrator\u2019s ver-\ntical displacement (z).\nx(z) =\n1\ntan \u03b8\nz. (1)\nThe angular velocity \u03c9r [rad\/s] of the rotor can be pre-\nsented by the fin displacement (x), fin-stator contact ra-\ndius (rr), and driving frequency (f) with the following\nformula:\n\u03c9r =\nx(z)\nrr\nf. (2)\nThe torque of the motor can be represented as:\nTm = F\u00b5rr = \u00b5Farr , (3)\nwhere F\u00b5 is a tangential component of the frictional force,\nFa is the axial force on the rotor, and \u00b5 is the static coef-\nficient of friction.\nThe efficiency of the device can be evaluated as the ratio\nof the electrical power input to mechanical power output:\n\u00b5 =\nPout\nPin\n=\nTm\u03c9r\nUinIin cos(\u03d5)\n, (4)\nwhere Uin and Iin are rms voltage and current supplied\nto motor. Cos(\u03d5) is the power factor where \u03d5 is phase\ndifference between the voltage and current signals. The\ninput current can be calculated from the supply voltage\nand the impedance characteristics (Iin = Uin\/Z).\nIn order to understand which frequencies transmit the\nelectrical energy to mechanical vibration, it is important\nto analyze the frequency spectrum of the device. The ratio\nof energy stored in mechanical form (electrical energy con-\nverted to mechanical energy) to the total energy provided\nby the source (electrical energy) is represented by the elec-\ntromechanical coupling coefficient (keff), which can be cal-\nculated using the well-known relation between resonance\n(fm) and antiresonance (fn) frequencies [8]:\nk2eff =\nf2n \u2212 f2m\nf2n\n. (5)\nThe sharpness of the resonance is described by the Q-\nfactor. The smaller the internal losses are in the piezoelec-\ntric element\/device the higher the Q-factor. This means\nboth a more efficient electromechanical interface and a nar-\nrower operational bandwidth. It is known that Q-factor of\nthe piezoelectric devices can be evaluated from impedance\ncharacteristics [9]:\nQm =\nfr\nf2 \u2212 f1 , (6)\nwhere fr is a resonance frequency. The f1 and f2 are fre-\nquencies 3 dB off the amplitude of the resonance frequency\n(fr). The mechanical loss factor can be calculated from the\nQ-factor (\u03b6 = 1\/Qm) [10].\nIII. Finite Element Modeling\nFinite element harmonic and modal analyses of the\ncymbal, PZT plate, and stator were performed using AN-\nSYS 5.7.1\u0001 (ANSYS, Inc., Canonsburg, PA) to estab-\nlish which vibration modes were active at any opera-\ntional frequency and their operational characteristics. Ab-\nsolute displacements and blocking forces were evaluated\nleinvuo et al.: analysis of new type of ultrasonic motor 931\nFig. 3. Modeled resonance mode (Z displacement) for stator\n(79.7 kHz). By way of explanation, in this mode, the rim of the\nhole at 1 is moving in the opposite direction to the locus of points at\nrr 2), where the rotor legs contact the cymbal. At this time in the\nmotion, the corners, C, of the ceramic plate tend to move down.\nusing harmonic analysis. Modeling was conducted in three-\ndimensional (3-D) as it is not possible to model a square\nplate using radial symmetry, as was done in previous mod-\neling work of cymbals [3].\nThe chosen step size in the analysis was 1 kHz, which\ngave a reasonable compromise for accuracy versus com-\nputational time. The effects of the bonding layer between\nthe cymbal and PZT plate were neglected. As mechani-\ncal boundary conditions, the center of the PZT plate was\nfixed in the area located in its center point with a radius\nof 3 mm, which was equivalent to the device mount in\na test part (Fig. 2). The electric field was applied onto\nthe top face of the PZT plate (i.e., cymbal side) and the\nbottom face was grounded. Orientation of the poling was\nin the thickness direction. The cymbal was defined as be-\ning made from an isotropic metallic material without any\nelectrical resistance. The modeled total mass of the stator\n(11.6 g) compares very well with the measured mass of\nthe test part presented in Table I, which verifies the ge-\nometry and material densities. The detailed material data\nfor the PZT used (PC4, Morgan ElectroceramicTM) was\ntaken from the manufacturer\u2019s datasheet [9] and from the\nPZT-4 data in [11].\nHarmonic analysis of the plate and stator were carried\nout to locate the electrical resonances of the structure.\nModal analysis was used to visualize mode shapes. Both\nwere compared with the experimental data, as will be de-\nscribed below. Harmonic analysis demonstrated that the\nPZT plate described in Table I has a very clear resonant\npeak at 77.0 kHz with a weaker one at 112.0 kHz. The sta-\ntor has several piezoelectrically active resonant frequencies\nin the range 50\u2013120 kHz. The strongest resonance of these\nwas detected at 80.0 kHz. The detailed results of these\nanalyses are discussed below and compared with experi-\nment.\nA modal analysis was carried out close to the resonant\nfrequencies in order to establish an understanding of the\nrelevant mechanical motion. Fig. 3 represents the mode\nshape 79.7 kHz. The mode shape at 61.5 kHz is quite sim-\nilar to this. The former is close to the plate\u2019s contour res-\nonance frequency (77 kHz), in which all the sides of the\nPZT plate are moving laterally in and out in the same\nphase.\nA modal analysis also was carried out on the cymbal\nalone to compare its mechanical resonances with those ob-\nserved in the electrical resonance of the complete stator.\nThe radial symmetric resonance frequencies found for the\ncymbal were 53.4 and 78.3 kHz. Both of the mode shapes\nare virtually the same as in the modeled stator structure.\nHarmonic analysis was used to get absolute values\nof displacement and blocking force at the rotor\/stator\ncontact-point (rr) (Fig. 2). The absolute values of ver-\ntical displacements were evaluated in four different mea-\nsurement points (Fig. 3). The blocking force was evaluated\nby fixing measurement point 2 along the z-axis, which is\nequivalent to radius of contact point (rr). Table II presents\nthe results achieved at two resonant frequencies when volt-\nage Vp0 = 60 V was applied to the PZT plate. The me-\nchanical damping factor (\u03b6) in the model was evaluated\nfrom the measured impedance characteristics (6).\nThe calculated displacements show how strongly the\ndifferent points are deflected relative to each other. Dis-\nplacement amplification (Z2\/X4) for 61 and 80 kHz are 37\nand 4, respectively. One can notice that the resonance fre-\nquency is shifted a bit higher when obtaining the blocking\nforce. This is due to the change in the mechanical bound-\nary conditions, which were applied to the measurement\npoint 2 (Fig. 3). When considering the current (I), it can be\nseen that it is much higher at the PZT plate\u2019s fundamental\nfrequency, as would be expected. This leads to the maxi-\nmum power input requirement. At the same time, the elec-\ntromechanical coupling is greatest based on the achieved\nkeff values (keff(61 kHz) = 0.18, keff(80 kHz) = 0.27)\n(5). The analogy suggests that the stator should be\ndriven at its fundamental resonance in order to provide\nmaximum power output. However, because of the dif-\nferent mechanical damping factors (\u03b6(61 kHz) = 0.0063,\n\u03b6(80 kHz) = 0.0085), the displacements and reactive forces\nremain very close to each other (Table II).\nA simple 2-D modal analysis was used to determine the\nresonance frequencies for the fins used in the experiments\n(Table I). Analytical calculations [12] suggest that a fin\nwith thickness tr = 0.5 mm and length l = 1.5 mm has its\nfirst resonance frequency at about 143 kHz. However, a fin\nwith dimensions of tr = 0.25 mm and l = 3.5 mm has its\nfirst resonance frequency at about 13 kHz. The latter fin\nwas modeled in finite element modeling (FEM) as a 2-D\nbeam model with one end fixed. The modeling gave the\nfirst and second resonance frequencies, 12 and 81 kHz. It\ncan be seen that the latter is very close to the stator\u2019s res-\nonance frequency (80 kHz). This may cause a phase shift\nbetween the stator and fin movements and could mean\nthat the fin is hitting the stator surface before or after\nit has finished its displacement cycle. This could generate\nincreased wear at the point of contact and low-frequency\ncomponents of vibration, which could be detected as an\naudible noise.\n932 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 8, august 2004\nTABLE II\nCalculated Displacements, Blocking Forces, and Currents at the Stator\u2019s Resonance Frequencies.\nDisplacement measurements Force measurements\nFreq Z1 Z12 Z3 Z4 X4 I Freq F\n1 I\n[kHz] [\u00b5m] [\u00b5m] [\u00b5m] [\u00b5m] [\u00b5m] [mA] [kHz] [N] [mA]\n61 5.1 \u22122.2 \u22121.1 0.9 0.06 7.5 62 5.8 117\n80 2.0 \u22121 0.5 \u22120.08 \u22120.25 450 81 5.8 300\n1Z2 and F are z-displacement and blocking force at rr , respectively.\nFig. 4. Practical flextensional motor with stator, rotor, and electrical\nconnections.\nIV. Motor Construction\nThe top view of a complete motor with the stator and\nrotor is presented in Fig. 4. An active element for the stator\n(PZT plate) was cut to the desired dimensions. The ampli-\nfier element was made from 0.45-mm thick beryllium cop-\nper foil (Cu98\/Be2) using a pressing tool. These two parts\nthen were bonded together with electrically conductive\nepoxy (CircuitWorks\u0001 CW2400, Chemtronics, Kennesaw,\nGA) in order to provide electrical connection between the\ncymbal and PZT. The parts were held together at a tem-\nperature of 40\u25e6C for several hours, then cooled down be-\nfore testing. In addition, electric wires were bonded to the\ncymbal and PZT with the same conductive epoxy. The top\nsurface of the device mount was bonded with the Loctite\u0001\n402 cyanoacrylate adhesive (Henkel Consumer Adhesives,\nInc., Avon, OH) to the center of the plate (Fig. 2). The\nlower surface of the device mount was connected to the\nexternal test jig.\nAll of the rotors were wet-chemically etched from the\nsame material as the amplifier. The outside diameter of\nthe rotor is 20 mm, including the encoder features in its\nouter radius. The ball bearing was bonded with Loctite\u0001\n402 along the rotor\u2019s center axis using a centering tool.\nFins were bent to the desired angle under a video mi-\ncroscope using a bending tool with a resolution of \u00b11\u25e6.\nMechanical dimensions were measured using a precision\nmicrometer and weights with a Sartorius 1474 (Sartorius\nAG, Goettingen, Germany) micro-balance. Low-frequency\ncapacitance (C @ 1 kHz) was measured using a GR1689M\nRLC DigiBridge (IET Labs, Inc., Westbury, NY).\nV. Stator Characterization\nThe impedance characteristics of the PZT (PC4) plate\nalone and a complete stator were evaluated up to 120 kHz\nat an alternating current (AC) electric field of 1 Vrms,\nwith step size of 0.5 kHz using a HP4192A (Agilent Tech-\nnologies, Palo Alto, CA) impedance analyzer connected to\na computer via GPIB interface. The PZT plate was con-\nnected between spring-loaded leads at its center point. The\nstator was measured in a test jig in which the stator\u2019s edge\nwas installed between two spring-loaded leads.\nIn addition to the electrical measurements, the mechani-\ncal displacement of the stator was evaluated directly using\na Polytec dual-beam differential laser Doppler vibrome-\nter (Polytec OFV 3001, Polytec GmbH, Waldbronn, Ger-\nmany) [13]. The stator was mounted in a precision micro-\nstage, which allowed scanning of sample points along one\naxis across the stator at millimeter intervals. A digital sig-\nnal processing lock-in amplifier was used as a signal source\nfor a power amplifier (Krohn-Hite 7500, Krohn-Hite Corp.,\nBrockton, MA). The electric current was monitored by\na noncontact current probe (Tektronix 6021, Tektronix,\nBeaverton, OR) and temperature inside the cymbal by a\nthermocouple.\nVI. Motor Characterization\nIn mechanical characterization, several rotors (Table I)\nwith different fin lengths and inclinations were tested in\norder to investigate the influence that these parameters\nhave on motor performance. Motor performance data were\ncollected using a mechanical test jig designed to allow con-\ntinuous measurement of the output torque and speed. The\ntorque was monitored using a pulley-brake method and\nspeed by integrated rotary encoder. Detailed description\nof the measurement setup can be found in [14]. The pulley-\nbrake principle has been demonstrated in the micro new-\nton meter range with resolution of 1 \u00b5Nm and relative\nerror of about 7.5% [15].\nVII. Results and Discussion\nA. Stator\nThe measured impedance characteristics from 50 to\n120 kHz for the PZT (PC4) plate and complete stator\nleinvuo et al.: analysis of new type of ultrasonic motor 933\nFig. 5. Modeled and measured impedance characteristics of PZT\nplate (PC4).\nFig. 6. Modeled and measured impedance characteristics of the com-\nplete stator structure (cymbal+PZT plate).\nare presented in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Comparison\nwith the calculated impedance characteristics shows good\nagreement between the modeled and measured resonance\ncharacteristics. The interaction between the natural reso-\nnance frequency of PZT plate and cymbal gives split res-\nonant impedance characteristics in the region of 80 kHz,\nwhich was predicted by FEM analysis and can be seen\nclearly from the graph (Fig. 6).\nWhen comparing the results of harmonic analyses of the\nPZT plate (Fig. 5) and stator (Fig. 6), it is interesting to\nnote the generation of a new resonant peak in the region of\n60 kHz, which is not visible in the PZT plate alone. An up-\nshift of the modeled 53.4 kHz radial symmetric resonance\nof the cymbal to 61 kHz is the most likely explanation for\nFig. 7. Optically measured displacement values, 1 and 2, and modeled\nmode shape, 3.\nthis, caused by the increase in cymbal stiffness due to the\nclamping of the ring as it is bonded to the piezoelectric\nplate. The shift in frequency cannot be seen at the higher\nfrequency so strongly, because the natural frequency of the\ncymbal and stator are approximately the same. Instead of\na frequency shift, the matching of the two natural frequen-\ncies can be detected from the ripple to the left of the mode\nat 80 kHz (Fig. 6).\nThe optically measured stator displacement is presented\nin Fig. 7. The first line, 1, indicates the vibration shape af-\nter the stator reached a constant temperature. The stator\nwas heated up to stable conditions (\u223c109\u25e6C) with a sup-\nply voltage of 100 Vpp. There the achieved phase measure-\nments were stable and allowed definition of mode shape,\nwhich matched the modeled shape. Current Iin was mea-\nsured as approximately of 420 mArms. The second line,\n2, illustrates vibration profile at antiresonance frequency\n(82.5 kHz) and in stabilized temperature conditions that\nindicated a similar mode shape as was measured at the\nresonance frequency (line 1) but with smaller displacement\nvalues. In this case, the temperature stabilized to \u223c45\u25e6C,\nand the measured current was approximately 14 mArms.\nThe third line, 3, indicates the modeled vibration mode\nshape in resonance frequency. Modeled data points are\nbased on the result of harmonic analysis described be-\nfore (Table II). The relatively big differences between the\nmodeled and measured displacements could be explained\nby the reduction of piezoelectric coefficient d31 due to the\nheating up of the PZT element. The losses due to heat\nwere neglected in the FEM model.\nB. Motor\nFig. 8 shows the measured no-load speed characteris-\ntics of the flextensional motor as a function of leg inclina-\ntion (Table I). In comparison, the calculated speed (2) us-\ning FEM (Table II) and interferometer measurement data\n(Fig. 7) are presented in parallel with the measurements.\nThe practical device experiences a temperature rise due\n934 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 8, august 2004\nFig. 8. Measured maximum no load speed as a function of leg in-\nclination [rotors R2 (Freq = 59.6 kHz, Fa = 1100 mN, \u03b8 = 15\u25e6),\nR4(Freq = 69.4 kHz, Fa = 437 mN, \u03b8 = 45\u25e6), R6(Freq = 67 kHz,\nFa = 213 mN, \u03b8 = 60\u25e6)]. As a reference, the calculated max-\nimum speeds based on FEM analysis at a frequency of 80 kHz\n(zpeak-peak = 2 \u00b5m) and interferometer measurement at a frequency\nof 80 kHz (zpeak-peak = 1.2 \u00b5m).\nFig. 9. Stall torque as a function of axial force (R1(tr = 0.5 mm and\nl = 1.5 mm), R7(tr = 0.25 mm and l = 3.5 mm)).\nto the internal losses of the stator structure. In practical\nspeed measurements, the motor was run for only 10 s, and\nin the interferometer measurement the stator was excited\nfor as long as 5 minutes before obtaining the results. The\nmodel suggests that the rotational speed should increase as\nthe angle of inclination \u03b8 decreases. This is clearly shown\nin Fig. 8. It can be seen that the measured speed is located\nbetween two calculated speeds with the fin angle of 15\u25e6.\nWith the angles 45\u25e6 and 60\u25e6, (1) is underestimating the\nachieved rotational speed. This shows that the angle of the\nfin is not that dominant parameter as the model assumes.\nThe model also suggests that, when frequency increases,\nthe speed should increase (2). However, Fig. 8 shows that\nthe inclination of the fin has a more dominant influence on\nthe speed characteristics.\nFig. 9 presents the stall torque characteristics of the\nmotor. These results indicate that the stall torque is pro-\nportional to the applied axial force, which is in agreement\nwith the model (3). The highest stall torque 0.72 Nmm\n(14 N\u00b5m\/Vrms) was achieved with rotor R7 at 79.6 kHz,\nFig. 10. Mechanical power output and efficiency as a function of\naxial force (R1(tr = 0.5 mm and l = 1.5 mm), R7(tr = 0.25 mm and\nl = 3.5 mm)).\nwhich is close to the cymbal and plate natural frequen-\ncies. This compares with thickness mode elastic fin motor\npresented by Uchiki et al. [2], which achieved a maximum\ntorque of 178 N\u00b5m\/Vrms but with much bigger PZT disc\ndimensions (\u0003 = 30 mm, t = 14 mm). The Uchiki\u2019s mo-\ntor generates 18 Nnm\/Vrms\/mm3, and the flextensional\nmotor generates 14 Nnm\/Vrms\/mm3, indicating that the\nsmaller volume of PZT used in the flextensional structure\nlargely accounts for the difference in performance. The\ndrivable axial force values are approximately 20\u201325% of\nthe modeled values, and this is an indication of energy\nlosses such as heating. An increase in the frictional force\nwill increase the stall torque, and this requires a higher\nmechanical force from the stator structure. This could be\nachieved by reducing the PZT thickness for a given, ap-\nplied voltage. Another way to increase the torque is to\nincrease the radius of the contact point (rr).\nThe mechanical power output and efficiency are pre-\nsented in Fig. 10. The power output of 6.41 mW was\nachieved with the elastic rotor configuration (tr = 0.25 mm\nand l = 3.5 mm) and at 79.6 kHz with an axial force of\nFa = 1430 mN. When driving the motor at 64 kHz with\nthe stiff rotor configuration (tr = 0.5 mm and l = 1.5 mm),\nthe maximum power output of 9.36 mW was achieved with\naxial force of Fa = 540 mN. This shows that the electrical\nenergy at lower frequencies is translated more efficiently\ninto the mechanical rotational energy. The loss of energy\nat high frequency might be explained by the structure\u2019s re-\nduced mechanical response, which could be due to the in-\nertia of leg bending. In addition, the second resonance fre-\nquency (81 kHz) of the elastic fin (rotor R7, tr = 0.25 mm\nand l = 3.5 mm) was very close to the driving frequency\n(79.6 kHz), which may have resulted in loss of the power\noutput. To be able to respond to the high-frequency dis-\nplacements, the moving structure should be light and rigid.\nThis suggests that the leg structure should be made either\nfrom a properly oriented composite network or some hol-\nlow construction providing lightweight and high stiffness\nin the bending direction.\nleinvuo et al.: analysis of new type of ultrasonic motor 935\nThe efficiency of the motor was calculated as the ra-\ntio of the maximum mechanical output power and electri-\ncal input power (4). The highest efficiency was achieved\nat 64 kHz with a stiff rotor structure (tr = 0.5 mm and\nl = 1.5 mm). This combination had a maximum efficiency\nof 1.18% with Fa = 540 mN, Pin = 796 mW (\u03d5 = 69\u25e6,\nIin = 51 mArms, Uin = 49 Vrms) and Pout = 9.36 mW.\nThe power input definition includes a compensation of\nelectrical losses generated by the measuring electronics\n(\u223c100 mW). The achieved efficiency compares very well\nwith other elastic fin designs and is in the upper range\n(<1% [16], <1.7%[7], 0.6% [2], 0.17% [17]). It should be\nnoted that the electric current in the driven frequency\n(79.6 kHz) was very low (\u223c65 mArms) compared to the\nvalue determined in conjugation with vibrometer displace-\nment measurements (420 mArms). This indicates that the\nmotor was driven slightly out of resonance (between reso-\nnance and antiresonance).\nThe results suggest that the motor should be driven\nat a lower resonance mode rather than fundamental reso-\nnance of PZT plate. When driving the motor at the lower\nfrequency (64 kHz), the efficiency was higher compared\nto the high-frequency drive because of the higher electri-\ncal current intake at 79.6 kHz. Another reason might have\nbeen the rotor\u2019s reduced mechanical response with rotor\nR7, which was used in higher-frequency drive. Important\nfactors that have been omitted and may significantly in-\nfluence behavior are: sliding of the fin on the upstroke,\nwhich could cause significant loss of efficiency in this mo-\ntor structure; a drift from resonance in the stator or a shift\nto a different resonant mode due to heating. The results\nfrom displacement measurements gave valuable informa-\ntion by confirming the modeled mode shape. Also it was\nimportant to notice in which temperature the stator sta-\nbilizes and its effect on phase measurements. From the\npoint of view of efficiency, running the motor in antireso-\nnance would be ideal because of lower power consumption.\nProbably, the most efficient running is found between the\nresonance and antiresonance frequencies. However, opti-\nmization of the running frequency would be a topic for\nfurther studies.\nVIII. Conclusions\nThis paper has presented the design, fabrication, and\ncharacterization of a new type of standing wave piezoelec-\ntric ultrasonic motor. The motor uses a metallic cymbal\nto convert and amplify the contour mode vibrations of a\nsquare piezoelectric ceramic plate into flexural oscillations,\nwhich are further converted to produce rotary actuation\nby means of an elastic-fin friction. Displacement amplifi-\ncation is important in MEMS structures because the ratio\nbetween surface finish and device size is increased, which\nleads to higher frictional forces\/losses in sliding medias.\nBy amplifying the displacement of the PZT vibrator, the\nspeed of the rotor can be increased. However, when the\ndisplacement is amplified, the generated force is decreased,\nwhich also decreases the achieved maximum torque com-\npared to similar size of device run in thickness mode. In\naddition, the motor can be driven at a lower frequency\nthan the same ceramic actuated in thickness mode, which\nmakes fin design easier.\nIn particular, finite element analysis has been used ef-\nfectively to demonstrate and characterize the vibrational\nmodes of operation. The predicted mode shape was com-\npared experimentally using a laser Doppler vibrometer. It\nwas found that FEM calculations overestimated displace-\nments of the cymbal because heating up of the PZT was\nneglected in the model. Some areas have been highlighted\nthat should enable motor efficiency, torque, and speed to\nbe improved. The best stall torque and no load speed for\na 25-mm square motor were 0.72 Nmm and 895 r\/minute,\nrespectively.\nFuture work will include analysis of a disc type flexten-\nsional motor and comparison in its operation to the square\nplate stator. In order to improve efficiency, it is important\nto develop system level models, including all key compo-\nnents such as stator, rotor, and spring with contact me-\nchanics. Also very important is to update the FEM model\nto be able to take account heating of the PZT element as\na function of excitation time and power input. Analyzing\nthe motor as a system, and considering the heating-up ef-\nfect, would explain which part of the motor loses the most\nof the energy and how it should be possible to increase\nefficiency.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. Tony Gee for his guid-\nance and advice in performing the mechanical characteri-\nzation, and Joe Southin for his expertise in finite element\nmodeling.
