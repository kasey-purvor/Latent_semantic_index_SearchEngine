INTRODUCTION \nInterconnects in deep sub-micron technologies are typi- \ncally very lossy so that the RC delay dominates. In order \nto keep the resistance to a minimum the aspect ratio \n(widthiheight) of wires are kept low, which however gives \nrise to increased inter-wire capacitance. This inter-wire \ncapacitance results in cross-talk which has an effect on the \ndelay, depending on how the aggressor lines switch. \nCross-talk is of especial significance in uniformly coupled \nparallel wires, causing unpredictable delays[l]. Recently \nthere has been a profusion of research into block oriented \narchitectures[2] which are being proposed as being suita- \nble to overcome the interconnect bottleneck and to cope \nwith complexity. The intra-block communication link in \nall of these will consist of a large number. of parallel \nwires, with uniform coupling over most of the wire length \nin all probability. The question we pose and attempt to \nanswer in this paper is, given a fixed area in which to dis- \ntribute the interconnect, what is the best configuration of \nthe wires to obtain the highest bandwidth? Is it to have a \nfew fat wires and a high signaling frequency, or a large \nnumber of small wires with a lower signaling frequency, \nor anything in between? How does the wire spacing affect \noverall bandwidth? What effect does repeater insertion \nhave? \nIn such an analysis, it is essential that the wire capaci- \ntance is distributed over a ground component and cou- \npling component, and the effect of cross-talk an delay is \ntaken into account. Our electrical model for investigating \ndelay is shown in Fig. 1. Each line, except the two periph- \neral lines are coupled on both sides to aggressors. The \nexact effect of cross-talk on delay depends on the switch- \ning alignment of the aggressors with respect to the victim. \nIn [l] and [3] we give an analysis of delay in such uni- \nformly coupled lines with different switching pattems. \nSince in general, it is necessary to design for the worst- \n4 \nW, t \nFigure 2.

It is \nequally important to have accurate closed form equations \nfor the capacitance terms shown in the figure. We use the \nexpressions given in [4] which are empirical equations \nexhibiting good accuracy. \nThe rest of this document is structured in this manner. In \nsection 2 we consider the intrinsic delay of the line, and \nderive expressions for the optimal bandwidth. In section 3 \nwe include the effects of the non-ideal drivers and con- \nsider repeater insertion. Finally we give our conclusions. \n2. LINE DELAY \nAll lines are uniformly coupled to two aggressor lines, \nexcept the two comer-most lines which are coupled to one \naggressor. It has been shown that the dominant time con- \nstant approximation for the worst-case 50% delay for such \nlines is accurate to over 95% [3]. Eq. ( I )  gives the delay \nfor the middle conductors while ( 2 )  gives the delay for the \ncomer conductors' where the resistance and capacitances \nrefer to the total values for the lines (see Fig. I ) .  \nT0,5,mid = 0.4RC,+ ISIRC, ( 1 )  \nTo,, corn = 0.4RCS + 0.75RCc (2) \nThe delay is matched to the bit period hy apportioning \nsome percentage of the period to the rise and fall times so \nthat a sufficient margin is allowed (Fig. 2) .  Usually 3 \ndelays are considered to be sufficient for the response to \npass the 90% threshold. We chose to be more conservative \nand use 4. Hence the bit period is given by (3) and (4) \n' , , m i d  = 4T0.S,mid (3) \nTp.corn -  TO.^.

The expressions for the \nfringing and mutual capacitances (where is the permit- \ntivity and pan empirical constant for the technology) were \noriginally presented in [4]. These are accurate to over 90% \nwhen the following inequalities are satisfied. \n0.3 < ( w \/ h )  < 30, 0.3 < ( U h )  < I O ,  \nFor DSM, typical geometries are well within this range.

REPEATER INSERTION \nThe above analysis considered only the intrinsic delay \nof the lines. In practice the source will be a MOS driver \n(usually an inverter) with a considerable output imped- \nance. Also to reduce delay the long lines in Fig. 1 are bro- \nken up into shorter sections, with a repeater driving each \nsection. The analysis for repeater insertion is carried out \nby characterizing the non-linear buffers (inverters) by an . . . .  \noutput resistance R ,  and input capacitance C, If the \nnumber of repeaters including the original driver is k, and \nthe size of each repeater is h times a minimum sued \ninverter (all lines are buffered in a similar fashion), the \noutput impedance of an h sized driver becomes R&,,P, \nand the output capacitance h*Cdm, where R,, and C-,m \nare the output resistance and input capacitance of a mini- \nmum sized inverter respectively in that particular technol- \nogy. This configuration is sketched out in Fig. 4, where the \nsymbol E refers to a capacitively coupled interconnect \nas shown in Fig. 1. A complete analysis is given in [I] and \nthe total delay is as defined by (14) where r, refers to the \nrise time of the signal (it is assumed the rise times are typ- \nically much less than the delay of the line). Additionally \nthe optimum k and h for minimising delay are defined by \n(1 5) and (16). \n-*-.* \n~i~~~~ 5: variation ofBandwidth with @timal ~ ~ f f ~ , i , , ~  \n. .  \n7 G W S s  . i . . . . ;  , ' . . . .  . . . ~ . .  . . \n. . . . . . . \n. . .% .. . . . .. . . . . . \n1 1 6 .  \n1': \n-.sm \n-*-* \nFigure 6: Variation of Bandwidth with a Fixed Number \nand Size of Buffers for Each Line \nof the repeaters can be calculated. It must be mentioned \nhere that it is possible to pipeline the bits with a bit per \nsection. In fact it is possible to obtain a gain in the band- \nwidth by introducing repeaters to pipeline bits, even when \nthere is no significant improvement in the overall line \ndelay. We choose to ignore pipelining in this particular \nanalysis. If pipelining is carried out, the bandwidth is sim- \nply multiplied by the appropriate coefficient. \nFor the same boundary conditions as those correspond- \ning to the plot in Fig. 3, the total bandwidth for changing N \nand S where the repeaters are optimally sized is plotted in \nFig. 5.

However optimal repeater \ninsertion results in a large number of huge buffers. Also it \nbas been shown in [ I ]  that the delay curve is quite flat, and \nthe sizes can be reduced with little increase in delay. \nInstead of optimal repeater insertion, if a constraint is \nimposed on the number and size of buffers for each line, \nthe optimal configuration does not equate to the maximum \nnumber of wires. Given in Fig. 6 is a plot of the bandwidth \nwhen a constraint of k=l and h=20 is laid down for each \nline. The optimal configuration corresponds to N=44, so \nthat the Nhk product is 880. \nTypically the constraint would be on the total area occu- \npied by the buffers, and hence k and k would be affected \nby N. If (18) describes the area constraint on the buffers, \nthe optimum configuration is the solution to the con- \nstrained optimisation problem of maximising ( 5 )  subject \nto(18). \nNkh SA, , ,  (18) \nThis adds a third independent variable to the objective \nfunction (5 ) ,  of either k or h since A, is a constant.

CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have canied out an analysis of delay \nwith worst-case cross-talk in capacitively coupled lossy \ninterconnects. In the important configuration of a large \nnumber of parallel lines, several factors combine to affect \nthe delay in various ways. Increased parallelism is desira- \nble in general, but when the total area that is allowed for \nthe wires is constrained, this results in smaller, more \ntightly coupled wires, causing greater line delay. Repeater \ninsertion and especially area constrained repeater insertion \nfurther complicates the issue. However we have demon- \nstrated models and a method of building an objective func- \ntion that takes all these factors into account and predicts \nthe optimum configuration. Additional considerations \nsuch as native word width constraints can easily be incor- \nporated. We propose these equations and the method of \nanalysis as being suitable for calculations early in the \ndesign flow, as the simplicity of the expressions allow for a \nlarge number of iterations. \n5.
