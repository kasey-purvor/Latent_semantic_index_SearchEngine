This is especially\ntrue of the cardiovascular system and brain, and an enor-\nmous amount of effort has been made in recent years to\ndevelop time series analysis for diagnostic applications,\ni.e., to find ways to determine the physiological state by\nanalysis of the corresponding complex signals. Measures\nof complexity have been developed that distinguish be-\ntween regular, chaotic, and random behaviors [1], and can\ntry to predict a heart attack or epileptic seizure [2,3].\nSynchronization and related phenomena in coupled com-\nplex systems [4] have been found to occur, not only in\nphysical, but also in many biological systems, e.g., the\ncardiorespiratory interaction [5\u20138] and neural signals [9\u2013\n13]. It is often important to detect, not only the existence of\nsynchronization, but also the predominant direction of the\ncoupling between the systems. The coupling direction [14]\nhas been extracted from the amplitudes of the system\nobservables by evaluation of their mutual predictability\n[9,10], or from mutual nearest neighbors in reconstructed\nstate spaces [15], or by use of information-theoretic ap-\nproaches [12,13,16].\nMost of these methods involve the quantification of\ncertain aspects of nearest neighbors in phase space and,\nas a result, are computationally expensive. Typically, the\ntime series is partitioned into m sections. The method in\nuse is then applied within each section; m can then be\nincreased in order to seek limiting behavior. The appro-\npriate partitions can be hard to find. To circumvent this\ndifficulty, Bandt and Pompe (BP) [1] suggest that the\nsymbol sequence should come naturally from the time\nseries, without further model assumptions, and that one\nshould therefore take partitions as given by comparisons of\nneighboring values of the series (see below).\nIn this Letter, we apply the BP approach to the direc-\ntionality index obtained from information theory [17],\nthereby deriving the system dynamics and directionality\nof the interacting systems. We test the scheme on a pair of\ncoupled van der Pol (VDP) oscillators and then apply it to\ncardiorespiratory time series from healthy subjects.\nWe first define the permutation entropy (PE). Consider a\ntime series fX\u0001t\u0002g: n consecutively numbered real data can\nbe sorted in an increasing order. In this way, we have n!\npermutations \u0001 of order n which are considered here as\npossible order types of n different numbers. So these n\npoints are mapped to one out of n! permutations. It is clear\nthat each point in the embedding space, indexed by i, can\nbe mapped to one of the n! permutations. When each such\npermutation is considered as a symbol, then the recon-\nstructed trajectory is represented by a symbol sequence.\nThe number of distinct symbols can be at most n!. Let the\nprobability distribution for the symbols be \u00011; \u00012; . . . ; \u0001k,\nwhere k \u0003 n!. Then the PE for the time series is defined [1]\nas the Shannon entropy for the k symbols H\u0001n\u0002 \u0004\n\u0005Pki\u00041 \u0001i ln\u0001i. The PE shows the same behavior for\ndifferent values of n [1]; it is also evident that use of the\nPE is extremely fast since it uses easy comparison between\nneighboring values, rather than partitioning the amplitude\ninto different sections (which must be optimized by trial\nand error). BP have shown that the PE is an appropriate\ncomplexity measure for chaotic time series, in particular, in\nthe presence of dynamical and observational noise. Unlike\nother complexity parameters, it is not significantly affected\nby weak noise.\nWe now introduce the information-theoretic tools. The\nconditional mutual information (CMI) [12] of two random\nvariables X1, X2, given the variable X3, is I\u0001X1;X2jX3\u0002 \u0004\nH\u0001X1jX3\u0002 \u0006H\u0001X2jX3\u0002 \u0005H\u0001X1; X2jX3\u0002. The entropies\nH\u0001X1jX3\u0002, H\u0001X2jX3\u0002, H\u0001X1; X2jX3\u0002 are taken in the PE\nsense. Consider two time series fX1\u0001t\u0002g and fX2\u0001t\u0002g repre-\nsenting the observables of two possibly coupled systems.\nDependence structures between the two processes, as re-\nvealed by their time series, can be studied using the simple\nmutual information I\u0001\u0001x2 ;\u0001x1\u0002\u0002, where points x2\u0001t\u0002 and\nx1\u0001t\u0006 \u0002\u0002 are mapped to \u0001x2 and \u0001x1\u0002 .

To do so,\nwe increment vectors of n points (in what follows we use\nn \u0004 3) of fX1g as x1\u0001ti\u0002 \u0005 x1\u0001ti\u0006\u0002\u0002, x1\u0001ti\u00061\u0002 \u0005\nx1\u0001ti\u0006\u0002\u00061\u0002; . . . ; x1\u0001ti\u0006n\u0002 \u0005 x1\u0001ti\u0006\u0002\u0006n\u0002 (\u0002 \u0007 n), and then\nmap these vector to \u0001\u0001x1 (\u0001\u0001x2 related to increments infX2g). We then introduce a directionality index (DI) defined\nin analogy with those of Rosenblum et al. [18,19] and\nPalus\u02c7 and Stefanovska [17]\n D12 \u0004 I12 \u0005 I21I12 \u0006 I21 ; (1)\nwhere the measure I12 of how system 1 drives system 2 is\nequal to the conditional mutual information I\u0001\u00011;\u0001\u0001x2 j\u00012\u0002\nfor a chosen time lag \u0002. Assuming that Iij \u0001 Iji \u0001 0, D12 is\npositive if the driving from system 1 to system 2 prevails,\nand negative for the opposite case.\nNonlinear oscillators have been a subject of particular\ninterest in recent years [8,20,21] on account of their im-\nportance for modeling phenomena and processes in, e.g.,\nphysics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Among\nthem, the self-sustained classical VDP oscillator often\nserves as a paradigm for smoothly oscillating limit cycle\nor relaxation oscillations. So, before applying our new\nmethod to determine directionality in a cardiorespiratory\nsignal, we test it by investigating directionality in a pair of\ncoupled VDP oscillators.\n \n\u0002x1 \u0005\u0003\u00011\u0005 x21\u0002 _x1 \u0006!1x1 \u0006 \u00041x2 \u0004 \u00051\u0001t\u0002;\n\u0002x2 \u0005\u0003\u00011\u0005 x22\u0002 _x2 \u0006!2x2 \u0006 \u00042x1 \u0004 \u00052\u0001t\u0002:\n(2)\nWe set !1;2 \u0004 1\b 0:05, and consider mutually indepen-\ndent Gaussian noises of zero mean and covariance\n\u0005i\u0001t\u0002\u0005j\u0001t0\u0002 \u0004 \u00062\u0007\u0001t\u0005 t0\u0002\u0007i;j with standard deviation \u0006j \u0004\n0:3 for j \u0004 1, 2. We have used two coupled VDP oscillators\nand fixed all the parameters except the coupling from\noscillator 1 to 2, \u00042, and vice versa \u00041. Thus any change\ndetected by our directionality method can be related to\nchanges made in the actual couplings between the two\nsystems: the sign and magnitude of the calculated direc-\ntionality index should reflect the coupling asymmetry im-\nplemented. We generate time series of x1;2\u0001t\u0002 for different\nfixed values of the coupling parameters \u00041 and \u00042. In\nanalogy with the analysis techniques for cardiorespiratory\ndata, we extract instantaneous frequencies of the two os-\ncillators by using the marked events method [22]. The Iij\nwere averaged over a short range of lags (5\u201310 s) to\ndecrease fluctuations of the estimates. To test the signifi-\ncance of our results, we used surrogate data [17,23]; here,\nrealizations in which the data were randomly shuffled in\n100 different ways, were used. Estimating the CMIs and\nDIs for the surrogate data sets, we assessed the fluctuations\nof these quantities for data where there could be neither\ncoupling nor directionality. We illustrate the range within\nwhich 95% of the surrogate Iij fall by the dashed lines in\nFig. 1, labeled as I\tij. Only those CMIs and corresponding\nDIs that lie in the 5% of the right-hand tail of probability\ndensity function (pdf) of realizations of surrogate data are\ninferred as significant. The dependence of D12 on \u00041 when\n\u00042 is fixed at 0.1, is shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). It is clear\nthat the bigger \u00041, the larger and more negative D12 be-\ncomes (when \u00041 \u0004 \u00042 the accuracy is decreased).

For\nadditional validation, we have also derived the same quan-\ntity for other regimes: by fixing \u00042 \u0004 0:5 and changing \u00041.\nIn this case too the directionality D12 varied in the manner\nexpected. Figure 2 illustrates the sensitivity of this ap-\nproach in detecting changes in directionality with time.\nInitially, \u00041 \u0004 0:5 and \u00042 \u0004 0:1; then, at t \u0004 11 000, the\nvalues of \u00041, \u00042 were reversed. This event is clearly de-\ntected by the corresponding changes in I12, I21, and D12.\nThe figure also provides a useful indication of the variation\nin time of the DI and CMIs using 2000 s windows.\nGiven that the ratio of cardiac and respiratory frequen-\ncies can in practice be rather large, we have also studied\nsystems (2) with such frequency ratios as !1:!2 \u0004 4:1.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3. The DI D12 detects the\ncorrect coupling directionality for the majority of the\ncoupling parameter values. Again we have investigated\ntwo cases, first fixing \u00042 \u0004 0:1 and taking different values\nof \u00041, and secondly vice versa. The DI successfully reveals\nthe correct relationships. Comparison of the left and right-\nhand parts of 3(a) illustrates an important feature of\ncoupled oscillators with different frequencies: that the\ninfluence of the lower frequency oscillator on the higher\none is in general stronger than in the opposite case.\nCardiorespiratory data was obtained from a group of 20\nhealthy subjects (age 66\b 6, median 64, 9 F and 11 M).\nThe data were all recorded noninvasively for 30 min with\nthe subjects in repose [24] using, respectively, a 3-lead\nECG system and piezoresistive sensor attached to a belt\naround the thorax. A sampling rate of 400 Hz was used.\nNone of the subjects was on medication or had any history\nof cardiovascular disease.\nThe instantaneous frequencies of the cardiac and respi-\nratory oscillations were extracted using the marked events\nmethod [22]. The CMIs I21 and I12, and the DI D12, were\nthen calculated as shown for a typical example in Fig. 4\nwith confidence level of 95% of 1000 realizations of the\nsurrogate data. Here, 1 represents the cardiac and 2 repre-\nsents the respiratory system. It was found that I12 was\nbigger than I21 for 18 subjects, showing that respiration\ndrives the heart more than vice versa, an outcome that is\nconsistent with the results of methods developed for de-\ntecting the coupling directionality of interacting phases\n[17,19], and with direct physiological observations. Note\nthat D12 was found to be negative for all subjects, but our\nsurrogate data test reveals (with a 95% level of confidence)\nthat its value is statistically significant in only 18 out of 20\ncases. This simply means that for the remaining 2 subjects,\nno statistically meaningful result can be derived with this\nlevel of confidence. If we reduce the required level of\nconfidence to, e.g., 75%, the I21 indices for these two\nsubjects also lie in the significant area. This actually has\na physical explanation, which is due to intersubject differ-\nences. Certainly, all the subjects are different because of\ncomplex behavior of the human body and also because of\nthe different conditions of different subjects. Therefore, for\nsome of the subject we can recognize the pattern of direc-\ntionality with 100% accuracy, but for others, the accuracy\nis smaller. Nevertheless, the method can still recognize the\ndirectionality pattern for all of the subjects, conditional on\nacceptance of a lower level of significance. In fact, com-\nparison with surrogates saves us from making an unreliable\ninference of the directionality, at the same time, one de-\n1 0.5 0.1 0.5 1\n0\n0.01\n0.02\nI12\nI*12\nI21\nI*21\n\u03b51 \u03b52\n(a)\nIij\n1 0.5 0.1 0.5 1\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03b51 \u03b52\n(b)\nD12\nFIG. 3.

The necessity of\nestablishing the significance level is obvious, as even rela-\ntively large positive values of I12 do not necessarily reflect\nthe presence of a driver response.\nIn summary, our PI method enables the quantification of\nthe directionality of coupling between interacting oscilla-\ntors and the detection of dynamical changes in complex\ntime series, which are needed not only in relation to the\ncardiovascular system but also in the study of superachias-\nmatic nucleus neurons [20], brain waves, and the heart [8],\nand the modeling of calcium oscillations in living cells\n[21]. By analyzing two coupled VDP oscillators as well as\na number of cardiorespiratory data, we have shown that the\nPI can indeed be effectively used to detect driver-response\nrelationships between the systems studied. Compared to\nearlier approaches [17,23], the PI method is faster, since\nmaking and optimizing partitions needs time, whereas here\nthe partitions come out naturally without any model as-\nsumptions. Moreover, noise has less influence here as we\ndo not use values related to amplitudes: we just compare\nconsecutive points. Even for relatively large noise inten-\nsity, we expect local effects to be relatively small whereas,\nfor partitions computed from the whole signal, the errors\ninduced by noise are much bigger. The most attractive\nfeatures of the PI method, namely, its conceptual simplicity\nand computational efficiency, make it an excellent candi-\ndate for a fast and useful screener and detector of unusual\npatterns in complex coupled time series.\nWe thank M.

The index 1 is\nrelated to the heart and 2 to respiration. The observed negativity\nof D12 in (b) implies that respiration is driving cardiac activity.\nThe dashed lines in (a) are surrogate data (see text).\nPRL 100, 084101 (2008) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending29 FEBRUARY 2008\n084101-4\n"}
