However, nothing is known 18 \nabout the wider Antarctic distribution of R. ericae in C. varians, and inoculation experiments 19 \nconfirming the ability of the fungus to form coils in the liverwort are lacking. 20 \n\uf0b7 Using direct isolation and baiting with Vaccinium macrocarpon seedlings, we isolated fungi 21 \nfrom C. varians sampled from eight sites across a 1,875 km transect through sub- and maritime 22 \nAntarctica, from Bird Island on South Georgia (54 \u00b0S, 38 \u00b0W) through to Alexander Island (71 23 \n\u00b0S, 68 \u00b0W) on the western Antarctic Peninsula. We also tested the ability of an isolate to form 24 \ncoils in aseptically-grown C. varians.  25 \n\uf0b7 Fungi with 98-99% sequence identity to R. ericae internal transcribed spacer region and partial 26 \nlarge subunit ribosomal (r)DNA sequences were frequently isolated from C. varians at all sites 27 \nsampled. The EF4\/Fung5 primer set did not amplify small subunit rDNA from three of five R. 28 \nericae isolates, probably accounting for the reported absence of the fungus from C. varians in a 29 \nprevious study. R. ericae was found to colonize aseptically-grown C. varians intracellularly, 30 \nforming hyphal coils. 31 \n\uf0b7 This study shows that the association between R. ericae and C. varians is apparently widespread 32 \nin Antarctica and confirms that R. ericae is at least in part responsible for the formation of the 33 \ncoils observed in rhizoids of field-collected C. varians. 34 \n 35 \n 36 \nKey words: Cephaloziella varians, dark septate endophyte, ericoid mycorrhiza, Rhizoscyphus 37 \nericae, liverwort, maritime and sub-Antarctica 38 \n39 \n 3 \nIntroduction 40 \nA range of leafy hepatics in the Jungermannopsida consistently form associations with 41 \nascomycetous fungi (Read et al., 2000), forming \u2018mycothalli\u2019 (Boullard, 1988). In a study of British 42 \nhepatics, species of the leafy liverwort genus Cephaloziella were found to possess fungal 43 \nassociations restricted to rhizoids, with over half of the rhizoid tips colonized (Duckett et al., 1991). 44 \nFungal colonization of rhizoids is characterized by dense intracellular growth that appears 45 \nanalogous to ericoid mycorrhizal coils (Selosse, 2005). The functional nature of the relationship 46 \nbetween liverworts and their endophytic fungi is not known, but the formation of structures similar 47 \nto those seen in ericoid mycorrhizal roots suggests an active role in plant survival (Read et al., 48 \n2000).  49 \nCephaloziella varians (Gottsche) Steph. is the most widespread species of liverwort in 50 \nAntarctica, occurring in the maritime, continental and sub-Antarctic regions (Bednarek-Ochyra et 51 \nal., 2000). As in British Cephaloziella, hyphae and rudimentary coils of ascomycetous fungal 52 \nendophytes are present in the rhizoids of this leafy liverwort collected from Botany Bay, Granite 53 \nharbour (77 \u00b0S, 162 \u00b0E) and the Bailey Peninsula in the Windmill Islands (66 \u00b0S, 110 \u00b0E), both in 54 \neastern continental Antarctica (Williams et al., 1994). Colonies of isolates from C. varians collected 55 \nfrom these locations are slow-growing, waxy and become dark brown to black with age (Williams 56 \net al., 1994). Using the ITS1\/ITS4 primer set, Chambers et al. (1999) sequenced the internal 57 \ntranscribed spacer (ITS) region of an isolate from the Bailey Peninsula and showed it to have a high 58 \n(99.4%) sequence identity to the type culture of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Hymenoscyphus 59 \nericae, recently renamed as Rhizoscyphus ericae (D.J. Read) W.H. Zhuang & Korf. (Zhang & 60 \nZhuang, 2004). In contrast, direct PCR analysis using the EF4\/Fung5 primer set, which targeted a 61 \nregion of the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal (r)RNA gene, suggested that fungi bearing strong 62 \naffinities to R. ericae are absent from C. varians at Rothera Point in the maritime Antarctic 63 \n(Jumpponen et al., 2003). 64 \n 4 \nGiven the current uncertainty about the distribution of R. ericae in C. varians in Antarctica, we 65 \naddressed the question of whether or not R. ericae is consistently isolated from the tissues of the 66 \nliverwort collected from a wide range of locations in the maritime and sub-Antarctic. We also tested 67 \nwhether the EF4\/Fung5 primer set might not be appropriate for the amplification of R. ericae DNA, 68 \npossibly owing to the presence of introns in the SSU rDNA (Jumpponen et al., 2003). A re-69 \ninoculation experiment also determined whether or not R. ericae forms structures similar to those 70 \nobserved in field-collected shoots. Finally, we tested the ability of Antarctic R. ericae to form 71 \nhyphal coils in the roots of an ericaceous plant species. 72 \n 73 \nMaterials and Methods 74 \nField sampling 75 \n 76 \nCephaloziella varians was collected during the 2002 and 2005 austral summers from field sites at 77 \nBird Island on South Georgia, Signy, Lynch and Coronation Islands in the South Orkneys, King 78 \nGeorge and Livingston Islands in the South Shetlands, and Adelaide and Alexander Islands on the 79 \nwestern Antarctic Peninsula (Fig. 1; Table 1). Sites on the South Orkney, South Shetland and Bird 80 \nIslands were reached by helicopter or small boat from ships. The site on Adelaide Island was 81 \nreached on foot from the nearby British Antarctic Survey Rothera Research Station, and that at 82 \nAlexander Island was reached by fixed-wing aircraft fitted with skis, also from Rothera. At least 83 \nfive samples of C. varians mat (up to 50 \u00d7 50 mm) were removed from each site with a knife wiped 84 \nwith sterilant (Virkon\n\u00ae\n; Antec International Ltd., Sudbury, UK) between samples and placed in a 85 \nre-sealable polythene bag. 86 \n 87 \nTreatment of plant material after sampling 88 \n 89 \n 5 \nPlants of C. varians sampled from the South Shetland Islands were initially stored for several days 90 \nat 4\u00b0C in cool boxes, then maintained for 12 wk in growth cabinets set to a 16 h cycle of light (300 91 \n\u00b5mol photons m\n-2\n s\n-1\n at 6\u00b0C) and 8 h of darkness (4\u00b0C). Those sampled from the South Orkney and 92 \nAdelaide Islands were maintained for 5 to 8 wk under the growth conditions described above and 93 \nwere sprayed with sterile distilled water (dH2O) to keep tissues moist. Plants sampled from 94 \nAlexander Island were stored for 4 h in a cool box prior to return to Rothera research station. Those 95 \nsampled from Bird Island were frozen within several hours of collection at \u201320\u00b0C for 8 wk. 96 \nAll samples except those from Alexander Island were returned to the UK. On arrival, 97 \nsamples from the South Orkney, South Shetland and Adelaide Islands were transported at 4\u00b0C to 98 \nthe ANNEX growth room facility at the University of Sheffield. Plants from these locations were 99 \ntransferred to sterile Petri dishes (100 mm \uf0b4 100 mm; Bibby Sterilin, Stone, UK) and sprayed as 100 \nnecessary with sterile dH2O to keep tissues moist. Samples from different sites were kept in 101 \nseparate closed dishes. Plants were maintained under the same growth conditions as those described 102 \nabove for between 1 and 16 wk.   103 \n 104 \nMicroscopy analyses of field-collected Cephaloziella varians  105 \n 106 \nUnstained or stained C. varians shoots, collected 6 wk previously from Rothera Point and 107 \ntransferred back to the UK in a growth cabinet under the conditions described above, were 108 \nexamined under bright field illumination (Olympus BX51; Olympus, Southall, UK). For staining, 109 \nshoots were cleared in 10% KOH for 24 h, washed in dH2O, acidified in 10% HCl for 1 h, and 110 \ntransferred to 0.05% aniline blue (0.25 g aniline blue, 25 ml dH2O, 475 ml lactic acid) for 1 h and 111 \nthen to de-staining solution (25 ml dH2O, 475 ml lactic acid) for 2 h. Shoots were then mounted on 112 \nmicroscope slides in lactoglycerol (14:1:1; lactic acid: glycerol: dH2O). 113 \n 114 \nIsolation of fungi from Cephaloziella varians 115 \n 6 \n 116 \nFungi were isolated directly from shoots collected from Bird, Signy, King George, Adelaide and 117 \nAlexander Islands. Samples from Bird Island were defrosted overnight at 4\u00b0C prior to isolations. 118 \nFungi from Alexander Island were isolated immediately after return to Rothera research station. 119 \nFrom each of the five samples of C. varians collected from a given site, c. 25 mg (FW) of the 120 \nuppermost 10 mm of shoot was placed into 10 ml sterile dH2O in a Universal bottle. Shoots were 121 \nserially washed in 20 changes of sterile dH2O for 5 min per wash on a wrist-action shaker at 7 beats 122 \ns\n-1\n. Shoots were blotted on sterile filter paper, cut into 1-2 mm length segments and plated into 123 \neither 10% modified Melin-Norkrans agar (MMN; acidified to pH 4\uf0d75 with 10% HCl) medium or 124 \n1% malt extract agar (MEA) medium in 90 mm Petri dishes. Each dish contained five segments of 125 \nshoot, plated equidistantly in the agar medium. Between 12 and 20 dishes of each agar medium 126 \nwere prepared per site. Dishes were incubated in the dark at 18\u00b0C and checked daily for 14 d then 127 \nweekly for 10 wk. The number of fungal colonies present was recorded, and the most common 128 \nfungal morphotype sub-cultured onto 10% MMN and 1% MEA media and stored in the dark at 129 \n18\u00b0C. 130 \n 131 \nIsolation of fungi from Vaccinium macrocarpon bait seedlings 132 \n 133 \nSeeds of V. macrocarpon were sterilized for 10 min in calcium hypochlorite solution (1:28, w\/v) 134 \nfollowed by three rinses in sterile dH2O, and were germinated on 1.5% plant agar medium (Duchefa 135 \nBiochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands). Five uncontaminated, two-week-old V. macrocarpon 136 \nseedlings were each planted into C. varians mat from Coronation, Lynch, Signy, King George, 137 \nLivingston and Adelaide Islands. The mats were placed into Petri dishes, which were sealed with 138 \nParafilm and maintained under the same growth conditions as those described above for 8 wk. 139 \nFive 10 mm root segments were arbitrarily selected from each of the five V. macrocarpon 140 \nplants growing in C. varians collected from each site. Five of the 25 segments from each site were 141 \n 7 \neach placed into 10 ml sterile dH2O, were serially washed as described above, and, after blotting, 142 \nplated into 10% MMN and 1% MEA media. Between 10 and 15 dishes of each agar medium were 143 \nprepared, incubated at 18\u00b0C and checked as above.  144 \n 145 \nCharacterization and quantification of fungi   146 \n 147 \nMacroscopic and microscopic features of colonies were noted after growth for 20 d in the dark at 148 \n18\u00b0C on 1% MEA medium. Sub-cultures of each were transferred to 5\u00b0C in an attempt to induce 149 \nsporulation (Richard & Fortin, 1973). The type cultures of Rhizoscyphus ericae (Read 100 and 101) 150 \nwere used for comparison with fungal isolates. Isolation frequency was calculated as the number of 151 \ncolonies \/ the total number of liverwort or root segments plated \u00d7 100%. 152 \n 153 \nMolecular characterization of dominant fungal morphotype 154 \n 155 \nDNA extraction and sequencing. Using the method of Cubero et al. (1999), DNA was extracted 156 \nfrom 23 isolates of the most frequent fungal morphotype from Bird, Signy, Lynch, Coronation, 157 \nKing George, Livingston, Adelaide and Alexander Islands. The fungal specific primer ITS1F 158 \n(Gardes & Bruns, 1993) and the universal primer ITS4 (White et al., 1990) were used to amplify the 159 \nITS region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) between the SSU and large subunit (LSU) rDNA. The primers NL5 160 \nand NL8 (Egger, 1995) were used to amplify a partial 5\u2019 section of the LSU, including the D1\/D2 161 \nregion, from three of the isolates. 162 \nPCR amplifications were carried out in 34 \uf06dl volumes, consisting of 30 \uf06dl ReddyMix PCR 163 \nmix (Abgene, Epsom, UK), 2 \uf06dl template DNA and 1 \uf06dl of each primer, on a PTC-225 Peltier 164 \nthermal cycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA, USA). Each amplification included a negative 165 \ncontrol in which 2 \uf06dl of sterile ddH2O was substituted for the DNA template. Ice-cold reaction 166 \ntubes were preheated for initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 167 \n 8 \ndenaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 54\u00b0C for 1 min and synthesis at 72\u00b0C for 70 s, 168 \nfollowed by a final extension step of 68\u00b0C for 10 min. Detectable PCR products were purified and 169 \ntarget rDNA regions sequenced using a MegaBACE 1000 sequencer (Molecular Dynamics, 170 \nSunnyvale, CA, USA). The sequencing reactions were repeated for both forward and reverse 171 \nprimers. 172 \n 173 \nPhylogenetic analyses. Consensus sequences were produced for the ITS and LSU sequences 174 \nobtained from this study using BioEdit (version 7.0.4.1; Hall, 1999), initially with the ClustalW 175 \noption (Thompson et al., 1994), and thereafter manually by visual inspection. NCBI BLAST 176 \n(Altschul et al., 1997) and Fasta searches (Fasta fungi and Fasta env) (Pearson & Lipman, 1988; 177 \nhttp:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/fasta33\/nucleotide.html) were carried out for each ITS and LSU consensus 178 \nsequence. The exact positioning of the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 along sequences was determined using 179 \npaired alignments with BLAST matches and information deposited in GenBank. ITS sequences 180 \nwere then aligned with the Hymenoscyphus (\u2261 Rhizoscyphus) ericae aggregate (sensu Vr\u00e5lstad et 181 \nal., 2000) alignment deposited in TreeBASE by Hambleton & Sigler (2005) 182 \n(http:\/\/www.treebase.org\/treebase\/; study accession no. S1393). In order to align sequences from 183 \nthe current study with more distantly related taxa in the deposited alignment, the 5\u2019 partial SSU 184 \nsequence and the first c. 23 bp of ITS1 were removed. ITS sequences were further shortened to 318-185 \n397 bp by removing the 3\u2019 partial LSU sequence and the last c. 61 bp of ITS2 to accommodate 186 \nshorter sequences. Similarly, LSU sequences were shortened to 397 bp to align with those from a 187 \nbroad selection of Leotiomycetous taxa and selected Pezizomycetes. The aligned sequences were 188 \nthen subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method (Saitou & Nei, 189 \n1987) in MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004) with the Kimura two-parameter model. Gaps or 190 \nmissing data were excluded from analyses and a uniform rate of mutation was assumed across sites. 191 \nRobustness of phylogenetic trees was assayed using 1000 NJ bootstrap replications (Felsenstein, 192 \n1985). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers 000000-000000. 193 \n 9 \n 194 \n 195 \nComparison of ITS1F\/ITS4 and EF4\/Fung5 primer sets. Three isolates of the dominant fungal 196 \nmorphotype from C. varians tissue and two from V. macrocarpon bait seedling roots were used for 197 \nthese analyses. Two Phoma herbarum isolates were used for comparison. All seven isolates 198 \noriginated from Rothera Point. DNA extraction from the isolates and PCR amplification were 199 \ncarried out as described above for the primer sets ITS1F\/ITS4 and EF4\/Fung5 (Smit et al., 1999), 200 \nexcept that the PCR cycle parameters used for the latter set were those used by Jumpponen et al. 201 \n(2003). The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel. 202 \n 203 \nSynthesis experiments 204 \n 205 \nInoculation of Cephaloziella varians. Axenic gametophytes of C. varians were obtained from 206 \nspores. Sporophytes were carefully removed from laboratory-grown C. varians using sterile fine 207 \nforceps under a sterile flow hood. Several sporophytes were attached to the lid of a 90 mm Petri 208 \ndish using sterile lanolin so that the sporophyte hung c. 5 mm above the surface of 1.5% plant agar 209 \nmedium. Dishes were sealed with Parafilm and maintained under the same growth conditions as 210 \nthose described above. A fresh lid was placed on the dish under a sterile flow hood when spores 211 \nwere seen on the agar medium surface. Ten gametophytes were each aseptically transferred to Petri 212 \ndishes containing 1.5% plant agar medium when they reached c. 1 mm diameter. An 8 mm diameter 213 \n1.2% water agar medium plug, inoculated 14 d previously with an isolate of the most frequent 214 \nfungal morphotype from Rothera Point, was positioned 20 mm from each of five C. varians 215 \ngametophytes. An uninoculated 1.2% water agar plug was placed 20 mm from the each of the 216 \nremaining gametophytes. Petri dishes were sealed with Parafilm, wrapped with aluminium foil and 217 \na hole was made in the foil above the gametophyte in order to admit light. Gametophytes were 218 \ngrown under the same conditions as those described above. 219 \n 10 \nShoots were harvested 8 wk after hyphae had reached the gametophytes. They were viewed 220 \nunstained or stained with aniline blue under bright field or UV fluorescence.  221 \n 222 \nInoculation of Vaccinium macrocarpon. Polycarbonate Magenta\n\u00ae\n growth vessels (Sigma-Aldrich, 223 \nSt Louis, MO, USA), fitted with 0.22 \uf06dm filter lids, were filled to a depth of 30 mm with 180 ml of 224 \n20% Rorison\u2019s nutrient solution (pH 5.4, with 0.5 g L-1 activated charcoal and 15 g L-1 agar). 225 \nVessels and growth medium were sterilised at 121\u00b0C for 15 min and cooled to room temperature. 226 \nFive axenically-grown V. macrocarpon seedlings, germinated as described above, were 227 \ntransferred to each of two growth vessels, and were inoculated with 1 ml macerate, consisting of 228 \neither uninoculated or inoculated pieces of 1.2% water agar (20 \uf0b4 10 \uf0b4 6 mm) in 15 ml sterile 229 \ndH2O. Inoculated water agar had been cut under sterile conditions from the growing margin of the 230 \nsame isolate from Rothera Point that was used to inoculate C. varians, which had been grown for 2 231 \nwk at 18\u00b0C in the dark. The growth vessels were sealed with Parafilm, transferred to the growth 232 \nroom and maintained under the same growth conditions as those described above. Plants were 233 \ngrown for 12 wk prior to harvest.  234 \nUpon harvest, V. macrocarpon roots were rinsed free of growth medium with sterile dH2O 235 \nand were qualitatively assessed for the presence of ericoid coils in cortical cells. Roots from each 236 \nplant were observed unstained or stained with aniline blue under bright field and UV fluorescence, 237 \nas described above. For staining, V. macrocarpon roots were dipped in 10% HCl, transferred to 238 \n0.05% aniline blue for 10 min and rinsed in sterile dH2O. 239 \n 240 \nResults 241 \nMicroscopy analyses of field-collected Cephaloziella varians  242 \n 243 \nA network of dark septate \u2018runner\u2019 hyphae (c. 2 \uf06dm diameter) covered the caulid surfaces of C. 244 \nvarians sampled from Rothera Point (Fig. 2a, b). Hyphae commonly entered caulid cells (Fig. 2b) 245 \n 11 \nand colonised rhizoids (Fig. 2c), both in the apical and distal regions of the liverwort. Dark septate 246 \nhyphae on caulid surfaces formed a continuum with intracellular pigmented, hyaline and aniline 247 \nblue-staining septate hyphae, which were frequently observed to proliferate within cells, forming 248 \nhyphal coils (Fig. 2d). The basal regions of rhizoids were also filled with hyphal coils (not shown). 249 \nPigmented, hyaline and aniline blue-staining septate hyphae were apparently able to pass from cell 250 \nto cell by directly penetrating the cell wall, with no evidence of cell necrosis. 251 \n 252 \nCharacterization and quantification of fungi 253 \n 254 \nA single morphotype, morphotype 1, was the most frequently-isolated fungus from C. varians 255 \ntissue collected from Bird, Signy, King George, Adelaide and Alexander Islands (Table 2). Between 256 \none and three other morphotypes of dematiaceous fungi were isolated from C. varians from each of 257 \nthese locations (Table 2). Colonies of morphotype 1 were slow growing, with a mean radial 258 \nextension rate of 3.0 (\u00b1 0.13) mm wk\n-1\n, were often waxy and lacked dense aerial hyphae, except for 259 \nin the centre of the colony, where ropes were formed. After 20 d, colonies of the morphotype were 260 \ndark greenish grey from above with a white margin and were dark brown with a cream margin from 261 \nbelow. They became dark brown with age. Sporulation structures were not observed in any cultures 262 \nof morphotype 1, including those incubated at 5\u00b0C. 263 \nColonies of morphotype 1 also dominated the fungal isolates from roots of V. macrocarpon 264 \nbait seedlings grown in C. varians mats from Coronation, Lynch, Signy, King George, Livingston 265 \nand Adelaide Islands (Table 2). It was the only morphotype isolated from V. macrocarpon roots 266 \ngrown in mats from Coronation, King George and Adelaide Islands. One or two other morphotypes 267 \nof fungi were isolated from each of the other locations (Table 2). Fungi were not isolated from the 268 \nroots of uninoculated V. macrocarpon bait seedlings. 269 \n 270 \nMolecular characterization of dominant fungal morphotype  271 \n 12 \n 272 \nPhylogenetic analyses. Isolates of morphotype 1 produced single amplification products of c. 600 273 \nbp for both ITS and LSU sequences. Negative controls produced no amplification products. 274 \nConsensus sequences of c. 425-610 bp were produced. Two isolates, Vm_ByP_S13 and 275 \nVm_MaP_S20 (see footnote to Table 3 for an explanation of isolate codes), were missing all or a 276 \nlarge proportion of the ITS2 region and were therefore removed from all further analyses. These 277 \nsequences matched R. ericae (AY394907) with 99% identity over their entire lengths. The sequence 278 \nidentity between all other morphotype 1 isolates was 97-100% over the entire ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 279 \nregion. All morphotype 1 sequences retrieved R. ericae as the top taxonomically-identified BLAST 280 \nmatch, showing 98-99% sequence identity over the entire ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region (Table 3). 281 \nMorphotype 1 isolates and the isolate from C. varians on the Bailey Peninsula in eastern Antarctica 282 \n(AF069439) had 97-99% sequence identity over the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region. NJ analysis of 283 \nmorphotype 1 partial ITS sequences showed them to group with 99% bootstrap support within the 284 \nH. ericae aggregate and with 81% bootstrap support within the R. ericae clade, alongside sequences 285 \nobtained for the isolate from the Bailey Peninsula, and others from vascular plant species in 286 \nAustralia, Norway, Canada, the USA and the UK (Fig. 3).  287 \nThe sequence identity between morphotype 1 isolates Cv_PoC_D3, Cv_RoP_D5 and 288 \nCv_MoV_M1 was 97-99% over the partial LSU region. BLAST searches retrieved R. ericae 289 \nsequences as the best match for the three LSU sequences, showing 98-99% identity (Table 3). NJ 290 \nanalysis clustered the partial LSU sequences together in a 73% bootstrap-supported monophyletic 291 \ngroup with R. ericae sequences (Fig. 4).  292 \n 293 \nComparison of ITS1F\/ITS4 and EF4\/Fung5 primer sets. All seven isolates produced 294 \namplification products of c. 600 bp for the ITS1F\/ITS4 primer combination, whereas only the 295 \nmorphotype 1 isolates Vm_RoP_23 and Vm_RoP_22 and the two Phoma herbarum isolates 296 \nproduced amplification products with the EF4\/Fung5 primer set (not shown). The amplification 297 \n 13 \nproducts from the former two isolates, the first of which produced a very faint band, were c. 1000 298 \nbp and those from the latter two were c. 600 bp in length (not shown). The morphotype 1 isolates 299 \nCv_RoP_D6, Cv_RoP_D5 and Cv_RoP_R07 failed to amplify with the EF4\/Fung5 primer set. 300 \n 301 \nSynthesis experiments 302 \n 303 \nInoculation of Cephaloziella varians. The patterns of colonization observed in the inoculated 304 \nplants of C. varians were similar to those seen in field-collected plants. The morphotype 1 isolate 305 \nCv_RoP_D5 was found to colonize and form penetration structures on rhizoid and axial cells of C. 306 \nvarians shoots. As in field-collected shoots, R. ericae hyphae grew within rhizoid (Fig. 5a) and 307 \naxial cells. Hyphae ramified throughout the entire shoot, forming a loose network of runner hyphae 308 \nover axial surfaces, and frequently formed intracellular hyaline septate hyphal coils (Fig. 5b). In 309 \nsome rhizoids, hyphae branched into fan-like structures at the base of the cell, with hyphae directly 310 \npenetrating the cell wall and entering neighbouring cells. There was no fungal colonization of 311 \nuninoculated shoots. 312 \n 313 \nInoculation of Vaccinium macrocarpon. Well-defined intracellular hyphal coils frequently 314 \ndeveloped in root epidermal cells of V. macrocarpon seedlings that had been inoculated with 315 \nCv_RoP_D5 (not shown). There was no fungal colonization of uninoculated control plants. 316 \n 317 \nDiscussion 318 \nThe current study has shown R. ericae to be present in C. varians from eight locations in the 319 \nAntarctic, spanning a 1,875 km southward transect from Bird Island on South Georgia through to 320 \nMoutonn\u00e9e Valley on Alexander Island, at the southern limit of the maritime Antarctic. Direct 321 \nisolations showed the fungus to grow from as many as half of the segments of liverwort shoot 322 \nplated into agar media, with relatively few colonies of other morphotypes isolated. The study has 323 \n 14 \nthus significantly extended the known range of the Cephaloziella varians-Rhizoscyphus ericae 324 \nassociation in Antarctica, and, along with the data of Chambers et al. (1999), strongly suggests that 325 \nthe association is a consistent relationship in Antarctic plant communities. Other than the widely-326 \ndocumented occurrence of lichens in the Antarctic (e.g. \u00d8vstedal & Smith, 2001), we are unaware 327 \nof any other reports in the literature of consistent associations between autotrophs and fungi on the 328 \ncontinent. 329 \nThe data reported here are at variance with those of Jumpponen et al. (2003), who found no 330 \nevidence that R. ericae was present at Rothera Point, a location from which several isolates of the 331 \nfungus were obtained in the current study. It is apparent from the data shown here that the 332 \nEF4\/Fung5 primer set used by Jumpponen et al. (2003) in their direct PCR study is not suitable for 333 \nthe amplification of R. ericae DNA: using this primer set, SSU region DNA from three of five R. 334 \nericae isolates from Rothera Point failed to amplify, and the c. 1000 bp product size of the other 335 \ntwo isolates, compared with the c. 600 bp products of two Phoma herbarum isolates, implied the 336 \npresence of a c. 400 bp insertion in the SSU region of the R. ericae DNA. As suggested by 337 \nJumpponen et al. (2003), it is possible that the presence of introns, which are frequent in the SSU 338 \nrDNA of R. ericae (Perotto et al., 2000), could have interfered with PCR amplification in their 339 \nstudy, leading to the absence of R. ericae sequences from clone libraries.  340 \nFor the first time, the present study performed Koch\u2019s postulates for the C. varians-R. ericae 341 \nassociation, inoculating axenically-grown liverwort with an isolate of the fungus from the plant. 342 \nThese experiments confirmed that the fungus is able to form hyphal coils similar to those observed 343 \nin field-collected plants, indicating that the loose coil observed in the base of a C. varians rhizoid 344 \ncell by Williams et al. (1994) was indeed most probably formed by R. ericae. We cannot, however, 345 \ndiscount the fact that other fungi capable of forming hyphal coils may be present in the tissues of C. 346 \nvarians. We similarly cannot discount the possibility that the favourable conditions under which the 347 \nliverwort was grown in cabinets account for the abundance of coils observed in shoots in the present 348 \n 15 \nstudy. Further studies will therefore measure the frequency of coils in tissues of C. varians sampled 349 \ndirectly from maritime and sub-Antarctic sites.  350 \nIn contrast with the data of Williams et al. (1994), the entry points of R. ericae into C. 351 \nvarians tissues in the current study were not restricted to rhizoids, and hyphae were found to 352 \ncolonize the whole plant except for the apical meristem, frequently forming coils within axial cells. 353 \nWilliams et al. (1994) concluded that the fungal structures observed in C. varians resembled those 354 \ndescribed as mycorrhizas or mycothalli. The current study indicates that the latter term is the more 355 \nappropriate, owing to the apparent systemic growth of the fungus and the fact that C. varians lacks 356 \nflagelliform axes, which might be considered to function in an analogous way to roots (Duckett et 357 \nal., 1991). In other liverwort-fungal associations the fungal partner does not grow systemically, but 358 \nproliferates in particular regions, such as in the rhizoids of other members of the Cephaloziaceae or 359 \nin the inner stem region of members of the Lophoziaceae, Arnelliaceae and Scapaniaceae (Read et 360 \nal., 2000). Fungal hyphae within tissues of British Cephaloziella species similarly appear to be 361 \nrestricted to rhizoid cells and are not present in the walls between the contiguous bases of colonized 362 \nrhizoids (Duckett et al., 1991).  363 \nPrevious work has shown ascomycetous associates of the liverwort genera Cephalozia and 364 \nKurzia to form ericoid mycorrhizas with axenically-grown plants of Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium 365 \nspp., which co-occur with the liverworts in the same habitats (Duckett & Read, 1995). Despite the 366 \nabsence of ericaceous plant species from maritime and continental Antarctica, the current study 367 \nsimilarly found that an isolate of R. ericae from Rothera Point was able to form coils in the root hair 368 \ncells of Vaccinium macrocarpon. Although further experiments are required to assess the effects of 369 \nAntarctic R. ericae isolates on ericaceous plants, this suggests that such isolates may not have lost 370 \ntheir ability to form functional relationships with higher plant roots.  371 \nThe formation of hyphal coil-like structures, which maximise the surface area of contact 372 \nbetween symbionts in ericoid mycorrhizas (Smith & Read, 1997), is suggestive of active nutrient 373 \nexchange between C. varians and R. ericae. However, whether or not C. varians benefits from the 374 \n 16 \nwell-documented saprotrophic capability of R. ericae, one of the major benefits imparted to plants 375 \nforming ericoid mycorrhizas with the fungus (Smith & Read, 1997), is at present an open question. 376 \nDespite the fact that certain features of the association are suggestive of a role in the growth and 377 \nsurvival of the liverwort, the functional nature of the C. varians-R. ericae association remains 378 \nunclear and should be a focus for future studies. Nevertheless, we can broadly conclude from the 379 \ncurrent study that there appears to be a widespread and consistent association between the liverwort 380 \nand R. ericae in the maritime and sub-Antarctic, and that R. ericae is at least in part responsible for 381 \nthe formation of the coils observed in the rhizoids of field-collected C. varians in previous studies. 382 \n 383 \nAcknowledgements 384 \nThanks are due to Blair Lawley, David Pearce, Paul Bridge, Melody Clark and Elaine Fitzcharles 385 \nfor their guidance with molecular work.
