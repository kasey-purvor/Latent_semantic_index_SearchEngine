Dreiner1 and Ulrich Nierste2\n1 Physikalisches Institut, Universita\u00a8t Bonn, Nu\u00dfallee 12, D-53115 Bonn, Germany\n2 CERN, TH Division, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland\nWe analyse the rare decay mode Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 in the minimal supergravity scenario (mSUGRA). We\nfind a strong correlation with the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g \u2212 2)\u00b5. An interpretation\nof the recently measured excess in (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 in terms of mSUGRA corrections implies a substantial\nsupersymmetric enhancement of the branching ratio B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212): if (g\u22122)\u00b5 exceeds the Standard\nModel prediction by 4 \u00b7 10\u22129, B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) is larger by a factor of 10\u2013100 than in the Standard\nModel and within reach of Run-II of the Tevatron. Thus an experimental search for Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212\nis a stringent test of the mSUGRA GUT scale boundary conditions. If the decay Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 is\nobserved at Run-II of the Tevatron, then we predict the mass of the lightest supersymmetric Higgs\nboson to be less than 120 GeV. The decay Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 can also significantly probe the favoured\nparameter range in SO(10) SUSY GUT models.\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) is an attractive and widely\nstudied extension of the Standard Model (SM). The min-\nimal supergravity model (mSUGRA) [1] relates all su-\npersymmetric parameters to just 5 real quantities: the\nuniversal scalar and gaugino masses M0 and M1\/2, the\ntrilinear term A0, the ratio tan\u03b2 of the two Higgs vac-\nuum expectation values, and sgn\u00b5, where \u00b5 is the Higgs-\nino mass parameter. The first three quantities are de-\nfined at a high, grand unified energy scale and the others\nat the electroweak scale. They are the boundary con-\nditions for the renormalization group equations, which\ndetermine the physical parameters at our low scale. Pre-\ncision observables, which are affected by SUSY correc-\ntions through loop effects, play an important role in\nconstraining the supersymmetric parameter space. The\nsmall number of parameters makes mSUGRA highly pre-\ndictive so it can be significantly tested by low energy\nprecision measurements. In this letter we show that the\ndecay Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 is a stringent test of the mSUGRA\nscenario, in particular when correlated with (g \u2212 2)\u00b5.\nRecently the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)\nreported an excess of the muon anomalous magnetic mo-\nment a\u00b5 = (g \u2212 2)\u00b5\/2 over its SM value [2]. The differ-\nence \u03b4a\u00b5 = a\nexp\n\u00b5 \u2212a\nSM\n\u00b5 = (43\u00b116) \u00b710\n\u221210 corresponds to\na 2.6\u03c3 deviation from the SM. An mSUGRA interpreta-\ntion of this anomaly implies \u00b5 > 0 (in the sign convention\nwith M1\/2 > 0 and equal signs of the diagonal elements\nof the chargino mass matrix) [3]. It further invites a\nlarge tan\u03b2 >\u223c 10 [4]. The discrepancy in the case of a\u00b5\nis by itself not significant enough to justify the claim\nof new physics, especially since the calculation of aSM\u00b5\ninvolves two hadronic quantities: the hadronic contribu-\ntions to the photon self-energy, which must be obtained\nfrom other experiments, and the (smaller) light-by-light\nscattering contribution, which can only be estimated with\nhadronic models. A more conservative estimate of the\nlatter would reduce the BNL anomaly to a 2\u03c3 effect [2].\nHence in order to resolve the possible ambiguity between\nmSUGRA and alternative explanations of \u03b4a\u00b5 one ideally\nwishes to study other observables whose sensitivity to su-\npersymmetric loop corrections is correlated with \u03b4a\u00b5. It\nis our purpose here to show the strong correlation be-\ntween B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) and \u03b4a\u00b5 in mSUGRA.\nSUSY modifies B meson observables if tan\u03b2 is large,\nbecause the b Yukawa coupling becomes sizable. Espe-\ncially sensitive are quantities with a b quark chirality flip\nlike the branching ratios B(B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) and B(B \u2192 \u2113\n+\u2113\u2212).\nIn mSUGRA the low energy value for the trilinear term\nAt is dominated by M1\/2 with At < 0 for M1\/2 > 0 [5].\nThen \u00b5 > 0 implies that the charged-Higgs-top loop and\nthe chargino-stop loop tend to cancel in B(B \u2192 Xs\u03b3), so\nthat the sensitivity to mSUGRA corrections is weakened.\nA further disadvantage of this decay mode is that it re-\nquires an experimental cut on the photon energy, which\nintroduces some hadronic uncertainty.\nIn [5] the possible impact of flavour-blind SUSY on\nother B physics observables, in particular those which en-\nter the fit of the unitarity triangle, were studied and only\nsmall effects were found. This did not include the decay\nBs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212. In contrast to the observables in [5], the\nbranching ratio B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) grows like tan6 \u03b2 [6\u20138],\nwith a possible several orders of magnitude enhancement.\nWe here go beyond this work to study Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 in\nthe mSUGRA model. Since B(B \u2192 \u2113+\u2113\u2212) \u221d m2\u2113 , the\nbranching ratio is largest for \u2113 = \u03c4 . Yet \u03c4 \u2019s are hard to\ndetect at hadron colliders, so that the prime experimen-\ntal focus is on the search for Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212. B factories\nrunning on the \u03a5(4S) resonance produce no Bs mesons.\nLeptonic branching ratios of Bd mesons are smaller by a\nfactor of |Vtd\/Vts|\n2 <\n\u223c 0.06. Since in B factories the boost\nof the Bd meson is known and the considered leptonic\ndecay rates can be substantially enhanced over their SM\nvalues in SUSY, we encourage our colleagues at BaBar\nand BELLE to look for Bd \u2192 \u03c4\n+\u03c4\u2212 decays, as well.\nFrom now on we restrict ourselves to the decay mode\nBs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212.\nIn [6\u20138] the SUSY corrections to B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) were\ncalculated at the one-loop level. For large tan\u03b2, higher\norder corrections can be large, eventually of order 1.\nIn [9] tan\u03b2-enhanced supersymmetric QCD corrections\n1\nhave been summed to all orders in perturbation the-\nory. We have incorporated these dominant higher or-\nder corrections by replacing the b Yukawa coupling hb \u221d\nmb tan\u03b2 with h\neff\nb = hb\/(1+\u2206mb), where \u2206mb \u221d \u00b5 tan\u03b2\ndepends on the gluino and sbottom masses and can be\nfound in [9]. \u2206mb is positive for \u00b5 > 0. The dominant\ncontribution to B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) is proportional to heff 4b ,\nso that the inclusion of \u2206mb tempers the large-tan\u03b2 be-\nhaviour.\nThe considered branching ratio can be expressed as\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) =\n6.0 \u00b7 10\u22127\n(\n|Vts|\n0.040\n)2(\nfBs\n230MeV\n)2 m2\u00b5\nm2Bs\n\u221a\n1\u2212\n4m2\u00b5\nm2Bs{(\n1\u2212\n4m2\u00b5\nM2Bs\n) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223m2BsCSm\u00b5\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n+\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223m2BsCPm\u00b5 \u2212 2CA\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n}\n. (1)\nHere |Vts| = 0.040 \u00b1 0.002 is the relevant CKM ma-\ntrix element and fBs = (230 \u00b1 30) MeV [10] is the\nBs decay constant. In (1) we have kept the depen-\ndence on the lepton mass m\u00b5, so that the generalisa-\ntion to Bd \u2192 \u03c4\n+\u03c4\u2212 is straightforward. The Wilson\ncoefficients CS , CP and CA, which contain the short-\ndistance physics, are normalised as in [11]. The co-\nefficients cS , cP and c10 defined in [8] are related to\nours by CS = \u22122cS sin\n2 \u03b8W , CA = \u22122c10 sin\n2 \u03b8W and\nCP = 2cP sin\n2 \u03b8W . Within the SM, CS and CP are\nnegligibly small and the NLO result for CA can be\nwell approximated by CA = 2.01(mt\/167 GeV)\n1.55 [12].\nHere mt \u2261 mt(mt) is the top quark mass in the MS\nscheme. mt = 167 GeV corresponds to a pole mass\nof mt = 175 GeV. The SM prediction is given by\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) = (3.7 \u00b1 1.2) \u00b7 10\u22129, with the uncer-\ntainty (\u00b125%) dominated by fBs . This is also the main\nhadronic uncertainty in the SUSY calculation.\nDuring Run-I of the Tevatron, CDF determined [13]\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) < 2.6\u00d7 10\u22126, at 95% C.L. (2)\nThe single event sensitivity of CDF at Run-IIa is es-\ntimated to be 1.0 \u00b7 10\u22128, for an integrated luminosity\nof 2 fb\u22121 [14]. Thus if mSUGRA corrections enhance\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) to e.g. 5 \u00b7 10\u22127, one will see 50 events\nin Run-IIa. Run-IIb may collect 10-20 fb\u22121 of integrated\nluminosity, which implies 250-500 events in this example.\nIn SUSY, the dominant coefficients are CS,P since\nthey are proportional to tan3 \u03b2. We would like to un-\nderstand the effect of the restricted mSUGRA param-\neters on CS,P and thus on B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212). In\nmSUGRA the low-energy values of both \u00b5 and the\nsquark masses are dominated by the (GUT scale) value\nof M1\/2 through the renormalization group equations.\nFor not-too-large M0,M1\/2 <\u223c 500 GeV and A0 \u2243 0\nGeV we can derive the approximate formula B(Bs \u2192\n\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) \u2248 10\u22126 tan6 \u03b2M2\n1\/2GeV\n4\/(M2\n1\/2 +M\n2\n0 )\n3. In the\nvicinity of the maximum (near M1\/2 = 0.4M0) the\napproximate formula is not accurate. A similar esti-\nmate of the supersymmetric contribution to a\u00b5 yields\n(\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY \u221d tan\u03b2f(M0)\/M\n2\n1\/2. (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY depends on\nslepton masses, which are less sensitive to M1\/2 than\nsquark masses; they are dominated by M0. We have en-\ncoded the M0 dependence in the slowly varying function\nf(M0). Hence both B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) and (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY\ngrow with tan\u03b2 and decrease with increasing M1\/2. For\nthis it is essential that we have made the assumption\nof the mSUGRA GUT scale boundary conditions. Thus\nwithin mSUGRA we expect a strong correlation between\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) and (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY : if \u03b4a\u00b5 6= 0 requires a\nSUSY explanation with large tan\u03b2 then we would expect\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) to be strongly enhanced. If, however, the\nsupersymmetric explanation of \u03b4a\u00b5 requires small M1\/2\nand a moderate value of tan\u03b2 then we would expect only\na moderate enhancement of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212).\nFIG. 1. (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY , versus B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) for tan \u03b2 (top)\nand M1\/2=450, M0 = 350, A0 = 0, \u00b5 > 0, mt = 175\nGeV. Shown also, the SM prediction, the present bound by\nCDF [13], on B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) as well as the present 1\u03c3 and\n2\u03c3 bound on \u03b4a\u00b5 from BNL [2]. We used fBs = 230 MeV.\nWe now study these effects quantitatively. For this\nwe use the full computation of Eq.(1) including the re-\nsummed SUSY QCD corrections, and restricting our-\nselves to the mSUGRA parameters. In Fig.1, we\nshow the direct correlation between B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212)\nand (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY for the fixed parameters: M1\/2 =\n450 GeV,M0 = 350 GeV, A0 = 0, \u00b5 > 0 and mt = 175\nGeV. On the upper edge we show the tan\u03b2 dependence.\nWe restrict ourselves to tan\u03b2 < 58 in order to guarantee\nradiative electroweak symmetry breaking (REWSB). We\nhave included the SM prediction and the CDF bound\nfrom Eq.(2). The solid (dashed) curve represents the\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) result with (without) resummation of\nthe tan\u03b2-enhanced SUSY-QCD corrections. In this ex-\n2\nample, the resummation suppresses B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) by\n75% for tan\u03b2 >\u223c 50. In order for mSUGRA to account\nfor \u03b4a\u00b5 within 1\u03c3 of the current BNL measurement at\nthis parameter point, we see that we need a large value\nof tan\u03b2 >\u223c 50. Due to the strong correlation within\nmSUGRA we then predict B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) >\u223c 5 \u00b7 10\n\u22128,\nwhich is observable by CDF at Run II.\nFIG. 2. Contours of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) (solid) and (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY\n(in units 10\u221210) (dashed) in the M1\/2-tan\u03b2 plane. The light-\nest neutral CP-even Higgs mass is shown as well (dot-dashed).\nThe shaded regions are excluded, as described in the text.\nThe mSUGRA parameters are given at the top.\nFIG. 3.

The shaded regions are excluded\nas described in the text. Contours of the light Higgs boson\nmass (dot-dash line) are also shown.\nAs we discussed above, we expect B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) to\ndominantly depend on the mSUGRA parameters M1\/2\nand tan\u03b2. In Fig.2 we show the B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) (solid)\nand the (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY (dashed) contours in this plane. We\nhave fixed: M0 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0, \u00b5 > 0 and\nmt = 175 GeV. The 2\u03c3 contours for \u03b4a\u00b5 (11,75) are\nexplicitly given. The left vertical shaded region is the-\noretically excluded since it does not allow for REWSB\nor violates the LEP chargino bound. The upper right\ntriangular shaded region is excluded, since the LSP is\nnot neutral. If as expected, CDF can probe down to\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) >\u223c 2\u00b710\n\u22127 at RUN IIa, this corresponds to\na sensitivity of (M1\/2, tan\u03b2) ranging from (160GeV, 47)\nto (450GeV, 57). The qualitative discussion of before\nis now nicely reproduced. B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) decreases\nwith increasing M1\/2 and rapidly increases with tan\u03b2.\nFig.2 also nicely shows the cross-correlation between\n(\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY and B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212). If both B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212)\nand (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY are found in disagreement with the SM\nand are measured with a 50% and 20% accuracy, respec-\ntively, then for given M0, this fixes tan\u03b2 to better than\n20% and M1\/2 to better than 30%.\nIt is conventional to discuss mSUGRA physics in\nthe (M1\/2,M0)-plane. In Fig.3 we show the contours\nof B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) (solid) and (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY (dashed) in\nthis plane, for tan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = 0, \u00b5 > 0 and\nmt = 175GeV. Again we include the CDF bound\nEq.(2) and the Higgs mass contours. The left shaded\nregion is excluded through the requirement of REWSB\nor the chargino bound. The lower right shaded re-\ngion is excluded through the requirement of a neutral\nLSP. A sensitivity of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) >\u223c 2 \u00b7 10\n\u22127 at CDF\nnow corresponds to a sensitivity of M1\/2 <\u223c 280GeV and\nM0 <\u223c 400GeV, respectively.\nWhile CDF is not able to see squark masses directly up\nto 0.7 TeV (corresponding to M1\/2 = M0 \u2243 300 GeV,),\nit will nevertheless be able to prepare the ground for\nLHC by observing the Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212 mode. Even bet-\nter, after 10 fb\u22121 CDF will probe M1\/2 <\u223c 450 GeV and\nM0 <\u223c 600GeV (for tan\u03b2 = 50) which in mSUGRA cor-\nresponds to masses for the heaviest superpartners of 1\nTeV. We conclude the discussion of Fig.3 with the pre-\ndiction of the light Higgs boson mass Mh (dot-dashed\nline) for tan\u03b2 = 50 in the mSUGRA scenario [15]. Any\nmeasurement of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) by itself implies a use-\nful upper bound on Mh. The simultaneous information\nof B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) and \u03b4a\u00b5 fixes Mh in most regions of\nthe (M1\/2,M0)-plane. A Higgs mass around 115.6 GeV\nresults in 10\u22128 <\u223c B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) <\u223c 3 \u00b710\n\u22127 which would\nmost likely be measured before the Higgs boson is dis-\ncovered.\nIn Figs. 1-3 we have chosen A0 = 0. A non-zero A0\nchanges the value of At at low energies. This parame-\nter plays a crucial role for the GIM cancellations among\nthe contributions of different squarks to B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212).\nChanging A0 to \u2212500GeV in the scenario of Fig. 1 en-\nhances B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) by up to a factor of 6 com-\npared to the case with A0 = 0. For A0 = +500 GeV\nB(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) is slightly decreased.\n3\nIn our figures we have omitted further constraints on\nthe mSUGRA parameter space, in order to clearly show\nthe correlation between B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) and (\u03b4a\u00b5)SUSY .\nThe most significant further constraint comes from the\nmeasurement of B(B \u2192 Xs\u03b3) [16], whose prediction is\nless certain in the large tan\u03b2 region [17,5]. If we take\nthe conservative approach of [18], then we can exclude\nvalues of M1\/2 <\u223c 250GeV in Fig.2 for tan\u03b2\n>\n\u223c 25. In the\nscenario of Fig.3 this implies B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) <\u223c 5 \u00b7 10\n\u22127.\nFor a discussion of the constraints from supersymmetric\ndark matter see for example [4,18] and references therein.\nThe large values of tan\u03b2 we have been considering\nare theoretically well motivated within SUSY SO(10)\nYukawa unification. There a narrow parameter region can\nexplain the observed \u03b4a\u00b5 while still being consistent with\nthe constraint from b\u2192 s\u03b3 [19,20]. This is not within the\ncontext of mSUGRA. However, in this parameter region\nboth \u00b5 andM1\/2 are light, while the CP-odd Higgs boson\nmass is less than 300 GeV, and tan\u03b2 \u2248 50. Therefore\nwe expect B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) to be strongly enhanced. As\nan example we determine B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) for the best fit\npoints found in [20]: MA = 110 GeV, m\u03c7\u02dc1\n<\n\u223c 250 GeV,\n|At| >\u223c 1 TeV, mt\u02dc\n<\n\u223c 1 TeV and tan\u03b2 \u2243 50. Within the\nhadronic uncertainties B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) >\u223c 10\n\u22125 which is\nalready excluded by CDF [13]. Thus the SO(10) models\nshould be reconsidered in the light of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212).\nTurning it around, if an SO(10) GUT model is the cor-\nrect description of nature then the decay Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212\nmust be just around the corner.\nIn conclusion, we have found a striking correlation be-\ntween the muon anomalous magnetic moment a\u00b5 and the\nbranching ratio B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) in mSUGRA scenarios.\nIf the reported excess in a\u00b5 [2] is caused by mSUGRA\ncorrections with large tan\u03b2, one faces more than an or-\nder of magnitude enhancement of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) over its\nSM value. This is within reach of Run-II of the Tevatron.\nThe combined measurements significantly constrain the\nmSUGRA parameters, allowing a determination of tan\u03b2\nandM1\/2. A measurement of B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212) will further\nconstrain the mass of the lightest Higgs bosons. SO(10)\nSUSY explanations of the measured a\u00b5 are barely com-\npatible with the present upper bound on B(Bs \u2192 \u00b5\n+\u00b5\u2212).\nWe thank B. Dutta, G. Isidori, K.
