Introduction\nAlthough the first reported cases of mycotoxicoses was in 1722, not until 1960 was \nthere significant research into the causes of mycotoxicoses with the onset of \u2018turkey \nX\u2019 disease (Farrer, 1987). At that time the mould Aspergillus flavus was isolated and \ncorrelated with aflatoxin production. Although A. flavus can grow in range of \ntemperatures (10oC - 45oC), the optimum temperature is 30oC. Additionally a relative \nhumidity of 80% is required hence aflatoxin contamination is more of a concern in \nhumid tropics regions (Moreau, 1979). It was also recognised that ruminants upon the \nconsumption of aflatoxin B1 contaminated feed would excrete aflatoxin M1 through \nmilk (Sargeant, 1961; Holzapfel & Steyn, 1966). Subsequently it has been shown that \nalfatoxin B1 can also be produced to a lesser extent by A. parasiticus. It has been \npostulated that aflatoxin M1 is a detoxification product of aflatoxin B1 since the \ncarcinogenicity of aflatoxin M1 is lower than aflatoxin B1 (Neal et al., 1998). \nHowever, aflatoxin M1 is still regarded as; carcinogenic, genotoxic, teratogenic and \nimmunosuppressive compound.  Reports have hypothesised that the excretion of \naflatoxin M1 is between 1 to 4% of the amount of ingested aflatoxin B1 for cows milk \n(van Egmond, 1983).\nAlfatoxin M1 can be found in dairy based products such as cheese, yogurt and infant \nformulae (van Egmond, 1983; Sharman et al., 1989; Martins and Martins, 2002), and \nalso in human breast milk and acts as a good biomarker, (El-Nezami et al., 1995). \nDue to the fact that milk intake in infants is high and when young they are vulnerable \nto toxins, the European Commission regulation 472\/2002 imposes maximum \npermissible levels of aflatoxin M1 in milk of 50 ng l\n-1 and 25 ng l-1 for infant formulae \n(Henry et al., 2001; Gilbert and Vargas, 2003). Austria and Switzerland have imposed \nstricter limits of 10 ng l-1 whereas the USA have higher regulatory of 500 ng l-1. \nAlthough most concerning is many underdeveloped countries do not impose aflatoxin \nM1 restrictions. \nThe official methods of analysis for aflatoxin M1 rely upon high performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Sydenham and \nShephard, 1996) with sample extraction and clean up conducted before the analysis. \nImmunochemical techniques are becoming very popular for mycotoxins analysis with \nPage 4 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nmany literature reporting the use of either a commercially developed enzyme linked \nimmunosorbant assay (ELISA) or self developed immunoassays (El-Nezami, 1995; \nThirumala-Devi, 2002; Lopez et al., 2003; Rodriguez Velasco et al., 2003; Rastogi et \nal., 2004; Sarimehmetoglu et al., 2004; Logrieco et al., 2004). Additionally liquid \nchromatography- mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (S\u00f8rensen and Elb\u00e6k, 2005) has also \nbeen employed. All of these methods are slow and most are performed in laboratory \nsettings and by qualified personnel. Unfortunately the regions of the world which are \nmost affected by aflatoxin contamination tends to be poorer areas with minimal \nlaboratory facilities. In India, for example, a recent survey found that 87.3% of the \nmilk based samples analysed were contaminated, of these 99% were outside European \nlimits.  This is a major concern considering that India is the largest producer of milk \nin the world (Rastogi et al., 2004). Therefore as stipulated by the united nations \u2018there \nis an urgent need for simple, robust, low-cost analysis methods, for the major \nmycotoxins, which can be used in developing countries laboratories\u2019 (Proctor, 1994). \nFurthermore the United Nations are quoted saying that \u2018the systematic and complete \nmonitoring of aflatoxin is a major challenge for the future, as food production \nincreases (Stroka and Anklam, 2002). \nIn this paper we present a cost effective, disposable immunosensor for the detection of \naflatoxin M1 which can be preformed in the field to meet the detection requirements \nset out by the European Union and fulfilling the requirements quoted by the United \nNations. Primarily, the two main enzyme substrates used for immunosensors are \nalkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase. Volpe et al. (1998) has reported that \nusing 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019- tetramethylbenzidine, (TMB) as an enzyme substrate for horseradish \nperoxidase yield greater sensitivity than substrates for alkaline phosphatase. \nFurthermore with the designed immunosensor to be used in raw milk, naturally \npresent alkaline phosphatase potentially may cause interference. Using TMB as a \nsubstrate is re-enforced by Fanjul Bolado et al. (2005) who reported that TMB out \nperforms 2,2\u2019-azino-bis-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and o-\nphenylenediamine (OPD), furthermore OPD and ABTS have shown to be mutagenic \nand carcinogenic (Voogd et al., 1980).\nThe oxidation of TMB is a two step reaction. Firstly the addition of hydrogen \nperoxide to heme group containing HRP enzyme, reduces the HRP to form an \nPage 5 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nintermediate (compound 1), involving a 2 electron process, by changing the heme \n(Fe3+) group into a ferryl oxo iron (Fe4+=O) and a porphyrin (P) cation radical. Upon \nthe addition of TMB, 2 molecules of TMB are oxidised by compound 1 to form a blue \ncoloured electrochemical product. Upon the release of H2O the peroxidase returns to \nthe native state via a further intermediate, leaving the TMB in an oxidized state. \nCommonly sulphuric acid is added to the oxidised TMB to develop a stable yellow \ndiiamine product that is measured at 450 nm and can be measured by differential \npulsed voltammetry (Josephy et al., 1982; Ruzgas et al., 1996; Frey et al., 2000; \nTanaka et al., 2003). \nIn this work we report the development of a screen- printed electrode immunosensor, \nbased on a competitive reaction between the free aflatoxin M1 in the sample and an \naflatoxin M1 \u2013 horseradish peroxidase conjugate, for an immobilised monoclonal \nantibody for aflatoxin M1. Using chronoamperometry, the signal generated by the use \nof TMB \/ H2O2 was monitored to ascertain the concentration of HRP on the sensor \nand consequently the concentration of aflatoxin M1 in the sample. The immunosensor \nwas optimised with regard interferences from the milk matrix. The simple method of \nmilk sample pre-treatment which was developed in this work and combined with the \noptimised sensor is novel and being reported for the first time in this application.  \n2. Material and methods\n2.1 Reagents and solutions\nAflatoxin M1 was purchased from Axxora UK Limited (Nottingham, UK), Anti-\naflatoxin M1 antibody (raised from rat) from Abcam Limited, (Cambridge UK), \nAflatoxin M1-HRP conjugate from a RIDASCREEN\n\uf0e2 kit from R-Biopharm \n(Glasgow, UK) as well as Alfaprep\uf0e2 M immunoaffinity columns. 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-\nTetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride, hydrogen peroxide, fish skin gelatine, \npolyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone and Tween 20 purchased from Sigma-\nAldrich (Poole, UK). Anti-Rat immunopure antibody (raised in goat with affinity for \nthe Fc fragment only) was from Perbio Science (Cramlington, UK). Milinex sheets \nfrom Cadillac plastics (Swindon, UK), Electrodag 423-SS graphite ink, Electrodag \n6038-SS Ag\/AgCl from Acheson industries (Plymouth, UK), Blue epoxy insulating \nPage 6 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nink 242-SB, from ESL electroscience products (Reading, UK), Milk and dried milk \nsamples were obtained from the local supermarket. \n2.2 Electrodes Fabrication \nScreen- printed electrodes (SPEs) were fabricated in house by a multistage deposition \nprocess using a DEK 248-screen printer and stencils (DEK, Weymouth, UK) (Kadara \nand Tothill, 2004). The electrodes were printed using 250 \u03bcm thick polyester Melinex \nsheets. The print parameters were set so that the squeegee pressure was 4 psi, a \ncarriage speed of 50 mm sec-1 and a print gap of 2.5 mm. For the fabrication, the basal \ntracks for the three-electrode system were printed first using Electrodag 423-SS \ngraphite ink. The reference electrode was printed on one of the basal tracks using \nElectrodag 6038-SS silver-sliver chloride ink and left to dry. The two other tracks \n(graphite-carbon working electrode with a 5 mm diameter giving a 19.6 mm2 planar \narea and a graphite carbon counter electrode (1.3 mm2 planar area).  The blue epoxy \ninsulating layer was printed last using 242-SB protective polymer. Between each layer \nthe sheets were allowed to dry for 2 hours at 60oC and then after the insulating layer \nthe sheets were cured at 120oC for two hours.  The different inks used and the \npolyester sheet used in the sensor fabrications are stable at this temperature.\n2.3 Procedures\nElectrochemical  measurements\nFor the electrochemical procedures a computer controlled four channel Autolab \nelectrochemical analyser multipotentiostat (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) \nwas used throughout which allows the simultaneous detection of four sensors. Data \ncapture was through the supplied GPES version 4.9 software installed onto a PC. The \nscreen-printed ele trodes were connected to the Autolab, using an in house fabricated \nconnector from a PCB edged IDC socket, aluminum instrument box, ribbon cable and \n4 mm cable sockets. The individual components were purchased from Maplin \nElectronics (Milton Keynes, UK).  For the C.V. scans a 100 \uf06dl of sample drop was \nplaced onto the electrode and was disposed of after each scan. The scanning range \nwas from -1 to +1 V at a rate of  99.78 mV\/s with steps of 2.74 mV. Studies into the \nsuppression effects of milk used samples of milk with different pre-treatments mixed \nwith 5 mM potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) in 0.1 M KCl.  \nPage 7 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nImmunoassay developments\nFor the sensor construction, 8 \uf06dl of 0.12 mg ml-1 anti-primary antibody in 0.1 M  \ncarbonate buffer pH 9.6 was placed onto the working graphite electrode, placed into a \nhumid environment (stored overnight at 4oC), to allow passive adsorption of the \nantibody onto the carbon surface.  The sensor was then washed with 0.05 % Tween 20 \nin 10 mM PBS buffer and 18.0 M\u03a9 water. The electrodes were then shaken to remove \nmost of the surplus water and anti-aflatoxin M1 monoclonal antibody at 0.04 mg ml\n-1\n(8 \uf06dl) in 10 mM PBS buffer was added and incubated for 2 h at 37oC, in a humid \nenvironment. The surface of the sensor was then blocked by immersed in 1 % PVA in \nPBS to cover the working, reference and auxiliary electrodes for 2 h at 37oC. The \nsensor was then washed and stored at 4 oC until used.  \nAflatoxin M1 standards were prepared by dissolving the aflatoxin M1 powder in \nmethanol at a concentration of 10 mg ml-1 to prepare a stock solution and then stored \nat \u201318 oC. Working standard solutions (between 5 and 1000 ng l-1) were prepared by \ndiluting the stock with 1% methanol in 20 mM Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (CaCl2 concentration \nof 18 mM) pH 7.4, into twice the desired concentration and then mixing 500 \u00b5l of \nstandard with 500\u00b5l of commercial milk. Milk samples were also pre-treated by \nadding 25 ml of 20 mM Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (CaCl2 concentration of 18 mM) pH 7.4, in \n1% methanol to 25 ml of milk sample and mixing. This was carried out using a vortex \nmixer.\nFor the competitive reaction a 4 \uf06dl of aflatoxin M1 standard or sample was diluted in \nPBS buffer with 1% methanol, and placed onto the working electrode with 4 \uf06dl of \n1:10 dilution of the aflatoxin M1-HRP conjugate from the RIDASCREEN\n\uf0e2 kit diluted \nusing 1% PVA in PBS.  No specific sampling protocols were implemented for milk \nsampling since milk is considered homogeneous (van Egmond, 1983).\nThe competitive reaction between the free aflatoxin M1 and the aflatoxin M1 \u2013 HRP \nwas performed at 37oC for 2 hours. The sensor was again washed, shaken to almost \ndryness, then 100 \uf06dl of 5 mM 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and 1 mM \nhydrogen peroxide in citrate buffer containing 0.1 M KCl, was added to the sensor \nPage 8 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nensuring all three electrodes were covered. The Autolab running in \nchronoamperometry mode was started and the data collected for 20 minutes. For the \nchronoamperometry data points were collected every 2 seconds at a potential of either \n-100 mV or +100 mV. For electrode preconditioning a conditioning potential of +200 \nmV was applied for 20 seconds followed by an equilibrium time of 5 seconds before \ndata was collected at +100 mV. \nStep amperometry was performed by adding 10 units of horseradish peroxidase, to a \nsolution of 5 mM TMB and 1 mM hydrogen peroxide in 0.1M KCl citrate buffer, then \nincubating for 30 minutes before measurement. A blank signal was obtained without \nthe addition of peroxidase. The Autolab was set for steps of 100 mV from 0 mV to \neither -900 or +900 mV and current measurement for 100 seconds.\nFor the fractionation of the casein and whey proteins of milk, a similar method to that \ndescribed by Vernozy-Rozand et al., (2004) was implemented. Firstly a commercial \nwhole fat milk sample was initially centrifuged at 9600 x g to remove the cream and \nfatty layers. The supernatant was decanted and adjusted to pH 4.6 with the use of 4 M \nhydrochloric acid, stirred for 30 minutes and then centrifuged again to obtain casein \nfree liquor. For the removal of whey proteins the supernatant was treated with 5 M \ntrichloroacetic acid and stirred for 30 minutes before centrifugation. The remaining \nliquor was free from proteins. \nCalculations of limits of detection for the immunosensor was determined as described \nby Ammidia et al., (2004) and Draisci et al., (2001) as the amount of aflatoxin M1\nrequired to reduce the signal change by 25%.\n2.4 HPLC Analysis\nThe in-house HPLC determination was performed using a Waters 600E System \nController, a Waters 712 WISP Autosampler and a Waters 470 Scanning \nFluorescence Detector set at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission \nwavelength of 430 nm. The Waters modules were computer controlled using \nKromasystem 2000 software. A Phenomenex Luna 5u C18 analytical column was \nused throughout with a security guard TM guard column. Aflatoxin M1 standards \nwere made up with 1% methanol, 49% of 20 mM, pH 7.4, PBS buffer and 50% milk \nPage 9 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nsample. The toxin was then extracted from the milk samples using Alfaprep\uf0e2\nimmunoaffinity columns as denoted by the manufactures R-Biopharm. Briefly 50 ml \nof spiked milk was centrifuged at 3,000 RPM to isolate the fat and then passed \nthrough the immunoaffinity column at a rate of 1-2 drops per second. The column was \nwashed with 2 aliquots of 10 ml H2O and eluted into a eppendorf tube with 1.25 ml of \n2:3 methanol:acetonitrile followed by 1.25 ml of H2O. After mixing by vortex, the \nsample was divided into three and placed into HPLC vials for triplicate analysis. \n2.5 Safety awareness\nAll laboratory glassware and consumables which had been contaminated with \naflatoxin M1 was stored overnight in 5% sodium hypochlorite followed by the \naddition of acetone to make the solution 5% acetone by volume. The decontamination \nsolution was allowed a minimum of 30 minutes before disposal.  \n3. Results and Discussions\n3.1 Optimisation of the immunosensor\nFor the immunosensor developments TMB was chosen as the mediator for the \nenzyme label, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity determination. Previous work at \nCranfield has been preformed using hydroquinone and o-phenylenediamine (OPD) as \nthe mediators for hydrogen peroxide (Baskeyfield, 2001). The application for the \nsensor is for point of source monitoring in field work, therefore the use of \ncarcinogenic compounds is not preferable. Furthermore TMB has superior detection \nproperties than other systems (Fanjul-Bolado et al., 2005, Volpe et al., 1998) .The \ninitial protocol for the immunosensor development was adopted from Micheli et al. \n(2005). However, it was noticed that there are discrepancies in the literature into the \noptimum potential for the electrochemical detection of TMB using carbon electrodes. \nMicheli et al., (2005) reported the detection of TMB at -100mV versus Ag\/AgCl, \nwhereas Butler et al., (2006), Fanjul-Bolado et al., (2005) and Volpe et al., (1998) \nsuggest a voltage at +100mV versus Ag\/AgCl. Since no previous literature reports \ncould be found where the preferential potential had been discussed, step amerometry \nwas performed to elucidate the correct potential for the developed immunosensor.\nPage 10 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nTherefore a range of potentials from -900 mV to +900 mV were investigated using \nthe developed screen-printed electrode. Figure 1, show that the best potential for \nmonitoring the reduction was -100 mV and for the oxidation +100 mV. This is \nharmonious with the previous reported observations.\nFigure 1\nThe step amperometry suggested that +100 mV would yield stronger signal to blank \nratio than -100 mV. An additional experiment was preformed to validate this \nobservation. Figure 2a, show that although the reduction signal gave a greater signal \nthan the oxidation signal, it incurred a high blank signal, hence for the development of \nthe sensor the oxidation signal was monitored. The use of electrochemical \npreconditioning of the electrode for immunosensor development has been reported \nrecently (Conneely et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2006). Therefore, to maximize the signal, \nthe use of electrode pre-conditioning was investigated in this work. To precondition \nthe electrode a conditioning potential of +200 mV was applied for 20 seconds before \ndetection of TMB at +100 mV. Figure 2b shows that although there is little advantage \nwith respect to the background levels, there is significant gain in signal by pre-\nconditioning the sensor before data collection. Further electrode treatment was \ninvestigated to depolarise the electrode surface before antibody immobilization\n(Grennan et al., 2000; Espinosa et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1996). Summarising the \nliterature, the use of a potential of 2.0 V from 30 seconds to 10 minutes was applied to \nincrease protein immobilization capacity and electron-transfer rates of the working \nelectrode, in turn increasing the signal and reproducibility. The same treatment was \nperformed for our electrodes to deem if this treatment would increase or produce a \nmore reproducible signal. As shown in Figure 2c, although the depolarisation did \nproduce a greater signal, the difference is marginal. Additionally the cleaning resulted \nin a high standard deviation therefore considering the additional time incurred from \ndepolarisation the electrodes it was deemed that this step was not fundamental to \nincreasing the sensors performance. However, further testing may prove beneficial to \nelucidate this point in future work. The use of different blocking buffers with \ndifferent chemistries was also investigated (Figure 2d). Using the screen- printed \nelectrode, PVA wasfound to be the optimal blocker.  PVPP (Polyvinyl pyrrolidone) \nPage 11 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nwas also tested but yielded a high standard deviation and therefore was not used in \nthis experiment (data not shown). \nFigure 2\nWith the signal ameliorated a calibration curve was performed in pure buffer \nundertaking the factors from the optimisation experiments (Figure 3). The dynamic \nrange from 1 to 10,000 ng l-1 possessed a linear r2 value of 0.95. \nFigure 3\nUpon performing the calibration in a full fat milk sample with no pre-treatment the \ncorrelation between concentration of aflatoxin M1 and current was lost. Previous \nreports from Pemberton et al. (1999) stated that electro-active species can interfere \nwith the detection of progesterone in milk. Mayer et al. (1996) have reported that milk \ncan cause electrode fouling without pre-treatment, but, upon dialysis with 12000-\n19000 molecular size cut off membranes then the matrix effects are removed. A cyclic \nvoltamogram of TMB, with and without the addition of commercial full fat milk, was \ncarried out (data not shown) and the milk suppressed the signal. To establish the cause \nof the interference several chemical clean up strategies were employed, and tested by \nmonitoring the electrochemical quenching effect. To ascertain the effects of fats to the \nsystem a commercial milk sample (pH adjusted to 8.6) was incubated at 37oC for 24 \nhours to activate the natural lipases and thus breaking down the fats into fatty acids \n(Hui, 1993) was used with a second non-fat milk sample (Sigma \u2013 Aldrich). Both \nsamples quenched the electrochemical signal from potassium hexacyanoferrate, \nsuggesting that fats are not the cause of the interference (Figure 4a). \nFigure 4\nMayer et al. (1996), reported that lactose was an interfering compound for their milk \nbased biosensor. Furthermore the electro active nature of lactose is taken advantage of \nas a method of detection using ion chromatography (Hanko and Rohrer, 2000). To \ndetermine the electrochemical effects of lactose, potassium hexacyanoferrate was \nspiked with 4.6% lactose to replicate the natural concentration in milk (Schrimshaw, \nPage 12 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\n1988). Figure 4b, shows that lactose has no quenching effect, this is to be expected\nsince lactose is below the molecular weight which Mayer et al. (1996) reported as \nbeing responsible for electrode fouling.  Milk was then fractionated into a casein free \nsample (Hui, 1993; Walstra, 1984), and a casein and whey protein fraction (Vernozy-\nRozand et al., 2004) as reported in the methods. By isolating the casein proteins, \nsignificant quenching still occurs, however, upon the removal of whey proteins, the \nsignal was not affected (Figure 4c). To confirm this a milk sample was saturated with \nammonium sulphate and stored at 4oC for 48 hours, then centrifuged. The pre-\ntreatment with ammonium sulphate removed all traces of the interference (the induced \npH shift from ammonium acetate is the cause of the sharper peaks) confirming that \nthe electrochemical interference from milk is due to a proteinaceous compound \n(Figure 4d). Whey proteins otherwise known as \u2018milk serum\u2019 proteins are a group \ncontaining; \u03b2-lactoglobulin (18,363 daltons), \u03b1-lactalbumin (14,176 Daltons) and \nbovine serum albumin (66,267 Daltons), additionally the groups also contains \nimmunoglobins and small molecular weight peptides (Walstra 1984). The molecular \nweight of \u03b2-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin and \u03b1-lactalbumin correlates with \nthe reports of Mayer et al., (1996) that the electrode fouling was eradicated by the use \nof dialysis membranes at 12,000 \u2013 19,000 daltons. Furthermore Diaz et al. (1993) \nadvocates the use of dialysis membranes at 8,000 to 15,000 Daltons for the clean-up \nof milk for aflatoxin M1 determination using TLC.  Cosman et al., (2005) reinforces \nthis observation. \nCosman et al. (2005), reported that whey proteins spontaneously adsorbs onto metal \nsurfaces through a variety of different chemistries. It was suspected that \u03b1-lactalbumin \nimmobilization was due to the loss of calcium causing significant disruption to the \nprotein structure and thus denaturation.  From this observation an excess of calcium \nchloride (18mM) was added to the milk sample and also washing buffer during\nimmunosensor analysis. The resultant effect was losing of the suppression and a \ndetection limit of 39 ng l-1 was achieved in milk samples (Figure 5).  The \nconcentration of 18mM CaCl2 was chosen to mimic that suggested by Dulbecco et al. \n(1954) upon the work with the isolation of viruses. The recipe later became known as \nDulbeccos PBS and is a standard buffer used for maintaining the structure of \nmammalian cells.  This CaCl2 concentration has been shown to have no effect on the \nantibodies activity.\nPage 13 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nFigure 5\nThe developed immunosensor method was compared to an in-house HPLC method \ndeveloped for aflatoxin M1 and a commercial ELISA kit for aflatoxin M1 (R-\nBiopharm). Milk samples were prepared using the calcium chloride pre-treatment \nmethod developed in this work and the same sample was then analysed by all three \nmethods. For HPLC analysis, the sample was then extracted using an immunoaffinity \ncolumn. Figure 6, shows the calibration graphs for all three methods.  \nFigure 6\nThe plots in Figure 6 show the success of the immunosensor developed method. \nCompared to the ELISA procedure, the immunosensor has similar limits of detection \nand comparable repeatability although the working range of the immunosensor is far \ngreater than the ELISA method. In comparison the HPLC was more sensitive than the \nimmunosensor with a limit of detection of 10 ng l-1 for the HPLC verses 39 ng l-1 for \nthe immunosensor based on a 3 times signal to noise ratio, but, with similar dynamic \nrange from 10 to 1000 ng l-1 (r2 value of 0.9944). However, the sample used for the \nHPLC analysis had to be first extracted and purified using an immunoaffinity column \nwhich makes the method more complex and expensive. Also the analysis has to be \nconducted under laboratory conditions, while the sensor is portable, simple and cost \neffective and can be used on site.\n.\n4. Conclusions\nIn this work the development of an electrochemical immunosensor for aflatoxin M1 \nanalysis was developed using a disposable screen-printed electrode. After \nimmobilising the immuno-components to the electrode surface and optimising the \nassay format, the effects of milk on the sensor was assessed. It was discovered that the \nmilk matrix causes significant interference, and through chemical fractionation, it was \nnoted that the interference was chiefly resulting from whey proteins. When an excess \nPage 14 of 23\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\nof calcium chloride (18mM) was added to the milk sample, and to the washing buffer, \nthe effect was suppressed and a working calibration down to 39 ng l-1 was obtained \nwith linear detection range up to 1 \u00b5g l-1. Therefore the use of calcium chloride to \nstabilise milk samples on metal electrodes is advised for future immunosensor \ndevelopments.\nThe immunosensor is not solely suitable for milk, but initial investigations have \nshown that it could be employed for aflatoxin M1 determination in urine also to\nmonitor human aflatoxin M1 consumption. Upon comparing the immunosensor to the \nestablished technologies of HPLC and ELISA, the immunosensor was unique in \noffering good sensitivity as well as total portability.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the European Commission for supporting this work (Project FP6-\nIST1 \u2013 508774 \u2013 IP \u201c GOODFOOD: Food safety and quality with microsystems \ntechnology\u201d).  \nReferences\nAmmida, N.H.S., Micheli, L., Palleschi, G., 2004.
