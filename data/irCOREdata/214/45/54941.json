Domestic\nhouseholds alone are responsible for 30% of the UK\u2019s\ntotal energy consumption [7] and, since 1970,\nhousehold energy demands have grown by 32% [16].\nRising energy consumption currently still results in\nincreased CO2 emissions \u2013 hence domestic energy\nconsumption is very much a world problem e.g. [12],\n[20].\nIt is increasingly recognised that interaction design can\nbe exploited to address issues of sustainability, e.g.[2],\n[17], and indeed there has been a good deal of\nprevious work conducted by the HCI community in the\npast decade on persuasive technology in general e.g.\n[13],[11]. However Fogg recently noted that persuasive\ntechnologies very often fail and urged practitioners to\nthink small in terms of initial behaviour change goals\n[10]. Monitoring technologies alone (e.g. energy\nmeters) are often not enough to make meaningful\nchanges in behaviour. This paper draws on work on\npersuasive technologies as well as on the emergent\npopularity of online social networks (OSNs) in order to\naddress concerns over domestic energy consumption.\nBackground\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that energy\nusage falls when people know it is being monitored [1].\nResearch by the environmental psychology community\nhas indeed shown that feedback on energy\nconsumption can achieve behavioural change - though\nit is not necessarily sustained without timely reminders\n[6],[9]. The goal of the work described here,\ntherefore, is not just to effect behavioural change but\nto demonstrate larger reductions in energy\nconsumption through the addition of a social normative\ninfluence [19].\nSmart Meters\nThe Wattson home energy monitor is a standalone\nmonitoring device, see figure 1, which is designed to\nraise awareness of domestic energy consumption by\nmeans of its display and bundled PC software.  It is an\noff the shelf \u2018smart-meter\u2019 technology which takes\nreadings from an electricity meter via a wireless sensor\nand displays the information as real-time energy usage\ndata.\nFacebook\nThe social networking site Facebook now has over 300\nmillion active users [8]. Studies of Facebook have\ndemonstrated that users read other people\u2019s postings,\nplay games, upload comments on photographs and add\nto their own \u2018profile\u2019 many times daily [15]. These sites\nprovide a powerful means of delivering small,\nasynchronous applications to peer groups of likeminded\nreal-world friends in a manageable and pleasant way.\nThere may then be potential in leveraging the engaging\npower of small applications, offering rich social\ninteractive features to help change energy behaviour.\nThis study aimed to address a gap in current work by\nembedding live, continuous energy data into a fully\ninteractive socially-enabled energy application. Using\nthe Facebook Developers Kit (FDK), Wattson devices\nwere linked to Facebook allowing us to investigate\nwhether sharing live energy information between\nfriends might make for further reductions in energy\nconsumption.\nfigure 1. The Wattson energy monitor\nfrom DIY Kyoto\nDesign Process\nFocus groups were conducted with a convenience\nsample of four Facebook users aged between twenty\nthree and thirty eight. There were three males and one\nfemale and all were responsible for paying their energy\nbills in their own homes. Discussions took place in a\ncustom built responsive home on campus at a\nuniversity and helped the participants focus on the\nhome as a design space. An example of one of the\nfocus group designs is illustrated in figure 2.\nEmoticons were a primary design element derived from\nthe focus group, see figure 3, to convey an injunctive\nsocial norm message [19].These communicated either\napproval or disapproval of the householder\u2019s energy\nusage based on UK statistical energy averages. The\nemoticons ranged from good \u2018green smiling\u2019, average\n\u2018orange neutral\u2019 and bad \u2018red sad\u2019.\nMuch of the discussion revolved around the difficulty of\nrelating to the kilowatt as a unit of energy\nmeasurement: \u201cKilowatts, watts, I don\u2019t want to see\nany of that, money yes\u201d. It was generally agreed that\nintroducing a competitive element between friends who\nwere free to opt in or out of the group might help drive\na reduction in consumption.\nImplementation\nFollowing discussions in the focus group the main\ninterface attributes for displaying energy in the Wattsup\napplication would be expressed in Watts and UK \u00a3\nsterling as well as CO2 emissions measured by weight.\nAdditionally, the emoticon graphical representations\nwere selected for displaying alongside their numerical\ncounterpart values for energy and Co2 emissions.\nThree core interfaces were developed to provide an\nengaging user experience: My Energy, Friends and\nRankings. The \u2018My Energy\u2019 interface, as shown in figure\n3, would show a user\u2019s personal energy consumption\nwith a dial visualisation and a seven day history bar\nchart. The \u2018Friends\u2019 interface would display personal\nenergy consumption against selected friends,\nintroducing social sharing of energy information.\nfigure 3. My Energy: Workshop sketches and final design\nThe technical implementation of Wattsup in conjunction\nwith the Wattson energy monitor is shown in figure 4.\nThe diagram illustrates a wireless sensor at the\nhouseholder\u2019s fuse box sending the current energy\nreading to the Wattson display. The display is physically\nconnected to a PC via a USB cable which transmits\nenergy usage data online via desktop software to the\nmyenergyusage.org web service. Using this online\nstorage method the energy data is available to third\nparty applications such as Wattsup using standard XML.\nfigure 2. Example sketch developed in\nthe focus group\nfigure 4. Technical Implementation of the Wattsup System.\nExperimental Method\nAim\nThe aim of the study was to see if energy savings could\nbe increased by the addition of a social element to\nenergy monitoring. To this end, we made a socially\nenabled version of the Wattson energy monitor via\nFacebook. The hypothesis was that less energy would\nbe used whilst the Wattson was socially enabled than\nwhen it was not socially enabled.\nParticipants\nEight households were recruited to trial Wattsup over\n18 days. The lead participant from each household was\nresponsible for paying the electricity bill and was a daily\nuser of the Facebook website. In total the participants\nbelonged to households with 6 couples and 2 families of\nfour, so twenty people in all were involved in this study.\nThe lead participants had all been regular users of\nFacebook for at least one year and were all friends who\nwere on one another\u2019s Facebook friends list.\nDesign\nThe experiment followed a within subjects design [3]\ndue to limitations on participant numbers and available\nenergy monitors with each participant taking part in\ntwo conditions or social modes. In condition A the\nWattsup application was socially enabled, i.e. users\ncould see their friends\u2019 data as well as their own, in\ncondition B the Wattsup application was manipulated so\nthat there were no social features i.e. users could only\nsee their own energy usage. The households were\ndivided into matched groups and the conditions were\ncounter-balanced between the groups to avoid ordering\neffects [3]. Group 1 started in condition A, group 2 in\ncondition B and switched conditions halfway through.\nSemi-structured interview data was taken at the end of\nthe study to help gauge the participant\u2019s experience.\nRESULTS\nThe energy usage, in kWH, in both conditions for each\nhousehold is summarised in figure 5. A Wilcoxon test,\nfor comparing repeated measures of non-parametric\ndata, showed that energy consumption was significantly\nlower when using the socially enabled condition of\nWattsup (Z= -2.1, N=8, p=0.036).\nA total of 130kWH units of energy were saved by the\nparticipants in condition A as opposed to condition B.\nThis amount of energy would be expended by leaving a\n60W bulb on for 9 days and result in Co2 emissions\nsimilar to those produced by driving an average UK\npetrol car for 399Km.\nfigure 5. Wattsup participant energy usage in each condition\nDISCUSSION\nOne UK study has claimed that sustained behavioural\nchange with domestic energy consumption was unlikely\nto alter until more than 3 months had elapsed [6].\nHowever, the energy feedback in that study was not\ndelivered within a socially enabled context; therefore it\nis possible that the claim of 3 months minimum for\nenergy usage behaviour change may not hold when a\ncontemporary online social network is used to deliver\nthe feedback. Due to time constraints and resources\navailable this project could not address the experiment\nduration issue for sustained behaviour change.\nThe interview data indicated that all of the participants\nenjoyed participating in the social condition: \u201cI\npreferred the second one (socially) because I am quite\ncompetitive, it gave me further incentive. I think\nputting a bit of fun in it is quite important\u201d. The\ncompetitive attribute was mentioned by several of the\nparticipants as being a motivating factor in reducing\ntheir energy usage.\nAn important issue in the development of energy\napplications that share information are privacy\nconcerns. A recent US home energy study received\nfeedback from participants regarding privacy issues and\nhow other people, possibly in their own neighbourhood,\ncould make inferences about their lifestyles by their\nenergy consumption [4]. This does raise legitimate\nethical and privacy concerns in how the Wattsup\napplication shares information between users and\npresents a challenge in how to integrate fine grain\ncontrol over sharing energy data. Interestingly, the\nissue of privacy when using Wattsup was not\nhighlighted by any of the participants taking part in the\nexperimental part of this study. However, similar to the\nprivacy issues in the aforementioned US study,\nconcerns such as \u201cThe risk of failure in front of your\nfriends.\u201d and \u201cNot sure if I would want to compare to\nothers\u201d were discussed in this studies focus group.\nCONCLUSION\nThe paper has described the design, deployment and\nevaluation of a Facebook application designed to allow\nfriends to compare their domestic energy consumption.\nThe results of the energy data collected from\nparticipants in this study suggests that social\nnetworking sites may be able to play a role in reducing\nenergy consumption in the home by making monitoring\nmore enjoyable. This was a small scale study and only\na larger investigation could conclusively determine how\neffective such applications may be. However, these\nresults are encouraging.\nSocial networking sites like Facebook and Twitter are\nincreasingly being appropriated by users for political\nand social ends. Facebook is of course primarily for fun\nbut it may be that the enjoyable aspects of the service\nthat make for effective platforms for persuasive\ntechnologies.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Abrahamse, W., Steg, L., Vlek, C., Rothengatter,\nT.
