Control charts are20\none of the monitoring tools employed in manufacture for the purpose of removal of21\nassignable causes every time when the process parameter has shifted. As control charts22\n\u2013 similar to other monitoring tools \u2013 may produce false signals that incorrectly indicate23\nthe state of the system, optimally designing the parameters of control charts to mini-24\nmize the cost incurred by the false signals is a vitally important topic in the research25\ncommunity of statistical process control. Various control charts have been considered26\nby researchers. Some examples are as follows. [1] and [2] separated the X\u00af-chart into27\nseveral zones and optimized the chart for monitoring a process whose deterioration can28\nbe classified into two states, in which one state requires minor repair and the other29\nrequires major repair. [3] used the p-chart to derive thresholds for aviation inspection.30\n[4] derived the expected long-run costs per unit time for a system monitored by the31\ncumulative count of conforming chart (CCC chart) where the system is maintained32\nCranfield University, School of Applied Sciences; Tel.: +44 -1234-754963; Fax: +44 -1234-\n751671; E-mail: shaomin.wu@cranfield.ac.uk\n2with different levels of inspection and maintenance. [5] considered economic design of33\ncontrol charts for optimization of preventive maintenance policies for systems. Other34\nexamples of research in this area can also be seen in [6] and [7].35\nWhen control charts are used, a general assumption is that the system being moni-36\ntored has three states: in-control, out-of-control, and failure. the in-control state is the37\nstate that the system functions without any problem, the out-of-control state means38\nthat the system has been disrupted by the occurrence of events called assignable causes39\nbut it still functions, and a failure state is the state that the system stops function-40\ning. The decision variables in designing a control chart can be the sampling interval41\nbetween consecutive sampling points, the sample size, or the control limits. Typical ap-42\nplication areas can be found in continuous manufacturing processes such as electronic43\nitem assembly lines.44\nThe parameters in a control chart can be variable, based on which we have two45\ndifferent kinds of control charts: static and adaptive. A static control chart has fixed46\nparameters such as sample size n, sampling interval h, lower control limit (LCL), and47\nupper control limit (UCL). On the other hand, an adaptive control chart has at least48\none of its parameters (n, h, LCL and UCL) that is allowed to be changed based on the49\nvalues of the sample statistics, which provides information about the current state of50\nthe process. An introduction to control charts can be found in [8].51\nAn adaptive control chart can utilise the inspection capacity more effectively for52\nbetter process control ([9\u201314,4]). There has been little work in investigating the poten-53\ntial of an adaptive control chart to monitor a system that has different repair levels.54\nHowever, it is vitally important for industrial practitioners to have tools or formulas55\nthat can help them to design maintenance regimes or\/and parameters of in-control56\ncharts, especially for adaptive controls charts (as a static control chart can be seen as57\na special case of an adaptive control).58\nThis paper presents the formulas of the expected long-run cost per unit time for a59\nsystem monitored by an adaptive control chart with variable sample sizes (VSS), which60\ncan ultimately be used to optimize the parameters in the control chart. The system is61\nassumed to have three states, in-control, out-of-control, and failed. The adaptive chart62\nhas three zones: central, warning, and action zones. If the quality characteristic (for63\nexample, the number of the non-defectives in the np control chart or the average of the64\nobservations in a subgroup for the X\u00af control chart) falls in the central zone, no action65\nwill be taken and the next sampling interval remains the same as its previous one. If66\nthe quality characteristic falls in the warning zones, more products will immediately67\nbe sampled. If the quality characteristic in the new sample falls in the central zone,68\nthen no action will be taken, otherwise, an inspection will be performed. If the quality69\ncharacteristic falls in the action zone, then an inspection will immediately be carried70\nout to check the existence of a possible assignable cause. If the assignable cause is71\nconfirmed, a minor repair will be conducted to remove the assignable cause. If the72\nsystem fails, then a major repair will be performed. Both the minor and major repairs73\nare perfect, that is, they can bring the system back to a good-as-new state.74\nIn this paper, we only consider a 3-state situation, which forms a multistate relia-75\nbility system. Research in multistate systems is another interesting topic in reliability76\ntheory and engineering, the reader is referred to [15,16], and [17] for more information.77\nThis paper does not specify a typical type of control charts. The result can be78\napplied to either attribute control charts (e.g, X\u00af control charts) or variable control79\ncharts (e.g., np control charts). But the numerical example uses an np control chart as80\nan example.81\n3This paper is structured as follows. The next section briefly introduces the VSS82\ncontrol chart. Section 3 presents assumptions and notation used in the paper. Section83\n4 formulates the expected long-run cost per unit time for systems monitored by the84\nVSS control chart. Section 5 offers numerical examples to perform sensitivity analysis85\nfor various parameter settings. Section 6 concludes the findings of this paper.86\n2 VSS control chart87\nA static control chart has two zones (see Figure 2(a)): central zone Zf0 and action88\nzones Zf1, whereas an adaptive control chart has three zones (see Figure 2(b)): central89\nzone Za0, warning zones Za1, and action zones Za2. From a comprehensive survey in90\nthe developments and the designs of adaptive control charts, the reader is referred to91\n[18].92\nA VSS control chart uses two different sample sizes alternatively, depending on the93\nquality characteristic of the process. If the quality characteristic is in the central state,94\nthen a normal sample size n0 is employed. Conversely, if the quality characteristic falls95\nin the warning zones (see Figure 2(b)), then a larger number n1(> n0) is used as the96\nnext sample size to confirm the existence of the possible assignable cause.97\n3 Assumptions and notation98\nConsider a system with three states: in-control, out-of-control, and failed, we make the99\nfollowing assumptions.100\nThe first sampling interval is h unit times immediately after the start of the system101\nand n0 samples are then collected. After that, there are following four situations.102\nA1. If the quality characteristic of the n0 samples falls in Za0 (see Figure 2(b)), then103\nthe next sample size will remain the same (ie., n0), and no further action will be104\ntaken.105\nA2. If the quality characteristic of the n0 samples falls in Za1, then the next sample106\nsize will be n1 with zero time interval, and an inspection will be carried out to107\ncheck whether the system is in-control or out-of-control. If the system is confirmed108\nto be out-of-control, then a minor repair is performed, otherwise, no further action109\nwill be taken and the next sampling interval will be h and the sample size will be110\nn0.111\nA3. If the quality characteristic of the n0 samples falls in Za2, then an inspection will112\nbe carried out to check the existence of the assignable cause. If the occurrence is113\nconfirmed by the inspection, then a minor repair is performed; otherwise, no further114\naction will be taken and the next sampling interval will be h and the sample size115\nwill be n0.116\nA4. If the system fails, then a major repair will be conducted immediately.117\nThe following assumptions are also held.118\n\u2013 Suppose that the system can shift from the in-control state to the out-of-control119\nstate and then to the failure state; but it cannot shift directly from the in-control120\nstate to the failure state without going through the out-of-control state, see Figure121\n1. Neither the failure state nor the out-of-control state can be restored back to the122\nin-control state without any intervention.123\n4\u2013 An inspection is assumed to be perfect in that it can reveal whether the system124\nis in-control or out-of-control. During an inspection, the system does not stop and125\ncarries on running. Once the system has been confirmed to be in the out-of-control126\nstate by the inspection, repairmen will carry out a minor repair which can bring the127\nsystem back to a good-as-new state. Once the system fails, repairmen will conduct128\na major repair. The major repair can bring the system back to a good-as-new state.129\n\u2013 For simplicity, times spent on an inspection, a minor or a major repair are so130\nshort compared to the sampling interval that can be neglected. But their costs are131\nconsidered.132\nWe also denote133\n\u2013 X1, random time from the beginning of the in-control state to the occurrence of134\nan assignable cause;135\n\u2013 f1(x1), pdf. of X1, and F1(x1) = Pr(X1 < x1), cdf. of X1;136\n\u2013 X2, random time from the beginning of the out-of-control state to failure;137\n\u2013 f2(x2), pdf. of X2, and F2(x2) = Pr(X2 < x2), cdf. of X2;138\n\u2013 n0, normal sample size;139\n\u2013 n1, larger sample size;140\n\u2013 h, sampling interval;141\n\u2013 cs, sampling cost per sample;142\n\u2013 ci, inspection cost for a possible assignable cause;143\n\u2013 cr1, cost for a minor repair;144\n\u2013 cr2, cost for a major repair;145\n\u2013 \u03b1ij , probability that the quality characteristic falls in Zaj (j = 0, 1, 2) when the146\nsystem is in the in-control state for i = 0, or in the out-of-control state for i = 1.147\nIt is for the situation when a sample size n0 is applied;148\n\u2013 \u03b2ij , the probability that the quality characteristic falls in Zaj (j = 0, 1, 2) when the149\nsystem is in the in-control state for i = 0, or in the out-of-control state for i = 1.150\nIt is for the situation when a sample size n1 is applied;151\n\u2013 Ta, renewal cycle length;152\n\u2013 Ta1, time to the first minor repair with an assignable cause detected by the control153\nchart in a sampling interval where a longer sample size is used;154\n\u2013 Ta2, time to the first minor repair with an assignable cause detected by the out-of-155\ncontrol signal by the control chart when a normal sample size is used;156\n\u2013 Ta3, time to failure; and157\n\u2013 Ca1, Ca2, Ca3, costs incurred within times Ta1, Ta2 and Ta3, respectively.158\nIn the following, we use the renewal reward theorem, which simply states that the159\nexpected long run cost per unit time is the ratio between the expected renewal cycle160\ncost and expected renewal cycle length [19].161\n4 Expected long-run cost per unit time162\nFrom the above assumptions, the system can be renewed by either a minor repair or163\na major repair, which are listed in Assumptions A2, A3, and A4. As such, these three164\ncases are listed in the following.165\nCase 1: From Assumption A2, a minor repair is conducted due to an assignable cause166\nthat is confirmed by a warning appeared in Za1. Namely, the system is in the out-167\nof-control state and the quality characteristic falls in Za1. In this case, the warning168\n5is signaled when the sample size n1 is applied. There might be the following three169\ncases.170\n\u2013 When the system is in the out-of-control state, a warning is signaled during a171\nsampling with the normal sample size n0. Then an additional sampling with172\nthe larger sample size n1 is immediately conducted, and then an inspection is173\ntaken. A minor repair is then conducted. See Figure 3(a).174\n\u2013 The system transits to the out-of-control state when a sampling with the normal175\nsample size n0 is being conducted. In this case, the signal from this sampling176\nis false and an additional sampling is conducted. See Figure 3(b).177\n\u2013 The system transits to the out-of-control state when a sampling with the normal178\nsample size n1 is being conducted. See Figure 3(c).179\nCase 2: Based on Assumption A3, a minor repair is conducted due to an assignable180\ncause that is confirmed by a warning appeared in Za2. In this case, the warning is181\nsignaled when the sample size n0 is applied.182\nCase 3: Based on Assumption A4, the system fails, but before the failure, no warning183\nhas been signaled.184\nBelow, the expected renewal cycle length of the above three cases are denoted by185\nE(Ta1), E(Ta2), and E(Ta3), respectively.186\n4.1 Expected renewal cycle length187\nThe expected renewal cycle length is E(Ta) = E(Ta1) + E(Ta2) + E(Ta3), which is188\nexplained as follows.189\nThe expected time between the start and a minor repair triggered by an inspection190\ndue to a signal in zone Za1 is given by191\nE(Ta1) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3\u03b111(1\u2212 \u03b210)H0\n\u222b H1\u2212h\nH1\u22122h\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 x1))dx1\n+ \u03b101\u03b1\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3\n10 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3+1(1\u2212 \u03b210)(H0 + 2h)\n\u222b H1\nH1\u2212h\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 + 2h\u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk2=0\n{\n\u03b101(1\u2212 \u03b210)H2\n\u222b H2\nH2\u2212h\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H2 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n, (1)\nwhere H0 = k1h + (\u03b101(k2 \u2212 1) + k3 + 1)h, H1 = k2h + \u03b101(k2 \u2212 1)h + h, and192\nH2 = k2h+ \u03b101k2h+ 2h.193\nProof The description of three terms in equation (1) is given below.194\nDenote k1 as the total number of sampling intervals in both the in-control and195\nout-of-control states, k2 as the total number of sampling intervals in an in-control196\nstate, and k3 as the number of false signals followed by true ones in the out-of-control197\nstate. The number k2 includes two scenarios: (1) the quality characteristics with the198\nnormal sample size n0 signal warnings that correctly indicate the system in the in-199\ncontrol state; and (2) the quality characteristics with the normal sample size n0 signal200\nwarnings that wrongly indicate that the system is in the out-of-control state, and then201\nfurther samplings with the larger sample size n1 are conducted.202\n6There are three scenarios for the system transiting from the in-control state to the203\nout-of-control state. These three states correspond to the following the three terms in204\nequation(1).205\nTerm 1. The system transits from the in-control state to the out-of-control state with206\na normal sample size n0. See Figure 3(a). When the system is in the out-of-control207\nstate, there might be false signals (with a probability of \u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 ) with a normal208\nsample size n0 and the false signals wrongly indicate that the system is in the209\nin-control state, or true signals with a larger sample size n1 but followed by false210\nsignals (with a probability of (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3): the true signals correctly indicate that211\nthe system is in the out-of-control state but its following sampling wrongly indicates212\nthat the system is in the in-control state. These two scenarios make up an event213\nwith a probability of (\u03b110)\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3(\u03b111\u03b210)k3 , and take time (k1 \u2212 k2 + k3)h.214\nEventually, a correct signal with a normal sample size is followed by another correct215\nsignal with a larger sample size, which has a probability of \u03b111(1\u2212\u03b210) and a time216\nlength of 2h.217\nBefore the system has transited from the in-control state to the out-of-control state,218\nthe time length is (k2\u22121)h+\u03b101(k2\u22121)h. Hence, the total length is k1h+(\u03b101(k2\u2212219\n1)+k3 +1)h = H0. The transition occurs in the time interval ((k2\u22121)h+\u03b101(k2\u2212220\n1)h, k2h+ \u03b101(k2 \u2212 1)h), or (H1 \u2212 2h,H1 \u2212 h).221\nTerm 2. See Figure 3(b). The system might also transit from the in-control state to222\nthe out-of-control state within a normal sample size after a false signal appears in223\nthe in-control state, but a correct signal follows. This event has a probability of224\n\u03b101(1\u2212 \u03b210) and a time length of h+ h. The time length of the system in the in-225\ncontrol state is (k2\u22121)h+\u03b101(k2\u22121)h, then the transition from the in-control state226\nto the out-of-control state occurs in (H1 \u2212 h,H1). After the system has transited227\nto the out-of-control state, the probability of the appearance of a correct signal is228\ngiven by \u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3+1\u03b101(1\u2212 \u03b210) and has a time length of H0 + 2h.229\nTerm 3. When the system is in the in-control state, a false signal appears with a230\nnormal sample size. See Figure 3(c). Then a larger sample size is used and the231\nsystem transits to the out-of-control state in this sampling interval, and then a232\ntrue signal appears. This event has a probability of \u03b101(1\u2212 \u03b210).233\nThe expected time between the start and a minor repair triggered by an inspection234\ndue to a signal in zone Za2 is given by235\nE(Ta2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3\u03b112(H0 \u2212 h)\n\u222b H1\u2212h\nH1\u22122h\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 h\u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n.\n(2)\nProof The proof is similar to that of E(Ta1), apart from the appearance of the out-of-236\ncontrol signals in a longer interval h in this case.237\nThe expected time between the start and a major repair is given by238\nE(Ta3) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 \u03b1\nk3\n11\u03b2\nk3\n10\n{\u222b H0\u2212h\nH0\u22122h\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u22122h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n7+ \u03b111\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u22122h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+\n\u222b H0\u2212h\nH0\u22122h\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+ \u03b111\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n}\n, (3)\nwhere \u03c4k1k2k3 =\n{\nH1 \u2212 h if k1 \u2212 k2 6= 0\nx if k1 \u2212 k2 = 0, and \u03c4\n\u2032\nk1k2k3\n=\n{\nH1 if k1 \u2212 k2 6= 0\nx if k1 \u2212 k2 = 0.239\nProof The system might transit from the in-control state to the out-of-control state240\neither in a sampling interval using a normal sample size or in a sampling interval using241\na larger sample size, and the system can then fail in both sampling intervals, which242\ncreates four scenarios. The first two terms in equation (3) correspond to the scenarios243\nwhen the transition from the in-control state to the out-of-control state occurs in a244\nsampling interval when a normal sample size n0 is conducted, and they correspond to245\nthe scenarios when the transition from the in-control state to the out-of-control state246\noccurs in a sampling interval when a larger sample size n1 is conducted.247\nThe first term in equation (3) is the scenario when the two transitions (i.e., from248\nthe in-control state to the out-of-control state and then fail) occur in longer sampling249\nintervals. The second term means that a correct signal appears in a longer sampling250\ninterval h (with a probability \u03b211) followed by a shorter sampling interval h for confir-251\nmation, but the system fails within this h. The third term means that the transition252\nfrom the in-control state to the out-of-control state occurs (with a probability \u03b201253\nfollowed by a shorter sampling interval). The last term means that the two scenarios254\noccur in short sampling intervals.255\n4.2 Expected renewal cycle cost256\nThe costs incurred during periods E(Tf1), E(Tf2), and E(Tf3) are derived in the257\nfollowing.258\nE(Ca1) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3\u03b111(1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H1\u2212h\nH1\u22122h\nC0f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 x1))dx1\n+ \u03b101\u03b1\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3\n10 \u03b1\nk3+1\n11 \u03b2\nk3+1\n10 (1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H1\nH1\u2212h\nC1f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 + 2h\u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk2=0\n{\n\u03b101(1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H2\nH2\u2212h\nC2f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H2 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n, (4)\nwhere C0 = k1n0cs+(\u03b101(k2\u22121)+k3+1)n1cs+((\u03b102+\u03b101(1\u2212\u03b200))(k2\u22121)+1)ci+cr1,259\nC1 = C0 + (n0 + n1)cs, and C2 = k2n0cs +\u03b101k2n1cs + (n0 + n1)cs + (\u03b102 +\u03b101(1\u2212260\n\u03b200))k2ci + ci + cr1.261\n8Proof After the system transited from the in-control state to the out-of-control state in262\na sampling interval when a normal sample size n0 is conducted, there will be two possi-263\nble scenarios before two warning signals appear consecutively in two sampling intervals264\nwith a normal sample size n0 and a larger sample size n1, respectively. The first scenario265\nis that incorrect signals (with a probability of \u03b210) appears, the second scenario is that266\na correct signal followed by an incorrect signal (with a probability of \u03b211\u03b210). These two267\nscenarios make up an event with a probability of (\u03b210)\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3(\u03b211\u03b210)k3\u03b211(1\u2212\u03b210),268\nand the event incurs sampling cost (k1 \u2212 k2 + 1)ncs + (k3 + 1)ncs. Before the system269\nhas transited from the in-control state to the out-of-control state, the sampling cost is270\nk2ncs + \u03b201k2ncs, inspection cost (\u03b202 + \u03b201(1\u2212 \u03b200)k2 + 1)ci, and cost cr1 on minor271\nrepair. Hence, the sub-total cost is C0.272\nThe system might also transit from the in-control state to the out-of-control state273\nwithin a interval when a larger sample n1 is conducted after a false signal appear in274\nthe in-control state. This event incurs cost ncs + ci + cr1. The cost incurred before the275\ntransition is k2ncs + \u03b201k2ncs + \u03b201\u03b201k2ci. The sub-total cost is C1.276\nA similar explanation to the third term in equation (4) can be given.277\nSimilarly,278\nE(Ca2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b111\u03b210)\nk3\u03b112\n\u222b H1\u2212h\nH1\u22122h\nC3f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 h\u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n,\n(5)\nwhere C3 = C0 \u2212 n1cs.279\nAnd finally, we have280\nE(Ca3) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n\u03b1k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 \u03b1\nk3\n11\u03b2\nk3\n10\n{\u222b H0\u2212h\nH0\u22122h\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u22122h\nC4f1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+ \u03b111\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u22122h\nC5f1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+\n\u222b H0\u2212h\nH0\u22122h\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h\nC6f1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+ \u03b111\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h\nC7f1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n}\n, (6)\nwhere C4 = k1n0cs+(\u03b101(k2\u22121)+k3)n1cs\u2212n0cs+((\u03b102+\u03b101(1\u2212\u03b200))(k2\u22121))ci+cr2,281\nC5 = C4 + n0cs + ci, C6 = C4, and C7 = C5.282\nHence, the expected long-run cost per unit time is given by283\nEa(T,C) =\nE(Ca1) + E(Ca2) + E(Ca3)\nE(Ta1) + E(Ta2) + E(Ta3)\n. (7)\nEa(T,C) in equation (7) can be minimized to obtain the optimal parameters such284\nas \u03b1ij and \u03b2ij , which is equivalent to optimize inspection policy for 3-state systems285\nmonitored by the adaptive control charts.286\n95 A data example287\nIn this section, we conduct use one numerical data example to investigate th impacts288\nof the cost parameters, assuming F1(x1) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212( x1300 )2.5), and F2(x2) = 1 \u2212289\nexp(\u2212( x2200 )4).290\nWe also assume the parameter values in Table 1 for the numerical example where291\nan np chart is used.292\nTable 2 indicates the results of the minimum expected long-run cost per unit time.293\nFor example, the optimum n1 is 144 when n0 = 80. This ensures the expected long-294\nrun cost per unit time to be minimal, or Ea(T,C) = 5.87. Comparing all of the costs295\nEa(T,C), it can be found that the expected long-run cost per unit time reaches the296\nminimal Ea(T,C) = 2.276 when n0 = 130 and n1 = 131. We also notice that the ratio297\nn1\nn0\nbecomes smaller when n0 increases.298\n5.1 Sampling cost cs299\nIf cs changes from 0.1 to 9.1 with step 1, the optimal n0 and n1 will change from 125300\nand 137 to 95 and 104 as shown in Table 3. It can be seen that Ea(T,C) changes from301\n2.285 to 11.761 when cs changes from 0.1 to 9.1.302\n5.2 Inspection cost ci303\nIf ci changes from 10 to 460, the optimal n0 and n1 will change from 140 and 154 to304\n120 and 132 as shown in Table 4. It is noticed that the sample sizes n0 and n1 remain305\nunchanged when ci changes in intervals (40,90), (100,110), or (160,460).306\n5.3 Minor repair cost cr1307\nIf cr1 changes from 50 to 4500, the optimal n0 and n1 changes as shown in Table 5.308\nIt is noticed that the optimum samples n0 and n1 do not change dramatically when309\ncr1 changes from 50 to 4500: the optimum n0 and n1 change from 130 and 143 to 110310\nand 121, respectively. This suggests that parameter cr1 is not sensitive to Ea(T,C)311\nwhen cr1 is in intervals (50,1500) or (2000,4000). We also notice that Ea(T,C) has a312\nlarge change, from 0.867 to 14.862 when cr1 changes from 50 to 4500.313\nIt is noticed that in the above three situations, optimum sample sizes are moving314\nin an opposite direction to that of the changes of costs, cs, ci, and cr1: the optimum315\nsample sizes become smaller when those costs become larger.316\n5.4 Major repair cost cr2317\nIf cr2 changes from 500 to 10000, the optimal n0 and n1 change as shown in Table 6.318\nWhen the major repair cr2 increases, the optimum sample sizes increase. It is319\nnoticed that the optimum sample sizes n0 and n1 remain their respective values, 130320\nand 143, unchanged, when cr2 changes from 4000 to 10000. The optimum sample sizes321\nn0 and n1 change when cr2 changes from 500 to 1000. This suggests that the parameter322\n10\ncr2 is not sensitive to the cost Ea(T,C) when cr2 is in the interval (4000,1000), but it323\nis sensitive to the cost Ea(T,C) when cr2 changes from 500 to 1000. In other words,324\nparameter cr2 is not sensitive to cost Ea(T,C) when cr2 is bigger, whereas cr2 is325\nsensitive to the cost Ea(T,C) when it is smaller. It is also noticed that Ea(T,C) has326\nonly a slight change, from 1.986 to 2.516, when cr2 conducts a big change, from 500 to327\n10000.328\n5.5 Discussion329\nFrom the above analysis, one can see that in some cases, the optimum sample sizes n0330\nand n1 remain unchanged although cost may change.331\nIt is also noticed that the sampling cost is the most sensitive one impacting Ea(T,C).332\nFor cost cr2, it is interesting to notice that the cost Ea(T,C) changes in different di-333\nrections from the above three costs: ci, cs and cr1: the optimum sample sizes increases334\nwhen cost cr2 on major repair increases, and the optimum sample sizes decreases when335\ncost cr2 on major repair increases.336\n6 Concluding remarks337\nIn this paper, the expected long-run cost per unit time is derived for the situation338\nwhere adaptive control charts with variable sample size are applied to monitor a system339\nwith three states: in-control, out-of-control and failure states. We have also conducted340\nsensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of each cost to the expected long-run341\ncost per unit time. It is found that the sample sizes become smaller when any of342\nthe individual cost (including sampling cost, inspection cost, and cost on minor repair)343\nincreases. However, the sample sizes become larger when cost on major repair increases.344\nAmong the four costs, sampling cost is the most sensitive one impacting the expected345\nlong-run cost per unit time.346\nIn practice, it is often found that estimating real costs incurred by sampling, in-347\nspection or repair is not easy. The sensitivity analysis on the parameters suggests that348\npractitioners can obtain optimum solutions although costs estimated may fall in inter-349\nvals, instead of precise values.350\nOur further work will be focused on investigating the scenario when different types351\nof maintenance models (see [20], for example) are considered.352\nAcknowledgment353\nWe are grateful to Professor Wenbin Wang for helpful discussion.
