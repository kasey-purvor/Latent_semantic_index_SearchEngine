Indigenous people along and\nwest of the Rhine River may have made \u201cLa Hoguette\u201d\npottery before the LBK era (Jeunesse 1987, Lu\u00a8ning, Kloos,\nand Albert 1989). In western Germany, flint tools from\nthe earliest LBK exhibit continuity with preceding Mes-\nolithic forms, and many are made of flint quarried from\nareas populated only by Mesolithic groups at that time\n(Mauvilly 1997, Gronenborn 1999). Mitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA) studies support the case for indigenous adop-\ntion (Richards et al. 1996, 2000), although such evidence\nis indirect because the mtDNA has come from modern\nEuropeans.\nThe two views have been difficult to resolve through\narchitecture or artifacts because ideas or trade items can\nspread without people\u2019s migrating. To examine human\nmobility directly, wemeasured strontium isotopes in hu-\nman skeletons from three LBK cemeteries in south-\nwestern Germany. Strontium substitutes for calcium in\nthe hydroxyapatite mineral of skeletal tissue, and stron-\ntium isotopes in prehistoric human teeth and bones pro-\nvide a geochemical signature of the place of residence.\nThe 87Sr\/86Sr values in natural rocks vary fromolder gran-\nites, with 87Sr\/86Sr ratios typically above 0.710 and as\nhigh as 0.740, to younger basalts, with lower 87Sr\/86Sr\nratios around 0.703 to 0.704. These differences, all in the\nthird decimal place, are easily detected by thermal ion-\nization mass spectrometry (TIMS), with which 87Sr\/86Sr\ncan be measured with a typical precision of 0.00001 or\nbetter.\nBecause of their large atomic mass, strontium isotopes\nretain the same 87Sr\/86Sr ratio as they pass from weath-\nered rocks through soils to the food chain (Hurst and\nDavis 1981, Beard and Johnson 2000). Even if there were\nsome mass-dependent fractionation of strontium along\nbiogeochemical pathways, it would be corrected for upon\nmeasurement by mass spectrometry, as strontium ratios\nare normalized to the constant value of 86Sr\/88Sr in nat-\nural rocks (Beard and Johnson 2000). In other words,\nstrontium isotopic signatures faithfully make their way\nfrom local geologic materials ultimately into the human\nskeleton.\nOne can identify migrant individuals who moved be-\ntween geologic regions by comparing the isotope signa-\nture in adult teeth, composed between four and twelve\nyears of age, with that in the bones, with characteristic\nturnover times varying between 6 and 20 years for dif-\nferent bones of the body (Parfitt 1983, Ericson 1985, Price\net al. 1994, Grupe et al. 1997, Grupe, Price, and So\u00a8llner\n800 F current anthropology\nFig. 1.

Inset: the distribution of LBK settlement ca. 5300 b.c.\n1999). If the teeth and bones of an adult have different\nsignatures, then that person spent his or her early and\nfinal years in different geochemical provinces (Ericson\n1989, Sealy et al. 1991, Price et al. 1994, Price, Grupe,\nand Schro\u00a8ter 1994, Price, Burton, and Bentley 2001). Be-\ncause bone phosphate is muchmore subject to postburial\ncontamination than the hydroxyapatite of tooth enamel\n(Price, Burton, and Bentley 2001), it is oftenmore reliable\nto compare each individual tooth value with a \u201clocal\u201d\n87Sr\/86Sr range defined for the recovery site rather than\nwith the different individual bone values. Here we define\nthe local signature at a site as within two standard de-\nviations of the average 87Sr\/86Sr of the sample of human\nbones from the site. This conservative definition is un-\nlikely to misidentify locals as immigrants (Grupe et al.\n1997, Grupe, Price, and So\u00a8llner 1999, Price, Burton, and\nBentley 2001). Local ranges in surrounding areas can be\ncharacterized by indicators such as the 87Sr\/86Sr in\nstreamwaters or (better) the skeletons or shells of local\nanimals (Price, Burton, and Bentley 2001).\nOur study area in southwestern Germany is geochem-\nically appropriate for this investigation. Higher 87Sr\/86 Sr\nvalues ( 1 0.715) are found in area uplands underlain by\ngranites, including (fig. 1) the Odenwald (near Flomborn\nand Schwetzingen), the Bavarian Forest (near Dillingen),\nand the Vosges and Black Forest mountains (Grupe et al.\n1997, Tricca et al. 1999, Probst et al. 2000, Price et al.\n2001). These uplands are isotopically distinct frommost\nof the regional lowlands (87Sr\/86Sr ! 0.710). Elsewhere,\nloess sediment can have higher 87Sr\/86Sr values, ranging\nfrom 0.713 to 0.716 in Brittany and Normandy, for ex-\nample (Gallet et al. 1998). Within the study region, how-\never, loess patches appear to be unlikely sources for the\nhigher 87Sr\/86Sr values because (1) loess in southern Ger-\nmany is rich in carbonates derived from the Alps (Ma-\nhaney and Andres 1991, Schnetger 1992, Hatte\u00b4 et al.\n1998), for which the expected 87Sr\/86Sr is about\n0.7080\u20130.7095 and (2) snail and human bone samples so\nfar analyzed fromDillingen and Flomborn, both on loess,\nexhibit 87Sr\/86Sr below 0.710 (Bentley 2001: table 5.1).\nWe sampled human skeletal remains from LBK cem-\neteries and found a high incidence of migration at the\nLBK cemeteries of Flomborn and Schwetzingen, near\nHeidelberg, and at Dillingen, near Ulm (fig. 1, table 1)\n[The data are presented in the electronic edition of this\nissue on the journal\u2019s web page]. We identified 7 non-\nlocals out of the 11 individuals (64%) sampled from\nFlomborn, 9 out of 36 (25%) from Schwetzingen, and 11\nout of 17 (65%) from Dillingen. Four patterns have\nemerged from the data (fig. 2, table 2) which, taken to-\ngether, suggest that nonlocals in these LBK cemeteries\nhad social identities different from the locals. These pat-\nterns are as follows:\n1. Nonlocal females are common.

Each symbol represents a different individual: circles, female; squares, male; triangles, unknown sex\n(due to young age at death). Filled symbols, burials with shoe-last adze; empty symbols, burials without adze.\n(There were no adzes in the sampled Schwetzingen burials.) The \u201clocal\u201d 87Sr\/86Sr range has been defined as two\nstandard deviations from the average human bone value at each site (individual bone values not shown). The\nlocal range for each site is indicated by a gray bar.\nat Flomborn that have been identified by sex, all 4 (100%)\nof the females are nonlocals (fig. 2, a). At Schwetzingen,\n5 of 16 females (31%) are nonlocals, all with tooth-en-\namel values above the local range (fig. 2, b). Three of the\n16 males (19%) are nonlocals, but 2 of those have tooth\nvalues below the local range, that is, characteristic of a\ndifferent geochemical zone from that of individuals\nabove the range. Thus five of the six tooth values above\nthe local range at Schwetzingen are from females. At\nDillingen (fig. 2, c), all 5 (100%) of the females are non-\nlocals (all above the local range) compared with 6 out of\n12 nonlocal males (5 above the local range, 1 below).\n2. 87Sr\/86Sr may correlate with burial orientation. At\nSchwetzingen, 7 (30%) of the 23 burials with head di-\nrections ranging from north to east are nonlocals, com-\npared with two nonlocals (15%) among the 13 burials\nfacing in other directions (fig. 2). At Flomborn, 4 (80%)\nof the 5 sampled west-facing burials are immigrants.\n3. Many nonlocals are buried without a shoe-last adze\n(a characteristic artifact of the LBK). At both Flomborn\nand Dillingen, burials with shoe-last adzes are signifi-\ncantly more likely to be locals than those without (table\n2). Four of the 6 (67%) Flomborn burials without a shoe-\nlast adze have tooth values above the local range.

The\nmost convincing patterns are those that are repeated.\n5 Flomborn burials with a shoe-last adze, only 1 (20%)\nhas a tooth value above the local range (fig. 2). Among\nthe 11 burials without a shoe-last adze at Dillingen, 9\n(82%) are nonlocals, all with tooth values above the local\nrange. Of the 6 Dillingen burials with a shoe-last adze,\n2 (33%) are nonlocals, and only 1 of those is above the\nlocal range. The presence of nonlocal males without\nadzes confirms that the correlation is not merely be-\ntween shoe-last adzes andmales who happen to be locals.\n4. Nonlocal 87Sr\/86Sr values are mostly above the local\nrange for their place of burial. Of the 27 immigrants from\nthe three sites, 23 tooth values are above the local range\nfor the site and only 4 below it.\nThe last pattern is suggestive of where the nonlocals\nobtained their diet in the younger part of their lives. The\n87Sr\/86Sr values for the nonlocals are not high enough,\nhowever, to be \u201cfrom\u201d the granitic uplands, where water\nsamples are generally above 0.720 (Tricca et al. 1999,\nProbst et al. 2000). The best interpretation at this point\nmay be that the higher 87Sr\/86Sr values reflect a signifi-\ncant proportion of the diet from the regional uplands. If\nso, the higher 87Sr\/86Sr values may reflect a larger diet\ncatchment rather than a fixed \u201corigin\u201d for the nonlocals.\nOptimal foraging theory predicts that a six-household\nLBK village in southwestern Germany would require 6\nkm2 of agricultural land, supplemented by about 14%\nwild foods (Gregg 1988). At the same time, Gregg (1988)\nestimates the optimal diet forMesolithic foragers as 80%\nwild game, 20% wild plants. A simple calculation based\non these figures and the local geology shows that if one-\nquarter of the wild foods came from the granitic uplands\nand all the agricultural foods were locally grown, the\npredicted 87Sr\/86Sr would be 0.71036 for Flomborn farm-\ners and 0.71113 for foragers (Bentley 2001:247\u201351).\nThe enamel 87Sr\/86Sr values for many of the nonlocals\nat Flomborn and Schwetzingen are close to the value\npredicted for foragers. Because Early LBK sites are nu-\nmerous in the Rhine Valley lowlands but scarce in the\nuplands, a viable hypothesis is that some of the nonlocals\nwere the foragers who may have frequented the area up-\nlands during the early LBK (Cziesla 1994). The frequent\nabsence of a shoe-last adze with these nonlocals also\nsuggests that they may have been foragers. Indigenous\nforagers were significant agents in the spread of farming\ninto southwestern Germany, influenced by small groups\nof immigrant farmers (Gronenborn 1999, Price et al.\n2001). Near the western limit of the LBK at the time,\nnonlocals of both sexes at Flomborn may represent its\ninitial residents, whose diet catchment had been larger\nbefore they settled. Later on in the same region, at\nSchwetzingen, there is less immigration overall, mostly\ninvolving females with similar \u201cupland\u201d strontium iso-\ntope signatures. The nonlocal females invite a compar-\nison with models and ethnographic cases of forager\nwomen who marry into farmer or pastoral communities\n(Zvelebil and Rowley-Conwy 1984, Cronk 1989, Zvelebil\nand Lillie 2000, Thorp 2000).\nAn alternative interpretation for the data we have pre-\nsented here is that the migration did not involve foragers\nat all. There are few archaeological traces of Mesolithic\noccupation in the uplands around Bavaria or the Upper\nRhine Valley at the time of the transition to the Neo-\nlithic (Nielsen 1997, Taute 1988, Jochim 1998). However,\nthe reason so few Terminal Mesolithic sites have been\ndiscovered is at least partly their ephemeral nature. Late\ndates from Late\/Terminal Mesolithic sites in southern\nGermany and eastern France overlap with the early LBK\nperiod, indicating that foragers persisted into the LBK\n(Brunnacker et al. 1967, Kind 1997, Gronenborn 1999,\nJochim 2000).\nIn any case, strontium isotope analysis of LBK skele-\ntons suggests that many people made residential changes\nduring the LBK of the Rhine Valley. Whether it involved\nforagers or farmers, the observed pattern of female mi-\ngration is consistent with genetic evidence for patrilo-\ncality in European prehistory (Seielstad, Minch, and\nCavalli-Sforza 1998). Although our evidence is not con-\nclusive, it can be seen to support the interpretation (e.g.,\nGronenborn 1999, Zvelebil 2000, Price 2000) that Neo-\nlithic colonization of southeastern Europe was followed\nby some degree of indigenous adoption in central and\nnorthern Europe.\nReferences Cited\na m m e r m a n , a . j . , a n d l . l . c a v a l l i - s f o r z a . 1984.\nThe Neolithic transition and the genetics of populations in Eu-\nrope.

In contrast to rural Gypsies, those liv-\ning in urban communities encounter opportunities for\nexogamy. As a result, although Gypsy communities are\ntraditionally highly endogamous, those in Hungary ex-\nhibit varying levels of exogamy, a practice that seems\nboth to favour differential investment in daughters and\nto yield high fitness returns (measured in terms of num-\nbers of grandchildren) (Bereczkei and Dunbar 1997). Yet\ndespite high levels of endogamy, rural Gypsies nonethe-\nless show a female-biased sex ratio at birth and invest\nmore heavily in daughters much as urban Gypsies do\n(Bereczkei and Dunbar 1997). That even those popula-\ntions that experience fewer opportunities for endogamy\n\u0002 2002 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Re-\nsearch. All rights reserved 0011-3204\/2002\/4305-0007$1.00\nshould show female-biased investment seems anoma-\nlous. One possible explanation is that daughters provide\na valuable service in that they are more likely than\nGypsy boys or ethnic Hungarian girls to help their par-\nents in taking care of siblings.\nOne of the potentially altruistic social interactions be-\ntween genetic relatives is that in which older siblings\nhelp with the rearing of younger ones (Emlen 1984). Since\nthe production of a full sibling contributes to the indi-\nvidual\u2019s reproductive success as much as the production\nof an offspring, a trade-off is expected to develop which\nallows individuals to increase their inclusive fitness.\nOne strategy is to invest directly in one\u2019s own repro-\nductive effort by having more offspring of one\u2019s own; the\nother is to help parents rear younger siblings (Charnov\n1981, Woodroffe and Vincent 1995). The latter is likely\nto be realized when (a) the offspring can provide valuable\nhelp in child care and (b) parents have opportunities for\nproducing additional children when the older offspring\nbegin helping (Betzig and Turke 1986, Turke 1988). In\none of the few studies carried out on humans, Turke\n(1988) has shown that daughters contributed to their par-\nents\u2019 reproductive success on Ifaluk (Micronesia): among\nwomen who had completed fertility, those who had\nborne a daughter first had a larger number of surviving\nchildren than those who had borne a son first.\nThe present study investigates the circumstances un-\nder which helping-at-the-nest might be advantageous in\na Hungarian Gypsy population. Gypsy girls traditionally\nhelp with raising younger children, and their parents ex-\npect them to engage in various kinds of duties such as\nlooking after babies, playing with children, and cooking.\nGypsy families differ considerably in these respects from\nthe ethnic Hungarians among whom they live; the eth-\nnic Hungarians thus provide a benchmark population\nagainst which to evaluate the behaviour of the Gypsies.\nThe following assumptions and predictions are test-\ned:\nAssumption 1: Gypsy girls spend more time caring for\ntheir younger siblings than Gypsy boys. The difference\nis not expected to be significant among ethnic Hun-\ngarians.\nAssumption 2: Given the assistance expected by\nGypsy mothers from older girls, first-born daughters will\nremain at home with their parents longer than first-born\nsons or later-born daughters, even if they have already\nmarried.\nIf these assumptions hold, then the following func-\ntional consequences should follow if the helpers-at-the-\nnest hypothesis is true: Gypsy mothers of daughters who\nact as helpers should have (1) shorter inter-birth intervals\nand (2) longer reproductively active life spans (the period\nbetween first and last offspring) than mothers of non-\nhelpers; if (1) and (2) are both true, then it should follow\nthat (3) mothers of helpers will have more children than\nthose having first-born sons, whereas no such differences\nare expected among ethnic Hungarians.\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 805\nFig. 1. Mean lifetime fertility (completed family size) of Gypsy and non-Gypsy mothers as a function of the sex\nof their first-born offspring.\nmethods\nThe present study involved two rural populations: a\nGypsy population living in Gilvanfa and a number of\nsmall villages around Gilvanfa (total number of adult\nfemale subjects aged above 45 years p 119) and a non-\nGypsy (ethnic Hungarian) population living in a predom-\ninantly ethnic Hungarian village named Magyarmecske\nand other small nearby villages, which acted as a control\ngroup (total number of adult female subjects aged above\n45 yearsp 137). Gilvanfa and Magyarmecske, which are\n5 km apart, are relatively poor areas of Hungary, the\ninhabitants of both ethnic groups all being victims of\nrecent economic changes. They are located in the same\nculturally and historically homogeneous county (Bar-\nanya) and the same administrative district. There are\nsignificant differences between the two populations in\neducation, income, and occupation. More Gypsies than\nethnic Hungarians are unemployed, and they are more\nlikely to have completed fewer than eight years of ed-\nucation and to have an annual income lower than the\nnational average (see Bereczkei and Dunbar 1997).\nThe fieldwork lasted from August 1994 to June 1995.\nAll 256 individuals were interviewed, using a question-\nnaire with 590 variables covering a full reproductive his-\ntory (pregnancies, births, stillbirths, deaths, and inter-\nbirth intervals) as well as details of the family social and\neducational circumstances and history. Additionally, the\nextent of helping behaviour was determined for a sample\nof 55 Gypsy girls over a total of 56 days and 42 ethnic\nHungarian girls over 45 days. Observations were carried\nout in the subject\u2019s home for up to two hours at a time\nat intervals of three to four days, recording all gross be-\nhavioural acts performed by the subject. Since village\nhouses were quite open, observation conditions were ex-\ncellent. More than 12,000 behavioural acts were re-\ncorded. The subject\u2019s activity was later coded as one of\neight mutually exclusive categories (changing the baby,\nholding babies, guarding babies and children, playing\nwith children, cooking for children, helping in prepara-\ntion for school, earning money for siblings, and a general\ncategory for all non-child-care behaviours).\nSince our interest was in measures of fitness rather\nthan fertility per se, we indexed completed family size\nas the number of offspring who survived to 12 months\nof age for females aged 45 and above. Birth-spacing data\nwere analysed by the survival (or cumulative hazard)\nmethod (Forthofer and Lee 1995). These data are used to\nexamine the distribution of different lengths of time be-\ntween two events and to calculate the proportion of cases\nfor which the terminal event has occurred. The hazard\nfunction enables us to compare two sets of inter-birth\nintervals (for women having first-born daughters and\nthose having first-born sons) and to estimate the prob-\nabilities of intervals\u2019 occurring at different time points.\nresults\nThe Gypsy women in this sample had had an average of\n3.93 \u0003 2.56 live births, compared with 2.32 \u0003 1.72 live-\nborn infants for the ethnic Hungarian women (Mann-\nWhitney z p 6.08; N[G] p 119, N[H] p 137, P ! 0.001).\nGypsy mothers who bore daughters first had more chil-\ndren than those who bore sons first (fig. 1) (mean number\nof living offspring at the time of the study 4.44 versus\n3.48 offspring, respectively; Mann-Whitney z p 2.89,\n806 F current anthropology\ntable 1\nCumulative Probability of Having a Subsequent Birth as a Function of the Sex of the Firstborn Offspring for\nGypsy Women\nDuration of Interval\n(months)\nCumulative Probabilitya of a Subsequent Birth\nFirst Birth Interval After Second Birth Interval After Third Birth Interval After\nA Son A Daughter A Son A Daughter A Son A Daughter\n12 0.13 0.25 0.11 0.36 0.29 0.07\n24 0.50 0.73 0.19 0.54 0.35 0.36\n36 0.65 0.86 0.44 0.68 0.58 0.71\n48 0.83 0.89 0.52 0.79 0.76 0.86\n60 0.87 0.97 0.63 0.82 0.83 0.93\n72 0.91 0.99 0.73 0.86 0.91 0.97\n84 0.98 1.00 0.82 0.93 0.98 1.00\nnote: Median inter-birth intervals are as follows: first, 38.4 (son), 54.0 (daughter) (P ! 0.05); second, 38.2 (son), 37.6 (daughter) (P !\n0.05); third, 40.8 (son), 37.6 (daughter) (P 1 0.05).\naEstimated by the hazard method of Forthofer and Lee (1995).\nNp 64 and 53, Pp 0.002). Among the non-Gypsy ethnic\nHungarians, the difference between these two groups\nwas not significant (means of 2.23, N p 61 versus 2.39,\nN p 73, respectively; Mann-Whitney z p 0.102; P p\n0.91).\nSignificant differences in birth spacing occur between\nGypsy mothers having first-born daughters and those\nwho bore sons first. Table 1 shows the cumulative prob-\nability of having a subsequent birth at different points\nin the birth order as a function of the sex of the first\noffspring when inter-birth intervals are allowed to vary\nbetween 12 and 84 months. Women having first-born\ndaughters (Np 64) typically have shorter birth intervals\n(irrespective of individual offspring\u2019s sex) than those hav-\ning first-born sons (Np 53). Nearly three-quarters of the\nwomen in the former group gave birth to a second child\nwithin two years, compared with half of the women in\nthe latter group. Although the difference between the\ntwo groups of mothers is not significant for the third\ninterval, a relatively large cumulative effect can be seen\nover a life span (fig. 2). Gypsy mothers gave birth to their\nfourth child 8.63 years after their first-born daughter but\n11.09 years after a first-born son (Long Rank Test [see\nForthofer and Lee 1995] z p 2.11, P p 0 ! 0.05). Most\nFig. 2. Probability of having a subsequent birth (prior to the fourth birth) as a function of sex of the first-born\noffspring among Gypsy women.\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 807\nof this difference can be attributed to shortened inter-\nbirth intervals after each successive birth, not just a\nshorter inter-birth interval after the first-born daughter.\nMoreover, this difference occurs despite the fact that\nGypsies breast-feed their daughters longer than they do\ntheir sons (see Bereczkei and Dunbar 1997).\nAmong 53 Gypsy women who had sons first, only 12\nbore more than four children, whereas 29 of the 64\nwomen having first-born daughters bore five ormore sur-\nviving children. Put another way, 7.6% of the 184 chil-\ndren in son-first families were born as fifth or subsequent\nchildren compared with 16.3% of 286 children in daugh-\nter-first families (x2p 31.12, P ! 0.001). In contrast, there\nis no difference between the equivalent two groups in\nthe ethnic Hungarian population (x2 p 2.85, P p 0.89).\nThese data suggest that females who bore a daughter\nfirst continue reproducing to an older age. Indeed, for\nwomen over 45 whose first child was a daughter, the age\nat the birth of the last child was 37.4 compared with 34.2\nfor women whose first child was a son (Mann-Whitney\nz p 5.24, N p 64 and 53 respectively, P ! 0.001).\nDuring the interviews, 80% of both Gypsy and ethnic\nHungarian mothers reported that their oldest girls par-\nticipated in household duties (comparison between eth-\nnic groups of number of subjects making such a state-\nment: x2p 0.795, Np 97, P ! 0.85). As far as housework\n(such as cleaning and cooking) is concerned, no signifi-\ncant differences were found between the two commu-\nnities in a comparison across households for children of\napproximately the same age. However, striking differ-\nences were found in respect of child-care-related activ-\nities such as looking after babies, playing with children,\nand helping in preparation for school. In households\nwhere there was at least one younger child to be looked\nafter, 77.9% of the 73 first- and second-born Gypsy girls\nolder than ten years of age were regularly involved in\nthe care of their younger sibling(s) compared with only\n51.2% of 46 later-born Gypsy girls (x2p 12.54 corrected\nfor continuity, P ! 0.01); in contrast, 58.4% of first- and\nsecond-born and 39.2% of later-born ethnic Hungarian\ngirls older than ten years of age engaged in these tasks\n(x2 p 2.16 corrected for continuity, P 1 0.05). Neither of\nthese values is significantly different from that for later-\nborn Gypsy girls, but both are significantly less than the\nequivalent figure for early-born Gypsy girls.\nTable 2 shows the mean proportion of time spent in\nvarious helping activities during the observational sam-\nples by ethnic Hungarian andGypsy daughters. First- and\nsecond-born Gypsy girls of all ages devoted a signifi-\ncantly higher proportion of their time to child-care ac-\ntivities than later-born girls, and these differences hold\nup even when only girls older than ten years are consid-\nered (overall mean for individual subjects for all child-\ncare categories 39.8% versus 21.8% of activities, respec-\ntively; Mann-Whitney test, z p 3.12, P ! 0.005). The\ndifferences are highly significant for each helping cate-\ngory. Similar differences have been found between early-\nborn Gypsy daughters and early-born ethnic Hungarian\ndaughters, although they are not significant in three cat-\negories (changing the baby, guarding babies and children,\nhelping in preparation for school).\nMany of these activities continue even after the girls\nget married. First-born Gypsy daughters marry on aver-\nage at 17.5 years of age, but they do not leave home and\nbegin to live separately from their parents until they are\non average 19.7 years old (fig. 3). In other words, early-\nborn Gypsy girls stay at home for almost two years after\nmarriage or cohabitation (Mann-Whitney test comparing\nage at marriage and age at leaving home: zp 2.75, Np\n46, P ! 0.005), during which time they continue to help\ntheir parents raise their younger siblings. For Gypsy sons\nand ethnic Hungarian sons and daughters, the difference\nbetween the age of marriage and the age of separation\nfrom parents is reversed and, in each case, also significant\n(Gypsy sons, z p 4.18, P ! 0.001; ethnic Hungarian\ndaughters, z p 3.96, P ! 0.001; ethnic Hungarian sons,\nzp 3.39, P ! 0.001). In other words, they typically leave\nhome first and marry afterwards.\ndiscussion\nWe have shown that, in this rural population, (1) early-\nborn Gypsy girls engage in substantial help in housework\nrelated to child care of their younger siblings even after\ntheir marriage; (2) this assistance both increases the\nlength of the mother\u2019s reproductive career and reduces\ninter-birth intervals for subsequent children; and (3)\nGypsy women giving birth to first-born daughters have\nsignificantly more children than those giving birth to\nsons first.\nThese results raise the question of how female-biased\nstrategies increase inclusive fitness. Natural selection\nmay favour sex biases in parental investment if one sex\nof offspring enhances the reproductive success of its par-\nents (or siblings) by providing resources (Hamilton 1967).\nOffspring that provide help to their parents or siblings\nrepay some of the costs of parental investment, and this\nassistance may reduce the parents\u2019 net reproductive cost\n(Sieff 1990). Although these ideas have only rarely been\ntested in human societies (Cronk 1989, 1991), there is\nevidence that offspring can contribute to parents\u2019 repro-\nductive costs in a number of different ways. In South\nAsia, for example, Kanjar females are more economically\nproductive than males and help their brothers to marry.\nAmong the Mundugumor of Papua New Guinea, fathers\nfavour daughters, who are then used to obtain wives for\ntheir brothers (Cronk 1991). On the Micronesian island\nof Ifaluk, daughters are more likely than sons to assist\ntheir parents in future reproduction. Women who bear a\ndaughter first have greater reproductive success than\nthose who bear a son first (Turke 1988). However, there\nis no evidence of female-biased investment among the\nIfaluk.\nOur data from a rural Gypsy population seem to pro-\nvide another example of the same phenomenon: having\na first-born daughter reduces the mother\u2019s costs of rear-\ning her current infant, thus allowing her to transfer the\nresulting spare time and energy to producing and raising\nadditional children. The female surplus among first-born\n808 F current anthropology\ntable 2\nChild Care Activities Involving Siblings by Girls Older than Ten Years as a Proportion of All Recorded Behav-\nioural Acts\nActivity\nPercentage of Timea\nEarly-Bornb Gypsy\nDaughters\nLater-Born Gypsy\nDaughters\nEarly-Bornb Ethnic\nHungarian Daughters\nLater-Born Ethnic\nHungarian Daughters\nChanging the baby 4.8 4.6 3.7 1.9\nHolding babies 4.7 2.1 2.8 0.9\nGuarding babies and\nchildren\n7.1 3.4 5.2 2.8\nPlaying with children 8.3 4.7 3.9 2.1\nCooking for children 5.6 2.3 2.1 0.8\nHelping in prepara-\ntion for school\n5.2 2.6 5.8 1.3\nEarning money for\nsiblings\n4.1 2.1 1.0 0.1\naOverall mean of values for individual subjects.\nbFirst- and second-born.\noffspring and the female-biased child-care patterns ob-\nserved in this rural Gypsy population may therefore be\nintended to increase the number of children rather than\nto produce a Trivers-Willard (1973) effect (which may be\na strategy more characteristic of urban Gypsy popula-\ntions).\nA female-biased sex ratio thus seems to be associated\nwith two kinds of parental strategies among the Gypsies.\nIn an urban environment, given relatively scarce and un-\npredictable resources and the opportunity for hypergamy\ninto the sympatric wealthier ethnic Hungarian popula-\ntion, Gypsy girls, rather than sons, are favoured by their\nparents because, in contrast to sons, they have the op-\nportunity of \u201cmarrying up\u201d into the ethnic Hungarian\npopulation. In terms of breast-feeding and education,\nthese Gypsy parents therefore invest more heavily in\ntheir daughters (Bereczkei and Dunbar 1997). In themore\nendogamous rural environment, in contrast, there are no\nlarge local status and wealth differentials (Gypsies and\nethnic Hungarians live in separate villages), and thus\nthere is no real chance of marrying up. Instead, early-\nborn Gypsy girls are expected to engage in helping ac-\ntivities related to child care that reduce the mother\u2019s\nburden from parental duties. Among rural Gypsies,\ntherefore, older girls enhance the resource base of their\nyounger siblings. These results thus suggest that the\nFig. 3. Mean age of marriage and mean age of leaving home for Gypsy and non-Gypsy children.\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 809\nchoices that individuals make are highly contingent on\ncircumstances.\nOne common counterargument against the helping-\nat-the-nest model is that people prefer sons and therefore\nproduce as many children as necessary to obtain a son.\nHence, having had a daughter first, they are more likely\nto continue reproduction for longer in order to be sure\nof getting a son. This argument is difficult to refute on\ndemographic data alone. However, our results suggest\nthat female-biased sex ratios among the Gypsies are not\na by-product of a preference for sons; they genuinely pre-\nfer daughters and invest more heavily in them. Invest-\nment differentials were demonstrated in respect of\nhigher abortion rates after daughters, longer breast-feed-\ning, and longer periods of education for daughters in both\nurban and rural communities (Bereczkei and Dunbar\n1997). If sons were considered more valuable, these dif-\nferences in direct and indirect parental care would have\nshown the reverse pattern.\nDaughters thus seem to be the focus of Gypsies\u2019 fer-\ntility in both urban and rural communities. This may be\none of the reasons first-born Gypsy children still fre-\nquently inherit the mother\u2019s name rather than the fa-\nther\u2019s as is otherwise the norm inHungary and elsewhere\nin Europe. The influential role that Gypsy girls and\nwomen play in family life may be reflected in the fact\nthat Gypsies are frequently cited as a society based on a\nform of \u201cmatriarchy.\u201d\nFinally, it is worth emphasizing that one inevitable\nreason late-born Gypsy daughters engage in relatively\nlittle helping-at-the-nest is that they have less oppor-\ntunity to benefit from enhancing their mothers\u2019 fertility\nbecause their mothers are already approaching meno-\npause. Although late-born daughters should have the\nsame beneficial effect on the mother\u2019s time and energy\nbudgets by relieving her of child care for younger siblings,\nthe fitness payoff that accrues to the mother from pro-\nducing a late-born daughter relative to that for producing\na late-born son is much lower because the mother has\nfewer future reproductive opportunities to offer. On av-\nerage, the Gypsy mothers in the sample produced their\nthird-born child at age 25.5 and their fourth-born child\nat age 27.5; mothers would thus be in their late 30s and\nalready approaching the end of active reproduction by\nthe time these offspring were old enough to help with\nchild care (10\u201312 years of age). Since these will, on av-\nerage, be second-born daughters, later-born daughters are\nlikely to be too young to have a significant impact on\nthe mother\u2019s reproductive output; they are therefore\nmore likely both to resist requests to provide child care\nand to pursue their own interests. At the same time,\nmothers will have less to gain from their help and are\ntherefore likely to be less willing to engage in conflict\nwith their daughters.\nReferences Cited\nb e r e c z k e i , t . , a n d r . i . m . d u n b a r . 1997.

Indeed, oracle-bone and bronze\ninscriptions suggest that the collecting of milk from\ncows and mares was not an unfamiliar art during the\nShang Dynasty (ca. 1520\u20131030 b.c.).2 Moreover, accord-\n\u0002 2002 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Re-\nsearch.

This issue was raised more than a century ago by Hahn (1896)\nand commented on by Laufer (1914\u201315:168) and Creel (1937:80).\nFor a detailed discussion see Simoons (1991:454\u201363).\n2. From an analysis of Shang oracle bones and ancient bronzes Yuan\n(1986) has proposed that the glyph which has been customarily\nrendered as nai (1) (a conjunctive and disjunctive particle) should\nbe interpreted as nai (2) (milk) (see appendix, column 2). His idea\nis supported by Xu (1989:500), who points out that the original\npictogram of the word is an excellent representation of the shape\nof the teats of lactating female mammals.\n810 F current anthropology\ning to the Shiji (Records of the Historian) (110) and the\nQian Hanshu (History of the Former Han Dynasty) (94:\n3759), by the end of the Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1030\u2013221\nb.c.) the Chinese were well aware of the fact that milk\nwas the primary food resource of the nomadic neighbors\nand adversaries who lived beyond the northern rim of\ntheir homeland.3 We also know that milk has been used\nas a medication since at least the Western Han Dynasty\n(202 b.c.\u2013a.d. 9)4 and has been listed in all the standard\npharmacopoeias since the Mingyi bielu (Informal Re-\ncords of Famous Physicians) of a.d. 510.5 We are thus\nfaced with two intriguing questions. First, why did the\nancient Chinese fail to develop dairy farming? Second,\nwhy did they fail to adopt milk as food resource once\nthe nutritional value of dairy products had been dem-\nonstrated by their northern nomadic neighbors?\nhypolactasia and lactose absorption\nThe answer to the first question is in fact quite straight-\nforward. The reason the ancient Chinese did not develop\ndairy farming is that the consumption of substantial\namounts of milk could be hazardous to their health.\nTo many people in Europe or North America it may\nstill seem incredible that milk could be harmful to any-\none\u2019s health.6 Yet as early as 400 b.c. Hippocrates is re-\nported to have observed7 that milk was bad for patients\nwith fever whose bellies were \u201cdistended and full of rum-\nbling\u201d (Chadwick and Mann 1950:168). And in a.d. 200\nGalen noted (Green 1951:210\u201311, cited in Sahi 1994b:\n17):\nWith regard to milk, it should not be given to all,\nbut only to those who digest it well and perceive no\nsymptom in the right hypochondrium. For even if\nsometimes it should ever be taken without bread, it\nboth goes through more quickly and is flatulent. \u2014\nBut somebody was sick all the time, no matter in\nwhat way he prepared it. And someone else, simi-\nlarly trying to use the milk, had no trouble for he\n3. For a brief review of these and other Chinese classical works\ncited here, see Huang (2000:116\u201346). Unless stated otherwise, all\nChinese characters are romanized according to the Pinyin system.\nThe characters for the Chinese words used are listed in the\nappendix.\n4. Human milk is an ingredient in a prescription in a silk manu-\nscript known as Prescriptions for Fifty-two Ailments discovered in\nHan tomb no. 3 at Mawangdui (Harper 1988:479).\n5. On the use of human milk as medicine in China, see Cooper\nand Sivin (1973:227\u201334).\n6. Harris (1985:130\u201331) describes the consternation of U.S. officials\nin the Food for Peace program in Brazil when confronted with com-\nplaints that the milk powder they were so generously distributing\ninduced cramps and diarrhea. Harris\u2019s remark that the Chinese\nloathe milk is, however, an exaggeration. Milk and milk products\nin moderation are well accepted in China, and ice cream is uni-\nversally popular. One of the favorite dishes that I encountered in\nNorthwest China in the fall of 1943 was creamed cauliflower (nai-\nyou caihua), which was available in country restaurants along the\nGansu panhandle.\n7. Again, with regard to cheese, \u201cSome can eat their fill of it without\nany unpleasant consequences and those whom it suits are won-\nderfully strengthened by it. On the other hand, there are some who\nhave difficulty in digesting it\u201d (p. 25).\ndigested it well, and had no hyperacidity, or eructa-\ntion, or gas, or weight in his hypochondrium.\nIt was only in the 1960s that the reason for this discrep-\nancy became known. Cow\u2019s milk contains about 5% lac-\ntose or milk sugar, a b-d-galactoside of glucose and the\nprincipal carbohydrate inmilk. As a disaccharide, lactose\nhas to be hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose before it\ncan be absorbed from the small intestine. The intestinal\nenzyme that hydrolyzes lactose is called lactase. All in-\nfant mammals produce liberal amounts of this enzyme,\nbut after weaning the level sharply declines, eventually\nbecoming so low that adults are no longer able to digest\nlactose\u2014a condition called hypolactasia, lactose intol-\nerance, or lactosemalabsorption.8 The undigested lactose\ncreates an osmotic load and draws large amounts ofwater\nfrom the body fluids into the intestine. It then passes\ninto the colon, where it is fermented by bacteria into\npropionic and butyric acids, methane, hydrogen, and car-\nbon dioxide. These conditions may cause stomach\ncramps and diarrhea and interfere with the absorption of\nother nutrients. In other words, adults are lactose-intol-\nerant (or lactase-deficient). This scenario is true for all\nmammals except humans, of whom a considerable pro-\nportion today are lactase-sufficient\u2014able to continue\nproducing lactase and utilizing lactose in the diet\nthroughout their adult lives.\nIt is now known that the occurrence of hypolactasia\nis genetically controlled.9 It cannot be reversed or ame-\nliorated by adaptation; if an individual is lacking in the\nlactase-persistence gene, he will lose the ability to pro-\nduce lactase as an adult no matter how vigorously and\nfor how long he continues to drink milk after weaning.\nExtensive population studies have shown that the prev-\nalence of hypolactasia is highest in East and Southeast\nAsia (85\u2013100%) and lowest in Northwest Europe, Aus-\ntralia, and New Zealand (! 10%). Intermediate values are\nfound for Central Europe (20\u201340%), Southern Europe\n(40\u201370%), the Middle East (24\u201380%), Africa (13\u201390%),\nand India (30\u201380%) (Sahi 1994b).10 If adult hypolactasia\nis the norm for all mammals, our earliest prehistoric\nancestors must also have been mostly lactose malabsor-\nbers as adults. How and when did the variations in hy-\npolactasia we see today arise? The generally accepted\nanswer to the \u201chow\u201d part of the question is the culture-\nhistorical hypothesis of Simoons (Simoons 1970a,\nMcCracken 1971, Johnson et al. 1974; see Sahi 1994b:\n8. The literature on hypolactasia is voluminous. For an excellent\noverview of the current state of the field, see Sahi 1994a, b).\n9. For a summary of the evidence, see Sahi (1994a:8\u20139). The long-\nheld view that hypolactasia can be corrected by adaptation (see Bray\n1984:5) is no longer tenable.\n10. The values vary widely among different population groups. In\nthe Middle East the occurrence of hypolactasia is only 24% among\nnomadic Bedouins but 75\u201380% among the Arabs of Israel, Jordan,\nLebanon, and Egypt. In Africa it may be as low as 13\u201317% among\nthe cattle-raising nomads of Beja in northeastern Sudan, theTuaregs\nin Niger, and the Fulani in Nigeria but as high as 70\u201390% in other\npopulations. In Pakistan and northern India it is 30%, but in south-\nern India and Sri Lanka it is 70%. Most of the field studies were\ncarried out using a hydrogen breath test to detect the presence of\nhypolactasia (see Flatz, Kuhnau, and Naftali 1984).\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 811\n10\u201311), which is based on the proposition thatwhenmilk\nis a significant part of the diet lactose absorbers will have\na better chance of survival and reproduction than those\nwho are lactose-intolerant.\nIn any large prehistoric population there would have\nbeen a few individuals who, through mutation or inher-\nitance, had retained the ability to digest lactose as adults.\nIf milk was a major part of the diet, such individuals\nwould have been able to use all the nutrients in milk\nwithout adverse effects. They would have been stronger\nand would have produced more offspring than their lac-\ntose-intolerant neighbors. In each generation the number\nof lactose absorbers would have increased, and in time,\nbarring other dietary changes, they would have become\nthe dominant group in the population. This is presum-\nably what happened in Northwest Europe. If milk was\nnot a major but still a significant part of the diet, the\nadvantage enjoyed by the lactose absorbers would have\nbeen less compelling, and the proportion of lactose ab-\nsorbers and nonabsorbers in the adult population would\nhave been more evenly balanced. This is the situation\nin many parts of the world. Finally, if milk was not a\nsignificant part of the diet and lactose absorbers enjoyed\nno advantage over those with hypolactasia, there would\nhave been no increase in the number of lactose absorbers\nin the population. This is what happened in East and\nSoutheast Asia and in West and Central Africa (Simoons\n1970b).11\nemergence of adult lactose absorbers\nIf the earliest prehistoric settlers in the world were vir-\ntually all lactose nonabsorbers, how could milk ever\nhave become a significant part of their diet so that se-\nlection in favor of lactose absorbers could get started? As\nfar as I can see, this was possible only in a situation in\nwhich milk was so abundant that its adoption as food\nwould have been highly beneficial not only to lactose\nabsorbers but also to the community as a whole. Such a\nunique situation, I submit, existed about 7000\u20138000 b.c.\namong the prehistoric pastoral tribes of the Fertile Cres-\ncent, who would have had herds of lactating animals,\nsuch as goats, ewes, and cows (and later camels), at their\ndisposal.12 They probably started off their pastoral life-\n11. For brief accounts of the origin of animal husbandry in the\nNeolithic see Fagan (1986:219\u201321), Bar-Yosef (1992:27\u201328), and\nHesse (1997). More detailed information on the evolution of food\nproduction systems and animal domestication may be found in\nRussell (1988), Bo\u00a8ko\u00a8nyi (1989), Ducos (1989), Hole (1989), Uerp-\nmann (1989), Roaf (1990:28\u201336), Gonen (1992), Budiansky (1992),\nCrabtree (1993), and Grigson (1995).\n12. The development of herding coupled with a nomadic lifestyle\nfrom 8000 to 6000 b.c. in the Fertile Crescent depended on the\nconfluence of two critical factors: the occurrence of wild ancestors\nof large herbivorous mammals amenable to domestication, such as\nsheep, goats, and cattle, and the availability of grasslands at dif-\nferent altitudes so that the herders had tomove their livestock from\nlower elevations to the highlands in the spring and vice versa in\nthe fall. This would have been an extension of the vertical trans-\nhumance practiced by their ancestral hunters and gatherers. See\nSmith (1995) in particular for an excellent account of animal do-\nmestication (pp. 25\u201333, 50\u201367) and the role of vertical transhu-\nstyle with animal flesh as the primary food, but once\nthey had learned the art of milking they would soon have\nrealized that they had a rich and renewable resource on\ntheir hands.13 They might have fed milk first to young\nchildren, who would have had no difficulty in digesting\nthe lactose and would have grown healthy and strong.\nThen they would have found that a few adults could also\ntolerate it. These fortunate individuals would have been\nencouraged to drink milk because it meant that they\nwould consume less meat, making more meat available\nto feed the rest of the population. This marked the point\nwhen the selection process in favor of lactose absorbers\nbegan to take off. Soon the art of milking would have\nbeen passed on to the early agricultural communities\nthat were sprouting contemporaneously adjacent to the\npasture lands that supported the lifestyle of the herders.\nThis process of selection, however, did not reach its\nlogical conclusion among all the pastoral peoples of the\nNear East and North Africa. Some time before the se-\nlection was complete, technology intervened. It was dis-\ncovered that if the milk were left to stand at above room\ntemperature it would soon turn sour, producing a variety\nof soured (or fermented) milk products. In fact, in the\nwarm summers of parts of the Near East the process is\nalmost inevitable. These secondary milk products have\ncome to be known variously as yogurt (from cow\u2019s or\newe\u2019s milk), koumiss (from mare\u2019s milk), or kefir (from\ncamel\u2019s milk). Furthermore, upon churning the fats in\nmilk or soured milk would separate to produce butter\nand butter oil.14 What is pertinent for us at this point is\nthat in the soured milk products the lactose has been\ndisarmed\u2014hydrolyzed into galactose and glucose and\nconverted into lactic acid, which is well tolerated by\nthose who cannot utilize lactose. For many years it was\nthought that lactose specifically enhanced the absorption\nof calcium (Harris 1985:140\u201342; Hui 1985:88). If so, lac-\ntose absorbers might still enjoy a significant advantage\nover nonabsorbers by drinking fresh milk rather than\nfermented milk. Recent work, however, has shown that\nthere is no solid evidence in support of this hypothesis\n(Simoons 2001:8\u201312). For practical purposes, therefore,\nmance in the domestication of caprines in the Zagros Mountains\nin about 7000 b.c. (pp. 51, 84, and 89).\n13. Russell (1988) has made extensive calculations of the caloric\nyields of various early strategies of food production in the Near\nEast: harvesting wild cereals, cultivating wheat or barley, keeping\nherds of goats, sheep, and cattle for meat only, and keeping the\nsame herds for both meat and milk. He found that a herd of animals\nkept for meat plus milk yielded more than twice as many calories\nas one kept for meat only. In fact, the caloric yield of a meat-plus-\nmilk strategy would have been almost as high as that of the cul-\ntivation of wheat or barley. This suggests that a system utilizing\nboth agriculture and animal husbandry would have been a highly\nattractive option under the environmental conditions in the Near\nEast during the early Neolithic (see Grigson 1995).\n14. For a discussion of luo (soured milk or yogurt), su (butter). tihu\n(butter oil), and rufu (cottage cheese), see Huang (2000:248\u201357) and\nSabban (1986).\n812 F current anthropology\nthe soured milks are as nutritious as fresh milk itself.15\nThus, with the emergence of fermented milk products\nthe advantage enjoyed by lactose absorbers would have\nbeen greatly reduced and the selection pressure in favor\nof lactose-tolerant individuals virtually eliminated.\nWhen this happened, lactase-deficient individuals would\nhave continued to exist even among descendants of herd-\ners who could trace their ancestry to the pioneering no-\nmadic pastoralists of the Neolithic. At the same time,\nlactose nonabsorbers could, if conditions were favorable,\nsuddenly adopt soured milk products as a major food\nresource and become successful nomadic herders. Pre-\nsumably this is what happened in the steppes of North-\neast Asia during the 1st millennium b.c.\nSurprisingly, it is in the populations of Northwest Eu-\nrope that we find the most successful process in favor of\nthe selection of lactose absorbers. The extraordinarily\nlow incidence of hypolactasia in Northwest Europe is, I\nsuspect, the result of a unique set of circumstances.\nWhen agriculture and animal husbandry reached North-\nwest Europe during the Neolithic, it was animal hus-\nbandry, including dairy culture, that first took root. The\nregionwas damp, cloudy, and cold. The staple crops, such\nas wheat and barley, selected in the warm, sunny,\nsemiarid Near East would have done poorly there until\nnew varieties (or new crops) better adapted to the pre-\nvailing conditions were developed. At the same time,\nthere was plenty of rich pasture available to feed herd\nanimals, and animal flesh and milk soon became the\nmost important sources of food. It appears that in these\ncircumstances the overall nutritional advantages that ac-\ncrue to lactose absorbers were even more compelling\nthan those we have seen among the nomadic pastoralists\nof the Near East.16\nIt has been postulated that the extraordinary selective\nadvantage enjoyed by lactose absorbers over nonabsor-\nbers in Northwest Europe is linked to the absorption of\ncalcium (Flatz and Rottauwe 1973; Flatz 1987:56\u201359). In\na climate that provided only a low level of sunshine,\npelvic deformity, rickets, and osteomalacia are presumed\nto have been common ailments because of the lack of\nvitamin D and the poor absorption of calcium. Those\nwho could not tolerate milk would have consumed less\ndietary calcium than those who could. As a result, lac-\n15. The free energy of glucose and galactose is 686 kcal\/mole and\nthat of lactic acid 639 kcal\/mole; thus there is a loss of 47 kcal\/\nmole or 7% of the free energy in the lactose in the conversion. This\nloss is minor. There is no loss in the value of the other constituents\nof milk, proteins, fats, and vitamins. On the assumption that in\nthe Near East soured milk was discovered soon after the start of\nthe harvesting of milk from lactating animals, Russell (1988:32) has\nconcluded that hypolactasia has had only a minor effect on the\nevolution of dairy farming as a component of animal husbandry.\nSherratt (1981), in contrast, argues that soured milk was not widely\nused until the 4th millennium b.c., in which case hypolactasia\ncould have had a significant effect on the point at which a tribe\ncould be persuaded to adopt dairy farming.\n16. For example, among the nomadic Bedouins in Jordan, descen-\ndants of the original nomadic pastoralists of the Near East, the\nincidence of hypolactasia is still about 24%, considerably higher\nthan the 4% in Denmark and 5% in Great Britain (see Sahi 1994b:\n12, 15).\ntose absorbers would have enjoyed much better health\nand reproduced more successfully than nonabsorbers.\nThis calcium-absorption hypothesis has been well re-\nceived among anthropologists (see, e.g., Harris 1985:\n142\u201348; Durham 1991:254\u201385), but it is apparently not\nsupported by historical, osteoarchaeological, or biomed-\nical evidence (Simoons 2001:12\u201345). Be that as it may, it\nis possible that the cool climatemay have favored lactose\nabsorbers in another way. Under cool conditions milk\nwould have kept longer and souredmilks would not have\noccurred spontaneously; the art of making them would\nhave to have been transmitted from the Near East at a\nlater date. Consequently, in Northwest Europe the se-\nlection process was able to continue long enough to en-\nable lactose intolerance to reach the lowest level known.\nFor the people of Northwest Europe the integration of\nanimal husbandry in general and dairy farming in par-\nticular with grain production thus made excellent eco-\nnomic as well as nutritional sense.17\nAs to when these variations arose, we can only spec-\nulate. Calculations on the time it took for the observed\nvariations to emerge based on various values of selection\npower suggest that we are dealing with time spans in\nthe range of 3,000\u20135,000 years.18 In the Near East, the\nselection process presumably started shortly after hu-\nmans first learned to rear herds of lactating mammals\n(ca. 7000\u20139000 b.c.) and ceased there when civilized so-\ncieties with established systems of agriculture and ani-\nmal husbandry made their appearance (ca. about 3000\nb.c.) in Sumer and Egypt. The intervention of soured\nmilk products probably occurred about halfway between\nthese two events (ca. 4000 b.c.). In Northwest Europe,\nthe selection process probably started when the practice\nof animal husbandry was first transmitted from theNear\nEast (ca. 6000 b.c.) and ceased when the art of making\nsoured milk products became a stable part of the food\nproduction system (ca. 2000 b.c.).\nthe situation in china\nIn the case of prehistoric China the situation appears to\nhave been just the opposite of that of the Fertile Crescent\nand Northwest Europe. There is no indication that lac-\ntating herd animals or dairy products constituted the\nprimary food resource for a significant portion of the\npopulation of China at any time during the Neolithic\nperiod. In the early communities of the wetlands along\nthe Yangtze and the loess plateau carved by the Yellow\n17. The proximity of their lifestyle to dairy farming and cattle herd-\ning may have conferred yet another advantage on the Northwest\nEuropeans. Indications are that since antiquity common cattle have\nbeen important in spreading tuberculosis among humans. If so, the\nNorthwest Europeans would have developed a greater resistance to\ntuberculosis than their eastern and southern neighbors (see Haas\nand Haas 1995). I thank F. J. Simoons for drawing my attention to\nthis possibility.\n18. It has been estimated that with a selection power of 5% itwould\nrequire from 160 to 250 generations (3,000\u20135,000 years) to reach\nthe low level of hypolactasia seen in Northwest Europe. A stronger\nselection power, 5\u20137%, would require a shorter selection period\n(see Flatz 1987:59\u201360; Sahi 1994b:11; Simoons 2001:46).\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 813\nRiver, the environment was far less conducive to the rise\nof a pastoral economy than that which prevailed in the\nFertile Crescent.19 Excavations at the Hubei Basin and\nHangzhou Bay in the south (9000\u20134000 b.c.) and the Pei-\nligang and Yangshao sites in the north (6000\u20134000 b.c.)\nshow that the earliest domesticated animals were the\ndog, pig, chicken, and water buffalo (Smith 1995:125,\n138\u201339).20 Sheep, goat, and cattle made their appearance\nin small numbers only after 5000 b.c. (Chang 1986:113,\n160, 217; Guo, Li, and Zheng 1999:396\u201397). It is not\nknown whether these early lactating mammals were\nwild or domesticated. The prevailing food production\nsystem appears to have been based on agriculture, sup-\nplemented by limited animal rearing, hunting, gathering,\nand fishing. It is not until the Shang Dynasty (ca.\n1520\u20131030 b.c.) that we see, through archaeological ex-\ncavations in the Shang heartland in southern Henan and\noracle-bone inscriptions, evidence of the occurrence\nof large herds of cattle or sheep (Chang 1980:143).21\nThroughout the long prehistoric period calciumwas pre-\nsumably supplied by the wealth of green leafy vegetables\ncultivated or collected from the wild.22 There was always\nplenty of sunshine to allow the synthesis of vitamin D\nneeded for the utilization of dietary calcium. There\nwould have been little selection pressure for lactose ab-\nsorbers against nonabsorbers even if milk had been freely\navailable. As a result, the adult population during the\nShang Dynasty was probably as firmly lactase-deficient\nas it had been at the dawn of the agricultural revolution\n7,000\u20138,000 years earlier.\nAnimal husbandry in the sense of the rearing of cattle\nand sheep presumably reached its highest expression in\n19. In Smith\u2019s (1995) account of the emergence of agriculture there\nis a striking contrast between the wealth of information on the\ndomestication of large mammals in the Fertile Crescent and the\npaucity of such information in the Yangtze and YellowRiver valleys\nin China. The former runs to 16 pages (pp. 53\u201367, 88\u201389) while the\nlatter consists of scattered statements that take up less than a page.\nFurthermore, hunting and fishing remained significant sources of\nfood until the middle of the 1st millennium b.c. (see Huang 2000:\n60, 61\u201363).\n20. For information obtained from specific sites and pertinent Chi-\nnese sources see Chang (1986:59, 113, 160, 211, 217, 270, 279, 282)\nand An (1989). For more recent information on the origin of rice\ncultivation see Yan (1997).\n21. Chang notes the numbers of cattle used in burial rituals: \u201c1,000\ncattle in one ritual once, 500 once, 400 once, 300 thrice, 100 nine\ntimes, and so on.\u201d These numbers are much larger than those re-\nportedly used on ritual occasions in Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey,\nbut they pale into insignificance when compared with those em-\nployed by another people in Southwest Asia in the 10th century\nb.c. In Kings I (8.63) we read that Solomon and all Israel with him\noffered to the Lord 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. If this statement\nis true, the world has probably not seen a ceremonial bloodbath of\nanimals of this scale ever since.\n22. In the absence of dairy foods, the diet was nevertheless probably\nlow in calcium by Western standards (see, e.g., Latourette 1957:\n567; Koo 1976:130). A comprehensive nutritional survey carried out\nin the late 1980s showed that active healthy males in the Chinese\ncountryside consumed only an average of 544 mg\/day of calcium\nas compared with 1,143 mg\/day for the equivalent group in the\nUnited States (Chen et al. 1990:50, table 5.5). Evidently, by adapting\nto a smaller bone structure, height, and weight, the Chinese are\nable to maintain health with a lesser amount of calcium intake.\nthe northern heartland of Chinese civilization during the\nShang and early Zhou. Even then it was by no means\nthe predominant component of the food production sys-\ntem (Chang 1980:136\u201349, 214\u201315; R. Huang 1988:7).\nDairy farming could have been attempted, but since\nmore than nine out of ten adults who tried to drink milk\nwould have experienced unpleasant effects and alterna-\ntive sources of food were plentiful, it would have re-\nmained an esoteric activity practiced on a limited scale.\nApparently animal husbandry was also important to the\nlivelihood of the ancestors of the Zhou people who con-\nquered the Shang and founded the Zhou Dynasty\n(1030\u2013221 b.c.). In fact, the Shiji tells us that the proto-\nZhou clan had at one time pursued a pastoral lifestyle\namong the Rong and Di tribes to the northwest and north\nbefore they returned to the practice of agriculture in their\ntraditional homeland along the Wei and Jing Rivers in\neastern Shaanxi.23 As indicated by numerous references\nin the Shijing (Book of Odes) (see Waley 1960[1937]: nos.\n100, 160, 161, 195, 199, 220, 238), an anthology of folk\nsongs and ceremonial odes collected between 1100 and\n600 b.c., cattle and sheep herding continued to be a sig-\nnificant part of the economy during the Western Zhou\n(1030\u2013722 b.c.).24 Furthermore, according to the early\nHan Dynasty Zhouli (The Rites of the Zhou), horses,\ncattle, and sheep were mentioned as the principal live-\nstock in six of the nine provinces of Zhou China (\u201cZhi\nfangzhi,\u201d pp. 344\u201350; see Huang 2000:21). But without\ndairy products as a renewable food resource, the herding\nof cattle and sheep just for their meat was an expensive\nstrategy that could not be sustained in the face of a rising\npopulation and mounting demands of land for agricul-\nture. According to the Erya (Literary Expositor), ca. a.d.\n300, new fields were constantly being cleared for grain\nproduction.25 During the early Zhou years the Rong and\nthe Di were gradually absorbed into the Chinese eco-\nnomic and political sphere and became farmers instead\nof herders.26 As a result, the land available for pasturage\n23. The Shiji, dated at about 90 b.c., relates the history of the\nChinese people from the legendary Yellow Emperor until the early\nyears of the Han Dynasty. Chapter 4, \u201cHistory of the Zhou,\u201d states\nthat Bu Ku, son of Hou Ji, founder of the Zhou tribe, abandoned\nthe practice of agriculture and led his people to live among the\nnorthern pastoral barbarians known as Rong and Di. Later his de-\nscendant Gong Liu brought his people back to a settled agricultural\nlife. These events probably took place during the middle centuries\nof the 2d millennium b.c. The significance of this account and the\ninfluence of the northern tribes on the ascendance of Zhou culture\nare discussed by Hsu and Linduff (1988:34\u201335, 50\u201359, 64\u201367).\n24. Particularly pertinent are the following lines from no. 160:\n\u201cWho says you have no sheep?\/Three hundred is the flock.\/Who\nsays you have no cattle?\/ Ninety are the black-lips.\/Here your rams\ncome,\/Their horns thronging;\/Here your cattle come,\/Their ears\nflapping.\u201d\n25. The Erya (9:22b) shows that fields recently brought into pro-\nduction were called by different names; one-year-old fields were zi,\ntwo-year-old fields xin, and three-year-old fields yu. All three types\nare mentioned in the Shijing (Waley 1960 [1937]: nos. 134, 154).\nNew fields were created by either clearing virgin forests or plough-\ning pasture land.\n26. The region occupied by the Rong and the Di\u2014northern Shaanxi\nand central Shanxi\u2014is thought of as a seesaw zone in which\nusage by pastoralists and by farmers fluctuated (Hsu and Linduff\n1988:50).\n814 F current anthropology\nbegan to shrink, as did the size of herds of sheep and\ncattle and the amount of meat harvested from them.27\nThe typical Chinese style of agriculture, which stresses\ngrain production and deemphasizes the rearing of lac-\ntating mammals, gradually established itself as the dom-\ninant mode of food production.\nthe nomadic warriors of the east asian\nsteppes\nEven as the system of intensive agriculture encroached\non the land formerly available for pasture in the Zhou\nheartland in the first half of the 1st millennium b.c., it\nwas expanding and achieving consolidation among the\nvassal states to the east and south. Its spread farther\nnorth was halted by the great Eurasian steppes, which\nwere unsuitable for supporting an agricultural economy.\nIn the latter part of themillennium, the local inhabitants\nwithin and along the margin of the Asian steppe, \u201cwhich\nuntil this time had been neither exclusively agricultural\nnor exclusively pastoral, began to take up for good an\nunmistakable pastoral steppe nomadism\u201d (Lattimore\n1988[1940]:63)28 and soon formed a formidable national\nentity (Chang 1977:390\u201397). This new nomadic nation\nwas distinguished from that of the Zhou Chinese in two\nimportant respects. First, its economy was based on a\nspecialized technique of horse usage which enabled\nmounted warriors to move large herds of horses, cattle,\nand sheep rapidly in search of new pastures across the\nsteppes. This gave the herders a degree of mobility and\na geographical range of operation far beyond that enjoyed\nby the Rong and the Di. Secondly, its people had adopted\nthe milk of horses, cattle, and sheep as their major food\nresource. Thus, the steppe nomads known to theChinese\nas Xiongnu (or Hsiungnu)29 became virtually indepen-\ndent of settled farming to meet their need for food. By\nthe start of the Han Dynasty (202 b.c.\u2013a.d. 220) they had\nachieved such a high degree of economic, political, and\nmilitary power that they posed a serious threat to the\nnewly established Chinese empire.\nHow did the Xiongnu, in contrast to their Chinese\nneighbors, come to adopt milk as their primary food re-\nsource? Chinese tradition holds that they were ethni-\n27. I would not, however, go so far as Eberhard (1971:155), who says\nthat \u201cbetween 400 and 100 b.c. the meat-eating Chinese reduced\ntheir meat intake greatly, gave up eating beef and mutton and\nchanged over to pork and dog meat.\u201d While it is likely that the\nShang and early Zhou Chinese ate more beef and mutton than their\ndescendants of the late Zhou (500\u2013220 b.c.), they could hardly be\ncharacterized as a basically meat-eating people. Nor can it be said\nthat they substituted pork and dog flesh for beef and mutton at that\ntime. Pigs and dogs had been raised for meat at least since 6000\nb.c. (Chang 1986:91).\n28. The passage continues, \u201cThey established a sphere of activity\nof their own, eccentric to the sphere of civilized society in China.\u201d\nThis may also mean that within this sphere farmers and herders\ncoexisted and complemented each other\u2019s activity.\n29. But called Huns by some scholars in the West (see e.g., Pulley-\nblank 1983:451; Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi, and Piazza 1994:201, 224;\nLubo-Lesnichenko 1989:50 [\u201cthe Huns stemmed basically from the\nSiberian branch of the Mongoloid race\u201d]). There is, however, no\ndirect evidence to relate the Xiongnu of 200 b.c. in East Asia to\nthe Huns of Europe in a.d. 400 (Thompson 1999:1).\ncally not very different from the Rong-Di or the Chinese\n(Lattimore 1988[1940]:56, 342).30 In fact, the Shiji\n(110.2879; Watson 1961:155) states that they were de-\nscendants of the rulers of the legendary Xia Dynasty\n(2000\u20131520 b.c.) and that even \u201cas early as the time of\nEmperors Yao and Shun [i.e., preceding the Xia Dynasty]\nand before, we hear of these people [i.e., ancestors of the\nXiongnu] . . . living in the region of the northern bar-\nbarians andwandering from place to place pasturing their\nanimals.\u201d This means that in the 2d millennium b.c. the\nproto-Xiongnu tribes would have lived for generations in\nclose proximity to the Rong and the Di. If so, could the\nutilization of milk as food have been transmitted from\nthe Rong and the Di to the proto-Xiongnu? The Liji (Rec-\nord of Rites) says that the Rong and the Di wore skins\nof animals and \u201csome of them did not eat grain-food\u201d\n(p. 230; Legge 1885:229, cited by Chang 1977:42),31which\nwould suggest that most of them ate meat with grains\nas a supplement. Perhaps more informative is a passage\nabout the food habits of the northern barbarians from\nthe Huangdi neijing suwen (Yellow Emperor\u2019s Manual\nof Internal Medicine, Questions and Answers), a com-\nposite work that reached its present form in the 2d cen-\ntury b.c.: \u201cIn the North, natural resources tend to lie\nhidden. The terrain is mountainous and the weather\nmarked by biting winds, frost, and ice. The people find\npleasure in living in the wilderness and consume milk\nas their primary food [my emphasis].32 As a result cold-\nness often descends into their organs and causes dis-\ntended bellies [my emphasis].33 These illnesses are best\n30. Pru\u02das\u02c7ek (1971:209\u201328) also maintains that the Rong and the Di\nwere ethnically and linguistically no different from the Zhou Chi-\nnese. Furthermore, they may well be related to the Xiongnu and\nother nomadic peoples that the Chinese were to encounter from\n300 b.c. on in the Asian steppes.\n31. \u201cThose on the west were called Rong (Jung). They had their\nhair unbound, and wore skins. Some of them did not eat grain-food\n[my emphasis]. Those on the north were called Di (Ti). They wore\nskins of animals and birds, and dwelt in caves. Some of them did\nnot eat grain-food [my emphasis].\u201d Most scholars agree that by the\nstart of the Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013480 b.c.) the Rong and\nthe Di had already become largely settled farmers (Hsu and Linduff\n1988:50; Pru\u02das\u02c7ek 1971:217; Pulleyblank 1984:447).Wemay therefore\ninfer that these statements refer to the condition of these tribes at\nan earlier time, well before the founding of the ZhouDynasty (1030\nb.c.).\n32. In the original, ru shi. Literally, ru is \u201cmilk\u201d and shi is \u201cto eat\u201d\nor \u201cfood\u201d (i.e., the stuff that is eaten). Veith translates ru shi as\n\u201clive on milk products,\u201d but in this context it is preferably trans-\nlated as \u201cdrink milk\u201d or \u201cuse milk as a primary food.\u201d Although\nthe Huangdi neijing suwen was compiled in about the 2d century\nb.c., much of the material could have existed at an earlier time,\npossibly in very early Zhou or late Shang times.\n33. The original reads zang han sheng man bing, and Veith trans-\nlates it as \u201cThe extreme cold causes many illnesses.\u201d The com-\nmentary by Zhang Jingyue (ca. a.d. 1563\u20131640\u0001), a well-known\nphysician and commentator on the Huangdi neijing suwen, says,\n\u201cThe land is cold, so is the character of milk. Therefore, coldness\nsettles in the internal organs. Elimination is retarded and the belly\nbecomes distended.\u201d The illness as described fits in well with a\ncondition of hypolactasia. Such a condition would not have oc-\ncurred if the milk had been processed to remove the lactose. The\nstatement suggests that the Zhou people knew that milk could\ncause ailments in the digestive system.\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 815\ntreated with acupuncture and moxibustion\u201d (12.107; my\ntranslation, based in part on Veith 1972 [1949]:147\u201348).\nThis passage suggests that during the late Shang and\nearly Zhou (ca. 1200\u20131000 b.c.) some of the northern\npastoral peoples had acquired such large herds of lactat-\ning mammals that they had begun to consume milk as\na major food, but they were all lactose nonabsorbers and\nsuffered from the typical symptoms of hypolactasia. The\nnorthern barbarians apparently included the Rong and\nthe Di as well as the proto-Xiongnu. We presume the\nRong and the Di abandoned the use of milk as food when\nthey realized that the adverse effects they endured were\ndue to the ingestion of milk. In time they were absorbed\ninto the Chinese agricultural system. The Zhou Chinese\nwere evidently aware of the fact that ingestion of sub-\nstantial amounts of milk could cause stomach ailments.\nThis awareness undoubtedly served as a deterrent to the\nestablishment of dairy farming as a significant compo-\nnent of their food production system.\nBut what happened to the proto-Xiongnu who lived at\nthe margin of the steppes? Their descendants became\npart-herders and part-farmers and remained outside the\nChinese sphere of influence. They could have discontin-\nued the use of milk as food and gone back to a diet of\nmeat supplemented by grains.34 This would mean that\njust before their transformation into nomadic warriors,\nthe proto-Xiongnu people were still lactose nonabsor-\nbers. Alternatively, they could have continued the in-\ngestion of milk and maintained a process of selection in\nfavor of lactose absorbers that could have started at about\n1500 b.c.35 This, however, would have provided only\nabout 1,000 years for the selection process, hardly ade-\nquate to allow the emergence of a Xiongnu population\nthat was largely free from hypolactasia. Thus we are\nforced to conclude that at about 300\u2013400 b.c. the people\nliving on the steppes bordering China, who were on the\nverge of adopting milk as their primary food resource,\nwere lactose nonabsorbers. This is possible only if what\nthe Xiongnu consumedwas notmilk itself but fermented\nmilk products in which lactose had been converted to\nlactic acid or alcohol. Indeed, we find that according to\nthe Shiji (110:2899) and the Qian Hanshu (94:3759) what\nthe Xiongnu consumed was not milk (ru) itself but a\nfermented form of it, known as luo, which is a type of\nsoured milk or yogurt.36\n34. Indeed, in describing the habits of the ancestors of the Xiongnu,\nthe Shiji (p. 2879) says, \u201cEveryone ate the meat of the domestic\nanimals and wore clothes of hide or wraps made of felt or fur.\u201d No\nmilk is mentioned. This suggests that most of the proto-Xiongnu\ndid not consume milk.\n35. On the basis of the information summarized in Guo, Li, and\nCheng (1999:396\u201397, 407\u20138), we can say that large herds of cattle\nor sheep probably did not exist in East Asia before 1500 b.c. and\ncertainly did not before 2000 b.c.\n36. The product is called dong luo, which Watson (1961:170) trans-\nlates as \u201cmilk and koumiss\u201d and Lattimore (1988[1940]:488) as\n\u201cmilk and milk products.\u201d I think that dong luo is more accurately\ninterpreted as \u201ca luo prepared from milk,\u201d since in ancient China\nluo could mean an alcoholic drink or soup prepared from grains,\nfruits, or milk. The Hou Hanshu (History of the Later HanDynasty)\n(90.1979), however, tells us that the Wu Huan, a pastoral tribe that\nsucceeded the Xiongnu, \u201ceat meat and drink luo,\u201d indicating that\nHow did the Xiongnu acquire the technology of mak-\ning and utilizing fermented milk products? There are\nonly two possibilities: either they developed it them-\nselves or they learned it from others. The suddenness\nwith which they appeared on the scene as nomads de-\npendent on milk as their principal food resource suggests\nthat they had acquired the technology by transmission.\nFurthermore, at about the same time they had also ac-\nquired another technology critical to the success of their\nlifestyle, that of mounted horsemanship. It seems likely\nthat both technologies had been transmitted to the proto-\nXiongnu in the latter part of the 1st millennium b.c. by\nthe Scythians and Sakians, the first nomadic societies in\nthe western sector of the great Eurasian steppes and the\ndominant powers of the region from the 8th to the 3d\ncentury b.c. (Chang 1977:396; Pavlinskaya 1989). The\nScythians were skilled horse riders. According to Herod-\notus (1983:128) they drank milk, and it is reasonable to\nassume that they knew the art of making fermented\ndairy foods.37\nWhat was true of the Xiongnu during the Han Dynasty\nwas very probably also true of their nomadic successors,\nthe Xianbei, the Tuoba, the Qidan, and the Mongols of\nlater eras, who invaded China and established short-lived\ndynasties within the Great Wall. All these nomadic\nnations were lactose nonabsorbers but were able to util-\nize milk because they had learned to improve its di-\ngestibility by fermentation. This hypothesis is borne out\nby the observation that among themodernMongols,who\nare direct descendants of the ancient nomads of the East\nAsian steppes, the prevalence of hypolactasia is as high\nas 88%, virtually the same as that for Chinese (Sahi\n1994b, Wang et al. 1984, Zheng et al. 1988).38 This is not\nsurprising, since consuming mainly fermented milk\nproducts greatly reduced the selection pressure in favor\nof the ability to metabolize lactose.\nThe above scenario is in agreement with the thesis\nthat, in contrast to the situation in the Fertile Crescent,\nthe emergence of these aggressive East Asian mounted\nnomads was a rather late historical development, prob-\nably contemporaneous with the formalization of the in-\ntensive agricultural system in northern China during the\nEastern Zhou Dynasty (722\u2013221 b.c.) (see Lattimore\n1988[1940]:340\u201365). There was neither the time nor the\nselection pressure for a lactase-sufficient population to\nevolve.\nluo and not milk is the principal drink. For further discussion see\nHuang (2000:253).\n37. The statement actually applied to the Massagetes, which may\nbe just another name for the Scythians (Cavalli-Sforza, Menozzi,\nand Piazza 1994:201). There is no specific record that the Scythians\nmade fermented milk products, but in view of their proximity to\nthe Near East, where dairy farming originated 7,000 years earlier,\nthis seems a reasonable assumption.\n38. U. S. diplomats and Peace Corp volunteers who have recently\nlived in Mongolia report that the modern Mongolians consume\nmainly yogurt and lactic cheeses and not much fresh milk.\n816 F current anthropology\ndairy foods and the chinese diet\nThis then brings us to our second question: Why did the\nChinese fail to incorporate milk and milk products into\ntheir food system? Actually, the question is itself based\non a misconception. When we study the historical lit-\nerature we find that milk, in the form of luo, was, in\nfact, significant in the diet of the ruling classes in north-\nern China from the Han until the end of the Yuan (Mon-\ngol) Dynasty (ca. 202 b.c.\u2013a.d. 1368) (Huang 2000:\n250\u201353). Indeed, the Shiming (Expositor of Names) in the\nearly 2d century a.d. states (13:8b) that \u201cluo is prepared\nfrom milk juice; it makes one fat.\u201d Furthermore, there\nwas a prefect of mare milkers at the Han court whose\nduty it was to collect mare\u2019s milk and process it into a\nmare\u2019s-milk wine (Qian Hanshu, 79:7a, cited in Bielen-\nstein 1980:34).39 The making of yogurt (luo), butter (su),\nand soft cheeses (ganluo) from cow\u2019s milk is described\nin detail in the celebrated agricultural compendium\nQimin yaoshu (Important Arts for the Peoples\u2019 Welfare)\nof a.d. 544. Luo and other dairy products are mentioned\nin the Tang Dynasty (a.d. 618\u2013906) pharmacopoeia Xin\nxiu bencao (pp. 170\u201371) and the Song Dynasty (a.d.\n960\u20131279) Zhenglei bencao. It is also clear, however, that\nalthough for more than a thousand years milk products\nwere a significant component of the diet of upper-class\nNorthern Chinese, they never became an integral part\nof the diet of the common people. As a result, dairy farm-\ning remained a peripheral component of the food pro-\nduction system. The main reason for this situation was\nprobably economic. On good agricultural land, animal\nhusbandry involving lactating animals, even with milk\nas a secondary product, could not compete with agri-\nculture in terms of productivity.40 Thus milk, like beef\nand lamb, always remained an expensive commodity,\naffordable only occasionally if at all by the general pop-\nulation. A second reason was gastronomic. The flavor of\nsoured milk is not one that everyone finds immediately\nappealing; it is an acquired taste that may require a con-\nsiderable amount of time to develop. There is a well-\nknown 6th-century story which relates that when the\nsouthern official Wang Hsu first arrived at the Northern\nWei (Tuoba) court, he would at first drink only tea, since\nhe could not bear the taste of yogurt as a drink (luojiang).\nIt was only after several years of acclimatization that he\naccepted it, though in time he liked it so well that he\neven considered it superior to tea and called tea \u201cyogurt\u2019s\nslave\u201d (luonu) (Huang 2000:511).\nAfter the departure of the Mongols in a.d. 1368, milk\nproducts lapsed into obscurity on the Chinese dietary\nscene. Nationalism has often been cited as a primary\ncause of this apparent decline in interest in dairy foods\n(Anderson 1987:66), but the main reasons may have been\n39. Wine from milk (ru jiu) was celebrated in a poem by the famous\nTang poet Du Fu (Huang 2000:248 n. 56).\n40. Hsu (1991:44) compares the productivity of a piece of land used\nin intensive agriculture in China with that of a piece used as pasture\nfor animal husbandry, including dairy farming, and reports that the\nnumber of calories produced in agriculture is nine times that pro-\nduced in animal husbandry.\nsimply economic and gastronomic. As the population\nincreased, dairy farming, already on a shaky economic\nbase, became less and less cost-effective except in areas\nwhere intensive agriculture could not be maintained.\nAnother reason is the commercialization, in the late\nTang and Song Dynasties, of doufu and other processed\nsoyfoods which provided the key nutrients, such as cal-\ncium and proteins, formerly supplied by milk products.\nMoreover, as the center of culinary culturemoved south-\nward, writers on matters related to food also became less\nand less informed on the use of milk and milk products\nin the diet. Dairy products received little attention and\ndid not reappear in the food literature until they were\nintroduced again from the West in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies.\nThat the main barrier to the adoption ofmilk and dairy\nproducts in the Chinese diet was economic is borne out\nby the rapid rise in the production and consumption of\ndairy foods in China in the past 20 years (Wilkinson\n2001). This rise is commensurate with the rise in the\nstandard of living of the populace. In 1979 the total pro-\nduction of milk was 100,000 tons. In 2000 it was nearly\n7 million tons, yielding a per capita consumption of\nnearly 6.9 kg (compared with 260\u2013330 kg for North\nAmerica and Europe), which is still only one-fifteenth of\nthe world average. Milk is consumed in the form of fluid\nmilk,milk powder, yogurt, and ice cream. The popularity\nof yogurt indicates that the gastronomic gap could be\neasily overcome.41\nThe effect of hypolactasia on the utilization of milk\nmay also help to explain another puzzle in the history\nof the development of processed foods in China. Soybean\nhas been processed into soymilk since the Eastern Han\nDynasty (a.d. 25\u2013220), and doufu has been widely made\nfrom it and used since the late Tang, yet nowhere in the\nChinese literature before 1800 is there any mention of\nthe consumption of soymilk itself. The reason is now\nclear. In addition to sucrose, the soybean contains two\na-D-galactosides, raffinose (a trisaccharide) and stachy-\nose (a tetrasaccharide). The human digestive system\nlacks enzymes that can hydrolyze either of these sugars.\nThe effect of the ingestion of these unusual sugars would\nbe similar to that seen after the ingestion of lactose. The\nChinese no doubt soon found out that soymilk could be\ninjurious to one\u2019s health while the curds prepared from\nit were easily digestible. It was not until the late Qing\nDynasty, when it was found that prolonged heating of\nthe milk improved its digestibility, that soymilk became\nan accepted item of the food system (Huang 2000:\n322\u201323). It is now widely consumed as a breakfast food\nthroughout China.\n41. On a trip through northern Fujian, southeastern China, in Oc-\ntober 2001, I found milk being served as a drink at dinner in res-\ntaurants in Fuzhou, Wuyi, Shaowu, Gutian, and Hetang, and in\nShaowu, a town with a population of 130,000, some of my fellow\ndiners ordered yogurt. Apparently, the gastronomic barrier had long\nbeen breached. The consumption level is still rather low. If this\ntrend continues, it will be interesting to see when hypolactasia\nbecomes noticeable.\nVolume 43, Number 5, December 2002 F 817\nappendix: chinese characters for words used\nReferences Cited\na n z h i m i n . 1989. \u201cPrehistoric agriculture in China,\u201d in Forag-\ning and farming: The evolution of plant exploitation.
