A version of the model with two productivity types predicts that inflation is a\nregressive form of taxation.\nTo study the distributional effects of inflation, it is useful to have an environment with\nprivate information about agents\u2019 types. Under complete information the results may be\nbiased because an agent\u2019s type generally affects his terms of trade and hence the incentives for\nholding money. Most models in the monetary-search literature assume complete information\nabout all the payoff relevant variables, e.g. productivity, preferences, or money holdings, to\nallow the terms of trade to be determined through bargaining (see Trejos and Wright (1995)\nand Shi (1995)). Since bilateral matching is typically assumed (Kiyotaki and Wright (1993)),\nbargaining is a natural allocation mechanism.\nTo deal with private information we model decentralized trade in a different way. In each\nperiod every agent who wants to consume (a buyer) visits at random one of the agents who\ncan produce (a seller).1 This results in stochastic demand at a given seller\u2019s location. We\nfix the supply of each seller at a single indivisible good in order to use auctions to determine\nthe allocation. The number of sellers in the market is determined by a free entry condition.\nAnonymity makes fiat money essential for trade in these meetings. We embed this framework\nin the environment of Lagos and Wright (2005), henceforth LW.\nWe assume that the good is allocated according to a second-price auction.2 This mech-\nanism lends itself to the natural interpretation of intra-buyer competition for the good: the\nbuyers who visit the same seller bid up the price, as in an ascending bid auction whose out-\ncome is identical to a second-price auction. The result is that the buyer with most money\npurchases the good and the price he pays is equal to the second highest money holdings in\nthe match. Stochastic demand conditions at a given location lead to uncertainty for buyers\nabout the market-clearing price. As a result, buyers face a non-trivial choice of liquidity since\nthe good can occasionally be purchased with little money.3\nOur first set of results concern the case where agents are homogeneous. We show that in\nthe unique equilibrium, despite homogeneity, buyers bring different amounts of money to the\nsearch market and we derive the closed-form solution for the distribution of money holdings.\n1A similar matching process is proposed in Goldberg (2007). Our framework does not suffer from the\ncriticism that models in which buyers do not know where to purchase their desired good are not conducive\nto the study of monetary exchange (Howitt (2005)). The same criticism is dealt with in Corbae, Temzelides\nand Wright (2003) where matching is explicitly directed.\n2Julien, Kennes and King (in press) consider second-price auctions in a setting with indivisible money\nand Green and Zhou (2002) use double auctions in bilateral matches. Camera and Selcuk (2005) develop a\nnon-monetary model where the trading price depends on the stochastic number of buyers that a seller faces.\n3More generally, in order to clear the market, prices need to adjust to realized demand conditions at each\nlocation. We propose the lowest price such that demand equals supply (for a similar interpretation of auctions\nsee Demange, Gale and Sotomayor (1986)). In the conclusions we discuss the possibility of using different\nauctions for allocating the good. We conjecture that any standard auction yields the same qualitative results,\nbut we use the second-price auction because it is easier to analyze.\n2\nBringing more money increases the probability of consuming but it is costly because the value\nof any unspent balances depreciates over time due to inflation and discounting. Dispersion\nin money leads to dispersion in prices and we explicitly characterize the realized distribution\nof prices in the market.4 The main efficiency result is that entry is suboptimal except when\nthe money supply contracts at the rate of time preference \u2013 the Friedman rule.\nWhen agents are permanently heterogeneous in their productivity levels we show that\nmore productive buyers hold higher balances since they face lower utility costs of earning\nmoney. Higher inflation leads to lower seller entry (increased scarcity) which reduces welfare\nfor all buyers. When inflation is below a threshold, low productivity buyers are hurt more\nfrom an increase in the rate of money growth despite the fact that they hold less money. Low\nproductivity buyers are the first to be priced out of the market when scarcity increases: they\nare always outbid by their high productivity competitors who they face more often when\nscarcity is more acute. If the inflation rate is very high, the low productivity buyers hardly\ntrade at all and therefore any additional increase in money growth has little effect on them.\nErosa and Ventura (2002) and Albanesi (2007) examine, and present evidence for, the re-\ngressive effect of inflation in models without explicit micro-foundations for fiat money. Private\ninformation is a feature of Faig and Jerez (2006) and Ennis (in press) where buyers are subject\nto idiosyncratic taste shocks and sellers screen customers by offering price-quantity menus.\nBoth papers consider buyers who are ex ante homogeneous and are primarily interested in\nthe distortions caused by inflation rather than its distributional effects on permanently het-\nerogeneous agents. Satterthwaite and Shneyerov (2006) introduce multilateral matching and\nauctions to deal with private information in a non-monetary environment of decentralized\ntrade. Our uniqueness and efficiency results are closely related to the competitive search\nmarket structure of Rocheteau and Wright (2005). Our setting is related to the budget con-\nstrained auctions examined in Che and Gale (1998) because buyers will, in general, choose\nto hold less money than their actual valuation for the good.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and proves\nsome preliminary results. The following section solves for the equilibrium when all agents are\nhomogeneous and examines the efficiency properties of inflation. Section 4 introduces het-\nerogeneity in productivity and examines the distributional effects of inflation on the different\ntypes of agents. Section 5 touches on robustness issues and concludes.\n4Dispersion of money holdings is typically a feature of models where an agent\u2019s money holdings do depend\non his history of trades, e.g. Molico (2006), Green and Zhou (2002), or Camera and Corbae (1999). Price\ndispersion is also an equilibrium outcome of the monetary model of Head and Kumar (2005) where it is due\nto the informational asymmetries among buyers.\n3\n2 The Model\nTime is discrete and runs forever. Each period is divided in two subperiods, following LW:\na Walrasian market characterized by competitive trading and a search market characterized\nby trading frictions that are modeled explicitly. There is a continuum of infinitely-lived\nagents who differ across two dimensions. They have potentially different productivity in the\nWalrasian market and they belong to one of two groups in the search market, called buyers\nand sellers. In the Walrasian market all agents produce and consume but in the search\nmarket a buyer can only consume and a seller can only produce. Meetings in the search\nmarket occur between subsets of the population in a way described in detail below and they\nare characterized by two main frictions. First, all meetings are assumed to be anonymous\nwhich precludes credit. Hence all trades have to be quid pro quo. Second, there is no double\ncoincidence of wants, as is clear from the assumptions on agents\u2019 types: some agents can only\nproduce while others can only consume. Therefore, the agents cannot use barter to trade.\nThese frictions mean that a medium of exchange is essential for trade (see Kocherlakota\n(1998) and Wallace (2001)).\nThere is a single storable object, fiat money, which can be used as a medium of exchange\nin the search market. The stock of money at time t is given byMSt and it is perfectly divisible.\nThe money stock changes at gross rate \u03b3, so thatMSt+1 = \u03b3 M\nS\nt , and new money is introduced,\nor withdrawn if \u03b3 < 1, via lump sump transfers to sellers in the Walrasian market.5 We focus\non policies with \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b2 \u03b4, where \u03b2 \u03b4 is the discount factor as discussed below, since it is easy\nto check that there is no equilibrium otherwise. To examine what happens when the rate of\nmoney growth is exactly equal to the discount factor (the Friedman rule) we take the limit\nof equilibria as \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2 \u03b4.\nWe denote the productivity distribution by Y (\u00b7) and the measure of buyers and sellers\nby B and S, respectively. An agent\u2019s type is given by yk \u2208 suppY (\u00b7)\u00d7 {b, s} where y is his\nWalrasian market productivity and b and s denote a buyer and a seller, respectively. Let\nW ykt (m) be the value of an agent of type yk who enters the Walrasian market at time t\nholding m units of money. His instantaneous utility depends on consumption, x, and hours\nof work, h. We assume that preferences are quasi-linear and take the form U(x)\u2212 h, where\nU \u2032(x) > 0 and U \u2032\u2032(x) < 0 for all x and limx\u21920 U \u2032(x) = \u221e, limx\u2192\u221e U \u2032(x) = 0. An hour\nof work produces y units of the consumption good x. Let \u03b2 be the discount rate between\nthe Walrasian and search markets and denote the value of carrying m\u2032 dollars to the search\nmarket of period t by V ykt (m\n\u2032). The agent\u2019s value function in the Walrasian market at time\n5In an earlier version of the paper we considered the case where both buyers and sellers receive transfers\n(see Galenianos and Kircher (2006)). This turns out not to matter for the equilibrium characterization but\nthe analysis is somewhat simpler when buyers do not receive transfers.\n4\nt is\nW ykt (m) = max\nx,h,m\u2032\n[U(x)\u2212 h+ \u03b2 V ykt (m\u2032)] (1)\ns.t. x \u2264 y h+ \u03c6t(T\u02c6 kt +m\u2212m\u2032),\nwhere \u03c6t is the value of money in consumption terms and T\u02c6\nk\nt is the nominal monetary transfers\nto (or from) an agent, where T\u02c6 st = (\u03b3 \u2212 1) Mt\u22121\/S and T\u02c6 bt = 0.6\nIt will prove useful to first solve some of the non-monetary decisions of the agents and\nthen concentrate on the more interesting choices relating to money holdings. Substituting\nthe constraint with equality into equation (1) gives\nW ykt (m) =\n\u03c6t (T\u02c6\nk\nt +m)\ny\n+max\nx,m\u2032\n[U(x)\u2212 x+ \u03c6t m\n\u2032\ny\n+ \u03b2 V ykt (m)].\nThe quasi-linearity of preferences eliminates wealth effects simplifying the problem of the\nagent significantly: current balances, m, have no effect on the choices of consumption or\nfuture money balances.7 Our assumptions on U(\u00b7) ensure that U \u2032(x\u2217y) = 1\/y is a necessary\nand sufficient condition for the optimal choice of x. We can rewrite the problem as\nW ykt (m) =\n\u03c6t (T\u02c6\nk\nt +m)\ny\n+ U\u2217y +max\nm\u2032\n[\u2212\u03c6t m\n\u2032\ny\n+ \u03b2 V ykt (m\n\u2032)], (2)\nwhere U\u2217y = U(x\n\u2217\ny)\u2212 x\u2217y and U \u2032(x\u2217y) = 1\/y.\nThe choice of future money balances is more involved and we first describe the search\nmarket in order to see the relevant incentives.\nThe search market operates as follows. First, each seller decides whether to incur utility\ncost K > 0 in order to enter the search market. We interpret K as a production cost that\nhas to be undertaken prior to matching with buyers and endows the seller with a single\nindivisible unit of the good. The good is perishable, can be transferred at zero cost and the\nutility to the seller of consuming his own good is zero while the utility that a buyer receives\nis given by u > K. Indivisibility aside, the other assumptions about the good are tailored\nso that the seller\u2019s reservation price is zero. Having a strictly positive reservation price does\nnot significantly change our results but it complicates the analysis.\nThe sellers who enter the search market set up their shop at some physical location.\n6We only examine equilibria with h > 0 and hence we ignore the non-negativity constraints on h. One\ncan impose conditions on the primitives to guarantee that this holds, as shown in LW.\n7For the same reason, our assumption on how transfers are distributed is innocuous: it does not affect\nany of the monetary choices that we are interested in, although it does affect the agents\u2019 level of utility.\n5\nThere is a continuum of locations each accommodating at most one seller. We denote the\nbuyer-seller ratio at time t by \u03bbt. We assume that the measure of potential sellers, S, is large\nenough so that \u03bbt is determined by an indifference condition for entry. We normalize the\nmeasure of buyers to 1 so that 1\/\u03bbt gives the measure of sellers who enter the search market.\nThis normalization is without loss of generality, as the next paragraph makes clear.\nWe begin by analyzing the buyer\u2019s problem for a fixed \u03bbt and we then allow for the\nfree entry of sellers. When entering the search market, a buyer visits at random one of\nthe locations that are populated with sellers. This assumption can be formulated as an\nequilibrium of a broader game where buyers strategically choose which seller to visit: if\nevery other buyer picks a seller at random, it is a best response to randomize as well.8 Our\nmatching process implies that the number of buyers that visit a particular seller is a random\nvariable, and hence demand is stochastic while supply is fixed at one unit. Therefore, the\ngood may get rationed and some of the buyers may end up not consuming. Before proceeding\nto describe the allocation process, note that we have urn-ball matching and so the number\nof buyers follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bbt.\n9 This matching function exhibits\nconstant returns to scale and therefore the buyer-seller ratio is the only relevant statistic for\nthe matching probabilities.\nThe way the good is allocated is the main innovation of this paper: we assume that a\nsecond-price auction takes place. The seller accepts any non-negative bids since his reser-\nvation price is zero. All buyers have the same valuation for the good, but they may hold\ndifferent amounts of money. In a second-price auction a buyer\u2019s dominant strategy is to bid\nhis money holdings, except when the money\u2019s value exceed his valuation of the good which\nwe will show can never occur since the sole purpose of holding fiat money is to buy the search\nmarket good. We focus on equilibria where buyers follow dominant strategies. The outcome\nof the auction is that the buyer with most money (or one of the buyers with the highest\nmoney holdings in the case of a tie) buys the good and the price that he pays is equal to\nthe second highest money holdings in the match. If a single buyer appears at some location\nthen he gets the good at a price of zero. This mechanism balances demand and supply at\nthe lowest price that clears the market, i.e. the lowest price such that exactly one unit of\nthe good is demanded. The underlying idea is that a buyer makes price bids that can be\nmatched by the other buyers who have visited the same location, as in an ascending bid (or\nsecond-price) auction. A difference with respect to bilateral matching is the seller receives a\n8We want to abstract from the repeated game effects that may arise if a buyer meets with the same seller\nat each period\u2019s search market. One way to do this is to assume sellers populate a random location every time\nthey enter; alternatively, we can assume that it is not the same sellers who enter the market every period.\n9Suppose k buyers are allocated randomly across l sellers. The number of buyers that visit a given seller\nfollows a binomial distribution with probability 1\/l and sample size k. As k, l \u2192 \u221e keeping k\/l = \u03bb the\ndistribution converges to a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb.\n6\npositive share of the surplus due to the presence of many buyers at the same location even\nthough the winning buyer makes what amounts to a take-it-or-leave-it offer.\nThe incentives to hold money are now clear: holding more money increases the proba-\nbility of consuming since it allows a buyer to outbid more of his potential competitors; on\nthe other hand it is costly because the value of any unspent money balances depreciates over\ntime due to discounting and inflation. It is also worth noting that the reason why an agent\nmay not spend his fiat money is very different than in most of the monetary search literature.\nIn this paper, the amount of money that a buyer ends up spending depends on how many\nother buyers visit the same location and on how much money they hold. Hence, despite the\nfact that a buyer is matched with some seller with probability one, he does not in general\nspend all of his money. In most of the literature the cost of liquidity arises from the buyer\u2019s\nfailure to meet someone whose good he wants to buy.\nWe now characterize the buyers\u2019 value function. Whether a buyer transacts, and at what\nprice, depends on how many other buyers have visited the same location and on how much\nmoney they hold. Hence we need to introduce some additional notation to describe the money\nholdings of all buyers: aggregating the choices of m\u2032 across buyers gives the distribution of\nmoney holdings at the end of Walrasian trading (or, equivalently, at the beginning of the\nsearch market) which we denote by F\u02c6t(\u00b7).\nLet V ybt (m,n) denote the expected payoff of a productivity-y buyer who holds m dollars\nand meets n other buyers at the location that he visits. The probability that he meets exactly\nn competitors is P tn = \u03bb\nn\nt e\n\u2212\u03bbt\/n! due to Poisson matching. The value of entering the search\nmarket with m dollars is thus given by\nV ybt (m) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nP tn V\nyb\nt (m,n). (3)\nTo calculate V ybt (m,n), let m(n) be the highest money holdings among the n competitors that\nthe current buyer faces. If m < m(n) the buyer with m dollars does not transact and he keeps\nall his money for the next Walrasian market. If m > m(n) the buyer with m dollars buys\nthe good and pays m(n) to the seller. If m = m(n) there is a tie and the good is allocated\nat random to one of the buyers with m(n) dollars who then transfers his full money holdings\nto the seller. Therefore, m(n) is the only statistic we need in order to calculate the expected\npayoff of a buyer who faces n competitors.\nThe money holdings of each competitor is a random draw from F\u02c6t(\u00b7) since buyers are\nallocated at random across sellers. The highest money holdings among the n other buyers\nis the highest order statistic among n iid draws from F\u02c6t(\u00b7) which is distributed according\n7\nto F\u02c6t(\u00b7)n.10 Observe that the probability that two randomly chosen buyers hold exactly the\nsame amount of money is zero unless F\u02c6t(\u00b7) has a mass point at that level. To denote this\npossibility we define \u00b5t(m) \u2261 F\u02c6t(m)\u2212 F\u02c6t(m\u2212), where F\u02c6t(m\u2212) = limm\u02dc\u2197m F\u02c6t(m\u02dc). This implies\nthat \u00b5t(m) > 0 if and only if there is a mass point at m. Conditional on all n competitors\nholding weakly less than m dollars, the number of buyers (out of n) who have exactly m\ndollars follows a binomial distribution with sample size n and probability \u00b5t(m)\/F\u02c6t(m).\n11\nLet qnlt (m) denote the probability that l out of the other n buyers hold exactly m dollars\nconditional on none of them having more than m dollars. If there is no mass point at m,\nthen qn0t (m) = 1 and q\nnl\nt (m) = 0 for l \u2265 1.\nThe value of meeting n competitors at time t when holding m dollars is given by\nV ybt (m,n) = [1\u2212 F\u02c6t(m)n] \u03b4 W ybt+1(m) +\u222b m\u2212\n0\n[u+ \u03b4 W ybt+1(m\u2212 m\u02dc)] dF\u02c6t(m\u02dc)n +\nF\u02c6t(m)\nn\nn\u2211\nl=1\nqnlt (m) [\nu+ \u03b4 W ybt+1(0)\nl + 1\n+\nl \u03b4 W ybt+1(m)\nl + 1\n], (4)\nwhere \u03b4 is the discount factor between the search and Walrasian markets. The term in the\nfirst square brackets gives the probability that at least one competitor holds strictly more\nmoney thanm dollars, which means that the current buyer does not purchase the good and he\nkeeps his money for next period\u2019s Walrasian market. The second term denotes the expected\npayoff when all other buyers hold strictly less money and hence the buyer with m dollars gets\nthe good and pays the second highest amount. The integral gives the instantaneous utility\nfrom consuming the good, u, plus the continuation value after accounting for the payment.\nFinally, if none of the competitors bring more than m dollars but l \u2265 1 of them hold exactly\nm dollars, then with probability 1\/(l + 1) the current buyer gets the good, consumes, and\ncontinues to the next Walrasian market without any money; with probability l\/(l + 1) he\ndoes not purchase the good and he keeps all his money for the next period. It should be clear\nfrom this discussion that the probability of a purchase is discontinuous at m if F\u02c6t(\u00b7) has a\nmass point at that level. Moreover, as mentioned above, the last term of equation (4) drops\nout if there is no mass point at m. We have completed the description of the buyer\u2019s problem.\nWe now turn to the sellers. Sellers can derive no benefit from holding money and therefore\n10This is a standard result from statistics. For instance, see Hogg and Craig (1994).\n11Conditional on all buyers holding weakly less than m dollars, the money holdings of an agent is a random\ndraw from F\u02c6t(\u00b7) truncated at, and including, m. Hence, the probability that the result of any draw is exactly\nequal to m is given by \u00b5t(m)\/F\u02c6t(m). The binomial distribution follows since there are n draws.\n8\nthey carry no money to the search market. We assume that y = 1 for all sellers since their\nproductivity does not affect their decisions in any interesting way. A seller can choose whether\nto enter the search market or not. If he enters, he gives up K units of utility and may earn\nsome revenues to spend in the following Walrasian market. Let \u03a0\u02c6t be the seller\u2019s expected\nrevenues if he enters the search market at time t. \u03a0\u02c6t is a sufficient statistic for the value\nof entry because W 1st (\u00b7) is linear in money. If the seller does not enter, he continues to\nthe following Walrasian market without money. As a result, the seller\u2019s value of the search\nmarket is given by\nV 1st = max{\u2212K + \u03b4 W 1st+1(\u03a0\u02c6t), \u03b4 W 1st+1(0)}.\nIn equilibrium sellers are indifferent between the two options which means that, using equa-\ntion (2), the following condition has to hold for all t:\n\u03b4 \u03c6t+1 \u03a0\u02c6t = K. (5)\nTo determine \u03a0\u02c6t, note that the price a seller receives is equal to the second highest\nmoney holdings among the buyers that show up in his location. When n buyers visit a par-\nticular seller, the second highest order statistic is distributed according to F\u02c6\n(n\u22121, n)\nt (m) =\nn F\u02c6t(m)\nn\u22121 [1\u2212F\u02c6t(m)]+F\u02c6t(m)n (Hogg and Craig (1994)). The probability that n buyers show\nup is given by P tn and we define the distribution of prices by G\u02c6t(m) \u2261\n\u2211\u221e\nn=1 P\nt\nn F\u02c6\n(n\u22121, n)\nt (m).\nG\u02c6t(m) denotes the probability that a seller receives no more than m dollars in the search\nmarket at time t, after summing over all the possible number of buyers. The expected rev-\nenues of a seller at t are given by \u03a0\u02c6t =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nm\u02dc dG\u02c6t(m\u02dc).\nLast, we need to define market clearing in the money market. Since sellers have zero\nbalances, the demand for money at time t is given by the amount that buyers hold, i.e.\nMDt =\n\u222b\u221e\n0\nm\u02dc dF\u02c6t(m\u02dc). At time t, the money market clears if\nMDt = M\nS\nt . (6)\nTurning to the equilibrium definition, note that there is always an equilibrium where fiat\nmoney is not valued, as is common in monetary models. Throughout this paper we focus\non monetary equilibria with the property \u03c6t > 0 \u2200 t, and statements about non-existence\nof an equilibrium refer to monetary equilibria. Furthermore, we only examine stationary\nequilibria in the sense that real variables remain constant over time. In particular, we restrict\nattention to equilibria where \u03bbt = \u03bbt+1 and the real demand for money does not change, i.e.\n9\n\u03c6t M\nD\nt = \u03c6t+1 M\nD\nt+1. Since the money supply grows at a constant rate \u03b3 and M\nD\nt = M\nS\nt\nthe latter condition implies that \u03c6t = \u03b3 \u03c6t+1. We define a stationary monetary equilibrium\n(henceforth an equilibrium) as follows.\nDefinition 2.1 An equilibrium is a list {W ykt , V ykt , F\u02c6t, \u03c6t, \u03bbt} where W ykt and V ykt are the\nvalue functions, F\u02c6t is the distribution of money holdings at the beginning of the search market\nat t, \u03c6t is the price of money at t, and \u03bbt is the buyer-seller ratio at t such that the following\nconditions are satisfied for all t.\n1. Optimality: given \u03c6t, any m\n\u2032 \u2208 suppF\u02c6t solves (2).\n2. Market Clearing: equation (6) holds.\n3. Free entry: equation (5) holds.\n4. Monetary Equilibrium and Stationarity: \u03c6t = \u03b3 \u03c6t+1 > 0 and \u03bbt = \u03bbt+1.\nWe now summarize the important decisions that agents make in our environment: buyers\nchoose how much money to hold and sellers choose whether to enter the search market. More\nspecifically, a buyer chooses his money holdings taking as given \u03bbt, \u03c6t and the decisions of\nother buyers. Aggregating across buyers yields F\u02c6t(\u00b7) as a function of \u03bbt and \u03c6t. In equilibrium,\nthe price of money is such that money demand equals MSt , which pins down \u03c6t as a function\nof the buyer-seller ratio and the supply of money. Free entry of sellers gives \u03bbt as a function\nof the cost of entry.\nIn the next section we solve the model for homogeneous buyers and we re-introduce\nheterogeneity in section 4.\n3 The Case of Homogeneous Buyers\nWe now consider the special case where y = 1 for all buyers. We omit the productivity\nsuperscript for the rest of this section.\n3.1 The Buyers\u2019 Problem\nAt the beginning of every period the problem of a buyer is to choose the optimal money\nholdings, taking as given the choices of all other agents and the price of money. It is immediate\nthat the utility of consumption puts an upper bound on the range of the optimal fiat money\ndecision. Let m\u2217t be such that a buyer is indifferent between spending m\n\u2217\nt to consume or\nkeeping the full amount for the next Walrasian market. This amount exists since u <\u221e and\n10\nit is defined by the following equation: u+\u03b4 W bt+1(m\u2212m\u2217t ) = \u03b4 W bt+1(m)\u21d2 m\u2217t = u\/(\u03b4 \u03c6t+1),\nwhere m is a large enough number. In equilibrium a buyer never spends more than m\u2217t , hence\nhe never brings more than that amount to the search market. Letting mt and mt denote\nthe infimum and supremum, respectively, of the support of F\u02c6t(\u00b7) the discussion above implies\nthat 0 \u2264 mt \u2264 mt \u2264 m\u2217t .\nWe can reformulate the buyer\u2019s problem on a period-by-period basis as\nmax\nm\u2208[0,m\u2217t ]\n\u2212\u03c6t m+ \u03b2 V bt (m), (7)\ntaking F\u02c6t(\u00b7), \u03c6t, and \u03bbt as given (stationarity implies that knowing the price of money for\nsome t pins down the whole path of prices). The first proposition derives a set of properties\nthat the distribution F\u02c6t(\u00b7) satisfies in equilibrium.\nProposition 3.1 In equilibrium F\u02c6t(\u00b7) is non-atomic on [0,m\u2217t ), the support of F\u02c6t(\u00b7) is con-\nnected, and the infimum of the support is 0.\nProof. Suppose that F\u02c6t(\u00b7) has a mass point at some m\u02c7 \u2208 [0,m\u2217t ). Buying the good for m\u02c7\ndollars gives positive net utility since m\u02c7 < m\u2217t . Equation (4) implies that the probability\nof buying is discontinuous at m\u02c7, hence V bt (m\u02c7) < V\nb\nt (m\u02c7\n+). Bringing m\u02c7 + \u000f yields strictly\nhigher payoff than m\u02c7 since the cost of bringing infinitesimally more money is negligible and\ntherefore in equilibrium a buyer never brings m\u02c7 yielding a contradiction.\nSuppose that there is no buyer whose money holdings belong to some interval (m1,m2),\nwith mt \u2264 m1 < m2 \u2264 mt. The m1-buyer trades in exactly the same events as the buyer\nwith m2 dollars since they both outbid exactly the same set of competitors (except when\nthere is a mass point at m2 which cannot occur unless m2 = m\n\u2217\nt , as shown above; if m2 = m\n\u2217\nt\nthe additional transactions that the m2-buyer can perform do not yield any utility gains\nsince he is indifferent between keeping his money or consuming). It is easy to verify that\nV bt (m2) = V\nb\nt (m1)+ \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 (m2\u2212m1). Examining the initial decision of how much money to\nhold, we have that \u2212\u03c6t m1 + \u03b2 V bt (m1)\u2212 [\u2212\u03c6t m2 + \u03b2 V bt (m2)] = (m2 \u2212m1) [\u03c6t \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4 \u03c6t+1]\nwhich is strictly positive since \u03c6t = \u03b3 \u03c6t+1 and \u03b3 > \u03b2 \u03b4. This means that carrying m1 dollars\ngives strictly higher value than holding m2 which cannot happen in equilibrium.\nLast, a buyer bringing mt dollars can only transact when he does not meet any competi-\ntors, in which case the price he pays is equal to 0. Therefore Vt(mt) = Vt(0) + \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 mt,\nwhich implies that mt > 0 cannot occur in equilibrium for the same reason as above.\nThe intuition why F\u02c6t(\u00b7) is non-atomic in its interior is straightforward (the next propo-\nsition proves that there is no mass point at the upper boundary either): If there is a mass\n11\npoint in the distribution of money holdings, then it is very likely to meet some buyer holding\nexactly that amount of money. In that case, a buyer who brings infinitesimally more money\nfaces a discretely higher probability of winning the auction for negligible additional cost.\nTherefore, this buyer enjoys a higher expected payoff which cannot happen in equilibrium.12\nOne important implication of this result is that the optimal decision of buyers is correspondence-\nvalued.13 In equilibrium there is a range of values of m that yield the same expected payoff\nand therefore buyers are willing to randomize over them. Equation (7) implies that Vt(m) is\nlinear in the domain of solutions and hence it is not strictly concave.\nFrom now on we only consider F\u02c6t(\u00b7) that are continuous on [0,m\u2217t ) with F\u02c6t(0) = 0 and\nsuppF\u02c6t = [0,mt]. We can rewrite equations (3) and (4) as follows:\nV bt (m) = \u03b4 W\nb\nt+1(m) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nP tn [u F\u02c6t(m)\nn \u2212 \u03b4 \u03c6t+1\n\u222b m\n0\nm\u02dc dF\u02c6t(m\u02dc)\nn]. (8)\nThis expression is very intuitive: the first term is the value that the buyer can guarantee\nhimself without a purchase; inside the square brackets, the first term is the probability of\nbuying the good times the instantaneous utility of consumption while the second term is the\npayment from a purchase. Note that we do not account for the event where the buyer has\nm = m\u2217t dollars and he meets another buyer holding exactly the same amount, which could\noccur since we have not yet ruled out the possibility of a mass point at m\u2217t . However, in that\nevent the price is m\u2217t which means that the buyer is indifferent between buying the good or\ncontinuing with all his money. Therefore, the value of holdingm\u2217t is still given by equation (8).\nWe now turn to the explicit characterization of the solution to the buyer\u2019s problem. In\nequilibrium, \u2212\u03c6t m + \u03b2 V bt (m) is constant on [0,mt]. We construct F\u02c6t(\u00b7) such that this\ncondition holds.\nProposition 3.2 In equilibrium the distribution of money holdings is uniquely defined by\nF\u02c6t(m) =\n1\n\u03bbt\nlog[1\u2212 e\u03bbt (\u03b3\/(\u03b2 \u03b4)\u2212 1) log(1\u2212 \u03b4 \u03c6t m\n\u03b3 u\n)]. (9)\nFurthermore, mt < m\n\u2217\nt .\n12The logic of this proof is similar to the no mass point proof of Burdett and Judd (1983) and Burdett and\nMortensen (1998) though the context is very different.\n13In contrast, in LW there is always a symmetric equilibrium where all agents bring the same amount of\nmoney. Equilibria with asymmetric money holdings are possible but they can be ruled out under relatively\nmild assumptions.\n12\nProof. Equation (7) implies that V b\u2032t (m) = \u03c6t\/\u03b2 for m \u2208 [0,mt]. For V bt (\u00b7) to be differ-\nentiable, any equilibrium F\u02c6t(\u00b7) has to be differentiable on (0,mt). We start by assuming\ndifferentiability and we then verify that our solution satisfies this property.\nTaking the derivative of (8) with respect to m we get (using Leibniz\u2019s rule and noting\nthat m does not enter the integrand)\nV b\u2032t (m) = \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nP tn [u n F\u02c6t(m)\nn\u22121 F\u02c6 \u2032t(m)\u2212 \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 m n F\u02c6t(m)n\u22121 F\u02c6 \u2032t(m)]\n= \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 + (u\u2212 \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 m) F\u02c6 \u2032t(m) \u03bbt e\u2212\u03bbt (1\u2212F\u02c6t(m)), (10)\nwhich follows from the fact that n \u223c Po(\u03bbt).\nEquating (10) with \u03c6t\/\u03b2 and rearranging yields the following differential equation:\n\u03bbt F\u02c6\n\u2032\nt(m) e\n\u03bbt F\u02c6t(m) = e\u03bbt\n\u03b4 \u03c6t+1 it\nu\u2212 \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 m,\nwhere it \u2261 \u03c6t\/(\u03c6t+1 \u03b2 \u03b4)\u2212 1 is the nominal interest rate at t. Integrating both sides over m,\nusing the initial condition F\u02c6t(0) = 0, and recalling that \u03c6t = \u03c6t+1 \u03b3 yields (9).\nThe maximum money balances, mt, can be calculated by using F\u02c6t(mt) = 1:\nmt =\nu\n\u03b4 \u03c6t+1\n(1\u2212 e\u2212 1\u2212e\n\u2212\u03bbt\nit ). (11)\nSince m\u2217t = u\/(\u03b4 \u03c6t+1) it is clear that all buyers bring less money than m\n\u2217\nt and hence there\nis no mass point in the distribution of money holdings.\nThe next step is to close the buyers\u2019 side of the model by finding the equilibrium price of\nmoney, \u03c6t, which equates the demand of money with exogenous supply M\nS\nt .\nProposition 3.3 There is a unique equilibrium price \u03c6\u2217t such that M\nD\nt = M\nS\nt .\nProof. We first show that money demand at time t, MDt , is decreasing in \u03c6t. We can use\nequation (9) to define money demand at t as a function of \u03c6t, M\nD\nt (\u03c6t). It is easy to check\nthat \u2202F\u02c6t(m)\/\u2202\u03c6t > 0. As a result the money distribution that results from a low \u03c6t first order\nstochastically dominates the one that results from high \u03c6t which proves that \u2202M\nD\nt \/\u2202\u03c6t < 0.\nTo complete the proof we need to show that MDt (\u221e) < MSt < MDt (0) for some arbitrary\nMSt . Note that lim\u03c6t\u2192\u221emt = 0 \u21d2 lim\u03c6t\u2192\u221eMDt (\u03c6t) = 0. Also, lim\u03c6t\u21920 mt = \u221e and\nlim\u03c6t\u21920 F\u02c6t(m) = 0, \u2200m < mt imply that lim\u03c6t\u21920 MDt (\u03c6t) =\u221e.\nCorollary 3.1 The price of money is determinate. The buyer-seller ratio, \u03bbt, uniquely de-\ntermines the distribution of money holdings of buyers.\n13\nTo simplify notation, we redefine all variables in real terms. We express a dollar in terms\nof its consumption value in the search market. Equation (8) implies that m dollars are worth\nzt = \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 m units of utility at time t, i.e. we convert the m dollars to utility terms at\nthe price of the following Walrasian market (when they can next be used) and then discount\nthat utility to the present search market terms. Together with the stationarity condition\n\u03c6t = \u03b3 \u03c6t+1, this means that the real value of any unspent balances depreciates at rate \u03b3: in\nperiod t + 1 the m dollars are worth zt+1 = \u03b4 \u03c6t+2 m = zt\/\u03b3. We denote real transfers by\nT kt = \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 T\u02c6\nk\nt and expected real revenues by \u03a0t = \u03b4 \u03c6t+1 \u03a0\u02c6t. Last, we dispense with the\ntime subscript since we are in a stationary environment.\nMaking the relevant substitutions into our value functions we obtain\nW b(z) = z \u03b3\/\u03b4 + U\u2217 +max\nz\u2032\n{\u2212z\u2032 \u03b3\/\u03b4 + \u03b2 V b(z\u2032)} (12)\nV b(z) = \u03b4 W b(z\/\u03b3) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn [u F (z)\nn \u2212\n\u222b z\n0\nz\u02dc dF (z\u02dc)n] (13)\nW s(z) = (z + T s) \u03b3\/\u03b4 + U\u2217 + \u03b2 V s (14)\nV s = max{\u03b4 W s(\u03a0\/\u03b3)\u2212K, \u03b4 W s(0)}. (15)\nWe can also rewrite the distribution of real balances as\nF (z) =\n1\n\u03bb\nln[1\u2212 e\u03bb i ln(1\u2212 z\nu\n)], (16)\nwhere i = \u03b3\/(\u03b4 \u03b2) \u2212 1 and define the distribution of real revenues G(\u00b7) accordingly. The\nhighest real money holdings are given by z = u (1\u2212 e\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb)\/i).\n10.750.50.250\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nz\nf(z)\ni =.05\ni =.3\ni =.6\ni =1\nf )\nz\nFigure 1: Density of real money balances for different levels of the interest rate i and u = 1,\n\u03bb = 1.\n14\nFigure 1 shows the density of real money holdings for different levels of the interest rate\nand \u03bb = 1. At very high interest rates the density is decreasing. In the intermediate range\nit is U-shaped. For low interest rate it is increasing.\nNote that the distribution of real balances collapses to a mass point at u as the rate of\nmoney growth approaches the Friedman rule (\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b2 \u03b4 or, equivalently, i \u2192 0): F (z) \u2192 0\nfor any z < z and z \u2192 u as i \u2192 0. This means that at the Friedman rule the real balances\nof every buyer is equal to his valuation for the good. Furthermore, it is easy to show that\nthe mean of the money distribution increases and its variance decreases as the inflation rate\nfalls.\n3.2 The Sellers\u2019 Problem\nSection 3.1 established that the buyers\u2019 distribution of real money holdings (and hence ex-\npected real revenues) is uniquely determined by the buyer-seller ratio. Therefore, from now\non we write \u03a0(\u03bb). In equilibrium, free entry requires that \u03a0(\u03bb) = K. We show that an\nequilibrium exists if and only if the inflation rate is below a certain threshold. Furthermore,\nwe prove that if an equilibrium exists then there is a unique \u03bb\u2217 satisfying the free entry\ncondition. The uniqueness of equilibrium is interesting because typically there are multiple\nstationary equilibria in models with bilateral matching and bargaining. We elaborate on the\nreasons that lead to this difference at the end of the section.\nWe begin by characterizing the distribution of real prices.\nProposition 3.4 The distribution of prices is given by\nG(z) = (1 + \u03bb\u2212 \u03bb F (z)) e\u2212\u03bb (1\u2212F (z)), (17)\nwhere F (z) is defined in (16).\nProof. Recall that G(z) =\n\u2211\u221e\nn=0 Pn F\n(n\u22121,n)(z) and F (n\u22121)(z) = n F (z)n\u22121 [1 \u2212 F (z)] +\nF (z)n. Equation (17) follows.\nProposition 3.5 If an equilibrium exists, then it is unique.\nProof. For uniqueness, it is sufficient to show that \u2202\u03a0(\u03bb)\/\u2202\u03bb > 0. To prove that the\nexpected profits (prices) are strictly increasing in the number of buyers per seller we show that\n\u2202G(z)\/\u2202\u03bb < 0 which means that the distribution of prices for high \u03bb first order stochastically\n15\ndominates the one for a low \u03bb. Using equation (16), one can show that\n\u2202F (z)\n\u2202\u03bb\n= \u2212F (z)\n\u03bb\n+\n\u2212e\u2212\u03bb i ln(1\u2212 z\/u)\n\u03bb [1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb i ln(1\u2212 z\/u)]\n=\n1\n\u03bb\n[1\u2212 F (z)\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb F (z)]. (18)\nThe last step is to note that\n\u2202G(z)\n\u2202\u03bb\n= \u2212\u03bb (1\u2212 F (z)) [1\u2212 F (z)\u2212 \u03bb \u2202F (z)\n\u2202\u03bb\n] e\u2212\u03bb (1\u2212F (z))\n= \u2212\u03bb (1\u2212 F (z)) e\u2212\u03bb < 0, (19)\nwhere the second equality results from inserting equation (18). This completes the proof.\nProposition 3.6 Given K, an equilibrium exists if and only if \u03b3 < \u03b3\u00af(K), where \u03b3\u00af(K) is\ndefined by K = u (1\u2212 e\u22121\/\u00afi) and i\u00af = \u03b3\u00af(K)\/(\u03b2 \u03b4)\u2212 1.\nProof. It easy to check that lim\u03bb\u21920\u03a0(\u03bb) = 0. Therefore, if lim\u03bb\u2192\u221e\u03a0(\u03bb) > K the (unique)\nequilibrium exists. As \u03bb\u2192\u221e a seller is visited by some buyer with probability 1. Further-\nmore, the seller\u2019s revenues converge to the highest money holdings, z. Therefore,\nlim\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e\n\u03a0(\u03bb) = lim\n\u03bb\u2192\u221e\nz = u (1\u2212 e\u22121\/i).\nNoting that the maximum profits are decreasing in the inflation rate (\u2202\u03a0(\u221e)\/\u2202\u03b3 < 0) and\nthat \u03a0(\u221e) = K if and only if \u03b3 = \u03b3\u00af(K) completes the proof.\nDecreasing the inflation rate acts as a mean-preserving spread for the distribution of real\nprices due to adjustment at the extensive margin. The mean of the distribution (expected\nrevenues) is constant regardless of inflation because of the response of seller entry. The\nprice is zero when a seller has zero or one buyer and this event occurs more frequently when\ninflation decreases due to higher entry. When two or more buyers show up, the distribution\nof prices converges to a mass point at u as the rate of money growth approaches the Friedman\nrule. Thus, the variance of real prices increases as inflation approaches the Friedman rule.\nThe uniqueness of equilibrium is worth commenting on, especially since Rocheteau and\nWright (2005) find that in a model with bilateral matching there are generically multiple\nequilibria. In both models, increased competition for the search market goods among buyers\n(higher \u03bb) may reduce the buyers\u2019 incentives to bring money since their balances are less\nlikely to be used: in the bilateral matching framework every buyer brings less money in\nresponse to an increase of the buyer-seller ratio; in our model, the same thing happens for\n16\n10.750.50.250\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nz\nf(z)f(z)\nz\n\u03bb = .2\n\u03bb = 5\n\u03bb = 1\n10.750.50.250\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nz\nf(z)\n.\n.\n.\nf( )\n10.750.50.250\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\nz\nf(z)\n...\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n.\nf(z)g(z)\nz\n\u03bb = 5\n\u03bb = 1\n\u03bb = .2\nFigure 2: Density of real balances and prices for different levels \u03bb and u = 1, i = 0.05.\nat least some of the buyers, as can be seen in the left graph of figure 2 where buyers at the\nbottom end of the money distribution choose to hold less money as \u03bb increases from 1 to\n5. Nevertheless, in our model an increase in \u03bb leads to higher expected revenues for sellers\nsince more buyers visit each seller on average.14 In a bilateral matching framework, however,\na seller is only matched with a single buyer at a time and an increase in \u03bb leads to greater\nprobability of trade but for lower revenues. Whether expected profits (probability of trade\ntimes revenues) increase or not depends on parameter values, leading to generic multiplicity\nof equilibria. It is therefore the multilateral nature of matching that leads to the uniqueness\nresult. Indeed, when Rocheteau and Wright (2005) consider a search market structure based\non competitive search they find uniqueness of equilibrium.\n3.3 Efficiency and Inflation\nIn this section we examine the effects of inflation on efficiency. Since every meeting between\na seller and some buyers results in the efficient outcome (a trade), the question of interest\nis whether the efficient number of sellers enter into the market. We show that efficiency\nis attained only when the inflation rate is at the Friedman rule, i.e. the stock of money\ndecreases at the rate of time preference. Again, this feature is shared with the competitive\nsearch market structure of Rocheteau and Wright (2005).\nProposition 3.7 The level of entry is efficient at the Friedman rule. When \u03b3 > \u03b2 \u03b4 entry\nis suboptimal.\n14More specifically, a high value of \u03bb leads to a price distribution that first order stochastically dominates\nthe one that results from a low \u03bb, as can be seen in figure 2. The figure omits the mass point at a zero price\nwhich results when zero or one buyers show up.\n17\nProof. We start by solving for the level of entry that maximizes surplus in the search market.\nA planner chooses \u03bb to maximize the following objective function:\nW = (1\u2212 e\n\u2212\u03bb) u\n\u03bb\n\u2212 K\n\u03bb\n. (20)\nThe first term gives the surplus that is generated from a trade, u, times the number of trades\n(number of sellers, 1\/\u03bb, times the probability a seller trades, 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bb). The second term gives\nthe entry cost of 1\/\u03bb sellers. Setting the first order conditions with respect to \u03bb to zero yields\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bbP \u2212 \u03bbP e\u2212\u03bbP ) u = K. (21)\nIt is easy to check that the second derivative is negative, hence equation (21) is both necessary\nand sufficient for optimality.\nWe now compare \u03bbP with the equilibrium buyer-seller ratio. First note that an inefficiency\narises whenever the inflation rate is high enough to prevent any entry to the search market\nbecause (21) means the market should operate (i.e. \u03bbP < \u221e) whenever u > K. When\nentry is positive, the number of sellers is still suboptimal, except at the Friedman rule.\nThe equilibrium buyer-seller ratio is determined by the free entry condition \u03a0(\u03bb) = K and\ntherefore efficiency obtains only if expected profits are given by \u03a0(\u03bb) = (1\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb e\u2212\u03bb) u.\nAt the Friedman rule the real balances of all buyers are equal to their valuation of the good,\nu, and the seller appropriates the full surplus of a match if two or more buyers show up and\nhe receives zero in the complementary case. The probability of the former event is given\nby 1 \u2212 P0 \u2212 P1 = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb e\u2212\u03bb and hence the expected revenues of the seller are equal\nto the left hand side of (21) leading to efficient entry of sellers. When the inflation rate is\nhigher than the Friedman rule, the sellers appropriate a strictly lower share of the surplus\nand therefore entry is suboptimal.\n4 The Distributional Effects of Inflation\nIn this section we re-introduce buyer heterogeneity to examine how the inflation burden is\nallocated across agents of different productivity. We consider the case of two types of buyers:\nproportion \u03b1H of buyers produce yH units of output per hour of work in the Walrasian market\nand the complementary proportion, \u03b1L, produce yL where yH > yL.\n15 We do not go over the\nsellers\u2019 part of the model because it is identical to the previous section.\nWe measure the cost of inflation in leisure-equivalent units.16 Since leisure enters linearly,\n15It is not hard to generalize our characterization to a continuous Y (\u00b7). See Galenianos and Kircher (2006).\n16A couple of caveats are in order. Our distributional results are clearly affected by who is the beneficiary\n18\nto determine which type loses more from an increase in inflation we compare the change in\nthe value function of each type as \u03b3 varies. Our main result is that low productivity buyers\nare hurt more from an increase in the rate of money growth if the inflation rate is below a\ncertain threshold. Any further increase of the inflation rate above that threshold hurts the\nhigh productivity buyers more. We show that a buyer\u2019s per-period utility only depends on\nthe buyer-seller ratio because buyers adjust their real money holdings in response to inflation.\nHigher inflation leads to lower seller entry which reduces the utility of all buyers. Buyers\nof higher productivity are better insulated against inflation-induced scarcity since they face\nlower costs in utility terms of holding fiat money. Holding more money allows them to better\ndeal with increased competition for the search market goods which leads to lower utility\nlosses from inflation. If there are very few sellers in the market (e.g. because the inflation\nrate is already very high) the low productivity buyers consume very infrequently and hence\nany further increase in the rate of money growth hurts primarily the high productivity buyers.\nFrom now on a buyer is distinguished by a superscript j \u2208 {L,H} denoting his produc-\ntivity. The value functions of a buyer are given by (corresponding to (12) and (13)):\nW j(z) = z \u03b3\/(\u03b4 yj) + U\n\u2217\nj +max\nz\u2032\n[\u2212z\u2032 \u03b3\/(\u03b4 yj) + \u03b2 V j(z\u2032)], (22)\nV j(z) = \u03b4 W j(z\/\u03b3) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn [u F (z)\nn \u2212\n\u222b z\n0\nz\u02dc\/yj dF (z\u02dc)\nn]. (23)\nwhere \u03b4 W j(z\/\u03b3) = z\/yj+\u03b4 W\nj(0), U\u2217j = U(x\n\u2217\nj)\u2212x\u2217j , and x\u2217j is the solution to U \u2032(x\u2217j) = 1\/yj.\nNotice that W j(z) is still linear in z but the slope now depends on yj.\nWe take advantage of the stationarity of our environment to express the value of an agent\nin terms of his period-by-period decentralized market value. This allows us to do explicit\ncomparative static exercises with respect to the inflation rate. Letting P (z) be the probability\nthat a buyer holding z dollars purchases the search market good and Q(z) be the expected\nprice that he pays, we have V j(z) = u P (z) + \u03b4 W j[(z \u2212Q(z))\/\u03b3] for j \u2208 {L,H}. Entering\nthis expression into equation (22) gives\nW j(z) = z \u03b3\/(\u03b4 yj) + U\n\u2217\nj \u2212 z\u2032 \u03b3\/\u03b4 + \u03b2 {u P (z\u2032) + \u03b4 W j[(z\u2032 \u2212Q(z\u2032))\/\u03b3]}, (24)\nwhere z\u2032 is an optimal solution to the money holding problem. Recalling that \u03b4 W j(z\/\u03b3) =\nof the seignorage revenues of inflation. Assuming that only sellers receive transfers avoids the question of\nhow that revenue is distributed across the different types of buyers. An alternative to our welfare measure\nis to analyze consumption-equivalent units, though that would be more complicated. Our purpose in this\npaper is to suggest one way in which this comparison can be done.\n19\nz\/yj + \u03b4 W\nj(0) and i = \u03b3\/(\u03b2 \u03b4)\u2212 1, it is straightforward to re-arrange (24) as\n(1\u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4) W j(0) = U\u2217j + \u03b2 Xj, (25)\nwhere Xj \u2261 u P (z)\u2212 1\nyj\n(z i+Q(z)). (26)\nEquation (25) describes the per-period utility of a type-j buyer. The first term reflects\nthe utility arising from Walrasian market consumption. Equation (26) gives the expected\nutility of search market consumption net of cost (price as well as liquidity cost due to the\ndepreciation of the value of money).\nIn the next proposition we characterize the equilibrium distribution of money holdings\nwith heterogeneous buyers. Let Fj(\u00b7) denote the distribution of real balances and Zj \u2261\nsuppFj(\u00b7) \u2282 [zj, zj] denote the support of that distribution for each type j. The aggregate\ndistribution of money balances is given by F (z) = \u03b1H FH(z)+\u03b1L FL(z) where suppF \u2282 [0, z].\nSimilarly, define the ratio of type-j buyers to sellers by \u03bbj \u2261 \u03b1j \u03bb.\nProposition 4.1 In equilibrium zL = zH , suppFL(\u00b7) = [0, zL] and suppFH(\u00b7) = [zL, zH ].\nThe equilibrium distributions of real money holdings are given by\nFL(z) =\n1\n\u03bbL\nlog[1\u2212 e\u03bbL i ln(1\u2212 z\nyL u\n)], \u2200 z \u2208 ZL = [0, zL], (27)\nFH(z) =\n1\n\u03bbH\nlog[1\u2212 e\u03bbH i ln( yH u\u2212 z\nyH u\u2212 zL )] \u2200 z \u2208 ZH = [zL, zH ], (28)\nwhere zL = yL u (1\u2212 e\u2212e\u2212\u03bbH (1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbL )\/i) and zH = yH u (1\u2212 e\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbH )\/i) + zL e\u2212(1\u2212e\u2212\u03bbH )\/i.\nProof. Define W\u02c6 j(z) \u2261 yj W j(z) and V\u02c6 j(z) \u2261 yj V j(z) to obtain the system of equations\nW\u02c6 j(z) = z \u03b3\/\u03b4 + yj U\n\u2217\nj +max\nz\u2032\n[\u2212z\u2032 \u03b3\/\u03b4 + \u03b2 V\u02c6 j(z\u2032)]\nV\u02c6 j(z) = z + \u03b4 W\u02c6 j(0) +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPn [yj u F (z)\nn \u2212\n\u222b z\n0\nz\u02dc dF (z\u02dc)n].\nThis is identical to an economy where the valuations in the search market are given by\nu\u02c6j = (yj u), except for Walrasian market consumption (yj U\n\u2217\nj ) which, however, does not\naffect any monetary decisions.\nAn argument similar to proposition 3.1 shows that suppF = [0, z] and F (\u00b7) is non-atomic\non [0, z\u2217L) \u222a (z\u2217L, z\u2217H). Buyer optimization implies that V\u02c6 j\u2032(z) = \u03b3\/(\u03b2 \u03b4) when z \u2208 Zj and (as\nin (10)) the derivative of V\u02c6 j(\u00b7) on the interior of Zj is given by:\nV\u02c6 j\u2032(z) = 1 + (u\u02c6j \u2212 z) \u03bb F \u2032(z) e\u2212\u03bb (1\u2212F (z)), for z \u2208 int(Zj).\n20\nIt is immediate that V\u02c6 H\u2032(z) > V\u02c6 L\u2032(z) which implies that every low type buyer holds less\nmoney that any high type buyer and hence ZL = [0, zL] and ZH = [zL, z].\nThe search market value functions for the two types of agents are given by\nV\u02c6 L(z) = \u03b4 W\u02c6L(z) + e\u2212\u03bbH\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPLn [uL FL(z)\nn \u2212\n\u222b z\n0\nz\u02dc dFL(z\u02dc)\nn]\nV\u02c6 H(z) = \u03b4W\u02c6H(z) + e\u2212\u03bbH\n\u221e\u2211\nn=0\nPLn [uH \u2212\n\u222b zL\n0\nz\u02dcdFL(z\u02dc)\nn] +\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\nPHn [uHFH(z)\nn \u2212\n\u222b z\n0\nz\u02dcdFH(z\u02dc)\nn]\nwhere P jn is the probability that n buyers of type j visit the same seller. To get (27) and (28)\nwe replicate the steps of proposition 3.2 noting that the initial conditions and upper bounds\nfor the two distributions are given by FL(0) = 0, FL(zL) = 1, FH(zL) = 0 and FH(zH) = 1.\nThe following proposition states and proves our distributional results. Note that so long\nas the entry cost K is not too high then the buyer-seller ratio at the Friedman rule is above\nthe threshold derived in the proposition.\nProposition 4.2 Per-period utility declines with inflation for all buyers. It decreases more\nfor high type buyers than for low type buyers if and only if the buyer-seller ratio is below a\nthreshold.\nProof. The fact that low productivity buyers are indifferent between holding 0 or zL dollars\nimplies XL = u P (0) = u P (zL)\u2212 [zL i+Q(zL)]\/yL. Rearranging yields\nzL i+Q(zL) = yL u [P (0)\u2212 P (zL)] (29)\nSince both L- and H-buyers are willing to hold zL dollars we can insert (29) into (26) and\nevaluate at z = zL for both types:\nXL = u P (zL)\u2212 u [P (zL)\u2212 P (0)] (30)\nXH = u P (zL)\u2212 u [P (zL)\u2212 P (0)] yL\nyH\n(31)\nEquations (30) and (31) are useful because they incorporate the equilibrium decisions of\nmoney holdings in a succinct way.\nNote that P (0) = e\u2212\u03bb and P (zL) = e\u2212\u03b1H\u03bb since a buyer with no money can only purchase\nif no one else visits the same seller, while a buyer with zL dollars can outbid all L-buyers\nbut is outbid by all H-buyers. As a result, the buyers\u2019 period utility is a function of the\nbuyer-seller ratio alone which means that a higher inflation rate entails no utility loss for\n21\nbuyers if the number of sellers is fixed. Since sellers have a participation decision, higher\ninflation implies that there are fewer sellers in the market and hence a higher \u03bb. In this case,\nall buyers are worse off because the probability of consuming decreases regardless of type or\nmoney holdings.\nTo compare which type is hurt more by inflation we take the derivative of per-period\nutility with respect to \u03bb:\ndXL\nd\u03bb\n= \u2212u e\u2212\u03bb and dXH\nd\u03bb\n= \u2212u [e\u2212\u03bb yL\nyH\n+ e\u2212\u03b1H\u03bb (1\u2212 yL\nyH\n) \u03b1H ].\nThe last step is to compare\ndXL\nd\u03bb\n<\ndXH\nd\u03bb\n\u21d4 1 > \u03b1H e(1\u2212\u03b1H) \u03bb \u2261 T (\u03bb). (32)\nClearly, T (0) = \u03b1H < 1, T (\u221e) = \u221e > 1, T \u2032(\u03bb) > 0 which means that there is a unique\n\u03bb(\u03b1H) such that the two derivatives are equal. When \u03bb < \u03bb(\u03b1H), the low-productivity\nbuyers are hurt more from inflation than high-productivity buyers and vice versa. Also,\nlim\u03b1H\u21920 \u03bb(\u03b1H) = \u221e and condition (32) always holds when \u03bb < 1 since \u03b1H e(1\u2212\u03b1H) \u2264 1 for\nall \u03b1h \u2208 [0, 1].\n5 Conclusions\nWe develop a monetary model that can be used to examine the effects of inflation across\nheterogeneous agents by accommodating the presence of private information in a tractable\nway. Applying our framework to an environment with two productivity types we show that\ninflation is a regressive form of taxation, at least for moderate levels of money growth.\nWe model decentralized exchange in a different way from most of the literature. Agents\nmatch multilaterally, allowing auctions to be used as a way of allocating goods leading to the\naccommodation of private information. We use second-price auctions for convenience. We\nconjecture that our qualitative results obtain when sellers use any standard auction. The\npossibility of a mass point in the money distribution can be disproved in much the same\nway as in this paper. The fact that there are no liquidity costs at the Friedman rule means\nthat revenue equivalence across auctions holds leading to efficient entry regardless of which\nauction is used. In fact, if sellers can post any direct mechanism in order to compete for\nbuyers, at the Friedman rule they would (in equilibrium) all post a second price auction\nwithout reserve (see McAfee (1993) or Peters (1997)). Regardless of the auction type, higher\ninflation results in positive liquidity costs which leads agents to lower their money holdings\n22\ngiving rise to suboptimal entry. Our results on the distributional effects of inflation do not\nsubstantially depend on the precise pricing mechanism, which leads us to believe that they\nwill not be affected by changing the auction format.\nAn important assumption of our model is the indivisibility of goods (multiple indivisible\ngoods per seller can be accommodated by multi-unit auctions as in Demange, Gale and\nSotomayor (1986), for which we expect qualitatively similar results). The underlying idea is\nthat for many products, especially large ticket items, the non-convexities that are present in\nconsumption lead to indivisibilities. One way to introduce an intensive margin is to make\nthe quality of the good an endogenous choice for the seller at the match and allow buyers\nto offer price-quality bids, competing in terms of the surplus that they leave to the seller.\nTo the extent that the highest bidder is awarded the good (of now endogenous quality),\nwe believe that our principal results will not be substantially affected. An alternative is\nsuggested by Dutu, Julien and King (2007) who let sellers choose and advertise their quality\nlevel in a directed search framework and then run a second price auction with the buyers\nwho visit them. A different route is to introduce lotteries. This would be a useful exercise\nsince the trade-offs are quite different than in the current model. However, lotteries are not\nwell-studied in the context of auctions and hence we leave this topic to future research.\nReferences\n[1] Albanesi, Stefania. \u201cInflation and Inequality.\u201d Journal of Monetary Economics, 54\n(2007), 1088-1114.\n[2] Burdett, Kenneth, and Kenneth Judd. \u201cEquilibrium Price Dispersion.\u201d Econometrica,\n51 (1983), 955-969.\n[3] Burdett, Kenneth, and Dale T.
