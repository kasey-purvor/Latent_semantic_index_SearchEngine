INTRODUCTION\nSpin dynamics in semiconductors have been studied ex-\ntensively, because of their importance for the development of\nspintronic devices.1 Due to its very well established growth\nand the band-gap energy being within the range of widely\navailable ultrafast Ti:sapphire oscillators, most investigations\nhave been focused on bulk or heterostructures of GaAs-based\nsemiconductors.2\nNarrow-gap semiconductors \u0001NGS\u0002 are of particular inter-\nest in terms of potentially important device applications in-\nvolving infrared detectors and long-wavelength optoelec-\ntronic devices. Additionally very high speed electronic\ntransistor devices have been made from NGS due to their\nhigh electron mobility.3 NGS materials could be also very\nbeneficial for designing future spintronic devices because of\ntheir strong spin-orbit coupling. The presence of space-\ncharge accumulation or inversion layers at the surfaces of\nHg1\u2212xCdxTe \u0001x\u00030.3\u0002, InAs, InSb, and InAs1\u2212xSbx could be\nused to design a contact with metallic materials without a\nsignificant resistance mismatch and consequent need for\nSchottky barrier.4 This makes them potential candidates for\napplications utilizing spin injection from ferromagnetic met-\nals. The effect of surface accumulation due to a native sur-\nface defect above the bulk conduction band edge is known to\nbe particular strong with InAs \u0001Refs. 5\u20137\u0002 and Hg1\u2212xCdxTe.8\nElectron spin relaxation strongly depends on the scattering\nrate and electron kinetic energy. Thus layers with different\ncarrier concentration and mobility have different spin life-\ntime and different spin relaxation processes could dominate.\nIn this paper we describe an investigation of the effect of\ninversion layers on the spin-dynamic properties of InAs films\ngrown on semi-insulating GaAs substrates by molecular-\nbeam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002.\nII. SPIN DYNAMICS\nThere are three main spin relaxation processes:\nD\u2019ykonov-Perel\u2019 \u0001DP\u0002,9 Elliot-Yafet \u0001EY\u0002,10 and Bir-Aronov-\nPikus \u0001BAP\u0002.11 The last one is only significant in p-type\nsemiconductors.\nThe EY spin relaxation rate in bulk material is given\nby10,12\n1\n\u0004s\n\u0001EY\u0002 \u0003 A\u0005\n2\u0004 EkEG\u0005\n2 1\n\u0004p\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere the electron kinetic energy Ek, and the momentum\nrelaxation time \u0004p are determined by temperature, concentra-\ntion, and mobility. \u0001For high concentrations, electron-\nelectron scattering may become more important than mobil-\nity scattering.\u0002 The band structure determines \u0005=\u0006\u00011\n\u2212\u0006 \/2\u0002 \/ \u00011\u2212\u0006 \/3\u0002, where \u0006=\u0007 \/ \u0001\u0007+EG\u0002, \u0007 is the spin-orbit\nsplitting of the valence band, and EG is the fundamental en-\nergy gap. A is a dimensionless constant, the value of which\ndepends on the orbital scattering interaction and is predicted\nto be 6 for ionized impurity scattering and 2 for lattice\nscattering.12\nThe DP spin relaxation rate in bulk material is given\nby9,12\n1\n\u0004s\n\u0001DP\u0002 = Q\b2\nEk\n3\n\t2EG\n\u0004p, \u00012\u0002\nwhere \b= \u00014\u0006 \/\u00063\u2212\u0006\u0002\u0001m \/m0\u0002 where m is the electron effec-\ntive mass. Q is a dimensionless factor, predicted to be in the\nranges of 0.8\u20133, depending on the dominant momentum re-\nlaxation process.12 For scattering on ionized impurities and\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 075331 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/74\u00017\u0002\/075331\u00016\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society075331-1\ndefects Q\u000332\/21, whereas for lattice scattering Q\u000396\/35.9\nIn the limit of degenerate statistics the typical electron\nkinetic energy is given by EF, the Fermi energy, and in the\nopposite limit of nondegenerate statistics it is kBT. Therefore\nthe DP dominates at high temperature because of the higher\npower of T in Eq. \u00012\u0002 than in Eq. \u00011\u0002. For semiconductor\nmaterial with high electron mobility the EY mechanism\ndominates only at temperatures below 6 K.12\nAs can be seen from Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 the spin lifetime in\nthe case of the DP relaxation mechanism is inversely propor-\ntional to the electron mobility, whereas in the case of the EY\nmechanism it is linearly proportional. This means that for\nmaterials with low-electron mobility the role of the EY\nmechanism is increased, and the crossover temperature is\nhigher. It has already been demonstrated that for InSb single\nquantum wells with low-electron mobility the crossover be-\ntween DP and EY mechanisms occurs around the electron\nmobility of 1 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and could be achieved at 200 K.13\nFor spintronics applications it is essential not only to have\nlong spin lifetime, but also for the spin-FET the DP process\nshould dominate, because an externally applied electric field\ncan change its magnitude through the Rashba effect.14 This\ngives us the opportunity to control the electron spin lifetime,\nespecially in NGS, which have a large predicted Rashba ef-\nfects. The EY process is not strongly affected by the electric\nfield.\nIII. EXPERIMENT AND RESULTS\nThree undoped InAs films of different thicknesses \u0001d\n=0.15, 0.27, and 1 \u0001m\u0002 were grown on semi-insulating\nGaAs\u0001001\u0002 substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy \u0001MBE\u0002.\nA circularly polarized pump-probe experiment was per-\nformed to study spin dynamics. The induced-transmission\nchange of the probe beam was measured as a function of the\ntime delay between pump and probe pulses having the same\ncircular polarizations \u0001SCP\u0002, and the opposite circular polar-\nizations \u0001OCP\u0002. The optical polarization \u0001SCP\u2212OCP\u0002 \/ \u0001SCP\n+OCP\u0002 is proportional to the spin polarization in the sample.\nThe light source was a difference frequency generator, which\nmixes the signal and the idler beams of an optical parametric\namplifier, itself pumped by an amplified Ti:sapphire oscilla-\ntor. The time resolution of the experiments was about 200 fs.\nA ZnSe photoelastic modulator was used to modulate the\npolarization of the pump beam. The detailed description of\nthe experimental technique is given elsewhere.15 The wave-\nlength was tuned at each temperature to the InAs band edge\nand was in the range of 3\u20133.5 \u0001m \u0001although the laser is\ntime-bandwidth limited to 0.3 \u0001m width anyway\u0002.\nThe decay of spin population at room temperature as a\nfunction of time for undoped InAs films is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe electron-spin lifetime as a function of temperature for all\nsamples is shown in Fig. 2. In addition to thin undoped films,\nthe results for a 3-\u0001m-thick lightly Si-doped \u00015.2\n1016\ncm\u22123\u0002 sample \u0001IC313\u0002 previously used for doping density\ndependence investigations15 are presented as well.\nIV. TRANSPORT PROPERTIES\nAs already mentioned the spin dynamics depend on the\ncharge density and scattering rate. The mobility, \u0001, and sheet\ncarrier concentration, ns, were obtained by Hall measure-\nments in a cloverleaf van der Pauw geometry. Their tempera-\nture dependences in the range T=4\u2013300 K are shown in Fig.\n3. The effective three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 concentration as-\nsuming homogeneous material, n3D, is given by ns \/d and is\nshown for room temperature in Table I.\nHowever, the properties of the InAs films can only be\nfully understood by taking into account the inhomogeneous\ndepth profiles of the carrier concentration and mobility and\nthe resultant parallel conduction paths. The fall and rise of\nthe carrier density \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 is characteristic of material in\nwhich both semiconducting and metallic transport processes\nare occurring. Similar results have been observed for impu-\nrity band conduction in Si and Ge \u0001Ref. 16\u0002 and more re-\ncently in GaN.17\nIn addition to the inhomogeneity near the surface due to\nthe accumulation layer, growth on GaAs substrates produces\ninhomogeneity at the interface. The cross-sectional TEM of\nthe GaAs\/ InAs interface of one of the available samples is\nshown in Fig. 4. The dislocation density in the samples ap-\npears to be very high for approximately the first 0.1 \u0001m of\nFIG. 1.

We note that the semi-insulating GaAs substrates\ndo not themselves contribute to the transport of the samples,\nand have been used for InAs growth because they are readily\navailable, are transparent in the spectral region of interest,\nand offer the possibility of integrating with advanced GaAs\ntechnology.\nAlthough the mobility and density profiles are expected to\nbe smoothly varying, we have considered the InAs films on\nGaAs to consist effectively of three distinct regions: \u0001i\u0002 a\nsurface accumulation layer \u0007or two-dimensional electron gas\n\u00012DEG\u0002\b with high carrier concentration and of order\n0.05 \u0001m thick;18,19 \u0001ii\u0002 an n-type interface layer \u0001at the junc-\ntion with the substrate\u0002 of about 0.1 \u0001m thick, which has a\nhigh dislocation density, is also highly degenerate, and has\nlow mobility; and in between them \u0001iii\u0002 a central region with\ncomparably low carrier concentration and high mobility. We\nidentify the semiconducting component observed in the\ntransport with the central portion of the film, and the inter-\nfaces and surface constitute the metallic regions.\nOur analysis of the mobilities and carrier concentrations\nuses the standard multilayer Hall effect technique, derived\nfrom the basic two-layer method of Petritz.20 In this model,\nthe combined effective sheet carrier density, ns, and average\neffective mobility, \u0001, are related to the sheet densities and\nmobilities in the i component layers, nsi and \u0001i, by\nns\u0001 = \t\ni\nns\ni\u0001i \u00013\u0002\nand\nns\u0001\n2\n= \t\ni\nns\ni\u0001i\n2\n. \u00014\u0002\nThe left-hand sides of Eqs. \u00013\u0002 and \u00014\u0002 are plotted in Fig.\n5. To extract the properties of the semiconducting layer of\neach film, we make two assumptions. First we assume that\nthe metallic layer properties are independent of temperature,\nso that they contribute a constant baseline to Fig. 5. This is\njustified by the fact that the data for the 0.15 \u0001m sample,\nwhich is thin enough to have no semiconducting layer are\nnearly flat. Second, we assume that the semiconducting lay-\ners are frozen out at low temperatures, so that the values of\nthe metallic contributions to Fig. 5 are simply determined by\nthe intercepts. After subtraction of the metallic contribution,\nthe remainder is due to the temperature-sensitive semicon-\nducting region, shown in Fig. 6. The strong temperature de-\npendence of Fig. 5 in the case of the 1 \u0001m film implies\nsignificant transport through the semiconducting layer, in\nspite of the very small concentration in comparison with the\nFIG. 3.

The product n\u0001 is proportional to conductivity, and\none can see from Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002 that the temperature sensitive\nsemiconducting layer carries a maximum of approximately\n30% of the current \u0001for temperatures above \u0003100 K\u0002. By\ncontrast the much weaker temperature sensitivity for the\n0.27 \u0001m film has made the semiconducting properties much\nharder to resolve on top of the temperature-independent me-\ntallic contribution.\nFor the thickest sample, the semiconducting concentration\nfollows an Arrhenius behavior, with an activation energy of\n8 meV, and a room temperature sheet density of 7\n1011\ncm\u22122. Above about 50 K the mobility decreases with tem-\nperature as expected for lattice scattering, though at low tem-\nperatures a switch to impurity scattering is apparent. The\nroom temperature mobility in the thickest film is \n60% of\nthat for bulk material at the same doping level, consistent\nwith the presence of dislocation scattering near to the inter-\nface. The room temperature values of the inferred mobility\nand concentration are given in Table I.\nAt this point we note that to determine the properties of\nthe semiconducting layer in the 1 \u0001m film, instead of sub-\ntracting the assumed metallic contribution as described\nabove, we could have subtracted the experimental values for\nthe 0.27 \u0001m sample to give the properties of a thickness of\n0.87 \u0001m of semiconducting material. Since the values of n\u0001\nand n\u00012 for the assumed metallic layer for the 1 \u0001m film and\nthose determined experimentally for the 0.27 \u0001m film \u0001Fig.\n5\u0002 are nearly equivalent, subtracting either gives almost iden-\ntical results \u0001though the latter gives more scatter\u0002. This gives\nadded confidence in our assumptions. The differential analy-\nsis between layers of different thicknesses, has been used\npreviously for InSb layers.21,22\nWe now attempt to separate the metallic contribution into\nthe surface and interface layer components, though this re-\nquires further assumptions that produce high systematic un-\ncertainty. There is a distinct difference in the 4 K metallic\nproperties between the thinnest film and the two thicker\nones; the latter have approximately half the sheet density and\nfour times the mobility of the former. We attribute this to the\ndefects from the interface layer having propagated far\nenough to affect the surface mobility in the thinnest sample.\nThus the 0.15 \u0001m film can be treated as approximately uni-\nformly defective, so that the mobilities at the interface and\nsurface are similar and equal to the average \u00011.6\n103\ncm2 V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002. If we further assume that all metallic layer\nproperties are independent of film thickness \u0001apart from the\nreduced surface mobility of the thinnest sample\u0002, the best fit\nto the combined metallic contributions deduced above is\ngiven in Table I. The surface 2DEG density is very close to\nFIG. 5.

Symbols are the experi-\nmentally measured data for film thicknesses 0.15 \u0001m \u0001triangles\u0002,\n0.27 \u0001m \u0001circles\u0002, and 1 \u0001m \u0001squares\u0002. The lines are smoothed ver-\nsions of the data used to extrapolate to the intercept.\nFIG. 6. After subtracting the intercepts from Fig. 5, the remain-\ning temperature-dependent contribution can be rearranged to find\nthe sheet density and mobility of the semiconducting layer, shown\nin \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002, respectively. Note in \u0001a\u0002 the reciprocal temperature\non the ordinate axis, and the axis break with different scales either\nside. Symbols are for film thicknesses 0.27 \u0001m \u0001circles\u0002, and 1 \u0001m\n\u0001squares\u0002. For the thick sample the density follows a thermal acti-\nvation behavior \u0001shown by the straight line\u0002 with characteristic tem-\nperature of \n100 K. The error bars include a systematic contribu-\ntion from the uncertainty in the intercepts of Fig. 5 and are,\ntherefore, small only when the semiconducting contribution is large,\ncompared with the metallic contribution. The points at the ends of\nthe temperature scale for the 0.27 \u0001m sample have been removed\nbecause of the large uncertainty.\nLITVINENKO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 74, 075331 \u00012006\u0002\n075331-4\npreviously reported values.19 As already mentioned there is a\nstrong covariance between these parameters and a corre-\nspondingly high systematic uncertainty which we have en-\ndeavored to indicate in Table I.\nThese deductions allow an approximate band-bending\ndiagram to be calculated at 300 K using Poisson\u2019s equation,\nand this is shown in Fig. 7 for the three-layer thicknesses\nstudied. Since the exact charge distribution at the interface is\nunknown, we have represented this by a uniformly doped\nslab 0.1 \u0001m thick, based on the average defected layer thick-\nness, Fig. 4. It can be seen that the overall thickness of the\ninterface layer controls the band edge position in the nomi-\nnally undoped central region, so that this region should ap-\npear more lightly doped in thicker samples. For the thickest\nfilm the semiconducting layer sheet density can be converted\ninto an approximate volume figure of 7\n1015 cm\u22123 by using\na thickness of 0.85 \u0001m for the central region, estimated from\nFig. 7. For the intermediate thickness sample, using a central\nlayer thickness of 0.10 \u0001m, we obtain an increased volume\ndensity of 2\n1016 cm\u22123 because of the increased influence\nof the accumulation layers.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe time evolution of the spin population of electrons in\nthe thick, doped sample \u0001IC313\u0002 can be described by a single\nexponential decay with no evidence of the multiple compo-\nnents in the decay that might be expected if several layers of\ndifferent properties are important. It was found that the DP\nprocess is the dominant spin-relaxation mechanism in the\ntemperature range from 77 to 290 K, and that the EY process\npredicts a much longer lifetime than that observed.15 The\ntemperature dependence is less strong than that predicted by\nsubstituting Ek=kBT into Eq. \u00012\u0002 because the Fermi energy is\nvery close to the band edge, so that the electron distribution\nis not fully Boltzmann-like.\nThe 1 \u0001m film also exhibits a single exponential spin\ndecay and similar temperature dependence. This suggests\nthat the spin lifetime in 1 \u0001m sample is also due to spin\norientation in the bulklike region. The 0.27 \u0001m film is found\nto have two exponential decays in the spin population \u0001Fig.\n1\u0002, and because of its similar magnitude to the thicker sample\nresults we assume that the longer lifetime component is due\nto the central semiconducting layer.\nThe thin film results and the short component of the spin\nlifetime of 0.27 \u0001m film are very similar \u0001see Figs. 1 and 2\u0002\nwhich suggests that they have the same origin. There is no\nsemiconducting central region in the 0.15 \u0001m film so the\ndynamics must relate to the higher concentration regions.\nThe Fermi energy of the surface inversion layer \u0001of all films\u0002\nis about 300 meV \u0001see Fig. 7\u0002, corresponding to a large\nMoss-Burstein-shift in the absorption edge. Consequently\noptical creation of a spin population there is not possible. In\naddition, while the surface-layer densities are assumed simi-\nlar, the mobilities differ by more than a factor of 3 between\nsamples, so if this layer were responsible for the observed\ndynamics, a large difference in magnitude would be seen. On\nthe other hand, the parameters of the electrons in the inter-\nface layers are assumed to be the same \u0001EF\n60 meV\u0002, and\nwe, therefore, identify the short spin relaxation component\nwith this layer. The Fermi energy is high in this layer, which\nreduces the absorption due to the Moss-Burstein shift, but\ndoes not forbid optical injection completely, especially in the\npresence of a strong laser pulse. The relative contribution of\nthe interface layer into a pump-probe signal becomes smaller\nfor thicker samples. That is why we could only see one com-\nponent in the 1 \u0001m film.\nBefore interpreting the temperature dependences of the\nshort spin lifetimes, let us return to more detail consideration\nof spin-relaxation mechanisms. As has already been men-\ntioned, the EY mechanism is linearly proportional to the mo-\nbility, whereas the DP mechanism is inversely proportional\nto \u0001. The crossover between two mechanisms occurs at\nFIG. 8. Spin lifetime as a function of the electron mobility for\ndifferent electron densities. The experimental data are the room\ntemperature values from Fig. 2 using the same symbols. The lines\nrepresent theoretical predictions using Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002. At the left\n\u0001low mobility\u0002 EY dominates Eq. \u00011\u0002, and on the right DP domi-\nnates Eq. \u00012\u0002. For the nondegenerate model at 300 K \u0001Ek=kT\n=25 meV\u0002, appropriate for the central semiconducting region, two\nversions of the DP prediction are shown for lattice scattering and\nfor ionized impurity scattering. For the degenerate models appro-\npriate for the interface \u0001Ek=EF=60 meV\u0002 and surface \u0001Ek=EF\n=300 meV\u0002 we assumed ionized impurity scattering dominates. The\npredicted surface spin lifetime \u0001\u0001=5\n103 cm V\u22121 s\u22121\u0002 is 0.02 ps\n\u0001extrapolating the EF=300 meV curve\u0002.\nFIG. 7.

We have summarized these con-\nclusions in Fig. 8.\nExtrapolating the degenerate EY process to EF=300\nmeV, the spin lifetime in the surface layers can be estimated.\nIt is found that at room temperature the spin lifetime of the\nelectrons in the surface layer is around 0.02 ps. The sensitiv-\nity of our experiment is not enough to detect this short time.\nSuch a short spin lifetime for the surface layer would not\nhave such serious implication for spintronic devices were it\nnot for the fact that conductivity values produced from the\ntransport analysis \u0001Figs. 5 and 6\u0002 show that the majority of\nthe current flows through this layer. Conductivity values\n\u0001\u000bns\ni\u0001i\u0002 calculated from Table I show that even for the thick-\nest film studied \u00011 \u0001m\u0002, the semiconducting region, only car-\nries 30% of the total current, with 10% flowing through the\ninterface layer and a majority 60%, through the surface ac-\ncumulation layer. Taken together, these facts appear to rule\nout the usefulness of InAs for spintronic application.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we have measured the dependence of spin\nrelaxation time at the temperature range from 77 to 300 K\nfor undoped InAs films of different thicknesses from 0.15 to\n1 \u0001m. The spin relaxation has several components, and mir-\nrors the transport. The transport properties of InAs films\nwere analyzed by means of the parallel conductivity model.\nThe spin lifetime is very different in the different layers, due\nto the difference in the mobility and concentration. It was\nshown that while D\u2019Yakonov-Perel spin dephasing domi-\nnates in the low concentration, high mobility semiconducting\nregion in the center of the films, in the low mobility high\nconcentration accumulation layers, Eliott-Yafet spin-flip re-\nlaxation dominate, even at room temperature. The spin life-\ntime in the surface layers was estimated to be much shorter\nthan 1 ps.\n1 M. Ziese and M. J. Thornton, Spin Electronics \u0001Springer-Verlag,\nNew York, 2001\u0002.\n2 D. D.
