However, most of the existing investigations\nto study the structural behaviour and strength of deep\nbeams have focused on single-span deep beams and\nvery little published data1\u20134 exist on continuous deep\nbeams. As a result, their main design codes based on\ntest results of simply supported deep beams or on con-\ntinuous shallow beams, such as ACI 318\u2013995 and CIR-\nIA Guide 2,6 have been found to be inadequate in the\ncase of continuous deep beams.1\u20133\nFailure mechanisms for continuous deep beams are\nsignificantly different from those for simply supported\ndeep beams. The conventional elastic beam theory,\nwhich is applicable to slender beams, is not able to\npredict the behaviour of continuous deep beams owing\nto high shear deformation and non-linear strain distri-\nbution across the deep beam section. The region of\nhigh moment and high shear in continuous deep beams\ncoincides and failure usually occurs in this region,\nwhereas in simply supported deep beams, high shear\nand high moment occur at different locations. The\ncoexistence of high shear and high moment in contin-\nuous deep beams as pointed out by Rogowsky et al.3\nand the development of tensile strains in longitudinal\ntop and bottom reinforcement could cause a significant\nreduction in the effective strength of concrete struts,\nwhich are the main load transfer element in deep\nbeams.\nIt is well known that size effect occurs in concrete\nbeams without shear reinforcement failing in shear; that\nis, shear strength decreases as the size of beam in-\ncreases.7\u201311 However, several hypotheses were devel-\noped to explain the effect of size on shear strength of\nconcrete beams. Taylor10 showed that aggregate inter-\nlock across shear cracks substantially contributes to the\nshear strength. As a result, increasing the beam size,\nwhile keeping the aggregate size constant, should inevi-\ntably cause a decrease of the aggregate interlock\ncontribution and, consequently, a decrease in shear\nstrength. On the other hand, Baz \u02c7ant et al.7,8 and Walra-\nven and Lehwalter11 proposed that fracture mechanics\nwould describe the size effect in concrete structure fail-\ning owing to diagonal shear. Based on non-linear frac-\nture mechanics theory, Baz \u02c7ant and Kim8 developed a\nsize effect formula to consider the decrease in shear\nstrength as the beam depth increases; this formula is\nadopted to modify the concrete properties used in the\nmechanism analysis presented in the current paper. Test\nresults of simple deep beams performed by Tan and\nLu12 and Yang et al.13 showed that with the increase of\nsection depth, the ultimate strength significantly de-\ncreased and the ACI 318\u201399 predictions became un-\nconservative.\nIn the present paper, test results of 12 two-span\nreinforced concrete deep beams are reported. The influ-\nence of section depth on the ultimate shear strength\naccording to the variation of concrete strength and\nshear span-to-overall depth ratio in continuous deep\nbeams is compared with that in the corresponding sim-\nple ones. Also a numerical technique based on the\nupper-bound plasticity theory, considering size effect is\nproposed.\nSignificance of research\nMost existing tests on deep beams have concentrated\non simply supported beams having scaled section depth\nbelow 600 mm. The test results reported in the current\npaper show that the influence of section depth on the\nstructural behaviour and ultimate strength is more pro-\nnounced on continuous deep beams than simple ones\nand on beams having higher concrete compressive\nstrength.\nTest specimens\nThe details of geometrical dimensions and reinforce-\nment for test specimens are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1.\nMain variables investigated were beam depth, h, ranged\nfrom 400 mm to 720 mm, compressive strength of con-\ncrete, f 9 c, and shear span-to-overall depth ratio, a=h.\nThe beams tested were classified into two groups ac-\ncording to the concrete compressive strength: L-\nseries for concrete design strength of 27 MPa and H-\nseries for concrete design strength of 60 MPa. The shear\nspan-to-overall depth ratios, a=h, were initially designed\nto be 0.5 and 1.0 to allow comparisons of current results\nwith those reported by Yang et al.13 for simple deep\nbeams. However, a=h in H-series was increased from\n0.5t o0 .6, as the load capacity of beams having f9 c of\n60 MPa and a\/h ratios of 0.5 had exceeded the capacity\nof the loading machine in the pilot test. The beam nota-\ntion given in Table 1 includes three parts. The first part\nrefers to concrete strength: L for low concrete strength\nand H for high concrete strength. The second part is\nused to identify the shear span-to-overall depth ratio and\nthe third part gives the section overall depth in cm. For\nexample, L5\u201360 is a continuous deep beam having a\nlow concrete strength, shear span-to-overall depth ratio\nof 0.5 and overall depth of 600 mm.\nAll tested beams had the same section width and\nlongitudinal reinforcement ratio: the section width, bw,\nwas 160 mm and longitudinal top and bottom reinforce-\nment ratios were 1%. The total length of test specimens\nvaried according to the a\/h ratio as given in Table 1.\nThe distance between the soffit of beams and centre of\nlongitudinal reinforcement was 45 mm for beams hav-\ning section depths of 400 mm and 600 mm, and 67 mm\nfor beams with section depth of 720 mm. The long-\nitudinal bottom reinforcement was continuous over the\nYang et al.\n576 Magazine of Concrete Research, 2007, 59, No. 8full length of the beam and welded to 160 3\n100 3 10 mm end plates to provide sufficient ancho-\nrage. The longitudinal top reinforcement was anchored\nwithin the outside of exterior supports by 908 hooks\naccording to ACI 318\u20130514 as shown in Fig. 1. To\nexamine the influence of the size effect on concrete\ncontinuous deep beams, no shear reinforcement was\nprovided.\nMaterial properties\nFigure 2 shows the stress\u2013strain relationship of the\n19 mm diameter steel reinforcing bar used in test speci-\nmens. The ingredients of ready-mixed concrete were\nordinary Portland cement, fly ash, irregular gravel of a\nmaximum size of 25 mm and sand. The water\/binder\nratios of L-series added with fly ash of 12% and of H-\nseries added with fly ash of 20% were 0.41 and 0.27,\nrespectively. All specimens were cast in a vertical posi-\ntion in the same wooden mould. Control specimens of\n100 mm diameter 3 200 mm high cylinder were cast\nand cured simultaneously with beams in order to deter-\nmine the compressive strength of concrete. The results\nof the compressive strength, f 9 c, given in Table 1 are\nthe average value of testing nine cylinders soon after\neach beam test.\nTest set-up\nLoading and support arrangements are shown in Fig.\n3. All beams having two spans were tested to failure\nunder two-point symmetrical top loads with loading\nrate of 3 kN\/min using a 3000 kN capacity universal\ntesting machine. One beam span was identified by E-\nspan and the other as W-span, as shown in Fig. 1. The\ntwo exterior end supports are designed to allow hori-\nzontal and rotational movements, whereas the inter-\nmediate support prevents horizontal movement but\nallows rotation. In order to evaluate the shear force and\nloading distribution, 1000 kN capacity load cells were\ninstalled in both exterior supports.

The beam surface was whitewashed to\naid the observation of crack development during test-\ning. After each load increment, the load was kept con-\nstant while cracks were marked and photographed. The\ninclined crack width of concrete struts joining the\nedges of load and support plates was monitored by the\n -shaped displacement transducers (PI gauges) as\nshown in Fig. 3. The strains in longitudinal top and\nbottom reinforcement were measured by 5 mm electri-\ncal resistance strain gauges (ERSs) bonded at spacing\nof 50 mm and 100 mm along the bar length in beams\nhaving a=h \u00bc 0.5 and a=h \u00bc 1.0, respectively. At each\nload increment, the test data were captured by a data\nlogger and automatically stored.\nSupport settlements\nContinuous deep beams are sensitive to differential\nsupport settlements, causing additional moment and\nshear in structural members. To assess the effect of\ndifferential settlements on beams tested, a linear 2D FE\nanalysis considering shear deformation effect was per-\nformed on beams shown in Fig. 1. For the beams tested,\nthe sources of relative support settlements were the\nelastic shortening of the load cell and plates, and elastic\ndeformation of the bed of the testing machine. The\nsecond moment of area of the testing machine bed\ncross-section about the bending axis is 3.2 3 1010 mm4,\n4, then the elastic deformation under a point load R (in\nkN) at a distance 1500 mm from the centre of testing\nmachine is 0.000176R mm. The amount of elastic\nshortening owing to a load at the exterior and inter-\nmediate supports involving the load cell and plates was\nconsidered in designing the support size. When a=h\nratio is 0.5, the reactions of the exterior and intermedi-\nate supports owing to the total applied load P, from the\nlinear 2D FE analysis, are 0.2P and 0.6P, respectively.\nAs the height of the intermediate support is equal to\nthat of the exterior load cell, the section area of the\nintermediate support was designed to be three times\nwider than that of the load cell at the exterior support\nto produce the same elastic shortening. Fig. 4 shows\nthe result of support settlement recorded from a pilot\ntest. The maximum settlement of the exterior support\nrelative to the intermediate support was in order of L\/\n25000.

This indicates that the\ndifferential settlement had no significant effect on the\ntest arrangement.\nTest results\nCrack propagation and failure mode\nThe total load and shear force at the development of\nthe first flexural and shear cracks and crack pattern at\nfailure in L-series are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5,\nrespectively. The failure modes and crack pattern in H-\nseries were similar to those in L-series but lager failure\nzone. Just before failure, the two spans showed nearly\nthe same crack patterns. The crack pattern development\nwas significantly influenced by both a=h ratio and\nsection depth. For a=h \u00bc 0.5, the first diagonal crack\ndeveloped suddenly at about 40% of the load capacity\nat the mid-depth of the concrete strut within the interior\nshear span, and then the first flexural crack in the\nsagging region immediately followed. The first flexural\ncrack over the intermediate support generally occurred\nat about 80% of the ultimate load capacity, and its\ndevelopment height up to failure ranged between 0.2h\nand 0.4h. As the load increased, more flexural and\ndiagonal cracks were formed and a diagonal crack\nextended to join the edges of the load and intermediate\nsupport plates. A diagonal crack within the exterior\nshear span suddenly occurred near to the failure load.\nFor beams having a=h \u00bc 1.0, the first crack developed\nvertically in the hogging zone, followed by a diagonal\ncrack in the interior shear span and then a vertical\ncrack in the sagging zone. Diagonal cracks within the\nexterior shear span are seldom developed, exhibiting\ndifferent crack patterns from that observed in beams\nwith a=h \u00bc 0.5. The height and average spacing of the\nsagging and hogging flexural cracks up to failure were\nfrom 0.6h to 0.8h and 50 mm, respectively.\nWith the increase of h, the number of cracks formed\ndecreased and their depth was also reduced because of\nthe increase of the energy release rate and expansion of\ncrack width, which caused brittle failure, as described\nby Baz \u02c7ant and Planas7 and given by Fig. 6, which\nshows the development of diagonal crack width. The\ndiagonal crack width of H6\u201372 and H10\u201372 beams are\nnot presented in Fig. 6 as the PI gauges were damaged\nwhen diagonal cracks occurred. The width of diagonal\ncracks which occurred within the interior shear span\nextended up to 0.6\u20131.5 mm at failure. The shear span-\nto-overall depth ratio had a significant influence on the\ndevelopment of diagonal crack width. As the load in-\ncreased, widening of the diagonal crack greatly in-\ncreased with the increase of shear span-to-overall depth\nratio. All beams having a=h \u00bc 1.0 failed soon after the\ndevelopment of the diagonal crack between the edges\nof the applied load and intermediate support plates.\nWhereas for beams having a=h \u00bc 0.5, the diagonal\ncrack width increased with the increase of section over-\nall depth. With the increase of diagonal crack width,\nthe load transfer by frictional effect and aggregate\ninterlock is reduced, showing the influence of the beam\nsize as described by Reineck.15\nAll beams exhibited the same mode of failure as\nobserved in other experiments.1 At failure, an end\nblock formed because of the significant diagonal crack\nconnecting the edges of the load and intermediate sup-\nport plates and rotated about the exterior support, leav-\nTable 2.

The observed failure mode\nsuggests that the mechanism analysis, presented later in\nthe current paper, appears very promising in predicting\nthe load capacity of such beams.\nLoad\u2013displacement curves\nThe mid-span deflections of failed span for different\nbeams tested against the total applied load are given in\nFig. 7: Fig. 7(a) for beams in L-series and Fig. 7(b) for\nbeams in H-series. The initial stiffness of beams having\nthe same a=h ratio seems to be independent of the\nbeam overall depth. Also, the development of flexural\ncracks in sagging and hogging zones had little influ-\nence on the stiffness of the beams tested. However, the\ndevelopment of diagonal cracks caused a sharp increase\nto the beams deflections; the stiffness reduction was\nespecially prominent with the increase of shear span-to-\noverall depth ratio.\nSupport reactions\nFigure 8 shows the amount of the load transferred to\nthe exterior and intermediate supports against the total\napplied load in L-series. On the same figure, the sup-\nport reactions obtained from a linear 2D FE analysis\nare also presented. The support reactions obtained from\nthe linear 2D FE analysis are independent of the beam\noverall depth and shear span-to-overall depth ratio. The\ndistribution of reactions in H-series beams was similar\nto that of L-series beams; therefore not presented here.\nUp to the development of the first diagonal crack with-\nin the interior shear span, the support reaction against\nthe total applied load in all beams shows good agree-\nment with the results obtained from the linear 2D FE\nanalysis. However, after the first diagonal crack within\nthe interior shear span, the amount of loads transferred\nto exterior support was a slightly higher than that\npredicted by the linear 2D FE analysis. The maximum\ndifference between the experimental and the linear 2D\nFE analytical support reactions increased by up to 10%.\nThis indicates that, although the deep beam has a\nsmaller stiffness after the development of the diagonal\ncrack, the internal redistribution of forces is limited.\nUltimate shear stresses\nThe effect of the beam depth, h, on the relative ulti-\nmate shear stress (vn)=(vn)h\u00bc400mm is given in Fig. 9.\nThe given relative ultimate shear stress is the normal-\n(a) (b)\nL5 40 \u0003\nW E\nL10 40 \u0003\nW E\nL5 60 \u0003\nW E\nL10 60 \u0003\nW E\nL5 72 \u0003\nW E\nL10 72 \u0003\nW E\nFig. 5.

The data of\nsimple deep beams shown in Fig. 9 were quoted from\nthe test results of Yang et al.,13 which had the same\nmaterial and geometrical properties as the continuous\ndeep beams given in Fig. 1. As section depth increased,\nthe ultimate shear stress gradually decreased. This de-\ncreasing rate is higher in H-series beams than in that of\nL-series beams. The influence of section depth on the\nstructural behaviour of beams was more pronounced in\ncontinuous deep beams than in simple ones. This indi-\ncates that the flexural cracks in the sagging and hog-\nging regions and the development of tensile strains of\nthe longitudinal top and bottom reinforcement have a\ngreater influence on the reduction of the effective\nstrength of concrete struts within the interior shear\nspan. The test results of simple deep beams performed\nby Tan and Lu12 and Yang et al.13 showed that the ACI\n318\u2013995 predictions became more unconservative with\nthe increase of section depth. As size effect of contin-\nuous reinforced concrete deep beams is more notable,\nit can be concluded that the shear provision of the ACI\n318\u201399 is also inadequate in the case of continuous\ndeep beams.\nStrain distribution of longitudinal reinforcement\nFigures 10 and 11 show the variation of strains in the\nlongitudinal top and bottom reinforcement of the beams\ntested against the total applied load, respectively. How-\never, strains in the longitudinal top and bottom reinfor-\ncement were recorded at 50 mm and 100 mm spacing\nfor beams having a=h \u00bc 0.5 and 1.0, respectively; only\nstrains at the regions crossing the diagonal crack devel-\noped between the edges of the load and intermediate\nsupport plates are presented as those were the highest\nstrains measured. Although both top reinforcement in\nthe sagging region and bottom reinforcement in the\nhogging region experienced compressive strains until\nbefore the first diagonal cracking load, their strains\nmoved dramatically to tensile strains with the occur-\nrence of diagonal cracks. The tensile strain of long-\nitudinal reinforcement developed owing to the tie\naction increased slightly with the increase of h, but at\nno stage did it reach the yield strain given in Fig. 2.\nUpper-bound analysis for ultimate strength\nAs proposed by Ashour and Morley,16 the mechan-\nism of failure for two-span deep beams can be classi-\nfied into two different modes: unsymmetrical collapse\nwhere the diagonal failure plane occurs within only one\nof the two interior shear spans and symmetrical col-\nlapse within the two interior shear spans.

As proposed by Ashour and Morley17 and\nWang et al.,18 a yield line can generally be represented\nas a parabolic line connecting the edges of the load and\nintermediate support plates. As a result, continuous deep\nbeams, at collapse, usually can be idealised as an assem-\nblage of two rigid blocks separated by a yield line. The\nrigid block II is fixed over both the intermediate and\nexterior supports and the other rigid block, rigid block I,\nrotates about an instantaneous centre (IC).\nModelling of materials\nConcrete is modelled as a rigid perfectly plastic\nmaterial obeying the modified Coulomb failure criteria\nwith zero tension cut-off.19 The effective compressive\nstrength, f \nc , to be used in calculation, is obtained from\nthe cylinder compressive strength, f9 c, as follows\nf  \nc \u00bc vef 9 c (1)\nwhere ve is the effectiveness factor that is introduced to\naccount for the limited ductility of concrete and to\nabsorb other shortcomings of applying the theory of\nplasticity to concrete. The effectiveness factor normally\ndepends on material strength and geometrical proper-\nties of reinforced concrete members such as size, shear\nspan-to-depth ratio, amount and configuration of rein-\nforcement, and loading system.16,18,20\nTensile and compressive reinforcement are generally\nassumed as a rigid perfectly plastic material with yield\nstress fy. However, high-strength reinforcement having\nyield stress above 500 MPa may not reach its yield\nstrength if the amount of reinforcement is heavy and\nbearing or local compressive failure in concrete strut is\npreceded. In fact, the shear provision of ACI 318\u20130514\nhas recommended that the value of fy used in design of\nshear reinforcement should not exceed 420 MPa to pro-\nvide ductility and control on diagonal crack width. In\naddition, stresses in all longitudinal reinforcing bars at\nultimate strength of tested beams were below 400 MPa\nas the highest strain recorded was 0.002 as shown in\nFigs 10 and 11. In the current study, therefore, the value\nof fy of reinforcement is limited to 420 MPa.\nWork equation\nThe upper-bound theorem is based on the energy\nprinciple equating the total internal energy, WI, to the\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\n1600\n1800\n2000\nReaction: kN\n(a)\nT\notal load: kN\nLinear 2D FE analysis\nL5 40 \u2013\nL5 60 \u2013\nL5 72 \u2013\nEnd\nsupport\nIntermediate\nsupport\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nReaction: kN\n(b)\nT\notal load: kN\nLinear 2D FE analysis\nL10 40 \u2013\nL10 60 \u2013\nL10 72 \u2013\nEnd\nsupport\nIntermediate\nsupport\nFig. 8.

Because the relative displacement rate,  ,\nequals \u00f8r as shown in Fig. 12, the energy, Wc, dissi-\npated in concrete in the hyperbolic yield line proposed\nby Nielsen19 is\nWc \u00bc\nbwf \nc\n2\n\u00f8r(1   sin\u00c6)\nh\nsin \n(2)\nwhere r is the distance between the midpoint of the\nchord of the yield line and the instantaneous centre; \u00f8\nis the rotational displacement of rigid block I; \u00c6 is the\nangle between the relative displacement at the midpoint\nof the chord and yield line chord; and   is the angle\nbetween the yield line and longitudinal axis as shown\nin Fig. 12. The relative displacement of reinforcement,\n s, can be expressed as \u00f8rs as shown in Fig. 13. There-\nfore the energy, Ws, dissipated in reinforcement cross-\ning the yield line is calculated from\nWs \u00bc\nX n\ni\u00bc1\n\u00f8(As)i(fy)i(rs)i cos(\u00c6s)i (3)\nwhere n is the number of reinforcing bars crossing the\nyield line; (As)i, and (fy)i is the area and yield strength\nof the reinforcing bar i crossing the yield line, respec-\ntively; (rs)i is the distance between the reinforcing bar i\nand the instantaneous centre; and (\u00c6s)i is the angle\nbetween the relative displacement  s about IC and the\nreinforcing bar i crossing the yield line.

Equating\nthe total internal energy dissipated in concrete and\nreinforcement to the external work done, the ultimate\nstrength, Pn, can be written in the following form\nPn \u00bc\nbwh\na\n\"\nf \nc r(1   sin\u00c6)\n1\nsin \n\u00fe 2\nX n\ni\u00bc1\n(rs)i(fy)i(rs)i cos(\u00c6s)i\n# (6)\nwhere (rs)i is the the reinforcement ratio i crossing the\nyield line, which can be calculated from (As)i=bwh.\nEffectiveness factor of concrete\nThe web of deep beams is considered to be in a state\nof biaxial tension\u2013compression. The presence of simul-\ntaneous transverse tensile strain leads to a significant\ndeterioration of the compressive strength of cracked\nconcrete.21 This means that the softening behaviour of\ncracked concrete depends on the material properties\nand the amount of transverse tensile strain in the yield\nline. The softening behaviour has been investigated and\nreviewed in panel tests subjected to biaxial tension\u2013\ncompression by several researchers.21\u201324 In particular,\nVecchio and Collins21 proposed the effectiveness factor\nas a function of the concrete strength and the ratio of\nthe principal strains based on a large number of experi-\nmental data. In the present study, Vecchio and Collins\u2019\nmodel for effectiveness factor was adopted and modi-\nfied to reflect the influence of size effect as follows\nve \u00bc\n \n1:0 \u00fe KcKf\nKc \u00bc 0:35  \n 1\n 3\n  0:28\n   0:8\n> 1:0\nKf \u00bc 0:1825\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\nf9 c\np\n> 1:0\n  \u00bc\n1\n\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03 \ufb03\n1 \u00fe (d=25da)\np\n(7)\nwhere  1 and  3 are the principal tensile and compres-\nsive strains in the yield line, respectively. As the princi-\npal strains  1,3 are (1=2)( =\u02dc)(sin\u00c6   1) in the yield\nline having discontinuous width of \u02dc from the plasticity\ntheory,17,19   1= 3 in the factor Kc can be written as\n1 \u00fe sin\u00c6=1   sin\u00c6. This indicates that the influence of\nthe transverse tensile strain on the effectiveness factor\ncan be determined by the angle \u00c6. The factor   pro-\nposed by Baz \u02c7ant and Kim,8 which is a function of the\neffective depth, d, and maximum size of aggregate, da,\nusing non-linear fracture mechanics and a non-linear\nregression analysis based on hundreds of test data, is to\nconsider the influence of the size effect which is more\nsignificant in continuous deep beams. The size effect in\nreinforced concrete beams should be hardly influenced\nby the shear span-to-depth ratio as discovered by Ba-\nz \u02c7ant and Kim.8 Although the factor   is based on test\nresults of slender beams, its validity is extended here to\ndeep beams.\nSolution procedure\nThe ultimate strength is implicitly expressed as a\nfunction of the position of the instantaneous centre\n(Xic, Yic) as given in equation (6). The horizontal co-\nordinate (Xic) of the instantaneous centre coincides\nwith that of the global coordinates since the vertical\ndisplacement of rigid block I is prevented at the exter-\nior support as shown in Fig. 12. According to the\nupper-bound theorem, the collapse occurs at the least\nstrength. The minimum value of strength is obtained by\nvarying the vertical coordinate (Yic) of the instanta-\nneous centre along the vertical axis of the global co-\nordinate. The process of adjusting the vertical\ncoordinate (Yic), which was programmed using Matlab\nsoftware, is achieved by reliable numerical optimisation\nprocedures.\n() \u03b1s i\n() \u03b4s i\n() rs i\n\u03c9\nReinforcing bar i\nIC ( , ) XY ic ic\nRigid block I\nYield line\nRigid block II\nFig. 13.

The test results of continuous deep beams\ntested by Ashour,1 Rogowsky et al.3 and Subedi,4\nwhich failed in unsymmetrical failure mechanism\nshown in Fig. 12, are also presented in Table 3 and Fig.\n14.

The\npredictions obtained from equation (6) show good\nagreement with experimental results and the ratio\n(Pn)Pro:=(Pn)Exp: remains constant, even though section\ndepth of beams is varied. This indicates that the size\neffect is successfully represented by the effectiveness\nfactor given in equation (7).\nTest results presented in Table 3 showed that the\nnormalised load capacity, \u00ban \u00bc Pn=2bwhf9 c, of beams\ntested by Ashour1 and Rogowsky et al.3 decreased with\nthe increase in the shear span-to-overall depth ratio as\nobserved in the present investigation.

All beams having a=h\n\u00bc 1.0 failed soon after the development of the\ndiagonal crack. Whereas for beams having a=h \u00bc\n0.5, the development rate of the diagonal crack\nwidth increased with the increase of section overall\ndepth.\n(c) The influence of section depth on shear behaviour\nof beams was more pronounced on continuous\ndeep beams than simple ones. Also, the size effect\nwas more prominent in beams having concrete\nstrength of 65 MPa than those having concrete\nstrength of 32 MPa.\n(d) The highest tensile strain recorded in longitudinal\ntop and bottom reinforcement in each beam was at\nthe region crossing diagonal cracks, and it slightly\nincreased with the increase of section depth but did\nnot reach the yield strain.\n(e) The proposed formulae to predict the ultimate\nstrength of two-span continuous deep beams were\nin reasonable agreement with experiments, even\nthough the section depth of beams was varied.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the Korea Research\nFoundation Grant (KRF-2003\u2013041-D00586) and the\nRegional Research Centers Program (Bio-housing Re-\nsearch Institute), granted by the Korean Ministry of\nEducation & Human Resources Development.\nReferences\n1.
