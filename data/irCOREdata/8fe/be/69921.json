Introduction\nThe graphs we consider here are either simple graphs, that is they have no loops or\nmultiple edges, or are multigraphs, that is they may have more than one edge joining a\npair of vertices, but again have no loops. In particular we shall consider a special kind\nof multigraph, called a star-multigraph: this is a multigraph which contains a vertex\nv*, called the star-centre, which is incident with each non-simple edge. An edge-\ncolouring of a multigraph G is a map <\/>: E(G)^>-<\u20ac, where ^ is a set of colours and E(G)\nis the set of edges of G, such that no two edges receiving the same colour have a vertex\nin common. The chromatic index, or edge-chromatic number, x'(G) of G is the least value\nof \\c&\\ for which an edge-colouring of G exista. Generalizing a well-known theorem of\nVizing [14], we showed in [6] that, for a star-multigraph G,\nwhere &(G) denotes the maximum degree (that is, the maximum number of edges\nincident with a vertex) of G. Star-multigraphs for which #'(<?) = A(G) are said to be\nClass 1, and otherwise they are Class 2.\nThis paper is one of several we are writing on star-multigraphs and their appli-\ncations. Star-multigraphs are turning out to be a very useful tool in the study of the\nchromatic index of simple graphs, as well as being of some interest in their own right.\nIn particular, we shall use the results in this paper to obtain further results on the\nchromatic index in [7] and [8]; furthermore, in [11] C. A. Rodger and the second author\napply results in this paper to the study of decompositions of complete graphs and to\ntotally symmetric quasigroups.\nFor n > 4, let K* denote the star-multigraph obtained from Kn by removing one\nedge, say v*v', and doubling two other edges on v*, say v*Vj^ and v*v2. For n ^ 1, let\nK*n denote the star multigraph obtained from Kn by doubling one edge. The main\ntheorem we prove in this paper is:\nTHEOREM 1. Let Gbea connected star multigraph with star-centre v*, with three vertices\nof maximum degree including v*, and with no induced subgraph on three vertices having\nmore than A(G) edges. Then G is Class 2 if and only if either\nor\n(li) G = K*n+1for some n 35 2,\n(1 ii) G has three vertices of degree | V(G) | - i and the remainder have degree \\ V(G) \\ - 2,\n304 A. G. CHETWYND AND A. J . W. H I L T O N\nor\n(1 iii) A(G) = 2m + 1 Js 3 for some integer m, G contains a bridge e, and\nwhere\nand\ni = K*m+i (for m > 2) or G1 = K*2m+1.\nStar multigraphs satisfying (Iii) must have odd order; all simple graphs satisfying\n(1 ii) are obtained from K2n+1 by removing n \u2014 1 independent edges.\nSince no more than [| F((?)|\/2J edges can have the same colour in an edge-coloured\nmultigraph G, if\nthen G is necessarily Class 2. If G satisfies this condition, then G is called overfull. A\nvery common reason for a multigraph to be Class 2 is that it contains an overfull sub-\ngraph H with A(H) = A{G). If\nthen G is called just overfull. A multigraph G is critical if it is connected, Class 2 and\nX'ifi \\e) < x'(G) for all e e E(G). A result which is more or less equivalent to Theorem 1\nis:\nTHEOREM 2. Let Gbea star multigraph with star-centre v* and with at most 3 vertices\nof maximum degree, including v*. Then the following are equivalent:\n(2i) G is critical;\n(2ii) G is just overfull;\n(2 iii) G is one of the following graphs:\n(a) \\V(G)\\ = 3and\\E(G)\\ = A(G)+1 > 3;\n(b) G = K\\n+lfor some n > 1;\n(c) G = K$n+1for some n ^ 2;\n(d) | V(G) | is odd and G has three vertices of degree | F\"(6?)| \u2014 1 and the remainder have\ndegree | F (G) | -2 .\nA conjecture formulated in [3] by Chetwynd and Hilton was:\nCONJECTURE 1. Let 1 < s < n. Let Gbea regular star multigraph on2n + 2 vertices of\ndegree 2n + 1 - s. Suppose G does not contain a subgraph on three vertices with 2n + 2 \u2014 s\nedges. Then G is Glass 1.\nThis was proved for s = 1 or 2 in [3]. Here we show that Conjecture 1 is true for\ns = 3.\nTHEOREM 3. Let 1 < s < 3. Let G be a regular star multigraph on 2n + 2 vertices of\ndegree 2n +1 \u2014 s. Suppose G does not contain a subgraph on three vertices with\n2n + 2 - s edges. Then G is Class 1.\nIn the case when G is a simple graph, Theorem 3 was proved in [5]. Of course, a\nregular star multigraph of odd order is overfull and consequently Class 2.\nWe now turn our attention to simple graphs. We propose the following conjecture.\nStar multigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 305\nCONJECTUBE 2. Let G be a simple graph with A(G) > ^  | V(G)\\. Then G is Class 2\nif and only if G contains an overfull subgraph H with A(G) = A(H).\nPetersen's graph shows that the figure j ^ would be best possible. By applying\nTheorem 1, we prove Theorem 4 below, which verifies Conjecture 2 in one case. This\nparticular case will be of great use in a forthcoming paper by C. A. Rodger and the\nsecond author on triangulating nearly complete graphs [11].\nTHEOREM 4.

Theorem 4 itself will be improved upon,\npartly by removing the restriction on |2\u00a3(6r)|, in [7] and [8].\n2. Preliminary results\nWe now give a number of Lemmas which we shall need to use.\nThe first is due to Chetwynd and Yap [9], extending results of Jakobsen [12] and\nBeineke and Piorini[l]. Let P be the graph obtained from Petersen's graph by\nremoving one vertex (P is an example of a critical graph which is not overfull).\nLEMMA 2-1. Let Gbea simple critical graph with | V(G) | < 10. \/ \/ G =f= P, then G is just\noverfull.\nThe next few lemmas are proved in [6].\nLEMMA 2-2. Let Gbea critical star multigraph with star centre v*, where d(v*) \u2014 A(G),\nand with r vertices of maximum degree. Then\n(2(\\V(G)\\-1)\nif r > 4,\nif r = o.\nLEMMA 2-3. Let Gbea star multigraph with at most two vertices of maximum degree,\nand let G not contain a subgraph on three vertices with A(G) + 1 edges. Then G is Class 1,\nunless, for some n > 2, G = Kln+1.\nLEMMA 2-4. Let Gbea critical star multigraph with star centre v*, where d(v*) = A(G),\nwith r vertices of maximum degree, and with maximum multiplicity of an edge fi. Then\nA(G) < \\V(G)\\+r+fi-5.\nIn a star multigraph G, for each v \u00a3 V(G), let d*(v) be the number of edges joining v\nto vertices of maximum degree.\nLEMMA 2-5. Let Gbea critical star multigraph with star centre v*, where d(v*) = A(G).\nLet u and w be adjacent vertices, w 4= v*. Then\n(A(G) - d(u) +1 if d(u) < A(G),\nif d(u) = A(G).d*lw) ^ \\[\n306 A. G. C H E T W Y N D AND A. J . W. H I L T O N\nLEMMA 2-6. Let G be a star multigraph with star centre v*, where d(v*) = A(6r). Let\nd*(w) < 1 for some we V(G) \\{v*}, let eeE{G) and let e and w be incident. Then\n&(G) = &(G\\w)=>x'(G) = X'(G\\w),\nand\nA(<?) = A(G \\e)=> *'((?) = *'(<? \\e).\nLEMMA 2-7. Let Gbea critical star multigraph with star centre v*, where d(v*) = A((?),\nwith at least three vertices of maximum degree. Then either G is a simple graph of odd order\nwhich is just overfull and with A(6?) = | V(G) | \u2014 1, or there is a vertex which is non-adjacent\nto v*.\nLEMMA 2-8. Let G be a star multigraph. If G is Class 2, then G contains a critical\nsubgraph G* with A(G*) = A(G).\nThe next lemma was proved in [5].\nLEMMA 2-9. Let G be a simple Class 2 graph with three vertices of maximum degree.\nThen | V(G)\\ is odd and G has three vertices of degree \\ V(G)\\ \u2014 1 and the rest have degree\n\\V(G)\\-2.\nThe next lemma is a generalization due to Berge [2] of a well-known theorem of\nChvatal[10] on Hamiltonian circuits.\nLEMMA 2-10. Let Gbea simple graph of order n with degrees dr < d2^ ... < dn. Let q\nbe an integer with 0 ^ q ^ n \u2014 3 and let F be a subgraph of G with \\E(F)\\ = q and such\nthat the components of F are paths. If, for 0 < k < \\{n \u2014 q),\ndk < k + q^dn_k_q ^ n-k,\nthen G contains a Hamiltonian circuit which contains F.\n3. The equivalence of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2\nI t will be of great use in our proof of Theorem 1 if we know that Theorems 1 and 2\nare equivalent to each other. In this section we prove this assertion.\nLEMMA 3-1. Let G be a star multigraph with three vertices of degree \\V{G)\\, where\n\\V{0)\\ is odd and ^ 5, one vertex of degree \\V{G)\\ \u2014 2, and the remainder of degree\n\\V(G)\\-l.ThenG = K$n+1.\nProof. Let v' be the vertex of degree | V[G)\\ \u2014 2. Any vertex non-adjacent to v* has\ndegree at most | V(G)\\ \u2014 2. Therefore each vertex, except possibly v', is adjacent to v*.\nThe three vertices of degree | V{G) | each have at least one multiple edge on them, and\nso v* has maximum degree and is joined to the other two vertices, say vl and v%, of\nmaximum degree by multiple edges. Since d(v*) ^ |F(Cr)|, v* is in fact joined to vx\nand v2 by double edges, is not joined to v', and is joined to all other vertices by single\nedges, &ndd(v*) = |F(6?)|. A vertex Z J ^ J U * , ^ , ^ } is joined to all other vertices. Finally\nvx and v2 are the two other vertices of degree | V(G)\\ and are each joined to all other\nvertices. Therefore G = Kfn+l.\nLEMMA 3-2. Let Gbea star multigraph with star-centre v* and with at most three vertices\nof maximum degree, including v*. IfG is just overfull, then G satisfies (2iii).\nProof. Since G is just overfull, | V(G)\\ is odd, say | V(G) \\ = 2n + 1. If | V(G)\\ = 3 then\nStar multigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 307\nclearly G satisfies (2 iii), so suppose | V(G)\\ > 3. If G has at most two vertices of maxi-\nmum degree, then, by Lemma 2-3, G \u2014 K\\n+1, so again G satisfies (2iii). So now suppose\nthat G has three vertices of maximum degree.\nLet the deficiency, def (G), of G be defined by\ndef(G)= 2 (A(G)-l-d(v)).\nve V(O)\nd(v)<A(G)-l\nThen nA{G) + l = \\E(G)\\\n= |(3A(G) + (2w - 2) (A(G)-l ) -def (<?)).\nTherefore 2nA(G) + 2 = (2n + 1) A(<?) - 2\u00bb + 2 - def (G),\nand so def (<?) = A(G) - 2n. Therefore\nA(G) >2n. (1)\nSince G is a star-multigraph, there are at most I I edges between vertices of\nV(G) \\{v*}. Therefore\nTherefore nA(G) < 2n2 - n - 1 + A(G),\nso that A(G) < 2n+ 1.\nIn view of (1), it now follows that either G has three vertices of degree | V(G)\\, one\nof degree | V{G)\\ \u2014 2, and the rest have degree | V(G)\\ - 1, in which case, by Lemma 3-1,\nG = K%n+1, so that (2iiic) is satisfied, or G has three vertices of degree | V(G)\\ \u2014 1 and\nthe remainder have degree | V(G)\\ \u2014 2, so that (2iiirf) is satisfied.\nThis proves Lemma 3-2.\nFor use in the induction argument in Section 5, we need a more detailed assertion\nthan simply that Theorems 1 and 2 are equivalent to each other. The assertion we\nneed is the following lemma.\nLEMMA 3-3. Let 1 < q < p. Then Theorem 1 is true for \\ V(G)\\ = p and A(G) < q, or for\n| F(#)| < p, if and only if Theorem 2 is true when \\ V(G)\\ = p and A(G) ^ q or when\n\\V(G)\\ <p.\nProof. Both assertions are easily seen to be true if 0 < A(G) ^ 2. Suppose therefore\nthat A{G) > 3.\nThroughout we shall assume that all graphs considered satisfy | V(G)\\ = p and\nA(\u00a3) < q, or \\V(G)\\ <p.\n(I) Suppose first that Theorem 1 is true when | V(G)\\ = p and A(G) < q, or when\nV(G)\\ < p. Then we wish to show Theorem 2 is true when | V(G)\\ = p and A(G) < q,\nor when 17(0)1 < p.\nIf (2 i) is true, so that G is critical, then, from Theorem 1, it is clear that (2 iii) follows.\nIf (2 iii) is true, then it is easy to see that both (2 i) and (2 ii) are true. Finally, if (2 ii) is\ntrue, then it follows from Lemma 3-2 that (2 iii) is true.\n(II) Now suppose that Theorem 2 is true when | V(G)\\ = p and A(G) < q, or when\n\\V(G)\\ <p. Then we wish to show that Theorem 1 is true when \\V{G)\\ =p and\nq, or when | V(G)\\ < p.\n308 A. G. CHETWYND AND A. J. W. HILTON\nSuppose that G satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1. If G satisfies (1 i), (1 ii) or (1 iii)\nthen it is easy to see that G is Class 2. Now suppose that G is Class 2. Then we shall show\n(using Theorem 2) that G satisfies (li), (Iii) or (1 iii). Since G is Class 2, by Lemma 2-8,\nG contains a critical subgraph G* with A(C?*) = A((r). In Theorem 1, we are assuming\nthat G contains no subgraph on three vertices with A(G) +1 vertices. Therefore, by\nTheorem 2, | V(G*)\\ is odd (= 2m + 1, say) and either A((?*) = 2m + 1 and G = K^+x\nfor some m > 1, or A((r*) = 2m +1 and G = Kfm+1 for some m > 2, or G* has three\nvertices of degree 2m and the remainder have degree 2m\u2014 1.\nIn the first case, since we are assuming in Theorem 1 that G has exactly three\nvertices of maximum degree, it follows that | V(G*) \\ < | V(G) \\. Let G2 be the subgraph\nof G induced by V(G)\\V(G*). Then G* and <?2 are connected by a bridge e; thus G\nsatisfies (1 iii) (with G\u00b1 = G*).\nIn the second case, either |F(G*)| = |F(G)|, in which case G satisfies (li) or\n| V(G*)\\ < | V(G)\\. Let G2 be the subgraph of G induced by V{G)\\V(O*). Then, since\nG is connected and has exactly three vertices of maximum degree, G* is joined to G2\nby a bridge e (which is incident with the vertex of degree 2m \u2014 1 in G); thus G again\nsatisfies (liii) (with Gx = G*).\nIn the third case, since G is connected and has exactly three vertices of maximum\ndegree, V(G) = V(G*), so G = G*. Then G satisfies (Iii).\nThis proves Lemma 3-3.\n4. A bound on the maximum degree\nFor a critical star multigraph G, when there are only three vertices of maximum\ndegree, including v*, the bound on A(G) in Lemma 2-4 reduces to\nA(G)< \\V(G)\\+\/i-2,\nwhere \/i is the maximum multiplicity. Our task in this section is to reduce this bound.\nLEMMA 4-1. Let Gbea critical star multigraph with star-centre v* and with three vertices,\nvlt v2, v*, of maximum degree. Then either (i) A((?) < | V(G)\\ \u2014 1 and d(v) ^ A((r) \u2014 1\n(Vwe V(G)) (so that \\ V(G)\\ is odd), or (ii) G = K^n+1for some n>2.\nProof. By Lemma 2-9, if G is a simple graph, then | V{G)\\ is odd and G has three\nvertices of degree | V(G)\\ \u2014 1 and the rest have degree | V{G)\\ \u2014 2. Thus (i) is satisfied.\nTherefore we may suppose that | V(G)\\ is not simple. Then it follows from Lemma 2-7\nthat G has a vertex v0 which is non-adjacent to v*; we note that then\nIf d{v) ^ A(G) - 1 (Vt> e V(G)), then it follows that A(G) - 1 < d(v0) ^ | V(G)\\ - 2, so\nj V(G)\\ ~ 1. Thus Case (i) of the lemma follows.\nSuppose from now that there is a vertex u e V(G) such that d(u) = A(6?) \u2014 x, for some\nx ^ 2. Let u be joined to v* by m* edges. As G is critical, u cannot be joined solely to\nv*, so let u also be joined to vertices wlt ...,wt, where t > 1. By Lemma 2-5,\nd*{wi) > A(G)-d(u) + l = x+l\nfor 1 ^ i < t. Therefore, for 1 ^ i ^ t,\nfa: \u2014 1 if wt${vvvj,\\\nif wte{vx,v^.\nStar multigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 309\nBy Lemma 2-5, again, d*(v) > 2 for all ve V(G) \\{v*}. But since d*(vt) > 2, d*(v2) =s 2\nand m(vv v2) < 1, it follows that d*(v*) ^ 2 also. Thus\nd*(v)>2 (VveF(G)).\nWhatever the value of \\{vv v2} n {wlt..., wt}\\, we have\nA(G) = d*(v) >m* + t(z-l) + 2.\nSince d(u) = A(G)-\u00a3 = m* + t, it follows that m* = A(G)-x-t, and so, after sub-\nstituting, we find that 2(t \u2014 1) ^ a;(\u00a3 \u2014 1). Therefore either t = 1 or x = 2.\nSuppose that f = 1. Consider the possibility that w1e{v1,v^. Then we may assume\nthat wx = \u00ab!. By Lemma 2-5, d*(wx) ^ x+l, and so it follows that m(\u00ab*, wx) ^ a;. Also\nby Lemma 2-5, d*(w2) ^ 2, and so m(v*,v2) ^ 1. Since d(\u00ab) = A((r) \u2014x, we have\nm(v*, u) = A(Cr) \u2014 x\u2014 1. Since there are exactly A((?) edges incident with v*, it follows\nthat m(v*, Wj) = x, m(v*, v2) = 1 and that v* is joined to no vertex other than u, wt\nand v2. Consequently m{vlt v2) = 1. Thus, within the subgraph induced by {v*, wl, v2, u},\nthere are x + 2 ^ 4 edges incident with w>x and 2 edges incident with i>2. But any further\nvertex satisfies d*(v) ^ 2, is not joined to v*, and so is joined to vt and v2. Therefore\nd(wx) > rf(w2) + 2, so e^ w )^ #= d(v2), a contradiction.\nNow suppose that t = 1 but M ^ I * ! , V 2 } - By Lemma 2-5, d*(Wj) ^ a;+1, d*(v) ^ 2\nand d*(\u00ab2) ^ 2, and so m(v*,w^) ^ a;\u20141, m(v*,vj ^ 1 and m(i>*,\u00bba) ^ 1. As above,\nm(v*,u) = A((?)-a;- 1. As there are exactly A(Cr) edges incident with \u00bb*, it follows\nthat \u00bb!(\u00ab*,\u00ab>!) = a:\u20141, ?\u00ab(\u00bb*,\u00ab!) = m(v*,v2) = 1, and that v* is joined to no other\nvertex. Consequently m(vx, v2) = 1. Since d*(v) ^ 2 for all\u00ab e F(Cr), it follows that any\nvertex peV\\{v*, u, vv v2} is joined to both vx and v2, and consequently\nA(G) = d(v1)=\\V(G)\\-2.\nBut by Lemma 2-5, d(p) > A((?) -d*(v1) + 1 = A((?)-l = |F(<?)| - 3 . Thus p is joined\nto all vertices except v* and u. Therefore\nTherefore x = 0. But x ^ 2, a contradiction. Thus < # 1.\nNow suppose that t ^ 2 and a; = 2. Then rf(\u00ab) = A(G) - 2. Suppose first that\n{vi> VH ^ {wi> \u2022\u2022\u2022> wt}- We may assume that w^  = vx and w2 = f2. Since\nit follows that m(\u00ab*,wt) > 1 (S^i^t), m(v*,Vi) ^ 2 and m(v*,v2)^2. Since\nm(\u00ab*,M) = A(G)-a;-\u00ab = A((?)-2-< and d(\u00ab*) = A(G), it follows that ^( t ;*,^) = 1\n(3 < i ^ \u00a3), that m(v*, vt) = m(z)*,\u00ab2) = 2 and that u* is joined to no other vertices.\nTherefore, as before, vx is joined to all vertices ve V(G) \\{v*,u, vu v2, w3,..., wt}. Since\nd*(Vj) = Sandm^*,^) = 2,itfollowsthatm(\u00ab1,\u00ab2) = l.Since,for3 ^ i < t,d*(wi) ^ 3\nand m(\u00ab*,wt) = 1, it follows that m^v^w^ = m(v2,wt) = 1 and d*(wt) = 3. Therefore\nA(G) = d(vx) = | F(G!)|. Now consider the vertex v0, which is non-adjacent to v*. Then\nvo${vltv2,v*,w3, ...,wt}. If v0 + M, then v0 is non-adjacent to both v* and u0, so\nd(v0) ^ |F(6r)| - 3 . However, as v0 is adjacent to vx and d*(vt) = 3, it follows from\nLemma 2-5 thatd(t;0) > A((?) - 2 = | V(G)\\ \u2014 2, a contradiction. Therefore v0 = u. Then\nm* = A(G)-2-t = 0, so t = A(G)-2 = \\ V(G)\\ -2, so v* is joined to every vertex\nexcept v0, and is joined to i^ and v2 by two edges, and to every other vertex by one\n310 A. G. CHETWYND AND A. J. W. HILTON\nedge. Since d(u) = | V(G)\\ \u2014 2, v0 = u is joined to every vertex except v*. For 3 < i < t,\nwt is adjacent to u, so by Lemma 2-5, d(wi) > A(G) \u2014 d*(u) + 1 = | V(G)\\ \u2014 1, so wt is\njoined to every vertex. Therefore G = K% for some m > 4.\nWe now show that m is not even. Suppose, to the contrary, that m = 2p. If p = 2\nthen JTJp is Class 2, but is not critical, a contradiction. Now suppose thatp ^ 3. Then\nwe obtain a contradiction by showing that K%p is Class 1. Let K2p be edge-coloured with\ncolours cv ...,c2p_1, and let v*, v0, vlt v2, v' be distinct vertices such that v*v0 and vxv'\nare both coloured c2p_1. Then recolour vxv' with c2pt remove the edge v*v0, insert an\nextra edge joining v* to vx coloured cSp_lt and an extra edge joining v* to v2 coloured c2p.\nThen K%p is edge-coloured with 2p colours, and so K%p is Class 1. Therefore G 4= K$p.\nTherefore G = K%n+1 for some n > 2, so G satisfies Case (ii) of this lemma.\nNow suppose that \\{vltv2} n {wv ...,wt}\\ = 1. We may suppose that vx \u2014 wx and\nthat v2 $ {wx wt}. We have m(v*, u) = A((?) \u2014 t \u2014 2 and, by Lemma 2-5,\nd*(wt) > 3 (1 < i ^ <).\nsomfi;*,^) ^ 2andw(t;*,wi) > 1 (2 ^ t < i). We also have d*(v%) ^ 2, so m(v*, v2) ^ 1.\nAs d(v*) = A((?), it follows that ra^*,^) = 2, m{v*, w{) = 1 (2 < i ^ <). m(\u00bb*,\u00bb2) = 1,\nm(wi> ^2) = li u* is joined to no other vertex, and that each vertex not in\n{v*,u,vt,v2,w2 wt}\nis joined to vx and v2. But then within the subgraph induced by {v*, u, vlt v2, w2,... ,wt},\nvx has t+ 3 edges on it and v2 has t+ 1 edges on it, so A((?) = d ^ ) =)= d(\u00ab2) = &(@)> a\ncontradiction. Therefore \\{vv v2] n 1^ , ...,wt}| #= 1.\nFinally, suppose that {v^v^ n {w!,..., wt} = 0 . As in earlier cases, it follows that\nm(v*,u) = A(G)-t-2, ?\u00bb(\u00bb*,\u00bb!) ^ 1, m(\u00ab*,v2)^l and m ^ * , ^ ) > 1 (1 < i < \u00ab)\u2022\nTherefore, as d(\u00ab*) = A((?), it follows that\nm(v*,u) = & ( G ) - t - 2 , m(v*,v1) = m(v*,v2)'=m(v*,wi)= 1 ( l ^ i ^ t ) ,\nm(Vn vi) = 1\u00bb w* is joined to no other vertices, and all vertices of\nV(G) \\{v*, u, vu v2, w^..., wt}\nare joined to vx and v2. Since m(vlt v*) = 1 and vt is joined to all vertices except u, we\nhave A(G) = d(vx) = \\ V(G)\\ - 2. By Lemma 2-5, it follows that if\nveV(G)\\{v1,v2,v*,v),\nthen d(v) = A(G) \u2014 1 = |F((?)| \u2014 3. If pe V(G)\\{v1,v2,v*,u,w1, ...,wt}, thenp is joined\nto all vertices except u and v*. As the vertices wv ...,wt are each joined to each vertex\nof V(G)\\{wly ...,\u00ab>t} by a single edge, wlt ...,wt induce a graph which is regular of\ndegree t \u2014 3. Therefore t ^ 3. We also have\nm{v*,u) = A(G)-t-2=\nSince G is not a simple graph, it follows that m(v*, u) ^ 2. Therefore | V(G)\\ ^ 9.\nSuppose first that | V(G)\\ is even, | V(G)\\ = 2n say. Let G' be a graph obtained from\nG by replacing all the edges between u and v* by a single edge. Let d[ ^ d'2 < ... < d2n\nbe the degrees of (?'. Then, as n ^ 5, we have\nd ; ^ 4 , rf2^6, d ^ 2 n - 3 , ...,d'2n_2> 2re-3, d2n_x = d2n = 2n - 2,\nStar multigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 311\nand the condition\nd'k ^ i + l = > ^ 2 n _ f c - i > 2 n \u2014 k ( l ^ k ^ n \u2014 1 )\nis satisfied, so, by Lemma 2-10, G' has a Hamiltonian circuit which includes the edge\nv\u00b1v%, and hence G has a 1-factor F including vvv2. Now G \\F has three vertices v*, vu v2\nof maximum degree A(G)-1 and d^^Vj) = d%^F{v2) = 1. By Lemma 2-8, if G\\F\nwere Class 2, then G \\F would contain a critical subgraph H with A(H) = A(G \\F). But\nby Lemma 2-5, vvv2$ V(H), and so H has just one vertex, namely v*, of maximum\ndegree. Since A(G) = |F(C?)| - 2 ^ 8 > 2, # contains no subgraph on three vertices\nwith A(H) + 1 edges [the only possibility for this would include v* as one of the three\nvertices, but the neighbours of v* are mutually non-adjacent]. Therefore,byLemma2-3,\nH is Class 1, a contradiction. Therefore | V(G)\\ is not even.\nNext suppose that | V(G)\\ is odd, | V(G)\\ = 2n + 1, say. Let G' be a graph obtained\nfrom G by replacing all the edges between u and v* by a single edge. Let G\" be obtained\nfrom G' by adjoining the further edge v2u. Let d\\ < d\"2 < ... < d\"2n_i be the degree\nsequence of G\". Then, as n ^ 4, we have\ndj ^ 5 , dj > 6, ^ ^ 2w-2, ...,<&,_! ^ 2 \u00ab - 2 , ( ^ = 2 \u00ab - 1, d^+1 = 2w,\nand G\" satisfies the condition\nTherefore, by Lemma 2-10, G\" has a Hamiltonian circuit which includes the path\nv1\u00ab2, v2u. Therefore G has a near 1-factor F which includes the edge v1v2 and does not\ncontain an edge incident with u. Then G \\F has three vertices v*, vv v2 of maximum\ndegree A(G) \u2014 1 and dov*1^) = dg^v^ = 1. We now obtain a contradiction as above.\n5. Proof of Theorems 1 and 2\nBy Lemma 3-3, Theorems 1 and 2 are equivalent. Formally we shall prove Theorem 2,\nbut we shall make use of this equivalence. To see that (2ii) => (2iii) we use Lemma 3*2.\nI t is easy to see that (2iii)=> (2ii) and that (2iii)=> (2i). What we have to prove is that\nLet G be a critical star multigraph with star centre v* with at most three vertices\nof maximum degree, including v*. For simple graphs, the truth of Theorem 2 follows\nfrom Lemma 2-9. Therefore we shall assume that G has at least one multiple edge. If\n| V(G)\\ = 3, then, since G is a star multigraph, \\E(G)\\ = A(G) + l. Suppose from now\non that |F(Cr)| > 3. Then G contains no subgraph on three vertices with A(Cr) + l\nedges, for otherwise G would not be critical. It therefore follows from Lemma 2-3 that\nTheorem 2 is true when G has at most two vertices of maximum degree. Therefore we\nshall also assume that G has three vertices of maximum degree, v*, vx and v2.\nI t follows from Lemma 4-1 that either G is K%n+1 for some n ^ 2, in which case G is\nclearly overfull, or G has three vertices of degree A(G) and the rest have degree A((?) \u2014 1,\nwhere A(G) s\u00a3 | V(G)\\ - 1. In this case, since \\E(G)\\ = \u00a3(| V(G)\\ (A{G)- 1)4-3), it\nfollows that | V(G)\\ is odd and A(G) is even. If A(G) = | V(G)\\ - 1 then G is just overfull,\nas required. We suppose from now that A(G) < | V(G)\\ - 2. Then, in fact, we have\n3. (2)\n312 A. G. CHETWYND AND A. J . W.

We asssume that Theorem 2 (and therefore, by\nLemma 3-3, Theorem 1 also) is true for lower values of | V(G)\\, or for the given value of\n| V(G)\\ and lower values of A(G).\nAs in Lemma 4-1\nd*(v)>2 (VeeF(G)).\nTherefore, as there are three vertices of maximum degree,\n3A(G) = S d*(v) * 2\\V(G)\\.\nLet the excess e(G) of G be defined by\ne(G) = 3A{G)- 2\\V(O)\\.\nThus e(G) measures the amount by which S\u00bb6F(O)^*(W) exceeds 2|F(6r)|.

Our first move is to show that\nthere is a near 1-factor F which does not include an edge which is incident with b,\nbut which does include the edge avv\nFrom G, form a graph G+ by inserting an edge ab. From G+ form a graph G' by\nreplacing each multiple edge on v* by a single edge. Let the vertices of G' be\nand have degrees d'x < d'2 < ... < d'2n+1. We may suppose that wx = v* except perhaps\nwhen there is only one multiple edge, between v* and, say, wlt where ^ ( ^ I ) = A((?) \u2014 1,\nand then we may take v* to be w2.\nIf d'(v*) s? 3 then, since d*(vx) > 2 and d*(v2) ^ 2, it follows that e{G) ^ A(G) - 6.\nFrom (4) it then follows that e(G) = A(G) - 6 and that\nd'(v*) = 3, mo(v*, Vl) = mo(v*, v2) = 2, mG(v*, w2) = A(G) - 4,\nand\nA(G)=\\V(G)\\-3.\nBut if v e V(G) \\{v*, w2, vlt v2}, then v is joined to vv so do(Vj) = | V(G)\\ \u2014 2, a contra-\ndiction.

By (3) and (8), it follows that the values of {k,n,\nwe must consider are (4, 5, 8), (3,4, 6) and (3,5,8). We consider these cases separately.\nFirst consider the case when (k, n, A(G)) = (4,5, 8). Then d[ ^ d'2 < d'z < d't < 6 and\nw1 = v*. Bearing in mind that mG(v*,v^ 5= 1 and mG{v*, v2) > 1, the only possibilities\nare either that (a) d'(v*) = 5 and v* has on it two edges of multiplicity 1 and three edges\nof multiplicity 2, or that (b) d'(v*) = 4 and there is one edge of multiplicity 1, two edges\nof multiplicity 2 and one edge of multiplicity 3 on v*, or that (c) d'(v*) = 3 and there\nis one edge of multiplicity 2 and two edges of multiplicity 3 on v*. In case (a), we have\nd'x = 5, d'2 = d3 = d't = 6, d'5 = 7, and so G+ satisfies the Chvatal-Berge condition (7).\nIn case (6), we have d[ = 4, d2 = d'3 = d't \u2014 6, d'5 = 1 and again (7) is satisfied. Finally,\ncase (c) does not in fact arise, because e(G) = 3A((r) \u20142| V(G)\\ = 2, so that d*(v) = 2\nfor all except at most two vertices v.\nNext consider the case when (k, n, A((?)) = (3,5, 8). Then d'x < d'% < d'3 < 5 and\nw^ = \u00ab*. Bearing in mind that mo(v*, vx) > 1 and ma(v*,v2) > 1, and that, by (6),\nd'(v*) ^ 4, the only possibility is that d{v*) = 4 and v* has two edges of multiplicity 1\nand two edges of multiplicity 3 on it. Let dx < ... ^ d\"w be the degrees of G' \\^ox\\\nSince, as above, d*(v) = 2 for all except at most two vertices v, w2 and w3 cannot be\njoined to either vr or v%. Therefore d\\ = 3, d\\ = 5, $J = 5 and d\\ = 6. Therefore the\ncondition\nd\"k s\nis satisfied with n = 5, and so, by Lemma 2-10, t r ' ^v j has a Hamiltonian circuit\ncontaining the edge ah. Therefore C \\{\u00bbj} has a 1 -factor containing ab. But a is adjacent\nto vx in G+, so (?+ (and therefore G) has a near 1-factor F containing the edge avx and\navoiding the vertex b.\nLastly consider the case when (k, n, A((?)) = (3,4, 6). In this case we obtain a contra-\ndiction by arguing directly that G is Class 1. Since e(G) = 3&(G)-2\\V(G)\\ = 0 and\nd*(v) $5 2 (Vt)G V(G)), it follows that do(v*) = 2 (Vve V(G)). Therefore there is exactly\none edge between any two of v*, vv v2, there are no edges of multiplicity greater than 2\nand any vertex joined to v* by a double edge is not joined to v1 or v2. Either (a) v* has\nfour edges of multiplicity 1 and one edge of multiplicity 2, or (b) v* has two edges of\nmultiplicity 1 and two edges of multiplicity 2. In case (a) G\\v* has degrees 3, 4, 4,\n5, 5, 5, 5, 5. By Lemma 2-10, G\\v* has a Hamiltonian circuit containing the edge\nvxv2. Consequently G has a near 1-factor F' containing one edge from the double edge\non v* and the edge vxv2. But G \\F' is a simple graph of order 9 and maximum degree 5\nand is not overfull. Therefore, by Lemma 2-1, G\\F (and therefore G) is Class 1, a\ncontradiction. In case (b), G\\v* has degree sequence (3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5). Let v7 and v8\nbe the vertices joined to v* by a double edge. By Lemma 2-10, G \\v* has a Hamiltonian\ncircuit. Therefore G has a 1-factor Fx containing one of the edges joining v* to vB, an\nedge incident with v1 and an edge incident with v2- Then G \\FX has four vertices v*, vu v2,\nand, say, w, of degree 5, and the remaining vertices have degree 4. If w = v7, then the\ndegree sequence of (G \\Fj) \\v* is (3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4). By Lemma 2-10, this has a\nHamiltonian circuit, and so G has a near 1-factor F2 containing an edge joining v*\nto v7, an edge incident with vlt and an edge incident with v2. Thus G\\(FX u F2) is a\nsimple graph of order 9 and maximum degree 4, and is not overfull. Therefore, by\nLemma 2-1, G\\{FX u F2) is Class 1. Therefore G is Class 1, a contradiction. If w # v7,\nthen the degree sequence of (G \\FX) \\v* is (2, 3, 4,4, 4,4, 4, 5). The argument is the same,\nStar multigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 315\nexcept that F2 must include an edge incident with w as well, and also leads to a contra-\ndiction. In view of (2) and (3), we may assume from now that | V(G)\\ > 11 and\nAt this point we have shown that either d'j. ^ k + 3 (3 ^ k 4: n \u2014 1), or G contains a\nnear 1-factor F which includes the edge avx and avoids b, or G is Class 1 (a contra-\ndiction).\nNow suppose that either d'x ^ 3 or d'2 < 4. Then, by (6), d'(v*) = 4. If d[ < 3, then\nv* = w2 and mG(w1> w2) = A(G) \u2014 3, contradicting (5). Therefore d[ = 4, so v* = wi and\nd'(w2) = 4. If w2 e {vlt v2} then mo(v*, w2) = A(G) \u2014 3, again contradicting (5). Therefore\nM>2 ${vl7 v2) and mo(v*, w2) = A(G) \u2014 4. Therefore, by (5),\ne((?) = A(G)-6 and A{G) = \\V(G)\\ - 3 ,\nand so d*(v) = 2 for v${w2,v*). Therefore ma(v*,v^) = mo(v*,v2) - mo{v1,v2) = 1 and\nmo(v*,y) = 2.\nLet the degrees of G' \\{w1} be d\\ < ... sg d^- Then dj = 3, d2 = 4,\n\u00ab? = . . . = d2\"n-3 = A((?) - 2 and d2\"n_2 = d\"2n_^ = 4'ra\nTherefore the condition\nis satisfied, and so, by Lemma 2-10, (?' \\{ux} has a Hamiltonian circuit containing the\nedge ah. Therefore G' \\{\u00ab1} has a 1-factor containing ah. But a is adjacent in G+ to vv\nso G+ (and therefore G) has a near 1-factor F containing the edge ai^ and avoiding the\nvertex b.\nIf G' satisfies (7) then G contains a near 1-factor F including av^ and avoiding b.\nThus in all cases it follows that either G is Class 1 (a contradiction) or G contains a near\n1-factor F including av1 and avoiding b. So from now on we shall assume G contains F.\nThe graph G \\F has four vertices, v*, vlt v2, b, of maximum degree A(Gf) \u2014 1, but the\nvertex a is adjacent to only one of them (v2). Therefore, by Lemma 2-6, G\\F and\nG\u00b0 = (G\\F) \\{a}]havethe same chromatic class. The graph G0 has three vertices, v*, vlt b,\nof maximum degree, and has 2n vertices.\nIf G\u00b0 contains a subgraph H on three vertices with A(G!0) 4-1 edges, then, since G\u00b0\nis a star-multigraph, v* must be one of the vertices. Then do\u00bb(v*) = A(G\u00b0) \u2014 A{G)~ 1,\nso d'(v*) < 3. But this contradicts (6). Therefore G\u00b0 contains no such subgraph.\nSince | V(G)\\ > A((?) + 3 it follows that | V(G\u00b0)\\ > A(G\u00b0) + 3, and so by induction we\nobtain the contradiction that G\u00b0 (and therefore G) is Class 1, unless A(G\u00b0) = 2m + 1 for\nsome integer m, G\u00b0 contains a bridge e, and G\u00b0 \\e = (?J U G\\, where G\\ n G\\ \u2014 0,\nA(fl?) = 2m+1, and G\\ = K%n+1 (for m ^ 2) or G\\ = Klm+1.\nThe number of edges of E{G) \\E(G\u00b0) which are incident with vertices of G\\ is at\nmost 2m + 1. The vertex v* is incident in G with at most one vertex of F(G\u00a7) U {a}, so at\nleast one of vlt v2, say vlt is in V(G\\). But then vx is incident in G with at most two ver-\ntices in V(G%) u {a}. However, since d*(v) > 2 (Vve V(G)), any vertex in V(G%) U {a} is\nincident with v* or vx\\ consequently | V(G\\) U {a}\\ < 3. Since all multiple edges of G\nare incident with v*, not more than one edge of F is incident with two vertices of Gv\nand yet each vertex of G\\, except for possibly one, is incident with an edge of F.\n316 A. G. CHETWYND AND A. J . W. HILTON\nTherefore |F((?g) U {a}| > |F(<?})|-3 = 2m-2 . Therefore 3 > 2m-2 , so m < 2, so\nA(G\u00b0) ^ 5, and so A(G) < 6. By (3), therefore, 6 ^ \u00a7|F(\u00a3)|, so 9 ^ \\V(G)\\. However,\nthis contradicts the assumption we are now making that | V(G)\\ > 11.\nThus there is no critical star multigraph H with three vertices including v* of\nmaximum degree satisfying (2). This proves Theorems 1 and 2.\n6. Proofs of Theorems 3 and 4\nTheorem 3 is an easy consequence of Theorem 1, and Theorem 4 follows from\nTheorem 3.\nProof of Theorem 3. The cases when s = 1 or 2 were proved in [3]. Now consider the\ncase when s = 3. If n = 1 or 2, then Theorem 3 is easily seen to be true in this case.\nSo suppose that n > 3. Let v* be the star centre and let to be a vertex which is non-\nadjacent to v*. Then G\\w has 2n + l vertices, three vertices of maximum degree,\nincluding v*, and no induced subgraph on three vertices with more than\nedges. Furthermore G\\w is connected. Therefore G\\w satisfies the hypotheses of\nTheorem 1. The minimum degree of G\\w is 2n \u2014 3 = 2n \u2014 s > n. Therefore G\\w does\nnot contain a bridge, so G \\w does not satisfy Case (1 iii) of Theorem 1. Clearly it does\nnot satisfy Cases (li) or (Iii) either. Therefore G\\w is Class 1. Since\n\\E(G\\w)\\ = i((2n + 2)(2n-2))-(2n-2)\n= (2n-2)n\nin any edge-colouring of G \\w with A(6?) = A(G \\w) colours, each colour is missing from\nexactly one vertex. Therefore any such edge-colouring can be extended to an edge-\ncolouring of G by giving each edge incident with w the colour missing at the corre-\nsponding vertex of G\\w. Therefore G is Class 1. This proves Theorem 3.\nProof of Theorem 4. The sufficiency is trivial, and we need to prove the necessity.\nLet G be a simple graph with\n\\V(G)\\=2n+l, A(G) = 2n-2 and \\E(G)\\ = A(G)\nSuppose also that G does not contain any overfull subgraph with maximum degree\n2n \u2014 2 (any such subgraph would have 2n\u2014l vertices).\nAdjoin a further vertex v* and 2n-2 further edges so as to create a regular star-\nmultigraph G* of degrees 2n \u2014 2 with In+ 2 vertices. Since\n-\n2 ) = i(2\u00bb + 2)(2n-2),\nthis can be done. If we show that G* contains no subgraph on three vertices with 2n \u2014 1\nedges, then it follows from Theorem 3 that G* is Class 1, and therefore G is Class 1, as\nrequired.\nSuppose otherwise, namely that G* does have a subgraph on three vertices with 2n\u2014l\nStar midtigraphs with three vertices of maximum degree 317\nedges. One of the three vertices must be v*; let the other two be denoted by w1 and w2.\nThen each of the 2n \u2014 2 edges on v* would have to be joined to wt or w2, and wt and w%\nwould have to be joined by one edge. Therefore wx and w2 would be joined in G* by a\ntotal of 2(2\u00bb - 2) - (2n - 2) - 2 = In - 4 edges to vertices of V(G*) \\{v*, wx, w2}. Since\nG* is regular of degree 2n \u2014 2, it follows that G* \\{v*, wt, w2} contains\n\u00a3 { ( 2 T O - 1 ) ( 2 \u00bb - 2 ) - ( 2 \u00bb - 4 ) } = ( 2 \u00bb - 2 ) ( \u00bb - l ) + l\nedges, and so G* \\{v*, wv w2} is overfull, a contradiction.\nTherefore G is Class 1, and Theorem 4 is proved.\nThe authors started to write this paper (and a number of others to follow) whilst\nthey attended a workshop on latin squares at Simon Fraser University, organised by\nDr K.
