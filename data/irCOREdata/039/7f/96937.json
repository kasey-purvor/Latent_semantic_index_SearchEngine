BIOL~CICALMOTIVATIONANDTHEIMPORTANCE \nOFPATTERNFORMATION \nThe generation of biological pattern and form are key issues in the early \ndevelopment of an embryo. Embryonic cells divide, migrate, and differentiate \nto form the various organs in the body. Many of these structures have a \nregular pattern, such as feather and scale patterns, while others have distinctive \nquasi-regular patterns such as the stripes on alligators and the spots on leopards. \nThese markings are usually formed early in development. For example, in \nthe case of the stripes on a zebra the pattern is probably laid down by the \nfourth week; this compares with a 365day gestation period. Modeling of \nbiological pattern and form is discussed in detail in the book by Murray [ 11. \nThe specific model discussed here was proposed in [ 21 and various biological \napplications are presented in [ 3 1. \nPigment patterns are generated by cells which make melanin; these cells \nlie in the skin layers made up of the epidermis and the dermis. Cell migration \nand cell differentiation are two basic processes involved in the generation of \npigmentation patterns of the vertebrate integument. Several models have been \nproposed for skin patterning. For example, reaction-diffusion models [ 4-7, \n1 ] hypothesize the existence of chemicals (morphogens) which react and diffuse \nand, under appropriate conditions, generate spatially heterogeneous patterns. \nCells are then assumed to be preprogrammed to differentiate according to the \nlevel of the chemical they experience. Much of the justification for such models \nis still circumstantial. The Oster-Murray mechanochemical theory (for a re- \nview see [ 8, I] ) of biological pattern formation can also generate patterns \nsimilar to those created by reaction-diffusion models and their solutions ex- \nhibit similar developmental geometric constraints first described in the context \nof skin patterns by Murray [ 61. The concept of developmental constraints \nare discussed in detail in [ 21. In the model we discuss here the patterns are \nin cell density and the development of the patterns involves movement of \nactual biological cells which we believe to be the precursors of melanophores. \nThe model proposed by Oster and Murray [ 21 takes account of cell motility \nand chemotaxis, the chemical processes by which ceils migrate up a chemical \ngradient. In their model the cells both respond to and produce the chemoat- \ntractant. This model was recently proposed for the stripe and shadow patterns \non the alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) [ 9, IO]. Experimental results un- \nequivocably show that scale is crucial in determining the number of stripes \non alligators, and that higher densities of melanin-forming cells are found in \nthe dark stripe regions of the alligator. \nIn Section 2 we briefly describe the chemotaxis model, while in Section 3 \nwe describe in detail the numerical methods involved in using ENTWIFE to \nanalyze the differential equation system. In Section 4 we present a selection \nof spatially patterned solutions and discuss the complex bifurcation picture \nBIOLOGICAL PATTERN GENERATOR 357 \nthat was found. We also describe the effect on the patterns of domain growth \nsince in many developmental situations spatial organization of pattern takes \nplace on a time scale commensurate with significant growth of the em- \nbryo [lo]. \n2. CELL-CHEMOTAXISMODELEQUATIONS \nChemotaxis is a major factor in many developmental situations and this \nis the key aggregation force in our model. The model, discussed in detail in \n[ 2, 31, involves two dependent variables, the cell density, n( r, t), and the \nchemoattractant concentration, c( r, t), where r and t are the spatial coordinate \nand time, respectively. The model consists of a pair of coupled nonlinear \npartial differential equations which describes the motion of the cells and the \nproduction, diffusion, and degradation of the chemoattractant. \nThe equation for cell density is \nan \n- = D,,V\u2019n - &.(nVc) + rn(N- n), at \ndiffision chemotaxis cell growth \n(2.1) \nwhere we have assumed that cell division may be described by a simple logistic \ngrowth where rN is the linear mitotic growth rate. The chemotaxis term reflects \nthe fact that cells move up a concentration gradient in c; the chemotaxis \nparameter is IX We also assume that the cells diffuse with diffusion coefficient \nD,. The parameters r, N, cy, and D, are all positive constants. \nThe cells are assumed to secrete their own chemoattractant in a Michaelis- \nMenten fashion. The chemoattractant diffuses with diffusion coefficient D, \nand degrades according to first-order kinetics. The equation for the chemotactic \nconcentration c then takes the form \nYC, (2.2) \ndiffusion production degradation \nwhere S, & y, and D, are all positive constants. \nWe are interested in pattern formation on finite two-dimensional domains- \nthe model for the skin of developing vertebrates-so we consider these equa- \ntions on a finite domain D with zero flux boundary conditions, namely \nn.Vc(r) = n-On(r) = 0 for rEdD, (2.3) \n3.58 WINTERS ET AL.. \nwhere n is the unit outward normal to the boundary aD. The mathemattcal \nproblem consists of Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2)) with boundary conditions (2.3 ). \nTo solve the equations numerically we cast the system in nondimensional \nterms by writing \nY 1 1 l\/2 r*= - r D,s \u2019 p 2 s \u2019 n* = n f4 -\u201clc- p\u2019 -s\u2019 \nas (ye = - rP \nYD~ \u2019 \nr* = - (2.4) \nY \nwhere s is a scale factor. We could of course absorb s into a new scaling for \nt and r but we retain it here since we can think of s = 1 as the unit domain \nand carry out the computation on a fixed domain size and increase s to \nsimulate larger domains, a procedure used in the simulation of reaction- \ndiffusion systems [ 4-61. With (2.4) the nondimensional equations become. \non omitting the asterisks for notational simplicity, \nan \n- = DV2n - aV-(SC) + sm(N- n) \nat \n(2.5a) \n%-v2c+s npc \nat [ 1 1+n \nn-Vc(r) = n-Vn(r) = 0, rEdD, (2.k) \nwhere aD is now the boundary of the scaled domain. To be specific we consider \nthe domain D to be rectangular with width Lx and length L,; we use Cartesian \ncoordinates (x, y) . \nThe system (2.5) has two uniform steady states, n = 0, c = 0 and n = N, \nc = N\/( 1 + N), and a linear analysis about these uniform states shows that \nthe trivial steady state is always unstable but that the nontrivial spatially ho- \nmogeneous solution can be driven unstable in certain parameter regimes by \nspatially heterogeneous perturbations and evolve to inhomogeneous spatial \npatterns in n and c. The form of the pattern is determined primarily by the \nnondimensional parameter set (D, (Y, r, N) and the size and shape of the \ndomain. The linearized system has solutions of the form cos(m7rx\/L,) \nX cos( Z*y\/L,) for integers m and 1. A pattern of lateral stripes, for example, \nis given by the (0, I) mode where the higher the value of 1 the more stripes \nwe have on the domain. In order to select a mode (m, I) on a rectangular \ndomain we require (see Appendix for details) \nBIOLOGICAL PATJ-ERN GENERATOR 359 \n-=1r4E2+L rNs2 \n2 2 \nD i I Lf L$ \nNa \u2019 \nrN+D-(l +N)2 =&DN. 1 \n(2.6a) \nThus, our linear analysis predicts that the uniform steady state will evolve to \na spatially nonuniform steady state in the appropriate parameter space, the \nform of the final pattern depending on the parameters. We now proceed to \nanalyze the full nonlinear system for possible steady states. \n3. NUMERICAL DETAILS \n3.1. Finite-Element Equations \nThe equations (2.5a) and (2.5b) are discretized in the finite-element ap- \nproximation using a standard Galerkin formulation with the second-order \nterms integrated by parts. This leads to the following form: \ns Vfn-[DV, - anVc]dV- s fn[ DVn - anVc] * dS D dD \nsrn(N - n) - $]dV = 0 (3.1) \ns \nVf,.VcdV- \nD \n~D~Vc.dS-s,+(&-c)-$]dV=O. (3.2) \nIn these equations, D is the spatial region being discretized, aD is the boundary \nof D, dS is the vector area with direction out of the domain, fn is a test \nfunction for the variable n, and f, is a test function for the variable c. \nThe integration by parts gives a boundary integral for each equation over \ndD. The integrand consists of a normal flux and the boundary integral con- \ntributes only when this flux is nonzero. For the present boundary conditions \n(2.5~) all boundary integrals are zero. \nIn our finite-element approximation of this weak formulation of the full \nsystem we expand the cell density and chemoattractant in quadratic functions \nbased on nine-noded quadrilateral elements. A Galerkin formulation is \nadopted in which the test functionsf, andf, are chosen from the same set of \nquadratic basis functions. The resulting integrals of products of quadratic \nfunctions are evaluated numerically by Gauss quadrature. The nonlinear al- \ngebraic equations for the unknown nodal values of the cell density and che- \nmoattractant are linearized using a Newton-Raphson procedure, and the so- \n360 WINTERS ET AL. \nlution of the linear set of equations at each iteration is obtained using a direct. \nfrontal solver. \n3.2. Bifurcation Algorithms \nWe write the set of nonlinear algebraic equations which result from the \nfinite-element discretization of (2.5 ) as \nM$+ f(x,h,p)=O (x E Xl, (3.3) \nwhere f is a smooth nonlinear function, M is a linear operator on R\u201d where \nn is the number of degrees of freedom in the discretization, X is a bifurcation \nparameter, and p is a vector of control parameters. We distinguish the bifur- \ncation parameter X from the control parameters p because we seek the change \nof behavior as this particular parameter is varied. \nIn the present problem we are concerned only with steady-state solutions \nof (3.3), that is, solutions x which satisfy \nf(x, A, PI = 0, (3.4) \nand we wish to locate the critical values of h at which bifurcations in the \nsolutions occur. Here, the bifurcation parameter is the chemotactic coefficient \nCY in (2.5) and the control parameters are r, D, N, and the scale parameter \nS. Our first objective will be to locate these bifurcations for fixed values of \nthe control parameters. Having located a singular point we then obtain the \nvariation of the solution with the critical bifurcation parameter CY with the \ncontrol parameters fixed. We may also fix (Y and vary the control parameters. \nIn this way a path of bifurcation points is traced out, and this path may itself \nhave a singular point that we wish to locate. \nTo understand how we are able to obtain information on possible bifur- \ncations and instabilities from the steady-state equations, we consider the linear \nstability of a steady solution ~0 of Eq. (3.4) with respect to a small perturbation \nxl. The behavior of the perturbation xl is governed to lowest order by the \nlinear equation \nM 2 + f,(xrj, A, p)x, = 0. (3.5) \nNow let d be a generalized eigenvector of fx( ~0, A, p) with eigenvalue c such \nthat \nf,5? = aM%. (3.6) \nBIOLOGICAL PATTERN GENERATOR 361 \nThen if the perturbation x1 is along X it behaves as \nxl(t) = t exp[-at]X, (3.7) \nwhere t is the component of xl along % at t = 0. The steady solution r~, is \nlinearly stable if all the generalized eigenvalues u have Re( a) > 0; all small \nperturbations will decay until the steady state is restored. We note that since \nf, is real the eigenvalues in (3.6) are either real or else occur in complex \nconjugate pairs. \nAs the bifurcation parameter X varies, the linear stability of the steady \nsolution x,, changes when one or more of the eigenvalues in ( 3.6) crosses the \nimaginary axis. Thus there is a critical value of X for which u = 0 and f, is \nsingular; this critical value is called a singular or bifurcation point of Eq. \n(3.4). We know from the Implicit Function Theorem that the uniqueness of \nthe steady solution ~0 cannot be guaranteed when the Jacobian f, becomes \nsingular and this usually (but not necessarily) marks the appearance of multiple \nsteady-state solutions. \nWe note that if a generalized eigenvalue becomes purely imaginary, that \nis, u = &io, then Eq. (3.4) has a Hopf bifurcation which gives rise to periodic \nsolutions of angular frequency w at a critical value of X, although the Jacobian \nf, is not actually singular at that point. We do not address the existence of \nHopf bifurcations in the present paper. \n3.2.1. Stability of Solution Branches. From the above discussion it might \nappear that the stability of solution branches can be deduced only from a \ncomputation of the full eigenvalue spectrum of f,. Fortunately, limited in- \nformation on stability can be inferred from the Jacobian determinant: since \nthis is the product of the eigenvalues then its sign must equal ( - 1 )q, where \nq is the number of negative, unstable eigenvalues. Thus, a negative sign in- \ndicates that the branch is unstable since there is at least one negative eigenvalue, \nbut a positive sign does not imply stability since there might be an even \nnumber of unstable eigenvalues. \nThe sign of the Jacobian determinant is also useful for detecting bifurcation \npoints along a solution branch while varying the bifurcation parameter X, \nsince the sign will in general change when a singular point is passed. \n3.2.2. Extended Systems. The general procedure we adopt for locating \nbifurcation points of Eq. (3.4) is to solve the equation simultaneously with \nconditions satisfied at the bifurcation. One condition which must always hold, \nby definition, is that the Jacobian matrix is singular so that it has at least one \nzero eigenvalue. Additional conditions may hold depending on the type of \nbifurcation which is to be located and these conditions can be derived from \nsingularity theory [ 111. The resulting extended system of equations are solved \nby Newton\u2019s method to give both the solution at the bifurcation point and \n362 WINTERS ET AI \nthe value of the bifurcation parameter. This approach is described in detail \nin [12]. \nThe different types of singular points with which we are concerned in the \npresent problem are: \nprimary bifurcations from a trivial solution (that is, one which does not \ndepend on the bifurcation parameter); \nsimple turning points on nonlinear solution branches. \nIn addition, we detected the presence of secondary bifurcations from the non- \nlinear branches that originate at the primary bifurcations from the trivial \nsolution, but we did not attempt to locate their positions exactly or to step \nonto the secondary bifurcating branches. \nIn the present problem the spatial patterns correspond to nonlinear branches \nthat bifurcate from the uniform trivial solution. We define a trivial solution \nof Eq. (3.4) to be a solution which is independent of X and denote it ~0. We \nlocate bifurcations from ~0 by computing the eigenvectors [ of the Jacobian \nmatrix fX( xr,, A, p) which have a simple zero eigenvalue; that is, we solve \nuxo, A, PIE = 0 \nI(,$) - 1 = 0, (3.8) \nwhere the last equation defines a normalization for the right eigenvector [. \nThe branch of solutions bifurcating away from the singular point (~0, A, \np) may be approximated by \nx = x0 + c&J + * * - ) (3.9) \nx = x0 + 1\/2t% + * - -, (3.10) \nwhere 6 is defined by a complex expression given by [ 13 1. \nThe above expressions reflect the fact that the primary bifurcations are \npitchfork in shape. They will be either sub- or supercritical according to \nwhether 6 is negative or positive. In order to compute the solution on any \nnonlinear branch which bifurcates from the trivial solution we use Eqs. ( 3.9) \nand (3.10) to construct an initial guess at the new value of A; Newton\u2019s method \nwill then converge quadratically to the solution on the branch for sufficiently \nsmall (A - A,). The branch is then followed for varying X by standard con- \ntinuation techniques (see Section 3.2.3 ). \nTo locate limit points (also called turning points or one-sided bifurcation \npoints) we use the extended system proposed by [ 141; \nBIOLOGICAL PATTERN GENERATOR 363 \nf(x, A, P) = 0 \nfx(x, A, P)E = 0 \nl(5) - 1 = 0, (3.11) \nwhere the last equation in (3.11) is a normalization condition, as in (3.8 ). \n3.2.3. Continuation. Euler-Newton continuation is an effective means of \nfollowing a particular solution branch. In its simplest form the solution ~0 \nobtained at X = X0 and its derivative &\/ah are used to predict the solution \nx1 at a new value X1, from \n(a) (b) (cd \nl \nincreasing cell den&y \nI%. 1.

Bifurcation to (0, 2) \nmode at (I = 12.01. (b) D = 0.25, r = 24.35, N = 1, s = 1. Bifurcation to (1, 0) mode at 01 \n= 118.54. In this case mode (0, 4) is also a solution. To separate these degenerate modes we \nsolved the system on a 1 X 4.1 domain. (c) D = 0.25, r = 1.52, N = 1, s = I. Bifurcation to ( 1, \n4) mode at a = 27.06.

(3.12) \nThe Newton-Raphson iterations converge rapidly at each value of Aj, for a \nsuitable step size ( Aj - Xj-r ), but this procedure ultimately fails at a limit \npoint in the solution curve, where the Jacobian matrix is singular. \nIn practice, we used a better method which introduces a pseudo-arclength \nparameter, s (not to be confused with the scale parameter in Section 2)) to \nparametrize the solution [ 15 1. For continuation in X = X(s) we solve the \nextended system \nfk A, PI = 0, N(x, A, s) = 0, (3.13) \nwhere \nN = [ 1 $ (s,,) 7\u2018 [x(s) - x(so)] + 2 (so) [X(s) - A(so)I - (s - so).

DISCUSSION \nIn this paper we have illustrated the application of the finite-element package \nENTWIFE to the study of the steady-state bifurcation behavior of a cell- \nchemotactic model for biological pattern generation. This simple model ex- \nhibits a surprisingly complex and diverse range of patterns. In this paper we \nhave presented a selection of steady-state spatial patterns.

However, ENTWIFE can calculate the structure of the \nsteady state and its nonlinear behavior as parameters change along the bifur- \ncation branch. It also enabled us to study the effects on the pattern of changes \nin scale and geometry. The analysis of the effects of changes in such geometrical \nparameters is very important in biology. \nHere we have illustrated only some of the features of ENTWIFE. Further \ncapabilities and a description of applications in the field of fluid mechanics \nare given in [16]. \nIn the simulations presented, the stability of the patterns was not investi- \ngated. Thus some of the patterns may be unstable. However, in view of the \nfact that observed developmental patterns may be in response to transient \nunderlying patterns, unstable patterns are still relevant. A detailed eigenvalue \nanalysis along every solution branch would be necessary to prove stability of \neach pattern and to discount possible Hopf bifurcations to time-periodic pat- \ntern. Such a detailed study is possible with the techniques available in ENT- \nWIFE but is outside the scope of the present work. \nAPPENDIX \nEquations (2.5) exhibit two uniform steady states for (n, c) given by (0, \n0) and (N, N\/( 1 + N) . Here we carry out linear stability analysis for the \nnonzero steady state (N, N\/( 1 + N)). (By inspection the steady state (0, 0) \nis always unstable.) \nWe linearize (2.5) in the usual way by substituting n = N + u, c = N\/( 1 \n+ N) + u, where ( u 1, ] D ] are small, and retaining only linear terms. This \ngives the linear system, which governs behavior near the steady state, as \nau - = DV2u - CYNV~V - rNsu at \ndu = v3) + s \nat (1 +uN)2 - \u2019 1 (Alb) \nn-Vu(x) = n+Vv(x) = 0, XEaD. (Alc) \nWe look for solutions to (A 1) of the form \nexp[ik. x + At], \nwhere X = X(k) determines the temporal growth rate of the periodic spatial \ndisturbance with wave vector k. The condition for nontrivial solutions for Q, \nand u. to exist is given by \n370 WINTERS ET AL. \nx*+[(D+ l)k\u2019+rN+s]X \n+[Dk4+{rNs+Ds- (L\u2019Na) }k2 + rNs2] = 0 (A2 ) \n(1 + N)* \nand the wave with wavenumber ] k 1 must satisfy the boundary conditions \n(Ale). Equation (A2) is the dispersion relation and determines the linear \nstability of the uniform steady state to disturbances of wave vector k. If X( k2) \n< 0 then the disturbance of wave vector k will decay with time. If X( k*) > 0 \nfor some k2 then the disturbance with these wavenumbers will grow and the \nsystem will evolve to a nonuniform spatially structured solution. \nOn a rectangular domain with zero flux boundary conditions the eigen- \nfunctions of the linear system are cos( m~x\/L,)cos(hy\/L,,), where m and 1 \nare integers. Thus the appropriate wave vector k has the form (k,, k,), where \nk, = (m?r\/ Lx), kY = (1~1 L,), and the values of k* which produce a pattern \nare those where X( k*) > 0, where \nk.k=k*zK* (A3) \nAt the onset of instability to disturbance with wave vector k,, X( kz) = 0; \nthat is, kc satisfies \nSNCY \n(1 +N)* I \nk2 + rNs* = 0. (A4) \nIf we wish to isolate only one unstable wave vector, we require (A4) to \nhave only one solution for k*. Forcing (A4) to have equal roots results in the \ncondition \nsNa \u2019 \nrNs + Ds - ( 1 + N)2 \nI \n- 4DrNs\u2019 = 0. (A5) \nFrom (A4) and (A5 ) we can deduce that the modulus of the critical wave \nvector is given by \n(Ah) \nBy choosing D, s, r, and N appropriately, we can find a k2 from (A3 ) which \nalso satisfies (A6), and then solve (A5 ) for (Y (we take the larger root for cr, \nso that kz is positive). This determines the point in (N, D, r, S, cy) parameter \nspace where mode (A6 ) is isolated. \nBIOLOGICAL PATTERN GENERATOR 371 \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work (J.D.M.) was supported in part by Grant DMS-9003339 from the U.S. National \nScience Foundation, and (K.H.W.) by the Underlying Program of the U.K.A.E.A.
