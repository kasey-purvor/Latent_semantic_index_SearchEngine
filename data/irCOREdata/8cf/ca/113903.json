Circadian rhythms play an important role in adipose \nphysiology, with plasma adipokine concentration and ~20% of the murine adipose \ntranscriptome undergoing24 h variation.  However, due to the heterogeneity of adipose tissue \nand rhythmical input from both neuronal and humoral signals, the cellular basis of adipose \nrhythms is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that adipocyte cells contain a circadian clock \nthat drives rhythmic mRNA expression and adipokine secretion.   From the murine pre-\nadipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line, we generated populations of both pre-adipocytes and \ndifferentiated adipocytes.  Cells were then treated with a 2 h serum pulse and sampled every 4 \nh over a 48 h  period.  Expression of clock gene, \u2018metabolic\u2019 gene (PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1) \nand adipokine mRNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, and secretion of the \nadipokines leptin and adiponectin was measured in culture medium from differentiated \nadipocytes. In pre-adipocytes, we observed robust rhythms of clock genes Per2, Rev-erb\u03b1, \nand Dbp, but not of Per1, Cry1, Bmal1, or any of the \u2018metabolic\u2019 genes.  Adipocytes \nproduced similar temporal profiles of mRNA expression, albeit with a markedly reduced \namplitude of Per2 and Dbp rhythms.  Despite no circadian rhythm of adipokine mRNA \nexpression, leptin accumulation in the culture medium suggested circadian control of leptin \nsecretion from adipocytes.  Adiponectin secretion showed temporal variation, but without any \napparent circadian rhythmicity. Our data, therefore, suggest that an endogenous adipocyte \nclock controls the rhythmic expression of only a subset of genes that are reported to exhibit 24 \nh rhythmicity in murine adipose tissue.  Moreover, secretion of leptin may also be regulated \nby the adipocyte clock.

Moreover, many aspects of metabolic physiology are under circadian \ncontrol (Bray & Young, 2007; Hastings et al., 2007; Zvonic et al., 2007; Green et al., 2008).  \nAnalysis of transgenic mouse models has recently provided compelling molecular links \nbetween components of the circadian clock and metabolism.  Although the resulting \nphenotype appears partially dependent on genetic background, mutation of clock-related \ngenes results in metabolic dysregulation (Turek et al., 2005; Oishi et al., 2006; Green et al., \n2007; Kennaway et al., 2007).  Similar genetic links have been found in humans, with clock \ngene polymorphisms being associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes \nmellitus and circadian rhythm sleep disorders (Woon et al., 2007; Monteleone et al., 2008; \nScott et al., 2008; Sookoian et al., 2008; Pereira et al. 2005; Lee et al., 2007; Pedrazzoli et al., \n2007). \n \nWhite adipose tissue (WAT) is a key metabolic structure.  In addition to storing \nenergy as triglycerides, WAT has endocrine activity and regulates many distal tissues.  \nAmong the molecules secreted by WAT is a group of metabolically active hormones, called \nthe adipokines (Trujillo & Scherer, 2006).  Within WAT, rhythmic gene expression is \nwidespread, with approximately 20% of the murine WAT transcriptome exhibiting 24 h \nvariation (Ptitsyn et al., 2006; Zvonic et al., 2006).  Furthermore, circadian regulation of \nendocrine activity is likely to be an important output of this tissue.  24 h variation of \nadipokine concentration has been reported in blood (Sinha et al., 1996; Kalsbeek et al., 2001; \nGavrila et al., 2003); this rhythmicity may have a transcriptional basis, as adipokine mRNA is \nsubject to 24 h variation in murine WAT (Ando et al., 2005). \n \n 3\nHowever, rhythmicity in adipocyte cells, per se, is poorly understood.  WAT contains many \ncell types, including adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, and vascular \nendothelial cells that may contribute to the reported rhythms of gene expression in murine \nWAT (Balsalobre et al., 1998; Hayashi et al., 2007; Takeda et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007).  \nMoreover, WAT, like other peripheral tissues, receives many rhythmic humoral and neuronal \ninputs (Balsalobre et al., 2000; Bartness et al., 2001; Pevet et al., 2006), which can directly \nregulate clock gene expression (Balsalobre et al., 2000; Johnston et al., 2006; Kornmann et \nal., 2007; Reddy et al., 2007; Wagner et al., 2007).  This rhythmical input may be driven both \nby endogenous circadian timing and also from masking effects of the light-dark cycle in \nwhich animals were kept in previous studies.  Here, we have used an in vitro approach to \nstudy rhythmicity in murine pre-adipocyte and adipocyte cells. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nAll experimental procedures conformed to published ethical standards (Portaluppi et \nal, 2008). \n \nCell culture \n3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (ATCC, LGC Standards, Teddington, Middlesex, UK) were cultured \nin growth medium [DMEM (Invitrogen Ltd, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% foetal \nbovine serum (Invitrogen), antibiotic\/antimycotic (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (Sigma-\nAldrich Co Ltd, Poole, Dorset, UK)]. Two days post-confluence (day 0), differentiation was \ninduced by adding 0.5mM IBMX (Sigma-Aldrich), 1\u03bcM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) and \n10\u03bcg\/ml insulin (Invitrogen).  After 48 h, medium was exchanged for growth medium \ncontaining 10\u03bcg\/ml insulin.  48 h later, this was exchanged for normal growth medium, which \nwas replaced every two days thereafter.  To characterize differentiation, RNA was extracted \n 4\nusing TRIzol (Invitrogen) for semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, and triglyceride \nanalyses were carried out on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes (two days post-\nconfluence) and differentiated adipocytes (day 8 post-differentiation induction) were pulsed \nwith 50% horse serum (Invitrogen) in DMEM for 2 h, as described previously (Balsalobre et \nal., 1998).  Medium was then replaced with serum-free DMEM for the remainder of the \nexperiment.  Every 4 h from initiation of the serum pulse (0 h), RNA was extracted for real-\ntime quantitative PCR, and medium was collected for analysis of adipokine secretion. \n \nOil red O stain \nCells were washed with 10% formalin in 1xPBS and then incubated in fresh formalin \nsolution for 1 h at room temperature.  Cells were washed twice with 60% ethanol, twice with \ndistilled water, and incubated in 0.18% oil red O solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min.  Cells \nwere washed three times with distilled water, and then photographed. \n \nQuantitative triglyceride analysis \nCells were rinsed twice with 1xPBS, scraped into 0.1M SDS solution in 1xPBS and \nlysed by vortex mixing and sonication.  Triglyceride was measured using an Alfa \nWassermann one-step triglyceride assay (Randox Laboratories Ltd, Crumlin, County Antrim, \nUK) adapted for 96-well plates.  Intra-assay coefficient of variance was 3.8%. \n \nReverse transcriptase PCR \nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed using random primers and M-MLV Reverse \nTranscriptase (Promega Corporation, Southampton, UK).  cDNA was then used for semi-\nquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) according \nto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Primers are shown in Table 1. \n 5\n Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) \ncDNA was synthesized as described above.  cDNA was then used for qPCR using \nABsolute\u2122 QPCR ROX Mix (Abgene, Epsom, UK).  Primer-probe sets are shown in Table \n2.  Standard curves (R2 > 0.99) were generated using murine genomic DNA (Promega). \n \nAdipokine assays \nAdipokine concentration was measured using Quantikine ELISA kits (R&D Systems \nEurope Ltd, Abingdon, UK).  Intra-assay coefficient of variance was 2.2% and 6.5% for \nleptin and adiponectin assays, respectively. \n \nStatistics \nQuantitative data represent the mean \u00b1SEM of n=3 groups of cells from a \nrepresentative experiment.  Serum pulse experiments were repeated two (pre-adipocyte) or \nthree (adipocyte) times, with similar data obtained from each replicate experiment.  \nTriglyceride accumulation and qPCR data were analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA , \nwith Least Square Difference post-hoc test, as appropriate.  Rate of adipokine secretion was \nmeasured by testing the departure of hormone accumulation from linearity, using a runs test.  \nSignificant difference was defined as p < 0.05. \n \nResults \nDifferentiation of 3T3-L1 cells \nLipid droplets were first observed four days after onset of differentiation and, by day \n8, many cells had large unilocular droplets (Figure 1A).  Quantitative analysis revealed \ntriglyceride elevation above undifferentiated cells by day 4, followed by rapid accumulation \n 6\nthereafter (Figure 1B).  PPAR\u03b3 mRNA was detectable in undifferentiated cells, but was \nelevated from day 2 through to day 10.  In contrast, expression of Glut-4 and Leptin was only \ndetected after two and four days of differentiation, respectively (Figure 1C). \n \n \nClock gene expression in pre-adipocytes and adipocytes \nFollowing a serum pulse, significant (p<0.001, one-way ANOVA) temporal variation \nof mRNA expression was observed in pre-adipocytes for all genes examined except Per1 \n(p>0.05, one-way ANOVA).  For Per2 and Dbp a rapid (within 4 h) effect was followed by a \npeak around 24 h post-pulse and an additional elevation in gene expression 24 h later.  Rev-\nerb\u03b1 exhibited two peaks, approximately 20 and 44 h post-pulse.  By contrast, Cry1 and \nBmal1 expression was acutely stimulated by the serum pulse, but then showed no clear \ncircadian variation (Figure 2 left). \n \nTreatment of differentiated adipocytes with a serum pulse induced significant \n(p<0.001, one-way ANOVA) variation in expression of all clock genes (Figure 2 right).  As in \npre-adipocytes, expression of Per1, Cry1, and Bmal1 in serum pulsed adipocytes did not \nappear to exhibit circadian rhythms.  Temporal variation of Per2, Dbp, and Rev-erb\u03b1 \nexpression was similar to that previously observed in the pre-adipocytes.  However, for all \nthree genes there were significant effects of both time and cell type (p<0.001, two-way \nANOVA) around the main peak, as measured between 16 and 32 h post-pulse.  There was \nalso a significant (p<0.001) interaction between time and cell type for Per2 and Dbp.  \nSubsequent post-hoc analysis revealed that, although there was no effect of cell type on gene \nexpression at 16 h post-pulse, Per2 and Dbp expression was significantly elevated in pre-\n 7\nadipocytes over the next three to four time points, indicating that the amplitude of Per2 and \nDbp rhythms in differentiated adipocytes was greatly attenuated (Figure 3). \n \nMetabolic gene expression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and adipocytes \nFollowing a serum pulse, both pre-adipocytes and adipocytes exhibited significant \n(p<0.05) temporal variation in SREBP1, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression.  In pre-\nadipocytes, SREBP1 and PPAR\u03b3 expression gradually decreased following the pulse, whereas \nPPAR\u03b1 exhibited an acute, transient suppression (Figure 4 left).  In adipocytes, expression of \nSREBP1 and PPAR\u03b1 gradually increased, with expression of PPAR\u03b1 decreasing again by 44 h \npost-pulse, but remaining constant in SREBP1 (Figure 4 right).  However, none of the genes \nshowed circadian variation of expression in either cell type. \n \nAdipokine mRNA expression and secretion from differentiated adipocytes \nFollowing a serum pulse, leptin and adiponectin concentration increased in the culture \nmedium in a non-linear fashion (p<0.05; Figure 5A).  The rate of secretion was estimated by \nplotting the difference in mean concentration between adjacent time points (Figure 5B).  \nLeptin secretion was low between 8-12 h post-pulse and then appeared to exhibit circadian \nrhythmicity, with a second nadir 24 h later (Figure 5B).  We were unable to detect circadian \nchanges in adiponectin secretion. Expression of Leptin (Figue 5C left) and Adiponectin \n(Figure 5C right) mRNA exhibited significant temporal variation (p<0.001) following a serum \npulse.  However, neither showed evidence of circadian rhythmicity. \n \nDiscussion \nIn order to directly address adipocyte rhythmicity, we studied the well-characterized \n3T3-L1 cell model.  Although these cells are known to express clock genes (Shimba et al., \n 8\n2005; Wang & Lazar, 2008), there are no available quantitative data describing temporal \nchanges in their physiology.  Consistent with the recent finding of circadian rhythms in \nhuman adipose-derived stem cells (Wu et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009), we observed \ncircadian variation of Per2, Dbp, and Rev-erb\u03b1 expression in both pre-adipocytes and \ndifferentiated adipocytes.  However, we surprisingly failed to observe circadian rhythmicity \nof Per1, Cry1, Bmal1, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1, Leptin, and Adiponectin mRNA, which are \nall rhythmic in murine WAT (Ando et al., 2005; Ptitsyn et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2006; Zvonic \net al., 2006).  Our data, therefore, suggest that some of the reported rhythmicity in murine \nWAT may derive from non-adipocyte cell types and\/or rhythmical input signal(s). \n \nFollowing the original description of circadian rhythms in a serum pulsed cell line, it \nwas suggested that the effect of the pulse was either to initiate circadian rhythms in individual \ncells or synchronize a population of cells, each of which contains a pre-existing intracellular \nclock (Balsalobre et al., 1998).  Elegant single cell imaging studies later provided strong \nexperimental support for the second of these possibilities (Nagoshi et al., 2004; Welsh et al., \n2004).  The fact that we observed rhythms of Rev-erb\u03b1, Per2, and Dbp in this study \ndemonstrates that the serum pulse employed was successful in synchronizing our cell \npopulation.  The lack of rhythmicity of other genes was thus unexpected.  Although very low-\namplitude rhythms of these genes may exist, our data suggest that an adipocyte clock is \ninsufficient to drive rhythmic expression of these mRNAs in 3T3-L1 cells.  Future work will \ninvestigate the molecular basis of this surprising finding. \n \nThe amplitude of Per2 and Dbp rhythms in adipocyte cells was clearly less than that \nof the equivalent pre-adipocytes.  As circadian clocks reside within individual cells (Welsh et \nal., 1995; Nagoshi et al,. 2004; Welsh et al., 2004), the dampened rhythms observed in our \n 9\nexperiments may conceivably be due to attenuated intra-cellular rhythm amplitude or a \ndecreased ability of the serum pulse to synchronize the cell population.  Although we cannot \nyet rule out poorer inter-cellular synchronizsation behind the reduced rhythmicity in the 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes, attenuated amplitude of the rhythmicity in adipose tissue from obese mice \n(Ando et al., 2005; Kohsaka et al., 2007) is consistent with a possible inhibition of the \nmolecular clock mechanism by intra-cellular triglyceride accumulation. \n \nIn addition to control of mRNA expression, our data indicate that adipocyte clocks \nmay drive circadian secretion of leptin, but not adiponectin.  Although the reduction of leptin \nsecretion between 8 and 12 h post-pulse coincides with reduced mRNA expression, later \ntemporal fluctuations of leptin secretion do not parallel mRNA levels.  This finding is \nconsistent with a previous observation that hepatic protein rhythms do not necessarily reflect \ntemporal mRNA expression in the same tissue (Reddy et al., 2006).  24 h rhythms of plasma \nleptin and adiponectin have previously been reported in humans and rodents by some \ninvestigators (Sinha et al., 1996; Kalsbeek et al., 2001; Gavrila et al., 2003).  However, this is \nthe first indication of an adipocyte-based mechanism driving rhythmic plasma leptin \nconcentration, as opposed to other possible contributory factors, such as changes in hormone \nclearance or secretory control by input pathway(s).  Based on our data, such mechanisms may \ncontribute towards the 24 h variation of plasma adiponectin concentrations that have been \nreported in vivo.  Future analysis of rhythmic adipokine secretion from adipocyte cultures will \nneed to consider hormone half life.  Previous studies of plasma and intracellular hormone \ndynamics have estimated half-lives of approximately 30 min for leptin (Klein et al., 1996; \nHarris et al., 1997) and 3 h for adiponectin (Hoffstedt et al., 2004; Clasen et al., 2005), but \ntheir half-life in culture medium is unclear. \n \n 10\nAlthough this study increases current knowledge of the interaction between circadian \nclocks and adipocyte biology, there are a number of ways in which the work could be usefully \nextended.  Despite the 3T3-L1 cell line being frequently used as a model for adipocyte \nphysiology, it is quite possible that there are differences in circadian biology between these \ncells and primary mouse adipocytes.  Thus, we have employed some caution when comparing \nour data with published data describing murine WAT gene expression.  It would also be \nbeneficial to lengthen the time course of the study in order to allow more detailed analysis of \nthe nature of adipocyte rhythmicity, including calculation of rhythm period and phase.  One \nway of achieving this aim would be to employ real-time reporter imaging technology.  Indeed, \nreal-time analysis of Bmal1, Per1, and Cry1 promoter activity in living cells may reveal \ncircadian changes of gene expression that were not detected using our standard serum pulse \nprotocol. \n \nIn summary, this study provides evidence for an endogenous adipocyte clock that \ncontrols rhythmic expression of a subset of genes found to be rhythmic in WAT.  The \nadipocyte clock may also regulate endocrine activity.  These data, therefore, strengthen the \nview that circadian rhythms have functional relevance to adipose biology, lipid metabolism, \nand related pathophysiology. \nAcknowledgements \nWe acknowledge M Raven and Drs J Lodge, K Plant and A Thumser for assistance during \noptimisation of the techniques used in this work.
