Introduction\nThe purpose of this note is to determine all endotrivial modules in prime characteristic p, for a\nfinite group having a cyclic Sylow p-subgroup. In other words, we describe completely the group\nof endotrivial modules in that case.\nThe endotrivial modules are a family of finitely generated modules for a group algebra of a finite\ngroup which appear naturally in modular representation theory. Several contributions towards a\ngeneral classification have already been obtained (cf. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and [8]).\nWe write T (G) for the group of endotrival modules for the finite group G. Assume that G has\na cyclic Sylow p-subgroup P and let H be the normalizer in G of the unique subgroup of P of\norder p. We prove here that induction and restriction induce inverse isomorphisms T (G) \u223c= T (H)\nand that T (H) is generated by one-dimensional representations of H together with the class of the\nfirst syzygy of the trivial module, subject to a single explicit relation.\n2. Preliminaries\nThroughout this note, we let k be an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic p. If G is\na finite group, all kG-modules are finitely generated (left) modules and the symbol \u2297 stands for\nthe tensor product \u2297k of modules over the ground field, with diagonal group action of G.\nDefinition 2.1. Let G be a finite group. A kG-module M is endotrivial if its endomorphism\nalgebra EndkM is isomorphic (as kG-module) to the direct sum of the one-dimensional trivial\nmodule and a projective module. Alternatively,M is endotrivial if and only ifM\u2217\u2297M \u223c= k\u2295(proj),\nwhere M\u2217 denotes the k-dual of M .\nHere are some of the basic properties of endotrivial modules (cf. [7], [4], or [2]).\nLemma 2.2. Let G be a finite group.\n(1) If M is an endotrivial kG-module, then M splits as the direct sum M0 \u2295 (proj) for an\nindecomposable endotrivial kG-module M0, unique up to isomorphism. Here (proj) denotes\nsome projective module.\n(2) The relation\nM \u223c N \u21d0\u21d2 M0 \u223c= N0\non the class of endotrivial kG-modules is an equivalence relation. We let T (G) be the set\nof equivalence classes. Every equivalence class contains a unique indecomposable module\nup to isomorphism.\n(3) The tensor product \u2297 induces an abelian group structure on the set T (G):\n[M ] + [N ] = [M \u2297N ] .\nDate: May 21, 2007.\nResearch supported by the research fellowship PA002-113164\/1 of the Swiss National Foundation.\n1\n2 NADIA MAZZA AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nThe zero element of T (G) is the class [k] of the trivial module, consisting of all modules of\nthe form k \u2295 (proj).\nThe group T (G) is called the group of endotrivial kG-modules. It is known to be a finitely\ngenerated abelian group. In particular, the torsion subgroup T t(G) of T (G) is finite. The rank\nof T (G) can be described explicitly (see [2]). For groups with a cyclic Sylow p-subgroup, T (G) =\nT t(G) is a finite group, as we shall see in the main theorem. This also follows immediately from\nthe fact that there are finitely many indecomposable kG-modules up to isomorphism.\nAn important family of endotrivial modules is provided by the syzygies \u2126nG(k) of the trivial\nmodule. Recall that \u2126nG(k) is the kernel of the (n \u2212 1)st differential in a minimal kG-projective\nresolution of the trivial module k.\nNotation 2.3. We write \u2126G for the class of \u21261G(k) in T (G).\nRecall that we have n\u2126G = [\u2126nG(k)] in T (G), for all n \u2208 Z.\nFor p-groups, it turns out in many cases that the syzygies of the trivial module are the only\nindecomposable endotrivial modules (up to isomorphism). It is for instance the case in the following\nresult of Dade (cf. [7]).\nTheorem 2.4. Let P be an abelian p-group. Then\nT (P ) = \u3008\u2126P \u3009 \u223c=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 0 if |P | \u2264 2,Z\/2Z if P is cyclic and |P | \u2265 3,Z otherwise.\nNotation 2.5. If G is a finite group, we denote by X(G) the abelian group of all isomorphism\nclasses of one-dimensional kG-modules (for the group law induced by \u2297). This group can also be\nidentified with the group Hom(G, k\u00d7) of k\u00d7-valued linear characters of G, where k\u00d7 = k \u2212 {0}.\nThe group X(G) is a p\u2032-group, isomorphic to the p\u2032-part of the abelianization G\/[G,G].\nIt is obvious that any one-dimensional module is endotrivial and we let X \u2032(G) be the image of\nthe embedding\nX(G) \u2212\u2192 T (G) , \u00b5 7\u2192 [\u00b5]\nmapping a one-dimensional module to its class in T (G). Note that X \u2032(G) is isomorphic to X(G),\nbut it is written additively : [\u03bb] + [\u00b5] = [\u03bb \u00b7 \u00b5].\nIf H is a subgroup of G, we write H \u2264 G. For a kG-module M , we denote by M \u2193GH the\nrestriction of M to kH, and for a kH-module N , we write N \u2191GH for the induction of N to kG. It\nis clear that restriction induces a group homomorphism\nResGH : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (H)\nand we note that ResGH(\u2126G) = \u2126H , because \u2126\n1\nG(k)\u2193GH \u223c= \u21261H(k)\u2295 (proj).\nIf H, K \u2264 G, we write [G\/H] and [K\\G\/H] for sets of representatives of the left H\u2212cosets and\nof the (K \u2212H)\u2212double cosets in G, respectively. If x \u2208 G and H \u2264 G, we write xy and xH for the\nelement xyx\u22121 and the subgroup xHx\u22121 of G, respectively.\nLemma 2.6. Let G be a finite group and let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Assume that for all\nx \u2208 G the subgroup xP \u2229 P is non trivial. Then, the kernel of the restriction map ResGP : T (G)\u2192\nT (P ) is equal to X \u2032(G).\nProof. Assume M is an indecomposable kG-module such that M \u2193GP = k\u2295 (proj). By the Mackey\ndecomposition formula and relative projectivity, we have that M \u2193GP is also a direct summand of\nk\u2191GP \u2193GP \u223c= k|NG(P ):P | \u2295\n\u2295\nx\u2208A\nk\u2191PxP\u2229P \u223c= k|NG(P ):P | \u2295 V ,\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE CYCLIC CASE 3\nwhere A = {x \u2208 [P\\G\/P ] | x 6\u2208 NG(P )} and where V has no projective summand. Indeed, since\nthe p-group xP \u2229P is nontrivial, each indecomposable kP -module k\u2191PxP\u2229P appearing above is not\nprojective and has vertex xP \u2229P strictly contained in P , for all x 6\u2208 NG(P ). Now on the one hand\nM \u2193GP = k \u2295 (proj), and on the other hand M \u2193GP is a direct summand of k|NG(P ):P | \u2295 V . By the\nKrull-Schmidt theorem, this forces M \u2193GP = k. Thus M belongs to X(G). \u0003\nNote that Lemma 2.6 applies in particular when Op(G) is nontrivial.\nFor our next lemma, we recall that a subgroup H of G is strongly p-embedded if p divides the\norder of H and if xH \u2229H is a group of order prime to p, for all x \u2208 G\u2212H. Note that any strongly\np-embedded subgroup of G contains the normalizer in G of a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\nLemma 2.7. Let H be a subgroup of G containing the normalizer N of a Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n(1) The restriction map ResGH : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (H) is injective. More precisely, if M is an inde-\ncomposable endotrivial kG-module and if M \u2193GH = L\u2295 (proj) where L is an indecomposable\nkH-module, then M is the Green correspondent of L.\n(2) Assume that H is strongly p-embedded in G. Then ResGH : T (G) \u2212\u2192 T (H) is an isomor-\nphism. Moreover, the inverse map is induced by induction. On indecomposable endotrivial\nmodules, the inverse map is induced by the Green correspondence.\nProof. The first statement is proven in [2, Proposition 2.6]. Let us give the argument again. SinceH\ncontains N , the Green correspondence yields a one-to-one correspondence between indecomposable\nmodules for G and H having a common vertex. The Green correspondent of an indecomposable\nendotrivial kH-module L is an indecomposable kG-moduleM with vertex a Sylow subgroup. This\nmodule M might or might not be endotrivial. If it is, then ResGH([M ]) = [L] and the uniqueness\nof M shows the injectivity of the map ResGH .\nThe second statement is proven in [2, Proposition 2.8]. By (1), the restriction map ResGH is\ninjective. Now let L be an indecomposable endotrivial kH-module. The Mackey formula yields\nL\u2191GH \u2193GH \u223c=\n\u2295\nx\u2208[H\\G\/H]\nxL\u2193xHxH\u2229H \u2191HxH\u2229H \u223c= L\u2295 (proj) .\nIndeed, for any x \u2208 G\u2212H, the subgroup xH \u2229H of H has order prime to p, which implies that the\nkH-module L\u2193xHxH\u2229H \u2191HxH\u2229H is projective. It follows that L\u2191GH is an endotrivial kG-module. Thus\nthe kG-Green correspondent of any indecomposable endotrivial kH-module is an indecomposable\nendotrivial kG-module. \u0003\n3. Cyclic Sylow p-subgroups\nIn this section, we determine completely T (G) for a finite group G having a nontrivial cyclic\nSylow p-subgroup P . We let Z be the unique subgroup of P of order p, and we let H = NG(Z) be\nits normalizer in G. Our first purpose is to work out the structure of T (H).\nThe quotient H\/CG(Z) embeds as a subgroup of Aut(Z) and is therefore a cyclic group Ce of\norder e, for some integer e dividing p\u2212 1. Given c \u2208 H, then for all u \u2208 Z we have\ncu = u\u03bd(c), for some \u03bd(c) \u2208 (Z\/pZ)\u00d7 ,\nand we view \u03bd(c) as an element of k\u00d7 via the embedding Z\/pZ\u2192 k. This defines a linear character\n\u03bd : H \u2192 k\u00d7 with kernel CG(Z). For simplicity of notation, we identify \u03bd with a one- dimensional\nkH-module, hence an element of X(H).\nThe main ingredient is the following well-known result.\nProposition 3.1. Let H = NG(Z). The projective cover Fk of the trivial kH-module k is uniserial,\nof length |P | and dimension |P |. Its composition factors are k, \u03bd, \u03bd2, . . . , \u03bdp\u22122, k, or more precisely\nRadj(Fk)\/Radj+1(Fk) \u223c= \u03bdj for all j = 0, . . . , p\u2212 1.\n4 NADIA MAZZA AND JACQUES THE\u00b4VENAZ\nProof. The result is part of the structure of blocks with cyclic defect groups and can be found for\ninstance in [1, Proposition 6.5.4], except for the explicit description of Rad(Fk)\/Rad2(Fk) as the\nabove one-dimensional module \u03bd.\nWe sketch here a direct proof. We first show that the group K = CG(Z) has a normal p-\ncomplement. The group NK(P )\/CK(P ) is a p\u2032- group of automorphisms of P , hence completely\ndetermined by its restriction to Z. ButK = CG(Z) acts trivially on Z and thereforeNK(P )\/CK(P )\nis trivial. Thus NK(P ) = CK(P ) and Burnside\u2019s transfer theorem applies, proving that K has a\nnormal p-complement M .\nSinceM = Op\u2032(K) andK is normal inH,M is a normal subgroup ofH. We haveK\/M \u223c= P and\nH\/M \u223c= P oCe, because H\/K \u223c= Ce and P has a complement Ce in H\/M by the Schur-Zassenhaus\ntheorem.\nThe projective cover of k as a k[H\/M ]-module is also a projective cover of k as a kH-module\nbecauseM is a normal p\u2032-subgroup. Thus it suffices to prove the result for the groupH\/M \u223c= PoC,\nwhere we write C = Ce.\nNow P acts on P by left multiplication and C acts on P by conjugation. These actions are\ncompatible in the sense that they define an action of PoC on P . Therefore F = kP has a structure\nof k[PoC]-module (actually a permutation module k\u2191PoCC ). The unique series of submodules of F\nas a kP -module is invariant under C and therefore F is uniserial of length |P | and dimension |P |.\nExplicitly, Radj(F )\/Radj+1(F ) = (x\u2212 1)jF\/(x\u2212 1)j+1F , where x is a generator of P .\nBy expanding\n(\n(x \u2212 1) + 1)m, one can see that xm \u2212 1 \u2261 m(x \u2212 1) (mod (x \u2212 1)2) and hence\n(xm \u2212 1)j \u2261 mj(x\u2212 1)j (mod (x\u2212 1)j+1). Now the conjugation action of c \u2208 C on P is given by\ncx = x\u03bd(c) by definition of \u03bd. The congruence above with m = \u03bd(c) shows that the action of c on\n(x\u2212 1)jF\/(x\u2212 1)j+1F is multiplication by \u03bd(c)j . Therefore (x\u2212 1)jF\/(x\u2212 1)j+1F \u223c= \u03bdj . \u0003\nTheorem 3.2. Let G be a finite group with a cyclic Sylow p-subgroup P . Let Z be the unique\nsubgroup of P of order p, and let H = NG(Z).\n(1) There is an exact sequence\n0 \/\/ X \u2032(H) \/\/ T (H)\nResHP \/\/ T (P ) \/\/ 0 .\n(2) If |P | = 2, then T (P ) = {0} and T (H) = X \u2032(H).\n(3) If |P | > 2, then T (P ) = \u3008\u2126P \u3009 \u223c= Z\/2Z and\nT (H) = \u3008X \u2032(H), \u2126H\u3009 \u223c=\n(\nX \u2032(H)\u2295 \u3008\u2126H\u3009\n) \/ \u2329\n([\u03bd]\u2212 2\u2126H)\n\u232a\n,\nwhere [\u03bd] \u2208 X \u2032(H) is the class of \u03bd \u2208 X(H).\n(4) The exact sequence above splits if and only if \u03bd is a square in X(H). In particular, the\nsequence splits if the integer e = |NG(Z)\/CG(Z)| is odd.\nProof. Since P is cyclic, we have T (P ) = \u3008\u2126P \u3009, by Theorem 2.4. It is trivial if |P | = 2 and has\norder 2 otherwise. Moreover, ResHP is surjective because Res\nH\nP (\u2126H) = \u2126P . Since Z is a non-trivial\nnormal subgroup of H, Ker(ResHP ) = X\n\u2032(H) by Lemma 2.6. This proves (1) and (2).\nAssume |P | > 2. Since \u2126H is a preimage of the generator \u2126P of T (P ), we need to identify 2\u2126H\nas an element of X \u2032(H). We claim that 2\u2126H = [\u03bd], from which (3) follows. We need to compute\n\u21262H(k) (since its class in T (H) is 2\u2126H). From Proposition 3.1, we see that \u2126\n1\nH(k) = Rad(Fk)\n(with compositions factors \u03bd, \u03bd2, . . . , \u03bdp\u22122, k). Its projective cover is \u03bd \u2297 Fk (with compositions\nfactors \u03bd, \u03bd2, . . . , k, \u03bd) and therefore \u21262H(k) is the bottom composition factor of \u03bd \u2297 Fk, namely \u03bd,\nas claimed.\nWe are left with the proof of (4). If |P | = 2, then the sequence splits trivially and on the\nother hand \u03bd is a square because it is trivial (e = 1). Assume now that |P | > 2. Since \u2126H is a\npreimage of the generator \u2126P of T (P ), the sequence splits if and only if there exists \u00b5 \u2208 X(H)\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES IN THE CYCLIC CASE 5\nsuch that [\u00b5] \u2212 \u2126H has order 2, or in other words 2[\u00b5] = [\u03bd]. Going back to X(H) and its\nmultiplicative notation, we see that the condition is that \u03bd must be a square in X(H). For the\nspecial case, note that \u03bd is an element of order e, because it is a generator of the character group\nof NG(Z)\/CG(Z) \u223c= Ce. If e is odd, then \u03bd is (necessarily) a square. \u0003\nRemark 3.3. \u2126H has order 2e in T (H), because \u03bd has order e and 2\u2126H = [\u03bd].\nRemark 3.4. Any element of T (H) has the form [\u03bb] + j\u2126H for some \u03bb \u2208 X(H). This is the class\nof the endotrivial module \u2126jH(\u03bb). Thus we can also describe T (H) as the group whose elements\nare the equivalence classes of the syzygies of the one-dimensional modules.\nIn order to pass from the subgroup H = NG(Z) to the whole group G, we need the following\nobservation.\nLemma 3.5. The subgroup H = NG(Z) is strongly p-embedded in G. Hence, ResGH : T (G)\u2192 T (H)\nis an isomorphism (with inverse map induced by induction or Green correspondence).\nProof. Let x \u2208 G such that p divides the order of xH \u2229 H, that is, there exists a nontrivial p-\nsubgroup Q of G such that Q \u2264 xP \u2229 P . Since Z is the unique subgroup of P of order p, we have\nthat Z \u2264 xH \u2229H. This forces the equality xZ = Z, and hence x \u2208 H, as was to be shown.\nThe second claim is a direct application of Lemma 2.7. \u0003\nOur final result follows immediately from the previous lemma.\nTheorem 3.6. Let G be a finite group with a cyclic Sylow p- subgroup P . Let Z be the unique\nsubgroup of P of order p, and let H = NG(Z). Then\nT (G) = { [IndGHM ] | [M ] \u2208 T (H) } \u223c= T (H) .\nAlternatively, if \u0393(M) denotes the Green correspondent of an indecomposable kH-module M , then\nT (G) = { [\u0393(M)] |M is an indecomposable endotrivial kH-module } \u223c= T (H) .\nWe see in particular that there exist often indecomposable endotrivial kG-modules which are\nneither one-dimensional nor syzygies of a one-dimensional module. Indeed the Green correspondent\nof a one-dimensional kH-module is in general not one-dimensional.\nReferences\n[1] D. J.
