Introduction\nCells of all living organisms require a variety of biochemical nutrients in order to function\nnormally and to respond to environmental signals. In tissues larger than a critical size,\ndiffusion of these substances is an inadequate supply method and a circulatory system is\nneeded. Important examples of this phenomenon include solid-tumour and healing-wound\ntissue, both of which are restricted to a linear dimension of a few millimetres until they\nare invaded by blood capillaries (Alberts et al, 1989; Clark, 1993; Folkman & Shing,\n1992).\nAngiogenesis, denned as the ingrowth of a capillary network from pre-existing ves-\nsels in the surrounding tissue, may therefore be either beneficial (as in wound healing)\nor detrimental (as in tumour growth). Thus, increasing understanding of the biological\nmechanisms involved in angiogenesis and of how these processes are regulated are impor-\ntant steps in improving clinical treatments for malignant tumours and abnormally healing\nwounds.\nIn this paper, we propose a continuum mathematical model for wound-healing angio-\ngenesis which can be used to investigate the regulatory roles of the solid-state extracellular\nmatrix (ECM) in the behaviour of blood capillaries.\n1.1 Biological background\nMammalian skin cells obtain vital metabolites such as oxygen from an extensive capil-\nlary network throughout the dermis, which is connected to larger arteries and veins in the\nsubdermal layers (Mast, 1992). Consequently, the dermal response to injury must not only\nrestore this capillary network but must also provide extra nutrients for the increased num-\nber of metabolically active cells involved in repair (Arnold & West, 1992). Angiogenesis,\nwhich typically parallels fibroplasia and wound contraction (from a couple of days to a\ncouple of weeks post-wounding), is therefore a key event in the healing of full-thickness\ndermal excisional skin wounds (Clark, 1993).\nIn normal unwounded skin, blood capillaries constitute an essentially quiescent net-\nwork of endothelial cells which are organized into tubular structures. Laminae of insoluble\nextracellular matrix (ECM) proteins known as the basement membrane coat the exterior\nof blood capillaries and are believed to maintain endothelial stability, impermeability,\nand resistance against the hydrostatic pressure of the blood flow within vessels\n(Ryan, 1989).\nAn early event in wound angiogenesis is the proteolytic degradation of the basement-\nmembrane ECM of vessels around the wound margins in response to wound-induced an-\ngiogenic stimuli. These signals probably arise from the enzymatic cascades which char-\nacterize the early, inflammatory phase of repair (Clark, 1993), although wound-induced\nvessel dilation may also be significant (Whalen & Zetter, 1992).\nAt vessel locations where the basement membrane has been degraded, capillary endothe-\nlial cells become activated, assuming a migratory and proliferative phenotype (Folkman &\nShing, 1992). A few cells initially migrate out from the capillary wall towards the wound\nsite, possibly mediated by basement-membrane fragments, by exposure to the connective-\ntissue ECM, or in response to (diffusible) angiogenic factors in the wound (Iruela-Arispe\n& Sage, 1993; Mardri & Pratt, 1988).\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 263\nImmediately behind the advancing endothelial bud, cells proliferate and differentiate\ninto tubular morphologies, thereby forming a new capillary (Ingber & Folkman, 1989a).\nCells further behind the leading tip also begin to synthesize new ECM substances\u2014notably\ncollagen, the predominant protein of normal dermis.\nBlood flow is restored when two new capillary tips join to form a closed loop. Secondary\nbuds may sprout from these new vessels via similar mechanisms of endothelial-cell activa-\ntion, migration, and proliferation. In this way, the wound tissue becomes endowed with a\ndense network of fine blood capillaries which, in time, develop into mature, quiescent ves-\nsels with increasing diameters and ECM (especially basement membrane) deposition. The\ntotal number of vessels declines from its peak around a week post-wounding, although the\nmechanisms of vascular maturation and regression are unclear (Dyson etal., 1992; Whalen\n&Zetter, 1992).\nThe factors which regulate wound angiogenesis have attracted considerable recent re-\nsearch (for reviews see Arnold & West, 1992; Folkman & Shing, 1992; Whalen & Zetter,\n1992); they may be broadly subdivided into the following two categories:\n(i) soluble signals, cytokines (for example, fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived\ngrowth factor), metabolic gradients (for example, in oxygen and lactate), and pro-\nteases (for example, collagenase, plasminogen activator, and urokinase).\n(ii) insoluble signals, ECM substrate (for example, fibrillar collagen and fibronectin)\nand physical forces (the morphology and behaviour of capillary endothelial cells is\ninfluenced by mechanical stresses in vitro).\nAlthough many factors have been shown to affect endothelial-cell function in culture,\ntheir roles in vivo are difficult to assess experimentally, because of the multiple direct\nand indirect interactions between individual components of the overall wound-healing\nprocess.\nSoluble (or diffusible) angiogenic regulators have been more widely studied. Gradi-\nents of metabolic factors (such as oxygen and lactate) across a wound are believed to\nregulate endothelial-cell activity, whilst growth factors may stimulate cell movement (via\nchemotaxis), proliferation, and ECM synthesis (Drucker etal., 1996; Jonsson etal., 1991;\nKnighton et al., 1982). Proteolytic enzymes also mediate cell-ECM interactions such as\nattachment, detachment, and force transduction between the intracellular cytoskeleton and\nthe ECM (Ingber, 1993; Ryan, 1989).\nThe fibrillar ECM is undoubtedly an important local regulator of angiogenesis. For ex-\nample, the concentrations of collagen and\/or fibronectin substrates may determine whether\ncultured capillary endothelial cells migrate, proliferate, or differentiate into tubular,\ncapillary-like structures (Ingber & Folkman, 1989a: Ryan, 1989). These substrates have\nalso been demonstrated to promote cell movement by haptotaxis, haptokinesis, and con-\ntact guidance in vitro (Dickinson & Tranquillo, 1993; McCarthy etal., 1988). In addition,\ninhibition of ECM remodelling modulates angiogenesis (Ingber & Folkman, 1988). The\nfurther roles of the ECM in angiogenesis include the mediation of growth-factor-driven\nendothelial-cell behaviour (Iruela-Arispe & Sage, 1993; Sato etal., 1993) and support for\nthe mechanical effects of cell-ECM interactions (for example, cell traction) which may or-\nchestrate wound healing via directional cues and ECM-fibre alignment (Clark, 1993; Ryan,\n1989; Stopak & Harris, 1982; Vernon & Sage, 1995).\n264 L. OLSEN ET AL.\n1.2 Mathematical-modelling background\nRecently, Chaplain and colleagues have proposed continuum mathematical models for\nthe (diffusible) chemical regulation of tumour angiogenesis (Byrne & Chaplain, 1995;\nChaplain & Stuart, 1991a,b). Specifically, a generic tumour angiogenesis factor is secreted\nby the tumour, diffuses freely in the tissue, decays naturally, and is metabolized by cap-\nillary endothelial cells. In addition, these cells proliferate and migrate chemotactically\nin response to the chemical. These dynamics are modelled using two coupled nonlinear\npartial differential equations, governing: (i) the chemical concentration, and (ii) the den-\nsity of capillary-tip endothelial cells. Variants of the basic model framework account for\ncapillary-loop formation and for the dynamics of intact blood vessels behind the leading\ncapillary tips.\nGiven the recognized biological similarities between tumour and wound angiogenesis\n(Chaplain & Byrne, 1996; Folkman & Shing, 1992), the above model framework may also\nbe relevant to wound healing, wherein growth factors released at the wound site by in-\nflammatory cells perform analogous roles to the tumour angiogenesis factor. Some authors\nhave now considered this application of the 'generalized' chemically regulated angiogen-\nesis model (Chaplain & Byrne, 1996; Pettet etal., 1996).\n2. A new mathematical model\nPrevious mathematical models have neglected the ECM involvement in angiogenesis. In\nthis work, we develop and analyse a new model, based on a framework similar to that\noutlined above, to investigate how interactions between capillary endothelial cells and the\nsolid-state ECM substrate may regulate wound angiogenesis. Our model has a relatively\nsimple form, and represents a first attempt to simulate the ECM-endothelial-cell interac-\ntion during wound angiogenesis. Potential extensions to more realistic representations are\ndiscussed in Section 6.\n2.1 Framework and variables\nThe independent variables are as follows.\n(i) Time, \/, measured from the onset of the proliferative phase of repair when angiogen-\nesis commences\u2014usually 2 or 3 days post-wounding (Clark, 1993).\n(ii) Spatial position, r; we neglect the effects of wound depth and consider the one-\ndimensional (ID) geometry in the plane of skin suggested by a long rectangular (or\n'linear') wound, where \u2014 L ^ x ^ L defines the wound space, with the wound\ncentre at x = 0. The unwounded dermis occupies the region \\x\\ > L.\nThe dependent variables must, at least, represent the blood capillaries and the insoluble\nECM. In order to simulate their interactions within the context of a healing wound rather\nthan in the immediate vicinity of individual capillaries, these quantities are defined as local\nspatial continuum averages:\n(i) capillary endothelial-cell density, n(x, t); note that this term does not account for the\ncapillary orientation, which would require a more complicated vector-field represen-\ntation (which is beyond the scope of this paper);\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 265\n(ii) solid-state fibrillar ECM density, m(x, t), whose properties are modelled on those of\ncollagen, the predominant structural protein of the dermis.\n2.2 One-dimensional model equations\nAs detailed above, we consider the following, fundamental biological interactions between\n(capillary endothelial) cells and the (collagenous) ECM that are known to occur during\nwound angiogenesis:\nCells, unbiased migration mediated by the ECM (haptokinesis), biased migration up ECM\ndensity gradients (haptotaxis), and mitotic division (proliferation);\nECM, production (biosynthesis) and degradation (proteolysis) by cells.\nThus, the ECM regulates cell movement and proliferation\u2014experimentally, these effects\nare stimulatory at low ECM densities and inhibitory at relatively high densities (Dickin-\nson & Tranquillo, 1993; Nusgens et al, 1984; Weinberg & Bell, 1985; Yoshizato et al,\n1985).\nThe above considerations suggest the following model equations, which govern the cell\nand ECM densities:\nhaptotaxis and haptokinesis\nproliferation\ni\u2014-D(m)\u2014\\=[A(m)-Bn]n = f(n,m), (1)\nat ox |_ ox ox J\nproduction and\ndegradation\ndm\n\u2014 = (P-Qm)n=g(n,m).

By symmetry,\nsolutions need only be defined on the semi-infinite domain x ^ 0 subject to zero flux at\nthe wound centre; that is, C(m)n dm\/dx = D(m) dn\/dx at x = 0. Also, the cell and ECM\n266 L.

Their local stability is deduced from linear analysis, and the global stability is\ninvestigated using standard phase-plane analysis of the spatially independent system. The\nfollowing results are obtained.\n(i) A continuum of unstable 'acellular' states, in which n = 0 and m is unspecified,\n(ii) A globally stable state, in which n = A(m)\/B and m = P\/Q. These values are\npositive, and equated to n0 and m0, respectively, so that this 'dermal' steady state\nrepresents normal, unwounded tissue.\nThese results imply that the initial 'wound state' evolves towards the same dermal state as\nexisted before injury, which is indicative of wound healing. The spatiotemporal nature of\nthese dynamics and the roles of the biological processes in the model will be investigated\nin the remainder of the paper.\n2.5 Nondimensionalization\nThe variables and parameters in equations (1) and (2) and their associated end conditions\nare transformed into dimensionless quantities via the following scalings:\n~ t _ x \u201e n _ m C{m)T ~ D(m)T\nt = \u2014, x = - , n = ~ , m = \u2014 , x(w) = \u2014 T T \u2014 , D{m) = \u2014-r\u2014,\nT L no mo Ll Ll\nm^aim) = A(m)T, fi = BnoT, e = Qn0T,\nmo\nThe time scale, T, is defined as 1 day.

A numerical simulation of vascular growth into a wound. The wavefronts (a, b) of the endothelial-cell\ndensity and (c, d) of the ECM density move into the wound in parallel. We plot the solutions at time i = 0 and\nat ten successive unit intervals. The wound space is assumed to be one dimensional, so that we are modelling the\nhealing of an incisional wound. The point x = 1 corresponds to the initial wound edge, and x = 0 corresponds\nto the wound centre. The model equations (3) and (4) were solved numerically using methods described in the\nAppendix. The end conditions are given in the text. The parameter values were: (a, c) Do = 0.005, KD = 0.5,\nXo = 0.001, KX = 0.5, a0 = I 01, Ka = 0.1, fi = I, e = 1, and ;\u00abiml = 0.1; (b,d) the same except that\ne = 0.2, representing slower ECM kinetics. The finite-difference approximation mesh sizes. A* = Af = 0.005,\nare considerably smaller than the bounds for numerical stability, in order to yield high accuracy. The arrows\nindicate the direction of the wavelike propagation of the cells and ECM towards the wound centre.\n3. Numerical simulations\nNumerical solutions of equations (3) and (4) with the nondimensional end conditions are\nobtained using a semi-implicit finite-difference scheme (see the Appendix for details).\nA typical numerical simulation of the model is presented in Fig. 1, which shows the\nendothelial cell density, n, and the ECM density, m, propagating into the wound space\n(0 ^ x ^ 1) in a wavelike form. The key features of these dynamics are:\n(i) the cell and ECM profiles appear to evolve with approximately constant speed and\nform, after an initial transient and before the profiles reach the wound centre (x = 0);\n(ii) the cell density increases above its normal dermal value (unity) in the wavefront before\ngradually returning to its unwounded level, whereas the ECM profile is monotonically\nincreasing;\n268 L. OLSEN ET AL.\n(iii) the gradients of the profiles are steeper in the wavefront than in the waveback.\nThese phenomena simulate some important qualitative aspects of wound angiogenesis\nin vivo; in particular, endothelial-cell number increases sharply prior to a gradual regres-\nsion which parallels ECM accumulation. In Section 8, we will discuss in vitro procedures\nwhich could be used to replicate these results in detail.\nFigure 1 also illustrates that these features are more pronounced, and more realistic,\nwhen the ECM kinetics rate parameter e is smaller. In wound healing, ECM remodelling\noccurs on a slower time scale than cellular proliferation (Clark, 1988), implying that this\nparameter should be relatively small in magnitude (Olsen etai, 1995).\n4. Travelling-wave analysis\nThe forms of the numerical solutions of the model suggest that profiles with constant speed\nand form may evolve from the initial conditions. If so, then the dependence of these at-\ntributes on the biological parameters in the model are of central importance in gaining\ninsight into ECM regulation of wound angiogenesis. Travel ling-wave solutions have been\nobserved in other nonlinear parabolic partial-differential-equation models in cellular bio-\nlogy and wound healing (Byrne & Chaplain, 1995; Dale et al., 1994; Olsen et al., 1996;\nSherratt et al., 1992).\n4.1 Existence of travelling-wave solutions\nWe begin our analysis by considering the possible speeds for which the model equations\nhave wave solutions of the form observed in simulations of wound healing (see Fig. 1). This\nis an essential precursor to determining an expression for the wave speed in terms of the\nmodel parameters. Such an expression is discussed further in Section 6, and it corresponds\nbiologically to the predicted speed of vascular ingrowth.\nTravelling-wave solutions are investigated first by the variable transformations\nz=x + ct, N(z) = n{x,t), M(z) = m(x,t),\nwhere c > 0 is the constant wave speed. Substituting into equations (3) and (4) yields the\nfollowing system of ordinary differential equations:\ncN' + [x(M)NM' - D(M)N']' = f(N, M) = [a(M) - N]N, (5)\ncM' - g(N,M) = e(\\ -M)N, (6)\nwhere the primes denote differentiation with respect to z.\nIf travelling-wave solutions exist, then a heteroclinic trajectory must exist from the\n'wounded equilibrium' (0,0, Wjnj,) to the 'dermal equilibrium' (1,0, 1) in (N,N', M)-\nspace, lying wholly in the biologically realistic region N ^ 0, M > 0. The existence of\nsuch a trajectory necessitates at least one unstable eigenvalue at (0, 0, minil), and at least\none stable eigenvalue at (1,0, 1).\nStandard linear-stability analysis of equations (5) and (6) in (A\\ N', M)-space (see, for\nexample, Murray, 1989; Edelstein-Keshet, 1988) reveals that the eigenvalues at (0, 0, minil)\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 269\nare\nC\u00b1y\/C2~ 4Z3(;M,ni,)Qf(\/Mini|)\n2D(\/7,mil)\nSince c and D are positive at least one eigenvalue is positive, as required. If some eigen-\nvalues are complex, however, then locally oscillatory solutions imply that N(z) < 0 for\nsome z, which is biologically inadmissible. Thus, the eigenvalues must be real, giving the\nfollowing minimum wave-speed condition:\n1ni[)a('\"init)- (7)\nAt (1, 0, 1), there is one real positive and two real negative eigenvalues for all values of c,\nwhich does not impose further constraints on the wave speed. Thus, travelling-wave solu-\ntions may exist for any wave speed greater than cmin given in (7). In Section 6, we assess\nwhether the theoretical minimum wave speed, cm,n, is observed in numerical simulations.\nWe also investigate the effects of haptotaxis (coefficient \/ ) ; the nonlinear haptotactic term\nis absent from the expression for cmn because condition (7) is derived from linear analysis\n(above).\n4.2 Perturbation approximations\nHaving established the possible existence of travelling-wave solutions with a speed boun-\nded below by Cmin, we now use perturbation theory to study the form of the wave solutions.\nThe aim of this subsection is to determine the way in which features such as the peak in the\nendothelial-cell density and the slope of the ECM wave depend on the model parameters.\nMathematically, our approach is motivated by the dependence of the waveforms on the\nsmall parameter \u20ac in the numerical simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Recall that the size\nof e reflects slow rates of ECM synthesis and degradation.\nThe leading order (e = 0) approximation to equations (6) and (7) implies that M' = 0,\nand hence that M{z) is constant. This fails to satisfy the boundary conditions that M \u2014>\nWjnit as z -*\u2022 \u2014oo and that M -*\u2022 1 as z -*\u2022 oo, however, so the perturbation e > 0 is\nsingular.\nFigure 1 (and similar numerical simulations) reveals that as e decreases the domain\nof influence, which is defined formally in the legend to Fig. 2, of the dynamics increases\nbehind the wave. This suggests that in the waveback, z can be rescaled so that the domain\nof influence is invariant in the f -domain, where \u00a3 = \u00a3?(e)z and Q is a positive increasing\nfunction of e which is to be determined. By quantifying how the domain of influence\ndepends on \u20ac in numerical simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 2 we can deduce that Q ~ e,\nso that an appropriate transformation in the waveback is f = ez', that is, the width of the\nECM wavefront is inversely proportional to the rate of ECM dynamics. We will now use\nthis rescaling to determine the qualitative form of the waves, by considering the solution\nseparately in the wavefront and the waveback, and then matching these two solution parts\nusing standard techniques.\n4.2.1 Wavefront approximation. In the wavefront, the nontransformed equation (7) im-\nplies that M(z) = mini, to lowest order, using the boundary condition far ahead of the wave.\nL. O L S E N E T A L .\nFIG. 2. (a) Numerical measurements of Q for different values of e. The parameter e reflects the rate of ECM\nkinetics (synthesis and degradation by cells), and is consequently small, while f2~' represents the width of the\nwave of the ECM density m associated with vascular ingrowth. For a fixed e, the spatial domain of influence,\nQ~x, is defined as the difference JTO9 \u2014 *04. as illustrated in (b), where xs is determined by m{xs, I) = s, at\nsome given time t which remains fixed throughout these simulations. The profiles of n and m given in Fig. 1\nconfirm that values of m between 0.4 and 0.9 lie wholly within the waveback. By plotting Q against e, it is\nevident that i? and e are approximately proportional. Note that the protracted spatial domain \u201410^x< 1.2 was\nused to accurately calculate Q and that the wave speed was independent of e in these numerical experiments, so\nthat measuring Q in terms of x instead of z is valid (t was kept fixed throughout). The calculation presented in\nthis figure motivated our choice of scaling in the perturbation analysis.\nEquation (6) then simplifies to\ncN' = D(minh)N\" + [a(minit) - (8)\nwhich is the Fisher equation (Fisher, 1937), whose travelling-wave behaviour has been\nextremely well studied (Murray, 1989).\n4.2.2 Waveback approximation. In the waveback, the equations are expressed in terms\nof \u00a3 via the transformation \u00a3 = ez (as discussed above), leading to\nfrom equation (6) and to\n\u2014 = (1 - M)a(M)\/p\nd?\nfrom equation (7). Using the functional form u(M) = a0M\/(K^ + M2), this ordinary\ndifferential equation can be solved implicitly to give\nIn M - -M)-M= aotf -\nwhere \u00a30 is an arbitrary constant of integration to be determined by matching the solutions\nin the two portions of the domain (see below). Note that the boundary conditions M - \u2022 1\nand N \u2014> 1 as | \u2014> oc are satisfied.\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 271\nM(z)\nFlG. 3.

Here N and M denote the waveforms for endothelial cells and ECM; z is the\ntravelling-wave coordinate. The parameter e reflects the rate of ECM kinetics, and is thus small.

Higher-order correction terms are required to\nobtain a better quantitative fit.\n4.2.3 Lowest-order matching. Denoting the lowest-order wavefront approximations by\n7Vf(z) and M{(z), and similarly, \/Vb(\u00a3) and Mb(%) for the waveback, we can match the two\nsolutions at some point in the wave profile by continuity at that point; that is, Nf = Nb and\nM( = Mb.

Because the domain is contracted only in the waveback (that is, the domain\ntransformation is one sided), this composite solution is only valid in the waveback. The\nwavefront solutions are simply N{(z) and Mf(z), in the nontransformed domain.\nThese lowest-order approximations are compared with numerical solutions of the model\nequations (3) and (4) in Fig. 3, for two values of \u20ac. The accuracy of these approximations\nimproves when e is smaller, as expected. In addition to its role as an approximation, the\nperturbation approach also yields insight into the structure of the travelling-wave solutions;\nfor example, (at least) for small e, the cell density in the waveback is closely related to the\nform of the cell proliferation term, a{m).\n5. Two-dimensional simulations\nSo far, we have assumed that wound angiogenesis occurs in one spatial dimension, with\ncells and the ECM propagating towards the wound centre. In practice, however, a signifi-\ncant component of dermal healing proceeds from the base of the wound towards the upper\nsurface. Subdermal tissues contain a well-developed blood-vessel network, and it is be-\nlieved that a large proportion of new capillaries originate from this source during wound\nangiogenesis.\nHere, a two-dimensional (2D) analogue of the model is formulated for wounds with\na rectangular cross section, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Numerical simulations are presented\nbelow, focusing on the effects of quantitatively different boundary conditions and of wound\ngeometries.\n5.1 The model\nThe 2D versions of equations (3) and (4) are\n\u2014 + V \u2022 \u00a3 = [a{m) - fin}\" =\nat\n(12)\n1.0\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS\nn(x,y, 2)\n273\n0.5 i.o \" 0\nn(x,y,\\0) ( )\n1.0\nFIG. 5.

The similarity\nwith the ID-model simulations is most evident from the solution profiles along the x = 0\nand y = 0 axes, where the system effectively mimics the ID model (due in part to the\nboundary conditions). The numerically observed wave speed is within a couple of per cent\nof the theoretical minimum, as given by the inequality in equation (7), for the simulations\nshown in Fig. 5. The zone of (significant) interference between the two waves moving in\nthe x- and y-directions lies within a narrow region situated around the line y = x. Here,\nthere is a small relative increase in n and a decrease in m compared to the ID solutions.\nThe quantitative dependence of the numerical solutions as the ECM kinetics parameter \u20ac\nvaries is analogous to that in ID.\nThus far, the subdermal cell and ECM densities have been taken as being equal to those\nin the dermis, which may be inaccurate. Numerical simulations reveal that away from the\nwound base (y = yb) the effects of using different subdermal boundary values (rib and nib)\nare negligible. Near this boundary, however, there is a sharp jump in m and a smooth, albeit\nfairly local, transition in n (not shown). This is expected because cell fluxes are present in\nthe model but the ECM has no flux; see equations (12) and (13).\nFinally, we consider a quantitatively different wound geometry, in which the wound\nis wider than it is deep, by setting yb < 1. This is a more realistic representation of a\ntypical excisional wound, which may be a few centimetres wide with the thickness of the\nskin being a few millimetres. In this case, numerical simulations of the 2D model show\nthat the wave moving in the y-direction from the wound base reaches the wound surface\nbefore the wave moving in the x-direction from the adjacent dermis has reached the wound\ncentre (not shown). These simulations also suggest that the wave speed does not depend on\nthe depth\/breadth ratio of rectangular cross-section wounds and that the two orthogonally\npropagating waves only interact within a narrow neighbourhood of the line y = x. This\nspecific prediction of the effects of wound geometry could be directly tested by experiment.\n6.

The\nrelationships between the theoretical value c^n and the wave speeds observed in the nu-\nmerical simulations of equations (3) and (4) are demonstrated in Fig. 6, together with the\ndependence of the wave speed on x > 0. These results indicate that:\n(i) numerical solutions evolve into travelling waves with speeds which converge towards\nthe predicted minimum, cmn, over a long time scale;\n(ii) the effect of haptotaxis (x > 0) is to slow down the evolution towards a travelling-wave\nsolution with speed c^n-\nFinally, if x is sufficiently large, then instability quickly develops in the numerical simula-\ntions (not shown). This is typical of reaction-diffusion-taxis systems (Hofer et al., 1995;\nJager & Luckhaus, 1992; Keller & Segel, 1970; Othmer & Stevens, 1997), and it is also\nexpected in the numerical solutions of this model (see the Appendix).\n7. Summary\nFollowing a biological overview of the roles and regulators of wound-healing angiogen-\nesis, and an outline of recent mathematical modelling work which has focused on\n276 L. OLSEN ET AL.\nsoluble regulators of angiogenesis (Section 1), we developed a new continuum model for\nthe endothelial-cell-ECM interactions involved in wound angiogenesis (Section 2).\nThe model consists of two coupled partial differential equations, for the endothelial-cell\ndensity and the ECM density, and it was shown that it simulated the fundamental spa-\ntiotemporal phenomena of wound angiogenesis (Section 3). In particular, travelling waves\nof cells and ECM propagate in towards the wound centre, with a front of proliferating\nendothelial cells invading the wound space ahead of ECM deposition behind the front. A\nminimum wave speed was deduced by linear-stability analysis which depended critically\non the cell haptokinesis and proliferation terms (Section 4.1).\nNumerical simulations suggest that the solution profiles exhibit a spatially elongated\nstructure in the waveback. This observation, together with a slow-ECM-dynamics assump-\ntion, underlies the approximation analysis of the travelling-wave equations which offer\nanalytical insight into the form of the cell and ECM wave profiles (Section 4.2).\nSince many clinical dermal wounds are rectangular in cross section (including the small\ndead space in incisional wounds), the extension of the model to two space dimensions\npermitted a more realistic representation of the wound geometry and of the boundary con-\nditions (Section 5.1). Numerical simulations of the 2D model showed that angiogenesis\noccurs by the cells and the ECM moving inwards from both the wound margins and the\nwound base, the dominant effect being determined by the ratio of the wound depth to the\nbreadth. The properties of the angiogenic process, both parallel and perpendicular to the\nplane of the skin, are very similar to those for the ID case, except within a narrow zone of\ninterference between the orthogonally propagating waves of cells and ECM (Section 5.2).\nFinally, the effects of the haptotactic flux were investigated numerically, since the trav-\nelling-wave analysis did not account for this nonlinear term. It was shown that haptotaxis\ntransiently slows the evolution of travelling waves, as is intuitively expected in this model\n(Section 6).\n8. Discussion\nThe primary motivation for this work and related research lies in the scope for develop-\ning practical clinical treatments for both mediating wound angiogenesis and for inhibiting\ntumour angiogenesis\u2014since solid tumours cannot become malignant without angiogen-\nesis (Folkman & Shing, 1992; Gasparini, 1995). Recently, Chaplain and colleagues have\nproposed nonlinear partial-differential-equation models to delineate the mechanisms of\ngrowth-factor-driven tumour angiogenesis (Byrne & Chaplain, 1995; Chaplain & Stuart,\n1991b). This work adopted a similar modelling framework to ours, focusing instead on\nthe key interactions between capillary endothelial cells and their solid-state collagenous\nextracellular matrix substrate during wound-healing angiogenesis.\nOne important aspect of endothelial-cell biology that has not been explicitly addressed\nhere is activation states. Cellular activation is an early angiogenic process in which cells are\nstimulated to migrate and proliferate\u2014later, as angiogenesis ceases, the endothelial cells\nbecome quiescent and they are organized as the stable constituents of new blood capillaries\n(Clark, 1993; Whalen & Zetter, 1992). The model framework presented in this work could\nbe extended to include two cellular variables, representing active and inactive endothelial\ncells. Chaplain and colleagues include this feature in their models of biochemically me-\ndiated tumour angiogenesis. In our framework for ECM-mediated angiogenesis, however,\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 277\nthe explicit modelling of active and quiescent cell phenotypes does not substantially affect\nthe qualitative model predictions (the details were omitted for brevity). This is because the\nbiological processes incorporated within the model account for ECM-induced cell activa-\ntion, since cells neither proliferate nor migrate in the absence of the ECM and there is also\ndensity inhibition of these processes.\nThe roles of the cell-movement terms in the model, namely, the haptokinetic (unbiased)\nand haptotactic (biased, up ECM gradients) fluxes, are important. This model suggests that\nthe ECM regulation of haptokinesis is the key effect, since the angiogenic wave speed (Sec-\ntion 4.1) and waveform (Section 4.2) depend crucially on the unbiased cell movement coef-\nficient D(m), but not on the directed motion (haptotactic) coefficient x(m)- Rather, hapto-\ntaxis effectively reduces the numerically observed wave speed by a relatively small amount,\nand then only transiently (Section 6). Although there is no in vivo evidence that haptotaxis\nspecifically facilitates wound-healing angiogenesis, it is perhaps counter-intuitive that hap-\ntotaxis should elicit cell movement away from the wound centre, thereby decelerating the\nangiogenic process. This model prediction could be tested by a suitable in vitro study. An\nappropriate framework has in fact already been developed by Ingber & Folkman (1989b),\nalthough it was actually used to study cytokine control of angiogenesis. The basic proce-\ndure is to absorb ECM proteins into plastic dishes, and to plate capillary endothelial cells\nonto these substrata. This technique could easily be amended to give initial configurations\ngenerating waves of endothelial-cell density. This would lead to a greater understanding of\nthe primary mechanisms of cellular migration into healing wounds. The long-term goal of\nsuch research is of course the improved treatment of clinical wounds.\nThe model framework proposed in this paper may be enhanced to include a haptotaxis-\ndriven endothelial-cell invasive process. Specifically, we have neglected the fibrin\/fibro-\nnectin-rich provisional matrix, which is prominent during the early stages of wound-healing\nangiogenesis (McDonald, 1988; Peacock, 1984). Fibronectin is an adhesive protein which\nmay be an important mediator of cellular migration into the wound site (Kurkinen et ai,\n1980; McCarthy et al, 1988; Repesh et al, 1982; Herrick et ai, 1993), and its inclusion\nin an enlarged model may provide further insights into the process of vascular ingrowth.\nAnother natural extension of the model would be to address the structure of the vascula-\nture laid down by wound angiogenesis. Under optimal conditions, tight-skin species (man\nand pigs) create a remarkably ordered vascular stucture (Arnold etal., 1995). A number of\nresearch groups are currently developing methods for modelling orientation within connec-\ntive tissue, and incorporating these methods into our model would enable mechanisms of\nvascular order (and its control) to be predicted. Finally, we should emphasise that cytokine\ncontrol is undoubtedly a vital regulatory process in angiogenesis, which we have delib-\nerately excluded in order to focus on ECM interactions. A comprehensive model would\nhave to include cytokine regulation, building on the considerable existing experimental\ndata (Ingber & Folkman, 1989b; Le & Bertolami, 1997).\nSuch extensions provide a route to the development of detailed models focusing on spe-\ncific aspects of wound angiogenesis. However, even the simple model we have presented\nhas important biological implications, and a number of experimentally testable predictions\nhave been made which have direct clinical relevance.\n278 L.

The\nmethod used to obtain approximations to these solutions is based on the popular Crank-\nNicholson semi-implicit finite-difference scheme (Crank & Nicholson, 1947), which uses\ncentral difference approximations for the spatial derivatives and both forward (explicit)\nand backward (implicit) differences (in equal proportions) for the temporal derivatives (for\nfurther details see Morton & Mayers, 1994, Ch. 2).\nWe use uniform spatial and temporal grids, and denote by \u00abf and m* the solutions at\nspace point x-, and time step t^. Equation (4) for m is discretized explicitly:\nFor equation (3), central difference formulae are applied (at each time step) to the hap-\ntokinetic (unbiased) flux term:\n(A*)2\nwhere mi+i = \u00b1(m, + mi+]) etc. Similarly, for the haptotactic (biased) flux term:\ni) X\\ i-\\) i-\\ \\ i I - I3 \/ dm\\\n-r- I X(m)n\u2014 (*,-,dx \\ dx ) (Ax)2\nAs discussed above, our semi-implicit method uses the above approximations to the spatial\nderivatives at times tk and tk+\\ in equal proportions. The cell kinetics, \/ , are evaluated\nwholly explicitly, to avoid generating nonlinear equations for n*+l.\nA standard iterative elimination method (the Thomas algorithm) is used to solve the\nresulting tridiagonal system of difference equations for n, at each time step, subject to\nn = 1 at the final mesh point, and zero-flux boundary conditions at i = 0 (see Morton &\nMayers, 1994, for further details). If x(\"0 = 0, the Thomas algorithm is always stable,\nbut, more generally, stability imposes the following conditions (the derivations are omitted\nfor brevity):\n. f 2D(m) 1\nAx < min { . . . .\u2014\u2014- \\ , At < mm(*\u2022<> I x(m)\\dm\/dx\\ J u.o I \\d\/dx[x(m)dm\/dx]\\\nA MODEL FOR ECM-MEDIATED WOUND ANGIOGENESIS 279\nThe second of these two conditions is required only if (d\/dx) [x(m)dm\/dx] < 0 anywhere\nin the domain.\nThese stability conditions reinforce the intuitively expected and commonly observed\nphenomenon that the ratio of directional to random-movement coefficients, that is, x\/D> >s\ncrucial to the stability of numerical schemes for equations for the form (3). Intuitively, such\ninstability arises because the form of the equation changes from predominantly parabolic to\npredominantly hyperbolic. It should also be noted that directed-motion terms can result in\nfinite-time 'blow-up' in parabolic partial differential equations (see, for example, Jager &\nLuckhaus, 1992). Thus blow-up can potentially arise from the differential equation itself,\nas well as being an artefact of the numerical discretization.\nA.2 ADI method (2D)\nWe extend our numerical scheme to two spatial dimensions using the alternating-direction\nimplicit (ADI) method. Thus, we discretize the domain in both the x- and the y-directions\nand in time using uniform grids, and divide each time step into two halves. In the first half,\nthe spatial derivatives are evaluating explicitly in time in the *-direction and implicitly in\nthe j-direction, and in the second half of the time step these directions are reversed. This\nstandard technique preserves the increased stability from a semi-implicit method, while\nalso retaining a tridiagonal system of linear equations to be solved at each time step (for\nfurther details of ADI methods, see Morton & Mayers, 1994, Ch. 3).\nREFERENCES\nALBERTS, B., BRAY, D., LEWIS, J., RAFF, M, ROBERTS, K., & WATSON, J.
