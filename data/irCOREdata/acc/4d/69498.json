INTRODUCTION \nIn agricultural catchments, the export of microbial contaminants from diffuse sources \noccurs when bacteria, protozoa and viruses are mobilised from locations within or \nupon soil, and then transported to watercourses. This potential for microbial pollution \nof surface waters is exacerbated within farmed catchments (Wither et al., 2005a; \nPickup et al., 2005; Crowther et al., 2003; Crowther et al., 2002; Crowther et al., \n2001; Kay et al., 1999) largely as a result of the recycling of livestock excreta to land \neither by grazing animals or applications of organic manures. The ramifications are \nthat agricultural practices have the potential to contaminate surface waters with \nenteric micro-organisms, a proportion of which may be pathogenic to humans. Thus, \nwater-borne illness and the associated ease of transmission of a variety of pathogenic \nmicro-organisms via watercourses remain of significant importance despite the \npotential risks associated with land applied livestock manures having been recognized \nfor more than 100 years (Gerba and Smith, 2005).  \n \nIn Europe, legislation such as the Bathing Waters Directive (76\/160\/EEC) (Anon, \n1976) has acted to drive improvements in sewage treatment, sewerage infrastructure \nand compliance with mandatory bathing water quality regulations. Similarly in the \nU.S., the microbiological quality of beach water is required to be of a safe standard as \nestablished by the USEPA. Unfortunately, non-compliance with microbial guidelines \ncan still occur at designated bathing sites, particularly after high rainfall, and this has \nbeen attributed, in part, to diffuse sources contributed from agricultural land \n(Crowther et al., 2002). In winter months or for significant summer storms, heavy \nrainfall primarily drives high water flow conditions and so the transport of fecally \nderived microbes through catchments can be of a highly episodic nature (Wilkinson et \nal., 2006) which adds to the complexity of tackling catchment scale microbial \npollution of watercourses. Diffuse pollutants sourced from farmed areas are likely to \ncome under increased scrutiny following the implementation of both the EU Water \nFramework Directive (2000\/60\/EC) (Anon, 2000) and cross compliance associated \nwith Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Furthermore, in the case of \nEuropean legislation, the Bathing Waters Directive is soon to be updated, with \nmicrobial standards set to get tougher and compliance at bathing beaches predicted to \nfall as a result (Jones, 2002).  \n \nIn a move to curb the potential increase in designated bathing waters failing to meet \nfuture mandatory standards, a cost-effective and pragmatic option is to improve \nunderstanding of farm management operations capable of (i) reducing potential \npathogen numbers in livestock excreta and  manures and (ii) reducing subsequent \ntransfer (through the environment) of fecal micro-organisms derived from livestock \nexcreta that are recycled to land. This will prove important for supporting farmer \ndecision making, devising policy and implementing mitigation practices to limit fecal \nmicro-organism delivery from land to water. Figure 1 synthesises these points in a \nbasic conceptual framework.  \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \nFigure 1: Approaches available to limit delivery of potential pathogens to receiving waters. \nRoute A represents no vigilance on the part of the farmer, any reduction is a result of \nenvironmental and microbial processes. Route B suggests land and animal management \ntechniques are employed such as fencing off water courses from grazing animals or applying \nmanures at acceptable times via appropriate application methods. Some farms may choose \nroute C and compost or process animal manures to the detriment of microbial populations. \nFarms showing a willingness to protect the environment are likely to combine benefits of both \nland and animal manure management for maximum effect (route D). An overarching \ninfluence is the decision making process embedded within individual farmers. The weight of \nthe line associated with each route denotes a simple level of relative risk of potential \ncontamination of adjacent watercourses. \n \n \n \n \nThe aims of this review are two-fold. First, to assess current measures (available to \nfarmers and landowners) capable of limiting and reducing fecal micro-organism \nnumbers within manures which accumulate on farms (i.e. targeting the source of \npathogens). Secondly, to assess proactive land management options capable of \nlimiting microbial movement from grassland soils to watercourses. As an initial \nstrategy, mitigation efforts can attempt to limit the mobilisation of fecally derived \ncontaminants once they are received by land, and a secondary option is to focus \nefforts on limiting the delivery of manure-borne microbes to a watercourse through \n\u2018disconnecting\u2019 hydrological connectivity. Mitigation efforts can therefore focus on \nsource, mobilization and delivery aspects of pathogen cycling through the \nenvironment and each of these components is dealt with in this chapter in accordance \n \nFARMER DECISION MAKING \nFARMER DECISION MAKING \nFARM\nLIVESTOCK \nMANURE \nTREATMENT\nLAND AND \nANIMAL  \nMANAGEMENT\nLIVESTOCK \nMANURE \nTREATMENT\nLAND AND \nANIMAL \nMANAGEMENT\nWATERCOURSE\nA\nB\nC\nD\n 5 \nwith a \u2018source-mobilization-delivery\u2019 concept (illustrated in Fig 2).

SOURCES OF PATHOGENS IN THE FARM ENVIRONMENT \nWithin this review the term manure will be used when describing both solid and \nliquid animal manures; slurry will refer specifically to liquid manures, and the term \nsolid manure used generically to describe cattle and pig farmyard manure (FYM) and \npoultry manure. A common misdemeanour is to perceive and to refer to such animal \nby-products as animal wastes which is misleading and instead we should recognise \nmanures to be a farm resource (Burton and Turner, 2003). Although a valuable farm \nresource, excretions from livestock can be a substantial source of pathogens to the \nenvironment; a study in the U.K. has suggested that over 30% of livestock manures \n(derived from cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry) contain at least one form of microbial \npathogen (Hutchison et al., 2004a). The survival of fecally derived micro-organisms \nwithin farm manures has been reviewed previously by Oliver et al., (2005a). \nConsequently, the following evaluation focuses upon sources of potential pathogens \ncommonly found within farms environments and agricultural land.  \n \nA. MANURES SPREAD TO LAND \n \n1. Slurry (liquid manure) \n \nSlurry is a relatively uniform mix of excrement and urine produced by housed \nlivestock and collected in a liquid form (Chadwick and Chen, 2002) with a typical dry \nmatter content ranging between 1 \u2013 10% (Pain and Menzi, 2003). Slurry may also \ncontain parlour washings, dilution water and secretions from the animal\u2019s nose, throat, \nblood, mammary gland, skin and placenta (Pell, 1997). It flows under gravity and can \nbe collected via slatted floor systems within animal housing which empty into \nreception pits. This liquid manure is then spread to land to provide replenishment of \nnutrients for plant growth. Intensification of livestock agriculture in the UK has \nfavoured the production of slurry over solid manure because of the reduced use of \nbedding materials (Strauch and Ballarini, 1994). All European member states prevent \nthe spreading of slurries within nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) during an autumn \nclosed period in an attempt to protect watercourses. In the U.S., animal feeding \noperations (AFOs) are regulated in accordance with farm size (based on \u2018animal \nunits\u2019), with larger AFOs constrained by greater regulation, based on the assumption \nthat larger operations pose a greater pollution risk (Risse et al., 2005). \n \nSlurries contain a host of microbes that are derived from the gut of farm animals and \naccommodate a more uniform microbial distribution when compared with solid \nmanure because of the greater mobility of micro-organisms in this liquid material \n(Chadwick and Chen, 2002). There is noted to be seasonal variability in pathogen \nnumbers found in slurries. As an example, higher counts of Camplyobacter have been \nrecorded in cooler winter months within stored dairy slurry on farms in Lancashire, \nUK (Stanley et al., 1998). In the UK, slurry storage often consists of above ground \ncylindrical tanks (made either of steel or concrete) or slurry lagoons and is often a \nmixture of old material and newly deposited manure. Storage capacity varies with \nfarming activity, financial investment and the amount of rain water that is able to \naccess the store. Covered slurry stores are advantageous because less precipitation is \nable to contribute to the accumulation of the liquid fraction of the slurry, limiting both \nthe amount of manure required for recycling back to land and the potential for \noverflowing. Improper sealing of all valves or a crack developing in the store wall \ncould potentially lead to water and soil contamination of extensive proportions. An \n 7 \nalternative system to slurry storage tanks are lagoons. These comprise a pit in the \nground and can be either lined with concrete or be earth walled. Similarly, lagoons are \ngenerally open to rainfall.  \n \n2. Solid manure (farmyard manure; FYM) \n \nIn contrast to slurry, solid manure cannot flow under gravity. But due to its solid form \nit is easily stacked. Specifically, FYM is made up of livestock excretions combined \nwith a bedding material (generally straw). It is common practice for broiler chickens \nto be bedded on woodshavings, thus generating broiler litter. In the short term, solid \nmanure is generally piled into heaps that accumulate within the farmyard though \nNicholson et al., (1999) suggest that only 21% of solid manure is stored permanently \non concrete in England and Wales. More often, solid manure is transferred to a field \nand stored as a field heap until spread to land. Within England and Wales, the practice \nof leaving uncovered manure heaps in fields until a more appropriate time for \napplication (Fig 3A) is common, and this method accounts for 79% of solid manure \nstorage (Nicholson et al., 1999). This acts to free up space within farmyards and can \nimprove the convenience of spreading manure at a later date. However, high intensity \nrainfall that occurs prior to spreading may provide the driving force to facilitate the \ntransfer of microbes from uncovered manure heaps to nearby watercourses. \nConsequently, careful thought needs to be given as to where to best situate field heaps \nin order to minimise the risk of water pollution. The solid fraction of the manure heap \n(Fig 3A(i)) can generate a liqueur that seeps out of the bottom of the manure pile (Fig \n3A(ii)) and this may either infiltrate slowly through the soil profile and provide a \nvehicle for vertical microbe transfer or transfer over the surface of sloping land. A \nlarge liquid fraction can be generated when manure heaps are left uncovered outside \nand so good agricultural practice would require that such heaps are not located above \nfield drains or within 10 m of a watercourse (MAFF, 1998). \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Typical examples of temporary field stores on farms in North Devon, UK. Photo A \nshows (i) an uncovered manure heap with (ii) resulting manure liquor drainage and photo B \nshows a dirty water soak-away [(i) solid and (ii) liquid fraction] (Photograph A taken by D. \nOliver, photograph B taken by C. Hodgson). \n \nA \n(i) \n(ii) \nB \n(i) \n(ii) \n \n \n 8 \n \n \n \n3. Dirty water \n \nAny form of water that has been contaminated with feces or urine may be termed \ndirty water and is generally of a dry matter consistency of less than 3 %. Dirty water \ncan accumulate following the washing down of agricultural machinery, parlour floors \nand concrete yards areas but also following the generation of runoff across hard-\nstandings used by livestock. In particular, large quantities of dirty water can \naccumulate on dairy farms in areas of high rainfall (Smith et al., 2001). Additionally, \nseepage from slurry, FYM and silage stores often drains to dirty water stores on \nfarms. Weeping wall lagoons can be used to fractionate off a liquid component of \nslurries and solid manures and this liquid fraction, containing greater nutrient and \norganic matter concentrations than dirty water, is then often pumped from a collection \ntank to a sprinkler system that distributes this liquid to land. Pathogens such as E. coli \nO157, Campylobacter and Salmonella have been reported to survive for up to 3 \nmonths in stored dirty water (Nicholson et al., 2005) highlighting that even though \nthis is a more dilute form of farm manure, it can represent an additional source of \npathogens and fecally derived microbes to agricultural land. Codes of good \nagricultural practice (CoGAP) stipulate that pollution to surface water caused by dirty \nwater can be minimised if facilities are in place to store and manage this farming by-\nproduct and if warning devices and automatic cut-offs for sprinkler devices are \nchecked and maintained (MAFF, 1998). Though sprinkler systems are a common \nmethod of distributing dirty water to land an alternative approach adopted by some \nfarmers is to accommodate a dirty water soak-away within the farm (Fig 3B). In doing \nso, dirty water is collected and then pumped from a holding lagoon to another field \nand left to soak-away through the natural filter of the soil matrix. The solid (Fig 3B(i)) \nand liquid (Fig 3B(ii)) components of the dirty water are separated during the soak-\naway process. Clearly, if combined with heavy rainfall, and if situated in a location \nwhereby surface runoff could facilitate transfer, poorly designed soak-aways represent \na significant risk to surface water quality. \n \nB. GRAZING ANIMALS \n \nAll grazing animals defecate onto pasture and their deposited feces contain large \nquantities of enteric bacteria and potentially a number of pathogenic microbes. The \nvolume of excreta deposited to pasture varies with animal type, size and age. Typical \nvolumes of excreta voided by a 550 kg dairy cow, 500 kg beef cow, 180 kg beef \nbullock, 65 kg mature sheep and 35 kg lamb are estimated to be 53, 32, 13, 4.1 and \n1.1 litres day-1, respectively (MAFF, 1998). Pasture that becomes contaminated with \nfeces from grazing animals may facilitate the spread of a pathogen throughout \nuninfected animals should other grazers ingest microbes from the sward (Judge et al., \n2005). Thelin and Gifford (1983) and Avery et al. (2004b) have suggested that fecal \ndeposits appear to provide a protective niche for the long term survival of indigenous \nbacteria and the physical crusting of feces can contribute to the lengthy persistence of \nsome bacteria outside the animal gut. Grazing rejection patches which result from a \nhigher sward height around deposited dung on grazing fields (Bao et al., 1998; \nNorman and Green, 1958) can increase the shade surrounding feces and may bring \n 9 \nsome relief from the detrimental effects of UV radiation to potentially prolong \nbacterial survival on pasture (Meays et al., 2005). \n \nWhile cattle, both dairy and beef, are considered important reservoirs of pathogenic E. \ncoli, a comparative study identified that for fresh manures from cattle and sheep, E. \ncoli O157 had an incidence of 13.2% and 20.9% within bovine and ovine manure, \nrespectively (Hutchison et al., 2004b). The same study identified that within fresh \nmanures, sheep were found to accommodate a higher incidence of Salmonella, \nCampylobacter, Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia intestinalis than cattle \n(Hutchison et al., 2004b). In sheep, Cryptosporidium has been identified as having an \nincreasingly important role in neonatal diarrhoea syndrome and is currently associated \nwith high morbidity rates for these animals (de Graaf et al., 1999). While farmers can \ntake steps to limit this occurrence by using pre- lambing vaccinations, this may lead to \ndifferent risks associated with contamination associated with veterinary medicines \nreaching water bodies or contaminating soils. A study in Spain found that the most \nfrequent aetiologic agent involved in outbreaks of diarrhoea in lambs was C. parvum \n(65% of outbreaks and 45% of the individuals) (Munoz-Fernandez et al. 1996) and \nXiao et al. (1993) suggested that ewes were an important source of infection for \nlambs following an outbreak of diarrhoea in neonatal lambs in northern Ohio whereby \n100% of newborn lambs were affected. Similarly, colonised neonatal lambs have been \nreported to have excreted in excess of 6.5 x 107 viable Cryptosporidium oocysts per \ngram of feces in the first 10 days of birth (Svoboda et al., 1997). In contrast, a recent \nstudy has questioned the role of sheep as important zoontotic reservoirs for \nCryptosporidium and Giardia (Ryan et al., 2005) following findings that around 98% \nand 76% of Cryptosporidium and Giardia isolates, respectively, isolated in a study \nwere not known to infect humans. However, a limitation of the Ryan et al. (2005) \nresearch was that pre-weaned lambs were excluded from the study and it is \nacknowledged that C. parvum may be the most prevalent species in pre-weaned \nlambs. As a final comment, it should be recognised that livestock markets can \nfacilitate contact between infected herds and the subsequent transportation of animals \nsuggests that widespread dissemination of microbes is feasible (F\u00e8vre et al., 2006). \n \n C. MANURE SPREADING VS GRAZING AS A SOURCE \n \nIn comparing sources of fecal microbes derived from manure spreading and animal \ngrazing periods, Figure 4 shows a conceptual model that contrasts the input and \ndecline of E. coli, on pasture, for a single broadcast slurry application versus a single \ngrazing season. The profile of E. coli decline within each livestock manure type is \nsimplified but based on literature (Oliver et al., 2005b; Oliver, 2005). The initial \nnumber of E. coli on pasture is shown to be high for slurry (Fig 4; Scenario A) \nbecause the livestock manure is applied to a greater area of pasture than that covered \nby fecal deposits at time zero (i.e. the beginning of the grazing season). By contrast, \nthe grazing season (Fig 4; Scenario B) is shown to provide an accumulating E. coli \ninput to pasture via sporadic fecal deposition over a greater time-period than a single \nslurry application. Numbers of E. coli on pasture then decline following the removal \nof grazing cattle at the end of the grazing season. Clearly the \u2018risk window\u2019 available \nfor surface water contamination is more limited for a one-off manure application to \npasture than for the grazing season. In addition, the loading of land with E. coli \nderived from slurry is likely to be considerably lower if batch-stored, as opposed to \nfresh slurry is applied to land (Hutchison et al., 2005a) (see Section III.B.1). The \n 10 \nincreased \u2018risk window\u2019 for potential bacterial contamination of surface waters \nassociated with grazing is also likely to coincide with the bathing season (15th May \u2013 \n30th September) in Europe. Therefore, a summer storm that occurs several months \ninto a grazing period may have considerable impact on bacteriological quality of \nbathing water located near agricultural land at a time of critical importance in respect \nto water quality monitoring. \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Conceptual diagram highlighting potential change in E. coli numbers within slurry \napplied (A) and fresh faeces deposited (B) to pasture. The change in the potential for bacterial  \ncontamination of surface waters, given appropriate hydrological drivers (e.g. a storm event), \nis shown. The black lines depict generalised die -off curves. \n \n \n \nA drained clay loam plot experiment in Scotland found that the risk of E. coli loss \nfrom land grazed by sheep exceeded that associated with slurry applications during \nautumn \/ spring and wet summer conditions (Vinten et al., 2004a). Complementary \nfindings have been reported by Soupir et al. (2006), whereby feces deposited on \npasture by grazing livestock had a greater potential to contribute high bacterial \nconcentrations to watercourses than the application of liquid dairy manure. However, \nfactors such as stocking density, grazing season duration and manure application rates \nwill all play a role in determining the overall microbial pollution potential to nearby \nreceiving waters. The conceptual model shown in Figure 4, along with the two studies \ndescribed here, highlight that it is essential to focus mitigation efforts on losses from \ngrazing animals in addition to losses attributed to manure spreading. \n \n \n \n \nA \nB \nC\nh\nan\ng\ne \nin\n n\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf  \n   \n   \nE\n. c\no\nli \no\nn\n p\nas\ntu\nre\n \nHigh \nLow \nHigh \nLow \nIncreasing number of days since slurry applied to pasture \/                            \ncattle introduced to graze pasture \nEnd of \ngrazing \nseason \nPotential for E. coli transfer to surface waters \ngiven appropriate hydrological drivers \nLow  High \n 11 \nD. FARMYARDS and ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS \n \nA survey in England and Wales of 471 dairy farmers and 515 beef farmers indicated \nthat in general dairy farms generate manures in the form of 65% slurry and 35% FYM \ncompared with 80% FYM and 20% slurry upon beef farms (Smith et al., 2001). \nFarmyards may constitute a significant source of microbial pathogens, largely because \nthey are often the hub of farming activity and accommodate retention systems for \nholding the manures which are deposited within the farmyard. This is particularly \npertinent for dairy farms whereby a single dairy cow (550kg) is likely to produce 9.7 \nm3 of liquid manure over a 6 month housing period compared with 5.8 m3 from a \nsingle 500 kg beef cow (Burton and Turner, 2003). Farmyards can accommodate \nmilking parlours, housed animals and manure storage facilities and these tend to be \nstructured on hard-standings of concrete or a non porous material that can result in \nrunoff of contaminated water at a rapid rate following storm events (Edwards and \nMerrilees, 2003). The farmyard will often be host to animal movements or act to \nconfine animals in limited space, and can be used to allow daily exercise for dairy \ncows which often need to be kept close to the milking parlour (Lewis et al., 2005). \nStressful conditions associated with movement and limited space may result in high \nquantities of manures being deposited by animals (Friend, 1991). Farmyards are \nalways drained to some extent, and this may allow for direct hydrological \nconnectivity from the farmyard to a nearby watercourse. Goss et al. (1994a) claimed \nthat in Canada, ammonia and bacteria contributions to watercourses are of lesser \nconcern than phosphorus (P), because their release from storage facilities could be \ncontrolled by appropriate management practices. Clearly then, poor management of \nstored manures and animals confined within the farmyard will result in a more \nsubstantial threat of environmental pollution. In the US, AFOs are a significant \npotential source of microbial pathogens, generating around 100 x more waste than \nwastewater treatment plants (Gerba and Smith, 2005), and that does not include the \nmanure produced by grazing animals. \n \nLeaking septic tanks are often regarded as potential point sources of pollution and \nthey can represent an additional source of fecal microbes that originate close to the \nfarmyard. Direct evidence has shown, using biochemical fingerprinting of fecal \nindicator bacteria, that septic systems can at times fail and then act as a potential \nsource of pathogens to surface waters (Ahmed et al., 2005).  Septic tank leakages are \nnot specific to farms though, as many rural homes would also accommodate such \ndomestic waste systems. Additionally, within catchments, other contributions to \nmicrobial loadings of watercourses are likely to arise from human sewage discharges, \nwildlife and urban drainage. \n \n \nIII. REDUCING PATHOGEN NUMBERS VIA MANURE MANAGEMENT \nManure that undergoes a thorough treatment process prior to land application can be \nan effective and safe organic fertilizer whereas those manures that are not treated \nrepresent a potential microbial hazard if combined with hydrological connectivity to a \nwatercourse. An evaluation of current methods used to promote pathogen and fecal \nmicrobe die-off in livestock manures revealed a varied selection of approaches, each \nwith associated costs and benefits. Techniques range from simple and cheap \npragmatic approaches of manure management through to complex techniques that \nrequire high capital and running costs and which, in some cases, would require \n 12 \nexternal contractors, rather than a solitary farm, to deal with livestock manures. \nBriefly, the methods addressed in the following section include manure storage, \naeration techniques (liquid composting and solids composting), liming and the use of \nother slurry additives, oligolytic (or electrolytic) methods, pasteurisation, anaerobic \ndigestion techniques and dietary supplementation. The choice as to which treatment to \nuse, if any, is ultimately made by the farmer and is likely to be influenced by a \ncomplex range of factors which may include, for example, tradition, convenience and \nfarm economics. \n \nA. SOLID MANURES \n \n 1. Solid manure storage \n \nIn the UK, guidance is provided for the handling and storage of livestock manures via \nthe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs CoGAP for protection of \nwater (MAFF, 1998). In the UK, solid farm manures are typically stored for periods \nof 3-6 months prior to land application (Smith et al., 2000) and storage is \ncommonplace primarily because much manure is produced over winter while animals \nare housed and pasture is unavailable for grazing, but also because collected manures \ncannot be recycled to land in one application in order to achieve the greatest benefit \nfor the farmer and the land. Additionally, compliance with CoGAP would prevent the \nspreading of livestock manure to land under certain circumstances, for example, \nduring or following heavy rainfall (MAFF, 1998) \u2013 though this does not necessarily \nmean such practices are strictly adhered to by all farmers because it is often difficult \nto gauge the unpredictable nature of weather. Thus, storage of livestock manure on \nsome farms is a necessity and at the same time manures can undergo an improvement \nin their microbiological quality through potential reduction of fecal micro-organism \nnumbers as a function of time. For those farms that are unable to store manures due to \nlimited storage capacity, the alternative and sometimes more convenient option is that \nthey are forced to spread straight to land (Smith et al., 2001). In doing so the farmer \nbypasses a microbe reduction period (related to time) and spreads fresh manure \n(containing higher concentrations of faecal microbes) onto pasture.  \n \nThe observed decline in pathogen numbers in stored solid manure over time is \ndependent on management and storage conditions (Nicholson et al., 2005) but it is \ngenerally understood that the microbial population in excreta experiences \nconsiderable change during storage. Factors influencing microbial fluctuations in \nsolid manure include, for example, temperature (Hutchison et al., 2005b; \nHimathongkham et al., 1999), aeration (Forshell and Eskebo, 1993), and competing \nmicrobes (Jones et al., 1977). Storage of solid livestock manures can result in a heat \ngenerating composting processes whereas, in contrast, untreated slurries stored in \ntanks or lagoons are likely to remain at ambient temperature. However, even at low \ntemperatures, time will result in a general decline of microbes (Maule, 1999). Storage \nof solid manure heaps in locations exposed to UV (e.g. Fig 3A), such as in fields or \nfarmyards without any protective covering, are also likely to experience a more rapid \ndecline in the numbers of microbes because of the detrimental impact of sunlight. \nHowever, manure heaps may become saturated if exposed to rainfall and this can \nresult in poor conditions for facilitating effective composting of solid manure (see \nIII.A.2). Provided there is enough bedding material to allow good airflow then \nextended storage is not required for FYM and in any case, manure heaps are often left \n 13 \nin excess of 90 days due to normal farming practice and this should be sufficient for \nsignificant pathogen reduction. \n \n2. Composting \n \nComposting is an exothermic process that involves the decomposition of organic \nwastes within a warm, moist, aerobic environment via a suite of microorgansims \n(Forshell and Ekesbo, 1993) and which provides numerous advantages to manures. \nThese can include: reduced odour (Hobbs et al., 2004) and biological oxygen demand \n(BOD), reductions in manure volume (Burton and Turner, 2003) and nitrogen (N) \ncontrol (Michel et al., 2004) alongside the potential for fecal micro-organism \nreduction. Simple solid manure storage should result in composting but by using \nmanure management techniques the efficiency of this process can be enhanced. The \nefficiency of any composting system is related to a number of variables including, for \nexample, straw content, moisture content and the frequency of manure turning \n(Nicholson et al., 2000) and so not all composting is successful in (i) attaining high \ntemperatures (around 55oC) and therefore (ii) reducing fecal microbe numbers \neffectively. The inactivation of pathogens is promoted when composting reactors are \nused, equipped with adequate insulation so that walls also reach high temperatures \nand prevent the formation of areas of low temperature (Vinneras et al., 2003). \nComposting is limited by oxygen presence and so an adequate air supply is a \nprerequisite for microbes in order to decompress mass and avoid anaerobic conditions \n(Mohaibes and Heinon-Tanski, 2004). Agitation of solid manure assists in supplying \noxygen to the heap to promote successful composting. A common composting \ntechnique is termed static pile composting and involves a heap of manure being \nplaced upon a porous layer of straw or woodchips in order to maximise air \ndistribution within the manure heap. To avoid forced aeration via manual turning of \nmanure heaps it has been suggested that the use of a minimum of 2.5 kg of straw per \ncow (and day) must be used to provide a manure that can self compost (Forshell and \nEkesbo, 1993). Thermal insulation may then be achieved using a covering layer of \nmature compost or by using an amount of material large enough to achieve self \ninsulation (Finstein, 2004). An alternative to static pile composting is windrow \ncomposting whereby long rows of solid manure (approximately 3 m wide and 1.5 m \nhigh, but can vary) are periodically turned to provide aerobic conditions. An historical \nperspective of the evolution of composting technology is available (Fitzpatrick et al., \n2005).  \n \nSolids composting is able to generate much more heat than liquid composting because \nthe exothermic processes lose less heat through dissipation within the solid livestock \nmanure. Temperatures as high as 75oC have been reported during solids composting \n(Svoboda, 2003).  The composting of green waste (garden and park waste) for 3 days \nat a temperature of 55oC has been suggested to be efficient for pathogen removal \n(Jones and Martin, 2003). Tiquia et al., (1998) provide an account of windrow \ncomposting of pig manure and sawdust; the pathogen Salmonella was successfully \neradicated after temperatures of 64-67oC were reached and maintained for 2-3 weeks. \nSimilarly, windrow composting of beef cattle feedlot manure bedded with either \ncereal straw or wood chips was found to reduce total coliforms (TC) and E. coli by \nover 99.9% in only 7 days after temperatures of up to 42oC were attained (Larney et \nal., 2003). The bedding type did not affect bacterial elimination and although \ntemperature was clearly a key determinant in coliform kill, the authors speculated that \n 14 \nthe observed decline may also be a function of antagonism from aerobic heterotrophic \nbacterial populations. Other work has reported that thermophilic windrow composting \nat temperatures in excess of 55oC for a period of 15 days is sufficient to result in a \nsignificant decline of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts (Van Herk et al., 2004). \n \nSolid manures of high moisture content will not compost as efficiently as dry manures \n(Finstein, 2004; Nicholson et al., 2000). Seasonal fluctuations in temperature are \ntherefore likely to affect composting efficiency and hence manure heaps composted \nover winter months have the potential to harbour disease causing microbes for longer \nperiods. Manure composting using laboratory stored heaps (at 20oC and 37oC) \nfacilitated a log10 reduction in E. coli O157 numbers within 13.5 and 3.6 days \nrespectively (Himathongkham et al., 1999). Another study, at ambient temperatures, \nwas able to isolate E. coli O157 from small aerated bovine FYM heaps for up to 47 \ndays and for up to 4 months from small aerated ovine FYM heaps (Kudva et al., \n1998). However, because it is difficult to ascertain the heat distribution throughout \nconcentrated slurry and manure it is advised that safety margins for time be used if \ncomposting is used to destroy pathogens (Mohaibes and Heinonen-Tanski, 2004). \nNicholson et al. (2005) reported that most pathogen types were eliminated within 1 \nweek within solid manure heaps under composting conditions that reached over 55oC. \nOthers have reported that the movement of livestock bedding manure heaps from pens \nto a storage location, where temperatures are likely to rise, can prove effective for \nreduction of pathogen numbers (Hutchison et al. 2005b). This is a simple and cheap \nmethod for lowering pathogen levels in solid manure and one which reflects routine \nagricultural practice.  \n \nNot only direct effects of increased temperature contribute to the decline of potential \npathogens. In addition the composting of a material containing a high N supply is \nlikely to result in the release of free ammonia which is detrimental to micro-organism \npersistence (Finstein, 2004; Svoboda, 2003). Solid manure composting represents a \nviable approach to implement on farms in the UK and abroad due to its simplicity and \nlow running costs and capital expenditure. Even turning a manure heap only once can \nencourage aeration of the heap and can lead to large reductions in fecal microbe \nnumbers. \n \n3. Thermal processing (drying) \n \nSuccessful thermal processing of solid manure should result in moisture removal \nfrom, and volume reduction of, manures (Pain and Menzi, 2003). Part of the natural \ndrying process involves draining of \"manure tea\" (which can contain fecal bacteria) as \nthe heap becomes compressed under its own weight. Sterilization of manure can be \nachieved if conditions allow the process to work at optimal efficiency and the \ntechnique has been found to be more reliable for manures of a higher dry matter \ncontent (e.g. poultry manure). At present it is not a widely adopted approach based on \nthe grounds of cost to dry FYM (Hutchison, pers. comm.).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 \n B. LIQUID MANURES \n \n1. Slurry storage \n \nThe survival of enteric microbes and potential pathogens has been extensively \ndetailed using studies at a variety of scales. The impact of storage time of slurry on \ngeneric and pathogenic E. coli populations has been shown via batch experimentation \nby Oliver (2005) and Himathongkham et al. (1999), respectively. However, when \nscaling up to the farm management level, slurry tanks are often filled over a \ntimecourse and, as a consequence, the reduction effects of storage are negated due to \nintroduction of fresh slurry to the store which inoculates the liquid livestock manure \nwith a new supply of viable micro-organisms. This suggests that ideally a farm needs \nmore than one slurry store to prevent re-contamination of stored slurry and facilitate \nbatch storage. It is therefore worrying that a risk assessment study of 117 farms \ncarried out in two river catchments in south west Scotland identified that 21% of \nfarmers had less storage than 1 month of the farm\u2019s manure production (Aitken, \n2003). Only 29% had more than 5 months storage and over 50% of the farms were \nfound to have inadequate or unsatisfactory manure storage facilities in terms of risk of \nwater pollution incidents (Aitken, 2003). A survey of England and Wales likewise \nidentified that 23% of beef and dairy farms combined had no or minimal slurry \nstorage suggesting these farms may pose an increased risk of storage overflow (Smith \net al., 2001). \n \nThe extent of reduction via storage varies between studies. A batch experiment using \nfive different cattle slurries demonstrated that for all slurries, E. coli O157 declined \nsteadily, though at significantly different rates, but after 64 days, in most cases, E. coli \nO157 was still detectable (Avery et al., 2005). Avery et al. (2005) conducted the \nexperiments at 10oC to reflect the mean annual air and soil temperature as \nexperienced in North Wales. Work reported by Oliver (2005) showed that generic E. \ncoli declined to undetectable levels (< 130 CFU mL-1) as early as day 42, representing \na 6 log10 CFU reduction, when stored in slurry at 15oC. While it is accepted that \ngeneric E. coli, as an indicator of potential pathogen presence, must survive at least as \nwell as pathogenic strains, it is likely that the more rapid decline observed by Oliver \n(2005) in comparison with Avery et al. (2005) is governed, in part, by the higher \nexperimental temperature used. Early work of Jones et al., (1976) highlighted a rapid \nreduction in Salmonella dublin in cattle slurry during the first month of storage and \nthe rate of decline corresponded with increasing temperature. During the months June \nto December and at temperatures of generally less than 20oC, E. coli O157, \nSalmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. have been shown to survive for up to 3 \nmonths (Nicholson et al., 2005). \n \nAnother study evaluated the survival times of E. coli and Salmonella in slurry. These \nwere reported to be a maximum of 1 week and 28 weeks, respectively (Kovacs and \nTamasi, 1979). Under these experimental conditions Salmonella was observed to \npersist 7 times longer at 20oC than at 4oC. This again highlighted the role of \ntemperature dependent destruction kinetics, however, the more lengthy persistence in \nthis study was associated with a higher temperature treatment which is contradictory \nto much of the other published research. It was speculated in a recent review by \nOliver et al., (2005a), that the lower temperatures may have induced a viable but non-\nculturable (VBNC) state in the Salmonella spp. and so may have allowed for the \n 16 \nSalmonella cells to avoid detection. The VBNC state means that the microbes remain \nmetabolically active but are no longer able to grow and divide on conventional media \nand thus do not produce colonies. As a result the Salmonella count at the low \ntemperature may have been an underestimate.  \n \nIn a comparison of bacterial and protozoan pathogen die-off within slurry the \nprotozoa Cryptosporidium parvum was found to be much more robust than bacterial \ncells (Hutchison et al., 2005a). This research found that after inoculation of pathogens \ninto 35,000 L volumes of fresh livestock manure, the decimal reduction time (D-\nvalues; time for a 1 log10 drop) for bacterial pathogens ranged between 6 and 44 days \nwhereas C. parvum had a maximum D-value of 345 days. No distinct effect of \nseasonality on decline of micro-organisms under storage was observed (Hutchison et \nal., 2005a). \n \nGenerally, it is found that batch storage of livestock manures provides a useful and \nsimple strategy for reducing the enteric micro-organism content, but it is considerably \nmore expensive than standard storage because of the extra batch storage capacity \nneeded (Chambers, 2003). Storage is also beneficial because it means that manures \ncan be spread to land when the risk of surface runoff is less. However, some \nresearchers believe that long term storage is not the answer for complete destruction \nof pathogenic E. coli within manure (Avery et al., 2005). Others have suggested that \nlivestock manures, if contaminated with bacterial pathogens, should undergo storage \nduration of 6 months to reduce pathogen levels though alternative strategies should be \nexplored to reduce viable levels of protozoan pathogens (Hutchison et al., 2005a). \nThe results of a recent report similarly concluded that an extensive length of storage \n(6 months or greater) is required to reduce bacteria numbers by 99% (Svoboda, 2003). \n \nUnfortunately, storage of slurry for long periods can result in anaerobic conditions \nthat will usually give rise to offensive odours in farming environments and release \nmethane and ammonia to the atmosphere (Zanardini et al., 2002). In fact, stored \nlivestock manure derived from cattle accounts for significant (around 10% of total) \nNH3 emmisions from UK agriculture (Misselbrook et al., 2005; 2000). Furthermore, it \nhas been estimated that the cost of slurry storage may not justify fecal bacteria \nreduction by such means (Svoboda, 2003). The requirement to obtain more storage \nspace may also incur additional disadvantages. Those farms deemed to have \ninadequate storage would need to increase their storage capacity which in turn creates \na greater exposed surface area of liquid livestock manure and hence allows for \nincreased rainfall collection. As a result, this would increase the cost of slurry \ndisposal for the farmer. Finally, a worry would be that farmers could become \ncomplacent with their storage space; this may result in situations where stores \noverflow at periods where land application is not feasible (Svoboda, 2003). \n \n2. Aeration \n \nThis particular manure treatment strategy is primarily used to control odours released \nfrom slurries but it can also assist in the reduction of fecally-derived micro-organisms \n(Svoboda, 2003). Oxygen must be dissolved into slurry to provide an aerobic \nenvironment in replacement of an anaerobic system if successful aeration of liquid \nlivestock manure is to occur (Burton, 1998). The technique is also capable of \nstabilizing organic matter and converting available organic N to ammonia N. The \n 17 \nmain methods of aerating slurry are through the use of: surface aerators, bubblers, air \ninjectors, plunging jets, sparger aerators and venture (suction) aerators and these can \nvary in investment cost, aeration capacity and reliability (Burton and Turner, 2003). \nThe process of aeration in slurry tanks should result in a temperature rise but the \naccompanying rise in pH during aeration may also play a role in reducing potential \npathogen numbers. Others have commented that protozoa are aerobic microbes and \nthe aeration process may therefore promote protozoan predation of bacterial \npathogens (Heinonen-Tanski et al., 1998a). A variety of studies have examined the \nimpact of aeration on microbial populations within slurries, both in the laboratory and \nwithin farm scale slurry tanks. \n \nThermophilic aeration of cattle slurry has been shown to result in a high standard of \nhygienic quality of livestock slurry, with temperatures of up to 70oC resulting after 19 \ndays aeration at ambient temperatures of around freezing. Combining cattle slurry \nwith whey and fruit-jam waste was found to be optimal for composting (Heinonen-\nTanski et al., 2005). A period of 2 to 5 weeks brought about a > 99% reduction (and \nin some cases levels dropped below detection limits) of the initial Salmonella \npopulation within cattle slurries at the farm scale, following aeration processes \n(Heininen-Tanski et al., 1998a). In addition, numbers of fecal coliforms (FC) and \nfecal streptococci (FS) were reduced, though the impact was greater for FC. In \nanother study it was concluded that aeration of liquid slurry in farm tanks at low \ntemperatures effectively reduced levels of Yersinia, Listeria, enterococci and \ncoliphages by over 90% of the original inoculum (Heinonen-Tanski et al., 1998b). \nOthers have stated that aeration always results in a more rapid decline of bacteria \nwithin slurry (Munch et al., 1987). In terms of eliminating protozoan pathogens, \naerated cattle slurry has been reported to contain significantly reduced numbers of \nCryptosporidium parvum in contrast to unaerated slurry (Svoboda et al., 1997). \nSimilar research has investigated the impact of aeration on viruses in slurry and \ndetermined the rate of inactivation of enterovirus to be increased with aeration. A \nlog10 unit drop was observed within 2 - 4 days at 20oC in contrast to the same level of \nvirus reduction within 300 days at 5oC (Lund and Nissen, 1983). The technique can \nonly be effective provided that no fresh slurry is introduced to aerated batches. \n \nTrouble free and effective aeration of cattle slurries may first require both dilution and \nmechanical separation of the manure (Haygarth et al., 2004). Also, the conditions of \nthe final composted product may allow for the growth of some potential pathogens \nsuch as E. coli O157 and Salmonella if the composting process has been inefficient \nand organic matter remains poorly stabilised (Jones and Martin, 2003). Other \ndisadvantages of the approach include the production of foam and further details have \nbeen published on aeration oxygen transfer, mixing and foam control and aerator \nperformance (Cumby, 1987abc). This aside, aeration is a relatively simple concept \nand and can prove an effective approach, but, depending on the system used, running \ncosts and capital investment from the farmer can be  expensive when compared to \nother potential manure management strategies (e.g. intensive aeration can require very \nhigh capital costs).  \n \n3. Anaerobic digestion \n \nAnaerobic digestion is a natural process that operates in the absence of oxygen and \nwhich facilitates the decomposition and decay of organic matter. Liquid manures will \n 18 \nundergo anaerobic digestion unless artificially aerated. A more comprehensive \nevaluation of anaerobic digestion is provided by Monnet, (2003) but a short \ndescription is provided in the following. Briefly, micro-organisms are used to \ndecompose organic matter within livestock manures within a confined digester and \nthis will result in the emission of methane and CO2, hence biogas recovery systems \nare sometimes known as anaerobic digesters. The resulting digestion can increase \nreactor temperatures into mesophilic or thermophilic ranges, equivalent to 20 - 45oC \nand 55 - 70oC, respectively. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion will provide a higher \ngas yield in comparison with its mesophilic counterpart, but in turn it requires \nincreased capital investment (Nicholson et al., 2000). Anaerobic digestion has a \nvariety of benefits and under controlled conditions it can manage odour, reduce \npathogen numbers, improve nutrient manageability, breakdown organic mass, and be \na competitive alternative to lagoon systems (Moser, 1998). Subsequently, it has been \ndescribed as an holistic manure treatment solution (Wilkie, 2004). Unfortunately, the \nsystem is relatively complex and it has been reported that such treatment systems are \ngenerally only used by enthusiastic farmers, primarily because of the associated high \ncapital costs (Nicholson et al., 2000) and intensive management required; this is \nreflected in the low number of UK anaerobic systems adopted (Svoboda, 2003). \nNicholson et al. (2000) estimated that the total capital investment required for \nanaerobic digestion of cattle slurry for the whole of the UK would be in the region of \n\u00a31300 million and as such, this is not a realistic option for farms because of the costs \ninvolved. \n \nIt has been reported that the anaerobic digestion process can result in over a 2 log10 \ndecline of pathogen numbers (Moser, 1998). Mesophilic fermentation at 30oC for a \nperiod of approximately 14 days has been suggested to be sufficient to reduce \npathogen content of slurries significantly (Burton and Turner, 2003), though \nthermophilic will be prove more more efficient in reducing microbe numbers \n(Martens et al., 1998). Research investigating specifically bacterial pathogens \n(Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae) determined that \nlaboratory scale anaerobic batch digesters eliminated all of these bacteria within 5 to \n10 days at temperatures of 35oC. A fecal bacterium, indicative of potential pathogen \npresence (Streptococcus fecalis) was more robust, surviving for up to 15 days at 35oC. \nAt lower temperatures (18-25oC) all of the bacteria were able to persist for longer \nperiods; 35 days in the case of S. fecalis, 20 days for E. coli and S. typhimurium and \n10 days for S. dysenteriae (Kumar et al., 1999). Inc reasing the temperature further, \ninto a thermophilic regime, is reported to impact further on fecal bacteria destruction \ntimes during anaerobic digestion (El-Mashad et al., 2003). At a temperature of 53oC, \nE. coli and Streptococcus fecalis numbers  have been found to decline by 90% within \n0.4 and 1.0 hr, respectively (Olsen and Larsen, 1987). In contrast, a laboratory scale \ndigester experiment using mesophilic anaerobic digestion was found to initially \nreduce E. coli, S. typhimurium, Y. enterocolitica and L. monocytogenes numbers \nrapidly but a 90 % reduction for these bacteria ranged between 0.7 and 0.9 days \nduring batch digestion (Kearney et al., 1993). \n \nOthers have highlighted the ineffective role of anaerobic digestion of liquid fractions \nof flushed dairy manures due to the highly diluted nature of the waste material. This \nmay also be reflected in the greater wealth of research literature for solid rather than \nliquid manures. For example, there is a wide selection of work describing the impact \nof anaerobic digestion on fecal micro-organism numbers within biosolids (e.g. Horan \n 19 \net al., 2004; Kato et al., 2003; Sahlstrom, 2003; De Leon and Jenkins, 2002; Nielsen \nand Petersen, 2000). As a solution, researchers at the University of Florida developed \na fixed film anaerobic digestion procedure which represented a high rate anaerobic \ndigestion technology (Wilkie, 2004). Briefly, the method allows for the digestion of \nthe liquid portion of the livestock manure at ambient temperatures. The term \u2018fixed \nfilm\u2019 was derived from the use of inert media which was packed into a tank; a \nconsortia of bacteria were able to attach to this and then grow as a biofilm. As liquid \nmanure was passed through the system, the anaerobic layer of biomass broke down \norganic matter as previous ly described. \n \n4. Pasteurization \n \nPasteurization involves a heat treatment of livestock slurry that partially sterilises the \ncontent. The temperature of the slurry is raised considerably but is below boiling point \nand generally below the temperature required to denature protein. It is considered a \nhighly effective technique to eradicate potential pathogens from livestock manures \nand the method involves maintaining the manure at temperatures as high as 70oC for \n30 minutes or longer. This increase of temperature will also cause the volatilization of \nodorous slurry compounds. Widespread implementation of this technique in the UK is \nunlikely due to associated expenses in terms of both capital and running costs \n(Svoboda, 2003).  \n \n5. Oligolytic treatment \n \nLiterature describing the effectiveness of oligolytic treatment impact on fecal \nmicrobes in livestock manures is limited. In brief, oligolysis is an electrolytic \napproach that is principally used to reduce the odour of stored slurry (Zanardini et al., \n2002), particularly that derived from piggeries (Feddes et al., 1998; Ranalli et al., \n1996; Yu et al., 1991). However, it has been suggested to have other beneficial \neffects, one being pathogen removal, because of the bacteriostatic effect of copper \nions. Using this approach, small quantities of metal ions, in particular copper, are \ndissolved in slurry via electrolysis resulting in sterilisation of some microbes. \nOligolysis methods take place within storage tanks and can last several months. \n \nThis electrolytic technique works by first reducing the fermentation and\/or respiratory \nactivities of microbes present in slurry through the use of copper ions. The \nfermentation and respiratory activities of cells within slurry are limited because of an \nelectric current that impacts on cellular membrane mechanisms and adenosine 5-\ntriphosphate (ATP) synthesis (Skjelhaugen and Donantoni, 1998). A potential on-\nfarm set-up for electrolytic treatment of slurry (Fig. 5) would require a secondary \nslurry store to allow for the oligolysis phase. The provision of a secondary store will \nin itself be expensive, as discussed earlier when evaluating the benefits of manure \nstorage. \n \nSome research has shown that oligolytic treatment can result in a 2 log10 decline of \nFC and FS bacteria but this represented only a small reduction of total numbers and \nleft over 104 MPN L-1 within both pig and cattle slurry (Sorliny et al., 1990). Other \nresearch has suggested that electrolytic treatment ensures an effective pathogen kill \n(Skjelhaugen and Donantoni, 1998). However, in this study the electrolytic treatment \nfollowed on from an initial aeration procedure and this may have been influential in \n 20 \nthe reduction of pathogen numbers, though the authors do comment that the \nelectrolytic treatment reduced microbial content very quickly. Conversely, other \nreports have concluded that the approach provided unconvincing results in the \nreduction of fecal indicator organisms (FIOs) when compared with other methods of \npotential pathogen control in livestock manures (Svoboda, 2003). Complementary \nfindings were reported in another laboratory based experiment investigating the \noligolytic treatment of pig slurry. Oligolysis lasting for 91 days did not result in a \nsignificant reduction of pathogenic indicators (Colanbeen and Neukermans, 1992). \n \nOligolysis requires a high amount of initial capital to set up a farm scale system as \nshown in the schematic diagram of Figure 5. However, a basic system requires low \ninvestment and its simplicity has meant that the approach has benefited from \ncontinued interest (Burton and Turner, 2003). Currently, this potential strategy for \npathogen control still appears to be under researched in the literature and this was \nechoed in a recent expert panel survey conducted for the RELU project RES-224-25-\n0086 that found that out of 14 experts in the fields of microbiology, manure \nmanagement and contaminant transfer, only 2 were aware of its use as a mitigation \noption for reducing pathogen numbers in manures (Unpublished data). \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Schematic on-farm design of electrolytic treatment for liquid livestock manure \n \n \n \n \n \nHoused \nLivestock \nSlurry \nReception \nPit \nPrimary \nSlurry \nStorage \nTank \nSecondary \nSlurry \nStorage \nTank \nElectrolytic \nTreatment \nTypical example \nof slurry \nmanagement on \na farm \n \nSupplementary \ntreatment stage: \nRequirement of \nsecond batch \nslurry store \nCu \nElectrodes \n 21 \n6. Slurry additives and disinfectants \n \nSlurry additives are not, at present time, widely used in England and Wales \n(Nicholson et al., 2000) and evidence of their effectiveness is scarce (Burton and \nTurner, 2003). However, if it can be shown that a range of microbiological benefits \ncan arise from additions to slurries at cost effective rates then it would be \nadvantageous to administer livestock manure additives on a grander scale. Potential \nadditives include strong acids, base precipitating salts and disinfectants. Those \nsubstances likely to alter slurry pH can be expected to be effective for pathogen \nreduction. Additionally, disinfection of liquid livestock manures may be achieved via \nthe inclusion of chlorate ions to stores; nitrate reductases are known to reduce chlorate \nions to form chlorite ions which would impose a bactericidal effect on potential \nbacterial pathogen populations (Tamasi and Lantos, 1983). Commercially available \nmanure odour control agents have been investigated with respect to their ability to \nsimultaneously impact on E. coli numbers in animal manuress because some of these \nproducts claim to reduce pathogens present in swine slurry. One study evaluated ten \nodour control agents; none were effective at inhibiting or destroying E. coli when \nsupplemented at manufacturer recommended rates (Johnston et al., 2002). Upon \nmixing the agents with slurry at a ten-fold higher rate, one odour control product \n(ENVIROPUR) was able to reduce E. coli numbers to levels below detection, even at \ntemperatures as low as 4oC, and several other products reduced viable E. coli levels \nwithin the slurry following 8 days incubation (Johnston et al., 2002). Generally, it has \nbeen suggested that proprietary additives will have little impact on pathogen survival \nin slurries (McCrory and Hobbs, 2001). \n \nLime treatment of slurry can reduce the number of fecal bacteria and potential \npathogens through a simple procedure whilst simultaneously providing the added \nvalue of a liming agent to livestock manures. Calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium \nhydroxide (Ca(OH)2) are the most commonly used alkaline additives (Svoboda, 2003) \nand are capable of increasing pH up to levels of 11.5 and greater. It is reported that \nachieving a pH of 12, for a minimum of 2 hours is sufficient to result in an effective \npathogen decline (D of E, 1996). Alkaline conditions may prove detrimental for fecal \nbacteria because under such circumstances there exists increased potential for the \nbinding of heavy metals to cell membranes which may inhibit the intra-cellular \ntransfer of a variety of metabolites. The addition of lime will also result in a rise in \ntemperature of the livestock manure, which in itself is detrimental for fecal bacteria \nsurvival. Such a temperature rise will also release some odorous slurry compounds. \nProvided there is an adequate mixing of the lime agent with slurry, fecal microbes can \nbe successfully reduced in number. However, an important point to bear in mind is \nthat the use of lime as a reduction technique is only valid if the land to which slurry is \nto be applied has a sufficiently low pH and suitable buffering capabilities to \naccommodate the lime. \n \nSimilarly, acidification of slurry can reduce bacterial numbers, though E. coli O157 \nhas been reported to be more acid tolerant than other potential pathogens (Russel and \nJarvis, 2001; Benjamin and Datta, 1995). Acidic conditions help reduce bacterial \nnumbers because of the combined effects of promoting hydrogen ion absorption to \ncell walls, the inhibition of cation replacement within cells and the potential increase \nin leakage of compounds essential to normal cell function. The on farm practicalities \nassociated with acid treatment, such as management requirements, safety precautions \n 22 \nand potential corrosion of steel and concrete stores means that in reality only a \nspecialist contractor would  be able to facilitate this management option (Chambers, \n2003)   \n \nThe use of sheep dips in the form of synthetic pyrethroid (SP) insecticides within UK \nagriculture replaced organophosphate (OP) insecticides after health risks to farmers \nwere associated with the latter. As a result, SP\u2019s are now the most commonly used \nsheep dips within the UK (Semple et al., 2000). However, SP\u2019s are considerably more \ntoxic than OP\u2019s for aquatic life-forms (Virtue and Clayton, 1997) and thus sheep dip \ncontamination of watercourses can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems \n(Hooda et al., 2000). Consequently, a standard disposal strategy is to dilute the sheep \ndip with animal slurry. In doing so, Semple et al. (2000) found that when high \nconcentrations of sheep dip were diluted with the slurry a significant increase in the \nFC group, in addition to other bacteria, was observed. Lower concentrations (0.002 \u2013 \n0.02%) in contrast had little effect on microbial populations. This led the authors to \nspeculate that sheep dip may be detrimental for protozoa survival thus limiting \nprotozoan grazing on bacteria. A follow up study was able to confirm that the \npresence of sheep dip formulations in liquid livestock manures was able to reduce the \nnumber and diversity of protozoa (Boucard et al., 2004). This highlights the potential \nfor some slurry additives to increase the risk of bacterial contamination of water and \nland associated with the spreading of liquid livestock manure to pastures. \n \nC. LIVESTOCK WELFARE \n \n1. Animal health \n \nMost of the pathogens discussed thus far are harmful to humans, and not to the \nlivestock themselves. So although animals may be carriers of these bacteria and \nprotozoa, they do not necessarily show any clinical signs of illness (except in the case \nof neonatal diarrhoea). This makes it difficult to detect livestock that are carriers of \nhuman pathogens. Nonetheless, general livestock health can impact on the microbial \ncomposition of livestock feces. Understanding when livestock are susceptible for \nexcreting the highest pathogen loads would clearly aid on-farm pathogen control.  \n \nThe age, species, diet and management of livestock can impact on pathogen levels \nfound in animal manures (Burton and Turner, 2003). Animals that are exposed to \nstressful conditions are known to shed higher concentrations of bacteria in their \nexcrement (Jones, 2001; Mechie et al., 1997; Grau et al., 1969). When animals are \nover-stressed their immune system is inhibited from responding to infection in an \nefficient and effective manner (de Passille and Rushen, 2005). Inadequate animal \nhousing whereby, for example, large numbers of livestock are confined in small areas, \nis also likely to enhance the potential for animal-to-animal transfer and pose new \nhealth and environmental concerns (Fitzgerald et al. 2003). In general, high stocking \ndensities typical of intensive animal husbandry are likely to increase animal stress \nlevels which may in turn increase the shedding of pathogens and rate of re- infection. \nAs an example, a recent study concluded that high stocking density increased E. coli \nO157 shedding in beef feedlots (Sargeant et al. 2004). Enhancement of animal \nwelfare through improvements in housing could help limit disease transmission \nthrough lower microbial shedding (de Passille and Rushen, 2005).  \n \n 23 \nHeat stress may also affect fecal shedding rates; in the US, dairy farms that have \nmoved into more warm regions have subjected more cattle to higher temperatures for \nlonger durations (Fitzgerald et al., 2003). Others have claimed that a lack of animal \npreconditioning combined with long haul transport increased fecal shedding of both \ngeneric and pathogenic E. coli by calves on, and shortly after, arrival at feedlots (Bach \net al., 2004). Similar studies have identified that transportation acted to stress cattle \nand led to an increase in Salmonella spp. shed in feces (Barham et al., 2002). Shorter \ntransit times and preconditioning may potentially prove effective as management \nstrategies for minimizing pathogen shedding by calves. \n \n2. Dietary supplementation \n \nPerhaps a more complex management option is to manipulate the pathogen content of \nlivestock excrement before it is produced. This can be achieved by manipulation of \nanimal diet because of the subsequent alteration of the structure and functions of the \ngastrointestinal tract (Buddington and Weiher, 1999). There is evidence that pathogen \nnumbers within excrement can be reduced via the supplementation of livestock diet \n(e.g. Braden et al., 2004; Schamberger et al., 2004). For example, animals fed prior to \nharvest with an ascophyllum nodosum dietary supplementation experienced a lower \nprevalence of enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157 (Braden et al., 2004). A recent review \nprovides a comprehensive account of options available for control of \nenterohaemorrhagic E. coli in ruminants and discusses the use of antibodies, \nprobiotics, fasting and farm management practices (Stevens et al., 2002). However, in \nconclusion the authors suggest that it is debateable as to whether such strategies can \nimpact on the shedding rates of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli sufficiently in order to \nminimize the risk to human health because of the low dose required to cause infection \nin humans. \n \nIt has been proposed that the introduction of novel forages into agricultural swards \ncan reduce potential pathogen numbers in the animal gut by releasing antimicrobial \nproducts on ingestion (Davies et al., 2001). The use of sodium chlorate as a \nsupplement to cattle diet is claimed to reduce E. coli O157 populations in cattle and \nbe a viable strategy to limit pathogen input to land and livestock manure stores \n(Callaway et al., 2002). The authors highlight that such a supplementation also \nreduced generic E. coli numbers and in the case of their study, E. coli declined by 2 \norders of magnitude in the rumen. By supplementing drinking water with sodium \nchlorate for 24 hours all strains of E. coli O157 were reduced by approximately 2 \nlog10 cells in the rumen and 3 log10 cells in feces. The reduction in cell numbers \noccurred because facultative anaerobic bacteria such as E. coli, which are able to \nanaerobically respire on nitrate through reduction to nitrite, also co-metabolically \nreduce chlorate to cytotoxic chlorite when exposed to chlorate. Chlorate is only \nbactericidal against nitrate-reductase-positive bacteria (Callaway et al., 2002) and \nthus represents a potential strategy to curtail E. coli populations in livestock prior to \nexcretion. Olson et al. (1998) reported that allicin-based products administered to \nneonatal calves infected with Cryptosporidium parvum did not alter the duration of C. \nparvum induced diarrhoea shedding. However, intensive prophylactic administration \nof the same product was proposed as being able to delay diarrhoea in calves exposed \nto C. parvum which is also the most frequent aetiologic agent involved in outbreaks of \ndiarrhoea in lambs (Munoz-Fernandez et al. 1996). Colicinogenic E. coli additions to \ncattle feed are an alternative strategy for reducing fecally shed E. coli O157 \n 24 \n(Schamberger et al., 2004). Colicins are antimicrobial proteins and so these bacteria \nare used as a probiotic. Schamberger et al. (2004) found that feed supplementation of \nthis type resulted in a reduction of 1.1 log10 CFU g-1 feces and that a daily \nadministration of 108 CFU of colicin E7 producing E. coli to every gram of feed had \nthe potential to limit fecal shedding of this pathogenic E. coli strain. \n \nOther studies have investigated the survival of E. coli O157 in slurry from cattle fed \ndifferent diets. As an example, over a ten week slurry storage period, E. coli O157 \nwas observed to decline in number by 3.5 and 5.5 log10 CFU within slurry derived \nfrom cattle fed a silage and silage plus concentrate diet, respectively (McGee et al., \n2001). Furthermore, a change of diet from grain- to hay-based diet has been proposed \nas a option to lower the number (and acid resistance) of E. coli within cattle (Diez-\nGonzalez, 1998). This is important because acid tolerant E. coli are more likely to \nsurvive in the human stomach; if the strain is pathogenic then it may lead to an \nincreased potential of infection of the human host if the bacteria can withstand the \nacid environment (Couzin, 1998). \n \nHowever, in the long term, probiotic or dietary ways of controlling potential \npathogens may not prove to be consistent and it is likely that farm\/land management \nmay also be required to complement such measures. The reason for this is that \nsurvival studies in soil, water and manures consistently suggest that outside the host \nanimal, fecal microbes do not survive well. Land\/farm management strategies could \nfocus on (i) making the outside environment as un-conducive as possible to survival \nor (ii) prolonging the residence time of those microbes in the environment that exist in \nthe farm.  \n \n \n \nIV. LAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO LIMIT PATHOGEN \nTRANSFER FROM LAND TO WATER \nPathogen transfers from land to water can occur through a range of soil hydrological \npathways (Oliver et al., 2005a). A key factor governing the transport of microbes \nfrom land is high intensity rainfall (Oliver et al., 2005b) but clearly human activity is \nunable to regulate this driver. In response, there are a variety of methods aimed at \nlimiting micro-organism movement and delivery to watercourses and these are \nevaluated on a case by case basis in the following. It is critical, however, to emphasize \nthat for optimal mitigation of microbial contamination of watercourses there is a need \nto develop an holistic and integrated catchment management approach to support \nsustainable solutions by using strategies that complement one another. \n \nA. MEASURES TO REDUCE PATHOGEN MOBILIZATION FROM \nLAND \n \n1. Manure application techniques \n \nThe discussion in section II identified that spreading of livestock manures to pasture \ncould introduce a source of pathogens to land which may subsequently be transferred \nthrough and across the soil when coupled with hydrological drivers such as rainfall. \nFor consideration of how to effectively limit any potential movement in an attempt to \nprotect watercourses from microbial delivery following manure application, attention \n 25 \nmust be given to the timing and rates of application and to the variety of manure \napplication methods at the farmer\u2019s disposal. In the UK, Defra funded the production \nof a series of summary booklets for managing livestock manures, one of which \nprovided valuable information with respect to spreading systems for slurries and solid \nmanures (Chambers et al., 2001). \n \nApplication methods for liquid manures include broadcast (splash plate), band, \ntrailing hose and injection techniques. Briefly, broadcast spreading uses pressure to \nforce slurry from the tanker onto an inclined \u2018splash plate\u2019 resulting in a widely \ndistributed topical application of manure to land. Band spreading provides close \napplication to land in the form of narrow bands via a series of hoses connected to a \nboom at the rear of a slurry tanker. The trailing shoe option is similar to band \nspreading, except that the shoe attached to each hose facilitates slurry deposition \nunder the sward canopy. Finally, injection methods literally inject slurry under the soil \nsurface \u2013 either by means of a shallow or deep injection. For grassland, shallow \ninjectors are used that are able to incorporate slurry to a depth of less than 0.1 m from \nthe soil surface (Rodhe and Etana, 2005). The most common solid manure spreading \ntechniques are side discharge spreading and rear discharge spreading. Ploughing land \nfollowing manure spreading effectively incorporates the manure into the soil and can \nbe adopted when reseeding grassland. \n \nRapid, or incidental, transfers of contaminants can occur following rainfall coupled \nwith ill timed manure applications (Preedy et al., 2001) and this can represent a \nsignificant source of bacterial pollution for surface waters (Ramos et al., 2006). \nManures (and associated microbes) applied via broadcast techniques without \nincorporation are likely to be more readily mobilized by surface runoff than those \ninjected or ploughed into the soil because they are less well protected from \ndetachment mechanisms associated with (i) impacting rain drops and (ii) resulting \nsurface runoff processes (Quinton et al., 2003).  While the shallow injection and \ntrailing shoe techniques deliver liquid manures in bands under the sward cover and \ntherefore protect the slurry components from rainfall, some studies have found that \nthere is an increased risk of bacteriological contamination of tile drains following \ninjection rather than broadcast spreading (King et al., 1994; Foran and Dean, 1993; \nDean and Foran, 1992). \n \nThe advice provided to farmers in terms of the best preventative spreading methods to \nlimit microbial contamination is complicated further because of impacts on microbe \nsurvival associated with these different spreading methods. Deep injection and \nploughing of manures into the soil may be seen as a strategy to aid the protection of \nwatercourses from rapid overland transfers of manures and manure-associated \nbacteria and protozoa through prohibiting lateral movement, but a direct consequence \nof incorporation with the soil is that the microbes, such as E. coli O157, persist for \nlonger periods than they would on the soil surface (Avery et al., 2004a). Similarly, \nHutchison et al. (2004b) showed that the rate of pathogen decline was governed by \nthe amount of time contaminated manures remained on the soil surface and that \nmicrobe viability increased when incorporated with the soil. This may have arisen \nbecause the surface injected \/ ploughed cells were protected from desiccation effects \nassociated with UV radiation, known to be effective for pathogen kill (Hijnen et al., \n2006; Meays et al., 2005), but additionally, the soil environment can provide \nprotective micro-niches for microbes (England et al., 1993). However, the \n 26 \nincorporated location within the soil does not guarantee that the microbe will stay on \nland; water movement through soil may then facilitate a slower vertical microbial \ntransfer through the soil matrix or rapid passage through bypass pathways \n(macropores) which may potentially deliver the cells to a watercourse, providing the \nmicrobes are not filtered and trapped within the soil profile. So as a counter argument \nit may be construed that broadcast spreading is the preferred option to protect \nwatercourses from microbial pollution because it allows for a more rapid elimination \nof microbes through desiccation and UV radiation, effectively removing the pathogen \nsource and preventing microbial contamination. It would, however, be imperative that \nthe manure application be well timed to avoid an immediate rainfall event following \napplication; this is dependent upon the vigilance of the farmer (see Section IV.A.2). \n \nAs a final consideration, there must be appreciation that microbial contaminants are \nnot the only environmental concern associated with spreading manures to land. \nIncorporation techniques are seen as efficient methods to reduce ammonia emissions \nand nuisance odours following spreading periods (Misselbrook et al., 2002; Moseley \net al., 1998; Malgeryd, 1998). Broadcast applications may allow for rapid microbial \ndie-off but do not necessarily benefit other pollution issues, and if coupled with a \nrainfall event, broadcast spreading can be disastrous for water quality if a watercourse \nis in close proximity to the land to which the manure has been applied.  \n \n2. Farmer environmental stewardship \n \nFarmer vigilance can undoubtedly complement even the most effective mitigation \nefforts. There are a variety of simple options that can be adopted that are proven to \noffer some means of watercourse protection from contaminants derived from \nlivestock manures. The key to such vigilance essentially lies in the maintenance of \nfields and farmyards. Simple and often cheap measures can include grazing fields \nlocated away from watercourses, separation and diversion of clean water from roofs \naway from dirty areas of the farmyard, the repair of guttering to facilitate such \nseparation and the relocation of gateways to avoid likely runoff pathways. \n \nInterestingly, a simulation study for the River Irvine catchment in Scotland identified \nthat catchment mitigation approaches may be more beneficial for the microbial \nquality of bathing water at Irvine Beach than simply reducing stocking density of \nanimals (Vinten et al., 2004b). However, reduced stocking densities will result in less \nexcreta per unit area and this has to be considered as a potential strategy to limit fecal \nloading of pasture, though in balance it is also associated with additional economic \ncosts because the farmer will be required to either increase the area of farmed land or \nreduce animal numbers. Removal of animals from pasture prior to rainfall events is \nprobably of little benefit to water quality because pasture will have already been \ncontaminated with excrement and work has reported the importance of the legacy of \nfecal material on pasture in terms of microbial impact on receiving waters even after \nthe removal of cattle (Oliver et al., 2005b). In addition, the relocation of cattle may \nimpact pasture by creating rapid overland flow pathways from the continually \ntrampled and poached ground as livestock are herded from field to field thus \neliminating any benefit of moving the cattle in the first instance. Knowing that \nbacterial transfer from land to water occurs, an alternative strategy is to remove \nlivestock from susceptible and vulnerable areas of pasture. By mapping such \nvulnerable areas of pasture (see Section IV.B.4) there may exist the potential to limit \n 27 \nmicrobial loading of receiving waters by (i) avoiding overland flow pathways and \nsteep slopes and (ii) including natural vegetation buffers or constructed wetlands as \ncomplementary mitigation strategies.  \n \nA crucial aspect to consider in relation to manure spreading rather than animal \nmanagement is the timing of manure applications to land \u2013 which, if done carefully \nand according to CoGAP (MAFF, 1998), can be extremely effective. This is because \nthere is an increased likelihood for bacterial contamination of receiving waters if a \nrain event occurs soon after slurry application (Ramos et al., 2006). The farmer \ndecision making process ultimately determines when manures are spread to land at \nparticular times throughout the agricultural calendar. Limiting the impacts of a \nmanure application on water quality can be addressed by vigilance on the part of the \nfarmer. However, the practicalities are not always straight forward if storage space is \ninsufficient and farmers are forced to apply manure to land (Aitken, 2003). Earlier in \nthe paper, Section II suggested that batch storage of manure is beneficial for the \nmicrobial composition of slurry and solid manure, but it does not prove convenient if \nstorage space is limited. In fact, limited storage space can in some cases dictate \napplication timings. A proportion (up to 16%) of dairy farms in the UK have \ninsufficient (less than 1 month) storage capacity and therefore the spreading of \nmanure to land almost 365 days a year becomes a necessity (Smith et al.,  2001). \nOther factors may also govern farmer\u2019s decisions, such as family tradition and the \nfirmness of the ground to be able to take farm machinery onto pasture in the first \ninstance. \n \nIn considering farmyard management strategies, McGechan and Wu (1998) raise an \ninteresting modelling scenario when discussing slurry storage options for impacts on \nthe environment and farm economics. They adopt two slurry store size options for \ntheir simulations, each reflecting a differing farmer attitude to the manure. It follows \nthat a farmer who opts for a small slurry store may consider the slurry to be an \nembarrassing \u2018waste\u2019 requiring disposal, which will often take place when the store \nhas reached capacity and on fields in closest proximity to the store. In contrast, the \nauthors state that farmers opting for larger slurry stores may represent farmers who \nconsider slurry to be a beneficial \u2018resource\u2019 that can be exploited for their economical \ngain. The logic behind this is that the slurry can be stored and spread at the optimum \ntime for nutrient uptake by crops so therefore increased storage provides increased \nflexibility for land application.  \n \nA final farmyard management strategy is associated with roof and gutter maintenance. \nRoofing can constitute a source of non-point water pollution and this will vary with \nthe roofing material, age and slope (Chang et al., 2004). Clean water can transfer from \nroofing and mix with farmyard washings thus increasing the volume of dirty water \nsourced from the hard standings. Separation of clean roof water (via guttering) from \nfarmyard areas contaminated with feces will help in reducing dirty water runoff from \nfarmyard areas. \u2018The 4 point plan\u2019 (4 point plan, 2002) published in Scotland is an \nexample of literature distributed to farmers that is aimed, in part, at increasing \nawareness of how to minimise dirty water accumulation around farmyards via straight \nforward advice.  \n \n \n \n 28 \nB. MEASURES TO REDUCE PATHOGEN DELIVERY TO WATER \n \n1. Restricting livestock access to streams  \n \nEstablishing a minimum distance from a watercourse at which animals can graze and \nthus fencing off such areas is a potential strategy designed to limit run-off of \nexcrement from nearby pasture and prevent direct cattle access to streams. Fencing \noff of watercourses can therefore prevent the direct deposition of fecal material into a \nstream. However, fencing alone cannot guarantee a reduction in pollutant loading to \nthe stream because even fenced fields pose a risk of contributing contamination form \noverland flow and subsurface drainage contributions to water (Byers et al, 2005; \nOliver et al., 2005b; Signor et al, 2005). Any grazed fields that are fenced off from \nwatercourses must then be coupled with the provision of an alternative water source \nfor livestock to drink. It has been reported that it is increasingly unlikely that there \nwill be direct impact on microbial pollution of watercourses caused by animal \ndefecation into surface waters because of farmers attempting to provide animals with \ndrinking water away from rivers and streams (Sheffield et al., 1997). These authors \nfound that the provision of water troughs away from a stream drew cattle away from \nthe watercourse for drinking 92% of the time, therefore reducing FC concentrations in \nreceiving streams by up to 51%. While this has been shown to reduce E. coli \ncontamination of watercourses (Byers et al., 2005) other argue that the effect of an \noff-stream water source does not satisfactorily prove effective at reducing pollutant \nloads to water (Line et al., 2003), presumably because excrement can deposited in \nhigh concentrations around off-stream drinking areas (White et al., 2001) and this \nmay be mobilised following rainfall. Additionally, cattle will often use streams for \nloafing in warm weather and so the stream does not only represent a source of \ndrinking water but also a cooling agent during summer months and this will act to \nfurther complicate widespread uptake of fenced waterways. Clearly, allowing cattle to \ndrink from a stream is cheaper for the farmer than having to provide alternative water \nsources, shaded areas and fencing, but it is less sustainable for microbial water \nquality. The provision of small bridges to allow animal crossings from field to field \nrather than through streams will also restrict cattle loafing in watercourses but again \nrequires monetary input from a farmer in contrast to cost- free stream fording.  \n \n2. Vegetated buffer strips  (VBS) \n \nVegetated buffer strips (VBS) are designed to reduce surface flow and their use is \nwidely recognised as a management option to protect watercourses from sediment and \nparticulate phosphorus derived from agricultural land (Hickley and Doran, 2004; \nAbu-Zreig et al., 2004; Abu-Zreig et al., 2003; Ferguson et al., 2003; Abu-Zreig, \n2001; Magette et al., 1989). VBS may also prove effective for removing unwanted \nbacteria from surface runoff, prior to their delivery to receiving waters from both land \nreceiving manures and grazed pasture. In the UK, CoGAP recommends that a 10 m \nbuffer be used between manure spreading and a watercourse (MAFF, 1998). \nHowever, such an approach is only effective when subsurface pathways of microbial \ntransfer, such as tile drainage, are unimportant. A basic model of the microbial \nefficiency of VBS is given in Equation 1: \n \n   Tr = Mi \u2013 Mo\/Mi      (1) \n \n 29 \nwhere Tr is the trapping efficiency of the VBS and Mi and Mo are the total number of \nfecal micro-organisms in the inflow and outflow, respectively. A number of studies \nhave reported the varying capacity of VBS to trap microbes in runoff and in general \nsuccessful filter strips are required to promote infiltration, dilution and sedimentation. \nTypically, VBS offer optimal efficiency when runoff depth is shallow. A simplified \nsummary of VBS efficiency is shown in Figure 6.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30 \nScenario Description Rainfall event (i) of  \nintensity X mm hr-1 \nfalls onto fecally \ncontaminated pasture \ngenerating overland \nflow of A mm depth \n \nRainfall event (ii) of  \nintensity 2X mm hr-1 \nfalls onto fecally \ncontaminated pasture \ngenerating overland \nflow of 2A mm depth \n \n1 \nNo Buffer in place \n \n \nNo buffer is used to \nprotect watercourse \nfrom wash-in of \nfecal bacteria \napplied or \ndeposited onto \npasture of slope \nangle Zo \n \n \nFecal micro-organisms \ndetected in watercourse \n \n \nIncreased number of fecal \nmicro-organisms detected \nin watercourse relative to \nrainfall event (i) \n2 \nBuffer Strip y \n  \n \nBuffer strip of y \nmetres is used to \nprotect watercourse \nadjacent to pasture \nof slope angle Zo \n \n \nReduced number of fecal \nmicro-organisms are \ndetected in watercourse \nrelative to Scenario 1 \n \n \nIncreased number of fecal \nmicro-organisms detected \nin watercourse relative to \nrainfall event (i) \n3 \nBuffer Strip 2*y \n \n \nBuffer strip of (2*y) \nmetres is used to \nprotect watercourse \nadjacent to pasture \nof slope angle Zo \n \nReduced number of fecal \nmicro-organisms are \ndetected relative to \nScenario 2  \n \nIncreased number of fecal \nmicro-organisms detected \nin watercourse relative to \nrainfall event (i) \n4 \nBuffer Strip y \n \n \nBuffer strip of y \nmetres is used to \nprotect watercourse \nadjacent to pasture \nof slope angle \n(1.5*Z)o \n \nIncreased number of fecal \nmicro-organisms are \ndetected relative to \nScenario 2  \n \n \nIncreased number of fecal \nmicro-organisms detected \nin watercourse relative to \nrainfall event (i) \n \nFigure 6: Basic matrix to illustrate buffer strip efficiency for reducing fecal microbe delivery \nto watercourses. \n \n \n \n 31 \nProtozoan pathogen attenuation via VBS have been evaluated by Atwill et al. (2002) \nand Tate et al. (2004) among others. Buffers constructed with silty clay or loam or at \nlower bulk densities were most successful at filtering the oocysts, in contrast to sandy \nloams and higher bulk density soils. It was proposed that under certain rainfall and \nslope conditions, a metre of VBS can produce a 0.9 to 2.0 log10 mean reduction in C. \nParvum oocyst flux relative to the total oocyst load applied in a fecal matrix (Tate et \nal., 2004). Atwill et al., (2002) concluded that vegetated buffer strips of slope < 20%, \nsoil bulk density of 0.6 to1.7 g cm-3 and of 3 m width should result in a 3 log10 \nreduction of C. parvum oocysts from overland flow that is generated from rainfall \nevents of < 4 cm h-1. In another study, a comparison of vegetated and non-vegetated \nsurfaces was made to evaluate the impact on overland and near surface transport of C. \nparvum using tilted soil chambers with bare ground and in contrast with brome \nvegetation (Trask et al., 2004). Similar to other research, vegetation was found to \neffectively filter protozoa from surface runoff. Under high intensity rainfall (63.5 mm \nh-1), up to 59% of oocysts were recovered in surface runoff from the bare soil surface \nin contrast to a maximum of 27% from the vegetated surface. In conclusion vegetation \nwas proposed as viable management strategy to reduce pathogenic protozoa being \ndelivered to surface waters because of oocyst entrapment within vegetation, \nadsorption to plant material and infiltration into the soil profile (Trask et al., 2004).  \n \nResearch which evaluated the impact of the distance of bovine manure from a \ncollection point to demonstrate the efficacy of VBS in reducing FC bacteria within \noverland flow found that a vegetated strip of 0.61 m between feces and stream would \nreduce the number of FC entering the stream by 83% in contrast to direct deposition \nof the fecal matter into the water (Larsen et al., 1994). Increasing the vegetated strip \nto 2.1 m increased this reduction of FC by a further 12%. Tate et al. (2006) observed \nsimilar findings of increased cell attenuation associated with increased buffer width. \nThey reported that, relative to a 0.1 m buffer, each additional metre of vegetative \nbuffer can result in a 0.3-3.1 log10 reduction of E. coli discharge for the range of \nslope, rainfall and runoff conditions investigated. Similarities in FC and phosphorus \ntransfer through short VBS under saturated conditions have been found, leading some \nto believe that there is potential to evaluate buffer strip performance based on the \nmore substantive volume of literature associated with P mitigation using vegetated \nstrips (Stout et al., 2005). \n \nA small scale plot experiment (2.4 x 30.5 m) whereby the upper 12.2 m of each plot \nreceived manure application and the lower 18.3 m acted as a VBS was undertaken by \nLim et al., (1998). Runoff water was sampled at various filter lengths and \nconcentrations of FC bacteria were reduced from 2 x 105 FC mL-1 to undetectable \nlevels following runoff passage through 6.1 m of filter strip (Lim et al., 1998). Field \nexperimentation in New Zealand has found that  sloping (8o) grass buffer strips (5 m \nlong, 2 m wide) provided minimal entrapment of E. coli and Campylobacter under \nhigh flow events but that under low water application rates entrapment could exceed \n95% of the applied cells (Collins et al., 2004). It was proposed that during large \nrunoff events, a 5 m length of buffer strip would be required to significantly limit \ndelivery of fecal bacteria to receiving waters. Others have found that the effect of \nbuffer width on E. coli discharge was partly dependent on total runoff volumes (Tate \net al., 2006). Interestingly, remobilisation of trapped microbes was also investigated \nusing a subsequent rainfall event after a 5 day interlude and cells were observed to be \nwashed out in the order of 2-3 times lower than recorded at the end of the experiment.  \n 32 \n \nIneffectiveness of VBS with respect to limiting fecal bacteria transfer has also been \nreported (Coyne et al., 1995) leading to debate over the usefulness of such abatement \nstrategies. While 99% of sediment in runoff was retained by 9 m long grass filter \nstrips, only 74% and 43% of FC were trapped in the two plots studied. Coyne et al. \n(1995) commented that this was an inadequate filtering efficiency for the protection of \nreceiving waters in accordance with US primary water contact standards, especially \nfollowing heavy rain and surface runoff. Similarly, Fajardo et al. (2001) concluded \nthat VBS were ineffective at coliform reduction in surface runoff despite other \npublished work supporting significant attenuation of fecal cells in vegetative buffers \n(Tate et al., 2006). \n \nThere are some concerns that VBS  may only function effectively for a limited period \nand that they may even become a source of agricultural contaminants as opposed to \nfunctioning as sinks all year round (Osborne and Kovacic, 1993). In response, some \nresearchers have stated that prudent management of vegetation within buffer systems \nis required, in addition to careful installation and design, to achieve optimal benefits \nfor both the environment and public health (Tate et al., 2006; Atwill et al., 2002; \nBarling and Moore, 1994). \n \n3. Riparian buffer strips  (RBS) \n \nRiparian buffer strips (RBS) are seen as a crucial link between agricultural land and \nthe river corridor (Anbumozhi et al., 2005). In some situations, the reduction of \ndiffuse agricultural pollutants being delivered to receiving waters, carried by surface \nrunoff, can be attributed to RBS because of their natural filtering capability of the \ndense vegetation which can trap fecal matter and reduce the momentum of surface \nrunoff. This management technique is often recommended as a tool for removing \ndiffuse pollutants from agricultural areas (Anbumozhi et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2003). \nAs an example, to protect shellfisheries from fecal bacteria in North Carolina, riparian \nbuffer restoration was recommended as a viable management strategy to implement \nalongside wetlands and education (White et al., 2000). Modelled scenario analysis has \nbeen employed to suggest a potential reduction (in the range of 3 - 82%; median 35%) \nof E. coli concentrations in stream waters of the Upper Managaotama catchment, \nWhatawhata, following the restriction of cattle access to the stream and riparian \nretirement (Collins and Rutherford, 2004).  \n \nIn Georgia, on a grassed area of Tifton loamy sand with an adjacent riparian forest of \nslash pine on a loamy sand, riparian filter strips (30 m long) comprised of 10 m grass \nand 20 m forest prevented a surface-flow wastewater pulse moving beyond 7.5 m in \ndry seasons but in wet weather the surface flow pulse was able to reach 30 m (Entry et \nal., 2000a). Stream bank engineering as part of the Lake Champlain Basin Program \nopted to include riparian restoration as part of the devised management strategy to \nreduce P, sediment and bacterial loads entering the water and as part of a combined \nmitigation effort (coupled with riparian fencing and protected stream crossings) a \nsignificant decline in bacterial counts in the watershed were observed (Meals, 2001). \nVegetation in RBS has also been investigated with respect to coliform bacteria \nsurvival (Entry et al., 2000b). Following application of animal manure to the RBS, \ncoliform bacteria declined to background levels after 3 to 4 months, though the \nbacteria declined 10 fold every 1 to 2 weeks, irrespective of seasonality effects. In \n 33 \ngeneral, higher numbers of FC  remained in the upper soil profile (0-5 cm). Given that \nshade can facilitate improved survival of bacteria contained within fecal deposits it is \npossible that riparian zones allow bacteria such as E. coli to survive longer than if \nfeces is deposited on open grassland (Meays et al., 2005). It is therefore important to \nfence off riparian areas not only to prevent cattle poaching, but also to restrict feces \nbeing deposited in the riparian area where it remains protected from UV and available \nfor wash-off into adjacent water. If we also consider that the habitat of a riparian zone \nis likely to be home to a variety of wildlife that can contribute feces and associated \nbacteria to the vegetation and soil, then even with fencing to protect the riparian zone, \nwild animals can potentially contaminate the area which is intended to protect the \nwatercourse from fecally derived bacteria.  \n \nEcological engineering aspects of riparian buffer design are discussed by Anbumozhi \net al. (2005). Briefly, they note that a time lag will occur between the planting of \nriparian zone trees and the mature functioning of this buffer for pollutant removal. \nClearly, combining a riparian buffer with grass filter stretches and shrubs will allow \nfor additional filtering until trees are fully grown. Other factors such as maintenance \nand bank stabilisation are also crucial aspects to consider in the design of effective \nriparian buffers. The topography of the land surrounding RBS clearly needs \naccounting for as steep slopes dropping to buffers are less likely to function with \nfunction efficiently. Alongside maintenance there still remains the issue of \npracticality; in many instances farmed land is a valuable asset and the use of land to \nprovide a 20 m riparian buffer may be met with some opposition on economic \ngrounds from farmers. As concluded by Collins and Rutherford (2004), the extent of \nthe efficiency of such a management tool for protecting neighbouring watercourses \nremains highly uncertain and this can be attributed, in part, to our incomplete \nunderstanding of how fecal microbes actually transfer (freely suspended or \nparticulate-associated) through the environment once released from fecal matter. It \nhas also been suggested that it is not wise to focus primarily on RBS as an \u2018end-of-\nthe-line\u2019 strategy for limiting microbial loading of watercourses (Edwards and \nMerrilees, 2003) and instead the coupling of several mitigation approaches within an \nintegrated catchment management strategy may offer improved protection. \n \n4. Land management engineering and vulnerability mapping \n \nA variety of studies have identified that overland flow can facilitate the transfer of \nmicro-organisms from land to water (e.g. Collins et al., 2005). In response, limiting \noverland flow may act to reduce (though not eliminate) the delivery of fecal microbes \nto receiving waters. While there exist a range of methods to reduce such transfers, \nmany of which are evaluated in this paper, there is also an option to engineer the land \nin a way that benefits both the environment and its users, in a form of proactive \nintervention (Quinn and Hewett, 2003). \n \nThe advent of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and recent technological \ndevelopments have accelerated and dramatically improved visual modelling \napproaches to land management. Hydrological flow paths in agricultural \nenvironments can now be mapped with the aid of computer programmes linked with \ndigital elevation and digital terrain models (DEMs and DTMs). Consequently, high \nresolution digital terrain analysis can be used to highlight zones likely to generate \nrunoff within farmed landscapes. Figure 7 shows the ArcGIS hillshade output of a 5 \n 34 \nm DTM (NextMap Britain) for a small area of the Taw catchment in North Devon, \nUK. A farm boundary is shown on the map via a solid black line. Even with a basic \noutput as shown in Figure 7 it is possible to make sensible predictions of where \noverland flow may potentially develop within this example farm environment \nfollowing rainfall.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7: ArcGIS hillshade image of a farm in the UK which can assist the identification of \ntopography and likely flow paths for overland flow. It can be combined with other datasets to \nhelp screen for land considered more \u2018risky\u2019 for contributing contaminants from land to \nwater. Solid black line represents the farm boundary \n \n \n \nAn example of a software tool developed for studying runoff processes at the farm \nscale is TopManage, which is basically a hydrological \/ topographical toolkit (Hewett \nand Quinn, 2003). Briefly, TopManage allows for the representation of local micro-\ntopography allowing visualisation of likely runoff zones and enabling a simulation of \nhow manmade features such as tyre tracks from machinery, hedgerows and concrete \nroads may accelerate or decelerate farm runoff. This can then allow the user to make \nan informed assessment on the likely impact of such features on water flow from \nfarmed land. TopManage can therefore be used as an integral part of a runoff \nmanagement plan. More recently, Heathwaite et al. (2005) have discussed modelling \nand managing critical source areas (CSA\u2019s) using flow connectivity simulation \nthrough combining CSA\u2019s and flow accumulation models. This helped to identify the \n200 m \nN \n 35 \nimportance of tramlines, tracks and field drains in concentrating flow towards \nreceiving waters. Lane et al., (2004) discussed flow connectivity modelling in terms \nof a network index approach. They suggest that for hydrological connectivity from a \nsaturated zone to a watercourse to occur, then all DEM cells between that saturated \nzone and the drainage network must become saturated. Within such models \nassumptions can be made with respect to flow direction of runoff based on contours \nderived from the base DEM. If a contaminant of concern is known to be transported \nby surface runoff processes, then being able to predict the location of surface \ngenerated flow can be an important landscape screening tool. Discussions relating to \nthe importance of DEM spatial resolution in generating model outputs are provided by \nAbedini et al., (2006) and Brazier et al. (2005). \n \nAn appreciation that complete field characterisation cannot be facilitated through GIS \nmodelling alone is essential. To obtain a more representative understanding we \nrequire a combination of field visits, farmer interviews and nationally available \ndatasets at different spatial resolutions to allow for spatially distributed assessments of \nthe risk of surface runoff in the environment. If these options are coupled with the \nassumption that surface water flows will also act as a carrier for microbial \ncontaminants, the risk of land contributing microbes to water can be gauged in \nrelative terms thus allowing prioritisation of sites for land management (e.g. Lane et \nal., in press). DEMs are clearly important tools and when coupled with hydrological \nknowledge and agronomic information (often obtained from farmers) they offer a \nvaluable insight into potential effective management and control of runoff from land. \nIf such landscape engineering can be employed to disconnect flow then the \nimplications are that entrained contaminants will also be disconnected from surface \nwaters. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n5. Constructed wetlands  \n \nA constructed wetland is a biological system engineered to imitate the conditions of a \nnatural wetland and used in the amelioration of wastewater (Nuttall, et al. 1997). \nConstructed wetlands, or reed beds, are an effective, environmentally passive way to \ntreat effluents and wastewaters of various degrees of potency with relatively low \ncapital and operating costs and minimal maintenance (Collings and Phillips, 2001). \nThey are seen as part of the sustainable development approach to waste management, \noffering both a low environmental impact and an appropriate ecological option \n(Hodgson, et al., 2002). \n \nConstructed wetlands are categorised into two main groups; free water surface \ntreatment wetlands (FWS) and subsurface flow treatment wetlands (SSF). In the FWS \nsystem the wetland has a water depth up to 0.6 m with the water surface open to the \nair. Vegetation and micro-organisms grow in the wetland and act to ameliorate the \nwastewater, which is often delivered as a constant stream. In this type of reed bed, \neffluent passes over the support medium, between the macrophyte stems and through \nany surface litter. In the SSF system the reed bed resembles a percolating filter except \nit accommodates aquatic plants. The wastewater is introduced in such a way as to \ncover the surface of the bed and percolate down through the plant rhizospheres and \nsupporting media. By intermittent dosing of the wastewater on to the reed bed \nsufficient aeration of the support media is maintained to avoid anoxic conditions.   \n 36 \n \nConstructed wetlands are now considered as fundamental requirements in the design \nof non-mains sewage treatment systems (Grant et al. 2000). The application of \ndifferent plant species alongside various designs of macrophyte systems has been the \nfocus of research, with the parameters that constitute the consent standards \n(Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total \nSuspended Solids (TSS) and nitrates and phosphates) receiving most attention \n(Turner, 1995; Nuttall et al., 1997; McNevin et al., 2000; Perkins and Hunter, 2000; \nHunt et al., 2002).   \n \nWhere studies on constructed wetlands have been conducted there is often a lack of \ninformation regarding the frequency of sampling and the period of study (Chendorian \net al. 1998; Thurston et al. 2001; Quinonez-Diaz et al. 2001). Perkins and Hunter \n(2000) under took a study on the FWS macrophyte system, they concluded that on \naverage an order of magnitude reduction in concentration of FC and FS was observed \nbetween the inflow and outflow of the FWS system, equating to mean removal \nefficiencies of 86-94% for FC bacteria and 83-90% for FS bacteria.   \n \nStenstr\u00f6m and Carlander (2001) reported a 99.9% removal of fecal enterococci as \ncompared to 97.5% removal for FC, via constructed wetlands, in their Swedish study. \nSimilarly Kay et al. (2005) reported reductions of over 97% in the flux and \nconcentration of fecal indicator organisms FIOs to marine recreational waters by a \nnatural wetland. Kern et al. (2000) reported remova l rates for FC bacteria of 99.3% in \nthe summer and 95.8% in the winter in a constructed wetland treating dairy farm \nwastewaters.    \n \nThe mechanisms associated with the removal of bacterial indicators are attributable to \nboth biotic and abiotic factors. The biotic factors include predation, die-off and \naddition from transient and resident animals (water voles; coots; pied wagtails etc.), \nwhile the abiotic factors include sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, effluent flow \nand temperature (Reed et al. 1995; Perkins and Hunter, 2000). Clearly effluent flow \nhas a strong influence on bacterial removal, as borne out by the strong negative \ncorrelation observed between bacterial removal and effluent flow (Hodgson et al., \n2004) and so at times of high flow, bacterial removal efficiency declines (Green et al., \n1997). An explanation for this is that an essential design criterion for wetland systems \nis to provide conditions conducive to the settlement of particulate associated \npollutants. This is achieved through the presence of vegetation which impedes flow, \nthus allowing the more effective sedimentation of fine particulates (< 2 \u00b5m in size), \nwhich have a slower settling velocity (Davies et al., 2003). Recording the time \nsamples are taken may have a significant outcome on the reported removal efficiency \nof a wetland. Hodgson et al. (2004) identified a diurnal trough, in terms of removal \nefficiency, during normal flow conditions. This is perhaps typical of a sewage \ntreatment system dealing predominately with domestic wastewater. This may in part \ngo some way to explaining why so many authors report such high removal \nefficiencies for constructed wetlands (e.g. Wood and McAtamney, 1994; Kern et al., \n2000; Decamp and Warren, 2001; Quinonez-Diaz et al., 2001; Pundsack et al., 2001, \nThurston et al. 2001). In each case removal efficiencies in excess of 98.5% are \nreported however, no mention of sampling time is indicated. \n \n 37 \nThe type of planting medium (gravel or soil) can also influence the effectiveness of \nSSF wetlands in reducing coliform numbers. Decamp and Warren (2000) exemplified \nboth of these cases in a combined microcosm and pilot-scale experiment and found \nthat most E. coli removal takes place within the first 1\/3 of a system and that E. coli \ndid not decline as quickly within unplanted soil bed when compared with gravel bed \nsystems. The relationship between E. coli concentration and distance along the bed \nfollowed an exponential decline. When scaling up from a microcosm (1.25 x 0.3 x \n0.25 m) to pilot (6.0 x 2.8 x 0.6 m) study, the average E. coli removal increased by at \nleast 24%. This may be attributed to the less efficient communities developed within \nthe microcosms (Decamp and Warren, 2000). \n \n6. Farm ponds \n \nFarm ponds may be considered as a viable mitigation measure in providing a sink for \ncontaminants mobilised within surface runoff from pasture (Heathwaite et al., 2005; \nQuinn et al., 2004; Hawkins and Scholefield, 2003). In contrast, others believe that \nponds are a contaminant source within farm environments because of their \nsusceptibility to receive and harbour contaminated surface runoff and fecal droppings \n(Malaney et al., 1962). In a similar fashion to VBS, RBS and constructed wetlands, \nfarm ponds rely on retention as a mechanism to attenuate fecal microbes. Some work \nhave shown that grazing livestock on land above farm ponds can be advantageous in \nreducing the rate and number of fecal bacteria entering watercourses (Fisher et al., \n2000). In one study, stream water quality was protected because the ponds intercepted \nTC, E. coli and enterococci bacteria leaving the grazed watershed. It was found that \nthe outflow of microbes from the pond were of similar magnitude to those in surface \nwaters draining a wooded catchment (Fisher et al., 2000). Larger protozoan pathogens \ncan be removed by ponds largely because of sedimentation processes; bacteria in \ncontrast are eliminated more by the processes of UV, high pH and predation within \nthe pond environment. Pond depth can therefore prove important as it impacts directly \non the penetration of UV radiation through the water and also influences dissolved \noxygen concentrations (Von Sperling, 2005). In particular, specifically designed \nwaste stabilisation ponds are considered to be effective at removing pathogenic \nbacteria (Von Sperling, 2005). \n \nOthers oppose the value of farm ponds as mitigation options because they argue that \nponds simply create another problem whilst trying to minimise the diffuse pollution \nissue they are intended to alleviate. This may then have to be dealt with in terms of \nregulation of farm ponds in the future, yet another form of regulation for farmers to \nadhere to. Jones (2005) has stated that farm ponds are actually a rich source of \npathogens for livestock which can effectively lead to a continuous cycle of shedding \nand ingestion within the farm environment. Perhaps more worryingly, ponds also \nprovide birds with potentially pathogen contaminated water for consumption and \nbathing. Ingestion of microbes by birds may then allow for the transfer of fecally \nderived bacteria and protozoa beyond the farm boundary. A study has warned that \nmigratory species could even serve to disperse bacteria between widely separated \nlocations (Cole et al., 2005). This study also speculates that opportunities exist for \nnew health problems in wildlife populations to emerge because birds use farm ponds \nand waste lagoons and graze on pastures inhabited by cattle and other livestock. Birds \ndo not only pose a threat around farm ponds; their known potential for excretion of a \nrange of human pathogens in droppings means that congregations of birds represent a \n 38 \nsource of environmental pollution whatever their immediate surroundings (Jones, \n2005). This can further complicate our assessment of the contribution of agriculture to \nfecal loading of surface waters. \n \n \nV. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nA. CONCEPTUALISING MICROBIAL MITIGATION \n \nThe risk of microbial contamination of watercourses varies with the extent to which a \nsource of pathogens (e.g. manure) is combined with a transfer mechanism (e.g. \nrainfall and slope) and a delivery component (e.g. hydrological connectivity) to form \na continuum which facilitates successful microbial export from land to water. Should \na pathogen source be coupled with both a means of transfer and successful delivery to \na watercourse, then a potential source becomes an actual risk (Edwards and Merilees, \n2003). Conversely, without a source of microbial contaminants, it does not matter if \nrunoff is generated and hydrological connectivity to a stream exists, because no \nmicrobes will be carried in the water flow and no microbial contamination of water \nwill result. Similarly, if manure high in pathogen numbers is applied to land, but is \nlocated in a field where runoff risk is low and hydrological connectivity to a \nwatercourse is indirect and negligible (i.e. no field drains present and the field is \nlocated far from a watercourse) then again, the risk of water contamination is \nsignificantly reduced.  \n \nIn summary, integrated mitigation strategies should be able to successfully limit \nmicrobial contamination of watercourses by attempting to remove, or significantly \nreduce source, transfer or delivery components from a potentially risky agricultural \nscenario (as summarized in Figure 8) so that large source areas of fecally derived \nmicrobes do not coincide with areas prone to the generation of surface runoff or other \ntransfer processes. In more general terms, a mitigation option should aim to remove \nthe contribution of CSA\u2019s specific to the contaminant of concern. However, at the \nsame time there is a need to make an holistic assessment of any proposed mitigation \nstrategy. This review has dealt primarily with microbial contaminants but there \nremains a difficult \u2018balancing act\u2019 for farmers and land managers if they are to \nembrace successful stewardship of farmed land. The diversity of physical, biological \nand chemical characteristics associated with the growing suite of agricultural \npollutants means that while certain practices may assist in limiting microbial delivery \nto watercourses, they may in turn accelerate pollution of the environment with other \nagriculturally derived contaminants (\u2018pollution swapping\u2019). This is highlighted with \nstrategies designed to alleviate N and P diffuse pollution. Both contaminants have \ndiffering chemistry and flow pathways meaning that mitigation options are often in \nconflict and liable to compromise water quality remediation (Sharpley et al., 1998). \nRisk assessment strategies should be considered to assess the benefits of \u2018pollution \nswapping\u2019 to limit environmental impacts from grassland farming and aid design of \nholistic frameworks for designing mitigation strategies for agricultural pollutants. \n \nB.  CONCLUSIONS \n \nAgronomic perturbations arising from grassland management and human activities \ncan alter the rural landscape and contribute to temporal and spatial variability in \n 39 \npollutant loading of streams. The inherent complexity associated with heterogeneous \nlandscapes confounds the likelihood that a single management strategy will provide \ncomplete protection of receiving waters from microbial contamination. Appreciation \nthat a solitary mitigation option cannot deliver 100% effective mitigation for diffuse \nmicrobial pollution needs to remain completely transparent for land managers and it is \nonly with the coupling of different strategies alongside improved education and \nconsiderable vigilance by farmers that a more sustainable approach to limiting diffuse \nmicrobial (and, crucially, other contaminant) pollution from agriculture can be \npracticed.  An awareness that small farms can adopt simple measures and that larger, \nmore economically stable farms can accommodate more comprehensive multi-stage \nstrategies of mitigation is a fundamental foundation for designing suitable land and \nmanure management plans. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8: A conceptual flow chart depicting source, transfer and delivery stages of pathogen \ncycling through the environment. Examples of potential mitigation measures are highlighted \nas breaking the continuum that would otherwise have allowed for watercourse contamination. \n \n \nAdvances in manure management strategies continue to address the potential problem \nof diffuse bacterial pollution from an \u2018upstream\u2019 perspective, prior to land \napplication, and undoubtedly further improvements in technology will make for more \nefficient strategies of manure \u2018cleansing\u2019 in the future. However, no matter how \neffective the strategy, some microbes of concern are likely to remain available for \n \nmanure  transfer connectivity \nsuccessful \ncomposting buffer strip \nLimited \nconnectivity. \nRisk of water \ncontamination \nminimized.

Furthermore, we should also question whether it is \nacceptable for manure particles to enter receiving waters even if fecal pathogens have \nbeen removed \u2013 the answer is probably not because in reality we do not want to come \ninto contact with fecal matter, sterile or not, in potable water. This means that land \nmanagement will, and must, remain a key tool in minimizing the hydrologically \ndriven transfer of fecal matter from farmed grassland to adjacent watercourses and \nthis continues to be a challenging area of catchment science, largely because of the \ncomplexity of addressing the mitigation of sporadic episodes of overland flow. \nEssentially, the quality of our approach to land management should be reflected in the \nquality of our watercourses. However, this means that cost-effective strategies and \nland management options need to be widely adopted throughout farmed catchments in \norder to prevent other neighbouring farms jeopardizing the microbial water quality at \nthe expense of the effort of others. While management options can prove valuable, \nequally important is the need to transfer such information to the farming community, \nso that management strategies can be adopted at the farm management level in order \nto improve the bacteriological quality of water draining catchments and so that results \nof scientific studies are not wasted. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work was funded as part of project RES-224-25-0086 by the Rural Economy and \nLand Use (RELU) programme who receive financial support from the Biotechnology \nand Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Natural Environment \nResearch Council (NERC), the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Scottish Office. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \nAbedini, M.
