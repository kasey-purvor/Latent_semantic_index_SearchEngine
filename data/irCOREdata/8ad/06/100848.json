The knockout reaction cross\nsections for populating 42Si and 43P and a 184 keV \u03b3-ray observed in 43P establish that the d3\/2\nand s1\/2 proton orbits are nearly degenerate in these nuclei and that there is a substantial Z = 14\nsubshell closure separating these two orbits from the d5\/2 orbit. The increase in the inclusive two-\nproton knockout cross section from 42Si to 44S demonstrates the importance of the availability of\nvalence protons for determining the cross section. New calculations of the two-proton knockout\nreactions that include diffractive effects are presented. In addition, it is proposed that a search for\nthe d5\/2 proton strength in\n43P via a higher statistics one-proton knockout experiment could help\ndetermine the size of the Z = 14 closure.\nPACS numbers: 21.10.Pc,21.60.Cs,25.70.Hi,27.40.+z\n2\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe quest for information about shell structure in N = 28 nuclei near the neutron\ndripline is of central importance to the field of nuclear structure physics for two reasons.\nFirst, the nuclei in the vicinity of 42Si provide the first arena in which ideas about how\nchanges in the spin-orbit force affect shell structure near the neutron dripline can be tested.\nThe N = 28 shell closure is the lightest neutron shell closure caused by the spin-orbit\nforce, which is responsible for all shell closures in heavier nuclei. At present, the N = 28\nshell closure is the only major neutron shell closure driven by the spin-orbit force that\nis experimentally accessible. It has been predicted that the spin-orbit force affecting the\nneutron orbits weakens close to the neutron dripline both because of the weak binding of\nneutrons in this vicinity and the role of the continuum [1, 2]. Indeed, it has been predicted\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] that the N = 28 shell closure should be less well developed, or even collapse\naltogether, in the nuclei near 42Si. Three recent experimental results, one a measurement of\nthe lifetime of the \u03b2-decay of 42Si [10], the second the determination that 43Si is bound [11]\nand the third a mass measurement of 42Si [12] have been used to argue that the N = 28\nshell closure has narrowed or collapsed in 42Si, resulting in a well-deformed shape for this\nnucleus. On the other hand, it has been argued in Refs. [13, 14] that a possible proton\nsubshell closure at Z = 14 would have a strong effect on the structure of 42Si, preventing it\nfrom being well-deformed.\nThe second reason that experiments on nuclei near 42Si are important is that they are\nproviding a rigorous testing regime for experimental techniques that will be used heavily at\nthe next generation of radioactive beam facilities, including the Rare Isotope Accelerator.\nAmong these techniques are the intermediate-energy knockout reactions in which cross sec-\ntions provide spectroscopic information similar to that obtained for many years from direct\ntransfer reactions used at low-energy stable beam facilities [15, 16].\nIn the present article, we provide a comprehensive report of a set of measurements of\nthe N = 28 isotones 42Si, 43P and 44S using one- and two-proton knockout reactions from\nthe radioactive beam nuclei 44S and 46Ar. A brief account of this work was given in Ref.\n[17]. In addition to more detail regarding the results in [17], this article also reports: new\ncalculations of the two-proton knockout reactions that include diffractive contributions that\nwere not available prior to the publication of [17]; new shell model calculations that allow us\n3\nto refine the conclusions we draw from the two-proton knockout results regarding the nature\nof the Z = 14 shell closure; and calculations of the expected distribution of d5\/2 proton hole\nstrength in the one-proton knockout reaction spectrum of 43P.\nSection II of this article will include details of the experimental techniques and results.\nSection III will discuss the experimental results on 42Si and 44S and the theoretical calcu-\nlations on two-proton knockout reactions. In Section IV, we discuss the experimental and\ntheoretical results regarding 43P. Section V will provide a brief summary.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe present experiments were performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron\nLaboratory at Michigan State University using the Coupled Cyclotrons Facility (CCF).\nBeams of the radioactive nuclei 44S and 46Ar were produced via fragmentation of a primary\nbeam of 140 MeV\/nucleon 48Ca provided by the CCF. The primary beam was fragmented\non a 705 mg\/cm2 thick beryllium target, and the fragmentation products were separated\nin the A1900 fragment separator [18]. The separator selected secondary beams of 98.6\nMeV\/nucleon 44S and 98.1 MeV\/nucleon 46Ar. The 44S secondary beam had a momentum\nspread of \u00b11.0% and a purity of 75%; the rate of 44S particles impinging on the secondary\ntarget averaged 400 particles\/s. For the 46Ar secondary beam, the momentum spread was\n\u00b10.5% and the purity was 95%; the beam rate on the secondary target was 240,000 46Ar\nparticles\/s. Both the 44S and 46Ar secondary beam particles were identified event-by-event\nby their time-of-flight before impinging on the secondary target.\nThe knockout reactions were induced on a secondary beryllium target of thickness 375\nmg\/cm2. The residual projectile-like nuclei were detected in the S800 spectrograph [19].\nGamma-rays emitted at the secondary target location were detected using the SeGA array\nof segmented high purity germanium detectors [20] in coincidence with the residues in the\nS800 spectrograph.\nThe measurement of the residual nucleus 42Si was performed via the two-proton knockout\nreaction on the 44S secondary beam, 9Be(44S,42Si)X. The integrated secondary beam was\n1.14\u00d7108 44S particles. The 43P measurement was performed with the one-proton knockout\nreaction on the 44S secondary beam, 9Be(44S,43P)X; the integrated secondary beam for\nthis measurement was 1.1\u00d7 107 44S particles. Finally, 44S was measured via the two-proton\n4\nknockout reaction on the 46Ar secondary beam, 9Be(46Ar,44S)X with an integrated secondary\nbeam of 7.3\u00d7 109 46Ar particles.\nThe spectra from the S800 used to identify residual nuclei are shown in Fig. 1. The\nvertical axes correspond to the energy loss in the ion chamber at the focal plane of the S800,\nwhile the horizontal axis plots the path-corrected time of flight between the object point of\nthe spectrograph and the focal plane. The inclusive cross sections for production of the 42Si,\n43P and 44S residual nuclei were 0.12(2) mb, 7.6(11) mb and 0.23(2) mb, respectively. The\nmomentum distributions for these residual nuclei were within the acceptance of the S800\nspectrograph for the respective reactions and S800 settings.\nThe \u03b3-ray spectra in coincidence with the 42Si, 43P and 44S residual nuclei are shown in\nFig. 2. These spectra are Doppler-reconstructed so that they appear as in the rest frames\nof the residual nuclei. The total photopeak efficiency of the SeGA array for this experiment\nwas 5.7% at 180 keV, 2.2% at 1 MeV, and 1.3% at 2 MeV.\nThere are no discernable \u03b3-ray peaks in the 42Si spectrum.\nThe 43P spectrum includes a single large peak at 184(3) keV. No other peaks are clearly\ndiscernable, although there are background counts up to 1 MeV.\nFor 44S, the 2+1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs \u03b3-ray previously reported in Refs. [21, 22, 23] is seen clearly in our\nspectrum and we assign an energy of 1.329(10) MeV. This \u03b3-ray was first observed in the\nCoulomb excitation study of Glasmacher et al. [21], where an energy of 1.297(18) MeV was\ngiven. More recently, Sohler et al., in a report of their study of 44S via the fragmentation\nof 48Ca [22], gave an energy of 1.350(10) MeV for this transition. Finally, the report of the\nobservation of an isomer in 44S in Ref. [23] is accompanied by the report of an energy of\n1.329 MeV for the 2+1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs transition, with no experimental uncertainty given. It is likely\nthere are other \u03b3-rays in the spectrum below 1.2 MeV, but the resolving power of the present\nexperiment does not allow us to distinguish them clearly.\nIII. 42SI AND 44S\nA. Shell structure\nThe present measurement of 42Si provided two experimental conclusions: first, that the\ninclusive cross section for producing this nucleus in the two-proton knockout reaction is\n5\n0.12(2) mb, and second, that there are no discernable \u03b3-rays in the spectrum.\nThe inclusive cross section is small, smaller than any previously observed for the two-\nproton knockout reaction [16]. Bazin et al. [16] pointed out that the cross section for the\ntwo-proton knockout reaction depends on the number of valence protons, so the small cross\nsection observed here suggests that a shell closure occurs at Z = 14 where the d5\/2 proton\norbit fills. Indeed, in the N = 28 isotone 48Ca, the (d,3He) reaction [24, 25] revealed a large\ngap between the d5\/2 proton orbit and the d3\/2 and s1\/2 proton orbits (which are nearly\ndegenerate in 48Ca). The small two-proton knockout cross section provides strong evidence\nthat the Z = 14 shell gap is substantial in 42Si as well.\nWe have performed shell model calculations and reaction calculations to examine how\nneutron and proton shell structure affect the spectroscopy of 42Si and 44S. The shell model\ncalculations use the interaction of Ref. [26] with the neutrons occupying a model space\nincluding the 0f7\/2 and 1p3\/2 orbits and the protons occupying the full sd space. The two-\nnucleon amplitudes that resulted were used to calculate two-proton knockout cross sections\nwith a model that extends that described in Ref. [17] by including diffractive effects.\nB. Two-Proton Removal Calculations\nThe two-proton removal reaction from an intermediate energy neutron-rich projectile\nnucleus has recently been shown to proceed as a sudden, direct reaction process [16, 27].\nWhile the associated two-proton structures and the reaction mechanism were treated only\napproximately in Ref. [16], a far more complete calculational scheme has since been detailed\nin Ref. [27]. This dealt with that part of the two-nucleon removal cross section arising from\nthe stripping (inelastic breakup) mechanism and the theoretical approach combined fully the\ntwo-nucleon shell-model configurations and their associated spectroscopic amplitudes with\neikonal direct reaction theory. This analysis provided further evidence for the direct nature\nof the reaction mechanism in such systems. The theoretical calculations of the two-proton-\nremoval cross sections presented here follow the formalism developed in Ref. [27]. In addition,\nwe include a full calculation of the cross section contributions from the mechanism in which\none proton is absorbed (stripped) while a second is elastically dissociated (diffracted) by the\ntarget. An estimate of the (smaller) cross section due to the removal of both nucleons by\nthe elastic dissociation (diffraction) mechanism is also included, as is outlined below.\n6\nThe two knocked-out nucleons are assumed to be removed from a set of active, partially\noccupied single-particle orbitals \u03c6j with spherical quantum numbers n(\u2113j)m. The shell\nmodel wave function of the removed nucleons in the projectile ground state, relative to any\ngiven residue (or core) state f , is the sum over the contributing two-particle configurations,\n\u03a8\n(f)\nJiMi\n(1, 2) =\n\u2211\nI\u00b5\u03b1\nCJiJfI\u03b1 (I\u00b5JfMf |JiMi)[\u03c6j1 \u2297 \u03c6j2]I\u00b5 . (1)\nHere \u03b1 denotes these available configurations (j1, j2) and [\u03c6j1 \u2297 \u03c6j2] is their normalized,\nantisymmetrized wave function [27]. The C\nJiJf I\n\u03b1 are the signed two-nucleon spectroscopic\namplitudes which are calculated here using the shell model code oxbash [28].\nThe model used for the two-nucleon stripping cross section was discussed fully in [27],\nto which the reader is referred. The partial cross section to a residue final state f is the\nintegral over all projectile center-of-mass (cm) impact parameters b and average over the\ntwo-removed-nucleon wave functions\n\u03c3str =\n1\n(2Ji + 1)\n\u2211\nMi\n\u222b\ndb |Sc|\n2 \u3008\u03a8\n(f)\nJiMi\n|(1\u2212 |S1|\n2)(1\u2212 |S2|\n2)|\u03a8\n(f)\nJiMi\n\u3009 , (2)\nwhere the Si are the eikonal S-matrices [29] for the elastic scattering of the two nucleons (1,2)\nand the A-body core with the target. These are functions of their impact parameters and are\nassumed to be spin-independent. This cross section expression accounts for those events in\nwhich the residue emerges from the reaction having missed or interacted only elastically with\nthe target, as described by |Sc|\n2, and two nucleons are removed through inelastic collisions\nwith the target. This inelasticity and the associated removal of flux from the nucleon-target\nelastic channels is described by the product of the nucleon-target absorption probabilities\n(1\u2212 |Si|\n2).\nAdditional contributions to the knockout cross section, when one nucleon, say 1, is re-\nmoved in an elastic interaction with the target while the second nucleon is absorbed, enter\nthe eikonal model expression for the absorption cross section via the term\n\u03c31 =\n1\n2Ji + 1\n\u2211\nMi\n\u222b\ndb |Sc|\n2 \u3008\u03a8\n(f)\nJiMi\n||S1|\n2 (1\u2212 |S2|\n2)|\u03a8\n(f)\nJiMi\n\u3009 , (3)\nand similarly for nucleon 2. These diffraction-plus-absorption terms require further attention\nsince the cross section in Eq. (3) includes processes in which nucleon 1 remains bound to\nthe residue. These correspond to a single nucleon absorption from the projectile populating\n7\nbound states of an (A+1)-body residue. Such effects could be ignored in an analogous\ndiscussion of the nuclear breakup of Borromean nuclei, such as 11Li [30], where there are\nno two-body bound (valence) states of the core and the (non-absorbed) neutron. These\nsingle-nucleon stripping contributions are removed by projecting off bound nucleon-residue\nfinal states, by replacing\n|S1|\n2 \u2192 S\u22171 [1\u2212\n\u2211\nj\u2032\u2032m\u2032\u2032\n|\u03c6m\n\u2032\u2032\nj\u2032\u2032 )(\u03c6\nm\u2032\u2032\nj\u2032\u2032 | ]S1 , (4)\nin Eq. (3). Here the notation implies a summation over the bound eigenstates n(\u2113\u2032\u2032j\u2032\u2032)m\u2032\u2032\nof nucleon 1 and the core and we have used the (..| and |..) bra-kets to denote integration\nover the coordinates of this single nucleon. In the calculations presented we include all the\nactive single particle orbitals in this sum. We find that the \u03c31 +\u03c32 contribution to the cross\nsection is similar to \u03c3str.\nFinally, we include an estimate of the (smaller) cross section due to the removal of both\n(tightly-bound) nucleons by elastic dissociation. Our estimate makes use of the reduction\nin the cross section when a single nucleon is elastically dissociated compared to it being\nstripped, \u03c3i\/\u03c3str. We thus estimate the two-nucleon elastic breakup cross section to be\n\u03c3diff \u2248 [\u03c3i\/\u03c3str]\n2\u03c3str. Since, for the cases discussed here, and more generally, \u03c3i\/\u03c3str \u2248\n0.35\u22120.4, then \u03c3diff makes a contribution of order 6\u22128% to the two-proton removal partial\ncross sections. The theoretical two-proton removal cross sections presented are the sum of\nthese contributions, i.e. \u03c3th = \u03c3str + \u03c31 + \u03c32 + \u03c3diff .\nThe S-matrices in Eq. (2) were calculated from the core and target one-body matter\ndensities using the optical limit of Glauber\u2019s multiple scattering theory [29, 31]. A Gaussian\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) effective interaction was assumed [32] with a range of 0.5 fm. This\ncalculates residue- and nucleon-target S-matrices and corresponding reaction cross sections\nin line with measurements in the 50-100 MeV\/nucleon energy range, e.g. [33]. The strength\nof the interaction was determined, in the usual way [34], by the free pp and np cross sections\nand the real-to-imaginary ratios of the forward NN scattering amplitudes, \u03b1pp and \u03b1np. The\nlatter affect the calculation of the diffractive contributions but are of no consequence for\nthe stripping terms, that require only |Si|\n2. For the 9Be(46Ar,44S)X and 9Be(44S,42Si)X\nreaction calculations the density of 9Be was assumed to be of Gaussian form with a root\nmean squared (rms) matter radius of 2.36 fm [35]. The densities of the core nuclei, 44S and\n42Si, were taken from spherical, Skyrme (SkX interaction) Hartree-Fock calculations [36].\n8\nThese have rms matter radii of 3.45 fm and 3.44 fm, respectively.\nOur calculations suppose that the removed protons occupy the 0d5\/2, 0d3\/2 and 1s1\/2\nsd-shell orbitals. The nucleon single-particle wave functions were calculated in a Woods-\nSaxon potential well with the conventional radius and diffuseness parameters r0 = 1.25\nfm and a = 0.70 fm. The strengths of the binding potentials were adjusted to support\nbound eigenstates with half the physical ground-state to ground-state two-proton separation\nenergies. These two-proton separation energies were taken as S2p = 33.42 MeV and 40.46\nMeV for 46Ar and 44S. Also, due to these large separation energies, we did not included the\nsmall corrections to the nucleon separation energies for transitions to bound, excited final\nstates.\nFull details of the formalism for these new diffractive terms, and their application to\nseveral (test-case) sd-shell nuclei, with better-understood structures, will be presented else-\nwhere [37]. Using the full sd-shell model spectroscopy, the calculated inclusive cross sec-\ntions consistently overpredict the measured cross sections by a factor of two, requiring a\ncorresponding suppression, Rs(2N) \u2248 0.5, of the two-nucleon shell model strengths. The\nanalogous suppression effects in nucleus- induced [15, 38] and electron-induced [39] single-\nnucleon knockout reactions are now well documented, and are of order Rs(1N) \u2248 0.6 for a\nwide range of nuclei with (N,Z) asymmetries and\/or separation energies similar to those of\nthe present study.\nC. Discussion\nThe calculated inclusive two-proton knockout cross section for 42Si, using wavefunctions\ngenerated with the shell-model effective interaction of Ref. [26], is 0.32 mb, about a factor\nof three larger than the experimental value of 0.12(2) mb. However, taking into account\nthe expected Rs(2N) value of order 0.5, discussed above, there is a closer agreement with\nthe measured value. It is also worth noting that 92% of the cross section calculated for\n42Si using these parameters is located in the ground state; therefore, the contribution of the\nexcited states to the inclusive cross section measurement is likely to be small.\nAs mentioned above, the reason that the cross section is small is because of the Z = 14\nshell gap; that is, the energy gap between the d3\/2-s1\/2 pair and the d5\/2 orbit is large. We\ncan examine how the theoretical cross section depends on the size of the Z = 14 gap by\n9\nperforming several calculations in which the gap is reduced. The Ref. [26] parametrization\nsets the d3\/2\u2212d5\/2 gap as 5.9 MeV. There is an experimental reason to believe that this gap\nmay be too large - an analysis of the centroids of proton hole strength observed in 47K via\nthe 48Ca(d,3He) reaction and reported in [25] gives a d3\/2-d5\/2 gap of 4.8 MeV.\nMore calculations were performed in which this gap was reduced by 1 MeV and 3 MeV.\nIn addition, the size of the N = 28 neutron gap was also reduced by 1 MeV (from its value\nof 3.6 MeV for 42Si) to examine how this affects the cross section. In all, four calculations\nwere performed - the first with both the proton and neutron gaps at the values from Ref.\n[26]; the second with the neutron gap reduced by 1 MeV and the proton gap left at the value\nfrom Ref. [26]; the third with both the proton and neutron gaps reduced by 1 MeV from\nthe Ref. [26] values; and the fourth with the neutron gap reduced by 1 MeV from the Ref.\n[26] value and the proton gap reduced by 3 MeV from the [26] value.\nThe cross section results from the four calculations, including the Rs(2N) = 0.5 suppres-\nsion, are shown in the top panel of Fig. 3. The reduction of the neutron gap does not affect\nthe two-proton knockout cross section. Furthermore, the reduction of the proton gap by 1\nMeV does not significantly affect the cross section, either. This is not surprising since even\nwith this reduction the gap is 4.9 MeV. However, a 3 MeV reduction in the proton gap does\nresult in a significant increase in the cross section.\nThe bottom two panels of Fig. 3 show two other sets of spectroscopic results for 42Si\nfrom the four shell model calculations - the energy of the lowest 2+1 state, E(2\n+\n1 ), and\nthe reduced electromagnetic matrix element connecting the 2+1 state to the ground state,\nB(E2; 2+1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs). Of these two observables, the reduced matrix element is the more reliable\nindicator of quadrupole collectivity. Reducing the neutron gap by 1 MeV has a strong\neffect on both these observables. Adding the 1 MeV reduction of the proton gap has little\nadditional effect on E(2+1 ), but causes a significant additional increase in B(E2; 2\n+\n1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs).\nThe large (3 MeV) reduction in the proton gap from its original value of 5.9 MeV causes a\nnear-doubling in the B(E2; 2+1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs) matrix element from its value with a 1 MeV proton gap\nreduction. At this point, proton excitations are playing a large role in driving deformation.\nA calculation of the inclusive two-proton knockout cross section for 44S using shell model\nwavefunctions determined with the parameters of Ref. [26] yields a result of 0.66 mb, which\nis (as in the case of 42Si) much larger than the experimental value of 0.23(2) mb. Once again,\nthe Rs(2N) systematics lead to an expected theoretical value of around 0.33 mb, in closer\n10\nagreement with the measured value. The calculation qualitatively reproduces the increase\nin cross section from 42Si to 44S with the addition of valence protons.\nIt is reasonable to conclude from comparing the cross section data to these calculations\nthat there is a large gap at Z = 14, although these data cannot provide a quantitative\nmeasure of the size of this gap. With respect to the urgent question of whether the N = 28\ngap has narrowed from its size in 48Ca or even disappeared altogether, the present data\ncannot provide any insights. Instead, a measurement of B(E2; 2+1 \u2192 0\n+\ngs) in\n42Si would\nprovide much more information on the size of the neutron gap and, therefore, the strength\nof the orbital spitting between l = 1 and l = 3 and spin-orbit interaction on neutron orbits\nnear the neutron dripline.\nIV. 43P\nThe one-proton knockout reaction preferentially populates states that have the structure\nof a proton hole in the beam nucleus [15]. Therefore, the states in 43P populated with the\nlargest cross sections in the one-proton knockout reaction on 44S are expected to be those\nthat are single protons in the d3\/2 or s1\/2 orbits, or a single d5\/2 proton hole. In\n47K, (a\nproton hole coupled to the doubly-magic nucleus 48Ca), the centroids of the strength from\nthe d3\/2 and s1\/2 proton orbits are seen to be separated by only 300 keV [24, 25]. In the\npresent measurement of 43P, the 184 keV \u03b3-ray suggests that the strength of one of these\ntwo single-proton orbits is concentrated in the ground state with the strength of the other\norbit concentrated in an excited state at 184 keV. The d5\/2 strength is expected at higher\nexcitation energies in 43P, as discussed below.\nThe cross sections for the ground state and 184 keV state are large and therefore support\nthis picture. The inclusive cross section - which includes both the ground state and the\n184 keV state - is 7.6(11) mb. An examination of the residue-\u03b3-ray coincidences shows that\nthe 184 keV state accounts for 75 \u00b1 15% of the cross section. The combination of this\nobservation regarding the relative cross sections of the two states and calculations based on\nthe prescription given in [29, 40] provide a strong argument that the s1\/2 proton strength\nis concentrated in the ground state, while the d3\/2 strength is concentrated in the 184 keV\nstate. A shell model calculation similar to that described in section III using the Ref. [26]\nparameters (including the 5.8 MeV d3\/2 \u2212 d5\/2 proton orbit splitting), yields a cross section\n11\nof 3.7 mb for a ground state that consumes 98% of the s1\/2 strength, while a state that\nconsumes 99% of the d3\/2 strength is located at 0.20 MeV and has a cross section of 7.9 mb.\nThe experimental and theoretical inclusive cross sections are thus in the ratio Rs = 0.66(9),\nconsistent with systematics of suppression factors from other well-bound-nucleon knockout\nstudies [15, 40]. The excited state fraction from theory, 68%, is also in good agreement\nwith the measured value of 75(15)%. If the d3\/2 \u2212 d5\/2 proton orbit splitting is reduced\nby 1 MeV (to reflect the experimental result in 47K as discussed in section III), then the\nground state holds 95% of the s1\/2 strength and has a cross section of 3.5 mb, with 98% of\nthe d3\/2 strength residing in a state at 0.24 MeV that has a 7.7 mb cross section. These\ntwo calculations are consistent with each other in that they predict that the d3\/2 state has\na cross section a little more than twice the s1\/2 cross section, which is approximately what\nis seen in the data.\nAs demonstrated in Section III, the spin-orbit splitting of the d3\/2 and d5\/2 proton orbits is\nan important parameter for interpreting the results of the present two-proton knockout study\nof 42Si, other measurements of this nucleus and data on nearby nuclei. While no evidence for\nd5\/2 strength was observed in the present data set, the one-proton knockout reaction on\n44S\nprovides a means for determining the d3\/2\u2212d5\/2 proton spin-orbit splitting. A calculation of\nthe distribution of d5\/2 proton hole strength in\n43P using the Ref. [26] parameters, including\nthe 5.8 MeV d3\/2 \u2212 d5\/2 splitting and the resulting cross sections for population of these\nstates in the one proton knockout reaction (with the cross section calculation prescription\nas described in Refs. [29, 40]) is shown in the top panel of Fig. 4. It provides a prediction of\na concentration of d5\/2 proton hole strength (7.2 mb of cross section) at 2.24 MeV (although\nit is quite likely this strength is fragmented over several states - explaining its apparent\nabsence from the spectrum of Fig. 2), with a somewhat smaller concentration (2.2 mb) at\n1.54 MeV. This yields a centroid of 2.1 MeV. If instead the d3\/2 \u2212 d5\/2 splitting is set to\n4.8 MeV, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, the centroid of the d5\/2 strength is 1.5\nMeV (with a 6.4 mb concentration at 1.67 MeV and a 7.4 mb concentration at 1.32 MeV).\nWe conclude that the location of the d5\/2 proton hole strength in the one-proton knockout\nreaction provides a sensitive scale for determining the d3\/2\u2212d5\/2 proton spin-orbit splitting,\nand that this provides a motivation for another 44S one-proton knockout experiment with\nthe sensitivity (increased by means of greater statistics) required to detect the fragments of\nthe d5\/2 strength.\n12\nV. SUMMARY\nThe present data on the N = 28 isotones 42Si, 43P and 44S provide important insights\nregarding the most important factors influencing nuclear structure in this vicinity. First of\nall, the knockout reaction cross sections for populating 42Si and 43P and the 184 keV \u03b3-ray\nobserved in 43P firmly establish that the d3\/2 and s1\/2 proton orbits are nearly degenerate\nin these nuclei and that there is a substantial Z = 14 subshell closure separating these two\norbits from the d5\/2. The increase in the inclusive two-proton knockout cross section from\n42Si\nto 44S demonstrates the importance of the availability of valence protons for determining the\ncross section. In addition, a search for the d5\/2 proton strength in\n43P via a higher statistics\none-proton knockout experiment could quantify the size of the Z = 14 closure.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation through grants PHY-\n0456463, PHY-0110253, PHY-0244453 account 61-2275 (7032), the Department of Energy\nthrough grant DE-FG02-02ER-41220, the State of Florida, and by the United Kingdom\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Grant No. EP\/D003628\n[1] W.
