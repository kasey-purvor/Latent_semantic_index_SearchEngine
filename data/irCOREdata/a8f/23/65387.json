We provide a low cost approach of\nmeasuring and recording professional behaviour.\nBackground\nMeasuring professionalism in undergraduate medical stu-\ndents is a difficult process, and no one method has cur-\nrently emerged as the definitive means of assessment in\nthis field [1]. Recent literature reviews have highlighted\nthe lack of current evidence when measuring attitudes\nrelated to professionalism in medical education [2] and\nhave proposed 88 methods in the past 25 years [3]. This\nstudy examines critical incident reporting combined with\nvoluntary student reflection within a UK medical school\nas a method for exploring professional behaviours and\nattitudes in a cohort of pre-clinical undergraduate medical\nstudents.\nPublished: 15 July 2009\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:44 doi:10.1186\/1472-6920-9-44\nReceived: 26 November 2008\nAccepted: 15 July 2009\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/44\n\u00a9 2009 Hodges et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:44 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/44\nPage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nDefinition of Critical Incidents\nHere we define 'critical incidents' for undergraduate med-\nical students in lapses of professional standards or failures\nof diligence which in a clinical setting might have adverse\neffects on patients.\nThe advantages of critical incident reporting were first\npublished by Rhoton, documenting the study of anaesthe-\nsiology residents in a US teaching hospital during a 5 year\nperiod in the 1980s [4,5]. These studies found that only\n1% of negative behaviour related to areas of professional-\nism, and that there was a link between resident conscien-\ntiousness and unprofessional behaviour. Further to this,\ncritical incident reporting was found to permit early inter-\nvention in unacceptable behaviour [6]. Incident reporting\nforms in recent studies demonstrate the use of areas of\nfixed concern, derived from professional standards the\nfaculty feel students should exhibit, as a method to assess\nprofessionalism [7,8]. Critical incident reporting can be\nused as grounds for dismissal if continuing unprofes-\nsional behaviour is observed [7]. In the University of Cal-\nifornia, San Francisco, critical incident reports formed part\nof the medical student performance evaluation given on\ngraduation if two or more reports had been issued during\nundergraduate study [7]. Outside of medical education,\ncritical incident reporting remains an important aspect of\nimproving patient safety and is used in all NHS trusts to\nmonitor adverse events [9].\nStudent reflective skills have been seen to be highly\nimportant in the development of professional behaviours\n[10]. By studying student reflections on critical incident\nbehaviour, the development of good professional behav-\niours from reflection could be explored. Its introduction\ncould provide tools for students to examine their own\nbehaviour and attitudes, to consider the reasons why inci-\ndents occurred, and to allow solutions to be developed for\npreventing such incidents in the future.\nMethods\nExisting literature was reviewed to look for current evi-\ndence in this field. Medline was searched using keywords\nof 'professionalism' 'critical incident' 'incident reporting'\n'medical school' and 'undergraduate'. Further manual\nsearches within three leading journals (Medical Teacher,\nMedical Education and Academic Medicine) were done to\nensure all relevant papers were considered.\nThis study used an unrestrictive method of incident\nreporting to record unprofessional behaviour utilising\nexpert opinion by a process of connoisseurship [11].\nExperienced staff members reviewed all incident reports\nand made decisions based on knowledge and personal\nexperience as to whether the reports were valid and prima-\nrily focused on unprofessional behaviour. Unprofessional\nbehaviour was defined by any act which broke the School\ncode of conduct, which is based on the GMC Duties of a\nDoctor [12,13]. Students were given a copy of the report\nprior to a meeting with staff to discuss it, and invited to\nsubmit a reflective response using a structured form.\nThe study group was 228 undergraduate medical students\nin Years 1 and 2 of a U.K. medical school. The study mate-\nrial was all critical incident reports issued during the time-\nframe of a single academic year. The exclusion criteria\nwere reports that did not refer to professional behaviour\nand incomplete reports. Framework analysis was done\nusing a process of thematic analysis, and the data col-\nlected was analysed using a grounded theory approach\n[14]. All analysis took place at the end of the study period.\nInitial multiple readings of the transcripts with hand\nannotation was performed, before incorporating the data\ninto word processor format for further study. All three\nauthors analysed the data independently, with compara-\ntive discussion of findings performed to reach consensus\nand promote reliability of results.\nThe data used in this study was obtained from routinely\ncollected information regarding student assessment and\nwas not initially intended for the purpose of research.\nSubsequently, the information obtained proved, we\nbelieve, to be of generalisable interest [15]. Ethical\napproval from the University Ethics Committee for the\nuse of educational research data was obtained, on condi-\ntion that the data was anonymous and could not be\nlinked to the individuals concerned. As a result, individual\nstudent consent was not obtained. All student data was\nanonymised, identifiable comments were excluded, and\nno identifiable harms arose from this study being con-\nducted.\nResults\nOver the study period, 16 critical incident forms were\ncompleted by members of faculty from a cohort of 228\nstudents. Of these 2 were excluded following connoisseur\nreview as they failed to meet the criteria set. The 14 forms\nrelated to 9 students, some of whom had multiple forms.\nOf the 14 incidents forms, 7 had a reflective response.\nSeven elements of professionalism were raised by staff.\nThese were poor communication, unexplained absence,\nrecord keeping, meeting deadlines, positive commitment\nto studying, honesty, and patient confidentiality. Students\ndid not always recognise the same areas of professional-\nism as a concern within their reflections.\nThe following major themes emerged from analysis of the\ntranscripts.\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:44 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/44\nPage 3 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nImpacts and consequences\nAll students who reflected on the incidents considered the\nimpact and consequences of their actions. There was rec-\nognition of how the student was involved.\nExtract 1: 'This affected me and my studies.' (Student A)\nThere was also recognition that members of staff, patients\nand other students may also have been affected. Students\ndescribed the impact that their actions had on others,\nwhat burdens may have been placed upon them and what\nadditional work, if any, the student had created for them.\nExtract 2: 'It affected me and the people at my placement. I was\nnot as useful and productive as I could have been...it affected\nmy colleagues at the placement as they may have had to perform\na greater share of the work that would have otherwise been the\ncase.' (Student B)\nExtract 3: 'I did not attend my sessions in which I appreciate\nmy clinical tutor has given up valuable time to come in' (Stu-\ndent C)\nThe ideas of wasting the time of others and failure to com-\nplete their own work emerge from the explanations. Stu-\ndents are also concerned about how the incident may\nhave changed perceptions of themselves and other stu-\ndents.\nExtract 4: 'my patient may have been let down and lost respect\nfor the responsibility of medical students' (student A)\nThe concern of student concentrates on patient perception\nof the student which has been affected in a negative man-\nner.\nReflections\nIdentification of the responsibilities of a medical student\nis a necessary step to remediation. These reflections on the\nincidents fell into two sub themes: those of acceptance\nand those of rejection.\nAcceptance Reactions\nWith acceptance reactions, students demonstrated the rec-\nognition of fault in themselves, showed guilt and remorse\nfor their actions and acknowledged a lack of knowledge\ncould be the cause. Students included clear statements of\nacceptance.\nExtract 5: 'I fully accept that my behaviour has been unaccept-\nable'\n'My failure to provide explanations and consult with the tutor\nis unacceptable' (Student C)\nStudents also show the ability to describe how the event\nhas affected them emotionally and their intended future\nresponse.\nExtract 6: 'I feel very bad that I let this happen and it certainly\nwon't happen again'\n'I now realise that it was very serious and should not even have\nconsidered it' (student D)\nThere is also student acceptance of blame which had been\npreviously unrecognised.\nExtract 7:'For some reason it did not occur to me that the same\nprinciples applied in the lecture theatre' (student D)\nRejection reactions\nNot all students in the study felt the reports were an accu-\nrate description of the event which occurred, and\ndescribed aspects which they felt were out of their control.\nExtract 8: '...haven't received the test results from the medical\ncentre'\n'I was falsely led to believe...' (Student E)\nDenial of the accuracy of the event also occurred, and stu-\ndents disputed the incident. Students felt that their actions\nhave been misinterpreted by the staff and that their\nactions were not unprofessional. These rejection reactions\ncould also be seen to be both defiant and possibly com-\nplacent.\nExtract 9: 'I was not listening to music during lectures' (Stu-\ndent E)\nSome responses do not deny that the event occurred, but\nreflected a denial of the significance of the event which\noccurred. Students did not always agree that what was\nreported constituted a critical incident or problem with\nprofessionalism.\nExtract 10: 'No event, I missed a few important lectures.' (Stu-\ndent A)\nA minority of students recognised that their behaviour\nwas unprofessional from the view of staff involved, but\nbelieved that their actions were justified due to the cir-\ncumstances surrounding the issue.\nExtract 11: 'I worked most of the holiday and believe this time\nwould have been necessary regardless'\n'due to lack off work earlier in the year that I needed to catch\nup'\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:44 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/44\nPage 4 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n'... but I believe that the alternative would have hindered my\nrevision' (Student A)\nResponses\nStudents frequently identified further actions, which in\nturn related to whether they had made acceptance or\ndenial responses. Acceptance responses included remedi-\nation in the form of apologies:\nExtract 12: 'I will write a personal letter of apology' (Student\nC)\nExtract 13: 'I take full responsibility for my actions and sin-\ncerely apologise to both X and Y, whose lectures I enjoy very\nmuch.' (Student E)\nApologies can also relate to the theme of impact and con-\nsequences, with students being concerned with the per-\nceptions staff may have of them in light of the incident. By\napologising, students may hope to prevent this perception\nof them.\nRejection responses include suggestions for further\nactions by others, which could be constructive. Students\nfeel that their experiences could be used to make practical\nchanges to the course, and would as such be of benefit to\ntheir fellow students.\nExtract 14: '...instead of having three lectures on one topic, the\nstudent should be given a book to study with a certain time\nperiod. Then at the end of this time period there will be a review\nlecture to ensure everyone has understood.' (Student F)\nDiscussion\nThe approach of having critical incident reporting forms\nassociated with reflective documents appears to have the\npossibility of promoting student reflection as a necessary\nfirst step to remediation of inappropriate behaviours. Sug-\ngesting practical steps to avoid the repeat of the situation\nin the future shows potential progression through the\nreflective cycle, with the hope that future behaviour will\nfollow the changes the student suggests they could make.\nEven having such a system in place may serve as a pro-\nmoter of good behaviour or an inhibitor of adverse behav-\niour, since students know that the critical incident form\nwill be placed in their file. The evidence of Papadakis et al.\nsuggests that such incidents can serve as a predictor of\nfuture behaviour, and an organised system of collection of\nsuch data could facilitate future progression decisions, or\nsimplify the task of providing references or Dean's Letters.\nThe biggest barrier to gaining a positive outcome for fac-\nulty and student occurred when no reflective response was\nwritten by the student. In future use of the critical incident\nreporting, making reflection a compulsory aspect of the\nincident becomes an attractive proposition. An absence of\nreflection only has a negative value in assessing the stu-\ndent's professional behaviour, whereas student reflection\ncan have either positive or negative value.\nThe curriculum of medical schools already incorporates\nreflection as part of summative assessment for many dif-\nferent taught subjects, and the 'Report and Reflect' system\ncould be used in a similar manner. Establishing expected\noutcomes for reflection and having procedures in place\nfor students who fail to meet the outcomes would allow\nfor a structured assessment process for students involved\nin critical incidents. As a summative assessment it would\nalso have formative value, the student would learn what is\nexpected in future as a result, and would be able to change\ntheir professional behaviour as a result.\nWe acknowledge that there are limitations to the\napproach used. No evidence of data saturation was\nobserved in the responses, and the study needs to be\nextended. Since critical incidents are rare events, extended\nperiods of time will be required to build up a full analysis\nof causes and responses. The cohort of students involved\nin this study was small at 228, and the timeframe of single\nacademic year was short. Involving multiple centres and\nincreasing the timescale to the extent of 5\u201310 years, with\nfurther follow-up studies of students once working as doc-\ntors, would allow for improved reliability and could give\nevidence of predictive validity.\nThe utility of this approach can also be considered [16].\nReliability is dependent upon having staff with sufficient\nknowledge and experience to assess the reports. The edu-\ncational impact should be positive, which can be seen\nwhen reflective practice improves future professional\nbehaviour. Staff acceptability may relate to the time\ninvolved, with each report taking on average 90 minutes\nto complete in this study. Issues of validity relate to the\nGMC requirements for student behaviour, and for medi-\ncal school monitoring of such behaviour.\nConclusion\nThis study shows that by using a 'Report and Reflect' sys-\ntem of incident reporting, a strong platform can be created\nfrom which lapses in professional behaviour within the\nstudent body and be recorded and challenged. It has been\nseen that student reflection on critical incidents could pro-\nmote positive changes in professional behaviour. Further\nto this an absence of reflection, or the inability of a stu-\ndent to respond adequately to events, might be a future\nindicator of unprofessional behaviour. Critical incident\nreports are enhanced when combined with student reflec-\ntion.\nPublish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours \u2014 you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/info\/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:44 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/44\nPage 5 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJM was responsible for the study design and construction.\nAll authors worked equally in analysis of the data and gen-\neration of results.
