INTRODUCTION\nThe Franz-Keldysh effect ~FKE!, i.e., the modification of\noptical absorption spectra by an applied electric field, has\nbeen known for many years.1,2 Subsequently the generaliza-\ntion of the FKE to time-dependent electric fields, the dy-\nnamical Franz-Keldysh effect ~DFKE! has also been\nstudied.3 The quantity which characterizes the crossover be-\ntween the FKE and DFKE regimes is the ratio g between the\nponderomotive energy ~i.e., the average kinetic energy of a\nparticle of mass m and charge e in an electric field F0cos vt),\nEpon5\ne2F0\n2\n4mv2 , ~1!\nand the photon energy \\v . The problem may be treated in\nterms of multiphoton processes for g!1 or in terms of the\nFKE for g@1. The DFKE corresponds to g;1. In addition,\nsome manifestations of the DFKE are most noticeable when\nthe frequency of the driving field is near resonance with a\nsignificant dipole-allowed transition.\nIn atomic physics, transition energies are typically 1\n210 eV. For photon energies of this order, very high field\nstrengths are necessary to obtain g;1. Recent theoretical\nand experimental effort has been devoted to the DFKE in\nsemiconductor systems, where the internal transitions of ex-\ncitons ~i.e., hydrogenlike bound states of electron-hole pairs!\nare in the THz ~terahertz! regime ~a frequency of 1 THz is\nequivalent to a photon energy of approximately 4.1 meV).\nFor a photon energy near resonance with the 1s-2p exciton\ntransition, g;1 may be obtained with F;1 kV\/cm, an in-\ntensity which is now routinely available from sources such as\nfree-electron lasers.\nIn the initial work in semiconductor quantum wells,4 the\nCoulomb interaction was neglected, and it was calculated\nthat the DFKE blue shifts the main band-edge absorption\nstep by the ponderomotive energy, and increases the below-\ngap absorption. Subsequent studies have included the Cou-\nlomb interaction, and a rich variety of behavior has been\npredicted. It was shown both theoretically and experimen-\ntally in InGaAs quantum wells that the DFKE manifests it-\nself as a blue shift in the exciton peak.5 Other results include0163-1829\/2003\/67~16!\/165312~6!\/$20.00 67 1653the distribution of the resulting anisotropic wave packet and\nthe THz emission spectrum,6 and the dependence of the\nDFKE on the polarization of the THz field.7 Theoretical\nwork on the DFKE has been based on either Green\u2019s func-\ntion techniques,4,5,7 or the conceptually simpler extension of\nthe well-known semiconductor Bloch equations ~SBE\u2019s!\n~Ref. 8! to include the THz field.6,9\nTypically the DFKE is measured using pump-probe trans-\nmission experiments. In this paper we model such a setup\nhaving a cw-THz pump beam and an ultrashort interband\nprobe pulse. The absorption of the probe beam in the pres-\nence of the pump is then explored as a function of various\npump beam parameters. In Sec. II we outline the derivation\nof the extended SBE\u2019s and compare results obtained from\nthem with earlier Green\u2019s function calculations. Intuitively,\none expects the phase of the THz field to be significant as its\noscillation period (;500 fs) is much longer than the 50-fs\nprobe pulse; in Sec. III we show the dependence of the vari-\nous features in the absorption spectrum on the phase of the\nTHz field at the probe time. In Sec. IV we present further\nnew results on the intensity dependence of the below-gap\nabsorption features, and then in Sec. V we discuss the ap-\npearance of the DFKE in reflectivity spectra. Finally, in Sec.\nVI we present our conclusions, including the prospects for\nconfirming our predictions in experiment.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nAs the interband probe field, \u00ab(v), is weak, its absorption\nspectrum may be calculated from the polarization it induces\nin the sample as\na~v!}ImS P~v!\u00ab~v! D , ~2!\nwhere \u00ab(t) is the probe field. The polarization is given in the\nHartree-Fock approximation by the semiconductor Bloch\nequations.

The THz field is\nFTHz(t)5F0cos(vTHzt2u), where u is the phase of the THz\nfield. Although we refer throughout to the \u2018\u2018F\u2019\u2019 field in these\nequations as the THz field, the equations themselves are\nequally valid for fields of any frequency significantly below\nresonance with the gap including static ones.\nWithout the THz field, in the 2D case the SBE\u2019s have\ncylindrical symmetry. The THz field breaks the symmetry,\nand it is thus necessary to solve the extended SBE\u2019s on a 2D\ngrid of points in k space. It is convenient for numerical pur-\nposes to introduce a moving frame of reference k85k\n1(e\/\\)* tFTHz(t8)dt8. The transformed equations are then\nformally the same as the zero-field SBEs, except that the\nband dispersions oscillate in k space. We also make the\nrelaxation-time approximation for the polarization dephas-\ning, ]Pk \/]tucoll52Pk \/Tdeph . As we use a weak interband16531probe pulse in our calculations, the carrier populations are\nlow, and we are justified in taking ]n (e ,h)k \/]tucoll50 and\nneglecting screening.\nThroughout this paper, we use a two-band model of a\nsemiconductor with GaAs parameters (me50.063m0 , mh\n50.51m0 , \u00abr513.0, where m0 is the free-electron mass.!\nWe also introduce a form factor into the Coulomb potential\nto account for the finite width of the quantum well ~taken as\n12 nm!. These parameters give a 1s exciton binding energy\nof 9.5 meV (2.3 THz). We choose a dephasing time of 3 ps;\nthis gives a 1s linewidth of ;0.5 meV, equivalent to the\nvery best available samples. Our interband probe is centered\nat time t50, with FWHM 50 fs and a central frequency\nresonant with the band edge.\nOne interesting effect of a THz field is the appearance in\nthe absorption spectrum of signatures of otherwise dark ex-\nciton states. This was first demonstrated using Green\u2019s func-\ntion methods.10 For instance a feature appears one THz pho-\nton energy below the 2p state due to the possibility of\ncreating a 2p exciton by simultaneous absorption of one\nprobe photon and one THz photon ~the \u2018\u20182p replica\u2019\u2019 peak.!\nThis feature and its anticrossing with the 1s exciton peak are\nshown in Fig. 1. The energy difference between the 2p rep-\nlica and the 2s peak is greater~less! than \\vTHz if vTHz is\ntuned above~below! the 1s-2p transition. This is due to the\nac Stark shift of the 2p state, which we shall discuss in more\ndetail in Sec. IV. We also note that in the spectra with THz\nfrequency 2.1 THz there is a more complicated double peak\nat around 29 meV. This appears to be due to a more com-\nplicated anticrossing phenomenon involving the replica of\nthe continuum p states.\nIII. PHASE DEPENDENCE\nNear the band edge, there are two principle THz gener-\nated features. We have already mentioned the 2p replica\npeak which is seen below the gap. The second is a sideband\nfeature10 which appears 2\\vTHz above the main 1s peak.\nThis feature corresponds to the absorption of a single inter-\nFIG. 1.

In contrast, the\n2p replica has very little phase dependence. The exciton\npeaks, while not changing shape or shifting, vary in height\nby about 15% as the phase changes, although this is hard to\nsee in the figure. It is also worth noting that while the 1s\npeak is strongest around phase 0.0p and lowest around phase\n0.5p , the reverse is true for the 2s peak.\nIn DFKE experiments where the two fields are generated\nby different lasers, it may be difficult to lock the arrival of\nthe probe pulse to a particular phase of the THz field. For a\nsingle measurement, one would therefore obtain a spectrum\nat an unknown phase. If, as usual, an average over a number\nof different individual experimental spectra is taken, then the\nresults should be compared with phase-averaged theoretical\npredictions. We find ~Fig. 2! that in our model the manifes-\ntations of the sideband in the continuum cancel on phase\naveraging, and the spectrum is then featureless in its vicinity.\nWe thus expect the sideband feature to be very difficult to\nobserve in transmission experiments ~as opposed to\nluminescence11!, unless it is possible to control or at least\nmeasure accurately the phase of the THz field.\nFIG. 2.

Lowest curves\u2014average of spec-\ntra over phase for the same system parameters.16531IV. INTENSITY DEPENDENCE\nIn Fig. 3 we show the dependence of the absorption spec-\ntrum on the THz intensity for two different THz frequencies.\nIt has previously been demonstrated, in a system with greater\nbroadening,5 that the main exciton peak shows qualitatively\ndifferent behavior depending on whether the THz field is\ntuned above or below the 1s-2p transition. The effect of the\nDFKE itself is to blue shift all the main features. When vTHz\nis near resonant with the 1s-2p transition, the ac Stark shifts\nof those states are also significant. If the THz frequency is\ntuned above the 1s-2p transition, vTHz.v1s-2p , the ac Stark\neffect blue shifts the 1s state and redshifts the 2p state. If\nvTHz,v1s-2p , then the Stark shifts are in the opposite direc-\ntions. Thus if vTHz.v1s-2p the 1s peak blue shifts for all\nTHz intensities, while if vTHz,v1s-2p the 1s peak redshifts\nat low THz intensities, but as the intensity increases the\nDFKE dominates and a net blue shift occurs.5\nWith the short dephasing time we use, it is possible to\ninvestigate the intensity dependence of the other below-\nbandgap features. Both the 2s and the dark 2p exciton states\nare blue shifted by the DFKE at all THz intensities. As the\n1s-2s transition is not dipole-allowed there is no significant\nStark effect of the 2s peak, but the 2p state and its replica do\nundergo a Stark shift. If vTHz,v1s-2p , the Stark shift of the\n2p peak is in the blue direction, and the 2p replica therefore\nblueshifts more than the 2s peak, Fig. 3~a!. Conversely, if\nFIG. 3. ~a! absorption spectra for THz frequency 1.7 THz. ~b!\nabsorption spectra for THz frequency 2.3 THz.

GALBRAITH PHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 165312 ~2003!vTHz.v1s-2p , then the net blue shift of the 2p replica is\nsmaller than that of the 2s peak, Fig. 3~b!.\nFor the spectra plotted in Fig. 3, the 2p replica and the 1s\nexciton peaks may be resolved clearly. We observe that as\nthe intensity increases, the 1s peak broadens. This is presum-\nably due to the THz-induced oscillations in the relative po-\nsition of the bound electron and hole\u2014when these are com-\nparable in size with the exciton we expect the corresponding\nabsorption feature to be significantly broadened. In analogy\nwith Sec. I, we may quantify this by calculating the ratio a\nbetween the maximum displacement of a classical particle of\nmass m in an applied field F0cos vTHzt with the correspond-\ning 2D Bohr radius\na5\ne3F0\n2p\\2v2\u00ab0\u00ab\n. ~6!\nFor THz frequency 1.7 THz and GaAs parameters we obtain\na.0.4 for F051.0 kV\/cm, a.1.3 for F053.0 kV\/cm, and\na.2.2 for F055.0 kV\/cm. These values are consistent with\nour results, Fig. 3~a!. The greater broadening at 2.3 THz,\ncompared with 1.7 THz, may be accounted for as 2.3 THz is\napproximately equivalent to the 1s exciton binding energy,\nand therefore may actually break up the exciton.\nSeveral authors have performed DFKE calculations using\na purely two-dimensional Coulomb potential. One can obtain\nrealistic exciton binding energies by adjusting the electron\nand hole effective masses. We show in Fig. 4 results obtained\nusing the pure two-dimensional model ~i.e. no form factor in\nthe potential! and THz frequency 2.3 THz. We use the same\ndielectric constant as our other calculations, and we obtain\nthe same 1s binding energy by altering the effective masses\nto give a reduced mass of 0.0315me . The n52 exciton\nstates, and therefore the 2p replica are at lower binding en-\nergies in the pure 2D model than the finite well-width model.\nWe also find that the blue shifts in both the 1s peak and the\n2p replica are smaller in these pure 2D calculations\u2014the\nlatter result is slightly surprising as 2s peak actually shifts\nfurther in the pure 2D model than in the finite well-width\nmodel.

REFLECTIVITY\nThus far we have considered only the manifestation of the\nDFKE in absorption spectra as typically absorption measure-\nments are straightforward to interpret. However, for GaAs\/\nAlGaAs quantum wells the substrate is absorbing and must\nbe removed. To avoid any possible damage during this etch-\ning the possibility of using reflectivity measurements should\nbe considered. In this section we compare some of our cal-\nculated absorption spectra with the corresponding reflectivity\nresults. Reflectivity data are often more difficult to interpret\nfor a variety of reasons. First, it usually has a lower signal-\nnoise ratio and broader linewidths than transmission data\ndue, among other factors, to multiple reflections in a multi-\nwell sample, and to interface roughness. Second, and more\nfundamentally, where there is a simple peak in absorption,\nthe corresponding feature in the reflectivity spectrum is a\nbroader \u2018\u2018hump dip.\u2019\u2019 In practice, the clearest signal in reflec-\ntivity may often be obtained by measuring directly the dif-\nferential reflectivity ~DR!, defined in our case as RTHz2R0,\nwhere RTHz and R0 are the reflectivities with and without the\nTHz field, respectively.\nFor small changes the deviation of the reflectivity from its\nbackground value may be calculated as\nR~v!2Rback~v!}ReF P~v!\u00ab~v!

The various features are more difficult to resolve\nseparately in DR than in absorption. Also, as features in DR\nare typically the difference between two hump dips they can\ntake a variety of complicated shapes. Where it can be re-\nsolved separately, the 2p replica appears as a shoulder on the\nmain 1s feature. Unlike in absorption, it is difficult to deter-\nFIG. 5.

Therefore, the difference in\nease of interpretation between absorption and DR is likely to\nbe greater still in experiment than in the plots we have pre-\nsented.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented a detailed study of the effects of a THz\nelectric field on the absorption spectrum of GaAs quantum\nwells, including the dependence of the various features on\nthe phase of the THz field and on its intensity. The main\nbelow-gap features in the absorption spectra, namely, the 1s\npeak and the single-photon THz replica of the 2p peak, do\nnot depend significantly on the phase of the THz field. How-\never, the feature in the continuum corresponding to a side-\nband of the 1s exciton, while not shifting, changes shape as\nthe phase of the THz field varies. As a result, this feature will\nbe difficult to observe in experiment unless the phase of the\nTHz field can be closely controlled.\nThe DFKE itself blue shifts all the main absorption fea-\ntures at all THz intensities, but the direction of the ac Stark\nshifts depends on whether the THz field is tuned above or\nbelow the 1s-2p transition. The interplay between the two\neffects determines the direction and size of the shifts in the\n1s peak and the 2p replica. We expect that it will prove\neasier to observe these features in transmission experiments\nrather than reflection, both due to the greater experimental\nbroadening and the intrinsic spectral shapes in the latter. We\nalso find that in order to make quantitative predictions for the\nsideband and replica features, it is necessary to include a\nfinite well width in the calculations.\nIn order for the fine detail of the spectra, including the\nTHz replica of the 2p exciton, to be observed experimen-\ntally, a sample with very narrow 1s exciton linear absorption\nlinewidth ~of the order of 1 meV! is required. In samples\nwith greater broadening, the replica would manifest itself as\na shoulder on, or an additional shift of, the 1s peak. With the\nlatest experimental technology and high quality samples,\nhowever, we are hopeful that it will prove possible to test our\npredictions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with C.

The THz field makes a neg-\nligible contribution to the interband terms in the band index\nsum with l\u00del8\u2014these terms are the origin of the electric-\nfield terms in the original SBE\u2019s.

As it\nstands, this is strictly ill defined as the position operator r\u02c6\ndoes not have the same periodicity as the lattice.12 However,\nmaking the approximation that the Bloch wave functions are\nplane waves and taking the continuum limit, one can write\nMkk8\ncc\n52\ni\nL2 \u201ek8E drei(k82k)\u0095r52i\u201ek8d~k2k8!.\n~A5!\nExpressions involving the gradient of the Dirac delta func-\ntion under an integral may be evaluated, depending on the k\nand k8 dependence of the rest of the integrand, either by\nintegration by parts, or by taking the gradient operator out-\nside the integral. It must be emphasized that this representa-\ntion of the matrix element only applies once the continuum\nlimit has been taken, as the k-space gradient operator is not\ndefined on a discrete lattice of points in k space.
