Introduction\n[2] The investigation of the geoeffectiveness of coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions\n(CIRs) has recently gained much interest in the context of\nspace weather studies and the upcoming launch of missions\naimed at studying such structures and their impact on Earth\n[Zhang and Burlaga, 1988; Gosling et al., 1991; Gosling,\n1993; Kamide et al., 1998; Gonzalez et al., 2002a, 2002b;\nCane and Richardson, 2003; Li and Luhmann, 2004;Wu and\nLepping, 2002, 2005; Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006]. It is\nknown that a portion of CMEs have a well-defined embedded\nmagnetic flux rope-like structure; these are called magnetic\nclouds.Magnetic clouds often have a bipolar structure in their\nmagnetic field. When the orientation of their main axis has a\nsignificant horizontal component, they are usually referred to\nas north-south or south-north polarity magnetic clouds.\nMagnetic clouds are often geoeffective structures as they\nusually possess a relatively strong and persistent southward\nmagnetic field component either in the leading or trailing\nportion of the structure. However, the geoeffectiveness of\nCMEs can also be driven by the preceding sheath region of\nthe CMEs owing to its compressed and fluctuating nature\n[Gosling et al., 1991; Huttunen et al., 2002]. CIRs are\nsimilarly important geoeffective structures [Kamide et al.,\n1998; Gonzalez et al., 2002b; Borovsky and Steinberg, 2006;\nDenton et al., 2006] as the increased speed during such\nevents is often accompanied by a southward component of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), leading to a strong\ncoupling through a large solar wind electric field imposed on\nthe magnetosphere. The geoeffectiveness of solar wind\nstructures (either CMEs or CIRs) is thus to first order\nattributable to the presence of a large solar wind electric field\nand a large dynamic pressure [e.g., Burton et al., 1975;\nAkasofu, 1981].\n[3] A commonly used index for assessment of geomag-\nnetic activity is Dst, which is a measure of the strength of the\nring current. Dst has been shown to correlate strongly with\nthe magnitude of the solar wind electric field and dynamic\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, A09208, doi:10.1029\/2005JA011566, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Space Science and Applications, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los\nAlamos, New Mexico, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JA011566$09.00\nA09208 1 of 10\npressure. These correlations allowed Burton et al. [1975] to\nconstruct a semiempirical model of theDst response based on\ninputs from the solar wind parameters. This predictive model\nwas further modified and adapted successively by O\u2019Brien\nand McPherron [2000] and Wang et al. [2003]. It is known\nthat contributions to Dst come from other (e.g., tail) current\nsystems as well [e.g., Hakkinen et al., 2003; Ganushkina et\nal., 2004]. These currents may not be separated in the present\nstudy. Their contribution, however, may be viewed as part of\nthe global geoeffectiveness of the events under consideration\nhere.\n[4] From the study of the statistical significance of the\ndifference between their predicted and the measured Dst,\nO\u2019Brien and McPherron [2000] concluded that the errors in\ntheir model were caused by a few rather than many sources.\nAn obvious source of errors is that of the measurements\nthemselves [O\u2019Brien and McPherron, 2000]. In addition,\nbecause of the sole dependence of the model on the solar\nwind electric field and dynamic pressure, the effects of other\noperative physical processes ought to constitute additional\nsources of discrepancy. One such mechanism investigated\nhere is a preconditioning of the magnetosphere under north-\nward IMF; i.e., the possibility that the magnetosphere con-\nfigures itself in a specific state as a function of the properties\nof the preceding solar wind conditions, which in turn may\naffect the strength of ensuing storms. Of particular impor-\ntance in this context is the formation of a colder and denser\nplasma sheet during northward IMF [Terasawa et al., 1997;\nFujimoto et al., 1998]. Both observations [Borovsky et al.,\n1997; Thomsen et al., 1998] andmodeling efforts [Jordanova\net al., 1998;Kozyra et al., 1998] have shown evidence for the\nrole of the plasma sheet density in storm-time ring current\nstrength, with larger plasma sheet density leading to larger\nnegative Dst excursions. A lower plasma sheet temperature\nmay add to the ring current strength as colder populations\nmay convect deeper Earthward than their hotter counterpart\n[Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000]. In this paper we argue that the for-\nmation of a cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS) may lead to an\nenhanced Dst during the main phase of a storm as that denser\nplasma is being pushed inward during the strong convection\nassociated with the storm main phase.\n[5] A number of studies have investigated a possible\ndependence of CMEs geoeffectiveness on the polarity of\nmagnetic clouds [Zhang and Burlaga, 1988; Fenrich and\nLuhmann, 1998; Li and Luhmann, 2004; Wu and Lepping,\n2002, 2005]. However, a relation between CME magnetic\npolarity and their absolute geoeffectiveness (in terms of Dst\nin particular) has not been fully pinned down. This is in part\ndue to the lack of extended databases of magnetic clouds, i.e.,\nonly a subset of all CMEs. It is further complicated by the\ncommon presence of a sheath ahead of the CME itself, which\noften is the first geoeffective part of CMEs [Gosling et al.,\n1991]. Periods of calms (defined as a Kp index lower than 1+\nfor at least 6 hours) before CIR-driven storms have been\nnoted and investigated recently by Borovsky and Steinberg\n[2006]. They showed that such calm periods occur more\nfrequently prior to CIR-driven storms than during more\ntypical solar wind conditions. In their discussion, they\nsuggested that such periods of calm may lead to a precondi-\ntioning of the magnetosphere by, in particular, (1) a possible\nmass loading after the buildup of a dense plasmasphere\nduring quiet (low Kp) intervals, and (2) the formation of a\ncold and dense plasma sheet, in response to presumably\nnorthward IMF (as also suggested by Thomsen et al. [2003]).\n[6] There is ample evidence that both double high-latitude\nreconnection [Song and Russell, 1992; \u00d8ieroset et al., 2005;\nLi et al., 2005; Lavraud et al., 2005a, 2006] and the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instability [Fujimoto et al., 1998;Hasegawa et al.,\n2004] may participate in the formation of the cold, dense\nplasma sheet (CDPS) under northward IMF. Here we do not\nfocus on the relative importance of these processes, we only\nrely on the fact that the presence of the CDPS following\nextended periods of northward IMF is well established [e.g.,\nTerasawa et al., 1997] and that this material has access to the\ninner magnetosphere under certain conditions [Thomsen et al.,\n2003; Lavraud et al., 2005b].\n[7] Any signature of the dependence of storm strength on\nthe preceding solar wind conditions (IMF direction in\nparticular) is necessarily embedded in the measured Dst\ntrend. Primarily, Dst responds to coupling through the solar\nwind electric field and dynamic pressure. Therefore, to assess\nthe role of secondary effects such as a preconditioning of\nthe magnetosphere under northward IMF, one must either\n(1) compare the magnetospheric response of CMEs or CIRs\nwhich have similar solar wind characteristics apart from their\nmagnetic structure (resulting in a limited number of suitable\nevents, if any) or (2) statistically compare the actual magne-\ntospheric response to that predicted by models which are\ndeveloped to take into account the effects of the solar wind\nelectric field and dynamic pressure. In the latter case,\nsystematic differences observed between different sets of\nstorms selected for specific preceding IMF conditions can be\ninterpreted to be due to other coupling processes. This is the\napproach we use in the present study. In addition, we use in\nsitu measurements of the density and temperature of the\nnightside plasma sheet to assess the role of the formation of a\nCDPS as a preconditioning mechanism.\n[8] We first describe the data, the Dst model and the event\nselection criteria in section 2. In section 3 we show and\ndiscuss the results. These primarily pertain to the difference\nobserved between the measured and modeled Dst, as a\nfunction of preceding IMF conditions. The connection to\nplasma sheet density and temperature is then documented\nwith measurements of the densities and temperatures in the\nnightside sector of geosynchronous orbit. Potential limiting\nfactors to this mechanism are discussed in section 3.5. We\ndraw our conclusions in section 4.\n2. Data, Dst Model, and Event Selection\n2.1. Data\n[9] In this study, we use solar wind data from the OMNI-2\ndata set [King and Papitashvili, 2005]. This data set extends\nfrom 1963 with hourly averages of solar wind data from\nvarious solar wind monitors. Lag times from the observing\nspacecraft to Earth are already applied in the data set. The\nOMNI-2 data set has the same time resolution as the Dst\nindex and therefore was used by O\u2019Brien and McPherron\n[2000] for the construction of theDstmodel described below.\nDst andKp data are also taken from the OMNI-2 data set. The\nGSM coordinates are used throughout the paper.\n[10] We also make use of measurements from the Los\nAlamos National Laboratory MPA (Magnetospheric Plasma\nAnalyzer) instruments onboard geosynchronous satellites.\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n2 of 10\nA09208\nThe MPA instruments are electrostatic analyzers. They\nmeasure the three-dimensional energy-per-charge distribu-\ntions of both ions and electrons. Here we only utilize\nmeasurements of the ion density and temperature, which\nare calculated for the energy range [100\u201345000] eV\n[Thomsen et al., 1999] (all ions are assumed to be\nprotons). The reader is referred to Bame et al. [1993]\nand McComas et al. [1993] for detailed description of the\nMPA instruments. For the current study, data are taken\nfrom six different satellites in geosynchronous orbit cov-\nering the period of interest between 1994 and 2003.\n2.2. Dst Model\n[11] The Dst model used in this study comes from Wang\net al. [2003]. It is a modified version of the O\u2019Brien and\nMcPherron [2000] model that is designed to better represent\nthe Dst dependence on the solar wind dynamic pressure.\nThese models are based on that originally developed by\nBurton et al. [1975].\n[12] The measured Dst index is known to have a substan-\ntial contribution coming from the magnetopause current\nsystem (i.e., the currents over the entire magnetopause induce\ndeflections of the magnetic field at the surface of the Earth\nthat are necessarily included as part of the Dst index). This\ncontribution ought to be removed prior to analyzingDst as an\nactual index representing the strength of the intramagneto-\nspheric currents, and, in particular, of the ring current itself.\nContribution from the magnetopause currents mainly\ndepends on the solar wind dynamic pressure and, in the\nmodel used here, is given by [e.g., O\u2019Brien and McPherron,\n2000]:\nDst* \u00bc Dst \u0002 7:26\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nPram\np\n\u00fe 11 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Pram is the solar wind dynamic pressure, Dst is the\nmeasured index andDst* is that corrected for the contribution\nof magnetopause currents.\n[13] In the models, Dst* variations are assumed to be\nthe result of an injection term (first right hand term in\nequation (2)) and a decay term (second right hand term in\nequation (2), where \u0002 is a decay timescale in hours):\nd\ndt\nDst*\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Q\u00f0t\u00de \u0002 Dst*\u00f0t\u00de\n\u0002\n\u00f02\u00de\nThe statistical analysis of the response of Dst* to solar wind\nparameters allowed Burton et al. [1975], and later O\u2019Brien\nand McPherron [2000] and Wang et al. [2003], to find the\nfunctional dependence of each term in the Dst* variations as\na function of the solar wind electric field (Ey or VBz\nparameter, in mV\/m) and the solar wind dynamic pressure\n(Pram in nPa). For the results shown in the next sections, we\nused the parameterization from Wang et al. [2003]. For the\ninjection term Q (nT h\u00021), this parameterization is as\nfollows:\nQ \u00bc 0 VBz \u0006 0:49 mV=m \u00f03a\u00de\nQ \u00bc \u00024:4\u00f0VBz\u0002 0:49\u00de Pram\nP0\n\u0003 \u0004\u0004\nVBz > 0:49 mV=m \u00f03b\u00de\nwhere the best fit parameters P0 and \u0004 were found to be\n3.0 nPa and 0.2, respectively. The decay timescale \u0002 (in\nhours) from equation (2) has the following parameteriza-\ntion:\n\u0002 \u00bc 8:70e6:66=\u00f06:04\u00fePram\u00de Bz \u0007 0 nT \u00f04a\u00de\n\u0002 \u00bc 2:40e9:74=\u00f04:69\u00feVBz\u00de Bz < 0 nT \u00f04b\u00de\nThe implementation of this Dst* model thus requires that\nsolar wind data be available. In our analysis, from a given\nstart time forward, the Dst* index is calculated at time t + Dt\n(Dt is 1 hour) by straight integration of equation (2) using\nthe solar wind data at time t as input. In this paper, we will\nonly show Dst* values, i.e., both model and measured Dst at\ntime t are corrected for the magnetopause current contribu-\ntion using equation (1). The results shown in this paper also\nhold when using the O\u2019Brien and McPherron [2000]\nparameterization instead of that of Wang et al. [2003].\n2.3. Event Selection\n[14] We study both CME- and CIR-driven storms. The\nlist of CMEs used in this study comes from Cane and\nRichardson [2003]. The list of CIRs we used comes from\nBorovsky and Steinberg [2006, also private communication,\n2006]. As one aim of our study is to compare measured and\nmodeled Dst indices, only CME- and CIR-driven storms\nhaving good solar wind data coverage were selected. In\naddition, we require that the storms be sufficiently, but not too\nstrong, i.e., that during the 12 hours following storm onset,\n(1) the Kp index increases to a value of at least 4+, (2) the\ndifference between the storm onset Dst value and the\nminimum Dst value is at least 40 nT, (3) there is neither\nobvious strong activity before the storm onset nor a large\nmultiple peak main phase, and (4) the minimum Dst is in the\nrange [\u000230, \u0002150] nT. This last criterion is required to hold\nfor the entire storm duration and comes from the fact that the\nO\u2019Brien andMcPherron [2000] model has been derived from\nthe analysis of storms havingminimumDst values larger than\n\u0002150 nT, and it is thus valid only in that range. The storm\nonset times were determined by visual inspection of the data\n(from theDst andVBz values in particular). This set of criteria\nled to a total of 60 CME-driven storms for which the onset\ntimes are listed in Table 1. The set of 38 CIR-driven storms is\nlisted in Table 2.\n3. Results\n3.1. Illustration From Two Selected CME-Driven\nStorms\n[15] As the Dst* model used in this study comes from a\nsimple integration of equation (2) forward in time, the choice\nof the start time for integration may be critical. For consis-\ntency we begin the integration at a similar relative time for\neach storm. For every event in this study, the start time for the\nDst* model is taken to be 12 hours before the storm onset\ntimes listed in Tables 1 and 2. We construct the model Dst*\ntraces for the next 24 hours, i.e., taking into account the\n12 first hours of the storm main phase. We then compare\nthose to the measured Dst* traces.\n[16] Here we first illustrate the analysis and goal of the\nstudy by showing two sample CME-driven storm events.\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n3 of 10\nA09208\nThe first CME occurred on 22 January 2000 and the second\non 25 June 1998. The relevant data are shown in Figure 1\nfor each event, drawn in black and red, respectively, for\n24 hours surrounding storm onset. Figure 1 shows the solar\nwind dynamic pressure (Pram) (Figure 1a), the IMF magni-\ntude (Figure 1b), the y component of the solar wind electric\nfield (VBz) (Figure 1c), the IMF absolute clock angle (CA =\njtan\u00021(By\/Bz)j) (Figure 1d), the measured (solid) and\nmodeled (dashed) Dst* index (Figure 1e), and the Kp index\n(Figure 1f). The x axis corresponds to epoch time, in hours,\nrelative to the storm onset.\n[17] The two events were chosen for their clear difference\nin terms of the prevailing IMF direction prior to storm onset.\nAlso, the other main parameters were quite similar during\nthe first hours of the storm main phase (VBz and Pram in\nparticular). The 22 January 2000 event (black) corresponds\nto a case with steady horizontal IMF for more than 6 hours\npreceding storm onset, with an IMF absolute clock angle of\nCA \t 90\u0001 (Figure 1d). By contrast, the 25 June 1998 event\n(red) was preceded by a strong northward IMF (CA \t 30\u0001)\nfor over 6 hours.\n[18] For the 12 hours preceding the 22 January 2000\nstorm, the y component of the solar wind electric field (Ey)\nwas slightly positive (Figure 1c), leading to a Dst* value of\nthe order \u000210 to \u000220 nT. The Dst* value during the 12\nhours preceding the 25 June 1998 was slightly higher (10\u2013\n20 nT) owing to a negative Ey (northward IMF). At storm\nonset, corresponding to a large increase in Ey, both cases\nshow a large decrease in Dst*.

On 22 January\n2000 the Dst* values kept decreasing until the end of the\n12 hour interval after storm onset owing to a more\nsustained positive Ey.\n[19] The feature to note in Figure 1 is the fact that although\nthe solar wind data for the two events appear similar during\nthe first hours of the main phase, the model Dst* (red dashed\nlines in Figure 1e) underestimates the decrease in Dst*\nmeasured (red solid lines) for the main phase of the event\npreceded by northward IMF. The underestimation reaches\nabout\t30 nTat 5 hours after onset, corresponding to 30% of\nthe measured Dst* value at that time. By contrast, the event\npreceded by horizontal IMF (black lines) is overall well re-\nproduced by the model Dst*.\n3.2. Analysis of CME-Driven Storms\n[20] To search for a systematic discrepancy between the\nmodeled and measured Dst* as a function of the prevailing\nIMF direction during the period preceding storm onset, we\nconduct a superposed epoch analysis of the set of CME-\ndriven storms (Table 1). Figure 2 shows superposed epoch\naverages for the 24 hours surrounding storm onset for the 60\nCME-driven storms. The 60 events were divided into two\nsets based on the preceding IMF conditions. In Figure 2, the\nblack curves correspond to the superposed epoch averages\nof the parameters for events which have at most 1 hour\n(1 OMNI-2 data value) of IMF absolute clock angle CA < 60\u0001\n(i.e., at most 1 hour of strong northward IMF) during the\n6 hours preceding storm onset. The IMF preceding the storm\nis thus mainly horizontal or southward for these events. The\ntotal number of events fulfilling this criterion is 27 (out of 60).\nThe red curves correspond to the superposed epoch averages\nfrom events which are preceded (within 6 hours) by at least\ntwo hours of IMF directed northward, defined as CA < 60\u0001.\nThirty-three events fulfill this criterion. In the following, we\nrefer to the former type of events as \u2018\u2018horizontal\/southward\nIMF case\u2019\u2019 and to the latter as \u2018\u2018northward IMF case.\u2019\u2019 In\nTables 1 and 2, the \u2018\u2018N\u2019\u2019 (for northward) and \u2018\u2018S\u2019\u2019(for\nsouthward) notations in the Bz column refer to the subset of\nIMF preconditioning to which each event belongs to accord-\nFigure 1.

Error bars show the mean absolute\ndeviation of the mean.\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n5 of 10\nA09208\ning to our selection criteria. The choice of a clock angle of\n60\u0001 as a selection criterion comes from the fact that both\ndouble high-altitude reconnection and the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability may be effective in forming a cold, dense plasma\nsheet for such low clock angle values.\n[21] In Figure 2, one observes that (1) the Kp values are\nsimilar for both sets of events (Figure 2e), (2) the VBz param-\neter (or Ey in Figure 2b) and absolute IMF CA (Figure 2c)\naremore negative and lower, respectively, in the interval prior\nto storm onset for the events preceded by northward IMF, as\na result of the selection criterion, and (3) after storm onset\nEy is somewhat larger in the case of the events preceded by\nhorizontal\/southward IMF. This latter characteristic is re-\nsponsible for a faster (measured and modeled) Dst* decrease\nin the first 2 hours following storm onset (Figure 2d). How-\never, it appears that the overall decrease in measured Dst*\nduring the main phase of the storm is globally underestimated\nby the model in the case of events preceded by northward\nIMF (red curves). Indeed, compared to the model predictions,\nstorms preceded by northward IMF appear to be stronger than\nthose with no such preceding northward interval (Figure 2d).\nFor the northward IMF case, the average underestimation is\nof \t10 nT a few hours after storm onset. The observed\ndifference is of the order of the average absolute deviation of\nthe mean (i.e., the average absolute deviation from the mean\ndivided by the square root of the number of events) shown as\nthe statistical error bars on both the measured and modeled\nDst*, and is therefore not dramatic. However, it corresponds\nto \t15% of the average Dst* at this time; this trend will\nbe confirmed by the separate study of CIR-driven storms in\nsection 3.3.\n[22] It is worth noting that the correction (equation (1)) to\nremove the influence of the magnetopause current system\ndoes not seem to performwell generally. Figure 2a shows that\nthe dynamic pressure of the solar wind (Pram) is large for both\nsets of events. The discrepancy observed before storm onset\nbetween the modeled and measured Dst* for both cases\n(Figure 2d) suggests that the pressure correction is not large\nenough. The discrepancy is slightly larger for the northward\nIMF cases (which have larger solar wind pressure associ-\nated with them). If an additional pressure correction were\napplied to the high-Pram main phase interval after onset, the\ncorrected Dst* would fall even further below the modeled\nvalue for the northward IMF case, therefore increasing the\ndiscrepancy for these conditions.\n3.3. Analysis of CIR-Driven Storms\n[23] Figure 3 presents the superposed epoch results from\nthe analysis of the 38 CIR-driven storms listed in Table 2. The\nanalysis performed and the event selection criteria are exactly\nthe same as those used in the previous section for CME-\ndriven storms. The format of Figure 3 is the same as Figure 2.\nThe total number of events corresponding to the horizontal\/\nsouthward (northward) IMF case is 24 (14) out of 38.\n[24] In Figure 3, one again observes that (1) the Kp values\n(Figure 3e) are similar for both sets of events (horizontal\/\nsouthward and northward IMF cases), (2) the VBz parameter\n(or Ey, Figure 3b) and absolute IMF CA (Figure 3c) are\nmore negative and lower, respectively, in the interval prior to\nstorm onset for the events preceded by northward IMF (red\ncurves), again as a result of the selection criteria, and (3) after\nstorm onset, Ey is somewhat larger in the case of the events\npreceded by horizontal\/southward IMF (black curves). In this\ncase, this latter characteristic does not result in any clearly\nfaster Dst* decrease in the first hours following storm onset\nas far as the measured Dst* is concerned (Figure 3d). The\nmodeledDst* depends directly on this parameter (VBz or Ey),\nhowever, and it therefore decreases slightly faster for the\nhorizontal\/southward IMF case. As discussed for CME-\ndriven storms in the previous section, a possible misrepre-\nsentation of the magnetopause current system correction may\nbe indicated in Figure 3d as the slight difference between the\nmodeled and observedDst* in the immediate prestorm hours.\n[25] In terms of the general trends, for CIR-driven storms\nthe model Dst* again globally underestimates the decrease\nin measured Dst* when the IMF has been northward in the\n6 hours preceding storm onset. Compared to the model\npredictions, storms with preceding northward IMF intervals\nare stronger than those without (Figure 3d). The difference\nbetween the model and observations is even more significant\nthan for the case of CME-driven storms when compared to\nthe statistical error bars. The average underestimation is more\nthan 10 nT for the northward IMF case a few hours after\nstorm onset. It corresponds to \t20% of the average Dst* at\nthis time. This separate study of CIR-driven storms thus\nconfirms the global underestimation of the Dst* magnitude\nFigure 3. Superposed epoch time series of solar wind and\nmagnetospheric data for the set of 38 CIR-driven storms. The\nresults for the 24 (14) events preceded by southward\/\nhorizontal (northward) IMF (see text for definitions) are\nshown with the black (red) lines. This figure is in the same\nformat as Figure 2.\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n6 of 10\nA09208\nby the model when the IMF has been northward for a\nsubstantial interval before storm onset.\n[26] We performed similar analyses using different criteria\nfor the selection of northward IMF cases. The superposed\nepoch results for both CMEs and CIRs show a consistently\nlarger Dst* magnitude than the model when one requires at\nleast 3 and 4 hours of preceding northward IMF. Other\nanalyses based on the IMF direction over the 12 hours\npreceding storm onset also confirmed this trend. This trend\nholds true when other sensible criteria are used for the\ndefinition of northward and horizontal\/southward IMF cases.\n[27] This underestimation of storm strength by the model\nmay be attributed to additional physical processes not taken\ninto account in the model formulation. We propose that such\nan additional coupling mechanism may be the occurrence of\na preconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward\nIMF through the formation of a cold, dense plasma sheet in\nthe midtail of the magnetosphere. To test this hypothesis, we\nstudy Los Alamos geosynchronous data for both sets of\nevents in the next section. Geosynchronous spacecraft have\npreviously been shown to constitute goodmonitors of plasma\nsheet access to the inner magnetosphere [Korth et al., 1999;\nThomsen et al., 2003; Denton et al., 2005; Lavraud et al.,\n2005b].\n3.4. Geosynchronous Data and Combined Results\n[28] Figure 4 shows superposed epoch results for the\ncombined set of CME- and CIR-driven storms, zoomed on\nthe early storm main phase. The black and red curves (apart\nfrom Figure 4c) correspond to data from the set of events\ndefined as horizontal\/southward and northward IMF cases,\nrespectively (Tables 1 and 2). Figures 4a and 4b show the ion\ndensity and temperature measured onboard Los Alamos\ngeosynchronous spacecraft, sorted by preceding southward\/\nhorizontal (black) and northward (red) IMF. All available\nmeasurements during the time intervals of interest in the\nnightside region (1800\u20130600 LT) of geosynchronous orbit\nare used; the trends are similar when only considering\nmeasurements closer to midnight, but the statistics decrease.\nFigure 4c shows the superposed epoch averages of the\nmeasured (solid lines) and modeled (dashed lines) Dst* for\nall storms, without sorting by preceding IMF. Figure 4d\nshows the superposed epoch averages of the measured (solid\nlines) and modeled (dashed lines) Dst*, sorted by preceding\nsouthward\/horizontal (black) and northward (red) IMF.\nFigure 4e shows the superposed epoch averages of the\ndifference between the measured and modeled Dst*, sorted\nby preceding southward\/horizontal (black) and northward\n(red) IMF, together with that for all events, i.e., without\nsorting by preceding IMF (dotted black line). Figure 4f shows\nthe superposed epoch averages for the Kp index, sorted by\npreceding southward\/horizontal (black) and northward\n(red) IMF. Apart from 14 CIRs that occurred in the 1970s\n(Table 2), there are typically several geosynchronous space-\ncraft operative and contributing to the averages of Figures 4a\nand 4b. Figures 4c\u20134f show the results for all CMEs and\nCIRs, but those trends hold if the 14 CIRs from the 1970s are\ntaken out of the averages.\n[29] The global trends in the measured and modeled Dst*\nfor the combined set of events follow those from the separate\nsets discussed earlier. Figure 4 shows that the model slightly\nunderestimates storm strength when all events are taken into\nFigure 4. Superposed epoch time series of magnetospheric\nindices and geosynchronous data from the Los Alamos\nplasma instruments for the combined CME- and CIR-driven\nstorms. The Los Alamos geosynchronous superposed time\nseries are derived from the nightside measurements, as\nexplained in the text. These data only come from the 84 (out\nof 98) events which occurred during the 1994\u20132003 period\nwhen the spacecraft were operative. The total set of 98 storms\n(60 CME and 38 CIR) is used for the indices (Dst*, Dst*\nmodel and Kp) superposed time series. The results are\nseparately shown for events preceded by southward\/\nhorizontal (black) and northward (red) IMF (see text for\ndefinitions), apart from Figure 4c that shows the Dst* traces\nfor all events.

Error bars show the mean absolute\ndeviation of the mean.\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n7 of 10\nA09208\naccount (Figure 4c) and that in the cases preceded by\nsouthward\/horizontal IMF the model better reproduces the\nmeasured Dst* (Figure 4d). By contrast, the model under-\nestimates even more the strength of storms preceded by\nnorthward IMF, which is made clear in Figure 4e were the\ndifference between measured and modeled Dst* are shown.\nThe reason why the model underestimates the strength of\nstorms when all events are taken into account is unclear. It\nmay come from the fact that the model of O\u2019Brien and\nMcPherron [2000] was not constructed based on the present\nset of storms. In a relative sense, however, it is clear that the\nmodel Dst* globally tends to underestimate the ring current\nstrength during the main phase of storms that have been\npreceded by a substantial interval of northward IMF. Note\nthat we have performed this analysis using start times, for\nintegration of the Burton formula, closer to the storm onset\ntime (i.e., less than 12 hours), and the results confirmed the\nrelative underestimation (by similar amounts) of the storm\nstrength for events preceded by northward IMF. The under-\nestimation attains\t5\u201310 nTwhich is\t10\u201320% of the Dst*\nvalue at that time. For isolated cases with strong and\nsustained northward IMF preceding the storm, such as for\nthe north-south polarity magnetic cloud of 25 June 1998 in\nFigure 1, the underestimation may even be greater (e.g.,\n30%). Although the trend observed in the present study\nappears systematic (observed for different sets of events),\nthe error bars associated with them are of the order of the\ndifference itself. Therefore additional studies will be required\nto further confirm and constrain this tendency when larger\nCME and CIR sets are available.\n[30] Los Alamos data in Figures 4a and 4b show a clear\ntendency for the plasma sheet accessing geosynchronous\norbit in the midnight sector around storm onset to have a\nmuch larger density and a slightly lower temperature in the\ncase of storms preceded by intervals of northward IMF than\nin the case of storms preceded by horizontal\/southward\nIMF. This ensemble of results is compatible with the\nhypothesis that a preceding northward IMF interval leads\nto the formation of a cold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS),\nwhich in turn is pushed inward by the increased convection\nat storm onset. This larger plasma sheet density seems to\nlead to a larger ring current than a more tenuous plasma\nsheet for similar solar wind driving conditions (within error\nuncertainties), as was suggested in the study by Thomsen et\nal. [1998] and several simulation studies [Jordanova et al.,\n1998; Kozyra et al., 1998]. The colder nature of the plasma\nsheet also has a potential geoeffective role, as colder plasma\ncan be convected further inward than hot plasma that cur-\nvature and gradient drifts more readily out of the ring cur-\nrent region [Ebihara and Ejiri, 2000].\n3.5. Discussion\n[31] In this section, we discuss the results and associated\npotential limiting factors in relation with the precondition-\ning mechanism presented in this paper. These pertain to\n(1) limitations due to statistical aspects and data availability,\n(2) the effects from the magnetopause current system and\nsolar wind dynamic pressure, (3) the contribution of iono-\nspheric plasma to the ring current, (4) the removal\/expulsion\nof part of the plasma sheet from the magnetotail at storm\nonset, and (5) the mass loading of dayside reconnection (and\nconvection) owing to the formation of a plasmasphere under\nnorthward IMF.\n[32] The survey of the individual events constituting the\ndata set used in this study revealed that a majority of CMEs\nand CIRs are preceded by relatively variable conditions,\nincluding that in magnetic field direction. To address the\ntopic of this paper, we have used the criteria which we\nthought most sensible (see section 3.2). However, the effects\nof variable IMF direction, in particular, on the formation of\nthe cold, dense plasma sheet could not be assessed thoroughly.\nIn the future, this mechanism ought to be studied by use of\nmore extended data sets, out of which significant lists of\nevents with preceding steady conditions may be identified;\ni.e., in order to fully isolate the effect sought in the present\npaper.\n[33] An interesting result regarding the Burton formula-\ntion is seen in all figures plotting the modeled and observed\npressure-corrected Dst*. It appears that prior to the storm,\nthe pressure correction is not sufficient to account for the\nmeasured Dst*, and thus the measured values in all cases lie\nabove the modeled ones. This discrepancy is quickly\nrecovered as the activity increases at storm onset. As one\ninterpretation, it is noted that Siscoe et al. [2005] recently\ndiscussed the dependence of the pressure correction on the\ndriving electric field. They concluded that the correction is\nlargest for lowest levels of the driving electric field and goes\nto almost zero as the driving electric field reaches values\nclose to 10 mV\/m. If such a VBz dependence was adopted,\nthis would tend to reduce the pressure correction after the\nstorm onset. However, as the changes to the model and\nobservations would be similar in both preconditioning\ncases, it appears that our conclusions would remain un-\nchanged. Also, concerning the Burton formulation, we wish\nto point out that the parameterization performed by O\u2019Brien\nand McPherron [2000] was made statistically using data\nfrom both quiet and active times.\n[34] Large ring current development is associated with\nlarge-scale magnetospheric and ionospheric disturbances.\nDuring such active times, the ionosphere supplies the\nplasma sheet with large amounts of material, out of which\nO+ ions have been shown to contribute most [e.g., Young et\nal., 1982; Lennartsson, 1995; Nose\u00b4 et al., 2003]. Therefore,\nalthough the solar wind is known to be an important source\nof plasma for the plasma sheet (and in turn the ring current),\nthe contribution of O+ ions to the plasma sheet density and\nto the ring current strength has been shown to be important\n(and sometimes dominant) [Hamilton et al., 1988; Daglis et\nal., 1993; Daglis, 1997]. Therefore a potential masking\nfactor to the preconditioning mechanism discussed here\ncomes from the fact that the solar wind (implying the cold,\ndense plasma sheet) is not the sole source of material for the\nring current. However, the timings of the two effects are\ndifferent: while the preconditioning takes place during the\nhours prior to the onset, and hence affects the storm early\nmain phase, the increase in the ionospheric outflow and\nespecially oxygen outflow is enhanced only as the level of\nactivity increases toward the peak of the main phase. Thus,\neven assuming that Dst carries a signature from the iono-\nspheric outflows, the conclusions about the preconditioning\neffect discussed here remain unchanged.\n[35] The onset of enhanced convection that transports the\nplasma sheet toward geosynchronous orbit and the ring\nA09208 LAVRAUD ET AL.: MAGNETOSPHERE PRECONDITIONING\n8 of 10\nA09208\ncurrent also leads to magnetic reconnection in the midtail,\nwhich would result in the (tailward) expulsion of the plasma\nsheet located tailward of the reconnection line. Thus, even\nwhen preconditioning by northward IMF occurs, only a\nlimited portion of the tail CDPS is transported to the inner\nmagnetosphere. In other words, the denser plasma of the\nCDPS may constitute a source for the ring current only in the\nearly stage of the main phase, after which it may be replaced\nby fresh plasma that has different characteristics. Substorms\nor other processes associated with midtail reconnection\nwould thus cut the supply of cold and dense plasma (CDPS)\nto the inner magnetosphere and therefore limit the effects of\nthis preconditioning mechanism. From Figure 4a denser\nplasma sheet is detected at geosynchronous orbit for\n2\u20134 hours following storm onset in the northward IMF case.\nThis constitutes a lower timescale limit to the influence of the\nCDPS on the ring current, which is located deeper inside\ngeosynchronous orbit. Exact timescales for this process will\nbe determined in future work from comparisons with ring\ncurrent models.\n[36] Finally, recent works have suggested [Borovsky and\nSteinberg, 2006; Borovsky and Denton, 2006] that the\nformation of a dense plasmasphere during northward IMF\nmay in turn lower the dayside reconnection rate (e.g., as\nindicated by the Polar Cap Index), by decreasing the Alfve\u00b4n\nspeed near the reconnection site, after an increase in\nconvection has led to the formation of a plasmaspheric\nplume on the dayside. This scenario also constitutes a\npreconditioning of the magnetosphere under northward\nIMF (quiet conditions are also conducive to the formation\nof a plasmasphere). If one presumes that dayside reconnec-\ntion influences global convection, and indirectly the\nstrength of storms, this mechanism would be counteracting\nthe preconditioning mechanism due to the formation of a\ncold, dense plasma sheet (CDPS). However, in the context of\nthe present study, the fact that the Kp values for northward\nand southward\/horizontal IMF cases in Figure 4f closely\nfollow each other suggests that the present results (for our set\nof events) are independent of this other mechanism.\n4. Conclusion\n[37] We have studied the possible preconditioning effect\nof the IMF history on the geoeffectiveness of both CMEs\n(60 events) and CIRs (38 events). We have analyzed the\nmagnetospheric response to those two types of solar wind\nstructures (1) in terms of both measured and modeled Dst*\nindex and (2) in terms of the associated geosynchronous\nobservations of the density and temperature of the plasma\nsheet accessing the inner magnetosphere at storm onset. We\nfirst focused on the difference between measured and mod-\neled [Wang et al., 2003] Dst* signatures during those events.\nWe have shown that, for both cases separately as well as\ncombined, the model Dst* tends to underestimate the actual\nstorm strength for events that are preceded by northward IMF\nintervals. Although the differences observed are of the order\nof the error bars, this trend was confirmed separately for the\ntwo sets of storms, i.e., CME- and CIR-driven storms. The\naverage underestimation is of the order of 5\u201310 nT, which\ncorresponds to 10\u201320% of the average Dst* value for these\nevents. This result suggests that, for similar solar wind\nelectric field and dynamic pressure profiles, CME or CIR\nstructures that are preceded by strongly northward IMF are\nmore geoeffective than those preceded by horizontal\/south-\nward IMF. An example is the storm driven by the north-south\npolarity magnetic cloud on 25 June 1998, which shows an\nunderestimation of \t30% in the magnitude of Dst*.\n[38] We further analyzed the available Los Alamos geo-\nsynchronous data for the events under consideration and\ndemonstrated that the plasma sheet density and temperature\nin the midnight sector around storm onset are signifi-\ncantly larger and slightly lower, respectively, for the events\npreceded by northward IMF intervals. This fact shows the\npresence of a colder and denser plasma sheet before storm\nonset in the midtail region and formed under the prevailing\nnorthward IMF conditions. This cold, dense plasma sheet\napparently is conducive of an increased ring current owing to\npotentially both its larger density and colder nature. The\nformation of a cold, dense plasma sheet under northward IMF\nthus seems to precondition the magnetosphere by leading to\nthe creation of a stronger ring current during the early main\nphase of the ensuing storm.\n[39] These results highlight the necessity for further studies\nof this, as well as other, potential preconditioning processes.\nFuture models need to better represent the effects of such pre-\nconditioning mechanisms through the addition of appropriate\nformulations in the Dst models. The current number of CME\nand CIR events of substantial strength and with good solar\nwind data coverage (and steady preceding conditions) may not\nbe extensive enough to perform such a task. However, the fact\nthat north-south polarity magnetic clouds are expected to\nbecome prevalent during solar cycle 24 starting in 2007\n[Mulligan et al., 1998; Li and Luhmann, 2004] may enable\nus (1) to further confirm, (2) to better quantify this mecha-\nnism, and (3) to potentially implement it in more elaborate\nschemes [e.g., Temerin and Li, 2002] of Dst prediction.\n[40] Acknowledgments.
