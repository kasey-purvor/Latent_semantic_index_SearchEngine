A high frequency (HF) ionospheric modification\nexperiment was carried out between 25 September and 8 Oc-\ntober 2004, using the EISCAT HF transmitter located near\nTroms\u00f8, Norway. During this experiment the spectra of the\nstimulated HF sideband waves (stimulated electromagnetic\nemission or SEE) induced by the HF pump were observed\nusing an interferometer consisting of three spaced receiving\nantennas with baselines both along and perpendicular to the\nmeridian, and a multi-channel coherent receiver, installed in\nthe vicinity of the HF facility. The transmitter operated at\n4040 kHz and its antenna beam was scanned to angles of 0\u25e6,\n7\u25e6, 14\u25e6, and 21\u25e6 south from vertical, pausing 4 min at each\nposition. This paper focuses on features of the downshifted\npeak (DP) emission, which has not been as thoroughly stud-\nied as many of the other SEE spectral features observable\nwithin the EISCAT pump frequency range. It was found\nthat the signal-weighted direction of the DP source region\nremained within 5\u25e6 of magnetic zenith as the HF beam was\ntilted between 0 and 21\u25e6 south of vertical.\nKeywords.

Commonly used terms in\nthe Russian literature are artificial ionospheric radiation or\nradio emission.\nDiscovered at Troms\u00f8 in 1981 (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1982), SEE is\na complex phenomenon that has close connections to stri-\nations and turbulent processes in the ionosphere (Leyser,\n2001). SEE may be a consequence of excited Langmuir\nwaves that convert to HF electromagnetic waves by scat-\ntering off low or zero frequency electrostatic waves. These\nelectromagnetic waves may then propagate out of the modi-\nfied ionosphere and be observed on the ground. They appear\nas sidebands of the ionospherically-reflected pump wave,\nreaching an intensity of 50 to 75 dB below the magnitude of\nthe reflected pump and several tens of dB above the back-\nground noise level. The pump frequency f0 is in the HF\nband, i.e. typically a few MHz and near the electron plasma\nfrequency fp in the pump-plasma interaction region. SEE\ncommonly covers a spectral width of the order of 100 kHz,\nor 1f\/f0\u22480.02, around the ionospherically-reflected pump\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1820 E. D. Tereshchenko: Directional features of the downshifted peak\nwave, but it is also observed at harmonics and sub-harmonics\nof f0 (Derblom et al., 1989). SEE has been detected for\nf0 ranging at least from 2.8 to 9.4 MHz (Leyser, 2001),\ntherefore occurring at much higher frequencies than the HF\npump-excited secondary electromagnetic radiation found in\nthe VLF, ELF, and ULF bands (Barr, 1998). On the other\nhand, SEE occurs at much lower frequencies than the elec-\ntromagnetic emissions at optical frequencies that are studied\nin experiments of HF pump-enhanced airglow (Bernhardt et\nal., 1989). Some SEE features have been linked to paramet-\nric interactions involving electromagnetic waves, Langmuir\nwaves, and ion-acoustic waves (Stubbe et al., 1984).\nThe geomagnetic field plays a dominant role in SEE, as\nevidenced by the morphology of the SEE spectrum, which\ndepends dramatically on the proximity of the HF pump fre-\nquency to a harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency\n(Honary et al., 1999; Frolov et al., 2001). These proper-\nties suggest that features in the SEE spectrum should also\ndepend on geomagnetic aspect angle (Isham et al., 2005), a\ntopic that is investigated in this report. SEE is also known\nto be sensitive to pump duty cycle, power, and to pumping\nby additional waves (Leyser, 2001). It develops on a wide\nrange of time scales, from under a millisecond to tens of sec-\nonds for a given pump power, encompassing over four or-\nders of magnitude in time (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1983). Physically,\nthis range spans ponderomotive to thermal\/collisional time\nscales, with the thermal processes creating long-time struc-\nturing of the magnetized plasma in which the ponderomotive\nprocesses continue to operate. These features make SEE an\nimportant tool for the study of HF radiowave pump-induced\nprocesses in the ionosphere. Knowledge gained in the study\nof artificially stimulated radio emissions may also be of inter-\nest for comparison with observations of radio emissions from\nnaturally-driven plasma turbulence processes known to occur\nin planetary atmospheres, in the solar corona, and which in\nall likelihood occur throughout the plasma universe.\n1.2 Downshifted peak\nA distinctive feature of the steady-state SEE spectrum is the\ndownshifted peak (DP), a narrow and normally strong emis-\nsion located at 1f = 1fDP = \u2013(f \u2013f0)\u22481 to 3 kHz below the\npump frequency f0 and several kHz above the commonly-\nobserved downshifted maximum (DM) feature. The DP\nmay be found superimposed on the slow narrow continuum\n(SNC), which typically extends 5 to 20 kHz below and often\nsome kilohertz above f0 (Stubbe et al., 1984, 1994; Stubbe\nand Kopka, 1990).\nThe DP is very sensitive to small changes in f0 and has\nbeen observed only for f0 near nf ce, where fce is the elec-\ntron gyrofrequency and n=3, 4, or 5 (Stubbe and Kopka,\n1990; Stubbe et al., 1994). The strongest DP emissions have\nbeen observed in experiments at Troms\u00f8 for f0=4.04 MHz,\nwhich is near 3fce (see Fig. 1), but the DP has also been\nseen at n=4 and 5 (Stubbe and Kopka, 1990). Emissions\nresembling the DP have been recorded in experiments at\nArecibo for f0=5.10 MHz (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1989) and at HIPAS\nfor f0=3.349 MHz (Armstrong et al., 1990). The DP has\nsometimes been seen along with one or two cascade lines\nat frequency offsets downshifted from the pump at multiples\nof the DP offset frequency (Leyser et al., 1990). In addition,\na weak upshifted peak (UP), with absolute frequency offset\nclose to that of the DP, has been observed near 3fce (Stubbe\net al., 1984; Leyser, 2001). The DP has not been as thor-\noughly studied as many of the other SEE spectral features\n(Leyser et al., 2001).\n2 Technique and experiment description\nThis ionospheric modification experiment discussed here\nwas carried out using the powerful HF transmitter at Ram-\nfjordmoen near Troms\u00f8, Norway (69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E, L=6.2,\nmagnetic dip angle 78\u25e6) and a multi-channel digital receiv-\ning system designed for high-resolution interferometric mea-\nsurements of radio signals (Isham et al., 2005). A technical\ndescription of the HF transmitter facility and its parameters\ncan be found in Rietveld et al. (1993). In brief, the facility\nis capable of transmitting at frequencies between 3.85 and\n8 MHz with a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of\nup to either 300 MW or 1.2 MW (peak and CW), depending\non the antenna array employed. Linearly or circularly polar-\nized waves in either ordinary or extraordinary mode can be\ntransmitted.\nSEE was discovered and has most often been measured\nusing a spectrum analyzer connected to an HF receiving an-\ntenna (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1982). Although spectrum analyzers\nprovide only moderate (several-second) time resolution, they\nhave a large 120-dB or greater dynamic range, which is use-\nful for detecting weak SEE signals lying near the ionospher-\nically reflected (and possibly ground-path-propagated) pump\nwave, which may have 100 dB greater power than the SEE\nsidebands. For greater time resolution, digital systems may\nbe used, and, for interferometry, digital recording of the raw\ndata is a great advantage. Although they provide the best pos-\nsible time resolution, the dynamic range of digital systems is\nlimited by the number of bits available in their analog-to-\ndigital converters (ADCs). Current digital systems typically\nuse 14-bit ADCs, which provide 78 dB of dynamic range. An\nadditional 20 or more dB can be obtained through the use of\na filter to notch out the pump frequency.\nFor the interferometric SEE observations described here,\na coherent four-channel 14-bit digital receiver was con-\nstructed by the Polar Geophysical Institute in Murmansk,\nRussia. The receive frequency is tunable between 1.5 and\n32 MHz, and notch filters at 4040.0, 4544.0, 4912.8, 5423.0,\nand 5752.0 kHz are available for use with the corresponding\npump frequencies. The attenuation of the notch filters at their\ncenter frequencies is not less than 55 dB.\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1819\u20131827, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1819\/2006\/\nE. D. Tereshchenko: Directional features of the downshifted peak 1821\nFig. 1. The behaviour of the downshifted peak (DP) near the third gyroharmonic. Note that the frequency scale of the plots is limited to just\nto a few kHz in width. The plot was made using data obtained by the Troms\u00f8 HF facility in November 1989. Reproduced from Stubbe and\nHagfors (1997).\nThe intermediate frequency (IF) output of each channel\nis centered at 2450 kHz and is about 300 kHz in bandwidth.\nSwitching the IF band center into a given pump position is\nachieved by the internal frequency synthesizer controlled by\na computer. The four separate coherent channels can be fed\neither by a stable local or external oscillator. After the IF\nstage the signals enter the 14-bit ADC and the digital down\nconverter (DDC) modules. Each of the modules has two co-\nherent channels. The data acquisition is performed at the\nsampling rate of 60 million real samples per second per chan-\nnel. After a 32-times decimation in the DDC modules the re-\nsulting sampling frequency is 1.875 MHz. During a 4-s data\nrecording cycle the I and Q components from each channel\nare collected into memory at a rate of 30 MB\/s, then during\nabout 2.5 additional seconds the data are stored to a computer\nhard disk.\nFor the simplest interferometric observations, two of the\nchannels can be connected to two simple HF dipoles. If two\ncrossed dipoles are available, the four individual elements\ncan be connected to the four receiver channels. Alterna-\ntively, more complicated antenna geometries could make use\nof four spaced linear dipoles connected to the four channels.\nAlthough the receiving system currently has four coherent\nchannels, it may be expanded to up to eight channels, and in\nthat case four crossed dipoles or eight simple dipoles could\nbe used.\nSince raw voltage samples are recorded, the phase angle\nbetween the channels may be varied to any desired value,\nthus allowing the interference pattern of the antennas to be\nscanned, for example, between vertical and field aligned, as-\nsuming appropriate placement of the SEE receiving anten-\nnas. If in doing so the relative or absolute strengths of the\nSEE features are seen to vary with angle, the results may be\ncompared to radar, optical, and other measurements, and to\ntheoretical and modeling results, with the goal of determin-\ning the relative importance and functions of the various in-\nteraction processes in producing HF pump-induced phenom-\nena. Alternatively, the cross phase angle between channel\npairs may be computed and converted to a direction of ar-\nrival, which is the method used for the results presented here.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1819\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 1819\u20131827, 2006\n1822 E. D. Tereshchenko: Directional features of the downshifted peak\nFig. 2. Antenna layout in the SEE experiment.\nThe interferometer antenna layout is shown in Fig. 2. The\ngeographical coordinates of the antenna field are 69.63\u25e6 N\nand 19.52\u25e6 E, located 12.8 km east northeast of the HF trans-\nmitter. The antennas are linearly-polarized 27.43-m-long\nfolded dipoles, tuned to 54.86-m wavelength or 5.468-MHz\ncenter frequency. The dipoles were mounted horizontally\napproximately 4.5 m above the ground with the axes in the\neast-west direction; the dipole pattern thus had \u20133-dB points\nat zenith angles of about \u00b130\u25e6 in the east-west direction and\n\u00b145\u25e6 north-south. These figures determine the field-of-view\nof the instrument. Within the band of available HF pump fre-\nquencies (about 4 to 8 MHz, corresponding to wavelengths\nof 75 to 37.5 m), the dipole pattern changes very little; in ad-\ndition, these figures are not sensitive to the exact mounting\nheight above the ground.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the antenna baselines were arranged in\nthe north-south direction with 55.6-m spacing and in the east-\nwest direction with 50.2-m spacing. The spacing of about\n50 m between antenna pairs means that a desired 1\u25e6 precision\nin direction of arrival requires the error in phase difference\nbetween antennas to be less than 4.2\u25e6 for 4 MHz (the lowest\npump frequency) and less than 8.4\u25e6 for 8 MHz (the highest\npump frequency). As can be seen in the phase data shown\nin Fig. 7 below, these error levels, and thus the goal of 1\u25e6\nprecision, are relatively easily achieved. The antenna spacing\nalso means that direction of arrival cannot alias (i.e. phase\ndifference >360\u25e6) at 4 MHz. Aliasing can occur at 48.6\u25e6\nfrom zenith at 8 MHz, but this is well beyond what we expect\nto see based on the beamwidth and pointing angles of the\nHF pump beam. The cable lengths from the antennas to the\nreceiver are equal.\nHere we present some results from SEE measurements\nperformed on 6 October 2004 between 15:30 and 15:46 UT.\nThe beam of the HF facility was scanned in 7\u25e6 steps be-\ntween the vertical position and 21\u25e6 south. The transmitter\nwas operated at 4040 kHz using 12 transmitters on array 2\nFig. 3.

The center of\nthe beam, which is 13.6\u25e6 wide at half power, does not quite reach\nfield-aligned because of the orientation of the HF antenna along\ngeographic north.\nresulting in about 164 MW ERP with 14\u25e6 3-dB full beam\nwidth, and with a scanning cycle of 4 min on each posi-\ntion: 0\u25e6 pointing at 15:30 UT, 7\u25e6 south at 15:34 UT, 14\u25e6\nsouth at 15:38 UT, and 21\u25e6 south at 15:42 UT. The trans-\nmitter modulation was 1536 ms on every 4 s, continuously\nrepeated. Just before, from 15:26 to 15:30 UT, the HF pump\nhad been turned off, and prior to that it had been transmitting\nfor 384 ms every 4 s. Figure 3 shows the angle between the\ndirection of the HF antenna beam and the geomagnetic field\nfor the above-mentioned beam positions at the ionospheric\naltitude of 250 km, which corresponds to the height of the\npump interaction region as determined from ionosonde data.\nThe procedure used to study the DP using the raw data is\nas follows. Raw data (4-s SEE voltage sample) records were\nfirst divided into 0.28-s non-overlapping intervals. Intervals\nlying completely within a 1.536-s pump-on pulse were then\nused to calculate the coherence matrix. Each selected interval\nwas divided into 16 17.5-ms non-overlapping segments and\nthe power spectra, coherence (normalized cross spectra) and\n(cross-phase) spectra were calculated and then averaged for\n0.28-s in order to decrease the incoherent noise level. All ele-\nments of the coherence matrix were then calculated (Marple,\n1987). The frequency resolution of the measured spectra is\nthus (17.5 ms)\u22121 or \u223c57 Hz. In order to confidently deter-\nmine the source locations of the DP component, we then se-\nlected only measurements having high coherence (near to 1)\nat the frequency of the DP maximum level (4038.2 kHz).\nThe top panels of Fig. 4 show the unnormalized coherence\ncurves computed using data from receiver channels 1 and 2\n(top left panel) and 2 and 3 (top right panel) with notch fil-\nters at 4040 kHz and a signal provided by a wide-band noise\nAnn.

The bottom panels of Fig. 4 show correspond-\ning stimulated emission spectra measured 6.5 min after the\npump on time at 15:30 UT on 6 October 2004. The pump\nfrequency peak is strongly attenuated by the notch filters but\nis still visible as a spike in the central spectral gap which has\na width corresponding to the narrow bandwidth of the notch\nfilter. The DP component is clearly observed in the spectra\nat 4038.2 kHz, to the left of the 4040.0-kHz pump. Taking\ninto account the frequency response of the notch filters (top\npanels), it can be seen that the filters do not affect the DP\ncomponent because the DP is observed 1.8 kHz below the\npump frequency while the lower cut-off of the notch filters is\nsignificantly higher in frequency.\n3 Results\nThe results of the data processing described in Sect. 2 are\npresented below. Figure 5 shows the SEE power spectral\ndensities (PSD, in dB) above the noise level (0 dB) for the\nthree antennas (north, south, and west \u2013 see Fig. 3) at pump\ntimes (from top to bottom) of 2.5, 6.5, 10.5, and 14.5 min\nfrom 15:30 UT and pump antenna beam directions (from top\nto bottom) of 0\u25e6, 7\u25e6, 14\u25e6, and 21\u25e6 south. The pump fre-\nquency was 4040 kHz. As described in the previous section,\nthe pump peak is greatly attenuated by the notch filters. The\nDP component is clearly observed in the spectra just to the\nleft of the pump. The DM and its harmonic, the 2DM, are\nthe second and third peaks to the left of the pump. An under-\nlying narrow continuum (NC) can also be seen, occupying\nthe frequencies between 4025 and 4045 kHz (on both sides\nof the pump). Although in Fig. 5 the DP is seen to be super-\nimposed on what appears to be a fairly substantial NC, the\npower density is plotted on a log scale and it can be seen that\nthe DP is responsible for most of the signal measured near\nthe peak of the DP enhancement.\nFigure 6 shows the time variation of the power spectral\ndensity of the SEE DP component for the three antennas.\nThe DP is located at 4038.2 kHz (1.8 kHz below the pump\nfrequency). It can be seen that at 15:30 UT (at 0 min), and at\neach on time thereafter, the DP component typically grows\nfor 1 to 2 min, then its strength becomes stable for each an-\ntenna position. However, the level of the DP strength varies\nfor different pump beam angles. The maximum level of the\nDP was observed for 7\u25e6 south. A significant part of de-\ncrease in amplitude at the 21\u25e6 pump angle is likely due to the\ndownward reflection of main part of the pump beam before\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1819\/2006\/ Ann.

The beam direction is degrees south of vertical.\nreaching the upper-hybrid level, where SEE is thought to be\ngenerated, thus reducing the possibility for SEE excitation.\nThe noise values in the gaps between the 1.536-s pump-on\nperiods are not shown in the figure.\nFigure 7 shows the time variations of the phase difference\nangles of the SEE DP component for the north-south (left\nplot) and east-west (right plot) antenna pairs, while Fig. 8 il-\nlustrates the source locations of the DP component estimated\nfrom the phase difference angles (dots) along with contours\nof the angle between the beam direction and the geomag-\nnetic field at 250 km (solid lines). Squares show the mean\npositions of the DP for each of the HF beam directions. Data\nfor the final 3 min of each 4-min beam position dwell period\nis shown in the figure. It is interesting that the source region\nfor pump pointing near magnetic field-aligned (14\u25e6 south)\nappears to be offset towards the east by approximately 1.5\u25e6\nrelative to the other positions. This could point to an interest-\ning feature of the DP spatial emission pattern that depends on\nthe maximum pump power density being near field-aligned.\nHowever, thus far this is the only data showing either the\npresence or absence of this effect.\nSEE measurements at 4.04 MHz were performed for a to-\ntal of 4.5 h spanning 6 days in different modes of the HF\npump. The 6 October was a good day on which 16 scans\nusing 4 different heater pulse durations over an interval of\nnearly 2 h were performed. Although in the paper we present\nonly the longest pump pulse duration variant, the DP was\nalso seen in 12 other scans using shorter pulse durations.\nIn order to interpret the source directions properly, we\nshould consider how the pump beam changes with pointing\nangle. In Table 1 are presented the calculated antenna gains\nin the main beam directions and the gains in the direction\nthat the DP was found to be strongest for each of the pump\nscan directions. The results suggest that the \u201cdegradation\u201d of\nthe pump beam as it was tilted south is not significant. The\nfigures seem to support the idea that the movement of the DP\nposition was due to the weighting by the pump power pat-\ntern, i.e. a convolution of where the DP \u201cwants\u201d to be and\nthe pump power pattern.\nAnn.

The\nrelative and absolute strengths of stimulated electromagnetic\nemission features induced by a powerful HF pump wave\nwere recorded in the vicinity of the HF transmitter by com-\nbining three receiving antennas as two interferometer pairs,\nin the meridional and latitudinal directions, using a multi-\nchannel coherent raw data digital receiver. The HF transmit-\nter operated at 4040 kHz in a repeating pattern of 1536-ms-on\nevery 4 s, and its antenna beam was scanned at 0\u25e6, 7\u25e6, 14\u25e6,\nand 21\u25e6 south from vertical, beginning a new position every\n4 min. In order to increase the dynamic range of the receiv-\ning system the pump frequency was attenuated through the\nuse of a notch filter. Due to its narrow frequency bandwidth,\nthe filter did not obscure the downshifted peak (DP) compo-\nnent, and the dependence of the location of the DP emission\nregion on the aspect angle of the HF pump wave has been\npresented.\nWhile the position of the DP component of the SEE spec-\ntrum did shift somewhat in response to the changing angle of\nthe HF pump beam, its position remained between 2.5\u25e6 north\nand 5\u25e6 south of the magnetic zenith for the entire 21\u25e6 range of\nbeam positions, with the peak intensity occurring between 1\u25e6\nand 2\u25e6 south, corresponding to 7\u25e6 south pump beam pointing.\nThis suggests that the DP may have a \u201cpreferred\u201d position,\nperhaps just south of field-aligned, which shifts in response\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1819\/2006\/ Ann.

The mea-\nsured angles, however, are intensity-weighted averages over\nthe total DP emission region, so the DP source region may\nin fact be significantly extended in solid angle. In addition,\nthere is a 1.5\u25e6 eastward offset of the weighted DP source re-\ngion position for pump pointing near magnetic field-aligned\n(14\u25e6 south) as compared to the other pump beam positions.\nThis could point to an interesting feature of the DP spatial\nemission pattern that depends on the maximum pump power\ndensity being near field-aligned.
