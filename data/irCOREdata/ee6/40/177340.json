INTRODUCTION \nRemote control of an excavator plays a significant role \nin real-life applications, such as nuclear decommissioning, \nbuilding demolition, military operations and rescue \nmissions, etc. The advantage of remote control is that it \nallows the operator to control the machine in a remote safe \nenvironment via the wired\/wireless network. In order to \ncarry out a specific task, there are two subtasks for an \nexcavator. Firstly, the excavator has to find a feasible path \nfrom its initial location to the destination. Secondly, a \nrobust control approach has to be designed to execute the \ndesired excavation tasks. According to these requirements, \nwe proposed a framework of remote control of an \nexcavator in [1].  This paper further expands the work \nconducted in [1] in the following aspects: 1) modelling of \nthe excavator base; 2) control of the excavator base; 3) \nrobust control of the excavator arm; 4) remote control of \nthe excavator base. \nBased on the earlier work, implementation of a \nremote-control excavator mainly focused on modelling \nand control of the machine. The modelling work includes \nkinematic [2] and dynamic [3] modelling, modelling of \ninteraction between the machine and the environment [4] \nand parameter identification [5][6][7]. The key reason for \nmodelling and parameter identification during the digging \noperation is to provide online parameters for the real-time \nmonitoring and remote control. In [5], a novel approach \nfor experimental determination of the joint parameters and \nfriction coefficients was developed on the excavator arm. \nZweiri et al. [6] presented another robust, fast, and simple \ntechnique for the experimental identification of the joint \nparameters and friction coefficients of a full-scale \nexcavator arm. Furthermore, an online soil parameter \nestimation scheme was proposed in [7]. During the earlier \nstage of excavation control, impedance control was \nconsidered as a prevalent robust control approach to \nachieve compliant motion in contact tasks. In [8], a \nposition-based impedance controller was presented on \nvarious contact experiments by using an instrumented \nmini-excavator. Details of robust impedance control for a \nhydraulic excavator have been presented in [9][10].  \nIn contrast to control of the excavator arm, motion \ncontrol and path planning for the excavator base have also \nbeen studied in a number of research papers [11][12]. In \n[13], a vision-based control system for a tracked excavator \nwas presented. The system includes several controllers \nthat collaborate to move the excavator from a starting \nposition to a goal position. Furthermore, a number of \nresearchers have investigated the feasibility of remote-\ncontrol excavation. Many of these studies have addressed \nthe possible use of the remote control approach on the \nexcavator [1][8]. However, in a remote-control excavator \nsystem, if the operator cannot sense the condition of \ncontact, the work efficiency will decrease in comparison \nto direct control by the human operator. So, design of the \njoystick with proper force feedback [14][15] is key to \ncontrolling an excavator remotely.  The joystick can make \nskilful operators adapt their operation to the excavating \nenvironment based on their empirical knowledge, and can \nfurther realize efficient excavation. Moreover, in contrast \nto controlling a real hydraulic excavator, there are many \nstudies which implement their work on the virtual \nexcavator [16][17].  The virtual excavator system appears \nto be a low-cost, safe, and reliable system that can be used \nto test both the system and the control strategy in a virtual \nenvironment. \nAs discussed above, many research studies have \nfocused on the modelling and controller development \nstages, but there is less literature studying the remote \noperation from a network communication point of view. \nFurthermore, it is found that efficiency of excavation by a \nhuman operator  [18] is a notable issue that has potential \ncommercial value. On the other hand, a remote-control \nexcavator has been the wish of both industry and \nmanufacturing over the past two decades. Much of the \nwork on terrestrial excavation has focused on tele-\noperation, rather than on the system requirements for \nautonomous operation. However, although remarkable \nand valuable progress has been made on automated \nexcavation, remote control of a full-scale excavator has \nnot been commercially demonstrated. \nIn this paper, we will report the further development \nbased on the work in [1] and will focus on the work from \nthe following two aspects: 1) trajectory tracking control of \nthe excavator base and 2) robust control of the excavator \narm. Section II studies the models of the excavator base \nand the excavator arm. Those models will provide the \nbasis for the system design, development of the \ncontrollers, task\/path planning, simulation, and validation, \netc. Section III investigates the control approaches for \ncontrolling the excavator base and the excavator arm. \nSection IV proposes a wireless networked control scheme \nfor the excavator base. Finally, the conclusions and future \nwork are given in section V. \nII. MODELLING OF AN EXCAVATOR \nA. Modelling of the excavator base \nThe excavator base model is taken from [19] and [20]. \nIt has two driving wheels and a free rotating front wheel. \nTwo wheels are independently driven by actuators to \nproduce transition and orientation.

Robust control of the excavator arm \nUsually, the excavator is required to carry out tasks \ninvolving contact with its environment, such as levelling \nand digging. In moving towards autonomous excavation, \nit is necessary to develop a controller that is robust to \nuncertainties associated with such tasks. \nAlthough there are some pronounced differences \nbetween the classical robot manipulator and robotic \nexcavation, there are also some parallels. Therefore, there \nare many control approaches which have been developed \nfor the robot manipulator that can be adopted by the \nrobotic excavation. In this section, we will firstly study \ncontrol of the excavator using the conventional computed \ntorque control which has been developed on the fully-\nactuated robot manipulator. Then, we will develop a \nrobust control approach which is effective to reject \nexternal disturbance during excavation. After that, \nextensive simulation results will be compared. \nUsing the dynamic model of the excavator arm in (5), \nthe computed torque control (CTC) law is given as below: \n )(\u02c6)(\u02c6),(\u02c6)(\u02c6 \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 &&&& aaavaa BGCDU +++=  (23) \nwhere apavdv ekek \u2212\u2212= &&&& \u03b8\u03b8 , dae \u03b8\u03b8 \u2212= , kv and kp are \nlinear gains to be designed, )(\u02c6 \u03b8aD is the estimated inertia; \n),(\u02c6 \u03b8\u03b8 &aC  is the estimated Coriolis and centripetal effects; \n)(\u02c6 \u03b8aG  is the estimated gravity forces; )(\u02c6 \u03b8&aB  is the \nestimated friction effects, Ua is the computed torques \napplied to the system, ddd \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 &&& ,,  are the desired joint link \nangle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, \nrespectively. \nIt is found that the CTC approach is specified by the \ninverse dynamics of the excavator (5). The controller (23) \ngenerates the generalized torques to be applied to the \nexcavator producing the desired motion. The simulation is \ncarried out in two cases: 1) tracking the desired motion \nwithout payload and 2) tracking the desired motion with \npayload (Mload=500kg) but it is assumed to be unknown. \nThe parameters of the excavator arm are given in \nAppendix. For both cases, the linear gains kv=100 and \nkp=150 are used.  \n5.8 6 6.2 6.4 6.6 6.8 7 7.2\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\nX0 (m)\nZ0\n (m\n)\n \n \nDesired Trajectory\nActual Trajectory\n \nFigure 4 The bucket (O3) trajectory under the CTC law without payload \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nO\n3 \ntra\nck\nin\ng \ner\nro\nr (\nm\n)\nTime (sec.)  \nFigure 5 The bucket (O3) tracking errors (solid line: without payload; \ndash line: with unknown payload) \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n0.07\n0.08\n0.09\nO\n4 \ntra\nck\nin\ng \ner\nro\nr (\nm\n)\nTime (sec.)  \nFigure 6 The bucket head (O4) tracking errors (solid line: without \npayload; dash line: with unknown payload) \nThe simulation results are presented as follows.

To analyze the performance of \nthe CTC law, Figure 5 and Figure 6 present the tracking \nerrors of the bucket and the bucket head, respectively. The \ntracking error is the absolute distance from the actual \ntrajectory to the desired trajectory. From Figure 5, it can \nbe seen that the case with unknown payload gives a \nmaximal tracking error which is about 0.056m, and the \naverage tracking error with payload is apparently larger \nthan the case without payload. Also, in Figure 6, the \ntracking performance is not as good as desired when the \nsystem is loaded with unknown payload.

The \ntracking results of the desired bucket motion by using both \ncontrol laws are presented in Figure 8. For both \nsimulations, the mass of the payload is assumed unknown \nfor the controller design. As shown in Figure 8, it can be \nseen that the CTC law gives a maximal tracking error \nwhich is about 0.056m, while the RC law gives a better \ntracking performance, i.e. the average tracking errors \ngiven by the RC law is obviously less than the average \ntracking errors given by the CTC law. In Figure 9, it can \nbe found that the tracking results are consistent with the \nresults shown in Figure 8. Although the RC law gives a \nlarge tracking error at the beginning, but the error \nbecomes smaller finally. Therefore, the comparison can \nvalidate that the RC law is more effective and more robust \nto uncertain circumstance. Furthermore, the control \ntorques by using the CTC law and the RC law are \ncompared in Figure 10. From the figure, it can be found \nthat the control inputs of the RC law are much larger than \nthe control inputs of the CTC law. It gives a reasonable \nresult that the RC law effectively reduces the tracking \nerror during the excavation, and gives a better tracking \nperformance. \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-1\n0\n1\nx 10\n7\n\u03c42\n (N\nm\n)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-5\n0\n5\nx 10\n6\n\u03c43\n (N\nm\n)\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n-5\n0\n5\nx 10\n5\n\u03c44\n (N\nm\n)\nTime (sec.)  \nFigure 10 The control torques with unknown payload (solid line: the \nCTC law; dash line: the RC law) \nIV.
