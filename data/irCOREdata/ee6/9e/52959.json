Introduction \nMaterial conservation is becoming a matter of increasing importance in the present and foreseeable \nworld economy. Wear is a major cause of concrete wastage in many application areas where over \ntime and as a direct consequence of the operating environment, the concrete becomes corroded and\/or \ncontaminated. This ultimately necessitates the arduous and costly undertaking of repairing or \nreplacing the affected concrete either by physical or mechanical means. Clearly, any means by which \nthe life of the concrete could be extended would be of great interest to all engineers, since any \nreduction in concrete wear could yield significant economic savings. \nThe relatively recent emergence of the technology of laser materials processing offers a viable \nalternative to the existing methods for improving the wear characteristics of concrete. Owing to their \nunique characteristics, lasers have the propensity to be employed for the non-contact processing of \nmaterials, such as concrete, which are otherwise difficult to process. To date, inroads have been made \nin establishing the laser processing of concrete. Most of the research, however, has concentrated on \nthe laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers, most prominently \nwith regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning [1-3]. Also, as part of nuclear plant \ndecommissioning, Li et al. [4-7] conducted research to determine the workability of several laser \ntechniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces. Such techniques \nexperimented with were: direct glazing of the concrete, single and multiple layer fusion cladding and \ncombined chemical\/fusion cladding. Work by Sugimoto et al. [8] focused upon modifying the surface \nappearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. The laser \ntreatment produced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and appearance unique to laser \ntreatment. The resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of the post-process cement \nbased materials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [9]. Borodina et al. [10] has carried \nout investigations into the structural changes within the composition of zirconia concrete caused by \nsurface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural changes, phase changes and the \nabsorptivity characteristics. In all of these studies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity \nformation were found to be major problems undermining the performance of the laser treated surface \nlayer. \n 4 \nIn contrast, more detailed and comprehensive studies conducted by Lawrence and Li have \ninvestigated the feasibility and characteristics of high power diode laser (HPDL) generated glazes on \nthe ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete [11, 12]. In further work, Lawrence and Li \nstudied the generation and carried out a comparison of the glazes generated with both CO2 and \nHPDL\u2019s [13, 14].  \nThis present work is concerned with determining the wear characteristics of a glaze generated on the \nOPC surface layer of concrete by means of CO2 and HPDL irradiation, and investing the differences \nthereof. This is of particular interest since both lasers have very different operating characteristics \nand my therefore yield very different results. In any case, it is hoped that this work will demonstrate \nthe practicability and efficacy of employing lasers for the processing of not only concrete, but many \nother building materials. \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1 Materials \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous OPC based concrete, with the usual \u2018as \ncast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete being the subject of the HPDL irradiation. The OPC surface of the \nconcrete had a thickness of 2.5 mm. For the purpose of experimental convenience the as-received \nconcrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 mm\n3\n) prior to laser treatment. The \ncomposition of the concrete bulk by volume is as follows: 20mm limestone aggregate (40%), 10mm \nlimestone aggregate (14%), zone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) and particulate fine aggregate (7%). \n2.2 Laser processing procedure  \nThis work was conducted using a CO2 laser (Trumpf, GmbH.) and a GaAlAs HPDL (Rofin-Sinar, \nGmbH., DL 020 S). The CO2 laser emitted at a wavelength of 10.6 \u00b5m and produced a multimode \nbeam with a maximum output power of 3 kW. The CO2 laser was integrated into a 5 axis \ncomputerised numerical control (CNC) workstation and so a series of optical units were used to \ndeliver the beam through a 2-axis (linear) and 2-axis (rotary) laser head to the concrete workpieces. \nThe beam was focused onto a plane above the surface of the OPC surface of the concrete using a 200 \nmm focal length KC1 lens to give a stable diverging beam. The HPDL used in this work emitted a \n 5 \nhigh order mode beam at 808 \u00b110 nm with a maximum output power of 2 kW. The HPDL beam was \ndelivered to the concrete workpieces by means of an optical fibre 10 m long and of 1500 \u00b5m core \ndiameter. The end of the fibre was connected to a focusing lens assembly with a focal length of 42 \nmm and was mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry table. The OPC surface of the concrete \nsamples was irradiated with the HPDL beam by traversing the samples beneath the beam using the x- \nand y-axis of the CNC gantry table. Both lasers were operated in the continuous wave (CW) mode \nand in both processes, the fumes produced were removed with an extraction system, whilst an O2 \nprocess gas being coaxially blown at a rate of 3 l\/min was used to shield the laser optics and assist in \nthe laser processing of the OPC surface of the concrete. The OPC surface of the concrete samples \nwere irradiated with both lasers using laser power densities of 2.25 kW\/cm\n2\n with traverse speeds of \n240 mm\/min and laser spot diameters of 10 mm. Only single tracks were generated with no \noverlapping. \n2.3 Wear testing procedure  \nTo determine the wear resistance characteristics of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes on the OPC \nsurface of concrete, as well as those of an untreated OPC surface, wear tests were conducted in \naccordance with Fig. 1. For experimental purposes the concrete samples were cut into smaller pieces \n(25 mm x 25 mm). Half of the samples were then laser treated. All the samples were then weighed. \nThe samples were then clamped individually in the vice of a common shaping machine. To provide \nabrasion and consequently cause wear on the surface of the samples, a spherical steel slider was \nattached to the floating head of the shaping machine and moved cyclically back and forth across the \nuntreated and laser treated glazes on the OPC surfaces. The spherical steel slider was fabricated from \na 25.4 mm diameter ball bearing with a hardness value of 700 VHN. As one can see from Fig. 1, the \nspherical steel slider was blunt and made a single point contact with the surfaces of the samples. The \ntotal distance moved in one cycle was 6 mm while the traverse speed was 180 mm\/min. By applying \nweights to the floating head a frictional force of 60 N was generated. The samples were subjected to \nthe frictional force for 8 h, being removed from the machine and weighed at 2 hourly intervals. The \nwear testing of the laser treated samples was carried out on single laser tracks of 10 mm width with \nno overlapping. Following completion of the wear tests it was observed that both of the laser \ngenerated glazes were present. \n 6 \n3. Results \n3.1 Wear characteristics in normal environmental conditions \nIn most cases the wear resistance of a material is related to the hardness of the material in comparison \nwith the that of other materials with which it subsequently comes into contact with [15]. However, \nwear resistance is not directly proportional to hardness, nor does it always increase with hardness \n[16]. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the laser generated \nglazes on the OPC and the untreated OPC. As one can see, the wear resistance of the HPDL \ngenerated OPC glaze is fractionally greater than that of the CO2 laser generated OPC glaze. However, \nboth the OPC laser glazes displayed a significant increase in wear resistance over the untreated OPC \nsurface, with the weight loss being approximately 2 times lower after 4 h, and 3 times lower after 8 h. \n3.2 Wear characteristics in corrosive environments \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, either as part of the normal service \nenvironment and\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore, corrosion resistance tests based upon \nBS 6431 [17] were conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and a detergent cleaner. The \nexperiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive agents on to the surface of \nthe CO2 and HPDL glazed OPC surfaces, as well as the untreated OPC surface of the concrete, at \nhourly intervals for four hours. The reagents were applied in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, \n40%, 20% and 10%. The samples were then examined optically, as well as being mechanically tested \nin terms of compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of the various corrosive agents were \nused principally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% nitric acid is used within the \nnuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels [18].  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nuntreated OPC surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater severity than \nthe detergent. On the other hand, both the CO2 and HPDL glazed surfaces displayed no discernible \nmicrostructural changes or signs of devitrification due to corrosion.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [19] revealed that exposure of the untreated OPC \nsurface to the reagents had a significant effect on the compressive strength and the wear resistance of \nthe OPC. As Fig. 3 shows, exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the \nconcentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately 19-37%. \n 7 \nIn the case of the detergent a discernible loss in compressive strength only occurred with \nconcentrations above 40%. Here the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the \nrange 60-80% was approximately 17%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the \nwear resistance or the compressive strength of the laser glazed OPC surfaces. Similarly, as Fig. 4 \nshows, the wear resistance of the untreated OPC surface when exposed to the reagents with an 80% \nconcentration was significantly affected, particularly through interaction with the nitric acid and the \nsodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss was approximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed \nOPC after 4 h, and approximately 11 times higher after 8 h for the nitric acid. In the case of the \ndetergent the weight loss was marginal after both 4 and 8 h. \n4. Discussion  \nIt is evident from the results of the wear tests that the CO2 and HPDL generated OPC glazes out \nperformed the untreated OPC surface. This was especially true in the case of wear tests conducted in \ncorrosive environments, where both of the OPC laser glazes proved to be resistant to the corrosive \nelements for the duration of the experiments. This marked variation in corrosion resistance can be \nascribed to the difference in structure of the laser generated OPC glazes and the untreated OPC.  \nAlthough the chemistry of the OPC surface of concrete and the hydration of its various constituents is \nhas not yet been fully resolved due to its complex nature, it is known that the constituents of OPC are \nminerals which exist as multi-component solid solution chemical compounds. One of the major \nconstituents of OPC is Ca, however, of particular importance with regards this study, OPC contains \nin relatively large proportions: SiO2 (21wt%); Al2O3 (5wt%) and Fe2O3 (3wt%), which are basic glass \nnetwork formers and modifiers. Consequently the intense local heating brought about by the incident \nCO2 and HPDL beams results in the melting of these compounds at around 1283\n0C, thereby causing \nthe materials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous glassy material consisting of various \ncalcium-silicate-alumina compounds [20]. Indeed, whereas the HPDL generated OPC glaze is of a \nfully amorphous nature and the CO2 laser OPC glaze is of a semi-amorphous nature, the untreated \nOPC is comprised of a porous polycrystalline structure (see Fig 5); thus the untreated OPC is readily \nattacked by acids, whilst the amorphous structures of both OPC laser glazes ensures an increase in \ncorrosion resistance [12]. Indeed, this postulation is borne out somewhat when one considers the laser \ngenerated microstructures. In Fig. 6(a) the microstructure of the HPDL generated glaze can be seen to \n 8 \nhave no discernible structure and appears to be fully amorphous. But, even though sizeable areas of \nthe CO2 laser generated OPC glaze exhibit a randomly located regular columnar structure, the \nmajority of the CO2 laser generated OPC glaze appears to be of an amorphous structure and thus \naffords the glaze adequate protection against corrosive reagents.  \nIt is within this glazed region that the reasons for the differences in the performance of OPC glaze \ngenerated with the CO2 and the HPDL exists. As is evident from Fig. 7, cracking and the formation of \npores in the CO2 and HPDL induced glazes occurred to various degrees depending upon the laser \nused. The formation of cracks can be attributed mainly to thermal stresses generated during laser \nirradiation. This is due to the fact that OPC has low thermal conductivity, and, as such, during laser \nheating a large thermal gradient between the melt zone and the substrate exists which results in the \ngeneration of thermal stresses. Additionally, despite the fact that the laser surface treatment process is \neffectively localised in nature, the fact remains that a certain amount of the heat generated will be \nconducted to sections of the OPC where the surface is already glazed. This, combined with existence \nof a relatively cold OPC substrate means that thermal stresses will be generated. During the heating \nphase the stresses will be compressive and relieved by plastic deformation, thus precluding crack \nformation. At high temperatures (T\u2265Tm) the stresses can also be relieved [21-23]. However, during \ncooling when the temperature falls below Tm, then stresses will accumulate. If the fracture strength of \nthe material is exceeded, then cracking within the melted layer will occur. The thermal stress \u03c3, \ninduced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation:  \n        \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (1) \nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u2206T is the temperature change, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal expansion \nand \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. If it is assumed that the glass formed on the surface of the OPC is similar to \nsoda-lime-silica glass because the compositions of the two materials are similar, then the following \nvalues for a typical soda-lime-silica glass can be used: E=6.42 x 104 MN m-2, \u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1 and \n\u03bd=0.176. So, when the OPC surface of the concrete was irradiated by the CO2 laser beam \u2206T=1390\n0C \nand for the HPDL \u2206T=12630C, then by substituting the values into Equation (1) the CO2 and HPDL \nbeams produced a thermal stress in the resulting glass of around 305 and 254 MN\/m2 respectively. \nSince this is well in excess of the fracture strength of the glass (glaze), 120 MN\/m2 [24], cracking will \noccur, and can only be avoided by severe distortion or through the reduction of \u2206T by pre-heating.  \n 9 \nFrom Fig. 7 it can be seen that the pores formed in the CO2 and HPDL induced glazes varied in size \nfrom microscopic pits to large craters depending upon both the laser operating parameters and the \nactual laser employed. For all instances of pore formation the mechanism behind their development is \nthe consequence of gas escaping from within the melt and disrupting the surface [25]. With regard to \nthe OPC glaze, the gas is likely to be CO2 [9]. If the laser energy density incident on the OPC is too \nlow, then the generated CO2 can not escape from the molten OPC surface easily because of the high \nviscosity of the melt. As such, when the CO2 gas eventually does penetrate the melt surface, the \nresultant pore is not filled by the flow of the melt; since the insufficient energy density is unable to \nmaintain a high enough temperature for an adequate length of time and thus decrease the overall \nviscosity of the melt [26]. In this case the pores formed are typically small and shallow, being regular \nin both periodicity and intensity . On the other hand, if the laser energy density incident on the OPC \nsurface of the concrete is too high, then boiling of the surface may happen. At the same time an \nincrease in CO2 gas formation may occur within the melt. These individual pockets of CO2 gas \nformation may combine and rise to surface of the melt. Once the energy density decreases (as the \nlaser traverses away), then the additional CO2 gas will attempt to escape from the molten surface. \nHowever, the solidifying melt will prevent this, causing bubbles to form. The excessive CO2 gas \npressure will firstly cause the bubbles to expand and ultimately rupture the walls of the bubbles \ncreating a sharp \u2018knife edge\u2019 pore [4, 9]. These types of pore are usually large, deep and randomly \nspaced. \nThe pores and cracks generated following laser treatment, especially CO2 laser treatment, will play a \nvital role in determining the wear characteristics of the glazes due to their influence on the surface \nroughness. The average surface roughness (Ra) of the untreated OPC surface was 21.91 \u00b5m, whilst \nfor the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes the surface roughness was measured as 5.04 \u00b5m and 2.88 \u00b5m \nrespectively. Such differences in the surface roughness values of the laser generated glazes can be \nattributed to the differences in wavelength, and in turn absorption characteristics differences which \ncause different cooling and solidification rates. It is worth remarking that, perhaps unsurprisingly, the \nsurface roughness measurements show some correlation with the wear test results given in Fig. 2. \nThe generally superior mechanical and chemical performance of the laser generated OPC glazes over \nthe untreated OPC suggests that the life characteristics of the OPC glazes may also be superior to \nthose of untreated OPC. Yet in any analysis of the wear life of the two materials, the in-situ relative \nthickness of the HPDL generated glaze and the untreated OPC layer on concrete must be considered \n 10 \nin order to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics. This is particularly true when \nconsidering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). \nConsequently the increase in wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nLaser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (2) \nwhere, \n)\/h(mg\/cm rateWear \n\/cm)(mg\/cm Thickness .Density \n = lifeWear \n12\n3\n (2a) \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the HPDL generated glaze \nover the untreated OPC surface. As is clearly evident from Table 1, the HPDL generated glaze \neffected an increase in actual life over the untreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. \nFurther, it can be seen that the increase in actual life of the HPDL generated glaze over the untreated \nOPC surface varies considerably depending upon the working environment. Notwithstanding this, \narguably the most common working environment for an OPC surface would involve some contact \nwith at least detergent acids, therefore yielding significant economic savings since a HPDL glazed \nOPC surface lasts around 2.5-times longer than one which is unglazed.  \n5. Conclusions  \nThe wear characteristics of a glaze generated on the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of \nconcrete was using a 2 kW high power diode laser (HPDL) and a 3 kW CO2 laser have been \ndetermined. Within both normal and corrosive (detergent, NaOH and HNO3) environmental \nconditions, the wear rate of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes were 3.9 mg\/cm\n2\/h and 3.5 mg\/cm2\/h \nrespectively. In contrast, the untreated OPC surface of concrete exhibited a wear rate of 9.8 mg\/cm2\/h \nin normal environmental conditions and 18.5, 73.8 and 114.8 mg\/cm2\/h when exposed to detergent, \nNaOH and HNO3 respectively. Life assessment testing revealed that surface glazing of the OPC with \nboth the CO2 and the HPDL effected an increase in wear life of 1.3 to 17.7 times over an untreated \nOPC surface, depending upon the corrosive environment. The reasons for these marked \nimprovements in the wear resistance and wear life of the CO2 and HPDL generated glazes over the \nuntreated OPC surface of concrete can be attributed to: (i) the partial (CO2 laser) and full (HPDL) \nvitrification of the OPC surface after laser treatment which subsequently created a much more dense \nand consolidated surface that is effectively a glass and (ii) the generation of a surface with improved \n 11 \nmicrostructure and phase which is more resistant in corrosive environments. The wear life and the \nwear rate of the HPDL glaze was consistently higher than that of the CO2 laser glaze. This is due to \nthe fact that the wavelengths at which both lasers emit at are very different and consequently, \ndifferences will exist between the CO2 and HPDL beam absorption characteristics of the OPC. Such \ndifferences are the cause of the distinct glaze characteristics, with the glaze generated after HPDL \ninteraction being fully amorphous in nature, whilst the glaze generated after CO2 laser interaction was \nseen to be of a semi-amorphous structure, with sizeable areas of a regular columnar structure \nrandomly located within the glaze. In turn, each microstructure will possess its own unique wear \nresistance characteristics. \n \n 12 \nReferences \n1. K. Sugita, M. Mori, T.
