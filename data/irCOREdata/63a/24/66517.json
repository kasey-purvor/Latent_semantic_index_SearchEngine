For Schwarzschild black holes this is at\nRms = 6Rg (where Rg = GM\/c\n2), while for maximally ro-\ntating Kerr black holes (spin parameter a = 0.998) this re-\nduces to 1.23Rg . Bright accretion flows give a way to obser-\nvationally test such ideas as well as to directly estimate the\nspin of the black hole. Optically thick material in Keplerian\norbits should emit a quasi-thermal spectrum with maximum\ntemperature emission from the largest luminosity\/smallest\narea regions i.e. set by the last stable orbit (Shakura & Sun-\nyaev 1973). As these models are thermal, there is a clear\nprediction that their maximum temperature, Tmax, should\nincrease with total disc luminosity as Ldisc \u221d T\n4\nmax, if the\nemission is from a constant area i.e. if there is a constant in-\nner disc radius. Strong observational support for this comes\nfrom the Galactic black hole (GBH) binary systems. These\ncan show disc dominated spectra (often termed the high\/soft\nstate) where Ldisc \u221d T\n4\nmax over large changes in luminosity\n(Ebisawa et al. 1993; Kubota, Makishima & Ebisawa 2001;\nKubota & Makishima 2004). The fixed radius inferred from\nthe proportionality constant of this relation is consistent\nwith a Keplerian disc (stress-free inner boundary condition)\nin a low\u2013to\u2013moderate spin spacetime (a<\n\u223c\n0.8) for all GBH\nfor which this experiment can be performed (Gierlin\u00b4ski &\nDone 2004; Li et al. 2005; Shafee et al. 2005; Davis, Done\n& Blaes 2005). This ties in with the spins expected from\nmodels of stellar collapse. These predict a maximum birth\nspin of a \u223c 0.8 from the combination of slow rotation of the\npre-supernovae core and angular momentum losses through\ngravitational wave radiation during collapse (e.g. Gammie,\nShapiro & McKinney 2004), and there is not enough mass\ntransfer in the binary evolution to cause appreciable spin up\nfrom accretion (King & Kolb 1996).\nHowever, there is growing evidence that the accretion\ndisc inner radius can also be larger than Rms, due to the\ninner disc evaporating into hot, geometrically thick accre-\ntion flow. These models were developed in response to ob-\nservations of GBH at low luminosity (generally termed the\nlow\/hard state), where the expected accretion disc emission\nis much weaker and at lower temperature than predicted\nby an optically thick disc extending down to the last stable\norbit (e.g Esin et al. 2001; Frontera et al. 2001). Instead,\nthe X-ray spectra peak at \u223c100 keV (see e.g. the review\nby Zdziarski & Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004), requiring that the contin-\nuum is formed in hot, optically thin plasma, which is not\nstrongly cooled by Compton scattering of seed photons (e.g.\nZdziarski & Gierlin\u00b4ski 2004). These cooling limits are very\ndifficult (Barrio, Done & Nayakshin 2003; though not im-\npossible e.g. Beloborodov 1999) to reconcile with a cool disc\nextending down to the minimum stable orbit. Other obser-\nvational advantages of truncated disc configuration is that\nit can provide a geometric explanation for the major X-ray\nspectral state transitions seen in GBH by a physical change\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS\n2 C. Done, M. Gierlin\u00b4ski\nin the accretion flow structure. At low luminosities the in-\nner cool disc is replaced by a hot accretion flow. The tran-\nsition radius between the two phases is far from the hole,\nfew photons from the disc illuminate the hot flow and the\nspectrum is hard. As the transition radius moves inwards\nthe disc penetrates further into the hot flow, so more seed\nphotons cool the flow and its spectrum softens until the disc\nextends down to the last stable orbit (Esin et al. 1997). This\nchanging transition radius also gives a changing size scale to\nassociate with the changing characteristic frequencies seen\nin the variability power spectra (see e.g. the review by Done\n2001).\nTheoretically, such hot inner flows are generically pro-\nduced by a range of analytic approximations to the accretion\nflow equations. In these, the protons are heated by grav-\nity, while the electrons gain energy only through Coulomb\ncollisions and cool predominantly via Compton scattering\n(Shapiro, Lightman & Eardley 1975), advection (Narayan\n& Yi 1995), outflows (Blandford & Begelman 1999), con-\nvection (Abramowicz & Igumenshchev 2001) or jets (Fal-\ncke, Ko\u00a8rding & Markoff 2004). Numerical simulations of\nthe accretion flow at low densities, including the self con-\nsistently generated magnetic dynamo viscosity (Balbus &\nHawley 1991), appear to show some form of inner hot flow,\nthough its properties are more complex than any of the ap-\nproximate analytic solutions above (Hawley & Balbus 2002).\nAnother argument for the truncated disc comes from\nthe quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the power\ndensity spectra of black hole binaries. During the transition\nfrom the low\/hard to the high\/soft spectral state their fre-\nquency typically increases (e.g. Cui et al. 1999; Rossi et al.\n2004) indicating a decreasing size-scale in the accretion flow.\nIf the QPO frequency is directly related to the transition\nradius between the cold disc and the hot inner flow (Stella\n& Vietri 1998; Titarchuk, Osherovich & Kuznetsov 1999;\nPsaltis & Norman 2000) then its behaviour is consistent with\na decreasing truncation radius as the source approaches the\nsoft state.\nClearly, the point at which the cool disc truncates is of\ngreat importance to our understanding of the nature of the\naccretion flow, and hence whether we can use observations\nof compact objects to test strong gravity. Fortunately there\nis an independent constraint on this from the shape of the\nfluorescent iron line produced by X-ray illumination of the\ncool disc. Special and general relativistic effects are both\nimportant as the disc material is in very high velocity (Kep-\nlerian) orbits in a strong gravitational field. All these effects\nget stronger as the disc extends closer to the black hole,\nso the width of the line gives a measure of the inner edge\nof the cool fluorescing material (Fabian et al. 1989; 2000).\nThus for the accretion flow model above in which there is a\nvariable truncation radius between a disc and inner hot flow,\nthe line width should be correlated with spectral hardness.\nHard spectra (generally seen at low L\/LEdd) should have\nnarrow lines, softer spectra should have broader lines. There\nare indications that this correlation is seen both in AGN\n(Lubin\u00b4ski & Zdziarski 2001) and in GBH (Z\u02d9ycki, Done &\nSmith 1998; Churazov, Gilfanov & Revnivtsev 2000; Ibrag-\nimov et al. 2005).\nHowever, some of the more recent results from the line\nshape seen in the GBH do not fit easily into this picture.\nThere are reported lines in the low\/hard state (i.e hard X-ray\nspectra, with QPO frequencies which are not at their maxi-\nmum values) which are so broad as to require a disc around\na maximally spinning black hole, illuminated by highly cen-\ntrally concentrated radiation field, perhaps implying direct\ntapping of the spin energy of the black hole or at least sub-\nstantial continuous stress across the last stable orbit (Mini-\nutti, Fabian & Miller 2004; Miller et al. 2002; Miller et al.\n2004a). Plainly this would rule out the inner hot flow model\nif there is no alternative explanation for the line width. The\nclearest example of this discrepancy is the BeppoSAX data\nof the bright low\/hard state of XTE J1650\u2013500. The line\nwidth in this spectrum is also in conflict with the moder-\nate spin derived from the luminosity-temperature relation\nobtained when this object shows disc dominated spectra\n(Gierlin\u00b4ski & Done 2004). Thus the extent of the disc in-\nferred from the iron line width in XTE J1650\u2013500 seems at\nodds with the broad band spectral shape, the QPOs, and\nthe disc continuum emission.\nHere we re-examine the BeppoSAX data on XTE\nJ1650\u2013500 and show that while these data are indeed consis-\ntent with an extreme relativistic line, they can be fit equally\nwell (or better) using a model of a \u2018normal\u2019 relativistic line\n(i.e. from a truncated disc with standard gravitational en-\nergy release), together with blueshifted highly ionized nar-\nrow absorption features (predominantly resonance lines of\nHe- and H-like iron). These absorption features distort the\nblue edge of the line, especially where the reflection spec-\ntrum is ionized and\/or from high inclination material. If the\npresence of such material is confirmed then this removes the\nonly observational evidence against a truncated disc inter-\npretation of the low\/hard state in GBH.\n2 THE DATA\nWe extract the XTE J1650\u2013500 BeppoSAX archival data\ntaken on 2001 September 11 for both the Medium-Energy\nConcentrator Spectrometer (MECS) and Phoswich Detector\nSystem (PDS) instruments, using the standard (September\n1997) background, auxiliary response (MECS) and redis-\ntribution files (MECS and PDS). We use the same energy\nranges as Miniutti et al. (2004), i.e. 2.5\u201310 keV (MECS) and\n13\u2013200 keV (PDS), with 2 per cent systematic errors added\nin quadrature to the PDS data. We checked the publicly\navailable Crab PDS data and obtain reduced \u03c72\/\u03bd = 0.9\nfor a single power law of energy index 1.13, showing that\nthis prescription is an adequate description of the response\nuncertainties.\nWe also extract the RXTE Proportional Counter Ar-\nray (PCA) and High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment\n(HEXTE) spectra from the entire outburst. We calculate\nthe X-ray colours and estimate the bolometric luminosity\nfollowing the method of Done & Gierlin\u00b4ski (2003). We used\nthe distance of 4 kpc (Tomsick et al. 2003) and mass of 7.3\nM\u2299 (Orosz et al. 2004) for the luminosity estimate. We also\nextracted the power-density spectra from PCA observations\nin the 1\/128 to 64 Hz frequency band and fitted them by a\nmultiple Lorentzian model.\nWe use xspec version 11.3.1 (Arnaud 1996) for spectral\nfitting. The error of each model parameter is given for a 90\nper cent confidence interval. We fix the absorption column\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\nTruncated disc versus extremely broad iron line 3\nFigure 1. The top panel shows the evolution of the total, absorption corrected, bolometric luminosity (as a function of Eddington) for\nall the RXTE pointed observations of the outburst of XTE J1650\u2013500. The total flux is derived from fitting the PCA and HEXTE data\nwith a model of an accretion disc plus its Comptonized emission (together with a broad line and smeared edge to mimic reflection). The\nmiddle panel shows the low frequency QPO derived from fitting the broad-band power spectra with multiple Lorentzian components,\nwhile the bottom panel shows the soft (triangles, red in colour) and hard (black squares) X-ray colours. Both QPO and colours are still\nevolving smoothly at the point where the BeppoSAX data were taken (vertical line). In the context of a truncated disc model for the\nlow\/hard state, this implies that the disc has not yet reached the last stable orbit.\nat NH = 5\u00d710\n21 cm\u22122 in all fits (Miller et al. 2002; Miniutti\net al. 2004).\n3 TIMING AND SPECTRAL EVOLUTION\nDURING THE OUTBURST\nFig. 1 shows the estimated bolometric luminosity, the fre-\nquency of the strong low-frequency QPO and X-ray colours\nobtained from the RXTE. The vertical line marks the time\nof the BeppoSAX observation analysed in this paper. The\nQPO frequency during the BeppoSAX observation is plainly\nnot the maximum seen from this source. Any association of\nthe QPO with the inner radius of the cool disc clearly re-\nquires that the disc does not extend down to the last stable\norbit, but truncates above this point. The X-ray colours show\nthat the BeppoSAX data were taken while the source is still\nsmoothly softening, in a position which is associated with\nthe softest low\/hard states. Given that the spectrum soft-\nens further after the BeppoSAX observation, models of the\nbroad band spectra with a moving inner disc predict that\nthe disc truncates above the last stable orbit. Thus both\nthe QPOs and broad band spectral shape indicate that the\ninnermost parts of a cool disc are not present. This is in\nconflict with the extreme iron line smearing in these same\ndata which requires that the disc extends down to the last\nstable orbit of a high spin black hole.\n4 MECS 2\u201310 KEV DATA: 45\u25e6 INCLINATION\n4.1 Simple models\nWith the MECS data we can reproduce the extreme rela-\ntivistic broadening of Miniutti et al. (2004). We use their\nphenomenological model of a smeared edge and iron line\nwith extreme Kerr spacetime distortions (the laor model\nin xspec) on a continuum consisting of a disc spectrum and\npower law. This gives an adequate fit (\u03c72 = 70.9\/65) to the\ndata, and the parameters of the strong iron line (equivalent\nwidth of 190+30\n\u221220 eV) do indeed point to a very small inner\ndisc radius of rin \u2261 Rin\/Rg = 2.20\n+0.06\n\u22120.16 with extreme central\nconcentration of the illumination, \u221d r\u2212q where q = 4.3+0.4\u22120.3.\nA similarly extreme line is seen using the same model in the\nXMM-Newton data taken a few days after the BeppoSAX\nobservation (Miller et al. 2002).\nThe xspec laor code is written for the specific case\nof calculating the relativistic effects on a line which can\nbe approximated as an initial delta function. This is iden-\ntical to the transfer function, so relativistic effects on an\narbitrary initial spectrum can be calculated by simply con-\nvolving the initial spectrum with this transfer function. We\nrecoded the laor model into a convolution model (here-\nafter called conline) in xspec and use this to smear a full\nreflected spectrum (the pexriv model in xspec with addi-\ntional narrow gaussian line) to replace the phenomenological\nsmeared edge\/line features in the previous fit. Convolution\nmeans that the spectrum outside of the observed energy\nband can be important so we always extend the energy range\nused by xspec to 0.2\u201350 keV.\nWe follow Miller et al. (2002) and Miniutti et al. (2004)\nand fix the inclination angle to 45\u25e6 and assume solar abun-\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n4 C. Done, M. Gierlin\u00b4ski\ndances. We constrain the radial emissivity index to be be-\ntween 3 and 5 as suggested by these previous fits. This gives\n\u03c72 = 75.7\/65, i.e. slightly worse than the phenomenological\napproximation for reflected continuum emission. The best-\nfitting model is reflection dominated, with \u2126\/2\u03c0 = \u221e, i.e.\nfor a model in which the intrinsic continuum is hidden from\nview. However, this is poorly constrained, with the error\nrange allowing \u2126\/2\u03c0 > 0.7. By contrast the line param-\neters are fairly well constrained, with equivalent width of\n120 \u00b1 25 eV, and inner disc radius of rin = 2.2\n+0.18\n\u22120.12 and\nq = 3.7+0.3\u22120.3. Thus the line parameters do change with the\naddition of a reflected continuum, most significantly in re-\nducing the equivalent width, although the smearing is also\naffected, with the illumination being not quite so centrally\nconcentrated. Detailed results on the line equivalent width\n(and to a lesser extent the shape) derived without includ-\ning a reflected continuum should be treated with caution.\nNonetheless, the small disc inner radius is very similar to\nthat in the phenomenological fits; there is a very broad fea-\nture in the data between 4\u20137 keV as shown in Fig. 2a.\n4.2 Complex reflection\nThe reflected component from the pexriv fits in the previ-\nous section is strongly ionized. This means that the intrinsic\niron line emission from the disc is not narrow. It should in-\nstead be strongly Comptonized, and this Comptonization\nshould also affect the edge in the reflected continuum (Ross,\nFabian & Young 1999). The neglect of Compton scattering\nbelow 12 keV in pexriv means that this code has an edge\nwhich which is artificially deep and sharp for a highly ion-\nized disc. We replace the pexriv reflected continuum and\nnarrow gaussian line with reflected spectra of D. Ballantyne\nfrom a constant density ionized disc (hereafter CDID; Bal-\nlantyne, Iwasawa & Fabian 2001, based on Ross & Fabian\n1993) which are publicly available as xspec table models.\nThese calculate the reflected spectrum from an X-ray illumi-\nnated slab of constant density, including Compton up- and\ndown-scattering below 12 keV, with self consistent iron (and\nother elements) line calculation for solar abundance mate-\nrial. These give \u03c72 = 93.7\/67 for a highly smeared, ionized\nslab, somewhat worse than the (unphysical) fits above, but\nwith two fewer free parameters as the line energy and width\nare now calculated self-consistently with the reflected con-\ntinuum. The reflection emission is highly ionized, lg(\u03be\/erg\ncm s\u22121) = 3.79+0.03\u22120.08, and again the spectrum is consistent\nwith pure reflected continuum, although the errors are wide\nand only restrict \u2126\/2\u03c0 > 0.6.\nThe best fit again picks out extreme relativistic smear-\ning, with q = 5+0\n\u22121.2 and rin = 3.0\n+0.3\n\u22120.4. However, the signif-\nicance of detection of relativistic smearing is reduced with\nrespect to the reflection models which do not include Comp-\ntonization of the line and edge features. The pexriv based\nreflection models give \u2206\u03c72 \u223c 190 for removing all smear-\ning from the model, while the CDID reflection models give\n\u2206\u03c72 \u223c 13.\nFigs. 2(b) and (c) show these fits with extreme relativis-\ntic smearing, and no relativistic smearing, respectively. It is\nclear that the intrinsic reflected emission alone \u2013 mainly the\nedge in the reflected continuum rather than the line itself,\nas there is very little line emission at these high ionizations\n\u2013 can match most of the broad feature in the data. This can\nhave a strong impact on the detection significance of rela-\ntivistic smearing and some impact on the detailed parame-\nters. Plainly it is important to use an accurate description of\nionized reflection. However, there is considerable uncertainty\nin these models as they depend on the (unknown) vertical\nand radial ionization structure of the disc. The CDID mod-\nels assume that the reflecting material can be approximated\nby a slab of constant (vertical and radial) density. Yet a\ndisc is in hydrostatic equilibrium so its structure responds\nto the incident radiation (Nayakshin, Kazanas & Kallman\n2000; Ballantyne, Ross & Fabian 2001). The upper layers\nare heated to the Compton temperature of the illuminating\nflux, so they expand, becoming less dense and more ionized.\nFor hard power law illumination the Compton temperature\nis large, so the upper layers are completely ionized, forming\na skin on top of the disc, but for softer illuminating spec-\ntra (such as that of the data used here) the upper layers of\nthe disc are still visible so the difference between the hy-\ndrostatic and constant ionization reflection models is much\nsmaller (Done & Nayakshin 2001). As well as this vertical\nstructure, there should also be a radial dependance of the\nionization structure of the disc, and the full reflected emis-\nsion should be the emissivity weighted integral of all of these\ndifferent radii regions with vertical ionization structure.\nWe use the xion code (Nayakshin et al. 2000) to model\nreflection from a disc of material in hydrostatic equilibrium\nfrom power law illumination, i.e. including both radial and\nvertical ionization gradients. This can be used to produce the\ntotal emission (direct plus reflected), in which the contribu-\ntion of reflection is hardwired into the spectrum for a given\ngeometry. However, in order to give a comparable number\nof degrees of freedom as in the CDID fits, we use xion to\ncalculate the reflected emission only, and add a power law as\nthe incident continuum so that the fraction \u2126\/2\u03c0 is allowed\nto vary. We use the magnetic flares geometry to calculate\nthe reflected emission from 10\u2013100 Schwarzschild radii from\na disc accreting at L\/LEdd = 0.05 (see Fig. 1). The xion\ncode includes relativistic smearing, but only for non-rotating\nblack holes, so we switch this off and use the conline convo-\nlution model as before. This gives a somewhat worse fit than\nbefore, with \u03c72\/\u03bd = 100\/67. A better fit can be obtained by\nsetting L\/LEdd = 1, with \u03c7\n2\/\u03bd = 86.1\/67. This is due to the\nhigher disc density expected at higher mass accretion rates.\nBoth models give rin \u223c 2.2\u00b10.2 and q \u223c 3.5\u00b10.3 and again\nthe best fit is reflection dominated.\n4.3 Inclination\nThe inclination of the system is is not well known, but re-\ncent studies of the companion star indicate that its mini-\nmum value is 50 \u00b1 3\u25e6 (Orosz et al. 2004), showing that the\nassumption of 45\u25e6 in the previous fits is probably too low.\nThe filled squares in Fig. 3a show the increase in \u03c72\nwith inclination for the fits for the CDID reflection models.\nPlainly the lower inclination fits are preferred by the data.\nHowever, we note that there is no minimum in \u03c72 at 45\u25e6\nas seen from pexriv based reflection models (Miller et al.\n2002), so removing the only reason for using this inclina-\ntion. These fits become very unstable so we fix q = 3 and\nassume that the continuum is purely reflected emission (i.e.\nno intrinsic continuum visible) in order to produce the plots.\nHowever, we checked that these assumptions do not qualita-\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\nTruncated disc versus extremely broad iron line 5\nFigure 2. MECS data fit to solar abundance reflection assuming an inclination of 45\u25e6. The (red in colour) dotted curve corresponds\nto the reflection, while the solid (cyan in colour) curve shows the sum of the reflection and the disc emission which is out of scale in\nthese figures. Panel (a) shows the best fit using pexriv based reflection model, in which the reflector is highly ionized, and is extremely\nrelativistically smeared. These relativistic effects strongly distort the intrinsic reflected spectrum. Panel (b) shows the very different\nreflected emission produced by CDID models, where the line and edge are intrinsically broad due to Comptonization. The best-fitting\nreflected spectrum is highly ionized, and extremely relativistically smeared. Panel (c) shows the same reflection model as in (b) but with\nno relativistic effects at all applied, so this fit is not dependent on inclination. The disc is again highly ionized, so the line is intrinsically\nbroad and this intrinsic shape is a fairly good match to the data. This fit is only \u2206\u03c72 = 13 worse than the best fit (with the loss of\n2 degrees of freedom). Panel (d) shows the fit including ionized absorption from outflowing material. The inferred relativistic smearing\nreduces dramatically, so this fit is relatively independent of inclination\ntively affect the results, unless we allow for extremely cen-\ntrally concentrated emission. We can obtain good fits with\n\u03c72 \u223c 92 at higher inclinations up to 70\u25e6, but only with\nq \u223c 15.\nAt higher inclinations, the highly smeared solution be-\ncomes a worse fit to the data because of the increasing\nblueshift of the relativistic transfer function due to the larger\nprojected line of sight velocities (e.g. Fabian et al. 1989).\nThe fit compensates for this by increasing the gravitational\nredshift i.e. by decreasing the disc inner radius and\/or by in-\ncreasing q. Since this figure is made for constant q = 3 then\nthis requires that the inner radius decreases. However, this\ndoes not give enough gravitational redshift to compensate\nfor the increased line broadening and most of the increase\nin \u03c72 comes from this increased blue extent of the spectral\nfeatures. These extremely smeared fits then have a worse \u03c72\nthan the very different fits in which the line is mostly un-\nsmeared, as described in the section above (see Fig. 2c). This\nsolution is mostly independent of inclination as the intrinsic\nshape of the reflected emission below 10 keV is independent\nof inclination (Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995), as are the rel-\nativistic effects for large inner disc radii. Because these two\nsolutions, the extremely smeared and almost unsmeared, are\nfar apart in parameter space, they give a double minimum in\n\u03c72 space. We show the \u03c72 for the mostly unsmeared fits as\nthe open triangles in Fig. 3(a), and it is plain that these are\na much better description of the data for inclinations above\n45\u25e6 than the highly smeared fits (filled squares). Fig. 3(b)\nshows the corresponding disc inner radius inferred for each\nsolution as a function of inclination. Plainly, as the best fit\nswitches between these two very different solutions, there is\na corresponding dramatic jump in inferred disc inner radius.\nThe residuals to the (mostly) unsmeared fit for an incli-\nnation of 45\u25e6 in Fig. 2(c) show a clear feature at \u223c 7.5 keV\n(the smeared fit in Fig. 2b also shows a similar feature).\nThis looks like a fairly narrow absorption feature, and in-\ncluding a narrow, gaussian line (with best-fitting energy\n7.58 keV and equivalent width of \u223c100 eV) improves the\nfit by \u2206\u03c72 = 17.4, making it significantly better. The rel-\nativistic smearing reduces dramatically, now being entirely\nconsistent with q = 3, and with a larger disc inner radius,\nrin = 9\n+11\n\u22124 .\n4.4 Narrow resonance line absorption\nMotivated by the fits above, we consider how such absorp-\ntion lines can occur. Observationally, strong resonance ab-\nsorption lines are often seen from high inclination Galactic\nbinary systems, generally from iron K\u03b1 He- and H-like iron\nat 6.7 and 7.0 keV (e.g. Ueda et al 1998; Kotani et al. 2000;\nLee et al. 2002; Ueda et al. 2004). However, if this absorbing\nmaterial is outflowing then substantial blueshifts could be\nobserved, and are seen in AGN (Pounds et al. 2003). If the\nfeature at \u223c 7.6 keV is an absorption line from iron then this\nimplies a velocity of \u223c0.09c or 0.13c depending on whether\nthe identification is with the H or He-like ion.\nWe use the xstar photoionization models which are\npublicly available as xspec multiplicative model tables. We\nchoose the ones calculated for power law illumination of a\nconstant density photoionized column with turbulent veloc-\nity of 100 km s\u22121. This gives an improved \u03c72 for all incli-\nnations with the CDID reflection models (see Fig. 3c), and\ndramatically changes the inferred smearing of the reflected\nemission (Fig. 3d). The relativistic line is now always con-\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n6 C. Done, M. Gierlin\u00b4ski\nFigure 3. Panel (a) shows the inclination dependance of \u03c72 for\nthe MECS data fit with a disc blackbody and relativistically\nsmeared CDID ionized reflection with q = 3. The best-fitting\nsolution switches between a highly smeared model (filled squares,\nblue in colour) and a mostly unsmeared solution (open triangles,\nred in colour). Panel (b) shows the derived disc inner radius for\neach solution. For the extreme smearing, the increase in inclina-\ntion causes a large blueshift of the relativistic transfer function\nwhich is compensated by the fit by increasing the gravitational\nredshift, i.e. decreasing the inner radius. However, this also leads\nto increased broadening of the spectral features, and the total\nspectral shape does not match the data as well as at lower incli-\nnations. Conversely, for the mostly unsmeared fit, there is very\nlittle change with inclination in either \u03c72 or derived radius. Pan-\nels (c) and (d) show how these results change with the inclusion\nof outflowing ionized absorption (predominantly blueshifted H-\nand He-like iron resonance lines). This gives better fits at all in-\nclinations, for a disc inner radius which is always consistent with\nbeing larger than 6Rg.\nsistent with the illumination of q = 3 expected from gravi-\ntational energy release, and the inner disc radius is greater\nthan 6Rg .\nThe existence of several narrow features in the ionized\nabsorber between 6.6\u20137 keV means that \u03c72 space is complex,\nwith multiple local minima. However, the column in all fits\nis \u223c 1022 cm\u22122 of ionized material (\u03be \u223c 100 erg cm s\u22121)\noutflowing at \u223c0.1\u20130.15c, with the best-fitting redshift of\n0.151+0.007\u22120.003 . This model for an inclination of 45\n\u25e6 is shown in\nFig. 2(d).\nThis effect is only seen when using the newer models\nof reflection from ionized material, which include the self-\nconsistent Comptonization of the iron line and edge by the\nhot upper layers of the disc. Fig. 4 (grey, or green in colour,\nline) shows the best-fitting model using the pexriv reflected\ncontinuum and narrow Gaussian line, convolved with the\nlaor relativistic profile. The sharp drop at \u223c7.2 keV seen\nin the data can be matched by the sharp blue wing of the\nrelativistically smeared, intrinsically narrow line. By con-\ntrast, the black line in Fig. 4 shows the best-fitting model\nFigure 4. The grey (green in colour) line shows the best-fitting\nextreme smearing model where the intrinsic reflected emission is\ndescribed by pexriv and a narrow gaussian line (Sec. 4.1). The\nsharp edge to the transfer function gives the steep drop of the\nblue wing of the iron line, while the deep edge in the ionised\nreflected continuum is smoothed into a broad feature. There is a\nfairly steep drop in the data at 7.2 keV so this model can match\nthe curvature seen (see Fig. 2). The black line shows the best-\nfitting extremely smeared CDID model (Sec. 4.2). The line and\nedge are now mostly blended together, intrinsically broadened by\nComptonisation in the intensely irradiated, hot upper layers of\nthe reflecting slab. Relativistic broadening further smooths the\nspectrum, so there is no sharp drop at 7.5 keV. Since this drop\nis present in the data, this model is a worse fit despite it being\nphysically more realistic. The arrow shows the energy inferred\nwhen fitting an additional absorption line to the data.\nusing the extremely smeared, highly ionized CDID reflec-\ntion. The upper layer of the irradiated reflecting material\nis hot, so Comptonizes much of the line and edge, blending\nthem together and making an intrinsically rather smooth\nspectrum (Ross et al. 1999). Convolution of this spectrum\nwith relativistic effects makes it even broader, so there is\nno sharp change in curvature produced by the blue wing\nof the line. Since the data does have a sharp drop at 7.2\u2013\n7.8 keV then these more physically self consistent models of\nreflection give a worse fit. The significant residuals in the\nspectrum at \u223c7.5 keV then are better fit by including out-\nflowing absorption, predominantly resonance iron K lines at\nrest frame energies of 6.7 and 6.95 keV. The drop seen in\nthe data then no longer drives the relativistic line profile to\nextreme parameters and the derived smearing is completely\ncompatible with a truncated disc.\n4.5 Summary of MECS fits\nThere is a clear broad residual associated with iron in these\nBeppoSAX data from XTE J1650\u2013500. Simple models of re-\nflection, which ignore Comptonization of the line, require\nthat the relativistic effects are extreme, implying a spinning\nblack hole and perhaps direct extraction of the spin energy.\nHowever, these models also require that the reflected emis-\nsion is highly ionized. This means that Comptonization of\nthe line and edge is important, making these features in-\ntrinsically broad and blended together. The strength and\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\nTruncated disc versus extremely broad iron line 7\nsignificance of relativistic effects are then determined by the\ndetailed modelling of the intrinsic reflected emission, which\nin turn depends on the (poorly known) vertical and radial\nstructure of the disc. Nevertheless, the current best mod-\nels of ionized reflection always pick out parameters where\nthe innermost radius of the emitting material is much closer\nthan 6Rg , and with radial emissivity rather steeper than ex-\npected from gravitational energy release alone. However, the\nsmearing derived from these (best available) reflection mod-\nels are not robust to changes in inclination, nor to the ad-\ndition of ionized absorption features. While either (or both)\nof these effects can resolve the discrepancy of the inner disc\nradius derived from the line shape with that inferred from\nthe overall evolution of spectral and timing features, a fur-\nther conflict remains which is that the fits favour a reflection\ndominated solution.\n5 MECS AND PDS 2\u2013200 KEV: COMPLEX\nCONTINUUM MODELS\n5.1 Simple reflection models\nTo get more constraints on the amount of reflection requires\ndata at higher energies, so we include the simultaneous PDS\ndata to extend the spectrum up to 200 keV. However, the\nspectrum is now much more sensitive to details of the contin-\nuum modelling due to the wide bandpass, and it is obvious\nthat a power law can no longer be used. Even an expo-\nnentially cutoff power law is not a good approximation to\nthe shape of a thermally Comptonized spectrum over such\na wide bandpass. The rollover at energies close to the elec-\ntron temperature, kTe, is rather sharper than an exponen-\ntial (Gierlin\u00b4ski et al. 1997). Also, there are indications that\nthe spectra can be more complex than predicted by just a\nsingle temperature thermal Compton component, with sig-\nnatures of both thermal and non-thermal electrons even in\nthe low\/hard state (McConnell et al. 2000; Ibragimov et al.\n2005).\nWe use the eqpair continuum model (Coppi 1999) in\norder to model the curvature of the Comptonized contin-\nuum. This computes the Comptonization of seed photons\nby a steady state electron distribution which is calculated\nself-consistently from balancing an initial heating rate with\nCompton and Coulomb cooling processes. The code allows\nthe input heating to be either non-thermal, with electrons\ninjected with a power-law distribution of Q(\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3\u2212s, be-\ntween Lorentz factors \u03b3min and \u03b3max, or thermal, or some\ncombination of both. However, even if all the electron heat-\ning is non-thermal, the self-consistent electron distribution\n(and hence output Comptonized spectrum) can be mainly\nthermal with only a small non-thermal tail if Coulomb colli-\nsions dominate the electron cooling. This happens where the\npower injected in the hard electrons, \u2113h (parameterized as a\ncompactness \u2113 = L\u03c3T \/Rmec\n3; see e.g. Coppi 1999) is larger\nthan that injected in soft photons, \u2113s. Conversely, where the\nsoft photons dominate then Compton cooling is most impor-\ntant, and the electron distribution retains a mainly power-\nlaw shape with only a small thermal component (Poutanen\n& Coppi 1998).\nAs well as calculating the curvature of the Comptonized\nspectrum at high energies, eqpair also computes the low-\nenergy cutoff due to the seed photon distribution. This cutoff\nis typically at a few kTseed, so is within the observed band-\npass for the MECS data. This curvature can make a large\ndifference to the inferred disc temperature and luminosity\n(see e.g. Done, Z\u02d9ycki & Smith 2002), and could potentially\ndistort the inferred spectrum in the red wing of the iron\nline. We assume that the seed photons are the same as the\nobserved disc photons in all the fits below, and fix \u2113s = 10.\nThis continuum complexity means that we cannot eas-\nily use the CDID reflection models since these are tabulated\nassuming a cutoff in the continuum at a fixed energy of\n100 keV. The assumed high energy continuum shape affects\nthe reflected emission at energies above \u223c 15 keV due to the\npredominance of Compton down-scattering. Instead we use\nthe reflection model in eqpair (which is based on pexriv\nbut reflecting the self-consistent continuum from eqpair),\ntogether with a gaussian line. We relativistically smear both\nreflected continuum and line with the laor kernel, now ex-\ntending the bandpass for the convolution calculation from\n0.2\u20131000 keV, and assume an inclination of 45\u25e6. Purely ther-\nmal electron heating gives an (almost) acceptable fit, with\n\u03c72\u03bd = 99.9\/79 for a reflection dominated (\u2126\/2\u03c0 = 2.4\n+1.5\n\u22120.8),\nhighly smeared fit (q = 3.8 \u00b1 0.2, rin = 1.8\n+0.3\n\u22120.1). How-\never, purely non-thermal injection models give a significantly\nbetter fit, with \u03c72 = 82.7\/78 (there is one extra free pa-\nrameter which is the spectral index of the power law elec-\ntron injection). The subtle difference in continuum curvature\nmeans that the solution is no longer reflection dominated,\nwith \u2126\/2\u03c0 = 0.72+0.12\n\u22120.08 though it is still strongly smeared\n(q = 3.5+0.3\n\u22120.2 and rin = 2.2\n+0.3\n\u22120.2). The MECS and PDS spec-\ntrum and residuals for this best-fitting non-thermal injection\nmodel are shown in Fig. 5(a).\n5.2 Complex reflection models\nSection 4.2 showed that there are large differences in the\nmodel spectra for ionized reflection. While the CDID reflec-\ntion models concentrate on the spectra below \u223c12 keV, com-\nputing the effects of photoionization and Compton up and\ndown-scattering at low energies, they do not accurately treat\nCompton scattering at higher energies, nor include angle de-\npendent effects, nor allow for different illuminating continua.\nThis contrasts with the pexriv models of reflection which\nhave very approximate ionization balance (Done et al. 1992)\nand neglect Comptonization below 12 keV, but treat Comp-\ntonization at higher energies very accurately, and give the\nreflected emission as a function of observed inclination an-\ngle. pexriv is based on the convolution kernels given by\nMagdziarz & Zdziarski (1995), so can be extended to work\nwith any illuminating continuum.\nPlainly what is needed is a combination of these models,\nusing the better CDID photoionization\/Compton scattering\nof reflection at low energies and the pexriv accurate Comp-\nton down-scattering at higher energies. The most flexible\nway to incorporate this is as a convolution model in xspec,\nso that the reflected spectrum can be calculated for any arbi-\ntrary continuum. We have coded this by finding the pexriv\ncross-section at 10 keV which gives the same 12\u201314 keV re-\nflected spectrum gradient as the CDID models for a given\nionization parameter and illuminating spectral index. The\ncorresponding pexriv Greens functions are used to form the\nspectrum above 12 keV. Below 12 keV the Greens functions\nare assumed to collapse to delta functions, given by the ratio\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n8 C. Done, M. Gierlin\u00b4ski\nof reflected to incident flux in the CDID models, rescaled to\nmatch the normalization of pexriv at 14 keV. This model\nis hereafter called refbal.\nWe use this together with the eqpair continuum model,\nand get a somewhat worse fit than for the pexriv models,\nwith \u03c72 = 102.5\/80 for an illuminating continuum from non-\nthermal injection. This is shown in Fig.5(b) and by contrast\nwith the pexriv reflection, it requires a larger fractional\ncontribution from reflection, with \u2126\/2\u03c0 = 2.0+1.2\n\u22120.7. However,\nboth pexriv and CDID based models require that reflection\nis highly smeared, with rin = 2\u20133.\nWe then include the narrow absorption features from\nxstar ionized absorption. As with the MECS data alone,\nthis dramatically reduces the derived relativistic smearing\nto being consistent with a disc truncated above rin = 6\nfor the CDID reflection models. However, the fit still has\n\u2126\/2\u03c0 = 2.4+0.5\u22120.4 i.e. is reflection dominated, although there\nis a significant contribution from the intrinsic continuum\ncomponent as well.\n5.3 Summary of MECS and PDS fits\nThe inclusion of the PDS data up to 200 keV plainly gives\nmore constraints on the amount of reflection than the MECS\ndata alone. With data only up to 10 keV the amount of re-\nflection is very poorly defined, and the spectrum can be pure\nreflected emission with no intrinsic continuum. Including the\nhigher energy data shows that there is most probably true\ncontinuum present, though the derived reflected fraction is\nsensitive to details of how the reflected and continuum emis-\nsion are modelled. With the pexriv based reflection mod-\nels, the data are consistent with \u2126\/2\u03c0 < 1 as expected for a\ntruncated disc, while the more physical CDID based reflec-\ntion models have substantially more reflection present, with\n\u2126\/2\u03c0 \u223c 2. Both these require extreme smearing and emis-\nsivity, but like the MECS-only fits, the smearing is again\nsensitive to the inclusion of narrow absorption lines from an\nionized outflow for the CDID reflection models.\n6 DISCUSSION\nThe bright low\/hard state spectrum seen by BeppoSAX\nfrom the transient black hole XTE J1650\u2013500 is certainly\nconsistent with extremely smeared, reflection dominated\nemission as claimed by Miniutti et al. (2004). However, it\nis also consistent with much less smearing if there is some\nionized, outflowing absorption which gives narrow resonance\nlines at \u223c7.5 keV. Reducing the amount of smearing makes\nthe reflected iron line consistent with the expectations of\ntruncated disc models, removing the conflict between the\nposition of the inner edge of the cool disc derived from\nthe broad-band spectral shape and QPOs. This is directly\ntestable with high resolution data around the iron line.\nSuch absorbing material is often seen in X-ray binaries,\nespecially those at fairly high inclination angles (Ueda et\nal. 1998; Kotani et al. 2000; Lee et al. 2002; Ueda et al.\n2004), including XTE J1650\u2013500 (Miller et al. 2004a). The\none difference here is that the outflowing material has veloc-\nity \u223c4.5\u00d7104 km s\u22121, much higher than the \u223c500 km s\u22121\ntypically seen in these objects. A low velocity wind would\nbe launched from fairly large radii in the disc, as expected\nfor line driving from the UV emitting region of the GBH\ndisc (Proga & Kallman 2002). By contrast, the much higher\nvelocities required here would need to be associated with a\nlaunch from the inner accretion disc, where line driving is\nnot effective due to the high ionization. This suggests rather\nthat the wind would have to be magnetically driven, and\/or\nbe associated with the jet. We note that these data are taken\nshortly after the time of the maximum in radio emission\n(Corbel et al. 2004), so the inferred very fast outflow could\nbe associated with the jet ejection.\nWe can estimate the mass outflow rate. For a constant-\nvelocity outflow the mass outflow rate at a radius R is\nM\u02d9out = 4\u03c0R\n2nmpfv, (1)\nwhere n is the number density of the outflowing material,\nv is its velocity, f \u2261 \u2126\/4\u03c0 is the fractional solid angle in\nwhich the outflow is directed and mp is the proton mass.\nIn a steady state M\u02d9out is constant for all radii. The column\ndensity measured by the observer is\nNH =\n\u222b\n\u221e\nRin\nndR =\n1\n4\u03c0fmp\nM\u02d9out\nRinv\n, (2)\ntherefore\nM\u02d9out = 4\u03c0fmpNHRinv. (3)\nFor NH = 10\n22 cm\u22122, Rin = 10Rg , v = 0.15c and f \u2264\n1 we find M\u02d9out <\u223c 1.4 \u00d7 10\n16 g s\u22121 \u2248 10\u22123M\u02d9Edd (assuming\naccretion efficiency of 0.1 and black hole mass of 10 M\u2299).\nThis is only about 1 per cent or less of estimated inflow mass\naccretion rate and constitutes a very feasible number.\nOur spectral fitting also shows that this absorption does\nnot make the data consistent with all the expectations of a\ntruncated disc. The best current models of reflection based\non irradiation of a slab of constant density give reflection\nfractions which are much larger than expected for a trun-\ncated disc geometry. This is not necessarily the case using\nthe older pexriv reflection models, which can give much\nsmaller reflection fractions. The difference is due to Comp-\ntonization of the line and edge in the reflected emission as\nit travels through the upper layers of the disc (Ross et al.\n1999). This effect is neglected in pexriv, so the iron edge is\nrather sharp. On the other hand, the CDID reflection is not\ncalculated for the disc temperatures appropriate for Galac-\ntic binaries i.e. 0.5\u20131 keV. In such hot material, collisional\nprocesses alone will ionize iron up to the K shell (Davis et\nal. 2005). By contrast, the CDID models do not include col-\nlisional ionization, and thus require intense illumination to\nionize iron up to the K shell to match the data. This pulls\nthe temperature of the upper layers to the Compton temper-\nature of 1.5\u20132 keV, for spectra with \u0393 \u223c 1.9\u20132 (Ross et al.\n1999; Nayakshin et al. 2000). This is a factor 2\u20133 larger than\nthe observed disc temperature in these data. Thus while the\npexriv models underestimate the width of the line and edge\nby having no Compton scattering below 12 keV, the CDID\nmodels may overestimate it for Galactic binaries. From our\nspectral fits, the derived reflected fraction is sensitive to the\ndetailed shape of this edge. Better models of reflection for\nconditions appropriate to Galactic binary discs will enable\nthis effect to be quantified, removing this as a source of un-\ncertainty.\nThe amount of reflection is also sensitive to the detailed\nform assumed for the continuum. This is not easily defined\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\nTruncated disc versus extremely broad iron line 9\nFigure 5. MECS and PDS data fit with a disc blackbody (dashed curve, green in colour) and eqpair continuum (long-dashed, blue in\ncolour), together with the reflection (dotted, red in colour) from the disc. Panel (a) shows the model with simple reflection, panel (b)\nwith CDID reflection and panel (c) the same, but with ionized blueshifted absorption added.\neven with broad bandpass data. Obviously, the wider the\nbandpass, the more constraints there are on the form of\nthe continuum curvature, but also the more the spectrum is\nsensitive to the detailed form of continuum assumed. Broad\nbandpass data suggest that the spectrum has convex cur-\nvature which can be modelled by an additional soft excess\ncomponent (e.g. Di Salvo et al. 2001; Ibragimov et al. 2005).\nThis makes the intrinsic continuum at higher energies rather\nharder than expected from the observed 2\u201310 keV emis-\nsion, reducing the amount of reflection required to match\nthe data at high energies. Including such a component in\nthe model makes the reflected fraction almost completely\nundetermined and consistent with a truncated disc with\nthe refbal and ionized absorber models. Such additional\ncontinuum complexity is not required statistically from the\nspectral data alone (even with the moderate spectral res-\nolution and broad bandpass of BeppoSAX). However, en-\nergy resolved variability could give additional constraints as\nsuch data can fairly unambiguously pinpoint the seed pho-\nton energy seen by the Comptonizing plasma (Gierlin\u00b4ski &\nZdziarski 2005), so could disentangle the shape of the soft\nemission.\n7 OTHER EXTREME LINE OBJECTS\nMost detections of extreme broad iron lines in GBH are in\nthe very high state (alternatively named the steep power law\nstate) rather than in the low\/hard state examined here (see\ne.g. Miller et al. 2004a). This (typically rather high mass\naccretion rate) spectral state shows strong disc emission as\nwell as a strong, steep high-energy tail, while the power spec-\ntrum of the variability shows a strong QPO which is close to\nits maximum frequency (e.g. McClintock & Remillard 2006).\nThus both spectral and timing properties imply that the in-\nner disc does extend close to the black hole (quite how close\nis difficult to determine due to the complexity of the spectra:\nKubota & Done 2004; Done & Kubota 2005). Thus there are\nno obvious conflicts as for the low\/hard state. There are ob-\njects where the disc dominated spectra imply moderate spin\n(from the Ldisc \u221d T\n4\nmax relation) while the iron line smear-\ning implies extreme spin but these could be explained by the\naccretion flow extending below Rms in the very high state\n(Reynolds & Begelman 1997).\nHowever, there is a more subtle conflict with the ex-\ntreme line in these data which is that the very high state\nspectra typically show strongly Comptonized emission. The\nbroad band spectral shape seen in e.g. the simultaneous\nASCA-RXTE-OSSE data from XTE J1550-564 implies that\nthe inner disc is almost completely covered by material with\noptical depth 2\u20133 (Done & Kubota 2005; Gierlin\u00b4ski & Done\n2003). Thus the spectral shape implies that very little of the\ninner disc is seen directly, so it cannot make much contribu-\ntion to the line emission. Yet the same ASCA data require an\nextreme broad line when fit by pexriv based models (Miller\net al. 2004b). Again, we suggest that resonance line absorp-\ntion in an outflowing wind can modify the derived line width\nand remove these conflicts in the very high state spectra. To\ntest this, we fit the publicly available standard products Gas\nImaging Spectrometer data, as this does not suffer from the\npileup problems of the Solid-State Imaging Spectrometer for\nsuch a bright source. The relativistic smearing required for\na pexriv reflected continuum and narrow line are extreme,\nwith rin = 1.6\n+0.3\n\u22120.4 and q = 3.7 \u00b1 0.3, with \u03c7\n2 = 796.5\/742,\nsimilar to the parameters found by Miller et al. (2004b).\nReplacing this with CDID reflection gives similar extreme\nrelativistic smearing but a worse fit (\u03c72 = 824.6\/744). In-\ncluding xstar ionized absorption improves the fit (\u03c72 =\n805.4\/741), and as in XTE J1650\u2013500 this reduces the rel-\nativistic effects to the point where rin = 31\u221215 (no upper\nlimit) with q fixed at 3.\nThe extreme broad lines inferred in some AGN are sim-\nilarly potentially affected by absorption complexity chang-\ning the line parameters. Here there are as yet no obvious\nproblems with this interpretation, especially as extreme spin\nmight be expected given the hierarchical growth of black\nc\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201311\n10 C. Done, M. Gierlin\u00b4ski\nholes through accretion (Volonteri et al. 2005). Nonethe-\nless, if the apparently extreme GBH iron lines are actually\nconsistent with low spin, normal illumination rather than\nextraction of rotational energy from an extreme spin black\nhole, then it is likely that the AGN discs behave similarly.\nWe note that the recent Chandra spectrum of the most se-\ncure extreme relativistic line, that in MCG\u20136-30-15, reveals\nthe presence of ionized absorption at a similar column and\nionization as that required here to reduce the relativistic\nsmearing to levels consistent with a truncated disc (Young\net al. 2005). Young et al. (2005) checked that this absorption\ndid not change the extreme smearing deduced from a laor\ndescription of the line, but this is unsurprising due to the\nunphysically sharp blue wing of the line produced in such\nmodels (see Fig. 4). Our fitting showed that the relativis-\ntic line parameters only changed significantly when using\nthe CDID highly ionized reflection models as these have a\nmuch smoother intrinsic spectrum around the iron line\/edge\ndue to Comptonization. We urge testing the robustness of\nthe extreme relativistic effects to the inclusion of ionized\nabsorption with more physical ionized reflection models.\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nThe truncated disc\/hot inner flow geometry is very success-\nful in qualitatively (and sometimes quantitatively) explain-\ning many disparate properties of the low\/hard state in GHB.\nIf the radius at which the hot flow evaporates from cool disc\nprogressively decreases as the source approaches the transi-\ntion to the soft state then this can account for the observed\nevolution in spectral and timing properties. However, if there\nreally are detections of substantial amounts of iron line emis-\nsion from cool disc-like material down at the last stable orbit\nin the low\/hard state, then the truncated disc idea is simply\nwrong. Some of the extreme line emission might be explained\nby clumps from a disrupted disc embedded in the hot flow,\nbut this would give rise to only a small amount of line since\nthe covering fraction of the clumps would be rather less than\nfrom a disc, and these are embedded in a hot flow with opti-\ncal depth of around unity, so Compton scattering suppresses\nthe line.\nWe show that the bright low\/hard state spectrum seen\nby BeppoSAX from the transient black hole XTE J1650\u2013\n500 can indeed be interpreted as requiring strong, extremely\nsmeared reflected emission from a disc-like structure extend-\ning down to \u223c 2Rg as shown by Miniutti et al. (2004).\nThese data clearly illustrate the conflict between this and\nthe position of the inner edge of the cool disc derived from\nthe broad band spectral shape and QPOs. The small inner\nradius inferred from the line width also conflicts (though\nmore weakly) with the moderate spin inferred both from\ntheoretical models of stellar collapse and from the observed\nLdisc \u221d T\n4\nmax relation in this object. We show that all these\nconflicts can be removed if relativistic effects on the line and\nreflected continuum are overestimated due to the presence\nof absorption line features in the spectrum. The derived line\nwidth is then easily consistent with normal emissivity and\na disc truncated at \u223c10\u201320 Rg (so giving no information on\nthe black hole spin). The reflection feature are most prob-\nably shaped by strong, but not necessarily extreme, grav-\nity. We suggest that this effect is robust, i.e. that moder-\nate columns of highly ionized absorbing material (predom-\ninantly resonance lines of H- and He-like iron) can always\nreduce the inferred relativistic smearing of a highly ionized\nreflected spectrum. This could then remove the more sub-\ntle conflict seen in the very high state GBH spectra, where\nthe disc should be down close to the last stable orbit (so\nstrong relativistic smearing is expected) but the spectral\nshape shows that the inner disc is mostly covered by an\noptically thick, hot corona. We stress that the presence of\nabsorption at this level is directly testable with high resolu-\ntion data.\nWhile there are no such direct conflicts for AGN, we\nnote that the most secure extreme line candidate, MCG\u20136-\n30-15, has highly ionized reflection (e.g. Wilms et al. 2002)\nand a recent Chandra HETG spectrum shows absorption\nat the same column and ionization (Young et al. 2005) as\ninferred here for XTE J1650\u2013500. We urge a re-analysis\nof these data to see whether the extreme line parameters\nare robust to the presence of absorption when using the\nmore physical reflection models which include self-consistent\nComptonization of the line and edge as opposed to models\nin which the line is intrinsically narrow.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMG and CD thank PPARC for support through a fellowship\nand senior fellowship, respectively.\nREFERENCES\nAbramowicz M.
