It is an established fact in the literature that specific \ngovernance relations exist in different markets, and the mechanisms for financing and co-\nordination of business operations and control of assets and resources are shaped by the local \ninstitutional environment. The modern corporation in its present organisational form is a \nmultinational enterprise that in most cases controls assets in multiple markets, and is therefore \ntied in contractual relationships with local governments, suppliers, customers, and institutions \nbeyond the reach of its home governance structure. The adversarial competitive relationships in \none market are not replicated in another, where different context of the competitive environment \napplies. \n \nThe paper offers two cases of corporate networks (the Japanese Keiretsu and Sogo-Sosha) that \ndiffer from the multidivisional form (M-form) of organization. The analysis of the cases tests \nsome of the premises established in the corporate governance debate and leads to conclusions that \ngovernance, control and co-ordination mechanisms focused on interdependent relationships and \noptimization strategies generate specific advantages in the value-creation process.  \n \nKey Words \nCorporate governance critique, Japanese business networks, Keiretsu, Sogo-Shosha, Shako-\nkai, collaborative governance, managing interdependencies through coordination and \noptimisation strategies \n \n \nIntroduction \nMost of the discussion on corporate governance has been driven by the scholarship research that \nfocuses attention on the Anglo-American corporate system based on publicly traded assets, \ndistributed ownership, separation of ownership from control at corporate level, and the \ndistribution of rents among investors and other residual claimants. The discussion has been \ndominated by concerns with the effectiveness of the Boards of Directors that are supposed to \n                                                          \n1 Journal of International Management, Vol. 11:1, (2005) Special Issue on \u2018Corporate Governance and \nAccountability in Multinational Enterprises\u2019.  \n 2\nrepresent shareholders\u2019 interests, and to exercise a monitoring and control function against the \nopportunistic behaviour of managers. The development of the shareholder system has been \nsought mainly through alignment of the interests between managers and shareholders and \nimprovement of the information asymmetry between them. The present crisis of the system is \nattributed mainly to weak Boards and lack of independency of the outside directors in order to \nexercise their governing role (Gupta, 2002). The remedy of the system is sought to be enhanced \nby more active regulatory intervention on behalf of government, regulators, stock exchanges self-\nregulation, and positive action of the corporations themselves to enhance transparency and re-\nbuild the trust with their stakeholders.  \n \nThis discussion ignores the fact that the modern corporation in its present form is a multinational \nenterprise in most cases, it controls assets in multiple markets, and it is therefore tied in \ncontractual relationships with multiple host-governments and local suppliers, customers and \ninstitutions beyond the reach of its home governance structure. Therefore, the adversarial \ncompetitive relationships in one market are not replicated in another, where different context of \nthe competitive environment applies. \n \nAnother critical question often omitted from the discussion on corporate governance is the scale \nof operations of the multinational corporation (MNC). The very fact that some large multinational \nfirms have annual turnover exceeding the budget expenditure of developed national economies \nsuch as Belgium, or Italy suggests that the scale of co-ordination and control within a \nmultinational enterprise is at the level of co-ordination and control of economic activities within \nnation states. The issues of governance therefore have to be addressed also at the level of public \nadministration, accountability, and power relations between agents that constitute the complex \nsystem of operational units, owned or controlled by the multinational corporation (MNC), all \nembedded in the institutional environment of their location. \n \nThe debate on corporate governance also has not benefited much from comparative analysis of \nthe institutional arrangements that have shaped MNC from different countries and socio-\neconomic systems. The work by Sanford Jacoby (2000) is one of the exceptions that informs this \nperspective, and reaches the conclusions that the \u2018superiority\u2019 of the stock-market capitalism and \nAnglo-American \u2018shareholder\u2019 system for financing and control of global corporate activities \nover the \u2018relational-insider\u2019 system of the welfare capitalism in Germany and Japan may be based \non false assumptions of the sources for productivity growth and managerial efficiency. \n 3\n \nThis paper will not focus on definitional arguments concerning corporate governance. We accept \nthat there is no consensus over what corporate governance is, but there is significant implicit and \ncommon understanding of the concept that derives mainly from agency theory, transaction cost \neconomics and stakeholder theory. According to this body of knowledge (Solomon, et.al., 2004), \ncorporate governance refers to: \n- a process of supervision and control over company management; \n- economic agents giving overall direction to firms; \n- the sum of control and co-ordination activities that compose of the internal regulation of \nbusiness in compliance with external obligations; \n- the system by which companies are directed and controlled; \n- the system of external and internal checks and balances that ensures companies discharge \ntheir accountability to stakeholders (Tricker, 1984, The Cadbury Report, 1992, Cannon, \n1994, Parkinson, 1994, Solomon, et.al., 2004). \n \nIn our analysis we will assume that corporate governance is a system \/ mechanism for allocation \nof resources, control and co-ordination of economic activities at firm level that facilitates \nstrategic direction, accountability, transparency and wealth creation. Economic growth, \nproductivity and efficiency are all seen as deriving from this wealth creation, and in the context \nof increasing corporate social responsibility and accountability. On these grounds this paper \nattempts to address the question on efficiency, scope and scale of governance by examining the \ninstitutional arrangements that govern two distinctive corporate networks taken in the context of a \nsingle regulatory regime in Japan. A comparison of the Japanese Keiretsu network corporations \nand Sogo-Shosha networks tests most of the premises established in the corporate governance \ndebate, and offers two cases of corporate networks that differ from the Anglo-American \nmultidivisional form (M-form) of organization, and both resemble large scale MNCs geared for \ngrowth. \n \nThe \u2018Classical\u2019 Theory of Corporate Governance \nThe observations of the paradoxes of power and control at the level of the modern corporation \nrefer back to Berle & Means (1965) and their work on the consequences from the separation of \nownership and control. Fligstein and Freeland (1995) stylise from the literature three internal \ncontrol problems and even wider range of external control issues that extend the debate beyond \nthe unbundling of ownership and control. The authors argue that the corporation may encounter \n 4\ntensions and conflicts of interests in each of these relationships: 1) the control relationship \nbetween management and workers, 2) relationship between management and shareholders; 3) \ndivision of labour and the subsequent division of power and responsibilities within the \ncorporation or intra-corporate intra-management relationships, 4) relationship with investors and \ncapital markets, 5) relationships with suppliers, 6) relationships with competitors, 7) relationships \nwith the state, with governments and other public institutions. One may only speculate how each \nof these relationships could act as an important contributor to the increase or decrease of \ncorporate productivity and performance. The obsession in the literature therefore with the \nproblems associated with investors\u2019 control that derive from the unbundling of ownership and \ncontrol (Blair, 1995a, Castanias, 2001, Gupta, 2002) is much more about the redistribution of \nrents among shareholders and residual claimants, rather then about improving corporate \nperformance, enhancing corporate capabilities, and capturing the value added by different \ncorporate agents.  \n \nIf we look at the corporate governance as a mechanism for allocation of resources in the economy \nand for creating value-added, then we need to consider all relations between economic agents that \nare critical in determining productivity and efficiency. The relations between shareholders and \nmanagers (ownership and control) no doubt are fundamental to financing corporate growth. So \nare the other relations from Fligstein and Freeland\u2019s list. Shareholders and Investment Fund \nmanagers need to have trust in the working of capital markets in order to make their funds \navailable. Managers and workers and all other actors involved intra-management and intra-\ncorporate relations need to have consent over the operations and the strategic directions of the \nfirm in order to expropriate the invested capital in the most efficient way. Relations with \nsuppliers are critical to achieve superior quality and to increase competitive advantage. Relations \nwith government are critical for the legitimacy of the corporate activities and therefore affecting \nrelations with all other stakeholders. Even relations with competitors are important for \ndetermining industry standards and as a form of self-regulation, avoiding costly and deadly \ncollisions in the market place, and co-ordination the direction of product and process innovation. \n \nThe efficiency arguments that derive from the neo-classical economic theory commence with the \nassumption that shareholders are these entrepreneurs that invest their capital in efficient manner, \nand managers are another type of entrepreneurs, that take risk and make strategic decisions \nthrough which they achieve the ultimate corporate objectives for enhanced performance and \nprofitability. The evidence of the source of efficiency in this scenario is very inconclusive. \n 5\nNeither corporate performance is a direct evidence of efficient allocation of financial resources, \nnor are profitability and share price an evidence for efficient risk taking and managerial co-\nordination of value-added activities. Corporate performance is directly affected by environmental \nfactors, market conditions, and relationships with customers and suppliers before it get noticed \nand sanctioned by the governance structure. Profitability and share price also are affected first by \nthe market conditions, and then by the governance mechanisms. \n \nEconomic growth is affected not only by the mechanisms of financing and control, i.e. a \nparticular corporate governance system, but also by market conditions and location advantages in \ninternational business operations of the MNCs. Therefore economic performance of an MNC is a \nfunction of both governance and strategic decision making. Wealth creation for shareholders and \nstakeholders is a derivative of economic performance of the MNC, and therefore will be hugely \ndependent on the intra-firm and inter-firm structures and relationships that facilitate decision-\nmaking and decision implementation. Any comparative analysis of corporate governance systems \nand models ultimately has to descend to the level of relations, structures, and systems of strategic \ndecision-making and decision implementation in order to reflect on the sources of productivity \nand wealth creation. \n \nBoth issues - the separation of ownership from control and the creation of intra-corporate \nhierarchies - create conflict of interests between different corporate agents, and both generate \nsources of inefficiencies, by allowing politics to take place in the process of managing corporate \nresources. The outcomes of the political process inside the corporation is a critical factor \ndetermining corporate performance before it gets to the accounts seen by independent directors at \nthe Board.  \n \nIndependent political processes take place simultaneously inside the corporation (affecting \ndecision making and decision implementation), inside the Boardroom (affecting the function of \nthe independent directors and the entire Board as an institution), and inside investment funds \n(affecting investors\u2019 attitudes and the certainty of capital supply). Clearly political processes \naffect not only the allocation of capital to productive assets, but also the efficient expropriation of \nthis capital for wealth creation. The argument that stock markets prevent the influence of political \nfactors on the allocative decisions in the context described above is at least imprecise. The \nassumption that derives from this argument, that the stock-market capitalism is the most effective \nway of financing economic growth and wealth creation has to be questioned at least. \n 6\n \nAnother argument that has been raised to support the superiority of stock-market capitalism is the \nquestion of transparency and information supply\/sharing between economic actors. If we take \nHerbert Simon\u2019s (1957) modification of the neoclassical assumption of perfectly rational \neconomic actors, there is a clear statement of the existence of informational asymmetries and the \nproblem of incomplete information. If we add to this problem the cognitive and political \nconstraints experienced by economic actors (independent directors on the Board of Directors, \nInvestment Fund managers accountable to Fund owners, managers in industrial relations dispute, \nor corporate representatives in difficult negotiations with buyers and suppliers), the efficiency \nargument is further weakened. The main efficiency enhancing elements of the corporation that \nremain are the individual contractual obligations (when contracts are enforceable under strong \nand efficient state), and efficient organizational processes and procedures for coordinating the \nvalue added activities (in the hands of insider stakeholders). If we accept that the state and inside \nstakeholders contribute to strong governance in the home market, this raises a major question \nover the governance of subsidiaries abroad where host governments vary in the capability to \nsecure contract enforcement, and insiders are embedded in local set of relations. The discussion \nabove can be synthesized in the following conceptual framework (Fig.1.). \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.

It is the organizational structure in Willianson\u2019s view \n(1975, 1988, 1991) that economises on transaction costs, rather then the governance structure. \nThe governance structure has evolved merely as a substitute to compensate for the inefficiencies \nthat emerge from the separation between the ownership and control. It can be assumed that the \nBoard of Directors in whatever shape it is would not bring value added to the corporation, unless \nit takes direct responsibilities over strategic decision making and implementation. Its monitoring \nand control function does not enhance corporate performance, and may not add value. \nSanctioning managers for opportunistic behaviour is not a value adding activity by itself, but a \nfinal resort when crisis is imminent. The true value-adding activities derive from the co-ordinated \nactions of managers, workers, investors, suppliers and customers among other stakeholders \nwhose influence is observed not only in terms of corporate performance, but also in terms of \neffectiveness of decision making and co-ordination efficiencies. \n \nThe agency theory substantiates most of these arguments on efficient governance. Considering \nthat the corporation is a bundle of contracts, the contracts between managers and shareholders is \nnot different from the contract between the other agents involved in the value-adding activities \n(employees, customers, suppliers).  Investors as owners of stock in the stock market capitalism \ndelegate decision-making powers to agents (managers and independent directors). Ultimately \nagency costs rise not only because of opportunistic behaviour by managers, but also from the \nmonitoring and control mechanisms put in place by stock-holders. The entire corporate \ngovernance system, put in place to protect investors\u2019 interests, represent an institutionalization of \nmonitoring and control procedures, raising costs, and diminishing allocative efficiency. In mature \nmarket economies where contract enforcement is undertaken by the state, monitoring and control \ncosts are shared between the MNC and state institutions. The costs of corporate governance \nhowever, remain at corporate level, reducing the value-added and the wealth, created by the \ncorporation. For MNCs operating in underdeveloped market economies, risks from opportunistic \nbehaviour at remote locations add additional agency costs that have to be absorbed by the \nmultinational, and hence multiple risk-sharing initiatives are undertaken, all eroding the profits \nfrom these international operations. \n \n 8\nHill & Jones (1992) summarise three sources of agency costs from the perspective of agency \ntheory: a) principal\u2019s monitoring expenditure (including the design and management of corporate \ngovernance system, appointment and running of Board of Directors, and all types of shareholder \nactivism); b) agents\u2019 bonding expenditure (managing the intra-corporate accounting process, plus \nall risks of managing relationships with the other stakeholders); and c) residual loss \n(supplementing for risks, taken beyond the home market where specific corporate governance \nand contract enforcement exists. Contract enforcement is an issue in all types of relationships and \nall corporate governance systems. Exit strategies by customers, suppliers, employees, or indeed \ninvestors could harm the corporation and affect negatively its performance, even in the case of \nstrong governance.  \n \nThe agency theory also explains the emergence of other types of business organizations along the \njoint stock corporation with M-form controlling its subsidiaries world-wide \u2013 partnerships, sole \nproprietorships, non-profit organizations and holding companies as well. Different division of \nproperty rights arises in alternative search for efficient deployment of financial resources under \nspecific conditions (Fligstein & Freeland, 1995). Although the idea is that these specific \nconditions are related to specific agency costs (Fama & Jensen, 1983), there could be numerous \nother reasons where one form or another is particularly associated with enhanced performance \nunder certain environmental conditions. \n \nThe overall performance of the corporation is affected by numerous environmental factors and \nnumerous agents that contribute willingly and under contractual arrangements to the value-adding \nactivities. All these agents (workers, employees, middle-level managers) potentially can exit and \nwithdraw their efforts, and therefore damage the corporate performance. In the political process \nof negotiating contracts between all these corporate agents residual claims to the profits may be \nraised, and therefore the allocation of rents may take place almost outside of the corporate \ngovernance system and subsequently off- sight from the shareholders. According to the agency \ntheory, the monitoring and control activities of the Board can not secure efficient contract \nnegotiations and enforcement within the corporation, and this is associated with one of the \nvulnerabilities of the stock-market capitalism. \n \nTransaction cost theory uses very similar terminology to the agency theory to describe the same \ncorporate governance issues and problems (Solomon, et al., 2004). Both theories assume bounded \nrationality and opportunistic behaviour by managers. However, transaction cost theory explains \n 9\nthe conditions under which a corporation undertakes vertical and horizontal integration, adding \nnew business units, and how a corporation expands its operations internationally. Both theories \ndo not follow through this logic and do not explain how internationalisation of operations \nstretches the boundaries of the corporate governance system established at the home market. The \nincreased scope and scale of operations ultimately transfer more strategic decision-making power \nto agents beyond the reach of the monitoring activities conducted on behalf of the \u2018principle-\nowners\u2019. \n \nThe institutional and evolutionary economics has also made a contribution to the debate by \nadding more questions regarding the efficiency of the Board of Directors as a governing \ninstitution. Both disciplines have evolved mainly as a critical theory in argument with the \nclassical and neo-classical economic paradigm. In this endeavour institutional economists have \nagreed upon assumptions, systematically analysed by Hodgson, 1988), such as: \n- recognition of the importance of institutions, i.e. rules, procedures, practices and \norganisational arrangements that frame economic decisions and actions; \n- acknowledgement of the chronic information problems undermining the fundamental \nprice mechanism governing market relations; \n- the habitual nature of human actions, conditioned by institutions and past legacies, or the \nwell known \u2018path-dependence theory\u2019;  \n- acknowledgement of the purposefulness and strategic choice in human action, or the \nability of actors to change both their behavioural trajectories and their goals; \n- disequilibrium is the driving force behind development and growth; \n- the continuous transformation of productive and organisational technologies, impacting \non exchanges, transactions, and decision-making; \n- a variety and a complex set of relations affecting production and exchange; \n- the preferences of economic agents are endogenous, suggesting that decision-making is a \nfunction of the relational context and environmental constraints embedding human \nactivities and work relationships; \n- individual preferences (or motives) can be both transitive (affected by the price \nmechanism) and intransitive (an individual attribute preconditioned and determined \nwithin specific cognitive frameworks, and endogenously derived at). Preferences also are \nreflexive, i.e. subject to change under the acquisition of new experience, knowledge and \nlearning, and individual adaptation; \n- knowledge and learning make a significant impact on decisions and human actions; \n 10\n- the preconditions for innovation are a combination of variety (through market \ntransactions) and stability (through organisational rules, institutional norms, and \npractices). The later includes institutional intervention at knowledge creation, \ndissemination and utilisation phase;  \n- agents are seen to be maximising \u2018expected utility\u2019 and optimising behaviour (Hodgson, \n1988, p. 76), rather then maximising behaviour. Provided computational difficulties, \nlimited information, abundance of sense data, and the sense-making communication \nprocess, agents are more likely to optimise towards expected utility, rather then maximise; \n- prices act as market signals only within some cognitive frames of \u2018price levels\u2019 and \u2018price \nnorms\u2019 known by the individual, and established via individual observations or practical \nexperience in exchange situations; \n- firms and other institutions emerge in order to eliminate the radical uncertainty that a \nsigned contract will be completed, i.e. creating a compulsory framework for compliance \n(rather then a voluntary withdrawal from opportunism. \n \nInstitutional and evolutionary economics challenge the fundamental assumptions behind agency \ntheory. Unfortunately, very few of their arguments have entered the corporate governance debate. \nOne of the most popular is the path-dependence theory that argues for the historical and socio-\npolitical embeddedness of economic institutions, determining their working and effectiveness. \nThe path dependence principle can be applied not only to the development of the corporation, but \nalso to the development of its governing institutions, constrained by their own histories, and \nlocked in self-enforcing development loops. The governance system is not expected to match \nperformance and it remains unchanged in cases of both good and poor corporate performance. \nAttempts are made by investors to tied-up the interests of inside directors with corporate \nperformance through incentive realignment. Overall the corporate governance mechanisms are \nseen as a bundle of monitoring, control, incentive realignment and shareholder activism, and it is \nrecognised in the literature that there is a threshold below which investors are not capable to \nexercise any control, but can only exit. Shareholder activism to exercise monitoring and control \nover the corporate management (representing strong governance) is associated with both good \nand poor performance, and paradoxically accelerates monitoring and control costs which \nundermine corporate efficiency. The tension becomes evident in situations of crises when poor \nperformance can not be explained by weak governance as shareholder activism is high (Ward and \nRodriguez, 2004).  \n \n 11\nFrom institutional economics perspective weak governance may be a result of inadequate \ninformation, insufficient learning and knowledge creation, intransitive preferences of agents that \nobstruct innovation and adaptation, or particular relations affecting negatively the corporate \nactivities. Most of these factors are not very easy to manage whatever shareholder intervention \ntakes place. The outcomes depend very much on the good will and good practices established \nwithin the corporation, which depend on the cultural and relational context of the business. This \nclearly suggests that the governance mechanisms in multinational corporations will have a \nvariable efficiency between the home country and the host countries. This creates additional \ndifficulty to regulate governance reforms, as the governance mechanisms designed for MNCs \nneed to have intrinsic flexibility that corresponds with the environmental and relational contexts \nin the host countries. \n \nThe institutional environment affects not only corporate performance, but also Board \nperformance, or the working of the governance institutions as well. The empirical research by \nPettigrew and McNulty (1995) shows clearly that the power of outside directors to exercise a \npositive effect on the corporation is limited not only by the Chairman of the Board who \neffectively runs the Board and can manipulate discussions, but also by contextual factors such as:  \n- personal capabilities and legitimacy,  \n- the need to maintain a positive attitude in this collaborative settings,  \n- political will and interpersonal skills in building Board coalitions,  \n- the need to subscribe to norms and expectations that derive from the role of outside \ndirector,  \n- the learning time required to grasp the complexity of the corporation, and  \n- the interpersonal dynamics that emerge  as an outcome of the selection of board members \n(Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995).  \n \nThe effectiveness of the Board as a monitoring and control devise (or institution) is rather \ncircumstantial. How agents adapt to these circumstances is essential, and the robustness of the \ngovernance institution may depend on it. Selecting Board members of MNCs is complicated not \nonly by their personal constraints and capabilities, but also by establishing the complementarities \nof knowledge that different board members possess, and how adequate it is to technology \ninnovation and foreign market entry in order to drive the developments in corporate activities. \n \n 12\nMargaret Blair (1995a,b) launches her critique over the assumptions underpinning the current \nCorporate Governance paradigm from alternative perspective, revisiting the ownership rights and \nresponsibilities issue under distributed control conditions. She describes the corporation as a legal \nstructure that governs the relationships between all parties that make special investments in the \nwealth-creating activities of the firm. From this position the distribution of rents is negotiable \nbetween all claimants (suppliers, lenders, customers, employees) where the value of the \nspecialized investments contributed by each party depends on the ongoing relationships between \nthem. As a bundle of resources the financial capital is tied up to the human capital in corporations \nand it is not easy to attributed ownership to distinctive parts. Hence the corporate performance \nshould be measured in a way to capture the real value-creation from all employed resources, \nrather then the value-restructuring through corporate takeovers, mergers, sell-offs, buy-outs and \nother asset-restructuring exercises undertaken by corporations and captured by the share price \n(Blair, 1995a).  Blair also concludes in a very eloquent statement that \u201c\u2026corporate governance \ndiscussions that start from a premise that shareholders are the sole \u2018owners\u2019 of the corporation, \nthat measure wealth creation only in terms of the share price of corporate stock, and that focus \nonly on the power relationship between shareholders and managers have the emphasis wrong. \nReforms built on this premise may even destroy wealth-creating capacity\u201d (Blair, 1995b, p.17). \nThis statement does not include acknowledgement of the additional cultural and institutional \ndifferences that entangle the processes of the MNCs, and the value-creation and value distribution \nbetween home and host market economies. \n \nAnother realistic view on the Anglo-American centered governance system points to the \nevolution of the financial instruments designed to diminish the value of corporate risk and debt \nthrough securitization, which takes off the balance sheet a number of critical performance \nindicators. Susan Bies (2002) in her speech refers to financial engineering and risk-management \npractices such as asset-backed commercial securitization, derivatives, options, futures, forwards, \nthat transfer risk exposure outside the corporation, providing liquidity and reducing funding \ncosts. In this environment of declining values of equity and debt, the new rules for disclosure of \noff-balance sheet transactions obviously aim to compensate for managerial ingenuity in hiding \nrisk. At the same time there is already a pessimistic opinion that even the new rules can not \nguarantee full transparency due to the variable outcomes from risk-management techniques. \n \nHaving raised all these criticisms, it is important to look at other alternative governance systems, \nand to compare the stability of relationships under different institutional arrangements. \n 13\nComparison of the Institutional Arrangements within the Stock-Market Capitalism and the \nWelfare Capitalism \n \nThe literature on comparative governance systems is generally split into two streams. The first \naccepts the Anglo-American centric view that the most productive organizational form is the \nMultidivisional corporation (M-form), and the most effective form of corporate governance of the \nMNC is associated with the separation of ownership from control, financing through the stock \nmarket, and the use of independent Board of Directors. The other stream is looking at specific \nnational institutional arrangements that facilitate the relationship between the corporation, \ninvestors, government, suppliers and customers, or the concept of the embedded corporation, as a \nnetwork of affiliated wealth creating units, agents and institutions. \n \nSanford Jacoby (2000) describes these two paradigms as \u2018stock-market capitalism\u2019 and the use of \nshareholder governance system (SGS) and \u2018welfare capitalism\u2019, and the use of relational-insider \ngovernance system (RIGS) that is based on dedicated capital and insider allocation of resources -\nsuch as the systems in Japan and Germany. The strongest control device of the SGS is the exit by \nshareholders or independent directors (Jacoby, 2000), labelled as the \u2018market for corporate \ncontrol\u2019 with its two-tiers (independent directors and shareholders). The notion of independent \ndirectors has emerged to control the behaviour of executive directors in order to protect investors\u2019 \ninterests. The strongest control device of the RIGS system is a strategic Board that comprises of \nrepresentatives from investors with the largest holdings of corporate assets and management \ndirectors engaged in collaborative decision making. In the RIGS system shares are also held by \nkey customers, suppliers, and allied corporations on a reciprocal basis (Jacoby, 2000), a fact \nacknowledged also in the literature as \u2018alliance capitalism\u2019 (Gerlach, 1992b).  \n \nJacoby (2000) explains the emergence of the two distinctive governance systems with the \ndifferences in the legal protection of ownership rights. In the Common Law countries such as US \nand UK the courts were effective in protecting investors\u2019 rights against \u2018monarchical\u2019 (or state) \nexpropriation, and against insider dealing. At the same time the Civil Law countries offered much \nweaker protection of ownership rights, and hence the tendency towards concentrated ownership \nand control by the Banks (Jacoby, 2000). Although this is a very convincing argument, it does not \nexplain, for example, the differences between UK and US, i.e. the US system is geared much \nmore towards litigation, while the UK system is oriented towards conciliatory practices (Philips, \n2002).   \n 14\n \nThere seams to be an overwhelming opinion that in spite of some signs of convergence, the \nevolution of governance systems world-wide is shaped by national institutions and \ncircumstances, and is taking off in separate directions. For example the current reforms in the US, \nled by Sarbanes & Oxley report put much emphasis on independent directors, even stricter rules \nfor financial disclosure, and Chief Executives and financial directors to swear to the accuracy of \ntheir financial reports. At the same time, in the UK following the report by Higgs (Higgs, 2003), \nthe emphasis has shifted towards professional qualities of the non-executive directors, and \nadopting voluntary codes of self\u2014regulation, allowing corporations to adapt more gradually to \nchanging stakeholder expectations (Economist, 2002).  To contrast this with the governance \nsystem in continental Europe, German Law puts responsibilities for the accounts on the \nManagement Board, the Supervisory Board and the Auditors collectively, allowing the system to \nfind a balance between the interests of investors sitting on the Supervisory Board, and the \nExecutive Managers. In France the government and the public administration takes direct \nresponsibilities to influence large French corporations through industrial policy measures.  \n \nAlthough the role of institutional investors has increased throughout the world, it is also taking \ndifferent forms. In Japan the largest public pension funds that manage over US$1.6 trillion have \nformed a Council of Public Institutional Investors, and are collectively discussing portfolio \ninvestment strategies and administration, managers\u2019 evaluation techniques, new investment \ntechniques, regulatory changes and fiduciary responsibilities, and cases of institutional investors \nin other countries (Feinberg, 2002). These collective efforts go far beyond the Council of \nInstitutional Investors in the US, engaged primarily in monitoring and benchmarking of corporate \nperformance and lobbying (Rodriguez & Ward, 2004). The Japanese Institutional Investors \ndemonstrate willingness to share responsibilities both for shaping their institutional environment \nand moderating the risk of their portfolios \u2013 another example of optimizing behaviour contrasted \nwith the maximizing objective in a classical competitive environment. \n \nIt is evident that comparative analysis of corporate governance systems and practices enriches the \nacademic framework that deals with the problems of corporate governance. However, much of \nthe comparative research does not take into account deep enough the criticisms to the Anglo-\nAmerican corporate governance system either from the agency theory point of view, or from the \ninstitutional perspective. The convergence\/divergence debate also has not been followed through \nsystematically from Corporate Governance perspective. Jacoby (2000) argues that parallel to \n 15\nconverging business practices at the level of financing and control of MNCs, the institutional \nrigidities created by path dependence, the absence of a micro-economically superior model of \ncorporate governance, the serious doubts about direct relationship between corporate governance \nand macroeconomic performance, create a platform for multiple development trajectories. The \nfollowing part reviews two distinctive governing practices in the context of the Japanese system \nof \u2018alliance capitalism\u2019. The purpose of this comparison is to highlight two distinctive forms of \ngovernance of large networks that have evolved within a common institutional environment. \n \nThe Japanese Keiretsu and Sogo-Shosha Corporate Networks \nAmong the evidence of convergence between the \u2018stock-market governing system\u2019 and the \n\u2018relational-insider system\u2019 are the changes that are taking place in Japan. These are: the large and \nliquid market for corporate equities, the governance reforms in the 90\u2019s permitting a number of \nstock-market practices established in the US capital markets (such as equity swaps and stock \npurchases by corporations), and banks engaged in liquidating shareholdings (Jacoby, 2000). \nHowever, these changes are slow and superficial, as they do not lead to a radical transformation \nof the corporate governance system. Jacoby also reaches the conclusion that there are limits to \nconvergence, and that a path which is locally efficient is not necessarily globally efficient. There \nare mechanisms which act as complementarities and substitutes in different historical and \ninstitutional settings. For example the very high innovation rates in Japan are a result of big-\ncompany funding and corporate spin-offs, rather then venture capital like in the US (Jacoby, \n2000). If we consider that venture capital is one of the attributes of the stock-market capitalism \nthen it is very difficult to explain that it has high profile in the US economy and its profile in the \nUK has diminished. This is evidence of divergence within rather then convergence across \ngovernance systems. Arguments about the superiority of one of the governance systems discussed \nabove are difficult to sustain due to fundamental differences in the pace of economic growth. At \nthe same time comparative research can identify specific governance mechanisms within each \nsystem that enhance efficient allocation of resources and effective control over the management \nof these resources. \n \nThe aim further in this paper is to compare two Japanese cases of governance of corporate \nnetworks \u2013 the Keiretsu governance and the Sogo-sosha governance with the purpose to identify \nspecific institutions and mechanisms within the welfare capitalism that facilitate economic \ngrowth and wealth creation.    \n \n 16\nJapanese zaibatsu \/ keiretsu \nThe history of the big business groups in Japan keiretsu starts with their pre-war establishment as \nfamily-controlled business networks called zaibatsu, or giant trading conglomerates that ran most \nof pre-World War II Japanese industry. The historical Japanese family business zaibatsu \nresembled a closed intra-family corporation, where family investors were not able to take back \ntheir own investments, and some family businesses remained undivided for more than 300 years \n(Numazaki, 2000).  \n \nAs a form of business organisation, zaibatsu was controlled by a family council Shacho-kai, and \nthe change of the number of partners took place only through family adoption, by marriage, or by \nbirth and death. The difference in inheritance law in Japan and China, is perhaps one of the most \nsignificant factors historically that led to the consolidation of the family power in Japan and \nKorea, compared with its relative fragmentation in China or other countries with similar legal \narrangements.  \n \nThe zaibatsu institution combined the wealth of rich merchant families, the organizing \ncapabilities of warriors, and the expertise of university graduates in order to create large-scale \nfamily controlled conglomerates. Zaibatsu represented also a corporate network and was an \norganisational form, that emerged in response to market failures at the time of Japan's early \nindustrialization after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 (Hirschmeier and Yui, 1981, Imai and Itami, \n1984, Lynn and Rao, 1995). The market failure at that time is described as the inability of capital \nmarkets to allocate efficiently resources to entrepreneurs because of the lack of an infrastructure \nto mobilize savings and to facilitate risk assessment for investment in new business ventures, \nespecially, in industries such as mining, steel and shipbuilding (Lynn and Rao, 1995). Jacoby \n(2000) also puts forward the arguments that Japan, like Germany, France and other European \ncountries experienced the pressures of late industrialisation catch-up, and the state played an \nactive role to mobilise national resources in order to level up with already industrialised Britain. \nThe relational governance system allowed the Japanese government to protect infant industries \nand to allow them to grow. Although with the development of Tokyo stock market an alternative \nmechanism of financing investment and growth was established, the old tradition prevail until the \nmost recent consolidation across the financial sector in Japan. \n \nThe new enterprise system in the 20th century comprised of narrowly focused and inter-linked \nfactories, effective at transferring new technologies between the Western economies and the \n 17\nJapanese economy (Imai, 1992), and possessing 'permeable boundaries' that enabled them to gain \neconomies of scope (Fruin, 1992). Part of the system were the zaibatsu in-house 'organ banks', \ninsurance and trust companies, that enabled the zaibatsu to overcome the weakness of the \nJapanese stock exchanges, and to mobilize and channel financial resources to entrepreneurial \nventures (Lockwood 1954). The retained profits were allocated to new ventures through internal \nfinance and budgeting systems, which facilitated endogenous growth.  \n \nOn the one hand, the zaibatsu controlled constituent units through stock held by the holding \ncompany, through centralized purchasing and sales functions, and through despatching directors \nto manage subsidiary units. The holding company exerted authority over the constituent units to \nreconcile incongruent goals and aspirations. On the other hand, the zaibatsu were market-like \norganizations to the extent that constituent units behaved independently and competed for \nresources, and some of them acted as entrepreneurial organizers of economic activity (Gerlach, \n1992a, Lynn and Rao, 1995). \n \nFig. 2: Japanese Keiretsu Business Networks \n \n\u2022 Institution-centred 2-tier governance system \n\u2022 Multi-level boundaries of corporate units with interlocking ties \n\u2022 Resource & capabilities-based division of labour \n\u2022 Managing through co-ordinating interdependence \n \nIn the post-War period, serious attempts to dismantle the Japanese holding companies were made \nby General MacArthur and the occupation forces in 1946. Subsequently, encouraged by \nShacho-kai\nFirst tier suppliers\nSecond tier suppliers\nGROUP\nBANK\n 18\ngovernment industrial policies, the reunification of formerly connected businesses through cross-\nshareholding and mutual business dealings under the name of keiretsu took place. Many of the \nzaibatsu practices, traditions, and network formations were resurrected. \n \nThe present Keiretsu networks comprise of close, long-term business relationships established by \nlarge corporations with selected groups of smaller firms, financial and trading institutions. They \nrepresent a web of overlapping financial, commercial, and governance relationships, initiated \nfrom a central core to pull-in large segments of the Japanese economy (Gerlach, 1992a, 1992b). \nPresent Japanese inter-corporate keiretsu relationships are considered in terms of three different \nstructural conditions to facilitate interactions: corporate groupings, financial centrality, and \nindustrial interdependency through value chain activities. These groups are not conglomerates as \nthe central holding companies are illegal under Japan's post-war commercial law. The companies \nare independent and publicly owned. However, they are linked through cross-shareholding \ninvestment and the exchange of personnel, through shared debt and equity, and mutual strategic \nplans. The strategic leadership resides within the presidents' club Shacho-kai, where implicit rules \nand shared understandings in unstated \"gentlemen's agreements\" lead to co-ordination and \ngeneral co-operation for mutual benefit (Futatsugi, 1986, Kester, 1991, Gerlach 1992b, \nShimotani, 1995, Tezuka, 1997). \n \nShacho-kai as an institution represents the interests of the inner circle of the keiretsu as a clique \nof firms whose reciprocal commitments stem from long association and strong collective identity \n(Lincoln, et.al., 1996). This association of the presidents holds monthly meetings to discuss \ngroup strategy. It supports group solidarity, mediates intra-group activities, and settles intra-\ngroup disagreements. Keiretsu members can thus develop plans based on activities that other \nkeiretsu members are pursuing. Although it appears that Shacho-kai facilitates insider trading and \nmay be called ineffective allocation of resources, it does provide an efficient platform for \nmanaging intra and inter-corporate relationships, which is a major contributor to wealth creation \nwithin the corporate group. \n \nNumerous firms lacking shacho-kai seats are also tied to the group through their financial and \ncommercial transactions, and through various forms of monitoring and governance. For example, \nmiddle managers of keiretsu firms meet monthly to discuss operations and to co-ordinate \ncorporate activities. This is another effective mechanism for intra-group knowledge management \n 19\nthat facilitates learning and innovation within the group, as well as sharing best practices on a \nwider scale. \n \nOther direct linkages within the keiretsu are represented by the stable corporate cross-\nshareholdings, by dispatch of managers to insider director positions, and by director interlocking \nas control relations that are superimposed on the network of business dealings (Lincoln et.al., \n1996). All these mechanisms lead to alignment of interests among managers within the group and \nwould strengthen the governance framework. In addition, these co-operative relations bring \nintrinsic value to the corporate network as they smoothen the internal negotiations between \nagents, and member firms. These relationships also facilitate co-ordination for innovation, \ndevelopment, and growth.  \n \nRegarding the cross-shareholding within keiretsu networks, share ownership is a symbol of \ncommitment and mutual obligation, rather than motivated by expectations of dividends and \nreturns on investment (Tezuka, 1997). A typical keiretsu core company will have 20% to 40% of \nits stock owned by other companies within the keiretsu. Long-term shareholding agreements with \nother corporations create a situation whereby 60% to 80% of the keiretsu stock is never traded \n(Industry Week, 1992). As the stock market is not the main source of financing for the corporate \ngroup, this limited trading of shares of large Japanese multinational groups is not necessarily a \ndetriment, but could be interpreted as a spare and underutilised mechanism that can be employed \nin cases of financial difficulties. \n \nIn addition to these direct forms of relational governance, there are a number of other indirect ties \nthat bond the commercial and investment activities within the keiretsu, such as: (1) the selection \nof keiretsu trading partners, (2) the amount of borrowing from group banks, (3) the extent of \nshareholding by group banks and corporations, (4) the selection of board members from the \nmanagement of big leading firms (Lincoln, et.al., 1996). These represent specific governance \nmechanisms that enhance international operations, generating both internal and external \nsynergies. \n \nOverall financial and commercial dependencies exist both ways: on the group banks for borrowed \ncapital, and on the group manufacturers and trading firms as buyers and sellers of products and \nservices. However, the \u2018relational-insider\u2019 governance system appears to be better equipped to \n 20\nmanage interdependencies, as it has established institutions, mechanisms and platforms for \nnegotiations, information sharing and enhanced intra-corporate learning. \n \nThere are numerous classifications of Japanese keiretsu, emphasizing on specific aspects of the \nnetwork formation \u2013 vertical, horizontal, supplier-based, bank-centred. Overall there is an overlap \nbetween different categories, and most features are observed in each of the keiretsu. A supplier \nkeiretsu is a vertical group of companies, centred along a major manufacturer, such as Sony, \nHonda, and Matsushita, which run multi-tier supplier networks. As an example of this form of \nbusiness organisation Toyota has more than 60 percent of its parts and subsystems supplied by \nexternal contractors \u2013 tied in long-term contract relations, and Canon is outsourcing nearly 90 \npercent of the value added components in its copiers to related companies (Industry Week, 1992). \nThe vertical keiretsu represents formation that is highly vertically integrated along the value \nchain. It is held together by a complex mix of inter-linked people, financial resources, \ninformation flow, parts and product exchanges, and joint technology development agreements. \nToyota has established a first-tier suppliers' group, the Kyoukoukai (176 companies); Nissan has \nits Takarakai (104 companies). Members of the vertical keiretsu have had little choice but to \naccept this combination of co-operation and competition. Vertical keiretsu is a way to create \ncompetitive teams of inter-linked suppliers, engaged in product and process development  \n(Tezuka, 1997, Kim and Limpaphayom, 1998). This governance form delivers both cost \nefficiencies (within the supply network) and enhanced productivity from co-ordination of \nbusiness activities, technologies and practices. \n \nOwnership is only a part of this linkage: most lead firms have minority shares in their suppliers. \nThe lead firm encourages the second or third supplier to match the first supplier's cost and \nquality, often passing along important technical and process information on the first supplier's \noperations \u2013 a clear example of sharing competences and capabilities between competitors, which \ncreates added value to the group. \n \nThe lead firm tries to avoid monopoly power in its network, thus stimulating all suppliers to be \nmore efficient and price competitive. Suppliers in the same keiretsu group co-operate in projects, \nand yet compete with each other and with outside suppliers to excel in quality, delivery, \nreliability, and cost performance (Tezuka, 1997). This dynamic is an evidence of the positive \neffect of managed expectations that creates collaboration among competitors, and can be \nattributed clearly to the \u2018relational-insider\u2019 governance system. \n 21\n \nThe bank-centred keiretsu are larger than the supplier-only keiretsu and include those headed by \nthe four largest pre-war industrial groups or zaibatsu (Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Fuyo) \nand the two major bank-centred groups, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Group and Sanwa Group. They are also \ncalled Mutual Insurance Systems (Tezuka, 1997). Their member companies come from a variety \nof industries, and they seek to integrate not only vertically, but also horizontally. Although there \nis a deep restructuring of these keiretsu groups triggered by the consolidation of the financial \nsector in Japan and the most recent merger of their group-banks, the literature has described \nsufficient details of their governance system at the pre-consolidation stage. Analysis of these \ngovernance practices is an important element of comparative research and an essential step \ntowards monitoring of the impact of the financial consolidation on the keiretsu governance \npractices.  \n \nFinancial or horizontal keiretsu represent a two-tier corporate governance system, where \ncorporations are linked together through an extensive network of corporate cross-shareholdings, \nand corporate members have close ties to a main bank. The keiretsu bank not only provides \nmember firms with debt financing, but also owns a substantial amount of each firm's equity (Kim \nand Limpaphayom, 1998). \n \nIn normal situations, usually the first stage of group governance intervention is in place, and \ncorporate shareholders provide mutual monitoring through the linkages and institutions described \nabove. When firms are performing well, keiretsu financial institutions do not restrain leverage \nlevels, and keiretsu formations encourage cross-investment and collaboration among corporate \nmembers. Both corporate owners and managers take responsibilities for the higher leverage and \nfor the expansion of trade credits and account receivables as a common source of short-term \nfinancing (Prowse, 1990, Kim and Limpaphayom, 1998). At this stage there is no significant \nrelationship between ownership structure and financial leverage as banks approve and handle \nmost transactions (Kim and Limpaphayom, 1998).  \n \nIn situation of crises and reduced profitability the keiretsu network reacts with a second-stage \ngovernance intervention. The bank assumes control to reduce debt, and acts as an ultimate \ndisciplinarian (Hoshi, et.al., 1990). Keiretsu banks can reduce financial leverage levels of their \nmember firms in several ways: (1) allowing interest concessions, (2) providing equity infusions, \nand\/or (3) writing off outstanding loans. Financial institutions act as both debt- and equity \n 22\nholders, and allow their member firms to carry more debt (Kim and Limpaphayom, 1998). The \nrecent mergers of keiretsu banks are expected to have a positive impact towards increased \nfinancial discipline and reduced debt. This can reduce the banks\u2019 bail-out powers, but it will not \nnegate the other financial mechanisms that have been used in the past to assist group members in \ncrisis situations. \n \nShacho-kai membership ties, as well as trade, debt, and equity ties are stable relations that \nincrease the possibilities for assistance when a partner firm encounters difficulties. Member \ncompanies usually maintain or even increase their equity in the troubled firm. Directors are \ntransferred from the main bank and major trading partners to the firm's board to assist in strategic \nand operational decisions. Network suppliers and customers adjust their contracts to favour the \ntarget firm and transfer technical personnel to its operating divisions. Network members may in \naddition mandate exclusive purchases from the target firm's product line until the crisis has \npassed (Lincoln, et.al., 1996). Enhanced financial discipline as a result of the banking \nconsolidation is expected to raise the criteria for assistance, but it does not change fundamentally \nthe governance system, and may have a limited impact on these practices of cash-flow assistance. \n \nKeiretsu equalizes the fortunes of their members, smoothing inequality in financial returns across \nparticipating firms. Members are not able to maximise their benefits, i.e. extraction of profits and \nrents, but instead have been obliged to optimise output measures. Keiretsu networks are seen as \nclusters of large firms charging each other \"efficient\" prices (i.e., prices in line with their \nrespective opportunity costs) while collectively extracting other market benefits through a \ncollective action for maximizing the joint welfare of all member firms (Lincoln, et.al., 1996).  \n \nKeiretsu members face lower risk than independent companies in Japan, because the whole \nkeiretsu group shares individual risks. Keiretsu companies obtain lower interest rates from both \nkeiretsu banks and other financial institutions, and tend to have higher debt ratios than either \nindependent Japanese companies, or their U.S. counterparts (Tezuka, 1997). \n \nKeiretsu groups also claim to be an effective organisational system of minimising transaction \ncosts, and reaping efficiency gains by economizing on information and control through \nregularized communication and exchange (Williamson 1985). They avert the threat of over-\norganization by keeping their contractual arrangements implicit and their modes of monitoring \nand intervention informal and flexible (Lincoln, et.al., 1996). Keiretsu membership can be \n 23\ninterpreted as a \u2018hedge against future failure\u2019 (Aoki 1988:280). The advantages of keiretsu \ngovernance system are: their flexibility, adaptability, facilitated information and knowledge \nexchange, access to a range of alternative sources of financial assistance, and collaborative \nattitude to problem solving. These are an asset to the Japanese keiretsu groups not only in their \nhome market, but also in their international operations. By integrating the political process within \nthe system, keiretsu governance offers a valuable mechanism in building relationships with host \ngovernments in international business ventures, and other partner firms in multinational alliances, \nor with their foreign subsidiaries. \n \nJapanese Trading Networks - Sogo Shosha \nJapanese trading companies Sogo Shosha emerged since the 17th century and have further \nevolved from providing services as middlemen to their clients and keiretsu members to \ndiversifying in different business areas with higher risk. In building diversified business \nportfolios they have settled as hubs in large business networks, controlling complex flows of \nresources. At various times shosha have acted as commission agents, importing and exporting on \nbehalf of clients; as dealers, trading in their own right; as middlemen in transactions between \nmembers of a keiretsu network; as financiers, lending money to smaller keiretsu members; as \nfacilitators and intermediaries in negotiations with foreign partners; and more recently as \ninvestment-trust managers, venture capitalists, and business consultants (The Economist, 1995). \nThis description suggests that shosha represent the ultimate entrepreneurs, transforming every \nbusiness opportunity into a profitable venture, relying both on own financial resources and \nraising capital from the stock market. \n \nMany shosha are relying on their expertise as oil traders, and are currently repositioning \nthemselves from being traders to operators in infrastructure industries, such as electricity \ngeneration, telecommunications, television broadcasting, and even satellite communications. \nTheir current metamorphosis means shedding their past \u2018low- margin\u2019 role as agents and petty \nfinanciers towards businesses with high profit margins. They often form alliances with foreign \ncompanies in preference to alternative keiretsu partners. Their networks of partners are much \nmore multinational than traditional keiretsu.  \n \n 24\nFig. 3: Japanese Sogo Shosha Business Networks \n \n\u2022 Intermediary-centred governance system utilising mixed ownership & \nconnectivity role \n\u2022 Blurred ownership and control boundaries \n\u2022 Asset-based division of labour \n\u2022 Managing through controlled autonomy & controlled interdependence \n \nAs hubs in their own business networks shosha have always held large shareholdings in other \ncompanies. Some of their investments represent shares in keiretsu firms (The Economist, 1995), \nsome holdings are in their own independent subsidiaries (the shosha have generally preferred to \nrun their own subsidiaries as non- core activities). Now shosha exhibit the new role of Venture \nMerchants. Each of the leading shosha has between 10 and 20 subsidiaries that are eligible to be \nlisted on the Tokyo stock market. Share trading appears to be an attractive business for shosha, \nand a powerful mechanism for the growth of their business network. \n \nThere is virtually no serious academic research on sogo shosha, and most of the information on \ntheir operations comes from daily press and business periodicals. However, they make a clear \ncase of business growth through stock market operations where portfolio investment strategies \nare accompanied by commercial and business development strategies - all bundled under a \nholding formation. Although the holding company is illegal in Japan, and has not been very \npopular in countries with strong stock markets, it experiences a resurrection in developing \nmarkets. A holding company may reap synergies from building a large and loyal customer base \nand from cross-selling of group products and services (Gibson, 2002). A similar family holding \ncompany that demonstrates the case of shosha holding networks is the Ayala Corporation in the \nPhilippines, which has benefited simultaneously from spinning-off subsidiaries, public trading, \ndiversified acquisitions in high-growth market segments, alliance partnerships with MNCs, and \nSogo Shosha\ntrading\ncompany\nForeign partners\nBANK\nKeiretsu\nnetwork\nFirms\n 25\nhedging risks and foreign depth through advanced financial instruments. Being entangled in \nmultiple business relationships does not necessarily diminish the strong family control.  \n \nThe main governance mechanisms of the shosha holding networks appear to be: flexibility in \nfinancing both through own capital and using financial instruments available at the stock market; \nclose hub-and-spoke co-ordination of  related as well as unrelated business operations; \n\u2018employing\u2019 trust relations through family linkages or other informal associations between \nmanagers of individual businesses; actively using stock market financial instruments not only for \nenhancing their return on capital (ROC), but also for reinvestment of this capital in productive \nassets and business operations, and the endogenous growth of their business portfolio.  \n \nBoth cases of Keiretsu and Sogo Shosha resemble much more a holding formation, and offer two \nindependent alternatives to the multidivisional form (M-form) of corporation with public limited \nliabilities and financed through trading on stock markets. Both cases demonstrate that the same \nsocio-economic and institutional environment in Japan has nurtured two distinctive forms of \ngovernance, each of which offers different forms of bundling of ownership and control functions. \nUnder the Keiretsu governance system there are two institutions engaged in monitoring and \ncontrol, and both exercise ownership rights, and actively participate in strategic decision making \nand resource allocation. The Keiretsu Bank and the Presidents\u2019 Association Shacho-kai are the \nmain stock-holders that assume responsibilities and liabilities. Within the Keiretsu system they \nmanage collectively the complex and multi-level network of corporate assets, utilising resource \nand capabilities based division of labour, interlocking resource ties, optimisation strategies, and \nco-ordination of interdependencies. \n \nThe literature on Sogo Shosha does not give many details on the institutional arrangements of \ntheir governance system. However, from the scares descriptions of their operations we may \ninduce that their governance system is centred in the trading firm, which utilises a mixed \nownership and connectivity function, controlling and directing the trading operations of its \nsubordinate assets. The trading firms itself have neither full ownership, nor full control of the \nindependent firms under their sphere of influence. However, Shosha clearly generates value \nadded by facilitating trading and operability of these firms. Its network incorporates asset-based \ndivision of labour which allows the centre trading firm to coordinate multi-level operations. \nShosha\u2019s relationships with its subordinate firms exhibit a mixed form of controlled autonomy \nand interdependence. \n 26\n \nClearly both cases demonstrate governance systems that generate economic efficiencies beyond \nthe specialisation between owners and managers and the effective control over the managerial \nfunction. Re-bundling of ownership and control within the relational-insider system facilitates \ngood reinvestment of capital into economic growth and creates a number of institutions that \nfacilitate smooth negotiation of contract commitments and outcomes. The lack of transparency, \nattributed to this system may be associated with limited accountability, but it is also associated \nwith effective intra-corporate information sharing, learning and innovation. \n \nRegarding their international operations, their governance flexibility and adaptability are a strong \nadvantage compared with the MNC that originate from the Anglo-American stock-market \nsystem. The MNCs subject to the strict regulatory environment of the stock-market capitalism \nhave evolved as a multidivisional form (M-form) of incorporation of subsidiaries, where full \nownership and control is the most desirable relationship from the perspective of the \u2018parent\u2019 \ncompany. The network formation diminishes the costs of hierarchical control and coordination, \nand creates a more fluid structure of interlinked assets. On this basis it can be claimed that the \ngovernance costs of networks are lower compared with the M-form of corporation. Flexibility in \nfinancing investment and growth strategies is another advantage of network governance. Network \nformations also allow for more adaptable approach to managing relationships with subsidiaries, \nwhich will be a particular advantage in international operations. \n \nConclusions \nBoth Keiretsu and Sogo-Shosha resemble business networks coordinated from a centre that is not \nconstrained by the division between major shareholders and executive managers. Shacho-kai is \nan institution developed to handle corporate responsibilities and strategic decision making. \nShosha is a firm that is controlling both repetitive and market transactions, and is engaged \ndirectly and indirectly in operations management. Both cases exhibit a form of re-integration of \nthe ownership and control function. How does this apply to MNCs and global business networks? \n \nThe MNCs have to handle and control multiple transactions in remote locations adopting a \nvariety of co-ordination mechanisms \u2013 most of which have been invented for the purpose of \neffective administration and management of economic activities in organizations and institutions. \nThe complexity of MNC operations requires a complex set of tools used by individual and \ncollective agents \u2013 all engaged in a complex allocation of resources for operational and strategic \n 27\npurposes. In this context the discussion of the decision making power of the individual members \nof the Board of Directors, or the accountability of insider agents to outsider shareholders and \nstakeholders merely reaches the paradox that there are no boundaries to managerial opportunism, \nand enhanced control that assumes tentative opportunism, generates merely more sophisticated \nevasive manoeuvres from executives entrusted to handle operational risks.  \n \nCollaborative governance demonstrates an alternative way for re-alignment of interests of all \neconomic actors, and shortens the cycle for reinvestment of capital into productivity and growth, \ncompared with the portfolio investment mechanism within the stock-market governance system. \nIt facilitates information sharing, learning and innovation that ultimately brings comparative \nadvantage to an MNC, \n \nOwnership rights do not produce automatically enhanced accountability or ethical behaviour. \nBoth of these outcomes require institutional support from a social canvas that evolves historically \nand in a particular legal and socio-economic context. Governance mechanisms taken out of this \ncontext may not work and may not be applicable to other systems. In addition to that, systemic \nchanges are always costly to implement, and require radical approach.  \n \nThis comparative analysis of the governance mechanisms that have evolved under the \u2018relational-\ninsider\u2019 governance system  illuminates some of the advantages of an economic system that have \nfacilitated rapid growth and rapid internationalisation particularly after the Second World War. \nThe criticisms of the welfare governance have been usually raised from a narrow perspective. \nThis paper has widened the analytical scope with the synthesis of the critical arguments from \nagency theory and institutional economics perspective (Fig. 1). The proposed conceptual \nframework can explain why certain elements of the welfare governance bring competitive \nadvantage at firm level. \n \nFurther research into the governance mechanisms behind Sogo-shosha is essential in order to \nexplain the success of this form of business growth. The growing popularity of holding \ncompanies in the rapidly developing economies is evidence of the importance of this corporate \nform for growth and wealth creation. Most of the governance mechanisms discussed in the paper \nare subject to evolution, particularly under the influence of the on-going consolidation of the \nfinancial sector in Japan, and the changes in the regulatory environment. The existing research on \nKeiretsu governance will need updating in the context of the recent merger wave across Keiretsu \n 28\ngroup banks. Comparative and longitudinal analysis is expected to enlighten the debate not only \non systemic changes in Japan, but also on global convergence, and the conceptual framework in \nthis paper is an effort to present a systematic view on the factors that affect corporate governance \noutcomes.     \n \nBibliography: \nAoki, M. and P.
