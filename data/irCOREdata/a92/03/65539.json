However, short-term debt can reduce shareholder\u2019s risk if there is \nuncertainty of future interest rates, since investors cannot easily diversify away inter-temporal \nrisk (Morris, 1976). Consequently, debt maturity can affect firm\u2019s value. Subsequent theoretical \nliterature on the role of debt maturity structure on firm value offers arguments in support of \nseveral hypotheses, from tax (Brick and Ravid, 1985) and liquidity risk hypotheses (Diamond, \n1991), to moral hazard (Myers, 1977; Barnea et al., 1980) and signalling hypotheses (Flannery, \n1986; Diamond, 1991). A host of empirical studies, focusing mainly on firms operating in major \ndeveloped markets, have assessed the validity of these hypotheses (Barclay and Smith, 1995).1 \nOn the strength of both theoretical and empirical results, it is now established that the choice of \ncorporate debt maturity is one of the most important financing decisions, since an inappropriate \nchoice can increase agency costs and lead to inefficient liquidation.  \nDespite this wealth of literature, the theoretical predictions and the supporting empirical \nevidence on the debt maturity decision of firms are mixed. More importantly, little is known \nabout whether, to what extent and how the observed differences in corporate governance and \ninstitutional environment may affect the debt maturity choice of firms2, and most studies analyse \nthe experience of firms under \u2018normal\u2019 market conditions. This paper aims to further address the \ndebt maturity decision and contribute to two new and important dimensions of the literature. \nFirstly, it investigates the potential effects of economic conditions, corporate governance and \ninstitutional set-up on the debt maturity structure of firms in both emerging and more developed \neconomies in the Pacific Basin region. Secondly, it provides the first evidence on the effects of \nthe 1997 Asian financial crisis on the determinants of corporate debt maturity choice of firms \noperating in the region. An improved understanding of these issues should help both financial \n                                                 \n1\n An exception to this is Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999), who analyse the choice of debt maturity structure \nin 30 countries, and show that there are many similarities in the determinants of firms\u2019 debt maturity choice across \ndeveloped and developing markets. \n3 \n \nmarkets and companies to identify the sources of financial risk and how to manage it in \ndifferent, and changing, economic and institutional conditions. \nThe selection of the four sample countries, namely Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and \nAustralia, is based on three important considerations. First, the 1997 Asian crisis affected the \nchosen countries by different degrees. Thus, an investigation of the effects of the crisis on the \ncorporate debt maturity structure of these nations can shed light on how changes in \nmacroeconomic conditions may affect firm level decisions. Second, firms in these countries \noperate under different legal, corporate governance and economic settings, and thus the effects \nof these different environments can be directly addressed. Third, this study extends the current \ninternational evidence on corporate financial decisions in general and the sparse literature on the \nexperience of firms from this region in particular.3 To achieve these objectives the paper \ninvestigates: (i) firm-specific and country-specific determinants of corporate debt maturity \nstructure in the Asia Pacific region; (ii) whether, and how, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 \naffected the corporate debt maturity choice of firms; and (iii) whether the determinants of \ncorporate debt maturity structure are different across countries at different stages of economic \nand financial development.  \n \n2. Economic and Institutional Environment \nEconomic conditions, corporate governance and institutional environments may influence \nthe relationship between managers, shareholders and creditors, as well as investors\u2019 behaviour. \nThis may offer some explanations for the different patterns of financing behaviour observed \nacross countries and regions. The indicators of economic and legal environment summarised in \nTable 1 show that there are variations across the sample countries, and that the ownership \n                                                                                                                                                            \n2\n Exceptions include Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999), Fan et al. (2004) and Antoniou et al. (2006). \n3\n See Deesomsak et al. (2004) for a discussion of the different economic and legal environments in the sample \ncountries and for references to other empirical investigations in this region.   \n \n4 \n \nstructure of firms in this region tends to be highly concentrated leading to higher agency costs of \ndebt. It is expected that this disparity in corporate governance and institutional environment \naffects the relevance of the different potential determinants of debt maturity structure, and \ncontributes to explaining variations across sample countries.  \n[Insert Table 1] \nFirm\u2019s financing decisions may also be affected by unforeseeable economic events, such \nas the Asian financial crisis of July 1997. The effects of this crisis on individual countries varied \nconsiderably and showed the vulnerability of the less developed economies in the region. The \ncrisis originated in Thailand and Malaysia and quickly spread throughout the region. Singapore \nsuccessfully averted the worst effects of the crisis and recovered quickly, while evidence \nsuggests that Australia was not really affected. This is not surprising, because Australia had \ndeeper and more mature financial markets as a consequence of the financial deregulation of the \n1980s, and was not subject to the fatal combination of large volatile capital flows and a fragile \ndomestic financial sector that characterised many East Asian countries. \nIt has been suggested that, in the period preceding the Asian crisis, asymmetric \ninformation problems worsened, and the deterioration of balance sheets eventually led to the \ncrisis. Financial markets were no longer able to allocate funds efficiently.  Firms became more \nconcerned about their debt exposure and creditors more stringent in their lending. The 1997 \nAsian crisis emphasised the importance of a carefully chosen maturity-mix of debt to both firms \nand their lenders. It also highlighted the inefficiency of the corporate governance, legal and \ninstitutional environment in this region, and the consequences of unsound lending decisions and \nlack of transparency. It is therefore reasonable to expect that this economy-wide event may have \nhad a significant impact on the debt maturity decision of firms. \n \n5 \n \n3. Corporate Debt Maturity and Hypotheses Development \nThe main hypotheses identified by the literature on debt maturity structure relate to moral \nhazard, taxation, signalling, and liquidity risk.4 The moral hazard hypothesis emphasizes the \nrole of short-term debt in reducing agency problems, such as under-investment and asset \nsubstitution. Myers (1977) and Barnea et al. (1980) suggest that firms can control the under-\ninvestment problem by shortening the effective maturity of their debt, since when short-term \ndebt matures before growth options are exercised there is an opportunity for firms to re-contract \nand for debt to be re-priced, so that gains from new investment do not accrue to debtholders. In \naddition, Barnea et al. (1980) propose that short-term debt can mitigate the adverse risk \nincentives of debt financing, or the asset substitution problem, because short-term debt is less \nsensitive to risk shifting. Thus, short-term debt reduces shareholders\u2019 incentives to engage in \nhigh-risk projects. In relation to the tax hypothesis, Brick and Ravid (1985) propose an \nirrelevance theorem and identify the specific conditions under which taxation can affect debt \nmaturity. Kane et al. (1985) establish that the net benefit of tax, after allowing for the cost of \nbankruptcy, tends to be very small and thus not sufficient to offset the amortized transaction or \nfloatation costs. In this context, firms should lengthen debt maturity only if the tax advantage is \nhigher than the amortized floatation costs. \nThe signalling and the liquidity risk hypotheses were developed by Flannery (1986) and \nDiamond (1991). When there is asymmetric information between lenders and firms, and in \nparticular managers have better or timelier information about firm\u2019s value than investors, the \nnature of equilibrium is determined by transaction or floatation costs. The market cannot \ndistinguish between good and bad quality firms and a separating equilibrium ensues. Higher \nquality firms prefer short-term debt to avoid paying a market premium on long-term debt that is \ntoo high for their quality, and lower quality firms prefer long-term debt, because the market \npremium on long-term debt reflects a probability of default that is lower than their own. If firms \n6 \n \nconsider liquidity risk, they will trade off the benefits of short-term debt against their liquidity \nrisk.  \n3.1. Firm-Specific Determinants of Debt Maturity Structure \nThe paper applies a the balance-sheet approach5 and defines debt maturity (MAT) as the \nproportion of long-term debt to total debt, where long-term debt includes debt of more than one-\nyear maturity. The firm-specific explanatory variables include leverage, firm size, growth \nopportunities, earnings volatility, liquidity, profitability, share price performance, and asset \nmaturity. Table 2, Panel A, summarizes the relationship postulated by different theories between \nfirm-specific variables and debt maturity, and specifies the proxy measures used. The liquidity \nrisk hypothesis predicts that a firm lengthens its debt maturity as leverage (LEV) increases in \norder to offset the higher probability of a liquidity crisis, and thus delay exposure to bankruptcy \nrisk. Therefore, leverage is expected to be positively correlated with debt maturity. On the \ncontrary however, Myers (1977) suggests that the agency cost of under-investment can be \nmitigated by either reducing leverage or shortening debt maturity. If the former is used, there is \nless need for the latter. Thus, the moral hazard hypothesis predicts a negative relationship \nbetween leverage and debt maturity. \n[Insert Table 2] \n The moral hazard and the signalling hypotheses predict a positive relationship between \nfirm size (SIZE) and debt maturity. In the presence of moral hazard, smaller firms are more \nlikely to experience conflicts between shareholders and debtholders, leading to problems such as \nrisk shifting, asset substitution and claim dilution. The signalling role of debt is also more \nimportant in smaller firms as they might communicate less information to outsiders leading to \nmore informational asymmetries because of economies of scale in information production and \ndistribution. This prediction is further strengthened by a number of other factors. First, managers \n                                                                                                                                                            \n4\n See Ravid (1996) for an extensive survey of the theoretical studies on corporate debt maturity structure. \n5\n Previous studies that applied this approach are Barclay et al. (2003) and Antoniou et al. (2006). \n7 \n \nof small firms are more likely to hold a substantial amount of equity in the firms they manage, \nand thus will tend to be more risk seeking than managers of larger firms. Second, since small \nfirms tend to have more growth options and thus higher agency costs than large firms, debt \nholders tend to reduce the risk of lending to smaller firms by restricting the length of debt \nmaturity. Finally, large firms tend to issue more long-term debt because of easier access to \ncapital markets, while smaller firms rely more heavily on bank debt. Therefore, a positive \nrelationship is predicted between debt maturity and firm size. \n Growth opportunity (GROW) is expected to be inversely related to long-term debt. The \nagency cost of debt is likely to be higher for high growth firms, as new investment can increase \nrisk, and informational asymmetries also tend to increase with growth opportunities. Agency \nrelated under-investment problems can be mitigated by issuing short-term debt that expires \nbefore growth options are exercised. Issuing short-term debt also signals quality to the market \nand avoids the high information costs that come with long-term debt. However, the liquidity risk \nhypothesis predicts a positive relationship because firms can reduce the probability of inefficient \nliquidation of their risky growth opportunities by issuing long-term debt. Kane et al. (1985) \nargue that there is an inverse relationship between the optimal debt maturity and earnings \nvolatility (VOL). Firms with low earnings volatility prefer longer debt maturity to avoid \nfrequent re-balancing of their capital structure. On the contrary, firms with higher business risk \nare prone to higher agency costs, and thus they have an incentive to shorten debt maturity to \nlower agency costs. Therefore, a negative relationship between long-term debt and liquidity \n(LIQ) is expected.  \n Profitability (PROF) is likely to be positively related to debt maturity, because profitable \nfirms have higher taxable income, and thus receive greater tax benefits from long-term debt. \nTaxability can influence firms\u2019 debt maturity because choosing long-term debt over short-term \ndebt can create a tax timing option to repurchase and re-issue debt. Antoniou et al. (2006) link \nthe positive relationship between share price performance (SPP) and debt maturity structure to \n8 \n \nthe signalling power of debt. For instance, if managers perceive that a drop in share price fails to \nreflect the \u2018true\u2019 (but unknown) value of the firm, they have a motivation to send a credible \nsignal to the market. This can be done by issuing short-term debt, as it confirms that managers \nare prepared to be closely monitored and frequently assessed by lenders. Similarly, firms with \nfavourable information tend to avoid long-term debt and issue short-term debt instead, because \nthey hope to negotiate more favourable terms later. The relationship between asset maturity \n(AMAT) and debt maturity is expected to be positive, as firms tend to match the maturity \nstructure of assets and liabilities to reduce the agency costs of debt. \nFinally, several studies (Ozkan, 2000; Antoniou et al., 2006) show that firms tend to set a \ntarget debt maturity ratio. If any deviation from the target occurs, the speed at which firms \nadjust their debt maturity structure towards the target depends on the costs of adjustment versus \nthe costs of remaining off the target. We test for the presence of a target ratio by incorporating \nthe one-period lagged debt maturity in a partial adjustment model. \n3.2.  Country-Specific Determinants of Debt Maturity Structure \nRecent studies show that corporate financing decisions are determined not only by firm-\nspecific characteristics, but also by country-specific factors such as economic conditions, \ncorporate governance and institutional environment (Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1999); \nFan et al., 2004; Deesomsak et al., 2004; Antoniou et al., 2006). Different market conditions can \ninfluence firm\u2019s borrowing decisions by affecting the level of long- and short-term debt and by \ncreating incentives for firms to alter the debt maturity mix. We categorise the country-specific \nexplanatory variables into two groups: (i) market-wide determinants, which include economic \ndevelopment, bank development, stock market development, term structure of interest rates, and \ninflation; and (ii) legal and corporate governance determinants, which include quality of legal \nenforcement, legal protection, ownership concentration, and information intermediary activity. \nTable 2, Panels B and C, summarizes the relationship postulated by different theories between \n9 \n \nthe variables in these two groups of country-specific determinants and debt maturity, and \nspecifies the proxy measures used. \nWith respect to market-wide determinants, Fan et al. (2004) suggest that firms in \ndeveloping countries tend to use far less long-term debt than firms in developed countries. To \ntest for this, a developing economy dummy variable (EDEV) is used. Bank development \n(BKDEV) is expected to be inversely related to debt maturity, because short-term debt enables \nbanks to use their comparative advantage in monitoring lenders. Stock market development \n(MKDEV) is expected to be positively related to debt maturity since market prices transmit \ninformation making lending to quoted firms less risky. However, there is also an incentive for \nfirms in countries with developed stock markets to switch from long-term debt to equity, as the \nadditional liquidity of the stock market encourages risk taking behaviour from well-informed \ninvestors. This could lead stock market development to be negatively related to debt maturity \nbecause firms may want to use more short-term debt to reduce agency costs.   \n The tax hypothesis predicts that firms should employ more long-term debt when the term \nstructure of interest rates (TERM) slopes upward. Brick and Ravid (1985) show that different \ntime patterns of interest payments can affect the choice of debt maturity of firms. They suggest \nthat firms lengthen their debt maturity when the term structure is upward sloping, because the \ntax-shield value of long-term debt is higher and because the interest tax shield of debt is \naccelerated by increasing the proportion of debt payments. Thus, issuing long-term debt can \nincrease firm\u2019s value. Graham and Harvey (2001) find that the yield curve influences the \nmaturity of new debt. In this respect, market timing predicts that at times of high interest rates \nfirms prefer to issue short-term debt while they are waiting for long-term interest rates to decline \nin future. Finally, there is some evidence that an increase in inflation (INF) tends to reduce the \nuse of long-term debt by both large and small firms (Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic, 1999), \nsince debt contracts are generally based on nominal terms and thus high inflation may increase \nthe interest rate risk faced by firms. \n10 \n \nThe quality of legal enforcement is measured by the level of corruption (CORR), which is \nexpected to be negatively related to corporate debt maturity. When the legal system has less \nintegrity, or is inefficient, debt is used more than equity financing, and short-term debt more \nthan long-term debt, since a shorter maturity limits the firm\u2019s opportunity to expropriate \ncreditors.  Creditor rights (CRR) and shareholder rights (SHR) indexes are used to measure \nlegal protection. Diamond (1991) argues that lenders who engage in monitoring have incentives \nto lend short-term. Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999) also suggest that strong creditor \nrights increase the incentive of banks to monitor firms. Shareholders\u2019 protection, on the \ncontrary, decreases the agency cost of debt. Consequently, in countries with strong shareholder \nrights, firms should need less short-term debt to mitigate agency problems. Therefore, debt \nmaturity is expected to be negatively (positively) related to creditor rights (shareholder rights). \nWhen ownership concentration (OWN) is high, the interests of shareholders and managers \nalign, leading to higher agency costs of debt. Therefore, the moral hazard hypothesis predicts \nthat firms in countries with high ownership concentration should issue more short-term debt in \norder to mitigate agency problems. This suggests a negative relationship between ownership \nconcentration and debt maturity. Finally, since auditors enhance the credibility of public \ninformation by certifying the firm\u2019s accounts their presence should diminish the role of short-\nterm debt in mitigating information problems and lead to a positive relationship between \ninformation intermediary activity (AUD) and debt maturity. \n \n4. Data and Methodology \n4.1. Data \nThe sample comprises of a panel of all firms in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and \nAustralia, listed in the national stock exchanges over the period 1993-2001. Financial firms and \nfirms with missing observations are excluded. Firm\u2019s financial data are obtained from \nDatastream. The final sample consists of 1,726 observations for Thai firms, 2,493 for Malaysian \n11 \n \nfirms, 1,164 for Singaporean firms, and 809 for Australian firms. Because of the requirement of \nthe Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) methodology that firms with less than three \nconsecutive observations are also excluded, fewer observations are used when using GMM. \nTable 3 presents the averages of the variables used in measuring debt maturity, firm-\nspecific and market-wide determinants. Countries are combined by how severely they were hit \nby the crisis, with Australia and Singapore being the least affected and more developed \neconomies, and Malaysia and Thailand the most affected and emerging economies. Table 3 \npresents initial evidence of significant differences in debt maturity pattern and determinants \nbetween the two country groupings. Firms in developed economies have more long-term debts \nthan firms in emerging economies. The financial crisis had several significant effects on most \nfactors, more so in the countries most affected by the crisis. Overall, the crisis led firms in this \nregion to issue higher debt on average, as equity issues became problematic in unstable markets. \nGrowth opportunity and share price performance decreased significantly after the crisis, while \nasset maturity increased. Profitability changed significantly after the crisis in the countries most \naffected. Market-wide factors also changed considerably.  For both country groupings, bank\u2019s \nassets became larger relative to GDP. Stock markets were most severely hit in the countries \nmost affected. Short-term interest rates increased (decreased) relative to long-term rates for the \ncountries most (least) affected by the crisis. For both country groupings, inflation decreased \nafter the crisis, and volatility of earnings and liquidity of firms were affected significantly by the \ncrisis. These initial observations further motivate an analysis of the changes in the determinants \nof debt maturity structure after the Asian crisis.  \n [Insert Table 3] \n 4.2. Methodology \nTo test for the existence of a target optimal debt maturity structure, lagged debt maturity is \nincluded in a partial adjustment model as in Ozkan (2000) and Antoniou et al. (2006). If a firm \nhas a target debt maturity ratio, the coefficient of the one-period lagged debt maturity is between \n12 \n \n0 and 1. If the cost of diverging from the target is higher than the cost of adjustment, then the \nspeed of adjustment (measured by 1 minus the coefficient of the lagged debt maturity) is \nexpected to be faster (higher).6 To examine the role of firm-specific determinants of debt \nmaturity, the individual firm\u2019s debt maturity structure is modelled as a function of k firm-\nspecific factors and its one-period lag for each country as follows:  \n, 0 1 , 1 , , ,\n1\n(1)\nN\ni t i t k k i t i t i t\nk\nY Y FF\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b1 \u00b5\n\u2212\n=\n= + + + + +\u2211  \nwhere, Yi,t is firm i's debt maturity at time t; FFk,i,t is a vector of firm i\u2019s k firm-specific factors; \n\u03b1i and \u03b1t represent time-invariant unobservable firm-specific effects and time-specific effects \nwhich are common to all firms at any one time but vary through time; and the disturbance term \n\u00b5i,t is time-varying and serially uncorrelated with mean zero and variance \u03c32. \nAs shown in Antoniou et al. (2006), GMM-SYS is the most appropriate method to \nestimate equation (1).7 Wherever appropriate, we use the more efficient two-step GMM \nestimator. The suitability of instruments is confirmed by the Sargan test. As shocks that affect \ndebt maturity structure may also affect other firm-specific factors, all explanatory variables may \nnot be strictly exogenous. Therefore, the dependent variable is treated as endogenous and the \nexplanatory variables as weakly exogenous. \nTo test for the importance of economic conditions on corporate debt maturity structure, the \ndata for the four sample countries are subsequently pooled to create one panel. Due to the nature \nof the data, equation (2) below is estimated using OLS instead of GMM-SYS: \n, 0 , , , , ,\n1 1\n(2)\nN N\ni t k k i t m m j t t i t\nk m\nY FF CD\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03c9 \u03b1 \u00b5\n= =\n= + + + +\u2211 \u2211  \nwhere the notation is the same as in equation (1), and CDm,j,t refers to a vector of country j\u2019s \ncountry dummy m, taking the value of 1 for Thailand (THDUM), Malaysia (MLDUM) and \n                                                 \n6\n For a detailed discussion of the speed of adjustment model see Antoniou et al. (2006). \n7\n Four different methodologies, OLS in levels, OLS-first differences, GMM-differences and GMM-SYS, were used \nto estimate Eq. (1) and GMM-SYS was confirmed to be the most appropriate methodology.  \n13 \n \nSingapore (SPDUM), and 0 otherwise. Country dummies are subsequently replaced firstly by an \neconomic development dummy (EDEV), which takes the value of 1 for Thailand and Malaysia \nand 0 for Singapore and Australia, and secondly by the legal and governance variables identified \nin Section 3.3 above, one at a time. \nSince the role of market-wide determinants may vary depending on how severely the crisis \nhit different countries, and thus estimating across all countries may be misleading as effects may \ncancel each other out, the data for the four sample countries are subsequently divided into two \ngroups: countries least affected and countries most affected by the Asian crisis. Equation (1) is \naugmented with market-wide factors, one at a time, over the whole sample period, using GMM-\nSYS as the main estimation method. Finally, to further investigate the possible effects of the \n1997 Asian crisis, equation (1) augmented by the market-wide determinants is re-estimated with \nGMM-SYS over two sub-sample periods, the pre-crisis period between 1993 and 1996, and the \npost-crisis period between 1998 and 2001. Wald-statistics are estimated to test for any \nsignificant change in the role of the identified variables due to the financial crisis. \n \n5. Empirical Results \n5.1. Debt Maturity Dynamics: Firm-specific effects on debt maturity  \n Table 4 (Panel A) presents the findings from estimating equation (1) using GMM-SYS for \nwhole sample period. AR (1) suggests a negative first-order serial correlation, while AR (2) \nsuggests the absence of second-order serial correlation, satisfying the assumption of no higher-\norder serial correlation. All Wald statistics of joint significance of the regressors (Wald Test 1) \nare significant. The Sargan test indicates that the instruments used are valid and not correlated \nwith the error term. The coefficients of lagged debt maturity are positive. The findings are \nconsistent with Ozkan (2000) and Antoniou et al. (2006) and suggest that firms in this region \nhave a target optimal debt maturity structure. Australian firms have the highest adjustment speed \n(0.71), while Malaysian firms show a relatively slow adjustment (0.48).  \n14 \n \n Table 4 (Panel B) presents the findings by country groupings. The estimates confirm that \nfirms have target debt maturity structure during both pre- and post-crisis periods. In the pre-\ncrisis period, firms in the countries least affected by the crisis appeared to be able to adjust their \ndebt maturity structure to the target level faster (1-\u03b2 ~ 0.70) than firms in the countries most \naffected (1-\u03b2 ~ 0.40). While the crisis did not have a significant impact on the speed of \nadjustment for firms in the countries most affected by the crisis, in the countries least affected \nthe crisis substantially slowed down the speed of adjustment, suggesting that the adjustment \nprocess was relatively costly in the aftermath of the crisis. \n[Insert Table 4] \nThe results for the whole sample period (Table 4, Panel A) show that leverage8 is \npositively related to debt maturity, supporting the liquidity risk argument that higher leverage \nencourages firms to avoid short-term debt. It also implies that leverage and debt maturity are \nused as strategic complements to reduce the under-investment problem, as suggested by Barclay \net al. (2003). The coefficients of firm size are positive and significant confirming the hypothesis \nthat small firms are prone to higher agency costs of debt and thus tend to shorten their debt \nmaturity to reduce these costs. The findings also support the signalling hypothesis, which \nstipulates that small firms have higher levels of asymmetric information, and thus they are more \nmotivated to use short-term debt to signal their quality to the market. However, growth \nopportunity has no influence on the debt maturity structure of firms.9 Debt maturity may not be \nused to reduce the under-investment problem, because firms, especially in Malaysia and \nSingapore, have highly concentrated ownership and a close relationship with their banks. \n                                                 \n8\n To examine the sensitivity of the results to the definition of leverage, equation (1) was also estimated with \nleverage redefined as the ratio of total debt to total assets. The (unreported) results were statistically similar to those \ndiscussed in the paper. In addition, Barclay et al. (2003) point out that the regression coefficients can be potentially \nbiased and inconsistent when both leverage and investment opportunities are included in the regression as \nindependent variables. Thus, alternative formulations were estimated excluding leverage from the model. The \n(unreported) estimates were similar to those presented in the paper, confirming that the results are robust. \n9\n Esho et al. (2002) obtain similar results for Australian firms. Deesomsak et al. (2004) also find that growth \nopportunity has no significant effect on the capital structure decision of Malaysian and Australian firms.  \n15 \n \n Earnings volatility has a negative effect on debt maturity only in Singapore.  This is \nconsistent with the findings of other studies (Guedes and Opler, 1996) and supports the \nbankruptcy cost argument. Liquidity is positively related to debt maturity in all countries. This \nsuggests that firms in this region choose to issue more long-term debt when they are more liquid \nto avoid cash shortages and lower their probability of bankruptcy. Contrasting results between \ndeveloped and emerging countries are found for the relationship between profitability and debt \nmaturity. This relationship is positive and significant only for firms in emerging countries, \nsupporting the tax hypothesis that highly profitable firms minimize their tax liability by \nchoosing longer-term debt. Mixed results are also found for the relationship between share price \nperformance and debt maturity. A positive and significant relationship is only observed in \nAustralia, supporting the signalling hypothesis that firms whose shares are perceived to under-\nperform tend to issue shorter-term debt to signal their quality to the market, while firms whose \nshares are perceived to over-perform issue longer-term debt to exploit the market mispricing. \nMixed support is shown for the maturity-matching hypothesis, as asset maturity is positively \nrelated to debt maturity only in Singapore. \nThe findings in Table 4 (Panel B) show three distinctive effects of the crisis on the role of \nfirm-specific determinants. Firstly, the Asian crisis had different effects between country \ngroupings on the relationship between debt maturity and leverage, earnings volatility, and \nprofitability. The role of long-term debt in offsetting the higher liquidity risk and in delaying the \nexposure to bankruptcy, as proxied by leverage, reduced substantially after the crisis in the \ncountries least affected. However, the opposite pattern is found for the countries most affected \nby the crisis, due to higher financial distress and expected bankruptcy costs following the crisis. \nEarnings volatility played no role in the most affected countries in either pre- or post-crisis \nperiods, whereas it became a significant negative factor in the least affected countries after the \ncrisis. This negative relationship implies a stronger agency effect in the more developed markets \nand is consistent with findings from developed markets (Guedes and Opler, 1996). The \n16 \n \nrelationship between profitability and debt maturity in the most affected countries became \nsignificantly positive in the post-crisis period, implying that the financial crisis might have \nraised firms\u2019 awareness of tax effects, but no significant effect is found for the countries least \naffected by the crisis. Secondly, the crisis appears to have had similar effects on the relationship \nbetween debt maturity and liquidity in both country groupings, regardless of how severely they \nwere hit by the crisis. Although before the crisis liquidity played no role, after the crisis it \nbecame a significant positive factor in determining debt maturity. This implies that after the \ncrisis firms with higher levels of liquidity chose to issue longer-term debt to avoid cash \nshortages. Thirdly, the results also reveal that the financial crisis did not alter the effects of asset \nmaturity, share price performance, firm size and growth opportunity.  \nIn summary, the findings presented in Table 4 show that some determinants were more \npowerful and consistent than others in explaining the choice of debt maturity of firms operating \nin the Asia Pacific region.10 The results not only show how the crisis affected the firm\u2019s \nfinancing decision, but also show considerable variation in the importance of the determinants \nof debt maturity structure across sample countries, motivating further investigation into the \neffects of country-specific variables.  \n5.2. Country-specific effects on debt maturity  \nTo investigate country-specific effects on debt maturity, equation (2) is estimated using \npanel data that combine all firms across all sample countries over the whole sample period.11 All \ncountry dummies coefficients are highly significant, showing that country-specific factors play a \npart in the debt maturity choice of firms. To investigate this general finding further, country \ndummies are replaced with an economic development dummy and several legal and corporate \n                                                 \n10\n As a robustness test, debt maturity was also modelled as a function of k firm specific factors for each country \nusing pooled OLS. Industry dummies are included in the model to control for industry effects, but they were found \nto be statistically insignificant. Further robustness tests are conducted by using cross-sectional OLS analysis to \npreserve the dispersion across firms and eliminate the serial correlation problem in residuals that tends to inflate the \nt-statistics in pooled regressions (Rajan and Zingales, 1995). The results from pooled OLS and cross-sectional \nestimations are not qualitatively different from those presented in Table 4. \n11\n In the interest of space results are not reported in tables. \n17 \n \ngovernance factors considered in turn as discussed in Section 4.2. Economic development is \nfound to have a highly significant and negative effect, implying that firms in developing \ncountries tend to issue less long-term debt, a result that contradicts the findings of Fan et al. \n(2004). In terms of legal and corporate governance variables, as predicted and in line with Fan et \nal. (2004) and Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999), the corruption level is negatively \nassociated with debt maturity, implying a positive relationship between legal enforcement and \ndebt maturity, and supporting the monitoring function of short-term debt. Legal protection is \nalso found to be a significant factor in determining firm\u2019s debt maturity choice. In line with \nDemirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999), firms in countries with superior creditor rights use \nrelatively more short-term debt, implying that the ability of firms to use short-term debt is \nhigher when creditors are better protected, as banks have more incentives to monitor borrowers. \nOn the contrary, firms in countries with higher shareholder rights use more long-term debt since \nthe agency cost of debt is lower and thus the need to use short-term loans to mitigate agency \nproblems is reduced. Ownership concentration has a negative and significant relationship with \ndebt maturity in support of the moral hazard hypothesis. Finally, a positive relationship is found \nbetween the market share of the big-5 auditors and debt maturity, highlighting the important \nrole of auditors in facilitating the transmission of information.  \nSince the estimates show that economic development and country dummies play a \nsignificant role in explaining debt maturity patterns, this is investigated further by the inclusion \nof market-wide variables. In particular, given that the sample countries are at different stages of \neconomic development and were hit by the crisis by different degrees, some of the true market-\nwide effects could have been averaged out if estimated over the full set of countries. It is an \nimportant question whether the identified market-wide determinants had a different impact on \nthe sample countries depending upon their stage of development and vulnerability to the crisis. \nEquation (1) is augmented by market-wide factors for the pooled panels of the two country \ngroupings, least and most affected by the crisis, as defined in Section 4.1, and is estimated by \n18 \n \nusing the GMM-SYS methodology. Further tests are conducted using pooled OLS and average \ncross-sectional framework to ensure the robustness of the results. The estimates based on GMM-\nSYS are consistent with those from pooled OLS. However, the latter show higher significance \nlevels, leading to stronger contrasting effects of market-wide factors. Therefore, Table 5 \npresents the results of the pooled OLS estimations relating to firm-specific and market-wide \ndeterminants for the two country groupings identified.12  \n[Insert Table 5] \nEstimates over the whole sample period show a negative and significant coefficient of \nbank development for the least affected countries, supporting the findings of Fan et al. (2004) \nthat in developed economies banks are able to take full advantage of their monitoring power and \nact as information providers to other creditors. Thus, the larger the banking sector, the more \nfirms are encouraged to issue short-term debt. On the contrary, in less developed countries a \npositive and significant relationship shows that a larger banking sector leads to more long-term \ndebts. This is consistent with Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic\u2019s (1999) argument that in \ndeveloping countries with weaker legal systems, a larger banking sector is associated with \nlonger maturity debts, as creditor\u2019s rights are strengthen by the size of the banking sector. In \naddition, the closer relationship between firms and their banks in developing countries and the \nlack of an efficient equity market may also encourage banks to grant relatively more long-term \ndebts. \nThe findings further reveal an opposite pattern in the relationships between stock market \ndevelopment and the term structure of interest rates and debt maturity between the two groups \nof countries. In the countries least affected by the crisis, where stock markets are relatively more \ndeveloped and firms can more easily raise equity finance, firms are found to hold relatively \n                                                 \n12\n The results based on the GMM-SYS estimation are not reported in tables. Previous studies have also found that \nthe results may vary depending on the methodology applied. For example, Antoniou et al. (2006) find mixed effects \nof the term structure of interest rates on debt maturity, while Barclay and Smith (1995) find a negative and \nsignificant relationship when panel data are used in pooled OLS and fixed effects, but an insignificant relationship \nwhen cross-sectional data are used.  \n19 \n \nshorter maturity debt. The reverse is true for firms in the most affected countries, where stock \nmarkets are less developed. Consistent with the tax hypothesis, firms in countries most affected \nby the crisis employ more long-term debt when the term structure of interest rates has a positive \nslope. On the other hand, the market timing hypothesis dominates the effect in the least affected \ncountries, in line with Guedes and Opler (1996). This latter finding shows some evidence of less \nthan fully rational behaviour of managers (optimism) as discussed in Baker et al. (2007), namely \nthat managers time their debt maturity choice by issuing short-term debt when the term spread is \nhigh, as they expect long-term rates to decline. Finally, consistent with the findings of \nDemirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999), high inflation is negatively related to the use of long-\nterm debt in the countries most affected by the crisis.  \nIn relation to the effects of the financial crisis, market-wide factors appears to be generally \nhighly significant in both country groupings in the pre- and post-crisis periods, and the direction \nof the effects is in line with the findings for the whole sample period. Thus, overall the crisis did \nnot alter the contrasting effects of market-wide determinants observed earlier.  However, it \nsignificantly changed the size of their impact, especially in the less developed countries. The \ncoefficient of inflation is the only one that changes sign after the crisis and becomes positive for \nboth country groupings. This may explain why inflation appeared insignificant in the previous \naggregate analysis of the whole sample period. Over the pre-crisis period higher inflation \nappears to have been associated with reduced long-term debt to minimise the interest rate risk, \nconsistent with Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1999). \nIn summary, the results confirm that market-wide variables are as important as firm-\nspecific characteristics in determining debt maturity structure. These market-wide determinants \nnot only influence the maturity of firm\u2019s borrowing, but they also appear to have different \neffects depending on the country\u2019s economic development.  \n \n20 \n \n6.  Conclusions \nThe paper investigates the effects of firm-specific as well as country-specific factors, such \nas economic conditions, corporate governance and institutional set-up, on the debt maturity \nstructure of firms. It also provides the first evidence on the effects of the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis on the determinants of corporate debt maturity choice of firms operating in the region. \nSeveral conclusions emerge. Firstly, firms appear to have a target debt maturity structure. The \nspeed of adjustment is substantially reduced during the post-crisis period in the countries least \naffected by the crisis, suggesting that the costs of moving towards the target increased with the \ncrisis. Secondly, the debt maturity structure of sample firms is strongly related to a number of \nfirm-specific and market-wide factors, as well as the country\u2019s corporate governance, and the \nlegal and institutional environments. These findings are consistent with a number of previous \nempirical studies, and offer further evidence for the Asia Pacific region. Thirdly, the evidence \nsupports the view that the debt maturity structure decision can affect the cost of external finance \nand plays an important role in alleviating some capital market imperfections.  \nFourthly, the results show that the debt maturity structure decision can also help to \nalleviate the shortcomings of the legal and corporate governance systems. Market-wide factors \nfurther appear to influence debt maturity, and this effect depends on the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. Fifthly, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 appears to have had several significant \neffects on both firm-specific and market-wide determinants of debt maturity structure, especially \nin Thailand and Malaysia where the crisis originated. However, effects were observed even in \nthe countries least affected by the crisis. More specifically, the relationship between debt \nmaturity structure and many of its determinants changed significantly after the crisis, both in \nsize and\/or direction. Finally, the crisis forced managers to recognise the importance of an \nappropriate debt maturity structure for their firms, in terms of both reducing funding costs and \nliquidity constraints, and improving the information flow to outside investors and thus agency \nproblems. \n21 \n \n \nReferences \nAntoniou, A., Guney, Y., Paudyal, K., 2006.
