INTRODUCTION\nIt is more than half a century since Max Mathews\nbegan his first tentative experiments in digital sound\nsynthesis at Bell Telephone Laboratories, New Jersey.\nThe technology employed has long since passed into\nobscurity, and only a select and inevitably diminishing\ngroup of pioneers is now able to provide a conduit to\nthis bygone era. The formative era of electroacoustic\nmusic during the 1940s and 1950s fares little better.\nAlthough some of the devices employed still exist in\nworking order, very few students studying the medium\nsince the early 1990s are likely to have encountered\nthe delights and frustrations of the tape recorder and\nrazor blade, let alone the myriad of other devices which\npredate the first generation of voltage-controlled\nsynthesizers, in turn now very much a rarity.\nThe situation regarding access to the musical\nrepertory is just as problematic. A few works dating\nfrom these early years have been reissued as CDs, but\nthe majority of commercial pressings remain as vinyl\nrecordings, long since deleted from record catalogues.\nThe situation as regards access to the original master\ntapes is if anything worse. Many of these have\ndisappeared over the years as studios have closed and\nthose that survive are often in a poor physical state\nas a result of the passage of time. The efforts of\norganisations such as the Electronic Music Founda-\ntion (New York) to preserve and make accessible this\nimportant musical legacy for posterity are strongly to\nbe encouraged, and it is not too late to make further\nprogress in this regard. The remaining window of\nopportunity, however, is finite.\nOne unfortunate tendency of previous lines of\nenquiry, and more particularly the ways in which the\nfindings have been subsequently interpreted by teach-\ners and practitioners, is that judgements relating to\nthe relevance or otherwise of this pioneering era have\noften been based upon incomplete criteria. Much has\nbeen written on the history of the repertory and the\ntheoretical considerations which informed the devel-\nopment of an associated aesthetic. Considerable atten-\ntion has also been paid to the technological principles\nthat shape and determine the practical processes of\nsound production and transformation. What is often\nneglected, however, is the true nature of these early\ntechnologies, in particular the ways in which their\nfunctional characteristics shaped and influenced the\ncreativity of composers.\n2. ART AND PRACTICE: THE ROLE OF\nTECHN\u00c9 AND A STRATEGY FOR FURTHER\nSTUDY\nThe seeds for what has become an increasing disjunc-\ntion were sown long ago. Gianmario Borio, writing in\n1993 on the aesthetics of electronic music in the 1950s,\nconcluded that:\nThe appearance of electronic music at the beginning\nof the 1950s had presented a challenge for musicology.\nIt focused on the need for a new evaluation of the role\nplayed by techniques and technologies in the creative\nprocess, and this implicated a revision of some aesthetic\nprinciples. . . . The question whether a specific approach\non the aesthetics of electronic music is desirable or even\nnecessary, seems to have received a negative answer by\nthe attitude of composers themselves after 1960. (Borio\n1993: 85)\n82 Peter Manning\nAlthough his conclusion is perhaps a little overstated,\nthe underlying argument is nonetheless significant,\nsince it draws attention to the considerable aesthetic\nchallenges posed by a medium where notation, at\nleast in the conventional sense, is replaced at best\nby functional descriptions of the technical procedures\nemployed in realising a work, and at worst just the\nacoustic results. \u2018One wonders, how much specialised\nknowledge is required in order to reconstruct the\nstructural level, even if only a general form\u2019 (ibid.: 81).\nThe importance and value of quantifying and reflect-\ning upon both the theoretical and practical compo-\nnents of the compositional process as a means of\nadvancing aesthetic debate led to spirited arguments\nduring the formative years, involving not only elec-\ntroacoustic composers but also members of the wider\nartistic community.\nNotwithstanding this highly proactive level of\nengagement, the significance of studying the nature\nof the interactions between electroacoustic composers\nand the tools of analysis and re-synthesis at their\ndisposal was not universally recognised. As the years\nadvanced and the technologies gained in both versatil-\nity and in sophistication, so these issues were increas-\ningly side-stepped. Some influential commentators,\nhowever, became concerned with what they perceived\nas impediments to creative progress and accordingly\nrekindled the debate. Writing in 1977, Pierre Boulez\nobserved that:\nRather than ask themselves the double question, both\nfunctional and fundamental, whether the material is\nadequate to the idea and the idea compatible with the\nmaterial, [musicians] give way to the dangerous tempta-\ntion of a superficial simple question: does the material\nsatisfy my immediate needs? Such a hasty choice,\ndetached from all but the most service functions,\ncertainly cannot lead far, for it excludes all genuine dia-\nlectic and assumes that invention can divorce itself from\nthe material, that intellectual schemas can exist without\nthe support of sound. . . . [Invention] should not be satis-\nfied with a raw material come upon by chance, even if\nit can profit from such accidents and, in exceptional\ncircumstances enlarge upon them. (Boulez 1977: 9\u201311)\nThese observations reflect a particular point of view,\nand it is illuminating to probe some way beneath\nthe surface. In effect, the article amounts to a mission\nstatement for IRCAM, specifically the concern of the\nauthor to place the technology of the computer centre-\nstage in the quest for \u2018a common language which\nwould take account of the imperatives of musical\ninvention and the priorities of technology\u2019 (ibid.: 12).\nBoulez argued strongly for a fully integrated environ-\nment, considering it \u2018absolutely necessary . . . that we\nshould move towards global, generalisable solutions\u2019\n(ibid.: 14).\nSuch a perspective was to become central to the\nwork of IRCAM. It is important, however, to bear in\nmind that Boulez enjoyed the luxury of an environ-\nment where a fruitful symbiosis between artistic aspi-\nration and the construction of the technical means\nnecessary to realise such ambitions was a practical\nproposition. This creative empowerment fostered a\nculture within the institution that all but ignored\nwhat had gone before. In thus choosing to ignore the\nachievements of others working in less favourable\ncircumstances, faced with circumventing the practical\nlimitations of whatever technologies were at their dis-\nposal, an important opportunity was lost. A key pur-\npose of this article is to establish if there are valuable\nlessons to be learnt from these experiences, not least\nin terms of informing future directions, both technical\nand musical.\nThis vision of IRCAM\u2019s mission provides a defining\npoint of reference for the central focus of this critique.\nAs Tod Machover observed in 1984, a key concern\nof this institution was to provide \u2018a common meeting\nground not only for scientists and musicians . . . but\none for composers and their colleagues\u2019 (Machover\n1984: 1). This led him to reflect whether \u2018a typical\nmusical bent, an \u201cIRCAM style\u201d had begun to emerge\nfrom the studios\u2019. In conjecturing that \u2018this has not\nbeen the case, and that musical diversity is, in fact,\nmuch more common at IRCAM than standardi-\nsation\u2019, he suggests that \u2018the diversity is due also to the\nneutrality of technology, which offers powerful tools\nfor exploration and creation but does not orient the\ncomposer in any particular musical direction\u2019 (ibid.:\n1\u20132).\nThis proposition is open to challenge. Carlos\nPalombini, in a critique published in 1998, undermines\nMachover\u2019s advocacy of neutrality as a universal\npanacea for success, citing the following observation\nfrom Heidegger: \u2018We are delivered over to technology\nin the worst possible way when we regard it as some-\nthing neutral: for this conception of it makes us utterly\nblind to the essence of technology\u2019 (Palombini 1998:\n35).\nHeidegger\u2019s arguments were articulated in 1954,\nright at the height of the early debates about the\naesthetic justification for electroacoustic music as a\ncreative medium and long before the technical sophis-\ntication of IRCAM and the implications thereof could\nhave been envisaged. His recall of the Greek concept\nof techn\u00e9, and how it became synonymous with the\nprocesses of creative development and dissemination,\nacted as a catalyst for others. Adorno, for example,\nwriting just four years later observes that:\nThe meaning of the Greek word techn\u00e9 from which both\n\u2018technique\u2019 and \u2018technology\u2019 are derived offers an indica-\ntion of the unity of this concept with art. If art is the\nexternal representation of something internal, the con-\ncept of technique embraces everything which pertains to\nthe realisation of that interior substance. In the case\nof music, not only the realisation of spiritual substance\nThe significance of techn\u00e9 83\nin the score is involved, but the transformation which\nmakes this score accessible to sensory perception as well.\nIn short, both production and reproduction are involved.\nMusical technique embraces the totality of all musical\nmeans: the organisation of the substance itself and its\ntransformation into a physical phenomenon. (Adorno\n1958: 11)\nIf this alternative proposition has currency, it follows\nthat the functional characteristics of technology will\nalmost invariably influence the creative process, and\ntherefore cannot be ignored in any evaluation of the\nresulting aesthetic.1\nAgostino Di Scipio has succinctly identified the\nfundamental dilemma which continually confronts\nelectroacoustic composers:\nHow can I use the available existing task-environment to\nrealise my own ideas of composition?\nor\nHow can I design the tools that are necessary to realise\nmy own idea of composition? (Di Scipio 1995a: 37)\nIt has been the tendency to favour the former appro-\nach rather than the latter which underpins the criti-\ncisms of Boulez highlighted above. Although such\nobservations were by no means new, Di Scipio\u2019s\nfurther consideration of these issues viewed from\nthe perspective of an ethnomusicologist sheds useful\nadditional light on their significance, most notably the\nneed to \u2018grasp something of the composer\u2019s concep-\ntion of sound materials and the cognitive relation\nbetween sound materials and musical form\u2019 (ibid.).\nIn a subsequent article, considering specifically the\ncentrality of techn\u00e9 for an aesthetic approach to elec-\ntroacoustic music, he develops this hypothesis further:\nIn electroacoustic music the making of a work is, to some\nextent, captured and documented in the technical tools\nadopted or specially designed by the composer. The\ncomposer\u2019s relationship to the materials and the forms of\nhis\/her art (which to me is the very object of any analytic\nview) are mediated by those design tools \u2013 tools of work\nand thought. They cannot be considered foreign to an\naesthetic approach, for they do reflect the artist\u2019s knowl-\nedge and his\/her conception of sound and music, and to\nsome extent could be studied. The technological tools\nembody the theory of music behind a composer\u2019s attitude\nand work (knowledge of the field), and objectify the\ncognitive strategies involved in using the theory (action\nknowledge). (Di Scipio 1995b: 374)\nThere are alternative, but not necessarily incom-\npatible views on the nature and importance of the\ninteractions that occur between electroacoustic com-\nposers and their tools. For example, Leigh Landy has\nobserved that:\nAs technology seems to be at the heart (it does represent\nat least a limb) of electroacoustic music, it comes as no\nsurprise that its history is often presented within a tech-\nnology or theory-based wrapper. Yet, as said, the history\nof this music (and its prehistory) is not solely technology\nbased or even necessarily technology driven. (Landy\n1999: 64)\nLandy\u2019s concerns are not so much to do with the fact\nthat creativity and technology become inextricably\nlinked in the realisation of electroacoustic works, but\nthe manner in which such considerations have been\nevaluated in musicological discourse: \u2018Does it suffice\nto illustrate theory or studio equipment or do we\nneed to know more about how the music has been\nconstructed?\u2019(ibid.: 63). It is the latter issue that is to be\nconsidered here. To paraphrase Landy, explaining the\nnuts and bolts of how an electroacoustic work has\nbeen constructed is only the starting point. Under-\nstanding the techn\u00e9 that shapes and influences how\nsuch processes are selected and applied is the much\nbigger and more valuable goal. \u2018Rewinding the tape,\nare we overemphasising a little the relevance of the\nexciting 1948\u201350s period half a century later?\u2019 (ibid.:\n63). We shall see.\nThe challenges to be faced in addressing such issues\nare significant, no more so than in the consideration\nof an era of creative engagement so far removed from\npresent day experiences. The current context only per-\nmits an exploratory investigation, and it is therefore\nimportant that the arguments for conducting more\nrigorous and extensive research are put forward within\na clearly defined context. In necessarily selecting a\nspecific area of technology for this purpose, there is\na risk that the focus will be too narrow and therefore\nnot sufficiently representative for more wide-ranging\nconclusions to be drawn. In choosing key aspects\nof the technology associated with the tape recorder\nfor special study, however, the chances of such an\nunsatisfactory outcome are significantly reduced.\n3. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUND IMAGING\nAND SPATIAL PROJECTION TECHNIQUES\nFor more than thirty-five years, circa 1950\u20131985,\nthe reel-to-reel tape recorder provided the primary\ntool for registering and manipulating electroacoustic\nmaterials. Its functional characteristics and practical\nlimitations thus determined the modus operandi for\nthe overwhelming majority of composers during the\nformative post-Second World War years. Whereas\nrecorded magnetic tape reveals no visual clues as to the\nnature of the recorded material, a precise and easily\nidentifiable relationship between the duration of a\nsound extract and the physical length of tape required\n1Put another way, Techn\u00e9, to paraphrase Heidegger (1954: 13), is\nconcerned with the revealing or bringing-forth of creative ideas\nthrough technology, rather than the means by which they are\ncreated. Palombini\u2019s succinct analysis of Heidegger\u2019s Ge-stell in\nhis article, and its relevance to the study of techn\u00e9, provides useful\nbackground reading for many of the ideas that will be pursued in\nthe current context.\n84 Peter Manning\nto register the information establishes a very special\nworking environment. The freedom to start and stop\nrecorders at will, while at the same time dynamically\nregulating the amplitude levels of these reproduced\nmaterials, cultivated an art of performance in the\nrealisation of works which is very remote from any\nof the practices normally encountered in the highly\nintegrated world of the digital computer studio.\nOne important consideration is the nature of\nthe recording facilities available to electroacoustic\ncomposers during the pioneering years. Up until the\nmid-1950s, conventional studios were designed for\nmono recording only. Although prototype stereo tape\nrecorders became available during the first part of the\ndecade, it was not until the advent of the stereo long-\nplaying record circa 1958 that commercial production\nbegan in earnest. As a consequence, a significant pro-\nportion of the early repertory was produced using\nmono recorders. This had major implications, both\nin terms of the techniques that were used to build up\ncomposite sounds from individual components, and\nalso the very special challenges that had to be over-\ncome in creating works that use two or more playback\nchannels.\nThe first concert performance of Symphonie pour un\nhomme seule by Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry in\nthe \u00c9cole Normale de Musique, Paris, on 18 March\n1950 is a case in point. This event brought the creation\nand spatial dissemination of electroacoustic music into\nthe concert hall in a highly dramatic fashion, the audi-\nence witnessing the synthesis of the work both aurally\nand visually, the operators being required to run about\nthe stage area starting and stopping the contributing\nrecordings, reproduced via a spatially distributed net-\nwork of monophonic playback systems, each assigned\nto a different amplifier and loudspeaker. Important\naspects of the techn\u00e9 associated with the synthesis\nand spatialisation of this work thus became a shared\nexperience.2\nAcross the Atlantic, similar techniques were being\npursued by composers associated with John Cage\u2019s\nearly project, Music for Magnetic Tape. Their works\nwere written for either four or eight independent\nsound channels, to be reproduced simultaneously via\nan array of mono tape recorders and amplifiers, the\nassociated loudspeakers being spatially distributed\naround the listening area, typically in a circular\nformat. Notable examples include Cage\u2019s Williams\nMix, completed in 1952, and Octet 1 for Eight Loud-\nspeakers, composed by Earle Brown in 1953. Without\nany physical means of achieving and maintaining\naccurate synchronisation between the tape recorders,\neach performance becomes a unique and unrepeatable\nexperience. Indeed the inevitable differences which\nresult from one performance to another were consid-\nered by the composers to be an essential ingredient\nof the underlying aesthetic. The tape recorders, in\nessence, become contributing members of a perform-\ning ensemble.\nThe techniques of sound imaging explored by\ncomposers at the Studio di Fonologia Musicale,\nMilan provide another illustration of compositional\npractices which have long since been forgotten. This\nstudio, directed by Luciano Berio from its foundation\nin 1955 until 1961, was by far the most generously\nequipped European studio of its time, both in terms of\naudio synthesis and signal processing devices and also\nthe provision of stereo capabilities from the outset.\nPrior to the introduction of a four-track tape recorder\nin 1959, first used for compositions such as Momenti\n(1960) by Berio, and Omaggio a Emilio Vedova (1960)\nby Luigi Nono, works were produced using a hybrid\nrecording environment consisting of a bank of six\nmono recorders and two stereo recorders.\nWhat is notable here is the very precise and aurally\neffective use of sound imaging explored by the early\nMilan composers in their two-channel works. Indeed,\nthe use of the more familiar descriptor \u2018stereo\u2019 is some-\nwhat inappropriate since the image space was usually\npartitioned into either two fixed loci (mono left \u2013\nleft-hand speaker only, and mono right \u2013 right-hand\nspeaker only), or three fixed loci (mono left, mono\nright, plus a mono signal projected to both speakers\nwith equal volume, resulting in a dead centre image).\nRather than adopt the essentially asynchronous\napproach used by Cage and his associates, the major-\nity of the early Milan composers micromanaged the\nspatial interactions between the contributing sound\nstreams as an integral part of the creative process,\ncreating a continuum between sharply differentiated\nmaterial and what essentially were quasi-stereo effects\nwhere sound images mapped to one of the loci are\nghosted, using subtly manipulated time delays, to\nanother locus.\nThe distinctive approach to sound imaging raises\nan important question. Was it the case that the\nmanipulation of monophonic sound sources in the\nmanner described was driven by the compositional\naesthetic, or was it the technology itself that drove\nthe creative process? The pragmatic answer is that we\ncannot be entirely sure. No detailed records of how the\nworks were actually constructed have survived, and\nfrom this distance in time, recollections are at best\nanecdotal and thus of limited reliability. There are,\nhowever, some technical documents (see, for example,\nLietti 1956) that can at least offer some useful clues.\nOne factor is the role played by the technical assis-\ntants, for there is strong evidence to suggest that they\nplayed a key role as mediators between composers and\n2It should be noted that this work involved the performance of disk\nphonograph recordings, since the studio had yet to acquire any tape\nrecorders. In terms of the techn\u00e9, however, in particular the physical\nengagement with the start and stop controls of the recorders, the\nsignificance of this consideration is only marginal.\nThe significance of techn\u00e9 85\nthe practical techniques used to realise their ideas.3\nThe implications of this are potentially far reaching,\nfor there is every reason to suppose that their role was\nanything but neutral. To electroacoustic composers,\nnot least those associated with this pioneering era, the\nnotion that their works might have been shaped\ncreatively not merely by the technology available but\nalso those who assisted them is very hard to accept.\nIt is indeed very striking how few, when recollecting\ntheir studio experiences, even acknowledge that their\ntechnical assistants played any part whatsoever in the\ncreative process.\nThe functional characteristics of the technology\nitself are of particular relevance here. For example,\nin considering the ways in which tape recorders were\nused at this time to assemble electroacoustic composi-\ntions, one significant factor is the operational design\nof the studio mixer. In the case of mixers manufac-\ntured since the early 1970s, it is usually the case that\nincoming audio signals can be mapped to any point\nwithin a stereo image by using a simple rotary control,\nregulating the relative distribution of the signal levels\nbetween the associated pair of loudspeakers. Back\nin the 1950s, such facilities were rare, often requiring\nan invariably cumbersome and often unsatisfactory\nworkaround. One consequence of this situation was a\ntendency, especially in the formative stages of compo-\nsition, to bypass the mixer altogether and simply con-\nnect the tape recorders directly to individual speakers\nin the studio. Thus the very processes of selecting and\nshaping materials for a composite sound led to modes\nof listening and critical evaluation that involved the\nuse of multiple point source sound projection.\nIn terms of conducting aural analyses of these\nworks, archival research elicits a useful if at times\nhard-to-find legacy of commercial recordings. Some\ncaution, however, has to be exercised in drawing any\ndefinitive conclusions on the uses of spatial projection\nfrom aural analyses of these recordings, since there\nis a strong probability of often subtle but nonetheless\npotentially significant discrepancies between the origi-\nnal studio master tapes and what was actually released\nin the public domain. Berio\u2019s Thema \u2013 Omaggio a\nJoyce (1958) is a notable illustration of this. For\nreasons almost entirely attributable to the associated\ntechnology, none of the commercial pressings of this\nwork achieves the clarity of image separation present\nin the original stereo master tape. Whereas the degree\nof \u2018cross talk\u2019 or leakage of sound information\nbetween the two adjacent tracks of a stereo magnetic\ntape recording is relatively small, this is patently\nnot the case when this information is transferred to a\nstereo record groove. In the latter case, the nature of\nthe recording medium reduces the maximum degree\nof channel separation to such an extent that the true\nisolation of a sound in either channel cannot be\nachieved.4\nA further limitation arises from the tracking diffi-\nculties encountered in any situation where a sudden\nburst of sound information in one channel is not modi-\nfied by suitably compensating activity in the other. In\nsuch a situation the resulting asymmetry in the profile\nof the groove walls can cause the stylus to jump out of\nthe groove. To reduce this possibility, record manufac-\nturers would invariably limit the maximum possible\ndegree of channel separation by deliberately introduc-\ning an element of cross channel blending, reducing\nstill further the possibility of reproducing the original\nperspective. The reduced degree of spatial differentia-\ntion encountered in the commercial recordings of\nworks such as Thema thus compromises the original\nintentions.\nThe extent to which spatial projection became so\ncentral a consideration for the Milan composers\ncan be further corroborated by studying contempo-\nrary commentaries by those who had occasion to\nwork there. One of the most revealing is a detailed\naccount by Marc Wilkinson of his experiences over a\ntwo-month period in 1957. This contains the following\nobservations:\nThe listener can [perform] the act of hearing. In good\nconditions, surrounded by a stereophony of sound\nprojectors, his mind will automatically concentrate on\ndifferent sets of projectors in turn. Each \u2018performance\u2019 of\nthe work will bring new visions, for the mind will almost\ncertainly rearrange the sequence of its concentration\nin space; for that matter, the listener can \u2018interpret\u2019 the\nmusic by moving about within the confines of the\nstereophony during performance, thereby consciously\ncreating states of imbalance between the component\nconstructions in sounds simultaneously projected from\nthe different spatial origins. (Wilkinson 1958: 48)\nHere the thinking logically extends the aesthetics\nof sound projection a stage further, and in so doing\nencapsulates a yet wider range of compositional prac-\ntices, including those already explored in the context\nof the \u2018Music for Magnetic Tape\u2019 project. Cage indeed\nsubsequently visited the studio in 1958 to compose\nFontana Mix, based on a kaleidoscope of sound frag-\nments from diverse sources recorded onto four mono\ntapes, played back simultaneously via four playback\nsystems with independent loudspeakers.\nThe development of commercial four-track record-\ners facilitated a change in composing practices at\nMilan from 1959 onwards since it was at last possible\n3The prominent contributions of the chief technician, Marino\nZuccheri, are noted by Chadabe (Chadabe 1997: 57\u201362). See also\nWilkinson (1958) for a contemporary and at times revealing\naccount of the working environment.\n4The maximum channel separation possible in a stereo groove at\n1 kHz is about 35 dB. The performance of most pickup cartridges\nreduces this to about 25 dB.\n86 Peter Manning\nto work synchronously with a truly stable multi-\nchannel sound environment. The distinctive character-\nistics of point source imaging, however, were by no\nmeans abandoned, many composers taking advantage\nof the new facilities to refine these techniques still fur-\nther. Two of the other major European studios active\nat this time had acquired experimental multi-track\nrecorders some years before. In both cases, however,\nissues of unreliability were to restrict their practical\nuse.\nAn experimental three-channel tape recorder had\nbeen developed in 1951 as part of an upgrade for\nPierre Schaeffer\u2019s Club d\u2019Essai studio for musique\nconcr\u00e8te in Paris. This device consisted of a specially\nconstructed tape deck using three reels of tape, fed as\nthree parallel strips through a single three-layer trans-\nport mechanism, with one set of erase\/record\/replay\nmono tape heads for each track (Moles 1960: 77).\nWhereas the common drive capstan ensured a reason-\nable degree of synchronisation, absolute precision,\nhowever, was not possible, and the tape mechanism\nproved cumbersome and less than reliable. This latter\nconsideration generally restricted its use to intermedi-\nate processes of composition, for example, layering\nup to three components of a composite sound prior\nto mixing them together permanently as a mono\nrecording. It is a matter of some curiosity, nonetheless,\nthat none of the works completed at the studio were\nmastered via this recorder in a multi-channel format\n(Davies 1968: 69\u201372).\nThe Cologne studio went one stage further with\nthe purchase of a pioneering four-track tape recorder\nin 1953 (Enkel 1954: 10\u201311). This unique machine,\nmanufactured by Albrecht, consisted of two side-by-\nside two-track tape transports, using specially manu-\nfactured magnetic tape with perforations along one\nedge which engaged with linked sprockets. The\noriginal design of the studio linked this recorder\nto a discrete three-channel playback system in the\nmain transmission studio, using eighteen loudspeakers\norganised into three groups, one group located at the\nfront of the main listening area, and the other two\nalong the side walls (ibid.: 11\u201312).\nIt would appear, however, that this facility aroused\nlittle or no interest amongst the composing commu-\nnity, with no record of any work ever being composed\nusing this playback format (Davies 1968: 49\u201350). As\nin the case of the Paris studio, however, this special\nrecorder proved especially useful for building up\nsound textures consisting of up to four different\nelements, to be subsequently mixed down to a single\nmono track. It was Stockhausen\u2019s Gesang der\nJ\u00fcnglinge (1955\u20131956) that finally broke the mould,\nboth in terms of escaping from the extreme musical\nformalism advocated by Herbert Eimert, the studio\ndirector, and also in exploring the possibilities of\nusing a fully synchronised four-channel format for the\nspatial projection and manipulation of sounds as an\nintegral component of the compositional process.\nAlthough the form and structure of this work\nhave been written upon extensively by a number of\ncommentators (see, for example, Maconie 1990 and\nHarvey 1976), significantly less attention has been\npaid to the technical procedures he employed and\ntheir significance for the compositional process. Such\nresearch is especially challenging since no complete\nrealisation score was ever produced, and for many\nyears only some of the sketches were available for fur-\nther study. The publication of a full facsimile of these\nby Stockhausen Verlag in 2001, however, has created\nnew opportunities for gaining a greater insight into the\ncreative and technical procedures used to realise this\nwork.\nImportant groundwork for such a line of enquiry\nwas prepared by Pacal Decroupet and Elena Unge-\nheuer in 1998 (Decroupet and Engeheuer 1998). In an\ninitial consideration of the compositional issues that\nare addressed in this work, they highlight the all-\nimportant seeds of transition from essentially deter-\nministic and static timbres towards the fluidity of\nexpressive techniques that explore \u2018the overall direc-\ntional tendencies of movement: the change from one\nstate to another, with or without returning motion,\nas opposed to a fixed state . . . deriving the shapes\nof articulation for sound complexes in time from the\narticulation of a sound, in phases of attack, sustain\nand decay\u2019 (Decroupet et al. 1998: 98\u20139). These direc-\ntional tendencies of movement concern not only the\nshaping of timbres but also their spatial manipulation\nwithin the listening area.5\nIn their analysis of the compositional process,\nDecroupet and Ungeheuer succinctly identify the cre-\native dynamic which results from using serial proce-\ndures in a highly regulated form, for example to carve\nblocks of rhythmic spectra and to group formants\nin combination with statistically inspired procedures\nin order to regulate the evolution of timbre. They\nalso recognise the significance of spatial articulation,\nidentifying some of the key processes that emerged\nfrom Stockhausen\u2019s art of composition in this context,\nnoting, for example, his use of both focused and dis-\ntributed sound images to establish a continuum in\nterms of degrees of intelligibility, exploring the highly\ncontrollable characteristics of the so-called \u2018cocktail\nparty effect\u2019, where the brain can more easily analyse\nsound complexes where individual components arrive\nat the ear from different directions, rather than as\na merged image from just one direction. This charac-\nteristic, to return to an earlier discussion, is the very\nessence of the technique of distributed point source\nsound projection:\n5The work was originally conceived in a five-channel format, the\nfifth channel to be provided by an additional mono recorder\nconnected to a speaker in the ceiling. See Tannenbaum (1987: 23\u20134).\nThe significance of techn\u00e9 87\nThe electronic and vocal parts . . . have a common\ndenominator: each layer being heard in one loudspeaker,\nthe distinction of the components of the polyphony is, if\nnot easy, at least possible. On the other hand, the choral\nand impulse swarms packed together in compact blocks\nassigned to only one point in the hall . . . make impossible\nany attempt to distinguish the components. . . . Where\nthe grouping of intensity . . . would normally bring about\na complete and utter explosion, it is the spatialisation\nwhich intervenes to clarify the composition of timbres by\nallotting to certain loudspeakers all the variants of one\ncategory of timbre and by concentrating the irregular\nchanges in only one loudspeaker. (ibid.: 128)\nHaving unlocked this door to a deeper understanding\nof the true creative significance of the spatialisation\ntechniques employed here, Decroupet and Ungeheuer\ntantalisingly fail to enter. Crucial considerations are\nbypassed, for example how were the sound materials\nactually mapped to the loudspeakers, and to what\nextent did the operational characteristics of the studio,\nnot least in terms of the very basic facilities available\nfor audio mixing and channel routing, influence and\nultimately constrain the compositional process? From\neven a preliminary study of these considerations it is\nclear that this is fertile ground for further research.\nWhereas Gesang der J\u00fcnglinge proved to be a land-\nmark work in terms of the use of fully synchronised\nmulti-channel sound projection, it was Stockhausen\u2019s\nKontakte (1959\u20131960), for four-channel tape, piano\nand percussion, that demonstrated the true potential\nof combining fixed point, multi-channel sound projec-\ntion techniques with the spatial movement of sounds.\nFor all the sophistication of modern multi-channel\nsoftware tools for manipulating the location of sound\nimages, for example IRCAM\u2019s Spatialisateur or\nSPAT (Manning 2004: 398\u20139), the aurally distinctive\ncharacteristics of dynamic sound projection via Stock\nhausen\u2019s specially designed Rotationslautsprecher are\nall the more dramatic precisely because of his continu-\ning reliance on monophonic rather than stereophonic\nsounds.\nThe Rotationslautsprecher allowed sound images to\nbe rotated in either direction within a two-dimensional\nacoustic space marked out by four loudspeakers at the\ncorners of the listening area, by the simple expedient\nof manipulating a single loudspeaker on a rotating\ntable, positioned within a quadrant of microphones\n(Chadabe 1997: 41). By this time, the studio had\npurchased a four-track Telefunken tape recorder\n(Tannenbaum 1987: 21), thus at last securing a reliable\nenvironment for working with multiple channels. The\ncompositional process, however, was still essentially\nincremental, building up the composite sound field\nchannel by channel, using the mono tape recorders to\nassemble the component materials. Although a sense\nof both breadth and depth is given by the judicious and\nselective use of stereo enhancement via an EMT plate\nreverberation unit, the primary foreground imaging\nis once again achieved by spatially mapping clearly\ndifferentiated monophonic sources.\nThe exceptional clarity of this information, not\nleast in terms of the proactive engagement with the\nbrain\u2019s ability to discriminate and assimilate highly\ndirectional information from different points of the\ncompass, heightens the impact of the rotational\nimages superimposed via the Rotationslautsprecher.\nThese also have distinctive characteristics directly\nattributable to the design and practical operation of\nthis device. The sense of movement is heightened by\nthe Doppler effect that is generated as the sound from\nthe loudspeaker moves through space from one micro-\nphone to the next in the quadrant. In addition, the use\nof a special projection cone fitted to the front of the\nloudspeaker to concentrate the location of soundfield\nadds another dimension to the process. Instead of gen-\nerating a sense of smooth rotation, the resulting sound\nimages vary in their concentration, becoming closely\nfocused when directly coincident with a microphone\nand most diffuse at the mid-point between any two\nmicrophones. Thus a key characteristic of point source\nsound projection is partially retained as successive\nloudspeakers produce concentrated bursts of sound.\nWhereas many of the functional characteristics of\nthis device can be simulated using modern computer\ntechnology, there is one important respect in which the\nlatter cannot accurately reproduce an important ingre-\ndient of the associated techn\u00e9. The Rotationslautspre-\ncher was a physical performance tool, operated\ndirectly by the hand actions of the composer, rotating\nthe table faster or slower, and subject in addition to\nthe frictional forces and the inherent inertia of the\nloudspeaker table itself.\nThe significance of this device in the composition\nof Kontakte and its method of construction focuses\nattention again on the conundrum identified by Di\nScipio in terms of whether a composer uses the avail-\nable task-environment to realise compositional ideas\nand thus inevitably faces some element of compro-\nmise, or instead seeks new tools designed specifically\nfor the purpose (Di Scipio 1995a: 37). It would seem\nevident in this case that the Rotationslautsprecher was\nthe product of the latter approach, but this still leaves\nthe question, why this particular design?\nOther design principles for dynamically manipulat-\ning sound images between distributed loudspeakers\nhad already been explored elsewhere, notably the\npotentiom\u00e8tre d\u2019espace, developed in 1951 by Jacques\nPoullin for Pierre Schaeffer in Paris (Poullin 1953).\nThis consisted of a small hand-held transmitting coil\nand four wire receiving loops arranged around the\nperformer in a tetrahedron, representing in miniature\nthe location of the loudspeakers in the auditorium.\nMoving the coil about within the tetrahedron modu-\nlated the induction signals in the receiving loops, this\ninformation being applied to the electronic amplitude\n88 Peter Manning\ncontrols regulating the distribution of the sound\nsource between the loudspeakers.6\nThe engineers at Cologne were well aware of\nalternative technologies. Indeed they had already\ndeveloped an automated system for the spatial\nmanipulation of signals fed to the loudspeakers of the\noriginal three-channel studio playback system, using\nfrequency controlled switches which responded to\ntones recorded on the fourth track of the Albrecht\nrecorder (Enkel 1954: 11\u201312). The design and func-\ntional characteristics of the Rotationslautsprecher are\nso distinctive that the more likely reason was a compo-\nsitional imperative, predicated on developing the tech-\nniques of point source sound mapping used in Gesang\nder J\u00fcnglinge in ways which would not obfuscate the\nheightened perceptual clarity and ultimate complexity\nthat could thus be achieved.\nThe construction score of Kontakte, which describes\nthe processes of synthesis in intricate detail, provides\nfertile ground for such lines of enquiry. This informa-\ntion, however, can only provide part of what needs to\nbe evaluated here. It is not sufficient simply to identify\nwhat technical procedures were used to distribute the\ncontributing sound materials within the soundfield.\nA true insight into the creative process requires an\nunderstanding of how these procedures were used, in\nother words investigating the nature of Stockhausen\u2019s\ntechn\u00e9. The proposition here is that important clues in\nthis context are to be found in the work itself, requir-\ning both subjective and objective analysis of the sonic\nresults.\nHere again, the constraints of the commercial\nrecording industry have conspired to greatly devalue\nthe true characteristics of this landmark work. Having\nbeen conceived from the outset as a four-channel\nwork, the necessary reduction into a stereo format had\nfar-reaching consequences. It is not generally known\nthat Stockhausen withdrew the first stereo release of\nthe tape-only version of the work in order to replace it\nwith a remixed version. The buying public were none\nthe wiser since DGG used exactly the same record\nnumber (DGG 138 811) and cover. For the first\nversion, the back left and front left channels are simply\ncollapsed into a single left-hand channel, the same\ntechnique being applied to the two right-hand chan-\nnels. All the spatial characteristics associated with\nimages between the side pairs of channels were thus\ncompletely lost. The result in terms of the continu-\nously rotating sounds is an unsatisfactory pulsing\noscillation between the two stereo channels with\npauses at each extremity as a result of the loss of all\nback-to-front and front-to-back movements. For the\nsecond version, a more satisfactory sense of continu-\nous movement is achieved by panning the four chan-\nnels equidistantly across the stereo channels, thus\nachieving a much smoother left\u2013right representation\nof the rotational effects.\nEven the latter version, however, loses vital aspects\nof the spatial perspective of this work, the significance\nof which can only be appreciated in the original four-\nchannel format. A study of the latter reveals that all\nmanner of subtleties are employed at a \u2018micro\u2019 level,\nfor example, projecting two different mono sound\nsources simultaneously across the field of listening\nat right angles, using paired and diagonally opposite\nspeakers. Alternatively the projection of the same\nsignal from all four speakers creates the sense of the\nsound being physically located at the centre of the\nlistening area. More pronounced stepwise rotations of\nimages were also created by exploiting the short delay\nthat occurs when tape passes from the record head\nto the playback heads of a tape recorder. By chaining\nthe playback head of the first track of the four-track\nrecorder to the record heads of the second, and repeat-\ning these connections to create a loop, short bursts of\nsound could thus be rotated around each loudspeaker\nin turn.\n4. ANALYSIS AND RESYNTHESIS\nIn considering the characteristics of the Rotation-\nslautsprecher, the discussion has stepped beyond a\nspecific focus on tape-based spatialisation, and this\nexpanded perspective can profitably be explored a\nstage further, taking into consideration some of the\nkey aspects of the underlying techn\u00e9 as it was applied\nto the materials themselves. During the 1990s, inspired\nby the fruits of some investigative research into novel\nsynthesis methods during the 1980s, Michael Clarke\nturned his attention to both the technical characteris-\ntics and the underlying compositional aesthetic of\nthis work, starting in the first instance with the issues\nraised in this context in Stockhausen\u2019s article \u2018The\nconcept of unity in electronic music\u2019 (Stockhausen\n1962).\nClarke\u2019s account of his own investigations, pub-\nlished in 1998, provides an important endorsement for\none key aspect of the current line of enquiry. He notes\nthat:\n. . . the tape part of Kontakte . . .has a vibrancy often lack-\ning in electronic music, and this article therefore sets out\nto investigate whether any significant points of contact\ncan be discovered between Stockhausen\u2019s techniques of\nthe 1960s and those of today\u2019s computerised studio . . .\n(Clarke 1998: 222)\nFrom the preceding study it will be clear that the spe-\ncial techniques of sound projection and manipulation\nin space that were employed may provide some useful\n6Very little use seems to have been made of this device by composers\nat the Paris Studio. Since, as already noted, all works were recorded\nin a mono format until 1958, its only practical use could have been\nin performance situations.\nThe significance of techn\u00e9 89\npointers. Clarke, however, starts from a much deeper\nlevel within the compositional process, notably the\nrelationship of the microstructure at the lowest level of\nsynthesis to the associated macrostructure, a consider-\nation which is of particular significance in the com-\nposition of Kontakte. Here Stockhausen provides an\nimportant insight into his working methods when\ncomposing with tape:\nIntensity was controlled by regulating, with the aid of a\nvoltmeter, the voltages recorded on tape (whereby the\nspectrum itself automatically varied with the variations\nin intensity), whereas duration was determined simply by\nthe length of tape on which a sound was recorded.\n(Stockhausen 1962: 39)\nThe consequences of relying upon precise measure-\nments of time by means of measuring the lengths of\ntape used with a ruler, whilst at the same time relying\nupon the almost unquantifiable elements of interpre-\ntation resulting from the regulation of intensities by\nmeans of manual control, will be considered further in\ndue course. The key consideration for Clarke, already\nexplored to a more limited extent in Gesang der\nJ\u00fcnglinge, was the causal relationships between the\ninner durational structure of impulses, and the com-\nplex sound spectra that result when suitably irregular\npatterns of impulses are accelerated into the audio\nspectrum. Whereas modern digital technologies pro-\nvide a number of ways of synthesising material in this\nmanner, Stockhausen was entirely dependent on the\nfunctional characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the\ntape recorder. As Clarke observes:\nIn practice, Stockhausen would record pulses produced\nby a pulse-generator onto tape and, by cutting and splic-\ning, form these into a repeating tape loop. He would then\naccelerate the repeating sequence using a variable-speed\ntape recorder, often rerecording the result and repeating\nthe acceleration process many times over to achieve the\ndesired speed. In this way he was able to make transfor-\nmations between pulses and frequencies, rhythms and\ntimbres in a single continuous movement, as if part of one\nspectrum. (Clarke 1998: 223)\nClarke\u2019s curiosity with this method of impulse gen-\neration led to the discovery that the physical principles\ninvolved in this method of synthesis had many features\nin common with the impulse-based digital algorithm\nFOF he developed during the 1980s as an additional\nunit generator for the software synthesis program\nCsound. Whilst adding the caveat that the intention\nof his experiment was \u2018not to replicate the original\nbut rather to demonstrate that the techniques used by\nStockhausen are still available today in digital form\u2019\n(ibid.: 230), he tested the proposition by synthesising\na one-and-a-half minute segment of Kontakte, part\nof the score fragment reproduced and discussed\nin Stockhausen\u2019s article, starting at 16' 56.5\"\n(Stockhausen 1962: 19\u201320).\nThe result is extraordinary in its likeness to the origi-\nnal. And yet there is something slightly different.\nClarke himself gives an important clue as to why,\nwhen he notes that:\nStockhausen\u2019s analogue technique resulted in the sepa-\nrate creation of each pulse stream. . . . However the\nmixing of pre-synthesised streams did not allow him\nto have precise control over the synchronisation of\nthe streams at the micro level. At the mixing stage,\nsynchronisation depended on the visual alignment of\ntapes on different machines and was then subject to frac-\ntional differences in the starting mechanisms and speed\nof these machines. Although such differences were not of\nsignificance in terms of normal mixing procedures, they\nwould not have provided the control necessary for the\nsynchronisation of streams so as to ensure the precise\nalignment of pulses. (Clarke 1998: 230)\nPrecisely, or rather imprecisely: the very fact that such\nprecision was not possible identifies a crucial aspect\nof the techn\u00e9 that shaped and ultimately determined\nthe compositional process. The issue here is whether\nindeed it is the very precision provided by modern day\ndigital technology that removes a vital ingredient in\nterms of shaping the compositional aesthetic. To be\ndeliberately provocative, perhaps it is the imprecision\nassociated with the use of analogue technology that\nindeed accounts for the \u2018vibrancy lacking in electronic\nmusic\u2019 (ibid.: 222). No conclusions will be drawn here,\nfor the research evidence presented here is insufficient\nto come to a definitive view one way or the other. The\ncase for investigating these issues further, however,\nis compelling. Indeed it becomes irresistible when the\nproposition is tested a stage further.\nIn 1972, the Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) in\nStockholm completed the construction of a revolu-\ntionary studio that combined the flexibility of a\ndigitally controlled oscillator bank and associated\nprocessing devices with the power and versatility of a\nPDP 15 computer, used to program the operation of\nthe system. As a test of its capabilities, a decision was\ntaken to re-synthesise Stockhausen\u2019s Studie II, a work\ncomposed at Cologne in 1954. This task required the\nmeticulous translation of the detailed construction\nscore into the control language that had been specifi-\ncally developed for operating the devices in the studio,\nknown as EMS1. Stockhausen subsequently visited\nthe studio, and this realisation was played to him. He\nwas completely dismayed, observing that:\nSome time ago I suffered a terrible shock listening to my\nElektronische Studie II (Electronic Study II) in the elec-\ntronic music studio at Stockholm University, which has\na very up-to-date synthesizer. It was a performance\nrealised, according to the instructions published in the\nscore, but without my collaboration. Well, what hap-\npened? It was awful. A farce, to say the least, a caricature\nof the work. You could say goodbye to the precision\nof the microtempi! And goodbye to the subtleties, to the\n90 Peter Manning\nmovements of the spirit \u2014 all unjustified \u2018omissions\u2019,\nsince the score was supplied with precise rhythmic and\ndynamic annotations regarding duration, volume, and\nthe characteristics of the timbre. Instead of which there\nwas nothing. Why? Because they let the computer handle\nthe dynamic curves of the sound (H\u00fcllkurven) which I\nhad regulated, on the contrary, with manual controls.\nHence the static quality. (Tannenbaum 1987: 22)\nThese observations provide cogent evidence of the sig-\nnificance of techn\u00e9, indeed the very ways in which \u2018The\ncomposer\u2019s relationship to the materials and forms of\nhis\/her art . . . are mediated by those design tools\u2019 (Di\nScipio 1995b: 374). By \u2018precision\u2019, Stockhausen does\nnot mean the exact replication of the measurements\nrecorded in the construction score, but all the tiny\nvariations that occurred when cutting and splicing\ntape. Similarly, the manual control of amplitudes\nintroduced subtleties of interpretation unique to the\ncomposer, which cannot be deduced from the score.\nThus we arrive at a key issue identified with not a little\nirony by Landy in questioning of the value of \u2018rewind-\ning the tape\u2019 (Landy 1999: 63): that is, what is the rel-\nevance of studying the 1940s and 1950s for composers\nof today?\nThe proposition, on the evidence provided above, is\nthat there is still much to be investigated here, with the\ndual prospect of both gaining a more informed under-\nstanding of the repertory of past and also facilitating\nthe rediscovery and reinterpretation of past practices\nwhich might open up new ways of interacting and\nworking with modern technologies. There are there-\nfore compelling reasons for acquiring a much more\ninformed understanding of the techn\u00e9 of electroacous-\ntic music than has hitherto been the case, with parti-\ncular reference to the characteristics associated with\nworks produced during the formative and in many\nrespects the defining years of the medium.\nREFERENCES\nAdorno, T. 1958.
