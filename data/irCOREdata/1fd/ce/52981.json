Introduction \nEnvironmental issues bring to the fore the need for engineers to make material conservation a matter \nof high importance. Erosion (wear) and corrosion are known causes of a considerable amount of \nwastage in many high temperature applications where materials such as refractories are employed. \nTherefore, any means by which the life of the refractory could be extended would be ecomically \nadvantageous. The physical and chemical stability at high temperatures of refractory materials means \nthat they find wide usage in application areas such as linings for furnaces and incinerators. Such \noperating environments demand that the linings must withstand mechanical wear and chemical attack \nfrom the movement of heated solids, liquids and\/or gasses [1], as well as providing the optimum \namount of heat insulation [2]. This creates a dilemma for engineers working in this field since porous \nrefractories will act as effective insulators because porosity is inversely proportional to thermal \nconductivity [3], but will be susceptible to penetration by corrosive reagents during operation on \naccount of their open structure. Consequently the need arises to employ denser refractories which \ndegrade less due to their more closely packed structure [4]. Clearly, neither solution is ideal and so \nthe protection of refractories exposed to aggressive high temperature environments generally depends \non the formation of an effective diffusion barrier layer which possesses superior erosion and \ncorrosion properties to the bulk. Existing methods for providing improved erosion and corrosion \nprotection for refractories are based either on tailoring the manufacturing process or using a coating. \nTypically, tailoring of the manufacturing process involves techniques for densification of the \nrefractory material [2]. As for coatings, established technologies using chemical, mechanical and\/or \nthermal methods are employed to apply surface layers [5, 6]. However, problems such as residual \nstress generation, low production rates, coating stability, microcracking and porosity are often \nattendant with these methods [7, 8]. \nIt is a distinct possibility that the technology of laser materials processing may offer a viable \nalternative to the existing methods for improving the erosion and corrosion resistance of refractories. \nMoreover, many of the disadvantages associated with the existing methods may be eliminated due to \nthe operating characteristics of laser technology. However, despite this, investigations into the laser \nprocessing of refractories are few in number. Work by Bradley et al. examined the surface treatment \nof alumina-based refractories with CO2 and HPDLs [9, 10] and a xenon arc lamp [11], whilst \nLawrence and Li [12] studied the laser beam interaction characteristics of the Al2O3-based refractory \nconsidered in this work. In contrast, several successful studies have shown the feasibility of using \nlasers to improve the surface characteristics of various ceramic and composite materials. The \nremelting of ZrO2-based protective ceramic layers using a CO2 laser [13] was shown to result in a \nmarked decrease in the level of structural defects. Further, the CO2 laser remelting of a number of \noxide ceramic coatings has been found to effect significant improvements in corrosion resistance \n 4 \n[14], whilst the CO2 laser remelting of Al2O3 and Al2O3-TiO2 coatings yielded an increase in hardness \nand wear resistance [15]. After excimer laser treatment of the surface of Al2O3, Cappelli et al. [16] \nnoted changes in the surface chemistry and morphology of the material, whilst Wu et al. [17] found \nthat excimer laser treatment of Al2O3-SiC occasioned surface smoothing and an increase in the \ntoughness of the material. The surface glazing of mullite with a HPDL by Schmidt and Li [18] \nresulted in a glaze that exhibited good adherence to the bulk ceramic but was severely cracked. To \ndate, many studies have been carried out to investigate the laser surface processing of concrete. As \npart of nuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [19-22] conducted research to determine the \nworkability of several laser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete \nsurfaces. Work by Sugimoto et al. [23] and Wignarajah et al. [24] focused upon modifying the \nsurface appearance and surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. \nBorodina et al. [25] has carried out investigations into the structural changes within the composition \nof zirconia concrete caused by surface exposure to CO2 laser radiation. More detailed and \ncomprehensive studies conducted by Lawrence and Li have investigated the feasibility and \ncharacteristics of HPDL generated glazes on the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) surface of concrete \n[26, 27]. In further work Lawrence and Li carried out a comparison of the glazes generated with both \nCO2 and HPDL\u2019s [28, 29].  \nThis present work is concerned with examining and quantifying the wear characteristics of a glaze \ngenerated on the surface of an Al2O3-based refractory by means of high power diode laser (HPDL) \nradiation. This is of particular interest since the inherent compact and robust nature of the HPDL \nenables it to be portable. Other industrial lasers only allow the workpiece to be processed at a \ndedicated laser work station, whereas on the other hand, the HPDL can be used for on-site \nprocessing.  \n2. Experimental procedures \nThe material used in the experiments was an Al2O3-based refractory containing various impurities. \nThe composition by weight of the refractory is as follows: Al2O3 (83.5%), SiO2 (9%), Cr2O3 (4.5%), \nP2O5 (1.6%), Fe2O3 (0.4%), TiO2 (0.3%), MgO (0.3%), NaO2 (0.2%), CaO (0.1%) and K2O (0.1%). \nThe refractory material studied is used commercially as a lining in industrial furnaces and \nincinerators. The refractory was obtained (from Cleanaway) in the form of blocks (200 x 200 x 100 \nmm\n3\n). The as-received blocks typically contained 12% porosity with aggregates of 1 to 3 mm in size \nbeing evenly distributed throughout the bricks. Furthermore, small sized cracks and porosities were \ngenerally visible on the surfaces of the as-received samples. For the purpose of experimental \nconvenience the as-received refractory blocks were sectioned into small cubes (20 x 20 x 10 mm\n3\n) \n 5 \nwith only two-thirds being laser treated. The selected refractory samples were treated with both lasers \nat room temperature and in normal atmospheric conditions. \nA HPDL (Diomed, D120) emitting at 810\u00b120 nm with a maximum output power of 120 W was used \nin this work. The beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 1 mm core diameter \noptical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly. The laser operated in \nthe continuous wave (CW) mode and produced a multi-mode beam. The defocused HPDL beam was \nfired across the surface of the as-received Al2O3-based refractory samples by traversing the samples \nbeneath the beam using the x- and y-axis of 3-axis computerised numerical control (CNC) gantry \ntable. In order to protected the laser optics a coaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 10 l\/min was \nused. Further characterisation of the HPDL generated glazes was carried out using optical \nmicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray \ndiffraction (XRD) techniques. \nTo determine the wear resistance characteristics of the HPDL generated glazes on the surface of the \nAl2O3-based refractory, and also those of the as-received surface, wear tests were conducted in \naccordance with Fig. 1. All the samples, as-received and laser treated, were weighed and then \nclamped individually in the vice of a common shaping machine. A steel abrader was attached to the \nfloating head of the shaping machine and moved cyclically back and forth across the as-received and \nlaser glazed Al2O3-based refractory surfaces. The total distance moved in one cycle was 6 mm while \nthe traverse speed was 180 mm\/min. By applying weights to the floating head a frictional force of 60 \nN was generated. The samples were subjected to the frictional force for 8 h, being removed from the \nmachine and weighed at 2 h intervals. \n3. Results \nThe resistance of any material to wear is related primarily to the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with the that of other materials with which it comes into contact [30]. However, wear \nresistance is not directly proportional to hardness, nor does it always increase with hardness [31]. Fig. \n2 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for the HPDL generated glaze and \nthat of the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surface. As is clear from Fig. 2 that the wear resistance \nof HPDL generated glaze effected a considerable increase in wear resistance over the as-received \nsurface, with the weight loss being approximately 1.5 times lower after 4 h, and 3 times lower after 8 \nh. \nTo ascertain what effect the HPDL generated glaze had on the corrosion resistance of the Al2O3-\nbased refractory in comparison with that of the as-received surface, corrosion resistance tests based \non BS 6431 [32] were conducted using nitric acid (HNO3) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The \n 6 \nexperiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive agents, in the concentration \nratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10%, on to the as-received and laser glazed surfaces of the Al2O3-\nbased refractory at hourly intervals for 4 h. Thereafter the samples were examined optically and \nsubjected to the mechanical wear test described earlier (see Fig. 1). It is worth mentioning that high \nconcentrations of the corrosive agents were used simply to accelerate the tests.  \nBoth reagents in the concentrations 80% and 60% were seen to attack immediately the as-received \nsurface of the Al2O3-based refractory with a similar degree of severity. In marked contrast, the HPDL \nglazed surface displayed no discernible change in either morphology or microstructure. The variation \nin wear resistance of the as-received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory when exposed to the \nreagents with an 80% concentration is shown in Fig. 3. As is evident from Fig. 3, the wear resistance \nof the refractory is significantly affected when exposed to a corrosive environment. As one can see, \nthe weight loss of the as-received sample was approximately 4 times higher than the HPDL treated \nsurface after 4 h and approximately 10 times higher after 8 h for the HNO3. In the case of the NaOH, \nthe weight loss was slightly less after both 4 and 8 h. Conversely, only a marginal increase in the \nwear rate was observed for the HPDL glazed surface as Table 1 shows. \n4. Discussion \nFrom the results of the wear tests it is clear that the wear resistance characteristics of the Al2O3-based \nrefractory are greatly improved after surface glazing with the HPDL. This improvement in wear rate \nwas especially evident when the tests were conducted in corrosive environments. The distinct \ndifference in wear rate between the HPDL treated and as-received surface, in both normal and \ncorrosive environments, can be ascribed totally to the different surface structures. In the as-received \ncondition, the surface of the Al2O3-based refractory consists of a porous, randomly ordered structure, \nwhereas the HPDL glazed surface consists of a much more dense and consolidated structure that \ncontains fewer cracks and porosities. Also, it was noted that the HPDL generated glazes were much \nharder than the as-received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory, having a respective value of around \n6 compared to 2 on the Mohs scale. Such significant alterations in the nature of the surface of the \nAl2O3-based refractory will naturally afford the HPDL generated glaze better wear resistance over an \nas-received surface. In addition to the improvements in the wear resistance of the Al2O3-based \nrefractory realised after HPDL surface treatment, a marked difference in the corrosion resistance of \nthe material was observed after laser treatment also. Again, due to the much more dense and \nconsolidated structure of the laser generated glaze, coupled with the fact that it contains fewer \nporosities, the glaze will therefore possesses a greater resistance to corrosive reagents than the porous \nstructure of the as received surface of the Al2O3-based refractory.  \n 7 \nBased on the findings that reveal that the wear and corrosion characteristics of HPDL generated glaze \nexceed those of the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surface, it would be natural to assume that the \nlife characteristics of the HPDL laser glaze may also surpass those of the as-received Al2O3-based \nrefractory. However, in any analysis of the wear life of the two materials, the in-situ relative \nthickness of the HPDL treated and the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surface must be considered \nin order to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics. This is especially the case when \nconsidering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). Thus the \nincrease in wear life can be given by \n Increase in wear life =  \nLaser glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n (1) \nwhere, \nrateWear \nThickness Density.\n = lifeWear  (1a) \nThe wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the HPDL generated glaze over the as-received \nAl2O3-based refractory surface are given in Table 1. As one can see from Table 1, an increase in the \nwear life of the Al2O3-based refractory was occasioned after HPDL treatment regardless of the \nenvironment. In particular, it can be seen that the increase in wear life of the HPDL generated glaze \nover the as-received Al2O3-based refractory surface varied markedly depending on the working \nenvironment, perhaps expectedly becoming more pronounced in the corrosive conditions.  \n4. Conclusions \nMarked improvements in the wear and corrosion characteristics of an Al2O3-based refractory were \nobserved after surface treatment with a HPDL. What is more, the HPDL generated surface glaze was \nfound to effect an increase in the wear life of the Al2O3-based refractory in both normal and corrosive \n(NaOH and HNO3) environmental conditions. Under normal conditions the wear rate of the as-\nreceived Al2O3-based refractory surface was 7.13 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n, increasing dramatically to 51.25 \nmg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n and 78.75 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n when exposed to NaOH and HNO3 respectively. In contrast, only \nvery minor increases in the wear rate were experienced by the HPDL treated surface when tested in \nthe corrosive environments, increasing from 2.38 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n under normal conditions to 2.43 \nmg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n and 2.49 mg\/cm\n2\n\/h\n1\n when exposed to NaOH and HNO3 respectively. Life assessment \ntesting revealed that the HPDL generated glaze increased the wear life of the Al2O3-based refractory \nby 1.27 to 13.44 times depending upon the environment. It is asserted that the observed \nimprovements in the wear rate and wear life of the Al2O3-based refractory after HPDL surface \ntreatment are due to the generation of a surface with improved morphology and microstructure which \n 8 \nwas more resistant to wear in normal and corrosive environments. More specifically, the \nimprovements can be attributed to the fact that after HPDL treatment, the microstructure of the \nAl2O3-based refractory was altered from a porous, randomly ordered structure, to a much more dense \nand consolidated structure that contained fewer cracks and porosities. It is believed that considerable \neconomic and material benefits could be realised from the deployment of the HPDL-based technique \nfor generating effective and efficient coatings on the surface of the Al2O3-based refractory.  \n \n 9 \nReferences \n1.
