ISBN:\n0-7494-0711-5.\nThis publication is part of the Educational\nand Training Technology series edited by\nChris Bell of the University of Plymouth. It\nis aimed directly at teachers, trainers and\ninstructional designers who wish to incor-\nporate diagrams into their instructional\nmaterials.\nThe first section of the book deals with\ndiagrams in relation to learning processes and\nthe acquisition of visual, as opposed to\ntextual, information. Although a series of\nimportant points are clearly indicated, there\nis no reference to published work in the field,\nand this weakens the value of this section of\nthe book. Furthermore, there is a biblio-\ngraphy but it contains just fourteen entries.\nThis is not therefore a book to use in\nresearching visual literacy.\nThe central section of the work is concerned\nwith the design and production of instruc-\ntional diagrams, and here there is a wealth of\nstraightforward information and ideas presen-\nted in a clear and helpful manner which\nwould benefit even experienced instructional\ndesigners. One feature of this section in\nparticular, but also of the book in general, is\nthe use of a common thematic topic (a\npepper mill) for exemplary illustrations. This\ntechnique allows the writer to focus on\nspecific features of the illustrations without\nintroducing new, distracting information.\nHaving said that, I did feel that the book\nmight have benefited from including, at least\nin one section, a wider variety of illustrative\nexamples.\nThe final section is concerned with the role\nof diagrams in an instructional context and\nthe potential problems which a learner might\nhave in using diagrams. Again the approach\nis clear and useful.\nThe book is directed at less experienced\ninstructional designers or those who feel they\nshould be exploiting diagrams more com-\npletely. It contains a range of useful pro-\ncedural checklists, and draws together a\nnumber of selected issues ranging from\ndesign considerations to evaluation pro-\ncedures. It is a useful addition to the\npractitioner's bookshelf.\nDennis Moss, University of Wales at Cardiff\nHypertext in Context by C. McKnight, A.\nDillon and J. Richardson, Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1991. ISBN 0-521-\n37488-X.\nThe term hypertext was coined by Theodore\nNelson in 1967. He used it to describe\ninteractive systems which combine natural\nlanguage text with a computer's capacity for\ninteractive branching. Since it is now pos-\nsible to combine text with a variety of other\nforms of presentation (such as graphics,\naudio and video), the term hypermedia is\nnow often adopted for such systems, hyper-\ntext being reserved for applications based on\njust non-linear text. In this book, however,\nMcKnight et al refer to applications which\nembed document or information linking as\nhypertext, regardless of the modes of pre-\nsentation they employ. In other words, the\nterm hypertext is used in a generic way to\nrefer to electronic documents which utilize\nany number of presentation modalities.\n71\nReviews\nThe book is divided into eight chapters\nwhich together chart the development of\nhypertext from Aristotle (and the earliest\nnotions of inter-connected information)\nthrough the history of writing and hypertext\napplications to future potential.\nChapter 1 provides a discussion of the\nmeaning (or definition) of hypertext and its\npotential impact on the way people organize\ninformation. It is suggested that the 'real'\npotential of hypertext goes beyond the pro-\nvision of new ways of reading and writing to\nfundamental changes in the way people\nthink. This is followed by a discussion of\nsome of the historical highlights in the\ndevelopment of the hypertext paradigm, in-\ncluding mention of some of the key figures\nin the evolution of the concept.\nIn Chapter 2, the case for hypertext providing\nnew ways of thinking is further endorsed.\nHowever, it is argued that many conceptions\nabout the linearity of traditional textual\nsystems are inaccurate, and the basic charac-\nter of both oral and written information is\nquestioned. This is used to focus on the idea\n(popularly attributed to McLuhan) that the\nmedium determines the message. The evolu-\ntion of written language is then discussed in\ngreat detail, with emphasis being given to\nchanges in the style and purpose of written\nmaterial. Within this context, various tech-\nniques for the production of textual resources\nare described (such as printing and the\norganization of printed material into books).\nThere is then a discussion of the impact these\ndevelopments have had on the cognitive\nskills of readers.\nChapter 3 concentrates on a reader-centred\nanalysis of hypertext. The fact that paper-\nbased text and hypertext constitute different\nmedia is noted, and this is followed by a\npsychological and physiological discussion of\nreader characteristics. This includes a\ndescription of the physical characteristics of\nthe human visual system and the findings of\nresearch into the cognitive ergonomics of\nscreen-based text. Then a classification for\ninformation types is developed. The classifi-\ncation of textual documents is based on three\ndimensions which relate to: how they are\nread, why they are read, and what informa-\ntion they contain. This brings to the fore a\nclear concern with looking at hypertext in the\ncontext of actual tasks, since a simple\ncomparison of the effectiveness of paper-\nbased text as opposed to hypertext is un-\nrealistic without an account of the types of\ntask users wish to perform with the particular\ninformation resource in question.\nChapter 4 deals with the idea that departure\nfrom linear information structures can cause\nusers to become lost within an information\nspace. The psychology of navigation is\ndiscussed both within the context of paper-\nbased and electronic documents, taking into\naccount the types of schemata and models\nused for navigation within textual environ-\nments. The way in which users can construct\ncognitive maps of the information space is\ndealt with, along with the ways in which\nsuch maps can provide navigational know-\nledge. There is also an outline of the ways in\nwhich metaphors can be used to address\nnavigational problems.\nConversion from text to hypertext is the\nsubject of Chapter 5, where techniques for\nconverting paper-based resources are contras-\nted with approaches involving the develop-\nment of original hypertext materials. The\nunderlying structures are also treated, and\nconsideration given to implementations\nwhich retain an underlying linear structure\nwhile facilitating web-like semantic links\nthroughout the knowledge corpus. Semantic\nnetworks are described along with the defi-\nciencies that can result from embedding\ninformation within a network structure.\n72\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nChapter 6 deals with the potential effective-\nness of hypertext within applications aimed\nat learning and education. A general view of\neducation is briefly covered, followed by a\nlook at the question of whether hypertext can\nplay an effective role in the fulfilment of\neducational goals viewed in terms of both\ndevelopmental and performance criteria. In-\ndividual learner characteristics are also\nbriefly discussed along with the concept of\nincidental learning which may occur while\nbrowsing.\nChapter 7 presents an outline of a practical\nimplementation of a hypertext system. The\nHypertext Database is an application inten-\nded to support research workers with the\nobjective of discovering whether a hypertext\ndatabase can be of significant use to people\nwho would ordinarily use a paper-based\nequivalent. The system is described in detail\nalong with the findings of experimental work\ninto its effectiveness.\nThe final chapter, not surprisingly, looks at\nthe future potential of hypertext, and identi-\nfies some key areas for future research. Areas\nsuch as computer supported co-operative\nwork and intelligent hypertext are briefly\ntreated, and an attempt is made to clarify the\noverall position of the authors with regard to\nhypertext.\nThere is a glossary, a reference list, an author\nindex and a subject index - facilities essential\nin a book like this which makes significant\nand useful reference to related work. The\nglossary is atypical, however, since it con-\nsists entirely of short descriptions of hyper-\ntext systems, not definitions of keywords.\nI cannot fully endorse all the ideas presented\nin this book, but it is readable, and it will no\ndoubt prove useful.\nStephen Richards, University of Teesside\nHypertext: a Psychological Perspective\nedited by C. McKnight, A. Dillon and J.\nRichardson, Chichester, Ellis Horwood,\n1993. ISBN: 0-13-441643-0.\nThis is an edited volume of seven chapters,\neach discussing the design of electronic text\nand how that design might be informed by\npsychological theory. Good coverage is given\nto most of the key controversial issues. This\ncould be a useful book for students as well as\na provocative one for researchers active in\nthis area.\nThe editors adopt a commonplace view that\nthere are really three relevant traditions of\npsychological theorizing to contemplate.\nFirst, there is Behaviourism. Hardly anyone\nclaims Behaviourism as an inspiration any\nmore, but custom requires that it is identified\nand vigorously dismissed. Certainly, no chap-\nter here represents this position. Secondly,\nthere is cognitive psychology\/science. Nick\nHammond contributes a very readable chap-\nter exploring the dominant themes from this\ntradition. He briefly reviews key empirical\nresearch, and derives a sort of learning cube:\na figure comprising three dimensions of\ncomputer-based learning (and finding accom-\nmodation for hypertext in a rather murky\ncorner of this shape.)\nBehaviourism and Cognitivism differ in their\npreferred conceptual vocabulary for analys-\ning knowing and learning. In particular, they\ndisagree on the need to theorize in terms of\nsymbols and symbol-relations within private\nrepresentational systems. This seems a fairly\nstark alternative: deal with behaviour or with\ninformation processing. It is hard to imagine\nhow there could be an in-between perspec-\ntive. But a third theoretical tradition identi-\nfied here is claimed to occupy the middle\nground. This third tradition is Constructiv-\nism. Donald Cunningham and colleagues\narticulate such a position and illustrate, step\n73\nReviews\nby step, how electronic media can be made\nto harmonize with it.\nOf the other chapters in the book, three are\nfocused on more particular features of psy-\nchoogical theorizing and how they inform the\ndevelopment of hypertext. So, Patricia\nWright considers what can be learned from\nempirical research on reading. Then the\neditors themselves have written a chapter\nlocating 'navigation' as a general topic\nwithin Psychology - and, of course, relating\nthis to thinking about hypertext development.\nFinally, David Jonassen reports some studies\nexploring the effects of making the semantic\nnetwork of expert knowledge explicitly avail-\nable in the linking structures of a hypertext\napplication, thus relating hypertext design to\nmodels of semantic memory.\nThere are two more chapters. Peter Whalley\nstarts the book with a critical essay on the\n(liberation) rhetoric of hypertext, and Tho-\nmas Landauer and colleagues describe a\nseries of elegant experiments that make up\nthe formative development of their high-\nspecification electronic book. Landauer's\nchapter gives the strongest sense of progress\narising from research (it is also the longest\npiece - occupying a third of the book). But\nthe chapter reminds us of an important\ndistinction: electronic text for information\nretrieval versus for learning. These resear-.\nchers are clearly working with the former:\ntheir 'SuperBook' is a technical manual for\ntelephone engineers. The challenge of\ndesigning this kind of document seems more\namenable to cognitive psychological research\nmethods (and less dependent on highly\narticulated theory).\nMost of the other authors in this volume are\noriented towards creating tools for learning,\nand here progress seems more halting. In the\nend, I fear the truth may be that Psychology\nis not delivering the goods for this enterprise.\nFor example, Wright feels obliged to con-\nclude: 'Despite a century of work on the\npsychology of reading there is no theory of\nthe reader that designers can employ to\ndevelop a usable hypertext document from\nfirst principles.' For me, this tends to expose\nPsychology as a rather narrow discipline.\nHere is a hint of it taken from within this\nbook: studies described in one chapter are\nsaid to be 'concerned with the psychology of\ninformation access by humans.' 'Humans'?\nWell, this is a discipline over-anxious to\naffiliate with biology (and, of course, com-\nputer science). A discipline where people\nparticipating in research are often termed S's.\nIn short, Psychology is curiously isolated\nfrom the culture of other social sciences -\nand not very interested in their progress. For\nproblems defined in the present context, this\nprobably matters. So, greater sensitivity to\ndevelopments in literary theory, discourse\nanalysis, ethnography or semiotics might\nenrich empirical research on some of the\nproblems defined in this book (for example,\nthe topical social science interest in 'narra-\ntive' rather passes Psychology by). Psycho-\nlogy is also a discipline fixated on one\nparticular conceptual vocabulary for\nanalysing cognition: dwelling on component\nprocesses manifest by de-contextualized\nactors - usually acting in the abstract settings\nof laboratories. So, for example, it is very\nrare in psychological literature on 'learning'\nto find reference to (or a presence in) the\nevents of classrooms.\nThis is Cognitivism. Could the so-called\nmiddle ground of Constructivism then be an\nalternative way forward? I find the charac-\nterization of Cunningham et al here too\nsweeping; it blurs too many important dis-\ntinctions (for instance, they say their position\nis 'variously labelled constructivism,\nexperientialism, semiotics'). However, by\nany account, Constructivism remains a Cog-\nnitivist tradition, albeit one that has a\nwelcome emphasis on studying activities\n74\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nduring the circumstances of learning. I\nbelieve there is an alternative theoretical\nperspective. Hammond flirts with it briefly in\na section (also rather broad brush) on situated\naction and affordances. Alas, the editors\nchose to defuse this with the label 'new\nbehaviorism'. Cunningham et al embrace it\nas socio-cultural theory, but it fails to surface\non their landscape as a distinctive alternative.\nA more socially grounded theory of mind\nmight help in many ways. One would be in\nforcing us to take seriously the significance\nof context. If this volume captures represen-\ntative 'psychological' research on hypertext\n(and I think it does), what is striking is a lack\nof concern for the broader settings in which\nthese computer-based applications get used.\nOur understanding of this new medium will\nbe impoverished until we take seriously both\nthe interpretative practices that particular\nconstituencies of users bring to it, and the\nbroader framework of teaching and learning\ninto which it gets variously located. I take\nWhalley to be raising these issues in a\nhelpful way, and his is a chapter that I wish\nwas longer.\nYet, this book is a balanced, accessible\noverview of recent research. I found it\nhelpful in provoking new lines of thought on\nthe subject in my own mind, and I am sure it\nwill do so for many other readers, although\nnot necessarily the same lines of thought!\nCharles Crook, University of Durham\nThe Art and Science of Computer Anima-\ntion by Stuart Mealing, Oxford, Intellect,\n1992. ISBN: 1-871516-16-1.\nComputer animation is the creation of the\nillusion of movement from discrete static\nimages on a computer screen. It is an\nemerging discipline which embraces a wide\nrange of subject areas, spanning both the arts\nand the sciences. There are many books\navailable which deal with the mathematics,\ngeometry and programming of computer\ngraphics, while others deal with the tradi-\ntional animation techniques used by the film\nindustry, but there are very few which deal\nwith the integrated subject of computer\nanimation at any length. This book aims to\nfill that gap.\nIt is divided into two main parts. Part 1\ncovers the basic background material necess-\nary to gain a full understanding of computer\nanimation. The first chapter introduces tradi-\ntional animation techniques in relation to the\nrole of the computer, and the following\nchapters describe various applications of\ncomputer animation (from TV graphics to\nmedical imaging), the basic principles of\ncomputer graphics and movement control,\nand various hardware and software conside-\nrations.\nPart 2 builds on Part 1, describing in greater\ndetail the latest developments in the area,\nincluding an attempt to predict the future\napplications of emergent technologies. The\nbook concludes with detailed technical\nappendices, a glossary of terms and a\nbibliography. It is produced to a very high\nstandard, attractively laid out with numerous\neffective illustrations.\nIn fact, this is certainly one of the most\nreadable computing texts I have encountered.\nIt well conveys the author's enthusiasm for\nhis subject: clearly, computer animation\nshould be fun, yet this does not make the\nbook lightweight. What is most impressive is\nthat all the necessary subject areas are dealt\nwith comprehensively enough to make it an\nexcellent starting point for those readers\nseriously considering undertaking a com-\nputer-animation project. Little prior know-\nledge of either mathematics or computing is\nassumed, making it possible for the more\ngeneral reader to develop a broad understand-\n75\nReviews\ning of the field. And a comprehensive\nbibliography, combined with recommended\ntexts, enables interested readers to make\nfurther inroads.\nMost importantly, the author has concentra-\nted on concepts and principles, rather than on\nsupplying pages of mathematical formulae,\nor the ephemeral minutiae of proprietary\nhardware and software. This was a wise\nchoice which will maximize the shelf-life of\nthe book - an important consideration, with\nthe rapidly increasing rate of technological\nadvance. However, to provide balance, a case\nstudy, The Making of Pencil Test, from a\npaper by Galyn Susman of Apple Computer,\nis supplied in an appendix. This paper\ndescribes in detail the complete process of\nmaking a computer animation, and is particu-\nlarly useful as it highlights the realistic\nday-to-day problems which must be dealt\nwith during production.\nWhile the book provides a great deal of\nuseful information throughout, it is the\nmaterial contained in Part 2 which makes it\nan essential read, since much of the material\nin Part 1 is available in a range of other texts\n(though this is not a criticism). In Part 2, I\nwould single out Chapters 9 to 12 as being of\nparticular merit. These are effectively state-\nof-the-art reviews of the areas of simulation,\nsoft modelling, behavioural animation and\nthe simulation of human movement: inform-\nation which is not readily available else-\nwhere.\nIn all, I can confidently recommend this book\nto students, industry professionals, and any\nenthusiasts who wish to learn about computer\nanimation.\nLorraine Warren, University of Hull\nInstant Multimedia for Windows 3.1 by\nKris Jamsa, New York, John Wiley and\nSons, 1993. ISBN: 0-471-58972-1.\nThe use of computer systems for the gener-\nation and delivery of multimedia resources\n(text, sound, static pictures, animation and\nmotion video) is growing rapidly. The ease\nwith which these activities can be undertaken\nis also rapidly increasing. This is due mainly\nto the advent of the MPC (Multimedia\nPersonal Computer) and the general avail-\nability and popularity of graphical user\ninterfaces. This book is timely in that it\nprovides a technical (and very readable)\nintroduction to multimedia generation and\napplications using Windows version 3.1. It\nalso offers hands-on use of a PC, since it\ncomes with two floppy disks containing a\nrange of multimedia material linked to\nvarious chapters.\nThere are 23 chapters. Some of them are\nvery short but all are to the point. Together,\nthey cover most of the important aspects of\nmultimedia deliverable on a PC, although\ncertain topics (such as digital full-motion\nvideo) are not treated in any great depth.\nThere are also two appendices and a detailed\nsubject index, but unfortunately there is no\nbibliography; nor does the author makes any\nreference whatosever to other sources of\ninformation, not even a Windows 3.1\nmanual!\nThe book is organized into four broad\nsections. The first (chapters 1 to 10) deals\nprimarily with the creation and use of sound.\nThe second (chapters 11 to 14) treats\nCD-ROM and its applications, the MPC\nstandard, and more advanced uses of sound.\nThe third (chapters 15 to 20) deals with\nfonts, scanners, video and animation. The\nfinal section (chapters 21 to 23) covers a\nrange of topics including future possibilities\nand applications.\n76\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nThe first two chapters serve to introduce\nsimple sound effects (based on the MPC's\ninternal speaker) using the driver and digital\nsound files provided on the companion disks.\nChapter 3 covers multimedia screen savers,\nwhile Chapter 4 (being slightly more 'acade-\nmic' in that it deals with the physics of\nsound) brings out the relationship between\nsound quality, storage requirements and digi-\ntization parameters. Chapter 5 introduces a\nprogram called Excuses which uses the\ndigital sound effects provided on one of the\ncompanion disks in a variety of interesting\nways, and Chapter 6 gives the reader the task\nof experimenting with the speaker driver by\nexploring various customization parameters\nand the ways in which they effect sound\nquality. Chapter 7 introduces another pro-\ngram called Presidents which offers multi-\nmedia information about some of the pre-\nsidents of the United States. It is possible to\nexplore a textual biography, listen to a\nquotation and view a photograph of any of\nthe seven presidents included in the demonst-\nration.\nChapter 8 introduces the MPC standard by\ndescribing the basic configuration required to\nsupport it and the facilities it should offer\n(such as a sound board and a CD-ROM\ndrive). The 'Ultimedia' (IBM's MPC render-\ning based on a PS\/2) is also mentioned.\nSound boards are treated in greater depth,\nhowever, in Chapter 9 (here, the material on\nIRQs and DMA transfers is quite useful),\nwhile Chapter 10 deals with how to use a\nboard to record and mix sound using the\nWindows Sound Recorder accessory. Further\nmaterial on sound effects is presented in the\ntwo subsequent chapters, the first of which\ndescribes the Windows Media Player, MCI\n(Media Control Interface) and the control of\nexternal devices such as CD-ROM drives,\nvideodiscs, and so on, while the second\ndescribes the purpose and use of MIDI\n(Musical Instrument Digital Interface).\nIn Chapter 11 the author introduces some\nbasic material on CD-ROM drives and their\nassociated optical discs. This is followed in\nChapter 12 by a fairly detailed description of\nthe various multimedia and hypermedia elec-\ntronic books that make up the Microsoft\nBookshelf CD for Windows (Jhe American\nHeritage Dictionary, Bartlett's Familiar\nQuotations, The Concise Columbia Diction-\nary of Quotations, The Concise Columbia\nEncyclopedia, Hammond's Atlas, Roget's\nElectronic Thesaurus, and The World\nAlmanac and Book of Facts). Further exam-\nples of multimedia CD books are described\nin Chapter 22.\nThe visual mode of communication is con-\nsidered in more detail in chapters IS to 20.\nThese cover a wide range of topics such as\nfonts (vector, raster and outline) and their use\nin both textual and multimedia documents\n(created by Write and Paintbrush), scanners\nand their applications (for creating image\ncollections and OCR work), digital electronic\ncameras, and the use of bit-map images as\nwallpaper for use in Windows screens. The\n'theory' of video is covered somewhat\nsuperficially in Chapter 18, while the next\ntwo chapters treat animation. Some examples\nof animation and video clips from the\ncompanion discs are used to illustrate the\nkind of thing that can be done with an\nanimation package - in this case, Autodesk\nAnimator.\nThe last three chapters deal with future\npossibilities (such as virtual reality, new\nways of publishing information in multi-\nmedia documents, and the potential utility of\nmultimedia techniques in education). Chapter\n22 gives a very useful overview of a number\nof currently available multimedia CD pub-\nlications such as Multimedia Beethoven,\nSurvey of Western Art (which contains over\n1,000 images and 300 biographies), Sherlock\nHolmes, Consulting Detective (which embeds\n77\nReviews\nmotion video), Time Table of History,\nScience and Innovation, Mammals - a Multi-\nmedia Encyclopedia, Compton's Multimedia\nEncyclopedia, and various hypertextual CD\napplications such as Ebert's Movie Home\nCompanion. The final chapter describes some\nof the ways in which sound effects can be\nincorporated into other Windows applications\nsuch as spreadsheets, memos, electronic mail\nand applications programs using the Win-\ndows OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)\nfacility.\nWhat one has here is therefore a good overall\nintroduction to the topic of multimedia. The\nmaterial is sometimes of a technical nature,\nbut the book itself is written in a way which\nmakes that material understandable even to\nthe novice. In fact, it should provide a\nhelpful exposure for readers who are coming\nat this topic for the first time, and who\nrequire a guided exploratory approach to\nmultimedia.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nProducing Teaching Materials: a Hand-\nbook for Teachers and Trainers by Henry\nEllington and Phil Race, 2nd Edition,\nLondon, Kogan Page, 1993. ISBN: 0-\n7494-0393-4.\nNeither of the reviewers of this book was\nfamiliar with the first edition. That was no\ndisadvantage - books should be current,\nupdate or not. As the authors recognize in\ntheir introduction, preparing a second edition\nraises the vexatious question of what to leave\nout from the first, published in 1985. Since\nthen, document preparation and the produc-\ntion of teaching materials has undergone a\ntechnological revolution at all levels of\neducation and training, and is still running.\nThere are signs that the baggage from the last\ndecade has slowed the authors down in their\nattempts to keep up.\nIn most areas there is an admirable linkage\nbetween the technology and the learning\nobjectives. A good example is the section of\nChapter 2 on printed materials which deals\nhead-on with the current interest in open and\nflexible learning, provides definitions, and\nasks the pertinent questions anyone consider-\ning a venture in this area should be able to\nanswer. As is appropriate for what is still the\nmost widely used medium, print is covered in\nsome detail. But do we still need to know\nhow a stencil duplicator or even off-set litho\nwork?\nChapter 3 discusses the use of non-projected\ndisplay materials, posters, flipcharts, and\nmagnetic boards. It includes a section on how\na chalkboard should and should not be used.\nWe are not sure which concerns us most; that\nthis section should be in the book at all, or\nthat teachers at all levels in education\nactually need the instruction. The production\nof still projected display materials is detailed\nin Chapter 4 with some excellent reference\ndata on layout of OHTs and 35 mm slides.\nThere is also a useful discussion on the\nmanagement of a library of these materials.\nProduction of audio materials is looked at in\nsome depth in Chapter 5. The section on\ndesign and management of the materials is\npractical and to the point, though some of the\ntechnical aspects as presented would serve to\nconfuse and frighten off certain teachers who\nmight be considering the use of this medium.\nIt was delightful, however, to see Chapter 6\ngiven over to the production of tape-slide\nmaterial, which provides an effective linking\nof the techniques discussed in the preceding\nchapters.\nVideo technology is dealt with only three-\nquarters of the way through the book in\nChapter 7, which might be an appropriate\nallocation of space for those working in\nprimary and secondary education, whose\nfunds are tightly constrained. For further and\n78\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 2\nhigher education, however, with many insti-\ntutions now providing audiovisual services\ncentrally, the teachers might feel short-\nchanged.\nWith millions being spent on the Teaching\nand Learning Technology Programme, Chap-\nter 8's 30 pages on the role of computers in\nthe classroom is miserly, given the multitude\nof applications. Many of the photographs in\nthis section already look dated, and in some\ncases risible, such as those on two pages\nwhere essentially the same configuration is\nfirst captioned as a multimedia workstation\nand then as being used for computer con-\nferencing. With computer technology advanc-\ning so fast in the time it takes to read a book,\nlet alone in the time it takes to write one, the\nauthors clearly had difficulties. The book has\nthus tended to concentrate on the principles\nand concepts of using computers in different\nteaching and learning situations. It looks at\nsome concepts like multimedia and authoring\nlanguages, and at some of the new technolo-\ngies, including CD-I and electronic books.\nThe chapter, and book, ends with a couple of\ncase studies. Somewhere along the way, the\nbalance between the treatment of the old and\nnew technologies has gone astray. The\noutcome is a book whose primary use would\nbe as a student reference to how things used\nto be.\nMike Kibby and Stephen Welsh, University\nof Strathclyde\nInteractive Multimedia - Promise and\nPitfalls, edited by Colin Latchem, John\nWilliamson and Lexie Henderson-Lancett,\nKogan Page, London, 1993. ISBN: 0-\n7494-0815-4.\nVirtually all forms of learning depend on\neffective communication. Multimedia\napproaches to knowledge transfer are attrac-\ntive because the limitations and inadequacies\nof one channel of communication can usually\nbe compensated for by the advantages of\nanother. Also, introducing interactivity into\ncommunication mechanisms gives the reci-\npient of a message considerable control over\nthe nature of the information received and\nhow it is presented. For reasons such as\nthese, interactive multimedia would seem to\noffer significant potential for the design and\nimplementation of effective and efficient\ncommunication mechanisms. This book\nexplores some of the possibilities, and\ndescribes some current approaches to using\ninteractive multimedia in an educational\nsetting.\nThe book was originally conceived as a\nresult of an international conference held in\nJanuary 1992 in Perth, Western Australia,\nand several of the papers presented at this\nconference are included, along with others\nthat have been specially commissioned.\nThere are 12 chapters, produced by an\ninternational group of authors from Australia,\nCanada, The Netherlands, the UK and the\nUSA. All are well-written, and each contains\na useful list of references. A glossary, author\nindex and subject index are also provided.\nThe opening chapter, written by the editors,\ngives an overview of interactive multimedia,\noutlining its basic nature and discussing the\nrole of instructional design and the problems\nof introducing new technologies into learning\nenvironments.\nThis is followed by a chapter by Nigel Paine\nand Philip McAra which is mainly technical.\nIt offers a summary of current developments\nin interactive multimedia, such as authoring\nsystems, MPC, AVI, CD-ROM, DVI, CD-I,\nCD-ROM XA, Photo CD, interactive video\nand virtual reality.\nIn Chapter 3, Alexander Romiszowski dis-\ncusses the problems of developing interactive\nmultimedia courseware and communication\n79\nReviews\nnetworks to support teaching and learning. In\ndoing so, he raises a number of relevant\ndesign issues, such as the dichotomy between\nthe instructional and informational roles that\ninteractive multimedia can play.\nChapter 4 (by Thomas Reeves) discusses the\ncurrent lack of research foundations to\nsupport the use of interactive multimedia,\nthen goes on to describe some possible\ndirections of future development based on\nconstructivism, exploratory case studies and\ncomputer modelling.\nIn Chapter 5, Stephen Heppell outlines the\nhistorical development of educational com-\nputing in terms of four overlapping stages,\nthen discusses some of the changes needed to\nmake it more pedagogically effective. Some\ninteresting illustrations taken from the\nXploratorium are presented.\nPeter Olaf Looms continues the educational\ntheme in Chapter 6 by dealing with the use\nof interactive multimedia at the schools level,\ndescribing the current state of the art in both\nNorth America and Europe, and concluding\nby discussing some obstacles that need to be\novercome before interactive multimedia will\nbecome widely used in schools and colleges.\nIn Chapter 7, Jenny Preece describes multi-\nmedia and hypermedia and their potential for\nthe support of interactive learning, giving\nspecial consideration to human factors issues.\nThe contribution by William Tan and Ann\nNguyan (Chapter 8) treats lifecycle costing\nmodels for interactive multimedia systems,\nthen compares the cost-effectiveness of three\ndifferent approaches to providing computer-\nbased instruction with conventional instruc-\ntor-led classroom presentations. Although the\ncostings used relate to Australian experience,\nthe models would be generally applicable to\nother situations and the same is to some\nextent true for Chapters 9 and 10, where two\ninteresting Australian projects are described.\nLyn Henderson outlines the difficulties invol-\nved in overcoming cultural problems using\ninteractive multimedia methods (based on\nMacintosh computers) within a remote-area\nteacher education programme (RATEP) in\nNorth Queensland. In Chapter 10, Ian Con-\nboy deals with the use of audiographic\ntelematics in schools in order to improve\nretention rates. This project (called MAX)\nuses Macintosh computers, fax transmission\nand audio-conferencing methods in order to\ncreate an 'electronic classroom' made up\nfrom participating groups distributed geo-\ngraphically throughout the state of Victoria.\nThe last two chapters (11 and 12) deal\nrespectively with interactive multimedia in\nlibraries, and the creation of information\nproducts based on electronic publishing. In\nChapter 11, John Frylinck and David Raitt\nreview current technology, its potential roles\nin libraries, and ways in which libraries may\nhave to adapt in order to accommodate\ninteractive multimedia products such as elec-\ntronic books and multimedia encyclopedias.\nThe final chapter by Eric Lugtigheid\ndescribes a forward-looking Canadian ven-\nture called the Jean Talon Project, intended\nto produce a range of multimedia educational\nproducts dealing with various aspects of\nCanada: its political system, cultures, scienti-\nfic achievements, geography, and so on.\nI found this book readable and extremely\ninteresting. Although some parts of it have a\nnecessarily technical orientation, on the\nwhole most of it deals with conceptual issues\ninvolved in using interactive multimedia\nwithin educational and training settings.\nTaken together, the chapters form a well-\nbalanced whole, adequately reflecting the\ncurrent state of the art in interactive multi-\nmedia from an educational perspective.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\n80\n"}
