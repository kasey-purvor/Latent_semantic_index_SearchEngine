INTRODUCTION\nThe isospin breaking decay channel \u0001! !\u00020 has been\nmeasured by experiment with improved precisions [1], and\nthe Particle Data Group quote BR\u0002\u0001! !\u00020\u0004 \u0006\n\u00025:2\u00071:3\u00051:1\u0004 \b 10\u00055 as the world average for its branching\nratio [2]. This decay channel is very interesting due to\nthe presence of the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule viola-\ntion and isospin symmetry breaking together. These two\nmechanisms, which generally account for different aspects\nof the underlying dynamics, are correlated in this channel.\nWith the availability of much improved experimental in-\nformation about other related transitions, one can pursue a\nquantitative study of the underlying dynamics and learn\nmore about the correlation between the OZI rule violation\nand isospin symmetry breaking in the nonperturbative\nregime.\nThe electromagnetic (EM) decay of \u0001! !\u00020 is an\nimportant source of isospin violations, where the s and \u0001s\nannihilate into a virtual photon, which then decays into\n!\u00020. The other source of isospin violation originates from\nthe mass differences between the u and d quark [3]. It can\ncontribute to \u0001! !\u00020 via OZI-rule-violating strong\ndecays.\nIn the literature the isospin violation in \u0001! !\u00020 was\nstudied by isoscalar and isovector mixing, e.g. \u0001\u0005!\u0005\n\u00030 and\u00040 \u0005 \u0004\u0005 \u00020 mixings [4\u20139]. This scenario contains\nboth EM and strong transitions in an s-channel, and allow\nthe\u0001! !\u00020 decay without violating the OZI rule [10]. In\nsuch an approach, the EM and strong decays cannot be\nseparated out. An alternative view is to separate the EM\nand strong processes by explicitly introducing the EM\namplitude as an s-channel process, and then including\nthe hadronic loop contributions as the t-channel processes.\nThis will be our focus in this work. Our strategy is to\nconstrain the EM transition first, and a well-defined EM\ntransition will then allow us to make a reliable evaluation\nof the strong isospin violation mechanism.\nThe EM transitions can be studied in the vector meson\ndominance (VMD) model. Recently, a systematic inves-\ntigation of the role played by the EM transitions in\nJ= \u0002 0\u0004 ! VP, where V and P denote light nonet vector\nand pseudoscalar mesons, respectively, was reported in\nRefs. [11,12], and the up-to-date experimental data pro-\nvided a good constraint on the VMD model. For \u0001!\n!\u00020, the VMD approach has great advantages: on the\none hand, the \u0001 and ! meson masses are very close to\nthe \u0003mass. Hence, the EM form factors can be constrained\nby the precise data for the \u00030 meson mass and width [2].\nOn the other hand, since other heavier vectors are rather far\naway from this kinematic region, their contributions to the\nform factor will be limited. The dominant mechanisms can\nthus be clarified. The availability of experimental informa-\ntion for \u0001! \u0005\u00020 and \u0003\u0002\u0007 \u0002\u0007\u0002\u0005\u00020 [13] is also an\nadvantage for quantifying the EM contributions.\nThe isospin-violating strong decay can be related to the\nOZI rule violation at low energies via intermediate had-\nronic loops as proposed by Lipkin [14,15]. Microscopic\ninterpretation of such a scenario as a mechanism for the\nOZI rule violation was investigated by Geiger and Isgur in\na quark model [16,17]. For instance, an s\u0001s pair of 1\u0005 can\ncouple to nonstrange n \u0001n \t \u0002u \u0001u\u0007 d \u0001d\u0004= \u0001\u0001\u00012p via K \u0001K, K\u0003 \u0001K \u0007\nc:c:, etc. Suppressions of such an OZI-rule-violating pro-\ncess come from the cancellations between the intermediate\nmeson loops and off-shell effects on the intermediate states\n[18,19]. Qualitatively, at high energies, where the mass\nscale of the intermediate states becomes unimportant,\none would expect a \u2018\u2018perfect cancellation\u2019\u2019 among all those\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 77, 014010 (2008)\n1550-7998=2008=77(1)=014010(12) 014010-1 \u00a9 2008 The American Physical Society\nintermediate states, and it recovers the OZI rule. At low\nenergies, where the mass scale of the individual states is\ndominant, the perfect cancellation will break down due to\ne.g. mu \u0001 md originated from the chiral symmetry break-\ning. The OZI rule violations hence give rise to the recog-\nnition of isospin symmetry breakings.\nSuch a mechanism in \u0001! !\u00020 decay can be described\nas follows: In \u0001! !\u00020, the intermediate charged and\nneutral kaon loop transitions are supposed to cancel out\nif the isospin symmetry is conserved. However, due to\nsmall mass differences between the u and d quarks, the\ncharged and neutral kaons will also have small differences\nin mass, i.e. mK0 \u0005mK\n \u0006 3:972\n 0:027 MeV [2], and\nthey are coupled to the \u0001 meson with slightly different\nstrength. The hadronic loops will then have \u2018\u2018imperfect\u2019\u2019\ncancellations and lead to measurable isospin-violating\nbranching ratios. This drives us to investigate the contri-\nbutions from the intermediate meson exchanges to \u0001!\n!\u00020, which is not only an OZI-rule-violating mechanism,\nbut also a source of isospin violations.\nA reasonable approach is that at hadronic level, we study\nthe EM and hadronic loop contributions coherently with\nthe aid of the up-to-date experimental data. It will enable\nus to quantify these two isospin-violating sources with\nsome obvious advantages: (i) At hadronic level, we can\nextract couplings from independent experimental measure-\nments without knowing all the details about the quark\ndistribution functions. This technique has been broadly\napplied to the study of nonperturbative long-range inter-\nactions in the hadronic decays of heavy quarkonia, espe-\ncially in charmonium decays [20\u201324]. (ii) Adopting the\nexperimental constraints on the meson masses and effec-\ntive couplings, we also avoid the details about how the\ndifference of the u\u0005 d quark masses leads to the correc-\ntions to the decay constants.\nIn the next section, we first analyze the EM\u0001 decay in a\nVMD model and then present our intermediate-meson-\nexchange model with effective Lagrangians. The numeri-\ncal results for\u0001! !\u00020 are given in Sec. III. An extension\nof this approach to J= \u0002 0\u0004 ! !\u00020 is also discussed. A\nsummary is then given in Sec. IV.\nII.

[26].\nWith the couplings determined as the above, one can see\nthat a relative sign arises between the amplitudes for the\ncharged and neutral meson exchange loops. We then dis-\ntinguish these two amplitudes as follows:\n Mfi \t Mcfi \u0007Mnfi; (21)\nwhere Mcfi and Mnfi have similar structures except that the\ncouplings and masses involving the intermediate charged\nand neutral mesons are different due to the isospin sym-\nmetry violations. The nonvanishing cancellation thus can\ncontribute to the isospin-violating branching ratios.\nTo proceed, we treat the loop integral in two different\nways. First, we apply an on-shell approximation (Cutkosky\nrule) for the intermediate K \u0001K, which will reduce the loop\nintegration into an integral over the azimuthal angles de-\nfined by p3 relative to p\u0002. This approximation picks up the\nimaginary part of the transition amplitude, and with n \u0006 0,\n1, 2, we can examine the effects from the form factors.\nThere are some disadvantages of this treatment. For inter-\nmediate mesons of which the mass threshold is above the\u0001\nmass, their contributions to the imaginary (absorptive) part\nvanish though their contributions to the real (dispersive)\npart may be sizeable. Because of this, we also consider the\nloop integrals including the dispersive part in a Feynman\nTABLE I. The absolute values of coupling constants for the\nvertex interactions.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA. Branching ratios from EM decay transition\nThe \u0001 meson EM decay turns out to be very sensitive to\nthe \u00030 mass pole and decay width in the VMD model. This\nis because their masses are close to each other. As a test, in\nthe infinitely narrow-width limit, i.e. \u0002\u0003 \u0006 \u0002! \u0006 0 GeV,\nthe branching ratio turns out to be overestimated: BREM \u0006\n1:46\b 10\u00054, which is more than 2 times the experimental\nvalue. This may not be surprising since one should adopt\nthe mass eigenstates in the calculation instead of the iso-\nspin eigenstates in degenerate perturbation theory.\nTherefore, we apply the experimental data for the inter-\nmediate vector meson masses and widths in the\ncalculation.\nWith the width of the \u0003 meson included, we obtain\nBREM \u0006 1:68\b 10\u00055, with M\u0003 \u0006 775:9 MeV and \u0002\u0003 \u0006\n143:9 MeV [13]. With the PDG average, i.e. M\u0003 \u0006\n775:5 MeV and \u0002\u0003 \u0006 149:4 MeV, we have BREM \u0006\n1:67\b 10\u00055. This explicitly shows an important role\nplayed by the \u0003 meson.\nWe also examine the relative strength between process-I\nand II. Their exclusive contributions to the branching ratios\nare BREM\u0005I \u0006 1:45\b 10\u00055 and BREM\u0005II \u0006 4:56\b 10\u00057,\nrespectively, which shows that process-I is dominant over\nII in the \u0001 decay.\nThe above results suggest that the EM transition alone\ncannot account for the observed branching ratio for \u0001!\n!\u00020. We hence need to look at the contributions from the\nintermediate meson exchanges.\nB. Branching ratios from hadronic loop under on-shell\napproximation\nUnder the on-shell approximation only the intermediate\nK \u0001K will contribute since the threshold of any other strange\nmeson pairs will be above the \u0001 mass.\nWithout the form factor, the branching ratio from the\nK \u0001K\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loop is 3:02\b 10\u00056. This number is much smaller\nthan the EM contributions. Apart from the significant\ncancellations between the charged and neutral channel\namplitudes, another reason is because of the kinematic\nsuppression on the absorptive amplitudes, i.e. the inter-\nmediate K \u0001K is close to the\u0001mass. Similar phenomena are\nobserved in J= ! \u0005f0\u00021810\u0004 ! \u0005!\u0001 at the higher mass\ntail of the f0\u00021810\u0004 [27]. At least it is reasonable to under-\nstand that contributions from near-threshold intermediate\nmeson rescattering are limited in the on-shell\napproximation.\nIn order to investigate the role played by the form\nfactors, we present the calculation results in Fig. 3 for\nthree cases: (i) the hadronic loop has a dipole form factor\n(solid curve); (ii) the hadronic loop has a monopole form\nfactor (dashed curve); and (iii) no form factors are included\n(dotted-dashed line). It is easy to understand that under the\non-shell approximation the calculation without the form\nfactors for the hadronic loops will have the largest contri-\nbutions to the branching ratio.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 77, 014010 (2008)\n014010-7\na monopole form factor suppresses the hadronic loop con-\ntributions, and a dipole form factor leads to the most\nsuppressions. These three results then converge to the\nsame value when \u0003 ! 1 as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe overall results in terms of \u0003 including the EM and\nhadronic loop amplitudes are presented in Fig. 4 for two\ndifferent phases, i.e. on the left panel the EM amplitude is\nout of phase to the hadronic loop (destructive addition),\nwhile on the right panel these two amplitudes are in phase\n(constructive addition). On the left panel the horizontal line\nreflects the largest cancellation between the EM and had-\nronic loop amplitudes with no form factor suppressions. At\nthe small \u0003 region, the cancellations are small for both\nmonopole and dipole calculations since the hadronic loop\namplitudes are small in both cases as shown by Fig. 3.\nThese three curves smoothly approach the same value at\nhigh \u0003 where the hadronic loop contributions become\nnegligibly small.\nOn the right panel, the EM amplitude is in phase to the\nhadronic loop. In the case that no form factor is introduced\nin the hadronic loop, the constructive addition of the EM\nand hadronic loop amplitudes gives BR \u0006 2:55\b 10\u00055.\nFor the monopole and dipole form factor, the constructive\neffects increase with parameter \u0003 since the exclusive\nhadronic loop contributions are small in the small \u0003 re-\ngion. It shows by the dashed and solid curve that the\ninclusive branching ratios converge to the dotted-dashed\ncurve at large \u0003. In this constructive addition, the maxi-\nmum branching ratio is still smaller than the experimental\ndata, which is a sign for the underestimate of the hadronic\nloop contributions in the on-shell approximation, and im-\nplies the need for contributions from the dispersive part,\ni.e. from intermediate mesons above the \u0001 mass.\nC. Branching ratios from Feynman integrations\nNote that we are interested in a small effect arising from\ncancellations between two sizeable amplitudes. Since the\ncharged and neutral amplitudes distinguish themselves by\nthe mass differences between the charged and neutral\nparticles involved in the loop transition, it makes the\nbehavior of the cancellations very sensitive to the choice\nof the cutoff energies. Again, it is necessary to investigate\nthe \u0003 dependence of the hadronic loop integrals. We first\nstudy the exclusive behaviors of the K \u0001K\u0002K\u0003\u0004, K \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0004, and\nK \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loops and then combine them with the EM\ntransitions to study their interferences.\nIn Fig. 5, the K \u0001K\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loop in terms of the cutoff energy\n\u0003 is illustrated. The left panel is for a monopole form\nfactor, while the right one is for a dipole type. The dashed\nand dotted-dashed curves are contributions from the\ncharged and neutral meson loop, respectively, and the solid\ncurves are their differences. In fact, the differences be-\ntween the dashed and dotted-dashed curves are so small\nthat it is hard to distinguish them as shown by the figures.\nTheir cancellations leave only a small residue quantity\naccounting for the isospin violation effects.\nThe dependence of the details of the cancellations to the\ncutoff energy turns out to be more dramatic with a dipole\nform factor as shown by the right panel of Fig. 5. Although\nthe integral for both the charged and neutral meson loops\nhas a well-defined behavior, details of the cancellations as\nshown by the solid curve has an oscillatory behavior at\nsmall \u0003. This is understandable since the difference be-\ntween the charged and neutral meson loop integrals has a\ncomplicated dependence on the couplings, and the mass\ndifferences between the charged and neutral kaon and K\u0003\nin the propagators. For large \u0003, the integral difference\nsmooths out since \u0003 becomes the major energy scale.\nIn Fig. 5 there are dips appearing at small \u0003 for both\nmonopole and dipole form factors. This is due to the factor\n\u00032 \u0005m2K\u0003 in the numerators of the form factors and the\nlargest cancellation between the charged and neutral me-\nson loops.\nFor the P-wave \u0001! !\u00020 decay, the form factor favors\na dipole behavior with relatively large \u0003 in order to ac-\ncount for the off-shell effects. Guided by the solid curve on\nthe right panel of Fig. 5, we argue that \u0003 \u2019 1:5\u0001 2 GeV is\nappropriate for the hadronic loop contributions. Also, in\nthis region, the integral difference has a well-defined\nsmooth behavior.

Otherwise, the branching ratio\nwill be overestimated. Because of this ambiguity, we leave\nthe value of \u0003 to be determined by the experimental data.\nThe K \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0004 loop contributions are presented by Fig. 6\nfor the monopole and dipole form factors. Similar to Fig. 5,\nthe intermediate charged and neutral meson loop contribu-\ntions to the branching ratios are compared with each other\nas denoted by the dashed and dotted-dashed curves, while\nthe solid curves are given by their amplitude differences.\nInterestingly, the K \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0004 loop contributions turn out to\nexhibit a smooth behavior with both monopole and dipole\nform factors, and their magnitudes are comparable with the\nK \u0001K\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loop. Again, the dips are related to the factor \u00032 \u0005\nm2K in the numerator of the form factors and the largest\ncancellation between the charged and neutral meson loops.\nIn Fig. 7, the \u0003 dependence of the exclusive contribu-\ntions from the K \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loop are presented. Compared\nwith the other two loops, the exclusive branching ratio\ndecreases in terms of the increasing \u0003. As a result, its\ninterferences with other channels around \u0003 \u0006 1:5\u0001\n2:0 GeV turn to be small.\nAdding the hadronic loops to the EM amplitude coher-\nently, we examine two phases in Fig. 8 in terms of the \u0003,\ni.e. constructive (left panel) and destructive additions (right\npanel). It shows that with \u0003 \u0006 1:8\u0001 2:3 GeV, the con-\nstructive addition with the dipole form factor for the had-\nronic loops gives the branching ratio in agreement with the\nexperimental data, while with the monopole form factor, \u0003\nrequires a range of 1:2\u0001 1:5 GeV. These cutoff energy\nranges are consistent with the commonly accepted values.\nFor a destructive addition between the EM and hadronic\nloop amplitudes as shown on the right panel, we find that\nthe dipole form factor cannot reproduce the data within\n\u0003 \u0006 1\u0001 2:6 GeV due to the significant cancellations be-\ntween the EM and hadronic loop transitions.

SUMMARY\nWe investigate the isospin-violating mechanisms in\n\u0001! !\u00020 and J= ! !\u00020 by quantifying the EM and\nstrong transitions as different sources of the isospin viola-\ntions. The EM contribution is constrained in the VMD\nmodel, and the hadronic loop contributions is studied by\nrelating them to the OZI-rule-violating processes. At had-\nronic level, the OZI rule violations are recognized through\nthe nonvanishing cancellations between the charged and\nneutral intermediate-meson-exchange loops. In other\nwords, the observation of the isospin-violating branching\nratios can be viewed as a consequence of coherent contri-\nbutions from the EM transitions and the nonvanishing\ncancellations among those intermediate meson exchanges\ndue to the mass differences between the charged and\nneutral intermediate mesons and different couplings to\nthe initial and final state mesons.\nBy extracting the vertex coupling information from\nindependent processes, we can constrain the model pa-\nrameters and make a quantitative assessment of the strong\nisospin violations via leading K \u0001K\u0002K\u0003\u0004, K \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0004, and\nK \u0001K\u0003\u0002K\u0003\u0004 loops. It shows that the dispersive part of the\nhadronic loop amplitudes have important contributions to\nthe isospin violation and they produce crucial interferences\nwith the EM transitions though their exclusive contribu-\ntions are relatively smaller than the EM ones in \u0001! !\u00020\ndecay.\nWe also study the hadronic loop contributions to the\nisospin-violating decay of J= \u0002 0\u0004 ! !\u00020, and find that\nthey are negligibly small. This is consistent with our\nprevious study of the EM transitions in J= \u0002 0\u0004 ! VP,\nwhere we argued that the isospin-violating channels, such\nas !\u00020, \u0003\u0004, \u0003\u00040, and \u0001\u00020, were dominated by the EM\ntransitions [11,12]. However, a caution should be given\nthat in J= \u0002 0\u0004 ! VP the s dependence of the intermediate\nvector meson widths turns out to be a sensitive factor in\naccount of contributions from light intermediate vector\nmesons. A coherent study of e\u0007e\u0005 ! !\u00020 over a broad\nrange of s is thus strongly desired.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nG. Li would like to thank Y. L. Shen and W. Wang for\nuseful discussions.
