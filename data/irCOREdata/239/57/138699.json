The predominant routes\nof entry arising from diffuse applications of pesticide include spray drift, surface runoff and\nleaching to field drains. Systems of regulation for pesticides prior to approval for use include\na demonstration that unacceptable risk will not be posed to the aquatic environment. An\nassessment is undertaken which often uses models to predict concentrations of a particular\ncompound in different water bodies and combines this with ecotoxicological information to\nderive a measure of risk.\nThe environmental fate of pesticides is influenced by a large number of factors including the\ninherent properties of the chemical, the timing and pattern of use of the product, the behaviour\nof the farmer and the performance of farm equipment. Fate is also determined by a range of\nenvironmental parameters related to soils, hydrogeology, topography, crop physiology,\nweather and irrigation. Given the complexity of these interacting factors, the most common\napproach to modelling fate has been to derive a limited number of environmental scenarios\nwhich are then used as the basis for predicting the behaviour of individual pesticides and\ncomparing between different compounds. A standardised modelling approach for the\ncalculation of exposure of surface waters in Europe has recently been established by FOCUS\n(2003). A modelling tool was developed which combines mechanistic models with 10\nstandard environmental scenarios selected to represent the European agricultural area. The\napproach is designed to produce a generalised expression of exposure whose conservatism\nderives from worst-case assumptions built into the calculation. For example, the FOCUS tool\nassumes that water bodies adjacent to agricultural land are either ditches, streams or ponds\nand that each of these categories can be described with a single set of dimensions throughout\nEurope. Thus the FOCUS stream is 1 m in width, 0.3 to 0.5 m in depth, 100 m in length and\nhas an average residence time of 0.1 day; there is a 5 cm layer of sediment at the base which\nhas 5% organic carbon; the stream is situated 1 m away from a 1 ha treated field; and it\nreceives water and pesticide from a 100 ha upstream catchment which has the same\ncharacteristics as the treated field, but only 20 ha are treated with pesticide (FOCUS, 2003).\nPredictive modelling based on scenarios has several advantages in that it is relatively simple\nand quick to undertake, there is a high degree of standardisation between chemicals and,\nprovided scenarios are appropriately defined, the approach can provide a conservative\nassessment of exposure and thus a high level of environmental protection. Unfortunately, as\nthere are many interacting factors, it is not usually possible to quantify the likely level of\nconservatism. For example, it is not simple to quantify the likely impact on exposure and\necological effects of a stream which is shallower (i.e. less immediate dilution potential) but\nfaster running (i.e. greater advective losses from the system) than the standard scenario.\nIn practice, there is a sparcity of readily-available data on the properties of aquatic habitats.\nThis creates two problems. First, the definition of assessment scenarios becomes a rather\nsubjective process which is not underpinned by detailed analysis of the true range of\nenvironmental conditions. There is a tendency to introduce overly protective assumptions in\nthe absence of detailed information, but it is very difficult to assess the realism of the scenario\nand the degree of protection afforded. Secondly, there is no solid basis on which to proceed\nto more realistic assessments of exposure.\nA number of workers have reported predictions of the spatial and temporal variation in\npesticide concentrations at the watershed level (Bach et al., 2001; Cryer et al., 2001;\nDabrowski et al., 2002; Verro et al., 2002). The approaches combine mathematical models\nwith a geographical information system and address the variation in exposure arising from\ndifferences in soil type, topography, land use and climate. Variability in the properties of the\nreceiving water bodies cannot be considerd at this scale. There have also been significant\nadvances in using remote or aerial imaging technologies to investigate the way that\nagriculture interacts with the landscape (Hendley et al., 2001; Padovani et al., 2004). These\ngenerally consider a specific location and have tended to concentrate on determining\nproximity and density of arable cropping adjacent to water bodies. Information on a broader\nrange of properties of water bodies is collected in surveys by groups from government, nature\nconservation agencies and the research community. However, the surveys are often only\nreported within the grey literature and the resulting databases are disparate in terms of format,\nparameters held and physical location.\nIn this paper, data from major national freshwater datasets in Britain are used to present an\ninitial characterisation of the physico-chemical and morphological properties of aquatic\nhabitats in the agricultural landscape. A hydrogeological classification of landscape is used to\ngroup water bodies into broadly similar types and to allow comparison between landscapes.\nBiological data from these habitats are presented in an accompanying paper (Biggs et al.,\n200x).\n2 Methods\n2.1 Derivation of landscape classes\nWorking definitions were developed for the four waterbody types included within the\nanalysis: ditches, ponds, streams and rivers (Table 1). Definitions were based on hydrological,\nmorphological and biological criteria, particularly considering: (i) the range of existing\ndefinitions in common usage; (ii) practical constraints imposed by pre-existing datasets\nanalysed for the study; and (iii) criteria that could be derived or calculated from Ordnance\nSurvey maps.\nLandscape classes were defined to capture broad differences in types, properties and\nabundance of waterbodies, potential for exposure to pesticides (i.e. agricultural land use) and\nroutes of movement of water (and thus potentially pesticide) from agricultural fields to water.\nFirst, the extent to which hydrogeology, soils, topography and cropping patterns co-vary\nacross the landscape was assessed visually using the legend attributes from the 1:250,000 soil\nmaps of England, Wales and Scotland (Mackney et al., 1983; MISR, 1984). Next,\ndescriptions of landscapes were set out using broad types of soil parent material as a link\nbetween topography and hydrogeology (expressed as the likelihood of presence of different\ntypes of waterbody) and including elements of a classification of soil types according to their\nhydrological response (Lilly et al., 1998). A digital dataset was generated using the national\nsoil maps of England and Wales and of Scotland (both polygon datasets at scales of\n1:250,000). Non-agricultural areas (defined as those unlikely to receive significant\nagricultural inputs of pesticide) were identified by combining urban and inland water\npolygons with all soil association map units with no significant agricultural usage given on\nthe map legend. All remaining soil associations were assigned to one of 12 agricultural\nlandscape classes using soil parent material as the classifier. Digitised boundaries for\nlandscape classes were generated from soil association linework. The resulting map was\nrather fragmented where soil parent material is locally heterogeneous. A smoothed map was\ngenerated by merging small polygons wholly contained within larger polygons and by\nremoving long, thin polygons with a resolution of ca. 500 m.\n2.2 Data collection and processing\n2.2.1 Abundance of water bodies\nThe spatial abundance of waterbody types was described using a variety of datasets. The\nlength of river within each landscape class was estimated using the ESRI ArcView GIS\nsoftware. Two databases were used: (i) the polygon shape data file for the aquatic landscape\nclasses; and (ii) the line layer \u2018River\u2019 data files from the Ordnance Survey \u201cSTRATEGI\u201d\ndataset. The six river line layer files were updated to create a single river line file which was\nthen clipped within each of the polygons for the landscape classes to produce a separate shape\nfile for each landscape class. Each of these shape files was then converted to an arc coverage\nand the length queried to derive an accurate river length estimate within each landscape class.\nFor streams, ditches and ponds, data were derived from the Countryside Survey 2000\n(Firbank et al., 2003). The 569 squares (each 1 km2) of the Countryside Survey were\nreclassified into the 13 landscape classes. The mean length of ditch and stream per km2 and\nthe mean density of ponds per km2 was calculated for each class.\n2.2.2 Morphological and physico-chemical properties of water bodies\nPre-existing datasets were accessed and merged where possible to describe the morphological\nand physico-chemical properties of the different waterbodies (Table 2). Datasets were filtered\nto exclude monitoring sites potentially impacted from urban or industrial situations. For each\nof the available datasets, the physico-chemical and morphological features of waterbody types\nwere described for each agricultural landscape class. This included, where available,\nassessment of values for attributes relevant to pesticide risk assessment (e.g. waterbody size,\nmorphology, flow characteristics, pH, permanence, sediment characteristics, abundance of\naquatic vegetation, bankside vegetation, distance to crop) and ecosystem driving variables\n(e.g. nutrient status, substrate composition). Categorical data were summarised as proportion\nof sites falling into specific categories. All numeric data were described by mean, median,\nstandard deviation and range.\nAdditional field data were collected to address a lack of adequate information describing\nditches in agricultural landscapes. New ditch data were gathered within a 10 x 10 km area at\nfour field study sites in contrasting agricultural landscapes. The sites and grid reference of the\nnorth-west corner of the experimental area were: Spalding, Lincolnshire (LC2; ****),\nMorpeth, Northumberland (LC4; ****), Whitchurch, Cheshire (LC5; ****), and Kington, ***\n(LC7; ****). From each area, physico-chemical field data were collected from 10 randomly\nlocated ditch sites including ****. Need grid references and further details of ditch survey\nwork\n2.2.2 Land use and potential for exposure to pesticides\nA spatial dataset for agricultural land had previously been produced by combining\nAgricultural Census data for Great Britain for 1995\n(http:\/\/datalib.ed.ac.uk\/EUDL\/agriculture\/) with a remotely-sensed Land Cover Map of Great\nBritain (Fuller et al., 1994). This dataset was overlaid onto the spatial dataset for landscape\nclasses to identify cropping patterns in the different landscapes. Cropping varies significantly\non an east to west axis across England and Wales, so regional analyses based on the eight\nEnvironment Agency regions were also undertaken.\nField size \u2013 need methodology for this\nThe distance between a water body and the nearest cropped land receiving inputs of pesticides\nis a key determinand for potential exposure, especially for the more localised transport\nprocesses such as spray drift. Many of the datasets contained fields descriptors for land use\nadjacent to water bodies, although the actual measure varied greatly. The area extending\n50 m from rivers and streams was characterised as to whether different land uses were\n\u2018absent\u2019, \u2018present\u2019 or \u2018extensive\u2019. The proportion of different land uses was measured for a 5\nand 100 m radius around ponds. Ditches are the most intimately associated with agriculture\nand here the distance to the nearest arable field was available. The data were collated to give\na crude comparison of the density of arable cultivation around water bodies in the different\nlandscapes.\nThe average input of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides per unit area of each landscape\n(i.e. averaged over the whole area including non-agricultural) was calculated from the land\nuse information and statistics from pesticide usage surveys for the various crops (Reference).\n2.2.3 Database construction\nA relational database was constructed as a repository for the processed (aggregated) data on\nthe properties of the landscape classes. Data tables were imported into a single MS Access\ndatabase comprising 22 tables. A graphical user interface (GUI) was written in Visual Basic\nto allow users to display information, interrogate the database and extract data from the\ndatabase into comma separated value files. Within the GUI, the ESRI MapObjectsLT\nsoftware library was used to enable the display and interrogation of the map of landscape\nclasses. The database and GUI are Windows-based software designed for use with either\nWindows 2000 or Windows XP platforms. The database is available for free download at:\nftp:\/\/ftp.silsoe.cranfield.ac.uk\/public\/aquatic\/.\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nStatistical tests used for hypothesis testing were performed using the statistical software\nprogram Statistica, version 6.1 (Tulsa, OK). The exception was for \u03c72 tests, which were\ncalculated longhand using significance tables given by Kanji (1999). Differences between\nsample means were analysed using t-tests or 1-way ANOVA, with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests\nused to identify significantly different sample means. Where data were non-normal\n(determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality) or the variances of the sample\ndata differed significantly (determined by F-tests), non-parametric methods were used to look\nfor differences between sample medians. Kruskall-Wallis tests were used as an equivalent to\none-way ANOVA, with post-hoc testing performed using Mann-Whitney U-tests. Correlation\nanalysis between non-normal datasets was performed using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation.\nDifferences between distributions were assessed using \u03c72 tests. Statistical tests were\nconsidered significant at the 95% level (p < 0.05), and these probability levels are implied\nunless otherwise stated. As the distinction between streams and rivers is operational, these\ntwo types of waterbody were not differentiated for any of the chemical and morphological\nanalyses.\n2.3.1 Waterbody morphology\nRiver and stream (combined) water width and depth measurements were analysed to assess\nwhether morphological differences existed between landscape classes. As the datasets for\neach landscape class were strongly skewed towards zero (determined using Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov normality tests), non-parametric statistics were used. Where significance (p < 0.05)\nwas found following Kruskall-Wallis tests, landscape classes were ordered according to width\nor depth rankings, and pair-wise comparisons made between landscape classes using Mann-\nWhitney U-tests.\nAs raw width and depth data were identified for each sample site, it was possible to perform\ncorrelation analysis between these data using Spearman\u2019s ranked correlation test. Where\nsignificant (P < 0.05) correlation between width and depth was demonstrated for a landscape\nclass, determination of a cross-sectional shape parameter (depth \/ width \u00d7 100) for each\nlandscape class could be justified. Large values for this parameter indicate a deep, narrow\nwater body. Differences between medians for each landscape class were determined as for\nwidth and depth.\nPond surface area and average depth measurements were statistically analysed to determine\nwhether morphological differences existed between landscape classes. Surface area and depth\nwere correlated using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation, and medians of pond volume (surface area\n\u00d7 depth) were analysed using a Kruskall-Wallis test.\nDitch width measurements were statistically analysed for differences between waterbodies.\nAs the raw data were categorical, a \u03c72 test was used to look for differences in category\ndistribution between landscape classes.\n2.3.2 Bed substrata of rivers and streams\nDetailed information on stream\/river-bed material was analysed to look for differences in\ndistributions of bed material between landscape classes.\n2.3.3 Waterbody chemistry\nWater chemistry data for streams and rivers (combined), ponds and ditches were analysed for\ndifferences between landscape classes (within waterbody groups), and differences between\nwaterbody types using one-way ANOVA tests. Comparisons between all waterbody types are\npresented for pH and conductivity.\n3 Results\n3.1 Identification of landscape classes potentially exposed to\npesticides\nA total of 12 agricultural landscape classes was identified for England, Scotland and Wales,\nwith a thirteenth class comprising all non-agricultural land (including urban, forestry, non-\nmaintained grassland and amenity uses). Table 3 summarises the properties of the classes and\ntheir spatial distribution is shown in Figure 1. The number of sampling sites for each\nwaterbody in each landscape class is shown in Table 4. Physico-chemical data relating to the\nspecific Scottish landscape classes (11 and 12) are limited and these classes are not\nconsidered further within this study. However, these classes are included within an\naccompanying analysis of the biology of freshwater habitats (Biggs et al., 200x). Many of the\nother landscape classes are also present in Scotland.\n3.2 Abundance of water bodies\nRelative distributions of rivers, streams, and non-road ditches (defined as average length of\nwaterbody (m) per km2) and the number of ponds per unit area are shown in Figure 2. The\nfrequency distribution of rivers, streams and ditches was shown to be highly significant using\na \u03c72 test (\u03c72 test = 7044 > \u03c72 critical (p = 0.05) = 31.5; 18 degrees of freedom). The greatest contributor\nto the large \u03c72 value was from Landscape 1 (floodplains) which explained 34.8% of the\noverall difference between observed and expected values. Landscape 1 is by definition the\nmost dominated by rivers, whereas streams are more evenly distributed amongst the\nlandscapes. Streams and rivers are least abundant in chalk and limestone areas. Ditches are\nthe dominant feature in landscapes 2 and 6 (fenlands and clay areas) and they are also\nparticularly numerous in non-agricultural areas, presumably in parts that are too wet to\nsupport agriculture. The number of ponds per unit area varied six-fold between landscape 5\n(low base tills) and landscape 6 (clays). Average pond size varied between 0.07 and 0.37 ha,\nwith the largest ponds in landscape 10 (hard rock).\nData from Countryside Surveys undertaken in 1990 and 2000 indicate that the area of\nstreams, rivers, ditches and lakes did not change significantly during this period. There was a\nsmall increase in pond numbers during this time, reversing a long period of decline over the\nprevious 50 years (Haines-Young et al. 2000).\n3.3 Land-use and potential for exposure to pesticides\nAgricultural land-use across the 11 landscape classes is shown in Table 5 alongside average\nfield sizes for the different landscapes. A simplified characterisation of land-use is provided\nin Figure 3. Field size is closely related to land use. A correlation analysis indicated a positive\ncorrelation between field size and proportion of land under arable cultivation (Spearman\u2019s\nR=0.915; p<0.05).\nFigure 4 shows the different measures for extent of arable cultivation around water bodies.\nResults for rivers and streams were almost identical, with only slightly denser arable land use\naround streams compared to rivers; these two datasets were thus combined. Across all\nlandscapes, arable land use was \u2018present\u2019 or \u2018extensive\u2019 within 50 m of the river or stream for\nless than 50% of the sites surveyed. Arable cultivation tended to be either \u2018absent\u2019 or\n\u2018extensive\u2019 with few sites categorised at the intermediate level of arable land use \u2018present\u2019.\nThe land use around rivers and streams followed that in the broader landscape with the\ngreatest amount of arable land in landscapes 2, 4 and 7 (cf. Figure 3). Other land uses such as\norchards which receive inputs of pesticides accounted for less than 1% of land within 50 m of\nrivers and streams.\nArable fields were almost never located within 5 m of ponds, with the greatest exception\nbeing in landscape 4 (eutrophic tills) where surface-fed ponds within fields are a feature of the\nlandscape. There was large variability in the amount of arable cultivation within 100 m of\nponds, but on average this accounted for between 1 and 27% of the area for the different\nlandscapes. Ditches tend to be intimately related with agricultural production. The average\ndistance to an arable field was in the range 1.5 to 3.2 m, although the survey size was very\nlimited.\nInformation on cropping patterns can be used with knowledge of any geographical or soil-\nrelated factors influencing use of a pesticide to estimate the variation in use within the\ndifferent landscapes. Table 6 provides the average input of different types of pesticide to\ndifferent landscapes as derived from pesticide usage statistics (reference). Landscape 2\n(fenlands and warplands) receives the highest loading of pesticides because it is largely\nintensive arable land and several crops receiving high inputs of pesticide (e.g. sugar beet and\npotatoes) are widely cultivated. There is almost an order of magnitude difference in the total\ninput of pesticide per unit area between the different landscapes.\n3.4 Waterbody characteristics\nAnalyses are presented for those chemical and morphological characteristics of waterbodies\nin the British agricultural landscape which have a bearing on the ecological risk from\npesticides. The datasets are not equally extensive across all landscape classes for all\nparameters and for all water bodies. Therefore, data are presented only for landscape classes\nsufficiently represented (determined as sample sites > 10). For ditch data, where surveys were\nrelatively constrained, coverage across the range of landscape classes is especially limited.\nLandscapes 11 and 12 (specific to Scotland) are not included in these results (therefore, a total\nof 11 landscape classes are considered). Note that other landscape classes are inclusive of\nScotland (see Figure 1).\n3.4.1 Waterbody morphology\nStreams and rivers\nKolmogorov-Smirnov normality tests were performed on width and depth data for all\nlandscape classes. For both datasets, all the data distributions differed significantly (p < 0.01)\nfrom the normal distribution. Kruskall-Wallis tests identified significant differences in median\nvalues between landscape classes for width data (H(N = 8942) = 1626; p < 0.001) and for depth\ndata (H(N = 8911) = 1253; p < 0.001), enabling the classes to be ranked. Mann-Whitney U-tests\nwere then used to differentiate individual landscape class medians. The relative rankings,\nmedian values and sample numbers are shown in Figures 5a and 5b. Landscapes 1\n(floodplains), 2 (warplands \/ fenlands) and 3 (sandlands) include some of the widest and\ndeepest streams and rivers, with landscapes 6 (clays) and 8 (loams) containing some of the\nnarrowest and shallowest.\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis was performed for width versus depth at each sample\nsite, and in each landscape class. There was a highly significant (p < 0.001) correlation\nbetween width and depth for all landscape classes. It is thus reasonable to consider a river-bed\nshape parameter (S) defined as:\nS = depth (m) \/ width (m) \u00d7 100\nThese data were analysed as for width and depth. Kruskall-Wallis tests identified significant\ndifferences in median values between landscape classes for steepness data (H(N = 8906, d.f. = 10) =\n460, p < 0.001), and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to differentiate individual landscape\nclass medians as before. The relative rankings, median values and sample numbers are shown\nin Figure 5c. Landscape 2 (warplands \/ fenlands) showed the greatest depth:width ratio, with\nlandscapes 9 (rock & clay) and 5 (oligotrophic till) the shallowest. This analysis clearly\nseparates landscape 2 from landscapes 1 and 3. The shape parameter is likely to be correlated\nwith topography with larger values for S in the flatter landscapes such as that of the\nwarplands and fenlands.\nPonds\nKolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normality showed pond volume data to be significantly\ndifferent from the normal distribution (p < 0.01) for all landscape classes with the exception\nof landscape class 2 which had a small sample size (n = 11). A Kruskall-Wallis test showed\nno overall significant difference in pond volume between landscape classes (H (N = 271, d.f. = 9) =\n8.35, p < 0.001). Mean pond volume varied between 461 and 3528 m3 in sandland and hard\nrock landscapes, respectively.\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation was performed for surface area versus average depth data for\neach landscape class. There was no significant correlation between pond surface area and\ndepth for any landscape class apart fron LC7 (chalk & limestone plateaux; R = 0.58, p =\n0.008).\nDitches\nThe dataset for ditch width had a limited spread across the landscape classes, with only four\nlandscape classes sufficiently represented in the data (n > 9). Figure 6 shows the distribution\nof width categories between these four landscape classes (raw data for ditch width were\ncategorical). A \u03c72 analysis was performed to determine whether differences in width\ndistributions between landscape classes were significant. The four categories shown in Figure\n9 were combined into two groups for the analysis: 0 to 3 m and over 3 m. The frequency\ndistribution of ditch width between landscape classes was shown to be significant\n(\u03c72 test = 17.7 > \u03c72critical (p = 0.05) = 9.95; 3 degrees of freedom). The biggest difference between\nobserved and expected values (79.6% of overall difference) lies with landscape class 1\n(floodplains), where more ditches fall within the narrower width category than for the other\nlandscape classes.\n3.4.3 Bed substrata of rivers and streams\nThe distribution of stream \/ river bed material types across landscape classes is shown in\nFigure 7. A \u03c72 analysis showed that differences in bed material between landscape classes\nwere highly significant (\u03c72 test = 3069 > \u03c72critical (p = 0.05) = 83; 60 degrees of freedom). The\nbiggest difference between observed and expected values (27% of overall difference) lies\nwith landscape 2 (warplands \/ fenlands), where a high proportion (64%) of bed material is silt\nor mud.\n3.4.4 Waterbody chemistry:\nThe mean values for pH and conductivity (showing associated error) for each waterbody are\nshown in Figures 8 and 9 for all landscape classes considered. Comparisons for streams and\nrivers were made for landscape classes 1, 2, 3, 10 and 13 only. One-way ANOVA on six key\nchemical determinants showed that there were no significant differences between landscape\nclasses for conductivity, or for concentrations of suspended solids and Na. There were,\nhowever, significant difference for pH (F = 14.9; n = 167; p < 0.001), nitrite concentration (F\n= 5.6; n = 164; p < 0.001) and nitrate concentration (F = 7.0; n = 167; p < 0.001). Tukey\u2019s\nHSD post-hoc test for pair-wise comparisons between landscape classes for pH showed that\nthe only significant individual difference between landscape classes was for landscape class\n10 (hard rock), where mean pH was lower than for the other classes (pH = 7.1; see Figure 11).\nComparisons for ponds were made for pH, conductivity and Na concentration between all\nlandscape classes except class 5 (insufficient data). One-way ANOVA showed that there were\nsignificant differences between landscape classes for pH (F = 4.6; n = 240; p < 0.001),\nconductivity (F = 6.5; n = 253; p < 0.001) and Na concentration (F = 3.0; n = 241; p = 0.002).\nHowever, there was no overall significant difference for pH when LC 13 (non-agricultural)\nwas excluded from the analysis. The mean pH of 6.4 for LC13 was considerably lower than\nfor the other classes. Tukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc test for pair-wise comparisons between\nlandscape classes for conductivity showed that landscape class 13 (non-agricultural; lowest\nconductivity, 224 \u03bcs cm-1) could be separated from classes 4, 3, 6 and 7 at the 95%\nsignificance level; landscape class 10 (hard rock; 252 \u03bcs cm-1) could be separated from 2 and\n4, and landscape 8 (loam; 299 \u03bcs cm-1) could be separated from class 2. Landscape class 2\n(warplands \/ fenlands) had the highest conductivity (769 \u03bcs cm-1).\nComparisons for pH and conductivity of ditches were restricted to landscape classes 2, 4, 5\nand 8. One-way ANOVA analysis showed that there were significant differences between\nlandscape classes for pH (F = 3.4; n = 47; p = 0.027) and conductivity (F = 27.6; n = 46; p <\n0.001). Tukey\u2019s HSD tests for pair-wise comparisons between landscape classes for pH\nshowed that, although the ANOVA result for all landscape classes was significant, there were\nno individual landscape class pairs that were significantly different. It should be noted that\nTukey\u2019s HSD is more conservative than a Student\u2019s t-test. The same pair-wise test applied to\nconductivity showed that landscape class 2 (warplands \/ fenlands) was significantly different\n(p < 0.001) from the other three landscape classes.\nAlthough water pH varied significantly between landscape classes for all four water bodies,\nabsolute differences in mean pH were relatively small. Mean pH varied by less than one unit\nacross the different landscape for any single water body and by 1.5 pH units across\nlandscapes and different water bodies. In general, the pH of ponds was lower than that of\nrivers, streams and ditches.\n4. Discussion\nFor risk assessment to function correctly, it is essential that screening analyses are\nappropriately selected in order to distinguish low, intermediate and high risk situations and\nprioritise issues requiring more complex investigation. Preliminary assessment of exposure\nof aquatic ecosystems to pesticides in Europe relies on standard modelling scenarios\n(FOCUS, 2003). The data presented in this paper can be used to evaluate the scenarios for the\nareas considered. For example, British streams are generally wider than assumed in the\nstandard scenarios (1 m) but are somewhat shallower than the assumption (0.3 m). There are\ntwo landscapes (clays and loams) where stream volume is on average smaller than the\nregulatory scenario, leading to a lesser potential for dilution of any pesticide loadings. The\nFOCUS scenarios assume that ponds exposed to pesticides have a total volume of 900 m3.\nThis is within the range of mean values for the twelve agricultural landscapes (461-1794 m3),\nbut average volumes are smaller in four of the landscapes (fenlands, sandlands, eutrophic tills\nand loam landscapes).\nOf the waterbodies examined, ditches were the most intimately related with agricultural land\nand ponds were the least. The regulatory scenarios assume that waterbodies are surrounded\nby agricultural land with only a 1- or 3-m margin to the nearest arable crop for\nditches\/streams and ponds, respectively. This assumption significantly overestimates the true\nproximity between water and crop. This is important because proximity influences both the\nlevel of contamination of water by pesticides and the potential for recovery of an impacted\npopulation through recolonisation from unaffected stretches of water. Impacts of pesticides\non organisms in ponds may cause particular concern because of the relative isolation of these\nsystems and the reduced potential for rapid recolonisation and recovery. However, data\nclearly show that most ponds are not directly proximate to arable land and that potential for\ndirect impacts from pesticides in Britain is likely to be over-stated by current risk\nassessments.\nDirect comparison of measured data with current assessment scenarios can help to place the\nassumptions into context. However, there is a need to compare exposure calculated using\nstandard scenarios with the distribution of concentrations that results from considering the\ndistribution of environmental conditions. Examples of such comparisons have been reported\nby Travis and Hendley (2001) and Brown et al. (2003) for the aquatic compartment and by\nHart (2003) for birds. In each case, the screening-level estimate of pesticide exposure lay\nwithin the upper 5% of the distribution of exposure obtained using the range of measured data\nas input. Further work of this kind will help to quantify the level of protection afforded by\nscreening assessments and ensure that modelling assumptions are appropriately selected.\nThe risk assessment carried out for non-target aquatic organisms is predominantly\ndeterministic, taking single point estimates for both toxicity and exposure. The exposure\nvalue is often based on a point from a distribution so that, for example, deposition from spray\ndrift is selected as the 90th percentile value from a database of measurements. The\ndeterministic expression of risk is coupled with arbitrary safety factors and leads to a\nqualitative final output which tends to describe the risk in terms of \u2018margin of safety\u2019,\n\u2018adequate protection\u2019 or by reference to a higher tier study or studies. Such assessments do\nnot provide an indication as to the magnitude or frequency of effects or to the level of\ncertainty associated with the risk analysis. There is increasing interest in the use of\nprobabilistic techniques within risk assessment for pesticides (Hart, 2001). These approaches\nexplicitly quantify variability and uncertainty in the assessment and produce outputs with\nmore ecological meaning, such as the probability and magnitude of effects. The analysis of\ninformation presented here is suitable for inclusion within probabilistic modelling of exposure\nwith summary statistics to support definition of probability distribution functions or the\npotential to sample directly from the raw data. Inclusion of correlation between input\nparameters is an important consideration within probabilistic risk assessment (e.g. Cullen and\nFrey, 1998). To some extent the issue is reduced by the grouping of waterbodies into\nrelatively homogeneous landscape classes. Relationships between parameters can be\nincorporated through detailed correlation analysis or by sampling individual water bodies into\nthe analysis.\nEU legislation on pesticides dictates that registration is only possible where \u201cno unacceptable\neffects\u201d on non-target aquatic organisms are expected to occur (EC, 1991). However, the\nDirective stops short of defining \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d effects (Anon, 2002), even\nthough a clear understanding of the protection target is a prerequisite for well-founded risk\nassessment (ref). One way to formalise this will be through the definition of reference images\nwhich describe the water bodies and their associated species assemblages which are to be\nconsidered in risk assessment (Giddings et al., 2002). Definition of reference images needs to\nbe based on knowledge of regional variation in structure and function of aquatic ecosystems.\nCoupled with the analysis of the biota of British waterbodies described by Biggs et al. (200x),\nthe data presented will help to inform the debate on what it is that we are trying to protect.\nReferences\nAnon (2002). Guidance document on aquatic ecotoxicology.
