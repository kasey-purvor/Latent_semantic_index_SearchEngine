Introduction 24 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n2 \nA two-component cold standby system is composed of a primary component and a backup 25 \ncomponent, where the backup component is only called upon when the primary component fails. Cold 26 \nstandby systems are commonly used for non-critical applications. However, cold standby systems are 27 \none of most important structures in the reliability engineering and have been widely applied in reality. 28 \nAn example of such a system is the data backup system in computer networks.  29 \nThe reliability analysis and maintenance policy optimisation for cold standby systems has attracted 30 \nattentions from many researchers. Zhang and Wang (2006, 2007) and Zhang et al (2006) derived the 31 \nexpected long run cost per unit time for a repairable system consisting of two identical components and 32 \none repairman when a geometric process for working times is assumed or for cold standby systems. 33 \nUtkin (2003) proposed imprecise reliability models of cold standby systems when he assumed that 34 \narbitrary probability distributions of the component time to failure are possible and they are restricted 35 \nonly by available information in the form of lower and upper probabilities of some events. Coit (2001) 36 \ndescribed a solution methodology to optimal design configurations for non-repairable series\u2013parallel 37 \nsystems with cold-standby redundancy when he assumed non-constant component hazard functions and 38 \nimperfect switching.  Yu et al. (2007) considers a framework to optimally design a maintainable 39 \nprevious term cold-stand by next term system, and determine the maintenance policy and the reliability 40 \ncharacter of the components.       41 \nDue to various reasons, repair might start immediately after a component fails. In some scenarios, 42 \nfrom the failure of a component to the completion of repair, there might be two periods: waiting time 43 \nand real repair time. The waiting time starts from the failure of the component to the start of repair; and 44 \nthe real repair time is the time between the start to repair and the completion of the repair. This is 45 \nespecially true for cold standby systems as they are not critical enough for a standby repairman be 46 \nequipped for it. For example, when a component fails to work, its owner will call its contracted 47 \nmaintenance company or return the component to its suppler for repair. After a time period, which can 48 \nbe the time spent by repairmen from their working place to the place where the component fails, or the 49 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n3 \ntime on delivering the failed component to its supplier. This time period is called waiting time in what 50 \nfollows. Usually, the waiting time can be seen as a random variable independent of the age of the 51 \ncomponent, whereas the real repair time can become longer and longer when the component becomes 52 \nolder. On the other hand, the working time of the component can become shorter and shorter due to 53 \nvarious reasons such as ageing, and deterioration. Such working time patterns and real repair time 54 \npatterns can be depicted by geometric processes as many authors have studied (Lam 1988).  55 \nThe geometric processes introduced by Lam (1988) define an alternative to the non-homogeneous 56 \nPoisson processes: a sequence of random variables {Xk, k=1,2,...} is a geometric process if the 57 \ndistribution function of Xk is given by F(ak-1t) for k=1,2,... and a is a positive constant. Wang and Pham 58 \n(1996) later refer the geometric process as a quasi-renewal process. Finkelstein (Finkelstein 1993) 59 \ndevelops a very similar model: he defines a general deteriorating renewal process such that Fk+1(t) \u2264 60 \nFk(t). Wu and Clements-Croome (2006) extend the geometric process by replacing its parameter ak-1 61 \nwith a1ak-1+ b1bk-1, where a>1 and 0<b<1. The geometric process has been applied in reliability analysis 62 \nand maintenance policy optimisation for various systems by many authors; for example, see Wang, 63 \nPham (1996), and Wu and Clements-Croome (2005). 64 \nThis paper presents the formulations of the expected long-run cost per unit time for a cold standby 65 \nsystem that consists of two identical components with perfect switching. When a component fails, a 66 \nrepairman will be called in to bring the component back to a certain state. The time to repair is 67 \ncomposed of two different time periods: waiting time and real repair time. The waiting time starts from 68 \nthe component failure to the start to repair, and the real repair time is the time between the start to repair 69 \nand the completion of the repair. Both the working times and real repair times are assumed to be a type 70 \nof stochastic processes: geometric processes, and the waiting time is assumed to be a renewal process. 71 \nWe also assume that the time to repair can either include only real repair time with a probability p, or 72 \ninclude waiting time and real repair time with a probability 1-p. The expected long-run cost per unit time 73 \nis derived and a numerical example is given to demonstrate the usefulness of the derived expression. 74 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n4 \nThe paper is structured as follows. The coming section introduces geometric processes defined by 75 \nLam (1988), denotation and assumptions. Section 3 discusses special cases. Section 4 offers numerical 76 \nexamples. Concluding remarks are offered in the last section.  77 \n2. Definitions and Model Assumptions 78 \nThis section first borrows the definition of geometric process from Lam (1988), and then makes 79 \nassumptions for the paper. 80 \n2.1 Definition 81 \nDefinition 1  Assume \u03be , \u03b7  are the two random variables. For arbitrary real number \u03b1 , there is 82 \n(P \u03be \u2265\u03b1 ) > (P \u03b7 \u2265\u03b1 )  83 \nthen \u03be is called stochastically bigger than \u03b7 .  Similarly, if \u03be  stochastically smaller than \u03b7 . 84 \nDefinition 2 (Lam 1988) Assume that { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is a sequence of independent non-negative 85 \nrandom variables. If the distribution function of nX  is )(\n1taF n\u2212 ,  for some a>0 and all, n=1,2, \u2026, then 86 \n{ nX , n=1,2,\u2026}  is called a geometric process. 87 \nObviously,  88 \nif a >1, then { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is stochastically decreasing, 89 \nif a <1, then  { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is stochastically increasing, and 90 \nif a =1, { nX , n=1,2,\u2026} is a renewal process. 91 \n2.2 Assumptions and Denotation 92 \nThe following assumptions are assumed to hold in what follows. 93 \nA. At the beginning, the two components are both new, component 1 is first working and component 2 94 \nis under cold standby. 95 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n5 \nB. When both of the two components are in good condition, one is working and the other is under cold 96 \nstandby.  When the working component fails, a repairman repairs the failed component immediately 97 \nwith probability p, or repairs it with a waiting time with probability 1-p. As soon as the working 98 \ncomponent fails, the standby one will start to work. Assume the switching is perfect. After a failed 99 \none has been repaired, it is either put in use if another one fails or put in standby if another one is 100 \nworking. If one fails while the other is still under repair, the failed one must wait for repair until the 101 \nrepair for another one is completed.  102 \nC. The time interval from the completion of the (n-1)th repair to that of the nth repair of component i  103 \nis called the nth cycle of component i, where i =1,2; ,2,1=n \u2026. Denote the working time and the 104 \nrepair time of component i  in the nth cycle ( i =1, 2; ,2,1=n \u2026) as  Xni( )  and )(inY , respectively. 105 \nDenote the waiting time of component i  ( i =1, 2) in the nth cycle as { )(inZ ,n=1,2,\u2026}. Denote the 106 \ncumulative distribution functions of Xn\ni( ) , )(inY  and )(inZ , as )(xFn   )(xGn , and )(xS , respectively.        107 \nD. Xn\ni( ) , )(inY , and \n)(i\nnZ  (i=1,2, and ,2,1=n \u2026) are statistically independent. 108 \nE. When a replacement is required, a brand new but identical component will be used to replace, and 109 \nthe replacement time is negligible. 110 \nF. Denote the repair cost per unit time of two components as Cm, the working reward per unit time as 111 \nCw, the replacement cost as Cr. 112 \n    113 \n3. Expected cost under replacement policy N 114 \nFigure 1 shows a typical scenario, given the above-mentioned assumption. In what follows, we consider 115 \na replacement policy N, where a replacement is carried out if the number of failures reaches N for the 116 \ncomponent 1.  117 \nFig.1  a possible progressive figure of the system 118 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n6 \nDenote the time between the (n-1)th replacement and the nth replacement of the system as nT . 119 \nObviously, { ,, 21 TT \u2026} forms a renewal process. 120 \nLet )(NC  be the expected long run cost per unit time of the system under the policy N. Because 121 \n{ ,, 21 TT \u2026} is a renewal process, the interval time between two consecutive replacements is a renewal 122 \ncycle.

The expected long-run cost per unit time is shown in Table 2, which corresponds to 180 \nFigure 2. 181 \nFig. 3  The change of )(NC  over N for parameter set 2 182 \nCompare Figures 2 and 3, we can find that the optimum replacement time becomes longer in the second 183 \nsituation. In both situations, we can easily find an optimum replacement time point. However, due to the 184 \ncomplexity of Eq. (11), we are not able to prove that there exists a unique optimal value N. 185 \n6. Conclusions 186 \nCold standby systems are a category of important reliability structure in engineering. Searching an 187 \noptimal replacement point for such systems is of interest and important. This paper derived the expected 188 \nlong run cost per unit time for a cold standby system when time to repair is composed of two time 189 \nperiods: waiting time and real repair time. We also considered a special scenario where the working 190 \ntimes and real repair times are geometric processes. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the 191 \nusefulness of the derived expression. 192 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n10 \nReferences 193 \nCoit, D.W. 2001, \"Cold-standby redundancy optimization for nonrepairable systems\", IIE Transactions 194 \n(Institute of Industrial Engineers), vol. 33, no. 6, pp. 471-478. 195 \nFinkelstein, M.S. 1993, \"A scale model of general repair\", Microelectronics Reliability, vol. 33, no. 1, 196 \npp. 41-44. 197 \nLam, Y. 1988, \"A note on the optimal replacement problem\", Advances in Applied Probability, vol. 20, 198 \nno. 2, pp. 479-482. 199 \nUtkin, L.V. 2003, \"Imprecise reliability of cold standby systems\", Int J Qual Reliab Mgmt, vol. 20, no. 200 \n6, pp. 722-739. 201 \nWang, H. & Pham, H. 1996, \"A quasi renewal process and its applications in imperfect maintenance\", 202 \nInternational Journal of Systems Science, vol. 27, no. 10, pp. 1055-1062. 203 \nWu, S. & Clements-Croome, D. 2006, \"A novel repair model for imperfect maintenance\", IMA Journal 204 \nManagement Mathematics, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 235-243. 205 \nWu, S. & Clements-Croome, D. 2005, \"Optimal maintenance policies under different operational 206 \nschedules\", IEEE Transactions on Reliability, vol. 54, no. 2, pp. 338-346. 207 \nYu, H., Yalaoui, F., Ch\u00e2telet, \u0116 & Chu, C. 2007, \"Optimal design of a maintainable cold-standby 208 \nsystem\", Reliability Engineering & System Safety, vol. 92, no. 1, pp. 85-91. 209 \nZhang, Y.
