Biological\n32 records for Britain and Ireland are integrated and distributed through the National Biodi-\n33 versity Network (NBN) gateway (http:\/\/www.searchnbn.net), an interactive mapping\n34 website holding in excess of 27 million records for over 8,500 species. The biological\n35 recording infrastructure in Great Britain provides an effective tool for monitoring species\n36 undergoing rapid range expansions. Analysis of long-term datasets showed that various\n37 taxa (e.g. dragonflies, butterflies, spiders and fish), are moving northwards in Great Britain\n38 in response to climate change (Hickling et al. 2006). Invasive species are regarded as one\n39 of the most serious threats to biodiversity (Glowka et al. 1994). The monitoring of bio-\n40 logical invasions is vital, in order to understand the population dynamics, habitat tolerance\n41 and impact on native taxa, of the invading species. In Great Britain, monitoring projects for\n42 invasive insects include the horse chestnut leafminer Cameraria ohridella (Deschka and\n43 Dimic) (http:\/\/www.forestresearch.gov.uk\/leafminer), and the rosemary beetle Chrysolina\n44 americana (L.) (http:\/\/www.rhs.org.uk\/research\/projects\/rosemary_beetle.asp).\n45 The harlequin ladybird or multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)\n46 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is native to Asia (e.g. Dobzhansky 1933; Kuznetsov 1997)\n47 and was introduced to North America and Europe to control pest aphid and coccid species\n48 on a range of crops (e.g. Adriaens et al. 2003; Koch 2003). It established in North America\n49 in 1988 (Chapin and Brou 1991), spread very rapidly (Koch 2003), and became the\n50 dominant coccinellid in many areas (Colunga-Garcia and Gage 1998; Smith et al. 1996;\n51 Tedders and Schaefer 1994). In mainland Europe, H. axyridis was first marketed as a\n52 biocontrol agent in 1995 (Coutanceau 2006), established in the late 1990s and expanded its\n53 range rapidly, especially from 2002 (Brown et al. submitted). It is not known to have been\n54 deliberately introduced to Great Britain, but arrived by various means, including flight and\n55 on produce from mainland Europe and in packing cases from Canada (Majerus et al.\n56 2006a; Roy et al. 2005). There is no doubt that H. axyridis is an effective aphid predator,\n57 and its presence may be welcomed by some. However, there is concern in Europe about the\n58 rapid increase in distribution and abundance of H. axyridis, and its impact on non-target\n59 species (Adriaens et al. 2003; Majerus et al. 2006b; Roy et al. 2006). Although most\n60 biocontrol companies have stopped selling H. axyridis in Europe, a non-flying variety is\n61 still available from Biotop (http:\/\/www.biotop.fr).\n62 Harmonia axyridis has the potential to contribute to biotic homogenization (McKin-\n63 ney and Lockwood 1999) and to negatively impact on up to 1,000 species in Great\n64 Britain (Majerus in press). These are primarily insects (including non-target Homoptera,\nP. M. J. Brown et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 8-10-2007 Pages : 13\nArticle No. : 9124 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO618 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n65 alternative prey, members of aphidophagous and coccidophagous guilds) and parasites,\n66 parasitoids, pathogens and symbionts of theses species (Majerus, in press). In the USA,\n67 H. axyridis has been declared a potential pest of fruit production and processing, as the\n68 species sometimes feeds on the juices of ripe fruits, such as apples, pears and grapes, in\n69 autumn (Koch 2003). Harmonia axyridis may become seriously pestilent to the native\n70 fauna of Great Britain (Majerus et al. 2006b). This pest status may extend directly to\n71 humans, as H. axyridis tends to form very large overwintering aggregations of thousands\n72 of individuals, often on or in buildings (Adriaens et al. 2003; Kidd et al. 1995). Some\n73 such aggregations were observed in England in 2006 (Brown and Roy 2007).\n74 Uniquely, the early detection of H. axyridis in Britain presented the opportunity to study\n75 the spread of an invasive animal from the year of its arrival (Majerus et al. 2006b). There is\n76 no evidence to suggest that H. axyridis was established in Great Britain before 2004 and\n77 circumstantial evidence that argues against its presence prior to that year (Majerus and Roy\n78 2005). Through detailed mapping of adult and juvenile stages, the objective of our study\n79 was to quantify and analyse the spread of H. axyridis in its early stages of invasion in Great\n80 Britain. A further objective was to investigate the voltinism of H. axyridis in Great Britain,\n81 to determine whether there was evidence of multiple generations per year.\n82 Material and methods\n83 Data collection\n84 The spread of H. axyridis was monitored by utilising the extensive biological recording\n85 community in Great Britain, coupled with engagement of the general public. Recent\n86 advances in technology, and high levels of public access to the internet and digital pho-\n87 tography, enabled a web-based biological survey to be set up. The Harlequin Ladybird\n88 Survey (http:\/\/www.harlequin-survey.org) was one of the first online surveys of its kind in\n89 Great Britain. It was launched in March 2005 in response to the first report of H. axyridis in\n90 Great Britain, in September 2004 (Majerus 2004). The survey benefited from high levels of\n91 media interest, including the front page of The Times on 15 March 2005. Members of the\n92 British public showed great willingness to look for H. axyridis, and to register their\n93 sightings with the survey.\n94 The dataset presented here comprises 4,117 species records of H. axyridis in Great\n95 Britain between 2004 and 2006. Each record represents a verified sighting of H. axyridis\n96 on a given date, and comprises one or more individual ladybirds observed from one or\n97 more life stages (larva, pupa and adult; records of eggs were not included). 76% of these\n98 records were received from members of the British public by post, or entered online at\n99 the Harlequin Ladybird Survey website or UK Ladybird Survey website (http:\/\/www.\n100 ladybird-survey.org); the latter was set up to encourage the recording of native ladybirds.\n101 Verification of the records was made by the authors after receipt of either a specimen or\n102 photograph. Most photographs were received as digital images attached to emails. The\n103 remaining 24% of records were received from coleopterists and other naturalists, and in\n104 particular from the London and Essex Ladybird Survey. Such records were not verified\n105 by the authors but are regarded as accurate and so have been included in the dataset. A\n106 further 4,316 online records were received that remain unverified (i.e. no photograph or\n107 specimen was sent), or were verified as another species, and so are not included in the\n108 analyses. Verified records were regularly uploaded to the database of the National\nSpread of Harmonia axyridis in Great Britain\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 8-10-2007 Pages : 13\nArticle No. : 9124 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO618 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n109 Biodiversity Network. There they could be viewed via online maps, which helped to\n110 encourage further recording.\n111 Each species record includes the following data: recorder name; location of sighting\n112 (the grid reference of the Ordinance Survey British national grid reference system);\n113 locality\/site name (not included for all records); date of sighting; life stage observed (larva,\n114 pupa, adult); number of each life stage observed (assumed to equal 1, if not specified); and\n115 determiner name. Additional optional attributes include the number of each colour form of\n116 any adults observed (included for 82% of records), and supplementary comments,\n117 including habitat and\/or behavioural information.\n118 Three main colour forms of adult H. axyridis have been found in Great Britain:\n119 f. succinea, f. spectabilis and f. conspicua. The succinea complex has been divided into\n120 many subforms (e.g. siccoma\u20140 spots; frigida\u20146 spots; novemdecimsignata\u201419 spots)\n121 (Dobzhansky 1933), but is treated as a single form here. Thus f. succinea has elytra with a\n122 ground colour of yellow, orange, or red, and 0\u201321 black spots, which may or may not be\n123 fused. F. spectabilis has black elytra with four yellow, orange, or red spots or other shaped\n124 markings, which sometimes contain a central black spot. F. conspicua is as f. spectabilis,\n125 but with only two spots.\n126 The spatial resolution of the records is variable, and while approximately 20% include a\n127 grid reference, enabling resolution to 100 m, the other approximate 80% of records were\n128 derived at 1 km resolution from a UK postal code (UK Government Data Standards\n129 Catalogue, http:\/\/www.govtalk.gov.uk\/gdsc\/html\/frames\/PostCode.htm). The option on the\n130 online recording form to enter the location via a UK postal code was provided to make the\n131 entry of records easier for members of the public unfamiliar with the grid reference system.\n132 Whilst the resolution is thus reduced for these records, the reduction in user error (e.g. the\n133 problem of grid reference eastings and northings being transposed), is an advantage\n134 (Majerus et al. 1990). The postal code method was applicable for sightings of H. axyridis\n135 made within 200 m of a specified postal code, so could not be used for a minority of\n136 records where the ladybird was seen in a semi-natural habitat.\n137 Variability in recording effort (both temporally and spatially) is clearly an issue when\n138 analysing a dataset of the kind presented here. Other factors being equal, more records\n139 will come from areas with a higher density of recorders. Across Great Britain there\n140 were a number of particularly active local groups or individuals, which contributed\n141 hotspots of recorder activity, potentially biasing the results for certain areas, e.g.\n142 London, because of the high activity of the London and Essex Ladybird Survey. The\n143 Harlequin Ladybird Survey benefited from a high profile and enjoyed frequent local and\n144 national media attention, thus potentially increasing the volume of records received at\n145 certain times. To minimise these effects, the data have mostly been analysed in terms of\n146 the presence of H. axyridis in 10 km squares (1 km squares for juveniles) by year.\n147 Thus, whether the species was recorded just once or many times in any given square in\n148 a year, is not reflected in the analyses. To many recorders, juvenile stages were less\n149 noticeable and more difficult to identify than the adult stage, thus generally limiting the\n150 recording of juveniles.\n151 The possibility of a reporting bias towards sightings early in the season also existed (i.e.\n152 some recorders may have reported their first sighting of H. axyridis, but not subsequent\n153 sightings). In order to minimise this effect, the importance of recording multiple sightings\n154 was stressed to recorders. The peaks in record numbers observed late in each year also\n155 suggest that any effect of this potential bias was minor.\nP. M. J. Brown et al.\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 8-10-2007 Pages : 13\nArticle No. : 9124 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO618 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n156 Rate of spread\n157 The location of the northern range margin of H. axyridis in Great Britain was measured by\n158 calculating the mean northing of the ten most northerly 10 km squares occupied each year\n159 (Hickling et al. 2006). The location of the range margins in the westerly and north-westerly\n160 directions were calculated each year using the same method. There is a very strong\n161 assumption that H. axyridis colonised Great Britain primarily from the coastal regions of\n162 northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands (Majerus et al. 2006a), hence the inclusion\n163 of the north-westerly direction.\n164 Seasonal pattern\n165 The seasonal pattern of H. axyridis sightings in 2005 and 2006 were examined. Harmonia\n166 axyridis was first recorded in Great Britain in July 2004, so that year was excluded from the\n167 analyses because of incomplete data. The data are weekly counts of the occurrence of\n168 H. axyridis in grid squares. For adult H. axyridis 10 km squares were used, but for\n169 juveniles (i.e. larvae and pupae), because of a lower number of records, 1 km squares were\n170 used.\n171 Seasonal patterns were analysed using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) in which\n172 the counts varied randomly about a smooth trend described by a cubic smoothing spline\n173 (Green and Silverman 1994). The degrees of freedom for the fitted GAM were determined\n174 using cross-validation (leaving out each data point in turn) and minimising the cross-\n175 validation Poisson deviance. A GAM was fitted separately to data from 2005 and 2006 to\n176 describe the seasonal pattern of observations in each year. The number of sightings was\n177 generally higher throughout 2006 compared to 2005, but the GAM curves allow com-\n178 parison of the shape of the seasonal pattern each year. The null hypothesis of equality of\n179 shape in 2005 and 2006 implies that curves differ by some constant factor, i.e. parallel on a\n180 log scale. The alternative hypothesis allows different curves in each year. The test-statistic\n181 is F = f (Dnull \u0002 Dalt)\/(dfnull \u0002 dfalt)g \/Dalt\/dfalt,where D denotes the residual deviance and\n182 df is the corresponding degrees of freedom. On the null hypothesis, the statistic follows an\n183 F distribution with (dfnull \u2013 dfalt) and dfalt degrees of freedom.

Westerly spread was faster than northerly spread by a factor of approximately\n227 2.5, and this may partly be explained by the likelihood of repeated recruitment of\n228 H. axyridis from mainland Europe. Indeed, in 2006, eight of the ten most westerly 10 km\n229 squares occupied were in the extreme south-west of England and close to the coast,\n230 possibly representing new recruits from abroad, rather than spread from the existing British\n231 range. This factor is presumed not to apply to the most northerly squares occupied, because\n50403020100\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nWeek\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf s\nqu\nar\nes\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf s\nqu\nar\nes\n50403020100\n50(b)\n(a)\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nWeek\nFig. 3 Adult H. axyridis\noccurrence in 10 km squares in\nGreat Britain with fitted GAMs\nand degrees of freedom (df).

Ecological factors such as climate and habitat type may also have\n234 influenced the faster westerly spread. In late October and early November 2006 there was\n235 an influx of reports of large aggregations of H. axyridis adults, mainly at locations close to\n236 the south coast of England. Aggregations of hundreds and in a few cases, thousands, of\n237 H. axyridis were observed (Brown and Roy 2007). Whether these large aggregations\n238 represented new recruits from mainland Europe has yet to be determined.\n239 The most closely related species to H. axyridis in Great Britain is Harmonia quadri-\n240 punctata (Pontoppidan). This species is also a relatively recent arrival to Britain, but is now\n241 regarded as a native species, having expanded its native range northwards within Europe,\n242 and is assumed to have reached Britain by natural means (Majerus and Kearns 1989;\n243 Majerus 1994). It is not considered invasive. Although H. quadripunctata is far more\n244 habitat-specific than H. axyridis, and the mechanisms of spread may not be the same, a\n245 comparison of the rate of spread of the two species is enlightening. Majerus and Kearns\n246 (1989) outline the spread of H. quadripunctata.

Our data show that\n249 H. axyridis took just two years to spread to Devon from a similar starting point in East\n250 Anglia.\n251 In Great Britain, the northerly range expansion of some insect groups was calculated by\n252 Hickling et al. (2006), giving figures of up to 4.2 km year\u20131 (over a 25 year period) for the\n253 most dispersive taxa (dragonflies); but these range expansions were for native species\n254 responding to climate change, rather than for invasive species. There is limited quantitative\n255 data on the spread of invasive insects in Europe. The spread of the horse chestnut leafminer\n256 C. ohridella in Germany in the late 1990s was modelled, and the rate of spread calculated\n257 to vary between 54 km year\u20131 and 330 km year\u20131 (Gilbert et al. 2004), figures of the same\n258 order of magnitude as our calculations for H. axyridis in Britain. In eastern North America\n259 the rate of range expansion of H. axyridis was estimated at 442 km year\u20131 (McCorquodale\n260 1998). As it was probably confounded by many intentional releases at various locations\n261 (McCorquodale 1998), this very fast expansion is not a fair comparison with that observed\n262 in Great Britain. Expansion was thought to be slower in other parts of North America\n263 (Koch et al. 2006).\n264 Abundance and mechanism of spread\n265 Abundance of H. axyridis in Great Britain increased rapidly from 2004 to 2006, and this\n266 trend is predicted to continue. There is very strong demographic evidence that the spread of\n267 H. axyridis in Great Britain did not originate from a single immigration event, and that the\n268 species arrived at different locations at various times, and by various means. Apart from\n269 the spread (by flight) from continental Europe, some specimens of H. axyridis are known to\n270 have arrived in England on imported flowers from the Netherlands, and in packing cases\n271 from Canada (Majerus et al. 2006a). By 2004, H. axyridis had sufficient time to adapt to\n272 conditions in mainland Europe and was building-up in number and spreading fast. Crossing\n273 the English Channel to reach Great Britain was not a major step. It is a coincidence that\n274 specimens from Canada were found in Great Britain for the first time in the same year, and\n275 it is possible that it had arrived by similar mechanisms in earlier years, but failed to be\n276 noticed and failed to establish.\n277 A separate population of H. axyridis was evident in Derby (central England) in 2004,\n278 which is thought to have originated from specimens arriving with produce to a supermarket\n279 in the city (W. Grange, personal communication). Derby was not the most northerly\n280 verified location of H. axyridis in 2004 (a single specimen was recorded in Lancashire, but\n281 with no evidence of subsequent establishment), but is the only place outside of the\n282 southeast with multiple verified records of H. axyridis in each of 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n283 Large numbers of H. axyridis (three records each of 50+ individuals) were recorded in\n284 Derby in 2005. The colour form profile of the Derby population almost totally lacked\n285 melanics in 2004 and 2005 (99.6% f. succinea; n = 495), in contrast to other parts of the\n286 country, where melanic specimens formed a significant proportion of the population\n287 (a mean of 20% melanic specimens were recorded in 2005). The clear difference in colour\n288 form profile strongly suggests a genetically distinct population, and further work is in\n289 progress to examine this.\n290 The observed reduction in both the number of juvenile records, and mean number of\n291 juveniles per record, from 2005 to 2006, is not believed to reflect a true reduction in\n292 breeding activity. Rather, this is likely to be the effect of reduced recorder effort. In\nP. M. J.

A 47% increase in the number of 10 km squares with\n296 juvenile records from 2005 to 2006 suggests that there was in fact an increase in breeding\n297 activity.\n298 Examples of invasive species in Great Britain exhibiting a \u2018boom-and-bust\u2019 population\n299 cycle are unusual, although this scenario did apply to the rhododendron lacebug Stephanitis\n300 rhododendri (Horvath) (Williamson 1996). The evidence from almost 20 years as an\n301 established introduced species in North America suggests that this will not apply to\n302 H. axyridis on either side of the Atlantic.\n303 Evidence of bi-voltinism\n304 Some of the common and widespread coccinellid species in Britain, e.g. Coccinella sep-\n305 tempunctata (L.), are limited by the requirement of a winter dormancy period before they\n306 can reproduce (Majerus 1994). Harmonia axyridis does not have this limit to population\n307 growth and may have several generations per year, five having been recorded in Asia\n308 (Wang 1986) and four in southern Europe (Katsoyannos et al. 1997). In the cool and damp\n309 maritime climate of Great Britain, we predict H. axyridis will achieve two, or possibly\n310 three, generations per year. There is evidence of a second generation in 2006 in the data\n311 presented here, with a summer peak (week 24) and an autumn peak (week 40), in juvenile\n312 records. Production of two generations would help to explain the very rapid spread of\n313 H. axyridis observed.\n314 Habitat use\n315 The dataset reflects a somewhat urban distribution. Although some of this effect may be\n316 biased by higher recorder effort in urban areas, it is assumed to be the result of genuine\n317 habitat preference by H. axyridis. Lime trees, Tilia sp. and sycamore trees, Acer sp. were\n318 recorded as favoured habitats, and these trees are generally found in Britain in urban\n319 locations, such as parks, gardens, lining roads and churchyards. Whether H. axyridis will\n320 thrive in semi-natural habitats is a question that remains to be answered, and an important\n321 one in terms of the potential impact of the species on native coccinellids and other insects.\n322 Harmonia axyridis has been recorded in various semi-natural habitats in Great Britain,\n323 including reedbeds, and on planted and self-seeded Pinus sylvestris (L.) in East Anglia.\n324 Mature P. sylvestris is an important habitat for several native coccinellids, including Anatis\n325 ocellata (L.), Myzia oblongoguttata (L.) and Myrrha octodecimguttata (L.) (Majerus\n326 1994). Evidence of the strength of intraguild predation by H. axyridis (Pell et al. submitted;\n327 Roy et al. in press; Ware and Majerus submitted; Ware et al. in press) deepens concern that\n328 the species will have a serious negative impact on native coccinellids.\n329 Conclusion\n330 We predict that the spread of H. axyridis in Great Britain will continue at a rapid pace, and\n331 that the species will become established in Scotland by the end of 2008. To determine the\n332 impact of H. axyridis on native species, monitoring of ladybird populations is required in\nSpread of Harmonia axyridis in Great Britain\n123\nJournal : Small 10526 Dispatch : 8-10-2007 Pages : 13\nArticle No. : 9124 h LE h TYPESET\nMS Code : BICO618 h CP h DISK4 4\nE\nd\nit\no\nr\n P\nr\no\no\nf\nU\nN\nC\nO\nR\nR\nE\nC\nT\nE\nD\nP\nR\nO\nO\nF\n333 semi-natural habitats and urban habitats, both of which can support high abundance and\n334 species richness. Quantitative research at appropriate spatial and temporal scales is\n335 essential, if we are to objectively assess the ecological impact of H. axyridis. Field studies\n336 need to focus on habitat use by this species and its interactions within the large guild of\n337 associated aphidophagous species. Harmonia axyridis has many traits that have ensured its\n338 status as a successful invasive alien species. The continued population expansion within\n339 and beyond its invaded range seems inevitable.\n340 Acknowledgements We extend our thanks to all of the following, who have helped to make the Harlequin\n341 Ladybird Survey a success: the thousands of naturalists and members of the British public who have\n342 provided records; Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, National Biodiversity Network\n343 Trust, Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural Environment Research Council, University of Cam-\n344 bridge and Anglia Ruskin University for funding and support; Paul Mabbott and recorders from the London\n345 and Essex Ladybird Survey; Trevor James, Jim Munford and Andrew Brewer of the National Biodiversity\n346 Network Trust; Mark Hill, Cassie Hoyland and Henry Arnold of the Biological Records Centre; Ian Wright,\n347 Laura-Jane Michie, James Waters and Francis Rowland of University of Cambridge; Julian Doberski of\n348 Anglia Ruskin University; and finally Robert Frost and William Grange for records and valuable\n349 contributions.\n3501\n352 References\n353 Adriaens T, Branquart E, Maes D (2003) The multicoloured Asian ladybird Harmonia axyridis Pallas\n354 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), a threat for native aphid predators in Belgium?
