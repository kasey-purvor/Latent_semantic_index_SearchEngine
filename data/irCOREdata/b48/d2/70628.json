INTRODUCTION\nDisorder in semiconductor heterostructures has\nstrong influence on their optoelectronic properties.\nIndependently of whether disorder is introduced by\ndesign or due to random interface roughness or com-\npositional fluctuations it can significantly alter the\nproperties of the heterostructure [1\u20137]. Recent pub-\nlications show that long-range spatial disorder is an\nimportant topic from both the technological and the\nfundamental point of view [5, 8\u201310].\nIn order to enhance our understanding of the role\nof disorder in these systems, we have recently pro-\nposed an experimental scheme [11] which can be\nviewed as the Fourier analogue of nano- or micro-\nluminescence [12\u201315]. This scheme is based on mea-\nsuring angular correlations of spontaneously emitted\nlight and has been shown to give direct access to\nthe spatial distribution of the optically active elec-\ntronic states and to the effect of disorder on them.\nAs our numerical investigations have shown the spa-\ntial distribution can be recovered very reliably via\na Fourier transformation of the experimentally mea-\nsurable photonic correlation [11].\nIn the present paper we present an extended ana-\nlytical study using a simplified model of uncoupled\ntwo-level systems. The additional simplification in-\ntroduced by neglecting the many-body interactions\nallows us to deepen our understanding and present\nthe fundamental principles behind the suggested re-\nconstruction procedure in a more transparent way.\nOne of the aims is to get a more intuitive under-\nstanding of the measured correlation function, such\nthat a basic understanding of the characteristic pa-\nrameters of the disorder landscape can be gained\nfrom the direct measurement results without any re-\nconstruction procedure.\nThe paper is structured as follows: We describe\nthe experimental setup, introduce the important\nphoton-correlation functions, and outline the re-\nconstruction procedure in Sec. II. In Sec. III we\npresent general analytical results for a system of non-\ninteracting two-level systems where the disorder ap-\npears as a varying transition energy from site to site.\nFinally, we choose a sinusoidal model potential in-\nstead of a truly random disorder potential. For this\nspecial case, further analytical results are derived in\nSec. IV before we conclude.\nII. MEASURING CORRELATIONS\nOur suggested scheme is based on the angular\nphotonic correlations of spontaneously emitted light.\nPrevious calculations have shown that not only pho-\nton numbers \u3008B\u2020qBq\u3009, but also single-photon corre-\nlations of the form \u3008B\u2020qBq\u2032\u3009 between photons of dif-\nferent modes (q 6= q\u2032) are building up when a semi-\nconductor heterostructure reaches quasi-equilibrium\nand spontaneously emits light [16]. While the rate\nof photons \u2202\u2202t \u3008B\u2020qBq\u3009 is proportional to the photo-\nluminescence (PL) spectrum at energy \u03c9q = c|q|\nand thus directly accessible to experiment [16, 17],\na clever setup must be used in order to measure\nthe complex correlations. The simplest possibility\nis to combine the light propagating along two dif-\nferent directions in a common detector. Here, the\nlight emitted into directions q and q\u2032 is redirected\nwith the help of mirrors and through a beam splitter\ncombined into the same detector. Consequently, the\n2detector detects the combined beam and the correct\ndetector operator for the description of the measure-\nment process is given by\ndq,q\u2032 = Bq + ei\u03c6Bq\u2032 , (1)\ni.e. a superposition of the photon operators of the\ntwo directions. The variable phase \u03c6 is adjusted via\nthe optical path length difference between the two\nlight beams. The detected signal is proportional to\nthe number operator corresponding to dq,q\u2032 and thus\ngiven by\n\u3008d\u2020q,q\u2032dq,q\u2032\u3009 =\n\u2329(\nB\u2020q + e\n\u2212i\u03c6B\u2020q\u2032\n) (\nBq + ei\u03c6Bq\u2032\n)\u232a\n=\n\u2329\nB\u2020qBq\n\u232a\n+\n\u2329\nB\u2020q\u2032Bq\u2032\n\u232a\n+ 2 Re\n\u2329\nei\u03c6B\u2020qBq\u2032\n\u232a\n.(2)\nThe first two terms on the right hand side of Eq. (2)\nare nothing but the separate PL spectra emitted into\nthe two different directions while the interference\nterm shows that also photon-correlations between\nthe two different emission directions can be made\nvisible. As previous results have shown, correlations\ncan only build up if q\u2016 = q\u2032\u2016 in the case of perfectly\nordered system [18]. Here the parallel subscript de-\nnotes the component of the wave vector along the\nquantum well (QW).\nWhile the measured signal according to Eq. (2)\nstill depends on a total of six components of q and\nq\u2032, a few simplifications can be introduced accord-\ning to the actual experiment; firstly, a spectrome-\nter is used in order to achieve a spectrally and an-\ngularly resolved signal. The spectrometer is intro-\nduced after recombining the two emission directions\ninto one beam and before the detector. Therefore,\nonly the signal for equal |q| = |q\u2032| has to be com-\nputed. Furthermore, our previous numerical inves-\ntigations have shown that the interference depends\nmuch stronger on the difference q\u2016\u2212q\u2032\u2016 than on the\naverage value such that we define the angular corre-\nlation\nUh\u00af\u03c9(\u2206q\u2016) =\n\u2329\nB\u2020qBq\u2032\n\u232a\n(3)\nwith the specific choice of q\u2032 = (q\u22a5,\u2212\u2206q\u2016\/2) and\nq = (q\u22a5,\u2206q\u2016\/2) as the key observable. The mag-\nnitude of the perpendicular component of q and q\u2032\nhas to be fixed for each choice of \u2206q\u2016 according to\n\u03c92 = c2(|q\u22a5|2+|\u2206q\u2016|2\/4) . Consequently, Uh\u00af\u03c9(\u2206q\u2016)\ndepends on only two parameters, which is sufficient\nfor a spectrally and angularly resolved scan.\nWhile the magnitude of q\u22a5 is determined by \u03c9\nand \u2206q\u2016, the sign can still be chosen differently.\nOur above choice of identical signs for the perpen-\ndicular components of q and q\u2032 represents measure-\nment in e.g. reflection geometry as depicted in Fig. 1\nwhich has the advantage that non-transparent sub-\nstrate can be used as both emission paths are on the\nsame side of the sample. An alternative possibility is\nFIG. 1: Schematic setup of a possible experimental ar-\nrangement for measuring photonic correlations.\nto use light emitted into opposite directions which\ncorresponds to q\u2032 = \u2212q. This setup was success-\nfully applied to detect angular photonic correlations\nin ordered systems [18].\nThe principle idea behind our scheme for the re-\nconstruction of the disorder potential exploits the\nfact that the strict momentum conservation along\nthe direction parallel to the QW is broken by a disor-\nder potential. In contrast to the ordered case where\ninterference could only be observed for \u2206q\u2016 = 0, we\nexpect that non-zero correlations cannot only be ob-\nserved for vanishing \u2206q\u2016 but also for other values.\nPlease note that no such restriction applies to the\ndirection perpendicular to the QW, independently\nif it is perfectly ordered or disordered, because the\ntranslational invariance is broken by the electronic\nconfinement.\nA. Reconstruction procedure\nFor the sake of simplicity of the analytical calcula-\ntions we consider a one-dimensional quantum-wire in\nthe remainder of the paper. In this case, the parallel\ncomponent q\u2016 and the spatial coordinate x along the\nwire are scalars. Apparently, all conclusions about\nmomentum conservation hold as for a QW. To sim-\nplify the notation we use \u2206q instead of \u2206q\u2016 in the\nrest of the present work. During the calculations we\nlimit ourselves to two emission directions with both\nplanes of emission (spanned by the one-dimensional\nwire and the emission direction) being identical.\nAccording to Eq. (2), the correlation function\nfrom Eq. (3) can be experimentally measured as an\ninterference contrast [11]. By varying the optical\npath length \u03c6 in a controlled way, it is possible to\nextract both real and imaginary part of Uh\u00af\u03c9(\u2206q)\nsuch that it is legitimate to study the full complex\nvalue of Uh\u00af\u03c9(\u2206q).\nBy Fourier transforming the measured signal ac-\n3cording to\nUh\u00af\u03c9(x) =\n1\n2pi\n\u2206qmax\u222b\n\u2212\u2206qmax\nUh\u00af\u03c9 (\u2206q) e\u2212i\u2206qx d\u2206q (4)\none can obtain information on the spatial distribu-\ntion of emitting sources of energy h\u00af\u03c9. Here \u2206qmax is\ndetermined by the optical cone; since our scheme is\na far-field method, the maximum value of \u2206q acces-\nsible in an experiment is obtained for oblique inci-\ndence and given by approximately \u2206qmax = 2\u03c90\/c =\n4pi\/\u03bb0, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and\n\u03bb0 and \u03c90 are the wavelength and frequency of the\naverage emission frequency.\nFor a fixed value of \u03c9, Eq. (4) can exhibit multi-\nple peaks at all those positions where the band gap\ncorresponds to h\u00af\u03c9 [11]. Thus, Uh\u00af\u03c9(x) can be viewed\nas a probability distribution of the local contribu-\ntions to the emission spectrum. For a fixed value of\nx, on the other hand, Uh\u00af\u03c9(x) has only a single peak\nat the local transition energy such that the average\nenergy can be defined as the weighted mean of the\ntransition energies via\nU(x) =\nE2\u222b\nE1\nh\u00af\u03c9Uh\u00af\u03c9(x) dh\u00af\u03c9\/\nE2\u222b\nE1\nUh\u00af\u03c9(x) dh\u00af\u03c9 . (5)\nHere, E1 and E2 are the limits of the energy scan\ncarried out in the experiment. U(x) is called the\nreconstructed disorder potential [11].\nIt is important to realize that the reconstruction\nprocedure can only work within certain limits. Natu-\nrally, no disorder varying on length scales larger than\nthe spot size can be detected. Furthermore, as with\nevery far-field method, we are limited by the wave-\nlength of the emission and the reconstructed disorder\npotential can only be determined if it varies on a typ-\nical length scale larger than the wavelenght of light.\nIn the present paper we demonstrate this scheme on\nthe basis of a theoretically calculated Uh\u00af\u03c9 (\u2206q) for\nan ensemble of two-level systems.\nIII. CORRELATIONS OF TWO-LEVEL\nSYSTEMS\nAs starting point we consider an ensemble of un-\ncoupled two-level systems as our model system. All\ntwo-level systems are spaced equally along x with\nlattice constant a such that the jth two-level system\nis positioned at the lattice site Rj = aj. By using\nan equation-of-motion approach and evaluating the\nHeisenberg equation of motion [11], we have shown\npreviously that the correlation function can be ex-\npressed as\nUh\u00af\u03c9(\u2206q) =\n2\nh\u00af\n|F\u03c9|2\n\u2211\nj\n\u03b3 Sje\ni\u2206qRj\n(Ej \u2212 h\u00af\u03c9)2 + \u03b32\n. (6)\nHere, the prefactor contains the matrix element F\u03c9\nof the light-matter coupling including the micro-\nscopic interband dipole matrix element, the so-called\nvacuum field amplitude, and the mode strength.\nThe remaining term is a sum over sites with ho-\nmogeneously broadened peaks centered at the site\ntransition energies Ej multiplied by the PL sources\nSj = fej f\nh\nj , where f\ne\nj and f\nh\nj are the electron and\nhole occupation probabilities of the respective site.\nThe phase factor is a consequence of the different\nemission directions and is the key ingredient for ob-\nserving the angle-resolved interference effects.\nTaking the continuum limit a \u2192 0 with con-\nstant PL source density Sj\/a \u2192 S(x) and a con-\ntinuously changing transition energy E(x), we can\nrewrite Eq. (6) as\nUh\u00af\u03c9 (\u2206q) =\n2\nh\u00af\n|F\u03c9|2\n\u222b\n\u03b3ei\u2206qxS(x)\n(E(x)\u2212 h\u00af\u03c9)2 + \u03b32 dx. (7)\nIn the ordered case, all transition energies E(x) =\nE0 are equal such that the angular correlation\nis proportional to a single broadened Lorentzian\nmultiplied by the Fourier transform of the spot,\u222b\nei\u2206qxS(x) dx.\nA. Spatial information\nAccording to Eq. (4), the Fourier transform of the\ncorrelation function gives some spatial information\nabout the position of emitters of a certain frequency\n\u03c9. Starting with the result of Eq. (7), we obtain the\nFourier transform\nUh\u00af\u03c9(x) =\n2|F\u03c9|2 \u2206qmax\nh\u00af\n\u222b\ng\u03b3(E(y)\u2212 h\u00af\u03c9)\nS(y) sinc(\u2206qmax(y \u2212 x)) dy (8)\nwhere we introduced the broadened \u03b4-function\ng\u03b3(E) =\n1\npi\n\u03b3\nE2 + \u03b32\n(9)\nand used the sine-cardinal sinc(x) = sin(x)\/x. The\nbroadening of g\u03b3 is caused by the homogeneous line\nwidth \u03b3 and results in a finite energy resolution. But\nalso \u2206qmax sinc(\u2206qmax x) approaches a Dirac delta\nfunction for large values of \u2206qmax. In that case, the\nbroadening of the sinc function for finite values of\n\u2206qmax reflects the fact that no spatial information\ncan be obtained for variations of the site energies on\nlength scales below the wavelength \u03bb0 = 4pi\/\u2206qmax.\nB. Dimensionless parameters\nAs one can anticipate from Eq. (8), the possibil-\nity to obtain precise spatial information strongly de-\npends on the ratio \u03b3\/W between homogeneous \u03b3 and\n4the disorder strength and on the ratios \u03bb0\/L and\nS\/L between the observed wavelength or the spot\nsize S and the typical disorder length scale L.\nIn order to obtain scaled equations with respect\nto the characteristic parameters W and L of the dis-\norder potential, we introduce u = x\/L and Q =\nL\u2206q as new spatial and momentum coordinates and\n\u2126 = h\u00af\u03c9\/W and \u03b1 = \u03b3\/W as the rescaled fre-\nquency and homogeneous line width. The maxi-\nmum value of u is determined by the spotsize to be\n|u| < umax = S\/2L while Q is confined according\nto |Q| < Qmax = 4piL\u03bb0 . The dimensionless transi-\ntion energy is denoted E\u02dc(x) = E(x)\/W . With the\nhelp of these new variables, we can rewrite Eqs. (6)\nand (8) as\nU\u02dc\u2126(Q) =\n\u222b\ng\u03b1(E\u02dc(u)\u2212 \u2126) eiQu S(u) du , (10)\nU\u02dc\u2126(u) =\n1\npi\nQmax\nL\n\u222b\ng\u03b1(E\u02dc(v)\u2212 \u2126)S(v)\nsinc(Qmax(v \u2212 u)) dv , (11)\nwhere we have eliminated the prefactors by the def-\ninition Uh\u00af\u03c9 = 2piL |F\u03c9|2\/(h\u00afW )U\u02dc\u2126 and g\u03b1(E\u02dc) =\npi\u22121\u03b1\/((E\u02dc2+\u03b12) = Wg\u03b3(E). By virtue of the defini-\ntion of E\u02dc, its fluctuation is on the order of unity and\nthe energy resolution can be directly estimated from\nthe magnitude of \u03b1. In the limit of strong disorder\n(W \u001d \u03b3) corresponding to \u03b1\u2192 0 the broadened g\u03b1\nbecomes a sharp Dirac delta function and we obtain\nU\u02dc\u2126(Q)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nW\u001d\u03b3\n=\n\u2211\nn\neiQun S(un)\n(\ndE\u02dc\ndu\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nu=un(\u2126)\n)\u22121\n(12)\nU\u02dc\u2126(u)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nW\u001d\u03b3\n=\n1\npi\nQmax\nL\n\u2211\nn\nsinc(Qmax(un \u2212 u))\nS(un)\n(\ndE\u02dc\ndu\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nu=un(\u2126)\n)\u22121\n, (13)\nwhere in both equations the sum over n runs over all\nroots un = un(\u2126) of the argument of the delta func-\ntion. These roots are defined via E\u02dc(un(\u2126)) = \u2126.\nObviously, only positions un within the spot can\ncontribute to the correlations, as is guaranteed by\nthe factor S(un) which vanishes outside the excita-\ntion spot.\nAnother interesting limit is obtained for a disorder\nlength scale well above the wavelength of the emit-\nted light, but still below the spotsize. In that limit\nQmax \u001d 1 such that the sine cardinal function can\nbe treated as a sharp delta function and we find\nU\u02dc\u2126(u)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nL\u001d\u03bb0\n=\n1\npi\nQmax\nL\ng\u03b1(E\u02dc(u)\u2212 \u2126)S(u) .(14)\nIn that case, the spatial resolution is very good even\nfor relatively large values of \u03b3 since for fixed u =\nx\/L the correlation function U\u2126(u) has its maximum\nat the transition energy h\u00af\u03c9 = E(x). According to\nEq. (5) the reconstruced potential follows exactly\nthe actual energetic variation E(x).\nIV. MODEL POTENTIAL\nWhile the results of the previous section are valid\nfor a periodic arrangement of non-interacting two-\nlevel systems with arbitrary disorder (i.e. arbitrary\nvariation of the transition energies), we will intro-\nduce additional approximations in the present sec-\ntion in order to simplify the equations even further.\nIn particular, we study the interpretation of U\u02dc\u2126(Q),\ni.e., the direct measurement signal. That way, we\ncan see what information on the disorder potential\ncan be gained from the measurement without per-\nforming any reconstruction.\nFirstly, we assume an infinitely large spot and a\nhomogeneous luminescence source S(x) \u2261 S0. Sec-\nondly, we consider a very specific variation of tran-\nsition energies in the form E\u02dc(u) = E0 + sin(2piu).\nWhile a real disorder potential in general is more\nrandomly fluctuating and might even contain several\ncharacteristic length scales, our more regular model\npotential has a perfectly well defined length scale.\nWith the above mentioned approximations, we\ncan simplify Eq. (10) for \u2126 = E0 and get\nU\u02dc\u2126=E0(Q) =\n\u222b\ng\u03b1(sin(2piu)) eiQu du , (15)\nAfter rewriting the broadened Lorentzian function\nas\ng\u03b1(sin(2piu)) =\ni\n2pi\n(\n1\nsin(2piu) + i\u03b1\n\u2212 1\nsin(2piu)\u2212 i\u03b1\n)\n,\n(16)\nwe can solve the integral in Eq. (15) with the help of\nCauchy\u2019s theorem where the contour of the integra-\ntion has to be closed in the upper (lower) complex\nplane for positive (negative) sign of Q, respectively.\nThe poles of the two contributions of Eq. (16) are\ngiven by the roots of the energy denominators. The\nroots of the first denominator are defined by the\nequation\nsin(2piu) = \u2212i\u03b1 . (17)\nIntroducing the quantity\ny0 = asinh(\u03b1) = ln\n(\n\u03b1+\n\u221a\n1 + \u03b12\n)\n, (18)\nwe can express the solutions of Eq. (17) as\nu\n(m)\n1,\u2212 = \u2212\ni\n2pi\ny0+m, u\n(m)\n1,+ = +\ni\n2pi\ny0+m+\n1\n2\n, (19)\nfor integer values of m. The subscripts + and \u2212\nsignify whether the pole lies in the upper or lower\n5complex plane. Similarly, the poles of the second\ncontribution of Eq. (16) are given by\nu\n(m)\n2,\u2212 = \u2212\ni\n2pi\ny0+m+\n1\n2\n, u\n(m)\n2,+ = +\ni\n2pi\ny0+m. (20)\nThe residues of the integrand of Eq. (15) are given\nby\nRes\n[\ni\n2pi\neiQu\nsin(2piu) + i\u03b1\n;u\n(m)\n1,\u00b1\n]\n= \u00b1 1\n2pii\n1\n2pi\ne\niQu\n(m)\n1,\u00b1\ncosh(y0)\n,\n(21)\nRes\n[\ni\n2pi\neiQu\nsin(2piu)\u2212 i\u03b1 ;u\n(m)\n2,\u00b1\n]\n= \u2213 1\n2pii\n1\n2pi\ne\niQu\n(m)\n2,\u00b1\ncosh(y0)\n,\n(22)\nsuch that after inserting the explicit solutions for\nu\n(m)\n1\/2,\u00b1 we obtain\nU\u02dc\u2126=E0(Q) =\n1\n2pi\ne\u2212\n|Q|y0\n2pi\ncosh(y0)\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\neiQn\/2 . (23)\nEmploying the identity\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\neiQn\/2 = 4pi\n\u221e\u2211\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(Q\u2212 4pim) (24)\nwe obtain the final result\nU\u02dc\u2126=E0(Q) = 4\ng\u2212\n|Q|\n2pi\ng + g\u22121\n\u221e\u2211\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\u03b4(Q\u2212 4pim) .(25)\nHere we have introduced\ng = \u03b1+\n\u221a\n1 + \u03b12 (26)\nand used the definition of y0 as well as the relations\ne\u2212\n|Q|y0\n2pi = (cosh(y0) + sinh(y0))\n\u2212 |Q|2pi = g\u2212\n|Q|\n2pi ,(27)\ncosh(y0) =\n\u221a\n1 + \u03b12 =\n1\n2\n(g + g\u22121) . (28)\nOur result, Eq. (25), nicely demonstrates that for\nthe sinusoidal model potential the expected angular\ncorrelation consists of regularly spaced delta func-\ntions multiplied with an envelop function which ex-\nponentially decays with |Q|. The decay rate with\nrespect to |Q| is determined by ln(g) and thus a func-\ntion of the ratio \u03b1 = \u03b3\/W . The different peaks are\nlocated at integer multiples of 4pi corresponding to\na spacing of 4pi\/L for the unscaled variable \u2206q.\nIn order to confirm our results and study the in-\nfluence of a finite spot size, we display the envelope\nfunction 4g\u2212\n|Q|\n2pi \/(g + g\u22121) together with the results\nof two numerical computations for finite spot size\nin Fig. 2a. Here, we have normalized the result to\na maximum value of 1 and plotted the correlation\nas a function of \u2206q\/q0 where the wavenumber q0\ncorresponds to an assumed emission wavelength of\n\u22121 0 1\n0\n0.5\n1\n~1\/S\n4pi \/ L\n\u2206q \/ q0\n \n|U E\n0(\u2206\nq)|\n \/ |\nU E\n0(0\n)|\na)\n0 5 10\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03c3\/\u03b3\n1\/\ng\n2\nb)\nFIG. 2: a) Correlation function Uh\u00af\u03c9=E0(\u2206q) as function\nof \u2206q\/q0 for a sinusoidal potential and different spot-\nsizes. Comparison between the analytically computed\nenvelope function (thick solid line) and the numerical\nresult for a spotsize of S = 10\u00b5m (thin solid line) and\nS = 20\u00b5m (dashed line). Furthermore indicated are\nthe peakwidth proportional to the inverse spotsize and\nthe peak distance inversely proportaion to the disorder\nlength scale. Numerical parameters are \u03b3 = 1 meV,\nW\/\u03b3 = 20, L = 1 \u00b5m.\nb) The height of the second maximum of Uh\u00af\u03c9=E0(\u2206q)\nas a function of the variance of the disorder potential.\nThick line: sinusoidal potential, analytical result. Dots:\nnumerical results for arbitrary spot size. The dashed line\ngives the thick line divided by 2. For random potentials\nof various length scales L the resulting curves are situ-\nated in the shaded area. The thin line is a guide for the\neye.\n\u03bb0 = 800 nm. The distance between neighbouring\nsites has been chosen a = 5 nm.\nWe notice that our predictions are confirmed by\nthe numerical simulations and that furthermore the\nfinite spotsize does not influence the envelope func-\ntion. While the width of the peaks is inversely pro-\nportional to the spotsize, both their height and their\nposition do not depend on S. In a real experiment,\nwe can thus expect that the distance between the\ncentral peak and the first neighbouring peak is a sig-\nnature of the longest disorder length scale involved,\nwhile the ratio between the peak heights of first and\nsecond peak, given by\nU\u02dc\u2126=E0(4pi)\nU\u02dc\u2126=E0(0)\n= g\u22122 , (29)\n6can provide a measure of the ratio between homoge-\nneous \u03b3 and the disorder fluctuation W . For known\nhomogeneous broadening, one can thus extract in-\nformation on the energetic spread of the transition\nenergies.\nA good measure of the energy fluctuations for very\ndifferent kinds of disorder potentials is given by the\nstandard deviation \u03c3. For a general random poten-\ntial used in a numerical computation, the standard\ndeviation is obtained via\n\u03c32 =\n1\nN\n\u2211\nj\n(Ej \u2212 E\u00af)2 (30)\nas a sum over the lattice sites, where E\u00af is the average\nenergy and N is the total number of sites. For our\nsinusoidal model potential in the continuum limit,\nwe must use the integral form\n\u03c32 =\n1\nL\n\u222b L\n0\nsin2(2pix\/L) dx = W 2\/2 . (31)\nThe result shows that the standard deviation in\nthat case is simply proportional to the amplitude\nof the sinusoidal function. For a comparison be-\ntween the analytical model system and numerical\nsolutions with random disorder potentials, a sys-\ntematic study of the ratio g\u22122 as function of \u03c3\/\u03b3 is\nshown in Fig. 2b. As a consequence of the random\ndisorder potential, also the peak ratios for different\nrealizations are different. The shaded area denotes\nthe region in which all numerical results of a large\nnumber of simulations have been found. The ana-\nlytical result (thick solid line) is found to be roughly\ntwice as large over the whole range of \u03c3 values. An-\nalytical tests with a superposition of more than one\nsine function have shown that the analytical result\nfor such a model also decreases towards the numer-\nically observed region.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, the presented analytical derivation\nof angular photonic correlations supports the results\nof previously published numerical investigations [11]\nand helps to understand the underlying principles of\nthe suggested reconstruction scheme.\nWe have derived the angular correlation function\nfor an ensemble of uncoupled two-level systems.\nIn that model, the correlation function has been\nfound to be given by the Fourier transform of the\nexcitation spot for a perfectly ordered system while\nthe presence of disorder shows up in a deviation\nfrom this shape. The spatial distribution of emitters\ncan be recovered via a Fourier transformation. For a\nsinusoidal model potential analytical formulas have\nbeen derived for the dependency of the primary ex-\nperimentally detectable signal on the characteristic\nstrength and length scale of the disorder potential.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to H.
