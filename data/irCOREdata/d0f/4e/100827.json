Multiple Coulomb excitation is a particularly well\nadapted technique to investigate nuclear shapes @1#. It has\nbeen shown, for example, that the 186,188,190,192Os, and\n194,196Pt nuclei are b-stiff and g-soft @2#, with decreasing\nquadrupole collectivity and increasing g softness ~and triaxi-\nality! as the neutron number increases and the N5126 closed\nshell is approached @3,4#. For all these nuclei the effective g\ndeformation is large, between 15\u00b0 and 35\u00b0.\nThere is, however, little known about the role of triaxial-\nity in well deformed nuclei. Generally, these nuclei are con-\nsidered to be axially symmetric, involving triaxiality only for\nthe explanation of a few phenomena. For example, in the\nHf-W-Os nuclei with 100<N<106, the breakdown of the K\nselection rule ~where K is the projection of the angular mo-\nmentum on the symmetry axis! leads to relatively short life-\ntimes of K isomers. This has been explained by quantum\ntunneling through the g degree of freedom @5,6#, though the\npossible role of static ~equilibrium! g deformation @7# re-\nquires further clarification.\nTo understand better the role of triaxiality in well de-\nformed nuclei it is a natural choice to study the neutron-\ndeficient osmium isotopes. However, the Coulomb excitation\ntechnique is no longer available ~the targets would be radio-\nactive! and an alternative approach is required.

Different\nquadrupole moments could indicate different degrees of tri-\naxiality, assuming that the quadrupole b2 deformations are\nsimilar. In odd-mass nuclei, the g rigidity can sometimes\nincrease due to the properties of the odd nucleon @8#. More-\nover, different single-particle orbitals have different\ntriaxiality-driving effects. Considering the chain of the os-\nmium isotopes, the even-even 180,182,184Os nuclei are the\nmost deformed and most rigid, with the lowest lying first\nexcited ~rotational! states, the highest quadrupole transition\nstrengths, and the highest g-vibrational bandheads\nB(E2;21\u21920 1) @9,10#. Therefore, 181Os is a good example\nto investigate the effect of triaxiality in a well deformed\nnucleus. Here we present the results of a recent lifetime mea-\nsurement, using the coincidence recoil-distance ~plunger!\nmethod @11,12#.\nThe 181Os nucleus has been populated via the\n160Gd(26Mg,5n) reaction. The beam was delivered by the\ntandem accelerator of A.W. Wright Nuclear Structure Labo-\nratory of Yale University. The target consisted of\n0.49 mg\/cm2 160Gd on a 1.5 mg\/cm2 natTa support. It was\nmounted with the tantalum support facing the beam in the\nNew Yale Plunger Device @13,14# in front of a 6 mg\/cm2\nstretched gold stopper foil. The incident beam energy of 124\nMeV corresponded to 117 MeV in the middle of the 160Gd\ntarget. Data were taken at 15 stopper-target distances be-\ntween 8 mm and 600 mm. Each flight distance up to\n300 mm was controlled and regulated via a piezoelectric\nfeedback system. The g rays were detected with the SPEEDY\nGe-detector array @15#, consisting of seven clover detectors\nplus one \u201970% efficient coaxial detector. Events with at\nleast two Ge detectors firing in coincidence were written to\ntape.\nThe Ge detectors of the SPEEDY array were organized into\nthree rings at mean angles of 0\u00b0, 41.5\u00b0, and 138.5\u00b0 relative\u00a92002 The American Physical Society04-1\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nZS.

For each target-stopper distance the\nCompton-suppressed gg doubles and higher-fold events\nwere sorted into asymmetric gg matrices with one particular\nring on each axis. The three rings correspond to eight differ-\nent matrices ~at 0\u00b0 there was only one detector!, resulting in\na total of 120 matrices for the 15 target-stopper distances.\nIn the analysis of the decay function, the differential de-\ncay curve method ~DDCM! @11,12# was used. This allows\ndetermination of the lifetime of the state of interest unam-\nbiguously since the uncertainties about feeding times and\nintensities are avoided. In the DDCM, one gates on the\nshifted component of the feeding transition and analyses the\nstopped ~unshifted! and shifted parts of the depopulating\ntransition. The lifetime of the state is given by\nt5\nIu\nd\ndIs\nd\/dt\n, ~1!\nwhere Iu\nd and Is\nd are the intensities of the unshifted and\nshifted components of the depopulating transition, and t\n5d\/v is the flight time.\nIn general, the given lifetimes were determined from the\nsum spectra obtained by gating on all the eight matrices for\nany target-stopper distance, reducing in this way the statisti-\ncal errors. These lifetimes were checked by comparing with\nthose obtained from individual matrices, in order to avoid\nsystematic errors. In some cases, depending on the contami-\nnating transitions, some of the matrices were not used.\nThe velocity of the recoiling nucleus was determined by\nusing the position of the stopped and Doppler-shifted com-\nponents of the strong transitions in 181,182Os. The obtained\nrecoil velocity of v53.744(30) mm\/ps corresponds to\n1.248~10!% of the speed of light.\nThe measured lifetimes for the states below the backbend-\ning in the bands based on the 1\/22@521# and 7\/22@514# Nils-\nson orbitals, together with the extracted reduced quadrupole\ntransition probabilities B(E2), are given in Table I. The\nhigher lying levels affected by band crossings will be dis-\ncussed in a future publication.

The dipole-quadrupole mixing of the I\u2192I21\ntransitions and its effect on the internal conversion coeffi-\ncients were taken into account. The d25Ig(E2;I\u2192I\n21)\/Ig(M1;I\u2192I21) mixing-ratio parameter was calcu-\nlated using the relation B(E2;I\u2192I22)\/B(E2;I\u2192I21)\n5@^IK20u(I22)K&\/^IK20u(I21)K&#2, derived from the\nassumption that the quadruple moment has the same value\nwhen extracted both from B(E2;I\u2192I22) and B(E2;I\u2192I\n21) transition strengths. For the cases presented in this pa-\nper the dipole-quadrupole mixing has little effect on the ob-\ntained transition strengths due to low internal-conversion co-\nefficients and\/or small differences between the M1 and E2\nconversion coefficients, and the uncertainties caused by the\nmixing are within the given error limits.\nAssuming that the K structure of the wave functions does\nnot change significantly with spin, the intrinsic quadrupole\nmoment can be obtained from the intraband transition\nstrengths using the formula @18#\nQ258p5 B~E2;I\u2192I22 !\n~2I21 !~2I11 !\n~I21 !I Fcos~g130\u00b0 !\n2cos~g230\u00b0 !\nK2\n~I21 !I G\n22\n. ~2!\nWe note that in the majority of previous works only axial\ndeformation is considered, for which the quadrupole moment\ncomes from the expression Q025(16p\/5)B(E2;I\u2192I\n22)\/^IK20uI22K&2.

Examples of lifetime analysis for the 17\/22 state of the 1\/22@521# band, and 15\/22 and 21\/22 levels of the 7\/22@514# band,\nrespectively. For each distance, the value of the mean life ~upper panel! is deduced from the intensity of the unshifted component Iu ~second\npanel from the top! and from the corresponding time derivative dIs \/dt of the shifted component ~lower panel! of the depopulating transition.\nThe intensity of the unshifted component is also shown ~second panel from the bottom!.The quadrupole moments calculated assuming axial sym-\nmetry (g50\u00b0) are given in Table I. With the assumption of\ng50\u00b0, the quadrupole moment within the K57\/2 band is\nfound to be 17% higher than that in the K51\/2 band. The\nweighted average quadrupole moments Q0 are 6.79(10)e b\nand 5.81 (17)e b, respectively, leading to a difference of\n0.98(19)e b. This would correspond to 16% difference in\nquadrupole deformation b2. Since the quadrupole moments\nin the two bands were extracted from the same experiment\nusing the same procedure, the difference of the Q0 values is\nlargely free of systematic errors. Although a possible reason\nfor the different quadrupole moments in the two bands could\nbe a change in the magnitude of the quadrupole deformation\nb2, a more probable origin is connected with triaxiality.\nTo get a deeper understanding of the nuclear shape, total\nrouthian surface ~TRS! calculations were performed. The\nnonaxial deformed Woods-Saxon potential @21# is employed.\nCollective rotation is investigated in the frame of the cranked\nshell model in the three-dimensional deformation spaces of\nb2 ,g , and b4. Both monopole and double-stretched quadru-\npole pairings are included @22#. The monopole pairing\nstrength G is determined by the average-gap method @23#,\nand quadrupole pairing strengths are obtained by restoring\nthe Galilean invariance broken by the seniority pairing force\n@24#. To avoid the spurious phase transition encountered in\nthe BCS approach, we use approximate particle-number pro-\njection by means of the Lipkin-Nogami method @25#. Pairing\ncorrelations are dependent on the rotational frequency and\ndeformation. In order to include such dependence in the\nTRS, we have performed pairing-deformation-frequency\nself-consistent TRS calculations, i.e., for any given deforma-01130tion and frequency, pairings are self-consistently calculated\nby the HFB-like method @25#. At a given frequency, the de-\nformation of a state is determined by minimizing the calcu-\nlated TRS.\nThe calculations indicate no significant shape changes be-\nlow the backbending, and typical TRS plots corresponding to\nthe two bands of interest are shown in Fig. 2.

However, the TRS calculations give not\nonly a stable b2 deformation, but also a deviation from axial\nsymmetry with g515\u00b0 and g522\u00b0, respectively. Using\nthese g deformations, the experimental quadrupole moments\nwere reevaluated according to Eq. ~2!, and they are given in\nthe seventh column of Table I. Positive g increases the quad-\nrupole moment, while negative g decreases it. ~We note that\nthe calculations give also a hexadecapole deformation of\nb450.03 for both bands. The obtained b2 and b4 values fit\nvery well into the systematics of the region @26,27#.!\nThe theoretical intrinsic quadrupole moment was ex-\ntracted as Q5(2Vk2qk , where qk are the single-proton quad-\nrupole moments obtained from the Woods-Saxon wave func-\ntions and Vk\n2 are the occupation probabilities. The quadrupole\nmoment Q has contributions from two spherical-tensor com-\nponents, Q5Q201Q22 . The Q20 term depends on the b2\nquadrupole deformation and it is independent of the degree\nof triaxiality. The Q22 term vanishes for axially symmetric\nnuclei, being negative for positive g and positive for nega-\ntive g deformations.\nThe theoretical and experimental quadrupole moments are\ncompared in Fig. 3. In the K51\/2 band the theoretical quad-\nrupole moment is almost constant, Q56.2 e b, without sig-\nnificant spin dependence. The experimental values extracted\nconsidering g50\u00b0 are considerably lower for all three states.\nHowever, when the theoretically predicted g515\u00b0 is used,\nthe Q values extracted from the lifetimes agree very well\nwith the theory.\nIn the case of the K57\/2 band, the predicted g deforma-\ntion, g522\u00b0, is smaller ~and with opposite sign! than for\nthe K51\/2 band. Therefore, it has a smaller effect on the\nquadrupole moment. The quadrupole moment extracted as-\nsuming axial symmetry is slightly larger than the calculated\nquadrupole moment Q5Q201Q22 with g522\u00b0, and on av-\nerage 0.4 eb higher than the Q20 term. Adopting the theo-\nretical g deformation, the Q values extracted from the ex-\nperiment again agree with the theory. As seen in Fig. 3, both\nthe experimental and theoretical quadrupole moments in-01130crease slightly with spin. ~We note that the drop in the mea-\nsured Q value at spin I521\/2 might be the effect of the\nbackbending, where there is a reduced overlap of the wave\nfunctions of the initial and final states involved.!\nWe conclude that agreement between theory and experi-\nment could only reasonably be obtained by employing devia-\ntions from axial symmetry. An overall adjustment of b2 can-\nnot give such a good agreement. The presence of two bands\nwith opposite g signs in the same nucleus shows the sensi-\ntivity to axial asymmetry. The present experiment illustrates\nthat even a small g deformation can have a measurable effect\non the quadrupole moment and this needs to be taken into\naccount if a quantitative understanding of E2 transition rates\nis to be obtained.\nThe authors thank the staff of the tandem accelerator for\nproviding a high quality beam.
