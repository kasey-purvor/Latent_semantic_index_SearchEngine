INTRODUCTION\nb-FeSi2 is a semiconductor with a band gap of\n;0.83\u20130.87 eV at room temperature1,2 ~corresponding to\nthe minimum-absorption window of silica-based fibers! mak-\ning it a potential candidate for the use in near infrared detec-\ntors and light emitters. The crystal structure of b-FeSi2 ~Ref.\n3! is base-centered orthorhombic ~space group Cmca) hav-\ning 48 atoms per unit cell and lattice parameters a\n59.863 \u00c5, b57.884 \u00c5, and c57.791 \u00c5. The unit cell\nhas two inequivalent Fe sites, each occupied by 8 atoms as\nwell as two inequivalent Si sites with 16 atoms in each. Even\nthough there is no simple lattice parameter match, epitaxial\nlayers of b-FeSi2 can be grown easily on Si~001! and\nSi~111! substrates using a variety of techniques such as, mo-\nlecular beam epitaxy,4 chemical vapor deposition,5 electron\nbeam deposition,6 and metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy.7\nBuried epilayer of the material have also been successfully\nrealized by ion beam synthesis.8 The possible compatibility\nof b-FeSi2 with standard silicon processing technology and\nits potential optoelectronic capabilities, has recently gener-\nated considerable interest in the properties of this material.\nHowever, despite the large amount of work reported in\nthe literature, the nature of the band gap of b-FeSi2 is still\ncontroversial. Ab initio calculations performed by a number\nof workers, suggested that there exists an indirect band gap a\nfew millielectron volts less than the direct one at the Y point\nin the Brillouin zone. Augmented spherical wave calcula-\ntions performed by Eppenga9 gave a direct band gap of 0.46\neV and an indirect gap of 0.44 eV. The oscillator strengths\nfor optical transitions across the gap at G were found to be\nsmall but become significant for photon energies around\n0.77 eV, which is close to the experimental band gap. From\nlinear muffin-tin orbital ~LMTO! calculations, Christensen10\nobtained a direct band gap of 0.8 eV and an indirect gap of\n;0.77 eV ~as deduced from his band diagram!. The work\nalso demonstrated the sensitivity of the states at the band\nedge to the atomic positions, as minor displacement of the Fe\natoms in the unit cell was found to lead to significant\nchanges in the calculated band gap. Full-potential linear aug-\nmented plane wave calculations carried out by Eisebitt\net al.,11 revealed a direct gap of 0.78 eV at a point of low\nsymmetry ~along the ZG line! and a slightly larger direct gap\nof 0.82 eV at the Y point. The work of Filonov et al.12 using\nthe LMTO method with different atomic sphere radii on dif-\nferent sites, showed a direct band gap of 0.74 eV. However,\ntheir experimental measurements of the absorption coeffi-\ncients of b-FeSi2 revealed the presence of both direct and\nindirect gaps and concluded that the material is a quasidirect\nsemiconductor, where the direct gap does not occur at a point\nof high symmetry. Electronic structure calculations per-\nformed by van Ek, Turchi, and Sterne13 with the LMTO\nmethod in the atomic-sphere approximation resulted in an\nindirect gap of 0.44 eV and a direct gap of 0.51 eV. A\nrecent14 LMTO calculation using the atomic-sphere approxi-\nmation again resulted in an indirect band gap of 0.44 eV\nfollowed by a slightly larger direct gap of 0.52 eV. On the\nother hand, their reflectivity measurements revealed the on-\nset of absorption only at 0.8 eV. This was attributed to a low\noscillator strength due to the d-like nature of the states in the\nregion of the direct gap.\nOnly few experimental results15,16 seem to indicate the\nexistence of an indirect transition. Photoluminescence emis-\nsion, which indicates a direct gap transition, has been re-\nported by a number of workers for b-FeSi2 layers grown by\na variety of techniques.2\u20135,17 More recently Leong et al.18\nhave successfully fabricated a light emitting device operating\nat a wavelength of 1.5 mm that incorporates b-FeSi2 into a\nconventional silicon bipolar junction, by growing a buried\nb-FeSi2 epilayer on a Si~001! substrate. One possible expla-\nnation why the experimental results generally indicate the\nexistence of a direct band gap may be related to the fact that\nthe material investigated is usually in the form of a thin film\ngrown on a silicon substrate. In this case the degree of strain\nin the film will also play an important role in the apparently\ndirect nature of the optical transitions.\nIn this paper we have calculated the electronic structures\nof bulk and strained b-FeSi2 epilayers grown on Si~001!\nsurfaces, using a plane-wave density-functional method. The\nuse of a Si~001! substrate was found to result19 in the het-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 15 OCTOBER 1998-IIVOLUME 58, NUMBER 16\nPRB 580163-1829\/98\/58~16!\/10389~5!\/$15.00 10 389 \u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society\neroepitaxial relationship b-FeSi2(100)\/S(001) with two\ntypes of lattice matching: ~A! b-FeSi2@010#iSi^110& and ~B!\nb-FeSi2@010#iSi^001&. Consequently, two strained unit cells\ncorresponding to type A and type B matching were consid-\nered. As a result of this work, we show that the type-A ori-\nentation favors a more direct band gap.\nII. DETAILS OF THE CALCULATIONS\nFor each structure of b-FeSi2 considered here we have\nperformed ab initio density-functional calculations within\nthe pseudopotential and generalized gradient approximations\n~GGA!.23 The GGA for the exchange and correlation poten-\ntial is used here in preference to the more commonly used\nlocal-density approximation ~LDA! ~Ref. 24! since it does\nnot underestimate band gaps to the same extent as the LDA.\nHowever, with both the LDA and the GGA, the trends in gap\nproperties tend to be reliable.\nWe construct the primitive unit cell and expand the va-\nlence electronic wave functions in a plane-wave basis set up\nto an energy cutoff of 560 eV, which converges the total\nenergy of the unit cell to better than 1 meV\/atom. In the\ntotal-energy calculations, integrations over the Brillouin zone\nwere performed by using a 43434 Monkhurst-Pack20 set,\nwhich gives 8 symmetrized k points, again converging total\nenergies to better than 1 meV\/atom. A preconditioned con-\njugate gradients routine25 was used to minimize the energy\nof the electronic system. Electron-ion interactions are de-\nscribed by a Qc-tuned pseudopotential22 in the Kleinman-\nBylander form.21 The Hellmann-Feynman theorem was em-\nployed to calculate the forces on the atoms and we also used\na conjugate gradients routine to relax the atomic positions.\nThe lattice parameters of the structure were also optimized\n~under the given constraints for each calculation!. When a\nplane-wave basis set is used to calculate the stresses on the\ncell, a Pulay correction is included in the stress and total\nenergy, which compensates for the changing basis set as the\nunit cell changes shape.\nFollowing the relaxation of the electronic and geometric\nstructure, the band structures of the various b-FeSi2 cells are\ncalculated. For this we use the self-consistent charge density\nobtained from the relaxation calculations to construct the\nHamiltonian of the system and diagonalize it at various\npoints in the Brillouin zone to obtain the energy eigenvalues.\nIII. STRUCTURE OF THE b-FeSi2 \/Si INTERFACES\nThe b-FeSi2(100)\/Si(001) interface exhibits two types of\nazimuthal orientations which we shall label as type A and\ntype B. The lattice parameter of Si is a55.43 \u00c5, so we\ndefine a tetragonal unit cell of the diamond structure with\ncrystal-translation vectors a8, b8, and c8 such that a85(1,\n21,0)a ~which is 7.6792 \u00c5 at 45\u00b0 to the conventional cubic\naxes! and b85(1,1,0)a . The perpendicular axis c8\n5(0,0,1)a is unchanged with respect to the original cell. It\ncan be seen that the surface unit cell in the interfacial ~001!\nplane of the new Si cell gives a good match to that of\nb-FeSi2 in the @100# plane since, for b-FeSi2 , b\n57.791 \u00c5 and c57.833 \u00c5. This gives a maximum-lattice\nmismatch of 1.8% for the b-FeSi2 @100# plane against the\nSi @001# plane in the ^110& direction where the b-FeSi2 is\nslightly compressed with respect to the bulk lattice. This is\nthe type-A heteroepitaxial relationship and is illustrated in\nFig. 1 where schematics of the b-FeSi2 and Si unit cells are\nshown at the top of the diagram. The cells are rotated by 45\u00b0\nand the b-FeSi2 cell ~dashed square! is placed on top of the\nSi cell where the top layer of atoms are indicated by the open\ncircles.\nThe second possible b-FeSi2(100)\/Si(001) interface\n~type B! lies at 45\u00b0 to the orientation of type A. This is\nshown in Fig. 2. We redefine the b-FeSi2 crystal translation\nvectors as b852b , c852c , and a85a and also for Si by\nthe tetragonal cell a853a and c85c . We can see that the\nnew surface unit cells in the interfacial planes @i.e.,\nb-FeSi2~100! and Si~001!# coincide with a maximum lattice\nmismatch of 4% where the b-FeSi2 unit cell is expanded\nalong the b and c directions. A smaller common surface unit\ncell can also be defined as shown by the dashed line in Fig.\n2, which lies at 45\u00b0 to the original cell. Since the b and c\nlattice parameters are not equal in b-FeSi2 there is also a\nsmall angular mismatch of 60.3%. Since this cell and the\none described above are equivalent, we use the smaller of\nthese in the calculations.\nWe have performed calculations on a b-FeSi2 cell, which\nis constrained to the Si lattice parameters ~since it is the\noverlayer! defined by the interfaces described above. For the\ntype-A interface, we constrained the b and c lattice param-\neters of b-FeSi2 to the experimental value for the Si sub-\nstrate, namely, 7.6792 \u00c5 @we shall refer to this as type A~I!#.\nHowever, for consistency, we also performed an identical\ncalculation at the lattice parameter a55.39 \u00c5 for Si, which\nwas determined by our ab initio calculations using the same\npseudopotential that was used in the b-FeSi2 calculations\nFIG. 1. The type-A (b-FeSi2@010#iSi^110& heteroepitaxial re-\nlationship. The top diagram shows plan views of the conventional\nBravais lattices of Si and b-FeSi2 . In the bottom diagram the top\nlayer of atoms in the Si cell are shown as open circles and a\nb-FeSi2 cell ~dashed lines! is chosen to coincide with the Si con-\nventional cell, given a p\/4 rotation around the direction perpendicu-\nlar to the substrate.\n10 390 PRB 58S. J. CLARK, H. M. AL-ALLAK, S. BRAND, AND R. A. ABRAM\n@this will be referred to as type A~II!#. For the type-B inter-\nface lattice constants, b and c , of the new constrained\nb-FeSi2 overlayer cell were made equal to the side of the Si\ncommon unit mesh, 11.5188 \u00c5.\nIn all cases the atomic positions were relaxed until the\nforces on the atoms were less than 0.001 eV\/\u00c5, which was\nconsistent with our total-energy convergence criteria. The\nlattice parameters of the bulk b-FeSi2 cell and the a lattice\nparameter of the constrained cells ~which lies perpendicular\nto the interface! were also optimized in our calculations such\nthat the uniaxial stress was less than 0.01 eV\/\u00c53, which is\nconsistent with the tolerance in the total energy of the sys-\ntem. The results of these calculations are summarized in\nTable I.\nThe structural parameters are in excellent agreement with\navailable experimental results. It can be seen that the internal\nparameters remain fairly insensitive to changes in the lattice\nparameters as the fractional coordinate varies only in the\nthird or fourth significant figure.\nIV. ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE\nFor each structure of b-FeSi2 considered here, we have\ncalculated the electronic band structure along the lines indi-\ncated in Fig. 3.

It can be seen that the material is predicted to\nbe semiconducting with an indirect band gap of 0.73 eV\nbetween the Y point in the valence band and 0.4 of the way\nalong the ZG line. This is in agreement with other ab initio\ncalculations where an indirect gap was also reported, as dis-\ncussed above.\nHowever, most experimental measurements seem to indi-\ncate that the band gap should be direct. In practice, b-FeSi2\nis commonly made on a silicon substrate, therefore a direct\ncomparison between the ab initio electronic structure calcu-\nlated from the bulk structure where all structural parameters\nare allowed to relax and these experimental results is not\nstrictly the correct comparison to make. Since the material is\nepitaxially grown on Si ~usually for use in light emitting\ndevices!, the b and c lattice parameters are constrained. We\nhave therefore also calculated the electronic structure\nb-FeSi2 for a range of constrained structures.\nFor the type-B b-FeSi2 where the b and c lattice param-\neters are expanded by approximately 4% with respect to the\nbulk case to fit the Si substrate, the band gap closes slightly\nas indicated in Fig. 5. The top valence band at the Y point\nrises in energy reducing the indirect gap to 0.53 eV and also\nreducing the direct gap at the Y point from 0.82 eV in the\nfully relaxed case to 0.62 eV. The quasidirect gap indicated\nby the dashed arrow in Fig. 5 along the ZG line remains\nrelatively unchanged at 0.83 eV.\nFor the type-A models, the b and c b-FeSi2 lattice pa-\nrameters are reduced by 1.4% and 1.8%, respectively to fit\nthe Si substrate. The principle effect of this is to lower the\nenergy of the top valence band at the Y point which signifi-\nFIG. 4. The band structure of the fully relaxed bulk structure of\nb-FeSi2 is shown along several lines of high symmetry. Arrows\nindicate the lowest-energy electronic band gaps. It can be seen\n~solid arrow! that the smallest band gap in this case is indirect\nbetween the Y point and the ZG line.\nFIG. 5. The band structure of type-B b-FeSi2 is shown here.\nThe arrows indicate the smallest direct and indirect band gaps.\nFIG. 6. ~a!

The arrows indicate\nthe smallest possible electronic band gaps, with the solid arrow\nshowing the fundamental gap in each case. It can be seen that in the\ntype-A~II! model the gap is direct whereas in type-A~I! and type-B\n~shown in Fig. 5!, the gap is indirect, similar to the bulk uncon-\nstrained material.\nFIG. 7. The top valence band and bottom conduction band for\neach structure considered is shown here. We also plot the lowest\nenergy gap for each case. It can be clearly seen that as the energy of\nthe top band at the Y decreases, it favors the quasi-direct gap along\nthe ZG line.\n10 392 PRB 58S. J. CLARK, H. M. AL-ALLAK, S. BRAND, AND R. A.

For\nthe type-A~I! model, shown in Fig. 6~a!, the direct and indi-\nrect gaps are 0.85 eV (Y point! and 0.82 eV (Y!ZG), re-\nspectively. More importantly, the difference in energy be-\ntween the smallest direct and indirect band gaps is now only\n30 meV compared to 90 meV for the bulk structure. The\ntype-A~II! model, which corresponds to the purely ab initio\nsimulation where the lattice parameter is constrained to the\nab initio Si lattice parameter as opposed to the experimental\nvalue, the trend in the energy changes of the bands continues\nin the same direction @Fig. 6~b!#. The Y point energy reduces\nfurther going below the top of the valence band along the ZG\nline giving an almost direct gap of 0.93 eV. Similar to pre-\nvious reports, we label this transition as quasidirect since it\ndoes not occur at a point of high symmetry. At the same\ntime, the direct gap at Y has opened up to 1.04 eV and the\nindirect Y!ZG gap becomes 0.98 eV.\nTo demonstrate the effect that the lattice parameter has on\nthe band gap of the material, we show the top valence bands\nand bottom conduction bands together in the same diagram\n~Fig. 7!. The arrows in the figure indicate the lowest-energy\ntransition, which is indirect from Y to ZG for the larger b and\nc cell parameters. As the unit cell is compressed the energy\nof the top valence band at Y rapidly decreases until it drops\nbelow the energy along the ZG line. At this point the transi-\ntions become quasi-direct.\nIn conclusion, we have calculated the electronic structure\nof b-FeSi2 as a function of the lattice parameters as deter-\nmined by the constraints of the substrate on which it is usu-\nally grown. We find that the electronic band gap depends\nsensitively on these parameters. The type-A material was\nfound to favor a direct band gap while type-B and also the\nbulk material results in an indirect band gap 90 meV below\nthe closest direct gap. Previous calculations on this material\ndid not include the effect of strain on the lattice parameters\nwhich results in the range of behavior that have been re-\nported. In some experimental studies of b-FeSi2 , both direct\nand indirect gaps have also been reported but, again, this will\ndepend critically on the methods used to prepare the material\nand the resultant state of strain.\n1 M.C.
