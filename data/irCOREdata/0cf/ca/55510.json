The interaction of chorus with energetic electrons produces \u223c MeV \u201ckiller\u201d\nelectrons that can disable Earth orbiting spacecraft.\nCitation: Tsurutani, B. T., R. B. Horne, J. S. Pickett, O. Santolik, D. Schriver, and O. P. Verkhoglyadova (2010), Introduction to\nthe special section on Chorus: Chorus and its role in space weather, J. Geophys. Res., 115, A00F01, doi:10.1029\/2010JA015870.\n[2] Many of the following papers are a result of the \u201cFirst\nInternational Workshop of Electromagnetic Chorus Plasma\nWaves\u201d held in La Jolla, California, 10\u201312 February 2009.\nThe many facets of this esoteric electromagnetic plasma wave\nwere discussed by active researchers in the field at the Work-\nshop. Experimentalists (both ground and satellite observations),\ncomputer modelers and theorists discussed their latest findings\nand had intense interactions with their fellow attendees.\n[3] One might ask \u201cwhy is so much effort being put into\nsuch an apparently esoteric subject\u201d? One answer is that it\nhas been speculated by the community, that chorus interacts\nresonantly with the high\u2010end tail of substorm injected\nelectrons and may produce the relativistic \u201ckiller\u201d electrons\ntrapped within the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere [Horne et al.,\n2005; Tsurutani et al., 2006]. These killer electrons appear\nin the magnetosphere during high speed solar wind streams.\nWe therefore need to know everything we can about these\nwaves to be able to properly model concomitant wave\u2010\nparticle interactions and the process of electron acceleration\nto these higher energies.\n[4] The full chain of physical processes from the Sun to the\nmagnetosphere is quite complex. It is thought that super-\ngranule circulation at the sun produces nonlinear Alfv\u00e9nwaves\nthat are carried to Earth by high speed solar wind streams (that\nemanate from coronal holes). The southward component of\nthe Alfv\u00e9n wavemagnetic fields causemagnetic reconnection\nat the Earth\u2019s dayside magnetopause. This leads to energetic\nplasma injections into the midnight sector of the magneto-\nsphere. The injection of 1\u2013100 keV anistropic electrons leads\nto a plasma instability, which then generates the chorus.\n[5] Who could possibly come up with a hypothesis that\nlong period (hrs) fluid stirrings at the surface of the sun\ncould generate relativistic electrons at a distance 1 AU\naway? Such a wild hypothesis seems beyond imagination.\nHowever, that is what the data analysis and modeling results\nseem to be implying. Thus, the effort of hundreds of inde-\npendent scientists studying the various solar, interplanetary,\nand magnetospheric physics parts of this \u201cspace weather\u201d\nchain, have given us this hypothesis to work with. It is clear\nthat no one person or small group of persons could have\nderived this complex linkage by themselves. The point that\nwe make is that independent, pure research in many diverse\nareas is essential toward the understanding of this space\nweather effect. This special section follows in this scien-\ntific tradition. Through more sophisticated instrumentation,\ntheoretical investigations and modeling, the following papers\nexpand our knowledge of chorus and are a testament for it\nbeing of fundamental importance in space plasma processes.\n[6] Acknowledgment.
