Many\naspects of these systems are now well understood. How-\never, several questions remain pertaining to the response of\nthe BEC to a sudden change in the nature of the interac-\ntions from repulsive to attractive. Resolving such questions\nis critical if a complete understanding of these basic atomic\nsystems is to be developed and if related, more complex\nphenomena, such as the formation of molecular BECs and\nsuperfluidity in degenerate Fermi systems, are to be thor-\noughly explained.\nThe macroscopic wave function of an atomic BEC obeys\na nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equation, known as the Gross-\nPitaevskii equation (GPE). The nonlinearity results from\nthe atomic interactions whose nature and magnitude are\ndescribed by the s-wave scattering length (a). Homoge-\nneous condensates in free space are inherently unstable\nwhen the interactions are attractive (a < 0). However, in a\nharmonic trapping potential, the zero-point kinetic energy\ncan stabilize the condensate provided the number of atoms\nin the BEC (N0) is less than a critical value (Ncritical)\nN0 <Ncritical \u0001 k ahojaj ; (1)\nwhere aho is the mean harmonic oscillator length which\ncharacterizes the kinetic energy in the trap, and k is a\ndimensionless constant known as the stability coefficient.\nThe exact value of k depends on the ratio of the trap\nfrequencies [1\u20133] and for our trap we have measured it\nto be k \u0001 0:46\u00026\u0003 [4].\nIn the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance, a depends\nsensitively on the magnitude of an externally applied mag-\nnetic field [5\u20137], allowing the magnitude and sign of the\natomic interactions to be tuned to any value. We have\npreviously exploited such a resonance in 85Rb to investi-\ngate the collapse of the condensate following a sudden\nchange in the nature of the interactions from repulsive to\nattractive [8]. The resulting dynamics of the imploding\n\u2018\u2018Bosenova\u2019\u2019 were both fascinating and unexpected. Most\nnotable was our observation of an anisotropic burst of\natoms that explodes from the condensate during the early\nstages of collapse, leaving behind a highly excited remnant\ncondensate that survives for many seconds. Curiously, we\nfrequently observed that the number of atoms in the rem-\nnant condensate, Nremnant, was significantly greater than\nNcritical. It was not understood why this remnant BEC did\nnot undergo further collapse until the number of atoms\nremaining was less than the value of Ncritical predicted by\nthe GPE. It was particularly puzzling that the stability\ncondition in Eq. (1) accurately predicted the onset of the\ncollapse, but did not seem consistent with number of atoms\nin the remnant. In the work presented here, we explain this\nresult by showing that the remnant is composed of multiple\nsolitons.\nSolitons are localized waves that propagate over long\ndistances without change in shape or attenuation. The\nexistence of solitonic solutions is a common feature of\nnonlinear wave equations, so that solitons appear in\nmany diverse physical systems. BEC systems described\nby the GPE can support both dark (local minima in the\ncondensate wave function) and bright (local maxima) sol-\nitons [9] depending on whether the interactions are repul-\nsive (a > 0) or attractive (a < 0), respectively. Dark\nsolitons have been observed in repulsive 87Rb condensates\n[10,11], while bright solitons have been created using one-\ndimensional (1D) 7Li condensates with attractive interac-\ntions [12,13]. Bright matter-wave solitons form when the\nattractive atomic interactions exactly balance the wave\npacket dispersion. Gap bright solitons have also been\nobserved using 87Rb condensates confined in an optical\nlattice [14]. In this Letter we show that during the collapse\nof the condensate described in [8], a robust configuration of\nmultiple solitons is created in the three-dimensional (3D)\nPRL 96, 170401 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending5 MAY 2006\n0031-9007=06=96(17)=170401(4) 170401-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\ntrap. Comparison with simulations [15] shows that, re-\nmarkably, the solitons form with relative phases such that\nthey repel each other and oscillate in the trapping potential\nfor many seconds without degradation. Since the number\nof atoms in each soliton never exceeds Ncritical and the\nrepulsive solitons never overlap, the condensate stability\ncondition is never violated.\nThe experimental apparatus and the magnetic field\nramps for probing the condensate collapse have been de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere [8,16]. Stable 85Rb condensates\nwere produced within the positive scattering length region\nof a broad Feshbach resonance by radio-frequency evapo-\nration in a magnetic trap. The radial (axial) frequency of\nthe cylindrically symmetric trap was \u0001r \u0001 17:3 Hz (\u0001z \u0001\n6:8 Hz). Condensates of up to 15 000 atoms were formed\nwith a shot-to-shot standard deviation of less than\n600 atoms. The noncondensate thermal fraction was less\nthan 500 atoms. After the evaporation at 162.2 Gauss, the\nmagnetic field was adiabatically increased to 165.5 G\nwhere a \u0001 \u00049a0 (a0 \u0001 0:0529 nm is the Bohr radius).\nThe collapse of the condensate was then induced by\nquickly switching the scattering length through zero to a\nvariable negative value acollapse by increasing the magnetic\nfield in 0.1 ms. After a variable hold time tevolve at the\nnegative scattering length, one of two imaging procedures\nwas used to interrogate the remnant condensate. In the first,\nthe scattering length was increased to a large positive value\nin order to use the large repulsive atomic interaction to\nexpand the condensate prior to the standard rapid trap\nturnoff followed by absorption imaging sequence [8].\nThis procedure ensured that the size of the condensate\nwas well above the resolution limit of the imaging system\n[7 \u0002m full width at half maximum (FWHM)], allowing the\nnumber of atoms to be measured reliably. In the second, the\nmagnetic trap was turned off immediately and the conden-\nsate imaged with minimum delay (\u00052 ms), effectively\nprobing the remnant condensate without any expansion.\nThe number of condensate atoms surviving the collapse\nwas investigated as a function of both acollapse and the\ninitial population of the condensate. The hold time at\nacollapse was sufficiently long (tevolve \u0001 50 ms) to ensure\nthat all collapse-related atom loss had ceased [8]. The\nresults are plotted in Fig. 1 as the ratio of the remnant\nnumber to the critical number [calculated using Eq. (1)].\nDepending upon the conditions of the collapse, Nremnant\nvaried from below the critical number to much greater than\nthe critical number (for acollapse \u0001 \u0006100a0, the remnant\ncondensate contained approximately 10\u0007 the critical num-\nber of atoms). Interestingly, the fraction of atoms surviving\nthe collapse depends only on acollapse and is independent of\nthe initial number of condensate atoms (in the range in-\nvestigated). This fraction varies smoothly from \u000560% for\nacollapse \u2019 \u00065a0 to \u000530% for acollapse \u2019 \u000650a0. The life-\ntime of the remnant condensate at acollapse was several\nseconds and comparable to the lifetime of a condensate\nfor small positive scattering lengths, even for Nremnant >\nNcritical.\nIn a separate set of experiments, the evolution of the size\nand shape of the unexpanded remnant condensate was\ninvestigated. From the images, the axial and radial column\ndensity distributions were calculated and fitted with\nGaussian profiles to obtain both the axial and radial\nFWHM. The result of this analysis is shown for the\n(weaker) axial direction in Fig. 2(a). Any variation in the\nwidth of the remnant condensate in the radial direction was\nbelow the resolution limit of our imaging system. The\nremnant condensate is highly excited, with the variation\nin the axial width being well fitted by sinusoidal oscilla-\ntions at the two lowest collective mode frequencies (\u00011 \u0001\n2\u0001z and \u00012 \u0001 2\u0001r). The measured frequencies were \u00011 \u0001\n13:67\u00021\u0003 Hz and \u00012 \u0001 33:44\u00023\u0003 Hz. The amplitude of the\n\u00012 oscillation was 29(7)% of that of the \u00011 oscillation and\ncontained a significant contribution from the radial focus\nof the atom burst associated with the collapse [8]. There\nwas no discernible damping during our 3 s observation\ntime.\nClose inspection of the images, however, reveals that the\nvariation in the width is not due to the excitation of\ncollective modes. The remnant condensate is observed to\nseparate into two (or more) distinct clouds which we\nassociate with solitons [Figs. 2(b)\u20132(d)]. The observed\noscillation in the axial width of the remnant then results\nfrom the oscillation of two solitons along the axial direc-\ntion of the trap. The solitons persist for over three seconds\n[Fig. 2(d)] with only a small degradation in the quality of\nthe images due to the presence of more thermal atoms as\nthe condensate melts. The solitons collide over 40 times\nduring this period. The remarkable stability of the soliton\ndynamics in the 3D trap, leads us to conclude that neigh-\n| acollapse |  (a0)\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 30 40 50 6010\nN\nre\nm\nn\na\nn\nt \/\n N\ncr\niti\nca\nl\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nN0 = 15000\nN0 = 10000\nN0 = 5000\nFIG. 1.

In\nthis case, the solitons do not pass through each other at the\ncenter of the trap, but rather rebound off one another.\nConsequently, as the solitons never fully overlap, the criti-\ncal density for collapse is never reached and the solitons\nremain stable. This conclusion is supported by simulations\nof our experiment based on a numerical integration of the\n3D GPE, which show that multiple solitons are only stable\nprovided they interact repulsively [15]. Similar results\nwere observed for the soliton trains created in the 7Li\nexperiments [12].\nThe number of solitons that forms depends both on the\ninitial number of condensate atoms and the magnitude of\nacollapse. In Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) we present images and cross\nsections showing two and three solitons, respectively.\nThese images were acquired with tevolve \u0001 200 ms, when\nthe axial width was a maximum and the solitons were\nmaximally separated. For comparison, Fig. 3(a) shows a\nremnant condensate for which Nremnant <Ncritical. Under\nthese conditions the remnant was never observed to sepa-\nrate into two or more solitons. We have observed up to six\nsolitons form [Fig. 3(d)]. However, the quality of the\nimages was significantly reduced when more than three\nsolitons formed because the spacing between solitons be-\ncame comparable to the imaging resolution limit. In\nFig. 3(c) the three solitons contain approximately the\nsame number of atoms. This was not always the case,\nhowever, and we often observed an unequal yet (usually)\nsymmetric population distribution across the solitons.\nIn Fig. 4 we examine in more detail the conditions under\nwhich multiple solitons form. For a fixed initial number\nof atoms in the condensate (N0 \b 8000), the number of\nsolitons created was investigated as a function of acollapse.\nThe images were again acquired with tevolve \u0001 200 ms.\nIn Fig. 4(a) the modal number of solitons is plotted.\nThe data show a gradual increase in the number of solitons\nas the magnitude of acollapse increases. The ratio\nNremnant=Ncritical for the same N0 is also plotted in\nFig. 4(a). This ratio exhibits the same trend as a function\nof acollapse as the observed number of solitons. Most im-\nportantly, it never exceeds the number of solitons. From\nthis observation we deduce that the number of atoms in\neach soliton is always less than or equal to Ncritical. Each\nsoliton is therefore stable against collapse, explaining the\nunexpected stability of remnant condensates for which\nNremnant >Ncritical. This point is emphasized in Fig. 4(b)\nwhere the ratio Nremnant=Ncritical is plotted against the ob-\nserved mean number of solitons.

(1) (dashed\nline).\nIn contrast to the previous observations of bright solitons\nin 1D confining potentials [12,13], these experiments were\nperformed in a 3D trap with an aspect ratio of \u0001r=\u0001z \b 2:5.\nUnder such conditions, 3D bright solitons are predicted to\nbe stable only if the attractive atomic interaction is smaller\nthan a critical value [18], consistent with our observations.\nMoreover, the remarkable stability of multiple solitons in\nour 3D trap indicates that neighboring solitons form with a\nrelative phase that ensures they interact repulsively.\nAttractive interactions between the solitons would lead to\nenergetic excitations of the soliton wave function during\neach \u2018\u2018collision\u2019\u2019 (in this case the solitons pass through one\nanother), and ultimately a loss of particles from the BEC\n[15]. To our knowledge, there is no definitive physical\npicture of the origin of the relative phase that ensures the\nstability of the multiple soliton states. Several authors\npropose that bright matter-wave solitons form due to a\nmodulation instability of the condensate wave function\n[19\u201321], whereby the attractive nonlinearity leads to the\ngrowth of perturbations on a scale of the order of the\ncondensate healing length. A sequence of localized collap-\nses follows, such that the density and phase of the conden-\nsate evolves to \u2018\u2018find\u2019\u2019 a stable arrangement of solitons. We\nnote that our previous observations of local \u2018\u2018spikes\u2019\u2019 in the\ncondensate density [8] are consistent with this mechanism.\nThe sudden change in the nature of the atomic interac-\ntions in a Bose-Einstein condensate from repulsive to\nattractive leads to a violent collapse process, in which a\nsignificant proportion of the initial condensate is ejected in\na highly energetic burst. Yet, surprisingly, out of this\nviolent explosion emerges a robust configuration of soli-\ntons that preserves a large fraction of the initial condensate\npopulation. It is particularly striking that this behavior\nholds over a large range of attractive interaction strengths\nand that the solitons may undergo many collisions, even in\na 3D potential, while remaining stable.\nWe thank N.

(a) The modal number of solitons (\u0004) observed after\n200 ms of evolution at the collapse field as a function of the\nmagnitude of the negative scattering (acollapse). The ratio of the\nnumber of remnant condensate atoms to the critical number (\u0001)\nis also plotted on the right axis (note the two y axes have the\nsame scale). The initial condensate contained approximately\n8000 atoms. (b) The ratio of the number of remnant condensate\natoms to the critical number is plotted against the mean number\nof observed solitons to show that each soliton contains less than\nthe critical number of atoms defined by Eq. (1) and is therefore\nexpected to be stable. The error bars represent the statistical\nspread in the data only.\nPRL 96, 170401 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending5 MAY 2006\n170401-4\n"}
