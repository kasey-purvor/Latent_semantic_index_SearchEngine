Dewar and Malcolm J. Joyce\nAbstract\u2014The viscosity of non-solid foods, and the stability\nof their viscosity over time, temperature change and shearing\nis critical in managing dysphagia. The starch-based foodstuffs\nthickeners used in dysphagia therapy are highly non-Newtonian\nand their viscosity is dependent on shear rate, shear history,\ntemperature and time. This inherently results in the subjec-\ntive measurement of viscosity and hence the management of\ndysphagia to be error prone. Given the ageing population,\nthis problem is likely to become more widespread. This paper\nidentifies the need for an objective measurement device rather\nthan the current subjective methods. The use of the quartz\ncrystal microbalance (QCM) as a viscometer for the starch-\nbased thickeners is reported.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDysphagia is a common, but relatively short-lived sequelae\nof a cerebrovascular accident and can occur on a chronic\nbasis in many neuro-degenerative diseases. Dysphagia that\nis present immediately following a stroke is found to resolve\nin half of all patients. The small group of patients for\nwhom dysphagia persists for more than three weeks generally\nhave a less favourable outcome [1]. The condition occurs\nin as many as 60% of stroke patients [2] and can lead\nto dehydration, malnutrition and, most notably, pulmonary\naspiration [3], [4]. Aspiration aids the transport of pathogenic\nbacteria into the lungs and can lead to aspiration pneumonia\n[5], [6]. Numerous respiratory problems have been related\nto aspiration [7]. Dysphagic stroke patients have difficulty\nswallowing fluids and often have their fluids thickened with\na starch-based thickener as part of prescribed therapy.\nOn a clinical basis the thickened fluid\u2019s viscosity is often\njudged subjectively and monitored using terms such as syrup\nor honey. It is vital that drinks of the correct viscosity are\nprepared consistently, as too low a viscosity may travel\nfaster into the pharynx and be more likely to enter the\nairway before protective mechanisms of the swallow can be\ninitiated. Too high a viscosity is rejected by patients and can\nlead to malnutrition and dehydration. For some patients a\nhigh viscosity and hence increased transit time increases the\nlikelihood of aspiration. Miller and Watkin [8] and Goulding\nand Bakheit [9] illustrated that a high viscosity fluid can\naggravate swallowing and may worsen dysphagia. Therefore\nit is clear that the viscosity must be precise, as too low\nviscosity causes harm to health and too high viscosity is\nrejected and in some cases also causes harm. These problems\nThis work was funded by the EPSRC\nR. J. Dewar and M. J. Joyce are with the Engineering Department,\nLancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YR, UK.\nr.dewar1@lancaster.ac.uk\nm.joyce@lancaster.ac.uk\nare exacerbated by the complexity of the viscosity of the\nstarch fluids. We have recently illustrated that the starch-\nbased foodstuffs thickeners used in dysphagia therapy are\nhighly non-Newtonian and their viscosity is dependent on\nshear rate, shear history, and time [10].\nIt has been shown using an electromyograph (EMG),\nmanometry and videofluoroscopy techniques [11]-[14] that\nfluids with increased viscosity have increased transit times\nduring the swallow due to the increased oropharyngeal\nmuscle activity. Higher viscosity fluids allow more time for\nthe patient to trigger the swallowing reflex [15]. Therefore\nduring a swallowing analysis, such as a videofluoroscopy, the\ncorrect viscosity of any liquids consumed by a patient can be\ndetermined. However, since it is impractical and expensive\nto use a viscometer or rheometer at the bedside, the fluids\ncan only be judged subjectively by the carer or patient.\nThe expensive instrumentation and skilled therapists using\nthe videofluoroscopy or EMG are partly redundant since the\ncorrect viscosity determined by these techniques cannot be\nquantified to the desired precision at the bedside.\nViscosity measurements are generally taken using cap-\nillary viscometers, falling-ball viscometers, rotational vis-\ncometers or oscillatory rheometers. These often involve time\nconsuming and expensive processes and are clearly not\npractical at the bedside. The QCM has been used to probe\nthe viscous properties of fluids in many applications [16]-\n[23]. The QCM is a viable cheap and practical alternative to\na benchtop viscometer and it has a less disturbed and more\nlinear response when compared to conventional viscometers\n[24]. Recently we have illustrated the practicality of the\nQCM, in that it can be used numerous times with gentle\ncleaning when used with starch thickeners [25].\nInitially quartz crystals were used as sensitive deposition\nmonitors, after Sauerbrey [26] derived a relationship between\nthe mass applied (foreign layers deposited on crystal) and the\nconsequent change in resonant frequency.\n\u2206f =\n\u22122f0\u2206m\nA\n\u221a\n\u03c1q\u00b5q\n(1)\nwhere \u2206f is the change in frequency, f 0 is the fundamental\nresonant frequency of the crystal, \u2206m the mass change, A\nthe piezoelectrically active area, \u03c1q the density of quartz, and\n\u00b5q the shear modulus.\nRecently the QCM has been used to probe the viscous\nproperties of liquids.

Our work\nestablishes a novel fluid application technique and aims to\nexamine some of the practical aspects of using the QCM\n[25]. It is our aim to increase its potential as a commer-\ncial medical viscometer, not only specifically for dysphagia\ntherapy but as a general medical aid.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe aim of this work was to examine the QCM response\nfor the starch thickeners used in dysphagia therapy and to de-\ntermine any problems associated with measurement. We have\npreviously only observed changes in resonant frequency. This\nwork includes changes in Q. Ideally this work will highlight\nissues regarding bringing the QCM out of the laboratory\nand into hospitals as a reliable medical instrument. The\nexperiments used a starch (modified maize) thickener that\nis popular in health care, both in its current form and post\ngelatinisation1. For each sample application a measurement\nof the change in Q (\u2206Q) and resonant frequency (\u2206f ) was\nrecorded for both the fundamental and third harmonic.\nA. Solution preparation\nEach solution was made by adding 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or 3\ngrammes (\u00b10.0005g) of a commercial thickener based solely\non modified maize starch, to 50ml (\u00b10.08ml) of deionised\nwater. Throughout this paper, \u2018concentration\u2019 refers to the\nnumber of grammes in 50ml of water. All solutions were\nmade by mixing the powdered starch into the water for 30 s\nat an approximate shear rate of 50 s\u22121 at room temperature\n(24-24.5\u25e6C). The solutions were allowed to stand for 5 min\nbefore being stirred at a similar shear rate for 30 s. The\nsample was allowed to stand for a further 2 min before being\nstirred again and applied to the QCM. For the gelatinisation\nexperiments the samples were made in a similar way, after\nbeing heated to 90\u25e6C for 10 min.\nLeaving a starch-based fluid to stand allows the formation\nof a gel network [29], [30], therefore the gel was agitated\nto breakdown the structure and return the fluid to a sol by\ngentle swirling before each droplet application.\nB. Sample application\nQuartz crystals of resonant frequency 10 MHz (supplied\nby C-MAC, Somerset, UK), were driven and monitored\n1Gelatinisation is the process that happens to starch fluids when heated.\nThe heat causes the hydrogen bonds to break and the starch granules to\nswell. When the kinetic energy of the water molecules becomes sufficient\nto overcome the attraction between the hydrogen-bonded starch molecules\nwithin the granule, water molecules can penetrate the starch granules causing\nthe granules to swell.\nFig. 1. Schematic of sample application to QCM.\nby a Hewlett-Packard 8753E network analyser. The crys-\ntals degree of polish was characterised by C-MAC by the\namount of material removed. The crystals used in these\nexperiments were polished to the degree of 2\u00b5m removed. A\nmore rigorous characterisation for the surface roughness was\nobtained by the use of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)\nin the Physics department at Lancaster and was found to be\n27\u00b15nm RMS. The application of the droplet to the QCM\nsurface can be seen in figure 1. Approximately 0.5mm3 of\nthe sample was applied to one surface of the crystal using a\npipette. This produced a sessile droplet covering the entire\nelectrode but not extending to the edges where shorting\nof the electrodes could occur through conductance of the\nsample. The same side of the crystal was used throughout\nthe experiments. This technique is unique to Lancaster and\nallows only small amounts of sample to be used [31].\nC. Cleaning procedure and measurements\nThe resonant frequency for the fundamental and third\nharmonic was recorded before application of the sample\n(unloaded data). \u2206f was recorded once the sample was\napplied for both harmonics (loaded data). In addition the Q\nwas recorded before and during droplet application for both\nharmonics. Cleaning of the crystal was performed by holding\nthe QCM in a stream of 60-70oC tap water for 30 s. Excess\nwater was shaken off and the crystal was placed in a stream\nof hot air (\u224860oC) for 30 s to speed up evaporation. The\ncrystal was connected to the network analyser and allowed\nto equilibrate for 10 min before the next sample was applied.\nWe have previously verified the efficacy of this technique\n[25].\nIII. RESULTS\nA. First Harmonic\nFigure 2(a) illustrates the change in Q at the funda-\nmental frequency when the crystal is loaded by varying\nconcentrations of starch thickeners. The error bars represent\none standard deviation from the mean. Although there does\nseem to be a small linear decrease in \u2206Q as concentration\nincreases, it is clear from the error bars alone that the\nsamples do not significantly differ and a Analysis of Variance\n(ANOVA) test is not necessary. The gelatinised starch results\n(Figure 5(a)) however suggest that there may be a general\nlinear decrease in \u2206Q. Figure 3(a) shows how the QCM\nfundamental frequency changes with increasing starch con-\ncentration. Since the error bars overlap less than figure 2(a),\nit is necessary to perform an ANOVA multiple range test\n2512\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The response appears to be non linear\nyet more variable than the first harmonic equivalent. The\ngelatinisation results follow a similar pattern (figure 5(b)).\nThis suggests that Q is less linear and appropriate as a\n(a) Fundamental frequency\n(b) Third harmonic\nFig. 3.

Table I indicates\nwhich samples are significantly different using the ANOVA\nmultiple range test and indicates that more of the samples\nare significantly different than the fundamental frequency\nequivalent. The gelatinisation multiple range test results\nindicate that only the 0.5g sample is significantly different\nand the remaining samples are not.\nFigure 6 shows the QCM\u2019s viscosity response and illus-\ntrates that although there is a consistent linear relationship\nbetween concentration and viscosity, it is far from the actual\nviscosity values for the starch fluids.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nFigures 2(a), 3(a), 2(b) and 3(b) indicate that there is a\nsmall measurable response when the QCM is used to detect\nthe viscosity of starch samples. The figures also show that\nthe third harmonic is more sensitive to changes in the starch\nconcentration. Figure 6 suggests that the QCM response is\ntoo small and wholly inaccurate when compared with actual\nviscosity values of the starch solutions. This is surprising\nsince our prior-art has demonstrated good correspondence\nwith the viscosity of continuous phase fluids [21], [22].\nA possible explanation for this is that starch is insoluble\nin water at room temperature.

These two polysaccha-\nrides associate via hydrogen bonds either directly or through\nhydrate bridges, forming semi-crystalline micelles that ex-\nhibit birefringence and consequently yield amorphous areas\n[32]. These semi-crystalline regions are insoluble and are\ncomposed mainly of short chains of branched amylopectin\narranged in a three-dimensional lattice through a double-\nhelix formation [33]. The amorphous regions are composed\nof amylose molecules in a single-stranded helix formation.\nThese regions undergo water imbibition [33]. Therefore,\na starch gel can be regarded as a composite material, in\nwhich the continuous phase of the amylose gel matrix\nhas swollen gelatinized granules made up of amylopectin\ndistributed within it [34], [35]. The rheological properties of\nthe continuous phase and the deformability of the dispersed\nphase, and the interactions between these two phases are\nassociated with the mechanical properties of starch gels [34].\nThe QCM is possibly only responding to the continuous\nphase and is unaffected by the starch grains in the dispersed\nphase. Therefore since maize has a large constituent of\ninsoluble amylopectin, the increasing starch concentration is\nhaving a minimal effect on the QCM response. Gelatinised\nstarch should then however cause a vast increase in accuracy\nand precision. Given the gelatinised starch results, this is\nnot the case. The gelatinised starch results actually appear\nless precise and more erroreous than the non-gelatinised\nequivalent.\nV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS\nA. Conclusions\nWe have highlighted the need and possible solution for a\nmuch reputed problem within dysphagia therapy. Given the\nageing population, this problem is likely to become more\nevident and a solution is sorely needed. This work currently\nsuggests that the viscosity of normal maize starch solutions is\nnot able to be accurately quantified using the QCM. Further\nexperiments have shown that gelatinisation will not improve\nthe QCM response. The results suggest a trend, that a high\n2514\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library. Downloaded on December 9, 2008 at 09:16 from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply.\nfundamental frequency QCM (\u224815-20MHz) driven at the\nthird or fifth harmonic may have sufficient sensitivity to\naccurately characterise the viscosity of starch fluids used in\ndysphagia therapy using \u2206f. The converse is true for Q. \u2206Q\nbecomes less consistent and accurate at higher harmonics.\nUse of an accurate microviscometer is likely to improve\ntherapy as the inevitable ambiguity of subjective analysis\ncan be avoided.\nB. Future Works\nThere is an obvious need for a cheap practical viscometer\nthroughout the health care profession, ranging from dyspha-\ngia therapy where the fluids to be consumed are measured\nto the measurement of bodily fluids such as various blood\nanalyses. Such complex non-Newtonian fluids require a\nsensitive device to determine viscosity. A high frequency\nQCM driven at a high harmonic may meet the criteria and\nenable a portable microviscometer to be used throughout the\nhealthcare profession.\nVI.
