We find that the matrix\nelements computed in field theory and the corresponding string amplitudes derived from\nthe three-string vertex are, in all cases, in perfect agreement.\n1 Introduction\nIn [1], Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase (BMN) proposed an intriguing correspondence\nbetween type IIB superstring theory on a pp-wave background geometry and a sector of\nN = 4 Super Yang-Mills (SYM). BMN compared the exact expression [2] for the mass\nspectrum of the string states in free string theory, gst = 0, to the planar anomalous\ndimension of certain field theory operators - since then called the BMN operators - to\nthe first order in the \u2019t Hooft coupling of the theory \u03bb\u2032, finding remarkable agreement.\nShortly after it was shown in [3] that, thanks to the superconformal invariance of the\nN = 4 theory, it was actually possible to reproduce from field theory the full (all orders\nin \u03bb\u2032) expression for the masses of string states at gst = 0. An important step forward\nwas subsequently taken in [4, 5], where the correspondence was expressed as [5]\n1\n\u00b5\nHstring = \u2206\u2212 J , (1.1)\nwhere Hstring is the interacting string Hamiltonian, \u00b5 is the scale parameter of the pp-\nwave metric, and \u2206\u2212 J is the difference between the gauge theory dilatation operator \u2206\nand the R-charge J . The relation (1.1) is conjectured to hold in the double-scaling limit\nN \u223c J2 \u2192\u221e to all orders in the two parameters of the theory, g2 and \u03bb\u2032, where\n\u03bb\u2032 =\ng2YMN\nJ2\n=\n1\n(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2\n, (1.2)\ng2 =\nJ2\nN\n= 4\u03c0 gst (\u00b5p\n+\u03b1\u2032)2 . (1.3)\nHere \u03bb\u2032 is the effective \u2019t Hooft coupling of the BMN sector [1], and g2 is the genus\ncounting parameter of Feynman diagrams [1, 6, 7]. The right hand sides of (1.2), (1.3)\nexpress \u03bb\u2032 and g2 in terms of the parameters in pp-wave string theory, so that 1\/\u03bb\n\u2032 \u221d \u00b5\nmeasures the deviation from flat space \u00b5 \u2192 0 and, importantly, the Yang-Mills genus\ncounting parameter g2 is proportional to the string coupling gst.\nTests of the relation (1.1) rely on the careful comparison of string amplitudes obtained\nin pp-wave string field theory to the matrix elements of the dilatation operator \u2206 in Yang-\nMills, and have been performed, for the bosonic sector of the theory, in a variety of cases:\na. in [8], the case of BMN operators with two scalar impurities of different flavour was\nstudied;\nb. in [9,10], BMN operators with an arbitrary number of scalar impurities was consid-\nered; and finally,\nc. in [10], all the SO(4)\u00d7SO(4) representations of two scalar impurity and two vector\nimpurity BMN operators were studied, as well as BMN operators with mixed (one\nscalar\/one vector) impurities.\n1\nIn all cases, precise agreement was found between the string amplitudes obtained using\nthe superstring vertex1 and the corresponding matrix elements obtained in field theory\n[8\u201310]. In particular, the analysis of [10] clarified a puzzle concerning the realisation of the\nZ2 \u2282 SO(8) symmetry of the pp-wave background geometry.2 Apparently, the Z2 part\nof the bosonic symmetry of the pp-wave background is not respected by the Spradlin-\nVolovich three-string interactions [12, 15\u201318]: a relative minus sign appears in the string\namplitude involving states with two oscillators along the first SO(4) compared to that\nwith two oscillators along the second SO(4). However, the string vertex is invariant under\nZ2, and the puzzle is solved, if one makes the parity assignment under the Z2 symmetry:\n|0\u3009 \u2192 |0\u3009, |v\u3009 \u2192 \u2212|v\u3009, where |v\u3009 is the true ground state of the pp-wave theory, whereas\n|0\u3009 is the string state corresponding to the ground state for flat background (but not for\n\u00b5 6= 0, where its energy is proportional to \u00b5). In [10], the emergence of the previous parity\nassignment was explicitly shown in field theory.\nAn important point should now be emphasised. In order to use and in particular to\ntest (1.1) at the level of matrix elements, it is essential to construct the isomorphism\nwhich connects the basis of states on which the string theory Hamiltonian acts to the\ncorresponding basis of field theory operators. Lightcone string field theory is naturally\nequipped with an orthonormal basis of single- and multi-string states, which does not\ncorrespond to either the \u201cnatural\u201d basis in field theory, i.e. the basis of operators with\nwell-defined conformal dimension (henceforth called the \u2206-BMN basis), or to the basis\noriginally considered by BMN. This subtle issue required some time to be appreciated and\nfully understood [5,8,19], but the isomorphism was finally constructed and used in [8\u201310]\nto successfully test the correspondence. Specifically, in [10] the natural emergence of the\nisomorphic to string basis was explained by constructing the proper overlap of states in\nterms of two-point function of BMN operators where the conjugated BMN operator is\ndefined through hermitian conjugation plus an inversion [20]. This procedure, which was\napplied in [10] to BMN operators with scalar and\/or vector impurities, will be used in\nsection 3 in the case of fermion BMN operators.\nFermion BMN operators have recently been studied, with an emphasis on mixing\nissues, in [21, 22], however the equivalence relation (1.1) has not been investigated so far\nin the fermionic part of the BMN sector of N = 4 Yang-Mills. The aim of this paper is to\nfill this important gap. One of the main motivations for our analysis lies in the fact that\nfermionic matrix elements of Hstring have never been compared to any field theory result.\nMoreover, string field theory in the fermionic sector is not just a simple extension of its\nbosonic counterpart, and the construction of the fermionic prefactor of the string field\nHamiltonian is not straightforward. Therefore, it is particularly compelling to investigate\nthe BMN correspondence in the fermionic sector.\n1The expression for this vertex was originally obtained by Spradlin and Volovich [11, 12], and further\nstudied and clarified by Pankiewicz and Stefanski in [13, 14].\n2The presence of a five-form flux in the pp-wave background breaks the lightcone SO(8) symmetry\ndown to SO(4)\u00d7SO(4)\u00d7Z2. The first (second) SO(4) rotates the first (last) four directions {xi} ({xa}),\nwhile the Z2 symmetry swaps {xi} \u2192 {xa}.\n2\nIn this paper we will make use of the superstring vertex in the SO(4)\u00d7SO(4) formal-\nism, whose construction was given in [23]. It was shown in [24] that the SO(8) formalism\nof [11\u201314] is actually completely equivalent to the SO(4)\u00d7 SO(4) construction, as it was\nalready conjectured in [23]. The SO(8) and the SO(4)\u00d7 SO(4) formalism differ in that,\nin the former, the string interaction vertex is built upon the state |0\u3009 (the ground state\nof the theory in flat background); whereas in the latter, the vertex is constructed on the\ntrue pp-wave ground state |v\u3009. In both formalisms the external string states are built on\nthe true pp-wave ground state |v\u3009.\nOur analysis in field theory will be performed up to and including O(\u03bb\u2032) in the pp-wave\n\u2019t Hooft coupling and O(g2) in the genus counting parameter, and hence incorporates\nstring interactions at the first nontrivial order.3 Our result is simple: for all cases we\nconsider, the matrix elements of the string field theory Hamiltonian derived from the\nsuperstring vertex of [11, 12, 14, 23] agree perfectly with the corresponding field theory\nquantities. This result allows us to confirm the validity of the conjectured duality relation\n(1.1) in the fermionic sector, and at the level of string interactions.\nThe plan of the rest of this paper is as follows. In the next section we introduce and\ndiscuss BMN operators with two fermion impurities. In section 3, we review in detail the\nprocedure which leads to the identification of the basis in field theory which is isomor-\nphic to the natural string basis of single- and multi-string states. We also summarise the\nstrategy we follow in order to compare the matrix elements of the Yang-Mills dilatation\noperator to the matrix elements of the interacting string Hamiltonian \u2013 with particular\nattention to the new features arising from considering fermion BMN operators. In section\n4 we derive the desired fermionic matrix elements of the string Hamiltonian in light-\ncone string field theory. Section 5 and 6 contain the calculation in field theory and the\ncomparison to the string results previously derived. We conclude with a few appendices\ncontaining details of the calculations, as well as our notation and conventions in field and\nstring theory.\n2 Fermion BMN operators\nIn order to study the BMN sector of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills, we need to pick an R-\ncharge subgroup U(1)J \u2282 SU(4). Hence we need to decompose SU(4)\u2192 SO(4)\u00d7U(1)J \u223c\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)\u00d7 U(1)J . The branching rule for the fermion representation 4 of SU(4),\nto which the fermions \u03bbA\u03b1 of the N = 4 theory belong, is [27]\n4 \u2212\u2192 (2, 1)+ + (1, 2)\u2212 , (2.1)\n3This result, as well as the results of [8\u201310,25] are in contradistinction with [26], where it was argued\nthat nonplanar effects (corresponding to string interactions in string theory) should not be incorporated\ninto the pp-wave string theory\/N = 4 SYM duality.\n3\nfrom which we have, in terms of fields,\n\u03bbA\u03b1 \u2212\u2192\n(\n\u03bbr\u03b1, (1\/2) , \u03bbr\u02d9\u03b1, (\u22121\/2)\n)\n, (2.2)\n\u03bb\u00afA\u03b1\u02d9 \u2212\u2192\n(\n\u03bb\u00afr\u03b1\u02d9, (\u22121\/2) , \u03bb\u00afr\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9, (1\/2)\n)\n. (2.3)\nHere \u03b1, \u03b1\u02d9 = 1, 2 are spin indices, A = 1 . . . 4, and r = 3, 4, r\u02d9 = 1, 2. Notice that there\nare four fermions with positive R-charge, \u03bbr\u03b1, (1\/2) and \u03bb\u00afr\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9, (1\/2), and four with negative\nR-charge, \u03bbr\u02d9\u03b1, (\u22121\/2), \u03bb\u00afr\u03b1\u02d9, (\u22121\/2). We will refer to the former as to the BMN fermions, and\nto the latter as to the anti-BMN fermions. To simplify the notation, we will omit from\nnow on the U(1) R-charge subscript in the fermion fields.\nThe following table summarises the field content (scalar, vector and fermion fields)\nof the N = 4 SYM theory participating in the BMN correspondence, together with\ntheir canonical dimensions, R-charge and decomposition into irreducible representations\nof SO(4)\u00d7 SO(4) \u223c SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2).\nfield \u22060 J \u22060 \u2212 J SO(4)\u00d7 SO(4)\nZ 1 1 0 (1, 1)\nZ\u00af 1 -1 2 (1, 1)\n\u03c6i 1 0 1 (1, 4)\nD\u00b5 1 0 1 (4, 1)\n\u03bbr\u03b1 3\/2 1\/2 1 ((2, 1), (2, 1))\n\u03bb\u00afr\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9 3\/2 1\/2 1 ((1, 2), (1, 2))\n\u03bb\u00afr\u03b1\u02d9 3\/2 -1\/2 2 ((2, 1), (1, 2))\n\u03bbr\u02d9\u03b1 3\/2 -1\/2 2 ((1, 2), (2, 1))\nTable 1: In this table we list the canonical dimension \u22060, R-charge J and SO(4)\u00d7SO(4)\nrepresentations for the fields of N = 4 Super Yang-Mills. For convenience, we also write\nthe corresponding \u22060 \u2212 J for each field.\nWe now discuss the two-impurity fermion BMN operators. Their precise form can be\nobtained by acting with two supersymmetry transformations on the scalar BMN operators\nOJij,m = C\n[ J\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr\n(\n\u03c6iZ\nl\u03c6jZ\nJ\u2212l\n) \u2212 \u03b4ij Tr(Z\u00afZJ+1)] , (2.4)\nwhere i, j = 1, . . . , 4 and we have defined\nC := 1\u221a\nJNJ+20\n, N0 :=\ng2\n2\nN\n4\u03c02\n. (2.5)\nThe normalisation of the operators is such that their two-point functions take the canoni-\ncal form in the planar limit. This procedure correctly identifies the possible compensating\n4\nterms which may be present in the expression of the operators. We would like to remind\nthe reader that these compensating terms are crucial for a correct understanding of the\ndynamics of the BMN sector.\nSpecifically, we will be considering\nOJvac =\n1\u221a\nJNJ0\nTrZJ , (2.6)\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J33;m =\nC\n2\n[ J\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr(\u03bb\u03b13 Z\nl \u03bb\u03b23 Z\nJ\u2212l)\n]\n, (2.7)\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J34;m =\nC\n2\n[ J\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr(\u03bb\u03b13 Z\nl \u03bb\u03b24 Z\nJ\u2212l) \u2212\n\u221a\n2\n4\nTr\n(\n(F\u00b5\u03bd\u03c3\n\u00b5\u03bd) \u03b2\u03b3 \u01eb\n\u03b1\u03b3 ZJ+1\n)]\n. (2.8)\nVery similar expressions can be written for operators where (3, 4)\u2192 (1, 2), i.e. undotted\nSU(2) indices are replaced by dotted ones.\nIn the following, we will also make extensive use of the expressions for the double-trace\noperators\nT J,yr\u03b1,s\u03b2;m = : Oy\u00b7Jr\u03b1,s\u03b2;m : : O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac : , (2.9)\nT J,y\nr\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9,s\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9;m\n= : Oy\u00b7J\nr\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9,s\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9;m\n: : O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac : , (2.10)\nwhere y \u2208 (0, 1).\nA few important comments are in order.\n1. First, note the appearance on right hand side of (2.8) of an all-important compen-\nsating term which modifies the na\u00a8\u0131ve expression for O\u03b1\u03b2;J34;m. Compensating terms are\nrequired in order for the corresponding operators to be conformal primaries in the\nBMN limit, and are present also in the case of scalar BMN operators [28] (as the\nright hand side of (2.4) for i = j shows) and vector BMN operators [29, 30].\n2. Second, we would like to stress that these compensating terms play a key ro\u02c6le in\nthe evaluation of the conformal three-point functions of vector and mixed BMN\noperators. Indeed, had they not been taken into account, one would erroneously\nconclude that the three-point functions for scalar, vector and mixed BMN operators\ntake actually all the same form. The three-point function coefficients for vector and\nfor mixed BMN operators were computed in [20] and [10], respectively, and found\nto be different from that of the scalar case [31].4 Of course, this is striking evidence\nagainst a direct correspondence between the conformal three-point functions and the\nsuperstring vertex at the nontrivial, interacting level.\n4Their expressions are given in Eqs. (3.29)-(3.31) of [10].\n5\n3. Furthermore, the analysis of [10] showed that precisely thanks to the differences\nbetween the three-point function coefficients for scalar, vector and mixed impurity\nBMN operators it is possible to reproduce, from the field theory point of view, two\nkey properties of the three-string vertex of Spradlin and Volovich, namely:\na. the vanishing of the three-string amplitude for string states with one vector and\none scalar impurity; and\nb. the relative minus sign in the string amplitude involving states with two vector\nimpurities compared to that with two scalar impurities.\nOnce this is taken into account, perfect agreement between the string and field\ntheory predictions is found.\nTo further clarify the ro\u02c6le of the compensating terms, we consider the flavour-singlet\nand flavour-triplet combinations:\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J34,S;m =\nC\n2\n\u221a\n2\n[ J\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr(\u03bb\u03b13 Z\nl \u03bb\n\u03b2\n4 Z\nJ\u2212l \u2212 \u03bb\u03b14 Z l \u03bb\u03b23ZJ\u2212l) \u2212\n\u221a\n2\n2\nTr\n(\n(F\u00b5\u03bd\u03c3\n\u00b5\u03bd)\u03b2\u03b3 \u01eb\n\u03b1\u03b3 ZJ+1\n)]\n(2.11)\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J34,T;m =\nC\n2\n\u221a\n2\n[ J\u2211\nl=0\ne\n2piiml\nJ Tr(\u03bb\u03b13 Z\nl \u03bb\n\u03b2\n4 Z\nJ\u2212l + \u03bb\u03b14 Z\nl \u03bb\n\u03b2\n3 Z\nJ\u2212l)\n]\n. (2.12)\nWe can further decompose each of the two operators in (2.11) and (2.12) into singlet and\ntriplet of the spin, that is\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J34,S;m \u2212\u2192 (1, 3+) + (1, 1) , (2.13)\nO\u03b1\u03b2;J34,T;m \u2212\u2192 (3+, 3+) + (3+, 1) . (2.14)\nIt is immediately seen that the compensating term on the right hand side of (2.11) is\nsymmetric under the exchange of the spin indices \u03b1 and \u03b2. This means that this compen-\nsating term will affect only the (1, 3+) representation. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe decomposition of the two-impurity BMN operators with vector impurities according to\nirreducible representations of SO(4)\u00d7SO(4). Indeed, by combining two vector impurities\nwe can form the following representations:\n(1, 4)\u00d7 (1, 4) = (1, 1) + (1, 9) + (1, 3+) + (1, 3\u2212) . (2.15)\nThe only representation the right hand sides of (2.13) and (2.14) have in common with\nthe right hand side of (2.15) are precisely (1, 3+), which receives a compensating term,\nand (1, 1), for which however no compensating term is generated as this order.5\nFor completeness, we mention here what are the possible irreducible representations\nof SO(4)\u00d7SO(4) \u223c SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) that can be obtained by combining\n5For a discussion along similar lines on the possible mixing of fermion BMN operators with scalar\noperators, see [22].\n6\ntwo fermion impurities:6\n((2, 1), (2, 1))\u00d7 ((2, 1), (2, 1)) = (1, 1) + (3+, 3+) + (3+, 1) + (1, 3+) ,(2.16)\n((1, 2), (1, 2))\u00d7 ((1, 2), (1, 2)) = (1, 1) + (3\u2212, 3\u2212) + (3\u2212, 1) + (1, 3\u2212) ,(2.17)\n((2, 1), (2, 1))\u00d7 ((1, 2), (1, 2)) = (4, 4) . (2.18)\n3 Comparing matrix elements of Hstring and \u2206\nIn this section we briefly review the strategy adopted in [8,10] to compare matrix elements\nof the dilatation operator \u2206 in SYM to matrix elements of the fully interacting string\nHamiltonian Hstring.\nTo begin with, we notice that Hstring and \u2206 act on the states of two different theories.\nHence, in order to test the duality (1.1) we need to construct an isomorphism between\nthe Hilbert spaces of the lightcone pp-wave string field theory and of the BMN sector\nof N = 4 Yang-Mills. The choice of the basis in string theory and in field theory is in\nprinciple arbitrary, however we remember that string field theory is naturally equipped\nwith an orthonormal basis of single- and multi-string states, given by the tensor product\nof single-string states. This natural string basis, {|s\u03b1\u3009string}, diagonalises the free string\nHamiltonian. Once interactions are taken into account, they allow the strings to split\nand join, i.e. the states in the natural string basis are not eigenstates of the interacting\npp-wave string Hamiltonian Hstring. Matrix elements of Hstring are known in the natural\nstring basis, hence our goal will be the identification of the field theory basis {|s\u03b1\u3009SYM}\nwhich is isomorphic to it. This, in turns, will enable us to recast (1.1) at the level of the\nmatrix elements as\nstring\u3008s\u03b1|\u00b5\u22121Hstring|s\u03b2\u3009string = SYM\u3008s\u03b1|\u2206\u2212 J |s\u03b2\u3009SYM . (3.1)\nBut what is the situation in field theory? In the conformal N = 4 Yang-Mills there is\nalso a privileged basis of states, the basis of conformal primary BMN operators O\u2206\u03b1(x),\nor \u2206-BMN basis. This is the basis of the eigenstates of the SYM dilatation operator,\nand its eigenkets can be expressed as linear combinations of the original BMN operators\nO\u03b1(x) proposed in [1]. For BMN operators with scalar impurities, the \u2206-BMN basis\nwas explicitly constructed in [31], and extended to include vector and mixed impurities\nin [20]. Conformal invariance guarantees that, in the \u2206-BMN basis, two- and three-point\nfunctions of \u2206-BMN operators take the canonical form, with a universal x-dependence.\nSpecifically, for scalar conformal primary operators one has\n\u3008O\u2020\u2206\u03b1(x)O\u2206\u03b2(0)\u3009 =\n\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n(x2)\u2206\u03b1\n, (3.2)\n6See also the discussion in section IV of [35].\n7\n\u3008O\u22061(x1)O\u22062(x2)O\u2020\u22063(x3)\u3009 =\nC123\n(x212)\n\u22061+\u22062\u2212\u22063\n2 (x213)\n\u22061+\u22063\u2212\u22062\n2 (x223)\n\u22062+\u22063\u2212\u22061\n2\n. (3.3)\nCorrelation functions of conformal primary operators with vector or mixed impurities\nappear to be harder to interpret, however it was noted in [20] that this problem is elim-\ninated, and the correlators for all types of impurities can be expressed in a form similar\nto (3.2) and (3.3), if on the left hand sides of (3.2) and (3.3) we use a different notion\nof conjugation O\u00af instead of O\u2020 [20, 26]. This different notion of operator conjugation is\ndefined as hermitian conjugation followed by an inversion of the insertion point of the\noperator x\u2032\u00b5 = x\u00b5\/x\n2.\nLet us now briefly review the transformation properties under an inversion of scalar\nand fermion operators [36]. A scalar operatorO\u2206(x) of conformal dimension \u2206 transforms\nas\nO\u2206(x)\u2192 O\u2032\u2206(x\u2032) = x2\u2206O\u2206(x) , x\u00b5 \u2192 x\u2032\u00b5 =\nx\u00b5\nx2\n, (3.4)\nwhile vector or tensor operators (i.e. operator with vector impurities) pick a factor J\u00b5\u03bd(x) =\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 2x\u00b5x\u03bd\/x2 on the right hand side for each vector index of the operator. J\u00b5\u03bd(x) is\nthe usual inversion tensor, in terms of which the Jacobian of the inversion is expressed\n\u2202x\u2032\u00b5\/\u2202x\u03bd = J\u00b5\u03bd(x)\/x\n2. This prescription is essential in order to make vector \u2206-BMN op-\nerators orthonormalisable, see section 2 of [20] for more details. Let us now concentrate\non the fermionic operators which are of direct concern for this paper.7 It is well known\nthat, under conformal inversion, a Dirac spinor field \u03c8 of dimension d transforms as [36]\n\u03c8(x)\u2192 \u03c8\u2032(x\u2032) = \u03b7 x\u02c6|x| x\n2d \u03c8(x) , \u03b74 = 1 , (3.5)\nwhere x\u02c6 = x\u00b5\u03b3\n\u00b5, and \u03b3\u00b5 are the Euclidean gamma matrices. In terms of Weyl spinors \u03bb\u03b1,\n\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9, (3.5) implies\n\u03bb\u03b1(x)\u2192 \u03bb\u2032\u03b1(x\u2032) = \u03b7\n(x\u03be\u00af)\u03b1\n|x| x\n2d , (3.6)\n\u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9(x)\u2192 \u03be\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u2032(x\u2032) = \u03b7 (x\u00af\u03bb)\n\u03b1\u02d9\n|x| x\n2d , (3.7)\nwhere we set x = x\u00b5\u03c3\n\u00b5, x\u00af = x\u00b5\u03c3\u00af\n\u00b5. Hence, an operator of conformal dimension \u2206 with\nf = p+ q fermionic insertions transforms under inversion as:\nO\u03b1\u02d91...\u03b1\u02d9q\u03b11...\u03b1p(x) \u2192 \u03b7f x2\u2206 J\u03b11\u03b2\u02d91 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7J\u03b1p\u03b2\u02d9p \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 J\u00af \u03b1\u02d91\u03b21 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 J\u00af \u03b1\u02d9q\u03b2q O\n\u03b2\u02d91...\u03b2\u02d9p\n\u03b21...\u03b2q\n(x) , (3.8)\nwhere\nJ\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9(x) :=\nx\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n|x| , J\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2(x) :=\nx\u00af\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\n|x| . (3.9)\n7The transformation under inversion of fermionic BMN operators has also been considered in [26].\n8\nThe notion of conjugation [20], as ordinary hermitian conjugation followed by an inversion,\ncan then applied to a generic operator with conformal dimension \u2206 with scalar, vector or\nfermion impurities; and the conjugated operator O\u00af can then be written (schematically)\nas:\nO\u00af\u2206(x) \u2261 x2\u2206 J \u00b7 O\u2020\u2206(x) , (3.10)\nwhere by J we mean the tensor product by the appropriate inversion operators J\u00b5\u03bd(x),\nfor each vector index, and J\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9(x) (or J\u00af\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b1(x)), for each spinor index. It was noticed in [20]\nthat the advantage of this new conjugation resides in that the two-point function for\nscalar, vector and fermion \u2206-BMN operators take all the same canonical form when the\nO\u00af operator is employed:\n\u3008O\u00af\u2206a(x)O\u2206b(0)\u3009 = \u03b4ab . (3.11)\nThe right hand side of (3.11) does not depend on x, and represents the overlap of the\ncorresponding states in conformal N = 4 Super Yang-Mills.8\nThe operators of a generic basis in field theory will not enjoy the simple interpretation\nin terms of states given by (3.11), nevertheless we can always decompose these operators\nalong the eigenvectors of the \u2206-BMN basis. Specifically, for any operator basis O\u02dc\u03b1 such\nthat\nO\u02dc\u03b1 = U\u03b1\u03b2 O\u2206\u03b2 , (3.12)\nwhere U\u03b1\u03b2 is a constant matrix, we can easily compute the overlap of the basis vectors:\nthis is simply given by [10]\n\u3008 \u00af\u02dcO\u03b1(x)O\u02dc\u03b2(0)\u3009 = U\u03b2\u03b3U \u2020\u03b3\u03b1 \u2261 S\u03b2\u03b1 . (3.13)\nThe previous relation is highly nontrivial: despite the fact that the operators O\u02dc\u03b1 do not\nhave definite scaling dimensions, the overlap (3.13) does not depend on x! The key step\nin this procedure is to be found in the inversion procedure. Indeed, notice that in (3.4)\nthe full conformal dimension \u2206 of the conformal BMN operator O\u2206\u03b1 is used in order to\ndefine the proper notion of conjugation. This expression will have in general a perturbative\n(and, in principle, nonperturbative) expansion in \u03bb\u2032, which is eventually responsible for\nthe simple form of (3.13) (and (3.11)).\nA simple and practical way of calculating simultaneously the overlaps of states and\nthe matrix elements of the anomalous dimension operator \u03b4 = \u2206 \u2212 \u2206cl (where \u2206cl is\nthe canonical dimension in the free theory) was described in [10]. We will apply this\nprocedure in the following, therefore we briefly outline its steps. First, one defines the\nbarred-operator \u00af\u02dcO(x) as the Hermitian conjugation of O\u02dc(x) followed by an inversion of\nthe resulting operator, defined as if it was free, i.e. instead of the factor x2\u2206 in (3.10) we\nput x2\u2206cl , such that\nO\u00af\u2206(x) \u2261 x2\u2206cl J \u00b7 O\u2020\u2206(x) . (3.14)\n8A side comment: for two-impurity fermion BMN operators, an additional minus sign should be\nincluded in the definition of the hermitian conjugation of the operators in order to get the two-point\nfunctions normalised as in (3.11).\n9\nThe two-point function takes now the form:\n\u3008 \u00af\u02dcO\u03b1(x)O\u02dc\u03b2(0)\u3009 = U\u03b2\u03b3 e\u03b4\u03b3 log(\u039bx)\u22122 U \u2020\u03b3\u03b1\n= S\u03b2\u03b1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 log(\u039bx)\n\u22122 +O ((log(\u039bx)\u22122)2) , (3.15)\nwhere we have expanded the full result in powers of log x\u22122. From (3.15) we can read off\nthe overlap of the two states, defined as the zeroth-order term of the expansion,\nS\u03b2\u03b1 = U\u03b2\u03b3U\n\u2020\n\u03b3\u03b1 , (3.16)\nas well as the matrix of anomalous dimensions in this basis, given by the first order term,\nT\u03b2\u03b1 = U\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u03b3U\n\u2020\n\u03b3\u03b1 . (3.17)\nWe now consider the original BMN basis, for which we have\n\u3008O\u00af\u03b1(x)O\u03b2\u3009 = S\u03b2\u03b1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 log x\u22122 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.18)\nand relate this basis to the isomorphic to string basis via a transformation U as in (3.12):\nOstring\u03b2 = U\u03b2\u03b3O\u03b3 , O\u00afstring\u03b1 = O\u00af\u03b4U \u2020\u03b4\u03b1 . (3.19)\nIn the basis isomorphic to the natural string basis, we have\nSstring = 1l = USU \u2020 , T string = UTU \u2020 . (3.20)\nNotice that S is a Hermitian, positive matrix, therefore S\u22121\/2 is well-defined.9 S is then\ndiagonalised by choosing\nU := S\u22121\/2 \u00b7 V , (3.21)\nwhere V \u2020V = 1l:\nS \u2212\u2192 USU \u2020 = 1l , (3.22)\nT \u2212\u2192 UTU \u2020 = V \u2020(S\u2212 12TS\u2212 12 )V . (3.23)\nAt this point, there is still an arbitrariness contained in V . This was fixed in [5, 8]\nby requiring that (3.1) holds and that the known three-string interaction vertex of the\npp-wave light-cone string field theory [11, 12] is reproduced from gauge theory matrix\nelements involving BMN states (operators) with two scalar impurities. This condition\nimplies V = 1l. Hence, we conclude that the matrix of anomalous dimensions in the string\nbasis is given by [8, 10]\n\u0393 := T string = S\u2212\n1\n2 T S\u2212\n1\n2 . (3.24)\nThis is the result we wanted to derive. The procedure for obtaining the matrix elements\nof the anomalous dimension operator (and hence of the dilatation operator in Yang-Mills)\nin the basis in field theory which is isomorphic to the natural string basis is therefore\n9The matrix S\u2212\n1\n2 also appears in [19] and [40].\n10\nclear: choose an arbitrary operator basis in Yang-Mills (in particular the simple basis\noriginally considered by BMN in [1]), and compute two-point functions as in (3.15) (or\n(3.18)); work out the expressions for the matrices S and T ; and, finally, apply (3.24) to\nderive the desired matrix elements in the isomorphic to string basis.\nEq. (3.24) was employed in [10] to explore and successfully test the bosonic (scalar and\nvector) sector of the BMN correspondence, finding precise agreement between the matrix\nelements in of the interacting string Hamiltonian in string field theory and the dual matrix\nelements (3.24) of the field theory dilatation operator. In the next sections we will pursue\nthis programme and carry out a number of tests in the fermionic sector of the string and\nfield theory. More precisely, we will show that, with the same choice of V = 1l, the matrix\nelements of \u0393 between BMN operators with two fermion impurities precisely agree with\nthe corresponding matrix elements of the interacting string Hamiltonian.\nOther studies of the dilatation operator in N = 4 Yang-Mills and its interpretation in\nquantum mechanical and integrable models can be found in the recent papers [37\u201346].\n4 Matrix elements of Hstring in string field theory\nThere are two equivalent ways to describe superstring interactions in string field theory,\nknown as the SO(8) and the SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4) formalism. In the former approach, the\nthree-string vertex in string field theory is built upon a state |0\u3009 with energy equal to 4\u00b5.\nThis state is therefore not the ground state, but it has the advantage that, as \u00b5 \u2192 0,\nthe SO(8) construction flows smoothly to string field theory in flat space [47\u201350]. In the\nSO(4)\u00d7SO(4) formalism, the Hilbert space of states in string field theory is built on the\ntrue vacuum |v\u3009 of pp-wave string theory (see Appendix A for details). Remarkably, the\ntwo formalisms have been shown to be completely equivalent [23], hence it is only a matter\nof convenience which one to use. In this paper we will make use of the SO(4)\u00d7 SO(4)\nvertex, since there it is more straightforward to compute string amplitudes involving\nfermionic oscillators.\nThe string amplitude has the form [11,12]10\n\u30081|\u30082|Hstring |3\u3009 = \u3008\u03a6|P|VB\u3009|VF \u3009 , (4.1)\nwhere \u3008\u03a6| := \u30081|\u30082|\u30083|\u2032 is the external three\u2013string state, and |VB\u3009 and |VF \u3009 are the\nkinematical part of the bosonic and fermionic vertex, (B.6) and (B.7) respectively. Finally,\nthe prefactor P is written in (B.9).\nWe will be interested in external states with fermionic impurities,\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 \u2020n(r) \u03b2\n\u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u2032 \u2020\n\u2212n(r) |v\u3009r , (4.2)\n10The reader is referred to Appendix A for more details on the string field theory vertex.\n11\nwhere the fermionic operators \u03b2\u2019s are related to the oscillators in the string basis by [14]\n\u03b2n =\n1\u221a\n2\n(bn + ib\u2212n) , \u03b2\u2212n =\n1\u221a\n2\n(bn \u2212 ib\u2212n) .

Notice that from (4.5) it follows that\na. the string amplitude vanishes whenever a fermion appears more than once, whereas\nb. it is nonvanishing when all fermions are different, and gives always the same result\n(up to a minus sign).\nIt is more illuminating to write (4.5) for a few basic cases:\nH12,11;m,J11,12;n,J,y := \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b212\u2212m(3)\u03b211m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b212,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 (4.6)\n= \u2212\u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b221,\u2212m(3)\u03b222,m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b212,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032Cnorm\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 ,\nH11,11;m,J11,11;n,J,y := \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b211\u2212m(3)\u03b211m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b211,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009\n= \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b222,\u2212m(3)\u03b222,m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b211,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 = 0 , (4.7)\nH22,11;m,J11,22;n,J,y := \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b222\u2212m(3)\u03b211m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b222,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 (4.8)\n= \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b211,\u2212m(3)\u03b222,m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b222,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 = 0 ,\nH21,11;m,J11,21;n,J,y := \u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b221\u2212m(3)\u03b211m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b221,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 (4.9)\n= \u2212\u00b5\u22121\u3008v|\u03b212,\u2212m(3)\u03b222,m(3)\u03b211,n(1)\u03b221,\u2212n(1)|H3\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032Cnorm\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 .\nWe can directly compare the expressions (4.6)-(4.9) to the analogous matrix elements\nobtained from the three-string vertex of [11,12] for scalar and for vector and mixed (scalar-\nvector) BMN states:\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008T J,yij,n|Hstring|OJij,m\u3009 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032Cnorm\n\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 , (4.10)\n12\n1\u00b5\n\u3008T J,yi\u00b5,n|Hstring|OJi\u00b5,m\u3009 = 0 , (4.11)\n1\n\u00b5\n\u3008T J,y\u00b5\u03bd,n|Hstring|OJ\u00b5\u03bd,m\u3009 = \u03bb\u2032Cnorm\n\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 . (4.12)\nNotice hat the amplitude in (4.6) is identical to the amplitude (4.10) involving two scalars\nof different flavour, whereas that in (4.9) is equal to the amplitude (4.12) involving two\ndifferent vectors. Similar considerations apply to the vanishing of the mixed amplitude\n(4.11) and (4.7), (4.8).\nThe equality of the string amplitude between two BMN states with scalar impurities\nand two BMN states with fermion impurities had already been derived, in the SO(8)\nformalism, in [14]. We also notice that our amplitudes, derived in the SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4)\nformalism, precisely coincide with those of [14].\n5 Matrix elements of \u2206 in N = 4 Yang-Mills\nIn [10], a general technique was devised for deriving the matrix of overlaps S (3.16), the\nmatrix of anomalous dimension T (3.17), and hence the desired matrix elements of the\nSYM dilatation operator in the isomorphic to string basis, (3.24), from the coefficients of\nthe three-point functions of BMN operators. Here we report the results of the analysis\nof [10], referring the curious reader to section 3 of that paper for more details.11\nThe matrices S and T have an expansion in powers of g2, but in our analysis we will\nonly need their expressions up to and including O(g2) terms. We will also work at one\nloop in the effective \u2019t Hooft coupling \u03bb\u2032. Notice that the matrix T is of O(\u03bb\u2032), whereas\nS is of O(1). In this case, (3.15) is simply\n\u3008O\u03b1(0)O\u00af\u03b2(x)\u3009 = S\u03b1\u03b2 + T\u03b1\u03b2 log(x\u039b)\u22122 . (5.1)\nLet us focus on the following three-point correlators,\nG(x1, x2, x3) = \u3008Oy\u00b7JAB,n(x1)O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2)O\u00afJAB,m(x3)\u3009 , (5.2)\nwhere A can be a scalar, vector or fermion index, and A 6= B. On general grounds, these\nthree-point function take the form [7, 31\u201334]\nG(x1, x2, x3) = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u2032 (am,ny log(x31\u039b)2 + bm,ny log(x32x31\u039b\/x12))] , (5.3)\nwhere g2Cm,ny is the tree-level contribution, with\nCm,ny :=\n\u221a\n(1\u2212 y)\/y sin2(\u03c0my)\u221a\nJ \u03c02(m\u2212 n\/y)2 , (5.4)\n11Our notation and conventions in Yang-Mills are reviewed in Appendix A.\n13\nand the coefficients am,ny and bm,ny must be calculated in perturbation theory at O(\u03bb\u2032).\nThe two-point function \u3008T J,yAB,n(0) O\u00afJAB,m(x)\u3009 can easily be derived from (5.2) by simply\nsetting x13 = x23 = x and x12 = \u039b\n\u22121 [34],\n\u3008T J,yAB,n(0) O\u00afJAB,m(x)\u3009 = g2Cm,ny\n[\n1 + \u03bb\u2032 (am,ny + bm,ny) log(x\u039b)\n\u22122\n]\n. (5.5)\nThe analysis of section 3 of [10] then showed that the matrices S and T are then given,\nup to O(g2), by the following expressions:\nS =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03b4mn g2Cm,qz\ng2Cpy,n \u03b4pq\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 + O(g22) = 1l + g2s+O(g22) , (5.6)\n(5.7)\nT = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn g2Cm,ny (a+ b)m,qz\ng2Cpy,n (a + b)py,n (p\n2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 + O(g22) (5.8)\n\u2261 d + g2t + O(g22) ,\nwith\nd = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn 0\n0 (p2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , (5.9)\nt = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0 Cm,ny (a + b)m,qz\nCpy,n (a+ b)py,n 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (5.10)\nIt then follows that\nS\u22121\/2 = 1l\u2212 g2(s\/2) +O(g22) (5.11)\ndiagonalises S at O(g2), and hence (3.24) leads to\n\u0393 = d+ g2\n[\nt\u2212 1\n2\n{s , d}\n]\n. (5.12)\nWe now need to compute the explicit expressions for aymn and b\ny\nmn for the fermion case.\nFirst, it was observed in [10] that, at O(\u03bb\u2032) in planar perturbation theory, the coefficient\naymn is simply given by the O(\u03bb\u2032) anomalous dimension of the \u201csmall\u201d BMN operator at\nx1. In accordance with supersymmetry, it turns out that the O(\u03bb\u2032) anomalous dimension\nof BMN operators with two arbitrary impurities is given by\nam,ny =\nn2\ny2\n, (5.13)\nindependently of the type of impurity considered. This result was first obtained for the\ncase of two scalar impurities in [1], for one scalar and one vector impurity in [29], for two\n14\nvector impurities in [52]. We have also explicitly derived (5.13) in the fermion case with\na perturbative calculation in Yang-Mills.\nWe now move on to consider bm,ny. From (5.3), we see that bm,ny is the coefficient\nwhich multiplies the log x12 contribution in the three-point function G(x1, x2, x3) in (5.2),\nwhere the \u201clarge\u201d (\u201csmall\u201d) BMN operator O\u00afJAB,m (Oy\u00b7JAB,n) is inserted at x3 (x1), and the\nvacuum operator Ovac at point x2. Hence, the tactic we will follow in the next section\nwill consist in computing the log x12 term of the three-point function\n12 G(x1, x2, x3).\nLet us quote here the result for bm,ny in the case of scalar, mixed, or vector BMN\noperators in (5.2) [10]:\n[bm,ny]scalar = m\n2 \u2212 mn\ny\n, (5.14)\n[bm,ny]scalar\u2212vector =\n1\n2\n(\nm2 \u2212 n\n2\ny2\n)\n, (5.15)\n[bm,ny]vector = \u2212\nn2\ny2\n+\nmn\ny\n. (5.16)\nWe conclude this section with one important comment, which anticipates our results for\nthe fermions to be derived in the next section: we will show that, for fermion BMN\noperators, the coefficients bm,ny for the various representations precisely take one of the\nthree expressions (5.14)-(5.16).\n5.1 The three-point function of fermion BMN operators\nIn the previous section we explained how to obtain the matrix elements of the SYM dilata-\ntion operator in any arbitrary basis of SYM operators, and specifically in the isomorphic\nto string basis. Here we present the field theory computation of the coefficients bm,ny\nappearing in (5.3), from which the coefficient of the conformal three-point function of\ntwo-impurity fermion BMN operators can also be derived. The matrix elements (5.12) of\nthe SYM dilatation operators in the natural string basis will then be obtained using the\nexpressions for bm,ny and (5.6)-(5.10) and (5.13). The reader not interested in the details\nof this calculations may skip a few pages, and proceed directly to section 6.\nLet us consider the three-point function of the operators in (2.8), i.e.\n\u3008Oy\u00b7J3\u03b1,4\u03b2;n(x1)O(1\u2212y)\u00b7Jvac (x2) O\u00afJ3\u03b1\u02d9,4\u03b2\u02d9;m(x3)\u3009 . (5.17)\n12It was shown in [10,53] that from the knowledge of the coefficient bm,ny it is also possible to determine\nthe coefficient of the conformal three-point function, despite the fact that, due to mixing effects [31, 54],\nthe correlator (5.2) does not take the conformal form (3.3), since the original BMN operators in (5.3) are\nnot conformal primaries for g2 6= 0.\n15\nWe start off by evaluating the Feynman diagrams which originate from the pure BMN\nparts of both the barred and unbarred operators. These diagrams are represented in\nFigure 1, where we draw only the diagrams where the impurities \u03bb4\u03b1 and \u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9 participate\nin the interactions, and the other impurity propagates freely. In diagram 1a (type I), the\ninteracting impurity goes across, while in 1b the interacting impurity goes straight (type\nII). The latter diagram has a minus sign relative to the former from the Yukawa vertex\n(see (A.3)). The result for the type I diagram is, concentrating on the interacting part:\n\u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9 \u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9\u03bb\u00af3\u03b1\u02d9\n\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\u03bb\u00af4\u03b2\u02d9\n\u03bb4\u03b1\u03bb4\u03b1\n\u03bb4\u03b1\n\u03bb4\u03b1\n\u03bb4\u03b1\nZZ\nZZ\nx1 x2\n1a 1b 1c\n1d 1e 1f\nFigure 1: Feynman diagrams from the pure BMN parts: of type I (in 1a and 1d) and\ntype II (1b and 1e). Diagrams 1d, 1e, are the mirrors of 1a, 1b. Diagrams 1d and 1e\nhave phase factors which are the complex conjugate of those of 1a and 1b. The gluon\ninteraction diagrams in 1c and 1f have the same BMN factor and cancel each other.\nJI\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n= (\u22021\u03bd\u03c3\n\u03bd\n\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9)(\u2212\n\u221a\n2i\u01eb\u03c8\u02d9\u03b1\u02d9)\u03c3\u03c1\n\u03c7\u03c8\u02d9\n(\u2212\n\u221a\n2i\u01eb\u03b2\u03c7)(\u2212\u22023\u00b5\u03c3\u00b5\u03b2\u03b2\u02d9)H\u03c11423 , (5.18)\nwhere\nH\u03c11423 =\n\u222b\nd4x d4y \u2206(x1 \u2212 x)\u2206(x4 \u2212 x)\n[\u2212\u2202x\u03c1\u2206(x\u2212 y)]\u2206(x3 \u2212 y)\u2206(x4 \u2212 y)\n= \u2212(\u22021\u03c1 + \u22024\u03c1)H1432 . (5.19)\n16\nNotice that in order to be able to perform the inversion in the conjugated operator, we\nmomentarily split the insertion points of the fermion and the Z impurity, respectively x3\nand x4. The last equality is obtained after integrating by parts with respect to x and\nthen converting the x derivative acting on \u2206(x1 \u2212 x) and \u2206(x4 \u2212 x) to derivatives with\nrespect to x1 and x4, respectively. The partial derivatives in (5.18) come from the fermion\npropagator S\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9(x) = \u2212\u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9\u2206(x), where \u2202\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9 := \u2202\u00b5\u03c3\u00b5\u03b1\u03b1\u02d9.\nUsing now (A.9) and ignoring the \u01eb term which eventually does not contribute to the\nlog x212 term, one obtains:\nJI\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n= 2\n[\n\u22023\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\nJA + \u2202\n1\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\nJB + (\u2202\n1 + \u22024)\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9JC\n]\n, (5.20)\nwhere\nJA = \u2202\n1 \u00b7 (\u22021 + \u22024)H1423 , (5.21)\nJB = \u2202\n3 \u00b7 (\u22021 + \u22024)H1423 , (5.22)\nJC = \u2212\u22023 \u00b7 \u22021H1423 . (5.23)\nThe explicit expressions for JA, JB and JC are worked out in (E.8)-(E.10). After some\nalgebra, one realises that the only non-zero contribution to JI\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\ncomes from the term\ninvolving JA. Keeping track of the relevant to us terms which contain log x\n2\n12, we get:\nJI\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n=\n1\n23\u03c02\nlog x212\u2206(x4 \u2212 x1)\n[\n\u22024\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\n\u2206(x4 \u2212 x1)\n]\n. (5.24)\nWe note that (5.24) is precisely of the form of (a first-order correction to) two freely\npropagating fields, one Z boson and one fermion, as it is expected. In order to make\nthe comparison with the string amplitude, we should now apply the inversion on the\nconjugated operator, that is on the scalar Z field and the interacting fermion. For the\nscalar field this is rather trivial: according to (3.4), one has to multiply JI\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\nby x24. For\nthe fermion, (3.6) instructs us to multiply by \u03b7x24\u03c3\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\u03b2\n\u00b5 x\n\u00b5\n4 . Taking into account the identity\n(\u03c3\u00b5)\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\u03c3\u00af\n\u03b2\u02d9\u03b2\n\u03bd x\n\u00b5x\u03bd = \u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 x\n2 one obtains:\n\u2212 4\n(g2\n2\n)3\nPI\nlog x212\n28\u03c06\n\u03b72\u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 . (5.25)\nThe overall factor (g2\/2)3 comes from the insertion of two vertices, which give (2\/g2)2, and\nfive propagators, which give (g2\/2)5. PI is the phase factor associated with the diagrams\nof type I, and is explicitly calculated in (C.2). In order to obtain the final result for the\ntype I diagrams, we have still to multiply (5.25) by a factor of 2 from the free contraction\nof the non-interacting impurity, and by a factor of 1\/4 from the normalisation of the two\nfermion BMN operators. Doing so, and setting \u03b72 = 1 we get:\ntype I\u2212 fermions : \u22122\n(g2\n2\n)3\nPI\nlog x212\n28\u03c06\n\u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 . (5.26)\n17\nNotice that this result is precisely the same as the result for the case of two different\nscalar impurities. Similarly, one gets, for the type II diagrams:\ntype II\u2212 fermions : 2\n(g2\n2\n)3\nPII\nlog x212\n28\u03c06\n\u03b4\u03b2\u03b1 . (5.27)\nTo the type II diagrams is associated the phase factor PII of (C.2). Moreover, in order\nto get the final expression for the coefficient bm,ny, one should also include the diagrams\nwhere the other impurity, \u03bb3, participates in the interaction.\nIf this was the whole story, we would conclude that three-point functions of fermions\ntake the same form as the three-point functions for scalars. But the correct expressions for\nBMN operators often contain compensating terms, and so is the case for the operator in\n(2.8). Importantly, these compensating terms do contribute to the three-point functions\nand must be taken into account. In our case, the compensating terms affect the fermion\noperators that have a projection in the (1, 3+) representation (see the discussion after\n(2.14)), and the corresponding contribution is important and we will now compute it.\nIn Figure 2 we draw the Feynman diagrams obtained by taking the compensating term\non the right hand side of (2.8) for the operator sitting at x1 . To the diagrams 2a and 2c\na BMN phase factor equal to 1 is associated.

(5.28)\nThe factor of (\u22121)3 comes from three propagators, while the factor of 2 arises from the\ntwo terms in the field strength F\u03c1\u03b4.

The gluon is absorbed by the fermion field. There are also mirror diagrams, not\ndrawn in this figure.\nNow we perform the inversion for the fermions, thus arriving at:\nI\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u02c6\u03b3\u02c6 = 8\n\u221a\n2\n1\n28\u03c06\nlog x212 (\u03b4\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u02c6\u03b4\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\u02c6 + \u03b4\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\u02c6 \u03b4\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u02c6) . (5.32)\nThe calculation for the diagram in Figure 2c (where the other fermion absorbs the gluon)\nproceeds in a similar fashion to that of Figure 2a, giving the same result as in (5.32) but\nwith \u03b1 and \u03b2 swapped. Since the expression for I\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u02c6\u03b3\u02c6 is symmetric under this exchange, the\nresults is the same as for the diagram in Figure 2a. We should also not forget to multiply\nour result by 1\/4 due to the normalisation of the operators (1\/2 for each operator), and\nby a factor of \u2212\u221a2\/4 coming from the compensating term on the right hand side of\n(2.8). Taking also account the powers of g2\/2 associated with vertices and propagators,\nwe finally get the result for the sum of diagrams 2a and 2c:\n\u2212 2\n(\ng2\n2\n)3\n1\n28\u03c06\nlog x212 (\u03b4\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u02c6\u03b4\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\u02c6 + \u03b4\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\u02c6 \u03b4\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\u02c6) .

The gluon is absorbed by the Z field.\nThe diagrams in Figure 2b and 2d can be computed in a similar way. Notice that they\nhave a relative minus sign compared to 2a and 2c, and a different BMN factor q\u00afJ1+1.\nFor \u03b1 6= \u03b2, the result of (5.33) is exactly the same as the result obtained from the\ncompensating diagrams for the case of BMN operators with mixed impurities (one vector\nand one scalar impurity). We addressed this case in section 4 of [10]. Furthermore, for\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 we get the same result as that of the compensating diagrams of BMN operators\nwith vector impurities, i.e. twice that of the mixed case (see [10,20]). From (5.14)-(5.16),\none can easily work out the contributions of the compensating terms alone for the mixed\n20\nand vector case,\n[bm,ny]\nc.t.\nmixed = [bm,ny]mixed \u2212 [bm,ny]scalar = \u2212\n1\n2\n(\nm\u2212 n\ny\n)2\n, (5.34)\n[bm,ny]\nc.t.\nvector = [bm,ny]vector \u2212 [bm,ny]scalar = \u2212\n(\nm\u2212 n\ny\n)2\n(5.35)\n= 2 [bm,ny]\nc.t.\nmixed .\nFinally, let us note that at the order we are working, the diagrams of Figure 3 are also\npresent. However, the diagram in 3a cancels against that in 3b because of the relative\nminus sign associated with the vertex where the gluon is absorbed; and, similarly, 3c\ncancels against 3d. Therefore the net contribution of the diagrams in Figure 3 is zero.\nWe conclude by summarising the results of this section.\na. The contribution of the pure BMN part of the operators involved in the three-point\nfunction (5.17) is precisely the same obtained for scalar BMN operators. Hence the\ncorresponding coefficient bm,ny is given by (5.14).\nb. The previous remark also implies that, when no compensating term is present in the\nexpression for the BMN operator considered, the result (5.14) gives the full answer.\nc. When a compensating term appears, it contributes precisely as the compensating\nterm of the mixed (scalar-vector) case when \u03b1 6= \u03b2, of the vector case for \u03b1 = \u03b2. The\ncorresponding expressions for bm,ny are then (5.15) and (5.16), respectively.\n6 Testing the BMN correspondence in the fermion\nsector\nWe can now apply the results derived in the previous section to test the pp-wave\/SYM\ncorrespondence in the fermionic sector. In particular, we will reproduce in the gauge\ntheory the three-string amplitudes for the following flavour-conserving processes:\n(\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb32)m \u2212\u2192 (\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb32)n + vac. , (6.1)\n(\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb31)m \u2212\u2192 (\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb31)n + vac. , (6.2)\n(\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb42)m \u2212\u2192 (\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb42)n + vac. , (6.3)\n(\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb41)m \u2212\u2192 (\u03bb31 . . . \u03bb41)n + vac. . (6.4)\nA few comments are in order.\n1. First, it does not take long to realise that these cases actually cover all the irre-\nducible representations of the two-impurity fermion BMN operators, where the two\nimpurities are Weyl spinor of the same chirality (see (2.16) and (2.17)).\n21\n2. The case where the two impurities have opposite chirality, \u03bbr\u03b1 and \u03bb\u00afr\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 (see (2.18)),\ncan of course be treated with a similar technique. Notice that, in that case, a com-\npensating term containing (D\u00b5\u03c6\ni)\u03c3\u00b5\n\u03b1\u03b2\u02d9\nwill always be present in the precise expression\nof the BMN operator containing the \u03bbr\u03b1, \u03bb\u00afr\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 impurities, in agreement with the fact\nthat the right hand side of (2.18) contains only one irreducible representation.\n3. Finally, notice that the operators taking part in the first two processes (6.1) and\n(6.2) do not have compensating terms, i.e. they do not have a projection onto the\n(1, 3+) representation of SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4), in contradistinction with the operators\ntaking part in the remaining last two, (6.3) and (6.4).\nLet us write down the string amplitudes corresponding to the processes of (6.1)-(6.4),\ntaking into account that in the three-string vertex of [11,12,14,23] all the external states\nare written as ket states:\n\u00b5\u22121\u3008v| \u03b212\u2212m(3) \u03b211m(3) \u03b211,n(1) \u03b212,\u2212n(1) |H3\u3009 \u2261 A1 ,\n\u00b5\u22121\u3008v| \u03b211\u2212m(3) \u03b211m(3) \u03b211,n(1) \u03b211,\u2212n(1) |H3\u3009 \u2261 A2 ,\n\u00b5\u22121\u3008v| \u03b222\u2212m(3) \u03b211m(3) \u03b211,n(1) \u03b222,\u2212n(1) |H3\u3009 \u2261 A3 ,\n\u00b5\u22121\u3008v| \u03b221\u2212m(3) \u03b211m(3) \u03b211,n(1) \u03b221,\u2212n(1) |H3\u3009 \u2261 A4 . (6.5)\nWe have already computed the string amplitudes in (6.5) in (4.6)-(4.9), finding\nA1 = \u2212\u03bb\u2032Cnorm\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 , (6.6)\nA2 = 0 , (6.7)\nA3 = 0 , (6.8)\nA4 = \u03bb\n\u2032Cnorm\n\u03b2 + 1\n\u03c02\nsin2 \u03c0m\u03b2 . (6.9)\nWe start our analysis from the first process (6.1). For this case, we have found in the\nprevious section that the corresponding coefficient bm,ny of the field theory three-point\nfunction is exactly the same as that obtained in the case of BMN operators with two\nscalar impurities of different flavours. This is due to the absence of compensating terms\nin the operators participating in the process (6.1), so that only the diagrams of Figure 1\ncontribute (with \u03bb4 replaced by the second \u03bb3). As explained in (5.13), supersymmetry\nguarantees that the anomalous dimension of the two fermion BMN operators is the same\nas that of two scalars; therefore, the coefficient am,ny for the fermions is identical to that\nof two different scalars. The consequence of this is that the gauge theory prediction for\nthe string amplitude of (6.1) is exactly the same as the prediction obtained in the case of\nBMN operators with two different scalar impurities; and it was shown in [10] that there\nis precise agreement between the field theory and string theory prediction in the case of\ntwo scalar impurities of different flavours. The result obtained in string field theory for\n22\nthe process (6.1) is given in (6.6). Indeed, this result (6.6) precisely coincides with the\nstring amplitude for the case of two scalar impurities, Eq. (4.10). This is our first test.\nTwo identical fermions, both in the unbarred and barred operators, take part in the\nprocess in (6.2). The corresponding gauge theory calculation is therefore slightly more\ncomplicated, since there are twice as many contractions as in the previous case, and thus\ntwice as many Feynman diagrams. Taking these diagrams into account, the S and T\nmatrices take the following form:\nS =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03b4mn g2 (Cm,qz \u2212 Cm,\u2212qz)\ng2 (Cpy,n \u2212 C\u2212py,n) \u03b4pq\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 + O(g22) (6.10)\n= 1l + g2s+O(g22) ,\nT = \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nm2 \u03b4mn g2\n[\nCm,qz (a+ b)m,qz\n\u2212Cm,\u2212qz (a+ b)m,\u2212qz\n]\ng2\n[\nCpy,n (a+ b)py,n (p\n2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\u2212C\u2212py,n (a + b)\u2212py,n\n]\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 + O(g22) (6.11)\n= d + g2t + O(g22) .\nIn (6.11) the coefficient am,ny is as in (5.13), and bm,ny is given in (5.14), as explained\nin section 5. We should note the crucial minus sign between the two terms appearing\nin the non-diagonal matrix elements of T . This comes from the anticommuting nature\nof the fermion impurities. We can now work out the expression for the matrix \u0393 of the\nSYM dilatation operator in the field theory basis which is isomorphic to the natural string\nbasis. Using (5.12), we get immediately\n\u0393 = d+ g2\n[\nt\u2212 (1\/2){s, d}\n]\n= \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn 0\n0 (p2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (6.12)\nThus, we conclude that the field theory prediction for the second process (6.2) is 0. This\nis in agreement with the vanishing of the corresponding string amplitude of (6.7).\nNext, we consider the third process, (6.3). In this case the compensating diagrams\nof Figure 2 should be taken into account. As we have noticed in the previous section\n(see the discussion after (5.33)), the contribution of the compensating term is the same\nas that arising from compensating terms of BMN operators with mixed (one scalar-one\nvector) impurities. Furthermore, the contribution of the diagrams where only the pure\nBMN parts of the operators is taken into account, is the same for all the cases (i.e. scalar,\n23\nmixed, vector and fermion impurities). Therefore, we conclude that the coefficient bm,ny\nappearing in the the three-point function, and thus the whole calculation, are identical\nto the mixed case studied in [10].14 It was found in [10] that the matrix elements of the\ndilatation operator in the isomorphic to string basis for the case of BMN operators with\nmixed impurities is given by\n\u0393mixed = d+ g2\n[\ntmixed \u2212 (1\/2){s, d}\n]\n= \u03bb\u2032\n\uf8eb\uf8ed m2 \u03b4mn 0\n0 (p2\/y2) \u03b4pq\u03b4yz\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (6.13)\nTherefore, the previous result (6.13) precisely reproduces, in the gauge theory, the van-\nishing three-string amplitude of (6.8).\nFinally, we focus on the last process of (6.4). We noticed in section 5 that the diagrams\nfrom the compensating terms contribute, in this case, exactly as the diagrams from the\ncompensating term for two vector operators. Following similar arguments as before, we\nconclude that the field theory prediction for this process is the same as that for the vector\ncase. The result for the vector case was found in [10] to be equal to the negative of the\nresult for the process for the scalars, which in turns is equal to the result for (6.1). This\nis again in perfect agreement with the string amplitude obtained in (6.9). This is our last\ntest.\nWe close this section with a comment about how the Z2 symmetry of the pp-wave\nbackground is realised in the string amplitudes of (6.5). It is known that under the Z2\nsymmetry the two indices of a fermion creation or annihilation operator are exchanged,\nZ2 : \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\u2192 \u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 . (6.14)\nHowever, whereas the string vertex |H3\u3009 is invariant under Z2, the true vacuum |v\u3009 cor-\nresponds to a combination of the trace of the metric and the five-form field on one of the\nR4\u2019s [55], and thus one has to assign negative Z2 parity to it [18, 23]. The correctness\nof this assignment was also verified from the field theory perspective in [10] (see also the\ndiscussion in the Introduction). If we apply (6.14) to the string amplitudes in (6.5) we\nobtain:\nZ\u02c62A1 \u2261 \u2212A4 = A1 ,\nZ\u02c62A2 \u2261 \u2212A2 = A2 ,\nZ\u02c62A3 \u2261 \u2212A3 = A3 ,\nZ\u02c62A4 \u2261 \u2212A1 = A4 . (6.15)\nTherefore, we conclude that the Z2 symmetry leaves the value of the string amplitudes of\n(6.1)-(6.4) invariant.\n14As before, in order to reach this conclusion we also used the fact that the anomalous dimension of\nall two-impurity operators, i.e. is the am,ny coefficient, is the same for any kind of impurity.\n24\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank Carlo Angelantonj, Andreas Brandhuber, Sanjaye Ramgoolam,\nRodolfo Russo, Bill Spence and in particular Valya Khoze for stimulating conversations.\nGG acknowledges a grant from the State Scholarship Foundation of Greece (I.K.Y.), and\nthe hospitality of Queen Mary College, London, where part of this work was carried out.\nThe work of GT was supported by PPARC.\n25\nAppendix A: Notation and conventions in gauge\ntheory\nWe write the Euclidean N = 4 Lagrangian as\nL = LB + LF , (A.1)\nwhere\nLB = 2\ng2\nTr\n(\n1\n4\nF\u00b5\u03bdF\u00b5\u03bd + (D\n\u00b5Z\u00af i)(D\u00b5Zi)\u2212 [Zi, Zj][Z\u00af i, Z\u00afj] + 1\n2\n[Zi, Z\u00af\ni][Zj, Z\u00af\nj]\n)\n, (A.2)\nand\nLF = 2\ng2\nTr\n(\n\u03bbA\u03c3\n\u00b5D\u00b5\u03bb\u00af\nA \u2212\n\u221a\n2i([\u03bb4, \u03bbi]Z\u00af\ni + [\u03bb\u00af4, \u03bb\u00afi]Zi) +\ni\u221a\n2\n(\u01ebijk[\u03bbi, \u03bbj]Zk + \u01ebijk[\u03bb\u00af\ni, \u03bb\u00afj ]Z\u00afk)\n)\n.\n(A.3)\nIn the above equation A = 1, . . . , 4 and i, j, k = 1, . . . , 3.

As is standard\nin the literature, we will choose a frame in which \u03b13 = \u22121,\n\u03b1r = \u03b1\n\u2032p+(r) : \u03b13 = \u22121, \u03b11 = y, \u03b12 = 1\u2212 y. (B.1)\nIn terms of the U(1) R-charges of the BMN operators in the gauge theory three-point\nfunction, \u3008OJ11 OJ22 O\u00afJ3 \u3009 we have\ny =\nJ1\nJ\n, 1\u2212 y = J2\nJ\n, y \u2208 (0, 1) , (B.2)\nand J = J1 + J2.\nThe effective SYM coupling constant (1.2) in the frame (B.1) takes the simple form\n\u03bb\u2032 =\n1\n(\u00b5p+\u03b1\u2032)2\n\u2261 1\n(\u00b5\u03b13)2\n=\n1\n\u00b52\n. (B.3)\nHere \u00b5 is the mass parameter which appears in the pp-wave metric, in the chosen frame\nit is dimensionless15 and the expansion in powers of 1\/\u00b52 is equivalent to the perturbative\nexpansion in \u03bb\u2032. Finally, the frequencies are defined via\n\u03c9rm =\n\u221a\nm2 + (\u00b5\u03b1r)2 . (B.4)\nThe three-string vertex |H3\u3009 can be represented as a ket-state in the tensor product\nof three single-string Fock spaces. It has the form [11,12]\n1\n\u00b5\n|H3\u3009 = P|VF \u3009|VB\u3009 \u03b4\n( 3\u2211\nr=1\n\u03b1r\n)\n, (B.5)\n15It is p+\u00b5 which is invariant under longitudinal boosts and is frame-independent.\n27\nwhere the kets |VB\u3009 and |VF \u3009 are constructed by requiring they satisfy the bosonic and\nfermionic kinematical symmetries, and \u03b1r are defined in (B.1). |VB\u3009 is given by\n|VB\u3009 = exp\n(\n1\n2\n3\u2211\nr,s=1\n\u221e\u2211\nm,n=\u2212\u221e\n8\u2211\nI=1\na(r) I\u2020m N\n(rs)\nmna\n(s) I\u2020\nn\n)\n|v\u30091|v\u30092|v\u30093 , (B.6)\nwhere the N\n(rs)\nmn are the Neumann matrices in the number operator basis.

The complete perturbative expansion\nof the Neumann matrices in the pp-wave background in the vicinity of \u00b5 = \u221e, was\nconstructed in [57]16. The vacuum state |v\u3009 \u2261 |v\u30091|v\u30092|v\u30093 is defined as the state which is\nannihilated by all a\u2019s and b\u2019s,\nan(r) |v\u3009r = 0 , bn(r) |v\u3009r = 0 , \u2200n . (B.8)\nThe prefactor P is determined by imposing the dynamical symmetries of the pp-wave\nsuperalgebra, and was derived in [23].

Full details about the expressions appearing in\n(B.9) can be found in the original paper [23] or, for instance, in the review [35]. We will\nonly need the following expressions:\nVij = \u03b4ij\n[\n1 +\n1\n12\n(Y 4 + Z4) +\n1\n144\nY 4Z4\n]\n\u2212 i\n2\n[\nY 2ij(1 +\n1\n12\nZ4)\u2212 Z2ij(1 +\n1\n12\nY 4)\n]\n+\n1\n4\n(Y 2Z2)ij , (B.10)\nVab = \u03b4ab\n[\n1\u2212 1\n12\n(Y 4 + Z4) +\n1\n144\nY 4Z4\n]\n\u2212 i\n2\n[\nY 2ab(1\u2212\n1\n12\nZ4)\u2212 Z2ab(1\u2212\n1\n12\nY 4)\n]\n+\n1\n4\n(Y 2Z2)ab , (B.11)\nwhere\nY \u03b1\u03b2 =\n3\u2211\nr=1\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nG\u00afn(r) b\n\u2020\u03b1\u03b2\nn(r) , Z\n\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9 =\n3\u2211\nr=1\n\u2211\nn\u22650\nG\u00afn(r) b\n\u2020\u03b1\u02d9\u03b2\u02d9\n\u2212n(r) , (B.12)\n16See also [59], and Appendix of [60] for some useful properties of the Neumann matrices.\n28\nY 2\u03b1\u03b2 := Y\u03b1\u03b3Y\n\u03b3\n\u03b2 , Y\n4 := Y 2\u03b1\u03b2(Y\n2)\n\u03b1\u03b2\n. (B.13)\nSimilar expressions hold for the Z\u2019s. The matrices G\u00afn(r) are given in (3.12) of [23]. Finally,\nthe overall normalisation Cnorm cannot be fixed by imposing the dynamical constraints,\nand is determined (once and for all) by requiring agreement with a single field theory\ncalculation. Its value will be taken to be:\nCnorm = \u2212g2\n2\n1\u221a\nJ\n1\u221a\ny(1\u2212 y) . (B.14)\nAppendix C: Summing over the BMN phase factors\nWe report here the expressions for the coefficients PI and PII which arise after summing\nover the BMN phase factors in the interacting diagrams derived in section 5.1. Defining\nq = e2piim\/J , q1 = e\n2piin\/J1 , (C.1)\nthe expressions for PI and PII are given by\nPI =\nJ1\u2211\nl=0\n(q\u00afq1)\nl q\u00af , PII =\nJ1\u2211\nl=0\n(q\u00afq1)\nl . (C.2)\nWe also need to evaluate the quantity 2(PI + P\u00afI)\u2212 2(PII + P\u00afII), which in the BMN limit\nis\n2(PI + P\u00afI)\u2212 2(PII + P\u00afII) = \u2212 8m\nm\u2212 n\/y sin\n2 \u03c0my . (C.3)\nAppendix D: The functions X, Y and H\nThe expressions for three-point functions of BMN operators with scalar, vector, mixed or\nfermion impurities involve the integral\nX1234 =\n\u222b\nd4z \u2206(x1 \u2212 z)\u2206(x2 \u2212 z)\u2206(x3 \u2212 z)\u2206(x4 \u2212 z) . (D.1)\nX1234 develops a log x\n2\n12 term X as x1 approaches x2, which repeatedly appears in section\n5.1. The expression for X is [20]\nX := X1234|x3=x4 =\nlog (x12\u039b)\n\u22121\n8\u03c02 (4\u03c02x231)\n2\n. (D.2)\n29\nAnother important function ubiquitously appearing in the calculations is\nY123 =\n\u222b\nd4z\u2206(x1 \u2212 z)\u2206(x2 \u2212 z)\u2206(x3 \u2212 z) . (D.3)\nIt is easy to realise that, as x12 \u2192 0, the function Y123 contains a logarithmic term given\nby\nY123|x12\u21920 = \u2212\n1\n24\u03c02\n\u2206(x13) log x\n2\n12 . (D.4)\nOne also needs the following expression for the log x212 term in the first derivative of Y :\n(\u22021\u03b1Y123)x12\u21920 =\n1\n25\u03c02\nlog x212 \u22023\u03b1\u2206(x13) . (D.5)\nNotice that (D.5) should be derived directly from (D.3) rather than by differentiating\n(D.4).\nIn the calculation, we also encounter the function H defined by\nH14,23 = (\u2202\nx1\n\u00b5 \u2212\u2202x4\u00b5 )(\u2202x2\u00b5 \u2212\u2202x3\u00b5 )\n\u222b\nd4z d4t \u2206(x1\u2212 z)\u2206(x4\u2212 z)\u2206(x2\u2212 t)\u2206(x3\u2212 t)\u2206(z\u2212 t) ,\n(D.6)\nwhich can be evaluated with the useful relation proved in [31]\nH14,23\n\u220614\u220623\n= X1234\n(\n1\n\u220612\u220643\n\u2212 1\n\u220613\u220624\n)\n+G1,23 \u2212G4,23 +G2,14 \u2212G3,14 , (D.7)\nwhere \u2206ij = \u2206(xi \u2212 xj) and\nGi,jk = Yijk\n(\n1\n\u2206ik\n\u2212 1\n\u2206ij\n)\n. (D.8)\nWe can recast (D.7) as\nH14,23 = \u2212X1234\u220614\u220623\n\u220613\u220624\n+\n(\nY123\n\u220613\n+\nY124\n\u220624\n)\n\u220614\u220623 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n= HI + HII + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (D.9)\nwhere the dots stand for terms which either vanish or do not contain the log x212.\nAppendix E: More detailed calculations for the\nevaluation of the Feynman diagrams\nThe three-point functions with fermion BMN operators discussed in section 5 are ex-\npressed in terms of JA, JB and JC defined in (5.21)-(5.23). Here we sketch the calculation\n30\nof the log(x212) parts of these quantities. Let us start by calculating the following integral:\nA = \u22021k\u2202\n4\nkH1432 =\n\u222b\nd4z d4t \u2202zk\u22061z \u2202\nz\nk\u22064z\u2206zt \u22062t\u22063t = (E.1)\n\u2212\n\u222b\nd4z d4t\u22061z\u0003z\u22064z \u2206zt\u22062t\u22063t \u2212\n\u222b\nd4z d4t\u22061z\u2202\nz\nk\u22064z \u2202\nz\nk\u2206zt \u22062t\u22063t .\nThe box acting on the propagator gives a delta function which eliminates the z integration,\ngiving a result proportional to Y234. Y234, however, does not contain any log x\n2\n12 term so\nfor our purposes this term can safely be ignored. Therefore we are left with:\nA =\n\u222b\nd4z d4t \u2202zk\u22061z \u22064z\u2202\nz\nk\u2206zt \u22062t\u22063t +\n\u222b\nd4z d4t\u22061z\u22064z\u0003z\u2206zt \u22062t\u22063t\n= \u2212\n\u222b\nd4z d4t\u0003z\u22061z \u22064z\u2206zt\u22062t\u22063t \u2212\n\u222b\nd4z d4t \u2202zk\u22061z \u2202\nz\nk\u22064z\u2206zt \u22062t\u22063t \u2212X1234\n= \u220614Y123 \u2212 A\u2212X1234 . (E.2)\nFrom the last expression one can obtain A:\nA =\n1\n2\n(\u2212X1234 +\u220614Y123) . (E.3)\nIn the above derivation , we have integrated by parts with respect to z several times, and\nwe used \u0003x\u2206(x) = \u2212\u03b4(x). Since the log x12 terms of X1234 and Y123 are well known (see\nAppendix D), the same is also true for A.\nUpon using the useful identity (\u22021\u00b5 + \u2202\n2\n\u00b5 + \u2202\n3\n\u00b5+ \u2202\n4\n\u00b5)H1423 = 0, and the expression for A\nderived above, one can evaluate (\u22023 \u00b7 \u22024 + \u22022 \u00b7 \u22024)H1423:\n(\u22022 + \u22023) \u00b7 \u22024H1423 = \u2212(\u22021 + \u22024) \u00b7 \u22024H1423 = \u2212A\u2212\u00034H1423 \u2192= \u2212A , (E.4)\nsince again \u00034 acting on H1423 does not give rise to a log x\n2\n12 term. One can also evaluate\nthe difference (\u22023 \u00b7 \u22024 \u2212 \u22022 \u00b7 \u22024)H1423 using\n\u2202i \u00b7 \u2202jH1423 = 1\n2\n(\u0003k + \u0003l \u2212\u0003i \u2212\u0003j)H1423 + \u2202k \u00b7 \u2202lH1423 , (E.5)\nwhere (E.5) holds for i 6= j 6= k 6= l.\nStarting from\nH14,23 = (\u2202\n1 \u2212 \u22024) \u00b7 (\u22022 \u2212 \u22023)H1423 , (E.6)\nsubstituting for \u22021 \u00b7 \u22022 and \u22021 \u00b7 \u22023 the corresponding expressions from (E.5), and solving\nfor (\u22023 \u00b7 \u22024 \u2212 \u22022 \u00b7 \u22024)H1423, we obtain:\n(\u22023 \u00b7 \u22024 \u2212 \u22022 \u00b7 \u22024)H1423 = 1\n2\n[\nH14,23 + (\u00032 \u2212\u00033)H1423\n]\n. (E.7)\n31\nNow, since the divergences of the right hand side of (E.7) are known [10], the divergence\nof (\u22023 \u00b7\u22024\u2212\u22022 \u00b7\u22024)H1423 is also known. In conclusion, we have computed the log x212 parts\nof (E.7) and (E.4). That means we can evaluate the log x212 parts of \u2202\n3 \u00b7 \u22024H1423 and\n\u22022 \u00b7 \u22024H1423 separately.\nWe are now in position to write down the expressions for the J \u2019s as functions of X1234,\nY123 and Y124. These are the following:\nJA = \u22121\n2\n(X1234 +\u220641Y123) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (E.8)\nJB = \u22121\n2\n(\u2212X1234 +\u220623Y124) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (E.9)\nJC =\n1\n4\n(\u2212\u220641Y123 \u2212X1234 +\u220623Y124 +H14,23) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (E.10)\nwhere the dots stand for terms which do not contain the log x212. H14,23 is given in (D.7).\nIn the evaluation of the diagrams involving the compensating term, we also made use of\nthe following relations:\n\u22024\u03bd\u2202\n3\n\u00b5X1234 |x3 = x4,x12\u21920 = \u2212\n1\n(4\u03c02)3\nx3\u00b5x3\u03bd\n(x23)\n4\nlog x212 , (E.11)\n\u22024\u03bd\u2202\n4\n\u00b5X1234 |x3=x4,x12\u21920 = \u220623\u22024\u03bd\u22024\u00b5Y124 |x3=x4,x12\u21920 (E.12)\n=\nlog x212\n2(4\u03c02)3(x23)\n3\n(\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 4x3\u00b5x3\u03bd\nx23\n)\n,\n\u22021\u03bdY123 |x3=x4,x12\u21920 =\n\u2212x3\u03bd\n26\u03c04(x23)\n2\nlog x212 , (E.13)\n\u22023\u03bdY123 |x3=x4,x12\u21920 =\nx3\u03bd\n25\u03c04(x23)\n2\nlog x212 .
