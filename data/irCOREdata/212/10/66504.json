Cole et al.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe near-infrared galaxy luminosity function is an impor-\ntant characteristic of the local galaxy population. It is a\nmuch better tracer of evolved stars, and hence of the total\nstellar content of galaxies, than optical luminosity functions\nwhich can be dominated by young stellar populations and\nare also strongly affected by dust extinction. Hence, infrared\nluminosities can be much more directly related to the un-\nderlying stellar mass of galaxies and so knowledge of the\npresent form and evolution of the infrared galaxy luminos-\nity function places strong constraints on the history of star\nformation in the universe and on galaxy formation models\n(e.g. Cole et al. 2000 and references therein).\nThe local K-band luminosity function has been es-\ntimated from optically selected samples by Mobasher,\nSharples and Ellis (1993), Szokoly et al. (1998) and Loveday\n(2000) and from K-band surveys by Glazebrook et al. (1995),\nand Gardner et al. (1997). The existing K-band surveys are\nsmall. The largest, by Gardner et al., covers only 4 deg2 and\ncontains only 510 galaxies. The recent survey of Loveday\ncovers a much larger solid angle. In this survey the redshifts\nwere known in advance of measuring the K-band magnitudes\nand this was exploited by targetting bright and faint galax-\nies resulting in an effective sample size much larger than the\n345 galaxies actually measured. However, like all optically\nselected samples, it suffers from the potential problem that\ngalaxies with extremely red infrared to optical colours could\nbe missed. In this paper we combine the 2-Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) with the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (2dF-\nGRS) to create an infrared selected redshift survey subtend-\ning 2151.6 deg2. Currently the sky coverage of both surveys\nis incomplete, but already the overlap has an effective area\nof 619 deg2. Within this area the redshift survey is com-\nplete to the magnitude limit of the 2MASS catalogue and so\nconstitutes a complete survey which is 50 times larger than\nthe previous largest published infrared selected redshift sur-\nvey. A new catalogue of a similarly large area, also based\non 2MASS, has very recently been analysed by Kochanek et\nal. (2001). They adopt isophotal rather than total magni-\ntudes and concentrate on the dependence of the luminosity\nfunction on galaxy morphology.\nIn Section 2.1 we briefly describe the relevant proper-\nties of the 2dFGRS and 2MASS catalogues. Section 2.2 is\na detailed examination of the degree to which the matched\n2MASS\u20132dFGRS galaxies are a complete and representative\nsubset of the 2MASS catalogue. Section 2.3 examines the\ncalibration of the 2MASS total magnitudes and Section 2.4\ndemonstrates that the 2MASS catalogue and the inferred\nluminosity functions are not affected by surface brightness\nselection effects. In Section 3 we present the method by\nwhich we compute k-corrections and evolutionary correc-\ntions and relate the observed luminosities to the underlying\nstellar mass. The estimation methods and normalization of\nthe luminosity functions are described briefly in Section 4.\nOur main results are presented and discussed in Section 5.\nThese include estimates of the J and KS (K-short) lumi-\nnosity functions, the bJ\u2212KS and J\u2212KS colour distributions\nas a function of absolute magnitude and the distribution\nof spectral type. We also estimate the stellar mass function\nof galaxies, which can be integrated to infer the fraction of\nbaryons in the universe which are in the form of stars. We\nconclude in Section 6.\n2 THE DATASET\nThe data that we analyze are the extended source cata-\nlogue from the second incremental release of the 2-Micron\nAll Sky Survey (2MASS http:\/\/pegasus.phast.umass.edu)\nand the galaxy catalogue of the 2dF galaxy redshift survey\n(2dFGRS http:\/\/www.mso.anu.edu.au\/2dFGRS). Here, we\npresent the relevant properties of these two catalogues and\ninvestigate their selection characteristics and level of com-\npleteness.\n2.1 Selection Criteria\nThe 2MASS is a ground-based, all-sky imaging survey in the\nJ, H and KS bands. Details of how extended sources are iden-\ntified and their photometric properties measured are given\nby Jarrett et al. (2000). The detection sensitivity (10\u03c3) for\nextended sources is quoted as 14.7, 13.9 and 13.1 magnitudes\nin J, H and KS respectively. The complete survey is expected\nto contain 1 million galaxies of which approximately 580,000\nare contained in the second incremental data release made\npublic in March 2000.\nThe 2dFGRS is selected in the photographic bJ\nband from the APM galaxy survey (Maddox et al.\n1990a,1990b,1996) and subsequent extensions to it, that\ninclude a region in the northern galactic cap (Maddox\net al. in preparation). The survey covers approximately\n2151.6 deg2 consisting of two broad declination strips.\nThe larger is centred on the SGP and approximately cov-\ners \u221222\u25e6.5>\u03b4>\u221237\u25e6.5, 21h40m<\u03b1<3h30m; the smaller strip\nis in the northern galactic cap and covers 2\u25e6.5>\u03b4>\u22127\u25e6.5,\n9h50m<\u03b1<14h50m. In addition, there are a number of ran-\ndomly located circular 2-degree fields scattered across the\nfull extent of the low extinction regions of the southern APM\ngalaxy survey. There are some gaps in the 2dFGRS sky cov-\nerage within these boundaries due to small regions that have\nbeen excluded around bright stars and satellite trails. The\n2dFGRS aims to measure the redshifts of all the galaxies\nwithin these boundaries with extinction-corrected bJ mag-\nnitudes brighter than 19.45. When complete, at the end of\n2001, 250,000 galaxy redshifts will have been measured. In\nthis paper we use the 140,000 redshifts obtained prior to\nSeptember 2000.\nThe overlap of the two surveys is very good. There are\nsome gaps in the sky coverage due to strips of the sky that\nwere not included in the 2MASS second incremental release,\nbut overall a substantial fraction of the 2151.6 deg2 of the\n2dFGRS is covered by 2MASS. The homogeneity and exten-\nsive sky coverage of the combined dataset make it ideal for\nstudies of the statistical properties of the galaxy population.\n2.2 The Completeness of the Matched\n2MASS\u20132dFGRS Catalogue\nHere we consider whether all the 2MASS galaxies within\nthe 2dFGRS survey region have 2dFGRS counterparts and\nassess the extent to which the fraction of galaxies with mea-\nsured redshifts represents an unbiased sub-sample.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 3\nFigure 1. The distribution of angular separation, \u03b8, for matched\n2MASS\u20132dFGRS galaxies. The solid histogram is the distribution\nfor the whole catalogue and the dotted histogram for the subset\nof 2MASS galaxies with semi-major axes larger than 12 arcsec.\nThe astrometry in both 2MASS and 2dFGRS is, in gen-\neral, very good and it is an easy matter to match objects in\nthe two catalogues. We choose to find the closest pairs within\na search radius equal to three quarters of the semi-major axis\nof the J-band image (denoted j r e in the 2MASS database).\nScaling the search radius in this way helps with the matching\nof large extended objects. This procedure results in the iden-\ntification of 2dFGRS counterparts for 40,121 of the 2MASS\nobjects, when at random one would only expect to find a\nhandful of such close pairs. Moreover, the distribution of\nseparations shown in Fig. 1 peaks at 0.5 arcsec, with only\n3% having separations greater than 3 arcsec. A significant\npart of this tail comes from the most extended objects as\nis evident from the dotted histogram in Fig. 1 which shows\nobjects with semi-major axes larger than 12 arcsec. Thus,\nwe can be very confident in these identifications.\nThe 40,121 2MASS objects for which we have found se-\ncure 2dFGRS counterparts amount to 88.6% of the 2MASS\nextended sources that fall within the boundary of the 2dF-\nGRS. As discussed below, a more restrictive criterion that\nincludes only sources fainter than J=12 that are confidently\nclassified as galaxies by 2MASS, increases the fraction with\n2dFGRS matches to 90.7%. The remaining 9.3% are missed\nfor well understood reasons (star-galaxy classification: 4.6%;\nmerged or close images: 4.4%; miscellaneous: 0.27%), none\nof which ought to introduce a bias. This is confirmed explic-\nitly, in the middle row of Fig. 2, by the close correspondence\nbetween the photometric properties of the missed 9.3% and\nthose of the larger matched sample. Hence, in estimating\nluminosity functions no significant bias will be introduced\nby assuming the matched sample to be representative of the\nfull population. Furthermore, the distribution shown in the\nbottom row of Fig. 2 shows that the subset of 17,173 galaxies\nfor which we have measured redshifts is a random sample of\nthe full matched 2MASS\u20132dFGRS catalogue. This summary\nis the result of a thorough investigation, which we describe\nin the remainder of this section, into the reasons why 11.4%\nof the 2MASS sources are missed and whether their omission\nintroduces a bias in the properties of the matched sample.\nWe first consider objects in the 2MASS catalogue which\nbased on their images and colours are not confidently clas-\nsified as galaxies. In the 2MASS database a high e score or\ng score indicates a high probability that the object is either\nnot an extended source or not a galaxy. A cc flag6=0 indicates\nan artifact or contaminated and\/or confused source. For de-\ntailed definitions of these parameters we refer the reader to\nJarrett et al. (2000). Rejecting all objects which have either\ne score>1.4, g score>1.4 or cc flag6=0 removes just 6.7% of\nthe total. However, removing these reduces significantly the\nfraction of the 2MASS sample that does not match with\nthe 2dFGRS catalogue, from 11.4% to 9.6%. Thus, it is\nlikely that about 30% of the 2MASS objects which have\ne score>1.4, g score>1.4 or cc flag6=0 are not galaxies.\nThe 2MASS may contain a tail of very red objects\nthat are too faint in the bJ-band to be included in the\nbJ<19.45 2dFGRS sample. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of\nbJ-J colours for the matched objects with J<14.7. (Here,\nthe J-band magnitude we are using is the default magni-\ntude denoted j m in the 2MASS database. In Section 2.3\nwe will consider the issue of what magnitude definition is\nmost appropriate for estimating the luminosity function.)\nThe vertical dashed line indicates the colour at which this\nsample starts to become incomplete due to the bJ<19.45\nmagnitude limit of 2dFGRS. The colour distribution cuts\noff sharply well before this limit, suggesting that any tail of\nmissed very red objects is extremely small. In other words\nthe 2dFGRS is sufficiently deep that even the reddest ob-\njects detected at the faintest limits of 2MASS ought to be\ndetected in 2dFGRS.\nIn the top row of Fig. 2 we compare the distributions\nof magnitude, colour and surface brightness for the matched\nand missed 2MASS objects. In general, the properties of the\nmissed subset overlap well with those of the much larger\nmatched subset. However, we do see that the distributions\nfor missed objects contain tails of bright and blue objects. It\nis quite likely that this is due to the 2MASS extended source\ncatalogue being contaminated by a small population of sat-\nurated or multiple stars. The dotted histograms in the top\nrow of Fig. 2 show the distributions of magnitude, colour\nand surface brightness for the bright subset of the missed\nobjects with J<12. Here we clearly see bimodal colour and\nsurface brightness distributions. The blue peak of the colour\ndistribution is consistent with that expected for stars (see\nJarrett et al. 2000). Excluding these bright, J<12, objects\nwhich are clearly contaminated by stars reduces the fraction\nof missed 2MASS objects from 9.6% to 9.3%. The magni-\ntude, colour and surface brightness distributions for this re-\nmaining 9.3% are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 2. We\nsee that the missed objects are slightly under-represented at\nthe faintest magnitudes and also slightly bluer on average\nthan the matched sample, while the distribution of surface\nbrightness is almost indistinguishable for the two sets of ob-\njects. These differences are small and so will introduce no\nsignificant bias in our luminosity function estimates.\nTo elucidate the reasons for the remaining missed 9.3%\nof 2MASS objects we downloaded 100 1\u00d71 arcmin images\nfrom the STScI Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) centred on the\npositions of a random sample of the missed 2MASS objects.\nIn each image we plotted a symbol to indicate the position of\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 S.

We also\nplotted symbols to indicate the positions and classifications\nof all images identified in the APM scans from which the\n2dFGRS catalogue was drawn, down to a magnitude limit\nof bJ\u2248 20.5. These images are classified as galaxies, stars,\nmerged images (galaxy+galaxy, galaxy+star or star+star)\nor noise. This set of plots allows us to perform a census of\nthe reasons why some 2MASS objects are not present in the\n2dFGRS survey.\nThe main cause for the absence of 2MASS objects in\nthe 2dFGRS is that the APM has classified these objects as\nstars. These amount to 49.5% of the missed sample (4.6%\nof the full 2MASS sample). In some cases, the DSS image\nshows clearly that these are stars and in others that they\nare galaxies. However, the majority of these objects cannot\neasily be classified from the DSS images. Thus, they could\nbe galaxies that the APM has falsely classified as stars or\nstars that 2MASS has falsely classified as galaxies. The first\npossibility is not unexpected since the parameters used in\nthe APM star-galaxy separation algorithm were chosen as\na compromise between high completeness and low contami-\nnation such that the expected completeness is around 95%\nwith 5% stellar contamination (Maddox et al. 1990a). It is\nhard to rule out the possibility that this class of object does\nnot include a substantial fraction of stars, but if so, their\npresence appears not to distort the distribution of colours\nshown in Fig 3. Another 47.6% of the random sample (4.4%\nof the full 2MASS sample) are classified by the APM as\nmergers or else consist of two close images in the DSS but\nare classified by the APM as a single galaxy offset from the\n2MASS position. The remaining 2.9% of the random sample\n(0.27% of the full 2MASS sample) are missed for a variety of\nreasons including proximity to the diffraction spikes of very\nbright stars and poor astrometry caused by the presence of\na neighbouring unclassified image.\nFigure 4.

In the previous\nsection we used the default magnitudes (denoted j m and\nk m in the 2MASS database). These are magnitudes de-\nfined within the same circular aperture in each waveband.\nFor galaxies brighter than KS=14, the aperture is the cir-\ncular KS-band isophote of 20 mag arcsec\n\u22122 and for galax-\nies fainter than KS=14 it is the circular J-band isophote of\n21 mag arcsec\u22122. These are not the most useful definitions\nof magnitude for determining the galaxy luminosity func-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 S. Cole et al.\nFigure 5.

The left\nhand panels are for the KS-band Kron and extrapolated magnitudes (k m e and k m ext in the 2MASS database). The right hand panels\nshow Kron and extrapolated magnitudes inferred from the 2MASS J-band Kron and extrapolated magnitudes and the measured default\naperture J\u2212KS colours (j m e\u2212j m+k m and j m ext\u2212j m+k m in the 2MASS database variables). The horizontal errorbars show the\nmeasurement errors quoted by Loveday (2000). The solid lines show simple least squares fits. The slopes and zero-point offsets of these fits\nand the rms residuals about the fits are indicated on each panel. The inset plots show the distribution of residual magnitude differences.\ntion. Since we are interested in measuring the total lumi-\nnosity and ultimately the total stellar mass of each galaxy,\nwe require a magnitude definition that better represents the\ntotal flux emitted by each galaxy. We consider Kron magni-\ntudes (Kron 1980) and extrapolated magnitudes. Kron mag-\nnitudes (denoted j m e and k m e in the 2MASS database)\nare measured within an aperture, the Kron radius, defined\nas 2.5 times the intensity-weighted radius of the image. The\nextrapolated magnitudes (denoted j m ext and k m ext in\nthe 2MASS database) are defined by first fitting a modified\nexponential profile, f(r) = f0 exp[\u2212(\u03b1r)\n1\/\u03b2], to the image\nfrom 10 arcsec to the 20 mag\/arcsec2 isophotal radius, and\nextrapolating this from the Kron radius to 4 times this ra-\ndius or 80 arcsec if this is smaller (Jarrett private commu-\nnication). Note that improvements are being made to the\nextended source photometry algorithms developed and em-\nployed 2MASS team and so in the final 2MASS data release\nthe definitions of the Kron and extrapolated magnitudes\nmay be slightly modified (Jarrett private communication).\nFig. 4 compares the default, Kron and extrapolated\nmagnitudes in the J and KS bands for the matched 2MASS\u2013\n2dFGRS catalogue. The upper panel shows that while the\nmedian offset between the J-band isophotal default magni-\ntudes and the pseudo-total Kron magnitudes is small there is\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 7\na large spread with some galaxies having default magnitudes\nmore than 0.5 magnitudes fainter than the Kron magnitude.\nThe Kron magnitudes are systematically fainter than the\nextrapolated magnitudes by between approximately 0.1 and\n0.3 magnitudes. This offset is rather larger than expected: if\nthe Kron radius is computed using a faint isophote to define\nthe extent of the image from which the intensity weighted\nradius is measured, then the Kron magnitudes should be\nvery close to total. For an exponential light profile (\u03b2 = 1),\nthe Kron radius should capture 96% of the flux, while for\nan r1\/4 law (\u03b2 = 4), 90% of the flux should be enclosed.\nIn other words, the Kron magnitude should differ from the\ntotal magnitude by only 0.044 and 0.11 magnitudes in these\ntwo cases. However, the choice of isophote is a compro-\nmise between depth and statistical robustness. In the case\nof the 2MASS second incremental release, an isophote of\n21.7(20.0) mag arcsec\u22122 in J(KS) was adopted (Jarrett pri-\nvate communication). These relatively bright isophotes, par-\nticularly the KS-band isophote, could lead to underestimates\nof the Kron radii and fluxes for lower surface brightness ob-\njects and plausibly accounts for much of the median offset\nof 0.3 magnitudes seen in Fig. 4 between the KS-band Kron\nand extrapolated magnitudes. This line of reasoning favours\nadopting the extrapolated magnitudes as the best estimate\nof the total magnitudes, but, on the other hand, the ex-\ntrapolated magnitudes are model-dependent and have larger\nmeasurement errors.\nTo understand better the offset and scatter in the\n2MASS magnitudes we have compared a subset of the\n2MASS data with the independent K-band photometry of\nLoveday (2000). The pointed observations of Loveday have\nbetter resolution than the 2MASS images and good signal-\nto-noise to a much deeper isophote. This enables accurate,\nunbiased Kron magnitudes to be measured. Note that the\noffset between the 2MASS KS-band and the standard K-\nband used by Loveday is expected to be almost completely\nnegligible (see Carpenter 2001). The left hand panels of\nFig. 5 compare these measurements with the corresponding\n2MASS Kron and extrapolated magnitudes. The right hand\npanels show KS-band Kron and extrapolated magnitudes\ncomputed by taking the 2MASS J-band Kron and extrap-\nolated magnitudes and subtracting the J\u2212KS colour mea-\nsured within the default aperture. These indirect estimates\nare interesting to consider as they combine the profile infor-\nmation from the deeper J-band image with the J\u2212KS colour\nmeasured within the largest aperture in which there is good\nsignal-to-noise. The straight lines plotted in Fig. 5 show sim-\nple least squares fits and the slope and zero-point offset of\nthese fits are indicated on each panel along with bootstrap\nerror estimates. Also shown in the inset panels is the distri-\nbution of residual magnitude differences about each of the\nfits and a gaussian fit to this distribution. The rms of these\nresiduals and a bootstrap error estimate is also given in each\npanel.\nFrom these comparisons we first see that all the fits\nhave slopes entirely consistent with unity, but that their ze-\nropoints and scatters vary. The zero-point offsets, \u2206Kroncal , be-\ntween both the 2MASS Kron magnitude measurements and\nthose of Loveday confirm that the 2MASS Kron magnitudes\nsystematically underestimate the galaxy luminosities. In the\ncase of the direct KS-band 2MASS magnitudes the offset is\n\u2206Kroncal = 0.164 magnitudes. In the case of the Kron magni-\ntudes inferred from the deeper J-band image profiles, the off-\nset is reduced to \u2206Kroncal = 0.061 magnitudes. Conversely the\n2MASS extrapolated magnitudes are systematically brighter\nthan the Loveday Kron magnitudes by \u2212\u2206extrap.\ncal\n= 0.137\nand 0.158 magnitudes, where one would expect an offset of\nonly \u2206Kron = 0.044 to 0.11 due to the difference in definition\nbetween ideal Kron and true total magnitudes. For both es-\ntimates of the extrapolated magnitude and for the directly\nestimated Kron magnitude the scatter about the correlation\nis approximately 0.14 magnitudes and we note a slight ten-\ndency for the scatter to increase at faint magnitudes. The\nmagnitude estimate that best correlates with the Loveday\nmeasurements is the Kron magnitude estimated from the\n2MASS J-band Kron magnitude and the default aperture\nJ\u2212KS colour. Here the distribution of residuals has a much\nreduced scatter of only 0.1 magnitudes and has very few\noutliers.\nOur conclusions from the comparison of Kron magni-\ntudes is that it is preferable to adopt the KS-band magni-\ntude inferred from the J-band Kron or extrapolated mag-\nnitude by converting to the KS-band using default aper-\nture colour, rather than to use the noisier and more bi-\nased direct KS-band estimates. With this definition, we find\nthat the 2MASS Kron magnitudes slightly underestimate\nthe galaxy luminosities while the extrapolated magnitudes\nslightly overestimate the luminosities, particularly at faint\nfluxes. We will present results for both magnitude defini-\ntions, but we note that to convert to total magnitudes we es-\ntimate that the 2MASS Kron magnitudes should be bright-\nened by \u2206Kroncal + \u2206Kron = 0.1\u20130.17 magnitudes and the\nextrapolated magnitudes dimmed by \u2212\u2206extrap.cal \u2212 \u2206Kron =\n0.05\u20130.11 magnitudes.\n2.4 Completeness of the 2MASS Catalogue\nHere we define the magnitude limited samples which we\nwill analyze in Section 4 and test them for possible incom-\npleteness in both magnitude and surface brightness. For the\nKron and extrapolated magnitudes, the 2MASS catalogue\nhas high completeness to the nominal limits of J<14.7 and\nKS<13.9. However, to ensure very high completeness and\navoid any bias in our luminosity function estimates, we made\nthe following more conservative cuts. For the Kron magni-\ntudes, we limited our sample to either J<14.45 or KS<13.2,\nand for the extrapolated magnitudes to either J<14.15 or\nKS<12.9. These choices are motivated by plots such as the\ntop panel of Fig. 4. Here the isophotal default magnitude\nlimit of J<14.7 is responsible for the right hand edge to the\ndistribution of data points. One sees that this limit begins\nto remove objects from the distribution of Kron magnitudes\nfor J>\u223c14.5. An indication that the survey is complete to our\nadopted limits is given by the number counts shown in Fig 6,\nwhich only begin to roll over at fainter magnitudes.\nMore rigorously, we have verified that the samples are\ncomplete to these limits by examining their V (zi)\/V (zmax,i)\ndistributions. Here, zi is the redshift of a galaxy in the sam-\nple, zmax,i is the maximum redshift at which this galaxy\nwould satisfy the sample selection criteria, and V (z) is the\nsurvey volume that lies at redshift less than z. If the sam-\nple is complete and of uniform density, V (zi)\/V (zmax,i) is\nuniformly distributed within the interval 0 to 1. To evaluate\nzmax we made use of the default k+e corrections described\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 S. Cole et al.\nFigure 6. Differential galaxy number counts in the J and KS\nbands, all with Poisson errorbars and with a Euclidean slope sub-\ntracted so as to expand the scale of the ordinate. The J and KS\ncounts linked by the solid line are the 2MASS 7 arcsec aperture\ncounts of Jarrett et al. (in preparation). The counts linked by\nthe dashed and dotted lines are those of the 2MASS\u20132dFGRS\nredshift catalogue for Kron and extrapolated magnitudes respec-\ntively. The KS-band magnitudes are those inferred from the J-\nband magnitudes and aperture colours. In the KS-band these are\ncompared with the counts of Gardner et al. (1996) and Glaze-\nbrook et al. (1994) as indicated in the figure legend.\nin the following section, but the results are not sensitive to\nreasonable variations in the assumed corrections or in the\ncosmology. The solid histograms in Fig. 7 show these dis-\ntributions for each of our four magnitude limited samples.\nNote that the KS-band magnitudes are those inferred from\nthe J-band magnitudes and aperture colours. The dashed\nhistograms in the lower panels show the corresponding dis-\ntributions for the directly measured KS-band magnitudes.\nIn all these cases we have computed Vmax simply from the\nimposed apparent magnitude limits and have ignored any\npossible dependence of the catalogue completeness on sur-\nface brightness.\nIf the samples were incomplete the symptom one would\nexpect to see is a deficit in the V\/Vmax distributions at\nlarge V\/Vmax and hence a mean \u3008V\/Vmax\u3009<0.5. There is\nno evidence for such a deficit in these distributions. In fact\neach has a mean \u3008V\/Vmax\u3009 slightly greater than 0.5. The\nslight gradient in the V\/Vmax distribution is directly re-\nlated to the galaxy number counts shown in Fig 6, which\nare slightly steeper than expected for a homogeneous, non-\nFigure 7.

A similar result has been found\nin the bright bJ-band counts (Maddox et al. 1990c). The\nbJ-band result has variously been interpreted as evidence\nfor rapid evolution, systematic errors in the magnitude cal-\nibration, or a local hole or underdensity in the galaxy dis-\ntribution (Maddox et al. 1990c; Metcalfe, Fong & Shanks\n1995; Shanks 1990). Here we note that the gradient in the\nV\/Vmax distributions (and also in the galaxy counts) be-\ncomes steeper both as one switches from Kron to the less re-\nliable extrapolated magnitudes and as one switches from the\nJ-band data to the lower signal-to-noise KS-band data. This\ngives strong support to our decision to adopt the KS-band\nmagnitudes derived from the J-band Kron and extrapolated\nmagnitudes and aperture J\u2212KS colours. It also cautions that\nthe mean \u3008V\/Vmax\u3009>0.5 cannot necessarily be taken as a\nsign of evolution or a local underdensity, but may instead be\nrelated to the accuracy of the magnitude measurements. The\ncomparison to the observations of Loveday (2000) shows no\nevidence for systematic errors in the magnitudes, but does\nnot constrain the possibility that the distribution of magni-\ntude measurement errors may become broader or skewed at\nfainter magnitudes. Such variations would affect the V\/Vmax\ndistributions and could produce the observed behaviour. We\nconclude by noting that while the shift in the mean \u3008V\/Vmax\u3009\nis statistically significant, it is nevertheless quite small for\nthe samples we analyze and has little effect on the resulting\nluminosity function estimates.\nWe now investigate explicitly the degree to which the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 9\nFigure 8. The points show the distribution of estimated cen-\ntral surface brightness, \u00b50, and absolute magnitude, MJ, for our\nJ< 14.45 (Kron) sample. The contours show visibility theory es-\ntimates of Vmax as a function of \u00b50 and MJ. The contours are\nlabelled by their Vmax values in units of (Mpc\/h)3.\ncompleteness of the 2MASS catalogue depends on surface\nbrightness by estimating Vmax as a function of both abso-\nlute magnitude and surface brightness. This is an impor-\ntant issue: if the catalogue is missing low-surface brightness\ngalaxies our estimates of the luminosity function will be bi-\nased. The approach we have taken follows that developed in\nCross et al. (2001) for the 2dFGRS. We estimate an effec-\ntive central surface brightness, \u00b5z0, for each observed galaxy\nassuming an exponential light distribution, that the Kron\nmagnitudes are total and that the Kron radii are exactly\nfive exponential scale-lengths. This is then corrected to red-\nshift z = 0 using\n\u00b50 = \u00b5\nz\n0 \u2212 10 log(1 + z)\u2212 k(z)\u2212 e(z) (2.1)\nto account for redshift dimming and k+e corrections (c.f\nSection 3). Note that in the 2MASS catalogue, galaxies with\nestimated Kron radii less than 7 arcsec, have their Kron radii\nset to 7 arcsec. This will lead us to underestimate the central\nsurface brightnesses of these galaxies, but this will only affect\nhigh surface brightness objects and will not affect whether a\ngalaxy can or cannot be seen. The distribution in theMJ\u2013\u00b50\nplane of our Kron J-band selected sample is shown by the\npoints in Fig. 8.\nCross et al. (2001) use two different methods to esti-\nmate the value of Vmax associated with each position in\nthis plane. The first method uses the visibility theory of\nPhillipps, Davies & Disney (1990). We model the selection\ncharacteristics of the 2MASS extended source catalogue by\na set of thresholds. The values appropriate in the J-band are\na minimum isophotal diameter of 8.5 arcsec at an isophote\nof 20.5 mag arcsec\u22122, and an isophotal magnitude limit of\nJ<14.7 at an isophote of 21.0 mag arcsec\u22122 (Jarrett et al.\n2000). In addition, we impose the limits in the Kron magni-\ntude of 11<J<14.45 that define the sample we analyze. We\nthen calculate for each point on the MJ\u2013\u00b50 plane the red-\nshift at which a such a galaxy will drop below one or other\nof these selection thresholds and hence compute a value of\nVmax. The results of this procedure are shown by the con-\ntours of constant Vmax plotted in Fig. 8. Note that these\nestimates of Vmax are only approximate since we have made\nthe crude assumption that all the galaxies are circular expo-\nFigure 9.

(2000)\nrespectively.\nnential disks. In addition, the diameter and isophotal limits\nare only approximate and vary with observing conditions.\nThe second method developed by Cross et al. (2001)\nconsists of making an empirical estimate of Vmax in bins in\nthe MJ\u2013\u00b50 plane. They look at the distribution of observed\nredshifts in a given bin and adopt the 90th percentile of this\ndistribution to define zmax and hence Vmax. It is more robust\nto use the 90th percentile rather than the 100th percentile\nand the effect of this choice can easily be compensated for\nwhen estimating the luminosity function (Cross et al. 2001).\nNote that in our application to the 2MASS data we do not\napply corrections for incompleteness or the effects of clus-\ntering. The result of this procedure is to confirm that for\nthe populated bins, the Vmax values given by the visibility\ntheory are a good description of the data.\nIn Fig. 8 we see that the distribution of galaxies in the\nMJ\u2013\u00b50 plane is well separated from the low surface bright-\nness limit of approximately 20.5 mag arcsec\u22122 where the\nVmax contours indicate that the survey has very little sen-\nsitivity. Thus, there is no evidence that low-surface bright-\nness galaxies are missing from the 2MASS catalogue. Fur-\nthermore, in the region occupied by the observed data, the\nVmax contours are close to vertical indicating that there is\nlittle dependence of Vmax on surface brightness. The way in\nwhich the V\/Vmax distribution is modified by including this\nestimate of the surface brightness dependence is shown by\nthe dotted histogram in the top-left panel of Fig. 7. Its ef-\nfect is to increase the mean V\/Vmax slightly, suggesting that\nthis estimate perhaps overcorrects for the effect of surface\nbrightness selection. Even so, the change in the estimated\nluminosity function is negligible as confirmed by the three\nestimates of the Kron J-band luminosity function shown in\nFig. 9. These are all simple 1\/Vmax estimates, but with Vmax\ncomputed either ignoring surface brightness effects or using\none of the two methods described above. These luminosity\nfunctions differ negligibly, indicating that no bias is intro-\nduced by ignoring surface brightness selection effects.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 S.

The\nmodel prediction is very insensitive to the assumed k+e correction\nand cosmology.\n3 MODELLING THE STELLAR\nPOPULATIONS\nThe primary aim of this paper is to determine the present-\nday J and KS-band luminosity functions and also the stellar\nmass function of galaxies. Since the 2MASS survey spans a\nrange of redshift (see Fig. 10), we must correct for both the\nredshifting of the filter bandpass (k-correction) and for the\neffects of galaxy evolution (e-correction). In practice, the k\nand e-corrections at these wavelengths are both small and\nuncertainties in them have little effect on the estimated lu-\nminosity functions. This is because these infrared bands are\nnot dominated by young stars and also because the 2MASS\nsurvey does not probe a large range of redshift. We have cho-\nsen to derive individual k and e-corrections for each galaxy\nusing the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual &\nCharlot (1993; 2001 in preparation). We have taken this ap-\nproach not because such detailed modelling is necessary to\nderive robust luminosity functions, but because it enables\nus to explore the uncertainties in the derived galaxy stellar\nmass functions, which are, in fact, dominated by uncertain-\nties in the properties of the stellar populations.\nThe latest models of Bruzual & Charlot (2001 in prepa-\nration) provide, for a variety of different stellar initial mass\nfunctions (IMFs), the spectral energy distribution (SED),\nl\u03bb(t, Z), of a single population of stars formed at the same\ntime with a single metallicity, as a function of both age, t,\nand metallicity, Z. We convolve these with an assumed star\nformation history, \u03c8(t\u2032), to compute the time-evolving SED\nof the model galaxy,\nL\u03bb(t) =\n\u222b t\n0\nl\u03bb(t\u2212 t\n\u2032, Z) \u03c8(t\u2032) dt\u2032. (3.1)\nWe take account of the effect of dust extinction on the SEDs\nusing the Ferrara et al. (1999) extinction model normalized\nso that the V-band central face-on optical depth of the Milk-\nWay is 10. This value corresponds to the mean optical depth\nof L\u22c6 galaxies in the model of Cole et al. (2000) which em-\nploys the same model of dust extinction. We assume a typi-\ncal inclination angle of 60 degrees which yields a net atten-\nuation factor of 0.53 in the V-band and 0.78 in the J-band.\nFigure 11. The points in the upper two panels show the observed\ndistributions of J-KS and bJ-KScolours as a function of redshift\nfor our matched 2MASS-2dFGRS catalogue with z < 0.2 and\nJ< 14.45 (Kron). Overlaid on these points are some examples of\nmodel tracks. The solid curves are for solar metallicity, Z = 0.02,\nand the dashed curves for Z = 0.004. Within each set, the tracks\nshow different choices of the star formation time scale, \u03c4 . The grid\nof values we use has \u03c4 =1, 3, 5, 10 and 50 Gyr. Shorter values of \u03c4\nlead to older stellar populations and redder colours. The bottom\npanel shows the k+e corrections in the J-band for these same sets\nof tracks.\nBy varying the assumed metallicity, Z, and star formation\nhistory, we build up a two-dimensional grid of models. Then,\nfor each of these models, we extract tracks of bJ\u2212KS and\nJ\u2212KS colours and stellar mass-to-light ratio as a function of\nredshift.\nOur standard set of tracks assumes a cosmological\nmodel with \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7, Hubble constant H0 = 70\nkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, and star formation histories with an expo-\nnential form, \u03c8(t) \u221d exp(\u2212[t(z)\u2212 t(zf)]\/\u03c4 ). Here, t(z) is the\nage of the Universe at redshift z and the galaxy is assumed\nto start forming stars at zf = 20 . For these tracks, we adopt\nthe Kennicutt IMF (Kennicutt 1983) and include the dust\nextinction model. The individual tracks are labelled by a\nmetallicity, Z, which varies from Z = 0.0001 to Z = 0.05 and\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 11\na star formation timescale, \u03c4 , which varies from \u03c4 = 1 Gyr to\n\u03c4 = 50 Gyr. Examples of these tracks are shown in Fig. 11,\nalong with the observed redshifts and colours of the 2MASS\ngalaxies. We can see that the infrared J\u2212KS colour depends\nmainly on metallicity while the bJ\u2212KS colour depends both\non metallicity and star formation timescale. Thus, the use\nof both colours allows a unique track to be selected. Note\nfrom the bottom panel that, for all the tracks, the k+e cor-\nrection is always small for the range of redshift spanned by\nour data.\nWe can gauge how robust our results are by varying the\nassumptions of our model. In particular, we vary the IMF,\nthe dust extinction and cosmological models, and include or\nexclude the evolutionary contribution to the k+e correction.\nAlso, we consider power-law star formation histories, \u03c8(t) \u221d\n[t(z)\/t(zf)]\n\u2212\u03b3 , as an alternative to the exponential model.\nThe results are discussed at beginning of Section 5.\nThe procedure for computing the individual galaxy k+e\ncorrections is straightforward. At the measured redshift of a\ngalaxy, we find the model whose bJ\u2212KS and J\u2212KS colours\nmost closely match that of the observed galaxy. Having se-\nlected the model we then follow it to z = 0 to predict the\ngalaxy\u2019s present-day J and KS-band luminosities and also\nits total stellar mass. We also use the model track to follow\nits k+e correction to higher redshift in order to compute\nzmax, the maximum redshift at which this galaxy would have\npassed the selection criteria for inclusion into the analysis\nsample.\n4 LUMINOSITY FUNCTION ESTIMATION\nWe use both the simple 1\/Vmax method and standard max-\nimum likelihood methods to estimate luminosity functions.\nWe present Schechter function fits computed using the STY\nmethod (Sandage, Tammann & Yahil 1978) and also non-\nparametric estimates using the stepwise maximum like-\nlihood method (SWML) of Efstathiou, Ellis & Peterson\n(1988). Our implementation of each of these methods is de-\nscribed and tested in Norberg et al. (2001). The advantage\nof the maximum likelihood methods is that they are not\naffected by galaxy clustering (provided that the galaxy lu-\nminosity function is independent of galaxy density). By con-\ntrast the 1\/Vmax method, which makes no assumption about\nthe dependence of the luminosity function with density, is\nsubject to biases produced by density fluctuations.\nThe two maximum likelihood methods determine the\nshape of the luminosity function, but not its overall normal-\nization. We have chosen to normalize the luminosity func-\ntions by matching the galaxy number counts of Jarrett et\nal. (in preparation). These were obtained from a 184 deg2\narea selected to have low stellar density and in which all\nthe galaxy classifications have all been confirmed by eye.\nThe counts are reproduced in Fig. 6. By using the same\n7 arcsec aperture magnitudes as Jarrett et al. (in prepara-\ntion) and scaling the galaxy counts in our redshift survey,\nwe deduce that the effective area of our redshift catalogue is\n619 \u00b1 25 deg2. Note that normalizing in this way by-passes\nthe problem of whether or not some fraction of the missed\n2MASS objects are stars. Fig. 6 also shows the Kron and\nextrapolated magnitude J and KS counts of the 2MASS\u2013\n2dFGRS redshift survey. In the lower panel, these counts are\nseen to be in agreement with the published K-band counts\nof Gardner et al. (1996) and Glazebrook et al. (1994).\nWe also checked the normalization using the following\nindependent estimate of the effective solid angle of the red-\nshift survey. For galaxies in the 2dFGRS parent catalogue\nbrighter than bJ< Blimit, we computed the fraction that\nhave both measured redshifts and match a 2MASS galaxy.\nFor a faint Blimit this fraction is small as the 2dFGRS cat-\nalogue is much deeper than the 2MASS catalogue, but as\nBlimit is made brighter, the fraction asymptotes to the frac-\ntion of the area of the 2dFGRS parent catalogue covered by\nthe joint 2MASS\u20132dFGRS redshift survey. By this method\nwe estimate that the effective area of our redshift catalogue\nis 642 \u00b1 22 deg2, which is in good agreement with the esti-\nmate from the counts of Jarrett et al. .\nIt should be noted that for neither of these estimates\nof the effective survey area do the quoted uncertainties take\naccount of variations in the number counts due to large scale\nstructure. To estimate the expected variation in the galaxy\nnumber counts within the combined 2MASS-2dFGRS sur-\nvey due to large scale structure we constructed an ensemble\nof mock catalogues from the \u039bCDM Hubble volume simula-\ntion of the VIRGO consortium (Evrard 1998; Evrard et al.\nin preparation; http:\/\/www.physics.lsa.umich.edu\/hubble-\nvolume). Mock 2dFGRS catalogues\nconstructed from the VIRGO Hubble Volume simulations\n(Baugh et al. in preparation) can be found at http:\/\/star-\nwww.dur.ac.uk\/\u02dccole\/mocks\/hubble.html . We simply took\nthese catalogues and sampled them to the depth of 2MASS\nover a solid angle of 619 deg2. To this magnitude limit we\nfound an rms variation in the number of galaxies of 15%. We\ntook this to be a realistic estimate of the uncertainty in the\n2MASS number counts and propagated this error through\nwhen computing the error on the normalization of the lumi-\nnosity function.\n5 RESULTS\n5.1 Luminosity Functions\nFig. 12 shows SWML estimates of the Kron J and KS lumi-\nnosity functions. The points with errorbars show results for\nour default choice of k+e corrections, namely those obtained\nfor an \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7, H0 = 70 km s\n\u22121 Mpc\u22121 cosmol-\nogy with a Kennicutt IMF and including dust extinction.\nThe figure also illustrates that the luminosity functions are\nvery robust to varying this set of assumptions. The various\ncurves in each plot are estimates made neglecting dust ex-\ntinction and\/or switching to a Salpeter IMF and\/or chang-\ning the Hubble constant to H0 = 50 km s\n\u22121Mpc\u22121 and\/or\nadopting power-law star formation histories and\/or making\na k-correction but no evolution correction. The systematic\nshifts caused by varying these assumptions are all compara-\nble with or smaller than the statistical errors. The biggest\nshift results from applying or neglecting the evolutionary\ncorrection. In terms of the characteristic luminosity in the\nSTY Schechter function fit, the estimates which include evo-\nlutionary corrections are 0.05 to 0.1 magnitudes fainter than\nthose that only include k-corrections (see Table 1).\nIn Fig. 13 we compare 1\/Vmax and SWML Kron lumi-\nnosity function estimates (for our default choice of k+e cor-\nrections) with STY Schechter function estimates. In general,\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 S. Cole et al.\nFigure 12. SWML estimates of the Kron magnitude J (left) and KS-band (right) luminosity functions (points with error bars). Our\ndefault model of k+e corrections (Kennicutt IMF and standard dust extinction) is adopted.

We tabulate the SWML estimates in Table 2. Integrat-\ning over the luminosity function gives luminosity densities\nin the J and KS-bands of \u03c1J = (2.75\u00b10.41)\u00d710\n8hL\u2299Mpc\n\u22123\nand \u03c1KS = (5.74\u00b10.86)\u00d710\n8hL\u2299Mpc\n\u22123 respectively, where\nwe have adopted M\u2299J = 3.73 and M\n\u2299\nKS\n= 3.39 (Allen 1973;\nJohnson 1966). In this analysis, we have not taken account\nof the systematic and random measurement errors in the\ngalaxy magnitudes. In the case of the STY estimate, the\nrandom measurement errors can be accounted for by fitting\na Schechter function which has been convolved with the dis-\ntribution of magnitude errors. However, for the Kron magni-\ntudes, the rms measurement error is only 0.1 magnitudes, as\nindicated by the comparison in the top right hand panel of\nFig 5, and such a convolution has only a small effect on the\nresulting Schechter function parameters. We find that the\nonly parameter that is affected isM\u22c6 which becomes fainter\nby just \u2206conv = 0.02 magnitudes. The comparison to the\nLoveday (2000) data also indicates a systematic error in the\n2MASS Kron magnitudes of \u2206Kroncal = 0.061\u00b10.031. Combin-\ning these two systematic errors results in a net brightening of\nM\u22c6 by \u2206Kroncal \u2212\u2206conv = 0.041 \u00b1 0.031 magnitudes. As this\nnet systematic error is both small and uncertain we have\nchosen not to apply a correction to our quoted Kron mag-\nnitude luminosity function parameters. We recall also that\nto convert from Kron to total magnitudes requires bright-\neningM\u22c6 by between \u2206Kron = 0.044 and 0.11 depending on\nwhether the luminosity profile of a typical galaxy is fit well\nby an exponential or r1\/4-law.\nFig. 14 shows the SWML and STY luminosity func-\ntion estimates for samples defined by the 2MASS extrapo-\nlated, rather than Kron, magnitudes. With this definition\nof magnitude, the luminosity functions differ significantly\nfrom those estimated using Kron magnitudes. In particular,\nthe characteristic luminosities are 0.34 and 0.28 magnitudes\nbrighter in J and KS respectively.

Note that\neven in the KS-band, it is this J-band offset that is relevant\nas the KS-band magnitudes we use are derived from the J-\nband values using the measured aperture colours. We have\nargued in Section 2.3 that this offset is caused by the J-band\nKron 2MASS magnitudes being fainter than true total mag-\nnitudes by between \u2206Kroncal + \u2206Kron = 0.1 and 0.17 and the\nextrapolated magnitudes being systematically too bright by\n\u2212\u2206extrap.cal \u2212 \u2206Kron = 0.05 to 0.11 magnitudes.

The Schechter function fit is constrained mainly\naround M\u22c6 and in this case the \u03c7\n2 value indicates it is not\na good fit overall.\nThe residual differences between the Kron and extrapo-\nlated magnitude luminosity functions arise from the scatter\nin the relation between extrapolated and Kron magnitudes.\nIf this scatter is dominated by measurement error, then these\ndifferences represent small biases, which are largest for the\nless robust, extrapolated magnitudes. However, it is possi-\nble that the scatter is due to genuine variations in galaxy\nmorphology and light profiles. To assess which of these al-\nternatives is correct requires independent deep photome-\ntry of a sample of 2MASS galaxies to quantify the accu-\nracy of the extrapolated magnitudes. However, we note that\nthe V\/Vmax distributions for the extrapolated magnitudes\nshown in Fig. 7 have mean \u3008V\/Vmax\u3009 values significantly\ngreater than 0.5, which is probably an indication that the\nextrapolated magnitudes are not robust. Thus, overall we\nfavour adopting Kron magnitudes, noting the small offset of\n\u2206Kroncal + \u2206Kron \u2212 \u2206conv = 0.08 to 0.15 required to convert\nto total magnitudes and correct for the convolving effect of\nmeasurement errors.\nThe parameters of the STY Schechter function fits\nshown in Fig. 13 are listed in the first row of Table 1.\nThe subsequent rows illustrate how the best-fit parameters\nchange when the cosmological model is varied and the evo-\nlutionary correction is included or excluded. The M\u22c6 values\nare approximately 0.14 magnitudes fainter for the \u21260 = 1\ncase than for our standard \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology.\nThis shift is largely due to the difference in distance mod-\nuli between the two cosmologies at the median redshift of\nthe survey. This, and the difference in the volume-redshift\nrelation, cause \u03c6\u22c6 to change in order to preserve the same\ngalaxy number counts.\nFig. 15 compares our estimates of the KS-band luminos-\nity function for our standard \u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology,\nwith the estimates of Mobasher et al. (1993), Glazebrook et\nal. (1995), Gardner et al. (1997), Szokoly et al. (1998), Love-\nday (2000) and Kochanek et al. (2001). In general, these au-\nthors assumed different cosmological models when analysing\ntheir data. We have therefore modified the estimates from\neach survey. First, we apply a shift in magnitude reflecting\nthe difference in distance moduli, at the median redshift,\nbetween the assumed cosmological model and our standard\n\u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 model. We then apply a shift in number\ndensity so as to keep fixed the surface density of galaxies\nper square degree at the survey magnitude limit. In the case\nof the Kochanek et al. (2001) luminosity function we have\nshifted the data points brightwards by 0.05 magnitudes to\naccount for the mean difference between the 2MASS isopho-\ntal magnitudes used by Kochanek et al. (2001) and the Kron\nmagnitudes we have adopted. Schechter function parameters\nscaled and adjusted in this manner are given for each sur-\nvey in Table 3. Note that due to the correlations between\nthe Schechter function parameters it is better to judge the\nagreement between the different estimates by reference to\nFig. 15 rather than by the parameter values in Table 3. Our\nnew estimate of the KS-band luminosity function is in excel-\nlent agreement with the independent estimates and has the\nsmallest statistical errors at all magnitudes brighter than\nMKS \u2212 5 log h = \u221222. For very faint magnitudes, from \u221220\nto \u221216, the sparsely sampled survey of Loveday (2000) has\nsmaller statistical errors. Note that many previous analyses\nof the K-band luminosity function ignored the contribution\nof large scale structure to the error in \u03a6\u22c6, and so the errors\nin Table 3 are likely to be underestimated.\nAlso shown on the lower panel of Fig. 15 is an esti-\nmate of the K-band luminosity function inferred from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) near infrared, z\u2217-band lu-\nminosity function of Blanton et al. (2001). To convert from\nz\u2217 (AB system) to standard K we have simply subtracted\n2.12 magnitudes from the SDSS z\u2217 magnitudes. This off-\nset consists of a contribution of 0.51 magnitudes to convert\nfrom AB magnitudes to the standard Vega system, and a\nmean z\u2217-KS colour of 1.61, which we find is typical of the\nmodel spectra discussed in Section 3 that match our ob-\nserved bJ-KS colours. As has been noted by Wright (2001)\nthe luminosity function inferred from the SDSS data is off-\nset compared to our estimate. One suggestion put forward\nby Wright (2001) is that the 2MASS magnitudes could be\nsystematically too faint. The systematic error would have\nto amount to 0.5 magnitudes to reconcile the luminosity\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 15\nFigure 15.

Such an error is\ncomprehensively excluded by the very small offset that was\nfound in Section 2.3 between the 2MASS Kron magnitudes\nand the data of Loveday (2000).

Finally, we note that a good match to our esti-\nmate of the KS-band luminosity function cannot be achieved\nby simply moving the SDDS curve in Fig. 15 horizontally.\nIf slid by 0.5 magnitudes to match the luminosity density\nthen it falls well below our estimate at bright magnitudes.\nHowever if the SDSS curve is moved vertically, by a factor of\n1.6, then the two estimates come into reasonable agreement\nat all magnitudes. Thus, the most likely explanation of the\ndifference between the SDSS and 2MASS-2dFGRS luminos-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nNear IR Luminosity Functions 17\nity functions is the uncertainty in the overall normalization\ninduced by large-scale density fluctuations. It is to be hoped\nthat as the sky coverage of the SDSS and 2MASS-2dFGRS\nsurveys increases this discrepancy will be reduced.\n5.2 Colour Distributions\nSince our combined 2MASS\u20132dFGRS catalogue includes bJ-\nband and infrared magnitudes, it is also possible to es-\ntimate the bJ-band optical luminosity function and the\noptical\/infrared bivariate luminosity function. We do not\npresent the bJ-band optical luminosity function here as esti-\nmates from the 2dFGRS are discussed in detail in Norberg\net al. (2001) and decomposed into luminosity functions of\ndifferent spectral types in Folkes et al. (1999) and Madg-\nwick et al. (2001). Instead, we present the bivariate bJ\/KS\nand J\/KS luminosity functions in Fig. 16, in the form of\nthe rest-frame bJ\u2212KS and J\u2212KS colour distributions, split\nby KS-band absolute magnitude. Results are shown for just\nour default set of k+e corrections, but the colour distribu-\ntions are extremely insensitive to this choice and to whether\nevolutionary corrections are ignored or included. The shape\nof bJ\u2212KS colour distribution varies systematically with KS-\nband luminosity. At fainter magnitudes there is an increas-\ningly large population of bluer, star-forming galaxies. The\nstar formation rate has less effect on the infrared J\u2212KS\ncolours. Here, the shape of the J\u2212KS colour distribution\nvaries little with luminosity, but the position of the peak\nmoves gradually redder with increasing luminosity. Colour\ndistributions such as these are sensitive to both the distribu-\ntion of stellar age and the metallicity, and therefore provide\nimportant constraints on models of galaxy formation (for\nexample, see Cole et al. 2000).\n5.3 Spectral Type Distribution\nAnother interesting issue that we can address with our data\nis the distribution of spectral types in the 2MASS catalogue.\nFor this, we make use of the spectral information in the 2dF\ngalaxies extracted by a principal component analysis (Folkes\net al. 1999). Specifically, we use the new continuous variable\nintroduced in Madgwick, Lahav & Taylor (2001) which is\ndefined by a linear combination of the first 2 principal com-\nponent projections, \u03b7 \u2261 0.44pc1 \u2212 pc2. This variable was\nchosen to be robust to instrumental uncertainties whilst, at\nthe same time, preserving physical information about the\ngalaxy. The dominant influence on the \u03b7 parameter is the\nrelative strength of absorption and emission lines (\u03b7<0 im-\nplies less than average emission-line strength while \u03b7>0 im-\nplies stronger than average emission-line strength). A more\ndetailed description will be presented in Madgwick et al. (in\npreparation).\nWe can now gain insight into the population mix of our\n2MASS sample by simply creating a histogram of the \u03b7 val-\nues for the corresponding 2MASS\u20132dFGRS matched galax-\nies with J<14.45 (Kron). We plot this in Fig. 17 where we\nalso show data for the entire 2dFGRS sample as comparison.\nAlso shown in Fig. 17 (bottom panel) is the morphology-\u03b7\nrelation derived from a sample of galaxy spectra from the\nKennicutt Atlas (Kennicutt 1992).\nIt can be clearly seen from Fig. 17 that the predominant\nFigure 17. The distribution of the spectral type parameter, \u03b7,\nin the full 2dFGRS and our matched 2MASS catalogue (upper\npanel). The lower panel uses a sample of galaxies from Kennicutt\n(1992) to show how \u03b7 is correlated with morphological type.\npopulation in the 2MASS sample is has \u03b7<\u22122. By contrast-\ning this with values of \u03b7 obtained from the spectra of galax-\nies with known morphological type (Kennicutt 1992), we can\nsee that this corresponds to galaxies of E\/S0 morphologies.\nMore precisely, the fraction of galaxies in our matched sam-\nple with spectral types corresponding to E\/S0 morphologies\nis 62% (compared with \u223c 35% in the full 2dFGRS). Sa-Sb\ngalaxies make up a further 22% and the remaining 16% are\ngalaxies of later morphological types.\n5.4 The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function\nIn contrast to optical light, near-infrared luminosities are\nrelatively insensitive to the presence of young stars and can\nbe more accurately related to the underlying stellar mass.\nThus, with relatively few model assumptions, we can de-\nrive the distribution of galaxy stellar masses. The integral\nof this distribution is the total mass density in stars, which\ncan be expressed in units of the critical density as \u2126stars. At-\ntempts to estimate this quantity date back many decades,\nbut even recent estimates such as those by Persic & Salucci\n(1992), Gnedin & Ostriker (1992), Fukugita, Hogan & Pee-\nbles (1996) and Salucci & Persic (1999) have very large un-\ncertainties because they are based on B-band light and re-\nquire uncertain B-band mass-to-light ratios. The much more\naccurate estimate that we provide here should prove very\nuseful for a variety of purposes.\nTo estimate the galaxy stellar mass function, we use the\nmodelling of the stellar populations described in Section 3 to\nobtain estimates of the present luminosity and stellar mass-\nto-light ratio for each galaxy in the survey. This is done on a\ngalaxy-by-galaxy basis as described in Section 3. The sample\nwe analyze is defined by the 11<J<14.45 (Kron) apparent\nmagnitude limits. The stellar mass that we estimate for each\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n18 S. Cole et al.\nFigure 18. SWML estimates of the stellar mass function (open symbols with error bars) and STY Schechter function estimates (lines).\nThe parameter and error estimates of the Schechter function fits are given in the legends. The left-hand panel is for a Kennicutt IMF\nwith recycled fraction R = 0.42 and the right-hand panel for a Salpeter IMF with R = 0.28.\ngalaxy is the mass locked up in stars and stellar remnants.\nThis differs from the time integral of the star formation rate\nbecause some of the material that goes into forming massive\nstars is returned to the interstellar medium via winds and\nsupernovae. For a given IMF, this recycled fraction, R, can\nbe estimated reasonably accurately from stellar evolution\ntheory. Here, we adopt the values R = 0.42 and 0.28 for the\nKennicutt (1983) and Salpeter (1955) IMFs respectively, as\ndescribed in Section 5.2 of Cole et al. (2000) who made use of\nthe models of Renzini & Voli (1981) and Woosley & Weaver\n(1995). Hence, the stellar masses we choose to estimate are\n(1\u2212R) times the time integral of the star formation rate to\nthe present day. Note that the IMFs we consider assume that\nonly stars with mass greater than 0.1M\u2299 ever form and so\nwe are not accounting for any mass that may be locked up\nin the form of brown dwarfs.\nOur results are presented in Fig. 18 which shows both\nSWML and Schechter function estimates of the present-\nday galaxy stellar mass function for two choices of IMF.\nThe SWML estimates are tabulated in Table 4. Just as for\nthe luminosity functions, the stellar mass function is quite\nwell described by the Schechter functional form. Integrat-\ning over these Schechter functions to determine the total\nstellar mass gives \u2126starsh = (1.4 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 for the\nKennicutt IMF and \u2126starsh = (2.6 \u00b1 0.39) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 for the\nSalpeter IMF. Note that the integral converges rapidly at\nboth limits and, in particular, the contribution to \u2126stars\nfrom objects with Mstars < 10\n9 h\u22122 M\u2299 is negligible. We\nfind that these values vary by less than the quoted errors\nwhen we alter the assumed (k+e)-corrections by either ig-\nnoring evolution, ignoring dust or changing \u21260.

Observational estimates of the star formation history\nof the universe. The points with error bars show estimates of the\nmean star formation rate per unit volume at various redshifts\n(see Steidel et al. 1999 and references therein). The solid sym-\nbols are the star formation rates implied if there is no absorption\nby dust. The open symbols show estimates corrected for dust\nabsorption using a Calzetti (1999) extinction law with a mean\nE(B\u2212 V) = 0.15 (Steidel et al. 1999). In both cases an \u21260 = 0.3,\n\u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology has been used to calculate the volume as a\nfunction of redshift and a Salpeter IMF to convert luminosity to\nstar formation rate. The smooth curves are the fits we use when\nintegrating over time to estimate the total mass density of stars\nformed by the present.\ntion we estimated in Section 2.3 to transform 2MASS Kron\ninto total magnitudes, then these estimates and their un-\ncertainties increase to \u2126starsh = (1.6 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 for the\nKennicutt IMF and \u2126starsh = (2.9 \u00b1 0.43) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 for the\nSalpeter IMF. Both of these estimates are consistent with\nthe value, \u2126stars = (3.0\u00b1 1.0)\u00d7 10\n\u22123 , derived by Salucci &\nPersic (1999) but have fractional statistical errors which are\nseveral times smaller. With our method, the uncertainty in\n\u2126stars is clearly dominated by the uncertainty in the IMF.\nFor some purposes, it is not possible to improve upon this\nwithout a more precise knowledge of the true IMF \u2013 assum-\ning there is a universal IMF. However, for other applications,\nsuch as modelling the star formation history of the universe,\nit is necessary to assume a specific IMF to convert the ob-\nservational tracers of star formation to star formation rates.\nHence, in this case, it is the much smaller statistical errors\nthat are relevant.\nIt is interesting to compare our values with what\nis inferred by integrating the observational estimates of\nthe mean star formation history of the universe. Fig. 19\nshows observational estimates for one particular choice\nof cosmology and IMF and illustrates how the rates are\nsensitive to the assumed dust extinction. By fitting a\nsmooth curve through these estimates, we can calculate\nthe mass of stars formed by the present day and how\nthis depends on the IMF and assumed dust extinction.\nThe upper smooth curve shown in Fig. 19 is of the\nform \u03c1\u02d9\u22c6 = (a + bz)\/(1 + (z\/c)\nd)hM\u2299yr\n\u22121Mpc\u22123, where\n(a, b, c, d) = (0.0166, 0.1848, 1.9474, 2.6316).

As for our estimates above, we\nassume that no mass goes into forming brown dwarfs and\nmultiply the star formation rate by 1\u2212R, where R is the\nrecycled fraction, so as to form an estimate of the mass\nlocked up in stars. Values of \u2126starsh\n2 estimated in this way\nare listed in Table 5. The values in this table are for an\n\u21260 = 0.3, \u039b0 = 0.7 cosmology, but they are insensitive to\nthis choice. They depend slightly on the assumed metallic-\nity of the stellar population and would be 10% lower if half\nsolar, rather than solar metallicity were assumed. Note that\nthe \u2126stars values inferred from the star formation history\nof the universe scale differently with the assumed Hubble\nconstant than those inferred above from the IR luminosity\nfunctions. For h = 0.7 our estimates from 2MASS become\n\u2126starsh\n2 = (1.12 \u00b1 0.16) \u00d7 10\u22123 for the Kennicutt IMF and\n\u2126starsh\n2 = (2.03\u00b1 0.30)\u00d7 10\u22123 for the Salpeter IMF. Com-\nparison with Table 5 shows that these values are consistent\nwith those inferred from the cosmic star formation history\nonly if the dust correction assumed in the latter is mod-\nest, E(B-V)\u2248 0.1. This value is 50% smaller than the value\npreferred by Steidel et al. (1999).\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThe new generation of very large surveys currently underway\nmake it possible to characterize the galaxy population with\nunprecedented accuracy. In this paper, we have combined\ntwo such large surveys, the infrared imaging 2MASS and the\n2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey\u2020 to obtain a complete dataset\nwhich is more than an order of magnitude larger than previ-\nous datasets used for statistical studies of the near-infrared\nproperties of the local galaxy population. We have used this\ncombined catalogue to derive the most precise estimates to\ndate of the galaxy J and KS-band luminosity functions and\nof the galaxy stellar mass function.\nCharacterizing the near-infrared properties of galax-\nies offers several advantages. Firstly, the near-infrared light\nis dominated by established, old stellar populations rather\nthan by the recent star formation activity that dominates\nthe blue light. Thus, the J and K-band luminosity functions\nreflect the integrated star formation history of a galaxy and,\n\u2020 A table containing the positions, 2MASS infra-red magni-\ntudes and 2dFGRS redshifts used in this paper and elec-\ntronic versions of Tables 2 and 4 are available at http:\/\/star-\nwww.dur.ac.uk\/\u02dccole\/2dFGRS-2MASS .\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n20 S. Cole et al.\nas a result, provide particularly important diagnostics of the\nprocesses of galaxy formation. For the same reason, the dis-\ntribution of stellar mass in galaxies \u2013the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction\u2013 can be derived from the near-infrared luminosities\nin a relatively straightforward way, with only a weak model\ndependence. Finally, corrections for dust extinction as well\nas k-corrections are much smaller in the near-infrared than\nin the optical.\nDue to the size of our sample, our determination of\nthe J- and KS-band galaxy luminosity functions have, for\nthe most part, smaller statistical errors than previous esti-\nmates. Furthermore, since our sample is infrared-selected,\nour estimates are free from any potential biases that might\naffect infrared luminosity functions derived from optically-\nselected samples. We find that the J- and KS-band galaxy\nluminosity functions are fairly well described by Schechter\nfunctions, although there is some evidence for an excess of\nbright galaxies relative to the best-fit Schechter functional\nform. In general, the SWML estimates are a truer represen-\ntation of the luminosity functions. Our K-band estimates are\nin overall agreement with most previous determinations, but\nhave smaller statistical errors.\nThe exception is the K-band luminosity function in-\nferred from the near infrared SDDS photometry (Blanton\net al. 2001). The difference between the K-band luminosity\nfunction we infer from their data and our own estimate is\ntoo large to be explained by photometric differences. The\ndifference between the two estimates is better described by\na difference in overall number density of a factor of 1.6.\nA similar discrepancy is seen in the bJ-band between the\nSDSS and 2dFGRS luminosity function estimates (see Nor-\nberg et al. 2001 and Blanton et al. 2001). The suspicion is\nthat the uncertainty in the overall normalization of the lumi-\nnosity functions induced by large-scale structure within the\nlarge, but finite, survey volumes could be to blame. However,\nthe errors that we quote for the 2dFGRS-2MASS luminosity\nfunctions already include an estimate of this sampling un-\ncertainty as derived from realistic mock catalogues. A sim-\nilar exercise for a catalogue with the same area and depth\nas that of Blanton et al. (2001) indicates that the required\noverdensity of a factor of 1.6 is unlikely. So probably there\nis more than one contributory factor at work and the hope\nis that these will be identified as the surveys progress.\nUsing our J-band luminosity function, bJ\u2212KS and\nJ\u2212KS colours and simple galaxy evolutionary tracks, we\nhave obtained the first estimate of the galactic stellar mass\nfunction derived directly from near-infrared data. We find\nthat this mass function is also fairly well described by a\nSchechter form. An integral over the stellar mass function\ngives \u2126stars, the universal mass density locked up in lumi-\nnous stars and stellar remnants, expressed in terms of the\ncritical density. \u2126stars is a key component of the overall in-\nventory of baryons in the universe. An accurate determi-\nnation of this quantity is essential for detailed comparisons\nwith other quantities of cosmological interest such as the\ntotal baryonic mass, \u2126baryon, inferred from Big Bang nucle-\nosynthesis considerations (e.g. Burles & Tytler 1998), the\ncosmic star formation rate (e.g. Steidel et al. 1999), and the\ncosmic evolution of the gas content of the universe (Storrie-\nLombardi & Wolfe 2000). The statistical uncertainty in\nour estimate of \u2126stars is about 15%, several times smaller\nthan the best previous determination by Salucci & Persic\n(1999). In fact, the errors in \u2126stars are dominated by sys-\ntematic uncertainties associated with the choice of stellar\nIMF in the galaxy evolution model. A Kennicutt IMF gives\n\u2126starsh = (1.6 \u00b1 0.24) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 while a Salpeter IMF gives\n\u2126starsh = (2.9\u00b1 0.43)\u00d7 10\n\u22123. For h = 0.7, these values cor-\nrespond to less than 11% of the baryonic mass inferred from\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (Burles et al. 1999). Our values of\n\u2126stars today are only consistent with recent determinations\nof the integrated cosmic star formation if the correction for\ndust extinction is modest.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank John Lucey for the initial suggestion to look at\nthe 2MASS database.
