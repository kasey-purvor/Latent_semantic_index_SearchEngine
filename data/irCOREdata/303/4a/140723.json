This \n 2\nobservation is consistent with previous reports that phenolic compounds in strawberry \nfruit are inhibitory to B. cinerea.  \n \nKeywords: Botrytis cinerea, grey mould, natural disease resistance, phytoanticipin, \nthin layer chromatography bioassay \n \n1.  Introduction \n \nStrawberry fruit (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) vary in their inherent \nsusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea Pers. (Teleomorph: Botryotinia fuckeliana (de Bary) \nWhetzel) according to their physiological status (Gilles, 1959) and genotype \n(Daugaard et al., 1999; H\u00e9bert et al., 2002).  However, no strawberry cultivar is \nhighly resistant to grey mould.  B. cinerea tends to infect inflorescences in the field, \nbut extensive fruit decay is only usually seen following harvest after when the fruit \nhas reached and passed full harvest maturity (Powelson, 1960; Bristow et al., 1986).  \nTherefore, B. cinerea generally remains quiescent until either physiochemical \ndefences and\/or stimulation in the host fall or rise, respectively, to allow invasion to \ncontinue.  The inherent natural disease resistance (NDR) of strawberry fruit probably \ndeclines during fruit development and senescence, including during postharvest \nstorage.  Between flowering and fruit senescence there is evidently a period of \nrelatively high resistance when grey mould development is rare. \nAuthors have attributed variation in NDR in strawberry fruit to skin strength \n(Gooding, 1976), fruit tissue firmness (Barritt, 1980) and flower susceptibility \n(Bristow et al., 1986).  As with many other fruit patho-systems, the lack of nutritional \nrequirements for the pathogen, activation of fungal pathogenicity factors and the \npresence\/decline of preformed or induced antifungal compounds during fruit \ndevelopment (Prusky, 1996) may also influence NDR in strawberry fruit.  However, \nrelatively little work has been undertaken to characterise and identify preformed \n(phytoanticipin) and\/or induced (phytoalexin) compounds with activity against \npathogens (Table 1) or pests (Luczynski et al., 1990) of strawberry.  With a view to \nbetter characterising NDR in strawberry fruit, experiments were performed to \nelucidate NDR in strawberry flowers and fruit.  These involved determining the \npresence and partial identity of constitutive antifungal compounds during \n 3\ndevelopment.  The presence of antifungals in different parts of the strawberry flower \nand fruit was also investigated.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 \n \n2. Materials and methods \n \n2.1. Plant material \n \nCold-stored maiden-year A+ grade strawberry cv. Elsanta plants were supplied \nby KG Fruits Ltd. (Kent, UK).  The plants were grown in a glasshouse according to \nTerry and Joyce, 2000 in 1 litre capacity pots containing peat and expanded \npolystyrene (10 + 1 parts by volume).  Temperatures ranged from 20 to 40\u00b0C during \nthe day and 5 to 20\u00b0C during the night in spring (March-May) 2000. \n \n2.2. Inoculum preparation \n \nSingle-spored isolates of the pathogen, B. cinerea, and the bioassay organism, \nCladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries, were recovered from naturally \ninfected strawberry cv. Elsanta fruit (Terry et al., 2003).  They were cultured in 9 cm \ndiameter Petri plates on \u00bd strength PDA (potato dextrose agar; 19.5 g l-1 distilled \nwater) (Oxoid Ltd., Berkshire, UK) at 22 \u00b11 and 20 \u00b11\u00b0C, respectively.  Streptomycin \n(1.0 mg ml-1) was added to the \u00bd PDA to inhibit potential growth of bacteria.  The \ncultures were subjected to diurnal (12 h d-1) UV-A lighting to induce sporulation.  \n \n2.3. Fruit sampling, inoculation and disease assessment \n \nTwenty-two fruit each of green stage I (7 days after anthesis; DAA), white (21 \nDAA) and red (28 DAA) stages of maturity (Culpepper et al., 1935) with no signs of \nfungal infection were harvested at random.  DAA was monitored following the \ntagging of flowers at anthesis.  Fruit were wound inoculated by application of a 15 \u00b5l \ndrop of a 4 day-old B. cinerea conidial suspension (2 x 104 conidia ml-1) to the fruit \nshoulder (Adikaram et al., 2002).  Non-inoculated fruit were used as controls.  Fruit \n 4\nwere held in the dark at 5\u00b0C and 95 to 100% relative humidity (RH) in individual \nclosed but vented polystyrene containers in a completely randomised design  (Terry \nand Joyce, 2000).  Disease severity resulting from inoculation or natural infection was \nassessed as the percentage area of each fruit covered by grey mould, and was recorded \ndaily.  10% disease severity was defined as the first instance disease was visible on \nsurface of fruit. \n \n2.4. Thin layer chromatography \n \nGlass-backed TLC plates (20 x 10 or 20 x 20 cm) coated with silica gel 60 or \nsilica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used.  The plates were spotted \nusing a 5 or 10 \u00b5l micro-pipette with 5-100 \u00b5l of resuspended crude or sequentially \nextracted strawberry fruit and flower extracts made at 0.2 ml g-1 fresh weight (FW) \n(Droby et al., 1986).  The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (0.5 mg ml-1) and \nextracting solvents (99% v\/v) were used as positive and negative controls, \nrespectively.  TLC plates were developed in either one or two dimensions  (1-D, 2-D) \nat approximately 22\u00b0C in a TLC tank (20 x 20 x 10 cm) lined with filter paper to \ncreate a solvent saturated atmosphere.  1-D TLCs were developed either in 100 ml of \nrunning solvents comprised of hexane: ethyl acetate: methanol (A = 60:40:1; B = \n60:40:10; C = 60:40:20; D = 60:40:30 v\/v\/v) (Terry et al., 2003) or in the organic \nphase of ethyl acetate: benzene: ethanol (4:1:1, v\/v\/v; Mussell and Staples, 1971).  2-\nD TLCs (Wedge and Nagle, 2000) were developed in solvent system A (1-D) and \nthen solvent system D (2-D).  Developed 1-D and 2-D chromatograms were air-dried \nand then either used for antifungal bioassays or sprayed with chemical reagents. \n \n2.5. TLC bioassay \n \nDeveloped chromatograms were sprayed with spore suspensions of either C. \ncladosporioides (2 x 107 spores ml-1) or B. cinerea (2 x 106 conidia ml-1) in Czapek \nDox nutrient solution, respectively (Zainuri et al., 2001; Adikaram et al., 2002).  \nPlates were incubated at 100% RH and 20\u00b0C for 3 to 6 days.  Zones of fungal \ninhibition, where mycelial growth was absent, indicated the presence of antifungal \nactivity (Klarman and Stanford 1968).  Weak antifungal activity was defined as areas \n 5\nwith less dense lighter coloured mycelium from positive control (extracting solvent \nonly). The retention factor (Rf) and areas of inhibition were measured and recorded. \n \n2.6. Antifungal identification \n \nDetection procedures for compounds on 1 and 2-D TLCs included inspection \nunder visible and ultraviolet (254 and 336 nm) light before and during fuming with \n98% v\/v ammonia.  After examination, ammonia was removed from plates by air \ndrying for 1h.  Replicate plates were sprayed with 10% w\/v phosphomolybdic acid \n(PMA) in ethanol, and heated to about 100\u00b0C for 2 min (Terry et al., 2003).  PMA is a \ngeneral visualisation reagent for oxidizable compounds.  More chemical class specific \nvisualisation reagents were used for detection of phenolics (Folin-Ciocalteu; \ndiazotized sulfanilic acid), alkaloids (Dragendorff\u2019s) (Waterman and Mole, 1994; \nTerry et al., 2003) and terpenes (Ehlrich\u2019s; Vincent et al., 1999).   The Rf and colour \nof detected spots were recorded and compared to zones of fungal inhibition on \nduplicate bioassay chromatograms.  \n \n2.7. Crude extraction of whole strawberry fruit at different development stages \nWhole green I, white and red stage strawberry fruit without calyxes (50 g FW) \nwere randomly harvested, immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -\n18\u00b0C until use.  Each sample extract was prepared according to Terry et al. (2003).  \nBriefly, fruit was ground in liquid nitrogen and added into 99% (v\/v) ethanol at 3 ml \ng-1 FW.  The mixture was homogenised, filtered, and then concentrated in a rotary \nevaporator (Buchi Rotovapor, B\u00fcchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) under \nvacuum of 0.6 kPa at 40\u00b0C to approximately one third of the original volume.  The \nconcentrated extract was then partitioned twice with equal volumes of 99% (v\/v) \ndichloromethane using a separating funnel.  The lower dichloromethane layers were \npooled and dried by adding 6 g of anhydrous MgSO4.  This mixture was then filtered, \nevaporated to dryness and resuspended in 99% (v\/v) ethanol at 0.2 ml g-1 FW (Droby \net al., 1986).  The experiment was repeated twice to reduce possible variations in fruit \nchemistry. \n \n 6\n2.8. Crude extraction of different tissues from whole strawberry fruit at different \ndevelopment stages \nGreen stage I, white and red strawberry fruit were harvested and dissected into \npith, corticular parenchyma, epidermal tissue without achenes and achenes.  Each \ntissue type (10 g FW) from each fruit stage and whole fruit were extracted as \ndescribed above for whole fruit.  The experiment was repeated twice. \n \n2.9. Sequential extraction and column chromatography of green stage I tissues  \n \nGreen stage I achenes (35 g FW; 10.12 g DW), whole fruit without achenes \n(75 g FW; 8.12 g DW) and whole fruit with achenes (125 g FW; 15.92 g DW) were \nsequentially extracted with solvents of increasing polarity at 3 ml g-1 FW (hexane, \nethyl acetate and ethanol (99% v\/v)).  1-D TLCs run in solvent system B were \nperformed on each extract (0.2 ml g-1 FW).  On the basis of similar\/identical patterns \non the TLC plate to treatment with PMA reagent, hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of \nachenes (50; 119 mg extract DW) and whole fruit with achenes (74; 83 mg extract \nDW) were each combined to increase the amount of material in preparation for \npurification.  . \nHexane and ethyl acetate dry extracts were each chromatographed in a glass \ncolumn of 7.5 cm length and 2 cm diameter packed with Silica gel 60 (Fluka, St. \nLouis, USA) using three solvent combinations of increasing polarity.  The extracts \nwere first dissolved in the minimum volume of hexane: ethyl acetate (80: 20 v\/v) and \nthen layered on top of the column pre-equilibrated with the same solvent.  One \nthousand drop fractions of the column eluate were collected using a Pharmain LKB-\nRedifrac (Amersham BioSciences, Bucks., UK).  The sequential solvent systems used \nfor elution (40 ml) were hexane: ethyl acetate (60: 40 v\/v), hexane: ethyl acetate: \nmethanol 40:60:1 (v\/v\/v) and (20: 80: 1; v\/v\/v).  Eighteen and 43 fractions were \nobtained from hexane and ethyl acetate combined extracts, respectively.  These \nfractions were reduced to 3 and 7 fractions, respectively, by pooling on the basis of \nsimilar TLC behaviour to PMA run in solvent B.  1D-TLC bioassays were performed \non pooled fractions run in solvent B.  \n \n2.10. Sequential extraction of green stage I achenes \n \n 7\nGreen stage I fruit were randomly harvested and their achenes removed.  \nAchenes (10 g FW; 2.89 g DW) were prepared and sequentially extracted in ethyl \nacetate and ethanol as described above and then used for TLC bioassays. \n \n2.11. Sequential extraction of different strawberry flower development stages \n \nStrawberry flowers at white bud, full bloom and post-anthesis development \nstages (Jarvis and Borecka, 1968) were randomly harvested and prepared  as \npreviously described for fruit.  Besides whole flowers, receptacle tissue including \npistils from each of the 3 flower stages were also selected and prepared as described \nabove.  Each sample (10 g FW) was sequentially extracted in ethyl acetate and ethanol \n(99% v\/v) as previously described and the extracts were used for TLC bioassays. \n \n2.12. Data analysis and presentation \n \nDisease severity data were analysed by using ANOVA using Genstat 5 \nVersion 4.1.  Where significant differences among treatments were obtained, mean \nseparation was by LSD (P = 0.05). \n \n3. Results  \n \n3.1. Disease severity \n \nDisease expression studies at 5\u00b0C suggested that the natural disease resistance \nof strawberry cv. Elsanta fruit declined during fruit development (Table 2).  The time \nto 10% disease severity for green stage I fruit was significantly (P < 0.001) longer \nthan for white and red stages.  Control and inoculated green stage I fruit were \napproximately 1.5  and 3 times more resistant in terms of time to 10% disease severity \nto grey mould after harvest than red fruit.  In contrast to white and red stage fruit, B. \ncinerea conidia were never produced on green stage I fruit.  Rather a mass of white \nmycelium was observed.  Thus, normal development of the fungus was also inhibited \non green stage I fruit.  Natural infection was always caused by B. cinerea.  Time to \n10% disease severity was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) for inoculated fruit than \n 8\ncontrol fruit.  There was no significant (P > 0.05) interaction between fruit stage and \ninoculation.  Thus, fruit development stage effects were similar for both \u00b1 inoculation \ntreatments.  No difference was observed in the morphology of grey mould infections \nbetween inoculated and control fruit of the same development stage.   \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 \n \n3.2. Preformed antifungals in strawberry fruit tissue extracts of different \ndevelopmental stages \n \nCrude ethanol extracts of green stage I, white and red stage strawberry cv. \nElsanta fruit contain varying degrees of antifungal activity as shown by 1-D TLC \nbioassay (Plate 1).  Green stage I fruit extracts contained at least two colourless \npreformed antifungal compounds (Rf 0.44 and 0.37) that were not present in white and \nred stage fruit (Table 3).  Negative TLC plate reactions to UV-C, phenolic and \nDragendorff\u2019s reagent sprays suggest that these compounds were neither phenolics \nnor alkaloids, respectively (data not shown).  Low intensity to but positive reactions \nof Rf 0.37 to Ehrlich\u2019s reagent suggested that it may be a terpene.   \n \nINSERT PLATE 1 \nINSERT TABLE 3 \n \nCrude extracts of white and red fruit contained a yellow-coloured non-polar \npreformed antifungal compound (Rf 0.86) of weak intensity that was not found in \ngreen stage I fruit (Table 3). All fruit maturity stages showed antifungal activity at the \norigin of TLC bioassay (Plate 1).  The approximate area of fungal inhibition at the \norigin in green stage I fruit extracts (Rf 0.13-0.00) was 1.87 and 1.73-fold greater than \nin white and red fruit extracts, respectively (Plate 1; Table 3). Positive reactions to \nUV-C (dark), Folin Ciocalteu (dark blue) and sulfanilic acid (brown) reagent sprays \nsuggest that origin compound(s) contain phenolics with antifungal properties against \nC. cladosporioides and B. cinerea (data not shown).  \n \n3.3. Distribution of preformed antifungals in green stage I fruit tissue \n 9\n \nTLC bioassays of extracts from various green stage I fruit tissues revealed that \ngreatest antifungal activity was in the achenes (Table 4).  None-the-less, antifungal \nactivity was found in all tissue types; the pith, cortex and epidermis of green stage I \nfruit.  The total area of fungal inhibition for green stage I achenes crude extracts was \nat least 1.4-fold greater than for other tissue types.  All tissues showed similar \nantifungal profiles to those seen in whole green I fruit crude extracts (Plate 1 and \nTable 3).  \n \nINSERT TABLE 4 \n \nB. cinerea and C. cladosporioides were both inhibited by antifungal \ncompounds separated in all running solvent systems (data not shown).  Fungal growth \ninhibition by extracts from green stage I fruit achenes was evident for 20, 10 and 5 \u00b5l \naliquots of crude extract (data not shown).  The water content of achenes is almost \none third that of other green stage I strawberry fruit tissue.  However, on a dry weight \nbasis achenes contained more antifungal compounds compared to whole fruit, pith, \ncortex and epidermis.  1 and 2-D C. cladosporioides TLC bioassays revealed that \ngreen stage I fruit achenes may contain at least eight preformed antifungal compounds \n(Table 5; data not shown) with two compounds at Rf 0.42 and 0.36 (Table 5) \napparently corresponding to Rfs at 0.44 and 0.37 in whole green stage I extracts (Plate \n1 and Table 3).  Antifungal activity was observed at origin on TLC plates for white \nand red stage achene tissue (Table 5). However, when run in an organic phase of ethyl \nacetate: benzene: 50% (v\/v) ethanol (4:1:1) (Mussell and Staples, 1971), antifungal \nactivity against B. cinerea was observed at Rf 0.76-0.58 for green stage I achenes \n(Table 6).   \n   \nINSERT TABLE 5 \nINSERT TABLE 6 \n \nGreen stage I fruit achenes sequentially extracted in ethyl acetate or ethanol \ndisplayed very different TLC behaviour to PMA reagent spray and bioassay.  \nSequential extraction and column chromatography of green stage I tissues confirmed \n 10\nthat antifungal activity was only in ethyl acetate (Table 7) and ethanol fractions.  The \nethyl acetate fraction showed similar but much less intense antifungal activity at Rfs \n0.54, 0.48, 0.28, 0.19 and 0.10 to the previous achene extract bioassays run in solvent \nB (60:40:10; v\/v\/v) (Table 7) when applied at 30 \u00b5l (0.2 ml g-1 FW).  In contrast to \nprevious TLC bioassay results with achene extracts (Table 5), strong inhibition was \nnot seen at lower applications of 10 and 20 \u00b5l aliquots.  No antifungal activity in ethyl \nacetate fraction was observed at the origin.  However, more polar phenolic \ncompounds extracted in ethanol fraction revealed antifungal activity at origin.   \n \nINSERT TABLE 7 \n \n3.4. Preformed antifungal compounds in strawberry flower tissue extracts at \ndifferent developmental stages \n \nFlower stages sequentially extracted in ethyl acetate and ethanol showed \nsimilar TLC behaviour to both PMA reagent spray and in bioassays (data not shown) \nas seen in sequentially extracted green stage I fruit achenes (Table 7 and Table 8).  \nWhole flowers at post-anthesis displayed greater antifungal activity at Rfs 0.38, 0.29, \n0.21, 0.10, 0.00 than white bud and full bloom stages (Table 8).  Whole flower ethyl \nacetate fractions had greater antifungal activity than pistils and receptacle tissue in all \nflower stages.  There was no difference in the antifungal activity (Rf 0.00) of ethanol \nfraction between whole flower stages and flower tissues (Table 8).   \n \nINSERT TABLE 8 \n \n4. Discussion \n \n4.1. Disease expression study \n \nNatural disease resistance declined during fruit development (Table 2). \nEnhanced symptom expression with increasing strawberry cv. Elsanta fruit maturity \nconfirms similar findings by Gilles (1959) and Powelson (1960) for other cultivars.  \nThe differences in time to 10% disease severity score and in the growth habit of B. \n 11\ncinerea between different fruit development stages may be due to resistance factors \nand\/or availability of nutrients (Prusky, 1996). \n \n4.2. Preformed antifungals in strawberry fruit tissue extracts of different \ndevelopmental stages \n \nAntifungal activity of strawberry cv. Elsanta crude and sequential extracts \ndeclined with increasing fruit development stage. Greater antifungal activity was \nshown in green stage I fruit (Rf 0.37, 0.44, 0.13-0.00)  as compared to white and red \nstage fruit extracts (Rf 0.00).  The antifungal zone at Rf 0.37 may correspond to one or \nmore of the three triterpene wound-induced \u2018phytoalexins\u2019, euscaphic acid, tormentic \nacid and myrianthic acid (compounds 1-3), previously identified through NMR \nspectral analysis in green stage strawberry cv. Hokowase fruit (Hirai et al., 2000).  \nHowever, it is unlikely that the observed antifungals in present study were induced as \nstrawberry fruit were not subjected to biotic stress treatment after harvest.   \nThe compounds Rf 0.44 and\/or Rf 0.37 may be similar to preformed antifungal \ncompounds found at Rf 0.66 and 0.56 (hexane: ethyl acetate; 80: 20 v\/v) in strawberry \nleaves (Vincent et al., 1999).  These compounds conferred resistance to C. fragariae, \nand were undetectable by UV or anisaldehyde spray reagent.  Anisaldehyde reacts \nwith a variety of natural chemicals, including terpenes.  TLC bioassays revealed that \nthe concentrations and presence of antifungal compounds varied between anthracnose \nresistant and susceptible cultivars (Vincent et al., 1999).  It was suggested that \nanthracnose resistance in strawberry leaves may depend upon the concentrations of \nthese preformed antifungals at Rf 0.56 and 0.66 and also a third phytoalexin-like \ncompound at Rf 0.32.  This third compound that was only induced in the resistant cv. \nSweet Charlie.   \nMussell and Staples (1971) discovered two phytoalexin-like compounds (A, Rf \n0.52; B, Rf 0.39) in strawberry roots.  These compounds were induced by challenging \ncv. Surecrop plants that were resistant to red stele disease with Phytophthora \nfragariae.  Inoculation of susceptible cv. Blakemore did not result in appearance of \nthese compounds.  However, another preformed antifungal compound (denoted C, Rf \n0.84) was found in extracts of both cultivars regardless of whether or not they were \ninoculated.  Using TLC bioassays, both phytoalexin-like compounds (A, B) and \npreformed compound C were inhibitory to Cladosporium cucumerinum.  Compounds \n 12\nA and B extracted from TLC plates and introduced into cultures of P. fragariae \nproved to be inhibitory to mycelial growth.  Compound C was not inhibitory to P. \nfragariae.  Identities of these three compounds were not determined.   \nHirai et al. (2000) proposed from TLC analysis that inducible triterpenes \nfound in green stage strawberry cv. Hokowase fruit which might confer resistance to \nColletotrichum fragariae probably correspond to the phytoalexin-like compounds A \nand B found in strawberry cv. Surecrop roots (Mussell and Staples, 1971).  In \naddition, compounds A and B were apparently not derived from phenylpropanoid \npathway as phenylalanine-ammonia lyase (PAL) activity remained constant even after \ninfection.  This observation suggests that fruit may produce similar antifungal \ncompounds to those in the roots.  In the present study, one or more of the compounds \nfound may be similar to the preformed and\/or phytoalexin-like antifungal compounds \ndiscovered in strawberry roots (Mussell and Staples, 1971), leaves (Vincent et al., \n1999) and fruit (Hirai et al., 2000).   \nTLC reagent sprays and bioassays indicate that green stage I fruit contain \nmore phenolic compounds with antifungal activity than white and red stage fruit. This \nobservation is consistent with previous research showing that a decline in phenolics \nduring strawberry fruit development (Table 1) or after harvest (Jiang et al., 2001) is \ncorrelated to decreased NDR to B. cinerea and other postharvest diseases. \nJersch et al. (1989) found no evidence that green stage strawberry cv. Senga \nSengana fruit contained preformed or inducible antifungal compounds when tested in \nagar or ELISA plate bioassays using B. cinerea or Cladosporium herbarum.  They \nsuggested that a decline in proanthocyanin (PA) concentration during fruit \ndevelopment governs B. cinerea quiescence through removing inhibition of pathogen-\nderived polygalacturonase (PG).  PA was shown in-vitro to inhibit PG produced by B. \ncinerea.  PG is one of the key enzymes involved in fungal pathogenicity (Labavitch et \nal., 1998).  Resistance of immature strawberry fruit to external infection was \ncorrelated with pronounced deposition of PA in the epidermal layer (Jersch et al., \n1989).  The overall PA content in immature fruits was negatively correlated with \nmycelial development on inoculated fruit.  PA concentration was higher in less \nsusceptible strawberry cultivars.  Harris and Dennis (1982) demonstrated that PG \nproduced by B. cinerea was rapidly inactivated by naturally occurring phenolics in \ninfected strawberry cv. Cambridge Favourite fruit.  Extracts of more resistant green \n 13\nstage strawberry fruit infected with B. cinerea showed approximately twice the endo-\nPG activity of extracts of white and red stage fruit. \nH\u00e9bert et al. (2001) and Di Venere et al. (1998) confirmed that increased \nresistance to B. cinerea was positively correlated with PA concentration.  However, \nH\u00e9bert et al. (2001; 2002), using a similar bioassay methodology to Jersch et al. \n(1989), found that aqueous extracts of immature strawberry cv. Chandler fruit did \nhave direct antifungal activity against B. cinerea conidial germination and mycelial \ngrowth.  Cultivars with higher concentrations of free and bound catechin, epicatechin \nand gallic acid were more resistant to B. cinerea.  A decline in NDR was correlated \nwith a decrease in specific proanthocyanins with antifungal activity during fruit \ndevelopment.  Thus, the phenolic compounds at the origin on TLC bioassays of \nstrawberry cv. Elsanta fruit extracts (Plate 1; Table 3) probably contain catechin, \nepicatechin and gallate.   \n \n4.3. Distribution of preformed antifungals in green stage I fruit tissue \n \nExtracts of green stage I tissues revealed that greatest antifungal activity was \nin the achenes as compared to other tissue types.  El Ghaouth et al. (1991) reported \nthat aqueous extracts of achenes from half-red cv. Chandler fruit inhibited radial \ngrowth of B. cinerea, but not Rhizopus stolonifer, in Petri plate bioassays.  However, \naqueous extracts from receptacle tissue without achenes did not inhibit the growth of \neither fungus.  Achenes appeared to contain more constitutive and potentially \nantifungal glucanohydrolase enzyme activity than did receptacle tissue.  The increased \nsusceptibility of ripe-stage strawberries to B. cinerea may be explained in part by \nreduced chitinase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase and lysozyme enzyme activities in receptacle \ntissue.  Gilles (1959) showed that sterilised strawberry juice from ripe fruit markedly \nstimulated B. cinerea conidial germination.  It is not clear how the presence of \nantifungal compounds in the achenes of different fruit development stages may \ninfluence NDR of the fruit as their release may be hindered by the achene pericarp. \n \n4.4. Preformed antifungal compounds in strawberry flower tissue extracts at \ndifferent developmental stages \n \n 14\nExtracts of whole strawberry cv. Elsanta flowers at post-anthesis showed greater \nantifungal activity than white bud and full bloom stages (Table 8).  However, the \nsusceptibility of flowers to B. cinerea increases with age to a maximum at petal-fall \n(Hennebert and Gilles, 1958).  It is possible that antifungal compounds in strawberry \nflowers may play a role in initiating B. cinerea quiescence, as B. cinerea tends to \ninfect strawberries at flowering (Powelson, 1960).  However, more research is \nrequired to establish the exact role that these compounds may have in NDR during \ninitial infection of strawberry flowers by B. cinerea. \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nStrawberry cv. Elsanta fruit and flowers contain preformed antifungal \ncompounds which differ markedly in number and activity during flower and fruit \ndevelopment. The greatest antifungal activity was found in green stage I fruit extracts, \nespecially in achenes.  These observations indicate that NDR against B. cinerea \ndepends on the initial presence and subsequent decline in preformed antifungal \ncompounds during flower and fruit development.  Full characterisation of preformed \nantifungal compounds in strawberry flower and fruit tissue and the elucidation of \npathways involved in their biosynthesis is still required.  More detailed information \nwill allow for precise definition of the role antifungal compounds play in strawberry \nfruit defence against B. cinerea, other fungal diseases, and also pests.  In turn, such \nknowledge may enable strategies to enhance the levels of these compounds in \nstrawberry (Joyce and Johnson, 1999), through environmental manipulation, genetic \ntransformation, conventional breeding and\/or preharvest treatment with elicitors\/plant \nactivators (Terry and Joyce, 2000; Adikaram et al., 2002).  In addition, an increase in \nthe concentration of these antifungal compounds, many of which are phenolics, may \nlead to increased health benefits for consumers (T\u00f6rr\u00f6nen and M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4, 2002). \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors thank The Perry Foundation (Essex, UK) and KG Fruits Ltd. for \nfinancial support and supply of planting materials, respectively.
