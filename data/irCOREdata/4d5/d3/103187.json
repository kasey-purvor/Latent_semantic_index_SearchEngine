INTRODUCTION\nBritain\u2019s anti-discrimination legislation outlaws the victimising of persons who use  that  legislation.  The  legislation,\nby way of a number of statutes, covers discrimination regarding race,  sex,  disability,  sexual  orientation,  religion  or\nbelief, age, and (for Northern Ireland) political opinion. Victimisation provides a separate course of action for  anyone\ntreated less favourably by reason that they brought a discrimination claim, or did something else  by  reference  to  the\nlegislation.\nThe appeal St Helens v Derbyshire turned on  whether  placing  public  pressure  on  equal  pay  claimants  to\ncompromise their claim amounted to victimisation. The House of Lords took this opportunity to attempt to clarify  the\nmeaning of the \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence afforded to   employers  by  the  House  in  Chief  Constable  of  West\nYorkshire Police v Khan [2001] ICR 1065 (see (2002) 31 ILJ 161). \n2. THE LEGISLATION\nVictimisation is defined in section 4, Sex Discrimination 1975:\n(1) A person (\u201cthe discriminator\u201d) discriminates  against  another  person  (\u201cthe  person  victimised\u201d)  in  any\ncircumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if  he  treats  the  person  victimised  less\nfavourably than in those circumstances he treats or would treat other persons, and does so by reason  that  the\nperson victimised has\u2014\n(a) brought proceedings against the discriminator or any other person under this  Act  or  the  Equal  Pay  Act\n1970 ... or\n(b) given evidence or information in connection with proceedings brought by any person ... under this Act  or\nthe Equal Pay Act 1970 ... or\n(c) otherwise done anything under or by reference to this Act or the Equal Pay Act 1970 ..., or\n(d) alleged that the discriminator  or  any  other  person  has  committed  an  act  which  (whether  or  not  the\nallegation so states) would amount to a contravention of this Act or give rise to a claim under the  Equal  Pay\nAct 1970 ...\nParagraphs (a) to (d) are known generally as \u2018protected acts\u2019. Like other discrimination or harassment, victimisation is\noutlawed only  for  certain  activities,  in  this  case  employment.  Section  6,  SDA  1975  outlaws  discrimination  by\nemployers in recruitment, access to opportunities or any other benefits, dismissal, or by causing  any  other  detriment.\n(Similar definitions are provided in  the  parallel  legislation:  Race  Relations  Act  1975,  ss  2  (victimisation)  and  4\n(employment); Disability Discrimination Act 1995, ss 55 and 4; Religion or Belief Regulations  2003,  regs  4  and  6;\nSexual Orientation Regulations 2003, regs 4  and  6,  Age  Regulations  2006,  regs  4  and  6;  Fair  Employment  and\nTreatment Order 1998 (NI) SI 1998\/3162, arts 3 and 19.)\nSo the elements appear to be: (1) the victim does  a  protected  act;  (2)  the  employer  treats  the  victim  less\nfavourably in recruitment, or access to benefits etc, or by dismissal, or any other detriment;  (3)  it  did  so  \u2018by  reason\nthat\u2019 the victim did the protected act.\n3. FACTS AND DECISION\nIn Derbyshire, 510 catering staff brought an equal pay claim. Most compromised, but 39 persisted. The employer then\nwrote directly to all 510 members of staff (bypassing their trade union and the claimants\u2019 solicitor) stating that  should\nthe claim succeed, the resulting cost was likely to cause redundancies. The employment tribunal found  that  the  letter\nwas \u2018effectively a threat\u2019, \u2018intimidating,\u2019  and \u2018directed against people who were in no position to debate the  accuracy\nof the ... pessimistic prognostications\u2019. Reasonable reactions could include \u2018surrender induced by fear,  fear  of  public\nodium or the reproaches of colleagues.\u2019 (\u00a74(d) of the ET Reasons, cited at \u00a738.)\nConsequently,  the  39  claimants  brought  a  separate   claim   of   victimisation.   They   succeeded   in   the\nemployment  tribunal.   The  EAT  agreed.  But  the  Court  of  Appeal  reversed.  The  House  of  Lords  restored   the\nemployment tribunal\u2019s decision. (In the event, the 39 persisted and won six times the compromise offer. The  price  of\na school meal increased by a third, and job losses were approximately 10%, with no redundancies.  See  [2004]  IRLR\n851, at \u00a716 EAT. )\n4. LEGAL BACKGROUND\nAt first sight, this attempt to bully litigants into abandoning  their  equal  pay  claim  appears  to  be  a  rather  obvious\nexample  of  victimisation.  That  the  case  progressed  to  House  of  Lords  can  be  explained  by  its  complex  legal\nbackdrop.  In  Chief  Constable  of  West  Yorkshire  Police  v  Khan  ([2001]  ICR   1065),   Sergeant   Khan   brought\nproceedings for racial discrimination against his employer. Whilst his claim was pending, he applied for job  with  the\nNorfolk Police. His employer, the Chief Constable,  acting  on  legal  advice,  refused  to  provide  a  job  reference  to\n\u2018protect his position in the discrimination claim\u2019. It seems that the Chief Constable was minded to provide  a  negative\nreference and his lawyers feared that this could be used against him in  the  discrimination  trial.  Consequently,  Khan\nbrought a separate claim of victimisation. The House of Lords unanimously rejected this claim, holding that the Chief\nConstable had not acted \u2018by reason that\u2019 Khan had brought proceedings,  because  the  employer  had  acted  \u2018honestly\nand reasonably\u2019 in accordance with \u2018perfectly understandable advice.\u2019 (See \u00a7\u00a731, 44, 59, and 80.)  In  coming  to  this\nconclusion the House relied on the distinction, made in Cornelius v University College of Swansea [1987] IRLR  141,\nat 145-146, CA, between a reaction to the bringing of proceedings (unlawful) and their existence (lawful).  Of  course,\nthe employer in Derbyshire relied on this analysis.\nHowever, the employment tribunal distinguished Khan, noting that  the  employer  wanted  the  applicants  to\nabandon their claims. It was reacting, \u2018if not to the commencement of proceedings, certainly to  their  continuance  ...\u2019\n(\u00a74(e), cited at \u00a755.)\nThe Court of Appeal, by a majority, reversed ([2006] ICR 90).  Lloyd  and  Parker,  LJJ,  applied  Khan,  and\nafter noting the distinction between the bringing  and  the  existence  of  the  proceedings,  held  that  the  \u2018honest  and\nreasonable\u2019  test  applied  equally  to  attempts  to  compromise  proceedings.  Thus  the  tribunal\u2019s  distinguishing   of\nKhan was an error of law (at \u00a7\u00a749, 55, and 75).\nA unanimous House of Lords restored the decision of the employment tribunal, holding that the tribunal  was\nentitled to come to its decision. Lord Bingham held that the tribunal was entitled to  distinguish  Khan  because:  \u2018The\ncontrast with the present case is striking and obvious, for the object of sending the letters was to  put  pressure  on  the\nappellants to  drop  their  claims.\u2019  (At  \u00a79.)  Lord  Hope  interpreted  the  tribunal\u2019s  reasoning  as  a  finding  that  the\nemployer\u2019s conduct \u2018while no doubt honest, could not be said to have been reasonable.\u2019 In  other  words,  the  tribunal\nhad applied Khan properly and was entitled to its finding of fact (at \u00a7\u00a717 and 28). Baroness Hale held that the  correct\ntest was whether the  employer\u2019s  conduct  caused  the  claimant  a  \u2018detriment\u2019.  As  the  tribunal  had  addressed  that\nquestion (see \u00a74(d), above), its decision could not be disturbed (at \u00a7\u00a736 and 39). Lord Neuberger  came  to  much  the\nsame conclusion (at \u00a7\u00a768 and 75), but added, in line with  Lord  Hope\u2019s  reasoning,  that  the  tribunal  had  found  the\nemployer\u2019s conduct  did  not  satisfy  the  \u2018honest  and  reasonable\u2019  test  (at  \u00a774).  Lord  Carswell  agreed  with  Lord\nNeuberger.\n5. THE REASONING OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS\nAlthough the House was unanimous in the decision, the reasoning varied. Four law  lords  gave  speeches,  with  Lord\nBingham agreeing with them all (at \u00a79), Baroness Hale (\u00a742) and Lord Carswell (\u00a743) agreeing with Lord Neuberger,\nLord Hope agreeing with Lord Neuberger on the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision (\u00a716), but not on  the  meaning  of  Khan\n(or Cornelius). However, Lord Neuberger agreed with Lord Hope\u2019s entire opinion (\u00a771). From this it can be  deduced\nthat Lord Neuberger\u2019s is the leading judgment.\nA. The \u2018Honest and Reasonable\u2019 Defence and \u2018Any Other Detriment\u2019\nIn Khan Lord Nicholls said:\nEmployers, acting honestly and reasonably,  ought  to  be  able  to  take  steps  to  preserve  their  position  in\npending discrimination proceedings without  laying  themselves  open  to  a  charge  of  victimisation.  ...  An\nemployer who conducts himself in this way is not doing  so  because  of  the  fact  that  the  complainant  has\nbrought discrimination proceedings. He is doing so  because,  currently  and  temporarily,  he  needs  to  take\nsteps to preserve his position in the outstanding proceedings. (\u00a731.)\nLord Neuberger stated that whilst this conclusion was correct, its judicial analysis and subsequent interpretation  were\n\u2018not entirely satisfactory\u2019. (\u00a765.) He gave three reasons. First, no such defence is provided by the legislation.  Second,\nit placed a \u2018somewhat uncomfortable and unclear meaning on the words \u201cby reason that\u201d\u2019. (\u00a765.)  Third,  it  suggested\nthat the matter should be judged from the point  of  view  of  the  employer,  when  it  should  be  \u2018primarily  from  the\nperspective of the alleged victim\u2019. (\u00a766.)\nFrom this, Lord Neuberger reasoned, when considering the employer\u2019s defence or reaction to proceedings, \u2018a\nmore satisfactory conclusion\u2019 was to focus on the element \u2018detriment\u2019 rather than \u2018by reason that\u2019. (\u00a768.)  This  test  is\nobjective: \u2018a detriment exists if a reasonable worker would or might take the view that the [treatment]  was  in  all  the\ncircumstances to his detriment\u2019 (citing Brightman, LJ, Ministry of Defence v  Jeremiah  [1980]  ICR  13  at  31).  Lord\nNeuberger speculated:\nIf ... the employer\u2019s solicitor were to write to the employee\u2019s solicitor setting out, in  appropriately  measured\nand accurate terms, the financial or employment consequences of the claim  succeeding,  or  the  risks  to  the\nemployee if the claim fails, or terms of settlement which are unattractive to the employee, I do  not  see  how\nany distress thereby induced in the employee could be said to constitute  \u2018detriment\u2019  ...  The  bringing  of  an\nequal pay claim, however strong the claim may be, carries with it, like any other litigation inevitable  distress\nand worry. Distress and worry which may be induced by the employer\u2019s  honest  and  reasonable  conduct  in\nthe course of his defence or in the conduct of any settlement negotiations, cannot (save, possibly, in the most\nunusual circumstances) constitute \u2018detriment\u2019 for the purposes of sections 4 and 6 of the 1975 Act. (\u00a768)\nThus, the employer\u2019s  attempts  to  settle  became  unlawful  by  \u2018going  public\u2019.  Otherwise  it  seems  normal  private\nresponses in discrimination litigation will not amount to victimisation.\nLord Neuberger\u2019s third reason for this change of approach was EU law, which applied in this case,  but  not  in  Khan,\nwhich pre-dated the Race Directive (2000\/43). In the victimisation case, Coote v  Granada  ((C-185\/97)  [1998]  ALL\nER (EC) 865, at \u00a724) the ECJ focused on the deterrent effect of the employer\u2019s act  on  workers.  In  other  words,  the\nconsideration was from the perspective of the worker, rather the employer.\nLord Hope took a similar line (\u00a7\u00a724-27), but Baroness Hale alone was more trenchant, succinctly stating:  \u2018It\nwould be better if the [\u2018honest and  reasonable\u2019]  \u201cdefence\u201d  were  laid  to  rest  and  the  language  of  the  legislation,\nconstrued in the light of the requirements  of  the  Directives,  applied.\u2019  Baroness  Hale  reduced  her  analysis  to  the\nstatutory elements (\u00a736).\nLord Neuberger attempted the seemingly impossible task of finding a just result without reversing Khan. The\ntrick was switching the \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence to the element of \u2018any  other  detriment\u2019.  His  logic  was  that\nhonest and reasonable conduct by the employer equates to causing the worker no detriment. That rings true around the\nfacts of Derbyshire, and especially where the employer acted unreasonably, but this will not always be so, as the facts\nof Khan, and some variations, demonstrate.\nIn Khan, if a reference were provided it would have been negative and reduced  Sergeant  Khan\u2019s  chance  of\nbeing selected. So it was arguable he suffered no detriment. But as Lord Hoffman said, the  employment  tribunal  has\njurisdiction to award compensation for injury to feelings, and so the courts have  given  the  term  \u2018detriment\u2019  a  wide\nmeaning. Lord Hoffman adopted the interpretation of \u2018detriment\u2019 given by Brightman,  LJ,  in  Jeremiah  (above)  and\nheld: \u2018Mr Khan plainly did take the view, ... that not having his assessment forwarded was to his detriment  and  I  do\nnot think that, in his state of knowledge at the time, he can be said to have been unreasonable\u2019  ([2001]  ICR  1065,  at\n\u00a753). Lord Nicholls reasoned:  \u2018I  accept  Sergeant  Khan\u2019s  claim  that  the  refusal  to  provide  a  reference  for  him\nconstituted a detriment ... even though ... this did  not  cause  him  any  financial  loss.  Provision  of  a  reference  is  a\nnormal feature of employment.\u2019 (\u00a714.)\nLord Neuberger said that applying his \u2018detriment\u2019 test  to  the  facts  of  Khan  would  produce  an  \u2018identical\u2019\nresult (\u00a768). But this overlooks the holding in Khan that the claimant had suffered a detriment (also at  \u00a7\u00a7  37  &  38).\nNot only is Lord  Neuberger\u2019s  opinion  effectively  overruling  Khan  on  this  point,  it  is  ignoring  the  two  reasons\nunderpinning that decision, that the legislation envisages liability  purely  for  injury  to  feelings,  and  the  dictum  of\nBrightman, LJ in Jeremiah.\nIt also overlooks the fact that the Chief Constable did more than merely abstain from  providing  a  reference.\nHe wrote to the Norfolk Police explaining why: that Khan had brought industrial tribunal proceedings. That is enough\nto dissuade many employers from selecting a candidate, and even if that did not happen in Khan\u2019s case,  a  reasonable\nworker would be entitled to fear so. This alone would cause a detriment.  (See  the  US  case  Rutherford  v  American\nBank of Commerce, 565 F 2d 1162, at 1164 (10th Cir 1977).)\n               Further, in many cases, withholding a negative reference will cause the claimant a detriment simply  because\nhe will present an incomplete application, excluding him from any selection process.\nFinally, Lord Neuberger\u2019s opinion confines its logic to  the  unusual  situation  where  a  reference  would  be\nnegative. Where a reference would be positive (or neutral), its withholding is even more likely  to  cause  a  detriment.\nOf course, the employer may be withholding the reference for the same (\u2018honest and  reasonable\u2019)  motive  as  Khan\u2019s\nemployer: a positive reference could be used against the  employer  in  the  principal  proceedings  (see  the  US  case,\nSparrow v Piedmont 593 F Supp 1107, at 1112 (MDNC 1984)).\nIn these scenarios, an honest and  reasonable  response  is  likely  to  cause  a  detriment.  They  demonstrate,\ncontrary to Lord Neuberger\u2019s  opinion,  that  \u2018honest  and  reasonable\u2019  conduct  cannot  be  equated  with  causing  no\ndetriment.\nMoreover, there are reasons why an \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence should be purged from  any  element  of\nvictimisation. First and most obvious, the reasons given by Lord Neuberger for ruling out an \u2018honest  and  reasonable\u2019\ndefence for the causative element (it does not appear in the  legislation,  and  the  matter  should  be  viewed  from  the\nworker\u2019s perspective) apply as cogently to the element of detriment.\nSecond, many employer responses could be characterised, not as \u2018any other detriment\u2019, but as discrimination\nin relation to \u2018access to benefits\u2019 under say, SDA 1975, s 6(2)(a). This would include  the  suspension  of  a  grievance\nprocedure, transfer rights, or indeed, the withholding of a reference (as Lord Mackay found in Khan, at \u00a738). In  these\ncases, the honest and reasonable defence, logically tied as Lord Neuberger would have it, to the element of  detriment,\nbecomes redundant.\nThird, such a defence has been ruled out of the similarly formulated definition  of  direct  discrimination  (for\n\u2018protected  act\u2019  read  the  protected  ground,  such  as  race,  sex,  age  etc).  A   benign   motive   defence   for   direct\ndiscrimination would do catastrophic damage  to  the  aims  of  the  legislation.  It  would  be  a  good  defence  for  an\nemployer to show that he discriminated not because he  intended  to  do  so  but  (for  example)  because  of  customer\npreference, or to save money, or avoid controversy (see R v Birmingham City Council, ex  parte  Equal  Opportunities\nCommission [1989] 1 AC 1156, at 1194; R. v Commission for Racial Equality Ex p. Westminster City Council  [1985]\nICR 827, CA). In Nagarajan v LRT [2001] AC 502, HL,  Lord  Steyn  asserted  that  \u2018victimisation  was  as  serious  a\nmischief as direct discrimination\u2019 and \u2018common sense\u2019 suggested the same approach (\u00a779).\nFourth, another, albeit  lesser,  danger  associated  such  a  defence  in  victimisation  is  that  a  tribunal  may\ninadvertently broaden the defence by inverting the question and demanding that for liability the  employer  must  have\nacted dishonestly and unreasonably (see Chief Constable of  Norfolk  v  Arthurton    (2006)  UKEAT\/0436\/06\/DM,  at\n\u00a725. See Employmentappeals.gov.uk.) Here, the employer need only show that  its  response  was  say,  not  dishonest\neven though it was unreasonable, (and less likely, vice versa). For instance,  an  employer  may  threaten  to  expose  a\nclaimant\u2019s extra-marital affair should she persist with her claim; or report the worker\u2019s  suspected  fraudulent  conduct\nit to the police only  after  the  worker  instigated  discrimination  proceedings  (see  the  US  case  Berry  v  Stevenson\nChevrolet 74 F 3d 980,  at  989  (10th  Cir  1986)).  Such  responses  may  be  characterised  as  unreasonable,  but  not\nnecessarily dishonest.\nThere is no doubt that the House of Lords is driven by a certain sympathy for the employer\u2019s dilemma,  even\nthough, as it acknowledged, it is the worker\u2019s perspective that counts. After all, a worker may risk a frozen  career  for\nbringing proceedings, for several years if it goes to appeal. In the United States the courts  have  avoided  any  \u2018benign\nmotive\u2019 defence for much the same reasoning given above (see EEOC v Board of Governors  957  F  2d  424  (7th  Cir\n1996)). The stateside approach to this difficulty is to take  a  more  robust  view  of  what  constitutes  less  favourable\ntreatment. In Burlington Railway v White 126 S  Ct  2405  (2006),  the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  the  victimisation\nprovision \u2018protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces  an  injury  or  harm.\u2019  And\nthis meant that \u2018a reasonable employee would have  found  the  challenged  action  materially  adverse,  which  in  this\ncontext  means  it  well  might  have  dissuaded  a  reasonable  worker   from   making   or   supporting   a   charge   of\ndiscrimination.\u2019 The Court emphasised that context matters: \u2018A schedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may\nmake little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously  to  a  young  mother  with  school  age  children.\u2019\nHowever: \u2018An employee\u2019s decision to report  discriminatory  behavior  cannot  immunize  that  employee  from  those\npetty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees  experience.\u2019  The  Court  noted\nthat \u2018personality conflicts at work that generate antipathy\u2019  and  \u2018snubbing\u2019  by  supervisors  and  co-workers\u2019  are  not\nactionable. (At 2414-2415.) On the facts, the Court upheld findings that a reassignment from forklift duty to  standard\ntrack labourer tasks, and a 37-day suspension without pay (where the pay was restored at the end  of  the  suspension),\neach amounted to less favourable treatment.\nB. The Distinction Between the Bringing and the Existence of Proceedings\nThe decision in Khan relied on this distinction, first aired in Cornelius v University College of Swansea. The speeches\nin Derbyshire did not question this distinction, with Lords Bingham (who presided in Cornelius)  and  Hope  citing  it\nwith approval (see \u00a7\u00a79, 21 and 23). In Cornelius, the  claimant  brought  sex  discrimination  proceedings  against  her\nemployer. Pending the outcome the employer refused her a transfer request  and  access  to  the  grievance  procedure.\nConsequently she brought a separate  claim  for  victimisation.  The  Court  of  Appeal  rejected  her  claim  inter  alia\nbecause:\nThe existence of the  proceedings  plainly  did  influence  [the  employer\u2019s]  decisions.  No  doubt,  like  most\nexperienced administrators, they recognised the risk of acting in a way which might embarrass  the  handling\nor be inconsistent with the outcome of current proceedings. They accordingly wished to defer action until the\nproceedings were over. But that had ... nothing to do with the  appellant\u2019s  conduct  in  bringing  proceedings\nunder the Act. (At 145-146.)\nThe futility of this distinction is realised by adding a second protected act to  the  claim:  under  SDA  1975,  s  4(1)(c)\n(see above), the  claimant  had  \u2018otherwise  done  anything  under  or  by  reference  to  this  Act\u2019.  As  well  as  having\nbrought proceedings, she was \u2018otherwise\u2019 maintaining them in existence. The fragility of the distinction was  exposed\nwhen  the  employment  tribunal  in  Derbyshire  made  a  third  distinction:  that  the  employer  reacted   not   to   the\ncommencement or existence of proceedings, but to their \u2018continuance\u2019. (See \u00a74(e), above.)\nFurther, this fine distinction between the bringing and existing of proceedings shows a  drift  away  from  the\n\u2018straightforward\u2019 approach adopted by the House of Lords in Nagarajan, where Lord Nicholls said (at 71):  \u2018...  in  the\napplication of this legislation legalistic phrases, as well as subtle distinctions, are better avoided so far as possible.\u2019\nThis distinction was devised with the employer\u2019s perspective in mind. Now that the  perspective  has  shifted\nto the worker, the distinction serves no useful purpose and should be disregarded.\n6. DETERRING OTHER WORKERS\nA  broader  issue  was  left  untouched  in  this  judgment.  For  policy  reasons,  it  is  arguable  that  the  victimisation\nprovisions should cover the deterrent effect of the employer\u2019s reaction on other workers. (A \u2018general deterrent\u2019 policy\nhas been adopted expressly by some Circuits in the United States:  eg  Hashimoto  v  Dalton  118  F  3d  671  (9th  Cir\n1997).) As noted above, the House of Lords in Derbyshire took recourse to EU law, in particular Coote v Granada, to\nswitch the focus to the perspective of the worker. It is arguable that Granada goes further than that.\nThe ECJ\u2019s focus in Granada was on the \u2018deterrent\u2019  effect  of  the  employer\u2019s  reaction,  suggesting  that  an\nemployer could be liable for deterring workers generally, even if the  reaction  caused  no  detriment  to  the  claimant.\nTake Khan again. Even if it could be said (as the House in Derbyshire asserted) that Sergeant  Khan  himself  suffered\nno detriment, the act of withholding the reference still  sent  a  signal  to  other  workers  (most  of  whom  presumably\nwould receive positive references) making them think twice before complaining of discrimination. That would, in  the\nwords  of  the  ECJ,  \u2018jeopardise  implementation  of  the  aim  pursued  by  the  Directive\u2019.  (\u00a724.)   The   decision   in\nGranada supports this interpretation. Mrs Coote sued her employer following her dismissal for being  pregnant.  After\nthose proceedings were dead, the employer refused to give her a reference and Mrs  Coote  sued  again,  this  time  for\nvictimisation.   The   question   referred   to   the   ECJ    was    whether    victimisation    provisions    should    protect\nformer employees. Predictably, the ECJ ruled that they should. However, although the refusal of a reference may have\ncaused her a detriment, it could not be said to have deterred her,  because  at  the  time  her  pregnancy  discrimination\nclaim was complete. So the ECJ\u2019s concern must have been for the broader deterrent effect of  the  employer\u2019s  act.  As\nthe House chose to revisit the facts of Khan, a comment on this issue would have been welcome.\n7. CONTEMPT OF COURT\nAs Bingham, LJ (as he then was) observed in Cornelius, the victimisation provisions had an \u2018obvious although partial\nanalogy to the law of contempt\u2019. (At p 145.) In addition to victimisation, it is arguable that  this  case  was  so  serious\nthat the employer was in contempt of court by placing public pressure on the claimants to abandon their claim.\nThe relevant contempt here is conduct interfering with the administration of justice, which  can  be  unlawful\nat common law, or under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, which applies strict liability, but only to publications.  The\nletters sent by the employer were \u2018publications\u2019 for this purpose. \nThe  High  Court  or  Court  of  Appeal  is  empowered  to  punish  for  contempt  where  the  contempt  is  in\nconnection  with  employment  tribunal  proceedings  (Civil  Procedure   Rules   1998   SI   1998\/3132,   Sch   1,   rule\n52.1(2)(a)(iii); Peach Grey v Sommers [1995] ICR 549, at 557-559; Harris v Lewisham &  Guy\u2019s  NHS  Trust   [2000]\nICR 707, at \u00a7\u00a7 17 & 32, CA; or CCA 1981, s 19).\nThe Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 7, limits the persons who may bring proceedings  to  the  Attorney-\nGeneral, or anyone with his consent, or by the court with jurisdiction over the contempt.  At  common  law,  there  are\nexamples of individuals with sufficient interest instigating contempt proceedings  with  punishment  as  the  goal  (see\nConnolly v Dale [1996] QB 120, at 125; Raymond v Honey [1983] 1 AC 1, HL; In Re  the  William  Thomas  Shipping\nCompany [1930] 2 Ch 36.) Precedent suggests that even if the Attorney-General or a court failed  to  act,  someone  in\nthe position of Ms Derbyshire could instigate common law contempt proceedings against her employer.\nA modern and flagrant example of contempt occurred in Attorney-General v Hislop [1991] 1  QB  514.  Here\nthe satirical  magazine  Private  Eye  published  defamatory  articles  about  Sonia  Sutcliffe  (wife  of  the  \u2018Yorkshire\nRipper\u2019) suggesting that she knew her husband was a murderer and  gave  the  police  false  alibis.  Ms  Sutcliffe  sued\nPrivate Eye for libel. Before the trial, Private Eye repeated the allegations  pointing  out  that  Ms  Sutcliffe  would  be\ncross-examined on them. The Court of Appeal  held  that  the  articles  were  designed  to  pressurise  Ms  Sutcliffe  to\nabandon her claim and as such they amounted to contempt at common law and  under  the  1981  Act.  McCowan,  LJ\nstated that there is:\n[A]ll the difference in the world between a private  discussion  between  lawyers  aimed  at  bringing  to  Mrs\nSutcliffe\u2019s attention that she might be cross-examined about  certain  matters  and  holding  her  up  to  public\nobloquy in terms neither  fair  nor  temperate  but  of  abuse,  which  is  what  I  conclude  without  hesitation\noccurred in this case. (At 535.)\nAnd Nicholls, LJ, observed: \u2018There is an enormous difference between bringing home to an opponent the  strength  of\none\u2019s own position and the weakness of his, and vilifying him in public.\u2019 (At 530.)\nIn many ways Derbyshire and Hislop are  alike.  There  was  private  pressure  to  abandon  the  proceedings.\nThere was public pressure (a fortiori on daily basis, in person from work colleagues). Third, there was public \u2018odium\u2019\nor  \u2018obloquy\u2019.  The  difference  is  that  the  letters  were  not  misrepresentations   (in   the   ordinary   legal   sense   of\nmisstatements of existing fact),  even  though  the  forebodings  never  materialised.  It  should  be  noted  though,  the\neditor\u2019s belief at the time that the allegations were true was considered irrelevant to liability (526-527  &  531).  More\nimportantly, the emphasis in Hislop was not on the untruthfulness of the articles, but on their effect upon the  claimant\n(526), suggesting that untruthfulness is not a necessary  ingredient  for  contempt.  In  Hutchison  v  AEU  (1932)  The\nTimes 25th August, p 4, the Daily Worker attacked a litigant who was seeking an injunction to prevent his  removal  as\nunion president, stating that union members \u2018will no doubt have no mercy  upon  those  who  seek  to  upset  working-\nclass decisions in the capitalist courts.\u2019 Goddard, J found the newspaper guilty of contempt for the  pressure  it  placed\non the litigant as well as possible witnesses. The attack contained no misrepresentations.\nFinally, for the Contempt of Court Act 1981 only, section 5 contains a \u2018defence\u2019 where a publication is in the\npublic interest and made in good faith. In Hislop,  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  as  the  articles  were  intended  to\ndissuade Ms Sutcliffe from pursuing her claim, they could not have been made in good faith. The  same  logic  applies\nhere. The sole reason for the sending out the letters was to pressurise the claimants  into  abandoning  their  equal  pay\nclaim.\nAny conduct coming close to one of the most flagrant and notorious contempts  of  modern  times  must  risk\nbeing in contempt of court. The employer\u2019s  conduct  in  Derbyshire  did  that.  The  employer  should  consider  itself\nfortunate that this went unnoticed by the courts and the Attorney-General.\n8. CONCLUSION\nThis was an easy case to decide, but in reconciling the decision with an \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence, the House of\nLords perpetuated a bad law and fell short of offering  clarity  and  guidance  on  the  meaning  of  victimisation.  This\nobvious and flagrant case of victimisation (conceivably amounting to contempt) took  several  years  and  a  House  of\nLords decision to decide because of the \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence postulated  in  Khan,  which  encouraged  the\nemployer to think it could bully the claimants  with  impunity.  The  House  did  little  to  lay  the  defence  to  rest,  as\nBaroness Hale alone advised. Instead, it transferred it to another element, whilst at the same time  articulating  reasons\nwhy it has no place in the law of victimisation. The only useful guidance suggests that normal private  negotiations  to\ncompromise should be lawful. Any broader guidance, that honest and reasonable  conduct  by  the  employer  will  not\ncause a detriment, is off little use, because \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 conduct will not  necessarily  equate  with  causing\nno detriment.\nThe better view is to follow Baroness Hale\u2019s approach, and do no more than apply the plain  words  of  the  legislative\nformula, bearing in mind ECJ policy. As the House itself implied, an \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence - based  as  it  is\non the employer\u2019s perspective - would not survive a challenge  in  the  ECJ,  and  so  eventually  it  should  perish.  As\ndomestic employment discrimination legislation  falls  within  EU  jurisdiction,  tribunals  should  feel  free  to  follow\nBaroness Hale\u2019s advice and disregard employer\u2019s attempts to introduce this defence into the victimisation provisions.\nMICHAEL CONNOLLY\nUniversity of Westminster\n"}
