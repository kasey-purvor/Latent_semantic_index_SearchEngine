INTRODUCTION\nA starting-point, from a microscopic point of view, to the\nsolution of quantum many-body problems is the mean-field\napproach. Depending on the system of interest, the mean\nfield might take the form of, for example, Hartree-Fock, a\ndensity functional or the local density approximation. Each\nof these approaches can include time-dependence to yield\ntime-dependent mean field \u0001TDMF\u0002 equations. A code which\nsolves TDMF equations gives one access to a laboratory in a\ncomputer, in which ones many-body objects of interest \u0001e.g.,\nnuclei, atoms, molecules, or metal clusters\u0002 can interact with\neach other or with external fields.\nPractical realizations of TDMF are often implemented us-\ning coordinate space grids, with the coupled nonlinear\nTDMF equations solved using finite difference techniques. A\nparticular numerical issue that arises in such codes is to deal\nwith the boundaries. For many dynamical processes of inter-\nest, particles will be emitted from the system, which means\nthat the wavefunctions representing them will reach the\nboundary of the grid. Typical boundary conditions, which\ncan be implemented without computational expense are re-\nflecting and periodic boundary conditions. In the first case,\noutgoing particle flux is reflected back into the system, and\nin the second it reappears on the other side of the grid. This\nis essentially never the physical situation one is interested in,\nand will lead to artefacts in the physical results of the calcu-\nlation. In the case of nuclear heavy-ion collisions, for ex-\nample, the interference with the reflected particle flux dis-\nturbs the motion of the reaction partners.\nThe present work seeks to explore some of the problems\nassociated with boundary conditions in TDMF applications.\nAs a test case, we consider the breathing dynamics of 16O in\nvarious dynamical regimes. In the linear regime, we scruti-\nnize the description of nuclear giant resonance spectra. In the\nnonlinear regime, we check particle emission as one typical\nobservable. To highlight the importance of absorbing bounds,\nand the wide applicability of the time-dependent mean-field\nmethod we also consider the case of two colliding 16O nu-\nclei.\nNuclear giant resonances are highly collective excitations\nwhich carry a lot of interesting information about nuclear\nstructure and dynamics. For a recent review of theoretical\nand experimental work on giant resonances in general, see\n\u00031\u0004. The resonances occur above neutron emission threshold,\nin all regions of the nuclear chart, and at various channels of\nmultipolarity, L, spin, S and isospin T. Being above thresh-\nold, all giant resonances are heavily damped. Their width\narises in three ways \u00032,3\u0004: The Landau width, due to frag-\nmentation, i.e., the spreading of the initial multipole excita-\ntion over the many single-particle excitations in energetic\nvicinity \u0001giant resonances are coherent sums of single par-\nticle excitations caused by one-body operators\u0002. The decay\nwidth is caused by the emission of particles into the con-\ntinuum, and the collisional width by the coupling of the\n1p-1h \u0001one particle, one hole\u0002 states with nearby higher or-\nder states \u00012p-2h, 3p-3h, and so on\u0002 in the compound\nnucleus. The TDMF approach to nuclear giant resonances\nbegins with a static Hartree-Fock calculation to define the\nground state \u00034\u0004. Excitations are then generated using an ex-\nternal perturbation in a time-dependent Hartree-Fock\n\u0001TDHF\u0002 approach. Although collective, they stay generally\nin the linear regime of small amplitude motion. This allows\none to linearize TDHF yielding the random phase approxi-\nmation \u0001RPA\u0002 \u00035,6\u0004, which is a standard treatment of the\nexcitation \u00037\u201310\u0004, sometimes reaching out to more sophisti-\ncated beyond-RPA techniques \u000311,12\u0004. For nonsymmetric\nground states as, e.g., in deformed nuclei, the conceptually\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 036709 \u00012006\u0002\n1539-3755\/2006\/73\u00013\u0002\/036709\u000111\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society036709-1\nsimpler full TDHF treatment remains competitive with lin-\nearized versions and has become increasingly used \u000313\u201316\u0004.\nFor treating dynamics in the nonlinear regime, full TDHF is\nanyway compulsory. A similar situation is found also in clus-\nter physics where the dynamical calculation of resonance ex-\ncitations is called the time-dependent local-density approxi-\nmation \u0001TDLDA\u0002. For an extensive review \u0001see \u000317\u0004\u0002. The\nconsiderations of this paper are also relevant to these appli-\ncations in atomic, molecular and cluster physics.\nUsing standard reflecting or periodic boundary conditions\nin TDHF or RPA results in an artificial discretization of the\nexcitation spectrum. From a physical point of view, it means\nthat one is able to describe the gross structure of spectra\nincluding the Landau width. A proper description of con-\ntinuum structure, in particular of the decay width, requires\nabsorbing or open boundary conditions. Several techniques\nhave been employed for nuclear continuum RPA \u000318\u201323\u0004.\nOnly a subset of such methods is applicable to fully fledged\nTDHF, or TDLDA. The most widely used methods there are\nimaginary absorbing potentials, which have been applied in\nnuclear and atomic physics \u000314,25\u0004, and multiplicative masks\napplied to damp the wavefunctions \u000326\u0004. These tools remove\nparticles impinging on the surface of the box from further\ncomputation and thus approximate open boundaries. In the\nlinear regime, they provide an interesting alternative to the\noften very elaborate continuum RPA techniques. It is the aim\nof this paper to investigate the quality and expense of the\nimaginary potential and multiplicative mask approach to ab-\nsorbing boundary conditions in TDHF. For the linear re-\nsponse regime, we also compare with simulation of the con-\ntinuum through driect smoothing techniques in the spectral\nanalysis. For these calculations, we employ a one-\ndimensional code \u0001for radial motion\u0002 in order to use a huge\nvariety of grid sizes for extensive tests. A confirmation is\nmade of the broad usefulness of absorbing boundary condi-\ntions by looking also at a full three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 TDHF\ncalculation of a collision of two 16O nuclei.\nWe shall, in Sec. II, briefly summarize the TDHF ap-\nproach and its practical implementation. Our giant resonance\ntest case is described in Sec. III, and the issues related to\nhard boundary conditions detailed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we\nmake the analysis of absorption on the TDHF calculations,\nand in Sec. VI appears the study of smoothing in the spectral\nanalysis, and a summary of all results for the linear case.\nConsiderations of nonlinear breathing-mode excitations are\ngiven in Sec. VII, with a discussion of collisions in Sec. VIII.\nSection IX concludes.\nII. TIME-DEPENDENT HARTREE-FOCK\nNuclear time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations belong\nto the realm of the time-dependent density functional theory\n\u000327\u0004 where a many-body system is described in terms of\nsingle-particle wavefunctions \u0002\u0003 and the local densities and\ncurrents build therefrom. The equations-of-motion are de-\nrived variationally from a given energy-density functional\n\u00034\u0004. They read in quite general fashion\ni\u0004\u0002\u02d9\u0003 = h\u02c6\u0002\u0003 \u00011\u0002\nwhere h\u02c6 is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian which itself de-\npends on the actual wavefunctions via the densities. It thus\nconstitutes a nonlinear equation. Given an initial condition,\n\u0005\u0002\u0003\u0001r , t=0\u0002\u0006, Eq. \u00011\u0002 determines all \u0002\u0003 at all times. This\ntime-dependent mean-field theory naturally includes the Lan-\ndau width and can, in principle, also describe the decay\nwidth. The Landau width comes from the underlying single-\nparticle spectrum, which is inherent in the Hartree-Fock cal-\nculations. We will always see a fragmentation in the spec-\ntrum due to the Landau width, but the correct calculation of\nthe decay width will depend on the correct treatment of the\noutgoing particle flux at the boundary of the box. It is the\ndecay width with which this paper is concerned.\nThere are several time stepping schemes for the solution\nof the TDHF \u0001or TDLDA\u0002 equations. We use here the series\nexpansion of the exponential evolution \u000328\u0004. The TDHF\nequations are solved in practice in two steps. First, we per-\nform a preliminary half-time step\n\u0002\u02dc\u0003\u0001r\u0002 = exp\u0001\u2212 ih\u02c6 \u0001t\u0002\u0005t\/2\u0002\u0002\u0003\u0001r,t\u0002 . \u00012a\u0002\nThis is used to build an approximation to the mean-field h\u02dc at\nmid-time t+\u0005t \/2 in standard manner\n\u0005\u0002\u02dc\u0003\u0006 \u00de \u0006\u02dc, j\u02dc, . . . \u00de h\u02dc .\nThis then is used to perform the full step\n\u0002\u0003\u0001r,t + \u0005t\u0002 = exp\u0001\u2212 ih\u02dc\u0005t\u0002\u0002\u0003\u0001r,t\u0002 . \u00012b\u0002\nThe exponential is expanded in a power series and truncated\nat fourth order\nexp\u0001\u2212 ih\u02c6\u0005t\u0002 \u0007 \b\nn=0\n4\n\u0001\u2212 i\u0005t\u0002n\nn!\nh\u02c6n. \u00012c\u0002\nThis choice has been found to be a sensible compromise\nbetween computational expense and stability, when com-\nbined with a suitable step size. In this study we have found a\nstep size of \u0005t=0.25 fm\/c to be adequate when combined\nwith the fourth-order Taylor Series expansion \u00012c\u0002. Unless\nstated otherwise, this time step is used in all calculations\npresented. The repeated application of the time evolution op-\nerator gives a time series of wavefunctions and derived quan-\ntities. The quality of the propagation is tested against norm\nand energy conservation \u0001which applies for reflecting bound-\naries\u0002. The norm and energy are both conserved over the\nwhole observation time within 10\u22125. This figure can be im-\nproved \u0001or worsened\u0002 deliberately by adjusting the time\nstep\/or and number of terms retained in the Taylor Series\nexpansion \u00012c\u0002.\nIII. TEST SETUP\nAs a practical application, the case of isoscalar monopole\nvibrations in 16O is studied, using the Skyrme parameteriza-\ntion SkM* \u000329\u0004. Skyrme forces are effective nuclear interac-\ntions which reproduce the ground and certain excited state\nproperties of nuclei across the periodic table \u00034\u0004. They are\ngenerally fitted to basic ground state properties \u0001masses, ra-\ndii,\u00bc\u0002, and usually also including information from nuclear\nmatter. Many of them also provide a good description of\nREINHARD et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 036709 \u00012006\u0002\n036709-2\ngiant resonances, particularly for heavy nuclei while being\nless perfect for isovector modes in small nuclei \u00039,30\u0004. Note\nthat in the present paper we are not so much interested in a\ndetailed comparison with experiment, as in an exploration of\nnumerical issues. Therefore, we have chosen such a light\nnucleus to allow for widespread variations of the numerical\nconditions.\nTo create a monopole giant resonance, one must apply a\nsuitable external perturbation. In all calculations presented\nhere, the usual isoscalar monopole excitation operator\nF\u0001r\u0002 = r2, \u00013\u0002\nis used to both create and measure the oscillations. The ex-\ncitation is applied with a Gaussian time profile:\nVext\u0001r,t\u0002 = \u0007extF\u0001r\u0002fext\u0001t\u0002 , \u00014a\u0002\nfext\u0001t\u0002 = exp\t\u2212 \u0001t \u2212 \b0\u00022\n\bwid\n2 \n . \u00014b\u0002\nwith parameters\n\u0007ext = 0.01 MeV r\u22122, \b0 = 5 fm\/c, \bwid = 1 fm\/c.\n\u00014c\u0002\nThis short time-span of the external perturbation simulates\nthe brief impinging of a nuclear probe. It has a spectral width\nof about 200 MeV and thus ensures that oscillations of all\nfrequencies in the resonance range are excited with equal\nweight.\nThe spatial grid is set up with grid spacing \u0005r=0.3 fm.\nThe number of grid points, and with it the box size, is varied\nas a crucial parameter in the numerical study.\nIV. GENERAL FEATURES WITHOUT ABSORPTION\nThe isoscalar giant monopole resonance in 16O lies at\nabout 23 MeV which is of order 10 MeV above the con-\ntinuum threshold. As such, the emitted nucleons have an av-\nerage kinetic energy of about 10 MeV, corresponding to a\nmean velocity of v\u00070.14 c. The initial pulse \u00014\u0002 will thus\nrelease a bunch of nucleons which then travels along with\nthat velocity towards the bounds of the box. Reflecting\nboundary conditions turn the bunch back to the nuclear cen-\nter where it will reappear after a typical echo time\nTecho = 2Rbox\/v \u0007 14Rbox\/c. \u00015\u0002\nThe echo and its dependence on the box should be visible in\nthe recorded monopole signal. We can confirm this and see\nthe effect of hard \u0001=reflecting\u0002 boundary conditions by ex-\namining the echo delay time in the monopole response.\nFigure 1 shows the amplitude of monopole oscillations as\na function of time for various box sizes. In all three cases, the\ntime signal is the same at the outset, since the outgoing flux\ndid not have yet the time to reach the boundary. The ampli-\ntude of the oscillations decay in an exponential way, and\nwould in principle die down to zero, except that there is that\necho from reflux of nucleons reflected back from the bounds.\nThe time it takes for this to happen depends on the radius,\nRbox of the box as estimated in Eq. \u00015\u0002. Therefore, for Rbox\n=30, 60, and 120 fm, delays of 400, 800, and 1600 fm\/c are\nthe expected values in broad agreement with Fig. 1. Since\nthe outgoing particle flux contains components traveling at\ndifferent velocities, once can see that the shape of the return-\ning echo looks different for different box sizes, and in par-\nticular is the more stretched the larger the box.\nThis echo is, of course, artificial. It allows standing waves\nto set up in the box, which discretize the spectrum \u000313\u0004. In\nprinciple one could allow the box size to grow without limit,\nand obtain a closer and closer approximation to the con-\ntinuum result, a strategy which is discussed in Sec. VI B.\nOne can see from the top frame in Fig. 1 that the echo may\nbe delayed arbitrarily, delivering arbitrary resolution. But\none is bound by limits of computational time, and a finite\nbox size must be used; for example, the 1200 fm box of Fig.\n1 is too large for a three-dimensional calculation. One can\nestimate the necessary size of a \u0001reflecting\u0002 box according to\nthe wanted energy resolution. An unperturbed \u0001by the echo\nsignal\u0002 observation time of Tobs allows an energy resolution\nof about \t \/Tobs, and using Eq. \u00015\u0002 one can establish an esti-\nmate in terms of box size for the considered test case\n\n\u000becho =\n\t\nTobs\n=\nv\t\n2Rbox\n\u0007\n0.1c\nRbox\n. \u00016\u0002\nFor example, a Tobs\u00074000 fm\/c observation yields a\nresolution of \n\u000becho\u00070.14 MeV and requires a box of\nRbox\u0007300 fm.\nFIG. 1.

ABSORBING BOUNDS\nWhen the flux reaches the edge of the box, it should in\nprinciple continue out as if the boundary were not there. For\na finite box, this effect can be simulated using some kind of\nabsorbing boundary. The absorption of the outgoing wave, or\nsuppression of the echo will never be quite perfect, and the\nstudy of the optimal ways of applying these techniques is\ndiscussed here. The method for quantifying the quality of an\nabsorbing algorithm will in this section simply be the ampli-\ntude of the echo.\nThe two methods of simulating the absorbing boundary\nconditions considered in this study are the use of an imagi-\nnary potential and a masking function. For the first option, a\nlinear optical potential is used \u000314\u0004\nVopt = \u2212 iWopt\f\u0001r \u2212 Rbox\u0002\u0001r \u2212 Rbox\u0002 . \u00017\u0002\nThis potential is added to the mean-field Hamiltonian h\u02c6 in all\ntime steps. Note that the margin carrying the optical potential\nis added outside the original numerical box, i.e., outside Rbox.\nA certain number of absorbing points Nabs are used while\nkeeping the same grid spacing. The quality of absorption will\ndepend on the size of this absorbing margin. The masking\nfunction, on the other hand, supplements the time step \u00012\u0002 by\none masking step\n\u0002\u0003\u2192 \u0002\u0003 cos\t\t2 r \u2212 RboxRabs \n\np\n\u00018\u0002\napplied after the final sub-step \u00012b\u0002. This masking function\ninvolves the radial distance r= \u000br\u000b and is appropriate for the\nradial 1D problem treated here. Other geometries require\nother masks, see, e.g., \u000331\u0004. The Rabs=Nabs\u0005r is the added\nabsorbing margin and Nabs is the number of grid points over\nwhich the masking is applied. The \u0005r is the same radial grid\nspacing as used in the interior.\nBoth have much in common. In fact, one can map the\nmasking function into an equivalent optical potential. For\nsimplicity, we assume a mere first-order expansion of the\nexponential step, i.e., 1\u2212 i\nth\u02c6 . In this case the masking op-\neration can be achieved by employing an effective optical\npotential\nVopt\n\u0001eff\u0002\n= \u2212\ni\n\nt\n\f1 \u2212 cos\t\t2 r\r \u2212 RboxRabs \n\np\r \u0007 \u2212 i p\n\nt\n\t\t2 r\r \u2212 RboxRabs \n\n2\n.\n\u00019\u0002\nIt is obvious that the step size \nt plays a role: The shorter the\ntime step the stronger the optical potential. It is the combi-\nnation p \/\nt which determines the effective damping strength.\nFigure 2 shows an example of monopole oscillations com-\nputed with absorbing bounds of type \u00018\u0002 compared with a\nresult from reflecting bounds using the same box size. One\nsees a much reduced and somewhat delayed echo. The de-\nlayed echo is explained by the fact that the absorbing bounds\nare more efficient for fast particles such that the reflected\nwave has a higher content of slow velocities. Moreover, one\nsees also that the absorption is by no means perfect in that a\nvisible amount of back-flow is still seen. We now need to\nwork out optimal damping conditions for both methods by\nsystematically varying the parameters. In order to simplify\nthe analysis, we characterize the quality of absorption by one\nnumber: The maximum amplitude of the echo.\nFigure 3 shows the results of series of calculations for the\nmaximum echo amplitude as a function of the damping\nstrength Wopt for the optical potential or the power p for the\nmasking function. Two different numbers of extra absorbing\ngrid points, Nabs, are used and the size of the time step is also\nvaried in case of the masking function \u0001lower panel\u0002. Clearly\nin either prescription the larger absorbing margin performs\nbetter than the smaller, and the best echo reduction is about\nthe same. With Nabs=20, the reduction in amplitude ap-\nproached one order of magnitude. In the Nabs=100 case,\nFIG. 2. Monopole oscillation amplitude in the time domain.

Too small damping\nleaves an appreciable quantity of flux reflected back, whereas\ntoo large absorption causes reflection from the steep optical\npotential at the beginning of the absorbing region. A best\ncompromise is found in between. It is seen that, in the case\nof an imaginary potential, the optimum strength Wabs de-\npends on the number of absorbing points used. For the mask-\ning function with given time step \nt, the preferred value for\np is quite insensitive to Nabs, although altering the time step\nmoves the minimum which can be understood from the map-\nping \u00019\u0002 where the effective damping turns out to be p \/\nt. In\nboth cases, the choice of the optimum working point is not\nawfully critical.

The principles of spectral analysis\nThe most important physical observable associated with\ngiant resonances is the strength function. In the case of the\nisoscalar giant monopole resonances considered in this work,\nthis corresponds to the electric monopole strength associated\nwith a transition from the nuclear ground state to the giant\nresonance, as a function of energy. The strength function of\nan observable F\u02c6 is defined in general as\nS\u0001E\u0002 = \u2212\n1\n\t\nlim\n\n\u21920\nIm\u000e0\u000bF\u02c6\n1\nH \u2212 E + i\n\nF\u02c6 \u000b0\u000f , \u000110\u0002\nwhere Im stands for the imaginary part. It can be computed\nwith TDHF and spectral analysis as follows \u000324\u0004: One starts\nthe dynamical evolution at t=0 from the mean-field ground\nstate, applies the short pulse \u00014\u0002, and measures the F-signal\nover time\nF\u0001t\u0002 = \b\n\u0003\n\u000e\u0002\u0003\u0001t\u0002\u000bF\u02c6 \u000b\u0002\u0003\u0001t\u0002\u000f . \u000111a\u0002\nAt the end, one performs a Fourier transformation into the\nfrequency domain\nF\u02dc \u0001\u000b\u0002 = \u0010\n0\n\u000e\ndtei\u000btF\u0001t\u0002 \u000111b\u0002\nand similarly for the time profile of the excitation function\nf\u0001t\u0002\u2192 f\u02dc\u0001\u000b\u0002. The strength function is then finally\nSF\u0001\u000b\u0002 = \u2212\n1\n\t\nIm\u0011F\u02dc \u0001\u000b\u0002f\u02dc\u0001\u000b\u0002 \u0012 . \u000111c\u0002\nNote that the spatial form of the function F\u0001r , t\u0002 is to be\nexactly the same in the excitation \u00014\u0002 and in the analysis \u000111\u0002.\nIn the test case here, we use the isoscalar monopole \u00013\u0002.\nThe actual TDHF calculations stop, of course, at some\nfinite final time Tfin and the data are sampled on a discrete\nequidistant mesh t\r=\r\nt. We thus replace in practice the\nFourier integral by the Fourier series\nF\u02dc \u0001\u000bk\u0002 =\n\nt\n2\nF\u00010\u0002 + \b\n\r=1\nNfin\n\ntei\u000bkt\rF\u0001t\r\u0002 ,\n\u000bk = k\n\t\nTfin\n, k\u0001 \u00050, . . . ,Nfin\u0006 , \u000112\u0002\nwhere Tfin=Nfin\nt. This defines the strength on a mesh \u000bk in\nfrequency space. The maximal spectral resolution achievable\non the mesh is \u0004\t \/Tfin. For example, a simulation time of\nTfin=8000 fm\/c yields a spectral mesh spacing of 0.07 MeV.\nAn example of such a strength function is shown in Fig. 4. It\nis taken from the Fourier transform of a signal in which a\n1200 fm box was used along with an observation time of\n8192 fm\/c \u0001the first half was shown in the uppermost panel\nin Fig. 1\u0002, leading to a situation in which the outgoing flux\nhas not yet reached the boundary. The pattern looks already\nquite realistic as compared to typical experimental strength\ndistributions, although it is missing the additional contribu-\ntion from the collisional width which is beyond the capabili-\nties of a mean-field theory, but which is not so large for the\nisoscalar modes, particularly the monopole \u00033\u0004. Most struc-\ntures are very soft indicating a typical decay wdth of about\n1 to 2 MeV. Note the sharp spike at 30 MeV. This is a\nbound 1ph state \u0001the 1s\u21922s transition\u0002 embedded in the\ncontinuum. This figure, computed very carefully on a huge\nnumerical box and sampled over a long time interval, will\nserve as a benchmark for our further considerations.\nB. Filtering in the time domain\nThe spectral analysis thus far is unambiguous if the signal\nhas fully died down at the end, i.e., F\u0001Tfin\u0002=0. In more prac-\ntical calculations, however, one uses smaller boxes and\nmakes use of absorbing boundary conditions. Since the ab-\nsorption is not perfect, one obtains finite signals throughout\ndue to the echoes. The resulting forced cutoff at Tfin with\nfinite signals at the end of the interval gives rise to artefacts\nin the spectra \u000332\u0004. One has to apply some windowing to\nproduce smooth strength distributions. We use a windowing\nin the time domain multiplying the signal with a smooth\ncut-off function as\nFIG. 4. The continuum strength function for the isoscalar mono-\npole resonance in 16O with Skyrme force SkM*. A 1200 fm box\nwas used, and an observation time of 8192 fm\/c, so that the bound-\nary was not reached by the outgoing flux.\nROLE OF BOUNDARY CONDITIONS IN DYNAMIC\u00bc PHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 036709 \u00012006\u0002\n036709-5\nF\u0001r,t\u0002\u2192 F\u0001r,t\u0002cos\t t\t2Tfin\n\nNfilt\n\u000113\u0002\nand with even cut-off powers Nfilt. This filtering function has\nthe property that it dampens the effective signal to approach\na zero final value rapidly in a most smooth manner \u0001vanish-\ning derivatives up to order Nfilt\u22121\u0002. It approaches a Gaussian\nfor large values of Nfilt. The variation of the filtering strength\nNfilt allows to vary the full width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002\nof the effective signal. One has approximately\nFWHM = Tfin\u0013 2Nfilt . \u000114\u0002\nThe smoothing of the spectra by forced premature extinction\nof the signal has the price that one loses some spectral reso-\nlution. It now becomes\n\u0005\u000b\n2\t\nFWHM\n= \u00132Nfilt\n\t\nTfin\n. \u000115\u0002\nAs we will see, the deliberate sacrifice of resolution is nec-\nessary to provide a reasonable interpretation of the spectra in\ncase of no or insufficient absorption. We, therefore, prefer to\ncall \u0005\u000b a smoothing width. An example for filtering strength\nand related FWHM as well as smoothing widths is given in\nTable I. In practice, we find that mainly the final FWHM\ncounts in the achieved spectral pattern. It is then more effi-\ncient to use a low filtering strength of typically Nfilt=2 or 4\nwith correspondingly short simulation time Tfin.\nFigure 5 shows strength functions in the absence of any\nabsorbing boundary conditions. Each panel stands for one\nparticular choice of box size and compares different folding\nstrengths Nfilt, and accordingly different folding widths as\ntabulated in Table I. In the case of the smallest spectral\nsmoothing \u0005\u000b=0.05 MeV, one sees the sharp discrete spec-\ntrum that occurs in the absence of absorbing bounds. These\noccur at the frequencies of the RPA eigenmodes in the phase\nspace given by the finite box. As the size of the box is in-\ncreased, as seen in the different panels of Fig. 5 the increased\ndensity of states in the phase space is reflected in the in-\ncreased number of eigenmodes appearing in accordance with\nthe spectral density of single particle states in a spherical\npotential well.\nEnhancing the filtering strength, i.e., increasing the\nsmoothing width \u0005\u000b, changes the spectrum to a smother\npattern. Insufficient filtering leaves some oscillations about\nthe wanted continuum strength. Such oscillations could eas-\nily be misinterpreted as detailed fragmentation structures in\nthe spectra. One has to make sure that the smoothing width\n\n\u000b is larger than the \u0001artificial\u0002 level spacing in a finite\nspherical well which we we can read off in the energy range\naround 20 MeV approximately as \u0005E=3 and 0.8 MeV for\nthe box sizes Rbox=15 and 60 fm, respectively. For the\nsmaller box size of 15 fm, only the the largest smoothing\nwidth of \u0005\u000b=3.2 guarantees wiping out all artifacts. With\nthis largest spreading, the strength is close to the continuum\nresult, but lacks the finer points of its structure as, e.g., the\nspike at 30 MeV. This is due to the insufficient information\nobtained from the small phase space available to the dis-\ncretized calculation in small boxes, compared to the con-\ntinuum calculation.\nIn the case of the larger, 60 fm, box shown in the right\ntwo panels of Fig. 5, the \u0005\u000b=0.8 MeV spreading is already\nsufficient to smooth the discretized spectrum to resemble the\ncontinuum case since the discrete peaks are closer in energy\nthan in the 15 fm case.\nC. Competition between filtering and absorption\nWe thus have introduced two basically different ways to\nsimulate the smooth spectral distribution of strengths above\nemission threshold, the absorbing boundary conditions and\nstrong spectral filtering. We will investigate in this section\nthe combination of both methods, their cooperation or com-\npetition. Having ascertained the optimum values for the pa-\nrameters Wabs and p associated with the linear absorbing po-\ntential and masking function, respectively \u0001see Fig. 3\u0002, we\nselect these optimal values in each case, and study the effect\nof varying the number of absorbing points, Nabs, the box size,\nRbox and the smoothing width \u0005\u000b.\nFigure 6 repeats the analysis of Fig. 5, except that an extra\n20 absorbing points carrying the optical potential are used\nTABLE I.

Note\nthat the \u0005\u000b=0.05 results go well\nbeyond the y-axis range.\nREINHARD et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 036709 \u00012006\u0002\n036709-6\nbeyond the end of the box. One immediately sees that the\nsharp peaks of the lightly filtered spectra \u0001\u0005\u000b=0.05 MeV\u0002\nare dramatically reduced and smoothed out, somewhat like\nthe \u0005\u000b=0.8 MeV curve in Fig. 5 without the imaginary ab-\nsorbing potential. This is not surprising since the effect of the\nimaginary potential is to make the eigenmodes of the box\ncomplex, and hence damped. In spite of the dramatic reduc-\ntion, there remain still sizeable oscillations which leave the\npattern far from the goal. The small smoothing of 0.8 MeV\nimproves a lot, but still leaves some artifacts for the 20 fm\nbox. Only the largest smoothing finally helps here, however,\nat the price of overriding true structure in the spectrum, simi-\nlar to with the case of no absorption. For the 60 fm box, the\nmoderate smoothing with 0.8 MeV provides almost perfect\nagreement with the wanted spectrum.\nWe have seen up to now that larger smoothing widths\nallow approaching smooth spectra more easily. Too large a\nwidth, however, wipes out wanted physical structures. It\nseems that the largest acceptable smoothing is 0.8 MeV for\nthe present test case. We will have a closer look at that\nchoice. Choosing a fixed \u0005\u000b=0.8 MeV, Fig. 7 explores the\neffect of varying the number of absorbing points, Nabs, for\ntwo different box sizes. Without absorption, only even larger\nboxes would deliver a satisfying result. Increasing absorption\nallows dealing with smaller boxes and yet yields acceptable\nresults. With Nabs=20 a box of 60 fm suffices, and with\nNabs=100, we can step down to a box of 30 fm \u0001not shown\nhere\u0002 while reproducing the essential structures of the spec-\ntrum. The step from Nabs=0 to Nabs=20 constitutes a substan-\ntial gain in expense as we can give up 200 true grid points\n\u0001from Rbox=120 fm down to 60 fm\u0002 while adding only 20\npoints for the absorbing margin. The next step to Nabs=100\ndoes not gain as much, since we give up 100 true points and\nadd another 80 absorbing points.\nD. Summary of times and energies\nIn this section, we summarize briefly the key quantities\nfor the analysis of resonance spectra in the particle con-\ntinuum. Table II gives an overview. The average velocity of\nemitted nucleons v\u00af depends on the average resonance energy\nEres relative to the emission threshold Ethresh. It determines\nthe decay width \u000fdecay, the level spacing \n\u000bbox of the \u0001artifi-\ncial\u0002 discretization of the box, and the echo time Techo. Note\nthat \n\u000bbox accounts for the level spacing of the single\nnucleon states in the pseudo-continuum. The actual spacing\nbetween 1ph states looks much denser due to the overlay of\nstates related different hole states. But the spectral resolution\nis set by the density of continuum states as quantified in\nterms of \n\u000bbox. The decay width, in turn, sets the scale for\nthe wanted spectral resolution \u0005\u000b of the analysis. This, on\nthe other hand, has to overcome the pseudo-discretization of\nthe continuum in case that we work without absorbing\nbounds and rely fully on the spectral smoothing by window-\ning. The scales are then set by\n\u000fdecay\u0010\u0005\u000b\u0010 \n\u000bbox. \u000116\u0002\nThe \u0005\u000b is tuned by the simulation time Tfin in combination\nwith the filtering strength Nfilt. As finally only the net FWHM\ncounts, it is most efficient to use a low Nfilt=2 or 4 and to\nthus have the shortest possible Tfin. This holds with and with-\nout absorbing bounds. The second inequality in condition\n\u000116\u0002 applies to the case without absorbing bounds. It deter-\nmines the minimum box size Rbox required for that resolu-\nFIG. 6. Strength functions as Figure 5, but with Nabs=20.\nFIG. 7. Strength functions with and without absorbing bounds.

Invoking absorbing boundary conditions allows to use\nsmaller box sizes than required by the above condition. A\nreduction by a factor of two was found to be conceivable\nwith Nabs=20 extra grid points in the absorbing margin, and\na factor four with Nabs=100. The conceptually simplest, but\ncomputationally most expensive, way to produce a clean\nspectrum is to chose the box so large that the echo time Techo\nexceeds safely the decay time of the resonance and to per-\nform straightforward spectral analysis with the then cleanly\ndamped time signal.\nNote that this analysis is based on producing as authentic\na spectrum from the TDHF equations as possible. This, by\ndefinition, omits the width due to collisions. Inclusion of the\ncollision width will actually soften the above criteria, since it\ncontributes extra broadening and helps wash out artefacts.\nVII. TESTS IN THE NONLINEAR DOMAIN\nA major motivation for development and application of\nabsorbing boundary conditions comes from the realm of non-\nlinear mean-field dynamics. For the original atomic physics\ncase see, e.g., \u000325,26\u0004. The quest for good absorption persists\nalso for heavy-ion dynamics. Violent collisions will always\nbe accompanied by nucleon emission. One has to prevent\nthose emitted nucleons from falling back onto the reaction\nzone. We will investigate the performance of absorbing\nbounds in the nonlinear regime. Our test cases are the large\namplitude oscillation of 16O as induced by short force pulses\ntypically occuring in hefty collisions, and an actual collision\nbetween two 16O nuclei. Many observables in the nonlinear\ndomain are related to particle emission as, e.g., angular dis-\ntribution, kinetic energy distribution, net ionization \u000317\u0004. We\nconsider as one such observable the ionization from strong\nbreathing oscillations.\nWe simulate a very short force pulse by initial excitation\nwith a radial boost \u0002\u2192exp\u0001ipboostr2\u0002\u0002. The radial momen-\ntum pboost regulates the strength of the excitation. The energy\nimprinted to the system through the boost will be removed to\na large extent by particle emission. We measure the average\ntotal emission as the loss of the total normalization Nesc\u0001t\u0002\n=\u0014d3r\u0006\u0001r , t\u0002\u2212N\u0001t=0\u0002. One can also resolve in detail the par-\nticle loss from each single particle state separately as N\u0003\u0001t\u0002\n=\u0014d3r\u000b\u0002\u0003\u0001r , t\u0002\u000b2: With some combinatorial analysis, one can\ncompute from that the detailed probability P\u0001n , t\u0002 to find the\nstate with n emitted particles \u000333,34\u0004. We find in our tests\nagain the equivalence between the imaginary potential\nmethod \u00017\u0002 and the masking function technique \u00018\u0002. Thus we\nwill show only results for the imaginary potentials.\nFigure 8 shows the total emission finally achieved as\nfunction of the boost strength for a variety of absorbing mar-\ngins. The results do not depend so sensitively on the size of\nthe margin for this global observable. This shows that gross\neffects in the nonlinear regime can very well be estimated\nwith rather inexpensive small absorbing margins, which is\ncommon practice in most of these calculations.\nFigure 9 shows the more detailed emission probabilities\nfinally achieved, i.e., P\u0001n , t\u2192\u000e\u0002. Here we see slightly more\nsensitivity. The smallest margin shows small but visible de-\nviations. The three larger margins have already well con-\nverged. That is still much more robust than in the extremely\ncritical linear response regime.\nFigure 10 shows as another detail the total emission as\nfunction of time. Here we see again somewhat more sensi-\ntivity than in the global final value of Fig. 8. The qualitative\npattern are still reproduced for any margin. In particular, we\nsee that all margins are capable of final absorption and thus\nsuppressing the unwanted rebounce. But a more detailed\nanalysis will always require the larger margins.\nTABLE II.

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 73, 036709 \u00012006\u0002\n036709-8\nIn any case, we find that well adjusted absorbing bounds\nare a very efficient and reliable method in the domain of\nnonlinear dynamics. They are compulsory to avoid artefacts\nfrom reflected particle flow. On the other hand, rather afford-\nable small margins suffice in that case. This regime is thus\nmuch different from the linear response where rather large\nmargins are required for quantitative success and where al-\nternatives \u0001although not cheap either\u0002 exist.\nVIII. NUCLEAR COLLISIONS\nTo highlight the importance of absorbing bounds in non-\nlinear applications of TDHF, and to accentuate their wide\napplication, we have also studied collisions. As a test we\nagain use the 16O nucleus, this time colliding two such nuclei\nand examining the conservation of energy with and without\nabsorption. For this we use a full three-dimensional time-\ndependent Hartree-Fock code in which two separate 16O nu-\nclei are initialized, given a boost which sets them toward\neach other, and are allowed to collide.\nIn time-dependent Hartree-Fock the kinetic energy of\nrelative motion of two clusters is not an immediately avail-\nable quantity. Instead, it must be deduced using a two-body\nanalysis of the time-dependent density distribution.\nThe code first tries to determine whether the system has\nseparated into two fragments. For this purpose it calculates\nthe principal axes of the mass quadrupole tensor of the com-\nbined system. Then it examines the density along the axis of\nmaximum quadrupole moment to find whether it shows the\ncharacteristics of two maxima separates by a low-density re-\ngion. The point of lowest density along this line then defines\na dividing plane perpendicular to this axis, and two frag-\nments are assumed to exist on both sides of this plane. Cal-\nculating the centers of mass of each fragment yields a new\nstraight line connecting them, which is used to repeat the\nprocess. This is iterated until the definition of the fragment\ncenters of mass and the dividing plane have stabilized. The\nprincipal result of this analysis are the fragment masses and\ncharges Mi, Qi, i=1,2, the separation distance R of the frag-\nments, and the relative velocity R\u02d9 calculated from the values\nof R at two successive time steps \u0001for noncentral collisions\nthe angular momentum of c.m. motion can also be calcu-\nlated, but this is of no concern for the present discussion\u0002.\nFor head-on collisions the energy of relative motion can\nthen be calculated from the simple formula\nEcm\u0001R\u0002 =\n1\n2\nM1M2\nM1 + M2\nR\u02d9 2 +\nQ1Q2\nR\n, \u000117\u0002\nwhere the Coulomb energy is approximated by the expres-\nsion for two point charges.\nFigure 11 shows a calculation of the relative-motion en-\nergy Ecm\u0001R\u0002 for 16O+ 16O at an initial c.m. energy of\n125 MeV. An impression of the physical situation is given\nby the small insets. The two nuclei are initialized at a dis-\ntance of 16 fm, so that they have a distace of at least 5 fm to\ntravel towards each other before significant interaction sets\nin. The quantity Ecm for this \u201cincoming\u201d part of the reaction\nis shown in the upper curve. The initialization reduces the\nvalue of Ecm to about 124.80 MeV, but this value stays re-\nmarkably constant with changes below 0.02 MeV down to\nFIG. 9.

This shows that the numerical description of free\npropagation through the grid and the two-body analysis work\nquite well.\nTo add to the picture, it should be mentioned that during\nthe full collision calculation \u0001not only the initial phase\u0002 the\ntotal energy decreases by 0.02 MeV, while the total particle\nnumber fluctuates by about 0.01 nucleons.\nIn the final stages of reseparated fragments, however, the\nsituation appears quit different. The lower three curves in\nFig. 11 show that Ecm does not stay constant, as it should.\nThey correspond to different numerical and physical condi-\ntions, which do not lead to any differences in the \u201cincoming\u201d\npart of the collision.\nThe curve labeled \u201csmall mesh\u201d refers to a calculation on\na grid with 24\u001124\u001132 points with a spacing of 1 fm. The\nboundary conditions for the wave functions are periodic,\nsince we use an fast Fourier transform \u0001FFT\u0002 method for\nrepresenting the derivatives. The time step was 0.2 fm\/c. As\nseen by the conservation properties above and by the agree-\nment for the incoming phase, this yields sufficient accuracy\nfor the pure solution of the TDHF equations.\nHere we see that for this case Ecm drops by 3 Mev for R\ngoing from 12 to 18 fm. This implies an equivalent uncer-\ntainty in the determination of the final energy, which is per-\nhaps not unaceeptable but certainly annoying.\nThe possibilty that this effect arises from artefacts in the\nCoulomb energy can be excluded. The Poisson equation is\nsolved with the method of \u000335\u0004 using a double-sized grid\nwhich ensures a correct handling of the long-range behavior.\nThe monopole approximation used for the estimate \u000117\u0002 has\nbeen tested by including also the quadrupole interaction en-\nergy, whereby \u000117\u0002 turned out to perform sufficiently precise.\nSince Coulomb can be ruled out, the remaining possibility\nfor explaining the effect is direct interference of the wave\nfunctions with their periodic images, and in this respect the\nemission of free nucleons again would be the prime candi-\ndate, since the bound states should decay sufficiently rapidly.\nThe two additional curves in Fig. 11 show results of tests in\nthis direction: Making the mesh larger by increasing the di-\nmensions to 32\u001132\u001144 \u0001with grid spacing remaining at\n1 fm, curve labeled \u201clarger mesh\u201d\u0002 changes the absolute\nmagnitude of the effect but the continuing drop in Ecm re-\nmains about the same.\nOn the other hand, adding an absorbing boundary \u0001curve\nlabeled \u201cabsorption\u201d\u0002 of 4 cells in each direction reduces the\nvariation in Ecm considerably: It is close to 1 MeV now. It\nappears that the emission of nucleons and their spurious re-\ninterference with the dynamics inside the computational grid\nis a problem for the simulation of heavy-ion collisions as\nwell.\nIn the future a careful balance will have to be chosen\nbetween the need for accuracy in the final c.m. energy and\ncomputational efficiency, since adding an absorbing layer\nmeans a considerable increase in computing time. Further\nstudies concerning the energy and mass dependence are\nclearly required.\nIX. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied two widely used techniques for simulat-\ning absorbing boundary conditions \u0001imaginary potentials and\nmasking functions\u0002 in the time-dependent mean-field ap-\nproach, using as test cases the description of nuclear giant\nresonances and large-amplitude nuclear collective motion as-\nsociated with significant breakup probabilities. Straightfor-\nward calculation in a finite box with the standard reflecting\nboundary conditions yields unwanted echoes in the signal\ndue to nucleon current reflected from the bounds an reap-\npearing at the nuclear site. This can induce unpredictable\nside-effects in large amplitude dynamics. In the analysis of\nthe giant resonance strength function, these echoes artifi-\ncially \u201cquantize\u201d the spectra in accordance with the discrete\nspectrum in a finite simulation box, thus missing the smooth\nspectral distributions as they emerge from the decay width in\nthe particle continuum.\nA conceptually simple, but extremely costly, solution is to\nuse huge boxes such that the echoes do not show up within\nthe observation time \u0001which in turn determines the resolution\nof the computation\u0002. A broad palette of elaborate techniques\nhas been developed to establish continuum solutions in the\nlinear regime \u0001continuum RPA\u0002. We have investigated two of\nthem which are easily applicable also in large-scale and\nlarge-amplitude situations. These are absorbing boundary\nconditions which aim to remove outgoing flow. The two op-\ntions, the absorbing potential and masking function, were\nfound to be about equally effective, and able to reduce ech-\noes by two orders of magnitude for only moderate computa-\ntional cost. It is important that reasonable values of the pa-\nrameters associated with the absorbing potential and masking\nfunction are used to ensure efficient absorption. It is found,\nhowever, that the remaining small echoes still give rise to\nvisible oscillations in the spectra.\nFor computing spectra in the linear regime, a simpler and\nmore direct way of smoothing the spectra is achieved by\nwindowing in the spectral analysis. It was realized by filter-\ning of the given signal in the time domain. That again brings\nup a payoff between resolution and expense. The smoothing\nhas to override the average spectral spacing of the finite box.\nRather large boxes are needed to maintain sufficient sensitiv-\nity in order to see the wanted physical structures in the spec-\ntra. It was found finally that a judiciously chosen mix of\nmoderately absorbing bounds with moderate spectral\nsmoothing provides the most efficient scheme.\nIn the analysis of large amplitude motion for the breathing\nmode, the absorbing bound technique worked very well, and\nthe relevant observables, such as number of emitted nucle-\nons, was rather insensitive to the details of the absorption\nused. It is clear that the computation of spectra in the con-\ntinuum near the emission threshold is probably the most de-\nmanding application for absorbing boundary conditions. As\nlittle as a remaining percent of reflected particles can still\nyield a visible perturbation of the spectra. Other applications,\nfor which the absorbing were designed originally, are much\nmore forgiving. For example, the outgoing flow of emitted\nparticle can be easily computed with a precision of a few\npercent which is fully satisfying for that observable and oth-\ners of similar nature \u0001as, e.g., angular distributions\u0002. How-\never, further applications to resonance spectra call for im-\nprovement of absorbing bounds.\nWhile our work concentrated on applications to breathing\nmode oscillations, our study of nuclear collisions again high-\nREINHARD et al.
