INTRODUCTION\nThe phenomenon of nuclear superdeformation at high\nspins has been studied intensively since 1986 when the first\nsuperdeformed band in the rare-earth nucleus 152Dy has been\nfound [1]. The single-particle orbital-structure of the nuclear\nsuperdeformed states has been relatively simply identified in\n152Dy nucleus and in a few of its direct neighbors for the yrast,\nand for a few low-lying excited bands; for the early evolution\nof the information on the superdeformed nuclei the reader\nis referred to the reviews [2]. It is relatively easy to propose\nthe lowest-energy one-particle\u2013one-hole excitations across the\nbig shell gaps leading to lowest-energy excited bands (see the\ndiscussion below, and in particular the results in Figs. 3 and 4).\nHowever, with increasing excitation there is a large increase in\nthe number of possible particle-hole configurations that differ\nonly little in terms of the p-h excitation energy. Moreover,\nmany of these bands have very similar dynamical momentJ (2)\nvs rotational frequency, \u03c9, over the whole range of the \u03c9-axis\nwhere the corresponding quantities are known experimentally,\nand thus the identification of the corresponding bands turns\nout to be ambiguous.\nOne possible way out of difficulties related to the iden-\ntification of the bands that are increasingly complicated in\ntheir particle-hole structure can be proposed when studying\nthe typical single-particle Routhian structure around the big\nSD gaps. In particular, the SD magic gaps are the largest\nat small rotational frequencies but they close gradually with\nincreasing cranking frequency. It then follows that when\nthe frequencies are sufficiently large, various characteristic\ncrossings among the single-particle Routhians take place that\ncan be used to identify the configurations. However, previous\nexperimental data were often not known sufficiently high in\nspin and the comparison of the experimental band crossings\nwith those characteristic ones predicted by theory was not\npossible.\nIn this paper we present the data on the extended yrast and\nexcited SD bands and also new SD bands in the 151,152Tb\nnuclei. These data have been obtained in a 17-day run\nexperiment at EUROBALL IV, whose primary goal is the\nsearch for discrete linking transitions from the yrast SD\nband to normal deformed (ND) states in 151Tb nucleus [3].\nConsequently, a high statistic data set was obtained. For the\neight SD bands already known in 151Tb, several new transitions\nhave been observed at the highest rotational frequencies and\na precise determination of many \u03b3 -ray energies has been\nobtained. Five new SD bands have been discovered, two of\nthem have been assigned to 151Tb and three to 152Tb.\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(1)\/014308(10) 014308-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nJ. ROBIN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 014308 (2008)\nOwing to the high-quality experimental data, in this work\nwe were able to identify several critical transitions that indicate\nseveral new crossings between the bands and consequently\nhelp to clarify a number of open questions related to the\ninterpretation of those bands in terms of the single-particle\nRouthian structure.\nBelow we present the new experimental results and the\ntheoretical interpretation of the structure of the measured\nrotational SD bands based on the cranking mean-field approach\nwith the deformed Woods-Saxon potential according to its\n\u2018universal\u2019 parametrization, cf. Ref. [4] and references therein.\nThe procedure consists in calculating the J (2)-moments of\nseveral hundred bands at several deformation points from\nthe vicinity of the average SD yrast equilibrium deformation.\nNext, in the process of attributing the theoretically calculated\nbands to the experimental ones, both the similarity of the\ncorresponding J (2) vs rotational frequency \u03c9 curves as well\nas the theoretical excitation energies and the experimental\npopulation intensities are taken into account as discussed\nbelow in detail.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. An overview\nof previous studies on the 151Tb nucleus is given in Sec. II.\nSome details related to the experimental setup are presented in\nSec. III and the results, including some examples of the\nexperimental spectra are presented in Sec. IV (the correspond-\ning Tables of the obtained transition energies are given in\nthe Appendix). The results from calculations results and the\ncomparison with experiment are given in Sec. VI.\nII. 151TB NUCLEUS : AN OVERVIEW\nThe level scheme of 151Tb has been determined to very high\nspins and excitation energies [5]. The theoretical interpretation\nof its decay pattern associated with the normal- (as opposed\nto super)deformation indicates a gradual transition from a\nnearly spherical- to an oblate-shape, the calculated oblate\ndeformation increasing slowly with excitation energy and spin\nfrom \u03b2 \u2248 \u22120.05 up to \u03b2 \u2248 \u22120.20 [5].\nThe corresponding noncollective transitions are slower as\ncompared to the two other groups of transitions seen typically\nin the nuclei in this mass range: the collective rotational\nbands associated with the moderate quadrupole deformation\nbut characterized, according to the calculations, by a relatively\nstrong triaxiality, and the superdeformed transitions.\nThe nucleus 151Tb has been one of the first nuclei in the A \u223c\n150 mass region in which many SD bands involving proton-\nand neutron-holes in the SD gaps Z = 66 and N = 86 have\nbeen observed [6,7]. Moreover the first observation of identical\nsuperdeformed bands was made in this nucleus [8]. In the\nfollowing we concentrate on the SD bands, their properties\nand interpretation.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\nThe terbium isotopes were produced via the 130Te (27Al,\nxn) reaction at the beam energy of 155 MeV. A stack of two\nself-supporting 130Te, each \u223c500 \u00b5g cm\u22122 thick was used\nwith the 27Al beam provided by the Vivitron accelerator of the\nInstitut de Recherches Subatomiques of Strasbourg, France.\nThe \u03b3 -ray decays of the residual nuclei were measured using\nthe Euroball IV array which consisted of 30 tapered detectors\n(forward quadrant), 26 clover detectors (around 90\u25e6), and 15\ncluster detectors (backward angles). Associated to an inner\nball of BGO detectors (210 crystals), they formed a device of\n164 groups of \u2018equivalent\u2019 detectors in terms of solid angle\nand efficiency\u2014allowing us to measure the multiplicity and\nthe sum energy of \u03b3 -rays emitted in a nuclear reaction.\nA coincidence fold selection of at least six unsuppressed\n(four suppressed) Ge detectors and of at least ten BGO ball\nelements firing was required for selecting high-multiplicity\nevents. The relative yields of the main evaporation channels\n5n, 6n, and 7n are 13%, 77%, and 10%, respectively. After\nCompton suppression a total yield of 8.7 \u00d7 109 four-fold and\nhigher-fold events was obtained, leading to a mean multiplicity\nvalue of 5. In the analysis of the data set a nonspiked database\n[9] has been used. The search for new SD bands in Tb isotopes\nwas carried out using an automatic search code [10] which\nrequires three of four gates to be satisfied before identifying\nregular sequences of \u03b3 -ray transitions.\nIV. RESULTS\nIn the present data set, due to the very high statistics and an\nimproved peak-to-background ratio, a total of 15 SD bands has\nbeen observed. Apart from the eight bands previously assigned\nto 151Tb and two SD bands assigned to 152Tb, [11], five new\nSD bands were clearly identified.\nThe search for new SD structures in these Tb nuclei turned\nout to be a delicate task since several factors contributed to\ntechnical and\/or practical difficulties:\n(i) The overall weak population of the SD bands;\n(ii) Competition with low-lying SD bands that are therefore\npopulated with stronger relative intensity;\n(iii) The presence, within one single nucleus, of many SD\nbands with similar J (2) behavior and overlapping over\nlong stretches of rotational frequencies;\n(iv) The presence of some SD bands with no regular behavior\nof their J (2) moments.\nIt then follows that considerable efforts were necessary for\nthe extension of experimental knowledge of well established\nSD bands up to the highest observable frequencies, especially\nin the feeding region close to the fission limit.\nA careful, complementary analysis has been performed\nusing a new background subtraction method [12]. By using\nbackground spectra very representative of those in coincidence\nwith SD bands we succeeded in keeping maximum statistics\nin SD peaks.\nThe \u03b3 -ray transition energies of the ten SD bands, labeled\nfrom 1 to 10 in the 151Tb case, and 1 to 5 in that of 152Tb,\nare listed in Tables III, IV, V, and VI in the Appendix. The\nnew SD bands are labeled 9 and 10 and 1 to 3 in 151Tb and\n152Tb, respectively. The new \u03b3 -ray energies observed in this\nexperiment and also the energies of all the band members\nalready known in 151,152Tb nuclei are included in the tables.\nThe spectra of the new SD bands are displayed in Fig. 1.\nThe highest energy parts of the 151Tb(1\u20138) bands, where the\nnew transitions are clearly seen, are presented in Fig. 2.\n014308-2\nEXTENDED INVESTIGATION OF SUPERDEFORMED BANDS . . .

In particular the triaxiality parameter\n\u03b3 remains close to zero for most of the bands in the nuclei that\nare close neighbors of the SD doubly-magic 152Dy nucleus.\nIn the following calculations, we used the shapes and\nshape evolution for the even-even nuclei as tabulated in\nRef. [13]. A typical average deformation corresponding to the\n152Dy nucleus has been selected for the Routhian diagrams in\nFigs. 3 and 4 that will be used as the reference when discussing\nthe particle-hole excitations analyzed below.\nWe use the usual notation related to the occupation of\nthe special, intruder orbitals, i.e., those characterized by\nN = 6 for the protons and N = 7 for the neutrons. For\ninstance, configuration corresponding to the occupation of\ntwo proton-intruder levels and three neutron-intruder levels\nFIG. 4.

For the detailed reference related to the\nsingle-particle routhians, the Nilsson labels shown in Figs. 3\nand 4 will be used.\nAccording to the so-far unexplained \u2018moment-of-inertia\nanomaly\u2019 discussed in Ref. [14], the J (2) moments calculated\nusing the Woods-Saxon mean-field potential are on the average\n\u223c10% larger than the experimental values (here we address\nthe unambigous conclusions based on the comparison of the\nregular curves, i.e., not the ones possibly \u2018contaminated\u2019 by\nthe band crossings). The self-consistent Hartree-Fock results\nproduce a similar anomaly, with the deviations that are slightly\nsmaller, 7\u20138 %. Since this systematic deviation applies in a\nsimilar fashion to all the bands studied, it has been suggested\n[14] to introduce a reduction factor f = 0.9; the corresponding\ncommon renormalization applied to all the calculated moments\nfacilitates the legibility of comparisons (illustrations) and has\nbeen applied also below.\nA. Proton con\ufb01gurations\nA quadrupole moment of 17.2 eb, [15], has been attributed\nto the 151Tb yrast SD band. This measurement confirms clearly\nthe superdeformed character of the underlying nuclear configu-\nration. According to the accepted interpretation, its structure is\nbased on the \u03c063\u03bd72 configuration in terms of high-N intruder\norbitals. The corresponding explicit Nilsson labels can be read\nfrom Fig. 3: for the protons they are \u03c0 |660 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u00b11\/2, and\n\u03c0 |651 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2. Similarly, the neutron intruder labels can\nbe read from Fig. 4: they are \u03bd|770 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u00b11\/2.\nThe labels 2, 3, and 4 associated with the first three excited\nbands reflect the decreasing relative population intensity.\nThe interpretation of the related configurations accepted by\nseveral authors is that of the lowest-lying proton particle-hole\nexcitations (cf., e.g., [14] and references quoted therein). Here\nthe structures of bands 151Tb(2\u20134) have been reanalyzed taking\ninto account a more complete experimental information.\nThe experimental and theoretical dynamical moments J (2)\nof the SD-bands (1\u20134) are plotted in Fig. 5 as functions of rota-\ntional frequency. As this work has allowed for the identification\nof new \u03b3 -ray transitions at very high frequencies and a higher\nprecision in the measurement of the SD \u03b3 -ray transition-\nenergies with weak intensities, we were able to extract accurate\nvalues of dynamical moments and to observe their behavior\napproaching closer to the fission limit. Modifications in the\nsmooth variation of J (2) at very high \u03c9 should reflect the\ncrossings of the bands predicted by theory. These crossings\nappear at the frequencies corresponding to the closing up\nthe magic gaps at the highest frequency limit as discussed\nabove. Observation of such effects in the experiment imposes\nnew constraints on the possible particle-hole configurations\nunderlying the description of those SD bands.\nBand 151Tb(1). The experimental results for the yrast band,\n151Tb(1), indicate that the J (2) moments show a regular\ndecrease with frequency up to the highest observed values\nof h\u00af\u03c9 \u223c 0.8 MeV with, nevertheless, some fluctuations at\nthe end of the band. The theoretical results for J (2) mo-\nments based on the \u03c063\u03bd72 intruder configuration indicate a\nstrong discontinuity at a very high rotational frequency (h\u00af\u03c9\n\u223c 0.80 MeV) caused by the interaction between the\nRotational Frequency\nBand 1 Band 2\nBand 3 Band 4\nD\nyn\nam\nic\nal\n M\nom\nen\nts\nFIG. 5.

Unfortunately, no higher frequencies than h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.8\nMeV have been observed, suggesting either a possible close-\nness of the fission limit or that the strong crossing of the bands\ndoes indeed take place at the predicted frequency in which case\nan extra loss of population intensity could be expected. This is\nbecause in such a case the closeness of the two crossing bands\nimplies a competition in terms of a given feeding flux that is\nin such a case split into two, with half the intensity each.\nBand 151Tb(2). The measured intensity of the first excited\nSD band, 151Tb(2), relative to the yrast band is \u224829(3)%. This\nstrongly suggests that at the high spin window where this band\nis populated it corresponds most likely to the second excited\nRouthian. From inspection of Figs. 3 and 4 it follows that\nthere are several possible candidate-configurations possible.\nIn Ref. [14] it has been proposed that the underlying structure\ncorresponds to the \u03c0 |301 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 proton hole in the yrast\nSD band of 152Dy. In that case, according to Fig. 3 no\nmanifestation of the crossing between the above mentioned\norbitals \u03c0 |301 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 and \u03c0 |770 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 is expected.\nBand 151Tb(3). This band is populated with a relative\nintensity of 24(2)%, a value very close to the one for band\n151Tb(2). This similarity suggests that the two bands could\nbe signature partners, provided that the underlying single-\nparticle Routhian-partners do not manifest any dramatic\nsignature splitting.

However, the new data allow\nextending the observed frequency range for band 151Tb(4)\nand therefore to identify the well pronounced down-sloping\nin J (2) moment, at low and high rotational frequencies,\nwhich was not reproduced with previous calculations. Taking\ninto account that the intensity of band 4 is about half the\none of band 2, a new configuration assignment is proposed\nbased on the excitation of the \u03c0 |301 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 orbital\ninto the \u03c0 |651 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 one and the excitation of the\n\u03bd |411 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 orbital into the \u03bd |761 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 one. The\ncharacteristic down-sloping of the theoretical J (2) moments\nwith increasing frequency, at h\u00af\u03c9 \u223c 0.75 MeV is caused by\nthe crossing of the neutron orbitals \u03bd |761 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 and\n\u03bd |521 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2. Similarly, the strong down-sloping of dy-\nnamical moments with decreasing frequency is caused by the\nemptied down-bending \u03bd |411 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 neutron orbital [for\ndetails of the configurations cf. Table I]. Another interpretation\nis also proposed below when discussing band 6 configuration.\nB. Neutron con\ufb01gurations\nThe experimental results for bands 151Tb(5\u20138) indicating a\nstrong correlation with the yrast sequence of the isotope 150Tb\nhave been related to neutron particle-hole excitations [14]. The\nprevious calculations indicate that several neutron particle-\nhole excitations give a very similar dependence of the dynam-\nical moments as function of rotational frequency. These are\nexcitations from the \u03bd |770 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 orbital to either of the\n\u03bd |402 5\/2\u3009, \u03bd |521 3\/2\u3009 or \u03bd |514 9\/2\u3009 orbitals. Therefore only\nthe more likely explanations have been proposed (cf. Table I).\nBands 151Tb(5,6). The intensities of bands 5 and 6 relative\nto the yrast SD band are 13(3)% and 14(3)%, respectively.\nConcerning the J (2) moments of the 151Tb(5,6) signature\npartner bands their previously observed degeneracy ceases\nat very high frequencies as a strongly marked upbend alters\nthe smooth behavior of J (2) for one component (Fig. 6).\nCalculations based on an excitation from the \u03bd |770 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2\norbital to the \u03bd |402 5\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u00b11\/2 orbital and for deformation\nparameters \u03b22 = 0.59, \u03b24 = 0.11 agree comparably well with\nthe experimental data for bands 5 and 6 (Fig. 6). Band 5\ncorresponds to a neutron excitation from the \u03bd |770 1\/2\u3009 state\nto the the \u03bd |402 5\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 orbital while band 6 involves the\nsignature partner of the last orbital. This component interacts\nstrongly with the \u03bd |633 7\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2 and \u03bd |642 3\/2\u3009\u03b1=\u22121\/2\norbitals at frequencies h\u00af\u03c9\u0001 0.75 MeV. Thus, those new data\nhave allowed us to fix (in the frame of these calculations) the\nconfigurations associated to bands 151Tb(5, 6).\nThe case of band 4 with two down-bending J (2) structures\nat low (h\u00af\u03c9 \u223c 0.4 MeV) and high (h\u00af\u03c9 \u223c 0.7 MeV) frequencies\ncan be related to the two up-bending J (2) structures (the\nlowest being expected and the highest clearly seen) of band\n6. This may reflect an accidental degeneracy in excitation\nenergy, supported by the fact that those two bands have similar\nintensities leading to similar excitation energy. Moreover,\nmaking the assumption that those two bands interact at a\nspin of 63.5h\u00af (based on the calculations made in Ref. [16]),\ntheir different J (2) behavior means that they also interact\nagain at the spin 31.5h\u00af, which is in good agreement with the\nRotational Frequency\nBand 5 Band 6\nBand 7 Band 8\nBand 9 Band 10\nD\nyn\nam\nic\nal\n M\nom\nen\nts\nFIG. 6.

Unfortunately, the two\npossible crossings occur at the very bottom and top of both\nbands hindering the chance to see any transitions of band 6 in\nband 4 spectrum, and vice versa. In addition, the interband\ntransitions for the high frequency crossing would be very\nweak as they are located in the SD bands feeding region.\nAt low frequency these lines are drowned in the spectrum\nby a high density of intense normal-deformed transitions.\nIn conclusion with the present statistics, there is no way to\nconfirm experimentally the hypothesis of a double SD band\ncrossing between bands 4 and 6.\nBands 151Tb(7,8).

They are characterized by a J (2) moment\n(Fig. 6) similar to those of bands having the \u03c063\u03bd71\nhigh-N intruder configurations: 149Gd(3), 150Tb(1), 151Tb(5,\n6, 7, 8). The \u03b3 -ray transition energies of 151Tb(9, 10)\nbands resemble those of a signature-partner pair. The cor-\nresponding similarity is remarkably well maintained over\nthe full observed frequency range. The similarity between\nthe J (2) moments in 150Tb(1) and in 151Tb(9, 10) suggest\nthat the intruder neutron Routhian \u03bd |770 1\/2\u3009\u03b1=+1\/2 is not\noccupied in the related configurations and that the corre-\nsponding neutron particle-hole excitation involves a low-\nlying orbital with a small J (2) contribution.

In contrast to\nalready known 152Tb(4,5) bands with J (2) moments having\na regular behavior, the J (2) moments of 152Tb(1, 2, 3) bands\ndisplay significant irregularities and therefore comparison with\nthe similar possibly existing in the literature J (2) forms of\nbehavior was not easy.\nBand 152Tb(1). In this analysis the \u03c063\u03bd73 high-N intruder\nconfiguration has been assigned to 152Tb(1) as the most\nprobable one and we propose it as the yrast SD band in 152Tb.\nTo reinforce this statement, the band 152Tb(1) has actually\nthe highest intensity of all bands found in this nucleus. The\ncomparison between theoretical results and experimental ones\nfor 152Tb(1, 2, 3) bands is illustrated in Fig. 8.\nBand 152Tb(2). The \u03b3 -ray energies of 152Tb(2) band are\nvery close to the energies of the 152Dy(2) band over a\nlarge part of the observed energy range. Their J (2) moments\nshow the same steeply uprising slope below h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.55 MeV\n(Fig. 7). Above this frequency, all the bands in question\n[152Tb(2), 152Dy(2), and 150Tb(3)] manifest the slope similar\nto that of 151Tb(1). The J (2) moment of 150Tb(3) presents\nsimilar features, especially a pronounced increase in J (2)\nbelow h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.50 MeV.\nIn Ref. [20] the \u03c064\u03c071(|301 1\/2\u3009)\u22121\u03bd72 configuration has\nbeen assigned to 152Dy(2) as the most likely interpretation. The\nincrease inJ (2) below h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.5 MeV has been attributed to the\ncrossing between the \u03c0 |770 1\/2\u3009 and \u03c0 |330 1\/2\u3009 orbitals. For\nthe 150Tb(3) band the \u03c063\u03bd72 high-N intruder configuration\nhas been proposed, coupled to a hole in either the |654 5\/2\u3009\nor |651 1\/2\u3009 neutron orbitals [17].

CONCLUSIONS\nAn extensive study of SD bands in 151,152Tb isotopes has\nbeen performed, allowing the for a reinterpretation of nucle-\nonic configuration assignments on the basis of comparison\nbetween experimental results and universal-parametrization\nWoods-Saxon mean-field calculations. Five new SD bands\nhave been discovered, raising the number of known bands\nto ten and five, in 151Tb and 152Tb isotopes, respectively.\nAmong those, two bands [151Tb(4) and 152Tb(2)] have been\ninterpreted as a two particle-hole excitations (one neutron plus\none proton) in order to reproduce their dynamical moments of\ninertia.\nIn the present experiment the experimental data were\nobtained during the 17 day run with the EUROBALL IV\narray. The obtained high quality spectra allowed to find the\ntransitions whose presence made it possible to eliminate a\nnumber of competing single-nucleonic configurations and at\nthe same time propose nearly unambiguous interpretation in\nterms of the others. Our experiment shows clearly that the\nhigh-precision experimental data are crucial for determining\nthe underlying single-particle structure and cross-testing the\nmicroscopic nuclear high-spin theories in an efficient way.\nThis is because the numerous crossings among the single-\nparticle Routhians that appear at the very high frequency limit\nwhere the superdeformed magic gaps finally close, offer a\n(complicated but often unique and powerful) scheme of up- and\nor down-bending structures that distinguish clearly among the\nnumerous bands whose dynamical moments otherwise behave\nin a very regular manner.\nThe results obtained here indicate that the most powerful\npresent day detection arrays are at the limit of the detection\ncapacities needed to perform the conclusive nuclear high-spin\nstructure determination. It becomes clear that with an increase\nof the detection efficiency by about a factor of 4 (cf. AGATA\nand GRETA), a few days running time experiments of the type\nperformed here will become of extreme importance in the\nfuture with the beam-time limitations becoming prohibitively\nscarce.\nAPPENDIX\nIn this appendix we have summarized the experimental\nresults obtained so far on the superdeformed bands in 151,152Tb\nnuclei.
