Toward the end of the simulation, at 600 Myr, the dis-\nplaced gas begins to fall back toward the core, and the subsequent turbulence is very\nefficient at mixing the low and high entropy gas. The result is that the cooling flow\nis disrupted for up to \u223c 50 Myr after the injection of energy ceases.

As the gas in the centre of the cluster\nradiates its internal energy, the pressure support in the outer\nparts is reduced and a flow is established. In cluster centres,\nthe cooling time is short compared to the age of the clus-\nter, which makes this an important mechanism for accreting\ngas onto a central object. The astrophysical puzzle is to un-\nderstand how the high flow rates that have been estimated\nfor some clusters (up to 2000 M\u2299 per year, e.g. Allen 2000)\ncan be compatible with the relatively small masses of cold\ngas and young stars seen in central cluster objects (Craw-\nford et al. 1995; Edge et al. 1999; Wilman et al. 2000), or\nwith the lack of gas seen at temperatures below about 2 keV\n(eg., Peterson et al. 2001; Tamura et al., 2001; Oegerle et al.\n2001).\nIn smaller mass haloes, cooling flows are expected to be\nthe mechanism by which individual galaxies form. However,\na similar problem to that observed in clusters exists, in that\nthe short cooling times imply that a large fraction of the to-\ntal baryonic mass should have been able to cool in a Hubble\ntime. This is in conflict with observations which show that\nonly a small fraction of baryons are now in this cold form\n(Fukugita et al. 1998; Balogh et al. 2001).\nA popular solution to these problems is the suggestion\nthat gas cooling might trigger heating processes (feedback)\nwhich regulate the cooling flow (eg., White & Frenk 1991).\nFor example, cooling gas is likely to lead to star forma-\ntion, which returns energy to the intracluster medium (ICM)\nvia supernovae and stellar winds; also, cooling gas accreted\nonto black holes might fuel highly energetic, relativistic jets.\nThese processes might either reheat the gas from the cold\nphase, or reduce the cooling rate, therefore limiting the frac-\ntion of baryons which can cool; this can have important con-\nsequences for the evolution of clusters and the formation of\ngalaxies (eg., Ponman, Cannon & Navarro 1999; Valageas &\nSilk 1999; Bower et al. 2001).\nAlthough there are many physical processes known\nwhich may be viable sources of feedback energy, it is un-\nknown exactly how such injections of energy interact with\nthe surrounding gas. In particular, there are three possible\noutcomes of an energy injection event: (1) the energy may\nserve to increase the total emissivity of the gas (for example,\nby compressing surrounding material), resulting in all of the\ninput energy radiating away; (2) the energy may be concen-\ntrated in a small amount of gas that then escapes from the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 Quilis et al.\ncluster core but has little effect on the cooling flow; (3) the\ninjected energy may disrupt the cooling flow, either tem-\nporarily or permanently. Only in the third instance is the\nmechanism going to be effective at solving the problems de-\nscribed above; the focus of this work is to determine what\nhappens to energy injected in clusters with substantial cool-\ning flows.\nAdvances in computing power have recently made de-\ntailed simulations of feedback viable, and there has conse-\nquently been a lot of work studying the phenomenon with\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Kritsuk et al.\n(2001) studied the effect of supernova injecta on cooling\nflows on galactic scales, and showed that overlapping su-\npernovae within the galaxy created a turbulent convection\nzone that effectively mixed gas in the inner regions, reduc-\ning the entropy profile and the central cooling rate. Chu-\nrazov et al. (2001) consider the specific case of the galaxy\nM31, and study in detail the dynamics of buoyant bubbles\nwithin a model galaxy, and their influence on the surround-\ning medium. However, their simulations do not include ra-\ndiative cooling, and are therefore unable to address the abil-\nity of such bubbles to influence the cooling rate. Reynolds,\nHeinz & Begelman (2001) investigated the behaviour of su-\npersonic energy sources in cooling flow clusters, concentrat-\ning on the interaction of radio jets with the intra-cluster\nmedium.\nAll of the recent simulations discussed above find that\nenergy injection results in buoyant bubbles which displace\nand disturb the surrounding gas. In this paper, our purpose\nis to investigate in detail the effect that energy injection into\nthe ICM has on the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. We\npresent the first fully three-dimensional simulations which\ninclude radiative cooling and sporadic energy injection on\ncluster scales. The three dimensional nature of the simula-\ntions is essential to ensure that realistic convective flows are\nestablished, and turbulent mixing of the multiphase gas is\nproperly modelled. In \u00a72 we present the details of the numer-\nical model, and our method for simulating energy injection.\nThe results of two simulations, one with and one without\nenergy injection, are presented in \u00a73. A quantitative analy-\nsis of the results, and qualitative comparison with Chandra\nobservations are presented in \u00a74. Our conclusions are sum-\nmarized in \u00a75.\n2 SIMULATIONS\n2.1 Numerical Code\nWe use the three dimensional Eulerian fixed-grid hydrody-\nnamical code described in Quilis et al. (1996). The code uses\nmodern high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) techniques,\nwhich are specially designed to integrate hyperbolic systems\nof equations as the hydrodynamic equations. The HRSC\ntechniques have important advantages over some other tech-\nniques. The practical implementation of the code has four\nkey ingredients: i) conservative formulation; that is, numer-\nical quantities are conserved up to the numerical order of\nthe method, ii) the reconstruction procedure, which allows\nto recover the distribution of the quantities inside the com-\nputational cells, iii) the Riemann solver, which solves the\nevolution of discontinuities at cell interfaces, and iv) the\ntime advancement, which is designed to be consistent with\nthe conservation properties. The main advantage of HRSC\ncodes is the use of Riemann solvers to compute the numerical\nviscosity needed to solve the hydro equations. This numeri-\ncal viscosity is given internally by the method and does not\nrequire any guess at the form of the viscosity (the so called\n\u201cartificial viscosity\u201d required by other methods). The nu-\nmerical viscosity given by Riemann solver based methods is\nsmall and therefore these methods can resolve strong shocks\nextremely well (typically in one or two cells) as the diffu-\nsion is reduced dramatically compared with methods based\non other prescriptions for the numerical viscosity. Other im-\nportant advantages of HRSC techniques are that they work\nvery well in low density regions, and they are of high-order\nin smooth regions of the flow.\nThe nature of the feedback process presents important\nchallenges to the numerical code. Specifically, the sporadic\ninjection of large amounts of energy in a very small vol-\nume could produce shocks and large jumps in the hydrody-\nnamical quantities which must be accurately resolved. Large\njumps in density are also produced by turbulent mixing and\nradiative cooling, as well as the propagation of the bubble\nwhich generates sound waves. Our hydrodynamical code was\nspecially designed for an accurate treatment of fluid dynam-\nical processes and is extremely good in dealing with shocks,\nstrong discontinuities, turbulent regions, and low density\nregimes. Therefore, it is a good tool to tackle the problem\naddressed in this paper.\nThe system of hydrodynamic equations needs a equa-\ntion of state in order to be closed. We adopt the equation\nof state for an ideal gas, p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03c1\u01eb, where p is the pres-\nsure, \u03b3 the adiabatic exponent, \u03c1 the density, and \u01eb the\nspecific internal energy. Considering the range of temper-\natures and densities of the ICM, we model the ICM gas as a\nnon-relativistic monatomic fluid with \u03b3 = 5\/3. Although\nthis assumption is reasonable \u2013 especially at the resolu-\ntion of our simulations \u2013 it neglects the role of magnetic\nfields which might lead to more long-lived bubbles (Fabian\net al. 2001). Magnetohydrodynamic interactions cannot be\naddressed with our present code.\n2.2 Initial Conditions\nWe run two simulations of a 1015M\u2299 cluster, using a grid of\n2563 cells in a cube 1 Mpc per side, corresponding to a cell\nsize of 3.9kpc. The simulations are carried out on an Origin\n2000 parallel computer, and follow the cluster evolution over\na simulated time of 900 Myr. We assume a Hubble constant\nof H\u25e6 = 70 km s\n\u22121.\nThe initial cluster profile is constructed assuming that\nisothermal gas sits in a 1015M\u2299 dark matter potential well\nin pressure-supported hydrostatic equilibrium. For the dark\nmatter potential we assume the modified-NFW profile found\nin high resolution simulations (Moore et al. 1998; Lewis\net al. 2000). The virial radius, 2.55 Mpc, is computed using\nthe formalism described in Babul et al. (2001), assuming\na cosmology with \u2126\u25e6 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7, and H\u25e6 = 70 km\ns\u22121. We assume a concentration parameter c = 4, which\nimplies that the \u201ccore\u201d of the potential is 25% of the virial\nradius, or 640kpc. The gas temperature is set to the virial\ntemperature of the halo, kT = 4.75 keV. We assume that\nthe mass fraction of gas within the virial radius is given by\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nBubbles, Feedback and the ICM 3\n\u2126b\/\u2126\u25e6, where \u2126b = 0.039 is the universal baryon density,\nas determined from deuterium abundances by Burles, Nol-\nlett & Turner (2001). The bolometric X-ray luminosity of\nthis model cluster is 4.9 \u00d7 1044 ergs s\u22121, where the emis-\nsivity is computed using the model of Raymond, Cox &\nSmith (1976). Model clusters based on these assumptions\nagree quite well with observed scaling relations of dynam-\nical and X-ray properties of massive clusters, though they\nare less suitable in low mass systems (Babul et al. 2001).\nIn order to break the spherical symmetry of this model, we\nintroduce randomly 10% fluctuations in the gas density.\nThe boundary conditions are treated with an in-\nflow\/outflow condition. Practically, this means that the val-\nues at the boundary cells are determined by copying the\nvalues of their inner neighbours. Our results are insensitive\nto the boundary conditions, however, because the energy\ninjection event occurs far from any boundary, and the simu-\nlation is not run long enough for effects at the edge to be felt\nin the centre. We have verified that other reasonable choices\nof boundary conditions do not have significant effects on our\nconclusions.\n2.3 Energy injection\nWe choose to inject a quantity of energy in a region which is\ndisplaced from the cluster centre; this choice is conservative\nin the sense that it is less likely to be successful at disrupting\nthe cooling flow than if we had deliberately targeted the\nheating on the lowest entropy gas. This will ensure that we\ndistinguish between scenarios (2) and (3) discussed in the\nintroduction: will a bubble of energetic gas not centred on\nthe cooling flow have any influence on that flow?\nOur model is not intended to investigate the interaction\nof the AGN jet with the surrounding material (Reynolds\net al. 2001), so we simply model the heating process by in-\njecting energy centered on a cell which is displaced 8 cells\n(31kpc) from the cluster center. The heating is distributed\nover the surrounding pixels using a spherical (SPH-like) ker-\nnel with smoothing length 8 cells. The heating rate was cho-\nsen to be of the same order as the cooling rate of the cluster:\n4.9 \u00d7 1044ergs s\u22121; this is expected to be typical of the en-\nergy injection from radio jets (e.g. Owen, Eilek & Kassim\n2000). Heating at a much larger rate results in an explo-\nsive detonation with much of the energy being radiated in a\ndense shell (Reynolds et al. 2001); at a lower rate the heat\ninput is unlikely to affect the cluster cooling flow.\nThe heat input is continued for 50 Myr, by which time\na near empty bubble has been formed in the ICM. It is then\nswitched off so that the energy can be distributed around the\ncluster. This is motivated by the desire to model a scenario\nin which the AGN (or other feedback source) is \u201cwoken-up\u201d\nby gas deposited in the cooling flow. This disrupts the flow\nwhich turns off the supply of fresh material and hence limits\nits lifetime.\n2.4 Integrated quantities from two dimensional\nslices\nThe simulations shown in this paper are fully 3D. Although\nwe seed the initial conditions with random fluctuations and\nthe source of energy is located off-centre, the results of our\nsimulation show a high axial symmetry in their gross details.\nFigure 1. The relative error in the X-ray luminosity, LX \u2013 when\ncomputed from two dimensional slices assuming the axisymme-\ntry approximation \u2013 as a function of time. The three lines show\nthe results for three orthogonal two dimensional slices extracted\nfrom the full three dimensional data set. The relative errors are\ncomputed with respect to the LX luminosity computed using the\nwhole 3D data box, for five different outputs.\nThis degree of symmetry has beneficial consequences\non the amount of computational resources needed, as we\ncan compute integrated quantities such as entropy, mass or\nluminosity from 2D slices, avoiding the need to store huge\n3D outputs. Consequently, a better tracking of the time evo-\nlution of these quantities is also possible as a larger number\nof outputs can be saved.\nThe axisymmetric approximation necessarily introduces\nsome error when computing integrated quantities from the\n2D slices instead of from the full 3D data set. In order to\nquantify this, and to justify the validity of the approxima-\ntion, we have computed the relative error of the X-ray lumi-\nnosity computed from three orthogonal 2D slices \u2013 extracted\nfrom the 3D full data \u2013 assuming axial symmetry, with re-\nspect to the X-ray luminosity computed from the whole 3D\nbox. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the relative error as a\nfunction of time for 5 outputs where we have the full 3D out-\nput. In any case errors are larger than 6%. Other quantities,\nsuch as density, show even smaller errors. The axisymmetry\nof the problem does not obviate the use of 3D simulations\nas mixing processes at the gas interface, for example, may\nbe more correctly modelled, though still symmetric.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Cooling Simulation\nThe first simulation that we run includes radiative cooling,\nbut without any extra energy input. The flow quickly be-\ncomes established (at 50 Myr) and continues at a steady\nrate for the duration of the simulation. The cluster collapses\nslowly as the energy is radiated (see Figure 3); as matter\nflows into the central region, its luminosity increases, and\nthe mass-weighted mean entropy falls. These effects, includ-\ning the steepening density profile of the cluster core, have\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 Quilis et al.\nFigure 2.

We display the evolution of the\ngas properties in a two-dimensional slice in Figure 2. The\ntop three rows show the gas density contrast, temperature\nand entropy, at 4 different times.

In effect, the bubble is generated by a sub-\nsonic wave expanding into the cooling ICM (a sonic boom\nin the terminology of Reynolds et al. 2001). In the simula-\ntion, the energy injection is sufficiently weak that the bubble\nexpands subsonically, pushing gas out of the cluster centre.\nSince this gas is moving adiabatically from a high pressure\nregion to one of lower pressure, it expands and cools. This\nresults in a shell of gas around the bubble which is cooler\nthan the surrounding material. As we elaborate upon in \u00a74.2,\nthis is qualitatively similar to Chandra observations in some\nclusters (e.g. Fabian et al. 2000, 2001). Unlike the simula-\ntions of Reynolds et al. (2001), the cold shell is not due to\nthe displacement of already cold gas, although the result is\nsimilar.\nOnce the heat source is turned off (at 50 Myrs), the bub-\nble ceases to expand, but does not collapse. The buoyancy of\nthe bubble compared to the surrounding material takes over\nas the dominant force, pushing it outward from the centre\nof the simulation. This causes the bubble to adopt a cap-like\ngeometry; roughly a semi-spherical shell of gas with a low\ndensity, low pressure interior. This is similar to the geom-\netry found in the simulations of Churazov et al. (2001); in\ntheir case, the force of the rising material behind the bub-\nble is strong enough to punch through and cause the shell to\nbecome a torus. The surface of the shell in our simulation ex-\nperiences turbulent mixing with the surroundings. The shell\nrises until its entropy becomes comparable to the surround-\ning medium, at which point it dissolves into the surrounding\nICM. This occurs well within the core region of the cluster\n(< 250kpc).\nIn order to better illustrate the effect of the bubble on\nthe entropy distribution of the cluster, we have taken a slice\nthrough the cluster showing the difference between the en-\ntropy of the \u2018feedback\u2019 simulations and the \u2018cooling\u2019 simula-\ntions. This is shown in the fourth row (d) of Figure 2; these\nplots show the effect of the bubble more clearly by subtract-\ning away the entropy gradient in the initial profile and the\nentropy decrease due to cooling. The initial, localised en-\ntropy increase resulting from the energy injection is clearly\nseen in the first panel. Subsequently, the entropy difference\nof the bubble becomes less apparent: as it rises, the sur-\nrounding gas has higher entropy and the contrast of the\nbubble declines. Eventually, the heated material reaches a\npoint at which it mixes with the surrounding material and\ndisappears.\nAs a result of the low pressure region created behind the\nbubble as it rises, a plume of low entropy material (darker\nblue colour) is drawn out of the core (see also Churazov et\nal. 2001). This gas, although not heated directly, becomes\nmixed into the higher entropy gas surrounding the cluster,\nslightly depressing the entropy on scales of 50\u2013100kpc. But\nthe entropy of the very central gas (within 10kpc) is higher\nin the feedback simulation, relative to the cooling-only sim-\nulation. This is because, in the cooling-only simulation, the\ndense core gas has radiated its energy and dropped in en-\ntropy; this cooling has been prevented in the simulation with\nfeedback, resulting in a relatively higher core entropy.\nThe core is significantly disturbed by the rising of the\nbubble, and turbulent mixing of gas in this region becomes\nefficient. To demonstrate the efficiency of mixing, we show\nthe vorticity of the gas in the bottom panel (e) of Figure 2.\nDuring the initial formation of the bubble, the vorticity is\nlow, and largely due to the density fluctuations in the ini-\ntial conditions. As the bubble rises, mixing occurs predomi-\nnantly at the edge of the shell. By the end of the simulation,\nsome of the gas drawn out by the bubble has begun to fall\nback onto the cluster centre, dragging with it higher entropy\nmaterial from the outer regions into the now-turbulent core.\nThe cluster centre is then a region of high vorticity, and plays\nan important role in mixing the high and low entropy gas in\nan irreversible process, thus generating a net increase in the\nentropy of the cluster core. It is also at this time that cool-\ning in the central regions, which had been disturbed by the\ninitial expansion of the bubble, once again becomes strongly\nestablished.\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 Numerical Analysis\nIn this section we look at the evolution in the integrated\nproperties of the model cluster. We focus on a sphere cen-\ntered on the cluster that encloses all of the bubble material\nat 500 Myr (corresponding to a radius of 200 kpc). Figure 3\nshows the evolution of this enclosed mass, the mass-weighted\nentropy and the luminosity of the system. These quantities\nare computed from the two dimensional slices shown in Fig-\nure 2, using the approximation of axisymmetry, because of\nthe limited number of large, fully-three dimensional outputs\n(see \u00a72.4).\nThe mass enclosed within the boundary evolves simi-\nlarly in the two simulations, increasing by about 10% due to\nthe infall of gas as the densest core gas radiates its energy.\nAt late times in the simulation with heating, a small amount\nof mass , 1.4 \u00d7 1010M\u2299, is pushed out of the region by the\nrising plume of gas.\nConcentrating on the mass-weighted mean entropy of\nthe system, the initial effect of the heat injection can be\nclearly seen. This small rise in entropy is not sufficient to\nprevent the cooling of the core, which subsequently contin-\nues at a rate similar to that in the cooling only simulation.\nThe primary effect of the bubble is therefore to delay the en-\ntropy evolution of the the system. At the end of the heated\nsimulation, the average entropy is the same as that of the\nunheated model 100 Myrs earlier.\nWe set out to distinguish between three possible fates of\nthe injected energy: 1) the energy is quickly radiated away,\nresulting in an increase in X-ray luminosity; 2) the bubble\nescapes from the cluster core without affecting the cluster\ncore, in which case the rate of energy radiation is unchanged;\nor 3) the heating event disrupts the cooling flow, reducing\nthe X-ray luminosity. The dominant effect in our simulations\nis scenario 3): the injected energy temporarily disrupts the\ncooling flow, but is not immediately radiated away, nor does\nit escape the cluster core. In the cooling-only run, a total\n9.2 \u00d7 1060 ergs have been radiated by the end of the simu-\nlation, compared with only 8.8 \u00d7 1060 ergs in the run with\nenergy injection. The difference is 3.46 \u00d7 1059 ergs. This is\n55% of the total energy injected. The total energy of the\ncluster differs between the two simulations by 1.55 times\nthe total energy injected.\nSince the cooling flow is re-established about 50 Myr\nafter the heating source is shut off, this mechanism can only\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 Quilis et al.\nFigure 3.

Observa-\ntions show that about 40 per cent of central cluster galaxies\nshow strong line emission, indicative of either star formation\nor nuclear activity, which could potentially heat the sur-\nrounding gas (Johnstone et al. 1987; Heckman et al. 1989;\nMcNamara & O\u2019Connell 1993; Crawford et al. 1999). This\nsuggests that a duty cycle of 1:1 for the heating events is\nnot unreasonable. In our cluster model, if such 50 Myr heat-\ning periods were initiated every 100 Myr, a total energy\nof 6.28\u00d71070 keV would be injected into the cluster within\na Hubble time (13 Gyr). This corresponds to 0.9 keV per\nbaryonic particle within the virialized radius, which com-\npares well with the energy required to explain the slope of\nthe observed X-ray luminosity-temperature correlation (Wu\net al. 1998; Ponman et al. 1999; Balogh et al. 1999).\n4.2 X-ray Observations\nRecent Chandra observations have provided empirical evi-\ndence for bubbles in the ICM (Fabian et al. 2000; McNa-\nmara et al. 2000). In Figure 4 we show the projected X-\nray emissivity of the heated cluster simulation as a time\nsequence from 258 to 933 Myr. The intensity of the image\nreflects the surface brightness across the cluster as it would\nappear in soft energy X-rays, and is created by projecting\nthe X-ray emissivity through the volume of the simulation.\nThe colour the illustrates the luminosity weighted tempera-\nture in each region.\nAt 258 Myr, a warm, low emissivity bubble is just vis-\nible. The low contrast of the bubble reflects the large con-\ntribution to the emissivity made by the gas in front of and\nbehind the bubble. At this time, our simulation already has\na steeply rising density profile towards the centre, so the\ncentral regions are saturated in this image.\nAs the bubble becomes thinner and more shell-like, it\nbecomes better defined in the X-ray image (eg., the central\npanels show 395 and 541 Myr). The material surrounding\nthe bubble has similar temperature to the undisturbed clus-\nter gas, so that shell surrounding the bubble cannot be seen\ndirectly. This is in good qualitative agreement with the ob-\nservations of (Fabian et al. 2000). Because of the high gas\ndensity in the core of our simulation, the plume of material\nthat is drawn out of the core is easily visible as a distortion\nof the symmetry of the X-ray distribution.\nThe final panel shows the cluster at a late time (933\nMyr). At this time, the bubble is no longer visible, having\ndissipated into the surrounding ICM. The disturbance of\nthe cluster remains visible as a plume of cooler gas. Despite\nthe sharp contrast in density, this material is in pressure\nequilibrium with its surroundings. Sharp features such as\nthis are reminiscent of the surface brightness discontinuities\nseen in the cores of some clusters, for example A2142\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented results from the first fully three dimen-\nsional simulations of feedback in a cluster model, including\nthe effects of radiative cooling. The heating model has been\nsuccessful at regulating the cooling of the ICM. We have\nseen that the energy injected is not immediately radiated\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nBubbles, Feedback and the ICM 7\nFigure 4. Mock X-ray images of a cluster generated from our simulation. A sequence of output times from 258 Myr to 933 Myr are\nshown. The intensity of the image shows the X-ray surface brightness of the material in the cluster core, while the colour of the image\nindicates the luminosity weighted temperature of the emission. The temperature scale according to the color palette is red (0.5-2 KeV),\ngreen (2-6 Kev), and blue (6-10 keV). The panels are labelled with the output time. The intensity has been scaled to emphasise the\nappearance and visibility of the bubble; the same scaling is used for all of the panels. The images show an region that is 120kpc on a\nside.\nand that, although only a small amount of gas is involved\nin the formation of the bubble, its effect is felt throughout\nthe cluster core. The aim of these simulations has been to\nquantify the effectiveness of this form of energy injection,\nand we summarize our findings as follows:\n(1) The effect of the delay to the cooling lasts \u223c 50\nMyr after the initial energy injection event finishes, i.e., an\namount of time equivalent to the time over which energy\nwas supplied. Therefore, a 1:1 duty cycle of heating events\nwould be very effective in regulating the radiative cooling\nprocess.\n(2) There is still a net radiation of energy in both sim-\nulations. Measuring energy relative to the cooling-only sim-\nulation shows that the cooling flow has been disrupted, and\nthe injected energy has been efficiently mixed into the sur-\nrounding ICM: the radiated energy never exceeds the energy\nradiated in the \u201cno feedback\u201d case, and none of the heated\nbubble material is convected out of the cluster. Although\nour simulations have not directly reduced the flow rate over\ntimescales of \u223c 500 Myr, the efficiency and timescale over\nwhich the cooling flow is disrupted makes it seem likely that\nmultiple events will be very effective at regulating the cool-\ning rate.\nThree dimensional simulations are an essential compo-\nnent of the present model, despite the axisymmetry of these\nresults. In particular, the modelling of turbulence, which is\ncrucial to the mixing of high and low entropy gas, could not\nbe properly described by a two dimensional code. A more\ndetailed description of the host cluster may also have im-\nportant consequences on this model. For example, modelling\nthe expected mass substructure, distributed asymetrically in\nsmall orbiting lumps, may increase the efficency of energy\nmixing by helping to destroy the pressure-confined bubble.\nAccurate modelling of the these processes will requires three\ndimensional simulations such as the one we have presented\nhere.\nThe next step in this work is to simulate multiple en-\nergy events over cosmological timescales, with a full hierar-\nchical merger-history. It will also be interesting to see if this\nmechanism is equally effective on galaxy scales, and thus\nable to limit the fraction of baryons which cool globally to a\nnumber which is in agreement with the tight observational\nconstraints (Balogh et al. 2001).\nAcknowledgments.
