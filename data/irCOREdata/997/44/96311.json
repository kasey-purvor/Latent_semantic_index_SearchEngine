While in a preference ag-\ngregation problem constraints are modelled by restricting the set of feasible alterna-\ntives, this paper addresses the modelling of constraints when aggregating individual\nyes\/no judgments on interconnected propositions. For example, court judgments in\nbreach-of-contract cases should respect the constraint that action and obligation are\nnecessary and sufficient for liability, and judgments on budget items should respect\nbudgetary constraints. In this paper, we make constraints in judgment aggregation\nexplicit by relativizing the rationality conditions of consistency and deductive closure\nto a constraint set, whose variation yields more or less strong notions of rationality.\nThis approach of explicit constraints contrasts with that of building constraints as\naxioms into the logic, which turns compliance with constraints into a matter of logical\nconsistency and thereby conflates requirements of ordinary logical consistency (such\nas not to affirm a proposition and also its negation) and requirements dictated by\nthe environment (such as budget constraints). We present some general impossibility\nresults on constrained judgment aggregation; they are immediate corollaries of known\nresults on (unconstrained) judgment aggregation.\n1 Introduction\nThe theory of judgment aggregation asks by which aggregation procedure a\ngroup of individuals can or should arrive at collective acceptance\/rejection judg-\nments on a given set of interconnected propositions (e.g., List and Pettit 2002,\nPauly and van Hees 2006, Dietrich 2006, Nehring and Puppe 2008). A classic\nillustration is given by the \u2018doctrinal paradox\u2019 (Kornhauser and Sager 1986).\nSuppose a three-member court has to make collective judgments on three con-\nnected propositions:\na: The defendant did action X.\nb: The defendant had a contractual obligation not to do action X.\nc: The defendant is liable for breach of contract.\nSuppose further that legal doctrine imposes the constraint that action and\nobligation (the two premises) are necessary and sufficient for liability (the con-\nclusion), in short c\u2194 (a\u2227 b). It can then happen that the majority judgments\non the two premises (a and b) conflict with the majority judgment on the con-\nclusion (c), relative to that constraint. Suppose, for example, the first judge\nholds both a and b to be true; the second holds a but not b to be true; and\nthe third holds b but not a to be true. If each judge individually respects the\na b c\nIndividual 1 True True True\nIndividual 2 True False False\nIndividual 3 False True False\nMajority True True False\nTable 1: The doctrinal paradox\nconstraint that c\u2194 (a\u2227 b), then the majority judgments \u2014 in support of a and\nb and against c \u2014 violate the given constraint, as shown in Table 1.\nThe conflict may disappear if we modify the constraint. For example, the\nmajority judgments {a, b,\u00acc} pose no problem if a and b are considered neces-\nsary but not sufficient for liability (so that the constraint is c\u2192 (a\u2227 b) instead\nof c \u2194 (a \u2227 b)), or if we introduce a third premise d (so that the constraint is\nc\u2194 (a \u2227 b \u2227 d)), or if we drop the constraint altogether.\nOur aim in this paper is to investigate judgment aggregation on general\nagendas of propositions with general sets of constraints. This framework is\nsuitable for modelling not only the court example but also many other judgment\naggregation problems. Judgments on budget items, for example, are required\nto respect budgetary constraints. If propositions a, b and c state, respectively,\nthat spending on education, healthcare and defense should be increased, then a\nbudgetary constraint could stipulate that not all three can be accepted together,\nformally \u00ac(a \u2227 b \u2227 c). Judgments on binary ranking propositions such as \u2018x is\npreferable to y\u2019, \u2018y is preferable to z\u2019 and \u2018x is preferable to z\u2019 are connected by\nconstraints such as transitivity or acyclicity. Judgments of biologists on whether\ntwo organisms fall into the same species are constrained by the assumption that\nbelonging to the same species is an equivalence relation.\nWe explain how constraints between propositions can be naturally incorpo-\nrated into the judgment aggregation model. Constraints have of course played\na role in earlier work, particularly in the computer science literature under the\nlabel \u2018integrity constraints\u2019 (e.g., Konieczny and Pino-Perez 2002). See also the\nnotion of \u2018context\u2019 in Nehring and Puppe (2008) and that of the \u2018axioms\u2019 in\nDietrich (2007).\nWe present two general impossibility theorems that depend on the nature\nof those constraints. The results are corollaries of results in Dietrich and List\n(2007a), but have a somewhat different interpretational flavour. They are also\nclosely related to results by Dokow and Holzman (forthcoming) and prior results\nby Nehring and Puppe (2002).\nTo illustrate our approach, we apply our two theorems to the aggregation\nof judgments on binary relations (which can represent various forms of compar-\nisons), distinguishing between different constraint sets on such binary relations.\nIn particular, we consider strict orderings, acyclic binary relations and equiv-\nalence relations. This application generalizes earlier results by List and Pettit\n(2001\/2004), Dietrich (2007), Dietrich and List (2007a) and Nehring and Puppe\n2\n(2008) on the representation of preference aggregation in the judgment aggre-\ngation model (a related result drawing on the \u2018property space\u2019 framework is\nNehring 2003). A comprehensive bibliography on judgment aggregation can be\nfound online (List 2004-7).\nThis paper draws extensively on our prior work Dietrich and List (2008a).\n2 The model\nWe consider a group of individuals N = {1, 2, . . . , n} (n \u2265 2). The propositions\non which judgments are made are represented in logic (following List and Pettit\n2002, 2004; we use Dietrich\u2019s 2007 generalized model).\n2.1 Logic\nA logic is an ordered pair (L, \u22a2), where (i) L is a non-empty set of sentences,\ncalled propositions, closed under negation (i.e., if p \u2208 L then \u00acp \u2208 L, where \u00ac\ndenotes \u2018not\u2019), and (ii) \u22a2 is an entailment relation, where, for each set S \u2286 L\nand each proposition p \u2208 L, S \u22a2 p is read as \u2018S entails p\u2019 (we write p \u22a2 q to\nabbreviate {p} \u22a2 q).1 A set S \u2286 L is inconsistent if S \u22a2 p and S \u22a2 \u00acp for some\np \u2208 L, and consistent otherwise. We require the logic to satisfy the following\nminimal conditions:2\n(L1) For all p \u2208 L, p \u22a2 p (self-entailment).\n(L2) For all p \u2208 L and S \u2286 T \u2286 L, if S \u22a2 p then T \u22a2 p (monotonicity).\n(L3) \u2205 is consistent, and each consistent set S \u2286 L has a consistent superset\nT \u2286 L containing a member of each pair p,\u00acp \u2208 L (completability).\nIn standard propositional logic, L contains propositions such as a, b, a \u2227 b,\na \u2228 b, \u00ac(a\u2192 b) (where \u2227, \u2228, \u2192 denote \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if-then\u2019, respectively). The\nset {a, a \u2192 b} entails proposition b, for example, whereas the set {a \u2228 b} does\nnot entail a. Examples of consistent sets are {a, a\u2192 b, b} and {a\u2227b}, examples\nof inconsistent ones {a,\u00aca} and {a, a\u2192 b,\u00acb}.\n2.2 Agenda\nThe agenda is the set of propositions on which judgments are made, defined\nas a non-empty subset X \u2286 L expressible as X = {p,\u00acp : p \u2208 X+} for a\n1Formally, \u22a2\u2286 P(L)\u00d7 L, where P(L) is the power set of L.\n2Alternatively we may assume three conditions on the consistency notion (jointly equiv-\nalent to L1-L3): (C1) All sets {p,\u00acp} \u2286 L are inconsistent; (C2) subsets of consistent sets\nS \u2286 L are consistent; (C3) L3 holds. In many (non-paraconsistent) logics, the notion of entail-\nment is uniquely determined by that of consistency (via A \u22a2 p\u21d4 [A \u222a {\u00acp} is inconsistent]),\nso that the two notions are interdefinable. If we restrict attention to logics with interdefin-\nability, or if we are ultimately interested only in whether judgments are consistent (not in\nwhether they are deductively closed), we can use the system of consistent sets rather than\nthe relation \u22a2 as the primitive logical notion (and assume C1-C3). For details see Dietrich\n(2007).\n3\nset X+ \u2286 L of unnegated propositions. Notationally, we assume that double\nnegations cancel each other out (i.e., \u00ac\u00acp stands for p).3 In the three-member\ncourt example, X = {a,\u00aca, b,\u00acb, c,\u00acc}.\n2.3 Constraints\nA constraint set is a consistent subset C \u2286 L. It is meant to represent logical\ninterconnections that are stipulated to hold between propositions. In the three-\nmember court example, C = {c\u2194 (a \u2227 b)}. We say that a set S \u2286 L entails a\nproposition p \u2208 L relative to C, formally S \u22a2C p, if S\u222aC \u22a2 p. We say that a set\nS \u2286 L is consistent relative to C if S\u222aC is consistent, and inconsistent relative\nto C otherwise. Hereafter we refer to C-entailment and C-(in)consistency. The\nrelationship between C-(in)consistency and C-entailment is analogous to that\nbetween (in)consistency and entailment simpliciter, which can be seen as the\nspecial cases of C-(in)consistency and C-entailment for C = \u2205. A set S \u2286 L\nis minimally C-inconsistent if S is C-inconsistent but every proper subset of S\nis C-consistent. A proposition p \u2208 L is C-contingent if {p} and {\u00acp} are C-\nconsistent. Informally, a C-contingent proposition is one whose truth or falsity\nis not settled by the constraints in C alone.\n2.4 Individual judgment sets\nEach individual i\u2019s judgment set is the set Ai \u2286 X of propositions that he or\nshe accepts. On a belief interpretation, Ai is the set of propositions believed\nby individual i to be true; on a desire interpretation, the set of propositions\ndesired by individual i to be true. A judgment set Ai is\n\u2022 C-consistent if, as just defined, Ai \u222a C is consistent;\n\u2022 C-deductively closed if it contains all propositions p \u2208 X such thatAi\u222aC \u22a2\np (i.e., Ai \u22a2C p);\n\u2022 complete if it contains a member of each proposition-negation pair p,\u00acp \u2208\nX.\nA profile is an n-tuple (A1, . . . , An) of individual judgment sets.\n2.5 Aggregation functions\nAn aggregation function is a function F that maps each profile (A1, . . . , An) from\nsome domain of admissible ones to a collective judgment set F (A1, . . . , An) =\nA \u2286 X, the set of propositions that the group as a whole accepts. The judgment\n3Strictly speaking, when we use the symbol \u00ac hereafter, we mean a modified negation\nsymbol \u223c, where \u223c p := \u00acp if p is unnegated and \u223c p := q if p = \u00acq for some q. This\nconvention is to ensure that p \u2208 X implies \u00acp \u2208 X.\n4\nset A can be interpreted as the set of propositions collectively believed to be\ntrue or as the set collectively desired to be true. Below we impose minimal\nconditions on aggregation functions (including on the domain of admissible\nprofiles and the co-domain of admissible collective judgment sets). Standard\nexamples of aggregation functions are\n\u2022 majority voting, where F (A1, ..., An) is the set of propositions p \u2208 X for\nwhich the number of individuals with p \u2208 Ai exceeds that with p \/\u2208 Ai;\n\u2022 dictatorships, where F (A1, ..., An) = Ai for some antecedently fixed indi-\nvidual i \u2208 N ; and\n\u2022 inverse dictatorships, where F (A1, ..., An) = {\u00acp : p \u2208 Ai} for some\nantecedently fixed individual i \u2208 N .\n3 Why explicit constraints?\nWe could avoid explicit reference to constraints by building them into the logic.\nIndeed, whenever the logic (L,\u22a2) satisfies L1, L2 and L3, then so does the logic\n(L,\u22a2C) induced by the constraint set C. C-consistency in (L,\u22a2) translates into\nstandard consistency in (L,\u22a2C), and C-deductive closure in (L,\u22a2) translates\ninto standard deductive closure in (L,\u22a2C). This is in fact the only insight\nneeded to translate existing theorems into theorems with explicit constraints.\nWhy, then, should we use explicit constraints at all?\n3.1 A first argument\nFirst of all, constraints introduce a different perspective on the notion of con-\nsistency. For a judgment set to be logically inconsistent is somewhat different\nand perhaps more dramatically \u2018irrational\u2019 than to be merely C-inconsistent,\ni.e., incompatible with the given constraints. If constraints are built into the\nlogic, the distinction between these two kinds of inconsistency disappears: all\ninconsistencies are by definition logical ones.\n3.2 A second argument\nThe nature of the appropriate set of constraints is often unclear or controversial.\nFor example, what are the correct budgetary constraints or legal constraints\nwhen a government cabinet makes decisions? It may thus be interesting to vary\nthe constraint set C, so that we can express the fact that a judgment set is C-\nconsistent yet C \u2032-inconsistent (for distinct C,C \u2032 \u2286 L). If reaching C-consistent\ncollective judgments turns out to be unrealistic, the group might look for C \u2032-\nconsistent collective judgments for a \u2018less ambitious\u2019 constraint set C \u2032, say a\nproper subset C \u2032 \u0001 C. There is a long tradition in social choice theory of\n5\nconsidering differently strong rationality constraints on preferences: one may or\nmay not require completeness, one may or may not require full transitivity etc.\nAs discussed later, each set of rationality conditions on preferences corresponds\nto a particular constraint set.\n3.3 A third argument\nIf it is unclear for some proposition p \u2208 L whether or not it should constrain\nthe group decision, a natural move is to put it into the agenda X (rather\nthan into the constraint set C): i.e., to let the group decide whether or not p\nshould constrain the judgments on the (other) propositions in the agenda. For\ninstance, the \u2018legal doctrine\u2019 in the introductory court example or the condition\nof a balanced budget might be made part of the agenda X rather than of the\nconstraint set C.\nWhen a constraint becomes a proposition under decision, its correct logi-\ncal representation becomes crucial. Let us illustrate this point using the two\nexamples just mentioned. First, consider the court example, and suppose the\n\u2018legal doctrine\u2019 (that action and obligation are necessary and sufficient for li-\nability) is not imposed on the judges but put up for decision. One might be\ntempted to represent the legal doctrine as a material biconditional c\u2194 (a\u2227 b).\nThis, however, is a problematic representation. Consider the resulting agenda\nX = {a,\u00aca, b,\u00acb, c,\u00acc, c\u2194 (a \u2227 b),\u00ac(c\u2194 (a \u2227 b))}. When a judge rejects the\nlegal doctrine, what he or she rejects is in fact not the material biimplication\nc \u2194 (a \u2227 b); indeed, he or she may well believe that a, b and c are all true\nor all false (so that c \u2194 (a \u2227 b) holds). Rather the judge rejects the binding\nnature of a and b for c. One might say, the judge rejects a subjunctive bicon-\nditional between c and a \u2227 b, or perhaps that he or she rejects the proposition\n\u0001(c\u2194 (a \u2227 b)), where \u0001 is a modal necessity operator (\u2018necessarily, i.e., in all\npossible worlds, it is the case that...\u2019). If the legal doctrine is represented using\na subjunctive biconditional or modal necessity operator, negating the resulting\nproposition becomes logically consistent with assigning arbitrary truth values\nto a, b and c, so that the previous problem is avoided.\nSimilarly, suppose a government faces a decision problem, and suppose a\nbalanced budget is not imposed as a constraint but represented by a proposition\np in the government\u2019s agenda X. One might be tempted to specify p as the\ndisjunction \u2228q\u2208Sq, where each proposition q \u2208 S describes a way in which\nthe budget can be balanced (such as \u2018low spending on education and average\nspending on social security and...\u2019). The problem here is similar to that just\nidentified in the court example. An individual who rejects the requirement that\nthe budget must be balanced may still hold other beliefs that entail a balanced\nbudget (i.e., that entail \u2228q\u2208Sq): he or she may see no necessity of a balanced\nbudget yet favour low total spending for other reasons. A more appropriate\nrepresentation of the balanced budget requirement might be to let p be the\nproposition O(\u2228q\u2208Sq), where O is a deontic \u2018ought\u2019 operator (\u2018it is required\n6\nthat...\u2019). SinceO(\u2228q\u2208Sq) states that the budget ought to be balanced, it becomes\nconsistent (in standard deontic logic) to negate O(\u2228q\u2208Sq) while asserting \u2228q\u2208Sq,\nwhich removes the problem that arises when p is defined as \u2228q\u2208Sq.\nHowever, if a constraint is not part of the agenda but part of the constraint\nset C, its misrepresentation is less problematic. The reason is that propositions\nin C cannot be negated, and often the logical interconnections induced by the\n(non-negated) constraints in the form of C-consistency and C-deductive closure\ndo not change if these constraints are misspecified in the sense just illustrated.\nIn the court example, for instance, the material biimplication c\u2194 (a\u2227b) imposes\nexactly the same constraints on a, b and c as a subjunctive one, and also as\nthe proposition \u0001(c \u2194 (a \u2227 b)), namely that a, b, c can only have truth values\n(T, T, T ) or (F, F, F ) or (T, F, F ) or (F, T, F ). For this reason, when giving\nconcrete examples of constraint sets in this paper we usually omit modal or\ndeontic necessity operators and do not address the nature of (bi)conditionals.\nFor instance, when we later consider the transitivity constraint on preferences,\nwe model it as the statement that \u2018preferences are transitive\u2019, not the statement\nthat \u2018preferences are necessarily transitive\u2019 (and similarly for other constraints\non preferences).4\n4 Impossibilities of aggregation under constraints\nCan we find attractive aggregation functions? The answer to this question de-\npends on two things. First, it depends on what conditions we impose on the\naggregation function. If, for example, we do not seek to achieve C-consistency\nat the collective level (for an appropriate C), majority voting may be a per-\nfectly fine solution. Likewise, in the absence of any democratic requirements,\na dictatorship of one individual arises as a possibility, which generates C-\nconsistent and complete judgment sets. If the only democratic requirement\nis non-dictatorship and we allow collective judgments to be incomplete but re-\ntain their C-consistency and C-deductive closure, then oligarchies arise as a\nsolution; here, any proposition is accepted if and only if all members of a fixed\nset M \u2286 N of \u2018oligarchs\u2019 accept it.5\nSecond, the question of whether we can find attractive aggregation functions\ndepends on how the propositions in the agenda are logically connected, which\nin turn depends on the constraint set C. More constraints can often make\n4On subjunctive implications in judgment aggregation, see Dietrich (forthcoming); on\nmodal operators for representing legal prescriptions, see List (2006) and Dietrich (2007).\n5More precisely, an oligarchy F is defined by F (A1, .., An) = \u2229i\u2208MAi for all profiles\n(A1, ..., An) in the universal C-domain (as defined below), whereM \u2286 N is a fixed non-empty\nset of \u2018oligarchs\u2019. Oligarchies generate C-consistent and C-deductively closed (but usually in-\ncomplete) collective judgment sets, as the intersection of C-consistent and C-deductively\nclosed sets is C-consistent and C-deductively closed. To avoid dictatorship, there must be at\nleast two oligarchs; if all individuals are oligarchs, F is unanimity rule, an anonymous rule\nwith considerable collective incompleteness.\n7\naggregation problems harder to solve. If the court in the original example did\nnot have to respect the constraint that action and obligation are necessary and\nsufficient for liability (c\u2194 (a\u2227 b)), then the majority judgments resulting from\nthe individual judgments in Table 1 would not be considered inconsistent.\nLet us address these questions in general terms. Consider some given agenda\nX and constraint set C. The theorems to be presented here are C-relativized\nversions of existing theorems from Dietrich and List (2007a). We choose to focus\non theorems that require complete and C-consistent (hence also C-deductively\nclosed) collective judgment sets. But one could equally obtain theorems that\nrequire merely C-consistent and C-deductively closed (possibly incomplete) col-\nlective judgment sets (by adapting results by Dietrich and List 2008b and Dokow\nand Holzman 2006), or theorems that require just C-consistent collective judg-\nment sets (by adapting recent results by Dietrich and List 2007b).\n4.1 An impossibility of systematic aggregation\nIn this subsection, we require the aggregation function to satisfy the following\nconditions:\nUniversal C-domain. The domain of F is the set of all possible profiles of\nC-consistent and complete individual judgment sets on the agenda X.\nCollective C-rationality. F generates C-consistent and complete collective\njudgment sets on the agenda X.\nSystematicity. For any propositions p, q \u2208 X and profiles (A1, . . . , An),\n(A\u22171, . . . , A\n\u2217\nn) \u2208 Domain(F ), if [for all individuals i, p \u2208 Ai if and only if\nq \u2208 A\u2217i ] then [p \u2208 F (A1, . . . , An) if and only if q \u2208 F (A\n\u2217\n1, . . . , A\n\u2217\nn)].\nUniversal C-domain requires that the aggregation function accept as admis-\nsible any possible profile of fully rational individual judgment sets respecting the\nconstraints in the set C. Collective C-rationality requires that the aggregation\nfunction produce as output a fully rational collective judgment set respecting\nthe same constraints. Systematicity requires, first, that the collective judgment\non each proposition depend only on individual judgments on that proposition,\nand, second, that the pattern of dependence be the same for all propositions.\nThe first part of the condition requires the aggregation to be propositionwise\n(as captured by the independence condition defined later), and the second part\nadds a neutrality requirement.\nCall agenda X minimally C-connected if it satisfies the following conditions:\n(i) X has a minimal C-inconsistent subset Y with |Y | \u2265 3, and\n8\n(ii) X has a minimal C-inconsistent subset Y such that (Y \\Z)\u222a{\u00acz : z \u2208 Z}\nis C-consistent for some subset Z \u2286 Y of even size.6\nIt is easy to see that the agenda X = {a,\u00aca, b,\u00acb, c,\u00acc} in the three-\nmember court example with constraint set C = {c\u2194 (a\u2227 b)} satisfies minimal\nC-connectedness. On the other hand, if C were the empty set, the agenda\nX = {a,\u00aca, b,\u00acb, c,\u00acc} would not be minimally C-connected: it would violate\nboth (i) and (ii). Thus the question of whether or not an agenda is minimally\nC-connected depends crucially on the strength of the constraint set C.\nThe following is a corollary of Dietrich and List\u2019s (2007) Theorem 1 (which\nin turn generalizes earlier results on systematicity by List and Pettit 2002 and\nPauly and van Hees 2006):\nTheorem 1. For a minimally C-connected agenda X, every aggregation func-\ntion F satisfying universal C-domain, collective C-rationality and systematicity\nis a (possibly inverse) dictatorship.\nThe agenda condition of Theorem 1 (minimal C-connectedness) is tight if\nthe agenda is finite or the logic is compact (and n \u2265 3 and X contains at least\none C-contingent proposition), i.e., minimal C-connectedness is also necessary,\nand not merely sufficient, for characterizing (possibly inverse) dictatorships by\nthe conditions of Theorem 1.7 The same holds for the agenda conditions of the\nother theorems stated below.\nThere are two ways in which Theorem 1 can be turned into a characterization\nof dictatorships as opposed to possibly inverse ones. One way is to impose an\nadditional unanimity condition on the aggregation function:\nUnanimity. For any unanimous profile (A, . . . , A) \u2208 Domain(F ),\nF (A, . . . , A) = A.\nTheorem 1a. For a minimally C-connected agenda X, every aggregation\nfunction F satisfying universal C-domain, collective C-rationality, systematicity\nand unanimity is a dictatorship.\nThe other way to obtain a characterization of dictatorships from Theorem\n1 is to impose an additional asymmetry condition on the agenda. Call agenda\n6This clause is for finite X equivalent to a C-relativized version of Dokow and Holzman\u2019s\n(forthcoming) non-affineness condition: the set of admissible yes\/no views on the propositions\nin X (corresponding to C-consistent and complete judgment sets on X) is a non-affine subset\nof {0, 1}X .\n7If X is not minimally C-connected, there exists an aggregation function that satisfies\nuniversal C-domain, collective C-rationality and systematicity and is not a (possibly inverse)\ndictatorship. Let M be a subset of {1, ..., n} of odd size at least 3. If part (i) of minimal\nC-connectedness is violated, then majority voting among the individuals in M satisfies all\nrequirements. If part (ii) is violated, the aggregation rule F with universal C-domain defined\nby F (A1, ..., An) := {p \u2208 X : the number of individuals i \u2208 M with p \u2208 Ai is odd} satisfies\nall requirements. The second example is based on Dokow and Holzman (2005).\n9\nX C-asymmetric if there exists a C-inconsistent subset Y \u2286 X such that {\u00acy :\ny \u2208 Y } is C-consistent.\nTheorem 1b. For a minimally C-connected and C-asymmetric agenda\nX, every aggregation function F satisfying universal C-domain, collective C-\nrationality and systematicity is a dictatorship.\n4.2 An impossibility of general propositionwise aggrega-\ntion\nThe above condition of systematicity is a strong condition on an aggregation\nfunction, which goes well beyond the requirement of propositionwise aggre-\ngation by adding the (neutrality-type) requirement of equal treatment of all\npropositions. We now ask whether we can obtain a characterization of dictator-\nships using the weaker condition of propositionwise aggregation, the so-called\nindependence condition, which drops the neutrality part of the systematicity\ncondition.\nIndependence. For any proposition p \u2208 X and profiles (A1, . . . , An), (A\u22171, . . . ,\nA\u2217n) \u2208 Domain(F ), if [for all individuals i, p \u2208 Ai if and only if p \u2208 A\n\u2217\ni ] then\n[p \u2208 F (A1, . . . , An) if and only if p \u2208 F (A\n\u2217\n1, . . . , A\n\u2217\nn)].\nLet us define the agenda condition of C-path-connectedness, building upon\nNehring and Puppe\u2019s (2002) condition of total blockedness.8 For any p, q \u2208 X,\nwe write p \u22a2\u2217C q if {p,\u00acq} \u222a Y is C-inconsistent for some Y \u2286 X that is C-\nconsistent with p and with \u00acq.9 Now an agenda X is C-path-connected if\n(iii) for every C-contingent p, q \u2208 X, there exist p1, p2, ..., pk \u2208 X (with p = p1\nand q = pk) such that p1 \u22a2\n\u2217\nC p2, p2 \u22a2\n\u2217\nC p3, ..., pk\u22121 \u22a2\n\u2217\nC pk.\nThe agenda in the three-member court example above is minimally C-\nconnected but not C-path-connected, but as shown below, preference aggre-\ngation problems can be represented by agendas that are both minimally C-\nconnected and C-path-connected. Call an agenda strongly C-connected if it is\nC-path-connected and satisfies (ii). It then follows (for finite X or a compact\nlogic) that X also satisfies (i) and hence that it is minimally C-connected as\nwell.\nTheorem 2. For a strongly C-connected agenda X, every aggregation\nfunction F satisfying universal C-domain, collective C-rationality, independence\nand unanimity is a dictatorship.\n8The relationship between C-path-connectedness and total blockedness arises when C = \u2205.\nFor a compact logic, \u2205-path-connectedness is equivalent to total blockedness; generally, \u2205-\npath-connectedness is weaker than total blockedness.\n9For non-paraconsistent logics (in the sense of L4 in Dietrich 2007), {p,\u00acq} \u222a Y is C-\ninconsistent if and only if {p} \u222a Y \u22a2C q.\n10\nThis result is the C-relativized version of a result proved independently\nby Dietrich and List (2007) and Dokow and Holzman (forthcoming).10 Both\nof these results extend a prior result by Nehring and Puppe (2002) with an\nadditional monotonicity condition on F .\nFinally, all results in this section continue to hold under generalized defini-\ntions of minimal and strong C-connectedness.11\n5 An application: binary relations\nTo illustrate the results above, we apply them to the aggregation of binary\ncomparisons, such as betterness judgments or judgments of (a given type of)\nequivalence. Such judgments are given by a binary relation over a set of objects\nto be compared, e.g., policy alternatives, job candidates or organisms to be\nclassified into species. How can binary relations be represented in the judgment\naggregation model? We use the following construction, drawing on List and\nPettit (2001\/2004), Dietrich (2007) and Dietrich and List (2007).\nA simple predicate logic. We consider a predicate logic with constants\nx, y, z, ... \u2208 K (representing objects), variables v, w, v1, v2 , ... (ranging over\nobjects), identity symbol =, a binary relation symbol P (representing the com-\nparative relation in question), logical connectives \u00ac (not), \u2227 (and), \u2228 (or), \u2192\n(if-then), and universal quantifier \u2200. Formally, L is the smallest set such that\n\u2022 L contains all propositions of the forms \u03b1P\u03b2 and \u03b1 = \u03b2, where \u03b1 and\n\u03b2 are constants or variables, and\n\u2022 whenever L contains two propositions p and q, then L also contains\n\u00acp, (p \u2227 q), (p \u2228 q), (p\u2192 q) and (\u2200v)p, where v is any variable.\nWe drop brackets when there is no ambiguity.\nConstraint sets. We consider some alternative constraint sets. We begin\nwith the constraint set on fully rational strict preferences, the paradigmatic\nbinary relation in social choice theory:\nCfully rational =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n(\u2200v1)(\u2200v2)(v1Pv2 \u2192 \u00acv2Pv1)\n(\u2200v1)(\u2200v2)(\u2200v3)((v1Pv2 \u2227 v2Pv3)\u2192 v1Pv3)\n(\u2200v1)(\u2200v2)(\u00ac v1=v2 \u2192 (v1Pv2 \u2228 v2Pv1))\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe 12.\n10Dokow and Holzman restrict the agenda to be finite (with only contingent propositions)\nand for this case show the tightness of the agenda assumptions (if n \u2265 3).\n11In the definitions of minimal and strong C-connectedness, (i) and (ii) can be weakened,\nnamely to the C-relativised versions of the conditions (i*) and (ii*) given in Dietrich (2007).\nAll theorems presented survive the weakening, and the agenda assumptions of Theorems 1,\n1a and 1b become tight even for infinite X in a non-compact logic (again provided that X\ncontains a contingent proposition and n \u2265 3). The weakened conditions become equivalent\nto the original ones for finite X or a compact logic.\n12For technical reasons, the constraint set also contains, for each pair of distinct constants\nx, y, the condition \u00acx=y.\n11\nThe three displayed propositions in Cfully rational are the constraints of asym-\nmetry, transitivity and connectedness. To represent weak preferences rather\nthan strict ones, Cfully rational needs to be redefined as the set of rationality con-\nditions on weak preferences (i.e., reflexivity, transitivity and connectedness); see\nalso Dietrich (2007).13\nContrast this with the constraint set on merely acyclic (but not necessarily\nfully rational) strict preferences, representing a weaker notion of rationality:\nCacyclic =\n{\n\u00ac(\u03b11Pa2 \u2227 ... \u2227 \u03b1m\u22121Pam \u2227 amPa1)\n: a1, ...am \u2208 K pairwise distinct, m \u2265 1\n}\n14.\nThe propositions in Cacyclic rule out any cycle of any length m \u2265 1. In\nparticular, irreflexivity is enforced (take m = 1). Transitivity, however, is\nnot required. Thus the set {xPy, yPz,\u00acxPz}, while inconsistent relative to\nCfully rational, is consistent relative to Cacyclic.\nNext we consider the constraint set on equivalence relations, suitable for\nclassifying objects:\nCequivalence =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n(\u2200v)(vPv)\n(\u2200v1)(\u2200v2)(\u2200v3)((v1Pv2 \u2227 v2Pv3)\u2192 v1Pv3)\n(\u2200v1)(\u2200v2)(v1Pv2 \u2192 v2Pv1))\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe 15.\nThe three displayed propositions in Cequivalence are the constraints of reflexiv-\nity, transitivity and symmetry. While this constraint set would obviously not be\nimposed when P represents a preference relation (since \u2018better than\u2019 is neither\nreflexive nor symmetric), it may be imposed on a relation of equal suitabil-\nity between job candidates (since \u2018is as suitable as\u2019 is plausibly an equivalence\nrelation) or on the relation of belonging to the same species among organisms.\nEach of these constraint sets C induces its own notions of C-consistency and\nC-deductive closure.\nThe agenda. The binary-relation agenda is the set X of all propositions of\nthe form xPy,\u00acxPy \u2208 L, where x and y are constants. The question of which\nagenda condition is met by the binary-relation agenda depends crucially on the\ngiven constraint set. The following lemma holds:\nLemma 1. The binary-relation agenda X (with |K| \u2265 3) is\n(a) strongly C-connected when C = Cfully rational;\n13Transitivity and connectedness are as defined above. Reflexivity can be stated by the\nproposition (\u2200v)(vPv). For aesthetic reasons, one might also replace the predicate symbol P\nby R in the logic.\n14Again, the constraint set also contains, for each pair of distinct constants x, y, the condi-\ntion \u00acx=y.\n15Again, the constraint set also contains, for each pair of distinct constants x, y, the condi-\ntion \u00acx=y.\n12\n(b) minimally, but not strongly, C-connected when C = Cacyclic;\n(c) minimally, but not strongly, C-connected when C = Cequivalence.\nIn part (a), the C-path-connectedness part is a variant of a lemma by\nNehring (2003); for instance, xPy \u22a2\u2217C xPz because {xPy, yPz} \u22a2C xPz (where\nx, y, z \u2208 K are pairwise distinct). In parts (a) and (b), minimal C-connectedness\nholds since any cycle Y = {xPy, yPz, zPx} \u2286 X defines a minimalC-inconsistent\nset, which becomes C-consistent by negating two elements. In part (c), minimal\nC-connectedness holds because any set of type Y = {xPy, yPz,\u00acxPz} \u2286 X\n(with x, y, z pairwise distinct) is minimally C-inconsistent and becomes C-\nconsistent by negating any two members.\nBy this lemma, Theorems 1, 1a and 1b apply to the binary relation agenda\nfor any of the three constraint sets C. This allows the conclusion that it is\nimpossible to aggregate preference relations \u2014 whether fully rational or just\nacyclic \u2014 or equivalence relations in a systematic and non-degenerate way, unless\nwe restrict the domain of individual inputs or allow some kind of collective\nirrationality (such as incomplete collective judgment sets).\nBy part (a), the stronger impossibility of Theorem 2 applies when the con-\nstraint set is Cfully rational. It is impossible to aggregate fully rational preference\nrelations in an independent, unanimity preserving and non-dictatorial manner,\nagain unless we restrict the domain of individual inputs or allow collective irra-\ntionality. The latter is precisely Arrow\u2019s famous theorem on the aggregation of\npreferences (in the case where indifference between distinct options is excluded).\nIn conclusion, the present approach allows us to derive a large number of\ngeneral results on aggregation problems with various constraints in a simple\nunified framework. An interesting question for future research is how the results\nare affected when different constraints are imposed at individual and collective\nlevels, for example, when the constraints on collective judgments are weaker\nthan those on individual ones or vice-versa.\n6 References\nDietrich F (2006) Judgment Aggregation: (Im)Possibility Theorems.
