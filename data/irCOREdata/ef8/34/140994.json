Floating-point arithmetic parameter\nuncertainty is multiplicative, unlike parameter uncertainty resulting from fixed-point arith-\nmetic. Based on first-order eigenvalue sensitivity analysis, an upper bound on the eigenvalue\nperturbations is derived. Consequently, open-loop and closed-loop eigenvalue sensitivity\nmeasures are proposed. These measures are dependent upon the filter\/controller realisa-\ntion. Problems of obtaining the optimal realisation with respect to both the open-loop and\nthe closed-loop eigenvalue sensitivity measures are posed. The problem for the open-loop\ncase is completely solved. Solutions for the closed-loop case are obtained using nonlinear\nprogramming. The problems are illustrated with a numerical example.\n1\n1 Introduction\nThe finite word-length used for number representation in digital computers means that con-\ntrollers and filters implemented with digital hardware are subjected to errors. The errors in the\narithmetic result from two sources (Mullis and Roberts, 1976). The first is quantisation errors\nresulting from the quantisation of the signals and roundoff of the results of multiplication and\naddition. The second is coefficient errors resulting from the rounding of the coefficients of the\nfilter\/controller. This paper is concerned with the second of these. There are other finite word-\nlength effects that need to be considered in implementing digital filters\/controllers, notably the\neffects of overflow and (for floating point arithmetic) underflow, and limit cycles resulting from\nthe quantisation. These are not considered in this paper.\nIn the past, digital controllers were often implemented using fixed point arithmetic, however,\nthe reducing cost and increasing speed of computer hardware means that there is an increasing\ntendency for implementations to use floating-point arithmetic. It is well known (Wilkinson,\n1963, e.g.) that quantisation and rounding effects with floating point arithmetic is of a different\nnature to that of fixed point. Fixed-point quantisation error results in additive noise indepen-\ndent of the signal, but with floating-point arithmetic, the quantisation error is correlated with\nthe signal that is being quantised. Similarly, coefficient rounding in fixed-point arithmetic re-\nsults in additive perturbations on the coefficients, whereas with floating-point arithmetic, the\nperturbations are multiplicative. Thus the analysis and optimisation of finite-precision filter and\ncontroller implementations needs to take the arithmetic into account.\nThe quantisation error effect on digital filters resulting from the finite precision using floating-\npoint arithmetic has been fairly extensively studied over the last 4 decades (for example, Sand-\nberg, 1967; Liu and Kaneko, 1969; Kan and Aggarwal, 1971; Kaneko and Liu, 1971; Liu, 1971;\nZeng and Neuvo, 1991; Smith et al., 1992; Rao, 1996; Bomar, Smith and Joseph, 1997; Tsai,\n1997; Ko and Bitmead, 2004), see Kontro, Kallioja\u00a8rvi and Neuvo (1992) for a review. The\neffect of coefficient rounding in floating-point arithmetic seems first to have been considered\nby Kaneko and Liu (1971) (see also Liu, 1971), who analysed the sensitivity of the filter poles\nand the sensitivity of the frequency response to multiplicative perturbations on the coefficients\nfor several filter structures. Liu (1971) also performs an analysis of the sensitivity of the filter\nfrequency response, as do both Ku and Ng (1975) and Kallioja\u00a8rvi and Astola (1994).\nThe finite-precision effects on closed-loop control systems have been extensively studied for fixed-\npoint implementations, see Istepanian and Whidborne (2001) for a review. There has been far\nless work looking explicitly at the finite-precision effects for floating-point digital controller\nimplementations. The quantisation errors have been analysed by Rink and Chong (1979a,b),\nand by Vanwingerden and De Koning (1984) for optimal controllers. Miller, Mousa and Michel\n2\n(1988) have also analysed the quantisation errors, but notably also include the inter-sample\nbehaviour. A method to design optimal controllers that minimise the quantisation errors has\nbeen developed by de Oliveira and Skelton (2001). The effect on the robust stability caused\nby coefficient rounding has been analysed by Molchanov and Bauer (1995), but an additive\nperturbation is assumed for the floating point implementation. Closed-loop stability subject to\nperturbations on the floating-point coefficients has been analysed by Faris et al. (1998) using\nmodern robust techniques. The sensitivity of the time responses has been analysed by Farrell\nand Michel (1989) for both fixed and floating-point arithmetic.\nIt is known that some controller\/filter realisations are very sensitive to small errors in the\nparameters, and these small errors can even lead to instability. These parameter errors may\nresult from the finite-precision of the computing device. Such controller realisations can be\ndescribed as fragile (Keel and Bhattacharryya, 1997). However, a dynamical system has an\ninfinite number of equivalent realisations. If a digital linear system is implemented in the state\nspace form, C(zI \u2212A)\u22121B+D, then CT (zI \u2212T\u22121AT )\u22121T\u22121B+D is an equivalent realisation\nfor any non-singular matrix T . It so happens that the effect of the finite precision is partially\ndependent upon the realisation. Thus, in order to ensure a non-fragile implementation, it is of\ninterest to know the realisation, or matrix T , which minimises the effect on the system of the\nfinite precision.\nOne approach to obtaining non-fragile realisations is to minimise the sensitivity of the system\neigenvalues. This approach has been extensively investigated for fixed-point realisations. It was\nfirst considered for the open-loop (filter) case by Mantey (1968), and subsequently by Gevers\nand Li (1993) who solved the problem for state-space realisations based on a norm for the\nopen-loop eigenvalue sensitivities. The case of the closed-loop system eigenvalue sensitivity for\nstate-space controller realisations was first considered by Li (1998) and has subsequently been\nthoroughly investigated (Istepanian et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1999; Wu, Istepanian and Chen,\n1999; Istepanian et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000; Whidborne, Istepanian and Wu, 2001).\nIn this paper, a simple eigenvalue sensitivity measure is considered for both filter and controller\nrealisations. The filter problem is completely solved whilst solutions to the controller problem\nmay be obtained using non-linear programming. The main results of this paper were originally\npresented by Whidborne and Gu (2002). Other eigenvalue sensitivity minimisation indices for\nfloating-point implementations have recently been proposed by Wu et al. (2003, 2004). An\nalternative eigenvalue sensitivity index has been proposed for floating point arithmetic by Ko\nand Yu (2004), and conditions for the existence of a minimizing realisation established. However\nadditive perturbations on the coefficients are assumed, and this index is actually an upper bound\non an index proposed by Whidborne, Istepanian and Wu (2001).\nIn the next section, floating-point arithmetic is discussed and the rounding operation is shown\n3\nto result in multiplicative perturbations on the filter\/controller coefficients. Based on this per-\nturbation model, an upper bound on the eigenvalue perturbations is obtained in Section 3. In\nSection 4, a measure of the relative stability based on this upper bound is proposed for digital\nfilter implementations, and the problem of minimising this measure for state-space realisations\nis solved. In Section 5, a similar measure for closed-loop controller implementations is pro-\nposed. Nonlinear programming is proposed to obtain solutions to the closed-loop problem. The\nproblems are illustrated by a numerical example in the penultimate section, and non-linear\nprogramming is shown to be effective for the closed-loop problem.\nNotations\n\u230ax\u230b denotes the floor function, that is, the largest integer less than or equal to x\nA \u25e6B = [aijbij ] denotes the Hadamard product of A and B\nAT denotes the transpose of a matrix A\nAH denotes the complex conjugate transpose of a matrix A\nvec(A) denotes the column stacking operator of a matrix A\n\u2016A \u2016F =\n\u221a\u2211\ni,j a\n2\nij denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix A\nA1\/2 denotes, for a matrix A \u2265 0, the unique symmetric matrix satisfying A1\/2 \u2265 0 and\nA1\/2A1\/2 = A\nC denotes the set of all complex numbers\nR denotes the set of all real numbers\nZ denotes the set of all integers\nO(x) denotes \u201cis of order x\u201d\n2 Floating-point representation\ns a1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a\u2113e b1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 b\u2113m\nsign\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nexponent e\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nmantissa m\nFigure 1: Floating-point number representation\nNumbers in a digital computer are represented by a finite number of bits \u2013 the word-length,\n\u2113 \u2208 Z+. In a floating-point arithmetic, the word consists of three parts:\n1. one bit, s \u2208 {0, 1}, for the sign of the number,\n4\n2. \u2113m \u2208 Z+ bits for the mantissa, m \u2208 R, and\n3. \u2113e \u2208 Z+ bits for the exponent, e \u2208 Z.\nTherefore, \u2113 = \u2113m + \u2113e + 1. The number is typically stored as shown in figure 1, and with this\nrepresentation, the value x is interpreted as\nx = (\u22121)s \u00d7m\u00d7 2e (1)\nwhere the mantissa is usually normalised so thatm \u2208 [.5, 1). Now, since \u2113e and \u2113m are finite, (\u2113 is\ntypically 16, 32 or 64 bits), the set of numbers that is represented by a particular floating-point\nscheme is not dense on the real line. Thus the set of possible floating-point numbers, F , is given\nby\nF :=\n{\n(\u22121)s\n(\n0.5 +\n\u2113m\u2211\ni=1\nbi2\n\u2212(i+1)\n)\n\u00d7 2e : s \u2208 {0, 1} , bi \u2208 {0, 1} , e \u2208 Z, e\n\u00af\n\u2264 e \u2264 e\u00af\n}\n\u222a{0} (2)\nwhere e\n\u00af\n\u2208 Z and e\u00af \u2208 Z represent the lower and upper limits of the exponent respectively, and\ne\u00af\u2212e\n\u00af\n= 2\u2113e\u22121. Note that unlike fixed-point representation, underflow can occur in floating-point\narithmetic.\nIn the remainder of this paper, it is assumed that no underflow or overflow occurs, that is \u2113e is\nunlimited, so e \u2208 Z. Define the floating-point rounding operator, q : R \u2192 F , as\nq(x) :=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3sgn(x)2\n(e\u2212\u2113m\u22121)\n\u230a\n2(\u2113m\u2212e+1) |x|+ 0.5\n\u230b\n, for x 6= 0\n0, for x = 0\n(3)\nwhere e = \u230alog2 |x|\u230b+ 1.\nThe rounding error, \u03b5, is defined as\n\u03b5 := |x\u2212 q(x)| . (4)\nIt can be shown easily that the rounding error is bounded by\n\u03b5 < |x| 2\u2212(\u2113m+1). (5)\nThus, when a number is implemented in finite-precision floating-point arithmetic, it may be\nperturbed to\nq(x) = x(1 + \u03b4), |\u03b4| < \u03b4max. (6)\nwhere \u03b4max = 2\n\u2212(\u2113m+1). Thus, as is well-known (Wilkinson, 1963), the perturbation is multi-\nplicative, unlike the perturbation resulting using finite-precision fixed-point arithmetic, which is\nadditive.\n5\n3 Eigenvalue sensitivity\nIn general, the perturbations on the controller parameters resulting from finite-precision imple-\nmentation will be very small. Thus, perturbations on the closed-loop system eigenvalues can\nbe approximated by considering the first-order term of a Taylor expansion, i.e. the eigenvalue\nsensitivities to changes in the controller parameters. A number of different eigenvalue sensitivity\nindices have bee proposed for fixed-point digital controller and filter implementations (Mantey,\n1968; Gevers and Li, 1993; Li, 1998; Istepanian et al., 1998; Whidborne, Istepanian and Wu,\n2001; Wu et al., 2001).\nAssume that a controller\/filter realisation x = vec(X) is implemented with floating-point arith-\nmetic with finite precision, that is the actual realisation will be q(x). Then, from (6), each\nelement of x will be perturbed to xi(1 + \u03b4i), |\u03b4i| < \u03b4max = 2\n\u2212(\u2113m+1), and the realisation vector\nwill be perturbed to x+ x \u25e6 \u03b4 where \u03b4 = [\u03b4i].\nProposition 1. Let f(x) \u2208 C be a differentiable function of x \u2208 Rnx. Assume that x is perturbed\nto x\u02dc where x\u02dci = xi(1 + \u03b4i). Then, to a first-order Taylor series approximation\n|f(x\u02dc)\u2212 f(x)| \u2264 \u03b4max\u2016 g \u20162\u2016x \u20162 +\n\u2223\u2223O(\u03b42max)\u2223\u2223 (7)\nwhere |\u03b4i| < \u03b4max for all i and g(x) is the gradient vector, i.e.,\ng(x) :=\n\u2202f(x)\n\u2202x\n=\n[\n\u2202f\n\u2202xi\n]\nx\n(8)\nevaluated at x.\nProof. Taking a first-order Taylor series approximation:\nf(x\u02dc) = f(x) +\nnx\u2211\ni=1\n(\n\u2202f\n\u2202xi\n)\nx\n(x\u02dci \u2212 xi) +O(\u03b4\n2\nmax) (9)\nNow, from (6), x\u02dci = xi(1 + \u03b4i), so\nf(x\u02dc)\u2212 f(x) =\nnx\u2211\ni=1\ngi(x)xi\u03b4i +O(\u03b4\n2\nmax). (10)\nHence\n|f(x\u02dc)\u2212 f(x)| \u2264\nnx\u2211\ni=1\n|gi(x)| |xi| |\u03b4i|+\n\u2223\u2223O(\u03b42max)\u2223\u2223 (11)\n< \u03b4max\nnx\u2211\ni=1\n|gi(x)| |xi|+\n\u2223\u2223O(\u03b42max)\u2223\u2223 (12)\nwhich, by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, gives\n|f(x\u02dc)\u2212 f(x)| < \u03b4max\u2016 g(x) \u20162\u2016x \u20162 +\n\u2223\u2223O(\u03b42max)\u2223\u2223 . (13)\n6\nIf f(\u00b7) is the system pole\/eigenvalue, x is the infinite-precision parameter vector and x\u02dc is the\nfinite-precision parameter vector, then Proposition 1 can be used to measure the relative system\nstability when subject to finite-precision implementation using floating-point arithmetic. Based\non Proposition 1, tractable eigenvalue sensitivity indices can be formulated which are appropriate\nfor finite-precision floating-point digital controller and filter implementations.\n4 Optimal digital filter realisations\nConsider the problem of implementing a digital filter, F (z) = Cf (zI \u2212 Af )\n\u22121Bf + Df , where\nAf \u2208 R\nn\u00d7n and has no repeated eigenvalues, Bf \u2208 R\nn\u00d7q, Cf \u2208 R\nl\u00d7n and Df \u2208 R\nl\u00d7q. In\nthis paper, (Af , Bf , Cf , Df ) is also called a realisation of F (z). The realisations of F (z) are\nnot unique, if (A0f , B\n0\nf , C\n0\nf , D\n0\nf ) is a realisation of F (z), then so is (T\n\u22121A0fT, T\n\u22121B0f , C\n0\nfT,D\n0\nf )\nfor any non-singular similarity transformation T \u2208 Rn\u00d7n. The system poles are simply the\neigenvalues of Af . The problem under consideration is to find the similarity transformation\nsuch that the realisation has a minimal eigenvalue sensitivity when implemented using finite\nword-length floating-point arithmetic.\nBased on Proposition 1, the following tractable eigenvalue sensitivity index, \u03a6, is proposed\n\u03a6 = \u2016Af \u2016\n2\nF\nn\u2211\nk=1\nwk\u03a6k (14)\nwhere wk is a non-negative real scalar weighting and\n\u03a6k =\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225 \u2202\u03bbk\u2202Af\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252\nF\n(15)\nwhere {\u03bbi : i = 1, . . . , n} represents the set of unique eigenvalues of Af . The weights, wk,\nk = 1, . . . , n, are generally chosen so that the eigenvalues closer to the unit circle have the larger\nvalues. The measure \u03a6 is dependent upon the filter realisation, that is, given Af = T\n\u22121A0fT ,\n\u03a6(T ) :=\n\u2225\u2225T\u22121A0fT \u2225\u22252F\nn\u2211\nk=1\nwk\u03a6k(T ) (16)\nwhere, (Gevers and Li, 1993; Li, 1998),\n\u03a6k(T ) = tr\n(\nRHk T\n\u2212T T\u22121Rk\n)\ntr\n(\nLHk TT\nT Lk\n)\n(17)\nand where Rk and Lk are the right and left eigenvectors respectively for the kth eigenvalue of\nA0f .\nProblem 1. Given an initial realisation (A0f , B\n0\nf , C\n0\nf , D\n0\nf ), calculate\n\u03a6min = min\nT\u2208Rn\u00d7n\ndet(T ) 6=0\n\u03a6(T ) (18)\n7\nand calculate a subsequent similarity transformation Tmin such that \u03a6min = \u03a6(Tmin).\nTheorem 1. The solution to Problem 1 is given by\n\u03a6min =\nn\u2211\nk=1\n|\u03bbk|\n2\nn\u2211\nk=1\nwk (19)\nand\nTmin =\n(\nRWRH\n)1\/2\nV (20)\nwhere R = [Ri] is the matrix of right eigenvectors of A\n0\nf , W = diag(w1, . . . , wn) is a diagonal\nmatrix of the weights and V is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix.\nProof. From Lemma 6.2 and Theorem 6.1 of Gevers and Li (1993, pp137-138), it follows that\n\u03a6k \u2265 1 with equality for all k if Af is normal. From Horn and Johnson (1985, p101),\n\u2016Af \u2016\n2\nF \u2265\nn\u2211\nk=1\n|\u03bbk|\n2 (21)\nwith equality if Af is normal. Clearly, if Af is normal, \u03a6 is minimal and (19) holds. Theorem\n6.2 of Gevers and Li (1993, p141) gives (20).\nRemark 1. The requirement for minimal eigenvalue sensitivity for FWL fixed-point arithmetic\nis also that the transition matrix Af is in the normal form (Gevers and Li, 1993, p139).\n5 Optimal digital controller realisations\nP (z)\nC(z,X)\n-\n6\n-\nff ?ff\n-+\n+\n+ +\nr y\nw\nplant\ncontroller\nFigure 2: Feedback control system\nConsider the linear discrete-time feedback control system shown in figure 2.

(32)\nThe weights, wk, k = 1, . . . , n + m, are generally chosen so that the eigenvalues closer to the\nunit circle have the larger values. The measure \u03a5 is dependent upon the controller realisation.\nGiven an initial realisation (A0f , B\n0\nf , C\n0\nf , D\n0\nf ), then it can be easily shown that\n\u2016X \u20162F = tr(P\n\u22121A0cPA\n0T\nc ) + tr(P\n\u22121B0cB\n0T\nc ) + tr(PC\n0T\nc C\n0\nc ) + tr(D\n0\ncD\n0T\nc ), (33)\nwhere P = TT T and, from (27) \u2013 (30), that\n\u03a5k = tr(R\n0H\nk (2)P\n\u22121R0k(2)) tr(L\n0H\nk (2)PL\n0\nk(2)) + \u03b1k tr(L\n0H\nk (2)PL\n0\nk(2))\n+ \u03b2k tr(R\n0H\nk (2)P\n\u22121R0k(2)) + \u03b1k\u03b2k, (34)\nwhere \u03b1k = tr(R\n0H\nk (1)C\nH\np CpR\n0\nk(1)) and \u03b2k = tr(L\n0H\nk (1)BpB\nH\np L\n0\nk(1)). Rearranging gives\n\u03a5(P ) =\n(\ntr(P\u22121A0cPA\n0T\nc ) + tr(P\n\u22121B0cB\n0T\nc ) + tr(PC\n0T\nc C\n0\nc ) + tr(D\n0\ncD\n0T\nc )\n)\n\u00d7\n(n+m\u2211\nk=1\ntr(P\u22121MRk) tr(PMLk) + tr(PWL) + tr(P\n\u22121WR) + c\n)\n(35)\nwhere\nMRk = w\n1\/2\nk R\n0\nk(2)R\n0H\nk (2) (36)\nMLk = w\n1\/2\nk L\n0\nk(2)L\n0H\nk (2) (37)\nWL = L\n0(2) diag(w1\u03b11, . . . , wn+m\u03b1n+m)L\n0H(2), (38)\nWR = R\n0(2) diag(w1\u03b21, . . . , wn+m\u03b2n+m)R\n0H(2), (39)\nare all Hermitian, and\nc =\nn+m\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1k\u03b2k. (40)\nProblem 2. Given an initial realisation (A0c , B\n0\nc , C\n0\nc , D\n0\nc ), calculate\n\u03a5min = min\nP\u2208Rn\u00d7n\nP=PT >0\n\u03a5(P ) (41)\nwhere P = TT T , and calculate a subsequent similarity transformation Tmin such that \u03a5min =\n\u03a5(TminT\nT\nmin).\n10\nRemark 2. The function \u03a5(P ) is everywhere differentiable over the set {\u03a5(P ) : P = P T > 0}.\nHence it is proposed that nonlinear programming is used to find local solutions to Problem 2.\nThe problem of finding a global solution remains open.\nTo solve the problem using nonlinear programming, a search is required over n\u00d7n real, positive\ndefinite symmetric matrices. This can be accomplished by utilising a Cholesky factorisation\ngiven by the following theorem (Golub and Van Loan, 1989, p 141).\nTheorem 2 (Cholesky Factorisation). For P \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, P = P T , P > 0, there exists a unique\nlower triangular G \u2208 Rn\u00d7n with positive diagonal entries such that P = GGT .\nThus a search can be made over the set\n{\n[ gagb ] : ga \u2208 R\n(n\u22121)n\/2, gb \u2208 R\nn\n+\n}\n.\nRemark 3. Since V V T = I where V is any orthogonal matrix, then Pmin = GminV V\nTGTmin\nand so\nTmin = GminV. (42)\nThis provides an extra degree of freedom which could be utilised to find, for example, sparse\nrealisations (Li et al., 1992).\n6 Example\nThe following numerical example is taken from Gevers and Li (1993, pp 236-237).

(52)\nThe weights are set to wi = (1 \u2212 \u03bbmax)\/(1 \u2212 |\u03bbi|) where \u03bbmax = maxi{|\u03bbi|} and {\u03bbi} are\nthe eigenvalues of A0c and A\u00af (from (22)) for the open-loop and closed-loop sensitivity indices\nrespectively. Thus the eigenvalues closer to the unit circle have the larger weighting values.\nThe initial realisation has an open-loop pole sensitivity, \u03a6 = 1.5737\u00d7106. From Theorem 1, the\noptimal open-loop pole sensitivity \u03a6min = 6.1746, which can be achieved with the realisation\n(to 4 decimal places):\nAc =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n0.6194 \u22120.1992 \u22120.0835 \u22120.1265\n0.1346 0.6052 \u22120.2297 0.0171\n0.0508 0.1650 0.5315 \u22120.2813\n0.2047 0.0653 0.2218 0.5605\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb , (53)\nBc =\n[\n0.6508 0.0048 2.0020 0.2961\n]T\n\u00d7 106, (54)\nCc =\n[\n0.1100 0.0222 \u22120.0142 \u22120.0168\n]\n. (55)\nThe closed-loop pole sensitivity for the initial realisation is \u03a5 = 3.9903\u00d7 1022 and for the open-\nloop optimal realisation, it is \u03a5 = 9.8156 \u00d7 1021. It is a fairly common practice to implement\ncontrollers using a balanced realisation. Using the MATLABr routine balreal.m, a balanced\nrealisation was obtained (to 4 decimal places):\nAc =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n0.1119 0.5408 \u22120.1954 \u22120.0531\n\u22120.5408 0.7216 0.1647 0.0350\n\u22120.1954 \u22120.1647 0.7643 \u22120.1298\n0.0531 0.0350 0.1298 0.7189\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb , (56)\nBc =\n[\n203.1819 \u221263.5703 32.0424 \u22124.1143\n]T\n, (57)\nCc =\n[\n203.1819 63.5703 32.0424 4.1143\n]\n. (58)\n12\nThe closed-loop pole sensitivity for the balanced realisation is \u03a5 = 1.2546\u00d7 1011.\nThe MATLABr routine fminsearch.m was used with the Cholesky factorization of Theorem 2\nto solve Problem 2. The routine fminsearch.m implements the Nelder-Mead simplex method.\nUsing a 350 MHz Pentium PC, from a random starting point, the routine took about 30 minutes\nto converge. An optimal closed-loop pole sensitivity value of \u03a5min = 4.3366\u00d7 10\n8 was obtained\nwith a realisation (to 4 decimal places):\nAc =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\u22121.0614 \u22120.9631 \u22120.0054 \u22120.0018\n2.2892 1.7570 \u22120.0235 0.0057\n\u22121.4089 0.4759 0.6716 \u22120.0868\n1.7421 \u22122.3837 0.4706 0.9494\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb , (59)\nBc =\n[\n129.2367 \u2212137.2672 56.4560 \u221223.7868\n]T\n, (60)\nCc =\n[\n155.1427 \u2212119.5560 32.1475 1.0368\n]\n. (61)\n7 Discussion and conclusions\nIn previous works, the eigenvalue sensitivity approach to obtain optimal digital filter and con-\ntroller realisations so as to account for the finite precision inherent in digital computing devices\nhas been thoroughly investigated. However, there has been an assumption that the parameter\nuncertainty is additive. This assumption is perfectly valid for filter and controller implemen-\ntations that use fixed-point arithmetic, however, for floating-point arithmetic, the parameter\nuncertainty is multiplicative. It is becoming increasingly common to use floating-point arith-\nmetic for digital filters and controllers. Thus, in this paper, the work of Gevers and Li (1993)\nis extended to obtain optimal floating-point digital filter realisations; and the work of Whid-\nborne, Istepanian and Wu (2001) is extended to obtain optimal floating-point digital controller\nrealisations.\nThe methods are demonstrated on a numerical example of a control system. Both the initial\nrealisation of the controller and the optimal open-loop realisation result in very high closed-loop\npole sensitivities. This is significantly reduced by using a balanced realisation. However, the\nclosed-loop pole sensitivity of the balanced controller realisation can be reduced by three orders\nof magnitude by the optimal closed-loop realisation.\nReferences\nB.W. Bomar, L.M.
