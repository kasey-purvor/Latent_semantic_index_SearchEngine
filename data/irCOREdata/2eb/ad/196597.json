However, for the wetting angle of liquid Al-Mg alloys on ceramics, it is difficult to \nobtain an accurate measurement because aluminium is easily oxidized and the rate of \nevaporation of Mg is high. Here an oxide stripping device is used to provide an aluminium \nalloy droplet with minimal oxide on the surface when the droplet makes initial contact with the \nsubstrate. Results are reported for contact angle (\u03b8) versus time for Al-2.1, 3.9, 9.1 and 14.2 \nwt.%Mg alloys with sintered SiC substrates. The samples were quenched from the test \ntemperature. Magnesium is playing a key role in the adhesion, or otherwise, of the droplet to \nthe substrate. Magnesium is probably migrating to the surface of the droplet and evaporating  \nor forming a \u2018crusty\u2019 layer on the surface over time. When viewed from above, \u2018halo\u2019 regions, \ninitially showing interference colours, develop on the substrate around the base of the droplets. \nThese are probably associated with Mg (and Al) diffusing from the droplet across the surface \nof the substrate. \n INTRODUCTION \nCeramic reinforced\/Al alloy Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) are a family of advanced \nmaterials with attractive properties including high strength, high specific modulus, low \ncoefficient of thermal expansion, good wear resistance, low density and good thermal \nconductivity. The most important consideration in the fabrication of MMCs by liquid metal \nroutes is the issue of compatibility between the reinforcement and the matrix.1 This \ncompatibility has two related aspects, wettability at the liquid metal-ceramic interface and \nreaction between the two constituents. Both wettability and reactivity determine the quality of \nthe bond between the two materials and therefore greatly influence the final properties of the \ncomposite. The non-wettability of ceramic reinforcement by liquid aluminium is a major \nconsideration in the fabrication of aluminium matrix-ceramic composites below 1000K since \nthe liquid aluminium is readily covered with an oxide layer. In most cases wettability is poor, \nand, therefore, an external pressure is required to force the liquid metal into the preform.e.g.2 \nApplication of the required pressure is an additional cost. One approach to reduce the pressure \nrequired in the process, thereby making it more economical, is to select alloying additions that \npromote wetting of the reinforcement by the liquid metal.e.g.3  \n \nThe standard method for the evaluation of wettability is the sessile drop method4, which has \nbeen used to measure the wettability of a range of Al based alloys on SiC, 5-11 of pure Sn on \nSiC, 9,12 of pure Al or Al-alloys on Al2O3,\n13-15 on MgO,16 on graphite and on AlN.17,18 It is, \nhowever, difficult to obtain an accurate and repeatable measurement of the wetting angle of \nliquid Al-Mg alloys on ceramics, especially under vacuum, because the rate of evaporation of \nMg is high above the melting temperature.19 In the experiments described here an argon \n atmosphere is used to reduce the rate of evaporation in comparison with that which would be \nobtained under vacuum. It cannot, however, be avoided.  \n \nLiquid aluminium has a layer of Al2O3 on its surface since it has an extremely high affinity \nfor oxygen. However, when Mg is present, a spinel (MgAl2O4) and\/or a Mg containing oxide \n(MgO) layer may also be present.20 Delannay et al.21 reported that if alloying additions to \naluminium are more reactive than Al itself, Al in its oxide will be replaced by the active \nalloying addition. The formation of spinel is probably due either to absorption of Mg in the \ninterface and\/or to large negative free energies of formation. For the formation of MgAl2O4,  \n\u2206G(1073K) = -1852kJ\/mol and for Al2O3, \u2206G(1073K) = -1377.6 kJ\/mol..\n22 \n \nTwo different chemical interactions are expected between SiC and an aluminium matrix.23 The \nfirst is the interaction of liquid aluminium with the oxide film present on the surface of the SiC \nreinforcement:  \n \n3SiO2 + 4Al\u21d22Al2O3 + 3Si  \n \nand the second is the dissolution of the SiC given by: \n \n4Al + 3SiC\u21d2Al4C3 + 3Si, \n \nFormation of magnesium silicide is possible if Si from the above reactions combines with Mg \npresent in the Al melt24:  \n  \nSi + 2Mg = Mg2Si                             \nYaghmaee and Kaptay25 have examined the stability range of SiC in ternary liquid Al-Si-\nMg alloy and shown that a certain minimum critical Si content is needed in the melt to avoid the \nformation of Al4C3 at the interface. The critical Si-content has been found to increase both with \ntemperature and with the Mg-content of the melt. Results from Ferro and Derby26 reinforce the fact \nthat there is a critical level of Si required to suppress the formation of Al4C3. \n \nWettability in most ceramic\/metal systems for Metal Matrix Composites is poor but alloying \nadditions can be used to improve wettability. The additions fall into three categories: \n(i) those that reduce the surface tension of the melt; \n(ii)  those that decrease the solid-liquid interfacial energy; \n(iii) those that induce wettability through chemical reaction. \nThe role of magnesium has been reviewed by Hashim et al.27 Magnesium acts as a surfactant, \nreducing the surface tension of the liquid in comparison with that of pure aluminium.28 The \nreduction is sharp for the first 1 wt.% Mg addition. Magnesium can also act through reducing \nthe solid-liquid interfacial energy, aiding the reaction at the surface of the ceramic and forming \nnew compounds at the interface. Levi et al.29 suggested that bonding was achieved for an Al-\nMg alloy based composite through the formation of a MgAl2O4 layer by reaction at the solid-\nliquid interface. Other workers have also highlighted the role of MgAl2O4 in modifying the \noxide layer which covers the surface of the liquid aluminium30-38. \n \nThe aim of the experiments described here is to measure the contact angle versus time for a \nseries of Al-Mg alloys on SiC, using an oxide stripping device as the sessile drop is produced \n so that the effect of oxide layers on the surface is minimized. The effects of oxygen cannot be \navoided as there will be a native SiO2 layer on the SiC substrates and, even in five-nines \nargon, there will be more than enough oxygen (or water vapour) to oxidize both Mg and Al, \naccording to the Elligham diagram. In addition, the presence of the Ti getter is not sufficient to \nprevent oxidation occurring. However, with the oxide stripping device, the aim is for the \ndroplet to be momentarily almost oxide free so that as the droplet comes into contact with the \nsubstrate the instantaneous contact angle represents that between the alloy and the SiC with a \nnative SiO2 layer. We do not argue here that we have avoided the effects of oxygen but rather \nthat we have obtained results which can be compared with others in the literature and which \ndo provide some insight into the behaviour of Mg in the alloy. The distribution of the elements \nin the samples (in particular the Mg) is investigated with Energy Dispersive Analysis in the \nScanning Electron Microscope. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD \nMaterials \nThe target alloy compositions for the experiments were Al-2, 4, 9 and 14 wt.%Mg. 99.98% \npure Al was melted in a graphite crucible in a controlled atmosphere electrical heating furnace \nand Mg alloying additions having purity of 99.7% or better were added. The alloys were \nanalysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy  (ICPES) showing the \nactual compositions to be: 2.1, 3.9, 9.1 and 14.2 wt% Mg. For convenience the alloys will be \nreferred to as 2, 4, 9, and 14 wt% Mg in the text. The alloys were cast into a 20mm diameter \nchill cast ingot. The sintered 6H \u03b1-silicon carbide (SiC) for the substrates was supplied by \nWacker, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, and had composition 98.5 wt% SiC, 1.0 wt% free carbon \n and 0.3 wt% Al plus trace amounts of oxygen and nitrogen. Note that there will be a very thin \nlayer of silica on the surface. \n \nApparatus \nA schematic of the sessile drop apparatus is given in Figure 1. It consists of a transparent silica \nwork tube positioned vertically in a resistance furnace and a vacuum unit. The silica tube has \ndimensions of 50mm OD, 46mm ID and 800mm length. It is sealed at both ends with \"O\" \nringed end cups. The middle of the furnace has two observation windows. A ceramic (mullite) \ntube having one end drilled to 1mm diameter was used as a crucible and positioned on the \ncentreline of the silica tube. \n \n \n \nThe central feature of the apparatus is that the alloy is melted in the ceramic tube and is then \nforced out as a droplet onto the ceramic substrate by gas pressure. The orifice on the ceramic \ntube is designed so that the oxide skin is stripped from the surface of the droplet as it emerges. \nThis is similar to previous oxide stripping mechanisms 39-42. The droplet which is therefore in \ncontact with the ceramic substrate does not have the normal alumina skin interfering with the \nmeasurements. Evidence that the droplet is virtually oxide free will be presented later. To \navoid the stripped droplet oxidizing as it emerges, argon gas (99.999%) is fed in from below \nand drives any remaining oxygen in the atmosphere in the tube upwards (as it is heavier and \ndisplaces gas upwards). Vertical positioning is critical to the successful operation of the \napparatus. The vertical positioning mechanism allows careful placement of the substrate in \nrelation to the bottom of the ceramic tube. In most of the published works,5,7-13 the sessile drop \n rests on the substrate during heating up of the furnace. It is therefore difficult to determine the \nprecise contact time which should be quoted for a particular temperature. In the present work, \nhowever, a droplet of molten metal is gently dropped onto the substrate through the hole in the \nceramic tube when the predetermined temperature is reached. An advantage of the present \napparatus is that the silica tube, with its contents, can be quickly drawn downwards out of the \napparatus, hence quenching the sample. This enables a fast quench in comparison with the \npublished works,5,7-13  where it takes time to get the sample out of the furnace, again \nintroducing uncertainty about the precise contact time which should be quoted. \n \nMethodology for a Wetting Experiment  \nThe SiC material was slit with a diamond saw to dimensions 12x12x5mm for wettability \nstudies. The samples were then mounted, ground with 400, 600, 800, 100 and 1200 mesh SiC \npapers and polished with 6, 3 and 1 \u00b5m diamond paste.  Alloy pieces approximately 0.5g in \nweight were cut from pre-alloyed ingot material and placed in the ceramic tube. \n \nThe SiC substrate piece was placed on an alumina boat with the polished surface upwards. The \nrest of the alumina boat was filled with titanium sponge to act as a getter for residual oxygen \nin the environment. The alumina boat was placed in the middle of the length of the furnace in \nline with the observation windows. This was achieved by raising the alumina rod manually. \nHorizontal leveling of the SiC surface was achieved with the aid of a travelling microscope \nplaced in front of the observation window. Spacers at the position \u201cZ\u201d in Fig. 1 were used to \ntilt the silica tube to make the surface horizontal. Prior to the experiment, valves A, B, D and E \nwere turned on and the system was flushed for 1\/2 hour with high purity (99,999 %) argon. \nThen valves A, B, D and E were turned off and the system was evacuated down to 10-3 mbar \n vacuum. Argon was then introduced to the system until atmospheric pressure was reached \nfollowed by flushing with argon for further 1\/2 hour. This procedure was repeated 4 times to \nensure the system was fully cleaned of oxygen. Then the valves A and E were turned off and \nvalve C turned on to allow argon to flush through the top of the silica tube. The furnace was \nheated at a linear heating rate of 10oC\/min. As the temperature reached 750oC, a droplet of the \nmolten alloy sample in the ceramic tube is pushed out through the orifice using gas pressure \nonto the SiC substrate. The gas screw injection valve allows this to be done gently and in a \ncontrolled way. As the droplet is pushed through the 1mm diameter orifice in the ceramic tube, \nfresh aluminium surface, with no oxide film, is created. The Al droplet appears shiny when \nviewed through the observation window and indeed the reflection of resistance wires can be \nseen on the surface of the droplet. This is evidence that the objective of having a virtually \noxide free droplet is achieved. It is difficult to obtain an image demonstrating this but the \nreflection of the resistance wires can just be seen in Fig. 2a. For comparison, when the \nexperiment is carried out in a vacuum of 10-3 mbar with no argon flushing (and hence with \nsome oxygen present in the atmosphere), immediately after the droplet emerges it is much \nduller in appearance (compare Figs. 2a and 2b) and gave higher contact angles as compared to \nthe Ar flushed sample. (Note that it is not possible to carry out the experiment in air at \natmospheric pressure or in oxygen at atmospheric pressure as the droplet is too \u2018wrinkled\u2019.) \nA CCD camera unit was set up in front of the observation window to record the image of the \nmetallic drop. This unit consists of a CCD camera with a telephoto lens fitted to enlarge the \nimage. Images of sessile drops at rest on SiC were taken at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minute intervals \ntiming from the point at which the drop was established on the SiC. After 60 minutes, the \nsilica tube with its contents was plunged down out of the furnace to quench the droplet. After \nquenching, the system is let up to atmosphere and the sample removed from the tube. One \n sample was prepared without quenching to check whether any effects are due to condensation \nfrom the atmosphere during quenching. In that case, after dropping the Al-2wt%Mg melt onto \nthe surface of the SiC, 15 minutes contact time was allowed then the furnace was switched off \nand the apparatus left to cool with the sample inside.  \n \nMeasurements of Contact Angles  \nImages from the CCD camera were processed directly by using an AutoCAD 2000 computer \nsoftware program which calculates the contact angle automatically. The selected images were \nscanned and magnified approximately 12X by using the computer. This was done by drawing \na reference line at the bottom of drop and a tangent line from the apex of the angle. The \nvalidity of the resulting \u03b8\u2019s obtained from AutoCAD was established by comparing with \nresults from the Bashforth and Adams tables4,9 for selected samples. All values of  \u03b8 were \ncorrect to within an error of \u00b12\u00ba. \n \nAnalysis of Sessile Drop Samples after Quenching \nSome sessile drop samples adhered to the substrate and some did not. The samples were firstly \nexamined with a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZX12) and then in a SIRION Field Emission \nGun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEGSEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis \n(EDX). Analysis was carried out on both the drop surface and on the \u2018halo\u2019 region around the \ndrop on the SiC surface. Samples were sectioned transversely to examine the interior of the \ndroplet. For transverse sections, the droplets (and SiC substrates where these were still \nadherent) were cut with an ACCUTOM-2 slitting wheel and then mounted, ground with SiC \npaper, polished with 6 and 3\u03bcm diamond and finished with a colloidal silica polishing cloth. \n Between each step the sample was ultrasonically cleaned in ethyl alcohol for two minutes and \nrinsed in the same. The EDX analyses were at 20 keV apart from in the \u2018halo\u2019 region where \nresults were obtained at 10 keV. With 10keV the penetration depth of the electron beam into \nthe surface is less than for 20keV and thus the EDX results will be from the thin layer on the \nSiC surface which was leading to the interference colours in the \u2018halo\u2019 region, rather than from \nthe substrate beneath.  \n \nRESULTS  \n \nContact Angle \nThe results of contact angle measurements as a function of contact time at 750oC are shown in \nFig. 3.  \n \nThe contact angle, \u03b8, decreased initially with increasing contact time and then stabilised. The \noverall changes were small. The contact angle decreased with increasing Mg content in the \naluminium, with wetting (i.e \u03b8<90\u00b0) achieved for 9Mg and 14Mg additions.  \n \nScanning Electron Microscopy of the Surface of the Droplet \n \nFigure 4 shows an SEM image of Al-2wt%Mg on SiC substrate after a short contact time. The \ndroplet is relatively shiny when viewed by eye.    \n  \n The surface appearance for a higher Mg content droplet is shown in Fig. 5. The surface is now \nless smooth. When viewed by eye the droplet surface appears dull and dark.  \n     \nTable 1 gives the summary of the EDX results for the drop surfaces. In EDX scans no \nelements were found other than Al, Mg and Si. The surface is not a flat, polished surface and \ntherefore there is considerable inherent error. The results are therefore given to two significant \nfigures but are illustrative of trends. Note that the starting alloy does not contain Si. Note also \nthat we have concentrated on obtaining data for those samples where the droplet has remained \nadhering to the substrate. Further information on the 14%Mg is given in the section on the \ntransverse samples. The EDX analysis is for a small square area rather than a point.  \n  \nThe levels of magnesium on the surface of the drop are always higher than the original \nmagnesium content of the alloy. For the 2 wt%Mg alloy at 5 mins, the surface concentration is \nabout 8wt%, by 15 mins the concentration has risen to an average of about 50wt%. With \nfurther increase in hold time to 30 mins the levels drop again to about 11 or 12 wt%. The \n9wt% alloy sample gives a surface concentration of 17wt% at 5 mins holding in comparison \nwith about 8wt% (taking an average of three areas) for 5 mins with a 2 wt%Si sample. Note \nthat silicon is found at levels of a few wt% even though it is not present in the original alloy. \n \n \nAdherence of the Droplet to the SiC Surface \nDroplets of Al-2wt%Mg with contact times of 5, 15 and 30 minutes, and Al-9wt%Mg with 5 \nminutes contact time stayed adhering to the SiC surface whereas for the remaining samples \n(Al-9wt%Mg with 15, 30, 60 minutes contact time and Al-14wt%Mg  with 5, 15 and 60 \n minutes contact time) the droplet broke off during gentle handling. For the Al-14wt%Mg \nsamples the droplet in fact breaks off in two pieces, an overlying droplet and then a \u2018flake\u2019 \nwhich was situated between the droplet and the substrate and which corresponds in shape to \nthe \u2018crater\u2019 which forms on the surface of the substrate (i.e. it could be fitted back into the \ncrater).  \n \nThe 2wt% Mg alloy droplets showed very clear \u2018haloes\u2019 on the SiC surface in the immediate \nvicinity of the drop (see Fig. 6).  \n \nThere is some evidence of a halo for 5 minutes contact time for the 9 wt% Mg droplet. At 15 \nminutes and 30 minutes the region around the droplet simply appears dark (rather than shiny) \nin the stereomicroscope. For 60 minutes, a \u2018zone\u2019 of some kind is evident. For the 14 wt% Mg \ndroplet, no interference film colours are visible. At 5 minutes, there is a dark \u2018reaction zone\u2019. \nWith the 15 minute sample, the whole surface appears dark, with similar behaviour for 60 \nminutes. The samples were examined by using Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron \nMicroscope (FEGSEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) analysis in the \u2018halo\u2019 region. \nThe haloes were apparently due to very thin interference films. Therefore, the voltage of the \nelectron beam was reduced to decrease the penetration depth. The EDX was carried out at \n10keV. (When the voltage was dropped from 15keV to 10 keV, the percentage of magnesium \nin the EDX result increased significantly, suggesting it is concentrated in the surface film and \ntherefore that 10keV is an appropriate analysis voltage). The EDX analysis is for a small \nsquare rather than a point.  \n \n Table 2 gives the EDX results for the halo region. Note that carbon will be present because the \nsubstrate is SiC but it is not included in the analysis. \n \nMg generally increases as the distance from the edge of the droplet increases (with one \nexception \u2013 one of the two radial positions analysed for 2wt%Mg 15mins 750\u02daC). The levels \nare high (and in some cases very high \u2013 up to 97wt%) in comparison with the wt% of \nmagnesium in the droplet alloy. For the 9wt% and 14wt% Mg droplets the levels of \nmagnesium in the halo region are much lower than for the 2wt%Mg specimens. There is in \nsome cases a measurable amount (a few wt%) of Al in the halo region, generally decreasing \nwith distance from the edge of the droplet.  \n \nFor the 14wt%Mg 750\u02daC samples the droplet has detached leaving a crater (e.g. Fig. 7).  \nThe region on the edge of the crater was analysed in more detail for all three Al 14wt%Mg \nsamples (i.e. 5 mins, 15 mins and 60 mins hold at 750\u02daC). For the 5 mins. hold sample, the \nvalues for Mg and Al in the \u2018scalloped edge\u2019 are in some cases very high (e.g for one region \n19.2 wt% Mg and 80.3% wt% Al). In other parts of the scalloped edge, values are much lower \n(e.g. 0.5 wt% Mg and 2.4 wt% Al) but not zero. As the analysis moves outside the scalloped \nedge across the surface of the SiC at 10 micron intervals the values are typically tending \ntowards 1.1 wt% Mg and 0.7 wt% Al at 30 \u00b5m from the scalloped edge. For the 60 mins. hold \nsample this has increased to typically 2-3 wt% for both Mg and Al.  \n \nA flake of material has broken off from the base of the droplet. EDX results for the crater and \nfor the base of the detached flake give very high Si levels (approaching 100 wt.%). Some Al \nand Mg can be detected on the scalloped edge alongside the Si. The crater represents a region \n where the alloy droplet has reacted with the SiC substrate (the depth of the crater is about 1 \nmm). \n \nFor the sample which was prepared without quenching the halo still exists. It is less shiny than \nfor the as-quenched sample. \n \nScanning Electron Microscopy of Transverse Sections Through Droplets \nAfter the initial FEGSEM examinations of haloes and of droplet surfaces, the 14wt%Mg \ndroplets were sectioned perpendicular to the droplet\/SiC interface. Note that these droplets had \ndetached from the substrate. Fig. 8 shows a cross-section  for Al 14wt%Mg for 5 mins \nholding. The 5 mins and 60 mins samples in fact show non-wetting contact angles even though \nthe in situ contact angle measurements were less than 90\u02da (Fig. 3). This is thought to be due to \nshrinkage during solidification, with the triple point shrinking back from its position at \ntemperature. The figures in boxes on Fig. 8 are the EDX results for wt% Mg and Si raster \nanalyses (approximately 40 \u00b5m x 40 \u00b5m) at the positions shown. As far as possible porosity \nwas avoided. The balance is in each case Al. \n \nFor the 5 min hold sample (Fig. 8), the magnesium level is less than the original alloy level of \n14wt% except in two positions on the surface of the droplet. The concentration near the base \nof the droplet is decreasing. In the immediate vicinity of the base the Si level suddenly rises. \nThe interface at the base of the droplet is relatively flat suggesting that the droplet has broken \noff along a line corresponding to the original surface of the substrate whereas the \u2018flake\u2019 \nmentioned earlier (which has also broken off) is from beneath the droplet within a reaction \nzone in the SiC itself.  Si is present in some positions on the surface of the droplet. There is \n significant porosity, particularly in the surface regions, with what appear to be gas bubbles \nbreaking the surface. \n \nThe 40x40\u00b5m raster analyses were too coarse to examine phenomena near the triple point in \nthe corner of the droplets in detail. Point analyses were therefore carried out at 1\u00b5m, 4\u00b5m and \n8\u00b5m in from the corner (moving diagonally into the droplet). The results for the right hand \ncorner in Fig. 8 were, respectively, (with the balance Al):-  14.1 wt%Mg and 0.8 wt% Si; 14.5 \nwt% Mg and 0.8 wt% Si; 14.9 wt% Mg and 0.6 wt%Si. For the left hand corner the equivalent \nvalues are:- 27.5 wt% Mg and 16.1 wt%Si;  24.0 wt% Mg and 12.4 wt% Si; 19.0 wt% Mg and \n8.5 wt% Si. There is therefore significant evidence for the right hand corner (if not for the left \nhand corner) that Si has migrated into the droplet from the substrate and that Mg is \ncongregating in the corner. \n \nIn the 15 min sample , no silicon was detected. Mg levels are again lower than the original \nalloy composition of 14 wt% apart from the position at the very top of the droplet where the \nlevel is 19 wt% (higher than in the previous sample). There appears to be less porosity than in \nthe previous sample. The analysis near the triple point was again carried out in greater detail as \ndescribed for the 5 min. sample above. The results were similar to those for the left hand \ncorner of the 5 mins hold sample i.e. Mg levels close to the overall alloy composition of 14 wt \n% and Si levels at around 1 wt%.   \n  \nEvery Mg reading for the 60 mins hold sample is below the original level for the alloy. The \nsingle exception is a measurement taken actually within a hole to see if there is evidence that \nthe hole was formed by evaporation of Mg. The level of Mg in the hole is relatively high at \n 25wt%. There is evidence of Si within the hole and at one other position in the surface region. \nThere is some suggestion of Mg depletion on the sides of the droplet (typically 6 or 7wt%Mg) \nin comparison with the top of the droplet (12wt%). The detailed analysis near the triple point \nwas carried out as described for the 5 mins hold sample. The values were typically 7-10 wt% \nMg and 0.1 -0.6 wt% Si i.e. the Mg level is significantly lower than the original alloy \ncomposition.   The reading at the interface with the substrate and in the centre of the droplet is \nsimilar to the previous sample at 10 or 11 wt%. At what would have been the triple point it is \nnow 7 wt%Mg i.e. it has decreased from 10 wt%Mg between 15 mins and 60 mins. \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \n \nMechanism to Account for the Above Results \nFig. 9 shows a mechanism which might account for the  results.  \n \nThe Mg is either diffusing to the surface of the droplet and evaporating off or evaporating into \ngas bubbles rising within the droplet (there is some gas porosity in the transverse sections and \nan analysis in one of the holes showed relatively high Mg). The question is then whether the \nhalo region is forming by diffusion across the surface from the droplet or whether it is due to \ncondensation from the atmosphere. Condensation is unlikely because the drop and the \nsubstrate are at the same temperature. The Mg vapour pressure above the dilute solution would \nbe too low to lead to condensation of pure elemental Mg. This then leads to the possibility that \nthe haloes result from diffusion across the substrate surface. It might then be expected that the \nMg concentration on the surface of the substrate would be highest near the droplet. In fact, it \n increases with distance away from the droplet. However, this might be accounted for if the \nsupply of Mg is being inhibited by the progressive formation of an oxide\/spinel layer on the \ndroplet. Note that the haloes disappear with hold time at temperature almost certainly because \nthe surface layer is thickening (hence appearing darker) and hence the interference colours are \ndisappearing. \n \nMg is thought to promote wetting by reacting with oxygen in the silica on the surface of the \nSiC8. The diffusion of the Mg across the surface oxide layer on the SiC may then be \u2018paving \nthe way\u2019 for the advance of the wetting alloy. The argument against this is that it is actually \nthe high Mg droplets which give the lowest contact angle but these have the lowest Mg in the \nhalo region. Al may also be involved in the reaction (forming MgAl2O4) because both Mg and \nAl are found at low levels near to the triple point position on the surface of the SiC just outside \nthe scalloped edge of the crater for the 14 wt% Mg samples. The values for the Al and Mg \nincrease at 30 \u00b5m from the edge with hold time (comparing the 5 min sample with the 60 mins \nsample).  Mg does not form a carbide but may react with the SiC to form a silicide Mg2Si \n(\u0394G\u04e9= - 73.1 kJ\/mol43). In Fig. 9, Al is shown as diffusing from the droplet across the SiC \nsurface at the triple point because the levels of Al decrease with distance from the droplet \nas would be consistent with diffusion.  \n \nResidual oxygen in the system (as identified earlier) will tend to react with the surface of the \ndroplet giving either an Al2O3 surface film (for the low Mg content droplets), or MgO or the \nspinel MgAl2O4 (for the higher Mg content droplets). This would account for the darkening of \nthe surface of the droplet with time and with the higher Mg contents. The Al2O3 film in the \nearly stages of holding will tend not to be complete and therefore this might then explain why \n the Mg level is higher in the halo region for the 2 wt% Mg than for the higher Mg content \ndroplets. For longer holds with higher Mg contents, the surface of the droplet is darker and \n\u2018crusty\u2019, suggesting there is a thicker film which may be inhibiting the evaporation of Mg \nfrom the surface. \n  \nWhat is clear is that with increasing Mg concentration in the original droplet and increasing \nhold time at temperature, extensive reaction is occurring at the interface between the droplet \nand the SiC. It is likely that the reactions include: \n4Al + 3SiC \u2192Al4C3 + 3Si            \u0394G\u04e9 = -88.5 kJ\/mol1. \nThe free Si is then transferring into the droplet (and is hence detected in the EDX analysis of \nthe cross-section) and the formation of the brittle Al4C3 (although it has not been possible here \nto prove that Al4C3 is present) leads to the detachment of the droplet from the substrate. If the \nreaction is extensive, the flake forms. The Si now dissolved in the droplet can form Mg2Si \n(and indeed this precipitate will form even with low quantities of Mg and Si present in the \nalloy provided there is a stiochiometric balance of Mg and Si (the stiochiometric ratio of \nMg:Si is 1.73:1)44 then the excess Si beyond that soluble in the Al will either precipitate as Si \nparticles or diffuse to the surface of the droplet. Wetting is only achieved for the 9 and 14 wt% \nMg samples and therefore there is an intimate connection between this interfacial reaction and \nthe wetting. Note that the spreading kinetics are significantly faster than when no Mg is \npresent.26 \n \nContact Angle \n Although the addition of 2 or 4-wt%Mg reduced the contact angle of aluminium, the non-\nwetting condition was still present in these alloy\/SiC systems (i.e \u03b8>90\u00b0). The wetting \ncondition (i.e \u03b8<90\u00b0) was achieved only for 9 and 14-wt%Mg additions in the present work. \n \nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  \nThe wetting of SiC by aluminium-magnesium alloys has been investigated with a sessile drop \napparatus that strips the surface oxide from the molten alloy droplet so that, at least at the \ninstant of initial contact, it is not interfering with the measurements. The measurements have \nbeen carried out at 750\u02daC for times up to 60 minutes and for alloys ranging in magnesium \ncontent from 2 wt% to 14 wt%. A mechanism has been proposed to account for the results as \nfollows: \n \n1) Immediately on contact with the substrate, magnesium in the droplet is migrating to the \nsurface of the droplet including evaporating into bubbles which rise to the surface of \nthe droplet. Magnesium is likely to be evaporating from the surface of the droplet.  \n2) There may be some diffusion of Al and Mg from the triple point across the surface of \nthe SiC in the immediate vicinity of the droplet and this may be contributing to the \nwetting. \n3) A wetting contact angle is only achieved for the higher Mg contents (9 and 14 wt%) \nand for these samples extensive reaction is occurring at the interface with the SiC (to a \ndepth of ~1mm for the most extreme case). The droplet then has a brittle interface with \nthe substrate and easily breaks off.  \n \n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank Mr Graham Clark at Leicester University for assistance with \nspecimen preparation and Scanning Electron Microscopy. \n \nREFERENCES  \n1.
