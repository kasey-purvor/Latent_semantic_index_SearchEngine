The force fields were evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations at 10 K (which is akin to potential energy minimization) with the simulation cell lengths and angles free to evolve. Both force fields performed relatively poorly, not being able to simultaneously reproduce all of the crystal structures within a 5% deviation level. The parameter sets were then systematically optimized using sensitivity analysis, and a revised AMBER95 set was found to reproduce the crystal structures with less than 5% deviation from experiment.
