Making a \nfilm with 1\u00b5m thick needs more than 10 times coating cycles, which is sometimes unacceptable. In \nthis study, a sol modified with an additive was used for the preparation of thick PZT films. The \nthickness of the films depends upon the rotation rate. Up to 700 nm crack-free single layers could \nbe obtained. The deposited films crystallised as the perovskite structure on platinum-buffered \nsilicon by heating at 550 \u00baC. The porosity of the thick films was a function of the single layer \nthickness. A dense PZT film with a single layer 140nm thick was found to have a very high \npyroelectric coefficient (p=2.36 x 10-4 CK-1m-2) and figure of merit (1.88 x 10-5 Pa-0.5). The \nintroduction of pores in the films reduced p. However, the figure of merit of the films exhibited a \nreasonably high value due to a dramatic reduction of dielectric constant.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn recent years, the use of ferroelectric thin films of PbZrxTi1-xO3 (PZT) family for memory, \npiezoelectric and pyroelectric devices has drawn considerable interest [1]. Deposition of PZT films \non silicon substrates has been extensively investigated in thin-film form (thickness less than 1 \u00b5m). \nHowever, the needs of PZT materials in thick-film form (thickness 1-50 \u00b5m) are expanding for \napplications in microactuators in order to produce large piezoelectric displacements and generative \nforces. The advantage of film devices over bulk materials is that they can be directly deposited on \nplatinised silicon to allow direct integration with electronics.  \nThe sol-gel process used to deposit PZT films on substrates has been considered as one of \nthe best methods due to its low processing temperature, precise control of composition and low \ncost. However, one of the drawbacks in the use of sol-gel process is its limit of single layer \nthickness. The thickness of a single sol-gel layer usually falls in the range of less than 0.1 \u00b5m. \nDeposition of thicker layers than this usually results in cracks and \/or formation of porosity. The \nrequired thickness is achieved by repeating the coating and heat treatment, which produces a \nsequence of thin layers free from cracking. Such repetitive coatings, however, may not be realistic \nin the production of coating films in industry. The limited thickness achievable without crack \nformation is one of the factors that discourages application of the sol-gel technique to industrial \nproduction of ceramic coatings. The origins of cracks are widely thought to come from two sources: \nthe shrinkage during the crystallisation anneals in the sol-gel processing, and the thermal mismatch \nbetween the film and the substrate.  \nMany efforts have been made to prepare crack-free, thick, ceramic coating films from gels \n[2-7]. The largest single layer thickness has been reported to be 1.7\u00b5m [7]. However, all these thick \nfilms contain, more or less, some porosity, which will reduce the piezoelectric and ferroelectric \nproperties.  \nThe pyroelectric properties of sol-gel PZT thin films (\u2264 1\u00b5m) reported in the literature so far \nare based on samples with a single layer thickness of less than 0.1\u00b5m, which tends to produce dense \nfilms. To our knowledge, the pyroelectric properties of dense sol-gel PZT films with a single layer \nthicker than 0.1\u00b5m have not been reported. \nMost recently, Suyal et al [8] added polymer into PZT precursor sol prior to spin coating to \nprepare porous PZT films (the porosity is in the range of 20-25%). Introduction of pores creates a \nmatrix void composite resulting in the increase of figures of merit for pyroelectric applications.  \nThe purposes of the work described in the present paper are dual, first to prepare a dense \ncrack-free thicker film ( > 0.1 \u00b5m of a single layer) and compare its pyroelectric properties with a \ndense thin film (<0.1 \u00b5m of a single layer) and second to prepare thicker films (\u22650.35\u00b5m of a single \nlayer) in the hope of improving the figures of merit of these pyroelectric films by introducing a \nporous microstructure, which largely reduces the dielectric permitivity of the materials (figures of \nmerit, Fd = p\/c\u2032(\u03b5r\u03b50tan\u03b4)1\/2 ) and compare its pyroelectric properties with those obtained with dense \nfilms. \n \nExperimental \nPb(OOCCH3)2.3H2O was dissolved in CH3OH with heating. Ti(OnBu)4 and Zr(OnPr)4.PrnOH was \nmixed together and dissolved in a mixed solution of CH3COOH and MeOH. The molar ratio of \nZr\/Ti was equal to 30\/70. Two solutions were then mixed together and refluxed for 2h. Pb excess \nwas fixed at 10% extra. This was for the compensation of Pb loss later during heat treatment of \nfilms. The concentration of the solution was 0.4M based on Pb. This sol (Solution A) was used for \nmaking layers less than 150nm each layer. To make films with thicker layers, this solution was then \nconcentrated to 1M by distillation. A small amount of organic additives was then added to the \nconcentrated solution to increase the viscosity and avoid the creation of cracks in the preparation of \nthick films. Distilled water was added to the PZT precursor solution with the ratio of PZT solution \nto water, 10 : 1 v\/v. The resultant solution (Solution B) was aged at room temperature for 24h prior \nto use.  \nThe films were fabricated by applying sols onto Pt(111)\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si(100) substrates \n(thickness Pt\/Ti\/SiO2 = 100\/5\/500 nm) by spin coating with a photo resist spinner (Model 1-\nEC101D-R790, Headway Research Inc) at various spin rates depending on the required thickness. \nEach wet layer was initially dried at 150 \u00b0C to evaporate the solvent, rapidly heated to 400\u00baC to \nremove residual organics, and annealed at 550 \u00b0C to densify the layer and prevent further shrinkage.  \nThe orientation of the film was determined by the standard \u03b8-2\u03b8 X-ray diffraction (XRD) method \non a Siemens D5005 diffractometer using CuK\u03b1 radiation and a Goebel mirror. The cross-section \nmorphology of the films was observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Philips XL30, \nSFEG). On selected films, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Philips CM20 was used. The \nTEM cross-section samples were prepared using a focused ion beam system (FEI FIB200). For the \nmeasurement of electrical properties, a set of Au\/Cr electrode dots was sputtered onto the film \nsurface through a photoresist mask obtained by photolithography.  The exposed Pt bottom electrode \nbeneath the film provided the other electrode. Film thickness was determined from a Dektak surface \nprofilometer, and compared against values taken from SEM or TEM cross-section images. The \ndielectric constant and loss tangent of the PZT films as a function of frequency (33Hz to 1kHz) \nwere measured using a Genrad 1689M RLC Digibridge impedance analyzer. The polarisation \nhysteresis loops of PZT porous thick films showed that the porous PZT is very hard to pole as \ncompared to dense PZT films and a relatively high poling field is needed for the poling of porous \nthick films. A dense thin film (700nm) could be fully poled at 20V at 130 \u00baC for 10 min, while a \nporous thick film (700nm) needed almost a double voltage to reach a saturated polarisation at the \nsame temperature and the length of poling time. The films used in this paper for pyroelectric and \nhysteresis loop measurements were poled by the corona method at 130\u00baC at 25 kV for 5min. After \npoling, the films were discharged by connecting the top electrode and bottom electrode. The \npyroelectric coefficient was measured using the Byer-Roundy method [9] for which the detailed \nprocedure was described in Ref. [10]. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nThe SEM micrographs of thick films synthesised by Solution B are shown in Fig.1. Through the \ncontrol of spinning rate, films with different thicknesses were obtained. A film (Fig. 1(a)) with 2 \nlayers obtained at 1000 rpm is 1.4 \u00b5 thick and a film (Fig.1 (b)) at 2000 rpm with 3 layers is 1.5 \u00b5 \nthick. It can be clearly seen that there are many pores randomly distributed through the thickness of \nthe film. However, it has been observed that there are not any cracks in the films with the single-\nlayer thickness up to 700nm. The thicker films could be built up by repeating the above deposition \nprocess. The porosity of the films can be observed from TEM and SEM images. Unlike the thin \nfilms of PZT, XRD patterns (not showing here) of these thick films show a random orientation, \nindicating that the mechanism of nucleation and growth of these thick films is different from the \nthin films [12]. \nThe success of the preparation of crack-free thick films and introduction of pores into the \nPZT films makes it possible to examine the concept that the porous PZT films can actually have a \nhigher figure of merit through lowering the permittivity without a sacrifice in pyroelectric \ncoefficient (p). To compare the electric properties of thick films to those of thin films, three \nsamples, all 700nm thick, were prepared with various single-layer thicknesses. Table 1 lists these \nsamples and their processing conditions. \nFig. 2 shows the TEM and SEM cross-section images of these films. For the films PZT70 \nand PZT140, columnar structure with well-defined grains can be clearly observed. These two films \nare very dense and closely packed. For the film PZT350, the TEM cross-section does not show a \ncolumnar structure. Although no cracks are observed, there is a small amount of pores randomly \ndistributed in the film.  \nX-ray diffraction patterns of these samples are shown in Fig. 3. This figure clearly shows \nthat all the films have a perovskite structure after being annealed at 550 \u00baC. No second phase \npyrochlore was observed which indicates that given the same length of time at 550 \u00baC, the thicker \nlayer film (350 nm per layer) can also crystallise into perovskite. The x-ray diffraction patterns \ntaken from the samples PZT70 and PZT140, derived from Solution A, demonstrates a strong (111) \nreflection while the sample, PZT350, derived from Solution B, a random reflection. These \nobservations confirm that the films made from thick single layers have no preferred orientation. In \nour earlier works [12] about the mechanism of the crystallisation and orientation of the PZT thin \nfilms, we had found that the formation of PZT [111] orientation is due to a close lattice match \nbetween a Pt3Pb intermetallic phase and PZT [111], which favours a preferred orientation. \nHowever, in the case of thick single layer films (PZT350), the mechanism has become more \ncomplicated. The thicker single layer decreases the influence of the Pt bottom electrode on the \nnucleation and preferred orientation of the deposited PZT film. Nucleation also occurs at other sites \nat the surface and in the bulk of the film [13], which produces crystallites whose orientations are not \nconstrained by the Pt orientation. The intensity I111\/(I111 + I110) through deconvolution decreased \nfrom 0.92 in the sample PZT140 to 0.15 in the sample PZT350, indicating the decline in 111 \npreferred orientation. The corresponding ratio for powder prepared from bulk gels was ~0.15, which \nshows that there was still a considerable degree of orientation in the sample PZT350. \nTable 2 shows the electrical properties of the PZT 30\/70 films with different single-layer \nthickness. Dielectric constant largely decreases from 372 in the dense film (PZT70) to 210 in the \nporous film (PZT350). It was observed that the porous film (PZT350) has a lower pyrocoefficient \n(1.60 x 10-4 CK-1m-2 ) compared to the dense films (PZT70 2.11 x 10-4 CK-1m-2 and  PZT140 2.36 x \n10-4 CK-1m-2). This behavior may be due to the fact that the films with porosity have a reduced \ncharge density and hence a reduced pyrocoefficient. The reduction in pyrocoefficient in the film \nwith porosity was in agreement with the observation in Ref [8]. It must be noticed that PZT140 has \na higher pyrocoefficient than PZT70, indicating that increasing a single layer thickness from 70nm \nto 140nm increases the pyrocoefficient. There are many possible explanations for these \nobservations, for example, PZT thin films have been reported to have composition variations in the \ncrystallisation interface [14-15]. Thicker single layer may help reducing such variations in the film \nstoichiometry or microstructural inhomogenities. The pyrocoefficient of dense thick film is one of \nthe highest values reported for PZT films prepared on silicon substrate. The figure-of-merits Fd of \nthree samples have been calculated using Fd = p\/c\u2032(\u03b5r\u03b50tan\u03b4)1\/2 and c\u2032 value of 2.5 x 106 J m-3 K-1 \nknown for PZT ceramics [11]. The thicker dense film (PZT140) almost has a double Fd value (1.88 \nx 10-5 Pa-0.5) compared to the thin dense film (PZT70)(1.07 x 10-5 Pa-0.5). The figure of merit of the \nporous thicker film (PZT350)(1.50 x 10-5 Pa-0.5) has shown a much higher value than the dense thin \nfilm (PZT70) due to a dramatic decrease of dielectric constant.  \nFig. 4 shows the hysteresis loops of the PZT70, PZT140 and PZT350 films. The P-E \nhysteresis loops show that the remnant polarisation of the porous film (PZT350) is not as large as \nthe dense films. The reason for poor ferroelectric properties is the porous nature of the film, leading \nto a large leakage current. The hysteresis loop of the porous thick film (PZT350) shifts to the \npositive field, called the \u2018imprint\u2019 phenomenon, and indicates the magnitude of internal bias field, \nwhich is proportional to the polarisation. With the increase of the densification of the films, the \nsymmetry of the hysteresis loops improves, indicating that the internal bias fields decrease. It is \nimplied that the PZT porous thin films may possess less spontaneous polarisation responses. \nTherefore, they are probably less suitable for the piezo- or ferro-applications.  \n \nConclusions \n(1) Dense crack- and pore-free PZT thick films (single layer thickness =140 nm) have successfully \nprepared by adjusting the spinning rate of deposition.  \n(2) Through incorporating an additive to the precursor solution, the thickness of a single layer \nwithout cracks can be up to 700 nm. However, These films are porous and their porosity is a \nfunction of single-layer thickness.  \n(3) The films prepared with thicker single layers (140nm per layer) have showed a higher \npyroelectric coefficient (p) and figure-of-merit (FD) compared to the films prepared with thinner \nsingle layers (70nm per layer) or with porous microstructure thick layers.  \n(4) The films prepared with thicker layers (350nm \/per layer) possessed a certain amount of \nporosity. The permittivity of such a film was largely reduced (almost one half of dense films) \ndue to the existence of pores. However, their pyroelectric coefficients remained relatively high \nso that their figures-of-merit were also relatively high compared to the films prepared by thin \ndense layers (<100nm \/per layer).  \n \n \nReferences \n[1] D.R.
