Introduction  \nSome time ago Veselago [1] observed that in a uniform material characterised by both \nnegative permittivity and permeability the Poynting vector of an electromagnetic (EM) wave \nin the medium is antiparallel to its wavevector, giving rise to interesting effects such as \nnegative refraction. More recently, the realisation of such effects has been investigated by \nemploying non-uniform metamaterial structures. Although much work has been centred upon \nattempts to achieve negative permittivity and permeability simultaneously, this is not in fact a \nnecessary condition to observe negative refraction in photonic structures. Indeed, Luo, et al., \n[2] demonstrated theoretically that negative refraction could be achieved via the lowest \nphotonic band of a dielectric structure possessing neither a negative refractive index nor a \nnegative group velocity for EM waves. Others such as Ozbay, et al., [3] have succeeded in the \nexperimental observation of negative refraction in the microwave regime. Hence, negative \nrefraction is a well established concept and the focus is now increasingly on the utilization \nrather than the demonstration of the effect. For example Wu, et al., [4] have employed a \npolymer-dispersed liquid crystal photonic structure to obtain angle-dependent switching in the \nvisible region, and Wang, et al., [5] have demonstrated beam steering using a prism formed \n#92900 - $15.00 USD Received 19 Feb 2008; revised 2 May 2008; accepted 2 May 2008; published 6 May 2008\n(C) 2008 OSA 12 May 2008 \/ Vol. 16,  No. 10 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  7330\nBand 2\nfX \n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nBand 1\nfJ\nX\u0393J\nf, T\nH\nz\nfrom microwave frequency resonators\/varactors. In recent work we have theoretically and \nexperimentally demonstrated the use of photonic structures consisting of finite two-\ndimensional (2-D) square arrays of metallic pillars to achieve filtering of radiation in the \nterahertz frequency regime [6, 7]. The initial work was extended, to achieve a narrowing of \nthe pass-band by using a dual array structure involving two arrays of the same period but \ndifferent pillar diameters [8]. Only normal incidence was considered in that work. Here we \ntheoretically demonstrate another approach which considers oblique incidence and utilizes the \ndistinction between positive and negative refraction in a prism-like 2-D hexagonal metallic \npillar array structure to achieve the THz filter properties. In this case the properties of the \nfilter naturally depend on the parameters of the structure, but are also in principle tunable to \nsome extent by varying the angle of incidence.   \n2. Results and discussion \nFigure 1 shows the dispersion relation with the electric field, E, polarised parallel to the pillars \nin a hexagonal metallic photonic crystal (PC) with lattice constant a = 200 \u03bcm formed by  \ngold pillars with diameter d = 80 \u03bcm. The results were obtained using a hexagonal structure \nversion of the complex bandstructure calculations described elsewhere [6].

In PCs at low frequency, the shape of the 2-D equifrequency \nsurface (EFS) is nearly circular, but in general, the bands are more complicated. It is \nsignificant that for this system the light-line lies entirely outside the region shown and \ntherefore all photonic bands are in principle accessible to experimental investigation. For \nexample, at the J point the frequency in the photonic crystal is fJ = 1.28 THz whereas the \ncorresponding frequency in the vacuum is 1 THz. \nThe group velocity of the Bloch wave is defined as vg= k\u03c9\u2207  and for the symmetry \ndirections \u0393 - X and  \u0393 - J this is along the same axis as the wavevector, and we have that the \ngroup velocity is a scalar, vg = \u2202\u03c9\/\u2202k .  However, the group velocity is parallel to the \nwavevector in band 1 whereas it is anti-parallel for band 2, and this is crucial to the operation \nof the proposed filter. The direction of propagation in the medium is defined by the frequency, \nand the matching of the components of the wavevector parallel to the interface, k\n\u03c4\n, for the \nincident and refracted waves, and the requirement that vg for the transmitted wave is \npropagating into the medium.  In the case of a standard uniform isotropic medium, the EFS is \na sphere, and matching of the component of the wavevector of an incident wave parallel to the   \ninterface leads to Snell's law and conventional positive refraction. Now consider a wave \nincident at angle \u03b1 from a vacuum onto a PC, at a frequency which is within band 1 where the \n#92900 - $15.00 USD Received 19 Feb 2008; revised 2 May 2008; accepted 2 May 2008; published 6 May 2008\n(C) 2008 OSA 12 May 2008 \/ Vol. 16,  No. 10 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  7331\n(a) (b)\nk\n\u03c4\nvg\nX J\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\nk\n\u03c4\nX J\nvg\nk\n\u03c4\n \nk\n\u03c4\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\nEFS is near-isotropic and  vg is essentially in the same direction as the wavevector. The \nrespective magnitudes of the wavevectors in the vacuum and PC are kvacuum and kPC \nrespectively and the angle of refraction is denoted by \u03b2. Therefore we have                                       \nkvacuum sin \u03b1 = kPC sin \u03b2 = k\u03c4  as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). In this particular case ,  f = 1.136 THz \nand \u03b1  = 20\u00b0. Since for this band vg is parallel to the wavevector positive refraction occurs. In  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2. The arrows indicate the wavevectors of the incident radiation (at angle \u03b1), the \ncorresponding wavevectors in the photonic crystal (at angle \u03b2), and their component parallel to \nthe interface (k\n\u03c4\n ). The hexagon denotes the first Brillouin zone in the photonic crystal. (a) At \nfrequency, f = 1.136 THz, within band 1 part of the near-isotropic equifrequency surface (EFS) \nin the photonic crystal  and the spherical EFS in  the vacuum (upper half-space) are shown. The \ngroup velocity in the photonic crystal is in the same direction as the wavevector. In (b) in band \n2 with f = 1.344 THz  the EFS in the photonic crystal bandstructure is anisotropic and vg is in \nthe direction of the dashed arrow, giving negative refraction. \n \ncontrast, at frequency  f = 1.344 THz, which lies within band 2 with fJ < f < fX, we find that \nthe matching of  k\n\u03c4  \ntogether with  the requirement that the transmitted wave is propagating \naway from the interface leads to the situation shown in Fig. 2(b). This corresponds to negative \nrefraction. As a check on the calculations, we note that when the time-averaged Poynting \nvector is averaged over a unit cell of the structure, this gives a result in the same direction as \nthe group velocity, as expected. The form of  the bandstructure in Fig. 1 suggests that the \nonset of negative refraction should occur when  f = fJ = 1.28 THz for which the transmitted \nwave and group velocity will be in a \u0393-J direction with \u03b2 = 30\u00b0. As k\n\u03c4\n= (2\u03c0\/a)\/3 at this point \nin the Brillouin zone, we can obtain \u03b1 from the expression \n1\nsin sin sin .\n3vacuum PC J\nck k k f a\u03c4 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b1\n\u239b \u239e\n= = \u21d2 =\n\u239c \u239f\n\u239d \u23a0\n \n  The minimum angle consistent with negative refraction via band 2 corresponds to \u03b1 = \n23\u00b0. At higher frequencies, as can be seen in the equifrequency plot in Fig. 3, the EFS of band \n2 becomes essentially circular.  With fixed \u03b1 and the magnitude of the wavevector reducing in \nthe PC as the frequency increases,  there is an upper cutoff frequency above which matching \nof k\n\u03c4\n can no longer be achieved at any angle, \u03b2, and hence negative refraction is suppressed. \nUsing \u03b1 = 23\u00b0 the cutoff frequency is 1.48 THz (at which point the tangential component of \nthe wavevector has increased from 0.33 to 0.38 in units of 2\u03c0\/a), well below the band 2 \nmaximum frequency of about 1.76 THz. As \u03b1 is increased, the cutoff frequency is reduced. \nThese results suggest that it should in principle be possible to channel the incident radiation \ninto either positively or negatively refracted beams, depending on frequency, and further, that \nthe width of the resultant pass-bands can, to some extent, be adjusted. When \u03b1 = 23\u00b0 the \nbandstructure calculations suggest that positive refraction should be possible for frequencies  \n#92900 - $15.00 USD Received 19 Feb 2008; revised 2 May 2008; accepted 2 May 2008; published 6 May 2008\n(C) 2008 OSA 12 May 2008 \/ Vol. 16,  No. 10 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  7332\nPRF\nNRF\nIF\nSOURCE\n(a)\nPRF\nNRF\nIF\nSOURCE\n(b)\n \nFig. 3.

The flux is \ncalculated at the respective exit surfaces of the prism. \n \nThe features of the wave propagation through the PC prism suggest that such structures \ncould be used as pass-band filters. In practice, the transmission spectrum is dependent upon \nthe angle of incidence and the prism size and geometry, features which can be adjusted to \nprovide an optimised transmission for a particular application. In Fig. 4(b) the angle and \nfrequency have been chosen in order to maximise the transmission and the angle of deviation \nof the negatively refracted beam but significant transmission is observable over a range of \nincident angles from about 10 - 25\u00b0.  Figure 6 shows the location of the PRF and NRF bands \nas a function of \u03b1. It can there be seen that the positions and widths of the transmission bands \ncan be adjusted to some extent by varying \u03b1. The frequency of the PRF band increases and the \nfrequency of the NRF band decreases with increasing angle. Outside the considered interval \nof angles, there is no well defined single pass-band, internal reflection in the prism increases \nand both PRF and NRF beam intensities become comparable. In this figure the band width \nand therefore the gap between the bands, has been defined via the half-width of the respective \nbands. Consequently, we cannot directly compare the positions of the edges with those of the \nbandstructure calculations, which are defined via the absolute edges of the respective bands. \nHowever, we note that the mid-point between the PRF and NRF bands suggests that fJ = 1.25 \nTHz, in good agreement with the bandstructure results.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6.
