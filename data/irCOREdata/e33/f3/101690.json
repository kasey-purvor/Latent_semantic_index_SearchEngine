ICT strategic implications for business and the travel industry in particular \n \nInformation technology generates fundamental changes in the nature and application of \ntechnology in business. Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) can provide powerful \nstrategic and tactical tools for organisations, which, if properly applied and used, could bring great \nadvantages in promoting and strengthening their competitiveness [63,64]. The proliferation of the \nInternet, as a main stream communication media and as an infostructure for business transactions \nhas generated a wide range of strategic implications for businesses in general as well as for the \ntravel and airline industries in particular.  \n \n1.1 ICTs revolutionised business processes and practices \n \nThe recent ICT developments have enormous implications for the operation, structure. and \nstrategy of organisations. The competitiveness of future economies will, to a great extent, depend \nboth on the development and application of these technologies. The proliferation of the World \nWide Web forced most organisations to rethink the way they do business and how they can \nreengineer their business processes. As businesses can interact more efficiently, competent \nbusinesses became digital and networked, facing a whole range of fresh opportunities and \nchallenges [75,76,77]. The eCommerce revolution is evident on a global basis, although the level \nof success often depends on a wide range of local factors [66]. Porter [65] illustrates that \nultimately technology can totally transform the way an entire business is done.  \n \nICTs contribute towards efficiency, productivity. and competitiveness improvements of both inter-\norganisational and intra-organisational systems. The relationship between ICTs and competitive \nadvantage and performance is still unclear [14,19]. Although there is an indirect and complex \ncasual relationship between ICTs and profitability, it is difficult to be quantified and generalised. \nThere is evidence, however, that well\u2013managed ICTs can generate tremendous value for \norganisations [48]. Technology has already revolutionised a wide range of functions including \nbusiness functions [73], external environment monitoring [86], communicating with partners and \nwith consumers at large. Clear strategic goals and commitment are prerequisites for the \ndevelopment of an appropriate eCommerce strategy and the development of web sites and other \ntechnological solutions [46]. The emergent mobile technologies and mobile commerce are \nexpected to change drastically a number of industries and to force organisations to reconsider \ntheir strategic management [5]. \n \n1.2 ICTs in the travel and tourism industries \n \nThe travel industry already uses a wide range of ICT systems [62,82,69,9]. The Internet in \nparticular allows them to demonstrate their competencies widely as well as to communicate \ndirectly with their prospective customers. Increasingly, intranets are used to offer user-friendly \naccess to employees of organisations, as well as extranets which provide authorised partners with \nthe ability to use company data to transact online. In addition, several internal-management \napplications facilitate the strategic and operational management and marketing of travel \norganisations.  \n \nICTs support all business functions and are critical for operating in the travel industry as a whole. \nFew other industries rely on so many partners to collaborate closely for delivering their products \nand few other value chains are as elaborate as the one for travel [8]. ICTs provide the tools to \nsearch for meaningful and profitable niche market segments, to identify value added components \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     4\nfor the product and to promote differentiated products through specialised media to particular \nmarket segments. Cost effectiveness and flexibility are critical assets contributed by ICTs in this \nprocess, as they assist cost reductions and maximise efficiency. The influence of ICTs on travel \norganisations is pervasive, as information is critical for both day-to-day operations as well as the \nstrategic management of organisations. On the strategic level, travel organisations have to \ncontinuously assess all elements of their external environment, as well as their competition and \ncustomer needs, and consequently, adapt themselves in order to enhance their competitiveness. \nUsing ICTs, tourism organisations can differentiate their product customising the final product and \nadding value according to individual requirements. \n \nICTs support the strategic management of travel organisations by empowering long-term decision \nmaking and by providing a platform for collaboration and transactions between partners. They also \nhelp the entire industry to operate by empowering internal processes, co-ordinating partners, as \nwell as by interacting with prospective travellers and the general public. As a result, the recent ICT \ndevelopments have revolutionised the entire system and have profound implications for both the \nstrategic and tactical management of travel organisations. More importantly they have dramatically \nchanged the industry structure and altered the competitiveness of all players in the marketplace \n[9,61].  \n \n1.3 ICTs in airlines : Research Objectives  \n \nThis paper analyses the use of ICTs in airlines as part of the travel industry. It aims to explore the \nrole of ICTs in the contemporary airline industry and to investigate the strategic and tactical tools \ncurrently utilised. It focuses on the generic strategic and operational management of airlines and \nidentifies some of the most critical ICT issues that will affect the future competitiveness of carriers. \n \nThere are a number of different types of passenger airlines, including: \n\u2022 Scheduled (often flag carriers) such as British Airways or United Airlines \n\u2022 No\u2013frills (or low cost) carriers, such as Easyjet, Ryanair and South West Airlines \n\u2022 Charter airlines, such as Britannia Airways and Hapag-Lloyd Flug, carrying Tour Operator\u2019s \ncustomers to resorts [84]. \n \nThis paper primarily concentrates on scheduled and no-frills airlines, as charter airlines use \ndifferent distribution mechanisms to display their availability and prices. However, the distinction \nbetween these types of airlines is increasingly becoming unclear, as each type of carrier is trying \nto enter each other\u2019s market. However, no-frills airlines as new entrants have been much more \ntechnologically innovative, and these innovations are identified in the analysis. \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     5\n2. Historical developments and the use of ICTs in the airline industry \n \nAirlines are advanced users of ICTs and a number of airline functions rely heavily on ICTs [12,23, \n36,24,11,22,78]. Distribution and collaboration with partners is perhaps one of the most critical \nareas of ICT contribution [70,25,39,13]. Many low-cost carriers rely exclusively on ICTs for \ndisplaying their availability and for communicating and transacting with their clientele. ICTs are \nequally important in operations management and contribute to the optimisation of procedures and \nprocesses [40,87,88,18] as well as for softer service elements such as in-flight entertainment and \ncustomer service [2]. \n \nAirlines have been investing heavily in ICTs since the 1950s. They have pioneered the introduction of \nICTs as they realised, fairly early, the need for efficient, quick, inexpensive, and accurate handling of \ntheir inventory to communicate with travel agencies and other distributors. Carriers appreciated that \nreservations could no longer be on manual display boards, where passengers were listed, as they \nexpanded their fleet and routes. Up to the 1970s, most travel agencies had to locate the best routes \nand fares for their customers in a manual (such as the Official Airline Guide and the World Airways \nGuide ABC). They then had to phone for availability, reservation and confirmation before issuing a \nticket manually.  \n \nIn 1962, American Airlines introduced its SABRE Computer Reservation System (CRS) as an \nalternative to expanding its Boeing 707 fleet by 50%, (from 8 to 12 aircrafts). The project was then \ndescribed as \"a technical marvel representing a programming task that surpassed the coding effort \nrequired for NASA's Project Mercury\" [27]. By the mid-1970s SABRE was much more than an \ninventory-control system. Its technology provided the base for generating flight plans for aircraft, \ntracking spare parts, scheduling crews and developing a range of decision support systems for \nmanagement [15, 44]. Ever since, every single airline has developed, purchased or leased a similar \nsystem in order to satisfy similar needs. \n \nIn the 1970s, the USA air transportation deregulation enabled airlines to change their routes and \nfares as frequently as desired. This generated an enormous growth of air traffic as well as a greater \ndemand for information [28,83]. Hence, the demand for efficient and effective internal and external \ncommunication with all airline stakeholders stimulated the development of CRS as central planning \nadministration and commerce platforms for airlines. CRSs allowed airlines to improve their internal \norganisation and also provided a powerful tool to manage their inventory. They also enabled airlines \nto communicate with travel agencies, consolidators and other distributors and to update routes, \navailability, and prices constantly. Following the deregulation, \"fare wars\" multiplied the fares \nstructure and increased the computing and communication needs. Carriers used the newly emerging \ncomputer technology to manage reservations and fare data more accurately and efficiently. The \nsophistication of CRSs expanded in order to distribute up to date information to all potential \ncustomers world-wide and to support the operation and administration of airlines. In addition, CRSs \nallowed airlines to compete fiercely by constantly adapting their schedule and fares to demand. CRSs \nwere effectively developed to marketing and distribution systems and contributed significantly to the \ncompetitiveness of vendor\/host airlines [79,6]. \n \nGradually CRSs became strategic business units (SBU) in their own right, due to their ability to \ngenerate income and boost airlines' sales at the expense of their competitors [16]. CRSs introduced \nthree major financial benefits for vendor airlines, namely: a wide distribution network and CRS \nservices; revenues generated from services to third parties, and incremental benefits through \ndirectional selling to the parent carrier [72,49,17, 80]. Fare wars complicated the fares structure \nand increased the computing and communication needs. Most major CRSs installed terminals in travel \nagencies to assist remote printing of travel documents such as tickets and boarding passes, itineraries \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     6\nand invoices. They also improved the efficiency in arranging sales settlements between airlines and \ntravel agencies, and empowered frequent flyer programmes. Eventually, every airline developed or \npurchased its own system, which was run domestically and primarily served its national market \n[53,81]. \n \nIn the mid-1980s, airline and CRS executives realised that air transportation was a fairly small part \nof a much more complex travelling experience. Travel agencies were demanding access to a number \nof carriers from a single terminal, as well as information on value-added products at destinations. \nCRSs therefore were developed to much more comprehensive Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) \nto offer a wide range of tourism products, such as hotel and car rental reservations. Single CRS \nsystems, such as SABRE, developed their database to include itineraries and inventory from other \nairlines, whilst two groups of scheduled airlines emerged in Europe to develop the Galileo and \nAmadeus GDSs [85,29]. GDSs still provide the backbone mechanism for communication between \nprincipals and travel agencies. They hold millions of fares in a database with up to 40 million \nchanges entered every month. Moreover, GDSs developed their capacity to handle more than \n500,000 passenger name records and nearly 2,000 messages per second [38].  \n \nSince the early 1990s, GDSs effectively became travel supermarkets, offering information and \nreservation capabilities for the entire range of travel products, including accommodation, car \nrentals, schedules for non-air transportation etc. GDSs enabled travel agencies to access all \nessential information on their screens and to develop comprehensive travel itineraries from the \nconvenience of one inter-connected system. GDSs are at the heart of scheduled airline operational \nand strategic agendas as they control and distribute the vast majority of the airline seats. Strategic \nalliances, consolidations, mergers and interrelations between CRSs resulted to four major GDSs, \nnamely SABRE, Worldspan, Amadeus, and Galileo [43].  These GDSs compete fiercely for \nrecruiting travel agencies and for penetrating the marketplace and aim to do that by developing a \nnumber of value-added services for travel agencies and airlines [71]. Table 1 demonstrates that \nGDSs emerged as highly successful businesses in their own right and often were far more \nprofitable than their airline parents themselves [32]. \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry 7\nTable 1: GDSs Operating Statistics\nCompan\ny\nPeriod\nEnding\nWorld\nwide\nlocatio\nns\nSegment\ns per\nyear\n(m)\nTotal\nRevenu\nes\n(m)\nOperating\nExpenses\n(m)\nOperating\nIncome\/\nLoss\n(m)\nOperating\nMargin\nOther\nIncome\n(m)\nLess\nTaxes\n(m)\nNet\nEarnings\n\/\nLoss\n(m)\nNet\nMargin\nSabre 2\/31\/99 N\/a 353 $2,434.6 $2,062.1 $372.5 15.3% $155.4 ($196.0) $331.9 13.6%\nGalileo\nInternati\nonal\n2\/31\/99 40,192 325 $1,526.1 $1,213.2 $312.9 20.5% $361.2 ($143.0) $218.2 14.3%\nAmadeus 2\/31\/99 48,126 269 $1,316.2 $1,093.4 $222.8 16.9% $25.2 ($77.5) $170.4 12.9%\nSource: [56] Global Aviation Associates, 2001\neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     8\n3. Airlines and the Internet revolution  \n \nThe emergence of the Internet in the mid 1990s as well as the development of Intranets and \nExtranets forced airlines to refocus their strategy on technological innovations in order to enhance \ntheir competitiveness. Airlines identified the Internet as a major opportunity to tackle distribution \ncosts and to reengineer the structure of the industry. In a recent interview, British Airways CEO, Rod \nEddington admitted that BA spent \u00a31.1 billion on distribution in 2001 and that was their third most \nsignificant expense after labour and fuel [56]. In the Internet era, GDSs as independent business \nfrom airlines developed their offerings to provide the backbone for the entire industry to establish \nthe infostructure for the transactions undertaken by a number of Internet travel portals. In \naddition, they gradually reinvented themselves to main technology suppliers for a wide range of \ntourism organisations including airlines, travel agencies and Internet travel portals. \n \nAt the same time, a number of no-frills airlines emerged in both Europe and the US. These airlines \nconcentrated on lower input cost in as many areas of their operations [4]. They also developed \nsimple distribution strategies and took full advantage of the Internet for communicating with their \nclientele [55]. Internet early adopters, including both well-established and newly-founded airlines \nidentified a clear opportunity. They invested heavily in order to develop their on-line brand name \nand to capture a significant market share. Pioneers included established airlines, such as American \nAirlines, and newcomers such as Bratthens, Rynair and Easyjet that adopted the Internet from the \nearly stages. Several carriers even painted their aircraft with their Internet address whilst they \narranged special promotions with newspapers to drive traffic to their web sites. They provided \nincentives for consumers to book online and ensured that they were not distributed through the \nGDSs, in a way forcing their clients online [13]. EasyJet and Ryannair, for example were taking the \nvast majority of their bookings through the Internet by 2002 and passed on their cost savings to \nconsumers by giving a \u00a35 discount on a return fare. No frills airlines, empowered by the Internet \nand other ICT tools, made the industry reengineer itself as it introduced a number of ICT-enabled \ninnovations including: \n \n\u2022 Electronic\/paperless tickets \n\u2022 Transparent and clear pricing led by proactive and reactive yield management \n\u2022 Single fare tickets with no restrictions on staying or Saturday nights rules \n\u2022 Commission capping and publication of net fares \n\u2022 Financial incentives for self-booking online  \n\u2022 Auctions and online promotions \n\u2022 Powerful Customer Relationship Management Systems \n\u2022 Online and context-relevant advertising \n \nAs consumers enjoyed interacting directly with airlines and benefited from lower rates, traffic for \ntraditional scheduled airlines and flag carriers declined. They therefore had to follow the lead of no-\nfrills carriers and to develop their online presence in order to maintain their competitiveness. In the \n2001 Airlines IT Trends survey it was revealed that airlines moved fast to Internet Protocol (IP) based \nsystems, having either to modernise legacy systems or to invest in new technological solutions. \nGetting closer to customer and cutting costs were the main key drivers for ICT projects and 20% \nof carriers have already moved to IP based systems and are enjoying the business and cost \nbenefits. Another third is expected to join them in the next two years and over 90% of the carriers \nare reported to have started the migration to IP. Just 6% of tickets are currently sold online, using \nweb based services and airlines gradually see their own web sites as the most important \ndistribution channel. It is estimated that by 2007, online sales and e-ticketing will become the \nmajor distribution mechanisms worldwide [58]. \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     9\n4. Methodology \n \nConsistent with the emerging nature of the ICTs and the constantly moving structures of the \nairline industry, this paper aims to answer the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d questions, rather than to \nquantify and verify particular variables. As there is insufficient literature on the topic and the use \nof ICTs in airlines is very dynamic, it was decided that exploratory research would better serve our \npurposes. The qualitative approach enables the appreciation of all aspects of the subject and to \ndevelop variables that can possibly be used later [67,21,35]. This effort therefore concentrated on \nthe reasons why technology was deployed and how it can assist the strategic and operational \nmanagement of airlines. The work was undertaken in early 2002 and allowed us to develop a \nholistic approach in assessing the strategic and tactical impacts of ICTs for airlines.  \n \nThe work was undertaken in three stages. Firstly, secondary research was used to revise the \ntheoretical framework and to identify previous research. As technology is moving fast here, only \narticles, reports, and books specialised in the ICTs in air transportation published in the last few \nyears were used. In addition, a number of articles and books that demonstrated the historic \ndevelopment of ICTs in travel and air-transportation provided the strategic management \nframework and identified critical applications. The second stage concentrated on an analysis of the \nweb presence for 40 major carriers, as demonstrated in Figure 1. Each web site was visited and \nexplored. The level of eCommerce opportunities as well as the comprehensiveness and user-\nfriendliness were examined. A number of value added services were identified and explored, whilst \na list of links and partners was collected for each airline. Extensive notes were taken in order to \nidentify the level of interactivity with consumers and other stakeholders. In addition, an analysis of \nICT providers for airlines was undertaken to explore the kind and type of services offered in the \nmarketplace. A list of the major suppliers researched is illustrated in Figure 2.   \n \nThe third part included semi-structured telephone interviews with airline executives. About 20 \nairline Chief Information Officers or Distribution Managers were contacted and eight agreed to \nparticipate. Although the number of airlines could have been improved, it was decided that an in-\ndepth analysis was better. The interviews aimed to explore what technology was used and for \nwhat purpose, on both strategic and tactical fronts. Interviewees were actively encouraged to \nspeculate on the future ICT solutions as well as to predict how ICTs might influence the structure \nof the industry as a whole. A standardised, but open-ended, approach to questioning was used; \nsome areas were explored in greater depth, through probing questions not originally included in \nthe interview schedule. Interviews were tape-recorded and tapes were listened to during the \nanalysis stage for further input. In addition, notes were kept on all questions asked. The semi-\nstructured discussion enabled the researcher to interact with participants and to identify and clarify \ncritical issues. Following the analysis of the unstructured interviews, a further round of qualitative \nwork was undertaken, mainly to qualify, support, and appreciate the findings. A number of \ninterviewees were asked to comment on some key finding and to provide their expert opinion. \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     10\nFigure 1: Airlines researched on-line \n \nAIRLINES \n1.

However, all carriers depend on ICTs for their \nstrategic and operational management and employ ICTs for a wide range of business departments. \nInterviewees suggested that they use software to support their business functions, including \naccounting, financial management, human resources, procurement etc. However, we concentrated \nonly on airline-specific software and systems that enable the operational and strategic management \nof airlines. An emphasis was given on distribution and marketing, as this has emerged as one of \ncritical aspects of airline strategy. \n \nFrom a strategic point of view, airlines use technology to develop and manage their business \nmodel as well as to monitor the external environment and competition, undertake revenue \nanalysis, forecasting, maintain historical data, predict demand, and design desirable products. ICTs \nare critical for monitoring and forecasting the performance of Strategic Business Units and for \ndeciding which markets airlines should penetrate and how. Routes and crew planning, frequency \nof service, choice of aircraft and developing relationships with strategic partners are key functions \nsupported by ICTs. Similarly strategic pricing and yield management are also supported by running \ncomplex algorithms to establish best performance and profitability levels.  \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     12\nICTs also allow airlines to reduce their dependence on intermediaries and that has direct strategic \nimplications for their partners and strategic alliances. Airlines executives admitted that this is more \nevident in no-frills carriers, which had no distribution or \u201ctechnology baggage to carry forward.\u201d \nThey claimed that it was easier for no-frills airlines to take advantage of the Internet, as they had \nno established distribution network and dedicated departments to look after travel agencies. At the \nsame time they had no legacy systems and dedicated links to GDSs and hence they were able to \nassess the situation more objectively. Many no-frills carriers decided that communicating directly \nwith consumers was much more cost-effective than going through intermediaries. They also \ndecided not to distribute their seats through GDSs. The cost of about $4 per segment for each \nbooking (regardless of whether that booking was honoured with a purchase), as well as the high \ndegree of cancellations experienced, were very expensive to bear, especially for low cost seats. \nNo-frills airlines therefore adopted the Internet as their main distribution mechanism and \ndisintermediated the distribution channel, placing scheduled airlines at a disadvantage. For \nexample Continental is reported to pay GDS booking fees of up to $17 per passenger and a total \ndistribution cost of $1bn per year [3]. Major scheduled carriers around the globe have therefore \ngenerally introduced commission capping and have invested heavily in driving Internet traffic to \ntheir web sites for online bookings. \n \nBranding and communication of principles are also critical for airlines at the strategic level. \nManaging communications with all stakeholders, including investors, press, employees and \ncustomers, is of paramount importance. ICTs-enabled communications assisted airlines to interact \nwith all their stakeholders and to update them with regards to their initiatives and developments. \nMany carriers used their web sites as main information points following the September 11 attacks, \nas well as other disturbances in their services emerging from their external environment, such as \nwars, earthquakes, SARS etc. Gareiss demonstrated how Continental managed the September 11th \ncrisis using cutting edge ICTs [30]. Interestingly, although the Internet provision was originally in \ntheir ICTs department, most airlines set up digital marketing and distribution departments to work \ntogether designing interfaces and devising successful strategies to attract and retain consumers. \nConsistency of on-line and off-line branding was one of the key issues highlighted as a factor for \nsuccess. Airline executives also mentioned that ICTs become a prerequisite for developing \npartnerships and alliances with other airlines, as well as for monitoring competitors. \n \nICTs are critical for the operational management of airlines, as illustrated in Figure 3. There are \nseveral requirements including check-in, allocation of seats, generating a number of reports and \norders, such as flight paths, weather forecasts, load and balance calculations, manifests for airport \nimmigration and security authorities, in-flight catering orders and crew rotas. ICTs also assist a \nnumber of functions including inventory and reservations management as well as ticketing. Airlines \nhave bases and distributors around the world, particularly at destinations they serve. Hence, they \nneed efficient co-ordination and communications with stations, branches, distributors, and \ncustomers globally. Interaction with distributors, travel agencies, and other distributors can \ndetermine levels of sales whilst efficient invoicing and revenue collection is critical for both cash \nflow and profitability. Finally, airlines have been investing in Customer Relationship Management \nprogrammes in order to improve their direct communication and to manage their loyalty clubs. \nIncreasingly, eTicketing instigates paperless transactions, while offering significant savings. \nTactical pricing, yield management, and special offers and promotions are all facilitated by \nconstantly assessing traffic and by taking both proactive and reactive measures to adjust demand \nand supply. ICTs also facilitate eProcurement and management of suppliers and partners on a \nregular basis. Most airlines use standardised software to undertake those functions and to \ngenerate the reports.  \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     13\nFigure 3: eAirlines ICT-empowered functions \nGeneric Airline Management \n \n\u2022 Strategic and Operational Management \n\u2022 Finance and accounting \n\u2022 Employee productivity and crew \nmanagement (rota, training etc) \n\u2022 Relationships with partners and alliance \nintegration  \n\u2022 Business management and reporting \n\u2022 Safety and security procedures \nStrategic Airline Functions \n \n\u2022 Strategic Business Unit Management \n\u2022 Routes Planning and market assessment \n\u2022 Monitoring of competitors \n\u2022 Strategic Pricing and yield management \n\u2022 Branding and communication of principles \n\u2022 Distribution strategy \n\u2022 Partnerships and alliances \n\u2022 Capacity and aircraft decisions \n \nInterface with consumers, partners \nagencies, other distributors and ticketing  \n \n\u2022 Inventory management and distribution of \ntickets  \n\u2022 Customer profiling, customer service and \ncommunication with consumers \n\u2022 Management of inventory and bookings \nthrough GDSs and the Internet  \n\u2022 Customer Relationships Management  \n\u2022 Managing loyalty clubs  \n\u2022 Reservations management, ticketing and \nelectronic ticketing \n\u2022 Operational management \n\u2022 Tactical pricing and yield management  \n\u2022 Promotions, special offers and targeted \ncampaigns  \n\u2022 eProcurement and management of \nsuppliers and partners  \n\u2022 Communications and transactions with \nstations, branches distributors and \ncustomers globally \n\u2022 Invoicing and revenue collection \n\u2022 Co-ordinating with partners and alliance \nmembers \n \nTactical planning and running the \nbusiness \n \n\u2022 Reservations and revenue support  \n\u2022 Check-in procedures and seats allocation  \n\u2022 Gate management and reporting to \nauthorities \n\u2022 Management of in-flight catering  \n\u2022 Airport passenger handling  \n\u2022 Cargo management,  \n\u2022 Baggage handling and monitoring \n\u2022 Pricing, ticketing, revenue and yield \nmanagement \n\u2022 Networking and schedule development \n\u2022 Scheduling, operational management and \ncontrol \n\u2022 Crew management and control \n\u2022 Maintenance management and control \n\u2022 Procurement of materials and equipment \n\u2022 Coordination of stations and hubs  \n\u2022 Weather, fuel and rota reports and \nmanifests  \n\u2022 Critical incidents management and \ncorrective mechanisms \n \nAirlines had to invest significantly in their ICT systems in the late 1990s in order to develop \ninterfaces with consumers and the travel trade. The level of investment in ICTs illustrates their \ncritical role. In the IT Trends Survey 2001 [59], the average planned ICT expenditure for 2001 was \n2.8% of the airline revenues. Figure 4 demonstrates that 24% of the respondents had planned to \nspend more than 4% of their revenue on ICT investments. The importance of ICTs is also evident \nby the fact that 29% of the carriers surveyed have started pilot studies using wireless and mobile \ntechnologies, whilst 60% now have ICTs represented at the board level.  \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     14\nFigure 4: Planned ICT investment as percentage of airline\u2019s revenue in 2001  \n \n2%\n5% 8%\n9%\n20% 22% 15%\n13%\n6%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\nMore than 10% 6-10% 5% 4% 3% 2% 1% Less than 1% Do not know\/no answer\n \nSource: O\u2019Toole, [60] \n \nInterviewees suggested that in the last few years, ICTs emerged from a pure infrastructure \ndepartment to a critical enabler of the entire range of the airline business processes. ICTs \neffectively determine the competitiveness of airlines, as they are embedded in every simple \nelement of the airline value chain, as illustrated in Figure 5.  \n \n5.1 Internal Systems and Intranets \n \nIn order to perform the tasks, airlines use a wide range of internal systems and intranets to \ncoordinate their activities. Interviewees were requested to explain the types of systems they use and \nthe main purpose that they fulfil. Internal airline systems were then classified into sales and \nmarketing support systems, operational, and resource management systems. A number of \ninformation management and decision support systems underpin the airline\u2019s core business \nprocesses and operational management. Interviewees suggested that airlines aim at maximising \ntheir profitability, by optimising their total yield and by minimising costs. This process is facilitated \nby a number of integrated systems that operate in parallel to coordinate a number of critical airline \nfunctions, such as accounting, financial management, human resources, etc. In addition, \nspecialised software facilitates scheduling in order to optimise crew, aircraft, and other resources \nand to maximise the operational efficiency whilst keeping costs under control. These systems are \nsimilar for all types of airlines and there were no major differences between scheduled, charter, \nand no-frills airlines. However, no-frills carriers and charter tended to schedule their flight \nprogrammes more tightly and therefore they tended to have a greater number of indicators and \ncontrols. \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry 15\nFigure 5 ICT enabled Airline Industry Value Chain\nI N B O U N D\nL O G I S T I C S\nO P E R A T I O N S O U T B O U N D\nL O G I S T I C S\nM A R K E T I N G\nA N D S A L E S\nS E R V I C E\nP R O C U R E M E N T\nT E C H N O L O G Y\nD E V E L O P M E N T\nH U M A N\nR E S O U R C E\nM A N A G E M E N T\nF I R M\nI N F R A S T R U C T U R E\nB u s i n e s s S t r a t e g y\nF i n a n c i a l M o d e l s\nS B U M a n a g e m e n t\nR e l a t i o n s h i p b u i l d i n g\nR e g u l a t o r y C o m p l i a n c e\nS t a k e h o l d e r s\nM a n a g e m e n t\nJ o b T r a i n i n g\nS a f e t y T r a i n i n g\nS a l e s f o r c e p l a n n i n g\nA g e n t T r a i n i n g\nI n c e n t i v e s\nC a r e e r p l a n n i n g\nS e r v i c e T r a i n i n g\nC R M a n d D a t a m i n i n g\nB a g g a g e T r a c k i n g S y s t e m\n\u2022 S e g m e n t a t i o n\n\u2022 D i s t r i b u t i o n\nm e c h a n i s m s\n\u2022 P r o m o t i o n\n\u2022 S p e c i a l o f f e r s &\nt a r g e t e d\nc a m p a i g n s\n\u2022 O n l i n e s a l e s\n\u2022 A d v e r t i s i n g\n\u2022 F r e q u e n t F l y e r\n\u2022 T r a v e l A g e n t\nP r o g r a m s\n\u2022 G r o u p S a l e s\n\u2022 I n v o i c i n g a n d\nr e v e n u e c o l l e c t i o n\n\u2022 R e s c h e d u l i n g\n\u2022 C o o r d i n a t i o n o f\ns t a t i o n s a n d h u b s\n\u2022 T i c k e t i n g a n d\nR e s e r v a t i o n s\n\u2022 C h e c k i n a n d G a t e\nO p e r a t i o n s\n\u2022 C a r g o\nm a n a g e m e n t\n\u2022 A i r c r a f t\nO p e r a t i o n s\n\u2022 O n - b o a r d S e r v i c e\n\u2022 B a g g a g e H a n d l i n g\n\u2022 T i c k e t O f f i c e s\n\u2022 M a r k e t a s s e s s m e n t\n\u2022 Y i e l d M a n a g e m e n t\na n d P r i c i n g\n\u2022 R o u t e s P l a n n i n g\n\u2022 F u e l m a n a g e m e n t\n\u2022 F l i g h t S c h e d u l i n g\n\u2022 C r e w S c h e d u l i n g\n\u2022 I n f l i g h t c a t e r i n g\n\u2022 A i r c r a f t S c h e d u l i n g\n\u2022 F a c i l i t i e s P l a n n i n g\n\u2022 P a s s e n g e r S e r v i c e\n\u2022 C o m p e t i t o r m o n i t o r i n g\nP r o d u c t\nD e v e l o p m e n t\nM a r k e t R e s e a r c h\n\u2022 C u s t o m e r R e l a t i o n s h i p\nM a n a g e m e n t\n\u2022 C u s t o m e r p r o f i l i n g ,\ns e r v i c e a n d\nc o m m u n i c a t i o n\n\u2022 C o m p l a i n t F o l l o w - u p\n\u2022 L o s t B a g g a g e S e r v i c e\n\u2022 C o o r d i n a t i n g w i t h\np a r t n e r s a n d a l l i a n c e\nm e m b e r s\n\u2022 R e n t a l C a r a n d\n\u2022 H o t e l r e s e r v a t i o n\nS y s t e m\n\u2022 C o m m u n i c a t i o n\nw i t h a i r p o r t\na u t h o r i t i e s\n\u2022 B a g g a g e S y s t e m s\n\u2022 F l i g h t c o n n e c t i o n\n\u2022 C o m m i s s i o n\np a y m e n t s\n\u2022 C r i t i c a l i n c i d e n t s\nm a n a g e m e n t\n\u2022 B u s i n e s s\nm a n a g e m e n t a n d\nr e p o r t i n g\n\u2022 S a f e t y a n d s e c u r i t y\np r o c e d u r e s\nP r o c u r e m e n t , I n - f l i g h t S y s t e m , C o m p u t e r R e s e r v a t i o n S y s t e m\nF l i g h t S c h e d u l i n g S y s t e m Y i e l d M a n a g e m e n t S y s t e m\nC o o p e r a t i o n T r a i n i n g\nP r o c e d u r e a n d\nO p e r a t i o n a l T r a i n i n g\nR e l a t i o n s h i p s w i t h\nt r a i n e r s a n d c o l l e g e s\nP R I\nM A\nR Y\nA C\nT I V\nI T I\nE S\nS U P P O R T\nA C T I V I T I E S\nP a r t n e r s h i p a n d\nC o m p e t i t i o n\nM a n a g e m e n t\nP o l i c i e s\nO p e r a t i o n a l\nP r o c e d u r e s\ne P r o c u r e m e n t\nO r d e r i n g & R e c e i v i n g\nS p e c i f i c a t i o n s\nD e l i v e r y i n s t r u c t i o n s\nI n c o r p o r a t i n g i n\no p e r a t i o n s\nB r a n d i n g\nO n l i n e s e r v i c e s\nM o n i t o r i n g S u p p l i e r s\nE s t a b l i s h i n g p a r t n e r s h i p s\neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     16\n5.1.1 Sales and marketing support \n \nAirlines have long used internal Computer Reservation Systems. They are often interfaced with GDSs \nand with the airline Internet site in order to distribute inventory globally and to ensure that it is \ncurrent. These systems are used to issue electronic tickets and to exchange e-tickets with multiple \ncarriers worldwide. Interviewees suggested that they desperately need to promote their web site as \ntheir primary reservation path and as an alternative to the GDS\/travel agency route. Such systems \nlink all partners in the handling process, automate procedures, and support smooth communication \nflow. Airlines endeavour to use technology to enhance their efficiency and therefore they attempt \nto integrate new technologies such as electronic scales, stacker systems, handheld terminals, and \nbar coding to increase their handling efficiency and to reduce operational costs. Therefore, these \nsystems support the administration, accounting, and passenger or cargo handling processes by \ncoordinating inventory management, sales and marketing, yield and revenue management, \nticketing, and departure control systems.  \n \nAirlines use decision support systems to monitor traffic and bookings on computer reservation \nsystems in order to identify customer behaviour, traffic flows or trends, as well as the performance \nof partners and sales agencies. They also follow the pricing of their competitors for numerous city \npairs. These systems also enable airlines to assess their situation against the performance of their \ncompetitors and to adopt proactive and reactive measures. A broad information base leads to \nmore suitable decisions for core airline strategy and operational activities, such as marketing and \nsales, schedule planning, yield management, or pricing.  \n \n5.1.2 Operational Systems  \n \nAirlines need to use effective planning processes to optimise the performance of their network. \nThis involves maximisation of the equipment and human resources utilisation against demand \npressures, government regulations, and operational constraints, such as air traffic control rules. \nInterviewees suggested that planning decisions range from long-term strategic issues, such as \nroutes selection and competition monitoring, to operational considerations, such as schedules for \nequipment and staff rotas. Scheduling implies deciding the number of connections between \nairports as well as timing and choice of aircraft equipment. Planning and operations departments \nuse Integrated Flight Schedule Management Systems to support airlines in planning their \nschedules. Such systems need to provide seamless integration with other systems, including \nOperations Control, Reservations and Revenue Management, Maintenance Control, and Crew \nManagement.  They examine historic traffic data and previous load factors as well as forecast \ndemand figures. The proliferation of hub and spoke systems has forced planning departments to \nmanage their network as a whole by scheduling departure waves and coordinating flights. Aiming \nto maximise load factors and yield management for the entire network, airlines use Flight Schedule \nManagement Systems to predict traffic and to simulate operational discrepancies caused by delays, \nweather conditions, and other unpredictable circumstances that disrupt schedules.  \n \nComplementary to Schedule management systems are Operations Control systems that support the \nautomatic calculation and distribution of flight plans, as well as other features, such as automatic \nconsideration of all valid aeronautical restrictions in the process of the flight plan calculation. Flight \nWatch in particular collects and displays vital information, such as booking figures, passenger \ntransfer information, critical weather conditions, crew rotations, airport limitations, etc. Possible \nproblems and critical situations can be identified whilst early alert messages and updates are \ngenerated for all other operational systems, such as flight scheduling, reservation, maintenance, \nand crew control systems.  \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     17\nIn addition, as airlines usually have a wide network of hubs to support, Station Control Systems \nmonitor all kinds of connections on a hub and report on operational details, such as aircraft turns, \ncrew connections, passenger, baggage, and cargo connections. Airports and airlines need to work \ntogether to reduce aircraft turn-around times and to shorten passenger connection times. These \nsystems also help station managers plan their operations and ensure that all resources are in place \nto service each flight. Baggage handling and monitoring systems allow airlines to increase their \nefficiency and to track every bag as it moves through the system. This also ensures that no baggage \nis transported without its owner, as per International Civil Aviation Organisation regulations. The \nsystems support reconciliation procedures of checked passenger baggage enable airlines to ensure \nsecurity, reduce operating costs, and improve passenger satisfaction without compromising \npunctuality [20].  \n \n5.1.3 Resource Management Systems  \n \nAirlines need to maximise the utilisation of their most expensive resources: human resources and \nfleet. Therefore, they need to ensure that their equipment and aircraft is functional and its \ncapacity fully used. Maintenance Control systems co-ordinate aircraft maintenance, commercial, \nand operational requirements. They ensure that aircraft and other equipment is regularly \nmaintained and also that technical problems and unscheduled services are dealt with as efficiently \nas possible to minimise out-of-service periods whilst minimising service disruptions. Often these \nsystems are integrated with eProcurement systems for allowing airlines to order parts and other \nconsumables online, whilst engineering systems may be integrated for providing online manuals \nand technical support. Technical documentation management systems often create, distribute, and \nmanage complex technical data and documents. Hence, airlines aim to maximise fleet utilisation by \nimproving maintenance, repair and overhaul performance. This is achieved by optimising the supply \nchain network, aircraft downtime, and materials management.  \n \nAirlines also control their crew rotas through crew management systems. Planning duty rosters is a \ncomplex process as there are numerous key constraints, including skills and the ability to operate \nequipment, rank, immigration issues, rest periods, and cost of rest periods. Crew management \nsystems use comprehensive crew databases to undertake pairing construction, roster generation, \nand crew control in order to optimise the human resources performance. They need to be co-\nordinated with all associated activities, such as flight scheduling, operations control, crew contact, \nflight briefing, etc. These systems can also undertake a number of routine tasks, such as checking \nlegalities, publishing rosters and notifications, and administrating hotel accommodation, dead-\nheads and pick-up services. Communicating scheduling information with crews (notifications) and \nnext duty period (briefings) as well as information regarding flight load, crew composition, aircraft \nand airport details is also critical. A number of intranet solutions facilitate this process [45]. It is \nthe coordination of all these systems that ensures that airlines enjoy operational efficiency and are \nempowered to achieve their long-term strategy.  \n \n5.2 Interconnecting partner systems and Extranets \n \nInterviewees also explained that airlines rely heavily on external partners for their operations. \nTherefore it is critical to develop efficient systems for working together with them. For example, all \nairlines need airport infrastructure as well as a variety of partners to support their operations.  \n \n5.2.1 eProcurement: transactions and information flows with suppliers \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     18\nSuitable extranets and inter-organisational systems are required to facilitate airline interaction with \ntheir regular suppliers. Airlines are customers of airports, air control systems, and other authorities \nsuch as immigration and customs. Airlines, therefore, regularly exchange information with airport \nauthorities and air traffic control systems. These flows include requests for landing slots and docking \ngates, informing about arrivals and departures, altering slots, declaring flight paths, and coordinating \noperations. Although many airlines and airports still rely on printed forms and telephone \ncommunications, a good percentage of the interviewees suggested that ICT-enabled systems are \ncurrently constructed to support these processes. A number of airlines gradually developed or \nadopted electronic environments for data exchange with the Customs and Airport Authorities in \ntheir main stations. Extranets assisted them to develop reliable and direct connections and \nenhance their efficiency. Interviewees expected that the global security concerns will generate \nfurther regulation that will make interactive extranets a prerequisite for flying to several \ntechnologically advanced destinations, particularly the USA. \n \nAirlines also interact with a number of organisations that provide handling services at airports, \nincluding maintenance, refuelling, security, baggage handling, load and dispatch, lounge provision, \ncatering, and cleaner services. In most cases, these services are provided by a number of companies. \nThe range of products and services purchased varies. One of the interviewees demonstrated the \nlevel of information required to fulfil the value chain by quoting that Air India is serving 24 \ndifferent meals on board. Customer orders need to be communicated to caterers well in advance \nand need to be prepared, stored, and served in a particular way. In addition, handling a large \namount of baggage on a daily basis between a number of airlines and airports is very complex and is \nfacilitated by Extranets. \n \neProcurement is also a major force for Extranets. As airlines regularly purchase products and services, \nsuch as fuel, aircraft parts, and catering, B2B applications allow them to benefit from cost savings and \nefficiency. Several major airlines with large networks emerge as suppliers for other carriers as well. \nLufthansa, for example, has three types of procurement tools in operation or in planning. The \nAirPlus \"ProNet\" product, offers an online catalogue system for ordering general supplies like \ncomputer hardware, forms, and office furniture. The Fair Partners web site puts all types of orders \nout to tender. Finally the \"AeroXchange\" marketplace is being set up by Lufthansa, in cooperation \nwith most of the Star Alliance partners, as an airline industry online trading exchange that offers \nindustry-specific goods and services ranging from special screws to aero-engines. Procurement \nmarketplaces have become highly economical for airlines by making markets more transparent and \nby allowing companies to bundle their procurement volumes. \n \nDeveloping B2B applications and interconnecting Extranet systems will support both airlines and their \npartners to streamline them and reduce their turn-around time at the airport. Clarity of \ncommunication and efficiency chain is critical for both controlling costs and delivering service. \n \n5.2.2 Distribution, marketing and sales support with partners \n \nThe vast majority of airlines rely heavily on travel agencies for distributing their products. \nInterviewees suggested that the link with travel agencies is normally facilitated by Global Distribution \nSystems that provide the infostructure for itinerary building and facilitate the entire transaction. \nHowever, airline executives explained that they would like to transact with travel agencies on an \nExtranet, over the Internet, in order to avoid that GDS\u2019s booking fees for lower fares. For example, \nBritish Airways has developed a dedicated web site for the travel trade \n(http:\/\/www.batraveltrade.com\/) that can be developed to an extranet in order to facilitate this \nprocess. However, travel agencies may gradually find some useful financial features. For example \nthey will be able to process credit card payments in a way that charges the airline the cost of the \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     19\ncredit card fee (currently about 2%). Similarly KLM provides its web fares only on its extranet, whilst \nGDS fares are more expensive to cover the extra costs. Although connecting is technically possible, \ninterviewees suggested that travel agencies are reluctant to follow this route, partly because they \nprefer comparing all schedules and prices on a GDS and partly because GDSs provide incentives and \nthey have long term contractual agreements with them. Interviewees suggested that there is a great \npotential in these types of extranets and that the business logic will be driving technological \ndeployment.  \n \nAirlines also appoint General Sales Agencies in all regions that do not operate their own offices. They \nare appointed by international airlines to secure business from IATA and non-IATA agents in \nmarkets where agency networks are yet to be fully automated and where airlines need financial \nsecurity to cover business risks. They handle their reservations and distribution locally and are in \nclose link with the Station manager to co-ordinate the activity in their particular market. In addition, \nconsolidators pre-purchase seats in bulk and then distribute them to their local markets at discounted \nrates. Developing Extranets for these players and ensuring that they support their onward distribution \nchain, providing adequate tools to interact with all departments of the airline and managing their \nrevenue collection on time are also critical for airline profitability.  \n \n5.2.3 Horizontal collaboration with other airlines \n \nThe vast majority of airline investment is concentrated on distribution, as it is becoming one of the \nmost important elements of airline marketing strategy and competitiveness. Distribution strategies \ndetermine all other elements of the marketing mix. Air fares are modified by commission costs and \nreservation fees. The product itself is determined, since CRSs facilitate the development of hub \nand spoke systems as well as code-share agreements. Promotion is also influenced, as online and \noff-line promotional campaigns primarily aim to increase traffic to airline web sites.  \n \nICTs will not only formulate all elements of the marketing mix of airlines in the future, but they will \nalso determine their strategic directions, partnerships, and ownership. The global alliances, such as \nthe \u201cStar Alliances\u201d, are only possible because of the co-ordination that can be achieved through \nharmonised ICT systems or through effective interfaces. In effect consumers receive a seamless \nservice, collect frequent flyer miles and enjoy privileges from different carriers in all continents \nsimply because ICTs provide the \u201cinfo-structure\u201d for close collaboration. Hence, the ICTs are also \ninstrumental for the globalisation of the airline industry. \n \nCooperation between two or more airlines may include code-sharing agreements, alliances, and \nother business arrangements [34,26,74]. Alliances can propel a number of benefits for both \nairlines and passengers. Naturally the level of their success depends on each individual alliance \nand also on the ability of the carriers to collaborate with partners in order to maximise benefits. \nSome of the most critical benefits are illustrated in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 Benefits of Airline alliances \nCONSUMER BENEFITS AIRLINE BENEFITS \n\u2022 Fairly consistent service across several \nairlines and regions \n\u2022 Virtual expansion of network \n\u2022 Access to airport lounges  \u2022 Access to new markets by tapping into \npartner\u2019s under-utilised route rights or slots \n\u2022 Frequent flyers miles on member \nairlines  \n\u2022 Code Sharing and GDS ranking \n\u2022 World-wide recognition of status and \nloyalty club benefits \n\u2022 Traffic volumes and ability to feed long \nhaul flights  \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     20\n\u2022 Priority reservation, standby and \nboarding  \n\u2022 Protect home markets and building \npresence in distance markets \n\u2022 Priority baggage handling  \u2022 Common marketing and branding \n\u2022 Technological solutions for travellers \u2022 Economies of Scale through resource \npooling across operational areas \n\u2022 Flexible round the world fares  \u2022 Increased load factor and yield \nSources: Based on [33,1,57,7]. \n \nInterviewees suggested that if alliances are to exploit their full benefits a certain degree of \nsystems and software interoperability should be established. Being able to communicate records \nelectronically between different airlines is key for them to collaborate efficiently. Extranets can \nallow the on-line exchange of schedule information, reservations, information on frequent flyers, \nand market trends. They can also help to settle accounts electronically. In addition, they can credit \neach other\u2019s loyalty schemes and allow passengers to change their seating or meal requirements \nonline. There are currently few alliances and airlines that use Extranets to co-ordinate their \ncollaboration with other partners though. Interviewees suggested that the low deployment of \nextranets may explain the low level of integration between carriers and the limited success of \nalliances.  \n \n5.3 Connecting with consumers and all stakeholders through the Internet \n \nThe proliferation of the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s changed the airline business \ndramatically and enabled new business models to emerge. By 1998, most airlines already hosted \nWeb sites to inform consumers and to support itinerary building, fare construction, and \nreservations. They enhanced their interactivity with consumers and built relationship-marketing \nstrategies as well as frequent flyer systems [47,54,31,42,70]. Web sites also assisted airlines to \nlaunch another communication and purchasing channel in order to reduce the power and costs of \nconventional intermediaries such as travel agencies and GDSs.  \n \nAir transportation accounts for approximately 65% of all travel eCommerce. It is estimated that \nInternet bookings contribute about 5% of the total airline sales globally [50]. However there are \ngreat variations between regions and carriers. The figures quoted for American carriers are \nsignificantly greater, as a result of a greater penetration of the Internet. In the USA 11% of the \nairlines seats are booked online on carriers\u2019 web sites. No-frills carriers in the USA are clear front \nrunners, with 41% of their seats booked online [51].  \n \nNo-frills airlines are using their web sites to attract and communicate directly with consumers [41]. \nThis enables them to bypass travel agencies and their commissions. In 2003, both Easyjet and \nRyanair achieved more than 92% of their bookings through their web sites, whilst Southwest sold \n50% of its tickets on its web site. Interviewees suggested that there are a number of reasons, as \ndemonstrated in Table 3. \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     21\nTable 3 Reasons for no-frills airlines\u2019 success in Internet bookings \nSimpler Product \u2022 Often A-B-A itineraries and tickets  \n\u2022 One class of service \n\u2022 Each segment priced individually \n\u2022 No catering on board \n\u2022 No pre-allocation of seats  \nSimple Distribution \nChannel  \n\u2022 Single distribution channel through own calling centres and internet \n\u2022 Financial incentives to book online and disincentives for phone bookings \n\u2022 Net rates across all channels \n\u2022 No commitment to existing distribution channel members \n\u2022 Partnership with popular off-line media, such as newspapers \nAdvanced CRM and \naggressive direct \nmarketing \n\u2022 Email and SMS driven Customer Relationship Management \n\u2022 Aggressive banner advertising policies \n\u2022 Context-based advertising \n\u2022 Data and email acquisition through online and off-line campaigns  \nAggressive pricing \nand yield \nmanagement  \n\u2022 Individual priced seats  \n\u2022 Minimal fare restrictions \n\u2022 Proactive and reactive pricing \n\u2022 Provocative pricing starting from offering free flights  \nAdvanced \nInformation \nTechnologies \n\u2022 No legacy systems \n\u2022 No commitment to Global Distribution Systems  \n\u2022 Paperless office and efficient procedures \n\u2022 Interconnectivity with technologically advanced partners \nDynamic \npackaging and \nvalue added \nservices \n\u2022 Proactive approach in selling complementary services, such as hotels and \ncar rentals through white labelling \n\u2022 Additional value added services such as flight watch, destination guides \netc \nMost interviewees admitted that no-frills carriers have pioneered Internet provision. However, a \nnumber of innovative scheduled airlines have realised that the Internet should be their main \ndistribution channel and are fighting back. Not only have they adjusted their prices and their \npricing policies but they also use the Internet to demonstrate the extra value they offer for \ncomparable prices. At the end of 2002 a number of innovative scheduled carriers achieved more \nthan 30% of the bookings on their web site and aimed to achieve 50-70% by 2005 -- primarily \nachieved by offering their best fares only on their web sites. For example, British Airways\u2019 Internet \nsite currently achieves 1.5m visits per month, whilst the average growth of on-line bookings has \nbeen 11% per month. BA aims to achieve 80% of customer trip transactions as well as 100% of \nthe executive club transactions on their Internet site by 2004. They hope that 100% of their \ntickets will be electronic and that 50% of their passengers will be self-checking in. These initiatives \nare expected to save \u00a3100 million British pounds. By providing a colour-coded pricing interface, \nBritish Airways allows passengers to chose from a wide range of prices, determined by demand \nlevels. The airline has also integrated its provision with its frequent flyer club as well as with its \ncheck-in facilities, allowing a seamless process. Several interviewees explained that gradually \nscheduled airlines will fight back and will increase their Internet bookings in the very near future. \n \nSeveral structural changes in the industry have emerged as a result of the ability of airlines to \ncommunicate directly with consumers. The most useful feature is the ability to promote distressed \ncapacity at discounted rates at the last minute. Following the September 11th events and also the \nconsequent global unrest most airlines were able to promote heavily discounted fares via \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     22\nelectronic mail and auctions. As a result, they managed to sell a significant proportion of their \nperishable seats, contributing directly to the bottom line. Industry experts explained that this \nshould be regarded as direct profit, as airlines would have otherwise lost this revenue.  \n \nThe ability to disintermediate travel agencies has also enabled airlines to cut down commission \nrates. Airlines initially in the USA, and increasingly globally, reduced their commission rates (from \n10-12% to 7%-0%), whilst they also introduced \u201ccommission capping\u201d (e.g. $50 per ticket). Major \nairlines quote savings of several million dollars. In addition, electronic ticketing and ticketless travel \nhave gradually reduced distribution, fulfilment, and labour costs whilst increasing efficiency. \nContinental Airlines is often quoted as an example of an airline which decreased its cost by 20 \nmillion dollars simply by reducing commissions to travel agencies and by introducing electronic \nticketing.  \n \nFinally interviewees explained that most airlines use their web or other specific sites to manage \ntheir relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. Shareholders and investors are informed \nonline about the share value and other operational statistics. Environmental groups and local \nplanners are provided with information on policies and initiatives. Airlines often provide kids \nactivities and games to encourage younger passengers to engage with the airline, whilst a number \nof value added services, such as screen savers, are often available on line. Journalists are provided \nwith newsletters and photographs whilst plane spotters and aviation enthusiasts are also catered \nfor by a number of carriers. Interviewees suggested that developing and maintaining high \nvisitation to their web sites is part of their strategic objectives. \n \n6. ICT-empowered Strategic alliances \n \nInterviewees suggested that ICTs and the Internet have gradually enabled new types of strategic \nalliances and have forced airlines to collaborate and compete (coopete) simultaneously. Alliances \nsupport the integration of their frequent flyer programs and benefits. They also provide access to \nbusiness lounges and allow endorsement waivers to enable passengers to switch between airlines. \nAlliances support code sharing, optimisation of capacity and yield, as well as a certain level of \ncollaboration. Co-opetion is also extended to sharing systems and ICT expertise. Almost half of the \nairlines within alliances are already sharing systems with their partners and another 20% plan to \ndo so to help offering customer seamless services. Outsourcing has increased across all airlines \nand 85% of carriers have already outsourced all or part of their ICT functions. \n \nCoopetition was the main driver of the development of Orbitz and Opodo as independent Internet \ntravel agencies by airlines on both sides of the Atlantic in order to reduce the power of electronic \ntravel agencies, such as Expedia and Travelocity, and to develop alternative distribution channels. \nTable 4 demonstrates the ownership of the two systems. Orbitz was designed to gives access to \ntravellers to reservations across several airlines as well as to car rental, hotels, vacation packages, \nand other travel products. Similarly, in Europe, nine airlines launched Opodo in Germany, the UK, \nand France in 2002. Further expansion into other European countries is planned for 2004 and \nbeyond. These systems offer unbiased and competitively priced online travel service for world \ntravel, with access to flights from over 400 airlines, 30,000 hotel properties, and over 11,000 car \nhire locations worldwide, as well as travel insurance. \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     23\nTable4 Opodo and Orbitz ownership  \nCompany Owners \nOpodo Aer Lingus, Air France, Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Finnair, Iberia, \nKLM, Lufthansa, and Amadeus (GDS) \nOrbitz American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and United \nAirlines increasingly develop links through alliances, industry bodies such as IATA and SITA, and \ncommon ventures to develop common platforms for eCommerce, eProcurement, and for \nfacilitating their business and operational functions. These are faced with both technological and \nbusiness challenges. As with many other organisations, most airlines are used to competing. \nGradually they learn how to compete and collaborate with other carriers. In reality, the existing \nstrategic alliances, such as OneWorld and the Star Alliance, have failed to develop services and \ncollaboration beyond code-sharing and loyalty club collaboration.  \n \nAirlines need to develop stronger alliances and meaningful networks of wealth creation if they are to \nsurvive global competition in future. Business strategies and alliances management will therefore \nneed to refocus and include ICT solutions as part of their core competence, their collaboration \ninfostructure, and brand drivers. Only then will alliances be able to maximise their contribution and \ntheir impact in the marketplace. Business interconnectivity requires technical interoperability and \nairlines need to agree on technological standards and common approaches. So far, airlines are \ngiving a confusing message. Carriers that have originally supported either Galileo or Amadeus now \nsupport Opodo whilst some form the Star Alliance and some, from OneWorld, support this venture. \nUnless airlines coordinate their infostructure and develop competitive online systems they will be \nunable to capitalise on the increasing potential of ICTs. Hitherto, they have been prevented from \ndoing so by the dominance of legacy systems that operate on proprietary protocols and platforms. \nThis prevents airlines from communicating and also makes it difficult to develop Extranet \napplications and protocols for electronic exchanges with trusted partners, such as airports, \ndistributors, and catering and handling companies. Interviewees suggested that a certain degree \nof technological standardisation will therefore be required in order to support airlines in expanding \ntheir electronic exchanges and to maximise the operational efficiency of the entire system across \nall members of the alliance.  \n \n7 ICT-enabled airlines of the future \n \nAirlines are one of the most interdependent organisations in the travel industry. Therefore they \nneed to use technology strategically to integrate their operations and control and co-ordinate all \ntheir business and management functions. Figure 6 demonstrates that networked airlines of the \nfuture will take advantage of the Internet as well as Intranets and Extranets to communicate with \nall their stakeholders, to improve their internal efficiency and effectiveness and interact with all \ntheir stakeholders productively. Implementing enterprise resource planning can help airlines \nintegrate all facets of their business and maximise their performance.  Developing successful \nExtranets will also allow airlines to develop effective collaboration channels with all their partners.  \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     24\nFigure 6: The networked airline of the future \nNETWORKED\nAIRLINE\n& IT\nSTRATEGY\nIntranet\nIntra-\norganis\national\nExtranet\nInter-organisational\nInternet\nConsumers and\nSociety\nINTERNAL AIRLINE SYSTEMS\nSales and marketing support\n\u2022Computer Reservation Systems\n\u2022Global Distribution Systems\n\u2022Reservations and Revenue\nManagement\n\u2022Decision support systems\nOperational Systems\n\u2022Flight Schedule Management\nSystems\n\u2022Operations Control,\n\u2022Flight Watch\n\u2022Station Control Systems\n\u2022Baggage handling and\nmonitoring systems\nResource Management Systems\n\u2022Maintenance Control\n\u2022Crew management systems\nINTERCONNECTING PARTNER\nSYSTEMS AND EXTRANETS\neProcurement: transactions and\ninformation flows with suppliers\n\u2022Extranets\n\u2022Reports for Air Traffic Control,\nCustoms and Airport Authorities\n\u2022Reports for suppliers\n\u2022eProcurement tools and software\n\u2022Marketplace\n\u2022Baggage Systems and WorldTracer\nDistribution, marketing and sales\nsupport with partners\n\u2022Computer Reservation Systems\n\u2022Global Distribution Systems\n\u2022Dedicated travel trade portals &\nsystems\n\u2022General Sales Agencies systems &\nExtranets\nHorizontal collaboration with other\nairlines\n\u2022Extranets between alliance members\nCONNECTING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH THE INTERNET\nConsumers Stakeholders\n\u2022Information, itineraries, Reservations \u2022 Shareholders\n\u2022Special offers, auctions \u2022 Environmental Groups\n\u2022Frequent Flyer clubs and redemptions \u2022 Journalists and newsletters\n\u2022Personal preferences \u2022 Place spotters and aviation enthusiasts\n\u2022 Check in facilities \u2022 Value added\n\u2022Operational updates \n\u2022Baggage Systems and WorldTracer\n \nManaging the entire supply chain electronically can allow all partners to benefit by reducing costs, \nincreasing their transaction accuracy, and optimising their efficiency. There is evidence that \neProcurement is developing rapidly and it seems that other Extranet applications will be emerging \nsoon to facilitate communications and interaction with Customs, Immigration, Airport, Air Traffic \nControl, and Civil Aviation Authorities. An integration between wireless LAN solutions will allow \nconnections with wired LANs and will support a wide range of airline, airport, and consumer \napplications [68]. Outsourcing will also be a trend. Several components of airline operational \nsystems are already operated by trusted partners and a number of specialised Application Service \nProviders (ASPs). Outsourcing will allow carriers to concentrate on running their business \nsuccessfully and leave technology to specialised experts.  \n \nO\u2019Toole identifies a number of challenges that are critical for airlines to maximise their ICT potential \nand achieve strategic and operational management objectives. These include: lack of skilled ICT \npersonnel; lack of investment; lack of ICT personnel with airline experience; resources concentrated \non legacy systems; lack of board level supervision; poor outsourcing experiences; and technology \nnot ready yet to support the range of airline requirements. A number of business critical issues: \nsecurity, customer relationship management, lack of industry standards, revenue management and \nprotection of the brand integrity, dynamic packaging, and itinerary changes and cancellations. In \naddition, airlines face additional challenges following the 11th September events [37]. Safety and \nsecurity have emerged as the single most critical challenge and emerging legislation will force \nairlines to provide better access to information for Immigration and Custom authorities. Detection \nsecurity systems are expected to help airlines prevent hazardous material being taken on board and \nto identify defects at an early stage. In addition, tracing material, luggage, and passengers through \nICT will increase efficiency and reduce theft and accidents. However, all these systems will require \nfurther investment.  \n \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     25\nTechnologies can improve the entire customer travelling experience. Frequent travellers demand \nspeedier check-in processes and a higher degree of flexibility and control over their own travel \narrangements. eTicketing and paperless communications are expected to improve customer \nservice by reducing the level of bureaucracy, by increasing flexibility, and by speeding up all \nprocesses. Self-service kiosk applications will increasingly support travellers make travel \nreservations, check-in, receive boarding passes, select seats, check frequent flier miles, request \nupgrades, purchase a ticket, print e-ticket receipts, or check bags - all without waiting in-line for \nan agent. Providing self-services through kiosks and wireless technologies can provide benefits \nincluding: operational and productivity gains; reduction of check-in times; support of flights to \ndepart and arrive on-time; minimisation of check-in unit costs; improved customer satisfaction; \nand reduced costs. In-flight entertainment, communications and constant interaction will also be \ncritical in future. ICTs will therefore be used dynamically before, during and after the travel \nexperience to serve passengers and to reinforce the airline brand.  \n \nThe ability of travellers to connect from virtually anywhere with their wireless devices and adapt \ntheir itinerary is expected to be one of the most widely used services [10]. Wireless solutions will \nempower airlines to communicate with their passengers virtually anywhere, anytime. Wireless and \nmobile devices, such as Mobile phones, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), and laptops, are already \nused for searching and booking flights, altering flight arrangements, retrieving updated arrival and \ndeparture information, checking-in, and selecting seats. The Star Alliance allows members to \ndownload timetables and booking agents to their PDAs. Gradually, airlines will have to integrate \ntheir Internet presence with mobile portals whilst they will communicate flight alerts through a \nshort message service or mobile email. Wireless networks are currently being implemented in \nseveral airports and airlines will need to work with ground operators to integrate their service. \n \n8 Conclusions \n \nICTs play a critical role in the strategic and operational management of airlines. They not only \ncontribute to the formulation of all elements of the marketing mix, but they will also determine the \nstrategic directions, partnerships, and ownership of airlines. It can therefore be predicted that \ntechnology will facilitate and support the successful airlines of the future. As ICTs are instrumental \nin re-arranging airline alliances and concentration, it is also likely that technology may provide a \nmajor motivation for merger and collaborations. \n \nICTs are already instrumental for the globalisation and concentration of the airline industry. \nFurther integration and consolidation seems inevitable. ICTs will enable airlines to establish global \nnetworks, to serve their customers better and to communicate with their partners more efficiently \non a global basis. They will need to provide the \u201cinfo-structure\u201d for closer collaboration with all \nstakeholders available. Hence, the networked airline of the future will take advantage of the \nInternet, Intranets, and Extranets to strengthen its position, reinforce its brand and contribute to \nits profitability.  \neAirlines: Strategic and tactical use of ICTs in the airline industry                     26\nBIBLIOGRAPHY  \n \n[1] B.
