A significant \nproportion of that cell death will involve astrocytes, a fact that has been \nobfuscated by the wide application of cell culture techniques to the examination \nof the relative sensitivity of brain cell types to ischemia. Such in vitro studies have \nrepeatedly shown that cultured astrocytes are much more resistant to modeled \nischemia than are cultur d neurons (e.g. Goldberg and Choi, 1993). However, it \nis well established that even short periods of global brain ischemia that are just \nsufficient to kill the brains most ischemia-sensitive neurons also produce a \ndegree of astrocyte death (Petito, 1986; Petito et al., 1998), while several studies \nusing short periods of modeled ischemia can produce regions of astrocyte injury \nwith little collateral neuronal damage (Garcia et al., 1993; Schmidt-Kastner et al., \n1993). Consistent with this, a careful examination of the literature shows that \nmost astrocytes in vivo are only marginally less sensitive to acute ischemic injury \nthan are neurons when injury is assessed using reliable ultrastructural or \nimmuno-staining techniques (see Table 1, and Fern, 2001 for a review). For \nexample, lesions that follow relatively brief focal ischemia involve a significant \ndegree of astrocyte death (Garcia et al., 1993; Schmidt-Kastner et al., 1993; \nDavies et al., 1998), while brief periods of global ischemia produce a reduction in \nthe astrocyte marker GFAP assessed 2 days post-injury (Petito and Halaby, \n1993), correlating with the presence of dead astrocytes at the injury site (Petito et \nPage 3 of 25 Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n4\nal., 1998). It is consistent with this that approximately half of white matter \nastrocytes maintained within the isolated neonatal optic nerve die after a 45-80 \nmin period of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) (Fern, 1998; Thomas et al., \n2004), which is not dissimilar to the time required to kill cultured neurons (see \nFern 2001 for a review).\nTable 1 near here\nReactive astrocytosis may obscure acute astrocyte injury\nThere is evidence that a population of astrocytes may remain viable within \nthe core of an ischemic event (Thoren et al., 2005), and in transgenic animals \nwhere the fluorescent protein GFP is under the control of the astrocyte specific \npromoter GFAP we often observed a small population of astrocytes that survive \n40-60 min of OGD (e.g., see Fig 1 and 2). Such cells, together with cells in the \npenumbra region surrounding the lesion core, may provide the substrate for the \nreactive astrocytosis that is a cardinal feature of the post-ischemic brain. This \nphenomenon is characterized by an increase in astrocyte number, somata \nvolume and GFAP content (Ridet et al., 1997). There are reliable ultrastructural \nreports that early reactive changes are apparent in astrocytes within 15 min of \nthe onset of an ischemic event and that features of astrocyte cell division are \nseen within 180 min (Petito, 1986), although numerous immuno-staining studies \nconsistently report a much slower onset of reactive changes (e.g., Davies et al., \n1998). The early timing of reactive astrocytosis is of particular importance in \nPage 4 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n5\ndeveloping white matter, which is subject to a spectrum of injuries that appear to \nbe largely ischemic in origin and which underlie cerebral palsy, a common birth \ndisorder (Volpe, 1995; Back and Rivkees, 2004). While there is controversy \nregarding the contribution of reactive astrocytosis to functional loss, it is clear that \nearly and rapid astrocyte death during the evolution of the developing white \nmatter lesion would be an important contribution factor to the pathophysiology of \nneighboring neurons and axons and that the subsequent depletion of normal \nastrocytes will severely jeopardize white matter function. It is also apparent that \nrapid astrocytosis might mask any early loss of astrocytes and disguise the \nimportance of acute astrocyte injury when post-mortem samples are analyzed.\nThe problem of studying acute reactive changes in developing white matter\nThe question of how the morphology of white matter astrocytes responds \nto ischemia can be addressed using traditional methods such as electron \nmicroscopy (EM) or immuno-histochemistry (IHC), although neither can be \napplied to a time series of the same cell. In terms of the level of morphological \ndetail that can be resolved EM is the superior technique. EM of control neonatal \nwhite matter astrocytes reveals their highly complex and ramified morphology \n(Fig 1 A), which includes thick primary processes, thinner secondary processes \nand finger processes that have a diameter of less than 50 nm in many cases. A \nlow power EM of the P10 optic nerve is shown in Fig 1 B, with 8 individual \nastrocytes shaded in different colors to illustrate the difficulty of identifying \nindividual astrocytes using standard microscopy techniques. It is apparent that \nPage 5 of 25 Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n6\ndepending upon the plane of section astrocytes may appear as nuclei with a very \nthin layer of cytoplasm, or that thick primary processes may be sectioned that \nhave all the morphological features of entire astrocytes (other than lacking a \nnucleus). Furthermore, the frequently very close apposition of astrocytes will \nmake it very hard to distinguish single cells at the level of light microscopy. All of \nthese problems are apparent when GFAP is immuno-labeled in long sections of \nthe optic nerve (Fig 1 C, top left) together with the nuclei within the section (Fig 1 \nC, bottom right), and the images overlaid (Fig 2 C, right). At this stage in \ndevelopment (P10) ~50% of the cells in the optic nerve are astrocytes (Thomas \net al., 2004), yet the double staining approach can positively identify only ~5% of \ncells as such (\"*\"). Of the remaining nuclei, some will be oligodendroglia and \nsome astrocytes, but the absence of clear GFAP staining around nuclei make it \nimpossible to distinguish them apart.\nFig 1 near here\nWhen this IHC approach is used to address changes in cell number, a 30 \nmin period of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by 180 min of recovery \nleads to the expected fall in nuclei number within the nerve (Fig 1 D). It is not \nclear however which cells are lost from the structure and which, if any, may be \ndividing and increasing in number. Likewise, no difference is found in GFAP \nimmuno fluorescence in control and post-OGD nerves (Fig 1 E), which may be \nPage 6 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n7\neither due to an absence of reactive astrocytosis, or a masking of this \nphenomenon by a simultaneous decline in astrocyte number due to acute injury. \nThe answer to the problem\nThe application of live cell imaging of GFP expressing astrocytes can \nresolve these problems. In Fig 2 A, GFP (+) astrocytes in isolated perfused P10 \nmouse optic nerve are imaged at 30 min intervals over a 210 min period. Control \nimages (no OGD) on the left illustrate the stability of the astrocytes under these \nconditions, and the degree of cell viability is plotted in \"B\" showing low levels of \ncell death. Three ischemic-type protocols are shown in Fig 2, a 20 and a 30 min \nperiod of OGD followed by reperfusion for 190 and 180 min respectively and a 30 \nmin period of perfusion with hypoxic acid-shifted Ringer solution (HAIR, see \nBondarenko and Chesler, 2001) which is designed to mimic the extracellular \nconditions known to exist in the brain during ischemia. In all three cases the \nnumber of GFP(+) astrocytes can be seen to decline following the insult, with \nsignificant cell loss at 30-40 min post insult in all three cases (Fig 2 B). In no case \nis there a subsequent rise in GFP (+) cell number in the nerves that would \nindicate cell division.\nFig 2 near here\nPrevious studies that have reported early reactive astrocytosis examined \nthe post-ischemic hippocampus (Petito, 1986). Using perfused brain slices the \nPage 7 of 25 Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n8\nGFP imaging approach can look at cell changes in these gray matter astrocytes, \nas shown in Fig 3. The protoplasmic GFP (+) hippocampal astrocytes have a \nmore restricted morphology at P10 than the fibrous optic nerve astrocytes, and \nare less ramified. The cells are stable during control perfusion (Fig 3 A, left), with \nneither 20 nor 30 min of OGD evoking any significant decline in astrocyte \nnumbers (Fig 3 B). It would appear, therefore, that in the neonatal brain white \nmatter astrocytes are far more sensitive to ischemic injury than their gray matter \nequivalents. The same graph reveals no increase in astrocyte number in the 180-\n190 min of reperfusion after the insult showing that the lack of acute astrocyte \ndivision is common to both brain regions.\nFig 3 near here.\nIt is apparent from Figures 2 and 3 that the GFP imaging approach not \nonly allows cell number to be measured in a time series but also provides \ninformation about cell morphology. Fig 4 A shows a time series of images of four \nP10 optic nerve astrocytes before, during and after a 30 min period of OGD. It is \napparent that in addition to loss of two of these cells following the insult there is \nalso marked loss of cell processes surrounding the somata. We have recently \ndescribed a simple approach to assessing changes in the density of GFP (+) \noligodendroglial processes in optic nerve (Salter and Fern, 2005) which we can \nalso apply to astrocytes. A region of interest is drawn around a somata-free zone \n(Fig 4 B) and mean pixel intensity if measured and plotted against time (Fig 4 C). \nPage 8 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n9\nThis analysis reveals marked process loss from astrocytes at 30-40 min post \nOGD in both 20 and 30 min OGD experiments. There is a significantly greater \ndegree of process loss following the longer period of OGD and in both cases the \nrate and degree of process loss is not significantly different from the loss of \nastrocyte somata shown in Fig 2.\nFigure 4 near here\nConcluding remarks\nThe mechanisms of acute injury of neonatal white matter astrocytes \ndepends upon the maturity of the tissue. Pre-myelinating astrocytes suffer a toxic \ncalcium influx that is mediated mainly by voltage-gated calcium channels and \nleads to rapid membrane breakdown (Fern, 1998). Later in development, \nfollowing the initiation of myelination, ischemic conditions fail to produce a toxic \ncalcium influx but instead evoke cytotoxic cell swelling that results in equally \nrapid loss of membrane integrity (Thomas et al., 2004). The absence of acute \nreactive changes at this latter developmental stage following a limited ischemic \nchallenge shown in the current study does not appear to be unique to the white \nmatter since a similar absence of reactive changes was found in their gray matter \ncousins. It does appear, however, that the astrocytes of actively myelinating \nwhite matter have a much heightened sensitivity to ischemic-type injury, in \nparticular in the reperfusion period after a brief period of an ischemic-type \ncondition. Differential sensitivity to ischemic conditions between gray matter \nPage 9 of 25 Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n10\nastrocyte populations are apparent in cell culture studies (Zhao and Flavin, 2000; \nXu et al., 2001), although such studies always require very protracted periods of \nmodeled ischemia and reperfusion to generate significant cell death at all.\nPage 10 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n11\nTable 1\nAstrocyte Injury evoked by ischemic-type conditions in vitro, in whole mount, and \nin vivo.\nSpecies, age Preparation Ischemia model Astrocyte \nInjury\nMethod Reference\nIn Vitro\nMouse, neonatal Cultured from \ncortex, 14-28 \nDIV\nOGD, 6hr + 1 day \nreperfusion\n~50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Goldberg and \nChoi, 1993)\nRat, foetal Cultured from \ncortex, 19-21 \nDIV\nOGD, 8 hr + 1 \nday reperfusion\n50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Zhao and \nFlavin, 2000)\nRat, foetal Cultured from \nhippocampal, \n19-21 DIV\nOGD, 2 hr + 1 \nday reperfusion\n50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Zhao and \nFlavin, 2000)\nMouse, neonatal Cultured from \ncortex, 21-30 \nDIV\nGlucose \ndeprivation, 12-18 \nhr + 1 day \nreperfusion\n50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Papadopoulos \net al., 1997)\nMouse, neonatal Cultured from \ncortex, 7-27 \nDIV\nOGD, 8-12 hr + 1 \nday reperfusion\n50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Papadopoulos \net al., 1998)\nRat, neonatal Cultured from \nwhole brain, \n12-21 DIV\nHypoxia-\nhypoglycaemia, 6 \nhr + 3 days \nreperfusion\n50% death LDH \nrelease\n(Lyons and \nKettenmann, \n1998)\nWhole mount\nRat, P2 Whole mount \noptic nerve\nOGD, 80 min ~50% death Live \nimaging\n(Fern, 1998)\nRat, P10 Whole mount \noptic nerve\nOGD, 45 min ~22% death Live \nimaging, \nEM\n(Thomas et al., \n2004)\nIn vivo\nRat, adult Cortex MCAO, 30 min Process loss IHC (Davies et al., \n1998)\nRat, adult Cortex MCAO, 60 min Cellular \ndisintegration\nIHC (Davies et al., \n1998)\nRat, adult Hippocampus Global ischemia, \n10 min + 1 day \nreperfusion\nSome \nastrocyte \ndeath\nIHC (Petito et al., \n1998)\nRat, adult Hippocampus Global ischemia, \n2-30 min+ 1 day \nLoss of \nGFAP \nEM (Petito and \nHalaby, 1993)\nPage 11 of 25 Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n12\nreperfusion reactivity\nRat, adult Pre-optic \narea\nMCAO, 30 min Cytoplasmic \ndisintegration\nIHC (Garcia et al., \n1993)\nRat, adult Cortex, Basal \nganglia\nMCAO, 2 hr + 4hr \nreperfusion\nLoss of \nGFAP \nreactivity\nIHC (Chen et al., \n1993)\nNeonatal pig Putamen Hypoxia-\nischemia, ~40 \nmin + 24-48 hr \nreperfusion\n~50% loss of \nGFAP (+) \ncells\nIHC (Martin et al., \n1997)\nHypertensive rat, \nadult\nCortex MCAO, 1-12 hr Loss of S-\n100, GFAP \nprotein and \nmRNA\nIHC (Liu et al., \n1999)\nRat, adult Cortex MCAO, 1-3 hr Loss of \nGFAP mRNA\nISH (Yamashita et \nal., 1996)\nRat, adult Visual cortex Photocoagulation, \n4 hr\nCytoplasmic \ndisintegration\nIHC (Schmidt-\nKastner et al., \n1993)\nOGD = Oxygen glucose deprivation, IHC = immuno-histochemistry, GFAP = glial \nfibliary acidic protein, MCOA = middle cerebral artery occlusion, EM = \nElectron microscopy, DIV = days in vitro\nPage 12 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n13\nFigure legends\nFigure 1\nThe problems of studying morphological changes in white matter \nastrocytes.

The aCSF was \nbubbled for at least 20 min before use with 95%O2\/5%CO2 to ensure a correct \npH of 7.4 and osmolarity was adjusted to 310-320 milliOsmols. All procedures \ninvolving the use of animals were approved by local ethical review. Data are \npresented as means \u00b1 SEM and statistical significance was tested using ANOVA \nwith Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post-test (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad \nSoftware Inc.).\nCell Imaging\nThe ends of the optic nerves were fixed to a cover slip using a small \namount of cyanoacrylate glue, leaving the majority of the nerve free of glue. The \ncover slip was then sealed to the bottom of a Plexiglas perfusion chamber \n(atmosphere chamber, Warner Instruments Corporation, Hamden, CT, USA) \nusing silicone grease (see Salter and Fern 2005 for further details). Control \nconditions were maintained with continual perfusion of the above aCSF, \n95%O2\/5%CO2 as the atmosphere within the chamber and temperature regulated \nto 37\u00baC using flow-through and objective heaters (see Fern 1998). Ischemic \nconditions were simulated by switching to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), \nachieved by perfusion with glucose-free aCSF that had been bubbled with \n95%N2\/5%CO2 for a minimum of 60 min while the atmosphere within the \nchamber was switched simultaneously to the same gas. \nPage 16 of 25Journal of Anatomy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\nFor Peer Review Only\n17\nThe reordering chamber was mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX70 \ninverted confocal microscope and the MON imaged with a 60x oil immersion \nobjective. Once control images had been collected, the conditions were switched \nto OGD for either 20 or 30 min, followed by 180-190 min of reperfusion under \nnormoxic\/normoglycaemic conditions. Image stacks of 21 planes 10 \u00b5m deep \nwere acquired every 30 min.
