Scope: monograph.\nLevel: undergraduate, postgraduate, and intelligent general reader.\nPeople have been fascinated by Mars since the beginnings of recorded history, and no\ndoubt they were equally intrigued in earlier eras too. Even before Galileo and the advent\nof the telescope in the seventeenth century, astronomers had charted the red planet\u2019s\nstrange looping motion across the sky \u2013 retrograde motion that seemed to require a hugely\ncomplicated description in terms of epicycles and deferents until Copernicus proposed his\nheliocentric Solar System. The introduction of the telescope (1609) produced a continuing\nflow of discoveries, especially during close approaches of Mars and Earth, e.g. in 1830\nleading to the first map of Mars, and in 1877 leading to the discoveries of the Martian\nsatellites Phobos and Deimos \u2013 and to Schiaparelli\u2019s observation of \u201ccanali\u201d, meaning\nchannels, but mistranslated into English as \u201ccanals\u201d implying waterways constructed by\nintelligent beings. These were of course artifacts due to the tendancy of the human eye to\n\u201crationalise\u201d by tryng to make sense of observations at the limit of the available resolution.\nBut they led to further intensive observation and to tantalysing fantasies by Lowell on the\nhistory of the supposed \u201cMartians\u201d. The next generation of discoveries started with the\ndespach of space probes to Mars by the USSR and USA in the 1960s. The first successful\nones were the Mariner fly-by missions, which returned high resolution images. Since then,\nthere have been both Mars orbiters and landers, returning information of a quality and\nquantity undreamt of in earlier times.\nNadine Barlow has pulled all of this information together in the form of a book. It\nencompasses all scientific aspects of the planet, including a brief introductory review\nof the pre-telescopic, and terrestial telescopic observations, and a summary of all 36\nmissions to Mars and what they consisted of: about two-thirds of them were partial\nor complete failures. The introductory chapter also discusses Mars\u2019 orbital properties,\nphysical properties, and Moons. It sets the scene nicely for what follows.\nSubsequent chapters provide a detailed account of what is now known about the\nplanet, its formation, its probable interior structure, surface properties, geology, its thin\natmosphere, and the 37 Martian meteorites known (as of 2006) to have reached Earth.\nThe author devotes a full chapter to discussing the history of water on Mars, which will be\nof particular interest to the general reader give its relevance to possible life on the planet.\nShe lays out the key questions very clearly. The amount of water needed to account for\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 49, 303-304 (2008).\nall the fluvially created surface features is estimated to correspond to a global layer of\naverage depth 400m. This is to be compared with the water thought to be locked up in\nthe polar icecaps (maximum 29.6m) and in the atmosphere (10\u22125m). So where has all\nthe water gone? There are two points to bear in mind. First, the very low atmospheric\npressure (see above) would not allow liquid water to exist for long: it would quickly boil\naway. Secondly, at present ambient temperatures (average around 210K), any H2O would\nbe in the form of ice anyway so that it can, in many respects, be considered as a just\nanother mineral or rock, albeit a rather low density one. The supposition is that the\nwater is still there, but underneath the present surface and maybe concentrated near the\npoles. Future probes planned by NASA will be fitted with equipment to dig holes to see\nwhether the excavated soil contains significant ice.\nThe author also looks to the future, and discusses the relative merits of robotic and\nmanned missions to Mars, concluding that a balanced mix will give the best scientific\nreturn \u2013 despite the obvious and ever-present dangers posed to humans by unexpected\nsolar flares.\nThe book is carefully constructed and very well written, and it immediately engages\nthe reader\u2019s interest. It is rather a pity that so many of of the figures had to be repro-\nduced in black-and-white, especially as one can remember some of them printed in colour,\nand larger, in newspapers. But Nadine Barlow\u2019s Mars is a treasure trove of information,\nsupported by numerous figures, photographs, tables, a very full bibliography and a de-\ntailed index. I anticipate that, on different levels, it will be read with enjoyment and\nfound useful by experts and non-experts alike. Of course, as the author points out, it will\ninevitably be outdated by forthcoming Mars missions, but that is all the more reason to\nread it now. The author\u2019s closing comments are worth quoting in full:\n\u201cOur growing realisation that early Mars was more Earth-like, with liquid\nwater, a thicker atmosphere, and warmer surface conditions leads me and\nmany of my colleagues to invstigate what happened to produce the cold dry\nplanet we see at present. Such knowledge will help us to be better caretakers\nof the blue orb that we call home.\u201d\nOne can only hope that she is right.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\n2\n"}
