Rather, it is certain ways of thinking about territory, particularly \nthose largely uncritical assumptions of International Relations and International Political Economy, that is \nthe problem. Those assumptions, which Agnew skilfully unpicked, actually require more, not less, work on \nterritory. We need to investigate not simply the implications of thinking within this trap\u2014how it constrains \nour thinking, and hamstrings our potential for critique\u2014but how it is produced. What we do when we \naccept the territorial trap is to buy-into a state-centred narrative that naturalises and normalises this way of \nthinking.\n2\n \n \nWhat do we mean when we talk of territory? There seem to be two dominant definitions in the literature. \nOne sees a territory as a bounded space, a container, under the control of a group of people, nowadays \nusually a state. The other sees a territory as an outcome of territoriality, a human behaviour or strategy. \nThese two definitions are, of course, not mutually exclusive.\n3\n Both are mentioned, en passant, in Agnew\u2018s \narticle. Yet neither definition really addresses the kinds of questions that Agnew is asking us to consider. \nHow did boundaries get drawn? Why should the space that they enclose be thought of as exclusive and \nlimited? Why are boundaries seen as dividing one polity from another, and therefore domestic from foreign \npolitics? Why do certain groups claim a monopoly of power within those lines, and how do they continue \nto hold this, and then later receive a legal basis for those claims? Why do those that wish to challenge this \nsituation\u2014self-determination movements, for instance\u2014not want a different system but their own stake \nwithin it? Why, today, are boundaries largely seen as fixed? In the argument being made here, territory \nmust be conceived as an historically and geographically specific form of political organization and political \nthought. It simply cannot be taken for granted, nor approached through the notion of territoriality, which \nlacks the historical and geographical specificity of territory, both as a practice and a form. \n \nIn a piece published the year after \u2017The Territorial Trap\u2018, but much less well-known, Agnew provided an \ninteresting gloss on this argument.\n4\n He was critical of two key assumptions that shaped debates in the mid \n1990s: the idea that social science had neglected space; and that there was a \u2017geographical turn\u2018 taking \nplace. Rather than being \u2017spaceless\u2018, he suggested, social science had long been filled with geographical \nterms and assumptions. One of these, of course, was the territorial trap. But, he argued, the reason that this \nthinking had become static and unable to cope with dynamics, change and transition was that \u2015social \nscience has been too geographical and not sufficiently historical, in the sense that geographical assumptions \nhave trapped consideration of social and political-economic processes in geographical structures and \ncontainers that defy historical change\u2016.5 \n \nOne way out of the territorial trap, then, is a historical investigation of how it came about. Agnew makes \nthe importance of this clear in the piece, but it has tended to be underplayed in those analyses that have \ncome in its wake.\n6\n While such a historical investigation could be done by tracing the ways that IR and IPE \nscholars have assumed things about, rather than thought about, territory, the way I am trying to pursue it is \nto trace the emergence of the term within Western political thought. This is generally done within the early \nmodern period\u2014Hobbes, Locke, Westphalia, etc.\u2014that is seen as the time of the birth of territorial states \nand the international system. As I have argued elsewhere, at this time, the linkage between territory and \nsovereignty can be found most clearly articulated in the work of Leibniz.\n7\n But it is important to realise that \nthe particular histories of specific territorial states postdates the articulation of the idea, which was worked \nthrough in inchoate form some time earlier. \n \nAlthough the word \u2017territory\u2018 regularly appears in translations of Thucydides, Aristotle, Caesar and Tacitus, \nthe Greek khora (in its unstressed sense of land, rather than the philosophical sense it has in Plato\u2018s \nTimaeus) or the Latin terra invoke a rather different set of possibilities. For those relatively rare \ninvocations in classical Latin of the term territorium, in Cicero, for instance, this was the land belonging to \na town or other community. It was understood as a possession, of relatively small scale, rather than as an \nobject of political rule. It is only in the mid-fourteenth century, with the rediscovery of Roman law in the \nItalian city-states, that the notion of territorium became explicitly tied to that of jurisdiction. The actions of \nan individual merchant, for instance, were bound by the laws of the place he was in, rather than by who he \n 2 \nwas. This was a crucial shift from the personality of law to the territoriality of law.\n8\n This idea was of great \nbenefit to the secular political theorists who were trying to articulate the scope of political rule in \nopposition to the universalising aspirations of the Pope. Ruling on his own involvement in internal French \npolitics, Pope Innocent III in 1202 had declared that \u2015the king recognised no superior in temporal matters\u2016.9 \nWhile Innocent was trying to stress that he still had supremacy in spiritual matters, he was outlining a \nmodel that the secular theorists would soon adopt. Jurists on behalf of the King then articulated his power \nin terms parallel with that of the Holy Roman Emperor\u2014within his kingdom, the King had the same \npowers as the Emperor in his Empire.\n10\n Fusing these two ideas together meant that the king was claiming a \nsupremacy of temporal power within his kingdom\u2014a spatial extent of power, a power which would later \nbecome theorised as sovereignty. The Emperor, the King or later the city-state held supremacy within their \nborders. Theirs was a geographically restricted power, but within those areas they held the ultimate control.  \n \nAs Agnew hints in \u2017The Territorial Trap\u2018, this is still some way from a modern state system of clearly \ndemarcated territories. The production of that system was worked out, both in the Europe where these ideas \nemerged and in divisions of the colonised world, over the next several centuries. While the idea that the \nruler had a monopoly of power within those boundaries became widely accepted, what those limits were \nwas not yet fixed. Kingdoms, empires, and, later, states, could conquer land through war or acquire it \nthrough purchase, or be punished by its loss in punitive peace settlements. It was not until the early \ntwentieth century that international conferences attempted to cement the territorial boundaries of states, \nbeginning in Western Europe with the 1925 Locarno Treaties, and then codified in the United Nations \nCharter.\n11\n Thus the international legal notion of territorial integrity brings together two distinct ideas\u2014\nterritorial sovereignty and territorial preservation. These terms have separate histories and their fusion was \nan attempt to create a stability in the post-World War II world. Today, with notions of humanitarian \nintervention and contingent sovereignty, they are being separated again. Boundaries may remain fixed, and \nconsiderable efforts may be undertaken to preserve existing territorial settlements\u2014witness the efforts in \nIraq and Afghanistan to prevent their breakup\u2014yet the sovereignty within them is held to be dependent on \nfollowing particular codes of behaviour.\n12\n If the latter explains the beginning of the wars launched by the \nUSA and its allies; the former partially accounts for their continued presence in those states. \n \nThis kind of historical approach, of which these overview points merely hint at the complexity, would seem \nanother way to approach the challenges Agnew laid down fifteen years ago. Territory, both as a concept \nand as a political reality, requires much more work and analysis if we are to understand its contemporary \nlimits and its historical and geographical conditions of possibility and specificity. Territory needs to be seen \nin relation to, but also in distinction from, two other terms, which themselves deserve careful analysis: land \nand terrain.\n13\n Territory as a political question is not simply political-economic or political-strategic, but \nrelates to developments in the law and the history of techniques such as land-surveying and cartography. \nTerritory is, to borrow Foucault\u2018s term, a political technology. Territory also needs to be seen in relation to \nthe category of \u2017space\u2018, the history of which is now, post-Lefebvre, widely accepted. Territory is, clearly, \nnot the only form of state space, much less political space. But it remains an important one. It is precisely \nbecause territory is a limited, historically specific, and non-exclusive way of spatial ordering, that it needs \nto be interrogated more thoroughly. All too often, and clearly contrary to Agnew\u2018s intent, the territorial trap \nhas been avoided by being ignored, not by being critically interrogated. Rather we should ask how \nparticular territorial settlements are produced, and how states operate in ways that normalise and perpetuate \nthis spatial order of things. And, more generally, why have we become inured to this sense of territory as \nsomething politically fixed and conceptually static? This kind of historical conceptual examination of the \nstate of territory might enable us to move beyond \u2017the territorial trap\u2018 rather than simply avoid it, because it \nmay help us to see how that trap was produced. \n \n 3 \nNotes \n \n1\n  John Agnew, \u2015The Territorial Trap: The Geographical Assumptions of International Relations \nTheory\u2016, Review of International Political Economy, Vol 1, 1994, pp. 53-80. \n2\n  This is an argument that Neil Brenner and I have made at length in \u2015Henri Lefebvre on State, \nSpace and Territory\u2016, International Political Sociology, Vol 3, 2009, forthcoming.  \n3\n  The best work on territory, to my mind, remains Jean Gottmann, The Significance of Territory, \nCharlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1973. I have also learned a great deal from two \nunfortunately untranslated books: Paul Alli\u00e8s, L\u2019invention du territoire, Grenoble: Presses \nUniversitaires de Grenoble, 1980; and Claude Raffestin, Pour une g\u00e9ographie du pouvoir, Paris: \nLibraires Techniques, 1980.
