Lett., 36, L21101, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040621.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The substorm is an intermittent, system-scale energy\nrelease event that occurs in the magnetosphere of the Earth\nand probably of other planets also [e.g., McPherron et al.,\n1973; Kronberg et al., 2007; Russell et al., 2008]. Since its\ndiscovery over forty years ago [Akasofu, 1964], scientists\nhave been intrigued and challenged by what causes its\nintermittency. The debate centres on whether, or in what\nproportions, onsets are endogenous (generated from within)\nor exogenous (generated from outside).\n[3] In one sense all substorm onsets are exogenous in that\nit was recognised early on that a necessary condition for the\nonset of a substorm is a preceding interval of southward\ninterplanetary magnetic field (IMF), known as the growth\nphase, during which energy from the solar wind is accu-\nmulated in the magnetotail [McPherron et al., 1973]. In the\ncontext of the current debate, exogenous refers to whether\nan additional influence from the solar wind is required for\nsubstorm onset. This additional influence, called an external\ntrigger, is usually postulated to be a northward turning of the\nIMF vector on a time scale very much shorter than the\ngrowth phase duration that coincides with, and is causally\nrelated to, the substorm onset [Caan et al., 1977]. Other\ntypes of external trigger have also been suggested related to\nrapid changes in the east-west component of the IMF\n[Troshichev et al., 1986] and solar wind dynamic pressure\n[Kokubun et al., 1977]. Various physical models that\naccommodate these triggers have been proposed [e.g.,\nLyons, 1995; Russell, 2000; Lui, 2001].\n[4] Besides numerous anecdotal reports of individual\nsubstorm onsets coinciding with a rapid northward turning\nof the IMF [e.g., Caan et al., 1977; Rostoker, 1983;\nBlanchard et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2006, and references\ntherein], the most objective evidence in favour of exoge-\nnous\/externally triggered substorms is based on results from\ntwo types of statistical analysis.\n[5] Firstly, statistical analyses of the relative timings of\ncandidate external triggers and substorm onsets have\nrevealed that they coincide significantly more frequently\nthan expected by random chance [Lyons et al., 1997; Hsu\nand McPherron, 2002]. However, it has been demonstrated\nrecently that this does not provide conclusive evidence that\nthe substorm onset is causally related to, or even statistically\nassociated with, a rapid northward turning of the IMF [Morley\nand Freeman, 2007]. This is because the definition of an\nexternal trigger included not only the requirement of a rapid\nnorthward turning of the IMF but also a prior interval of\nsouthward IMF, which is sufficient on its own to give the\nstatistical association; the additional requirement of a rapid\nnorthward turning of the IMF is not necessary. Indeed, it was\nfurther shown that the statistical association is reproduced well\nby a simple toy model of the substorm, known as the Minimal\nSubstorm Model (MSM) [Freeman and Morley, 2004], in\nwhich substorm onsets are endogenous by construction.\n[6] Secondly, superposed epoch analysis has shown that,\non average, the IMF turns northward close to substorm onset\n[Caan et al., 1978, hereafter CMR78]. This has been com-\nmonly accepted as evidence of the association and causal\nconnection of a rapid northward turning of the IMF and\nsubstorm onset [e.g., McPherron, 1979; Baker et al., 1996;\nBlanchard et al., 2000]. However, in this paper, we shall show\nthat, similarly to the first case above, the average tendency of\nthe IMF to becomemore northward close to substorm onset is\ndue to the average tendency of substorm onset to occur under\nsouthward IMF; the additional requirement of a rapid north-\nward turning of the IMF is not necessary.\n2. Method and Results\n[7] We use a superposed epoch analysis to make two tests\nof the null hypothesis:\n[8] H0 \u2013 The average tendency of the IMF to turn\nnorthward close to substorm onset is independent of a rapid\nnorthward turning of the IMF at onset.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L21101, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040621, 2009\n1British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\n2Centre for Space Physics, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New\nSouth Wales, Australia.\n3Now at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico,\nUSA.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040621\nL21101 1 of 4\n[9] Acceptance of H0 implies rejection of the hitherto\naccepted alternative hypothesis:\n[10] H1 \u2013 The average tendency of the IMF to turn\nnorthward close to substorm onset requires a rapid north-\nward turning of the IMF at onset.\n[11] The first test is designed to test whether H0 can be\nsatisfied purely by the bias of substorm onset to occur\nduring southward IMF, irrespective of a rapid northward\nturning of the IMF. The second test then extends this using\nthe MSM to investigate the influence of other plausible\nfactors affecting substorm onset, including the time history\nof the IMF and a magnetotail energy threshold but not the\nrapid northward turning of the IMF.\n[12] The IMF data set used in these tests comprises 1-min-\naveraged measurements made by the MAG instrument on the\nNASA Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft\nfrom 5 February 1998 to 7 May 2002. Data gaps of less than\n5 min were filled by linear interpolation. To avoid larger data\ngaps, we only used intervals of data that were unbroken for\n100 h or more.\n[13] The date range covers the ascending phase and\nmaximum of solar cycle 23, thereby including the equiva-\nlent phase of the solar cycle in 1967\u20138 during which the\nExplorer 33 and 35 spacecraft data used by CMR78 were\nrecorded. To make a direct comparison with their results,\ndata points were measured from the published superposed\nepoch analysis curve (the top trace from Caan et al. [1978,\nFigure 4]). The gross variation was captured by sampling at\n30 min resolution, with the shape of the peak requiring\ncoordinates to be noted at 10 min resolution. These data\nhave then been lagged by 35 min with respect to those\nshown by CMR78 to account for the delay between meas-\nurements of the IMF by the Explorer spacecraft and their\npossible influence on substorm onset in the magnetotail and\nsubsequent detection on the ground.\n[14] The lag places the minimum of the CMR78 super-\nposed epoch analysis curve approximately at the substorm\nonset time t = ti, and may be justified as follows: The delay\ncan be broken down into three parts T = T1 + T2 + T3. T1 =\n(Xs \u0002 Xo)\/V takes into account advection in the solar wind at\nspeed V of a phase front orthogonal to the Sun-Earth line\nfrom a spacecraft at X = Xs to a position on the magneto-\npause at X = Xo, where X is the position coordinate on the\nEarth-Sun line. T2 = Ro\/c is the time for the effect of the\nIMF at the magnetopause at X = Xo to affect the central\nmagnetotail and possibly trigger substorm onset, where Ro\nis the effective radius of the magnetotail and c is the\ncharacteristic propagation speed, which we take to be the\nAlfve\u00b4n speed. T3 is the time delay between the substorm\nonset in the magnetotail and its detection on the ground.\nChoosing Xo = 11 RE, corresponding to the subsolar\nmagnetopause, v = 400 km\/s, and 25 < Xs < 75 RE,\nappropriate to the part of the solar wind in which the\nExplorer spacecraft spent most of their time [e.g., Taylor\net al., 1968], we find 4 < T1 < 17 min, consistent with the\nestimate by CMR78 of about a 10 min delay between\nspacecraft and subsolar magnetopause. However, we esti-\nmate T1 to be greater than this because we expect that Xo\nshould correspond to a magnetopause position anti-sunward\nof the location of substorm onset. Assuming Ro = 25 RE and\nc = 500 km\/s appropriate to the mid-tail (\u000210 > X >\u000220 RE)\n[Mazur and Leonovich, 2006] gives T2 \u0003 5 min, and also\nassuming T3 = 2 min [Samson, 1995] we find the T =\n35 min delay corresponds to Xo\u0004\u000230 RE \u2013 at or beyond the\nexpected location of the near-earth neutral line [Baumjohann\net al., 2000].\n2.1. Test 1\n[15] We define a set of times {ti} (i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., N),\nselected randomly from the set of all times in the unbroken\nACE time intervals for which the north-south component of\nthe IMF is below some threshold: Bz(ti) \u0004 0.7 nT. This\ncriterion reflects the expected tendency of substorm onsets\nto occur during southward IMF, but without regard to a\nrequirement for a coincident rapid northward turning of the\nIMF. (The value of 0.7 nT rather than simply zero nT is\nchosen such that the average value of Bz(ti) is approximately\nequal to that in CMR78\u2019s study; see Figure 1b.) Whilst\nmost, if not all, of the times will not correspond to actual\nsubstorm onsets, the purpose of this test is to see whether\nthe average tendency of the IMF to turn northward imme-\ndiately after substorm onset arises generally from any set of\nevents that are biased to occur for southward IMF, irre-\nspective of a rapid northward turning of the IMF at event\nonset.\n[16] Figure 1a shows the resulting superposed epoch\nanalysis of the variation of IMF Bz with respect to the event\ntimes ti for N = 10,000. The heavy solid line shows the\nensemble mean. The upper and lower dotted lines show\nthe upper and lower quartiles of the ensemble, respectively.\nThe median is shown by a dashed line and can be seen to be\nvery similar to the mean. Figure 1a clearly shows an average\ntendency of the IMF to become more northward immedi-\nately after event onset, qualitatively similar to the results of\nCMR78. This suggests acceptance of the null hypothesis H0\nbecause it shows that this tendency could be explained\npurely by the bias of substorm onset to occur during\nsouthward IMF, independent of a rapid northward turning\nof the IMF at substorm onset.\n[17] Figure 1b presents a more direct comparison with the\nsuperposed epoch analysis results of CMR78. The dia-\nmonds show the data points measured by us from the\npublished superposed epoch analysis curve, as described\nabove, and the dashed curve is a cubic spline interpolation\nof these points. The heavy solid line shows the mean\nvariation of IMF Bz with respect to the 10,000 event times\nused in Figure 1a, but with a random time lag added to the\nevent times, drawn from a normal distribution with a\nstandard deviation of 8 min. This lag simulates the effect\nof observational uncertainty in the timing of the substorm\nonset with respect to the IMF signal in CMR78\u2019s study. The\n8 min value approximately optimizes the agreement be-\ntween the test curve and CMR78\u2019s results and seems\nplausible given the various sources of random error in the\nsatellite to ground delay T calculated above. For example,\nthe variation in Xs quoted above alone causes T to vary by\n13 min. The light solid line shows the mean variation of\nIMF Bz for a subset of 1153 event times randomly selected\nfrom those that yielded the heavy line. This is the same\nnumber of event times as in CMR78\u2019s study, and thus\nillustrates the likely statistical variability.\n[18] Comparing the superposed epoch analysis curves of\nTest 1 with that from CMR78, we see that the average\nvariation of IMF Bz with respect to substorm onset, and\nL21101 FREEMAN AND MORLEY: INCONCLUSIVE TRIGGERING EVIDENCE L21101\n2 of 4\nespecially the tendency of the IMF to begin a northward\ntrend at substorm onset, is reproduced closely and likely\nwithin statistical uncertainty. Consequently we conclude\nthat there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis H0 that\nthe average tendency of the IMF to turn northward close to\nsubstorm onset is independent of a rapid northward turning\nof the IMF at onset.\n2.2. Test 2\n[19] We define a set of times {ti} (i = 1, 2, 3, . . ., N)\ncorresponding to substorm onset times generated by the\nMSM, in which (by design) there is no requirement for a\nnorthward IMF turning to trigger substorm onset. Instead,\nsubstorm onset occurs when solar wind energy input rea-\nches a constant critical energy threshold following a prior\nsubstorm in which an amount of energy is lost that is\nproportional to the solar wind power input at the time of\nthat substorm onset. (Note that, in this case, the actual value\nof the energy threshold is arbitrary; see Freeman and\nMorley [2004, section 2].)\n[20] The MSM is driven by the time series of the solar\nwind epsilon function, derived from actual measurements of\nthe solar wind speed and IMF made by the SWEPAM and\nMAG instruments, respectively, on the ACE spacecraft (the\nsame IMF data set as used in Test 1 above). The resultant\nprobability distribution of waiting times between substorm\nonsets is the same as that found from observations by\nBorovsky et al. [1993] (see Freeman and Morley [2004]\nfor more details). Selecting the date range 22 January 1999\nto 12 December 2000 in order to closely match the overall\nduration and solar cycle phase of CMR78\u2019s study yields N =\n1290 substorm onsets, which is also conveniently similar to\nthe number of onsets in CMR78\u2019s study (N = 1153).\n[21] The average variation of IMF Bz with respect to the\nMSM substorm onset times, in the same format as Figure 1\n(but omitting the curve equivalent to the light solid line in\nFigure 1b because the total number of MSM substorm\nonsets is already similar to that of CMR78\u2019s study). In this\ncase, a random normally-distributed lag with a standard\ndeviation of 20 min has been added to the MSM times to\napproximately optimize the agreement between the test\ncurve and CMR78\u2019s results in Figure 2b.\n[22] As in Test 1, the results suggest acceptance of the\nnull hypothesis H0 because they reproduce the average\ntendency of the IMF to begin a northward trend at substorm\nFigure 1.

Discussion and Conclusions\n[23] Contrary to what is commonly thought, we have\nshown that the superposed epoch analysis of CMR78 does\nnot provide empirical support for the hypothesis that sub-\nstorm onsets are externally triggered by a rapid northward\nturning of the IMF.\n[24] Instead, the average tendency of the IMF to begin a\nnorthward trend at substorm onset can be explained purely\nby the known bias of substorms to occur during southward\nIMF, e.g., when Bz \u0004 c, a constant \u0005 0. In this case \u2013 our\ntest 1 \u2013 the superposed epoch analysis curve is constrained\nto be less than c at t = ti by definition (and c was chosen\nsuch that the mean of Bz(ti) is approximately equal to the\nminimum value of the Caan et al. curve). However, at\nsufficiently large lags, the memory of this constraint is lost\nand the curve must approach the long-term average Bz \u0003 0.\nConsequently, it is inevitable that the superposed epoch\nanalysis curve will turn systematically northward after any\nevent onset that is biased to southward IMF.\n[25] More realistically, the requirement of a growth phase\nmeans that substorm onsets occur when the IMF has been\nsouthward for some time (\u00051 h). Comparison of Test 2\n(Figure 2a) with Test 1 (Figure 1a) shows the effect of this\nadditional requirement in that the average Bz is more\nnegative from about 25 min prior to event onset (and\n\u00030.5 nT lower at t = ti), but beyond about 25 min on either\nside of event onset the average variation in Bz is very\nsimilar.\n[26] After taking into account various observational con-\nsiderations (Figures 1b and 2b), the growth phase alone is a\nnecessary and sufficient substorm condition to reproduce\nclosely the superposed epoch analysis results of CMR78.\nThe additional requirement of a rapid northward IMF\nturning at substorm onset is unnecessary. The same equiv-\nalent conclusion has also been reached from a different\nanalysis method \u2013 the statistical association of substorm\nonsets with rapid northward turnings of the IMF [Morley\nand Freeman, 2007]. Thus, whilst the hypothesis of exog-\nenous\/externally triggered substorms seems physically plau-\nsible and is still possible, the two main statistical analyses\npurported to support the hypothesis have been shown to be\ninconclusive. Instead, in the absence of other evidence,\nparsimony favours the simpler null hypothesis of endoge-\nnous substorms.\n[27] Acknowledgments.
