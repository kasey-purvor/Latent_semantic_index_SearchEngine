In the main, the water used for irrigation comes from groundwater, and\nmuch of this can be classified as moderately saline. A survey was carried out of 60 cabbage farmers in\n5 regions of the country to identify the level of salinity of irrigation water and the irrigation practices used.\nIt was concluded that there was no relationship between the irrigation rate (average irrigation depth\ndivided by average irrigation interval) and the salinity of the water used or the salinity of the soil, such\nthat some farmers were over-irrigating and others under-irrigating. This means that water is being\nwasted and yields are likely to be reduced. In addition, there is a risk of long-term build-up of salinity and\nsoil degradation.\nKeywords: Irrigation; scheduling; salinity; cabbage; Botswana.\nIntroduction\nBotswana is a landlocked country located between 18 - 27\u00b0S and 20 - 30\u00b0E in\nsouthern Africa with an average elevation of 1 000 m above sea level. The climate is\nsemi-arid with a cool dry season between May and September and a hot wet season\nbetween October and April. The average annual precipitation of 450 mm is\nunreliable and unpredictable, whilst the average annual reference evapotranspiration\nis 1400 mm and exceeds average precipitation in every month (FAO, 1984).\nAbout 85% of the land is covered by the Kalahari sands and shrub savannah with the\ndriest region towards the south characterised by active sand dunes and very sparse\nvegetation. Water resources are extremely scarce in many parts of the country. The\npotential of using surface water for irrigation development in Botswana is limited as\nall the rivers within the country are either dammed, or planned for damming, for\ndomestic water use or livestock watering. In 2002, only 1 439 ha were irrigated, of\nwhich only 620 ha were irrigated in the dry season (FAO, 2005).\nAlmost all irrigation is for horticultural crops (FAO, 2005) - mainly varieties of\nbrassica, tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) and onions (Allium cepa) - and\nirrigation is essential for vegetable cropping (Bok et al., 2003). Most irrigation uses\ngroundwater from deep (>10 m below ground level) aquifers (Department of Water\nAffairs, Pers. Com.) with poor recharge and moderate levels of salinity (Tahal\nConsulting Engineers, 2000). The country has the potential to produce 75% of its\nnational demand of horticultural produce but produces only 20% (Tahal Consulting\nEngineers, 2000).\nCabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is grown in two cropping seasons. A crop\nmay be planted between March and May so that it grows through the winter months\n(May to August) and a summer crop may be planted between October and\n2November. Most that grow cabbage also grow other vegetables alongside or in\nrotation.\nCabbage is moderately sensitive to the salinity of irrigation water. Ayers and Westcot\n(1985) suggest a threshold electrical conductivity of irrigation water, ECw, of 1.2 dS\nm-1 for maximum yield and Beltr\u00e3o et al., (2000) found that yields decreased linearly\nwith increasing ECw above 2 dS m-1. Maggio et al., (2005) and Jamil et al., (2005)\nboth observed significant reductions in head fresh weight with irrigation water with an\nECw around 4 dS m-1 associated with reduced leaf area and above ground dry\nmatter.\nIf salts added to the soil through irrigation water are not adequately leached, the level\nof soil salinity will gradually increase. The salinity of the soil is usually expressed as\nthe electrical conductivity of the saturation extract, ECe, and Maas and Grattan\n(1999) suggest a threshold value of 1.8 dS m-1 for maximum yield of cabbage. Above\nthis threshold, head fresh weight was estimated to decline at a rate of 9.7% \/ dS m-1\n(Maas and Grattan, 1999).\nIn Botswana, rainfall is insufficient to leach salts from the soil profile. For sustainable\nproduction, additional irrigation water over and above the crop water requirements\nshould be applied according to the salinity of the irrigation water in order to avoid\nexcessive accumulation of salts in the soil (Maas and Grattan, 1999). FAO and\nMinistry of Agriculture (1998) concluded that inadequate investigation and \/ or poor\ndesign has resulted in inefficient operation and the use of saline water in some\nirrigation schemes. Many farmers have limited irrigation management experience and\nare poorly informed about irrigated agriculture. This paper reports on a survey of\ncabbage farmers in Botswana that aimed to identify whether, and how, cabbage\nfarmers in Botswana adapt their irrigation management according to the salinity of\nthe water used.\nMethodology\nClimate\nClimate data from Gaborone, Jwaneng, Mahalapye, Francistown and Maun were\nused to represent the climate of each region (Table 1). Average monthly reference\nevapotranspiration, ETo, was calculated from average monthly met data from the\nFAO CLIMWAT database with the Penman-Monteith method, except for Jwaneng,\nwhere average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures were used with the\nHargreaves method for reference evapotranspiration, calibrated against the other\nfour stations (see Allen et al., (1998) for methods). The crop water requirement of\ncabbage at full ground cover, ETc, was estimated using assuming a crop coefficient\nof 1.05 (Allen et al., 1998).\n3Figure 1 Average (1989 \u2013 2002) monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\nfor five stations in Botswana.\nFarmer survey\nAn on-farm survey was conducted between June and September 2004 in five of the\nsix agricultural regions of the country. The farmers selected all grew cabbage using\nirrigation water drawn from boreholes. Information was collected on;\n1) Farm identity; name, size, location, years of operation.\n2) Crop; crops grown, depth and methods of cultivation, area allocated to cabbage.\n3) Irrigation; method, duration and interval.\n4) Soil and water salinity; Electrical conductivity of irrigation water, ECw and root zone\nsoil water, ECs. Farmers\u2019 perception of the salinity.\nIrrigation practices\nThe typical application rate and depth applied was assessed in the field according to\nthe irrigation system used.\nHand irrigation refers to a system whereby farmers apply water using portable\ncontainers (e.g. watering cans, buckets). The depth of water applied was estimated\nfrom the volume of the container used for irrigation, the area of the bed and the\nnumber of containers applied at each irrigation.\nWhere the farmer was using a number of sprinklers on a lateral, five catch-cans were\nplaced at equal intervals (of at most 3 m) depending on the sprinkler spacing,\nbetween two sprinklers. The catch-cans were left until each one of them had\ncollected at least 50 ml. The volume of water collected in each can and the time\ntaken were recorded.\nWhere the farmer was using a single sprinkler and moving it around, the radius of the\nwetted circle was measured. Five catch-cans were placed at equal intervals in the\ndirection of the sprinkler move from the sprinkler to the end of the wetted soil. The\ncans were left in place and the sprinkler moved as normal until the sprinkler had past\n4all the cans and no more water was collected in any one of them. The volume and\ntaken to collect the water in each can was recorded.\nWhere the farmers were using drip irrigation, catch-cans were placed under the first\nand last emitters of the first, middle and the last laterals. Cans were left to stand until\nthe amount of water collected was at least 50 ml. The time taken to collect the water\nwas noted and the irrigation depth at each irrigation was estimated.\nIn order to compare irrigation systems, the average irrigation rate was estimated as\nthe amount of water applied at each irrigation divided by the average interval\nbetween irrigations.\nSoil and water salinity\nECw was measured using a portable conductivity meter. For hand irrigation, water\nwas collected from the water source whereas for drip and sprinkler irrigation, the\nwater collected in the catch-cans was tested.\nThree different positions in the field were chosen for soil sampling. The first position\nwas within the plant row, the second one between the rows and the last one at the\nedge of the cropped area. At each position, a hole was dug to 0.5 m (estimated as\nthe effective rooting depth). Soil samples were taken at the soil surface, 0.12, 0.25,\n0.37, and 0.5 m below the soil surface. About 300 g of soil from each depth was\ncollected in a sampling bag. The soil textural class was identified by feel.\nThe soil samples were taken to the laboratory, a saturation extract prepared (U.S.\nSalinity Laboratory Staff, 1954) and ECe was measured using a conductivity meter.\nStatistical analysis\nAll attribute data analysed in the project was tested using the chi-square test. Unless\notherwise stated, all the measurement data was analysed using the Duncan multiple\nrange test (DMRT), and all the error bars in the figures represent the range of 95 %\nconfidence interval. All tests were done at the alpha level of 0.05.\nResults\nClimate\nAverage long term (1989 \u2013 2002) monthly rainfall and reference evapotranspiration\nare shown in Table 1. All the regions are characterised by a summer rainy season\nfrom October to March and a dry winter. At all the stations, average precipitation is\nlower than average reference evapotranspiration throughout the year (Figure 1).\n5Table 1 Number of farmers, dates during which each agricultural region was visited for\ninterview and average climate for five agricultural regions in Botswana.\nMet Station Annual\nrainfall\n(1989 \u2013\n2002)\nAnnual\nETo\nAgricultural\nRegion\nDates\nof\nVisit\n(2004)\nNo.\nFarmers\nName Location Alt,\nm\nMean,\nmm\nCV\n%\nMean,\nmm\nGaborone 14 \u2013\n26\/6\n10 Gaborone 24.40\u00b0 S,\n25.55\u00b0 E\n994 525.7 36% 1 536.6\nSouthern 5 \u2013\n10\/7\n10 Jwaneng 24.60\u00b0 S,\n24.66\u00b0 E\n1189 443.5 34% 1 593.6\nCentral 2 \u2013\n14\/8\n20 Mahalapye 23.05\u00b0 S,\n28.48\u00b0 E\n1006 448.2 29% 1 567.1\nFrancistown 16 \u2013\n21\/8\n10 Francistown 21.13\u00b0 S,\n27.30\u00b0 E\n1000 459.5 40% 1 689.8\nNorth West 6 \u2013\n11\/9\n10 Maun 19.59\u00b0 S,\n23.25\u00b0 E\n994 407.5 33% 1 671.8\nCabbage cropping\nIn all regions, most farmers were growing cabbage in the winter and only 18% of the\nfarmers interviewed also grew cabbage in the summer. 85% of the farmers had been\ngrowing cabbage for five years or less. With an average farm size of 2.8 ha (ranging\nfrom 0.1 ha to 30 ha), the area of farm land planted with cabbage varied from 0.006\nha to 5 ha with an average of 0.66 ha per farm. Soil texture varied from clay to sand\nand there was no significant difference between the soil type used for growing\ncabbage in the different regions.\nAll the farmers interviewed produced crops using only light cultivation and none were\nusing mulch after the crops were transplanted. No farm had a subsurface drainage\nsystem.\nIrrigation systems\nThe irrigation systems used varied significantly between the regions. In Gaborone,\nNorth West and Southern Regions, more farmers used sprinklers whereas in\nFrancistown Region and Central Region hand irrigation and drip irrigation\nrespectively were most common (Figure 2).\n6Figure 2 Proportion of farms using different irrigation systems in each region.\nIrrigation management\nFarmers based their irrigation scheduling on observation of the soil or crops. They\ndid not schedule irrigation independently for the different crops they grew and they\nirrigated different crops with the same irrigation depth and interval. Only 22% of the\nfarmers changed their irrigation schedule between growing seasons.\nThe average irrigation interval was 3 days (range 1 \u2013 7 days) and the average\napplication depth was 13 mm (range 3 \u2013 45 mm) (Figure 3). On average, farmers\nusing sprinklers used larger applications (p = <0.001) and longer intervals (p =\n<0.001) than those using drip irrigation. The applications and intervals used by those\nirrigating by hand were not significantly different from those using the other two\nmethods (Figure 4).\nFigure 3 Irrigation depth and interval for different irrigation methods.\n7Figure 4 Average application depth (mm\/d) by irrigation system for cabbage farmers in\nBotswana.\nFigure 5 Average application depth and average summer and winter crop\nevapotranspiration (ETc) in five agricultural regions of Botswana.\n8On average, the cabbage farmers surveyed were irrigating at an average of\n5.3 mm\/d and there was no significant difference in the average application rates\nbetween irrigation systems (Figure 4) or region (Figure 5).\nSoil and water salinity\nThere was no significant difference in irrigation water salinity between the regions\n(Figure 6). Although most of the farmers said that they knew the salinity status of\ntheir water, none of them had done any scientific test \u2013 they estimated the salinity\nstatus either by tasting the water or observing white deposits on the soil. Most of the\nfarmers in Central Region believed that the water they used for irrigation was salty\nwhereas in Southern and in North West Regions most farmers believed that it was\nnot. In the Gaborone Region, most farmers said that they did not know the salt status\nof their irrigation water. Figure 7 shows that most farmers did not have a good\nunderstanding of the salinity status of the irrigation water. The average ECw of the 23\nfarmers who believed that they had saline water is only slightly higher than that of the\n29 farmers who believed that their water was not saline. However the large ranges\non Figure 7 suggest that many farmers had an incorrect perception of their water\nstatus. None of the farmers who believed that their water was salty was doing\nanything about it.\nFigure 6 Average irrigation water salinity for five regions in Botswana.\n9Figure 7 Actual irrigation water salinity for the farmers\u2019 perception groups.\nThe average ECe was 3.7 dS m-1 and was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the\nCentral Region (6.3 dS m-1) than Francistown, Gaborone and Southern Regions\n(Figure 8). There was no significant difference in root zone salinity between the soil\ntypes (Figure 9). From Figure 10, it is clear that most of the farmers did not know the\nsalinity status of their soil. Only 4 farmers believed that their soil was saline but there\nwas no significant difference in average soil salinity between the groups. As with\nirrigation water, those who believed that their soil was salty, said that they were doing\nnothing about it. There was no significant relationship between the amount of\nirrigation water applied per day and the electrical conductivity of the soil water extract\n(Figure 11).\n10\nFigure 8 Average soil salinity for five regions in Botswana.\nFigure 9 Average soil salinity by soil texture class.\n11\nFigure 10 Actual soil salinity for the farmers\u2019 perception groups.\nFigure 11 Relationship between average irrigation depth applied and soil salinity, ECe.\nECe was significantly correlated with ECw (p < 0.001) and farmers using higher\nsalinity irrigation water had higher soil salinity (Figure 12) although the predictive\npower of the regression is weak (r2 = 0.27). There was no significant relationship\n12\nbetween the soil salinity and the number of years the farms had been cropped except\nin Francistown region, where the correlation was weak (p = 0.050), as most farmers\nhad not been growing irrigated vegetables for many years.\nFigure 12 Relationship between electrical conductivity of the irrigation water, ECw, and\nsoil water extract, ECe, showing classification for irrigation water suitability (Ayers and\nWestcot, 1985) and yield thresholds for soil salinity (after Maas and Grattan, 1999).\nDiscussion\nNone of the cabbage farmers surveyed used any form of scientific method to\nschedule their irrigation and their practices have been based on experience.\nAlthough those using sprinklers tended to put on larger applications at longer\nintervals than those using drip irrigation, the differences in average application rate\n(depth x interval) do not appear to be related to any of the factors studied. During the\nsummer and winter seasons, the average crop water requirements of cabbage at full\nground cover are 5.7 and 3.5 mm\/d respectively. 40% of those surveyed were\napplying, on average, less and 38% more water than the winter and summer crop\nwater requirements respectively. There was a lot of variability in the irrigation depth\nwithin each region as shown by the error bars and the average irrigation depth did\nnot vary significantly between agricultural regions.\nSixty-eight percent of those surveyed were growing cabbage in soils with an ECe\nhigher than the 1.8 dS m-1 threshold for maximum yield (Maas and Grattan, 1999).\nSimilarly, 68% of the water sources tested fell within the \u201cslight to moderate\nrestriction\u201d range of 0.7 - 3 dS m-1 (Ayers and Westcot, 1985) and the average ECw\nwas 1.1 dS m-1. Only one site, of the 60 tested, fell into the \u201csevere\u201d category. A\nsignificant relationship was found between ECw. and ECe but this did could only\nexplain a small proportion of the variability in ECe. As ECe did not differ significantly\nwith soil type and the water table was too deep to contribute to the root zone salinity,\nwe suggest that irrigation water was the source of salinity, but the level of\n13\naccumulated of salt in the root zone depended on the cropping and irrigation history\nof the individual site.\nThe average irrigation rate was unrelated to irrigation water or soil salinity (Figure 13\nand Figure 11) and in all the regions there were farmers who may be considered to\nbe under- or over-irrigating in relation to the salt content of the water. Therefore, the\nmass of salts added to the soil in a season and the amount leached out will have\ndiffered from farm to farm. On many sites the long term sustainability of cropping\nmay be jeopardised by poor irrigation management.\nFigure 13 Relationship between average irrigation depth applied and irrigation water\nquality, ECe, showing classification for irrigation water suitability (Ayers and Westcot,\n1985) and average summer and winter crop water use, ETc.\nMost of the farmers believed they knew the salinity status of their irrigation water,\nhowever, many were wrong and none were deliberately changing their irrigation\npractices to account for salinity. The reasons being that either they felt that there was\nnothing they could do or they needed advice to know what to do. Farmers who\nbelieved that they were growing cabbage on saline soil said they were doing nothing\nabout it.\nMost of the farmers surveyed did not own the land. Furthermore, the person who\nfarms a given plot of land changes often and each farmer brings new ideas and\npractices. So the information in this paper is based on the irrigation management\npractices at the time of survey (that is the winter of 2004) and may not reflect the full\nirrigation history of the sites. The estimation of irrigation depths was a single\nmeasurement at the time of the interview, which may or may not have been an\naccurate representation of typical practice due to daily variations in wind speed or\npressure or the filling of the container used for irrigation. Similarly soil sampling for\nthe electrical conductivity tests was done only once in the season when the crops\nwere at different growth stages. As such, the soil had received different amounts of\nwater (and salt) for the season. However, these limitations have to be traded against\n14\nthe size of the survey which represents over 20% of the dry-season irrigated area of\nBotswana.\nConclusions\nThe survey of 60 cabbage farmers in five agricultural regions of Botswana revealed a\nwide range of irrigation management practices. In particular the range of average\nirrigation application was wide with some farmers under- and others over-irrigating.\nMost were using irrigation water that had a \u201cslight to moderate\u201d restriction on use for\nirrigation and two-thirds were growing cabbage in soil that was above the salinity\nthreshold for maximum yield. In the long-term, those using the highest salinity\nirrigation water and applying the lowest irrigation rates may be contributing to\ndegradation of soil resources (Tedeschi and Dell\u2019Aquila, 2005). Most of the farmers\ninterviewed have been growing cabbage for fewer than five years, and therefore lack\nthe experience to understand the impact of poor irrigation management. There is\nclearly a need for better communication of best practices and framer training in\nirrigation management.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Department of Agriculture Research, Botswana;\nthe Extension Services of the Ministry of Agriculture, Botswana and the farmers who\nparticipated in the survey for their support.
