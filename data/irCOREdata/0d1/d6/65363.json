Our investigation sought to demonstrate whether this correlation \nreflects computations performed in the primary visual cortex or feedback effects from \nshape processing area LO. We explored this in a patient who has a bilateral lesion to LO, \nbut a functionally spared V1. Our data indicate that illusory contours are unable to \ninfluence behaviour without visual area LO. Whilst we would not claim that our data \nprovide evidence for the \u201ecognitive\u201f nature of illusory contours, they certainly suggest \nthat illusory contours are dependent upon the computations involved in extracting shape \nrepresentations in LO. Our data highlight the importance of neuropsychological data in \ninterpreting the role of feedforward and feedback effects in the generation of visual \nillusions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTypical illusory contours result when the visual system modally completes a \nsurface whose presence is implied by the removal of corners from real objects (see Figure \n1 for the example of the stimuli used in the current study).  It is unclear whether these \nillusions result from local computations involved in the visual system\u201fs attempt to extract \nedges from the visual scene or from a higher-level interpretation of the possible shapes \nthat could cause that pattern of visual input (\u201ccognitive contours\u201d: Gregory 1972). Recent \nneuroimaging studies, using stimuli identical to those employed in this paper, have \nshifted the debate on illusory contours by demonstrating that they activate early visual \nareas (Seghier et. al., 2000). Of course this result does not preclude the possibility that \nthese activations develop from feedback arising at higher levels of the visual system.  \n \n \nFigure 1: Moving Kanizsa Stimulus.  \nThe stimuli were displayed on a Taxan Ergovision 8855LR (600 x 800 pixels) monitor, \ndriven by a Cambridge Research Systems VSG 2\/5 graphics system at 100 Hz. Each \nframe was presented in the centre of a black screen for 300ms. Each \u201cpac-man\u201d \nsubtended 1.5 degrees of visual angle. \n \nThe neurological patient D.F. provides an opportunity to test the role of different \nareas in computing illusory contours. D.F. has a visual form agnosia resulting from \nbilateral damage to the putative shape processing area LO (James et al. 2003). D.F.\u201fs \nability to perceive visual form is extremely limited, and her perceptual system is unable \nto make even very basic form discriminations. On the other hand it is also clear that \nD.F.\u201fs primary visual cortex is functionally spared, and is able to perform a number of \nimportant computations: it can supply information to guide manual actions (Milner and \nGoodale 1995), enables the perception of motion direction, the segmentation of figure-\nground relationships (Carey et al., 2006) and the integration of chromatic and orientation \ninformation (Humphrey et al., 1991). \nThis pattern of impaired and preserved function allows us to ask whether \ncomputations performed in the primary visual cortex are sufficient for creating illusory \ncontours. Indeed D.F.\u201fs preserved motion perception allows us to use a variation of the \nillusory contour phenomenon in which the contours give rise to a percept of motion (see \nFigure 1). If orientation and segmentation processing in D.F.\u201fs primary visual cortex are \nsufficient to generate this illusory stimulus then they should evoke, or at least influence, \nher motion perception. \nBefore exploring D.F.\u201fs ability to perceive the motion of an illusory square, it was \nnecessary to establish that she can perceive the motion of a real black square (presented \nwithout the \u201epac-men\u201f inducers, at the same speed and size as the illusory square). D.F. \nwas not perfect at this, but did achieve an accuracy of 90% on 2 blocks of 24 trials. She \nwas then presented with 4 blocks of 24 trials of illusory motion. D.F. certainly did not \nexperience the compelling perception of motion experienced by normal observers \u2013 she \nfelt she was guessing. Her guesses were, however, above chance, averaging 60.4%. On a \ntwo-tailed binomial test this performance is almost significant (N=96, p=0.082). Thus \nD.F.\u201fs pattern of performance could be taken to suggest that despite the complete \nbilateral disruption to LO, she is still able to extract sufficient information to represent \nillusory contours and for those contours to bias her motion discrimination. \nIn the next series of observations we had two aims: the first was to establish the \nreliability of the trend reported above. The second aim was to establish whether or not \nthis near-significant performance could be explained by any means other than the \nextraction of illusory contours.  \n \n Figure 2: The local rotation confound in the motion stimulus of Figure 1.  \nThe control stimuli on the right contain a local rotation cue but no subjective square. \n \n \nOn viewing Figure 2 it becomes apparent that when the illusory square moves up \nthe screen all the \u201cpac-men\u201d on the left rotate anti-clockwise while those on the right \nrotate clockwise, and vice-versa when the illusory square is seen to move down the \nscreen. We therefore constructed a control stimulus in which this local rotation confound \nremains present, but there is no global illusory motion. If D.F.\u201fs performance on the \nglobal motion stimulus is in fact based on this local rotational cue than she should also be \nabove-chance in her judgement of the local rotation control stimulus. \nD.F. was presented with 11 blocks of 24 trials using the original illusory motion \nstimulus. Her performance was slightly lower than previously (58%), but with the larger \nsample a two tailed binomial test revealed that this reached significance (N=246, \np=0.011). However when presented with 19\n1\n blocks of 24 trials employing the local \nrotation cue alone D.F. was also able to perform significantly above chance (57%, \nN=432, p=0.004). Critically a Fisher\u201fs exact test between the performance associated \nwith each stimulus type revealed that her performance on the two tasks did not differ \n(N=696, p=0.813).  \nThus whilst D.F. has a functioning primary visual cortex that enables her to \nperceive figure-ground relationships and enables an implicit processing of orientation, \nshe is unable to perceive this normally compelling motion illusion generated by illusory \ncontours. Indeed D.F. is not only unable to perceive this illusion she is also unable to \nguess at the direction of motion, when an appropriate stimulus is used as a control \nbaseline. In reviewing fMRI studies of the neural substrates activated by illusory \ncontours, Seghier and Vuilleumier (2006) highlight a range of different areas, including \nV1, area LO, and the right fusiform gyrus. Although informative, these neuroimaging \ndata cannot tell us where the critical computations responsible for the illusion take place. \nD.F. shows functional activations in both V1 (James et al. 2003) and right fusiform gyrus \n(Steeves et al., 2006) but has a clear anatomical disruption to, and indeed shows no \nfunctional activation in, area LO (James et al. 2003). The current findings therefore \n                                                 \n1\n The uneven number of blocks (11 for the original and 19 for this control) occurred because of time \nconstraints in testing the patient. \nsuggest that area LO is critical to the generation of illusory contours. The orientation \nprocessing and segmentation mechanisms evidently supported by D.F.\u201fs primary visual \ncortex are insufficient in themselves to support the formation of illusory contours. Thus \nalthough Seghier and colleagues (2000) have demonstrated that moving illusory contours \nactivate the primary visual cortex, our data suggest that this activation may reflect \nfeedback from the results of computations performed at higher stages of information \nprocessing. Indeed this conclusion, based on human neuropsychology, is complementary \nto lesion work with monkeys (Huxlin, et al. 2000) suggesting that the inferior temporal \ncortex (considered the monkey homologue to human LO) is required for the monkey\u201fs \nvisual system to generate illusory contours. We contend that this work highlights the \nvalue of neuropsychological research for teasing out the role of feed-forward and \nfeedback effects in the human visual system. \n \nReferences \nCarey, D.
