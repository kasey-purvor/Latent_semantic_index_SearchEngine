Troitskaya et al. (1971) realised that\nwhenever the cone angle of the IMF dropped below a certain\nthreshold enhanced ULF power was observed.\nTroitskaya et al. (1971) explained this observation by at-\ntributing the wave generation process to populations of back-\nstreaming ions at the bow shock which are most likely to\noccur during times of low cone angles. These backstreaming\nions resonantly interact with naturally occurring waves in the\nsolar wind, amplifying them. Since the propagation speed for\nULF waves in the solar wind is significantly lower than the\nsolar wind flow speed, these ULF waves are convected down-\nstream towards Earth. The compressional waves cross the\nbow shock, magnetosheath and magnetopause without sig-\nnificant changes to their spectrum (Krauss-Varban, 1994).\nWhereas the direction of the IMF controls whether waves\nare generated at the bow shock or not, the strength of the IMF\ncontrols the peak frequency at which waves are generated.\nTakahashi et al. (1984) used ATS 6 magnetic field data to find\nthat the peak frequency of waves observed inside the dayside\nmagnetosphere f was dependent on the IMF strength B and\nthe cone angle \u03b8xB .\nObservational evidence supporting this mechanism is\navailable in abundance. It has been studied in detail using\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n358 L. B. N.

The bottom panel shows\nthe IMF cone angle \u03b8xB .\nsatellites in the solar wind (e.g. Le and Russell, 1992a,b),\nin the dayside magnetosphere (e.g. Arthur and McPherron,\n1977) and ground based magnetometers (e.g. Webb and Orr,\n1976). Comprehensive reviews of the research done on up-\nstream generated waves and their interaction with the dayside\nmagnetosphere in the 1970s and 1980s can be found in Odera\n(1986) and Greenstadt et al. (1981).\nUsing magnetic field data from the ISEE 1 and 2 satel-\nlites the morphology of upstream waves within the solar wind\nmedium is well documented by Le and Russell (1992a) and\nLe and Russell (1992b). They found that the ULF foreshock,\ni.e. the boundary that separates the disturbed and undisturbed\nupstream magnetic field, begins at an angle of 50\u25e6 between\nthe IMF and the bow shock normal. The entire region con-\nnected to the bow shock with smaller angles is filled by\nwaves.\nDuring an inbound pass of the ISEE spacecraft, Le and\nRussell (1992b) observed waves up to 5RE upstream of the\nEarth bow shock. The upstream waves became stronger,\nmore compressional and more linearly polarised the closer\nthey were observed to the bow shock. They also found that\nthe spectral peak of the generated waves became broader the\ncloser they were observed at the bow shock whereas the peak\nfrequency stayed constant as long as the IMF strength did not\nchange. Directly behind the bow shock the peak spanned fre-\nquencies from about 10 to 100 mHz.\nOnce the upstream generated waves enter the dayside\nmagnetosphere they can mode convert to Alfve\u00b4nic waves\nwhere the frequency of the incoming compressional wave\nmatches one of the eigenfrequencies of a field line. The re-\nsulting Alfve\u00b4nic continuum has been observed by Engebret-\nson et al. (1986). As the upstream generation process for the\ncompressional waves is broad band compared to the spec-\ntrum of eigenfrequencies of field lines in the dayside magne-\ntosphere, a multi-harmonic Alfve\u00b4nic continuum is often ob-\nserved.\nChi and Russell (1998) used electric and magnetic field\ndata from the ISEE 1 spacecraft to determine energy prop-\nagation directions from the Poynting fluxes of waves in the\ndayside magnetosphere. They found that at higher frequen-\ncies (7\u2013100 mHz) only few waves are standing while most\nare travelling. They also found a tendency for waves to travel\nanti-sunward, clearly indicating an upstream source.\nOf the three possible regimes in which to study upstream\nwaves, i.e. upstream of the bow shock, in the dayside magne-\ntosphere and on the ground, all studies mentioned above only\nexamine one or two. Here we present simultaneous measure-\nments of upstream generated waves observed in all three re-\ngions.\n2 Observations\n2.1 Space based observations\n2.1.1 Geotail\nOn 5 September 2002 between 18:00 and 19:30 UT the Geo-\ntail satellite was located at (29, 7, 2)RE in GSM coordinates,\nabout 13RE upstream of the Earth\u2019s bow shock. The mag-\nnetic field instrument onboard the satellite sampled the IMF\nevery 3 s. The three IMF components Bx , By , Bz in GSM\ncoordinates and the magnitude Btot are shown in the top four\npanels in Fig. 1. The bottom panel shows the IMF cone angle\n\u03b8xB=acos(|Bx | \/Btot), i.e. the angle between the Sun-Earth\nline and the direction of the IMF.\nBefore 18:14 UT the cone angle of the IMF was around\n90\u25e6 due to small Bx values. At 18:14 UT Bx abruptly\nchanged to negative values around \u22125 nT causing the cone\nangle to drop below 40\u25e6. Between 18:14 and 18:24 UT the\ncone angle decreased further with two excursions to values\nabove 40\u25e6 at 18:17 and 18:22 UT.\nBetween 18:24 and 19:10 UT the cone angle was mainly\nbelow 30\u25e6 with brief excursions to slightly higher values at\n18:51 and 18:58 UT. From 18:30 to 18:48 UT it reached very\nlow values averaging around 10\u25e6.\nDuring this interval of very low cone angle pulsations\nin the magnetic field were observed, 13RE upstream the\nEarth\u2019s bow shock. The peak to peak amplitude was around\n0.5 nT in the X, 2 nT in the Y and 4 nT in the Z component.\nAt this time the field was essentially orientated in negative X\nAnn.

But as significant pulsation activity was\nalso observed in the field magnitude, compressional waves\nwere present, too.\nFigure 2 shows dynamic spectra of the three GSM compo-\nnents of the magnetic field measured by Geotail. The FFT\nlength was about 6.5 min (128 points) as indicated by the\nruler above the top panel in Fig. 2. The FFT window was\nadvanced by 32 points between successive spectra. Overplot-\nted on the spectral powers is the frequency f of the upstream\ngenerated waves as predicted by Takahashi et al. (1984):\nf = 7.6 Btot cos2 \u03b8xB . (1)\nHere Btot denote the IMF strength and \u03b8xB the cone angle. A\nmoving average of 20 points length (60 s) was used for Btot\nand \u03b8xB to eliminate short term fluctuations.\nAround 18:15 UT an increase in power at low frequencies\noccurred, most notably in the spectrum of the X component.\nHowever, this increase was not caused by pulsation activ-\nity but due to the step-like feature observed around that time\n(compare Fig. 1).\nA strong increase in FFT power between 30 and 70 mHz\nwas observed between 18:30 and 18:50 UT, a smaller in-\ncrease followed after 19:05 UT. The main increase of wave\npower was observed while the cone angle was particularly\nlow. The frequency at which most power was observed by\nGeotail was 40 mHz. This value is well matched by the fre-\nquency predicted by Takahashi et al. (1984) as shown by the\nblack solid line superimposed on the spectra. All four Clus-\nter satellites, as will be shown in the next section, observed\nthe most power in the compressional component at the same\nfrequency.\n2.1.2 Cluster\nOn 5 September 2002 the four Cluster spacecraft passed\nthrough the dayside magnetosphere. Their orbit and mag-\nnetic field lines as predicted by the Tsyganenko 96 (T96)\nmodel (Tsyganenko, 1995) are shown in the top two panels of\nFig. 3. Standard input parameters (Dst=0 nT, pdyn=2.0 nPa,\nBy=0 nT, Bz=0 nT) were used for the field line trace.\nThe orbit followed essentially the magnetic meridian at\n12:00 Magnetic Local Time (MLT) as the satellites passed\nfrom open field lines connected to the southern polar cap into\nregions of closed field lines. After having passed through\nperigee at a geocentric distance of \u223c4.5RE they then ex-\nited the closed dayside magnetosphere and entered open field\nlines connected to the northern polar cap.\nDuring autumn 2002 the average separation of the space-\ncraft was about 1RE . During the event discussed here it\nranged from\u223c0.5RE between s\/c 1 and 2 to 2.5RE between\ns\/c 1 and 3. At 15:00 UT s\/c 1 and 2 led the orbital motion,\nfollowed by s\/c 3 and 4. As s\/c 4 was on the orbit with the\nsmallest perigee it caught up with s\/c 1 and 2 by the time\nthese satellites reached the northern cusp region. s\/c 3 was\nFig. 2.

(1).\nlagging behind all other spacecraft throughout the entire in-\nterval.\nThe Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) onboard the Cluster\nsatellites provides the full 3-D magnetic field B at 4 s (spin)\nresolution. Additionally, the Electric Field and Waves (EFW)\ninstrument measured the electric field E in the spin plane of\nthe spacecraft.\nOn the timescales of ULF pulsations the frozen-in theorem\nis usually fulfilled. Hence we can assume B and E to be\nperpendicular. This assumption allows us to reconstruct a\n3-D electric field in GSM coordinates by using\n0 = E \u00b7 B \u21d4 Ez = \u2212\n(\nExBx + EyBy\n)\n\/Bz (2)\nEquation (2) will not produce sensible results whenever the\nmagnetic field vector is close to the spacecraft spin plane.\nElectric field values were therefore treated as missing data\nwhenever the angle between the magnetic field and the spin\nplane was smaller than 5\u25e6.\nAfter the full electric field has been computed, both field\ndata have then been transformed from GSM into a mean\nmagnetic field aligned coordinate system (MFA). The field\naligned direction F in this orthogonal system is calculated\nby a moving average over each GSM component of the mag-\nnetic field over 150 points (10 min).

The top two panels show the orbit of the Cluster satellites\nin GSM coordinates between 15:00 and 21:00 UT projected into\nthe XY and XZ plane. Every full hour the positions of all four\nspacecraft are shown, s\/c 1 is coloured black, s\/c 2 red, s\/c 3 green\nand s\/c 4 blue. The dotted lines indicate the magnetic field pre-\ndicted by the T96 model. The bottom panel shows the footprint\nof s\/c 3 over Northern America in magnetic coordinates between\n16:30 and 21:00 UT. Positions of magnetometer stations belonging\nto the CARISMA and MACCS chain are also shown. The statisti-\ncal location of the auroral oval (Feldstein and Starkov, 1967) for the\nprevailing geomagnetic conditions (Kp=1) is superimposed in light\ngrey for reference.\nof this component is parallel to the background magnetic\nfield. The vector product of the satellite\u2019s geocentric position\nr and the field aligned direction gives the azimuthal direc-\ntion as A=F\u00d7r . The azimuthal axis points eastward. The\nradial component R then completes this right handed coor-\ndinate system as R=F\u00d7A. The radial axis points radially\ninwards.\nSince the electric field was constructed under the assump-\ntion that it is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the field\naligned component of the electric field in the MFA system\nwill be identical zero. Hence only the azimuthal and the ra-\ndial component of the electric field are displayed in the fol-\nlowing discussions.\nThe advantage of the MFA coordinate system is that the\ncomponent in which an oscillation is observed will identify\nits wave mode. Compressional modes are observed in the\nfield aligned magnetic field. Oscillations in the azimuthal\nmagnetic and radial electric component are toroidal Alfve\u00b4nic\nmodes whereas poloidal Alfve\u00b4nic modes are observed in the\nradial magnetic and azimuthal electric field.\nAfter the data were transformed into the MFA coordinate\nsystem the magnitude of the T96 magnetic field model at the\nspacecraft\u2019s position was subtracted from the field aligned\ncomponent. Again, standard input parameters (Dst=0 nT,\npdyn=2.0 nPa, By=0 nT, Bz=0 nT) were used for the T96\nmodel.\nBoth magnetic and electric field data were then high pass\nfiltered with a cut-off period of 4000 s. Subsequently a dy-\nnamic FFT of length 128 points (\u223c8 min, denoted by the\nruler above the top panel in Figs. 4 to 7) was applied to the\nthree Hamming window tapered time series of each space-\ncraft. This FFT length results in a frequency resolution of\nabout 2 mHz. Each FFT window as advanced by 32 points\n(about 2 min). The results of the two electric and three mag-\nnetic components in the MFA system are shown for the four\nspacecraft in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7.\nThe thick dashed white lines plotted over the dynamic\nFFTs of the toroidal magnetic and electric field show the fre-\nquencies of the six lowest toroidal harmonics as predicted\nby theory. How these were calculated will be discussed in\nSect. 3.2.\nSolid white lines on the spectra of the azimuthal electric,\nradial and field-aligned magnetic component give the fre-\nquency of upstream generated waves as predicted by Eq. (1).\nThe bottom panels in Figs. 4 to 7 give L-value L of the\nspacecraft determined from the magnetic latitude \u03bb and the\ngeocentric distance r as L=r\/acos2(\u03bb). The time of reach-\ning the minimum L-value during the orbit is marked in all\npanels, the minimum L-value and the time are also given in\nthe bottom panels.\nThe Open Closed Field Line Boundary (OCB) for all\nspacecraft was determined from electron energy distribu-\ntion measurements by the PEACE instrument onboard the\nsatellites (not shown).

The criterion\nfor an in\/outbound boundary crossing was that the differ-\nential energy flux (DEF) at 5 keV rose\/dropped to values\nabove\/below 10\u22126 \u00b5J\/cm2 s sr eV. With this rather crude cri-\nterion the crossings could be determined to an accuracy of\n\u00b12 min which is sufficient for this study.\nBefore having entered closed magnetic field lines the satel-\nlites flew through the cusp region of the magnetosphere. This\nregion is usually characterized by broadband ULF wave ac-\ntivity in magnetic field data (Dunlop et al., 2005). Hence a\nsharp decrease in wave power in the ULF band can also be\nused as a criterion for leaving the cusp and entering closed\nfield lines.\ns\/c 1 was the first satellite to enter closed field lines accord-\ning to electron DEF data at 15:36 UT. This time is marked by\na vertical dashed line in Fig. 4. The crossing was accom-\npanied by a sharp drop in the FFT power above 20 mHz in\nall three components of the magnetic field. The fact that the\nwave power dropped about 4 min later than the occurrence\nof a trapped electron population is due to the finite length\nof the FFT as indicated by the ruler above the top panel in\nFig. 4. The outbound OCB crossing with reversed charac-\nteristics, i.e. sudden increase of ULF broadband power and\ndisappearance of the trapped electron population, occurred\nat 19:57 UT.\nThe inbound leg of the orbit between 15:36 and 17:49 UT\n(perigee) was characterised by very low wave activity be-\ntween 0 and 80 mHz. In the radial and azimuthal magnetic\ncomponent two lines of increased power at a constant and a\nslightly increasing frequency were observed. These are in-\nstrumental artifacts and have no physical relevance in this\ncontext.\nHorizontal lines of increased power at 20, 40 60, and\n80 mHz were also observed in both electric field components\nby s\/c 1. These too are instrumental artifacts.\nAt 18:10 UT, shortly after perigee, a simultaneous increase\nin wave power in the two electric and three magnetic compo-\nnents was observed. The increase is best seen in the compres-\nsional magnetic component (last spectrum in Figs. 4 to 7).\nThe power was structured in a fan-like fashion in the toroidal\nmagnetic component and, though somewhat less obvious, in\nthe toroidal electric component. The frequency decreased as\nthe L-value increased.\nWave power was also observed in the poloidal and com-\npressional components, however it was unstructured and\nbroad band. Its frequency did not seem to be dependent on\nthe L value.\nAs can be seen from the data presented in Figs. 4 to 7 the\nsudden increase in structured and unstructured ULF power\nwas observed by all four spacecraft simultaneously, although\nbeing located at different L-values within the dayside mag-\nnetosphere.\nFor all four spacecraft it is true to say that after having\nentered closed magnetic field lines, the FFT power was at\nvery low values for all three components. FFT power then\nincreased at 18:10 UT between 20 and 80 mHz in all com-\nponents at all spacecraft. Whereas it was broad band and\nL-value independent in the poloidal component, it was nar-\nrow band and L-value dependent in the toroidal component.\nThe compressional component showed also broad band, L-\nvalue independent power which abruptly decreased around\n19:10 UT. The decrease in less sharp in the other compo-\nnents.\n2.2 Ground magnetometer observations\nDuring the event stations belonging to the CARISMA and\nMACCS array of ground based magnetometers were located\nat the footprint of the Cluster satellites on the dayside of the\nmagnetosphere around 12:00 MLT. The footprint of s\/c 3 and\nthe positions of the magnetometer stations are shown in geo-\nmagnetic coordinates in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. The other\nspacecraft\u2019s footprints followed the trace of s\/c 3 very closely\nand are not shown for the sake of clarity. The statistical loca-\ntion of the auroral oval (Feldstein and Starkov, 1967) for the\nprevailing geomagnetic conditions (Kp=1) is superimposed\nin light grey for reference.\nDynamic spectra were calculated from available data of\nground based magnetometers. Before a FFT of about five\nminutes length was applied the otherwise unfiltered data\nwere reduced by a linear trend and multiplied by a 10% co-\nsine taper. Each FFT window was advanced by 32 points\n(two and a half minutes). The logarithm of the FFT power\nof the X component (geographic North-South) is shown in\nFig. 8.\nBetween \u223c18:20 and \u223c19:20 UT an increase in wave\npower at frequencies between 20 and 80 mHz was observed\nat all stations except CRV. This is in the same frequency\nrange as power was observed at the Cluster spacecraft and\nthe Geotail satellite. The observed power varied with latitude\nwhereas the peak frequency where most power was observed\nwas constant around 40 mHz. The qualitative agreement be-\ntween this frequency and the frequency predicted by Eq. (1)\nis, as before for Geotail and Cluster observations, very good.\nThe onset time was more distinct than the end time. After\n\u223c19:30 UT another increase in wave power at lower frequen-\ncies was observed.\nThe dynamic spectrum for data recorded at CRV shows\nno signatures of an increase in wave power between 20 and\n80 mHz. This is most likely due to the fact that CRV was\nlocated on open field lines. The poleward boundary of the\nauroral oval as indicated in Fig. 3 can be taken as a proxy\nfor the OCB and hence CRV was located on open field lines.\nAdditionally, s\/c 3 crossed the OCB around 16:45 (compare\nvertical dashed line in Fig. 6). According to the footprint\npredictions using the T96 model, this position matches well\nwith the location of the poleward boundary of the auroral\noval.\nAnn.

Also shown as a solid black line is the predicted frequency\nof the upstream generated waves as given by Eq. (1).\nThe fact that CRV did not observe any increase in wave\npower on open field lines strengthens our argument that up-\nstream generated waves entered the closed dayside magneto-\nsphere.\n3 Discussion\nAs outlined in the introduction, the connection between the\nIMF cone angle and pulsation power in the ULF frequency\nrange in the dayside magnetosphere is theoretically well un-\nderstood (Troitskaya et al., 1971). During times of low IMF\ncone angle solar wind ions are reflected at the bow shock.\nThese backstreaming ions generate waves in the solar wind\nby a cyclotron resonant interaction. Since the wave prop-\nagation speed is lower than the solar wind speed they are\nconvected with the bulk solar wind flow towards Earth, pass-\ning the bow shock and magnetopause without significant\nchanges to their spectrum. From the dispersion relation of\nMHD waves it is obvious that only the compressional waves\nwill enter the inner dayside magnetosphere.\nFrom Figs. 4 to 7 it is clear that the power in both the\npoloidal and compressional components of the magnetic and\nelectric was broad band whereas it was focused in bands in\nthe toroidal component. The clearest observations were pro-\nvided by data from s\/c 3 in Fig. 6.\nOur interpretation is that due to favourable conditions\nbroad band compressional waves were generated by back-\nstreaming ions upstream of the bow shock and entered the\ndayside magnetosphere. Here they mode convert into narrow\nband field guided Alfve\u00b4n waves, creating an Alfve\u00b4nic contin-\nuum.\n3.1 Field-aligned component\nThe sudden decrease in the IMF cone angle occurred at\n18:14 UT. Before 18:24 UT two brief excursions to larger\ncone angles occurred; the first 18:17 UT, the second at\n18:22 UT. To establish when compressional wave power was\nobserved by the Cluster spacecraft, a dynamic FFT with a\nlength of 32 points \u2013 a quarter of the length used to create\nFigs. 4 to 7 \u2013 was calculated. Subsequently all power be-\ntween 20 and 80 mHz was integrated to give a time series\nof the wave power. This time series is shown for the four\nsatellites in Fig. 9.\nFigure 9 shows that the compressional power in the mag-\nnetic field measured by the spacecraft arrived in wave pack-\nets rather than as continuous pulsations, as has been ob-\nserved before by Chi and Russell (1998). All packets have\nbeen marked with vertical dashed lines. These show that\nall packets were simultaneously observed by all spacecraft,\neven though their position within the dayside magnetosphere,\ni.e. their L-value, was significantly different (see top panel in\nFig. 9).\nThe amplitude of the wave packets seems to be controlled\nby a convolution of two factors. As the IMF cone angle\ndropped to values below 10\u25e6, the amplitude of the observed\nwave packets was higher. Secondly, the position within the\nmagnetosphere controlled the amplitude: the closer the satel-\nlite was to the equatorial plane the larger the observed ampli-\ntude.\nFigure 9 also reveals that the boundaries of the interval of\nenhanced power were controlled by time not by spacecraft\nposition. At the end of the interval after 19:05 UT s\/c 3 ob-\nserved no compressional power at L-values between 4 and\n5. However, earlier between 18:30 and 19:00 UT all other\nspacecraft had observed power at these L-values.\nThe first significant compressional power to be registered\nby the Cluster magnetometers started at 18:24 UT, i.e. 10 min\nafter the drop in the IMF cone angle was observed by the\nGeotail satellite. The delay time between the change in cone\nangle and the occurrence of wave power is due to two fac-\ntors: (1) the propagation of the change in IMF with the solar\nwind from the Geotail position to the bow shock and (2) the\nAnn.

After lagging the data by an appropriate delay due\nto the propagation of the solar wind, vsw can be estimated to\nbe \u223c430 km\/s during the event discussed here. This allows\nus to estimate \u03c4sw to be 3 min.\nKhan and Cowley (1999) argued that the transition time\nof the solar wind through the magnetosheath \u03c4sh can be esti-\nmated by\n\u03c4sh = Dbs0 \u2212Dmp0\n\u03b1 vsw \u2212 vmp ln\n(\n\u03b1 vsw\nvmp\n)\n, (3)\nwhere vsw is the solar wind bulk plasma speed and Dbs0 and\nDmp0 denote the bow shock and magnetopause standoff dis-\ntances, respectively. vmp is the plasma bulk speed at the\nmagnetopause which Khan and Cowley (1999) argued to be\n20 km\/s. \u03b1 is the ratio of the flow speed just downstream and\njust upstream from the shock, i.e. vbs\/vsw. This ratio follows\nfrom the usual shock jump conditions as\n\u03b1 = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)M\n2 + 2\n(\u03b3 + 1)M2 (4)\nwhere M is the magnetosonic Mach number and \u03b3=5\/3.\nFollowing Shue et al. (1997) the position of the magne-\ntopause Dmp0 was 11.0RE , the geocentric bow shock dis-\ntance Dbs0 was 15.0RE according to results from Peredo\net al. (1995). As the solar wind speed is known to have been\n430 km\/s, the estimated transition time \u03c4sh of the compres-\nsional waves from just upstream the bow shock into the day-\nside magnetosphere is then about 9 min.\nAdding \u03c4sw to \u03c4sh we arrive at a total delay time of 12 min,\nwhich is in excellent agreement with the observed 10 min.\n3.2 Azimuthal component\nIn the preceding section we have shown that the compres-\nsional power observed by the Cluster satellites was gener-\nated by backstreaming ions. We will now show that the\ncompressional waves mode-converted into toroidal Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves, generating Alfve\u00b4nic continuum.\nAs the satellites move from large to a minimum L value\non their inbound pass, the fundamental eigenfrequency of the\ncrossed field lines increases. Once the perigee is passed, the\nfield line length increases and hence the fundamental eigen-\nfrequency decreases.\nAccording to Schulz (1996) the frequency \u03c9n of the nth\nharmonic of the toroidal mode on a dipolar field line with a\nFig. 9.

(9) \u03c1ps0 is the equatorial plasmaspheric mass density\ninside the plasmasphere at a geocentric reference distance of\nLpp0 in units of Earth radii. Accordingly, \u03c1ms0 is the equato-\nrial mass density at a reference point Lmp0 inside the magne-\ntosphere.\nThe equatorial magnetic field B0(L) can be assumed to\nbe dipolar and depending on a reference point. The perigee\nof s\/c 3 was chosen as the reference point (L0=4.45RE ,\nBr0=310 nT) such that the magnetic field along the L values\ncan be modelled as\nB0(L) = Br0\n(\nL0\nL\n)3\n. (10)\nFor calculations using the above model, the knowledge of\nthe position of the plasmapause is essential. Figure 10\nshows electron densities deduced from spectra provided by\nthe Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of\nElectron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) instrument. A\nmodel plasma frequency can be fitted to every spectrum ob-\nserved by the WHISPER experiment, hence allowing the de-\ntermination of the electron density (Trotignon et al., 2001).\nElectron densities provided by the WHISPER instrument\nare linked to a quality flag. This flag is set to a value be-\ntween 0 and 100 according to the confidence of fit of the\nmodel plasma frequency to the measured spectrum. Fig-\nure 10 shows only measurements where this flag was bigger\nthan 33.\nFrom Fig. 10 it is clear that none of the spacecraft entered\nthe plasmasphere. The plasmapause position was therefore\nset to L=4RE as it will not further affect the model calcula-\ntions. Analogous to the model magnetic field, the perigee of\ns\/c 3 was chosen as the magnetospheric reference point for\nthe number densities (Lmp0=4.45RE , nms0=25 cm\u22123).\nUsing Eq. (5) the frequencies of the lowest six harmon-\nics of the toroidal mode were determined for every L-value\nalong the orbit of the Cluster satellites for an exponent of\nm=2 (compare Denton et al., 2002). The average mass per\nparticle was chosen to be 1.15 amu in order to reproduce the\nbest agreement at perigee between the model and the obser-\nvations.\nThe frequency values are overplotted on the spectra of the\ntoroidal field components in Fig. 4 to 7 and show excellent\nagreement with the observations.\nNote that one can even make some general remarks about\nthe node structures of the harmonics from the spectra. The\nfundamental toroidal mode has a node in the magnetic field at\nthe magnetic equator. The spectrum of s\/c 3 shows this char-\nacteristic by a decrease in wave power close to the perigee\nof the orbit. The second harmonic has an antinode in the\nequatorial plane which is observed as increased wave power\naround perigee at s\/c 3. The node structure is far less obvious\nin the toroidal component of the electric field.\nThis node structure was not observed by the other space-\ncraft because they had already passed the equatorial plane by\nthe time the Alfve\u00b4nic continuum started.\nTo further support our observations, the fundamen-\ntal eigenfrequencies of the field lines half way between\nsome ground based magnetometer stations belonging to the\nCARISMA chain have been calculated. Only data from mag-\nnetometers aligned along essentially the same longitude can\nbe used for this method.\nThe cross-phase technique has been proven to be an excel-\nlent diagnostics tool to determine the fundamental eigenfre-\nquency of field lines from ground based magnetometer data\n(Waters et al., 1991). The fundamental eigenfrequency of a\nfield line half way between two magnetometer stations can be\ndetermined by finding the maximum value of the cross-phase\ncalculated from the two latitudinally separated stations. Here\nwe used data from the suitable station pairs to find the fun-\ndamental eigenfrequency. The results are given in Table 1.\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 357\u2013371, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/357\/2009\/\nL. B. N. Clausen et al.: Simultaneous measurements of upstream waves 369\nThe cross-phase technique does not depend on large-\namplitude FLR signatures in the analysed ground-based\nmagnetometer data. Rather, the phase relation between\nsmall-amplitude pulsations which are assumed to occur at the\nnatural eigenfrequency is used for the frequency estimation.\nAccording to the prediction in Fig. 3 the foot print of s\/c 3\nduring perigee was located very close to the field line half\nway between PINA and ISLL. Hence the frequency of the\nlowest harmonic measured by both instruments should be\nvery similar.\nAnd indeed, the fundamental eigenfrequency of that field\nline was about 13 mHz according to the cross-phase analysis\nbased on ground based data (see Table 1). According to mea-\nsurements of s\/c 3 and the predictions of our model calcula-\ntions, the fundamental eigenfrequency at perigee at 18:54 UT\nwas 15 mHz (see Fig. 6).\nThe ground based magnetometer data has been checked\nfor signatures of FLRs. These would be expected to be ob-\nserved since the Cluster measurements show the existence\nof Alfve\u00b4nic continuum on the field lines conjunct with the\nground based magnetometers. E.g. FLR signatures would be\nexpected to occur with a frequency of 13 mHz and a reso-\nnance latitude around that of PINA and ISLL. However, no\npulsations with FLR characteristics were found.\nThe pulsations belonging to the Alfve\u00b4nic continuum had a\nrather small amplitude when observed by the Cluster satel-\nlites. Ionospheric screening probably prevented these oscil-\nlations to be observed on the ground.\n3.3 Upstream waves at Geotail\nThe observations discussed earlier raise the question why\nGeotail did not observe upstream waves from the moment\nthe change in IMF direction hit the bow shock. According\nto earlier calculations the upstream wave generation started\n3 min after the sudden positive turning in the IMF Bx com-\nponent was measured by Geotail at 18:14 UT. However up-\nstream waves are only observed at the Geotail position from\n18:30 UT onwards, also ending significantly earlier (around\n18:48 UT) than when the compressional power stopped being\ndetected by Cluster (around 19:10 UT).\nThe above observations can be explained when looking at\nthe configuration of the Geotail position, the IMF and the\nbow shock.\nThe ions reflected from the bow shock will essentially\ntravel along the IMF field lines against the solar wind stream.\nHence upstream wave will only be observed by Geotail if a\nIMF field line stretched from the spacecraft\u2019s position to the\nbow shock. Moreover, at the foot point of that field line on\nthe bow shock boundary the condition for ion reflection must\nhave been fulfilled. Whenever the angle between the field\nline from Geotail to the bow shock surface and the normal\nof the bow shock at the foot point was below 30\u25e6 upstream\nwaves are expected at the Geotail position.\nFig. 11. Geometry for different IMF orientations at different times\non 5 September 2002. The blue dot on the left marks the position\nof the Geotail satellite, the black dots represent the points on the\nbow shock surface from which the normal was calculated. The two\naccording normals are yellow and red, the average normal is in blue.\nAlso shown is the bow shock surface in the respective plane, the\nposition vector of the cross point and Earth.\nAs the IMF changed with time, the foot point moved over\nthe bow shock surface or in fact may not have crossed the sur-\nface at all. Additionally the angle between the IMF and the\nnormal at the foot point changed. This condition only decides\nwhether upstream wave are observed at the Geotail satellite.\nThe cone angle \u03b8xB controls whether waves are generated at\nthe nose of the bow shock.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, the angle \u03b8nB between the\nIMF direction through Geotail\u2019s position x\u02c6IMF and the shock\nnormal n\u02c6 at the point where x\u02c6IMF crossed the bow shock sur-\nface was calculated.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/357\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 357\u2013371, 2009\n370 L. B. N. Clausen et al.: Simultaneous measurements of upstream waves\nFig. 12. The black trace shows the angle \u03b8nB between the IMF\nconnected to the Geotail position and the normal of the bow shock\nsurface at the crossing point of the two. The red trace shows the\nIMF cone angle \u03b8xB .\nPeredo et al. (1995) gives a quadratic form to describe the\nshape of the bow shock depending on the Alfve\u00b4nic Mach\nnumber. The point at which x\u02c6IMF crosses the bow shock\nis thus easily found. From other points on the bow shock\nsurface in the vicinity of the cross point the normal vector n\u02c6\nand hence the angle \u03b8nB can be determined. This method is\nschematically shown in Fig. 11 at different times.\nThe angle \u03b8nB is shown in Fig. 12 in black. Also shown\nin red is the cone angle \u03b8xB . From the black curve it is clear\nwhy upstream waves were only observed between 18:30 and\n18:48 UT and between 19:10 and 19:20 UT. Only during\nthose times was the IMF orientated in such a way that the\nions would travel against the solar wind stream in the direc-\ntion of Geotail. Thus waves could be generated further up-\nstream and subsequently observed by the instrument onboard\nGeotail.\n4 Conclusions\nOn 5 September 2002 an increase in the IMF Bx compo-\nnent caused a sudden decrease of the IMF cone angle be-\nlow 30\u25e6. After the change in the IMF had propagated to the\nbow shock, the generation of waves due to reflecting ions be-\ngan. At 13RE upstream the bow shock the Geotail satellite\nobserved these upstream generated waves with a peak fre-\nquency of 40 mHz.\n10 min after the change in the IMF cone angle the Cluster\nsatellites registered a sudden increase in compressional wave\npower with a peak frequency of 40 mHz in the dayside mag-\nnetosphere. We show that this delay is consistent with the\npropagation of the IMF from the Geotail position to the bow\nshock and the subsequent propagation of upstream generated\nTable 1.

The ob-\nserved frequency of the lowest harmonic observed by s\/c 3\nat perigee is consistent with calculations of the fundamental\neigenfrequency of the involved field line using ground based\ndata. However, no FLR signatures were found on the ground\nas would be expected from the existence of the Alfve\u00b4nic con-\ntinuum.\nThe dipole based, toroidal FLR solution of Schulz (1996)\nwas found to accurately predict the toroidal eigenfrequencies\nof the field lines crossed by the Cluster satellites. This is true\nfor both the magnetic and electric field. Due to the polar\norbit of the Cluster satellites, node structures of the Alfve\u00b4nic\ncontinuum were observed.\nThe magnetometer onboard Geotail registered wave activ-\nity significantly after the change in the IMF cone angle had\nreached the bow shock. We explain this observation by show-\ning that only during this later interval was the IMF orientated\nin such a way that reflected ions could propagated beyond the\nposition of Geotail.\nWe therefore present, for the first time to our knowledge,\nsimultaneous observations of upstream generated waves in\nthe solar wind, the dayside magnetosphere and on the\nground.\nAcknowledgements.
