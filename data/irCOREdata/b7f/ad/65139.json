This paper seeks to redress this \ndeficit by providing a description of the characteristics of Fair Trade, including definitional issues, \nmarket size and segmentation and the key organisations. It discusses Fair Trade from Southern \nproducer and Northern trader and consumer perspectives and highlights the key issues that currently \nface the Fair Trade movement. It then identifies an initial research agenda to be followed up in \nsubsequent papers. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Fair Trade movement can, in one sense, trace its origins back to the development of the co-\noperative movement in the late nineteenth century. In the form in which it is recognisable today, \nhowever, it began with the Mennonite Central Committee trading with poor communities in the \nSouth in the 1940s (IFAT, 2003) but only began to expand and become a \u201cmovement\u201d in the 1960s \nand 1970s. It has grown significantly since that time but still remains relatively small in trading \nterms. Despite this, it has attracted attention in the academic literature from a wide range of \ndisciplines including economics, marketing, design, agriculture, rural studies, development studies \nand theology. However, the exposure within the business and management literature in general and \nthe business ethics literature in particular has been limited. \n \nThis paper seeks to begin the redress this deficiency and proceeds as follows. The defining \ncharacteristics of Fair Trade are covered first followed by a brief summary of the foundational \nissues that emerge from this. A Southern producer perspective is then adopted to review the issues \nthat Fair Trade raises principally for producer organisations, and this is followed by an equivalent \nsection that adopts a Northern trader \/ consumer perspective. The issues that confront the Fair Trade \nmovement at present are addressed within these two sections and from this an initial research \nagenda is identified. \n \nDefining characteristics of Fair Trade \n \nDefinitions \n \nOver its history there have been many and varied definitions of Fair Trade. However, in an attempt \nto produce a widely accepted definition, FINE\n2 \nhas developed the following: \n \nFair Trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks \ngreater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering \nbetter trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers \n\u2013 especially in the South. Fair trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged \nactively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the \nrules and practice of conventional international trade.  (FINE, 2001) \n \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 3 \nThe goals of Fair Trade that flow from this definition are: \n \n1. To improve the livelihoods and well-being of producers by improving market access, \nstrengthening producer organisations, paying a better price and providing continuity in the \ntrading relationship. \n2. To promote development opportunities for disadvantaged producers, especially women and \nindigenous people, and to protect children from exploitation in the production process. \n3. To raise awareness among consumers of the negative effects on producers of international \ntrade so that they exercise their purchasing power positively. \n4. To set an example of partnership in trade through dialogue, transparency and respect. \n5. To campaign for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade. \n6. To protect human rights by promoting social justice, sound environmental practices and \neconomic security. \n(Redfern & Snedker, 2002, p.11) \n \nThis definition and set of goals indicate that Fair Trade has, in essence, two basic components or \nvisions. The first is to provide a working model of international trade that makes a difference to the \nproducers and consumers that engage in it. In this, Fair Trade exemplifies principles (for example, \nthe need to internalise externalities into pricing) and develops consumer consciousness. The second \nand more radical is to challenge orthodoxy in business practice and to do so not simply by \ncampaigning but by being a \u201ctool for modifying the dominant economic model\u201d (see Renard, 2003, \np.91).  \n \nMarket characteristics \n \nAttempting to quantify Fair Trade in terms of market size and market segmentation is problematic \nbecause of the lack of an overarching trade body (see below) and because its size and geographical \ndispersion is such as not to warrant the attention of market intelligence agencies. Nonetheless, some \napproximations that help to frame the size and shape of Fair Trade can be made. \n \nRedfern & Snedker (2002, p.22) gave an (undated but presumably contemporary) estimate of the \nFair Trade worldwide as US$500 million, although they claim that this is likely to be an \nunderestimate. EFTA\n3 \n(2001, p.14) estimated that the annual aggregate net retail value of Fair Trade \nproducts (labelled and non-labelled) sold in Europe through alternative channels and supermarkets \nexceeded 260 million euros (again, the date is not clear but can be assumed to be 2000). Assuming \nrough dollar \/ euro parity means that the market for Fair Trade in the rest of the world excluding \nEurope is about US$240 million. The Fair Trade Federation (2002) in North America estimated that \nthe gross sales by Fair Trade Federation companies, combined with sales of certified Fair Trade \ncoffee sold by conventional companies, neared US$100 million in the U.S. and Canada in 2000. \nHence, this would leave a market of approximately US$140 million in other developed countries \nsuch as Australia, New Zealand and Japan. This seems slightly optimistic for these particular \ncountries, but overall the figures seem to confirm the US$500 million as a reasonable estimate of \nthe market size throughout the world. By comparison, Tesco, the largest of the U.K. food retailers, \nhad a turnover in 2003 of \u00a328.6 billion or roughly US$45 billion. This is 90 times the worldwide \nturnover of Fair Trade. \n \nIn terms of market segmentation, one division that can be made is into labelled and non-labelled \ngoods (see below). FLO\n4\n estimates that 260 million euros of FairTrade labelled products were sold \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 4 \nto consumers in 17 countries in Europe, North America and Japan in 2002 (FLO, 2003). These are \nalmost entirely food products and suggests that the non-food products such as crafts, jewellery, \nclothes and textiles amount to roughly the same amount in value terms. The European Commission \n(1999) estimated that in the EU food products represented around 60% of retail turnover of which \napproximately 50% was from coffee sales. However, that seems to be an underestimate of the food \nsales, with EFTA (2001, p.14) estimating that of the 260 million euros approximately 210 million \neuros or 80% was food in 2000. In the U.S. and Canada, coffee sales represented 66% of total Fair \nTrade sales in 2000 (Fair Trade Federation, 2002). For comparative purposes, these figures \nrepresent between 0.1% (France) and 3.3% (Luxembourg) market shares in coffee (EFTA, 2001), \nalthough figures for Cafedirect indicate that it had obtained 7.2% of the U.K.\u201fs roast and ground \ncoffee (Mintel, 2001, cited in Nicholls, 2002, p.8). \n \nFair Trade products are sold through three main channels: dedicated retail outlets, supermarkets and \nmail order. In Europe there are approximately 2,700 \u201cworld shops\u201d \u2013 the name conventionally \nadopted by these dedicated retail outlets. Fair Trade products are also available in 43,000 \nsupermarkets throughout Europe. In the U.S. and Canada in 2001 there are at least 7,000 retail \noutlets for Fair Trade products (Fair Trade Federation, 2002). Mail order generally accounts for less \nthan 10% of an importing organisation\u201fs turnover, although on-line retailing facilities may affect \nthis channel in future. In addition to these three main channels there are other retail channels such \nas solidarity groups, wholefood shops, and independent commercial stores (EFTA, 2001).  \n \nIndustry structure \n \nThe organisations that make up the Fair Trade movement can be divided into four main groups. \nFirst, there are the producer organisations in developing or Southern countries which supply the \nproducts. Second, there are the buying organisations in developed or Northern countries which act \nas importers, wholesalers and retailers of the products purchased from the Southern producer \norganisations. These have, in the past, been known as Alternative Trading Organisations (ATOs) a \nname stemming from the early days of Fair Trade where \u201cfair\u201d seemed too weak a description of \nthe common vision that forged these companies into a movement. Further details of producer and \nbuyer organisations are given in other sections below. \n \nThird, there are the umbrella bodies which consist of the following six organisations. IFAT\n5\n was \nestablished in 1989 and is a worldwide membership organisation that brings together both \nproducers and buyers. It consists of approximately 110 producer organisations and 50 buying \norganisations, although its membership is expanding (IFAT, 2003). \n \nFLO was established in 1997 and is the worldwide Fair Trade standard setting and certification \norganisation. \u201cIt permits more than 800,000 producers and their dependents in more than 40 \ncountries to benefit from labelled Fairtrade. FLO guarantees that products sold anywhere in the \nworld with a Faitrade label \u2026 conform to Fairtrade Standards \u2026\u201d (FLO, 2003). FLO currently sets \nstandards for the following products: bananas, cocoa, coffee, fresh fruit, honey, juices, rice, sugar, \ntea and sports balls, with standards for more tropical fruit, wines and other tropical products under \ndevelopment. It also has two sets of generic producer standards, one for small farmers, which \napplies to smallholders organised in co-operatives or other organisations with a democratic, \nparticipative structure, and the other for workers in plantations and factories. FLO estimates (FLO, \n2003) that, as of June 2003, it is working with 315 certified producer organisations, representing \nalmost 500 first level producer structures, and around 900,000 families of farmers and workers, \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 5 \ncoming from over 40 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America; 249 registered traders, consisting \nof exporters, importers, processors and manufacturers, from over 61 countries; and 443 licensees, \nauthorised by FLO\u201fs member organisations (the National Initiatives which use labelling schemes \nsuch as FairTrade Mark in the U.K. and Ireland, Max Havelaar (7 European countries), Transfair (4 \ncountries including the U.S. and Canada), Reilun kauppa (Finland) and Rattvisemarkt (Sweden) \n(EFTA, 2001)). FLO has recently introduced a common label to be applied across all products in all \ncountries; something that has both clear packaging and marketing advantages. \n \nThe other four umbrella bodies are as follows. NEWS!\n6,\n established in 1994, acts as the umbrella \nbody for the \u201cworld shops\u201d that retail predominantly Fair Trade goods across Europe (EFTA, 2001, \np.10). EFTA, established in 1990, is an association of 12 importing organisations in 9 European \ncountries (ibid., p.10). Fair Trade Federation is an association of fair trade wholesalers, retailers and \nproducers with 84 members in 2000, covering the U.S. and Canada and promoting products which \nbear the TransFair label (see above under FLO). Finally, there is an organisation called Shared \nInterest which, while not a trade association organisation in the same way as the other umbrella \nbodies with the exception of FLO, provides trade finance to the Fair Trade movement largely via a \n\u201cClearing House\u201d promoted jointly with IFAT but also serving producers certified by FLO.  \n  \nFourth, there are a wide range of mostly conventional organisations, typically supermarkets, that \nengage in some way in Fair Trade. As indicated above, 43,000 supermarkets across Europe and a \nfurther 7,000 in the U.S. and Canada stock Fair Trade products. While in one sense these could \nrightly be regarded as being outside the Fair Trade movement, they are becoming increasingly \nimportant players in the retailing of Fair Trade products, and as Fair Trade becomes more \nmainstream, this trend is likely to increase. Many of the supermarkets sell products sourced from \nthe Fair Trade movement. However, a number are beginning to sell \u201cown brand\u201d Fair Trade \nproducts sourced directly from producers without involving the ATOs as middlemen. In the U.K. \nthe Co-operative supermarket group is in the forefront of this development. \n \nFoundational issues \n \nBefore going into further detail of Fair Trade by considering the perspectives from South and \nNorth, it is worthwhile at this point drawing out some of the foundational issues that arise from the \ndefining characteristics of Fair Trade outlined above. \n \nThe first point to note is the challenge to international or, more pertinently, \u201cfree\u201d trade that is \ninherent both in the name (\u201cFair Trade\u201d) and in the definition and goals of Fair Trade. The two \nvisions of Fair Trade (a working model and the challenge to orthodoxy) inevitably create an \nelement of tension, with Fair Trade operating simultaneously \u201cinside and outside\u201d (Renard, 2003, \np.92) or \u201cin and against\u201d (Raynolds, 2000, p.299) the market. This tension is felt not only within the \nFair Trade movement but more particularly outside it. Comparisons between fair and free trade are \nevident in the economics literature (see, for example, Leclair, 2002; Maseland & De Vaal, 2002), \nwhere Fair Trade is sometimes characterised as being a \u201cthird way\u201d between free trade on the one \nhand and protectionism on the other. Unfortunately, protectionism has also been termed \u201cfair trade\u201d \nwhere this refers to \u201ccalls for protectionist measures by developed countries against products that \nhave been produced in poorer countries at prices developed countries cannot compete with because \nof their different economic circumstances\u201d (Maseland and De Vaal, 2002, p.252). The demand is \nfor compliance with environmental and labour standards by developing countries and is motivated \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 6 \nby the desire to protect jobs at home. Defined in this way, most free traders \u201cview many fair traders \nas charlatans (protectionists masquerading as moralists)\u201d (Howse & Trebilcock, 1996, p.61). \n \nPositioning \u201cFair Trade\u201d, as defined by the Fair Trade movement, between free trade and \nprotectionism, the economics literature asks penetrating questions: What is a \u201cfair\u201d price for the \nexports of developing countries? Does paying a higher price make it fair? Would a straight \ndonation, rather than paying a higher price, be more efficient? Is Fair Trade always better than free \ntrade and protectionism or does it depend upon conditions? Is the reliance on the largesse of the \ndeveloped world sustainable through periods of economic uncertainty? Does the higher price lead to \nover-supply and delay a move to the development by producer organisations of higher added value \nproducts? Does it lead to dependency on the part of producers? Does it disadvantage those \nproducers which do not engage in Fair Trade compared with those which do? While generally \nLeclair (2002) and Maseland & De Vaal (2002) find in favour of Fair Trade in answer to these \nquestions, this is by no means unequivocally so; under certain conditions, it seems, both free trade \nand protectionism work better than Fair Trade, and direct donation is also claimed to be superior to \nFair Trade.  \n \nThere are related questions to do with scale. Does Fair Trade \u201ework\u201f because it is marginal in scale, \nsince the distortions it produces (e.g. overproduction) are minimal and the consumers opting to pay \nmore for the intangible benefits are generally making informed choices. Would either of these hold \nat a larger scale\n7\n? Both these and the questions above invite further work in this area. \n \nMaseland & De Vaal (2002) raise another issue \u2013 that of the moral basis of fair trade. \u201cThe moral \nobligation to act in this fair trade manner stems from an idea of justice that lies underneath the fair \ntrade concept. The conduct called fair trade, in other words, is an operationalisation of an idea of \nwhat just trade would be\u201d (ibid. p.253). They categorise fair trade arguments in terms of \u201carguments \nthat relate to certain conditions under which trade, and the production of traded goods, should \nminimally take place\u201d and secondly \u201carguments that deal with the consequences of trade\u201d (ibid. \np.254). Clearly, the concept of justice underlies many of the principles on which Fair Trade is \nestablished and the assertion of injustice in conventional international trade is never far from the \nsurface. In Boda\u201fs analysis of free and fair trade, and the ethical principles that underlie each, he \ndiscusses Nozickian concepts of procedural justice that underpin free trade, Rawlsian concepts of \ndistributional justice in relation to \u201cequitable\u201d trade, Fair Trade as an application of the ancient \nfairness principle \u201cto each his own\u201d, together with the challenge of intergenerational justice evoked \nby the concept of sustainable development (Boda, 2001). These papers provide a good starting point \nfrom which a fully worked-through theory of justice in relation to Fair Trade might be produced. \nFair Trade would also seem to be an ideal working model on which to test the practicalities of any \ntheoretical approach. \n \nRelated to this, a more general theory of Fair Trade again seems to be absent. Some work in the \ntheological area has been done (see, for example, Sugden, 1999 and Johnson & Sugden, 2001), and \nthe concepts of networks and partnership have been explored in the sociology and development \nliteratures (Raynolds, 2002 and Tallontire, 2000 respectively), but in general Fair Trade has \nremained a practical and campaigning response to the perceived and observed injustices of the \ncapitalist system. There is clearly work to be done in developing and articulating theoretical \nperspectives within which Fair Trade makes sense and while economic theory, moral philosophy, \ntheology, sociology and development studies have been identified, there may well be other \ndisciplines that could contribute to a broad-based theory of Fair Trade. \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 7 \n \nThree further preliminary issues can be identified. First, the difficulty of getting consistent data for \nFair Trade is a barrier to further analysis of trends. There is clearly a need, both for the Fair Trade \nmovement itself and for the research that could be undertaken into Fair Trade, for the establishment \nof a comprehensive database. Second, the definition of and associated standards for Fair Trade are \nof critical importance to the movement itself. This point is addressed further below. Third, as \nstandards for Fair Trade are further refined, the contrast with other \u201cethical\u201d trade becomes more \nstark. Again, this point is developed below. \n \n \nFair Trade from a Southern producer perspective \n \nThe characteristics of Fair Trade \n \nWhat does Fair Trade \u201efeel like\u201f from a Southern perspective? The essence of the Fair Trade \nrelationship is one of partnership (Tallontire, 2000) in which the \u201edeal\u201f as far as Southern producers \nis concerned offers: \n \n An emphasis on direct relationships between buyer and producer organisations \n The provision of some level of support against price fluctuations \n The payment of either a premium passed directly to the producer or a social premium to be \nused for the benefit of the community rather than individual producers \n The provision of pre-financing (often 50% or 60% of the final value of the order) to \nproducers as part of a stable, long-term business relationship \n Provision of information to producers on design, demand, rules and regulations, and prices. \n(Oxford Policy Management, 2000, p.10 with additions) \n \nThis is clearly an unusual business relationship, with producers as the primary stakeholders. It is \nalso a relationship which requires Southern producers to keep to their side of the bargain. Producers \nmust explicitly aim to provide safe and healthy working conditions and other social benefits to their \nworkers and are usually organised as producer-controlled co-operatives, NGOs or community \ngroups that are trading to support social and development programmes. In addition to social \nprovision, producers are expected to conduct their production and trade in such a way as to cause \nthe least possible environmental damage (IFAT, 2003). A further emphasis is on cultural identity in \nproduct development and market promotion where, particularly with craft goods, artisans are \nencouraged to draw on traditional materials, designs and skills. \n \nIn general, this more-than-business relationship seems to work well \u2013 although Tallontire (2000, \np.176) documents a problematic example between a coffee producer in Tanzania and Cafedirect in \nthe U.K. in which the producer seemed to hold a \u201cweak commitment to the developmental as \nopposed to market dimensions of the partnership\u201d. Littrell & Dickson (1998), however, provide \npositive examples of the appropriateness of the kind of work that artisan workers, in particular, \nengage in: the maintenance and development of traditional skills; the way in which work meshed \nwell with the daily life patterns of artisans; and the benefits of the additional income. The fact that \n\u201crequests for more work were consistently and strongly voiced\u201d and that, \u201c[l]arger FTOs [Fair \nTrade Organisations] receive requests for employment from new producer groups on a near-daily \nbasis\u201d (Littrell & Dickson, 1998, p.181) is evidence of the success of the basic business model and \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 8 \nwas echoed by delegates at the recent biennial IFAT conference\n8\n. Access to markets is clearly the \nkey element for Southern producers and the one that they value above all else\n9\n. \n \nThe \u201cfair\u201d price is, of course, also one of the other fundamental elements of Fair Trade and is one of \nthe reasons that producers are attracted to the Fair Trade model. Littrell & Dickson (1998, p.177) \ncite evidence that the financial return to artisan producers averages 40% of the retail price as \ncompared to 10% from mainstream retailers, although Traidcraft\u201fs 2002 accounts, for example, \nshow an equivalent figure of 23% (Traidcraft, 2002a). Raynolds (2002, pp.416-417) gives details of \nthe minimum coffee prices (for example, US$1.26 per pound for arabica coffee which includes a \nUS$0.05 social premium \u2013 about twice the world price) and comments that, \u201cFair Trade prices thus \nfollow market trends, but they are consistently higher and fairer. What most reflects alternative \nnorms of fairness is that these prices are guaranteed\u201d.  \n \nHowever, within the Fair Trade movement itself it is acknowledged that the definition of a fair price \nis problematic. Kocken (2002) notes that for many producer organisations the payment of a fair \nprice is less important than the long-term relationship, the advance payment and the certainty of the \nprice once fixed. She concludes that, \u201c[i]t might be better to give up the image of paying a fair \nprice, particularly for handicrafts. It would be closer to reality to say that Fair Trade pays the \nmaximum amount that is feasible on the market\u201d. \n \nHowever, as noted above, the advantageous price can have the disadvantage of producing \ndependency, whereas one of the goals of Fair Trade is to enable producers to \u201cbecome sustainable \nbusinesses in the local, regional and international marketplaces\u201d (Littrell & Dickson, 1998, p.181). \nAware of this issue, Traidcraft, for example, is developing a new policy: \u201cFor each partner or \nproducer organisation with whom we work, Traidcraft will develop and agree a clearer set of \ndevelopment objectives and timescales. Whilst looking for long-term relationships, we shall also \nplan for \u201cexit strategies\u201d that encourage our suppliers and partners to avoid becoming dependent \nupon Traidcraft\u201d (Traidcraft, 2002b, p.4). This point is reinforced by Kocken who, in commenting \non a number of Fair Trade impact studies, states, \u201c\u2026 many studies point out the need to gradually \nterminate current relationships with successful producer groups. This may offer opportunities for \nsupporting new groups. This would allow a greater number of producers to benefit from Fair Trade\u201d \n(Kocken, 2002). \n \nDependency, however, is probably less of a problem for producers of food products where there are \nother, mainstream outlets and the Fair Trade products are often in direct competition with branded \nproducts and so need to be of sufficient quality to compete. Hudson & Hudson (2003, p.3-4) cite \nevidence that in 1999 only 50% of the worldwide production of Fair Trade coffee was sold through \nFair Trade channels, the remaining 50% being sold on the regular market. Renard (2003, p.92) \nsimilarly cites the example of Mexican co-operatives approaching Carrefour and negotiating a 10 \nyear contract to sell their organic coffee directly and without the Max Havelaar Fair Trade label. \nThe issue of mainstreaming will be covered in more detail below, but the Fair Trade movement can \nclearly find itself in a dilemma with buying organisations criticising this kind of unilateral action on \nthe part of producers while at the same time recognising that they may have helped in creating an \nover-supply in the first place and recognising that part of the goal of Fair Trade is to encourage \nprecisely this ability on the part of producers to enter the mainstream. \n \nStandards and certification \n \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 9 \nStandard setting is a major industry in its own right within the Fair Trade movement. Essentially \nthere are two standard setting agencies: IFAT and FLO. IFAT has traditionally worked with craft \nproducers which have sold their product through the ATO channels. As such, the guarantee of a \nproduct being fairly traded was usually through the \u201cname\u201d of the ATO selling the goods. Thus, \nIFAT has only recently felt the need to introduce standards for its members. These standards, \napproved at the 2002 AGM, operate on a biennial self-assessment basis and cover: \n \n1. Creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged producers \n2. Transparency and accountability \n3. Capacity building \n4. Promoting Fair Trade \n5. Payment of a fair price \n6. Gender equity \n7. Working conditions \n8. Child labour \n9. The environment \n(IFAT, 2003) \n \nThe certification associated with these standards is the authorisation to carry the IFAT \n\u201cAccreditation Mark\u201d on the organisation\u201fs promotional literature. \n \nThe FLO standards operate in a quite different manner, acting mainly as a product (as opposed to \norganisation) standard. The basic standards, which apply almost exclusively to food products, were \ncovered above where both producer and product standards were discussed. The certification of \nthese standards is carried out by an autonomous unit within FLO which operates independently \nfrom any other Fair Trade interests and follows, as appropriate, the ISO 65 standards for \ncertification bodies. Because these products are traded through mainstream as well as ATO \nchannels, the need for a recognised trade mark became evident. However, unlike the \u201ctrust, respect \nand partnership\u201d (Raynolds, 2002, p.410) approach of non-food products, FLO standards can be \ncriticised for \u201cdestabilising notions of \u201etrust\u201f and \u201epartnership\u201d (ibid., p.418). While this may be the \ncase, clearly the mainstream market would be hardly accessible without such a guarantee \u2013 \nalthough, as Hudson and Hudson (2003, p.4) note, with such a \u201cproliferation of labels, from \n\u201cdolphin friendly\u201d to organic to GM free, it is scarcely surprising that consumers are a little \nsceptical about the informational legitimacy of a label stuck on a package\u201d. \n \nAn important point to note, however, about both IFAT and FLO standards is the involvement of \nSouthern producers in their development. While, according to Raynolds (2002, p.418), \u201cFLO \ncertification represents a form of control, linked to formal standards and inspections\u201d, she \nacknowledges that producer involvement mitigates this problematic aspect of standards and \ncertification. \n \nAs the quotation from Hudson and Hudson above notes, Fair Trade labels are in competition with \nmany others. From the Southern food producers\u201f perspective, the main alternative or \ncomplementary form of certification is organic. Organic certification, however, is extremely risky. \nIt may take three years to convert to organic status, during which time there may be reduced yields \nand no additional revenue. Certification costs are high, with producers often having to pay as much \nas 5% of their sales value, and since these products are then sold in highly volatile world markets \nand in competition with conventional products, the guarantee of a return from the investment is \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 10 \nlimited. Potentially higher prices than those offered by Fair Trade, however, mean that small coffee \nproducers, for example, limit their market exposure by dividing their sales between the Fair Trade \nmarket and the open organic market (Raynolds, 2000, p.302). However Raynolds also notes the \nmore fundamentally problematic aspect of organic standards. Despite their environmental \nadvantages, \u201c[a]t the level of the producer, one finds that marginal organic farmers in the South are \nlikely to be as dependent on exploitative middlemen, corporate buyers, and volatile prices as \nconventional producers, unless they enter fair trade networks\u201d (ibid., p.305) and she concludes that \n\u201c[f]rom both a theoretical and empirical perspective, the fair trade movement appears to be creating \na stronger alternative [than organic production] to our conventional corporate dominated world \nagro-food system\u201d (ibid., p.306).  \n \nMurray & Raynolds (2000) make similar points about organic food\u201fs detachment from social \njustice issues, and in their example of Chiquita\u201fs agreement with the largest Danish retailer FDB to \nsell Rainforest Alliance certified bananas, and the subsequent reduction of Fair Trade certified \nbananas from 8,000 to 400 boxes per week (ibid., p.71), they provide a dramatic illustration both of \nthe confusion in consumers\u201f minds and the potential impact upon Fair Trade products of alternative \n\u201cethical\u201d products.  \n \nEmpowerment \n \nTwo further points are worth making from the Southern perspective both related to the issue of \nempowerment. Empowerment has become a fundamental element of Fair Trade not only in its own \nright, but also as a means of enabling producers to deal directly with mainstream buyers. Oxford \nPolicy Management (2000, p.11) speaks of Fair Trade organisations as \u201cagents of empowerment\u201d, \nwhile Redfern & Snedker (2002, p.23) note the different ways in which this is approached, from \nproducers owning the means of production at one end of the spectrum through to producers having \nsome degree of representation but not necessarily control, at the other. An unusual example is that \nof the Kuapa Kokoo company in Ghana and Day Chocolate Company in the U.K. where Kuapa \nKokoo provided 33% of the equity in Day Chocolate and receives 66% of the profits (Redfern & \nSnedker 2002, p.24 and see also Tiffin, 2002). This kind of arrangement, however, can give rise to \nits own kinds of difficulty. With a \u201ecaptive\u201f market, producers can feel loyalty ties which undermine \nthe free market that otherwise operates within Fair Trade. Paradoxically, such ownership can dis-\nempower. \n \nA more critical note is struck by John (2001) with reference to labour standards. He makes the \ndistinction between standards and rights and is concerned at the exogenous determination of \nstandards from outside of the developing countries to which they are then applied \u2013 sometimes with \nthe threat of trade sanctions to enforce them. A labour-rights perspective, he contends, would be \nendogenous to the developing country and a programme to enable them would necessarily originate \nin the country of origin. This is a powerful reminder of the dangers of Northern organisations seeing \nthemselves as \u201cagents of empowerment\u201d but being too preoccupied with their own agendas to \nrecognise that empowerment is, by definition, not something that can be imposed. Tallontire\u201fs \nidentification of four periods of development in the ATO partnership model - goodwill selling (mid-\n1950s to early 1970s); solidarity trade (1970s to late 1980s); mutually beneficial trade (1990s); and \ntrading partnerships (1990s and the emerging trend) (Tallontire, 2000, pp.167-169) - perhaps \nindicates that this is becoming better understood within Northern Fair Trade organisations. \n \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 11 \nOther issues \n \nFrom a Southern perspective, perhaps the other key issue, is the impact of Fair Trade. Impact \nstudies were mentioned only briefly above and the evidence of the desire to participate in Fair \nTrade would seem to offer a definitive answer to any questions concerning the benefits. However, it \nis clear that the impact of Fair Trade, and the methodologies that are employed to assess it, are \nimportant.  The importance is not just to the producers themselves but also to the Northern ATOs in \nassessing their strategies, particularly in relation to mature producers, and to Northern markets in \nterms of the credibility of the \u201cinformational\u201d element in the Fair Trade offering. An important \naspect within impact studies is monitoring the degree of empowerment of the producer \norganisations. \n \nFair Trade from a Northern trader and consumer perspective \n \nMarketing and strategy \n \nA cursory glance at Fair Trade from an experienced business person who knew little about it, might \nlead that person to question how it manages to exist at all. Products that, certainly in the past if no \nlonger, were sub-standard compared with others on the market, marketed in a rather amateurish \nmanner and priced above comparable products, would not look to be a sound business proposition. \nThe fact that worldwide sales are now around US$500 million suggests that something rather longer \nthan a glance is required. However, the fact that, after 40 years of concerted activity, sales are not \nUS$5 billion (even then, only 11% of Tesco\u201fs 2003 turnover) might also require some explanation \n(see Watson, 2001). \n \nA starting point is to consider the type of consumers that might purchase Fair Trade goods. Bird & \nHughes (1997), drawing on Mintel reports published in 1994, divide consumers into three main \ngroups: ethical consumers (23%); semi-ethical (56%); and selfish (17%). In the four years since the \nprevious Mintel study on ethical consumerism in 1990 both the ethical and semi-ethical groups had \nincreased at the expense of the selfish group. Of the 23% in the ethical group 5% \u201calways \/ nearly \nalways buy \/ use\u201d ethical products while 18% \u201ctry as far as possible to buy \/ use\u201d them. Some \nconsumers were prepared to pay a premium (of between 10% and 18%) and those most willing to \npay were women, those in socio-economic classifications ABC1, and those under 35 years old. As \nthe authors comment, \u201c[t]hese groups form the prime targets for \u201cfair trade\u201d products\u201d (Bird and \nHughes, 1997, p.160). \n \nIn up-dating this study, Nicholls, drawing on a range of surveys, notes that, \u201cEthically sensitive \nconsumers are no longer a small, if vocal, pressure group: rather, a third of the public now see \nthemselves as \u201cstrongly ethical\u201d (Co-op, 2000). Furthermore, the main ethical issue of the 1980s \u2013 \n\u201cgreen\u201d environmentalism \u2013 has now been broadened from a product focus into a more general \nconcern over the entire production process, particularly highlighting the human \/ social element\u201d \n(Nicholls, 2002, p.9). \n \nBoth of these are U.K.-based studies, but the extrapolation of these broad trends to Europe is \nstraightforward. The report by EFTA (2001) entitled \u201cFair Trade in Europe\u201d covers 18 countries \nincluding the U.K. and catalogues a vibrant Fair Trade market in each of these countries. Murray & \nRaynolds (2000, p.67) make the observation that, generally speaking, Europe leads on \u201cethical \nconsumption\u201d, whereas in the U.S. environmental interests are more prominent; but there is clearly \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 12 \na Fair Trade market in the U.S. & Canada, as the US$100 million estimate from the Fair Trade \nFederation (2002), cited above, demonstrates. The existence of Fair Trade organisations in \nAustralia, New Zealand and Japan further illustrates that consumers, prepared to pay higher prices \nfor products that meet \u201cethical\u201d criteria, are present in most developed countries. \n \nWhat, then, is it about these products that meet the requirements of these consumers? Apart from \nthe basic utility of the product itself \u2013 be it a jute angel, silver earrings, ground coffee or a bottle of \nwine \u2013 the consistent message is that it is the \u201cethnic\u201d and associated \u201cinformational\u201d elements in \nthe product that provide the differentiating factor. Littrell & Dickson, from a U.S. perspective and \nwith largely craft products in mind, comment, \u201cFTO emphasis on high quality, ethnic products that \ncan be worn or used on a daily basis and that exhibit handmade qualities provides a competitive \nstrategy of \u201cdifferentiation\u201d that fits consumers\u201f motivations and demands \u2026\u201d (Littrell & Dickson, \n1998, p.183). Associated with this is the information often provided with the product that helps \n\u201ccustomers cross a philosophical bridge where meaning is attached to something someone has \nmade\u201d (ibid., p.184). This information is often in the form of stories about the individuals who \nmake or grow the product or about their communities and the benefits of Fair Trade in particular or \ncommunity development in general.  \n \nIn commenting on food products, Raynolds notes that, \u201c[i]f alternative products enter existing \nmarket circuits, their environmental and social qualities become subordinated to their price, as \noccurs with other commodities. Friedmann (1993) suggests that the way to counter this market \ndiscipline is to reduce the huge social distance that exists between producers and consumers\u201d \n(Raynolds, 2000, p.299). She reinforces this point by arguing that \u201ctheoretically it is in the process \nof capitalist exchange that commodities become abstracted from their human and natural roots, so \nthat price becomes their dominant characteristic\u201d and hence contends that Fair Trade initiatives \n\u201chave begun to create new networks of exchange that escape the bonds of simple price competition\u201d \n(ibid. p.306). This concept  - of networks reducing social distance - is discussed further in \nRaynolds\u201f subsequent article in which she investigates \u201chow the huge social and spatial distances \nbetween Northern consumers and Southern producers might be \u201eshortened\u201f within Fair Trade \nnetworks\u201d (Raynolds, 2002, p.404). \n \nFrom a marketing perspective it is therefore important to transmit to consumers what Strong (1997, \np.36) described as the \u201ccommunication of the human element of sustainability\u201d. Nicholls (2002, \np.13), in operationalising Strong\u201fs framework, suggests that brand building and information \ndissemination are required in order to achieve this. However, as Nicholls notes, \u201c[t]here is currently \nlittle or no coherence across fair trade brands in the U.K.. The only consistent feature on several \u2013 \nbut not all \u2013 products is the FairTrade Foundation certification mark. However, this has limited \npublic recognition and is never the prominent brand statement on any of these lines. Therefore, one \nstrategic approach to increasing the fair trade market share is to develop some strong brands within \nit.\u201d (ibid., p.14). (This approach would be in contrast to that in The Netherlands where the \ncertification mark is being seen as the brand, with individual companies acting almost as \nfranchisees\n10\n.) The issue of branding will be dealt with further below under mainstreaming. For \nnow it is worth emphasising, as mentioned above, that the branding of traditional craft goods in the \nU.K. at least, has occurred through the \u201cname\u201d of the ATOs (e.g. Traidcraft or Tearcraft) which has \nprovided the guarantee of quality and authenticity. \n \nFrom a Northern perspective, then, the way in which the ethical and semi-ethical consumer markets \ndevelop, their size, level of sophistication and desire for reliable product and producer information, \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 13 \nand their interest in (and ability to distinguish between) different \u201cethical\u201d products, perhaps \nthrough branding, is clearly key to the way Fair Trade develops. This is particularly so in relation to \nmainstreaming where unsophisticated consumers could easily be \u201cwon over\u201d to products that fail to \nmeet Fair Trade criteria. \n \nBefore considering the issue of mainstreaming, however, it is worth noting other approaches that \nhave been adopted from a business perspective to an analysis of Fair Trade. Littrell & Dickson\u201fs \nwork has already been cited above, but in their 1999 book they consider five scholarly perspectives \nfrom various academic fields that \u201cprovided a lens through which to consider the work of fair trade \nartisans, retailers and consumers\u201d (Littrell & Dickson, 1999, p.29). The five were: business \norganisational culture; business strategy; small business performance; artisanal work and \ndevelopment; and cultural product meaning for consumers. Space here does not permit further \nconsideration of these (though each has been touched on or will be covered below in some form), \nbut it is clear that each has the potential to contribute to further research into Fair Trade. Finally, \none other approach that has been taken has been to consider the nature of ethical decision making in \nFair Trade companies (Davies & Crane, 2003). \n \nMainstreaming \n \nOne business strategy that has been actively pursued by the Fair Trade movement has been the \nmainstreaming of Fair Trade. This has been mentioned several times above in the context of other \ndiscussions, but deserves consideration in its own right. The history of Fair Trade indicates a \nmovement that developed a close-knit set of producer-buyer relationships within a common \nframework of commercial practices, with emphasis on the producer as the key stakeholder. Starting \nfrom a product base largely in crafts, and with ATOs that found (and to some extent created) a \nmarket amongst a small group of ethical consumers, it was possible that Fair Trade would have \nremained a small, focused and \u201cpure\u201d commercial experiment. However, both its own vision of \nproviding a critique of conventional international trade and a practical example of an alternative \nway of trading, and the introduction of food products that held out the possibility of entering \nmainstream markets, led to Fair Trade moving more into the mainstream. Associated with this \nmove into the mainstream, of course, was the need to provide a consumer guarantee \u2013 hence the \ndevelopment of Fair Trade labels and, eventually, the establishment, in Europe for example, of \nFLO. \n \nThe potential for Fair Trade products in the mainstream is clear. Murray & Raynolds (2000, p.68) \ncite a European Community study that estimated that in 1997 the annual European market for Fair \nTrade bananas was 300,000 \u2013 400,000 tonnes, roughly 25 times the actual volume of Fair Trade \nbananas at that time. Cafedirect, as noted above, had obtained 7.2% of the U.K.\u201fs roast and ground \ncoffee market, and plans to attain 10% in this segment and 4% of the freeze dried market \n(Cafedirect, 2003). Other success stories in the U.K. include Traidcraft\u201fs Geobar and the Co-\noperative supermarket\u201fs decision to back Fair Trade with an anticipated turnover of \u00a310 million in \n2003\n11\n. This compares with Traidcraft, the biggest U.K. ATO, where the 2002\/03 turnover was \u00a312 \nmillion \u2013 an indication of how quickly the mainstream could take over as the main channel through \nwhich Fair Trade products are sold. \n \nSuccess in entering the mainstream, however, carries with it the risk of dilution. The Co-operative \nsupermarket indicated that 9 of its best 10 Fair Trade lines in 2002 were own-brand products\n12\n, and \nwhile the authenticity of their products is not in doubt, it is not difficult to envisage a situation in \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 14 \nwhich the mainstream seeks to co-opt Fair Trade to its own ends. Indeed, the concern has already \nbeen raised, with Renard, for example, citing an instance from Belgium involving Oxfam and one \nof the country\u201fs largest supermarkets in which the offer to sell Fair Trade products raised \u201cthe \npossibility of distributing products from the South on a large scale, thus benefiting more producers, \nbut in exchange for granting these not-always-ethical corporations opportunities to engage in \n\u201cimage-laundering\u201d\u201d (Renard, 2003, p.93). Renard, similarly, cites the example of the benefit to \nStarbucks\u201fs image (under the threat of a campaign by ethical trade activists) of carrying one fairly \ntraded coffee in its range. Taking Fair Trade at face value and benefiting by association is one thing \nthat Fair Trade has had to become accustomed to from mainstream organisations.  \n \nOne other risk is that \u201cthe space that exists for alternative trade will be subverted by profit seeking \ncorporations\u201d as they try \u201cto bolster their legitimacy by adopting the rhetoric of environmental \nand\/or social responsibility\u201d (Raynolds, 2000, p.299). This presents Fair Trade with a dilemma \ninvolving \u201cthe dilution of fair trade ideology by the market\u201d in which the organisations find \nthemselves either remaining \u201cpure\u201d but probably marginal, or aligning with the mainstream and \n\u201closing their soul\u201d (Renard, 2003, p.92 and citing Regnier (2001)). Murray and Raynolds (2000, \np.72) speak of \u201ctransnational corporations \u2026 constantly seeking to capture these initiatives and \nredefine them in ways that advance not progressive agendas, but their own private profits\u201d. This is a \nmore serious risk because the Fair Trade movement stands to lose by being \u201csubverted\u201d, \u201cdiluted\u201d \nor \u201credefined\u201d in such a way that the original message and purpose is lost. \n \nPerhaps lower risk, because it is easier to counter, are direct attacks by the mainstream against the \nconcept of fairness in trade. Tiffin (2002, p.390) cites the example of Nestle and Cadbury taking \nvery firm public positions in claiming that, for example, \u201cNestle cocoa is fairly traded\u201d and \u201cYorkie \nand all our other chocolate products are produced fairly\u201d.  \n \nHow does Fair Trade seek to minimise these risks while, at the same time, maximising the amount \nof trade that is conducted on a Fair Trade basis, to the benefit of Southern producers? As noted \nabove, branding, and the associated issues of standards, certification and labelling are key to \npreserving the uniqueness of Fair Trade, and Nicholls\u201f (2002) critique of current branding, noted \nabove, is pertinent here. An element of branding is, of course, to protect the brand from abuse by \nothers and this will require the marketing and campaigning elements of Fair Trade in combination. \nAssociated with this is the need to maintain and improve the informational element in Fair Trade \nproducts that provides the differentiating factor. In addition to direct marketing communications \nrelated to products, Nicholls highlights the need for \u201c[b]road initiatives to increase consumer \nawareness and understanding of fair trade\u201d and the use of tactics to \u201chighlight other added benefits \nin fair trade products, such as the high quality of Cafedirect coffee, the low-fat profile of \nTraidcraft\u201fs Geobar, the organic\/health aspect of Ridgway\u201fs tea, or the environmental credentials of \nfair trade bananas\u201d (Nicholls, 2002, p.15). \n \nDespite these protective mechanisms, the \u201creabsorption [of Fair Trade] by the market is not idle \nspeculation but rather is sustained by the growing interest of certain sectors of food production and \ndistribution in fair trade\u201d (Renard, 2003, p.93). Perhaps the main threat is from own label products. \nRenard notes that \u201c[i]n spite of their campaigns, the heads of European ATOs are aware that if the \ncoffee roaster giants deployed all of their economic weight to promote their own label, they would \nwin over the consumers\u201d (ibid., p.93). \n \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004. Please do note quote without author\u2019s permission. \n \n 15 \nWithin Northern ATOs, all of these issues will play out in relation to their business strategies, \norganisational cultures, marketing and campaigning. This places a demanding agenda on mostly \nsmall, under-capitalised organisations with limited funding to promote their products and the \nmessage that goes with them. Their ability to manage their way through the tests that the next few \nyears will bring will largely determine the extent to which Fair Trade flourishes. \n \nAssociated with this, there is an issue for the Fair Trade movement in its entirety. The ability to \n\u201estick together\u201f, to work to clear definitions and standards, agree and implement a strategy on \nmainstreaming while maintaining the purity of the concept, and its ability to campaign effectively to \nminimise the potential subversion, dilution or redefinition will also be key to the flourishing of Fair \nTrade. \n \nAn initial research agenda \n \nRecognising the work that has already been conducted in the business and business ethics fields \n(Bird & Hughes, 1997; Strong, 1997; Littrell & Dickson, 1998, 1999; Nicholls, 2002; Davies & \nCrane, 2003) but drawing on the issues that have been identified above, the following research \nagenda can be identified\n13\n.  \n \n The mainstreaming of Fair Trade, and the associated issues of labelling and branding would \nbe a clear priority as a discrete research project. This would potentially be of benefit to both \nFair Trade and mainstream organisations and would also require that certain of the data \nrequirements would, at least, be identified in more depth. This project could initially be \nconducted on a national basis with a comparative study at a subsequent date. \n A related research project would be to look in more depth at the definitional aspects, \nstandard setting and certification of Fair Trade and would usefully make comparisons with \nother \u201cethical\u201d products, particularly organic. \n A further related research project would be to conduct further work on the consumer aspects \nof Fair Trade, the trends in ethical consumerism, the requirements of the \u201cinformational \nelement\u201d, pricing, marketing and branding. \n An investigation into pricing within the Fair Trade movement would be useful from two \nperspectives. From a practical perspective the question of how prices are set and what costs \nboth are and should be taken into account (capital and land values, wage levels, the costs of \nenvironmental standards, transportation, administration, marketing, and comparisons of Fair \nTrade levels of efficiency with the mainstream, for example) would be valuable. From a \ntheoretical perspective, this kind of analysis might inform philosophical considerations of \njustice within Fair Trade. \n Following from this, the impact of Fair Trade on the Southern producers and countries \nwhich are its raison d\u2019etre, including an in-depth review of the current methodologies for \nsuch studies, should lead to a greater understanding of the benefits of Fair Trade and would \nlink with the way in which these are valued by consumers. \n Many of the above are empirical studies that would lead to a greater understanding of Fair \nTrade and allow greater clarification of whether the benefits it claims and the associated \ncritique of conventional international trade are justified. To some extent these might answer \nor confirm the critique of Fair Trade levelled by the economics literature surveyed earlier. \nHowever, while empirical studies are clearly important, these need to be accompanied by \nassociated conceptual and theoretical work, as identified earlier in the paper. These would \ninclude work in economics but would also need to explore a fully worked-through theory of \nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004.

It is to that \nagenda that future papers will be addressed.\nAccepted for publication in Journal of Business Ethics, 2004.
