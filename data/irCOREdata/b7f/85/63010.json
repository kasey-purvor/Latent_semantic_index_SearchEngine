However, whether and how complex food-webs \nrespond to selection remains largely unknown. We show in the field that antagonistic \nselection from predators and pathogens on prey body-size can be a primary driver of food-\nweb functioning. In Windermere (UK), pike (Esox lucius, the predator) selected against small \nperch (Perca fluviatilis, the prey), while a perch-specific pathogen selected against large \nperch. The strongest selective force drove perch trait change and ultimately determined the \nstructure of trophic interactions. Before 1976, the strength of pike-induced selection overrode \nthe strength of pathogen-induced selection and drove change to larger, faster growing perch. \nPredation-driven increase in the proportion of large, infection-vulnerable perch presumably \nfavored the pathogen since a peak in the predation pressure in 1976 coincided with pathogen \nexpansion and a massive perch kill. After 1976, the strength of pathogen-induced selection \noverrode the strength of predator-induced selection and drove a rapid change to smaller, more \nslowly growing perch. These changes made perch easier prey for pike and weaker competitors \nagainst juvenile pike, ultimately increasing juvenile pike survival and total pike numbers. \nTherefore, although predators and pathogens exploited the same prey in Windermere, they did \nnot operate competitively but synergistically by driving rapid prey trait change in opposite \ndirections. Our study empirically demonstrates that a consideration of the relative strengths \nand directions of multiple selective pressures is needed to fully understand community \nfunctioning in nature.  \n 3\n\\body 1 \n 2 \nIntroduction 3 \n 4 \nInteracting populations often show reciprocal phenotypic changes reflecting co-adaptations. 5 \nIn turn, co-adaptations alter the strength and even the nature of interactions (1-3). Therefore, 6 \ncommunity structure and functioning is driven by an interplay between demography and 7 \nphenotypic change (4-6). Recently, there has been considerable interest in how prey adaptive 8 \nresponses to predators can drive community dynamics (5-10). At the same time, it has been 9 \nshown that parasites and parasite-mediated trait changes can play a crucial role in food-web 10 \nstructuring (11, 12). However, despite the fact that organisms are often confronted with both 11 \npredators and parasites (13), there have been few attempts to understand how adaptive 12 \nresponse to joint predation and parasitism affects food-web functioning in nature. Here, we 13 \nuse 50-years long time series from a whole-lake system (Windermere, UK) to show that 14 \nsimultaneous selection from both predators and pathogens structured the food-web in a way 15 \nthat could not be predicted by considering each selective pressure separately. 16 \nWindermere is a glacial valley lake of the English Lake District, divided by shallows 17 \ninto north and south basins of different size and productivity (14, 15). The fish community of 18 \nWindermere is size-structured, with only a few numerically dominant species interacting in a 19 \nmixture of competition, predation, and cannibalism termed intraguild predation (IGP) (16, 20 \n17). Perch (Perca fluviatilis) are the most abundant fish and are preyed upon by pike (Esox 21 \nlucius), the top predator of the system. Small perch below 16 cm body length (~ age \u2264 2 22 \nyears) feed entirely on zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, while large perch (above 16 cm 23 \nbody length) feed on macroinvertebrates and on their own fry (18, 19). Small pike below 20 24 \ncm body length (~ age \u2264 1.5 years) have the same diet as large perch (i.e. macroinvertebrates 25 \n 4\nand small perch), while large pike feed exclusively on fish, mostly perch of 6-9 cm body 26 \nlength (20). Consequently, small perch are prey for pike in Windermere, but large perch are 27 \npotentially strong competitors with pike (especially with small pike).  28 \nA long-term monitoring program for Windermere perch and pike was initiated in the 29 \nearly 1940s. Since 1944, pike have been gillnetted during winter (14, 15, 21, 22). Perch have 30 \nbeen caught with traps set on their spawning grounds from the end of April to mid-June (23). 31 \nOn each lift of a trap, the whole catch or occasionally a random fraction of the catch has been 32 \nsexed, measured for total body length, and opercular bones have been removed for age 33 \ndetermination following a validated method (24). Bone density differs between summer and 34 \nwinter, producing narrow bands (\"checks\") that are deposited on the opercular bones during 35 \nthe slow winter growth period. These checks then serve as an annual mark and, thus, allow 36 \nthe aging of individual fish (24). Pike were aged following the same method (25). The 37 \nabundances of both perch and pike have been estimated annually for the 1944-1995 period, 38 \nseparately for each basin as well as for both small (i.e. age = 2) and large (i.e. age > 2) 39 \nindividuals (26) (Fig. 1A and 1B). Together with these biological data, surface water 40 \ntemperatures were recorded on a near daily basis and were here averaged for each year. 41 \nFinally, maximum phosphorus concentration between September\/October in year y and 42 \nFebruary in year y+1 was measured each year since 1945 in the north basin and since 1946 in 43 \nthe south basin, and was here used as a proxy for Windermere primary productivity in year 44 \ny+1.  45 \nIn 1976, a perch-specific pathogen severely impacted the perch population (Figs. 1A, 46 \n1C and 1D). Although the primary pathogenic agent remains unidentified, the disease is 47 \ncharacterized by epidermal lesions associated with a wide variety of fungal and bacterial 48 \ninfections (27). The pathogen preferentially infects large, maturing (90-100% prevalence) 49 \nperch over small, immature individuals (50-70% prevalence) and induced a 98 % mortality of 50 \n 5\nspawners during the 1976 reproductive period (27). By 1977, captured perch showed no 51 \nexternal sign of disease (27), but the numbers of large perch have remained low since 1976 52 \n(Fig. 1A). Both the age structure (Fig. 1C) and mean body length (Fig. 1D) of the 53 \nWindermere perch population remains severely truncated, suggesting that the pathogen is still 54 \npresent. Windermere perch were shifted by the pathogen from an iteroparous to an effectively 55 \nsemelparous population (Fig. 1C), setting the stage for increased investment into one single 56 \nreproductive bout (28). Increased reproductive investment in perch is likely to have reduced 57 \nsomatic growth rate owing to the trade-off between body growth and reproduction (29). 58 \nAdditionally, in immature perch, disease prevalence is much higher on fast-growers than on 59 \nslow-growers (27), indicating a trade-off between disease resistance and somatic growth (28). 60 \nBased on these observations, we predicted that pike (predator)-induced selection and 61 \npathogen-induced selection acted in opposite directions on perch body-size and somatic 62 \ngrowth rate. Before pathogen invasion, perch somatic growth rate should have reflected the 63 \neffect of increased predation due to an increase in the pike\/perch ratio (Fig. 2A). After 64 \npathogen invasion, perch growth should have reflected the combined action of the two 65 \nantagonistic selective forces (21). We have tested this prediction by estimating nonlinear 66 \nchanges in perch somatic growth rate (21). In our statistical analysis, we accounted for the 67 \neffects of environmental variables known to plastically affect perch growth [i.e. primary 68 \nproductivity, water temperature, and perch density (23), see Material and methods] and, by 69 \nusing a smooth term on the Year class effect, we removed any a priori expectation concerning 70 \nthe shape of the temporal trend. We performed separate analyses for each basin of 71 \nWindermere because the two perch populations are considered distinct (30, 31), thus 72 \nproviding a natural replicate for hypothesis testing. Since life-history responses to pathogens 73 \nmay be sex-specific (28), we also performed separate analyses for each sex. In both basins of 74 \n 6\nthe lake, our results support the prediction that pike and pathogens induced selection in 75 \nopposite directions on perch body-size. 76 \n 77 \nResults and discussion 78 \n 79 \nBefore 1976, perch somatic growth rate generally increased in both basins and in both male 80 \nand female perch (Fig. 2C), in parallel with an overall increase in predation pressure (Fig. 81 \n2A). Short-term variations in predation pressure (Fig. 2A) were in remarkably close match 82 \nwith similar changes in perch growth in both basins (especially in males, Fig. 2C), supporting 83 \nthe prediction that pike selected for increased somatic growth in Windermere perch. A 84 \ncorrelation analysis revealed that predation pressure had a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 85 \npositive effect on perch somatic growth at lags ranging from 0 to 9 years, with the highest 86 \ncorrelation at a 5-years lag. This lag corresponds roughly to 1.25 to 5 perch generations since 87 \nmale perch in Windermere may mature at age-1 but mean age of mature fish in the catch was 88 \napproximately age-4. Interestingly, female perch responded less closely than male perch to 89 \nvariation in the predation pressure (Fig. 2C), presumably because females reached a size 90 \nrefuge faster than males (Sex effect in Table 1). Indeed, fast immature growth generally lasts 91 \nlonger in female than in male fish because females mature at an older age (29). After outbreak 92 \nof the pathogen in 1976, Windermere perch somatic growth decreased rapidly in both basins 93 \nand for both sexes (Fig. 2C) despite the fact that predation pressure remained high (Fig. 2A). 94 \nThis result supports the prediction that the pathogen selected for slow somatic growth in 95 \nperch, and further suggests that the strength of pathogen-induced selection overrode the 96 \nstrength of pike-induced selection (21, 22). Finally, perch somatic growth rate in 1995 97 \ndecreased to 1940s values in the north but not in the south basin (Fig. 2C), in accordance with 98 \n 7\nraw data observation of perch numbers (Fig. 1A), age (Fig. 1C) and size (Fig. 1D) showing 99 \nthat the infection was more severe in the north than in the south basin.  100 \nAntagonistic selection from multiple consumers on their joint prey may result in 101 \ncounterintuitive demographic effects. Indeed, while linear density-dependence predicts a 102 \nnegative impact of multiple consumers on each other (i.e., exploitative competition), 103 \nantagonistic selection on a joint resource can make consumers mutually beneficial foragers (5, 104 \n6). In Windermere, observations are consistent with the predictions that the effects of 105 \nantagonistic selection overrode the effects of exploitative competition and made pike and the 106 \npathogen mutually beneficial foragers. Indeed, signs of an externally similar disease on perch 107 \nwere reported as early as 1963 (27) but the spread of the pathogen and massive perch kill in 108 \n1976 coincided with a peak in predation pressure in both basins (Fig. 2A). Additionally, 109 \npredation pressure was higher in the north than in the south basin both before and after the 110 \nspread of the pathogen (Fig. 2A), and the infection was more severe in the north than in the 111 \nsouth basin (see above). Therefore, by increasing the proportion of large, fast-growing perch 112 \nwhich were more sensitive to infection, pike may have facilitated the spread of the pathogen. 113 \nThen, by selecting against slow somatic growth in perch, pike may have prevented perch from 114 \nmaximizing energy allocation to disease resistance (28) and may have favored the 115 \nmaintenance of high levels of pathogen prevalence. 116 \nIn turn, by preventing perch from reaching a size refuge the pathogen may have made 117 \nperch become easier prey for and weaker competitors with pike (16). This process has been 118 \nrecently demonstrated by the artificial removal of large prey (Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus) 119 \nfrom a Norwegian lake, which ultimately increased top predator numbers (Brown trout Salmo 120 \ntrutta) (32). In Windermere, examination of trends in pike numbers suggests a similar process 121 \ndriven by the pathogen. Indeed, at odds with a linear density-dependent effect, pike numbers 122 \nincreased markedly after invasion of the perch pathogen in Windermere (Fig. 1B). We 123 \n 8\npredicted that juvenile pike should have most strongly benefited from invasion of the perch 124 \npathogen because (i) juvenile pike were shown from diet data to be more directly in potential 125 \ncompetition with large perch (18-20) and (ii) juvenile pike eat at a higher rate than large pike 126 \nand are thus more susceptible to competition for food (20). To test this prediction, we used 127 \npike stock-recruitment models which explored the relationship between parental stock size in 128 \nyear y and the number of age-2 pike in year y+2 (see Materials and methods). These models 129 \nallowed us to estimate the effects of pathogen-induced trait changes in perch on the pike-130 \nperch interaction, while controlling for the effects of temperature, perch numbers and pike 131 \nnumbers (Table 1). As emphasized above, perch populations in the north and south basins of 132 \nWindermere should be considered distinct and only about 20% of pike disperse between the 133 \ntwo basins (14, 15). We therefore analyzed pike recruitment separately for the north and south 134 \nbasins. Our results clearly show that pathogen-induced trait changes in perch increased 135 \njuvenile pike survival by changing perch from being mainly a competitor to being mainly a 136 \nprey for pike.  137 \nPike recruitment rate (i.e., number of recruits per spawner) increased significantly in 138 \nboth basins after invasion of the pathogen (Pathogen effects in Table 1, intercepts in Fig. 2B). 139 \nThis increase was not the result of a higher number of eggs produced by female pike because 140 \nfemale pike reproductive investment decreased from 1963 to 1995 (21). Increased pike 141 \nrecruitment rate was also not due to a relaxation of density dependence (competition and 142 \ncannibalism) in the pike population because the strength of density dependence did not 143 \nchange significantly (SSB*Pathogen interactions in Table 1, slopes almost unchanged in Fig. 144 \n2B). Therefore, increased pike recruitment rate most likely reflected increased survival of 145 \nsmall pike due to pathogen-induced trait changes in perch. Modeling the effect of perch on 146 \npike recruitment rate supported this hypothesis. Pathogen invasion changed the effect of perch 147 \nfrom negative to positive (Perch*Pathogen interactions in Table 1, slopes changing from 148 \n 9\nnegative to positive in Fig. 2D), indicating that the pike-perch link was changed from a 149 \nmixture of predation and competition dominated by perch towards a simpler predator-prey 150 \nrelationship dominated by pike. Interestingly, perch traits were more severely shifted by the 151 \npathogen in the north than in the south basin (see above), driving a locally higher increase in 152 \npike recruitment and steeper change in the effect of perch on pike survival (Fig, 2D, Table 1). 153 \nThese results suggest that antagonistic selection from predators and pathogens on 154 \nWindermere perch body-size generated a mechanism similar to the so-called \"synergy\" [i.e. 155 \nsynergistic foraging rates (5, 6, 10)] which has been modeled to arise among multiple 156 \npredators when there is a trade-off in the prey for behavioral avoidance of the predators (5, 6). 157 \nTo our knowledge, our results provide the first empirical example of this synergistic effect 158 \nacting through prey life-history change. 159 \n 160 \nConclusions 161 \n 162 \nIt has been shown that behavioral disturbance of predation capacity and sensitivity to 163 \npredation in an invertebrate host (Gammarus spp.) by parasites can reverse species dominance 164 \nin an IGP hierarchy (17). Parasites have also been shown to indirectly increase algal growth 165 \nby reducing grazing capacity in a gastropod host (12). Our findings considerably expand the 166 \nscope for parasite-induced effects on ecosystems by showing synergistic effects between 167 \nparasites and predators acting through antagonistic selection on the prey. Antagonistic 168 \nselection on prey body-size (as depicted in Windermere) is a potentially strong ecosystem 169 \nmodifier because body-size determines a host of species traits that affect the structure and 170 \ndynamics of food webs (4, 33). Hence, in light of the abundance of parasites across systems 171 \n(11), size-selective predators and pathogens are likely to play an important role in the 172 \nstructuring and resilience of ecosystems. So far, synergistic foraging between multiple 173 \n 10\nconsumers (acting through a behavioral trade-off in the prey) has been consistently modeled 174 \nto favor species coexistence and food-web stability (5, 6). 175 \nAntagonistic selection leading to synergistic foraging rates has practical implications 176 \nsince it can magnify the effects of species introductions and human activities. For instance, 177 \ninvasive species will more strongly deplete native resource populations if they select in an 178 \nopposite direction compared to native predators or pathogens of the resource. Antagonistic 179 \nselection, by favoring species coexistence (5, 6), may also favor long-term persistence of 180 \ninvasive predators and parasites. In particular, our results underline that predators can 181 \ninfluence coevolution between parasite virulence and host resistance by impeding evolution 182 \nof resistance in the host (13, 34, 35). Finally, harvesting by humans often targets large 183 \nindividuals and induces body-size reduction in exploited populations (21). Hence, harvesting 184 \ncould select in an opposite direction to competitors and predators and magnify their effects. 185 \nManagement strategies ignoring potential effects of antagonistic selection on trophic 186 \ninteractions might lead to inappropriate management of ecological resources. 187 \n 188 \nMaterials and methods 189 \n 190 \nPerch growth modeling. Perch traps used for sampling were unselective for individuals 191 \nranging from 9 to 30 cm body length and thus captured both fast and slow growers for ages 192 \nranging from 2 to 6 years (23). However, age 5 and 6 perch became rare after the invasion of 193 \nthe pathogen in Windermere. Therefore, in order to confidently rule out possible effects of 194 \nsampling bias we restricted our growth analysis to perch caught from age-2 to age-4. We 195 \nmodeled temporal changes in Windermere perch somatic growth rate using a generalized 196 \nadditive model (mgcv library of R (36)) of the form: 197 \n\u03b5\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 ++\u00d7+\u00d7+++++++= )()( 2765432110 YcfTPTPhPPhTSBasAfBL  Eq(1) 198 \n 11\n 199 \nwhere BL stands for body length of individual i and year class Yc (n=67,457), A is the 200 \nindividual's age at capture, Bas is the basin in which the individual was captured, S is the 201 \nindividual's sex, T, Ph and P are mean temperature, mean phosphorus concentration and mean 202 \nperch density (small + large), respectively, experienced by the individual (i.e. from year Yc to 203 \nyear Yc+A), \u03b2s are slopes of the linear effects, \u03b20 is an intercept, \u03b5 is an error term, and f1 and 204 \nf2 are nonparametric smoothing functions (natural cubic splines fitted by generalized cross 205 \nvalidation (36)). In the model, interactions between temperature and the other biological 206 \ncovariates accounted for the thermal dependence of primary productivity and competitive 207 \ninteractions. Plots in Fig. 2C were produced with basin- and sex-specific models as described 208 \nin Eq(1) but in which Bas and S were dropped (north basin: n=17,321 males and n=3,279 209 \nfemales; south basin: n=40,904 males and n=5,953 females). 95% confidence limits around 210 \nthe Yc effect in Fig. 2C were computed using a modified wild bootstrap approach (37). 211 \nBriefly, the bootstrap distribution for the effect estimate was obtained by randomly inverting 212 \nthe signs of the errors from the model, adding these to the fitted values, and refitting the 213 \nmodel (repeated 500 times). To account for intra year-class correlation, all errors from a given 214 \nyear-class in a given bootstrap sample were either inverted or not with probability 0.5. 215 \nEstimates of the main effects of T, Ph and P in Table 1 were obtained from a model in which 216 \nthe interaction terms were omitted from Eq(1). We calculated predation pressure from pike on 217 \nperch as the natural log of the ratio of the numbers of all (age \u2265 2) pike on the number of 218 \nsmall (age-2) perch because pike target mainly small perch in Windermere (20). Finally, we 219 \ntested for the link between predation pressure and perch somatic growth using correlations 220 \nbetween the fitted Yc effect (from 4 basin- and sex-specific models as in Fig. 2C) and 221 \npredation pressure from pike on perch in year class Yc-t where t varied from 0 to 16 years. 222 \n 223 \n 12\nPike recruitment modeling. We modeled pathogen- associated change in pike recruitment 224 \nusing linear stock-recruitment models (38) of the form: 225 \n 226 \n\u03b5\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2 +\u00d7++++= PaSSBSSBPTSSBR 43210)\/ln(  Eq(2) 227 \n 228 \nwhere R stands for the number of pike recruits (i.e. age-2 pike) in year y and basin Bas (n=50 229 \nfor each basin), SSB is pike spawning stock biomass (i.e. number of spawners) in year y-2 and 230 \nbasin Bas, T and P are mean water temperature and mean perch density (small + large) 231 \nexperienced by the recruits from year y-2 to year y, Pa is the pathogen (i.e. presence or 232 \nabsence), \u03b2s are slopes of the effects, \u03b20 is an intercept, and \u03b5 is an error term. We modeled 233 \nchanges in the pike-perch interaction using a model similar to Eq(2) except that P and SSB 234 \nwere inverted in Eq(2). In our models, the response (natural log of the R\/SSB ratio) measured 235 \nrecruitment rate, i.e. the number of recruits per spawner (38). The SSB effect in the right hand 236 \nside of Eq(2) captured cannibalism and competition (density-dependence) in the pike 237 \npopulation (38), and the SSB*Pa interaction tested for an effect of the perch pathogen on 238 \ndensity dependence in the pike population. The P effect captured predation and competition 239 \nbetween perch and juvenile pike, while the P*Pa interaction tested for an effect of pathogen-240 \ninduced trait changes in perch on the pike-perch trophic interactions. Estimation of the main 241 \neffects of T, P, SSB, and Pa in Table 1 were obtained from a model in which the interaction 242 \nterm was omitted from Eq(2). Predicted values in Figs. 2B and 2D were computed from 2 243 \ndifferent models as in Eq(2) but in which only the focal terms (SSB and Pa in Fig. 2B; P and 244 \nPa in Fig. 2D) were kept. 245 \n 13\nAcknowledgments.
