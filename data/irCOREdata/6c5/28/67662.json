Box 3000, FIN-90014, Finland\n2Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory, Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland\n3Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland\nReceived: 7 December 2005 \u2013 Revised: 13 April 2006 \u2013 Accepted: 19 May 2006 \u2013 Published: 9 August 2006\nAbstract. In this paper we describe a new method to be used\nfor the polar cap boundary (PCB) determination in the night-\nside ionosphere by using the EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR)\nfield-aligned measurements by the 42-m antenna and south-\nward directed low-elevation measurements by the ESR 32m\nantenna or northward directed low-elevation measurements\nby the EISCAT VHF radar at Troms\u00f8. The method is based\non increased electron temperature (Te) caused by precipi-\ntating particles on closed field lines. Since the Svalbard\nfield-aligned measurement provides the reference polar cap\nTe height profile, the method can be utilised only when the\nPCB is located between Svalbard and the mainland. Compar-\nison with the Polar UVI images shows that the radar-based\nmethod is generally in agreement with the PAE (poleward\nauroral emission) boundary from Polar UVI.\nThe new technique to map the polar cap boundary was ap-\nplied to a substorm event on 6 November 2002. Simultane-\nous measurements by the MIRACLE magnetometers enabled\nus to put the PCB location in the framework of ionospheric\nelectrojets. During the substorm growth phase, the polar cap\nexpands and the region of the westward electrojet shifts grad-\nually more apart from the PCB. The substorm onset takes\nplace deep within the region of closed magnetic field region,\nseparated by about 6\u20137\u25e6 in latitude from the PCB in the iono-\nsphere. We interpret the observations in the framework of the\nnear-Earth neutral line (NENL) model of substorms. After\nthe substorm onset, the reconnection at the NENL reaches\nwithin 3 min the open-closed field line boundary and then\nthe PCB moves poleward together with the poleward bound-\nary of the substorm current wedge. The poleward expansion\noccurs in the form of individual bursts, which are separated\nby 2\u201310 min, indicating that the reconnection in the magne-\ntotail neutral line is impulsive.

Ionosphere (Polar ionosphere) \u2013 Magneto-\nspheric physics (Polar cap phenomena; Storms and sub-\nstorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe polar cap is a region around a geomagnetic pole, which\nis surrounded by the auroral oval. It is a unique region in the\nnear-Earth space, since the magnetic field lines emanating\nfrom the polar cap are open and entry of solar wind plasma\nto the polar cap ionosphere can take place to form the polar\nrain precipitation.\nThe plasma flow within the polar cap ionosphere is typ-\nically antisunward with return flows on the dawn and dusk\nsides, roughly within the auroral oval. It has been shown that\nthis plasma convection pattern can arise from the merging\nof the southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) with\nthe geomagnetic field lines on the dayside magnetopause\n(Dungey, 1961). During northward IMF, merging may take\nplace poleward of the cusps. Dayside merging creates open\nfield lines, which are carried away with the solar wind. Field\nlines can be returned in a closed state by nightside reconnec-\ntion in the distant neutral line (DNL). The balance between\nthe dayside and nightside reconnection rates determines the\namount of open flux and is related to the size of the polar cap\n(Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). Russell (1972) suggested\nthat the two processes may be viewed as two separate time-\ndependent processes. This means that while dayside merging\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1906 A. T. Aikio et al.: Polar cap boundary during a substorm\nis thought to be controlled by the IMF, magnetotail reconnec-\ntion may not have a similar strong IMF dependence.\nIn addition to direct dissipation, the energy tapped from\nthe solar wind is stored as magnetic energy in the geomag-\nnetic tail lobes and can be released during substorms, when a\nnear-Earth neutral line (NENL) may form (McPherron et al.,\n1973). The factors that control the formation and location\nof the NENL are still under debate. The reconnection at the\nNENL starts on closed field lines but may proceed to open\nfield lines, which results in a sudden contraction of the polar\ncap on the night side.\nIt has been shown theoretically that the plasma flow\nthrough the open-closed boundary in the ionosphere can be\nutilized to estimate the reconnection electric field in the mag-\nnetotail (Vasyliunas, 1984). Crucial for this method is, how-\never, how accurately the open-closed boundary (OCB) can\nbe determined. The ionospheric projection of the OCB is\nthe polar cap boundary (PCB). The most straightforward way\nto identify the PCB is from satellite particle measurements:\nby studying the cutoff of polar rain electrons or velocity\ndispersed ion signatures, type-2 (VDIS-2) (Sotirelis et al.,\n1999). Polar rain electrons (<1 keV) stem in open field lines\nfrom the solar wind, whereas VDIS-2 are assumed to be orig-\ninated from the reconnection site and subsequently affected\nby the convection electric field.\nIn the ionosphere, the poleward boundary of the auroral\noval is generally used as a proxy for the PCB. The oval con-\nsists of two parts: the discrete oval lies embedded in the dif-\nfuse oval, which may extend both poleward and equatorward\nof the discrete oval (e.g. Kauristie et al., 1999 and references\ntherein). However, one should note that the real PCB may lie\nat higher latitudes than the poleward boundary of the oval\nin a situation where no electron precipitation occurs from\nclosed field lines mapping in the vicinity of the distant neu-\ntral line, but rather from field lines located earthward of the\nDNL. Since this issue has remained unsolved, the best what\ncan be done with ionospheric measurements is to use the par-\nticle\/optical boundary as a proxy for the PCB. Below we will\ngive a short summary of the ionospheric methods used for\ndetermining the PCB.\nParticle boundaries can be studied by low-altitude polar\norbiting satellites (Newell et al., 1996a,b). For automated\ndetection of boundaries by the DMSP satellites, definitions\nfor different boundaries have been constructed. For pole-\nward boundaries, the following definitions are of interest:\nb3b: the polewardmost electron acceleration event, b5e: the\npoleward boundary of the auroral oval as determined by an\nabrupt drop in the electron energy flux, b5i: same for ions\nand b6: poleward boundary of subvisual drizzle roughly ad-\njacent to the oval. Boundary 5 is identified by a sharp drop\nin energy fluxes by a factor of at least four. Newell et al.\n(1996a,b) note that under active conditions, boundary 5 usu-\nally represent the poleward boundary of precipitation. How-\never, often and especially during quiet conditions, a region of\nlow-energy structured ion and electron precipitation at low\nflux levels exists, which is called subvisual drizzle. When a\nsatellite is moving poleward, the subvisual drizzle terminates\neither when fluxes drop or when polar rain is encountered.\nGlobal images of the auroral oval can also be used for PCB\ndetermination. Baker et al. (2000) compared the poleward\nauroral emission (PAE) boundary from the Polar Ultraviolet\nImager (UVI) with the DMSP poleward auroral oval (b5e)\nboundary. Detection of the b6 boundary by Polar UVI was\nnot considered realistic. The PAE was determined by using\na fixed threshold of auroral brightness as well as a fixed ratio\nof oval brightness to the maximum value. The optimal values\nfound were 4.3 photons cm\u22122s\u22121 and 0.3, respectively. The\nthreshold value was very close to that used by Brittnacher et\nal. (1999), 4 photons cm\u22122s\u22121. However, Baker et al. (2000)\nfound a systematic error of 1\u25e6 in the PCB by PAE as com-\npared to the particle boundaries. On the other hand, in a\ncase study, Wild et al. (2004) found good correspondence\nbetween the PAE by the IMAGE satellite FUV WIC sensor\nand particle boundaries by FAST and DMSP satellites in the\ndawn sector. However, the 04\u201306 MLT sector showed a dis-\ncrepancy between the WIC (140\u2013180 nm) and SI-13 (130\u2013\n140 nm) sensors: auroral emissions recorded by SI-13 ex-\ntended to latitudes significantly poleward of the emissions\nrecorded by WIC. So, probably the sensitivity of the sensor\nplays a role. Global images by the Polar UVI instrument\ntogether with low-altitude satellite measurements has been\nused to monitor the polar cap area by Milan et al. (2003,\n2004) and by IMAGE SI12 (proton aurora) instrument by\nHubert et al. (2006).\nThe first attempt to use the incoherent scatter radar (ISR)\nfor PCB detection and reconnection rate estimation in the\nnightside ionosphere was made by de la Beaujardiere et al.\n(1991). The PCB was identified as the poleward boundary of\nthe auroral region by following the electron density contour\nof 3\u00b71011 m\u22123 at an altitude of 125 km. For that purpose, the\nradar was scanning in the meridional plane providing a tem-\nporal resolution of 3 to 5 min and not very wide latitudinal\ncoverage. Utilising a similar ISR experiment, Blanchard et\nal. (1995, 1996) estimated the reconnection rate mapped to\nthe ionosphere, but they used ground-based optical images\nof the 630.0 nm emission for PCB determination. Doe et al.\n(1997) have also used scanning ISR measurements. They\ncalculated the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons\nfrom the measured electron densities and compared those\nwith the PCB determined by the all-sky images of the 630.0-\nnm emission.\nOstgaard et al. (2005) used the EISCAT VHF radar point-\ning at low elevation angle to a poleward direction together\nwith the IMAGE satellite FUV WIC camera. The method\nwas based on the measurement of the increased electron tem-\nperature Te in the nightside F region. Diffuse electron precip-\nitation from the plasma sheet boundary layer or more ener-\ngetic electron precipitation in the equatorward drifting arcs is\nexpected to increase the electron temperature in the F region.\nA median filter was applied to analysed Te data to remove\nAnn.

Aikio et al.: Polar cap boundary during a substorm 1907\nunreasonable values and then the boundary was determined\nfor eleven different electron temperatures. The Te value,\nwhich correlated best with the FUV images, was selected.\nIn the two events studied, values of 2500 K and 1800 K were\ntaken to represent the PCB, respectively.\nOn the dayside, many IS radar studies have been made\nin the vicinity of cusp to study pulsed magnetopause recon-\nnection and flux transfer events (e.g. Moen et al., 2004 and\nreferences therein).\nCoherent HF radars record the boundary between low and\nhigh spectral width signals, which can also be used as a\nproxy for the PC boundary, as demonstrated by Chisham et\nal. (2004), although this technique is uncertain in the dawn\nsector. At present, it is unclear precisely what geophysical\nstructure these boundaries represent (Wild et al., 2004).\nThe typical convection pattern in the ionosphere consists\nof two cells, as discussed above. On the dusk (dawn) side,\nthe ionospheric flow is eastward (westward) at the high lat-\nitudes and westward (eastward) at lower latitudes. The bor-\nder between these two flow directions is called the convec-\ntion reversal boundary (CRB). Sometimes the CRB is taken\nas a proxy for the PCB (e.g. Nishitani et al., 2002). How-\never, it has been shown that in some cases the CRB occurs\nin the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) and hence on\nclosed field lines (Senior et al., 1994). The CRB is deter-\nmined by the convection electric field, whereas the magnetic\nconvection reversal boundary (MCRB), recorded by ground\nmagnetometers, is produced by the electrojets. Within the\nsubstorm bulge, a westward electrojet is flowing, known as\nthe substorm current wedge (SCW), which corresponds to an\neastward plasma flow. Typically, the MCRB is located 0.5\u2013\n1.5\u25e6 of latitude poleward of the CRB in the morning sector\n(e.g. Amm et al., 2000). In the event discussed by Amm\net al. (2003), the PCB measured by Cluster ion instrument\nwas located 3\u20134\u25e6 of latitude poleward of the MCRB in the\nmidnight sector. No systematic study of the relationship be-\ntween the poleward boundary of the electrojets (MCRB) and\nthe PCB has been conducted to our knowledge.\nThis paper presents a new method to be used for polar cap\nboundary estimation based on EISCAT radar measurements\nof electron temperature changes over a large latitude range in\nthe nightside ionosphere. In the next section, we explain the\nexperimental setup and data analysis and verify the method\nby the Polar UVI images. Then we apply the method to a\nsubstorm event on 6 November 2002 and study especially\nthe relationship between the polar cap boundary and location\nof the electrojets.\n2 Data analysis\n2.1 EISCAT measurements\nIn all data analysis, we have used the aacgm (altitude ad-\njusted corrected geomagnetic coordinates), for which any\nFig res\n6870 6674 7276\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nBeams of the Tromso VHF (blue) and Svalbard ESR 32m radar (green)\ncgmlatitude \/ deg\nal\ntit\nud\ne \n\/ k\nm\nESR Tro \nPolar cap Te enhanced\nin the oval\nVHF UHF\nESR 32mESR 42m\nLYR TRO\nFig. 1.

Schematic figure of the method used in determining the PCB\nfrom the EISCAT meas rements. Gr y-shaded region represents t e\nauroral oval, where Te is enhanced over a wide altitude range.\ntwo points connected by a magnetic field line have the same\ncoordinates (Baker and Wing, 1989), and for brevity, we just\ndenote them as cgm.\nThe incoherent scatter EISCAT VHF radar, located in\nTroms\u00f8 (geographic: 69.59\u25e6 N, 19.22\u25e6 E, cgm: 66.58\u25e6,\n102.94\u25e6), was pointed to 30\u25e6 elevation with azimuth of 0.5\u25e6\nto the west from geographic north. The EISCAT Svalbard\nRadar (ESR) 32m antenna, located in Longyearbyen (geo-\ngraphic: 78.15\u25e6 N, 16.03\u25e6 E, cgm: 75.22\u25e6, 111.94\u25e6), was di-\nrected at 30\u25e6 elevation to azimuth of 179.5\u25e6 to the east from\ngeographic north. So, the radar beams were co-aligned be-\ntween Troms\u00f8 and Longyearbyen with a longitude separation\nof about 3\u25e6. In addition, the ESR 42m antenna was measur-\ning field-aligned. The ESR measurement started at 18:00 UT,\nbut the VHF measurement later, at 20:24 UT.\nThe basic idea of the measurement configuration is shown\nin Fig. 1. Electron precipitation in the nightside ionosphere\nincreases the electron temperature Te due to the collisional\nheating of background plasma by the primary and secondary\nelectrons. Since the energy flux of precipitating electrons in\nthe oval is typically higher than that in the polar cap (polar\nrain precipitation), electron temperature changes can be used\nto track the polar cap boundary. When a radar is measuring\nat a low elevation angle, the Te profile along the beam de-\npends both on the horizontal variations in the temperature as\nwell as the height profile of the temperature. Typically, Te\nincreases with altitude. When the PCB is situated between\nTroms\u00f8 and Longyearbyen, the ESR 42m antenna, measur-\ning in the field-aligned direction, can provide the height pro-\nfile of Te in the polar cap. If now the polar cap Te altitude\nprofile is subtracted from the Te altitude profile along the low\nelevation antenna beam, a positive value indicates that at the\ncorresponding point Te is enhanced. By searching the pole-\nwardmost point where the temperature difference is positive,\nthe PCB can be located.\nIn practice, the critical factor in such a calculation are the\nerrors of the analysed temperature values.

The ESR 32m and VHF beam projections are shown in the figure.\nThe range gates in the analysis were increased as range\nincreased. A typical example of the VHF Te altitude pro-\nfile is shown in Fig. 2b. In order to be able to subtract\nfrom the VHF\/ESR 32m data the corresponding altitudes\nof the ESR 42m data, all the altitude profiles were inter-\npolated with a height resolution of 5.7 km, which in lati-\ntude is about 10 km for the 30\u25e6 elevation angle. However,\nthe real resolution is determined by the range resolution of\nthe original analysed data, which within the studied lati-\ntude ranges (see below) provides latitude resolutions from\n0.18 to 0.36\u25e6 cgmLat for the VHF radar and from 0.15 to\n0.36\u25e6 cgmLat for the ESR 32m radar.\nThe lowest altitude, where the method worked, was about\n150 km for the VHF and 200 km for the ESR 32m radar, set-\nting the lowest latitude to about 69\u25e6 cgmLat for the VHF\nand the highest latitude to 73\u25e6 for the ESR 32m radar. At\nvery long ranges, the signal-to-noise ratio of the data became\nsmall, so that effectively the VHF radar could probe the lat-\nitude span from 69\u25e6 to 73.5 or 74\u25e6 and ESR 32m from 69\u25e6\nto 72.5 or 73\u25e6 (the searched latitude region was varied a lit-\ntle according to ionospheric conditions affecting the analysed\ndata quality).\nThe result of subtraction of data in Fig. 2a from that in\nFig. 2b is displayed in the left panel of Fig. 3 for latitude\nrange of 69 to 74\u25e6cgmLat. Since the 1Te profile often fluc-\ntuated around the zero line, we made a routine to look for\nthe highest latitude where 1Te \u2212 error stayed above zero to\nlocate the PCB. In Fig. 3 this latitude is 71.4\u25e6 for the VHF\nradar, while the actual curve crosses the zero line at some-\nwhat higher latitude. Note, that during this time interval, the\nsearch was limited below latitudes of 73.5\u25e6, so the single data\npoint at an altitude of 500 km (Fig.2b) was not taken into ac-\ncount.\nFor comparison, the corresponding temperature difference\nheight profile is shown also for the ESR 32m radar in the\nright panel of Fig. 3. During this time interval, the estimated\nPCB value of 71.5\u25e6 cgmLat is very close to that by the VHF\nradar. Fig. 3 also shows, that for the experiments used, the\nerrors were typically larger for the ESR 32m data than for the\nVHF data.\nSingle points in the altitude profile may have very\nlarge errors (especially close to the highest\/lowest altitudes\nsearched) and therefore it turned out to be necessary to check\nmanually all the PCB values from the automatic routine and\nreject false points. Those points were easy to identify from\nthe time series plot, since they were typically sudden jumps\nto the edges of the searched latitude region.\n2.2 Comparison of Polar UVI and EISCAT polar cap\nboundaries\nThe Polar satellite was imaging the Northern Hemisphere\nduring 18:03\u201321:01 UT and in this work we use data from\nthe UVI imager with the LBHl (Lyman-Birge-Hopfield spec-\ntrum, long wavelengths, 160\u2013180 nm) filter (Torr et al.,\n1995).

From\nthese latitudinal intensity profiles, the poleward auroral emis-\nsion (PAE) latitudes were determined by using the thresh-\nold value of 4.3 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Baker et al., 2000; Brit-\ntnacher et al., 1999). One such example is shown in Fig. 4,\nat 20:42:55 UT when the Polar satellite is already at quite a\nlow latitude. The PAE latitude is marked by a white line in\nthe figure and the locations of the ESR 32m and VHF radar\nbeams are shown by red vectors. In this particular case, the\nPAE latitude was 71.4\u25e6 and the PCB by ESR 32m and VHF\n(see Fig. 3) was 71.4\u25e6 and 71.5\u25e6, respectively.\nIn seventeen of the UVI images, PAE boundary values\nwere above 73\u25e6 and thus not detectable by the ESR 32m\nradar. The remaining points are compared to the ESR 32m\nPCB and the result is shown in Fig. 5 by circles. Seven com-\nmon points are found for Polar UVI PAE and the VHF PCB\nand those are marked by squares in Fig. 5. Ideally, the points\nwould lie in the y=x curve. However, since the PCB values\nare based on the highest latitude where the curve+error stays\nabove zero, it is presumable that the method gives somewhat\nlower latitude values than the curve alone would give. There-\nfore, we made a fit of the form y=x+c to the data sets and\nas a result, we obtained c=0.32\u25e6 for the ESR 32m data and\nc=0.31\u25e6 for the VHF data. So, typically about 0.3\u25e6 should be\nadded to the latitude value obtained by the automatic routine.\nThis comparison shows that the PAE by the Polar UV Im-\nager corresponds quite well to the poleward boundary of the\nincreased Te region in the ionosphere, which we use as a\nproxy for the polar cap boundary.\nFurther verification of the method could be obtained by\nusing satellite data, but only one DMSP satellite pass oc-\ncurred within the area imaged by Polar UVI and measured\nby EISCAT during the studied time interval. At about\n18:41:10 UT the DMSP F15 satellite encountered both the\nb1e \u201czero-energy\u201d electron boundary and the b2e boundary,\nwhere the electron average energy stays constant with lati-\ntude (start of the main plasma sheet) (Newell et al., 1996a,b).\nThe b3b boundary, the polewardmost electron acceleration\nevent, was crossed at 18:43:40 and b6, the poleward bound-\nary of weak precipitation adjacent to the oval, at 18:43:54.\nThose four boundaries are shown by crosses overlaid on the\nPolar UVI image taken at 18:40:15 UT in Fig. 6 and an ap-\nproximate correspondence seems to be visible. However,\nthe PAE boundary, as shown by the white line at an latitude\nof 74.2\u25e6, is located clearly poleward of the b6 boundary at\n71.6\u25e6. A possible explanation can be found in the time dif-\nference: the DMSP satellite passed the poleward boundary\nof precipitation about 3.5 min later than the UVI image was\ntaken. The DMSP pass was during a dynamical substorm\nsituation. The ESR 32m data supports the interpretation of\nthe temporal evolution, i.e. during PAE determination at\n18:40:15 UT Te was enhanced beyond 73\u25e6 (and hence could\nnot be exactly determined), but 18:42:40\u201318:44:42 UT the\nPCB had moved to 70.5\u25e6(+0.3\u25e6 due to the method), which is\nvery close to the b3b value of 70.8\u25e6 and not far from the b6\nboundary of 71.6\u25e6. In addition to the temporal evolution, the\nUVI image shows an azimuthal gradient in precipitation. The\nDMSP satellite goes along the evening side boundary of the\nselected MLT zone, where a double oval-like configuration is\nseen. This is confirmed by the DMSP particle spectra, which\nshow a gap in precipitation in the middle of the pass (data not\nshown). So, all in all the poleward edge of energetic precip-\nitation by the DMSP satellite seems to be in agreement with\nthe EISCAT defined PCB boundary and the difference to the\nPAE boundary can be explained by the temporal change in\nprecipitation.\n3 Substorm event and polar cap boundary\nIn this section, we apply the method to locate the PCB to a\nsubstorm event on 6 November 2002.\nSubstorm activity took place in the Scandinavian sector\nfrom 18:00 to about 20:30 UT and after that a new substorm\ngrowth phase started, close to the local magnetic midnight,\nwhich is at about 21:00 UT.

Geophys., 24, 1905\u20131917, 2006\n1912 A. T. Aikio et al.: Polar cap boundary during a substorm\nThe polar cap boundary from the ESR 32m (black line)\nand the VHF (blue line) radar are also shown in Fig. 7 (with\n0.3\u25e6 cgmLat added due to the method, see the previous sec-\ntion). In the end of the previous substorm (20:00\u201320:30 UT),\nthe poleward boundary of the westward electrojet and the\nPCB coincide within the uncertainty limits. After 20:30 UT,\nthe relatively weak WEJ starts to migrate to lower latitudes.\nThe PCB moves to lower latitudes together with the WEJ un-\ntil about 21:10 UT, after which a clear separation of the PCB\nand the WEJ region takes place.\nAt 21:34 UT a sudden enhancement of the WEJ occurs at\nvery low latitudes, center at about 63\u25e6 cgmLat, which is as-\nsociated with only a small expansion of the WEJ to higher\nlatitudes, from 65 to 66\u25e6 cgmLat. The widening to lower lat-\nitudes is more pronounced. The minimum of the associated\nmagnetic bay is \u2013320 nT. Because of the lack of a signifi-\ncant (>2\u25e6 cgmLat) poleward expansion, we classify this on-\nset preferably as a pseudobreakup (see, e.g. Aikio et al., 1999\nand references therein).\nAt 21:42 UT a rapid poleward expansion of the WEJ takes\nplace, in connection with a sudden brightening of the most\nequatorward arc in the KEV (66.32\u25e6 cgmLat) all-sky camera\nfield-of-view (data not shown). We identify the 21:42 UT on-\nset as substorm onset. The mid-latitude Pi2 (York and Nur-\nmija\u00a8rvi) show onset at about 21:34 (pseudobreakup onset),\nwith further amplification of pulsations at 21:42 UT (sub-\nstorm onset).\nDuring the onsets, the PCB was located at 69.5\u2013\n70\u25e6 cgmLat. So, the ionospheric location of the pseudo-\nbreakup and substorm onset was situated about 6\u20137\u25e6 cgmLat\nequatorward of the polar cap boundary. The duration of the\npseudobreakup was 8 min.\nTo study the evolution of the PCB and the WEJ in more\ndetail during substorm expansion, we show Fig. 8. The sub-\nsequent poleward expansion after the substorm onset was\nvery rapid, it took only about 3 min (11 min) for the poleward\nboundary of the substorm current wedge to reach to PCB af-\nter the substorm (pseudobreakup) onset. The poleward ex-\npansion of the SCW is burstlike and even the initial expan-\nsion seems to consist of two individual excursions poleward.\nDuring the first 30 min of expansion phase, at least five indi-\nvidual bursts can be distinquished. Each of them starts with\na poleward expansion of the SCW poleward boundary and\nis followed by an increase in the equivalent current density\nat lower latitudes within the main oval. Intensifications in\nthe current density are latitude dispersed with high latitudes\naffected first.\nWe have numbered the bursts in Fig. 8. The identifica-\ntion of individual bursts is not quite unambiquous, but we\nconsider bursts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 very clear and suggest that\nsome substructure would exist, e.g. burst 3 would consist of\ntwo parts, 3a and 3b. Burst 0 is associated with the pseudo-\nbreakup. The separation of bursts 1 and 2 is 2 min, 2 and 3\n6 min, 3a and 3b 2 min, 3b and 4 7 min and 4 and 5 10 min.\nBursts 1 and 2 bring the SCW adjacent to the PCB. Unfor-\ntunately, the VHF Te profile contained too many points with\nlarge errors during the first 10 min of substorm onset to be\nused for the PCB determination. However, the ESR 32m\ndata provided the estimate. The small contraction of the\nSCW poleward boundary after burst 2 is not accompanied\nby a similar motion in the PCB. Burst 3 brings the SCW\nagain adjacent to the PCB and after that, the SCW and PCB\nmove together until end of burst 4, after which the pole-\nward boundary of the SCW again separates a little from the\nPCB. At about 22:10 UT, the PCB is located at a latitude\nof 74\u25e6 cgmLat, which is the highest latitude, which can be\nobserved with the radar method in this case (marked with\nthe horizontal dotted line). Burst 5 occurs at about 22:10 UT\nand this burst brings the poleward boundary of the SCW (and\nobviously also the PCB, though it can\u2019t be traced anymore)\nto the latitude of Longyearbyen (75.5\u25e6 cgmLat), so that pre-\ncipitation fills also the field-aligned ESR 42m antenna beam\n(data not shown). After burst 5, the westward electrojet is\ndivided into two parts: one flowing in the main oval and the\nother at high latitudes. Between these regions, no significant\nelectrojet flows, so probably a double oval configuration is\nformed (Elphinstone et al., 1995).\nIn the EISCAT time-height\/latitude colour surface profiles\nof different parameters, some equatorward or poleward mov-\ning structures could be identified. We traced some of the\nmost pronounced structures and could identify an equator-\nward moving auroral structure emanating from the PCB at\nabout 22:10 UT, which is added to Fig. 8. The auroral struc-\nture was first seen by the ESR radar as an enhancement\nof electron density (dark green curve), then at higher alti-\ntudes and longer ranges, as an enhancement in the electron\ntemperature (red curve). Then the VHF radar caught it: at\nlonger ranges and higher altitudes as an enhancement of Te\n(magenta curve), and finally when the structure approached\nTroms\u00f8 and came to lower altitudes within the beam, as an\nenhancement of Ne (outside the plotted time span). So, even\nthough we don\u2019t have optical data, we are confident that we\nobserve an auroral structure. Since we have no optical data\navailable, the shape of the structure is not known. The longi-\ntudinal width of the structure in this case is at least 3\u25e6, which\nis the separation of the two EISCAT beams. The auroral\nstructure had an equatorward velocity component of about\n400 m\/s. We will discuss these observations in more detail in\nthe next section.\n4 Discussion\nWe will first summarise the new method we have used for\nthe PCB determination.

(2005). By using simultaneous opti-\ncal measurements with the IMAGE FUV WIC camera, they\nsearched a fixed value for the increased Te to be used as a\nproxy for the PCB. A fixed value may be problematic, since\nfor low elevation radar measurements, different latitudes cor-\nrespond to different altitudes and, in general, Te depends on\naltitude. In this work, we compare the low elevation tem-\nperature profile to the temperature altitude profile in the po-\nlar cap. For the method to work, Longyearbyen (the site of\nESR measurements) must be in the polar cap. In addition, no\ncross-polar arcs may be in the field-of-view of the ESR 42m\nantenna. Polar cap patches didn\u2019t seem to affect the temper-\nature profiles.\nComparison with the Polar UVI LBHl band showed that\nthe method is viable at least in some conditions. The mea-\nsurements in this study are made in the nightside winter iono-\nsphere, during substorm growth and expansion.\nThe advantages of the method are the high temporal and\nspatial resolution. The resolutions to be achieved depend on\nthe radar codes used (their efficiency) and finally on the res-\nolutions used in the data analysis, which rely on ionospheric\nconditions. The primary factor is electron density: for large\ndensities high temporal and spatial resolutions can be used\nwhereas for low-density ionosphere the resolutions must be\nreduced. In this study, we utilised 1 and 2 min temporal reso-\nlutions and spatial resolutions which in latitude ranged from\nabout 0.2\u25e6 to 0.4\u25e6. This method can also provide a continu-\nous determination of the PCB for several hours, unlike low-\naltitude satellite measurements. The disadvantage is that the\nPCB can be located only at one point and no azimuthal infor-\nmation is gained with a fixed beam position. If two radars are\navailable, as in this study (VHF and the ESR 32m antenna),\nthe PCB can be located at two points. However, since during\nthe experiments the longitudinal separation of antenna beams\nwas only 3\u25e6, the differences were small. In the future, one\ncould plan experiments, where the low-elevation antenna(s)\nwould move and provide a limited azimuthal view.\nThe new technique to map the polar cap boundary was ap-\nplied to a substorm event. Simultaneous measurements by\nthe MIRACLE magnetometers enabled us to put the PCB lo-\ncation in the framework of ionospheric electrojets. In the\nfollowing, we will discuss the observations in the light of the\ncurrent understanding of substorm dynamics.\nDuring a substorm growth phase, the magnetic flux in the\ntail lobes increases, cross-tail current intensifies and the po-\nlar cap expands, moving the auroral oval equatorward. In\nthe studied event, this occurs 20:20\u201321:34 UT. An interest-\ning feature is that while the PCB and the westward electrojet\nfirst move together equatorward, during the last 15 min of the\ngrowth phase the WEJ shifts gradually to lower latitudes and\nseparates more and more from the PCB.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1905\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 1905\u20131917, 2006\n1914 A. T. Aikio et al.: Polar cap boundary during a substorm\nIt is generally accepted that close to a substorm onset, both\nthe formation of the near-Earth neutral line (NENL) and the\ntail current disruption (CD) take place. The main dispute is\nthe order of events. In the NENL model, the substorm starts\nwith a formation of a neutral line in the mid-tail (20\u201330RE),\nwhich produces earthward-directed high speed flows trans-\nporting flux, mass and energy into the near-Earth region. As a\nconsequence, the near-Earth cross tail current disrupts. In the\nCD model the primary cause for substorm onset are plasma\ninstabilities developing in the near-Earth region at downtail\ndistances of 6\u201310 Re, which lead to the current disruption and\nthe substorm current wedge formation. A rarefaction wave\npropagates tailwards and launches reconnection in the mid-\ntail (Lui, 1996; Shiokawa et al., 1998).\nIn the ionosphere, the SCW can easily be located by mag-\nnetometers. However, there is no generally accepted signa-\nture for the NENL in the ionosphere. At the moment re-\nconnection at the NENL in the mid-tail reaches open field\nlines, a plasmoid is formed and reconnection starts to destroy\nopen flux, which can be visible as the poleward expansion of\nthe oval (contraction of the polar cap) in the nightside iono-\nsphere.\nPseudobreakups are often observed prior to substorm on-\nsets. Pseudobreakups are characterized as localized, rela-\ntively weak and short-lived events. However, the most ob-\nvious criterion to separate pseudobreakup from substorm on-\nset is the lack of significant poleward expansion (Ohtani et\nal., 1993; Aikio et al., 1999). Several studies have shown\nthat pseudobreakups don\u2019t differ from substorms in magne-\ntospheric signatures: they are associated with dipolarizations\n(Ohtani et al., 1993; Koskinen et al., 1993) and even recon-\nnection at the NENL (Aikio et al., 1999).\nThe data available in this event supports the well known\nfact that substorms start usually well inside the closed field\nline region. We are not able to tell which process happens\nfirst in the magnetotail: NENL formation or disruption of\nthe cross-tail current. We see the intensification of the WEJ\nat pseudobreakup onset, which we interpret as a partial dis-\nruption of the tail current and the initial build-up of the sub-\nstorm current wedge. In several studies, it has been shown\nthat reconnection at the NENL starts within a few minutes\nof pseudobreakup or substorm onset. However, Baker et\nal. (2002) studied an event where reconnection in the mid-tail\npreceeded the ground onset even by 7 min. One possibility is\nthat during a pseudobreakup, reconnection occurs at low rate.\nThe rapid poleward expansion at substorm onset is probably\nrelated to the increase in the reconnection rate at the NENL.\nIn this study, it took 3 min (11 min) from the substorm (pseu-\ndobreakup) onset for the SCW to expand to the polar cap\nboundary, which may be interpreted as the time for enhanced\nreconnection at the NENL to reach open lobe field lines. Af-\nter that, the PCB (open-closed boundary) contracted pole-\nward together with the expanding substorm current wedge.\nThe poleward expansions of the SCW and the PCB oc-\ncurred burstlike and at least five individual bursts separated\nby 2\u201310 min were observed during the first half an hour. The\nactual duration of the rapid poleward expansion in the events\nwas typically a few minutes. The observation of burstlike de-\nvelopment of substorm expansion is not new. E.g. Nakamura\net al. (1994) noted that expansion phase consits typically of\na number of injections and expansions, each with timescales\nof 2\u20138 min. Aikio et al. (1999) found that pseudobreakups\nand substorm intensifications were separated by about 5 to\n15 min. Sergeev et al. (2000) suggests that the characteris-\ntic time scale of the bursts, visible in many ionospheric and\nmagnetospheric parameters, is typically 2\u20133 min.\nFigure 8 shows that in events 1\u20134, the sudden poleward\nexpansion is followed by an intensification of the westward\nelectrojet at lower latitudes, within the main oval. The inten-\nsification of the electrojet is associated with enhanced pre-\ncipitation, as evidenced by the field-aligned UHF radar at\nTroms\u00f8 (data not shown). The WEJ intensifications show\na clear latitude dispersion with high latitudes affected first.\nWe suggest that the burstlike poleward expansions of the\nPCB are associated with burstlike enhancements in the re-\nconnection rate at the near-Earth neutral line. Reconnection\nburst energizes plasma and produces enhanced flow toward\nthe Earth. While drifting earthward, part of the plasma pop-\nulation may precipitate to the ionosphere to produce the ob-\nserved latitude-dispersed intensifications in the WEJ.\nOur results are in agreement with the study by Sergeev\net al. (2005), who used a radial configuration of several\nsatellites in the tail. They observed that at the main onset,\nthe activity propagated from a midtail reconnection region\n(XGSM<\u201316 Re) earthwards and thus was favorable to the\nNENL scenario.\nSergeev et al. (2000) suggest a model where each re-\nconnection pulse generates localized reconnected flux tubes,\nwhich contain fast flowing heated plasma. Braking of the fast\nflow at the boundary of closed flux tubes can result in further\nplasma heating and injection and an inward propagating fast\nwave. Also, the reconnection pulse itself can generate elec-\ntromagnetic wave pulses, which travel to the inner magneto-\nsphere and accelerate plasma.\nIn our event, the most intense part of the SCW is all the\ntime several degrees equatorward of the PCB. Only during\nthe latter part of the expansion phase (bursts 4 and 5), signif-\nicant westward currents flow close to the polar cap boundary.\nAfter burst 5, the current structure resembles the double oval\nconfiguration.\nIn the study by Ostgaard et al. (2005) the PCB was found\nto fluctuate at ULF frequencies (10\u201315 min periods) in the\nevening sector during substorm expansion phase. The ob-\nservations occurred obviously after the initial poleward ex-\npansion. It is plausible that the initial rapid burstlike expan-\nsions occur within a limited MLT sector with a timescale\nof 2\u201310 min, as shown in this study and those cited above.\nLater, different dynamic behaviour of the PCB motions may\nAnn.

Aikio et al.: Polar cap boundary during a substorm 1915\ntake place, depending on the magnetospheric and solar wind\ndrivers.\nIn the plasma sheet, reconnection bursts are believed to\nbe associated with observed transient, localized fast flows of\nplasma, called also bursty bulk flows (BBFs) or flow bursts,\nwhich transport magnetic flux to inner magnetosphere (An-\ngelopoulos et al., 1994). The auroral signatures of fast flows\nmay vary, but the so called auroral streamer is identified as\none possible manifestation of the fast flow. Auroral stream-\ners are finger-like, mainly north-south aligned auroral forms\n(though they may sometimes be very much tilted to the east-\nwest direction) that develop at the poleward boundary of the\nauroral oval from where they intrude equatorward with ve-\nlocities of 1\u20135 km\/s (Sergeev et al., 1999; Amm and Kau-\nristie, 2002). Substorm streamers appear typically about\n10 min after the substorm onset and they develop inside the\nsubstorm bulge.\nIn this study, an auroral structure was observed to em-\nanate from the double oval. However, the measured equa-\ntorward velocity component (400 m\/s) of the auroral struc-\nture is clearly lower than the typical velocity of streamer in-\ntrusion; the duration of the structure (about 25 min) is also\nrather long. In the absence of optical observations of this\nstructure, we suggest that the auroral form is a discrete auro-\nral arc, drifting equatorward with plasma convection. Forma-\ntion of a discrete arc close to the PCB simultaneously with a\nreconnection burst at the NENL, is an interesting observation\nand not reported before to our knowledge.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have presented a new method to be used for polar cap\nboundary determination in the nightside ionosphere by using\nthe ESR field-aligned radar measurements on Svalbard by the\n42m antenna and north-south directed low-elevation radar\nmeasurements from Svalbard (ESR 32m antenna) and\/or\nmainland Troms\u00f8 (VHF radar). The method is based on in-\ncreased electron temperature caused by precipitating parti-\ncles on closed field lines. Since the Svalbard field-aligned\nmeasurement provides the reference polar cap Te height pro-\nfile, the method can be utilised only when the PCB is lo-\ncated between Svalbard and the mainland. Comparison with\nthe Polar UVI images on 6 November 2002, showed that the\nradar-based method is generally in agreement with the PAE\n(poleward auroral emission) boundary from Polar UVI.\nThe new method to locate the PCB was applied to a sub-\nstorm event on 6 November 2002, together with the 1-D up-\nward continuation method of magnetic data from the MIR-\nACLE network to estimate the location and intensity of the\nelectrojet currents. The main results were as follows.\n\u2022 In the beginning of substorm expansion, the poleward\nboundary of the WEJ and the PCB are separated by\nabout 4\u25e6 cgmLat and substorm onset occurs well inside\nthe closed field line region.\n\u2022 If reconnection at the NENL starts during the pseudo-\nbreakup, it occurs at low rate for the first 8 min. Sub-\nstorm onset is associated with a rapid poleward expan-\nsion of the substorm current wedge, which in 3 min\nreaches the PCB, after which the PCB and SCW expand\ntogether poleward. We interpret that it takes 3 min for\nthe reconnection at the NENL to reach open field lines.\n\u2022 Substorm development is burstlike with individual\nbursts separated by 2\u201310 min. We suggest that the\nbursts are produced by the impulsive reconnection at the\nNENL.\n\u2022 Intensification of the westward electrojet in the main\noval shows latitude dispersion with high latitudes af-\nfected first after each reconnection burst. We suggest\nthat they occur as a result of reconnection bursts, which\nenergize plasma and produce enhanced flow toward the\nEarth. While drifting earthward, part of the plasma pop-\nulation precipitates to the ionosphere.\n\u2022 The burst of poleward expansion that produces the\ndouble oval configuration, is associated with a forma-\ntion of a discrete auroral structure, probably an auroral\narc, close to the PCB. The arc drifts equatorward and\nreaches finally the main oval.\nAcknowledgements. We thank G.
