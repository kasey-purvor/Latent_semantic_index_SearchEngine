OWENS in a Senior Lecturer in Operations Management in the Lincoln Business School at the University of Lincoln, United Kingdom. His research interests are knowledge transfer through distance learning, in particular in the field of logistics management. He is a Chartered Engineer and currently a member of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) logistics forum with 14 other UK universities discussing benefits of e-learning and knowledge transfer in the field of logistics. His other areas of interest are the learning issues to be understood in the design process, in particular the NPD process and new product development issues and the appreciation of having a structure technology road map incorporated into the process.
