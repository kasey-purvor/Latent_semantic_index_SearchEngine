Goehrfest, a short festival put on to mark this\noccasion, featured performances of works by both composers (and\nothers associated with the university), but for the most part, as the\nname suggests, it was Goehr\u2019s departure that generated the greater\namount of retrospective stock-taking and speculation about the\nfuture.1 Indeed, the focus on Goehr was not surprising, for in compar-\nison Hugh Wood\u2019s output and influence have to date been more\nmodest. Nevertheless, the time is long overdue for a critical (re)assess-\nment of Wood\u2019s music, which has demonstrated throughout his career\nan enduring concern with both directness of communication and the\nupholding of a core set of aesthetic and technical values.2\nCharacteristic features of Wood\u2019s mature musical language, such as\npervasive motivic working, are clearly recognizable in his earliest\npublished work, the String Quartet in B flat (1956\u20137). Nevertheless, it\nwas through encountering the music of the Second Viennese School,\nand the resulting seismic emotional shock, that Wood was able to find\nhis own voice. This discovery, and the technical and expressive break-\nthroughs that it stimulated, is demonstrated in the Variations for Viola,\nop. 1 (1957\u20138). Although almost contemporaneous with the String\nQuartet, the harmonic language of the Variations, and in particular\nthe tendency towards chromatic saturation, represents a significant\ndevelopment in Wood\u2019s career, and his own recognition of this led him\nto assign it his first opus number.\nSignificantly (and characteristically) Wood appropriated for his op. 1\nonly those aspects of the music of the Second Viennese School that he\nneeded. In particular, there are no serial workings, and only sporadic\nreferences to the serial \u2018method\u2019 can be found in later pieces. On those\noccasions when Wood has idiosyncratically drawn on serial tech-\nniques, it is in the service of the rigorous thematicism that character-\nizes his (and Schoenberg\u2019s) music. Wood has described thematicism as\nthe \u2018surest, most human form of communication\u2019, and when he writes\nmusic that might be described as serial, it is with this communicability\nin mind.3 His music therefore has no place for inaudible serial struc-\ntures: Wood\u2019s approach is empirical, practical and, in its firm\ngrounding in aural comprehensibility, humanist. Thus when Jim\nSamson states that Wood\u2019s orchestral works \u2018are among the most\n1 Since Hugh Wood\u2019s retirement, there have been two events providing mini-retrospectives of\nhis work: an early celebration of his 70th birthday at the Royal College of Music (7 March\n2002) and two study days at the University of Lancaster (29\u201330 April 2002).\n2 With the exception of dictionary entries, the most recent published study of Wood\u2019s music\ndates back to Leo Black\u2019s survey in British Music Now: A Guide to the Work of Younger\nComposers, ed. Foreman, Lewis (London: Elek, 1975), pp. 53\u201359.\n3 Wood, Hugh, \u2018Hugh Wood on his own Work\u2019, The Listener (29.10.1970), p. 605.\n4 Samson, Jim. \u2018Instrumental Music II\u2019, in The Blackwell History of Music in Britain Volume 6:\nThe Twentieth Century ed.

The tensions between these progressive\nand traditional aspects of Wood\u2019s language afford an emotional\ncontent of considerable intensity. To do it full justice, an account of\nWood\u2019s music ought to engage with this compelling blend of intellec-\ntual rigour and emotional directness. For me, it is here that the real\nessence of Wood\u2019s music can be found.\nAlexander Goehr, in his musings on a \u2018late style\u2019, noted Wood\u2019s prag-\nmatic approach in this respect, asking \u2018what then remains for the old\nartist to do? Recently, in a series of Cambridge lectures, Hugh Wood\nproposed quite simply that one should go on as before, and that seems\nmodest and sensible\u2019.5 Wood\u2019s recent compositions, from the Variations\nfor Orchestra, op. 39 (1995\u20137) through to the Cantilena and Fugue, op. 47\n(2004), exhibit this sense of \u2018going on as before\u2019, and as such bear witness\nto the emotional and intellectual qualities that characterize the best of\nhis work.6 To examine, within these pieces, those procedures that\ninform his distinctive compositional voice can therefore provide a birds-\neye view of his career to date, and pave the way for a more thorough\nconsideration of Wood\u2019s considerable artistic achievements.7\nVariations, op. 39\nThe Variations for Orchestra was commissioned by the BBC for a Far\nEastern tour by the BBC Symphony Orchestra. As with so much of his\nmusic, impetus came from Wood\u2019s familiarity with the performers and\ntheir characteristics, and this work provided him with the opportunity\nto write a sort of mini-Concerto for Orchestra. This is readily apparent\nin the way that Wood continually re-shuffles and highlights different\ngroupings and sections over the course of the work.8 Such a juggling of\nthe orchestral resources, coupled with the fact that Wood delays the\nprominence of the strings until the last two variations, points to the\ninfluence of Stravinsky. Indeed, the spirit of Stravinsky\u2019s late works in\nparticular hovers over Wood\u2019s Variations, not least in the two fugato\nvariations (V and VII). Of these, the latter is subtitled \u2018Hommage I.S.\u2019,\nand is an affectionate allusion to the fugal writing in Stravinsky\u2019s Agon.9\nReferences such as these provide clues to the general character of the\nwork, which must be counted as one of Wood\u2019s most neo-classical\nscores in recent years.\n5 Goehr, Alexander, 1999. \u2018What\u2019s left to be done\u2019, Musical Times Vol. 40, no. 1867, 19\u201328, p. 24.\n6 The op. 41 Greek Songs (to poems by Lawrence Durrell), currently incomplete, and the as-yet\nunperformed Tenebrae, op. 46, are the only works from this period not to be considered.\n7 The liberal number of references in this article to works spanning Wood\u2019s career reflects the\ncontinuities within his output; they also serve as significant points of interest within the\nbirds-eye view. Opus numbers and dates are given on the first occurrence in the text.\n8 There are significant parallels between the use of the orchestra in the Variations op. 39 and\nthat of the ensemble in Wood\u2019s earlier Chamber Concerto op. 15 (1970\u20131, rev. 1978)\n9 This is not Wood\u2019s first homage to Stravinsky involving contrapuntal procedures: for\nTempo\u2019s 1971 memorial issue to Stravinsky (Tempo 97, 1972), Wood offered a canon which, as\nhere, makes use of contrasting timbres and textures.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 3\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe work consists of an original theme and ten variations, framed\nby an Introduction and Fugue. The theme falls into two distinct halves,\nthe first of which is presented by the oboe and cor anglais, with\ncounter-melodies in the wind and horns. Within the opening bars, the\nentire chromatic set is exhausted through the use of chromatic dyads,\norganized into tetrachords (see Example One).10 This all-out chromati-\ncism is heard as part of a harmonic language which alludes, Berg-like,\nto a distant tonal background (for instance, the implied dominant of A\nat the end of the example). Against such a background, the semitone\nleanings in the individual lines and the expressive downward leaps are\nsuggestive of appoggiaturas and suspensions, imbuing them with addi-\ntional poignancy. The generally understated (and barely-repressed)\nromanticism of passages such as this, which one feels could so often\ntake flight (how telling when they do!), contributes to the often-noted\nEnglish sense of reserve that can be found in Wood\u2019s music.\n10 Early instances of composing with discrete cells that exhaust the chromatic scale can be\nfound in the second movement of his Trio for flute, viola and piano (op. 3, 1961) and, more\nimportantly, given the saturation of motifs derived from four trichord segments, in the First\nString Quartet (op. 4, 1962).\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f4\nExamples 1a and 1b\n\u00a9 Copyright 1997 Chester Music\nLimited.

Thus in the\nfirst variation (Pi\u00f9 mosso), the opening six bars preserve the pacing of\nevents (in the wind, one tetrachord every two bars), but the ordering of\npitches and, most crucially, their musical treatment, differs. The switch\nfrom 2\/2 to 8\/8 (often 3+3+2\/8) transforms the drooping melancholy\nof the theme into something more dance-like. The same restless spirit\nimbues the scurrying sul ponticello figure passed between string\nsections and, later in the variation, the ebullient rhythms of the brass.\nThe result is reminiscent of the equally vital dances that constitute the\ncentral section of Wood\u2019s magnificent Scenes from Comus, op. 6\n(1962\u20135), the progenitor of a series of wonderful orchestral scherzi to\nwhich this variation belongs.\nThe accumulated rhythmic tension of the first variation is partly\ndissipated by the second (Feroce), which functions as a downbeat to the\nfirst\u2019s extended upbeat. Here, phrases built from precipitous eight-note\nfigures alternate with melodic dyads (displaced as ninths or sevenths)\nprefacing abrasive chords. The diversity of material is reflected in the\nvaried means of its derivation. Thus the eight-note figures are\nconstructed from interlocking two tetrachords, the linear dyads are\nderived from permuting each tetrachordal cell into two pairs of whole-\ntones and the chords are vertical arrangements of the tetrachords. But\nthe listener is almost certainly going to be unaware of such technical\ndetails. Instead, their focus will be the carefully delineated contour of\nthe eight-note figure, ensuring comprehensibility amid the consider-\nable violence of the writing. The resulting intensity, both technically\nand emotionally, is characteristic of the set as a whole.\nThe invocation of recognizable musical topics provides Wood with\na further means of alluding to identifiable emotional states. In the third\nvariation (minaccioso), strings and percussion provide harmonic\nsupport in martial rhythms, punctuated by fluid wind arpeggios, over\nwhich the brass intone a cramped variation of the theme in largely\ndotted rhythms. Wood\u2019s marches are never jubilant, and this in partic-\nular is sinister and threatening. As with the first two variations, the\nthird is linked attacca into the fourth. The longest variation to this\npoint, the fourth begins as a molto pi\u00f9 mosso intensification of the\npreceding thematic material, particularly the transformation of the\nbrass theme into 12\/8. Contrasting material is provided by chorale-like\nharmonizations of four-note chromatic figures related to the tetra-\nchords (specifically, the contour of the figure is the retrograde of\nExample One, tetrachord I). Unlike variations I\u2013III, the fourth ends\nquietly, bringing the opening group of variations to a close.\nIn the fifth variation, a fugato for the brass section, the transposi-\ntional relationship between the first two tetrachords (and the tritone\ninvariance of the third) is exploited so that the answer, presented at the\ntritone, ensures chromatic and motivic saturation. Moreover, the vari-\nation embodies the rhythmic suppleness and insistence that charac-\nterise Wood\u2019s approach to the fugue, providing a source of great\nenergy and drive.11 The restricted orchestration and leaner textures of\nthe variation distinguish it from the variations that surround it, so that\nit functions as a buoyant interlude providing a clear point of articula-\ntion within the form of the work as a whole.\n11 The finale of Wood\u2019s Horn Trio op. 29 (1989) is a further example of how he uses the fugal\ntexture in this manner.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 5\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nVariation VI continues and intensifies the rhythmic impetus of the\nbrass fugato, playfully juxtaposing repeated chords (built from the\ntetrachordal cells) in groups of four staccato semiquavers with more\nlithe passages in which the semiquavers are grouped in threes and\ntwos. These juxtapositions recall, in a much more lively and direct\nmanner, the differing metrical organizations of the theme and varia-\ntion I (see above). The fleeting scherzo mood is interrupted two bars\nbefore the end by an enigmatic passage, marked lontano, in which the\nrepeated semiquavers are followed by a sustained note, before being\nbrusquely cut off by a sffz chord.\nThe mystery of this ending is not immediately explained by the\nopening of the seventh variation. The subject of the opening three-\npart fugato (violas, second violins, cellos) is once again twelve-note,\nconstructed from (at first) the three tetrachords. Unlike variation V, the\nsuccessive entries are not positioned at the tritone, but rather at suc-\ncessive downward transpositions of a tone. Complementing this\n\u2018harmonic descent\u2019 is a carefully controlled linear ascent in the second\nviolin, of which the final phrase is given in Example Two.\nIt is entirely characteristic of Wood that this dramatic, expressive and\nshapely phrase should be fashioned with such economy of means. The\nopening four-note motif of the first bar is repeated (with wider leaps)\nin the second. The three ascending crotchets x of this motif are then\ninverted and repeated three times (each time beginning on a higher\nnote). The final repetition is extended by an extra crotchet in order to\ndelay \u2013 and intensify \u2013 the arrival of the climax of the phrase on the B.\nThe directness of expression artfully conceals a sophisticated treat-\nment of the source tetrachords (see the small stave below Ex. 2).\nWhereas the fifth variation made virtue of the tritone relationships\nbetween and within the tetrachords, here the emphasis is on their chro-\nmatic nature. Thus the four-note figure of the first bar is an elegant\ncomposing out of tetrachord II, arranged so that the pitch classes form a\ndescending chromatic segment. The second bar is an inversion around\nthe Eb and D. The resulting appearance of an E and the F \u2018demand\u2019 the\nuse of Bb and B in order to complete tetrachord III, but while these notes\nform the penultimate and final melodic goals of the phrase, they are\ndelayed by notes from tetrachord I. These insertions generate three- or\nfour-note groups constructed from alternate descending or ascending\nchromatic segments, forming a surface parallel with the motivic inver-\nsion that occurs midway through the extract.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f6\nExample 2\n\u00a9 Copyright 1997 Chester Music\nLimited.

Such bold \u2013 Stravinskian \u2013 juxtapositions are crucial to\nWood\u2019s language: what impresses most is the controlled means by\nwhich he uses this effect to build larger structures. Thus the fanfare is\nused to frame and divide two lyrical (and imitative) wind episodes that\nlook ahead to variation VIII. But one is not allowed to dwell on these\nepisodes, for the fugato returns in five parts and inverted, as an\nextended close to the seventh variation. As with Ex. 2, the fugato is cut\noff at its climax by a fanfare, which here closes the variation.\nNevertheless, by following it with the tiny variation VIII, eight bars of\nfugitive arpeggios orchestrated for wind and cymbals alone, Wood\nmakes an allusion to \u2013 or a development of \u2013 the central section of\nvariation VII. The result is a blurring of the boundaries between varia-\ntions: all is transitory, in flux.\nThe formal instability and uncertainty of variations VI\u2013VIII\nprepare, by way of contrast, the expansive lyricism of variations XI and\nX. Characterized by their generosity of spirit as well as their duration,\nthese final two variations together constitute the emotional core of the\nwork. The harmony of both of these variations makes frequent use of\nsonorities based on seventh chords, which, coupled with the predomi-\nnant string tone, signifies a change of mood. Of particular note is the\ntune for the cellos that forms the tenth variation, in which Wood\u2019s\nromantic impulse is finally, unreservedly, unleashed.\nThe fugue follows straight on from the final variation, with the\nscoring at first continuing to emphasize the strings, with wind and brass\nadding weight to entries. The opening subject demonstrates the\nrhythmic suppleness of much of Wood\u2019s writing, the inherent energy of\nthe lines coming from a further permutation of the tetrachords, making\nuse of wide expressive leaps that mark Wood at his most insistent. In all,\nthere are four complete entries, at symmetrically strategic transposition\nlevels (the entries are, in turn, at P0, P6, P3 and P9), followed by a short\n\u2018codetta\u2019 focusing on the original transposition and that at the tritone.\nAfter this \u2018exposition\u2019, there follows a sort of jazzy brass chorale, super-\nimposed over further fugal entries (on P9, P0 and P6) in the strings.\nHowever, these entries are now restricted to the first six notes of the\nsubject: indeed the full fugal theme does not recur in the work. Yet\nmotivic fragments from both subject and counter-subject continue to be\nheard and elaborated in free counterpoint \u2013 or, following the brass\nchorale, in pre-cadential wind and brass gestures that precede the coda.\nThe coda draws together the various gestures of the fugue, and ends\nwith a reference to the opening flourish of the Introduction.\nBy ending the Variations with material \u2013 at the original pitch \u2013 from\nthe opening, Wood is making use of a formal gesture that appears in\nmuch of his music. On a larger scale, the various groupings that emerge\nin op. 39 \u2013 such as the macrorhythmic \u2018up-beat\u2019 and \u2018down-beat\u2019 effect\nwithin the first four variations, the interpenetrations of the middle vari-\nations and the shared emotional world of the final variations \u2013 suggest\ninnovative solutions to formal problems that go beyond, but are inti-\nmately concerned with, surface events. Such compositional responses\nare reflections of Wood\u2019s enduring concern to balance the demands of\nlocal detail within the global architecture of a work, a concern that typi-\ncally results, as here, in coherent end-weighted structures that are both\nintellectually and emotionally satisfying.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 7\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nClarinet Trio, op.40\nWood\u2019s preference for chamber music genres (represented above all by\nhis string quartets) has typically resulted in works in which the emphasis\nis placed on the musical structure, and on the contrapuntal working-out\nof the material. Accordingly, neither (explicit) extra-musical titles and\nprogrammes nor musical portraiture are commonly found in his oeuvre.\nNevertheless, one frequently finds that the qualities and virtues of the\nplayers that Wood is writing for, or particular biographical details, are\nboth reflected in and integrated into the music. So it is with all three\nmovements of the Clarinet Trio, op. 40 (1997), which was commis-\nsioned and premi\u00e8red by the Trio Gemelli. Wood notes in the score that\nthe opening movement \u2018concentrates on the members of the trio as solo\ninstrumentalists\u2019.12 In addition to the character of the material, the\nplayers seem to have inspired the musical procedures and structures that\nshape the movement. Although the nature of the extended canonic\nwriting, internal symmetries and interaction between the two melody\ninstruments is firmly rooted within Wood\u2019s style, the particularly\nintense manner in which it is realized mirrors the fact that the original\nplayers ( John and Adrian Bradbury) are identical twins.13\nThe first movement opens with a lyrical 12-note melody in the cello\n(followed in canon by the clarinet a bar later and a tritone higher:\nExample Three).\n12 This, and subsequent quotes relating to the Clarinet Trio, were taken from the composer\u2019s\nnote in the score. A recording of the Clarinet Trio by the Trio Gemelli has been released on\nCD (Divine Art 25009).\n13 Mirrored in, but not predicated by.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f8\nExample 3\n\u00a9 Copyright 2000 Chester Music\nLimited.

The opening augmented triad is thus re-ordered in bars 4\u20135\n(to become C\u2013E\u2013G#), with the climactic G#\u2013A figure referring back\nto the same appoggiatura-like motivic shape in bars 2 and 3. (The use\nhere of serial operations on melodic fragments to generate further\nmotivic material recalls Ex. 2.) A distant D major\/minor tonal back-\nground is suggested by the first piano chord, and is intensified by the\ndescent to the dominant in the bass (the opening chord returns as the\nfinal chord of the movement). Against this first chord, the clarinet\nentry can be heard as an elaborated D major triad, and the C#\u2013D in the\ncello as a poignant appoggiatura (compare with Ex. 1). Yet it is entirely\ncharacteristic that such moments are as elusive as they are allusive: the\nshifting harmonic contexts in which these linear materials are\npresented ensure that their meaning is never stable.\nThe canonic introduction to the movement is mirrored by a coda.\nTogether, these canonic passages frame the main discourse, which\nconsists of two extended solos, the first for clarinet, the second for\ncello, each of which is followed by a duet between the two. In the\nmiddle of all of this is a section for solo piano. In general, the pitch\norganization eschews the tight motivic development of short row frag-\nments (as in the Variations) for a greater emphasis on longer lyrical\nspans. The main melody on which the central section is based is given\nin Example Four.\nThe line is derived (unusually, for Wood) from the retrograde of the\nopening twelve-note canon (Ex. 3), rotated so as to begin on D. The\ndyad D\u2013C# thus forms the head of the melodic line, and it is brought\nback at the end of the first phrase to close it. In the third phrase, Wood\nuses RI3 (similarly rotated) so that this dyad is reversed; the final\ncadence is extended to initiate a duet with the cello. Although predi-\ncated on serial operations, the aural emphasis is on the leading note-\ntonic relationship implied by the semitone dyad, providing further\nallusion to the background \u2018tonic\u2019 D. Another noteworthy correspon-\ndence between the two phrases resulting from this particular choice of\nrow is that the dotted crotchets in bars 26 and 27, which are given\nemphasis by the quaver motion leading into them, are answered in bars\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 9\nExample 4 \n\u00a9 Copyright 2000 Chester Music\nLimited.

Such relationships, which can often\nbe found in Wood\u2019s music, are indicative of underlying structures,\nthough the precise nature of these structures is rather more difficult to\ndetermine. Nevertheless, Wood is far more concerned with aural prop-\nerties of his material, with their musical significance, than with\nabstract theoretical notions. This concern, a sine qua non for Wood\u2019s\nmusic, ensures that it communicates with a rare directness, for those\nthat are prepared to listen.\nSuch a concern can be detected, for example, when the contrasting\nmiddle section to this melody (bars 32\u201334) abandons complete lyrical\nstatements of the 12-note line for a rapid succession of motivic frag-\nments. Whilst there exists an oblique relation to serial procedures,\nWood\u2019s emphasis is on melody, rather than row, which stems from the\nsame concerns that motivated the pre-serial Webern to cross out each\nnote of the chromatic scale as he went along, without repetition. In other\nwords, Wood\u2019s employment of certain serial operations results from an\naesthetic, not technical decision. His practice of using 12-note melodies\nreferentially, at specific transpositional levels (usually the original) as a\nmeans to articulate structure, belongs to the same set of concerns.\nWood describes the middle movement as a scherzo-march. There is\ncertainly a processional element to it, for within the first couple of\npages, five different \u2018characters of material\u2019 swiftly pass by, \u2018at first to\nbe identified with particular instruments\u2019. A more lyrical sixth char-\nacter is soon added (b. 17). The playful way in which these jostle with\none another marks Wood at his most impish: at one point (b. 71), the\npianist is instructed to play \u2018like Chico\u2019!14 Despite the fluid shifting\nbetween blocks, not to mention the continued development of the\nideas (as they pass between instruments), a loose ternary structure can\nbe detected. The middle section takes the lyrical sixth character as a\nbasis for another canon between cello and clarinet: one wonders again\nthe degree to which the personal qualities of the Trio Gemelli have\nshaped the movement. Whatever the specific impetus might be, the\nyouthful vigour of the writing is recognizably Wood\u2019s, and can be\nfound much of his music.\nThe lively interplay of different characters and general high spirits of\nthe scherzo is starkly juxtaposed with the slow elegiac mourning of the\nfinale, which pursues its emotional topic with remarkable intensity.15 A\nsonorous passage concentrated in the lower registers of the instru-\nments and rich in (vertical) thirds and fifths opens the movement. These\never-shifting harmonies result from the interaction of polyphonic lines\nbuilt from short fragments consisting of chromatic clusters; the\nresulting tension between the melodic chromaticism and warm\nharmonies is deeply expressive. The subsequent section is projected\nagainst the background of a funeral march. This background is some-\ntimes explicit, such as with the \u2018funeral drum-beat on the piano\u2019 that\naccompanies two extended solos, first for cello (b. 15), then for clarinet\n(b. 45). More often, though, it is indirectly alluded to through the use of\nstark textures and a continued focus on the instruments\u2019 lower registers.\nA respite is found in the warmer, cantabile pi\u00f9 mosso section, in which\nthe melodic chromatic clusters open out with seemingly effortless lyri-\ncism. Wood describes this as \u2018the climax of the movement\u2019, but the\nreferences to the first movement (amongst others, the prominent use\n14 Chico Marx, that is.\n15 The use of two slower movements to flank a central faster one is unique in Wood\u2019s output,\nalthough slow valedictory final movements can be found in a number of his works in a vari-\nety of genres.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f10\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 08 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nof augmented triads and canonic writing) suggest that it is also the\nclimax of the entire work. Yet the respite is short-lived: the return of\nthe \u2018drum-beat\u2019 signals the start of a drastically compressed recollec-\ntion of material, in which the extended cello and clarinet solos are\nreduced to just three notes each. A longer version of the opening poly-\nphonic passage concludes the movement; against the background of\nthe funeral march, the chromaticism is imbued with a greater sense of\nloss, concluding one of Wood\u2019s most affecting tributes.16 Neverthess,\nthe extramusical factors that give rise to various musical procedures,\ncharacters and genres in the Clarinet Trio are ultimately of biograph-\nical, not musical, significance. Through his response to such stimuli,\nwe might learn something of Wood as man and musician, but nothing\nof the music itself.\nSerenade and Elegy, op.42\nThe Serenade and Elegy for string quartet and string orchestra (1999)\nwas written in memory of Wood\u2019s daughter. The basic pitch material\nof the first movement (Serenade) is given in Example Five:\nAs with the Variations for Orchestra, the parsing of the chromatic scale\ninto a number of smaller cells provides Wood with a variety of\nmelodic and harmonic combinations. At the same time, however, he\nemphasizes the linear qualities of his material, so that the first eight\nnotes in particular function as a \u2018motto theme\u2019 for the movement as a\nwhole. This motto \u2013 which opens the work \u2013 is a quotation from\nKurt\u00e1g\u2019s J\u00e1t\u00e9kok, bearing the words \u2018Vir\u00e1g, vir\u00e1g az ember\u2019 (\u2018Flowers\nwe are flowers\u2019), both words and music pointing to the character of the\nwork as a whole. Wood gives this motto to the solo violin: the\nremaining four notes of the chromatic scale (cells E and F) are intro-\nduced in the opening notes of a two-part dialogue that follows in the\norchestral violins. A second dialogue follows in the lower strings,\npresenting the motto theme once again, now integrated into the\nprevailing 6\/8 of the serenade.\nAlthough the motto theme remains recognizable in all of its appear-\nances in the movement, there is greater variety of contrasting material\nbased on the remaining cells. Thus the two orchestral dialogues\nmentioned above are interrupted by a chord in the solo quartet built\nfrom cells E and F, in contrast to their previous linear appearance. A\nsimilar thing happens at figure 2, when the quartet interrupts with a\nnew 12-note idea, derived from vertical rearrangements of the original\ndyads (see Example Six; the letters under the first system refer to the\ndyads in Ex. 5). As with many of Wood\u2019s themes, the opening is 12-\nnote, with the continuation a free development of this material. This\nnew idea remains dormant for the rest of the movement (to return in\nthe next) but the blocks involving the quartet, juxtaposed with sere-\nnade-like ideas in the orchestra, retain the elegiac mood. Nevertheless,\nthe intrusions into the serenade atmosphere cast a shadow over the\nfirst movement; a shadow that deepens into the second.\n16 The finale was written as a memorial tribute to a friend of the composer\u2019s who died in 1997.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 11\nExample 5\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 Chester Music\nLimited.

For the first\nmovement, the most important are the two main serenade ideas which\nderive ultimately from the orchestral two-part dialogues at the start; it\nis to the orchestra that the first extended section, and climax, is\nentrusted (figures 5\u20137). The solo quartet emerges from this climax\n(over a chord containing three of the four combined pitches of cells E\nand F) with \u2018concerto-like\u2019 entrances, lead to a stylized birdsong\npassage.17 This passage \u2013 and its subsequent return at figure 16 \u2013\nframes a central section in which quartet and orchestra, individually\nand together, develop the serenade themes. The heightened lyrical\nexpression of the central section is accompanied, as so often in the\nmore romantic vein of Wood\u2019s music, with rich chords derived from\ntriads and seventh chords. The movement concludes with a\ncompressed section that ends with a recollection of the opening motif;\nanother instance of Wood using pitch and theme to articulate form.\nThe expansive Elegy that concludes the work, belonging to a distin-\nguished line of weighty Adagios in Wood\u2019s output, is something of an\noddity, both formally and thematically. It consists of three independent\nsections that are loosely connected by a shared E\u2013D dyad, but more\nclosely by a shared emotional world. The first of these sections\ncontinues the constant development of the first movement\u2019s primary\nmaterial to provide its harmonic resources; the melodic material\nchiefly comes from the elegiac theme quoted above in Ex. 6 above.\nAfter an orchestral introduction, the emphasis is firmly on the string\nquartet, which at figure 2 begins to engage in a series of tightly-\nwrought imitative duet pairings. By figure 5, this becomes four-part\ncounterpoint, alternating with orchestral passages based on six-part\nchords derived from free combinations of the dyads in Ex. 5.\nUnderneath increasingly elaborate writing in the quartet, the\nharmonic argument presented in the orchestra intensifies, reaching the\n17 Stylized birdsong is something of a rarity in Wood\u2019s output; his Third String Quartet, op. 20\n(1978) features the other prominent example of this device.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f12\nExample 6\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003 Chester Music\nLimited.

At this point, the E\u2013D dyad\nfirst appears, as the top voice in pesante complementary chords (the\nfirst built from cells A\u2013C, the second D\u2013F). Further repetitions of the\nE\u2013D dyad are harmonized by increasingly thin and softly scored\nchords, until only a gently oscillating E\u2013D in the solo violin remains,\nacting as a transition to the second section. Although the importance\nof the E\u2013D dyad is unclear at this stage, its arrival coincides with the\nlast use (for now) of material based on the dyads of Ex. 5.\nThe departure from the primary pitch material of the work as the\nbasis of the second section in the Elegy is unexpected, when compared\nwith the use of cells in the Variations op. 39, the 12-note melody of the\nfirst movement of the Clarinet Trio, or even the practice of the\nSerenade. (The stylized birdsong in the first movement, whilst not\nderived from the primary material, provides only local contrast.) The\ntune on which the second section is based \u2013 \u2018very much in slow move-\nment character\u201918 \u2013 was first heard in the duet pairings at figure 2. This\ntune, like the Elegy theme (Ex. 6) with which it has motivic connex-\nions, was originally accompanied by chords derived from the primary\nmaterial, but it is otherwise independent of this material. This proce-\ndure establishes, within the boundaries of Wood\u2019s style, large-scale\nexpectations of the return of the primary material in some form.\nThe E\u2013D dyad crucial in the transition between first and section\nsections returns in the string quartet at the start of the third section, a\n\u2018virtual transcription\u2019 of Pfitzner\u2019s setting of Eichendorff \u2019s \u2018Zum\nAbschied meiner Tochter\u2019. Both the subject of the poem, in which \u2018a\nfather is bidding farewell to his departing daughter\u2019, and its original\nsetting prompted Wood to state that these \u2018expressed what I wanted so\nvery much better than anything I could write\u2019.19 To this there is a final\nheart-rending stroke, in which Wood layers over the transcription\nrecollections of the pitch material, and particularly the motto theme,\nfrom the first movement (see, for example, the solo orchestral violin\ntwo bars before figure 29). Against the C major of Pfitzner\u2019s setting,\nthe chromaticism of the motto assumes an achingly poignant bitter-\nsweet quality, before it is eventually absorbed once again into pure\ndiatonicism. Nevertheless, the recall of this material fulfils the \u2018tonal\u2019\nexpectations established by the second section, and provides coherence\nacross the work as a whole.\nBy bringing together allusions to the motto theme with the delicate\nPfitzner transcription, Wood highlights the different functions of the\nquotations. Although both have deep personal resonance, the motto\ntheme from Kurt\u00e1g is used as a means of generating further material,\nwhereas the Pfitzner is used for \u2018conclusive emotional reference\u2019.20\nBoth types of quotations can be found throughout Wood\u2019s career:\nwitness, say, the emergence of the jazz standard \u2018Sweet Lorraine\u2019 in the\nsecond movement of the Piano Concerto, op. 32 (1990\u20131) or the\nprogrammatic \u2013 and deeply affecting \u2013 quotations from Wagner and\nMozart in the Symphony, op. 21 (1974\u201382). In all cases, Wood\u2019s use of\nborrowed material is far removed from the ironic detachment of\ncertain postmodern composers. Rather, it serves a direct communica-\ntive purpose, intensifying and casting new light on the existing musical\nand emotional argument provided by Wood\u2019s own music.\n(to be concluded)\n18 Composer\u2019s note to the score.\n19 Ibid.\n20 Ibid.\n\uf773\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf761\uf764\uf765\uf773 \uf761\uf76e\uf764 \uf765\uf76c\uf765\uf767\uf769\uf765\uf773: \uf774\uf768\uf765 \uf772\uf765\uf763\uf765\uf76e\uf774 \uf76d\uf775\uf773\uf769\uf763 \uf76f\uf766 \uf768\uf775\uf767\uf768 \uf777\uf76f\uf76f\uf764 13\n"}
