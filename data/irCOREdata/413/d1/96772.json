A\nparticularly fruitful approach to the study of many\nmorphogenetic processes is based on the hypothesis that\nthey are regulated by physiological constraints that\noptimize function (LaBarbera, 1990). Several such princi-\nples have been proposed to explain the structure of the\nvascular system (Zamir, 1976), although the one which has\nreceived most attention from experimentalists and theoret-\nicians is Murray\u2019s design principle. Murray used optimi-\nzation arguments to develop laws governing branching in\nvascular trees (Murray, 1926). He proposed that the\nmorphology of the vascular system should be determined\nby a process which minimizes the energy required to\nmaintain the volume of blood and to drive the blood flow.\nWhile hydrodynamical resistance decreases as the diameter0026-2862\/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Alarco\u00b4n).of the vessel increases, more metabolic energy is required\nto sustain a larger volume of blood. The final geometry\nrepresents a balance between these competing effects, with\nlumen radius being proportional to the cubic root of the\nflow rate (Murray\u2019s law). Although the present article\nfocuses on an optimization design principle, organization\nprinciples based on different assumptions can be formu-\nlated. For example, Gafiychuk and Lubashevsky (2001)\nshowed Murray\u2019s law can be derived from a geometric\nargument, namely, that the vascular system has to be a\nspace filling structure.\nMurray\u2019s law has been tested extensively and appears\nto be valid in large arteries and arterioles (LaBarbera,\n1990; Zamir, 1977). However, it does not provide a good\ndescription of the microcirculation (Frame and Sarelius,\n1995; Pries et al., 1995). Zamir (1977) showed that\nMurray\u2019s design principle leads to a branching structure in\nwhich the wall shear stress (WSS) is constant. While the\nWSS is approximately constant in large arterial vessels,\nrecent work by Pries et al. (1995) shows that it depends\non the pressure inside the vessel: the WSS depends on\nthe transmural pressure in a sigmoidal manner, saturating69 (2005) 156 \u2013 172\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 157to a constant value for large pressures (i.e., large arteries\nand arterioles), as predicted by Murray\u2019s law.\nIn this paper, we develop a new design principle that\ncan reproduce generic features of real vascular networks\nsuch as those reported in Pries et al. (1995). Taber (1998)\nhas proposed a similar approach. His analysis is based\nupon the hypothesis that vasomotor control of blood flow\nrequires a significant amount of the energy used to run\nthe circulatory system. Accordingly, he modifies Murray\u2019s\nlaw to include energy costs associated with maintaining\nsmooth-muscle contraction against the distending effects\nof the wall stress, which in turn depends on pressure and\nvessel geometry. The corresponding design principle\nyields a non-monotonic dependence of the WSS upon\nthe pressure. There are two main differences between\nTaber\u2019s approach and that presented here. First, we\nneglect the energy costs associated with smooth-muscle\nmaintenance, but we take into account other factors such\nas blood rheology. Second, whereas Taber (1998) deals\nwith the behavior of a single vessel when the pressure is\nmodified, we build a network according to our design\nprinciple and analyze the behavior of the WSS across the\nnetwork. Hence, our approach is more closely related to\nthe experimental procedure of Pries et al. (1995). Our\ndesign principle produces a new (local) law relating the\nlumen radius at branch points that provide a more\nrealistic description of vascular trees than that obtained\nfrom Murray\u2019s law; this issue is not addressed in Taber\n(1998).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Materials and\nmethods, we present our mathematical model and all the\nelements we use to analyze it and to interpret our results.\nResults is devoted to a description of our results. In the\nConclusions section, our conclusions are presented.Materials and methods\nIn this section, we use a design principle as our basic\nmathematical model to explain a number of properties of the\nvascular system such as those observed by Pries et al. (1995).\nWe begin with a brief description of Murray\u2019s law. We then\nshow how it may be modified in order to obtain more\nrealistic results. We claim that this can be accomplished byFig. 1. Schematic diagram of a bifurcation. Hp, Pp, Q\u02d9p, and v0 are the hematocrit, p\nvi, i = 1, 2, are the hematocrit, pressure, flow rate, and flow velocity in each one o\nthe direction in which the (local) pressure acts on the RBC.including in the design principle key characteristics of blood\nflow and vessel behavior, namely, complex blood rheology.\nMathematical model: design principle\nMurray\u2019s law\nAs stated above, Murray\u2019s law establishes that the\nvascular tree is organized so that a balance exists between\nthe metabolic energy of a given volume of blood and the\nenergy required for blood flow. Specifically, it is based on a\nminimization principle for the dissipated power W. The flow\nis assumed to be Poiseuille, the vessels are considered rigid\ntubes and the pressure gradient is assumed to be constant.\nThe blood is viewed as a Newtonian fluid of constant\nviscosity. These assumptions lead to the following formula-\ntion of the design principle for a single vessel of length L and\nradius R:\nBW\nBR\n\u00bc 0;\nW \u00bc WH \u00feWM;\nWH \u00bc 8Q\u02d9\n2l0L\npR4\n;\nWM \u00bc abpR2L: \u00f01\u00de\nIn Eq. (1), WH is the power dissipated by the flow (Fung,\n1993), WM is the metabolic energy consumption rate of the\nblood, Q\u02d9 is the flow rate, l0 is the blood viscosity, and ab is\nthe metabolic rate per unit volume of blood. Using Eq. (1),\nwe deduce that the total dissipated power W is minimized if\nQ\u02d9 \u00bc pR\n3\n4\nffiffiffiffiffi\nab\nl0\nr\n: \u00f02\u00de\nEq. (2) shows how the vessel radius R and the flow rate Q\u02d9\nare related when the optimization principle is satisfied.\nAdditionally, at a bifurcation in the vascular tree, such as the\none depicted in Fig. 1, conservation of mass implies\nQ\u02d9p \u00bc Q\u02d91 \u00fe Q\u02d92; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Q\u02d9p is the flow rate through the parent vessel. Taken\ntogether, Eqs. (2) and (3) imply that, at a bifurcation, theressure, flow rate, and flow velocity in the parent vessel, and Hi, Pi, Q\u02d9i, and\nf the daughter branches. RBC stands for red blood cell. The arrows indicate\nFig. 2. Graph showing how the relative viscosity lrel varies with the vessel\nradius R for fixed values of the hematocrit H (see Eq. (6)).\nT.

Using the above result, it is easy to\ndetermine theWSSwithin a given vessel. For Poiseuille flow,\nthe WSS is given by\nsw \u00bc 4l0Q\u02d9pR3 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nabl0\np\n; \u00f05\u00de\nusing Eq. (2).Thus, we conclude that the WSS is constant\nthroughout vascular networks constructed according to\nMurray\u2019s principle (Zamir, 1977).\nEffects of blood rheology\nMurray\u2019s law neglects certain factors, such as rheology,\nwhich may play an important role in the organization of the\nvascular tree (Fung, 1993; Pries et al., 1994). Blood is far from\nbeing a simple fluid with constant viscosity: it is a very\ncomplex suspension of cells and molecules of a wide range of\nsizes. Consequently, treating blood as a Newtonian fluid is a\nvery crude approximation. Fortunately, there are experimental\nresults which provide justification for neglecting many of\nthese features, enabling us to focus on the key role played by\nred blood cells in blood rheology. As shown in Fig. 2, the\nrelative (non-dimensional) blood viscosity, lrel (R, H),\ndepends on R and also on the hematocrit H, which is defined\nas the ratio between the total blood volume and the volume\noccupied by red blood cells. The relative viscosity exhibits a\nnon-monotonic dependence on R which can be sub-divided\ninto threedifferent regions. IfR ismuchgreater than the typical\nsize of a red blood cell1, then the viscosity is independent of\nthe vessel radius. As the radius of the vessel decreases, the\nviscosity also decreases (the Fahraeus\u2013Lindqvist effect)\nuntil the viscosity attains a minimum value R \u00a8 25 Am. For\nsmaller values of R, the viscosity increases as R decreases\n(Pries et al., 1994). The dependence on the hematocrit is\neasier to understand: the higher is the hematocrit, the thicker\nthe blood becomes, and therefore its viscosity increases.\nIn this paper, we take l(R, H) = l0lrel (R, H), where l0 is\nthe viscosity of plasma and lrel is the (non-dimensional)\nrelative viscosity. In particular, we follow Pries et al.

(7), l0 is the viscosity of plasma and lrel (R, H) is\ngiven by Eq. (6). Substituting from Eq. (6) into Eq. (7), we\ndeduce that the optimization principle predicts that Q\u02d9 and R\nare related as follows:\nQ\u02d9 \u00bc R3 p\n2l1=20\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nab\n4lrel \u0007 RBlrel=BR\nr\n: \u00f08\u00de\nAs a first approximation, we assume that H is fixed in\nEq. (6) and consider the corresponding results with a radius-\ndependent viscosity only. In particular, we have set H =\n0.45. This particular value has been chosen because in Pries\net al. (1994), H = 0.45 is set as a \u2018\u2018reference value \u2019\u2019in the\nfitting procedure to obtain Eq. (6). In this case, when we\nsolve Eq. (8) numerically and plot the results on a log\u2013log\nscale (see Fig. 3), we observe three different behaviors. For\nlarge flow rates, Q\u02d9 \u00a8 R3.00, for intermediate values Q\u02d9 \u00a8\nR2.87, whereas for small flow rates Q\u02d9\u00a8 R3.66. The regions in\nwhich the data may be described by power laws are\nseparated by cross-over regions where R \u00a8 Rcr1 (Q\u02d9 \u00a8\nQ\u02d9cr1) and R \u00a8 Rcr2 (Q \u00a8 Q\u02d9cr2). In these transition regions,\nthe power law fails to describe the data.\nFig. 3. Dependence of the flow rate (Q\u02d9) on the radius (R) in an optimal\nnetwork (see Eq. (8)).

Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 159Using Eq. (8) and mass conservation, we can derive a re-\nlationship between vessel radii at bifurcation points, as Q\u02d9 =\nCRa in each one of the regions mentioned in the previous\nparagraph.

A similar relationship can be obtained in the present\ncase. Indeed, as R \u00a8 Q\u02d91\/a, Eq. (9) also applies in the present\ncase but the exponents ai and the coefficients Ci depend on\nthe radius of the vessel in the following manner:\nai \u00bc\n3:00 if R1 > Rcr1;\n2:87 if Rcr2 V Ri V Rcr1;\n3:66 if Ri < Rcr2;\n8<\n: \u00f010\u00deand\nCi \u00bc\n2:65 if R1 > Rcr1;\n7:53 if Rcr2 V Ri V Rcr1;\n0:41 if Ri < Rcr2;\n8<\n: \u00f011\u00de\nwhere Rcr1 \u02da 270 lm and Rcr2 \u02da 45 lm.\nThe values of the coefficients ai and Ci were calculated\nfor the particular values of the experimentally determined\nparameters stated in Table 1 and Eq. (6). A discussion of\nhow sensitive our results are to changes in parameters is\ngiven in link: Qualitative analysis from model viscosities.\nTaken together, Eq. (9) shows that we recover Murray\u2019s\nresult for large vessels with a large flow rate. However, the\nbehavior is different in smaller vessels.\nQualitative analysis from model viscosities\nThe previous section was based on experimental data\nfor the viscosity and, in particular, an expression relating\nthe viscosity to the vessel radius and the hematocrit\nobtained by Pries et al. (1995). The complexity of Eq.\n(6) renders analytical progress extremely difficult. There-\nfore, in this section, we incorporate the generic features of\nblood viscosity into simpler expressions which we use to\ngain a deeper understanding of our results and to identify\nconditions under which they are relevant. We also inves-\ntigate those properties of viscosity which, when incorpo-\nrated into the design principle, give rise to experimentally\nobserved behavior and, in particular, the sigmoidal depend-\nence of the WSS on the transmural pressure.\nOne of the simplest model (relative) viscosities one\ncan imagine is the piece-wise approximation (see Fig. 4),\nlrel R;H\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nlsat H\u00f0 \u00de RminRsat\n\u000e \u000fc H\u00f0 \u00de\nR\nRmin\n\u000e \u000f\u0007b H\u00f0 \u00de\nif RV Rmin;\nlsat H\u00f0 \u00de RRsat\n\u000e \u000fc H\u00f0 \u00de\nif Rmin V RV Rsat;\nlsat H\u00f0 \u00de if R \b Rmin\n8>><\n>>:\n\u00f012\u00de\nThe physical meanings of the different parameters\nappearing in Eq.

(13) and (15) the condition c < 4\nhas to be satisfied.\nSimulations\nIn order to determine whether our design principle\naccounts for the experimental results of Pries et al. (1995),\nwe carried out numerical simulations for simple branching\nnetworks such as the one shown in Fig. 5, its morphology\nbeing determined by the optimization principle discussed in\nthe preceding section.The system under investigation is a branching network of\nvessels. We assume that at each generation all vessels are\nidentical and that their number increases by a factor 2, i.e., the\nnumber of vessels,Nk + 1, in the (k +1)th generation isNk + 1 =\n2Nk, where Nk is the number of vessels in generation k. Their\nlengths are set according to Lk + 1 = qLk with q \t 1 (West et\nal., 1997) and their radii are given by Eq. (9)2.\nAs we are assuming that the flow in each vessel is\nincompressible, the flow pattern in this network satisfies\nKirchoff\u2019s laws, i.e., flow conservation at each bifurcation\npoint,\nQ\u02d9i \u00bc Q\u02d9j \u00fe Q\u02d9k ; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere j and k denote vessels branching from vessel i, and\nconservation of energyX\nj\nDPj \u00bc DPT: \u00f017\u00de\nIn Eq. (17), DPT is the pressure drop across the whole\nnetwork, DPj is the pressure drop across vessel j, and the\nsum is over the vessels in a continuous path connecting the\nends of the network (see Fig. 5). Additionally, we assume\nPoiseuille flow in each vessel, so that\nDPj \u00bc ZjQ\u02d9j; \u00f018\u00de\nwhere Zj = 8l0l rel (Rj, HJ) Lj\/pR\n4\nj .\nEqs. (16)\u2013(18) fully determine the flow rate in all the\nvessels of the network, provided we know their radii and\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 161lengths. In Appendix A, we explain how the geometry of the\nvessels can be determined according to the restrictions\nimposed by our optimization principle. In broad terms, we\nuse Eqs. (16) and (17) to obtain the flow rate in each vessel\nand Eq. (18) to determine the pressure drop across each\nvessel of the network. This enables us to calculate the\npressure3 in any vessel belonging to generation k as\nPk \u00bc PH \u0007\nXk \u0007 1\ni \u00bc 1\nDPi \u0007 DP\nk\n2\n; \u00f019\u00de\nwhere PH is the pressure at the inlet point of the network.\nFurther, given the radii and flow rates in each vessel, we can\nuse Eq. (5) to calculate the WSS. Eqs. (18) and (19) provide\na relation between pressure and radius. Since there is a one-\nto-one correspondence between a vessel\u2019s generation and its\nradius, we can use this relation to plot the WSS as a function\nof the pressure.\nAnother factor that needs to be accounted for is\nhematocrit distribution at bifurcations. According to Fung\n(1993), the simplest way to proceed is to assume that the\ndistribution of hematocrit depends on the flow velocity of\nthe daughter vessels. Roughly speaking, a larger proportion\nof the hematocrit from the parent vessel, Hp, is transported\nalong the faster branch (see Fig. 1):\nHp \u00bc H1 \u00fe H2\nH1\nH2\n\u00bc v1\nv2\n; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere vi = Q\u02d9i\/pR\n2\ni (i = 1, 2). Eq. (20) is a simplification of\nthe expression given by Fung (1984) in order to simplify the\nalgebraic manipulation, althxough in the case of networks in\nwhich all the bifurcations are symmetrical, which is\nanalyzed in detail in Results, this may not yield totally\nrealistic results (for example, hematocrit values are very\nsmall after a large number of bifurcations).\nTo verify our procedure, we solved Kirchoff\u2019s laws for a\nnetwork constructed according to Murray\u2019s law, i.e., ai = 3,\ni = 1, 2, 3. We found that Q\u02d9 \u00a8 R3 and sw was constant, as\nexpected.Results\nSymmetrically branching network with uniform hematocrit\nIn Appendix A, we show that a branching network, in\nwhich all vessels in the same generation are identical, satisfies\nthe restrictions imposed by our design principle. Hereafter\nsuch a network is referred to as a symmetrically branching3 We compute the pressure at the mid-point of the vessel. As we are\nassuming that the vessels are rigid, the pressure at a point x along the axis of\nthe vessel is simply given by P(x) = PH \u0007 (DP\/L)x. We will assume that all\nthe vessels in a given generation are identical and therefore the\ncorresponding pressures are also identical.network. Our aim in this section is to test our model in the\nsimple situation when variation in hematocrit is not taken into\naccount, so that blood viscosity depends on the radius in the\nnon-monotonical way shown in Fig. 4 but is independent of\nthe hematocrit. For the simulations discussed in this section,\nwe take l(R) K l0l rel (R, H = 0.45).\nInitially, we present results for a symmetrically branching\nnetwork. As shown in Appendix A, this network is not\nunique. Due to the non-monotonic dependence of the\nviscosity upon the radius, we can construct asymmetrically\nbranching networks. Hence, although the results we discuss\nin this section are obtained for a simple case, our model is\nalso able to produce heterogeneous structures. Such\nbehavior is consistent with experimental results that indicate\nthat no two vascular trees are identical. This point will be\ndiscussed further in The role of hematocrit: asymmetric\nbifurcations.\nWe perform simulations on optimal symmetric networks,\nwhose structure is determined by the branching exponents of\nEq. (13). For simplicity, we use the simplified model relative\nviscosity (Eq. (12)) rather than Eq. (6). The branching\nexponents of Eq. (13) are obtained by fixing H = 0.45 in Eq.\n(6). If we fix H = 0.45 in Eq. (13), by comparison to Eq. (6),\nwe can obtain the corresponding values of b(H = 0.45) =\n2.81 and c(H = 0.45) = 0.62.\nThe rest of the parameters needed to determine the\nrelative viscosity (Eq. (12)) are obtained from Eq. (6) with\nH = 0.45. We will take Rmin = 25 Am, Rsat = 100 Am, and\nlsat (H = 0.45) = 3.2. The network is generated according to\nEq. (A.16). We have taken R1 = 350 Am, L1 = 0.7 cm, PH =\n100 mm Hg, and DPT = 80 mm Hg.\nWe have carried out simulations for q = 1, so that all the\nvessels in the network have the same length (results shown\nin Fig. 6). All the vessels within a generation have the same\nradius. The results of these numerical computations are\nillustrated in Fig. 6. We compare these results to the results\nreported by Pries et al. (1995) (Figs. 1, 3, and 5).\nOur predictions of the wall shear stress as a function of the\npressure exhibit a behavior resembling the experimental\nobservations. If we compare our simulation results for q = 1\n(Fig. 6a) and the data shown in Pries et al. (1995), Fig. 3 for\narterioles (we are considering a vascular tree, not a full\nvascular network with a venous side), the 5-fold drop in the\nwall shear stress we observe is consistent with the average\ndrop observed experimentally (see Pries et al., 1995; Fig. 3).\nSimulation results for the radius as a function of pressure\n(Fig. 6c) are in good agreement with the observations (see\nPries et al., 1995; Fig. 5). The relationships we obtain\nbetween flow velocity and vessel radius are also in qualitative\nagreement (compare Fig. 6b with Pries et al., 1995, Fig. 1),\nalthough concavity is lacking. However, quantitative agree-\nment is poor: we are predicting flow velocities two orders of\nmagnitude higher than those observed experimentally.\nThe results obtained for v(R) for small vessels might result\na bit surprising. However, the origins of this non-monotonic\ndependence of v on R can be easily understood in terms of the\nFig. 6. Simulation results for a symmetrically branching network with q =\n1, i.e., all the vessels have the same length. Constant hematocrit is assumed.\nPanels a and b show the wall shear stress as a function of the pressure and\nthe flow velocity as a function of the radius, respectively. Panel c shows the\nradius as a function of the pressure. The viscosity is given by Eq. (12) with\nH = 0.45. See text for parameter values.\nT.

For R < Rmin, l(R) decreases as\na function of R, whereas for Rmin < R < Rsat, l(R) increases.\nAccordingly, as R increases, so does v as long as R < Rmin.\nWhen Rmin < R < Rsat l(R), as the viscosity increases, v\ndecreases. For R > Rsat, the viscosity is kept constant but the\nresistance Z \u00a8 lsat\/R\n4 is a decreasing function of R and\ntherefore v increases. Note that the boundaries between the\nregions in which v(R) shows these different behaviors\ncorrespond to Rmin and Rsat.\nIt might be surprising that we obtain 5-fold to 8-fold\nreductions in the WSS for a small change in the value of the\nrelative viscosity4. However, for example in the case q = 1,\nby comparing s (Rsat) and s (Rmin), we obtain (see Eqs. ),\n(12) and (13):\ns Rmin\u00f0 \u00de\ns Rsat\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 4\u0007 c H\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00071=2 Rmin\nRsat\n\u0005 \u0006c H\u00f0 \u00de\n\u02da 0:23; \u00f021\u00de\nwhere we have used the parameter values given in Table 1.\nThis result is consistent with our simulations.\nThe role of hematocrit: asymmetric bifurcations\nSo far, we have presented results concerning symmetri-\ncally branching networks with uniform hematocrit, assuming\nonly a non-monotonical dependence of the viscosity on the\nradius of the vessel (Fig. 4).Although our results appear to\ncapture some of the experimentally observed trends, our\napproach so far has one serious weakness: it implies a very\ntight control system for the developing vasculature and leaves\nno room for noise or variability in the structure of the vascular\nnetwork.\nAs we show in Appendix A, by formulating our design\nprinciple in the form of a relationship between radius and\nblood flow, the final structure of the network is imposed by\nconservation laws. In the uniform hematocrit case, the only\npossible source of heterogeneity is a rather narrow window\nwhere asymmetric bifurcations are possible (see Appendix\nA for details).\nHowever, the inclusion of variable hematocrit naturally\nintroduces a source of heterogeneity into the possible\nstructures our branching network can exhibit. As we show\nin Appendix A, there are several possible asymmetric\nbifurcations with a wide range of feasibility.\nWe now analyze the properties of networks that were\ngenerated by taking advantage of such variability.\nViscosity parameters\nBefore proceeding further, we need to determine the form\nof the functions b(H), c(H), and lsat(H) appearing in the\nexpression for the viscosity (Eq. (12)). We will fit them\nusing the data provided by Eq. (6).4 In the range of radii values in which we are doing our simulations, the\nrelative viscosity is reduced by a factor 1.5 (see Fig. 2).\nFig. 7. These panels show the dependence of the hematocrit of (a)b, (b) c, and\n(c) lsat. The circles represent in each case values obtained from analysis of the\nexperimental data (Eq. (6) see text for details). Solid lines correspond to the\nfits we have used: linear for c and quadratic for b and lsat. The expressions\nwe have obtained from the fitting procedure are given in Table 1.\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 163To determine b(H) and c(H), we have proceeded as\nfollows. First, we have repeated the procedure we followed\nin The design principles to obtain the branching exponents\nai(H) for different values of the hematocrit. Then, using\nthese values for ai(H) and Eq. (14), we obtain b(H) and\nc(H). The results are plotted in Figs. 7a and b, respectively.\nThe data corresponding to c(H) fit quite well to a straight\nline (Fig. 7b). For b(H), a quadratic provides a better fit.\nlsat(H) was more straightforward to determine. We give a\nvery large value to R in Eq. (12), in particular R = 1 cm, for\ndifferent values of the hematocrit. The corresponding values\nof lrel are those we take for lsat(H), which are plotted in\nFig. 7c. We fit these data using a quadratic. A summary of\nour results is given in Table 1.\nBlood flow simulations in optimal networks with asymmetric\nbifurcations\nTo obtain a general idea of the effects that the\nintroduction of hematocrit and asymmetric bifurcations\nproduce on the blood flow through our optimal networks,\nwe have first performed simulations in which preference is\ngiven to the occurrence of asymmetric bifurcations: when\ngenerating the optimal network, we first try one of the\nthree asymmetric bifurcations described in Appendix A. If\nthe bifurcation meets the corresponding feasibility criteria\n(see Appendix A), then the asymmetric bifurcation is\nimplemented. Only when the asymmetric bifurcation is\nnot possible is a symmetric bifurcation used. This is the\nprocedure we have used to generate the results shown in\nFigs. 8 and 9.\nFig. 8 summarizes results for such an optimal branching\nnetwork, containing asymmetric bifurcations of type NS1\nand NS3 (see Appendix A for the nomenclature) and\nsymmetric bifurcations. Fig. 9 shows the results for an\noptimal branching network containing asymmetric bifurca-\ntions of type NS2 and NS3 (see Appendix A for the\nnomenclature) and symmetric bifurcations.\nFigs. 8a and 9a show how the wall shear stress varies as\na function of the pressure for the respective networks. In\nboth cases, there is what we might term a \u2018\u2018two-branch\u2019\u2019\nbehavior. One of the branches exhibits the type of\nsigmoidal behavior observed by Pries et al. (see Fig. 3 in\nPries et al., 1995 and link: Fig. 4 in Pries et al., 1998). The\nslope is steeper for the network containing NS1 asym-\nmetric bifurcations. The other branch appears to have\nsmaller values of the wall shear stress. This two-branch\nbehavior is a consequence of the presence of asymmetric\nbifurcations:NS1 and NS2 yield bifurcations with daughter\nvessels showing very different values of the radii (Figs. 8c\nand 9c) and hematocrit (see Figs. 8d and 9d). In particular,\none of the daughter vessels is much wider and carries\nmuch more hematocrit (see Figs. 8d and 9d) and blood\nflow than the other. This fact, together with the strong\ndependence of viscosity on both radius and hematocrit,\nexplains why the smaller branch has a level of wall shear\nstress that is much smaller than the bigger branch.\nFig. 8. Results of the blood simulations we have performed on an optimal network with three types of bifurcation: NS1-type asymmetric, NS3-type asymmetric,\nand symmetric (see text for details). These plots show the hemodynamic quantities corresponding to each one of the vessels, so that every circle represents an\nindividual vessel of the vascular tree. In the case of the pressure, it is calculated in the middle point of each one of the vessels. (a) Wall shear stress as a function\nof pressure, (b) flow velocity as a function of radius, and (c and d) radius and hematocrit as a function of the branching generation, respectively. For these\nsimulations: R1 = 120 Am, H1 = 0.2, and L1 = 0.24 cm. The parameter values are given in Table 1.\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172164Some of the smaller branches are likely to undergo\nvessel pruning driven by some flow-related signal,\nprobably wall shear stress (Resnick et al., 2003). In\nparticular, the tiny vessels generated by NS2 asymmetric\nbifurcations at the earlier bifurcations (see Fig. 10) have a\nvery low level of wall shear stress which might trigger\napoptosis of the endothelial cells and, consequently, vessel\npruning. Since knowledge of the mechanisms involved in\nthis process is rather poor, we have not included this\nphenomenon in our model. However, from the experimen-\ntal results (Fig. 3 in Pries et al., 1995), we can see that\nlevels of wall shear stress might be too low for vessel\nsurvival when P = 60 mm Hg, whereas the values of the\nwall shear stress corresponding to P = 20 mm Hg seem to\nbe feasible. Our conclusion is that any potential survival\nmechanism would depend not only on the wall shear stress\nbut also on the pressure.Now that we have a general flavor of the kind of\nbehavior we can expect when hematocrit and asymmetric\nbifurcations are introduced, we present simulations per-\nformed on heterogeneous optimal networks. To build up\nthese heterogeneous networks we proceed as follows. If the\nparent vessel radius Rp > Rsat, we choose at random\nbetween NS1 and NS2 asymmetric bifurcations. If,\nhowever, Rmin < Rp < Rsat, we choose at random between\na NS3 asymmetric bifurcation and a symmetric bifurcation.\nIf the radii of the daughter vessels do not meet the\nfeasibility criteria (see Appendix A) when an asymmetric\nbifurcation is attempted, we enforce a symmetric bifurcation\ninstead.\nAgain, we obtain results which qualitatively reproduce\nthe experimental observations of Pries et al. (1995). In this\ncase, we obtain the 10-fold reduction in the wall shear\nstress observed in the simulations reported by Pries et al.\nFig. 9. Results of the simulations we have performed on an optimal network with three types of bifurcation: NS2-type asymmetric, NS3-type asymmetric, and\nsymmetric (see text for details). These plots show the hemodynamic quantities corresponding to each one of the vessels, so that every circle represents an\nindividual vessel of the vascular tree. In the case of the pressure, it is calculated in the middle point of each one of the vessels. (a) Wall shear stress as a function\nof pressure, (b) flow velocity as a function of radius, and (c and d) radius and hematocrit as a function of the branching generation, respectively. For these\nsimulations: R1 = 120 Am, H1 = 0.2, and L1 = 0.24 cm. The parameter values are given in Table 1.\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 165(see Fig. 4 in Pries et al., 1998), with which we observe\ngood quantitative agreement, except for the loss of\nconcavity. As we have mentioned, this fact might be due\nto the absence in our model of a mechanism implementing\nwall-shear-stress-induced vascular remodeling (Resnick et\nal., 2003).\nRegarding other hemodynamic quantities of interest, we\nhave computed flow velocity as a function of the radius\nfor our three different networks (see Figs. 8b, 9b, and\n10b). Pries et al. (1995) reported experimental measure-\nments of the flow velocity for radii up to 30 Am (Fig. 1 in\nPries et al., 1995). From Fig. 11b, we see that we obtain\nvalues for the flow velocity very similar to the observed\nones in for radii between 1 Am and10 Am. Figs. 11a and c\nshow that the quantitative agreement is relatively poorer\nfor vessels with radii between 10 and 30 Am, specially for\nradii between 10 and 20 Am, where we obtain vessel\nvelocities one order of magnitude bigger than the experi-ments. In the region between 20 and 30 Am, we obtain\nbetter quantitative agreement, as the predicted velocities\nare about twice as big as those observed and hence we\ncapture the right order of magnitude. For example, for R =\n30 Am, v \u02da 10 mm\/s according to the experiments (Fig. 1\nin Pries et al., 1995) and v \u02da 25 mm\/s according to our\nmodel.\nAnother observation about the behavior of this hetero-\ngeneous optimal network is derived from Fig. 12.\nExperimentally, the value of the branching exponent is\nobtained by collecting data for junctions over many\nvascular generations and averaging to obtain an estimate\n(Frame and Sarelius, 1995). If we were to do this,\naccording to Fig. 12, we would obtain a figure very close\nto 3, i.e., Murray\u2019s law. However, Murray\u2019s law predicts a\nuniform value of the wall shear stress. This apparent\ncontradiction comes from the fact that we are using a local\nbifurcation law (Eq. (9)), rather than a global one with an\nFig. 10. Results of the simulations in an optimal heterogeneous network. To generate this network, we have chosen at random one of the possible bifurcations,\neither symmetric or asymmetric (see text for details).

Our local bifurcation law\ndepends on the radius and the hematocrit through the\ncoefficients Ci (Ri, Hi) and ai (Ri, Hi). Karau et al. (2001)\nobtained similar results on studying vascular trees with\nheterogeneous branching exponents: even when the mean\nvalue of the branching exponent is 3, non-uniform wall shear\nstress was observed. Their conclusion was that the influence\non the wall shear stress in determining vessel radius is not\nnecessarily manifested in a mean value of the branching\nexponent.Conclusions\nBy extending the basic scheme proposed by Murray\n(1926) to introduce such features as complex blood\nrheology and hematocrit, we have formulated a designprinciple whose results are in good qualitative agreement\nwith experimental observations of hydrodynamic quantities.\nSimulations carried out in branching networks whose\ngeometry is determined according to our design principle\nreproduce experimentally observed trends of the WSS and\nthe flow velocity (Pries et al., 1995). From the quantitative\npoint of view, the results obtained for the wall shear stress\nare compatible with simulation results reported by Pries et\nal. (1998) and the experimental results by Pries et al.\n(1995). Our quantitative predictions concerning flow\nvelocity are of the same order of magnitude as those\nobserved in experiments (Pries et al., 1995) in several\nranges of vessels radii.\nWe have introduced two theoretical issues in this paper\nwhich are important: heterogeneity in the network and of\nlocal bifurcation laws. By including complex blood rheol-\nogy, in the form of hematocrit and radius dependent\nFig. 11. Flow velocity as a function of the radius for our three different\nnetworks.

In turn, this provides a natural way of introducing\nheterogeneity into our model. If the viscosity is assumed\nconstant (Murray, 1926), our analysis in Appendix A would\nimply that only symmetric bifurcations are possible, leaving\nno room for heterogeneity.\nA local bifurcation law Eq. (9) arises naturally in our\nmodel. This local bifurcation law reconciles the observation\nof a non-uniform wall shear stress with an average (global)\nvalue of the branching exponent very close to 3. This result\nis in agreement with previous work (Karau et al., 2001). It\nalso reconciles the experimental observation of a non-\nuniform wall shear stress (Pries et al., 1995) with the\ngeometrical design principle of Gafiychuk and Lubashevsky\n(2001), who, from the requirement of a space filling\nnetwork, deduced that the branching exponent should be\nequal to three.\nOne major weakness of our model when dealing with\nmicrocirculation is the use of Poiseuille\u2019s law. While this\nlaw accurately describes the flow in arterioles, it fails for\nthe smaller vessels. In order to extend our methodology to\ndescribe the vasculature within tumors, we would need to\naccount for fluid leakage from the vessel (Netti et al.,\n1996). We leave this as an open problem for future\ninvestigation.Acknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Axel Pries and Timothy\nSecomb for helpful comments.

A particular solution, and in fact the simplest\none, of Eqs. (A.8) and (A.9) is R4 = R5 = R6 = R7 and H4 =\nH5 = H6 = H7 since C(Ri, Hi) and a(Ri, Hi) are identical\nwhen Ri and Hi are identical. In this case, Eqs. (A.4) and\n(A.5) admit R2 = R3 and H2 = H3 as a possible solution.\nThus the simplest branching network that is consistent with\nour optimization principle is one for which all vessels in a\ngiven generation have the same radius.

A note concerning uniqueness\nWe showed above that it is possible to construct a\nsymmetric branching network that satisfies the restrictions\nimposed by Kirchoff\u2019s laws and our design principle. We\nnow show that this network is not unique, even when we\nassume that the lengths of the vessels in the same\ngeneration are equal.\nConsider first the case in which hematocrit is not taken into\naccount: fix in Eqs. (A.1) (A.2) (A.3) (A.4) (A.5) (A.6) (A.7) and\nEqs. (A.14) and (A.15) Hi = 0.45, i = 1,. . .,7 and neglect\nEqs. (A.8) (A.9) (A.10) (A.11) (A.12) (A.13). Consider the\nresulting Eqs. (A.14) and (A.15), the solution to these equa-\nFig. A.1. Schematic representation showing the bivalued character of the\nviscosity. See text for details.\nT. Alarco\u00b4n et al. \/ Microvascular Research 69 (2005) 156\u2013172 169tions is unique if the viscosity is a monotonic univalued\nfunction of the radius. However, as we show in Fig. A.1,\nthere is a range of values of the radius for which the viscosity\nis a non-monotonous function of the radius. Therefore,\nbifurcations at which the daughter vessels have different radii\nmay arise.\nIn order to address this question in more detail, we use the\nmodel viscosity stated in Eq. (12). Suppose that we are in the\nregion where viscosity is a multivalued function of the\nradius (i.e., R < Rsat), so that, for instance, Eq. (A.14) may\nbe satisfied by R4 = R5 such that R4 < Rmin < R5. The\ncondition for this to occur is\nRmin\nRsat\n\u0005 \u0006c=2\nR\nb=2\nmin\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\n4\u00fe b\ns\nR\n\u00071\u0007b=2\n4 \u00bc Rc=2min\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\n4\u0007 c\ns\nR\n\u00071 \u00fe c=2\n5 ;\n\u00f0A:18\u00de\nwhere we have introduced Eqs. (12) and (13) into Eq.\n(A.14). After some algebra we find:\nR4 \u00bc R\nb\nmin\nR\nc\nsat\n4\u0007 c\n4\u00fe b R\n2 \u0007 c\n5\n ! 1\n2\u00feb\n\u00f0A:19\u00de\nHence we deduce that if there are values of R5 Z\n(Rmin, Rsat) for which Eq. (A.19) yields R4 < Rmin, then\nit is possible to have an asymmetric bifurcation that\nis compatible with Kirchoff\u2019s laws and our design\nprinciple.Fig. A.2. Schematic of three possible asymmetric bifurcations wFrom Eq. (A.19), we observe that when c \t 2 there is\na range of values of R5 for which R4 < Rmin and, hence,\nfor which asymmetric branching may occur. However, for\nlarge values of R5, such asymmetric branching cannot\noccur. Given c \t 2, we determine the maximum value of\nR5 for which asymmetric branching can occur by fixing\nR4 = Rmin, to obtain\nRcrit \u00bc 4\u00fe b\n4\u0007 c R\n2\nminR\nc\nsat\n\u0005 \u00061= 2 \u0007 c\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f0A:20\u00de\nFrom Eq. (A.14) we see how changing the value of c\naffects the feasibility of the asymmetric bifurcation: for a\ngiven value of b, the asymmetric bifurcation becomes\nmore unlikely when c grows, as Rcrit becomes bigger\nthus reducing the interval of feasibility for the asym-\nmetric bifurcation. A similar behavior is observed when\nc is fixed and we allow variations in b: the higher b\nbecomes, the more improbable the asymmetric bifurca-\ntion becomes.\nThe inclusion of variable hematocrit in the model\nyields a wider variety of possibilities. Whereas there is\nonly one asymmetric bifurcation in the uniform hema-\ntocrit case, we have at least three different possibilities\nwhen variable hematocrit is accounted for (see Fig.\nA.2):\n& Parent vessel with radius R2 > Rsat: small daughter\nbranch with radius R4 such that Rmin < R4 < Rsat and large\ndaughter vessel with radius R5 > Rsat. The corresponding\nhematocrit values for the small branch H4 and the large\nbranch H5 must satisfy H4 > H5 This situation is referred to\nas NS1 (see Fig. A.2).\n& Parent vessel with radius R2 > Rsat: small daughter\nbranch with radius R4 such that R4 < Rmin and large\ndaughter vessel with radius R5 > Rsat.

Then,\nusing the design principle and the corresponding conserva-\ntion laws, we can obtain R4 and H4.\nDue to the complexity of Eqs. (A.21)\u2013(A.24), we\ncan no longer carry out as detailed an analysis as for the\nuniform hematocrit case. However, we can still gain some\ninsight from numerical solutions. We have used a Newton\u2013\nRaphson method for solving these systems of equations\n(Press et al., 1992). This numerical study allows us to assess\nunder which conditions we can obtain feasible bifurcations,\ni.e., which values of R2 and H2 (parent vessel radius and\nhematocrit) yield acceptable values of R4 and R5.\nIn the case of NS1 bifurcations, Fig. A.3a shows\nthat acceptable values of R5, i.e., R5 > Rsat\n5, for a5 Recall that Rmin = 0.0025 cm and Rmin = 0.01 cm.\nFig. A.5. Numerical results for NS3-type asymmetric bifurcations. Dashed\nline corresponds to H2 = 0.05, dotted line to H2 = 0.1, solid line to H2 =\n0.15, and dot-dashed line to H2 = 0.3.

However,\nacceptable values of R4, i.e., Rmin < R4 < Rsat, are obtained\nin a narrower range of values of R2 and H2. Fig. A.3b shows\nhow, as H2 decreases, the range of values of R2 for which an\nacceptable R4 is obtained gets smaller. Hence, the\nfeasibility of NS1 bifurcations is determined by the smaller\ndaughter branch. We also observe that the thinner the\nblood becomes (i.e., the smaller the H content) the less\nlikely this bifurcation becomes.\nFor NS2 bifurcations, we obtain similar results: R5\nplays no role in determining whether this type of\nbifurcation can actually occur (Fig. A.4a), R4 is again\nthe key quantity. One difference with respect to the\nprevious case is that for NS2 bifurcations the thicker\nthe blood becomes (i.e., the bigger the hematocrit) the\nmore improbable this type of bifurcation becomes\n(Fig. A.4b).\nThe situation with NS3 bifurcations is again similar: a\nminor role is played by R5 (Fig. A.5a) and again the\nbifurcation is less likely for thinner blood.References\nFrame, M.D.S., Sarelius, I.H., 1995.
