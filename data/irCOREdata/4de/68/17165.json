The study \nobjective is to assess the cost effectiveness of a vaccination program for this population in the UK.\nMethods: A state-transition Markov model has been developed to simulate the natural history of HZ and PHN and to \nestimate the lifetime effects of vaccination in the UK. Several health states are defined including good health, HZ, PHN, \nand death. HZ and PHN health states are further divided to reflect pain severity.\nResults: The model predicts that a vaccination strategy for those aged over 50 years would lead to an incremental \ncost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a313,077 per QALY gained from the NHS perspective, when compared to the current strategy \nof no vaccination. Age-group analyses show that the lowest ICERs (\u00a310,984 and \u00a310,275 for NHS) are observed when \nvaccinating people between 60-64 and 65-69 years of age. Sensitivity analyses showed that results are sensitive to the \nduration of vaccine protection, discount rate, utility decrements and pain severity split used.\nConclusions: Using the commonly accepted threshold of \u00a330,000 per QALY gained in the UK, most scenarios of \nvaccination programmes preventing HZ and PHN, including the potential use of a repeat dose, may be considered \ncost-effective by the NHS, especially within the 60 to 69 age-groups.\nBackground\nIn our aging society, diseases whose prevalence rises with\nage are of increasing significance. The varicella zoster\nvirus (VZV) causes chickenpox as the primary infection.\nReactivation of the dormant virus in the dorsal root gan-\nglia of individuals having had a primary infection can\noccur, causing herpes zoster (HZ) or \"shingles\". The life-\ntime risk of suffering from HZ is 25% [1]. HZ incidence\nincreases sharply with age, roughly doubling in each\ndecade past the age of 50 years [2]. Normal age-related\ndecrease in varicella zoster-specific cell-mediated immu-\nnity is thought to account for this increased incidence of\nVZV reactivation. The symptoms of HZ include numb-\nness, itching and pain during the prodromal phase\n(before the rash onset), followed by painful unilateral\nvesicular eruptions on the skin. The pain and cutaneous\neruptions usually subside after 3-4 weeks [3].\nIn about 20% to 25% of HZ cases [4], pain can persist\nfor months or years after the cutaneous eruption has\nhealed. Depending on the definition used, pain occurring\nor persisting at least 1 or 3 months after rash onset is\ntermed post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). While there is no\ninternational consensus on the definition of PHN, it is\nincreasingly commonly accepted that PHN is considered\nto be present if pain persists for more than 3 months or\nmore after rash onset [5,3,6]. With age as its primary risk\nfactor[4], the incidence of PHN is expected to increase in\nan ageing population. Many patients with PHN go on to\ndevelop severe physical, occupational and social disabili-\nties as a consequence of the enduring pain [4].\nA new live attenuated vaccine (Zostavax\u00ae) against vari-\ncella zoster virus infection is indicated in Europe for the\nprevention of HZ and HZ-related PHN from the age of\n50. The efficacy of this new vaccine has been tested in a\n* Correspondence: monique.martin@i3innovus.com\n1 i3 Innovus, Uxbridge, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Moore et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

This study, involving\n38,546 immunocompetent patients aged 60 years and\nolder, reported that vaccination reduced the incidence of\nHZ by 51.3% and reduced the severity of pain when HZ\noccurred in vaccinated individuals. Progression to PHN\nwas reduced by 66.5%, with a trend toward greater effi-\ncacy for PHN of longer duration [6]. In addition, the\nsafety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in the 50-59 age\ngroups has been explored in two clinical trials which\nshowed that the vaccine was well tolerated among\npatients aged 50 years and older and induced an immu-\nnogenic response not inferior to that of subjects 60 and\nolder and thereby provided an immunological bridge to\nvaccine efficacy demonstrated in the SPS (ref Oxman,\n2005) [7,8].\nIn order to estimate the potential effectiveness and\ncost-effectiveness of a vaccination programme against\nHZ and PHN in the UK, we have used a cohort model\nthat strikes a balance between real-life individual variabil-\nity and the more formal structures required for model-\nling. The model aims to accurately represent the\nepidemiology of HZ and PHN. In addition it aims to\nquantify the lifetime health benefits and economic effects\nof vaccination in the UK immunocompetent population\naged 50 and over.\nMethods\nA Markov model was developed to compare two policies:\nthe implementation of a vaccination policy in the UK,\nwhere a predetermined vaccine coverage rate is achieved\nfor each age group at the start of the model, and the cur-\nrent policy in the UK of no vaccination. Under these two\npolicies, the following outcomes were compared for the\nlifetime: HZ cases and PHN cases, quality-adjusted life-\nyears (QALYs) and total costs. These outcomes resulted\nin the calculations of incremental cost-effectiveness\nratios (ICERs), including cost per QALY gained, cost per\nHZ case avoided, and cost per PHN case avoided, and the\nnumber needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one\noccurrence of HZ or PHN. Both a NHS (National Health\nService) perspective and a societal perspective were con-\nsidered. The NHS perspective includes all health care\nrelated expenses, as the national health care system is\ntax-funded and universally accessible. The societal per-\nspective includes in addition to healthcare expenses, pro-\nductivity costs due to time off work, but no co-payments.\nModel features\nThis model utilises a Markov process to simulate the life-\ntime incidence and consequences of HZ among a popula-\ntion aged 50 and over, corresponding to the therapeutic\nindication of the HZ vaccine Zostavax\u00ae. The model was\ndeveloped in Microsoft Excel 2003. The population is\nanalysed as separate 5 year age cohorts (i.e. the 50-54 year\nold population is first analysed over its lifetime, then the\n55-59 year old population, etc.). The state-transition\nMarkov model describes several health states including\nhealthy (i.e. no HZ symptoms), HZ, PHN, and death. HZ\nand PHN health states are further divided into different\npain severity levels. Recurrent HZ and the subsequent\nneuropathic pain are also allowed states, but are con-\nstrained to a one-time only recurrent episode. Figure 1\nshows the potential health states, with arrows indicating\npossible transitions between states. The model runs in\nMarkov cycles of one month to represent the average\nduration of an episode of HZ. Within each 1 month cycle,\nthe cohort members may remain in their current health\nstate or transit to one of the allowable states. Transitions\nare governed by a matrix of probability values. With each\nsuccessive cycle, an increasing proportion of the cohort\nmoves through the HZ and PHN states and eventually to\ndeath. The model runs through sufficient cycles until the\nentire cohort has died.\nMovement from healthy to \"HZ\" is based on monthly\nage-specific HZ incidence rates. Individuals are allocated\nto one of the four HZ pain severity levels (no, mild, mod-\nerate and severe pain). In the following month, a propor-\ntion of these HZ patients will develop PHN. The\nliterature indicates that patients have a higher risk of\ndeveloping PHN if they experience severe pain during\nHZ. To reflect the increased (decreased) odds of develop-\ning PHN by patients suffering from a severe (mild) HZ\npain episode relative to moderate HZ pain information\nfrom the literature was used by applying odds ratios of\n2.39 for severe pain and 0.88 for mild pain [9]. Hence,\npatients with severe (mild) pain are 2.39 (0.88) times\nmore (less) likely to develop PHN than patients with\nmoderate level of pain.\nNew PHN patients were distributed over three initial\npain severity levels (mild, moderate, or severe) deter-\nmined at diagnosis. It was assumed that the PHN-related\npain diminishes over time and eventually ceases. There-\nfore, an individual can either remain in the same state or\ntransition to a less severe PHN pain state each month. All\nmust go through the mild PHN pain state to attain a\nhealthy (post-zoster) state. Consequently, the average\nduration of PHN depends on the initial PHN pain split of\nthe population (as it will take longer for 'severe' patients\nto return to health than for 'mild' patients) and on the\ntransition probabilities used between PHN pain states\nand the post-HZ healthy state. It was therefore essential\nto calibrate these transition probabilities to reflect the\naverage duration of PHN from the literature. The model\nassumed that the transition rate from severe to moderate\nPHN, moderate to mild, and mild to healthy (post-zoster)\nwere identical. This constant rate differed by age group as\nolder patients experience longer duration of pain [6].\nMoore et al.

Cunningham [10]\nreported a 1%-5% lifetime risk of recurrent zoster. The\nmid-point from the Cunningham data, 3%, was used to\ndetermine the incidence of recurrent HZ by applying it to\nthe average life expectancy for individuals having experi-\nenced a first zoster episode. Characteristics of a recurrent\nHZ patient (duration, initial pain split, subsequent PHN)\nwas assumed to be identical to the first-time experience.\nAge-specific mortality rates were applied to each health\nstate to determine the monthly probability of transition-\ning to \"Death\".\nModel Inputs\nInput Sources\nInputs used to populate the model were derived from sev-\neral sources presented in Tables 1 and 2. Our model was\nmainly informed based on a recent retrospective UK\ndatabase analysis [11]. This provided the model with\nrecent epidemiological and healthcare resource use infor-\nmation with the exception of hospitalisations and pro-\nductivity losses. Ultimately, additional data from the\nliterature were used to populate selected input parame-\nters, such as hospitalisation rates [12], utility decrements\n[13], pain split and PHN duration [6]. Moreover, two\nparameters (days of work lost due to HZ and PHN and\nprobable vaccine administration characteristics) have\nbeen made up on expert opinions due to the lack of data\nin these matters.\nEpidemiology of HZ and PHN\nEpidemiological inputs are provided in Table 1. HZ inci-\ndence rates for 2000-2006 were used from the GPRD\nanalysis, described above, based on a sample of 27,225\nFigure 1 Model Health States.\nMoore et al.

The SPS trial provided data by\npatient group for the duration of pain in HZ [6]. These\nconfirmed that most patients experience a 30-day dura-\ntion of pain, as reported in the literature [9,14].\nThe monthly-cycle model structure requires utilisation\nof PHN data based on a 1-month definition. Where only\nPHN data was available using a 3-month definition,\nappropriate input values using a 1-month definition were\ncalibrated in order to match the available 3-month data\nfollowing 3 months of the Markov process. The PHN pro-\nportion was estimated from the GPRD database [11]. It\nwas assumed that only HZ states associated with pain\ncould result in PHN, as it is unlikely that PHN will ensue\nif no pain is present during the HZ eruption. Therefore,\nPHN proportion was adjusted in the model in order to be\nderived only from painful HZ states, while still retaining\nthe overall PHN proportion level obtained from the data-\nbase analysis [11].\nAn important aspect of the model was the split\nbetween the different pain states for HZ, as these are\nlinked to PHN probability and treatment costs. SPS data\n[6,15] were used for HZ and initial PHN pain severity.\nThis provided information on HZ severity levels by\nmeans of a special questionnaire specifically developed to\nassess HZ and PHN associated pain (the Zoster Brief Pain\nInventory, or ZBPI [16]). SPS results were also selected\nfor PHN duration, as pain severity and duration are\nlinked in the model and therefore should be retrieved\nfrom the same source.\nRecurrent annual HZ \nIncidence\nAge 50 - 54 0.10% -\nAge 55 - 59 0.12% -\nAge 60 - 64 0.15% -\nAge 65 - 69 0.18% -\nAge 70 - 74 0.23% -\nAge 75 - 79 0.31% -\nAge 80 - 84 0.42% -\nAge 85 - 89 0.58% -\nAge 90 - 94 0.83% -\nAge 95 - 99 1.15% -\nAge 100+ 1.40% -\nQuality of Life\nUtility Decrements Oster 2005 [13] SPS Trial - Pellissier 2007 [15]\/Bala 1998 [29]\nNo pain 0.00 - 0.14\/0.00 -\nMild pain 0.31 0.31 0.23\/0.27 0.23\/0.27\nModerate pain 0.42 0.42 0.32\/0.40 0.32\/0.40\nSevere pain 0.75 0.75 0.45\/0.53 0.45\/0.53\nVaccine \ncharacteristics\nSPS Trial 2005 [6]\nEfficacy: total % \nreduction in cases \n(PHN direct effect)\nAge \u2264 69 63.9% 66.7% (4.8%)\nAge \u2265 70 37.6% 66.8% (30.0%*)\nEfficacy: number of \nmonths reduction of \nPHN pain\nAge \u2264 69 - -2.2\nAge \u2265 70 - -3.3\n*Calculated based on the midpoint lifetime risk of HZ recurrence from Cunningham et al.

Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation 2010, 8:7\nhttp:\/\/www.resource-allocation.com\/content\/8\/1\/7\nPage 6 of 14The GPRD analysis found that women accounted for\n61% of all HZ cases and 65% of all PHN cases [11]. This\naffected several aspects of the model, including the utility\ndecrements, as women experience systematically lower\nage-specific utility values than men, and productivity\ncosts, since women have lower employment rates among\nthe applicable age groups in the UK.\nInformation from the GPRD analysis indicated no mor-\ntality directly linked to HZ or PHN. This was confirmed\nby the lack of literature on the subject, however rates\nreported by Edmunds et al. 2001 were tested in sensitivity\nanalyses.\nResource utilisation and costs\nAll costs in Table 2 are presented in 2006 UK \u00a3s. The\nmodel assumes that patients are diagnosed and treated by\nGPs. Referrals to specialists are subsequent to at least one\nGP visit. Mean monthly health care costs per HZ and\nPHN case were obtained from the GPRD analysis by\nseverity. The analysis found no significant relationship\nbetween age and health care costs, thus values were\napplied in the model only for severity. As expected, pain\nseverity increases costs [11].\nDue to limitations of GPRD regarding inpatient data,\nthe literature was reviewed as a supplement to select an\nappropriate approximation for HZ and PHN hospitalisa-\ntion rates. Information from the 2004-2005 Hospital Epi-\nsode statistics [17] (HES) for the number of HZ and PHN\nhospitalisations could be closely replicated by applying\nthe Edmunds [12] reported hospitalisation rates (also\nbased on the HES) to all HZ cases which experienced\npain (that is, only HZ associated with mild, moderate, or\nsevere pain) and all PHN cases. Therefore, the Edmunds\nhospitalisation rates [12] were used. The mean length of\nhospital stay was also taken from the HES [17] using the\nappropriate ICD-10 codes (HZ: B02 codes excluding\nB02.2 and PHN: B02.2). The daily cost associated with a\nnon-elective inpatient stay due to viral illness from the\nNHS Reference Costs [18] was applied to calculate the\ntotal hospitalisation cost per inpatient case.\nProductivity losses were based on the number of work-\ndays lost due to disease. The data concerning the number\nof workdays lost were gathered from expert opinion.\nExperts emphasised the need for HZ patients, even with\nno pain, to abstain from work, as they would be infectious\nduring the early phases of their HZ infection. UK employ-\nment data [19] and average wage values [20] were gath-\nered to compute the average daily productivity losses,\nwhich were only included for persons aged 69 or less.\nVaccination characteristics\nVaccine efficacy was taken from the clinical trial SPS [6].\nThe efficacy data for age groups 50-59 years were\nassumed to be identical to ones for the 60-69 age group as\nthis can be supported by the available immunogenicity\nresults [7,21] providing an immunological bridge to vac-\ncine efficacy demonstrated in the SPS [6,10]. Several\neffects of vaccination are included in the model, both\ndirect and indirect (Table 1) (see Additional File 1). The\nvaccine has a direct effect on the number and severity of\nHZ and PHN cases, which differed by age. Since HZ must\nprecede PHN, the number of PHN cases is also indirectly\nreduced through the reduction in the HZ cases. In addi-\ntion, vaccination reduces the duration of PHN. In the\nmodel, this indirectly affects the pain severity experi-\nenced by the patient since it implies a shorter period of\ntime spent in each painful PHN health state. This was\nincorporated in the model by adjusting the age-specific\ntransition probabilities between PHN states for both vac-\ncinated and non-vaccinated individuals, as described ear-\nlier. These adjustments reflect the vaccine efficacy in\nreducing the Burden of Illness (BOI is a severity-by-dura-\ntion measure of the total pain), defined as primary clini-\ncal endpoint of the SPS.\nIn the base case, the vaccine efficacy is expected to last\na lifetime. While the efficacy of the vaccine may diminish\nover time, the lengths of the clinical trials are currently\nnot sufficient to accurately document this, though more\nreliable data may become available in the future. A wan-\ning function, currently set at 0% as described in the litera-\nture [15], has been included in the model for this\npurpose. Alternative assumptions examining shorter vac-\ncine efficacy durations and including the need for a\nrepeat dose or possible waning in vaccine efficacy were\nconsidered in the sensitivity analysis.\nA vaccine coverage rate of 40% was assumed for all ages\nfrom the age of 50. The current reported coverage in the\nUK in the over 65 year old age group for influenza vaccine\n(approximately 70% [20]) or pneumococcal polysaccha-\nride vaccine (64% [21]) was seen as the absolute maxi-\nmum attainable vaccine coverage rate for the vaccine\nagainst HZ. Thus, the selected rate of 40% was perceived\nto be an attainable yet realistic rate for base-case.\nCosts related to the administration of the vaccine were\nincluded. We assumed that in 50% of cases the vaccine\nwould be administered by a nurse during a vaccination\nappointment and in 50% of cases by a GP during a routine\nvisit. For the latter case, as patients would be vaccinated\nduring a routine visit only the costs specific to the admin-\nistration of the vaccine were included. Unit costs associ-\nated with vaccination administration were derived from\nthe Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) [22].\nUtilities\nAge-specific utilities were used from the Health Survey\nfor England [23]. Those are for 10-year age bands. 5-year\nage-specific utility values were obtained from the Cana-\ndian Health Utilities Index (HUI) Mark 3 [24] and extrap-\nolated to the UK population (see Additional File 2). As\nregards to the decrement caused by pain, the model used\nutilities derived from Oster [13], which were obtained in\nMoore et al.

It is\nexpected that the utility associated with the different lev-\nels of pain severity will not vary between the various\ncauses of neuropathic pain. In particular, a recent publi-\ncation McDermott et al. [25] investigated the quality of\nlife in neuropathic pain patients in five European coun-\ntries reporting utility weights by severity. These weights\nare very similar to the values reported by Oster, indicat-\ning that the latter are appropriate to feed the model. In\naddition, according to expert opinion while age-specific\nutilities do differ between countries, the decrements due\nto disease may be considered similar, and thus the US\nOster decrements were considered suitable for the UK\nanalysis.\nTo calculate utilities, the decrements related to the pain\nstates are applied to the age-specific utilities using an\nadditive approach, i.e. pain decrements are subtracted\nfrom the age-specific utilities (see Additional File 2).\nPopulation characteristics\nThe population size was obtained from the UK national\nstatistics office [19] and totals 20,174,786 persons aged 50\nand older as reported for mid-year 2004. Cost-effective-\nness was analysed by 5-year age-groups within this popu-\nlation UK general mortality rates were obtained from the\ngovernment actuarial department [26].\nDiscounting\nThe discount rate used for the base case analysis is 3.5%\nfor costs and 3.5% for outcomes (QALYs) as recom-\nmended by NICE. There is controversy regarding\nwhether monetary costs and health benefits should be\ndiscounted at the same rate or differentially, particularly\nwhen evaluating public health programmes such as vacci-\nnation [27,28]. It is often argued that the benefits of\nhealth promotion strategies should be discounted at a\nlower rate than those of costs, so as to prioritise health\npromotion and disease prevention over curative treat-\nments [27]. As a result, different discount rates were\ntested in sensitivity analyses.\nSensitivity Analyses\nThe sensitivity of the base case ICER to alternative values\nof significant input parameters was explored by varying\nthese within feasible ranges. A number of univariate sen-\nsitivity analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the\neffect of different parameters on the results and to iden-\ntify the variables driving the results. This included varia-\ntions on the discount rate, HZ incidence and mortality\nassumptions [12], vaccine efficacy, duration of vaccine\nefficacy (varied by both an assumption of limited dura-\ntion of full vaccine efficacy followed by no efficacy and\nalso by utilising a waning rate [15]) and utilisation of a\nvaccine repeat dose at 10 years after first dose, vaccina-\ntion coverage rates by age, health care costs, vaccination\ncosts, utility decrements [15,29], and the HZ\/PHN pain\nsplit used [11]. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA)\nwas also performed and several parameters were\nincluded. In particular, HZ vaccine efficacy was tested by\nvarying the base efficacy using a beta distribution and by\nincluding a waning rate [15] varied uniformly. HZ mortal-\nity was also varied uniformly from the base scenario value\nof 0% to the age-specific values found in the Edmunds et\nal. publication [12]. HZ and PHN utility decrements were\ntested using a lognormal distribution [13]. Data gathered\nfrom the GPRD analysis, including health care resource\ncosts and HZ incidence and PHN proportion, were varied\nover a normal and beta distribution respectively [11].\nValidation\nOnce the model had been developed, it was validated by\ncomparison to the available clinical data. Using the clini-\ncal information from the SPS trial comparing vaccine\nwith placebo [6], we were able to replicate exactly the\nnumber of HZ cases and PHN cases (using a 3-month\ndefinition, reflecting the primary PHN endpoint defini-\ntion considered in the trial) seen in the SPS placebo arm\nover a period of three years (the duration of the clinical\ntrial), 642 and 80 cases, respectively. For the vaccine arm\nwe obtained the identical number of HZ cases reported in\nthe trial (315 cases) [6,30]. Because there are two PHN\nendpoints of interest (1 and 3-months definition), the\ndirect PHN vaccine efficacy input parameter was\nadjusted in the model in order to best reflect the efficacy\nin reducing the incidence of PHN. As a result, the PHN\nvaccine efficacy input parameter used in the model over-\nestimated PHN using a 1-month definition by 0.3 per-\ncentage points (59.2% compared to the trial reported\n58.9% [6,30]) and underestimated PHN using a 3-month\ndefinition by 0.3 percentage points (66.2% instead of the\ntrial reported 66.5% [6,30]). However, as this estimation\nerror is quite small, we were still able to replicate the\nnumber of PHN (3-month definition) cases in the vaccine\narm (27 cases). Therefore all primary clinical endpoints\nfrom the SPS were successfully replicated in the model,\nproviding confidence that the model generates a valid\nestimate of clinical benefit.\nResults\nBase Case\nThe base case results predict that the vaccination would\nbring benefits in the form of reduced numbers of HZ and\nPHN cases and QALYs gained at additional cost.\nOver the lifetime of the current aged 50 and older UK\npopulation, without vaccination, it is estimated that there\nwould be 2,307,719 cases of HZ, and either 521,616 or\n477,532 cases of PHN using a 1- or 3-month definition,\nrespectively. By comparing this to the vaccination strat-\negy with a 40% coverage rate, there would be 22.7% fewer\nHZ cases, 26.6% fewer PHN cases using a 1-month defi-\nMoore et al. Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation 2010, 8:7\nhttp:\/\/www.resource-allocation.com\/content\/8\/1\/7\nPage 9 of 14nition, and 28.9% fewer PHN cases using a 3-month defi-\nnition. More PHN cases are avoided when using a 3-\nmonth definition due to the shorter duration of PHN for\nthe vaccinated population which results in more episodes\nresolving within 3 months. Over a lifetime, a total of\n57,589 quality-adjusted life years would be gained by such\nvaccination strategy. The model also calculated the num-\nber needed to vaccinate in order to avoid one case of HZ\nand PHN (both definitions), namely 15 and 58 respec-\ntively.\nThe estimated costs varied according to the perspective\ntaken either from NHS or from society. The difference in\ncosts between the two perspectives provides information\non the total productivity losses due to HZ and PHN. Over\na lifetime of the current aged 50 and older UK population\n(no vaccination policy population), approximately \u00a3363\nmillion or 3.9 million workdays are lost due to HZ and\nPHN. Accordingly, the ICERs for the societal perspective\nare notably lower than for the NHS perspective.\nThe resulting ICERs, presented in Table 3, were\n\u00a313,077 per QALY gained, \u00a31,440 per HZ avoided, \u00a35,421\nper PHN (1-month definition) avoided and \u00a35,453 per\nPHN (3-month definition) avoided from the NHS per-\nspective, and \u00a311,417 per QALY gained, \u00a31,258 per HZ\navoided, \u00a34,733 per PHN (1-month definition) avoided\nand \u00a34,761 per PHN (3-month definition) avoided from\nthe societal perspective.\nSeparate ICERs per 5-year age-group over a lifetime\nwere also calculated, providing an overview of which age\ngroups are more cost-effective to vaccinate. From Figure\n2, ICERs remain less than the commonly accepted\nthreshold \u00a330,000\/QALY gained[31] for persons aged less\nthan 85, with the lowest ICERs from a NHS perspective\nfound for those aged 65 to 69 (\u00a310,275 per QALY gained)\nand for those aged 60 to 64 (\u00a3 10,984 per QALY gained).\nBy summing the incremental costs and QALYs of the vac-\ncinated populations of interest, the overall ICER associ-\nated with any age-specific vaccination strategy can be\nobserved. For instance, vaccinating only those aged 50 to\n59 results in ICERs of \u00a312,539 and \u00a39,043, vaccinating\nonly those aged 60 to 69 results in ICERs of \u00a310,639 and\n\u00a39,742, and vaccinating all persons aged 65 and older\nresults in ICERS of \u00a314,385 and \u00a314,294, from a NHS and\nsocietal perspectives respectively. As productivity costs\nare limited to those aged less than 70 in the model, the\nNHS and societal perspective costs become identical\nafter this age threshold.\nThe cost-effectiveness of vaccinating single age groups\nwith comparable population size (10,000 people) was also\nperformed; however, as the model is structured to sup-\nport input data only to the detail of 5-year age bands, the\nanalysis of a single age group resulted in nearly identical\nICERs as that of the 5-year age group it falls within. For\nexample, if a vaccination strategy was applied to those\naged 66 only (a population size of 557,469), the ICERs\nwould be \u00a310,179 and \u00a39,938 for the NHS and societal\nperspectives, respectively. The ICER differs slightly from\nthat of the aged 65 to 69 ICER due to the slight difference\nin the gender ratio of this smaller population as well as\ndifferential mortality rates, utility values, employment\nrates, and incidence of HZ.\nSensitivity Analysis\nDeterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to\nassess scenario uncertainty in the model. The tornado\ndiagram in Figure 3 illustrates the difference from the\nbase case in the lifetime cost per QALY observed for a\nnumber of selected sensitivity analyses performed from a\nNHS perspective. Societal perspective results are not pre-\nsented, as the relative sensitivity of changes to this per-\nspective is similar to those from a NHS perspective.\nA number of analyses were performed to explore the\nuncertainty around the base case assumptions of vaccine\nefficacy, testing the applied point estimate and duration\nof vaccine efficacy. The lower and upper limit of the 95%\nconfidence interval of the vaccine efficacy obtained from\nthe Oxman trial were tested in the sensitivity analysis,\nindicating a moderate impact on the ICERs, i.e. an 8%\nincrease and a 12% decrease respectively. In addition, the\nbase case assumes that the efficacy of the vaccine is con-\nstant over the lifetime of the population, therefore an\nassumption of a limited duration of full vaccine efficacy\n(20 years and 10 years) followed by a lifetime of no effi-\ncacy was examined. As expected, the shorter durations of\nprotection have an adverse impact on the expected bene-\nfits of vaccination, resulting in higher ICERs of \u00a317,807\/\nQALY and \u00a332,809\/QALY gained respectively. Another\nsensitivity analysis assumed a 10-year duration of full\nvaccine efficacy and, in addition, that 50% of the remain-\ning healthy vaccinated population would receive a repeat\ndose after 10 years, which provided them with full life-\ntime efficacy. From the NHS perspective, the inclusion of\na repeat dose results in an ICER of \u00a324,511\/QALY. A final\nsensitivity analysis applied an 8.3% annual waning rate,\nreported by Pellissier et al. as the upper limit of the wan-\ning rate [15], from the first month following vaccination.\nThis resulted in an ICER of \u00a319,533\/QALY gained.\nDiscount rates of 0% and 6.0% for both costs and bene-\nfits, as well as a scenario of 3.5% for costs and 1.5% for\nbenefits were tested. Results were quite sensitive to the\nvalues chosen. Lower discount rates will decrease ICERs\nto a large degree. Higher discount rates tend to emphasise\nvaccination costs, which are not affected by discounting\nas they are incurred in the first year, while diminishing\nthe clinical benefits and cost savings achieved in subse-\nquent years.\nThe vaccine coverage rate applied in the base case anal-\nysis was the same across all age groups, i.e. 40%. The use\nMoore et al. Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation 2010, 8:7\nhttp:\/\/www.resource-allocation.com\/content\/8\/1\/7\nPage 10 of 14of differential coverage rates was explored, assuming that\ndifferent age groups are covered by the vaccine at differ-\nent rates, i.e. 60% of those aged 50-64, 30% of those aged\n65-84, and 10% for those over 85+ years. Under this\nassumption, the resulting ICER decreased to \u00a312,483.\nThe GPRD analysis provided information on HZ and\nPHN, covering the pain split as well as PHN duration\n[11]. A sensitivity analysis explored the effect of using\nGPRD data solely for all main HZ and PHN characteris-\ntics [11]. As can be seen in Table 1, the values are more\nconservative than the base case results. This is due pri-\nmarily to the decreased number of moderate and severe\npain cases of both HZ and PHN (compared to the SPS\npain split).\nSeveral sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess\nthe impact of disease-specific utility values on results.\nThree sources for utility weights were available for mild,\nmoderate, and severe pain associated with HZ and PHN.\nAlternative utility values, based on an HZ population,\nwere available from Bala et al. [29] and the SPS [15]. For\nboth of these alternative utility values, their associated\ndecrements were lower than those reported by Oster\n[13]. The difference is mainly found in the severe pain\nstate. Oster [13] reports a utility decrement from full\nhealth to HZ\/PHN with severe pain of 0.75 whereas the\nBala [29] and SPS [15] values imply that the decrement is\n0.53 and 0.45, respectively. Because the decrements from\nthe alternative studies are modest relative to the Oster\n[13] study, the total number of QALYs gained over the\nlifetime of vaccinated individuals is lower when using the\nBala [29] and SPS [15] utility values, resulting in\nincreased ICERs.\nSeveral sensitivity analyses had only a marginal effect\non results, i.e. the inclusion of HZ mortality [12], the\nassumption of no hospitalisation due to HZ\/PHN, the\nincrease of vaccine administration costs.\nProbabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed using\nMonte Carlo simulations (1,000 runs) on distributions for\nthose parameters described earlier. Due to the inclusion\nof a new variable, the vaccine waning rate, and also since\nsome means used for the sensitivity analysis differed from\ntheir corresponding base case value, the mean results of\nthe PSA are not identical to the base case results. The\nmean result after 1,000 runs maintained the cost-effec-\ntiveness of the vaccination strategy, with a mean ICER of\n\u00a319,551 (se: 58,922) for the NHS perspective. Figure 4A\nshows the NHS perspective for the outcome of QALYs\ngained. Presented in Figure 4B is the cost-effectiveness\nacceptability curve, providing the number of simulations\nwhich fall below given values or thresholds. The probabil-\nity of not surpassing the commonly used threshold of\n\u00a330,000\/QALY from a NHS perspective is 92.7%. There-\nfore, the PSA illustrates the robustness of the cost-effec-\ntiveness of the vaccination policy.\nDiscussion\nThe main results of this analysis, demonstrate numerous\nbenefits of a vaccination strategy. These benefits include\na reduced number of HZ and PHN cases, an increase in\nhealth-related quality of life as captured by the QALY, in\naddition to a reduction in hospitalisations, consultations\nand prescription costs for the vaccinated population.\nWhile sensitivity analyses illustrated that the model\nresults are sensitive to some inputs, the vast majority of\nscenarios resulted in ICERs well below the cost-effective-\nness thresholds commonly used in the UK [31].\nThis model takes into consideration a number of fac-\ntors which contribute to its robustness. First, the model is\npopulation-based and therefore of direct relevance to\ndecisions concerning vaccination, as this is done at the\npopulation-level. In addition, the model takes into\naccount the ageing of the population over the duration of\nthe model, adjusting for their mortality, the likelihood of\ncontracting HZ and PHN and the efficacy of the vaccine.\nThough it was assumed that the vaccine would have life-\ntime duration of efficacy, the model is able to accommo-\ndate any changes to vaccine durability. Also this model\nincorporates epidemiological data that were obtained\nfrom a very large dataset (GPRD) [11], these input\nparameters for the model could be considered robust and\nrepresentative of clinical practice in the UK.\nSimilar to other cost-effectiveness models, the main\nlimitations of this study relate to the uncertainty sur-\nrounding some parameter estimates used in this model.\nOne of these limitations concerns the assessment of dis-\nease severity in both HZ and PHN. The results of the\nseverity split in HZ and PHN is quite different when the\nSPS and GPRD data are compared. For the base case we\nTable 3: Base Case: Lifetime Results for the 50+ Age Group\nResults Lifetime horizon TPP Societal\nICERs Cost per QALY \u00a313,077 \u00a311,417\nCost per HZ Case Avoided \u00a31,440 \u00a31,258\nCost per PHN Case Avoided (1 \nmonth def)\n\u00a35,421 \u00a34,733\nCost per PHN Case Avoided (3 \nmonth def)\n\u00a35,453 \u00a34,761\nMoore et al.

Assessment of severity in\nGPRD was based on treatments prescribed [11] rather\nthan actual pain measured and therefore is expected to be\nless reliable than SPS data, where measurements were\ngeared to providing clinical benefits. Experts further con-\nfirmed that the majority of patients experience pain at\nHZ onset which confirms the higher validity of the SPS\ndata.\nFigure 2 Base Case ICERs by Age-Group.

[13] utilities, obtained in a\nPHN population, were selected for the base case due to\nthe focus on neuropathic pain. A recent publication\ninvestigating the quality of life in neuropathic pain\nreported utility weights of 0.67 for mild, 0.46 for moder-\nate and 0.16 for severe pain [25], indicating that the Oster\nvalues are appropriate for this study. In addition a recent\npublication by Van Hoek et al. [8] arrived at similar utility\nscores for the different pain states, i.e. 0.78, 0.61 and 0.27\nfor mild, moderate and severe pain respectively. In the\nstandard approach in economic evaluations, the utility\ngain from prevention is the utility that would otherwise\nbe lost due to illness. An extension of the standard utility\nmodel and analysis of prevention interventions is offered\nby the utility-in-anticipation concept introduced by\nCohen and Henderson [32]. This concept acknowledges\nthe fact that the utility resulting from preventive mea-\nsures such as vaccination follows immediately after vacci-\nnation until the time when the outcomes was expected.\nFurthermore this utility will depend on the anxiety asso-\nciated with both the perceived risk of infection and the\nperceived effectiveness of the vaccination in reducing\nthat risk. This model does not include any such gains and\ntherefore could underestimate the total utility gained\nfrom vaccination. Obviously, had this been included, this\nwould have resulted in lower ICERs.\nA 3.5% discount rate for both costs and benefits was\nused in the base case analysis as suggested by the current\nNational Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE) guidelines. A lower discount rate of 1.5% for out-\ncomes was selected in the sensitivity analysis to account\nfor the long-lasting effects of the vaccine, resulting in\nlower ICERs of \u00a39,893 per QALY gained for the third\nparty payer perspective. This reflects the previous guide-\nlines set by NICE, which recognised that differential dis-\ncounting is appropriate in certain cases [33]. This is\nbecause vaccination programmes accrue their cost in the\npresent but may not observe their benefits until the\nfuture. This can be seen in the case of the vaccine pre-\nventing HZ where those vaccinated may likely be in their\nearly 50s and 60s, but the incidence of HZ increases with\nage, thus the benefit of the vaccine may not be observed\nuntil the medium- to long-term. Discounting health ben-\nefits created by vaccines with long-term effects at the reg-\nular discount rates can negatively affect their true benefit\nby underestimating the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine\n[27].\nModelling the appropriate duration of vaccine efficacy\nis also a significant issue. Extensive SA were conducted to\nassess the impact of different duration of protection and\nshowed that the highest ICERs were obtained when\nassuming a 10-year duration of efficacy, or utilising a\nwaning rate. Most of the sensitivity analyses were still\nbelow \u00a330,000\/QALY.\nAnother limitation relates to the available vaccine effi-\ncacy data. Firstly, as the SPS trial did not include patients\naged 50 to 59, the model assumed that the efficacy values\nfor those aged 60 to 69 would be relevant for this younger\npopulation. Secondly, the SPS trial reported a 22% reduc-\ntion in pain for those developing HZ [6], which may con-\nsequently reduce the pain associated with PHN, but as\nthis effect was difficult to incorporate into the structure\nof the model as such, it was not taken into account\ndirectly.\nMost of the resource use data were also taken from\nGPRD [11]. Though we are confident that primary care\nresource use was accurately recorded, there is less cer-\ntainty over the secondary care data, as there were only a\nfew referrals or hospitalisations due to HZ or PHN. It is\npossible therefore that the estimated treatment costs\nwere underestimated. The underestimation of costs does\nhave the advantage that it does not favour the vaccine\narm and therefore represents a conservative approach. A\nsensitivity analysis which varied all health care costs 20%\nabove and below their base case value found that this had\nminimal impact on the ICERs. Furthermore, the model\nprovides a conservative estimate of the value of herpes\nzoster vaccination. By not incorporating the common\nocular and neurological complications (other than PHN)\nof HZ, including keratitis, iritis, retinal necrosis, [34]\nmeningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis, [35] due to current\nlack of available data, the model may underestimate the\npotential health benefits and cost savings resulting from\nvaccination. Therefore future analyses, in the form of\nadditional retrospective or prospective studies, would be\nof interest in order to model more accurately such poten-\ntial disease pathways following herpes zoster and their\nimpact on costs and quality of life.\nWith regards to a real-world vaccination strategy, it is\nworth nothing that the results presented in this analysis\nwould only apply for the first years of a vaccination pro-\ngramme where a \"catch-up\" programme would be insti-\ntuted for older patients. Following this period, a\nvaccination strategy would typically include younger\ncohorts (for instance, those aged 50-69) as other older\nadults will have already received the vaccine. As a result,\nin these later years, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination\nwould improve, as illustrated in this study by the lower\nICERs associated with relatively lower age groups.\nA health economic evaluation of the new live attenu-\nated vaccine against herpes zoster in England and Wales\nwas recently published by Van Hoek et al. [8] The Van\nHoek et al. model employs a different categorisation of\nHZ\/PHN pain states by including a state of clinically rele-\nvant pain (CRP) to characterize both moderate and\nsevere pain, while it assumes a limited duration of effi-\ncacy with the use of a waning rate,. In addition, there are\ndifferences in several input parameters such as HZ inci-\ndence rates, disease-specific utilities, and vaccine price\nMoore et al. Cost Effectiveness and Resource Allocation 2010, 8:7\nhttp:\/\/www.resource-allocation.com\/content\/8\/1\/7\nPage 13 of 14applied. Even though a direct comparison of the base case\nresults of the two analyses is not possible, the reported\nsensitivity analysis applying the maximum vaccine pro-\ntection duration (100 years) for the cohort aged 65 in the\nVan Hoek et al. study (\u00a35,660\/QALY), produced almost\nidentical results to our study (\u00a35,583\/QALY) when we set\nthe vaccine price and population size equal.\nIn addition, a previous model by Edmunds et al. [12]\nhad estimated the potential cost-effectiveness of vaccina-\ntion prior to the availability of data on the clinical efficacy\nof such a vaccine. Structurally, this previous model differs\nfrom ours due to a different and less detailed utilisation of\npain states and because it was not able to model the mul-\ntiple efficacies (direct and indirect) now known of the\nvaccine. Despite these differences, as well as the use of\nseveral input parameters which relied on secondary data,\nconsidering a cohort aged 65, the base case resulted in\nICERs of similar magnitude to our study, with values\nbelow \u00a310,000 per QALY gained from a NHS perspective.\nA third cost-effectiveness study by Pellissier et al. [15]\nhas been published in the US, and while results cannot be\ndirectly compared to the UK due to differences in epide-\nmiology and related health care costs, the general model\nstructure has many similarities to the current model.\nAge-specific and severity-specific data were considered\nwhere possible. Vaccine efficacy was modelled using sev-\neral dimensions, with both models allowing the use of a\nwaning rate (however neither of the two studies included\nthis feature in the base case analysis). In both studies, ret-\nrospective database analyses were performed to inform\neconomic inputs and the resulting ICERs were deter-\nmined to be cost-effective using locally accepted thresh-\nolds. Therefore, it confirms the robustness of the\nmethods used in this analysis.\nThere are a number of areas where additional research\ncould further improve the accuracy of the model. Contin-\nued validation of the duration of efficacy of the vaccine,\nas mentioned above, remains one of the key areas for\nresearch.\nConclusions\nThe main results of this cost-effectiveness analysis show\nthat a vaccination programme preventing HZ and PHN is\nlikely to lead to substantial health and economic benefits\nfor the UK. The model predicts that the most cost-effec-\ntive strategies for the NHS are to vaccinate people\nbetween 60-64 and 65-69 years (\u00a310,984 and \u00a310,275).\nBut beyond these age-groups, in most scenarios, the cost-\neffectiveness ratios remain below the commonly accepted\ncost-effectiveness threshold in the immunocompetent\npopulation aged 50 years and more.\nAdditional material\nCompeting interests\nVR and MB are employed by SPMSD who funded the study.
