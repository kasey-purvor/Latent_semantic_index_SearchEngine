This is a\nquantum interference effect, which occurs because the two possible paths where the photons\nleave in different output ports interfere destructively. This effect was first observed in para-\nmetric downconversion by Hong, Ou and Mandel 1, and then with single photons produced\none after the other by the same quantum emitter 2\u20135. With the recent development of quan-\ntum information, a lot of attention has been devoted to this coalescence effect as a resource\nfor quantum data processing using linear optics techniques 6\u201311. To ensure the scalability\nof schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that indistinguishable photons are emitted by\na collection of synchronized, but otherwise independent sources. In this paper, we demon-\nstrate the quantum interference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped\nsingle atoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many indistinguishable\nsingle photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows that the coalescence observed\nis mostly limited by the wavefront matching of the light emitted by the two atoms, and to a\nlesser extent by the motion of each atom in its own trap.\n1\nA basic requirement for most quantum computing schemes is the implementation of two-\nqubit quantum gates 12. If the qubits are encoded in single photons, the gate can be obtained\nby using an interference effect between the photons, followed by a measurement-induced state\nprojection 6. One may also use qubits encoded in solid-state systems such as quantum dots 13,\nor in atomic systems such as ions 14 or neutral atoms 15. One way to entangle the atomic qubits\nwithout direct interaction, and thus realise quantum gates, is to use them as single photon sources,\nso that the emitted photons are entangled with the internal states of the emitters. The interference\nof two photons emitted by such sources projects the state of the two atoms into an entangled\nstate 16. Many protocols based on this conditional entanglement have been proposed 10, 11, and\nexperimental work is under way to implement them 17. The photons involved in such schemes do\nnot need to be initially entangled, and can even be emitted by different sources 9, but they need to\nbe indistinguishable. However, it is generally not easy to have several (possibly many) independent\nsources emitting indistinguishable photons. With quantum dots in microcavities 2, 3, the dispersion\nin frequency associated with differences in fabrication is usually much too large for the photons to\nbe emitted at the same frequency. With atoms in cavities 4, each emitter is by itself a complicated\nexperiment, and cannot be easily multiplied. In this paper we address this problem by using two\nsingle atoms in two neighbouring traps emitting in free space, and we demonstrate that these atoms\ndo emit indistinguishable photons. This scheme can easily be scaled to arrays of traps 18.\nOur experiment uses two single rubidium 87 atoms, confined in separate optical dipole traps.\nThese traps are formed in the focal plane of the same high-numerical aperture lens, and loaded from\na cloud of cold atoms in an optical molasses 19. The two traps, each of which has a waist of 1\u00b5m,\n2\nare separated by a distance of 6\u00b5m. To obtain triggered single photon emission from the two atoms,\nwe simultaneously excite them with a high efficiency (> 95%) using a \u03c3+-polarised pulsed laser\nbeam which drives the F = 2, mF = 2 to F \u2032 = 3, m\u2032F = 3 closed transition 20. The quantization\naxis is defined by a magnetic field of several gauss. Both atoms are excited by the same short (less\nthan 4 ns) pi-pulse. Each one then spontaneously emits a single photon 21, with a lifetime of 26 ns.\nThe photons are collected by the same objective lens that is used to focus the dipole trap beams 19,\nand detected using a pair of avalanche photodiodes. Between the objective and the photodiodes, an\noptical setup composed of two half-wave plates and two polarizing beam splitter cubes (HWP1,2\nand PBS1,2) is inserted in the beam path (see Figure 1). It can be configured either as a 50\/50\nbeam splitter which mixes the light from the two atoms on each detector, or as a beam separator\nwhich sends the light from each atom to only one of the detectors. The avalanche photodiodes\nare connected to a high-resolution counting card in a start-stop configuration. This allows us to\nmeasure the number of coincident photodetections as a function of the delay between the arrival\ntimes of the two photons on the photodiodes, with a resolution of about 1.2 ns. In the 50\/50 beam\nsplitter configuration, the detectors cannot distinguish which atom has emitted a photon, and we\nexpect to observe the coalescence effect. In the beam separator configuration, each avalanche\nphotodiode only monitors the light emitted by one of the two atoms, and coincidence counts can\nonly be due to independent emissions by both atoms.\nThe measurements are performed by repeating the following procedure. First, we detect the\nsimultaneous presence of one atom in each trap in real time by measuring their fluorescence from\nthe molasses light used to load the traps. We then trigger a sequence that alternates a burst of\n3\n575 pulsed excitations, lasting 115\u00b5s, with a 885\u00b5s cooling period using the molasses light. This\nalternation is repeated 15 times before stopping and recapturing a new pair of atoms. During the\nexcitation periods, the pi-pulses irradiate both atoms every 200 ns, and the counting card accumu-\nlates the number of double detections produced by the two avalanche photodiodes. This sequence\nmaximizes the number of single photons that we can obtain before the two atoms are heated out\nof the trap 21. After the 15 bursts of pulsed excitations, we measured a probability of 65% to keep\neach atom in its trap. At the end of the sequence, we switch the molasses back on and wait on\naverage about 300 ms until we detect two atoms again. Two histograms are accumulated for the\nsame number of repetitions: one in the 50\/50 beam splitter configuration, and one in the beam\nseparator configuration.\nThe two histograms are shown in Figure 2, without background subtraction. Both histograms\nconsist of a series of peaks separated by 200 ns, the repetition period of the pulsed laser. The width\nof the peaks is determined by the 26 ns lifetime of the excited state. In the beam separator configu-\nration, all peaks are identical, and always correspond to a double detection with one photon coming\nfrom each atom. Hence, their height gives a natural calibration of the experiment. A histogram in\nthe 50\/50 beam splitter configuration can be normalised by dividing by the height of the peaks in\nits corresponding histogram measured in the beam separator configuration. The normalized signals\nthat are obtained are then independent of collection efficiency, detection efficiency and experiment\nduration, and allow histograms taken under different conditions to be compared. In the 50\/50 beam\nsplitter configuration, the peak at zero delay is clearly much smaller than the other peaks. As each\natom is a very good source of single photons 21, this peak also consists only of events where both\n4\natoms have emitted a photon. In contrast, the other peaks consist of events where two photons are\nsuccessively emitted, either by the same atom, or by both atoms. Since the peaks at non-zero delay\nare almost the same in both configurations, we can deduce that almost all registered counts are due\nto events where both atoms were present.\nIn the case of perfect coalescence, the peak at zero delay in the 50\/50 beam splitter configu-\nration would be absent: as the two photons leave via the same port, there can be no coincidences.\nWe attribute the residual peak that we observe in Figure 2 to an imperfect overlap of the spatial\nmodes of the two photons, which then do not interfere. To experimentally illustrate this effect, we\nvaried the overlap between the two modes in a controlled way by translating one beam relative to\nthe other (translation of the cut mirror CM, see figure 1). Figure 3 shows the normalized height\nR of the residual peak at zero delay, as a function of the separation between the two images. For\na given spatial overlap K between the amplitude of the two modes, the ratio R is expected to be\n(1\u2212K2)\/2 (see Methods section). The solid line is a gaussian fit based on the experimental value\nof the beam size in the image plane, and considering the maximal wavefront overlap Kmax as an\najustable parameter. The agreement with the coincidence data is very good, which confirms the\ncrucial role of good mode matching of the two beams in our experiment. We obtain from the fit\nthe maximum wavefront overlap Kmax = 0.78 \u00b1 0.03. This imperfect overlap is consistent with\nthe errors we measure on the beam positions and waists.\nFinally, we analyse the structure of the time spectrum around zero delay. The small peak at\nzero delay from Figure 2, is displayed on a larger scale in Figure 4. The dashed line correponds to\n5\na model where the wavepackets of the two photons are identical and arrive at the same time on the\nbeamsplitter, but with imperfect spatial overlap of the two beams. This curve does not correctly\nreproduce the experimental data: the experimental dots seem to sit on a slightly wider curve. Due\nto their finite temperature, the atoms move in the trapping potential and experience a range of\nlight-shifts. This changes their internal energy, and thus modifies the frequency of the emitted\nphoton. For two photons at different frequencies, the correlation signal would exhibit a beat note\nas already seen by Legero et al. 4. If the two photons now have a distribution of frequencies, the\ncorrelation signal consists of a beat note averaged out over this distribution. This gives rise to\na slightly broader structure for the signal, which is well fitted by the solid line predicted by our\nsimple model (see details in the Methods section).\nBy fitting the experimental data shown in Figure 4 with our model, we extract the overlap\nof the spatial modes K = 0.7 \u00b1 0.05 and the temperature of the atoms T = 180 \u00b1 20 \u00b5K. In a\nseparate experiment, we measured the temperature of the atoms in the dipole trap, which is initially\nclose to 120\u00b110\u00b5K. Each pulse followed by the spontaneous emission of the photon increases the\nenergy of the atom by one recoil. We calculate that after the first 115\u00b5sec of pulsed excitations the\ntemperature rises by 60\u00b5K, in good agreement with the temperature obtained from the fit above.\nWe also checked experimentally that each cooling period resets the temperature of the atom to its\ninitial value. A comparison of the fit with the dashed curve, which corresponds to zero temperature,\nconfirms that at present the imperfect interference is mainly due to the imperfect optical wavefront\nmatching, and not to the motion of the atoms in the traps.\n6\nIn conclusion, we have experimentally demonstrated the coalescence of two photons emitted\nby two independent trapped atoms. The contrast of the interference is limited by the overlap (in\nfree space) of the spatial modes of the fluorescence light emitted by the two atoms. By coupling\nthe light from each of the atoms into identical single-mode optical fibres, this overlap could be\ngreatly improved, though this may be at the cost of a reduced counting rate. The shape of the\nresidual signal around zero delay is well explained by a broadening due to the finite temperature of\nthe atoms in the trap. Better wavefront overlap and further cooling of the atoms will improve the\noverall quality of this interference and will make this system suitable as a resource for entangling\ntwo atoms.\nSupplementary Information is linked to the online version of the paper at www.nature.com\/nature.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge support from the European Union through the Integrated Project\n\u201cSCALA\u201d.

If fk(r)Ek(t) is the field emitted by the atom k (k = 1, 2),\nreference 22 shows that the probability to detect one photon at rA and to detect the other one at rB,\nin the 50\/50 beam splitter configuration, after a delay \u03c4 is proportional to\nw(2)(\u03c4, rA, rB) =\n\u222b\n|f1(rB)f2(rA)E1(t+ \u03c4)E2(t)\u2212 f2(rB)f1(rA)E2(t+ \u03c4)E1(t)|\n2 dt,\nwhich can be understood as the interference of two paths. Assuming a temporal form of the field\nEk(t) = H(t) e\n\u2212\u0393\n2\nt ei\u03c9kt where H(t) is the step function, we obtain\nw(2)(\u03c4) \u221d e\u2212\u0393|\u03c4 |(1\u2212K2 cos\u2206\u03c9 \u03c4 ),\nwhere K = |\n\u222b\ndr f \u22171 (r)f2(r)|\/\n\u221a\u222b\ndr |f1(r)|2 \u00d7\n\u222b\ndr |f2(r)|2 is the spatial overlap of the electric\nfield, and \u2206\u03c9 is the frequency difference between the two emitted photons. The double detection\nprobability for \u03c4 = 0 is proportional to (1 \u2212K2), and so is the normalised ratio R defined in the\ntext. The proportionality factor is determined in the absence of interferences (K = 0): in this case,\nthe two photons behave as distinguishable particles and have a probability of 1\/2 to leave the 50\/50\nbeam splitter through two different ports. Thus the normalised ratio R is (1\u2212K2)\/2.\nModel including the finite temperature of the atoms in the trap. To take into account the finite\ntemperature of the atoms in the trap, we integrate the expected signal for two photons interfering\nwith a frequency difference \u2206\u03c9 and a spatial overlap K (see section above), over the probability\ndistribution of frequency differences. To obtain this probability distribution, we solve the equations\nof motion for a thermal ensemble of single atoms in the trap, experiencing pulsed excitations during\n115\u00b5s, followed by a decay in a random direction. After each pulse, we calculate the lightshifts of\n8\nall the atoms in the ensemble. We repeat this for 575 pulses to obtain the distribution of lightshifts.\nThis distribution is found to be well represented by a function of the form U2e\u2212\n2U\nkBT . The value\nof \u2206\u03c9 is proportional to the difference in lightshifts experienced by the atoms when they emit the\nphotons. We then calculate the auto-correlation of the lightshift distribution to get the probability\ndistribution of \u2206\u03c9. By averaging over this distribution of lightshift differences, we obtain the\nnormalized coincidence rate signal as an analytical function with only two fitting parameters, the\nspatial overlap and the temperature of the atoms.\n1.

The two atoms are trapped in two dipole traps separated by 6\u00b5m,\nand they are excited by the same pulsed laser beam. The trap depth is 1.5 mK, and the trap fre-\nquency along the axis of the pulsed laser beam is 120 kHz. The emitted photons are collected by\nthe same lens that is used to create the dipole traps. The light from one of the traps is separated off\nusing a cut mirror (CM) placed close to the image plane of the objective. In the plane of the cut\nmirror, the spot corresponding to each trap has a waist of \u223c 90 \u00b5m, and the two images are sepa-\nrated by 500 \u00b5m. The half wave plate HWP1 is oriented such that, at PBS1, the light beams from\nthe two atoms are recombined into the same spatial mode, but with orthogonal polarizations. There\nare then two configurations to detect the photons: either the axis of the half-wave plate HWP2 is\nset so that the two orthogonal incident polarisations are equally mixed in each output of PBS2, as\nin a 50\/50 beam splitter, or the axis is set so that the polarisations are unchanged, and then PBS2\n12\n\u001c\u0017\u0017\n\u001b\u0017\u0017\n\u001a\u0017\u0017\n\u0019\u0017\u0017\n\u0018\u0017\u0017\n\u0017\n\u0014\u001b\u0017\u0017 \u0014\u0019\u0017\u0017 \u0017 \u0019\u0017\u0017 \u001b\u0017\u0017\n5\\\nTI\nLY\u0003\nVM\u0003\nJV\nPUJ\nPKL\nUJ\nLZ\n+LSH`\u0003\u000fUZ\u0010\n\u0017\n\u0017\u0015\u0019\n\u0017\u0015\u001b\n\u0017\u0015\u001d\n\u0018\u0015\u0017\n5V\nYT\nHSP\naL\nK\u0003Z\nPNU\nHS\u0017\u0015\u001f\nFigure 2: Histograms of the time delays of the arrival of two photons on the avalanche photodiodes,\nin the start-stop configuration.

The reason why it is 0.5 and not 1 can\nbe understood from the following argument. The normalised peak height, as described in the text,\nis simply the height of the peak in the beam splitter configuration divided by the height of the\npeak in the beam separator configuration, both taken at zero delay. At zero delay, a coincidence\nevent, whether in the beam splitter or beam separator configuration, always corresponds to the\ndetection of one photon from each atom. This is because both atoms are near perfect single photon\nsources, and therefore the probability that one of the atoms emits two photons during the same\nexcitation\/emission cycle, which would appears as a peak et zero delay, is negligible.\nThe difference between the two configurations is that in the beam separator configuration,\nwhere each photodiode sees the light from only one of the atoms, a pair of photons where one\nphoton comes from each atom always gives rise to a coincidence. In the beam splitter configura-\ntion, both of the photons can end up at the same photodiode, as each photodiode sees both atoms.\nIn this case, no coincidence occurs. For a 50-50 beamsplitter and distinguishable, non-interfering\nphotons, this happens 50% of the time. The same number of incident photon pairs therefore gives\n16\nrise to half as many concidences in this configuration and thus the ratio of the heights of the peak\nat zero delay in the two configurations is 0.5.\nB: ALIGNMENT OF THE OPTICAL SYSTEM AND LIMITS ON SPATIAL OVERLAP.\nIn order to overlap the spatial modes of the two single photons in free space, we used the fluores-\ncence signal of each of the two single atoms induced by the magneto-optical trap laser beams. We\nmeasured the beam positions and waist (1\/e2 radius) in two perpendicular directions and at two\npositions along the propagation axis by taking intensity profiles using razor blades. Using such\nprofiles, the angular and translational alignment were corrected step-by-step. This process was\nultimately limited by the error bars introduced by intensity fluctuations on the single atom signal.\nThe translational alignment (x and y) of the two spatial modes was further improved using the\ncontrast of the two-photon interference signal itself, as shown in figure 4.\nTo understand how possible alignment errors contribute to the spatial overlap, we have esti-\nmated how much the overlap changes in the following situations:\n1. The two beams have a different waist (different divergence).\n2. The two beams are displaced transversally (x and y).\n3. The position of the focal plane along the optical axis is different for the two beams.\n4. The two propagation axes have a small angle between them.\n17\nIn order to get an electric field mode overlap K > 0.8, one should achieve better than a\n4% error on each of these alignements, assuming that they are independent. As an example, if\nthe size of the waist of the two beams is different by 16%, which corresponds to our error bar on\nthe waist size, then the overlap K is already multiplied by 0.97. The cumulative effect of small\nalignment errors seems therefore a reasonable explanation for the limited spatial overlap that we\nobserve. However, it should be noted that phase errors across the wavefronts of the two beams due\nto aberrations of the optical system would also decrease the spatial overlap.\nC: THE EFFECT OF INHOMOGENEOUS BROADENING ON THE SHAPE OF THE\nRESIDUAL PEAK AT ZERO DELAY\nThe finite temperature of the atoms in the dipole traps gives rise to an inhomogeneous broadening\nof the spectrum of the photons emitted by the atoms. As described in our article, this broadening\nmanifests itself in our two-photon interference signal as an increase in the width of the residual\npeak at zero delay. The height of the residual peak, is not changed, and depends only on the spatial\noverlap of the two beams.\nIn the case of perfect spatial overlap, the peak would disappear at exactly zero delay. This\nis because if one looks close enough around zero delay, the wavepackets of the two photons look\nalike as dephasing due to their frequency difference has not had time to occur. In a sense, perfect\ntwo-photon interference always occurs, provided we look at \u201cshort enough\u201d timescales. This is\nequivalent to imposing temporal coherence by adding a narrow band filter. In the case of perfect\n18\nspatial overlap, our residual peak would have a \u201cdip\u201d at exactly zero delay, with the width of this\ndip depending on the inhomogeneous spectral width of the emitted photons. This effect has been\nobserved for two photons emitted by the same source [4], and the theory is detailled in ref [22].\nThe figure below summarizes this different configurations.\n19\n\u0013\u0011\u0015\u0018\n\u0013\u0011\u0015\u0013\n\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0018\n\u0013\u0011\u0014\u0013\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0013\n\u0010\u0014\u0013\u0013 \u0010\u0018\u0013 \u0013 \u0018\u0013 \u0014\u0013\u0013\n'HOD\\\u0003\u000bQV\f\n1R\nUP\nDOL\nVH\nG\u0003D\nPS\nOLWX\nGH\nFigure 5: Zoom of the histogram of Figure 2 in the 50\/50 beam splitter configuration, around zero\ndelay.
