If we\ncould crack this one, students would use the\nlibrary and the Web and get their assignments in\non time. They would come to our lectures and\ntutorials having prepared; they would ask\ninteresting and challenging questions; and we\nwould be able to reveal to them the excitement\nand charm of our chosen discipline. They would\nall pass everything, and the reputation of our\ninstitutions would increase. So does this book\nhave the answers?\nIt is divided into four sections, although the\nchapters do not always seem to fall obviously\ninto one group rather than another. The first\nsection, \"The impact of teaching on student\nmotivation', contains six chapters on curriculum\ndesign and teaching methods; there are useful\nreferences for those new to the area, although it\nis perhaps less stimulating than the later, more\nspecific, sections. The second group of six essays,\n'Motivating diverse students', makes greater use\nof psychological models of motivation, and\nconsiders the responses of different demographic\ngroups to the higher-education context. The\nthird section, \"The impact of university practices\non motivation', contains five chapters, three on\ncurriculum design (projects, work-based learn-\ning, and work experience) and two on more\n54\ngeneral issues: the impact of stress on student\nmotivation, and cultural attitudes towards\nlearning and teaching. This latter, 'Learning as\nan aesthetic practice: motivation through beauty\nin higher education' by Alan Bleakley, actually\nappears to belong in a different book. It is\npolemical in the midst of papen written in\ncooler experimental discourse, and laments the\nmechanistic, vocational culture which has\nreplaced the joy in learning shared by students\nand tutors in the fifteenth century. This paper\nbypasses the issues that others in the book <io\nattempt to address: how to protect the student's\nenjoyment of learning and the sanity of staff in\na mass system with ever-reducing funding.\nHowever, it does make the point that much of\nwhat is said about student motivation is already\nknown: that different students learn best in\ndifferent contexts, and those who are motivated\nby intrinsic factors tend to do better than those\nwho are motivated by extrinsic factors.\nThe value here of revisiting existing models of\nmotivation drawn from psychology or\nmanagement studies is that they highlight the\ncomplexity of students' motives in a system\nwhere it is not unusual to hear rather reductive\nassessments of students' failure (for example,\nbecause the students are perceived not to be very\nbright or to be lazy). This book reminds us of\nhow many factors are at play, and how diverse\nstudents are in their reasons for being in higher\neducation and their reasons for learning.\nThe final section deals with the impact of assess-\nment on student motivation, and emphasizes the\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\ncentrality of assessment to student behaviour\n'[. . .] it seems reasonable .to conclude that\nstudents are primarily influenced by the\nassessment system and that individual lecturers\nhave only a limited effect' (Newstead, p. 198).\nSo for the lecturer who might come looking for a\nquick-fix solution, there appear sadly to be no\neasy answers. However, the case studies and\nmodels presented here would be a good starting\nplace for anyone thinking of reviewing\ncurriculum and assessment practices in order to\nenhance the motivation of students.\nSh\u00e2n Wareing, University of Wales College,\nNewport\nOrtrun Zuber-Skerritt and Yoni Ryan (eds.),\nQuality in Postgraduate Education, London:\nKogan Page, 1994. ISBN: 0-7494-1413-8.\nPaperback, 177 pages. \u00a314.95.\nThe issue of quality has been a consistent, if\nproblematic, theme in higher education globally\nthroughout the 1990s. As we enter the next\nmillennium, it seems unlikely that there will be\ngenuine consensus in UK higher education\nabout what quality is, and how 'it' might best be\nfacilitated - a view only partly supported by the\neditors of this book who suggest that the term\nquality 'has a generally understood meaning, but\n[...] is very difficult to define' (page 1). As Roger\nHolmes suggests in his introduction to the book:\n\"The major beneficiaries of a well-run quality\nassurance system in higher education are the\nstudents and graduates' (page xi). But in this\nperspective 'quality' appears to be something\nthat happens to the student. It is the set of\nsystems, procedures, benchmarks and the like,\nwhich underpin educational delivery. In the\ncontext of research-student supervision 'quality'\ntends to mean 'quality assurance measures'\nwhich support the process of supervision. Given\nthis, for Holmes the book is:\n[. . .] very timely and appropriate, in the light\nof the increased awareness and implementa-\ntion of quality assurance principles and\npractices, and the central position of research\npostgraduate training programmes within\nuniversities. The book will assist universities,\nfaculties, departments and schools, as well as\nindividual supervisors, in improving the\nquality and effectiveness of research post-\ngraduate training and supervision respons-\nibilities, (page xi)\nThere are, of course, other, competing, defini-\ntions of quality. In a book published in 1991\n(Delivering Quality in Vocational Education,\nLondon: Kogan Page), Dave M\u00fcller and I\nsuggested that quality might most usefully be\nperceived in terms of the transformatory process\nby which individual learners increasingly take\nownership of their own learning. This notion\nmay not be fully convergent with the current\nstandards Zeitgeist of the Quality Assurance\nAgency, but it does open up interesting debates\nabout the purpose of postgraduate study, and its\nbenefits to the learner in a policy context\nadvocating lifelong learning. Not least, it\nproblematizes notions of standardization and\ncomparability of level and achievement in higher\neducation. As such it makes 'quality' an ex-\nplicitly subjective concept.\nAspects of this debate permeate this book.\nWritten primarily as a guide for those super-\nvising postgraduate students, it draws heavily on\nAustralian and UK case-study experience to\noffer both organizational systems and pedagogic\napproaches to improve research supervision. The\nbook is divided into two parts. Part 1 consists of\nsix short chapters exploring issues of quality and\ninstitutional research culture. On offer is a\ndiverse range of topics, from institutional\nplanning to best support research students, to\nissues of gender and postgraduate supervision\nand the particular challenges of supervising\n'overseas' students. Each chapter is separately\nauthored with the majority based on experience\nin Australian higher education during the early\n1990s. As with all texts of this kind, there is\nmuch to gain from the professional insights of\nothers in the field. However, the brevity of each\nchapter tends to encourage an uncritical\ndescriptive account of the topic rather than one\nthat effectively evaluates the impact of the\nactions or suggestions presented on service\nquality. This is most explicit in Jan Whittle's\ninteresting description of an institutional model\nfor managing research degree supervision in\nwhich she honestly concludes:\nSystematic evaluation of the policy\nframework, organizational support, and staff\ndevelopment programmes discussed . . . form\nan essential aspect of the University of South\nAustralia's quality control of the management\nof research degree supervision. At the time of\nwriting... it was too early to comment on the\neffectiveness of these new initiatives [. . .].\n(page 48)\n55\nReviews\nPart 2 follows a similar format. Eight chapters\nare grouped under the heading Educational Pro-\ncesses to Achieve Quality, compressed into 100\npages. The checklists and advice offered in this\npart of the book will be of value to those new to\nstudent supervision. Indeed a number of the\nchapters will be of interest for those supervising\nLevel 3 undergraduate research or similar-level\nprofessional courses, particularly Robert\nBrown's chapter on managing writing, and\nEstelle Phillip's chapter on avoiding communica-\ntions breakdowns between the supervisor and\nthe student. A couple of the other chapters aie\nless effective in delivering a clear link between\nwhat they have to say and the thorny concept of\nquality. The final chapter addresses the key issue\nof power in supervision and, less explicitly here\nbut potentially more importantly, summative\nassessment:\nUnderstanding power to be both structural\n[...] and relational seems to be important for\nunderstanding the issues of concern in\nsupervision, especially those of poor com-\nmunication: there is the material reality of the\nsupervisor's more powerful structural position\nand the way this position can be used [...]. We\nhave heard too many stories of the abuse of\npower [...] to be able to discount its operation\nand effectiveness. Yet at the same time we can\nd\u00e9centre sovereign power because [...] super-\nvisory power is neither complete, nor is it\nunmediated by students: both the student and\nthe supervisor are acting subjects who may act\non the actions of the other, (page 168)\nThe authors of this chapter go on to offer an\nexample of guidelines for supervision based on\nexperience at the University of Auckland. The\nnegotiated elements of these guidelines will be\nfamiliar territory for those with experience of\nindependent study approaches or learner-\ncontract-learning. Equally familiar will be the\nAlthusserian assertion that these forms of\nnegotiation offer sites for resistance 'to the\nhistorically reproduced power relationships that\nare dominant in conventional universities' (page '\n176).\nQuality in Postgraduate Education offers a range\nof advice and insight into the complex process of\nresearch-student supervision. It also touches on\na range of associated issues that impact on\nstudent performance and the power relation-\nships that exist between supervisors and\nstudents. As with many edited books of this\nkind, the writing is occasionally uneven and too\n56\nheavily based on descriptive case studies. None\nthe less, the text offers a number of useful\ninsights that will be of particular interest to\nthose new to postgraduate student supervision.\nPeter Funnell, University College Suffolk\nEta de Cicco, Mike Farmer and James Hargrave,\nUsing the Internet in Secondary Schools, London:\nKogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2522-9.\nPaperback, 154 pages. \u00a315.99.\nThere is no escaping the current explosion in\ncommunications technologies across the entire\neducation sector. Most readers will be affected\nby the resulting impact in their own HE and FE\ninstitutions, and could understandably by-pass a\nbook with a title such as this one as irrelevant.\nBut hold on a minute. We claim to be entering an\nage of lifelong learning, where the educational\nneeds of everyone, irrespective of age and\nbackground, are recognized. If we accept that\nthere is (or at very least aspire to) a learning\ncontinuum where age need not define the nature\nof provision, it stands to reason that the\npotential of the Internet as an educational tool\nshould be of interest to all. In this respect this\nbook represents a timely and very welcome\naddition to the plethora of related titles,\npreviously aimed largely at educators working in\ntertiary education. Our government is\nencouraging greater use of the Internet within\nschools, and this book should find a ready-made\naudience.\nThe brief descriptions of all three authors on the\nrear cover serve to alert the reader to the fact\nthat the book should stand out from the crowd.\nEta de Cicco works for the British Educational\nCommunications and Technology Agency\n(BECTA) which continues to play a central role\nin the effective uptake of information and\ncommunications technologies within schools.\nMike Farmer and James Hargrave both work in\nHE but claim experience in supporting learners\nof all ages in the use of the Internet. While only\n150 pages long, their book successfully manages\nto introduce the skills required to access and\ncontribute to the World Wide Web as well as\nacknowledging a range of curriculum areas that\nmight be facilitated through online activities.\nThe book is divided into two parts of similar\nsize. Successive chapters in Part 1 provide tips\nfor using, searching and designing for the Web,\nas well as a brief overview of other useful tools.\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 3\nPart 2 discusses practical examples of ways in\nwhich the Internet can be used to support\nlearning in specific areas of the secondary-\nschool curriculum at Key Stages 3 and 4.\nThe authors deserve credit for providing broad\ncoverage of all of these topics in a way that\nshould be both enlightening to the uninitiated\nyet engaging enough to hold the interest of more\nexperienced readers. This is partly due to the\nliberal reference to Web links which entice the\nreader to go online - my copy of the book has\naccumulated plenty of bent page corners\nopposite URLs deserving further investigation. I\nwonder if the authors or their publishers\nconsidered the increasingly popular practice of\nproviding a dedicated Web site to complement\nthe book by offering more convenient access to\nthe many links they recommend? If not, they\nought to have done.\nThe authors succeed, then, in providing a worthy\nintroduction to the Internet as a learning\nresource, but the fact that the book was\nobviously intended to be an introductory text\nperhaps underlies its greatest weakness. The\ndepth of detail that can be provided within 150\npages is limited. Some topics receive greater\nattention than others - perhaps this is a\nconsequence of the way the book was written\nand subsequently compiled from the efforts of\nseveral authors. For example, a whole chapter\n(18 pages) is devoted to tips on searching the\nWeb, while email is relegated to only six pages.\nEmail may not arouse as much popular interest\nas surfing the Web, nor indeed prove as\neducationally useful (I do appreciate that some\nwould disagree), but it does deserve greater\nrecognition and description in a book of this\nkind. Furthermore 'closed conferencing'\noccupies one page, UseNet occupies two, and\nIRC follows up the rear filling a meagre half a\npage. This imbalance only serves to reinforce the\npopular misconception that the Web is the\nInternet - in this respect, this part of the book\nmight make one think that it might more\nfittingly be called Using the World Wide Web in\nSecondary Schools.\nPart 2 acts as a guide to using the Internet for\nteaching in the following areas: Science (Physics,\nChemistry and Biology), Mathematics, English,\nGeography, History, Design and Technology,\nModern Languages, Music, Art and Religious\nEducation. Most topics are well researched, and\nthe authors have provided real resources for use\nin real classrooms. Each activity typically\nincludes useful teacher notes and pupil activity\nsheets. However, I am not sure how the book's\ncharming Copyright notice - 'Yours to have and\nto hold, but not to copy' - will affect the use of\nthese printed resources. Fortunately, the\nrecommended activities often encourage the\npupils to exploit different aspects of the Internet\nby searching the Web, downloading files,\nemailing information providers, and even\nconstructing basic Web pages. My only concern\nis that nothing stands still on the Web and,\nprobably sooner rather than later, the multitude\nof interesting URLs referred to throughout the\nbook will change.\nBut this book does represents a useful resource.\nIt is not particularly cheap for its length, but\nthen it obviously represents the distillation of\nconsiderable expertise, knowledge and experi-\nence. It should find,a place on the desks of all\nteachers, not only those with an interest in or\nresponsibility for IT, and not only those engaged\nin secondary-school education. Hopefully, its\ndeserving popularity will facilitate further\nrefinement of future editions and the regular\nupdating of content.\nBrian Boullier, University of Bradford\nLeslie Rae, Using Presentations in Training and\nDevelopment, London: Kogan Page, 1997. ISBN:\n0-7494-2423-0. Paperback, 218 pages. \u00a319.99.\nThis book claims to cover 'every aspect of the\nuse of presentations in all types of training and\ndevelopment programmes'. As the author is a\nmanagement and training consultant, the book\nis aimed more at those who need to make\npresentations in a business setting as opposed to\nthe academic world. That said, most of the\ninformation will be relevant to those making any\nkind of presentation, and could certainly help a\nnovice think through the approach to use in\norder to convey information more effectively. It\ncould also be relevant to students asked to make\na presentation assessed as part of their course-\nwork.\nThe book contains an introduction, 11 main\nchapters, and an appendix with a flowchart of\nthe process to follow in developing a presenta-\ntion, a brief bibliography and a resource list. At\nthe start of each chapter is a list of key points,\nand within chapters are boxed summaries of the\nadvice given. Many chapters also contain\nsuggested activities, designed to help the\npresenter think through the issues involved. The\n57\nReviews\nlayout of the book is relatively clear, and\nstructured to allow readers to dip in selectively if\nthey wish.\nThe introduction acknowledges the fear that\nhaving to give a presentation can induce, offering\nthe possibility, with practice, of learning the\ntechniques for a good presentation. It then\ndescribes the presentation layout of the book.\nThe first chapter outlines what must be\nconsidered before embarking on planning a\npresentation. Two chapters follow this detailing\nthe planning stages, taking into account the\noptions in methods of presentation and, once an\napproach has been determined, how to fill this\nout to a complete plan. The fourth chapter\ncovers the preparation needed to ensure that\nyour presentation runs smoothly, in terms of\nknowing your audience size, room layout and\nguaranteeing that any equipment needed is\navailable. Chapters 5 and 6 explore the types of\nvisual aid that can be used, their preparation and\neffective use. Chapter 7, entitled Personal\nPresentation, covers how to select a suitable\nwardrobe in order to make the right impression\non your audience.\nThe next chapters deal with the presentation\nitself. Chapter 8 goes through what the audience\nsees, how to ensure you are ready to start the\npresentation, how to deal with nervousness, how\nto open the presentation to gain your audience's\nattention, and how to set an appropriate mood.\nChapter 9 deals with making sure you get your\nmessage across, including, details such as your\nposture and the use of your voice, controlling\nyour own mannerisms, and how to make your\ncase effectively. Special attention is given to how\nto end a presentation in a positive manner which\nis likely to prompt questions, and Chapter 10\ndiscusses how to handle such questions,\nincluding suggestions on how to deal with\ndifficult questions and difficult people. The\nchapter finally progresses to making an assess-\nment of your own performance to feed back into\nfuture presentations. The final main chapter\ngives tips on practising presentations, and how\nto assist a novice presenter to learn the necessary\nskills.\nI found the overall approach of the book to be\nhelpful, providing simple ideas and reassurance\nwithout being patronizing. The lists of key\npoints will provide a useful reminder for some-\none working through the process of planning a\npresentation whether as an experienced or first-\ntime presenter. The suggested activities may help\n58\nto build confidence, although many of these are\ngroup activities, presupposing that a training\ncourse or group exists to provide support.\nIf you are an experienced presenter who has\npreviously considered the quality and scope of\nyour presentations, you will probably find no\nnovel ideas or suggestions in the book. The\nmaterial covered is largely standard advice with\nwhich many will be familiar. However, as the\nstructure of this book allows you to dip in as\nneeded, it could well provide a useful refresher\ncourse even for experienced presenters who feel\nthe need to brush up on their skills. For the\nnovice or nervous presenter it provides a step-by-\nstep guide to producing a coherent, well-received\ntalk, and should serve to boost confidence. And\nwhile there may be no totally new ideas in the\nbook, all of the relevant information I could\nthink of has been covered. I found it clear,\nreadable and in itself well presented, and it could\nprove a valuable resource for both teaching and\nlearning presentation skills.\nHeather Dalgleish, Loughborough University\nR. Hudson, S. Maslin-Prothero and L. Oates\n(eds.), Flexible Learning in Action: Case Studies\nin Higher Education, London: Kogan Page, 1997.\nISBN: 0-7494-2391-9. Paperback, 197 pages,\n\u00a318.99.\nThis is a book that is full of good ideas which\nillustrate the diversity of approaches to flexible\nlearning in many subjects and at all levels in\nhigher education. It is part of Kogan Page's Staff\nand Educational Development Series, and is a\ncollection of case studies contributed by\nmembers of three electronic discussion groups\nrepresenting the UK, Australia and the USA.\n'Flexible learning' has a plethora of definitions.\nIn their introduction, the editors establish the\ncontext by stating that for them it is 'student-\ncentred learning, and is about meeting student\nneeds using whatever methods of teaching and\nlearning are most appropriate'. In response to\ntheir brief, contributors have fleshed out this\ndefinition by describing initiatives that improve\naccess for students, give them control over what\nand how they learn, enable them to take respons-\nibility for learning, and provide appropriate\nsupport. Not surprisingly, the main drivers for\nthese initiatives included a desire to improve\nquality of learning, increasing student diversity,\nequal opportunities and access, labour market\ndemands for life-long learners, development of\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\ntransferable skills for employment, and\/or\nfunding constraints.\nEach case study comprises one of 31 brief\nchapters which are grouped into four main\nsections dealing with flexibility for campus-\nbased learners (1), work-based learners (2), skills\ndevelopment (3), and institutional strategies for\nsupporting flexible learning (4). Each section\nbegins with a brief introduction which summar-\nizes the common elements within the group, and\nthe innovative aspects of each study. These\nintroductions are a useful overview and a tool to\nselect chapters of particular interest. The book\nfinishes with a short conclusion which identifies\nthe current trends in provision of flexible\nlearning emerging from all the case studies.\nAll the initiatives described in Section 1,\n'Flexibility for learners on campus', are at\nmodular or unit level with changes aimed\nprimarily at responding to students' needs and\nimproving their learning. This is often done by\nusing resources such as interactive texts and\nworkbooks, video, aural packages, Web-based\nmaterials and multimedia, with the aim of\nimproving students' independence and learning\nskills. The move towards electronic provision is\nsignalled by several of the studies, such as\nmodules entirely delivered by email (Smith;\nFulkerth) and a framework for students to\nengage in case-based problem-solving, research\nand discussion through a networked learning\nenvironment (Buckner and Davenport). All the\ncontributors stress the crucial importance of\nsupporting flexible learners; two interesting\nexamples are the use of learning journals and\ngroup discussions to improve and share learning\nstrategies (M\u00fchlhaus and L\u00f6schmann), and\npeer-assisted study sessions (Witherby).\nThe case studies in Section 2, 'Flexibility for\nwork-based learners', describe work with\nemployers and professional bodies to tailor\ncurriculum and course design to meet the needs\nof those in work. Programmes of this nature\nallow student ownership of learning, but need\nrelevant outcomes, relevant and student-centred\nassessment strategies, and peer and institutional\nsupport mechanisms. Although some studies are\nabout development of distance-learning courses,\nmore value has been placed on opportunities for\nreflection in course design (Oldroyd). McArdle\nand McGowan discuss a real paradigm shift in\ncourse design to one of effective practice rather\nthan content, a fundamental change in\nphilosophy - which encourages action research\nand reflective practice. In another bold move,\nnurses have implemented a module in which\noutcomes, level of study, methods for achieving\noutcomes and assessment mode are all\nnegotiated with the student (Shipway) - surely\nthe ultimate in flexibility.\nThe chapters in Section 3 describe 'Flexible\napproaches to skills development' as universities\nrespond to pressure for development of students'\nskills for lifelong application. One broad-based\neffort to incorporate skills development into the\ncurriculum involves the production of generic\nskills packs for use by tutors in their classes in\nany subject (Bingham and Drew). In a unique\nproject, an institution has linked with com-\nmunity educators to provide for disadvantaged\nstudents without traditional entry qualifications\nby creating transitional modules, student\nmentoring, staff development and support for\npersonal development (Denning). Ure describes\na project to build confidence and core skills of\nnon-traditional entrants by profiling and\npersonal development planning. Macauley and\nPagnucci tell of a team-based, project-centred\napproach to teaching writing for purpose but\nwhich develops teamwork, evaluation skills, time \u2022\nmanagement, leadership, organizational skills,\nresearch and independence; most importantly,\nthe change from traditional delivery has resulted\nin busy, energetic student-driven learning\nactivity. Other initiatives include development of\nnumeracy (Cock and Pickard), library skills\n(Bainbridge) and research skills (Steward ).\nI found Section 4, 'Institutional strategies for\nsupporting flexible learning', the most interest-\ning since it illustrates that some institutions are\nthinking positively and constructively about\nmeeting the challenges of flexible learning. The\nfirst chapter in this section makes clear that\nuniversities must think carefully about struc-\ntures, support, administration and curriculum\nplanning to meet future needs in delivering\nflexible and distance learning (Lynch). McGhee\nfurther illustrates that management of flexible\nlearning must be incorporated into the routine\noperational, contractual, administrative and\nbudgetary activities of an institution including\nchanges to delivery of lectures and tutorials,\ndeployment of staff, contracts and appraisal. In\na' similar move to improve performance of all\nstaff and students, one university provides an\nOpen Access Student Information Service\n(OASIS) and has plans to put all documents and\ncourse materials into electronic form (Barker).\nOther strategic decisions include a sensible\n59\nReviews\nsolution to mixed-mode learning by purchasing\nmaterials from elsewhere (Fallows), a\nconsideration of the role of libraries in distance\neducation (Cavanagh) and a programme of staff\ndevelopment to support flexible learners\n(Robinson). The final two chapters describe\nsystematic plans to increase flexible learning by\nworking from vision to policy to implementation\nand development of a supporting infrastructure\n(Anderson; Wade).\nLike many other Kogan Page books, this one\nwill appeal to readers looking for a new idea or a\nsolution to a problem; it is a book well formatted\nfor 'dipping into'. With a broad coverage of\ninitiatives at different institutional levels, it\nshould be useful for teachers and administrators,\nbut especially for staff developers. My main\nquestion, however, is why are contributors only\nfrom three countries, and what are we missing?\nKate Morss, Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh\nAdam Warren, David Brunner, Pat Maier and Liz\nBarnett, Technology in Teaching and Learning:\nAn Introductory Guide, London: Kogan Page,\n1998.

Paperback, 132 pages. \u00a319.99.\nTechnology in Teaching and Learning: An\nIntroductory Guide and its companion Using\nTechnology in Teaching and Learning come from\nthe School of Education at the University of\nSouthampton. They should be associated in the\nreader's mind with the very successful computer-\nbased learning environment MicroCosm. The\nbooks appeared originally as an output from a\nTLTP project (Technology in Teaching and\nLearning: A Guide for Academics). There is a\nseparate video which provides case studies; this\nis not reviewed here.\nWhat do the authors have to say to us? How\nuseful would it be for a learning technologist to\nhave these companion volumes on his or her\nbookshelf ?\nBefore I give an answer to those questions, it is\nimportant to clarify the authors' use of the term\ntechnology. They use it to mean three things.\nFirst, the artefacts of technology: computers,\netc. Secondly, the applications and systems they\nsupport, e.g. Web browsers. Thirdly, an analysis\nof teaching and learning in higher education.\nThe mixture of teaching, learning and techno-\nlogy is the mix we should expect from such\nbooks. Without a consideration of what we do\nas teachers and how our students come to better\nunderstand subject knowledge as a result of\nusing all the adjuncts of information technology,\nwe would not be learning technologists. A\nknowledge of the artefacts of technology, on its\nown, is sterile. The modern university teacher\nhas to have a grasp of so many ideas and skills,\nin addition to his or her own subject expertise,\nthat one wonders how anyone keeps up to date in\ntheir discipline, let alone in learning technology.\nThese books require the serious reader to reflect\non his or her own 'level of technology capab-\nility'. The self-assessment is valid, inasmuch as it\ngets the reader reflecting on interests, skills and\ncompetencies. Such self-assessments are not a\nreliable or valid prediction of competence -\nrather they start the reader reflecting, that is,\nthinking about the ideas and concepts. It is\nimportant for teachers to become aware of\nlearning technology, whatever it might be.\nThinking leads to self-awareness. Self-awareness\nis a component of self-efficacy, and this in turn\nis a major component in self-regulation. Self-\nregulation is that system process that ensures\ncompetent teachers have the right skills at the\nright level at the right time. The self-assessment\ntests engage the reader in thinking: not a bad\nthing for any teacher!\nWhat about the layout of the books and their\nusability? They use icons to cue the reader with\nactivities, important points, warnings etc. The\ndesign of each page is well thought out, with an\neasy typographic style and appropriate screen-\nshots, tables, summary boxes and so forth. I\nparticularly liked the familiar applications that\nare used to explain computer communications,\nsuch as WinQVT, Eudora, Generic Telnet and\nNetscape. The authenticity provided by such\nfamiliar tools is important, as it reassures readers\nthat the tools they require are easily available and\nprobably on their office computer. The use of\nquestions such as 'What does the Internet have to\noffer?' gets readers engaged in thinking about\nwhat to do and what they already know.\nAnd I like books that have questions (a good\ntrick when reading is to look for explicit ques-\ntions or to invent for oneself an implicit ques-\ntion). These books provide good focused\nquestions that make the reader think. Authentic\nexamples with simple tasks are important in\nmaintaining interest and improving competence.\n60\nAn-J Volume 6 Number 3\nKeeping up to date with Internet communica-\ntion is an almost impossible task. The advice on\nHTML and browsers in these books is now a bit\nout of date, but the example links provided will\ngive the inquisitive reader a good starting point\nto find out, for example, how to put math-\nematical equations in a Netscape browser. Where\nwould you - the reader of this review - find out\nabout how to insert a square root function in a\nWeb page if your students were using Netscape\n4? I tested a few of the URLs to see if they still\nexist - a common problem with such books is\nthat example URLs often disappear before the\nbook is printed. Such is the progress in providing\nWeb pages and the uncontrolled nature of the\nInternet. I tried four URLs and was successful in\nthree. Not - 1 hasten to add - an overall 75 per\ncent success rate, rather an indication of the\ntransient nature of URLs and the vagaries of\nWeb servers, based on a small sample.1\nIn the volume Using Technology, there is a\nvaliant effort to get readers to think seriously\nabout how to do something about improving the\nlearning experience of their students. A lot of\nuse is made of graphics and tables with ratings\nof 'effort' in terms of a five-point box scale. This\nlooks very nice, but it is a bit 'Janet and John' in\nits simplicity. Another criticism is that the books\ndo not have an Index. So, if a reader wanted to\nknow what a URL is and what it signifies, it\nwould mean scanning through both books\nbefore finding a definition, but not an\nexplanation.\nTo answer my question about the use of these\nbooks on my bookshelf, I would say quite useful.\nI consider myself fairly familiar with the\ntechnology and the pedagogic theory. I have\nbeen reminded of things I knew (not a bad\nthing), and had to think again about what I\nmight do with computers, and what is teaching,\nand how does learning occur, and . . . The books\ndo encourage finding out about what is available.\nOne has to get on to a computer and try a few\nthings, as well as thinking seriously and deeply\nabout learning. In that sense the books are really\nuseful They activate the reader and encourage\nexperimentation and - I have to say - failure.\nMy failures were instructive and therefore I\ncannot really complain. In fact, the books\nencouraged me sufficiently to try out some tools,\nand helped me think about what I could do. My\nreservations above are about the validity and\nreliability of the self-assessment tests. I do not\nthink I am prepared to admit I am 'professional'\nin how I feel about technology in my lectures,\nneither am I 'cynical'. The self-assessment did\nmake me think about, if not confront, my\nfeelings.\nThe books have plenty of references to other\nsources, books as well as Internet resources. So,\ncan you - reader - find out how to put\nmathematical functions in a Netscape 4 browser?\nDo you know how students learn basic IT skills?\nHow can you cache Web pages to minimize costs\nto your department or cost centre? There are still\nplenty of questions to be answered and more\nbooks - like these - to be written.\nRay McAleese, Heriot-Watt University\nNote\n1 The offending URL is actually at Heriot-Watt Uni-\nversity on a server I use.\nJack Kessler, Internet Digital Libraries: The\nInternational Dimension, Artech Boston, USA:\nHouse Publishers, 1996.

This book-\nbased metaphor is now being strongly reinforced\nby the growing number of digital library systems\nthat are becoming accessible through the\nInternet. Such library systems form the focus for\nthe contents of this book.\nIts 22 chapters are organized into four basic\nsections:\n\u2022 Setting the stage (Part 1)\n\u2022 Specifics-National (Part 2)\n\u2022 Specifics - International (Part 3)\n\u2022 Generalities (Part 4).\nFour appendices, a glossary, subject index and\nannotated bibliography are also provided.\nPart 1 of the book is the shortest. Its three\nconcise chapters provide various items of\nbackground information intended to help\nreaders understand subsequent parts of the\nbook. Essentially, this section sets the scene by\npresenting some historical sketches that describe\nthe rapid development of the Internet (through\nits commercialization), the availability of\ndifferent sorts of online digital information, and,\nmore importantly, the evolution of digital\n61\nReviews\nlibraries themselves. According to the author (p.\n22) 'digital libraries were born in the United\nStates in the 1980s'. However, important con-\ntributions from other countries are acknow-\nledged and subsequently discussed in later parts\nof the book.\nPart 2 is by far the longest. It employs an\n'inductive and international' approach in order\nto attempt to reconcile an important concern of\nonline digital information providers and\nlibrarians - that is, access to electronic informa-\ntion in textual, pictorial and sonic forms. The 11\nchapters that make up this part of the book\nexplore specific digital-library initiatives in\nselected countries. For example, Chapter 4\ndescribes the flexible centralized approach to\ndigital information provision used in France\n(through the use of Minitel and the World Wide\nWeb), while Chapter 5 outlines the more rigid\ncentralized mechanism used in Singapore.\nSubsequent chapters cover activity in China,\nIndia, Australia, Thailand, the UK, Hungary,\nJapan, Indonesia and, of course, the USA.\nNaturally, the Internet and the Web are\nfundamental 'ingredients' in the activity taking\nplace in each of these countries.\nThe five chapters of the third section of the\nbook cover various cross-boundary topics such\nas language, politics and political structures,\ntechnical standards, business and international\norganizations. The section begins with a\ndiscussion of the diversity and complexity of the\nmany human languages, and the problems (such\nas cost) that they pose for online information\nstorage and access using computers. Following\nthe political ramifications presented in Chapter\n16, the next chapter provides a discussion of the\nneed for international technical standards. It\noutlines the importance and limitations of some\nof current standards, such as ISO 9660 (for CD-\nROMs), ISO 8879 (SGML) and the various\nmembers of the Z39 series of standards. Chapter\n18 deals with business issues; here the author\nclaims (p. 173) that: 'The growth engine of the\nInternet for now is the commercial firm, not the\ngovernment agency'. He then goes on to ponder\non how the US-driven 'profit, return-on-invest-\nment, money' rationale will scale internationally\nwithin the context of online-information pro-\nvision and digital-library development. The final\nchapter in this section discusses some of the\ndigital-library activities being undertaken by\ninternational organizations such as the EU,\nRLG, OCLC and the Consortium of European\nResearch Libraries. In concluding this chapter\n(and Part 3), the author states (p. 183): \"The\nspecifics \" of international digital libraries\ndevelopment reveal needs . . . that will not be\nmet satisfactorily by the private enterprise model\nthat is currently driving development in the\nUnited States.'\nThe last three chapters (20 to 22) that make up\nthe final section of the book are devoted to\nvarious 'generalities'. The thrust here is a\ndiscussion of three general problems that con-\nfront international digital-library efforts. The\nfirst (Chapter 20) concerns 'mythologies of\nobjectivity' and value-free media with respect to\ndigital science; the question posed is: 'Is the pipe\nneutral?' The second problem (Chapter 21)\nconcerns 'antiquated paradigms for information\nservices provision' and the identity crisis of\nlibraries themselves. The third difficulty\n(Chapter 22) relates to human users: their dislike\nof and lack of interest in technology, and the\n'wicked problem' they present for developers of\ninternational digital libraries.\nThe four appendices provide extensive addi-\ntional information. Appendix A gives details of\nFrench libraries online (Minitel Kiosk libraries,\nMinitel V23 direct-dial, and Telnet). Appendix B\npresents information on various electronic\nconferences, an upcoming feature of digital\nlibraries. Appendices C and D provide, respect-\nively, details of some useful sources of statistical\ninformation relating to the Internet, and an\nanalysis of the meaning of the term 'digital\nlibrary'. .\nThe book is written in a clear, easy-to-read style.\nIt contains numerous good-quality screen dumps\nof Netscape Web pages that have been taken\nfrom the many different digital libraries\ndescribed in the book. Of course, as one might\nexpect in a treatise of this sort, there are lots of\nURLs that can be used to follow up the material\ndescribed.\nUndoubtedly, then, this monograph makes an\nextremely useful contribution to its field. In my\nview, for anyone who is interested in digital\nlibraries and\/or their use as an educational\nresource, it will be essential reading.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\n62\n"}
