We review the results and propose a structural model that is consistent with\nall the observations. The upper crust is typically 7 \u00b1 1 km thick, heterogeneous and has high\nvelocity gradients. The lower crust is typically 15\u201330 \u00b1 5 km thick and begins where the\nvelocity gradient decreases radically. This generally occurs at the V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121 level. A\nlow-velocity zone \u223c10 000 km2 in area and up to \u223c15 km thick occupies the lower crust beneath\ncentral Iceland, and may represent a submerged, trapped oceanic microplate. The crust\u2013mantle\nboundary is a transition zone \u223c5 \u00b1 3 km thick throughout which V p increases progressively\nfrom \u223c7.2 to \u223c8.0 km s\u22121. It may be gradational or a zone of alternating high- and low-velocity\nlayers. There is no seismic evidence for melt or exceptionally high temperatures in or near this\nzone. Isostasy indicates that the density contrast between the lower crust and the mantle is only\n\u223c90 kg m\u22123 compared with \u223c300 kg m\u22123 for normal oceanic crust, indicating compositional\nanomalies that are as yet not understood. The seismological crust is \u223c30 km thick beneath the\nGreenland\u2013Iceland and Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridges, and eastern Iceland, \u223c20 km beneath western\nIceland, and \u223c40 km thick beneath central Iceland. This pattern is not what is predicted for an\neastward-migrating plume. Low attenuation and normal V p\/V s ratios in the lower crust beneath\ncentral and southwestern Iceland, and normal uppermost mantle velocities in general, suggest\nthat the crust and uppermost mantle are subsolidus and cooler than at equivalent depths beneath\nthe East Pacific Rise. Seismic data from Iceland have historically been interpreted both in terms\nof thin\u2013hot and thick\u2013cold crust models, both of which have been cited as supporting the plume\nhypothesis. This suggests that the plume model for Iceland is an a priori assumption rather\nthan a hypothesis subject to testing. The long-extinct Ontong\u2013Java Plateau, northwest India and\nParana\u00b4, Brazil large igneous provinces, beneath which mantle plumes are not expected, are all\nunderlain by mantle low-velocity bodies similar to that beneath Iceland. A plume interpretation\nfor the mantle anomaly beneath Iceland is thus not required.\nKey words: crust, Iceland, mantle, plume, receiver functions, seismology.\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe term \u2018Icelandic-type crust\u2019 was first proposed by Bott (1974)\nwho noted that the crust beneath the Iceland transverse ridge differs\nfundamentally from both oceanic and continental crust. He pointed\nout that individual layers are generally equivalent to those of nor-\nmal oceanic crust, but are much thicker and more variable. This\nwas founded on seismic work performed both in Iceland and on\nthe Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge, commencing with the pioneering work\nof Ba\u02dath (1960), who measured long explosion seismic profiles in\nwestern Iceland.\nA great deal of work has been done subsequently to map the\nstructure and thickness of Icelandic-type crust. The data quality and\nprocessing techniques have progressively improved. In the case of\nearly explosion profiles, data processing used traditional methods\nbased on first-arrival times only, and models comprised stacks of\nhomogeneous layers. Such models provide only a first-order de-\nscription of structure. As is the case for oceanic crust in general,\nlayers that are clearly and unambiguously laterally extensive must\nbe defined in terms of velocity gradient.\nIcelandic-type crust is laterally inhomogeneous, as has been\nshown by modern experiments involving dense arrays of three-\ncomponent seismic stations and waveform modelling, tomographic\nand receiver-function processing techniques (e.g. Bjarnason et al.\n1993; Miller et al. 1998b; Du & Foulger 1999). Horizontal ve-\nlocity gradients commonly exceed vertical gradients, velocities\ncharacteristic of the lower crust may become shallower by >10 km\nover short distances, and even approach the surface. Low-velocity\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS 567\n568 G. R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R. Julian\nzones (LVZs) are common and structural variations occur on all\nspatial scales. It is questionable whether the term \u2018Mohorovicic dis-\ncontinuity\u2019 (Moho) is appropriate for the crust\u2013mantle boundary\nbeneath much of Iceland, which comprises a transition zone sev-\neral kilometres thick throughout which seismic velocities are grada-\ntional. Such structure is predicted by petrogenesis models. Laterally\ncontinuous intervals of constant seismic velocity, and the seismo-\nlogical base of the crust, are probably variable petrologically, and\nthis must be considered if seismic results are to contribute to under-\nstanding the geology of Icelandic-type crust and the processes that\ncreate it.\nThe assumption that Iceland is underlain by a mantle plume\nhas constrained interpretations of crustal studies for the last three\ndecades, despite the fact that extremely different crustal models have\nbeen proposed. In the 1980s Icelandic-type crust was considered to\nbe as thin as \u223c10\u201315 km and to be underlain by partially molten up-\nper mantle at temperatures of \u223c1100 \u25e6C (the \u2018thin\u2013hot\u2019 crust model).\nWith the acquisition of better data, this was superseded in the 1990s\nby a model involving a crust \u223c20\u201340 km thick with anomalously\nlow temperatures in the lower crust (the \u2018thick\u2013cold\u2019 crust model).\nBoth of these models have been interpreted as supporting the plume\nhypothesis.\nIn this paper we review the structure of Icelandic-type crust as\nrevealed by a suite of seismological methods, and propose a seismic\nand petrological model that is consistent with all the observations.\nWe compare this model to both normal-thickness oceanic crust and\noceanic large igneous provinces (LIPs) and critically evaluate the\nresults within the framework of the plume hypothesis.\nT H E I C E L A N D I C T R A N S V E R S E R I D G E\nSubsequent to the opening of the North Atlantic \u223c54 Ma, the\n\u223c1200 km long Icelandic transverse ridge formed as a result of\nlocally enhanced magmatic activity beneath a section of the mid-\nAtlantic ridge (MAR) several hundred kilometres in north\u2013south\nextent (Fig. 1). The ridge formed in the neighbourhood of a major,\neast\u2013west-trending structure that separates regions with contrasting\ntectonic histories to its north and south. This structure comprises a\ncomplex of fracture zones that have been active at different times\n(Bott 1985). Those parts of the transverse ridge that are currently\nsubmarine formed subaerially and subsequently cooled and subsided\nbelow sea level (e.g. Bott 1974; Nilsen 1978). Only Iceland is now\nabove sea level. The transverse ridge is asymmetric about Iceland.\nThe Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge is longer than, and differently orientated\nfrom, the Greenland\u2013Iceland ridge as a result of westward migration\nof the MAR and a change in spreading direction \u223c44 Ma (Bott &\nGunnarsson 1980).\nBecause it is subaerial, more is known concerning the geology\nand tectonics of Iceland than other parts of the MAR. Some 30\nspreading segments are exposed, and two fracture zones that offset\nto the east that part of the spreading plate boundary between the\nReykjanes ridge to the south and the Kolbeinsey ridge to the north.\nIn south Iceland the active spreading zone comprises the Western\nand Eastern Volcanic Zones (WVZ, EVZ), between which lies an\neast\u2013west-orientated shear zone, the South Iceland Seismic Zone\n(SISZ). In the north, spreading occurs along the single Northern\nVolcanic Zone (NVZ). In central Iceland the WVZ, EVZ and NVZ\nare connected by the Middle Volcanic Zone (MVZ).\nThe geological and tectonic structure of Iceland is complicated\nbecause spreading has occurred about a parallel pair of ridges since\n\u223c26 Ma (Bott 1985), and ridge migrations both to the east and\nwest have occurred (e.g. Saemundsson 1979; Foulger 2002). Ex-\ntinct spreading zones lie along the northwestern edge of the West-\nern Fjords (WF; Fig. 1), and along the Skagi peninsula. The Ter-\ntiary area between the NVZ and the extinct Skagi zone is called the\nTrollaskagi block and the area between the WVZ and the EVZ is\ncalled the Hreppar block. The current NVZ is a reactivation at \u223c7\nMa of an older spreading zone in a similar location (Saemundsson\net al. 1980; Hardarson & Fitton 1993), and the EVZ started to form\nat \u223c2 Ma. The distance between the 13 Ma isochrones in the ex-\ntreme east and west of Iceland is much greater than corresponds to\nthe full spreading rate of 1.8 cm yr\u22121, and indicates that \u223c40 per\ncent of the width of the crust in Iceland must comprise rocks older\nthan 13 Ma, buried beneath younger volcanics (Foulger 2002). Vol-\ncanically active zones within which crustal extension is insignificant\nare classified as flank zones (Saemundsson 1979) and include the\nSnaefellsnes peninsula and the southern part of the EVZ. Outside the\nactive volcanic zones, Tertiary areas contain extinct dyke and fault\nswarms, central volcanoes and calderas, suggesting that a complex\npattern of crustal accretion has always been the norm (Jo\u00b4hannesson\n& Saemundsson 1998).\nO C E A N I C C RU S T\nSeismological models\nOceanic crust is typically \u223c7 km thick but may be up to \u223c35 km\nthick beneath oceanic LIPs. Models comprising a few homogenous\nlayers are inadequate to explain seismic observations other than sim-\nple first-arrival times. Velocity gradients are required by amplitude\nobservations (e.g. Helmberger & Morris 1970; Spudich & Orcutt\n1980). Beneath unconsolidated surface layers, oceanic layer 2 is\nusually \u223c3 km thick, characterized by steep velocity gradients of\nup to 2 s\u22121 and variable laterally. The transition to oceanic layer 3\nis typically marked by a reduction in velocity gradient by an order\nof magnitude. Layer 3 may contain substantial LVZs.\nA two-gradient velocity structure characterizes oceanic crust of\nall thicknesses (Mutter & Mutter 1993). The change in velocity gra-\ndient between oceanic layers 2 and 3 typically occurs at a velocity\nof V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121, and layer 3 velocities generally range up to\nV p \u223c 7.3 km s\u22121. Velocities in the range V p = 7.3\u20137.8 km s\u22121\nare considered to comprise a \u2018crust\u2013mantle transition layer\u2019, and\nvelocities of V p > 7.8 km s\u22121 are characteristic of mantle rocks.\nVariations in crustal thickness correlate with variations in the thick-\nness of layer 3. The nature of the crust\u2013mantle transition is variable.\nIt may comprise a sharp discontinuity in V p of \u223c1 km s\u22121, a LVZ\nin the lower part of layer 3, a high-velocity crustal basal layer, or\na gradational transition zone with increased velocity gradient and\nV p = 7.2\u20137.8 km s\u22121. It may have a laminated internal structure.\nThe level of structural detail resolvable is limited by the seismic\nwavelengths used, and early models were probably oversimplified.\nSeismic velocities in oceanic crust increase with age, especially in\nthe upper part of layer 2, because of compaction and infilling of\npores with minerals.\nOphiolites\nThe correspondence of seismic velocity and petrology has been stud-\nied in ophiolites (Fig. 2). Seismic velocities are dependent on pres-\nsure, pore-fluid pressure, porosity, the presence of voids, the void\naspect ratio, petrology and metamorphic facies, and thus seismic\nboundaries do not necessarily coincide with petrological boundaries\n(e.g. Salisbury & Christensen 1978). In general, however, laboratory\nmeasurements of ophiolitic rocks suggest that layer 2 corresponds\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 569\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1.\nM\nap\nof\nth\ne\nIc\nel\nan\ndi\nc\ntr\nan\nsv\ner\nse\nri\ndg\ne\nsh\now\nin\ng\nba\nth\nym\net\nri\nc\nco\nnt\nou\nrs\nan\nd\nte\nct\non\nic\nfe\nat\nur\nes\nin\nIc\nel\nan\nd.\nT\nhe\nne\nov\nol\nca\nni\nc\nzo\nne\ns\nar\ne\nou\ntl\nin\ned\n.S\npr\nea\ndi\nng\nse\ngm\nen\nts\n(v\nol\nca\nni\nc\nsy\nst\nem\ns)\nar\ne\nsh\now\nn\nin\ngr\ney\nan\nd\ngl\nac\nie\nrs\nin\nw\nhi\nte\n.\nR\nR\n,\nR\ney\nkj\nan\nes\nri\ndg\ne;\nK\nR\n,\nK\nol\nbe\nin\nse\ny\nri\ndg\ne;\nW\nV\nZ\n,\nW\nes\nte\nrn\nV\nol\nca\nni\nc\nZ\non\ne;\nE\nV\nZ\n,\nE\nas\nte\nrn\nV\nol\nca\nni\nc\nZ\non\ne;\nN\nV\nZ\n,\nN\nor\nth\ner\nn\nV\nol\nca\nni\nc\nZ\non\ne;\nM\nV\nZ\n,\nM\nid\ndl\ne\nV\nol\nca\nni\nc\nZ\non\ne;\nS\nIS\nZ\n,\nS\nou\nth\nIc\nel\nan\nd\nS\nei\nsm\nic\nZ\non\ne;\nW\nF,\nW\nes\nte\nrn\nF\njo\nrd\ns;\nS\nP,\nS\nna\nef\nel\nls\nne\ns\nPe\nni\nns\nul\na.\nT\nhe\nN\nA\nS\nP,\nF\nIR\nE\n,I\nC\nE\nM\nE\nLT\n,B\n96\n,R\nR\nIS\nP,\nS\nIS\nT,\nR\nIS\nE\nan\nd\nS\nIG\nM\nA\n1\nex\npl\nos\nio\nn\nse\nis\nm\nol\nog\ny\npr\nofi\nle\ns\nar\ne\nla\nbe\nll\ned\n.T\nhe\nst\nar\nin\ndi\nca\nte\ns\nth\ne\nlo\nca\nti\non\nof\nth\ne\nR\ney\nda\nrf\njo\nrd\nur\nsh\not\ndi\nsc\nus\nse\nd\nin\nth\ne\nte\nxt\n.T\nhi\nn\nli\nne\ns\nin\ndi\nca\nte\nth\ne\npr\nofi\nle\ns\nof\nB\na\u02dat\nh\n(1\n96\n0)\nan\nd\nda\nsh\ned\nli\nne\ns\nin\ndi\nca\nte\nth\ne\npr\nofi\nle\ns\nof\nPa\nlm\nas\non\n(1\n97\n1)\nth\nat\nw\ner\ne\nlo\nng\ner\nth\nan\n10\n0\nkm\n.C\nir\ncl\nes\nco\nnt\nai\nni\nng\nnu\nm\nbe\nrs\nin\ndi\nca\nte\nse\nis\nm\nic\nst\nat\nio\nns\nof\nth\ne\nIc\nel\nan\nd\nH\not\nsp\not\nP\nro\nje\nct\n.C\nir\ncl\nes\nw\nit\nh\nth\nre\ne-\nle\ntt\ner\nla\nbe\nls\nin\ndi\nca\nte\not\nhe\nr\nbr\noa\nd-\nba\nnd\nse\nis\nm\nic\nst\nat\nio\nns\nin\nIc\nel\nan\nd.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n570 G.

The upper part of this sequence corresponds to amphi-\nbolite metamorphic facies and the lower part to granulite facies.\nThe seismic Moho is thought to correspond to the boundary be-\ntween overlying troctolite and underlying dunite (e.g. Salisbury &\nChristensen 1978; Christensen & Smewing 1981; Dilek et al. 1998).\nThe \u2018petrological Moho\u2019 recognized in ophiolites is the transition\nfrom dunite to underlying tectonized harzburgites. The separation of\nthe seismological and petrological Mohos may be 0\u20131.5 km, and thus\nthe dunite layer may be up to 20 per cent of the total crustal thick-\nness. Anisotropy in V p may be as large as \u223c8 per cent in ophiolitic\nharzburgites as a result of preferential olivine crystal orientation,\nwith velocities varying from approximately 7.8 to 8.5 km s\u22121 with\npropagation direction.\nOceanic crust beneath the mid-Atlantic\nridge and the North Atlantic\nThe structure of the oceanic crust beneath the North Atlantic, and\nparticularly the crest and flanks of the MAR and the transition\nto Icelandic-type crust, has been the subject of numerous explo-\nsion seismic-refraction and some surface wave studies (e.g. Talwani\net al. 1971; Fowler 1976, 1978; Bunch 1980; Bunch & Kennett\n1980; Goldflam et al. 1980; Jacoby & Girardin 1980; Keen et al.\n1980; White 1984; Ritzert & Jacoby 1985; Smallwood et al. 1995;\nRichardson et al. 1998; Smallwood & White 1998; Weir et al. 2001).\nThe crust beneath the North Atlantic is best modelled as an upper\ncrust with high velocity gradients of 1\u20132 s\u22121, and a lower crust with\nlow gradients of \u223c0.1 s\u22121. Reports of the nature of the crust\u2013mantle\ntransition are variable. Some studies report a sharp Moho with a\nvelocity discontinuity as large as V p = 0.8 km s\u22121, with V p increas-\ning from \u223c7.2 to 7.8 km s\u22121 (Table 1). Others report a gradational\ncrust\u2013mantle transition zone with a thickness of up to 15 per cent of\nthe total crustal thickness. It is not clear to what extent the variability\nin these reports results from different experimental conditions, and\nwhether the crust\u2013mantle transition may be gradational everywhere.\nThe picture is complicated further by the use of widely differing def-\ninitions of \u2018upper-mantle\u2019 velocities, from V p = 7.2 km s\u22121 at the\nridge crest (e.g. Fowler 1976) to V p = 8.2 km s\u22121 beneath the ridge\nflank (e.g. Bunch 1980).\nStructure beneath the MAR crest contrasts with that beneath the\nflanks.

R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R. Julian\n(e.g. Fowler 1976, 1978; Bunch & Kennett 1980). Dispersion of\nsurface waves at periods of 6\u201340 s suggests velocity reversals in the\nmantle at depths of >20 km (Jacoby & Girardin 1980; Keen et al.\n1980). Away from the ridge crest, velocities increase, probably due\nto compaction, cooling and deposition of minerals in voids in the\nshallowest layers. Layer 3 thickens, and \u2018normal\u2019 uppermost mantle\nvelocities of V p > 8.0 km s\u22121 are encountered beneath crust that is\na few Myr old.\nAlong much of the ridge between the Bight fracture zone at\n\u223c56\u25e630\u2032N and Iceland, the crust is 8\u201311 km thick (see the refer-\nences cited above). This increases relatively abruptly to \u223c15 km\nimmediately offshore of the Reykjanes peninsula in SW Iceland\n(Weir et al. 2001). Along the Reykjanes ridge, within \u223c250 km of\nIceland, the crust appears to thin laterally away from the ridge crest,\nwhereas at greater distances from Iceland the crust thickens away\nfrom the ridge. Off-ridge uppermost mantle velocities are also re-\nported to decrease on approaching Iceland, and are as low as V p =\n7.7\u20137.9 km s\u22121 within 100 km of Iceland (e.g. Gebrande et al. 1980).\nMantle velocities of V p \u223c 8.2 km s\u22121, such as are observed at \u223c7 km\ndepth at large distances from Iceland, are not encountered shallower\nthan 16\u201318 km within 100 km of Iceland.\nE A R LY S E I S M I C S T U D I E S O F\nI C E L A N D I C - T Y P E C RU S T\nEarly explosion seismology studies of the crust beneath the\nIceland transverse ridge used P-phase arrival times. These, along\nwith an early surface wave study, were interpreted in terms of simple\nlayered models (Fig. 3a) (Ba\u02dath 1960; Tryggvason 1962; Palmason\n1971; Zverev et al. 1976; Bott & Gunnarsson 1980). In a pioneering\nexperiment in 1959, Ba\u02dath (1960) recorded data on two unreversed\nexplosion profiles \u223c150 and \u223c250 km long in western and central\nIceland (Fig. 1). He interpreted the times of first arrivals in terms\nof a three-layered model and observed reflections he concluded to\ncome from the Moho at a depth of \u223c28 km. Tryggvason (1962)\nconstructed standard surface wave group-velocity dispersion curves\nfor Love and Rayleigh waves from 20 earthquakes along the mid-\nAtlantic ridge up to \u223c1000 km from Iceland, and also interpreted\nthe results in terms of a three-layered structure. Palmason (1971)\ngathered data on \u223c40 profiles up to \u223c150 km long covering most of\nIceland (Fig. 1), and processed the data using conventional seismic\nrefraction theory. He emphasized the lateral heterogeneity of the\nIcelandic crust, and developed layered models involving average\nvelocities and interface depth ranges. In 1972 Zverev et al. (1976)\nand Bott & Gunnarsson (1980) shot the \u223c450 km long NASP pro-\nfile, which extended almost the entire length of the Iceland\u2013Faeroe\nridge and was recorded at stations on the Faeroe Islands, Iceland,\nand the ridge itself (Fig. 1). They studied variations in the depth to\nthe mantle beneath the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge using the \u03c4\u2013p method\nand modified time-term analysis.\nThere is little resemblance between the models proposed (Fig. 3a).\nFor the shallow crust, where velocities are less than \u223c6.0 km s\u22121, a\ngreat variety of characteristic layer velocities have been proposed.\nIn addition, two fundamentally different interpretations were pro-\nposed for the deepest, highest-velocity material sampled, with ma-\nterial with V p = 7.2\u20137.4 km s\u22121 being variously attributed to the\nlower crust (Ba\u02dath 1960) or the upper mantle (Tryggvason 1962;\nPalmason 1971). Ba\u02dath (1960) assigned this material to the lower\ncrust because reflections were observed from a deeper interface,\nwhich provided a candidate for the Moho. In contrast, Tryggvason\n(1962) and Palmason (1971) did not observe deeper layers or in-\nFigure 3.

The Iceland\u2013Faeroe\nridge lacked the ambiguous V p = 7.2\u20137.4 km s\u22121 layer, but fea-\ntured a V p = 6.8 km s\u22121 layer directly overlying material with V p =\n7.8 km s\u22121 at depths of 27\u201342 km (Zverev et al. 1976; Bott &\nGunnarsson 1980) (Fig. 3a). This structure naturally invited place-\nment of the crust\u2013mantle boundary between these two layers.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 573\nApart from the observation of velocities in the range V p = 7.2\u2013\n7.4 km s\u22121 beneath Iceland, only two other ubiquitous features were\nreported. These are the extreme variation in velocity, both vertically\nand horizontally, in the upper crust (where V p is typically observed to\nbe <\u223c6.5 km s\u22121), and the contrasting homogeneity of the underlying\nlower crust.\nR E C E N T S E I S M I C S T U D I E S\nO F I C E L A N D I C - T Y P E C RU S T\nSince 1977, numerous long explosion-seismology profiles have been\nmeasured using densely distributed, three-component seismic sta-\ntions and, latterly, GPS timing. Digital recording has aided phase\nrecognition by enabling easy filtering of the noisy data typically\ncollected in the North Atlantic, and facilitated the application of\nmodern data analysis techniques such as waveform modelling. Ex-\nperiments have spanned contrasting tectonic regions and focused on\ndetermining lateral variations in structure (Figs 1 and 3b).\nAs soon as waveform modelling was applied to explosion seis-\nmology data from Iceland it became clear that Icelandic-type crust is\nmost naturally subdivided on the basis of velocity gradient. Flovenz\n(1980) reinterpreted explosion seismograms gathered by Palmason\n(1971) using synthetic seismograms, and was the first to emphasize\nthat a simple layered model is inconsistent with observed ampli-\ntudes. He divided the crust into two layers on the basis of velocity\ngradient (Fig. 3b, Table 1). The upper crust exhibits high velocity\ngradients of \u223c0.57 s\u22121 beneath the V p \u223c 3.5 km s\u22121 horizon. The\nlower crust beneath the V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121 velocity horizon, typically\nat 5\u20136 km depth, has a much smaller velocity gradient.\nLateral heterogeneity in the upper crust is extreme. Velocities\nof V p = 6.5 km s\u22121 may occur close to the surface beneath vol-\ncanoes (e.g. Einarsson 1978; Foulger & Toomey 1989; Toomey &\nFoulger 1989; Arnott & Foulger 1994; Gudmundsson et al. 1994;\nFoulger et al. 1995; Miller 1996), and ground deformation indicates\nthe presence of shallow magma chambers (e.g. Bjo\u00a8rnsson 1985;\nSigmundsson et al. 1992). Velocities of V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121, proba-\nbly associated with gabbroic intrusions, occur within \u223c2 km of the\nsurface, and low-velocity magma accumulations exist locally in the\nupper crust. Horizontal velocity gradients may exceed vertical gra-\ndients, and so schemes that use absolute velocities to define laterally\nextensive layers are unsuitable for Icelandic-type crust.\nConsiderable debate has revolved around whether the V p = 7.2\u2013\n7.4 km s\u22121 material should be attributed to the lower crust, as orig-\ninally proposed by Ba\u02dath (1960) (the thick\u2013cold crust model), or to\nthe upper mantle, as suggested by later workers (the thin\u2013hot crust\nmodel). The 1977 800 km long RRISP land\u2013sea explosion profile\nextended along magnetic anomaly 5 (\u223c10 Ma) on the southeastern\nflank of the Reykjanes ridge and crossed Iceland along the EVZ and\nthe NVZ (Angenheister et al. 1980; Gebrande et al. 1980) (Fig. 1).\nThe first-arrival times were forward modelled by ray tracing through\na structure divided into three layers, each with a characteristic ve-\nlocity gradient (Fig. 3b, Table 1). Both offshore and beneath Iceland,\nthe shallowest levels exhibit high velocity gradients, and deeper lev-\nels, where velocities exceeded V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121, have much lower\ngradients. Offshore the crust was found to be \u223c10 km thick, beneath\nwhich V p rises steeply to 7.8 km s\u22121, a velocity that was attributed\nto the mantle. No such discontinuity or high velocities were found\nbeneath Iceland, however. Instead, the data were interpreted as indi-\ncating that velocities did not exceed V p = 7.6 km s\u22121 in the upper\n50 km.\nLike Palmason (1971), Gebrande et al. (1980) attributed material\nwith V p = 7.0\u20137.6 km s\u22121 beneath Iceland to anomalously hot up-\nper mantle. Both Palmason (1971) and Gebrande et al. (1980) were\naware of the extensive debate regarding the assignation of this ma-\nterial, and that it had been attributed variously to crustal layer 3B or\nupper mantle. Gebrande et al. (1980) remark that it is \u2018more or less\na question of definition\u2019 whether it is attributed to the lower crust or\nthe upper mantle. They favoured an anomalous upper-mantle inter-\npretation because:\n(1) they did not observe any widespread deeper discontinuity,\nreflector or feature that was a candidate for the Moho or the crust\u2013\nmantle boundary;\n(2) teleseismic P-wave delays in Iceland had been shown to be\ncompatible with low upper-mantle velocities extending from the\nsurface down to over 200 km, and with the observed Bouguer gravity\nlow over Iceland (Tryggvason 1964; Bott 1965; Long & Mitchell\n1970);\n(3) velocities in the range V p = 7.2\u20137.6 km s\u22121 had been reported\nfor MOR axial zones, and attributed to crust\u2013mantle mixing or to\npartial fusion in the upper mantle (e.g. Ewing & Ewing 1959; Bott\n1965; Oxburgh & Turcotte 1968; Vogt et al. 1969; Fowler 1976);\n(4) temperatures of 1000\u20131100 \u25e6C, and thus partial melt, were\npredicted at depths of 10\u201320 km, where velocities of V p = 7.0\u2013\n7.4 km s\u22121 were encountered. At such temperatures, the seismic\nvelocity in gabbros and metagabbros is much less than V p = 7.0\u2013\n7.4 km s\u22121, whereas these velocities agree well with partially molten\nmantle peridotite. Four types of observation had been interpreted as\nindicating high temperatures and partial melt, which were expected\nbeneath a hotspot and within a mantle plume such as was assumed\nto underlie Iceland.\n(a) High surface temperature gradients in Iceland of \u223c50\u2013100\n\u25e6C km\u22121 away from geothermal areas, which predict supra-solidus\ntemperatures at 10\u201320 km depth if extrapolated linearly downward\n(Palmason 1974; Flovenz & Saemundsson 1993).\n(b) Shear waves from RRISP explosions that penetrated the V p >\n7.0 km s\u22121 material were attenuated, suggesting partial melt\n(Gebrande et al. 1980).\n(c) A high average V p\/V s of 1.96, consistent with partial melt,\nwas deduced from RRISP data for rays that travelled in the V p >\n7.0 km s\u22121 material beneath Iceland (Gebrande et al. 1980).\n(d) Magnetotelluric measurements over much of Iceland de-\ntect a widespread, high-conductivity layer, interpreted as a \u223c5 km\nthick interval of high-degree (\u223c10\u201320 per cent) partial melt\nat 10\u201320 km depths (e.g. Hermance & Grillot 1974; Beblo\n& Bjornsson 1978; 1980; Beblo et al. 1983; Eysteinsson &\nHermance 1985).\nThe thin\u2013hot crust model was challenged by Bjarnason et al.\n(1993), who shot the 170 km long South Iceland Seismic Transect\n(SIST) from the west coast of Iceland across the WVZ, the SISZ and\nthe EVZ (Fig. 1). The seismic stations were sufficiently dense for\nhigh-resolution tomography of the upper crust and lower-resolution\nsampling to \u223c25 km depth, where structure was modelled using\nforward ray tracing. This study confirmed the lateral inhomogene-\nity of the upper crust and the gradational velocity structure of the\nentire crust (Fig. 3b, Table 1). It also detected an apparent veloc-\nity of V p = 7.7 km s\u22121 for a reflecting horizon at a depth of 20\u2013\n24 km, thereby becoming the first study to repeat the observation of\nBa\u02dath (1960). This part of the profile was unreversed (i.e. an explo-\nsion at only one end of the profile sampled the volume of interest),\nand thus this velocity is only the correct mantle velocity if there\nis no dip on the refracting horizon. The horizon was interpreted as\na sharp Moho across which the velocity jumps from V p = 7.25 to\n7.5 km s\u22121, rapidly rising to 7.7 km s\u22121 below the reflector. The\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n574 G. R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R. Julian\nagreement with the result of Ba\u02dath (1960), who obtained a depth of\n28 km for his reflective horizon, is impressive considering the early\ndate of that experiment. Bjarnason et al. (1993) point out that similar\nreflections observed in the RRISP data beneath the NVZ and east-\nern Iceland, and attributed by Gebrande et al. (1980) to thin, high-\nvelocity lenses, could also be reflections from a horizon \u223c30 km\ndeep.\nThe interpretation of Bjarnason et al. (1993) implied that ma-\nterial with velocity up to V p = 7.5 km s\u22121 is gabbroic and not\nmantle peridotite. On the basis of seismic velocity they estimated\nthe temperature at the reflector to be 600\u2013900 \u25e6C, which is be-\nlow the solidus for gabbro. This implies that it does not con-\ntain pervasive melt as predicted by the thin\u2013hot crust model, al-\nthough Gudmundsson (1994) pointed out that this interpretation\nwas not safe on the basis of seismic velocities alone, given the\nuncertainties.\nSubsequent reappraisal of the non-seismic evidence for supra-\nsolidus temperatures in the V p = 7.0\u20137.5 km s\u22121 material suggested\nthat those data may be compatible with subsolidus temperatures\n(Menke & Levin 1994; Menke & Sparks 1995; Menke et al. 1995,\n1996). Linear downward extrapolation of surface geothermal gradi-\nents predicts temperatures corresponding to the brittle\u2013plastic tran-\nsition (\u223c400\u2013650\u25e6C for the lithology and strain rates expected under\nIceland) at the seismogenic base, which varies in the range \u223c6\u2013\n14 km (e.g. Stefa\u00b4nsson et al. 1993; Foulger 1995). However, linear\nextrapolation is only valid in the steady-state conductive regime in\nthe absence of heat sources. The thermal state of the shallow upper\ncrust is influenced by hydrothermal circulation, and the geothermal\ngradient may be smaller in the lower crust (Menke & Sparks 1995).\nShear waves from earthquakes at ranges of up to \u223c350 km exhibit\nlittle attenuation on passage beneath Iceland at 10\u201320 km depth\nand minimum values of Qp \u2265 100 and Qs \u2265 250 are inferred for\nthe lower crust beneath central and southwest Iceland (Menke &\nLevin 1994; Menke et al. 1995). Values of Qs \u223c 20 are expected\nfor near-solidus gabbro and Qp \u223c 40 for peridotite at 950 \u25e6C. The\nobservations suggest maximum temperatures for the lower crust\nin general of 700\u2013950 \u25e6C, substantially below the solidus of both\ngabbro and peridotite at \u223c20 km depth. Menke et al. (1996) suggest\nthat the low values of V s and V p\/V s ratios of 1.96 deduced from\nthe RRISP data (Gebrande et al. 1980) were erroneous and result\nfrom uncorrected source static anomalies and misidentification of\nSmS as S. Reappraisal of those data suggests more normal values\nof 1.76 for V p\/V s in the lower crust, consistent with subsolidus\ntemperatures and the results of later explosion profiles (e.g. Staples\net al. 1997; Darbyshire et al. 1998). Interpretation of magnetotelluric\ndata suffers from poor resolution and the ratio of depth: thickness of\nlow-resistivity layers is ambiguous. The magnetotelluric data from\nIceland could be fit by a thin, low-resistivity layer or a thick higher-\nresistivity layer, and do not strongly constrain structure at depth\nbeneath Iceland.\nSubsequent to this revision in thinking, several additional long,\nhigh-quality explosion profiles were measured in Iceland (Fig. 1).\nThe 1994 Faeroe\u2013Iceland Ridge Experiment (FIRE) profile com-\nprised over 60 large explosions, with 100 three-component recorders\narrayed along the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge and crossing eastern Iceland\nand the NVZ (Staples et al. 1997). The 310 km long 1995 ICEMELT\nprofile extended from Skagi and traversed central Iceland to the\nsoutheast coast (Darbyshire et al. 1998) (Fig. 4). This profile in-\ncluded \u223c60 three-component stations and six large explosions. In\n1996 the \u223c75 km long, B96 profile probed the western flank of the\nNVZ (Menke et al. 1998). The Reykjanes peninsula and Reykjanes\nridge immediately offshore were investigated by the \u223c220 km long\nRISE profile, which involved \u223c40 stations on land and 27 ocean-\nbottom seismometers (Weir et al. 2001). The data from all of these\nprofiles were modelled using forward ray tracing.\nAll modern explosion seismology studies confirm the structure\nproposed by Flovenz (1980), with shallow, V p <\u223c 6.5 km s\u22121 ma-\nterial having large vertical velocity gradients (typically \u223c0.25 s\u22121)\nand great lateral heterogeneity, and deeper material having velocity\ngradients an order of magnitude lower (typically \u223c0.024 s\u22121) (e.g.\nFig. 4). Despite such observations, schemes for subdivision on the\nbasis of absolute velocity are nevertheless often presented (Table 1).\nThese schemes vary between studies, may require modification even\nalong a single profile and are thus of limited use. Deep, post-critical\nreflections of variable clarity are reported from all the profiles and\nare generally attributed to a sharp Moho, although Staples (1997)\nsuggested on the basis of reflectivity modelling that the FIRE data\nmay be satisfied by a transition zone up to 2 km thick. Only on\ntwo unreversed profiles have mantle-diving rays been detected, both\nwithin or close to Tertiary blocks (Bjarnason et al. 1993; Menke\net al. 1998), and so clear, unambiguous measurement of mantle ve-\nlocity using explosion seismology has not been achieved. Synthetic\nseismograms calculated by the reflectivity method were used to es-\ntimate the amplitude of the velocity discontinuity in a number of\ncases. Although the mantle is expected to exhibit up to 0.7 km s\u22121\nanisotropy in V p (e.g. Salisbury & Christensen 1978; Christensen\n& Smewing 1981), no systematic mantle velocity variation with az-\nimuth is discernible. The main conclusions from these profiles are\nsummarized in Table 1.\nA recent surface wave study investigated the structure of the crust\nbeneath Iceland using partitioned waveform inversion (Allen et al.\n2002). The frequency window used was 0.03\u20130.1 Hz, corresponding\nto wavelengths of \u223c40\u2013120 km and the inversion was constrained by\nthe estimates of crustal thickness from explosion seismology. The\nlarge velocity gradients in the upper few kilometres and lower gra-\ndients beneath were confirmed. The agreement with mantle veloc-\nities determined by explosion seismology (and receiver functions,\nsee below) is much poorer. For the mantle, V s \u223c 3.7\u20134.0 km s\u22121\n(corresponding to V p = 6.5\u20137.05, assuming V p\/V s = 1.76) was de-\ntermined, along with V p\/V s \u223c 1.92 at 35 km depth. This is close to\nthe value of 1.96 determined by Gebrande et al. (1980) from RRISP\ndata and shown to be erroneous by Menke et al. (1996) using the\nsame data, which brings into question the validity of the surface\nwave results.\nSeismic and gravity data have been jointly modelled both to test\nthe seismic results (Staples et al. 1997; Weir et al. 2001) and to\nproduce pan-Iceland crustal models (e.g. Darbyshire et al. 2000b).\nThe models developed place density anomalies in the upper man-\ntle, which, if interpreted as variations in temperature, require large\nanomalies of 400 \u25e6C beneath the Reykjanes ridge (Weir et al. 2001)\nand 700 \u25e6C beneath the NVZ (Staples et al. 1997). Darbyshire et al.\n(2000b) assembled all explosion seismology and receiver function\nresults then available and used the gravity field to estimate the\ncrustal thickness beneath regions unsampled seismically (Fig. 5).\nThey concluded that the crustal thickness varies from \u223c40 km be-\nneath northwest Vatnajokull to \u223c15 km in the southwest. They fur-\nther concluded that the gravity data require density anomalies in the\nmantle of up to 110 kg m\u22123 a few tens of kilometres wide beneath\nthe rift zones and northwest Vatnajokull, corresponding to lateral\ndensity anomalies of \u223c3 per cent and temperature anomalies of\n450\u2013700 \u25e6C. Allen et al. (2002) present a crustal thickness model\nbroadly similar to that of Darbyshire et al. (2000b) from joint inver-\nsion of surface waveforms and topography, assuming Airy isostatic\ncompensation.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 575\nFigure 4.

Bottom, 1-D velocity profiles at various offsets along the profile relative to an explosion in central Iceland (from Darbyshire et al.\n1998).\nThe structure beneath the Greenland\u2013Iceland and Iceland\u2013Faeroe\nridges has also been investigated in recent explosion seismology\nexperiments. The FIRE profile extended the entire length of the\nIceland\u2013Faeroe ridge, \u223c25 km north of the earlier NASP profile\n(Richardson et al. 1998; Smallwood et al. 1999) (Fig. 1). The crust\nwas found to have a similar structure to that beneath Iceland, with\nan upper crust \u223c10 km thick with high velocity gradients underlain\nby a lower crust with low-velocity gradients. Velocities at the base\nof the crust were \u223cV p = 7.1\u20137.3 km s\u22121 and the depth to the base of\nthe crust was fairly uniform at \u223c30 \u00b1 3 km, shallowing to \u223c25 km\nclose to Iceland. In contrast with Iceland, reflections that could be\ninterpreted as coming from a Moho were not observed, but mantle-\ndiving rays were clear and constrained the upper-mantle velocity to\nV p = 7.7\u20137.9 km s\u22121. The observation of mantle-diving rays indi-\ncates a positive velocity gradient in the uppermost mantle beneath\nthe Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge, and the rarity of such rays beneath Iceland\nsuggests negative velocity gradients there. It is not clear how diving\nrays can exist beneath the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge in the absence of\npost-critical reflections.\nThe structure of the Greenland\u2013Iceland ridge was investigated by\nthe \u223c300 km long SIGMA 1 profile (Holbrook et al. 2001) (Fig. 1).\nThere, the crust was >30 km thick velocities attributed to the lower\ncrust as high as V p = 7.4\u20137.5 km s\u22121.\nS T RU C T U R E O F I C E L A N D I C - T Y P E\nC RU S T F RO M R E C E I V E R F U N C T I O N S\nA homogenous suite of crustal structures from receiver functions\ncovering most of Iceland at regular intervals has recently been\ncompleted using data from the Iceland Hotspot Project (Du &\nFoulger 1999, 2001; Du et al. 2002). This project gathered data\nfrom a network of regularly spaced broad-band seismometers that\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n576 G. R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R. Julian\nFigure 5. Contour map of total crustal thickness determined using a combination of seismic profiles, receiver functions and gravity profiles (from Darbyshire\net al. 2000b).\nwere operated during 1996\u20131998 (Fig. 1), and yielded a large suite\nof well-recorded teleseismic earthquakes (Foulger et al. 2001).\nThe receiver function method uses shear waves generated by\nmode conversion from compressional waves arriving as P phases\nfrom distant earthquakes. It is based on the assumption that for\nsteeply arriving teleseismic wave trains, the vertical-component\nseismograms approximate the incident P waveforms, whereas\nhorizontal-component seismograms are dominated by shear waves\ngenerated by mode conversion at interfaces in the structure beneath\nthe station (Langston 1979). The vertical-component seismogram\nis deconvolved from the two horizontal-component seismograms,\nyielding the response function for the crust beneath the station. This\nis inverted to determine the shear-velocity structure by iteratively\nperturbing an initial model. The method works best for shallow\nstructure, for which the mode-converted signals are best recorded\nat the surface.\nThree significant problems must be overcome if reliable results\nare to be obtained. The first is the velocity\u2013depth ambiguity. Re-\nceiver functions constrain the absolute velocities only weakly, and\nthus independent constraints are required. Du & Foulger (1999,\n2001) and Du et al. (2002) obtained absolute-velocity starting mod-\nels using phase-velocity dispersion of surface waves between station\npairs, which provide local estimates of the average V s structure of\nthe crust, and waveform modelling of large regional events. The\nsecond problem is the sensitivity of the result to the starting model.\nStarting models close to the final model are needed to avoid con-\nvergence to a local rather than a global minimum. Du & Foulger\n(1999, 2001) address this problem using broad suites of initial mod-\nels to initialize inversions and progressively refining the preferred\nstarting model. Du et al. (2002) improved on this approach using\na genetic algorithm, which searches a large model space and finds\nsolutions near to the global minimum. The third problem, that of\nthe high microseismic noise level, is particularly serious in the case\nof data recorded in Iceland. Du & Foulger (1999, 2001) and Du\net al. (2002) suppressed noise by stacking earthquakes from similar\nbackazimuths and filtering the data using a Gaussian low-pass filter\nwith a corner frequency of 1.2 Hz, which corresponds to shear wave-\nlengths of \u223c2\u20134 km. Structures on the scale of \u223c2 km at shallow\ndepth and \u223c2.5 km in the deep crust are resolvable with such data.\nSmaller features are smoothed vertically on this spatial scale.\nDu & Foulger (1999, 2001) and Du et al. (2002) present detailed\nresults for 31 stations covering much of Iceland uniformly. The first-\norder results are (Fig. 6):\n(1) the crust beneath Iceland naturally divides into an upper crust,\nwhich is laterally heterogeneous and characterized by high vertical\nvelocity gradients, and a lower crust, which is less heterogeneous,\nand characterized by low-velocity gradients (Fig. 6a);\n(2) LVZs are common, particularly in the lower crust, and are\nmost extreme and best constrained beneath the MVZ where almost\nthe entire lower crust forms a spatially extensive, strong, coherent\nLVZ with velocities as low as V s = 3.4 km s\u22121 (corresponding to\nV p = 6.0 km s\u22121) at depths of >20 km (Fig. 6b);\n(3) the transition from velocities characteristic of the crust (V s \u2264\n4.1 km s\u22121, V p \u2264 7.2 km s\u22121) to velocities characteristic of the\nmantle (V s \u223c 4.45 km s\u22121, V p \u223c 7.8 km s\u22121) occurs over a depth\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 577\n0\n20\n40\nD\nep\nth\n (k\nm)\n2 3 4 5\nS-velocity\nHOT06.NE\n0\n20\n40\n \n2 3 4 5\nS-velocity\nHVE.SW\n0\n20\n40\n \n2 3 4 5\nS-velocity\nHOT08.N\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 6.

(2002) map variations\nin the depths to the V s = 3.7 and 4.1 km s\u22121 velocity contours\n(V p = 6.5 and 7.2 km s\u22121, assuming V p\/V s = 1.76), these being\ntypical values used for the bases of the upper and lower crusts in\nother studies (Fig. 7). In particular, there is fairly good agreement\nbetween the V s = 4.1 km s\u22121 horizon and the reflective horizon\nassigned to the Moho in explosion seismology experiments. Using\nthese definitions, the upper crust varies in thickness from \u223c6 to\n11 km (Fig. 7a). It is exceptionally thick in the extreme south of\nIceland where a value of 11 km was obtained for station 22 (Figs 1\nand 7a). The unusually thick upper crust there was noted in earlier\nstudies (e.g. Flovenz 1980) and its cause is unknown. Apart from this\nanomalous region, the upper crust has a rather uniform thickness of\n\u223c7 \u00b1 1 km. The small variations observed do not correlate in any\nobvious way with surface tectonics, except for a tendency for the\nupper crust to be slightly thicker beneath the Trollaskagi block in\nnorth Iceland.\nThe depth to the V s = 4.1 km s\u22121 velocity contour, assigned to\nthe base of the lower crust, varies from \u223c20 to 40 km (Fig. 7b).\nThe crust is thickest where the MVZ, NVZ and EVZ converge in\ncentral Iceland, which is also coincident with the general centre\nof the \u223c120 mGal Bouguer gravity low over Iceland. The crust\nthins rapidly to the southwest and is shallowest there and in western\nIceland. Corresponding shallowing is not observed in the north and\neast, where a minimum crustal thickness of \u223c27 km is detected.\nAdditional receiver function results for eight stations in central\nand north Iceland are reported by Darbyshire et al. (2000a). They\nused single earthquakes and different starting models, and suppress\nstructure required by parts of the receiver function wave train later\nthan \u223c11 s, corresponding to depths >\u223c25 km, where they deem their\ndata unreliable because of noise. These methodological differences\nresult in radical differences between some of their models and those\nof Du & Foulger (2001), who studied some common stations. These\ndifferences illustrate the sensitivity of receiver function results to\ndata analysis methodology and the problem of combining results\nobtained using different approaches. In particular, the approach of\nDarbyshire et al. (2000a) precludes detection of major LVZs such\nas that beneath the MVZ. The first-order features of the two sets of\nresults agree, however. Darbyshire et al. (2000a) also find a distinct\ndivision of the crust into two main parts on the basis of velocity gra-\ndients. LVZs of varying thicknesses and amplitudes were detected\nin the lower crust, and most of the structures derived from their in-\nversions exhibit gradational crust\u2013mantle boundaries up to several\nkilometres thick.\nC O M PA R I S O N O F R E S U LT S F RO M\nR E C E I V E R F U N C T I O N S A N D\nE X P L O S I O N S E I S M O L O G Y\nDifferences in methodology\nThe formal errors associated with the receiver functions, using the\nmethod of Du & Foulger (1990, 2001) and Du et al. (2002) are\ntypically up to \u223c2.5 km in depth (the thickness of the thickest layer\nmodelled) and \u00b10.1 km s\u22121 in V s in the deeper part of the crust\n(Fig. 6). The formal error in modern explosion seismology studies\nof the depth to the deep reflector is \u00b12 km (e.g. Darbyshire et al.\n1998). However, intrinsic problems in all the methods used cause\nmuch larger variations in the results than the simple formal misfits\nto the data imply.\nThe receiver-function method contrasts fundamentally with ex-\nplosion seismology. A receiver function is derived from waves with\nfrequencies of the order of 0.1 Hz, and thus samples an area some\ntens of kilometres in diameter around a station. It is most sensitive\nto reflections caused by large variations in impedance (the prod-\nuct of density and shear wave velocity), comparatively insensitive\nto absolute velocities, and its sensitivity is largely independent of\ndepth within the crust. It can detect velocity reversals as easily as\nvelocity increases with depth. Explosion seismology, on the other\nhand, involves much higher-frequency waves, samples relatively\nnarrow zones along linear profiles and is most sensitive to later-\nally averaged absolute compressional-wave velocity at a few partic-\nular depths where the rays corresponding to observed waves have\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n578 G.

It is also sensitive to major zones of rapid or dis-\ncontinuous velocity increase with depth, which focus rays to pro-\nduce large, later-arriving, post-critically \u2018reflected\u2019 waves, and to\nthe structure of shallow regions, for which the ray density tends\nto be high and wave amplitudes are large. It is relatively insensitive\nto structure in the deeper crust, which is sampled only by small, later-\narriving waves, and it is insensitive to velocity reversals, which lead\nto traveltime curves the structural interpretation of which is mathe-\nmatically ambiguous, even for 1-D models and complete and error-\nfree data. For most of the explosion profiles in Iceland, velocity near\nthe base of the lower crust is not constrained, but estimated by down-\nward extrapolation of velocity gradients (e.g. Staples et al. 1997;\nDarbyshire et al. 1998). Furthermore, the error in the depth to the\nbase of the crust obtained by combining explosion seismic results\nand gravity data (Fig. 5; Darbyshire et al. 2000b) is large and diffi-\ncult to quantify because of the serious problem of correctly assigning\ndensity.\nThese fundamental differences in methods mean that receiver-\nfunction and explosion-seismology results are not directly compa-\nrable. The V s models obtained from receiver functions cannot be\nrelated in a simple way to the V p models obtained from explosion\nseismology if there are variations in the V p\/V s ratio or in the relative\nattenuation of compressional and shear waves. These are, further-\nmore, expected consequences of variable petrology, anisotropy, par-\ntial melting and the presence of fluids and hydrothermal systems.\nA clear illustration of this point is provided by Darbyshire et al.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 579\n(2000a), who used receiver functions from station REN (Fig. 1)\nto determine structure beneath the Krafla central volcano, near the\nnorthern end of the FIRE explosion profile. They detected a LVZ\n5 km thick at the top of the lower crust. This volume was well sam-\npled by crossing rays of the FIRE profile (Staples et al. 1997), but\nsynthetic seismogram modelling showed that even in this, a part of\nthe crust best sampled by explosion seismology, that method could\nnot detect such a LVZ if it exists (Darbyshire et al. 2000a).\nBoth the receiver-function and explosion methods suffer from\ninherent ambiguities. The receiver-function model space is large\n(roughly 25 free parameters) and must be searched efficiently to en-\nsure that the starting model is close to the global minimum. Receiver\nfunctions depend on structure in a complicated way, so sophisticated\nmethods such as genetic algorithms must be used to search for mod-\nels that are globally optimal. Explosion seismology observations\nare usually analysed by forward modelling techniques, which do\nnot provide estimates of uncertainties in the derived models. The\nambiguity problem with explosion data is most severe in the deeper\ncrust.\nSimilarities in the results\nNotwithstanding the fundamental differences in methodology, es-\nsentially all modern seismic studies of Icelandic crust agree that high\nvelocity gradients and extreme heterogeneity characterize the shal-\nlow crust, which is a few kilometres thick, and that velocity gradients\nan order of magnitude smaller and a greater degree of homogeneity\ncharacterize the lower crust, which is \u223c15\u201330 \u00b1 5 km thick. There\nis no evidence that upper Icelandic crust compacts with age as nor-\nmal oceanic crust does, since no thinning of the upper crust from\nyounger to older parts of Iceland is observed. The thickness of the\nupper crust, and the depth to the crust\u2013mantle boundary determined\nfrom receiver functions are in general agreement with the results\nfrom explosion seismology, considering the significantly different\ndefinitions of these features in common use (Table 1). The simi-\nlarities in the pan-Iceland maps of crustal thickness from receiver\nfunctions (Fig. 7b), and explosion seismology\/gravity (Darbyshire\net al. 2000b) (Fig. 5) are:\n(1) the crust is thickest beneath central Iceland, where it is up to\n\u223c40 km thick;\n(2) crustal thickness is asymmetric north\u2013south and east\u2013west;\n(3) the crust thins to 20\u201325 km beneath south and west Iceland,\nbut is >\u223c30 km almost to the coast beneath much of north Iceland;\nand\n(4) the crust is \u223c30 km thick or more beneath eastern Iceland,\nwhere it is significantly thicker than crust of the same age in western\nIceland.\nDifferences in the results\nReceiver functions typically yield more complex structures than\nexplosion seismology, with velocity reversals on a wide range of\nscales being common. Significant LVZs occur in the lower crust in\napproximately half of the \u223c80 receiver functions of Du & Foulger\n(1999, 2001) and Du et al. (2002). These vary from being thin to\noccupying most of the lower crust. Explosion seismology usually\ncannot constrain such velocity reversals. Models without reversals\nmay fit the explosion data, but the data cannot rule out reversals.\nLVZs may be more pronounced in V s than in V p, and thus repre-\nsent zones of high V p\/V s. A comprehensive map of V p\/V s across\nIceland could significantly improve our knowledge of lower crustal\nLVZs. However, although V p and V s have been well investigated\nover Iceland separately, using explosion seismology and receiver\nfunctions, respectively, such a map cannot yet be produced because\nthe methods differ so fundamentally that the combined errors would\nbe larger than the variations. LVZs are not generally modelled for\nexplosion seismology data and thus the full range of models compat-\nible with the data is not known. The most significant LVZ detected\nby receiver functions occupies an area of >10 000 km2 of the MVZ\nand has velocities up to \u223c8 per cent low throughout the depth in-\nterval \u223c20\u201335 km (Du & Foulger 1999, 2001; Du et al. 2002). The\nICEMELT profile passed near the periphery of this zone and an ap-\nparent shadow zone may be seen in the published sections, though\nit was not interpreted (Darbyshire et al. 1998). The possibility that\nthis LVZ in V s is also associated with a LVZ in V p has thus not yet\nbeen investigated.\nOn high-quality explosion seismology profiles, clear post-critical\nreflections are usually detected from depths of \u223c20\u201340 km. These\nare generally interpreted as indicating a simple, relatively sharp,\nlaterally extensive Moho with a velocity jump of V p = 0.45\u2013\n0.95 km s\u22121 (corresponding to V s = 0.25\u20130.55 km s\u22121, assuming\nV p\/V s = 1.76). Such a discontinuity is not detected by the receiver\nfunctions, however, which indicate that a gradational crust\u2013mantle\nboundary several kilometres thick is most common (Fig. 6). This is\nan important point, since receiver functions are powerful for detect-\ning sharp reflective discontinuities if they exist.\nNote that variations in the maps of total crustal thickness include:\n(1) the locus of thickest crust determined using receiver functions\nis centred on the confluence of the MVZ, NVZ and EVZ (Foulger\net al. 2000, 2001), whereas explosion seismology\/gravity suggests\nit underlies northwest Vatnajokull;\n(2) the crust beneath the Tertiary surface rocks east of\nVatnajokull is significantly thinner in the receiver-function model\nthan in the explosion seismology\/gravity model (cf. Figs 7b and 5).\nReconciling the receiver function and explosion\nseismology results\nTo reconcile the receiver-function and explosion-seismology results,\nwe investigated the most significant differences in the models: sharp\nfirst-order Moho discontinuities and the absence of crustal LVZs\nin published explosion-seismology models. Comparing published\nexplosion seismic data with theoretical seismograms computed us-\ning a modern, full-wave reflectivity method (Kennett 1983; Randall\n1989), we found that the interpretation of seismic-refraction data is\nnot unique; there is a trade-off between crustal thickness and the\nsharpness of the Moho discontinuity. The largest possible crustal\nthicknesses correspond to sharp first-order Moho discontinuities,\nand transitional zones several kilometres thick are compatible with\nsmaller crustal thicknesses and higher wave speeds in the lower\ncrust. Furthermore, the explosion data are consistent with the pres-\nence of crustal LVZs, and in many cases contain strong evidence for\nthem.\nA transitional crust\u2013mantle boundary\nReceiver functions rule out a sharp Moho discontinuity with \u0006V p >\u223c\n0.5 km s\u22121 (\u0006V s >\u223c 0.3 km s\u22121) occurring over a depth interval\nof less than 2 km because it would produce strong near-vertical\nreflections that are not observed. This is shown by synthetic receiver-\nfunction modelling that shows that a strong, sharp discontinuity\nwould generate clear Ps and PpPms converted phases, which are not\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n580 G.

Such peaks are not observed in the data. The large trough at \u223c6 s in the observed receiver function at station\n26 requires a substantial low-velocity zone in the lower crust (Du & Foulger 2001).\nobserved (Fig. 8). Seismic refraction data also place constraints on\nthe sharpness of the Moho for similar reasons: sharp discontinuities\nproduce larger pre-critical reflected waves. Fig. 9 shows observed\nseismograms for the Reydarfjordur shot of the FIRE experiment\n(Staples et al. 1997) (Fig. 1), and compares them with synthetic\nseismograms computed using the reflectivity program of Kennett\n(1983) and Randall (1989). A model with a sharp Moho at 29 km\ndepth was used (Fig. 10, dashed line), which is the approximate depth\nto the crust\u2013mantle boundary determined by receiver functions in the\narea. The later-arriving PmP phase on the theoretical seismograms\nis the most prominent arrival at distances beyond approximately\n65 km, whereas on observed records it is essentially undetectable\nat distances of less than 100 km. The Reydarfjordur data are quite\nconsistent, however, with a transitional boundary at this depth, such\nas that shown as a solid line in Fig. 10. The seismograms computed\nfrom this model (Figs 11f and g) strongly resemble the observed data\n(Figs 11a and b), with the PmP phase being the dominant arrival\nat distances beyond 100 km, and essentially undetectable at shorter\ndistances.\nIt is possible to fit the observed amplitude\u2013distance relation of\nthese data fairly well with a sharp Moho if it is 35 km deep, as is\nillustrated in fig. 13 of Staples et al. (1997), and if the wave speed is\nhigher in the lower crust (so the velocity discontinuity at the Moho is\nsmaller). However, this depth is significantly larger than that found\nfrom receiver functions in this area (Fig. 7b), and is not compatible\nwith those data.\nMid-crustal LVZs\nThe upper- and lower-crustal LVZs common in models derived from\nreceiver functions are not ruled out by explosion seismology, which\nin fact provides evidence in support of such features. Apparent\nshadow zones starting at distances of 60\u2013120 km are visible in\nseveral published seismogram record sections (e.g. Staples et al.\n1997, Figs 4, 6, 7 and 8), and can be explained by LVZs in the lower\ncrust. Both ray-theoretical traveltime curves and full-wave reflec-\ntivity seismograms agree well with the observations. If LVZs are\nnot accounted for in interpreting explosion seismology data, then\nthe depths to deeper discontinuities and the magnitudes of their\nvelocity jumps are overestimated. Such errors may partly account\nfor the differences in crustal thicknesses obtained from explosion\nseismology and receiver functions. In particular, LVZs are expected\nbeneath the major volcano cluster under northwest Vatnajokull, and\nare required there by receiver functions (Du & Foulger 2001).\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 581\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nT-\n\u2206\/\n7,\n s\nT-\u2206\n\/7\n, s\nT-\u2206\n\/7\n, s\nT-\n\u2206\/\n7,\n s\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nDistance \u2206, km\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n050100150200\nFigure 9.

A sharp Moho at 29 km predicts large reflected later arrivals at distances less\nthan 100 km that are not observed.\nFig. 11 illustrates the compatibility of the Reydarfjordur shot data\nwith a model having an upper-crustal LVZ (Fig. 10). Curvature of the\nfirst-arrival traveltime curves at distances of less than approximately\n50 km implies that wave speeds increase rapidly in the upper \u223c5 km.\nFor the Reydarfjordur profile, V p reaches 6 km s\u22121 at the unusually\nshallow depth of approximately 1 km (on other profiles it is a few km\ndeeper) and a further rapid increase to 6.5 km s\u22121 occurs at 5 km\ndepth. This increase causes a triplication in the traveltime curve,\nwith large later arrivals from approximately 20 to 40 km distance,\nand a new branch becomes the first arrival at approximately 40 km.\nThe large later arrivals of the triplication also occur in the surface-\nreflected PP phase, which are clear on the theoretical seismograms\nat approximately 55\u201390 km distance (Fig. 11f). These waves are\nalso detectable on the low-pass filtered observed seismograms, but\nthey are weak, probably because of heterogeneity near the surface\nreflection point. The new first-arrival branch has small amplitudes,\nand cannot be seen beyond approximately 60 km, where a larger\nbranch, delayed by approximately 0.3 s, begins.

Fig. 11\nshows similar predictions for the structure indicated by the continuous line.\nBold lines indicate depths from which turning rays are observable as first\narrivals or large later arrivals, and for which the wave speed, and to some\nextent its gradient, are well constrained. The LVZ near the top of the lower\ncrust is required by rapid amplitude decreases and traveltime offsets seen on\nthe Reydarfjordur and other published profiles from Iceland, but its shape is\nnot unique. The LVZ shown is at the extreme end of what is consistent with\nthe data.\nare characteristic of a shadow zone caused by an LVZ such as that in\nthe depth interval from approximately 6 to 10 km in Fig. 10. Similar\nevidence of shadow zones is observed on three other shots (Staples\net al. 1997, Figs 7, 8 and 10).\nAs is always the case, the velocity variation within the LVZ can-\nnot be uniquely determined from surface-focus traveltimes, so the\nthickness of the zone and the large velocity contrast shown in Fig. 10\nare arbitrary. Furthermore, variations in the position of the shadow\nzone from shot to shot indicate that the upper crust is laterally in-\nhomogeneous. Rays bottoming between approximately 15 km and\nthe base of the crust are not observed. They are either small later ar-\nrivals or emerge beyond the furthest seismic station. The explosion\ndata are therefore compatible with the presence of LVZs and other\nfeatures in the lower crust, but do not require them.\nWaves bottoming below the crust\u2013mantle boundary are not ob-\nserved, and must be small or absent. Both for geometrical rays (Julian\n& Anderson 1968) and for diffracted waves (Hill 1971), amplitudes\nare extremely sensitive to the velocity gradient at the bottom of a ray.\nThe absence of rays bottoming below the crust\u2013mantle boundary is\nthus most simply explained by a low or negative velocity gradient,\nalthough anelastic attenuation may also play a role.\nAnelastic wave attenuation\nThe theoretical seismograms shown in Figs 9(c), (d), 11(f) and (g)\nwere computed using anelasticity models based on the work of\nMenke & Levin (1994) and Menke et al. (1995). In the upper 4 km\nQp = 60 and Qs = 100, and both values increase with depth, reach-\ning values of Qp = 800 and Qs = 1500 at 12 km depth. In the lower\ncrust, Menke et al. (1995) infer slightly increased shear wave atten-\nuation (Qs = 800) but negligible compressional-wave attenuation\n(Qp > 5000). However, we find that such values predict PmP am-\nplitudes much larger than are observed. Below 16 km we use Qp =\n150 and Qs = 500, values that give amplitudes similar to those\nobserved.\nIn the NVZ, Staples et al. (1997) observe PmP-like arrivals at\nshorter distances and earlier times than elsewhere, and they inter-\npret these in terms of crustal thinning from 34 to 20 km. The resulting\nmodel predicts diving waves (Pn) as first arrivals where none are\nobserved, from which Staples et al. (1997) infer extraordinarily high\nattenuation (Qp < 20) in the mantle. An alternative explanation is\nthat the observed waves are reflected from thin LVZs at approxi-\nmately 20 km and not from the crust\u2013mantle boundary. This would\nalso explain the lack of the \u223c40 mGal gravity anomaly predicted\nby such an extreme mantle updoming. This must otherwise be can-\ncelled out by invoking strong density anomalies in the mantle, which\nimply an implausible 700 \u25e6C temperature anomaly, and for which\nthere is no independent evidence.\nA structural model that satisfies all seismic data\nAs illustrated above, the explosion seismology data are compatible\nwith the receiver functions. The receiver functions require LVZs\nin the crust, and the explosion data show evidence of these in the\nshallow crust and are insensitive to such zones in the lower crust.\nReceiver functions rule out a sharp velocity discontinuity at the\nbase of the crust, and a crust\u2013mantle transition zone that is either\ngradational or comprises thin, alternating, high- and low-velocity\nlayers is consistent with both types of data. The structural resolution\nof the receiver functions at the base of the crust is \u223c2.5 km and for\na zone of thin layers the inversion process will yield a smoothed\nprofile with velocities averaged on that scale. Such a structure was\nsuggested for a reflective horizon detected by explosion seismology\nin the lower crust west of the SW tip of the Reykjanes peninsula by\nWeir et al. (2001). This boundary was not identified as the Moho\nonly because of gravity modelling and the observation of deeper\nreflectors. If the crust\u2013mantle transition zone does contain such fine\nstructure, the reflections detected by explosion seismology profiles\nmight then come either from the shallowest high-velocity layer or\nfrom constructive interference of reflections throughout much of the\nstack.\nFig. 12 illustrates the first-order structural models proposed for\nIcelandic-type crust from explosion seismology data (Fig. 12a) and\nreceiver functions (Fig. 12b). These figures show those features of\nthe crust in Iceland reported from most locations, and local de-\ntail is omitted. They are similar except for the nature of the crust\u2013\nmantle transition zone, illustrating that the first-order results from\nthe two methods are similar.

Its vertical and lateral heterogeneity\nprobably results from its composition of a me\u00b4lange of lava flows,\nsubsided hyaloclastites, intrusions of all geometries and small, lo-\ncal magma bodies, in particular beneath central volcanoes (e.g.\nFoulger & Toomey 1989; Foulger et al. 1995). Its petrological vari-\nability may result from the remelting of subsided, hydrated basalts\n(Oskarsson et al. 1982) or from source heterogeneity (Foulger et al.\n2002). The average seismic velocity increases rapidly downwards\nbecause of compaction due to increasing overburden pressure and\nmineralization. These progressively close cracks and pores, and in-\ncrease the metamorphic grade from zeolite through chlorite-epidote\nand greenschist to amphibolite facies (e.g. Oskarsson et al. 1982;\nFlovenz & Gunnarsson 1991). It has been suggested that the base\nof the oceanic upper crust, at \u223c3 km depth, represents the depth at\nwhich all cracks and pores are closed as a result of overburden pres-\nsure. This is unlikely, however, since open cracks exist in Icelandic\ncrust down to at least 7 km, where pressures are much greater. This\nis known from non-double-couple earthquakes, the source of which\nprocesses involve the opening and closing of cracks (Foulger 1988;\nFoulger et al. 1989; Miller et al. 1998a,b). The base of the upper\ncrust is also unlikely to correspond to a single metamorphic horizon,\nsuch as the transition from amphibolite to granulite facies, because\nthen a systematic thinning of the upper crust over the rift zones,\nwhere geothermal gradients are high, would be predicted, but this is\nnot observed (Fig. 7a). By analogy with ophiolites, the base of the\nupper crust probably corresponds to the transition from basaltic to\ngabbroic petrology (Mutter & Mutter 1993).\nThe lower crust\nThe Icelandic lower crust probably corresponds to oceanic layer 3,\nwhich in ophiolites is a largely gabbroic sequence in the amphibo-\nlite to granulite metamorphic facies. Epidote is probably also im-\nportant in the lower crust (Christensen & Wilkins 1982; Flovenz &\nGunnarsson 1991). The velocity which marks the top of the lower\ncrust, V p \u223c 6.5 km s\u22121, is approximately the upper limit of velocities\nin unfractured basalt (Mutter & Mutter 1993). However, increasing\npressure in basalt alone is not sufficient to explain higher velocities.\nA change in petrology, probably to gabbro, is required, and veloci-\nties deep in the lower crust of V p >\u223c 7.1 km s\u22121 require an ultramafic\ncomponent.\nThe LVZs that are a significant feature of the lower crust may re-\nsult from variations in temperature, petrology, metamorphic facies\nor the presence of fluids, especially magma, and such variations\nare also required to explain the reflective horizons occasionally ob-\nserved in the lower crust (e.g. Weir et al. 2001). The low atten-\nuation observed for shear waves in the lower crust permits only\nsmall percentages of pervasive partial melt (Menke & Levin 1994).\nSlightly higher shear wave attenuation observed beneath central Ice-\nland compared with south Iceland may indicate temperatures \u223c75\u25e6C\nhotter beneath central Iceland (Menke & Levin 1994), which would\ncorrespond to a reduction in V s of \u223c1.5 per cent (Humphreys &\nDueker 1994). This is less than the maximum of \u223c8 per cent ob-\nserved. The remaining anomaly could be explained by less than\n1 per cent partial melt, which would depress V s much more than\nV p. V p\/V s might then be as high as \u223c1.9 beneath the MVZ, but its\nvalue in that region has not been measured to date.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 585\nThe crust\u2013mantle boundary\nThe seismological Moho was first observed beneath Europe, where\nit comprises a velocity discontinuity of \u223c1.0 km s\u22121 in V p. A seismic\ndiscontinuity, or rapid increase in velocity, is also widespread at the\nbase of the oceanic crust, but is usually weaker, typically \u223c0.6\u2013\n0.8 km s\u22121 in V p. Laboratory experiments on ophiolites suggest\nthat the oceanic seismological Moho corresponds to the boundary\nbetween layered gabbros with some interlayered peridotites above,\nand harzburgite and dunites below (Fig. 2).\nPetrological models predict that, if oceanic crust is formed from\npartially melting mantle peridotite, a high-velocity, dunite-rich ma-\nterial is deposited at the base of the crust (e.g. Farnetani et al. 1996).\nFor peridotite, the greater the depth of melting, the more potential\nolivine is contained in the melt (e.g. Herzberg & O\u2019Hara 1998).\nLow-degree partial melting of peridotites at depths of >\u223c70 km pro-\nduces picritic melt, which contains more olivine than the tholeiitic\nlavas erupted at the surface (e.g. Stolper 1980), and higher MgO\ncontent (15\u201318 wt per cent MgO, compared with 6\u20138 wt per cent\nin surface-erupted tholeiites). These differences require that signif-\nicant quantities of olivine and MgO are removed from the melt by\nfractional crystallization before eruption at the surface. Fractiona-\ntion is expected to occur preferentially near the base of the crust,\na major change in composition, density and rheology and thus a\npotential impediment to upward movement of dense melts. Petro-\nlogical models therefore predict a distinct, dunite-rich, high-velocity\nlayer at the base of the crust, comprising olivine, augitic pyroxene,\nand, at depths shallower than \u223c30 km, variable amounts of plagio-\nclase. Kelemen et al. (1997) have suggested that replacive dunites\nmark conduits for focused porous flow of MORB melt in the mantle,\nand provide the geochemical isolation from surrounding peridotite\nthat is required by observations that residual peridotites are not in\nequilibrium with MORB.\nThe gradational removal of plagioclase with depth through its\ncombination with olivine to form clinopyroxene would also con-\ntribute to gradational downwards velocity increase with depth. The\nhigh-velocity basal crustal layer may thus comprise a pile of thinner\nlayers with various petrological compositions, including both crustal\ncumulates and interleaved mantle peridotites (Cox 1980; Kelemen &\nAharonov 1998, and references therein) throughout which velocities\nrise from lower-crustal to upper-mantle values. Such interleaving is\nobserved in the field, e.g. in the Rum intrusion and the Great Dyke\nof Zimbabwe (Huppert & Sparks 1980; Singh & McKenzie 1993).\nThe layer is expected to exhibit seismic velocities in the range V p \u223c\n7.5\u20137.9 km s\u22121. The absence of such a layer would require that the\nmelting that supplied crustal material occurred at depths of \u226430 km,\nwhich is not possible since it would then be occurring within the\n\u223c30 km thick crust itself. The model proposed here also predicts\nolivine gabbroic intrusions with V p \u223c 6.8\u20137.0 km s\u22121 in the upper\ncrust, which are indeed observed in Iceland.\nSuch a petrological model accounts for the broad, first-order fea-\ntures of the gradational crust\u2013mantle transition zone beneath Ice-\nland, if it is assumed that the thick Icelandic crust is formed from\nessentially similar but scaled-up processes to normal oceanic crust.\nIf Icelandic-type crust is up to \u223c40 km thick, and if the thickness of\nthe basal zone is \u223c20 per cent of the overlying crust, its thickness\nwould increase from approximately 3 to 8 km between the coast\nand central Iceland. If it is assumed that melting occurs beneath\nthe crust, the average melting depth will be greatest beneath the\nthickest crust, and the model would predict that a slightly thicker\ncrust\u2013mantle transition zone would occur there. Plagioclase, which\nhas relatively low velocities, would be expected to form a compo-\nnent in the crust\u2013mantle transition zone shallower than \u223c30 km.\nThis would tend to suppress the seismological contrast between the\ncrust\u2013mantle transition zone and the overlying lower crust beneath\nthinner parts of the Icelandic crust, and reduce the apparent thick-\nness of the transition zone. It is not clear why the phase change\nassociated with the disappearance of plagioclase is not associated\nwith a clear seismological horizon beneath Iceland or elsewhere in\nthick oceanic crust.\nIf the crust varies from <20 km to \u223c40 km thick, the composition\nof lowest crustal material must also vary laterally. Pyroxene horn-\nfels facies assemblages, in which plagioclase is stable with olivine,\nwill not be stable in those parts of the crust >\u223c30 km deep, where\nthe olivine and plagioclase will combine and a pyroxene granulite\nwill result. If temperatures are low at the base of the crust, garnet\nmight also be present in varying amounts, forming garnet-granulites.\nHornblende might also occur if sufficient water is present. Such vari-\nations in petrology affect seismic velocity and may contribute to the\ngradational nature of the crust\u2013mantle boundary.\nThe gradational crust\u2013mantle transition zone suggests a down-\nwards increase in abundance of high-velocity rocks such as\ndunite and harzburgite compared with lower-velocity pyroxenites,\nwehrlites and troctolites rather than an abrupt transition from one\npetrology to another. Such a model also helps to explain the anoma-\nlously low density contrast of 2\u20134 per cent between the lower crust\nand mantle predicted by isostasy, which is consistent with only mi-\nnor changes in composition between the crust and mantle (Menke\n1999; Darbyshire et al. 2000b). Assuming maximum basal veloci-\nties of V p = 7.1\u20137.3 km s\u22121, Menke (1999) finds that the effects of\nreasonable mantle thermal, entrainment and depletion effects can-\nnot fully account for such a small density contrast with the crust.\nSimply put, this means that if a model is assumed that comprises\na lower crust, separated from the upper mantle by a sharp, or thin\ntransition zone, isostatic considerations require that the density of\nthe lower crust is inexplicably high. A crust\u2013mantle transition zone\n\u223c20 per cent of total crustal thickness and with an average velocity\nof V p \u223c 7.5 km s\u22121 would account for much of the unexplained dis-\ncrepancy. A small crust\u2013mantle boundary density contrast would\nfurther encourage polybaric crystalization and the distribution of\nolivine throughout a relatively large depth range as melt ascends.\nLike the lower-crustal LVZs, the slight velocity reversal beneath the\ncrust\u2013mantle transition zone suggested by the rarity of observed\nmantle-diving rays in Iceland might be explained by a high geother-\nmal gradient at the top of the mantle underneath much of Iceland.\nHowever, there is no direct seismic evidence from anomalously high\nV p\/V s ratios or attenuation for melt at the base of the crust or in\nthe crust\u2013mantle transition zone. The apparent lack of a velocity re-\nversal in the topmost mantle beneath the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge (Bott\n& Gunnarsson 1980; Smallwood et al. 1999) is consistent with the\nlithospheric mantle there having cooled as it was transported away\nfrom the ridge by plate motion.\nIt has recently been suggested that much of the great crustal\nthickness at Iceland may result from the melting of eclogite in the\nCaledonian suture, still remaining in the upper mantle beneath\nIceland, and not entirely from peridotite partial melt (Foulger 2002;\nFoulger et al. 2002, 2003). In this case, large quantities of frac-\ntionated dunite at the crust\u2013mantle transition would not be ex-\npected. An alternative model to explain the gradational crust\u2013mantle\ntransition zone and the unusually small density contrast between\nthe lower crust and the mantle might then be gradation between\ncrustal and mantle rocks over a depth interval of tens of kilo-\nmetres rather than the few kilometres proposed for oceanic crust\n(Cannat 1996). Such a diffuse gradation might be a consequence of\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n586 G. R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R. Julian\nthe exceptionally large and vigorous flux of melt from the mantle,\nand raises the question of what the true relationship is between the\nseismological and the magmatic thickness of Icelandic-type crust.\nVA R I AT I O N I N C RU S TA L T H I C K N E S S\nB E N E AT H T H E I C E L A N D\nT R A N S V E R S E R I D G E\nBecause the crust\u2013mantle transition zone is gradational, and un-\ndetected LVZs and multiple reflectors may exist in the deep crust,\nthere is likely to be significant uncertainty in estimates of crustal\nthickness both in the receiver function and explosion seismology\nresults. Nevertheless, it is tempting to view maps of crustal thick-\nness over the Iceland transverse ridge as snapshots of the top of\na plume beneath central Iceland or northwest Vatnajokull that de-\nlivers an anomalously large amount of melt and creates the great\nthickness of crust there. However, careful consideration of the ob-\nservations reveals difficulties with this interpretation. Since crustal\nspreading is ongoing, if a plume underlies central Iceland, the crust\nwould be expected to have a uniform thickness of \u223c40 km parallel\nto the spreading direction. This is not the case. The crustal thick-\nness falls rapidly to \u223c25 km within \u223c200 km west of the thickest\nspot and to \u223c30 km at a similar distance to the east. Beneath the\nGreenland\u2013Iceland ridge the crust is \u223c33 km thick and beneath the\nIceland\u2013Faeroe ridge it is \u223c25\u201330 km thick. Furthermore, there is no\nevidence from seismic attenuation, petrology or geochemistry for\nhigh temperatures beneath central Iceland compared with coastal\nregions.\nThe exceptionally large crustal thickness beneath central Ice-\nland detected by receiver functions is best explained as a foundered\noceanic microplate (see Foulger 2002, 2003 and references therein).\nIn the region that is currently north Iceland, a second rift zone, par-\nallel to the MAR, formed \u223c26 Ma. An oceanic microplate \u223c100 km\nwide containing Icelandic-type crust up to \u223c33 Myr old was cap-\ntured between this and the MAR. Tectonic reconstructions show\nthat this microplate currently underlies central Iceland. Surface lava\nflows have thus been added to the existing crust since \u223c26 Ma, and\nthe oldest exposed rock at the surface is currently \u223c12 Myr old\n(Saemundsson 1979). Lava accumulation rates near the rift zones in\nIceland are typically 1\u20132 km Ma\u22121 and thus a growth in thickness of\n\u223c10 km of crust originally \u223c30 km thick is in accord with models\nof crustal growth in Iceland. This model explains the extensive LVZ\nin the lower crust since it suggests that the upper part of the lower\ncrust is subsided, former upper crustal material.\nOther possible explanations for the exceptionally thick crust be-\nneath the centre of Iceland include a very recent increase in magma\nproduction locally beneath central Iceland. This would imply an\nephemeral process that has not previously occurred since the open-\ning of the Atlantic 54 Ma and is inconsistent with a progressively\ndeclining plume. It would also imply that the observed \u2018plume-like\u2019\npattern of crustal thickness is a fortuitous consequence of our hap-\npening to look at the moment of maximum melt production in the\nhistory of the hotspot, and that it would not have been observed\nhad crustal thickness been mapped at any other time. Shallowing of\nthe seismological base of the crust with age might also explain the\nobservations. Kinematic modelling predicts that the crust cools as\nit subsides and is transported laterally away from the spreading axis\n(e.g. Palmason 1980; Menke & Sparks 1995). The apparent addi-\ntional \u223c10 km of crustal thickness beneath central Iceland might\nthen be an artefact of locally high temperatures and partial melt that\ndepresses velocities in the uppermost mantle to crustal values. Es-\ntimates of seismic attenuation argue against this, however. Staples\n(1997) has suggested that the crust may be \u223c40 km thick every-\nwhere beneath the Icelandic transverse ridge but that the lowermost\n\u223c10 km of crust transforms from gabbro to higher-velocity garnet\ngranulite over tens of millions of years, and is mistakenly identi-\nfied as upper mantle. The thick crust does not, however, underly the\ncurrently active rift zones everywhere, and so this argument would\napply to crust formed at the centre of Iceland only.\nThe east\u2013west asymmetry in crustal thickness about central\nIceland (Figs 5 and 7b) argues against the theory that a plume has\nmigrated eastwards from beneath Greenland since the opening of the\nNorth Atlantic (e.g. Vink 1984; Lawver & Muller 1994). This theory\npredicts that a plume underlay north\u2013west Iceland \u223c20 Ma, subse-\nquently migrated SE across Iceland, and now underlies Vatnajokull.\nSuch a model would predict thicker crust in the wake of the plume\nbeneath the Greenland\u2013Iceland ridge and north\u2013west Iceland, and\nthinner crust beneath eastern Iceland and the Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridge,\nahead of the plume. Such a pattern is not observed. The crust beneath\nthe Greenland\u2013Iceland and Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridges is approximately\nequally thick. In Iceland, the observed pattern is opposite to that\npredicted, with thinner crust beneath western than eastern Iceland.\nHeat flow is also lower west of the Reykjanes ridge than east of\nit, also arguing against an easterly migrating plume (Stein & Stein\n2003). These results are more consistent with a model whereby the\nsource of excessive melt in the Iceland region has been beneath\nthe MAR since the opening of the North Atlantic (e.g. Bott 1985;\nFoulger et al. 2000, 2001, 2003; Foulger 2002, 2003).\nThe asymmetry of crustal thickness about central Iceland prob-\nably results from crustal accretion having occurred along a parallel\npair of rift zones since \u223c26 Ma (Bott 1985; Foulger 2002). The crust\nbeneath the Western Fjords and eastern Iceland formed \u223c10\u201315 Ma,\nbut along two widely separated rift zones. This is clear from the fact\nthat the \u223c15 Ma isochrons in Iceland are currently \u223c200 km fur-\nther apart than they are across the Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey ridges.\nThus, although there is currently a single spreading zone in north\nIceland (the NVZ), this has probably only been the case for the last\n\u223c7 Myr (Jancin et al. 1985; Foulger 2002). That the crust beneath\nthe Western Fjords and western Iceland is \u223c5 km thinner than cor-\nresponding crust beneath eastern Iceland suggests that the western\nrift zone was less productive than the eastern zone. This is in keep-\ning with its subsequent extinction in favour of the eastern rift zone\n(the NVZ), and the subsidiary nature of crustal accretion in western\nIceland today.\nThe crustal thickness models based on explosion seismology\nshow thinning of the crust to <20 km to the north and south of\ncentral Iceland, locally beneath the EVZ (Darbyshire et al. 2000b)\nand NVZ (Darbyshire et al. 2000b). The gravity field shows no\nanomalies that support such thinning (Eysteinsson & Gunnarsson\n1995). In order to model an essentially flat gravity field with a seis-\nmic structure involving a severely updoming mantle, Staples et al.\n(1997) had to invoke compensating low crustal and mantle densities\nfor which there is no independent evidence. Such thinning is not\nexpected for the following reasons. The EVZ is highly volcanically\nactive, and formed at \u223c2 Ma in pre-existing crust. Only \u223c10 km of\ncrustal widening will have occurred subsequently, assuming spread-\ning to have been shared with the WVZ. Additional volcanic activity\nat this location would be expected to slightly thicken the crust by\nthe addition of surface lava flows and intrusions. In the case of the\nNVZ, locally thin crust is at odds with the agreement of all crustal\nthickness studies that the crust on the flanks is thicker. Anomalously\nthin crust beneath the current NVZ would require that magmatism\nbeneath the NVZ has been significantly reduced for the last several\nMyr. There is no independent evidence for such waning in activity.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\nIcelandic-type crust 587\nD I S C U S S I O N\nCritical to any discussion of crustal thickness in Iceland is a clear\ndefinition of what is meant by the base of the crust. The Mohorovi-\ncic discontinuity was first observed seismically beneath Europe,\nwhere it comprises a strong discontinuity of \u223c1.0 km s\u22121 in V p\n(Mohorovicic 1909). It is often assumed to be sharp, despite the\nfact that pre-critical reflections are then predicted but not observed.\nIts definition is often adapted to whatever is observed in a particular\nstudy area, and it is sometimes even used to describe changes in ve-\nlocity gradient without velocity discontinuities. Vague usage of the\nterm, coupled with the assumption that such a structure separates\nthe crust and mantle everywhere, potentially obscures the geology\nby substituting classification for understanding. Despite the simple,\nelegant crustal subdivision proposed by Flovenz (1980), and widely\naccepted as the most natural for oceanic crust in general, multilayer\nsubdivisions for Icelandic-type crust based on absolute velocity that\nfit the data poorly are still commonly adopted (e.g. Bjarnason et al.\n1993; Darbyshire et al. 1998).\nSeismic models of Icelandic-type crust and underlying upper\nmantle have evolved from an original thick model where velocities\nof V p \u2264 7.2 km s\u22121 were attributed to crust (Ba\u02dath 1960; Zverev\net al. 1976) through a thin\u2013hot crust model, where material of\nV p \u2265 7.0 km s\u22121 was attributed to partially molten upper mantle\nat temperatures of >1100 \u25e6C (Tryggvason 1962; Palmason 1971;\nAngenheister et al. 1980; Gebrande et al. 1980) and back to a thick\u2013\ncold crust model, with material of V p \u223c 7.2 km s\u22121 attributed to sub-\nsolidus crust with temperatures of <\u223c900 \u25e6C (e.g. Bjarnason et al.\n1993; Staples et al. 1997; Darbyshire et al. 1998; Menke et al.\n1998). It is difficult to imagine more dissimilar interpretations for\ngeophysical data, and this provides an interesting cautionary tale.\nBoth the thin\u2013hot crust model and the thick\u2013cold crust model have\nbeen widely interpreted as providing evidence for a plume. This\nsuggests that no crustal structure would be considered inconsistent\nwith this hypothesis, and that an Icelandic plume is an a priori as-\nsumption rather than a hypothesis.\nThe key factor in the recent rejection of the thin\u2013hot crust model\nwas further detections of the deep reflector first recognized by Ba\u02dath\n(1960). In addition, \u2018mid-crustal\u2019 reflectors have also been observed,\ne.g. in the lower crust offshore and to the west of the Reykjanes\npeninsula (Weir et al. 2001). It is possible that the mid-crustal re-\nflector would have been interpreted as the Moho had the deeper\nreflector not been observed, and this raises the question regarding\nthe continuity of the deep reflectors interpreted as a Moho beneath\nIceland. These are observed on a piecemeal basis and, where the\nsegments detected are spatially close and at similar depths, it is\nreasonable to propose that they are parts of a continuous structure.\nHowever, where they are widely separated spatially, and at radically\ndifferent depths, such an interpolation is less safe. The deeper part\nof the crust and the crust\u2013mantle transition zone have considerable\nthickness and probably comprise a stack of subhorizontal layers with\nsignificant velocity contrasts, some of which may be reflective sills\nor petrologically contrasting layers in the lower crust. Later reflec-\ntions may be difficult to observe, since they would be masked by\nearlier reflections. Icelandic crust may thus contain more than one\nstrong reflective horizon and the shallowest everywhere may not\ncomprise a single, laterally continuous horizon.\nThe model of Staples et al. (1997), for example, has a Moho\nthat shallows from \u223c35 km beneath eastern Iceland to \u223c19 km\nbeneath the NVZ, with a dip of up to \u223c35\u25e6. 2-D gravity modelling\nof this structure predicts a gravity anomaly of \u223c50 mGal, which\nis not observed, a temperature contrast of \u223c700 \u25e6C, and requires a\nspecial explanation for how such extreme lateral variability could be\nmaintained mechanically. No such thinning is observed beneath the\nWVZ. It seems paradoxical that the crust beneath the NVZ, thought\nto be more productive of melt than the WVZ, should be thinner. A\nmodel in which a deeper reflector is laterally continuous beneath\na shallower reflector under the NVZ, and crustal thickness varies\nonly mildly, might be consistent with the seismic data and more\ngeologically plausible. Such a deeper reflector was detected nearby\nin the RRISP data (Bjarnason et al. 1993). Dramatic local variations\nin crustal thickness are not observed beneath the Greenland\u2013Iceland\nand Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridges.\nThe model whereby the thickest crust beneath central Iceland is\ninterpreted as a location of enhanced melt production associated\nwith a plume (Darbyshire et al. 2000b; Allen et al. 2002) is at odds\nwith seismic-wave attenuation studies of central Iceland (Menke &\nLevin 1994), which show that the lower crust is relatively cold, and\nsubstantially below the solidus of gabbro at 30\u201340 km depths. Since\nIcelandic crust is much thicker than crust at MORs, this implies that\nthe top 40 km is colder over the presumed plume centre beneath\nMORs. The mantle beneath is not likely to be as hot as under nor-\nmal MORs at equivalent depths since the lowermost crust would\nthen be extensively molten. Uppermost mantle velocities estimated\nfrom explosion seismology lie in the range V p = 7.7\u20138.3 km s\u22121,\ncompared with uppermost mantle velocities beneath MORs of V p =\n7.3\u20137.8 km s\u22121 for crust\u2013mantle transition zones. The seismic obser-\nvations thus provide no evidence for anomalously high temperatures\nin the uppermost mantle beneath Iceland either. Menke et al. (1998)\nsuggested that a subsolidus \u2018lid\u2019 overlies an underlying hot mantle\nplume. An alternative interpretation of the observations is that they\nprovide no support for, but evidence against, a hot plume.\nFrom isostatic considerations, Menke (1999) concluded that the\ncrust\u2013mantle density contrast beneath Iceland is 89 \u00b1 12 kg m\u22123.\nSeveral studies have jointly modelled explosion seismology crustal\nstructures and gravity assuming crust\u2013mantle density contrasts of\n\u223c200 kg m\u22123 (Staples et al. 1997; Darbyshire et al. 2000b; Weir\net al. 2001). Local mantle density deficiencies of up to \u223c3 per\ncent have been proposed to account for discrepancies between the\ntwo data sets beneath the rift zones and central Iceland. However,\na gradational crust\u2013mantle transition zone that varies in thickness\nby \u223c5 km beneath Iceland, or a thick zone of crust\u2013mantle mixing,\ncould account for lateral variations in gravity of up to \u223c20 mGal, and\nLVZs in the upper and lower crust could account for an additional\nseveral tens of mGal. It is thus not clear to what extent density\ndeficiencies in the mantle are required.\nIt has been suggested that 3He\/4He culminates in central Iceland\nand that this indicates the centre of a plume (Breddam et al. 2000).\nHowever, a radial geometry of 3He\/4He would not be expected for\nan eastward-migrating plume. Instead, higher 3He\/4He would be\nexpected throughout western and central Iceland than in eastern\nIceland. Such an asymmetric pattern is not observed. Measurements\nof helium isotope ratios in rocks dredged from the Greenland\u2013\nIceland and Iceland\u2013Faeroe ridges would contribute valuable ad-\nditional data to this debate, and to the debate concerning the depth\nof origin of anomalous 3He\/4He values (Foulger & Pearson 2001).\nIt is interesting to speculate to what extent the Iceland vol-\ncanic province resembles other oceanic LIPs. High-quality seis-\nmic data constraining lower-crustal and basal-crustal structure are\navailable from the Ontong\u2013Java Plateau (Furumoto et al. 1970,\n1976; Richardson et al. 2000), the Kerguelen Islands (Recq et al.\n1990), the Madagascar ridge (Sinha & Louden 1981) and Hawaii\n(Watts et al. 1985). In all cases high-velocity basal crustal layers\nare detected up to 30 per cent as thick as the crust (Table 2). This\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, GJI, 155, 567\u2013590\n588 G. R. Foulger, Z. Du and B. R.

It is not clear to what\nextent its location over a spreading plate boundary affects its crustal\nstructure, but formation at ridges has been suggested for oceanic\nLIPs in general (Anderson 1994).\nIt is interesting to note that there are several reports of plume-\nlike upper-mantle low-velocity bodies in places where plumes are\nthought to have once existed but now are long extinct, or where\nplumes are not expected. In addition to being underlain by thick\ncrust with high basal velocities, the mantle beneath the Ontong\u2013Java\nPlateau contains a body with a velocity anomaly as strong as V s =\n\u22125 per cent throughout the depth range \u223c50\u2013300 km (Richardson\net al. 2000). This crust and mantle structure is almost identical to\nthat observed beneath Iceland (Foulger et al. 2000, 2001) and yet\nvolcanism at the Ontong\u2013Java Plateau ceased \u223c90 Ma and there is\nno surface heat-flow anomaly. Mantle low-velocity bodies have been\ndetected beneath the Parana\u00b4 flood basalts, South America (VanDecar\net al. 1995) and northwest India (Kennett & Widiyantoro 1999),\nwhich ceased to be active \u223c80 and \u223c65 Ma, respectively. These\nobservations suggest that a high-temperature interpretation of the\nmantle low-velocity body beneath Iceland is non-unique and that\ncomposition and very low-degree partial melt may be important.\nNotwithstanding the extensive work done in Iceland, a number of\nkey problems still remain unsolved. The thick\u2013cold crust model for\nIceland, which is supported by petrology and marine heat-flow mea-\nsurements (Stein & Stein 2003), seems at odds with the hypothesis\nthat central Iceland is underlain by a hot plume. On the other hand,\nIceland is clearly a site of enhanced melt production, and the most\nnatural model for such productivity in the absence of a large tem-\nperature anomaly is anomalous mantle composition (Foulger 2002).\nThe question remains unanswered, however, by what structures and\nmechanisms melt is transported from its zone of origin in the mantle\nup through tens of kilometres of crust to shallow holding chambers\nor directly to the surface.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank Mike O\u2019Hara, Don Anderson, Warren Hamilton, Jerry\nWinterer, Niels Oskarsson, Olafur Flovenz, Dave Hill, Walter\nMooney, Bob White and Rob Staples for helpful discussions.
