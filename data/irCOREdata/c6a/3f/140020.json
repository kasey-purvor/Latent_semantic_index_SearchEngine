The effect of solute potential and temperature was \nexamined on in vitro mycelia growth and on expression of FUM1 gene, quantified by \nspecies specific real time RT-PCR assays. Although both species showed similar two \ndimensional profiles of growth, for F. verticillioides optimal growth conditions were \nmaintained at higher temperatures and lower solute potential values. FUM1 gene \nexpression was markedly induced at 20\u00baC in both species, under sub-optimal \nconditions for growth; however, their expression patterns differed in relation to solute \npotential. Whereas FUM1 expression was induced in response to increasing water \nstress in F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum showed a stable expression pattern \nregardless of water potential conditions. These results suggest a differential regulation \nof fumonisin biosynthesis in these species that might be related to their different host \nrange and play an ecological role. Additionally, environmental conditions leading to \nwater stress (drought) might result in increased risk of fumonisin contamination of \nmaize caused by F. verticillioides. \n \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \n Fusarium verticillioides (Gibberella moniliformis, G. fujikuroi mating population \nA) and F. proliferatum (G. intermedia, G. fujikuroi mating population D) are important \npathogens of maize. They produce a number of mycotoxins, among which fumonisins \nare considered the most relevant. Both species show differences in host range. \nFumonisin-producing F. verticillioides is basically restricted to maize where it causes \near and stalk rot, whereas F. proliferatum colonises a wide range of hosts in addition to \nmaize, as diverse as pine trees, asparagus or palm trees, and dietary crops such as \nwheat and barley. In these crops, it may cause black point symptoms (Conner et al., \n1996; Desjardins et al., 2007). Both species have a wide distribution in temperate \nregions (Desjardins et al., 2000; De Souza & Formento, 2004; Aliakbari et al., 2007; \nCavaglieri et al., 2009) and they are particularly relevant in Southern Europe (Logrieco \net al., 2002; Soldevilla et al., 2005; Jurado et al., 2006; Medina et al., 2006). \nFumonisins are a family of toxic and carcinogenic mycotoxins which cause \nserious diseases affecting humans and animals (Marasas et al., 2004). Because of the \nhealth risk associated with consumption of contaminated commodities, their occurrence \nis currently under regulation in many countries including the European Union \n(Commision Regulation EC No 1126\/2007). \n Fusarium growth and fumonisin production result from the complex interaction \nof several factors (biotic and\/or abiotic). Water stress and temperature are the most \nrelevant environmental factors which influence fungal growth and mycotoxin production \nand therefore, they are essential to understand the overall process and to predict and \nprevent plant diseases and mycotoxin production (Charmley et al., 1994). Recently, \nseveral reports point out the impact of diverse stress conditions on mycotoxin \nproduction, including osmotic stress, pH and diverse compounds such as fungicides \n(Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2007; Jurado et al., 2008; Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2008,). These \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n4 \n \nstudies have used real time RT-PCR and microarrays-based approaches, since \nregulation of mycotoxin biosynthesis has been demonstrated to occur primarily at a \ntranscriptional level in many cases (Proctor et al., 1999; O\u2019Callaghan et al., 2006). \nFurthermore, high and significant correlation has been observed between the relative \namount of FUM1 transcripts quantified by real time RT-PCR and the fumonisin content \nin both F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum (L\u00f3pez-Errasqu\u00edn et al., 2007; Jurado et al., \n2010), as well as for TRI5 gene and desoxinivalenol (DON) in F. graminearum (Doohan \net al., 1999).This method permits rapid and accurate quantification  of the effect of \nfactors and treatments on mycotoxin biosynthesis, reducing incubation times necessary \nto accumulate the toxin that might be eventually produced at analytically  detectable \nlevels. Although stress factors may be only transient, in a situation of changing climatic \nconditions, they may become more permanent in certain regions (Miraglia et al., 2009) \nand, therefore, information about the behaviour of the different fungal species \nregarding growth patterns and toxin production in environmental stress conditions \nmight become critical to improve prediction and control of the mycotoxin risk. \n The objectives of this study were (i) to compare the effects of temperature and \nnon-ionic osmotic potential stress on growth and FUM1 gene expression in F. \nverticillioides and F. proliferatum strains and (ii) examine the temporal kinetics of the \neffect of ionic solute potential on growth and FUM1 gene expression in F. proliferatum. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nFungal isolate. \nF. verticillioides FvA (FvMM7-3) strain and F. proliferatum strain FpA (FpMM1-\n2) were originally isolated from a maize field in Madrid (Spain), in September 2003, and \nboth were reported to produce fumonisins (Jurado et al., 2008; Jurado et al., 2010). \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n5 \n \nFungal cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar medium (Scharlau Chemie, \nBarcelona, Spain) at 4\u00baC and stored as spore suspensions in 15% glycerol at -80\u00baC in \nthe Department of Genetics of the University Complutense of Madrid. \n \nGrowth in relation to osmotic potential (ionic and non-ionic potential) \nThe medium used in this study was a fumonisin-inducing solid agar medium \npreviously reported (L\u00f3pez-Errasquin et al., 2007), which contained malt extract (0.5 \ng\/L), yeast extract (1 g\/L), peptone (1 g\/L), KH2PO4 (1 g\/L), MgSO4-7H2O (0.3 g\/L), \nKCl (0.3 g\/L), ZnSO4- 7H2O (0.05 g\/L), CuSO4-5H2O (0.01 g\/L), fructose (20 g\/L) and \nbacteriological agar (15 g\/L). \nThe solute potential ( s) was modified either with the non-ionic solute glycerol \nto analyze the effect of water stress and temperature on growth rate and FUM1 gene \nexpression of both strains, or with the ionic solute sodium chloride (NaCl) to perform a \nkinetics study with F. proliferatum FpA. In the first case, the solute potentials used were \n-0.7, -2.8, and -7.0 MPa of s, corresponding to water activities (aw) of 0.995, 0.982 \nand 0.955 respectively, while in the kinetics study the solute potentials were -0.7, -2.8, -\n7.0, and -9.8 MPa of s = aw of 0.995, 0.982, 0.955 and 0.937 respectively. These \nsolutes were not added to the control medium (-0.7 MPa = aw of 0.995). All the \ntreatments and replicate agar media were overlayed with sterile cellophane sheets \n(P400; Cannings, Ltd., Bristol, United Kingdom) before inoculation to facilitate removal \nof the fungal biomass for RNA extractions. \n \nInoculation, incubation and growth assessment \nA 3-mm-diameter agar disk from the margin of a 7-day-old growing colony of F. \nverticillioides FvA and F. proliferatum FpA grown at 25\u00baC was used to centrally \ninoculate plates for each replicate and treatment. The plates were incubated at 15, 20, \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n6 \n \n25, 30 and 35 \u00baC for 10 days in the fumonisin-inducing medium modified with glycerol. \nThe experiment consisted of a fully replicated set of treatments with at least three \nreplicates per treatment. Experiments were repeated once. \nAssessment of growth was made daily during the 10-day incubation period. Two \ndiameters of the growing colonies were measured at right angles to each other until the \ncolony reached the edge of the plate. The radii of the colonies were plotted against \ntime, and a linear regression was applied to obtain the growth rate as the slope of the \nline. \nAn additional time course experiment was carried out in the fumonisin-inducing \nmedium modified with NaCl. This study was carried out at 25\u00baC for 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. \nThree independent replicates were destructively sampled at each time point and \nanalyzed. \n \nRNA isolation and cDNA synthesis \n The biomass was removed from the cellophane at the end of the incubation \nperiod, and the total RNA was extracted using the \u201cTotal Quick RNA cells and tissues\u201d \nkit (Talent, Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and stored at -80\u00b0C. \nDNase I treatment was used to remove genomic DNA contamination from the samples \nusing \u201cDNase I, amplification grade\u201d (Invitrogen; United Kingdom), following the \nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cGeneAmp \nGold RNA PCR reagent kit\u201d (Applied Biosystems). Each 20-\u00b5l reaction mixture \ncontained 500 ng of total RNA, 0.5 \u00b5l of oligo(dT)16 (50 \u00b5M), 10 \u00b5l of 5X RT-PCR \nbuffer, 2 \u00b5l of MgCl2 (25 mM), 2 \u00b5l of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) (10 mM), \n2 \u00b5l of dithiothreitol (100 mM), 0.5 \u00b5l (10 U) of RNase inhibitor (20 U\/\u00b5l), 0.3 \u00b5l (15 U) of \nMultiScribe reverse transcriptase (50 U\/\u00b5l), and sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate- treated \nwater up to the final volume. Synthesis of cDNA was performed in a Mastercycler \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n7 \n \ngradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf; Germany) according to the following procedure: \nafter a hybridization step of 10 min at 25\u00b0C, RT was carried out for 12 min at 42\u00b0C. The \ncDNA samples were kept at -20\u00b0C. Samples incubated in the absence of reverse \ntranscriptase were used as controls.  \n \nReal time RT-PCR and quantitative analysis of the data \n Real time RT-PCR assays were used to quantify FUM1 and TUB2 expression in \nboth species. The primer pair PQF5-F (5\u2019 GAGCCGAGTCAGCAAGGATT 3\u2019) and \nPQF5-R (5\u2019 AGGGTTCGTGAGCCAAGGA 3\u2019) was used for F. verticillioides (L\u00f3pez-\nErrasquin et al., 2007). Primer pair FUM1P2-F (5\u2019 CCCCCATCATCCCGAGTAT 3\u2019) and \nFUM1P2-R (5\u2019 TGGGTCCGATAGTGATTTGTCA 3\u2019) was used   for F. proliferatum \n(Jurado et al., 2010). These two species specific primer sets were used to amplify the \nFUM1 gene. The pair of primers  PQTUB-F2 (5\u2019 ACATCCAGACAGCCCTTTGTG 3\u2019) \nand PQTUB-R2 (5\u2019 AGTTTCCGATGAAGGTCGAAGA 5\u2019) was used to amplify a partial \nregion of TUB2 gene in both species (Jurado et al., 2010). Real time RT-PCR reactions \nwere performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied \nBiosystems). The PCR thermal cycling conditions for both genes were as follows: an \ninitial step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. \nSYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) was used as the reaction mixture, \nwith the addition of 2.6 \u00b5l of sterile Milli-Q water, 1.2 \u00b5l of each primer (5 \u00b5M), and 5 \u00b5l \nof template cDNA, in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l. In all experiments, appropriate negative \ncontrols containing no template were subjected to the same procedure to exclude or \ndetect any possible contamination or carry over. Each sample was amplified twice in \neach  experiment.  \nThe results were normalized using the TUB2 cDNA amplifications run on the \nsame plate. The TUB2 gene is an endogenous control that was used to normalize \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n8 \n \nquantification of mRNA target for differences in the amount of total cDNA added to \neach reaction. In real time RT-PCR analysis, quantification is based on the threshold \ncycle (CT), which is defined as the first amplification cycle at which the fluorescence \nsignal is greater than the minimal detection level, indicating that PCR products become \ndetectable. Relative quantitation is the analytic method of choice for this study \n(Ginzinger, 2002). In this method, a comparison within a sample is made with the gene \nof interest (FUM1) to that of the endogenous control gene (TUB2). Quantitation is \nrelative to the control gene by subtracting the CT of the control gene from the CT of the \ngene of interest (CT). In graphic representations (see Figures 2 and 3), we have used \nthe average CT mean value of the three replicates performed in each experiment, and \nthis was subtracted by the calibrator mean value of the three replicates to obtain the \ncorresponding CT values. CT values were transformed to log2 (due to the doubling \nfunction of PCR) to generate the relative expression levels.  \n \nStatistical analysis of results \nThe linear regression of increase in radius against time (days) was used to \nobtained growth rates (mm day-1) as indicated above for each set of treatments. \nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) was made for the growth rate, FUM1 gene expression \nand temporal studies including the data of the three replicates from each experiment. \nAll sets of results were evaluated by using StatsGraphics Centurion XV.II (Statistical \nGraphics Corp., Herndon, VA). FUM1 gene expression data were transformed prior to \nanalysis by y = log10 (FUM1 gene expression). \n \nRESULTS \n \nEffects of temperature and non-ionic solute stress on growth \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n9 \n \nFigure 1 shows the two dimensional profiles of relative growth rates of F. \nverticillioides FvA (Figure1a) and F. proliferatum FpA (Figure1b) strains on fumonisin-\ninducing solid agar medium in response to changes in non-ionic solute potential and \ntemperatures between 15 and 35\u00baC. \nFigure 1a shows that the optimal conditions for growth (5-6 mm day-1) of F. \nverticillioides were at between 25 and < 35\u00baC, at both -0.7 and -2.8 MPa s. However, \ns \u2264-7.0 MPa, at all the temperatures, severely reduced growth (1-3 mm day\n-1). \nTemperatures below 17\u00baC and above 35\u00baC could be considered marginal for  growth. \nThe ANOVA analyses showed that single factors (temperature and water potential) and \ntheir interaction were statistically significant (Table 1a). Therefore the most restrictive \nconditions might be lower and higher temperature and increased solute stress. \nDifferences in growth were significant at all the temperatures, as well as osmotic s \nexcept at -0.7 and -2.8 MPa of s where no significant difference in growth was \nobserved (data not shown). \nOptimal conditions for growth (5-6 mm day-1) of F. proliferatum were slightly \nnarrower than for F. verticillioides (Figure 1b), at between 25 and 30\u00baC and at both -0.7 \nand -2.8 MPa s. Growth was reduced (1-3 mm day\n-1) at -7.0 MPa s or lower at  all  \ntemperatures. The ANOVA showed statistically significant effects for all the single and \ninteracting factors (Table 1b). Differences in growth were significant at all the \ntemperatures and osmotic potentials (data not shown). \n \nEffects of temperature and non-ionic solute stress on FUM1 gene expression \nFigure 2 shows the relative FUM1 gene expression of the F. verticillioides FvA \nand F. proliferatum FpA strains cultured on fumonisin-inducing agar medium for 10 \ndays in response to both temperature and s potential. \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n10 \n \nFUM1 gene expression profiles by F. verticillioides are shown in Figure 2a. The \nhighest fold induction, in all the three s potentials, was at 20 \u00baC, and at both -2.8 and -\n7.0 MPa was statistically different. At -0.7 MPa, FUM1 gene expression showed \ninduction only at 20\u00baC. Increasing water stress resulted in higher induction of FUM1 \ngene in all the temperatures tested. The ANOVA showed statistically significant effects \nfor both single factors (temperature and solute potential) and their interaction for F. \nverticillioides (Table 2a). \nInduction of FUM1 gene in F. proliferatum seemed to be predominantly \ninfluenced by temperature, and largely restricted to 20\u00baC (Figure 2b). The reduction of \nFUM1 gene expression observed at higher temperatures decreases with increasing \nwater stress, suggesting that this condition might have a certain positive effect on gene \nexpression. The ANOVA showed that single factors, temperature and water potential, \nhas a statistically significant effect on FUM1 gene expression (Table 2a).  \nThe standard error of the mean values of the two amplifications performed for \neach sample in the same plate, were generally very low (about 0.1%) and never higher \nthan 1%, indicating a  high level of reproducibility of the real time RT-PCR assay. \n \nEffects of the ionic solute potential on temporal FUM1 gene expression \n Figure 3 shows the effect of the ionic s potential on growth rates, expressed as \narea of fungal growth, and induction of FUM1 gene expression by F. proliferatum at \n25\u00baC after 3, 6, 9 and 12 days. The results indicated that FUM1 mRNA synthesis was \nremained stable at all the s conditions tested. Figure 3 also shows the results \nobtained for F. verticillioides in a previous study carried out in similar conditions for \ncomparison purposes (Jurado et al., 2008). \n \nDISCUSSION \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n11 \n \nIn this work we have compared the growth rate and relative induction of FUM1 \ngene expression profiles of two Spanish isolates of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum \nin response to temperature and s potential, the main factors affecting fungal grow and \nmycotoxin production (Charmley et al., 1994, Magan, 1997). The detailed two \ndimensional growth maps obtained for both species showed quite similar patterns. Both \nspecies had similar optimal growth rates (5-6 mm\/day) and they were able to growth \nover a wide range of conditions, particularly at high temperatures and water potentials. \nThis confirms earlier studies (Marin et al., 1999; Marin et al., 2004; Hope et al., 2005) \nand they are basically in agreement with epidemiologic studies showing the association \nof these two species with changes in water stress and high temperatures, close to 30-\n35\u00baC. However, F. verticillioides showed a significantly better performance at higher \ntemperatures and water stress than F. proliferatum. This might contribute to its \ncomparatively higher incidence in maize fields from regions affected by increasing \ntemperatures and severe drought (Soldevilla et al., 2005; Jurado et al., 2006). \nThe analysis of FUM1 expression in F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum isolates \nperformed in this study revealed an effect of temperature and water potential at a  \ntranscriptional level, similar to other studies reported for for diverse toxigenic fungal \nspecies (Feng & Leonhard, 1998; O\u2019Callaghan et al., 2006; Jurado et al., 2008; \nSchmidt-Heydt et al., 2008). The relative highest FUM1 induction was observed at \n20\u00baC for both species, close to but not coincident with their optimal temperature for  \ngrowth (25\u00baC), excluding the s potential factor, suggesting a preference for certain \ntemperatures for maximum FUM1 gene expression. Interestingly, a similar situation \nwas reported for other mycotoxigenic species (Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2008), although \nthere is no conclusive explanation for this so far. However, the response of both \nspecies to water stress was markedly different. In the case of F. verticillioides, \nincreasing s potential values resulted in an induction of FUM1 expression, particularly \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n12 \n \nat the highest water stress conditions tested, confirming the pattern observed \npreviously (Jurado et al., 2008). In the case of F. proliferatum, a similar trend could be \ndetected although at a much lower intensity. Similarly, induction of toxin biosynthetic \ngene expression was reported for the trichothecene-producing F. culmorum, the \naflatoxin-producing A. parasiticus and the OTA-producing Penicillium verrucosum \n(Schmidt-Heydt et al., 2008) in response to s potential stress, as well as to pH and \ntemperature, suggesting that environmental stress and toxin biosynthesis by fungi are \ncausally related and it might be a more general phenomenon (Magan, 2007). \nFurthermore, it has been suggested that stress-activated protein kinases might play a \nrole in the regulation of mycotoxins (Kohut et al., 2009). \nBased on the work of Jurado et al. (2008), the contribution of s potential stress \non induction of fumonisin biosynthesis in F. verticillioides showed a clear stimulation \nunder water stress conditions of the FUM1 gene in the temporal study. However, the \nresults obtained for F. proliferatum showed a stable pattern of FUM1 expression in \nrelation to water stress. These results suggest that the relative contribution of these two \nspecies to fumonisin production on maize might differ during the course of colonization. \nFumonisin production would be expected to be higher, in the case of F. proliferatum, at \nearlier stages (when temperature is still mild), whereas the relative contribution to \nfumonisin synthesis by F. verticillioides would increase at later stages, when water \nstress progressively increases. \nThe actual biological role of mycotoxins is far from being elucidated, although in \ncertain cases their role in pathogenesis  has been demonstrated. This seems to be the \ncase of DON-producing F. graminearum strains in wheat (Desjardins et al., 1996). The \nrole of fumonisins in maize pathogenesis is more controversial. A recent report, \nhowever, suggests that fumonisin production by F. verticillioides is necessary for \ndevelopment of disease symptoms in maize (Glenn et al., 2008). The diverse mycoflora \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n13 \n \npresent on plants and substrates during colonization suggests a situation where \ncomplex interactions among species competing for nutrients and space exist. In this \nscenario, strategies involving the development of differential nutrient abilities (Wilson & \nLindow, 1994) and\/or production of secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) might confer \nadvantages to occupy or retain a certain niche. In this context, mycotoxins could be \nregarded as competitive factors (chemical antagonists). Although conclusive evidence \nsupporting this view is still lacking, experiments on competition between F. \nverticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. graminearum, A. flavus and A. parasiticus, all  \nassociated with maize, suggest a role of toxins, and fumonisins in particular, in their \ninteractions (see the excellent review by Marin et al., 2004). Some reports also \ndescribea prevalence of F. verticillioides with respect to F. graminearum or A. flavus, \nparticularly in certain environmental conditions, and an effect of their interaction on \ntoxin production (Zimo & Scott, 1992; Velluti et al., 2000). However, accurate \nquantification of toxin (fumonisin) content variation at the concentrations which might \nbe of biological significance in the course of the interactions is technically difficult to \nachieve. The use of the sensitive and specific real time RT-PCR protocols may be an \nalternative approach to evaluate the role of mycotoxins in this ecological context. The \nimportance of these conditions (temperature and water potential) was also \ndemonstrated in a recent study on their effect on carbon nutritional patterns and niche \noverlap between A. flavus and F. verticillioides (Giorni et al., 2009). This study showed \nthat these two species assimilate different carbon sources resulting in them occupying \ndifferent niches in maize under specific ranges of environmental conditions, and that \nonly under extreme conditions was dominance of one over the other species. \nNutritional dominance of F. verticillioides occurred at 20\u00baC, mainly at 0.955 aw (= -7.0 \nMPa water potential). These conditions parallel the highest induction of FUM1 gene, \nparticularly in F. verticillioides. The pattern of FUM1 induction by this species in \nFEMS Microbiology Ecology (2010), Volume 73, Issue 2, 303-310. \n \n14 \n \nresponse to water stress, close to its limit for growth, and which are conducive for \nAspergilli, could be envisaged as advantageous for F. verticillioides to retain its niche \noccupation and preventing dominance by A. flavus. A change in regulation of fumonisin \nbiosynthesis might have improved adaptation of F. verticillioides to maize, at the \nexpenses of reducing the host range. F. proliferatum, in contrast, showed a less \nspecific regulation pattern with a relatively stable and constant FUM1 gene expression \nin relation to growth rate, more compatible with a less specific colonization pattern, in \nagreement with the broad range of host plants which this species is able to colonize. \n \nAcknowledgements: This work was supported by the Spanish MCYT (AGL-2007-\n66416-C05-02), and UCM-GR58\/08-A (910672).
