Introduction\nThe term stochastic resonance (SR) is used to describe a group of phenomena in which the\nfluctuations of a nonlinear system enhance its response to a regular (e.g. periodic) force.\nThe response at first increases with increasing noise intensity and then decreases again,\nand the same is often true of the signal-to-noise ratio as well. Over the last decade SR\nhas attracted considerable attention from the scientific community, and about a hundred\npapers on the issue have been published. The subject has been discussed at many meetings,\nincluding a topical international conference whose proceedings [1] describe the state of the\nart as at mid-1992. Since that time, several interesting new results have emerged, or have\nbeen reported in greater detail, including the observation of synchronization of switchings\nbetween the stable states of a Brownian particle in a bistable optical trap [2], prediction\nand observation of SR in an underdamped noise-driven monostable system [3], observation\nof SR in a bistable SQUID loop [4] and in a crayfish mechanoreceptor [5], observation of SR\nin systems with coexisting periodic attractors [6, 7], theory of SR for a quantum two-level\nsystem with ohmic dissipation in the context of conduction fluctuations in a mesoscopic wire\n[8] and observation of the periodic modulation of the conductance in response to modulation\nof the temperature or electric field [9], theory and observation of SR for a monostable system\nwith a cyclic variable [10], SR in a tunnel diode [11], and noise-enhanced heterodyning in\nbistable systems [12], a phenomenon closely related to SR.\nStochastic resonance was first discovered [13]-[15] in searching for an explanation of the\nearth\u2019s ice-age cycle (see Section 2A, below), and then for a few years the analysis was\nconcentrated on SR in simple symmetric bistable systems. More recently the context of SR\nwithin the larger scientific enterprise has become clear. It is the main aim of this paper to\nexplain how SR relates to standard statistical physics, to point out that the phenomenon\nbecomes analytically tractable when treated through the traditional methods, in particular\nlinear response theory, and to emphasize the close relationship of SR to earlier results in\ncondensed matter physics. The paper is not intended to be a review in the conventional\nsense, and neither have we attempted to cite every paper published on SR. Rather, we wish\nto propose a perspective in which SR can be seen to take its place with other phenomena in\nphysics.\nSection 2 sets the scene by reviewing major events in the relatively recent history of the\nsubject, i.e. since the term stochastic resonance was introduced. In Section 3, we go back in\ntime to consider the prehistory of SR, showing how linear response theory (LRT) provides\nthe simplest and most natural way of approaching the phenomenon under most conditions,\nand discussing some precursors of SR in condensed matter physics. There are a number\nof interesting SR phenomena that lie outside the range of linear response so that LRT is\ninapplicable, however. They can nonetheless still be treated through application of standard\nmethods of statistical physics: some examples are considered in Section 4. Finally, in Section\n5, we draw conclusions and look to the future of SR.\n2. An Historical Overview\nFor historical reasons, the term \u201cstochastic resonance\u201d is used for the two distinct sorts of\neffects that arise in fluctuating systems driven by a periodic force A cos \u2126t: (i) fluctuation-\nmediated periodic modulation of the populations of the coexisting stable states, in bistable\nsystems [13]-[15], and (ii) the increase, with increasing fluctuation intensity, of the periodic\nsignal in the system [13], and of the signal-to-noise ratio R [16, 17] - a phenomenon by no\n2\nmeans limited to bistable systems [3, 10]. We briefly review the origins of the idea of SR\nin Sec. 2A, and then in Sec. 2B we describe the discovery of SR in a ring laser and how\nit resulted in an explosion of interest leading to the observation of SR in different types of\nsystems.\nA. Ice-ages Prelude\nThe term \u201cstochastic resonance\u201d was introduced by Benzi et al. [13] in the context of\nthe theory of ice ages. By the mid-seventies it had been established that the data on the\noxygen isotopic composition (relative amount of the 18O-isotope) of planktonic foraminifera,\nand some other independent geological data revealing climatic changes (the ice ages), display\nperiodicity, with a period of \u223c 100,000 years [18]. This period is close to that of the variations\nof the eccentricity of the earth\u2019s orbit. As a result of the latter the power of solar radiation\nincident on Earth (averaged over a period long compared to a year) varies correspondingly,\nand it was hypothesized that this might be responsible for the global climatic changes [19].\nA simple model that describes such effects is one in which the climate is described by a\nsingle variable, which might be thought of as a global earth temperature Te, the equation\nfor Te being the energy balance equation (cf. Refs. [14, 15])\nCe\ndTe\ndt\n= \u00b5P [1\u2212 \u03b1(Te)]\u2212 \u03c3\u02dcT 4e . (1)\nHere, P is the average power of the incoming solar radiation, Ce is the thermal capacity of\nthe Earth, \u03b1(T ) is the average albedo, and \u03c3\u02dc is the average renormalized Stefan constant\nthat describes cooling of the Earth via infrared emission. The parameter \u00b5 characterizes the\neccentricity of the Earth\u2019s orbit: it depends on time periodically with the period 2pi\/\u2126 = 105\nyears,\n~\n'\n \n,\n.\n.\n.\n \n1\n~\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n_\n~\n-\n-\n-\n~\n-\n-\ni \n:.\nIt:\n. \nI \nFigure 1: The double-well potential U(q). The minima q1, q2 correspond to the stable states\nof a system with the dynamical variable q. In the model of climate (1) q is the effective\ntemperature of the Earth Te, and U(Te) = \u03a6(Te).\n3\n\u00b5 \u2261 \u00b5(t) = 1 + A cos \u2126t (2)\nEq.(1) can be rewritten in the form of an equation of motion of an overdamped particle\nwith the coordinate Te in a potential \u03a6(Te):\ndTe\ndt\n= \u2212 \u2202\u03a6\n\u2202Te\n, \u03a6(Te) =\n\u222b Te\ndT \u2032eC\n\u22121\ne\n(\n\u2212\u00b5P [1\u2212 \u03b1 (T \u2032e)] + \u03c3\u02dcT \u20324e\n)\n. (1a)\nThe stable states of the system correspond to the minima of \u03a6(Te) (cf. Fig.1). The model (1)\ncan be relevant to the problem of the ice ages provided there are two stable states coexisting\nfor \u00b5 = 1: one with the temperature Te = Te2 for which the Northern Hemisphere is mostly\nfree from ice, and the other with the temperature Te = Te1 for which a substantial part of the\nNorthern Hemisphere is covered by ice. In these two states the reflectivity of the Earth, i.e.,\nthe value of the parameter \u03b1 in (1), is different, and therefore they are both self-consistent\n(when Te = Te2 > Te1 there is no ice, less energy is reflected, and thus the temperature is\nhigher, whereas for Te = Te1 < Te2 the ice is in position, hence more energy is reflected, and\nthe temperature is lower; we notice that the difference Te2 \u2212 Te1 \u223c 10K).\nIn the model (1), switching between the states occurs provided the amplitude A of the\nmodulation of the parameter \u00b5 is large enough, so that for |\u00b5\u2212 1| \u2264 A the system has only\none stable state. In other words, when \u00b5 as given by (2) varies periodically in time, the\npotential \u03a6 changes so that each of the two wells disappears in turn, and the system is then\nforced to switch to the other one. However, estimates show that the modulation amplitude\nA related to the oscillations of the eccentricity of the Earth\u2019s orbit is not large enough to\nprovide such a deterministic switching.\nIt was suggested by C. Nicolis and by Benzi et al. [14, 15] that the periodic modulation of\nthe populations of the wells can be mediated by fluctuations. These fluctuations, which have\nrelatively short correlation times, result from atmospheric and oceanic circulation, volcanic\neruptions (dust in the atmosphere can change the albedo noticeably, and for quite a long\ntime), etc. In the simplest model they can be assumed to be a white noise driving the global\ntemperature, in which case Eqs.(1), (1a) take the form\nq\u02d9 = \u2212\u2202U\n\u2202q\n+ \u03be(t), \u3008\u03be(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2D\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032) (3)\nwith\nq \u2261 Te, U(q) = \u03a6(q),\nwhere D is the characteristic noise intensity. It is assumed to be small so that the fluctuations\nof q (i.e., of Te) about the stable values q1,2 \u2261 Te1,2 (U \u2032(q1,2) = 0, U \u2032\u2032(q1,2) > 0, cf. Fig.1) are\nsmall compared to q2\u2212q1. Nevertheless, although the noise is weak on the average, there can\noccur, occasionally, outbursts large enough to cause switchings between the stable states.\nThe probability Wnm of a switching from the nth to the mth state for a white-noise driven\nsystem was found by Kramers [20] to be of the activation type,\nWnm = pi\n\u22121 [U \u2032\u2032(qn)|U \u2032\u2032(qs)|]1\/2 exp(\u2212\u2206Un\/D), \u2206Un = U(qs)\u2212 U(qn) (4)\nHere, \u2206Un is the depth of the nth well of the potential U(q) measured relative to the\nvalue U(qs) of U(q) at its local maximum qs between the minima of U(q) at q1 and q2\n(U \u2032(qs) = 0, U \u2032\u2032(qs) < 0, see Fig.1).\n4\nIf for \u00b5 = 1 the depths \u2206U1 and \u2206U2 are nearly equal, as they are assumed to be in the\nmodel of the climate (1), the populations of the stable states vary at random in time, and\ntheir average values w1, w2 are of the same order of magnitude:\nw1\/w2 = W21\/W12 \u221d exp [(\u2206U1 \u2212\u2206U2) \/D] (5)\nLet us assume now that the potential is slowly modulated in time so that \u2206U1 and \u2206U2\noscillate in counterphase, and for a half of the period 2pi\/\u2126 one of the potential wells is\nrelatively deeper, while for the other half of the period it is shallower. Then the average\nvalues of the populations w1,2 will oscillate in time as well, i.e., there will occur periodic\nmodulation of the populations for a modulation strength that is much less than that needed\nto change the potential from a double-well to a single-well. So, a periodic redistribution of\nthe system over the stable states in response to a periodic forcing comes about via noise.\nIt was this interesting idea that was suggested in [14, 15] as a plausible explanation of the\nperiodicity of the ice ages.\nWe notice that, in the very first paper where the term \u201cstochastic resonance\u201d was intro-\nduced, [13] an interesting question was raised: is it possible for the noise-mediated modula-\ntion of the populations to be so strong that the instantaneous values of the populations, and\nnot just their ensemble-averaged values, depend on time periodically? If so, what are the\nnecessary conditions? Obviously, such a periodicity would arise in the absence of noise for\nsufficiently strong driving but, at first glance, for a weak periodic driving in the presence of\nnoise the transitions between the states occur at random, although with a tendency towards\nperiodicity. It turns out, however, that even for a weak driving, provided that the driving\namplitude exceeds the properly scaled noise intensity and that the modulation frequency is\nsmall enough, the redistribution over the states is nearly periodic in time: see Sec. 4A.\nB. SR in a Ring Laser\nThe observation of SR in a bidirectional ring laser, reported by McNamara, Wiesenfeld, and\nRoy [17], played an important role in attracting the attention of the scientific community\nto SR. A bidirectional ring laser is bistable: it can generate modes that propagate either\nclockwise or anticlockwise. With the aid of a modulator (an intracavity acousto-optical\nmodulator) it was possible to switch the operation between the modes. The modulator was\ndriven by a broad-band (quasi-white) noise and by a sinusoidal voltage, and the intensity\nof the radiation of the laser in one direction was detected. In the absence of the periodic\nmodulation this intensity was fluctuating in time at random. When the sinusoidal voltage\nwas applied in addition to the noise there occurred a \u03b4-shaped spike in the power spectrum of\nthe intensity at the frequency \u2126 of the voltage (there were also spikes at the overtones). Not\nonly was the intensity of this spike found to increase with increasing intensity of the input\nnoise, but, quite counter-intuitively, the ratio R of the former to the height of the power\nspectrum at the frequency \u2126 in the absence of the periodic driving (the signal-to-noise ratio)\nwas found to increase, too, as shown in Fig.2. Similar behaviour had already been observed\nby Fauve and Heslot [16] in analog simulations using a Schmitt trigger as the bistable system.\nThe theory of SR considered in [17] and also in the paper by McNamara and Wiesenfeld\n[21] was based on the balance equation for the average populations of the coexisting stable\nstates of a noise-driven bistable system:\nw\u02d91(t) = W21(t)w2(t)\u2212W12(t)w1(t), w1(t) + w2(t) = 1 (6)\n5\nen 24 \n-0 \n-\n0 22 \n~ \na: 20 \nw \n(\/) \n0 \nz \n~ \n_J \n<l: \nz \n0 \n(\/) \n1 \n16 \n1 \n12 \n1~-------~~..__..--~_._~_._~ \no n 20 2D 40 50 60 7o \nlf\\PUT NOISE DENSITY (mV\/-v'Hz} \nr\u00b7 . d ... - .. ~\" ......... \nL ___ _ \nFigure 2: Signal-to-noise ratio vs noise intensity as observed for a ring laser in [17].\nThe transition probabilities Wnm(t) were evaluated in the adiabatic approximation: i.e. it\nwas assumed that the frequency \u2126 of the sinusoidal driving was small compared to the\nreciprocal relaxation time of the system. In this case the probability Wnm(t) is determined\nby the instantaneous value of the potential well depth \u2206U\u02dcn(A cos \u2126t) where \u2206U\u02dcn(A) is the\ndepth of the nth potential well in the potential tilted by the external force, U(q)\u2212 Aq. For\nsmall enough amplitude of the force only linear terms need be retained in the potential well\ndepth. Using Eq.(4), one can then write Wnm(t) in the form [22]:\nWnm(t) = W\n(0)\nnm exp(gn cos \u2126t), gn = g\u02dcnA\/D, g\u02dcn = \u2212\n[\n\u2202\u2206U\u02dcn(A)\n\u2202A\n]\nA=0\n(7)\nwhere W (0)nm is the value of the transition probability in the absence of the force.\nIt is evident from Eq.(7) that the parameter which determines the effect of the driving\nis proportional to the ratio of the amplitude of the force A to the noise intensity D. Thus,\nin agreement with what was said above, for small D we can have strong effects even for\ncomparatively small A. Moreover, if A is so small that |g1,2| \u001c 1, the probabilities Wnm(t)\ncan be expanded in gn and Eq.(6) can then be solved analytically. To first order in |g1,2| the\ndependence of the populations w1,2(t) on time is sinusoidal.\nThe solution is particularly simple in the important case of a symmetric potential U(q),\nfor which \u2206U1 = \u2206U2, g1 = \u2212g2. An important byproduct of this solution is an interesting\nbehaviour of the spectral density of fluctuations Q(\u03c9) of the coordinate of the system q(t):\nQ(\u03c9) = lim\n\u03c4\u2192\u221e (4pi\u03c4)\n\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b \u03c4\u2212\u03c4 dt q(t) exp(i\u03c9t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 (8)\nIf the coordinate q(t) is approximated by the sum of its values in the stable states q1,2\n6\nweighted by the populations w1,2(t) (the two-state approximation), then, because of the\nsinusoidal dependence of the populations on time a \u03b4-shaped spike occurs in Q(\u03c9) at the\nfrequency \u03c9 = \u2126. The ratio of its intensity (area) to the value of the power spectrum Q(0)(\u2126)\nin the absence of the driving, i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio R, is given by the expression\n[17, 21]:\nR =\npi\n4\ng2W (0), g \u2261 g1 = \u2212g2, W (0) \u2261 W (0)12 +W (0)21 = 2W (0)12 (9)\nIt follows from (7) and (9) that the signal-to-noise ratio increases exponentially with\nincreasing noise intensity for small enough D,\nR \u221d exp(\u2212\u2206U\/D), \u2206U \u2261 \u2206U1 = \u2206U2 (\u2206U \u001d D)\ni.e. SR occurs. As mentioned above, it is this amazing result that has stimulated so much\ninterest in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance among physicists, biologists, and engi-\nneers. In addition to ring lasers, optically trapped Brownian particles, and SQUIDs referred\nto above, SR has been observed in various analog electronic circuits (see Refs. [16, 6, 7],\n[23]-[25]), in a passive optically bistable system [26] and in a bistable laser with saturable\nabsorber [27], in a magnetoelastic ribbon [28], in a hybrid device that included an ESR\ncavity [29], in single-domain uniaxially anisotropic magnetic particles [30], and in a magne-\ntoresistive oscillator [31]. It has also been proposed [32, 33] that SR may be relevant to the\ntransmission of information by sensory neurons. SR has been shown to occur in models of\nexcitable neurons [34], and the effects on SR of neuron coupling in a neural network have\nbeen analyzed [35].\n3. Linear Response Theory and the Prehistory of SR\nA. Linear response Theory\nA simple theoretical approach to SR that makes it possible to place the phenomenon in\ncontext within statistical physics and condensed matter physics, and to relate it to what\nhad been done in these areas before, is based on linear response theory (LRT). According\nto LRT, if a system with a coordinate q is driven by a weak force A cos \u2126t (the addition to\nthe Hamiltonian function of the system is of the form of \u2212Aq cos \u2126t), there arises a small\nperiodic term in the ensemble-averaged value of the coordinate, \u03b4\u3008q(t)\u3009, oscillating at the\nsame frequency \u2126 and with amplitude a proportional to that of the force [36]:\n\u03b4\u3008q(t)\u3009 = a cos(\u2126t+ \u03c6) \u2261 Re\n[\n\u03c7(\u2126)Ae\u2212i\u2126t\n]\n, A \u2192 0 (10)\na = A|\u03c7(\u2126)|, \u03c6 = \u2212 arctan [Im\u03c7(\u2126)\/Re\u03c7(\u2126)]\nThe quantity \u03c7(\u2126) here is the susceptibility of the system. Eq.(10) holds for dissipative\nand fluctuating systems that do not display persistent periodic oscillations in the absence\nof the force A cos \u2126t and where the correlations of fluctuations decay in time. In the more\ngeneral case of a system performing phase-locked oscillations with a period 2pi\/\u03c9F (this case\nis of particular interest for systems driven by strong periodic fields with a frequency \u03c9F , e.g.,\nby laser radiation) the linear response is described by the expression\n7\n\u03b4\u3008q(t)\u3009 = Re\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\u03c7(k)(\u2126)A exp[i(k\u03c9F \u2212 \u2126)t], A \u2192 0 (11)\nIn this case a weak force gives rise to vibrations not only at its own frequency, but also at\nthe combination frequencies |\u2126\u00b1 k\u03c9F |, and \u03c7k(\u2126) are the corresponding susceptibilities.\nThe function \u03c7(\u2126) (or the functions \u03c7(k)(\u2126)) contains all information on the response of\nthe system to a weak driving force. It gives both the amplitude of the signal, a, and its phase\nlag with respect to the force, \u03c6 (or partial amplitudes and phase lags for the vibrations at\nthe combination frequencies). In fact, Eqs.(10), (11) still hold even if the force is of a more\ngeneral nature than just an \u201cadditive\u201d coordinate-independent force described by the extra\nterm \u2212Aq cos \u2126t in the Hamiltonian. In particular, the force can be coordinate-dependent\n(a multiplicative force), or it can be the intensity of the noise driving the system (e.g., the\ntemperature, if the noise is of thermal origin) that is modulated periodically. In any case,\nif the amplitude of the modulation is weak enough, the response of the system is linear\nand is described by (10), (11). The onset of SR in response to a modulation of the noise\nintensity (temperature) [37] has been investigated in [8] and [9]. Note that LRT is equally\napplicable to \u201cnon-traditional\u201d SR-displaying systems such as integrate-and-fire neurons [38]\nand threshold detectors [39].\nThe periodic terms (10),(11) induced by the force give rise to \u03b4-shaped spikes in the\nspectral density of fluctuations (SDF) Q(\u03c9) (8) at the frequency of the force \u2126 (and at the\ncombination frequencies |\u2126\u00b1 k\u03c9F |). The intensity (i.e., the area) of these spikes is equal to\none fourth of the squared amplitude of the corresponding vibrations, i.e., to 1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2, or\nto 1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(k)(\u2126)|2. The signal-to-noise ratio R is thus expressed in terms of the susceptibility\nas\nR =\n1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(\u2126)|2\/Q(0)(\u2126) (A\u2192 0), (12)\nand for periodically oscillating systems the signal-to-noise ratio R(k) at the combination\nfrequency |\u2126\u2212 k\u03c9F |\nR(k) =\n1\n4\nA2|\u03c7(k)(\u2126)|2\/Q(0)(|\u2126\u2212 k\u03c9F |) (A\u2192 0) (13)\nTherefore, the evolution of the susceptibility and of Q(0)(\u03c9) with varying noise intensity D\nshow immediately whether or not SR (understood as an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio\nwith increasing D in a certain range of D) is to be expected at a given frequency.\nDescribing SR in terms of the susceptibility is particularly advantageous for systems that\nare in thermal equilibrium or in quasi-equilibrium. In this case the susceptibility can be\nexpressed immediately in terms of the SDF Q(0)(\u2126) in the absence of periodic driving via\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relations [36]:\nIm\u03c7(\u03c9) =\npi\u03c9\nT\nQ(0)(\u03c9), Re\u03c7(\u03c9) =\n2\nT\nP\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03c91Q\n(0)(\u03c91)\n\u03c921\n\u03c921 \u2212 \u03c92\n(14)\nwhere P implies the Cauchy principal value and T is the temperature in energy units. It\nfollows from (12), (14) that the onset of SR can be predicted from purely experimental data\non the evolution of the SDF of a system with temperature without assuming anything at all\nabout the equations that describe its dynamics, i.e. for a system treated as a \u201cblack box\u201d.\n8\nThe relevance of this approach to SR has been demonstrated unambiguously in analog\nexperiments on electronic systems simulating Brownian motion in a bistable [24] and in\na monostable [3] potential. In [24] the signal-to-noise ratio for quasithermal fluctuations\nof a particle with inertia and friction fluctuating in a symmetric double-well potential was\n(i) measured directly, with a weak periodic force applied to a system, and (ii) calculated\nfrom experimental measurements of the power spectrum in the absence of periodic forcing,\nusing Eqs.(12),(14). The dependence of R on the noise intensity exhibited the reversed-\nN shape typical of SR in continuous systems (cf. Figs.5, 7 below), and the results of\nthese two independent experiments were in a perfect qualitative and satisfactory quantitative\nagreement with each other. The data obtained in [3] show that, contrary to what had been\ncommonly accepted, a noise-induced increase of the signal in a system does not require that\nit be a bistable one: the effect can arise in monostable systems as well. The particular\nmechanism explored [3] is based on the fact that the frequency of vibrations in a nonlinear\nsystem depend on their amplitude (energy). By varying the temperature of the system (the\nnoise intensity) one varies the distribution of the system over the energy, and hence over the\nfrequency. It is possible therefore to \u201ctune\u201d the system, and thus to increase the response\nat an appropriate frequency. The strong and rather interesting temperature dependence of\nthe spectral density of the fluctuations Q(0)(\u03c9) of underdamped systems was reviewed in\nRef. [40]. Recent results obtained for a special class of underdamped systems where the\ndependence of the eigenfrequency of the vibrations on the amplitude is nonmonotonic \u2013 the\nupper curve in Fig. 3(b) refers to a system of this sort \u2013 are reported in [41]; it is in this\ncase that the noise-induced increase of the signal-to-noise ratio, not of the signal only, was\nobserved in an underdamped system [3].\nB. Precursors of Stochastic Resonance in Condensed Matter Physics\nTo the best of our knowledge, analytical results for the susceptibility of a fluctuating sym-\nmetrical system with two coexisting stable states, which traditionally has been of primary\ninterest in the context of SR, were first obtained by Debye [43]. Debye analyzed the dielectric\nresponse of polar molecules in a solid (in ice \u2013 a material that is somehow magic for SR!). He\nassumed that a molecule can switch between two equivalent positions within a unit cell, and\nthat in these positions the dipole moment of the molecule is pointing in opposite directions.\nThe expression for the transition probability Wnm he used was equivalent to Eq.(7), with\ngn = \u2212E dn\/T where E is the amplitude of the electric field and dn is the dipole moment\nin the nth position (n = 1, 2; d1 = \u2212d2); he linearized Wnm in E dn\/T (however, he did not\nspecify the form of the transition probabilities W (0)nm in the absence of the external field).\nThe well-known expression for the susceptibility Debye derived was, in the present nota-\ntion, of the form\n\u03c7D(\u2126) =\nd21\nT\nW (0)\nW (0) \u2212 i\u2126 , W\n(0) \u2261 W (0)12 +W (0)21 = 2W (0)12 . (15)\nThis expression made it possible to explain the experimental data on the dispersion of the\nreal part of the dielectric constant of ice. It is straightforward to see from the fluctuation-\ndissipation relations (14) that the signal-to-noise ratio R that follows from (12),(15) is pre-\ncisely of the form (9) (cf. [24, 42]).\nIn the context of condensed-matter physics, the quantity of special interest is often the\nphase shift between the force and the signal, since it is the phase shift that determines\nthe absorption of the energy from the force, in particular from the electromagnetic field in\n9\n100 \nTemperature \u00b0C \n1.0 I 60 30 10 0 -10 I I I I I i '. ?\"h ;>' i:;eE\"', I J \u2022 \n'\\ \nfrequency I I I I\\ Cl \\ \\ I \\ ,,-...... \n\"'O c.p.s.

In the symmetrical two-state model with thermally activated\ntransitions between the states the phase shift \u03c6 as given by (10),(15) decreases monotonically\nwith increasing temperature [43, 14, 21]:\n(\u03c6)two\u2212state = \u2212arctan(\u2126\/W (0)) (16)\nThe phase shift is one of the characteristics used to describe the elastic properties of solids:\nin this case the force is stress, the signal is strain, and the phase lag is referred to as internal\nfriction [44]. For finite frequency of the stress there arises a phase shift between the stress\nand the strain, even though the stress is linear in the strain (and thus reversible). In some\nmetal alloys internal friction displays a strong nonmonotonic temperature dependence as\nshown in Fig.3 taken from [45]. A simple mechanism of this dependence for body-centered\ncubic metals with interstitial impurity atoms was suggested by Snoek [46]. He assumed\nthat an impurity occupies one of the equivalent interstitial positions in an elementary cell\nthus forming an elastic dipole. The dipole can reorient as a result of thermal fluctuations.\nUniaxial stress breaks the symmetry, like an electric field in the case of electric dipoles, and\nthe response to the stress is given basically by Debye\u2019s theory, slightly modified to allow for\na different number of equivalent stable states.\nThe strain measured experimentally arises as a combination of the strain related to the\nreorientation of the elastic dipoles and the strain due to the deformation of those cells\nthat are free of impurities. This deformation is characterized by much faster relaxation\nthan the reciprocal reorientation rate 1\/W (0) of the dipoles at room temperature. For low\ntemperatures the reorientation rate W (0) is negligibly small, and the strain is equal to that\nfor a crystal with immovable defects and is in phase with the stress (Hooke\u2019s law). Therefore\nthe phase shift is equal to zero rather than to \u2212pi\/2 as given by (16). Only for higher T\ndoes the reorientation of the elastic dipoles become \u201cswitched on\u201d and the term described\n10\n-\n-e-1 \nD\n \n0 \n'\/,,.......,\u00a7 _\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_\n ~ \n'I 1\u2022 !

The\nsolid line represents the theoretical prediction based on LRT [47] (nonlinear corrections do\nnot change this curve strongly for the actual value of A). The inset shows the normalized\nsignal-to-noise ratio in the region of the minimum in R.\nby (16) contributes to the phase shift. As a result |\u03c6| sharply increases with temperature\nand displays a clearly resolved peak. The position of the peak (see the next subsection) may\nbe used to determine the activation energy for reorientation of the elastic dipoles [44].\nC. Stochastic resonance in continuous dynamical systems\nIn many cases, the bistable dynamical systems where SR is investigated are continuous rather\nthan being two-state ones. For such systems, the dependence of the phase lag on the noise\nintensity (temperature) is similar to that observed for internal friction in anelastic solids.\nThis is clearly seen from a comparison of Fig.3 and Fig.4. In the latter case, the data [47]\nare from an analog simulation of overdamped Brownian motion (3) in a simple symmetric\nbistable potential\nU(q) = \u22121\n2\nq2 +\n1\n4\nq4. (17)\nThe explicit expressions for the phase shift and for the signal-to-noise ratio R of a continuous\nsystem (3) for low noise intensities and for low frequency \u2126 are of the form:\n\u03c6 = \u2212arctan[(\u2126\/\u2126r)(\u21262rW (0) + \u21262D)\/(\u2126rW (0)2 + \u21262D)]\n11\nR =\npiA2\n4D2\n(\u21262rW\n(0)2 + \u21262D2)\/(\u21262rW\n(0) + \u21262D), \u2126, D \u001c \u2126r, W (0) \u001c D (18)\nwhere \u2126r \u2261 t\u22121rel = U \u2032\u2032(q1,2) is the reciprocal relaxation time for the intrawell motion (correc-\ntions to (18) of the order of \u2126\/\u2126r, W\n(0)\/\u2126r, D\/\u2206U have been dropped). It is straightforward\nto see that the maximum of |\u03c6| as given by (18) occurs at the noise intensity Dmax given by\nthe equation\nW (0)(Dmax) = \u2126(Dmax\/\u2126r)\n1\/2\nThe value of Dmax therefore depends on the frequency of the signal \u2126, as observed in anelastic\nsolids (cf. Fig.3; the model (3), (17), although similar, is not entirely identical to the one\nused in the theory of anelastic relaxation, and therefore the peak in Fig. 4 for the dynamical\nsystem is much broader the corresponding peak in Fig.3).\nThe response of a continuous system differs markedly from that of a two-state one, not\nonly in its non-monotonic rather than monotonic variation of \u03c6 with D, but also in the\nvariation of its signal\/noise ratio with D: for small D the function R decreases rather than\nincreases with increasingD [21, 24] (see insert in Fig.4, and also Fig.5 where similar behaviour\nis demonstrated in a different system). Such behaviour has a simple explanation [24]. For\nsmall D the interwell transitions are frozen out: the susceptibility is then determined by the\nintrawell motion of the system, and is independent of noise, whereas the power spectrum is\nformed by the fluctuations about the minima of the potential and increases proportional to\nthe noise intensity, so that R \u221d 1\/D, as seen from (18) for small W (0). The analysis of the\nposition of the local maximum of R vs noise intensity was performed by Fox and Lu [48].\nlO\n \nC\\2 \u2022 \n0 \nEJ \n0 \n0 \nEJ \nC\\2 \n0 \nc::-, \n\u2022\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n_\n_\n, \n0 \n.\n \n' \n0 \n,\n-\nt.J \no\n. \n-\n.\n \n-\nQ \n-\n.\n \n0 \n-\nLn \n~\n.\n \nO\n\u00b7 \n,_\n_\n \n.\n \n.\n.\n.\n-1 \n-\n-\n\u2022\n \n0 a\u00b7 \n-\n.\n \n-\n0 \n~\n \n,_\n_\n' \n-\n.\n \n0\n0\n \n-\n::I \n~ \n,... \n' \n0 \n-\n~\n \n~\n \n~\n~\n \n0 \n0 \n'\"\n' \n0 \n,., \n' \nTI \n~\n \n0 \n\u2022\n \n0 lO \n0 \u2022\n \n0 \n0 \n0 \u2022\n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nco \n~\n \nC\\2 \nFig. 5 \nI\n~\n \n-\nI \nFigure 5: The response of a noise-driven underdamped nonlinear oscillator with coexisting\nperiodic attractors to an extra force A cos \u2126t (after [7]). The equation of motion of the\noscillator for A = 0 is of the form q\u00a8 + 2\u0393q\u02d9 + \u03c920q + q\n3 = F cos\u03c9F t. The quantities P and\nP represent signal-to-noise ratios at the frequencies \u2126 and 2\u03c9F \u2212 \u2126. The data refer to the\nkinetic phase transition range, (\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)\/\u0393 = 0.236, 3F 2\/32\u03c93F (\u03c9F \u2212 \u03c90)3 = 0.0814.\n12\nIn general, of course, the motion of a bistable continuous system will not be described by\nthe simple model (3) of overdamped Brownian motion in a symmetrical double-well potential.\nNeither will the noise be white, nor will the system be moving in a static potential. For\nexample, the stable states of interest may be the states of stable periodic vibrations in a\nstrong external force (periodic attractors), as is of interest in the context of optical bistability\n[49]. Analytic results for the fluctuations and for the response to a weak external force can\nbe obtained [50] provided the noise intensity is small so that the probabilities, per unit time,\nof fluctuational transitions between the states are very much smaller than the reciprocal\nintrawell relaxation time, W (0)nm \u001c t\u22121rel , and the fluctuations occur mostly within narrow\nvicinities of the stable states. The results hold for systems driven by an arbitrary Gaussian\nnoise, where, apart from special cases, the dependence of the transition probabilities on the\ncharacteristic noise intensity D is of the activation type, and in the absence of the additional\nweak force\nW (0)nm = const\u00d7 exp(\u2212Rn\/D). (19)\nThe activation energy of the escape from the state n, Rn, is given by the solution of a\nvariational problem [51]. For certain types of non-white Gaussian noise Rn was found in\nRefs. [51, 52].\nFor small enough D in the case of period-one attractors there are two main contributions\nto the susceptibilities \u03c7(k)(\u2126) as defined by Eq.(11) [50]. One comes from the motion close\nto the stable states where the system spends most of the time. This contribution is given\nby the sum of the partial susceptibilities \u03c7(k)n (\u2126) (n = 1, 2) weighted by the populations of\nthe stable states wn. The other contribution, \u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126), is important in the case where the\nfrequency \u2126 of the weak force is small or is close to the frequency \u03c9F of the strong external\nforce. In this case the weak force modulates the probabilities of the transitions between the\nstates and thus the populations of the states (see below):\n\u03c7(k)(\u2126) =\n\u2211\nn=1,2\nwn \u03c7\n(k)\nn (\u2126) + \u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126), w1 = 1\u2212 w2 = W (0)21 \/W (0)12 (20)\nThe partial susceptibilities \u03c7(k)n (\u2126) can be easily found from the equations of motion\nlinearized about the stable states in the absence of noise (noise determines the values of the\npopulations wn via the transition probabilities). They display dispersion on the frequency\nscale t\u22121rel , and in the range of interest for SR, \u2126 \u001c t\u22121rel or |\u2126 \u2212 \u03c9F | \u001c t\u22121rel they are nearly\nfrequency-independent.\nThe characteristic frequency scale which determines the dispersion of \u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126) is given by\nthe relaxation rate of the populations, i.e., by W (0) = W\n(0)\n21 +W\n(0)\n12 . A simple way to obtain\n\u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126) for \u2126\u001c \u03bdc or |\u2126\u2212\u03c9F | \u001c \u03bdc (\u03bdc = min(t\u22121rel , t\u22121cor) , where tcor is the correlation time of\nthe noise) is based [50] on the fact that the major effect of the additional weak force A cos \u2126t\non the populations of the states comes from the modulation of the activation energies of\nthe transitions between the states Rn. For small \u2126 one can find this modulation just by\nevaluating Rn for a system biased by a constant force A, i.e., by finding Rn \u2261 R\u02dcn(A), and\nthen by replacing A by A cos \u2126t. In this case the escape probability can be written in the\nform similar to (7):\n13\nWnm(t) = W\n(0)\nnm exp(gn cos \u2126t), gn = g\u02dcnA\/D, g\u02dcn = \u2212\n[\n\u2202R\u02dcn(A)\n\u2202A\n]\nA=0\n(\u2126\u001c \u03bdc). (21)\nIn the case of periodic attractors corresponding to forced vibrations in a strong periodic\nforce F cos(\u03c9F t + \u03c6F ) the additional weak force A cos \u2126t with \u2126 very close to \u03c9F can be\nconsidered as a modulation of the amplitude of the strong force,\nF cos(\u03c9F t+ \u03c6F ) + A cos \u2126t = Re F\u02dc (t) exp (i (\u03c9F t+ \u03c6F ))\nF\u02dc (t) = F + A exp[i(\u2126\u2212 \u03c9F )t\u2212 i\u03c6F ]\nThe activation energies Rn \u2261 Rn(F ) are independent of the phase \u03c6F , and when the weak\nforce A cos \u2126t is applied they take on time-dependent values corresponding to the instanta-\nneous value of the amplitude |F\u02dc (t)|, so that\nWnm(t) = W\n(0)\nnm exp [gn cos ((\u2126\u2212 \u03c9F ) t\u2212 \u03c6F )] , gn = g\u02dcnA\/D, (22)\ng\u02dcn = \u2212\u2202Rn(F )\n\u2202F\n(|\u2126\u2212 \u03c9F | \u001c \u03bdc, \u03c9F )\nEqs. (21), (22) can be inserted into Eq.(6) for the populations. For small amplitudes\nA, when |gn| \u001c 1, one can expand the transition probabilities in gn. Terms linear in gn are\nsinusoidal in time, and so also are the corresponding terms in the populations w1,2(t). If we\nwrite the expression for the coordinate in the nth period-one attractor as\nqn(t) =\n\u2211\nk\nq(k)n exp(ik\u03c9F t)\nthen the expression for the susceptibility \u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126) for |\u2126\u2212 \u03c9F | \u001c \u03bdc is of the form (cf. [50])\n\u03c7\n(k)\ntr (\u2126) = \u2212\nW\n(0)\n12 W\n(0)\n21\nW (0)\ng\u02dc1 \u2212 g\u02dc2\nD\nq\n(k\u22121)\n1 \u2212 q(k\u22121)2\nW (0) \u2212 i(\u2126\u2212 \u03c9F )e\ni\u03c6F . (23)\nThe equation for the susceptibility with respect to a low-frequency force, \u2126\u001c \u03bdc, is very\nsimilar:\n\u03c7tr(\u2126) = \u2212W\n(0)\n12 W\n(0)\n21\nW (0)\ng\u02dc1 \u2212 g\u02dc2\nD\nq\n(0)\n1 \u2212 q(0)2\nW (0) \u2212 i\u2126 (\u2126\u001c \u03bdc). (23a)\nIt can easily be seen that in the symmetrical case, W\n(0)\n12 = W\n(0)\n21 , g\u02dc1 = \u2212g\u02dc2, q(0)1 = \u2212q(0)2 , this\nexpression goes over into Debye\u2019s result (15).\nNote that, for a simple model of overdamped Brownian motion in the bistable potential\n(3), the expressions for the susceptibility (20), (23a) (and also the explicit form of the partial\nsusceptibility \u03c7n(\u2126)) can be obtained at low noise intensities directly from an analysis of\nthe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions [53] of the Fokker-Planck equation, both in the case of a\nsymmetric [54](a) and an asymmetric [54](b) potential. Alternatively, one can evaluate the\npower spectrum in the absence of periodic driving Q(0)(\u03c9) and use the fluctuation-dissipation\n14\nrelations (14). The function Q(0)(\u03c9) was found by Ha\u00a8nggi and Thomas [55]. However, they\nfailed to get the correct expression for the term \u03c7tr in the susceptibility which is responsible\nfor the onset of SR. A detailed numerical analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation for the\nsystem (3), (17) is [56] in full agreement with the analytic results given above, and in\nparticular with those for the phase shift shown in Fig. 4. Note also some earlier numerical\nwork on the Fokker-Planck equation for periodically driven bistable systems [57].\nFrom (21) \u2013 (23) (cf. [50]) it is clear : (i) that the susceptibility due to the transitions\nbetween the states increases, for finite frequency, exponentially sharply with noise intensity\nD in the range of very small D; (ii) that this susceptibility is greatest within a frequency\nrange that is extremely narrow compared with the characteristic inverse relaxation time t\u22121rel ;\n(iii) that the susceptibility is proportional to the reciprocal noise intensity, which is why it\ncan become large, and (iv) that it becomes large only within the narrow range of the system\nparameters for which R1 \u2248 R2, and thus the transition probabilities, W (0)12 and W (0)21 , and the\npopulations, w1 and w2, are of the same order of magnitude (the range of the kinetic phase\ntransition). All of these features have been observed in experiments, and are immediately\nrelated to the onset of SR in bistable systems. In particular, the feature (iv) shows that\nSR in bistable systems is a kinetic phase transition effect. Some results demonstrating SR\nin a system with periodic attractors, obtained from an analog electronic experiment [7], are\nshown in Fig.5. The experimental data (points) exhibit an increase of signal-to-noise ratio\nboth at the frequency of the force \u2126 and at the combination frequency 2\u03c9F \u2212 \u2126. The onset\nof a strong signal at the latter frequency is a demonstration of a new phenomenon that arises\nthrough the noise-induced interattractor transitions and may be called, using the terms of\nnonlinear optics, a \u201cgiant noise-mediated four-wave mixing\u201d. The results are clearly seen to\nbe in a good agreement with the LRT theoretical predictions (curves).\nAn interesting situation arises if a system displays period-doubling when driven by a\nstrong enough periodic field. If, in addition, the system is driven by a stationary noise, the\nstationary populations of the two co-existing period-two attractors are the same: the only\ndifference between the attractors is that they are shifted in time by the period of the force\n2pi\/\u03c9F and, because of the symmetry with respect to translation in time by 2pi\/\u03c9F , there is\nno reason for one of them to be occupied for more of the time than the other. Such a system\nis therefore a perfect candidate for observing SR and, indeed, SR in an analog electronic\ncircuit that displayed period doubling has been observed recently [6]. Strictly speaking,\nwhen the system is driven by a weak force A cos \u2126t in addition to the strong force F cos\u03c9F t,\npersistent vibrations at the frequencies |\u2126\u00b1 1\n2\n\u03c9F | do not arise because of the occurrence of\ntransitions between the period two attractors. However, since the lifetime of the attractors\n(equal to the reciprocal transition probabilities) is large, narrow peaks are to be expected in\nthe power spectrum of the system at |\u2126\u00b1 1\n2\n(2k + 1)\u03c9F |, with a width \u223c W12. The increase\nof the intensity of the peak at |\u2126\u2212 1\n2\n\u03c9F | with increasing noise intensity as observed in [6] is\nshown in Fig.6.\nOur outline of the history of stochastic resonance would be incomplete if we forbore to\nmention that, in spite of being so well known in other areas of physics, linear response theory\nfor the first few years after it was applied to SR [24] faced strong arguments and encountered\nserious problems with gaining recognition in this context. The inapplicability of LRT would\nimply either that statistical physics as a whole is fatally flawed, or that it does not apply to\nthe systems that display SR. In fact, the two statements are equivalent, because, generally\nspeaking, there is nothing special about the dynamics of the continuous fluctuating bistable\n15\n20 \n\u2022\u2022 I \nFig. 6 \n, ...

We find it unsurprising therefore that the results for SR derived\nfrom LRT are in good agreement with the experiments.\nWe would point out also that a corollary of LRT is that, for small-amplitude signals, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio at the output of a system driven by a stationary Gaussian noise does\nnot exceed that at the input, even if the system displays SR. Indeed, the Fourier components\nof the noise are statistically independent and the total power of the noise \u039e(\u2126)d\u2126 in a small\nspectral interval d\u2126 about the frequency of the signal \u2126 is small. The signal-to-noise ratio\nat the input is given by 1\n4\nA2\/\u039e(\u2126), whereas that at the output is 1\n4\n|\u03c7(\u2126)|2A2\/[|\u03c7(\u2126)|2\u039e(\u2126)+\nQ\u2032(0)(\u2126)]. The quantity Q\u2032(0)(\u2126) gives the value of the spectral density of fluctuations in the\nsystem at frequency \u2126 as it would be if there was no signal and the spectral components\nof the noise at frequency \u2126 were suppressed, i.e., the power spectrum of the input noise\nhad a hole at frequency \u2126. By construction Q\u2032(0)(\u2126) \u2265 0, which proves the statement (In\nlinear systems, on the other hand, which do not mix frequencies, Q\u2032(0)(\u2126) = 0 and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio at the output must be the same as at the input).\nAnother corollary concerns the problem of the response to an incoherent signal fsig(t), i.e.\nto a signal which itself is a narrow-band noise, which was addressed recently in [58]. Again,\nif this noise is stationary and Gaussian, so that different Fourier-components are statistically\nindependent,\nfsig(t) =\n\u222b\nd\u03c9f\u02dcsig(\u03c9) exp(\u2212i\u03c9t), \u3008f\u02dcsig(\u03c9)f\u02dcsig(\u03c9\u2032)\u3009 = \u03a6sig(\u03c9)\u03b4(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u2032)\nthe response to this signal in the presence of an independent external noise is described by\nLRT, and for small \u03a6sig(\u03c9) the addition to the power spectrum of the system\n\u03b4Q(\u03c9) = |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2\u03a6sig(\u03c9)\n16\nThis term may increase with the intensity of the \u201cindependent\u201d noise provided |\u03c7(\u03c9)|2 in-\ncreases in the appropriate frequency range.\n4. Nonlinear Effects in Stochastic Resonance\nAlthough, as shown above, the LRT approach to SR is immensely fruitful and enables\nthe phenomenon to be described, qualitatively and quantitatively, under a wide range of\nconditions for small values of A, there are other parameter ranges lying beyond the regime\nof linear response which are also of interest. In one of these, the low-noise limit, analytic\nresults can still be obtained even when A is not particularly small. It is discussed in Section\n4A. A second example of an interesting nonlinear regime for which analytic results can be\nderived, the SR-related phenomenon of noise enhanced heterodying, is discussed in Section\n4B.\nA. Nonlinearity in the low-frequency response of a bistable system\nIn the publication where the term \u201cstochastic resonance\u201d was originally introduced [13] it\nwas pointed out that the response of a bistable system to external driving can display strong\nnonlinearity. Indeed, according to (7), (21), (22) the probability Wnm(t) of escape from a\nmetastable state n can change strongly when the amplitude A of the driving force, properly\nweighted, exceeds the noise intensity, i.e., when |gn| \u001d 1. For small noise intensities this\ncan occur even when the force is \u201cdynamically small\u201d so that it does not change the number\nor character of the steady states and nor does it move them significantly in the space of\ndynamical variables [22, 24, 59]. The nonlinearity is at its strongest for frequencies \u2126 very\nmuch smaller than the reciprocal relaxation time of the system t\u22121rel , or for \u2126 very close to\nthe frequency of the strong field \u03c9F in cases where one is present; in what follows we limit\nourselves to systems that are not subject to such a strong periodic field, and only the case\nof small \u2126 will be considered.\nThe mechanism of the nonlinearity for |g1,2| \u001d 1 is easily understood because the tran-\nsition probabilities then vary by orders of magnitude within a period 2pi\/\u2126, according to\n(7). This variation may result in a strong modulation of the populations of the stable states\nw1,2(t), particularly when the probabilities W12(t), W21(t), depend on time in counterphase,\ng1g2 < 0 (as in (7)). Indeed, for |g1,2| \u001d 1 the transitions from a given stable state n are\nmost likely to occur within a short part of the period 2pi\/\u2126 when Wnm(t) is close to its\nmaximum. At this time Wmn(t) is close to its minimum, for g1g2 < 0. One half-period away\nfrom this time, Wmn(t) will in turn be close to its maximum, and it is then that transitions\nto the nth state will be most likely to occur.\nThe population of the nth state is at its maximal value, wn>, just before gn cos \u2126t has\nreached its maximum, and then, after a short time interval where the system is most likely\nto switch, wn(t) drops to its minimal value, wn<. The evolution of wn(t) within this time\ninterval \u03b4t0 is described by the expression [22, 24]\nwn(t) \u2248 wn> exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b t\nt0\u2212\u03b4t0\ndt\u2032Wnm(t\u2032)\n)\n, |gn| \u001d 1, g1g2 < 0, |t\u2212 t0| \u001c pi\/\u2126 (24)\nt0 = 2pik\/\u2126 for gn > 0, t0 = pi(2k + 1)\/\u2126 for gn < 0\n17\n0 .\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n- ' \n.\n.\n.\n ...

The dotted line describes the theory based on (25), (27).\nThe integral (24) can be evaluated by the steepest descent method, yielding\nwn(t) \u2248 wn> exp (\u2212\u03bbn[1 + erf t\u00afn(t)]) , \u03bbn = W (0)nm exp(|gn|)\n(\n2|gn|\u21262\/pi\n)\u22121\/2\n(25)\nwhere t\u00afn(t) = (t \u2212 t0)\/\u03c4n. The quantity \u03c4n \u2261 \u2126\u22121(2\/|gn|)1\/2 gives the characteristic time\ninterval over which wn(t) varies from its maximum value wn> to its minimum value wn< =\nwn> exp(\u22122\u03bbn). We are assuming that pi\u2126\u22121 \u001d \u03b4t0 \u001d \u03c4n in which case the integral (24) is\nindependent of the value of \u03b4t0.\nThe parameter \u03bbn in (25) characterizes [24, 59] the nonlinearity of the response. It gives\nthe probability of the transition from the state n over the time \u03c4n where the transition\nprobability is at its maximal because of the periodic driving.\nThe values of wn>, wn< can easily be obtained from (25) by noticing that wn> + wm< =\n1, n,m = 1, 2 (n 6= m). On a time scale coarse-grained over \u03c41,2 the dependence of the\npopulations w1,2(t) on time takes the form of a square wave, with the jumps between the\nsmaller and larger values occurring every half period of the force. The amplitude of the\njumps\n\u2206w \u2261 1\n2\n(w1> \u2212 w1<) \u2261 1\n2\n(w2> \u2212 w2<) = sinh\u03bb1 sinh\u03bb2\nsinh(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2)\n. (26)\nThis amplitude is large when both parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are of the order of, or exceed,\nunity. Obviously, this may occur at small noise intensities provided the frequency \u2126 is small\nenough. On the other hand, if \u03bb1, \u03bb2 > 1.5 the value of \u2206w exceeds 0.45, i.e., it is close to\nthe limiting value 0.5. This means, in particular, that for such \u03bb1,2 the switchings between\nthe states occur nearly every half-period of the force, i.e., the instantaneous values of the\n18\npopulations of the states depend on time nearly periodically. The interesting effect of the\nperiodicity of switchings between the states was nicely demonstrated by Zhou et al. [59]\nthrough measurements of the distribution of escape times in a periodically driven system\n(3), (17).\nThe above arguments provide an answer to the question formulated in [13] about the\npossibility of a \u201cquasideterministic\u201d periodic switchings, promoted by noise, in response to\na weak periodic driving and establish the range of the parameters where such switchings\noccur.\nStrong modulation of the populations gives rise to a strong modulation of the coordinate\nof the system. For a dynamically weak force the intrawell response is still described by linear\nresponse theory, and the ensemble-average value of the coordinate\n\u3008q(t)\u3009 = \u2211\nn=1,2\nwn(t)\n(\nqn + ARe\u03c7n(\u2126)e\n\u2212i\u2126t) (27)\nwhere qn are the equilibrium positions in the states n = 1, 2 and \u03c7n(\u2126) are the intrawell\nsusceptibilities. The coordinate \u3008q(t)\u3009 of a fluctuating bistable system driven by a relatively\nweak sinusoidal force A cos \u2126t as obtained from (27) (dotted curve) is compared to the result\nof a digital simulation (full curve) in Fig.7 taken from Ref. [22]. It is obvious from Fig.7 that\nthe time dependence of the coordinate is close to a square wave, as expected. A convenient\nnumerical algorithm for investigating the redistribution of the system over the stable states\ninduced by a comparatively weak force valid for arbitrary |g1,2| was considered in [22].\nB. Noise-enhanced heterodyning\nIn heterodyning, two high-frequency fields, one of them a signal and the other a reference\nfield, are mixed nonlinearly to generate a signal at their difference frequency. The frequency-\nselective response and the increase of the signal-to-noise ratio with increasing noise intensity\nin bistable systems make it interesting to apply the idea of stochastic resonance to hetero-\ndyning so as to obtain a new form of the phenomenon, noise-enhanced heterodyning (NEH),\nwhich will be also highly frequency selective. In other words, the idea behind NEH [12] is to\nmix the signal and the reference field via a \u201cdynamical\u201d nonlinearity of a bistable system,\nand then to single out the signal at the difference frequency and to enhance its signal-to-noise\nratio via fluctuational transitions between coexisting stable states.\nWe shall illustrate the effect of NEH on a simple model of an overdamped fluctuating\nbistable system (3) driven by high-frequency forces that stand for the reference and input\nsignals. In the presence of such forces the equation of motion (3) is modified to\nq\u02d9 = \u2212U \u2032(q) + Aref q cos\u03c90t+ Ain cos[(\u2126 + \u03c90)t+ \u03c6in] + \u03be(t) (28)\nHere, the term \u221d Aref is the reference signal of a given frequency \u03c90 (the corresponding force\nbeing applied multiplicatively), and that \u221d Ain is the high-frequency input signal (applied\nadditively). In the general case the amplitude Ain and the phase \u03c6in depend on time, but to\ncharacterize heterodyning one can assume them to be time-independent and investigate the\nheterodyne signal in the system at the difference frequency \u2126, with \u2126\u001c \u03c90.\nSimple analytical results can be obtained provided that the frequency \u03c90 is high compared\nto the reciprocal relaxation time of the system, \u03c90 \u001d t\u22121rel . In this case the motion of the\nsystem consists of fast oscillations at frequency \u03c90 (and its overtones) superimposed on a\nslow motion.

The dashed and dotted lines are theory. The potential simulated is the sym-\nmetrical double-well potential (17). The data refer to the reference frequency \u03c90 = 1.885.\nThe heterodyne frequency \u2126 = 0.008.\nof the coordinate q(sm)(t) can be obtained by the standard methods of nonlinear mechanics\n[60], which yield\nq\u02d9(sm) = \u2212U \u2032(q(sm)) + A cos(\u2126t+ \u03c6\u00afin) + \u03be\u00af(t), A = Aref\n2\u03c90\nAin, \u03c6\u00afin = \u03c6in \u2212 1\n2\npi. (29)\nWe shall assume that the noise \u03be\u00af(t) in (29) is Gaussian, with correlation time tcor \u001c\n\u2126\u22121,\n[\nW (0)nm\n]\u22121\nwhere W (0)nm is the probability of the fluctuational transition n\u2192 m for Ain =\n0. In fact, the noise \u03be\u00af(t) contains both the low-frequency and the rectified high-frequency\ncomponents of the noise \u03be(t) in (28) (the latter components are shifted in frequency by \u03c90\nand multiplied by Aref\/2\u03c90; in practice there is often high-frequency noise superimposed on\nthe input signal, so that these components are important.\nEq. (29) is of precisely the same form as the equation of overdamped periodically driven\nmotion in a double-well potential considered above. Therefore all the arguments of Secs.1,2\napply, and the signal-to-noise ratio for the signal in the system at the frequency \u2126 \u001c\nt\u22121rel should increase with the increasing noise intensity in a certain range of the latter. In\nparticular, if the noise \u03be\u00af(t) is white with intensity D, the dependence of the signal-to-noise\nratio on D for small enough amplitudes A in the case of a symmetric double-well potential\nU(q) should be given by Eq.(18).\nThe above arguments have been tested by means of analog electronic experiments [12].\nIn Fig.8 measurements of the signal-to-noise ratio in heterodyning are presented for the two\n20\ntypes of noise \u03be(t): a broad-band (white) noise and a noise with a comparatively broad\nband centered at the frequency \u03c90. In both cases a strong enhancement of the heterodyne\nsignal and, of the signal-to-noise ratio, induced by the noise is clearly seen, and is in good\nagreement with the theory.\n5. Conclusions\nIt follows from the results discussed above that stochastic resonance may be understood and\ndescribed in terms that are traditional for statistical physics, including linear response theory\nin particular, and that SR has its well-known counterparts in condensed-matter physics. In\nfact, of course, the possibility of increasing the response of a system to an external forcing by\nincreasing the intensity of its fluctuations (temperature) is well known from daily experience:\ne.g., materials are often heated up prior to processing; light absorption in semiconductors and\ndielectrics increases with increasing temperature, in certain frequency ranges, and there are\nmany other examples of the same kind. However, when thought in terms of signal processing,\nand particularly when one considers the noise-induced enhancement not only of a signal, but\nalso of the signal-to-noise ratio, one can understand the interest SR has attracted.\nThe use of noise to control the response of a system is particularly effective when the\ndependence of the response on the noise intensity is exponentially sharp, as in the case of bi-\nand multistable systems where the noise intensity determines the probabilities of transitions\nbetween the states. It is in such systems that a sharp increase, not only in the signal\n(by orders of magnitude), but also in the signal-to-noise ratio (by more than an order of\nmagnitude) has been achieved. This paves the way for the application of SR-displaying\nsystems to signal processing, and also for revealing the role such systems may play in signal\nprocessing in biological systems.\nOne of the most interesting problems related to SR is the problem of large fluctuations,\nin particular the fluctuations that give rise to transitions between coexisting stable states.\nAlthough this is a traditional problem of condensed-matter physics (it includes nonadiabatic\ntransitions, small-polaron transport, reorientation of defects and quantum diffusion, etc),\nmany questions have not been resolved yet and are under active discussion (cf. Ref. [61]).\nEven more questions arise when this problem is considered for systems away from thermal\nequilibrium (cf. Ref. [62] and references therein). Here, many important problems are to be\nfound that have not even been addressed to the best of our knowledge, e.g. the possibility\nof the onset of SR in systems driven by shot noise. We believe that the investigation of\nthese problems and, more broadly, the analysis of the interplay of nonlinear dynamics and\nfluctuations will constitute an important direction in physics at least until early in the next\ncentury.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to R Landauer who draw our attention to the earlier research on anelastic\nrelaxation in solids, and to A Longtin and K Wiesenfeld for valuable comments on an earlier\nversion of the manuscript.
