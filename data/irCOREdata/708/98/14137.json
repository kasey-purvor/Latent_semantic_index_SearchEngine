This\npaper reflects on the experience of transferring knowledge and understanding between these two\ncommunities during the Learning Activity Design in Education project funded by the UK Joint\nInformation Systems Committee. The discussion is situated within the literature on \u2018mediating\nrepresentations\u2019 and \u2018mediating artefacts\u2019, and shows that the practical operation of mediating\nrepresentations is far more complex than previously acknowledged. The experience suggests that\nfor effective transfer of concepts between communities, the communities need to overlap to the\nextent that a single representation is comprehensible to both. This representation may be viewed as\na boundary object that is used to negotiate understanding. If the communities do not overlap a chain\nof intermediate representations and communities may be necessary. Finally, a tentative distinction\nis drawn between mediating representations and mediating artefacts, based not in the nature of the\nresources, but in their mode and context of use.\nIntroduction\nIn recent decades a host of technological tools\u2014such as online conferencing, inter-\nactive whiteboards, wikis, and so on\u2014have become available, providing new oppor-\ntunities to enhance learning (Conole, 2004; Conole & Dyke, 2004; Collis &\nMoonen, 2005). In particular, one supposed benefit of learning technologies is their\npotential for enabling teaching practitioners (teachers, lecturers, tutors, hereafter\nreferred to as \u2018practitioners\u2019) to implement new teaching methods informed by\nrecent theories of learning (see, for example, Conole & Oliver, 2007). Yet there is\n*Caledonian Academy, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow G4 0BA,\nUK. Email: isobel.falconer@gcal.ac.uk\n156 I. Falconer\nlittle sign that education has changed in any fundamental way despite substantial\ninstitutional investment in information and communications technology (Collis &\nvan der Wende, 2002). Although we now know a great deal about how to teach for\neffective learning, on the whole didactic modes with a focus on transmission of\nknowledge still predominate in post-compulsory education\u2014the potential of new\ntechnologies to enable new styles of learning is not yet being realised (Britain &\nLiber, 2004; Littlejohn, 2004). This may be because the benefits of e-learning as\nperceived by technical and educational developers (those, generally in support\ndepartments, whose role is to promote teaching excellence, develop teaching and\nlearning materials, advise faculty on pedagogic issues, etc.) are not sufficiently clear\nor easy to communicate to practitioners, as suggested by Beetham (2004; UK Joint\nInformation Systems Committee [JISC], 2006), or because they are not well aligned\nwith existing institutional structures, values and rewards as pointed out by Seufert\nand Euler (2004)\nThe solution to these problems is complex and likely to involve institutional change\nstrategically focusing on transformation in learning and teaching practice, support for\nstaff and students engaging in these new practices and implementation of new physical\nand virtual learning environments (Littlejohn & Peacock, 2003). A number of these\nstrategic changes are proving difficult for institutions. For example, linking empirically\nbased theory to practice, and recognition of valid outcomes aligned to pedagogical\ntheory, is challenging for practitioners within current organisational constraints. For\nexample, teachers may feel prevented from implementing collaborative teaching\nmethods by the need to align with institutionally imposed learning outcomes based\non a didactic approach (Falconer et al., 2007). Similarly, implementing necessary\nchanges in working practices and reward structures to provide sufficient levels of prac-\ntical support for development of e-learning practice are proving particularly problem-\natic. But all these developments require some sort of translation that makes what the\npractitioner does on the ground, and its implications, understandable and meaningful\nin practical terms to those\u2014technical, administrative and managerial\u2014providing the\nsupport, facilities and infrastructure (Beetham, 2002). Conversely, the implications\nof new theories of teaching, and the affordances of new technological tools, need to\nbe translated into terms that teachers and lecturers can put into practice. This trans-\nlation is frequently achieved through some sort of representation of practice or theory;\nfor example, a case study or model. But it is apparent that different types of represen-\ntation are likely to be understandable to different types of users\u2014a translation of a\nteaching practice that informs university management will probably be meaningless\nto a technical developer. Thus the nature of the communities involved and the purpose\nof the communication are important factors when considering how best to mediate\nand translate between them.\nMediating representations\nThe term \u2018mediating representations\u2019 is widely used in knowledge systems and cogni-\ntive science disciplines (for example, Boose, 1990). I define it as encompassing any\nMediating between services and learning activities 157\nrepresentation that enhances communication among participants and improves their\nunderstanding of a concept or practice.\nIn an empirically based study, Beetham (2001) discussed the role and usability of\nsuch representations in supporting change in teaching practice. Her examples of\nrepresentations ranged from case studies, guidelines and toolkits to computer soft-\nware and databases (see Table 1 for a fuller list). She implies a distinction between\nrepresentations of practice and representations of learning, which might equate to a\ndistinction between representations originated by teachers and representations origi-\nnated by educational theorists or psychologists. But in her analysis she treats these on\nthe same footing, being entirely concerned with the end users; in this case, teaching\npractitioners, educational developers and learning technology support staff. While\nBeetham concentrates only on very limited types of end user, she makes the valuable\npoint that even a single user might have a number of uses or types of interaction with\na representation. For example, a teacher might use a case study as a source of infor-\nmation about a pedagogic model, as a straightforward description of a lesson that\nthey can use in their own practice, or as the inspiration for a new teaching approach.\nAlternatively, the user might require different types of representation to support\ndifferent sorts of interaction. For example, while a case study might be well suited to\nproviding inspiration for a new teaching approach, it might be difficult to derive an\noperable description of a lesson from it\u2014a lesson plan might be better suited to the\nTable 1. Lists of Beetham\u2019s and Sharpe et al.\u2019s mediating representations (based on Beetham, \n2001; Sharpe et al., 2004) and Conole\u2019s mediating artefacts (from Jones & Conole, 2006)\nBeetham\u2019s and Sharpe et al.\u2019s mediating \nrepresentations Conole\u2019s mediating artefacts\nReview Narratives\nGuidelines Case studies\nStaff development material Peer dialogue\nCase study Expert guidance\nFramework\/toolkit\u2014models, templates, etc. Knowledge building\nArticle\/report Networked communication\nSoftware\u2014learning Lesson plans\nSoftware\u2014activity shell Tips and tricks\nSoftware\u2014learning object Demonstrations\nInformation resource Answer gardens\nProject\/service Frequently asked questions\nDatabases Schema\nBibliographies Toolkits\nConcept maps Models\nPatterns\nRoughly speaking, Conole characterises resources by their type and the list runs from the concrete and \ncontextualised to the abstract and conceptual, while Sharpe et al. and Beetham characterize them by their \nformat running from text-based to software-based (Littlejohn et al., 2006). This table is not designed to imply a \nmapping between the two.\n158 I. Falconer\nlatter purpose. The alignment between the purpose of a representation and its form\nis, then, crucial to its success. Beetham\u2019s interest in representations as supporting\nchange leads to a classification of six types of interaction (inform, adopt, adapt,\ncreate, guide and comment) that implies a learning cycle as practitioners embed the\nnew ideas conveyed by the representation into their practice. Similar cycles have been\nsuggested by Beetham (2002), Conole and Oliver (2001), and Mayes and Fowler\n(Fowler & Mayes, 1999; Mayes, 2001). Their work thus emphasises that teachers are\nin the position of learners when changing practice, and representations need to\nsupport the stages of a learning cycle.\nBeetham (2001) further characterises the representations along a spectrum that\nruns from text, such as articles, reviews and case studies, which are highly informa-\ntive, to software tools such as assessment tools, which are highly adoptable but less\ninformative. Such a counterposition between inform and adopt does not seem imme-\ndiately obvious, although it parallels the payoff between the acquirability and expres-\nsiveness of a representation noted by Boose (1990). Boose uses language as an\nexample: a language that is sufficiently sophisticated to convey complex ideas may be\ndifficult to acquire, while a more basic language is easier to learn but lacks the power\nto express complex concepts or fine distinctions between concepts. Beetham suggests\nthat these counter-positions are driven by time, or rather lack of time. In a follow-up\npaper, Beetham (2002) adds the nuance that lack of time is a manifestation of lack of\nsuitable institutional and reward structures. She also discusses explicitly the types of\nrepresentation that might be used by five different communities of users (learner,\nteacher, resource developer, educational developer, strategic developer), but she has\nno further empirical evidence to show how these representations do in fact mediate\nin interpreting practice across community boundaries.\nThis problem was taken up by Sharpe et al. (2004), who investigated the transfer\nof knowledge between the education researcher and practitioner communities.\nHowever, as in Beetham\u2019s previous survey, the main participants were educational\ndevelopers and practitioners rather than education researchers. The most effective\nrepresentations cited appeared to be those around which they could interact with\ncolleagues (i.e. originators and end users were part of the same, or overlapping,\ncommunities)\u2014a conclusion that is embedded within our definition of a mediating\nrepresentation as enhancing communication. However, it leaves unanswered the\nissue of how representations originating in the academic education research commu-\nnity make their way into the educational developer community in the first place.\nNot explored by Beetham, or Sharpe et al., but relevant to this last issue, is the idea\nof \u2018boundary objects\u2019. Boundary objects are a concept that originated in actor-\nnetwork theory (Star, 1989) and were adopted by Wenger (1998) and Tuomi-Grohn\nand Engestrom (2003). Boundary objects are common to the communities between\nwhom they mediate, but are viewed in different ways by those communities. They act\nto bring about coordination and negotiate understanding between the communities,\nand form a learning space in their own right (Edwards, 2005). To act as a boundary\nobject in this way, the practices of both communities must encompass the object,\nalthough not necessarily from the same perspective (i.e. the communities must have\nMediating between services and learning activities 159\na common boundary and not be too far removed from each other). If we consider\nBeetham\u2019s or Sharpe et al.\u2019s representations as boundary objects, we can see why they\nare most effective when used for communication between closely overlapping\ncommunities.\nConole (2006; Jones & Conole, 2006) discusses a very similar list of resources to\nBeetham (see Table 1), but refers to them as \u2018mediating artefacts\u2019 in an approach that\nis rooted in activity theory; her work has been followed up by Oliver (2006). Rather\nthan considering the resources as integral to the practices of a community, Conole\nviews them as tools for making decisions. Mediating artefacts will help practitioners\ndecide which technological tools and educational theories are appropriate to their\nsituation and aims. Providing support for this choice, it is argued, will help bridge the\ngap between recent educational theory and implementation in practice. Despite their\ndifferent perspectives, however, many of the conclusions of Conole\u2019s survey of medi-\nating artefacts, parallel Beetham and Sharpe et al.\u2019s. For example, she draws a contin-\nuum from open theoretical maps at one end to restrictive but easy-to-use software\ntools at the other end. And she notes that the use of models of educational theory has\nbeen criticised because practitioners may not understand how to apply them effec-\ntively\u2014she is essentially making the same point as Sharpe et al. when they find that\nthe intervention of educational developers is usually necessary between academic\ntheorist and practitioner.\nLike Beetham and Sharpe et al., Conole is essentially concerned with practitioners\nas the users of mediating artefacts, although she does mention learners and technical\ndevelopers occasionally. However, if we view the DialogPlus toolkit, developed by\nConole and others, as a representation (Conole & Fill, 2005), we begin to see how it\nmight work to mediate between the educational developer and practitioner commu-\nnities. DialogPlus is an online tool that presents practitioners with a range of options\nto help them develop effective learning activities (see Figure 1). However, the theory\nof learning that underpins the process is hidden from the user.\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the DialogPlus toolkit intended to help practitioners design technology enhanced learning activities (http:\/\/www.nettle.soton.ac.uk\/toolkit\/activities\/default.aspx?action=create)In this case, the educational developer has not intervened in person to interpret a\nmodel or theory to the practitioner, but has represented their understanding in the\ntoolkit. This highlights the structural difference between viewing such resources as\ntools and viewing them as representations: the representation view entails communi-\ncation between at least two participants, not necessarily both from the same commu-\nnity, whereas the tools view hides the role of one of the participants, embedding it\nwithin the tool.\nWe note here a confusion of terminology\u2014in that activity theory, upon which\nConole bases her account, divides mediation by artefacts into \u2018sign mediation\u2019 and\n\u2018tool mediation\u2019 (for example, Engestrom et al., 1999), with Conole\u2019s \u2018artefacts\u2019\ncorresponding to \u2018tools\u2019 while Sharpe et al.\u2019s and Beetham\u2019s use of \u2018representations\u2019\ncorresponds more closely to \u2018signs\u2019 with its emphasis on communication. However,\nother authors who have drawn on activity theory, such as Leadbetter (2004), have\nvalidly used \u2018mediating artefacts\u2019 to signify resources that are a focus for communica-\ntion. In the terms of the current paper, Leadbetter\u2019s use of resources would count as\nmediating representations.\n160 I. Falconer\nOther work that uses the language of mediating representations, such as that of\nGoodyear and Steeples (1998), similarly concentrates on communication between\nmembers of a single community, or closely overlapping communities, of practitio-\nners and educational developers. However, Beetham (2004), Sharpe et al. (2004),\nSeufert and Euler (2004), Oliver (2004), and Scott (2004) have all highlighted the\nvariety of different stakeholders in learning technology, and the multiplicity of their\npurposes in using it. These authors have begun to articulate the range of user types,\nincluding teachers, learners, technical support staff, technical developers, educa-\ntional developers, librarians, managers and evaluators. Thus there are many more\ncommunities between whom communication is necessary than have been discussed\nhitherto in the context of mediating representations, although Goodyear et al.\n(2004) in their work on patterns begin to address the gap between the more widely\ndivergent communities of practitioners and technical developers. One of the condi-\ntions for the success of the Learning Activity Design in Education (LADiE) project\nwas to bridge this gap.\nMethodology\nThis paper takes a case study approach, which uses the experience of the LADiE\nproject (http:\/\/www.elframework.org\/refmodels\/ladie; funded by the JISC) as a test\nbed for exploring a number of issues of the role of representations in transferring\nknowledge and understanding between different communities.\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the DialogPlus toolkit intended to help practitioners design technology \nenhanced learning activities (http:\/\/www.nettle.soton.ac.uk\/toolkit\/activities\/default.aspx?action= \ncreate)\nMediating between services and learning activities 161\nThe project faced the challenge of translating teaching practice in post-compulsory\neducation across a community boundary into terms that were useful to technical devel-\nopers. These experiences are situated in recent literature on the role of mediating\nrepresentations and artefacts, which provides the concepts used to analyse reflections.\nThe LADiE project: initial approach\nThe JISC-funded LADiE project was a contribution to the development of the JISC-\nDEST e-Framework for Education and Research being developed jointly by the JISC\nand the Australian Department for Education, Science and Training (DEST) (http:\/\n\/www.e-framework.org\/). The e-Framework supports a service-oriented approach to\nthe development and delivery of education. This approach reflects a move from\nmonolithic, powerful but inflexible virtual learning environments, towards a more\nflexible linking of individual \u2018service\u2019 components (such as chat and assessment tools,\netc.) via loosely coupled, standards-based, interfaces. Essential to its development is\nthe documenting of user requirements and processes in a coherent way, and to use\nthese to derive a set of interoperable network services that conform to appropriate\nstandards. The requirements are being documented in the form of \u2018reference models\u2019\nor \u2018domain maps\u2019 that will enable members of the community to collaborate in the\ndevelopment of service components that meet their needs (Olivier et al., 2005). Thus,\nit is suggested, a \u2018reference model\u2019 will provide a mediating representation that\nenables practitioners and technical developers to communicate about their require-\nments (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. A reference model is a mediating representation that enables users to communicate their requirements for the services systemA reference model provides: \n\u25cf An abstract model of what has to be accomplished to meet the needs addressed.\n\u25cf The description of the chosen means of implementing this model\u2014defined by exist-\ning and developing technologies, specifications and standards (Olivier et al., 2005).\nThe aim of the LADiE project was to develop a learning activity reference model\nthat was firmly based in practical experience of teaching and learning (http:\/\/\nwww.elframework.org\/refmodels\/ladie). In this case, the needs were defined as those\nFigure 2. A reference model is a mediating representation that enables users to communicate their \nrequirements for the services system\n162 I. Falconer\nof effective reusable learning activities. Therefore LADiE planned to use a \u2018top-down\u2019\nand \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach, documenting the requirements of effective learning activ-\nities in the form of \u2018use cases\u2019 through a series of practitioner workshops, and\nmapping these onto existing interoperability standards and specifications. Use cases\nare a way of specifying the behaviour requirements of a system, generally in a simple\ntext form (Cockburn, 2001). They are mediating representations that serve to\nenhance communication about the ways in which the user needs a system to behave\n(Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Abbreviated example of a use case specifying the requirements for running an online discussion conference derived from the LADiE projectSo we can see, already, in the initial project methodology, recognition that two\nmediating representations, the use case and the reference model, and an intermediate\ncommunity of learning technologists, seem necessary to bridge the communication\ngap between practitioners and technical developers, in developing the web services\nsystem. The communication looks more like Figure 4 than Figure 2.\nFigure 4. Communication structure and mediating representations implied by the proposed LADiE methodology\nThe LADiE project: experience\nThe project eventually documented 16 learning activities, gathered mainly from three\none-day practitioner workshops. The 30 participants were a roughly equal mix of prac-\ntitioners from higher education and further education, educational developers plus a\ncouple of secondary school teachers. They were known to be e-learning enthusiasts\nand were invited for this reason. The aim was to document activities covering a wide\nrange of possible teaching approaches and subject disciplines. Interviews with indi-\nvidual practitioners were used to fill in disciplinary gaps in workshop participation.\nThe initial intention was to get the practitioners themselves to document their\nactivities in the form of use cases, by providing them with templates similar to that of\nFigure 3, and guiding them through the writing process. We tried this in our first\nworkshop, but it proved extremely difficult to implement in the time available. Even\nwith the scaffolding provided by the templates, and experts on hand to mediate the\nprocess, considerably more experience of writing use cases would be necessary before\nthis community could utilise this type of representation of their practice effectively.\nThe main two difficulties, even for this relatively expert group of participants, were in: \n\u25cf decontextualising the learning activity and concentrating on the structure of the\nprocess; and\n\u25cf separating the roles and actions of the practitioner in the process from the aims of\nthe learner.\nAs noted in other studies, the practitioner community is accustomed to representing\nits practice in heavily contextualised forms, generally case studies (Sharpe et al., 2004;\nFalconer & Littlejohn, 2006). In the LADiE project it seemed that this customary\npractice was too far removed from that of the learning technologists developing a refer-\nence model for the gap to be bridged by a single representation type, a use case, without\na great deal of further and peripheral communication that would bring the commu-\nnities closer together. Given the time constraints highlighted by Beetham (2001), this\nmeans that the use case representation is unlikely to be effective in this user context.\nMediating between services and learning activities 163\nUse Case Summary\nTeacher runs an online a discussion conference with students\nPrimary Actor (and goal)\nTeacher To administer the discussion conference successfully\nOther Actors (and goals)\nStudents To engage in dialogue and develop concepts to pass the\ncourse\nModerator To keep conference running smoothly, both socially and\norganisationally\nPreconditions\n1 System with conferencing facilities\nMain Success Scenario\n1 Teacher sets up small group conferences in system and defines student\ngroups\n2 System attaches students to teacher-defined discussion groups\n3 Students discuss asynchronously in small group conferences\n4 Teacher monitors small group conferences\n5 System saves records of conferences\n6 Students access saved conferences for future work\nExtensions\n1a Teacher is overworked and will not have time to monitor conferences\n1a1 Teacher appoints student moderators for conferences\n3a Some messages are inappropriate\n3a1 Moderators edit or remove messages\n4a Student participation is low\n4a1 Teacher changes conference structure so new messages are more\neasily visible (e.g. by doing away with subconferences)\nFigure 3. Abbreviated example of a use case specifying the requirements for running an online \ndiscussion conference derived from the LADiE project\n164 I. Falconer\nIn subsequent LADiE workshops we abandoned this approach, and, instead, asked\nparticipants to document their activities as case studies. We provided templates that\nprompted them to detail the teaching context and learner needs explicitly, alongside\na stepwise description of what they, and their students, did during the activity (http:\/\n\/www.elframework.org\/refmodels\/ladie\/guides\/LARM_Pedagogy30-03-06.doc).\nThis approach seemed to work far better from the practitioner\u2019s perspective. We then\ntook these case studies and derived use cases from them, consulting back to the case-\nstudy authors to check our interpretations.\nThe main communication around the developing use cases, however, was among\nthe learning technologists in the LADiE team. This demonstrated clearly that we\nwere two different, although overlapping, communities of learning technologists\u2014\npractitioner focused and technically focused (the project team was deliberately put\ntogether in this way to implement the top-down, bottom-up approach)\u2014and that a\nsubstantial amount of communication between the two was necessary to develop a\nrepresentation that was meaningful and fit for purpose for both. This supports Sharpe\net al.\u2019s suggestion that representations of practice should be \u2018enhanced by their partic-\nipation in collaborative activities\u2019 (Sharpe et al., 2004). Problems and misunderstand-\nings negotiated through this process included: \n\u25cf Granularity and aggregation\u2014the granularity of a learning activity was the subject\nof much debate at workshops but most participants settled on something that had\na definable beginning, middle and end, generally in the form \u2018provide students with\nFigure 4. Communication structure and mediating representations implied by the proposed \nLADiE methodology\nMediating between services and learning activities 165\nsome information, set a task based on the information, report on the result of the\ntask\u2019. Such activities comprised a number of different subactivities (e.g. information\ngathering, discussion forum, report writing), but these tended to be similar from\none activity to another. In writing the use cases it often proved more effective to\ndisaggregate these subactivities and re-aggregate the functionality required of simi-\nlar ones together into generic use cases such as the discussion shown in Figure 3.\n\u25cf Breadth versus depth\u2014the initial conception of the practitioner-focused team\nmembers was that the documented learning activities should cover as wide a range\nof service components as possible. However, negotiation over the form of the use\ncases demonstrated that this supposition was based on a false assumption of the\nsophistication of existing interoperability standards. What the technically focused\nteam members needed was to develop a core reference model based on an in-depth\nanalysis of the requirements of a limited number of core functions such as discus-\nsions and quizzes. The purpose of the case studies, from their viewpoint, was to\nidentify which these core functions were.\nThus, collaborating over development of use cases proved a very effective means of\nbridging this partial gap between the two overlapping communities of learning\ntechnologists.\nThus, the eventual structure and mediating representations that proved necessary\nin the LADiE project to provide meaningful communication between all communi-\nties of users looked something like Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Communication structure and mediating representations used in the LADiE projectHowever, once the project was completed and the reference model written, these\nactive communications disappeared. The reference model was written in three\nFigure 5. Communication structure and mediating representations used in the LADiE project\n166 I. Falconer\nparallel parts, aimed at technical developers, learning technologists and practitioners,\nreflecting recognition that the practices and purposes of these communities are\nsufficiently different that a single representation would not be meaningful to all of\nthem. Once written and stabilised, it was envisaged that the reference model would\nmediate between users and services as in Figure 1. As in the case of Conole and Fill\u2019s\nDialogPlus toolkit, the role of the originating participants (practitioners and learning\ntechnologists) is hidden, embedded within the model, and the model could be viewed\nas a tool for the user. In this case it might be more appropriate to consider the model\nas a mediating artefact, in line with Conole\u2019s perspective, than as a mediating repre-\nsentation that enhances communication. It is early days yet to tell whether it will\nbe possible to use the reference model unambiguously in this way, or whether as\nnoted by Conole (2006) such a formalised representation leaves sufficient gaps of\ninterpretation that communication between the end user and the originator or\nanother \u2018expert\u2019 is necessary for effective use.\nDiscussion\nOur experience as users of representations to mediate communication between a vari-\nety of communities has shown that the process is considerably more complex than is\napparent from previous studies in the learning technology literature based on single\nor closely related communities.\nIn particular, it seems that gaps between some communities, even those united\naround a common endeavour such as teachers communicating their needs to techni-\ncal developers, are too wide to be bridged by a single type of representation. In the\nLADiE project it took at least three communication steps\u2014each centred around a\ndifferent type of mediating representation, and involving two intermediate communi-\nties of participants\u2014to migrate a concept of system requirements from practitioner to\ntechnical developer. In each of these steps the communities overlapped: practitio-\nners\u2013practitioner-focused learning technologists; practitioner-focused\u2013technically-\nfocused learning technologists; technically-focused learning technologists\u2013technical\ndevelopers. The overlap allowed active reciprocal communication between origina-\ntors and end users around the representation\u2014that this is necessary is for migrating\nconcepts is suggested by Sharpe et al. (2004) and by Conole\u2019s (2006) work on effec-\ntive mediation, and is assumed in our definition of a mediating representation.\nThe necessity we found for overlap between communities supports an interpreta-\ntion of our representations as boundary objects that enabled a transfer of concepts\nfrom one community to another. At each step the practices of both communities\nencompassed the representation used, although they viewed it from different perspec-\ntives. Eventually, a chain of such steps allowed us to transfer concepts from the\npractitioner to technical developer communities.\nIn the LADiE project the overlapping communities were sufficiently close in their\npractices, language and modes of thinking to be able to communicate around the\nrepresentation within a reasonable time frame. The time-driven constraints on effec-\ntive representations noted by Beetham (2001, 2002) and Conole (2006) were most\nMediating between services and learning activities 167\napparent at the first stage, documenting practitioners\u2019 learning activities. They\nbecame less significant at the second and third stages where participants (project team\nmembers) were being rewarded explicitly for communicating concepts. In developing\nthe use cases, when relatively free from time constraints, we had representations that\nseemed both information rich and highly adoptable by learning technologists.\nHowever, the same representations proved neither adoptable nor informative to the\npractitioner community, and this underlines the obvious point that representations\nneed to be tailored to the practice of their participants. When we consider the number\nof different combinations of communities that may need to communicate or collabo-\nrate during e-learning projects, the complexity of finding appropriate representations\nbecomes apparent.\nFinally, I suggest that, as the mediating representations reach a stable form and\ncease to be the locus of reciprocal communication, it may be possible to view them\ninstead as \u2018mediating artefacts\u2019 or tools, in line with Conole\u2019s work. Thus, as implied\nby our initial overview, the distinction between \u2018mediating representation\u2019 and \u2018medi-\nating artefact\u2019 is one of the processes employed and the context of use, rather than of\nthe nature of the resources.\nConclusions\nI have used the experience of the LADiE project as a case study of the processes\ninvolved in communicating ideas between different communities. These processes\nhave been articulated in terms of the concepts of mediating representations, medi-\nating artefacts and boundary objects. Our experience supports the following\nconclusions: \n\u25cf The process of using representations to communicate between different commu-\nnities is considerably more complex than hitherto recognised in the learning\ntechnology literature.\n\u25cf For effective communication, communities must overlap, and the representations\nused should be common to both, forming \u2018boundary objects\u2019.\n\u25cf If communities do not overlap, then a series of communications between interme-\ndiate, and overlapping, communities is necessary using representations appropriate\nto each step.\n\u25cf A significant number of different representation forms are needed to support\ncommunication between the large number of combinations of communities that\nmay need to communicate or collaborate during e-learning projects.\n\u25cf The counterposition between informative and adoptable, or acquirability and\nexpressiveness, noted in the literature is a consequence of time constraints, as\nsuggested by Beetham. For effective communication, time has to be made available.\n\u25cf In a \u2018mediating artefact\u2019 the input of the originating community is embedded and\nhidden, but is still present: the distinction between \u2018mediating representation\u2019 and\n\u2018mediating artefact\u2019 depends on the context of use, rather than on the nature of the\nresource.\n168 I.
