INTRODUCTION \nAdvanced carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have been widely used in the aerospace \nindustry, and the application is going to increase rapidly in order to reduce the payload and \nhence to enhance the performance. However, the poor properties in the through-thickness \ndirection make CFRPs particularly susceptible to low velocity impact damage. This damage \ncan be caused by dropping tools, runway debris, or flying through hailstorms. This impact \ndamage is of particular concern because it is often barely visible from the impacted side. \nThere may only be a small indent on the impacted face while significant delamination exists \ninternally and significant matrix cracking exists on the back face. Due to the nature of \naircraft structures, the back face of the laminate is often in an area that is not easily \naccessible and thus the damage often goes undetected. This damage can seriously degrade \nthe laminate\u2019s compressive strength. Because this kind of damage often goes undetected, \ndesigners must allow for this so-called barely visible impact damage (BVID). A design \n                                                          \n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +44 1234 754621; Fax: +44 1234 758203.

The first method is to improve the detection \ncapability of the BVID. Adding more access panels to allow visual inspection of the back \nface is often unpractical due to the number of access panels required and their location on \nleading edges and flight controls. Detecting the damage using non-destructive testing such as \nc-scan or x-ray is also unpractical due to the amount of time required for the testing and the \nremoval of components from the aircraft. The second method is to improve the through-\nthickness properties of the laminate in an attempt to reduce the accidental damage or to make \nthe parts more damage tolerant under the service loads and operational conditions. Stitching \nor inserting short rods or pins in the thickness direction (often referred to as the z-direction) \nhave been shown to greatly improve the fracture toughness in modes I and II [6]. The \nrecently developed Z-Fibre technique involves inserting metal pins or cured carbon fibre \npins into the laminate through the laminate thickness, and it offers significant improvement \nin impact resistance, compression-after-impact (CAI) strength, and the ultimate strength of \nstiffener pull-off [6-10].  \nAlthough the number of studies on impact performance of z-pinned laminates is very \nlimited, it has been repeatedly reported in the literature that z-fibre pinning results in \nseverely restricted size and growth of impact damage, and substantially improved CAI \nstrength. Dickinson et al comprehensively reviewed the through-thickness reinforcement \ntechnique during its early development period of 1989-99, and summarised that by z-\npinning the CAI strength was improved by up to 50%, impact damage area was reduced by \nup to 55%, and the critical strain energy release rates were increased by a factor of 18 [6]. In \n[10] the structural response to impact damage of a generic skin-stringer panel was \ninvestigated. The stringer panel was pinned with 15 mm wide bands of z-fibres to the skin \nadjacent to the stringers. Low velocity impacts (35 J) were then introduced in the bay and \nover the stringer foot, and the panels were subsequently subjected to compression test until \nfailure. Although the impact sites were not located at the z-pinned regions, delamination \ncracking was restricted in the pinned regions achieving significant improvements in impact \nresistance and post-impact compressive strength. For the bay impacts, the presence of the z-\npins appeared to have reduced the impact damage area by 40% and a 32% increase in CAI \nstrength was observed. Regarding the different damage stages, work in [9] has shown that z-\npinning does not improve the resistance to the onset of delamination damage. In fact, the \ncritical impact force associated with the initiation of delamination in a quasi-isotropic \nsample is lowered by the presence of the z-pins. However, z-pinning does reduce the scale \nof delamination growth. For a given impact energy z-pinned samples exhibit considerably \nsmaller overall delamination area than their unpinned counterparts [9].           \nIn this paper, we aim at investigating the effect of z-pinning on the initiation and \npropagation stages of delamination damage due to low velocity impact, and the subsequent \ncompressive strength. The study was carried out over a range of specimen thicknesses and \nimpact energies in order to determine the effectiveness of z-pinning and its dependency on \nsample thickness and impact energy. The impact tests were analysed in terms of the critical \nimpact force and damage area. The CAI tests were discussed in the context of an FE model \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 3\nthat simulates the z-pin bridging effects and the increased apparent fracture toughness of z-\npinned laminates.   \n \n2. EXPERIMENTAL \nAll specimens were manufactured from one batch of carbon\/epoxy T300\/914C \nunidirectional pre-preg of nominal thickness 0.125 mm supplied by Hexcel Composites. The \nbasic material properties for the pre-preg were obtained from the manufacturer and are given \nin Table 1. All samples were 100 mm by 150 mm with nominal thicknesses of 2, 4, and 6 \nmm. To manufacture these specimens, four larger panels, each 660 mm by 360 mm, were \nfabricated. All panels had a quasi-isotropic lay-up sequence: [0\/+45\/90\/-45]2S for the 2 mm \nthick panel, [-45\/0\/+45\/90]4S for the 4 mm panel, and [0\/+45\/90\/-45]6S for the two 6 mm \nthick panels. Half of the specimens of each thickness were pinned at the plate centre with a \npinned area of 50 x 50 mm as illustrated in Fig. 1a.        \nThe Z-fibres were made of T300 carbon fibres embedded in bismaleimide (BMI) resin. \nThese pins were held in a foam perform to support them as they were inserted into the \nuncured panel using a UAZ-2000TM ultrasonic insertion gantry which allowed the pins to be \ninserted with a vertically applied uniform force. In this study the pin diameter was 0.28 mm \nand the areal density of the pins was 2% resulting in a distance of 1.75 mm between adjacent \npins. After the pins were sheared, the panels were cured. Following the post-cure, the panels \nwere each cut into twelve individual 150 mm by 100 mm specimens.  \nThe support fixture for the impact tests is shown in Fig. 1a. Each specimen was held in \nplace by four clamps with rubber tips. There is a 125 x 75 mm cutout below the specimen. \nThe four clamps can be adjusted in height to accommodate the different specimen \nthicknesses so that all specimens of that thickness were clamped with approximately the \nsame force. The fixture provides a support that is very close to the clamped boundary \ncondition along the 125 mm by 75 mm window edges, but bending is not fully constrained. \nThe impact tests were performed on a Rosand Instrumented Falling Weight Impact Tester \n(Type 5). In all impact tests, the impact energy was set. A hemispherical steel striker was \nused. The striker diameter was 20 mm and the striker mass was 0.177 kg. The total drop \nmass and height were changed to accommodate the wide variety of impact energies. The \ndrop mass, drop height, impact energy, and the number of samples used for each test case \nare listed in Table 2. The force and time histories were recorded by a high-speed transient \nrecorder. An optical triggering source was used to initiate recording. About 4000 data points \nwere recorded over a sweep time of 10 ms with 2% of the data points recorded prior to the \nimpact event.  \nAfter impact tests, all the 4 mm thick specimens and selected 6 mm specimens were \nsubjected to compression tests to determine their compression-after-impact (CAI) \ncharacteristics and strength. The support rig is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The specimens were \nfully clamped at both loaded edges and simply supported on the sides to prevent global \nbuckling during the compression tests. This ensured that the specimens failed by \ndelamination propagation at the impact position. The window size of the CAI support is \n85.5 mm by 134 mm. All tests were performed under displacement control at a rate of 1.5 \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 4\nmm\/min. Data sets of the load and displacement were obtained at a rate of 10 data sets per \nsecond. From these data sets, the initial displacement of the machine when load is first \napplied, the force at failure of the specimen and the displacement of the machine at failure \nof the specimen were obtained for all specimens. Details of the impact and compression \ntests can be found in [11].  \n \n3. RESULTS & ANALYSIS  \n3.1 Damage area \nIn this study, the damage area was measured by ultrasonic C-scan imaging. Therefore, the \nterm delamination area means the projected delaminated area and not calculated cumulative \nareas of superimposed delamination layers. The general shape of delamination area was \nroughly circular. Fig. 2 shows typical C-scan images of impact damage for the 4 mm thick \nplates impacted at 15J. The unpinned plate also had an additional and much larger \ndelamination at the interface between the last ply and its adjacent layer due to the bending \neffect [5, 12].     \nFig. 3 shows delamination area plotted as a function of impact energy for all specimens \ntested. The results also show that the delamination area increased almost linearly with the \nimpact energy, and for a given impact energy the pinned specimen had a smaller damage \narea than that of unpinned counterpart. The effect of z-pinning is significant and is ranked \nby the order of the specimen thickness.  \nThe average damage area for each specimen thickness at a given impact energy is given in \nTable 3. For the 2 mm thick specimens impacted at 3J and 5J incident energies, the pinning \nreduced the damage area by 19-38% and the effectiveness of the pins increased with the \nimpact energy. For the 4 mm specimens impacted at 15J and 20J incident energies, the pins \nwere much more effective at restricting the damage area, reducing the damage area by 40-\n46%. The effectiveness of the pins also increased with the impact energy but the increase \nwas not as great as for the 2 mm specimens. For the 6 mm specimens impacted at 20-40 J, \nthe pins were even more effective at restricting the damage area than they were for the 4 \nmm specimens reducing the damage area by 58-64%. However, the effectiveness of the pins \ndecreased slightly with increasing impact energy.  \nThe pins became more effective as the sample\u2019s thickness increased. This is due to the \nchange of the failure mode. For a thinner plate the bending failure mode dominates \nresulting in matrix cracking (fibre splitting) near the back face of the laminate, whereas for \na thicker panel the impact force is mostly reacted by the interlaminar shear stresses \nresulting in delamination damage [5]. In this work, the thin (2 mm thick) specimens failed \nmore in bending mode than in transverse shear, but vice versa for the thick (6 mm) \nspecimens. The pins are more effective in arresting or retarding delamination cracks from \npropagating under interlaminar shear stresses than responding to the bending stress that \ncauses in-plane matrix cracking; hence pinning is more effective in the thicker laminates. \nThe thin samples failed by a combination of in-plane matrix cracking and interlaminar \nfracture; the pins are only effective for the latter failure mode, i.e. delamination. \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 5\nThe effectiveness of the pins in the 6 mm specimens decreased slightly as the impact energy \nreached the highest level of 40J. This means that the pins became less effective when the \nfailure mode switched from delamination growth to perforation damage. \n \n3.2 Critical impact force, Pcr  \nIt is inappropriate for structural designers to use impact energy as a design parameter \nagainst impact damage. This is because the threshold impact energy for damage initiation is \ndependent on impact location, component dimensions and boundary conditions. Several \nstudies have shown that delamination damage is initiated when the impact force reaches a \ncritical value [12-15]. \nFig. 4 shows an example of the force history of an impact event. There are three meaningful \nforce values related to the damage process as identified by various researchers. Reference \n[14] provides clear definition of these forces which is given below. The load increases until \na sudden drop occurs (at point A of the curve). The load at point A is defined as the critical \nforce for onset of delamination, Pcr. This delamination process is accompanied by a rapid \nreduction of the force to a rest value Pr (point B) due to reduction in the transverse stiffness \nof the laminate. A reloading phase of the specimen to a maximum point Pmax (point C) may \noccur if enough residual potential energy is stored in the impactor. In fact Pmax is also \nrelated to the target plate stiffness after the initial impact damage at Pcr. \nIn this study the measured average critical impact forces for three different thicknesses are \ngiven in Table 4 for both pinned and unpinned samples. There are two observations based \non these results. Firstly, for each thickness the pinned samples had a slightly lower critical \nimpact force. This is due to the fact that z-pinning results in a more compliant laminate \n(reduction in the equivalent elastic modulus E [16-17]), and this will lead to a reduction in \nPcr as will be demonstrated in the calculation of Pcr below. Secondly, the difference in Pcr \nbetween the pinned and unpinned samples increases as the laminate becomes thicker. This is \ndue to the different failure modes of the thick and thin. Failure of the thin laminates (2 mm) \nwas dominated by bending induced in-plane strains and to a lesser extent by the transverse \nshear strains, whereas the thicker plates (4 and 6 mm) failed mainly due to delamination \nresulting from the interlaminar shear stresses caused by the impact force [5]. Extensive \nexperimental work has shown that the critical force does not depend on impact energy and it \nis also independent of specimen dimensions and boundary conditions [11-15]. The \nindependency of sample size and boundary conditions was also studied numerically and \nexperimentally in [18]. However we have found that for each thickness higher impact \nenergy resulted in a slightly lowered Pcr.     \nThe critical impact force must be achieved for delamination damage to initiate. The \nfollowing equation was proposed for estimating the value of the critical impact force [19]: \n    \nIICcr G\nEtP \u22c5\u2212= )1(9\n8\n2\n32\n\u03c5\n\u03c0    (1) \nwhere E is the equivalent elastic modulus of the laminate in the 0o and 90o direction, \u03bd the \nPoisson\u2019s ratio, t the laminate thickness, and GIIC the material fracture toughness under \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 6\nmode II loading. Given that E,\u03bd, and GIIC are material constants, the critical impact force is \nproportional to the sample\u2019s thickness at the order of t3\/2, which has been verified by \nexperimental results [12-15].  \nSince Pcr depends only on the material properties and plate thickness, it is also possible to \npredict the critical force of z-pinned laminates under impact loading. The values of GIIC , E \nand \u03bd of z-pinned laminate are needed for eq. (1). Because the mode II delamination \ntoughness GIIC is mainly a property of the resin matrix system, in this study the toughness \nvalue for unpinned laminate has been used as the delamination toughness for pinned \nlaminate for predicting the onset of delamination damage. This assumption is not \nunreasonable. Resistance to mode II crack growth is provided by the component of the pin \nforce that is parallel to the crack planes. This force component is proportional to the sine \nvalue of the pin rotation angle, which initially is zero and then increases as the pins rotate \nduring crack growth. Test reported in [9] has confirmed that z-pinning does not improve the \nresistance to the onset of impact damage. It is in the delamination growth regime that z-pins \nare most effective [9, 20]; hence the impact damage size is much reduced compared to the \nunpinned laminates. In this study, GIIC = 530 J\/m2 was used, which was obtained from the \ntest of 3-point end notch flexural samples of the same material [21]. This toughness value \ncorresponds to 5% offset from the curve non-linearity. Regarding the elastic constant E, it \nhas been found that the in-plane elastic moduli of z-pinned laminates are reduced as the \nresult of pinning [16, 17]. For similar materials the equivalent modulus (E) of pinned \nlaminates was found to be approximately 7-10% lower than the unpinned value [17]. By \napplying the laminate theory the calculated modulus (E) is 51.5 GPa for the unpinned \nlaminate with quasi-isotropic layup. For the 2% density pinned laminate E = 48 GPa \n(assuming 7% reduction), and \u03bd = 0.28 for both pinned and unpinned laminates. The critical \nimpact forces for the pinned and unpinned plates were then calculated and indicated in Fig. \n5. These predicted Pcr values are close to the lower bound of the experimentally measured \ncritical forces. Allowing scatters in testing, the experimental average value shows that Pcr is \nindependent of the impact energy for a given thickness. The decrease in critical force of the \npinned laminate is due to the reduction in the equivalent elastic constant (E) of the pinned \nlaminates.  \nIn some situations it may be decided that delamination is to be avoided at all cost; in which \ncase Eq. (1) is all that is needed for calculating the threshold force Pcr provided that the \nimpact force history can be either computed or measured. However, many designers will \nstill prefer to evaluate the threshold energy, because it is easier to estimate the potential \nenergy of impact incidents occurring in manufacture and service. After examining a large \namount of impact test data, Schoeppner and Abrate [15] reported that a clear energy \nthreshold for damage initiation is not apparent. An analytical method to calculate the energy \nthreshold (Wcr) was proposed by Davies et al [22]:  \n   \u2211++=\n+ )(\n0\n1\n][\n1\nctP\nn\nn\ncr\ncr Pdk\nP\nn\nkW\n\u03b4 \u03b4    (2) \nwhere Pcr is the critical impact force, and \u03b4 is the plate central deflection under applied force \nP. The nonlinear force-displacement relation can be found by either a static FE analysis of \nthe impacted panel with correct boundary conditions or the Timoshenko plate theory for \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 7\nsimple geometries. Constant k is the contact stiffness and in the classical Hertz contact \nproblem n = 1.5.  \nExperiments in [22] have shown that this method is accurate enough for predicting the onset \nof impact damage for both large and small quasi-isotropic laminated plates if there is no \nfibre breakage caused by impact. In this study, experimental tests were conducted to \ndetermine the energy threshold for the 2 mm thick plates. At 2J impact energy, no \ndelamination was observed experimentally. At 3J energy, average delamination damage \narea of 103 mm2 for the pinned samples and 127 mm2 for the unpinned were observed \n(Table 3). The average maximum deflection at the impact point was 2.73 mm and 2.86 mm \nfor the pinned and unpinned samples, respectively. Predicted energy threshold by Eq. (2) for \ndamage initiation in the same sized quasi-isotropic 2 mm thick plate was just 2J for fully \nclamped edges and 3J for simply-supported edges [22]. The test samples in this study were \nall supported in the condition close to the clamped case but not fully constrained, therefore \nthe threshold energy should be between 2 and 3J and indeed the test results has confirmed \nthis.  \n \n3.3 Impact force history  \nThe force vs. time histories of the pinned and unpinned specimens were recorded. A smooth \ntrace with sinusoidal feature indicates little or no damage in the specimen. Drops in the \ntrace or truncated peak force indicate damage with the amount of damage being \nproportional to the height of the drop and the number of drops. Fig. 6a shows the behaviour \nof the thinner plates (2 mm) impacted at 5J, whereas the response the thicker plates (6 mm) \nimpacted at 20J is shown in Fig. 6b. High frequency oscillations are present through the \nwhole duration of the event.  \nFor the 2 mm specimen impacts, there were very few drops in the trace and the height of the \ndrops was relatively small. This indicates little delamination damage in the specimens, and \nthe main damage was caused by matrix cracking due to bending. For the 5J impacts (Fig. \n6a), the height of the drops of the pinned samples was slightly smaller than that of the \nunpinned indicating that the pinned specimens were less damaged than the unpinned \nspecimens. \nFor the 6 mm thick specimens (Fig. 6b), the impact event for the unpinned specimens lasted \nslightly longer than that of the pinned. This is due to the difference in specimen toughness \nafter the delamination initiation at P= Pcr. The pinned specimens were tougher (hence less \ndamage propagation) than the unpinned samples and therefore could recover faster from the \nimpact event and hold a higher peak force after damage initiation. The pinned specimens \nhad a smoother trace compared to the unpinned, indicating less damage to the pinned \nspecimens. For all impact energies, the height of the force drops in pinned samples was \nmuch smaller than that of the unpinned. These drops were also less frequent for the pinned \nspecimens.   \nThere are two possible explanations to why z-pinning does not improve the resistance to \ndelamination initiation. Firstly, the bond between the pins and the base laminate is relatively \nweak due to the resin pockets around the pins. Secondly, the pins are initially placed vertical \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 8\nto the mode II crack plane; therefore they are not effective in resisting damage initiation. \nAfter damage initiation, the resistance to mode II crack growth is provided by the \ncomponent of the pin traction force that is parallel to the crack plane and increases as the \npins rotate during crack growth. Consequently, the damage area of pinned laminate was \nmuch smaller even though the damage was initiated at a slightly lower critical force \ncompared to the unpinned plate. Hence the reduction in delamination area is due to the pins \ntraction action during crack growth rather than the physical bond.      \n \n3.4 Energy absorption during impact   \nThe energy absorbed by the specimen is calculated by integrating the impact force over the \nplate centre deflection using the recorded force-deflection plots.  Fig. 7 shows the absorbed \nenergy versus the actual impact energy. In all cases, the pinned specimens absorbed less \nenergy than the unpinned specimens. As the thickness of the specimen increased and as the \nimpact energy increased, the difference in the absorbed energy between the pinned and \nunpinned also increased. Because all specimens were supported with the same boundary \nconditions, the decrease in absorbed energy means that less energy was consumed in \ndamage growth in the pinned specimens. Some dissipated energy in the pinned samples is \nassociated with the pins pulling out process, which also absorbs energy. However, since \nimpact damage is dominated by mode II delamination, the amount of energy dissipation due \nto z-pin traction is relatively small compared to that of mode I fracture, which is discussed \nin the next section.  \n \n3.5 CAI strength \nAll the 4 mm thick specimens and selected 6 mm specimens (three pinned and three \nunpinned for each energy level) were compressed to failure. The 2 mm thick samples were \nnot subjected to CAI testing. For both the 4 mm and 6 mm specimens, the ultimate strength \nof the undamaged plain laminate under uniaxial compression was predicted to be 515 MPa \nusing the Tsai-Hill failure criterion. Details of calculation can be found in [11]. Due to the \nlimited numbers of test samples, no compression test was performed for undamaged plates. \nThe CAI tests show that the residual strength for unpinned samples was about 150-170 MPa \nfor the 4 mm plates and 140-225 MPa for the 6 mm thick plates. This result suggests that all \nthe specimens failed by delamination propagation caused by local buckling that initiated at \nthe impact damage location. Evidence of the local buckling can be found in Fig. 8. Due to \nthe traction force offered by the z-fibres, the pinned specimens had much smaller damage \nsize and significantly slower delamination growth rate; it took approximately five seconds \nfrom visible damage growth to final failure for the unpinned specimens while it took an \napproximately six times longer loading process for the pinned specimens. The pinned \nspecimens did not fail until the visible damage had extended to the entire width of the \npinned area. Consequently, the CAI strength of the pinned samples was significantly higher \nthan that of the unpinned samples. The local buckling failure mode is sketched in Fig. 9 \nwhere the z-fibre traction force (bridging action) is also indicated. The effectiveness of z-\npinning is mainly due to the process of z-pin pullout which consumes large amounts of \nenergy as a result of the friction between the z-pins and the surrounding base laminate.    \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 9\nThe average CAI strength values are presented in Table 5 and individual sample\u2019s residual \nstrength as function of impact energy are presented in Fig. 10. All experimental results, \nincluding two anomalous ones, are included. The pinned specimens all failed at \napproximately 45% higher stress than the unpinned specimens. The only exception was the \n6 mm thick specimens impacted at 20 J. This may be due to the fact that the pinned 6 mm \nspecimens impacted at 20 J were the first specimens subjected to compression testing. The \nfirst two specimens tested were not clamped into the support with the same force as all the \nother specimens. If these two anomalous results are removed, the difference between the \npinned and unpinned results becomes 42%. The degree of CAI strength improvement was \nfound to be relatively independent of specimen thickness and impact energy.    \nThe compressive failure strains of all unpinned samples were above 0.6%, whereas they \nwere above 0.9% for all pinned samples. If a factor of 1.5 were introduced to account for \nmanufacturing differences and hot\/wet performance of the laminate, a conservative design \nstrain to failure limit would be 0.4% for the unpinned specimens and 0.6% for the pinned \nspecimens \u2013 a 50% improvement. \n3.6 Z-pin bridging effect in mode I delamination  \nThe significant improvement in residual compressive strength by z-pinning can be \nexplained by two factors. Firstly, the impact damage area is considerably smaller for the \npinned plates resulting in higher CAI strength; the amount of improvement depends on \nsample\u2019s thickness and impact energy, but the reduction in impact damage area is \nrelatively small due to z-pin bridging the mode II dominated fracture as discussed in \nSection 3.4. However, the difference in CAI strength between the pinned and unpinned is \nmuch larger than that in impact damage area and the improvement by pinning remained \nrelatively constant at 42-45% for all specimen thicknesses and all impact energies, \nsuggesting a second factor that is independent of the sample thickness and impact damage \nsize. It is the z-fibre bridging mechanism for mode I fracture that significantly delays the \ndelamination crack growth.  \nThe CAI test in this study is dominated by the mode I interlaminar delamination fracture as \nillustrated in Fig. 9. The actual damage pattern in this study is complex with multiple \nlayers of delamination (Fig. 8) and is very difficult to model in details. However, the effect \nof z-pin bridging mode I crack can be demonstrated quantitatively by a simple double \ncantilever beam (DCB) model. This is discussed below.       \nThere are studies on the bridging effects offered by through-thickness reinforcements, such \nas stitching [23] and z-pinning [24-25]. Our recent work on z-pinned double cantilever \nbeam [25] has found that the effectiveness of z-pinning is mainly owing to the formation of \na large scale bridging (LSB) zone (see FE model in Fig. 11). Once a delamination crack \nhas propagated several millimetres into the z-fibre field, those pins within the LSB zone \nwill bridge the delamination crack. The LSB process can slow down or even temporally \narrests the delamination crack. The mechanism of this bridging effect is the z-fibre pullout \nprocess during stable crack growth, which applies traction force to the crack surface. This \nprocess absorbs considerable amount of the stored strain energy that would otherwise be \nconsumed for delamination growth.  \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 10\nThe assumption made by linear elastic fracture mechanics that all energy dissipations are \nincluded in the fracture energy and confined in a small zone of the damage front is not \nvalid for z-pinned laminates. A recent study [25] has shown that the irreversible energy \ndissipation due to z-pin pulling out is the dominant term in the energy balance equation \nand thus it enhances the apparent fracture toughness of the reinforced laminates. This can \nbe demonstrated as follows. With reference to the mode I delamination of z-pinned \nlaminate, define:  \n \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u22c5=\nda\ndU\nda\ndW\nB\nG eI\n1 ,  \nda\nd\nB\nGIC\n\u0393= 1 ,   \nda\ndU\nB\nir\nir \u22c5=\u03a6 1          (3) \nwhere, GI is the strain energy release rate due to applied force, GIC the fracture toughness \nof unpinned laminate (a material property), and \u03a6ir the energy dissipation rate due to the \nprocess of z-pins pullout, which is the toughening mechanism of z-pinned laminates. W, \nUe, Uir and \u0393 are respectively the total external work, stored elastic strain energy, \nirreversible energy dissipation and energy for creating new fracture surfaces, and B is the \nthickness of DCB sample. Therefore, the Griffith type fracture criterion for z-pinned \nlaminates can be written as: \n irICI GG \u03a6+=       (4) \nThese energy rates have been calculated for a pinned DCB specimen using the finite \nelement method and the relation of the strain energy release rate with the apparent fracture \ntoughness are found [25]. A sample calculation of various energy rates is presented in Fig. \n12 as a demonstrator. The result indicates that \u03a6ir is not a material constant; it depends \nalso on the pinning parameters, crack length, and crack opening displacement. As the crack \npropagates \u03a6ir increases rapidly and when the crack is sufficiently long (e.g. a > 20 mm in \nthis case) \u03a6ir is a magnitude higher than GIC. It is the increased apparent fracture \ntoughness ( irICG \u03a6+ ) that provides increased CAI strength for z-pinned laminates. \nTherefore z-pinning is very effective for damage tolerance design especially under the \nmode I dominated loading. \nIt should be pointed out that the fracture toughness values (for both pinned and unpinned) \nobtained from the DCB configurations with unidirectional plies are much lower than the \nactual fracture toughness of the quasi-isotropic laminates in the CAI tests. The latter have \nhigher fracture toughness due to the in-plane fibre bridging action on multiple layer \ndelamination cracks. Nevertheless, DCB test still provides valuable material characteristics \nfor structural design. Another point to make is that material improvement alone is not \nenough; integration of advanced materials with new design concept especially detailed \ndesign at critical locations should be the way forward for structural application of the z-\nfibre technology. \n \nPublished in Composites Science and Technology, 66 (2006): 2785-2794 \n 11\nCONCLUSIONS \nZ-fibre pinning improves the resistance to low velocity impact. For all specimen \nthicknesses and impact energies studied in this work, the pinned specimens suffered less \ndamage than the unpinned specimens; pinning has reduced damage area by up to 64% \ndepending on sample\u2019s thickness and impact energy. Pinning was more effective for the \nthicker specimens as well as for the higher impact energy. \nFor pinned laminate, the critical impact force is slightly lowered whereas the maximum \nimpact force is higher than that of unpinned samples under the same impact energy. The \nreduced critical force is due to the pinned laminates being more compliant, whereas the \nincreased maximum force is the consequence of less impact damage in the pinned plates. \nThe effectiveness of z-pinning is in the delamination propagation stage rather than the \ndamage initiation stage. \nZ-pinning also significantly improves the compression-after-impact strength. The pinned \nspecimens had an approximately 45% higher residual strength than the unpinned \ncounterparts. The degree of CAI strength improvement is found to be relatively \nindependent of specimen thickness and impact energy, and it is dependent on the \nmagnitude of z-fibre traction force that is a function of pinning parameters and crack \nlength. All the pinned specimens had higher failure strains than the unpinned specimens. \nResults in this work indicate that the use of z-fibres could increase the design strain limit \nfor aircraft structures by about 50%. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nMG was supported by the UK DTI CARAD programme; LH was supported by the \nCanadian Forces while she conducted the research at Cranfield University.
