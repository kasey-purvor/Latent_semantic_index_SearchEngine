This room-temperature plasma posttreatment was found to be an efficient process\nin suppressing the extrinsic photoresponse of CVD diamond UV photodetectors in the visible\nregion. Nearly four orders of magnitude difference in the photoresponsivity between the UV and\nvisible light regions were obtained.

Among the various material treatments, McKeag et\nal.3 demonstrated that a methane-air treatment at a high tem-\nperature of 700 \u00b0C can lead to a virtual extinction of any\nextrinsic photoresponse, greatly decreasing the photorespon-\nsivity of diamond photodetectors in the visible light region,\nbut the substitution of either gaseous environment for inert\nspecies such as argon or nitrogen did not produce the same\neffect. On the other hand, plasma posttreatment at room tem-\nperature to efficiently improve the performance of diamond\nUV photodetectors has not been reported. In this letter, we\nreport a room-temperature post deposition process applied to\nCVD diamond samples. This process, which employed a\nplasma of oxygen and carbon tetrafluoride, was simple in\noperation and low cost. This resulted in an improved UV\nphotoresponse at 225 nm, by nearly four orders of magnitude\nwith respect to the visible wavelength.\nThe CVD diamond samples used in this study were\ngrown on silicon substrates in a microwave plasma-enhanced\nCVD sMPECVDd reactor s1.5 kW and 2.45 GHzd using 1%\nmethane diluted in hydrogen as a feed gas and with a sub-\nstrate temperature of 720 \u00b0C. The as-grown diamond films\nhad a thickness of 20 mm and a polycrystalline structure with\na mean grain size of 14 mm at the growth surface. Photoli-\nthography was used to form an interdigitated planar array of\n25 mm wide gold contacts, with a 25 mm interstrip spacing\non the top surface of the diamond samples. Some of the\nphotodetectors were then subjected to a treatment in the\nplasma of oxygen and carbon tetrafluoride at room tempera-\nture s23\u00b12 \u00b0Cd. The process conditions were a pressure of\n30 mTorr, a radio frequency srfd power s13.56 MHzd of\n300 W and a reaction gas mixture of 90% carbon tetrafluo-\nride and 10% oxygen. This was performed in a commercial\nreactive ion etching system for half an hour. The UV-visible\nphotoconductive responsivity of the detectors was investi-\ngated by exposing the devices to monochromatic light. UV\nillumination was supplied with a deuterium lamp\ns180\u2013350 nmd and visible light illumination was provided\nusing a Xe arc lamp s350\u2013700 nmd. The photocurrent was\nmeasured using a Keithley 237 source\/measurement unit.\nThe incident optical power spectrum was measured using a\nprecalibrated UV-enhanced silicon photodiode.\nThe photoresponsivity of the diamond UV photodetec-\ntors against the wavelength of the incident light is shown in\nFig. 1. Interestingly, the detectors that were subjected to the\nroom-temperature plasma posttreatment show a sharp in-\ncreased response in the UV region peaking at 225 nm, which\ncorresponds to the diamond band-to-band transition, giving\nrise to nearly four orders of magnitude higher response than\nthat seen in the visible region.\nadElectronic mail: s.wang@surrey.ac.uk\nFIG. 1.

A 20 mW violet semicon-\nductor laser sl=405\u00b13 nmd was used as an excitation\nsource. Two PL bands centered at 738 nm s1.68 eVd and\n532 nm s2.33 eVd were observed from the untreated sample,\nsee Fig. 2sad. In the plasma posttreated sample the peak at\n532 nm s2.33 eVd disappeared and only one PL band cen-\ntered at 738 nm s1.68 eVd was detected, as shown in Fig.\n2sbd. The presence of sp2-bonded carbon phases is believed\nto be responsible for the band centered at 532 nm s2.33 eVd.4\nThe results presented in Fig. 2sbd suggest that the plasma\nposttreatment causes etching of the sp2-bonded carbon impu-\nrities in the diamond. The PL band centered at 738 nm\ns1.68 eVd is attributed to a silicon-vacancy defect complex\nsSi\u2013Vd.5 The unintentional incorporation of the extrinsic sili-\ncon in our diamond film is assumed to result mainly from the\ninterface diffusion of silicon atoms during nucleation and\ngrowth from the silicon substrate. In Fig. 2sbd, one can ob-\nserve that the intensity of the silicon-vacancy complex line\ndecreases after plasma treatment. It was not possible to de-\ntermine the absolute concentration of impurities and defects\nin the samples from the PL spectra. In order to examine the\ndistribution of impurities or defect centers, room-temperature\nPL mapping was performed for the samples before and after\nposttreatment. Figure 3 shows the PL mapping images ob-\ntained using the same violet laser. The 50350 pixels corre-\nspond to a mapping area of 535 mm2. Bright pixels in the\nimages mark the areas of high luminescent intensity at the\nstated wavelength. Figure 3 indicates that the luminescent\nbands both at 532 nm s2.33 eVd and 738 nm s1.68 eVd de-\ncreased dramatically after plasma posttreatment. This reveals\nthat the room-temperature plasma oxidation posttreatment\ncan remove the sp2-bonded carbon and passivate the silicon-\nvacancy defects.\nFigure 4 presents the Raman spectra of CVD diamond\nsamples before and after the room-temperature plasma treat-\nment. The Raman spectra were recorded employing a Ren-\nishaw micro-Raman spectrometer using an Ar+ laser sl\n=514.5 nmd as the excitation source. A sharp diamond line at\n1332 cm\u22121 along with a weak broad amorphous carbon peak\nat around 1550 cm\u22121 was detected in the sample before\nplasma treatment. No features of sp2-bonded carbon phases\nbut only a sharp diamond line at 1332 cm\u22121 were detected in\nthe plasma posttreated sample. However, the background of\nthe Raman spectrum decreased dramatically in the post-\ntreated sample. The full-width at half-maximum sFWHMd\nvalue of the 1332 cm\u22121 line also decreased from\n4.8 to 3.2 cm\u22121 after plasma treatment. The decrease in\nFWHM and the background is possibly caused by the re-\nmoval of the sp2-bonded carbon impurities and defect passi-\nvation in the diamond surface regions, in good agreement\nwith the PL characterization results.\nPhotoresponsivity for the band gap less than 5.5 eV\nis due either to the generation of free electrons into the con-\nduction band from deep defect centers situated in the band\ngap, or to the generation of free holes in the valence band,\nresulting from the excitation of electrons from the valence\nband to deep trapping centers. The deep levels in the dia-\nmond band gap are related to impurities and defects.

On the other hand, the impurities can also play a role in\nthe recombination of photogenerated carriers. The Raman\nspectra combined with the PL mapping results from the\nplasma-treated samples clearly indicate the decrease in\nsp2-bonded carbon impurities and silicon-vacancy defect\ncenters which is believed to reduce the subgap photore-\nsponse, and hence increase the collection efficiency in the\nband-to-band excitation, resulting in an increase of photore-\nsponsivity in the UV light region and a decrease in the vis-\nible light region. Further work is in progress to clarify the\ndetailed mechanism.\nIn conclusion, CVD diamond UV photodetectors were\ncharacterized by their UV photoresponsivity. The posttreat-\nment process in the plasma of oxygen and carbon tetrafluo-\nride at room temperature described here, was found to be a\nvery effective way of eliminating the sp2-bonded carbon im-\npurities and passivating the silicon-vacancy defects. This re-\nsulted in removing the visible component of the photore-\nsponse and therefore significantly enhancing the UV\nphotoresponse of our devices.\n1P. J. Dean, E. C. Lightowlers, and D. R.
