Higher concentrations (ranging 3 \nbetween 104 and 103 CFU g-1) of E. coli persisted in soil for up to 60 days beyond the point where 4 \ncattle were removed from the plots, but these eventually declined in the early months of spring to 5 \nconcentrations less than 102 CFU g-1. The decline reflects the combined effect of cell depletion from the 6 \nsoil store through both wash-out and die-off of E. coli. No difference (P \u2265 0.05) was observed in E. coli 7 \nloads exported from drained and undrained plots. Similarly, no difference (P \u2265 0.05) was observed in 8 \nE. coli concentrations in drainage waters of mole drain flow and overland plus subsurface interflow. 9 \nIntermittent periods of elevated discharge associated with storm events mobilised E. coli at higher 10 \nconcentrations (e.g. in excess of 400 CFU ml-1) than observed during low flow conditions (often <25 11 \nCFU ml-1). The combination of high discharge and cell concentrations resulted in the export of E. coli 12 \nloads from drained and undrained plots exceeding 106 CFU L-1 s-1. The results highlight the potential 13 \nfor drained land to export E. coli loads comparable to those transferred from undrained pasture. 14 \n 15 \nKeywords: agriculture; faecal bacteria; Escherichia coli; transfer; hydrological pathways; 16 \ndrainflow 17 \n 18 \nINTRODUCTION 19 \nFaecal bacterial loading of surface waters can occur when runoff from agricultural land is 20 \ncoincident with land application of livestock wastes such as manures, slurries (liquid mix of 21 \nexcreta and urine produced by housed livestock) and excreta deposited by grazing animals 22 \n(Aitken 2003; Rodgers et al. 2003; Patni et al. 1984; McDonald et al. 1982). The detection of 23 \nfaecal indicator organisms (FIO\u2019s), such as Escherichia coli, in surface waters is indicative of 24 \nfaecal pollution and we can use these bacteria as \u2018microbial trackers\u2019 to map potential 25 \npathogen delivery to water via surface and subsurface flows from agricultural land. The 26 \nprevalence and proportions of FIO\u2019s exceed those of pathogenic strains but both are 27 \nderivatives of livestock waste. Thus, using generic E. coli as a FIO is advantageous because 28 \nconcentrations of pathogenic E. coli may drop below limits of detection upon dilution in 29 \n 3\nreceiving waters more readily than indicator organisms, but still be present in high enough 1 \nnumbers to severely debilitate vulnerable hosts upon ingestion (Gerba 1996). For example, 2 \nfewer than 30 cells of E. coli serotype 0157 are thought to cause illness in humans (Strachan 3 \net al. 2002). The relative contribution of different transfer pathways which link the land store 4 \nof faecally-derived bacteria to receiving waters and which provide hydrological connectivity 5 \nduring periods of high rainfall requires investigation at the field scale (Oliver et al., 2003; in 6 \npress). Understanding faecal bacteria persistence in soil after grazing and the subsequent 7 \ntransfer from land to water is important both in terms of minimising the risk to public health 8 \nand in developing and improving management strategies to achieve compliance with 9 \nlegislation designed to safeguard water quality such as the EU Water Framework Directive 10 \n(Anon, 2000). 11 \n 12 \nEvans and Owens (1972) assessed E. coli concentrations in drainage water from a 0.7 ha 13 \npasture following grazing combined with pig slurry application. However, the authors made 14 \nno comparison of the different transfer pathways. Faecal bacteria concentrations have been 15 \nmeasured in tile drain flow at the field scale (Scott et al., 1998) and in overland flow under 16 \nboth laboratory conditions (Quinton et al. 2003) and in the field under natural conditions (e.g. 17 \nPatni et al., 1985; Hunter et al., 1992). More recently, Abu-Ashour and Lee (2000) examined 18 \nE. coli transport on sloping soils by runoff action using 10 x 10 m plots. They concluded that 19 \nrunoff was a dominant carrier of bacterial cells.  20 \n 21 \nA series of field experiments in Scotland has detailed E. coli emergence in drainage water 22 \nfollowing cattle slurry applications to 600-m2 plots and made comparisons between cell 23 \nconcentrations exported in both drained pathways and those carried by surface runoff (Vinten 24 \net al. 2002; Fenlon et al. 2000) and this marks an important move towards quantifying the 25 \nrelative contributions of different flow pathways. However, a simultaneous study of the 26 \nrelative contribution of different hydrological pathways exporting faecal bacteria on large 27 \nplots (1 ha size) has not been reported. Furthermore, a gap in current understanding exists in 28 \n 4\nterms of upscaling experiments to enable realistic routes of FIO transfer to be predicted in the 1 \nfield. 2 \n 3 \nThe aim of this study was to establish whether E. coli deposited via excreta from grazing 4 \nsteers could be transmitted to receiving waters from poorly drained pasture in undrained 5 \n(near-surface flow to 30-cm depth) or drained (artificial drainage to 85-cm depth) conditions. 6 \nA key objective was to determine E. coli loads transferred via different hydrological pathways 7 \nand thus identify whether drained or undrained pastoral land had the potential to export more 8 \nbacteria. It was hypothesised that during baseflow conditions, both drainage treatments would 9 \nexport reduced cell concentrations (and as a result reduced loads) in contrast to storm events. 10 \nStorm runoff was proposed as the main driver of FIO losses from agricultural land, during 11 \nwhich near-surface and drained hydrological pathways were expected to export high E. coli 12 \nloads to streams. To meet these objectives, temporal changes in E. coli concentrations and 13 \nwater discharge emerging from replicated drained and undrained 1-ha hydrologically-isolated 14 \nplots were monitored after a summer grazing season. E. coli was chosen as it is the most 15 \nspecific micro-organism used to confirm faecal contamination (Mendoza et al., 2004) and is 16 \neasily enumerated.  17 \n 18 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 19 \n 20 \n1. Experimental site 21 \nThe work reported here used the Rowden Experimental Research Platform (UK National Grid 22 \nReference (NGR): SX 650 995) described in detail by Armstrong and Garwood (1991). The 23 \nsoil at the experimental site is classified as a clayey non-calcereous pelostagnogley (Avery, 24 \n1980), a typic Haplaquept (USDA Soil Conservation Service, 1975) of the Hallsworth Series 25 \n(UK Soil Survey, Harrod, 1981). The site was established in 1982 on old, unimproved pasture 26 \non slowly permeable sloping land (5-10%) (Scholefield et al., 1993). A total of eight 1-ha 27 \nhillslope lysimeters were used: four plots with artificial drainage and four plots without. 28 \n 5\nDetails of the flow pathways can be found in Haygarth et al. (1998). Briefly, flow monitoring 1 \non the undrained plots amalgamates all overland plus subsurface interflow (OSF) to a depth of 2 \n30 cm. The OSF is collected in gravel filled ditches installed at 30-cm depth at the lower plot 3 \nboundary. Artificial drains provide the drained plots with a secondary discharge route via 4 \nmole and tile drain flow (MTF), in addition to the OSF pathway that is found in undrained 5 \nplots. The OSF pathway is less important on drained plots as most water is re-routed through 6 \nthe mole and tile drains at 40- and 85-cm depth, respectively. Deep interceptor drains were 7 \ninstalled on all plots at downslope boundaries with gravel backfill to the surface and similar 8 \ndrains were installed to divert extraneous water at upslope boundaries (Scholefield, 1993) 9 \nthus isolating, hydrologically, each plot, except for deep seepage which is negligible due to 10 \nthe impermeable clay layer at 30-cm depth (Armstrong and Garwood, 1991). None of the 11 \nplots had been grazed for over a year prior to the experiments during the UK outbreak of Foot 12 \nand Mouth Disease in 2001.  13 \n 14 \n2. Sampling procedures 15 \nAll water samples were collected from October 2002 through to March 2003 in sterile 16 \npolyethylene 500-ml bottles. Each of the four replicate drained and undrained plots had been 17 \ngrazed for 6 months (May \u2013 Oct 2002) with four steers ha-1. A two-tiered approach was used, 18 \nwhereby a manual systematic weekly baseline sampling programme complemented a manual 19 \nplus automated intensive storm runoff sampling procedure. The weekly systematic baseline 20 \nsample included a series of three grab samples through the course of the day, each separated 21 \nby at least 4-hr. This enabled an observation of diurnal fluctuations in bacteria concentrations 22 \nin addition to longer term changes in cell numbers through several months. For each manual 23 \nsample a flow measurement was taken, using a stop-watch and measuring cylinder, so that 24 \nFIO flux could be calculated. Five of the sampling days had rainfall in excess of 8-mm day-1. 25 \nSoil cores to a depth of 7-cm were randomly taken to relate E. coli numbers emerging in 26 \ndrainage waters to those determined in the upper soil matrix. Each 1 ha plot was subdivided 27 \ninto a 6 x 6 grid and 12 cores bulked from each sub-sector sampled. An automatic weather 28 \n 6\nstation provided rainfall data. Detailed instrumentation was installed for one replicate of each 1 \ndrainage treatment and included a flow rate recording device (Talman, 1983) and automated 2 \nwater sampling units (Buhler Montec 1011 Epic). Operation of all devices was controlled 3 \nusing a Campbell Scientific CR10 datalogger and wiring panel. Automated sampling was 4 \ninitiated whereby samples were collected with a designated sampling interval of 1 hr to allow 5 \ncharacterisation of flow hydrograph signatures during storm events (see also Roser et al., 6 \n2002). Turbidity, pH and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in drainage waters to test for 7 \nrelationships between E. coli and environmental variables. Turbidity readings for water 8 \nsamples were obtained via a Hanna LP 2000 bench turbidity meter. Water pH was recorded 9 \nusing a pH microprobe with a silver\/silver chloride reference electrode and measurements 10 \nread from a Jenway 3320 pH meter. Total phosphorus was measured using a persulphate 11 \ndigestion method and the absorbance of the sample measured at 880 nm following addition of 12 \nan acid-antimony-molybdate reagent. 13 \n 14 \n3. Microbiological analysis 15 \n 16 \nAll samples were dealt with within 4 hours of collection. Fresh soil samples were crumbled 17 \nand 10-g was added to 90-ml sterile water prior to mixing for 40-min on a rotary agitator. The 18 \nresulting soil suspensions, and water samples, were serially diluted in sterile water then 19 \nspread-plated onto MacConkey agar and incubated at 37oC for 24-hr. Those colonies 20 \ncharacteristic of E. coli growing on MacConkey agar were enumerated, and seven random 21 \nisolates were used to confirm their identity using both BIOLOG microplate test panels and 22 \nAPI\u00ae 20E biochemical identification kits. Both these procedures rely on the biochemical 23 \nprofiles exhibited by the test isolates for confirmation of their identity through database 24 \ncomparison. 25 \n 26 \n4. Statistical analysis 27 \nMicrobial data was log transformed and then all statistical analysis performed on these values. 28 \nComparison of soil data was made using two-tailed t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). 29 \n 7\nPearson\u2019s product-moment correlation coefficients were derived to assess the association 1 \nbetween biological and environmental variables such as turbidity, pH and TP. The 2 \nhydrological patterns of E. coli emergence in the drainage treatments were compared using 3 \nANOVA. When assessing diurnal fluctuations (i.e. when sampling more than once during the 4 \nday of sampling), a split plot design was used. The use of a split plot in time (repeated 5 \nmeasures) ANOVA allowed for comparison of diurnal variations in addition to differences 6 \nbetween drainage treatments. To account for the correlation between repeated measures 7 \nwhere, theoretically, the correlation should be zero, a correctional factor (Greenhouse-Geisser 8 \nepsilon) was derived to scale down the degrees of freedom. A split plot type ANOVA using 9 \nResidual Maximum Likelihood (REML) was required in cases where there were missing data 10 \npoints. In all cases, Genstat 7.1 for Windows (VSN International, 2003) was used as the 11 \nstatistical package. 12 \n 13 \nRESULTS 14 \n1. E. coli in soil 15 \nThe soil data in Figure 1 suggest that introduced E. coli is able to persist in the soil for several 16 \nmonths following the removal of cattle. However, there is a steady decline in cell numbers 17 \nover time. No significant difference (P \u2265 0.05) was observed in E. coli decline for drained and 18 \nundrained treatments. By February, E. coli numbers were below the limit of detection (5 x 102 19 \nCFU g-1 dry soil). The results shown in Figure 1 suggest that the E. coli detected in soil was 20 \nsourced from grazing cattle because it was not detected in high numbers in the ungrazed 21 \ncontrol plot throughout the experiment in contrast to the grazed plots where E. coli 22 \nconcentrations were significantly higher (P \u2264 0.05).  23 \n 24 \n2. Drainage results  25 \nTable 1 A-D summarizes the relationships between biological and environmental variables for 26 \ntwo periods (1) October to December 2002 (Table 1A and 1B) and (2) October 2002 through 27 \nto March 2003 (Table 1C and 1D). Two periods are shown to indicate the effect of time since 28 \n 8\nremoval of the E. coli reservoir on the strength of the relationships shown. The results for the 1 \nOSF pathway on the drained plot are not included in correlation analysis because flow in this 2 \npathway occurred on a few occasions only, hence data points were limited.  3 \n 4 \n(1) October to December 2002: Table 1A and 1B show the strength and significance of 5 \nassociations between bacteria concentrations and water quality variables within the undrained 6 \nOSF pathway and MTF pathway, respectively. A strong relationship is shown between E. coli 7 \nand total MacConkey bacterial colonies and E. coli and flow. However, the correlation 8 \ncoefficient of 0.739 between E. coli and flow for the MTF pathway (P \u2264 0.001) is stronger 9 \nthan the association between these 2 variables within the undrained OSF pathway (r = 0.568; 10 \nP \u2264 0.001). There is a significant (P \u2264 0.001) positive correlation between turbidity and E. 11 \ncoli (OSF: r = 0.615; MTF: r = 0.674). A strong relationship exists between total MacConkey 12 \ncolonies and both flow and TP.   13 \n 14 \n(2) October 2002 to March 2003: examination of the relationships between biological and 15 \nenvironmental variables through to March 2003 indicated that the strength of some of the 16 \nrelationships declined with time since the removal of cattle. Within both drainage treatments, 17 \ncorrelation coefficients between E. coli and all other variables declined. This is most 18 \nnoticeable with the association between E. coli and turbidity, where a nonsignificant (P \u2265 19 \n0.05) relationship is now observed in the MTF pathway. The association between total 20 \nMacConkey colonies and turbidity within both transfer pathways also declines in strength, 21 \nthough remaining at the same level of statistical significance.  22 \n 23 \n3. Rainfall and flow relationships  24 \nInstantaneous loads (discharge x cell concentration) were calculated for the three hydrological 25 \npathways. The load exported from drained plots was determined from sum of the load 26 \nexported via both the OSF and MTF pathway whereas the load transferred from undrained 27 \nplots was calculated for a single export pathway (OSF). The relationship between daily 28 \n 9\nrainfall and E. coli loads exported from both drained and undrained plots is shown in Figure 1 \n2. Escherichia coli loads in excess of 104 CFU ml-1s-1 were frequent in the first six weeks after 2 \nthe removal of cattle. The greatest flux of E. coli from drained and undrained pasture were 3 \ncoincident with high rainfall. No significant differences (P \u2265 0.05) in E. coli loads were 4 \nidentified between drainage treatments. The first storm event sampled on day 24 exported 5 \naverage instantaneous loads of 1.25 x 106 and 1.05 x 106 CFU L-1 s-1 from drained and 6 \nundrained plots, respectively. Instantaneous E. coli loads transferred during the second storm 7 \nevent (day 38) averaged 1.15 x 106 CFU L-1s-1 for drained and 5.51 x 105 CFU L-1s-1 for 8 \nundrained plots. The undrained OSF pathway exported higher concentrations of E. coli than 9 \nthe MTF pathway on the majority of sample dates, though the differences in concentrations 10 \nwere also nonsignificant (p \u2265 0.05). Concentrations of E. coli in drainage discharge had 11 \ndeclined by the end of December (see Figure 3). However, fluxes of 1.2 x 104 and 5.6 x 103 12 \nCFU L-1 s-1 were recorded as late as day 102 for undrained and drained plots, respectively.  13 \n 14 \nThe storm event on day 24 increased the average instantaneous E. coli load exported from 15 \ndrained and undrained plots by over 100- and 40-fold, respectively, relative to baseflow loads 16 \n24 hours previous. The second storm event on day 38, relative to the baseline sample 17 \ncollected the previous day, saw E. coli loads exported from drained and undrained plots 18 \nincrease by a factor in excess of 6 x 105 and 5 x 104, respectively. Diurnal fluctuations in the 19 \nloads of E. coli exported in hydrological pathways correlated with fluctuations in discharge. 20 \nFor example, on day 24, a significant increase (P \u2264 0.001) in the diurnal load of E. coli 21 \ncorresponded with a significant increase (P \u2264 0.001) in flow. On day 38 a diurnal decline in 22 \ncell load (P \u2264 0.001) was accompanied by a decline in discharge (P \u2264 0.001).  23 \n 24 \n4. Time-series data 25 \nFigure 3A (MTF pathway) and 3B (undrained OSF pathway) show the concentration of E. 26 \ncoli in discharge from the continuously flowing pathways over time. Flow and E. coli 27 \nconcentration are positively correlated (Table 1). There is a marked decline in cell numbers 28 \n 10\nwith time for both near-surface and drained pathways. A storm event on 28 Feb 2003 1 \ngenerated discharge of 2-L s-1 and 2.7-L s-1 for the drained and undrained plot, respectively; 2 \nthe associated E. coli concentrations were 50 CFU ml-1 via MTF and 17 CFU ml-1 via 3 \nundrained OSF. For the drained plot, it is interesting that samples collected at the beginning 4 \nof December 2002 (Figure 3A: point X) experienced flow rates of approximately half that 5 \nrecorded at the end of February 2003, and yet the cell concentration exported was nearly five 6 \ntimes higher at 236 CFU ml-1, in December. Similarly, for the undrained OSF pathway, the 7 \nDecember 2002 flow (Figure 3B: point X) was nearly a third of that at the end of February 8 \n2003, yet E. coli concentrations of 150 CFU ml-1 were recorded. 9 \n 10 \nFigure 5 presents time-series data for a single storm event (27 Nov 2002) for E. coli 11 \nconcentration, turbidity and flow within MTF. A sample resolution of 1-hr was used during 12 \nthe hydrograph to evaluate the pattern of E. coli emergence. The peak in cell numbers was 13 \nobserved approximately 2-hr after peak discharge. A peak in turbidity is shown prior to both 14 \nthe discharge and microbial peaks.  15 \n 16 \nDISCUSSION 17 \nThe transfer of faecal bacteria to surface waters occurs as a function of both organism 18 \nsurvival in both soil and drainage water, and transfer via different hydrological pathways. The 19 \ndecline in abundance of E. coli in soil, shown in Figure 1, was anticipated because the surface 20 \nsource of cells was no longer replenished by supplies from cattle after their removal in 21 \nOctober 2002. The ability of E. coli to persist for periods of several months highlights the 22 \npotential for contamination of the surrounding environment and has been noted previously by 23 \nEvans and Owens (1972) who concluded that E. coli isolated from drain discharge survived in 24 \nor on pasture for at least 4 months. In this study we found that drainage status had no impact 25 \non the decline of E. coli numbers in soil. However, the data are not a true reflection of die-off 26 \nunder different treatment conditions, but are instead the resultant E. coli population following 27 \nwater flux through and over the soil. It is possible that high discharges, at this scale, are the 28 \n 11\ndominant factor dictating the observed decline in cell numbers in soil. The research reported 1 \nhere focused on cell concentrations in the upper 7-cm of soil, but cells may have also become 2 \ntrapped in soil pores through processes of straining, attachment and sedimentation (Abu-3 \nAshour et al., 1994) within deeper sections of the profile, been caught up in blocked pores 4 \n(Kim and Corapcioglu 2002) below 7-cm depth or may have entered a viable but non-5 \nculturable (VBNC) state. The low concentrations of E. coli detected in October, November 6 \nand December within ungrazed plots may represent E. coli indigenous to the soil, or possibly 7 \nbe derived from wild animal faeces (Wasteson et al., 1999) or be a function of surface runoff 8 \nfrom adjacent fields during a period associated with high rainfall (e.g. Abu-Ashour and Lee, 9 \n2000).  10 \n 11 \nThe lack of significant differences in E. coli loads exported from drained and undrained 12 \npasture suggests faecal bacteria, deposited on grasslands by grazing cattle, may be transferred 13 \nvia different pathways under varying drainage conditions. For example, the installation of 14 \nmole and tile drains, primarily to lower the soil water table, may be seen as advantageous in 15 \nlimiting the load of potential pollutants transferred rapidly via surface runoff or near-surface 16 \nflow pathways. However, the pattern of E. coli concentrations and loads from drained and 17 \nundrained plots demonstrates that cells may transfer through the soil profile, perhaps via 18 \nfissures and preferential pathways, to reach the mole and tile drains. So although drainage 19 \nmay potentially reduce surface runoff and minimise \u2018wash-off\u2019 of surface dwelling cells it 20 \nmay also re-route faecal bacteria through subsurface pathways. As noted by Smith et al. 21 \n(1985), sufficient input of rainfall to a soil may initiate water flow in larger pores and create 22 \nthe potential for suspended bacteria to transfer rapidly through the profile of well structured 23 \nsoils. Other studies have observed the rapid transfer of bacteria via preferential flow pathways 24 \nat the laboratory scale (e.g. Aislabie et al., 2001; Abu Ashour et al., 1998); this pathway may 25 \nbe important in carrying cells into the tile drain pathway of this study. Hunter et al. (1999) 26 \ncomment that better drained land is non-conducive for faecal bacterial survival and that 27 \ntransport opportunities are reduced for these bacteria. However, the present data suggest that 28 \n 12\nunder given rainfall conditions, E. coli loads comparable with those exported from poorly 1 \ndrained fields can be transferred from well drained plots and emerge via subsurface routes. 2 \nFurthermore, the data presented in Figures 2 and 3 suggest that subsurface flow is a key driver 3 \nof E. coli transfer from soil to water. These findings are similar to those of Vinten et al. 4 \n(2002) who recorded high E. coli concentrations in drainage water following slurry 5 \napplication in association with periods of high rainfall and drain flow.  6 \n 7 \nThe large percentage increase in E. coli loads detected in the high flow conditions, linked to 8 \nhigh rainfall, is evidence that discharge through pathways dictates E. coli emergence. A 9 \npossible explanation is that increased water flux at the soil surface is required to release cells 10 \nfrom the source material and drive their movement from land to water. Low rainfall (< 5-mm 11 \nday-1), as seen in Figure 2, is insufficient to transfer E. coli loads at such high magnitudes as 12 \nobserved during storm events. High loads were exported from undrained plots 102 days after 13 \nthe removal of cattle despite the relatively low cell concentrations detected in drainage water 14 \nwhen compared with the two storm events in November. However, the recorded discharge of 15 \nwater was sufficiently high to transfer an E. coli load comparable to that exported within 30 16 \ndays of the cattle being removed from pasture. This again highlights the importance of flow 17 \nvolume in the export of high cell loads even after previous depletion of E. coli in soil through 18 \nwashout and cell death. 19 \n 20 \nRelationships between E. coli and turbidity in water have been cited in the literature within 21 \nriver flow under flood conditions (Nagels et al. 2002) where positive associations between the 22 \n2 variables were noted, and within leachates (Gagliardi and Karns, 2000) where a negative 23 \ncorrelation was observed. This field study recorded a positive correlation between E. coli and 24 \nturbidity. This apparent relationship suggests a potential association of E. coli with soil 25 \ncolloids and particles that are dispersed during energetic flows, though the proportions of cells 26 \nwhich are freely suspended or attached is unknown. This association with E. coli and flow 27 \nsuggests that some cells may behave similar to particulate contaminants such as colloidal P 28 \n 13\nand sediment (Heathwaite et al., in press). Tyrell and Quinton (2003) acknowledged that 1 \nmany authors assume that microbes behave like soil particles. Thus we can conclude that E. 2 \ncoli is physically mobilised by water; and not diluted by the increased discharge volume in a 3 \nsimilar manner to nitrate. When calculating correlation coefficients for the data extending 4 \nthrough to March it becomes clear that there is a decline of E. coli in the plots through wash 5 \nout and cell death. This suggests that E. coli in the experiment is derived from the excreta 6 \ndeposited onto the soil during the grazing season of the same year and is not a legacy of 7 \nprevious year\u2019s grazing.  8 \n 9 \nDuring the storm event (Figure 5), the peak in turbidity breakthrough occurs prior to E. coli, 10 \nand in-turn this occurs prior to flow, suggesting that soil particles and colloids are mobilised 11 \nbefore bacterial cells. This may be because soil lines the transfer pathways through the soil 12 \nprofile, and it is possible that soil particulates are removed much more rapidly than surface 13 \ndwelling cells located within the micro-habitat of excreta and once removed, they free the 14 \npathways for the movement of cells. It is therefore proposed that cells lag behind flow 15 \nbecause they need to be first mobilised from their protected location within the waste source 16 \nat the soil surface. Vinten et al. (2002) note that E. coli transport to drains is likely to be more 17 \nprevalent when the waste material (in their case slurry) remains at the soil surface rather than 18 \nbeing transferred down into the soil profile during light rain. This complements the findings 19 \nof our study, whereby faecal deposits remained at the soil surface during the post-grazing 20 \nperiod and provided a source of high E. coli flux through drains during storm events.  21 \n 22 \nCONCLUSIONS 23 \nRainfall events, by triggering surface and subsurface runoff from grassland soils may 24 \nsignificantly impact the bacteriological quality of drainage waters following a typical grazing 25 \nseason in the U.K. This is largely because E. coli is able to persist in soil at high 26 \nconcentrations extending into autumn and months typically associated with rainfall. Artificial 27 \ndrainage, which can reduce overland flow and potentially minimise wash-off of livestock 28 \n 14\nexcreta derived contaminants from the soil surface, has the potential to enhance E. coli export 1 \nvia subsurface routes during periods of high discharge. Thus, in terms of minimising the risk 2 \nof E. coli transfer from pasture to receiving waters, the installation of drainage does not 3 \nnecessarily offer improved protection from faecal bacteria inputs. Determining those areas of 4 \ngrazed pasture considered to be vulnerable to bacterial transfer should prove effective in 5 \nreducing coliform loading of receiving waters. For example, the removal of cattle from steep 6 \nslopes and areas prone to overland flow may limit rapid bacterial transfer during strom events. 7 \nHowever, the high loads exported via artificial drainage pathways suggests that management 8 \noptions such as riparian buffers may have limited impact on reducing E. coli transfer from 9 \ndrained pasture. 10 \n 11 \n 12 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 13 \nWe thank Dr. Brajesh Singh at MLURI, Aberdeen, for BIOLOG results, Claire Brannon at 14 \nExeter University for API results and Dan Dhanoa for statistical advice.
