INTRODUCTION \n \nAn employment practice which has a disproportionate impact on women and cannot \nbe \u2018justified\u2019 amounts to indirect sex discrimination under s 1(1)(b), Sex \nDiscrimination Act 1975 (SDA). It may also be unlawful under European Community \nlaw, in particular A 141 (equal pay) and the Equal Treatment Directive (76\/207). The \nsame formula is used to define indirect racial discrimination in s 1(1)(b), Race \nRelations Act 1976 (RRA). In Allonby v Accrington & Rossendale College the Court \nof Appeal scrutinised the meaning of \u2018justified\u2019 under the SDA. This is important for \nemployers because the precise definition dictates how onerous their burden is to \njustify a challenged employment practice. This case concerned in particular \njustification where (i) less-discriminatory alternative measures existed to achieve the \nsame goal and (ii) the employer's defence itself was based on discrimination. \n \nAccrington & Rossendale College employed 341 part-time lecturers on successive \none-year contracts. In 1996 legislation came into force obliging the College to afford \nto their part-time lecturers equal benefits to those given to their full-time lecturers. \n(Although not specified by the EAT or the CA this was presumably the Employment \nProtection (Part-Time Employees) Regulations 1995, passed in response to R v Sec of \nState for Employment, ex p EOC [1994] 1 All ER 910, where the House of Lords held \nthat existing legislation prescribing inferior rights to part-time workers was \nincompatible with superior Community sex discrimination law.) Faced with the extra \nexpense the College responded by terminating the contracts with all its part-time \nlecturers and re-employing them as sub-contractors, through an agency. As a \nconsequence the part-timers were paid less and lost a series of benefits (eg sick pay). \nMs Allonby, a part-time lecturer, brought several actions against the College. One \nwas for indirect sex discrimination. \n \nIn the employment tribunal Ms Allonby proved her prima facie case that the new \narrangement had caused a disparate impact on women, who made up some two-thirds \nof the part-time lecturers, but only about half of the full-timers. And so the dismissals \nfell disproportionately upon women. However the tribunal found that the new \narrangement was justified for two reasons. First, to save money, estimated at about \n\u00a313,000 per year. Second, to impose control over the hiring of part-time staff, which \nhad in the past been left to individual team leaders. The tribunal also noted that \u2018any \ndecision taken for sound business reasons would inevitably affect one group more \nthan another group.\u2019 The Employment Appeal Tribunal agreed with that decision and \nMs Allonby appealed to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the College had failed to \njustify the measures because (i) less-discriminatory alternative measures existed to \nachieve the College's goals, and (ii) the measures were themselves based on \ndiscrimination. \n \n \n2. THE LAW AND DECISION \n \nIn the Court of Appeal Sedley, LJ gave the leading judgement. He first alluded to the \nequal pay case Bilka Kauffhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz [1987] ICR 110, where (at \n126) the European Court of Justice held that a disparity in pay could be justified if (a) \nthe policy corresponded to a real need, and (b) was suitable to achieve the goal, and \n(c) was necessary to achieve the goal. Sedley, LJ then cited the \u2018objective balance\u2019 \ntest from Hampson v Department of Education [1989] ICR 179 (at 191): \u2018\"justifiable\" \n[from s1, SDA] requires an objective balance between the discriminatory effect of the \ncondition and the reasonable needs of the party who applies the condition.\u2019 Sedley\u2019s, \nLJ conclusion of the law was that to justify the practice the College had to \ndemonstrate a real need and show that this was not outweighed by its discriminatory \neffect upon women (at para. 29). \n \nHaving stated the law, Sedley, LJ found that the tribunal had erred in two respects. \nFirst, they did not consider any \u2018fairly obvious\u2019 alternative measures short of \ndismissal to save money and gain control over the hiring of part-time staff. The \nsecond (and 'major') error was that the tribunal, by accepting that any arrangement \nwould inevitably have a discriminatory effect, disabled itself from applying the \n\u2018objective balance\u2019 test, that is weighing the effect of the measure against the \nCollege\u2019s needs. Accordingly the case was remitted to the employment tribunal for \nreconsideration. \n \n3. ANALYSIS \n \nA. Bilka and Hampson reconciled \nSedley\u2019s, LJ reconciliation of Bilka and Hampson could be interpreted in two ways. \nFirst, that Bilka and Hampson were two stages of a compound definition of \njustification. We decide first if there was a \u2018real need\u2019 (Bilka) and second, if its \ndiscriminatory effect outweighed the College\u2019s needs (Hampson). This is an unlikely \ninterpretation though. Sedley, LJ quoted Lord Nicholls in Barry v Midland Bank \n[1999] ICR 859 HL, (at 870): \u2018The more serious the disparate impact on women...the \nmore cogent must be the objective justification.\u2019 This said Sedley, LJ, \u2018amplified\u2019 the \nHampson test. Although Sedley, LJ failed to mention that Lord Nicholls was \ndiscussing the Community Law principle of proportionality (Hampson was not cited \nin Barry), we must assume that, Sedley, LJ (and Lord Nicholls) was equating the \nHampson 'objective balance' test with the principle of proportionality. This \nundermines the theory that Sedley, LJ was crafting a two-stage test. This is because \nthe principle of proportionality is inherent in the Bilka test, which demands that a \nmeasure must be \u2018suitable\u2019 and \u2018necessary\u2019 to achieve the goal. Proportionality, or \nHampson, cannot work as a separate test. An employer who has shown that a practice \nwas suitable and necessary, has at the same time shown that it was proportionate. It \nwould be absurd to ask again, was it suitable and necessary?  And in cases where an \nemployer had failed to show that a practice was suitable and necessary, a separate \nquestion of proportionality would be pointless. \n \nSo we must accept the second interpretation, that Hampson merely reflects parts (b) \nand (c) of the Bilka test. This is the neatest integration yet of the Bilka and Hampson \n\u2018tests\u2019. Hitherto, British courts have done no more than treat the tests as expressing \nthe same thing in different language. (See for instance Balcombe, LJ in Hampson, \nwho (at 34) traced his \u2018objective balance\u2019 test to Bilka via the decision in Rainey v \nGreater Glasgow Health Bd [1987] AC 224 HL; the House of Lords approved this in \nWebb v EMO [1992] 4 All ER 929, at 936.) \n \n \nB. Alternative Measures \n \nHowever, Sedley's, LJ assimilation of Bilka - or more precisely proportionality - and \nHampson is not perfect. The obvious difference is in the language. The word \n'necessary' appears nowhere in the Hampson test. But there is a difference in \nsubstance as well. Asking if a practice is suitable and necessary is different from \nasking whether it is outweighed by its discriminatory effect. This becomes clear \nwhere, as Ms Allonby argued, there exists an alternative. Under Hampson the \nexistence of a less-discriminatory alternative practice achieving the same goal is \nmerely an ingredient in the 'balance' test; under Bilka it will always defeat a \njustification defence. The case of Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority [1994] 1 All \nER 495 illustrates the point. \nIn Enderby the Health Authority was trying to justify a difference in pay between \nspeech therapists (98 per cent female) and pharmacists (63 per cent female). The \npharmacists were paid about 40 per cent more than the speech therapists. As women \nwere over-represented in the lower paid group the Health Authority were obliged to \njustify the difference. It argued that market forces caused the difference. But the \nevidence was that only an extra ten per cent pay was needed to recruit a sufficient \nnumber of pharmacists. Thus there existed a less-discriminatory alternative of paying \nthe pharmacists a ten per cent premium. The ECJ held (at para 27): 'If...the National \nCourt has been able to determine precisely what proportion of the increase in pay is \nattributable to market forces, it must necessarily accept that that the pay differential is \nobjectively justified to the extent of that proportion.' In other words, proportionality \nmeans no more than necessary. \nIf we applied the Hampson 'objective balance' test to the facts of Enderby the result \nmay be different. On the one hand there is the 40 per cent difference in pay, on the \nother, the need for sufficient pharmacists. Given that stark choice, a tribunal could \neasily hold that the difference in pay was justified. Indeed that was the result in the \nEAT in Enderby [1991] ICR 382. \nCase law history also demonstrates that the British judiciary understood that there was \na lower standard of justification than Bilka. In the early years of the British \nlegislation, tribunals (influenced by US case law, upon which our legislation was \nbased), spoke of \u2018necessity\u2019. For example, in Steel v Union of Post Office Workers \n[1978] ICR 181, Phillips, J, President of the EAT, said, (at 187) that the practice must \nbe inter alia \u2018genuine and necessary\u2019. \nIn 1982, however, the Court of Appeal in Ojutiku v Manpower Services Commission \n[1982] ICR 661 contrasted the word 'necessary' with the statutory word 'justified'; \nKerr, LJ stated (at 670) that \u2018justifiable...clearly applies a lower standard \nthan...necessary\u2019. Eveleigh, LJ considered (at 668) it to mean \u2018something...acceptable \nto right-thinking people as sound and tolerable.\u2019 Balcombe, LJ in Hampson retrieved \nthe situation somewhat with his \u2018objective justification\u2019 test. However, he did not \nrestore the standard to the pre-Ojutiku position. Otherwise he would have simply used \nthe word \u2018necessary\u2019. Obvious support for a lower standard lies in the legislative \nhistory. The RRA and SDA use the term \u2018justified\u2019 rather than 'necessary'. In \nParliament, the Government resisted amendments to the Sex Discrimination Bill that \nwould have replaced 'justifiable' with 'necessary'. Lord Harris stated that where a body \noffered reduced fares for pensioners, the policy might be justifiable, but not necessary \n(362 HL Deb 14 July 1975 cols 10116-17). \n  \nMeanwhile, the ECJ was developing its jurisprudence on indirect discrimination. The \nBilka test expressly demanded that any measure should be \u2018necessary\u2019 to achieve the \ngoal. The existence of a less-discriminatory alternative will defeat a defence of \njustification. However, under Hampson, the mere existence of a less-discriminatory \nalternative is not enough to defeat a defence. As Enderby (above) illustrates, if the \ndiscriminatory effect of the disputed measure is \u2018outweighed\u2019 by the employer\u2019s \nneeds, then the defence will succeed, no matter haw many less-discriminatory \nalternatives exist. This approach slowly permeated the British cases until the Court of \nAppeal in Hampson felt compelled to reconcile it with the British position.  \n \nA similar uncertainty has dogged American case law. In the seminal US Supreme \nCourt case Griggs v Duke Power (1971) 401 US 424, Burger, CJ stated (at 431): \u2018The \ntouchstone is business necessity. If an employment practice which operates to exclude \nNegroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\u2019 \nHowever, later he said (at 432):  'Congress has placed on the employer the burden of \nshowing that any given requirement must have a manifest relationship to the \nemployment in question.' Here we have two standards (\u2018business necessity\u2019 and \n\u2018manifest relationship\u2019) in the same speech. Subsequent Supreme Court \npronouncements have vacillated between the two, giving for instance, \u2018significant \ncorrelation\u2019 and \u2018necessary\u2019. (From respectively Albermarle Paper v Moody 1975 422 \nUS 405, at 431 and Dothard v Rawlinson 1977 433 US 321, at 331.) This uncertainty \nwas codified by the Civil Rights Act 1991, which stated that a practice must be \u2018job \nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.' (42 USCS \ns. 2000e-2, (k)(1)(A)(i)).  \n \nHowever, different standards of justification in the United States matter little where \nalternatives exist because the Supreme Court has developed a separate \u2018alternative \npractice\u2019 doctrine. A plaintiff may defeat a justification defence by proposing an \nalternative business practice which has a less (or no) discriminatory effect. The rubric \ngenerally used was set in Albermarle Paper Co v Moody (422 US 405, at 425): the \nalternative should \u2018also serve the employer's legitimate interest in \u201cefficient and \ntrustworthy workmanship.\u201d\u2019 \nNone of this is to say that British courts will refuse to consider alternatives in the \njustification debate. Sedley's, LJ judgement was not as clear-cut as that. Indeed the \nCourt of Appeal remitted Allonby's case for reconsideration because, among other \nthings, the tribunal had not considered the \u2018obvious\u2019 alternatives open to the College. \nOf course asking a tribunal to 'consider' an alternative in the 'balance' test is different \nfrom ruling that the mere existence of an alternative will defeat the justification \ndefence. Sedley's, LJ judgement further departs from Bilka with his attendant \ncomments. He noted (at para. 28) that the tribunal had failed \u2018to evaluate...whether the \ndismissals were reasonably necessary - a test which, while of course not demanding \nindispensability, requires proof of a real need\u2019. Here Sedley, LJ has diluted Bilka by \nqualifying \u2018necessary\u2019 with \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 and not indispensable. He spoke \nonly of obvious alternatives. This is the language of compromise. One can only \nconclude that he intended a broad-brush approach. Tribunals should only consider \n\u2018fairly obvious\u2019 alternatives. This deepens the impression (eg given in Ojutiku and \nHampson) that the English courts will apply Bilka in form only, whilst actually \nsubjecting employers to the lower Hampson standard of justification. \n \nFinally, this does not mean that the difference between Hampson and Bilka is merely \na matter of degree. It is a fundamental difference. The compromise in the Hampson \ntest upsets the theory of indirect discrimination. Where a practice having a disparate \nimpact is shown to be absolutely necessary to achieve a genuine non-discriminatory \ngoal, then the cause of the disparate impact lies elsewhere. No action lies against the \nemployer. The cause(s) of any disparate impact can only be identified if the courts \nimpose a strict test of necessity. A lesser standard gives employers leeway to \ndiscriminate and blurs the causes of a disparate impact. As Enderby's case illustrates, \n'excess' disparate impact amounts to discrimination. Further, a strict test of necessity \nforces employers to eliminate discriminatory employment practices, which by their \nnature, are inefficiencies. The irony is that as many men as women, and far more \nwhites than non-whites, would benefit from that.  \n \n \nC. Defence Based On Sex \n \nMs Allonby's alternative argument suggested that where the measure was based on \ndiscrimination, it could never be justified. It will be recalled that the dismissals were a \nresponse to the Employment Protection (Part-Time Employees) Regulations 1995, \nwhich were passed in deference to Community sex discrimination law. One reason for \nremitting the case given by Sedley, LJ was that: \u2018In particular there is no recognition \n[by the tribunal] that if the aim of the dismissal was itself discriminatory...it could \nnever afford justification.\u2019 (At para. 29) Surprisingly, the judge said no more than that \non the issue. \n \nMs Allonby cited R v Sec of State, ex p EOC [1994] 1 All ER 910 and R v Sec of \nState, ex p Seymour-Smith [1999] All ER (EC) 97. In Ex p EOC (the case that led to \nthe Regulations) Lord Keith held (at 922) that the existing Regulations that afforded \nlesser benefits to part-time workers constituted a \u2018gross breach of the principle of \nequal pay and could not be possibly regarded as a suitable means of achieving an \nincrease in part-time employment.\u2019 In ex p Seymour-Smith the ECJ, when giving a \nruling on justification, stated (at para 75) that a Government measure \u2018cannot have the \neffect of frustrating the implementation of a fundamental principle of Community law \nsuch as that of equal pay...\u2019  \n \nThose cases concerned Government measures made in pursuance of a social policy. In \nsuch cases the ECJ allows a Government a \u2018broad margin of discretion\u2019 (see eg ex p \nSeymour-Smith at para 74), which is less onerous than the Bilka test. In Allonby the \n\u2018measure\u2019 (ie dismissals) was taken by a College employer and should be judged by \nthe stricter Bilka standard. The express aim of the measure was to give \n(predominantly female) part-time lecturers less benefits and pay. That too was a gross \nbreach of the fundamental principle of equal pay and accordingly should never be \njustified. On this point alone Ms Allonby should prevail. \n  \nThere lies a related line of argument here. Section 1(1)(b), SDA provides that the \nmeasure must be justified \u2018irrespective\u2019 of sex. According to the ECJ the measures \nmust be \u2018explained by factors which exclude any discrimination on grounds of sex.\u2019 \n(See Jenkins v Kingsgate [1981] 1 WLR 973 (at para 13) and Bilka (at para 29.) The \ndismissals were made in response to the Regulations of 1995 passed to afford equal \nbenefits to part-time workers because they are predominantly female. The reports are \nvague as to the relationship between the stated goals - to save money and control the \nhiring of part-time lecturers - and the introduction of the Regulations. In the EAT \n(EAT\/1081\/98, Transcript) Lindsay\u2019s, J sole observation was (at para. 6): \u2018The \nCollege took the view that the costs attendant upon recent changes in the law as to \npart-time workers were too high for it\u2019. In the Court of Appeal, Sedley, LJ noted only \n(at para. 3) that things had become \u2018financially more onerous because of legislative \nchanges which required part-time lecturers to be afforded equal...benefits to full-time \nlecturers.\u2019 \n \nIt can be said, at the least, the new Regulations were the background of the dismissals. \nThe question is, were the dismissals unrelated to sex? The immediate goal was to save \nmoney and gain control over hiring part-time staff. In Orphanos v Queen Mary \nCollege [1985] 2 All ER 233 the plaintiff challenged a requirement to be three-years \nordinarily resident within the European Community, so to be exempt from full \noverseas student fees. The immediate goal for the requirement was to curtail public \nexpenditure on education. The House of Lords held (at 239-230) that the requirement \nwas \u2018so closely related\u2019 to nationality that it could not be justified and amounted to \nindirect racial discrimination. In Allonby the dismissals of a predominantly female \ngroup were inspired by Regulations aimed to afford equal benefits to women. It is at \nleast arguable that the requirement is \u2018so closely related\u2019 to sex that it should not be \njustifiable. \n \n \n4. CONCLUSION \n \nThis case was remitted because the tribunal failed to apply any sort of objective test of \njustification. The tribunal's failure to consider an alternative was evidence of this and \nno more. The Court of Appeal did not recommend that the justification defence \nnecessarily should fail because there was a 'fairly obvious' alternative. This reveals \nthat the Court of Appeal did not apply the Bilka standard, only the lower Hampson \none. \n \nAllonby follows a series of cases in our senior courts (eg Hampson, Barry, Webb) \nwhere a 'balance' test has been equated with the principle of proportionality, first set \nout in Bilka. Clearly Hampson does not reflect fully the proportionality principle, \nwhich means no more than necessary. The effect of this is notable where there exists \na less-discriminatory alternative able to achieve the employer's goal. Under Bilka, the \nmere existence of one will defeat a justification defence; Enderby illustrates that. But \naccording to Allonby, only 'obvious' alternatives qualify to be balanced against the \n'reasonable' and 'not indispensable' needs of the employer. This less onerous test \nupsets the theory of indirect discrimination by sanctioning a certain amount of \ndiscrimination and blurring its cause(s). It also weakens the attack on business \ninefficiencies that benefits all.  \n \nAs the law stands, the existence of less-discriminatory alternative practice achieving \nthe same goal will, under EU legislation and in the United States, defeat a defence of \njustification. However, under domestic legislation an alternative practice is merely an \ningredient in a 'balance' test. Where the claimant can identify an alternative practice \nthey would be well advised to bring their claim under EU legislation, where possible.  \n \nEmployers are obliged to justify a disparate impact under A141, the Equal Treatment \nDirective (76\/207), the Equal Pay Act 1970, the SDA and RRA. Balcombe, LJ stated \nin Hampson (at 192) that it was 'obviously desirable that the tests of justifiability in \napplied in all these closely related fields should be consistent with each other'. Clearly \nthey are not. Yet there is no excuse for this state of affairs. British courts are not \nbound by Parliamentary debates and so can disregard the Government's apparent \nintended meaning of the word 'justified'. Parliament clearly intends that domestic law \nis consistent with EU law. The Bilka test could easily be read into the statutory term \n'justified'. This would not be straining statutory words; after all, for years the British \ncourts for years have been purporting to do this. In addition there is the doctrine of \nindirect effect (to construe, where possible, domestic statutes consistent with EU law) \nto bolster them. \n \nFinally, it was surprising that the Court of Appeal made no comment on the law cited \nto support Ms Allonby's alternative argument that a defence based on discrimination \ncould never succeed. Could this be an early sign of another long-running difference \nbetween UK and EU discrimination law? \n \n \n \nMichael Connolly \nSenior Lecturer in Law, University of Westminster \n"}
