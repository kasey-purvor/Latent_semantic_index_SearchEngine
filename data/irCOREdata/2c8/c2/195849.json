The paper discusses competing perspectives \nunderpinning the focus of the study. Recent legislation in America approving single-sex schooling \n(Hutchison Amendment in June 2001), and increased provision of single-sex classes in UK and \nelsewhere have augmented the debates around single-sex education and achievement. However, \nanother important but less explored aspect is association between single-sex education and culture\/faith \nin certain communities\/countries. In today\u201fs multi-ethnic multi-faith societies, it is highly significant to \nlook at schooling preferences from the perspectives of different groups and communities for the \npurposes of responding to their needs and expectations. This paper extends the debate by discussing the \nimpact of culture and faith on school choices with regard to single-sex versus co-educational schooling. \n \nWhy Single-Sex Schools? Discourses of culture\/faith and achievement \nBy \nSaeeda Shah, University of Leicester \n With \n Catherine Conchar, Nottingham City Children's Services \nSingle-sex education is a historical phenomenon. Traditionally, single-sex education \nhas been in the form of boys-only schools (Ivinson and Murphy, 2007) invoking \nfeminist critique in the modern and post-modern eras with regard to equal \nopportunities and female marginalisation (Deem, 1984; Weiner, 1994). In the \ntwentieth century, growth of co-educational institutions led to debates about strengths \nand weaknesses of single-sex versus co-educational schools. A variety of explanations \nhave been offered by researchers supporting competing positions, but like other \ncontending debates \u201ethe explanations have often been guesswork, prejudice or \nattempts to support particular theories\u201f (Tomlinson, 1991, p.121). There is no study \nwhich can claim to have controlled every other variable to fully investigate single-sex \nor co-education factor (Smithers and Robinson, 2006). Smithers and Robinson (2006) \noffer a detailed review of literature, quoting studies from Australia, America, Canada \nand the UK which discuss the impact of single-sex and co-educational schools, and \nseparate classrooms for boys and girls, on academic achievement, subject choice\/s \nand personal\/social development. They emphasise that the evidence is inconclusive to \nsupport the effect of single-sex provision on education or indeed educational \nachievement: \n 2 \nWithout clear general findings, deciding whether to mix or separate the sexes \nfor education has to be a matter of judgment. (Smithers and Robinson, 2006, \np.31) \nA dominant assumption among supporters of single-sex education is that it \ncontributes to achievement as it relieves students from perceived conflict, pressures, \ntensions, and temptations (Riordan, 2004). Riordan is emphatic that single-sex \nschools work for girls and boys, women and men, whites and non-whites; but he also \nadmits that the beneficial effects of single-sex schools are greatest among certain \ngroups such as Black or Hispanic females from low socioeconomic homes (Riordan, \n2004). Salomone (1999) lists many theories in favour of single-sex school, but \nexplains that \u201eeffects of single-gender schools have been greatest among students who \nhave been disadvantaged historically \u2013 disadvantaged minorities, low and working \nclass youth and females (so long as the females are not affluent)\u201f (pp.283-84). \nExtensive debates in the USA before and after The Hutchison Amendment in June \n2001, which made single-sex education unambiguously legal\n1\n, produced substaintial \nliterature in this area. However, \u201eSingle-sex education [remains] a complex web of \nunanswered questions\u201f (Salomone, 1999, pp.275). \nThis paper argues that single-sex education needs to be explored and analysed in the \nwider social context in the backdrop of the values and beliefs of the school \ncommunity. It draws from a recent research project carried out in Nottingham City\n2\n to \ndebate single-sex schooling with particular focus on ethnic minorities, who were a \nhigh majority because of the specific demographics of the research context. The study \nexplored views and perspectives of diverse local communities and stakeholders with \nregard to single-sex schooling, looking into educational, social, cultural and religious \nconcerns. The project was designed to ensure widespread consultations with the local \ncommunity and all concerned. In addition to the teachers, parents\/carers, community \nleaders, faith groups and others, a large number of students and young people from \nmixed schools, faith schools and single-sex schools participated in the study.  \nThe Study \nThe study was designed to seek the views and perspectives of the diverse range of \nstakeholders regarding single-sex schooling in a specific multi-ethnic urban context \n 3 \n(Single-Sex Education Report, 2007). In view of the potential diversity of the \nexpected research participants it was decided to deploy a number of varying \ninformation-gathering strategies. Barriers of access, language, writing ability, internet \naccess, cultural constraints, gender and others were recognised, and a range of \nmethods and formats were used to collect data. This included two questionnaires \u2013 \none for adults and one for young people (both administered on paper and online), \nconsultation events, focus groups and interactive voting.  \nSemi-structured questionnaires were the main tool for data collection, followed by \nfocus group discussions with purposively selected groups, and \u201einteractive voting\u201f \nwith members of the local Youth Council (age 11 to 18). One consultation event was \norganised prior to data collection, to discuss the project format and content of the first \nquestionnaire with the diverse stake holders and the wider community. Over 245 local \ncommunity groups and all members of Nottingham City\u201fs Race Achievement Forum \nwere invited to this meeting, which was attended by 48 people - some participants \nchose not to register their attendance for political reasons. The majority of attendees \nwere from minority ethnic groups and it later emerged from other conversations that \nin general the White British people did not see single-sex education as a key issue.  \nThe sample for the study included staff, students, parents\/carers and governors of the \nsingle-sex comprehensive school, staff and parents\/carers from ten feeder primary \nschools, students from twenty other secondary schools, members of the Youth \nCouncil, and representatives of community organisations\/groups. An explicit attempt \nwas made to include those people in consultations who were pertinent to the study, \nand those who traditionally lacked voice, particularly those previously defined as \n\u201ehard to reach\u201f, by providing appropriate mode, grouping and environment to voice \ntheir opinions. The paper draws on the data collected from:  \n1. Questionnaires (total questionnaires served, 5670) \na. Adult responses 1045 (on paper) + 156 online \nb. Young people responses 159 (on paper) + 22 online \n2. Twelve focus groups with mature people: six women only, four men only, and \ntwo specific groups \n 4 \n3. Ten focus groups with young people: six groups (both single-sex and mixed) \nfrom four schools, three youth groups, and the Nottingham City Youth \nCouncil group. \n4. Two open community consultation events \nThe data were rich and highly complex, raising multiple concerns. It pointed to the \ncomplexity of the issue and contending perspectives. The findings highlighted that \nsingle-sex education was important to certain ethnic and faith communities; however, \nsupport for this preference varied with gender, age, and heritage factors. Second, a \ndominant assumption among supporters of single-sex education was that it \ncontributed to achievement by relieving students from perceived tensions, temptations \nand pressures. This paper debates the significance of single-sex education as \nemphasised by some groups and discusses the factors underpinning their perceptions. \nSingle-Sex Education: a preference? \nSingle-sex schooling emerged as \u201every important\/important\u201f to 58.6% adult \nrespondents while 39.5% stated that it was either \u201enot very important\u201f or \u201enot at all \nimportant\u201f to have a single-sex school. A key finding was that single-sex education \nwas considered more important by male respondents. While 51.5% women said that \nsingle-sex education was \u201every important\u201f\/\u201eimportant\u201f, reflecting a relatively divided \nopinion, 69% of male respondents stated that single-sex education was \u201every \nimportant\u201f\/\u201eimportant\u201f, raising some important questions. First, does this favouring of \nsingle-sex education reflect the desire to have single-sex education only for girls, or \nfor both boys and girls? Second, does it indicate a genuine educational need or is it \nthe reinforcement of gendered division and social control? The data signal that \nsupport for single-sex education in this case is for girls-only provision, thus pointing \nto sensitive and complex gender issues such as stereotyping, social patterns and \ngender roles. This was confirmed in the focus groups where male supporters of single-\nsex education talked about need for girls-only schools, while female supporters of \nsingle-sex education explicitly maintained that single-sex schooling should be for \nboth girls and boys.  \nA complex picture emerges when responses are further analysed by religion\/belief, \nethnicity, and heritage. About 90% of all Muslims, 27% of Christians, 28% of No \n 5 \nReligion and 52.9% of others stated that single-sex education was \u201every \nimportant\/important\u201f, evidencing a high preference for single-sex education among \nMuslims (Shah, 1999). An overwhelming majority of all respondents supporting \nsingle-sex education, however, were from minority ethnic groups belonging to the \nMuslim faith. For 69.6% White British respondents single-sex education was \u201enot \nimportant\u201f\/\u201enot at all important\u201f, while among other minority ethnic groups for \nexample, only 13% of Pakistani, 4.8% of Kashmiri, 1.8% of Bangladeshi, 8.6% of \nArab and 0% of Afghan respondents said that single-sex education was \u201enot \nimportant\/not at all important\u201f, reflecting the association between faith, ethnicity and \nsingle-sex education.  \nThe respondents were also monitored by heritage (heritage for the purposes of this \nstudy is defined as born in the UK\/not born in the UK). According to the research \nfindings, single-sex education received less support from British-born ethnic minority \npeople. Single-sex education was identified as \u201every important\/important\u201f by 43.6% \nof respondents born in the UK and 60.6% of those not born in the UK, thus indicating \nthat a higher number of those not born in the UK favour single-sex education. This \npointed to changing attitudes and the impact of societal culture (as compared to \nparent- or country-of-origin-culture), and environment on educational preferences. \nEven faith had less impact here as only 32% of Muslim young people stated that they \nwould consider going to a single-sex school given the choice. There were interesting \nvariations not only across different ethnic groups but also within ethnic groups in \nterms of age and gender, as shown in Table 1, presenting responses from on ethnic \ngroup\n3\n: \nMatrix Indicating Responses for\/against Single-Sex Education from one Ethnic \nGroup \n \n \n \nAge\/Gender For Neutral Against Total \nBoys (11-18) 0 0 4 4 \nMen 9 0 0 9 \nWomen 3 0 3 6 \nYouth Centre 7 1 0 8 \nTotal 19 1 7 27 \n 6 \nTable 1 shows that very young boys oppose single-sex schools, and about half of the \nfemale respondents from this ethnic group are also not in favour of single-sex \neducation. Those who appear to support single-sex education are men and mature \nyouths, inviting questions such as: is the younger, British-born generation more in \nfavour of co-educational institutions? Why do men support single-sex schools so \noverwhelmingly \u2013 particularly for girls? Is it a \u201ediscourse of control\u201f over women? Is \nit a religious obligation? Is it a cultural requirement? The study raises many questions \nand this paper attempts to engage with the relevant debates to explore these issues. \nWhy Single-Sex Education? \nA range of arguments are offered in favour of single-sex schooling by its proponents \n(Salomone, 1999). The primary concern is generally an environment conducive to \nbetter educational performance and achievement (Weiner, 1994), which this study \nalso confirmed. Some respondents, however, highlighted cultural\/faith dimensions, \nclaiming that \u201eParents may choose a single-sex school purely because it is single-sex, \nwhich is appropriate in their faith\/culture, rather than because of the quality of the \nschool\u201f. Nevertheless, the majority were of the opinion that they would choose a \nschool that attends to the cultural\/religious needs of the learners, emphasising \ncultural\/faith dimensions but not necessarily single-sex schooling. Question three in \nthe adult questionnaire asked \u201ewhat is most important to you?\u201f listing the following \noptions: \n1. A School that considers my Child\u201fs Religious\/Cultural Needs \u2026 \n2. A Single-Faith School \n3. A School that Promotes Diversity \u2026 \n4. A Single-Sex School \n5. Other \nAn overwhelming majority ticked the first and the third options as the most important, \nwhich indicated that single-sex schools might not be a favoured option if children\u201fs \nreligious and cultural needs are considered, and if diversity is promoted through an \nunderstanding of different cultures\/religions (Merry, 2007). This draws attention to \nthe serious issue of what schools and school leaders need to engage with to manage \ndiversity in multi-ethnic\/multi-faith Britain (Shah, 2009; 2006a). Responses to a \n 7 \nsimilar question in the young people\u201fs questionnaire reinforced the earlier findings \nthat the main priority of young people is an inclusive, democratic and equal \nopportunities environment rather than a single-sex or single-faith school. Only 27 out \nof 181 young respondents ticked the single-sex option, which was the lowest score for \nany category in this question. There was overwhelming support for those schools \nwhich would provide good education (140), equal opportunities (143) and equal \nparticipation (103). \nThe focus group data also reflected a similar spread of responses. The comments of \nthe participants who supported single-sex education were collated under four main \nheadings: education, culture, religion\/belief and social. A large number of participants \nbelieved that single-sex schools provided a \u201ebetter learning environment\u201f arguing that \n\u201emore focus [is] on education rather than the opposite sex\u201f, and complained that \n\u201eteachers often favour one gender over another in their teaching in a mixed school\u201f. \nMany drew attention to \u201eprivate sector single-sex schools [that] enjoy high profile and \nachievement\u201f. Another perspective supported single-sex schools as a cultural\/religious \nrequirement claiming that \u201ein Muslim culture girls are not allowed to go out with \nboys, which is not a problem in a single-sex school\u201f. Many Muslim research \nparticipants emphasised single-sex schools as a religious requirement, while others \nbelieved that \u201egirls feel comfortable and at ease\u201f and are \u201emore safe and secure\u201f with \n\u201ereduced risk of sexual temptation\/teenage pregnancy\u201f in girls-only schools.  \nSome of these comments are reflective of a perceived threat to religious values of the \nMuslim faith community (Griffin, 2006). Muslim parents expressed concerns \nregarding co-educational provision, particularly for their girls and specifically during \nteenage years (Bemmelen and Vliet, 1985). There was, however, an \nacknowledgement that limiting young people to single-sex institutions had a negative \nimpact on their social skills. Although the majority of the total participants in the \nfocus groups supported single-sex education, there were strong and explicit reasons \noffered by many, particularly women and young people, in support of co-education to \nprepare young people for \u201ethe real world\u201f.  \nMany research participants suggested a compromise by proposing that the schools \nshould be co-educational but some activities\/subjects should be taught in single-sex \nclasses, and separate spaces should be available for girls and boys for certain \n 8 \npurposes. This draws attention, for example, to recent experiments with single-sex \nsubject classes which are discussed in some detail in the next section to explore their \nsignificance towards achievement. \nSingle-Sex Education and Achievement \nA high majority of Muslims participating in this study and a clear majority of all \nparticipants favoured single-sex education. A common perception was that students in \na single-sex environment are high achievers. Feminists have argued that single-sex \nschools\/classes could provide a liberating experience for young girls contributing to \npositive self-concept and subject choices by providing a more supportive environment \n(Smithers and Robinson, 2006). Kenway et al. (1998) posit that \u201eSingle-sex classes for \ngirls may also act as a nurturing emotional refuge\u201f (p.150), pointing to the potential of \nsingle sex institutions to offer equality in an unequal world. Riordan (2004) argues \nthat single-sex institutions enhance achievement in the case of marginalised groups. \nResearch, however, is inconclusive in this regard as confirmed by available literature.  \nAnother aspect is related to behaviour and self-concept. In a study from Northern \nIreland, Granleese and Joseph (1993) deployed a domain specific self concept \nmeasure in their study of girls from one single-sex and one co-educational secondary \nschool. Girls at the single-sex school were less critical of their own behavioural \nconduct than girls in the mixed school. This lack of criticism was the single best \npredictor of global self-worth in the all-girls' school. The data for this study also \nhighlighted similar observations, hinting at factors such as relaxed attitudes, freedom \nto dress in whatever way the girls prefer, less stress about personal appearance and \nthat of others etc.  \nInitially purported by feminists with regard to girls\u201f education (Weiner, 1994), \nsupport for single-sex education currently also underpins the recent government \npolicy towards boys-only teaching provision with the perceived expectation to \nimprove boys\u201f achievement in schools. Arguments for boys-only schools\/classes \nclaim that boys have less distraction in a boys-only class and can concentrate better on \nstudies. This has led to experimentations of single-sex classes in many co-educational \nschools in the UK. The introduction of single-sex classes within co-educational \nschools is a strategy adopted by some schools to enhance the learning experiences of \n 9 \neither the girls or the boys, depending upon the educational climate at the time. \nJackson (2002) explores the value of introducing single-sex classes within co-\neducational schools, drawing upon the perspectives of girls and boys involved in one \nsuch initiative. The research concludes that girls-only classes may have positive \neffects for girls, but there was no evidence of any positive effect on boys\u201f \nachievement (Jackson, 2002). Barker\u201fs study (2002) of single-sex classes of maths \nand sciences in a middle school also corroborates this evidence, claiming that the \nsingle-sex environment contributed to girls', but not boys' feelings of empowerment, \npeer support and positive self-concept. Lee and Lockheed's study (1990) of 1,012 \nstudents in ninth-grade Nigerian public schools measured achievement in \nmathematics. Girls in single-sex schools outperformed girls in mixed-sex classes in \nmathematics, while boys in single-sex schools did the opposite even after the study \nhad been adjusted for substantial differences in student background, school resources \nand teacher attitudes.  \nHarker and Nash (1997) used data gathered in a longitudinal study of more than 5,000 \neighth-grade students in New Zealand that was controlled for individual \ncharacteristics (such as socioeconomic status) and school type. As with other studies, \nthe researchers confirmed statistically significant differences in favour of girls at \nsingle-sex schools. After applying controls for ability levels and for social and ethnic \nbackgrounds, however, the differences disappeared. Harker (2000) used data from a \nlongitudinal study of 37 schools and from the Ministry of Education National \nDatabase to explore in detail the relative achievements of girls in single-sex and \ncoeducational schools, with careful controls for the student population differences at \nthe two types of school. He concluded that when such controls are exercised, the \napparent differences between the two types of school were reduced to non-significant. \nHarker (2000) explored gender differences in achievements at a variety of levels in \nsecondary schools in New Zealand. Gender differences were shown in relation to \nEnglish, mathematics and science, but the pattern was not consistent across year \nlevels in the senior school. He confirms that research findings are ambiguous \nconcerning the effects of single-sex schools on girls' achievement. In many studies \nwhere outcomes initially suggested that teaching within a single-sex environment was \nmore conducive to girls than boys, any differences between the two sexes diminished \n 10 \nonce the findings were adjusted for socio-economic or ability variables (Harker, \n2000).  \nIt is argued that single-sex teaching has the potential to raise achievement levels in \nsome contexts but that this potential can be realised when differential teaching \napproaches are systematically planned and explicitly implemented, monitored and \nevaluated. Younger and Warrington (2002) studied single-sex teaching in a co-\neducational school where single-sex teaching had been the norm since the school was \nestablished in the early 1970s, and found that the relative improvement levels of both \ngirls and boys over time were similar. Interviews with staff and students, and analysis \nof patterns of classroom interactions, suggested that both girls and boys benefited \nfrom having their own learning space, although there were issues about the \nreintegration of students, particularly boys, when mixed lessons were provided in the \nfoundation subjects in years 10 and 11 (Younger and Warrington, 2002). This concern \nover reintegration was expressed in the focus groups for this study, particularly by the \nyoung people and the female participants and is discussed later in this paper.  \nIn terms of single-sex schooling and its association with achievement, there is no \nconclusive evidence. It is argued that \u201efor\u201f or \u201eagainst\u201f stances which shape popular \nliterature on single-sex education can be misleading because assessments of single-\nsex education's success or failure are linked to multiple factors such as institutional \ngoals and ethos, indicators of success used, historical context and status of school, \nstudent selection processes, and others. Historically single-sex schools have been \nprestigious and private and are held in greater esteem because they generally have \nselective admission policies to screen the large number of applicants. According to \nRiordan (1990) policies in single-sex schools that emphasize the academic side of \neducational activities explain the higher score. If the school factor is controlled then \nthere is no consistent evidence of differential achievement regarding girls and boys in \nsingle-sex or co-educational schools\/classes. LePore and Warren (1997), using data \nfrom the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, found that boys in single-\nsex schools did not increase their test scores any more than boys in co-educational \nschools and that girls experienced no statistically significant positive effects of single-\nsex school enrolment. Another recent project in a Pembroke school experimented with \norganising mixed gender groups in one half-year and single-gender groups in the \n 11 \nother half year for English, mathematics, science, history and technology (Research \nReport, 2006). The research concluded that the data showed no consistent or \nappreciable impact on attainment in the different groups. \nResearch is inconsistent in its assessments of whether single-sex education is \u201ebetter\u201f \nthan co-education for girls or boys or both. Some research supports the view that \nsingle-sex contexts foster less stereotypical views of subjects and that girls view the \nsingle-sex classroom as more conducive to learning, but research fails to confirm \nsignificant gain in girls' achievement in the single-sex classroom (Lee and Marks, \n1990). The interim findings report (The Standards Site, 2006) from a DfES \ncommissioned team of educational specialists working with schools around the \ncountry, makes some similar points: \n Conflicting evidence over whether examination results are better for pupils \ntaught in single-sex groups.  \n Pupils are almost always in favour of single-sex groupings, especially girls.  \n Teacher opinion is often divided, but most acknowledge greater levels of \nparticipation in lessons and increased confidence amongst both sexes.  \n All-boy sets can be difficult to manage, although teachers often feel that \nbehaviour is better in single-sex groups.  \nAnother recent study (Sullivan, 2006) confirms that empirical findings on the \nquestions of single-sex schooling and self-esteem, self-concept and participation in \ngender-atypical subjects, have been mixed. Some advocates of single-sex schooling \nfor girls have argued that girls\u201f self-esteem is better fostered in a single-sex \nenvironment, as boys tend to dominate in a mixed environment. Some research does \nsuggest association between single-sex schools\/classes and achievement, feelings of \nempowerment, sense of comfort and positive self-concept, and highlights girls\u201f \npreference for single-sex groupings. Many studies, however, have different findings. \nSullivan (2006) quotes studies arguing that single-sex classes within co-educational \nschools provide mixed results and that research is inconclusive.  \nIn the present study, parents\/carers, particularly males from some ethnic\/faith groups, \ndo voice a preference for single-sex education for various reasons including \neducational achievement and undivided concentration on studies. Responses from \n 12 \nyoung people, however, were more in favour of co-education, with separate classes \nfor PE & PSHE and separate personal spaces for boys and girls. This may not suggest \nimplications for educational achievement as such, but its association with a sense of \ncomfort and an \u201einfiltration free zone\u201f (Haw, 1998) cannot be argued with. This can \nbe a reference to gendered role socialisation transferred from homes and home-\ncultures to educational spaces with hidden implications for girls\u201f comfort levels in co-\neducation and with implications for their holistic development. This aspect gains \nparticular significance in the light of current governmental policy on the Every Child \nMatters Agenda (Education Act, 2004) where schools are being heavily encouraged to \nextend their engagement with children and young people beyond the traditional remit \nof academic achievement. There is a growing requirement to look at the needs \n(complex or otherwise) of the \u201ewhole\u201f child\/young person (Merry, 2007): namely \nhealth, making a positive contribution, economic well-being, safety and enjoyment \n(Education Act, 2004). Is a single-sex environment more conducive to satisfying these \nneeds in the case of girls? Do girls feel more happy, relaxed and comfortable in a \nsingle-sex environment? Is it an issue of power relations between the sexes, \ntransferred from the wider social stereotyping, affecting girls\u201f experiences of co-\neducation? If so, what implications does this have for educational engagement and \nachievement?  \nIn many studies exploring ethnic educational achievement Muslim girls emerge as a \nhigh achieving group compared to Muslim boys (Abbas, 2006; Ahmed, 2001; \nBirmingham City Council, 2005; DFES, 2004). Is this contradictory evidence or does \nthis mean that girls work harder to break out of the \u201eglass ceiling\u201f? The studies point \nto socio-cultural structures among Muslim communities where girls\/women engage \nwith education with higher commitment because this is perceived as a way to progress \ncompared to boys\/men. A complex picture emerges here, pointing to multiple factors \nimpacting on Muslim girls\u201f performance, and single-sex schools can be just one of \nthese.  \nSingle-Sex Education, and discourses of faith, culture and gender \nSex-segregation has remained a conspicuous feature of Muslim societies, favouring \nsingle-sex institutions. The rhetoric emphasises it as an Islamic injunction. It is, \nhowever, a relative concept recommended so far as it is essential to maintain the \n 13 \nsocial fabric of a Muslim society with its specific discourses of family and sex. Some \nMuslim communities or individuals perceive sex-segregation as a religious requirement, \nbut it is not supported by religious texts (Shah, 1998). The Quran recommends preferred \ndemeanours for men and women\n4\n, but it does not command sex-segregation, and \nparticularly not with reference to teaching\/learning situations. Sex-segregation as \ndefined by the Quran is a part of a particular educative programme for men and \nwomen and is linked with the discourses of sex and family in Islam. It aims at \ncreating a non-threatening environment to ensure equal participation of men and \nwomen in public as well as in private. It is to facilitate this participation, and not for \nthe purposes of marginalising women. The preferences for appropriate dress and \nbehaviour code put forward in the Quran for mixed contexts indirectly negate sex-\nsegregation. The Prophet Mohammed himself taught men and women, together at times, \nin the mosque of Medina (Al-Hibri, 1982; Mernissi, 1991; 1993). His wife Ayesha \ncontinued to teach men and women in the same mosque. Therefore, sex-segregated \ninstitutions can not be mandatory in Islam as they are not explicitly validated either by \nthe Quran or the Sunnah. \nSegregatory tendencies in Muslim societies, however, can be attributed to Islamic \nnotions of sex, sexuality, and morality. Sexual activity is highly proscribed and \ncircumscribed in Islam and any sex outside marriage is strictly forbidden (Al-Ghazali, \n1995). Chastity is emphasised with a promise of 'forgiveness and reward' to 'men and \nwomen who guard their chastity' (Quran, 33:35). Muslim parents demanding single-\nsex education for girls can be apprehensive of the wider social context within which \neducation is provided and the popular notions of sex, morality and marriage which are \nactive in the host society (Shah, 1998), as reflected in the data collected during this \nconsultation. Many Pakistani immigrants now settled in Britain continue to send their \nyoung daughters back to Pakistan to be educated in a single-sex context, incurring the \ncost of air fares and maintenance for many years because of this perceived threat to \ntheir \u201emoral code\u201f by schools offering co-education. \u201eAsian parents are very \nprotective of their daughters because of their perceptions of English society's \nproblems with drugs, alcohol, and undue emphasis on sex' (Ali, 1996, p.411). \nDistance can be and often is maintained from the indigenous society and its culture \noutside educational institutions, but schools are a different matter where \u201eprotecting \ntheir daughters\u201f may become a challenge if it is co-education. \n 14 \nAnother important factor in deciding an appropriate environment for their children\u201fs \neducation is the dominant discourses within extended family and community (Shah, \n2008). Islamic teachings and injunctions regarding the immediate and extended family, \nand other Muslims, for example, are reinforced by the local patterns of behaviour \nconcerning family and bradari (Bagguley and Hussain, 2007; Shain, 2001; Tyrer and \nAhmad, 2006). It becomes a doubly emphasised phenomenon, deeply embedded in \nideology and culture, creating a network of relationships that is complex, fluid and \nencompassing, impacting on decision-making in many matters which would be \nconsidered personal in individualistic societies. Hence personal decisions like sending \ngirls to single-sex or co-education schools may often be decided under direct or indirect \npressures of extended family and community. Even when a particular family or parents \nmay not have any preference for single-sex schooling, they may choose the single-sex \noption in submission to the pressures from the extended family, 'bradari\u2019, or community \n(Shah, 1998; Shaw, 1988), as submission to the collective sub-culture is essential for \nsurvival within bradari networks (Sharma, 1980).  \nArranged marriage is another powerful discourse influencing parental preference for \nsingle-sex education within certain communities. Co-education is perceived as a \nthreat to arranged marriages as it may open other venues of thought and options. The \ngirls in co-education may choose to exercise personal choices, defying collective \ndecisions. The assumption appears to be that girls-only schools provide \u201einfiltration \nfree zones\u201f in which to educate the girls, without posing any serious threats to cultural \ntraditions with regard to arranged marriage and family networks. Studying or working \nin a mixed-sex environment after marriage does not emerge as a serious issue (Shah, \n1998). A marriage is perceived as a collective rather than an individual matter. In fact, \narranged marriages are not always simply organised by parents, but are often decided \nunder huge pressures from extended families and bradaris. In the collective cultures \nof these societies, underpinned by the network of arranged marriages, parents often \nhave difficulty in questioning bradari authority (Basit, 1995). \nThe issue of single-sex schools has complex socio-cultural dimensions, specifically with \nregard to girls\u201f education, not just for Muslims but for many other communities and \nsocieties. It is often used as a political mode of ordering roles and practices. Single-sex \ninstitutions provide \u201einstitutionalised boundaries\u201f (Mernissi, 1985, p.137) and \n 15 \nhighlight the technologies of power (Foucault, 1980) wielded for exercise of control \nover cultural practices. For some ethnic\/faith communities such as Muslims, Asians \nand others it is linked to concepts and practices such as izzat (honour), arranged \nmarriages and family networks. Izzat in its simplest form means respect and honour but \nin the case of women, a complex discourse of izzat becomes active which is gendered, \nfamilial and social, and which as such has no legal or religious validations. It imposes \nconstraints on women by making them responsible for izzat (Anwar, 1978; Shah, \n1999; Weiss, 1994), thus giving it a gendered description, which underpins the \ndemand for single-sex education for girls in particular, preparing them for a specific \nsocial role. The consistency of such cultural patterns of behaviour is confirmed by the \nmajority of Muslim respondents participating in this study demanding single-sex \neducation for girls, although a few voices are also heard voicing a challenge to the \ndominant discourse. \nRoles are social constructions, be these domestic roles or public. In the case of \nMuslims, social roles are often enmeshed with religious roles to the extent that to \ndisentangle and identify the discourses is problematic (Shah, 2006b). Socio-cultural \nnorms and discourses determine gender roles and practices in the private and the \npublic areas and define the sites. Women are to be restrained to the private\/domestic \ndomain which requires limiting their movement to women-only space, in this case \nsingle-sex schools. For a woman it would be a violation of family izzat to move into \n\u201emale domains\u201f and here izzat as a technology of power serves its purpose: control of \nwomen. Interestingly, in the first Muslim society of Medina, during the Prophet\u201fs \nlifetime, two major public sites were the mosque and the battle-field, and Muslim \nwomen participated in both (Ahmed, 1992; Mernissi, 1991; Smith, 1987). The \ntechnologies to restrain or confine women illuminate patriarchal modes of ordering \ngendered power relations, which have a relevance to the Foucauldian argument that \ndiscourses are never free of history, power and interests (1980, p.131). \nIf sex-segregation is not a religious requirement in essence, then why did a high \nmajority of Muslims participating in this study favour single-sex institutions? This \ndraws attention to more complicated and sensitive issues related to cultural values and \ninterpretations of faith as located in cultural contexts. The inner diversity of Muslim \nUmmah\n5\n is obvious from Muslim demographics across the world. There are fifty-two \n 16 \nMuslim states, in addition to huge Muslim population living in secular countries all \nover the world, including India, China, Africa, and Western countries. This raises \nquestions regarding the impact of cultural and faith systems on educational choices, \nparticularly the implications of these experiences for educational choices. \nConclusions \nSingle-sex education is a complex and sensitive issue. Its impact on the educational \nachievement of learners (boys or girls) is just one facet of the debate. Equally significant \nare cultural, social, political, economic, religious and other dimensions of the issue \n(Skelton et al., 2007). Any one or combinations of these elements may become \nsignificant for achievement in a particular situation at a particular time. The two major \nthemes that emerge from this study are, first, a perceived link between educational \nachievement and single-sex schooling, especially among male respondents; and second, \nimpact of culture\/faith in demanding single-sex schools specifically for girls.  \nAs discussed above, association between single-sex education and achievement is \ninconclusive, reflected in contending debates around issues such as:  \n What does achievement mean in itself?  \n Is it a score or a grade?  \n Is it holistic development of the students as put forward in the Every Child \nMatters agenda?  \n How can association between single-sex education and achievement be \nmeasured in the face of multiple variables such as school type, resources, \nlocality, learners and their personal\/social positioning, to name just a few? \nEven the studies which try to control various factors are extremely tentative in their \nfindings and hasten to explain them as context\/factor specific (Harker, 2000; Harker and \nNash, 1997; Riordan, 2004). A feminist argument in favour of single-sex schools has \nbeen that being in a women\u201fs environment is both empowering and nurturing (Weiner, \n1994). Gender stereotyping and bias are seen as major factors in influencing \nteaching\/learning where girls might receive less attention and fewer opportunities \ncompared with boys. Furthermore, girls from certain ethnic\/cultural\/economic \nbackgrounds might feel inhibited in mixed-sex settings, becoming less motivated to \n 17 \nengage in classroom activities, which in turn might affect their educational \nperformance. A counter argument, however, supported by many of the younger \nparticipants in this study is that girls-only institutions are a departure from the \u201ereal \nworld\u201f, creating a cloistered environment in which women who are unable to compete \nwith men receive special attention, essentially claiming that these educational settings \ndo not enable them to learn social skills or be prepared for real life \nsituations\/activities. \nAnother side to this debate on single-sex education is its culture-defined nature. A \nconsistent theme projected by the participants in this study was that single-sex education, \nparticularly for girls, was \u201eimportant\u201f\/\u201every important\u201f for certain ethnic\/faith groups, \nnamely Muslims including Arabs, Bangladeshis, Kashmiris, Pakistanis as well as \nothers, which emphasises the impact of beliefs and culture on these choices or \npreferences. As discussed in the relevant section above, however, there is clearly less \nsupport for single-sex education from the very young and British-born and also from \nwomen\/girls within these same faith\/ethnic groups. This is a significant finding \nwhich, in part, highlights the need for specific educational provision for certain \nethnic\/faith groups, a factor which needs to be acknowledged by the policy-makers for \nthe purposes of decision-making, but at the same time highlights variations in choices \nwith regard to gender, age and changing social structures. The findings also unpick intra-\ngroup variation of opinions pointing to power relations with regard to gender in certain \nsocial structures, emerging resistance to those structures, and changing attitudes and \npriorities of the very young and British born, which have higher significance for long \nterm planning and decision making. \n \n****************** \nAcknowledgements \nThank you to the University of Leicester for the study-leave which enabled the lead \nauthor to work on this paper.  \nThank you to the Nottingham City Children Services Team for their support while \nworking on this project.

The significance of the \nconcept can be recongised from the fact that there are sixty-four occurrences of the term Ummah in the Quran.  \n"}
