Disability is a \nparticular challenge in low income countries, some emerging from war and \nconflict, many facing deepening political, economic and governance \nchallenges.  \n \nThere is often a reciprocal relation between disability and poverty. Thus, for \nexample, the parent of a child with a mobility impairment may have to leave \nwork to care for the child. In the absence of assistive devices and transport \nthey may have to carry the child or adolescent on their backs, possibly \ndeveloping chronic back problems as well as severe mental distress as a \nresult of the almost impossible demands of the situation. Because of the \ndifficulties of getting around, and especially if the child is a girl, they may be \nunable to attend school, even if the school is willing to accept disabled \nchildren. The child is denied the education and training they would need to \nsupport themselves in years to come.  \n \nClearly psychologists have a key role to play in researching the complex array \nof experiences and responses characterising disabled peoples\u2019 opportunities \nto live positive lives in low income settings. If such understandings are to have \nactionable implications for intervention and policy, however, they need to be \ncontextualised within wider multi-disciplinary frameworks which take account \nof the political, legal, economic and biomedical contexts of disability, as well \nas the interplay of local, national and global imperatives in shaping disabled \npeoples\u2019 lives. \n \nThis landmark volume serves as an invaluable handbook in this regard. \nEdited by two leading international psychologists, both world leaders in the \npsychology of disability and development, the chapter authors come from a \nrange of specialisations. These include clinical, educational and rehabilitation \npsychology, physiotherapy, law, human rights, and social policy.  \n \nThirteen chapters are arranged in three sections yielding a wealth of \ntheoretical, empirical and practical insights. The first section contextualises \nthe challenges facing the disability and development field, through case \nstudies from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Kyrgyzstan. It includes \nattention to the close links between disability issues and governance; the \nchallenges of developing sound disability policy, particularly in failed or newly \nemerging states; and the fraught process of implementing positive \ninternational and national policy recommendations in real life settings.  \n \nThe second section focuses on research development. Drawing on \nexperiences from Africa, Bolivia and Papua New Guinea, it discusses \nresearch partnerships between academics and disability networks; how \nresearchers might best generate information that can have positive impacts \non disabled peoples\u2019 lives \u2013 within a research ethos that maximises the role of \ndisabled people in research participation and ownership; the need to build the \ntechnical capacity of disabled people to play this role; and the cultural \ncomplexities of conducting \u2018scientifically rigorous\u2019 research in complex \nmarginalised settings.  \n \nThe third section discussed specific research findings and challenges. \nChapters explore the disability-AIDS interface in sub-Saharan Africa, framed \nby attitudes to disability and sexuality; the organisational systems challenges \nof making assistive technology available in low income settings; the needs of \ndisabled children in Sierra Leone and Burkina Faso; and the challenges of \nensuring inclusive educational provision from earliest years to tertiary levels. \nThe final chapter provides a multi-layered account of caring for children with \ncerebral palsy in South Africa, looking at transport and health infrastructure, \naccessing grants, family and gender dynamics, health professionals\u2019 attitudes, \nand the interface of traditional and biomedical health practices. \n \nIn some ways this collection serves as a tribute to the agency and courage of \nthe disabled and their families, often in impossibly difficult circumstances. On \nthe other hand it highlights the on-going suffering and frustration people often \nface in highly disabling social settings. The book highlights the urgent need for \ninternational development agents to pay more attention creating enabling \nsocial environments. It also provides an important contribution to the on-going \nchallenge of building a sound knowledge base to inform such efforts. \nPsychologists have a key role to play here, within a wider inter-disciplinary \nframework, and this volume should serve as both inspiration and sourcebook   \nfor future psychological research. \n \nCatherine Campbell, Institute of Social Psychology, London School of \nEconomics \n \n"}
