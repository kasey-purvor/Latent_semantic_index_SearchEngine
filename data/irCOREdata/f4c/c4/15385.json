Fault-tolerance. Bipan-\ncyclicity.\n1 Introduction\nLow-dimensional tori are regularly used as interconnection networks in distributed-\nmemory parallel computers. For example, the Alpha 21364-based HP GS1280 ma-\nchine [10], the iWarp [6] and the Cray X1E vector computer have a two-dimensional\ntorus as their interconnection networks, while the Cray T3D and T3E [22] have three-\ndimensional tori as theirs. Furthermore, two-dimensional mesh and torus topologies\nare popular choices for networks-on-chips [28]. This has helped to motivate a consid-\nerable amount of work on the structural aspects of (arbitrary dimensional) tori, and in\nparticular their uniform variants k-ary n-cubes, that are relevant to parallel computing\nas well as being of interest in purely graph-theoretic terms. For example, the k-ary\nn-cube Qkn has the following basic properties: it is vertex- and edge-symmetric [1]; it\nis Hamiltonian [3, 7]; it has diameter nbk2 c [3, 7]; it has a recursive decomposition;\nand it contains embeddings of many important interconnection networks such as cy-\ncles (of certain lengths) [1], meshes (of certain dimensions) [3] and even hypercubes\n(of certain dimensions) [7]. Moreover, it has admirable properties in relation to routing,\nbroadcasting and communication in general (see, for example, [1, 7, 11]).\nOf particular relevance to us are some recent results concerning paths and cycles\nembedded within k-ary n-cubes. Paths and cycles are fundamental in parallel com-\nputing; for not only is there a multitude of algorithms specifically designed for linear\narrays of processors and cycles of processors but paths and cycles appear as data struc-\ntures in many more algorithms for parallel machines whose processors are intercon-\nnected in a wide variety of topologies. We shall be concerned with questions relating\nto Hamiltonicity, pancyclicity, bipancyclicity and edge-bipancyclicity (these concepts\nare defined in the next section). The existence of these properties in an interconnec-\ntion network enables a much higher degree of flexibility with regard to the simulation\nof linear arrays or cycles of processors. The results of [24] are of significance to us,\nwhere earlier results due to Hsieh, Lin and Huang [16] and to Wang, An, Pan, Wang\nand Qu [27] were extended and the situation as regards the pancyclicity and bipan-\ncyclicity of Qkn was settled. Amongst other results, it was shown in [24] that Qkn is\nedge-bipancyclic, when n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3, and k-pancyclic, when n \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3 is\nodd.\nAs more and more processors are incorporated into parallel machines, faults be-\ncome more common, be it faults in the processors or on the connections between pro-\ncessors. Of course, the temporary unavailability of a connection between two proces-\nsors due to, for example, high traffic can also be regarded as a fault. Given the signif-\nicant cost of parallel machines, we would prefer to be able to tolerate (small numbers\nof) faults and still be able to use our parallel machine. Whilst \u2018static\u2019 structural results\nsuch as those mentioned above are important, we are interested here in the tolerance\nof k-ary n-cubes when a (limited) number of edges are faulty (that is, are missing). In\nparticular, we are interested in how many faulty edges a k-ary n-cube Qkn can tolerate\nyet still remain bipancyclic and k-pancyclic.\nAs the k-ary n-cube Qkn has degree 2n, an immediate upper bound on the number\nof faulty edges Qkn can tolerate and still remain bipancyclic or k-pancyclic is clearly\n2n\u2212 2 (for we can make the edges from a vertex to 2n\u2212 1 of its neighbours faulty and\nthere clearly can be no cycle through the vertex). Consequently, many studies assume\nthe conditional fault assumption on the distribution of the faults so that no matter how\nmany faulty edges there are, it is always the case that every vertex is incident with\nat least 2 healthy edges (the legitimacy of this conditional fault assumption is given\ncredence as there is a very small probability that a configuration of faulty edges will\n2\nbe such as to make a vertex of one of our networks have degree less than 2). For\nexample, under this conditional fault assumption: it was shown in [2] that Qkn with\n4n\u2212 5 faulty edges still has a Hamiltonian cycle (and that this result is optimal); it was\nshown in [26] that an n-dimensional alternating group graph with 4n\u2212 13 faulty edges\nstill has a Hamiltonian cycle (and that this result is optimal); it was shown in [19] that\nan n-dimensional crossed cube with 2n\u2212 5 faulty edges still has a Hamiltonian cycle\n(and that this result is optimal); and in [15] a more general consideration of matching\ncomposition networks was made with regard to whether they remain Hamiltonian under\na limited number of faults. Other Hamiltonicity results under our conditional fault\nassumption are available in, for example, [8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 25]. As far as we are\naware, [25] is the only paper to have considered pancyclicity issues in a family of\ninterconnection networks in the presence of faulty edges and under our conditional\nfault assumption: in [25] it was proven that, under our conditional fault assumption, an\nn-dimensional hypercube with 2n\u2212 5 faulty edges remains bipancyclic (and that this\nresult is optimal).\nIn this paper we resolve the situation as regards pancyclicity and bipancyclicity in\nk-ary 2-cubes under our conditional fault assumption. In particular, we prove that a\nk-ary 2-cube Qk2 with 3 faulty edges but where every vertex is incident with at least 2\nhealthy edges is bipancyclic, if k \u2265 3, and k-pancyclic, if k \u2265 5 is odd (these results are\noptimal). We go on to show that when k \u2265 4 is even and n \u2265 3, any k-ary n-cube Qkn\nwith at most 4n\u2212 5 faulty edges so that every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy\nedges is bipancyclic, and that this result is optimal. The proof of this latter result is\nlong and complicated and uses a variety of techniques concerning the combinatorial\nmanipulation of k-ary n-cubes (in the presence of faults) that are interesting in their\nown right. In the next section we detail the basic definitions relevant to this paper, and\nin Section 3 we prove our results for the k-ary 2-cube. In Section 4 we prove our main\nresult concerning the bipancyclicity of Qkn when k is even. We give our conclusions\nand directions for further research in Section 5.\n2 Basic definitions\nFor k \u2265 3 and n \u2265 1, a k-ary n-cube Qkn has a vertex set of {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}n and\nthere is an edge ((un, un\u22121, . . . , u1), (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1)) if, and only if, |ui \u2212 vi| = 1\n(mod k), for some i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, with uj = vj , for all j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}\\{i}; such\nan edge is termed as lying in dimension i (throughout, arithmetic on the components\nof vertices is modulo k). A k1 \u00d7 k2 torus has vertex set {(u, v) : u \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k1 \u2212\n3\n1}, v \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k2 \u2212 1}} and there is an edge ((u1, u2), (v1, v2)) if, and only if,\n|ui \u2212 vi| = 1 (mod ki), for some i \u2208 {1, 2}, with uj = vj , for j 6= i. We sometimes\nrefer to edges of the form ((i, j), (i, j + 1)) (resp. ((i, j), (i+1, j))) in a k-ary 2-cube\nor a k1 \u00d7 k2 torus as lying on row i (resp. in column j).\nLet i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. We say that we partition Qkn over dimension i if we consider\nQkn to be the disjoint union of copies Q0, Q1, . . . , Qk\u22121 of Qkn\u22121 as follows: for each\nj \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u22121},Qj is the subgraph ofQkn induced by the vertices ofQkn whose ith\ncomponent is j (we suppress i, n and k in the notation as they are always understood).\nClearly, all edges not in some Qj lie in dimension i. Suppose that we have partitioned\nQkn over dimension i as Q0, Q1, . . . , Qk\u22121 and x = (xn, xn\u22121, . . . , x1) is some vertex\nof some Qj . The vertex (xn, . . . , xi+1,m, xi\u22121, . . . , x1) of Qm is denoted as nm(x)\n(and so x = nj(x)).\nWe consider k-ary n-cubes with faulty edges (or simply faults); that is, where cer-\ntain edges are missing. Thus, a faulty k-ary n-cube is really just a copy of Qkn where\nsome edges, the faulty edges, are missing, and where we refer to the edges that remain\nas the healthy edges. Even though our faulty edges are regarded as missing edges, we\nstill say, for example, that a vertex v is incident with some faulty edge e when the edge\ne was originally incident with v before it was removed. On occasion, we want to em-\nphasise that all edges of some sub-graph are healthy and so we say, for example, that a\ncycle or a path is healthy.\nA conditional fault assumption is an assumption relating to the faults (in our case,\nfaulty edges) and their distribution within an interconnection network (which for us is\nalways a k-ary n-cube). The conditional fault assumption we make is that the distribu-\ntion of faults is such that no vertex in any faulty k-ary n-cube is ever incident with less\nthan 2 healthy edges (that is, has degree less than 2 when we regard our faulty k-ary\nn-cube as being a k-ary n-cube with some edges missing).\nA graph on n vertices is: pancyclic if it contains a cycle of every length from 3 up to\nn; edge-pancyclic if there is cycle of every length from 3 up to n containing any given\nedge; and m-pancyclic if it contains a cycle of every length from m up to n. Of course,\nno bipartite graph can be pancyclic (as there can be no odd length cycles); consequently,\na notion of pancyclicity has been devised for bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph on n\nvertices is bipancyclic if there is an even length cycle of every even length from 4 up\nto n, and edge-bipancyclic if there is an even length cycle of every even length from\n4 up to n containing any given edge. Even though the notions of bipancyclicity and\nedge-bipancyclicity have been devised to primarily apply to bipartite graphs, it still\nmakes sense to apply them to non-bipartite graphs too. We shall be building cycles of\nvarious lengths in faulty k-ary n-cubes. We say that a cycle C, of length c, say, can be\n4\nprogressively shortened to a cycle of length c\u2032, say, if starting fromC we can iteratively\napply the following construction to obtain cycles of all lengths c, c \u2212 2, c \u2212 4, down\nto c\u2032: in the current cycle C\u2032, replace a sub-path (u, v, w, y) of length 3 with the edge\n(u, y) to obtain a cycle of length 2 less than the length of C\u2032 (note that we also describe\na cycle in a graph as a sequence of vertices so that consecutive vertices in the sequence\nare joined by an edge in the cycle, as well as there being an edge from the last vertex\nof the sequence to the first).\nIf pi is a property of graphs then a graph G is said to be m-edge-fault-tolerant pi\nif G still has property pi even after the removal of at most m edges from G. Thus,\nfor example, to say that a k-ary n-cube Qkn is (4n\u2212 5)-edge-fault-tolerant bipancyclic\nunder the conditional fault assumption that no vertex is incident with less than 2 healthy\nedges means that no matter which 4n \u2212 5 edges we remove from Qkn, so long as no\nvertex in the resulting graph has degree less than 2, there is a cycle of every even length\nm where 4 \u2264 m \u2264 kn.\nA graph G is vertex-symmetric if given any two distinct vertices u and v of G, there\nis an automorphism of G mapping u to v. Similarly, a graph is edge-symmetric if given\ntwo distinct edges e and f of G (possibly incident), there is an automorphism of G\nmapping e to f . We shall use the fact that Qkn is edge-symmetric [2] throughout. The\nk-ary 2-cube Qk2 has a number of automorphisms. For example, the maps (i, j) 7\u2192\n(i + 1, j), (i, j) 7\u2192 (i, j + 1), (i, j) 7\u2192 (k \u2212 1 \u2212 i, j), and (i, j) 7\u2192 (i, k \u2212 1 \u2212 j) are\nall automorphisms of Qk2 .\n3 The case when n = 2\nWe begin by dealing with the k-ary 2-cube Qk2 in which there are 3 faulty edges.\nLemma 1 Consider a k-ary 2-cube Qk2 , for some even k \u2265 6, in which there are at\nmost 3 faulty edges but where every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges.\nThere is a cycle of length l for every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nProof There exists some dimension containing at least 2 faulty edges, which w.l.o.g.\nwe assume is dimension 2; that is, these 2 faulty edges are column edges. As Qk2 is\nedge-symmetric [1], w.l.o.g. we may assume that the edge ((0, 0), (k\u2212 1, 0)) is faulty.\nCase 1: all faulty edges lie in dimension 2; that is, all faults are column faults.\nWe remark that throughout the proof of this case, we never use edges of the form\n((k\u2212 1, i), (0, i)) and so we may simply ignore the faulty edge ((0, 0), (k\u2212 1, 0)) and\n5\nassume that we are working in the k \u00d7 k grid with wrap-around edges of the form\n((i, k \u2212 1), (i, 0)), for i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. Consider the Hamiltonian cycle of Qk2 as\npictured in Fig. 1(a) (although we have only drawn a Hamiltonian cycle in Q82, the\nanalogous cycle in Qk2 , for any even k \u2265 6, should be clear). This cycle, which we\ncall the E-cycle rooted at (0, 0), can be translated (horizontally) by simply increasing\nthe first component of every vertex by 2, and yet another cycle can be obtained by\nincreasing the first component of every vertex by 4. Note that the 3 Hamiltonian cycles\nso obtained are edge-disjoint when we consider only column edges (as k \u2265 6). Thus,\nat least one of these Hamiltonian cycles contains only healthy edges; call it C. W.l.o.g.\nwe may assume that C is the E-cycle rooted at (0, 0).\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(a)\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\nfaulty edges\n(b)\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\nshortened by 4\nlengthened by 2\n(c)\nFigure 1. An E-cycle and progressive shortening in Q82.\nIf our copy of Qk2 had no faulty edges then we could clearly progressively shorten\nC by at each step removing 3 edges and including 1 new edge, so that we obtain a\nhealthy cycle of every even length l for which 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2. However, in the process\nof progressively shortening our cycle, we might try to include a new edge that is actu-\nally faulty (note that we encounter at most 2 faulty edges in our process of progressive\nshortening). We deal with this situation as follows. Our process of progressive short-\nening begins by introducing column edges; so, with reference to Fig. 1(a), we shorten\nour cycle \u2018from the right-hand side\u2019 (note that there are k2 \u2265 3 ways in which we could\ndo this). We also ensure that we shorten the cycle in this way as much as we can be-\nfore having to deal with attempting to introduce a faulty edge. If we try to introduce a\nfaulty edge then we simply \u2018jump\u2019 that particular iteration of our process of progressive\nshortening and instead of shortening the cycle by 2, we shorten the cycle by 4, unless\nthe next edge to be introduced is faulty too, when we shorten the cycle by 6. Note that\nbecause of how we have chosen to progressively shorten our cycle up until this point,\nwe can simultaneously lengthen our cycle by 2 or 4 (in a different part of the cycle) to\nensure that we obtain cycles of all the required lengths. The process can be visualized\nin Fig. 1 where we have encountered a faulty edge in Fig. 1(b) and \u2018jumped\u2019 over it in\n6\nFig. 1(c) as well as lengthened our cycle by 2 (there are subtleties when at least 1 of\nour column faults is of the form ((i, 1), (i + 1, 1)) but such configurations can easily\nbe coped with).\nCase 2: exactly 2 faulty edges lie in dimension 2; that is, there are exactly 2 column\nfaults.\nCase 2.1: The 3 faults are such that they do not form a path of length 3 starting with a\ncolumn edge, followed by a row edge, and ending with a column edge.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that ((0, 0), (k\u22121, 0)) is a faulty edge and that the row fault is\nnot incident with any column fault different from ((0, 0), (k\u2212 1, 0)). As in Case 1, we\nnever use edges of the form ((k \u2212 1, i), (0, i)) and so we may simply ignore the faulty\nedge ((0, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0)) and assume that we are working in the k \u00d7 k grid with wrap-\naround edges of the form ((i, k\u2212 1), (i, 0)), for i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. By translating the\nE-cycle rooted at (0, 0) (as illustrated in Fig. 1(a)) by increasing the first component\nof every vertex by 1, 2, and so on, w.l.o.g. we may assume that: we have a (not\nnecessarily healthy) Hamiltonian cycle C in Qk2 that is the E-cycle rooted at (0, 0);\nC contains no faulty column edge; and C contains a faulty row edge and this faulty\nedge is one of {((i, k\u2212 4), (i, k \u2212 3)), ((i, k \u2212 3), (i, k\u2212 2)), ((i, k \u2212 2), (i, k \u2212 1))},\nfor some i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} (note that if C contains no faulty row edge then we\ncan progressively shorten C, as in Case 1, so as to obtain healthy cycles of every even\nlength l where l is such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2, \u2018jumping\u2019 over faults as in Case 1).\nDepending upon where the faulty row edge lies, we now amend our cycle C anal-\nogously to the illustration in Fig. 2(a) where: we remove the faulty row edge and its\n\u2018opposite\u2019 (healthy) edge on the same \u2018branch\u2019 of the E-cycle; we include the column\nedges which join the two edges just removed; and we \u2018join\u2019 the resulting disconnected\npath to the main cycle by removing a column edge and including two row edges. What\nresults is a healthy Hamiltonian cycle C that can be progressively shortened just as we\ndid in Case 1, above (and \u2018jumping\u2019 over the faulty column edge, should it be encoun-\ntered), so that we obtain a cycle of length l for every even l for which 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nCase 2.2: the 3 faults form a path in the form of a column edge followed by a row edge\nfollowed by a column edge.\nW.l.o.g. the faults are ((k \u2212 1, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and ((0, 1), (k \u2212 1, 1)) or the\nfaults are ((k \u2212 1, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and ((0, 1), (1, 1)). In the first case, we\nhave a healthy E-cycle rooted at (0, 1) and so the result clearly follows (by proceeding\nas in Case 1). In the second case, the Hamiltonian cycle as depicted in Fig. 2(b) can be\nprogressively shortened so that we obtain a healthy cycle of length l for every even l\nfor which 2k \u2264 l \u2264 k2 (although we have only depicted this Hamiltonian cycle in Q82,\n7\nthe analogous cycle in Qk2 , for any even k \u2265 6, should be clear). It is trivial to obtain\nhealthy cycles of even length from 4 up to 2k \u2212 2.

Amending the E-cycle in Q82 and a Hamiltonian cycle.\nLemma 2 Consider a 4-ary 2-cube Q42 in which there are at most 3 faulty edges but\nwhere every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. There is a cycle of length l\nfor every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 16.\nProof There exists some dimension containing at least 2 faulty edges, which w.l.o.g.\nwe assume is dimension 2.\nCase 1: all faulty edges are column edges.\nFor i = 0, 1, 2, 3, let Ci be the cycle ((i, 0), (i, 1), (i, 2), (i, 3)). Both edges of at least\none of the edge-pairs\n\u2022 {((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1))}\n\u2022 {((0, 0), (3, 0)), ((0, 1), (3, 1))}\n\u2022 {((0, 2), (1, 2)), ((0, 3), (1, 3))}\n\u2022 {((0, 2), (3, 2)), ((0, 3), (3, 3))}\nare healthy; thus, we can \u2018join\u2019 C0 to C1 or C3, as appropriate and using these edges,\nto obtain a healthy cycle of length 8. We can also join C0 to an edge of C1 or C3, as ap-\npropriate and using these edges, to obtain a healthy cycle of length 6 (see Fig. 3(a) and\nFig. 3(b) for an illustration of these constructions). By continuing in the same way and\nusing the same reasoning with the resulting cycle of length 8, we can ultimately obtain\nhealthy cycles of every even length from 4 up to 16 as required.\nCase 2: exactly 2 faulty edges are column edges.\n8\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the edge ((0, 0), (0, 1)) is faulty. If it is the case that either\n((0, 0), (1, 0)) and ((0, 1), (1, 1)) are both healthy or ((0, 0), (3, 0)) and ((0, 1), (3, 1))\nare both healthy then we may proceed as we did in Case 1 and iteratively obtain healthy\ncycles of all the required lengths. Thus, suppose that 1 of the 2 edges ((0, 0), (1, 0)) and\n((0, 1), (1, 1)) is faulty and 1 of the 2 edges ((0, 0), (3, 0)) and ((0, 1), (3, 1)) is faulty.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the 3 faulty edges are ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (1, 0)), and\n((0, 1), (3, 1)) or they are ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 0), (3, 0)), and ((0, 1), (3, 1)) (recall our\nconditional fault assumption). In the former case, the Hamiltonian cycle in Fig. 3(c) can\nclearly be progressively shortened so that we obtain healthy cycles of lengths 14, 12,\n10, and 8, and it is trivial to find healthy cycles of lengths 6 and 4. In the latter case,\nwe have a healthy E-cycle rooted at (0, 1) and so can proceed as we did in Case 1 of\nLemma 1.

Joining cycles and a Hamiltonian cycle in a faulty Q42.\nLemma 3 Consider a k-ary 2-cube Qk2 , for some odd k \u2265 7, in which there are at\nmost 3 faulty edges but where every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges.\nThere is a cycle of length l for every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2 \u2212 1.\nProof There exists some dimension containing at least 2 faulty edges, which w.l.o.g.\nwe assume is dimension 2.\nCase 1: all faults are column edges.\nLet G be the wrap-around grid induced by the vertices of {(i, j) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2, 0 \u2264\nj \u2264 k \u2212 1}. W.l.o.g. we may assume that ((0, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0)) is a faulty edge and\nthat at least 1 other fault lies in G. The constructions of Case 1 of Lemma 1 apply\nto G and suffice for us to build a healthy cycle of length l for every even l such that\n4 \u2264 l \u2264 (k \u2212 1)k. Moreover, the cycle C of length (k \u2212 1)k spanning G is such that\nit contains a sub-path P of length k \u2212 1 consisting of all the vertices of row k \u2212 2. If\nG does not contain a faulty edge joining a vertex in row k \u2212 2 to a vertex in row k \u2212 1\nthen we can easily obtain a healthy cycle of every even length l where l is such that\n(k\u22121)k \u2264 l \u2264 k2\u22121 (by replacing alternating edges ((k\u22122, j)(k\u22122, j+1)) of P with\npaths (((k\u22122, j), (k\u22121, j)), ((k\u22121, j), (k\u22121, j+1)), ((k\u22121, j+1), (k\u22122, j+1)))).\nSo, suppose that ((k\u2212 2, j), (k\u2212 1, j)) is a faulty edge. Thus, G contains only 1 fault.\n9\nBy translating C if necessary, w.l.o.g. we may assume that (k \u2212 2, j) is the rth vertex\non P , for some odd r. Hence, by proceeding similarly we can obtain a healthy cycle\nof every even length l where l is such that (k \u2212 1)k \u2264 l \u2264 k2 \u2212 1 (the construction is\ndepicted in Fig. 4(a)).\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\nfaulty edge ((5,4),(6,4))\ngrid G with wrap-around\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\nfaulty edges\ngrid G with wrap-around\n(a) (b)\nFigure 4. Cycles in Q72.\nCase 2: exactly 2 faults are column edges.\nCase 2.1: The 3 faults do not form a path of length 3 starting with a column edge,\nfollowed by a row edge and ending with a column edge.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that: ((0, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0)) is a faulty edge; the row fault\n((i, j), (i, j + 1)) is such that i \u2264 k\u221212 ; and the row fault is not incident with any\ncolumn fault except possibly ((0, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0)). Let G be the wrap-around grid in-\nduced by the vertices of {(i, j) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1}. The constructions\nof Case 2.1 of Lemma 1 apply to G and suffice for us to build in G a healthy cycle of\nlength l for every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 (k \u2212 1)k. The cycle C of length (k \u2212 1)k\nso constructed is such that it contains a sub-path P of length k\u2212 1 consisting of all the\nvertices of row k\u2212 2. If there does not exist a faulty edge joining a vertex in row k\u2212 2\nto a vertex in row k \u2212 1 then we can easily obtain a healthy cycle of every even length\nl where l is such that (k \u2212 1)k \u2264 l \u2264 k2 \u2212 1 (just as we did above). If there is a fault\n((k \u2212 2, j), (k \u2212 1, j)) then we ensure that when we construct our healthy cycle C of\nlength (k \u2212 1)k above, the vertex (k \u2212 2, j) is the rth vertex on P , for some odd r.\nConsequently, we can obtain a healthy cycle of every even length l where l is such that\n(k \u2212 1)k \u2264 l \u2264 k2 \u2212 1.\nCase 2.2: the 3 faults form a path in the form of a column edge followed by a row edge\nfollowed by a column edge.\nW.l.o.g. the faults are ((k \u2212 1, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and ((0, 1), (k \u2212 1, 1)) or the\nfaults are ((k \u2212 1, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and ((0, 1), (1, 1)). In the first case, we\nhave a healthy E-cycle rooted at (0, 1) and so the result clearly follows (using the above\n10\narguments). In the second case, the cycle of length k2 \u2212 1 as depicted in Fig. 4(b) can\nbe progressively shortened so that we obtain a healthy cycle of length l for every even\nl for which 2k \u2264 l \u2264 k2 \u2212 1 (although we have only depicted this cycle in Q72, the\nanalogous cycle in Qk2 , for any odd k \u2265 7, should be clear). It is trivial to obtain\nhealthy cycles of every even length from 4 up to 2k \u2212 2. The result follows.\nLemma 4 Consider a 5-ary 2-cube Q52 in which there are at most 3 faulty edges but\nwhere every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. There is a cycle of length l\nfor every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 24.\nProof There exists some dimension containing at least 2 faulty edges, which w.l.o.g.\nwe assume is dimension 2.\nCase 1: all faulty edges are column edges.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the edge ((0, 0), (4, 0)) is faulty and that no other faulty\nedge joins a vertex in row 0 and a vertex in row k \u2212 1 (otherwise obtaining the result\nis trivial: simply assume we are working in the fault-free 5\u00d7 5 grid with wrap-around\nedges of the form ((i, 4), (i, 0)), find a cycle of an appropriate length and then, if\nnecessary, translate, via an appropriate automorphism, so that the column fault does\nnot lie on the translated cycle).\nSuppose that 2 faulty edges are of the form ((i, j), (i + 1, j)), for some fixed i \u2208\n{0, 1, 2, 3}. W.l.o.g. i = 0 or i = 1. It is trivial to see that if i = 0 then in the subgraph\nof Q52 induced by the vertices of {(0, i), (1, i) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 4} there are healthy cycles of\nlengths 4, 6, 8 and 10. Moreover, w.l.o.g. we may assume that the cycle of length 10 is\n((0, 0), (0, 1), . . . , (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3), . . . , (1, 0)). Of course, an analogous statement\ncan be made if there are 2 faulty edges of the form ((1, j), (2, j)). Regardless, it is\ntrivial to extend any such cycle of length 10 so as to obtain healthy cycles of all even\nlengths l where 4 \u2264 l \u2264 24. These extensions can be visualized as in Fig. 5 where a\ncycle of length 24 is shown that can be progressively shortened so as to obtain healthy\ncycles of any even length l for which 10 \u2264 l \u2264 24 (Fig. 5(a) corresponds to the case\nwhen i = 0 and Fig. 5(b) to that when i = 1).\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\nfaulty edges\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\n(b)(a)\nFigure 5. Cycles of length 24 in Q52.\n11\nSuppose that at most 1 faulty edge is of the form ((i, j), (i + 1, j)), for any fixed\ni \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. W.l.o.g., either there is a faulty edge e of the form ((0, j), (1, j)) or\nthere is a faulty edge e of the form ((1, j), (2, j)) with the other fault f (different from\n((0, 0), (4, 0))) of the form ((2, j\u2032), (3, j\u2032)). As above, we can construct healthy cycles\nof lengths 4, 6, 8 and 10 using the vertices of rows 0 and 1 or rows 1 and 2, respectively,\nso as to avoid e. W.l.o.g. the fault f different from e lies in column 0, 1 or 2. Depending\nupon where f lies, at least 1 of the cycles in Fig. 6(a), Fig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c) can be\nprogressively shortened so as to obtain healthy cycles of all lengths from 10 up to 24\nand so that all faults are avoided (in these 3 figures: the different possibilities for the\nfault f are shown using dashed lines, with Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b) depicting the situation\nwhen e joins vertices in rows 0 and 1 and Fig. 6(c) the situation when e joins vertices in\nrows 1 and 2; moreover, w.l.o.g. we have assumed that our cycle of length 10 spanning\nthe vertices on rows 0 and 1 or on rows 1 and 2, respectively, omits edges joining\ncolumn 4 vertices and column 0 vertices).\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\nfaulty edges\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\n(b)(a) (c)\nFigure 6. Cycles of length 24 in Q52.\nCase 2: exactly 2 faulty edges are column edges.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the row fault is ((4, 0), (4, 4)). If there is a column fault\nthat is incident with a vertex in row 4 then w.l.o.g. we may assume that this fault joins\na vertex in row 0 and a vertex in row 4 and that the other column fault lies in column 0,\n1 or 2. This being the case, at least one of the cycles in Fig. 6(a) or Fig. 6(b) is healthy\nand yields healthy cycles of any even length l for which 4 \u2264 l \u2264 24 (note that if the\ncolumn fault different from ((4, 0), (4, 4)) is ((0, 0), (1, 0)) then the cycle obtained by\nmapping the cycle in Fig. 6(a) according to the automorphism (x, y) 7\u2192 (4 \u2212 x, y) of\nQ52 suffices).\nHence, we may assume that the row fault is ((4, 0), (4, 4)) and that neither column\nfault is incident with a vertex on row 4. There exists an E-cycle rooted at (0,m), for\nsome m \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, and spanning the vertices of {(i, j) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 3, 0 \u2264 j \u2264\n4} that consists entirely of healthy edges. This E-cycle, of length 20, can clearly be\nextended using vertices in row 4 (no matter what the value of m) so as to obtain cycles\nof length 22 and 24, and the resulting cycle of length 24 can be progressively shortened\n12\nso as to obtain healthy cycles of any even length l for which 4 \u2264 l \u2264 18. The result\nfollows.\nThe proof of the following lemma is omitted as it can easily be obtained by hand\nby a case-by-case analysis (and the use of appropriate automorphisms).\nLemma 5 Consider a 3-ary 2-cube Q32 in which there are at most 3 faulty edges but\nwhere every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. There is a cycle of length l\nfor every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 8.\nWe draw the lemmas of this section together in the following corollary.\nCorollary 6 Let k \u2265 3. Consider a k-ary 2-cube Qk2 in which there are at most 3\nfaulty edges but where every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. There is a\ncycle of length l for every even l such that 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nWhen k is even then Corollary 6 is the best we can do, in the sense that as Qk2 is\nbipartite, there cannot be any cycle of odd length. However, when k is odd we can say\nmore.\nLemma 7 Consider a k-ary 2-cubeQk2 , where k \u2265 7 is odd, in which there are at most\n3 faulty edges but where every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. There is\na cycle of length l for every odd l such that k \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nProof Suppose that all faults are column faults. By proceeding as in the proof Case\n1 of Lemma 3, there is a healthy cycle C, contained within the subgraph induced by\nthe vertex set {(i, j) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 2, 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1}, of every even length l\nfor which 4 \u2264 l \u2264 k(k \u2212 1). Moreover, we may clearly arrange that every such\ncycle C contains an edge of the form ((k \u2212 2, j), (k \u2212 2, j + 1)) so that the path\n((k \u2212 2, j), (k \u2212 1, j), (k \u2212 1, j + 1), (k \u2212 2, j + 1)) is healthy. Thus, by joining any\nsuch cycle C (or any edge on row k \u2212 2) to a cycle of length k spanning the vertices\nof {(k\u2212 1, 0), (k\u2212 1, 1), . . . , (k\u2212 1, k\u2212 1)}, we can clearly obtain a healthy cycle of\nevery odd length l, where k \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nSuppose that there is a row fault but that it is not the case that the faults form a\npath consisting of a column fault, followed by a row fault and ending with a column\nfault. Again, similarly to above, the proof of Case 2.1. of Lemma 3 suffices to enable\nus obtain a cycle of every odd length l, where k \u2264 l \u2264 k2.\nFinally, suppose that w.l.o.g. the faults are ((k \u2212 1, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and\n((0, 1), (k\u22121, 0)) or the faults are ((k\u22121, 0), (0, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1)) and ((0, 1), (1, 1)).\n13\nIn the first case, we have a healthy E-cycle rooted at (0, 1) spanning the vertices of the\nfirst k \u2212 1 rows, which clearly suffices for us to construct a healthy cycle of every odd\nlength l where k \u2264 l \u2264 k2. In the second case, the healthy Hamiltonian cycle as\ndepicted in Fig. 7 can be progressively shortened so as to obtain a healthy cycle of any\nodd length l where 3k\u22122 \u2264 l \u2264 k2 (whilst we have depicted the cycle only for Q72, the\nconstruction in Qk2 , where k \u2265 7 is odd, should be clear). It is trivial to build healthy\ncycles of any odd length l for which k \u2264 l \u2264 3k \u2212 2 and so the result follows.\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\nfaulty edges\ngrid G with wrap-around\nFigure 7.

Cycles of length 25 in Q52.\n14\nSuppose that 2 faulty edges are of the form ((i, j), (i + 1, j)), for some fixed i \u2208\n{0, 1, 2, 3}. W.l.o.g. i = 0 or i = 1. We proceed as in the proof of Lemma 4 with the\ncycle as depicted in Fig. 8(a) (this cycle corresponds to the case when i = 0 and its\nimage under the automorphism (x, y) 7\u2192 (4\u2212 x, y) to that when i = 1).\nSuppose that at most 1 faulty edge is of the form ((i, j), (i + 1, j)), for any fixed\ni \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}. As in the proof of Lemma 4, w.l.o.g. either there is a faulty edge e\nof the form ((0, j), (1, j)) or there is a faulty edge e of the form ((1, j), (2, j)) with\nthe other fault f (different from ((0, 0), (4, 0))) of the form ((2, j\u2032), (3, j\u2032)). Sup-\npose that e is of the form ((0, j), (1, j)). The cycles in Fig. 8(b) and Fig. 8(c) suf-\nfice (if e = ((0, 1), (1, 1)) and f = ((2, 1), (3, 1)) then take the image of the cycle in\nFig. 8(b) under the automorphism (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, 4 \u2212 y)). Suppose that e is of the form\n((1, j), (2, j)) with the other fault f of the form ((2, j\u2032), (3, j\u2032)). The cycle in Fig. 8(d)\nsuffices (if e = ((1, 3), (2, 3)) then progressively shorten to obtain a healthy cycle of\nany odd length from 25 down to 11, and then build healthy cycles of lengths 9, 7 and 5\nseparately).\nCase 2: exactly 2 faulty edges are column edges.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that the row fault is ((0, 0), (0, 4)). If there is a column fault e\nthat is incident with a vertex in row 0 then w.l.o.g. we may assume that e joins a vertex\nin row 0 and a vertex in row 4 and that the other column f fault lies in column 0, 1\nor 2. No matter where f lies, so long as it is not ((0, 0), (1, 0)), one of the cycles in\nFig. 8(a), Fig. 8(b) or Fig. 8(c) suffices. Suppose that f = ((0, 0), (1, 0)). The cycle in\nFig. 9(a) suffices (note that ((0, 0), (4, 0)) is necessarily healthy).\n(0,0)\n(0,1) (0,2)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(0,3) (0,4)\nfaulty edges\n(a)\n(0,0)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(b)\n(0,0)\n(1,0)\n(2,0)\n(3,0)\n(4,0)\n(c)\nFigure 9. Cycles of length 25 in Q52.\nHence, we may assume that the row fault is ((0, 0), (0, 4)) and that neither column\nfault is incident with a vertex on row 0. Consider the cycle in Fig. 9(b) and its image\nunder the automorphism (x, y) 7\u2192 (x, 4 \u2212 y). These cycles suffice to yield the result\nwhen the two column faults do not lie in columns 0 or 4 (as these cycles can be progres-\nsively shortened to cycles of length 5 no matter where the 2 column faults lie, subject\nto them both not lying in columns 0 or 4). If the 2 column faults lie in columns 0 or 4\nthen the cycle in Fig. 9(c) suffices to yield the result. The result follows.\n15\nWe bring all the results of this section together in the following theorem.\nTheorem 9 Consider a k-ary 2-cube Qk2 in which there are at most 3 faulty edges but\nwhere every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges.\n(a) If k \u2265 3 then Qk2 is bipancyclic.\n(b) If k \u2265 5 is odd then Qk2 is k-pancyclic.\nAn equivalent formulation of the above result is that Qk2 is 3-edge-fault-tolerant\nbipancyclic, when k \u2265 3, and 3-edge-fault-tolerant k-pancyclic, when k \u2265 5 is odd,\nwith both results assuming the conditional fault assumption that no vertex is incident\nwith less than 2 healthy edges.\nTheorem 9 cannot be improved when k is odd, for it is not difficult to see that when\nn \u2265 2, Qkn has no odd length cycles of length less than k (see also [24]). Also, in Q32\nthere are configurations of 3 faulty edges so that even though every vertex is incident\nwith at least 2 healthy edges, no Hamiltonian cycle exists (one of these configurations\nis when the edges ((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((0, 1), (0, 2)), and ((0, 2), (0, 0)) are faulty edges).\nWe also note that (as was explained in [2]) Corollary 6 is optimal in the sense that there\nare configurations of 4 faults in Qk2 for which a Hamiltonian circuit does not exist, no\nmatter what the value of k (one such configuration is the set of faults {((0, 0), (0, k \u2212\n1)), ((0, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0)), ((1, 1), (1, 2)), ((1, 1), (2, 1))}).\n4 The general case\nIn this section, we prove our main result. The proof is long and complicated and so\nit might be beneficial if we outline our approach. Essentially, we proceed by induc-\ntion and partition Qkn over a specific dimension so that we can ensure that there is a\ncertain number of faults in this dimension (Theorem 9 deals with the base case of the\ninduction). That leaves the rest of the faults spread over the k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cubes that\nresult from the partition. We would like to apply the induction hypothesis to each of\nthese k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cubes and then piece together the resulting cycles to achieve our\nrequired result. However, there are two cases to consider: the first is where, when we\npartition, there is some k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cube that does not satisfy our conditional fault\nassumption; and the second is where this is not the case. The second case is split into\n2 further cases: when the faults not in the dimension over which we have partitioned\nare not co-located in the same k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cube; and the second case is when they\nare. Throughout, we build different healthy cycles of different (even) lengths, in a very\nnon-uniform fashion and using a variety of techniques.\n16\nTheorem 10 Let n \u2265 2 and let k \u2265 4 be even. Suppose that the k-ary n-cube Qkn\nhas at most 4n \u2212 5 faulty edges but is such that every vertex is incident with at least\n2 healthy edges. Then Qkn contains cycles of any even length from 4 up to kn; that is,\nQkn is (4n\u2212 5)-edge-fault-tolerant-bipancyclic under the conditional fault assumption\nthat every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges.\nProof Let n \u2265 3 throughout and suppose as our induction hypothesis that the result\nholds for Qkn\u22121. The base case of our induction follows from Theorem 9. Suppose that\nQkn has 4n\u22125 faulty edges so that every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges.\nThere exists some dimension i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} such that dimension i contains at least\n3 faults; w.l.o.g. we may assume that dimension 1 contains at least 3 faults. Partition\nQkn over dimension 1 to obtain Q0, Q1, . . . , Qk\u22121. There are at most 4n\u2212 8 faults not\ncontained in dimension 1. In each of the cases below, we construct healthy cycles of\nvarious lengths in a piecemeal fashion and using a number of different constructions.\nCase 1: there exists some vertex x in some Qi, where i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, such that\nx is incident with at least 2n\u2212 3 faults in Qi.\nW.l.o.g. we may assume that x lies in Q0. Note that x is the only vertex that is incident\nwith at least 2n\u22123 faults in the Qi in which it lies (as otherwise we would have 4n\u22127\nfaults not lying in dimension 1). Suppose that for every pair of neighbours y and z of\nx in Q0, with y 6= z, at least 1 of the edges (y, n1(y)) and (z, n1(z)) is faulty and at\nleast 1 of the edges (y, nk\u22121(y)) and (z, nk\u22121(z)) is faulty. So, there must be at least\n(2n \u2212 3) + (2n \u2212 3) + (2n \u2212 3) = 6n \u2212 9 > 4n \u2212 5 faults in total, which yields a\ncontradiction. W.l.o.g. we may assume that there are distinct edges (x, y) and (x, z)\nin Q0 such that (y, n1(y)) and (z, n1(z)) are healthy. Amend Q0 as follows so as to\nobtain Q\u02dc0.\n\u2022 If x is incident with a healthy edge (x,w) in Q0 and y 6= w 6= z then make\n(x,w) faulty and make (x, y) and (x, z) healthy.\n\u2022 If (x, y) (resp. (x, z)) is healthy then make (x, z) (resp. (x, y)) healthy.\n\u2022 If x is incident only with faults in Q0 then make (x, y) and (x, z) healthy.\nNote that in Q\u02dc0, vertex x is incident with 2 healthy edges and there are at most 4n\u2212 9\nfaults. Suppose that some other vertex u of Q0 is incident with at most 1 healthy edge\nin Q\u02dc0. So, we must have that (x, u) is an edge that is healthy in Q0 but which is made\nfaulty in Q\u02dc0. Thus in Q0, (x, u) is an edge that is the only healthy edge incident with\nx and 1 of 2 healthy edges incident with u, with the result that Q0 has at least 4n\u2212 7\nfaults, which yields a contradiction. Hence, we can apply the induction hypothesis\n17\nto Q\u02dc0 and so obtain a Hamiltonian cycle C0 in Q0 containing the (potentially faulty)\nedges (x, y) and (x, z) and where all other edges of C0 are healthy (in Q0).\nConsider Q1, which contains at most 2n \u2212 5 faults. The vertex n1(x) is incident\nwith at most 2n \u2212 2 healthy edges. We obtain Q\u02dc1 by making all healthy edges inci-\ndent with n1(x) faulty, apart from (n1(x), n1(y)) and (n1(x), n1(z)) which we make\nhealthy if necessary. This means introducing at most 2n \u2212 4 faults, and so Q\u02dc1 has\nat most 4n \u2212 9 faults. Suppose that Q\u02dc1 has a vertex that is incident with at most 1\nhealthy edge in Q\u02dc1. As any vertex of Q1 is incident with at least 2 healthy edges in\nQ1, this means that Q1 has at least 2n \u2212 4 faults, which yields a contradiction. Thus,\nwe can apply the induction hypothesis to Q\u02dc1 to obtain a Hamiltonian cycle C1 in Q1\nthat contains the edges (n1(x), n1(y)) and (n1(x), n1(z)) and where all other edges of\nC1 are healthy (in Q1). We can join C0 and C1 by removing the edges (x, y), (x, z),\n(n1(x), n1(y)) and (n1(x), n1(z)) and including the edges (y, n1(y)) and (z, n1(z))\nto obtain a cycle C01, spanning all vertices of Q0 and Q1 apart from x and n1(x), that\nhas length 2kn\u22121 \u2212 2 and which only contains healthy edges.\nIn the rest of this case, we construct cycles of every even length m, where 4 \u2264 m \u2264\nkn, with the cycle C01 providing a base cycle from which to work in many situations.\nMoreover, we do this for batches of values for m. For example, our first batch of\nvalues, below, is 3kn\u22121 \u2212 2 \u2264 m \u2264 (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 and our second is (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 \u2264\nm \u2264 kn\u2212(4n\u22122); eventually, we cover 4 \u2264 m \u2264 kn (throughout,m is always even).\nTo aid readability, we partition our constructions according to the techniques used. We\nremind the reader that k \u2265 4 is even and n \u2265 3.\nCase 1.1: Consider the path P1 of length kn\u22121 \u2212 2 from n1(y) to n1(z) on C1. By\npartitioning the vertices on this path into batches of 3 consecutive vertices and noting\nthat bk\nn\u22121\n\u22121\n3 c > 2n\u2212 2, where 2n\u2212 2 is an upper bound on the number of faults not\nin Q0, there are edges (u, v) and (v, w) of P1 such that all edges of\n{(ni(u), ni+1(u)), (ni(v), ni+1(v)), (ni(w), ni+1(w)), (ni(u), ni(v)),\n(ni(v), ni(w)) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1}\nare healthy.\nFix \u03b1 \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , k \u2212 1} and let i \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , \u03b1}. In Qi make all edges\nincident with ni(v) faulty apart from the edges (ni(u), ni(v)) and (ni(v), ni(w)),\nwhich are healthy, and denote the amended Qi by Q\u02dci. Note that Q\u02dci has at most\n(2n \u2212 5) + (2n \u2212 4) = 4n \u2212 9 faults. Also, if Q\u02dci has a vertex that is incident with\nat most 1 healthy edge in Q\u02dci then this means that Qi has at least 2n\u2212 4 faults, which\nyields a contradiction. By the induction hypothesis applied to Q\u02dci, we obtain a healthy\n18\nHamiltonian cycle Ci in Qi that contains (ni(u), ni(v)) and (ni(v), ni(w)). We can\njoin the cycles C01, C2, C3, . . . , C\u03b1 using healthy dimension 1 edges, as appropriate,\nto obtain a cycleD\u03b1 of length (\u03b1+1)kn\u22121\u22122 spanning all vertices of Q0, Q1, . . . , Q\u03b1\napart from x and n1(x).

Joining cycles together when \u03b1 is odd.\nSuppose that \u03b1 \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , k \u2212 3} and that \u03b2 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , kn\u221212 + 1}. Let P0\n(resp. P\u03b1) be the path of length kn\u22121 \u2212 2 (resp. kn\u22121 \u2212 1) on C01 (resp. C\u03b1) from y\nto z (resp. from n\u03b1(v) to n\u03b1(w), if \u03b1 is odd, and from n\u03b1(v) to n\u03b1(u), if \u03b1 is even).\nBy considering alternating edges of P0 and P\u03b1, there are at least k\nn\u22121\n\u22122\n2 +\nkn\u22121\n2 =\nkn\u22121 \u2212 1 mutually non-incident edges of P0 and P\u03b1. Count the number of such edges\n(s, t) for which the path (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t) is healthy, if (s, t) lies on P0, or for\nwhich the path (s, n\u03b1+1(s), n\u03b1+1(t), t) is healthy, if (s, t) lies on P\u03b1. This number is\nat least kn\u22121 \u2212 1\u2212 (2n\u2212 2) > \u03b2 and so we can choose \u03b2 such edges (s, t) and easily\nextend D\u03b1, using the appropriate healthy paths of length 3, to obtain a healthy cycle of\nlength (\u03b1 + 1)kn\u22121 \u2212 2 + 2\u03b2 (note that k \u2212 1 6= \u03b1 + 1); that is, we have constructed\nhealthy cycles of any even length from 3kn\u22121 \u2212 2 up to (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121.\nSuppose that \u03b1 = k\u2212 2 and \u03b2 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (2n\u2212 2)}; thus, D\u03b1 has length\n(k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 \u2212 2. By considering alternate edges on Pk\u22122 (as defined in the previous\nparagraph), there are kn\u221212 mutually non-incident edges of Pk\u22122. Count the number of\nsuch edges (s, t) for which the path (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t) is healthy. This number\nis at least k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (2n \u2212 2) \u2265 \u03b2 and so we can choose \u03b2 such edges (s, t) and easily\nextend D\u03b1, using the appropriate healthy paths of length 3, to obtain a healthy cycle of\nlength (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 \u2212 2 + 2\u03b2; that is, we have constructed healthy cycles of any even\nlength from (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 \u2212 2 up to kn \u2212 (4n\u2212 2).\nCase 1.2: We shall now construct healthy cycles of any even length from 4 up to\n2kn\u22121. By the induction hypothesis applied to Q1, there is a healthy cycle of any\neven length from 4 up to kn\u22121. Let C\u20321 be a healthy Hamiltonian cycle in Q1. By\nconsidering alternating edges on C\u20321, we have k\nn\u22121\n2 mutually non-incident edges on\nC\u20321. For each such edge (s, t), let the set of edges Ts,t = {(ni(s), ni+1(s)), (ni(t),\n19\nni+1(t)), (ni+1(s), ni+1(t)) : i = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 2}. Note that if all edges of some Ts,t\nare healthy then we can extendC\u20321 to obtain healthy cycles of lengths kn\u22121+2, kn\u22121+\n4, . . . , kn\u22121+2(k\u22122) by replacing the edge (s, t) with the paths (s, n2(s), n2(t), t), (s,\nn2(s), n3(s), n3(t), n2(t), t) and so on. At least k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (2n \u2212 2) of these Ts,t\u2019s\nare such that all of the edges in Ts,t are healthy, and so we can obtain healthy cy-\ncles of any even length from kn\u22121 up to kn\u22121 + 2(k \u2212 2)(k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (2n \u2212 2)) =\n(k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 \u2212 2(k \u2212 2)(2n \u2212 2) > kn\u22121 + (4n \u2212 4). Alternatively, suppose that\n2n\u2212 1 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 k\nn\u22121\n2 . By the induction hypothesis applied to Q1, there is a cycle C\n\u2032\u2032\n1 of\nlength 2\u03b2 in Q1. As \u03b2 > 2n\u2212 2, there is an edge (s, t) of C\u2032\u20321 such that both (s, n2(s))\nand (t, n2(t)) are healthy. Amend Q2 so as to ensure that exactly 2 edges incident with\nn2(s) are healthy, one of which is (n2(s), n2(t)) and the other of which is a healthy\nedge of Q2, and denote this amended version of Q2 by Q\u02dc2. It is also the case that\nevery vertex of Q\u02dc2 is incident with at least 2 healthy edges in Q\u02dc2. By the induction\nhypothesis applied to Q\u02dc2, there is a Hamiltonian path P2 in Q2 from n2(s) to n2(t)\nconsisting of healthy edges. Thus, we have a healthy cycle of length kn\u22121+2\u03b2 formed\nby joining C\u2032\u20321 to P2. That is, we have constructed a healthy cycle of every even length\nfrom kn\u22121 + (4n \u2212 2) up to 2kn\u22121. Hence, we have constructed a healthy cycle of\nevery even length from 4 up to 2kn\u22121.\nWe can extend any 1 of the cycles constructed in the previous paragraph as follows.\nIn the first construction, instead of starting with the cycle C\u20321, start with the cycle C01,\nof length 2kn\u22121\u22122, as constructed earlier. By applying identical reasoning (but noting\nthat at least k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 1 \u2212 (2n\u2212 2) of the Ts,t\u2019s are such that all of the edges in Ts,t are\nhealthy), we obtain a healthy cycle of any even length from 2kn\u22121 up to 2kn\u22121 \u2212 2 +\n2(k \u2212 2)(k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 1\u2212 (2n\u2212 2)) \u2265 2k\nn\u22121 \u2212 2 + 4(4\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 1\u2212 (2n\u2212 2)) = 2k\nn\u22121 +\n2.4n\u22121+2\u22128n\u2265 2kn\u22121+(4n\u22124). Alternatively, suppose that 2n\u22121 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 k\nn\u22121\n2 .\nInstead of starting with the cycle C\u2032\u20321 , of length 2\u03b2, as in the previous paragraph, start\nwith a cycle, as constructed in the previous paragraph, of length kn\u22121+2\u03b2 (recall, this\ncycle was obtained by joining C\u2032\u20321 to P2) and extend this cycle just as we did above\nbut using a Hamiltonian path in Q3. That is, we have constructed a healthy cycle of\nevery even length from 2kn\u22121+(4n\u2212 2) up to 3kn\u22121. Hence, taking into account our\nearlier constructions (above and in Case 1.1), we have constructed a healthy cycle of\nevery even length from 4 up to kn \u2212 (4n\u2212 2).\nCase 1.3: Thus, all that remains is for us to build healthy cycles of any even length from\nkn\u2212(4n\u22124) up to kn (of course, by [2] there is a healthy Hamiltonian cycle inQkn). Let\n\u03b2 \u2208 {k\nn\u22121\n\u2212(4n\u22124)\n2 ,\nkn\u22121\u2212(4n\u22126)\n2 , . . . ,\nkn\u22121\n2 }. By arguing exactly as we did earlier, we\ncan apply the induction hypothesis to Q\u02dc0 (as constructed earlier) and obtain a cycle C\u20320\n20\nin Q0 of length 2\u03b2 (note that 2\u03b2 > 4). There are two possibilities: either the cycle C\u20320\ncontains both (x, y) and (x, z); or the cycle C\u20320 does not contain x. In the former case,\nwe proceed exactly as we did earlier. First, we build a cycleC\u203201 of length kn\u22121+2\u03b2\u22122\nspanning all vertices of Q1 apart from n1(x) and all vertices of C\u20320 apart from x; and,\nsecond, we extend this cycle C\u203201 (as we did in Fig. 10) using (healthy) Hamiltonian\ncycles in each of Q2, Q3, . . . , Qk\u22121. Thus, we obtain a healthy cycle in Qkn of length\n(k\u22122)kn\u22121+kn\u22121+2\u03b2\u22122 = (k\u22121)kn\u22121+2\u03b2\u22122; that is, we have constructed healthy\ncycles of any even length from kn \u2212 (4n \u2212 2) up to kn \u2212 2. Consequently, we may\nassume that the cycleC\u20320 does not pass through the vertex x. By considering alternating\nedges on C\u20320, there is a set X of \u03b2 mutually non-incident edges (s, t) of C\u20320. Consider\nthe set of 2\u03b2 paths {(s, n1(s), n1(t), t), (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t) : (s, t) \u2208 X}. The\nnumber of faults not inQ0 is at most 2n\u22122 and as 2\u03b2 > 2n\u22122, w.l.o.g. we may assume\nthat there is an edge (s, t) of C\u20320 such that the edges of the path (s, n1(s), n1(t), t) are\nhealthy. Just as we have done throughout this proof, we can build a healthy Hamiltonian\ncycle C\u20321 in Q1 containing the edge (n1(s), n1(t)) and join C\u20320 and C\u20321 to obtain a\nhealthy cycle C\u203201 of length kn\u22121 + 2\u03b2. By continuing this argument iteratively, we\nobtain a healthy cycle of length (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 + 2\u03b2; that is, irrespective of whether the\nvertex x lies on C\u20320, we have healthy cycles of any even length from kn \u2212 (4n\u2212 4) up\nto kn.\nCase 2: every vertex x in any Qi, where i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u22121}, is such that x is incident\nwith at least 2 healthy edges in Qi.\nAs in Case 1, we construct cycles of various lengths in batches. There are two possi-\nbilities: either every Qi, where i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, contains at most 4n \u2212 9 faults;\nor w.l.o.g. Q0 contains 4n\u2212 8 faults.\nCase 2.1: every Qi, where i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, contains at most 4n\u2212 9 faults.\nW.l.o.g. suppose that Q0 contains most faults from Q0, Q1, . . . , Qk\u22121. In particular, if\ni \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1} then Qi contains at most 2n\u2212 4 faults.\nCase 2.1.1: no Qi, where i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1}, contains more than 2n\u2212 5 faults.\nBy the induction hypothesis applied to Q0, there are healthy cycles of any even length\nfrom 4 up to kn\u22121. In particular, there is a healthy Hamiltonian cycle C0 in Q0. By\nconsidering alternating edges on C0, we have k\nn\u22121\n2 mutually non-incident edges on\nC0. For each such edge (s, t), let the set of edges Ts,t = {(ni(s), ni+1(s)), (ni(t),\nni+1(t)), (ni+1(s), ni+1(t)) : i = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. Note that if all edges of some Ts,t\nare healthy then we can extendC0 to obtain healthy cycles of lengths kn\u22121+2, kn\u22121+\n4, . . . , kn\u22121+2(k\u22121) by replacing the edge (s, t) with the paths (s, n1(s), n1(t), t), (s,\n21\nn1(s), n2(s), n2(t), n1(t), t) and so on. Alternatively, we can obtain our healthy cy-\ncles by extending C0 by replacing the edge (s, t) with the paths (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t),\nt), (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22122(s), nk\u22122(t), nk\u22121(t), t) and so on. In fact, if there is only 1\nfaulty edge in Ts,t then we can clearly still extend C0 using healthy paths of lengths\n3, 5, . . . , 2(k2 \u2212 1) + 1 = k \u2212 1. So, let \u03b1 be the number of Ts,t\u2019s that contain exactly\n1 fault and let \u03b2 be the number of Ts,t\u2019s that contain at least 2 faults. By extending\nC0 using different paths, we can clearly obtain healthy cycles of all even lengths from\n4 up to kn\u22121 + 2(k \u2212 1)(k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u03b2)) + \u03b1(k \u2212 2) = k\nn \u2212 2(k \u2212 1)\u03b2 \u2212 k\u03b1.\nAs \u03b1 + 2\u03b2 \u2264 4n \u2212 5, we have that \u03b2 \u2264 (4n\u22125\u2212\u03b1)2 , and so k\nn \u2212 2(k \u2212 1)\u03b2 \u2212 k\u03b1 \u2265\nkn\u22122(k\u22121) (4n\u22125\u2212\u03b1)2 \u2212k\u03b1 = k\nn\u2212\u03b1\u2212 (k\u22121)(4n\u22125) \u2265 kn\u2212k(4n\u22125) \u2265 2kn\u22121.\nHence, we have constructed a healthy cycle of every even length from 4 up to 2kn\u22121.\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 2}. By the induction hypothesis, Q0 has a healthy Hamil-\ntonian cycle C0. By considering alternating edges on C0, there are k\nn\u22121\n2 mutually\nnon-incident edges of C0. Count the number of such edges (s, t) for which at least\n1 of (s, n1(s)) and (t, n1(t)) is faulty. This cannot be more than 4n \u2212 5. However,\nas k\nn\u22121\n2 > 4n \u2212 5, there is at least one edge (s, t) of C0 for which (s, n1(s)) and\n(t, n1(t)) are both healthy. Consider the vertex n1(s) in Q1. Amend Q1 by ensuring\nthat 2n \u2212 4 edges incident with n1(s) are faulty so that (n1(s), n1(t)) and exactly 1\nother edge incident with n1(s) are healthy, and denote the amended version of Q1 by\nQ\u02dc1. Thus, Q\u02dc1 has at most 4n\u2212 9 faults. Note that as Q1 contains at most 2n\u2212 5 faults\nthen every vertex in Q\u02dc1 is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. By the induction hy-\npothesis applied to Q\u02dc1, there is a healthy Hamiltonian path in Q1 from n1(s) to n1(t).\nThus, we have a healthy cycle of length 2kn\u22121 spanning all vertices in Q0 and Q1. We\ncan continue iteratively in this way (and as we have done previously) so as to obtain a\nhealthy cycle D\u03b1 of length (\u03b1+ 1)kn\u22121 spanning the vertices of Q0, Q1, . . . , Q\u03b1.\nSuppose that \u03b1 6= k \u2212 2 and let \u03b2 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , kn\u221212 }. Let P0 (resp. P\u03b1) be the\nsub-path of D\u03b1 spanning the vertices of Q0 (resp. Q\u03b1). Both of these paths have length\nkn\u22121 \u2212 1. By considering alternating edges on P0 and P\u03b1, there are kn\u22121 mutually\nnon-incident edges of P0 and P\u03b1. As kn\u22121 \u2212 (4n \u2212 5) > k\nn\u22121\n2 , we can choose \u03b2\nmutually non-incident such edges (s, t) so that either the path (s, n\u03b1+1(s), n\u03b1+1(t), t)\nor the path (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t) is healthy, depending upon whether (s, t) lies on\nP\u03b1 or P0, respectively (note that k \u2212 1 6= \u03b1+ 1). Consequently, we can clearly obtain\na healthy cycle in Qkn of length (\u03b1+ 1)kn\u22121 + 2\u03b2; that is, we have cycles of any even\nlength from 2kn\u22121 up to (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121.\nSuppose that \u03b1 = k \u2212 2 and let \u03b2 \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (4n \u2212 5)}. There are\nkn\u22121\n2 mutually non-incident edges on the sub-path Pk\u22122 of Dk\u22122 spanning the vertices\nof Qk\u22122. Just as in the previous paragraph, we can choose \u03b2 mutually non-incident\n22\nedges (s, t) on Pk\u22122 so that the path (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t) is healthy. Thus, we have\nhealthy cycles of any even length from (k\u22121)kn\u22121 up to kn\u2212(8n\u221210). In fact, if the\nnumber of faults joining a vertex in Qk\u22122 to a vertex in Qk\u22121 plus the number of faults\nin Qk\u22121 is \u03b3 then we have healthy cycles of any even length from 4 up to kn\u2212 2\u03b3. We\nshall return to this comment in a moment.\nAll that remains is for us to obtain healthy cycles of any even length from kn \u2212\n(8n \u2212 12) up to kn. Suppose that k\nn\u22121\n2 \u2212 (4n \u2212 5) + 3 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264\nkn\u22121\n2 . By the\ninduction hypothesis applied to Q0, there is a healthy cycle C0 of length 2\u03b2 in Q0. By\nconsidering alternating edges on C0, there is a set X of \u03b2 mutually non-incident edges\nof C0. For any edge (s, t) \u2208 X , define the path \u03c1k\u22121(s, t) = (s, nk\u22121(s), nk\u22121(t), t)\nand the path \u03c11(s, t) = (s, n1(s), n1(t), t), and count the number of such paths that\ncontain at least 1 fault. This number is at most 4n \u2212 5. So, if 2\u03b2 > 4n \u2212 5 then we\ncan find a path \u03c1k\u22121(s, t) or \u03c11(s, t) that consists entirely of healthy edges. However,\n2\u03b2 \u2265 kn\u22121 \u2212 (8n\u2212 10) + 6 > 4n\u2212 5, and so w.l.o.g. there is an edge (s, t) of C0 so\nthat the path \u03c11(s, t) = (s, n1(s), n1(t), t) consists entirely of healthy edges. We can\namend Q1 to obtain Q\u02dc1 so that n1(s) is incident with exactly 2n\u2212 4 faults in Q\u02dc1, one\nof which is (n1(s), n1(t)). Thus, Q\u02dc1 has at most 4n\u2212 9 faults. Moreover, every vertex\nin Q\u02dc1 is incident with at least 2 healthy edges. By the induction hypothesis applied to\nQ\u02dc1, there is a healthy Hamiltonian path from n1(s) to n1(t) in Q1. We can join this\npath with C0, using the healthy edges (s, n1(s)) and (t, n1(t)), so as to obtain a healthy\ncycle C01 of length kn\u22121 + 2\u03b2. As k\nn\u22121\n2 > 4n\u2212 5, we can iteratively extend C01 to a\ncycle of length (k \u2212 1)kn\u22121 + 2\u03b2; that is, we have healthy cycles of any even length\nfrom kn \u2212 (8n\u2212 16) up to kn.\nThus, we only have to find healthy cycles of lengths kn\u2212(8n\u221212) and kn\u2212(8n\u2212\n14). From our comment above, relating to the number \u03b3 of faults joining vertices\nin Qk\u22122 and Qk\u22121 or lying in Qk\u22121, we may assume that \u03b3 is 4n \u2212 5 or 4n \u2212 6.\nBy the induction hypothesis applied to Q0, we can find healthy cycles C\u20320 and C\u2032\u20320\nof lengths kn\u22121 \u2212 8n + 12 and kn\u22121 \u2212 8n + 14, respectively. As all but at most 1\nfault is incident with a vertex of Qk\u22121, there clearly exists an edge (s, t) of C\u20320 or C\u2032\u20320\nsuch that (s, n1(s)) and (t, n1(t)) are both healthy. Just as we have done a number\nof times so far, we can iteratively extend C\u20320 and C\u2032\u20320 by using appropriately chosen\nHamiltonian cycles in Q1, Q2, . . . , Qk\u22121 so as to build healthy cycles in Qkn of lengths\nkn \u2212 (8n\u2212 12) and kn \u2212 (8n\u2212 14). Thus, we have constructed healthy cycles of any\neven length from 4 up to kn.\nCase 2.1.2: some Qi, where i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1}, contains 2n\u2212 4 faults.\nIt must be the case that Q0 contains 2n\u2212 4 faults, Qi contains 2n \u2212 4 faults and this\n23\naccounts for all faults in Qkn apart from the 3 faults in dimension 1. W.l.o.g. we may\nassume that Q1 contains no faults. By the induction hypothesis applied to Q0, there is\na healthy cycle of length 2\u03b2 in Q0, for any \u03b2 \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , k\nn\u22121\n2 }. Let C0 be the cycle\nof length kn\u22121 in Q0 that we have just constructed and let x, y and z be consecutive\nvertices on this cycle so that all edges of {(nj(x), nj+1(x)), (nj(y), nj+1(y)), (nj(z),\nnj+1(z)), (nj(x), nj(y)), (nj(y), nj(z)) : j = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} are healthy. Such\nconsecutive vertices exist when k > 4 or n > 3 as bk\nn\u22121\n3 c > (2n \u2212 4) + 3. Sup-\npose that k = 4 and n = 3 and that there do not exist consecutive vertices x, y and\nz with the properties as stated. Note that there are 5 faults not lying in Q0. Enu-\nmerate the vertices of C0 as u0, u1, . . . , u15, and for 0 \u2264 l \u2264 15, let Tl be the set of\nedges {(nj(ul), nj+1(ul)), (nj(ul+1), nj+1(ul+1)), (nj(ul+2), nj+1(ul+2)), (nj(ul),\nnj(ul+1)), (nj(ul+1), nj(ul+2)) : j = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} (with addition on the indices\nof the ul\u2019s modulo 15). So, each of T0, T3, T6, T9 and T12 (which are mutually dis-\njoint as sets of edges) must contain a fault, and this accounts for all 5 faults. Also,\nT14 must contain a fault and so w.l.o.g. T12 must contain a dimension 1 fault of the\nform (nj(u14), nj+1(u14)). As T11 must contain a fault, T9 must contain a dimension\n1 fault of the form (nj(u11), nj+1(u11)). Arguing in this way yields that there must be\nmore than 3 dimension 1 faults which yields a contradiction. Hence, we can find x, y\nand z as required.\nAmend Qi so that ni(y) is incident with exactly 2 healthy edges, namely the edges\n(ni(x), ni(y)) and (ni(y), ni(z)) which are healthy in Qi. Denote this amended ver-\nsion of Qi by Q\u02dci. Note that Q\u02dci has at most 4n\u2212 8 faults. Suppose that Q\u02dci has at most\n4n \u2212 9 faults and there is a vertex that is incident with at most 1 healthy edge. This\nvertex must be a neighbour of ni(y) so that this edge is healthy in Qi and, further, it\nmust be incident with 2n\u2212 4 faults in Qi. So, in order to form Q\u02dci we must have intro-\nduced 2n\u2212 4 faults which yields a contradiction as Q\u02dci only has 4n\u2212 9 faults. Thus, if\nQ\u02dci has at most 4n\u2212 9 faults then every vertex of Q\u02dci is incident with at least 2 healthy\nedges. Alternatively, suppose that Q\u02dci has 4n\u22128 faults; so, we have made 2n\u22124 edges\nincident with ni(y) faulty (all except (ni(x), ni(y)) and (ni(y), ni(z))). In this case,\nthere might be a vertex w of Q\u02dci, adjacent to ni(y) and different from ni(x) and ni(z),\nsuch that w is incident with exactly 1 healthy edge in Q\u02dci. If such a vertex w exists then\nlet the edge (w, ni(y)) revert back to being healthy in Q\u02dci; otherwise, choose any faulty\nedge (w, ni(y)), where ni(x) 6= w 6= ni(z), and let it revert back to being healthy in\nQ\u02dci. Denote Q\u02dci after any additional amendments by Q\u02c6i (note that Q\u02c6i contains at most\n4n\u2212 9 faults).\nWe can now apply the induction hypothesis to Q\u02dci or Q\u02c6i, as appropriate, so as to\nobtain a cycle Ci of length kn\u22121. If we are working with Q\u02dci then Ci contains the\n24\nedges (ni(x), ni(y)) and (ni(y), ni(z)) and all edges of Ci are healthy in Qi; if we are\nworking with Q\u02c6 then Ci contains at least 1 of (ni(x), ni(y)) and (ni(y), ni(z)) and\nall edges of Ci are healthy in Qi. In the latter case, w.l.o.g. we may assume that Ci\ncontains (ni(x), ni(y)). Hence, whatever the case, we may assume that the cycle Ci\ncontains the edge ((ni(x), ni(y)) and that every edge of this cycle is healthy in Qi.\nFor each j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} \\ {0, i}, let Cj be the isomorphic copy of C0 in\nQj . For any l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k}, we can clearly join the cycles Ci, Ci+1, . . . , Ci+l\u22121\n(with arithmetic on indices modulo k) similarly to as is depicted in Fig. 10 so as to\nobtain a cycle Dl of length l.kn\u22121, spanning all vertices of Qi, Qi+1, . . . , Qi+l\u22121, that\nis healthy in Qkn. Fix any l \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1} and choose some edge (s, t) of Dl\nthat lies in Qi and for which (ni(s), ni\u22121(s)) and (ni(t), ni\u22121(t)) are healthy edges\n(such an edge clearly exists as kn\u221212 > 3). By [24], Qi\u22121 is edge-bipancyclic (note\nthat there are no faults in Qi\u22121) and so contains a (healthy) cycle of length 2\u03b2, for any\n\u03b2 \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , k\nn\u22121\n2 }, that contains the edge (ni\u22121(s), ni\u22121(t)). Thus, we obtain a\nhealthy cycle in Qkn of every even length m where 4 \u2264 m \u2264 kn.\nCase 2.2: Q0 contains 4n\u2212 8 faults.\nChoose some fault (x, y) in Q0 such that the path (s, n1(s), n1(t), t) is healthy and\namend Q0 so as to make this fault healthy. Applying the induction hypothesis to this\namended version of Q0 yields a healthy Hamiltonian path P0 in Q0 from x to y. We\ncan join this healthy Hamiltonian path in Q0 to its isomorphic copy in Q1, namely a\nhealthy Hamiltonian path P1 from n1(x) to n1(y). Thus, we can join P0 and P1 to\nobtain a healthy cycle of length 2kn\u22121. Let (s, t) be some edge of P1. We can replace\n(s, t) with the paths (s, n2(s), n2(t), t), (s, n2(s), n3(s), n3(t), n2(t), t), and so on, so\nas to obtain healthy cycles of lengths 2kn\u22121 + 2, 2kn\u22121 + 4, . . . , 2kn\u22121 + 2(k \u2212 2).\nChoosing other such edges and extending in the same way clearly enables us to build\nhealthy cycles of any length from 2kn\u22121 up to kn.\nConsiderQ1 andQ2. Neither contains a fault and there are at most 3 faults joining a\nvertex in Q1 to a vertex in Q2. Applying the induction hypothesis to Q1 yields healthy\ncycles of all even lengths from 4 up to kn\u22121. Let \u03b2 \u2208 {4, 5, . . . , k\nn\u22121\n2 } and let C1 be\nthe cycle in Q1 of length 2\u03b2 just constructed. There is an edge (s, t) of C\u2032 such that\nthe edges (s, n2(s)) and (t, n2(t)) are both healthy. By applying the induction hypoth-\nesis to an appropriately amended version of Q2, we can obtain a healthy Hamiltonian\ncycle C2 in Q2 containing the edge (n2(s), n2(t)). Hence, we obtain healthy cycles\nof all even lengths from kn\u22121 + 8 up to 2kn\u22121. In order to obtain cycles of lengths\nkn\u22121 + 2, kn\u22121 + 4 and kn\u22121 + 6, we extend a healthy Hamiltonian cycle in Q1 by\nreplacing up to 3 edges of this cycle of the form (s, t) with healthy paths of the form\n25\n(s, n2(s), n2(t), t). The result follows.\nIt was proven in [2] that there are configurations of 4n \u2212 4 faulty edges in Qkn,\nwhere k \u2265 3, so that even if every vertex is incident with at least 2 healthy edges,\nthere does not exist a Hamiltonian cycle. Such a configuration is obtained by taking\na cycle (x, y, u, v) in Qkn and ensuring that all edges incident with x are faulty apart\nfrom (x, y) and (x, u) and that all edges incident with u are faulty apart from (u, y)\nand (u, v). This amounts to 4n \u2212 4 faults. If x and u both lie on some cycle in (the\nfaulty) Qkn then this cycle is necessarily (x, y, u, v). Consequently, the value of 4n\u2212 5\nfor the number of faulty edges in Qkn in the statement of Theorem 10 is optimal.\n5 Conclusions\nWe end by presenting our conclusions and some open problems. Our main result is\nthat Qkn with 4n \u2212 5 faulty edges, but where every vertex is incident with at least 2\nhealthy edges, is bipancyclic, for every even k greater than or equal to 4. Ideally,\nwe would like to prove that when Qkn has 4n \u2212 5 faulty edges so that every vertex is\nincident with at least 2 healthy edges, Qkn is bipancyclic for all k \u2265 3 (no matter what\nthe parity of k). However, consider the proof of Theorem 10. There are a number of\nconstructions within that proof that have drawbacks when k is odd. For example, we\noften extend a specific cycle C, of some (even) length m, by iteratively joining it to\n(even length) Hamiltonian cycles in some k-ary (n\u2212 1)-cubes contained within Qkn so\nas to obtain healthy cycles of all even lengths from m up to kn in Qkn. When k is odd,\nthis technique cannot be applied in such an elementary way as the Hamiltonian cycles\nof the k-ary (n\u2212 1)-cubes have odd length. Alternatively, extending our cycle C with\nhealthy cycles of (even) length kn\u22121 \u2212 1 leaves us with a vertex in each such k-ary\n(n\u2212 1)-cube not contained within the resulting cycle. Also, by the same token, when\nwe extend a healthy cycle using healthy Ts,t\u2019s (as in the proof of Theorem 10), because\nk is odd we find that we have vertices not appearing on our cycles. It would appear\nthat a significant amount of extra work has to be done (and possibly new techniques\nestablished) if one wishes to prove that Qkn is bipancyclic when k is odd. The same can\nbe said as regards proving that Qkn is k-pancyclic when k is odd.\nAs remarked at the end of the previous section, Theorem 10 is optimal. The argu-\nment for optimality is that used in [2] to rule out Hamiltonian cycles in certain config-\nurations of more that 4n\u2212 5 faults in Qkn. It would be interesting to know in a situation\nwhere there are more than 4n\u2212 5 faulty edges in Qkn (and Qkn still satisfies our condi-\ntional fault assumption), whether there is an upper bound of the form kn \u2212m so that\n26\nwhen k \u2265 4 is even, there are healthy cycles of all lengths from 4 up to kn \u2212 m (of\ncourse, we would prefer that m is constant or at least a very slow growing function of\nn and possibly k). From the constructions in [2], the smallest m can be is 2.\nRelated to pancyclicity and bipancyclicity are two concepts. A graph G on n ver-\ntices is panconnected (resp. bipanconnected) if for any two distinct vertices u and v\nof G, there is a path of every length l for which dist(u, v) \u2264 l \u2264 n (resp. for which\ndist(u, v) \u2264 l \u2264 n and l and dist(u, v) have the same parity), where dist(u, v), for 2\nvertices u and v of a graph, is the length of a shortest path joining u and v. Both pan-\nconnectivity and edge-pancyclicity (resp. bipanconnectivity and edge-bipancyclicity)\nimply pancyclicity (resp. bipancyclicity). It was proven in [24] that when k \u2265 3\nand n \u2265 2, Qkn is bipannconnected and edge-bipancyclic. It would be interesting to\nknow as to whether the main result of this paper can be extended to encompass bi-\npannconnectivity or edge-bipancyclicity. However, we note that in order to prove such\nextensions, we will need radically different techniques to those employed in the proof\nof Theorem 10 which are decidedly non-uniform.\nFinally, we mention the study of pancyclicity in arbitrary graphs which has a long\nhistory. In [5], Bondy made the following \u2018meta-conjecture\u2019: Almost any non-trivial\ncondition on a graph which implies that the graph is Hamiltonian also implies that the\ngraph is pancyclic (there may be a simple family of exceptional graphs). The classical\nresult giving such a condition is Dirac\u2019s Theorem [12] that says that every graph on\nn \u2265 3 vertices that has minimum degree at least n2 is Hamiltonian, and which was\nextended by Bondy [4] who showed that the same assumptions imply that a graph is\neither Kn\n2\n,n\n2\nor pancyclic. Other conditions include: if the connectivity of a graph G\nis no less than the independence number of G and G is triangle-free then G contains\na cycle of every length from 4 up to n unless G is a cycle of length 5 or G = Kk,k,\nfor some k [21] (Erdo\u00a8s [9] had shown that if a graph is such that its connectivity is\nno less than its independence number then the graph is Hamiltonian); and if G is a\nHamiltonian graph with minimum degree at least 600 times the independence number\nof G then G is pancyclic [20]. Of course, results such as these are of no use to us when\ndealing with k-ary n-cubes but it would be interesting to study which conditions on an\narbitrary (Hamiltonian) bipartite graph force the graph to be bipancyclic.\nReferences\n[1] Y.A.
