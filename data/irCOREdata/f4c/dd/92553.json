Now I realize they are both indispensable (Gigerenzer, \n20002, p.94). \nWhile his hostility to psychology would be unusual in child protection work, his \ndesire to avoid statistics will strike a chord with many.  Once we have left school, we \nmay have little to do with numbers and, for many, there is heart-felt relief that this is \nso.  Unfortunately, numeracy is becoming a crucial skill.  Professionals using an \nevidence-based approach need to be able to understand statistics and how to apply \nthem to a particular client or family.  Risk assessment instruments, which are \nbecomingly increasingly common, pose a particular mathematical issue: if this family \nis assessed as at high risk of abuse, how likely is this result to be accurate?  \n \nWithout specific training, people given the necessary figures about an instrument\u2019s \nreliability find it surprisingly hard to work out the correct answer.  Research shows a \nhigh level of misunderstanding among medical practitioners, with a persistent bias \ntowards grossly over-estimating the accuracy of results (Casscells et al, 1978; \nGigerenzer, 2002).   These mistakes can have devastating effects on patient care.  A \nsimilar level of ignorance in child protection work could have an equally damaging \nimpact on children and parents as these instruments are more widely used in daily \npractice. \n \n 2\nPsychologists have repeatedly shown that people have a particularly poor ability to \nreason intuitively about probabilities.  Many have taken these findings as evidence of \nthe frailty of the human intellect and its vulnerability to cognitive illusions and biases \n(Tversky and Kahneman, 1974). However, research at the Max Planck Institute for \nHuman Development in Germany has found that people\u2019s reasoning is significantly \naffected by the way the information is presented and that, given the right methods, \ntheir intuitive grasp of probabilities can be significantly improved (Gigerenzer and \nSelten, 2001). This article will show how these lessons can be applied to dealing with \nthe key probability calculations in judging the reliability of a risk assessment \ninstrument. \n \n \nThe power of a diagnostic instrument \n \n \nProfessionals need to know how accurate a result is because it should effect how they \nuse it in working with a family.  If they know, for instance, that most positive results \nare, in fact, false positives, then they should treat a specific result as, at best, a \ntentative hypothesis to be tested further.  Equally, if a family is assessed as low risk \nusing an instrument where a lot of the negatives will be false, then, again, \nprofessionals should stay alert to the possibility that this benign assessment may be \nwrong. \n \nPractitioners face two obstacles in working out the reliability of a risk assessment \ninstrument, or any other diagnostic procedure.  First, the authors of the instrument \n 3\nrarely inform the reader of all the statistics needed to evaluate its accuracy.  Secondly, \nwhen they do present statistics, they usually do it in a way that is hard for the average \nperson to understand. \n \nTo evaluate accuracy, we need to know the values of three variables: \n \n(1) The sensitivity of the instrument: how many high risk families it will \nidentify accurately (the percentage of true positives); \n(2) The specificity: how many low risk families it will identify accurately \n(percentage of true negatives); \n(3) The base rate or prevalence of the phenomenon (in this case, abuse) \nbeing measured. \n \nEach of these three variables play a distinctive part in working out the overall \nusefulness of an instrument but it is the final one \u2013 the base rate \u2013 that is most often \noverlooked or misunderstood.  Put briefly, the rarer the phenomenon being assessed, \nthe harder it is to develop an instrument with a clinically useful level of accuracy.  \nConversely, the higher the prevalence, the easier it is.  Hence, researchers face a \nharder task trying to develop a risk assessment instrument to screen the general \npopulation, where the incidence of abuse is relatively low, than if their target \npopulation were specifically families known to child protection agencies, where the \nbase rate will be much higher. \n \n 4\nWhen the full set of relevant figures for an instrument are provided, they are \nusually presented in a way that is hard for anyone to follow intuitively.  (This \ncriticism applies also to my own work e.g. Munro, 2002).  \n \nThis is the way the calculation is usually presented: \n \nThe probability of a family being abusive is 20%.  If a family is abusive, the \nprobability of being identified by the instrument is 90%.  If the family is not \nabusive, the probability that they will be correctly identified is 80%.  In a case \nwhere the instrument produces a positive result, what is the probability that it \nis a true positive? \n \nExtensive research among medical practitioners has consistently found a high error \nrate in answering this type of question.  The vast majority of respondents gave a reply \nbetween 70 and 90%, which, as you will see, is a gross over-estimate of the \nprobability (Hoffrage and Gigerenzer, 1998).    \n \nIntuitive efforts to deal with problems like this are clearly very defective.  We can get \na more accurate answer by using formal probability theory but the following section \nwill probably seem even more daunting for most child protection workers. The \nanswer can be calculated by using Bayes Theorem: \n \nFigure 1 \nIn formal terms, where p(a\/t) means the probability of a positive result being a true \npositive: \n 5\nFigure 2 \n \nReaders with some statistical background will be able to follow this formula but the \nchances are that they will be few in number.  However, if we present the same \ninformation in terms of frequencies, it becomes much easier to understand and people \nare much more successful in working out the answer without using a formal theorem: \n \nTwenty out of every 100 families in this population are abusive (the base rate).  \nOf these 20 families, 18 will get a positive result on using the instrument (the \nsensitivity). Of the other 80 families, some 16 will also get a positive result \n(the specificity). Imagine the instrument has given a positive result for a group \nof families.  How many of these families with a positive result will actually be \nabusive? \n \nThe calculation can be made even clearer by using a tree diagram: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTree diagram 1 \n \n 6\nIt is easy to work out that 34 families will get a positive result, of which 18 will be \ntrue positives.  Thus the probability of a positive result being a true positive = \n \n 18    = 0.53. \n       18 + 16               \n \nThe crux of the problem is that people forget, or do not know, the importance of the \nbase rate in determining the level of false positives. This was shown in a famous \nstudy:  the Harvard Medical School Test  (Casscells et al, 1978).  Staff and students at \nHarvard Medical School were told of a diagnostic test that had a high specificity of \n95% and a superb sensitivity of 100% (no-one who had the disease would test \nnegative).  They were asked the probability of someone who tested positive actually \nhaving the disease.  As the reader of this article will now know, they cannot answer \nthis question without the additional information about the prevalence of the specific \ndisease being tested for.  However, few respondents realised this and the majority said \nthe probability was 0.95 \u2013 the rate of true positives. \n \nHIV tests provide a particularly vivid and tragic illustration of the consequences of \nthis level of professional ignorance about how to interpret test results.  Getting a \npositive HIV result is so serious that it is crucial to know how many are true and how \nmany are false positives.  Yet studies of doctors\u2019 and counsellors\u2019 knowledge reveal \nthat they have similar difficulties to the staff and students at the Harvard Medical \nSchool and many are giving patients misleading advice (Gigerenzer, 2002, p.127). \n \nHIV testing typically involves an initial ELISA test designed to detect antibodies \nagainst HIV in blood samples.  If the result is negative then the patient is notified that \nhe or she is HIV-negative.  If it is positive, then at least one more ELISA test is done \n 7\nand, if this is also positive, a Western blot test is performed.  If this is positive then \nthe patient is told that he or she is HIV-positive.  This very thorough sequence of tests \nproduces high sensitivity (99.9%) and specificity rates (99.99%).  Unfortunately, most \ndoctors and counsellors involved in the testing tell patients with a positive result that \nthe probability of a false positive is so low that it can be discounted.  However, this is \nnot necessarily true, depending on what group the patient belongs to. The base rates in \nthe following account, taken from Gigerenzer (2002), are based on German statistics. \n \nIf the patient comes from the high-risk group of homosexual men, then the base rate \nof infection is 1.5%.   Therefore the calculation is: \n \nTake a group of 10,000 homosexual men.  We expect 150 to be infected with \nthe virus, and most likely all of them will test positive (sensitivity).  Of the \n9,850 men who are not infected, we expect that 1 will test positive \n(specificity).  Thus, we have 151 men who test positive, of who 150 have the \nvirus.  A patient\u2019s chances of not having the virus, given a positive result, are \n1 out of 151, that is, less than 1%. \n \nTree diagram 2 \n \nHowever, if the patient is from a low risk group, with none of the known risk factors \napplying, then the conclusion is very different.  For this group, the base rate was \n0.01% - one in 10,000: \n \n 8\nTake a group of 10,000 men who are not in any known risk category.  We \nwould expect 1 to be infected and he will test positive with practical certainty. \nOf the 9,999 men who are not infected, we expect that another one will also \ntest positive. Thus, we have 2 men with positive results, only one of whom is \ninfected.  If a patient has a positive result, his chances of not having the virus \nare 50\/50. \n \nTree diagram 3 \n \nGigerenzer (2002, p.127) reports that one of his students volunteered to check what \ninformation was given to patients before being tested for HIV.  He visited twenty \npublic health centres in Germany, presenting himself as someone who had no known \nrisk factors for HIV, and had  pre-test counselling.  This is mandatory in Germany and \nstaff are responsible for explaining the reliability of the result before the test is \nperformed.  The student specifically asked what were the chances of men in his risk \ngroup (very low risk) actually having HIV given a positive result.  Ten counsellors \ntold him it was absolutely certain that it was a true positive.  Five said it was 99.9% \ncertain.  Two avoided answering his questions and three gave estimates above 90 but \nbelow 99.9%.  None gave anything like the correct answer of 50%. \n \nImplications in child protection work \n \nIncreasingly, child protection agencies are adopting risk assessment instruments \n(Wald and Woolverton, 1990; Lyons et al, 1996; Baird et al, 1999).  They may be \nused at several different stages. Some are designed to screen the general population to \n 9\nidentify potentially abusive parents so that preventive measures can be offered. Some \nhelp agency staff decide how to respond to an initial allegation of abuse, i.e. how \nseriously and urgently the referral is dealt with (Johnson and Clancy, 1988; Wells and \nAnderson, 1992; Zuravin et al, 1995).  Others assess which of the families already \nknown to the agency are high or low risk and the findings inform the allocation of \nresources or other aspects of the management of the case (Lyons et al, 1996).  \n \nThe existing literature on risk assessment instruments does not give sufficient \ninformation to let the reader work out the accuracy of an instrument.  Some merely \ngive a single statistic on accuracy, saying, for instance, an instrument has a 65% \ndegree of accuracy (e.g. Johnson, 1996).  Others provide more detail and tell the \nreader the sensitivity and the specificity (Lyons, et al, 1996).  However, information \nabout the base rate is usually missing.  Yet, as the earlier discussion showed, base \nrates are a crucial part of working out how reliable any result is.  How big a difference \nthey can make was seen in the HIV example but let me also illustrate it in child \nprotection work.  Because of the difficulties of getting accurate statistics on the \nincidence of abuse, I have made an educated estimate of base rates in the following \nexamples.  \n \nZuravin et al (1995) report an instrument for screening initial referrals \u2013 deciding \nwhether or not they warrant further investigation - with a sensitivity of 69% and a \nspecificity of 74%.  Besharov (1990) estimates that the number of referrals that are \nsubstantiated as cases of abuse is between 35 and 45%.  Taking the average, let us \nassume a base rate of 40% and calculate the probability that a positive result on this \ninstrument will be a true positive. \n 10\n \nIn a group of 1,000 families, we would expect that 400 would be abusive.  Of \nthese 400 families, 276 will get a positive result on using the instrument \n(sensitivity 69%).  Of the other 600 families, 156 will also get a positive result \n(specificity 74%).  Therefore, there will be a total of 432 positive results, of \nwhich 276 will be true positives. \nTree  diagram 4 \n \nThe probability of a positive result being a true positive = \n \n            276     =  0.64 \n       276+156 \n \nLet us now consider how an instrument with the same sensitivity and specificity \nwould perform if used on a sample with a much lower base rate \u2013 say, as a screening \nof the general population.  Corby (1993, p.53), using the numbers of children on child \nprotection registers in England, estimated a prevalence of 4 per thousand, 0.4%. \n \nIf we take a group of 1,000 families, we expect that 4 will be abusive.  Of \nthese 4 families, 3 approximately will get a positive result on using the \ninstrument (sensitivity 69%).  Of the other 996 families, 259 will also get a \npositive result (specificity 74%).  Therefore, there will be a total of 262 \npositive results, of which 3 will be true positives. \n \n \n \n \n 11\nTree diagram 5 \n \nThe probability of a positive result being a true positive = \n \n                  3     =  0.12  \n    3+259 \n \nIn both cases, the accuracy is far lower than most people expect intuitively from being \ntold just the sensitivity and specificity and it has serious practice implications.  If we \nare screening the general population, an instrument with this degree of reliability \nwould identify a very large group of families as potentially abusive, but only a tiny \npercentage would be true positives.  Therefore, if an agency used such an instrument \nas the basis for providing preventive services, it would need generous resources to \nmeet the identified need.  At the same time, it would have to recognise that about a \nquarter of dangerous families were being overlooked.   \n \nIn screening initial referrals, the probability of a positive result being accurate is \nconsiderably higher (0.64) but this is still far below certainty.  This has implications \nfor how professionals should use it. If it is mistakenly taken as highly reliable, then it \nwill affect how professionals work with a family, what information they seek, and \nhow they interpret it. There is overwhelming evidence from psychology that, once \npeople have formed a judgement about a person or family, they are slow to change \ntheir minds.  They tend to be selective in what they notice and in how they interpret \nnew information to fit with their existing judgement  (Kahneman et al, 1990).  \nTherefore, professionals who put too much trust in the result of an instrument will be \nbiased towards confirming it, paying attention to the evidence, for example, that \nsupports the claim that the family is high risk and being slow to see the significance of \n 12\ncounter evidence.  Conversely, if they conclude firmly that a family is low risk, they \nwill be biased against new evidence that should cause concern.  Many of the deaths of \nchildren known to child protection agencies have arisen in circumstances where those \nin close contact with the parents had decided that all was going well and were blind to \nevidence that, with hindsight, looks overwhelming (Munro, 1999).  \n \nA critical mindset is needed in using the results of risk assessment instruments. \nWhatever judgement is made about the level of risk to a child, professionals need to \nremember this is a hypothesis, not a certain truth, and to keep it under constant, \ncritical review.   The individual professional, however, needs to work in an agency \nculture that allows and encourages this approach.  Supervisors play a key role in \nhelping front line workers stand back to reflect on and critique their reasoning.  \nUnfortunately, access to good casework supervision is becoming scarce (Rushton and \nNathan, 1996).  Managers\u2019 priority can be to supervise the administrative process, \nensuring that all legal and procedural rules have been followed.   \n \nThis is, in part, due to the rise of defensive practice.  In both USA and the UK, the \npublic and media have played a large part in shaping child protection priorities.  \nOutrage at children\u2019s deaths at the hands of their carers has been directed at the \nprofessionals, especially the social workers, who have the duty of protecting children \n(Waldfogel, 1998; Parton, Thorpe & Wattam, 1997).  This pressure has led agencies \nto increase the level of investigations to minimise the chances that a child will \nmistakenly be left in danger.  However, in an area with such imperfect knowledge, \nour ability to predict which parents will seriously harm their children is extremely \nlimited.  The public desire for safety cannot be met.   \n 13\n \nAgencies, realising that the risk of child deaths cannot be wholly removed, may take \nsteps to protect themselves. They may try to transfer or dissipate blame by engaging \nin \u2018blame prevention re-engineering\u2019 (Hood, Rothstein and Baldwin, 2000).  Hood et \nal\u2019s research found that one strategy for doing this is \u2018protocolozation\u2019: the \norganisation introduces more and more formal procedures to guide practice so that \nthey create a \u2018correct\u2019 way to deal with a case. Then, if a tragedy occurs, they can \nclaim the defence of \u2018due diligence\u2019 and show that their employees followed these \ncorrect procedures in working on the case.  A child may have died but the agency \nstaff can show a clear audit trail of what they did and cannot be faulted for the tragic \noutcome.  This defence certainly seems to be operating in the UK where recent \ninquiries into the deaths of children known to child protection agencies appear to \nfocus more on whether procedures were followed than whether competent \nprofessional judgements and decisions were made (Cambridgeshire County Council, \n1997; Norfolk Health Authority, 2002). \n \nUnfortunately, if such a defensive culture exists, it is in the agency\u2019s interests to act as \nif the results of a formal assessment instrument are certain.  They provide a clear basis \nfor management of the case and removes problems associated with individual \nprofessional competence.  There is a \u2018right\u2019 way to respond which can be proven to \nanyone investigating the agency.  In a defensive culture, the protection of the agency \ncan start to dominate over the protection of children.   \n \n \n 14\nConclusion \n \nIn the past, professionals generally relied upon their own expert judgement in judging \nthe level of risk but child protection agencies are increasingly introducing risk \nassessment instruments to inform and support decisions about service response.  Some \nway of categorising cases into high risk and low risk groups is necessary.   Intruding \ninto the privacy of the family can only be justified in a liberal society by serious \nconcern for the rights and welfare of the child.  Also, agency resources are limited and \nall families cannot be offered a service even if they wanted to receive help.     \n \nIntroducing formal instruments as an aid has many advantages.  There is evidence that \nit leads to a more consistent and, so, more equitable response (Baird et al, 1999).  It is \nalso likely that actuarial instruments that use formal statistics to compute the answer \nare more accurate than clinical judgement.  There is little evidence on this specifically \nin relation to child protection but all the evidence from other fields where comparison \nhas been made between actuarial and clinical judgement is strongly weighted in \nfavour of actuarial (Grove and Meehl, 1996).  This should not surprise us since people \ngenerally have difficulty in working out probability calculations and these instruments \nproduce a large set of data to weigh.  Paul Meehl, the psychologist, gives the analogy: \n \nSurely we all know that the human brain is poor at weighting and computing.  \nWhen you check out at a supermarket, you don\u2019t eyeball the heap of purchases \nand say to the clerk, \u201cWell it looks to me as if it\u2019s about $17.00 worth; what \ndo you think?\u201d The clerk adds it up (Meehl, 1986, p.372). \n \n 15\nJust as the clerk does not hesitate to use an adding machine, the child protection \nworker should not be reluctant to use an actuarial method to calculate the overall \nweight of the various risk factors.   \n \nHowever, the number obtained at the end of the calculation needs to be viewed with \nrealistic caution.  Numbers have an air of authority and objectivity that can mislead \npeople into crediting them with more accuracy than they deserve.  The aim of this \narticle has not been to criticise the use of instruments but to caution against over-\nconfidence in their results. If the rate of true and false positives is understood, then \nclearly, the conclusion should be treated tentatively and practitioners should continue \nto keep an open mind about its accuracy.  The examples used in this article show how \neven an instrument with reasonably good sensitivity and specificity can produce large \nnumbers of false positives and false negatives, depending on the base rate in the \npopulation in question.  An additional cautionary note is that the relevant statistics are \nnot known for many instruments or, if available, are to some degree estimates rather \nthan confident assertions. The formal probability calculation can be impressive and \ninspire confidence but the reader should remember that it is being used on imperfect \nstatistics. \n \nHuman beings seem to have a persistent yearning for certainty (Gigernenzer, 2002).  \nRisk assessment instruments that make mathematical calculations based on the best \nempirical evidence may well be the best way of assessing the level of danger to a \nchild but their conclusions carry no magical guarantee of truth.   Professionals need to \nknow how to ask questions about the level of accuracy and to understand the \nimplications the answers have in terms of ratios of true and false positives and true \n 16\nand false negatives.  Agencies and the public need to accept that professional \njudgements and decisions, even when based on the best evidence and the best way of \ncomputing the evidence, are fallible.  On-going work with a family needs to be \nundertaken knowing that the current risk assessment is only a best estimate and may \nneed to be revised in the light of new information. \n \nThe shift to evidence-based practice represents a move from an appeal to authority or \ntradition to an appeal to evidence gained from empirical research (Gambrill, 2001).  \nUnless practitioners have sufficient numeracy skills to assess the evidence \nthemselves, there is a danger of replacing the authority of the clinical expert with a \nmisguidedly exaggerated deference to the scientific expert.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17\nFigures for \u2018A simpler way to understand the results of risk assessment \ninstruments\u2019 \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \nProbability of a    = sensitivity x base rate\n   True positive           probability of a positive result \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \nP(a\/t) = p(t\/a) p(a)\n            P(t) \n \nTree diagram 1 \n \n \n100 families \n \n   20 abusive   80 not abusive \n            \n        18             2   16  64 \n     Positive result   negative result      positive result   negative result \n \n \nTree diagram 2 \n \n10,000 men \n \n \n \n   150 infected   9,850 not infected \n            \n \n   \n        150             0   1  9,849 \n     positive result   negative result      positive result   negative result \n 18\n \nTree diagram 3 \n \n10,000 men \n \n \n \n   1 infected   9,999 not infected \n            \n \n   \n        1                         0   1    9,998 \n     positive result   negative result      positive result   negative result \n \n \n \nTree diagram 4 \n \n1000 families \n \n \n \n   400 abusive   600 not abusive \n            \n \n   \n        276             124   156      444 \n     positive result   negative result      positive result   negative result \n \n \n \n \nTree diagram 5 \n \n1000 families \n \n \n \n   4 abusive   996 not abusive \n            \n \n   \n        3                        1   259        737 \n     positive result   negative result      positive result   negative result \n \n \n \n \n 19\nReferences \n \nBaird C., Wagner D., Healy T. & Johnson K.
