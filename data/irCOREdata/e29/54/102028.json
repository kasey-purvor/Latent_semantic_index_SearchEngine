If the inviscid equation admits a base flow in which\ndifferent fluid regions are divided by separatrices, then transport between these regions is af-\nforded by the splitting of separatrices caused by viscous dissipation. Finite-time Melnikov theory\nallows us to measure the splitting distance of separatrices provided the perturbed velocity field\nof the viscous fluid flow stays sufficiently close to vorticity-conserving base flow over sufficiently\nlong time intervals. In this paper, we derive the necessary long-term estimates of solutions to\nEuler\u2019s equation and to the barotropic vorticity equation upon adding viscous perturbations\nand forcing. We discover that a certain stability condition on the unperturbed flow is sufficient\nto guarantee these long time estimates.\n1\n1 Introduction\nQuestions concerning the impact of adding viscosity and forcing to inviscid fluid flow arise naturally\nbut are usually not simple to resolve due to the technical complications of the inviscid limit. One\nsuch question can be cast in terms of the Cauchy problem for two-dimensional flow: does the\nsolution of the perturbed initial value problem, i.e. of the viscous forced equation, stay close for\nall, or very long, time to that of the unperturbed, i.e. inviscid and unforced, problem with the\nsame initial value. Basic results (see, for instance [3, 10]) render results of the form: for a fixed\ntime interval [0, T ] and under appropriate conditions on the unperturbed flow field, the viscous flow\nwill tend, in an appropriate norm and at the rate of the perturbation parameter \u00b2, to the inviscid\nflow. The condition on the unperturbed flow is a regularity condition that relates to the absence of\nsingularities, such as point vortices; results in the context of singular inviscid flows yield a weaker\nrate of convergence, see [19].\nA natural question arises as to whether these results can be improved upon by imposing extra\nconditions on the unperturbed flow field. Of particular focus here is whether the time interval T\nfor convergence as \u00b2\u2192 0 can be related to \u00b2, i.e. whether T = T\u00b2 and T\u00b2 \u2192\u221e as \u00b2\u2192 0. Our main\nresult is that, with an appropriate stability condition on an unperturbed steady flow, a significant\nimprovement can be made. Although the classical results are not stated in this way, it is not hard\nto obtain T\u00b2 \u223c | ln \u00b2|, and our main result improves upon this, under our stability conditions, to\nhave T\u00b2 \u223c \u00b2\u2212\u03ba for some \u03ba > 0.\nOur specific motivation for considering this issue comes from a study of fluid transport in ocean\nflows. Models of basic ocean flows exhibiting features such as eddies or meandering jets are often\ngiven in terms of steady flow fields of inviscid Euler equations. Recent developments in dynamical\nsystems ideas in the context of fluid flows have afforded an understanding of the fluid exchange\nbetween constituent parts of such a feature. It is well-known that even a simple two-dimensional\nfluid flow that is time-dependent can exhibit significant fluid exchange among the various flow\nregimes within features as well as between the feature and the ambient water. This phenomenon\nwas cited by Samelson [14] as an explanation of the irregularity observed in float data in the North\nAtlantic. This work relies on the fact that the \u03b2-plane approximation to the Coriolis force added\nto the Euler equations can lead to a model with a jet that propagates in an easterly direction.\nSuch a jet can be viewed as a simple model of such planetary jets as the Gulf Stream. This kind of\nbase flow is, however, steady and hence exhibits no (chaotic) transport or mixing. Time-dependent\nperturbations will induce variations in the flow field that can \u201copen\u201d up avenues of fluid transport\nthrough breaking stable and unstable manifolds.\nTime-dependence of the flow field is often put in artificially by making an appropriate parameter\nin the stream function depend on time. A much more satisfying approach is to take a simple model\nas a solution of the appropriate partial differential equation (PDE) and add physical effects to the\nmodel through embellishing the PDE accordingly. Through such an approach, we can then start to\nask which physical effects might promote transport and in what ways. The underlying motivation\nfor the work at hand is then to assess the influence of viscosity and forcing on the possibility and\n2\nextent of fluid transport.\n1.1 Motivation: Transport in two-dimensional fluid flows\nOf interest then is the effect of viscous dissipation and forcing on two-dimensional vorticity con-\nserving flows. The potential vorticity q\u03b5(t, x, y) of the fluid satisfies the PDE\n\u2202tq\n\u03b5 + {\u03c8\u03b5, q\u03b5} = \u03b5 [\u2206q\u03b5 + f(t, x, y)] (1.1)\nwhere\n{f, g} = \u2202f\n\u2202x\n\u2202g\n\u2202y\n\u2212 \u2202g\n\u2202y\n\u2202g\n\u2202x\n(1.2)\ndenotes the usual Poisson bracket. We think of the small parameter 0 < \u03b5\u00bf 1 as a measure of the\namount of viscous dissipation and forcing added to the vorticity-conserving equation. The stream\nfunction \u03c8\u03b5 and the potential vorticity q\u03b5 are related by\nq\u03b5 = \u2206\u03c8\u03b5 + \u03b2y\nwhere the term involving \u03b2 accounts for the Coriolis force. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume\nthroughout this paper that (1.1) is posed on the torus T2 to avoid complications due to boundaries.\nTransport in the fluid is described by the ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nd\ndt\n(\nx\ny\n)\n= u\u03b5(t, x, y) (1.3)\nthat governs the dynamics of particles via their position (x, y)(t), where the term u\u03b5(t, x, y) on the\nright-hand side is the velocity field associated with the stream function \u03c8\u03b5(t, x, y) via\nu\u03b5(t, x, y) = J\u2207\u03c8\u03b5(t, x, y), J =\n(\n0 \u22121\n1 0\n)\n.\nWe begin by discussing the unperturbed situation when \u03b5 = 0. Since the PDE (1.1) then conserves\nvorticity, the ODE (1.3) behaves as if it were an autonomous integrable Hamiltonian system [3, 5].\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFigure 1: The dynamics of (1.3) in the (x, y)-space is illustrated. The center plot (ii) shows\ntrajectories when the vorticity-conserving base flow has a bounded recirculating region formed by two\nseparatrices. Two different ways in which these separatrices may potentially break upon adding small\nviscous dissipation are illustrated in (i) and (iii): the left figure exhibits chaotic transport, while the\nright figure illustrates uni-directional fluid exchange.\n3\nAs a consequence, the unstable and stable manifolds of stagnation points will either coincide or\nnot intersect at all. In particular, as shown in Figure 1(ii), heteroclinic loops may form that\nseparate regions inside the fluid from the ambient fluid, thus precluding particle exchange between\nthese regions and the ambient fluid. Upon allowing small viscous dissipation and forcing so that\n0 < \u03b5 \u00bf 1, the heteroclinic loop may break so that the formerly separated regions inside and\noutside of the loop can exchange fluid particles. Figure 1(i) illustrates the situation where the\nstable and unstable manifolds intersect transversely for \u03b5 > 0, thus leading to chaotic transport\nbetween adjacent fluid regions [12]. An alternative case, which leads to uni-directional transport\nacross the formerly isolated spatial region, is shown in Figure 1(iii).\nMelnikov theory can be used to predict which of these two cases occurs by allowing us to compute\nthe splitting distance between stable and unstable manifolds via the Melnikov integral. To apply\nstandard Melnikov theory, we need to know the perturbed velocity field u\u03b5(t, x, y) explicitly to\nevaluate the Melnikov integral, and we have to show that u\u03b5(t, x, y) is close, for all times, to the\nfluid flow u0(t, x, y) for \u03b5 = 0. The second requirement is certainly unrealistic as the PDE (1.1) is\nparabolic for \u03b5 > 0 so that solutions will, in general, not even exist in backward time. Computing the\nvelocity field u\u03b5(t, x, y) as a solution to (1.1) also appears to be difficult. We now briefly summarize\nthe results in [3, 15] where we overcame these difficulties by developing a Melnikov theory for\nfinite-time vector fields and showed that the Melnikov integral for (1.3) can be calculated without\nknowing the perturbed velocity field.\nWe assume that the stream function \u03c80(t, x, y) is a travelling wave so that \u03c80(t, x, y) = \u03a80(x\u2212ct, y)\nfor some c \u2208 R and some smooth function \u03a80(\u03be, \u03b7). When rewritten using the variables (\u03be, \u03b7) =\n(x\u2212 ct, y), equation (1.3) becomes autonomous. We assume that the transformed equation has, for\n\u03b5 = 0, a trajectory (\u03be\u00af, \u03b7\u00af)(t) = (x\u00af(t)\u2212 ct, y\u00af(t)) that is homoclinic to the hyperbolic saddle (\u03be\u221e, \u03b7\u221e).\nSince we assumed that (1.1) is posed on T2, heteroclinic orbits can, in many cases, accommodated\nas well upon using periodicity in space, and we refer to [3, \u00a75] for a discussion of this point. The\nfollowing hypothesis is crucial for our finite-time Melnikov theory.\nHypothesis 1 We assume that the difference u\u03b5(t, x, y) \u2212 u0(t, x, y) of the inviscid and viscid\nvelocity fields of (1.1) is defined for every \u03b5 \u2208 [0, \u03b50) and that, for appropriate numbers \u03ba > 0,\nC > 0 and \u03bd \u2208 (12 , 1], we have\n|u\u03b5(t, x, y)\u2212 u0(t, x, y)|+ |\u2207(u\u03b5(t, x, y)\u2212 u0(t, x, y))| \u2264 C\u03b5\u03bd (1.4)\nuniformly in 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03b5\u2212\u03ba and (x, y) \u2208 T2.\nThe following theorem gives the desired expression for the splitting distance that has been used in\n[3, 15] to predict the nature of transport for 0 < \u03b5\u00bf 1.\nTheorem 1 ([15]) Under the assumptions given above, the splitting distance of stable and unstable\nmanifolds of (1.3) measured in the time slice t = \u03c4 is given by \u03b5M(\u03c4, \u03b5) where\nM(\u03c4, \u03b5) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n[\u2206q0(t, x\u00af(t), y\u00af(t))\u2212\u2206q0(t, x\u00af\u221e + ct, y\u00af\u221e)] dt (1.5)\n4\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n[f(t+ \u03c4, x\u00af(t), y\u00af(t))\u2212 f(t+ \u03c4, x\u00af\u221e + ct, y\u00af\u221e)] dt+O(\u03b52\u03bd\u22121)\nuniformly in \u03c4 \u2208 [\u03bd\u03b8 | ln \u03b5|, \u03b5\u2212\u03ba \u2212 \u03bd\u03b8 | ln \u03b5|], where \u03b8 is the positive eigenvalue of J\u2207\u03a80(\u03be\u221e, \u03b7\u221e).\nInspecting the Melnikov integral (1.5), we see that viscous dissipation alone leads to uni-directional\ntransport as shown in Figure 1(iii), while genuinely time-dependent forcing may create chaotic\ntransport as shown in Figure 1(i). We refer to [3, \u00a78] for more details.\n1.2 Goal: Long-term estimates\nTo apply Theorem 1, we need to establish the inequality (1.4) which requires an estimate of \u03c8\u03b5\u2212\u03c80\nthat is valid for time intervals of length \u03b5\u2212\u03ba. From a PDE viewpoint, this raises the interesting\nquestion of long-time estimates for solutions of viscous and inviscid equations.\nTo explain this issue, we consider, as the simplest possible model, the two-dimensional Euler equa-\ntion\n\u2202tu\n0 + (u0 \u00b7 \u2207)u0 +\u2207p0 = 0, \u2207 \u00b7 u0 = 0, (1.6)\nand the Navier\u2013Stokes equation\n\u2202tu\n\u03b5 + (u\u03b5 \u00b7 \u2207)u\u03b5 +\u2207p\u03b5 = \u03b5[\u2206u\u03b5 + f ], \u2207 \u00b7 u\u03b5 = 0 (1.7)\nwith small viscosity and a smooth bounded forcing term f(t, x, y). In both equations, we consider\nu\u03b5(t, x, y) \u2208 R2 with (x, y) in the two-dimensional torus T2. As usual in the periodic setting, we\nshall consider flows u0 and u\u03b5 that have zero mean on T2, hence we shall also assume that\n\u222b\nT2 f = 0.\nDue to this last assumption, we can indeed express the velocity field u\u03b5(t, x, y) via u\u03b5 = J\u2207\u03c8\u03b5 in\nterms of a scalar stream function \u03c8\u03b5(t, x, y). The vorticity \u03c9\u03b5(t, x, y) defined by \u03c9\u03b5 = \u2206\u03c8\u03b5 = \u2207\u2227u\u03b5\nwill also play an important role in the analysis presented below, where \u2207\u2227 u := det[\u2207, u].\nIf us(x, y) is a stationary solution of (1.6), then the solution of (1.7) with initial condition us satisfies\nthe estimate\n\u2016u\u03b5(t)\u2212 us\u2016H1(T2) \u2264 \u03b5Ceat (1.8)\nfor certain numbers a > 0 and C > 0, and we therefore have, for each 0 < \u03b3 < 1, that\n\u2016u\u03b5 \u2212 us\u2016H1(T2) \u2264 \u03b5\u03b3 \u2200t \u2208 [0, T\u03b5] (1.9)\nwhere T\u03b5 \u223c | ln \u03b5|. The standard estimate (1.8) does not use any particular property of us and is\ntrue even if us is a bounded time-dependent solution of the Euler equation.\nWe expect that T\u03b5 will much larger when us is a linearly stable solution. A formal explanation\ngoes as follows. If we set u = u\u03b5\u2212us and neglect viscosity and nonlinear effects in the equation for\nu, we obtain a linear PDE of the form\n\u2202tu = Au+ \u03b5F (t, x, y), u(0, x, y) = 0 (1.10)\n5\nwhere A is the linearization of Euler\u2019s equation about us, and F = \u2207 \u2227 f + \u2206us. We consider\n(1.10) on the space Hmdf (T2) of functions in Hm(T2) with \u2207\u00b7u = 0. Suppose now that us is a stable\nsolution and that we can prove an estimate of the form\n\u2016eAt\u2016L(H1df(T2)) \u2264 C \u2200t \u2265 0\nfor some C > 0, then the mild solution\nu(t) = \u03b5\n\u222b t\n0\neA(t\u2212s)F (s) ds (1.11)\nof (1.10) satisfies the estimate \u2016u(t)\u2016H1(T2) \u2264 \u03b5Ct. Consequently, (1.9) is true for any 0 < \u03b3 < 1\nover time intervals of length T\u03b5 \u223c \u03b5\u03b3\u22121. Furthermore, if us is weakly unstable so that\n\u2016eAt\u2016L(H1df(T2)) \u2264 Ct \u2200t \u2265 0, (1.12)\nthen the mild solution (1.11) of (1.10) satisfies \u2016u(t)\u2016H1(T2) \u2264 \u03b5Ct2, and (1.9) holds for T\u03b5 \u223c \u03b5(\u03b3\u22121)\/2\nwhich is good enough for (1.4) provided we choose \u03b3 subject to 1\/2 < \u03b3 < 1.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we establish rigorously an estimate like\n(1.12) under appropriate assumptions on us(x, y) which are related to the Energy-Casimir approach\nto fluid stability due to Arnold [2]. In fact, we establish (1.12) in the equivalent L2-norm of the\nvorticity. Next, we show that this estimate holds uniformly in the presence of vanishing viscosity\nand, building on this mild linear growth, we establish higher-order, weighted estimates for the full\nnonlinear equation (1.7) for \u03b5 > 0 to prove that Hypothesis 1 is satisfied by this class of stationary\nflows us(x, y). We show in Sections 3 and 4 that these results apply also to the two-dimensional\n\u03b2-barotropic equation (1.1) and to modified Navier\u2013Stokes equations for certain nonlinear viscosity\nstress tensors. In particular, in Section 3, we check Hypothesis 1 for the Rossby waves. Lastly, we\nsummarize our results in Section 5.\n2 The Euler and Navier\u2013Stokes equations\nThroughout this paper, we assume that\n\u222b\nT2 f = 0 and consider only fluid flows with vanishing\nspatial average. In particular, we assume that us(x, y) is a smooth stationary solution of (1.6)\nwith zero mean. We use the notation H\u02dam(T2) := {\u03c9 \u2208 Hm(T2); \u222bT2 \u03c9 = 0}, and shall denote the\nL2-norm and the L2-scalar product on T2 by\n\u2016u\u20162 = \u3008u, u\u3009, \u3008u, v\u3009 = 1\n4pi2\n\u222b 2pi\n0\n\u222b 2pi\n0\nu(x, y) \u00b7 v(x, y) dxdy.\nLastly, various different constants that do not depend on \u03b5 are denoted by C.\n2.1 Linear inviscid stability: The Euler equation\nWe begin by recalling Arnold\u2019s approach [2] to nonlinear stability of stationary solutions of the\nEuler equation. The stream function \u03c8s of any stationary solution of (1.6) is a function of the\n6\nvorticity \u03c9s = \u2206\u03c8s so that\n\u03c8s(x, y) = \u03a6(\u03c9s(x, y)), (x, y) \u2208 T2 (2.1)\nfor some, possibly multi-valued, function \u03a6. We assume that \u03a6 is single-valued and smooth. The\nclassical approach [2, 9] for checking linear stability is to use the Hamiltonian structure of the Euler\nequation: consider the constrained Hamiltonian\nH(u) =\n\u222b\nT2\n( |u|2\n2\n+G(\u03c9)\n)\ndxdy\nwhere G is an anti-derivative of \u03a6 = G\u2032. The stationary solution us is a critical point of H so that\nDH(us) = 0. Furthermore, the second variation\nD2H(us)[u, u] =\n\u222b\nT2\n(|u|2 +G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s)\u03c92) dxdy\nis conserved by the linearized Euler equation\n\u2202tu+ (us \u00b7 \u2207)u+ (u \u00b7 \u2207)us +\u2207p = 0, \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0. (2.2)\nThus, we can conclude linear stability of us for perturbations with vorticity in L2 provided the\nquadratic form D2H(us) is a norm. According to [2], this is true\n(i) if G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s) \u2265 0, or\n(ii) if there are positive numbers ` and K such that G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s) \u2264 \u2212K and the Poincare\u00b4 inequality\n\u2016u\u2016 \u2264 [K \u2212 `] \u2016\u03c9\u2016 holds.\nThe first condition is related to the classical inflexion-point theorem of Rayleigh and Fjortoft [6, 13].\nAlthough this method provides interesting results in various geometric settings (we refer to [2] or\nthe book [11] for a survey), we see that the only stationary fluid flows on T2 that satisfy either\none of the above conditions are the constant flows. Indeed, following Andrew\u2019s argument [1], we\ndifferentiate (2.1) with respect to i = x, y, multiply by \u2202i\u03c9s and integrate by parts to get the\nidentity \u222b\nT2\n[\nG\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s)(\u2202i\u03c9s)2 + |\u2202ius|2\n]\ndxdy = 0\nfor i = x, y. It is now easy to see that us is constant whenever any one of the above two conditions\nis met. Thus, in our setting, we need to relax Condition (ii) to allow more interesting fluid flows.\nAssociated with the quadratic form D2H(us) is a symmetric linear operator L via\nD2H(us)[u, u] = N (\u03c9) = \u3008\u03c9,L\u03c9\u3009\nwhich is, in fact, given by\nL\u03c9 = \u2212G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s)\u03c9 +\u2206\u22121\u03c9, (2.3)\nwhere \u2206\u22121 is the operator defined by the Fourier series\n\u2206\u22121\u03c9 = \u2212\n\u2211\n(k,l) 6=(0,0)\n\u03c9\u02c6k,l\nk2 + l2\neikx+ily\n7\non the Hilbert space L\u02da2(T2). Note that L is bounded and self-adjoint on L\u02da2(T2). We remark out\nthat L is not the linearization about us of the Euler equation in vorticity form. However, there is\na simple expression which relates the linearized equation (2.2) in vorticity form and the operator\nL: Due to (2.1), we have\n\u2202t\u03c9 = \u2212 (us \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s) = \u2212 (\u2202y\u03c9s \u2202x(L\u03c9)\u2212 \u2202x\u03c9s \u2202y(L\u03c9))\nso that\n\u2202t\u03c9 = {\u03c9s,L\u03c9}, (2.4)\nwhere we used the Poisson bracket (1.2). In general, the spectra of L, which is a bounded self-\nadjoint operator, and the linearized Euler equation in vorticity form given by (2.4) are not related.\nNevertheless, the spectrum of L is useful in order to relax Condition (ii).\nSince L is self-adjoint, its spectrum is real. Furthermore, since L is a compact perturbation\nof the bounded multiplication operator \u03c9 7\u2192 \u2212G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s)\u03c9, the essential spectrum \u03a3ess of L is\ngiven by [\u2212 supG\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s),\u2212 inf G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s)]. Consequently, if we assume that G\u2032\u2032 \u2264 \u2212K, we obtain\n\u03a3ess(L) \u2282 [K,\u221e), and the spectrum of L in (\u2212\u221e,K) consists only of isolated eigenvalues with\nfinite multiplicity. Condition (ii) implies that the spectrum of L is, in fact, contained in [`,\u221e)\nwhere ` > 0. We shall relax Condition (ii) by allowing the situation where the smallest eigenvalue\nof L is equal to zero. More precisely, we assume that the following hypothesis is met.\nHypothesis 2 We assume that G\u2032\u2032(\u03c9s) \u2264 \u2212K for some K > 0 and that zero is a semi-simple\neigenvalue of L. Using the orthogonal decomposition\nL\u02da2(T2) = N(L)\u2295 R(L), P : L\u02da2(T2) \u2212\u2192 R(L),\nwhere N(L) = span{\u03c91, . . . , \u03c9n}, we assume that there is an ` > 0 such that\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9L\u03c9 \u2265 `\u2016\u03c9\u20162 \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 R(L). (2.5)\nRoughly speaking, Hypothesis 2 says that the functional N (\u03c9) = \u3008\u03c9,L\u03c9\u3009 is semi-positive definite.\nThe main result of this section states that Hypothesis 2 implies that us is at most algebraically\nunstable.\nProposition 1 Assume that Hypothesis 2 is met, then there exists a positive constant C such that\nany solution \u03c9(t) of (2.4) with \u03c9(0, x, y) = \u03c90(x, y) satisfies the estimate\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016 \u2264 C(1 + t)\u2016\u03c90\u2016 \u2200t \u2265 0.\nProof. We use the decomposition\n\u03c9(t, \u00b7) =\nn\u2211\nj=1\naj(t)\u03c9j(\u00b7) + \u03c9\u02dc(t, \u00b7)\n8\nof \u03c9 given by Hypothesis 2, where \u03c9\u02dc = P\u03c9 is the orthogonal projection of \u03c9 onto R(L). Projecting\n(2.4) orthogonally onto R(L), we obtain\n\u2202t\u03c9\u02dc = P{\u03c9s,L\u03c9\u02dc},\nand therefore\n1\n2\nd\ndt\nN (\u03c9\u02dc) = 1\n2\nd\ndt\n\u3008\u03c9,L\u03c9\u3009 = \u3008L\u03c9\u02dc, P{\u03c9s,L\u03c9\u02dc}\u3009 = \u3008L\u03c9\u02dc, {\u03c9s,L\u03c9\u02dc}\u3009 = 0\nsince {f, {f, g}} = 0 for any two smooth functions f and g. Thus, using (2.5), we see that there is\na constant C > 0 such that\n`\u2016P\u03c9(t)\u20162 \u2264 N (\u03c9\u02dc(t)) = N (\u03c9\u02dc0) \u2264 C\u2016\u03c90\u20162. (2.6)\nNext, projecting (2.4) orthogonally onto \u03c9j , we obtain the equation\ndaj\ndt\n(t) = \u3008{\u03c9s,LP\u03c9}, \u03c9j\u3009\nfor aj which, upon integrating by parts, gives\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223dajdt (t)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 C\u2016P\u03c9(t)\u2016 \u2264 C\u2016\u03c90\u2016.\nIntegrating this equation over time from zero to t, and using combining the result with (2.6) then\ngives the desired estimate.\nLastly, we give an example that satisfies Hypothesis 2.\nExample 1 Consider the fluid flow defined by the stream function\n\u03c8s(x, y) = A sin(x+ a) +B sin(y + b) (2.7)\non T2. We have \u03a6(X) = \u2212X and therefore L = 1 +\u2206\u22121. The spectrum of L consists entirely of\neigenvalues given by\n\u03bbkl = 1\u2212 1\nk2 + l2\n, (k, l) \u2208 Z2 \\ {(0, 0)},\nand the null space of L is spanned by {cosx, sinx, cos y, sin y}. In particular, Hypothesis 2 is true\nthanks to Fourier-series expansions.\nNote that the fluid flows in Example 1 exhibit closed stream lines, see Figure 2, and hence are\ninteresting for oceanographic problems. The classical sinusoidal shear flow given by \u03c9s(x, y) = sin(y)\nis a special case of Example 1.\nWe point out that the fact that we can apply Proposition 1 to the family (2.7) of flows is compatible\nwith the result in [16] which says that the essential spectrum of the linearized Euler operator in\nvorticity form lies on the imaginary axis when posed on L\u02da2. In addition to excluding unstable point\nspectrum, Proposition 1 provides an estimate for the algebraic growth of solutions which does not\n9\n1\nx\ny\n65\n3\n-1\n4\n2\n0\n0 2 3\n1\n-2\n-3\nFigure 2: The level sets (streamlines) of the stream function \u03c8s(x, y) = sinx+ sin y are plotted.\nfollow directly from the absence of spectrum in the open right half-plane. We should also mention\nthat it has been proved in [16, 20] that the essential spectrum is unstable on H\u02dam for each integer\nm 6= 0 in the vorticity formulation, while it is unstable on Hmdf for each integer m 6= 1 in the velocity\nformulation.\nLastly, we remark that the domain size is crucial for Hypothesis 2 to be true. For example, for\nthe sinusoidal shear flow \u03c9s(x, y) = sin(ky) with k > 1 on T2, Hypothesis 2 is not true anymore.\nIn line with this, it has been shown in [8, Proposition 5.1] that the associated operator A has an\neigenvalue with positive real part associated with a smooth eigenfunction, and eAt therefore grows\nexponentially on Hmdf (T2) for each m \u2265 0.\n2.2 Viscous perturbations: The Navier\u2013Stokes equations\nIn this section, we investigate the effects of viscous perturbations on mildly unstable flows. We\nconsider the solution u\u03b5(t, x, y) of (1.7) with initial condition u\u03b5(0, x, y) = us(x, y) where us is again\na smooth stationary solution of the Euler equation (1.6) with\n\u222b\nT2 us = 0.\nSetting u := u\u03b5 \u2212 us and \u03c9 := \u2207\u2227 u, we see that \u03c9 satisfies the equation\n\u2202t\u03c9 + us \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s = \u03b5[\u2206\u03c9 + F ]\u2212 u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9, u = J\u2207\u2206\u22121\u03c9, (2.8)\nwhere F = \u2207\u2227 f +\u2206\u03c9s, which can also be written as\n\u2202t\u03c9 = {\u03c9s,L\u03c9}+ \u03b5[\u2206\u03c9 + F ]\u2212 (u \u00b7 \u2207)\u03c9. (2.9)\nThe initial condition for \u03c9 is\n\u03c9(0, x, y) = 0. (2.10)\n10\nLastly, using multi-indices \u03b1 \u2208 N2 for derivatives with respect to (x, y), we define the weighted\nnorm\nEm(t) =\n\u2211\n0\u2264|\u03b1|\u2264m\n\u03b7|\u03b1|\u03b5|\u03b1|\u2016\u2202\u03b1\u03c9(t)\u20162\nfor an appropriate, sufficiently small constant \u03b7 > 0 that will be chosen later independently of \u03b5.\nProposition 2 If Hypothesis 2 is met, then the solution \u03c9(t) of (2.9)-(2.10) satisfies, for each\nfixed \u03b3 \u2208 (12 , 1), the estimate\nEm(t) \u2264 \u03b52\u03b3 \u2200t \u2208 [0, T\u03b5]\nfor \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1], where T\u03b5 \u2265 C\u03b5\n\u03b3\u22121\n3 .\nProof. Equation (2.9) has global solutions, hence we can define T\u03b5 to be the maximal time for\nwhich\nEm(t) + \u03b5\n\u222b t\n0\nDm(s) ds \u2264 \u03b52\u03b3 \u2200t \u2208 [0, T\u03b5) (2.11)\nwhere\nDm(t) =\n\u2211\n0\u2264|\u03b1|\u2264m\n\u03b7|\u03b1|\u03b5|\u03b1|\u2016\u2207P\u2202\u03b1\u03c9(t)\u20162.\nWe need to find a lower bound for T\u03b5. To get this bound, we shall prove that, assuming that (2.11)\nis true for some \u03b3 \u2208 (1\/2, 1), we actually have\nEm(t) + \u03b5\n\u222b t\n0\nDm(s) ds \u2264 C\u03b5\n3\u03b3+1\n2 T 3\/2\u03b5 \u2200t \u2208 [0, T\u03b5). (2.12)\nBefore we show that (2.11) implies (2.12), let us note that (2.11)-(2.12) together imply that\nT\u03b5 \u2265 C\u03b5\n\u03b3\u22121\n3\nwhich is the statement we wish to prove.\nWe begin with estimating E0(t) = \u2016\u03c9(t)\u20162. To estimate \u2016\u03c9\u2016, we write\n\u03c9(t, x, y) =\nn\u2211\nj=1\naj(t)\u03c9j(x, y) + \u03c9\u02dc(t, x, y),\nwhere \u03c9\u02dc = P\u03c9. Projecting (2.9) onto the null space and the range of P , we obtain\ndaj\ndt\n(t) = \u03b5\u3008\u2206\u03c9, \u03c9j\u3009+ \u03b5\u3008F, \u03c9j\u3009+ \u3008{\u03c9s,LP\u03c9}, \u03c9j\u3009 \u2212 \u3008u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9, \u03c9j\u3009 (2.13)\nand\n\u2202t\u03c9\u02dc + P{\u03c9s,L\u03c9\u02dc} = P [\u03b5(\u2206\u03c9 + F )\u2212 u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9] .\nFirst, we use (2.13) to estimate aj . Integrating by parts, we get\n|\u3008{\u03c9s,LP\u03c9}, \u03c9j\u3009| \u2264 C\u2016P\u03c9\u2016.\n11\nTherefore, using that \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0 and that\n\u2016u\u2016 \u2264 \u2016J\u2207\u2206\u22121\u03c9\u2016 \u2264 C\u2016\u03c9\u2016,\nwe obtain\n1\n2\nd\ndt\n|aj(t)|2 = \u03b5\u3008\u2206\u03c9, \u03c9j\u3009aj + \u03b5\u3008F, \u03c9j\u3009aj + \u3008{\u03c9s,LP\u03c9}, \u03c9j\u3009aj \u2212 \u3008u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9, \u03c9j\u3009aj\n= \u03b5\u3008\u03c9,\u2206\u03c9j\u3009aj + \u03b5\u3008F, \u03c9j\u3009aj + \u3008{\u03c9s,LP\u03c9}, \u03c9j\u3009aj + \u3008\u03c9, u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9j\u3009aj\n\u2264 C [\u2016P\u03c9\u2016 \u2016\u03c9\u2016+ \u03b5\u2016\u03c9\u2016+ \u2016\u03c9\u20163] . (2.14)\nAs in the previous section, we use the bilinear form N (\u03c9\u02dc) to estimate \u03c9\u02dc(t) = P\u03c9(t).

We now estimate the terms on the right-hand side of\n(2.15). First, note that\n\u03b5\u3008PF,L\u03c9\u02dc\u3009 \u2264 C\u03b5\u2016\u03c9\u2016.

(2.23)\nCombining (2.22) and (2.23), we obtain the desired estimate (2.12) for m = 0.\nThe estimates (2.12) for m \u2265 1 can now be obtained by classical energy methods. For instance, to\nestimate \u03b7\u03b5\u2016\u2202x\u03c9\u20162, we take the x-derivative of (2.9), multiply by \u2202x\u03c9 and integrate over T2 which\ngives an expression for 12\nd\ndt\u03b5\u03b7\u2016\u2202x\u03c9\u20162. The only dangerous term in this expression arises when we\nestimate \u3008\u2202x{\u03c9s,L\u03c9}, \u2202x\u03c9\u3009 by \u03b5\u03b7C\u2016\u2207\u03c9\u20162. The latter term, however, can be absorbed into the\nleft-hand side of (2.12) for m = 0 provided we choose \u03b7 > 0 sufficiently small. We omit the details\nas they are straightforward. We remark, however, that we need to eliminate the aforementioned\nbad term, since we would otherwise only obtain the estimate Em(t) \u2264 C\n\u222b t\n0 Em(s) ds + \u03b5\n2 + . . .\nwhich does not improve (1.8). We also note that we will not find better estimates by computing\n1\n2\nd\ndtN (\u2202x\u03c9\u02dc) since we break the Hamiltonian structure by taking the x-derivative of (2.9) so that\nthe useful identity (2.16) is no longer true.\n13\nTheorem 2 If Hypothesis 2 is met, then there exist numbers C > 0, \u03bd \u2208 (1\/2, 1) and \u03ba > 0 such\nthat\n\u2016u(t)\u2016L\u221e + \u2016\u2207u(t)\u2016L\u221e \u2264 C\u03b5\u03bd \u2200t \u2208 [0, \u03b5\u2212\u03ba) (2.24)\nwhere \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u03b50].\nThe above theorem shows that the perturbed flow u\u03b5(t, x, y) satisfies Hypothesis 1 whenever the\nstationary flow us(x, y) satisfies Hypothesis 2. In particular, the Melnikov calculations in Theorem 1\nare applicable to these base flows.\nProof. For any fixed \u03b3 with 3\/4 < \u03b3 < 1, we can find \u03ba and \u03b8 with 0 < \u03ba < (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\/3 and\n1\/2 < \u03b8 \u2264 1 such that \u03bd := \u03b3 \u2212 \u03ba\u2212 \u03b8\/2 satisfies 1\/2 < \u03bd < 1. Proposition 2 then implies that\n\u2016u(t)\u2016L\u221e\n(2.20)\n\u2264 C\u2016\u2207\u03c9\u2016\u03b8 \u2016\u03c9\u20161\u2212\u03b8 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b3(1\u2212\u03b8)+(\u03b3\u22121\/2)\u03b8 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b3\u2212\u03b8\/2 = C\u03b5\u03bd (2.25)\nuniformly in t \u2208 [0, \u03b5\u2212\u03ba). This gives the first part of (2.24).\nTo estimate \u2016\u2207u\u2016L\u221e , we shall use the classical estimate [4]\n\u2016\u2207u(t)\u2016L\u221e \u2264 C(1 + ln \u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016H2)\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016L\u221e . (2.26)\nThus, we need to bound \u2016\u03c9\u2016L\u221e . We remark that the estimate\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016L\u221e\n(2.20)\n\u2264 C\u2016\u2206\u03c9\u2016\u03b8 \u2016\u03c9\u20161\u2212\u03b8 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b3(1\u2212\u03b8)+(\u03b3\u22121)\u03b8 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b3\u2212\u03b8,\nwhich holds for 1\/2 < \u03b8 \u2264 1, is not sufficient since we cannot achieve \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b8 > 1\/2 since \u03b3 < 1.\nInstead, we estimate \u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016L\u221e indirectly from (2.8)\n\u2202t\u03c9 + (us + u) \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b5\u2206\u03c9 = \u03b5F \u2212 u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s (2.27)\nby using it to derive bounds for \u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016Lp for each p \u2265 2. From (2.27), we obtain\nd\ndt\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016pLp = p\n\u222b\nT2\n[\u2212\u03c9p\u22121(u+ us) \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 + \u03b5\u03c9p\u22121\u2206\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9p\u22121u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s + \u03b5F\u03c9p\u22121] dxdy. (2.28)\nWe consider each of the terms on the right-hand side separately. First, since \u2207 \u00b7 (u + us) = 0, we\nsee that\np\n\u222b\nT2\n(u+ us) \u00b7 (\u2207\u03c9)\u03c9p\u22121 =\n\u222b\nT2\n(u+ us) \u00b7 \u2207(\u03c9p) = \u2212\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9p\u2207 \u00b7 (u+ us) = 0.\nIntegration by parts also shows that\np\u03b5\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9p\u22121\u2206\u03c9 = \u2212p(p\u2212 1)\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9p\u22122|\u2207\u03c9|2 \u2264 0\nsince p \u2265 2. For the remaining two terms, we use the Ho\u00a8lder inequality and obtain\np\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9p\u22121u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s + p\u03b5\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9p\u22121F \u2264 p\u2016\u03c9p\u22121\u2016Lq(\u2016u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s\u2016Lp + \u03b5\u2016F\u2016Lp)\n\u2264 pC(4pi2)1\/p\u2016\u03c9\u2016p\u22121Lp (\u03b5+ \u2016u\u2016L\u221e) (2.29)\n14\nwhere C is independent of p, and q is chosen according to 1\/q = 1 \u2212 1\/p. Substituting these\nestimates into (2.28), we get\np\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016p\u22121Lp\nd\ndt\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016Lp = ddt\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016\np\nLp \u2264 pC(4pi2)1\/p\u2016\u03c9\u2016p\u22121Lp (\u03b5+ \u2016u\u2016L\u221e)\nand therefore\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016Lp \u2264 C(4pi2)1\/p\n\u222b t\n0\n(\u03b5+ \u2016u(s)\u2016L\u221e) ds\nfor every t \u2208 [0, \u03b5\u2212\u03ba). Taking the limit p\u2192\u221e and using (2.25), we see that\n\u2016\u03c9(t)\u2016L\u221e \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b3\u2212\u03ba\u2212\u03b8\/2.\nwhich, once substituted into (2.26), gives\n\u2016\u2207u(t)\u2016L\u221e \u2264 C| ln \u03b5|\u03b5\u03b3\u2212\u03ba\u2212\u03b8\/2 \u2200t \u2208 [0, \u03b5\u2212\u03ba).\nThe choices we made above guarantee that 1\/2 < \u03b3 \u2212 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b8\/2 < 1. Thus, choosing \u03bd so that\n1\/2 < \u03bd < \u03b3 \u2212 \u03ba\u2212 \u03b8\/2 establishes the desired estimate (2.24).\n3 The two-dimensional viscous barotropic equations\nWe consider the \u03b2-barotropic Euler equation\n\u2202t\u2206\u03c80 + {\u03c80,\u2206\u03c80}+ \u03b2\u2202x\u03c80 = 0 (3.1)\nand the associated barotropic Navier\u2013Stokes equation\n\u2202t\u2206\u03c8\u03b5 + {\u03c8\u03b5,\u2206\u03c8\u03b5}+ \u03b2\u2202x\u03c8\u03b5 = \u03b5(\u22062\u03c8\u03b5 + f) (3.2)\non T2 and present two classes of solutions that satisfy the long-term estimates required in Hypoth-\nesis 1.\n3.1 Example 1 continued\nThe stream functions\n\u03c8s(t, x, y) = A sin(x\u2212 ct+ a) +B sin(y + b), c = \u2212\u03b2\nprovide an interesting class of solutions to (3.1) that exhibit closed stream lines.

For appropriate values of A and B,\nthe ODE (1.3) exhibits separatrices as illustrated in Figure 3 where the level sets of qs(\u03be, y) are\nplotted.\nThus, it is desirable to take \u03c8s as an initial condition for (3.2).

Setting \u03c9 = \u2206(\u03c8\u03b5\u2212\u03c8s) and \u03c9s = \u2206\u03c8s,\nwe see that \u03c9 satisfies the equation\n\u2202t\u03c9 = {\u03c9s,L\u03c9} \u2212 \u03b2\u2202\u03be(L\u03c9)\u2212 J\u2207\u2206\u22121\u03c9 \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 + \u03b5(\u2206\u03c9 + F ) (3.4)\nwith initial condition\n\u03c9(0, \u03be, y) = 0 (3.5)\nwhere F = \u2207 \u2227 f + \u2206\u03c9s and L = 1 + \u2206\u22121. The following proposition shows that the long-time\nbehavior of (3.4) is similar to that of the Euler equation.\nProposition 3 The velocity field associated with the solution of (3.4)-(3.5) satisfies (2.24).\nProof.

Using the bilinear form\nN (\u03c9) =\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03c9L\u03c9,\nwe claim that the conclusion of Proposition 2 is also true for (3.4).

Never-\ntheless, Hypothesis 1 is met provided the forcing term f satisfies certain conditions.\n17\nProposition 4 If the function f(t, (x+ y)\/2, (x\u2212 y)\/2) is 2pi-periodic in (x, y), then the velocity\nfield associated with the Rossby-wave solution of (3.4)-(3.5) satisfies (2.24).\nThe assumption on the forcing term is true, for instance, if f(t, x, y) is pi-periodic in (x, y).\nProof. We introduce the new coordinates (x\u02c7, y\u02c7) via\n(x\u02c7, y\u02c7) = (x+ y, x\u2212 y), (x, y) =\n(\nx\u02c7+ y\u02c7\n2\n,\nx\u02c7\u2212 y\u02c7\n2\n)\n.\nThe transformed stream function\n\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5(t, x\u02c7, y\u02c7) := \u03c8\u03b5(t, x, y)\nthen satisfies the PDE\n\u2202t\u2206\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5 = 2{\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5,\u2206\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5}+ 2\u03b5\u22062\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b22 (\u2202x\u02c7\u03c8\u02c7\n\u03b5 + \u2202y\u02c7\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5) +\n\u03b5\n2\nf\u02c7 (3.6)\non T2, where f\u02c7(t, x\u02c7, y\u02c7) = f(t, (x\u02c7+ y\u02c7)\/2, (x\u02c7\u2212 y\u02c7)\/2), and where the differential operators act on the\nnew variables (x\u02c7, y\u02c7). Since the transformed base flow\n\u03c8\u02c7s(t, x\u02c7, y\u02c7) = \u03c8s\n(\nt,\nx\u02c7+ y\u02c7\n2\n\u2212 ct, x\u02c7\u2212 y\u02c7\n2\n)\n= A sin\n(\nx\u02c7+ y\u02c7\n2\n\u2212 ct\n)\nsin\n(\nx\u02c7\u2212 y\u02c7\n2\n)\nand the transformed forcing F\u02c7 are both 2pi-periodic in (x\u02c7, y\u02c7), so is the solution \u03c8\u02c7\u03b5 of (3.6).\nNext, we introduce the moving frame coordinates \u03be = x\u02c7 \u2212 ct and \u03b7 = y\u02c7 \u2212 ct where c = \u2212\u03b2\/2.\nWriting the vorticity \u03c9\u02c7 = \u2206(\u03c8\u02c7\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c8\u02c7s) as a function of the independent variables (t, \u03be, \u03b7), we find\nthat it satisfies the equation\n\u2202t\u03c9\u02c7 +\n\u03b2\n2\n(\u2202\u03beL\u02c7\u03c9\u02c7 + \u2202\u03b7L\u02c7\u03c9\u02c7) = 2{\u03c9\u02c7s, L\u02c7\u03c9\u02c7}+ 2\u03b5\u2206\u03c9\u02c7 + \u03b5F \u2212 2J\u2207\u2206\u22121\u03c9\u02c7 \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9\u02c7\nwhere the transformed operator L\u02c7 is now given by\nL\u02c7 = 1+\u2206\u22121.\nThus, L\u02c7 satisfies Hypothesis 2, and Proposition 3 remains true since the additional term \u2202\u03b7L\u02c7\u03c9\u02c7 can\nbe treated in the same fashion as the term \u2202\u03beL\u02c7\u03c9\u02c7 that appeared in the proof of Proposition 3.\n4 Extensions to modified Navier\u2013Stokes equations\nIn Section 2, we incorporated viscosity by adding \u2206u, corresponding to molecular viscosity, to\nthe Euler equation, yielding the classical Navier\u2013Stokes equation. A major source of viscosity in\nproblems from meteorology and oceanography is the effect of small-scale eddies on larger structures\nin the fluid flow. Smagorinsky [17] proposed a nonlinear viscosity force which yields the modified\nNavier\u2013Stokes equation\n\u2202tu+ (u \u00b7 \u2207)u+\u2207p = \u03b5[div(|S|S) + f ], \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0 (4.1)\n18\nwhere S = S(u) is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient given by\nS = S(u) :=\n1\n2\n(\u2207u+ (\u2207u)\u2217).\nGiven the widespread use of (4.1) and other related models (see below), it is of interest to see\nwhether the long-time estimate (5.1) can also be established for (4.1) as this would allow us to\nmake prediction on the transport based on the Melnikov theory in Theorem 1.\nUnfortunately, the Smagorinsky model seems difficult to attack. The main problem is to obtain\nsufficient regularity for solutions of (4.1). Indeed, for the Navier\u2013Stokes equation, we have used\nthe classical local existence theorem of smooth solutions to reduce the verification of Hypothesis 1\nto establishing stability. Because of the singularity in the viscosity tensor at points where S(u)\nvanishes, the Smagorinsky model does not fit into this framework: as far as we are aware, there is\nno local existence result for smooth solutions of (4.1).\nSurprisingly, (4.1) has much better mathematical properties with regard to weak solutions than\nthe classical Navier\u2013Stokes equation: existence and uniqueness results for weak solutions have been\nproved in [10], even in 3d; we refer to [7] for further references.\nTo take into account some of the effects of the Smagorinsky model, we consider the nonlinear\nviscosity model\n\u2202tu+ (u \u00b7 \u2207)u+\u2207p = \u03b5[div(T (S)) + f ], \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0 (4.2)\nwith a stress tensor T (S) of the form\nT (S) = b(S)S\nwhere b : R2\u00d72 \u2192 R is smooth and bounded away from zero so that\nb \u2208 C\u221e(R2\u00d72,R), b(p) \u2265 b0 > 0 \u2200 p \u2208 R2\u00d72. (4.3)\nThe example b(S) = (1 + |S|2) 12 is of particular interest as it incorporates both molecular and\nSmagorinsky viscosity. Note that the term b(S) = 1+ |S| obtained by simply adding molecular and\nSmagorinsky viscosity is bounded away from zero but not smooth at S = 0.\nFor stress tensors T (S) = b(S)S that obey (4.3), Theorem 2 can be readily extended:\nTheorem 3 Assume that b satisfies (4.3). If Hypothesis 2 is met, then there exist numbers C > 0,\n\u03bd \u2208 (1\/2, 1) and \u03ba > 0 such that the solution u\u03b5 of (4.2) with initial value us enjoys the estimate\n(2.24).\nProof. The strategy is the same as for the proof of Theorem 2. As before, we need to establish\nthe estimates stated in Proposition 2. Setting u = u\u03b5 \u2212 us and \u03c9 = curlu, we see that \u03c9 satisfies\nthe equation\n\u2202t\u03c9 + us \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9s + u \u00b7 \u2207\u03c9 = \u03b5 [b(S(u+ us))\u2206\u03c9 + F ] +Q, (4.4)\nwhere\nQ = \u03b5 curl\u2207 \u00b7 [b(S(u+ us))S(us)] + \u03b5 curl [S(u)\u2207(b(S(u+ us)))].\n19\nEquation (4.4) is a quasilinear parabolic equation for which we have local existence of solutions\nin H\u02das for s > 4 (see, for instance, [18, Chapter 15]). Thus, we can define T\u03b5 as in the proof of\nProposition 2 and establish the estimate (2.12) by the same methods. We claim that the new\nnonlinear terms can be treated as before by using Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg\u2013Moser estimates (see again\n[18]): The key point is that these terms make only harmless contributions to the estimates because\nall new higher-order derivatives which appear have a factor \u03b5 in front of them. To illustrate this\nclaim, we explain in detail how the term\u2211\n|\u03b1|=m\nI\u03b1 :=\n\u2211\n|\u03b1|=m\n\u03b5\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03b5|\u03b1|\u2202\u03b1 (b(S(u+ us))\u2206\u03c9) \u2202\u03b1\u03c9 dxdy (4.5)\nis treated. First, thanks to the a priori assumption (2.11) and the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg inequalities\n(2.20), we have\n\u2016\u2207u\u2016L\u221e \u2264 \u03b5\u03b3\u2212 34 , \u2016\u22072u\u2016L\u221e \u2264 \u03b5\u03b3\u2212 54 , \u2016\u2206\u03c9\u2016L\u221e \u2264 \u03b5\u03b3\u2212 74 (4.6)\nfor t < T\u03b5. To estimate I\u03b1, we write\nI\u03b1 = \u03b5\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03b5|\u03b1|b\u2206(\u2202\u03b1\u03c9) \u2202\u03b1\u03c9 + \u03b5\n\u222b\nT2\n\u03b5|\u03b1|[\u2202\u03b1, b](\u2206\u03c9) \u2202\u03b1\u03c9 =: II\u03b1 + III\u03b1.\nUpon integrating by parts and using assumption (4.3), the estimate (4.6) and Young\u2019s inequality,\nwe get\nII\u03b1 \u2264 \u2212\u03b5\u03b5|\u03b1| b0 \u2016\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u20162 + C\u03b5 \u03b5|\u03b1|\n\u222b\nT2\n|\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9| |\u2202\u03b1\u03c9|(1 + |\u22072u|)\n\u2264 \u2212\u03b5\u03b5|\u03b1| b0 \u2016\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u20162 + C\u03b5\u03b3\u2212 14 \u03b5|\u03b1| \u2016\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u2016 \u2016\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u2016\n\u2264 \u2212\u03b5\u03b5|\u03b1| b0\n2\n\u2016\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u20162 + C\u03b52\u03b3\u2212 32 \u03b5|\u03b1|\u2016\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u20162. (4.7)\nTo estimate III\u03b1, we write\nIII\u03b1 \u2264 C\u03b5\u03b5|\u03b1| \u2016\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u2016 \u2016[\u2202\u03b1, b]\u2206\u03c9\u2016, (4.8)\nand use commutator and Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg\u2013Moser estimates (see [18, Chapter 13]) to get\n\u2016[\u2202\u03b1, b]\u2206\u03c9\u2016 \u2264 C (\u2016b\u2016H|\u03b1| \u2016\u2206\u03c9\u2016L\u221e + \u2016\u2207b\u2016L\u221e \u2016\u2206\u03c9\u2016H|\u03b1|\u22121)\n\u2264 C ((1 + \u2016\u2207u\u2016H|\u03b1|)\u2016\u2206\u03c9\u2016L\u221e + (1 + \u2016\u22072u\u2016L\u221e)\u2016\u2207\u03c9\u2016H|\u03b1|) . (4.9)\nFinally, we can combine (4.7), (4.8) and (4.9) to get, upon using (4.6) and Young\u2019s inequality,\u2211\n|\u03b1|=m\nI\u03b1 \u2264 \u2212\u03b5b04\n\u2211\n|\u03b1|=m\n\u03b5|\u03b1|\u2016\u2207\u2202\u03b1\u03c9\u20162 + C(\u03b52\u03b3\u2212 32 + \u03b5\u03b3\u2212 34 )Em.\nLastly, we note that the second term in the above estimate is small for \u03b3 > 3\/4, which finishes the\nanalysis for the term (4.5). We omit the analysis of the other terms which is quite analogous to\nthe one given above.\n20\n5 Discussion\nOur motivation for this paper has been to determine the nature of transport that occurs when a\nsmall amount of viscosity and forcing is added to an inviscid stationary fluid flow. Thus, starting\nwith a smooth stationary fluid flow us(x, y) of the Euler equation (1.6) on T2, we considered the\nsolution u\u03b5(t, x, y) of the Navier\u2013Stokes equation (1.7) with initial condition u\u03b5(0, x, y) = us(x, y),\nwhere \u03b5 > 0 is the coefficient of viscosity. We showed in earlier work [3, 15] that Melnikov theory\ncan be used to make predictions about transport for 0 < \u03b5 \u00bf 1 over time scales of the order \u03b5\u2212\u03ba\nfor \u03ba > 0 provided there are numbers C > 0 and \u03bd \u2208 (12 , 1] such that\n\u2016u\u03b5(t)\u2212 us\u2016W 1,\u221e(T2) \u2264 C\u03b5\u03bd (5.1)\nfor 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03b5\u2212\u03ba. In this paper, we established (5.1) in Theorem 2 whenever the underlying stationary\nflow us(x, y) satisfies Hypothesis 2 on the spectrum of a certain operator L whose coefficients\ndepend on the profile us(x, y). We gave several example flows, including those induced by the\nstream functions\n\u03c8s(x, y) = A sin(x+ a) +B sin(y + b),\nfor which Hypothesis 2, and therefore the estimate (5.1), is true.\nWe also considered solutions of the \u03b2-barotropic Navier\u2013Stokes equations (3.2) starting with a\nsolution to the \u03b2-barotropic Euler equation (3.1). We proved that the estimate (5.1) holds for the\nRossby waves with stream function\n\u03c8s(t, x, y) = A sin\n(\nx+\n\u03b2t\n2\n)\nsin(y)\nand for the fluid flows associated with the stream function\n\u03c8s(t, x, y) = A sin(x+ \u03b2t) +B sin(y).\nIn Section 4, we established the estimate (5.1) for the modified Navier\u2013Stokes equation\n\u2202tu+ (u \u00b7 \u2207)u+\u2207p = \u03b5[div(T (S)) + f ], \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0 (5.2)\nwhen the stress tensor T (S) is of the form T (S) = b(S)S with\nb \u2208 C\u221e(R2\u00d72,R), b \u2265 b0 > 0, (5.3)\nwhere S = S(u) denotes the symmetric part of\u2207u. The restriction to smooth and positive functions\nb excludes the Smagorinsky model [17] for which b(S) = |S|. The main obstacle for extending our\nresults to functions such as b(S) = |S| is the lack of regularity theory for solutions of (5.2) when\n(5.3) is not met.\nLastly, we mention that we focused entirely on periodic boundary conditions. It would be interesting\nto see to which extent our results, and specifically the estimate (5.1), can be generalized to other\nboundary conditions.\n21\nAcknowledgments C.K.R.T.
