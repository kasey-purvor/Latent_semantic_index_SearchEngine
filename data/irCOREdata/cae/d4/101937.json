Introduction. Vector borne diseases are infectious diseases that are carried\nby insects from one host to another. Examples include malaria, West Nile virus,\nyellow fever, dengue fever, lyme disease, and plague. In many of these diseases it is\nthe mosquito that carries the virus, but ticks and \ufb02eas can also be responsible. The\ndiseases can be spread to humans, birds, and other animals.\nMuch has been done in terms of modeling and analysis of the transmission dy-\nnamics and spatial spread of vector borne diseases; see Anderson and May [1], Mur-\nray [20], Brauer and Castillo-Chavez [4], Edelstein-Keshet [6], Hethcote [10], Kot [13],\nJones and Sleeman [12], Wonham and coworkers [26, 27], etc. However, one impor-\ntant biological aspect of the hosts\u2014the stage structure\u2014seems to have received little\nattention, although structured population models have been intensively studied (see\nDiekmann and Heesterbeek [5]) in the context of population dynamics and spatial\necology, and the interaction of stage-structure with spatial dispersal has been re-\nceiving considerable attention in association with the theoretical development of the\nso-called reaction-di\ufb00usion equations with nonlocal delayed feedback (see the papers\nby Gourley, So, and Wu [7] and Gourley and Wu [8] and the references therein).\nThe developmental stages of hosts have a profound impact on the transmission\ndynamics of vector borne diseases. In the case of West Nile virus the transmission cycle\ninvolves both mosquitoes and birds, the crow species being particularly important.\nNestling crows are crows that have hatched but are helpless and stay in the nest,\nreceiving more-or-less continuous care from the mother for up to two weeks and less\n\u2217Received by the editors December 30, 2005; accepted for publication (in revised form) Septem-\nber 20, 2006; published electronically January 12, 2007.

Fledgling crows are old enough to have left the nest (they\nleave it after about \ufb01ve weeks), but they cannot \ufb02y very well. After three or four\nmonths these \ufb02edglings will be old enough to obtain all of their food by themselves.\nAs these facts demonstrate, the maturation stages of adult birds, \ufb02edglings, and\nnestlings are all very di\ufb00erent from a biological and an epidemiological perspective,\nand a realistic model needs to take these di\ufb00erent stages into account. For example, in\ncomparison with grown birds, the nestlings and \ufb02edglings have much higher disease-\ninduced death rate, much poorer ability to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, and\nmuch less spatial mobility [18, 2, 22]. In this paper we shall, in fact, assume that\nthere is only one preadult stage for the host population, which in the West Nile virus\ncontext could be thought of as the \ufb02edgling stage of crows.\nThe aim of this paper is to formulate a model for the evolution of some vec-\ntor borne diseases whose transmission dynamics and patterns are similar to those of\nWest Nile virus. Other recent mathematical models for this disease include the works\nof Bowman et al. [3], Lewis, Renclawowicz, and van den Driessche [16], and Won-\nham et al. [26, 27], some of which use a di\ufb00erent incidence function normalized by\nbird density. We start with the classical McKendrick von-Foerster equations for an\nage-structured reservoir population divided into two epidemiological compartments\nof susceptible and infected (and infectious), coupled with a scalar delay di\ufb00erential\nequation for the adult vector population under the assumption that the total vector\npopulation is maintained at a constant level. We then use the standard technique of\nintegration along characteristics to reduce the model to a system of \ufb01ve coupled de-\nlay di\ufb00erential equations for the susceptible and infected juvenile and adult reservoir\npopulations and the adult infected vector. If spatial di\ufb00usion is allowed, a similar\nderivation leads to a reaction-di\ufb00usion system with nonlocal and highly nonlinear\ndelayed interactions. The model derivation is carried out in detail in sections 2 (for\nODE models) and 3 (for PDE models), together with some detailed biological and\nepidemiological explanations of all terms involved.\nWe consider the qualitative behaviors of the reduced ordinary delay di\ufb00erential\nsystem in subsections 2.1\u20132.4. We establish the positiveness and boundedness of the\nreduced system, and we emphasize the need to restrict the initial data to the subset\nwhich is biologically and epidemiologically realistic. We then establish a concrete\ncriterion, expressed in terms of the model parameters, for disease eradication. This\nis achieved using some comparison techniques and di\ufb00erential inequalities. We also\nobtain a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for the disease-free equilibrium to be locally\nasymptotically stable\u2014this is done using an application of the spectral properties of\na linear delay di\ufb00erential system due to Smith [23]. The sharpness of the disease\neradication condition is then tested using the available data and parameters for West\nNile virus, and our simulations show that sustained oscillation can occur, should this\ndisease eradication condition be violated.\nIn section 3, consider the issue of spatial spread of the disease in a one-dimensional\nsetting. We provide a detailed formal calculation of the so-called minimal wave speed\nthat is expected to coincide with the propagation speed of the disease, and we compare\nthe predicted wave speed with data in the literature relating to the observed speed of\nspread of West Nile virus across North America. Finally, in section 4, we discuss our\n\ufb01ndings together with some of the corresponding results for a modi\ufb01ed model with a\ndi\ufb00erent incidence function.\n2. Model derivation. We shall think of the disease as mosquito borne, since\nmosquitoes are responsible for transmitting many of the vector borne diseases that\n410 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\ncurrently constitute signi\ufb01cant public health issues in various parts of the world.\nWe will also refer to the reservoir as the host, and assume that the host popu-\nlation is age-structured. We start with a simple division of the host population into\nsusceptible hosts s(t, a) and infected hosts i(t, a) at time t and age a. These host pop-\nulations are assumed to evolve according to the McKendrick von-Foerster equations\nfor an age-structured population:\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202s\n\u2202a\n= \u2212ds(a)s(t, a)\u2212 \u03b2(a)s(t, a)mi(t)(2.1)\nand\n\u2202i\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202i\n\u2202a\n= \u2212di(a)i(t, a) + \u03b2(a)s(t, a)mi(t),(2.2)\nwhere mi(t) is the number of infected adult mosquitoes satisfying another equation\nbelow, and \u03b2(a) is the age-dependent transmission coe\ufb03cient, and it is assumed that\nconversion of hosts from susceptible to infected occurs through interaction of suscep-\ntible hosts with infected mosquitoes, and at this stage we assume that the rate of\nconversion is given by mass action. We shall discuss the limitations of the model\ninvolving mass action and shall indicate how our work can be extended to include a\nmore standard incidence term that includes dividing by the density of the host popu-\nlation. The functions ds(a) and di(a) are the age-dependent death rates of susceptible\nand infected hosts.\nWe shall further split the host population into juveniles and adults, de\ufb01ned re-\nspectively as those of age less than some number \u03c4 and those of age greater than\n\u03c4 . We will work with the following choices for the death rates and the transmission\ncoe\ufb03cient \u03b2(a):\nds(a) =\n{\ndsj , a < \u03c4,\ndsa, a > \u03c4,\ndi(a) =\n{\ndij , a < \u03c4,\ndia, a > \u03c4,\n(2.3)\nand\n\u03b2(a) =\n{\n\u03b2j , a < \u03c4,\n\u03b2a, a > \u03c4.\n(2.4)\nThe subscripts in these quantities refer to disease and juvenile\/adult status; thus, for\nexample, the per capita death rates for susceptible juveniles and infected adults would\nbe dsj and dia, respectively. The above choices enable us to formulate a closed system\nof delay di\ufb00erential equations involving only the total numbers of hosts classi\ufb01ed as\nadult susceptibles, adult infected, juvenile susceptibles, and juvenile infected. These\ntotal numbers are given respectively, using self-explanatory notations, by\nAs(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\ns(t, a) da, Ai(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\ni(t, a) da, Js(t) =\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\ns(t, a) da,\nJi(t) =\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\ni(t, a) da.\n(2.5)\nWe assume no vertical transmission in the system (both from host and vector).\nOn the further assumption that the birth rate is a function of the total number of\nsusceptible adult hosts, we have the following expressions for the birth rates s(t, 0)\nand i(t, 0):\ns(t, 0) = b(As(t)), i(t, 0) = 0,(2.6)\nSPREAD OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 411\nwhere b(\u00b7) is the birth rate function for hosts (we shall later introduce B(\u00b7) as the\nbirth rate function for mosquitoes). Equations (2.1) and (2.2) are solved subject to\n(2.6).\nLet us now \ufb01nd a di\ufb00erential equation for As(t). Di\ufb00erentiating the expression\nfor As(t) in (2.5), making use of (2.1), (2.3), and (2.4), and assuming (reasonably)\nthat s(t,\u221e) = 0, we quickly \ufb01nd that\ndAs\ndt\n= s(t, \u03c4)\u2212 dsaAs(t)\u2212 \u03b2ami(t)As(t).(2.7)\nNext we need to \ufb01nd s(t, \u03c4). This will be achieved by solving (2.1) for 0 < a < \u03c4 . Set\ns\u03be(a) = s(\u03be + a, a).\nThen\nds\u03be\nda\n=\n[\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202s\n\u2202a\n]\nt=\u03be+a\n= \u2212s\u03be(a)[ds(a) + \u03b2(a)mi(\u03be + a)],\nso that\ns(\u03be + a, a) = s\u03be(a) = s\u03be(0) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b a\n0\n(ds(\u03b7) + \u03b2(\u03b7)mi(\u03be + \u03b7)) d\u03b7\n)\n= b(As(\u03be)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b a\n0\n(ds(\u03b7) + \u03b2(\u03b7)mi(\u03be + \u03b7)) d\u03b7\n)\n.(2.8)\nSetting a = \u03c4 and \u03be = t\u2212 \u03c4 and using (2.3), (2.4) gives\ns(t, \u03c4) = b(As(t\u2212 \u03c4)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(t\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03b7)) d\u03b7\n)\n.\nSubstituting this into (2.7) gives, after a change of variables in the integral,\ndAs\ndt\n= b(As(t\u2212 \u03c4)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(u)) du\n)\n\u2212 dsaAs(t)\u2212 \u03b2ami(t)As(t).\n(2.9)\nIn much the same way, we obtain the following equation for Js(t):\ndJs\ndt\n= b(As(t))\u2212 b(As(t\u2212 \u03c4)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(u)) du\n)\n\u2212 dsjJs(t)\u2212 \u03b2jmi(t)Js(t).\n(2.10)\nThe di\ufb00erential equation for Ai(t) turns out to be more complicated. Di\ufb00erenti-\nating the expression for Ai(t) in (2.5), assuming i(t,\u221e) = 0, and using (2.3) and (2.4)\ngives\ndAi(t)\ndt\n= i(t, \u03c4)\u2212 diaAi(t) + \u03b2ami(t)As(t),(2.11)\nand we need to \ufb01nd i(t, \u03c4), by solving (2.2) for 0 < a < \u03c4 . Setting i\u03be(a) = i(\u03be + a, a)\nand di\ufb00erentiating with respect to a, we \ufb01nd from (2.2) that\ndi\u03be(a)\nda\n+ diji\u03be(a) = \u03b2jmi(\u03be + a)s(\u03be + a, a).\n412 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\nIntegrating this from 0 to a and recalling that i\u03be(0) = i(\u03be, 0) = 0 by (2.6), we \ufb01nd\nthat\ni(\u03be + a, a) = i\u03be(a) = \u03b2j\n\u222b a\n0\ne\u2212dij(a\u2212\u03b7)mi(\u03be + \u03b7)s(\u03be + \u03b7, \u03b7) d\u03b7.\nTherefore,\ni(t, \u03c4) = \u03b2j\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\ne\u2212dij(\u03c4\u2212\u03b7)mi(t\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03b7)s(t\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03b7, \u03b7) d\u03b7\n= \u03b2j\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\ne\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03be)mi(\u03be)s(\u03be, \u03be + \u03c4 \u2212 t) d\u03be.(2.12)\nIn this integral the second argument of s(\u03be, \u03be + \u03c4 \u2212 t) goes from 0 to \u03c4 , and therefore\nan expression for s(\u03be, \u03be+ \u03c4 \u2212 t) can be obtained from the earlier analysis. From (2.8),\ns(\u03be, \u03be + \u03c4 \u2212 t) = b(As(t\u2212 \u03c4)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\n[dsj + \u03b2jmi(v)] dv\n)\n.\nInsertion of this expression into (2.12) yields an expression for i(t, \u03c4) that involves\nonly the state variables in (2.5) and mi(t), and insertion of this expression for i(t, \u03c4)\ninto (2.11) \ufb01nally gives the di\ufb00erential equation for Ai(t) to be\ndAi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212diaAi(t) + \u03b2ami(t)As(t)\n+ \u03b2jb(As(t\u2212 \u03c4))\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nmi(\u03be)e\n\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03be) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(v)) dv\n)\nd\u03be.(2.13)\nSimilarly, the di\ufb00erential equation for Ji(t) can be shown to be\ndJi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212dijJi(t) + \u03b2jmi(t)Js(t)\n\u2212 \u03b2jb(As(t\u2212 \u03c4))\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nmi(\u03be)e\n\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03be) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(v)) dv\n)\nd\u03be.(2.14)\nTo close the system we still need a di\ufb00erential equation for the variable mi(t),\nbut \ufb01rst we would like to discuss the ecological interpretation of the complicated\nintegral term appearing in (2.13) and (2.14). The \ufb01rst two terms in the right-hand\nside of (2.13) are easy to interpret. They are, respectively, the death rate of infected\nadults and conversion of susceptible adults to infected adults via contact with infected\nmosquitoes. The last term in (2.13) tells us the rate at which infected immatures\nbecome infected adults having contracted the disease in childhood. This term is\nthe rate at which infected individuals pass through age \u03c4 . Now, an individual that\nis of age \u03c4 at time t will have been born at time t \u2212 \u03c4 . Recall, however, that all\nindividuals are born as susceptibles. This is why the birth rate b(As(t\u2212\u03c4)) is involved.\nThe individuals we are presently discussing have each acquired the infection at some\nstage during childhood, so assume that a particular individual acquires it at a time\n\u03be \u2208 (t \u2212 \u03c4, t). This particular individual remained susceptible from its birth at time\nt\u2212 \u03c4 until time \u03be, and the probability of this happening is\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\nt\u2212\u03c4\n(dsj + \u03b2jmi(v)) dv\n)\n.\nSPREAD OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 413\nThe probability that the individual will survive from becoming infected at time \u03be until\nbecoming an adult at time t is\ne\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03be).\nThese two exponentials both feature in the last term in (2.13). The product \u03b2jmi(\u03be)\nis the per capita conversion rate of susceptible juveniles to infected juveniles at time\n\u03be, and \u03be running from t\u2212 \u03c4 to t totals up the contributions from all possible times at\nwhich infected individuals passing into adulthood might have acquired the infection.\nFinally, we need di\ufb00erential equations for the mosquitoes. Let mT (t) be the total\nnumber of (adult) mosquitoes, divided into infected mosquitoes mi(t) and suscepti-\nble mosquitoes mT (t) \u2212 mi(t). Death and reproductive activity for mosquitoes are\nassumed not to depend on whether they are carrying the disease or not, and so the\ntotal number of adult mosquitoes is assumed to obey\ndmT (t)\ndt\n= e\u2212dl\u03c3B(mT (t\u2212 \u03c3))\u2212 dmmT (t),(2.15)\nwhere dl and dm denote the death rates of larval and adult mosquitoes, respectively,\nand \u03c3 is the length of the larval phase from egg to adult. The function B(\u00b7) is the birth\nrate function for mosquitoes. It is possible but unnecessary to write down a di\ufb00erential\nequation for larval mosquitoes. Infected adult mosquitoes mi(t) are assumed to obey\ndmi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212dmmi(t) + \u03b2m(mT (t)\u2212mi(t))(Ji(t) + \u03b1Ai(t)).(2.16)\nThus, the rate at which mosquitoes become infected is given by mass action as the\nproduct of susceptible mosquitoes mT (t) \u2212 mi(t) and infected birds which may be\neither juvenile or adult. The presence of the factor \u03b1 is to account for the possibility\nthat juvenile and adult birds might not be equally vulnerable to being bitten. Again,\nwe defer the discussion of a more standard incidence term to the \ufb01nal section.\nCertain assumptions will be made concerning the birth function B(\u00b7) for the\nmosquitoes. These assumptions, which are ecologically reasonable, are geared towards\nensuring that the total number mT (t) of mosquitoes stabilizes and does not tend to\nzero (otherwise the disease is automatically eradicated and the model is not interest-\ning). These assumptions are\nB(0) = 0, B(\u00b7) is strictly monotonically increasing, there exists m\u2217T > 0\nsuch that e\u2212dl\u03c3B(m) > dmm when m < m\u2217T and e\n\u2212dl\u03c3B(m) < dmm when\nm > m\u2217T .\n}\n(2.17)\nThe quantitym\u2217T > 0 in (2.17) is an equilibrium of (2.15), andmT (t)\u2192 m\u2217T as t\u2192\u221e,\nprovided mT (\u03b8) \u2265 0 and mT (\u03b8) \u0006\u2261 0 on \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c3, 0] (see Kuang [14]). Accordingly,\n(2.16) is asymptotically autonomous, and we may replace mT (t) by m\n\u2217\nT in (2.16),\nthereby lowering the order of the system to be studied, which we now note consists\nof (2.9), (2.10), (2.13), and (2.14) together with\ndmi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212dmmi(t) + \u03b2m(m\u2217T \u2212mi(t))(Ji(t) + \u03b1Ai(t)),(2.18)\nwhich is the asymptotically autonomous limiting form of (2.16). Note that this sys-\ntem does not explicitly involve the delay \u03c3, but this delay is still involved via the\nquantity m\u2217T .\n414 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\n2.1. Positivity of solutions. We will prove that the system consisting of (2.9),\n(2.10), (2.13), (2.14), and (2.18) has a positivity preserving property. It is easy to ap-\npreciate that this system cannot have a positivity preserving property for completely\narbitrary nonnegative initial data (a glance at the terms in the right-hand side of\n(2.14) makes this clear). However, positivity preservation does hold when some com-\nponents of the initial data satisfy certain relations. These relations are easily seen to\nbe the only ones that make sense ecologically and therefore are easily admitted. We\ntherefore now append to the above-mentioned system the following initial data:\nAs(\u03b8) = A\n0\ns(\u03b8) \u2265 0, \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0],\nmi(\u03b8) = m\n0\ni (\u03b8) \u2208 [0,m\u2217T ], \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0],\nAi(0) = A\n0\ni (0) \u2265 0,\nJs(0) =\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\nb(A0s(\u03be)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b 0\n\u03be\n[dsj + \u03b2jm\n0\ni (u)] du\n)\nd\u03be,\nJi(0) =\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\nb(A0s(\u03be))\n{\u222b 0\n\u03be\n\u03b2jm\n0\ni (\u03b7)e\ndij\u03b7e\u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u03be\n[dsj+\u03b2jm\n0\ni (v)] dvd\u03b7\n}\nd\u03be,\n(2.19)\nwhere A0s(\u03b8) and m\n0\ni (\u03b8) are prescribed continuous functions of the variable \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0],\nand A0i (0) is also a given value. Note that Js(0) and Ji(0) have to be calculated from\nthe initial data for As and mi. This is ecologically reasonable; after all, Js(0) is\nthe number of juvenile susceptibles at time t = 0. The integral on the right in the\nexpression for Js(0) is simply accounting for all these juvenile susceptibles at t = 0.\nEach one was born at some time \u03be \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0]\u2014hence the presence of the birth rate\nb(A0s(\u03be))\u2014and each has to have survived and remained susceptible until time 0, hence\nthe exponential term which represents the probability of this actually happening.\nThe interpretation of the expression for Ji(0) is similar but more complicated. Of\nthe infected juveniles Ji(0) at time 0, each one was born at some time \u03be \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] as\na susceptible, and each of these newborns at time \u03be then became infected at some\nsubsequent time \u03b7 \u2208 [\u03be, 0].\nWe will now prove the following positivity preservation result.\nProposition 2.1. Let (2.17) hold. Then each component of the solution of the\nsystem consisting of (2.9), (2.10), (2.13), (2.14), and (2.18) for t > 0, subject to the\ninitial conditions (2.19), remains nonnegative for all t > 0. Also, mi(t) \u2264 m\u2217T for all\nt > 0. If, furthermore, the function b is bounded, then each component of the above\nsolution is also bounded for all t > 0.\nProof. First we will show that mi(t) \u2264 m\u2217T for all t > 0. Suppose the contrary;\nthen there must exist a time t1 such thatmi(t1) = m\n\u2217\nT and dmi(t1)\/dt \u2265 0. Evaluating\n(2.18) at time t1 immediately gives a contradiction.\nNext we prove nonnegativity of As(t), for t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ] in the \ufb01rst instance. On this\ninterval,\ndAs(t)\ndt\n\u2265 \u2212dsaAs(t)\u2212 \u03b2ami(t)As(t).\nBy comparison, As(t) is bounded below by the solution of the corresponding di\ufb00er-\nential equation obtained by replacing \u2265 by =, and this di\ufb00erential equation contains\na factor of As(t) in its right-hand side. Since As(0) \u2265 0, it follows that As(t) \u2265 0\nfor all t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ]. This argument can be continued using the method of steps, and we\nconclude that As(t) \u2265 0 for all t > 0.\nSPREAD OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 415\nNonnegativity of Js(t) will be shown next. This can be seen by noting that the\nsolution of (2.10), subject to the initial value for Js(0) given in (2.19), is\nJs(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nb(As(\u03be)) exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b t\n\u03be\n[dsj + \u03b2jmi(u)] du\n)\nd\u03be,(2.20)\nwhich is nonnegative because As is nonnegative.\nWe still have to prove the nonnegativity of Ai(t), Ji(t), and mi(t). It will be\nhelpful to note that the solution of (2.14), subject to the initial value for Ji(0) given\nin (2.19), is\nJi(t) =\n\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nb(As(\u03be))\n{\u222b t\n\u03be\n\u03b2jmi(\u03b7)e\n\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03b7)e\u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u03be\n[dsj+\u03b2jmi(v)] dvd\u03b7\n}\nd\u03be,(2.21)\nwhich is nonnegative if mi(t) is nonnegative. Therefore, it su\ufb03ces to prove non-\nnegativity of Ai(t) and mi(t). These two functions can be viewed as the solution\n(Ai(t),mi(t)) of the system of di\ufb00erential equations consisting of (2.13) and\ndmi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212dmmi(t) + \u03b2m(m\u2217T \u2212mi(t))\n\u00d7\n(\u222b t\nt\u2212\u03c4\nb(As(\u03be))\n{\u222b t\n\u03be\n\u03b2jmi(\u03b7)e\n\u2212dij(t\u2212\u03b7)e\u2212\n\u222b \u03b7\n\u03be\n[dsj+\u03b2jmi(v)] dvd\u03b7\n}\nd\u03be + \u03b1Ai(t)\n)\n(2.22)\nfor t > 0, with initial data taken from (2.19), but with As(t) thought of simply as\nsome prescribed nonnegative function. Recalling that mi(t) \u2264 m\u2217T , we now note that,\neven though this system does not satisfy a quasi monotonicity condition, Theorem 2.1\nof Smith [23, p. 81] is applicable and gives us the nonnegativity of Ai(t) and mi(t)\nimmediately. The proof of the nonnegativity of each component of the solution is\nthen complete.\nThe boundedness of As(t) is simple since, by (2.9),\nd\ndt\nAs(t) \u2264 bsup \u2212 dsaAs(t)\u2212 \u03b2ami(t)As(t),\nwhere bsup = supA\u22650 b(A) < \u221e. The boundedness of Ai(t) follows from (2.13) and\nthe boundedness of mi(t). The boundedness of Js(t) and Ji(t) follows from (2.20)\nand (2.21) directly. This completes the proof.\n2.2. Global convergence to disease-free state. In this section we shall prove\na theorem giving su\ufb03cient conditions for the system to evolve to the disease-free state\n(i.e., conditions that ensure Ai, Ji, and mi go to zero as t\u2192\u221e). Since the di\ufb00erential\nequations (2.10) and (2.14) can be solved to give (2.20) and (2.21), respectively, it is\nsu\ufb03cient to study the system consisting of (2.9), (2.13), and (2.22), with initial data\ntaken from (2.19). These equations form a closed system for As(t), Ai(t), and mi(t).\nOur aim will be to establish, using these three equations, a di\ufb00erential inequality\nfor the variable mi(t) only, and to use this to \ufb01nd conditions which ensure that\nmi(t)\u2192 0 as t\u2192\u221e. Note that if mi(t)\u2192 0, then from (2.21) it follows immediately\nthat Ji(t)\u2192 0 and, furthermore, (2.13) then becomes an asymptotically autonomous\nODE, from which it is easily seen that Ai(t) tends to zero.\n416 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\nWe will make certain assumptions concerning the birth rate function b(\u00b7) for hosts.\nThese assumptions are\nb(0) = 0, b(A) > 0 when A > 0, bsup := supA\u22650 b(A) < \u221e, there exists\nA\u2217s > 0 such that e\n\u2212dsj\u03c4 b(A) > dsaA when A < A\u2217s and e\n\u2212dsj\u03c4 b(A) <\ndsaA when A > A\n\u2217\ns.\n\u23ab\u23ac\n\u23ad(2.23)\nThese assumptions are not the same as those for the birth rate function B(\u00b7) for\nmosquitoes (assumptions (2.17)); note in particular that we do not require b(\u00b7) to be\nmonotone.\nThe reader will realize that the quantity A\u2217s in (2.23) is, in fact, a nonzero equi-\nlibrium value for As(t) in the case when the disease is absent. Assumptions (2.23)\nare geared towards ensuring that the population As(t) of adult susceptible hosts does\nnot go to zero even without the disease; otherwise the model is not interesting. This\nis important because if e\u2212dsj\u03c4 b(A) < dsaA for all A > 0 (which means that, in the\nabsence of the disease, adult recruitment of susceptible hosts is insu\ufb03cient to o\ufb00set\nnatural death of adult susceptible hosts), then it is natural to expect that As(t)\u2192 0\neven without the disease, and this can be mathematically shown to be the case, using\n(2.9).\nWe will prove the following theorem.

Let (2.17) and (2.23) hold, and let As(t), Ai(t), and mi(t) satisfy\n(2.9), (2.13), and (2.22), with initial data taken from (2.19).

It is satis\ufb01ed, for example, when the contact rates \u03b2a, \u03b2j , and \u03b2m are\nsu\ufb03ciently small, or when the mosquito capacity m\u2217T is su\ufb03ciently small. These are\nsituations in which we intuitively expect the theorem to hold. As such, an obvious\ncontrol measure for achieving disease eradication is to reduce the mosquito capacity.\nReducing \u03b2m is an alternative approach.\nProof of Theorem 2.2.

If (2.23) holds, then the\nmodel (2.9), (2.10), (2.13), (2.14), and (2.18) has a disease-free equilibrium (DFE),\nobtained by substituting Ji = 0, Ai = 0, and mi = 0 into the right-hand sides of\nthose equations and setting them to zero, given by\nE0 = (A\n\u2217\ns, J\n\u2217\ns , 0, 0, 0),(2.35)\nwhere A\u2217s > 0 and J\n\u2217\ns > 0 are given by\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\nb(A\u2217s)e\n\u2212dsj\u03c4 \u2212 dsaA\u2217s = 0,\nJ\u2217s =\nb(A\u2217s)\ndsj\n(1\u2212 e\u2212dsj\u03c4 ).(2.36)\nThe previous section of this paper presented su\ufb03cient conditions for disease eradi-\ncation (Theorem 2.2). In this section we investigate the linear stability of the DFE\nE0 to gain further insight, and we shall present a condition (namely, condition (2.38)\nbelow) which is both necessary and su\ufb03cient for E0 to be linearly stable. Though\nwe do not establish disease eradication globally under this particular condition, it is\nclearly the weakest possible condition for disease eradication.\nWe \ufb01rst require the following simple preliminary result, which provides a condition\nfor the linear stability of the DFE E0 to perturbations in which the disease remains\nabsent.\n420 STEPHEN A.

Obviously, (A\u2217s, J\n\u2217\ns ) is an equilibrium of system (2.37). The linearization\nof (2.37) at this equilibrium has solutions of the form exp(\u03bbt) whenever \u03bb satis\ufb01es\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212\u03bb\u2212 dsj b\u2032(A\u2217s)(1\u2212 e\u2212(\u03bb+dsj)\u03c4 )0 \u2212\u03bb\u2212 dsa + b\u2032(A\u2217s)e\u2212(\u03bb+dsj)\u03c4\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = 0.\nTherefore, (A\u2217s, J\n\u2217\ns ) is a locally stable solution of (2.37) if and only if all the roots \u03bb\nof \u2212\u03bb \u2212 dsa + b\u2032(A\u2217s)e\u2212(\u03bb+dsj)\u03c4 = 0 have negative real part. It is straightforward to\nshow that this is the case if dsa > |b\u2032(A\u2217s)|e\u2212dsj\u03c4 . The proof is complete.\nOur main result of this section is the following theorem, which gives a necessary\nand su\ufb03cient condition for the linear stability of the disease-free state.\nTheorem 2.4.

The hypotheses of Theorem 2.4 are the weakest possible hypotheses that\ncan guarantee the stated result. Recall from earlier remarks that if (2.17) or (2.23) is\nviolated, then the mosquito or host population is doomed, irrespective of the disease.\nIf the two sides of (2.38) are equal, then zero is an eigenvalue of the characteristic\nequation of the linearization about E0 ((2.40) below), signaling the bifurcation of an\nendemic equilibrium. As will be shown numerically at the end of this section, a Hopf\nbifurcation of periodic solutions may further bifurcate from this endemic equilibrium.\nIt remains a challenging problem to determine whether the hypotheses of Theorem 2.4\nare su\ufb03cient to guarantee the global stability of E0.\nProof.

This, together with the matching condition (2.19), gives\nJs(0) = 16700 and Ji(0) = 0.\nIn Figure 1 the condition (2.38) is satis\ufb01ed, and the infected populations go\nto zero. However, as we increase the contact rates, the condition (2.38) fails, and\nthe disease sustains in the bird and mosquito population, as shown in Figure 2. If\nwe continue to increase the contact rates, we eventually \ufb01nd oscillatory behaviors,\nas shown in Figure 3, suggesting the possibility of a Hopf bifurcation to periodic\nsolutions.\nSPREAD OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 423\nTable 1\nMeaning of parameters.\nParameter Meaning of the parameter Value\nbb Maximum per capita daily bird production rate 0.5\n1\/ab Size of bird population at which 1000\nthe number of newborn birds is maximized\nbm Maximum per capita daily mosquito egg production rate 5\n1\/am Size of mosquito population at which egg laying is maximized 10000\ndsj Mortality rate of uninfected juveniles (per day) 0.005\ndij Mortality rate of infected juveniles (per day) 0.05\ndsa Mortality rate of uninfected adults (per day) 0.0025\ndia Mortality rate of infected adults (per day) 0.015\ndm Mortality rate of mosquito (per day) 0.05\n\u03b2j Contact rate between uninfected juvenile and infected mosquito Variable\n\u03b2a Contact rate between uninfected adult and infected mosquito Variable\n\u03b2m Contact rate between uninfected mosquito and infected juvenile Variable\n\u03b1\u03b2m Contact rate between uninfected mosquito and infected juvenile Variable\n\u03c4 Duration of more vulnerable period of bird (day) 160\n\u03c3 Maturation time of mosquito (day) 10\ndl Mortality rate of larva mosquito (per day) 0.1\n3.

Set\ni\u03be(a, x) = i(\u03be + a, a, x).\nSince the calculation of i(t, \u03c4, x) involves immature ages a \u2208 [0, \u03c4 ] only, from (3.2) we\nobtain\n\u2202i\u03be\n\u2202a\n= Dij\n\u22022i\u03be\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 diji\u03be(a, x) + \u03b2jmi(\u03be + a, x)s(\u03be + a, a, x).\nThe solution of this equation satisfying the second condition in (3.6) is\ni\u03be(a, x) = \u03b2j\n\u222b a\n0\ne\u2212dij(a\u2212\u03b6)\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0393(Dij(a\u2212 \u03b6), x\u2212 y)mi(\u03be + \u03b6, y)s(\u03be + \u03b6, \u03b6, y) dy d\u03b6,\nwhere \u0393 is again given by (3.8). For s(\u03be + \u03b6, \u03b6, y) we use expression (3.7). Then,\nsetting a = \u03c4 and \u03be = t \u2212 \u03c4 in the above expression gives us i(t, \u03c4, x), and thus we\nconclude that the evolution PDE for the variable Ai(t, x) representing the number of\nadult infected hosts is, for t \u2265 \u03c4 ,\n\u2202Ai\n\u2202t\n= Dia\n\u22022Ai\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 diaAi(t, x) + \u03b2ami(t, x)As(t, x)\n+ \u03b2j\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\ne\u2212dij(\u03c4\u2212\u03b6)\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0393(Dij(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b6), x\u2212 y)mi(t\u2212 \u03c4 + \u03b6, y)\n\u00d7\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0393(Dsj\u03b6, y \u2212 \u03b7)b(As(t\u2212 \u03c4, \u03b7))e\u2212dsj\u03b6 d\u03b7 dy d\u03b6.\n(3.11)\nThis is again valid only in the far \ufb01eld x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, since we have used expression\n(3.7). The last term in the right-hand side of (3.11) is the rate at which infected\nimmatures become infected adults and has a similar interpretation to a term in the\nright-hand side of (2.13). This time the term involves additional integrals because of\ndi\ufb00usion, but the reader may notice that in certain other respects the term in (3.11)\nis a little simpler than we might expect based on comparison with (2.13); this is due\nto the approximations we have made to derive (3.11) because of the restriction to the\nx \u2248 \u2212\u221e zone. The interpretation of the term we are discussing is as follows. Each\nindividual that reaches adulthood at point x at time t as an infected individual was\nborn as a susceptible at time t \u2212 \u03c4 at some other point \u03b7.

As explained previously, we shall look for solutions which constitute a leftward\nmoving traveling wave-front and which invade what was formerly a disease-free zone;\nin other words, as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e we shall assume that the variables tend to the disease-\nfree values in which Ai, Ji, and mi are zero while A\n\u2217\ns > 0 and J\n\u2217\ns > 0 are given by\n(2.36), assuming that (2.23) holds. (If (2.23) does not hold, then the host population\nis eradicated even in the absence of the disease.)\nWe shall, in fact, look for a wave-front that constitutes a transition from the\ndisease-free state to an endemic steady state, and so we need to be assured of the\nexistence of an endemic state. The endemic state cannot be found explicitly, but\nfortunately we know the condition for its existence. This condition is the opposite\nof (2.38).

It is therefore\nnecessary that there should exist at least one strictly positive real root \u03bb of the\ncharacteristic equation (3.15) with the property that the corresponding eigenvector\n(q1, q2, q3) points into the positive octant in R\n3. This actually happens only for c\nabove some minimum value cmin > 0. De\ufb01ne\ncmin = inf{c : \u2203\u03bb \u2208 (0, 12Dia (c+\n\u221a\nc2 + 4diaDia)] satisfying (3.15)}.(3.19)\nThe reason why the search for positive real roots \u03bb of (3.15) is con\ufb01ned to the \ufb01nite\ninterval in (3.19) is that the eigenvector (q1, q2, q3) corresponding to an eigenvalue\n\u03bb exceeding 12Dia (c +\n\u221a\nc2 + 4diaDia) has q1 and q3 of opposite sign (implying that\none of Ai or mi is negative) so that such an eigenvalue corresponds to an infeasible\nsolution. Note that the interval of \u03bb in (3.19) is c dependent.\nA calculation shows that, because of (3.14),\nG1(0; c)\u2212G2(0; c)G3(0; c) > 0.\nIf for a \ufb01xed c one plots the graph of G1(\u03bb; c) \u2212 G2(\u03bb; c)G3(\u03bb; c) against \u03bb on the\nfeasible domain \u03bb \u2208 [0, 12Dia (c+\n\u221a\nc2 + 4diaDia)], one \ufb01nds that for a very small value\nof c the graph is always above the horizontal axis. The e\ufb00ect of increasing c is that a\nminimum begins to form within the feasible domain, and this minimum moves down\nand touches the horizontal axis at a critical c, the value cmin de\ufb01ned in (3.19) above.\nFigure 4 shows the critical situation for a particular set of parameter values shown\nin the caption, and for the two birth functions b(\u00b7) and B(\u00b7) chosen as in section 2.4.\nThe value cmin can be found by numerically solving the simultaneous equations\nG1(\u03bb; c)\u2212G2(\u03bb; c)G3(\u03bb; c) = 0,\nd\nd\u03bb\n[G1(\u03bb; c)\u2212G2(\u03bb; c)G3(\u03bb; c)] = 0,\nfor c and \u03bb with c > 0 and \u03bb \u2208 (0, 12Dia (c+\n\u221a\nc2 + 4diaDia)].\n4. Discussion. The minimum speed of spread computed in the previous section\naccording to the predictions of the linearized analysis was about 2.62 km\/day, i.e.,\nabout 956 km\/year. This is certainly roughly consistent with the speed at which\nWest Nile virus has spread across the USA. The disease \ufb01rst emerged in New York in\n1999 and had reached the West coast \ufb01ve years later. We should point out, however,\nthat there is some uncertainty regarding the choice of parameter values, especially the\ndi\ufb00usivities. We have availed ourselves of what data there is concerning the di\ufb00usivity\nof adult crows, but our choice of a value for the \ufb02edgling crows, which do not \ufb02y so well\nand may well spend some time on the ground (where they are, of course, vulnerable\nto predators such as cats) is purely our estimate. While the speed of spread does\nshow a dependence on the di\ufb00usivities, we noted a lack of sensitivity to the values of\n430 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25\nlambda\nFig. 4. Parameter values are \u03b2j = 3.15\u00d7 10\u22125, \u03b2a = 1.5\u00d7 10\u22125, \u03b2m = 2.925\u00d7 10\u22125, \u03b1\u03b2m =\n0.75\u00d710\u22125, Dia = 13 km2\/day [16, 21] (the di\ufb00usion rate of infected adult), Dij = 6 km2\/day (the\ndi\ufb00usion rate of infected juvenile), Dm = 0.1 km2\/day (the di\ufb00usion rate of mosquito), and other\nparameters have the values shown in Table 1. For these values, the minimum speed cmin, computed\nas described in the text, equals 2.623164094 km\/day.\nsome of them (e.g., the di\ufb00usivity of mosquitoes) and a sensitivity to the values of\nother parameters, particularly the contact rates.\nIdeally it would be desirable to have some information on whether the minimum\nspeed cmin computed as described in section 3 is really the speed that solutions would\nevolve to, from ecologically realistic initial data such as a localized introduction of\ninfectives. One must remember that in deriving the reaction-di\ufb00usion model, we\nwere restricted to the vicinity of the DFE because the model derivation requires an\nexplicit solution to a certain linear parabolic PDE that is nonautonomous except\nnear that equilibrium. The inability to formulate a model that is valid everywhere\nin the spatial domain has made it impossible to numerically simulate the spatially\nextended model (such a simulation might have con\ufb01rmed that the spread rate is\nindeed the minimal wave speed cmin). The mathematical theory of the speed of\nspread in reaction-di\ufb00usion equations with functional terms is still far from complete,\nespecially for coupled systems such as those in this paper. Relating the spread rate of\nthe disease to the traveling wave with the minimal wave speed relies on the so-called\nlinear conjecture (see [25, 15]). The fact that the minimal speed coincides with the\nspread rate has been theoretically veri\ufb01ed only for dynamical systems enjoying certain\norder-preserving properties (see the two recent articles [24, 17]), and counterexamples\nwhen these properties do not hold have been reported [11]. Establishing this fact for\nour system (3.9)\u2013(3.13) is even more di\ufb03cult due to the interaction of time delay and\nspatial di\ufb00usion, in addition to the nonlocality of the nonlinear terms. Therefore,\nit has to be emphasized that our calculation of cmin is nothing more than a formal\ncalculation of the minimum ecologically feasible speed according to the linearized\nequations ahead of the front.\nThroughout this paper simple mass action terms have been used. In some virus\ninfections, possibly including mosquito borne disease, one might argue for the inclusion\nof a term which represents the fact that a female mosquito takes a \ufb01xed number of\nblood meals per unit time (Anderson and May [1]). Such a modi\ufb01cation involves\ndividing by bird density and has recently been utilized by Lewis, Renclawowicz, and\nSPREAD OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES 431\nvan den Driessche [16] and by Bowman et al. [3] in some simpler models for West\nNile virus. In the present paper such a modi\ufb01cation can be implemented only in the\nmodel without di\ufb00usion, which we have studied in section 2, and unfortunately not\nfor the reaction-di\ufb00usion model of section 3, which becomes intractable. The type of\nmodi\ufb01cation we are discussing involves replacing (2.1) by\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202s\n\u2202a\n= \u2212ds(a)s(t, a)\u2212 \u03b2(a)s(t, a)mi(t)\nN(t)\n,(4.1)\nwith another similar modi\ufb01cation to (2.2). The variable N(t) stands for the total bird\npopulation,\nN(t) = As(t) +Ai(t) + Js(t) + Ji(t),\nin which the variables are de\ufb01ned by (2.5). Equation (2.18) would be replaced by\ndmi(t)\ndt\n= \u2212dmmi(t) + \u03b2m(m\n\u2217\nT \u2212mi(t))\nN(t)\n(Ji(t) + \u03b1Ai(t)).(4.2)\nFor this modi\ufb01ed model it is possible to develop a parallel theory including equa-\ntions for the total number variables analogous to (2.9), (2.10), (2.13), (2.14) and to\nprove theorems concerning positivity, boundedness, and global convergence. We shall\ncon\ufb01ne ourselves in this paragraph only to a discussion of the linear stability of the\nDFE in the modi\ufb01ed model involving division by bird density. The DFE itself is still\ngiven precisely by (2.35). Lemma 2.3, which concerns stability to perturbations in\nwhich the disease remains absent, still holds. For the modi\ufb01ed model a necessary and\nsu\ufb03cient condition for the DFE to be linearly asymptotically stable to arbitrary small\nperturbations is\ndm >\n\u03b2mm\n\u2217\nT\nN\u2217\n{\nb(A\u2217s)\u03b2j\nN\u2217(dij \u2212 dsj)\n[\n1\u2212 e\u2212dsj\u03c4\ndsj\n\u2212 (1\u2212 e\n\u2212dij\u03c4 )\ndij\n]\n+\n\u03b1\ndiaN\u2217\n[\n\u03b2aA\n\u2217\ns + \u03b2jb(A\n\u2217\ns)e\n\u2212dsj\u03c4 (1\u2212 e\u2212(dij\u2212dsj)\u03c4 )\ndij \u2212 dsj\n]}\n,\n(4.3)\nwhich is similar to condition (2.38). Here, N\u2217 = A\u2217s + J\n\u2217\ns , where A\n\u2217\ns and J\n\u2217\ns are given\nby (2.36).\nThere are a number of ways in which one could interpret conditions (2.38) and\n(4.3) for the simple mass action model and the modi\ufb01ed model, respectively. First\nlet us note that as far as the stability of the DFE is concerned the two models are\nsimilar: to get from one to the other we simply divide the contact rates by the\ntotal bird population at the equilibrium. Not surprisingly, in reality in the control\nof West Nile virus a great deal of emphasis goes into mosquito control. This may\nmean larval control, i.e., reducing the number of places mosquito larvae may inhabit\nsuch as old tires, blocked gutters, bird baths, \ufb02ower pots, swimming pool covers,\netc. Adult mosquito control using adulticides, which are sprayed into the air from a\nsprayer truck as very tiny droplets, is also practiced, especially when larval control\nmeasures are clearly inadequate or disease is imminent. The per capita mortality\nrate for adult mosquitoes manifests itself in our model as the parameter dm. The\nper capita mortality rate for mosquito larvae is dl, which does not feature directly\nin (2.38) or (4.3) but features indirectly through the quantity m\u2217T . (In fact, m\n\u2217\nT\ndepends on both dl and dm.) If the birth function B(\u00b7) for mosquitoes is chosen as\n432 STEPHEN A. GOURLEY, RONGSONG LIU, AND JIANHONG WU\nin (2.44), then m\u2217T =\n1\nam\nln(bm\/dm)\u2212 dl\u03c3\/am, and so the right-hand side of (2.38) or\n(4.3) decreases linearly with dl so that su\ufb03ciently e\ufb00ective larval control eradicates\nthe disease. On the other hand, as dm increases, the left-hand side increases linearly\nwhile the right-hand side decreases, suggesting that in percentage terms an increase\nin dm might be more e\ufb00ective than an increase in larval mortality dl. However, adult\nmosquito control is more expensive and more di\ufb03cult to organize.\nThere are a number of other factors we have not considered in this paper at all.\nIt seems that in reality seasonal e\ufb00ects probably play an important role and should\nbe modeled. It is really only in the breeding season that crows, once paired, seek to\nestablish individual territories to raise their broods. In the nonbreeding season crow\nactivities tend to be centered around large communal roosts to which they return in\nthe evenings after searching for food during the day (some roost locations may have\nbeen gathering points for crows for many decades). Crows also have a strong \ufb02ocking\ninstinct, something which Fickian di\ufb00usion does not model at all. Northern birds\ntend to \ufb02y south during the winter. All these considerations indicate possible areas\nfor further investigation.\nAcknowledgment.
