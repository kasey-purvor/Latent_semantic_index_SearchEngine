The report was a shot in the\narm for the Hindu right. Ignoring critical voices or char-\nacterizing them as products of Babri-mosque historians,\nanti-national leftists, and desperate secularists who can-\nnot face the \u201chistorical truth,\u201d militants such as Praveen\nTogadia of the VHP have appealed to Muslims to give\nup their claim to the disputed site, thereby proving that\nthey want to live like brothers with the Hindus, or risk\nprovoking further confrontation that might well lead to\n\u201ccivil war.\u201d\nrobin coningham\nDepartment of Archaeological Sciences, University of\nBradford, West Yorkshire BD7 1DP, U.K. (r.a.e.\nconingham@bradford.ac.uk). 12 xi 03\nIn 1992 the Babri mosque at Ayodhya was destroyed by\na lethal cocktail of religious tradition, political oppor-\ntunism, and the failure of the instruments of the state;\nthe incident divided archaeologists in India into three\ngroups. The first two are in polar positions, those who\nhold that there is archaeological evidence that a temple\nmarking the birthplace of the god Rama was destroyed\nso that a Mughal mosque could be erected (Lal 2002),\nand those who hold that there is no such evidence (Man-\ndal 2002 [1993]). The third group is the most numerous\nbut least vocal and contains archaeologists who believe\nthat their profession should have no role in the politics\nof modern India. That archaeology has such a role is now\nundeniable, as in March 2003 the Allahabad High Court\ndirected the Archaeological Survey of India to excavate\nthe site and resolve the \u201ctemple\u201d issue.\nThere is a possibility that the mosque did replace an\nearlier temple, as there are well-known examples of such\nchanges. Delhi\u2019s Q\u2019tab Minar complex, for example, in-\ncorporates pillars from a demolished temple. Equally\nconvincing is the mosque at Bambhore in Pakistan,\nwhose foundations include a lingam, the phallic embod-\niment of the god Siva. This phenomenon is not restricted\nto South Asia; examples include the conversion of Is-\ntanbul\u2019s Hagia Sophia from a church to a mosque and\nAthens\u2019s Parthenon from a temple of Athena to a church.\nReceiving legitimation and power, those making the\nchanges undoubtedly tapped into the proximity of a sa-\ncred location. Thus, for me, the issue of whether the\nBabri mosque was or was not built on the ruins of a\nearlier temple is not the central issue of the conflict,\nwhether the court believes it to be so or not.\nMany commentators, Ratnagar included, attribute a\nnumber of South Asia\u2019s social and political woes to Brit-\nish policy, suggesting that colonial archaeology was po-\nlitical. I am in broad agreement, but it would be erro-\nneous to ignore the role that archaeology played for the\nindependence movement. The discovery of the Harappan\ncivilization in the 1920s demonstrated the presence of a\nvast, literate, and urban society millennia before such\ndevelopments in Europe, and the selection of a third-\ncentury-b.c. Asokan pillar capital as the new state\u2019s crest\nunderlines its attempts to gain legitimation from the past\n(Coningham and Lewer 2000). However, the issue of\nwhether colonial\/post-Partition archaeology in India\nwas\/is political is, again, not for me the central issue of\nthe conflict.\nThe central issue is that of restitution; that is, to which\ngroup\/identity should the site be handed? The answer to\nthis question is complex, the more so because South\nAsia\u2019s social and religious identities had fluid or, in Rat-\nnagar\u2019s words, \u201cfuzzy\u201d boundaries in the past. Tidy-\nminded colonial administrators created long-lasting\ndamage because they would accept only single identities.\nFor example, previously mobile castes were formally or-\nganized, censuses encouraged single religious entries\n(Coningham 2001), and Curzon attempted to remove the\nHindu incumbent of Bodhgaya because the British vice-\nroy identified it as Buddhist, not Buddhist-Hindu (Lahiri\n1999). Such approaches were clearly inappropriate for\nSouth Asia, where Buddhist monuments, for example,\nwere patronized not just by Buddhists but by individuals\nbelonging to other faiths and where the religious affili-\nation of many archaeological monuments is unclear for\nsimilar reasons.\n\u201cFuzzy\u201d boundaries still exist in South Asia at Lum-\nbini, the birthplace of the Gautama Buddha. This\nUNESCO World Heritage Site was identified only in\n1899 in ruins surrounding a small Hindu shrine. The\nsculpture of the resident goddess was soon recognized as\na partial sculpture of the Buddha\u2019s mother and the shrine\nrebuilt around it. Annually, the site is visited by\nthousands of Hindus and Buddhists of many different\nsects, but conflict has been avoided by keeping the core\nmonument as a sacred garden marked only by archaeo-\nlogical ruins and a non-denominational shrine, whilst\nbuildings of formal religious affiliation are reserved for\nthe surrounding precinct. The irony is, of course, that\nLumbini is located in Nepal, the only official Hindu\ncountry in the world, whose king has recently been pro-\nclaimed Chakravartin or \u201cuniversal ruler.\u201d\nThe Ayodhya incident is not unique, and it is possible\nto trace a very worrying acceleration of the destruction\nof sites of archaeological and religious significance in\nSouth Asia. The destruction of the Babri mosque in 1992\nand the Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001 are two well-known\ncases, but equally disturbing was the suicide bombing of\nthe Temple of the Buddha\u2019s Tooth in Sri Lanka, a\nUNESCO World Heritage site, in 1998 (Coningham and\nLewer 1999). If the Archaeological Survey of India and\nthe courts are not to be bound up by decades of claims\nand counterclaims at every site of cultural and religious\nimportance in India, the only solution is a Lumbini-style\nplan. Whilst the ASI can only offer archaeological evi-\ndence, the courts must provide a solution not just for\nIndia but also for South Asia as a whole.\n"}
