Unfortunately, this picture is allowed \nto dictate the whole chronology of the site. The pottery is all attributed to the 13th \nand earlier 14th century, reinforcing the picture of later decline and in spite of recent \nfindings at Dublin or Trim. This focus on the period before 1350 affects the chronol-\nogy of the buildings, with the assertion (p 189) that the earlier 13th century was likely \nto see more building because that was when the Priory was receiving donations; as \nopposed to later when the endowments were organised and producing income. It is clear \nthat there was a lot of building, from a tower south of the choir interpreted as lodging \nfor the Prior, to ranges south of the cloister, which took place later. The general treat-\nment of the buildings is weak. Interestingly, the excavations found the remains of an \nearlier church, later expanded to the east, west and south. Sadly, the evidence for this \n\u2014 itself a major discovery \u2014 is not brought together and the plan of it is small and \nsketchy. The story of the western extension of the church, a NW tower, the cloister and \nits W range is, from a glance at the plan, complex but the wall-junctions are neither \nillustrated nor discussed. There is a considerable amount of building preserved to \nfirst-floor level; but there are no plans of these upper levels. The most glaring omission \nis a discussion of the towers of the \u2018Prior\u2019s vill\u2019, the enclosure south of the precinct, \nwith no plans of their floors. They are simply dismissed as military in function, when \nthe monastic precinct lay unprotected to the west. The enclosure is a puzzle, but should \nbe seen far more in the context of an expansion of the town, with urban towers. There \nare, therefore, problems to this nicely produced volume which is somewhat limited in \nspite of its length; nonetheless it is still a report to be greatly welcomed.\ntom mcneill\nSt Peter\u2019s, Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire. A Parish Church and its Community. Volume 2. The \nHuman Remains. By Tony Waldron. 21x30 cm. viii + 193 pp, 7 colour and 98 b&w \npls and figs, 87 tables. Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2007. isbn 978-1-84217-283-4. Price: \n\u00a330.00 hb.\nThis book describes the data recorded from 2750 skeletons of people buried in \nthe cemetery associated with St Peter\u2019s church, Barton-upon-Humber. It complements \nnicely the account of the excavation and analysis of the nearby early-Anglo-Saxon \nnecropolis of Castledyke South (G Drinkall & M Foreman, The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at \nCastledyke South, Barton-upon-Humber, Sheffield, 1998). St Peter\u2019s cemetery was excavated \nbetween 1978 and 1984 with subsequent analysis being undertaken by Dr Juliet Rogers. \nFollowing her untimely death in 2001, her great friend and colleague, Tony Waldron, \ntook on the task of bringing Roger\u2019s work to publication. This was a monumental chal-\nlenge and for this Tony Waldron must be congratulated. This site is of great importance \nfor human bioarchaeologists, from a global perspective, providing analysis of the largest \nsample of skeletal remains outside London from an archaeological context. Such sample \nsizes provide a much more realistic view of the people they represent.\nThe book starts with \u2018An Appreciation\u2019 for Juliet, documenting her life in medi-\ncine, and then in human bioarchaeology, along with an account of the activities of a \n\u2018woman of many parts\u2019, plus a list of Juliet\u2019s publications. Two background chapters \nthen frame the church and its setting, and the burial archaeology. \u2018Burial Archaeology\u2019 \ndetails the orientation and depth of the graves, grave markers, bone condition, grave \n\u2018furniture\u2019, and the cemetery chronology (complete with detailed plans of the graves \nin each phase); this allows the reader to contextualise later chapters considering \nthe analysis of the skeletal remains. Chapter 3 (\u2018Assemblage\u2019) describes the number of \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\n429reviews\nindividuals analysed, divided into phases dating from Phase E (ad 950\u20131150) to Phase \nA (1700\u20131855), along with the condition of the skeletal material (completeness of the \nskeletons); there were eight skeletons who could be \u2018named\u2019, all dying in the early half \nof the 19th century. Being able to assign graves closely to phases is fairly unique in \nburial archaeology but allows the consideration of changes to the biological profile of \nthe buried population through time. Age at death and sex of each individual skeleton \nanalysed are presented, although specific methods used to assign ages and sexes are not \ngiven (eg skeletons were aged \u2018using standard methods and employing as many criteria \nas were available\u2019 \u2014 p 35). In the Notes for the Chapter some general references for \nageing methods are given but it would have been helpful if the specific methods used \nhad been properly referenced.\nChapter 4 (\u2018Physical Characteristics of the Assemblage\u2019) considers achieved height \n(stature), the rate of growth of the children at Barton, and three indices derived from \nmeasurements of the skull, femur and tibia. It would have been interesting to compare \ndata at Barton with heights from other medieval cemeteries to observe any differences. \nChapter 5 considers the frequency of some of the \u2018Non-metric characteristics\u2019 (or nor-\nmal variations in the appearance) of the bones of the skeleton; again some comparative \nanalysis would have been welcomed. Chapters 6\u201314 describe the evidence for disease in \nthe skeletons, with 6 and 7 covering the joint diseases \u2014 a field of expertise for both \nRogers and Waldron. There is great variation in how bioarchaeologists record osteoar-\nthritis (OA) of joints and present the data, with Rogers and Waldron preferring a more \nconservative approach (which I indeed favour) as opposed to those who, one fears, \nover-record frequency. As such, comparing data between sites can be very tricky if \nthe methods used differ. Furthermore, linking joint disease with specific occupations \nhas become common in bioarchaeology, a trend that Waldron has rightly warned is \ndangerous (see his Counting the Dead. The Epidemiology of Skeletal Populations, New York, \n1994). \nHowever, it is noted that a large proportion of young adults had OA at Barton, \nwhich Waldron suggests might indicate people starting strenuous activities at an early \nage; because the burials had been phased at Barton it was possible to see that OA gen-\nerally increased in the post-medieval period. Rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, \nReiter\u2019s Syndrome, gout, bunions and ankylosing spondylitis are all described, and \nunique preservation of calcified arteries in an adult male with psoriatic arthritis re-\nported. Chapter 8 describes evidence for infectious disease, and includes both those \ninfections caused by an organism that cannot be specifically identified (non-specific) and \nalso specific infections. Relatively little evidence emerges of infection but tuberculosis, \nwith a number of people with wasted bones (possibly caused by poliomyelitis leading to \nparalysis of limbs). Other non-specific inflammatory changes on bones at Barton include \nthe ribs (lung infection) and the sinuses (sinusitis) plus individuals with infected degener-\nated joints (septic arthritis). Despite leprosy and syphilis being present in England and \nScotland at the time of the creation of the cemetery at Barton, there was no skeletal \nevidence for these.\nChapter 9 describes trauma evidence. We learn fractures occurred more in females \nand increased from the earlier to later period. The data include the observation that \nover 150 people had 186 fractures, ribs were the most frequently fractured bone, eight \nadults (one female) and two juveniles sustained skull fractures (all healed), six people \nhad dislocated joints, nearly 50 skeletons had spondylolysis, and 160 people had Schmorl\u2019s \nnodes. Metabolic disease evidence (osteoporosis, vitamin D deficiency, and Paget\u2019s \ndisease \u2014 15 people) is presented in Chapter 10. Surprisingly, osteoporosis was diag-\nnosed on \u2018the subjective feel or appearance of the bones\u2019 (p 95) which, because of \nchanges to bone structure\/weight as a result of post-mortem damage, is generally \nconsidered an inaccurate reflection of osteoporosis. Chapter 11 reflects the evidence for \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\n430 reviews\nthe bone-forming diseases, especially Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) \nwhich has been found in a higher frequency in monastic populations in England, \nand is associated today with older males, diabetes and obesity. Forty-one people were \naffected (32 males). Tumours, a rarity in the study of human remains, are considered \nin Chapter 12 and both benign and malignant tumours are recorded; as with other \nanalyses of cemetery samples, there were few people who suffered. Chapter 13 includes \npathological conditions under the headings of congenital and developmental, while the \nshort Chapter 14 describes dental disease, noting that almost 40% of people at Barton \nhad caries and nearly two-thirds had lost teeth ante-mortem. \nChapter 15 analyses the parish records associated with St Peter\u2019s and the \nneighbouring St Mary\u2019s church which lacks, unlike St Peter\u2019s, intrusive archaeological \nintervention. Baptisms and burial data were compared with the skeletal data. Unfortu-\nnately, the final concluding chapter is less than a page long but provides a few key \nfindings. It concludes that the Barton population lived in a \u2018stable environment . . . \n[were] adequately nourished, and their toll of disease was unremarkable\u2019 (p 129). \nHowever, Waldron cautions the conclusions with the problems inherent in any analysis \nof skeletal remains. Appendix 1 gives publications that have resulted from the skeletal \nanalysis and Appendix 2 provides a useful tabulated summary of the skeletons \nanalysed. \nBringing together data collected by another researcher is admirable, but there can \nbe limitations to what can be achieved, as seen in this book. I left feeling disappointed \nthat such a large assemblage had so little written about it; more comparative analysis \nwould have helped, and better (and more) referencing\/acknowledgement of relevant \npublished literature. The figures of pathological lesions are often of poor quality, \nalthough the graphical representations of data work well. However, the real value of \nthis book is that the data on the skeletons are now published and the report will provide \na basis from which other researchers will be able to develop research ideas that can be \ntackled by further work on this important skeletal sample, which is fortunately curated \nfor that future research. \ncharlotte roberts\nThe Churchyard.

Price: \u00a325.00 hb.\nIt is over 50 years since excavation started at Wharram Percy and the results of \nthe pioneering excavation of this site, encompassing over 30 archaeological seasons, \nhave been published in a series of monographs, the latest volume of which Wharram XI \nwhich focuses on the late-Saxon to post-medieval churchyard. The volume contains \na detailed phase-by-phase discussion of the excavation between 1962 and 1973 of the \ndifferent parts of the churchyard, combined which specialised reports on the finds \nincluding human bone, pottery and the small finds. The volume has been designed to \ncomplement the 1987 Wharram III volume on the church. Although 20 years separate \nthe two publications, this has in many ways been beneficial, allowing both use of ana-\nlytical techniques which were unavailable in the 1980s and also the reconsideration and \nreinterpretation of some of the material discussed in the earlier volume III. The down-\nside is that many of those who instigated and were closely linked with the project are \nno longer here to see the results of their labour, and the volume is prefaced by fond \nrecollections of the late Maurice Beresford. \n"}
