Introduction \n \nA key objective of the EC EURATOM funded ERICA project was to provide the necessary \nmethods to allow scientific, managerial and societal issues concerning environmental \nexposures to radiation to be dealt with in a robust and comprehensive manner. In order to \nachieve this The ERICA Integrated Approach combines elements of environmental \nmanagement, risk characterisation and impact assessment building on the foundations \ndeveloped during the preceding projects FASSET (Larsson, 2004) and EPIC (Brown et al., \n2003). Central to the ERICA integrated approach is the quantification of environmental risk \nwhereby data on environmental transfer and dosimetry are combined to provide a measure of \nexposure which is compared to exposure levels at which detrimental effects are known to \noccur. In view of the large data sets underpinning the assessment approach and the potential \nto introduce errors when performing numerous calculations by hand, a supporting computer-\nbased tool (the ERICA Tool) has been developed. \n \nThe assessment element of the ERICA Integrated Approach is organised in to three separate \ntiers, where satisfying certain criteria in Tiers 1 and 2 allows the user to exit the assessment \nwhile being confident that the effects on biota are low or negligible. Tier 3 provides the ability \nto consider situation of concern in more detail. The tiered approach is described briefly below \nand in detail in Beresford et al. (2007a) and  Larsson (this issue). The ERICA Tool is a user \nfriendly software programme that implements the tiered approach and guides the user through \nthe assessment process, recording information and decisions and allows the necessary \ncalculations to be performed to estimate risks to selected biota. A detailed manual (Tool Help) \nis provided within the software which, together with the description of the ERICA Integrated \nApproach (Beresford et al., 2007a), assists the user in making appropriate choices and inputs \nas well as in the interpretation of the outputs. \n \nThe software has been developed in Java, a widely used, platform independent programming \nlanguage (B\u00f8rretzen et al., 2005). The ERICA tool is designed to run on Java Runtime \nEnvironment Version 6 or higher. Within this article, the basic components of the Tool are \npresented, any assumptions associated with the derivation of key parameters are described and \nthe underlying calculations defined. \n \n \n2. The basis for the assessments: underpinning equations and databases \n \nThe ERICA assessment draws on the use of reference organisms as defined by Larsson \n(2004). As the starting point for the selection of appropriate reference organisms those \nselected for the FASSET Framework (see Strand et al., 2001) were considered. The selection \nprocess was primarily based on the identification of those biota that might be particularly \nexposed to radiation through a consideration of the biogeochemical behaviour (primarily \ntransfer and biological uptake) of 20 radionuclides within four terrestrial (i.e. forest, semi-\nnatural, agricultural and wetlands) and three aquatic (i.e. marine, freshwater and brackish) \necosystems (Strand et al., 2001). Some additional consideration was implicitly also paid to the \nanimal or plants\u2018 ecological niche, intrinsic sensitivity to chronic low-level irradiation and \necological significance in this selection process. These types of considerations can be made \nthrough review and evaluation of published data as described by Beresford et al. (2001).  The \ncomponent ecosystems were selected to be typical for Europe. Within the ERICA project the \noriginal list of reference organisms has been rationalised by amalgamating the terrestrial \necosystems into a single representative semi-natural ecosystem and by removing the brackish \necosystem which arguably constitutes a sub-set of the marine system. The rationalisation was \njustified, in part, because of the lack of radioecological data for some of the ecosystems (e.g. \nwetlands and brackish waters) and the cross use of data in others (e.g. semi-natural sourced \ndata from all terrestrial ecosystems) (Beresford et al. 2005). Furthermore, the original \nFASSET reference organism list has been amended to encompass the ICRPs proposed list of  \nReference animals and plants - RAPs (see ICRP, 2005). The definitive set of reference \norganisms has also been constructed to facilitate assessments species currently protected by \nEuropean legislation as these may be a focus within some assessments (e.g. Copplestone et al. \n2003). The requirement to cover European protected species led to the addition of some \nreference organism to the final list (e.g. marine reptiles, corals). An overview of the reference \norganisms and associated ecosystems considered by the ERICA Integrated Approach is \nprovided in Table 1. \n \nThe Tool includes default information for a suite of radionuclides selected to cover a wide \nvariety of conceivable exposure situations including those arising from routine authorised \ndischarge regimes, potential releases from repositories for radioactive waste, including High \nLevel Waste, operations involving NORM and accident scenarios. An overview of the \nradionuclides supported by the tool as default is presented in Table 2; additionally most \nradionuclides considered within ICRP (1983) can be assessed using the Tool (see Section 2.2 \nbelow). \n \nThe assessments carried out in different tiers include two basic calculation steps: i) estimation \nof the activity concentrations in biota and environmental media and ii) estimation of the dose \nrates to biota. The basic equations and parameters used in these calculations are described \nbelow. \n \n2.1 Estimation of activity concentrations  \nIf adequate measured data are unavailable, the activity concentrations of radionuclides in \nbiota within the ERICA tool are calculated by multiplying the corresponding media activity \nconcentrations (soil or air for terrestrial ecosystems and water for aquatic ecosystems) by \nequilibrium concentration ratios (CRs) as defined by Equation 1 or 2 for terrestrial ecosystems \nand Equation 3 for aquatic ecosystems. \nTerrestrial biota \n)dry weight kg (Bq  soilin ionconcentratActivity \n weight)fresh kg (Bqbody   wholebiota in ionconcentratActivity \n  CR\n1-\n-1\n  (1) \n \nExceptions are for chronic atmospheric releases of \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP and \n35\nS where: \n \n)m (Bq air in ionconcentratActivity \n weight)fresh kg (Bqbody   wholebiota in ionconcentratActivity \n  CR\n3-\n-1\n  (2) \nAquatic biota \n)l (Bq  waterfiltered of ionconcentratActivity  \n weight)fresh kg (Bqbody   wholebiota in ionconcentratActivity \n  CR\n1-\n-1\n  (3) \n \nDefault values of the concentration ratios are stored in the Tool transfer databases \n(\u2015Radioecology\u2016 database), providing a value for each element and reference organism, \noriginally in the format of Microsoft Excel. These, and all other, databases can be accessed \nvia the tool using the \u2015Show database\u2016 option under the \u2015Assessment\u2016 tab at the top of the \nscreen or by accessing the Excel spreadsheets stored under the folder \u2015My ERICA database\u2016. \nThe CR values included in the database were derived from reviews of original publications by \npreference. However, in numerous cases, no empirical data were available resulting in the \nderivation of values using various methods such as taxonomic and biogeochemical analogues. \nThese approaches are described in more detail by Beresford et al. (this issue) and Hosseini et \nal. (this issue). Of specific note, with regards to the characterisation of these data within the \ndefault transfer database, is the fact that the derivation method is cited allowing the assessor \nto identify how each default value was selected.  \nIt should be noted that the Tool, at Tiers 2 and 3, also allows for estimation of activity \nconcentrations in the environmental media from activity concentrations in the biota, by \ndividing the latter by the corresponding CR. For the aquatic environment, distribution \ncoefficients are used to derive activity concentrations in sediment from water concentrations \nand vice versa. The distribution coefficients are defined as the quotient of the activity \nconcentration per unit mass of sediment to the activity concentration per unit mass (or \nvolume) of (normally filtered) water. The default values of distribution coefficients included \nin the database have been primarily drawn from IAEA reviews on this subject (IAEA, 2001; \nIAEA, 2004). There is a set of rules that have been devised in order to fill the data matrix, \nrequired for the calculations at Tiers 2 and 3 and defining activity concentrations in selected \nreference organisms and media, from the available information entered by the user. This is \nconsidered in more detail (Section 3.2) below. \n \nThe derivation of each default transfer parameter included within the ERICA Tool is \ndescribed by Beresford et al (this issue) and Hosseini et al (this issue) for terrestrial and \naquatic ecosystems respectively. These data include not only information on expected values \nor weighted means but also on statistical parameters including the number of samples on \nwhich the values are based, the standard deviation and the underlying probability distribution \nfunction (PDF). \n \n Media activity concentrations can also be estimated from discharge data using generic \n\u2015transport\u2016 models based upon IAEA SRS-19 (IAEA, 2001). These are for use only in Tiers 1 \nand 2 (see below) as they are primarily screening models designed to estimate levels of \nradionuclides in atmospheric and in aquatic systems whilst minimising the possibility that the \ncalculated results would underestimate real doses (to a human critical group) by more than a \nfactor of 10. The dispersion models are appropriate to estimate average concentrations in \nwater or air from a single source continuous release assuming that an equilibrium or quasi-\nequilibrium has been established with respect to the released radionuclides and the relevant \ncomponents of the environment. As with any model, the results have an associated uncertainty \nwhich is described in more detail within IAEA SRS-19 (IAEA, 2001) and the Help of the \nERICA Tool. The following transport models are available within the Tool: Small lake (<400 \nkm\n2\n); Large lake (>=400 km\n2\n); Estuarine; River; Coastal and Air. The implementation of \nthese generic models within the tool has been tested rigorously via comparison with the \nexample calculations provided within the original IAEA publication and comparison with \nother codes implementing the SRS-19 models. \n \n2.2 Dose-rate calculations \nOnce activity concentrations in media and biota have been derived, the basic underlying \nequations (Equations 4 and 5) utilise these data in order to derive internal (Dint) and external \n(Dext) absorbed dose-rates (in units of Gy h\n-1\n), the total absorbed dose-rate being the sum of \nthese components, through the application of dose conversion coefficients (DCCs). \n \ni\nb\niint,\nb\ni\nb\nint DCC*CD\n\uf026  (4) \nwhere: \nb\niC  is the average concentration of radionuclide i in the reference organism b (Bq kg\n-1\n fresh weight), \nb\niint,DCC  is the radionuclide-specific dose conversion coefficient (DCC) for internal exposure defined as the \nratio between the average activity concentration of radionuclide i in the organism j and the dose rate to the \norganism b (\u00b5Gy h\n-1 \nper Bq kg\n-1\n fresh weight). \n \nz i\nb\nzi,ext\nref\nziz\nb\next DCC*CvD\n\uf026  (5) \nwhere: \nvz is the occupancy factor, i.e. fraction of the time that the organism b spends at a specified position z in its \nhabitat.  \nCzi\nref \nis the average concentration of radionuclide i in the reference media of a given location z (Bq kg\n-1\n fresh \nweight (soil or sediment) or Bq l\n-1\n (water)), \nDCC \nj\next,zi is the dose conversion coefficient for external exposure defined as the ratio between  the average \nactivity concentration of radionuclide i in the reference media corresponding to the location z and the dose rate to \norganism b (\u00b5Gy h\n-1\n per Bq kg\n-1\n fresh weight or Bq l\n-1\n). \n \nWeighted total dose rates (in \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n) are estimated by the Tool through the application of \nweighting factors (dimensionless) for alpha, low beta and high beta-gamma radiation \n(Equations 6 and 7). \n int,int,lowint,lowint DCCwfDCCwfDCCwfDCC  (6) \n,extlow,extlowext DCCwfDCCwfDCC  (7) \nwhere: \nwf = weighting factors for various components of radiation (low \u03b2, \u03b2 + \u03b3 and \u03b1) \nDCC = dose conversion coefficients in \u00b5Gyh\n-1\n per Bq l\n-1\n or Bq kg\n-1 \n \nDefault radiation weighting factors of 10 for alpha radiation, 3 for low energy beta and 1 for \n(high energy) beta and gamma radiation are applied in the Tool in line with the provisional, \nillustrative values, used in the FASSET framework (Pr\u00f6hl et al., 2003). This is also consistent \nwith the upper bound on the range of variation reported by Chambers et al. (2006) for -\nradiation weighting factors in relation to population relevant deterministic endpoints (mainly \nmortality). At Tiers 2 and 3, the radiation-weighting factors can be altered if the user wishes \nto use alternative values. If unweighted absorbed dose-rates are required the assessor can \nsimply set the weighting factors to unity. \nThe dosimetric calculation underpinning the derivation of DCCs is dealt with in detail \nelsewhere (Ulanovsky and Pr\u00f6hl, 2006; Ulavnovsky et al., this issue) Although methods (for \naquatic and terrestrial systems) have been applied to derive DCCs for the suite of reference \norganisms and radionuclides specified in Tables 1 and 2 respectively, the calculation can be \nperformed for other user-defined organisms within certain limits (the limitations on the \nmethod are elucidated in the Tool Help) and most radionuclides included in ICRP Publication \n38 (ICRP, 1983). This forms the basis for the \u2015Add organism\u2016 and \u2015Add isotope\u2016 functions \nthat are available at Tiers 2 and 3 within the Tool.  \nRadioactive daughter nuclides are included in the calculation of the DCCs if their half-lives \nare shorter than 10 days. Furthermore, DCCs for internal exposure were derived assuming a \nhomogeneous distribution of the radionuclide in the organism. The implications of this latter \nassumption in relation to the level of uncertainty introduced are explored by Zinger (2007) \nand are also addressed in the Tool help. \nAs for the case of the transfer data, the underlying DCC data, categorised in terms of  \nradionuclide and reference organism and split into components of internal and external \nirradiation and the radiation types alpha, (< 10 keV) low beta and high beta-gamma \nradiations, can be accessed in the underlying databases for the Tool within the \u2015Dosimetry\u2016 \ndatabase.  \n \n3. Overview of the tiered approach for the assessments \n \nKey differences between the tiers in terms of underlying calculations, data requirements and \nthe provision of concomitant contextual information are highlighted below; an overview of \nthe three ERICA tiers is provided in Table 3 and a flow diagram illustrating how the tiers are \nstructured within the tool are presented in Figure 1. \n \n3.1 Tier 1 \n \nAt Tier 1, the Tool uses Environmental Media Concentration Limits (EMCLs), defined as the \nactivity concentration in the selected media (soil or air (H, C, S and P only) in terrestrial \nenvironments, water or sediment in aquatic environments) that would result in a dose-rate to \nthe most exposed reference organism equal to that of the selected screening dose-rate (see \nbelow). The first stage in the EMCL derivation involves the calculation of intermediate-\nEMCL values calculated for all reference organisms for a selected radionuclide and media \n(Equation 8). The minimum intermediate-EMCL value across all organisms is then selected to \ndefine the unique EMCL value for a particular radionuclide. In other words, there is only one \nEMCL value per radionuclide and the limiting organism may be different for different \nradionuclides. Examples can be given for the terrestrial environment for which the limiting \norganisms for \n137\nCs, \n239\nPu and \n210\nPo are mammal (deer), gastropod and lichen-bryophyte \nrespectively. As a consequence the user cannot select reference organisms at Tier 1.  \n \nF\nSDR\nEMCL  (8) \n \nWhere: \n \nF = the maximum dose rate that an organism will receive for a unit activity concentration of a given radionuclide \nin an environmental medium (\u00b5Gy h\n-1\n per Bq l\n-1\n or per Bq kg\n-1\n (dry weight) or per Bq m\n-3\n (air) of medium). \nSDR = the screening dose rate (\u00b5Gy h\n-1\n) selected by the assessor at the assessment context stage. \n \nIn deriving F, the selection of the default location within the habitat is based on the \nconfiguration that will result in maximum exposure of the reference organism. For example, \nfor the terrestrial soil invertebrate, the assumption is made that the organism spends 100% of \nits time underground (when in reality it may also spend some of its time at the soil surface). \nAs an example of the equations used to estimate F, the case for a soil invertebrate is provided \nin Equation 9, below.  \nsi,extsisiint, DCCCRDCCF  (9) \nWhere : \nDCCint,si = internal dose conversion coefficient for soil invertebrate \nCRsi = concentration ratio for soil invertebrate \nDCCext,si = external DCC for in-soil configuration, i.e. volumetric source for soil invertebrate. \nThe full set of equations, covering all ecosystems and reference organisms, is provided in the \nHelp function for the Tool.  \n \nF values are calculated using all available information, which includes probability density \nfunctions of parameters for which these are available (namely CR values and distribution \ncoefficients). Calculations are thus performed probabilistically using a Monte Carlo approach, \noutside of the tool, resulting in a PDF for the F value from which any percentile of the F value \ncan be selected. As the default, the 95\nth\n percentile F value has been selected for use in the \ncalculations (i.e. this value is entered into Equation 8) to yield a 5\nth\n percentile EMCL. An \nillustrative example of this type of probabilistic derivation is presented in Figure 2. \n \nThe Tool uses a default screening dose rate (at Tiers 1 and 2), applicable to incremental (i.e. \nabove background) exposures, of 10 \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n above background. The derivation of which is \ndescribed elsewhere Garnier-Laplace and Gilbin (2006) and Garnier-Laplace et al. (this \nedition). The Tool also allows other screening dose-rates to be used: \n \n 40 \u00b5Gy h-1 for terrestrial animals or 400 \u00b5Gy h-1 for terrestrial plants and all aquatic \nspecies. These numbers are derived from the IAEA (1992) and UNSCEAR (1996) \nreports and are really benchmarks below which populations are unlikely to be \nsignificantly harmed based on previous reviews of the scientific literature. These also \ncorrespond to the US DoE dose limit of 10 mGy d\n-1\n (\u2248 400 \u00b5Gy h-1) for native aquatic \nanimals and benchmarks of 400 and 40 \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n for terrestrial plants and terrestrial \nanimals, respectively (based on the intent of appropriate DoE orders as no statutory \ndose limits were in place as of 2006), and used in the US DoE\u2018s graded approach (US \nDoE, 2002). \n User defined value (i.e. the user can enter their own number applicable for all \norganisms into this option). The Tool deals with user defined values by scaling the \nresults of the risk quotients from the calculations made using the environmental media \nconcentration limits (EMCLs) derived from the default ERICA value of 10 \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n. \nFor example, if a screening dose rate of 20 \u00b5Gy h\n-1\n has been defined by the user, the \nTool simply divides the calculated risk quotients (see below) by a factor of 2. \n \nThe default EMCL values can be accessed in the underlying databases. They can be found in \nthe directory \u2015Risk Characterisation\u2016. The database includes the numerical value of the \nEMCL and the limiting organism upon which the value is based. \n \nAt Tier 1, the data entry required is in the form of maximum activity concentrations for each \nselected radionuclide in environmental media only. The format of the required information \nwill depend on the ecosystem studied: \n \n Terrestrial ecosystems: activity concentration in soil (Bq kg-1 dry weight) or for \nradioisotopes of C, S, P or H in air (Bq m\n-3\n); \n Aquatic ecosystems: activity concentrations in water (Bq l-1) or sediment (Bq kg-1 dry \nweight) or both. \n \nThe radionuclide activity concentrations in the soil, water or sediment entered either as site-\nspecific values or through the use of one of the in-built SRS-19 model are compared with the \ncorresponding EMCLs. This produces a risk quotient (RQ) for each specific radionuclide \nincluded in the assessment. A total (or sum of) risk quotient (RQ) is also estimated, defined \nby (Equation 10): \n \nn\nn\nn\n1 EMCL\nM\nRQ  (10) \n \nWhere: \nRQ = (Total) Risk quotient; \nMn = measured or predicted maximal activity concentration for radionuclide \u2015n\u2016 in the medium in Bq l\n-1\n for \nwater, Bq kg\n-1\n (dry weight) for soil or sediment or Bq m\n-3\n for air; \nEMCLn = Environmental Media Concentration Limit for radionuclide \u2015n\u2016 (same units as media) and defined in \nEqu. 8. \n \nFor aquatic ecosystems limiting RQs for different radionuclides may be for different media \n(i.e. water or sediment). In this case, RQs based on different media types are added together to \nproduce the total RQ. Moreover, when summing RQs across the radionuclides present in a \ngiven situation, the limiting reference organism may not be the same for each radionuclide. \nAlthough this approach might appear highly conservative, it has been selected because it is \nreasonably consistent with other assessment approaches currently available (e.g. USDoE, \n2002) and, through the provision of only a single EMCL value for each radionuclide, \nmaintains the intended simple nature of Tier 1. \n \nIf the sum of the risk quotients is <1, then the user can be assured that there is a very low \nprobability that the assessment dose rate to any organism exceeds the incremental screening \ndose rate and therefore the risk to non-human biota can be considered negligible. If the RQ is \nequal to or exceeds 1, a more in depth study (progressing to Tier 2 or 3) would normally be \nrequired and the Tool indicates this to the assessor. \n \n \n \n3.2 Tier 2 \n \nAt Tier 2 the estimated total (internal and external summed) weighted absorbed dose rates for \neach reference organism included in the assessment are compared directly with the dose rate \nscreening value that was selected by the assessor for use in the assessment. This produces a \nrisk quotient for each organism included in the assessment (Equation 11): \n \nSDR\nDR\nRQ\norg\norg  (11) \n \nWhere:  \nRQn = Risk quotient for reference organism \u2015org\u2016; \nDRn = estimated total dose rate (\u00b5Gy h\n-1) for reference organism \u2015org\u2016; \nSDR = the screening dose rate (\u00b5Gy h\n-1\n) selected by the assessor at the assessment context stage. \n \nIn this tier greater flexibility is introduced as many of the parameters involved in the \ncalculations (as defined by Equations 1-5) can be reviewed and edited. These parameters \ninclude: \n \n Distribution coefficients \u2013 Kds (marine and freshwater); \n CRs, in this case, the methods used to derive the ERICA default values in the absence \nof empirical data are identified on the appropriate screen; \n Percentage dry weight soil or sediment; \n Occupancy factors; \n Radiation weighting factors. \n \nUser-specified geometries, can be added by using the Add organism functionality and if a \nradioisotope of interest is not represented in the ERICA default database, new radionuclides \ncan be added by accessing the Add isotope wizard. The assessor is required to enter additional \nparameters (CRs, Kds etc.) for new geometries and radionuclides.  \n \nTier 2 allows the user to enter one or more media or biota activity concentrations that have \nbeen collated for use in the assessment: \n \n For aquatic ecosystems: water activity concentrations (Bq l-1), sediment activity \nconcentrations (Bq kg\n-1\n, dry weight) and biota activity concentrations (Bq kg\n-1\n, fresh \nweight) can be entered. \n \n For terrestrial ecosystems: soil activity concentrations (Bq kg-1, dry weight); air \nactivity concentrations (Bq m\n-3\n) for the isotopes of C, S, P and H and biota activity \nconcentrations (Bq kg\n-1\n, fresh weight) can be entered. \n \nAt this tier it is recommended to enter expected (or \u2015best estimate\u2016) value activity \nconcentrations \u2013 concentrations that are representative of an area in time and space. This \ndiffers from Tier 1 where maximum activity concentrations are normally the most appropriate \ninput values. Depending upon the amount of data that you are able to enter the Tool follows a \nset of rules to calculate input values for all media and reference organisms with respect to a \nparticular radionuclide. There must be at least one activity concentration (i.e. for a media or \nany of the selected reference organisms) input for each radionuclide for the assessment to \ncontinue. The rules make use of the concentration ratios (CRs), and for aquatic ecosystems \nthe Kd values, entered earlier in the assessment process. Essentially, the rules provide details \non which data are used in extrapolating from one data type to another. For example, in the \naquatic environment when activity concentration data are available for water these data are \nused directly in preference to available sediment and biota concentrations in deriving \nunknown biota activity concentrations via appropriate CRs. This process is performed \nautomatically by the tool during the dose-rate calculations at Tiers 2 and 3 and the full set of \nrules are provided in the Tool Help. \n \n \nIn addition to \u2015expected values\u2016 of the RQs (based on expected values for the inputs and \nparameters), conservative estimates of RQs are also reported. These are obtained by \nmultiplying the expected RQs by Uncertainty Factors (UFs). The UF is an approximation \napplied to account for uncertainty in the dose-rate estimation and is defined as: the ratio \nbetween the 95\nth\n, 99\nth\n or any other percentile (above the expected value) and the expected \nvalue of the probability distribution of the dose rate (and RQ). To estimate the UF it was \nassumed that the dose rate and the RQ follow exponential distributions with means equal to \nthe estimated expected values. In this case, the UFs corresponding to the 95\nth\n and 99\nth\n \npercentiles are equal to 3 and 5 respectively. The assessor can also enter their own UF value. \nThe user-defined UF may be substantially lower than the default settings, for example, when \nmany site-specific data are available there may be some justification for refining the UF. \nHowever, such calculations require knowledge of the distribution of the RQ and the \npropagation of uncertainties in the dose calculations. \n \nUFs also maintain conservatism between Tiers 1 and 2. In the case where the same input \nvalues are entered and default settings are selected (i.e. for any single radionuclide and \ncorresponding limiting reference organism), the results for Tiers 1 and 2 (conservative \nestimates) should correspond approximately to one another because essentially the assessor \nhas not provided more detail and has not amended the problem formulation accordingly. The \nresults will not be identical for the same input values in both Tiers, however, because in Tier 1 \nthe EMCL is derived by extracting a 95\nth\n percentile derived from uncertainty propogation \nbased on \u2015real\u2016 PDFs (e.g. many CR values are characterised by log-normal distributions) \nwhereas at Tier 2, the 95\nth\n percentile (of the RQ) is derived from applying a UF to the \nexpected value. In other words, the underlying assumption at Tier 2 is that the PDF of the RQ \ncan be approximated using an exponential distribution whereas the PDF derived at Tier 1 (for \nthe EMCL and therefore the RQ) will reflect a combination of various distributions that may \nor may not be of exponential form.  \n \nUsing the exponential distribution in deriving the UF can be justified as it is the least biased \ndistribution that can be assumed if only the expected value of the distribution is available, as \nis the case at Tier 2. This is supported by the principle of maximum entropy (see Harr, 1987). \nAlthough experience shows that in reality most parameters are log-normally distributed, the \nuse of a lognormal distribution requires the standard deviation to be known as well. So for \nsimplicity, the assessor is not expected to enter such information at Tier 2 but may do so in \nTier 3 if there is a requirement to perform a more thorough evaluation of the data. It should \nalso be noted that when the standard deviation is numerically smaller than the mean, the 95\nth\n \nand other percentiles estimated using a lognormal distribution tend to be lower than the \ncorresponding values estimated from an equivalent exponential distribution using the same \nmean.  It can be concluded that the assumption of an exponential distribution provides \ncautious (or conservative) estimates of the percentiles as long as the coefficient of variation of \nthe estimates is less than 100 %.  \n \nThe calculated RQs used in combination with the other information provided within the Tier 2 \nassessment screens (as discussed below) enable the assessor to make a decision on whether \nthe assessment can be concluded or should continue. The assessor is helped by the Tool which \nuses various criteria and appropriate conditional recommendations are illustrated in Figure 3. \n \nIn those cases where is it recommended that \u2017the assessment is continued\u2018 or \u2017the assessment \nand results are reviewed\u2018 an automatic progression to a Tier 3 assessment is not always \nnecessary. For instance, it may be possible to refine the input data or Tool parameters (e.g. \nderive CR values applicable to the site or make measurements of radionuclide activity \nconcentrations in biota from the site) if justifiable and to then rerun the assessment at Tier 2. \nHowever, in this context the assessor should be aware that a recent comparison of site-specific \ndata to generic data (specifically, soil-plant concentration ratios), concluded that generic data \nmay often constitute the best choice, owing to the very large inherent variability in transfer \nparameters, which a few site-specific measurements may not encapsulate (Sheppard, 2005). \nAssessors should, therefore, consider carefully whether the quality of any available site-\nspecific data justifies its application. Site-specific data will always provide a useful \ncomparison with predictions generated using the Tool\u2018s generic parameters. \nIn instances where the conservative RQ is above 1 whilst the best estimate RQ is below 1, \ninterpretation of the results may lead to a decision that the assessment can be justifiable \nexited. In this respect, the Tool provides ancillary information to aid in the decision making \nprocess. To help the assessor put their results into context the results screen tabs labelled \n\u2015Background\u2016 and \u2015Effects\u2016 contain summarised information. \n \nThe background tab provides ranges in background exposure rates due to naturally occurring \nradionuclides (weighted using the ERICA default radiation weighting factors of 10 for alpha, \n3 for low energy beta and 1 for other beta and gammas). These data are derived from \npublished works (Brown et al., 2004; Beresford et al. 2007c). The ERICA Integrated \nApproach should be used to assess incremental doses from human activities only. If dose rates \nestimated within Tier 2 result in RQ values in excess of 1 but are insignificant in magnitude \nrelative to natural background exposure rates, the user might conclude that there is negligible \ncause for concern. This would be in line with the approach described by Pentreath, (2002), \nwhich is based on derived consideration levels. If activity concentrations of naturally \noccurring radionuclides are available for the assessment site the assessor could estimate site-\nspecific absorbed doses rates due to these for comparison to dose rates resulting from \nexposure to radionuclides from anthropogenic sources (but should not add them to the \nassessment). For sites being assessed for NORM contamination, the dose rates estimated will \ninclude a contribution from background levels of the radionuclides of interest. In this instance \nthe total dose rates should be compared to the summarised background dose rate provided \nwithin Tier 2 to determine if the incremental dose is likely to be of concern. \n \nThe effects tab contains a series of tables, one for each reference organism group for the \necosystem under assessment. The information is provided to allow a comparison between the \npredicted dose rates for the selected reference organisms to a summary of information about \nthe known biological effects of ionising radiation on non-human species collated within the \nFREDERICA database (Copplestone et al., this issue).The effects lookup tables are \nconstructed to provide a short statement on the types of biological effect that may be \noccurring at particular dose rates. The available information has been summarised to provide \nthe assessor with: \n Information on the dose rate at which the biological effect has been observed in an \nexperiment or field controlled study; \n The species on which the experiment was conducted; \n The endpoint (MB = morbidity, MT = mortality, RC = reproductive capacity, MUT = \nmutation); \n A brief statement on the type of biological effect observed. \n \nBased on expert judgement the effects were graded either no effect, minor, moderate, major or \nsevere. The biological effects information provided may support decision-making. The \nassessor can contextualise the predicted dose-rates in terms of expected radiation effects in \nparticular organism groups and for specific biological endpoints thus enabling a more \ninformed evaluation of the results of the Tier 2 assessment. \n \n3.3 Tier 3 \n \nTier 3 allows full probabilistic calculations to be performed through the application of Monte \nCarlo simulations. There is the same degree of flexibility at Tier 3 as that incorporated in Tier \n2 in the sense that the assessor may edit and review the various parameters used in the \nsubsequent calculations. In addition, input data, Kd values, CR values and radiation weighting \nfactors have an option allowing the user to assign a probability distribution function (PDF) to \nthem. This may be either as a default PDF (drawn from the underlying ERICA Tool database \ndescribed above) or as user defined ones. The following distribution types are supported by \nthe Tool: \n \n Exponential (required entry arithmetic mean, with optional lower cut off and upper cut \noff values) \n Normal (required entries arithmetic mean and standard deviation , with optional lower \ncut off and upper cut off values) \n Triangular (required entries minimum, maximum and mode values) \n Uniform (required entries minimum and maximum values) \n Lognormal (required entries arithmetic mean, and standard deviation,  with optional \nlower cut off and upper cut off values) \n Logtriangular (required entries  minimum, maximum and mode values) \n Loguniform (required entries minimum and maximum values) \n \nThe default PDFs included in the Tool database were defined using the following simple rule: \n \n Where a standard deviation could be determined from the data (normally the number \nof sample \u2015n\u2016 >1), a lognormal distribution was applied; \n For all other cases (where the value was derived or \u2015n\u2016 = 1) an exponential \ndistribution was applied. \n \nThis is based on the observations, as considered above, that the uncertainty for \nradioecological data, such as CRs and Kds, are often well fitted by lognormal distributions \nand that in cases where single, expected values are available the least biased distribution is an \nexponential one. \n \nTo estimate the uncertainty within the endpoints of an exposure assessment, the uncertainties \nin the inputs and parameters must be propagated though the model. When simple analytical \nexpressions for the probability distributions are available, variance propagation can be applied \nfor propagating the uncertainties (Morgan and Henrion, 1990, Hoffman and Hammonds, \n1994). When analytical methods cannot be applied, the uncertainties can be propagated using \nMonte Carlo analysis, this is the approach used in the tool. The basis of the Monte Carlo \nmethod are relatively straightforward (see Vose, 1996): point estimates in a model equation \nare replaced with probability distributions, samples are randomly taken from each \ndistribution, and the results tallied, usually in the form of a probability density function or \ncumulative distribution. The number of simulations used in the calculation can be selected by \nthe user. This process is illustrated in Figure 2. This method is particularly powerful in \naccounting for the variability associated with all inputs and parameters used in the \ncalculations. \n \nThe Tier 3 input screen, allows the user to enter the media or biota activity concentrations that \nhave been collated for use in the assessment. The same options as for Tier 2 are available, but \nnow single values or a probability distributions can be entered (a mixture of deterministic and \nprobabilistic data entries is also allowed). Furthermore, the same requirements for data entry \nas stipulated for Tier 2 are required, i.e. there must be at least one data entry per radionuclide, \nand the same rules are applied in filling the input data matrix. The parameters to be included \nin a probabilistic simulation can be selected and the number of simulations defined. \n \nThe results reported at Tier 3 provide no information on risk quotients because if the \nassessment has reached this stage of detailed analyses, screening dose-rates are no longer \nappropriate. The onus would now be on the assessor to derive their own benchmark(s) from \nwhich to make comparison with exposure derivations. The results tabs are therefore split into \ndeterministic data, where information relating to single entry values are reported (in tabulated \nfrom only), and probabilistic data, where information relating to probability distribution \nfunctions are reported (as figures with summary statistics).  \n \nThe supporting information available at Tier 3 for interpreting the dose rates predicted within \nan assessment are biological effects data collated from scientific literature within the \nFREDERICA database which describe the effects of exposure of ionising radiation on non-\nhuman species (Copplestone et al., this issue). The effects tab contains a direct link to the \nonline FREDERICA database which requires an internet connection. This direct link to \nFREDERICA ensures that the user will always access the most up to date version of the data \navailable within the FREDERICA database. \nThe search conducted is linked to the reference organism and the wildlife group that it \nbelongs to. By selecting the reference organism, the wildlife group will be automatically \nselected, the search conducted within the FREDERICA database will then identify all the \nendpoints (e.g. morbidity, mortality, reproductive capacity, mutation) contained within the \ndatabase. The predicted mean dose rate for a selected reference organism is used as the mid-\npoint of the dose rate range for the search within the FREDERICA database. The subsequent \nreport of the results from the FREDERICA database search contains the following \ninformation: \n The literature reference information from which the dose rate data has been taken; \n Details of the experiment that was conducted to obtain the dose rate effect data; \n Information on the dose rate at which the biological effect has been observed in an \nexperiment or field controlled study; \n The species on which the experiment was conducted; \n The endpoint (MB = morbidity, MT = mortality, RC = reproductive capacity, MUT = \nmutation); \n A brief statement on the type of biological effect observed. \nDifferent wildlife groups can be selected in the drop down list at the top of the tab screen and \nwill allow the assessor to access different sets of information. This information may help the \nassessor to identify areas for research and\/or targeted sampling and monitoring to look for \nknown biological effects that may be occurring based on the available data. The dose rate \nrange that is being searched can also be modified using two boxes (called lower and upper \nvalue) to the right of the organism drop down list. By default the lower value is always 0 and \nthe upper value is the 95\nth\n percentile dose rate predicted by the Tool for the selected organism. \nThis can be modified simply by typing a different value into either the lower or upper value \nbox and clicking the search button to re-submit the query to the database. \nFull details of the available information and how to use the FREDERICA database is \nprovided at the FREDERICA website (www.frederica-online.org), this includes a manual on \nthe searches available and describes the ways to export the data from the FREDERICA \ndatabase. \n \nThe Tier 3 results section also provides information in relation to sensitivity analysis. This \napportions the relative effect of the uncertain inputs and parameters on the variation and \nuncertainty of the simulation endpoints (dose rates and activity concentrations). Several \nsensitivity analysis methods of varying degrees of complexity have been proposed in the \nliterature (Sartelli et al. 2004). The models for calculation of dose rates implemented in the \nERICA tool are relatively simple and it is possible to perform sensitivity analyses using \nsimple correlation coefficients between the inputs\/parameters and the endpoints. In the \npresent version of the Tool (July 2007), two correlation coefficients are computed every time \na probabilistic simulation is carried out: the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the \nSpearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SCC). The PCC assumes linear relationship between \nvariables whereas the SRCC does not. \n In the simplest sense, the sensitivity analysis included in the Tool can be used to identify \nthose parameters that are having an overriding influence on the total dose-rate (or components \nof this dose-rate). If it is found that the parameter\/value under investigation is having a large \neffect on the output, it might be worth investigating\/examining this parameter in more detail. \nIf the parameter is a Kd or CR this might simply involve conducting more field or laboratory \nstudies to characterise the value more robustly. \n \n4. Concluding remarks \n \nThe assessment Tool has been successfully developed to automate the assessment component \nof the ERICA integrated approach. The software leads the user through the assessment \nprocess by means of step-wise \u2015wizards\u2016 and has been designed to allow a logical format for \ndocumenting the assessment procedure and great flexibility in relation to data entry and \nparameter selection especially as the assessment moves to higher tier, more complex, \nenvironmental risk calculations.  The development process has been undertaken in close \nconsultation with the group experts constituting ERICA\u2018s end-user group (e.g. Zinger, 2006; \nZinger et al., in this issue) and constitutes the culmination of 3 years of development activities \nby the consortium.  \n \nThe prototype Tool (as of December 2006) was tested through case studies at several \nterrestrial, freshwater and marine environments, and for a broad suite of anthropogenically \nderived and technologically enhanced radionuclides (Beresford et al., 2007b). Predictions of \nactivity concentrations in biota and media made by Tool were generally adequately in \nagreement with observed data. Where this was not the case reasonable arguments could be \npresented to explain discrepancies.  The case studies did not provide any definitive validation \nof the effects prediction provided by the Tool beyond the observation that, for one particular \ncase where a cursory comparison was practicable, the predictions made were not in \ncontradiction to the observed effects in the field. Many of the limitations relating to the \napplication of the tool, were often associated with a lack of clear explanation in supporting \nguidance, these were addressed before the final release of the software. Nonetheless, \nweaknesses do remain. Although intensive debugging of the software has been undertaken in \nthe period leading up to the release, occasional problems may still arise. Testing of some of \nthe parameters and assumptions used by the Tool, notably the distribution coefficients and the \nuncertainty factors applied at Tier 2, has not been undertaken in a rigorous fashion to date and \ncould be a focus for more comprehensive evaluation in the future. In addition to the case \nstudies many of the underlying parameters used in the calculations performed by the Tool \nincluding numerous (internal and external) DCCs and concentration ratios have been subject \nto intercomparison with approaches using similar parameters within an international forum \n(Beresford et al., in-press; Vives i Batlle, 2007). This has begun to provide some validation \nand aids quality assurance.  \n \nThe tool is currently (as of July 2007) freely available at the EC EURATOM Project \nPROTECT website - http:\/\/www.ceh.ac.uk\/protect\/. All new users have to register before \nreceiving a download. To use the Tool Java software needs to be installed, this is freely \navailable from http:\/\/www.java.com\/en\/download\/index.jsp.The Tool will be developed \nfurther in the coming years with a plan to release periodic updates when new data and \nfunctionality become available. This will occur under the auspices of core group, consisting of \nsome members from the original ERICA consortium. The development of the Tool will \nclearly benefit as it becomes used by the wider radiological protection community and the \ndevelopers receive feedback on limitations and requirements.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was supported by the EC-EURATOM 6\nth\n Framework Programme (2002-2006) and \nforms part of the ERICA (Environmental Risk from Ionising Contaminants: Assessment and \nManagement) project, contract FI6R-CT-2003-508847.
