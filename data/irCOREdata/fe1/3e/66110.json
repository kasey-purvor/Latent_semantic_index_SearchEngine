Crossovers are observed which\nallow scales associated with both stable and unstable quantum particles to be picked\nup. By introducing the concept of shielding, we show that these match precisely with\nthe mass scales found classically, supporting the idea that the full set of unstable\nparticle states persists even far from the semiclassical regime. General rules for\nthe effective TBA systems governing individual crossovers are given, and we also\ncomment on the Lagrangian treatment of the theories, novel issues which arise in the\nform-factor approach for theories with unstable particles, and the role of heterotic\ncosets in the staircase flows exhibited by the HSG models.\n1 Introduction\nThe homogeneous sine-Gordon (HSG) models [1] are two-dimensional quantum field\ntheories with a number of remarkable properties. They are integrable perturbations of\nlevel-k G-parafermions [2], that is of coset conformal field theories of the form Gk\/U(1)\nrg ,\nwhere G is a simple compact Lie group with Lie algebra g, k > 1 is an integer, and rg is\nthe rank of g . In the limit k \u2192 \u221e they can be analysed using semiclassical techniques,\nand the resulting data used to make conjectures for the mass spectra and exact S-matrices\nat arbitrary values of k [3]1. Checks of the S-matrices using both thermodynamic Bethe\nansatz (TBA) [5] and form-factor [6, 7, 8] approaches leave little doubt that they describe\nthe perturbed parafermionic theories correctly, even for small values of k far from the\nsemiclassical regime.\nAn interesting feature to emerge from the semiclassical studies was the presence of\nunstable particles [9]. If hg is the Coxeter number of g, a total of (k\u22121) rghg\/2 particle-like\nstates (in the simply-laced cases) were identified, k\u22121 for each positive root of g . Those\ncorresponding to the simple roots are stable; all the rest are semiclassically unstable.\nOn the other hand, in the S-matrix treatment of the full quantum theory, only stable\nparticles are seen directly. Evidence for the unstable particles must come by more indirect\nroutes, such as the appearance of resonance poles at complex rapidities in the scattering\namplitudes of pairs of stable asymptotic particle states. However, for the HSG models\nonly the rg\u22121 sets of unstable particles associated with the roots of height two can be\npicked up in this way2. And at small values of k, far from the semiclassical regime,\nthe resonance peaks for the height-two particles are very broad, and their interpretation\nbecomes delicate. This raises an immediate question \u2013 how should we verify the existence\nof the remaining particles in the quantum theory, and what influence do they have on the\nphysical properties of the models? Are the extra unstable particles even present in the\nmodels with k small, or do they merely emerge when the limit k \u2192\u221e is taken?\nIn this paper we shall address these and related issues by returning to the study of\nfinite-size effects using the TBA technique. At mass scales where new stable or unstable\nparticle states become important, we predict analytically (and confirm numerically) a\nchange in the behaviour of the finite-size scaling function, even for those unstable particles\nwhich are not seen directly in the two-particle S-matrices.\nThe influence of the extra unstable particles gives the HSG models a much richer\nstructure of renormalisation group flows than was initially thought, unifying and gener-\nalising the simplest flows between conformal field theories within a common structure.\nMoreover, as a result of parity breaking, some of these flows turn out to involve heterotic\ncoset models.\nOur main observations were first presented in [10, 11], and [11] can be consulted for\nfurther background material. The rest of the present paper is organised as follows. In\nsection 2 some key features of the HSG models and their resonances are recalled, and our\nstrategy for detecting the unstable resonances is described. This requires us to be able\nto separate the relevant mass scales suitably, and section 3 is devoted to an analysis of\nthis problem in the classical theory. The idea of \u2018shielding\u2019 is introduced, and it is shown\n1We restrict ourselves to simply-laced G in this paper, but we note that S-matrices for the non simply-\nlaced cases have also been proposed, in [4].\n2Recall that if \u03b2 =\n\u2211rg\n1 ci\u03b1i is a root of g, with {\u03b1i} \u2261 \u2206 a set of simple roots, then the height of \u03b2\nwith respect to \u2206 is ht(\u03b2) =\n\u2211rg\n1 ci .\n1\nhow certain mass scales one might na\u00a8\u0131vely expect to find in a classical HSG model may\nbe missing. Then in section 4 we show, through a detailed analysis of the TBA equations\nwhich we illustrate with a number of examples, that these classical effects are precisely\nmatched in the finite-size behaviour of the quantum theory. The maximal number of\nseparated steps that a general HSG model can exhibit, a question rendered non-trivial by\nshielding, is discussed in section 5. We then move on to other ways to understand the\ncrossovers, first discussing predictions from the Lagrangian approach in section 6 before\nmaking some comments on form factor calculations in section 7. Finally, section 8 contains\nour conclusions and there are two appendices.\n2 The HSG models and their resonances\nThroughout this paper, we shall be considering the HSG models corresponding to\nperturbations of the level-k parafermionic coset conformal field theories Gk\/U(1)\nrg , where\nG is a simple compact Lie group, with Lie algebra g of rank rg, Coxeter number hg, and\ndual Coxeter number h\u2228g . Since we will only discuss the cases where g is simply-laced,\nh\u2228g = hg, but we shall preserve the distinction in formulae of more general applicability.\nUnlike the cases first studied by Zamolodchikov [12] and others, the HSG models are\nmultiparameter deformations of conformal field theories3. The basic operators of the un-\nperturbed theory lie in multiplets \u03a6\u039b,\u039b\u03c9,\u03c9 labelled by two representations of G with highest\nweights (\u039b,\u039b), and two weights (\u03c9,\u03c9) in those representations [16], and the HSG perturb-\ning operators are certain spinless primary fields \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6adj, adj0, 0 , with conformal dimensions\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2206\u00af\u03a6 = h\n\u2228\ng \/(k + h\n\u2228\ng ). Since the multiplicity of the weight 0 in the adjoint represen-\ntation is rg , \u03a6\nadj, adj\n0, 0 is r\n2\ng -dimensional, and has a basis {\u03c6adj, adjp , q | p, q = 1 . . . rg}. The per-\nturbations within this multiplet which lead to HSG models are conveniently parametrised\nby a pair of rg-dimensional vectors \u03bb and \u03bb as\n\u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb =\nrg\u2211\np,q=1\n\u03bbp \u03bbq \u03c6\nadj, adj\np , q , (2.1)\nwhere \u03bb1 . . . \u03bbrg and \u03bb1 . . . \u03bbrg are the components of the vectors \u03bb and \u03bb . From this\nperspective the HSG actions have the form\nSHSG = SCFT + \u00b5\n\u222b\nd2x \u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb , (2.2)\nwhere SCFT denotes an action for the conformal field theory of level-k G-parafermions,\nand \u00b5 is a dimensionful coupling which can be related to the overall mass scale, once\nthe combined normalisation of \u03bb and \u03bb has been fixed by demanding the standard short-\ndistance behaviour of two-point functions involving \u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb . Note that \u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb is trivially\ninvariant under a joint rescaling\n\u03bb\u2192 \u03b1\u03bb , \u03bb\u2192 \u03b1\u22121\u03bb , (2.3)\n3Other possibilities for constructing multiparameter integrable perturbations of conformal field theo-\nries are discussed in, for example, [13, 14, 15].\n2\nwhich together with the normalisation condition leaves 2rg \u2212 2 dimensionless parameters\nin \u03bb and \u03bb. Thus the theory is determined by a total of 2rg \u2212 1 parameters, one of which\ncan be mapped onto the overall scale.\nA more explicit construction of the HSG actions (2.2) is provided by the identification\nof SCFT with the gauged Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZW) action associated with a\ncoset of the form G\/H at level k, where H \u2282 G is a maximal abelian torus (see [1, 2]\nand section 6 for details). Then, \u03c6adj, adjp , q are the Cartan matrix elements of the spinless\nprimary field corresponding to the WZW field in the adjoint representation [17]. One of\nthe nicest features of this formulation is that it simplifies the analysis of these models\nin the large-k limit, which corresponds to both the weak-coupling (perturbative) and\nsemiclassical regimes of the perturbed gauged WZW action.\nThe HSG models can also be characterised by their long-distance, infrared, behaviour.\nThe exact S-matrices proposed in [3] describe the scattering of a set of stable solitonic\nparticles labelled by two quantum numbers, (i, a), where i = 1 . . . rg labels a simple root\nof g, and a = 1 . . . k\u22121. The mass of the particle (i, a) is\nM ia = Mmi \u00b5a , (2.4)\nwhereM is a dimensionful overall mass scale, m1, . . . , mrg are rg arbitrary (non-vanishing)\nrelative masses, one for each simple root of g, and the numbers \u00b5a = sin(\u03c0a\/k)\/ sin(\u03c0\/k)\nare the components of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the ak\u22121 Cartan matrix. The\nS-matrix elements of these particles depend on a further rg\u22121 real \u2018resonance parameters\u2019\n\u03c3ij = \u2212\u03c3ji, defined for each pair {i, j} of neighbouring nodes on the Dynkin diagram of\ng. The resonance parameters are most conveniently specified by assigning a variable \u03c3i\nto each node of g and setting \u03c3ij = \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j . The resulting set of infrared parameters M ,\n{mi}, and {\u03c3i} is redundant, but the obvious symmetries M \u2192 \u03b1M , {mi} \u2192 {\u03b1\u22121mi},\nand {\u03c3i} \u2192 {\u03c3i + \u03b2}, ensure that there are only 2rg \u2212 1 independent parameters, just as\nfor the ultraviolet description of the models.\nClassically, the theory exhibits further solitonic particle-like solutions associated with\nall of the other positive roots \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+g [9]. Their masses can be specified in a concise way\nvia\n\u03bb\u00b1 =\nrg\u2211\n1\nmi e\n\u00b1\u03c3i \u03bbi (2.5)\nwhere the \u03bbi , i = 1 . . . rg , are the fundamental weights of g and satisfy \u03bbi \u00b7\u03b1j = \u03b4ij . The\nrelative mass scale for the solitonic particles associated with the positive root \u03b2 is then\nm2\u03b2 = (\u03bb+ \u00b7 \u03b2) (\u03bb\u2212 \u00b7 \u03b2) , (2.6)\nwhich reduces to m2i for \u03b2 = \u03b1i. The semiclassical analysis performed using the gauged\nWZW formulation in [3] shows that the classical particles associated with non-simple roots\ndecay, and so do not appear directly in the spectrum of asymptotic quantum states4. In\nparticular, if \u03b1i + \u03b1j is a root of g or, equivalently, {i, j} is a pair of neighbouring\nnodes on the Dynkin diagram of g, the relative mass scale and decay width of the soliton\nparticles associated with that root are m2\u03b1i+\u03b1j = m\n2\ni + m\n2\nj + 2mimj cosh(\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j) and\n\u0393\u03b1i,\u03b1j =\npi\nk\n2mimj\nm\u03b1i+\u03b1j\nsinh |\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j |.\n4As recalled in section 6 below, this formulation also shows that \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 correspond in the semi-\nclassical limit to the two vectors \u03bb and \u03bb specifying the action (2.2).\n3\nIn the full quantum theory, such long-lived unstable particles should correspond to\nresonances in interactions among the stable particles [18]. For example, if two stable\nparticles scatter at a center-of-mass energy\n\u221a\ns close to the mass of an unstable state\nwith appropriate quantum numbers, then they can form that state and remain in it\nfor a time roughly equal to its lifetime, before decaying. Consequently, the transition\namplitude shows a bump at the appropriate energy, which normally corresponds to a\ncomplex simple pole in the S-matrix amplitude. This pole is located on the second\nRiemann sheet of the complex (Mandelstam) s-plane, and its position can be conveniently\nwritten as sR = (MR\u2212i\u0393R\/2)2. In this way, \u03c4 = ~\/\u0393R measures the lifetime of the unstable\nparticle, and the form of the resonance pole is given by the Breit-Wigner formula\nS \u2248 1\u2212 i 2MR\u0393R\n(s\u2212 sR) , sR \u2261 (MR \u2212 i\u0393R\/2)\n2 . (2.7)\nNotice that the bump in the scattering probability |1 \u2212 S|2 occurs around s = Re(sR),\njustifying the usual identification of M\u03c1 \u2261\n\u221a\nRe(sR) with the physical mass of the unsta-\nble particle (see for example the discussions in [19], especially [20]). Another definition\nsometimes used for this mass is MR = Re(\n\u221a\nsR). If the lifetime is large, which translates\ninto the condition5 \u0393R \u226a MR and corresponds to the situation when the pole is close to\nthe real (physical) axis of the complex s-plane, then MR \u2243 M\u03c1. Otherwise, when \u0393R is\nlarger, the lifetime is short and the unstable particle does not have a definite physical\nmass, as a consequence of the uncertainty principle. This has made the proper definition\nof the masses of unstable particles a subject of debate, which becomes of phenomenolog-\nical relevance when the experimental data is accurate enough, as is exemplified by the\ncases of the Z0 boson [21] or the baryon resonances [22] (see also [23]). In particular,\nthere is no general consensus as to how to choose between M\u03c1 and MR to characterise the\nmass of the unstable state, even though they differ significantly when \u0393R\/MR is large.\nIn the HSG models this question can be studied in a context where the S-matrix and\nrelated observables are known exactly. Even though it was the correspondence between\nunstable particles and resonance poles in the semiclassical limit that provided the starting-\npoint for the S-matrix elements conjectured in [3], the fact that they are thought to be\nexact even away from this limit allows non-trivial predictions to be made and tested.\nFor the scattering between particles (i, 1) and (j, 1), with i and j neighbouring nodes\non the Dynkin diagram of g and with (i, 1) initially to the left of (j, 1), the relevant\namplitude Si1\nj\n1(\u03b8) has a resonance pole at the complex rapidity value \u03b8Rij = \u03c3ji \u2212 i\u03c0\/k.\nThis corresponds to a pole on the second sheet of the complex s-plane at s = sRij , where\nsRij = M\n2(m2i +m\n2\nj + 2mimj cosh \u03b8Rij ) . (2.8)\nThis pole can only be associated with a physical unstable particle if Im(sRij ) < 0 [18],\nwhich requires \u03c3ji > 0. (If \u03c3ji < 0, the pole is a \u2018shadow pole\u2019 whose existence is required\nby the Hermitian anlyticity condition satisfied by the S-matrix amplitudes [3].) In the\nsemiclassical limit, k is large and the parameters \u0393Rij and MRij corresponding to sRij\nsatisfy the bound \u0393Rij\/MRij < \u03c0\/k . The consequent smallness of this ratio means that\nthe pole at sRij can be immediately interpreted as a trace of a long-lived unstable particle\n5For real physical unstable particles, the ratio \u0393R\/MR runs from \u223c 10\u22122\u201310\u22121 for hadron resonances\nand the Z0 andW\u00b1 bosons, to much smaller values for other electroweakly decaying particles, like \u223c 10\u22127\nor \u223c 10\u221215 for the pions pi0 and pi\u00b1, respectively [19].\n4\nassociated with the height-two root \u03b1i+\u03b1j. In this regime the mass scale of the unstable\nparticle is unambiguously defined by M\u03c1ij \u2243 MRij \u2243 Mm\u03b1i+\u03b1j , where m\u03b1i+\u03b1j is given\nby (2.6).\nFor small k, beyond the semiclassical limit, the interpretation of this pole is not so\nclear. It is so far from the physical real axis that the approximation provided by the\nBreit-Wigner formula is less useful, as illustrated by figure 1. This is particularly clear\nfor k = 2, when the pole is located at sRij = M\n2(m2i +m\n2\nj \u2212 imimje \u03c3ji). Then, for large\nenough values of the resonance parameter, namely \u03c3ji \u226b ln (m2i +m2j )\/mimj , the ratio\n\u0393Rij\/MRij \u2248 2 and, not surprisingly, the two standard ways to characterise the mass scale\nof the would-be unstable state lead to very different values:\nM\u03c1ij = M\n\u221a\nm2i +m\n2\nj and MRij \u2248M\n\u221a\nmimj\n2\ne \u03c3ji\/2 . (2.9)\nLetting \u03c3ji tend to infinity, these two scales can be made arbitrarily far apart.\n(b)\nmi+mj\nk=2\nk=3\nk=50\nm\u03b1i+\u03b1j\n(mi+mj)2(mi-mj)2\nk=4\nk\u2192\u221e\r\n(a)\nk=2\nk=3\nm\u03b1i+\u03b1j\n2\nFigure 1: (a) The resonance pole of Si1\nj\n1 in the second Riemann sheet of the complex s-plane\nfor various values of k.

The more general amplitudes Sia\nj\nb(\u03b8) have a plethora of resonance\npoles for generic values of k \u2013 either min(a, b) or k\u2212max(a, b) , depending on whether\na+b \u2264 k or a+b \u2265 k \u2013 and the classification of the resonances in multiparticle scattering,\nnecessary to see the unstable particles of height greater than 2, becomes more and more\ninvolved as the number of particles increases.\nFortunately, there are other physical observables, such as correlation functions and\nfinite-size effects, where all types of particles play similar roles, setting the scales of\ncrossover phenomena. This is because the effective behaviour of the system at a given\nscale depends on the number of particle states which are effectively light at that scale,\nirrespective of their stability. Examining the system at different scales thus provides\na well-defined method to detect the existence of physical mass scales associated with\nboth stable and unstable particles. There is just one limitation: the nature of crossover\nphenomena means that their study cannot provide the values of mass scales with arbitrary\n5\nprecision. In fact, this is not surprising: while the masses of the stable particles can\nalternatively be extracted, with in principle arbitrary accuracy, from the far-infrared\nasymptotics of correlation functions and finite-size data, no such option can exist for the\nunstable particles, given the uncertainty principle.\nIn the next sections we shall study the finite-size behaviour of generic HSG models\nusing the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, or TBA. Mass scales can only be picked up\napproximately, and some may be impossible to split apart, but within these limitations\nwe find complete agreement with the idea that there is a scale in the quantum theory\nassociated with each positive root of g, given by eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) as a function of the\nS-matrix parameters {mi, \u03c3i}. This is consistent with the idea that all of the semiclassical\nsoliton particles survive in the quantum theory as stable or unstable particles, for any value\nof k. Moreover, taking (2.9) into account, our results indicate that, at least for k = 2,\nthe commonly-used formula M\u03c1 =\n\u221a\nRe(sR) fails to characterise the mass scales of the\nunstable particles, and favour the use of MR instead.\n3 Separating the classical mass scales\nThe classical theories depend on 2rg\u22121 independent parameters, but have a set of\nsolitonic particle states for each of the rg hg\/2 positive roots. For generic values of the\nparameters, the masses assigned to these roots by the formula (2.6) will all be different,\nand if mass scales could be discerned with arbitrary precision, one might hope to dis-\ntinguish rg hg\/2 different values. However, this is too much to expect in the quantum\ntheory: as just discussed, unstable particles only show up in resonance poles or crossover\nphenomena, and these do not yield sharply-defined mass scales. The most that can be\nasked is to pick up well-separated scales, and this raises the question of how many of\nthese can be manufactured by varying the 2rg\u22121 parameters at our disposal. Even at the\nclassical level this is a non-trivial problem, the investigation of which forms the topic of\nthe present section. With this out of the way we shall return to the quantum theory in\nsection 4.\nBefore we begin, we should explain what we mean by \u2018well-separated\u2019. The theory has\n2rg \u2212 1 parameters; for two scales to be well-separated, we mean that their ratio can be\nmade arbitrarily large by varying those parameters, while leaving the overall ordering of\nall scales in the model unchanged. There may of course be many ways to do this, but\none general prescription will be given in eq. (4.37) below. At some stages we shall also\nconsider the logarithms of well-separated quantities, whose differences can be made large;\nto distinguish between the two concepts, we set up the following notation:\na \u226b b \u21d4 a\u2212 b > \u03ba (3.1)\nA \u226b B \u21d4 A\/B > K (3.2)\nwhere the constants \u03ba and K can be made arbitrarily large by varying the available\nparameters, uniformly for all quantities under discussion. In particular, a\u226b b\u21d4 ea \u226b eb.\nThe classical discussion starts with the mass formula (2.6), which we repeat here:\nm2\u03b2 = (\u03bb+ \u00b7 \u03b2) (\u03bb\u2212 \u00b7 \u03b2) , (3.3)\nwhere\n\u03bb\u00b1 =\nrg\u2211\ni=1\nmi e\n\u00b1\u03c3i \u03bbi , \u03bbi \u00b7\u03b1j = \u03b4ij . (3.4)\n6\nOur task is to characterise, for given values of the parameters mi and \u03c3j , how many\nseparated scales appear in the set of numbers {m2\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+g } .\nExpanding \u03b2 in the basis of simple roots {\u03b1i},\n\u03b2 =\nrg\u2211\ni=1\nci(\u03b2)\u03b1i (3.5)\nwhere the non-negative integers ci(\u03b2) = \u03bbi \u00b7 \u03b2 are all of order one (the largest possible\nvalue, found for the highest root of the e8 theories, is 6). Substituting into (3.3),\nm2\u03b2 =\nrg\u2211\ni,j=1\nci(\u03b2)cj(\u03b2)mimj e\n\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j , (3.6)\nand thus all squared masses are linear combinations of the rg(rg+1)\/2 quantities\nmimj cosh(\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j) , i, j = 1 . . . rg , (3.7)\nwith coefficients 2ci(\u03b2)cj(\u03b2) that are fixed, and so independent of the parameters {mi, \u03c3j},\nand are the squares of numbers of order one. Therefore, we can be sure that the model\nhas no more than rg(rg+1)\/2 separable scales, given by the numbers\nmij =\n\u221a\nmimj e\n|\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j |\/2 , i, j = 1 . . . rg . (3.8)\nOnly in the an theories, for which hg = n+1 = rg+1, is rg(rg+1)\/2 equal to the number\nof positive roots \u2013 in all other cases it is smaller. An immediate consequence is that\nthe maximal number of separated mass scales that a classical HSG model can exhibit is\ngenerally less than the number of positive roots. However, two more issues remain. First,\nwe should check that the mij really can be separated. Second, since these scales only ever\nappear in the linear combinations (3.6), for a given configuration of the parameters, it\ncould be that some numbers from the set (3.7) never occur as the largest term in these\nsums, but rather are always swamped, or shielded, by other terms. This would mean\nthat the number of scales actually present was less than a naive analysis of (3.8) would\nsuggest.\nThe first issue is easily resolved by means of a specific example. Take the particular\nchoice mj = e\nja and \u03c3j = jb, for two real numbers a, b\u226b 0. Then\nmimj cosh(\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j) \u2248 12 e (i+j) a e |i\u2212j| b . (3.9)\nFor generic a and b with a\/b irrational this provides rg(rg + 1)\/2 different scales, which\ncan be made of arbitrarily different magnitude by choosing a and b large enough.\nThe second question is more subtle, and requires some more detailed properties of\nroot systems. Consider a particular number from the set (3.7), say mkml cosh(\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l) . If\nk = l then this can always be realised as the squared mass of a classical particle simply by\ntaking \u03b2 = \u03b1k in (3.6), and so we can take k 6= l. For mkml cosh(\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l) to appear in the\nsum (3.6) for a specific root \u03b2, it must be true that ck(\u03b2) 6= 0 and cl(\u03b2) 6= 0 . Now for any\nroot \u03b2, the set of simple roots \u03b1i such that ci(\u03b2) 6= 0 is connected on the Dynkin diagram\nof g.6 Hence, there is a chain of nodes {i1 . . . in} , on the Dynkin diagram of g with\n6Suppose there are s connected components to the set of \u03b1i with ci(\u03b2) nonzero. Let \u03b2t be the sum of\nthe ci(\u03b2)\u03b1i with \u03b1i restricted to the t\nth component, so that \u03b2 =\n\u2211\ns\nt=1 \u03b2t . Since each \u03b2t lies on the root\nlattice, |\u03b2t|2 \u2265 2 ; and since the \u03b2t are sums of roots on mutually disconnected portions of the Dynkin\ndiagram, \u03b2t \u00b7 \u03b2t\u2032 = 0 for t 6= t\u2032. Thus |\u03b2|2 =\n\u2211\ns\nt=1 |\u03b2t|2 \u2265 2s . But \u03b2 is a root, so |\u03b2|2 = 2 and hence\ns = 1, as claimed.\n7\n\u03b1i1 = \u03b1k , \u03b1in = \u03b1l , cip(\u03b2) 6= 0 for p = 1 . . . n , and with {ip , ip+1} neighbouring nodes\non the Dynkin diagram for p = 1 . . . n\u22121. This means that whenever mkml cosh(\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l)\nappears in one of the sums (3.6), it is inevitably accompanied by the terms\nmipmiq cosh(\u03c3ip\u2212\u03c3iq) , p, q = 1 . . . n , (3.10)\nand mkml cosh(\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l) must be larger than all of these numbers if it is not to be swamped.\nTaking square roots, the condition for the scale mkl not to be hidden by the other scales\nthat always appear with it is that\nmkl \u226b mipiq \u2200 p, q \u2208 {1 . . . n} with {p, q} 6= {1, n} , (3.11)\nwhere the roots {\u03b1i1 . . .\u03b1in} form the unique chain of simple roots on the Dynkin diagram\nof g joining \u03b1k to \u03b1l. (The chain is unique since non-affine Dynkin diagrams are trees.)\nConversely, suppose that (3.11) is satisfied for (k, l). Then, with {\u03b1i1 . . .\u03b1in} again the\nchain of roots joining \u03b1k to \u03b1l, \u03b2 = \u03b1i1+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+\u03b1in is a root of g, and mkml cosh(\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l) is\nrealised as the squared mass scale for the classical particles associated with \u03b2 \u2013 by (3.11),\nit dominates all other terms in the expression (3.6) for m2\u03b2. Thus, (3.11) gives a necessary\nand sufficient condition for mkl to be realised as the mass scale of a set of classical particle\nstates in the model.\nThere is a simple graphical method to check all of the conditions (3.11) at once. Start\nby drawing a series of horizontal lines, or \u2018telegraph wires\u2019, one for each root in the chain\n{\u03b1i1 . . .\u03b1in}. Give each wire a coordinate x running from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e, and for each\np = 1 . . . n, paint those parts of the pth wire with |x| > ln(mkl) \u2212 ln(mip) a different\ncolour, red say.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that \u03c3k \u2265 \u03c3l ; otherwise relabel the chain so that\ni1 = l and in = k. Now draw a zig-zag line between the wires, starting at the point\nx1 = \u2212 ln(mkl)+ ln(mi1) on the first wire (p = 1, i1 = k) and then moving horizontally by\nan amount \u03c3ip\u2212\u03c3ip+1 going from the pth to the (p+1)th wire. This way, the pth segment of\nthe line joins the point xp = x1\u2212\u03c3ip+\u03c3i1 on the pth wire to the point xp+1 = x1\u2212\u03c3ip+1+\u03c3i1\non the (p+1)th wire. By the time the last wire has been reached, the total horizontal shift\nis \u03c3i1\u2212\u03c3in = \u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l, and the zig-zag terminates at xn = x1\u2212\u03c3l+\u03c3k = + ln(mkl)\u2212ln(min),\non the nth wire.\nThen condition (3.11) is equivalent to the following demand:\nApart from at its beginning and end, the zig-zag remains far\nfrom all red-painted regions of wire.\n(3.12)\nThis can be proved as follows.\nMoving from wire p to wire q, the total horizontal shift of the zig-zag is \u03c3 = \u03c3ip \u2212\u03c3iq .\nFor this to fit between the red-painted regions of wires p and q, the absolute value of\n\u03c3 must be less than the horizontal separation of these two regions, which is 2 ln(mkl) \u2212\nln(mip)\u2212 ln(miq). Hence\n|\u03c3ip \u2212 \u03c3iq | \u226a 2 ln(mkl)\u2212 ln(mip)\u2212 ln(miq) (3.13)\nand so, recalling (3.8),\n2 ln(mipiq)\u226a 2 ln(mkl) (3.14)\n8\nan\nt t t t tp p p p p p p p p\n1 2 3 n\u20131 n\ndn\nt t t t tp p p p p p p p p\n1 2 3 n\u20132\ns n\nn\u20131\nen\nt t t t tp p p p p p p p p\ns\n1 2 n\u20133 n\u20132 n\u20131\nn\nFigure 2: Dynkin diagrams of the simply-laced Lie algebras. The numbers show our labelling\nconvention for the nodes.\nFor the zig-zag to remain far from all red-painted regions, this condition must be met for\nall 1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 n with {p, q} 6= {1, n}. (Note we include the cases p = q, for which (3.13)\nreduces to the requirement that there be a non-zero gap between the red-painted regions\nof the pth wire.) Dividing (3.14) by 2 and exponentiating, (3.11) is recovered.\nTo see the condition in action, consider the d4, or SO(8), case. The Lie algebra d4 has\n4 simple roots, \u03b11 . . .\u03b14, and 12 positive roots; we label the simple roots as in figure 2.\nFor this example we shall take the masses of the four stable particles equal, and set the\nparameters \u03c3i as follows:\nm1 = m2 = m3 = m4 = m ;\n\u03c31 = 100 , \u03c32 = 80 , \u03c33 = 45 , \u03c34 = 0 . (3.15)\nThese correspond to the following values of the three original S-matrix resonance param-\neters: \u03c312 = 20, \u03c323 = 35 and \u03c324 = 80 .\nGrouping the roots together according to their heights, the squared masses implied by\n(3.3) and (3.6) are\nHeight 1 : m2\u03b11 = m\n2\n\u03b12\n= m2\u03b13 = m\n2\n\u03b14\n= m2 ;\nHeight 2 : m2\u03b11+\u03b12 = m\n2(e20 + 2 + e\u221220) ,\nm2\u03b12+\u03b13 = m\n2(e35 + 2 + e\u221235) ,\nm2\u03b12+\u03b14 = m\n2(e80 + 2 + e\u221280) ;\nHeight 3 : m2\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13 = m\n2(e55 + e35 + e20 + 3 + e\u221220 + e\u221235 + e\u221255) ,\nm2\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b14 = m\n2(e100 + e80 + e20 + 3 + e\u221220 + e\u221280 + e\u2212100) ,\nm2\u03b13+\u03b12+\u03b14 = m\n2(e80 + e45 + e35 + 3 + e\u221235 + e\u221245 + e\u221280) ;\nHeight 4 : m2\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13+\u03b14 = m\n2(e100 + e80 + e55 + e45 + e35 + e20 + 4\n+ e\u221220 + e\u221235 + e\u221245 + e\u221255 + e\u221280 + e\u2212100) ;\nHeight 5 : m2\u03b11+2\u03b12+\u03b13+\u03b14 = m\n2(e100 + 2e80 + e55 + e45 + 2e35 + 2e20 + 7\n+ 2e\u221220 + 2e\u221235 + e\u221245 + e\u221255 + 2e\u221280 + e\u2212100) . (3.16)\nDropping subleading terms and taking square roots, the theory therefore has six separated\n9\nmass scales:\nmii = m (\u223c m\u03b11 , m\u03b12 , m\u03b13 , m\u03b14 )\nm12 = me\n10 (\u223c m\u03b11+\u03b12 )\nm23 = me\n17.5 (\u223c m\u03b12+\u03b13 )\nm13 = me\n27.5 (\u223c m\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13 )\nm24 = me\n40 (\u223c m\u03b12+\u03b14 , m\u03b13+\u03b12+\u03b14 )\nm14 = me\n50 (\u223c m\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b14 , m\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13+\u03b14 , m\u03b11+2\u03b12+\u03b13+\u03b14 ) (3.17)\nComparing with the masses following from (3.8), one is missing, namely m34 = me\n22.5 .\nThe reason for its absence is that, while (m34)\n2 = m2e45 does appear in certain of the sums\nin (3.16), it does not dominate any of them, and hence m34 is always hidden underneath\nother scales; in particular, any m2\u03b2 which might contain m\n2\n34 also contains m\n2\n24 , and\nm24 \u226b m34. In other words, for the choice (3.15) of parameters, the scale m34 is shielded\nby m24. To see that this shielding also follows from condition (3.12), figure 3 below shows\nthe \u2018telegraph wire\u2019 diagrams for the chains of simple roots relevant for the mass scales\nm14, m13 and m34. (For those viewing the figures in black-and-white, the red sections of\nwire have been made thicker than the other parts.)\nClearly, figures 3a and 3b meet condition (3.12), while figure 3c does not. In the\nnext section this rephrasing of the shielding criterion will be used to show in complete\ngenerality that the separated mass scales in the quantum theory, as seen in the finite-size\ncrossover effects described by the TBA equations, precisely match those of the classical\ntheory.\n4 The quantum theory\n4.1 The TBA equations\nThe thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) is an exact method for the calculation of\nthe ground state energy of an integrable quantum field theory on a circle of circumference\nR or, equivalently, the free energy of the same theory at finite temperature T = R\u22121 [24].\nThis allows the theory to be studied non-perturbatively at all length scales, by varying\nthe value of R. The key input to the method is the set of two-particle S-matrix elements\nfor the scattering of stable particle states, and these were proposed for the simply-laced\nHSG models in [3]. The masses of the one-particle states are given by the formula (2.4),\nwithM an overall (quantum) mass scale. The scattering is diagonal, and to emphasise the\nsimilarities that the resulting TBA systems have with those which had previously arisen\nin the contexts of perturbed coset theories [25, 26, 27] and staircase models [28, 29], we\nshall rewrite the S-matrix elements of [3] in a slightly modified notation. Borrowing from\n[28], define two functions\nSminab (\u03b8) =\n\u220f\nx\u2208Aab\n{\nx\n}\n(\u03b8) , SFab(\u03b8) =\n\u220f\nx\u2208Aab\n(\nx\n)\n(\u03b8) , (4.1)\nwhere Aab is the set of integers {a+ b+ 1\u2212 2l}min(a,b)l=1 , and the blocks{\nx\n}\n=\n(\nx\u22121)(x+1) , (x)(\u03b8) = sinh 12(\u03b8 + ipixk )\nsinh 1\n2\n(\u03b8 \u2212 ipix\nk\n)\n(4.2)\n10\n(1)\n(2)\n(4)\n\u221240\u221280 40 800\n3a) The chain for m14 .\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n3b) The chain for m13 .\n(3)\n(2)\n(4)\n3c) The chain for m34 .\nFigure 3: Telegraph wire diagrams for the would-be scales m14, m13 and m34 in the d4 example\nof section 3.\nare as in [30]. The two-particle scattering amplitudes are then\nSia\ni\nb(\u03b8) = S\nmin\nab (\u03b8) (4.3)\nSia\nj\nb(\u03b8) =\n[\n(\u03b7ij)\nab SFab(\u03b8 + \u03c3ij)\n]\u2212Igij for i 6= j , (4.4)\nwhere \u03b8 is the rapidity, Ig is the incidence matrix of g, and \u03b7ij = \u03b7\n\u22121\nji are arbitrary\n(fixed) kth roots of \u22121. Recall that the functions SFab(\u03b8) sometimes fail, by a sign, to\nsatisfy the bootstrap and crossing equations holding for Sminab (\u03b8) [28]; in contrast, the\nscattering amplitudes Sia\nj\nb(\u03b8) do satisfy them due to the constant factors \u03b7ij [3]. The\nnumbers \u03c3ij = \u2212\u03c3ji = \u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j are the real-valued resonance parameters seen earlier; since\nthey need only be defined for Igij = 1, there is an independent resonance parameter for\neach of the rg \u2212 1 links on the Dynkin diagram of g. An integral representation for these\nscattering amplitudes was given in [5].\nUnlike the resonance parameters, the relative mass scales do not appear explicitly\nin the S-matrix. Instead, they emerge when the TBA equations are introduced. These\nequations have the standard form for a diagonal scattering theory, though care is needed\nin their derivation owing to the parity-breaking of the model [5]. There is a pseudoenergy\n11\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8) for each of the (k\u22121) \u00d7 rg stable particles; the mass scales mi influence them via\n(k\u22121)\u00d7 rg energy terms\n\u03bdia(\u03b8) = M\ni\naR cosh \u03b8 = mi\u00b5ar cosh \u03b8 (4.5)\nwhere \u00b5a = sin(\u03c0a\/k)\/ sin(\u03c0\/k) as before, and r is a dimensionless overall crossover scale:\nr =MR .

(4.11)\nA bulk term linear in R may also contribute to E(R), but this need not concern us here \u2013\nmost of the physically-relevant information from the point of view of RG flows is already\ncontained in c(r). Note that c(r) depends not only on r, but also on the rg mass scales\n{mi} and the rg \u2212 1 resonance parameters {\u03c3ij} : c(r) = c(r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}). However, since\nc(r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) = c(\u03b1r, {\u03b1\u22121mi}, {\u03c3ij}) (4.12)\nthe effective central charge depends non-trivially on just (2rg\u22121) parameters, one of which\ncan be chosen to be the dimensionless overall crossover scale.\nThe limiting value of c(r) as r \u2192 0 with all other parameters fixed is equal, in unitary\ncases such as these, to the central charge of the conformal field theory which is the far\nUV limit of the theory. For the HSG theories this was calculated in [5], with the result\nlim\nr\u21920\nc(r) =\nk \u2212 1\nk + hg\nhgrg , (4.13)\nwhich is the central charge of the Gk\/U(1)\nrg coset CFT. This holds for any fixed choice\nof the rg relative mass scales 0 < mi < +\u221e and the rg \u2212 1 resonance parameters \u2212\u221e <\n\u03c3ij < +\u221e. In the opposite, r \u2192 \u221e, limit, c(r) tends to zero, as expected for a massive\ntheory.\n12\n4.2 The staircase flow\nThe value of the central charge in the far UV is not the only information hidden inside\nthe HSG TBA equations. For intermediate values of r, depending on the values taken by\nthe {mi} and the {\u03c3ij}, numerical work has shown that the scaling function c(r) can have\na characteristic \u2018staircase\u2019 pattern, hinting at a renormalisation group flow which passes\nclose to a number of other fixed points. In contrast to Zamolodchikov\u2019s original staircase\nmodel [31] and its generalizations in [28, 32, 29], the number of steps is always finite.\nFurthermore, for the HSG models the staircase pattern can be understood physically, as\na consequence of the decoupling of those stable or unstable particles that are effectively\nheavy at the relative energy scale fixed by the temperature r\u22121. This was demonstrated\nfor the SU(3)k\/U(1)\n2 HSG models in [5, 7], but these cases are too simple to be affected\nby the subtleties about separable mass scales and shielding that were discussed in the last\nsection. Here we shall give a more general analysis, following a line of argument used for\nother staircase models in [28, 29]. This will allow a full understanding of the staircase\npattern to be gained, subject only to mild assumptions about the form of the solutions\nto (4.7). These assumptions are no more severe than those made in the analysis of the\nUV limit of more-usual TBA systems, but we have nevertheless verified our predictions\nnumerically in a number of particular cases. These checks, which also serve to illustrate\nthe patterns of flows, will be reported in section 4.5.\nWe shall work at a fixed (finite) value of k. Since our interest is in scales which can\nbe made arbitrarily well-separated, the constants \u00b5a = sin(\u03c0a\/k)\/ sin(\u03c0\/k) appearing in\nthe energy terms \u03bdia(\u03b8) = mi\u00b5ar cosh(\u03b8) can be taken to be of order one, and ignored for\nthe rest of the discussion. The pseudoenergies are then controlled by two sets of numbers:\nthe resonance parameters {\u03c3ij}, and the values of the stable mass scales relative to the\n(inverse) system size, mir, which are conveniently parametrised by defining\n\u03b8i(r) \u2261 ln( 2mir ) . (4.14)\nFor |\u03b8| \u226b \u03b8i(r), the energy terms \u03bdia(\u03b8) completely dominate the TBA equations for\nthe corresponding pseudoenergies, and as a result\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8) \u226b 1 for |\u03b8| \u226b \u03b8i(r) , a = 1 . . . k\u22121 . (4.15)\nThis causes the functions Lia(\u03b8) to suffer a double exponential decay in this region, and\nto the level of approximation to which we are working,\nLia(\u03b8) \u2248 0 for |\u03b8| \u226b \u03b8i(r) , a = 1 . . . k\u22121 . (4.16)\nAn important special case is\nLia(\u03b8) \u2248 0 \u2200 \u03b8 if \u03b8i(r)\u226a 0 . (4.17)\nIn this event the pseudoenergy \u03b5ia(\u03b8) contributes neither directly to the effective central\ncharge, nor indirectly via any influence on the values of the other pseudoenergies. This\nhappens when 2\/r \u226a mi ; physically, it corresponds to the energy scale set by the system\nsize, R\u22121 =M\/r, being so much less than the mass scale of the (stable) particles of type\ni, Mmi, that these particles are effectively decoupled. Such decouplings have the effect\nof splitting the original HSG model into smaller HSG models.\n13\nSuch cases apart, there will be a region |\u03b8| \u226a \u03b8i(r) within which the energy terms\n\u03bdai (\u03b8) are exponentially small, allowing them to be dropped from the TBA equations:\n\u03bdia(\u03b8) \u2248 0 for |\u03b8| \u226a \u03b8i(r) , a = 1 . . . k \u2212 1 . (4.18)\nIn this region no immediate conclusion can be drawn about the values of the pseudoen-\nergies \u03b5ia(\u03b8), as they continue to interact with other pseudoenergies via the convolution\nterms. The key feature [28] of this interaction is that it is localised in rapidity-space: for\nreal values of \u03b8, the kernels \u03c6ab(\u03b8) and \u03c8ab(\u03b8) are peaked about \u03b8 = 0, and fall exponen-\ntially to zero outside a region of order one. In the absence of the resonance parameters\n\u03c3ji , this implies that, apart from the driving energy term, the value of any pseudoen-\nergy near a given value of \u03b8 is only influenced by the values of the other pseudoenergies\nnear that same value of \u03b8. (This lies behind the presence of \u2018kink\u2019 solutions in even the\nsimplest TBA systems [24].) For the HSG models, as for the earlier examples of stair-\ncase models, non-zero values of the resonance parameters cause the interactions between\npseudoenergies to be shifted, so that, for Igij 6= 0, the TBA equations (4.7) couple \u03b5ia(\u03b80)\nnot to \u03b5jb(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b80, but near \u03b8 = \u03b80 \u2212 \u03c3ji . In turn, each \u03b5jb(\u03b80 \u2212 \u03c3ji) interacts with\nfurther pseudoenergies \u03b5kc (\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b80\u2212\u03c3ji\u2212\u03c3kj = \u03b80\u2212\u03c3ki , for all k such that Igjk 6= 0.\nContinuing, it is clear that in the absence of the energy terms the TBA equations couple\nall pairs of pseudoenergies, with \u03b5ia(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b80 interacting with \u03b5\nj\nb(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b80\u2212\u03c3ji\nvia a unique sequence of pairwise interactions along the links of the Dynkin diagram.\nThe fact that the non-affine Dynkin diagrams are trees, together with the antisym-\nmetry of \u03c3ij , means that the set of rapidities \u03b80 \u2212 \u03c3ji with which the pseudoenergy\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8) at \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b80 interacts is finite. This contrasts with the original staircase models\nof [31, 32, 28, 29], where for non-zero values of the resonance parameter and in the ab-\nsence of energy terms the psedoenergies are coupled at infinitely-many shifted values of \u03b8.\nThis distinction is the reason why the TBA equations for the original staircase models\ncan show an infinite number of steps, while for the HSG models the number of steps is\nalways finite7.\nWe now return to the effect of the energy terms, which bring the scale-dependence into\nthe TBA equations. Select a pair of nodes i and j on the Dynkin diagram, and suppose\nthat r is such that\n\u03b8i(r)\u226b 0 and \u03b8j(r)\u226b 0 , (4.19)\nso that neither node is decoupled. For \u03b8 \u2248 \u00b1\u03b8i(r), the energy term \u03bdia(\u03b8) entering the\nTBA equation for \u03b5ia is of the same order as the convolution term; at these values of \u03b8,\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8) has a non-trivial behaviour, and at generic values of r has the form of a so-called\n\u2018kink solution\u2019 [24] of the TBA equations. Likewise, \u03b5ja(\u03b8) generally has a kink behaviour\nfor \u03b8 \u2248 \u2213\u03b8j(r). However, these two would-be kinks may influence each other via the\nchains of convolution terms just discussed. For values of r such that this occurs, the\nsolution of the TBA system will depend on r in a non-trivial way, causing the value of the\neffective central charge to change and signalling a crossover in the finite-size behaviour of\nthe model.\n7It may be instructive to make the relationship between the spiral staircase models constructed in [29]\nand the HSG models more explicit. Each spiral staircase model is associated with a simply-laced Lie\nalgebra G and a cyclic group Zn, which can be viewed as the Dynkin diagram of the affine algebra a(1)n\u22121.\nThen, for G = ak\u22121, the TBA equations defining the spiral staircase model can be seen as the TBA\nequations of the SU(n)k\/U(1)\nn\u22121 HSG model with a particular (limiting) choice for the energy terms\nand resonance parameters, and with an\u22121 replaced by a\n(1)\nn\u22121.\n14\nTwo conditions must be satisfied for the interaction to occur. Taking the shift \u03c3ij\nmoving from node i to node j into account, the first is that either\n\u03b8i(r)\u2212 \u03c3ji \u2248 \u2212\u03b8j(r) or \u2212 \u03b8i(r)\u2212 \u03c3ji \u2248 \u03b8j(r) , (4.20)\ndepending on whether \u03c3ji > 0 or \u03c3ji < 0, respectively. Both cases are summarised by\n\u03b8i(r) + \u03b8j(r) \u2248 |\u03c3ij| , (4.21)\nwhere the presence of the modulus sign is consistent with the requirement that both \u03b8i(r)\nand \u03b8j(r) be non-negative. Rearranging, the condition is\n2\nr\n\u2248 \u221amimj e |\u03c3ij |\/2 . (4.22)\nIn other words, r \u2248 2\/mij, and the physical system size R is of the order of the length-\nscale set by Mmij . Taken over all values of i and j, this yields exactly the set of crossover\nscales that one would predict on the basis of a na\u00a8\u0131ve analysis of the set (3.8) of classical\nmass scales.\nHowever, the simple picture of a crossover for every pair of pseudoenegies, caused by\nthe interaction between the corresponding pairs of kink systems, can break down once\nthe effects of other energy terms are taken into consideration. According to (4.16), the\nenergy terms force the functions Lla(\u03b8) to zero for |\u03b8| \u226b \u03b8l(r), irrespective of the values of\nany other pseudoenergies. To take this into account, an additional condition is required\nto ensure that the chain of interactions connecting the kinks for \u03b5ia(\u03b8) and \u03b5\nj\na(\u03b8) near to\n\u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b8i(r) and \u03b8 = \u2213\u03b8j(r) is actually effective. Suppose that \u03c3ji > 0, and let {i1 . . . in}\nbe the unique chain of adjacent nodes on the Dynkin diagram joining nodes i and j, so\nthat i1 = i and in = j. Then, for any p = 2 . . . n\u22121, the value of \u03b5ia(\u03b8) at \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8i(r) is\ncoupled to the value of \u03b5\nip\nb (\u03b8) at \u03b8 \u2248 \u03b8i(r) \u2212 \u03c3ipi provided that |\u03b8i(r) \u2212 \u03c3ipi| \u226a \u03b8ip(r).\nTherefore, taking (4.22) into account, the required interaction between kinks will only\ntake place if\n|\u03b8i(r)\u2212 \u03c3ipi| \u226a \u03b8ip(r) \u2200 p = 2 . . . n\u22121 at r \u2248\n2\nmij\n. (4.23)\nThis is identical to the classical condition summarised by eq. (3.12), which ensures that\nthe (classical) scale mij is not shielded, and really does appear as the dominant term in\nthe mass of some classical particle. Therefore, we deduce that there is a crossover in the\nfinite-size behaviour of the quantum model at r \u2248 2\/mij for each unshielded mass scale\nmij within the set of numbers given by eq. (3.8), where mi and \u03c3i are now the (quantum)\nTBA parameters. This is one of our main results: for given values of the parameters, the\nset of distinct mass scales picked up by the finite-size crossover behaviour as the system\nsize varies from zero to infinity is exactly the same as would have been predicted from an\nexamination of the full set of classical particle masses, stable and unstable. This match\nincludes the shielding of classical scales that was discussed in section 3, and holds for all\nvalues of k, and not just semiclassically. Otherwise stated, for the quantum theory, the\nset of scales at which crossover phenomena occur is not {mij, i, j = 1 . . . rg}, but rather\n{m\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+g }, just as in the classical theory.\nThese non-perturbative results also provide a quantitative test for the accuracy of\nthe identifications of M\u03c1 and MR, as defined in section 2, with the physical mass scales\n15\nof the unstable particles. Take two neighbouring nodes on the Dynkin diagram of g,\nsay {i, j}, and consider the simple pole of the amplitude Si1j1(\u03b8) at \u03b8Rij = \u03c3ji \u2212 i\u03c0\/k.\nAs explained just after (2.8), when \u03c3ji > 0 this pole is expected to be the trace of the\nunstable particle associated with the root \u03b1i + \u03b1j, of height two. At level k = 2 in the\nlimit \u03c3ji \u226b ln(m2i +m2j )\/mimj , the two standard candidates to characterise the mass of\nthis particle, from (2.9), are:\nM\u03c1ij =M\n\u221a\nm2i +m\n2\nj and MRij \u2248M\n\u221a\nmimj\n2\ne \u03c3ji\/2 =\nMmij\u221a\n2\n. (4.24)\nFor this range of parameters, the mass scalemij is unshielded, som\u03b1i+\u03b1j \u2248 mij . Moreover,\naccording to our results, the finite-size behaviour of the quantum model has a crossover\nat 1\/r \u2248 mij\/2, a consequence of the decoupling of the unstable particles associated with\nthe root \u03b1i + \u03b1j. This singles out Mm\u03b1i+\u03b1j \u2248 Mmij as the physical mass scale of the\nunstable particle and, comparing with (4.24) and taking into account the approximate\nnature of the mass scales provided by the study of finite-size effects, shows that MRij\nprovides the correct value for the mass scale of this unstable particle. In contrast, the\nvalue ofM\u03c1ij can be made arbitrarily far from the value ofMm\u03b1i+\u03b1j by letting \u03c3ji tend to\ninfinity. In this case, our results clearly favour the use of MR = Re(\n\u221a\nsR) to characterise\nthe mass scale of the unstable particles against the more standard choice M\u03c1 =\n\u221a\nRe(sR).\nFor k > 2, and for the same values of the parameters, the position of the pole on the\ncomplex s-plane is sRij \u2248 (Mmij)2e\u2212i\npi\nk (see (2.8)). This leads to the following values of\nthe two candidate masses:\nM\u03c1ij \u2248Mm\u03b1i+\u03b1j\n\u221a\ncos\n\u03c0\nk\nand MRij \u2248Mm\u03b1i+\u03b1j cos\n\u03c0\n2k\n, (4.25)\nwhich coincide in the large k limit, as expected. However, even at finite values of k \u2265 3,\nand in contrast to the k = 2 case, it is not possible to make an unambiguous choice\nbetween M\u03c1 and MR .\n4.3 The central charges on the plateaux\nAt a crossover, the value of the effective central charge c(r) changes rapidly; between\nany two separated crossovers it remains approximately constant. The next task is to\ncalculate this constant, as it will help us to identify the fixed point being visited by the\nstaircase flow. The calculation is largely standard; for the aspects peculiar to staircase\nmodels, see also [28, 29].\nTo place ourselves far from all crossovers, we suppose that | ln(2\nr\n) \u2212 lnmij | \u226b 0 for\nall i, j such that the scale mij is unshielded. (Since we are anticipating that some of\nthe scales mij may be well-separated, this does not exclude ln(\n2\nr\n) lying between two\ndifferent crossover scales.) In addition, to simplify the initial analysis we suppose that the\nparameters are such that there are no \u2018accidental\u2019 degeneracies between unshielded scales\nof the form mii \u2248 mij . (The precise reasons for these conditions, and what happens when\nthey are broken, will be discussed in section 4.4 below.)\nThe effective central charge is given by (4.10), which we rewrite as\nc(r) =\nrg\u2211\np=1\ncp(r) (4.26)\n16\nwhere\ncp(r) =\n3\n\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8 \u03bdpa(\u03b8) L\np\na(\u03b8) (4.27)\nis the direct contribution of the pth set of pseudoenergies to c(r). Since \u03bdpa(\u03b8) \u2248 0 for\n|\u03b8| \u226a \u03b8p(r), and Lpa(\u03b8) \u2248 0 for |\u03b8| \u226b \u03b8p(r), this integral is dominated by the values taken\nby Lpa(\u03b8) at \u03b8 \u2248 \u00b1\u03b8p(r) if \u03b8p(r)\u226b 0, and is zero if \u03b8p(r)\u226a 0. (Note, \u03b8p(r) \u2248 0 corresponds\nto | ln(2\nr\n) \u2212 lnmpp| being small. Since mpp is never shielded, this is already excluded by\nthe requirement that r be far from all crossover values.)\nSuppose that \u03b8p(r)\u226b 0. Since \u03bdpa(\u03b8) = mp\u00b5ar cosh \u03b8, we have\ncp(r) = c\n\u2212\np (r) + c\n+\np (r) , (4.28)\nwhere\nc\u00b1p (r) =\n3\n2\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8 mp\u00b5are\n\u00b1\u03b8Lpa(\u03b8) =\n3\n\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8 \u00b5ae\n\u2212\u03b8p(r)\u00b1\u03b8Lpa(\u03b8) (4.29)\nare the \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 contributions of the pth pseudoenergy to the effective central\ncharge: c\u2212p (r) is dominated by the values of L\np\na(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u2212\u03b8p(r), and c+p (r) by the\nvalues near \u03b8 = +\u03b8p(r). The approximate values of Lpa(\u03b8) in these two regions are de-\ntermined by a pair of \u2018effective\u2019 kink TBA systems. These can be found using again the\nfacts that the kernel functions couple pseudoenergies which are adjacent on the Dynkin\ndiagram of g at values of \u03b8 shifted by the resonance parameters, and that these chains of\ninteracting pseudoenergies are cut whenever other energy terms force the functions Lja(\u03b8)\nto zero. To specify the effective systems precisely, let g\u02dc\u00b1p (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) be the (possibly\ndisconnected) Dynkin diagram obtained by deleting all nodes j on the Dynkin diagram of\ng for which |\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212\u03c3jp| \u226b \u03b8j(r), and let g\u00b1p (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) be the connected component\nof g\u02dc\u00b1p (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) containing the node p. Then, for all nodes i \u2208 g\u00b1p and to leading\napproximation,\nLia(\u03b8)|\u03b8\u2248\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212\u03c3ip \u2248 L\ni\na(\u03b8 \u2213 \u03b8p(r) + \u03c3ip)\u00b1 ;\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8)|\u03b8\u2248\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212\u03c3ip \u2248 \u03b5\ni\na(\u03b8 \u2213 \u03b8p(r) + \u03c3ip)\u00b1 , (4.30)\nwhere Lia(\u03b8)\n\u00b1 = ln(1 + e\u03b5\ni\na(\u03b8)\n\u00b1\n) and the effective TBA system solved by the \u2018kink pseu-\ndoenergies\u2019 \u03b5ia(\u03b8)\n\u00b1 is found by substituting the definitions (4.30) into (4.7) and dropping\nall subleading terms:\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8)\n\u00b1 = \u03b4ip \u00b5ae\u00b1\u03b8 \u2212\nk\u22121\u2211\nb=1\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u03c6ab \u2217 Lib(\u03b8)\u00b1 + \u2211\nj\u2208g\u00b1p\nI\ng\u00b1p\nij \u03c8ab \u2217 Ljb(\u03b8)\u00b1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 . (4.31)\nHere I\ng\u00b1p\nij is the incidence matrix of the reduced Dynkin diagram g\n\u00b1\np . (Note, g\n\u00b1\np in fact\ndepends on r, {mi} and {\u03c3ij} , but this has been left implicit to avoid overburdening the\nnotation.) In terms of the kink pseudoenergies, c\u00b1p (r) is simply\nc\u00b1p (r) =\n3\n\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8 \u00b5ae\n\u00b1\u03b8Lpa(\u03b8)\n\u00b1 . (4.32)\n17\nThe rapidity shifts in (4.30) serve to eliminate all relative rapidity shifts in the effective\nTBA system (4.31), though of course these shifts still influence the system indirectly, via\ntheir role in the determination of the diagram g\u00b1p . With all shifts removed, the effective\nTBA is exactly the kink form of a \u2018Dynkin\u2019 TBA system, of the sort discussed in [27].\nNotice that there is no explicit r-dependence \u2013 the value of r only enters via its effect on\ng\u00b1l (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) . This does not change between crossovers, and so the expected plateau\nstructure is confirmed.\nThe integral in (4.32) can be evaluated exactly as a sum of dilogarithms. Such sums\nhave been well-studied (see, for example, [33]), and their values can be expressed in terms\nof Lie-algebraic data, as follows. Let g\u00b1p be defined as above, and let g\u0302\n\u00b1\np be the (possibly\ndisconnected) Dynkin diagram formed by deleting the node p from g\u00b1p . For any connected\nDynkin diagram g \u2208 a, d, e with rank r and Coxeter number h, define Ck(g) by\nCk(g) =\nk \u2212 1\nk + h\nhr (4.33)\nand if g is disconnected, define Ck(g) to be the sum of (4.33) over all connected components\nof g. Then\nc\u00b1p =\n1\n2\n(Ck(g\n\u00b1\np )\u2212 Ck(g\u0302\u00b1p )) . (4.34)\nNote, Ck(g) is the central charge of the Gk\/U(1)\nr coset; the factor of 1\n2\nappears in (4.34)\nbecause the full effective central charge is the sum of two contributions, one from the left\nand one from the right kink system. As we shall see in an example shortly, the parity-\nbreaking of the HSG models means that in general the individual terms c+p and c\n\u2212\np are\nnot directly related, a contrast to the behaviour of more usual systems. However, the\neffective central charge c(r) is not sensitive to parity-breaking, in the sense that the total\n\u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 contributions are equal; i.e.,\nrg\u2211\np=1\nc+p (r) =\nrg\u2211\np=1\nc\u2212p (r) , (4.35)\nwhich is proved in appendix A.\nThe rules we have given here allow the unambiguous calculation of c(r) in generic\nsituations, away from any crossovers. The calculation of the plateau values is not exact\nbecause, for finite values of the \u03b8i(r) and \u03c3ij , the pseudoenergies approximated by the\ndifferent effective kink TBA systems actually interact with each other, as they correspond\nto the behaviours in different regions of a single set of functions. If a limit could be taken\nsuch that the separation between these different regions became infinite, then the plateau\nvalue for the effective central charge would be exact. This cannot be achieved simply by\ntaking r to zero \u2013 this would just reproduce the far UV central charge of the model in\nevery case. Instead, to capture the intermediate plateaux, a more subtle \u2018multiple scaling\nlimit\u2019 should be taken. The simplest choice is to settle on a finite set of parameters\n{\u03b8i(r), \u03c3ij} away from any crossover, and then rescale as\n{\u03b8i(r), \u03c3ij} \u2192 {\u03c1\u03b8i(r), \u03c1\u03c3ij} (4.36)\nfor some positive real number \u03c1. In the limit \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, the plateau values of the effective\ncentral charge, calculated using the above rules, become exact. In terms of the original\ninfrared parameters this limit is essentially\n{r,mi, \u03c3ij} \u2192 {2\n(r\n2\n)\u03c1\n, m\u03c1i , \u03c1\u03c3ij} ; \u03c1\u2192\u221e. (4.37)\n18\nIt is interesting that a single TBA system can hide such a variety of exact limits. Similar\nremarks in the simpler context of the traditional staircase models were made in [28, 29].\n4.4 Effective TBA systems for the crossovers\nThe appearance of just a single \u2018driving term\u2019 \u03b4ip \u00b5ae\n\u00b1\u03b8 in each kink TBA system\n(4.31) is a consequence of the conditions that r should be far from any crossovers, and\nthat there should be no accidental degeneracies between unshielded scales of the form\nmii \u2248 mij . This can be shown as follows. Consider the value of \u03b5pa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b8p(r),\nwhere the balance between the energy and convolution terms in its TBA equation causes\nit to have a non-trivial form. Via a chain of links on the Dynkin diagram of g, this form\nmight be influenced by \u03b5qa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b8p(r) \u2212 \u03c3qp (here q labels another node on the\nDynkin diagram of g). Now if |\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212 \u03c3qp| \u226b \u03b8q(r) then \u03b5qa(\u03b8) is completely dominated\nby the energy term at these values of \u03b8, and the chain is cut; and if |\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212\u03c3qp| \u226a \u03b8q(r),\nthen the energy term is effectively zero at these same values of \u03b8, and so no energy term\nfor \u03b5qa(\u03b8)\n\u00b1 should be included in the effective TBA system. The extra energy term needs\nonly be included explicitly if |\u00b1\u03b8p(r)\u2212 \u03c3qp| \u2248 \u03b8q(r), with the chain linking p to q uncut.\nThere are two cases: (a) \u03b8p(r) \u2213 \u03c3qp \u2248 \u03b8q(r) , or (b) \u2212\u03b8p(r) \u00b1 \u03c3qp \u2248 \u03b8q(r). Case (b)\nhas already appeared in eq. (4.20) above, and is ruled out if r is far from any crossover\nscale. Case (a) translates as mq\/mpe\n\u2213\u03c3qp \u2248 1. Since (mpq\/mqq)2 = (mp\/mq)e|\u03c3qp| and\n(mpp\/mpq)\n2 = (mp\/mq)e\n\u2212|\u03c3qp|, this is ruled out by the condition on coincidental mass\nscales.\nWhen the conditions are not met, the decoupling of the full TBA into separate effective\nsystems, one for each still-active energy term, is not complete. The effective TBA systems\nfor any set of energy terms which have not been disentangled must be combined into\none, which itself has more than one driving term. Suppose for illustration that just one\nextra driving term, coming from \u03b5qa(\u03b8), needs to be included in the effective TBA system\ngoverning the form of \u03b5pa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b8p(r). (The modifications to the discussion when\nan extra term is instead needed for the system governing \u03b5pa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u2212\u03b8p(r), or\nwhen larger numbers of extra energy terms are involved, should then be clear.) Case (a)\ncorresponds to \u03b8p(r) \u2212 \u03c3qp \u2248 \u03b8q(r), and it follows from the definitions made just before\neq. (4.30) that the reduced diagrams g+p (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) and g+q (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}) coincide.\nThe effective TBA systems governing \u03b5pa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b8p(r) and \u03b5\nq\na(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b8q(r)\nshould therefore be merged. Defining kink pseudoenergies as in (4.30), there are two\nenergy terms which cannot be discarded and the effective system is\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8)\n+ = \u03b4ip \u00b5ae\n\u03b8+ \u03b4iq \u00b5a\nmq\nmp\ne\u2212\u03c3qpe\u03b8\u2212\nk\u22121\u2211\nb=1\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u03c6ab \u2217 Lib(\u03b8)+ + \u2211\nj\u2208g\u00b1\nl\nI\ng\u00b1\nl\nij \u03c8ab \u2217 Ljb(\u03b8)+\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 (4.38)\nand the separate contributions of c+p (r) and c\n+\nq (r) to the total effective central charge\nshould be replaced by\nc+p+q(r) =\n3\n\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8\n(\n\u00b5ae\n\u03b8Lpa(\u03b8)\n+ + \u00b5a\nmq\nmp\ne\u2212\u03c3qpe\u03b8Lqa(\u03b8)\n+\n)\n. (4.39)\nNote that the \u2018coincidence condition\u2019 \u03b8p(r) \u2212 \u03c3qp \u2248 \u03b8q(r) implies that (mq\/mp)e\u2212\u03c3qp is\nof order 1. This term cannot be eliminated from the equations without reintroducing\n19\na rapidity shift for the second convolution term in (4.38), but the apparent asymmetry\nbetween p and q can be removed by making an overall shift \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + lnmp + \u03c3qp\/2. The\nvalue of c+p+q is calculated as for the generic plateau case discussed in the last section,\nthe only difference being that the diagram g\u0302+p is now found by deleting both nodes p and\nq from g+p , instead of just node p. From this it follows that the value of c\n\u00b1\np+q is in fact\nindependent of (mq\/mp)e\n\u2212\u03c3qp , and it is easy to check from the rules for calculation given\nabove that its value is consistent with the value of c\u00b1p + c\n\u00b1\nq found when (mq\/mp)e\n\u2212\u03c3qp\nbecomes large (or small) and the p and q kink systems decouple. Physically this is as\nit should be \u2013 the approximate equality of the scales mpp and mpq will only be seen in\nthe finite-size behaviour of the system at the corresponding crossovers, and the scale r at\nwhich this calculation has been performed is away from all crossovers.\nFor case (b), the story is different and gives the archetypal approximation for the\nfinite-size behaviour during a crossover. We have \u03b8p(r)\u2212\u03c3qp \u2248 \u2212\u03b8q(r), with \u03c3qp > 0 since\nwe have already supposed that both \u03b8p(r) and \u03b8q(r) be positive. The reduced diagrams\ng+p and g\n\u2212\nq coincide, and the effective TBA systems governing \u03b5\np\na(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u03b8p(r) and\n\u03b5qa(\u03b8) near \u03b8 = \u2212\u03b8q(r) should be merged. As the first system involves e\u03b8 in its energy term\nand the second e\u2212\u03b8, it is no longer possible to eliminate all r-dependence by an overall\nshift in \u03b8. If kink pseudoenergies are again defined as in (4.30), the effective system is\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8)\n+ = \u03b4ip \u00b5ae\n\u03b8 + \u03b4iq \u00b5a\nmpmq\n4\ne\u03c3qpr2 e\u2212\u03b8 \u2212\nk\u22121\u2211\nb=1\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u03c6ab \u2217 Lib(\u03b8)+ + \u2211\nj\u2208g\u00b1p\nI\ng\u00b1p\nij \u03c8ab \u2217 Ljb(\u03b8)+\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\n(4.40)\nUsing m2pq = mpmqe\n\u03c3qp (recall that \u03c3qp is positive), shifting \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8 + ln(mpq\/2) and\nredefining the pseudoenergies appropriately, this can be put in the more symmetrical\nform\n\u03b5ia(\u03b8)\n+ = 1\n2\n\u03b4ip \u00b5ampqr e\n\u03b8 + 1\n2\n\u03b4iq \u00b5ampqr e\n\u2212\u03b8 \u2212\nk\u22121\u2211\nb=1\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u03c6ab \u2217 Lib(\u03b8)+ + \u2211\nj\u2208g\u00b1p\nI\ng\u00b1p\nij \u03c8ab \u2217 Ljb(\u03b8)+\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 .\n(4.41)\nThe contribution to the effective central charge, which replaces c+p (r) + c\n\u2212\nq (r), is then\n8\nc+p+q(r) =\n3\n\u03c02\nk\u22121\u2211\na=1\n\u222b +\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03b8\n(\n1\n2\n\u00b5ampqr e\n\u03b8Lpa(\u03b8)\n+ + 1\n2\n\u00b5ampqr e\n\u2212\u03b8Lqa(\u03b8)\n+\n)\n. (4.42)\nThese equations make it particularly clear that the crossover scale is mpq. Considered on\ntheir own, these HSG crossover TBA systems generalise massless TBAs discussed in [27],\nin that there is no requirement for the nodes p and q to be symmetrically-placed on the\nDynkin diagram of g. This greater freedom is related to the fact that the HSG models can\nbreak parity, an option not treated in [27]. Note also that we only discussed the simplest\ncases here; by suitably tuning the parameters it can be arranged for more driving terms to\nbe present in the effective TBA systems, giving, for example, new multiparameter families\nof massless flows which may or may not break parity.\n8Beware that the \u2018+\u2019 label we associated with this effective TBA system is potentially misleading,\nas it actually arises from the merging of a \u2018+\u2019 kink system with a \u2018\u2212\u2019 kink system, but for the sake of\nsimplicity we do not introduce a further notation.\n20\n4.5 Examples\nWe now outline some specific examples, starting with the SU(4)2\/U(1)\n3 HSG model,\nfor which a number of numerically-obtained plots are shown in figure 4.\nFigure 4: The TBA scaling functions for the SU(4)2\/U(1)3 HSG model.\nSimplest to describe is the flow with both resonance parameters zero: \u03c312 = \u03c323 = 0,\ndrawn as a dashed line on the plot. The mass scales are such thatm1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3.\n9 As r\nvaries from 0 and +\u221e, the effective central charge exhibits three plateaux corresponding to\nthe regions 2r\u22121 \u226b m3 (the deep UV limit), m2 \u226a 2r\u22121 \u226a m3, andm1 \u226a 2r\u22121 \u226a m2,\nbefore it reaches the massive region for 2r\u22121 \u226a m1 where c(r) vanishes. Within each\nregion, c(r) matches the central charges of the following coset CFTs:\n(UV)\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\nm3\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(3)k\nU(1)2\nm2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(2)k\nU(1)\nm1\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Massive (IR) . (4.43)\nThe central charges can be recovered using the rules given above as follows. We return to\nthe \u2018telegraph wire\u2019 diagrams of the last section, but this time allow them to depend on\nr (the previous \u2018chain\u2019 diagrams occur as subdiagrams when r is placed at the relevant\ncrossover scale). Draw a wire for every node of the Dynkin diagram of g (in this case,\nthat for a3), give each wire a coordinate \u03b8, and paint red those parts of the l\nth wire with\n|\u03b8| > \u03b8l(r) , for l = 1 . . . rg . The diagram g\u00b1l is found by first drawing a node for the\n\u2018driving\u2019 point \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03b8l(r) on the lth wire. (If \u03b8l(r) is negative, then \u03b5la(\u03b8) is already\ndecoupled, and no node need be drawn.) Then move from wire to wire of the diagram\naccording to the connectivity of the Dynkin diagram, shifting in \u03b8 by \u03c3ij when moving\nfrom wire i to wire j. So long as the points reached lie on unpainted sections of wire, then\nthey should be included in g\u00b1l . It is easily checked that this graphical technique matches\nthe rule for the construction of g\u00b1l given just before (4.30).\n9We continue to use the conventions of fig. 2 for numbering the nodes of the Dynkin diagram of g.\n21\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n5a) ln(m1r\/2) = \u221230.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n5b) ln(m1r\/2) = \u221215.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n5c) ln(m1r\/2) = \u22125.\nFigure 5: Effective TBA systems for the dashed-line flow in figure 4.\nFigure 5a shows the resulting collection of kink TBA systems for the dashed-line flow\nat ln(m1r\/2) = \u221230. The systems are symmetrical between left and right, so c+l = c\u2212l for\neach l and cl = 2c\n\u00b1\nl = Ck(g\n\u00b1\nl )\u2212 Ck(g\u0302\u00b1l ). Hence the total central charge is\nc = Ck(a1) + (Ck(a2)\u2212Ck(a1)) + (Ck(a3)\u2212Ck(a2)) = Ck(a3) (4.44)\nas expected for the far UV limit.\nIf instead ln(m1r\/2) = \u221215, the relevant diagram is drawn in figure 5b. The pseu-\ndoenergies \u03b53a have decoupled, and the central charge is\nc = Ck(a1) + (Ck(a2)\u2212Ck(a1)) = Ck(a2) . (4.45)\nFinally, at ln(m1r\/2) = \u22125 all pseudoenergies but \u03b51a have decoupled; the diagram is\nshown in figure 5c and the central charge is\nc = Ck(a1). (4.46)\nIn contrast, had the mass scales been chosen such that m1 \u2243 m3 \u226a m2, then c(r)\n22\nwould have exhibited only two plateaux with effective central charges matching a flow\n(UV)\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\nm2\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(2)k\nU(1)\n\u00d7 SU(2)k\nU(1)\nm1\u2243m3\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Massive (IR) . (4.47)\nWe leave it to the reader to verify this using the diagrammatic approach.\nParenthetically, for any HSG model, we remark that if all the resonance parameters\nvanish then the mass scales can be adjusted so as to permit the existence of a regime in\nthe RG flow from UV to IR where\nmi1 , . . . , mil \u226a 2r\n\u22121 \u226a mil+1 , . . . , mirg . (4.48)\nIn this portion of the flow all the particles of types \u2018il+1\u2019, . . ., \u2018irg \u2019 have already decoupled,\nwith L\nil+1\na (\u03b8), . . . , L\nirg\na (\u03b8) \u2248 0. This leaves us with the TBA equations corresponding to\nthe HSG model associated with the coset G\n[il+1...irg ]\nk \/U(1)\nrg , where G[il+1...irg ] denotes the\nsubgroup of G associated with the (possibly disconnected) Dynkin diagram obtained by\nremoving the il+1, . . . , irg\u2013th nodes from the Dynkin diagram of g, times a U(1)\nrg\u2212l factor\nassociated with those nodes. Physically, these staircase patterns reflect the decoupling of\nthe stable particles when they are heavy compared to the relative energy scale fixed by\nthe temperature r\u22121, and the possible splitting of the initial HSG model into a number\nof decoupled components.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n6a) ln(m1r\/2) = \u221235.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n6b) ln(m1r\/2) = \u221225.\nFigure 6: Effective TBA systems for the solid-line flow in figure 4.\nReturning to the SU(4)2\/U(1)\n3 examples of figure 4, we now analyse the flow shown\nas a solid line on figure 4, which breaks parity. In the far UV, which for this set of\nparameters can be found for ln(m1r\/2) = \u221235, the set of kink TBA systems is shown\nin figure 6a. Notice that, this time, the evident left-right symmetry has been lost. The\ncalculation of c goes otherwise as before, with the same (expected) result: c = Ck(a3).\n23\nIncreasing r through the first crossover, there is no decoupling of stable pseudoenergies,\nbut the effective kink systems determining the values of c\u22123 and c\n+\n2 change, as can be\nseen on figure 6b. (We have also shown, lightly-shaded, the parts of the kink systems\nwhich have been lost in the crossover.) Now c = Ck(a1) + (Ck(a2)\u2212Ck(a1)) + Ck(a1) =\nCk(a2) + Ck(a1). Again this is easily understood physically \u2013 the crossover corresponds\nto the unstable particle corresponding to the root \u03b12 + \u03b13 becoming relatively heavy\nand decoupling; this splits the SU(4)k\/U(1)\n3 HSG model into two decoupled parts, HSG\nmodels for SU(3)k\/U(1)\n2 and SU(2)k\/U(1), and makes it natural to conjecture that the\nfull flow is\n(UV)\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\nm23\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(3)k\nU(1)2\n\u00d7 SU(2)k\nU(1)\nm2=m3\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(2)k\nU(1)\nm1\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Massive (IR) . (4.49)\nNotice that the effective TBA system (4.41) governing the crossover at r\u22121 \u2248 m23 is of\nmassless type, but, since the driving terms are asymmetrically placed on the a3 Dynkin\ndiagram, it lies outwith the class of massless Dynkin TBA systems discussed in [27].\nFinally, figure 7 shows the sets of effective kink TBA systems for the four plateaux\nof the flow shown as a dotted line in figure 4, which are separated by crossovers at\nln(m1r\/2) \u2248 \u221235, \u221225, \u221210 and 0.\nA coset identification for the fixed points visited by the flow is\n(UV)\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\nm13\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(3)k\nSU(2)k \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7\nSU(3)k\nU(1)2\nm12\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 SU(2)k\nU(1)\n\u00d7 SU(3)k\nU(1)2\nm23\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n[\nSU(2)k\nU(1)\n]\u00d73\nmii\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Massive (IR) . (4.50)\nThis is the simplest example which inevitably involves a coset CFT not of parafermionic\ntype: here, SU(3)k\nSU(2)k\u00d7U(1) . By level-rank duality [34], this is\nSU(k)2\u00d7SU(k)1\nSU(k)3\n, the coset which\nmight have been more naturally suggested by a comparison of the effective TBA governing\nthe crossover with the results of [25, 26]. Note also that the step at highest energy (that\nfurthest into the UV) involves the mass scale m13 associated with the root \u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13,\nwhich is of height 3, and so corresponds to an unstable particle which is not seen directly\nin the two-particle S-matrix elements. Even so, the TBA picks it up with no problems,\nas expected given our general analysis.\nIn general, a knowledge of the effective central charge is not enough to identify a coset\nunambiguously. In particular, parity-breaking in the HSG models brings with it a number\nof interesting phenomena, to which we shall return in section 6 and appendix A. However,\nthe examples discussed above are sufficiently simple that these issues do not arise.\nSome flows for the two rank 4 simply-laced Lie algebras, a4 \u2261 SU(5) and d4 \u2261 SO(8),\nare shown in figure 8. Again, the locations and heights of the steps all agree with the\npredictions of the rules formulated above. These flows were already presented in [10, 11],\nwhere conjectures for the fixed points visited by each of them can be found. More about\nthe d4 case can be found around eq. (6.36) below, in the context of the Lagrangian\ntreatment of the flows.\nNotice that the two a4 flows have a different number of steps: 7 for the solid line, and\nonly 6 for the dashed line. This is a simple consequence of the fact that m12 = m24 for\nthe choice of parameters corresponding to the dashed-line flow, while the mass scales mij ,\ni 6= j, are all different for the solid line.

A na\u00a8\u0131ve analysis would\nhave predicted a crossover at ln(m1r\/2) = ln(m1\/m34) = \u221222.5, but this step is absent.\nThis absence is exactly as predicted by our analysis of shielding.\nBy separating the stable mass scales we can add 3 more steps to each flow, making a\ntotal of 10 for the a4 example corresponding to the solid line but only 9 for d4. Now, in\nspite of the phenomenon of shielding, one might have expected that the maximal number\nof steps for a given algebra would equal the maximal possible number of distinct scales mij\nin every case, which for rank 4 is rg(rg+1)\/2 = 10. Might a different choice of parameters\nfor d4 avoid the shielding, and produce a flow with the 10 steps we have already seen for\na4? In fact the answer to this question is no, as we now show.\n5 The maximal number of steps\nIn this section, we find, for a generic simply-laced Lie algebra, the maximal number\nof well-separated scales that can be found in the set of numbers {m\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+g }, as the\n2rg \u2212 1 parameters are varied. This is equal to the maximal number of well-separated\nsteps that can be found in the flow of the effective central charge of the corresponding\nquantum field theories.\nBy the results of section 3, the number of well-separated scales in {m\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+g }\nfor any given set of values of the parameters {mi} and {\u03c3j} is equal to the number of\nunshielded well-separated scales in {mij , i, j = 1 . . . rg}. Our strategy will be to start by\nmaximising the number of scales from this latter set which are unshielded, and only then\n26\nto worry about separating the unshielded scales so as to avoid any degeneracies.\nWe first take g = an, whose Dynkin diagram is simply a chain {1 . . . n} of n nodes,\nwhere {j, j + 1} are neighbours for j = 1 . . . n \u2212 1 (see fig. 2). This case is rather\ntrivial: consider the particular choice mj = e\nja and \u03c3j = jb, for two real numbers\na, b \u226b 0 such that a\/b is irrational. If we take a \u226a b, it is straightforward to check\nthat the constraints (3.11) are satisfied for all k, l, and so all of the mkl are unshielded.\nFurthermore, as in (3.9), these scales can be made arbitrarily far apart by taking a and\nb large. Therefore, for g = an, the maximal number of well-separated scales is equal to\nn(n + 1)\/2, which is also the number of positive roots.\nThe d and e cases are more tricky, and we shall exploit the fact that their Dynkin\ndiagrams always contain a\u2013type subdiagrams. As a preliminary, we claim that a necessary\ncondition for all of the scales mkl associated with an an diagram (or subdiagram) to be\nunshielded is that the resonance parameters {\u03c3i} and the stable-particle mass scales {mi}\nshould satisfy\n\u2022 \u2223\u2223ln (mi\/mi+1) | \u226a \u2223\u2223\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1\u2223\u2223 \u2200 i = 1 . . . n\u2212 1 (5.1)\nand\n\u2022 either \u03c31 \u226b \u03c32 \u226b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226b \u03c3n or \u03c31 \u226a \u03c32 \u226a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226a \u03c3n (5.2)\nIn order to prove this, notice that, from (3.11), the relevant conditions to ensure that all\nthe scales mkl be unshielded are\nmkl \u226b mpq \u2200 k, l, p, q such that 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p \u2264 q \u2264 l \u2264 n with {p, q} 6= {k, l} . (5.3)\nThese ensure that each mkl appears as the dominating term in m\u03b2 for the positive root\n\u03b2 =\n\u2211l\ni=k\u03b1i . Taking logs and rearranging, the inequality in (5.3) is equivalent to\n|\u03c3k\u2212\u03c3l| \u2212 |\u03c3p\u2212\u03c3q| \u226b ln(mp\/mk) + ln(mq\/ml) (5.4)\nThen, the need for (5.1) follows from (5.4) on setting k = p = q = i, l = i+1, and then\nk = i, p = q = l = i+1. The first choice gives\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1| \u226b ln(mi\/mi+1) (5.5)\nand the second\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1| \u226b ln(mi+1\/mi) . (5.6)\nCombining the two, (5.1) is recovered. To see the need for (5.2), suppose that the condition\ndoes not hold. Then there must be a sequence \u03c3i, \u03c3i+1, \u03c3i+2 such that either\n\u03c3i \u226b \u03c3i+1 \u226a \u03c3i+2 (5.7)\nor\n\u03c3i \u226a \u03c3i+1 \u226b \u03c3i+2 (5.8)\n(Note, \u03c3i \u223c \u03c3i+1 and \u03c3i+1 \u223c \u03c3i+2 are excluded by (5.1), which has already been estab-\nlished.) Consider (5.7), and suppose that \u03c3i \u2265 \u03c3i+2. Then\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+2| = \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+2 = \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1 + \u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i+2 = |\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1| \u2212 |\u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i+2| (5.9)\n27\nand so\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+2| \u2212 |\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1| = \u2212|\u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i+2| \u226a \u2212| ln(mi+1\/mi+2)| (5.10)\nusing (5.1) for the final inequality. On the other hand, (5.4) for k = p = i, q = i+1,\nl = i+2 is\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+2| \u2212 |\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3i+1| \u226b ln(mi+1\/mi+2) (5.11)\nThe contradiction with (5.10) rules out (5.7) with \u03c3i \u2265 \u03c3i+2 ; the other options are dealt\nwith similarly, establishing the necessity of (5.2).\nParenthetically we remark that not only are (5.1) and (5.2) necessary conditions for\nthe n(n + 1)\/2 scales {mkl} to be unshielded; they are also sufficient. Suppose that the\nfirst option of (5.2) holds. (The argument is trivially rewritten for the second option.)\nThen the LHS of (5.4) is equal to \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3p + \u03c3q \u2212 \u03c3l , while, using (5.1),\nln(mp\/mk) \u2264 | ln(mk\/mp)|\n\u2264 | ln(mk\/mk+1)|+ | ln(mk+1\/mk+2)|+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ | ln(mp\u22121\/mp)|\n\u226a \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3p . (5.12)\nLikewise, ln(mq\/ml) \u226a \u03c3q \u2212 \u03c3l , and so ln(mp\/mk) + ln(mq\/ml) \u226a \u03c3k \u2212 \u03c3p + \u03c3q \u2212 \u03c3l ,\nwhich is the required result.\nOnce the necessity of (5.1) and (5.2) has been established, it is easy to see that at least\none scale mkl must be shielded for the d and e cases. Condition (5.2) implies that the\nsequence {\u03c3ik} for any chain of nodes {ik} on the Dynkin diagram must be monotonic,\nsince otherwise one of the scales mikil associated with that chain will be shielded. Now the\nd and e Dynkin diagrams are forked, and it is clearly impossible to enforce simultaneous\nmonotonicity for the three maximal chains of nodes including the fork node. (For g = dn,\nthese are the chains {1 . . . n\u22121}, {1 . . . n\u22122, n}, and {n\u22121, n\u22122, n} in the labelling of\nfig. 2; for g = en, {1 . . . n\u22121}, {1 . . . n\u22123, n}, and {n\u22121, n\u22122, n\u22123, n}.) Hence, the\nnumber of unshielded scales certainly cannot exceed n(n+1)\/2 \u2212 1. To show that this\nnumber can be attained, and that the resulting n(n+1)\/2 \u2212 1 unshielded scales can be\nseparated, we resort again to explicit examples. For g = dn, one can take\n\u03c3i = ib \u2200i = 1 . . . n\u22121 , \u03c3n = \u03c3n\u22122 ,\nmi = e\nja \u2200j = 1 . . . n\u22121 , mn = e (n+1)a ,\n(5.13)\nand for g = en,\n\u03c3i = ib \u2200i = 1 . . . n\u22121 , \u03c3n = \u03c3n\u22123 ,\nmj = e\nja \u2200j = 1 . . . n\u22121 , mn = e na , (5.14)\nwhere in all cases a and b are real numbers,\u226b 0, such that a\/b is irrational, and b\u226b 4a. It\nis easy to check that the constraints (3.11) are satisfied for all k, l, with the only exceptions\nbeing {k, l} = {n\u22122, n} for g = dn, or {k, l} = {n\u22123, n} for g = en. This means that the\nscale mn\u22122,n (for g = dn) or mn\u22123,n (for g = en) is shielded. Moreover, all the unshielded\nscales mkl can be given arbitrarily well-separated magnitudes by choosing a and b large\nenough. Therefore, for g = dn and g = en, the maximal number of well-separated mass\nscales is n(n + 1)\/2\u2212 1.\n28\nFor g = dn, there is another generic way to arrange the parameters such that only one\nscale is shielded: suppose that\neither \u03c31 \u226a \u03c32 \u226a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226a \u03c3n\u22121 and \u03c3n\u22122 \u226a \u03c3n\nor \u03c31 \u226b \u03c32 \u226b \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u226b \u03c3n\u22121 and \u03c3n\u22122 \u226b \u03c3n , (5.15)\nand in addition \u2223\u2223ln (mi\/mj) | \u226a \u2223\u2223\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j\u2223\u2223 (5.16)\nfor each pair of neighbouring nodes {i, j}. Then, all the scales mij with i, j = 1 . . . n\u2212 1,\nand min with i = 1 . . . n\u2212 2, n are unshielded. In contrast, the number mn\u22121n is always\nswamped by other scales in the sums (3.6). All these numbers can be separated, as shown\nby the particular choice of parameters used in (3.9) with a\u226a b.\nA similar trick does not succeed for g = en because the shortest maximal chain in-\ncluding the fork node has length 4 rather than 3. In this case, the only choices of {mi, \u03c3i}\nleading to the maximal number of unshielded scales are those that satisfy the following\nconstraints. First, the parameters associated with the chain of nodes {1 . . . n\u22121} have to\nsatisfy the conditions (5.1) and (5.2), to ensure that all the scalesmkl with k, l = 1 . . . n\u22121\nare unshielded. Second, \u03c3n and mn have to be chosen such that\nmn \u226b mn\u22123 , |\u03c3n\u22123 \u2212 \u03c3n| . | ln(mn\u22123\/mn)| ,\n|\u03c3n\u22121 \u2212 \u03c3n| \u2212 |\u03c3n\u22122 \u2212 \u03c3n| \u226b ln(mn\u22122\/mn\u22121) ,\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3n| \u226b ln(mn\/mi) i = n\u2212 4, n\u2212 2 ,\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3n| \u2212 |\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3n\u22123| \u226b ln(mn\u22123\/mn) \u2200i = 1 . . . n\u2212 1 , i 6= n\u2212 3 ,\n|\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3n| \u2212 |\u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3n| \u226b ln(mi+1\/mi) \u2200i = 1 . . . n\u2212 5 . (5.17)\nThe proof of these conditions is based on the characterisation of the choices of parameters\nsuch that all but one of the scales associated with a given chain are unshielded, which\ncan be easily derived from (5.1) and (5.2). Since it is rather involved, it will be omitted.\nIt is straightforward to check that the values (5.14) satisfy (5.17).\nOur results for the maximal number of separable mass scales are summarised in table 1.\n(Note that this table corrects an error in the result for g = en reported in [11].)\ng Maximal number of separable scales\nan n(n+ 1)\/2 , n \u2265 1\ndn n(n+ 1)\/2\u2212 1 , n \u2265 4\nen n(n+ 1)\/2\u2212 1 , n = 6, 7, 8\nTable 1: The maximal number of separable scales for the HSG models associated with the\ndifferent simply-laced Lie groups (see also the comments in the last two paragraphs of section 5).\nSometimes, it is of interest to consider choices of the parameters with all the stable-\nparticle mass scales equal, so that mi = mj \u2200i, j. For such cases it is clear that the\nmaximal number of well-separated scales cannot be larger that the number quoted in\ntable 1, minus (n\u22121). For g = an and dn, this number can be attained, as can be shown\nvia an explicit example. In both cases, take\n\u03c3i = 2\nib \u2200i = 1 . . . n , (5.18)\n29\nwhere b is a real number \u226b 0. For g = an, this choice satisfies (5.1) and (5.2), and\nfor g = dn , (5.15) and (5.16). All of the resulting unshielded scales mkl can be given\narbitrarily well-separated values by choosing b large enough.\nHowever, for g = en, eq. (5.17) shows that mn \u226b mn\u22123 is a necessary condition to\nachieve the maximal number of unshielded scales. Therefore, by taking all the stable-\nparticle mass scales to be equal we lose at least one extra unshielded scale, and the\nresulting maximal number of well-separated scales cannot be larger than the number\nquoted in table 1 minus n. For an explicit example where this number is attained, one\ncan again take (5.18), which makes all of the scales mkl with k 6= l unshielded with the\nonly exception of mn\u22122 n and mn\u22121 n, and well-separated, by choosing b large enough.\n6 Crossovers from the Lagrangian approach\nThe original formulation of the HSG theories was in terms of a gauged WZW action\nmodified by a potential [1, 2]. This explicit Lagrangian definition provides a more physical\ninterpretation of the crossovers observed in the study of finite-size effects using the TBA,\nallowing them to be seen as consequences of changes in the number of the field configura-\ntions that remain effectively massless at the given finite-size (RG) scale. In addition, this\ninterpretation turns out to be very useful in elucidating the precise nature of the effective\nfield theories between well-separated crossovers. While such a semiclassical analysis is\nrather na\u00a8\u0131ve, it turns out to be surprisingly powerful.\nThe HSG theories corresponding to perturbations of the coset Gk\/U(1)\nrg have actions\nSHSG[\u03b3, A\u00b1] = k\n(\nSgWZW[\u03b3, A\u00b1] \u2212\n\u222b\nd2x V (\u03b3)\n)\n. (6.1)\nHere, \u03b3 = \u03b3(t, x) is a bosonic field that takes values in some faithful representation of the\ncompact Lie group G, and A\u00b1 are non-dynamical gauge fields taking values in the Cartan\nsubalgebra of g associated with H \u2243 U(1)rg , a maximal torus of G. Then, SgWZW is the\ngauged WZW action corresponding to the coset G\/H [35, 36]. The potential is\nV (\u03b3) =\nm20\n4\u03c0\n\u3008\u039b+, \u03b3\u2020\u039b\u2212\u03b3\u3009 , (6.2)\nwhere m20 is a bare overall mass scale, \u3008 , \u3009 is the Killing form of g, and \u039b\u00b1 = i\u03bb\u00b1 \u00b7 h\nare two arbitrary elements in the Cartan subalgebra of g associated with the maximal\ntorus H , specified by two rg-dimensional vectors \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212. In this context, SHSG is a\nLagrangian action defined on 1+1 Minkowski space. (In contrast, eq. (2.2) defines the\nmodel as a perturbed conformal field theory in two-dimensional Euclidean space with\nrole of the potential V (\u03b3) being taken by the perturbing operator \u00b5 \u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb.) The field \u03b3\nin (6.1) has dim(G) = (hg+1)rg degrees of freedom. However, SHSG is invariant under a\ngroup of abelian gauge transformations generated by H . This built-in gauge symmetry\nremoves rg degrees of freedom, and SHSG is actually defined on the coset manifold G\/H\nof dimension rghg. The positive integer k is known as the \u2018level\u2019 [37]. Classically, it plays\nthe role of an inverse coupling constant, and both the weak-coupling (perturbative) and\nsemiclassical regimes are recovered when k is large. kSgWZW provides an action for the\nGk\/U(1)\nrg coset conformal field theory, and the potential is a composite field that can\nbe identified with a (gauge invariant) matrix element of the WZW field \u03b3 taken in the\n30\nadjoint representation [17]. This is the spinless relevant primary field that defines the\nperturbation, and the resulting theory is massive for any choice of \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 such that\n\u03bb\u00b1 \u00b7\u03b1 6= 0 for all roots \u03b1 of g; for these cases quantum integrability was checked in [2].\nWithout loss of generality, \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 can be restricted to live in the same Weyl\nchamber [1], which ensures that V (\u03b3) has a minimum at \u03b3 = 1I 10. In the following,\nwe shall assume that the simple roots have been chosen so that this chamber is the\nfundamental Weyl chamber. Then, \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 specify the classical masses and resonance\nparameters of the solitons associated with the positive roots \u03b2 via the formulae [3, 9]\nM2\u03b2 = m\n2\n0(\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03bb+)(\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03bb\u2212) and \u03c3\u03b2 =\n1\n2\nln\n\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03bb+\n\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03bb\u2212 , (6.3)\nand, up to the overall bare mass scale, M2\u03b2 coincides with (2.6). These equations can be\nsolved for \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 as functions of mi =M\u03b1i\/m0 and \u03c3i = \u03c3\u03b1i to recover (2.5). When\nsubstituted in (6.2), this provides the following decomposition of the potential:\nV (\u03b3) =\nm20\n4\u03c0\nrg\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u00b52ij \u0393ij(\u03b3) , (6.4)\nwhere\n\u00b52ij = mi mj e\n\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3j and \u0393ij(\u03b3) = \u2212\n\u2329\n(\u03bbi \u00b7 h) , \u03b3\u2020 (\u03bbj \u00b7 h) \u03b3\n\u232a\n. (6.5)\nThis shows that the potential depends on the rghg gauge-invariant degrees of freedom\nof the fundamental field \u03b3 through the r2g composite fields \u0393ij(\u03b3). All the dependence\non the parameters {mi, \u03c3i} is concentrated in the real positive coupling constants \u00b5ij .\nNotice that mij , as defined in (3.8), is equal to max(\u00b5ij, \u00b5ji). Recall also that the parity\nsymmetry of the unperturbed gauged WZW theory is implemented by the simultaneous\ntransformations x\u2192 \u2212x, \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u2020. Since \u0393ij(\u03b3\u2020) = \u0393ji(\u03b3), the condition for this symmetry\nto be respected by the perturbation is \u00b5ij = \u00b5ji. The composite fields \u0393ij(\u03b3) are inde-\npendent of the parameters and, since the group G is compact, their size is bounded and\ncan be taken to be of order one. Eq. (6.4) provides an explicit realisation of the general\nparametrisation of the perturbing operator given in (2.1), as\nV (\u03b3) =\nm20\n4\u03c0\nrg\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u00b52ij \u0393ij(\u03b3) \u2261 \u00b5\nrg\u2211\np,q=1\n\u03bbp\u03bbq \u03c6\nadj, adj\np , q = \u00b5 \u03c6\u03bb,\u03bb . (6.6)\nNoticing that \u00b52ij = (\u03bb+ \u00b7\u03b1i)(\u03bb\u2212 \u00b7\u03b1j), this shows that the two vectors \u03bb and \u03bb correspond\nto \u03bb+ and \u03bb\u2212 in the semiclassical limit.\nThe decomposition (6.4) provides a simple physical explanation for the pattern of\ncrossover effects observed in the TBA analysis. All of the coupling constants (m20\/4\u03c0) \u00b5\n2\nij\nhave the dimension of a squared mass scale. Therefore, along the RG trajectory corre-\nsponding to the action (6.1), they are relatively small in the UV region, and large in the\nIR. In massive theories with just one coupling constant, of the type most often discussed\n10The group of gauge transformations can be taken to be of axial form, i.e., \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1 with \u03b1 =\n\u03b1(t, x) taking values in H , which makes the minimum of the potential at \u03b3 = 1I unique, modulo gauge\ntransformations.\n31\nin the perturbed conformal field theory literature, there is only one independent mass\nscale and the passage from the UV to the IR involves just one transition. In contrast, for\nthe HSG theories, the various mass scales (m20\/4\u03c0) \u00b5\n2\nij can be given very different values\nby varying the parameters {mi, \u03c3i}. As the RG scale passes any of these scales, a new\ntransition may potentially occur; from the Lagrangian point of view, this underlies the\nobserved staircase trajectories.\nHowever, when the scale associated with a given coupling is reached, it could be that\nall fields involved in the corresponding interaction have already decoupled. To avoid this\nissue in our initial discussion, suppose that the values of the parameters are such that one\ncoefficient, say \u00b5ij, is much larger than all of the others. One way to achieve this is to\nchoose the parameters\nmk = e\na\u03b4k,i , \u03c3k = 0, \u2200 k = 1 . . . rg (6.7)\nfor i = j, or\nmk = 1 , \u03c3k = a\n(\n\u03b4k,i \u2212 \u03b4k,j\n)\n, \u2200 k = 1 . . . rg (6.8)\nfor i 6= j , with a\u226b 0 in both cases. Then, starting from the UV where all couplings are\neffectively zero and all fields effectively massless, at the squared mass scale (m20\/4\u03c0) \u00b5\n2\nij ,\nonly \u00b5ij has become effectively nonzero. This coupling governs the separation between the\nUV and the IR regions for all configurations of the field \u03b3 such that \u0393ij(\u03b3) is non-trivial;\ni.e., for those \u03b3 such that \u0393ij(\u03b3) 6\u2248 \u0393ij(1I), where \u03b3 = 1I is the absolute minimum of the\npotential. Defining a dimensionless RG scale \u039b =\n\u221a\n4pi\nm0\n\u039b, the effect of \u0393ij(\u03b3) is negligible\nfor \u039b \u226b \u00b5ij, and only those field configurations such that \u0393ij(\u03b3) \u2248 \u0393ij(1I) remain in the\neffective theory for \u039b \u226a \u00b5ij. Since \u00b5ij was assumed to be larger than all of the other\ncoefficients, it is in particular larger than \u00b5ji, and so \u00b5ij = mij and this crossover happens\nat one of the classical mass scales.\nTo solve the condition \u0393ij(\u03b3) \u2248 \u0393ij(1I), we first recall that every element \u03b3 of a compact\nconnected Lie group lies in a one-parameter subgroup, so that \u03b3 = expX for some X \u2208 g.\nIntroducing a Cartan-Weyl basis for the complexification of g, consisting of a Cartan\nsubalgebra {h1 . . . hrg} and step generators E\u03b1 , X is of the general form\nX = it \u00b7 h+\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\n(\u03c6\u03b1E\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217\u03b1E\u2212\u03b1) = \u2212X\u2020 , (6.9)\nwhere t is real, and the \u03c6\u03b1 are complex. Then\n\u0393ij(expX)\u2212 \u0393ij(1I) = \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u22652\n1\nn!\n\u2329\n(adX)n(\u03bbi \u00b7 h) , \u03bbj \u00b7 h\n\u232a\n=\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\n(\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03bbi)(\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03bbj) \u3008E\u03b1, E\u2212\u03b1\u3009 |\u03c6\u03b1|2 \u2212\n\u2211\nn\u22653\n1\nn!\n\u2329\n(adX)n(\u03bbi \u00b7 h) , \u03bbj \u00b7 h\n\u232a\n.(6.10)\nAt the level of the quadratic (leading) term, the condition \u0393ij(\u03b3) = \u0393ij(1I) is therefore\nsolved by restricting the sum in (6.9) to the roots \u03b1 of g that satisfy (\u03b1 \u00b7\u03bbi)(\u03b1 \u00b7\u03bbj) = 0,\nand this gives the possible flat (effectively massless) directions away from the identity.\nNotice that the condition to quadratic order is symmetrical in i and j: the flat directions\nfor \u0393ij and \u0393ji coincide at the identity.\n32\nHowever, to match the non-perturbative TBA results, the full vacuum manifold for\nthe effective theory should be mapped out. In order to do this, we first recall the notation\nintroduced just after (4.48): g[i1,...,in] denotes the Dynkin diagram obtained by deleting\nthe nodes i1 . . . in from the Dynkin diagram of g, and G\n[i1,...,in] the compact subgroup of\nG associated with g[i1,...,in] times a U(1)n factor associated with those nodes. We shall\nalso use the superscript [i1,...,in] to indicate that a field configuration takes values in this\ngroup. With this notation in place, we show that \u0393ij(\u03b3) is invariant under the action of\nG\n[j]\nL \u00d7G[i]R , by which we mean that\n\u0393ij(\u03c6\n[j] \u03b3 \u03c8[i]) = \u0393ij(\u03b3), \u2200\u03c6[j] \u2208 G[j] and \u03c8[i] \u2208 G[i]. (6.11)\nThis follows from the fact that, if \u03c8 = expX with X of the form (6.9), then\n\u03c8(\u03bbi \u00b7 h)\u03c8\u2020 = \u03bbi \u00b7 h\u2212\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\n(\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03bbi)\n\u2211\nn\u22651\n1\nn!\n(adX)n\u22121(\u03c6\u03b1E\u03b1+ \u03c6\u2217\u03b1E\u2212\u03b1) . (6.12)\nIf \u03c8 = \u03c8[i] \u2208 G[i], the sum (6.9) for the corresponding X is restricted to the roots \u03b1\nof g such that \u03b1 \u00b7 \u03bbi = 0, and so \u03c8[i](\u03bbi \u00b7 h)\u03c8[i]\u2020 = \u03bbi \u00b7 h. Similarly, if \u03c6[j] \u2208 G[j] then\n\u03c6[j]\n\u2020\n(\u03bbj \u00b7h)\u03c6[j] = \u03bbj \u00b7h. Combining these two facts is enough to prove (6.11), and to show,\nin particular, that \u0393ij(\u03c6\n[j] 1I\u03c8[i]) = \u0393ij(1I). Adding the already-performed identification of\nthe flat directions at the identity, the final conclusion is that the configurations connected\nto the identity which satisfy \u0393ij(\u03b3) = \u0393ij(1I) live in the submanifold of G\nG[j] \u00b7G[i] = {\u03c6[j] \u03c8[i] |\u03c6[j] \u2208 G[j], \u03c8[i] \u2208 G[i]}. (6.13)\nThese fields participate in the effective theory in the regime \u00b5ij \u226b \u039b \u226b \u00b5pq in situations\nwhere \u00b5ij \u226b \u00b5pq for all (p, q) 6= (i, j). Near to the identity they correspond to the\neffectively massless fluctuations, and are symmetrical in i and j. However, it is important\nto appreciate that the full manifolds of effective field configurations left unfrozen by \u0393ij\nand \u0393ji can be different, reflecting the breaking of parity, even though this asymmetry\nnever shows up in the quadratic approximation to (6.10).\nThis characterisation of the effective theory provides useful information about the\nfixed point visited by the RG flow after the first crossover has occurred. This fixed point\nis associated with the gauged WZW action in (6.1), SgWZW, restricted to the manifold\nG[j] \u00b7G[i], whose conformal field theory interpretation will be investigated in the following\nparagraphs.\nWe start with the case when i = j. Then, the manifold of effective field configurations\nis G[i] \u00b7 G[i] = G[i], which is a subgroup of G that splits into a product of simple groups\nassociated with the (possibly disconnected) Dynkin diagram g[i], times a U(1) factor.\nRecall that the HSG model was originally defined not on G, but on the coset manifold\nG\/H , where H \u2243 U(1)rg is a maximal torus of G. Therefore, the fixed point is specified\nby the restriction of SgWZW to the manifold G\n[i]\/H , which is in agreement with the\nTBA results presented just after (4.48). Since, by construction, the U(1) factor in G[i] is\ncontained in H , the restriction of the gauged WZW action to G[i]\/H splits into a number\nof decoupled parafermionic theories, one for each simple factor in G[i], and all of them at\nlevel k.\nThe case with i 6= j is more involved. We start by characterising the manifold of\neffective field configurations G[j] \u00b7 G[i] as a coset manifold. First, we note that there is\n33\nan obvious map from G[j] \u00d7 G[i] into G[j] \u00b7 G[i] given by (\u03c6[j], \u03c8[i]) \u2192 \u03c6[j]\u03c8[i]. However\nthis is not one-to-one, since \u03c6[j]\u03c8[i] is invariant under \u03c6[j] \u2192 \u03c6[j]\u03c1\u22121 and \u03c8[i] \u2192 \u03c1\u03c8[i], for\nany \u03c1 \u2208 G[i,j] = G[j] \u2229 G[i], and so this action should be factored out. This provides the\nfollowing coset realisation of the manifold of effective field configurations:\nG[j] \u00b7G[i] \u2243 G\n[j] \u00d7G[i]\nG[i,j]\n, (6.14)\nwhere the action of G[i,j] on G[j] \u00d7 G[i] is (\u03c6[j], \u03c8[i]) \u2192 (\u03c6[j]\u03c1\u22121, \u03c1\u03c8[i]), for any \u03c1 \u2208 G[i.j].\nParenthetically, we point out that this coset is a particular example of those considered\nby Guadagnini et al. in [38] (see also [39]), which is one of the first papers dealing with\nN\/D coset models where different left and right actions of D on N are gauged: the so-\ncalled \u2018asymmetric cosets\u2019. Models of this type, and their generalisations, are examples\nof \u2018heterotic\u2019 conformal field theories and have been of some interest in string theory; in\naddition to the papers just mentioned, refs. [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45] give a sample of work\nin this direction.\nHowever, in our case, not all the field configurations \u03b3 \u2208 G[j] \u00b7 G[i] are physical. The\nactions SgWZW and SHSG in (6.1) are invariant under a group of abelian gauge transfor-\nmations generated by a maximal torus H \u2243 U(1)rg of G, and they are therefore defined\non G\/H . The precise form of the gauge group is \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03c4\u0302(\u03b1\u22121), A\u00b1 \u2192 \u03b1(A\u00b1 + \u2202\u00b1)\u03b1\u22121,\nwhich is parametrised by the lift \u03c4\u0302 of a suitable orthogonal O(rg) transformation \u03c4 acting\non the Cartan subalgebra into H [1, 2].11 Taking all of this into account, the full manifold\nof physical effective field configurations left unfrozen by \u0393ij can be identified with the\ncoset\nG[j] \u00d7G[i]\nG[i,j] \u00d7H \u2243\nG[j] \u00d7G[i]\nG[i,j] \u00d7 U(1)rg , (6.15)\nwhere the action of G[i,j] \u00d7H on G[j] \u00d7G[i] is(\n\u03c6[j], \u03c8[i]\n)\u2192 (\u03b1 \u03c6[j] \u03c1\u22121, \u03c1 \u03c8[i] \u03c4\u0302(\u03b1\u22121))\n=\n(\n\u03b1, \u03c1\n) (\n\u03c6[j] , \u03c8[i]\n) (\n\u03c1\u22121, \u03c4\u0302(\u03b1\u22121)\n)\n, \u2200 \u03c1 \u2208 G[i,j] and \u03b1 \u2208 H . (6.16)\nNext, consider the gaugedWZW action corresponding to the coset (6.15) and the (anomaly\nfree) group of gauge transformations h\u2192 \u01ebL(u) h \u01ebR(u\u22121), where h = (\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 G[j] \u00d7G[i],\nu = (\u03c1, \u03b1) \u2208 G[i,j] \u00d7H , and \u01ebL\/R : G[i,j] \u00d7H \u2192 G[j] \u00d7G[i] are two group homomorphisms\ndefined by\n\u01ebL(\u03c1, \u03b1) = (\u03b1, \u03c1) and \u01ebL(\u03c1, \u03b1) =\n(\n\u03c1, \u03c4\u0302 (\u03b1)\n)\n, (6.17)\nwhich descend to embeddings of the corresponding Lie algebras. The action is given\nby [39, 40, 35] (see also [2] for the normalisation)\nkS\n[i,j]\ngWZW[h,A\u00b1] = kS [i,j]WZW[h] +\nk\n\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2x\n(\n\u2212\u3008\u01ebL(A+), \u2202\u2212hh\u22121\u3009\n+\u3008\u01ebR(A\u2212), h\u22121\u2202+h\u3009+ \u3008h\u22121\u01ebL(A+)h, \u01ebR(A\u2212)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u01ebL(A+), \u01ebL(A\u2212)\u3009\n)\n,(6.18)\nwhere kS\n[i,j]\nWZW[h] is the WZW action at level k for the field h in G\n[j] \u00d7 G[i], and A\u00b1 =\n(a\u00b1, A\u00b1) are non-dynamical gauge fields taking values in the Lie algebra of G[i,j] \u00d7 H .\n11In particular, taking \u03c4 = +I or \u2212I leads to gauge transformations of vector or axial type, respectively.\n34\nMore precisely, a\u00b1 \u2208 g[i,j] \u2295 u(1)2 and A\u00b1 \u2208 u(1)rg , where all the explicit u(1) factors\nare embedded in the Cartan subalgebra into H , and we have denoted by g[i,j] both the\nDynkin diagram defined just after (4.48) and the corresponding (compact semisimple) Lie\nalgebra. We have also used the same notation for the invariant bilinear form of g and its\ntrivial extension to\n(\ng[i,j] \u2295 u(1)2)\u2295 u(1)rg :\n\u3008(u, v), (r, s)\u3009 \u2261 \u3008u, r\u3009+ \u3008v, s\u3009 . (6.19)\nWriting h = (\u03c6, \u03c8) and expanding (6.18), we obtain\nkS\n[i,j]\ngWZW[h,A\u00b1] = kSWZW[\u03c6] + kSWZW[\u03c8]\n+\nk\n\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2x\n(\n\u2212\u3008a+, \u2202\u2212\u03c8\u03c8\u22121\u3009+ \u3008a\u2212, \u03c6\u22121\u2202+\u03c6\u3009+ \u3008a+, \u03c8\u03c4(A\u2212)\u03c8\u22121\u3009\n+\u3008a\u2212, \u03c6\u22121A+\u03c6\u3009 \u2212 \u3008a+, a\u2212\u3009\n\u2212\u3008A+, \u2202\u2212\u03c6\u03c6\u22121\u3009+ \u3008\u03c4(A\u2212), \u03c8\u22121\u2202+\u03c8\u3009 \u2212 \u3008A+, A\u2212\u3009\n)\n, (6.20)\nwhere kSWZW is the WZW action at level k corresponding to the groupG. The dependence\nof this action on the non-dynamical gauge fields a\u00b1 is very simple, allowing them to be\nintegrated out by solving their equations of motion. The result is\nkS\u02dc\n[i,j]\ngWZW[h,A\u00b1] = kSWZW[\u03c6] + kSWZW[\u03c8]\u2212\nk\n\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2x \u3008\u03c6\u22121\u2202+\u03c6, \u2202\u2212\u03c8\u03c8\u22121\u3009\n+\nk\n\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2x\n(\n\u2212\u3008A+, \u2202\u2212(\u03c6\u03c8)(\u03c6\u03c8)\u22121\u3009+ \u3008\u03c4(A\u2212), (\u03c6\u03c8)\u22121\u2202+(\u03c6\u03c8)\u3009\n+\u3008(\u03c6\u03c8)\u22121A+(\u03c6\u03c8), \u03c4(A\u2212)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008A+, A\u2212\u3009\n)\n. (6.21)\nFinally, using the Polyakov-Wiegmann formula\nkSWZW[\u03c6\u03c8] = kSWZW[\u03c6] + kSWZW[\u03c8]\u2212 k\n\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2x \u3008\u03c6\u22121\u2202+\u03c6, \u2202\u2212\u03c8\u03c8\u22121\u3009 , (6.22)\nit is straightforward to check that kS\u02dc\n[i,j]\ngWZW[h,A\u00b1] coincides with the gauged WZW action\nin (6.1), SgWZW[\u03b3, A\u00b1], for \u03b3 = \u03c6 \u03c8 .\nTherefore, for i 6= j, the fixed point visited by the RG flow after the first crossover\nhas occurred corresponds to the gauged WZW action of the \u2018asymmetric coset\u2019 (6.15),\nwhere different left and right actions of G[i,j] \u00d7 H on G[j] \u00d7 G[i], specified by the two\ngroup homomorphisms (6.17), are gauged. This means that the holomorphic and anti-\nholomorphic sectors of the resulting effective field theory correspond to different cosets\nsharing the same central charge [39, 40, 35]. Taking the form of \u01ebL\/R into account, the\nleft and right cosets can be written as\nG\n[j]\nk\nU(1)rg\n\u00d7 G\n[i]\nk\nG\n[i,j]\nk\nand\nG\n[j]\nk\nG\n[i,j]\nk\n\u00d7 G\n[i]\nk\nU(1)rg\n, (6.23)\nwhich are uniquely defined by the inclusion of g[i,j] into g[j] and g[i], respectively. In\nretrospect, this result is not surprising: the HSG models generically break parity, and\n35\nthis can make the relationship between the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors in\nany intermediate-scale conformal field theories non-trivial. Our discussion has made this\nexplicit by showing that, for i 6= j, and \u00b5ij \u226b \u00b5pq \u2200(p, q) 6= (i, j), the fixed point visited\nby the RG flow after the first crossover has occurred corresponds to a \u2018heterotic\u2019 conformal\nfield theory where parity is broken, unless the two cosets in (6.23) are isomorphic.\ng = A t\ni\nB t\nj\nC\nD E\ng[j]i = A t\ni\nB\nD\ng[i]j = B t\nj\nC\nE\ng[i\u2229j] = B\nFigure 9: The generic form of the Dynkin diagrams of g, g[j]i , g[i]j , and g[i\u2229j] defined just before\neq. (6.24). The boxes A,B,C,D,E stand for Dynkin subdiagrams connected to either node \u2018i\u2019\nor \u2018j\u2019. Some of these boxes can be empty. In particular, B is empty if i and j are neighbouring\nnodes.\nAlthough the notation used in (6.23) looks simple, it can be misleading because the\nsubgroups G[j], G[i], and G[i,j] may split into products of simple groups and U(1) factors,\nyielding common factors in the numerators and denominators that can be cancelled out.\nThis prompts us to write the cosets in a more detailed way, to clarify their structure. We\nstart by introducing the following notation: let g[i]j be the connected component of the\nDynkin diagram g[i] containing the node j, r[i]j be the rank of g[i]j , and g[i\u2229j] = g[i]j \u2229 g[j]i.\nCorrespondingly, let G[i]j , G[j]i, and G[i\u2229j] denote the simple compact Lie groups whose\nDynkin diagrams are g[i]j , g[j]i, and g[i\u2229j], respectively. Taking into account the form of\nthe Dynkin diagram of g, which is sketched in figure 9 in a non-standard but convenient\nway for our purposes, it is easy to prove that any field configuration of the form \u03b3 = \u03c6[j]\u03c8[i]\ncan always be written as the product of a element in G[j]i \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[j]i times an element\nin G[i]j \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[i]j , where U(1)rg\u2212r[j]i and U(1)rg\u2212r[i]j are subsets of H ; i.e.,\nG[j] \u00b7G[i] = {\u03c6[j]\u03c8[i]} = {\u03c6\u02dc[j]i \u03c8\u02dc[i]j} = (G[j]i \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[j]i) \u00b7 (G[i]j \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[i]j ) . (6.24)\nAs a direct consequence of this,\n\u0393ij(\u03b3) = \u0393ij(1I)\u21d2 \u0393kl(\u03b3) = \u0393kl(1I) \u2200 k \/\u2208 g[i]j and l \/\u2208 g[j]i . (6.25)\nThis ensures that, once the crossover at the scale \u00b5ij has taken place, no further crossovers\nwill be observed at \u00b5kl for any k \/\u2208 g[i]j and l \/\u2208 g[j]i, and provides the Lagrangian version\nof the shielding mechanism.\nNotice that \u03c6\u02dc[j]i \u03c8\u02dc[i]j is invariant under \u03c6\u02dc[j]i \u2192 \u03c6\u02dc[j]i\u03c1 and \u03c8\u02dc[i]j \u2192 \u03c1\u22121\u03c8\u02dc[i]j for any \u03c1 \u2208\nG[i\u2229j]\u00d7U(1)rg\u2212r[i\u2229j], where r[i\u2229j] = r[i]j + r[j]i\u2212 rg is the rank of g[i\u2229j]. Then, repeating the\n36\narguments used in the previous paragraphs, the cosets (6.23) that specify the holomorphic\nand anti-holomorphic sectors of the effective field theory can be written as\n(G[j]i)k\nU(1)r\n[j]i\n\u00d7 (G\n[i]j)k\n(G[i\u2229j])k \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[j]i\nand\n(G[j]i)k\n(G[i\u2229j])k \u00d7 U(1)rg\u2212r[i]j\n\u00d7 (G\n[i]j)k\nU(1)r\n[i]j\n, (6.26)\nand these cosets are uniquely defined by the inclusions g[i\u2229j] \u2282 g[i]j and g[i\u2229j] \u2282 g[j]i. When\ni and j are neighbours on the Dynkin diagram of g , the box B in figure 9 is empty, G[i\u2229j] is\ntrivial, and the conjectured effective field theory consists of two decoupled parafermionic\ntheories specified by the cosets (G[i]j)k\/U(1)\nr[i]j and (G[j]i)k\/U(1)\nr[j]i . This particular\ndecoupling could have been anticipated from the structure of the two-particle scattering\namplitudes that define the Gk\/U(1)\nrg HSG model, given by (4.4). In the limit |\u03c3ij| \u2192 \u221e,\nthey split into the amplitudes corresponding to the direct sum of the (G[i]j)k\/U(1)\nr[i]j and\n(G[j]i)k\/U(1)\nr[j]i HSG models, provided we restrict ourselves to rapidity values |\u03b8| \u226a |\u03c3ij |.\nEq. (6.26) also shows that whenever {i, j} are not neighbours on the Dynkin diagram of\ng, the effective field theory involves a coset CFT that is not of parafermionic type.\nThe predictions obtained using the explicit formulation of the HSG models in terms of\ngauged WZW models can be checked against the TBA results. The TBA equations can\nalso be used to find candidates for the effective field theory, as explained in appendix A. As\na manifestation of parity breaking, the TBA equations (4.7) are not always symmetrical\nunder \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8 and, consequently, they generically lead to different \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019\ncandidates that share the same central charge. In the cases that we have analysed,\nthis matches the results obtained using the gauged WZW formulation, where different\ncosets specify the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors of the conformal field theory\ncorresponding to the fixed point visited.\nMore quantitative tests are provided by the central charges of the fixed points visited\nby the RG flow, which can be calculated as in section 4. Consider a set of TBA parameters\nchosen as in (6.7) or (6.8), so that one scale, mij , is larger than all the others. Then\n2r\u22121 \u226b mij corresponds to the deep UV limit, where c(r) \u2248 Ck(g), and increasing the\nvalue of r through the first crossover, we get to the regime where mpq \u226a 2r\n\u22121 \u226a mij ,\nfor all (p, q) 6= (i, j). The effective value of c(r) is specified by g\u02dc\u00b1l (r, {mi}, {\u03c3ij}), which\nare the subsets of the Dynkin diagram of g defined just before eq. (4.30). Taking into\naccount that for this range of values of r the pseudoenergies \u03b5ia are effectively independent\nof the pseudoenergies \u03b5jb, the Dynkin diagram g\u02dc\n\u00b1\nl satisfies the following relations:\ni) if i \u2208 g\u02dc\u00b1l , then j 6\u2208 g\u02dc\u00b1l , g\u02dc\u00b1l = g\u02dc[j]\n\u00b1\nl , and g\u02dc\n[i]\n\u00b1\nl = g\u02dc\n[i,j]\n\u00b1\nl ,\nii) if j \u2208 g\u02dc\u00b1l , then i 6\u2208 g\u02dc\u00b1l , g\u02dc\u00b1l = g\u02dc[i]\n\u00b1\nl , and g\u02dc\n[j]\n\u00b1\nl = g\u02dc\n[i,j]\n\u00b1\nl ,\niii) if i, j 6\u2208 g\u02dc\u00b1l , then g\u02dc\u00b1l = g\u02dc[i]\n\u00b1\nl = g\u02dc\n[j]\n\u00b1\nl = g\u02dc\n[i,j]\n\u00b1\nl , (6.27)\nfor all l = 1 . . . rg. Therefore, using (4.26), (4.28), and (4.34), the TBA equations lead to\nthe behaviour\nc(r) \u2248\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3Ck\n(\ng\n)\n, for 2r\u22121 \u226b mij ,\nCk\n(\ng[i]\n)\n+ Ck\n(\ng[j]\n)\u2212 Ck(g[i,j]) , for mpq \u226a 2r\u22121 \u226a mij , \u2200 {p, q} 6= {i, j},\n(6.28)\n37\nwhere Ck\n(\ng\n)\nhas been defined in (4.33) for g \u2208 a, d, e with rank rg; it denotes the central\ncharge of the Gk\/U(1)\nrg coset conformal field theory. For g disconnected, it is the sum of\n(4.33) over all connected components of g. Notice that Ck\n(\ng[i]\n)\n+ Ck\n(\ng[j]\n) \u2212 Ck(g[i,j]) is\nthe central charge of the conformal field theory specified by the cosets (6.23). Therefore,\nif we identify the Lagrangian parameters {mi, \u03c3i} with the TBA parameters such that\nmij = \u00b5ij, and the dimensionless RG scale \u039b with 2r\n\u22121, the behaviour predicted using\nthe gauged WZW formulation matches the plateau value of c calculated from the TBA.\nEq. (6.28) resembles a decoupling rule suggested in [46] to describe the behaviour of\nthe models in the \u03c3ij \u2192\u221e limit. However, the embeddings necessary to define the cosets\nwere not discussed in that paper, and in particular the possible left-right asymmetry of\nthe relevant theories was missed.\nSo far in this section we have restricted ourselves to cases when one coefficient, say\n\u00b5ij, is larger than all of the others, and we have discussed the fixed point visited by\nthe RG flow just after the crossover associated with \u00b5ij has occurred. More generally,\nin this formalism, crossovers are associated with the decoupling of field configurations\nthat become effectively heavy at a given RG scale. The relevant mass scales are just the\nclassical masses (2.6), since, using (6.10), they determine the (quadratic) leading term of\nthe potential\nV (expX) =\nm20\n4\u03c0\nrg\u2211\ni,j=1\n\u00b52ij \u0393ij(expX) =\nm20\n4\u03c0\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+\nm2\u03b1 \u3008E\u03b1, E\u2212\u03b1\u3009 |\u03c6\u03b1|2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (6.29)\nConsequently, the resulting pattern of crossover scales is the same as deduced in section 3,\nand we will not discuss it again here. Instead, we shall briefly discuss the identification\nof the fixed points visited by the RG flow corresponding to the plateaux observed in the\neffective central charge c(r). According to the results in sections 3 and 4, a plateau will\noccur whenever, for particular values of the parameters, the dimensionless mass scales\n{m\u03b1, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+} split into two well-separated sets Elight and Eheavy, with m\u03b1 \u226a m\u03b2 for any\nm\u03b1 \u2208 Elight and m\u03b2 \u2208 Eheavy. The plateau occurs for RG scales between these two sets,\nm\u03b1 \u226a \u039b \u226a m\u03b2 \u2200 m\u03b1 \u2208 Elight and m\u03b2 \u2208 Eheavy , (6.30)\nand the corresponding fixed point is expected to be specified by the field configurations\nwhich are left unfrozen by the components of the potential associated with Eheavy. This\nis, by the field configurations that satisfy the conditions\n\u0393ij(\u03b3) = \u0393ij(1I) \u2200 (i, j) such that \u00b5ij \u223c m\u03b1 with m\u03b1 \u2208 Eheavy . (6.31)\nThe general solution of these conditions and their detailed comparison with the TBA\nresults deserve further study, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\nIn the following, we will just illustrate their use in a concrete example. Consider the\nsame d4 \u2261 SO(8) case studied in section 3, corresponding to the parameters in (3.15).\nThe scales \u00b5ij = mij are ordered as follows\n\u00b514 \u226b \u00b524 \u226b \u00b513 \u226b \u00b534 \u226b \u00b523 \u226b \u00b512 \u226b \u00b511 = \u00b522 = \u00b533 = \u00b544 , (6.32)\nand the relationship between the classical mass scales m\u03b1 and the coefficients \u00b5ij can\nbe worked out from (3.16) and (3.17). Consider first the regime \u039b \u226b m14 = \u00b514. This\n38\ncorresponds to the deep UV limit, where all the field configurations are effectively massless,\nthe potential can be completely neglected, and the effective field theory is described by\nthe unperturbed SO(8)k\/U(1)\n4 coset conformal field theory.\nNotice that the coefficient \u00b514 is larger than all of the others, which means that the\neffective theory after the first crossover has occurred is determined by left and right cosets\nof the form (6.26). To be concrete, for the range of energies m24 = \u00b524 \u226a \u039b \u226a m14 only\nthe field configurations that satisfy \u039314(\u03b3) = \u039314(1I) remain effectively massless, which\nare of the form \u03b3 = \u03c6[4] \u03c8[1]. In this case, the Dynkin diagrams g[1]4 and g[4]1 defined\njust before (6.24) are the a3 Dynkin subdiagrams associated to the nodes {2, 3, 4} and\n{1, 2, 3}, respectively, while g[1\u22294] is the a2 subdiagram corresponding to {2, 3}. Then, the\ntwo cosets (6.26) coincide with\nSU(4)k\nSU(3)k \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\n. (6.33)\nTaking (3.17) into account, in this regime all the field configurations associated with the\nroots \u03b11 +\u03b12 +\u03b14, \u03b11 +\u03b12 +\u03b13 +\u03b14, and \u03b11 + 2\u03b12 +\u03b13 +\u03b14 are decoupled.\nNext, we consider the energy scales m13 = \u00b513 \u226a \u039b \u226a m24, where all the field\nconfigurations associated with the roots \u03b12 + \u03b14 and \u03b13 + \u03b12 + \u03b14 become decoupled\ntoo. According to (6.31), the corresponding fixed point is determined by the simultaneous\nsolutions to \u039314(\u03b3) = \u039314(1I) and \u039324(\u03b3) = \u039324(1I). Remarkably, taking (6.25) into account,\nthe condition \u039324(\u03b3) = \u039324(1I) already implies \u039314(\u03b3) = \u039314(1I) and \u039334(\u03b3) = \u039334(1I), which\nhas two direct consequences. First, the effective theory in this regime is specified by left\nand right cosets of the form (6.26) with i = 2 and j = 4, which in our case read\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\n\u00d7 SU(2)k\nU(1)\n, (6.34)\nand correspond to two decoupled parafermionic theories.\nThe second consequence is that there is no crossover at the scale m34 = \u00b534, exactly\nas predicted by our analysis of shielding in section 3. Therefore, the next regime is\nm23 = \u00b523 \u226a \u039b \u226a m13, where all the field configurations associated with the root\n\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13 become decoupled. In this case, the fixed point is determined by the solutions\nto \u039324(\u03b3) = \u039324(1I) and \u039313(\u03b3) = \u039313(1I), which are of the form \u03b3 = \u03c6\n[3,4]\u03c8[1,4]\u03c9[1,2,3]. Using\nsimilar arguments to those that lead to (6.31), the corresponding manifold of effective field\nconfigurations can be realised as a coset manifold in terms of G[3,4]\u00d7G[1,4]\u00d7G[1,2,3]. Since\ng[1,2,3,4] is trivial, G[1,2,3,4] = H and one has to take into account the invariance of \u03b3 under\n\u03c6[3,4] \u2192 \u03c6[3,4]\u03c1, \u03c8[1,4] \u2192 \u03c1\u22121 \u03c8[1,4]\u03b2, and \u03c9[1,2,3] \u2192 \u03b2\u22121\u03c9[1,2,3] for each \u03c1 \u2208 G[1,3,4] and\n\u03b2 \u2208 H , which leads to the identification of the fixed point as a coset conformal field\ntheory associated with\nSU(3)k\nSU(2)k \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7\nSU(3)k\nU(1)2\n\u00d7 SU(2)k\nU(1)\n. (6.35)\nIn this particular case, the left and right cosets coincide.\nWe can keep considering smaller and smaller energy scales until we reach the deep IR\nlimit \u039b \u226a mii for all i = 1 . . . 4, where all the field configurations are decoupled.

(6.36)\nStrictly speaking, the Lagrangian action (6.1) should only be expected to give a full\ndescription of the theory in the semiclassical (large k) limit. However, the resulting\nvalues of the effective central charge reproduce the approximate values calculated using\nthe TBA equations for any value of k. In particular, in (6.36), the superscripts < >\nprovide the central charges of the corresponding coset conformal field theories for level\nk = 2. They match the TBA results illustrated in figure 8, despite the fact that this value\nof the level is far from the semiclassical regime. The same occurs for the other examples\ndiscussed along the paper.\n7 Comments on form factor calculations\nThere is another context where crossover phenomena can be seen, namely the be-\nhaviour of correlation functions. It is natural to ask whether, and to what extent, the\nresults we have obtained from a study of finite-size effects can be reproduced. In inte-\ngrable theories, this can be addressed using the form-factor approach, which provides an\ninfrared series expansion for correlation functions that typically has good convergence\nproperties down to short distances. The method was first applied to the HSG models\nassociated with SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121 for N = 3 in [6, 7], and for N \u2265 4 in [8]. However,\nwhile crossover effects for unstable particles of height 2 were observed in [7, 8], no tran-\nsitions associated with roots of height greater than 2 were found. This is as expected for\nthe SU(3)2\/U(1)\n2 case of [7] since SU(3) has no roots of height greater than 2 anyway,\nbut it is more puzzling for the cases discussed in [8]. Indeed, the plot shown in [8] for\nSU(4)2\/U(1)\n3 with \u03c312 = 50 and \u03c323 = 20 should qualitatively match the corresponding\nflow presented in [10, 11] and in figure 4 above, while in fact even the number of steps is\ndifferent. Similarly, the plotted SU(5)2\/U(1)\n4 flows in [8] do not match our predictions.\nThese discrepancies between form-factor and finite-size results were first remarked in [10]\n(see [11]), and for these particular instances they were later traced [46] to a misattribution\nin the signs of the resonance parameters as originally given in [8] \u2013 so, for example, the\nSU(4) plot is actually for \u03c312 = 50 and \u03c323 = \u221220. Using our terminology, the scale m13\nis then shielded by m12 and this resolves the immediate mismatch. However, it remains\nthe case that crossovers associated with roots of heights greater than 2 have yet to seen\n40\nusing the form-factor approach. In this section we shall argue that the reasons for this\nrun, at least in part, deeper than a simple question of the correct allocation of the signs of\nthe resonance parameters in the form factors, and that they have a bearing on a claimed\nslow-down in the convergence of the form factor approach for the HSG models.\nThe investigation of HSG RG flows in [7, 8] was based on the numerical evaluation\nof Zamolodchikov\u2019s c-function [47] using Cardy\u2019s sum rule [48], expanding the relevant\ntwo-point functions of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of n-particle\nform factors. In practice, such calculations must always be truncated at some point.\nUsually, while this affects the accuracy of results to some \u2013 albeit small [49] \u2013 extent, no\nimportant information is lost provided one calculates at least as far as the two-particle\ncontributions. However, as we now show, in theories with unstable particles there are good\nreasons to predict that the effects of early truncation can be more dramatic, sometimes\nobscuring physically-relevant crossovers, and sometimes leading to misleading values for\nthe ultraviolet central charge.\nForm factors are matrix elements of some local operator O between a multiparticle\nin-state and the vacuum. They can be written as\nFO|\u00b51...\u00b5nn (\u03b81, . . . , \u03b8n) = \u30080 | O(0, 0) | V\u00b51(\u03b81) . . . V\u00b5n(\u03b8n)\u3009in , (7.1)\nwhere the symbol V\u00b5(\u03b8) represents a particle of species \u00b5 and rapidity \u03b8. Two-point\nfunctions can then be obtained by inserting a complete set of asymptotic states between\nthe two operators involved, resulting in a sum over (integrated) one-, two- and higher-\nparticle contributions. Only stable particles appear directly in the asymptotic states, and\nso this raises the question of how and in what way the form-factor expansion can be\ninfluenced by the existence of any unstable particles. Taking the particle interpretation\nas a guiding principle, we conjecture that two conditions must be met for the nth-order\nterm associated with the form factor (7.1) to be sensitive to an unstable state \u00b5\u02dcR. The\nfirst condition is that it must be possible to form \u00b5\u02dcR as a bound state of some subset\n{\u00b5i1 . . . \u00b5im} of the particles {\u00b51 . . . \u00b5n}; the second, apparently trivial but as we shall\nsee important, is that F\nO|\u00b51...\u00b5n\nn should not be identically zero. Notice that the second\ncondition will often require that n be strictly larger than m.\nAll HSG form factor calculations to date have been performed for level k = 2, and\nfor simplicity we restrict to such cases here too. Then the quantum number a of single-\nparticle states (i, a) is always equal to 1 and can be dropped, while i labels a simple root\n\u03b1i of g. The remaining, unstable, particles are similarly indexed by the positive roots\n\u03b2 =\n\u2211\nni\u03b1i of height \u2265 2. The condition that it be possible to form the unstable particle\n\u03b2 from some subset of the set {\u03b1i1 . . .\u03b1in} of stable particles is that it should contain n1\ntimes \u03b11, n2 times \u03b12, and so on.\nThe second condition, the non-vanishing of the relevant form factors, can be partially\nanalysed using a spin-zero conserved charge. As in the unperturbed theory of level-k\nG-parafermions [13], the HSG theory associated with the coset Gk\/U(1)\nrg possesses a\ndiscrete conserved charge taking values in \u039bg modulo k\u00d7\u039bg, where \u039bg is the root lattice\nof g. This generalises the Zk charge of the usual parafermions, which is recovered for\nG = SU(2). Stable particles correspond to states of definite charge, and the particle (i, a)\ncarries the charge a\u03b1i [3]. Taking this into account, a necessary condition to ensure that\na given form factor is non-vanishing is that the total charge of the multiparticle state\nmatches the charge of the local operator O. In the particular case of neutral operators\n41\nsuch as the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, \u0398, this implies that the form factor\nassociated with a multiparticle state (i1, a1)....(in, an) will vanish unless\nn\u2211\nj=1\naj\u03b1ij \u2208 k \u00d7 \u039bg (7.2)\nTherefore, for k = 2, the only form factors of neutral operators that can be non-vanishing\nare those corresponding to multiparticle states where each simple root appears an even\nnumber of times. For \u0398, this general rule is in agreement with the results of [6,8].\nConsider now the calculation of Zamolodchikov\u2019s c-function for the HSG theories at\nk = 2. This requires the two-point function of \u0398, and hence the form factors F\n\u0398|\u03b1i1 ...\u03b1in\nn .\nCombining our two conditions, we conclude that the effects of unstable resonance states\nassociated with the roots \u03b2 of height ht(\u03b2) will only be seen in the nth-order term in the\nform factor expansion if n \u2265 2 ht(\u03b2). Since the numerical calculations of [8] went up to\n6-particle form factor contributions, this means that they are not expected to be sensitive\nto unstable particles associated with roots of height larger that 3.\nAll of this leads to the following predictions. For SU(4)2\/U(1)\n3, the calculation of\nZamolodchikov c-function for the values of the resonance parameters originally quoted\nin [8], using the form factor expansion up to the 6th-order term, should qualitatively\nmatch the dotted line in figure 4 and detect the crossover transition at the scale fixed by\nm\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13 . In contrast, for SU(5)2\/U(1)\n4, it should only find the transitions associated\nwith the scales m\u03b11+\u03b12+\u03b13 and m\u03b12+\u03b13+\u03b14 , but no crossover transition associated with\nthe maximal root alone, which in this case is of height 4. In general, for SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121\nthe maximal number of crossovers that can be observed when truncating the form factor\nseries at the 6-particle contribution is 3(N\u22122), the number of roots of height \u2264 3, while\nthe maximal number of separable scales quoted in table 1 for g = aN\u22121 is N(N\u22121)\/2.\nHence for N \u2265 5 there will always be choices of the parameters for which some crossovers\nare missed completely, if the form factor expansion is not pushed further.\nOn the other hand, if the parameters are chosen such that no new physical crossover\nscales are associated with roots of height greater than two, so that all crossovers are\nalready noticed by the low-lying roots, then another, more subtle, effect comes into play \u2013\nwhile a crossover will be seen at the appropriate energy scale, the change in the effective\ncentral charge will be wrong, as not all relevant states will have been taken into account.\nRecall that the pattern of crossovers observed in the HSG models can be viewed as a\nconsequence of the change in the number of field configurations that remain effectively\nmassless at the RG scale, both stable and unstable. According to our analysis, a similar,\nbut not identical, effect is at work in the form factor expansion: truncating the series\nat a certain number of particles will suppress the contribution of some unstable particle\nstates, which would otherwise have been seen once the energy scale became large enough.\nIf we try to calculate the effective central charge in the far ultraviolet, then this effect is\nsure to show up, no matter what values are chosen for the S-matrix parameters. As will\nnow be shown, this idea can be checked quantatively against previously-published data.\nThe central charge of the unperturbed theory can be recovered by integrating the\nderivative of Zamolodchikov\u2019s c-function not just up to some finite scale, but all the way\nto the far ultraviolet. Using the form factor approach, this leads to a series\ncUV =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n\u2206c(n) (7.3)\n42\nfor the UV central charge, where \u2206c(n) is the n-particle form factor contribution. This\ntypically has excellent convergence properties, for which there are good analytic argu-\nments [49]. However, in [8] this general understanding was called into question: a study\nof the truncations of the form factor series for the SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121 HSG models up to\n6 particles led to the suggestion that convergence was becoming slower and slower for\nincreasing values of N . The proposed decoupling of unstable particle states from form\nfactors involving a small number of particles allows an alternative understanding of the\ndata presented in [8]: it is not that the calculated central charge is becoming more inac-\ncurate, it is just that it is no longer measuring the UV central charge of the full theory,\nbut rather that of a subtheory in which certain particle states are decoupled. This phe-\nnomenon should be general to all theories with unstable particles, and we predict that\nonce sufficiently-many terms have been included in the form factor expansion that no\nunstable particle contributions are artificially excluded, the good convergence properties\nargued for in [49] will be restored.\nFor SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121, this idea can be tested against the numerical results of [8] for\nthe would-be UV central charge. Let c\n(m)\nUV \u2261\n\u2211m\nn=1\u2206c\n(n) denote the UV central charge\ncomputed from the series (7.3) truncated at the m-particle contribution. The prediction\nsuggested by our analysis is that, for m < 2(N\u22121), c(m)UV should not approximate the\nUV central charge of the full theory, but rather that of the effective theory obtained by\ndecoupling all unstable particles associated with the roots of height larger that m\/2. In\ncontrast, once m \u2265 2(N\u22121), the value of c(m)UV should converge in the usual manner to the\nvalue of cUV , which is C2(aN\u22121) in the notation of (4.33).\nWe start by quoting the individual n-particle form factor contributions to the value\nof cUV for SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121, as given in [8]:\n\u2206c(2) = (N \u2212 1)\u00d7 0.5 ,\n\u2206c(4) = (N \u2212 2)\u00d7 0.197 ,\n\u2206c(6) = (N \u2212 2)\u00d7 0.002 + (N \u2212 3)\u00d7 0.0924 . (7.4)\nSubstituted into the expansion, these lead to\nc\n(2)\nUV = (N \u2212 1)\u00d7 0.5 ,\nc\n(4)\nUV = N \u00d7 0.697\u2212 0.894 ,\nc\n(6)\nUV = N \u00d7 0.7914\u2212 1.1752 . (7.5)\nOur claim is that these numbers should approximate the ultraviolet central charges of\nthe effective theories obtained by decoupling all the unstable particles associated with the\nroots of height larger than \u03c7, where \u03c7 = 1, 2, 3 for c\n(2)\nUV , c\n(4)\nUV and c\n(6)\nUV respectively. For\nthe SU(N)2\/U(1)\nN\u22121 theories, there is an alternative way to realise the required effective\ntheories, by choosing the S-matrix parameters as follows\nmi = 1 and \u03c3i = i\u03c3 \u2200 i = 1, . . . , N \u2212 1 \u21d2 mij = e |i\u2212j|\u03c3 , (7.6)\nwith \u03c3 \u226b 0 , and examining the theory at scales e (\u03c7\u22121) \u03c3\/2 \u226a 2r\u22121 \u226a e \u03c7 \u03c3\/2, where\nall the field configurations associated with the roots of height larger than \u03c7 have been\ndecoupled. Using the TBA analysis given earlier, for the parameters (7.6) the effective\n43\ncentral charge c(r) has N \u2212 1 plateaux as r varies from 0 to \u221e, matching the successive\ndecoupling of roots of heights N \u2212 1, N\u22122, . . . , 1:\nc(r) \u2248\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\ncUV , for 2r\n\u22121 \u226b e (N\u22122) \u03c3\/2 ,\nc\u03c7 , for e\n(\u03c7\u22121) \u03c3\/2 \u226a 2r\u22121 \u226a e \u03c7 \u03c3\/2 , \u03c7 = 1 . . .N \u2212 2 ,\n0 , for 2r\u22121 \u226a 1.\n(7.7)\nThe plateau central charges c\u03c7 can then be calculated using the results of section 4. The\nresult is\nc\u03c7 = (N \u2212 \u03c7) C2(a\u03c7)\u2212 (N \u2212 \u03c7\u2212 1) C2(a\u03c7\u22121) , \u03c7 = 1 . . .N \u2212 1 , (7.8)\nwhere cN\u22121 = cUV , and we have used C2(a0) = 0. For \u03c7 = 1, 2, 3, this gives\nc1 = (N \u2212 1)\u00d7 1\n2\n, c2 = N \u00d7 7\n10\n\u2212 9\n10\n, c3 = N \u00d7 4\n5\n\u2212 6\n5\n. (7.9)\nComparing with (7.5), we see that while the difference between c\n(6)\nUV and cUV = C2(aN\u22121)\nbecomes larger and larger with increasing values of N , with a relative error that reaches\nup to 20% , c\n(2\u03c7)\nUV approximates c\u03c7 with a relative error of less than 1% for any value of\nN . This offers strong support for our contention that the problems previously observed\nin form-factor results for the HSG models are not due to any general degrading of the\nconvergence properties of the series, but rather to a controlled decoupling of states which\ncould, in principle, be remedied by adding a finite number of further terms.

We have restricted our attention to simply-laced G, but we expect\nthat similar results will hold for the non simply-laced cases too. For suitable values of\nthe parameters, the finite-size scaling function c(r) undergoes a series of well-separated\n44\ncrossovers. The positions of these crossovers allowed us to identify scales associated with\nboth stable and unstable quantum particles, and to show that they match semiclassical\ndata, even far from that regime. Although only well-separated scales can be seen in this\nway, our results provide non-perturbative support for the idea that all of the semiclassical\nparticles, both stable and unstable, survive in the quantum theory, for any value of k.\nThe crossovers corresponding to unstable particles associated with roots of height\nlarger than two have yet to be observed in calculations based on the form factor ap-\nproach [8]. While this lack is partially explained by the particular values of the parameters\nchosen for the computations performed to date [46], we pointed out that truncation ef-\nfects in the form factor series should be particularly important in the presence of unstable\nparticles, and proposed that this should lie behind previously-observed losses in accuracy\nin such calculations.\nOur results imply the existence of a great variety of \u2018staircase\u2019 renormalisation group\nflows which, starting from the UV, pass close to a finite number of other fixed points before\nreaching their ultimate destinations. The multiparameter nature of the HSG models\nmeans that their flows in fact sweep out whole manifolds of integrability in the space\nof theories, and the staircases can be understood as lying near the boundaries of these\nmanifolds. We have provided general rules to find the central charges of the fixed points\nvisited by these flows, by calculating the plateau values of c(r). We have also established\nthe maximal number of steps for each model; owing to the shielding phenomenon, for\nthe d and e algebras this number is less than might have been expected. It would be\ninteresting to classify the different ways to realise the maximal number of steps, and more\ngenerally to find a more group-theoretical interpretation of the patterns of successive\nsymmetry-breakings revealed by the TBA analysis.\nAt the crossovers, the models are described by a set of effective TBA systems that\nextends the class of massless TBAs discussed in [25, 26, 27], enabling the HSG models\nto unify these simpler flows within a common structure. This relationship can be used\nto deduce a Lagrangian formulation for some of these massless TBA systems from the\nformulation of the HSG models in terms of perturbed gauged WZW actions. Another\ninteresting aspect of the HSG TBA staircase patterns is that the plateau values of the\nscaling function correspond to certain exact multiple scaling limits. The relationship\nbetween these limits and quantum group reduction merits further study, perhaps making\nuse of ideas discussed in [50].\nA final question, partially addressed in this paper, is the precise identification of the\nconformal field theories visited by the RG flows. We have investigated this using the TBA\nequations and the Lagrangian formulation, both of which lead to natural candidates for the\nrelevant fixed points. In many cases these are heterotic conformal field theories [39, 40, 41].\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the issue of RG flows to and from\nsuch conformal field theories has been raised12, and it clearly deserves further work. As\nsuggested in more general terms in [11], the full spectrum of excited states should provide\nimportant information in this regard, and a study of this using the TBA techniques\ndeveloped in [52, 53] would be worthwhile.\n12But note, marginal heterotic deformations are discussed in, for example, [45], while a perturbation\nwith more extreme left-right asymmetry, for which even the perturbing dimensions on left and right differ,\nis treated in [51].\n45\nAcknowledgments\nWe would both like to thank Pascal Baseilhac, Peter Bowcock, Aldo Delfino, Terry\nGannon, Werner Hoffmann, Angel Paredes, Volker Schomerus, Roberto Tateo and Jean-\nBernard Zuber for helpful discussions during the course of this project, and SPhT Saclay\nfor hospitality in its final stages.

At\nvarious points in this paper we have specified fixed points not by their central charges,\nbut rather by giving candidate coset conformal field theories. In this appendix we review\nbriefly how such candidates can be found directly from the structure of the TBA equations,\nand explain why they should be treated with particular caution for the HSG models.\nThe basic procedure is simple. In section 4.3, the plateau central charge was evaluated\nas a sum over the left and right active energy terms of contributions c\u00b1p =\n1\n2\n(Ck(g\n\u00b1\np ) \u2212\nCk(g\u0302\n\u00b1\np )). The first step is to identify 2c\n\u00b1\np with the central charge of the coset conformal\nfield theory (\nG\u00b1p\n)\nk(\nG\u0302\u00b1p\n)\nk\n\u00d7 U(1)\n, (A.1)\nwhere G\u00b1p and G\u0302\n\u00b1\np are the compact subgroups of G specified by the Dynkin diagrams\ng\u00b1p and g\u0302\n\u00b1\np , respectively. By construction, G\n\u00b1\np is simple, and G\u0302\n\u00b1\np semisimple. These\ncosets are uniquely defined by the (regular) embeddings of G\u0302\u00b1p into G\n\u00b1\np provided by the\ninclusion g\u0302\u00b1p \u2282 g\u00b1p , and the identification of the U(1) factor with the one-dimensional\nsubgroup generated by the Cartan element associated with the fundamental weight \u03bbp.\nA candidate for the conformal field theory of the plateau is then obtained by tensoring\nall these terms, (\nG\u00b11\n)\nk(\nG\u0302\u00b11\n)\nk\n\u00d7 U(1)\n\u00d7\n(\nG\u00b12\n)\nk(\nG\u0302\u00b12\n)\nk\n\u00d7 U(1)\n\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7\n(\nG\u00b1rg\n)\nk(\nG\u0302\u00b1rg\n)\nk\n\u00d7 U(1)\n, (A.2)\nand reducing the resulting expression by means of the cancellation of those simple factors\nthat appear associated with the same nodes of the Dynkin diagram of g both in the\nnumerator and the denominator.\nTo see the procedure in action, consider the plateau whose effective TBA equations\nare summarised by figure 6a. The {c\u2212p } contributions lead to the following \u2018left\u2019 coset\ncandidate:\nSU(2)\n{1}\nk\nU(1){1}\n\u00d7 SU(3)\n{1,2}\nk\nSU(2)\n{1}\nk \u00d7 U(1){2}\n\u00d7 SU(4)\n{1,2,3}\nk\nSU(3)\n{1,2}\nk \u00d7 U(1){3}\n, (A.3)\n46\nwhere we have introduced the notation G{i1...in} to indicate that this group is associated\nwith the nodes i1 . . . in of the Dynkin diagram of g. After the cancellation of the common\nterms of numerator and denominator, this coset simplifies to\nSU(4)\n{1,2,3}\nk\nU(1){1} \u00d7 U(1){2} \u00d7 U(1){3} \u2261\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\n. (A.4)\nSimilarly, the {c+p } contributions lead to the \u2018right\u2019 coset candidate\nSU(2)\n{1}\nk\nU(1){1}\n\u00d7 SU(4)\n{1,2,3}\nk\nSU(2)\n{1}\nk \u00d7 U(1){2} \u00d7 SU(2){3}k\n\u00d7 SU(2)\n{3}\nk\nU(1){3}\n, (A.5)\nwhich, after the cancellations, also leads to SU(4)k\/U(1)\n3. Notice that the cancellation\nperformed in (A.3) and (A.5) takes place only between simple factors associated with the\nsame nodes of the Dynkin diagram of g.\nIn this first example, the left and right candidates coincide, which should be expected\nsince the effective TBA equations represented by figure 6a correspond to the deep UV\nlimit of the SU(4)k\/U(1)\n3 HSG model. This correspondence provides an a posteriori\njustification for the cancellations leading from (A.3) and (A.5) to the coset SU(4)k\/U(1)\n3.\n(4)\n(2)\n\u221240 200\u221220 40\n(1)\n(3)\nFigure 10: Effective TBA systems with asymmetric candidate cosets.\nHowever, since the individual contributions c+p and c\n\u2212\np are different in general, they\noften lead to different left and right candidates. This will be illustrated by our second\nexample. Consider the effective TBA equations summarised by figure 10. In this case,\nsome of the Dynkin diagrams {g\u00b1p } coincide, namely g+2 = g+3 = g+4 , g\u22121 = g\u22122 , g\u22123 = g\u22124 ,\nand the general rules to calculate the plateau central charge have to be modified as\ndescribed in section 4.4, so that the separate contributions {c+1 . . . c+4 } and {c\u22121 . . . c\u22124 } to\nthe total effective central charge are replaced by {c+1 , c+2+3+4} and {c\u22121+2, c\u22123+4}, respectively\n(see eq. (4.39)). Then, the value of, say, c\u00b1p1+...+pn is calculated as for the generic case, the\nonly difference being that the diagram g\u0302\u00b1p1 is now found by deleting all the nodes p1 . . . pn\nfrom g\u00b1p1, instead of just p1. Correspondingly, in our construction, 2c\n\u00b1\np1+...+pn is identified\nwith the central charge of the coset conformal field theory(\nG\u00b1p1\n)\nk(\nG\u0302\u00b1p1\n)\nk\n\u00d7 U(1)n\n, (A.6)\nwhich generalises (A.1). The {c\u2212p } contributions lead to the coset candidate\nSU(3)\n{1,2}\nk\nU(1){1} \u00d7 U(1){2} \u00d7\nSU(4)\n{2,3,4}\nk\nSU(2)\n{2}\nk \u00d7 U(1){3} \u00d7 U(1){4}\n\u2261 SU(3)k\nU(1)2\n\u00d7 SU(4)k\nSU(2)k \u00d7 U(1)2 , (A.7)\n47\nwhile the candidate suggested by {c+p } is\nSU(3)\n{1,2}\nk\nSU(2)\n{2}\nk \u00d7 U(1){1}\n\u00d7 SU(4)\n{2,3,4}\nk\nU(1){2} \u00d7 U(1){3} \u00d7 U(1){4} \u2261\nSU(3)k\nSU(2)k \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7\nSU(4)k\nU(1)3\n. (A.8)\nClearly, for this case, our prescription indeed leads to different left and right coset con-\nformal field theory candidates, although with the same central charge.\nSince the different left and right candidates are constructed by analysing the left\nand right active energy term contributions, it is natural to identify the resulting candi-\ndates with the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors of a conformal field theory. In\ncases where those candidates are different, one might predict that the corresponding fixed\npoint visited by the RG flow should be of heterotic type. In the particular case of (A.7)\nand (A.8), they would correspond to an asymmetric coset conformal field theory [39, 40]\nassociated with\nSU(3)k \u00d7 SU(4)k\nSU(2)k \u00d7 U(1)4 , (A.9)\nwhere (A.7) and (A.8) specify the different left and right actions of SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)4 on\nSU(3)\u00d7 SU(4).\nThis matches the Lagrangian calculations of section 6. The effective TBA equations\nrepresented by figure 10 correspond to the SU(4)k\/U(1)\n3 HSG model in the regime \u00b5pq \u226a\n2r\u22121 \u226a \u00b541 = \u00b531, \u2200(p, q) 6= (4, 1), (3, 1). According to (6.31), the effective theory is\nspecified by the field configurations of the form \u03b3 = \u03c6[1]\u03c8[3,4], which can always be written\nas \u03b3 = \u03c6\u02dc[1]\u03c8\u02dc[3]. The two candidates (A.7) and (A.8) then coincide with the cosets in (6.26)\nfor i = 3 and j = 1.\nWe finish this appendix by showing that, despite the fact that the left and right\ncandidates can be different, they always have equal central charges. This follows from the\ngeneral indentity\nrg\u2211\np=1\nc+p (r) =\nrg\u2211\np=1\nc\u2212p (r) , (A.10)\nwhich can be proved as follows. Eq.

(B.3)\nHere, p1 . . . pn are positive integers, g1 . . . gn are simple Lie algebras, and Ck\n(\ng\n)\nis the\ncentral charge of the Gk\/U(1)\nrg coset conformal field theory, given by (4.33). Above and\nbelow the arrows, we have indicated the mass scale associated with each crossover, say\nmij , and the value of \u2212 ln(m1r\/2) at r = 2\/mij . These results are in complete agreement\nwith the numerical data presented in fig. 11.\nThe coset identifications for the fixed points visited by the flow can be worked out as\nexplained in section 6 and appendix A, and provide several examples where the fixed point\nis a true asymmetric coset model. The first occurs in the regime m14 \u226a 2r\n\u22121 \u226a m25 ,\nand is determined by the solutions to \u039351(\u03b3) = \u039351(1I) and \u039352(\u03b3) = \u039352(1I). Taking (6.25)\ninto account, the second condition implies the first, so the effective theory is specified by\nleft and right cosets of the form (6.26) with i = 5 and j = 2, which in this case are\nSU(5)k\nU(1)4\n\u2297 SO(10)k\nSU(4)\u2297 U(1)2 and\nSU(5)k\nSU(4)k \u2297 U(1) \u2297\nSO(10)k\nU(1)5\n.
