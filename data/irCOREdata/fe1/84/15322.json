Our \nstudy was conducted on employees from four metal companies in the Netherlands. As HRM \npractices seem to influence employee commitment, we performed 89 interviews across all \nfour companies and included blue-collar workers, their managers (direct supervisors, HR \nmanagers and production managers), as well as works council members. To test our \nhypotheses on commitment differences, we conducted quantitative research within the \ncompanies (permanent employees N = 167; agency workers N = 54), all of who were blue-\ncollar workers. Results show that permanent employees and agency workers express similar \ndegrees of commitment to their job and to their co-workers, apart from affective commitment \nto co-workers, which is lower for agency workers than for permanent workers. We argue that \nnational legislation, as well as managers\u2018 attempts to offer HR practices equal to those of \npermanent staff, play a prominent role in stimulating agency workers\u2018 commitment.  \nEmployment status and commitment \n3 \nOn the job and co-worker commitment of agency workers and permanent employees   \nMuch has been written about the consequences of agency work for employees and \norganisations. Authors such as Pfeffer (1994) and Rousseau (1995) assume that, without a \npermanent labour contract, the development of employee commitment and other desirable \nattitudes is wishful thinking. As a result, they assume that non-permanent employees\u2018 work-\nrelated behaviour will suffer. However, research shows contradicting results: workers with a \nnon-permanent employment status can develop commitment comparable to those of \npermanent employees (e.g., Pearce 1993) and their commitment can even exceed that of the \nlatter (McDonald and Makin 2000). How can we explain these findings? A salient explanation \nis that there must be a \u2017black box\u2018 between the labour contract\/commitment link: other factors \nare obscuring a direct relationship. This paper focuses on one of these factors: HRM practices \n(e.g., Torka and Schyns 2007; Mitlacher 2008).  \n In this study, we concentrate on two commitment foci: the job and the co-workers. \nThere are four reasons for us focussing on less abstract foci than the entire organisation. First, \ncommitment can work upwards: proximate foci can influence abstract ones (e.g. Yoon, Baker \nand Ko 1994). Second, research shows that employees with lower hierarchical functions are \ncommitted foremost to their job (e.g. Gallie and White 1993), which is a fact of particular \nrelevance for the population we deal with in this article, namely, blue-collar workers. Third, \nresearch indicates that commitment towards the entire organisation does not necessarily \npredict work-related behaviour or performance (see the next paragraph). Finally, meta-\nanalyses found that time is needed to build up commitment to something as abstract as the \nentire organisation (e.g., Mathieu and Zajac 1990; Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch and \nTopolnytsky 2002). However, the organisational \u2017membership\u2018 of many agency workers is \nlimited and shorter than those of permanent staff.   \nEmployment status and commitment \n4 \nWe will begin by highlighting the relationships between HRM practices and \ncommitment. We will also elaborate on Dutch legislation for agency work since managers\u2018 \nfreedom in shaping organisational conditions for agency workers is restricted by labour law \nand collective agreements. After a discussion of the method of this study, we will present the \nfindings. Finally, we will draw conclusions concerning agency workers\u2018 commitment and \ncompanies\u2018 opportunities to manage non-permanent workers\u2018 attitudes and behaviour. \n \nExploring HR practices as antecedents of job and co-worker commitment \nMany authors assume that employee commitment towards the organisation ultimately \ncontributes to company performance (e.g., Beer, Spector, Lawrence, Quinn Mills and Walton \n1984). The interest in commitment displayed by scholars and practitioners is therefore not \nsurprising. However, research challenges this idea, showing that organisational commitment \nis unrelated to (e.g., Somers and Birnbaum 1998) or has very little influence on job \nperformance (e.g., Mathieu and Zajac 1990). Consequently, Benkhoff\u2018s (1997) and Becker, \nBillings, Eveleth and Gilbert\u2018s (1996) findings argue for using less abstract foci of \ncommitment: they found that supervisor commitment had a stronger influence on \nperformance than organisational commitment. Most research still focuses on affective \ncommitment towards the entire organisation. Consequently, knowledge about other natures \nand foci of commitment, such as the ones we explore in this article, is limited (Meyer et al. \n2002; but see, e.g., Felfe, Schmook, Schyns and Six 2008). In general, commitment can be \ndefined as \u2015a (mental) force that binds an individual to a course of action of relevance to one \nor more targets.\u2016 (Meyer and Herscovitch 2001, p. 302). Although Allen and Meyer (1990) \ndistinguish between three types of commitment - affective, normative and continuance \ncommitment - we limit our study to affective and normative commitment because research \nhas shown that these two types of commitment predominantly predict the behaviour desired \nEmployment status and commitment \n5 \nby companies (e.g. Meyer et al. 2002). Affective commitment refers to emotional attachment. \nNormative commitment involves moral obligations.  \n  Job commitment refers to the likelihood that an individual will continue working in a \nparticular job because he or she feels psychologically attached to it (Rusbult and Farrell 1983, \np. 430). Related constructs are job involvement and work involvement. According to Hackett, \nLapierre and Hausdorf (2001, p. 394), job involvement tends to be a function of how much \none\u2018s job can satisfy one\u2018s current needs. Work involvement reflects a normative belief about \nthe value of work in one\u2018s life. Job commitment is not concerned with either the satisfaction \nof individuals\u2018 needs through the job (job involvement) or the importance of work in one\u2018s \nlife (work involvement), but focuses on the question as to whether or not someone is attached \nto his\/her job and why. Therefore, compared to job involvement, job commitment is more \nspecific: it is concerned with the underlying nature of one\u2018s needs. An individual with high \naffective job commitment likes his\/her job; an individual with high normative job \ncommitment has certain norms and values towards the job, that is, he or she feels a moral \nobligation to perform well in a job.  \n Co-worker commitment refers to the likelihood that a worker feels psychologically \nattached to his\/her colleagues. Affective co-worker commitment refers to a worker liking his \ncolleagues and enjoying working with them. Normative co-worker commitment refers to \n\u2017collegiality\u2018, or, to put it differently, to the totality of internalized normative pressures to act \nin a way that meets co-workers\u2018 goals and interests (Wiener, 1982, p. 421).  \n  \nOrganisational conditions for commitment: HR practices \nWork experiences correlate significantly and positively with affective and normative \ncommitment to the organization (Meyer et al. 2002). Work experiences could be defined as \neverything the individual experiences in the work context. We can therefore link these \nEmployment status and commitment \n6 \nexperiences to HR practices. Not only job characteristics and pay (e.g. Morris, Lydka and \nO\u2018Creevy 1993), but also development, promotion and training opportunities (e.g. Benson \n2006), as well as opportunities to take part in decision-making (e.g. Lincoln and Kalleberg \n1985), influence commitment positively. Consequently, we assume that HR practices serve as \nantecedents for both affective and normative commitment. Not much research has been done \non the relationship between recruitment\/selection and commitment. However, when taking \ninto account the employment status, the dichotomy voluntary\/involuntary seems an important \npredictor of commitment (e.g. Feldman, Doerpinghaus and Turnley 1995; Krausz, Brandwein \nand Fox 1995):  Are the workers doing temp work because they have no other possibility and \nsee this as a stepping stone to get back into permanent work or did they chose this kind of \nemployment because they prefer to be temp workers (see Torka and Schyns 2007; see also De \nCuyper and De Witte 2008)?  \n  In spite of the evidence for HR practices as antecedents of commitment, we have to be \ncautious with our assumptions. The above-mentioned research is solely focused on \ncommitment towards the organisation. Several scholars point to the interference of potential \nmulti-level problems in commitment research. This means that antecedents, as well as \nconsequences of commitment, should be linked to appropriate commitment foci. For example, \nresearch shows that motivation has a significant positive relationship with occupational \ncommitment, but not with organisational commitment (Wallace 1997). Therefore, it seems \nreasonable to assume that different HR antecedents may also impact commitment foci \ndifferently.  \nOrganisational conditions for agency workers: HR practices \nIn contrast to regular workers, agency workers have to deal with two organisations: the temp \nagency and the user firm. This also means that agency workers have two suppliers of HR \npractices. Thus, two organisations share the responsibility for directing agency workers\u2018 \nEmployment status and commitment \n7 \ncommitment. Research shows that the user firms\u2018 HR practices can influence the commitment \ntowards the agency and vice versa (e.g. Connelly, Gallagher and Gilley 2007). Evidence \nsuggests that agency workers have less attractive HR practices than permanent employees \n(e.g. European Foundation 2001; McGovern, Smeaton and Hill 2004). The logical assumption \nthat agency workers\u2018 commitment and behaviour will suffer therefore seems plausible, as \norganisations seem to invest less into the drivers of agency workers\u2018 commitment. We need to \ntake into account, however, the freedom that agency and user firms have in offering HR \npractices to agency workers, as it is restricted by national legislation and collective \nagreements. \nDespite the fact that European social partners had already proposed a directive for the \nregulation of temporary work in Europe in 1982, the directive was never officially negotiated \nat the sectoral level (Arrowsmith 2006) until now, due to differences of opinion on equality \nand terms and conditions of employment. This means that regulations and, as a consequence, \nworking conditions for agency workers differ between European countries.  \n \nOrganisational conditions for agency workers: regulations in the Netherlands \nThe Netherlands are the second largest user of agency work in Europe (2.5% of the total \nworkforce, just behind the UK, with 4.5%; Eurociett 2007). On July 1\nst\n 1998, the Labour \nMarket Intermediaries Act (WAADI) came into force. The WAADI abolished the licensing \nsystem (i.e., previously, permission was needed for running a temp agency) and a number of \nrestrictions relating to placement, maximum duration (from a maximum of six months to an \nopen-ended duration), worker redeployment, and limitations in the ability of agencies to \nobstruct agency workers from entering into direct employment contracts with user firms and \nothers. Other rules remained, such as a prohibition on posting agency workers in user firms in \nwhich there was a strike, the dual responsibility of user firms and agencies for the payments \nEmployment status and commitment \n8 \nof social premiums and taxes, and, in contrast to, for example, the UK, an equal wages clause \nfor agency workers. Additionally, sectoral level agreements between the agency employer \norganisations (in particular, the Algemene Bond Uitzendondernemingen (ABU), the \nNederlandse Bond voor Bemiddelings- en Uitzendondernemingen (NBBU), and the \nVereniging Payroll Ondernemingen (VPO)) and the unions were written. In January 1999, the \nFlexibility and Security Act came into force. The Act views the legal position of temporary \nemployees as a standard labour contract between a temporary employee and the agency, and \nalso introduces participation rights for agency workers in the user firm (Arrowsmith 2006).  \n In contrast to other countries (e.g. France and Italy), there are no restrictions in the \nUK, Germany and the Netherlands concerning reasons for agency worker use. Restrictions in \nother countries comprise of, for example, using temporary workers only for work limited to \nspecific, non-permanent jobs that are not part of the firms usual work (e.g., Portugal and \nSpain) and for exceptional peaks of work (e.g., Belgium and Norway). This means, managers \nin the Netherlands are permitted to use agency workers for regular jobs and also during \nnormal levels of activity. Therefore, Dutch companies have the opportunity to offer agency \nworkers HR practices concerning job characteristics equal to those of permanent employees.   \n Furthermore, in contrast to other countries, there is no limit in the Netherlands on the \nduration of employing agency workers for the user company. In other countries, the limitation \nof the duration differs between eight (Greece) and twenty-four months (Portugal). This means \nthat Dutch companies have more degrees of freedom than companies in other countries when \nit comes to their staffing practices for agency workers (Arrowsmith, 2006).  \n In the Netherlands, agency workers\u2018 tenure plays an important role with respect to the \nquality of HR practices for several reasons. First, the collective agreements between agency \nwork employer associations and unions include provisions on training after a certain time \nperiod and a time-related remuneration scheme. Second, when an employee works 26 weeks \nEmployment status and commitment \n9 \nfor the same user company, that client has to pay the agency worker the same wage and \novertime rates as permanent employees in the company. Third, according to the Dutch law on \nworks councils, agency workers with a length of service that exceeds 26 weeks of work for \nthe same agency have a right to elect council members. After one year of service, they are \neligible for election. Agency workers with a length of service that exceeds 24 months of work \nfor the same user firm have a right to vote and are eligible for election on the user company\u2018s \nworks council. Thus, for Dutch agency workers, tenure influences HR practices positively. \nThe Dutch regulations, and more specifically, the possibility of an open-ended assignment at \nthe user firm or the use of agency work for the firms\u2018 usual work, as well as the consequences \nof the equal pay act and the access to training, make the development of commitment in \ntemporary workers that is comparable to permanent workers possible. We can therefore \nassume that the job commitment of agency workers will not differ from those of user firms\u2018 \npermanent employees: \nHypothesis 1: Agency workers\u2019 affective commitment towards the job is not different \nfrom those of permanent employees.  \nHypothesis 2: Agency workers\u2019 normative commitment towards the job is not different \nfrom those of permanent employees.  \n \nHowever, the link between HR practices and co-worker commitment needs to be explained \nfurther. We assume that agency workers and permanent workers will regard each other as \nmore equal when they are treated equally by the organisation. As mentioned before, Dutch \nlegislation makes this possible.  In particular, the opportunity for open-ended assignments can \nenhance the feeling of being real colleagues for both groups and increase the sense of \ncommitment to each other. We know from prior research that longer-term cooperation adds to \nEmployment status and commitment \n10 \nthe feeling of solidarity between co-workers (Koster 2005) and we assume this to be true for \ntemporary and permanent workers as well.  \nHypothesis 3: Agency workers\u2019 affective commitment towards co-workers is not \ndifferent from those of permanent employees.  \nHypothesis 4: Agency workers\u2019 normative commitment towards co-workers is not \ndifferent from those of permanent employees.  \n \nMethod \nCompany background \nCompany A and B produce recognisable final products. The companies share one HR \nmanager: he works sixteen hours a week for company A and sixteen hours a week for \ncompany B. Company A has 164 employees with a permanent contract. 88 of these \nemployees are low- to medium skilled fitters and welders. In addition, 78 so-called \u2017flexible \nworkers\u2018 were working for the company at the time of the research. These included agency \nworkers, fixed-term employees, and hired hands (i.e., workers\u2018 \u2017borrowed\u2018 from other \ncompanies). 62 of the 78 non-permanents worked in production. Company B employs 137 \npermanent staff. 52 of the 137 staff members work as fitters and welders. The company had \nalso hired 38 agency workers. 26 of the 38 were fitters and welders. Due to their seasonal \nproducts (summer vs. winter), company A and B have opposite peaks and troughs. In order to \ndeal with these fluctuations, the companies exchange permanent employees. Company C \nproduces a recognisable final product, but is also active in the process industry. 350 people \nwork for the company. 50 of the190 manufacturing workers are agency workers. The workers \nare low- to medium skilled. Company D develops and produces hydraulic systems. 198 of the \n450 employees work in manufacturing; 80 of the 198 manufacturing workers are flexible \nworkers. Formal vocational training in advance is not necessary, as the workers perform \nEmployment status and commitment \n11 \nsimple assembly work. We included only agency workers and permanent staff in the \nquantitative study, excluding other forms of \u2017flexible workers\u2018, such as employees with a \nfixed term contract. In the qualitative study, six employees with a fixed term contract \nparticipated. All of them used to be agency workers within the user firm. We conducted \ninterviews with them because they can provide us with information from an insider\u2018s \nperspective: outlining differences between agency workers and company employees based on \ntheir own experiences. \nQualitative study \nTo gain knowledge on HR practices, semi-structured interviews were conducted. We \ninterviewed fifty-four metalworkers (22 were permanent employees, 32 had a non-permanent \nemployment relationship, including agency workers and employees with a fixed-term \ncontract), twenty-one supervisors, three HR managers, six works council members, and four \nproduction managers. Dutch research had already shown that the commonly used instruments \nfor measuring commitment are not suitable for low-educated employees (Peeters and Meijer \n1995), so another aim of the interviews was to derive questionnaire items. For this purpose, \nwe asked the respondents two questions: What does commitment towards the job mean to \nyou? And, what does commitment towards other colleagues mean to you? To gain knowledge \non HR practices and possible differences between employees and agency workers, we asked \nthe interviewees several questions, where each question was related to one HR practice. We \nasked managers the following: \u2015Could you describe the workers\u2018 job (including physical work \nconditions, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, opportunities for training, \nparticipation in decision making, and satisfaction with pay and benefits) and do you believe \nthat the \u2026 (all the mentioned practices) of agency workers and permanent employees differ?\u2016 \nWe asked the same question to the workers themselves, asking them to elaborate on the HR \npractices as they perceive them, as well as on differences between company employees and \nEmployment status and commitment \n12 \nagency workers. Additionally, we asked the HR and production managers about their motives \nfor using agency workers.  \nQuantitative study \nWe conducted questionnaire research to test our hypotheses on the similarities in commitment \nbetween permanent and temporary workers. We designed instruments for affective and \nnormative commitment to the job and co-workers based on the workers\u2018 answers to the two \ncommitment questions in the interviews. Before distributing the questionnaire, we asked five \nworkers from company A to check the items on clarity. In company A and B, the first author \ndistributed and collected the questionnaire personally (i.e., walking the floor). In company C, \nthe researcher held a presentation on the research for every team (in total 11) and then \ndistributed the questionnaires. The company provided a box for the completed questionnaires. \nIn company D, the HR manager distributed the questionnaire through the supervisors and a \nreturn box was installed in the canteen.  In total, 221 blue-collar workers (167 permanent \nemployees and 54 agency workers) participated in the study (overall response rate: 47 per \ncent).  \nThe mean age for permanent employees was forty-one years; for agency workers, \nthirty-six years. The mean tenure at the user firm for agency workers with a permanent \ncontract with the agency was 2.22 years. For those with a fixed-term contract with the agency, \nit was 1.04 years, and for agency workers with a so-called phase A, 0.63 years. Phase A \napplies to the first 78 weeks of work for the agency: the employment contract with the agency \nends when the contract between agency and user firm ends. We treated agency workers as one \ngroup for two reasons. First, we had a limited number of respondents in the different contract \ngroups: 13 with a phase A contract, 22 with a fixed-term contract, and 16 with a permanent \ncontract with the agency. Second, we asked the respondents about their \u2017continuous\u2018 tenure: \nEmployment status and commitment \n13 \nthe length of their current assignment. Therefore, some of the participants may have a longer \ntenure overall, when the length of different assignments is added up.    \n \nResults qualitative study: HR practices for agency workers and permanent employees \ncompared \nStaffing \nBased on HR and production managers\u2018 answers, we can conclude that the companies use \nagency work for the following reasons: (1) to absorb fluctuations in demand, (2) to screen \npossible new employees, and (3) as a buffer for their permanent staff. The managers from \ncompanies A, B and D mentioned all three reasons. According to company C managers, \nreason one and three hold true, but the company does not have to deal with production peaks \nand troughs due to the long-term contracts with customers (between 10 and 15 years). In this \ncompany, short-term agency work is not possible because the product is very sensitive and \nsubject to (international) law. All staff in Company C has to be screened by the Dutch \nMilitary Intelligence and Security Service. This procedure takes two months. Company A and \nB have seasonal peaks and troughs: six months peak and six months troughs. The fluctuations \nin Company D are more unpredictable.  \n All companies also use temp agencies as a supply pool for potential permanent staff. \nBy using agency work, they can extend the legal probation period (one to two months). All \ncompanies strive to take over \u2017good\u2018 agency workers. In company C, the decision to take over \nagency workers takes up to three years, except for excellent agency workers. After three \nyears, three decisions are possible: those who perform badly have to leave; those who perform \naverage get a permanent contract with the agency; and those who perform particularly well \nreceive a permanent contract with the company.  \nEmployment status and commitment \n14 \n However, many agency workers prefer agency work over a traditional employment \nrelationship. As a matter of fact, company A and B offered several agency workers a \npermanent contract, but these agency workers refused because they like being temps. \nAccording to some of the agency workers, they do not want a permanent contract with the \ncompany because they like the idea that they can leave whenever they want to, and because \nthey like the fact that the agency would look for other assignments for them.  \n Finally, the buffer function of agency work in companies A, B and D has a particular \nhistory. Mass redundancies took place in the 1980s. The companies were forced to lay off a \nlarge percentage of their staff. This trauma, along with the negative reports of it in the media, \nis still remembered vividly by the managers. Therefore, even in times of low order volume, up \nto 40 per cent of the blue-collar workers have a non-permanent employment relationship. \nSome of the agency workers have worked for the same company for up to six years.  \n \nJob characteristics \nAccording to the HR and production managers, the agency workers perform the same tasks as \ntheir colleagues with a permanent contract after an initial trial period. In company D, due to \nthe unskilled, simple work, this period spans a few days to a few weeks. In the other \ncompanies, the period lasts up to several months for each manufacturing function. As \nmentioned before, only company D also uses short-term agency work (between a few days \nand a few weeks) and only these short-timers perform tasks of less quality than permanent \nstaff.  \n Workers from all four companies are in favour of this equality in job characteristics \nbetween agency workers and company staff after the trial period. According to the workers, it \nis even possible that the task content of the work of agency workers is more enriched \n(including more challenge and variety) than that of the companies\u2018 permanent staff. Good \nEmployment status and commitment \n15 \nexamples can be found in companies A and B. Some agency workers manufacture the whole \nfinal product, while some permanent employees \u2017only\u2018 fit product parts. In company C, some \nagency workers have functions on a higher hierarchical level than company employees. The \njob characteristics are an additional reason why some of the agency workers in company A \nhave rejected a permanent job offer. As mentioned before, company A and B exchange \nworkers and accepting a permanent contract would mean that they have to work for company \nB during A\u2018s troughs. According to company A\u2018s agency workers, the job characteristics in \ncompany B are less challenging, which was also a reason for refusing a permanent contract \nwith company A.  \n \nPhysical working conditions \nDifferences in the physical work conditions appear to exist in all companies. In company A, \nnew welders (all of them start as agency workers) do the so-called metre welding of vessels, \nthat is, the physically most demanding work. However, since all new employees start with \nthis task, differences are not a matter of contract, but of length of service. According to the \nmanagers, this is the only difference between agency workers and permanent staff. However, \nall workers mention more differences in physical work conditions. First, only short-term hired \nworkers have to weld galvanised steel. Second, permanent employees have a better \n(equipped) work cabin than short-term non-permanent workers. Third, since the agency \nworkers have to pay for their own working clothes, the state of their clothing is not as good as \npermanent employees, and this can lead to dangerous situations. Fourth, only employees with \na permanent, fixed-term contract and long-term agency workers receive customized earplugs \nfrom the (hiring) company.  \n In company C, agency workers do not perform more demanding or boring tasks than \ncompany employees. Agency workers receive working clothes and other protective materials \nEmployment status and commitment \n16 \nfrom the company for free. One visible difference exists between agency workers and \npermanent employees: permanent employees wear a white name badge and agency workers a \nyellow one. Several supervisors, employees, and agency workers mentioned this as an \n\u2017unpleasant\u2018 difference. In company D, only short-term agency workers (up to a few weeks) \nperform more boring and physically demanding work. Only the short-timers have to pay for \ntheir work clothes and protective materials. They do not wear clothing designed for the \ncompany and therefore are recognisable as agency workers.  \n \nSocial climate \nThe company staff and agency workers in all four companies state that they experience the \nsame treatment. The agency workers \u2017mix\u2018 with the companies\u2018 permanent staff during work \nand breaks. Some agency workers also meet their colleagues after hours. According to the \nagency workers, they receive the same friendly and respectful treatment from user firm \nsupervisors and the managers as company staff. When departments organise informal \nmeetings, agency workers are also invited. The supervisors and managers mention the \nimportance of treating flexible and permanent staff equally in order to keep motivation high \nand a willingness to return on another occasion. \n \nTraining (-on-the-job) and development  \nIn all four companies, agency workers mention that they receive the same opportunities for \ntraining-on-the-job through, for example, job enrichment and rotation, after the trial period. In \ncompany A, welders can switch to the fitting department and vice versa. In company B, \ncompany staff and agency workers assemble rather complex final products together. Thus, \nagency workers can learn the different steps necessary (including, for example, hydraulics, \npneumatics and electricity) from company staff. Company C has semi-autonomous teams. As \nEmployment status and commitment \n17 \nin company B, company staff is used for knowledge and skills transfer to agency workers. In \ncompany D, \u2017good\u2018 agency workers can also take part in the function rotation system. \nAccording to the HR manager, many permanent employees do not want to participate in \nfunction rotation and this has a positive impact on agency workers opportunities to receive \ntraining on the job.  \n All companies also finance training for long-term and\/or \u2017promising\u2018 agency workers. \nThese are the agency workers whom the managers would like to offer a company contract. In \ngeneral, the companies share training costs with the agencies and this co-financing sometimes \nleads to problems with the agencies, especially when courses are relatively expensive. \nCompany B paid for three agency workers, one of whom preferred remaining in agency work \nover a permanent company contract.  \n \nPay and benefits \nIn company A and B, former agency workers who are now employed by the company report \nthat they earned between 150 and 250 Euro less as agency workers, although they performed \nthe same functions. However, in both companies, some agency workers report that they earn \n200 Euro a month more than permanent staff. All of them are employed by agencies that are \nspecialised in posting skilled technical workers. In company A and B, agency workers, in \ncontrast to permanent staff, do not receive performance bonuses, or an end-of-year bonus (4 \nper cent of the gross salary), or a so-called CO2 bonus (for welders) and they cannot take out \nan insurance for glasses and dentures. Furthermore, agency workers only receive overtime \npay when they work more than 40 hours a week (permanent staff: more than 36 hours a \nweek). Agency workers with a short tenure (up to six months) have to pay for their own work \nclothes. In company C, agency workers receive the same salary as their colleagues with a \npermanent contract, as well as an end-of-year and middle-of-year bonus, but only permanent \nEmployment status and commitment \n18 \nstaff receives dividends. Concerning the salary, the manager urges the agency to pay the same \nsalary that permanent workers receive. For all staff, more than 8.5 hours of work a day is \nconsidered overtime and paid as such. Agency workers cannot take part in the collective \npension insurance and they do not receive 50 Euros for their birthday. The company, agency \nand the worker share costs for training. When the worker completes a course successfully, the \nuser firm pays the worker his\/her financial contribution back. Company D pays their \npermanent employees, as well as agency workers, a salary above the average of firms in the \nsame sector. The company has to do so to attract and retain (agency) workers. A few years \nago, after negative rumours had been spreading on the work floor regarding salaries, the HR \ndepartment and the works council did research on the salary of agency workers. They found \nthat other companies paid more. As a consequence, they increased the hourly salary. Contrary \nto the other companies, permanent employees in company D do not receive additional salary \n(dividends, end-of-year bonus, etc.).  \n  \nEmployee influence \nAll four companies have a works council. The works council members tried to interest long-\nterm agency workers in works council membership, but none of the agency workers \nresponded. The works council has a right of consent (Instemmingsrecht) - the most far-\nreaching right - on labour-related issues not regulated through a collective agreement. This \nmeans that the councils also (co-)decide on the use of flexible labour. Although works council \nmembers in company D question the amount of agency work, they, as well as council \nmembers in the other companies, support the use of agency work for the three reasons \nmentioned in the staffing section.  All interviewed workers mentioned that the works council \nis a good \u2017invention\u2018, but they did not know the responsibilities of the council. In all \ncompanies, team meetings take place on a regular basis (2 to 4 times a month). The agency \nEmployment status and commitment \n19 \nworkers usually participate and all managers state that they appreciate the agency workers\u2018 \ninvolvement. The managers see agency workers as having extensive knowledge from other \ncompanies that can be helpful. In company A, some agency workers participate in a quality \ncircle. The company is building a new welding department and the welders can co-decide on \nthe design.     \n \nResults: Quantitative study: Testing for equality of affective and normative commitment \ntowards the job and the co-workers \n \nPreliminary analyses \nPrior to testing our hypotheses, we conducted factor analyses in order to test for the \ndimensionality of our instruments. Appendix A and B depict the results of the factor analyses. \nThis step was necessary to ensure construct validity, as the instruments were newly \nestablished from our qualitative work. We subsequently conducted reliability analyses for all \ninstruments.  \nAffective and normative job commitment. The instruments for the assessment of \naffective and normative commitment to the job consisted of five and eight items, respectively. \nA factor analysis revealed a clear two-factor solution using the scree-plot criterion. All items \nloaded sufficiently on their respective factor (affective versus normative commitment). The \ninternal consistency for affective job commitment was \u03b1 = .75. The internal consistency for \nnormative job commitment was \u03b1 = .87. \nAffective and normative commitment to co-workers. The instruments for the \nassessment of affective and normative commitment to co-workers consisted of eight and five \nitems, respectively. A factor analysis revealed a clear two-factor solution using the scree-plot \ncriterion. One item from the normative commitment instrument had to be deleted due to a low \nEmployment status and commitment \n20 \nfactor loading. All other items loaded sufficiently on their respective factor (affective versus \nnormative commitment). The internal consistency for affective commitment to co-workers \nwas \u03b1 = .91. The internal consistency for the four remaining items assessing normative \ncommitment to co-workers was \u03b1 = .85. \n \nTest of hypotheses \nWe initially conducted four t-tests to test whether or not agency workers differ from \npermanent workers in their affective and normative commitment towards their work and their \nco-workers. \nAffective job commitment. The mean differences between permanent and agency \nworkers were very small for affective commitment towards the job (Mpermanent = 3.58; Magency \n= 3.59). The t-test did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups (t (206) = \n-0.08; n.s.). \nNormative job commitment. Again, the mean differences between permanent and \nagency workers were very small for normative commitment towards the job (Mpermanent = 4.47; \nMagency = 4.44). The t-test did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups (t \n(210) = 0.46; n.s.). \n Affective commitment to co-workers. The mean differences between permanent and \nagency workers were small but substantial for affective commitment to co-workers (Mpermanent \n= 3.66; Magency = 3.43). In this case, the t-test revealed a significant difference between the \ntwo groups (t (195) = 2.46; p < .05). We then checked whether or not the user firm tenure and \ndepartment tenure influenced affective commitment towards co-workers by means of a \nregression analysis. This turned out not to be the case. \nNormative commitment to co-workers. The mean differences between permanent and \nagency workers were very small for normative commitment to co-workers (Mpermanent = 4.31; \nEmployment status and commitment \n21 \nMagency = 4.33). The t-test did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups (t \n(216) = -0.18; n.s.). \n As t-tests test for differences and our hypotheses were expecting equality, we \nconducted equivalence tests to test for the equality of differences (Rogers, Howard and Vesey \n1993). The scales were transformed so that they had an absolute null-point, thus ranging form \nzero to four. The equivalence interval was defined as \u00b1 10% of the mean of the permanent \nworkers. \nAffective job commitment. The equivalence interval for affective commitment to job \nwas \u03b41 = 0.26 and \u03b42 = -0.26. Following Rogers et al. (1993), we computed z-values for each \n\u03b4, resulting in z1 = -2.39 (p < .01) and z2 = 2.22 (p < .05). Thus, our hypothesis was supported. \nNormative job commitment. The equivalence interval for normative commitment to \njob was \u03b41 = 0.35 and \u03b42 = -0.35. The z-values were z1 = -4.62 (p < .01) and z2 = 5.54 (p < \n.01). This supports our hypothesis. \nAffective commitment to co-workers. The equivalence interval for affective \ncommitment to co-workers was \u03b41 = 0.27 and \u03b42 = -0.27. The z-values were z1 = -0.45 (n.s.) \nand z2 = 5.36 (p < .01). Thus, our hypothesis was not supported for affective commitment to \nco-workers.  \nNormative commitment to co-workers. The equivalence interval for normative \ncommitment to colleagues was \u03b41 = 0.33 and \u03b42 = -0.33. The z-values were z1 = -4.27 (p < .01) \nand z2 = 3.90 (p < .01). This supports our hypothesis. \n \nGeneral discussion, limitations, and consequences \nThe aim of this paper was to explore the relationship between employment status (agency \nworkers vs. permanent staff) and affective and normative commitment towards the job and \nco-workers. We assumed on the basis of previous research that HR practices influence this \nEmployment status and commitment \n22 \nrelationship. Results show that agency workers\u2018 affective and normative commitment to the \njob and their normative commitment towards co-workers do not differ from their colleagues \nwith a permanent contract. Our qualitative research results show that agency workers perform \nthe same tasks as their permanent colleagues in all companies, at least after the agency \nworkers have completed an initial trial period. Furthermore, managers from all companies aim \nto minimize differences between permanent and non-permanent staff concerning other HR \npractices. This \u2017equality\u2018 may explain the lack of differences in agency and permanent \nworkers\u2018 commitment. However, with respect to pay and benefits, some differences seem to \nremain. For example, in company A and B, agency workers do not receive a substantial end-\nof-the-year bonus. Since these differences seem not to impact affective and normative job \ncommitment and normative colleague commitment, we assume that future research should \ntake more care of potential \u2017multi-level problems\u2018 when investigating antecedents and \nconsequences of commitment. This means, when certain antecedents are not significantly \nrelated to certain commitments, these antecedents can still have an impact on other \ncommitments.   \n Norms and values (normative job and co-worker commitment) hold up \u2017even\u2018 in non-\npermanent work-arrangements. This may especially hold true for those agency workers who \nexperience agency work as a \u2017stepping stone\u2018, namely, as an opportunity to gain a regular \nemployment relationship with the user firm. When agency workers meet norms and values \nexpected by the user firm they may be rewarded with a permanent contract.  \n We did find one significant difference between agency workers and permanent staff: \nthe former have less affective commitment towards their co-workers than the latter. \nRegression analysis showed that user firm and department tenure have no significant \ninfluence. One possible explanation for this finding could be that a sense of security is a pre-\ncondition for building affective relationships. Although some agency workers have been \nEmployment status and commitment \n23 \nworking for the user firm for years, they still have a realistic awareness that their arrangement \nwith the firm can end from one day to the next. They are consequently cautious when \ninvesting emotionally in their colleagues. A comparable phenomenon has been noted in the \nresearch into so-called serial expatriates: they seem to be unable to build strong relationships \nwith others (Richardson and Zikic 2007).   \nThis study has limitations. The study comprised of only cross-sectional data. A \nlongitudinal design is needed to test whether tenure, HR practices, and\/or changing \nemployment status (from agency worker to permanent employee) really predict commitment. \nA further limitation was the restriction to one employee group (low- to medium skilled blue-\ncollar workers) in one sector (metal industry). Further research should be done with different \nand larger samples. Considering the importance of agency and user firm supervisors, we \nrecommend that both be included in future research on the employment status-commitment \nlink. Research on Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) shows that the quality of the relationship \nwith the supervisor influences the delegation of challenging tasks, commitment, occupational \nself-efficacy, and performance (e.g. Dunegan, Duchon and Uhl-Bien 1992; Graen, Novak and \nSommerkamp 1982; Schyns, Paul, Mohr and Blank 2005). Hence, supervisors from both \nagency and user firm are likely to impact commitment.  \n Notwithstanding these limitations, this study has implications for future research and \npractices. Authors who assume that agency work cannot be beneficial for agency workers and \nthe user company in the long term seem to ignore research that supports the idea that the \nattitudes and behaviours of agency workers do not necessarily suffer. Automatically assuming \na negative effect of agency work seems also to homogenise HR practices concerning agency \nworkers: agency workers are not necessarily day labourers, used to accepting short-term \nfluctuations for unfair material and immaterial rewards. Some companies seem to understand \nthat they are dependent on agency workers\u2018 effort for maximizing organizational efficiency \nEmployment status and commitment \n24 \nand are willing to invest in them with attractive HR policies. Therefore, user firms\u2018 decisions \nconcerning the employment status are not an exclusive predictor of agency workers\u2018 attitudes \nand behaviours, although the overall treatment of non-permanent staff is. In addition, some \nagency workers voluntarily choose the \u2017power of a potential good-bye\u2018 (Torka and Schyns \n2007). For this group of agency workers, a traditional employment relationship may include \nundesired outcomes. Finally, other countries can benefit from the Dutch experience, as Dutch \nnational legislation for agency workers, in contrast to legislation in other countries, makes it \npossible to treat agency workers the same as permanent staff and offer them a long-term \ntenure within the user firm. These regulations do not restrict firms and allow HR practices that \nare positive for the development of agency workers\u2018 attitudes and behaviours. \n \nREFERENCES \nAllen, N.J. and Meyer, J.P.
