Solutions of Friedrichs systems are in general not of Sobolev\nregularity and may possess discontinuities along the characteristics of\nthe differential operator. We state a setting in which the well-posedness\nof Friedrichs systems on polyhedral domains is ensured, while still allow-\ning changes in the inertial type of the boundary. In this framework the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method converges in the energy norm under h-\nand p-refinement to the exact solution.\n1 Introduction\nFriedrichs systems are first-order linear boundary value problems which allow\nthe study of a wide range of hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic differential equa-\ntions in a unified framework [1]. Because of this unifying approach, Friedrichs\nsystems provide tools for the study of mixed-type problems, i.e. boundary value\nproblems, which change their type depending on the position in the domain.\nFor instance, equations in compressible gas dynamics can be transformed into\nFriedrichs systems, where regions of supersonic flow correspond to a locally hy-\nperbolic differential operator, while subsonic regions correspond to a local model\nof elliptic type [2].\nIn general, the solution of a Friedrichs systems is not contained in a Sobolev\nspace. Instead it belongs to the associated graph space, i.e. it is weakly dif-\nferentiable along the charactistics of the differential operator. Functions in the\ngraph space may be discontinuous. In addition, poles in the solution, due to\ntype-changes of the differential operator or the boundary conditions, may lead\nto a loss of the integration-by-parts rule in its classical sense [3]. This is in close\nconnection to the question of well-posedness of Friedrichs systems [4\u201310].\nIn 1973 Reed and Hill [11, 12] introduced the discontinuous Galerkin method\n(DGFEM) to solve the neutron transport equation. Already in this paper, nu-\nmerical experiments make the good approximation and stability properties of\nthe DGFEM for boundary value problems with discontinuous solution apparent.\nAssuming shape-regularity, LeSaint and Raviart prove in [13] for meshes with\ntriangular and quadrilateral elements the suboptimal L2(\u2126)-error bound\n\u2016u\u2212 uDG\u2016L2(\u2126) \u2264 C hp \u2016u\u2016Wp+1,2(\u2126), C > 0,\nfor solutions u in W p+1,2(\u2126) and DG solutions uDG. Johnson and his coworkers\n[14, 15] show for equations with non-constant coefficients and certain Friedrichs\nsystems an improved O(hp) bound in the DG energy norm. Bey and Oden [16]\nextend the analysis to non-uniform p. In the framework by Houston, Schwab and\nSu\u00a8li [17, 18] the exact solution u is only required to be elementwise of Sobolev\nregularity. Thus u may be discontinuous along element edges.\nThe afore-mentioned publications have in common that their a priori analysis\nis restricted to solutions which are of elementwise or global Sobolev regularity.\nSolutions with discontinuities across elements are not covered, for which already\nReed and Hill and also others [16, 18] highlighted the competitive performance\nof the DG method with numerical experiments.\nIn this publication we address the convergence of the discontinuous Galerkin\nmethod in graph spaces. We base our analysis on Friedrichs systems which allow\ntypical changes in the inertial type of the boundary conditions such as between\nin- and outflow components, but which at the same time satisfy basic require-\nments such as the integration-by-parts formula.\n2 Friedrichs Systems\nLet \u2126 be a bounded Lipschitz domain in IRn. Let m \u2208 IN. Given a tensor\nB \u2208W 1,\u221e(\u2126)m\u00d7m\u00d7n and a matrix C \u2208 L\u221e(\u2126)m\u00d7m, we consider the differential\noperator\nL : v 7\u2192 \u2202k(Bijk vj) + Cijvj ,\nmaking use of the Einstein summation convention and assuming that v and the\ncoefficients B and C are real-valued. We denote by \u03bd the unit outward normal\nof \u2126 and by B(\u03bd) the matrix B(\u03bd)ij = Bijk \u03bdk. With Dij := Cij + 12 \u2202kBijk, the\nsymmetry condition\nBijk = Bjik, i, j \u2208 {1, . . . ,m}, k \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, (1)\nimplies for v, w \u2208 H1(\u2126)m\n\u3008Lv, w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008v,Lw\u3009\u2126 = 2\u3008Dv,w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008B(\u03bd) v, w\u3009\u2202\u2126 , (2)\nwhere \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009\u2126 and \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009\u2202\u2126 are the L2-scalar products on \u2126 and \u2202\u2126. If (1) is\nsatisfied and there is a constant \u03b3 > 0 such that v \u00b7Dv\u2212 \u03b3v \u00b7 v is positive on \u2126,\nwe call L accretive. Notice that \u3008Lv, v\u3009\u2126 \u2265 \u03b3 \u2016v\u2016L2(\u2126)m for v \u2208 H10 (\u2126)m.\nBoundary operators J : \u2202\u2126 \u2192 IRm\u00d7m are semi-admissible if R := J+ 12 B(\u03bd)\nis positive semi-definite [1]. Then, due to (2),\n\u3008Lv, v\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Jv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 = \u3008Dv, v\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Rv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 \u2265 \u03b3 \u2016v\u2016L2(\u2126)m (3)\nfor v \u2208 H1(\u2126)m. Let JT be the transpose of J . Given the formal adjoint operator\nL\u2032 : v 7\u2192 \u2212Bjik\u2202kvj + Cjivj , the adjoint boundary operator J \u2032 = JT + B(\u03bd)\nsatisfies\n\u3008Lv, w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Jv,w\u3009\u2202\u2126 = \u3008v,L\u2032w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008v, J \u2032w\u3009\u2202\u2126 , v, w \u2208 H1(\u2126)m.\nLet f \u2208 L2(\u2126)m. One says that a function u \u2208 L2(\u2126)m solves the boundary\nvalue problem Lu = f, Ju = 0 weakly if for all v \u2208 C1(\u2126)m with J \u2032v = 0 the\nidentity\n\u3008f, v\u3009\u2126 = \u3008u,L\u2032v\u3009\u2126 (4)\nholds.\nFriedrichs [1] proves that a weak solution always exits if L is accretive and\nJ is semi-admissible. Clearly, Lu is equal to f in the sense of distributions.\nTherefore the solution u belongs to the graph space of L. That is the set\nH(L, \u2126) := {v \u2208 L2(\u2126)m : Lv \u2208 L2(\u2126)m},\nwhich is normed by\n\u2016v\u20162L := \u2016v\u20162L2(\u2126)m + \u2016Lv\u20162L2(\u2126)m .\nIn what sense u satisfies the boundary conditions is more intricate. We assume\ninitially that u belongs to C0(\u2126)m to delay the definition of a trace operator.\nBecause the test functions in (4) are contained in ker J \u2032, the test space may be\ntoo small to ensure that Ju = 0. We call PJ , PJ\u2032 \u2208 IRm\u00d7m a pair of projections\nif\nPJ + PJ\u2032 = I and PJPJ\u2032 = PJ\u2032PJ = 0.\nSemi-admissible boundary operators J are called admissible if for each x \u2208 \u2202\u2126\nthere is a pair of projections PJ , PJ\u2032 \u2208 IRm\u00d7m such that\nJ(x) = \u2212PJ(x)TB(\u03bd, x) and J \u2032(x) = B(\u03bd, x)PJ\u2032(x).\nUnder sufficient regularity, e.g. for each v \u2208 C1(\u2126)m there is a v\u02d9 \u2208 C1(\u2126)m\nsuch that PJv = v\u02d9 on \u2202\u2126, admissibility of J guarantees Ju = 0. Boundary\nvalue problems consisting of an accretive differential operator and admissible\nboundary operators are called Friedrichs systems.\nThe following example, which is an adaptation of [3], shows that for weak\nsolutions the integration-by-parts formula is in general not valid.\nExample 1. Let \u2126 = (0, 1)2 and\nLv := LCRv + v, LCRv :=\n(\u2212\u2202x \u2202y\n\u2202y \u2202x\n) (\nv1\nv2\n)\n.\nThe boundary conditions\nJ |x=1 :=\n(\n1 1\n0 0\n)\n, J |x=0 :=\n(\n0 0\n1 1\n)\n, J |y=1 :=\n(\n0 \u22121\n0 0\n)\n, J |y=0 :=\n(\n0 1\n0 0\n)\nare admissible. Since LCR is the Cauchy-Riemann operator and the function\nv(\u03c6, r) := r\u22121\/2(cos\u03c6\/2,\u2212 sin\u03c6\/2) in polar coordinates (\u03c6, r) represents the\nholomorphic function z\u22121\/2, it follows that LCRv = 0 and Lv = v. Let \u03c8 \u2208\nC1(\u2126) be a radially symmetric function with support in the unit ball and which\nis equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of the origin. Then u := \u03c8 v \u2208 L2(\u2126)m satisfies\npointwise and weakly the homogeneous boundary conditions Ju = 0 on \u2202\u2126 and\nLu = f with f := (\u03c8(r)\u2212 \u03c8\u2032(r))v \u2208 L2(\u2126)m.\nFor bounded smooth functions w which satisfy the homogeneous boundary\nconditions, the operator iLCR is self-adjoint and therefore\n\u222b\n\u2126\nLCRw \u00b7 w dx = 0.\nIn contrast,\n\u222b\n\u2126\nLCRu \u00b7 u dx = pi\/4. Consequently, formula (2) is not valid for\nu \u2208 H(L, \u2126).\nThe loss of the integration-by-parts formula has far-reaching implications on\nthe analysis of the discontinuous Galerkin method. It is, for instance, used for\nthe definition of the energy norm.\nInsight why the formula fails is given by the trace operator of H(L, \u2126). We\nreport relevant properties of the operator, but refer for details to [19]. The trace\noperator\nT : H(L, \u2126)\u2192 H\u22121\/2(\u2202\u2126)m, v 7\u2192 \u3008B(\u03bd)v, \u00b7\u3009\nis bounded, but in general not surjective. We equip the trace space H(T , \u2202\u2126) :=\nim T with the norm\n\u2016v\u2016T := inf{\u2016w\u2016L : w \u2208 H(L, \u2126) and T w = v}.\nThe terminology trace operator and trace space for T and H(T , \u2202\u2126) is justified\nby the observation that all mappings J : H(L, \u2126)\u2192 V which vanish onH10 (\u2126)m\ncan be factorised in the form J = J\u02d9 \u25e6T where J\u02d9 : H(T , \u2202\u2126)\u2192 V is continuous\nand V is any abstract normed vector space. Up to homeomorphy only H(T , \u2202\u2126)\nhas this property.\nExample 2. Let \u2126 := {(x, y) \u2208 IR2 : y > |x| and y < 1} and Lv = \u2202xv. Then\ny\u22121\/2 \u2208 H(L, \u2126). The only admissible boundary conditions J with respect to L\nare inflow conditions. Yet for them, \u3008Jv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 diverges. Thus (v, w) 7\u2192 \u3008Jv,w\u3009\u2202\u2126\nis not continuous onH(L, \u2126)\u00d7H(L, \u2126) and (3) cannot be continuously extended\nfrom H1(\u2126)m to H(L, \u2126).\nThe properties of the trace space are connected to the eigenvalues of B(\u03bd).\nDue to (1), for each x \u2208 \u2202\u2126 there is an orthogonal transformation X and a\ndiagonal matrix \u039b such that B(\u03bd) = XT\u039bX. Substituting in \u039b negative entries\nby 0 gives \u039b+. The positive and negative semi-definite components of B(\u03bd) are\nB+(\u03bd) := XT\u039b+X and B\u2212(\u03bd) := B(\u03bd)\u2212B+(\u03bd), respectively. The absolute part\nis |B|(\u03bd) := B+(\u03bd)\u2212B\u2212(\u03bd). A change in the rank of B+(\u03bd) or B\u2212(\u03bd) is termed\na change in the inertial type of B(\u03bd).\nThe space L2B(\u2202\u2126) is the set of all integrable functions v : \u2202\u2126 \u2192 IRm for\nwhich the norm\n\u2016v\u20162B :=\n\u222b\n\u2202\u2126\nv \u00b7 |B|(\u03bd)v dx\nis finite. The space L\u221eB (\u2202\u2126)\nm\u00d7m consists of the matrices in L\u221e(\u2202\u2126)m\u00d7m which\ndefine an endomorphism on L2B(\u2202\u2126).\nTraces \u3008B(\u03bd)v, \u00b7\u3009 contained in H\u22121\/2(\u2202\u2126)m \\ L2(\u2202\u2126)m can arise through\na coupling of in- and outflow components. Pointwise we understand under in-\nand outflow components the eigenspaces of B(\u03bd) associated to negative and\npositive eigenvalues, respectively. For instance, in Example 2 in- and outflow\nboundary are coupled through the sign change of B(\u03bd) at the origin. Traces in\nH\u22121\/2(\u2202\u2126)m \\L2(\u2202\u2126)m are not limited to domains with corners. Coupling with\ntangential components of L has comparable effects.\nExample 3. Let \u2126 = {(x, y) \u2208 IR2 : x > 0} and\nLv = \u2202x\n\uf8eb\uf8ed\u22121 0 00 1 0\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 v + \u2202y\u221a\n2\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0 0 \u221210 0 1\n\u22121 1 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 v.\nThe trace space of u \u2208 H(L, \u2126) is equal to\n{(v1 \u2212 v2, v1 + v2, 0) : v1 \u2208 H1\/2(\u2202\u2126)m and v2 \u2208 H\u22121\/2(\u2202\u2126)m}\nwith the intrinsic norm (\u2016v1\u20162H1\/2(\u2202\u2126)m + \u2016v2\u20162H\u22121\/2(\u2202\u2126)m)1\/2.\nTo provide a basis for definition of the discontinuous Galerkin method for\nFriedrichs systems, we introduce the additional condition that there is a fac-\ntorisation of B(\u03bd) of the form B(\u03bd) = (R + RT)F . Then one can ensure that\nthe solution of the Friedrichs system is unique and contained in the closure\nH(L, B,\u2126) of H1(\u2126)m in the norm\n(\u2016v\u20162L + \u2016v\u20162B)1\/2, v \u2208 H1(\u2126)m.\nFunctions in H(L, B,\u2126) have a trace in L2B(\u2202\u2126) and satisfy formula (2).\nTheorem 1. Let L be an accretive operator and J be semi-admissible. Suppose\nthat there are two projections P1, P2 \u2208 L\u221eB (\u2202\u2126)m\u00d7m such that J = \u2212B(\u03bd)P1 and\nJ \u2032 = B(\u03bd)P2. We also adopt the hypothesis that there is an F \u2208 L\u221eB (\u2202\u2126)m\u00d7m\nsuch that B(\u03bd) = (R + RT)F . Then for each f \u2208 L2(\u2126)m and g \u2208 L2B(\u2202\u2126)\nthere is a unique function u \u2208 H(L, B,\u2126) which solves Lu = f and Ju = Jg.\nFurthermore, u depends continuously on f and g.\nFor details we refer to [19]. We remark that P1 and P2 are not necessarily a\npair of projections. Also note that we assume g \u2208 L2B(\u2202\u2126) and not g \u2208 H(T , \u2202\u2126).\nExample 4. Let H be the Heaviside function. Selecting\n(P1)ij := XkiH(\u039bkk)Xkj , (P2)ij := XkiH(\u2212\u039bkk)Xkj , F := P2 \u2212 P1\nshows that inflow boundary conditions satisfy the requirements set in Theorem 1.\n3 The Discontinuous Galerkin Method\nLet T = {\u03ba1, \u03ba2, . . . , \u03baN} be a decomposition of \u2126 into polyhedral elements \u03bai.\nSuppose that all \u03ba \u2208 T are an affine image of a fixed master element \u03ba\u02c6, i.e.\n\u03ba = F\u03ba(\u03ba\u02c6) for all \u03ba \u2208 T , where F\u03ba is an injective affine mapping and where \u03ba\u02c6\nis either the open unit simplex or the open unit hypercube in IRn. We denote\nby Pk the space of polynomials on \u03ba\u02c6 with total degree less or equal k. If \u03ba\u02c6 is\nthe hypercube then we also consider the space Qk of tensor-polynomials on \u03ba\u02c6\nwith degree less or equal k in each coordinate direction. Let p = (p1, p2, . . . , pN )\nbe a vector which associates to each element \u03bai the polynomial degree pi. We\nconsider the finite element spaces\nS(T, p) = {v \u2208 L2(\u2126) : v|\u03ba \u25e6 F\u03ba \u2208 Rp\u03ba},\nwhere Rk is either Pk or Qk.\nThe finite element spaces S(T, p) are contained in the broken graph space\nH(L, B, T ) :=\n\u2295\n\u03ba\u2208T\nH(L, B, \u03ba).\nAt the boundary \u2202\u03bai\u2229\u2202\u03baj between the element \u03bai and a neighbour \u03baj , a member\nv of H(L, B, T ) has, in general, two distinct traces: one from the restriction v|\u03bai\nand one from v|\u03baj . We denote the internal trace (v|\u03bai)|\u2202\u03bai of \u03bai by v+ and\nthe external trace (v|\u03baj )|\u2202\u03bai\u2229\u2202\u03baj of \u03bai by v\u2212. Altogether the external trace v\u2212 is\ncomposed from the traces of all elements neighbouring \u03bai. The difference v+\u2212v\u2212\nis denoted by [v].\nFor v, w \u2208 H(L, B, T ) let\nBDG(v, w) = \u3008Lv, w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Jv,w\u3009\u2202\u2126 +\n\u2211\n\u03ba\u2208T\n\u3008B\u2212(\u03bd)[v], w+\u3009\u2202\u03ba\\\u2202\u2126 ,\n`DG(w) = \u3008f, w\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Jg,w\u3009\u2202\u2126 .\nThe integration-by-parts formula\nBDG(v, v) = \u3008Dv, v\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Rv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 + 12\n\u2211\n\u03ba\u2208T \u3008|B|(\u03bd)[v], [v]\u3009\u2202\u03ba\\\u2202\u2126\ninduces the energy norm \u2016v\u2016DG :=\n\u221a\nBDG(v, v) on H(L, B, T ). We remark that\nH(L, B, T ) is not complete in this norm.\nLet T \u2032 be another finite element mesh on\u2126 and suppose that v \u2208 H(L, B, T )\u2229\nH(L, B, T \u2032). The energy norm is mesh-independent in the sense that\n\u3008Dv, v\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Rv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 + 12\n\u2211\n\u03ba\u2208T \u3008|B|(\u03bd)[v], [v]\u3009\u2202\u03ba\\\u2202\u2126\n= \u3008Dv, v\u3009\u2126 + \u3008Rv, v\u3009\u2202\u2126 + 12\n\u2211\n\u03ba\u2208T \u2032\u3008|B|(\u03bd)[v], [v]\u3009\u2202\u03ba\\\u2202\u2126 .\nThe positive definiteness of BDG implies that there is a unique discontinuous\nGalerkin solution uDG \u2208 S(T, p) to\nBDG(uDG, w) = `DG(w) \u2200w \u2208 S(T, p).\nThe solution satisfies the stability estimate\n\u2016uDG\u2016DG \u2264 \u03b3\u22121\u2016f\u2016L2(\u2126)m + C\u2016g\u2016B .\nThe constant C > 0 depends on the boundary operator J but not on the ap-\nproximation space [19].\nThe next theorem shows that the discontinuous Galerkin method converges\nin the energy norm under h- and p-refinement.\nTheorem 2. The discontinuous Galerkin solution satisfies the bound\n\u2016u\u2212 uDG\u2016DG \u2264 C inf{\u2016u\u2212 v\u2016L : v \u2208 S(T, p) \u2229H(L, \u2126)}.\nThe constant C > 0 is independent of p and T .\nThe proof relies on Galerkin orthogonality and on the factorisation of the bound-\nary conditions with F , cf.
