Szabados\u2020\nResearch Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics, H\u20131525 Budapest 114, P. O. Box 49, Hungary\nK.P. Tod\u2021\nMathematical Institute, Oxford OX1 3LB, England\nIn a recent letter to this journal, [1], Liu and Yau pro-\npose a definition of quasi-local mass, which in fact coin-\ncides with the \u2018quasi-local free energy\u2019 of Kijowski [2], for\nany space-like, topological 2-sphere with positive intrin-\nsic (or Gauss) curvature. They are then able to prove\npositivity of this mass by exploiting a result of Shi and\nTam, [3]. In this Comment we present a simple class of\nexamples, for which the whole construction is easy to see,\nto show that there are space-like, topological 2-spheres in\nflat space-time for which this mass is strictly positive.\nKijowski, Liu and Yau restrict consideration to 2-\nsurfaces \u03a3 with positive intrinsic curvature (and sub-\nject to a second condition, given below). Such a \u03a3 can\nbe isometrically embedded, uniquely up to isometry, in\nflat (Euclidean) 3-space E3 with positive-definite extrin-\nsic curvature tensor, and the Kijowski-Liu-Yau definition\nof quasi-local energy (equation (105) of [2] and (3) of [1])\nis then\nEKLY =\n1\n8piG\n\u222b\n\u03a3\n(k0 \u2212 k) (1)\nwhere G is Newton\u2019s gravitational constant, k0 is the\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature of \u03a3 as embedded in E3\nand k is given in terms of the Newman-Penrose spin-\ncoefficients \u03c1 and \u00b5, (see [4] or [5]), as\nk =\n\u221a\n8\u03c1\u00b5. (2)\nKijowski and Liu and Yau require the product \u03c1\u00b5 to be\npositive for their definition, and this is the second condi-\ntion on \u03a3 whose necessity was noted above.\nClearly, (1) will give EKLY = 0 for any \u03a3 which lies in\na space-like hyperplane in flat space-time. However, for\na \u03a3 in flat space-time, with positive intrinsic curvature\nand positive \u03c1\u00b5 but which does not lie in a space-like\nhyperplane, there is no reason to think that EKLY should\nvanish, and, as we shall see, it need not.\nThe idea is to consider a 2-surface which is a cross-\nsection of the light-cone of the origin in flat space-\ntime. We introduce standard spherical polar coordinates\n(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) based at the origin. The future light-cone N\nof the origin is given by t = r > 0 and we may define a\ntopological 2-sphere \u03a3 lying on N by an equation\nt = r = F (\u03b8, \u03c6) (3)\nfor a positive, smooth function F . With a natural choice\nof normals to \u03a3, the relevant spin-coefficients are given\nby\n\u03c1 =\n\u22121\u221a\n2F\n; \u00b5 =\n\u22121\u221a\n2F\n(1\u2212\u2206 logF ) (4)\nwhere \u2206 is the Laplacian on the unit sphere. The spin-\ncoefficient \u03c3 is zero (as the light-cone is shear-free) so the\nintrinsic curvature K of \u03a3, calculated from (4.14.20) in\n[5], is\nK = 2\u03c1\u00b5. (5)\n(Note the relation of K to k in equation (2): k = 2\n\u221a\nK).\nThus \u03a3 has positive intrinsic curvature and positive \u03c1\u00b5\niff \u2206 logF < 1, which is easy to arrange. Suppose this\nholds, then following the prescription of Kijowski, Liu\nand Yau, we embed \u03a3 into E3, where it will define a con-\nvex topological 2-sphere \u03a30 with mean curvature say H\nand intrinsic curvature K as above. We calculate EKLY\nusing equations (1), (2) and (5) above to find the expres-\nsion\nEKLY =\n1\n8piG\n\u222b\n\u03a3\n(2H \u2212 2\n\u221a\nK). (6)\nNow (6), for an arbitrary convex topological 2-sphere \u03a30\nin E3, clearly need not vanish. In terms of the usual\nprincipal curvatures \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, both positive for a convex\nsurface, (6) becomes\nEKLY =\n1\n8piG\n\u222b\n\u03a3\n(\n\u221a\n\u03bb1 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03bb2)2.\nThis vanishes for a round 2-sphere (as expected, since in\nthis case the cross-section of N in fact lies in a hyper-\nplane) but is otherwise positive: the Kijowski-Liu-Yau\ndefinition can be strictly positive for space-like, topolog-\nical 2-spheres in flat space-time.\nThis work was initiated at the Erwin Schro\u00a8dinger In-\nstitut, Vienna and we gratefully acknowledge the hos-\npitality of the Institut.
