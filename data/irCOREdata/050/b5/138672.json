Introduction\nIn the UK, the use of solar power as a widely recognised energy efficiency measure in domestic situations is\ninnovative, compared with conventional methods, for example loft and cavity wall insulation, or high efficiency\nboilers (Schonherr 2003). To date it is only being used to generate 13.4 GWh of power, equivalent to the\naverage annual energy use of 3,350 households (DTI 2003). The UK Government has proposed a series of\npolicies to help combat greenhouse gas emissions from domestic use (Boniface 2003), including setting national\ntargets for increasing the use of solar power (Oxera & Arup 2002; Land Use Consultants and IT Power 2001).\nThese targets represent a significant increase from the existing installed capacity and success in the domestic\nsector will be dependent on private householders adopting the technology. In 2002, the Northamptonshire Home\nEnergy Efficiency Partnership developed a marketing and grant scheme for domestic solar systems, covering\nboth Solar Thermal (ST) and Photovoltaic (PV) technologies. ST systems use the available heat energy to warm\n3a liquid that passes through a pipe system facing the sun, which is in turn passed through a heat exchange and\nthe heat stored in a thermal store, whereas PV systems convert light energy into electrical current using a\ncharged array. Interest in the technology was high, but despite the provision of grants that reduce the capital cost\nby up to 50%, very few households actually purchased a system. This research was commissioned to examine\nconsumer attitudes towards domestic solar energy systems in order to identify the barriers to the adoption of\nsolar systems and inform future marketing activity.\n2. Solar power systems\nPast research shows that both types of domestic solar systems are well-suited to an urban environment, are a\nproven and effective technology, and offer the opportunity for individuals to make a statement about their\nenvironmental beliefs (BRECSU 2001). The systems are also defined as economic (Book 1999), affordable\n(Berger 2001), compatible with other technologies (Knudsen 2001), able to reduce pollution (Luque 2001), and\ntechnically reliable (Cabraal 1998). Timilsina et al. (2000) suggest solar power is attractive at a national policy\nlevel because it can reduce national carbon emissions and contribute to the GDP through jobs and income in the\nmanufacturing and engineering sectors and provide an export product.\nSolar systems can raise a householder\u2019s awareness of energy consumption by means of a monitoring facility\nprovided with the installation. This enhanced awareness of energy use could encourage further energy\nefficiency. Truffer et al (2001) define this type of efficiency as using \u2018negawatts\u2019; units of energy never used,\nperhaps due to intervention by an energy efficient product or more efficient behaviour arising from changing\nattitudes towards energy use. This type of behavioural change is advantageous to the adoption of solar as it\nincreases the compatibility of the systems with current energy consumption trends. An example can be seen in\nhot water consumption trends in Denmark, where the average daily hot water demand has dropped from 250\nlitres per day to 100 litres per day, which matches the daily hot water production of a ST system (Knudsen\n2002).\nHowever, despite their positive characteristics, solar systems remain unattractive to individual householders as a\nhome improvement (Timilsina 2000) and incompatible with personal priorities (Berger 2001). Issues such as\nlong simple payback periods, high capital costs and a lack of confidence in the long-term performance of the\nsystems are limiting widespread adoption (ETSU 2001; Timilsina 2000). Knudsen (2001) reports that oversized\n4systems are often installed which adds expense. Cabraal (1998) proposes that quality service, products and\nsupport should help overcome the high initial costs. Oliver and Jackson (1999) state that installed costs are\nbeing reduced, however, in later research Luque (2001) concludes that there is very little potential for reducing\ncosts in the future. However, to provide an attractive payback period of less than or equal to ten years, the\nsystems would need to cost approximately \u00a31000 at 2003 UK prices (BRECSU 2001), which would mean a\nreduction of at least \u00a31500 - \u00a32000. In the case of PV, it is suggested that unless electricity prices rise, or\ncheaper and more efficient panels are developed, it will not be competitive with conventionally produced\nelectricity (Luque 2001).\n3. The Adoption and Diffusion process\nThe diffusion of an innovation is the process by which it is communicated through certain channels, over time\nand among members of a social system. The diffusion process has been modelled and theorised over time, and\ndespite some weaknesses regarding the forecasting of adoption and an inherent pro-innovation bias, it has been\nfavourably reviewed. Examples include the Bass model and the Roberts and Urban model (cited in Mahajan et\nal 1990; Lynn and Gelb 1996; Sultan and Winer 1993). Diffusion of Innovations Theory (Rogers 1995) sets out\na practical innovation adoption process. The speed at which an adopter passes along this process is influenced\nby the attributes of particular innovations, and the propensity of the adopter to accept innovation. The theory\nhas been utilised to model the diffusion of a range of products, for example agricultural products and techniques\n(Rogers 1995), medical treatment protocols and emergency contraception (Heimburger et al. 2002), and the use\nof solar power systems (Kaplan 1999; Labay and Kinnear 1981; Velayudhan 2002).\nThe innovation-decision process (see Figure 1) systematically follows five phases that adopters will follow\nwhen deciding whether or not to procure an innovation. Firstly, adopters need to be knowledgeable of a product,\nand then be motivated to raise their awareness about it. At the \u2018awareness\u2019 stage, the adopter is concerned with\nthe attributes of the innovation, particularly any advantages it has over another product. The innovation must\npossess attributes that are perceived as attractive to adopters, although this level of attraction will vary between\nindividuals as they all vary in their disposition to adopt the products. The awareness stage in the process is the\noptimal point at which to gain a full understanding of the product attributes and thus overcome any risk of post-\npurchase dissonance. At the \u2018decision\u2019 stage, an adopter can choose to either adopt or reject the innovation,\nalthough if adopted, use of the innovation can be later discontinued. The actual implementation of the\n5innovation follows the decision to adopt, after which an adopter will confirm that the product meets all\nexpectations. (Rogers 1995).\nNot all individuals follow the innovation-decision process or adopt an innovation at the same time. To reflect\nthis, diffusion theory identifies five adopter categories as the diffusion sequence unfolds (Rogers 1995). The\ncategorisation is based on consumer personality and behaviour, values and attitudes. Figure 1 shows that\nadopters are categorised into (a) \u2018innovators\u2019 (2.5% of adopters), (b) early adopters (12.5%), (c) early majority\n(35%), (d) late majority (35%) and (e) laggards (15%). The theory suggests that the distribution of these\ncategories follows a normal distribution curve, with the first 50% of eventual consumers being in the first three\nadopter categories. Rogers (1995) proposes general profiles for each adopter category, based on socio-\neconomic, personality and communication behaviour characteristics. The \u2018innovators\u2019 and \u2018Early Adopters\u2019,\ndisplay characteristics such as more years of education, and a greater knowledge about the technology. Sultan\nand Winer (1993) challenge the profile of adopters as proposed by Rogers (1995) arguing that there is\ninconsistency in behaviour across products; that is to say, an \u2018innovator\u2019 for one product may be a \u2018laggard\u2019 for\nanother, suggesting that innovativeness is a relative phenomenon.\nMoore (1999) develops the utility of adopter categories by adding the concept of a \u2018chasm\u2019 between the early\nadopters and the early majority (see Figure 1). The concept of the chasm arises because personality traits\nbetween adopter categories differ. \u2018Innovators\u2019 and \u2018early adopters\u2019, who are committed to the concept of the\ninnovation, will put up with inconvenience factors to do with product complexity or lack of performance\nbecause they are focused on the long-term benefits the innovation may have. The width of the chasm becomes\nsmaller if the innovation attributes are sufficiently developed to appear attractive to the more pragmatic\naudience of the \u2018majority\u2019 categories; therefore it is important for manufacturers to develop the products with\nthe earlier adopter categories to make them more reliable and productive. Pragmatic \u2018early majority\u2019 adopters\nwill find innovations attractive when they originate from an established manufacturer, have a recognisable\nquality, and fit within a supporting infrastructure of products and systems. Pragmatists care about the quality\nand reliability of service they receive from suppliers. While it appears that the \u2018early majority\u2019 are a more\nchallenging group to satisfy, they are vital for the sustained success of the innovation as they number three times\nmore than the innovative categories.\n6Garling and Thorgesen (2001) suggest that earlier adopters have developed internal reference prices based on\nknowledge and competence. In other words, the actual cost of the innovation is not important; what matters is\nwhat it is worth to them as individuals. These values can transcend demographic or socio-economic\ncategorisation For example, an electric vehicle will be more readily adopted by an individual who is more\ninterested in improving air quality and reducing demand for natural resources, than by an individual who desires\nspeed and performance. Solar power systems in particular are an innovation designed for reducing pressure on\nenvironmental resources and it seems logical that \u2018green\u2019 consumers should be attracted to buy them. However,\nprevious research findings relating to \u2018green consumers\u2019 are often inconclusive and incompatible with the\nprofile of Rogers\u2019 adopter categories (Laroche et. al. 2001). Pedersen (2000) also points out that inconsistencies\nexist within \u2018green\u2019 consumption areas, stating that individuals' purchasing behaviour is not predictable between\n\u2018eco-products\u2019. For example, \u2018green\u2019 consumers won\u2019t necessarily favour \u2018green\u2019 energy products just because\nthey recycle materials, use \u2018green\u2019 transport or purchase organic food and verbally state that they favour\nenvironmental issues.\nSeveral authors agree that the features of the innovation or other environmental features have greater influence\non the adoption decision than the adopters\u2019 demographic profile (Pedersen 2000; Garling and Thorgesen 2001;\nMartinez et. al 1998; Lynn and Gelb 1996). However, it has been shown that demographics are useful for\nunderstanding perceptions, environmental knowledge and attitudes of \u2018green\u2019 consumers (Diamantopoulos et al.\n2003), particularly as these consumers display varying shades of \u2018green\u2019 behaviour (Peattie 2001). In turn,\nanalysis of perceptions can be used to assess the rate of adoption, and time preferences for products (Sultan and\nWiner 1993). The study of perceptions has been used in marketing research to form the basis for studying\nmotivations and attitudes (Lusk 1973; Auty and Elliott 1998; Hsu et al 2000). Perceptions and attitudes can\naffect consumer behaviour and innovation adoption. Perception is the process by which individuals make sense\nof sensations utilising their sensory receptors, whereas attitude is the way that an individual views, or behaves\ntowards an object, often in an evaluative way (Kotler 2003).\nDiffusion theory proposes that innovations have five predominant attributes. These are relative advantage,\ncompatibility, observability, trialability, and complexity (see Figure 1). The \u2018relative advantage\u2019 describes the\nmarginal advantage an innovation has over existing products, which can be expressed through a variety of\nfactors. \u2018Compatibility\u2019 describes how the innovation fits with an adopter\u2019s values, attitudes and behaviour.\n7Attributes are also related to how visible the innovation is (\u2018observability\u2019), or how accessible it is for\nindividuals to use on a trial basis (\u2018trialability\u2019). \u2018Complexity\u2019 is considered as a restrictive factor in adoption,\nand describes how difficult it is to understand either the innovation, or its principles (Kai-ming Au and\nEnderwick 2000; Rogers 1995). Consumers develop expectations of products and services prior to adoption\nbased on product attributes, particularly those surrounding \u2018relative advantage\u2019, \u2018compatibility\u2019, and\n\u2018complexity\u2019 (Dunphy and Herbig 1995; Martinez et al 1998).\nUnderstanding consumers' attitudes towards an innovative product provides two key benefits. First, strengths\nand weaknesses in the innovation attributes can be identified and managed effectively (Hsu et al. 2000). Second,\nmore control can be imposed on the marketing strategy in order that the innovation is made attractive to the\nmost receptive audience (Auty and Elliott 1998). The marketing strategy can then take into account the step-\nwise process that individuals take when deciding whether or not to adopt an innovation. However, product\nmanufacturers and marketers must overcome the challenge that consumers' stated behaviour does not always\nmanifest itself in actual consumption behaviour.\nUsing the knowledge gained from the literature, this project investigated three research questions: Firstly, Do\nthe pragmatic \u2018early majority\u2019 have a sufficiently positive attitude towards the characteristics of ST and PV\nsystems which relate to \u2018relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability\u2019 that indicates adoption\nwill follow in the near future? Secondly, Is there a significant difference in attitude towards the characteristics of\nsolar systems between the innovative categories (referred to as the \u2018early adopters\u2019) and the later, more\npragmatic householders (referred to as the \u2018early majority\u2019) or within the socio-economic or demographic sub-\ngroups of the \u2018early majority that would influence marketing activity? Thirdly, is it possible to identify\ncharacteristics of solar power that may be creating the adoption \u2018chasm\u2019 as defined by Moore (1999)?\nIt should be noted that despite there being a difference in the two solar technologies, which will affect the\neconomics of the systems, due to grants in the UK that have become available, the costs of the two technologies\nare comparable. Therefore, the term \u2018solar power\u2019 was throughout the survey process, so as not to confuse\nindividuals who may not appreciate differences in the technology. This is accepted as a limitation in this study.\n84. Methodology\nSeveral techniques and methodologies exist that can be used to research consumer views of innovations, or\nproducts in the development stage. Of these, either Conjoint Analysis or Kelly\u2019s Repertory grid could have been\napplied to this study. These techniques, which focus the attention of the respondent on the product as opposed to\ntheir own needs, can be used to elicit constructs about a product. The critical factor in the choice of technique\nwas that the grid that formed the basis of the survey questionnaire was going to be sent to people who were not\nfamiliar with solar power products. Therefore, it was decided that because Kelly\u2019s repertory grid derives\nconstructs in an unstructured format, the words and phrases used would originate from non-technical sources i.e.\nconsumers, that the resultant survey would be more accessible because the terminology would be more readily\nunderstandable than if the constructs had originated from technical sources. Further, Conjoint Analysis results in\nconstructs being ranked against each other or a pre-determined concept, and the aim of this study was to\nconsider each aspect on its own merit. (For a fuller review of these two techniques see van Kleef et al. 2004).\nFurther research could therefore be carried out using Conjoint Analysis between differing solar products, or\ninvestigating the impact of the differing perspective of the products between consumers and technical experts,\nwho so often sell the products.\nKelly\u2019s Repertory grid method involves personal interviews, during which interviewees choose three words that\nthey believe describes the product; in this case, solar power. These are noted, and the interviewer asks them to\ntake a pair of the words and describe how they are similar, but different to the third. This is repeated until the\ninterviewee has exhausted all their options, and then another pair is chosen. The process results in a series of\ndescriptor pairs, in which the pairs consist of words or phrases that oppose each other. The added value of this\ntriadic sorting technique (Lusk 1973) is that the respondents own terminology describes the product, as opposed\nto a technocrat. A semantic differential table is then developed from these responses. This consists of each pair\nbeing placed at either end of a line, without guide marks, in order to allow respondents to mark their response\nfreely, the concept being that the stronger a respondent feels about the descriptor, the closer to the end of the\nline the mark is placed (Dillon et al 1994).\nFor the purposes of this study, 10 previous adopters of solar power were interviewed to identify the\ncharacteristics of solar power. These 10 were chosen randomly from known adopters of systems, from the\nSolarplan scheme. The survey was tested on 10 other randomly chosen adopters to determine its ease of use.\n9Following this, 8 descriptor pairs were deleted from the test as they either confused the respondent or their\nmeaning was unclear.\nThe survey was then used to survey 100 adopters of solar power (the \u2018early adopters\u2019) and 1000 previous\nadopters of other types of energy efficiency measures, who, for the purposes of this survey were classified as\n\u2018early majority\u2019; i.e. pragmatic enough to purchase energy efficiency measures, but not so innovative as to\npurchase solar power. It should be noted that the 100 adopters of solar power are different to those who were\nused to develop the survey form. The disparity in sample size is due to the small number of people who have\nadopted solar power, and the large number who have adopted loft or cavity wall insulation.\nOn the survey form, the descriptor pairs that describe the characteristics were each placed at either end of a line,\nand down the form, negative and positive attitudes were randomly placed at either end and realigned for the\nanalysis. As previously mentioned, this line was unbroken so as not to prejudice their strength of feeling. To\ninterpret the point at which respondents marked the line, a clear template was placed over the line, which\nseparated it into 13 unnumbered segments. This number of segments was chosen so it was possible to\ndifferentiate scores as clearly as possible. The scores were then given a numeric value from 0-13. The scores\nfrom 0-5.99 were viewed as positive, from 6-7.99 as \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019, and from 8-13 as negative. The reason for\ndescribing the middle scores as \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 is that the survey could not ascertain whether the respondents had\nno opinion on the characteristic, or whether they did not feel sufficiently informed to answer the question.\nRespondents were also asked to provide information about certain demographic and socio-economic factors,\nnamely gender, age, occupation, number of home occupants, household income, location, house type and size,\nand main fuel type.\nThe results are drawn from the data generated by the surveys, comparison of the means between the subgroups\nwithin the \u2018early majority\u2019 group, and a comparison of the means between the \u2018early adopters\u2019 and the \u2018early\nmajority\u2019 for the characteristics.\n5. Results\n10\nThe results of the interviews and the surveys are presented in this section, which details the descriptor pairs used\nto describe the systems, the resulting attitudes to each of these, and the difference in attitude between the survey\ngroups and sub-groups identified within the larger survey group.\n5.1 Bi-polar descriptor pairs of the technology\nThe interviews with the adopters of the technology provided 23 bi-polar descriptor pairs of the characteristics of\nsolar power systems. These have been listed in Table 1, and categorised against Rogers\u2019 innovation attributes\nusing the generalisations described in that text (Rogers 1995). It should be noted that characteristics are not\nmutually exclusive within each attribute category. The descriptor pairs mainly related to the attribute of \u2018relative\nadvantage\u2019 (18 pairs), with eleven pairs relating to \u2018compatibility\u2019 and a nominal four pairs relating to each\ncomplexity and observability. None of the pairs relate to trialability, which is to be expected, as domestic solar\npower is not generally considered to be \u2018trialable\u2019 due to its nature. This would be an area worthy of future\nwork, as solar power is well-used in small-scale applications such as calculators and radios, and more recently in\nstreet lighting and ticket dispensers and the fact that people do not associate small scale applications to larger\napplications may be limiting its acceptance as an energy source.\nAnecdotally, the profile of the interviewed adopters was similar in that they were either retired or approaching\nretirement. Their primary motivations for adoption focused on financial or environmental aspects, or a desire to\nlive sustainably. All the interviewees indicated that they had a surplus of disposable income and were\nconsidering the long-term benefits of energy efficiency on their future financial position; solar was a method for\nreducing future expense in the context of the interviewees having a potentially reduced income later in their\nretired lives. One adopter also indicated the belief that the value of his property would increase by installing a\nsystem.\n5.2 Attitudes to the characteristics of solar power by the \u2018early adopters\u2019\nThe \u2018early adopters\u2019, identified from householders who had adopted solar panels through the Northamptonshire\nSolarplan scheme, provided 43 complete questionnaires, which provided sufficient data to produce a robust\nanalysis of the results using standard statistical techniques. Table 2 shows the values of the responses of the\ninnovator group (shown in brackets).\n11\nAs a reminder, the scores from 0-5.99 were viewed as positive, from 6-7.99 as \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019, and from 8-13 as\nnegative. Considering the mean value of the responses, the \u2018early adopters\u2019 viewed only 4 of the 23\ncharacteristics in a less than positively. Of these four, the issue of \u2018payback\u2019 was viewed as a negative issue,\nwhereas the other three characteristics, relating to affordability, visual attractiveness, and available grants to\nsupport purchase, were returned as \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019. However, given the fact that the respondents had purchased\nsystems, the characteristics were clearly over-ridden in the overall decision process.\nIn table 1, the characteristics were assessed against the \u2018innovation attributes\u2019 as defined by Rogers (1995). The\nresults of the \u2018early adopters\u2019 suggest that the attributes of solar meet the expectations of the adopters,\nsufficiently in terms of compatibility, complexity, and observability, and where the single issue of \u2018payback\u2019\noccurs in terms of relative advantage, their purchase of the systems demonstrates their overall adoption of the\ntechnology.\n5.3 Attitudes to the characteristics of solar power by the \u2018early majority\u2019.\nThe survey of the \u2018early majority\u2019 resulted in 350 complete surveys (35%), which provided sufficient data for\nstatistical analysis. Table 2 provides the value of mean responses, together with the 95% confidence intervals. In\npractical terms this indicates that there is a 95% chance that the respondent would answer within this range of\nscores.\nThe results show that respondents were positive about 13 of the 23 characteristics to a lesser or greater extent,\nbut returned negative responses to 3 characteristics and \u2018don\u2019 know\u2019 to 7. The 13 positive responses focussed\npredominately on the environmental aspects of solar power, such as its ability to reduce carbon emissions,\nreduce pollution and generate power cleanly. However, similarly to the \u2018early adopters\u2019, they were negative\nabout the payback period, and whereas the \u2018early adopters\u2019 returned \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 to the levels of grant\navailable, the attractiveness, and affordability of the systems, the \u2018early majority\u2019 were clearly negative. The\ncharacteristics that were viewed as \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 related mainly to operational elements of the systems, such as\ntheir intrusiveness, their installation and maintenance. This is probably to be expected, as most people\nunfamiliar with the technology will not know how the systems operate on a day-to-day basis.\n12\nThe results indicate that \u2018early majority\u2019 consumers do not have a sufficiently positive perspective of the solar\nsystems against the \u2018innovation attributes\u2019 in order for them to pass along the innovation decision process. They\nhave a positive perspective of only 10 of the 18 characteristics relating to \u2018relative advantage\u2019, 8 of the 11\nrelating to \u2018compatibility\u2019, 2 of the 4 relating to complexity and only 1 of the 4 relating to \u2018observability\u2019. The\nimplications of this are discussed below.\n5.5 Differences between the \u2018early adopters\u2019 and the \u2018early majority\u2019 and differences between sub-groups\nwithin the \u2018early majority\u2019 group.\nBetween the groups\u2019 responses to their perceptions of solar power, 14 instances of statistically significant\ndifference arose. However, none of these provided contrasting perceptions, i.e. negative vs. positive.\nRemembering that mean values under 6 represent a positive attitude, the results show that:\n\uf0b7 7 characteristics showed different levels of positive response, where the \u2018early adopters\u2019 were more positive\neach time e.g. \u2018Solar being a home improvement\u2019 (3.12 vs. 4.46)\n\uf0b7 5 characteristics showed that while the \u2018early adopters\u2019 were positive, the \u2018early majority\u2019 were \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019\ne.g. \u2018maintenance free\u2019 (4.98 vs. 6.43)\n\uf0b7 2 characteristics showed that while the \u2018early adopters\u2019 were \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019, the \u2018early majority\u2019 were\nnegative e.g. \u2018Grant levels\u2019 (7.31 vs. 8.50)\n\uf0b7 Contrary to expectation, the only characteristic that both groups had a negative perspective of, the \u2018payback,\nthe \u2018early majority\u2019 were actually less negative than the \u2018early adopters\u2019 (9.90 vs. 10.86).\nThe value of this comparison was to define the characteristics that may contribute to the \u2018chasm\u2019. This is further\ndefined in section 6.\nThe second research question sought to investigate whether or not there were differences between responses of\nthe sub-groups of the \u2018early majority\u2019. Statistically, differences were found using standard tests to compare\nmeans of response. However, the comparison of the mean values showed that whilst a statistical difference in\nresponse value existed, the actual response did not change, for example all respondents thought that the payback\ntime was too long, but the people aged over 50, thought it was longer than those aged under 50. Other instances\nof this were that:\n\uf0b7 Female respondents were less likely to think that solar would negatively affect the visual landscape,\n13\n\uf0b7 People aged over 50 were more likely to think that the payback is longer compared with people aged under\n50\n\uf0b7 People with a total household income under \u00a350,000 p.a. were more likely to think that solar power\nappreciated in value more than the higher earners did\nThis type of information will be useful when considering \u2018target\u2019 groups for marketing, and the type of\ncommunication messages used. For example, from the instances found, females are more likely to be responsive\nto marketing as they have a marginally better perspective than males, so the communication used should target\nthat group,\nIn conclusion, it would appear to be critical that if solar power is to be adopted, the \u2018\u2018early majority\u2019\u2019 must have\na positive attitude to it. The results of the survey have shown that while the \u2018early majority\u2019 have a positive\nattitude to some characteristics, the characteristics of \u2018relative advantage\u2019 particularly the payback, the level of\ngrant support, and the visual attractiveness of the systems are perceived negatively and are thus limiting\nadoption. In addition, ambiguity towards other operational and aesthetic characteristics as described above may\nbe limiting adoption. In conclusion to the first research question, there appears to be sufficient evidence to\nsuggest that the pragmatic majority, while they may feel positively towards some aspects of solar power, do not\nhave a sufficiently positive attitude towards solar power to be motivated to adopt it.\n6. Marketing implications\nThe conditions explored above lead to some key implications for those who are marketing the systems about the\ntarget consumers and the system attributes.\n6.1 Identifying the \u2018chasm\u2019 and developing the product\nThe difference in perception between the householders that have adopted the technology and those that have not\nis suggested to constitute the adoption \u2018chasm\u2019 (Moore 1999). The results of the survey have shown that\nbetween the householders identified as \u2018early adopters\u2019, and those identified as the \u2018early majority\u2019, the \u2018early\nmajority\u2019 perceive to a greater extent than the \u2018early adopters\u2019 that the following statements about solar systems\napply:\n\uf071 That they are unattractive\n\uf071 That they are unaffordable\n\uf071 That grant levels to aid the purchase are not high enough\nFurther to this, the \u2018early majority\u2019 need convincing that:\n14\n\uf071 That the systems are not too visually intrusive\n\uf071 That they are maintenance free\n\uf071 That they may add value to a property\n\uf071 That the installation of a system may not affect the visual landscape\n\uf071 That the installation process is simple and with minimal disruption\nThese perceived characteristics highlight that consumers are unlikely to adopt solar if they perceive it to affect\nthe visual landscape, and to be intrusive. Furthermore, if solar does not bring additional value for the property,\nthen adoption will not be considered by householders who may move home before the \u2018payback\u2019 period ends.\nHence, the value of solar to a property is intrinsically linked to the productivity or capital cost of systems, and if\nthese are improved, adoption should follow as more reasons for people to adopt become apparent.\nThe results of the perception study identified that the \u2018early majority\u2019 have a negative opinion of the simple\n\u2018payback\u2019 period, which is the single most important limiting factor overall. The current policy of reducing\ncapital costs through grant aid is an easy method of reducing cost, but as the Repertory Grid exercise showed,\nhouseholders consider capital cost as only one element of the purchase decision. Simple payback is determined\nby the time taken to recover the capital costs from the revenue gains that the product brings, so reducing prices\nis one side of the equation, however householders would also like to see improved productivity of the systems\nand decreasing capital prices, as the technology improves. This, coupled with generous electricity buy-backs for\nPV systems would enhance the relative advantage and provide the adopter with an income, which would in turn\nimprove the payback period (Bolinger et al.2001). Alternatively, marketing could follow a service-based\napproach, whereby suppliers install a system for a nominal charge, and energy is paid for as it is supplied. This\nconcept is compatible with previous marketing schemes that have recommended that a \u2018whole product\u2019 view be\ntaken; in this way complementary products are marketed together, for example, highly efficient electrical\nappliances with PV systems and effective insulation products with ST systems.\n6.2 Limitations within the study\nAs mentioned above, a limitation of this study is that the term \u2018solar power\u2019 is used and solar power is not\ndefined between Solar Thermal and Photovoltaics. In time, when consumers are more aware of the types of\ntechnology, this will be an area of work that should be pursued to define whether or not the two are perceived\ndifferently. This study focused specifically on attitudes to retrofitted domestic solar power systems. Other solar\nproducts are available, such roof-integrated replacement tiles, or laminate systems, which can be used for\n15\ndomestic situations. These will potentially elicit different perceptions as they both look and perform differently\nfrom the retrofit systems. However, the study was based on retrofit systems, as they are the solar power product\nthat householders in the UK are probably most familiar with.\nA further point of consideration is centred on the \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 classification, which may have been more clearly\ndefined for respondents if an \u2018opt-out\u2019 box was available in the questionnaire. Several areas for further research\nhave been identified; a conjoint analysis method could be used to determine how adopters perceive different\nsolar products, and secondly, the perspective that manufacturers and suppliers have of the systems may be\ninfluencing the marketing methods and terminology used. This in turn could be limiting adoption, as the public\ncannot relate to it. Future work could also investigate the perceptions that consumers have of small-scale\napplications of solar power systems, in particular PV, and how it might relate to large-scale application\n6.3 General conclusions and recommendations\nThe study investigated three questions:\n\uf0b7 Do the pragmatic \u2018early majority\u2019 have a sufficiently positive attitude towards the characteristics of ST and\nPV systems which relate to \u2018relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability\u2019 that indicates\nadoption will follow in the near future?\nThe answer to this question is that whilst the attitudes of \u2018early majority\u2019 consumers, in the case study area,\ntowards domestic solar power systems are largely positive, they do not hold sufficiently positive views to\ncharacteristics of the systems that cover all the innovation attributes, that suggests they will adopt the systems in\ntheir present form. If the innovation decision process is followed, the \u2018relative advantage\u2019 of the systems will\nneed to be enhanced, which will require a review of the current policies to grant aid the technology, and improve\nthe financial advantage further.\n\uf0b7 Is there a significant difference in attitude towards the characteristics of solar systems between the\ninnovative categories (referred to as the \u2018early adopters\u2019) and the later, more pragmatic householders\n(referred to as the \u2018early majority\u2019) or within the socio-economic or demographic sub-groups of the \u2018early\nmajority that would influence marketing activity?\nThe research highlighted that the \u2018early adopters\u2019 are currently adopting the systems, whereas, unless the\nattributes of solar power change, or external factors increase their \u2018relative advantage\u2019, the \u2018early majority\u2019 are\nunlikely to adopt. However, some marginal differences do exist between sub-groups within the \u2018early majority,\n16\nwhich may influence how marketing messages should be directed and delivered, at a time when solar power\nbecomes attractive to the \u2018early majority\u2019.\n\uf0b7 Is it possible to identify characteristics of solar power that may be creating the adoption \u2018chasm\u2019 as defined\nby Moore (1999)?\nThe study found that the \u2018chasm\u2019, previously considered by Moore (1999) to exist primarily in the hi-tech\nsector, is also applicable to other technologies and innovations. The barriers to the adoption of domestic solar\nsystems lie primarily with the financial aspects of the systems. However, with product development, the\neconomic, operational and aesthetic aspects could be improved and by utilising sensible marketing strategies\nthat spread awareness of the innovation and improve its observability, the potential for solar power is greatly\nenhanced.\nParticular recommendations to arise from this study are that:\n\uf0b7 Suppliers and manufacturers should work closely with the \u2018early adopters\u2019 to develop the operational,\neconomic and aesthetic aspects of the products;\n\uf0b7 Suppliers should seek to achieve greater understanding of what customers' perceptions actually are, in\norder for them to develop products that meet their needs;\n\uf0b7 Financial assessments of solar power products should be undertaken, as well as determination of the\noptimal level at which domestic solar products become attractive to current householders;\n\uf0b7 As more solar systems are fitted, further work could determine the differences between the two solar\ntechnologies, and types of product within them, such as roof integrated, replacement tiles, or laminate\nsystems:\n\uf0b7 Further work should be carried out to develop a sound theoretical base for the concept of the \u2018chasm\u2019.\n17\nReferences.\nAggarwal P., Cha T., Wilemon D.
