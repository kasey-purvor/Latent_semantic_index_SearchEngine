Disease\noutbreaks in the UK and US have illustrated that ready-to-eat crops can be a vehicle for the\ntransmission of gastrointestinal disease. Irrigation water has been implicated as a possible\nsource of microbiological contaminants. Over two thirds of irrigation water applied to UK\nsalad crops is abstracted from rivers and streams. Many of these are subject to a continuous\ninput of faecal contamination from sewage treatment works as well as intermittent inputs from\nlivestock and sewer overflows. In this paper we show how geospatial techniques can help to\nassess the relationships between treated effluent discharges and abstractions and thus provide\na new insight into local scale assessments of irrigation water quality. The extent to which the\napproach can inform risk assessments and decision-making at the farm scale is demonstrated\nusing a case study catchment in eastern England.\nKeywords: abstraction; catchment; GIS; risk assessment; salads; sewage.\nIntroduction\nIn England, consumer demands are changing, with a shift towards foods that are more healthy,\nquick and convenient to prepare. One sector that has grown rapidly in recent years is pre-\nprepared bagged salads. Between 2005 and 2007, national retail sales of mixed and single leaf\nbagged salads increased by 9%, with market research showing a strong underlying growth in\nconsumer demand (Mintel, 2009). This demand for salads and other so-called ready to eat\n3(RTE) crops such as salad onions, radishes, spinach, and culinary herbs has had a major\nimpact on the horticultural industry and particularly on water abstraction. For all these crops\nirrigation is an essential component of production and a high value use of water (irrigation\nbenefits per unit applied, \u00a3\/m3), helping to maximise quality in terms of colour, size, shape,\nskin finish and taste (Knox et al., 2000). But the reliance on irrigation water brings with it the\npotential to be a source of contaminants. As salads are not cooked prior to eating it is critical\nthat production practices ensure that the potential for contamination with hazards to public\nhealth, such as infectious microorganisms, is reduced to a tolerable level. Both horticultural\ngrowers and retailers are concerned regarding the potential food safety risks associated with\nusing water of low microbiological quality on crops that are not processed prior to human\nconsumption. A study for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) concluded that although water\nused in agriculture in the UK may be a contributory factor in some food-poisoning incidents,\nit is not possible to quantify the extent of the problem (Groves et al., 2002). However,\nepidemiological and risk-assessment studies elsewhere have indicated the existence of risks\nassociated with the consumption of salads that have been irrigated with poor quality water\n(Shuval et al., 1997; Blumenthal et al., 2000; Hamilton et al., 2000; Petterson et al., 2001;\nStine et al., 2005).\nIn 2003, a survey of irrigation practices within the RTE crop sector was conducted as part of a\nUK study to assess microbiological risks associated with irrigation water quality (Tyrrel et al.,\n2006). That study collated information on the types of salads grown, the areas irrigated, and\nwater sources used via a postal survey of registered horticultural holdings. It found that\nlettuces accounted for half the total cropped area, whilst spinach and salad onions accounted\nfor a further third (32%). Survey data was also used to correlate irrigation water source\nagainst area, by crop type (Table 1). This showed that surface water (rivers and streams)\naccounted for 70-90% of all water abstracted for irrigating lettuce, spinach, salad onions and\ncelery in England. These industry figures are consistent with national government statistics,\n4which showed that 65% of all irrigation abstractions are from surface sources with relatively\nlittle storage (Weatherhead and Knox, 2000). In general terms, river water would be expected\nto have the greatest faecal contamination compared to other water sources (Figure 1). This is\nbecause of the continuous discharge of sewage treatment works (STW) effluent into the\nwatercourses and inputs from intermittent sources of faecal contamination, such as run off\nfrom livestock farms and discharges from combined sewer outfalls, associated with run off\nfollowing heavy rainfall events. River water is thus the most commonly used source for\nirrigating salads and the source most likely to be contaminated with hazardous\nmicroorganisms. The response of salad producers to this threat needs to demonstrate due\ndiligence and be proportionate to the risk posed. However, the industry survey in 2003\nhighlighted a limited and uncertain response to this microbiological hazard (Tyrrel et al.,\n2006). Typically, monitoring of the microbiological quality of the irrigation water was limited\nto annual tests on source water. The results were stored for reference or to demonstrate\nconformity to current grower protocol requirements but had no specific operational role.\nMany growers reported being unclear as to how to interpret microbiological water quality data\nin the absence of water quality guidelines. The development of risk assessments for irrigation\nabstraction points was not commonplace. Many growers referred to the lack of practical\nguidance to assist them in making rational decisions with regard to monitoring and managing\ntheir irrigation water quality. In response to the identified need for better guidance the\nHorticultural Development Council launched their \u201cKeeping it clean\u201d campaign in 2005 to\nprovide generic practical advice to growers on avoiding microbial contamination in salad\nproduction.\nAcademics and practitioners working in the field of catchment assessment and planning will\nbe familiar with the routine use of sophisticated catchment-scale river water quality\nsimulation models such as SIMCAT (Crabtree et al., 2009). Whereas modelling approaches\nfor chemical pollutants such as nutrients have been the subject of much investment and\n5development over many years, Kay et al. (2009) describe modelling approaches for faecal\nindicator organisms (FIO) as being in their infancy. Models capable of evaluating the delivery\nof FIO to designated waters such as bathing or shellfish harvesting areas are needed to ensure\ncompliance with the Water Framework Directive (Council of the European Union, 2000) and\nsubsidiary EU legislation such as the Bathing Water Directive (Council of the European\nUnion, 2006). Kay et al. (2007, 2009) also highlight in particular the need for tools capable of\nassessing the relative magnitude of inputs from continuous inputs (principally sewage) and\nintermittent inputs driven by rainfall events (e.g. from agriculture). The authors illustrate the\napplication of their latest screening tool which combines water quality, hydrological and land\ncover data to predict FIO concentrations in river water discharging to the sea in England and\nWales.\nWhilst FIO modelling approaches such as those described above are essential for river basin\nplanning in support of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, as a tool they\nare inappropriate for individual abstractors confronted with the challenge of assessing\nirrigation water quality risks at the farm-scale. In this paper we assess the potential benefit of\nusing data and maps to combine locally relevant geospatial information to aid this risk\nassessment process. The paper focuses on a catchment in eastern England where irrigated\nproduction using surface water is concentrated and where a large number of STW discharges\ncontribute to local river flows. A description of the datasets and mapping, and discussion of\nthe future role of geospatial techniques to support risk assessment and management of\nirrigation water quality at the farm level, is provided.\nMethodology\nIn summary, the spatial distribution of irrigation abstraction points have been mapped and\nanalysed in relation to the location of sewage treatment works (STW) discharges using a\nGeographical Information System (GIS, Arcview v9.2). The Environment Agency (EA)\n6Anglian Region was chosen as a study area as it is experiencing major population growth and\na rising demand for water, particularly for public water supply and irrigation (EA, 2008a).\nGeo-referenced datasets containing information on abstractions and discharges were obtained\nfrom the EA. At a regional level, this assessment helped to identify catchments where there\nwas a large concentration of discharge and irrigation abstraction points. A catchment was then\nidentified and used as the basis for conducting a more detailed local scale assessment.\nAll abstractions from surface and groundwater for spray irrigation in England and Wales\nrequire a licence from the EA under the Water Resources Act (1991). The licensed and\nabstracted volumes for irrigation together with supplementary information (location, water\nsource, peak rates) for each licence are recorded by the EA within their national abstraction\nlicensing database (NALD). For this study, data for 2008 were used. The abstraction licensing\ndata were processed, imported into the GIS and mapped to show the spatial distribution of\nirrigation abstraction licences, classified by licensed volume.\nIn order to protect the environment, water quality and human health, the EA are required by\nlegislation to regulate the quality and quantity of discharges in England and Wales. All\ndischarges, whether from sewage or trade effluent, to surface water, such as rivers, streams,\ncanals, groundwater or the sea, require a \u2018consent to discharge\u2019. Information on the licensed\nvolumes for all discharge consents in EA Anglian Region for 2008 were obtained. This\nincluded all agricultural, waste, landfill, trade and sewage discharges. The data were screened\nto exclude discharge consents relating to activities other than sewage treatment works (either\nfinal or treated effluent) from water companies. As before, the data were processed, imported\ninto the GIS, classified by licensed volume, and mapped to show the spatial distribution of\nSTW discharges across EA Anglian Region.\nThe above GIS analyses were useful for identifying \u2018hotspots\u2019 at a regional level where\nirrigation abstractions and discharges are concentrated. From this, a catchment was chosen to\n7conduct further analysis. The distance between an irrigation abstraction point and the nearest\nupstream sewage treatment works discharge point was then selected as a geospatial metric to\nindicate the potential risk of a specific abstraction point to poor microbiological quality. In\nEngland and Wales, the EA have defined 126 catchments as part of their Catchment\nAbstraction Management Strategy (CAMS) process which sets out how much water is\navailable in each catchment and how it will be managed (EA, 2008b). Using the GIS, a\ncomparison between surface water irrigation abstractions and STW discharges, in terms of\nnumber and licensed volume, by catchment, was completed (Table 2). From this, the Upper\nOuse and Bedford Ouse catchment was selected due to its relatively small area, and high\ndensity of irrigation abstraction and STW discharge points. Each catchment is comprised of a\nnumber of water resource management units (WRMU) or sub-catchments. For this study, a\nWRMU was chosen which included the Flit and Ivel Rivers in Bedfordshire, where there are\nreported to be 180 licensed abstractions, with almost half licensed for public water supply.\nThe other dominant use is for spray irrigation, mainly for horticultural crops (EA, 2005). In\nwater resource terms, this WRMU is defined as having \u2018no water available\u2019 implying that\nthere is no water available for further licensing at low flows although water may be available\nat higher flows with appropriate restrictions. It is precisely this combination of low river\nflows during the summer months coinciding with peak demands for spray irrigation that\ncreates potential health risks in catchments where RTE crops are grown and irrigated.\nUsing the GIS, the NALD data were analysed to identify irrigation abstractions within the\nWRMU. The data were screened to exclude abstractions from sources other than surface\nwater. This dataset was overlaid onto a digitised river network dataset (1:50000) for the sub-\ncatchment, part of a national hydrological dataset held by the Centre for Ecology and\nHydrology (CEH). Similarly, the locations of all STW discharges were overlaid onto the river\nnetwork. A map showing the location of each irrigation abstraction point and STW discharge\npoint within the catchment along the river network was produced.\n8When considering microbiological risks for irrigation abstraction, it is also important to know\nelevational differences so that only discharges upstream from an abstraction point are\nconsidered. The final stage involved developing a digital elevation model (DEM) for the\ncatchment in order to estimate the elevation for each STW discharge outfall and abstraction\npoint. The DEM was produced using a gridded (raster) dataset derived by UCL and Mimas\nusing interferometric techniques on the ERS 1 and ERS 2 satellite data and held in the\nLandmap Data Archive at a grid resolution of 25m. Using a GIS \u2018distance to point\u2019 algorithm,\nthe minimum river distance from each abstraction point to the nearest upstream STW\ndischarge outfall was calculated.\nResults\nThe spatial distribution of irrigation abstraction licences across EA Anglian Region is shown\nin Figure 2. The map highlights catchments where licensed volumetric demand is\nconcentrated, notably in parts of Cambridgeshire, the Fens, north Lincolnshire, east Suffolk\nand north Norfolk. These correspond to known areas of intense horticultural production. In\n2008, it was reported that there were 1173 horticultural holdings in EA Anglian Region and\n40% of these were engaged in growing field-scale vegetables, including RTE crops (Knox et\nal., 2010). The analysis shows that there are nearly 3300 irrigation abstraction licences, with a\ntotal annual licensed volume of 123 x 106 m3 (Table 2). The difference between the number of\nindustry registered horticultural holdings and abstraction licenses is because farms have more\nthan one abstraction appoint to cater for rotational cropping. The analysis also shows that only\na quarter (25%) of the total licensed volume is abstracted, even in a dry year such as 2003.\nThe spatial distribution of STWs across Anglian Region is shown in Figure 2. As expected,\nthere are many small discharge consents (<2000 m3 day-1), but also a notable number of very\nlarge discharges (>20000 m3 day-1) associated with major towns and conurbations in the\nregion. Overall, the analysis shows there are approximately 14000 discharge consents, with a\n9total annual licensed dry weather flow (DWF), that is the combined flow (foul water and\nsurface water) in dry weather conditions of 608 x 106 m3 year-1, equivalent to approximately\nfive times the licensed volume for irrigation (Table 2).\nFor the Upper Ouse and Bedford Ouse catchment, the location of each irrigation abstraction\npoint relative to STW discharges along the river network was mapped (Figure 3). The GIS\nanalysis identified 61 irrigation abstraction points and 57 discharge consents, of which 13\nwere for STW effluent discharge. Of the 61 irrigation abstractions, 43 were downstream from\none or more STW discharge outfalls. Finally, the proportion of irrigation abstraction points in\na catchment that are within a given distance of an upstream STW in the catchment was\ncalculated (Figure 4). From this, it was deduced that 50% of irrigation abstractions are within\n4500m of an upstream STW outfall, and furthermore a quarter are less than 2500m from an\nupstream STW discharge outfall. These baseline statistics reinforce the need to develop\nappropriate risk assessment procedures to deal with abstractions of low quality irrigation\nwater at the farm level.\nDiscussion\nFarm level risk assessment and management\nThe analysis described in this paper uses public domain data and processes it using GIS\ntechniques such that the outputs may be presented in a useful visual format to inform water\nquality assessments. Although the regulatory authority (EA) publishes interactive catchment\nmaps on their website for use by the general public, it is not possible to obtain aggregate\ncatchment statistics on discharges or irrigation abstractions. We suggest that from the\nperspective of a technical manager involved in agri-food production needing to risk assess\nirrigated RTE crop production, the availability of maps and data such as the examples given\nin Figures 3 and 4would be a useful step forward. These data could, for example, permit a\npreliminary, risk-based classification of abstraction points for agribusinesses operating in the\n10\ncatchment. Abstraction locations for which there is no upstream discharge point could be\nclassified as \u2018low risk\u2019 and those in close proximity to discharge points would receive a\nhigher risk classification. However, as discussed earlier, basing risk assessment classes solely\non proximity to sewage discharge points would be a crude metric. By integrating additional\ndata on river discharges into the GIS, dilution factors could be estimated and taken into\naccount. The use of remote sensed land cover data could also highlight agricultural sources of\nfaecal contamination, and locations of sewer overflows. Future augmentation and refinement\nof this methodology should not however lose sight of the needs of the user for a decision-\nsupport tool that is readily interpretable by an individual who is not a water quality specialist.\nThe key is in ensuring that a sensible balance is struck between collating information at the\ncatchment level (e.g. river discharge, land use) and providing useful data and maps that\ncombine a variety of parameters for interpretation at the farm level (abstraction point).\nGeospatial analyses such as this have the potential to complement broader water quality\nmonitoring and risk management decision making. Current water quality monitoring by\nabstractors is of limited spatial and temporal resolution (Tyrrel et al., 2006). Intuitively, one\nmight argue that increased monitoring could render a catchment assessment redundant \u2013 if\nmonitoring is conducted more frequently, abstraction points could be classified on the basis of\nactual data rather than assumptions derived from geospatial information on upstream\ndischarges and land use. However, monitoring is expensive and particularly challenging if the\nhigh magnitude in variability of FIO concentrations in rivers is to be accurately assessed\n(Fremaux et al., 2008). Researchers have repeatedly shown a consistent association between\nhigh flow events in UK rivers and elevated FIO concentrations (Kay et al., 2009). Rather than\nrely on reactive and costly monitoring, the development of a geospatial approach supports a\nmore proactive catchment risk assessment more akin to the Water Safety Plans advocated by\nthe World Health Organisation for managing drinking water quality from catchment to\nconsumer (WHO, 2005). The frequency of water quality monitoring could be informed by the\n11\nrisk classification of abstraction points \u2013 higher risk sites should be monitored more\nfrequently whereas baseline monitoring may be acceptable for less risky sites. Monitoring\ndata would help to validate the risk-based classification generated by the GIS.\nOnce abstraction points have been classified on a risk-based scale, appropriate risk\nmanagement decisions may then be considered. Options worthy of consideration include the\nmatching of non-salad crops with more risky abstraction points; switching technologies from\noverhead to micro (drip) irrigation to help reduce\/eliminate contact between the irrigation\nwater and the crop surfaces; the prescription of minimum defined intervals between irrigation\nwith low quality water and crop harvest, and investment in water storage and water treatment\ntechnologies.\nMethodological limitations\nThe approach outlined in this scoping study has a number of limitations which must be\nrecognised. The EA NALD dataset provides information on the location of individual licensed\nabstractions for irrigation. However, even in a dry year, less than a third of all water licensed\nfor irrigation in England is actually abstracted, for a variety of reasons. For example, in some\ncatchments the water may not be available for abstraction when needed due to low river flows\nor low aquifer levels. The nature of rotational cropping also means that in each year the\nlocation of abstraction points vis a viz the fields being irrigated may not be suitable. Further\nwork is thus required to refine the mapping of abstraction points, to consider only those that\nare actually used each year.\nImproved knowledge of the field locations where RTE crops are grown is also needed. The\ncurrent approach ignores the composition of land use in the catchment and hence it is difficult\nto screen those abstraction points which are in close proximity to STW discharge outfalls\n(\u2018high risk\u2019) and being used for irrigating RTE crops. This could be undertaken using high\n12\nresolution remote sensing imagery to generate maps showing the spatial distribution of RTE\ncrops at both farm and catchment levels.\nInformation on the rates and timing of abstraction would also be needed for each abstraction\npoint. Depending on flow characteristics, abstractors are required to record peak rates (usually\ndaily, but sometimes hourly or absolute) to comply with licence conditions. Coupling this\nwith data on the timings of abstraction would help to identify how peak rates of water\nabstraction compare against river flows and likely FIO concentrations.\nThe assumption that proximity to an upstream discharge inevitably leads to abstracted water\nbeing of low quality is too simplistic. It is known that pathogens such as Escherichia coli\nO157:H7 have the ability to survive in river water for weeks which suggests that viable cells\nmay travel significant distances from the point of discharge (Avery et al., 2008). However, the\noutputs presented in this paper need to be used as an indicator of potential risk and interpreted\nintelligently. The water discharged from a sewage treatment works is not necessarily of poor\nmicrobiological quality. The technologies employed by sewage treatment operators vary and\nsome are more efficient in pathogen removal than others. Furthermore, the concentrations of\npathogens reaching a downstream abstraction point are influenced by factors such as ambient\nweather conditions, dilution, natural die-off, and time of travel. None of these processes are\ncurrently considered in the current geospatial approach, but some could be usefully integrated,\nnotwithstanding the need to maintain ease of use.\nFinally, there is the issue regarding visual representation of complex data. The sophisticated\ngraphics and visualisation capabilities of modern GIS software can generate highly\nconvincing outputs, whilst concealing spatial modelling and interpretation errors (Knox et al.,\n1999). Map outputs can of course be extremely useful, particularly for identifying water\nrelated issues that have temporal and spatial dimensions, but care must be taken to ensure that\n13\nthe GIS capability is used to reveal what is known rather than conceal the assumptions and\nuncertainty underlying a coloured map.\nConclusions\nThis scoping study considers the key issues in developing a simple yet robust framework in\nsupport of risk assessing the microbiological quality of water for irrigation abstraction at the\nfarm level. At present there is a noticeable gap between what is currently undertaken at the\ncatchment scale to understand the dynamics of land and water management on the\nmicrobiological quality of water resources and its various uses downstream, and the specific\nrequirements for individual abstractors concerned with the quality of their water abstractions.\nThe study demonstrates how it is possible to combine datasets using a geospatial approach to\nassess the relative risks of faecal contamination at different abstraction locations, although\nfurther information on land use, stream flows, and actual discharge are needed to provide a\nmore detailed picture.\nAcknowledgement\nWe acknowledge the Environment Agency (Anglian Region) for provision of spray irrigation\nlicensed abstraction and sewage treatment discharge data.\nReferences\nAvery, L.M., Williams, A.P., Killham, K., and Jones, D.L.
