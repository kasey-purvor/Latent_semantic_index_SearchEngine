However, the issues are complex,\nand recent reviews have emphasised the need for new approaches\nto understanding the ecology and evolution of communities [9\u2013\n11]. Two important emerging themes are (i) the effects of adaptive\ntrait variation at one trophic level upon other levels [1,2,5,12,13]\nand (ii) the roles of evolutionary history and phylogenetically\nconserved traits in determining current community structure\n[4,11,14,16].\nHere we address these issues in a study that focuses on diverse,\nclearly defined communities of parasitoid wasps attacking insect\nherbivore hosts. Understanding the processes structuring host\u2013\nparasitoid communities is important because parasitoid wasps and\ntheir insect hosts comprise about one-third of all animal species,\nand more than 50% of all terrestrial animal species [17].\nParasitoids also play a major role in regulating populations of\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\ntheir insect hosts, and the ecosystem service they provide in\nreducing losses to herbivores and stored product pests is estimated\nat billions of dollars annually [1,2,8,15,16]. Detailed studies of\nsingle insect host species have shown that variation in host traits,\nincluding feeding location, feeding mode, and host plant species\n[1,2,15,16], influences the mortality imposed by parasitoids.\nHowever, much less is known of the effects of host trait evolution\non parasitoid community composition [5,18]. Addressing this issue\nrequires examination of patterns in parasitoid communities across\nhost species, and because related host species may share both\nsimilar traits and parasitoid communities through shared common\nancestry [19,20], this in turn requires explicit consideration of host\nphylogeny.\nWe studied the parasitoid wasp communities associated with a\nmajor radiation of herbivorous insects\u2014cynipid gallwasps (Hyme-\nnoptera, Cynipidae) on oak trees (Quercus species)\u2014a host taxon with\nsome 1,000 herbivore species, distributed primarily in northern\ntemperate regions [24]. These communities are excellent test\nsubjects because they are diverse and well studied [21\u201329], and the\nvast majority of the associated parasitoids attack only oak\ngallwasps [21,22,24,30,31]. The communities are thus ecologically\n\u2018\u2018closed\u2019\u2019 and may meaningfully be considered in isolation.\nOak gallwasps induce the development of spectacular galls\n(Figures 1 and S2), which though comprising plant tissues represent\nthe extended phenotypes of gallwasp genes [23,32]. Parasitoids\ninflict high mortality on their gallwasp hosts [24,27,28,33], and\nselection should favour adaptive host traits that reduce parasitism\n[27,34]. Since all parasitoid attack involves oviposition through gall\ntissues, gallwasp genes that induce gall structures that reduce\nparasitoid attack rates should be favoured by selection\u2014a view\nencapsulated in the Enemy Hypothesis [1,2,27,33]. This hypothesis\nis supported by studies of the impact of variation in gall morphology\nwithin galler species, and is also compatible with demonstrated\nconvergent evolution of several of the same traits (Table 1) in\ngallwasps [23\u201326]. These defensive extended phenotypes drive\nreciprocal phenotype evolution [34,35] in parasitoid traits, such as\novipositor length, which may limit access to concealed gallwasp\nhosts [31]. While previous studies have examined the role of other\nhost defences (such as warning coloration and cuticular coatings of\nhair or spines (e.g., [5]) and grooming behaviours [36]), we here\nexamine the impact of diversity in extended phenotypes in\npredicting variation in parasitoid community structure among a\nclosely related group of herbivores.\nBecause the parasitoid communities attacking oak gallwasps\ncomprise both specialists (those attacking a small subset of\navailable host gall types) and generalists (those attacking many\nhost gall types) [21,22,24,28,30,31], we can also ask which of these\ngroups drive any host-associated community structure. This is\nimportant because whereas changes in host traits influencing\nspecialist enemies are likely to influence only a small number of\nspecies in these foodwebs, those influencing vulnerability to attack\nby generalists may have both major direct and indirect (apparent\ncompetition [9]) influences on many species in the web. Further,\nAskew [22] predicted that the richness of oak gallwasp\ncommunities would be maintained by partitioning of generalist\nparasitoids among different gall phenotypes.\nWe emphasise two key phases in successful parasitoid attack\u2014\nhost detection and host exploitation [1,2,15,16,34]. For parasitoids\nof herbivorous insects, host detection requires searching the right\npart of the right plant at the right time, while exploitation involves\novercoming any host defences and the ability to develop on the\nhost resources available [15,16,34]. We can, in turn, divide host\ntraits into three major groups (Table 1), each of which has been\ninvoked repeatedly [1,2,5,15,16,19,21,22,27,30,34] as a key\ndeterminant of parasitoid community structure: (i) Spatiotemporal\nniche traits describe the distribution of hosts in space (oak taxon\ngalled, location of the gall on the oak) and time (season and\nduration of development), and determine the likelihood of\ndetection by parasitoids. (ii) Resource traits represent the quality\nof the host resource per gall (host size, number of hosts per gall)\npotentially available to parasitoids. (iii) Gall morphology traits\ncapture variation in the structure of gall tissues parasitoids must\npenetrate to access host resources, potentially acting as direct\ndefences against particular natural enemies (the Enemy Hypoth-\nesis [27,33]). These three groups of traits influence parasitoid\nsuccess in host detection (spatiotemporal niche) and host\nexploitation (resource, morphology), respectively.\nHere we compare the parasitoid communities induced by 40\ngallwasp species (Table S1) at five replicate sites across Hungary\n(Figure S1), a known ancient centre of oak cynipid diversity\n[37,38]. Oak gallwasp lifecycles involve obligate alternation\nbetween a spring sexual generation and a summer asexual\ngeneration [24,39], each of which induces a gall with a\ncharacteristic morphology that develops on a characteristic plant\norgan (e.g., bud, leaf, flower, fruit, root) of a specific oak taxon\n[23\u201326]. Exemplar gall phenotypes are shown in Figure 1, and gall\nmorphologies and character states for all species and generations\nare shown in Figure S2 and Table S2. Sexual and asexual gallwasp\ngenerations have long been known to support different parasitoid\ncommunities [21,22,28,40], a feature of gallwasp ecology that here\nwe establish quantitatively in ancient refuge communities for the\nfirst time. Because the two generations of the gallwasp lifecycle also\nshow independent evolution of morphological traits, gall locations\nand host oak associations [23,25,26,41], we examine patterns in\nassociated parasitoid communities in each generation separately.\nSpecifically, we ask whether similar parasitoid communities evolve\non hosts with similar gall morphology traits (as predicted by the\nEnemy Hypothesis), on hosts occupying similar spatiotemporal\nniches, or on hosts providing similar levels of resource per gall.\nFurther, we ask whether any host-associated community structure\nis driven by the preferences of generalist natural enemies, as\npredicted by Askew [22].\nAuthor Summary\nHerbivorous insects, such as the wasps that induce trees to\nmake galls, and the parasitoids that attack (and ultimately\nkill) the wasps comprise about a third of all animal species,\nbut it remains unclear what determines the structure of\nthese complex coevolving communities. Here, we analyzed\n48 parasitoid communities attacking different cynipid\nwasps that live and feed on oak trees. These communities\nare diverse and \u2018\u2018closed,\u2019\u2019 with each centered upon the\ncharacteristic gall induced by a given cynipid wasp species.\nThe often spectacular and complex galls are extended\nphenotypes of gallwasp genes and have been suggested\nto evolve as gallwasp defenses against their parasitoid\nenemies\u2014\u2018\u2018the Enemy Hypothesis.\u2019\u2019 Our analysis showed\nthat similar parasitoid communities occurred on galls with\nsimilar structural traits (e.g., toughness, hairiness, sticki-\nness), supporting the Enemy Hypothesis. We also found\nsimilar communities on galls that co-occur frequently in\ntime and space; in particular, those occurring on the same\noak species and same plant organ (e.g., leaf, bud, seed).\nOur results suggest that cynipid wasps might escape\nparticular parasitoids via evolutionary shifts in the struc-\nture or location of their galls. However, escape may often\nbe transient due to recruitment of new enemies already\nattacking other host galls with similar trait combinations.\nHost Traits Structure Parasitoid Communities\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\nA key issue in analyses of patterns across species is the fact that\nhost trait values (both gall phenotypes and associated parasitoid\ncommunities) cannot be regarded as statistically independent, but\nare linked by phylogenetic patterns of shared common ancestry\n[5,18,19,23,25,36,41,42]. To assess the strength of any phyloge-\nnetic patterning in variables of interest, we generated a molecular\nphylogeny of the host gallwasp species (see Materials and\nMethods), and then used matrix correlation analyses (MCA; see\nMaterials and Methods) to test the significance of correlations\nbetween pairwise genetic distance between species, and pairwise\nsimilarity in phenotypic and community traits. We then use two\nparallel approaches that control for phylogenetic nonindepen-\ndence to examine patterns within each generation (see Materials\nand Methods). First, we included host relatedness (shown visually\nin Figure 2) as a covariate in MCA of host traits and parasitoid\ncommunities. Second, we controlled for phylogenetic noninde-\npendence using phylogenetically independent contrasts in phylo-\ngenetic regression analysis (PRA) [42]. We present results\nseparately for each of our five study sites, and for all five sites\npooled (see Materials and Methods). We predict that host traits\nwith a key role in structuring parasitoid communities should have\nconsistent significant effects across these different datasets.\nResults\nSexual and Asexual Gallwasp Generations Support\nSignificantly Different Communities\nWe reared over 40,000 cynipid galls, resulting in .31,000\nparasitoids belonging to 58 species (Table S3). Each gall type was\nattacked by between three and 30 parasitoid species, of varying host\nspecificity. For the purposes of illustration (and not for data analysis),\nwe divide parasitoid species among the following categories. There\nwere nine extreme specialist parasitoid species (recorded from only\none host gall type), 23 specialists (two to 11 hosts), 16 generalists (11\u2013\n21 hosts), and nine extreme generalists (.20 hosts) (Table S3). Our\nplacement of parasitoid species into these categories closely matches\nprevious work on Western Palaearctic oak gall communities\n[21,22,24,43]. To allow tests of correlations between host\nphenotypic traits and parasitoid community composition, we\ncalculated the pairwise similarity in parasitoid community compo-\nsition for all gall type pairs using Bray-Curtis scores. This common\nmeasure of similarity takes account of both the presence and the\nrelative abundance of parasitoid species (see Materials and\nMethods), and for our sampled communities ranged from 0% (no\nparasitoid species in common) to 80% (great overlap of species).

This replicates Askew\u2019s findings for\nyounger and much less diverse postglacial oak gallwasp communi-\nties in the UK [21], and is consistent with a fundamental role for\nseason of development in determining parasitoid community\ncomposition (see also [16]).\nPhenotypic Traits and Parasitoid Communities Are\nStrongly Correlated with Host Phylogeny\nParasitoid community composition and all three aspects of host\nphenotypes (spatiotemporal niche, host resource availability, gall\nmorphology) are correlated with host phylogeny (Figures 2 and 3;\nTable 2). More closely related gallwasp hosts harboured more\nsimilar parasitoid communities in both sexual (p,0.05, pooled sites)\nand asexual generations (p,0.001, and significant at p,0.05 in four\nof five individual sites). Significant correlations were also always\npositive for spatiotemporal traits (plant organ galled, oak taxon, and\ngall persistence) and host resource availability (host size, Table 2). In\ncontrast, signs of significant correlations varied among morpholog-\nical traits; they were positive for toughness and gall size but negative\nfor spininess, stickiness, and presence of an internal airspace. The\nnegative correlations for the latter traits are consistent with previous\nanalyses demonstrating their convergent evolution in gallwasps\n[23,26]. A greater number of significant correlations was found in\nthe asexual generation galls (Table 2), in part reflecting the greater\ntrait diversity present in this generation (Figure S2; Table S2). These\nresults underline the need to control for phylogenetic nonindepen-\ndence in testing correlations between host traits and parasitoid\ncommunity composition, even in closely related hosts.\nGall Defences, Spatiotemporal Niche, and Resource\nAvailability Each Structure Parasitoid Communities\nSummaries of the significant variables retained in MCA and\nPRA analyses are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. While\nMCAs addressed overall similarity in community composition\nusing untransformed Bray Curtis similarities, in PRAs we used\nmultidimensional scaling (MDS) to identify three statistically\nindependent axes of community variation (see Materials and\nMethods). The results of the two analytical approaches are highly\ncongruent and show parasitoid community composition to be\ninfluenced by host traits associated with each of gall morphology,\nspatiotemporal niche, and host resource (Tables 3 and 4).\nExplanatory power of these traits in combination can be high: in\nPRA, these groups of explanatory variables explained up to 62%\nof the deviance in a given MDS axis (Table 4). For some site and\ngeneration combinations, however, available host species allowed\nvery few independent contrasts, limiting the degrees of freedom\navailable for detection of patterns in the data (see legend, Table 4).\n(i) Gall morphology. We obtained significant correlations\nwith parasitoid community composition for putatively defensive\ngall structure traits (Tables 3 and 4): gall hairiness (MCA and\nPRA), gall size (MCA and PRA), gall toughness (PRA), gall\nspininess (MCA), and gall stickiness (MCA). All but one of the\nsignificant correlations were obtained for parasitoid communities\nattacking the more structurally complex and diverse asexual\ngeneration galls (see Figure 1). Significance in two or more\nindividual site datasets was revealed for gall hairiness (PRA: three\nsites), gall toughness (PRA: two sites), and gall size (MCA: two\nsites). Our results thus show that gall traits of demonstrated\ndefensive value within galler species also influence parasitoid\ncommunity structure among species, and so support the Enemy\nHypothesis for gall structural diversity.\n(ii) Spatiotemporal niche traits. Host oak section had the\nmost consistently significant impact on parasitoid community\ncomposition of any single host trait, with significant correlations\nTable 1. Summary of host characters used as explanatory variables in analyses of parasitoid community composition.\nVariable Category Type Character Variation\nGall hairiness Morphology Binary Galls either have a smooth or hairy (defensive) surface. Labile.\nGall spininess Morphology Binary Galls are either spineless or covered with spines (defensive). Labile.\nGall toughness Morphology Categorical Four levels, increasing in toughness from 1 to 4. High toughness is defensive. Labile.\nGall stickiness Morphology Binary Galls are either coated with sticky resin (defensive) or not. Labile.\nGall internal airspace Morphology Binary Galls are either solid or have an internal airspace surrounding the larval chamber (defensive). Labile.\nHost gall size Morphology Continuous The volume of each mature gall type, with gall inducer larval chamber subtracted.\nHost resource size Resource availability Continuous The volume of each fully developed host gallwasp larva.\nGall locularity Resource availability Binary Galls either contain a single host gallwasp larva, or .1. Labile.\nMean number of hosts\/gall Resource availability Continuous Mean number of parasitoids emerging from galls producing at least one parasitoid.\nOrgan galled Spatiotemporal niche Categorical Gall location on the oak host, either shoot bud, dormant bud on the trunk (lenticel), acorn, leaf, catkin,\nor shoot. Labile.\nOak section Spatiotemporal niche Binary Galls develop either on oaks in the section Cerris (Q. cerris) or in the section Quercus (Q. petraea, Q.\npubescens, and Q. robur)a. Labile.\nSeason of development Spatiotemporal niche Continuous The week, starting at April 1st, that the gall was first observed to start development.\nPersistence Spatiotemporal niche Continuous The mean duration of gall development, in weeks.\nSample size Sampling effort Continuous Total number of parasitoids emerging from galls of a given type.\nThese are categorised as describing gall morphology, host resource availability, or gall spatiotemporal niche. Character states for all gall types are given in Table S2. Gall\nmorphology character states were defined as defensive on the basis of their demonstrated efficacy in single species studies [27,34]. Categorical characters with many\nstate changes in our species set [21,23\u201325,41,43] provide multiple independent contrasts and are labelled as labile.\naPlease see Material and Methods for justification of classifying oak hosts at the section rather than species level.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pbio.1000179.t001\nHost Traits Structure Parasitoid Communities\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 4 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\nfor both generations in MCA, and for three individual site asexual\ngeneration analyses in both MCA and PRA (Tables 3 and 4). The\nlocation of the host gall within the oak (leaf, bud, acorn, etc.) was\nalso significant in both generations, and in two individual site\nasexual generation analyses in both MCA and PRA. Host gall\npersistence (MCA for sexual generation galls) and season of\ndevelopment (MCA for asexual generation galls, and for one\nindividual site asexual generation PRA) had significant but less\ngeneral impacts on community structure.\n(iii) Host resource traits. Neither analytical approach\nrevealed significant correlations between host resource size and\ncommunity composition in either generation. In contrast,\naggregation of hosts (as measured by the variables locularity and\nhosts\/gall; Tables 3 and 4) influenced community structure in both\ngenerations.\nHost Gall Traits Influence the Relative Impacts of\nGeneralist Parasitoids\nAskew [22] proposed that structuring of rich cynipid-centred\ncommunities would be mediated by variation in the ability of\ngeneralist parasitoids to exploit different host phenotypes. Our data\nshow that the relative dominance (seeMaterials andMethods) of the\nfive most generalist species attacking each gallwasp generation\nvaries with host traits (Figure 4). For example, in the sexual\ngeneration gall communities, the parasitoid Aulogymnus gallarum\n(Eulophidae; 23 recorded host gall types) was a dominant parasitoid\nof catkin galls (38.5% of all parasitoid emergence), but was rare\n(,6%) or absent in galls developing in any other location. Similarly,\nit was a dominant sexual generation parasitoid of hosts on section\nQuercus oaks (40.1%), but was much rarer in hosts on section Cerris.\nReversals in the relative importance of parasitoid species pairs\nacross sexual gall locations can also be seen for Megastigmus dorsalis\n(Torymidae) and Sycophila biguttata (Eurytomidae). A similar and\nmore pronounced pattern is seen in the asexual generation galls:\neach of the five gall locations represented in our sampling was\ndominated by a different generalist parasitoid (Figure 4), and the\nrelative ranks of these parasitoids differed across hosts in the oak\nsections Cerris and Quercus. Where sampled gall types allow similar\ndominance analyses to be made in individual sites, the observed\npatterns are concordant with those across the pooled data. These\nresults are consistent with Askew\u2019s hypothesis.\nDiscussion\nPrevious multispecies studies of communities centred on\nherbivorous insects have shown that a range of host traits structure\nparasitoid assemblages, including food plant taxon [18,20,44\u201350],\nhost feeding niche (e.g., exposed versus leaf mining versus gall\ninducing; [18,48,50\u201354]), season of development [50,55,56],\nduration of gall development [55], and intrinsic (i.e., direct\nbehavioural and morphological) defences against parasitoid attack\n[5,57,58]. The relationships we find between host spatiotemporal\nniche traits and parasitoid community composition further\nstrengthen several of these patterns. The strong separation\nbetween communities attacking spring (sexual) and summer\n(asexual) gallwasp generations parallels similar phenology-associ-\nated community structure in other concealed hosts, including gall\nmidges [55] and leaf miners [50], as does the impact of host plant\ntaxon [18,48,50]. The significance of gall location independent of\nhost plant taxon parallels similar findings in communities attacking\ngalling sawflies on willows [18]. Our findings that host aggregation\n(multilocularity, hosts per gall) influences community structure\nwhile host resource size does not also parallels findings in other\nsystems [5]. The generality of these patterns implies that\nphenological matching commonly dictates the pool of available\nparasitoid species, whereas the location of hosts within specific\nplant taxa dictates which subset of this pool has appropriate\nsearching behaviours to detect them [1,2,15,16,44\u201347]. Our\nfindings suggest that species interactions, such as resource\ncompetition and multiparasitism among parasitoid species\n[15,16], as well as host\u2013parasitoid coevolution [15,16,59,60], will\ncommonly involve hosts on the same oak taxon and plant organ.\nSignificant Impacts of Gall Extended Phenotypes Support\nthe Enemy Hypothesis\nOne initially counterintuitive finding of studies comparing\nparasitoid communities associated with different host feeding\nFigure 2.

This may be because, as proposed by Stireman and\nSinger [5] for tachinid fly parasitoid communities, well-defended\nhosts suffer lower mortality from attack by generalist vertebrate\n(and possibly invertebrate) predators, and so represent enemy-free\nspace [61] for their specialist parasitoids. Whether the same\napplies to cynipid galls and their associated parasitoids or not, the\nEnemy Hypothesis predicts that the high host mortality imposed\nby parasitoids on most insect gall inducers should drive the\nevolution of gall phenotypes that reduce attack by, or exclude, at\nleast a subset of them [1,2,27,33,52,62]. Though there is evidence\nthat herbivore extended phenotypes do structure parasitoid\nassemblages across host species [18,63], no previous studies have\ndemonstrated an impact of the complex gall morphology traits\nthat predict vulnerability to attack within gall-inducer species\n[27,52,53]. This led to the hypothesis that observed phenotypic\ndiversity in some galler lineages represents the \u2018\u2018ghost of parasitism\npast\u2019\u2019 [51], whose efficacy in influencing parasitoid attack has been\nnullified by the evolution of effective parasitoid countermeasures.\nOur results show that in the rich, sympatric communities of\ncynipid gallwasps on oaks, the gall-associated extended phenotypes\nof gallwasp genes can structure parasitoid communities, and so\nFigure 3.

Further, they show\nthat traits expressed in two distinct stages of the gallwasp lifecycle\ncan influence community structure, because while gall morphol-\nogy is controlled by genes expressed in the gallwasp larva, oak\ntaxon, gall location, and the grouping of hosts within gall\nstructures are all determined by the oviposition behaviour of the\nadult female [23,25,41].\nAlthough we have demonstrated that gall morphology influ-\nences parasitoid community composition, none of the gall\nmorphologies we sampled were free of parasitoids, and so none\nrepresent true enemy-free space [61]. This suggests that any\nenemy-free space gained by novel gall morphologies is only\ntransient [1,2,27,35]. The ability of all but seven of the parasitoid\nspecies in this study to attack multiple gall morphologies implies\nthat parasitoids are able to circumvent some structural gall\ndefences through behavioural or phenological plasticity [35], and\nconsequently the coevolution of host morphological defences with\nparasitoid attack mechanisms is probably diffuse [15,35,60]. For a\ngallwasp, our results suggest that the best way to escape its current\nparasitoid community in a given generation is to shift to a new oak\ntaxon, or to a new location on its current oak host. Which of these\nroutes has been exploited in the evolution of gallwasp communities\nwill depend on the relative frequency of each kind of shift during\ngallwasp diversification. In contrast to other gall inducers [18], oak\ngallwasps shift between oak lineages extremely rarely [41], while\nchanges in gall location and morphology are more frequent\n[23,25,26]. However, when evolutionary shifts in gall location\noccur, they will often be a case of \u2018\u2018out of the frying pan and into\nthe fire,\u2019\u2019 because of subsequent detection and exploitation of\nnovel hosts by parasitoid species already attacking other host galls\nresident in the same spatiotemporal niche [1,2].\nWhy then are similar impacts of gall morphology not seen in the\nparasitoid communities associated with species-rich radiations of\nhosts inducing structurally complex galls on other plants (such as\nAsphondyllia gall midges on creosote bush, Larrea tridentata; [52])?\nOne possibility is that gall phenotypes in these radiations do\nrepresent the \u2018\u2018ghost of parasitism past.\u2019\u2019 An alternative is that\nrelationships between gall morphology and associated communi-\nties may only become apparent when phylogenetic patterns are\ncontrolled for. Changes in parasitoid assemblages during evolu-\ntionary diversification of a host lineage represent the sum of\nphylogenetic correlation between the assemblages attacking\nrelated hosts, and the impacts of variation in any host traits\ninfluencing parasitoid attack. If phylogenetic correlations are\nstrong (as they are in a range of host\u2013parasitoid systems [5,18,56]),\nsignificant impacts of gall morphology traits may only be revealed\nwhen host phylogeny is controlled for, as we have done here.\nThough patterns of evolution have been examined in Asphondyllia\ngall traits [64], to our knowledge phylogenetically controlled\nanalyses of associated parasitoid assemblages have yet to be made.\nIn addition to their parasitoid natural enemies, some cynipid\ngallwasps are also attacked by opportunist vertebrate natural\nenemies, including insectivorous birds [43]. Studies on other gall-\ninducer systems [34] have shown that birds can impose directional\nselection on gall traits, and although available evidence shows that\nparasitoids inflict the vast majority of natural enemy-imposed\nmortality in cynipid galls [43], it is possible that the traits we\ndiscuss here could also influence bird predation in this system.\nTable 2.

Traits Structure Parasitoid Communities\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 8 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\nGall Traits Structure Communities through Their Impact\non Generalist Parasitoids\nSpecies rich communities of insect herbivores often harbour\nmultiple generalist parasitoids [15,16,44,50,65], raising the\nquestion of how host species richness is maintained in the face\nof apparent competition [9,66\u201369]. Our results show that within\neach gallwasp generation, significant impacts of host traits on\nparasitoid community structure primarily involve generalist\nparasitoids (Figure 4). This argues against the existence of clearly\ndefined tritrophic niches in gallwasp communities, in which hosts\nin specific niches are attacked by specific sets of natural enemies\n[1,2]. However, the fact that generalist parasitoids vary in the\nmortality they inflict in different spatiotemporal niches makes\nthem less generalist than their host ranges would suggest. Though\nwe have not explicitly examined it here, one possible consequence\nof this is a weakening of indirect interactions (such as apparent\ncompetition) between hosts mediated by shared enemies\n[25,65,68], with potential contributions to food web stability\n[67,69,70]. Interaction networks can also be stabilised by switching\nof parasitoids between alternative hosts [66,67]. If such host\nswitching occurs in oak gall parasitoids, our results suggest that it\nwill be primarily among hosts in the same gall generation and\nprobably on the same oak taxon.\nFurther studies across guilds of natural enemies that exploit\npotentially coevolving hosts are needed to assess the generality of\nthe patterns of community structure found here. Influential\ngeneralist natural enemies attacking spatiotemporally linked\nmetacommunities of hosts may be a feature of many natural\ncommunities, as oak gall communities show many similarities with\nthose centred on other concealed insect herbivores (such as other\ngall inducers, leaf miners, or stem borers) [15,16,22,45\u201347,65,68],\nincluding many pests and potential targets for biological control.\nOur work underlines the need to incorporate host phylogeny into\nanalyses of community structure, and doing so may help to predict\nFigure 4. Host trait-associated variation in parasitism by generalist parasitoids in communities associated with sexual and asexual\ngeneration oak gallwasp communities. The dominance plot shows, for the five most generalist parasitoid species, the proportion individuals of\na given species comprise of all emerged parasitoids ( = dominance) averaged across host gall types with specific gall locations and oak associations.\nGall locations refer to the plant organ galled (the location category \u2018\u2018wood\u2019\u2019 refers to galls integral to the main axis of shoots), while oak taxon\nassociations refer to gall induction on species in either Quercus section Cerris or section Quercus sensu stricto. The selected parasitoid taxa are A.\ngallarum (Eulophidae), C. fungosa (Pteromalidae), E. brunniventris (Eurytomidae), M. dorsalis (Torymidae), and S. biguttata (Eurytomidae). The data\nfrom different host gall types have been pooled at two biologically relevant spatial scales, namely galls on different plant organs (left) and on\ndifferent oak host taxa (right).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pbio.1000179.g004\nHost Traits Structure Parasitoid Communities\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 9 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\nboth the natural enemies awaiting invading hosts, and the\nnontarget hosts of possible biocontrol agents [65].\nMaterials and Methods\nHost Species and Their Gall Traits\nFull names of all host gallwasp species are listed in Table S1 and\ngall traits are defined in Table 1. Gall morphology traits were\nrecorded for mature galls and are listed in Table S2, and shown in\nFigure S2. Gall season refers to the date of the first recorded onset\nof development of a gall type (see Table 1). Gall persistence was\nmeasured in weeks from the onset of development until the gall\ninducer emerged, or the gall fell from the tree, or the end of\nparasitoid attack in a given year\u2014assumed here to be the end of\nOctober on the basis of parasitoid emergence dates from our\nrearings.\nHost abundance per gall was estimated using the mean number\nof parasitoids emerging from a single gall of each phenotype. Both\nsample size and the mean number of parasitoids per gall were\nln(value +1) transformed prior to analysis.\nParasitoid Community Data\nGalls were collected between 2000 and 2003 at five field sites in\nHungary (Figure S1) and reared individually in outside insectaries.\nAt each sample site, galls were collected from.100 individual trees\ncomprising all oak species present, separated by an average of 20\u2013\n50 m, over an area of approximately 0.25 km2 (500 m6500 m).\nEach site was searched systematically and thoroughly at fortnightly\nintervals between April and October, and where natural host\ndistributions allowed, each gall type was harvested as far as possible\nacross the full site area. Galls were harvested haphazardly with\nrespect to height and aspect, to a maximum of 8 m above ground\nlevel with a long handled pruner. Galls were always harvested in\ntheir first year of development, typically across a number of dates\nbut also before emergence of gall inhabitants and after adequate gall\ngrowth to allow inhabitants to develop to adulthood. The emerging\nwasps were identified to species level and all host and parasitoid\nspecies are listed in Tables S1 and S3. The target sample size per\ngall type per site was 150, based on our previous work on cynipid\ncommunities [24,28,29]. Because of unavoidable variation in what\nwas actually reared (Table S4), sample size was fitted as a covariate\nin all analyses. Pairwise similarities between parasitoid communities\nfor use in both MCA and Analyses Of SIMilarity (ANOSIM; [71])\nwere calculated as Bray-Curtis similarities in PRIMER 5 (Primer-E\nLtd) from standardised untransformed parasitoid abundances. We\ndid this for individual sites and for the pooled sites dataset (i) for\npooled gallwasp generations to allow us to test differences between\nsexual and asexual generation communities (ANOSIM), and (ii) for\nsexual and asexual generations separately to allow analyses of\npatterns within each generation (MCA). The ANOSIM analyses\nwere carried out as a one-way design using generation as\nexplanatory factor. The number of possible permutations was\ncapped at 999. To allow analysis of community composition using\nphylogenetically independent contrasts, the Bray-Curtis matrix was\ndecomposed into three mutually independent variables using MDS\n[72]. Three MDS dimensions were used for each dataset, which\nreduced STRESS [72] (a measure of goodness of fit) to below an\nacceptable threshold [72] of 0.15 in every case. Each MDS\ndimension was tested as a separate response variable. The parasitoid\ncommunity response variables and other descriptors (MDS axes,\nspecies richness, sampling effort) are listed in Table S4. The oaks\nattacked by gallwasp hosts were identified to oak section, either\nsection Cerris (Q. cerris) or section Q. sensu stricto (Q. petraea, Q.\npubescens, Q. robur). We did not attempt to separate species within the\nsection Quercus because extensive hybridisation makes definitive\nallocation of individuals to species using either morphological or\nmolecular markers impossible [73\u201378]. In this we match observed\npatterns in oak gallwasp host specificity [25,39,41] and follow\nprevious analyses of insect biodiversity on Western Palaearctic oaks\n[79,80].\nGallwasp Phylogeny\nThe gallwasp phylogeny was estimated from partial sequences\n(433 base pairs, accession numbers in Table S1) of the mitochondrial\ncytochrome b locus. Generation of the sequence data and selection\nof appropriate models of sequence evolution for this locus are\ndiscussed in detail elsewhere [39,41]. Our phylogenetic hypothesis\n(working phylogeny sensu Grafen [42]) was generated using a\nBayesian approach in MRBAYES 3.0 [81] using the general time-\nreversible (GTR) model of sequence evolution. Trees were sampled\nover 106 generations with an empirically determined burn-in period\nof 105 generations before tree sampling began. Convergence of\nparameter estimates over each run was confirmed using TRACER\n[82]. As in previous phylogenetic analyses of Western Palaearctic oak\ngallwasps [23,25,41], we used the rose gallwasp Diplolepis rosae as the\noutgroup. The topology of the phylogeny used here matches very\nclosely the results of more extensive published analyses that use a\ncombination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers [25,41].\nGenBank (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Genbank) accession num-\nbers for all sequences used in our analysis are listed in Table S1.\nAnalysis of Phylogenetically Independent Contrasts\nWe used PRA [42] for multiple regression of phylogenetically\nindependent contrasts in GLIM 4.0. This approach uses a user-\ndefined working phylogeny to structure a generalised linear\nmodelling analysis in which significance of each explanatory\nvariable was tested in turn while controlling for all others. The\napproach assumes a normal distribution during model fitting, and\nwhere necessary, variables were transformed to meet this\nassumption (see \u2018\u2018Host Species and Their Gall Traits\u2019\u2019 above).\nTo minimise the impact of phylogenetic uncertainty on the\nregression procedure [42], we took the conservative approach of\ncollapsing nodes with a posterior probability of ,70% into\npolytomies. Grafen\u2019s default \u2018\u2018figure 2 method\u2019\u2019 [42] was used to\ndetermine the initial distribution of branch lengths (node\nheight = (i 2 1)\/(n 2 1), where n=number of species and\ni=number of species below that node in the phylogeny). Minimal\nadequate models (MAM) were determined by stepwise removal of\nall nonsignificant (p.0.05) variables. Where the multilevel factors\n\u2018\u2018plant organ galled\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018gall toughness\u2019\u2019 were retained in\nmodels, the categories were split into a series of binary variables.\nThese were then tested in all possible combinations, controlling for\nother significant variables, to reveal significant categories. In\nanalyses for separate generations and sites, significance levels were\nadjusted for multiple tests using the Bonferroni correction\n(corrected threshold p=1 2 (1 2 alpha)1\/k where k is the number\nof tests and alpha is the desired threshold value of 5%). The\nnumbers of species and independent contrasts in each analysis are\ngiven in Table 4.\nMCA\nIn these analyses, host relatedness was incorporated as a\ncovariate and estimated as (1 \u2013 the GTR model proportional\nsequence divergence between host species pairs) for the cyto-\nchrome b data, calculated using PAUP* [83]. Pairwise divergences\nbetween species for this gene closely parallel those in a nuclear\ngene (long wavelength opsin; [41]), suggesting that this is an\nappropriate measure of phylogenetic relatedness. MCA was\nHost Traits Structure Parasitoid Communities\nPLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 10 August 2009 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e1000179\ncarried out with simple or partial Mantel permutation tests in\nFSTAT [84], using 2,000 permutations and following Manly [85].\nAs in the PRA, nonsignificant variables were removed from each\nfull model to leave the MAM. Analyses were carried out for pooled\nand single sites, for separate generations. Similarities in gall traits\nwere calculated using the Manhattan method for continuous\nvariables and the Jaccard index for binary variables [86].\nAnalyses of Parasitoid Dominance\nWe used a SIMPER analysis in PRIMER5 to reveal which\nspecies of parasitoid accounted for the majority of pairwise Bray-\nCurtis similarity in associated parasitoid communities of host gall\ntypes. Most of the variation could be attributed to five species: A.\ngallarum (Eulophidae), Cecidostiba fungosa (Pteromalidae), Eurytoma\nbrunniventris (Eurytomidae), M. dorsalis (Torymidae), and S. biguttata\n(Eurytomidae). All five species are extreme generalists and were\nrecorded from more than 20 host gall types in this study (Table\nS3). To visualise variation in the impact of these species across\ngalls with different traits, we (i) calculated the dominance of each\nspecies in each host gall type as the proportion of individuals of\nthat species of the total of emerging parasitoids, and then (ii)\naveraged the dominance values for each parasitoid species across\nhost gall types sharing each selected trait of interest.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Field sampling sites.
