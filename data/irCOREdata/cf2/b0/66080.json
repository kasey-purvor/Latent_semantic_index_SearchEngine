The electric dipole moments of\nultracold polar molecules could also be used as qubits in\nquantum computation [9].\nOne very promising route for the production of cold\ndipolar molecules is molecular beam deceleration [10].\nMeijer and co-workers have developed a decelerator\nbased on the molecular Stark effect and switched inho-\nmogeneous electric fields [11] and have used it to slow a\nbeam of ND3 molecules and trap them at a temperature\naround 25 mK [12]. Beam deceleration is also applicable\nto other polar molecules, such as OH [13] and H2O, but is\ntypically likely to achieve temperatures only of the order\nof 1 mK. To cool the molecules further, towards tempera-\ntures where quantum degeneracy might be achieved, an-\nother cooling technique is needed. One possible route is\nsympathetic cooling by thermal contact with a cold\natomic gas such as 87Rb [14].\nThe purpose of the present Letter is to investigate the\npotential energy surfaces for interaction of a polar mole-\ncule with an alkali atom, in order to help understand\ncollisions in molecule-alkali atom mixtures. For this\nprototype study, we choose NH (X 3\f\u0002) interacting\nwith with Rb (2S). This system is topical because Meijer\nand co-workers [15] have recently proposed a scheme for\nthe production of ultracold NH molecules in their ground\nvibronic state. In this scheme, NH molecules in their\nlong-lived a1\u000e metastable state are first slowed in a\nStark decelerator. The molecules are then excited to the\nv \u0003 0 level of the A 3\u0010 excited state, allowed to decay\nspontaneously to the v \u0003 0 level of the X 3\f\u0002 ground\nstate, and finally trapped magnetically.\nAn important and general point is that many molecule-\nalkali atom systems have deeply bound electronic states\nwith ion-pair character. Alkali-metal atoms have low\nionization energies, while molecules containing electro-\nnegative elements such as C, N, and O and the halogens\noften have a low-lying unoccupied orbital that can accept\nan extra electron relatively easily. There is thus an ion-\npair state (Rb\u0004NH\u0002 in the present case) that is asymptoti-\ncally not far above the energy of the neutrals. Because of\nthe Coulomb attraction between the ions, the potential\nsurface for the ion-pair state cuts down fast in energy\nwith decreasing separation, and around the equilibrium\ngeometry is often the lowest electronic state. As we see\nbelow, this is the case for RbNH.\nThe X 3\f\u0002 ground state of NH has two electrons with\nparallel spins in \u0006 antibonding orbitals. At collinear\ngeometries (with C1v point group symmetry), there are\ntwo electronic states of RbNH, 4\f\u0002 and 2\f\u0002, which\ncorrelate with the NH\u0006X 3\f\u0002\u0007 \u0004 Rb\u00062S\u0007 dissociation\nlimit. At nonlinear geometries (with Cs symmetry), these\ntwo states become 4A00 and 2A00. These states are princi-\npally bound by dispersion forces. However, as mentioned\nabove, there is also an ion-pair threshold Rb\u0004\u00061S\u0007 \u0004\nNH\u0002\u00062\u0010\u0007 less than 4 eV above the neutral threshold.\nThe resulting 2\u0010 ion-pair state of RbNH is subject to\nthe Renner-Teller effect and splits at nonlinear geometries\ninto two states with the electron hole either in the tri-\natomic plane (2A0) or perpendicular to it (2A00). There are\nthus two 2A00 states, one of ion-pair character and one\ndispersion-bound, which form a conical intersection at\nlinear geometries, where one has 2\u0010 and the other 2\f\u0002\nsymmetry. [This is a conical intersection on the two-\ndimensional surface obtained when the NH bond length\nrNH is fixed; in three dimensions, the two surfaces inter-\nsect on a seam at linear geometries.]\nThe influence of ion-pair states on collisions of alkali-\nmetal atoms and similar species has been called the\n\u2018\u2018harpoon\u2019\u2019 mechanism [16]. If the electron transfer takes\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending23 APRIL 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 16\n163202-1 0031-9007=04=92(16)=163202(4)$22.50 \uf6d9 2004 The American Physical Society 163202-1\nplace at long range, as is often the case, large collision\ncross sections result. The range of the harpooning is\ndetermined by the position RX of the crossing point\n(conical intersection). This can be estimated from\n\u000eE0 \u0003 e\n2\n4\u0006\"0RX\n; (1)\nwhere \u000eE0 is the difference between the Rb ionization\nenergy and the NH\u0002 vertical ionization energy (NH elec-\ntron affinity). The experimental values for the Rb ioniza-\ntion potential and the NH vertical electron affinity are\n4.177 eV [17] and 0.387 eV, respectively; the latter is\nobtained from the adiabatic NH electron affinity\n(0.381 eV) [18] and a calculated value of the difference\nbetween the zero-point energies of NH and NH\u0002\n(0.006 eV) [19]. This gives an estimate of RX \b 3:79 \u0012A.\nBecause in NH\u0002\u00062\u0010\u0007 the negative charge is concentrated\non the nitrogen atom, RX represents the distance between\nN and Rb.\nThe nature of the dispersion-bound and ion-pair states\ndepends on the electron configuration of the molecular\npartner. For Rb-OH, for example, the dispersion-bound\nstates are 1\u0010 and 3\u0010 at linear geometries, splitting into\n1A0, 1A00, 3A0, and 3A00 at nonlinear geometries, while the\nion-pair state is a closed-shell singlet (1\f\u0004 or 1A0). As for\nRb-NH, therefore, there is no ion-pair state for the highest\nallowed spin multiplicity. For Rb-CH, the dispersion-\nbound states are the same, but there are many more ion-\npair states arising from a \u00062 configuration: 3\f\u0002 (3A00), 1\u000e\n(1A0 and 1A00), and 1\f\u0004 (1A0). The only dispersion-bound\nstate that does not have an ion-pair counterpart in this\ncase is the 3A0 state. In Rb-HF, the lowest ion-pair state\ndoes not come deep enough to cross below the dispersion-\nbound state, because HF is a closed-shell molecule with-\nout a low-lying unoccupied orbital.\nThe high values of the dipole polarizabilities for\nalkali-metal atoms imply large dispersion forces.\nBecause of this, the crossing point is in the classically\nallowed region of the dispersion-bound state for many\nmolecule-alkali atom systems. This is the case for RbNH.\nThe \u2018\u2018harpooning\u2019\u2019 is thus a barrierless process, and no\ntunneling is required for the charge transfer.\nTo obtain a more quantitative picture of the RbNH\nelectronic states, we have carried out ab initio calcula-\ntions at the CASSCF\/MRCI level (complete active space\nself-consistent field\/multireference configuration interac-\ntion). For N and H, we used the aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets of\nDunning [20] in uncontracted form, and for Rb we used\ntwo different approaches: (i) the quasirelativistic small-\ncore effective core potential (ECP) ECP28MWB [21]\nwith the valence basis set from Ref. [22]; the (10,3) active\nspace covers all the occupied orbitals on N and H and all\nthe large-valence and 5p orbitals on Rb, and (ii) the large-\ncore ECP ECP36SDF [23] with a new valence basis set\nand including the core polarization term [24]; this allows\na larger (13,5) active space covering Rb orbitals from 5s\nto 6p (including 4d), as well as the occupied orbitals on N\nand H. This gives better Rb excitation energies and is thus\nmore suitable for excited-state calculations. Only the\nelectrons in the 1s orbital on N were excluded from the\ncorrelation calculations. All the calculations were per-\nformed using the MOLPRO package [25].\nFigure 1 shows the lowest few curves calculated with\nthe small-core ECP for Rb-N-H angles of 180\t and 170\t\n(for fixed NH bond length). The minimum on the quartet\nsurface is at a depth of 0.078 eV at rRbN \u0003 3:26 \u0012A, while\nthat on the doublet ion-pair surface is at a depth of De \u0003\n1:372 eV at rRbN \u0003 2:53 \u0012A. At linear geometries the 2\u0010\nand 2\f\u0002 curves cross at RX \u0003 3:77 \u0012A. At nonlinear ge-\nometries the crossing is replaced by an avoided crossing.\nNote that the minimum of the 2\f\u0002 curve is at a shorter\nRb-N distance (around 3:4 \u0012A) than the crossing point, so\nthat at 170\t the 1 2A00 curve has just one minimum.\nThe collisional processes in Rb-NH mixtures will\ndepend greatly on the magnetic states that are present.

If the NH\u0006X 3\f\u0002\u0007 molecules are initially in their\nground rovibrational state (v \u0003 0; N \u0003 0; J \u0003 1;M \u0003 1)\n[15], only elastic and reorientation (spin-changing) atom-\nmolecule collisions can occur. Under these circum-\nstances, trap loss will be caused only by spin-changing\ncollisions and by three-body recombination processes.\nIf the species present are not in spin-stretched states,\ncollisions will also involve the doublet surfaces. In this\ncase, the harpoon mechanism may be important and may\nenhance the rates of reorientation collisions. In addition,\nthe transient collision complexes formed during the col-\nlision will be highly polar and may be expected to have\nenhanced interactions with other species. Three-body\ncollision rates may thus be large. Collisions with third\nbodies might also result in vibrational quenching and\nformation of bound RbNH\u00062\u0010\u0007 molecules with ionic\ncharacter, and consequently in trap loss. However, be-\ncause of the short-range nature of this type of three-\nbody recombination (which can occur only when the\ndistance between the N and Rb is smaller than RX), it\ncannot be described in terms of the fragment-fragment\nscattering lengths and a three-body parameter.\nThe existence of ion-pair states also offers the possi-\nbility of producing extremely polar molecules. The elec-\ntric dipole moment ofRbNH\u00062\u0010\u0007 varies from 8.7 to15.3 D\nbetween the potential minimum and the crossing point.\nSuch molecules would provide a valuable probe of low-\ntemperature physics of dipolar gases, because phenomena\nrelated to dipole-dipole interactions, such as linking of\npolar molecules [26], will be significantly enhanced.\nFigure 2 shows a possible photoassociation scheme in-\nvolving an excited 2\u0010 state that correlates with\nNH\u00063\f\u0002\u0007 \u0004 Rb\u00062P\u0007. The corresponding potential curve\nhas an unusual square-bottomed shape because of an\navoided crossing with the 2\u0010 ion-pair state. Because of\nthis, it has vibrational states that have good Franck-\nCondon overlap with both low-energy continuum states\non the lowest 2\f\u0002 state and low-lying vibrational states of\nthe 2\u0010 ion-pair state. There are several vibrational levels\nof the excited 2\u0010 state that are good candidates for this\nscheme; the v0 \u0003 18 state shown in Fig. 2 has a vibra-\ntional overlap of 0.17 to the v00 \u0003 0 ion-pair ground state.\nThe electronic transition moment is also favorable, at\naround 0.1 D near the potential minimum. It thus seems\nentirely feasible to produce Rb\u0004NH\u0002 by a pump-dump\nscheme or even by excitation followed by spontaneous\nemission. The wavelengths required for the pump and\ndump lasers (ca. 800 and 420 nm, respectively) are in\neasily accessible spectral regions.\nIn conclusion, ion-pair states are likely to have impor-\ntant consequences for the physics of sympathetic cool-\ning of molecules. They provide additional mechanisms\nfor inelastic collisions and three-body recombination\nbut also offer the possibility of creating extremely di-\npolar molecules. A detailed theoretical investigation of\nRb-molecule collisions will require full calculations on\nthe interacting surfaces and either an explicitly nonadia-\nbatic treatment of the collision dynamics or unraveling of\nthe surfaces to produce a diabatic representation. We are\ncurrently working on this, but it is outside the scope of the\npresent paper.\nWe thank G. Meijer for drawing our attention to this\ntopic.

The Rb core elec-\ntric dipole polarizability 8:67a30 and the cutoff parameter\n0:2413a0 were used in the core polarization potential.\n[25] MOLPRO is a package of ab initio programs written by\nH.-J.
