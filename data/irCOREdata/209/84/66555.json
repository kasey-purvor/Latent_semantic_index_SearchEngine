It argues that suggestions that we have moved away from \nterritorial understandings of politics fail to conceptually elaborate the notion of \nterritory itself. Drawing parallels between mathematics and politics in the \nseventeenth century, the paper claims that the notion of territory is \ndependent on a particular way of grasping space as calculable. This way of \nunderstanding space makes bounded territories possible, but also underlies \nnew global configurations. In other words globalisation is a reconfiguration of \nexisting understandings rather than the radical break some suggest. The \narticle concludes by making some comments on this reconfiguration, and \nsuggesting that further historical and conceptual work on territory is \nnecessary before it can be thought to be superseded. \n \nKey Words \n \nTerritory \u2013 Globalisation \u2013 Geometry \u2013 Descartes \u2013 Leibniz \u2013 Westphalia \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nI am grateful to Jan Aart Scholte, two additional referees, Adam Tickell, Ash \nAmin, Harriet Bulkeley, Gordon MacLeod, Joe Painter, Luiza Bialasiewicz, Neil \nBrenner and Juliet Fall for their valuable comments. Earlier versions were \ngiven as papers in Charlottesville VA, New York, Aberystwyth, and London, \nand I appreciate the useful responses there. \n 1 \nMissing the Point: Globalisation, Deterritorialisation \nand the Space of the World \n \n \nThe title sounds provocative, I know. But the reason for it is precisely its \nexcuse. The contention here is that many studies of globalisation literally, and \nconsequentially figuratively, miss the point. My concern is not with those \nstudies that look at globalisation in terms of the internationalisation of trade, \nthe homogenisation of culture or the evaporation of the power of the nation-\nstate. Instead, it is with how the concept of globalisation has been thought \ngeographically, that is spatially, both within and without the discipline of \ngeography itself. At times this has even led to the suggestion that geography \nis less significant, or even that spatial considerations are not important at all. \nThe French theorist Paul Virilio has gone so far as to argue that the \nacceleration of communication has led to a replacing of geographical space \nwith time (1986; 1999), and has suggested that \u201cdeterritorialization is the \nquestion for the end of this century\u201d (Virilio and Lotringer, 1983, p. 142). The \nparticular targets therefore are those studies which claim that globalisation is \na form of deterritorialisation, or that concomitantly claim that we have moved \nbeyond the Westphalian model of state politics.  \n \nThis essay therefore investigates the interrelation of the four terms space, \nplace, territory and deterritorialisation. The key argument is that space and \nplace should not be distinguished on the basis of scale, but that space \nemerges in Western thought through a particular way of grasping place. This \nway of grasping is as something extensible and calculable, extended in three \ndimensions and grounded on the geometric point. The claim made here is \nthat territory is not merely a political way of conceiving land, but the political \ncorollary of this emergent concept of space. Although it is integrally related to \nthe state, in that both the modern state and the modern concept of territory \nemerge at the same historical juncture, this is not to say that territory is \ninherently tied to the state. The historical moment we call globalisation \n 2 \ndemonstrates that the calculable understanding of space has been extended \nto the globe, which means that even as the state becomes less the focus of \nattention territory remains of paramount importance. The essay therefore \ntakes issue with understandings of globalisation as deterritorialisation, which \nclaim that territory no longer occupies the foundational geographical place, \nclaiming that they misconceive the very basis of this crucial term. \n \nAlthough this essay does not intend to trace the historical origins of the term \n\u201eglobalisation\u201f, there is one issue worth noting. Globalisation derives from the \nworld \u201eglobal\u201f, of much older provenance, which is concerned with the \u201ewhole \nworld\u201f, something related to, covering or influencing the world taken as a \nwhole. There is a double process going on here: first, the seizing or \ncomprehending of the world as a whole; and second the way in which \npolitical, economic or cultural acts apply to that. In other words, globalisation \nis in some sense dependent on what Lefebvre calls mondialisation, becoming \nworldly. Lefebvre suggests we must look for the conditions of possibility of \nthis mondialisation, but this cannot be reduced to linear causality or \nmechanistic determinism (1978, p. 23; see Elden, 2004a, pp. 231-5). As he \ncautions, \u201ceach mode of production has its space; but the characteristics of \nspace cannot be reduced to the general characteristics of the mode of \nproduction\u201d (1978, p. 291). It is this question of condition of possibility that is \nat stake here. The argument is that beyond the straightforward we get to the \npoint. \n \nDeterritorialisation, Territory and the Absence of Theory \n \nAs Papastergiadis shows (2000, pp. 116-7), the notion of deterritorialisation \nhas a complicated intellectual heritage, something which is not always \nappreciated. As he notes, \u201cthe cultural dynamic of deterritorialization has \ndecoupled previous links between space, stability and reproduction; it has \nsituated the notion of community in multiple locations; it has split loyalties \nand fractured the practices that secure understanding and knowledge within \nthe family and social unit\u201d (2000, p. 117). Drawing upon Deleuze and \n 3 \nGuattari\u201fs use of the term in their assessment of Kafka (1986) he notes how \nthere it was used to show how Kafka\u201fs writings in German were disruptive \nbecause of his position outside of Germany itself. This use of \ndeterritorialisation is rather different from its deployment in much of the \nliterature. For Deleuze and Guattari (see also 1988, 1994), the term is one of \nthe relation between thought and territorial placing, between internal and \nexternal exile, and bears relation to notions of nomad thought, hybridity and \ndiaspora. It has important resonances to territory taken more generally, but \neven in the more sophisticated readings of this problematic following them \n(for example, Albert, 1999) it is difficult to see quite how. The exception is \nHardt and Negri\u201fs Empire (2000), which I have discussed, along with this \nintellectual heritage, in detail elsewhere (2004b). For Papastergiadis \u201cthe \nconcept of deterritorialization has been a useful mode of understanding the \nfissures within language and cultural identity\u201d (2000, p. 118). A similar use of \nDeleuze and Guattari is made by Appadurai (1996). Extreme caution should \nbe shown in appropriating this as a model for globalisation taken as whole. \nAnd yet this caution is signally lacking.  \n \nWe therefore find deterritorialisation utilised to describe a cultural process, \nwhere the break between the social and the geographical heralds a new age \nof unplaced human interaction (Lull, 1995; Appadurai, 1996; Papastergiadis, \n2000); as related to regional and nationalist identities (Williams, 2003); and \nenvironmental issues (Castree, 2003; Kuehls, 1996). Castree here importantly \ncautions against seeing this solely as deterritorialisation, and discusses the \n\u201cdialectic of territorialization\/deterritorialization, a mixture of spatial fixity and \nunfixity\u201d (2003, p. 427). Following a similar logic, people like Anderson have \ntalked of a \u201cnew medievalism\u201d, where boundaries are overrun and sovereignty \nplural and overlapping (1996). We should be grateful the hyperbolic claims \nthat we have entered a borderless world, with the end of the nation-state and \nof geography (Ohmae, 1990, 1995; O\u201fBrien, 1992) have been widely critiqued \n(see Amin and Thrift, 1997; Yeung, 1998; Kelly, 1999; \u00d2 Tuathail, 2000; \nMacLeod, 2001). We should be similarly grateful that for many this notion of \ndeterritorialisation requires us to recognise that geography remains of \n 4 \nparamount importance, even if it needs to be understood in new, and more \ncomplicated ways. As Amin puts it  \n \nThus I have distanced myself from the territorial idea of \nsequestered spatial logics \u2013 local, national, continental and \nglobal \u2013 pitted against each other. Instead, I have chosen to \ninterpret globalisation in relational terms as the interdependence \nand intermingling of global, distant and local layers, resulting in \nthe greater hybridisation and perforation of social, economic and \npolitical life (1997, p. 133). \n \nDeterritorialisation in its most useful sense therefore forces us to think anew \non the notion of territory, and to recognise how its logic is both played out \nand challenged in a period of globalisation (see \u00d3 Tuathail, 1998, p. 82; Cox \n(ed.), 1997; Brenner, 1999a, 1999b). This goes beyond merely assuming \nterritory as a given and examining to what extent things remain in place. \nRather its position and status is itself in question (\u00d3 Tuathail, 2000, pp. 139-\n40).  \n \nGlobalisation has been explicitly seen as deterritorialisation by Scholte (2000, \np. 46), but despite the importance of this definition the term plays a relatively \nminor role in the book as a whole, and disappears from the forthcoming \nsecond edition entirely. Rather Scholte proposes a view of \nsupraterritorialization, which \u201centails a reconfiguration of geography, so that \nsocial space is no longer wholly mapped in terms of territorial places, \nterritorial distances and territorial borders\u201d (2000a, p. 96; see 2000b, p. 179). \nImportant though this reconfiguration of geography undoubtedly is, I am \nreluctant to accept his straight-forward understanding of territory, and would \npush the point further: work proposing an idea of deterritorialisation requires \nan explicit theorisation of what territory is, in order that we are not blinded to \nthe parallels between then and now in the changing nature of spatial \nrelations. In other words, what is it we have supposedly gone beyond or seen \n 5 \nrevised in significant ways? For such a crucial issue, territory is \nundertheorised to a remarkable degree.  \n \nThe standard approach, in political science as much as geography and \ninternational relations, is to take it for an unproblematic given, which is then \nfought over, redistributed and redrawn, without any conceptual \nproblematisation. In other words, there are disputes over territory, but none \nover \u201eterritory\u201f. This is despite the stress on its importance in Max Weber\u201fs \nfamous definition of the state:  \n \nThe state is that human community, which within a certain area \nor territory [Gebietes] \u2013 this \u201earea\u201f belongs to the feature \u2013 has \na (successful) monopoly of legitimate physical violence (1971, \npp. 510-11; 1994, p. 311, translation modified). \n \nAs is beginning to be realised (Brenner et. al., 2002, p. 2), the territorial part \nof this \u2013 in distinction to community, legitimacy and violence \u2013 has been \nlargely neglected, both by Weber himself and social science in general. But as \nMichael Mann recognises, the territorial aspect is not minor, but crucial: \u201cthe \nstate is, indeed a place \u2013 both a central place and a unified territorial reach\u201d. \nFor Mann this puts it in distinction to churches and companies (1985, p. 198). \nJean Gottman, who has written some of the most productive works on this \nsubject, proclaims that \u201camazingly little has been published about the concept \nof territory, although much speech, ink, and blood have been spilled over \nterritorial disputes\u201d (1973, p. ix). How much has this changed in the last thirty \nyears? For Gottman, it is all too easy to assume the modern, or legal sense of \nterritory as a \u201cportion of geographical space under the jurisdiction of certain \npeople\u201d (1973, p. 5). Similarly Friedrich Kratochwil suggests that \u201cterritoriality, \nlike property, is not a simple concept, but comprises a variety of social \narrangements that have to be examined in greater detail\u201d (1986, pp. 27-8).  \n \nHowever central the notion of territory is to definitions of the state, it \ngenerally tends to be assumed as unproblematic. Theorists have largely \n 6 \nneglected to define the term, taking it as obvious and not worthy of further \ninvestigation. One searches political dictionaries or introductory textbooks in \nvain for a conception of this notion: rather it is unhistorically accepted, \nconceptually assumed and philosophically unexamined. Its meaning is taken \nto be obvious and self-evident and can therefore be assumed in political \nanalysis. Political science that does discuss this notion tends to concentrate on \nlegal issues of secession or border disputes, or problems of refugees, \nnationalism, and core-periphery relations rather than come to terms with the \nnotion itself (for example, Bulpitt 1983; see on this point, Badie 2000). \nInternational relations as a discipline recognises the importance of territory to \nits fundamental concerns but neglects to go beyond a general statement on \nthe term. Part of the problem behind this is that realism took the state as the \nunit of examination, but as a black box and examined its relations with other \nstates on that basis, whilst more recent and innovative approaches have \ndisputed the emphasis on the state and moved their focus elsewhere. While \nthere are exceptions (Walker 1993; Shapiro 1997, for example), Ruggie\u201fs \nlament that \u201cit is truly astonishing that the concept of territoriality has been \nso little studied by students of international politics\u201d (1993, p. 174) remains \ntrue.  \n \nWhere there is an attempt to police this particular concept, the stress is on \nthe notion of boundedness. The boundaries of territorial states are what gives \nthem their internally-turned focus, they have a strictly demarcated boundary \n\u2013 the lines drawn on maps \u2013 within which they have sovereignty \u2013 symbolised \nby the blobs of bright, contrasting colour that fill the void between these lines \n(see Akerman, 1985, p. 152). As Paasi puts it, \u201cboundaries, along with their \ncommunication, comprise the basic element in the construction of territories \nand the practice of territoriality\u201d (2003, p. 112). For J\u00f6nssen, T\u00e4gil and \nT\u00f6rnqvist \u201ca territory is defined as a cohesive section of the earth\u201fs surface \nthat is distinguished from its surroundings by a boundary\u201d (2000, p. 3). The \nboundaries are set by geographical or political circumstance, which becomes \nthe object of enquiry. As Harvey notes, \u201cmuch of the philosophy of \ngeography\u2026 stems from a \u201econtainer\u201f view of space which is particularly \n 7 \nassociated with concepts of Newton and Kant\u201d (Harvey, 1969, p. 208). This \nhas led to Giddens\u201f famous definition of the state as a bordered power \ncontainer (1985). There are a large range of studies within political geography \nthat could be said to fall into this category (see, for example, Johnston, 1982; \nPrescott, 1968; Newman and Paasi, 1998). Even Peter Taylor\u201fs important \nwork looks at the \u201cstate as container\u201d (1994) and the possibility of going \n\u201cbeyond containers\u201d (1995), essentially assuming the basis of the very issue \nin question. Agnew has discussed this in terms of the \u201eterritorial trap\u201f, based \non the threefold assumption that modern state sovereignty requires clearly \nbounded territories; the opposition between foreign and domestic affairs; and \nthat the territorial state is the geographical \u201econtainer\u201f of modern society \n(1995; 1999). Although Cox has noted that \u201cin order to talk of territory one \nmust talk of territoriality and vice versa\u201d, suggesting that \u201cterritoriality refers \nto actions designed to exercise control over some area: the territory\u201d (2002, \np. 29), little sustained enquiry has followed this line (though see Sack 1983, \n1986; Malmberg, 1980; Hall, 1969). \n \nAnd yet, what makes the demarcation of such boundaries possible? What if it \nwere that condition of possibility which is the central aspect of the modern \nnotion of territory? The argument here is that it is the understanding of \npolitical space that is fundamental, and the idea of boundaries a secondary \naspect, dependent on the first. How might that affect our understanding of \nthe period we are supposedly exiting, and the period we are moving toward? \nWhat is it that allows sovereign power to spread to and through every pore of \nthe state\u201fs being? Whilst I would not wish to claim that the state is the most \nimportant object of analysis, this does strike me as a regrettable situation. \nWell-worn phrases about the Westphalian state-system assume a \nchronological birth and suggest contemporary overcoming, without a \ntheoretical understanding of what precisely is in question (Linklater 1998; \nScholte forthcoming). Indeed, the principal dispute within a large subsection \nof the literature seems to be whether this dating is correct, or whether earlier \nevidence can be found, for example in the French invasion of Italy in 1494. \n 8 \nBut what was at stake here? Regardless of its chronological birth, its \nconceptual birth is crucially important.  \n \nWhat we have on the one hand therefore is political science or theory with \nsome kind of understanding of the state, but without a comprehension of its \nrootedness, its situation, its territory; on the other political geography which \npurports to understand space and territory, but has an undeveloped sense of \nthe explicitly political and historical aspects they might have. Both \nperspectives lack a sound knowledge of philosophical and mathematical \ndevelopments in the conception of space (the two are not mutually exclusive, \nnor are they entirely congruent). Indeed, despite the much vaunted \nquantitative \u201eturn\u201f in geography of the 1950s and 1960s, Prescott suggests \nthat most issues around boundaries, frontiers and territory are unsuitable for \na mathematical analysis (1972, p. 44). While his intention is quite clear, this \nneglects the important links between mathematics and the political in the \nconstituting of those boundaries. Conceptions of geometry and conceptions of \nterritory bear close examination and relation. What then do these geographies \nof globalisation \u2013 and more broadly understandings of territory \u2013 have in \ncommon? They neglect the importance of calculation, they miss the point. \n \nThe Geometric Point \n \nThe point is crucial to understanding the way in which we conceive of space. \nTo explain this in the detail it deserves is beyond the scope of this piece, but \nlet me outline some of the major developments. In Aristotle there is a very \nclear distinction between the unit, monas, and the point, stigme. This comes \nin the context of his discussion in the Physics, Books V-VI, about the mode of \nconnection of being, and he makes a number of points that are useful to \nthinking about place in his thought (1936, 226b18-231b17). For Aristotle, the \ndistinction between the connectivity of units is that they are discrete, separate \nfrom each other. A sequence of numbers, for example, has a distance \nbetween each of them, we count one after the other, steps along the way. A \nline, in distinction, while it has points within it, cannot simply be reduced to a \n 9 \nstring of points. There is more to the line, because the connection of points is \ndifferent from the sequence of numbers. Points, when they are connected, \nliterally have the end of one as the beginning of the next, there is nothing \nbetween them \u2013 neither another point nor something else. In Aristotle\u201fs \nlanguage this is a synekhes, a continuum. It is an ephekses, a succession, \njust as the series of numbers is, but one where instead of their being the \npotential for something to be between, it is characterised by haptesthai, \ntouching. As Aristotle shows, monas and stigme cannot be the same, for their \nmode of connection is different.  \n \nFrom this we get a clear difference between arithmetic and geometry \u2013 \narithmetic is concerned with the sequence of numbers, where no touching is \nnecessary; geometry is concerned with the stigme, whose connection is \ncharacterised by the synekhes, the continuum. Arithmetic is concerned with \nsuccession where between the units, each monas, there is nothing of the \nsame lineage of being; geometry is the continuum where the ends of one \npoint, stigme, are the ends of the next. Therefore, and this is crucial, \nalthough points can be taken from a line, they do not constitute the line. \nThere is more to a line than a multiplicity of points, and by extension, more to \na surface than lines; to a volume than surfaces. Equally it is worth stressing \nthat the Greeks had no word that equates to our modern notion of \u201espace\u201f. \nDespite the regular use of the notion of \u201eEuclidean space\u201f this is a term that \nfinds no parallel in his writings (1956), and is rather a modern invention. This \ndistinction between arithmetic and geometry forms the foundation for much \nof the Middle Ages, though some of the work of late scholasticism renders it \nmuch more complicated (see Lang, 1992). This is an important part of the \nstory, but one for which there is no time here. Although I admit to a certain \ncaution in privileging his place in Western Philosophy, it is to Descartes that I \nnow turn. \n \nDescartes is important for a range of reasons, one of the most obvious being \nhis strict distinction between thought and the material world, between res \ncogitans and res extensa. For Descartes the important issue is that res \n 10 \ncogitans is indivisible whereas res extensa is divisible (1964ff, Vol VII, pp. 85-\n6). Indeed, the principal ontological determination of the world for Descartes \nis that it is extensible in three dimensions, dimensions which can be \ncalculated mathematically, through geometry. Descartes sees geometry as \nequivalent to algebra; it is the symbolic version of the world. Extension, for \nDescartes, is both a physical property and a geometrical property. What this \nmeans is not only does geometry become a way of understanding and \ncalculating the material world, but it also, because of the emphasis on \nextension and dimension, becomes a form of applied arithmetic. Whereas for \nAristotle there was a strict distinction between the two, Descartes sees \ngeometrical figures and, by extension, the world of which they are symbols, \nas numerically calculated. We find this explicitly in passages from his book \nGeometry, for example the opening line suggests that \u201call problems in \ngeometry can be simply reduced to such terms that a knowledge of the \nlengths of certain straight lines is sufficient for their construction\u201d (1954, pp. \n2\/3, translation modified). Later in the same work he suggests that \u201cin the \nmethod I use all problems which present themselves to geometers reduce to \na single type, namely, to the question of finding the values of the roots of an \nequation\u201d (1954, pp. 216\/217). In other words, geometrical problems can be \nreduced to problems of number, roots of equations or lengths of line. The \ncontinuum of geometry is therefore transformed into a sequence of numbers, \na form of arithmetic, which infinitesimal calculus would take to its ultimate \nconclusion. Descartes\u201f geometry, in distinction to Aristotle\u201fs geometry, is a \nephekses rather than a synekhes. The notion of Cartesian coordinates is the \nmost explicit recognition of this fact, but these are coordinates of a space, \nspatium, which emerges in its modern sense at this time (on this in more \ndetail see Elden, 2001; Lachterman, 1989; Klein 1992). \n \nThe Political Point \n \nIt is no surprise that Descartes\u201f philosophical-mathematical justification for \ncomprehending the world in terms of number, with the centrality of the point, \nultimately each the same as any other, comes in the midst of the seventeenth \n 11 \ncentury\u201fs scientific revolution, with key figures like Galileo preceding him, and \nothers like Newton and Leibniz following in his wake (for a geographical \nperspective on this, see Livingstone, 1990). However, this development is not \nconfined to scientific, philosophic and mathematical advances, but is \npartnered by shifts in political theory and practice. The two central political \ndevelopments were the discovery and subsequent colonisation of the new \nworld and the redrawing of the map of political power in Europe, particularly \nthrough the slow death of the Holy Roman Empire. \n \nIn terms of the new world we can see this in practice in a range of places, \nfrom the gridlines of latitude and longitude used by Thomas Jefferson and \nothers to divide the individual states of the United States (Pattison, 1970; \nSack, 1986, pp. 127-68; Cohen 1999; Linklater 2003) to the European powers \ndivision of the continent of Africa (see Pakenham, 1991; for some caution, \nsee Stone, 1988; more generally Badie, 2000). So-called \u201enatural\u201f boundaries \nare avoided for the conceptual elegance of the straight line or arc. Many \nstriking instances can be found, perhaps none more so than the town Four \nCorners, the only place in the USA where four states (Utah, Colorado, New \nMexico and Arizona) meet at a single point. More politically important, and the \nprecedent for many of the later examples, is the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 \nwhich divided Spanish and Portuguese claims to the world.  \n \nA boundary or straight line be determined and drawn north and \nsouth, from pole to pole, on the said ocean sea [the Atlantic], \nfrom the Arctic to the Antarctic pole. This boundary or line shall \nbe drawn straight, as aforesaid, at a distance of three hundred \nand seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, being \ncalculated by degrees, or by any other manner as may be \nconsidered the best and readiest, provided the distance shall be \nno greater than above said (Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494, Clause \n1). \n \n 12 \nThe dividing line allowed the King of Portugal lands to the east, the King and \nQueen of Castile those to the west. As Storey explains, broadly the aim was \nto allow Portugal Africa and Spain the Americas, but it was later discovered \npart of South America was actually to the east, hence the creation of \nPortuguese colonies there, known as Brazil (2001, pp. 16-7; see Sack, 1986, \npp. 131-2). This demonstrates that latitude was a much more successful \nmarker, until more reliable clocks allowed exact measurement of longitude. \nWhat is important about Tordesillas it that it suggests a model which the \nactual techniques only later caught up with. As Brotton (1997) shows, many \nof the maps of the world in the early period were concerned with precisely \nthis demarcation. \n \nThe Holy Roman Empire was conceived as Christendom, the secular version \nof the kingdom of God. The Emperor, crowned by the Pope in the first \ninstance, was intended to have power over the principalities, kingdoms and \ncities within a large swathe of central Europe. Two important diplomatic \nevents challenged the supremacy of the Emperor. First, the final compact of \nthe Diet of Augsburg in 1555, which had proclaimed cuius regio eius religio, to \nwhom the region the religion. What this meant was that the individual rulers, \nrather than the Emperor, were allowed to set the religion of their land. For an \nEmpire supposedly taking its lead from Rome and the Catholic Church this \ndealt a serious blow to orthodoxy. The secular equivalent of this was the \nprinciple of Rex in regno suo est Imperator regni sui \u2013 the territorial ruler\u201fs \nstanding in their areas was the same as the Emperor in his (Ruggie, 1993, p. \n157).  \n \nHowever as Osiander (2001, pp. 270-2; see 1994, pp. 12, 40) notes, the \nAugsburg principle was hard to uphold in practice and was essentially \nabandoned at the second key diplomatic event, the Treaty of Westphalia. \nInstead here, the religion of each part of the empire was frozen according to \nits situation in 1624. What the Treaty of Westphalia (or rather the treaties \u2013 \nthe one at M\u00fcnster and the one at Osnabr\u00fcck) did do was to give the estates \nof the empire the \u201cfree exercise of territorial right\u201d (Treaty of Westphalia, \n 13 \n1648, Osnabr\u00fcck, Article VIII, Clause 1; M\u00fcnster, Clause 64, see 67). In a \nvaluable attempt to subvert IR orthodoxies about the birth of sovereignty and \nthe European state-system in 1648 (such as Gross, 1948), Osiander has \ncautioned against translating this as \u201cterritorial sovereignty\u201d, suggesting that \nthe German term Landeshoheit is actually \u201cterritorial jurisdiction\u201d, and that \nwhat makes it interesting \u201cis precisely that which makes it different from \nsovereignty\u201d (2001, p. 272) \n \nThe treaty was not originally written in German, but Latin, in which the term \nwas \u201ciuris territorialis\u201d (\u201cterritorial right\u201d), or \u201ciure territorii et superioritatis\u201d \n(Treaty of Westphalia, Osnabr\u00fcck, Article V, Clause 30), \u201cterritorial right and \nsuperiority\u201d. The French equivalent was sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 territoriale (Pag\u00e8s, 1939, \np. 244; see Dickmann, 1972, pp. 129, 133). It is important to note that \nwhether this is right, jurisdiction or indeed sovereignty, it is held over \nterritory. This is central to understanding the importance of Westphalia (see \nMirabelli, 1929; Braubach, 1948; Kremer, 1989; Wyduckal, 1998). Quoting an \neighteenth century German jurist, Osiander notes that the autonomy of the \nestates \u2013 free cities and principalities \u2013 was limited through the laws of the \nempire and the constitutional arrangements. What he underplays is that \ninternally, that is \u201cin their lands and territories\u201d (Moser, 1745, p. 492, cited in \nOsiander, 2001, p. 272), they were empowered politically. In his conclusion \nhe attempts to suggest that today \u201cthere is a clear de facto trend in \ninternational politics away from classical sovereignty and toward something \ncloser to landeshoheit, territorial jurisdiction under an external legal regime \nshared by the actors\u201d (2001, p. 283). This is both important \u2013 because it \nshows us that the emergence of territory at Westphalia was not tied to some \nabsolute notion of sovereignty, as is often supposed \u2013 and potentially \nmisleading \u2013 as it underplays the importance of territory as a concept in itself, \ndistinct from sovereignty. \n \nAlthough this was the period of Hobbes, Spinoza, and Locke, it is in the \npolitical writings of Leibniz that this notion is most fully explored. Leibniz had \nbeen asked by the Duke of Hanover to clarify the position of the rulers within \n 14 \nthe Empire. Leibniz does this by distinguishing between majesty, as the power \nto demand obedience and loyalty, without being commanded themselves, and \nsovereignty, which he sees as being stressed in the treaties of Westphalia, as \nconcerned with territory. By defining sovereign as \u201che who is master of a \nterritory\u201d, Leibniz is removing the notion of absolutism and suggesting that \nwhatever the position of deference abroad, internally they are \u201cmaster at \nhome and cannot be disturbed except by arms\u201d (1969, Vol VI, p. 347). There \nare, Leibniz suggestions, \u201cdegrees of seigneurie, lordship\u201d (1969, Vol VI, p. \n368). This helpfully outlines the post-Westphalia position of the Empire \u2013 \nexternal authority but internal non-interference in the estates (see Riley, \n1988, pp. 26-8; Herz, 1957; Riley, 1996). Indeed, although the above quotes \nare from a later French dialogue entitled Entr\u00e9tiens de Philarete et d\u201fEug\u00e8ne, \nthe original Latin place where Leibniz discusses this should make us cautious \nabout accepting Osiander\u201fs claims straightforwardly. The piece is entitled \u201cDe \nJure Suprematus ac Legationis Principum Germaniae\u201d, published under the \npseudonym of \u201eCaesarinus F\u00fcrstenerius\u201f \u2013 a joke name which stresses the \nequivalence of the Emperor and the Prince, or \u201ePrince as Emperor\u201f. Here \nLeibniz makes some crucial points that are worth quoting at some length. \n \nHence there arises what the German jurists call territorial \nsuperiority [superioritatem terriorialem \u2013 i.e. Landeshoheit], or \nthe right of territory [territorii jus]. But\u2026 the lord of the \njurisdiction and the lord of the territory are two different \nthings\u2026 He who considers these things with care will see that \nterritorial superiority consists in the highest right of forcing or \ncoercing\u2026 this right, in turn, belongs not only to the princes of \nthe Empire, but also to the counts. For a long time there was \ndoubt concerning the free cities, but recently, especially by the \npeace of M\u00fcnster [Pace imprimis Monasteriensi], the question \nseems to have been settled. And what we call territorial \nsuperiority seems to be identical to what the French call la \nsouverain\u00e9t\u00e9, in a slightly looser sense (1983-4, Vol II, pp. 54-5; \n 15 \n1988, pp. 115-6, translation modified; see 1983-4, Vol II, pp. \n394-401; 1969, pp. 368-9). \n \nLeibniz goes on to stress that this does not mean that their power is absolute, \nbut that there can be a higher authority to appeal to. Equally, as the \nexamples of Switzerland and the United Provinces show, \u201cseveral territories, \nmoreover, can unite in one body, retaining their singular territorial \nsuperiority\u201d (1983-4, Vol II, p. 57; 1988, p. 117, translation modified). \nAccording to Herz, Leibniz therefore saw himself as \u201cthe first to have found \nthe valid definition of sovereignty\u201d (1957, p. 478), but this is a notion \nexplicitly tied to territory. \n \nIn the Europe of this time we can see a range of techniques for mapping and \ncharting start to emerge. Escolar suggests that the techniques of a \nrejuvenated cartography were used for \u201cbureaucratic and administrative \nmanagement and territorial control of state power in the states of Western \nEurope\u201d in the sixteenth century (2002, p. 33). This is unsurprising, given the \nimportance of territory to rulers. As Harley notes, \u201cthe state became \u2013 and \nhas remained \u2013 a principal patron of cartographic activity in many countries\u201d \n(2001, p. 59). Virilio puts it even more strongly: \u201cGeometry is the necessary \nfoundation for a calculated expansion of state power in space and time\u201d \n(1975, p. 120). The use of satellite eclipses for demarcating boundaries, \nparticularly in France with the work of the Cassini family, Vauban\u201fs work on \nmathematics and war, and the establishment of the first modern boundary in \nEurope through the Pyrenees in 1659 are all examples here (see Sahlins, \n1989; Virilio, 1977, p. 17). Escolar summarises this usefully: \n \nThe surveying and instrumental representation of the territory of \nthe state associated with administrative and scientific \ncartography in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were \nmade possible by the development of cartographic techniques \nduring the Renaissance\u2026 on the one hand, and, on the other, \n 16 \nthe transformation of conspicuous state power into geographical \njurisdiction (2002, pp. 35-6). \n \nIn an illuminating study of the relation between Cartesian thought and new \nmodels of urban planning, Akkerman notes that \u201cwith the renunciation of the \nold urban and architectural styles, medieval mental structures came tumbling \ndown as well\u201d (2001, p. 157). We can, I think, see something very similar in \nthe new political models of space at the level of the kingdom or the continent. \nHowever Akkerman tends to see this development as rather one sided, a \ncrude materialism where \u201claying the foundation of modern science, the \nparadigm of the geometrically perfect world had emerged from a \ngeometrically perfect town: it is in this image that Descartes, as well as his \ncontemporaries, were led to perceive the universe and everything in it\u201d (2001, \np. 161). Rather, as some of his later comments suggest (2001, p. 162), the \nrelation between the ideas and the practice is constantly shifting, with \ndevelopments in Scholasticism affecting urban and political practices, which in \nturn impact on philosophies of the time. \n \nWhat this means is that the notion of territory is both a historical \ndevelopment and has a particular conceptual basis. Territory in the modern \nsense requires a level of cartographic ability that was simply lacking in earlier \nperiods, an ability that is closely related to advances in geometry. Despite \nsome similarities, it does not make sense to think about the Greek polis and \nits land in terms of the modern notions of state and territory (for a discussion \nand references, see Elden, 2003). Rome, with the transition from monarchy to \nrepublic to empire provides a number of pointers along the way, but again \nstraight-forward equation with the modern concepts is misleading. As is \ngenerally recognised, the Middle Ages, despite the importance of property in \nland, did not have a developed sense of territory. As Camille notes, \u201cthere \nwas no such thing as \u201espace\u201f for medieval people\u2026 our modern abstract \nnotion of space\u2026 is a postmedieval category\u201d (2000, p. 9; see Zumthor, \n1993). It is only really in the Renaissance, with the birth of the Italian city-\nstates of the late 15th century, that clear indications of the direction to be \n 17 \ntaken start to emerge. To trace this in detail would require examination both \nof political and diplomatic developments, and of the work of theorists such as \nMachiavelli, Jean Bodin and Hobbes, as well as the less obvious figures of \nLeibniz, Spinoza and Grotius, but also the conceptual and mathematical \ndevelopments in the work of Galileo, Descartes and Newton. And, as Sack and \nPaasi have noted, abstract, metrical space was mirrored by capitalism\u201fs \nincreased production and consumption (Sack, 1986, pp. 84-5, 218; Paasi, \n2003, p. 114). This point is both crucial and in danger of being missed. \n \nEssentially the argument here is that the emergence of a notion of space \nrests upon a shift in mathematical and philosophical understanding, related \nparticularly to geometry. This development is partnered by a change in \nconceptions of the state and its territory. The modern notion of measure, \nwhich finds its most explicit exponent in Descartes, sees beings as calculable, \nas quantitatively measurable, as extended; for Descartes calculation is the \nfundamental determination of the world. Put crudely, to be is to be calculable. \nAs Sack notes, \u201cto think of territory as emptiable and fillable is easier when a \nsociety possesses writing and especially a metrical geometry to represent \nspace independently of events\u2026 the coordinate system of the modern map is \nideally suited\u201d (1986, p. 63). This calculative mode of thinking is related to \nthe measuring and ordering of land, but also to \u201cthe development of political \narithmetic in seventeenth century Europe, which entailed the cataloguing of \nthe physical and human resources of the state\u201d (Pacione, 1985, p. 1). Indeed, \nthe rise of statistics \u2013 the description of states \u2013 dates from this time. \nCalculation is therefore key to the constitution of the modern state.  \n \nTerritory, Abstract Space and Globalisation \n \nTerritory then is partly about boundaries and the impermeability of these \nboundaries, but also about a political usage of the emergent concept of \nspace, particularly as it emerges in the late middle ages, the Renaissance and \nthe early modern period. Space, as it comes to be known, is bounded and \nexclusive, where something can share the same place but not the same \n 18 \nspace, but more crucially is something calculated, extended in three \ndimensions. It is because mapping then becomes that much more exact that \ndemarcation, exclusion and control become possible. Space and place, in this \nunderstanding, are not distinguished on the basis of scale (space is out there, \nplace is in here), but on the basis of calculation. An attempt to think space \nand place in non-scalar terms has been attempted by Taylor (1999; see Amin, \n2002, pp. 388-9), where he sees space as the abstract, and place as the \nsubstantive, but this too neglects, or perhaps underplays, the importance of \nthe mathematical. The concept of space \u2013 abstract and mathematical \u2013 is \nsuperimposed over already existing places, be they land, home or country. \nThe abstract space of maps and mathematics is a grid imposed over the top, \nthe territory of modern states becomes possible. \n \nIf there is a shift today beyond this, it is that the space is no longer that of a \nsingle country (or later, nation), but that of the world as a whole. The \nabstract space is extended to the globe, which is understood as a geometrical \nobject. Conceived in this way it can be divided, or ordered as a whole. Ideas \nof transworld simultaneity or instantaneity \u2013 that things \u201cextend anywhere \nacross the planet at the same time\u201d, or \u201cin no time\u201d respectively \u2013 add, \nScholte argues, another dimension to territorial geography, hence the idea of \nsupraterritoriality (forthcoming). But this does not escape the \u201elogic\u201f of \nterritory, rather it demonstrates the importance of the temporal to \nunderstandings of spatiality, a parameter of t added to those of x, y and z. \nEach of these four dimensions is rendered calculable. Time is \u201cnothing but \nrapidity, instantaneity and simultaneity [Schnelligkeit, Augenblicklichkeit und \nGleichzeitigkeit]\u201d as Heidegger recognised in 1935 lectures (1953, pp. 28-9). \nTime [Zeit] is rendered the same [Gleich], each moment a point on a time-\nseries, with these moments increasingly close together in a acceleration of \nspeeds. Even discussion of the shift from a space of places to a space of flows \n(Castells, 1989; 1996, pp. 405-59) requires some form of connectivity (see \nAmin and Thrift, 1997). The network society is the connection of points as \nmuch as the state-system of modern Europe, and by extension the world, \never was. Globalisation \u2013 ontologically \u2013 rests upon exactly the same idea of \n 19 \nhomogeneous, calculable space. It is, effectively, a continuation of Cartesian \nthought by other means. What may have happened is that the abstract space \nwe have imposed over the world is taken more and more as real in itself, \nrather than as a reflection of something below it, something that it seeks to \nrepresent.  \n \nModern conceptions of territory are founded upon a particular ontological \ndetermination of space, which therefore requires us to rethink the \ngeographies of globalisation. The emergence of a particular way of grasping \nspace in the fifteenth to seventeenth century is still the overriding \ngeographical determination of our world. That this is played out in different, \nand to an extent, more extreme ways does not diminish the importance of its \nholding sway. The processes associated with globalisation do not, therefore, \n\u201cmark a new ontology of place\/space relations\u201d (Amin, 2002, p. 385), \nalthough we do need to think carefully about the playing out of these \nrelations. It is in these relations, with the dialectic of \ndeterritorialisation\/reterritorialisation, that the change can be seen (see Elden \n2006). Brenner has outlined the dangers of what he calls \u201cglobal territorialist \napproaches\u201d, where nothing changes except the scale, where global space is \nrepresented \u201cin a state-centric manner, as a pregiven territorial container \nwithin which globalization unfolds, rather than analyzing the historical \nproduction, reconfiguration, and transformation of this space\u201d (1999a, p. 59). \nWhile I have considerable sympathy for this work, the concentration here on \nwhat makes this space possible \u2013 and therefore allows it to be produced, \nreconfigured and transformed \u2013 both distances me from those he wishes to \ncritique, and goes further than Brenner himself.  \n \nIn this understanding, territory does not cease to be important, rather it is no \nlonger bound within a single state. Late capitalism extends the mathematical, \ncalculative understanding of territory to the entire globe. The politics of \nmeasure continues, as we continue to take the measure of the political. It is \nworth underlining that ontology is not concerned with \u201ewhat is\u201f, but with how \n\u201ewhat is\u201f is. Since the 17th century the predominant ontological understanding \n 20 \nof the world has been its calculability. If we are to make progress in \nunderstanding the geographies of globalisation in relation to their territorial, \ndeterritorialised and reterritoralised aspects, it behoves us to understand what \ntheir conditions of possibility are. The point is where to begin. \n \nBibliography \n \nAgnew, John (1995) \u201cThe Territorial Trap: The Geographical Assumptions of \nInternational Relations Theory\u201d, in John Agnew and Stuart Corbridge, \nMastering Space: Hegemony, Territory and International Political \nEconomy, London: Routledge, pp. 78-100. \nAgnew, John (1999) \u201cMapping Political Power Beyond State Boundaries: \nTerritory, Identity and Movement in World Politics\u201d, Millennium, Vol 28 \nNo 3, pp. 499-521.  \nAkerman, James R.
