Introduction \nTitanium diboride, (TiB2) is a metal-based refractory ceramic material that has been \ninvestigated in industrial applications ranging from, cutting tools to wear parts and for \napplications in the aerospace industry. The unique properties that make this material \nso fascinating are, its high hardness of 33GPa [1], its high Young\u2019s Modulus of \n480GPa [2], its high melting point of 2980 \u00b0C [3] and is corrosion resistance up to \n1400 \u00b0C [2], to name just a few. TiB2 is limited in its mainstream use because of its \ninherent brittle nature. As the demand for the fabrication of high hardness, low \ncoefficient of friction coatings increase, the needs arises for the quantification and \ncharacterisation of suitable coatings.  Multilayers, formed by the deposition of \nalternating layers of different materials that are only tens of nanometers thick, is one \nmethod employed by several authors as a route to limit crack propagation in ceramic \ncoatings [4,5].  \nIn this study, carbon, either with its graphitic or sp2 hybridised bonding, or with its sp3 \nhybridised diamond-like nature, has been employed as an interfacial material to limit \ncrack propagation in the TiB2. Carbon has been used previously for similar reasons in \nan aluminium reinforced TiB2 composite [6] and improvements in mechanical \nproperties and tensile strength are reported. An improvement in the lubricating \nproperties of TiB2 used for cutting tool applications has been reported by Baker [7]. In \nthis study, 50 layer stacks of TiB2\/C \u2013 25 layers of TiB2 and 25 layers of carbon, have \nbeen fabricated to a total thickness of 5 \u00b5m. The volume fraction of TiB2 ceramic has \nbeen varied from 50 to 95%.  \nThe deposition of TiB2 \u2013 based coatings has been carried out in the literature using a \nvariety of vapour deposition techniques, both PVD [8] and CVD [9]. In this study, DC \nmagnetron sputtering was employed as the deposition technique for the fabrication of \nTiB2\/C multilayers. As a result of the low deposition temperatures, TiB2 coatings \nfabricated by PVD show the best potential for tribological applications [8]. The \ninfluence of the volume fraction of TiB2 ceramic on mechanical properties was \ncharacterised by its Hardness and Reduced Modulus using nanoindentation. Focused \nIon Beam (FIB) milling, coupled with SEM provided metallographic confirmation of \nthe multilayer coatings. Carbon was characterised by Raman spectroscopy. \n \n \n2. Experimental \n2.1 Sample preparation \nIn this work, TiB2\/C multilayer coatings were deposited onto AISI 1095 tool steel \nsubstrates. The substrates were prepared using a series of polishing wheels that had \nvarious \u2018grit\u2019 sizes ranging from 250 \u00b5m to 1 \u00b5m. The substrates were finished using \na colloidal silicon slurry, which provided a mirror finish to the tool steel. The tool \nsteel was then cleaned in a re-flux solvent for 30 minutes with IPA as the cleaning \nagent.  \n2.2 PVD sputtering \nThe PVD sputtering machine was a multi-target system with a rotary worktable. The \nmachine is diffusion pumped to a base pressure better than 10-6 torr. \nMultilayers of TiB2\/C were fabricated using conventional DC magnetron sputtering. \nThe carbon and TiB2 sputtering targets were 7cm in diameter with a purity of 99.99%. \nThe power density on the TiB2 target was approximately 8.1W\/cm2 and on the carbon \ntarget it was approximately 11W\/cm2. Ar was used as the process gas and was kept at \na pressure of 10 mtorr and an Ar flow of 27 sccm. During fabrication, the substrate \nworktable was biased to -200V. Biasing is known to promote ion bombardment and \nthus improve film adhesion and it is also suggested that ion bombardment may \nincrease the formation of sp3 hybridised carbon [10]. \n2.3 Nanoindentation \nNanoindentation was carried out using a Nanotest 550, equipped with a Berkovitch \nindenter [11]. For the samples fabricated in this study, 5 indents were made per \nsample, with loads ranging from 50 to 400 mN to a maximum depth of 1800 nm. The \nincreasing load procedure had 8 steps with a load rate of 2mN\/sec with a dwell time \nof 15s on the highest load. Elastic contributions were determined from the unloading \ncurves and were used for the calculation of the Reduced Modulus. The mathematical \nmodel employed to analyse the data, was the Olivier and Pharr method [11]. The \nmethod was used to determine two mechanical properties - the Hardness and the \nReduced Elastic Modulus.  \nHardness is defined as the resistance of a material to plastic deformation, usually by \nindentation. Mathematically, hardness is defined as the maximum load divided by the \nprojected area of the indenter in contact with the sample at the maximum load as can \nbe seen in equation [1]  \ncA\nPH max=    [1] \nWhere: \nH= Hardness  \nPmax=maximum applied load  \nAc = projected contact area at the maximum applied load \n \nThe indenter tip is not rigid during indentation, therefore the elastic modulus can not \nbe directly determined from the load-displacement curves. However, the reduced \nelastic modulus can be determined from the unloading portion of the curve by the \nfollowing relation. Mathematically, the reduced elastic modulus is given by equation \n[2]:  \ni\ni\nr EEE\n22 111 \u03bd\u03bd \u2212+\u2212=    [2] \nWhere:  \nEr = Elastic Reduced Modulus \n\u03c5 = Poisson ratio of the specimen\/coating \nE = Elastic modulus of the specimen\/coating \n\u03c5i = Poisson ratio of the indenter \nEi =Elastic modulus of the indenter \n \nThe TiB2\/C multilayers were formed by alternating the film growth between two \ndifferent materials. The coating thickness was kept constant at 5 \u00b5m; however, the % \nof TiB2 in the coating was varied from 50 to 95% by volume by varying the thickness \nof the layers.  \n2.4 Raman spectroscopy \nRaman spectroscopy was carried out using \"Dilor Labram 1B\" Raman Microprobe \n(Instruments SA, UK). Laser excitation was provided with a 17mW HeNe laser, at an \nexcitation wavelength of 632.8 nm. The spectra were obtained from 1000 to 2000cm-1 \nin steps of 0.8cm-1. Raman spectroscopy was conducted at several points on the \nsubstrate surface and an average Raman spectrum obtained. Lorentzian fits to the \nRaman data obtained for carbon peaks at 1170cm-1, 1360cm-1, 1490cm-1 and 1580cm-\n1 provided an excellent fit to the Raman spectra of the deposited carbon layers.  \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1 Carbon characterisation \nRaman spectroscopy conducted in the visible range provides information on the sp2 \nhybridised constituents of amorphous carbon films, and studies have shown that \nHighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), has a peak around 1580 cm-1 with a \nFWHM (full width-half maximum) of 16.3 cm-1[12]. This peak is referred to as the G \npeak and originates from the E2g symmetry graphite chains and clusters. Amorphous \ncarbon has an additional peak in its Raman spectra, referred to as the D peak, at \naround 1355 cm-1, which originates from the A1g mode of the crystal [13] .  Naturally \noccurring diamond has a peak at 1332 cm-1 with a FWHM of 2.6 cm-1. Raman studies \nconducted on diamond-like carbon films have two peaks relating to the amount of sp3 \ndisorder and sp2 graphitic components in the film. Robertson and O\u2019Reilly have \nproposed a structural model of the amorphous carbon [14], in which they suggest that \nDLC consists of mainly sp3 bonds and as the graphitic component of the carbon \nincreases, the number of sp2 bonds increase. Thus, the integrated intensity ratio of the \nD and G peaks, (ID\/IG) plays an important role in determining film properties. By \ncalculating the intensity of the D and G peaks from Raman spectra, inferences can be \nmade as to the type of film deposited. A high ID\/IG ratio leads to DLC behaviour [14]. \nFor the carbon fabricated in this study, the ID\/IG ratio is 1.08, indicating the presence \nof sp3 hybridised bonding at about the 50% level in the coating.  \nFerrari [15] and Silva [16] agreed that simple two-symmetric-line fits to the \ncharacteristic Raman D and G peaks are not always suitable to fit spectra. Symmetric \nmultipeak fits are found to provide a much better fit to the data. Figure 1 shows a \nRaman spectra from carbon fabricated in this study. In this study, a D peak around \n1330 cm-1, a G peak at 1590 cm-1, plus additional peaks at 1170 and 1500cm-1 were \nnecessary to accurately fit the data. Additional peaks in the Raman spectra around \n1100-1220 cm-1 have been associated with hexagonal diamond [17,16]. The Raman \npeak at 1500 cm-1 has been attributed to the semicircle stretching of carbon atoms in \nsingle aromatic rings [18]. \n3.2 TiB2\/C multilayers \nTiB2\/C coatings were fabricated maintaining a constant composition wavelength (sum \nof two layers [\u03bb] =200nm), for an array of ceramic fractions ranging from, 50% by \nvolume, to 95% by volume. The thickness of individual carbon layers varied between \n10nm and 100nm. The thickness of the TiB2 ceramic layers varied between 100nm \nand 190nm. Table 1 summarises the experiments carried out and the thicknesses of \nthe individual layers. The Hardness and Reduced Modulus as a function of indent \ndepth for all composition of films, at variable loads ranging from 50 to 400mN, is \nshown in figures 2 and 3, respectively. From the Hardness results, it can be seen that \nthe Hardness ranges from about 5 GPa for the 100nm\/100nm (50% TiB2), to about 17 \nGPa for the 190nm\/10nm (95% TiB2). It is also worth pointing out that the \nenhancement in Hardness of the TiB2\/C as the TiB2 content is increased from 50 to \n95%, is due to the layer thicknesses\u2019 involved in this study. During indentation, \nseveral of the TiB2\/C layers become indented and thus the Hardness values are the \nresult of the indentation penetrating several layers. The monolayer result of the \nHardness shown in figure 2 is that of pure TiB2 and shows that it has a hardness \nexceeding 24 GPa. By comparison, the 190nm\/10nm TiB2\/C sample has a Hardness \nof 17 GPa.  \nThe values of Hardness for all TiB2 ceramic compositions are seen to converge to a \nsingle value, approaching that of the substrate as the indentation depth is increased. \nAlso shown on the graphs is the data obtained from Cruz [19] for fabricated 50 \u2013 layer \nof TiB2\/Al stacks. The Hardness and Reduced Modulus is seen to follow the same \ntrends, converging towards the hardness value of the AISI 1095 substrate with \nincrease in indentation depth.  \nFigure 4 shows the variation in the Hardness as a function of volume fraction of \ncarbon. The Hardness is seen to decrease as a function of increasing carbon content. A \nsimilar observation has been made by Baker et al., [7], where the Hardness of a \nTiB2\/C multilayer decreased from 40 GPa for a 100 nm TiB2 sub layer thickness, to \n25 GPa for a 1 nm TiB2 sub layer thickness. It has been demonstrated that the number \nof interfaces, total coating thickness and substrate type all influence the measured \nHardness values [20] and thus accounts for the differences in the Hardness values \nobtained in this study. Baker et al., [7] concluded from their findings that carbon \npreferentially bonds as Ti(B, C)2 and DLC only forms when the Ti(B,C)2 has become \nsaturated. This saturation decreases the hard TiB2 phase content and increases the \nsofter carbon lubricating phase. From wear measurements they measured a friction \ncoefficient of better than 0.2. For the reduced modulus data, it was observed that at \nthe 50% TiB2 volume fraction the reduced modulus increases a function of \nindentation depth, from 130 GPa to 210 GPa. By comparison, the 95% TiB2 volume \nfraction is seen to remain overall constant at around 210 GPa. \nConclusions \n\u2022 A series of 50 layer stacks of alternate layers of TiB2\/C have been fabricated \nas 5 micron thick coatings using DC magnetron sputtering with a range of \nTiB2 volume fractions ranging from 50% to 95%.  \n\u2022 Multilayering has overcome the inherent brittleness of TiB2 when deposited as \na coating. \n\u2022 The Hardness varies from 5 GPa for the 50% TiB2 ceramic to 17GPa for the \n95% TiB2 ceramic.  \n\u2022 A comparison made with a similar 50 \u2013 layer TiB2\/Al material system, show \nthat the Hardness behaviour is similar, dominated by the TiB2 volume fraction. \n\u2022 As the carbon volume fraction is increased, the hardness is seen to decrease, \nand this decrease has been attributed to carbon layers not being load bearing, \nbut acting as a lubricant in a TiB2\/C multilayer system. \n \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National Physical \nLaboratory (NPL) under DTI Project CPM2.4: Characterisation and performance of \nmaterials: multi-layered coatings.
