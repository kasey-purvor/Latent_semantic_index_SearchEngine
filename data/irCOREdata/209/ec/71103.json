Introduction\n[2] When a coronal mass ejection (CME) hits the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere the dayside magnetopause is compressed\ntoward the Earth. At geostationary orbit increases or\ndecreases in relativistic electron fluxes are observed\n[Reeves, 1998] depending on the severity of the shock\nassociated with the CME, and a complex interplay between\nloss and acceleration processes [Horne and Thorne, 2003].\nEnergetic electrons are believed to be lost from geostation-\nary orbit (and the outer radiation belt generally) by three\npossible mechanisms: (1) adiabatic motion; (2) magneto-\npause encounters; and (3) precipitation into the atmosphere\n[Lorentzen et al., 2001; Green et al., 2004; O\u2019Brien et al.,\n2004; Selesnick, 2006]. Adiabatic motion caused by the\nstretching of magnetospheric field lines during a magnetic\nstorm, known as the Dst effect, has been suggested as the\nprimary cause of the flux decreases but does not lead to a\npermanent loss of electrons. However, recent work by\nUkhorskiy et al. [2006] has indicated that storm time\nintensification of the ring current produces an expansion\nof electron drift orbits such that their paths intersect the\nmagnetopause leading to rapid electron loss. Precipitation\ninto the atmosphere of electrons driven into the bounce loss\ncone has also been suggested as the primary loss mecha-\nnism, through interaction with electron cyclotron harmonic\nwaves [Horne and Thorne, 2000], electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC) waves [Summers and Thorne, 2003], or\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A12206, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012395, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Physical Sciences Division, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, Dartmouth College, Hanover,\nNew Hampshire, USA.\n4Space Sciences Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, California, USA.\n5Department of Earth and Space Science, University of Washington,\nSeattle, Washington, USA.\n6Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory, University of Oulu, Sodankyla\u00a8,\nFinland.\n7Space Plasma Environment and Radio Science Group, Department of\nCommunication Systems, University of Lancaster, Lancaster, UK.\n8Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary,\nAlberta, Canada.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2007JA012395$09.00\nA12206 1 of 12\nwhistler waves [Horne and Thorne, 2003], either separately\nor in combination.\n[3] This paper describes the geographic and temporal\nvariability of the loss of electrons to the atmosphere, as a\nresult of the CME on 21 January 2005. Relativistic Electron\nPrecipitation (REP) into the atmosphere has been observed\nto take several forms. Clilverd et al. [2006] showed that a\nseries of bursts of precipitation into the middle atmosphere,\neach lasting several minutes, could be observed following\nthe CME of 21 January 2005. Precipitation events lasting\nminutes to hours have previously been observed from the\nMeV Auroral X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy (MAXIS)\nballoon. They were observed between L = 4\u20137, in the late\nafternoon\/dusk sector, and may be produced by EMIC\nwaves [Millan et al., 2002]. Loss rates suggest that these\nminute-hour events are a primary loss mechanism for outer\nzone relativistic electrons. During the 21 January 2005\nCME event the total precipitation into the atmosphere could\naccount for up to 50% of the >2 MeVelectron flux losses in\nthe outer radiation belt at the time [Clilverd et al., 2006].\n[4] When energetic electrons precipitate into the atmo-\nsphere they ionize the neutral atmosphere constituents,\nchanging the existing electron density altitude profiles,\ndriving chemical reactions, and generating bremsstrahlung\nX-rays from the collisions. The altitude at which the\nionization occurs is dependent on the energy of the particle,\nwith more energetic particles penetrating deeper into the\natmosphere, e.g., 500 keVelectrons produce peak ionization\nrates at \u000170 km altitude. When a CME occurs in the\npresence of a solar proton event both precipitating electrons\nand protons can be present at the same time. Different\ninstruments will observe the precipitation driven ionization\nincreases in different ways.\n[5] Riometers [Little and Leinbach, 1959] will observe\nthe integrated absorption of cosmic radio noise through the\nionosphere, with increased absorption due to additional\nionization due to both proton and electron precipitation.\nThey have previously been shown to respond to the effects\nof CMEs [Brown et al., 1961; Osepian and Kirkwood,\n2004]. The dominant altitude of the absorption is typically\nin the range 70\u2013100 km i.e., biased toward relatively soft\nparticle energies (>30 keV electrons), though significant\nsolar proton precipitation (>10 MeV) will drive this altitude\nlower. Subionospheric VLF radio wave receivers that re-\nceive oblique incident radio waves are affected by the\nlowest altitude of significant ionization, thus the dominant\naltitude is set by the highest particle energies where there\nare significant high-energy fluxes. If the electron precipita-\ntion energies are high enough to penetrate lower into the\natmosphere than the proton precipitation, then variations in\nradio propagation conditions will be dominated by the\nelectron precipitation. The opposite is true if the proton\nenergies are dominant. Balloon-borne instruments detect\nbremsstrahlung radiation (20 keV\u201310 MeV) caused during\nenergetic particle collision with the neutral atmosphere. The\ninstruments are biased toward the highest energy precipita-\ntion present because the particles scatter at the lowest\naltitudes, and are relatively insensitive to low-energy pre-\ncipitation particularly when high-energy precipitation is\noccurring.\n[6] In this study we analyze ground-based ionospheric\ndata from midlatitudes and high latitudes during the arrival\nof a coronal mass ejection on 21 January 2005. We\ninvestigate the geographical spread of precipitation into\nthe atmosphere as a result of the shock, and attempt to\nidentify the processes that have driven it. We combine data\nfrom subionospheric VLF radio wave receivers, the high-\naltitude Miniature Spectrometer (MINIS) balloons, riome-\nters, and pulsation magnetometers to describe the geographic\nand temporal variability of energetic particle precipitation\ninto the middle atmosphere during the first hour of the\nevent. We particularly concentrate on describing the balloon\nand radio wave data because of their predisposition to\nmonitor the impact of relativistic electron precipitation\nduring this study period. We show that following the shock\narrival there are significant differences in energetic particle\nprecipitation between the dayside and the nightside driven\nby different wave-particle interactions, as well as significant\ndifferences in latitudinal structure.\n2. Event Conditions on 21 January 2005\n[7] An X7 solar flare at 0600 UT on 20 January 2005 was\nfollowed in about 20 min by an unusually hard solar proton\nevent. Recovery of the ionosphere due to the declining\nlevels of proton flux was well underway late on 21 January\nwhen an associated CME triggered a Kp = 8, Dst \u0002\u0003100 nT\ngeomagnetic storm, leading to a relativistic electron dropout\nat geosynchronous orbit starting at \u00011710 UT. By 18 UT\nGOES-10 and GOES-12 > 2 MeV electron fluxes had\ndecreased by 3 orders of magnitude. The solar wind\nassociated with the CME showed an increase from 600 to\n900 km\/s and a density change from 6 to 16 protons cm\u00033 in\nless than 2 min (http:\/\/www.srl.caltech.edu\/ACE\/ASC\/\nlevel2\/swepam_l2desc.html). The shock was observed at\nACE at 1648 UT, and the propagation time to Earth was\nabout 23 min, indicating an expected CME arrival time\nof 1711 UT in our data.\n[8] In Figure 1 the changes in solar wind H+ speed and\ndensity associated with the CME shock are shown. The data\nhave been delayed by 23 min in order to represent the travel\ntime from the ACE satellite to Earth. The lower panel shows\nthe impact of the CME on the GOES relativistic electron\nfluxes measured at geostationary orbit.\n3. Experimental Setup\n[9] This paper combines data from subionospheric VLF\nradio wave receivers, the high-altitude MINIS balloons,\nriometers, and pulsation magnetometers to describe the\ngeographic and temporal variability of energetic particle\nprecipitation into the middle atmosphere during the first\nhour of the event. This section describes the setup of each\ninstrument, and relevance to this study. Clilverd et al.\n[2006] described observations showing energetic particle\nprecipitation lasting 2.7 h from the CME event; however,\nhere we just concentrate on the initial period which shows\nthe immediate effects of the shock arrival.\n[10] Here we use narrow band subionospheric VLF\/LF\ndata spanning 20\u201340 kHz received at three sites: Sodan-\nkyla\u00a8, Finland (67\u0001N, 23\u0001E, L = 5.2); Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard\n(79\u0001N, 11\u0001E, L = 18.3); and Halley, Antarctica (76\u0001S, 26\u0001W,\nL = 4.7). These sites are part of the Antarctic-Arctic\nRadiation-belt Dynamic Deposition VLF Atmospheric\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n2 of 12\nA12206\nResearch Konsortia (AARDDVARK, see the description\nof the array at http:\/\/www.physics.otago.ac.nz\/space\/\nAARDDVARK_homepage.htm). The effects of changing\nionization conditions in the mesosphere, due to energetic\nparticle precipitation, can be observed along the propa-\ngation path between a transmitter and a receiver. Subiono-\nspheric propagation is sensitive to ionization located\nbelow about 90 km. The effect of increased ionization\non the propagating signals can be seen as either an\nincrease or decrease in signal amplitude or phase depend-\ning on the modal mixture of each signal observed [Barr\net al., 2000].\n[11] The MINIS balloon project launched six balloons in\nJanuary 2005 to observe the size, frequency and mecha-\nnisms of relativistic electron precipitation. The campaign\nstaggered the launches in order to extend the longitudinal\nrange over which relativistic electron precipitation could be\nobserved. These balloons were launched from the South\nAfrican Antarctic station, SANAE (72\u0001S, 2\u0001W) and\nChurchill, Canada (58.76\u0001N, 265.91\u0001E). The balloons car-\nried Sodium Iodide (Nal) X-ray scintillation detectors used\nto detect Bremsstrahlung radiation (20 keV\u201310 MeV)\ncaused during energetic particle collision with the neutral\natmosphere, particularly those collisions at altitudes of 40\u2013\n60 km. The MINIS balloon experiment observed significant\nX-ray counts from 1710 to 1740 UT on 21 January 2005.\nMost of the fluxes were observed from balloons at L = 3.5\nand L = 4.1 in the Southern Hemisphere, although the first\nburst at 1712 UTwas also seen by a balloon at L = 10 in the\nNorthern Hemisphere (E. A. Bering III and the MINIS\nTeam, Multiple balloon observations of relativistic electron\nloss and associated electric and magnetic perturbations,\nIAGA Scientific Assembly 2005, IAGA2005-A-00631).\n[12] The riometers used in this study are located either in\nthe NORSTAR and MIRACLE arrays in Canada and\nScandinavia respectively, or at Halley, Antarctica (76\u0001S,\n26\u0001W, and L = 4.5). The data from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland,\n(69.02\u0001N, 20.86\u0001E) are taken from the central beam of the\nImaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) [Browne\net al., 1995], which operates at 38.2 MHz. The Canadian\nriometers are widebeam, 30 MHz, vertical pointing parallel\ndipole systems, with time resolutions of 1\u201310 s, although\nwe typically present 1 min average data. The riometer data\npresented from Pinawa (50.20\u0001N, 263.96\u0001E, and L = 4.1) in\nthe NORSTAR array are on the dayside during the CME.\nSimilarly, Rankin is also in the NORSTAR array, on the\ndayside during the CME, and located at 62.82\u0001N, 267.87\u0001E,\nL = 12.44 The IRIS riometer in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland, was in\nthe dusk sector during the CME, located at 69.02\u0001N,\n20.86\u0001E, and at L = 6.1. We also use Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 in Finland,\nwhich was also in the dusk sector, at 64.42\u0001N, 25.28\u0001E, and\nL = 3.7 and operates at 32.4 MHz.\n[13] A latitudinal chain of pulsation magnetometers is\nlocated in Finland, and operated by the Sodankyla\u00a8 Geo-\nphysical Observatory. The magnetometers range from L =\n3.4\u20136.1, and operate with a time resolution of 0.025 s. We\nare principally interested in the Nurmija\u00a8rvi site, located at\n60.51\u0001N, 24.65\u0001E, and at L = 3.4. Here we study the\nfrequency range of 0.1\u20134 Hz. In this frequency range waves\nof \u00012 Hz are thought to be generated by the EMIC\nFigure 1.

Pc 1\u20132 waves prop-\nagate along the field line, and can also be observed on the\nground [Erlandson et al., 1996]. Solar wind compressions\nof the magnetosphere can generate Pc 1 pulsations, as the\ncompressions increase the ion anisotropy which, in turn,\nincreases the EMIC wave growth rate [Kangas et al., 1986].\nAs previously mentioned, precipitation into the atmosphere\nof electrons driven into the bounce loss cone has been\nsuggested as the primary loss mechanism from the radiation\nbelts through interaction with EMIC waves [Summers and\nThorne, 2003], although conclusive experimental evidence\nshowing precipitation occurring during EMIC activity has\nyet to be reported. Arnoldy et al. [1982] found that pulsating\naurora was accompanied by Pc1 ULF waves at Siple station,\nAntarctica (L = 4.2) and closely associated with riometer\nabsorption, all potentially linked through enhanced particle\nprecipitation. Arnoldy et al. [1983] further observed that\nauroral light bursts were correlated with Pc 1 wave packets\nrecorded at Siple and suggested a mechanism of the\nacceleration and precipitation of electrons with auroral\nenergies (few keV) by EMIC waves.\n[14] Figure 2 shows the location of the radio wave\nreceiver sites (diamonds), and the transmitter-receiver paths\nthat were under study during the event period (transmitter\nlocations are given by the circles). The majority of the paths\nstudied here are in the same longitude sector as the GOES-\n12 satellite. The solid squares show the location where the\nMINIS balloons were operating and hollow squares their\nequivalent conjugate based on the International Geomag-\nnetic Reference Field (IGRF) magnetic field model. Riom-\neter sites which provided data for this study are shown by\ntriangles, and the pulsation magnetometer site by a star. The\nlocation of the sunrise\/sunset terminator are also shown\n(dotted line), America and Antarctica are daylit during the\nevents. The CME occurred during the Northern Hemisphere\nwinter, with North America being close to midday, and\nEurope being in the evening\/dusk sector. The observations\nmade in Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere were fully\nsunlit, and close to midday as well. Additional data from an\nAustralian site is included later in the study. Australia was\nclose to midnight at the time of the CME.\n4. Results\n4.1. Dayside Observations (10\u201315 MLT)\n[15] In this section we describe the dayside precipitation\ncharacteristics during the CME. Figure 3 shows Northern\nHemisphere riometer data from Rankin (L = 12.4), Pinawa\n(L = 4.1), and radio wave data from North Dakota (NDK,\n25.2 kHz) received at Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory\n(SGO), Finland, where the transmitter-receiver great circle\npath stretches from L = 3\u201315. The time axis covers the first\nhour of the CME event. The solid vertical dashed line shows\nthe start of the CME arrival associated precipitation in all\nthree panels. The precipitation at onset is seen at both\nriometers at L \u0002 12 and L \u0002 4 (1712 UT, \u00011030 MLT),\nand also occurs on the MINIS balloon at L = 10 (1712 UT,\n\u0001 1230 MLT, not shown). Both Rankin and the L = 10\nballoon do not observe any significant variations following\nthe initial pulse which is consistent with their high-latitude\nlocations, and field line positioning outside the dayside\nmagnetosphere (e.g., open field lines). Note that the con-\nsistently higher absorption at Rankin (L = 12.4) is a\nconsequence of the solar proton precipitation resulting in\npolar cap absorption. Pinawa (L = 4.1) is sufficiently\nequatorward to be inaccessible to the bulk of the solar\nproton flux because of the influence of geomagnetic rigidity\ncutoffs [Rodger et al., 2006].\n[16] In Figure 3 three additional vertical dashed lines\nhave been added to identify periods where bursts of pre-\ncipitation have occurred. The bursts are seen on the Pinawa\nriometer (L = 4.1) and the radio wave data from the nearby\nNorth Dakota transmitter, and are \u000114 min apart, lasting\nabout 50 min in all. The signatures in the radio wave data\nsuggest that some of the electron precipitation is at high\nenergies (>400 keV) in order for them to dominate over the\nFigure 2.

The day\/night terminator is also shown by a dotted line.

Each burst of precip-\nitation appears to last longer, extending from the initial\n\u00016 min, to \u000115 min by the fourth burst. This is consistent\nwith the idea that lower energy electrons are taking longer\neach time to come into the field of view. A comparison\nbetween the reducing levels of radio wave amplitude effects\nand the increasing riometer absorption levels for each\nsuccessive burst suggests that the precipitation disperses\nin time, and softens in energy spectra. Figure 1 indicates\nthat there is no clear signature of a periodic driver in the\nsolar wind that could be causing periodicity in the precip-\nitation bursts.\n[17] Measurements made during the CME on the South-\nern Hemisphere dayside are shown in Figure 4. The data\nspan a range of 3.5 < L < 5. A solid vertical line, and three\nvertical dashed lines have been added to identify the times\nwhen bursts of precipitation were observed in the Northern\nHemisphere data. The MINIS balloon measurements during\nthe study period were made northeast of Halley, Antarctica\n(76\u0001N, 26\u0001W, \u000115 MLT), while the radio wave data was\ntaken from the Hawaii transmitter (NPM, 21.4 kHz) to the\nwest of Halley (\u000112 MLT). The region of sensitivity of the\nHawaii-Halley path is shown as a heavy line on the path in\nFigure 2, and results from increased propagation sensitivity\nto boundary conditions over the thick ice shelf of Antarctica\n[Clilverd et al., 2005].\n[18] Widebeam riometer data from Halley is also shown\nin Figure 4, representing precipitation at L = 4.5. The shock\nonset and first additional precipitation burst are reasonably\ntimed with respect to the bursts observed in the Northern\nHemisphere, although there is clearly additional precipita-\ntion being detected in the region around Halley. The MINIS\nballoon data contains some data gaps due to the loss of the\nFigure 3. Dayside Northern Hemisphere data from the Rankin and Pinawa riometers and the radio wave\ndata from North Dakota for 1700\u20131818 UT on 21 January 2005.

The L shells that the observations were made at\nare indicated.\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n5 of 12\nA12206\nIridium satellite connection, but the L = 4.1 balloon shows\nevent occurrence that is consistent with the Northern Hemi-\nsphere timing. The L = 3.5 balloon is largely unaffected and\nmay therefore represent a lower L shell limit for this behavior.\nThe Balloon MLT (15\u201316 MLT) during this event is approx-\nimately the same as that given for Halley although they are\nlocated slightly east of the station at the time (see Figure 1).\n[19] The radio wave data shown in the upper panel\nsimilarly identifies the initial burst of energetic precipitation\nat the same time as all of the instruments, but thereafter only\nindicates that some precipitation is occurring in the region\nwest of Halley. This is primarily because of the combination\nof local precipitation overlapping with the large-scale bursts\nof precipitation, and the smearing effect of the Hawaii to\nHalley path looking over a large range of longitudes.\nOverall, the Southern Hemisphere dayside data also shows\nburst activity lasting about 50 min caused by energetic\nelectron precipitation, and the timing characteristics are the\nsame as those in the Northern Hemisphere.\n[20] In order to compare the riometer and balloon data\nmore closely we analyze a shorter period in detail. Figure 5\nshows the period between 1718 and 1745 UT. Four signif-\nicant peaks in L = 4.5 riometer absorption can be seen in the\nperiod, identified on the plot as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of the\npeaks are captured in the balloon data, although peak 4 is\nmissing in the L = 4.1 balloon because of a data gap. Peaks\n2 and 3 are seen in the L = 4.1 balloon data, but only as a\nsharp increase in X-ray count rate at the very beginning of\nthe event. The duration of each event is typically 1 min in\nthe balloon data in contrast to 4 min in the riometer data.\nThe balloon-borne experiment observes the production of\nbremsstrahlung ionization continuously overhead for\n\u00011 min. Any low-altitude recombination of the ionization\nis extremely fast at low altitudes, and the end of the event is\nmost likely to be associated with the end of the precipita-\ntion. The riometer responds to the production and decay of\nthe additional ionization from higher altitudes during the\nprecipitation event. Peak 4 is seen as a short-lived event by\nthe riometer and the L = 3.5 balloon, and is spread over a\nlarger range of L shells than events 2 and 3. Further work is\nplanned on the response of these two instruments during the\nthree last peaks identified here.\nFigure 4. Dayside Southern Hemisphere data recorded in Antarctica from 1700 to 1818 UT on 21\nJanuary 2005. Radio wave data from Hawaii, recorded at Halley, and data from two MINIS balloons are\nshown.

The L\nshells that the observations were made at are indicated on the plot.\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n6 of 12\nA12206\n4.2. Duskside Observations (\u000120 MLT)\n[21] In this section we describe the duskside precipitation\ncharacteristics during the CME. Figure 6 shows Northern\nHemisphere riometer data from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (L = 6.1), Jyva\u00a8s-\nkyla\u00a8 (L = 3.7), both in Finland, and radio wave data from\nIceland (NRK, 37.5 kHz) and Germany (DHO, 23.4 kHz)\nboth received at SGO, Finland (L = 5\u20136, and L = 2.5\u20135 for\nthe span of the paths respectively). Again, the time axis\ncovers the first hour of the CME event. The solid vertical\nline shows the start of CME precipitation in all four panels\n(1712 UT, \u000120 MLT).\n[22] At about L \u00016 the riometer and the radio wave data\nare very consistent. They both show the initial burst of\nenergetic precipitation at the start of the CME event, but\nwithin 10\u201315 min there are no signs of any further\ndisturbances. The elevated background absorption levels\non the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi riometer are consistent with a quasi-\nconstant background of ionization from the solar proton\nevent. These observations are interpreted as indicating that a\nburst of precipitation occurred as the magnetosphere was\ncompressed to L \u0001 6, but afterward that there was no\nsignificant influence of the solar wind dynamics, primarily\nbecause of the region being on the duskside of the Earth.\n[23] At L \u0001 4, shown by Jyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 at L = 3.7, the picture\nappears quite similar with a burst of enhanced ionization at\nthe start of the CME, followed by a relatively flat response\nuntil a small absorption event at about 1810 UT. However,\nthe DHO-SGO radio wave data from the propagation path\nthat spans 2.5 < L < 5.2 (Germany to Finland) there is a\nclear signature of energetic precipitation occurring from the\nonset of the CME arrival, and lasting about 50 min. On the\nplot the near-horizontal dashed line has been added to\nprovide a representation of the likely nondisturbed ampli-\ntude levels using quiet time data from before and after the\nstorm period. In Figure 7 we contrast the phase and\namplitude data from the DHO-SGO path with data taken\nfrom the NLK-Ny A\u02dalesund path (Seattle to Svalbard)\nrecorded during the X45 solar flare on 4 November 2003,\nalso known as Thomson\u2019s Great Flare [Thomson et al.,\n2005]. As before, near-horizontal lines have been added to\nthe panels to indicate the likely phases and amplitudes that\nwould have occurred if the enhanced ionization had not\nbeen present. The similarity between the two events is\nstriking, and clearly show that in the same way as a very\nlarge solar flare, the CME event lead to sustained period of\nenhanced ionization on the nightside and not the bursts of\nprecipitation-induced ionization which we observe on the\ndayside. The phase and amplitude data show us that the\npeak in precipitation flux on the DHO-SGO path was at\n1721 UT, and the event lasted from 1712\u20131757 UT. The\nlack of this signature in the Jyvaskyla riometer data suggests\nthe possibility that the energetic precipitation is only occur-\nring for 2.5 < L < 3.7.\n[24] An energetic precipitation event lasting \u000145 min is\nconsistent with the length of precipitation events reported\nby the MAXIS balloon experiment [Millan et al., 2002],\nalthough the L shell range in this event is lower than the\nrange of 4 < L < 7 that MAXIS was primarily observing.\nMillan et al. [2002] proposed EMIC waves as the possible\nprecipitation driver, due to the balloon-observed L shell\nrange and local time dependence of the precipitation events\nobserved. In Figure 8 we show the pulsation magnetometer\ndata from Nurmija\u00a8rvi, Finland, located at 60.51\u0001N, 24.65\u0001E,\nL = 3.4. Strong Pc-1 waves in the frequency range 0.5\u20132.5\nHz were detected following the CME, lasting until 1806 UT.\nThe EMIC wave power began in the frequency range 0.5\u2013\n1.0 Hz from 1714\u20131732 UT, followed by a sudden change\nto 2.0\u20132.5 Hz which lasted for the remainder of the event\n(\u000130 min more). At the top of the plot we show the mean\nEMIC wave power in the band 0.5\u20133 Hz. The noise floor\nprior to the arrival of the CME is defined at the 0 dB level.\nThe peak EMIC wave power is observed at 1720 (17.33)\nUT which is consistent with the timing of the maximum\nelectron precipitation effect observed on the DHO-SGO\npath, i.e., Figure 7.\n[25] The EMIC was measured simultaneously at every\nstation in the latitudinal array in Finland. The highest power\nwas seen at the southern most station (Nurmija\u00a8rvi) indicat-\ning that the EMIC wave was generated on a low-latitude\nfield line, either near L = 3.4 or lower and that the wave\npropagated long distances in the ionosphere. The polariza-\ntion of the wave was predominantly left handed, again\nconfirming the EMIC source. The duration and latitude of\nthe EMIC is entirely consistent with the continuous precip-\nitation observed in the DHO-SGO radio wave data, and the\nEMIC waves are therefore a strong candidate as the cause of\nthe precipitation observed.\nFigure 5. Dayside Southern Hemisphere data recorded in\nAntarctica from 1718 to 1745 UT on 21 January 2005.\nComparisons are shown of data from the two MINIS\nballoons and the Halley riometer.\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n7 of 12\nA12206\n4.3. Nightside Observations (\u00010430 MLT)\n[26] In this section we briefly describe the nightside\nprecipitation characteristics during the CME. Figure 9\nshows Southern Hemisphere riometer data from Macquarie\nIsland (54.50\u0001S, 158.95\u0001E, and L = 5.4), south of Australia.\nThe CME arrived at the Earth at \u00010430 MLT at this\nlongitude. A clear signature of the initial burst of precipi-\ntation can be seen at 1712 UT confirming that this feature is\nobserved all of the way around the Earth. Additional\nprecipitation at this longitude occurs following the CME,\nbut does not have any of the same temporal characteristics\nof the dayside riometer data. With no coincident radio\nwave or MINIS balloon data in this longitude sector at this\ntime it is difficult to describe the spectral makeup of the\nprecipitation.\n[27] Radio wave data recorded between New Zealand and\nAustralia at this time, simply indicates that there was no\nsignature of precipitation during this event for L < 2.7 (N. R.\nThomson, personal communication, 2007). Which is con-\nsistent with the L shell range, 3 < L < 12, already suggested\nfor the initial burst of precipitation.\n5. Discussion and Summary\n[28] Energetic particle precipitation into the middle atmo-\nsphere occurred in three different ways as a result of the\nCME at 1712 UT on 21 January 2005. In Figure 10 we\nsummarize the regions affected by precipitation during the\nfirst hour following the arrival of the CME. The likely\nprecipitation mechanisms are indicated in the key. The most\ncommonly observed form of precipitation was a burst at the\nonset of the CME arrival lasting about 5\u20138 min. This was\nobserved by all the instruments involved in this study, and\ncovered a large range of L shells (at least 3 < L < 12), as\nwell as daytime and nighttime longitudes. Thus electrons\nfrom the outer radiation belt were lost to the atmosphere\nover a large region of the Earth following the arrival of the\nCME shock. The burst of energetic electron precipitation\nFigure 6. Nightside Northern Hemisphere data from 1700 to 1818 UT on 21 January 2005. Radio wave\ndata from Iceland and Germany, recorded at Sodankyla\u00a8, Finland, and data from two Finnish riometers are\nshown. The L shells that the observations were made at are indicated.\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n8 of 12\nA12206\nwas energetic enough to generate significant additional\nionization at lower altitudes than the ongoing solar proton\nprecipitation event, and also lower than the altitude of the\ndaytime lower ionosphere on the dayside at \u000172 km. This\ntypically requires electron energies of >400 keV. The\nmechanism driving the precipitation is likely to be due to\nthe sudden compression of the magnetospheric field lines\nwhen the solar wind pressure increased. The initial pulse of\nenergetic electron precipitation clearly affected a wide part\nof the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. On the basis of our experimental\nmeasurements, the minimum extent that roughly spanned\nL = 3 to 12, both hemispheres, and all longitudes (360\u0001\nin extent), translates to \u000115% of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nat 100 km.\n[29] On the dayside of the Earth (10\u201315 MLT) the CME\nproduced a series of precipitation bursts, following the\ninitial burst. The time delay between each successive\nprecipitation burst was approximately the same (\u000114 min).\nThe bursts are observed to last for \u000150 min after the CME\narrival onset, and then die away. The times of the end of\neach burst of precipitation appears to be increasingly\ndelayed with respect to the start, and they suggest a period\nof \u000117 min. The longer duration of enhanced absorption\nwith each successive burst is also consistent with the energy\ndispersion that would occur in a recurring population of\ndrifting electrons.\n[30] These observations are consistent with the idea that\nthe precipitation is being caused by a recurring body of\nparticles that are in a drift orbit around the Earth at L \u0001 4.\nUsing expressions from Walt [1994], we find that the\nazimuthal drift period around the Earth at L = 4.0 for\n1.5 MeV electrons with a pitch angle of 90 degrees, i.e.,\nequatorially trapped, is \u000114 min, while for electrons of\n800 keV energy this is 17 min. For marginally trapped\nFigure 7.

(right) Contrast the data\nfrom Seattle (NLK) received at Ny A\u02dalesund, Svalbard, during Thomson\u2019s Great Flare of 4 November\n2003, indicating a continuous source of ionization following the CME in January 2005.\nA12206 CLILVERD ET AL.: EPP TRIGGERED BY A CME\n9 of 12\nA12206\nelectrons the 14 min drift period would equate to electrons\nenergies of \u00011 MeV.\n[31] Interestingly, the repetitive burst precipitation is not\nobserved on the duskside, suggesting that although the\nenergetic electrons are orbiting the Earth, the precipitation\nmechanism is mainly located on the dayside. The most\nlikely mechanisms for this are scattering into the loss cone\nby VLF chorus waves, or electron cyclotron harmonic\n(ECH) waves. ECH waves are typically found on the\ndayside only, and close to the magnetopause [Kennel et\nal., 1970; Anderson and Maeda, 1977]; thus they fit the\npicture of a dayside mechanism. ECH waves, though, are\nnot able to produce electron precipitation with energies of\n\u00011 MeV, as they resonate with electrons of only a few keV\n[Horne et al., 2003]. However, the broadband VLF receiver\nat Halley was detecting VLF chorus (0.5\u20132 kHz) on the\ndayside at the start of the CME. The wave signatures\ndisappeared at 1712 UT probably as a result of increased\nionospheric absorption of the chorus, rather than the chorus\nstopping itself. Chorus, especially the lower- frequency\nFigure 8.

However, at lower L\nshells 2.5 < L < 3.7 a precipitation event lasting \u000150 min is\nobserved. The precipitation is not bursty, but continuous,\npeaking at 1735 UT, i.e., \u00019 min after the CME onset. At\nthe same time a Pc-1 EMIC wave was detected at L = 3.4 in\nthe premidnight dusk sector. The EMIC wave was observed\nat 0.5\u20132.5 Hz, from 1712 to 1806 UT. EMIC waves are\nnormally observed near the plasmapause, and with KP\u0001 8 at\nthis time the plasmapause would be expected to be forced\ninward toward L = 2\u20133. These observations are consistent\nwith the generation of energetic electron precipitation at the\ninner edge of the outer radiation belt from EMIC wave\nscattering into the loss cone, and is the most direct link\nbetween EMIC activity and energetic precipitation observed\nthus far.\n[33] Acknowledgments.
