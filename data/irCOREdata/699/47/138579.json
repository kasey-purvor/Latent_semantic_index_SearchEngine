Finally,\nwe outline how our experience with the \u2018Regional Impact Simulator\u2019 serves as a test-bed for further\nstudies of stakeholder-led, regional, integrated assessment.\n1. Introduction\nExpected changes in climate (e.g. Hulme et al., 2002) due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases\nemissions (IPCC 2007) is likely to affect all sectors of society at all scales, ranging from the global to\nthe local. However, these impacts will be in addition to, or concurrent with, continuing socio-\neconomic and political changes (IPCC, 2007; Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000). Climate change impacts\non our changing future therefore need to be evaluated holistically, from multiple perspectives.\n\u201cIntegrated assessment\u201d (IA) has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as\n\u201can interdisciplinary process that combines, interprets, and communicates knowledge from diverse\nscientific disciplines from the natural and social sciences to investigate and understand causal\nrelationships within and between complicated systems\u201d (IPCC, 2001).\nThere are two main principles to integrated assessment if it is to enable decision making: (1) integrate\nover a range of relevant disciplines and sectors, and (2) provide new information about how complex\n3real-world systems might behave. As many stakeholders have the responsibility for decisions\nimplementing climate change adaptation policy at the local or regional (sub-national) level, (Shackley\nand Deanwood 2002), DETR (2000, p 138), it is the capacity to synthesize a broad range of\ninformation suited for understanding climate impacts at the regional scale that is greatly needed, a\nview supported by Dessai and Hulme (2004), Turnpenny et al. (2004) and Dempsey and Fisher (2005).\nIt follows therefore that there is a real need for tools that support decision making and policy\ndevelopment at this scale.\nThe UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) was established by the UK Government in 1997, with\nthe aim of providing a research framework for the integrated assessment of climate change impacts in\nthe UK. UKCIP works with stakeholders to co-ordinate research on how climate change might impact\nat regional and national scales and how stakeholders might adapt to these impacts. To manage\nexpectations, set achievable and acceptable goals and ensure that needs are met, we are seeing that\ndecision making processes on the whole and integrated assessments in particular are broadening the\nscope of multiple perspectives to include the perspectives of stakeholders. UKCIP, for example,\ndirectly involves stakeholders in the research. It is the stakeholders or their partners who commission\nthe research and determine the research agenda. UKCIP provides support and guidance throughout the\nprocess; it provides a bridge between stakeholders, researchers and decision-makers in government\norganisations and business.\nUKCIP supports a range of stakeholder-led and funded studies and partnerships on climate change\nimpacts and adaptation. Studies examining local-scale vulnerability to climate change have been\nundertaken in all regions of England, as well as the Devolved Administrations of Scotland and Wales,\nto encourage organisations within these areas to take notice of the need for climate change adaptation.\nAdditional sectoral studies have been conducted that address climate change impacts and adaptation at\na national level.\n4The structure and mission of UKCIP were developed through a scoping exercise (SPA and ESYS,\n1996). This scoping exercise also suggested that pilot climate impact assessments should include both\nnatural system integrated assessments of climate-induced water changes and their impacts on other\nsectors, as well as a regional integrated assessment on upland land use. These ideas led to the\n\u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West England,\u2019 or\nRegIS1, (Holman et al., 2005 a & b) which was conducted under the umbrella of UKCIP from 1999-\n2001. It assessed local and regional climate change impacts and adaptation options, and cross-sectoral\ninteractions between four major sectors driving landscape change (agriculture, biodiversity, coasts and\nfloodplains, and water resources). RegIS1 was the first regional integrated assessment (IA) in the UK\nand piloted a stakeholder-led approach.\nIn a supporting facilitative role, UKCIP has developed a \u2018standardised\u2019 framework for climate impact\nand adaptation research and provides tools to support decision making and policy development at a\nnational-level. Tools include climate scenarios (Hulme et al., 2002), national socio-economic\nscenarios (UKCIP, 2001a), a decision-making framework for adaptation (Willows and Connell, 2003)\nand a costing methodology (Metroeconomica 2004).\nHowever, \u2018what-if\u2019 tools, tools that help us think into the future and think about the later consequences\nof our choices today were lacking. RegIS1 did not have a \u2018what if\u2019 tool, but demonstrated the need for\nstakeholders to be able to \u2018see\u2019 potential cross-sectoral impacts and synthesize information from\ndiverse sources. It highlighted that the complexity of information and the complexity of the models we\nuse to organize it hindered the broad participation of the stakeholder community. The subsequent\nRegIS2 project (Holman and de Vries, 2005) is a response to this. Its aim was - adhering to the\nstakeholder-led approach of RegIS1 - to deliver a heuristic tool (Figure 1) that stakeholders could\ninstall on their own PC\u2019s and use unsupported, as and when required. The resulting Regional Impact\nSimulator (Holman et al., 2008) is the first simulation tool developed for stakeholders by stakeholders\nprovided on the UKCIP website (www.ukcip.org.uk).\n5RegIS1 = Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North\nWest England\nRegIS2 = Follow-on project to RegIS1, which developed the Regional Impact Simulator\nBeing only the second integrated assessment of the UK at the regional level, this paper considers how\nthe stakeholder-led RegIS2 project has moved IA forward and provides a preliminary evaluation of the\ntool\u2019s success from the perspective of the user community. Scientific insights gained from the tool are\nthe focus of the paper by Mokrech et al. (2008), Audsley et al. (2008), Henriques et al. (2008),\nHarrison et al. (2008) and Richards et al. (2008).\n2. The ending of RegIS1 and beginning of RegIS2\nUpon completion of RegIS1 (Holman et al., 2005 a & b) in June 2001, UKCIP hosted an end-of-\nproject workshop to reflect on the project, and discuss its results and how to further improve integrated\nassessments within UKCIP. The workshop was attended by around forty participants, including\nrepresentatives from the RegIS1 steering committee and research teams, as well as researchers,\nstakeholders and funders from around the UK. Participants were asked specifically to reflect on:\n\uf0b7 the use\/ usefulness of the assessment results to stakeholders;\n\uf0b7 issues concerning uncertainty\n\uf0b7 the user-friendliness of the results;\n\uf0b7 outstanding questions that require further research; and\n\uf0b7 recommendations for improving future integrated assessments\nFrom a conceptual point of view the stakeholder-led approach within RegIS1 made sense, but did it\nproduce better outcomes? This end-of-project workshop enabled stakeholders to reflect on scientific\ninsights gained about climate change impacts and adaptations at a regional scale, as well as on the\nstakeholder-led approach. Inevitably for RegIS1 - the first such project of its kind - the workshop\nproduced a large number of recommendations (UKCIP, 2001b) for improving future assessments,\n6including requests for modelling techniques that simplify the complexity, so called \u2018metamodels\u2019 or\n\u2018reduced form models\u2019 (Carmichael et al.. 2004). So the RegIS2 project set out to develop these\nmodelling approaches within the simulation tool, as well as further the stakeholder-led approach to\nintegrated assessment. The proceeding discussion of the RegIS2 project focuses on the simulation tool\nwithin the context of the views expressed by stakeholder and funder at the post-RegIS1 workshop\noutlined in UKCIP (2001b). In particular this paper seeks to assess:\n1. the success of the Regional Impact Simulator in meeting its objectives and in addressing the\nneeds of stakeholders;\n2. the potential contribution of the Regional Impact Simulator to stakeholder decision-making\nand learning;\n3. the management of the researcher \/ stakeholder interface within stakeholder-led projects;\n4. the lessons learnt about participatory integrated assessment;\n5. the developments needed for regional integrated assessments in the UK.\n3. Stakeholder evaluation of the Regional Impact Simulator\nThe design and development of the Regional Impact Simulator is described fully in Holman et al.,\n(2008). Of paramount importance, however, was to ensure that the simulator could be used by non-\nscience experts (Kasemir et al., 2000; Hanson et al., 2006). Therefore, an interface that was as intuitive\nas possible was built around the user and usability requirements (Pahl, 2004), not the science. The\nparticipatory design approach (Dittrich and Lindeberg, 2004) provided necessary input from\nstakeholders for interface development on their expectations and requirements (Welp, 2001; Hanson et\nal., 2006) and established (with the Steering Committee) mutually agreed-upon guiding concepts. The\nliterature as well as experiences, from researchers, UKCIP and participating stakeholders alike,\ncontributed to the guiding concepts described below:\nDesign \u2013 make it \u2018intuitive\u2019 to use and the outputs easy to understand\no The physical layout of the tool (where components are placed relative to others and\nhow the operations are presented) should closely mirror the conceptual model used to\n7think through the operations, i.e.; the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (or\nDPSIR) components (Holman et al., 2008);\no The slider bars, used to vary input parameters, should be numerically labelled and\nconvey assumptions of the model\/scenario (Schneider, 1997);\no \u2018Realistic\u2019 and plausible ranges of values for a given parameter should be used to\ngive guidance on the uncertainty associated with a scenario (Turnpenny et al.. 2004);\no Allow the user to concurrently view and compare graphical output from more than\none model or scenario (Olsson and Andersson, 2007);\no Appeal to a broad range of users, users with different priorities or values, by enabling\nprogressively detailed exploration of the topics (Dempsey and Fisher, 2005);\nSpeed - prevent users from \u2018switching off\u2019\no Avoid extensive or prolonged model set-up;\no Provide outputs rapidly;\nScale \u2013provide focus and prevent the use for detailed site analysis\/ policy analysis. While users\nshould be encouraged to study the detailed maps, this output is not suitable for detailed site\nanalysis, nor should it be confused with the policies that would accomplish those outcomes.\no Present principal outputs at a regional scale (aggregated).\no Allow the user to vary input parameters to \u2019see\u2019 the potential regional changes\n(Response)\nWith these initial guiding concepts and a rough implementation sketch (see Holman et al., 2008,\nand the pre-study stage of Dittrich and Lindeberg, 2004) a series of prototypes were developed to\nplot the evolution of user requirements and functionalities. The interface evolved to three screens,\neach with a different purpose and increasing levels of interaction with the model variables, which\nare described fully in Holman et al. (2008). The screens now provide an ordered hierarchy of user\ninteraction and, importantly, the DPSIR approach to thinking about change:\no The Predefined Scenario Futures screen allows the user to rapidly become familiar\nwith indicators and their sensitivity to the different climate and socio-economic\n8scenarios. The default set of input parameter values for each scenario allows a rapid\nmodel set-up.\no The Exploratory Analysis screen allows the user to explore a scenario in greater\ndetail, by changing the input parameter values used in the models. This enables the\nuser to explore the effects of the widely acknowledged uncertainty in any scenario,\nwhich cannot be defined by a single set of unique values.\no The Influencing the Impacts screen allows the user to test regional adaptation\nresponses to the impacts identified with the Exploratory Analysis screen. The screen\nshows the regional scale outcomes of changes (Response) rather than the policies that\nwould accomplish those outcomes, because the tool is not intended for intervention in\nspecific policy analysis.\n3.1 How successful was Regional Impact Simulator in meeting its objectives and in delivering\nthe needs of stakeholders?\nThe question of what is meant by the utility of a model for stakeholders is extensively debated in the\nliterature (e.g. Shackley. 1998). Merton (1957) first made the distinction between the \u2018manifest\u2019 and\n\u2018latent\u2019 function of models, where the manifest function (does the model provide robust answers?) is\nthe one that appears to be the legitimate explanation of the model\u2019s utility in decision-making.\nHowever, not infrequently there is also a latent function (Does the model provide consensus and\nagreement on the legitimacy of a course of action?) which lies \u2018beneath the surface\u2019 (Shackley and\nGough, 2002). However, Olsson and Andersson (2007) state that important conditions for the\nsuccessful use of models as communication tools with stakeholders are credible results, user\nrelevance, user friendliness and transparency.\nFrom a scientific perspective, RegIS2 was successful in developing computationally simpler\nmodelling techniques for integrated assessments, which produce credible results and have provided\nnew understandings (Mokrech et al., 2008; Henriques et al., 2008; Audsley et al., 2008; Harrison et al.,\n92008; Richards et al., 2008). The question asked here, however, is whether the user-friendly interface\nwas successful. Whether the stakeholder community will use the Regional Impact Simulator and the\nRegIS methodology is of paramount interest but this question cannot be answered yet. Simply\nproviding credible, quality information and tools are not enough to ensure that decision makers and\nstakeholders will used them (Dempsey and Fisher 2005). We will only be able to address this latter\nquestion now that the Regional Impact Simulator is freely available to the wider stakeholder\ncommunity through the UK Climate Impacts Programme website (www.ukcip.org.uk) and time to use\nit has elapsed.\nTo provide a preliminary assessment of interface usability, a prototype of the Regional Impact\nSimulator was made available to a group of approximately 60 volunteer stakeholders for external\nevaluation. These stakeholders were affiliated with national Government (8), regional Government (5),\nlocal Government (6), NGO\u2019s (18, ranging from National Park authorities and environmental\nregulators to sustainability fora), charities (5), commercial organizations (11, ranging from water and\npower utilities to consultancies) and academic\/research institutions (6). They came from within the\ntwo study regions, from elsewhere in the UK and from outside the UK.\nThe evaluation process was intended to provide preliminary independent feedback on the design and\nfunctionality of the Regional Impact Simulator, rather than on the numerical values of the output itself.\nAlthough users were obviously expected to install and run the tool on their won PC\u2019s, they were\nspecifically not being asked to say if, for example, the value of the river flow exceeded 95% of the\ntime in catchment X was correct or not- the technical evaluation of the models is described elsewhere\nin the Special Issue, in earlier papers (e.g. Holman et al., 2005b; Rounsevell et al., 2003; Pearson et\nal., 2002) and technical reports (Holman and Loveland, 2001, Holman and de Vries, 2005). Questions\naddressed the design and operation of the interface, the usefulness of the model outputs and potential\nfuture developments (see Appendix). Users were asked to score their answers between 1 (low) and 5\n(high) or to identify strengths and weaknesses. Eleven individuals returned evaluation forms. Their\nfeedback provided a useful provisional metric for determining whether the Regional Impact Simulator\n10\nachieved its aims. Non-responders were also followed up, of which 17 provided explanations \u2013 9 were\ntoo busy to carry out the evaluation within the given time period, 2 felt that the software wasn\u2019t\nrelevant, and 8 had IT difficulties. The latter mostly related to getting the software certified as safe\nand installed on centrally-controlled networked systems, suggesting that such problems may represent\na considerable constraint on both stakeholder participation in similar studies and stakeholder uptake of\ntools. Although not included in the quantitative evaluation exercise, positive verbal feedback has been\nreceived following demonstrations of the tool at seven stakeholder meetings and conferences within\nthe UK.\nThe key metrics of success for the interface of the simulator were:\n1. Was it deemed easy to use and intuitive by users?\n2. Were runtimes considered acceptable by users?\n3. Were the outputs useful to the users (therefore, were the indicators appropriate)?\n3.1.1 Ease of use and intuitiveness of the Interface\nAll bar one of the respondents rated the ease of use\/intuitiveness of the Interface as adequate or better\nthan adequate, although none rated it \u2018very easy\u2019 (with an average score from all respondents of 3.5).\nThere was an approximately even distribution of responses to how long it took to understand how to\nuse the Regional Impact Simulator. There was no relationship found between how long it took them to\nfigure out how to use the simulator and whether they felt the design was intuitive. About half used the\nhelp tutorial and half did not (5 used the tutorial while 6 did not). All those who required more than an\nhour to understand the interface used the help tutorial, as did some who required half an hour or less.\nIt is not possible to meet the diverse needs of all stakeholders with one design. Nevertheless, all\nrespondents did report satisfaction with the simulator, encouragement and at least partial affirmation\nfor the hierarchical three-screen layout and design.\n3.1.2 Satisfaction with the model run-time\n11\nDuring the initial design of the Regional Impact Simulator, a target run-time of 1 second was set. The\nfinal run time of 10-20 seconds is longer than this. This was due in part to the finer spatial resolution\nadopted by the flooding metamodel (1 km2 grid) and partly to the reading and writing of files between\nthe many metamodels. The runtime has also been shown (in Holman et al. 2008) to be computer-\ndependent. Nevertheless, all but 2 of the respondents rated the runtime as adequate or better than\nadequate (average score of 3.2). The least satisfied respondent replied that the \u2018maximum admissible\u2019\nruntime was 5 seconds. Although a \u2018typical\u2019 new PC results in a runtime of less than 20 seconds ( in\nHolman et al. 2008), it can be reduced to around 10 seconds when the biodiversity models are\nexcluded - the last in the cascade of metamodels.\n3.1.3 Appropriateness of the results\nThe hands-off nature of the evaluation exercise, with stakeholders installing and running the software\non their own PC\u2019s, meant that they were free to reflect on the \u2018usefulness\u2019 of the tool and its indicators\nwithin the context and remit of their own responsibilities without any possibility of implicit coercion\non the part of the research team or funder, which might arise during a mediated session. While aiming\nto appeal to a broad range of moderately technically-minded users, the Regional Impact Simulator\ncannot produce outputs suitable for all purposes. All users were interested in different specifications,\nspatial boundaries and, in some case, already employed their own standard methodologies. A generic\ntool such as the Regional Impact Simulator cannot hope to meet all expectations and needs.\nNevertheless, the evaluation of the usefulness of the Indicators and results were generally positive,\nwith all respondents rating both the usefulness of the indicators (average score of 3.8) and model\nresults (average score of 3.5) as adequate or better than adequate. Despite the differing spatial\nboundaries of the participating organizations, the value of the outputs could be seen. However, in\nreality it is likely that providing a tool which does not correspond to the boundaries of an\norganization\u2019s remit will limit its usefulness, which is partly reflected in the stakeholder feedback on\nfurther developments (Section 7).\n12\nA simulator able to meet all requirements would require customized versions linked to rather specific\nplans, policies or strategies (Demeritt and Langdon 2004) and the ability to incorporate local\nknowledge useful for interpreting and relating the results \u2019on the ground\u2019. The extensive range of\nstakeholder needs would preclude customized versions for everyone. Yet for some the case could be\nargued that the investment of time and testing with practitioner stakeholders is well worth trying.\nOverall, comments received following the evaluation suggest that users recognise the potential for the\noutputs of the Regional Impact Simulator to support a range of their activities:\n\u201cWe believe that [the Regional Impacts Simulator] has a huge potential to raise awareness of\nthe implications of policy decisions, and therefore guide policy and decision makers down\na more sustainable track\u201d\n\u201cOverall we believe it is a useful tool to demonstrate the linkages and impacts\u201d\n\u201cIt's very encouraging to see the potential solutions for many items that are put into the 'too\ndifficult' box.\u201d\n\u201ctool provides a valuable (essential) advocative medium to embed need for adaptation and\nunderpin cross sectoral policy development\/decision making\u201d\n\u201cI fully support the concept behind RegIS [the Regional Impacts Simulator]\u201d.\n4. The potential contribution of the Regional Impact Simulator to stakeholder decision-making\nand learning\nThe Regional Impact Simulator was intended to contribute to stakeholder decision-making and\nlearning by, in the first place, allowing users to visualise the impacts of climate and socio-economic\nchange. It is anticipated that the Regional Impact Simulator helps improve stakeholders\u2019\nunderstanding of climate and socio-economic impacts through visual illustrations on maps and with\ngraphs of how climate and socio-economic scenarios might affect different sectors. Secondly, it\nallows users to explore the drivers of change and their potential impacts to the landscape and to four\nareas of human activity (and decision making) and thereby give a better sense of plausible adaptation\noptions and potential consequential effects. Finally, because there are multiple interactions between\n13\nthe sectors driving landscape change, a tool to help stakeholders understand cross-sectoral issues and\nexplore different perspectives of the same issue is expected to be useful to them in exploring uncertain\nfutures and consequently the implications of their possible decisions in the broader context \u2013 a\nregional context.\nThe uncertainties that are associated with a climate change impact assessment are difficult to work\nwith. However, the Regional Impact Simulator makes this task a bit easier by giving reasonable\nboundaries to uncertainty. \u201cSlider bars\u201d (Figure 2) define the range of \u2018reasonable\u2019 uncertainty for a\ngiven indicator. (The \u2018reasonable range\u2019 is based on expert advice.) The user can then experiment with\nthe slider bar to examine the sensitivities of the system within a reasonable range of uncertainty. A\ntraffic light-based system of colour coding the slider bars was used to differentiate between \u201ccredible\u201d\nuncertainty (green, for \u2018go\u2019) and more \u201cextreme\u201d uncertainty (yellow, for \u2018caution\u2019), possible, but\nsomewhat outside conventional wisdom. For obvious reasons, a user is not permitted to enter the \u2018red\u2019\nzone, beyond the range of plausibility. The ability to explore uncertainty with the Simulator is\nexpected to be very useful to decision-makers, especially when considering which adaptation options\nare most viable.\nUKCIP encourages stakeholders and decision-makers to use a range of its tools to identify how they\nmight be impacted by climate change and what they can do to adapt. The Regional Impact Simulator\nis a tool to create and assess management alternatives, and it integrates two tools provided by UKCIP\nalready, the UKCIP02 climate change scenarios (Hulme et al., 2002) and the socio-economic scenarios\n(UKCIP, 2001a; Shackley and Deanwood, 2003), thus maximizing on the affect of familiarity with the\nsubject matter and, therefore, the effort invested on behalf of the user. In fact prior to the Simulator,\nstakeholders had difficulty understanding and using the socio-economic scenarios. Within the\nSimulator, however, it appears that much of the difficulty of understanding how to use socio-economic\nscenarios disappears. It is anticipated the simulator should result in greater use of socio-economic\nscenarios in decision-making and planning.\n14\nAdditionally, the different levels of analysis allowed by the Regional Impact Simulator (Figure 2-4) fit\nwell with other climate impact assessment tools provided by UKCIP. The Risk, Uncertainty and\nDecision-Making Framework (Willows and Connell, 2003) allows for analyses to be undertaken at\nvarying levels of detail. The Simulator can be used within the Risk, Uncertainty and Decision-Making\nFramework to either quickly determine major impacts they should consider, or perform a very detailed\nsensitivity analysis of the uncertainties and adaptation options.\nThe Simulator was developed to enable both \u2018top-down\u2019 and \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approaches to assessment.\nThe first two screens (see Figure 3: Pre-defined Scenario Futures and Figure 2: Exploratory Analysis)\nfulfil a prediction-oriented \u2018top-down\u2019 approach - from global scenarios to impact models. Whereas\nthe \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach which focuses on stakeholder expertise in interpreting the adaptation options\nis delivered with the third screen (see Figure 4: Influencing the Impacts).\nIn considering the use of the Regional Impact Simulator within adaptation frameworks, a broad\ndistinction can be made between its use in informing the implementation of adaptation decisions and\nin building adaptive capacity. Implementing adaptation decisions focuses on avoiding or reducing the\ncumulative impacts of climate change, ensuring that distributional impacts of adaptation are\nminimised and ensuring that adaptive measures taken by one organization or sector do not adversely\nimpact upon others (Adger et al., 2005). While the Regional Impact Simulator can inform many\ndecisions, through spatially displaying the impacts and consequences of regional adaptation responses,\ntwo key areas stand to benefit significantly from this tool. They are in:\n1. informing the integration of adaptation actions and policies across sectors, ensuring that\nadaptation resulting from actions in one sector does not reduce the effectiveness of purposeful\nadaptation in another sector. According to Adger et al., (2005), this remains a key challenge\nin achieving successful adaptation;\n2. searching for robust adaptation strategies (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2001) that are scenario-\nindependent (Dessai and Hulme, 2004) or no-regret, low-regret or win-win strategies\n(Willows and Connell, 2003) i.e.; adaptation responses which will be beneficial (or at worst\n15\nnot detrimental) for all possible future socio-economic development pathways (Lempert and\nSchlesinger, 2000).\nBuilding adaptive capacity increases the ability of individuals, groups or organizations to adapt (Adger\net a,., 2005) and includes communicating climate change information and building awareness of\npotential impacts at an appropriate regional level. Decision support tools, such as the Regional Impact\nSimulator, are tools for analysis and vehicles for communication, training, forecasting and\nexperimentation (Welp, 2001). The Regional Impact Simulator will therefore contribute to the UK\nGovernments objective of a well adapted UK by building the capacity of UK decision-makers to\nunderstand the climate and socio-economic impacts and how these might be reduced by various\nadaptation options. The Regional Impact Simulator will hopefully result in regional scale decision-\nmaking and policy formulation which takes due account of the impacts of climate change.\n5 Lessons learnt on managing stakeholder-led projects\nAn axiomatic principle of stakeholder-led research is that the research results should be useful to\nstakeholders. However, to achieve this desired outcome there are a number of challenging or\nconflicting priorities which have to be managed during the course of any such project. Who are the\nstakeholders? What do they actually want? What can realistically be delivered (within the limits of\nfunding, time and knowledge)? In climate impacts research, the cross-cutting nature of many issues\nmeans that these are potentially of interest to a range of stakeholder groups, such that their breadth of\ninterests and priorities are potentially overwhelming, if not conflicting.\nFundamental to addressing these questions and helping deliver the appropriate outputs of stakeholder-\nled research is a Steering Committee that includes stakeholder representatives. It will depend on\nindividual project (and funder) circumstances as to who is responsible for setting up the Steering\nCommittee \u2013 the research group or the funding organization(s). Individual project circumstances will\nalso determine of the range of stakeholders represented - from national to local scale organizations,\n16\ntrade bodies to conservation NGO\u2019s, government departments to agencies, etc. The 10-person Steering\nCommittee of RegIS2 was set up by the research team to have broad representation (note: an\norganization or its representatives may represent more than one category). Represented were:\nNational and regional government-\n\uf0b7 national: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs- Defra\n\uf0b7 regional: Government Office for the East of England- GO-East\nNational and regional responsibility-\n\uf0b7 national: Defra, UKCIP, UK Water Industry Research- UKWIR, English Nature\n\uf0b7 regional: GO-East, Environment Agency- Thames and North West region\nrepresentatives)\nSectors-\n\uf0b7 agriculture: Defra\n\uf0b7 water resources: Environment Agency and UKWIR\n\uf0b7 water supply: UK Water Industry Research\n\uf0b7 flood management: Environment Agency\n\uf0b7 conservation: Defra, English Nature and Environment Agency\nCommercial interests- UK Water Industry Research\nStatutory organizations- English Nature (the government agency which champions the\nconservation of wildlife, geology and wild places in England) and the Environment\nAgency (the Competent Authority under the European Water Framework Directive)\nExternal to the region: Environment Agency- Thames region representative, South East Climate\nChange Partnership and UKCIP\nPolicy focussed: Defra and Government Office for the East Of England\nTechnically focussed: all others\n17\nBased upon the experiences gained through RegIS2 and other stakeholder-led research projects, it is\nalso important to highlight several key guidelines for a Steering Committee within the research\nprocess:\n\uf0b7 Members act as filters between the researchers and the stakeholder communities, translating\ndiverse stakeholder desires into clear and consistent guidance as to the needs and priorities\nwhich the research team should aim towards;\n\uf0b7 Members contribute advice and suggestions to the debate in order to increase the likelihood\nthat research outputs are \u201cuseful\u201d to stakeholders. There are no silent members in a Steering\nCommittee. To avoid retrospective disagreements \u201csilence is taken to mean agreement\u201d.\n\uf0b7 Members contribute the experience and knowledge of their organizations to the deliberations,\nwhether this be to the science, policy frameworks, adaptation responses etc. There is a danger\nthat non-technical or non-climate change specialist stakeholders will view themselves as\nhaving nothing to contribute to a research project. ALL member have different, yet important,\ncontributions.\n\uf0b7 Priorities will vary across researchers and stakeholders and may need balancing, in particular,\nthe needs of researchers to do cutting edge, publishable, research and the needs of\nstakeholders\u2019 to have pragmatic questions answered which may not require cutting edge\nresearch. Although less problematic in projects funded by stakeholder organizations (as in\nRegIS2), this problem can be particularly acute when research is jointly funded by stakeholder\norganizations and Research Councils, as research quality is the main criterion used by the\nlatter to judge proposals, whereas utility is the main criterion of the former;\n\uf0b7 Members will share (e.g., project models, outputs, methodologies etc) with their own\norganisations and networks to road-test and validate approaches.\n\uf0b7 Representatives from organizations will be those who can inform model or methodological\ndevelopment, will use a project\u2019s outputs and can promote their use.\nThere is a final responsibility on both sides (Steering Committee and research team members) to be\nopen to, listen to and understand each other\u2019s perspectives. With all of these conditions in place, the\n18\nSteering Committee provides a win-win contribution \u2013 the Research Team is given a consistent and\nclear steer as to the direction and needs of the research, the Steering Committee members gain useful\nknowledge for their organization or sector, and the funders can demonstrate useful outputs at the end\nof the project.\n6 Lessons learnt for future participatory IA software development\nSoftware engineering texts (e.g. Pressman, 2005) describe software development as analogous to a\nwaterfall having distinct consecutive phases of problem analysis, specification, design,\nimplementation, testing and release. In the Regional Impact Simulator, not one but multiple models\nwere being developed. So, the object-oriented approach was valuable in allowing software modularity,\nand therefore the ability for different research groups to iteratively develop their models\nautonomously, yet at the same time. However it must be said that the apparent initial success of the\nRegional Impact Simulator is in no small way due to the participatory approach. The interface\ndevelopment benefited greatly from the iterative prototyping process which was informed through the\nearly identification of user needs and progressive researcher-stakeholder feedback, producing a final\ndesign that is both visually appealing and provides easy access to the necessary outputs (Dempsey and\nFisher, 2005).\nOne premise underlying the development of the Regional Impact Simulator was that such a tool\nshould be beneficial to a broad range of stakeholders. One major design issue was therefore how to\naccommodate a broad audience of end users with different needs. The solution was to provide two\nalternative interface screens, predefined scenarios and exploratory analysis, to accommodate users of\ndifferent ability to interact effectively with the modelling framework. The predefined scenarios screen\nallows users with less knowledge of the nuances of scenario construction to still run the model (for a\nlimited set of outcomes). The more advance user is able, through the exploratory analyses screen, to\nvary parameter values through on-screen sliders. Using this part of the system assumes some prior\nknowledge of how the individual sectors operate and interact, as well as some understanding of the\nlimits and credibility of alternative scenarios.\n19\nClearly this tool may be used inappropriately, either inadvertently or deliberately to demonstrate a\nbiased viewpoint, which was a significant concern of some Steering Committee members.\nInappropriate use could manifest itself in two main ways:\n\uf0b7 by setting variables unrealistically, which bear no resemblance to the underlying storyline\nbehind a scenario;\n\uf0b7 by combining, but not acknowledging, futures (scenarios) that are inconsistent with each\nother e.g. a high emissions climate scenario combined with a \u2018sustainability\u2019 socio-economic\nscenario \u2013 which erroneously suggests that the high economic activity behind the climate\nscenario is not so detrimental for the environment.\nIt is not possible to prevent inappropriate use without severely restricting the flexibility of the user to\nexplore uncertain futures, which would rather defeat the object. So the interface was designed to\nhighlight \u2018credible\u2019 ranges when setting the pressure variable of each model. In addition, when a\nsetting is changed from the default setting, the title \u201cUser Defined\u201d appears on the maps and graphs to\nindicate that the settings in use may not be consistent with the scenario selected. Alternatively, the\ntransparency of the tool (Yearley, 1999) allows potentially biased viewpoints to be challenged,\ndissuading the inappropriate use of the tool. By making the tool available in the public domain and by\nrevealing parameter settings and scenario combinations, each can then be independently verified.\n7 Future Developments\nAlthough RegIS2 was only the second regional IA project in the UK, it should not be automatically\nassumed that further research, model development etc is needed. The project evaluation (section 3.1)\ntherefore asked whether or not stakeholders felt it would be useful to develop the Regional Impact\nSimulator further. All respondents supported further development (average score of 4.3) with most\nbeing highly positive (scoring 4 or 5 out of 5). To understand the desired direction of possible future\ndevelopments, the evaluation then asked whether further development should be based on expanding\n20\nor changing the range of sectors simulated within the tool; expanding or changing the regions\nmodelled or extending the tool to provide national coverage. Although a small number of respondents\nfelt that the scope of any further development should be determined by a further consultation exercise\nand therefore did not express a preference, most respondents selected different or additional regions (5\nrespondents) and national coverage (9 respondents). For example:\n\u201c..it is imperative that further support is given to this project, to help develop the product to be\ntruly region, or nation, wide.\u201d\nTwo issues became evident from this element of the evaluation. Firstly, there is a demand for regional\nintegrated assessment. Many of the respondents were in regional or national organizations and could\nsee the benefits of such a tool for their own area. Secondly, despite a perception in favour of regional\nscale outputs, respondents felt that national coverage was also required for decision making with\nregard to climate change impacts and adaptation. This may reflect the small size of the UK and the\nimportance of national institutions such as the regulatory organizations (e.g. Environment Agency,\nEnglish Nature).\n8. Conclusions\nThis article evaluates the participatory design approach to the development of a regional integrated\nassessment tool, the Regional Impact Simulator. The Regional Impact Simulator was designed to\nallow stakeholders to explore for themselves the potential consequences of future climate and socio-\neconomic change in two regions of England. As the first such tool designed for interactive - rather\nthan assisted - stakeholder use in the UK, and perhaps Europe, both model and interface development\nwere developed iteratively \u2013 and with on-going involvement and input from the people and\norganizations intended to use it.\n21\nThe two most significant applications of the Regional Impact Simulator are likely to be 1) to inform\nthe integration of adaptation actions and policies across sectors, such that unintentional adaptation\nresulting from actions in one sector does not reduce the effectiveness of purposeful adaptation in\nanother sector, and 2) to explore robust adaptation strategies which are scenario-independent or no-\nregret strategies (i.e.; adaptation responses which will be beneficial for all future scenarios).\nA preliminary independent stakeholder evaluation of the Regional Impact Simulator, prior to releasing\nthe software to the public, indicates that users find that the software is sufficiently easy and intuitive to\nuse, the runtimes are acceptable, the outputs are useful and the Simulator merits further development.\nThe advice and guidance of the project Steering Committee have provided an invaluable contribution\nto the development of the Regional Impact Simulator, and therefore a series of Steering Committee\n\u2018rules\u2019 are proposed to help future projects gain maximum value from this valuable resource. In\nparticular, a Steering Committee is a filter between the researchers and the many diverse needs of\nstakeholder communities, in order to give clear and consistent guidance to the research team. Its\nmembers contribute the diverse experiences and knowledge of their organizations and ensure that\nresearch outputs are \u201cuseful\u201d. It has added value in that it involves people who will take such tools as\nthe Simulator into organizations to use as well as promote their use.\n9.
