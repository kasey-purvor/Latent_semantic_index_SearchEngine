These sys-\ntems are some of the most luminous galaxies at the present\nday and emit most of their radiation in the far-IR waveband,\nalthough they contribute only 0.3 per cent of the local lu-\nminosity density (Sanders & Mirabel 1996).\nMore recent work in the far-IR and submillimetre\n(submm) wavebands has produced a similar revolution in\nour view of obscured galaxies in the distant z >\u223c 1 Uni-\nverse. These observations have employed the COBE and\nISO satellites and the Submm Common-User Bolometer\nArray (SCUBA; Holland et al. 1999) on the 15-m James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope\u22c6 (JCMT). The new observations\nhave shown that the ultraluminous far-IR population evolves\nmore strongly than the equivalent optically-selected popu-\nlation and that, in contrast to the local Universe, luminous\nobscured galaxies at high redshift could contribute a sub-\nstantial fraction of the total emitted radiation.\nThis conclusion is confirmed by comparing the en-\nergy density in the optical (Bernstein et al. 2001) and\nfar-IR\/submm backgrounds (Puget et al. 1996; Fixsen et\nal. 1998; Finkbeiner, Schlegel & Davis 2000). These back-\ngrounds represent the cumulative energy emitted in these\n\u22c6 The JCMT is operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre on be-\nhalf of the United Kingdom Particle Physics and Astronomy Re-\nsearch Council (PPARC), the Netherlands Organisation for Sci-\nentific Research, and the National Research Council of Canada.\nwavebands across all epochs, mainly at redshift z \u223c 1. The\napproximate equivalence of the energy density in the two\nregimes shows that somewhere near half of the total radi-\nation in the Universe came from obscured energy sources,\nwhich could be either stars or AGN. If the majority of this\nemission is powered by radiation from stars with a stan-\ndard initial mass function (IMF), then approximately half\nof all the stars that have formed by the present day could\nhave formed in highly obscured systems. Clearly it is criti-\ncally important to include these highly-obscured sources in\nmodels of galaxy evolution if we are to obtain a complete\nunderstanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies.\nThe advent of sensitive submm imaging with SCUBA\nhas allowed a number of groups to undertake surveys for\ndistant submm galaxies. Results on the number density of\nsources in blank fields as a function of 850-\u00b5m flux density\nhave been published by three groups: Hughes et al. (1998)\nworked with a single deep map centred on the Hubble Deep\nField (HDF), while Barger et al. (1998, 1999b) employed\na combination of deep\/narrow and wide\/shallow observa-\ntions of fields in the Lockman Hole and Hawaii Survey Field\nregions; finally, there has been a survey of areas from the\nCanada-France Redshift Survey (Eales et al. 1999, 2000;\nLilly et al. 1999). Shallower, wider surveys have also been\ncarried out by Borys et al. (2001) and by the UK Submm\nSurvey consortium (Dunlop 2001; Scott et al. 2001; Fox et al.\n2001; Almaini et al. 2001). Due to the modest resolution of\nSCUBA, 15\u2032\u2032 FWHM at 850\u00b5m, the deepest of these studies\nare confusion limited at \u223c 2mJy (Hughes et al. 1998); this is\nthe deepest flux density for which reliable source detection\nis possible in blank fields (Blain, Ivison & Smail 1998; Hogg\n2001).\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 Smail et al.\nAt slightly longer wavelengths, observations using the\nMAMBO 1.2-mm camera on the IRAM 30-m telescope have\nrecently been reported in both field and lensing cluster re-\ngions (Bertoldi et al. 2000).\nRather than mapping large fields, another approach to\nconstruct large samples of submm-detected galaxies is to\nexploit the tight correlation between the far-infrared and\nradio luminosities of star-forming galaxies (Condon 1992)\nand use SCUBA to target samples of faint radio sources\n(Chapman et al. 2001b, 2001c). This innovative technique is\nparticularly well-suited for identifying the wide-field samples\nneeded to tackle issues such as the clustering strength of\nSCUBA galaxies (e.g. Almaini et al. 2001).\nOur collaboration has adopted yet another approach\nwith the aim of pushing below the confusion limit of the\nblank-field surveys. We achieve this by using massive grav-\nitational cluster lenses to increase both the sensitivity and\nresolution of SCUBA (Blain 1998). The first submm counts\nwere based on maps of two clusters (Smail, Ivison & Blain\n1997). The survey was subsequently expanded to cover seven\nlensing clusters at z = 0.19\u20130.41 (Smail et al. 1998). The\nresults of similar surveys have recently been reported by\nChapman et al. (2001) and van der Werf et al. (2001b).\nThese observations of lensing clusters benefit from a typical\namplification factor of 2\u20133\u00d7, improving both the sensitiv-\nity of the maps and their effective resolution, and so allow-\ning confusion-free counts to be derived down to \u223c 0.5mJy\n(Blain et al. 1999a), well below the conventional 2-mJy field\nconfusion limit for SCUBA. In fortuitous cases, the amplifi-\ncation can exceed 10\u00d7 (e.g. van der Werf et al. 2001b), pro-\nviding the opportunity to identify submm galaxies as faint\nas \u223c 0.1mJy and study their properties.\nBased upon this survey we have published the num-\nber counts of submm galaxies (Smail, Ivison & Blain 1997;\nBlain et al. 1999a), the identification of the counterparts\nto the submm sources in the optical (Smail et al. 1998),\nnear-infrared (Smail et al. 1999a; Frayer et al. 2000), radio\n(Smail et al. 2000) and X-ray (Fabian et al. 2000) bands,\nas well as optical spectroscopy of candidate counterparts\n(Barger et al. 1999a). We have also provided detailed multi-\nwavelength follow-up observations of the brighter sources\n(Ivison et al. 1998a, 2000a). Building on the redshifts deter-\nmined for the three brightest sources in the sample, we have\nobtained the first CO detections of submm-selected galax-\nies using the OVRO and IRAM interferometers (Frayer et\nal. 1998, 1999; Kneib et al. 2001). Yet higher-resolution CO\nimages of one source have been obtained by combining data\nfrom the OVRO and BIMA arrays (Ivison et al. 2001). High-\nresolution mm-continuum observations using the OVRO ar-\nray have also been presented (Frayer et al. 2000). Similar\nmm-continuum observations of sources in other SCUBA sur-\nveys have been presented by Downes et al. (1999), Gear et\nal. (2000) and Lutz et al. (2001). Finally, the interpretation\nof these observations and their relevance to our understand-\ning of galaxy formation and evolution at high redshifts has\nbeen discussed by Blain et al. (1999b, 1999c). This paper\nincludes a summary and update of these previous results.\nAs a benchmark for the following discussion we note\nthat an Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) with a far-\nIR luminosity of LFIR \u223c 3\u00d71012L\u2299 (similar to Arp 220), and\nthus a star-formation rate (SFR) of \u223c 300M\u2299 yr\u22121 would\nhave a 850-\u00b5m flux density of >\u223c 3mJy out to z \u223c 10 in a Uni-\nFigure 1. The flux density at 450 and 850 \u00b5m expected from\na ULIRG-like galaxy as a function of redshift for different dust\ntemperatures and cosmologies. The galaxy is assumed to have\nLFIR = 3\u00d7 10\n12 L\u2299.\nverse with q0 = 0.5.\n\u2020 The effects of different SEDs and world\nmodels on the results in the two SCUBA observing bands\nare illustrated in Fig. 1. In three 8-hr shifts of observing in\ngood conditions with SCUBA it is possible to achieve a 3\u03c3\nflux limit of 3mJy at 850\u00b5m across a 160\u2032\u2032-diameter field\n(upgrades to SCUBA now mean that this limit is reached in\ncloser to two shifts), probing a volume of 106 Mpc3 out to\nz \u223c 10 for ULIRGs.\nHere we present the source catalogue of luminous\nsubmm galaxies from our SCUBA survey, and discuss the\ncurrent identifications and properties of their counterparts\nin other wavebands. We then summarise the broad charac-\nteristics of the populations that contribute to the submm\nbackground radiation. In \u00a72 we briefly describe the submm\nobservations and their reduction and analysis. In \u00a73 we\npresent our updated estimate of the source counts at 850\nand 450\u00b5m, and in \u00a74 we describe the identification of\ncounterparts and constraints on their likely redshifts and\npower sources. A brief summary of the characteristics of\neach source is given in \u00a75, and we discuss the properties of\nthe different classes of submm galaxy in \u00a76. In \u00a77 we present\nthe main conclusions arising from the SCUBA lens survey\nand summarise these in \u00a78.\n2 SUBMM OBSERVATIONS, REDUCTION\nAND ANALYSIS\nThese data were obtained using SCUBA (Holland et al.\n1999) on the JCMT. SCUBA contains a range of detectors\nand detector arrays cooled to 0.1k covering the atmospheric\n\u2020 We assume qo = 0.5 and Ho = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 throughout\nthe paper, except in Fig. 1.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 3\nwindows from 350\u00b5m to 2000\u00b5m. In our survey, we oper-\nated the 91-element short-wave array at 450\u00b5m and the 37-\nelement long-wave array at 850\u00b5m, giving half-power beam\nwidths of 7.5\u2032\u2032 and 14.7\u2032\u2032 respectively. Operating in its con-\nventional \u2018stare\u2019 or \u2018jiggle\u2019 mode and discarding the noisy\nmap edges, the short- and long-wave arrays have effective\nfields of view of 2.3\u2032 and 2.8\u2032 respectively. The design of the\noptics ensures that a suitable jiggle pattern for the chopping\nsecondary mirror can fully sample the image plane simulta-\nneously at 450 and 850\u00b5m. The multiplexing and high effi-\nciency of the arrays means that SCUBA maps three orders\nof magnitude faster than previous submm detectors.\nThe clusters exploited in our survey are all well-studied,\nmassive systems, which exhibit strongly-lensed (i.e. high-\namplification) images of background galaxies (most with\nmeasured spectroscopic redshifts) that are employed to ac-\ncurately model the mass distribution within the cluster (see\nKneib et al. 1996; Smith et al. 2001a). These models can\nthen be used to \u2018correct\u2019 the submm observations to derive\nthe true fluxes of sources identified in our SCUBA maps\n(Blain et al. 1999a; \u00a73). The clusters and field centres for\nour observations are listed in Table 1.\nThe submm maps of the seven clusters used in our anal-\nysis were obtained from SCUBA observations on the nights\nof 1997 July 02\u201305, 1997 August 09\u201314 and 21\u201322, 1997\nSeptember 22, 1997 December 19, 1998 January 26, 29 and\n31, 1998 February 01, 1998 March 12\u201313 and 1998 April 03.\nThe typical integration time was 25\u201335 ks and the maps have\neffective noise levels of \u223c 1.7mJy rms at 850\u00b5m (Table 1).\nThe observations employed a 64-point jiggle pattern,\nfully sampling both arrays over a period of 128 s. The pat-\ntern was subdivided into nod cycles so that the target po-\nsition was be switched between the signal and reference po-\nsitions (separated by 60\u2032\u2032 in azimuth) in a repeating signal\u2013\nreference\u2013reference\u2013signal scheme, with sixteen 1-s jiggles in\neach position. As well as tracing out the jiggle pattern, the\nsecondary was chopped at \u22437Hz, also by 60\u2032\u2032 in azimuth.\nA side effect of this complex procedure is the creation of\ntwo negative images of any source in the field, each \u22121\/2\u00d7\nthe intensity of the source and separated from the source\nin azimuth by 60\u2032\u2032. Since SCUBA has no image rotator, the\npositions of these negative sources migrate slowly around\nthe source during each integration. Azimuthal chopping has\nadvantages; sky removal is optimised and the field rotation\nmeans that additional real sources are less likely to be consis-\ntently nullified, however it carries a penalty: unlike nodding\nand chopping in R.A.\/Dec. coordinates (the mode now used\nas standard; see Ivison et al. 2000b), information contained\nin the negative images of each source is difficult to recover.\nMoreover, the noise levels we quote inevitably include a con-\ntribution from the negative images of real, bright sources as\nwell as from faint sources below our detection threshold (i.e.\nconventional confusion noise).\nThe pointing stability was checked every hour and reg-\nular skydips were performed to measure the atmospheric\nopacity, which averaged 0.2 at 850\u00b5m and 1.0 at 450\u00b5m,\nand was as good as 0.09 and 0.4 on respectively on occa-\nsion. The rms pointing errors were typically 2\u2032\u2032 (see \u00a74.3).\nThe dedicated SCUBA data reduction software (surf,\nJenness 1997) was used to reduce the observations. The re-\nduction consisted of subtracting the reference from the sig-\nnal on a second-by-second basis, giving 1280 data points per\nbolometer per 20-integration scan, where an integration rep-\nresents the time needed to complete a full jiggle pattern (64 s\nin both the reference and signal positions). The data were\nflatfielded and corrected for atmospheric attenuation, then\ninspected statistically and visually. Some were rejected on\nthe basis of large deviations from a bolometer\u2019s mean, some\nothers on the basis of noticably peculiar behaviour. Data\nfrom bolometers suffering excessively from 1\/f noise were\nalso flagged as bad and removed from the analysis. At this\nstage, median values evaluated across the whole array were\nused to compensate for the spatially-correlated sky emis-\nsion, reducing the effective noise-equivalent flux density to\n75\u201390mJyHz\u22121\/2 at 850\u00b5m (see Ivison et al. 1998b).\nThe sky position appropriate for each data point is\nknown, based on the flatfield (a file containing the relative\nbolometer sensitivities and positions) and the jiggle pattern,\nso maps can be generated by placing data from each bolome-\nter on to an astrometric grid of 2\u2032\u2032 and 4\u2032\u2032 pixels at 450\nand 850\u00b5m respectively (approximately Nyquist sampling).\nData values more than 4\u03c3 from each pixel\u2019s mean were re-\njected and pixels closer than 14\u2032\u2032 (one beamwidth) to the\nmost extreme jiggle positions (regions with low effective ex-\nposure times) were blanked out from the map.\nThe resulting images were calibrated using nightly\nbeam maps of Uranus, Mars and occasionally CRL618. Ab-\nsolute flux calibration is accurate to 10 and 20 per cent\nat 850 and 450\u00b5m, values fixed in part by the 5-per-cent\nuncertainty in the brightness temperature of Mars. Several\ncalibration methods were employed and used in the appro-\npriate circumstances: the conventional \u2018Jy beam\u22121\u2019 method\nwas used primarily to calculate the noise in each map; an\n\u2018aperture photometry\u2019 method, with a variety of apertures,\nwas used to measure source flux densities in map regions not\naffected significantly by confusion. The maps are presented\nin Fig. 2.\nSource catalogues from our fields were constructed us-\ning the Sextractor package (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The\ndetection algorithm requires that the surface brightness in\nfour contiguous pixels (or 64 sq. arcsec) exceeds a threshold\nafter subtracting a smooth background signal and convolv-\ning the map with a 16\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 16\u2032\u2032 top-hat filter. The detection\nthreshold used was 1\u03c3 of the map noise (Table 1), which\nincludes both contributions from sources and their negative\nreference beams. The \u2018true\u2019 map noise is typically 20\u201330 per\ncent lower than the values listed in Table 1.\nOur observations were obtained early in SCUBA\u2019s op-\neration and we adopted a conservative azimuthal chop, since\nit was then unclear whether differential spillover of the beam\nsidelobes onto the ground could lead to systematic errors or\nincreased noise for R.A.\/Dec.-chopped observations. This is\nnow known not to be a significant effect. The smearing of\nthe negative images of sources in the final map, when us-\ning azimuthal chopping, reduces their usefulness for clean-\ntype analyses (Hughes et al. 1998; Ivison et al. 2000b) and\nour source detection therefore does not use any information\nfrom the negative images of sources. Once detected, how-\never, the sources were checked visually: all of the brightest\nsources have negative counterparts at the expected positions\n(e.g. for the A370 map in Fig. 2 these lie 60\u2032\u2032 to the north-\nwest\/south-east of each source). The number of independent\nresolution elements in our survey is about 760, and so no 4-\u03c3\nnoise peaks are expected in the catalogue. As a check, we\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 Smail et al.\nFigure 2. 850-\u00b5m maps of the seven cluster fields from the SCUBA Lens Survey.

We were also able to recover all of the\nsources from independent sub-samples of the data.\nAs we have not \u2018cleaned\u2019 the maps, there is an additional\nsource of confusion for faint sources in those maps which\ncontain at least one bright source: the reference beams from\nbright sources could be chopped onto another source, result-\ning in deviations in its apparent position and flux density.\nHowever, the only clear case of this is for SMMJ14010+0252\n(the central galaxy in A 1835), where the chopped images of\ntwo bright sources overlap near the central galaxy, both re-\nducing its flux density and confusing its position (Ivison et\nal. 2000a).\nWith the lensing amplification taken into account, the\ndata shown in Fig. 2 are some of the deepest sub-mm maps\nso far published. In regions close to critical lines in the image\nplane the maps are sensitive to galaxies with intrinsic flux\ndensities as faint as 0.2mJy, if these have a surface density\ngreat enough to populate the relevant regions of the source\nplane.\nA total of 17 sources are detected above the nominal\n3-\u03c3 limits, and 10 above the 4-\u03c3 limits, of the 850-\u00b5m maps\n(which correspond to \u223c 4- and \u223c 5-\u03c3 when using noise es-\ntimates from cleaner regions of the maps). We list these in\norder of their fluxes in Table 2. These are detected in a total\nsurveyed area of \u2243 40 arcmin2 in the image plane (Fig. 3).\nNone of the sources are resolved at 850\u00b5m (c.f. Ivison et\nal. 2001a). Five of these sources are also detected at 450\u00b5m\n(Table 2). From the surface density of sources detected in a\ntypical field, we can be confident that our observations are\nnot limited by confusion: there are \u223c 45 beams per source\n(Blain, Ivison & Smail 1998; Hogg 2001).\nThe atmospheric transparency at 450\u00b5m on Mauna\nKea is lower than at 850\u00b5m even in good weather, and to-\ngether with the reduced aperture efficiency this explains the\nsmaller number of sources detected in our 450-\u00b5m maps (Ta-\nble 2). The flux density limits for detection in the 450-\u00b5m\nmaps are listed in Table 1.\n3 SUB-MM SOURCE COUNTS AND THE\nEXTRAGALACTIC BACKGROUND\nOur complete 850-\u00b5m sample comprises a total of 17 galax-\nies, two of which are identified with the central cluster galax-\nies (cDs) in the clusters A 1835 and A 2390. Edge et al.\n(1999) provide more discussion of the cDs; we list their prop-\nerties in Tables 2, 4 and 5 for completeness, but exclude\nthem from our subsequent analysis. Initially, a further two\nsubmm sources were associated with galaxies in the fore-\nground of the lensing clusters (Smail et al. 1998); however,\nadditional data has provided more plausible counterparts in\nthe background (\u00a75). Thus all 15 of the non-cD detections\nappear to be background galaxies.\nThe analysis of these 15 sources makes use of well-\nconstrained lens models for all the clusters to accurately cor-\nrect the observed source fluxes for lens amplification. We use\nthe same approach as that employed by Blain et al. (1999a),\nbut include SMMJ04431+0210 and SMMJ09429+4658 in\nthe analysis, based upon the subsequent identifications of\ntheir counterparts as background galaxies. We briefly de-\nFigure 3. The total area surveyed in the source plane across all\nseven clusters in our sample as a function of lens amplification and\namplification-corrected 850-\u00b5m flux density. The latter assumes a\ntypical value of the effective noise in our maps of 1.7mJy rms. The\ncluster lenses provide an increasing sensitivity across a decreasing\narea of the background plane. The effect is mildly dependent on\nthe source redshift. Details of the magnified area for each cluster\ncan be found in Fig. 1 of Blain et al. (1999a).\nscribe the method below. The interested reader should refer\nto Blain et al. (1999a) for more details and references for\nthe lens models employed for specific clusters.\nIn each cluster we use the appropriate lenstool mod-\nels (Kneib et al. 1996), to map the detected sources from\ntheir observed positions back onto the source plane assum-\ning source redshifts of zs = 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 (this correction\nvaries only slightly for sources at zs >\u223c 1 and so we have\nadopted the zs = 3 case, in line with the results discussed\nin \u00a74.6). The observed flux densities are also corrected for\nlens amplification, leading to true flux densities in the source\nplane that are less than the observed values. Note that the\namplifications quoted in Table 4 are calculated using the\nredshift constraints listed in that table, while the calculation\nhere assumes a median redshift for the sample as a whole.\nNone of the SCUBA sources appear to be multiple images\n(van der Werf et al. 2001b) of the same galaxy (although see\nSMMJ00266+1710 in \u00a75) and so we count them individually.\nThe number counts, Nraw(> S, z), are calculated by simply\nsumming the number of sources brighter than a flux density\nS in the source plane, after correcting for lensing. A simple\napproximation to the Poisson uncertainty 1.1\n\u221a\nNraw \u2212 1 is\nattached to this value for Nraw \u2265 4; for Nraw < 3, results\nfrom Gerhels (1986) are used. Poisson noise due to the mod-\nest sample size dominates both calibration uncertainties and\nuncertainties in the lensing correction.\nNext we estimate the area surveyed by our observations.\nThe area of background sky within which a galaxy would be\ndetectable above a given flux limit in each cluster was deter-\nmined from a map of the amplification in the source plane,\nderived using the lenstool models. Based on this, the area\nof the source plane behind each cluster that lies within the\nSCUBA field of view, and is amplified by a factor greater\nthan \u00b5, A> is shown in Fig. 3. Due to the amplification,\nA> is smaller than the SCUBA field of view.

We have verified that this is case by assuming dif-\nferent source redshifts between z = 1.5 and 4, as shown in\nFig. 3.\nTo calculate the effective area of our survey to a given\nsensitivity limit we use the fact that a galaxy with a flux\ndensity S in the source plane will appear in the image\nplane of a particular cluster above a detection threshold\nSmin if it is amplified by a factor greater than \u00b5 = Smin\/S.\nThe area in the source plane within which such a galaxy\nwould be detected in that cluster is then A>(Smin\/S, z).\nThe flux density threshold Smin and the form of A> are\ndifferent for each cluster. By dividing the number of de-\ntected galaxies in the catalogue Nraw by the sum of the\nareas A>(Smin\/S, z) for all seven clusters, the count N(>\nS, z) \u2243 Nraw(> S, z)\/\n\u2211\nA>(Smin\/S, z) is derived.\nThe final 850-\u00b5m counts are shown in Table 3 and\nFig. 4. These are within the 1-\u03c3 errors of our previous anal-\nysis of the 850-\u00b5m counts (Blain et al. 1999a). The results\nare thus insensitive to the precise identification of individual\nsubmm sources in our survey.\nThe effects of uncertainties in the redshift distribution\nof the sources for the lensing reconstruction, and hence for\nthe final counts, were quantified by adopting different as-\nsumed source redshifts, as illustrated in Fig. 2 of Blain et\nal. (1999a). The uncertainty is less than about 10 per cent,\nand is dominated by the Poisson noise. An appropriate sys-\ntematic uncertainty term is included in the counts listed\nin Table 3 and shown in Fig. 4. The robustness of our am-\nplification correction was verified by extensive Monte-Carlo\nsimulations (see Blain et al. 1999a). We include the uncer-\ntainties associated with our lensing analysis in the final error\nquoted on the counts listed in Table 3. The total uncertainty\nin the lensing correction is at most comparable to the typical\n10-per-cent error in the absolute flux calibration.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 7\nWe have applied the same methods to the catalogue\nconstructed from the 450-\u00b5m maps of the seven lensing clus-\nters observed in the survey (Blain et al. 2000). The 450-\u00b5m\ncounts that result from the analysis are listed in Table 3 and\nFig. 4.\nThe 15 sources detected at 850\u00b5m in this survey suffer\na range of lens amplifications, 1.5\u2013>\u223c 4 (Table 4). For the\nmedian source amplification of \u223c 2.5 (Fig. 3) our survey\ncovers an area in the source plane equivalent to \u223c 15 arcmin2\nto a 3-\u03c3 flux density limit of about 2mJy at 850\u00b5m. At\nhigher amplifications, the survey covers a smaller region at\na correspondingly higher sensitivity, in particular regions of\nvery high amplification lie within our survey areas along\ncritical lines. As a result, we are able to constrain the general\nform of the integral counts at even fainter limits, down to\n<\u223c 0.5mJy, because we know the area in the source plane over\nwhich such faint sources could be detected, and the number\nof sources brighter than this limit that were detected.\nThe absolute limit to the depth of the survey can be\ndetermined from Fig. 3, which shows that a significant area\nbehind the cluster lenses is surveyed down to the 0.25mJy 3-\n\u03c3 flux density level \u2013 approximately 0.7 arcmin2, or about 10\nobserving beams on the sky. Note that the lens amplification\nin the cluster fields also results in an effective beam size that\nis about half the size of the apparent beam, enabling a fainter\nconfusion limit to be reached as compared with blank-field\nobservations (see \u00a73.1 and Fig. 5). However, fainter than\nabout 0.25mJy the effects of source confusion, and the un-\ncertainty in the area of the high-magnification region shown\nin Fig. 3 are likely to become significant, and so we plot the\nderived counts from the direct inversion technique as an up-\nper limit at 0.25mJy. This limit is consistent with the lack\nof any clear candidates for multiply-imaged submm sources\namongst the sources with typical fluxes of 4\u20135mJy in the\ncatalogue. The magnification of such multiply-imaged sys-\ntems is expected to be in excess of 10, and so it is reasonable\nto quote only an upper limit at a flux density of 0.25mJy,\nwhich is a factor of 20 deeper than the faintest source. We\nnote, however, that this constraint may be strengthened by\nfuture submm surveys of clusters lenses. In particular, van\nder Werf et al. (2001b) have recently detected a multiply-\nimaged, and thus highly amplified, submm source in A 2218.\nWhile both the results of the direct inversion technique\nand the Monte Carlo method are of course uncertain, due\nto the unknown redshifts of a fraction of the sources \u2013 they\ngive consistent results at flux densities fainter than 1mJy\n(Fig. 4). Both techniques suggest that at least one, and\nprobably several, of the four sources with lower limits on\ntheir amplifications actually arises from the 0.5\u20131mJy pop-\nulation. Correlation of fainter features in the submm maps\nwith multi-waveband data in the radio, X-ray and mid-IR,\ncan be used to identify examples of the sub-mJy submm\npopulation (Ivison et al. 2000a; Fabian et al. 2000).\nOur Monte Carlo method (Blain et al. 1999a) yields\na count of the form N(> S) = K(S\/S0)\n\u03b1 as a function\nof flux density S.

Note that this procedure simply involves adding\nthe detected flux densities of the non-cluster galaxies in our\nsurvey. Gravitational lensing does not modify surface bright-\nness, and so there is no need for any amplification correction.\nThe uncertainties in this procedure are entirely due to the\nlimited size of the sample, the calibration uncertainties in\nthe SCUBA images and cosmic variance. Compared to the\ntotal intensity of extragalactic background radiation at these\ntwo wavelengths, measured using COBE-FIRAS (Fixsen et\nal. 1998), we resolve about 60 and 15 per cent of the 850-\nand 450-\u00b5m backgrounds down to flux densities of 1mJy\nand 10mJy respectively (see Fig. 4). Unless the counts flat-\nten rapidly below 1mJy, the bulk of the 850-\u00b5m background\nwill be resolved at flux limits of 0.1\u20130.5mJy (Hughes et al.\n1998).\nA typical galaxy in our sample has an intrinsic 850-\u00b5m\nflux density of 3\u20134mJy after correcting for lensing (see Ta-\nble 4). From Fig. 1, it is clear that if these galaxies lie at\nz >\u223c 1, and provided that their temperatures are not sub-\nstantially less than 40k, then all are ULIRGs, with far-IR\nluminosities LFIR >\u223c 10\n12\u20131013 L\u2299. There is no evidence that\neither of these conditions is breached for any of our submm-\nselected galaxies. Even in low-redshift low-luminosity IRAS\ngalaxies for which submm data is available (Dunne et al.\n2000; Lisenfeld, Isaak & Hills 2000), the mean temperature\nis 36K (but see Dunne & Eales 2001), and there is a general\ntrend for more luminous objects to have higher dust temper-\natures. Thus we can conclude that at least half of the submm\nbackground is produced by ULIRGs (LFIR \u2265 1012 L\u2299, equiv-\nalent to flux densities \u2265 1mJy), with the bulk of the re-\nmainder coming from LIRGs (Sanders & Mirabel 1996;\nLFIR \u2265 1011 L\u2299). Hence, most of the submm background\nis produced by galaxies with a relatively narrow range of lu-\nminosities, in contrast with the very wide luminosity range\ncontributing to the optical and near-IR backgrounds.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 Smail et al.\nFigure 4.

The top panel compares the cumulative flux in the resolved population from a direct integration of our\ncounts to that estimated by COBE. Right: the equivalent 450-\u00b5m counts of galaxies. The direct and Monte Carlo counts derived here\nare shown by the solid points and dotted lines respectively. The dashed line gives the parametric fit to the counts quoted in the text.\nAgain the top panel shows the flux of the resolved population compared to the estimate of the total background given by COBE.\n3.1 Confusion in SCUBA surveys\nUnresolved and undetected faint sources in the large SCUBA\nbeam generate an additional source of noise in survey maps.\nEstimates of the magnitude of this effect were presented by\nBlain et al. (1998), based on the results obtained early in the\nSCUBA Lens Survey. The noise properties of the SCUBA\nmap of the HDF (Hughes et al. 1998) clearly shows a non-\nGaussian tail characteristic of this effect, illustrated in their\nFig. 5.\nHere we simulate confusion for SCUBA by drawing a\nlarge number of simulated background galaxy distributions\nfrom the counts shown in Fig. 4. We then simulate the ob-\nservation of these fields using the standard \u22120.5\/+1\/\u22120.5\nSCUBA chopping scheme and resolution. The distribution\nof measured values in the absence of additional instrumental\nand sky noise is shown in Fig. 5a, while the effects of adding\nadditional Gaussian noise with a variance of 1.7mJy, char-\nacteristic of the effective noise level in the Lens Survey, is\nshown in Fig. 5b. The smooth Gaussian profile superimposed\non Fig. 5a has the same width as the estimate of confusion\nnoise (0.44mJy) presented by Blain et al. (1998). In Fig. 5b\nthe smooth profile represents a Gaussian of width 1.7mJy,\ndescribing the non-confusion noise. Note that the distribu-\ntion of flux densities shown should apply to every point in\nthe sky, both those containing detected sources and those\nwithout.\nThe non-Gaussian properties of the confusion signal are\nclearly visible in Fig. 5a. The core of the distribution is well\ndescribed by a Gaussian, but there is a long high-flux tail\nthat is not acccounted for by this distribution. The distribu-\ntion is also noticeably asymmetric, although the asymmetry\nis reduced by the three-position chopping scheme. A log-\nnormal distribution can provide a good description of the\nhigh-flux tail; however, it is clear from the distribution of\nsimulated measurements that confusion is unlikely to be se-\nvere at flux densities greater than 2mJy. In Fig. 5b, the\nadditional noise sources swamps the confusion signal, and\nthe noise properties are almost Gaussian.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 9\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5. Simulated levels of source confusion in SCUBA map-\nping observations. In (a), the asymmetric confusion noise distri-\nbution in chopped observations in the absence of instrumental or\nsky noise are shown by the histogram. The smooth curve has a\nwidth corresponding to the estimate of confusion noise in Blain et\nal. (1998). There is an additional non-Gaussian tail to the distri-\nbution. In (b), the results of similar simulations are shown, with\nan additional 1.7-mJy Gaussian noise source added, typical of the\ndepth of the SCUBA Lens Survey observations. The effect of con-\nfusion is very small, as the solid curve representing the additional\nsky and instrument noise is very similar to the histogram.\nRecently, Hogg (2001) simulated the effects of confu-\nsion for reliable determination of source positions and fluxes\nin 850-\u00b5m SCUBA surveys, arguing that for reliable detec-\ntions, a limit of about 2mJy is required for a count with\nN(> S) \u221d S\u22121.5, in agreement with the result above. In\ncontrast, Eales et al. (2000) have argued that confusion bi-\nases the positions and especially the fluxes of sources at\nbrighter levels, >\u223c 3\u20134mJy. The simulations of Eales et al.\n(2000) appear to assume a very steep integral count slope\nof N(> S) \u221d S\u22122.6, based on their Fig. 3, than found here.\nThis count is significantly steeper than the envelope of all\nthe current counts shown in Fig. 3. Because the effects of\nconfusion are more severe for steeper counts (see Figs 2,3 &\n4 in Hogg 2001), this assumption of Eales et al. \u2019s simula-\ntions is likely to account for the difference with our results.\nThe estimates of the positional uncertainty of sources due\nto confusion, from both the Eales et al. and Hogg simula-\ntions, confirm that sources can easily move by at least half\nthe beamwidth due to shifts in image centroids imposed by\nunderlying confusing sources.\nBased on the counts shown in Fig. 3, at the 3\u20134mJy\ndepths involved in the SCUBA Lens Survey, and the CFRS\nsurvey, confusion is unlikely to be significant compared with\ninstrument and sky noise, unless the data are smoothed.\nThe typical effect of confusion at these flux densities is to\ndisperse measured source flux densities by of order 0.5mJy,\nslightly increasing the number of formal detections at the\nfaintest levels. Neither of these effects would significantly\nmodify our results, and would certainly not lead to a uni-\nform boosting of the flux density of all the detections by\n40 per cent as claimed by Eales et al. (2000). No systematic\nboost of the flux density of sources at all observed fluxes was\nfound here or in the results shown in Fig. 3 of Hogg (2001).\nHowever, for very steep counts, which may well occur at flux\ndensities in excess of 20mJy, then significant flux boosting of\nthis kind can certainly occur. The effects of confusion in the\nexisting SCUBA surveys should be easy to quantify when\naccurate flux densities and positions for SCUBA sources are\ndetermined using submillimeter interferometers such as the\nforthcoming Submillimeter Array (SMA; Ho et al. 2000).\n4 IDENTIFYING COUNTERPARTS TO\nSUBMM SOURCES\nHaving resolved the majority of the 850-\u00b5m background we\ncan now move on to attempt to study the nature of the\npopulations contributing to it and so determine at what\nepoch the background was emitted. Here again our survey\nhas the advantage of lens amplification, this time in the ra-\ndio and optical\/near-IR where the identification and spec-\ntroscopic follow-up are undertaken. Typically the counter-\nparts of our submm sources will appear \u223c 1mag. brighter\nthan the equivalent galaxy in a blank field, providing a gain\nequivalent to moving from a 10-m to a 16-m telescope.\nHowever, the low spatial resolution of SCUBA on the\nJCMT, 15\u2032\u2032 at 850\u00b5m, combined with the faintness of the\ncounterparts to the submm sources in most other wave-\nbands, can make identification of counterparts on the basis\nof positional coincidence difficult. The absolute astrometry\nof the submm maps is not an issue with these comparisons \u2013\nit has been confirmed for several of the brighter sources us-\ning mm-wave interferometry (Frayer et al. 1998, 1999, 2000;\nIvison et al. 2001b; Kneib et al. 2002; \u00a74.3; see also Downes\net al. 1999; Gear et al. 2000; Bertoldi et al. 2000; Lutz et al.\n2001). These observations confirm that the typical random\nastrometric errors for bright submm sources is <\u223c 2\u20133\n\u2032\u2032, this\nis expected to degrade to \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 for the faintest sources in\nour sample (see Hogg 2001).\nIn the remainder of this section we chart the chrono-\nlogical development of our source identification process to\nillustrate how it has evolved over the lifetime of the project.\n4.1 Optical counterparts\nAlthough the submm galaxies are expected to be very dusty,\nit is not foregone conclusion that they will be either very red\nor optically faint \u2013 the restframe UV colours of local ULIRGs\nspan a wide range and include examples of relatively blue\ngalaxies (Trentham et al. 1999; Fig 8). We therefore began\nour search for counterparts of the submm sources in our\nsurvey in the optical waveband.\nOne of the key features used in selecting the SCUBA\nsurvey clusters for this study was that they were well stud-\nied, and in particular that deep, high-quality archival optical\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 Smail et al.\nimaging existed for each of the fields, including Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST ) WFPC2 imaging.\nDetails of the optical observations, their reduction and\nanalysis can be found in Smail et al. (1998). More detailed\ndiscussion of the optical observations of specific fields is\ngiven by Ivison et al. (1998a) and Soucail et al. (1999) for\nA370 by Ivison et al. (2000a, 2001b) for A1835 and by Smail\net al. (1999a) for the MS 0440+02 and Cl 0939+47 fields.\nAll the frames are calibrated to provide standard\nCousins I-band photometry and are linked astrometrically\nto the APM coordinate system with a typical accuracy of\n<\u223c 0.5\n\u2032\u2032. Colours are measured using 2\u2032\u2032-diameter apertures\nfrom the seeing matched I- and K-band frames (Table 4).\nWhen total I-band magnitudes are quoted these refer to\n4\u2032\u2032-diameter aperture photometry corrected for light falling\noutside the aperture assuming a point source profile.\nWe show in Fig. 6 the submm maps of each of the\n15 cluster background sources overlayed on the deep I-\nband exposures of these frames. For the sources in A 2390,\nCl 2244\u221202 and most of those in Cl 0024+16, we use HST\nF814W (I) images degraded to the same seeing and pixel\nscale as ground-based near-IR images (see \u00a74.2). For the\nremaining fields we have used deep, ground-based I-band\nframes: for Cl 0939+47 and MS 0440+02 we use the Keck I-\nband imaging from Smail et al. (1999a) and for A1835 and\nA370 the Hale 5-m and CFHT imaging discussed in Smail\net al. (1998).\nHowever, in the course of this analysis it has become\nclear that identifying submm counterparts using optical data\nalone is a problematic process (Smail et al. 1998; Lilly et\nal. 1999). With the exception of a handful of three unusual\nand optically-bright counterparts: SMMJ02399\u22120136 (Ivi-\nson et al. 1998); SMMJ02399\u22120134 (Soucail et al. 1999) and\nSMMJ14011+0252 (Ivison et al. 2000a), the majority of the\nsubmm sources cannot be reliable identified on the basis of\njust optical imaging, irrespective of its depth (\u00a74.6; Smail et\nal. 2000).\n4.2 Near-infrared counterparts\nTo more reliably identify counterparts to the 15 submm\nsources we next obtained near-IR imaging of our fields. The\ngoal is to combine this with the deep optical data, to at-\ntempt to locate any counterparts within the submm error\nbox on the basis of their unusual optical\u2013near-IR colours,\ne.g. (I \u2212 K) >\u223c 5. For this purpose the depth required in\nthe K-band was set by the depth of the available I-band\nimages, I \u223c 25\u201326, with the deepest being the multi-orbit\nHST exposures, leading to a limit of K \u223c 20\u201321 for our\nobservations. In most cases, integrating fainter in K might\nproduce additional candidate counterparts but we would be\nunable to identify these as unusual on the basis of their very\nred colours from our existing optical images. In the few cases\nwhere more accurate positional information about a proba-\nble submm source is available, from either mm-wave contin-\nuum or radio interferometry maps, deeper K-band observa-\ntions have been obtained (e.g. Ivison et al. 2000a; Frayer et\nal. 2000).\nThe near-IR observations of our fields were undertaken\nin typically good conditions during several observing runs\nin late 1998 and early 1999 using the IRCAM3 and UFTI\ncameras on the 3.8-m UKIRT\u2021. Observations consist of deep\nK-band exposures (with J- or H-band observations of the\nbrighter sources detected in K).\nData were obtained with IRCAM3 on the nights of 1998\nJuly 11\u201316 and 18, September 10 and 19, October 9 and\n1999 February 8\u201312. The new UFTI camera, which pro-\nvides finer sampling of the average seeing on UKIRT, was\nused on 1998 October 18\u201319 and November 19. The see-\ning during these nights was typically 0.4\u20130.8\u2032\u2032 . Data taken\nin non-photometric conditions (1998 July 16, September 19\nand October 18\u201319) were calibrated using independent ex-\nposures taken on photometric nights. Total exposure times\nfor the individual fields are listed in Table 4.\nObservations of the MS 0440+02 and Cl 0939+47 fields\nare discussed in Smail et al. (1999a), while Ivison et al.\n(1998a, 2000a) discuss the A 370 and A1835 fields, respec-\ntively. Frayer et al. (2000) present very deep near-IR ob-\nservations of SMMJ00266+1708. Here we describe the re-\nsults for the complete sample. We note that a programme\nof deeper near-IR imaging and spectroscopy, targeting the\nbrightest submm sources, is currently underway on Keck to\nattempt to identify faint near-IR counterparts in some of\nthe blank or ambigious fields (see Frayer et al. 2000 for the\nfirst results).\nThe UKIRT observations used repeated sequences of\nnine exposures dithered on a 3 \u00d7 3 grid with a 10\u2032\u2032 sep-\naration to allow the science images to be flatfielded using\na running median sky frame constructed from the adja-\ncent science frames. The frames were linearised, dark sub-\ntracted, flatfielded and combined in a standard manner. The\nfinal stacked frames were photometrically calibrated using\nUKIRT Faint Standards (Casali & Hawarden 1992). The as-\ntrometry on these frames comes from comparison with the\nI-band exposures of these fields.\nWe show in Fig. 6 K-band images of the fields of the\nsources and compare these to the I-band images to illustrate\nthe colours of possible counterparts. In combination with the\ndeep optical data, it is simple to pick out several unusually\nred galaxies, which are bright in theK-band and faint or un-\ndetected in the I-band. Of these, amongst the most striking\nare the extremely red objects (EROs, e.g. Smith et al. 2001b)\nin the fields of SMMJ09429+4658 and SMMJ04431+0210\n(\u00a75). The low surface density of such very red galaxies in\nblank fields, combined with the possible connection between\ntheir extreme colours and the presence of dust, both ar-\ngue for these galaxies being the correct counterparts to the\nsubmm sources (see Smail et al. 1999a).\nFrom the near-IR imaging of our complete submm sam-\nple, which reaches a median 2\u03c3 depth of K \u223c 21 (K \u223c 22 in\nthe source plane), we identify counterparts to about half of\nthe submm sources in the sample, of these around half again\nare also visible in the optical. Table 4 lists photometry for\nthe various counterparts and we discuss these further in \u00a75.\nIn Table 4, a non-detection corresponds to the 2\u03c3 limit on\nthe total magnitude of a point source.\n\u2021 UKIRT is operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre on behalf\nof the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council of the\nUnited Kingdom.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 11\n4.3 Radio counterparts\nDeep radio maps provide the most powerful complement to\nour submm observations. This is particularly true of observa-\ntions at 1.4GHz from the NRAO Very Large Array\u00a7 (VLA).\nThe resulting maps are sensitive to star-forming galaxies out\nto high redshifts (e.g. Richards 1999; Smail et al. 1999b),\nhave a spatial resolution that is well matched to the expected\nsize of distant galaxies, and high astrometric precision; they\nthus provide the best opportunity to unambigiously iden-\ntify the counterparts of submm sources (Ivison et al. 1998a,\n2000a, 2001b).\nThe deep 1.4-GHz maps used by Smail et al. (2000) to\nidentify radio counterparts for the submm sources in our\nsample were all obtained with the VLA in A and\/or B con-\nfiguration, giving effective resolutions of 1\u20135\u2032\u2032. In A config-\nuration, most of the detected galaxies are resolved, some\nmore than others: for SMMJ02399\u22120136 at z = 2.80 the\ntwo interacting\/merging components, L1 and L2, are re-\nsolved from each other, and resolved individually (Ivison et\nal. 1999; Owen et al., in prep). While for SMMJ14011+0252\nthe combined A+B configuration map constructed by Ivi-\nson et al. (2001b) resolves the starburst region and shows\nthat it is distinct from the optically-luminous components of\nthis system. In contrast the B configuration maps may pro-\nvide a more reliable measure of the total radio flux in these\nextended systems, and hence a better comparison to large-\naperture submm fluxes. We list the total exposure times and\n1-\u03c3 sensitivity limits of the maps in Table 1. The typical 3-\n\u03c3 sensitivity of these deep maps on the background source\nplane is about 18\u00b5Jy, and so the sensitivity is sufficient to\ndetect a ULIRG at a redshift z \u2243 3 (Downes et al. 1999).\nA summary of these observations is given by Smail et\nal. (2000). More details of the reduction and analysis of\nindividual maps can be found in the following references:\nfor Cl 0024+16 in Morrison (1999); for A 370 in Ivison et\nal. (1998a); for MS 0440+02 in Smail et al. (1999a); for\nCl 0939+47 in Smail et al. (1999a, 1999b); for A 1835 in\nIvison et al. (2000a, 2001b); and for A 2390 in Edge et al.\n(1999). Note that the bright radio source associated with\nthe central cluster galaxy in A2390 reduces the sensitivity\nof the map of this field.\nSmail et al. (2000) searched for radio counterparts\nwithin the nominal error boxes of the submm sources. In\nambigious cases where the nominal error box is blank in the\nradio, but a radio source is visible just outside, they adopted\nthe conservative approach of using the flux of that source as\na limit on the radio counterpart. When using the radio and\nsubmm fluxes to place limits on the possible redshifts of the\nsources, this approach leads to a firm lower redshift estimate\nfor the submm source (see \u00a74.6).\nUsing the radio maps, Smail et al. (2000) found coun-\nterparts to roughly half the sample (Table 4). Several of\nthese correspond to previously identified counterparts from\nthe optical or near-IR identification campaigns. However, a\nnumber were new identifications and these prompted fur-\nther, deeper near-IR observations using the improved posi-\n\u00a7 The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the\nNational Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agree-\nment by Associated Universities, Inc.\ntions from the radio maps to attempt to detect counterparts\n(e.g. SMMJ14009+0252, Ivison et al. 2000a).\nWe list the apparent radio fluxes or 3\u03c3 limits in Ta-\nble 5. For the 10 submm sources with radio counterparts,\nwe measure a median positional offset of only 2.0\u2032\u2032 between\nthe submm and radio positions. This supports the estimates\nof the positional accuracy of the submm sources, < 2\u20134\u2032\u2032,\nquoted in \u00a72 and used in the searches for optical and near-IR\ncounterparts (Smail et al. 1998; \u00a74). We note that the good\npositional accuracy of our submm sources confirms that con-\nfusion is not a significant concern for our survey (c.f. Eales\net al. 2000).\n4.4 Mid-IR properties\nSeveral of the cluster lens targeted by our SCUBA survey\nhave also been imaged in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) using\nISOCAM. Maps of A 370 and A2390 at 15\u00b5m are discussed\nby Altieri et al. (1999) and Metcalfe et al. (1999), while\nsimilar observations have been obtained for Cl 0024+16 and\nCl 2244\u221202 (L. Metcalfe, priv. comm.). In total there are\nfive submm sources in A 370 and A 2390, and if we dis-\ncount the central galaxy in A 2390 (which is detected by\nISO, Edge et al. 1999), we find that three of the remaining\nfour submm sources are detected in the ISO 15-\u00b5m maps:\nSMMJ02399\u22120136 (Ivison et al. 1998a), SMMJ02399\u22120134\n(Soucail et al. 1999) and SMMJ21536+1742, at apparent\nflux limits of \u223c 0.2\u20132mJy. This implies that a minimum of\n20 per cent of the submm population (and possibly up to\n75 per cent) have 15-\u00b5m counterparts. A similar rate of cor-\nrespondence between the two populations, 20 per cent, was\nfound by Hughes et al. (1998) in the HDF, with Eales et\nal. (2000) finding a slightly lower rate (10 per cent) in their\nsample.\nThe long-wavelength photometer, ISOPHT, was also\nused to produce 175-\u00b5m maps of three of the fields included\nin our survey: A 370, Cl 2244\u221202 and MS 0440+02 for the\nprogramme RIVISON\/CLUSTERS. Despite long exposure\ntimes and large maps, not even the brightest sources in these\nfields (e.g. SMMJ02399\u22120136) were detected at 3\u2013\u03c3 flux\nlimits of \u223c 150mJy.\n4.5 X-ray properties\nX-ray observations of the submm galaxies provide a useful\naddition to our view of this population, in part because of\nthe ability of hard X-ray photons produced by AGN to es-\ncape from obscured environments. X-ray data can thus be\nused to search for obscured AGN in the submm population\nwhich might be partly responsible for the extreme luminosi-\nties of these sources. For this reason there has been consid-\nerable interest in obtaining hard X-ray observations of the\nsubmm population (Almaini, Lawrence & Boyle 1999; Gunn\n& Shanks 2001).\nThe high resolution X-ray imaging capabilities of the\nChandra X-ray satellite make it well suited to tackle this\nproblem. In contrast, although it has a much higher sen-\nsitivity to hard X-rays, data from XMM\/Newton are less\nideal for the cluster fields studied here \u2013 the lower spatial\nresolution making it difficult to detect any emission from\nthe submm galaxies above the strong cluster X-ray emis-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n12 Smail et al.\nFigure 6. I- and K-band frames of the fields of the submm sources in our sample (excluding the two central cluster galaxies), ordered\nin terms of their apparent 850-\u00b5m fluxes. The 850-\u00b5m map of each source is overlayed as a contour plot on the I-band frame, after\nconvolution with an 8\u2032\u2032-FWHM gaussian for display purposes. Note that the I- and K-band frames represent a range in depth and\nresolution, but they have all been smoothed (with a 0.5\u2032\u2032-FWHM Gaussian) to enhance the visibility of faint features. We identify the\nvarious confirmed or candidate counterparts and other galaxies discussed in the text on the individual panels. Each panel is 25\u2032\u2032-square\nand has north top and east to the left.\nsion. Fabian et al. (2000) discuss sensitive Chandra observa-\ntions of the submm sources in our A1835 and A 2390 fields,\nwhile Bautz et al. (2000) present somewhat deeper observa-\ntions of A 370. Excluding the central cluster galaxies, these\nobservations cover six of the submm sources in our sam-\nple; of these, only two are detected, both of which were al-\nready known to host semi-obscured AGNs on the basis of\ntheir optical and mid-IR emission (SMMJ02399\u22120136 and\nSMMJ02399\u22120134).\nTo extend this analysis to our full sample we have also\nmade use of deep archival ROSAT HRI images of all our\nfields. Details of the exposure times and sensitivities of the\nROSAT observations are given in Table 1. These lack both\nthe sensitivity and coverage of the hardest X-ray energies\ncompared to the recent Chandra observations; nevertheless,\nthey do allow us to place limits on the presence of strong X-\nray emission for all of the sources in our sample. We find that\nno sources have detectable X-ray counterparts down to 3-\u03c3\nflux limits of \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 in the 0.1\u20132.0 keV\nband (roughly 0.4\u20138 keV in the rest frame for most of these\nsources) after correcting for Galactic H i absorption. At a\nredshift of z \u223c 3 this translates into an X-ray luminosity\nin the 2\u201310 keV band of LX \u223c 3 \u00d7 1043 ergs, assuming an\nunobscured \u0393 = 2 power-law SED (see the discussion in\nBautz et al. 2000).\n4.6 Redshift constraints\nConstraining the redshifts of possible submm counterparts\ncan also provide a useful route to identifying the correct\ncounterpart to the submm source. These constraints can\ncome from either classical spectroscopy (Barger et al. 1999a)\nor photometric techniques employing optical, near-IR and\nlonger wavelength observations (e.g. Hughes et al. 1998; Lilly\net al. 1999; Smail et al. 2000). Moreover, determining the\nredshift distribution of the submm population is also impor-\ntant to provide a better understanding of the nature of these\ngalaxies, their relationship to other classes of high-redshift\nsource and their importance for models of galaxy formation\nand evolution. This is especially important for submm-wave\nsurveys, as the selection function is extremely broad, and so\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 13\na priori very high redshift galaxies could be included in the\nsample.\n4.6.1 Optical photometry\nPhotometric redshift techniques based on optical\/UV pho-\ntometry have been employed by Lilly et al. (1999) to attempt\nto determine the redshifts of candidate optical counterparts\nfound within the positional error box of submm sources. The\nresults suggested that the bulk of the submm population lies\nat z = 0.1\u20133. Hughes et al. (1998) used a photometric tech-\nnique spanning a larger wavelength range and deduced a\nrange of z = 2\u20134. Such analyses are based on template spec-\ntral energy distributions (SEDs) of local optically-selected\ngalaxies, as sampled in the rest-frame UV waveband if the\ngalaxies are at high redshifts. The diversity of the rest-frame\nUV\/optical properties of even local ULIRGs (Trentham et\nal. 1999) indicates that such analyses, which employ SED\ntemplates derived from \u2018normal\u2019 galaxies, are unlikely to be\nreliable. The SEDs of SCUBA galaxies with known redshifts\n(Ivison et al. 1998a, 2000a; Soucail et al. 1999) are also di-\nverse and unusual, while the many very red counterparts\n(Smail et al. 1999a; Dey et al. 1999; Ivison et al. 2000b; Gear\net al. 2000; Lutz et al. 2001) would not be well described by\nstandard photometric redshift templates.\n4.6.2 Optical spectroscopy\nIf optical counterparts could be identified for most submm\nsources then obviously optical spectroscopy would provide\nthe most direct route to obtain the redshift distribution of\nthe population, N(z). Based on the list of plausible optical\ncounterparts from Smail et al. (1998), a spectroscopic sur-\nvey was undertaken with the Keck telescope (Barger et al.\n1999a).\nIdentifications were attempted for all the galaxies bright\nenough for reliable spectroscopy within the SCUBA er-\nror circles. This resulted in spectroscopic redshifts or lim-\nits for 24 possible counterparts to 14 SCUBA sources\n(SMMJ04433+0210 and the two central cluster galaxies\nwere omitted from the survey). The median I-band mag-\nnitude of the counterparts is I = 22.4; the equivalent depth\nfor identifying candidates in a blank-field submm survey\nwould be closer to I \u223c 23.5 (Fig. 8), stretching the capa-\nbilities of even the largest telescopes. Importantly, however,\nBarger et al.\u2019s survey allows us to identify candidate coun-\nterparts containing AGN based on their spectral properties,\nand thus allows an upper limit to be imposed on the pro-\nportion of submm galaxies which host unobscured and par-\ntially obscured AGN. One route to rule out candidate optical\ncounterparts for SCUBA sources is to compare their opti-\ncal spectroscopic redshifts with redshift limits obtained from\ntheir radio and submm properties.\n4.6.3 Submm colours\nIn the absence of bright optical counterparts for most\nsubmm sources, and doubts over the applicability of stan-\ndard optical photometric methods for these dusty systems,\nwe must resort to other redshift indicators. Proposed tech-\nniques to estimate redshifts for faint submm galaxies come\nfrom the analysis of their long wavelength SEDs. For exam-\nple, as discussed by Hughes et al. (1998), the ratio of 450-\nand 850-\u00b5m fluxes, i.e. the spectral shape of dust emission\nin the rest-frame far-IR, can be used as a crude redshift\nindicator.\nThe analysis of the information provided by the 450-\n\u00b5m non-detections of the five 850-\u00b5m sources in the HDF\n(Hughes et al. 1998) suggested that the galaxies all lie at\nz > 1. A similar constraint comes from assuming that the\nsame population of sources are being detected at 450 and\n850\u00b5m, and then determining the flux density ratio between\nthe two wavelengths at a fixed source surface density. That\nthe redshift distributions of submm sources at the two wave-\nlengths are likely to be rather similar is supported by Eales\net al. (1999) and Blain et al. (1999b). The 450-\u00b5m counts are\n1000 deg\u22122 brighter than at a flux density limit of 20mJy.\nAt 850\u00b5m, this surface density is reached at a flux den-\nsity of about 6.5mJy. Thus the typical ratio S450\/S850 \u2243 3,\nsuggesting that <z>\u223c 3 if the dust temperature in the pop-\nulation is about 40k, see Fig. 1. This flux ratio is consistent\nwith the mean value 3.4 \u00b1 0.6 for the five galaxies detected\nat both wavelengths (see Table 2).\nA more reliable estimate of the redshifts of individual\nsources comes from fitting template SEDs to the entire far-\nIR\/submm\/mm SED, provided that sufficient information\nis available (see for example Ivison et al. 2000a; Frayer et al.\n2000; Smail et al. 1999a; Fox et al. 2001). We list the crude\nredshift ranges derived from this technique in Table 5. How-\never, it is vital to recognise that these estimated redshifts\ndepend strongly on the SED template that is assumed. Be-\ncause the dust spectrum is thermal, there is a strong degen-\neracy in the results between the detection of a cooler source\nat low redshift and a hotter source at a greater distance.\n4.6.4 Radio\u2013submm spectral index\nA method has been developed recently to estimate redshifts\nfor submm sources exploiting measurements of the 850 \u00b5m\nto 1.4GHz spectral spectral index, \u03b18501.4 (Carilli & Yun 1999,\n2000; Blain 1999; Dunne, Clements & Eales 2000; Barger,\nCowie & Richards 2000). This technique relies upon the\ntight correlation between the strength of the far-IR emis-\nsion (reprocessed UV\/optical radiation from massive stars)\nand radio emission (synchrotron emission from electrons ac-\ncelerated in supernovae from massive stars) observed in local\nstar-forming galaxies (Condon 1992).\nThe decline in emission from dust at longer wavelengths\nis eventually overtaken by the rising synchrotron emission\nto produce an upturn between the submm and radio wave-\nbands at around 3mm. This spectral feature is also observed\nin both high-redshift AGN and star-forming galaxies (see\nFig. 10). As proposed by Carilli & Yun (1999), the spectral\nindex observed across this break can be used to provide a\ncrude redshift estimate, with a larger spectral index indi-\ncating a higher redshift. The spectral index has the useful\nproperty that contamination by radio emission from an ob-\nscured radio-loud AGN will tend to reduce the value of \u03b18501.4 ,\nand thus lead to an underestimate of the redshift. Carilli &\nYun (1999, 2000) were able to show that the redshift predic-\ntions from \u03b18501.4 based on local template spectra and model\nSEDs were in good agreement with the observed redshifts\nfor a small sample of distant submm sources. Thus \u03b18501.4 can\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n14 Smail et al.\nFigure 7.

The\ndashed line indicates the approximate source-plane limits of our\nVLA 1.4-GHz maps. The solid line and hatched region shows the\nmedian value and 1-\u03c3 confidence limits for the S850 \u2265 4mJy\npopulation. The 850-\u00b5m fluxes and limits have been corrected for\nlens amplification using the estimated amplification factors from\nTable 4.\nbe used to place robust lower limits on the redshifts of the\nsubmm population.\nUsing the deep VLA 1.4-GHz maps of the seven clus-\nters in our survey (Table 1), Smail et al. (2000) identified\nradio counterparts to around half of the submm sources,\nwith useful limits on the remainder. They employed models\ndescribing the behaviour of \u03b18501.4 with redshift from Carilli\n& Yun (1999) and Blain (1999) to convert their \u03b18501.4 mea-\nsurements and limits into redshift ranges for the galaxies.\nUsing the updated models from Carilli & Yun (2000), which\ninclude a representation of the scatter expected in \u03b18501.4 as\na function of redshift, we estimate the redshift limits and\nranges, z\u03b1, for the individual submm galaxies and list these\nin Table 5.\nTaking the various estimates of submm source redshifts\nlisted in Table 5 we can place a crude limit on the median\nredshift of a complete sample of the submm galaxy popu-\nlation. We include both the reliable and possible spectro-\nscopic redshifts, distribute those galaxies for which upper\nlimits are available on z\u03b1 from the radio\u2013submm spectral\nindices uniformly across their allowed redshift ranges, and\nplace the remaining galaxies with only lower limits on z\u03b1\nat the minimum allowed redshift (Table 5). In this way we\nestimate a conservative lower limit of < z >= 2.3+0.8\u22121.1 (68\nper cent confidence limits) to the median redshift of the\nsubmm population brighter than 1mJy, with only a modest\nfraction of the submm population at z < 1. If we instead\nadopt a less conservative, more realistic, approach and uni-\nformly distribute those galaxies with only lower limits to z\u03b1\nacross a redshift range from z\u03b1 out to some maximum red-\nshift (z \u223c 6), we obtain a slightly higher median redshift\n< z >\u223c 2.6+1.9\u22121.4 (see Hughes et al. 1998; Fox et al. 2001).\nAt these redshifts and submm fluxes, all of the galaxies in\nour sample must be either ultraluminous or hyperluminous\ninfrared galaxies, LFIR \u223c 1012\u20131013 L\u2299.\nIn Figure 7 we illustrate the variation of radio\u2013submm\nspectral index with submm flux for the galaxies in our sam-\nple. The flat flux\u2013redshift relation for submm galaxies shown\nin Fig. 1 means that any correlation between the redshift-\ndependent spectral index and 850-\u00b5m flux must arise from\nintrinsic differences in the submm population as a function\nof luminosity. As pointed out by Smail et al. (2000), there\nis a hint that the submm galaxies at lower fluxes have typi-\ncally fainter radio counterparts and thus higher \u03b18501.4 values.\nHowever, this is at the limits of the sensitivity of even the\nvery deep radio maps used in our analysis. We discuss the\nvariation of the properties of the submm galaxies with their\nsubmm flux, as well as the sensitivity of our conclusions on\nthe median redshift of the population to the detailed prop-\nerties of the submm galaxies, in \u00a76.2.\n5 THE PROPERTIES OF INDIVIDUAL\nSUBMM GALAXIES\nIn the following we give a brief summary of the properties\nof the galaxies in our sample:\nSMMJ02399\u22120136 \u2013 This was the first high-redshift\nsubmm galaxy to be detected using SCUBA and remains\none of the brightest (850-\u00b5m flux of 23mJy based on a\nweighted mean of photometry and map measurements, Ivi-\nson et al. 1998a). It was quickly identified with a luminous\ninteracting\/merging galaxy, L1\/L2 at z = 2.80, with a far-\nIR luminosity of \u223c 1013L\u2299. Both components are resolved\nin our UKIRT K-band image with FWHM of \u223c 0.3\u20130.4\u2032\u2032 .\nThis system is a relatively bright mid-IR source seen by\nISOCAM (the flux densities have been revised to 0.13\u00b10.06\nand 0.47 \u00b1 0.05mJy at 7 and 15\u00b5m since those quoted by\nIvison et al. 1998a \u2013 Metcalfe et al. 2001, in prep). The two\ncomponents are each resolved by a 1.3\u2032\u2032 synthesised beam\nat 1.4GHz and appear to have different radio spectral in-\ndices (Ivison et al. 1999). The rest-frame UV spectrum ex-\nhibits high-ionisation lines with widths of \u223c 1000 kms\u22121\nleading to its classification as a Seyfert-2 galaxy (see also\nVernet & Cimatti 2001). However, the strong CO detec-\ntion of this galaxy suggests that around half of its luminos-\nity arises from a starburst, with the remaining half coming\nfrom the AGN (Frayer et al. 1998). Moreover, these obser-\nvations demonstrate the massive and relatively unevolved\nnature of this galaxy, with a large gas fraction, an SFR of\n\u223c 103M\u2299 yr\u22121 and an estimated gas reservoir amounting to\nM(H2) \u223c 2 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (this would probably be revised up-\nwards were CO(1 \u2192 0) data available \u2013 see Papadopoulos\net al. 2001). With this SFR, the galaxy could add another\n1011 M\u2299 of stars in the next 100Myr to its already consider-\nable stellar luminosity, LV \u223c 6L\u2217. We note that the recent\ndetection of this galaxy in hard X-rays by Chandra confirms\nthe presence of a partially obscured AGN in this source and\nalso supports the claim for a significant starburst contribu-\ntion to the total luminosity (Bautz et al. 2000).\nSMMJ00266+1708 \u2013 Frayer et al. (2000) present the\nidentification of this submm source with the galaxy M11\nbased upon 1-mm data from the OVRO Millimeter Array\ninterferometer. A faint near-IR counterpart was identified in\ntheir deep Keck K-band imaging (we list the properties of\nthis galaxy from their observations in Table 4). The current\nlimits on the I-band magnitude of this galaxy do not allow\nus to classify it as an ERO, but clearly it is very faint and\nred and so this classification is relatively academic. Based on\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 15\nthe long-wavelength SED of this source, Frayer et al. (2000)\nsuggest its redshift z \u223c 3.5 and that LFIR \u223c 1013 L\u2299.\nSMMJ09429+4658 \u2013 This source was originally identi-\nfied with the bright spiral, H1 (Smail et al. 1998). However,\nnear-IR imaging of this field turned up the counterpart H5,\none of two bright EROs identified in our UKIRT K-band\nsurvey. This galaxy is well resolved in the K-band image\nwith a seeing-corrected FWHM of 0.5\u00b1 0.1\u2032\u2032. This source is\ndiscussed in more length in Smail et al. (1999a) who estimate\na redshift of z \u223c 2.5 for this ULIRG (LFIR \u223c 2\u00d7 1013L\u2299).\nSMMJ14009+0252 \u2013 The counterpart (J5) to this\nsubmm source is extremely faint in the near-IR (and even\nfainter in the optical). However, there is relatively bright\nradio emission associated with this galaxy (Table 5), unre-\nsolved in a sensitive 1.5\u2032\u2032-resolution VLA map of the field,\nand the accurate position allowed us to pinpoint the posi-\ntion of the submm galaxy with sufficient accuracy to warrant\na deeper near-IR observation. A near-IR counterpart was\neventually detected with K \u223c 21.0 (Ivison et al. 2000a) al-\nthough it remains undetected in a very recent HST WFPC2\nF702W exposure, indicating it has (R\u2212K) > 5.6 (Table 4)\nand therefore classes as an ERO. Balancing the high redshift\nsuggested by the S450\/S850 flux ratio and the low redshift\ngiven by the \u03b18401.4 estimator, Ivison et al. (2000a) suggest\nthat this source lies at z \u223c 4 and class the galaxy as a hyper-\nluminous IR galaxy, > 1013L\u2299 with a probable AGN-based\ncontribution to its radio emission.\nSMMJ14011+0252 \u2013 Ivison et al. (2000a) present de-\ntailed observations of this submm source, which is identified\nwith a z = 2.56 interacting\/merging pair of galaxies, J1\/J2,\nwith a far-IR luminosity of LFIR \u223c 6\u00d71012 L\u2299. Both optical\ncomponents are resolved at K, J1 being larger (1.05\u00b10.05\u2032\u2032)\nthan J2 (0.4 \u00b1 0.1\u2032\u2032). The optical spectra of these galaxies\nshow no hint of AGN characteristics (Barger et al. 1999a)\nand the system is undetected in recent hard X-ray obser-\nvations with Chandra (Fabian et al. 2000), supporting the\ncontention that its luminosity is predominantly produced by\na intense starburst (Ivison et al. 2000a). The resolution of\nthe 1.4-GHz radio emission from SMMJ14011+0252 in our\nVLA A+B-array observations also suggests that the far-IR\nemission from this galaxy is powered by a starburst (Ivison\net al. 2001b). Based on optical photometry of the galaxy\npair, Adelberger & Steidel (2000) noted that J1\/J2 also\nclasses as a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG). However, strong\ncolour differences exist within this system and it is not\nclear that the source of the starburst activity will have\ncolours typical of a LBG. Indeed, the high-resolution study\nof SMMJ14011+0252 by Ivison et al. (2001b) suggests that\nthe starburst region lies outside the optical extent of the sys-\ntem, close to a previously unidentified extremely red com-\nponent. The CO detection of this galaxy by Frayer et al.\n(1999), with a relatively narrow linewidth, indicates that it\nhas a large gas reservoir (M(H2) \u223c 1011 M\u2299) and that the\ngas fraction is high (see also Ivison et al. 2001b).\nSMMJ02399\u22120134 \u2013 This submm source is identified\nwith L3, a ring-galaxy at z = 1.06 (FWHM in K: 0.6\u00b10.1\u2032\u2032),\nwhich is also a relatively bright VLA 1.4-GHz source and an\nISOCAM 7- and 15-\u00b5m source (with a 15-\u00b5m flux density\nrevised to 1.4 \u00b1 0.1mJy since that quoted by Soucail et al.\n1999 \u2014 Metcalfe et al. in prep). Optical spectroscopy (and\nanalysis of the mid-IR colours) shows that the galaxy is a\nSeyfert 1.5\u20132, and the presence of an obscured AGN was\nrecently confirmed through a detection in the hard X-ray\nband by Chandra (Bautz et al. 2000). The lensing-corrected\nfar-IR luminosity of this source is LFIR \u223c 6.5 \u00d7 1012 L\u2299.\nMore information about this galaxy is provided by Soucail\net al. (1999) and Kneib et al. (2002).\nSMMJ22471\u22120206 \u2013 There are several possible candi-\ndate counterparts to this submm source (Fig. 6), at least two\nof which (P1 and P4) exhibit sufficiently unusual morpholo-\ngies to be worthy of further consideration. The morpholo-\ngies of these in the HST I-band image of this field show\nP4 has a bright, compact core with an unresolved arc of\nemission around it, while P1 exhibits a faint, \u2018tadpole\u2019-like\ntail (Fig. 6). Barger et al. (1999a) obtained optical spec-\ntroscopy of both of these galaxies and conclude that P4\nhas z = 1.16 and shows weak AGN characteristics (broad\nMg ii\u03bb2800 emission), while P1 (K = 20.1, (I \u2212K) = 3.0)\nhas a featureless spectrum and probably lies at z \u223c 2. The\nrelatively red colours and AGN signatures in P4 suggest that\nit is likely to be the correct counterpart, although the low\nredshift of this galaxy compared to the radio-submm spec-\ntral index estimates (Table 5) does raise some doubts.\nSMMJ02400\u22120134 \u2013 This source was classified as a\n\u2018blank field\u2019 by Smail et al. (1998) and that classification\nstill stands. This is the brightest submm source in the sam-\nple without a reliable counterpart, but given the depth of\nthe available near-IR data and the properties of some of the\nconfirmed counterparts to brighter submm sources, this is\nnot particularly surprising (Table 4). Deeper near-IR obser-\nvations of this region are required to identify any possible\ncounterpart to this source. We note that there are no obvious\ncounterparts in either the ISOCAM 15-\u00b5m map (Metcalfe\net al. 1999; Biviano et al. 2000) or the Chandra hard X-ray\nimage of this field (Bautz et al. 2000) which both argue for\na high redshift on K-correction grounds.\nSMMJ04431+0210 \u2013 The near-IR counterpart, N4, to\nthis source is one of the EROs identified in the sample (Smail\net al. 1999a). This galaxy lies very close to an edge-on spi-\nral member of the foreground cluster lens, which was the\nidentification originally proposed by Smail et al. (1998). Its\nextreme optical-IR colour mean that it is invisible on deep\nHST and Keck optical images of this field, although it is\nwell-detected in the K-band with an estimated FWHM of\n0.4\u00b10.1\u2032\u2032 after correcting for lens amplification. Smail et al.\n(1999a) discuss various redshift constraints for this source\nand suggest that it probably lies at z \u223c 3 \u00b1 0.5 and has\nLFIR \u223c 5\u00d71012 L\u2299. There is a small additional contribution\nto the amplification of this source caused by the proximity\nof the foreground spiral galaxy.\nThe following sources are the fainter half of our sample, with\nintrinsic fluxes of <\u223c 4mJy. Our follow-up of these sources has\nnot been as extensive as the studies of the brighter sources\ndiscussed above, and so the information available is more\nlimited and our discussion is necessarily more speculative.\nSMMJ21536+1742 \u2013 There are several optically faint\ncandidate counterparts in the vicinity of this submm source.\nBarger et al. (1999a) obtained spectroscopy of two: K2, for\nwhich they suggest a possible redshift of z = 1.60 from a\nlow signal-to-noise spectrum; and K3, an absorption-line\ngalaxy at z = 1.02 which appears to be weakly detected\nin the ISOCAM 15-\u00b5m image of this field at a flux of\n\u223c 0.2mJy (Le\u00b4monon et al. 1998). K3 has K \u223c 18.5 and\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n16 Smail et al.\n(I\u2212K) = 4.7\u00b10.1, excluding the northern end of the galaxy\nwhich is apparently blended with a blue point source \u2013 the\neffect of this blend on the spectroscopic observations is un-\nknown. The colours of K3 are too red for a passive stellar\npopulation at z \u223c 1 and suggest that dust plays a role in\nits apparent properties, in agreement with its detection at\n15\u00b5m. Given the unusual properties of K3 we suggest that\nit may contribute to the submm emission in this region, per-\nhaps confusing an optically fainter submm source closer to\nthe position of K2. The reduced sensitivity of the 1.4-GHz\nmap of this field (due to the bright central galaxy) hinders\nthe resolution of this question.\nSMMJ00265+1710 \u2013 The bright galaxies to the south of\nthis source (M6 in Fig. 6) are in the foreground of the cluster\nat z = 0.21 (Barger et al. 1999a) and, apart from these,\nno additional spectroscopy is available. Smail et al. (2000)\nidentify a radio source outside of the nominal submm error\nbox which could be the counterpart. This radio emission may\nbe associated with the faint, extended galaxy to the north-\neast which has K = 19.7\u00b1 0.2 and (I \u2212K) = 2.8\u00b1 0.2. We\nnote that 15-\u00b5m observations were taken of this field with\nISOCAM, which may help in disentangling the identification\nof this source.\nSMMJ22472\u22120206 \u2013 There are several faint galaxies\nin the vicinity of this submm source. Barger et al. (1999a)\nsuggested a possible redshift of z = 2.11 for P2, consistent\nwith the non-detection of this submm source at 1.4GHz. To\nthe south, P6 is relatively faint and blue (I = 24.5, (I\u2212K) <\n2.8), and a very faint and apparently very red galaxy (P7\nin Fig. 6) is just visible to the south of an I \u223c 24 galaxy\neast of P2. P7 is only just detected in our UKIRT K-band\nimage, but it appears to be an ERO with K = 20.7\u00b10.3 and\n(I \u2212K) > 5. Again this field is a candidate for a confused\nsource arising from a blend of two submm sources associated\nwith P2 and possibly P7.\nSMMJ00266+1710 \u2013 Another apparently blank field.\nThe proximity of the arclet, M3, to this source led Smail\net al. (1998) to suggest this was a possible counterpart.\nHowever, the comparison of the arclet\u2019s redshift, z = 0.94\n(Barger et al. 1999a) and the redshift estimate from the\n\u03b18501.4 limit, z > 1.9, suggests that this interpretation is in-\ncorrect, and the true counterpart must therefore be signif-\nicantly fainter; we therefore classify this is as a probable\nblank field. Nevertheless, the highly distorted morphology\nof the arclet, produced by the gravitational lens, gives a\ngraphic illustration of the likely amplification suffered by\nthis submm source. Indeed, if the source redshift is signif-\nicantly greater than z \u223c 1 it is probable that this source\nactually comprises a blend of the brightest two images of a\nmultiply-imaged submm galaxy. The third image would be\nbelow the detection threshold of our SCUBA map.\nSMMJ00267+1709 \u2013 This field is classified as blank in\nthe analyses of Smail et al. (1998) and Barger et al. (1999a).\nOur relatively shallow UKIRT K-band image has not re-\nvealed any galaxies with K < 20.6 which are undetected in\nthe HST I-band image (Fig. 6) and so our classification for\nthis source remains as a blank field.\nSMMJ04433+0210 \u2013 This submm source has the low-\nest apparent flux of any of the sources in our catalogue and\nunfortunately falls outside the archival WFPC2 F702W ex-\nposure of this field (Smail et al. 1998). Optical imaging cov-\nering this source was only acquired after the spectroscopic\nFigure 8.

There ap-\npears to be a relatively bright candidate optical and radio\ncounterpart to this submm source, N5.\nThe following two submm sources are both identified with\nthe central galaxies in the lensing clusters used in our survey:\nSMMJ21536+1741 \u2013 This source corresponds with the\ncentral galaxy in the lensing cluster A 2390 (z = 0.23).\nSMMJ14010+0252 \u2013 This source has also been iden-\ntified with the central galaxy in the cluster lens A 1835 at\nz = 0.25. Unlike SMMJ21536+1741, this galaxy appears to\nbe undergoing significant star-formation activity (see Edge\net al. 1999 for a more detailed discussion of both central\ngalaxies).\n6 THE PROPERTIES OF THE SUBMM\nPOPULATION\nWe begin our discussion of the nature of the submm popu-\nlation by focusing on the properties of these galaxies as out-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 17\nlined in the previous sections. We start with those observ-\nables which are available for the whole sample, such as the\ncharacteristics of their SEDs, before turning to more detailed\ninformation which only exists for a subset of the sample. As\nthe detailed follow-up work has concentrated on the brighter\nsources in our survey (e.g. Frayer et al. 2000), we will rely\non their properties when discussing the detailed characteris-\ntics of the submm population, bringing in the fainter sources\nwhere there are suggestions of differences in their behaviour.\n6.1 Optical and near-infrared properties\nThe discussion in \u00a75 of the optical and near-IR counter-\nparts to the individual submm sources highlighted the wide\nrange in the properties of submm galaxies at these wave-\nlengths: although the sources span less than an order of\nmagnitude in their submm fluxes, their counterparts span\nthree orders of magnitude in their optical fluxes. In an at-\ntempt to identify some structure in this variety, Ivison et al.\n(2000b) suggested a phenomenological classification scheme\nfor the counterparts to submm sources, analogous to that\nused for protostars (Adams et al. 1987). They defined three\nbroad classes related to the observational properties of likely\ncounterparts using operational definitions based upon the\ntypical depths achieved in follow-up observations (I \u223c 26,\nK \u223c 21, Fig. 8). This magnitude limit in the near-IR cor-\nresponds roughly to an unobscured L\u2217 galaxy at z > 2\u20132.5,\nwhereas the effective dividing line in colour, (I\u2212K) > 5, use-\nfully separates the colours expected from unreddened stellar\npopulations at z <\u223c 6 from those exhibited by dusty galax-\nies (Pozzetti & Mannucci 2000). This classification scheme\ntherefore provides a crude differentiation between counter-\nparts where dust is likely to play a significant role in the\noptical\/IR colours and luminosity of the galaxy from those\nwhere it does not.\nIn the Ivison et al. scheme, Class-0 objects are faint\nin both optical and near-IR passband, with K >\u223c 21 and\nI >\u223c 26; these are likely to be either highly obscured or very\nhigh-redshift galaxies (here we also include those sources\nwhich are sufficiently faint in the optical that they cannot\nbe spectroscopically identified, I >\u223c 23.5). Class-I sources\nhave counterparts in the near-IR brighter than K \u223c 21,\nbut not in the optical (I > 26) and hence will be EROs.\nFinally, Class-II sources have obvious optical and near-IR\ncounterparts. When spectroscopic information is available\nfor Classes I and II, they can be further subdivided into\nthe three spectroscopic types used to classify local ULIRGs\n(e.g. Sanders et al. 1988): a, pure starburst; b, type-II AGN,\nnarrow-line but high excitation spectra such as Seyfert 2;\nand c, type-I AGN, e.g. classical broad-line AGN such as\nSeyfert 1. Class II submm sources may overlap with the\nmost strongly star-forming and massive LBGs and QSOs.\nWe plot the possible counterparts to the 15 submm\nsources discussed in \u00a75 on the (I \u2212K)\u2013K colour-magnitude\nplane in Fig. 8 and overplot the classification boundaries. We\nalso show the colour\u2013magnitude redshift tracks expected for\nluminous galaxies with UV\/optical SEDs similar to the three\nULIRGs studied by Trentham et al. (1999). These illustrate\nthe wide variation in rest-frame UV\/optical obscuration en-\ncountered in this population locally.\nWe find that our sample consists of 8\u20139 Class-0 coun-\nterparts (60 per cent), 2\u20133 in Class I (15 per cent) and 4\n(25 per cent) in Class II, depending upon the exact bound-\naries adopted. It is clear that the majority of the submm\nsources are extremely faint in optical wavebands and will\nthus be difficult to detect in optical surveys for high-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies. The four Class-II galaxies for which\nthere are detailed spectroscopic observations can be further\nsub-divided into one Class-IIa star-forming galaxy and three\nClass-IIb obscured AGN. Although many of the submm\nsources with optical counterparts exhibit some level of AGN\nactivity, the presence of strong stellar absorption features in\ntheir optical spectra indicate that the non-thermal emission\ndoes not dominate in the optical\/near-IR wavebands.\nComparing the colours and magnitudes of the submm\nsources with the tracks from Trentham et al. (1999) in\nFig. 8, we see that the four Class-II galaxies have colours\nand brightnesses consistent with those expected for \u226b L\u2217\ngalaxies with ULIRG-like UV\/optical SEDs at z \u223c 1\u20133. The\n2\u20133 Class-I sources have colours similar to the reddest of\nthe local ULIRGs placed at z >\u223c 2, with apparent magni-\ntudes suggesting that they too have extreme rest-frame op-\ntical luminosities, \u223c 5L\u2217K (much higher than seen in similar\nlocal systems, Trentham priv. comm.). Clearly, the lumi-\nnous submm galaxies in both of these classes have already\nbuilt up considerable stellar populations. Finally, even the\nrelatively blue colours of some of the optical sources within\nthe Class 0 error boxes are still consistent with the colours\nof the bluest local ULIRGs, and so cannot be ruled out as\npossible counterparts to the submm sources without further\ninformation.\nFigure 9a displays the K-band magnitudes or limits for\nthe submm galaxies, as a function of their apparent 850-\u00b5m\nfluxes (both corrected for lens amplification). As expected,\nthe very different behaviour of the K-correction in these two\nwavebands results in little correlation between the bright-\nness of galaxies in the submm and near-IR wavebands, with\nthe brightest submm galaxies in our sample spanning a range\nof 6 mag. (250\u00d7) in theK band. Nevertheless, it does appear\nthat bright near-IR counterparts are not seen for the faintest\nsubmm galaxies, with S850 <\u223c 4mJy, which typically show\nonly very faint K-band counterparts (the majority simply\nbeing upper limits). This may reflect real differences in the\nmix of classes seen at high and low far-IR luminosities, or\nalternatively could simply result from the small sample size.\nEither way, the possibility of a difference between the bright\nand faint submm galaxies undermines attempts to extrapo-\nlate the properties of the most luminous submm sources to\nthe fainter sources which dominate the far-IR extragalactic\nbackground (FIRB).\nWe conclude this section by briefly discussing the near-\nIR (rest-frame optical) morphologies of the Class-I and II\nsources (Fig. 6; see also Ivison et al. 1998a, 2000a and Smail\net al. 1999a). Where the available imaging has sufficient sig-\nnal to noise we find that all of the sources have extended rest-\nframe optical emission (\u00a75), with intrinsic FWHM of 0.5\u20131\u2032\u2032\n(or 5\u201310 kpc at z \u223c 2\u20133), with several comprising multi-\nple components (e.g. L1\/L2, J1\/J2, L3). Concentrating on\nthe multiple-component systems, L1\/L2 and J1\/J2, we note\nthat the spatial separation of the individual components\nwithin these systems is 2\u20133\u2032\u2032, corresponding to \u223c 10 kpc\nin the source plane. Such large separations are claimed to\nbe relatively rare in local ULIRG mergers (Murphy et al.\n1996; Solomon et al. 1997; although see Rigopoulou et al.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n18 Smail et al.\nFigure 9. a) The distribution as a function of apparent 850-\u00b5m flux of the apparent K-band magnitudes of counterparts for the submm\nsources. The dashed line indicates the approximate source-plane limits of our UKIRT K-band imaging. The solid line and hatched region\nshows the median value and 1-\u03c3 confidence limits for the S850 \u2265 4mJy population. Note the very wide range in K-band magnitude\nexhibited by the brightest submm sources, S850 >\u223c 4mJy, whereas the faintest submm sources do not typically possess bright K-band\ncounterparts. b) The distribution of the K-band magnitude of the counterparts against radio\u2013submm spectral index, \u03b18501.4 . There appears\nto be a weak trend for fainter counterparts to have higher \u03b18501.4 values, although the scatter is considerable. The 850\u00b5m flux and K-band\nmagnitudes in both panels are corrected for lens amplification using the values given in Table 4.\n1999) and may suggest that ULIRG phase occurs at a much\nearlier stage of mergers at high redshift, either because of\ntheir higher gas fractions or due to other factors which lower\nthe stability of their gas reservoirs (e.g. the absence of a\nstrong bulge component, Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Bekki\net al. 1999). A deeper survey of the restframe optical mor-\nphologies of the complete sample must await the revival of\nNICMOS on-board HST.\n6.2 Submm, far-IR and radio properties\nThe submm galaxies for which we have good informa-\ntion on their rest-frame SEDs are naturally those with\nreliable redshifts. We show in Fig. 10 the SEDs for\nSMMJ02399\u22120136 at z = 2.80, SMMJ14011+0252 at z =\n2.56 and SMMJ02399\u22120134 at z = 1.06, covering the rest-\nframe wavelength region from the near-IR to the radio. The\nspectroscopic observations show that SMMJ02399\u22120136\nand SMMJ02399\u22120134 both host obscured AGN, while\nSMMJ14011+0252 appears to be a pure starburst (\u00a75). Of\nthe three, SMMJ02399\u22120136 is the most luminous, but the\nother two systems have comparable bolometric luminosities.\nHowever, irrespective of their different optical spectra and\nluminosities, Fig. 10 shows that these three submm-selected\ngalaxies have very similar far-IR SEDs. The only signifi-\ncant difference occurs in the radio waveband, at rest-frame\nfrequencies about 4GHz, where the three radio-quiet galax-\nies differ by a factor of \u223c 5 in flux density. The brightest\nis SMMJ02399\u22120136, followed by SMMJ02399\u22120134 and\nthen SMMJ14011+0252. We interpret this sequence as aris-\ning from an increasing contribution from an active nucleus\ngoing from the pure starburst (SMMJ14011+0252) to a lu-\nminous type-2 AGN in SMMJ02399\u22120136. Apart from a\nweak contribution in the radio, this change makes little over-\nall difference to the radio\u2013far-IR SEDs of the galaxies, how-\never it does illustrate the degree of uncertainty which should\nbe expected when trying to use the radio\u2013submm spectral\n100000100001000100101\n100000 10000 1000 100 10 1\nSMM J14011+0252, z=2.56\nSMM J02399-0136, z=2.80\nSMM J02399-0134, z=1.06\nSC\nUB\nA\nISOCAM\nIRAS\nVLA\nT(\ndu\nst)\n=3\n7K\n, \u03b2\n=\n+\n1.\n5\n\u03b1\n=\n-0.8\n\u03b1\n=\n-1.95\nRest frequency  \/GHz\nN\nor\nm\nal\nise\nd \nflu\nx \nde\nns\nity\nRest wavelength  \/\u00b5m\nFigure 10. The rest-frame SEDs for the three submm\ngalaxies in our survey with reliable spectroscopic redshifts:\nSMMJ02399\u22120136 (L1\/L2), SMMJ14011+0252 (J1\/J2) and\nSMMJ02399\u22120134 (L3), normalised in flux density at a rest-\nframe wavelength of 250 \u00b5m. We overplot the best-fit SED used\nto model the FIRB and counts, as discussed in \u00a76.5: a greybody\nwith Td = 37k, \u03b2 = +1.5, with power-laws of index \u03b1 = \u22121.95\n(where F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd+\u03b1) beyond 60\u00b5m, and \u03b1 = \u22120.80 from 1.4GHz\nto 3mm.\nindex as a redshift estimator for galaxies hosting radio-loud\nAGN. The range in rest-frame radio power shown by the\nthree galaxies compared here would result in a systematic\nreduction of the spectral index by \u03b4\u03b18501.4 = \u22120.3, and an\nequivalent reduction in the estimated redshift of the source.\nAt the shorter wavelengths covered by Fig. 10, we see\nthat the SEDs are poorly constrained between 10\u2013100 \u00b5m\nin the rest frame, a situation that should soon be resolved\nby SOFIA and SIRTF. At the slightly longer wavelengths\nobserved by SCUBA, we find the average SED of the three\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 19\ngalaxies is consistent with the characteristic spectral index\n\u03b1 \u2243 3.5 \u00b1 0.5, of optically-thin emission from dust grains.\nSimple fits to this composite SED cannot, of course, accu-\nrately constrain the dust temperature, although the data for\nall three galaxies are consistent with the Td range of 35\u201350 k\nfound for other dusty, high-redshift systems (Benford et al.\n1999). Higher temperatures can only be fitted if the opac-\nity of the dust becomes significant at wavelengths of about\n100\u2013200 \u00b5m.\nAs mentioned in \u00a74.6, the redshifts estimated from the\nspectral index are sensitive to the assumed temperature of\nthe dust, Td, in the submm galaxies (Blain 1999) and so\nreducing Td would allow a lower median redshift for the\npopulation. However, only if we force the entire submm pop-\nulation to have a characteristic dust temperature less than\n30k can we start to push the median redshift much below\n<z>\u223c 2. There is no evidence for such a cold characteristic\ntemperature in any of the brighter submm galaxies with con-\nfirmed identifications and redshifts, nor is there any physical\nreason to expect that dust in high-redshift starbursts should\nbe any cooler than that in local LIRGs and ULIRGs.\nLooking at the population as a whole, if typical submm-\nselected galaxies have cool dust temperatures (and thus lay\nat low redshifts), for example an analogue of the Milky Way\nwith \u223c 17k (Reach et al. 1995), they would be detectable at\nthe mJy level using SCUBA and at the \u00b5Jy level using the\nVLA, consistent with the observations. However, their opti-\ncal counterparts would be very bright in HST and ground-\nbased follow-up images. Based on the data presented here,\nsuch sources can only represent a few per cent of SCUBA-\nselected galaxies.\nIs there any evidence for differences in dust temperature\nwithin the submm population? Fig. 9b illustrates the varia-\ntion in amplification-corrected apparent K-band magnitude\nwith radio-submm spectral index of the source. There may\nbe a weak tendency for sources with higher \u03b18501.4 indices to\nhave fainter counterparts, but any trend is weakened by the\nlarge scatter, a factor of 100 at a fixed \u03b18501.4 . This large scat-\nter may reflect both the crudeness of \u03b18501.4 as a redshift indi-\ncator and the strong variation in the rest-frame UV\/optical\nobscuration in the submm population.\nHigher values of \u03b18501.4 are expected to correspond to\ngalaxies with either higher redshifts for the same SED, or\nto cooler dust temperatures for the same redshift (Blain\n1999). The observations are consistent with either expla-\nnation. If the redshift distribution is systematically higher\nfor fainter sources \u2013 a straightforward explanation, and one\nthat is hinted at in Fig. 9b \u2013 then it will be difficult to test\nthis idea, as the brightness of the counterpart to the submm\nsource will be reduced in all other wavebands. The distri-\nbution of the K-band counterparts in Fig. 9a suggests that\nthe fainter submm sources may indeed have fainter near-IR\ncounterparts, which would support this suggestion, although\nthis could simply indicate that the fainter sources are more\nobscured. Alternatively, if the fainter sources are system-\natically cooler, then the bolometric luminosity derived for\nthem, as associated with a given 850-\u00b5m flux density, will\nbe much less as compared with that estimated using a hotter\ndust temperature, and so their counterparts in other wave-\nbands would also be expected to be systematically fainter;\nhowever, the typically lower redshift of the counterparts\nmight make their detection in the K-band easier in this\ncase. The resolution of this issue awaits both accurate multi-\nband photometry of submm-selected galaxies using SIRTF\nand SOFIA at wavelengths corresponding to the rest-frame\npeak of their SED, and the measurement of redshifts for\nsubmm galaxies over a wider range of flux density.\nUsing the new estimates for the redshifts and limits\nfrom \u00a74.6.4, listed in Table 5, we conclude that at least half\nof the submm population down to a median intrinsic 850-\u00b5m\nflux of \u223c 3\u20134mJy have redshifts above z = 2. This result is\nconsistent with the expectations from the 450-\/850-\u00b5m flux\nratios discussed in \u00a74.6.3.\nIf the median redshift of the submm population is z > 2\nand we adopt a mid-IR SED for the galaxies similar to\nArp 220 then their predicted 15-\u00b5m fluxes would typically\nbe < 10\u00b5Jy \u2013 well below the ISOCAM detection limit. The\nrelatively high rate of ISOCAM 15-\u00b5m detections we find\ntherefore suggests that Arp 220 is not a good prototype for\nthe mid-IR SED of a faint submm galaxy, which are typically\nbrighter at mid-IR wavelengths. Fig. 11 illustrates the mid-\nIR\u2013submm spectral indices of the current sample of galaxies\nwith both SCUBA and ISO observations (or limits) along\nwith the behaviour expected from a number of SEDs. The\nobservations appear to rule out Arp 220\u2013like SEDs in the\nmid-IR (which are too red), but are well described by model\nSEDs of less optically-thick starbursts (Dale et al. 2001;\nEales et al. 2000). Fig. 11 also illustrates the behaviour of\nthe mid-IR\u2013submm spectral index from the composite SED\nused by Blain et al. (1999b) to model the FIRB and counts\n(see \u00a77), including the faint counts of galaxies detected by\nISOCAM at 15\u00b5m and the deep counts of radio galaxies de-\ntermined at frequencies of 1.4 and 8.4GHz using the VLA\n(see \u00a76.5). This SED has Td = 37k, \u03b2 = +1.5 and a mid-IR\nspectral index of \u22121.95, and lies on the low-redshift far-IR\u2013\nradio correlation. It clearly provides an adequate represen-\ntation of the behaviour of individual galaxies in the mid-IR\nwaveband.\n6.3 Dynamical, gas and dust masses\nDynamical information is available for three galaxies\nin our sample: SMMJ02399\u22120136 (Frayer et al. 1998);\nSMMJ14011+0252 (Frayer et al. 1999; Ivison et al. 2001b)\nand SMMJ02399\u22120134 (Kneib et al. 2002). This comes from\nmapping redshifted CO line emission in these galaxies with\nthe OVRO and IRAM interferometers. The width of the\nmolecular line provides an estimate of the dynamical mass\nof the system, while the strength of the line can be used to\nestimate the total molecular gas mass of the systems, as-\nsuming a conversion from CO gas mass to total molecular\ngas mass (mostly H2), an assumption which may be uncer-\ntain at the factor of >\u223c 4 level (Downes & Solomon 1998;\nPapadopoulos et al. 2001).\nIt is interesting to note that although\nSMMJ02399\u22120136 and SMMJ14011+0252 have very differ-\nent optical classifications, they have very similar (and high)\nfar-IR to CO ratios: LFIR\/L\n\u2032\nCO \u223c 500 L\u2299 k\u22121 km s\u22121 pc\u22122,\nat the high end of the values seen in local ULIRGs (Solomon\net al. 1997). This suggests that their prodigious far-IR lumi-\nnosities are powered by similar physical processes, probably\nhighly efficient star formation (Solomon 2001).\nThe dynamical masses in the central 10\u201320 kpc infered\nfor these systems are 1\u20132\u00d7 1011 sin\u22122(i)M\u2299 (where i is the\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n20 Smail et al.\nFigure 11.

We show the\nexpected variation in the spectral index for the SED of Arp220,\nthe starburst SED from Eales et al. (2000), the most active SED\nfrom Dale et al. (2001) and the best-fit SED used to fit the mid-\nand far-IR background from Blain et al. (1999b) (assuming Td =\n37k, \u03b2 = +1.5 and a mid-IR spectral index, \u22121.95). We plot the\nmeasurements from the SCUBA Lens Survey as filled symbols,\nthe open symbols show joint SCUBA and ISOCAM detections\nfrom Hughes et al. (1998) and Eales et al. (2000). The upper\nlimit represents the typical limits on the \u223c80 per cent of the\nsubmm sources undetected by ISOCAM from Eales et al. (2000)\nand Hughes et al. (1998).\nunknown inclination angle), while their total molecular gas\nmasses are estimated at 1\u20132 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299, assuming a CO lu-\nminosity to molecular gas mass conversion factor, \u03b1 = 4M\u2299\n(k kms\u22121 pc2)\u22121. This suggests that molecular gas is a dy-\nnamically important, and perhaps dominant, constituent in\nthe central \u223c 10 kpc of these galaxies (see Frayer et al. 1998,\n1999). Combining these dynamic mass estimates with the\nmeasured rest-frame optical luminosities of these galaxies\nwe find very low mass-to-light ratios: Mdyn\/LV \u223c 0.3, as\nexpected for star-forming systems dominated by very recent\nstar formation, \u223c 100Myrs (Salasnich et al. 2000).\nAdopting kd = 0.15(\u03bb0\/800 \u00b5m)\n\u22121.5 for the standard\ndust emission parameter, where \u03bb0 is the rest-frame wave-\nlength, in order to compare the results with other distant\nsources, we estimate dust masses of Md = 0.5\u20135 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\nfor the typical submm galaxies in our sample, based on dust\ntemperatures of Td = 40 \u00b1 10k (see \u00a76.2). Given the mod-\nest dust yield from a standard IMF, these large dust masses\nprovide further support for the high SFRs claimed for these\ngalaxies, assuming of course that type-II supernovae are a\nsignificant source of dust in the early Universe, which has\nyet to be demonstrated convincingly.\n6.4 Power source: AGN versus starburst\nThe source of the extreme luminosities of the submm galaxy\npopulation detected by SCUBA remains a key problem for\ninterpreting their nature and their relevance for models of\ngalaxy formation and evolution. Unfortunately, submm ob-\nservations alone are unable to discriminate between lumi-\nnous dusty galaxies powered by massive stars or AGN, al-\nthough the resolution of a handful of sources in the radio\nor millimeter on scales of <\u223c 5\n\u2032\u2032 suggests that the submm\nemission from these galaxies comes from an extended region\nrather than a central AGN (or in fact nuclear starburst).\nThis result cautions against the use of very high resolution\nradio or millimeter facilities for surveys to identify this pop-\nulation.\nWhile it is plausible that AGN powered dusty galaxies\ncould on average have hotter dust temperatures, rendering\nthem less likely to be selected in submm surveys (Fig. 1),\nat present there is insufficient information to confirm this.\nWe therefore have to resort to secondary indicators of AGN\nactivity to determine their prevalence in the submm popula-\ntion as a whole. We stress that even when an AGN is known\nto be present, determining its contribution to the overall en-\nergetics of the submm emission is still far from trivial (e.g.\nFrayer et al. 1998, 1999).\nThere are at least three unambigious examples in our\nsample of submm galaxies which harbour AGN nuclei:\nL1\/L2, L3 and P4 (Table 5), all based on broad lines vis-\nible in optical spectroscopy. In all three cases these AGN\nshow signatures of dust obscuration in their line ratios. For\nthe optically-faint majority of the sample, however, we have\nto rely on other tracers of AGN activity, the most powerful\nbeing hard X-ray emission (Fabian et al. 2000; Bautz et al.\n2000; Hornschemeier et al. 2000; Page et al. 2001).\nUsing the ROSAT X-ray limits from \u00a74.5 and our ob-\nserved submm fluxes for the individual sources, we estimate\nthat the typical submm galaxy has a submm\u2013X-ray spec-\ntral index, \u03b1SX (Fabian et al. 2000), of \u03b1\nS\nX\n>\u223c 1.1 (assuming\na \u0393 = 2 power-law for the X-ray emission). We compare\nthe limits on \u03b1SX for the submm sources with five quasars\nat z > 4 using the combined ROSAT X-ray observations of\nKaspi et al. (2000) and submm photometry from McMahon\net al. (1999). These quasars have \u03b1SX \u223c 0.9 \u00b1 0.1, with the\nmost submm-luminous example being BR 1202\u22120725 with\n\u03b1SX \u223c 1.1. We conclude that if AGN are present in typi-\ncal submm galaxies then they are more obscured than the\ndusty and gas-rich z = 4.69 QSO BR1202\u22120725 (Omont\net al. 1996). To better quantify this statement, we use the\nobscured AGN models from Fabian et al. (2000) and Gunn\n& Shanks (2001) and suggest that if AGN are present in the\ntypical submm galaxy then they must be lie behind columns\nof N(Hi) > 1023 cm\u22122. The more sensitive Chandra obser-\nvations of a smaller sample suggest that if submm galaxies\nhost AGN then these must be Compton-thick (N(Hi) \u226b\n1024 cm\u22122) and the amount of unreprocessed AGN emission\nwhich does escape by scattering must be small (Fabian et al.\n2000; Bautz et al. 2000; Hornschemeier et al. 2000; Almaini\net al. 2001).\nThus the available information suggests that the frac-\ntion of SCUBA galaxies which host optically-identifiable\nAGN is between 10 and 20 per cent (Barger et al. 1999a) and\nthat if AGN are present in the majority of the submm popu-\nlation then these must be sufficiently obscured that they are\nunlikely to be visible in the optical anyway. The low fraction\nof AGN-dominated systems is consistent with much more\ndetailed surveys of similar luminosity ULIRGs at z \u223c 0,\nwhich find 20\u201330 per cent are AGN-dominated (Genzel et\nal. 1998).\nBetter constraints on the proportion of AGN in the\nsubmm population await more sensitive hard X-ray observa-\ntions with XMM\/Newton (in blank fields) or Chandra (Al-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 21\nmaini et al. 2001), searches for broad emission lines in the\nless dust-sensitive near-IR wavebands and surveys for hot\ndust emission from AGN-illuminated tori in the mid-IR.\n6.5 Constraining the evolution of dusty galaxies\nFinally, we discuss the exploitation of the submm popula-\ntion for understanding the wider issue of the evolution of\ndusty galaxies. This section revisits the results of Blain et\nal. (1999b,1999c) to constrain simple models for the evolu-\ntion of luminous dusty galaxies and provide some physical\ninsights into the processes driving their activity.\nIn the local Universe, the luminosity function of lumi-\nnous dusty galaxies is best constrained at 60\u00b5m based on\nthe IRAS survey (Saunders et al. 1990). Additional informa-\ntion about these galaxies is also available at 100 \u00b5m (Soifer\n& Neugebauer 1990). These wavelengths are close to the\npeak of the SED for any reasonable dust temperature and\nthe ratio of the bright counts at 60 and 100\u00b5m implies a\nluminosity-averaged dust temperature Td \u223c 35\u201345k. 850-\n\u00b5m observations of galaxies detected by IRAS (Dunne et al.\n2000; Lisenfeld et al. 2000) provide a longer wavelength base-\nline and hence an excellent probe of the SED. These indicate\nTd = 36\u00b15k and a Rayleigh\u2013Jeans spectral index of 3.3\u00b10.2\n(i.e. \u03b2 = +1.3, but see Dunne & Eales 2001). The population\nof low-redshift dusty galaxies can be divided into relatively\nshort-lived warm interacting\/starbursting galaxies and long-\nlived cooler quiescent galaxies (Blain et al. 1999c; Barnard &\nBlain 2001); however, the details of this distinction are rel-\natively unimportant for studies of high-redshift galaxy evo-\nlution. Any low-luminosity, low-temperature dusty galaxies\nmissing from existing surveys do not contribute significantly\nto the luminosity density, even at low and moderate redshifts\n(Chapman et al. 2002).\nThe form of evolution of the baseline low-redshift far-\nIR luminosity function \u03a60(L) must be dominated by pure-\nluminosity evolution, that is \u03a6(L, z) \u2243 \u03a60[L\/g(z), 0], to\nensure that the far-IR background radiation intensity is\nnot exceeded. Number-density evolution is also likely to be\ninvolved, but must be dominated by luminosity evolution\n(Blain et al. 1999b; Chapman et al. 2001c). The evolution\nfunction g(z) is determined by demanding that the back-\nground radiation intensity, counts and redshift distributions\nof dusty galaxies are all in agreement with observations.\nThese observations are, in order of increasing redshift, the\nfaintest counts and redshift distributions of 60-\u00b5m IRAS\ngalaxies, deep 90- and 170-\u00b5m counts from ISO, the spec-\ntrum of background radiation from COBE, and the faint\ncounts and limited redshift information of distant galaxies\ndetected using SCUBA at 450 and 850\u00b5m and MAMBO at\n1.2mm.\nSeveral approaches can be taken to investigate the evo-\nlution. The simplest is to assume a parametric form for g(z)\nand fit this to the data to construct a model which relates\nobservations across a range of wavebands in a simple phe-\nnomenological manner (Blain et al. 1999b; see also Rowan-\nRobinson 2001). This has the advantage of requiring few\nparameters to model the galaxy SED so that the form of\nevolution can be well constrained using the sparse observa-\ntional information. A more physically motivated approach\nconnects the evolving mass function of galaxies to the as-\nsociated luminosity function using a prescription for both\nstar formation and the fueling of AGN (Baugh et al. 1998;\nGuiderdoni et al. 1998; Blain et al. 1999c); however, care\nmust be taken to avoid getting lost in the space of available\nfree parameters. Without an additional population of short-\nlived, very luminous galaxies, the simplest standard semi-\nanalytical models, which include star formation in the gas\nthat cools in galaxy disks, fail to account for the observed\nsurface density of SCUBA and MAMBO sources (Guider-\ndoni et al. 1998).\n6.5.1 A simple parametric model\nThis approach was adopted by Blain et al. (1999b), who as-\nsumed a local 60-\u00b5m luminosity function, an SED defined\nby a single dust temperature Td and a form of evolution\ng(z) = (1 + z)\u03b3 at low redshifts. Td and \u03b3 are determined\nfrom the 60-\u00b5m IRAS counts and the latest ISO counts at\n90- and 175\u00b5m (Juvela et al. 2000). We derive Td = 37\u00b13k\nand \u03b3 = 4.05 \u00b1 0.15, assuming a Rayleigh\u2013Jeans spectral\nindex of +3.5. These results differ only slightly from the\noriginal analysis of Blain et al. (1999b), based on more lim-\nited ISO data, Td = 38 \u00b1 4k and \u03b3 = 3.9 \u00b1 0.2. Equally,\nchanging to the more popular non-zero-\u039b cosmology does\nnot significantly alter this result (Blain 2001).\nThe characteristic dust temperature we derive is consis-\ntent with subsequent SCUBA measurements of local lumi-\nnous IRAS galaxies (Dunne et al. 2000), suggesting a conti-\nnuity in the properties of this population between low and\nmoderate redshifts. The value of \u03b3 we find is closer to that\nclaimed for the evolution of the optical luminosity density\n(Lilly et al. 1996) and mid-IR counts (Xu 2000) than the\nvalue of \u03b3 = 3 often assumed to describe the evolution of\ngalaxies in the far-IR waveband.\nAt higher redshifts, the behaviour is not well con-\nstrained by ISO observations (although future SIRTF sur-\nveys will make a major impact in this area) and we rely\ninstead on the form of the background radiation intensity\n(Fixsen et al. 1998) and the counts of SCUBA galaxies.\nThese are somewhat degenerate, although the SCUBA data\nprovide the better constraint. The most useful of the various\nsimple parametric forms adopted by Blain et al. (1999b) to\ndescribe the evolution of \u03a6 at high redshifts is the so-called\n\u2018Gaussian\u2019 model, in which g(z) at moderate and high red-\nshifts is represented by a Gaussian in cosmic epoch. Since\nthen, progress has been made in developing a more appro-\npriate form of g(z), which is fully compatible with models\nof cosmic chemical evolution and naturally includes a peak\nin the evolution function (Jameson 1999):\ng(z) = (1 + z)3\/2sech2[b ln(1 + z)\u2212 c] cosh2c. (1)\nAt low redshifts, \u03b3 \u2243 (3\/2) + 2b\n\u221a\n1\u2212 sech2c. Using all\navailable observational data, the results b = 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 and\nc = 1.84 \u00b1 0.1 are obtained; see the solid line in Fig. 12.\nThese results are similar to those derived by Blain et al.\n(1999b), but use the more accurate 175- and 850-\u00b5m counts\nnow available, as well as the limits on the probable redshift\ndistribution of the 850-\u00b5m population from \u00a74.6.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n22 Smail et al.\nFigure 12. The history of star formation inferred using the meth-\nods discussed in \u00a76.5. The thick solid line is derived using a simple\nparametric luminosity evolution model and the thick dashed line\nwith a hierarchical model. Both have been revised since Blain et\nal. (1999b, 1999c) were published, to reflect the increased amount\nof far-IR and submm data now available. The thin lines show\nthe envelope of 68-per-cent uncertainty for each of the two mod-\nels. The relative vertical normalisation of the curves depends on\nthe assumed IMF and the AGN fraction. The data points are\ninferred from UV\/optical\/near-IR observations, in order of in-\ncreasing redshift, by Gallego et al. (1996; filled triangle), Gron-\nwall (1999; thin diagonal cross), Treyer et al. (1998; open trian-\ngle), Tresse & Maddox (1998; empty circle), Lilly et al. (1996;\nfilled stars), Cowie, Songaila & Barger (1999; small filled circles),\nGlazebrook et al. (1999; bent square at z = 0.9), Connolly et al.\n(1997; filled squares), Moorwood et al. (2000, filled triangle), Yan\net al. (1999; empty lozenge), Madau et al. (1996; large filled cir-\ncles), and Pettini et al. (1998; empty squares). Flores et al. (1999;\nempty stars) and Pettini et al. (1998) have corrected the Lilly et\nal. and Madau et al. results respectively for observed dust extinc-\ntion. The high-redshift points are derived from analyses of the\nHDF. Wide-area ground-based surveys by Steidel et al. (1999)\nhave increased the estimated high-redshift SFR, as shown by the\nthick diagonal crosses. No extinction correction is applied to these\npoints; Steidel et al. (1999) estimate that the extinction-corrected\nSFR is greater by a factor of about 5; the effects are shown by the\nhigher pair of diagonal crosses. At longer wavelengths, SFRs have\nbeen derived from mid-IR observations by Flores et al. (1999) and\nin the submm by Hughes et al. (1998; empty circle with upward\npointing arrow). Based on radio observation, supplemented by\nredshift information provided by spectroscopic and photometric\nredshifts, Haarsma et al. (2000) infer star-formation rates shown\nby the thin solid crosses with no terminators. Based on a similar\ntechnique, supplemented further by submm observations, and in-\ncluding a completeness correction factor of 11, Barger, Cowie &\nRichards (2000) derive star-formation rates shown by the thick\nsolid crosses with terminators.\n6.5.2 A model of merging galaxies\nRather than use a purely parametric form for the evo-\nlution of \u03a6(L, z), an alternative approach is to adopt a\nmore physically-motivated model based upon the merger of\ndark matter halos in the Press\u2013Schecter formalism (Press\n& Schecter 1974). This implicitly assumes that the activity\nobserved in the far-IR is triggered through interactions and\nmergers (see \u00a76.1). We use a simple form of the evolution\nof the merger rate of dark-matter halos (Blain & Longair\n1993; Blain et al. 1999c), which adequately reproduces the\nresults of recent N-body simulations (Jenkins et al. 2001),\nand make the most basic assumption that a certain redshift-\ndependent fraction x(z) of the total mass of dark and bary-\nonic matter involved in these mergers is converted into en-\nergy by nucleosynthesis in high-mass stars with an efficiency\n0.007c2. The same formalism is appropriate for describing\nthe evolution of AGN fueling events at the epochs of merg-\ners (Blain et al. 1999c). The form of evolution and normal-\nization of x(z) can be determined in the same manner as\nfor the parametric model, using the background radiation\nintensity and low-redshift IRAS counts. Using an appropri-\nate form of x(z) = g(z)\/(1 + z)3\/2 (Jameson 1999), we find\nbest-fit parameters of b = 1.95 \u00b1 0.1, c = 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 and\nx(0) = 1.35 \u00d7 10\u22124 in our standard cosmology, assuming\nthe same galaxy SED used in the parametric model. How-\never, this model under-predicts the observed 175- and 850-\n\u00b5m counts by a large factor and so we are forced to introduce\nan additional parameter to allow the efficiency of merger-\ninduced bursts of activity to increase at high redshifts so\nas to reproduce these long-wavelength source counts. This\nadditional parameter is the product of the fraction F of\nmergers which generate luminous bursts and the duration\nof these bursts, \u03c3. The product F\u03c3(z) is included in our\nmodel and then constrained using all the available far-IR\ncounts, backgrounds and redshift distributions. Using the\nform F\u03c3(z) = F\u03c3(0) exp(az+ bz2+ cz3), we derive values of\nF\u03c3(0) = 2.4Gyr, a = \u22124.14, b = \u22120.56 and c = 0.46. The\nresulting history of galaxy evolution is shown by the thick\ndashed line in Fig. 12.\n6.5.3 The star-formation history\nBoth the parametric and hierarchical models account for\nall the observed background radiation, counts and redshift\ndistributions of galaxies at wavelengths longer than 60\u00b5m.\nAs shown by the comparison of the models with the opti-\ncal\/UV derived data points in Fig. 12, the dominant source\nof energy in the Universe is the rest-frame far-IR radia-\ntion of starlight and AGN emission which has been repro-\ncessed by dust. Indeed, apart from the relative normalisation\n(which can be varied by altering the assumed IMF and the\nfraction of AGN-powered activity), the parametric and hi-\nerarchical models in Fig. 12 show very similar behaviour.\nEqually the star-formation histories derived from deep ra-\ndio selected samples also show a comparable behaviour\n(Cram 1998; Barger, Cowie & Richards 2000; Haarsma et\nal. 2000; Chapman et al. 2001), which also tend to lie above\nthe optically-derived values, in broad agreement with the\ndust-enshrouded star-formation histories derived here (see\nFig. 12). Note that the results of Barger et al. (2000) do not\nclearly indicate a decline in the high-redshift evolution of\nthe star-formation rate.\nIn our hierarchical model, the strong increase in the far-\nIR luminosity density out to z \u223c 1\u20132 arises in part from the\nincreased rate of mergers in the early Universe. In addition,\nhowever, the ratio of the total amount of energy released\nduring mergers and the mass of dark matter involved must\nincrease sharply with redshift. This suggests that the pro-\ngenitors of the submm galaxies which dominate the far-IR\nemission at high redshifts must be more prone to massive\nstarbursts or AGN activity. This conclusion echoes the dis-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 23\ncussion of individual submm galaxies earlier in this section,\nwhere we find evidence that the typical separations between\nthe components in these massive, gas-rich mergers maybe\nlarger than has been claimed for similarly luminous galaxies\nlocally. This also hints at an increased instability in the pro-\ngenitor galaxies at high redshifts as the bolometric emission\nfrom massive, high-redshift mergers appears to peak earlier\nduring their interaction. Finally, we note that to avoid bias-\ning the redshift distribution of SCUBA-selected galaxies to\nvery high redshifts (Blain et al. 1999b) and to remain con-\nsistent with the spectral index of the mm-wave extragalactic\nbackground radiation (Gispert, Lagache & Puget 2000), the\ncomoving star-formation rate density in the obscured popu-\nlation must decline beyond z >\u223c 3\u20134.\nThe framework incorporated in our models can be ex-\ntended to include (or predict) observations in the radio and\nmid-IR regimes. For example, assuming the standard form\nof the far-IR\u2013radio correlation, with a radio spectral in-\ndex of \u22120.65, then the parametric and hierarchical mod-\nels predict source surface densities brighter than 10\u00b5Jy\nat 8.4GHz of 1.05 and 0.98 arcmin\u22122, with slopes of \u22121.4\nand \u22121.3 respectively, closely matching the observed count\nN(\u2265 S) = (1.01\u00b1 0.14)(S\/10\u00b5Jy)\u22121.25\u00b10.2 (Partridge et al.\n1997). Whereas, adopting a simple form for the mid-IR re-\ngion of our fiducial galaxy SED, F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd+\u03b1 with \u03b1 = \u22121.95\nat \u03bb <\u223c 60\u00b5m, then we reproduce the normalization and gen-\neral features of the deep 15-\u00b5m galaxy counts from ISOCAM\n(Elbaz et al. 1999), including the marked change of slope at\nflux densities between 0.5 and 1mJy. The predicted slope\nof the 15-\u00b5m counts at flux densities between 1 and 10mJy\nis steeper in the hierarchical model and provides slightly\nbetter agreement with the observations than the parametric\nscheme.\nFinally, we note one outstanding problem with the star-\nformation histories derived from the far-IR, first highlighted\nby Blain et al. (1999b). This is that the predicted mass frac-\ntion in stars, \u2126\u2217, at the present day, from these models,\nexceed the estimates of the observed stellar density by a\nfactor of about five, based on a large near-IR-selected red-\nshift survey by Cole et al. (2001). One possible explanation\nfor this discrepency is that a large fraction of the luminos-\nity of distant dusty galaxies could be produced by AGN\nrather than by high-mass stars. However, the current es-\ntimates of the fraction of AGN-dominated submm sources\npresented in \u00a76.4 suggest this is not likely (although this ob-\nviously requires confirmation, e.g. Ivison et al. 1998, 2000a;\nAlmaini et al. 2001). This indicates, therefore, that if the\nbackground radiation intensity and counts determined in the\nsubmm waveband are not significantly in error then either a\nlarger fraction of the baryons in the Universe has been pro-\ncessed into stars than is estimated from local galaxy surveys\nor, more likely, the process of star formation in the submm\npopulation must differ from that in nearby \u2018normal\u2019 galax-\nies, with an initial IMF biased to high-mass stars (more akin\nto the that seen in 30 Doradus, Sirianni et al. 2001). Blain et\nal. (1999b) estimated that a lower mass limit of about 1M\u2299\nis required in the IMF in the submm galaxies to comply with\nthe local stellar mass fraction, although higher mass cutoffs\nare also feasible.\n7 DISCUSSION\nThere are several questions about the submm population\nwhich need to be urgently addressed. These concern the na-\nture of the galaxies selected in the submm, their redshifts,\nmasses and power sources, as well as more general issues of\ntheir relation to other classes of high-redshift sources, such\nas LBGs, radio galaxies and QSOs.\nAs this paper has demonstrated, we are still at a rela-\ntively early stage in our understanding of the mJy submm\npopulation. In part, this is because they were only discov-\nered four years ago. However, as we have stressed here, the\nmain barrier to improving our knowledge of this population\nis the lack of bright optical (or even near-IR) counterparts\nfor the bulk of the submm galaxies found to date. As a re-\nsult, we are left with relatively little evidence to sift when\ntrying to understand the nature and evolution of this pop-\nulation and must fall back on circumstantial evidence and\nsome degree of conjecture when attempting to place these\ngalaxies within their correct cosmological context.\nIntegrating the deepest submm counts, we have shown\nthat the submm galaxies lying in the decade of flux brighter\nthan about 1mJy produce about 60 per cent of the far-IR\nbackground at 850\u00b5m (see also Hughes et al. 1998; Eales\net al. 1999) and probably closer to 80 per cent by 0.5mJy.\nTaken in combination with the fact that over half the energy\ndensity in the extragalactic background is contained in the\nfar-IR and submm wavebands, it is clear that this popula-\ntion is important for understanding the energetics of galaxy\nformation and evolution.\nThe weight of evidence on the distances to these galax-\nies, from optical and near-IR spectroscopy and crude limits\nbased on far-IR and radio colours, appears to point to the\nbulk of this population lying at high redshifts, z > 2. This\nconfirms that for any reasonable characteristic dust temper-\nature these dusty galaxies must have high bolometric lumi-\nnosities, >\u223c 10\n12 L\u2299, and thus classifies them as ULIRGs. The\nimportance of this population at high redshifts is in stark\ncontrast with its negligible contribution to their luminosity\ndensity at z = 0. Thus we must be seeing rapid evolution in\nthese highly luminous systems.\nOn the question of what powers the immense luminosi-\nties of the submm population, again the balance of evidence\nis that majority of the population do not appear to host\nunobscured, or partially-obscured, AGN (e.g. Almaini et al.\n2001), similar to the proportion of AGN-dominated ULIRGs\nseen locally (Genzel et al. 1998). Even in the few examples\nwhich do show clear signatures of non-thermal emission it\nappears that star formation still contributes a large fraction\nof the total bolometric output (Frayer et al. 1998; Bautz et\nal. 2000).\nThis then leaves us with massive star formation as the\nmost likely mechanism to power these sources. The SFR\nrequired to produce LFIR \u223c 1012 L\u2299 corresponds to a for-\nmation rate of O, B and A stars of about 210M\u2299 yr\n\u22121 (or an\nupper limit of 650M\u2299 yr\n\u22121, based on an extrapolation us-\ning a Salpeter IMF extending from 0.1 to 100M\u2299, Thronson\n& Telesco 1986). These estimates are consistent with other\nmeasures of the SFR available for a handful of the submm\npopulation (Ivison et al. 2000a) and are sufficient to form\nan L\u2217-galaxy in only a few 100Myr.\nNext, we address the question of the relationship be-\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n24 Smail et al.\ntween the submm galaxies and other classes of high-redshift\nsources and the information these provide about galaxy for-\nmation as traced by the star-formation history of the Uni-\nverse.\nIn a recent paper, Adelberger & Steidel (2000, AS) pre-\nsented a useful analysis of the properties that submm galax-\nies would be expected assuming that they can be described\nby an extrapolation of the behaviour of the populations se-\nlected in the rest-frame UV. Based upon the rest-frame UV\nemission (observed R\/I bands) and a model of the correla-\ntion between UV spectral slope and far-IR emission for local\nUV-detected starbursts, AS predict that the median magni-\ntude of the counterparts to the 850-\u00b5m sources in our survey\nshould be I \u223c 24. However, as Table 4 shows, the lensing-\ncorrected median apparent magnitude for our sample is ac-\ntually I \u2265 26, and may be considerably fainter as most of\nthe sources remain undetected in I , even though some are\nseen in the K-band. This indicates that the UV\/far-IR ra-\ntio of these submm-selected galaxies is roughly an order of\nmagnitude lower than expected from AS\u2019s model.\nIndeed, recent work by van der Werf et al. (2001a),\nBaker et al. (2001), Sanders (2001) and Meurer & Seibert\n(2001) has shown that the extrapolation used by AS is not\nfollowed by bolometrically-selected samples of very luminous\nlocal and distant galaxies. Hence, the basic assumption of\nAS\u2019s analysis \u2013 that the SFRs of luminous submm galaxies\ncan be predicted reliably from their rest-frame UV emission\n\u2013 is unfounded (also see Chapman et al. 2000; Peacock et al.\n2000). Moreover, given their extreme faintness in the opti-\ncal, a large proportion of the submm galaxies are completely\nmissed by UV-selected surveys of the distant Universe. Ob-\nviously any attempt to apply a correction factor for the star\nformation density missed in this population cannot rely on\ntheir (unmeasurable) UV spectral slopes. As a result, such\nsurveys provide a lower limit to, but a potentially seriously\nincomplete measure of, the total star formation rate at high\nredshifts (Hughes et al. 1998).\nIf we assume instead that the bulk of the star formation\ntraced by the submm population is completely missed in the\nUV, we must add their contribution to UV-based estimates\nto obtain the total star-formation density. Unfortunately, we\nstill lack detailed information about the properties of the\nmajority of submm galaxies (most crucially redshifts) and\nfor this reason we therefore follow the approach of Blain et\nal. (1999b, 1999c) and use two simple evolutionary models to\nderive the history of star-formation activity using all avail-\nable far-IR and submm background and count data. First,\na model of pure-luminosity evolution of the low-redshift 60-\n\u00b5m IRAS luminosity function as described in detail by Blain\net al. (1999b); second, a model of galaxy formation by hi-\nerarchical clustering, in which powerful episodes of dust-\nenshrouded luminosity are triggered by major mergers, as\ndescribed by Blain et al. (1999c). The results of both mod-\nels have been updated to include count and redshift data\nthat was unavailable when these works were published, as\ndescribed in \u00a76.5, are shown in Fig. 12.\nSubject to systematic uncertainties in the IMF (\u00a76.5.3),\nand the fraction of energy released in dust-enshrouded galax-\nies due to AGN accretion as compared with high-mass\nstar-formation activity, the total amount of star-formation\nin dust-enshrouded galaxies appears to exceed that within\noptical- and near-IR-selected galaxies at high redshift by a\nfactor of several (Fig. 12). Even after correcting the model\nresults, assuming that at most 20 per cent of the emission\ncomes from purely gravitationally-powered emission from\nAGN (\u00a76.4; Almaini et al. 1999, 2001), the obscured activity\nin the far-IR selected galaxy population will still dominate\nthe budget of massive star formation at z \u223c 2\u20133 (Hughes et\nal. 1998). The properties of these galaxies are thus central\nto our understanding of the formation of massive stars and\nmetals in the high-redshift Universe.\nThe classes of distant galaxies selected through submm\nand UV techniques clearly have very different properties and\nrepresent relatively independent subsets of the high-redshift\ngalaxy population, except for rare composite systems such\nas SMMJ14011+0252. What is the physical basis for these\ndifferences? Do the submm galaxies represent the most mas-\nsive members of the galaxy population as a whole, or do they\nrepresent a particular evolutionary phase (Shu et al. 2001;\nFardal et al. 2001; Granato et al. 2001)?\nThe dynamical information available for several Class-\nII submm galaxies shows them to be massive systems,\n>\u223c 10\n11 M\u2299 within 20 kpc. This is nearly an order of mag-\nnitude more massive than typical UV-selected galaxies at\nz > 2 which have a comparable volume density (Pettini et\nal. 1998; Moorwood et al. 2000; Kobulnicky & Koo 2001),\nalthough a small proportion of equally massive LBGs are\nknown (e.g. Pettini et al. 1998, 2001). The rest-frame opti-\ncal sizes of the Class-II submm galaxies also appear to be\nlarger than is typically found for UV-selected sources (com-\npare the results in Ivison et al. 2000a and Dickinson 2000)\nwith several showing merger-like morphologies.\nThus, while there is some evidence to suggest that the\nsubmm galaxies have more massive progenitors than the typ-\nical LBGs (see also Shu et al. 2001), we are more inclined\nto believe that they represent a particular phase in the evo-\nlution of massive galaxies at high redshifts, rather than a\ncompletely separate population.\nThe Class-II submm galaxies are optically luminous and\nyet gas-rich, indicating that they possess both a significant\nmass of existing stars, and a substantial reservoir of fuel for\nthe formation of additional stellar populations. This sug-\ngests that the present-day descendents of these galaxies will\nbe some of the most massive stellar systems in the local Uni-\nverse. It is the properties of these Class-II galaxies which are\nat the heart of the argument that submm galaxies evolve\ninto the most luminous and massive spheroids (>\u223c L\n\u2217) at\nthe present day. The merger-like morphologies of some of\nthese galaxies is further evidence for their role in forming\nthe most massive local ellipticals. Support for this argument\nfor the general submm population is entirely circumstantial:\ntheir strong clustering (Ivison et al. 2000b; Almaini et al.\n2001) and equivalent space density to local luminous ellipti-\ncals (Lilly et al. 1999). However, to construct a more direct\nevolutionary connection will require kinematically-selected\nsamples of high-redshift galaxies, and as such will be obser-\nvationally demanding.\nFurther depletion of the gas reservoir in the Class-II\ngalaxies and the destruction of obscuring dust by intense\nradiation fields would naturally result in them evolving into\nmassive examples of LBGs, QSO host galaxies or luminous\nradio galaxies (Dunlop 2001; Granato et al. 2001). If the\nClass-II sources represent the most evolved submm galax-\nies, then the pressing question is the relationship between\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe nature of faint submm-selected galaxies 25\nthese and the majority of the submm population, which fall\ninto Class 0\/I. Do these optically-fainter systems represent\neither higher redshift systems, or an earlier phase in the\ngrowth of the Class-II galaxies, i.e. does the Class 0\u2013II clas-\nsification scheme have an evolutionary basis akin to that for\nprotostars, or are Class 0\/I galaxies simply their less massive\ncousins, or intrinsically more obscured?\nOur sample shows slight differences between Class-0\/I\nand Class-II sources, with the suggestion that the former\nare typically fainter in the submm and exhibit higher radio\u2013\nsubmm indices, \u03b18501.4 . The simplest interpretations are that\nthe Class-0\/I sources include some galaxies that either are\nmore obscured, or have intrinsically colder dust, or lie at\nhigher redshifts than the Class-II sources. We note that the\nmedian redshift of the Class-II galaxies is <z>= 1.9 \u00b1 0.6,\ncompared to the estimate of <z>= 2.8+2.1\u22121.2 from the radio\u2013\nsubmm index-based estimates for the Class-0\/I sources. This\nhints that at least some of the Class-0\/I galaxies may be at\nhigh redshifts, z >\u223c 3, where K-corrections would dim their\nnear-IR counterparts significantly (Fig. 8; Dey et al. 1999).\nHowever, the current sample is too small and the uncertain-\nties too large to clearly show any differences between the\nclasses or definitively state the reasons for these.\n8 CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, the bulk of the background radiation inten-\nsity has been resolved into discrete submm sources using\nSCUBA at an 850-\u00b5m intrinsic flux limit of \u223c 1mJy. The\ncounterparts to these submm sources appear to be dusty, ul-\ntraluminous galaxies with very diverse optical and near-IR\nproperties. The majority of these galaxies appear to lie at\nz >\u223c 1, with a median redshift of z \u223c 2.5\u20133.\nThe optically brighter sources have been studied in\nmore detail using mm-wave interferometers, and they show\nthe large dynamical masses and high gas fractions expected\nfor young massive galaxies. The characteristics of these\ngalaxies are consistent with them being the progenitors of\nthe most massive elliptical galaxies seen in the local Uni-\nverse. A comparison of the detailed properties of a handful\nof these galaxies with local ULIRGs suggests that the rapid\nincrease in dust-obscured activity at high redshifts, need to\nexplain the submm counts and the FIRB, has its origin in\nthe increasing instability of the gas-rich, bulge-weak progen-\nitors of the submm population at high redshifts. However,\nthe majority of the mJy submm population remain elusive;\nthey have very faint (or invisible) counterparts in the optical\nand near-IR and progress in investigating their nature and\nproperties is likely to be slow.\nIn the future we look forward to increases in the number\nof submm galaxies with accurate redshift determinations \u2013\ncrucial for follow-up CO line-mapping to provide dynami-\ncal masses and gas fractions. Work in this area will require\ndeep spectroscopy in the near-IR (and optical) on 10-m class\ntelescopes for the brighter Class-I and II sources, as well as\nmore innovative approaches, such as blind radio searches for\nOH\/H2O maser emission (Townsend et al. 2001). Improved\nconstraints on the redshift distribution of the whole submm\npopulation await the confirmation of the radio-submm spec-\ntral index (and more detailed SED fitting) as a reliable es-\ntimator of redshift for submm-selected galaxies. In part this\nwill rely on checking at higher luminosities and redshifts,\nusing SIRTF and SOFIA, the relatively weak dependence of\ndust temperature on luminosity seen in low-redshift IRAS-\nselected galaxies by Dunne et al. (2000).\nEqually essential is the detailed study of the charac-\nteristics of individual sources. Here the main advances are\nlikely to come from observations across a wide range of wave-\nlength, with the X-ray, mid-IR and far-IR wavebands be-\ning the most promising, providing crucial information about\nthe distribution of dust temperatures and the power sources\ndriving these systems. Observations at higher spatial resolu-\ntion, in the near-IR, mm and radio wavebands, will allow us\nto study the internal structure of these galaxies \u2013 to search\nfor morphological evidence of the events which triggered\ntheir prodigous activity. In particular, the refurbishment of\nNICMOS on-board HST will provide a powerful tool to in-\nterpret the rest-frame optical morphologies of these galaxies\nand compare them to local ULIRGs to test if the same phys-\nical processes are responsible for ultraluminous systems at\nlow and high redshifts. In the longer term, the direct study\nof the detailed astrophysics of submm galaxies will benefit\nimmensely from the sensitivity and resolving power of the\n10-milliarcsec resolution ALMA interferometer array.\nWe expect that submm surveys which exploit lens am-\nplification, such as the one presented here, will retain a cen-\ntral role in studying the submm galaxy population. In part\nthis is because the properties of these galaxies tax the capa-\nbilities of current instrumentation in many wavebands and\nhence the boost provided by the lens is essential for suc-\ncessful follow-up. Moreover, observations through massive\ngravitational lenses allow us to probe intrinsically fainter\nsubmm sources, which are more representative of the popu-\nlation responsible for the bulk of the FIRB. We look forward\nto continued exploitation of the sample presented here, and\nthe results of new surveys, to study the nature of the faint\nsubmm population and answer some of the questions raised\nin this paper.\nFinally, the goal of future theoretical work in this area\nshould be to incorporate both the obscured submm popula-\ntion (Class 0 and I) and the less-obscured systems (Class-II\nsubmm galaxies and the more massive classical LBGs) into\na single evolutionary sequence and hence naturally explain\nthe relation between the two populations. Important obser-\nvational input on this question can be obtained by studying\nthe relative clustering of the various populations in well-\ndefined environments at high redshifts, in particular the\noverdense regions around some luminous radio galaxies (Ivi-\nson et al. 2000b) may evolve into the cores of massive clus-\nters at the present day. Such studies will require wide-field\nsurveys covering the UV, near-IR and longer wavelengths,\nthe new SCUBA2 submm camera for the JCMT and the\nWFCAM panoramic near-IR camera for UKIRT will be a\npowerful facilities for obtaining the essential observations in\nthese wavebands.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Amy Barger, Len Cowie, Alastair\nEdge, Dave Frayer, Katherine Gunn, Frazer Owen and Ian\nRobson for help in undertaking this project.
