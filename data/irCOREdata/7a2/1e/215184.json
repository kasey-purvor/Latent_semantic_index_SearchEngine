Currently, the world\u2019s largest carbon \nmarket is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which covers over 40% of EU carbon \ndioxide emissions, or about 2 GtCO2.  But the proposals currently contemplated by US \nlawmakers would create a US-wide carbon market which would be two or three times bigger \nthan the EU ETS. Carbon trading is also contemplated in Australia, New Zealand and \u2013 more \ncautiously \u2013 in Japan, Canada and emerging markets like Mexico. Meanwhile, the expansion \nand reform of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) \u2014 the world\u2019s largest baseline-and-\ncredit system \u2014 is a key aspect of the international negotiations for a new international \nagreement post-21012. Various other options to support carbon finance flows from \ndeveloped to developing countries are being actively discussed, including sectoral crediting \nmechanisms which would deliver credits for emission reductions from entire sectors, along \nwith ironing out the wrinkles in programmatic CDM which would permit credits to be granted \nfor programmes that aggregate many small emission reducing activities, and so on (Vivid \nEconomics, 2008; Michaelowa et al., 2008). \nAs the world embarks on expanding the coverage of carbon markets globally, this is a good \nmoment to recap the economic case for carbon trading and review market design options.  \nThis paper is part of a twin set of papers addressing what a global carbon market might look \nlike by around 2030, assessing design features relevant to both space (this paper) and time \n(the companion paper). \nBehind the expansion of carbon markets is the recognition that any meaningful climate \nchange policy has to put a price on carbon (Stern 2007), which ideally would eventually be \nroughly equivalent across nations.  This is a fundamental, if fairly basic, lesson from \nenvironmental economics and the theory of externalities (Baumol and Oates, 1988; Cropper \nand Oates, 1992).  Environmental economics also tells us that there are several ways of \nputting a price on carbon, including taxes, permits and any number of hybrid instruments.  \nDifferent national jurisdictions may adopt different approaches, but what matters is that \ngreenhouse gas emissions are priced to reflect their marginal social costs. \nUnder idealised textbook assumptions, carbon trading and carbon taxes (and hybrids of the \ntwo) are essentially equivalent, but in real world situations with imperfect information, \ntransaction costs and external shocks, there are important differences (Hepburn, 2006).1 The \n                                                          \n1\n The key reference on taxes versus permits remains Weitzman (1974).  Hoel and Karp (2001) and \nNewell and Pizer (2003) have extended the Weitzman result to stock pollutants such as CO2, where \n  Carbon markets in space \n3 \npolicy preference for carbon trading over carbon taxes in recent years is not driven by these \neconomic differences, however, but by political economy considerations. Trading systems are \neasier to implement politically (Hepburn, 2006, 2007). \nThe choice between taxes and permits (or allowance-based systems) is not strict, and hybrid \ninstruments that blend price-based and quantity-based features, are discussed in the \ncompanion paper (Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010). For instance, the slope of the supply curve \nof an allowance to emit is an issue of policy design. It is only one of many design choices \npolicy makers have to make, of course.   In designing a carbon market, other policy issues \ninclude: \n\uf0be The allocation of allowances creates economic rents and therefore matters \nenormously to the political viability of any system (Fischer et al. 1998, Bucher et al. \n2007).  In many cases allocation may also influence the efficiency of the system \n(Stavins, 1995; Hepburn et al., 2006) \n\uf0be The interaction of carbon markets with other instruments is critical for climate \npolicy, because carbon markets will be supplemented by other instruments.  While \nthe simple theory of externalities indicates that only one instrument is needed to \ninternalise one externality, in the climate change context several exernalities in \naddition to the greenhouse gas externality are relevant, including externalities \nrelating to innovation and R&D.  These other externalities may be addressed \nthrough separate policy levers that supplement a price of carbon.  In addition, \npolitical distortions are likely to imply that attempts to internalise the carbon price \nare suboptimal, such that carbon prices are well-below the social cost of emissions, \nsupporting the case for supplementary interventions to increase coverage or to lift \nlong-term prices.  \n\uf0be Transaction costs matter with regard to design choice. Some systems are easier to \nadminister than others. For instance, upstream trading systems have fewer (and \nmore sophisticated) trading entities than, say, downstream trading between \nindividual consumers. Another example is that baseline and credit systems, such as \nthe Clean Development Mechanism, have inherently higher transaction costs than \ncap and trade systems, because asymmetric information requires costly signalling to \nprove additionality (Vivid Economics, 2008).  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                        \ndamage does not depend on the flow of emissions but on their accumulation in the atmosphere.   \n \n  Carbon markets in space \n4 \nIt is not the purpose of this paper to deal with all of the issues above.  Rather we focus on a \nkey issue that makes carbon markets a cost-effective instrument for emission control:  the \nflexibility to spread emission reductions across space.  \nIt is this \u201cwhere flexibility\u201d that allows markets to minimise compliance costs.  In principle, the \nmore \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility is built into market design, the more cost-effective a market is likely \nto be.  However, there are factors that may counsel against full liberalisation of markets \nacross space.  For example, different levels of ambition in different jurisdictions may prevent \nthe linking of regional markets. The complement to flexibility across space, and equally \nimportant, is flexibility to spread emissions across time - or \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility. We consider \nquestion of temporal design in the companion paper (Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010). \nAn important issue considered by this paper and the companion paper is volatility in the \ncarbon price, which is a relevant factor in determining the ease with which large-scale \nprojects to reduce emissions can be financed using incentives created by carbon markets. \nUndue price fluctuations have been an important concern of policy makers, both upward (e.g. \nthe call for safety valves in the US and Australian discussion) and downward (for example the \nrecent drop in EU allowance prices and the price collapse in phase I).  Linking markets is one \nway of reducing regulatory-induced volatility, as price volatility and market flexibility are \nlinked.  The more integrated a market is across space (and time), the less volatile prices \nshould be, all else being equal.  With deeper markets, a shock to any one region will have a \nsmaller impact on the global carbon price than it would have had on a regional carbon price \nin an autarkic, smaller market.  While linking to other regions also creates exposure to shocks \nin those other regions, overall market integration might be expected to reduce price volatility \n(Jacks et al., 2009).  In fact, in some cases price volatility is a direct consequence of market \ndesign and\/or policy shocks, rather than being caused by natural market fluctuations. \nThe structure of this paper is as follows.  Section 2 sets out some \u201cfirst principles\u201d of design \u2013 \nwith a focus on \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility \u2013 that underpin the rest of the paper.  Our focus is on firm-\nlevel trading systems, although much of what we say would also apply to government-level \ntrading (e.g., AAU trading under the Kyoto Protocol). Section 3 examines the key design issues \nin linking national and regional carbon markets together to create a global carbon market. \nSection 4 concludes.  \n  Carbon markets in space \n5 \n2 First principles of carbon market design \u2013 \nspatial issues \nThe cost-effectiveness of our efforts to reduce emissions will be critical to the success or \nfailure of climate policy, for two reasons.  First, the world\u2019s willingness to pay is limited; there \nare always many worthy claims to attention and funds.  As such, achieving stabilisation of \natmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at 450-550 ppm will require that the available \nfunds are spent wisely.  Second, climate change is a significant global challenge because: (i) \nthe costs of reducing emissions are expected to be substantial \u2013 at least 1% of GDP (Stern, \n2007; IEA 2007) 2; and (ii) those costs are a strong function of policy choices.  It is thus \nextremely important that the world tackles mitigation in a cost-effective way. \nCosts are reduced by allowing flexibility about where (and also when) emissions reductions \noccur.  Integrated assessment modellers have long recognised this.  For instance, in 1996 the \nStanford Energy Modeling Forum noted that the cost of the then Berlin Mandate (the process \nthat resulted in the Kyoto Protocol) could be reduced to a fraction of the total by introducing \nspatial and temporal flexibility (Richels et al. 1996; Manne and Richels, 1996; see Figure 1).  \nThis conclusion has proven robust to specific models and particular policies (e.g. Vrolijk and \nGrubb, 1999), as indeed would be expected.  A recent example is the work by Edmonds et al. \n(2008) on the cost of delaying developing country participation in the global deal.  Indeed, \nunder certain plausible conditions it is theoretically inevitable that providing more options \nreduces costs.3  \nThis insight on the value of \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility is significant.  It suggests that, ceteris parabus, \nour ambition should be a \u201cglobal\u201d carbon market.  In practice, there are various caveats and \nconstraints on implementing such a market.  Nevertheless, something approximating a global \ncarbon market might be created by \u201clinking\u201d different national and regional trading systems.  \nLinking markets not only increases \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility, it also increases liquidity, because there \nare more willing buyers and sellers, which reduces the costs of trading.  In contrast, \nfragmented and unconnected national carbon trading systems would be less liquid, or \n\u201cthinner\u201d, with concomitantly higher costs of reducing emissions.4  \n                                                          \n2\n Of course, it is expected that these costs will be hugely outweighed by the benefits from mitigating \nclimate change (Stern, 2007). \n3\n For a study of the relationship between choice and welfare, see Irons and Hepburn (2007).  \n4\n The new Carbon Reduction Commitment in the United Kingdom may suffer from problems of limited \n  Carbon markets in space \n6 \n \nFigure 1 Cost reductions from allowing \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility  \n \nSource: Richels et al (1996) \n Political and economic constraints will likely prevent a perfectly global carbon market from \nemerging. But some of these constraints are not particular to carbon markets.  For instance, \nthe \u201cglobal markets\u201d for oil, wheat and gold are in fact complex trading systems where \nlocation, quality and time matter. Carbon will most likely be the same, and it would be \nsurprising if there were a single, globally uniform carbon price. \nIn particular, there may be constraints in linking up systems because of (Flachsland et al. \n2009):5 \n(i) inherent differences in the traded good.  For instance, \u201cforest carbon\u201d from \nafforestation or reforestation schemes raises questions of permanence (Eliasch \n2008).   Aviation emissions involve complex scientific issues of radiative forcing at \naltitude, and various other sectors, including agriculture for instance, involve the \nconversion of other greenhouse gases into carbon dioxide equivalents; \n(ii) excessive cost differences.  While the point of emissions trading is to maximise \n\u201cgains from trade\u201d (section 3.1), political considerations demand that transfers are \nnot \u201ctoo large\u201d.  For instance, one of the controversies surrounding HFC projects \nunder the CDM was the amount of economic rent generated (Wara 2007, Hepburn, \n                                                                                                                                                                        \nliquidity (Defra, 2008). \n5\n  Jotzo and Betz (2009), Sterk and Kruger (2009) and Tuerk et al (2009) analyse concrete impediments \nto linking in from specific cap-and-trade proposals.  \n  Carbon markets in space \n7 \n2007).  Rightly or wrongly, the carbon market was seen as too expensive a way to \nphase out HFCs, compared to regulation, given the marginal costs of abatement \nwere in principle extremely low; and   \n(iii) policy differences, primarily due to differences in the level of ambition of different \nsystems. Differences in ambition manifest themselves in different carbon price \nlevels that are deemed unacceptable. \n \nNext we turn to design features that can overcome some of these limitations to \u201cwhere\u201d \nflexibility. \n  Carbon markets in space \n8 \n3 Spatial design options \nThe first principles of carbon market design point to a theoretical ideal of a global market \nwith full \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility.  Given the geographical distribution of low-cost mitigation \nopportunities (McKinsey 2009), only a global market will ensure full cost-efficiency.  \nA truly global carbon market with uniform rules and a global regulatory regime is unlikely to \nemerge for many years. However, a system of connected and coordinated regional markets \ncan be an alternative that provides similar efficiency gains. Even established global markets \nlike that for oil, wheat or coal are systems of separate but highly integrated regional markets \nwith distinct local supply and demand dynamics.  The most likely way in which a global carbon \nmarket will emerge is through increasingly closer links between regional trading systems. \nLinked markets will create trading opportunities, financial flows and \u201crents\u201d, or gains from \ntrade (section 3.1). Linking regional markets requires a certain level of coordination and the \nalignment of policy objectives between the systems. Perhaps the most important objective \nupon which agreement is required is the range of acceptable carbon prices, as prices in linked \nsystems will invariably converge through arbitrage. That is, there has to be an equivalence of \nambition between systems (section 3.2).  There is also a need for coordination on market \nrules such as allowance allocation, the treatment of offsets and quality standards, e.g. in \nterms of monitoring (section 3.3).  The more integrated a market is, the lower are concerns \nabout carbon leakage and the loss of competitiveness. If markets are insufficiently linked or \n\u201cunilateral\u201d, a key concern for market design is how to address leakage and competitiveness \nissues (section 3.4). \n3.1 The gains from trade \nA key feature of integrated markets \u2013 and in fact the source of the efficiency gains \u2013 is that it \nallows the arbitrage of price differentials until there is a uniform price across the system. \nFigure 2 shows this effect schematically. Emission reductions in the first country (in our \nhypothetical example, the US) are measured from left to right, those of the second country \n(the EU) are measured from right to left.  The width of the graph denotes the combined \nabatement effort.  Before markets are linked, different autarky prices prevail in each system.  \nOnce the two markets are linked we will observe a net flow of allowances from the low-price \nsystem (the US in this example) to the high-price system (the EU) until there is a uniform \nprice.  Higher marginal abatement costs in the EU means that EU firms find it optimal to \npurchase allowances from US firms instead of reducing emissions at home. \n  Carbon markets in space \n9 \nFigure 2 Hypothetical gains from linking US and EU trading systems  \n \n \nThe activity generates economic benefits in the size of the shaded area:  High-cost abatement \nin the EU is replaced with cheaper abatement in the US.  At the firm level, EU firms benefit \nfrom reduced costs of compliance, and US firms profit from selling their excess allowances at \nhigher prices than they would achieve in the domestic US system.  The size of the gains from \ntrade depends upon the shape of the marginal abatement cost curves of the trading regions, \nand the respective ambition of the two systems.   \nIn the unlikely even that the linking systems are identical in ambition, such that carbon prices \nare identical in autarky, then there are no immediate gains from trade.  However, even in \nsuch a case there are benefits from increased liquidity.  Furthermore, Figure 2 only presents a \nstatic analysis; in reality the location of the marginal abatement costs will shift as new \ntechnologies are discovered, and indeed as the market price of other key commodities (such \nas coal and gas) move.  These dynamic movements imply that even systems of roughly \nequivalent ambition would have wide discrepancies in prices unless they were linked \ntogether.  \n3.2 Equivalence of ambition \nBecause linking equalises carbon prices, a precondition for linking markets is that policy \nmakers in both systems have similar levels of \u201cambition\u201d, or expectations about the carbon \nprice.  The equilibrium price Pworld in Figure 2 has to be within an acceptable range for both \njurisdictions.  \n  Carbon markets in space \n10 \nThis seems obvious but is in fact the main stumbling block in linking up markets.  European \npolicy makers more or less explicitly aspire to a high-price system that ultimately supports \ntechnologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (e.g., UK Committee on Climate Change 2009). \nIn much of the rest of the world, most notably the US, the concern is more about avoiding \nprice spikes. As long as levels of ambition are not aligned regional markets will not be linked \nfor political reasons, and if they were linked they create political problems and would \nfunction badly. \nImagine a linked up system such as that in Figure 2 where regulators in both systems have the \nability to intervene in the market.  The following undesirable scenario could occur.  In the \nlow-price system, a safety valve or other mechanism might be triggered as arbitrage pushes \nthe price up to the equilibrium level (for example, through the issuance of additional \nallowances or increased offset limits). In the meantime, the high-price regulator might seek to \nsupport the price by withdrawing allowances or imposing an auction reserve price above \nPworld. The two sets of action will cancel each other out (unless one regulator has more market \npower than the other). In the process they will increase the flow of allowances from the low-\nprice to the high-price system.  Market intervention exacerbates the ex-ante differences.  The \nlow-price system becomes even more low-price (in terms of the autarky price) as the level of \nambition is scaled down, and the reverse happens in the high-price system. \nA second issue is the acceptance of the financial transfers and trade flows that integration will \nbring. They are depicted graphically in Figure 3. The low-cost system (in our example, the US) \ncan expect carbon market revenues from the high-cost system (in our example, the EU) in the \nmagnitude of the shaded rectangle. Depending on the shape of the abatement cost curves \nand the levels of domestic ambition, cross-border flows may be significant relative to overall \ntrading volumes. For example, in 2008 UK firms participating in the EU ETS were 24% over \ntheir allowed cap and had to buy a net 50 million allowances from firms in other countries.  \nGerman firms were 21% short and had to import 84 million allowances. 6 Combined, these \ntransactions were worth in excess of \u20ac2.5 billion.   \nThis is a small sum relative to overall trade flows. The UK imports goods and services worth \nover \u20ac500 billion each year. Nevertheless, the size and direction of trade flows is likely to \nmatter when systems are linked up, and particularly when they are caused by differences in \nthe level of ambition (a policy choice), rather than abatement costs (a technical-economic \n                                                          \n6\n Data from http:\/\/communities.thomsonreuters.com\/Carbon\/. A fraction of the shortfall may also \nhave been borrowed from the 2009 allowance pool (see section 4.1). \n  Carbon markets in space \n11 \nissue).  Few policy makers will be willing to reward low levels of ambition in other countries \nwith additional financial flows from carbon market arbitrage. \nA likely compromise that is more palatable politically, at least in the short-term, may be \nindirect linking. This can be achieved if two parallel trading systems are linked to a third \nmarket. The most likely conduit is the international offset market, that is the CDM or \neventually a more broader sector crediting scheme (Lazerowicz 2009). \nFigure 3 Hypothetical payments from EU firms to US firms \n \n \n3.3 Compatibility of system design \nLinking trading systems requires a minimum level of coordination on market design or the \ncombined markets will not function properly.  We have already seen the impact of differing \nprice policies (price support vs. safety valves) in the previous section.  It is not the only area \nwhere coordination will be necessary (Sterk et al., 2009). \nOne major area where consistency across systems is crucial in the longer term is allowance \nallocation.  In isolated markets (and in the early stages of a system) allowances tend to be \nissued for free, particularly to installations that are subject to international competition.  The \nbelief is that this can help to mitigate negative impacts on competitiveness.  We will discuss \nthe merits of this approach in the next section.  Whatever they may be, they fall away once \nthe competition is also capped under a linked emissions trading system and therefore subject \nto the same carbon price.  In that case free allocation becomes a form of state aid that gives \nits recipients a competitive advantage over rivals that have to purchase their allowances.  To \n  Carbon markets in space \n12 \navoid market distortions, linking up regional systems has to go hand-in-hand with an \nalignment in allocation rules. \nThis is the reason why allocation rules within the EU ETS are coordinated at EU rather than \nnational level. As a consequence, differences are small (although there are some). The only \nsector where there are substantial differences in allocation rules is electric power, where \nsome Central European power producers will enjoy softer auctioning rules than their Western \npeers in phase III of the system.  However, the derogation is temporary and there is relatively \nlittle cross-border electricity trading in Europe so the competitiveness effect is small. \nAnother area where coordination across systems is important is the treatment of carbon \noffsets, such as certified emission reductions from the CDM. There has to be alignment both \nin terms of the quality (environmental integrity) and the quantity of offsets permitted into a \nsystem. Most cap and trade systems limit the number of offset credits that can be imported \ninto the system. The current version of the Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is a \nnotable exception (Government of Australia, 2008).  Different systems also impose varying \ndegrees of quality requirements. The EU ETS, for example, does not recognise forestry \ncredits.  Once systems are linked any such differences disappear de facto.  Credits may enter \nthe market through the national system with the most permissive rules, where they can be \nswapped into freely tradable allowances.  \n3.4 Competitiveness issues \nOne of the main questions in designing a unilateral cap-and-trade system is how to prevent \ncarbon leakage and the loss of international competitiveness. The two issues are linked.  \nLeakage and competitiveness are the environmental and economic side of the same coin.  \nFirms facing higher production costs due to carbon regulation are at a disadvantage in the \ninternational market and will lose market share to competitors with less stringent carbon \nconstraints.  Multinational firms may choose to relocate production to avoid carbon \nregulations.  In either case, emissions and economic activity move away from the regulated \nspace to less-strictly regulated regions.  Even if this does not happen, mitigation action in the \nregulated market could lead to a fall in the demand of high-carbon fuels like coal, whose price \nwill drop as a consequence.  This will in turn stimulate demand (and reduce the cost base) \noutside the regulated market.  The result is again carbon leakage and a loss in \ncompetitiveness. \nThe problem is most acute between regulated and unregulated markets but it applies \nsimilarly to regions with different carbon prices and different levels of ambition. Most studies \n  Carbon markets in space \n13 \nsuggest that competitiveness issues are restricted to a small number of sectors (Carbon Trust \n2008).   Nevertheless it is an important concern. \nCompetitive issues become smaller the wider and more integrated the carbon market \nbecomes as an increasing share of a sector is covered by equivalent regulation. Linking is \ntherefore the first-best-choice of resolving competitiveness problems and preventing leakage.  \nIf linking is not possible the next best solution is to create a level playing field in those sectors \nwhere international competition is particularly strong and the problem thus most acute.  In \nsome cases, it may be feasible to create a fully-fledged sector-level trading system. \nInternational shipping is one sector where this is contemplated.  In other cases it may help to \nimpose similar regulatory requirements on firms inside a trading system (through a carbon \nprice) and outside the system (through equivalent regulation).  Sector agreements are \ncontemplated, for example, in steel.  However, they are difficult to set up because production \nprocesses and national circumstances differ, which makes it hard to define meaningful \ntechnical benchmarks.7  Other problems arise, including the challenge of creating incentive \nfor participation by companies in non-regulated regions, and ensuring compliance and \nenforcement. \nThe favourite instrument to address competitiveness issues, at least in the EU, has so far been \nthe free allocation of allowances to installations that are subject to international \ncompetition.8  From an economic point of view, the effectiveness of this measure is \nuncertain.  Free allocation does not change the value of allowances and should therefore not \naffect the behaviour of firms at the margin.  An allowance has the same opportunity cost \nwhether it has to be purchased on the market or was received for free.  Free allocation may \nmake a difference, though in the presence of transaction costs or firm-internal dynamics.  \nRelocating factories is costly, particularly if unions and local stakeholders are involved, and \nmay affect a firm\u2019s standing in the home market. Perhaps demonstrating profitability \n(however achieved) is sufficient for managers to keep an installation open.  However, such \nshort-term arguments become less convincing once a trading system has been operational for \na few years. \n                                                          \n7\n Vivid Economics (2008) and Michaelowa et al. (2008) provide a discussion of sectoral trading \napproaches. \n8\n Free allocation is also a way to obtain buy-in from industry and to compensate stranded assets \ncreated through abrupt regulatory change. In political economy terms this is a key reason why cap-and-\ntrade systems are easier to implement than a carbon tax. \n  Carbon markets in space \n14 \nThe final alternative to deal with competitiveness problems is border tax adjustments. This \noption is discussed for example by Brewer (2004) and Ismer and Neuhoff (2007).   \n  Carbon markets in space \n15 \n4 Conclusion \nThere are compelling reasons to establish a long-term ambition for a global carbon market.  \nWe have defined the \u2018global carbon market\u2019 not in the sense of a globally administered and \nregulated trading regime, but in the sense of a mosaic of regional and national markets that \nare linked and whose level of ambition is consistent with the overarching aims of climate \nchange policy.  National or regional carbon markets may be linked directly (presumably with \nimport limits) or indirectly through common products like CERs or forest offsets that are \naccepted in all systems. \nThe current flurry of national and regional initiatives to set up carbon markets is a welcome \nopportunity for experimentation and innovation, allowing the opportunity to explore \ndifferent designs. But there is also a risk that the results will create incompatibilities that limit \nthe potential for linking and result in a fragmented global market in which the benefits of \n\u201cwhere\u201d flexibility are not fully explored.  \nThere is merit in experimentation and learning.  The concept of emissions trading is not new \n(Dales, 1968), and nor is the practice of emissions trading, but carbon markets on the scale, \nambition and planetary importance of those currently emerging have never been seen \nbefore.  We do not yet have all the answers on how these carbon markets should be designed \nand implemented.  For example, the experience with phase I of the EU ETS has resulted in \nimportant lessons on auctioning, banking and information release that have now been \nincorporated in the design of subsequent systems.  Experience with RGGI has also been \nenlightening.  Continued innovation generates valuable lessons. \nHowever, the right balance has to be found between experimentation and the need to make \nsystems compatible so that they can eventually be linked up. The gains from trade (section \n3.1) from linking are potentially enormous, even if the linked systems have identical \nestimated ambition (and hence carbon price) ex ante.   \nDesign features that may generate political or economic obstacles to linking include: \ndifferences of ambition, treatment of free allocation vs auctioning, price management \npolicies (including price ceilings, price floors, allowance reserves, auction reserve prices), \nrules on borrowing, and treatment of offsets.  Design differences along these dimensions \ncontribute to increased economic issues, design problems or political concerns about \nfinancial flows from one system to the other. \n \n  Carbon markets in space \n16 \nHowever, few of them constitute an insurmountable obstacle to linking developed country \nsystems and advancing towards an overall long-run objective of establishing a global carbon \nmarket to reduce emissions.  While there are factors discussed in this paper that counsel \nagainst full liberalisation of markets across space, taking advantage of \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility (and \n\u201cwhen\u201d flexibility, see Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010) is critical to minimising the costs of \nmitigating emissions and responding to climate change.   \n  Carbon markets in space \n17 \nReferences \nAmerican Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009: 111th Congress, 1st Session, Discussion \ndraft, 31 March 2009. \nBaumol, W.
