The\nfirst aim of our study was to examine the relationships between\nanaerobic swimming performance and individual morphometric\nmeasurements in the shiner perch. Shiner perch (Cymatogaster\naggregata), is a conspicuous and abundant surf perch of the\nPacific Northwest that lives in complex habitat. Fast start\nresponses of 40 fish were first recorded. Latency (time from\nstimulus to visible response movement) and coordinate data\nwere collected for the center of mass and snout positions. From\nthese coordinates, smoothed velocity, acceleration profiles, tur-\nning radii and turning angles were calculated. Then 14 morpho-\nlogic characteristics were measured on each fish (body shape,\ntail shape, white muscle). The second objective of this study was\nto determine the temporal stability of fast start performance.\nThus, we repeated 4 successive tests on each 40 fish.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.cbpa.2007.01.225A6.52\nRegional variation in the microhardness and mineral\ncontent of porcine long bones\nH. Bonney, A. Goodman, B. Colston, (University of Lincoln,\nUnited Kingdom)\nPig carcasses are frequently used as models for the human\ncadaver in the study of trauma and wound patterns. Limited\navailability and ethical concerns over the use of human tissue\nhas meant that porcine bone is often used as a substitute for\nhuman bone in such studies. However, there is a lack of\ncomprehensive mechanical data to make informed decisions on\nthe choice of model to account for variations in the age, sex and\nbody mass.\nIn this study, variation in the properties of cortical bone along\nthe length of the porcine humerus and ulna, from five female\npigs aged over 36 months, was investigated by using Vickers\nmicrohardness tests. Transverse sections were taken from the\nproximal, mid and distal regions of the diaphyses, and tests\nwere carried out in the anterior, medial, posterior, and lateral\nquadrants. Microhardness was also measured across the cortex\nfrom the periosteal to endosteal surfaces. Regional variation in\nmineral content was explored by analysing samples, taken\nimmediately adjacent to the hardness tests, using Atomic\nAbsorption Spectroscopy.\nMechanical data are discussed in relation to mineral content,\nmorphology and loading of the limbs, within a forensic context.\ndoi:10.1016\/j.cbpa.2007.01.226\nA6.53\nHow do tree frogs adhere well to smooth surfaces and yet\ndetach easily when necessary?\nJ. Platter, J. Pearman, J. Barnes, (Glasgow University, Scotland)Tree frogs adhere well to smooth surfaces even when they are\ntilted well beyond the vertical. Some small species can even\nadhere when completely upside-down. Yet, when walking or\njumping, tree frogs detach their toe pads easily without\nsignificant pull-off forces. Detachment has previously been\nshown to occur by peeling (Hanna and Barnes, 1991), but how\nis peeling controlled? Why doesn't a tree frog on an\noverhanging surface simply peel off rather than adhere? To\ninvestigate this, we have recorded adhesive and shear\n(frictional) forces simultaneously from single toe pads in the\nhylid tree frog, Litoria caerulea. By varying the angle of pull,\nwe were able to examine the effect of angle on both force\ncomponents and test whether there is a particular range of\nangles at which peeling takes place. From these data, it appears\nthat there is no rapid transition from adhesion to peeling.\nHowever, adhesive forces decline gradually with increasing\nangles of pull, particularly for angles beyond 90\u00b0, and are\nnegligible above 150\u00b0. Thus frogs maintain a grip by keeping\nthe angle of their toes with respect to the substrate at a low\nvalue, and detach by increasing this angle to beyond 90\u00b0.\nThese data are supported by behavioural observations on tree\nfrogs adhering to smooth surfaces that are tilted from 0\u00b0 to\n180\u00b0. At increasing angles, legs are spread out sideways so that\nangles between feet and substrate are kept as low as possible.\nHanna, G. and Barnes, W.J.P., 1991. J. Exp.

Lentink, (Wageningen University, The\nNetherlands)\nThe hydrodynamics of undulatory swimming are still poorly\nunderstood. Different gaits and corresponding wake structures\nmay have evolved for energetic efficiency, but could also result\nfrom other developmental, evolutionary or hydrodynamic\nconstraints. To research this in detail we set out to develop a\nswim tunnel with as laminar a flow field as possible for PIVand\nkinematics research. The setup accommodates Zebra fish\n(Danio rerio) of different ages at Reynolds numbers ranging\nfrom 30 to 30000. For flow analysis background vorticity and\nturbulence must be minimised to adequately visualise and study\nthe wake structures.\nThree basic designs were analysed: A classical pump driven\npipe flow tunnel, a caterpillar driven concentric tank, and a\nspinning annular flow tank; a fish wheel.\nTo gain insight into their differences, we analysed the three\ndesigns by means of 2D CFD simulations. The results show that\nthe classic tunnel design suffers from excessive boundary layers\nat low speeds and will become turbulent at higher Reynolds\nnumbers. The caterpillar tank produces a large amount of\n"}
