Objective: Chronic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (\u03b2-blocker) treatment \nreduces the incidence of reversion to AF in patients, possibly via an adaptive myocardial response. However, \nthe underlying electrophysiological mechanisms are presently unclear. We aimed to investigate \nelectrophysiological changes in human atrial cells associated with chronic treatment with \u03b2-blockers and \nother cardiovascular-acting drugs. Methods: Myocytes were isolated enzymatically from the right atrial \nappendage of 40 consenting patients who were in sinus rhythm. The cellular action potential duration (APD), \neffective refractory period (ERP), L-type Ca\n2+\n current (ICaL), transient (ITO) and sustained (IKSUS) outward K\n+\n \ncurrents, and input resistance (Ri) were recorded using the whole cell patch clamp. Drug treatments and \nclinical characteristics were compared with electrophysiological measurements using simple and multiple \nregression analyses. P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: In atrial cells from patients treated \nchronically with \u03b2-blockers, the APD90 and ERP (75 beats\/min stimulation) were significantly longer, at \n213\u00b111 and 233\u00b111 ms, respectively (n=15 patients), than in cells from non-\u03b2-blocked patients, at 176\u00b112 \nand 184\u00b112 ms (n=11). These cells also displayed a significantly reduced action potential phase 1 velocity \n(22\u00b13 vs 34\u00b13 V\/s). Chronic \u03b2-blockade was also associated with a significant reduction in the heart rate \n(58\u00b13 vs 69\u00b15 beats\/min) and in the density of ITO (8.7\u00b11.3 vs 13.7\u00b12.1 pA\/pF), an increase in the Ri \n(214\u00b124 vs 132\u00b114 M\u2126), but no significant change in ICaL or IKSUS. The ITO blocker 4-aminopyridine largely \nmimicked the changes in phase 1 and ERP associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade, in cells from non-\u03b2-blocked \npatients. Chronic treatment of patients with calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme \ninhibitors (n=11-13 patients) was not associated with any significant changes in atrial cell electrophysiology. \nConclusion: The observed atrial cellular electrophysiological changes associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade \nare consistent with a long term adaptive response, a type of \u201cpharmacological remodelling\u201d, and provide \nmechanistic evidence supportive of the anti-arrhythmic actions of \u03b2-blockade. \n \nKeywords: Discipline: Experimental; Objective: Heart; Level: Cellular; Field: Electrophysiology, \nPathophysiology, Pharmacology.

It is associated with a \nsubstantial decrease in the quality and expectancy of life, and is becoming more prevalent [1]. Beta-\nadrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) have a well established efficacy for controlling the ventricular rate \nduring AF, by slowing atrioventricular conduction. \u03b2-blockade is also recognised to reduce the recurrence of \nadrenergically-mediated AF, for example after cardiothoracic surgery [2]. However, evidence is \naccumulating that \u03b2-blockade may also exert anti-arrhythmic actions in other groups of patients with AF. \nMetoprolol was more effective than placebo [3], and bisoprolol was as effective as sotalol [4], in preventing \nrelapse into AF after cardioversion. Additionally, atenolol reduced the incidence and duration of paroxysmal \nAF [5]. \n The mechanisms of these \u03b2-blocker effects are presently unclear, but may involve a long term adaptive \nchange in myocardial electrophysiology. Animal studies have indicated that chronic \u03b2-blockade prolonged \nthe action potential duration (APD) in atria and ventricles [6]. However, the effects of chronic \u03b2-blockade on \nhuman myocardial repolarisation are presently unclear, with conflicting reports in the ventricle (lengthening \n[7] and shortening [8]) and no available data, to our knowledge, in the atrium. \n AF is maintained by intra-atrial reentry, facilitated by a shortened atrial effective refractory period \n(ERP). Atrial electrophysiological remodelling due to AF contributes to stabilisation of the arrhythmia, and \nis associated with shortening of the APD and ERP, as confirmed recently in our laboratory in human atrial \nmyocytes [9]. It is conceivable, therefore, that the anti-fibrillatory effects of \u03b2-blockers might involve, \nthrough an adaptive response to their chronic use, a prolongation of the atrial cell APD and ERP. We wished \nto test this hypothesis, examine potential ionic mechanisms involved, and assess, for comparison, \nelectrophysiological changes associated with chronic use of other drugs acting on the cardiovascular system. \n The objective, therefore, was to investigate changes in human atrial cell action potentials, ERP and ion \ncurrents associated with chronic use of \u03b2-blockers and other cardiovascular-acting drugs. \n \n \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n3 \nMethods \nCell isolation \n Right atrial appendage tissue was obtained from 40 patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery \n(Table 1). Procedures approved by the institutional research ethics committee were followed, and each \npatient's informed consent was obtained. The investigation conforms with the principles outlined in the \nDeclaration of Helsinki [10]. Atrial cells were isolated enzymatically with protease (Type XXIV, Sigma, \n4U\/ml) and collagenase (Type 1, Worthington, 400 U\/ml) using the method described previously [9].  \n \nElectrical recording \nAction potentials and ion currents were recorded using the whole cell patch clamp technique, with an \nAxopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments). Cells were superfused at 37\no\nC with a physiological salt solution \ncontaining (mM): NaCl (130.0), KCl (4.0), CaCl2 (2.0), MgCl2 (1.0), glucose (10.0) and HEPES (10.0). The \npipette solution contained (mM): K-aspartate (110.0), KCl (20.0), MgCl2 (1.0), EGTA (0.15), Na2ATP (4.0), \nNa2GTP (0.4) and HEPES (5.0). Series resistance and capacitative transients were compensated \nelectronically prior to recording. Action potentials were stimulated using 5 ms duration current pulses of 1.2x \nthreshold strength, after current clamping the resting potential to -75 mV and keeping the holding current \nconstant thereafter. The ERP was measured using a standard S1-S2 stimulation protocol, with an 8-pulse \nconditioning train (75 beats\/min), and S1 and S2 pulses of equal magnitude. The ERP was defined as the \nlongest S1-S2 interval failing to elicit an S2 action potential of amplitude >80% of the preceding S1 action \npotential. The APD was calculated as the interval between the action potential upstroke and repolarisation to \nthe level of both 50 and 90% (APD50 and APD90, respectively). The voltage clamp was used to record the \ncells\u2019 input resistance (Ri), the L-type Ca\n2+\n current (ICaL), the transient outward K\n+\n current (ITO) and the \nsustained outward K\n+\n current (IKSUS). Ri was determined using a linear voltage ramp (increasing from -120 \nmV to +50 mV in 7 s) from the slope of the ohmic portion of the resulting current-voltage relationship, \nusually between -120 mV and -100 mV. ICaL was stimulated from a holding potential of -40 mV, with 100 ms \npulses (0.33 Hz), increasing from -30 mV to +50 mV in 10 mV steps. ICaL was measured at each voltage step \nas the peak inward deflection minus the current at the end of the pulse. ITO and IKSUS were stimulated from a \nholding potential of -60 mV, with 100 ms pulses (0.33 Hz), increasing from -50 mV to +60 mV in 10 mV \nsteps. IKSUS was measured as the steady-state (end-pulse) current, and ITO as the peak positive deflection \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n4 \nminus the end-pulse current at each voltage step. The same electrode filling solution was used for recording \naction potentials and ion currents, permitting their comparison under constant ionic conditions, and often in \nthe same cell. Contamination of ICaL and ITO by K\n+\n currents was minimised as far as possible, by the \nsubtraction of the steady-state currents. Each current\u2019s density was calculated as the peak amplitude (ie: at \n+10 mV for ICaL, +60 mV for ITO and +60 mV for IKSUS) divided by the cell\u2019s capacity, prior to the statistical \nanalyses and graphing of mean data. Action potentials and ion currents were stimulated, recorded and \nmeasured using \u201cWinWCP\u201d software, donated by J Dempster, Strathclyde University. \n \nData analysis and statistics \n Details of each patient\u2019s clinical characteristics and drug treatments were obtained from the case notes. \nThe cardiac rhythm and heart rate were assessed from the pre-operative electrocardiogram. Only those \npatients in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery were included. Patient and associated cellular \nelectrophysiological data were stored in a database (Access, Microsoft) for subsequent analysis. Univariate \nelectrophysiological measurements were compared between pairs of various subgroups of patients using 2-\nsided, 2-sample unpaired Student's t tests. Univariate data are expressed as cell means\u00b1standard error (SE). \nMultiple linear regression [11] was then used to further investigate associations between patients\u2019 atrial \nelectrophysiology and drug treatments or clinical characteristics. This provided an estimate of the difference \nin each electrophysiological measurement between the levels of the factor of interest, according to 8 \nvariables considered to be of particular importance. These were the patients\u2019 drug treatments (\u03b2-blockers, \ncalcium channel blockers [CCBs] and angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), age (for a 5 year \nincrease), sex, heart rate (for a 5 beats\/min increase), and the presence or absence of coronary artery bypass \ngraft (CABG) surgery or previous myocardial infarction. Two multiple regressions were fitted: firstly, by \ntaking into account all covariables, and secondly (when comparing patients taking a drug with those not), by \ntaking as covariables only those drugs additional to the one under consideration. All analyses were \nperformed using \u201cSAS 8.2 for Windows NT\u201d software. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. \nP<0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.  \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n5 \nResults \nPatients\u2019 drug treatments \n The patients\u2019 characteristics are shown in Table 1. Drugs were administered chronically, with each \npatient receiving their routine cardiac drugs on the day of surgery. All patients undergoing \u03b2-blockade were \ntreated with cardiac selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonists, with 88% on atenolol, 8% on metoprolol and 4% \non bisoprolol. No patients were administered sotalol (which has additional class III activity). Of the patients \ntreated with CCBs, 33% were receiving diltiazem, a predominantly cardiac-acting drug. The remaining 67% \nwere taking drugs with mixed vascular and cardiac actions, but with vascular activity predominating, \nincluding amlodipine (44%), nifedipine (17%) and nicardipine (6%). Twelve patients were taking both \u03b2-\nblockers and CCBs. The ACE inhibitors administered included lisinopril (50%), captopril (21%), ramipril \n(21%) and enalapril (7%). Of the 14 patients on ACE inhibitors, 9 were on \u03b2-blockers, and 6 on CCBs. All \ncardio-active drugs had been administered for a minimum duration of 3 months. \n \nAtrial cellular electrophysiological changes associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade \n Figure 1A shows original action potential traces and ERP measurements, from single atrial cells \nrepresentative of patients not treated (top trace) and treated (bottom trace) with \u03b2-blockers. Chronic \u03b2-\nblockade was associated with a lengthening of both the ERP and late repolarisation. Univariate analysis \n(simple regression) indicated that the mean APD90 and ERP were markedly and significantly longer in atrial \ncells from the patients receiving \u03b2-blockers, at 213\u00b111 ms (n=21 cells, 15 patients) and 233\u00b111 ms (n=16 \ncells, 11 patients), respectively, than in the non-treated patients, at 176\u00b112 ms (n=20 cells, 11 patients) and \n184\u00b112 ms (n=17 cells, 10 patients), respectively (Figure 1B). The univariate means within each patient \ngroup, and the probability values of differences between groups, were similar whether analysed at cell or \nsubject (patient) level. The changes in APD and ERP associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade were independent \nof cell capacity or holding current, each of which were similar in \u03b2-blocker-treated and non-treated patients, \nat 74\u00b14 pF (n=36 cells, 21 patients) vs 81\u00b13 pF (n=28 cells, 15 patients, P=0.22), and 57\u00b17 pA (n=30 cells, \n18 patients) vs 60\u00b17 pA (n=16 cells, 9 patients, P=0.70), respectively. The mean action potential overshoot, \namplitude and maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) were not significantly different between the cells from \npatients receiving \u03b2-blockers (48\u00b12 mV, 126\u00b13 mV and 149\u00b116 V\/s; n=21 cells, 15 patients, respectively) \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n6 \nand those who were not (53\u00b12 mV, 130\u00b12 mV and 176\u00b115 V\/s; n=20 cells, 11 patients, respectively). The \nheart rate was significantly slower in the patients undergoing \u03b2-blockade (58\u00b13 vs 69\u00b15 beats\/min; P=0.02, \nn=25 and 15, respectively). Multiple regression analysis was used to further investigate associations between \npatients\u2019 characteristics and electrophysiological changes. Table 2 provides an example of this analysis with \nrespect to the atrial cell ERP. With ACE inhibitors and CCBs taken as covariables (\u201cDrugs\u201d), the direction, \nmagnitude and probability value of the estimated difference in ERP between \u03b2-blocker-treated and non-\ntreated patients were similar to that found without adjusting for these covariables. When all covariates were \nconsidered (\u201cAll\u201d), the direction and approximate magnitude of the difference were again maintained, \nalthough the difference was no longer significant. A similar analysis of the APD90 also provided data \nsupportive of the univariate association between \u03b2-blockade and APD-lengthening, with an estimated \nprolongation of 40 ms with drugs as covariables. Simple and multiple regression analysis revealed no \nsignificant associations between atrial cell ERP and the patient\u2019s age, heart rate, or presence of previous \nmyocardial infarction (Table 2). However, simple (but not multiple) regression indicated that both CABG \nsurgery and male sex were associated with prolongation of the ERP. \n The amplitude and density of ITO were markedly smaller in atrial cells from the patients treated with \u03b2-\nblockers than in those from untreated patients, as shown by the representative traces of Figure 2A, and the \nunivariate analysis in Figure 2D. Additionally, the Ri was higher in the atrial cells from patients who \nunderwent \u03b2-blockade than in untreated patients. This is illustrated in Figure 2C (lower trace), by the \nrelatively shallow slope of the ohmic portion of the current-voltage relationship, and confirmed by univariate \nanalysis (Figure 2D). The tangent to the ohmic portion intersected zero current at -81\u00b13 mV (n=15 cells), \ncompared with the predicted K\n+\n equilibrium potential of -93 mV. This suggested that Ri was contributed to \nby the inward rectifier K\n+\n current (IK1). The density of atrial IKSUS was not significantly different between \npatients who were, and who were not, treated with \u03b2-blockers, at 8.81\u00b11.74 pA\/pF (n=10 cells, 7 patients) \nand 7.37\u00b11.14 pA\/pF (n=8 cells, 4 patients, respectively; P=0.77), as represented in Figure 2A. The density \nof ICaL also was not significantly different between treated and untreated patients, at -6.76\u00b11.14 pA\/pF (n=17 \ncells, 8 patients) and -4.77\u00b10.99 pA\/pF (n=6 cells, 4 patients, respectively (P=0.34), as represented in Figure \n2B. These data for ITO, Ri, IKSUS and ICaL were supported by multiple regression: with the \u201cDrugs\u201d model, the \nestimated magnitude of the reduction in ITO was 6.9 pA\/pF (P=0.03). In this analysis, the magnitude (but not \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n7 \nthe probability value) of the increase in Ri was also maintained. The absence of significant change in ICaL and \nIKSUS was also confirmed, whether the analysis incorporated all of the covariables, or the drugs alone. Since a \nreduction in atrial ITO has also been associated with congestive heart failure [12], a sub-analysis of \nelectrophysiological data was performed in patients with and without significant (moderate or severe) left \nventricular dysfunction (LVD). Eleven of the 25 \u03b2-blocker-treated patients (44%) had significant LVD, and 4 \nof the 15 non-\u03b2-blocker-treated patients (27%) had significant LVD. There was no significant difference in \nthe proportion of patients with significant LVD between the two patient sub-groups (P=0.28). Within both of \nthese sub-groups, there was no significant difference between patients with and without LVD, in the atrial \ncell ERP, APD90, ITO or Ri. \n The potential contribution of the observed reduction in atrial ITO to associated changes in repolarisation \nand refractoriness was evaluated. Chronic \u03b2-blockade, in addition to prolonging the ERP (Figure 1), was \nassociated with a significant slowing of the action potential maximum downstroke velocity, phase 1 Vmax \n(Figure 3A). The ITO blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) produced a similar reduction in phase 1 Vmax in cells \nfrom non-\u03b2-blocker-treated patients (Figure 3B), which was also accompanied by a significant prolongation \nin the ERP (Figure 3C). \n \nLack of electrophysiological changes associated with calcium channel blockade or ACE inhibition \n Chronic calcium channel blockade or ACE inhibition was not associated with any significant changes in \nthe APD or ERP, as indicated by univariate mean data, shown in Figure 4. The action potential overshoot, \namplitude and Vmax were 49\u00b12 mV, 128\u00b12 mV and 160\u00b117 V\/s, respectively, in atrial cells from patients not \ntreated with CCBs, and 51\u00b12 mV, 128\u00b13 mV and 164\u00b115 V\/s, respectively, in cells from patients not treated \nwith ACE inhibitors. Chronic treatment with either drug was not significantly associated with a change in \nany of these values. A comparison of data from patients receiving CCBs acting predominantly on the \nmyocardium with those exerting mixed actions but mainly affecting the vasculature, indicated no significant \ndifferences in atrial cell electrophysiology between the drug sub-types. For example, the ERP in patients \nreceiving cardiac- and vascular-acting drugs was 223\u00b113 and 201\u00b126 ms, respectively, not significantly \ndifferent from each other or from the combined mean (214\u00b113 ms). There were also no significant \ndifferences in the magnitudes of ICaL, ITO, IKSUS, or the Ri between patients treated and not treated with either \nCCBs or ACE inhibitors. Multiple regression analysis supported the lack of association between action \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n8 \npotential configuration, duration, the ERP, ion currents, and treatment with either CCBs or ACE inhibitors. \nTable 2 provides an example of this, indicating a lack of statistical significance of any estimated difference \nin the ERP between non-treated and treated patients, at either level of analysis, ie: with drugs alone, or with \nconsideration of all covariates.\nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n9 \nDiscussion \n We report the novel finding that chronic \u03b2-blockade was associated with prolongation of action \npotentials and the ERP in human atrial cells. These changes represent an adaptive response, a type of \n\u201cpharmacological remodelling\u201d, whereby chronic blockade of the \u03b2-adrenoceptors resulted in alterations of \nion current density, recorded independently of receptor occupancy, ie: in the absence of drugs. This response \nmay contribute to the anti-fibrillatory actions of \u03b2-blockade by prolonging refractoriness, and thus \nlengthening the minimum path length required for reentry. Moreover, during \u03b2-blocker therapy, such actions \nmay be enhanced by the presence of the drug itself and would also persist in patients who miss a dose, which \nmay offset the potentially pro-arrhythmic effects of increased atrial sensitivity to catecholamines and 5-HT \n[13-15]. \n Our results are the first, to our knowledge, to be obtained from human atrium, and are consistent with \nprevious studies in animals [6,16]. Thus, chronic metoprolol treatment in rabbits lengthened the atrial APD, \nas well as the ventricular APD and ERP, and the QTc interval [6], and the atrial effects were similar in \nmagnitude to those reported here. In humans, only effects on the ventricle have been studied, and chronic \u03b2-\nblockade prolonged both QT interval and monophasic action potentials [7,17] especially during exercise \n[18]. However, an absence of change [19,20] or even a shortening [8], in QT interval or ERP have also been \nreported. Differences between human atrial and ventricular responses may be expected, in view of, for \nexample, the presence of a sustained outward current in human atrium but not ventricle, and the relatively \nslow recovery kinetics of atrial ITO [21]. Additionally, pharmacological remodelling by \u03b2-blockade in the \nrabbit was more rapid in the atrium than in the ventricle [6]. \n The present study also addressed ionic changes underlying the effects of chronic \u03b2-blockade in \nhuman myocardium. We demonstrated a reduction in atrial ITO associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade, and \nprovided evidence to suggest that this may be a contributory ionic mechanism for the lengthening of the \naction potential and ERP. Thus, the velocity of phase 1, which is dependent on the magnitude of both ITO and \nICaL, was reduced by chronic \u03b2-blockade, in the absence of a change in ICaL. Furthermore, \u03b2-blocker-induced \nchanges in both phase 1 and ERP were largely mimicked, in cells from non-\u03b2-blocker-treated patients, by the \nITO blocker, 4-AP. However, it is recognised that 4-AP, whilst the most specific ITO blocker currently \navailable, also blocks the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K\n+\n current, IKur, at concentrations well below those \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n10 \nrequired to block ITO, and, therefore, that the effects of 4-AP on both the APD and ERP should be interpreted \nwith caution. A further potential limitation is that a reduced density of atrial ITO has been demonstrated in \ndogs with congestive heart failure, associated with an increase in cell capacity, but with no change in APD at \nphysiological rate [12]. In the present study, however, the effects of chronic \u03b2-blockade to reduce ITO density \nwere independent of cell capacity, which was similar in treated and untreated groups. Moreover, the atrial \ncell APD, ERP, ITO density and Ri were all similar in the patients with and without left ventricular \ndysfunction. Chronic \u03b2-blockade was associated with an increase in atrial Ri, which may be expected to have \nbeen due, at least in part, to a decrease in IK1. However, it is acknowledged that IK1 was not measured \ndirectly, and that a change in IK1 might have occurred within the physiological voltage range, rather than at \nthe potentials at which changes in Ri were observed. Nevertheless, our data raise the possibility that IK1 may \ndecrease as a result of chronic \u03b2-blockade, and as such, a contribution to the associated lengthening in the \nAPD and ERP cannot be excluded.  \n The mechanisms of these electrophysiological changes associated with chronic \u03b2-blockade are presently \nunclear. A chronically slowed heart rate by \u03b2-blockade might lengthen the atrial APD and ERP recorded at \nconstant stimulation rate, analogous to their shortening resulting from chronic fast atrial rate [9]. However, \nthe multiple regression analysis indicated that the observed prolongation of APD and ERP was independent \nof heart rate. An alternative mechanism is a direct regulation of expression of ion channels by chronic \u03b2-\nreceptor modulation. Chronic \u03b2-blockade alone has not been studied, but chronic \u03b2-stimulation has been \nshown to alter ion channels, via mechanisms including cAMP-regulated modification of transcription \n[22,23]. In guinea pig cultured ventricular myocytes, exposure to isoproterenol for 48 hours reduced the \ndensity of IK1, ICaL, and the delayed rectifier current IKs, which was reversed by co-incubation with \npropranolol [22]. Additionally, chronic \u03b2-stimulation increased the density of ITO in canine cultured \nventricular myocytes [24], and an increase in both ITO and IK1 occurred during sympathetic innervation of \nnewborn rat hearts [25]. If one speculated that chronic \u03b2-blockade might produce the opposite effects, then a \nreduced ITO and IK1, as reported here, would be predicted by some [24,25], but not all [22], studies. \n Chronic calcium channel blockade or ACE inhibition were not associated with adaptive changes in atrial \nion currents, action potentials or the ERP. Human atrial ICaL was increased by acute ACE inhibition [26], but \nno studies could be found with chronic ACE inhibition. In a single report of effects of chronic CCB \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n11 \ntreatment on human atrial electrophysiology [26], a reduction in both the APD50 and ICaL was observed. \nWhilst the ERP was unchanged, consistent with our study, it is unclear why our results differ with respect to \nAPD50 and ICaL. Animal studies of chronic calcium channel blockade have shown an absence of change in \nseveral myocardial electrophysiological and related measurements, including reports of no change [27], and \neven an increase [28] in ICaL. Consistent with the presently observed absence of associated atrial \nelectrophysiological changes, neither chronic calcium channel blockade nor ACE inhibition has a proven \nefficacy in the treatment of AF [29]. \n Pharmacological intervention is the mainstay of current treatment for AF. However, the use of anti-\narrhythmic agents with established efficacy for treating AF, ie: from classes 1C and III, may be precluded by \nthe presence of associated heart disease and risk of serious side effects [29]. The role of \u03b2-blockers in the \ntreatment of patients with AF is becoming increasingly recognised [3-5]. The presently observed atrial \ncellular adaptive electrophysiological responses to chronic \u03b2-blockade provide mechanistic evidence \nsupportive of the anti-arrhythmic actions of \u03b2-blockade. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank the British Heart Foundation for financial support, and the Glasgow Royal Infirmary cardiac \nsurgical operating teams for kindly providing atrial tissue. \nManuscript No. CVRA\/2002\/911\/R1. \n12 \nReferences \n \n [1] Peters NS, Schilling RJ, Kanagaratnam P, Markides V.

CCB=calcium channel blocker, CABG=coronary artery bypass graft surgery, \nAVR=aortic valve replacement, ASD=atrial septal defect, VSD=ventricular septal defect, LV=left \nventricular, MI=myocardial infarction. All patients were in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery. \n \nTable 2. Multiple regression analysis of the atrial cell refractory period. \nERP=effective refractory period, ACEI=ACE inhibitors, BB=\u03b2-blockers, HR=heart rate. The model is either \n\u201cAlone\u201d (univariate), \u201cDrugs\u201d (adjusting for all drugs) or \u201cAll\u201d (adjusting for all covariates). ERP \nestimate=estimated difference in mean ERP between highest (eg: drug-treatment) and lowest (eg: non-drug-\ntreatment) level of variable, or male minus female. Values are subject (patient) means\u00b1standard error (SE); \n*=P<0.05. \n \nFigure 1. \nAtrial cell action potential and refractory period changes associated with chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment. \nA, Superimposed action potentials in response to the 7th and 8th of a train of 8 conditioning, S1, pulses (basic \nrate: 75 beats\/min) followed by responses to an increasingly premature test, S2, pulse ( in an atrial cell from a \npatient not treated (\u0001) and treated (\u0002) with a \u03b2-blocker. The effective refractory period (ERP), indicated in \neach panel by a solid bar, was calculated as the longest S1-S2 interval failing to elicit an S2 response of \namplitude >80% of the preceding S1 action potential. In each case, the S2 response thus used to measure this \ninterval is labelled (\u0003).
