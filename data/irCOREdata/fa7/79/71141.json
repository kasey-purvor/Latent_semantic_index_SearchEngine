We are able to demonstrate that a multi-spacecraft approach, coupled with a realistic model of flux tube motion in the magnetosheath, enables us to infer the approximate position of the reconnection site, which in this case was located at near-equatorial latitudes.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2005-02<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/6659\/1\/art_679.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5194\/angeo-23-445-2005<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Wild, J.

We present magnetic field and particle data\nrecorded by the Cluster and Geotail satellites in the vicin-\nity of the high- and low-latitude dayside magnetopause, re-\nspectively, on 17 February 2003. A favourable conjunction\nof these spacecraft culminated in the observation of a se-\nries of flux transfer events (FTEs), characterised by bipolar\nperturbations in the component of the magnetic field normal\nto the magnetopause, an enhancement in the overall mag-\nnetic field strength, and field tilting effects in the plane of\nthe magnetopause whilst the satellites were located on the\nmagnetosheath side of the boundary. Whilst a subset of the\nFTE signatures observed could be identified as being either\nnormal or reverse polarity, the rapid succession of events ob-\nserved made it difficult to classify some of the signatures un-\nambiguously. Nevertheless, by considering the source region\nand motion of flux tubes opened by magnetic reconnection at\nlow latitudes (i.e. between Cluster and Geotail), we demon-\nstrate that the observations are consistent with the motion of\nnorthward (southward) and tailward moving flux tubes an-\nchored in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere passing in\nclose proximity to the Cluster (Geotail) satellites. We are\nable to demonstrate that a multi-spacecraft approach, cou-\npled with a realistic model of flux tube motion in the mag-\nnetosheath, enables us to infer the approximate position of\nthe reconnection site, which in this case was located at near-\nequatorial latitudes.\nKey words.

Wild\n(j.wild@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nMagnetic reconnection is the predominant mechanism by\nwhich solar wind energy and momentum are transmitted into\nthe terrestrial magnetospheric cavity. The first in-situ obser-\nvations of transient reconnection in the vicinity of the high-\nlatitude dayside magnetopause were reported by Haerendel\net al. (1978), using magnetic field observations made by the\nHEOS-2 satellite. Exploiting measurements from one of the\nfirst multi-spacecraft missions, Russell and Elphic (1978,\n1979) also reported signatures of magnetic reconnection at\nthe dayside magnetopause. Presenting magnetic field data\nfrom the low-latitude ISEE-1 and 2 spacecraft, these authors\nidentified characteristic bipolar fluctuations in the field com-\nponent normal to the magnetopause (with time scales of a\nfew minutes and a recurrence intervals of \u223c5\u201310 min) and\ndubbed these signatures \u201cflux transfer events\u201d. Further stud-\nies demonstrated that FTEs are usually associated with a\nmixed plasma population originating from both the magneto-\nsphere and magnetosheath (e.g. Paschmann et al., 1982; Far-\nrugia et al., 1988). The interpretation that FTEs were the\nsignatures of transient (few minutes) and localised (few RE)\nbursts of magnetic reconnection at the magnetopause pro-\nposed by Russell and Elphic (1978, 1979) was subsequently\nendorsed by a collection of studies indicating that FTEs were\nmost frequently observed during intervals when there was\na southward directed component of the field in the magne-\ntosheath (e.g. Rijnbeek et al., 1984; Berchem and Russell,\n1984; Kawano and Russell, 1997).\nFrom the earliest observations of FTEs, it was apparent\nthat the characteristic bipolar signature in the magnetic field\ncomponent normal to the magnetopause manifested itself in\nat least two distinct forms. Whilst Russell and Elphic (1978),\n446 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs\nusing high-latitude magnetic field data from the ISEE space-\ncraft, reported observations of bipolar perturbations that were\ndirected first in the outward normal and then the inward nor-\nmal direction (i.e. in the positive then negative normal direc-\ntion), Rijnbeek et al. (1982) presented observations of FTEs\nat equatorial latitudes that were characterised by inward then\noutward (negative-positive) bipolar signatures. These signa-\ntures, referred to as \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201creverse\u201d polarity FTEs,\nwere interpreted as encounters with newly-opened flux tubes\nconnected to the northern and Southern Hemispheres, re-\nspectively. This inference was supported by a host of statisti-\ncal surveys indicating that normal (reverse) polarity FTEs are\nmost commonly observed in the Northern (Southern) Hemi-\nsphere with a mixture of the two observed at equatorial lati-\ntudes (e.g. Berchem and Russell, 1984; Rijnbeek et al., 1984;\nKawano et al., 1992; Russell et al., 1996). In a unique multi-\nspacecraft study exploiting data from the AMPTE UKS and\nISEE spacecraft located in opposite hemispheres, Elphic and\nSouthwood (1987) presented simultaneous observations of\nnormal and reverse polarity FTEs associated with northward\nand southward moving flux tubes, respectively. However, a\nsurvey by Daly et al. (1984), that examined plasma as well\nas magnetic field observations, suggested that the polarity\nof the bipolar signature may not necessarily provide a reli-\nable indication of the hemisphere to which the FTE flux tube\nis connected. The location and extent (both temporally and\nspatially) of magnetic reconnection sites on the surface of the\nmagnetopause remains a subject of active debate. Southwood\nand Farrugia (1988) and Scholer (1988) have suggested that\nthe transient reconnection region is significantly larger than\nthat proposed by Russell and Elphic (1978, 1979), whereas\nMilan et al. (2000) suggested that the reconnection site may\nat any one time be spatially localised, but that it propagates\nwave-like over the magnetopause for extended distances and\nintervals of time (at least \u223c10 min). The study of Milan\nand co-workers differs from others highlighted so far since it\nemployed simultaneous space- and ground-based measure-\nments in order to compare the ionospheric and magneto-\nspheric signatures of magnetic reconnection. Indeed, the po-\ntential to exploit ionospheric observations in order to diag-\nnose reconnection processes at the magnetopause has led to\nthe development of a range of theoretical descriptions that\ncharacterise the ionospheric flow signatures that would re-\nsult from patchy, extended or wave-like reconnection sites\n(e.g. Southwood, 1985, 1987; Cowley, 1986; McHenry and\nClauer, 1987; Lockwood et al., 1990; Wei and Lee, 1990;\nCowley et al., 1991; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992; Milan\net al., 2000; Coleman et al., 2000, 2001). This theoretical\neffort has been matched by a plethora of studies that employ\nground-based observations of the ionosphere, either in iso-\nlation or in coordination with space-based experiments, in\norder to investigate the scale, evolution and occurrence of\nFTEs (e.g. Van Eyken et al., 1984; Lockwood et al., 1989,\n1993; Elphic et al., 1990; Pinnock et al., 1993, 1995; Rodger\nand Pinnock, 1997; Provan et al., 1998, 1999; Provan and\nYeoman, 1999; Milan et al., 1999, 2000; Neudegg et al.,\n1999, 2000, 2001; McWilliams et al., 2000; Chisham et al.,\n2002; McWilliams et al., 2004). The combination of multi-\nple in-situ measurements (from experiments on several spa-\ntially separated spacecraft) and remotely sensed data (from\nground-based experiments) is rapidly emerging as a power-\nful technique that provides multi-point measurements over a\nsignificant fraction of the magnetosphere. However, coordi-\nnated multi-spacecraft missions have so far been uncommon.\nThe advent of the European Space Agency\u2019s Cluster mission\n(Escoubet et al., 1997, 2001) has, for the first time, facilitated\ntruly three-dimensional observations of the magnetosphere.\nSo far, Cluster and Cluster\/ground-based investigations have\nyielded several studies of transient reconnection (e.g. Lock-\nwood et al., 2001a,b; Opgenoorth et al., 2001; Owen et al.,\n2001; Wild et al., 2001, 2003; Maynard et al., 2003; Mar-\nchaudon et al., 2004). However, the relatively small sepa-\nrations of the Cluster spacecraft (typically <1RE), whilst\nideally suited to the study of small- and meso-scale struc-\ntures, are unsuitable for the investigation of structures (such\nas FTEs) evolving over large areas of the magnetopause.\nThe addition of the recently launched Chinese National\nSpace Administration\/European Space Agency pair of Dou-\nbleStar spacecraft will provide measurements at two addi-\ntional points. In particular, the equatorial spacecraft, whose\norbital apogee is \u223c12RE , is designed to encounter the day-\nside low-latitude magnetopause in the same local time sector\nas the Cluster quartet at higher latitudes. In preparation for\nsuch conjunctions, we will therefore examine a similar con-\njunction between the Cluster and Geotail spacecraft. During\nthe interval discussed here, no ground-based data were avail-\nable since at the time of the conjunction, dayside local times\ncorresponded to the Siberian sector (which is poorly instru-\nmented). However, we shall compare the in-situ observations\nto a simple model of magnetosheath and flux tube motion in\norder to investigate the location of reconnection processes on\nthe dayside boundary. We are thus able to constrain the lo-\ncation and size of the reconnection region responsible for the\nFTE signatures observed by Cluster and Geotail.\n2 Instrumentation\nUpstream solar wind and IMF conditions are provided by\nthe Advance Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft (Stone\net al., 1998), located some 225RE upstream of the Earth\nin the vicinity of the Sun-Earth L1 libration point. In par-\nticular, we will present data from the ACE magnetic fields\n(MAG) experiment (Smith et al., 1998) and the solar wind\nelectron, proton, and alpha monitor (SWEPAM)(McComas\net al., 1998). In order to compare the upstream IMF and\nsolar wind conditions with those in the vicinity of the day-\nside magnetopause, the ACE data presented below have been\nlagged to account for the propagation of structure from the\nspacecraft\u2019s location to the terrestrial magnetosphere. In this\ncase, a comparison of upstream ACE IMF observations and\nmeasurements of the magnetic field in the magnetosheath by\nCluster indicated that a propagation delay of \u223c33 min was\nappropriate (this is discussed further below).\nJ.

The orbital motion of the Cluster (coloured circles) and Geotail (black circles) spacecraft presented in the X-Z (left) and X-Y (right)\nGSM planes during the interval 07:00\u201308:00 UT on 17 February 2003.\nFigure 1 presents the motion of the Cluster and Geotail\nspacecraft in the X-Z (left hand panel) and X-Y (right hand\npanel) GSM planes during the interval 07:00\u201308:00 UT on\n17 February 2003. During this interval the Cluster quar-\ntet were moving on an outbound trajectory, traversing the\nhigh-latitude post-noon sector (\u223c13.5 MLT) magnetopause\njust after 07:00 UT. Meanwhile, Geotail was moving (at low\nsouthern latitudes) duskward and Earthward from the noon\nsector magnetosheath toward the post-noon sector magneto-\nsphere (\u223c12.5 MLT). Figure 1 shows the positions of the\nfour Cluster spacecraft (indicated by the colour-coded cir-\ncles) and Geotail (indicated by the filled black circles) at\n07:00 and 08:00 UT. The extent of a model magnetospheric\ncavity (Shue et al., 1997) is indicated in the GSM Y=0 (left\nhand panel), and Z=0 (right hand panel) plane by the dashed\nline. This model is parameterised by the prevailing so-\nlar wind dynamic pressure and north-south (BZ) component\nof the IMF. In this case, we have chosen lagged upstream\nparameters appropriate to the timing of the magnetopause\nencounter by Cluster just after 07:00 UT (PDYN=2.3 nPa\nand BZ=\u22120.8 nT, respectively). Measurements of the lo-\ncal magnetic field, ion and energetic electron populations\nat the Cluster spacecraft are provided by the fluxgate mag-\nnetometer (FGM; see Balogh et al., 1997, 2001) and Clus-\nter ion spectrometry (CIS; see Re`me et al., 1997, 2001) ex-\nperiments, and the research with adaptive particle imaging\ndetectors (RAPID: see Wilken et al., 1997, 2001), respec-\ntively. The four spacecraft FGM data employed in this study\nhave been analysed at a temporal resolution equal to the spin\nperiod of the spacecraft (\u223c4 s). The CIS experiment mea-\nsures moments of the three-dimensional ion distribution be-\ntween energies of a few tens of eV\/e to around 40 keV\/e,\nyielding the total ion number density and velocity at spin\nresolution. The Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) instru-\nment of the RAPID experiment detects electrons with ener-\ngies in the range 20 to 400 keV. In this paper we will present\nomni-directional IES data from spacecraft 3 only. Corre-\nsponding magnetic field and particle observations from the\nGeotail satellite are provided by the Geotail magnetic field\nexperiment (MGF; see Kokubun et al., 1994) and the Geo-\ntail low energy particle experiment (LEP; see Mukai et al.,\n1994). The MGF data, namely 3-component measurements\nof the local magnetic field, have been analysed at a temporal\nresolution approximate equal to the spin period of the Geotail\nspacecraft (nominally \u223c3 s). The LEP package comprises\ntwo sensors, namely the LEP Energy-per-charge Analyzers\n(LEP-EA) and the LEP Solar Wind ion analyzer (LEP-SW).\nThese sensors operate over different energy ranges as well\nas having different geometric properties, and the the LEP in-\nstrument effectively selects either one or other as the primary\nsensor at any given moment. In practice, the reduced size of\nthe SW sensor\u2019s sunward-pointing field-of-view compared to\nthat of the EA device implies that, if immersed in an isotropic\nplasma, the SW sensor will underestimate the local ion den-\nsity and incorrectly measure the ion velocity. Consequently,\nion velocity and density moments are only presented during\nperiods when the LEP instrument was recording data from\nthe EA sensor, spanning the \u223c32 eV\/q\u201338 keV\/q range.\n448 J.

(a) A comparison of the clock angle of the magnetic field\nobserved at ACE (green), Cluster 1 (blue) and Geotail (red) be-\ntween 07:00\u201308:00 UT on 17 February 2003. The ACE data have\nbeen lagged by 33 min. (b) Lagged upstream IMF and solar wind\nmeasurements from the ACE spacecraft. The panels present the X\n(blue), Y (green), and Z (red) GSM components of the interplane-\ntary magnetic field, the total interplanetary magnetic field strength,\nthe solar wind velocity, and the proton concentration, respectively.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary conditions\nFigure 2a presents a comparison of the IMF clock angle ob-\nserved by ACE with the corresponding parameter measured\nat Cluster and Geotail over the interval 07:00\u201308:00 UT.\nThe ACE data (colour-coded green) have been temporally\nlagged by \u223c33 min such that the clock angle variations are\nin approximate agreement with those observed at Cluster\n1 (colour-coded blue) and Geotail (colour-coded red) when\nthese spacecraft were located in the magnetosheath after\n\u223c07:11 UT (discussed in detail below). Whilst the observed\n33-min propagation time of magnetic field structures from\nACE to the dayside magnetosheath is significantly shorter\nthan the delay estimated by, for example, the technique of\nKhan and Cowley (1999) (which in this case was found to\nbe \u223c43 min), the excellent agreement between the lagged\nIMF and magnetosheath clock angles provides confidence\nin the 33-min propagation delay inferred here. Figure 2b\npresents the upstream solar wind and IMF conditions ob-\nserved by ACE during the same interval. These data have\nalso been lagged by \u223c33 min, in order to indicate the ap-\nproximate solar wind and IMF configuration at the subsolar\nmagnetopause between 07:00\u201308:00 UT. During this period,\nthe IMF was generally oriented earthward (GSM BX\u2212ve),\nand duskward (GSM BY+ve) although several brief dawn-\nward excursions were observed. The north-south (GSM BZ)\ncomponent fluctuated throughout, varying between \u00b16 nT.\nThis configuration resulted in an IMF clock angle, defined as\narctan(BY \/BZ), that generally varied between 45\u25e6 and 135\u25e6,\nwhilst the overall magnetic field strength remained relatively\nsteady at \u223c7.5 nT prior to 07:20 UT, falling to \u223c6.5 nT for\nthe remainder of the interval. We note that a sharp increase in\nthe solar wind speed from \u223c600 km s\u22121 to \u223c630 km s\u22121 at\n\u223c07:11 UT resulted in a 10% increase in the solar wind dy-\nnamic pressure. Simultaneously, the dayside magnetopause\ncontracted inward causing the Cluster and Geotail spacecraft\nto simultaneously exit the magnetosphere (as discussed in de-\ntail below). We interpret this motion of the magnetopause as\na response to the increase in solar wind dynamic pressure,\nfurther justifying the chosen 33-min propagation delay ap-\nplied to the ACE observations.\n3.2 Cluster and Geotail observations\nAs indicated in Fig. 2a, at \u223c07:11 UT, the Cluster FGM in-\nstruments recorded a transition from a magnetospheric to a\nmagnetosheath magnetic field configuration. This reorienta-\ntion of the field was accompanied by a significant increase in\nthe concentration and bulk speed of the ions observed by the\nCluster CIS instruments (not shown) which, given the po-\nsition of the spacecraft, we interpret as an encounter with\nthe high-latitude post-noon sector magnetopause. Follow-\ning Cluster\u2019s departure from the magnetospheric cavity, the\nfield and particle signatures of transient magnetic reconnec-\ntion (i.e. FTEs) were observed on the magnetosheath side of\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs 449\nthe boundary. In order to scrutinize these features more care-\nfully we will compare the measurements of ion concentration\nwith the magnetic field data from all available spacecraft,\npresented in a boundary normal coordinate system (Russell\nand Elphic, 1978). We have therefore employed minimum\nvariance analysis (Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967) on the Cluster\nFGM data to determine the outward normal to the boundary\nencountered by spacecraft 1 at \u223c07:11 UT. When applied\nto the interval 07:11\u201307:13 UT, minimum variance analysis\n(MVA) yielded an outward normal vector with GSM compo-\nnents (+0.78, +0.12, +0.61). The direction of this normal,\nbeing predominantly sunward and poleward, with a small\nduskward component, is entirely consistent with the expected\noutward normal of the magnetopause in the high-latitude,\npost-noon sector. The ratio of the intermediate and minimum\neigenvalues of the covariance matrix, a useful indicator of the\nreliability of the solution, was \u223c16, suggesting that the de-\nrived minimum variance direction was robust. Furthermore,\nusing the technique of Khrabrov and Sonnerup (1998), we\nestimate that the angular standard deviation of the derived\nminimum variance vector towards or away from the direc-\ntions of intermediate and maximum variance to be \u223c1\u25e6 and\n\u223c0.4\u25e6, respectively. We are therefore confident that the es-\ntimated outward normal direction was sound. Of course, the\nchief advantage of a multi-spacecraft mission is the ability to\n(a) determine the planarity of the boundary by comparing the\nboundary normal direction calculated at each satellite, and\n(b) estimate any motion of the boundary. In this case, the\nCluster 2 and 4 spacecraft crossed the boundary almost si-\nmultaneously (within one spin-period of the spacecraft), fol-\nlowed by Cluster 1 (some 40 s later), and Cluster 3 (\u223c3 min\nlater still). The derived outward-directed boundary normals\nat Cluster 2 and 4 were in close agreement to the correspond-\ning normal direction at Cluster 1 (these vectors being sepa-\nrated from the spacecraft 1 outward normal by \u223c8\u25e6 and \u223c6\u25e6,\nrespectively). Cluster 3, which started the interval deepest\nwithin the magnetosphere, crossed the magnetopause just af-\nter 07:15 UT. Minimum variance analysis indicated an out-\nward normal almost identical to that observed at the other 3\nspacecraft (e.g. within 3\u25e6 of that at Cluster 1).\nWe therefore infer that the boundary was planar during the\ntraversals of the four Cluster spacecraft. The relative timing\nof the magnetopause crossings of spacecraft 1, 2, and 4 sug-\ngests that the boundary moved over the spacecraft with an\napproximately constant velocity component of \u223c25 km s\u22121\nin the inward normal direction (based upon the separation be-\ntween those satellites along the MVA-derived boundary nor-\nmal direction). Since Cluster 3 did not encounter the mag-\nnetopause until approximately four minutes after spacecraft\n1, 2, and 4, it would perhaps be unwise to base a further\nvelocity estimate on the four-spacecraft data set (e.g. using\nthe techniques described by Dunlop and Woodward, 1998,\nand references therein), as this would rely upon an assumed\nconstant orientation and continuation of the motion of the\nboundary. However, for completeness, we note that the three\nvelocity estimates relying on spacecraft 3 each indicate an in-\nward velocity of \u223c10 km s\u22121. In summary, the Cluster FGM\ndata reveal the inward motion of the magnetopause over the\nspacecraft at \u223c07:11 UT, the relative planarity of the bound-\nary over the inter-spacecraft separation scale (\u223c5000 km),\nand the approximate orientation of the outward boundary\nnormal direction.\nFigure 3 shows magnetic field data from all four Clus-\nter spacecraft presented in boundary normal coordinates be-\ntween 07:20\u201307:50 UT. This coordinate system is defined\nsuch that N is the estimated outward normal direction, L lies\nin the boundary and points north (such that the L-N plane\ncontains the GSM Z-axis), and M also lies in the boundary\nand points west, orthogonal to L and N (such that (L, M , N )\nforms a right-handed coordinate system). The uppermost\npanel of Fig. 3 shows the total magnetic field measured at\nall four spacecraft as a function of universal time, with the\ndata from each spacecraft colour-coded as indicated, while\nthe following three panels present the L, M , and N field\ncomponents. The corresponding components of the ion ve-\nlocity, the total ion velocity |V |, and the ion concentration are\npresented in the remaining five panels, respectively. In the\ncase of the plasma data, moments from CIS hot ion analyser\n(HIA) sensors on board Clusters 1 and 3 are presented. No\nCIS data were available from spacecraft 2, while measure-\nments from the Cluster 4 CIS ion COmposition and DIstribu-\ntion Function (CODIF) analyser indicated an unexpected but\nsizeable positive component of the flow normal to the local\nboundary orientation. We have attributed this inconsistency\nto a systematic offset between the velocities recorded by the\nCluster 1\/3 (HIA) and Cluster 4 (CODIF) CIS sensors (i.e. an\ninstrumental, rather than geophysical effect) and the Cluster\n4 data are therefore not presented. Simultaneous data from\nthe RAPID IES instrument (spacecraft 3 only) are compared\nto the magnetic field data in Fig. 4. The lower panel shows an\nenergy-time spectrogram of energetic electron flux in the 40\u2013\n110 keV range during the interval 07:20\u201307:50 UT (the same\nas in Fig. 3). The centre panel presents a time-series of flux\nin 52.7\u201370.3 keV range only. The upper panel shows the BN\ncomponent of the magnetic field data recorded at spacecraft\n3, as presented in Fig. 3.\nIn contrast to the Cluster spacecraft, which approached the\nhigh-latitude magnetopause on outbound trajectories, Geo-\ntail was located at much lower latitude in the post-noon sec-\ntor throughout the interval of interest. As indicated by the\nmagnetic field clock angle comparison presented in Fig. 2a,\nat the beginning of the interval Geotail (red dots) observed a\nmagnetic field clock angle of \u223c0\u25e6 (i.e. approximately north-\nward). This orientation was consistent with a low-latitude\nposition within the dayside magnetosphere, where the ex-\npected magnetospheric field points predominantly north-\nward, rather than a location in the magnetosheath (given\nthat the lagged ACE data at that time indicated a duskward\noriented IMF). At \u223c07:11 UT the spacecraft emerged into\nthe magnetosheath and the clock angle variations observed\nat Geotail began to match closely those seen at Cluster 1\nand ACE, and continued to do so until the end of the in-\nterval presented. We therefore conclude that following the\n07:11 UT magnetopause encounters, Geotail and all four\n450 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs\nFig. 3.

The lower panel presents\nan energy-time spectrogram of omni-directional electron flux over\nthe 40\u2013110 keV range, colour-coded as indicated. The centre panel\npresents a time-series in the 52.7\u201370.3 keV range. For comparison,\nthe upper panel shows the boundary-normal component of the mag-\nnetic field observed at the same spacecraft (as presented in Fig. 3).\nCluster spacecraft were situated in the magnetosheath, at low\nand high latitudes, respectively.\nFigure 5 presents magnetic field observations recorded\nby the Geotail MGF instrument during the interval 07:20\u2013\n07:50 UT (the same interval over which Cluster magnetic\nfield data is presented in Fig. 3). As in the case of the Cluster\nmeasurements, minimum variance analysis has been applied\nto the magnetic field data in order estimate the direction of\nthe outward pointing vector normal to the boundary, with the\ndata then being organised in boundary normal coordinates. In\nthis case, we have applied MVA during 07:11\u201307:13 UT, cor-\nresponding to the interval when Geotail emerged from a mag-\nnetospheric into a magnetosheath magnetic field configura-\ntion. This interval also corresponds to the outbound magne-\ntopause crossing observed by the Cluster spacecraft at higher\nlatitudes, presumably due to the global (inward) motion of\nthe magnetopause at that time. Minimum variance analy-\nsis yields a boundary normal vector with GSM components\n[+0.93, +0.05, \u22120.36], with the ratio of the intermediate to\nminimum eigenvalues of the covariance matrix being \u223c4.4.\nIn this case, the angular standard deviations of the minimum\nvariance direction either towards or away from the interme-\ndiate and maximum variance directions were \u223c10\u25e6 and \u223c1\u25e6,\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs 451\nrespectively. This uncertainty, while larger than in the cor-\nresponding Cluster MVA, remains acceptable. Furthermore,\nthe derived boundary normal direction, being predominantly\nsunward, with a small southward and almost no dawn-dusk\ncomponent, is entirely consistent with the expected outward\npointing direction of the magnetopause just southward of the\nsubsolar point. The arrangement of the panels in Fig. 5 is\nsimilar to those in Fig. 3, with the panels presenting (from\ntop to bottom) the total magnetic field strength, the L, M ,\nand N components of both the magnetic field and the ion\nvelocity, the total ion velocity, and the local plasma concen-\ntration.\n3.3 Signatures of magnetic reconnection\nDuring the interval 07:20 UT\u201307:50 UT, several (at least\nseven) large amplitude bipolar oscillations were observed by\nthe Cluster spacecraft, each usually associated with an en-\nhancement in the overall magnetic field strength and varia-\ntions in the magnetic field components in the plane of the\nmagnetopause. These signatures, examples of which oc-\ncurred at \u223c07:25, 07:28, 07:31, 07:33, 07:37, 07:39, and\n07:41 UT, were observed in the magnetosheath and set\nagainst a highly variable background magnetic field. The\napproximate timings of these features, defined by the local\npeaks in total magnetic field strength, are indicated by dashed\nlines in Fig. 3, labeled i\u2013vii, respectively. In general, we\nhave defined as possible FTE signatures those structures that\nexhibit significant enhancements in the total magnetic field\nstrength (above the background fluctuations in |B|) and iden-\ntifiable contemporaneous bipolar variations in the BN com-\nponent of the magnetic field. The peak-to-peak magnitude\nof the bipolar variations exceed 10 nT in each case (and ap-\nproached 50 nT in the 07:25 UT feature observed at Cluster\nspacecraft 1 and 3). As such, the bipolar variations indicated\nin the figure have peak-to-peak amplitudes in excess of the\n10 nT discriminator employed by Rijnbeek et al. (1984).\nThe simultaneous plasma measurements presented in\nFig. 3 are generally as expected for a location in the magne-\ntosheath exterior to the high-latitude post-noon sector mag-\nnetopause. The Cluster 1 and 3 observations are generally\nin excellent agreement throughout, indicating anti-sunward\nmagnetosheath flow dominated by components in the L and\n\u2212M directions. (of which the L component is larger). These\ndata therefore indicate flow in a predominantly northward\nand duskward direction. For most of the interval, the compo-\nnent of the flow normal to the boundary was significantly\nsmaller than the flow in the plane parallel to the magne-\ntopause. Given the highly variable nature of the magne-\ntosheath flow observed by the Cluster spacecraft, it is dif-\nficult to establish a one-to-one correlation with the possible\nFTE structures inferred from the magnetic field data. How-\never, in some cases there were indications of plasma varia-\ntions associated with the FTE magnetic field perturbations.\nNotable examples are the reduction in plasma density during\nFTE event i and enhancements within \u00b11 min of events v,\nvi, and vii observed at spacecraft 1 and 3 (each apparently\nFig. 5. Magnetic field and plasma observations from the Geotail\nspacecraft during the interval 07:20\u201307:50 UT on 17 February 2003\npresented in the same format as Fig. 3.\nassociated with burst of increased anti-sunward flow), al-\nthough we acknowledge that such interpretation is somewhat\nsubjective, given the variability of the data.\nExamination of the RAPID IES data from the Cluster 3\nspacecraft (which was located closest to the magnetopause\n452 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs\nFig. 6. (a) A comparison of |B| andBN measurements from Cluster\n3 and Geotail. FTEs identified previously are indicated by arrows,\nlabelled i\u2013vii (Cluster) and a\u2013d (Geotail) as in Figs. 3 and 5, respec-\ntively. (b) the same data as (a), but band-pass filtered in order to\nreveal the FTE signatures more clearly.\nduring this interval) indicated enhanced fluxes of energetic\nelectrons with the majority of the seven events identified\nfrom the magnetic field data. As shown in Fig. 4, the majority\nof the magnetic FTE signatures were closely associated with\na burst of electrons whose energies were typical of magneto-\nspheric particles. In each case, the observed electron flux was\naround two orders of magnitude lower than observed on the\nmagnetospheric side of the magnetopause earlier in the inter-\nval (not shown), as expected for FTEs in the magnetosheath\n(e.g. Daly and Keppler, 1982). A burst of energetic electrons\ncentred on \u223c07:21 UT was not accompanied by a signifi-\ncant magnetic perturbation. We suggest that this may be the\nfinal remnants of the magnetopause boundary layer associ-\nated with the outbound magnetopause crossing just prior to\nthe beginning of the interval included in this figure. We also\nnote that the final observation of significant fluxes of ener-\ngetic magnetospheric electrons coincided with the magnetic\nsignature of the penultimate FTE (vi). The final FTE (event\nvii) was not associated with a burst of energetic electrons.\nThis is most likely a consequence of the final FTE passing in\nclose proximity to the spacecraft, resulting in the observation\nof disturbed magnetosheath field lines draped over the open\nflux tube, but not actually penetrating the FTE (and therefore\nnot observing magnetospheric plasma).\nDuring this interval, the Geotail magnetic field measure-\nments, presented in Fig. 5, were also characterised by several\nlarge-amplitude, bipolar perturbations observed in the nor-\nmal component of the field. These perturbations were gen-\nerally associated with enhancements in the overall magnetic\nfield strength and variations in the direction of the field in the\nplane of the magnetopause. These are indicated in Fig. 5 by\ndashed vertical lines labelled a\u2013d. As was the case for similar\nobservations made by Cluster at higher latitudes, we interpret\nthese perturbations as the characteristic signatures of FTEs\nin the vicinity of the magnetopause. Once again, we note\nthat the differentiation of FTE signatures from \u201cbackground\u201d\nvariations in the magnetic field is not trivial. In particular, the\nenhancements in the overall magnetic field strength observed\nat Geotail are less clear than the equivalent features at Clus-\nter. However, for the examples indicated in Fig. 5, we have\nidentified features that exhibit a clear local peak in the total\nmagnetic field strength and a significant perturbation in the\nboundary normal component of the field. We acknowledge\nthat it is likely that we have identified only a subset of the\nFTE signatures embedded within the data. As with the FTEs\nobserved at much higher latitudes by Cluster, a variety of BN\ntype signatures are apparent.\nAs discussed in Sect. 3.2, appropriate Geotail plasma data\nwere only available for a fraction of the interval presented in\nFig. 5. These ion velocity moments indicate that during and\nimmediately following the 07:29 UT FTE (b), the flow speed\nwas \u223c150 km s\u22121, predominantly in the \u2212L (i.e. southward)\ndirection, as expected for a satellite located \u223c1.5RE south-\nward of the subsolar stagnation point. At approximately\n07:42 UT, during the final FTE candidate event, a burst\nof high-speed ion flow was observed. This \u223c300 km s\u22121\nflow burst, superimposed upon a background flow similar to\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs 453\nthat observed during event b, was mainly in the \u2212L (south-\nward) direction, although significant components in the \u2212M\n(duskward) and \u2212N (inward) directions were observed. Ion\ndensity measurements, where available, indicated density be-\ntween 10\u201315 cm\u22123 during both events.\n4 Discussion\nFigures 3, 4, and 5 present the field and particle signatures\nof flux transfer events in the vicinity of the dayside mag-\nnetopause observed by Cluster and Geotail, respectively. In\nboth cases, the signatures were embedded within a complex\nand highly-variable magnetosheath field and plasma environ-\nment. As such, we acknowledge that the list of FTEs identi-\nfied during this interval is unlikely to be exhaustive and that\nother, less well-defined events may have been overlooked.\nThis favourable conjunction of spacecraft has neverthless re-\nvealed the simultaneous signatures of magnetic reconnection\nat similar magnetic local times but at greatly seperated lati-\ntudes.\nFigure 6a presents an overview of the magnetic field sig-\nnatures of FTEs observed at Cluster and Geotail. The upper\npanel presents a comparison of the |B| time-series recorded\nby Cluster 3 and Geotail, respectively, while the lower panel\nshows the BN component of the field. We have chosen to\npresent data from Cluster 3, since during this period, it was\nthis spacecraft that was in closest proximity to the magne-\ntopause. The flux transfer events identified in Figs. 3, 4, and\n5 are indicated by arrows in each panel, employing the same\ni\u2013vii and a\u2013d labelling as previously. In order to substan-\ntiate our interpretation of the signatures and further investi-\ngate timing of the FTEs observed at each spacecraft, we shall\nfirst remove the low amplitude, high frequency perturbations\nfrom these time-series. Figure 6b therefore presents the same\ndata as Fig. 6a, but low-pass filtered in order to remove vari-\nations with periods less than 1 min. Furthermore, the |B|\ntime-series have also been highpass filtered to remove vari-\nations with periods greater than 20 min. As with all filtered\ndata, caution must be exercised such that any subsequent in-\nterpretation is not reliant upon features (or the lack thereof)\nthat may have been added (or removed) by the actual filtering\nprocess. However, in this case, the filtered data presented in\nFig. 6b are broadly speaking a faithful representation of the\nlarge-scale structure present in the unfiltered measurements.\nOnce again, we acknowledge that there may be further FTE\nsignatures in these time series, in addition to those labelled in\nFig. 6, but we shall not seek to define any further candidates\nat this stage.\nIt is clear that during this interval, the characteristic signa-\ntures of magnetic reconnection were observed contempora-\nneously in the magnetosheath, at both high and low latitudes\nduring a window of approximately 20 min in duration. More-\nover, the almost continuous train of FTEs appeared to cease\nsimultaneously at all five spacecraft. Given that such widely\nseparated multi-spacecraft observations are somewhat rare,\nwe therefore consider what the observations reveal regarding\nthe location of the reconnection site during the interval pre-\nsented. In order to study these signatures in a quantitative\nfashion, we have employed a realistic model of open flux\ntube motion based on that of Cooling et al. (2001) to in-\nvestigate the motion of newly-reconnected flux tubes over\nthe dayside magnetopause (subsequently referred to as \u201cthe\nCooling model\u201d). Whilst a detailed description of this model\nis not appropriate here, we shall outline the basic elements of\nour implementation. This simple model, an evolution of the\nmodel of Cowley and Owen (1989), considers the draping\nand strength of the magnetosheath magnetic field, magne-\ntosheath flow velocity, and density over the surface of a sim-\nple paraboloid magnetopause, based upon the models of Ko-\nbel and Flu\u00a8ckiger (1994) and Spreiter et al. (1966). In the un-\nmodified Cooling model, a test for steady-state reconnection\nbetween the magnetosheath and magnetospheric field (which\nis everywhere constrained to lie parallel to the magnetopause\nand point away\/toward the southern\/northern cusp) may be\napplied at any point on the surface of the magnetopause. This\neffectively compares the mean current density in the magne-\ntopause current sheet with some arbitrary threshold value,\nallowing reconnection to occur if the mean current exceeds\nthe threshold. If reconnection is permitted, a reconnection\nX line of fixed length is constructed in the direction of the\nmerging current calculated at the reconnection site. The in-\nstantaneous flux tube motion along the magnetopause due to\nthe effects of stress balance in the reconnected flux tubes and\nmagnetosheath flow, at the so-called de Hoffman-Teller ve-\nlocity (de Hoffman and Teller, 1950), is then calculated, as\nindicated in Fig. 7a. The subsequent motion of reconnected\nflux tubes is then traced, via iteration, over the surface of\nthe magnetopause and into the magnetotail from several lo-\ncations on the X line.\nIn our modified implementation of the model, the steady-\nstate reconnection test is not applied. Instead, we are able to\nmonitor the subsequent motion of the reconnected flux tubes\n(i.e. FTEs) away from a user-defined reconnection site (i.e.\nforegoing the reconnection test). By doing this, we are able\nto compare the expected flux tube motion with the observed\nFTE signatures without constraining the location of the re-\nconnection site, using an assumed threshold to the reconnec-\ntion process. Furthermore, rather than imposing a particu-\nlar X line orientation, we simply trace the flux tube motion\nfrom several point-like reconnection sites in order to mimic\nthe effects of a spatially extended X line (for a discussion of\nreconnection site location and X-line geometry modelling,\nthe reader is directed to Moore et al., 2002, and references\ntherein).\nIn the first instance, we shall investigate the FTE signa-\ntures observed at Cluster and Geotail at \u223c07:25 UT (events\ni and a, respectively). Given that this was the first mag-\nnetosheath FTE observed, that the signature was distinct\nat all spacecraft, and coming some three minutes after the\nlagged upstream IMF observations indicated a reorientation\nto \u223c180\u25e6 clock angle, it is possible that in this case the\nnear-simultaneous observations made at widely separated lo-\ncations are consequences of the same reconnection event.\n454 J.

In this case the magnetosheath and geomagnetic field vectors (Bms and Bgm, respectively) are indicated\nin the top right corner. The magnetosheath flow in the Earth\u2019s rest frame, V SH , is indicated by the dot-dashed line. Following reconnection,\na pair of open flux tubes is formed, connected to the northern and Southern Hemisphere cusps, respectively. In the rest frame of each\nreconnected flux tube (i.e. the de Hoffman-Teller frames), which have origins OHTN and OHT S , respectively, the magnetosheath flow\nappears as a field-aligned flow at the Alfve\u00b4n speed. In the case of the flux tube anchored to the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere cusp,\nthis is indicated by the solid (dashed) arrow labelled VAbms (\u2212VAbms ). Consequently, the instantaneous velocies of the flux tubes (at\nthe de Hoffman-Teller velocity) can be constructed as indicated by the dotted vectors marked VHTN and VHT S , respectively. Plasma in\nthe magnetospheric boundary layer is also moving at the Alfve\u00b4n speed along the geomagnetic field line in the de Hoffman-Teller frame,\nindicated by vectors labelled VAbgm and \u2212VAbgm, respectively. (b) The equivalent velocity space diagram for an open flux tube anchored\nin the Northern Hemisphere cusp, in the vicinity of the Cluster spacecraft at \u223c07:35 UT, as described in the text. In this case, the draped\nmagnetosheath field is oriented predominantly in the duskward direction. The field-aligned magnetosheath flow in the rest frame of the\nflux tube (VAbms ), while smaller in magnitude than the predominantly northward directed super-Alfve\u00b4nic magnetosheath flow (V SH ),\ncontains a larger component in the dawn-dusk direction. The resulting motion of the flux tube, at the de Hoffman-Teller velocity (VHTN ),\nis predominantly northward with a small dawnward component.\nFigure 8a presents results of the Cooling model that sup-\nport this inference. This figure shows a view of the day-\nside magnetopause in the GSM Y-Z plane as viewed from\nthe Sun. The concentric dotted circles indicate the magne-\ntopause in the GSM Y-Z plane at X positions of X=+5RE ,\n0RE , \u22125RE , and \u221210RE while the cusps are represented\nby the diamond symbol. In this model, the cusps are po-\nsitioned at the GSM locations (0.5RMP , 0, \u00b1RMP ), where\nRMP is the radius of the model magnetopause at the subso-\nlar point. In this case, RMP has been set to 10RE , roughly\nthe value predicted by the model of Shue et al. (1997) dur-\ning this interval. At 07:22 UT, just prior to the FTE obser-\nvations at the spacecraft, the lagged IMF had GSM compo-\nnents (\u22123.6 nT, \u22120.5 nT,\u22125.0 nT), i.e. southward but with a\nsubstantial earthward component. The resulting IMF clock\nangle is indicated in the upper right-hand corner of Fig. 8a.\nIn this case, the initial reconnection site was positioned\njust poleward of the subsolar point at GSM coordinates\n(+9.9RE , 0RE , +1RE), where a large shear between the\ndraped magnetosheath and geomagnetic fields was expected\n(indicated by a red cross in the figure). Open flux tubes were\nthen tracked (forwards in time) from this point over an inter-\nval of six minutes. The motion of open flux tubes anchored\nin the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere is thus indicated by\nthe dashed (solid) trace. Similarly, open flux tubes were\ntraced from two additional locations, displaced 1 and 2RE\nduskward of the original point, respectively. For compari-\nson, the positions of the four Cluster spacecraft (indicated by\nthe filled circles, colour-coded as in Fig. 1) and Geotail (indi-\ncated by the filled black circle) at 07:25 UT are also included.\nClearly, an azimuthally extended X line that includes (but\nis not limited to) the points indicated by red crosses in Fig. 8a\nresults in open flux tubes that move (under the effects of the\nmagnetic tension force and magnetosheath flow) during the\nfew (\u223c3) minutes after reconnection, over the locations of\nthe Cluster and Geotail spacecraft. In this example, the flux\ntubes connected to the Southern Hemisphere arrive at Geotail\nslightly (\u223c90 s) before the corresponding Northern Hemi-\nsphere flux tubes arrive at Cluster, as was the case for the\ni\/a pair of events indicated in Fig. 6. This is a consequence of\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs 455\nFig. 8. The simulated path of open magnetic flux tubes over magnetopause derived from the Cooling model. Each panel represents the\ndayside magnetopause as viewed from the Sun for the IMF direction indicated in the upper right corner. Concentric dotted circles indicate the\nradius of the magnetopause in the X=+5, 0, \u22125, and \u221210RE planes while the location of the cusps are indicated by the diamond symbols.\nIn each panel, reconnection has been initiated at locations indicated by the red crosses. Flux tubes anchored in both the northern (dashed\nlines) and Southern Hemisphere (solid lines) are traced over 6-min intervals. The Cluster and Geotail spacecraft are indicated by the filled\ncircles, colour-coded as in Fig. 1. The FTE velocity in the Northern Hemisphere, based on multi-spacecraft observations and the estimated\nopen flux tube velocity yielded by the Cooling model, are indicated by the green and black vectors, respectively (scale: 1RE=100 km s\u22121).\nour choice of positive ZGSM locations for the reconnection\nsites, although we note that this effect is relatively insensi-\ntive to small changes in the orientation of our notional X line\n(suggesting that the simulation results are stable, rather than\ncontrived). We emphasise that the reconnection sites pre-\nsented here have been selected, following multiple runs of the\nmodel, in order to give good agreement with the timing of the\nobserved FTE signatures. Larger scale (\u223cRE) changes to the\nlocation of the postulated X line resulted in flux tube motion\ninconsistent with the observation of FTEs at both Cluster and\nGeotail. The Cooling model is therefore able to reproduce\nthe timing of the FTEs observed in this case with surprising\naccuracy, assuming that reconnection occurs simultaneously\nover the whole of the X line.\nFurthermore, the model estimates that by the time they\nreached the approximate location of the Cluster space-\ncraft, the flux tubes were moving along the surface of\nthe magnetopause at \u223c400 km s\u22121 with GSM compo-\nnents (\u2212270 km s\u22121, +93 km s\u22121, +286 km s\u22121). This mo-\ntion, at the de Hoffman-Teller velocity, compares favourably\nwith the estimated speed of the FTE obtained by compar-\ning the arrival time of specific, identifiable features within\nthe magnetic field data observed by the four, spatially dis-\nplaced spacecraft. When high resolution FGM data are\nexamined in detail (not shown), the positive edge of the\npositive-to-negative bipolar signature (event i) takes \u223c15 s\nto convect across all four spacecraft. Assuming that the\nleading edge of FTE structure was planar, constrained to\nmove in the plane of the magnetopause, and travelled\nat approximately constant velocity over the tetrahedron,\nanalysis of the multi-spacecraft timing information reveals\nthat the propagation speed of the structure normal to the\nFTE \u201cfront\u201d was \u223c380 km s\u22121, with GSM components\n(\u2212229 km s\u22121, +79 km s\u22121, +295 km s\u22121). For compari-\nson, the Cooling model flux tube velocity vector in the vicin-\nity of Cluster, and the FTE convection velocity vector based\nupon the multi-spacecraft observations are superimposed on\nFig. 8a, coloured black and green, respectively. Noting that\nat the spacecraft which observed the largest (and longest last-\ning) bipolar fluctuation (Cluster 3), the structure took \u223c40 s\nto pass over the spacecraft (peak-to-peak), we infer a scale\nsize of\u223c2RE in the direction of motion. As a further indica-\ntion of the robustness of the model, we note that the average\nion velocity directions measured at Cluster during 20-s win-\ndows centred on the FTE were broadly consistent with the\ndirection of motion of flux tubes predicted by the Cooling\nmodel. During the event, the three Cluster spacecraft with\noperating particle detectors observed a region of depleted ion\ndensity during the passage of the FTE which corresponded to\na region of suppressed ion velocity.\nFollowing the first \u201cpair\u201d of FTEs, the assignment of fur-\nther corresponding pairs of signatures becomes increasingly\nsubjective due to the relative short inter-FTE period (\u223c few\nminutes at Cluster). However, we shall briefly investigate\nthe sequence of FTEs observed by Cluster and Geotail after\n\u223c07:32 UT (i.e. the latter portion of the interval presented\nin Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 6). During these events, the period\nof the BN component fluctuations observed at Cluster was\n456 J. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs\ncomparable to the inter-event period (\u223c2\u20133 min). Whilst the\ntwo events identified at Geotail are separated by a longer in-\nterval, examination of the noisy magnetic field data suggest\nthat it is highly likely that further FTEs (below the thresh-\nold of objective discrimination) occur between events c and\nd. Consequently, it is all but impossible to delimit individual\nevents or confidently ascertain the correspondence of events\nbetween Cluster and Geotail. We note that during this in-\nterval, the rate at which FTEs were observed was within the\nrange of repetition times reported by Lockwood and Wild\n(1993). Given the reduced IMF clock angle during this pe-\nriod a slight (\u223c0.5RE) equatorward displacement and az-\nimuthal extension of the X line was required in order produce\nopen flux tubes that propagated over the locations of Cluster\nand Geotail (Fig. 8b). In this case, by the time it arrived\nat Cluster, the northward and duskward motion of the mod-\nelled open flux tube had evolved into northward and slightly\ndawnward motion. As indicated in Fig. 7b, this motion was a\nconsequence of the predominantly duskward pointing draped\nmagnetosheath field at this location. The duskward compo-\nnent of the super-Alfve\u00b4nic magnetosheath flow at this posi-\ntion was slightly smaller than the duskward component of\nthe field-aligned magnetsheath flow in the rest frame of the\nflux tube (a consequence of the magnetosheath flow model\nemployed). Consequently, in the rest frame of the Earth, the\nflux tube exhibited a poleward and slightly dawnward mo-\ntion. Detailed examination of the Cluster magnetometer data\nduring the final event (vii) indicates that the ordering of the\nobserved structure as it passed over the spacecraft was once\nagain in concordance with the northward and duskward mo-\ntion of a planar structure moving at \u223c305 km s\u22121. The du-\nration of the events observed at the Cluster spacecraft were\nsimilar to those in the earlier interval (\u223c40 s), indicating a\nscale size \u223c2RE . This is supported by the fact that all four\nspacecraft observed similar amplitude signatures, implying\na lower limit for the spatial scale of the order of the space-\ncraft separation (\u223c5000 km). As indicated in Fig. 8b, the\nobserved flux tube motion is consistent with the Cooling\nestimate of the flux tube\u2019s speed in the vicinity of Cluster\n(\u223c297 km s\u22121). However, the predicted direction of propa-\ngation was not as accurate as in the previous case (the differ-\nence in this case between prediction and observation being\n\u223c30\u25e6 in the plane of the model magnetopause). Investiga-\ntion of the model indicates that under such BY dominant IMF\nconditions, the dawnward motion of flux tubes in the high-\nlatitude post-noon sector is not uncommon. The discrepancy\nbetween the predicted flux tube motion and that inferred from\nmulti-spacecraft data (which in this case appears to be rea-\nsonable) is an intrinsic effect of the simple geomagnetic and\nmagnetosheath field, and magnetosheath plasma models re-\nlied upon by the Cooling technique.\nIt is also worthwhile considering the polarity of the FTE\nsignatures presented here. At Cluster, located in the high-\nlatitude Northern Hemisphere magnetosheath, event i was\na clear example of a normal polarity bipolar perturbation\nwhilst events ii\u2013vii were less clear cut: depending upon the\ndefinition of the FTE timing they could be interpreted as\neither normal or reverse polarity. However, we infer the\nbipolar FTE signatures to be of the normal polarity based\nupon the FTE timings derived from energetic electron obser-\nvations. We note that this is consistent with the high-latitude\nposition on the spacecraft (as suggested by previous stud-\nies, e.g. Berchem and Russell, 1984; Rijnbeek et al., 1984;\nKawano et al., 1992; Russell et al., 1996). The simultaneous\nGeotail measurements, made slightly southward of the equa-\ntor, present a complex scenario: event a is distinctly asym-\nmetric and best classified as \u201cirregular\u201d while event b is of\nthe reverse polarity. At first inspection events c and d appear\nto be of normal polarity, although this interpretation is by no\nmeans clear-cut. Without clearer |B| signatures, or reliable\nplasma data, it is not possible to determine the polarity of\nthese fluctuations with absolute certainty.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nWe have presented in-situ observations of the signatures\nof FTEs at multiple positions in the magnetosheath during\nthe interval 07:20\u201307:50 UT on 17 February 2003. During\nthis time, the Cluster spacecraft were located in the mag-\nnetosheath, moving away from the high-latitude post-noon\nsector magnetopause. At the same time, Geotail was located\nin near-noon sector, at equatorial latitudes in the Southern\nHemisphere. The FTE signatures observed by Cluster and\nGeotail were principally characterised by bipolar perturba-\ntions in the magnetic field component in the direction normal\nto the magnetopause and enhancements in the overall mag-\nnetic field strength. This was consistent with the expected\nenhanced rate of dayside reconnection resulting from the pre-\nvailing IMF orientation at the time, namely southward and\nduskward.\nOur comparison of the field and particle signatures ob-\nserved at high and low latitudes, using multi-point Cluster\ndata wherever possible, has enabled us to infer the scale\nand motion of the FTEs. A modified implementation of\nthe flux tube model of Cooling et al. (2001) has been em-\nployed in order to investigate the expected time of arrival\nand direction of motion of open flux tubes (FTEs) at the lo-\ncations of Cluster and Geotail. For the first FTE signatures\nobserved at the spacecraft, simulations were able to repro-\nduce the measured propagation delay with considerable ac-\ncuracy, suggesting that reconnection may have been initiated\nalmost simultaneously along an X line located slightly pole-\nward of the equatorial plane and extending at least \u223c3RE\nin length in the azimuthal direction. The predicted north-\nward evolution of reconnected flux tubes anchored in the\nNorthern Hemisphere resulted in them passing over the lo-\ncations of the Cluster satellites, and was entirely consistent\nwith the observation of normal polarity FTE signatures by\neach spacecraft. Similarly, the estimated southward evo-\nlution of reconnected flux tubes anchored in the Southern\nHemisphere passed over the location of Geotail (although\nin this case an irregular FTE signature was observed by the\nspacecraft). The convection speed and direction of the FTE\nJ. A. Wild et al.: Cluster and Geotail observations of FTEs 457\nstructure, inferred from the multi-spacecraft measurements\nmade by Cluster (\u223c400 km s\u22121 in the predominantly tailward\nand duskward direction), was in general agreement with the\nestimated speed and direction of the flux tubes at the location\nof Cluster yielded by the model. If propagating at this speed,\nthe duration of the Cluster observations suggest the scale size\nof the FTE to be \u223c2RE in the direction of motion. An irreg-\nular, asymmetric perturbation observed at Geotail was also\ninferred to be the consequence of an open flux tube anchored\nin the Southern Hemisphere given the good agreement be-\ntween the estimated propagation direction and the observed\nion flow, and the inferred position of the X line required to\ninitiate the propagation of northward moving FTEs consis-\ntent with those observed at Cluster. We note that this depar-\nture from the expected reverse polarity signature is in keep-\ning with the observations of Daly et al. (1984), who demon-\nstrated southward moving flux tubes may give rise to signa-\ntures other than the expected \u201cnormal\u201d polarity under certain\ncircumstances and Sanny et al. (1998), who proposed that\nFTEs formed at an equatorial X line emerge with strongly\nasymmetric signatures which evolve into the familiar bipolar\nsignature at increasing distances from the X line.\nThe train of FTEs observed by both Cluster and Geotail\nduring the latter part of the interval under scrutiny was more\ndifficult to classify in terms of normal or reverse polarity sig-\nnatures due to the rapid repetition rate of the FTEs. How-\never, as with the earlier events, consideration of the expected\nevolution of newly-reconnected flux tubes via the model of\nCooling et al. (2001) indicates that the FTEs were not incon-\nsistent with a low-latitude X line extending at least several\nRE in azimuth. Furthermore, as in the earlier cases, the esti-\nmated propagation velocity of FTE structures based on multi-\nspacecraft observations is in excellent agreement with the\nopen flux tube propagation velocity predicted by the Cool-\ning model. The duration of the FTE signatures during these\nevents also indicates a scale-size of\u223c2RE in the direction of\nmotion.\nIn effect, during the interval presented, we have utilised\nthe multi-point observations (over multiple scale lengths) in\norder to constrain the inferred location of the reconnection\nregion. By employing a simple model of flux tube motion\nin the magnetosheath, we have suggested a possible source\nregion of the FTEs observed by the five spacecraft em-\nployed in this study. It is interesting to note that without,\nfor instance, the Geotail data, we might have suggested\nmany reconnection configurations that would have resulted\nin the Cluster observations of FTEs in the high-latitude\npost-noon sector (or vice versa). However, the provision of\nobservations at both high and low latitudes has in this case\nconstrained the reconnection site to lie at near equatorial\nlatitudes. However, the complexity of the FTE signatures\nobserved during this interval has, in most cases, frustrated\nattempts to identify any pairing between the events observed\nat Cluster and Geotail. We anticipate that the advent of the\nCluster\/DoubleStar programme will yield many favourable\nconjunctions suitable for investigation by a similar technique.\nGiven the renewal of interest in large separation in-situ in-\nvestigations prompted by the Cluster and DoubleStar com-\npanion missions, and the current and unprecedented level of\nground\/space based coordination, we expect investigations\nsuch as this to incorporate ground-based data in the future.\nIndeed, ground-based data would have proven invaluable in\nthis analysis since the ionosphere signatures of reconnec-\ntion can reveal a great deal regarding reconnection processes\nover a significant fraction of the dayside magnetopause, and\nwould have provided an additional foothold in the interpre-\ntation of the different signatures of magnetic reconnection at\nwidely separated latitudes.\nAcknowledgements.
