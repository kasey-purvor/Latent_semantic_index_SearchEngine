But even if it is\nassociated with the\n \n \n \n\u201cinscrutable\u201d sovereign, pardon remains a right because it\ninterferes with the normal workings of the law. I can\n \n \n \n\u201cforgive\u201d my debtors\nbecause no public law requires me to collect my dues, but a transgression\nagainst the law cannot be forgiven, only pardoned.\nNevertheless, this thoroughly juridified notion of pardon can only find\nmeaning on the fringes of law as a tangent in relation to forgiveness, and this\nis why pardon presents a problem for the systematized account of legal con-\ncepts that Kant is so obsessed with. For as soon as the legal concept of pardon\ntouches upon forgiveness, it must by necessity also compromise its conceptual\npurity. One could, then, claim that Kant\u2019s treatment of pardon is short, not\nbecause it is unimportant, but because with brevity Kant wishes to avoid the\nentanglements that would arise if he associated the legal concept too closely\nwith forgiveness. Even language betrays him. The German word for pardon,\n \nBegnadigung\n \n, implies a \u201cgift of grace,\u201d a \n \ngratia\n \n that, as Augustine would say, is\nnot granted for merits but is, by definition, given free (\n \ngratis\n \n).\n \n3\n \n So while the\nsovereign grants pardon \u201cat his pleasure,\u201d forgiveness expects nothing in\nreturn. Because it is endowed unilaterally with no requirement for reciprocity,\nforgiveness presents a threat to the working of the law. Vladimir Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch\ndescribes this threat thus:\n \nThe law [\n \ndroit\n \n] continuously codifies and encompasses the gracious movement\nof forgiveness, and forgiveness continuously escapes beyond the limits within\nwhich a massive codex claims to contain it. Refusing to be merely a postscript to\nwritten law or a case law of justice, forgiveness is for law [\n \nloi\n \n] a principle of\nmobility and fluidity: through the grace of forgiveness, this law remains pneu-\nmatic, evasive and approximate.\n \n4\n \nEven so, law ceaselessly approaches forgiveness in its attempts to rectify\nits own formal barrenness.

If forgiveness corrupts the\nconceptual and formal purity of law, in truth commissions it is \u201cpure\u201d forgive-\nness that is corrupted when it takes on pseudo-legal forms. The oft-cited apo-\nria\n \n \n \n\u201cforgiveness only forgives the unforgivable\u201d that Jacques Derrida adopts\nfrom Jank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch contrasts a conditional forgiveness requiring an economy\nof atonement with an unconditional and \u201cpure\u201d one, a\n \n \u201c\n \ngracious, infinite and\nnon-calculative forgiveness that is granted to the \n \nguilty as guilty\n \n, even to those\nwho do not repent or ask for it.\u201d\n \n5\n \n Even if forgiveness must always go beyond\na mere\n \n \n \n\u201ctherapy of reconciliation,\u201d Derrida insists that the opposing poles of\nthe conditional and unconditional must by necessity remain coupled:\n \nThe unconditional and the conditional are, no doubt, absolutely \n \nheterogeneous\n \n,\nforever, two sides of a limit, but they are also \n \nindissociable\n \n. In the movement or\nmotion of unconditional forgiveness there is an internal necessity to become\neffective, manifest, determined, and by determining itself to fold towards the\nconditional.\n \n6\n \nBut Derrida also leaves this necessity dependent on a will:\n \nif one wants [\n \nsi l\u2019on veut\n \n], and one should do so, forgiveness to be effective, con-\ncrete, historical, if one wants it to \n \narrive\n \n, to take place by changing things, its\npurity has to engage itself in a series of all kinds (psycho-sociological, political,\netc.). It is between these two poles [PM: of the unconditional and the condi-\ntional], \n \nirreconcilable but indissociable\n \n, that decisions and responsibilities are to\nbe taken.\n \n7\n \n\u201cTrue\u201d forgiveness that can only forgive the unforgivable must then\nengage with practices that permit forgiveness to take place historically\n \n \n \n\u201cif one\nwants,\u201d and\n \n \n \n\u201cone should want to do so.\u201d Whose will are we talking about? As\nfar as the atrocities committed are concerned, only the victim can truly for-\ngive.

Men are never equal in their ability\nto produces effects in the world. The weak and feeble, whatever the source of\nthat weakness may be, lack the ability to purge themselves by either retaliating\nor forgiving the injuries afflicted by their persecutors. Instead, the slave bears\na grudge and holds on to his resentful feelings. In other words, \n \nressentiment\n \n is\na will to power that cannot be acted upon. But the slave also attaches positive\nmoral values to the powerlessness that prevents him from acting by settling\nfor an imaginary surrogate in exchange for a promise of a life after. The\nslave\u2019s imaginary revenge, never put into effect but sustained in his memory,\nis a reactive gesture founded on a negative validation of the other and of the\noutside world.\n \n \n \n\u201cI am not you,\u201d the man of \n \nressentiment\n \n keeps repeating never\nbeing able to affirm what he truly is.\nEventually \n \nressentiment\n \n finds expression in self-righteous Christian values:\n \npowerlessness which does not retaliate is being falsified into\n \n \n \n\u201cgoodness,\u201d\nanxious baseness into\n \n \n \n\u201chumility,\u201d submission before those one hates to\n\u201cobedience\u201d (of course, obedience to the one who, they say, commands this\nsubmission\u2014they call him God).

It is a set of reactive forces that ultimately triumph\nover noble active forces for the very reason that they do not \u201cre-act\u201d to them\nbut become\n \n \n \n\u201csensed\u201d (\n \nsenti\n \n).\n \n16\n \n If, for Nietzsche, noble morality expresses\nitself through the ability to forget, Deleuze\u2019s man of \n \nressentiment\n \n is tormented\nby his memory.

And it is by evading the action of\nactive forces that gives revenge the\n \n \n \n\u201cresentful\u201d means of reversing the relation\nbetween active and reactive forces and thus constitutes the slave\u2019s triumphant\nrevolt:\n \nRessentiment\n \n is the triumph of the weak as weak, the revolt of the slaves and\ntheir victory as slaves.

Deleuze calls this the fiction of a force sepa-\nrated from what it can do:\nIt is thanks to this fiction that reactive forces triumph. It is, in fact, not sufficient\nfor them to refrain from activity. They must also reverse the relation of forces,\nthey must oppose themselves to active forces and represent themselves as supe-\nrior. The process of accusation in ressentiment fulfils this task: reactive forces\n\u201cproject\u201d an abstract and neutralized image of force. Such a force detached\nfrom its effects will be guilty if it acts, worthy, on the contrary, if it does not. . . .19\nBut reaction always turns back on itself, and ressentiment is eventually\ninternalized as bad conscience, as a conscience that produces pain by internal-\nizing force:\nressentiment is only appeased once its contagion is spread. Its aim is for all life to\nbecome reactive, for those in good health to become sick. It is not enough for it\nto accuse, the accused must feel guilty. And it is in bad conscience that ressenti-\nment comes into its own and reaches the summit of its contagious power: it\nchanges direction. It\u2019s my fault, it\u2019s my fault, until the whole world takes up this\ndreary refrain, until everything active in life develops this same feeling of\nguilt.20\nFor Nietzsche (and for Deleuze), the resentful victim would then be some-\none who, due to an innate weakness, is unable to act upon the injuries he has\nsuffered. At the outset, he seems to have three options for action. He can retal-\niate, which would imply a swift and active reply more or less immediately\nafter the injury has occurred, or he can magnanimously forgive. Or, finally, he\ncan simply actively disregard his persecutor. All options imply a purging or\ncathartic effect, i.e., a curative power that is characteristic of the noble. The\nman of ressentiment, on the other hand, holds on to his initial suffering through\nmemory because no cathartic healing is either sought or achieved. Ressenti-\nment is, then, a temporal prolongation of the victim\u2019s suffering that both arises\nfrom a particular morality and further contributes to it. This morality is\nmerely reactive, never affirmative. It can only validate itself as the lack of\nsomething else, as the absence of an \u201cevil\u201d will to power. It detaches power\nfrom the results it produces and justifies its aversion to the former through a\ndevaluation of the latter.\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 519  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n520\nLaw & L i terature \u2022  Volume 19,  Number  3\nR E S S E N T I M E N T  A N D  R E P R E S S I O N\nFrom Nietzsche\u2019s resentful \u201cslave\u201d morality and the \u201cnoble\u201d morality of the\nwill to power, Max Scheler develops a more detailed phenomenology of res-\nsentiment as a corrupt bourgeois ethos.21 Scheler disagrees about the origins of\nressentiment and claims that true Christian love is a \u201cblissful stooping\u201d that\nrequires an abundance of power and nobility. The very idea of Christian love\nis, however, easily usurped by ressentiment by simulating emotions that corre-\nspond to the idea of love. For Scheler, the origin of ressentiment lies in the\nbourgeois forms of Christian love that he calls \u201caltruism\u201d and \u201chumanitarian\nlove\u201d:\nIt [PM: modern humanitarian love] is not the personal act of love from man to\nman but, rather, primarily the postulation and evaluation of an impersonal\n\u201cinstitution,\u201d an institution of welfare. The Samaritan act does not arise from\nthe exuberance of life that bestows blissfully from its abundance and plenitude,\nlovingly from its inner preparedness and security. It arises from a contagious\ninvolvement with a feeling of depression that is manifest in apparent external\nexpressions of anguish and dearth, from a specifically modern \u201csham pity\u201d and\n\u201csympathy.\u201d22\nScheler depicts ressentiment as a lasting mental attitude that arises from the\nsystematic repression of negative emotions and sentiments such as revenge,\nhatred and malice that, as such, would otherwise be normal aspects of human\nlife. But the repression of these sentiments will eventually lead to a constant\ntendency to indulge in value delusions and corresponding illusory judgments.\nThe desire for revenge, i.e., a reactive impulse following an injury or an\nattack, is the most important source of ressentiment. The desire for revenge dif-\nfers from an act of reprisal because the immediate reactive impulse is post-\nponed to a future time that is deemed to be more appropriate. Postponing the\nimpulse suggests a pronounced sense of powerlessness and a corresponding\nself-valuation that assigns the deferral of the retaliatory reaction to a weakness\nor a character flaw in oneself. In addition to the postponement of the reaction,\nthe desire for revenge also includes a conscious conviction that a suffered\ninjury requires an equivalent talionic return given measure for measure.23\nSo in order for the desire for revenge to develop into a more permanent ressen-\ntiment, a particular qualification is needed:\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 520  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n521\nMinkkinen \u2022  Ressent iment  as  Suf fer ing\nRevenge, envy, the impulse to detract, spite, Schadenfreude, and malice lead to\nressentiment only if there occurs neither a moral self-conquest (such as, e.g., gen-\nuine forgiveness in the case of revenge) nor an act of some other adequate\nexpression of emotion, e.g., verbal abuse, shaking one\u2019s fist, etc., and if this\nrestraint is caused by a pronounced awareness of impotence. . . . It [PM: ressenti-\nment] can arise only on the condition that these sentiments are particularly pow-\nerful and are coupled with a feeling of impotence and one must, accordingly,\n\u201csuppress\u201d the acts\u2014either because of physical or psychological weakness,\nbecause of fear or anxiety.24\nScheler notes that two particularities should be observed in the repression\n(Verdr\u00e4ngung) of negative emotions. First, the man of ressentiment does not\nrepress the expression of his negative sentiments. The repression of an expres-\nsion would require conscious moral action that the man of ressentiment is by\ndefinition incapable of. In order to come to terms with his inability, he must\nrepress his whole negative impulse, thus detaching his sentiment from any par-\nticular individual or incident that may originally have prompted it. Having\ndone so, the man of ressentiment generalizes his negative sentiment so that it\ncan embrace any qualities that were, perhaps, originally associated with a sin-\ngular individual or incident\u2014i.e., the source of his injury\u2014but that he now\nidentifies everywhere. Second, repression also has an effect on the sentiment\nthat the man of ressentiment is unable to externalize as action. Because the neg-\native sentiment can find no clear external object, the man of ressentiment inter-\nnalizes it transforming it into self-hatred.25\nBut there is a further social factor that contributes to the development of\nressentiment. Scheler claims that the Western ethos of equality that does not\nrecognize differences in power falsely asserts that individuals have a \u201cright\u201d\nto be comparable with others even if this is factually impossible. Such a\n\u201cright\u201d creates false expectations, impossible moral demands in so far as they\ncan never be fulfilled.26 Moreover, the more the injury suffered mutates into a\nsense of permanency\u2014even a fatality\u2014the less likely any practical transfor-\nmation of the situation becomes. Eventually this leads to what Scheler\ndescribes as \u201caimless criticism,\u201d an \u201caversion from power\u201d that does not even\nexpect its demands to be fulfilled but, rather, uses the evil it criticizes as a pre-\ntext for its own continued existence.27\nRessentiment is sustained through permanent comparison.

Unlike\nthe noble and the powerful, the man of ressentiment validates himself and his\npredicament only as measurable comparisons in relation to others: \u201cmore\u201d or\n\u201cless,\u201d  \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse,\u201d  \u201cbigger\u201d or \u201csmaller.\u201d This is the basic attribute\nof what Scheler describes as a careerist upstart or an arriviste (Streber). But if\nthe mentality of relative values is coupled with a sense of impotence that\nwould prevent the common man from actively pursuing his careerist goals,\nthen the comparative tension demanding relief can only find recourse in a\ndelusion of values. And ressentiment provides this delusion:\nThe sense of superiority or equality that the \u201ccommon man\u201d seeks in order to\nrelieve the tension is here achieved by an illusory devaluation of the valuable\ncharacteristics of the comparable object or by a specific \u201cblindness\u201d in relation\nto them; but secondly\u2014and herein lies the main achievement of ressentiment\u2014\nby an illusory falsification of the values themselves that in general confer positive\nvalues and worthy attributes to the existence and validity of possible compara-\nble objects.28\nSo how would Scheler understand the resentful victim? Although he dis-\nagrees about its genealogical origins, Scheler does, however, restate many of\nthe key characteristics of ressentiment that Nietzsche had already outlined.\nRessentiment involves the postponement of an act of retaliation or an inability\nto forgive, both accompanied by a strong sense of impotence. Accordingly,\nressentiment once again involves the prolongation of the victim\u2019s suffering. But\nScheler is clearly more sensitive to the psycho-social mechanisms involved.\nThe resentful victim does not merely suppress a retaliatory response but,\nindeed, he represses the source of his negative sentiment into the unconscious\nand thus transforms his ressentiment into a symptom. Once the unconscious\norigin and the conscious symptom have been dissociated, the negative senti-\nment demands a continuous\u2014and futile\u2014search for alternative origins. This\nexplains the \u201ccontagious\u201d nature of ressentiment. And further, because the vic-\ntim\u2019s attempts to externalize an unconscious origin are futile, the negative ten-\nsion must eventually backfire. Scheler, then, sees ressentiment as a form of\nwhat one could call \u201cmoral neurosis.\u201d\nBut Scheler also seems to find a kinship of sorts between the injured vic-\ntim\u2019s ressentiment and the general expressions of empathy with which society\nat large addresses his suffering. Scheler\u2019s sharp criticism of liberal humanism\nand its allegedly unfounded ethos of equality suggest a reading that would see\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 522  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n523\nMinkkinen \u2022  Ressent iment  as  Suf fer ing\nall conditional elements in the work of truth commissions\u2014the juridification\nof truth, the pseudo-legal procedure, the managerial ethos of \u201cgovernance,\u201d\netc.\u2014as a reflection of the same ressentiment that torments the unforgiving\nvictim. Through its symbolic reconstruction of the historical narrative of the\npast, a truth commission can merely participate in the victim\u2019s ressentiment.\nParticipation reinforces the victim\u2019s resentful sentiments because it can only\noffer imaginary surrogates. This hinders the victim\u2019s self-affirmation rather\nthan reinforces it.\nR E S S E N T I M E N T  A N D  M O R A L I T Y\nFor Scheler, then, just as for Nietzsche, the resentful victim of an atrocity\nwould be someone unable to act, someone incapable of externalizing the\nemotional scars of his injuries through either a gracious act of forgiveness or\na psychologically purging retaliation because of an innate weakness. The\npresumption seems to be that man has a natural tendency to defuse any con-\ntradictions or tensions that might endanger the tranquility of his world.29 The\nabsence of this tendency is first attributed to a factual weakness that is then\nreinterpreted as normative values. But both authors go beyond the mere\ndescription of how the victim creates and adopts these values and proceed to a\nvalidation of the morality of ressentiment itself. And in this validation, the vic-\ntim, unable to externalize his suffering, must ultimately bear the responsibility\nfor his own inadequacies.\nA strikingly different take on ressentiment is offered by Jean Am\u00e9ry.30 Born\nHans Mayer in Vienna in \uf731\uf739\uf731\uf732 to a Jewish-Christian family, Am\u00e9ry was ini-\ntially an aspiring albeit unsuccessful author. In \uf731\uf739\uf733\uf738, he fled the Nazis first to\nFrance and later to Belgium, where he was arrested for his involvement in the\nresistance movement in \uf731\uf739\uf734\uf733. Having spent two years in various concentra-\ntion camps, he returned to Belgium after the war to write articles for various\nGerman-language newspapers. In \uf731\uf739\uf736\uf736, he finally entered into the conscious-\nness of the German literary scene with the publication of Jenseits von Schuld\nund S\u00fchne.31 This short book, with its obvious allusion to Nietzsche (\u201cBeyond\nGuilt and Atonement\u201d), is a collection of five essays, each exploring the\nhighly personalized experience of a Holocaust survivor. \nOne of the book\u2019s essays, aptly titled \u201cRessentiments,\u201d is an introspective\nanalysis of the resentful sentiments that the victim of the Shoah persistently\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 523  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n524\nLaw & L i terature \u2022  Volume 19,  Number  3\nfeels against both his persecutors and their compatriots more generally.\nAm\u00e9ry recognizes that what eventually sets him apart from both his fellow\nvictims \u201cnow gushing over about reconciliation\u201d and his enemies \u201cconverted\nto tolerance\u201d is his inability and unwillingness to appease his ressentiment\ntowards the German people. This, however, obliges the resentful victim to\nclarify his feelings to those against whom they are directed. A key to under-\nstanding Am\u00e9ry\u2019s account of what he calls the \u201cessence of victim-existence\u201d\nis time:\nressentiment is not only an unnatural but also a logically contradictory condi-\ntion. It nails every one of us onto the cross of his ruined past. Absurdly it\ndemands that the irreversible be turned around, that the event be undone.\nRessentiment blocks the exit into the genuine human dimension, the future.32\nBy refusing to accept the \u201cnatural\u201d course of time, ressentiment becomes an\nanti-humanism. One does not resent only the crimes that were committed or\nthose who committed them. The apparent ease with which both the victim\u2019s\npersecutors and the \u201clofty ethical flights\u201d of mediating third parties manage to\nturn to an allegedly common future becomes a major catalyst in Am\u00e9ry\u2019s res-\nsentiment:\nIt is impossible for me to accept a parallelism that would have my path run\nbeside that of the fellows who flogged me with a horsewhip. I do not want to\nbecome the accomplice of my torturers, rather I demand that they negate them-\nselves and in the negation coordinate with me.33\nAm\u00e9ry clearly sees any formalized attempt to uncover the \u201ctruth\u201d of the\ncrimes committed as a moral insult. In order to make it possible for an\noffender to assume responsibility for his actions, a process such as a truth\ncommission will try to objectify history into a verifiable narrative of causes\nand effects which, Am\u00e9ry claims, contradicts the victim\u2019s inalienable right to\nresent. As W. G. Sebald notes in identifying a literary kinship between Am\u00e9ry\nand the uncompromising radicalism of Bataille and Cioran:\nAm\u00e9ry believes as little in the possibility of revenge as in the idea of atone-\nment, which he describes as dubious from the outset: at the most, he considers\nit of theological significance and therefore irrelevant to him.

Only I possess and possessed the moral truth of the blows that\nstill today roar in my skull, and I am therefore more entitled to judge, not only\nmore than the perpetrator but also more than society that only thinks of its con-\ntinued existence.35\nTherefore, any formalized process of reconciliation that is oriented\ntowards the future is immoral, and forgiving in such circumstances implies a\nshameful subjection to what Am\u00e9ry calls the \u201cnatural time\u201d of healing. Pre-\ncisely because such a conception of healing with time is \u201cnatural,\u201d Am\u00e9ry\ninsists that it is not only immoral but radically alien to morality. As a moral\nbeing, man has both the right and the privilege to contradict any natural\noccurrence, and this includes the healing that time allegedly brings about.\nHealing, then, is not a natural phenomenon into which a given process, a truth\ncommission or other, can escort the victim. It is a radical choice that Am\u00e9ry\nconsiders to be both contrary to what he understands as morality and evi-\ndence of the victim\u2019s subjugation to his persecutors.\nBut Am\u00e9ry does recognize two functional aspects in his ressentiment. On\nthe one hand, ressentiment represents the victim\u2019s subjective efforts to purge\nhimself, to turn back time in order to undo the suffering that he has endured.\nResenting is neither retaliating nor forgiving, but for the victim it has a cathar-\ntic potential. Am\u00e9ry duly admits that his claim is \u201cabsurd,\u201d but he insists that\nit is the victim\u2019s right because morality is by necessity dissociated from the dic-\ntates of \u201cnatural time.\u201d But ressentiment also has a more objective and histori-\ncal task, no less absurd or moral than the victim\u2019s demand that the irreversible\nbe reversed: ressentiment invokes the German revolution that never took\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 525  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n526\nLaw & L i terature \u2022  Volume 19,  Number  3\nplace. Face to face with such moral and yet absurd demands, Am\u00e9ry can see\nbut one solution:\n . . . ressentiment is kept alive in one camp and, aroused by it, self-mistrust in the\nother. Motivated only by the spurs of our ressentiments\u2014and not in the least by\na conciliatoriness [Vers\u00f6hnlichkeit] that is subjectively almost always dubious\nand objectively hostile to history\u2014the German people would remain sensitive\nto the fact that they cannot allow a part of their national history to be neutralized\nby time but must integrate it . . . it would no longer repress or hush up the\ntwelve years that for us others really were a thousand but claim them as the\nworld and negation of self that it realized, as its negative possession.36\nThere is, however, no objective truth to claim, no common history to recog-\nnize, but only the subjective moral truth of a victim who will persistently\nrefuse to forgive. And with every attempt at a practical social arrangement for\nreconciliation contradicting the moral right of the victim to resent, the possi-\nbilities of transitional justice would seem to be very limited.\nR E S S E N T I M E N T  A N D  S U F F E R I N G\nThe humanistically inclined legal theorist will duly recognize the victim\u2019s\nright not to forgive and to continue resenting his offender. But committed to\nthe ideals of transitional justice, the recognition of such a right can only take\nplace within an already existing process of reconciliation, i.e., through the\nconditional necessities of forgiveness, irrespective of whether we are talking\nabout a factually existing procedure or merely an intellectual framework.\nThis double gesture of recognizing the victim\u2019s right to resent and concur-\nrently sustaining a process that could never have respected such a contradict-\ning right in the first place can only be performed from a position that identifies\nthe theorist with the victim, by partaking in his suffering through an economy\nof compassion and extending the duration of the process in the victim\u2019s name.\nSuch a compassionate position is by necessity an imposition, an intrusion by a\nthird party that, if we are to believe Derrida, necessarily corrupts the struc-\ntural preconditions of forgiveness into \u201csocial therapy.\u201d\nJank\u00e9l\u00e9vitch calls such humanistic processes \u201cintellection,\u201d where the primary\naim is to attain forgiveness by understanding the atrocities committed:\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 526  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n527\nMinkkinen \u2022  Ressent iment  as  Suf fer ing\nby instituting an abstract fraternity amongst men, intellection recognizes and\nrespects the relative truth of every being and the equal advancement of all\nbeings. But this type of forgiveness has no second person: it deals with the anon-\nymous universality of \u201cthird\u201d persons, but it does not address you. Unlike true\nforgiveness, it is not engaged in the immediate relationship with its face-to-face\ncounterpart, but is impartial. . . .37\nIf forgiveness is to play any part in a theory of transitional justice, the theorist\nmust dissociate himself from the \u201cintellection\u201d of committed crimes and adopt\na more integral position. But if theory is never victimized and is, therefore,\nitself never in a position to forgive anything, how can such an integral position\nbe adopted? How can theory engage with the \u201cface-to-face counterpart\u201d of\nthe atrocity it is trying to address? \nPerhaps we should view the resentful victim in symptomatic rather than\npathological terms. In that case, ressentiment and the victim\u2019s outspoken elab-\norations of his unwillingness to forgive can be best understood as a reliving of\nhis original victimization. As such, ressentiment is not unlike Freud\u2019s account\nof the repetition compulsion in traumatic neuroses where the neurotic patient\ncontinuously re-enacts the painful experience in his attempts to bring the\ntrauma under the mastery of the pleasure principle:\nthe compulsion to repeat also recalls from the past experiences that include no\npossibility of pleasure, which could not have provided satisfaction to instinctual\nimpulses even if they had since been repressed. . . . Neurotics now repeat in the\ntransference all these unwanted situations and painful emotions and revive\nthem with great skill.38\nThrough his ressentiment, the victim perpetuates his suffering in a way that\nclearly contradicts the pleasure principle. He returns to the trauma of the inju-\nries he has suffered without being able to forget or, indeed, without even\nwanting to do so. Ressentiment is, then, an expression of the death instinct and,\nconsequently, a symptom of the victim\u2019s original trauma. In other words, the\nvictim\u2019s unwillingness to forgive is the symptom of his suffering rather than\nthe expression of any innate weakness. When theory confronts a resentful\nvictim, it is addressing suffering, and in the theory of transitional justice, the\npossibility of forgiveness becomes dependent on how theory confronts the\nsuffering of the victim.\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 527  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n528\nLaw & L i terature \u2022  Volume 19,  Number  3\nFollowing Emmanuel Levinas, ressentiment as suffering can be said to be\nintrinsically \u201cuseless.\u201d It includes within itself an apparent contradiction. On\nthe one hand, Levinas seems to be saying, suffering is quantifiable data in the\nconsciousness of the victim, but on the other hand, suffering is also a rejection\nor a refusal to order this data into a meaningful whole. The sensation of the\ncontradiction itself accounts for the misery of suffering, its woe. And in the\ncase of ressentiment, the refusal is audible in the victim\u2019s seemingly \u201cirratio-\nnal\u201d resentment.39\nThe suffering that refuses to take on meaning overwhelms the victim more\nviolently and cruelly than any violation of his personal integrity and in Levi-\nnas\u2019s terms also renders it \u201cuseless\u201d: because it refuses to make sense, suffer-\ning is essentially \u201cfor nothing.\u201d But for Levinas, this uselessness also marks\nthe possibility of an ethics. The refusal to take on meaning provides an open-\ning through which \u201ca moan, a cry, a groan, or a sigh passes, the original appeal\nfor aid, for healing help, for help from the other me whose alterity, whose\nexteriority promises salvation.\u201d40 And it is only by responding to this original\nappeal that intrinsically useless suffering can become just within the radical\nhumanism that Levinas calls the interhuman: the other\u2019s suffering will finally\nmake sense as my suffering for the suffering of the other.41\nSo how can the resentful victim\u2019s suffering become my suffering, the theo-\nrist\u2019s suffering?\nI am the offender; I am the object of the victim\u2019s ressentiment regardless of\nwhether I am the actual persecutor or have contributed to his suffering\nthrough my clumsy attempts at unsolicited understanding and alleviation.\nConfronted by an impenetrable suffering and an irreconcilable ressentiment,\ntheory finds itself in a situation where it can neither ask for forgiveness\u2014I am\nnot requested to do so or permitted to absolve myself unilaterally\u2014nor the-\nmatize forgiveness into effectual social practices that would by necessity\nundermine its offences. As offender, the only thing left to do is for theory to\naccept the irreconcilable and the impasse that follows.\nThere are two ways to read this impasse. A cynical reading will retract and\nfind solace in the liberalist tradition of law that, whatever its other shortcom-\nings may be, can at least formalize the encounter between victim and factual\noffender into workable solutions. Where no unconditional forgiveness is\navailable, law will settle for the conditional, for clemency and amnesty. This is\nwhy truth commissions are procedurally and administratively so easily jurid-\nified. And even if they operate at the fringes of law, there is nothing radically\nLAL1903_06.fm  Page 528  Wednesday, September 12, 2007  3:18 PM\nThis content downloaded from 143.210.90.156 on Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:27:37 AM\nAll use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions\n529\nMinkkinen \u2022  Ressent iment  as  Suf fer ing\nnew about the way they function. It is still a more or less formalized encounter\nbetween an offender and a victim before a seemingly neutral third party that\nendorses the objectified outcome through its authority.\nBut I believe that there is a more radical way of understanding the impasse.\nThe resentful victim is my absolutely other. Face to face with an unforgiving\nother, I take responsibility for a suffering that is both impenetrable and incom-\nprehensible. I acknowledge the necessity to avoid any gesture of comprehen-\nsion or compassion that would reduce the victim into my likeness within a\nshared and totalizing humanity. As a theorist, I can address the possibility of\nunconditional forgiveness only by taking on the responsibility of the persecutor.\nMy relation to my resentful victim is what Blanchot calls a relation of the\nthird kind. Founded neither on a crude identification that would reduce every-\nthing to sameness nor on a desire that aspires to sublate the relation between\nsubject and object into oneness, the Other remains a complete \u201chorizonless\u201d\nstranger who introduces the interruption that makes ethics possible:\nin and through this other relation, the other is for me the very presence of the\nother in his distant infinity, man as absolutely other and radically strange, he\nwho neither yields to the Same nor is exalted to the unity of the Unique.42\nTheory addresses unconditional forgiveness by negating itself or, as Am\u00e9ry\nsuggests, by claiming the atrocities committed as its own negative possession.\nBy unconditionally accepting the victim\u2019s right to resent and by recognizing\nhis suffering as its own doing, theory can begin to work out the ethical pre-\nconditions of a transitional justice that would enable forgiveness to take place.\nThe encounter between theory and its resentful victim is the aporia of for-\ngiveness that Derrida identifies, and it is within this aporia that theory,\nresented and unforgiven, assumes its responsibility.\n* My thanks to V\u00e9ronique Voruz, Colin Perrin, and Marty Slaughter for their comments.\n  \uf731.
