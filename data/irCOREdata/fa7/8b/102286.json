The SRH coefficient is nearly constant\n(A\u20194.03108 s21), while the Auger coefficient has an upper limit of C54.0310227 to 2.2310227 cm6\/s in the\ntemperature range 40\u2013230 K. This represents an order of magnitude Auger suppression compared to type-I\nIII-V semiconductors with the same energy gap.I. INTRODUCTION\nAs is well known, the ability to control the Auger recom-\nbination rate in narrow-gap semiconductor systems, either by\ndirect device design1\u20133 ~involving carrier extraction and ex-\nclusion! or by band structure engineering,4\u20138 is critical to a\nnumber of important applications for which the Auger pro-\ncess fundamentally limits the performance. Low-threshold\nnonlinear devices controlled by cw lasers and high-\nsensitivity mid-infrared detectors and emitters need long ex-\ncess carrier lifetimes, whereas applications such as laser\nmode locking, ultrafast radiation detectors, and optical\nswitches require recovery times as short as possible. Despite\nthe fact that intersubband quantum well detectors and quan-\ntum cascade ~QC! lasers have been operated very success-\nfully at long wavelengths ~superlattice QC lasers out to 17\nmm have been reported9!, interband narrow-gap detectors\nand lasers are generally the most attractive option in the 5\nmm region. For example, pulsed InSb\/In12xAlxSb hetero-\nstructure diodes at 5.1 mm3 and optically pumped type-II\nquantum well lasers6 have operated well above 77 K, and\nrecently so-called type-II W structures have lased in cw\nmode in the 6 mm region at 210 K.10\nType-~II! quantum well ~QW! lasers employing InAs\/\nGaInSb active regions have been known for a number of\nyears to show great promise for the mid-infrared ~MIR! spec-\ntral region,11 in part because the so-called CHHS Auger tran-\nsitions @i.e., where the conduction-to-heavy-hole ~CH! re-\ncombination is accompanied by a heavy-to-split-off-hole\ntransition# are eliminated by effectively removing the reso-\nnance between the energy gap Eg and spin-orbit splitting D0 .\nIn particular, the type-II W multiple quantum well ~named\nfor the shape of the four-constituent conduction band profile\nof the InAs\/Ga12xInxSb\/InAs\/AlSb active region! preserves\nthe large optical matrix elements of the InAs\/Ga12xInxSb\nsuperlattice while yielding the preferred two-dimensional\n~2D! dispersion relations for both electrons and holes.12 Op-\ntically pumped W-shaped lasers have recently operated in cwPRB 620163-1829\/2000\/62~15!\/10297~4!\/$15.00mode out to wavelengths as long as 7.1 mm, and are pre-\ndicted by computer simulations to be attractive for operation\nat still longer wavelengths beyond 25 mm.13\nWe earlier reported the utilization of rf linac-pumped\nfree-electron lasers ~FEL\u2019s! to study Auger recombination,\nand particularly its deliberate suppression, in arsenic-rich\nInAs\/InAs12xSbx type-II strained-layer superlattices at room\ntemperature,14 by comparison with similar measurements15,16\non epilayers of bulk Hg12xCdxTe with the same cutoff wave-\nlength near 10 mm. Lifetimes for type-II W lasers were de-\nrived previously by correlating the experimental threshold\nintensities for optically pumped lasing with calculated\nthreshold carrier concentrations.17,18 However, those experi-\nments did not yield an independent determination of the\nShockley-Read-Hall ~SRH! and Auger contributions, since at\neach temperature T the lifetime could be obtained for only\none special carrier density corresponding to the lasing\nthreshold at that T. In the present study, we have used the\nmore direct pump-probe measurement technique to indepen-\ndently determine the SRH contribution and an upper limit on\nthe Auger contribution for the temperature range from 40 to\n230 K.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nTwo W-structure laser samples were grown by molecular-\nbeam epitaxy on p-GaSb substrates at NRL, using proce-\ndures described elsewhere.19 The active regions contained\n70 four-constituent periods consisting of InAs(25 \u00c5)\/\nGa0.7In0.3Sb(24 \u00c5)\/InAs(25 \u00c5)\/AlSb(42 \u00c5) for sample\nN5 and InAs(28 \u00c5)\/Ga0.64In0.36Sb(22 \u00c5)\/InAs(28 \u00c5)\/\nAlSb(42 \u00c5) for sample N8, which were surrounded by\nAlSb bottom and top optical cladding layers and GaSb buffer\nand cap layers. Lasing properties of the two structures were\nreported previously.18 The present wavelength-degenerate\npump-probe transmission experiments were performed with\nthe Dutch FEL in Utrecht ~FELIX!, which operates with\npulse trains ~\u2018\u2018macropulses\u2019\u2019! of typical length 4 ms and at a\nrepetition rate of 5 Hz. The macropulse consists of a train of\n\u2018\u2018micropulses,\u2019\u2019 each of adjustable width in the range 2\u20131010 297 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\n10 298 PRB 62P. C. FINDLAY et al.ps and separated by 40 ns. It was shown previously14,16 that,\nfor the excitation conditions used throughout this study, car-\nrier temperatures approach the lattice temperature to within\n2% in less than 3 ps, which results in a temperature increase\nin the sample of only ;0.02 K per pulse. Hence, we have\nneglected heating effects and, for recombination processes\noccurring in less than about 20 ns ~see below!, have inter-\npreted the data in terms of independent single pulses.\nThe macropulse fluctuations of FELIX, which depend\nstrongly on the required performance of the machine, are\ntypically of the order of a few percent. In order to obtain a\ngood signal-to-noise ratio in the MIR regime, we utilized a\npump-probe method that compensates for these macropulse\nfluctuations. The experimental arrangement consisted of a\nthree-beam pump-probe-reference setup that has been de-\nscribed in detail elsewhere.16 The result was a signal\/noise\nratio better than 0.1%, even when the fluctuations from mac-\nropulse to macropulse were several percent. The three beams\nwere focused on the sample using an f 525 cm parabolic\nmirror, which resulted in a spot size of 100 mm. The effec-\ntive pump and probe energy fluences per micropulse were\nestimated to be 350 and 10 mJ\/cm2, respectively, including\nlosses due to beam splitters and optics. The relative transmit-\ntance of the probe was measured directly as a function of\noptical delay t between the pump and probe pulses. The\nsample was mounted in a flow cryostat ~4\u2013300 K!.\nAs the pump radiation is absorbed, band filling causes a\nstrong dynamic blueshift in the IR absorption edge ~the dy-\nnamic Moss-Burstein shift! and leads to pronounced bleach-\ning near the excitation frequency.16,20 Recovery times in the\nrange 20\u20131200 ps were found and shown to be strongly de-\npendent on both the sample temperature and the excited car-\nrier density. Typical pump-probe transmission data for W\nlaser sample N5 are shown in Fig. 1, taken at 230 K with a\npump wavelength of 4.5 mm. We find that at all temperatures\nstimulated radiative emission represents the most efficient\nrecombination mechanism for probe delays of up to 100 ps,\nwhile nonradiative processes dominate at times longer than\n100 ps. The pump-probe technique then allows a direct mea-\nsurement of the excited carrier density as a function of time\nFIG. 1. Three-beam measurement of probe differential transmis-\nsion change versus delay time for sample N5 at T5230 K, pump\nwavelength 4.5 mm.as the excited carriers recombine. By contrast with our ear-\nlier work on bulk materials,16 we find that even at room\ntemperature both the SRH and Auger processes make a sig-\nnificant contribution to the nonradiative recombination at\nlow excitation levels. Analysis of the recovery of the probe\nabsorption leads to a determination of the recombination co-\nefficients as described below.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nIn order to interpret the raw data of probe transmission\nversus probe delay time we need to convert the measured\ntransmission into values of excited carrier concentration\nNe(t).14\u201316 The rate of decay of Ne(t) with pump-probe de-\nlay can then be extracted directly, and the SRH and Auger\nrecombination coefficients obtained by fitting Ne(t) with a\nsimple rate equation. The pump pulse drives apart the elec-\ntron and hole quasi-Fermi energies and bleaches the trans-\nmission. While the bleaching is not necessarily complete, a\nshorter pump wavelength maximizes the possible separation\nof the quasi-Fermi energies. For any given wavelength, each\ntransmission value corresponds to a unique photoexcited\nelectron and hole concentration, Ne5Nh . The analysis uses\na knowledge of the band structure18 and small-signal absorp-\ntion cross section to calculate the density of states and hence\nthe transmission as a function of carrier concentration. Since\nthe measured lifetimes are substantially longer than the pulse\nduration ~5 ps!, the generation rate is zero during the probe\npulse delay time. The recombination rate, which is some\nfunction of Ne(t), can then be measured unambiguously.\nThe pulse duration may similarly be neglected @i.e., the\nprobe pulse shape function I(t) is effectively a d function#\nwhen we calculate the sample transmission\nT~\\v ,t !}exp@2a~\\v ,t !d# , ~1!\nwhere \\v is the photon energy and d is the active thickness.\nWe assume that the absorption coefficient a, while time and\nwavelength dependent, is spatially constant through the\nprobed region of the sample. This is a good approximation\nbecause the initial concentration would be spatially uniform\nfor complete bleaching. Note that, while the probe reflectiv-\nity is complicated by the varying refractive indices of the\ncladding, active, and substrate layers of the laser structure,\nthis does not significantly influence the results of our signal\nprocessing, which takes the ratio of the measured difference\nin the probe and reference transmission to the reference\ntransmission. The reflectivities cancel ~apart from a small\noptically induced contribution!, and we are left with an ex-\npression that relies solely on the change in the absorption\ncoefficient, Da, induced by the pump.\nThe data analysis procedure incorporates our knowledge\nof the band structure for the W-structure quantum wells,18\nwhich governs the ~final and initial! electron and hole ener-\ngies ~Ee and Eh! for the optical transitions at a given photon\nenergy, and also the density of states functions ~ge and gh ,\nboth of which may include contributions from multiple sub-\nbands!. The band structure is calculated using an eight-band\nk\u0095p calculation resulting in the required in-plane two-\ndimensional dispersion relation. Inspection of the calculated\nband structure determines that the energy range available in\nthe present experiment results in only transitions involving\nPRB 62 10 299SUPPRESSION OF AUGER RECOMBINATION IN LONG- . . .the electron and heavy-hole subbands. The 2D density of\nstates function we take to be ge5me\/2p\\2.\nFor a range of electron Fermi energies, one then computes\nthe corresponding hole Fermi energies and electron and hole\nexcited carrier concentrations from the relation\nNe5E\nEc\n\u2018\nf e~E !ge~E !dE5E\n2\u2018\nEv\nh\nf h~E !gh~E !dE , ~2!\nwhere f e and f h are the Fermi occupation probability func-\ntions for electrons and holes, respectively, and Ec and Ev are\nthe conduction and valence band edge energies. This gives\ntwo-dimensional excited carrier concentrations which, if we\nare to compare with bulk materials, require a conversion to\nthree dimensions. To find the corresponding three-\ndimensional excited carrier concentrations N3D , we use the\nexpression N3D5N2D \/L , where N2D is the sheet density per\nfour-constituent period of the W structure and L is the period\nthickness.10 At the same time, each assumed value of elec-\ntron Fermi energy determines a unique value of a ~and hence\nT! from the relation\na5s@12 f e~Ee!2 f h~Eh!#Jcv~\\v!, ~3!\nwhere \\v5Ee2Eh , Jcv(\\v) is the joint density of states,\nand the absorption cross section s is normally determined by\nfitting the theoretical transmission corresponding to the equi-\nlibrium Fermi energy to the small-signal absorption spectrum\ntaken with a Fourier-transform spectrometer. However, this\nhas not been possible for the present W-structure lasers be-\ncause the active layer is too thin to make a good absolute\ndetermination of a from the transmission measurements. We\ntherefore derived s from a theoretical analysis of the lasing\ncharacteristics.18 We again use the relation s3D5s2D \/L .\nWe can now calculate the value of the excited carrier\nconcentration Ne(t) corresponding to each value of transmis-\nsion T(t). As described previously, we have also included\nthe effect of small refractive index changes arising from a\nshift in the plasma frequency.15 Figure 2 shows a typical plot\nof Ne versus tdelay corresponding to the raw transmission data\nin Fig. 1 ~sample N6!. For the region below the threshold\nconcentration for stimulated emission, the dynamics may be\napproximated by the simple rate equation\n1\nNe\ndNe~ t !\ndt 5A1BNe~ t !1CNe\n2~ t !, ~4!\nwhere A, B, and C are the SRH, radiative, and Auger recom-\nbination coefficients, respectively, for a nondegenerate Ne\ndistribution. For these laser samples amplified spontaneous\nemission ~ASE! occurs at quite low values of Ne , when\nE f\nc1E f\nv.0. ~5!\nIn an inverted sample, spontaneously emitted photons are\namplified by the presence of ASE. This results in an expo-\nnential increase in the number of photons and a decrease of\nthe excited carrier density, which produces the sharp rise in\nthe recombination rate observed in Fig. 2 at carrier densities\nabove 3.731017 cm23. We note that the value of Ne(t) at\nwhich we see the onset of rapid decay almost exactly coin-\ncides with the concentration determined for lasing threshold\nin these samples (Ne5531017 cm23).17,18 We can do aback-of-the-envelope calculation to justify this interpretation\nas follows. The increase in recombination rate per carrier due\nto ASE is\n1\nNs\ndNs\ndt 5\nbP\nNs\n, ~6!\nwhere Ns is the spontaneous carrier density, b is the gain,\nand P is the photon density. The last is given by21\nP5\nP0\nb\n@exp~bL !21# , ~7!\nwhere P0 is the spontaneously emitted photon density cap-\ntured by the waveguide and L is the length of the pumped\nsection. Based on the excited carrier density we estimate that\nbL ranges up to at least 5. The total spontaneously emitted\nphoton density per unit time ~i.e., Ns \/ts , where ts is the\nspontaneous emission time\u2014a few nanoseconds at these\nconcentrations12! is ;1025 cm23 s21. Assuming that a rea-\nsonable fraction of this actually stays in the waveguide, we\nget an upper bound of about 1010 s21 for the increase in\nrecombination rate per carrier due to ASE. The actual in-\ncrease we observe is ;53109 s21, which we believe is rea-\nsonable to attribute to ASE.\nFrom previous work14\u201316 we estimate the radiative recom-\nbination to be negligible in this concentration range. Unfor-\ntunately, given the limited range of data in Fig. 2 available\nfor fitting, we cannot distinguish between a simple exponen-\ntial fit and the full fit of Eq. ~4!. Thus, we make a simple\nexponential fit dNe \/dt5ANe to the data to obtain the SRH\ncoefficient A543108 s21. We then obtain an upper limit for\nC as follows. The full equation to be fitted to the low-\nconcentration portion of the curve is dNe \/dt5ANe1CNe\n3\n.\nThis equation can be integrated analytically to obtain\nNe5@k exp~2At !2C\/A#21\/2, ~8!\nFIG. 2.

The solid curve is a simple exponential fit to\nthe equation dNe \/dt5ANe .\n10 300 PRB 62P. C. FINDLAY et al.where k is a constant of the integration. Taking Eq. ~8! and\nsuccessively reducing the value of A ~to unphysically small\nvalues in order to obtain an upper bound on C!, it is found\nthat C tends toward an asymptotic value of 4.0\n310227 cm6 s21. This implies that the actual value of C is\nsignificantly suppressed compared to type-I III-V semicon-\nductors with the same cutoff wavelength of 6.1 mm for\nsample N5 and 7.3 mm for sample N8.17,18 It has been\npointed out that suppression via the valence band engineer-\ning is not expected to be strong in these samples,17 particu-\nlarly at room temperature where thermal and inhomogeneity\nbroadening are important. However, there is clearly signifi-\ncant Auger suppression, much of which arises from suppres-\nsion of the so-called CCCH process @i.e., where the CH re-\ncombination is accompanied by an electron transition to\nhigher-energy conduction-band state ~CC!#, resulting from\nthe type-II band alignment\u2014i.e., the resultant \u2018\u2018narrow\u2019\u2019 gap\nis created from two comparatively large-gap component lay-\ners.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nSummarizing, we have utilized a picosecond free-electron\nlaser to measure directly the SRH recombination rates fortwo long-wavelength W-structure laser samples with\nInAs\/Ga12xInxSb\/InAs\/AlSb active regions in the tempera-\nture range 40\u2013230 K. We have determined an upper bound\non the Auger coefficient to be 4.0310227 cm6 s21 in the tem-\nperature range 40\u2013230 K. This represents a suppression of\nthe Auger coefficient by about an order of magnitude com-\npared to type-I semiconductor systems with the same energy\ngap.17 The SRH coefficient is A54.03108 s21. These results\nprovide clear confirmation that Auger recombination is\nstrongly suppressed in long-wavelength (l.5 mm) type-II-\nquantum wells. This consequence of band structure engineer-\ning will become even more important when laser operation is\nattempted at wavelengths as long as 25 mm.13\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge EPSRC for support of this work\n~J.P.
