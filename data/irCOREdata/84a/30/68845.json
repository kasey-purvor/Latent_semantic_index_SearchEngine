Both the accumula-\ntion of specific toxic ions (e.g. Na+) and changes in leaf\nhormone relations are involved in the regulation of this\nprocess. Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv\nMoneymaker) were cultivated for 3 weeks under high\nsalinity (100 mM NaCl) and leaf senescence-related\nparameters were studied during leaf development in\nrelation to Na+ and K+ contents and changes in\nabscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins, the ethylene precursor\n1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and the\nauxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Na+ accumulated to\na similar extent in both leaves 4 and 5 (numbering from\nthe base of the plant) and more quickly during the third\nweek, while concurrently K+ contents sharply de-\ncreased. However, photosystem II efficiency, mea-\nsured as the Fv\/Fm ratio, decreased from the second\nweek of salinization in leaf 4 but only at the end of the\nthird week in the younger leaf 5. In the prematurely\nsenescent leaf 4, ABA content increased linearly while\nIAA strongly decreased with salinization time. Al-\nthough zeatin (Z) levels were scarcely affected by\nsalinity, zeatin-riboside (ZR) and the total cytokinin\ncontent (Z+ZR) progressively decreased by 50% from\nthe imposition of the stress. ACC was the only\nhormonal compound that increased in leaf tissue\ncoincident with the onset of oxidative damage and the\ndecline in chlorophyll fluorescence, and prior to\nmassive Na+ accumulation. Indeed, (Z+ZR) and ACC\ncontents and their ratio (Z+ZR\/ACC) were the hormonal\nparameters best correlated with the onset and pro-\ngression of leaf senescence. The influence of different\nhormonal changes on salt-induced leaf senescence is\ndiscussed.\nKey words: Abscisic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic\nacid, indole-3-acetic acid, plant hormones, salt stress,\nsenescence, sodium chloride, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum\nL.), zeatin, zeatin-riboside.\nIntroduction\nTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is the world\u2019s most\nimportant vegetable crop in economic terms (Nuez et al.,\n2004), and is considered moderately salt tolerant, with\n* These authors contributed equally to this work.\ny To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Since\navailable soil and water resources are becoming increas-\ningly salinized, the negative impact on crop productivity\nis continuously increasing. Hence, efforts have been made\nduring the last 50 years to improve the salt tolerance of\ntomato, but with little success due in part to insufficient\nknowledge about the mechanisms involved in limiting\nyield (Cuartero et al., 2005). Since cellular events tri-\nggered by salinity, such as salt compartmentation, osmotic\nadjustment, changes in metabolic fluxes, and cell wall\nhardening, are connected to whole plant responses, such\nas growth reduction, changes in biomass allocation and\nphenology, leaf senescence, and finally plant death\n(Volkmar et al., 1998), the candidate genes to increase\nsalt tolerance are those involved in regulating such\nprocesses (Munns, 2005). Therefore, salt tolerance could\nbe improved by avoiding or delaying senescence, allow-\ning plant resource acquisition for a longer period, to\ngenerate new growth and maintain defence mechanisms\nsuch as ionic regulation to avoid the massive entry of\ntoxic ions to the plant\nPlant senescence is an internally programmed degrada-\ntion leading to cell death. Since chloroplasts appear to be\nthe initial target of senescence, and chlorophyll breakdown\nis so prominent, chlorophyll loss and the associated\nyellowing of the leaves are commonly used as indicators\nof plant senescence (Noode\u00b4n et al., 1997). The onset and\nprogression of leaf senescence are regulated by both\nenvironmental and endogenous factors and their interac-\ntions. Environmental cues include stress factors that\nadversely affect plant development and productivity, such\nas drought, waterlogging, high or low solar radiation,\nextreme temperatures, ozone and other air pollutants,\nexcessive soil salinity, and inadequate mineral nutrition in\nthe soil (Munne\u00b4-Bosch and Alegre, 2004). Endogenous\nfactors include age, reproductive development, and level of\nplant hormones. These environmental cues may accelerate\nleaf senescence by affecting those endogenous factors\n(Munne\u00b4-Bosch and Alegre, 2004).\nSalinity reduces plant productivity first by reducing\nplant growth during the phase of osmotic stress and\nsubsequently by inducing leaf senescence during the\nphase of toxicity when excessive salt is accumulated in\ntranspiring leaves (Munns, 2002a). Indeed, in spite of the\npositive effect of Na+ compartmentation into vacuoles to\nmaintain turgor (Flowers, 2004), premature senescence\ncaused by salinity seems to occur more quickly in\nglycophytic plants having a higher Na+ uptake (Fortmeier\nand Schubert, 1995; Munns, 2002a, b). However, as\npreviously stated, growth inhibition and metabolic\nchanges occurring during the osmotic phase of salinity\nare similar to those triggered by drought, which can also\nlead to premature senescence (Munns, 2002a, b). In turn,\nsenescence induced by the osmotic component of salinity\nprobably follows the same physiological events as\ndrought-induced senescence (Pic et al., 2002). The initial\nreduction in shoot growth followed by accelerated\nsenescence is probably related to hormonal signals\ngenerated in response to the stress. Much evidence\nsuggests that cytokinins (CKs) are the major leaf\nsenescence-inhibiting hormones, since senescence is de-\nlayed after the exogenous application of CKs (Van Staden\net al., 1988) or the overproduction of CKs in transgenic\nplants transformed with the CK biosynthetic genes,\nisopentenyl transferase (IPT) (Gan and Amasino, 1995;\nCowan et al., 2005; Rivero et al., 2007) and zeatin\nO-glucosyltransferase (ZOG1) (Havlova et al., 2008), and\nsenescence is correlated with a decline in endogenous CK\nlevels (Van Staden et al., 1988; Singh et al., 1992; Gan\nand Amasino, 1995). Leaf senescence can only be\ninitiated when leaf CK levels fall below a threshold\n(Noode\u00b4n et al., 1997). Maintaining CK levels above this\nthreshold inhibits transcriptional regulation of senescence-\nrelated genes and prevents the onset of senescence in the\nentire plant (Gan and Amasino, 1995).\nA direct role in the regulation of drought-induced leaf\nsenescence has also been demonstrated for abscisic acid\n(ABA), CKs, and ethylene. Although the role of ABA in\nphloem sugar transport remains controversial (Estruch\net al., 1989; Lacombe et al., 2000), several studies\nrevealed that enhanced ABA contents increased carbon\nremobilization from senescing leaves to grains in drought-\nstressed cereals (Yang et al., 2002). In contrast, CK levels\nwere positively correlated with leaf photosynthetic rate,\nand water and chlorophyll contents in tobacco (Rivero\net al., 2007), thus presumably preventing leaf senescence\nunder stress (Munne\u00b4-Bosch and Alegre, 2004). The\ninvolvement of ethylene in enhancing leaf senescence has\nbeen demonstrated by decreasing expression of genes\ninvolved in ethylene biosynthesis [1-aminocyclopropane-\n1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase or ACC oxidase],\nwhich delayed senescence under drought conditions in\nmaize (Young et al., 2004), under salinity in tobacco (Wi\nand Park, 2002), and in the absence of stress in tomato\n(John et al., 1995). Although gibberellins and auxins have\nbeen suggested as putative regulators of leaf senescence\n(Zacarias and Reid, 1990; He et al., 2002), further studies\nare necessary to provide direct evidence of a role for these\ncompounds in the regulation of drought- and salt-induced\nleaf senescence. The auxin IAA is a putative senescence-\nretarding agent that decreases the expression of the SAG12\nsenescence promoter (Noh and Amasino, 1999), probably\nthrough interactions with other hormones, such as ethyl-\nene, and metabolic fluxes (Schippers et al., 2007). Studies\nat the molecular level have demonstrated that salicylates,\njasmonates, and ethylene regulate expression of genes\ncoding for transcription factors, which in turn regulate\nSAG expression, when plants are exposed to salt, osmotic,\nand cold stresses (Chen et al., 2002; He et al., 2002).\n3040 Ghanem et al.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAlthough some studies have addressed how phytohor-\nmones were affected by salinity (reviewed by Naqvi,\n1994; Munns, 2002a), there has been little attention paid\nto the role of changes in endogenous hormonal balance in\nthe onset and progression of salt stress-induced leaf\nsenescence in an important horticultural crop such as\ntomato. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine\nthe dynamic changes of selected endogenous hormones\n[CKs, ABA, ACC, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)] in\nrelation to the salt-induced senescence of tomato leaves\n(S. lycopersicum L.). Such information is a necessary\npreliminary to modifying hormone contents in vivo with\nthe aim of decreasing salt-induced senescence.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and culture conditions\nSeeds of tomato (S. lycopersicum L.) cv. Moneymaker were sown\nand seedlings allowed to grow in a germination chamber in trays\nfilled with a perlite\u2013vermiculite mix (1:3 v\/v) moistened regularly\nwith a half-strength modified Hoagland nutrient solution. Fourteen\ndays after sowing, seedlings were transferred into a growth chamber\nand fixed on polyvinyl chloride plates floating on aerated half-\nstrength modified Hoagland nutrient solution. The nutrient solution\ncontained the following chemicals (in mM): 5 KNO3, 1 NH4H2PO4,\n0.5 MgSO4, 5.5 Ca(NO3)2 and (in lM) 25 KCl, 10 H3BO3,\n1 MnSO4, 1 ZnSO4, 0.25 CuSO4, 10 Na2MoO4, and 1.87 g l\n\u00011 Fe-\nEDDHA. Solutions were refilled every 2 d and renewed every\nweek.\nPlants were grown in a growth chamber under a 16 h daylight\nperiod. The air temperature ranged from 25 \u0001C to 28 \u0001C during the\nday and from 17 \u0001C to 18 \u0001C during the night. Relative humidity\nwas maintained at 70 6 5% during the night and at 50 6 5% during\nthe day. Light intensity at the top of the canopy was ;245 lmol\nm\u00012 s\u00011 [photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)]. After 4 d of\nacclimatization in control conditions (18 d after sowing), the\nseedlings were exposed to 0 (control) or 100 mM NaCl added to\nthe nutrient solution for 22 d. Three replications with eight plants\nper replication and salt treatment were used in this study for the\nmeasurement of different parameters. Two specific leaves per plant\nwere chosen when salinity was imposed to monitor senescence and\nfor subsequent biochemical determinations: a young expanding leaf\n(;100 cm2), identified as leaf number 4 (from the bottom), and leaf\nnumber 5. Leaf material from six plants was harvested for different\nanalyses at 1, 9, 15, and 22 d of salt treatment.\nChlorophyll fluorescence\nModulated chlorophyll fluorescence was measured in tagged and\ndark-adapted (30 min) leaves in 6\u201310 plants per treatment, using\na chlorophyll fluorometer OS-30 (OptiSciences, Herts, UK) with an\nexcitation source intensity of 3000 lmol m\u00012 s\u00011. The minimal\nfluorescence intensity (F0) in a dark-adapted state was measured in\nthe presence of a background far-red light to favour rapid oxidation\nof intersystem electron carriers. The maximal fluorescence in-\ntensities in the dark-adapted state (Fm) and after adaptation to white\nactinic light (Fm#) were measured by 0.8 s saturating pulses\n(3000 lmol m\u00012 s\u00011). After the Fm# measurement, the actinic light\n(400 mol m\u00012 s\u00011) was switched off, and the far-red light was\napplied for 3 s in order to measure the minimal fluorescence\nintensity in the light-adapted state (F0#). The maximum quantum\nyield of open photosystem II (PSII) (Fv\/Fm) and the non-\nphotochemical quenching (NPQ) were calculated as (Fm\u2013F0)\/Fm\nand (Fm\u2013Fm#)\/Fm#, respectively (Maxwell and Johnson, 2000).\nOxidative damage\nThe level of lipid peroxidation was measured as 2-thiobarbituric\nacid-reactive substances (TBARs), mainly malondialdehyde\n(MDA), following the modified method of Heath and Parker\n(1968). Frozen leaf samples (0.25 g) were homogenized in a pre-\nchilled mortar with 5 ml of ice-cold 5% (w\/v) trichloroacetic acid\n(TCA) and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4 \u0001C. The assay\nmixture containing a 2 ml aliquot of supernatant and 2 ml of 0.67%\n(w\/v) thiobarbituric acid was heated to 100 \u0001C for 30 min and then\nrapidly cooled to 4\u0001 C in an ice-bath. After centrifugation (10 000 g\nfor 1 min at 4 \u0001C), the supernatant absorbance was read (532 nm)\nand values corresponding to non-specific absorption (600 nm) were\nsubtracted. The MDA concentration was calculated using its molar\nextinction coefficient (155 mM\u00011 cm\u00011).\nIon concentration\nFor K+ and Na+ quantification, leaf tissues were frozen with liquid\nnitrogen. After thawing, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at\n10 000 g and then for 5 min at 20 000 g to obtain the bulk tissue\nsap. Necessary dilutions were performed in order to measure K+ and\nNa+ concentrations, determined by using a Shimadzu AA-680\natomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Ltd, Kyoto,\nJapan). All measurements were performed in three replicates.\nHormone extraction and analysis\nCKs [zeatin (Z) and zeatin riboside (ZR)], IAA, and ABA were\nextracted and purified according to the method of Dobrev and\nKaminek (2002). A 1 g aliquot of leaf material was homogenized in\nliquid nitrogen and placed in 5 ml of cold (\u201320 \u0001C) extraction\nmixture of methanol\/water\/formic acid (15\/4\/1, by vol., pH 2.5).\nAfter overnight extraction at \u201320 \u0001C solids were separated by\ncentrifugation (20 000 g, 15 min) and re-extracted for 30 min in an\nadditional 5 ml of the same extraction solution. Pooled supernatants\nwere passed through a Sep-Pak Plus yC18 cartridge (SepPak Plus,\nWaters, Millford, MA, USA) to remove interfering lipids and some\nplant pigments, and evaporated either to near dryness or until the\norganic solvent was removed. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of\n1 M formic acid and applied to an Oasis MCX mixed mode (cation-\nexchange and reverse phase) column (150 mg; Waters) pre-\nconditioned with 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of 1 M formic\nacid. To separate different CKs (nucleotides, bases, ribosides, and\nglucosides) from IAA and ABA, the column was washed and eluted\nstepwise with the different appropriate solutions indicated in\nDobrev and Kaminek (2002). ABA and IAA were analysed in the\nsame fraction. After each solvent was passed through the columns,\nthey were purged briefly with air. Solvents were evaporated at\n40 \u0001C under vacuum. Samples were then dissolved in mobile phase\nA, consisting of a water\/acetonitrile\/formic acid (94.9:5:0.1 by vol.)\nmixture for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\/mass\nspectroscopy (MS) analysis. The analysis were carried out on\na HPLC\/MS system consisting of an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC\n(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a l-\nwellplate autosampler and a capillary pump, and connected to an\nAgilent Ion Trap XCT Plus mass spectrometer (Agilent Technolo-\ngies) using an electrospray (ESI) interface. Prior to injection, 100 ll\nof each fraction extracted from leaf tissues was filtered through\n13 mm diameter Millex filters with a 0.22 lm pore size nylon\nmembrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). An 8 ll aliquot of each\nsample, dissolved in mobile phase A, was injected onto a Zorbax\nSB-C18 HPLC column (5 lm, 15030.5 mm; Agilent Technolo-\ngies), held at 40 \u0001C, and eluted at a flow rate of 10 ll min\u00011.\nHormones and salt-induced senescence 3041\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nMobile phase A, consisting of water\/acetonitrile\/formic acid\n(94.9:5:0.1 by vol.), and mobile phase B, consisting of water\/\nacetonitrile\/formic acid (10:89.9:0.1 by vol.), were used for the\nchromatographic separation. The elution program maintained 100%\nA during 5 min, then a linear gradient from 0% to 6% B in 10 min,\nfollowed by another linear gradient from 6% to 100% B in 5 min,\nand finally maintained at 100% B for another 5 min. The column\nwas equilibrated with the starting composition of the mobile phase\nfor 30 min before each analytical run. The UV chromatogram was\nrecorded at 280 nm with the DAD module (Agilent Technologies).\nThe mass spectrometer was operated in the positive mode with\na capillary spray voltage of 3500 V, and a scan speed of 22 000\n(m\/z) s\u00011 from 50 to 500 m\/z. The nebulizer gas (He) pressure was\nset to 30 psi, whereas the drying gas was set to a flow of 6 l min\u00011\nat a temperature of 350 \u0001C. Mass spectra were obtained using the\nDataAnalysis program for LC\/MSD Trap Version 3.2 (Bruker\nDaltonik GmbH, Germany). For quantification of Z, ZR, ABA, and\nIAA, calibration curves were constructed for each analysed\ncomponent (0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg l\u00011) and corrected for\n0.1 mg l\u00011 internal standards: [2H5]trans-zeatin, [\n2H5]trans-zeatin\nriboside, [2H6]cis,trans-abscisic acid (Olchemin Ltd, Olomouc,\nCzech Republic), and [13C6]indole-3-acetic acid (Cambridge Iso-\ntope Laboratories Inc., Andover, MA, USA). Recovery percentages\nranged between 92% and 95%.\nACC was determined after conversion into ethylene by gas\nchromatography using an activated alumina column and an FID\ndetector (Cromatix-KNK-2000, Konik, Barcelona, Spain). ACC\nwas extracted with 80% (v\/v) ethanol and assayed by degradation\nwith alkaline hypochlorite in the presence of 5 mM HgCl2 (Casas\net al., 1989). A preliminary purification step was performed\nby passing the extract through a Dowex 50W-X8, 50\u2013100 mesh,\nH+-form resin and later recovered with 0.1 N NH4OH. The\nconversion efficiency of ACC into ethylene was calculated\nseparately by using a replicate sample containing 2.5 nmol of ACC\nas internal standard, and used for correction of data.\nEnzyme extraction and assay\nTo measure cytokinin oxidase (CKX, EC 1.5.99.12) activity, leaf\nsamples were cut into small pieces, powdered with liquid nitrogen\nusing a pestle and mortar, and extracted with a 1.5-fold excess (v\/w)\nof 0.2 M TRIS-HCl buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mM phenyl-\nmethylsulphonyl fluoride and 3% Triton X-100. Tissue debris was\nremoved by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min. The extract was\nloaded onto a Sephadex G-25 (50 3 2.5 cm) column equilibrated\nwith 0.1 M TRIS-HCl, pH 8, to remove the low molecular mass\nfraction. The protein fraction was then used to assay CKX activity.\nThe assay was performed according to the method described by\nFre\u00b4bort et al. (2002), with some modifications. Samples were\nincubated in a reaction mixture (total volume 0.6 ml in an\nEppendorf tube) of 100 mM reaction buffer (imidazole\/HCl buffer,\npH 6), 0.5 mM electron acceptor [2, 6-dichloroindophenol] and\n0.5 mM substrate, for 0.5\u201312 h at 37 \u0001C.\nTo measure cell wall invertase (CWIN, EC 3.2.1.25) activity, the\nenzyme extracts were prepared essentially as described in Balibrea\net al. (1999). Fresh leaf tissue samples (100 mg) were frozen with\nliquid nitrogen and stored at \u000120 \u0001C until analysis. Samples\ncontaining polyvinylpyrrolidone and Fontainebleau sand were\nhomogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer containing 50 mM\nHEPES-KOH (pH 7), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 2.6 mM\ndithiothreitol (DTT), 10% ethylene glycol, and 0.02% Triton X-100.\nAfter centrifugation at 20 000 g, the supernatant was discarded and\nthe pellet was washed three times and re-suspended in 30 mM\nacetate buffer (pH 5). The amount of hexoses was determined\nthrough an enzyme-linked assay monitoring NADH formation at\n340 nm, after adding 25 ll of 0.6 M sucrose and incubating at\n30 \u0001C for 15 min. The proteins were analysed in the pellet after\nsolubilization with 1 M NaCl, and the specific enzymatic activities\nwere expressed as nkat mg\u00011 protein.\nStatistical analysis\nData were subjected to an analysis of variance (ANOVA II) using\nthe SAS software (SAS System for Windows, version 8.02). The\nstatistical significance of the results was analysed by the Student\u2013\nNewman\u2013Keuls test at the 5% level.\nResults\nChlorophyll fluorescence and leaf senescence-related\nparameters\nThe evolution of chlorophyll fluorescence and senescence-\nrelated parameters during salt stress is shown in Fig. 1. In\nleaf 4 of control plants, the maximum quantum efficiency\nof PSII (Fv\/Fm) was almost constant during the growing\nperiod, whereas in salt-stressed plants, these values\nsharply decreased below those of control plants 14 d after\nsalinization (Fig. 1A). However, in the younger leaf 5, this\nsalinity-induced decrease in Fv\/Fm was delayed by 1 week\n(Fig. 1B).\nFrom the first day of salt treatment, NPQ increased\nsignificantly in leaf 4, reaching a maximum by day 15\nbefore declining during the last week (Fig. 1C) together\nwith Fv\/Fm. In control plants, NPQ increased as the leaves\naged. In leaf 5, NPQ also increased during the first week\nof salinization but less than in the older leaf 4, and it\nreached control values on day 18 before strongly in-\ncreasing on day 22, also coinciding with a significant\ndecline in Fv\/Fm (Fig. 1D).\nThe level of lipid peroxidation slowly increased with\nage in both control leaves 4 and 5, but the salt stress\nsignificantly increased it from day 15 and 22, respectively\n(Fig. 1E, F), coinciding with the decrease in Fv\/Fm\n(Fig. 1A, B).\nSodium and potassium content\nSodium was accumulated to a similar extent in both leaves\n4 and 5 (50\u201380 mM) during the first 2 weeks of\nsalinization, and also a similar strong increase (until\n150 mM) occurred at the end of the third week in both\nleaves (Fig. 2A, C).

Consequently the total (Z+ZR) CK content decreased\nwith leaf development more dramatically under salinity. At\nthe onset of the salt-induced leaf senescence (by day 15,\naccording to the decreased Fv\/Fm and MDA accumulation),\nthe Z+ZR CK content was ;50% lower than in the control\nleaves, and 70% lower than before salinization (Fig. 3).\nACC, ABA, and IAA: The concentration of the ethylene\nprecursor ACC remained almost constant (;5 ng g\u00011\nFW) in control leaves during leaf development, without\nany significant change that could be related to the onset of\nnatural senescence (Fig. 4A).

Thus, the (Z+ZR)\/ABA\nratio decreased linearly during leaf development under\ncontrol conditions (from 5 at the start of salt treatment to 1\nat the end of the experiment) (Fig. 5A). However, 1 d of\nsalt treatment induced a similar effect as 3 weeks of\ndevelopment under non-stress conditions. After 3 weeks\nof salinization the (Z+ZR)\/ABA ratio was close to zero.\nThe (Z+ZR)\/ACC ratio decreased with age in control\nleaves (Fig. 5B).

Salt\nstress significantly decreased CWIN activity in leaf 4 from\nthe first day of salt treatment (Fig. 6B).\nCorrelation analysis\nCKs (Z+ZR) and the ethylene precursor ACC contents\nand their ratio (Z+ZR\/ACC) were the best hormonal\nparameters related to senescence in leaf 4 (Table 1).\nHowever, the influence of both hormones was opposite:\nwhile Fv\/Fm was positively correlated with the CK content\nand the (Z+ZR)\/ACC ratio, a strong negative correlation\nwas found with ACC contents. On the other hand, the\nevolution of the protective parameter NPQ was correlated\npositively with ABA but negatively with CK contents and\ntheir ratios with ACC and ABA. The indicator of\noxidative stress MDA was inversely related to the\nindicator of PSII efficiency Fv\/Fm (r \u00bc \u20130.84, P > 0.01).\nIn turn, oxidative damage (MDA content) was positively\nrelated to ABA and especially to ACC contents, while\na strong and inverse correlation was found with CK\ncontent and the (Z+ZR)\/ACC ratio. Finally, while the\ncontents of the major nutrient K+ were positively\ncorrelated with Fv\/Fm and negatively with both NPQ and\nMDA in leaf 4, the contents of the toxic ion Na+ were\nonly significantly correlated with the progression of the\noxidative stress (Table 1).\nDiscussion\nThe onset of salt-induced leaf senescence seems\nindependent of bulk leaf Na+ accumulation\nIn leaf 4 of salt-stressed plants, a considerable decline in\nFv\/Fm resulting from a loss of PSII efficiency was evident\nafter 15 d of salt treatment, indicating the onset of salt-\ninduced senescence (Guiame\u00b4t et al., 2002), while in the\nyounger leaf 5 it was only observed after 22 d under\nFig. 4.

Since Na+ accumulated to a similar extent in both\nleaf 4 and leaf 5, salt-induced senescence cannot be\nwholly explained by the putative toxic effect of this ion.\nAlthough the presumably higher Na+ accumulation in\nvacuoles of the younger and more actively growing leaf 5\ncould partially account for these differences (Flowers,\n2004; Munns et al., 2006), severe toxic levels (>100 mM)\nwere only found when massive Na+ influx occurred in\nboth leaves during the last week of salinization. This\ncould be related to a general failure of the control of Na+\nexclusion at the root level and its translocation to the\nshoot, contributing to the late enhanced oxidative stress in\nleaf 4 and 5, as suggested by the positive correlation\nbetween Na+ contents and lipid peroxidation (measured as\nMDA production). Nevertheless, the decrease in K+\ncontent from the first day of salinization was more related\nthan Na+ to the different senescence-related parameters\n(Table 1).\nHowever, before the onset of the salt-induced senes-\ncence in leaf 4, the NPQ was strongly induced from day 1\nof salt treatment. This parameter is considered a protective\nprocess minimizing the photooxidative damage resulting\nfrom the absorption of excess radiation in chloroplasts\n(Gilmore, 1997). Indeed, diminished capacity of NPQ in\nleaf 4 could be related to the oxidative damage by day 15\n(Mytinova et al., 2006) and with the subsequent decrease\nin Fv\/Fm values and massive Na\n+ accumulation in both\nleaves.\nHence, other processes occurring from the first days of\nsalinization, when the osmotic effect predominates, are\nFig. 5.

These processes resulting in photooxidative\ndamage and premature leaf senescence are common to\nseveral abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, and salinity\n(Hare et al., 1997; Huner et al., 1998), while the different\nresponses found between leaves could be related to the\ndifferent sink\u2013source transitions during leaf development\n(Guiame\u00b4t et al., 2002; Cowan et al., 2005). Therefore,\nother endogenous factors influencing those processes,\nsuch as hormones, are likely to be influencing the onset\nand progression of the salt-induced senescence.\nLow cytokinin levels promote salt-induced senescence\nbut are not the only signal\nThe changing levels of major CKs in tomato (Z+ZR) was\nthe hormonal parameter best related to Fv\/Fm, NPQ, and\nMDA (Table 1). The involvement of cytokinins in the\nprevention of leaf senescence has been extensively studied\nin different plant species (Gan and Amasino, 1995;\nBalibrea et al., 2004; He et al., 2005; Guo and Gan,\n2007; Rivero et al., 2007). As a consequence, it is very\nlikely that the large drop in CK contents (especially ZR)\nin salinized leaves (Fig. 3C) could contribute to the\nprogression of senescence under stress. This decrease\nmay be the result of less synthesis, reduced transport of\nroot-synthesized CKs, and\/or increased breakdown of\nCKs (Werner et al., 2006; Havlova et al., 2008). Initially,\ndecreased transport of CKs from the roots could be\nresponsible for the decrease in the leaves, as suggested by\nthe decrease of both CKs in root xylem sap under salinity\n(data not shown). However, the strong decrease observed\nin leaf ZR content by day 15 of salt treatment can also be\nexplained by an induction of CKX activity (Fig. 6A). The\nrole of CKX could be the maintenance of an optimal level\nof CKs for growth adaptation to the stress conditions (e.g.\nshift in shoot to root assimilate partitioning) and\/or\nresetting a CK signalling system to a basal level (Werner\net al., 2001; Roitsch et al., 2003). In this regard, the\nconcomitant decrease of the CWIN activity (Fig. 6B),\na key factor in the control of senescence by CKs (Balibrea\net al., 2004), also argues in favour of the role of the low\ncontent of these hormones in the progression of salt-\ninduced senescence (Gan and Amasino, 1995), but it is\nnot a major signal triggering its onset (Werner et al. 2003;\nMunne\u00b4-Bosch and Alegre, 2004).\nIAA and ABA are not the major signals for salt-induced\nsenescence\nAlthough auxin effects on abscission and senescence were\nfirst reported >50 years ago (for a review, see Noode\u00b4n,\n1988), the involvement of this hormone in senescence is\nmuch less understood than that of ABA, ethylene, or CKs,\nand it is difficult to conclude that it antagonizes\nsenescence (Gan, 2004). In the present study, the highest\nIAA levels in salinized leaves coincided with the onset of\nsenescence, suggesting it promoted this process. In re-\nbuttal of this notion, IAA levels of salinized plants were\n50% lower than in control leaves. Therefore, although\na low IAA content could stimulate senescence on the basis\nthat this compound has been generally seen as a senes-\ncence-retarding factor (Schippers et al., 2007), it seems\nunlikely to be a primary factor in the onset of salt-induced\nsenescence, as suggested by the lack of correlation with\nany of the related parameters (Table 1), and more work is\nneeded to answer this question.\nOn first inspection, the increased leaf ABA concentra-\ntion from the first day of salinization may be due to\na transient loss of leaf turgor. However, later in the\nexperiment leaf turgor was probably sustained by ionic\nuptake (Pe\u00b4rez-Alfocea et al., 2000). Since leaf ABA\naccumulation during salinity occurred even when leaf\nturgor was sustained by root pressurization (Kefu et al.,\n1991) and osmotic shock increased leaf ABA concentra-\ntion 4-fold after 3 d even when leaf turgor was maintained\n(Go\u00b4mez-Cadenas et al., 1998), leaf ABA accumulation\nprobably occurs due to root ABA synthesis and export.\nAlthough this hormone could certainly influence senes-\ncence, as suggested by the positive correlation with both\nNPQ and MDA, it can be rejected as a primary signal for\nthe onset of this process because its early increase\npreceded both the decline in Fv\/Fm and the MDA\naccumulation, and even a protective effect on senescence\ncannot be excluded. However, the first indirect but\nimmediate effect of ABA on senescence may occur by\nABA-induced stomatal closure (Dodd, 2005) decreasing\nphotosynthesis. ABA could also provoke carbohydrate\naccumulation by putatively blocking sucrose export from\nmature leaves (Estruch et al., 1989; Pe\u00b4rez-Alfocea and\nLarher, 1995), contributing to osmotic adjustment during\nthe early (osmotic) phase of salinity (Balibrea et al.,\n2000). Indeed, the role of ABA in the onset of leaf\nsenescence in Arabidopsis appears to be coupled to\nchanges in metabolic fluxes (Schippers et al., 2007),\nalthough its effect on sugar transport is still controversial,\nas indicated above. Low ABA transport from the roots\nand high CK contents in the leaves (especially ZR) were\npostulated to delay natural senescence in stay-green maize\nphenotypes (He et al., 2005). Moreover, while drought\nstress-induced senescence in tobacco was related to\nincreases in both ABA and CKX activity and to a re-\nduction in active CKs, the increase in CK content through\nthe senescent-induced (SAG12) or constitutive (35S)\nexpression of the ZOG1 gene decreased CKX activity and\ndelayed both ABA accumulation and senescence pro-\ngression in lower leaves (Havlova et al., 2008). An\ninteraction between ABA and CKs is also plausible under\nsalinity, since it has been described that ABA increases\nCKX gene expression (Brugie`re et al., 2003). Hence, the\nHormones and salt-induced senescence 3047\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nABA increase in leaves could be partially responsible for\nthe decreased CK contents, thus indirectly enhancing the\nsalt-induced senescence. Moreover, since CKs counteract\nABA-induced stomatal closure (Dodd, 2005) and inhibit\nthe glucose repression response on photosynthesis (Moore\net al., 2003), a low (Z+ZR)\/ABA ratio would enhance the\nnon-stomatal photosynthetic inhibition under salinity\n(Balibrea et al., 2000), as suggested by the negative\ncorrelation found with NPQ (Table 1).\nHowever, the effect of ABA on the progress of\nsenescence remains unclear and seems to depend on the\nplant species, growth conditions, and interactions with\nother hormones. In the ABA-deficient tomato mutant\nsitiens, salinity promoted leaf senescence more than in\nthe wild type (Ma\u00a8ke\u00a8la et al., 2003), presumably due to\na higher ethylene evolution (Sharp et al., 2000), while the\nhigher incidence of leaf death was not explained by Na+\naccumulation (Ma\u00a8ke\u00a8la et al., 2003). Moreover, it has also\nbeen proposed that ABA could provide a protective role\nagainst salinity and high intensity light stress in Arabi-\ndopsis (Cramer, 2002), which can be related to the\ninduction of antioxidant defences (Hu et al., 2006). On\nthe other hand, various Arabidopsis mutants defective in\neither ABA biosynthesis or signalling have not shown\nmeasurable effects on the timing or progression of leaf\nsenescence under different environmental stresses (Hensel\net al., 1993; Guo and Gan, 2007). Further studies are\nrequired to gain insights into the role of ABA in salt-\ninduced leaf senescence.\nIncrease in the ethylene precursor ACC coincides with\nFv\/Fm decrease and oxidative damage in salinized\nleaves\nEthylene has long been considered a key hormone in\nregulating the onset of senescence (Zacarias and Reid,\n1990), and is also suspected to be involved in salt-induced\nsenescence (Munns, 2002a; Wi and Park, 2002). In the\npresent study, leaf ACC concentration sharply increased\nafter 15 d of salt treatment, coincident with the decline in\nboth Fv\/Fm and NPQ and with the appearance of oxidative\ndamage, which indicate the onset of salt-induced leaf\nsenescence in that leaf. Although increases in ACC,\nethylene evolution, and the activity of the enzyme\nresponsible for this conversion (ACC oxidase) are usually\nconcomitant (Go\u00b4mez-Cadenas et al., 1998; Dodd, 2005;\nvan der Graaf et al., 2006), the relationship between\nincreased ACC levels and onset of senescence should be\nconsidered with caution since leaf ethylene evolution was\nnot directly measured. However, the relationship between\nACC, ethylene, and senescence has been widely supported\nusing physiological (Zacarias and Reid, 1990; Ella et al.,\n2003) and genetic approaches. Leaf senescence has been\ndelayed in either transgenic tomato plants with reduced\nethylene biosynthesis (John et al., 1995) or mutants with\nreduced sensitivity to ethylene (Zacarias and Reid, 1990;\nGrbic and Bleecker, 1995). However, constitutive over-\nproduction of ethylene in Arabidopsis and tomato plants\ndid not cause precocious senescence, suggesting that\nethylene alone is not sufficient to initiate leaf senescence\n(Grbic and Bleecker, 1995). It has been postulated that\nage-dependent factors are required for ethylene-regulated\nleaf senescence (He and Gan, 2002). In this regard, the\nprior decreases in CK content (Fig. 3) could sensitize the\nsenescence process to ethylene. Indeed, the (Z+ZR)\/ACC\nratio was strongly correlated with the senescence-related\nparameters (Table 1), suggesting that both hormones are\nimportant in this process. It is also interesting to note that\nincreased ACC concentration was prior (day 15) to\nmassive Na+ entry into the leaves (day 22) and it has been\nreported that ethylene receptors (e.g. NTHK1) affect\nsensitivity to salinity and modify Na+\/K+ homeostasis\n(Cao et al., 2006). These data suggest that ethylene and its\nprecursor ACC might play a role in the onset of salt-\ninduced leaf senescence, as suggested by the strong\ncorrelation found with the decline both in Fv\/Fm and in\nMDA production (Figs 1A, C, E and 4A, Table 1).\nConclusion\nThis comprehensive study on the changing levels of\nseveral major phytohormones during salt-induced leaf\nsenescence of tomato provides new insights about the\nsequence of physiological events involved in this process\nthat directly reduces crop productivity. Early events during\nthe osmotic phase of salt stress promote leaf senescence\nprior to the massive accumulation of toxic ions. Indirect\neffects due to an initial ABA accumulation and IAA\ndecrease, followed by a strong and continuous reduction\nin CK contents certainly favours the progression of\nsenescence in salinized leaves, but it is the ethylene\nprecursor ACC that is the major hormonal signal that is\ntemporally correlated with the onset of the oxidative\ndamage and the subsequent chlorophyll fluorescence\ndecrease and, perhaps, the massive Na+ accumulation.\nExogenous or endogenous manipulation of these hor-\nmones could improve crop salt tolerance by delaying both\nsenescence during the initial phase of salinity and the\nsubsequent toxic effects. Since salinity induced simulta-\nneous changes in several hormone groups (Figs 3, 4),\ndissecting the role of a specific hormone in salinity-\ninduced senescence will require the use of transgenics,\nmutants, or other genetic variability to increase or decrease\nthe level of the hormone of interest. Such experiments will\naim to resolve whether it is the basal hormone level prior\nto the imposition of stress, or hormonal response to\nsalinity that is important in mediating senescence or\nwhether these variables are correlated. However, such\nexperiments assume a priori that hormones are regulating\nsenescence and measurement of hormonal relations in\ngenetic material that differs in salinity-induced senescence\nmay provide a complementary approach.\n3048 Ghanem et al.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are very grateful to Dr A Torrecillas (CAID,\nUniversidad de Murcia) for his help with hormonal analyses, to the\nFonds National de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (Belgium) and\nto the Fundacio\u00b4n Se\u00b4neca (Comunidad Auto\u00b4noma de Murcia, Spain)\nfor a travel grant to M.E.G. and F.P.A., respectively, and to the\nCSIC (Spain) for a research grant to AA (I3P Program).
