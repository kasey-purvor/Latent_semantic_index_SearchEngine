Many people with a disability or limiting long-term illness \nare out of work for long periods of time as around one third of health-related benefit \nclaims last over 5 years (Department of Work  & Pensions, 2003a). The high numbers \nof people out of work and claiming benefits due to limiting long-term illness or \ndisability is a salient policy concern and increasing the employment rates of people \nwith a disability or a limiting long-term illness has been at the centre of successive \ngovernment approaches to welfare reform (Floyd & Curtis, 2000; Hyde, 2000; Blair, \n2002). Policy interventions have largely focused on encouraging the person with a \ndisability or limiting long-term illness to take up employment \u2013 via a reduction in \nhealth related benefit levels, the tightening up of entitlement criteria, or the increased \nuse of welfare to work programmes such as the New Deal for Disabled People \n(Department of Work  & Pensions, 1998; HMSO, 1999; Smith & Twomey, 2002). \nThe introduction of anti-discrimination legislation, in the form of the 1995 Disability \nDiscrimination Act (DDA), however, focuses instead upon the employment context \nand the discrimination that people with a disability or a limiting long-term illness face \nin the employment market (Gardiner, 1997).  \n \n 5 \nThe DDA makes it unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against disabled persons in connection \nwith employment, the provision of goods, facilities and services, or the disposal or \nmanagement of premises\u201d (HMSO, 1995). Under the Act a person is regarded as \ndisabled if they have \u201ca physical or mental impairment that has a substantial and long-\nterm adverse effect on his\/her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities\u201d (see \nBox 1) (HMSO, 1995; Department of Work  & Pensions 2003b).\n1 2\n The employment \nprovisions of the Act, which came into force in December 1996, make it illegal for a \nUK employer with 15 or more employees to discriminate unjustifiably against a \nperson on grounds of their disability either in recruitment or in the treatment of \nexisting employees.  \n \nThere has been much debate about the adequacy of these employment provisions in \nchallenging discrimination and increasing access to paid employment for people with \na disability or limiting long-term illness (Barnes & Oliver, 1995; Gooding, C, 2000; \nBarnes, 2002; Woodhams & Corby, 2003). However, there is little evidence on the \nactual impact of the DDA on the employment rates of people with a disability or a \nlimiting long-term illness. The few empirical studies that have been carried out have \ntypically examined either the legal implications of the DDA (Delany & Moody, \n1999), or the views of people with disabilities and employers regarding the impact of \nthe Act on employment practices (Whitfield, 1997; Jackson, Furnham & Willen; \n2000).\n3 4\n This study therefore set out to provide a quantitative evaluation of whether \nthe DDA has made an impact on the employment rates of working age men and \nwomen (18-60\/65 years) with a disability or a limiting long-term illness. Specifically, \nwe were interested in the extent to which the legislation might have decreased the \ndisparity between the employment rates of people defined as (i) \u201edisabled\u201f (people \n 6 \nwith a limiting long-term illness or disability), and (ii) \u201enot disabled\u201f (people with no \nlimiting long-term illness or disability). \n \nMethods \nData extraction \nThis study utilised data from the annual General Household Survey (GHS) over a \ntwelve year period, 1990 \u2013 2002. The GHS is a multi-purpose continuous cross-\nsectional survey carried out by the Social Survey Division of the Office for National \nStatistics (ONS) that collects information on a range of topics from households in the \nUK (Office for National Statistics, 2003b).  Topics include personal, demographic, \nhousehold, employment, health and income data.  The GHS is administered as a face-\nto-face interview and during the period of analysis the sample size ranged from 19193 \nto 24657 with response rates ranging from 72% to 82%.  \n \nBefore and after data relating to the DDA definition of disability is not available and \ntherefore in this study we have used the definition of disability adopted in the GHS \n(see Box 2). The utilisation of the GHS definition ensures that a continuous definition \nof disability is used for both before and after the DDA and that the definition is robust \nagainst changes to the definition of disability that the DDA may have created (for \nexample, from 1997 the Labour Force Survey definition of disability was changed to \nreflect that of the DDA). Data from 10 surveys were used (the GHS was not \nconducted in 1997 and 1999) to provide employment information both before and \nafter the DDA.   \n \n 7 \nFor the purpose of analysis for the current study we extracted information from the \nGHS relating to disability, employment status and various demographic details \nincluding age.  Disability was defined as \u201cany long-standing illness or disability that \nhas resulted in limited activity\u201d (\u201edisabled\u201f).  We compared these people with those \nwith no activity limiting long-term illness or disability (\u201enot disabled\u201f).  Employment \nstatus, as in the GHS, was defined as \u201eworking\u201f (in current paid employment) or \u201enot \nworking\u201f (not currently in paid employment). The proportion of people defined as \n\u201edisabled\u201f according to the definition used in the GHS was similar over the 12 year \nstudy period ranging from 17.5% to 20.5%. Only data pertaining to people of working \nage were selected (aged 18-60 years in women and 18-65 years in men). \n \nData analysis \nEmployment rates for the 10 years of GHS data collection were calculated for \n\u201edisabled\u201f and \u201enot disabled\u201f.  The rates were then directly standardised for age using \nthe European Standard Population to take account of differences in age structure of \nthe groups (prevalence of long-term illness and disability tends to increase with age). \n95% confidence intervals were calculated for the standardised employment rates using \na normal approximation and standard errors obtained using the method described by \nBreslow and Day (1987). Differences in employment rates between the \u201enot ill\/ \ndisabled\u201f group and the \u201edisabled\u201f group were then calculated and plotted for the 10 \nyears of GHS data collection (employment rate for \u201enot\/ill disabled\u201f minus \nemployment rate for \u201edisabled\u201f).  To ascertain whether there was a significant \ndifference between employment rates before and after the DDA in people defined as \nbeing \u201edisabled\u201f, the average employment rate from 1991 to 1996 was compared to \nthe average employment rate from 1998 to 2001 using the Mann-Whitney U test for \n 8 \nnonparametric data.  The analysis was repeated for differences in employment rates \nbetween \u201edisabled\u201f and \u201enot disabled\u201f groups. SPSS v11 statistical software was used \nto carry out the analysis. \n \nResults \nAge standardised employment rates over the 12 year period are shown in Figure 1.  \nFor people defined as \u201enot disabled\u201f there appeared to have been a slight increase in \nthe proportion of people employed from 1990 (78.3%) to 2001 (82.4%), although \nthere was a dip in employment rate from 1993 to 1995 which perhaps reflects a period \nof economic recession in the UK.  For people defined as \u201edisabled\u201f the picture was \nquite different.  The highest employment rate was recorded for 1990 (54.3%) and over \nthe 12 year period rates declined reaching 45.9 per cent in 2001 (Figure 1). \n \nThe differences between employment rates between the \u201edisabled\u201f and the \u201enot ill\u201f \ngroups over the 12 years of data collection are shown in Figure 2.  \n \nFrom 1990 up to 1996 the percentage difference in age standardised employment rates \nfluctuated between 21.1% in 1994 and 36.5% in 2001.  However, from 1998 the \ndisparity between employment rates increased steadily from 34.8% in 1998 to a 12 \nyear peak of 36.5% in 2001 (p<0.05). \n \nTable 1 shows the average employment rate of \u201edisabled\u201f people pre and post the full \napplication of the DDA after December 1996.  The average employment rate for \n\u201edisabled\u201f people for the 7 years prior to the DDA (1990-1996) was found to be \nslightly higher than for the period following the Act; 1998 to 2001 (49.4%; 95% CI = \n 9 \n47.4%-51.4% vs 46.3%; 95% CI = 44.1%-48.5% respectively) although this was not \nfound to be statistically significant.  The average difference between employment \nrates (\u201enot disabled\u201f minus \u201edisabled\u201f) was, however, found to be significantly lower \nbetween 1990 and 1996 (27.8%; 95% CI = 26.2%-29.4%) than between 1998 and \n2001 (35.4%; 95%CI = 33.7%-37.2% respectively; p<0.05).   \n \nDiscussion \nThis study is the first to investigate the influence of the DDA in relation to the \nemployment rates of people with a disability in the UK. It has also considered \nwhether the DDA has reduced the disparity in employment rates between people with \na disability or limiting long-term illness and those without.  By utilising national \npopulation based data from the GHS we found no evidence of a positive effect of the \nDDA on employment rates. In fact, the disparity between employment rates of people \nwith and without a disability has increased.     \n \nThese results are consistent with criticisms levied against the DDA by both academics \nand disability activists (Barnes & Oliver, 1995; Gooding, C, 2000; Barnes, 2002; \nWoodhams & Corby, 2003). Since its enactment in 1995, the DDA has been \ncompared unfavourably with its American counterpart (1990 Americans with \nDisabilities Act), the employment quota systems of some European countries, and \nother UK anti-discrimination legislation such as the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act or \nthe 1976 Race Relations Act (Goss, Goss & Adam-Smith; 2000). The most frequently \nnoted shortcomings of the Act are the exemption of small firms (under 15 employees) \n(Floyd & Curtis, 2000), the \u201ereasonable adjustment\u201f clause that enables employers to \njustify some non-adherence (Jackson, Furnham & Willen, 2000), the monitoring of \n 10 \ncompliance by employers (Woodhams & Corby, 2003), and the narrow definition of \ndisability that it utilises (Oliver, 1998). The Act also places the burden of proof upon \nthe individual with a disability as they are required to show that they are (i) disabled \nunder the terms of the Act and (ii) that they were discriminated against on this basis. \nIt has been argued that, in its present form, the DDA is inadequate and that further \nlegislation is essential to improve the employment situation of people with a disability \nin the future (Barnes & Oliver, 1995; Oliver & Barnes, 1998; Barnes, 2002). \n \nMore widely, the study also raises questions about the utility of anti-discriminatory \nlegislation, such as the DDA, in increasing the employment rates of people with a \ndisability. Internationally, such legislation has become an increasingly popular policy \noption: the USA introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, \nAustralia enacted a Disability Discrimination Act in 1992, and in Europe, Sweden \n(1999) and the Netherlands (2003) have also begun to adopt anti-discriminatory \nlegislation. A large motivation behind the development of anti-discriminatory \nlegislation has been the concern about low employment rates amongst people with a \ndisability and associated social security costs (OECD, 2003). The results of our study, \nreinforced by other research such as that on the ADA (DeLeire, 2000; Russell, 2002), \nsuggests that such legislation may not achieve this goal. Anti-discriminatory and civil \nrights based legislation may have other important effects, such as enabling access to \nservices, but in terms of increasing employment rates, the research evidence suggests \nthat legislation may not be the most effective means of increasing employment \namongst people with a disability or limiting long-term illness (DeLeire, 2000; Russell, \n2002). Other policy interventions, such as return to work (Bloch and Prins, 2001), \n 11 \nvocational rehabilitation or welfare to work (Bambra et al., in press) may be more \nsuccessful alternatives. \n \nLimitations \nOne limitation of using survey data for this analysis is that it relies on self-reported \nhealth and employment status and such self-reports can be subject to some \ninaccuracy. For example, research on self-reported limiting long-term illness has \nsuggested that answers are most strongly associated with physical rather than \npsychological health (Cohen, Forbes & Garraway, 1995) and with more serious health \nconditions as opposed to less serious conditions (Manor, Matthews & Power, 2001). \nThe reliance on self-reported health status in the GHS may then have resulted in an \nunderestimation of the number of people with a limiting long-term illness or \ndisability. This would only result in bias if the same people were to also inaccurately \nreport their employment status. Unfortunately, it was not possible to investigate \nwhether this was the case. \n \n\u201eDisability\u201f is defined in different ways by various studies (Smith & Twomey, 2002; \nOliver, 1998; OECD, 2003). The definition used in the current study was based on \nquestions used by the GHS relating to a long-term illness or disability that had \nresulted in limitation of daily activity (see Box 2). Unfortunately this does not fully \nincorporate the definition of disability specifically utilised by the DDA.  Since 1997 \nthe UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) has used the DDA definition to frame its question \nabout limiting long term illness and disability.  We compared age standardised rates \nof self-reported disability using the GHS definition with those in the LFS \n(incorporating the DDA classification of \u201edisability\u201f) for the years 1998, 2000 and \n 12 \n2001. In both surveys approximately 1\/5 of respondents reported a disability for the \nthree time periods.  Upon examination of self-reported employment status by people \nreporting a disability we observed similar rates between the GHS and LFS (1998 = \n45.8% vs 45.6%; 2000 = 47.2% vs 47.0%; 2001 = 45.9% vs 47.9% respectively).  It is \ntherefore likely that the definition of disability used in the GHS includes the majority \nof people defined as being disabled by the DDA. \n \nIt has only been possible for the data in this study to cover a short time period (1998 \u2013 \n2001) post- the implementation of the employment aspects of the DDA in December \n1996. It is difficult to assess the impact of a macro-level policy like the DDA in such \na time span and it may be the case that the Act needs longer in order to make a \ndetectable effect on the employment rates of people with a disability or limiting long-\nterm illness and, indeed to close the long-standing employment gap between this \ngroup and those without a disability or limiting long-term illness.  \n \nIt is hard to draw any definitive conclusions from this study regarding the impact of \nthe DDA because we are restricted to data concerning employment rates and have no \nother information directly concerning the implementation or experience of the DDA. \nFurthermore, as the GHS is a cross-sectional survey, it has not been possible to \nidentify the impact of the DDA on people\u201fs individual employment histories. This \nstudy has also only examined the aggregate impact of the DDA on the employment \nrates of people with a disability or limiting long-term illness, it has not examined any \ndifferential impact that the Act may have had by such variables as age, gender or \nsocio-economic class. Future studies to investigate these aspects are planned. \n \n 13 \nConclusion \nThis investigation has analysed routine population survey data pre- and post- the \nimplementation of the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act.  \nWe have shown that this legislation has not yet increased the employment rates of \npeople with a limiting long-term illness or disability or been effective in closing the \ngap that exists between their employment rates and those of people without limiting \nlong-term illness or disability.  It seems likely that additions to the legislation are \nrequired if the Act is to be a more effective policy tool in increasing the employment \nrates of people with limiting long term illness or disability. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nWe would like to thank the UK Data Archive for access to data from the General \nHousehold Surveys.
