Interest in this material has been re-\nkindled recently by the discovery of extraordinary magne-\ntoresistance ~EMR! in a composite metal\u2013semiconductor\nstructure, which has made possible the fabrication of entirely\ndifferent types of macroscopic magnetic sensors for read\nhead applications.1,2 As the EMR effect at low magnetic\nfield, B, is proportional to (mB)2, it is desirable to have a\nmaterial that has high RT mobility. A thin surface-active re-\ngion is preferred in order to maximize the effective informa-\ntion storage medium bit field. High mobility thin InSb is also\ninteresting for spintronic applications because of the high\nspin-orbit coupling and large electron g factor ~250.6!. Re-\ncent measurements of the spin lifetime3 in n-type degenerate\nepilayers of InSb are encouraging, suggesting a RT spin life-\ntime of the order of 300 ps.\nUnfortunately, InSb itself cannot be used as a substrate\ndue to its very large parallel conduction. Semi-insulating\nGaAs has been widely employed as the substrate for InSb\ngrowth.4\u201311 The main obstacle to acquiring high mobility of\nthe hybrid system comes from the strain at the InSb\/GaAs\ninterface due to the large lattice mismatch of 14.6%, which is\nparticularly detrimental to thin films. Kanisawa et al.12 ob-\ntained high mobility thin InSb layers on GaAs~111!A sub-\nstrates by a two-step growth process ~referred to as the \u2018\u2018NTT\nrecipe\u2019\u2019!. Nevertheless, this technique failed to improve InSb\nfilms grown on GaAs~100!. In this letter, we describe the\nresults of a method for InSb growth by molecular beam ep-\nitaxy ~MBE!. It is greatly helpful to the improvement of\nunintentionally doped InSb layers ~60\u2013100 nm! directly\ngrown on GaAs~100! substrates by producing smoother sur-\nfaces and reducing the dislocation donor density.\nThin InSb films were deposited on semi-insulating\nGaAs~100! substrates in a VG Semicon V80 MBE chamber.\nReflection high-energy electron diffraction ~RHEED! was\nused for in situ calibration of the V\/III flux ratio, i.e., Sb4 \/In,\nand monitoring InSb surface morphology. The growth proce-\ndure in this work, referred to as the \u2018\u2018Imperial recipe,\u2019\u2019 fol-\nlows the two-step mode of the NTT recipe with some addi-\ntional treatment. First of all, a GaAs buffer layer was not\nrequired, as it shows no apparent improvement of mobility.\nThe growth rate of InSb was kept at 0.66 mm per hour. It has\nbeen reported that, for low substrate temperature (Tsub\n,400 \u00b0C), two-dimensional mirror-like InSb was obtained\nunder a low V\u2013III flux ratio ~1\u20132.5!,4,5 This is due to the\nlower volatility and longer surface lifetime of Sb compared\nto As under these circumstances. An optimized Sb4 \/In flux\nratio of 1.3 was employed throughout the work as it always\nprovides the highest mobility samples.\nThe present work lies in the optimization of the LT layer\nthickness and an additional anneal step. The LT growth of\nundoped InSb ~20 nm! was performed at the minimum tem-\nperature capable of maintaining binary growth, which in our\ncase was found at 300 \u00b0C.13 The growth of 20 nm of InSb at\nthe LT stage always started in the Volmer\u2013Weber mode, i.e.,\nthree-dimensional. The RHEED patterns remained spotty\nand streaky patterns started to appear at the end of the LT\nstage. The sample was then annealed at a specified tempera-\nture for fixed time. Streaky patterns of ~133! reconstruction\nwere observed. The temperature was then adjusted for the\nHT growth step. In order to determine the optimum tempera-\nture for the HT growth step, a series of 300-nm-thick InSb\nepilayers was studied as a function of growth temperature by\nthe measurement of RT mobility and full width at half maxi-\nmum of the x-ray rocking curves.13,14 As a result, the HT\ngrowth of a set of InSb films ~60 nm\u20132 mm!, was performed\nat the optimized temperature of 380 \u00b0C. At the conclusion of\nthe growth, the Sb4 flux was sustained until the sample tem-\nperature fell to 290 \u00b0C. The growth temperature was cali-\nbrated by monitoring the \u2018\u2018system-measured\u2019\u2019 temperature at\nwhich the surface reconstruction during homoepitaxial\ngrowth changed between \u2018\u2018pseudo ~133!\u2019\u2019 and ~234! when\nthe samples were cooled from the annealing temperature to\nthat of the HT step. The temperature was also periodically\na!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\nl.cohen@imperial.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS VOLUME 84, NUMBER 22 31 MAY 2004\n44630003-6951\/2004\/84(22)\/4463\/3\/$22.00 \u00a9 2004 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130.

Films were sandblasted to cloverleaf van\nder Pauw patterns with 5 mm diameter.\nHall measurements were performed in a magnetic field\nof 10 mT between RT and 77 K. All samples were n type in\nthe measured temperature range. The relationship between\nRT mobility and film thickness is summarized in Fig. 1~a!, in\ncomparison with those of samples grown elsewhere.4\u201311 All\nresults are calculated using a single-carrier single-layer\nmodel. The overall trend shown by the samples is known as\nthe Universal Curve. The samples grown by the Imperial\nrecipe exhibit considerable improvement in the range 60\u2013\n300 nm. A 100-nm-thick sample ~U044! was grown follow-\ning the NTT recipe and the resulting mobility duplicates the\nNTT(100) growth result @see Fig. 1~a!\u2014open square sym-\nbol#, confirming that this method provides a genuine im-\nprovement. Atomic force microscope ~AFM! images13 con-\nfirm that the Imperial recipe produces smoother surfaces\nthan the one following the NTT recipe by one order of mag-\nnitude with clear atomic growth terraces of height 0.6\u20130.8\nnm.\nThe carrier concentration, n , calculated from the single-\ncarrier single-layer model as a function of thickness is shown\nin Fig. 1~b!. Also shown are the NTT results for ~111!A and\n~100! growth, which were extracted using a similar model.\nThe ~111!A growth suppresses edge dislocations which are\nthought to be responsible for the increase of n at the\ninterface.12 The lower apparent, i.e., experimentally mea-\nsured, n from the Imperial ~100! growth suggests a lower\ndensity of such dislocations, which is consistent with the\nimproved mobility. Note that there is surface depletion be-\ncause the Fermi level is known to be pinned close to the\nvalence band edge at the surface of the material. Surface\ndepletion will have an increasing role for thinner samples\nand would increase the apparent n but would not affect the\nvalue of the apparent mobility. We do not take the surface\ndepletion into account in the analysis that follows.\nA depth profile of the mobility and carrier density as a\nfunction of the distance from the interface can be obtained\nby using a differential approach.14 This method assumes that,\nfor a series of N samples of various total thicknesses tn ,\n(n51 to N , with all tn.tn21), each sample of thickness tn\ncan be considered as consisting of a top layer of thickness\n(tn2tn21), and an underlying layer with the same properties\nas the sample of thickness tn21 . Equations ~1! and ~2! give\nthe apparent mobility and bulk carrier concentration for the\ntop layer, the subscripts \u2018\u20181\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u20182\u2019\u2019 denote the contribution\nof that of the underlying and the top layers, respectively,\nm25\nn\u00afm\u00af 2d1Sqn1m1\n2d1\nn\u00afm\u00af d2n1m1d1\n, ~1!\nn25\n1\nd2\n~n\u00afm\u00af d2n1m1d1!2\nn\u00afm\u00af 2d1Sqn1m1\n2d1\n. ~2!\nNote that n\u00af and m\u00af are the apparent values extracted from the\nsingle-carrier single-layer model, d is the total thickness\n(d11d2), and Sq is the sign of the charge of the carriers of\nthe interfacial layer ~11 for holes and 21 for electrons!. The\napparent properties of the top layer can then be calculated by\ntaking n\u00af and m\u00af as the apparent properties of the layer of\nthickness tn , and n1 and m1 as those of the sample of thick-\nness tn21 . The depth profile is achieved by repeating this for\nlayers tn21 and tn22 , and so on, and the RT results are\nshown in Fig. 2. It is clear that, above 100 nm from the\ninterface, the carrier density remains approximately constant\nat 231016 cm23, which is the intrinsic bulk value, but be-\nlow this thickness the carrier density rapidly increases. This\nis consistent with the statement that donors arise from\ndislocation-related states.12 There is no corresponding abrupt\nchange in mobility at this thickness, which gradually de-\ncreases with decreasing thickness with values 40% greater\nthan those obtained from single carrier model.\nThe combination of increasing apparent carrier density\nand decreasing apparent mobility can be a signature of a\np-type interfacial layer.15 A further analysis of the interface\nis achieved using a two-layer model at high field, which is\ndescribed as,\nrxy5\nsxy\nsxx\n2 1sxy\n2 , ~3!\nsxy5\nns2em2\n2B\n11~m2B !2\n2\nSqns1em1\n2B\n11~m1B !2\nand\nFIG. 1.

Figure 3 shows the experimentally obtained\nRT values of rxy for a 100 nm InSb film with a 20 nm LT\ninterfacial layer. Assuming the interfacial layer is donor-like,\na best fit to the experimental data can be easily achieved.\nThis was attained using the constraint that the parameters\ngive a zero field rxy equal to that of the experimentally mea-\nsured value. If the interfacial layer is acceptor-like a best fit\nto the experiment data could not be achieved, a fit ~weighted\nto the low field region! is shown by the dash line in Fig. 3.\nTo summarize, the electrical and structural properties of\nthin InSb films grown on GaAs~100! by an improved growth\nmethod have been investigated. Although three-dimensional\nisland growth cannot be suppressed, we have greatly im-\nproved the electrical properties over a thickness range around\n100 nm. The two-layer model with its high-field approxima-\ntion demonstrates that the InSb at the interface with GaAs is\ndonor-like and electrical properties of the layer change con-\ntinuously away from this interface, which is consistent with\nthe expected dislocation density distribution in this material.\nThe letter is dedicated to Professor R.
