INTRODUCTION\nS CHIZOPHRENIA is one of the most disabling and per-sistent mental illnesses, often striking in the youth of the\nsufferer, and having potentially severe effects on the sufferer\u2019s\nfamily or other caregivers. The disease has huge effects on the\nquality of life, employment, and productivity of sufferers. Re-\nsearch over the last three decades has led to a wide variety of\nfindings on the potential causes of schizophrenia, including ge-\nnetic associations, neurochemical abnormalities, neuroanatom-\nical deficits as revealed by neuroimaging procedures, cognitive\ndeficits, and many environmental and social factors that may\nbe implicated in the disease. However, there is no single co-\nhesive theoretical framework joining genes, biochemistry, cog-\nnition, and psychological outcome, i.e., a framework for inte-\ngrating the biological and psychological aspects of the disease.\nAlthough the introduction of atypical antipsychotic drugs has\neliminated many of the serious sedative and motor side effects\nseen with the older antipsychotics, the main focus of clinical\ntreatment still remains control of psychotic symptoms. There\nare no methods of preventing this debilitating illness from de-\nveloping. Conventional therapies have not targeted the cognitive\ndeficits that appear to be significant in schizophrenia and that are\ncorrelated with neuroimaging findings. Therefore, a challenge\nexists to provide a model for understanding schizophrenia that\nManuscript received September 26, 2006; revised May 4, 2007 and July 20,\n2007; accepted August 28, 2007.

Neuroimaging Studies of the Thalamus\nNeuroimaging research into the etiology of schizophrenia\nover the last three decades has identified regional brain ab-\nnormalities implicated in the neurocognitive and behavioral\nsymptomatology of this devastating brain disease. One of\nthe emerging key brain structures that participates in neural\ncircuits hypothesized to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia is\nthe thalamus. An indication of the position of the thalamus\nin the brain is given in Fig. 1. In this figure [taken from an\nmagnetic resonance (MR) image, with the front of the head\nto the top of the page], the left thalamus is surrounded by the\nbroken line (the right thalamus can be seen adjacent to it). The\nthalamus has traditionally been considered as a relay center for\nafferent sensory pathways, regulating and transmitting periph-\neral stimulation to areas of the cortex. However, it also plays\na crucial role in memory, executive functioning and attention.\nFor example, gray matter density in the thalamus is positively\ncorrelated with IQ in healthy young people [2].\nNeuroimaging studies have demonstrated somewhat incon-\nsistent thalamic alterations in schizophrenia, including changes\nin thalamic volume [3] and connectivity [4] as shown by\nMRI; abnormalities in glucose metabolism in the mediodorsal,\nanterior, and pulvinar regions of the thalamus as measured by\nblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) [5]\u2013[9]; differences in thalamic\nmean diffusivity as revealed by MRI diffusion tensor imaging\n[10]; reductions in volume and\/or neuronal number in the\nmediodorsal nucleus and pulvinar [11]\u2013[16]; and altered\nglutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor\n1045-9227\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In our work, we wanted to generate in vivo ex-\nperiments to explore the relationship between different nuclei\nin the thalamus and schizophrenia. An amino acid currently\nutilized as an indicator of neuronal, axonal, and dendritic\nintegrity is N-acetylaspartate (NAA), the levels of which can be\ndetected by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS)\n(a useful tool for the in vivo quantification of brain metabo-\nlites). NAA\u2019s exact biological function has not been precisely\nelucidated. Evidence suggests that it is involved in the transport\nof water out of neurons [19] and may also be important in\nforming the myelin sheath around axons [20]. NAA concentra-\ntions have been shown to diminish with axonal loss, and there\nis evidence linking NAA to compromised functional and\/or\nstructural neuronal integrity of the (large number of) neurons\nin a voxel in a wide range of disorders [21], [22]. Combining\n1H MRS and measures of cognitive ability has highlighted\nthe relationship of NAA to neuropsychological functioning in\nnormal human brains. For example, Jung et al. [23], [24] have\nreported a correlation between occipitoparietal white matter\nNAA levels and IQ in young adults. NAA concentrations in\nthe thalamus may also reveal key neuroanatomical alterations\nin schizophrenia. Recent studies comparing schizophrenics\nwith controls have noted: 1) reduced thalamic NAA levels in\nschizophrenia [26]\u2013[28]; and 2) no group differences in NAA\nlevels [29]\u2013[31]. Discrepancies are thought to be due to several\nfactors such as varying voxel size, position, and slice thickness;\naveraging many voxels over a large region; and voxel tissue het-\nerogeneity. Studies with more localized voxel placement have\ndetected reduced bilateral mediodorsal and anterior thalamic\nNAA levels in schizophrenia [26]\u2013[28]. However, these studies\ndid not examine additional thalamic subregions. In this study,\nwe examined schizophrenia-related subregional thalamic NAA\nabnormalities using neural network techniques. This involved\ntraining multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) using NAA values\nrecorded from different areas of the thalamus as inputs and the\nclassification of schizophrenic versus control as a target output.\nB. Inferring the Importance of Input Features\nUsing Neural Networks\nNeural networks are no longer \u201cblack boxes\u201d; techniques\nexist to extract knowledge that they have learned when modeling\nthe task they have been applied to (for example, rules\/decision\ntrees can be extracted\u2014see [32]). However, in this research,\nwe were not interested in extracting knowledge in the form\nof rules\/decision trees, but in locating areas of the thalamus\nimplicated in schizophrenia by inferring the importance of\ninput features from the spectroscopic data. Inferring the relative\nimportance of features has received a great deal of attention in\nthe machine learning and statistics research communities [33].\nA successful Bayesian method for assessing the importance of\nfeatures is automatic relevance determination (ARD), which\ncan be applied to standard feedforward neural networks [34],\n[35] and has many applications [36], [37]. This approach\noptimizes the model evidence (marginal likelihood), the classic\ncriterion for Bayesian modeling, and generates hyperparame-\nters , explicitly representing the relevance of different input\nfeatures. A separate hyperparameter is associated with each\ninput variable of an MLP. Each of these represents the\ninverse variance of the distribution of the weights fanning out\nfrom a particular input. During training, these hyperparameters\nare modified. The initial prior distribution of the weights\nis assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with zero mean\nwhich is in the form\n(1)\nwhere are the weights fanning out from the input\nis the normalization constant, and is the hyperparameter of\nweights . As training of the MLP progresses, every hyperpa-\nrameter is reestimated to a new value using [34]\n(2)\nwhere is the posterior mean of the weights corresponding to\nan input and is a measure of how \u201cwell determined\u201d\nits corresponding parameter is by the data [34]. The quan-\ntity is calculated from the eigenvalues of the matrix of\nweights and biases in the network using\n(3)\nThe quantity effectively captures the influence of the likeli-\nhood and the prior (i.e., when is small and fits the\ndata; when is large and is highly constrained by\nthe prior). An excellent explanation of this procedure is avail-\nable [38] and a useful software implementation and associated\ntextbook can be found [39], [40]. On completion of training, a\nsmall means that the corresponding input (e.g., area of the\nthalamus) is important in schizophrenia. Conversely, large\nindicate that the regions of the thalamus associated with that\ninput are not important in schizophrenia.\nII. METHOD\nAll 18 subjects were male (in order to remove confounding\neffects from differences between male and female brains).\nAll nine schizophrenic subjects met the Diagnostic and Sta-\ntistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for\nschizophrenia, and had no history of head injury, organic\nmental disorder, neurological disorder, cerebrovascular disease,\nmajor mood disorder, or anxiety disorder. They were also free\nof any clinically significant alcohol\/substance abuse in the 12\nmonths prior to the study. The nine control subjects had no\nhistory of substantial medical illness, head injury, neurological\nor psychiatric disorder, or clinically significant alcohol\/sub-\nstance abuse. There was no significant difference between\npatients and controls in age, and all subjects were right-handed.\nAll MRI\/MRS studies were performed on a 1.5-T Magnetom\nVISION system using a standard circularly polarized head coil.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The MRI scans of both groups were\nexamined by a neuroradiologist and determined to be free of\nabnormalities. Multislice 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic\nimaging (MRSI) (TR\/TE 1960\/135 ms) was performed using\nthree axially oblique 15-mm-thick sections oriented to the\nDSE angle, with the middle slice centered on the thalamus.\nThe nominal voxel size was 0.9 mL, and the effective voxel\nsize (after reconstruction of MRSI data volumes) was 1.5 mL.\nEach subject was assigned a numerical code for blind measure-\nment and data processing. The MRI tissue segmentation and\nvolumetric techniques described in [41] were used to segment\nthe brain into cortical and subcortical gray matter, sulcal and\nventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter, and white\nmatter signal hyperintensities. The boundaries of the thalamus\nwere manually delineated on each DSE axial slice containing\nvisible thalamus to create thalamic tissue volume masks.\nIn-house software was then used to coregister the segmentation\nand thalamic volume information with the MRSI data, to obtain\nthe tissue composition of each MRSI voxel so that the NAA\nconcentrations could be tissue corrected.\nThe data set containing the NAA values initially proved\nproblematic for training an MLP, for a number of reasons.\nThe number of voxels containing thalamic tissue (containing\nvarying amounts of thalamic tissue from 1% to 100%) for\neach subject varied (from 80 to 100 voxels between subjects),\nand the potential number of input parameters would cause\ntremendous overfitting problems for a neural network (together\nwith extended training times). In addition, there was little\ncorrespondence of the and coordinates of voxels between\nsubjects, because different subjects\u2019 brains have different sizes\nand shapes, and brain positioning within the scanner varies\nbetween subjects. To counter these problems, the and\ncoordinates were scaled to total and ranges per subject,\nand suitable and quantization values were chosen so that\nvoxel NAA concentrations could be compared across subjects,\ntaking into account the percentage of thalamic tissue in each\nvoxel. The result of this was a set of 20 mean thalamic NAA\nconcentration values for each subject, distributed across a 2-D\ngrid representing an \u201caverage\u201d thalamus (scaled across all\nsubjects). Using these 20 NAA concentrations as inputs and the\nclasses 1 schizophrenic and 0 control as target outputs,\nMLPs were constructed and then trained using the scaled\nconjugate gradients algorithm [42] and Bayesian weight regu-\nlarization [34], [35] to prevent overfitting. Once the networks\nwere trained, ARD parameters were generated for each input.\nThe classification performance of the MLPs was evaluated\nusing leave-one-out cross validation. A range of hidden unit\nvalues from one to 20 was evaluated, with 100 MLPs being\ntrained for each hidden unit setting using different random\ninitial weights and weight ranges for each (to compensate for\nTABLE I\nLEAVE-ONE-OUT CROSS-VALIDATION PERFORMANCE OF THE MLP\nAND STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES\nspurious results being caused by the small number of items in\nthe training set). For each model trained, records were made of\nclassification performance and values generated by the ARD\nalgorithm, and classification performance\/ARD values were\naveraged over all 100 runs of each model. As a comparison,\nthe MLPs performance was compared with that of two stan-\ndard statistical techniques (multiple step linear regression and\nlogistic regression, both using leave-one-out cross validation).\nIII. RESULTS\nAn MLP with a minimum of six hidden units, using the NAA\nvalues as input, could reliably differentiate schizophrenic sub-\njects from controls for all subjects (18\/18 100% accuracy).\nAs a comparison, the two standard statistical techniques could\nperform the same task with reduced accuracy (see Table I). This\nimplied that the MLP was producing a more accurate model of\nthe data than the other two techniques, and should be the model\nselected when attempting to understand the influence of partic-\nular input features (i.e., NAA level in a particular area of the\nthalamus) and the schizophrenic disease state.\nA schematic diagram of the thalamus, with most of the nu-\nclei unlabeled and only those associated with interesting re-\nsults in this study, is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows a contour\ngraph of ARD values for the grid of coordinates across the\nthalamus. Here, light colors show areas where ARD has iden-\ntified regions of importance for differentiating schizophrenics\nfrom controls, whereas dark areas indicate regions unimpor-\ntant for discriminating these groups. Figs. 2 and 3 are super-\nimposed in Fig. 4, which shows that ARD has highlighted the\nright mediodorsal nucleus and pulvinar of the thalamus as being\nimportant in schizophrenia. In addition, there is a lighter patch\non the top right of this figure, corresponding to the left anterior\nthalamus. After inspecting of many of these regions of the thal-\namus, schizophrenic subjects have markedly lower NAA con-\ncentrations than controls. However, it is not possible to separate\nthe schizophrenic and control groups by simply inspecting NAA\nvalues at specific coordinates.\nIV. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION\nUsing a nonlinear neural network such as the Bayesian MLP\nfor modeling a psychiatric data set provides enhanced classifi-\ncation performance when compared to two standard statistical\ntechniques. However, the current model used a small number of\ninputs, and there are questions on the scalability of this Bayesian\nMLP-based technique to a data set containing many more input\nvoxels (particularly in terms of extended training times and gen-\neralization ability when there are a large number of voxels per\nsubject, but few subjects).

Contour graph of ARD results for thalamus. Light shading includes low\n(important) ARD values.\nhaving 40-K voxels as inputs [43] has demonstrated that sup-\nport vector machines (SVMs) [44] and cross validation can be\nused in these circumstances. In addition, other work has shown\nthat ARD can be performed on SVMs [45], [46]. An alternative\ntechnique is to use Bayesian MLPs on a subset of the available\nvoxels that has been selected empirically using logistic regres-\nsion [47].\nTraining neural networks with ARD has highlighted partic-\nular areas of the thalamus, such as the right mediodorsal and\npulvinar nuclei (with lesser involvement of the left anterior\nnucleus) as being important in schizophrenia. These findings\nsupport previous research indicating structural and functional\nalterations in these areas of the thalamus in schizophrenia.\nFor example, functional neuroimaging studies have found\nFig. 4. Superimposition of contours from Fig. 2 and diagram of thalamus from\nFig. 3, indicating mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and pulvinar (PV).\ndifferences in glucose metabolism or BOLD activation in the\nmediodorsal, anterior, and pulvinar regions of the thalamus\nin patients with schizophrenia [6]\u2013[9]. Other studies have\nreported schizophrenia-related reductions in volume and\/or\nneuronal number in the thalamic nuclei highlighted by our\ntechniques [11]\u2013[16]. Altered glutamatergic NMDA receptor\nexpression [17] and synaptic dysfunction or loss [18] have also\nbeen detected in the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei\nin patients with schizophrenia. Most importantly, our find-\nings support and extend the results of previous spectroscopic\ninvestigations with voxels localized to the mediodorsal and\nanterior regions of the thalamus [26]\u2013[28]. Those studies also\nfound NAA deficits in patients with schizophrenia, but did not\nexamine the pulvinar region.\nAlthough the mediodorsal nucleus and pulvinar receive\na wide range of inputs from other brain structures (limbic\nstructures, basal ganglia, and brain stem nuclei), of particular\ninterest when focusing on schizophrenia are the reciprocal\nconnections of the thalamus with areas of cortex. All thalamic\nrelays receive feedback from layer 6 of cortex. As well as\nreceiving this feedback from cortex, \u201cfirst-order relays\u201d are\nthose which send information to cortical areas about events\nhappening in subcortical areas of the brain. In addition to\nreceiving information from layer 6 of cortex, \u201chigher order\nrelays\u201d receive additional input from layer 5 of cortex. In this\nway, higher order relays relay information already in cortex via\ndriver input from layer 5 of one cortical area to middle areas of\nanother cortical area [48]. The mediodorsal nucleus has the vast\nmajority of its reciprocal higher order cortical connections with\nthe prefrontal cortex [49], a part of the brain heavily involved\nin declarative memory. The highlighting of the mediodorsal\nnucleus by our ARD results is interesting when compared to the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The pulvinar may have a specific role in\ndirecting attention to stimuli in the visual field [51], and has been\ndemonstrated to play a key role in pattern-motion selectivity and\ncomplex motion integration [52]. The highlighting of the pulv-\ninar by our ARD results is interesting when compared to the ev-\nidence that schizophrenic subjects show deficits in such visual\nprocessing tasks [53]. The wider significance of our findings of\nreduced NAA in these areas of the thalamus is that they con-\ntribute to a growing body of work suggesting aberrant thalamic\npathways in schizophrenia. By extending our analysis to include\nthose brain regions connected to the pulvinar, and mediodorsal\nnucleus, we hope to gain further insight into this deficient tha-\nlamic circuitry.\nMany diverse computational models of schizophrenia have\nbeen created, varying widely on the symptoms of schizophrenia\nmodeled, the pathological factors assumed to cause the illness\nand the biological realism of the architecture of the computa-\ntional model itself. Many models of schizophrenia have been\nproposed [54], [55] covering the effects of neuromodulators\n[56]. Some researchers have built computational models of\nthe thalamus, cortex, or hippocampus, and investigated their\nabilities to model psychiatric disease. For example, Pelaez [57]\ninvestigated pattern completion in a neural network model of\nthe thalamus and a biologically plausible model of synaptic\nplasticity in relation to schizophrenia, and it was proposed that\nthe hallucinations observed were the result of aberrant pattern\ncompletion dynamics in thalamic areas. Work investigating\nthe thalamus using a network of integrate-and-fire neurons to\nmodel analogical processing [58] suggests that the thalamic\nreticular nucleus may play a key role. Many cortical models\nof schizophrenia have used attractor-based models such as\nHopfield [59] networks to generate models of dysfunction\n(where the central argument is that in schizophrenia too many,\ntoo few, or too strong attractors exist [60]\u2013[74] Many other\nresearchers have produced both evidence and models high-\nlighting the importance of cortical dopaminergic mechanisms\nin schizophrenia [75]\u2013[79] whereas related work [80] suggests\nthat hyperconnectivity within a given cortical circuit leads to\nsome of the manifestations of schizophrenia. Other models\nassume disruption of the dynamic connectivity between brain\nregions [81]\u2013[85]. Various findings have emphasized hip-\npocampal dysfunction [86]\u2013[93]. There are many approaches\nto modeling schizophrenia described previously (for more\nin-depth reviews of these models, see [94] and [95]), while a\nhost of other models are described in [96]\u2013[100]. However,\nsome current themes run through the majority of models.\n\u2022 Autonomous output patterns that are pathological are\nformed by hyperassociation between memory circuits.\n\u2022 The functional disconnection between different brain areas\nthat are normally integrated is important (often hypoth-\nesized as decreased communication between frontal\u2013hip-\npocampal and\/or cortical circuits).\nHowever, although some of the aforementioned models\nattempt to take some inspiration from the gross structure of\nspecific brain regions use biologically inspired learning rules\n(Hebbian-inspired rather than biologically unrealistic learning\nmethods such as backpropagation) and attempt to relate to\nresults generated by fMRI studies, none of the current models\nderive from neuroanatomically or neurochemically realistic\ndata, such as that generated by recent studies using fMRI\/MRSI\nand other analysis techniques. The models described previously\nhave generated useful hypotheses about brain differences,\nand have been validated against behavioral data, but have not\nbeen tested using actual neurophysical data generated from\nschizophrenics and controls. Taking inspiration from these\nmodels, and the established connection between NAA and\ncognition, we intend to build a computational neuroscience\nmodel investigating the role of the thalamic structures outlined\nin the aforementioned research, and study its ability to replicate\nfacets of the schizophrenic disease state. The model will test\nthe effects of damage to the specific nuclei of the thalamus\noutlined in this paper, striatal hyper and frontal hypodopamine\ntransmission, and NMDA receptor antagonism, with specific\nattention being paid to both first- and higher order relays and\nthe thalamacortical loop. Such a model will be used to comment\non the validity of previous approaches to cognitive modeling\n(encompassing models of both normal and abnormal cognition)\nand suggest new avenues for exploration in computational\nneuroscience.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
