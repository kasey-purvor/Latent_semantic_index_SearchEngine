The presence of L. perenne 24 \nincreased the proportion of ozone-injured leaves in T. repens, whilst the presence of T. 25 \nrepens decreased the proportion of senesced leaves in L. perenne.  In L. perenne, the 26 \nproportion of injured leaves at the edge and inner canopy decreased significantly when 27 \ngrown in competition, whilst for T. repens the reverse effect occurred in the inner 28 \ncanopy only.  29 \n It is proposed that different mechanisms influence the interaction between response to 30 \nozone and competitors in these species:  the response of Lolium perenne to ozone may 31 \nhave been related to nitrogen supply, whilst in Trifolium repens canopy structure was 32 \nmore important. 33 \n 34 \nKey words 35 \nOzone; visible injury; senescence; stomatal conductance; canopy; competition 36 \n 37 \nIntroduction 38 \nAmbient ozone concentrations in Europe have been shown to cause significant effects on a 39 \nwide range of plant species.  Although the effects vary between species, visible leaf injury and 40 \npremature senescence are frequently reported from ozone exposure studies (e.g. Bergmann et 41 \nal., 1999; Novak et al., 2003).  In addition, approximately 80 species of semi-natural vegetation 42 \nhave been recorded with symptoms attributed to ozone in ambient air conditions (Hayes et al., 43 \n2007).  There is a need to improve predications of the impacts of ambient ozone on natural 44 \nvegetation communities, however, many studies investigate the effects of ozone using single 45 \nspecies, and the presence of competing species in a community may affect the response to 46 \n  \n3 \nozone.  Canopy structure and competition are two interlinked factors to be considered as 47 \ninfluences on the response to ozone in mixed vegetation communities.  To our knowledge, no 48 \nother studies have investigated both of these factors together.   49 \n 50 \nFor some species, the magnitude of the response to ozone has been shown to be influenced by 51 \ncompetition, for example, the grass Elymus glaucus increased the impact of ozone exposure on 52 \nPinus ponderosa (Anderson et al., 2001).  Similarly Poa pratensis has been demonstrated to be 53 \nmore sensitive to ozone (in terms of visible injury) when grown in competition with Veronica 54 \nchamaedrys compared to when grown as a monoculture but not when grown with other species 55 \nsuch as Achillea millefolium (Bender et al., 2005).  In contrast, Holcus lanatus, Lychnis flos-56 \ncuculi, Molinia caerulea and Plantago lanceolata showed no difference in response to ozone 57 \nwhen grown in monoculture compared to when grown in competition with Agrostis capillaris 58 \n(Tonneijck et al., 2004).   59 \n 60 \nPresence within a canopy of vegetation may also influence the response of an individual 61 \nspecies to ozone.  Few studies have investigated the changing profiles of ozone and light 62 \nthrough plant canopies, and these existing studies have tended to involve large canopies such 63 \nas forests (e.g. Utiyama et al., 2004).  Lantinga et al. (1999) showed that PAR was dramatically 64 \nreduced inside a plant canopy, and in stands of a monoculture of cut-leaved coneflower 65 \n(Rudbeckia laciniata L.), ozone concentrations 20 cm above the ground were only half the 66 \nconcentration of those just above the top of the canopy, which was approximately 1.5 \u2013 2.0 67 \nmetres high (Finkelstein et al., 2004).  Within these large stands of cut-leaved coneflower, the 68 \nextent of ozone injury was lower on plants growing within the stand compared to those on the 69 \nedge (Chappelka et al., 2003).  A similar pattern of ozone concentration within the canopy 70 \noccurred in the only study to investigate profiles of a grassland canopy, where leaves of low 71 \n  \n4 \ngrowing Trifolium repens received approximately 30% less ozone than Alopecurus pratensis, 72 \nwhich itself was exposed to slightly lower ozone concentrations than those of the bulk air 73 \nabove the canopy (J\u00e4ggi et al., 2006).  Thus, there is the potential for differential effects of 74 \nozone within mixed canopy grasslands.   75 \n 76 \nModels of ozone fluxes to natural vegetation communities have been developed (e.g. Bassin et 77 \nal., 2004, Emberson et al., 2000, 2001, Simpson et al., 2003).  These models currently include 78 \nthe influence of environmental variables such as temperature on stomatal conductance and 79 \ntherefore ozone fluxes.  Use of a mechanistic model of canopy development of Lolium perenne 80 \ndemonstrated the importance of simulation of canopy growth compared to a fixed seasonal 81 \nprofile of leaf area index (Ashmore et al., 2007), however these models do not currently 82 \naccount for differential ozone uptake within different portions of a plant canopy, or differential 83 \nuptake by different species or functional types. 84 \n 85 \nIn this study, responses of plants grown in monoculture were compared to the responses when 86 \ngrown in mixture, using Trifolium repens and Lolium perenne as model species that respond to 87 \nozone by the development of ozone injury and senescence.  Detailed measurements of visible 88 \ninjury and senescence were carried out at different positions in the canopy to investigate 89 \nwhether the presence of a competitor modifies the extent and location of damage within the 90 \ncanopy.   Effects in Trifolium repens were related to within canopy variation in stomatal 91 \nconductance.   92 \n 93 \n  \n5 \nMaterials and Methods 94 \nPlant material 95 \nPlant material was vegetatively propagated from Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens plants 96 \nfrom turf samples of pasture managed for silage near Edinburgh, UK (Grid reference 97 \nNT245642).  Plants originating from different parents were randomised between different 98 \ncompetition and ozone treatments.  Individual plants were established for approximately eight 99 \nweeks before monocultures and mixtures of plants were established for ozone exposure.   100 \nExperimental design 101 \nLarge containers (35.5 cm x 45 cm x 25 cm deep), with holes for drainage, were lined with 102 \nperforated plastic sheeting to prevent roots from growing out through the bottom and filled 103 \nwith multipurpose compost (\u201eGem\u201f tub and planter). 104 \n 105 \nIn each pot twelve plants were planted in an evenly spaced arrangement, consisting of four 106 \ncentral plants surrounded by eight additional plants.  In each mixture, the four central plants 107 \nwere Trifolium repens and the eight surrounding plants were Lolium perenne.  Three pots each 108 \nof the Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens monocultures, and three pots of the Lolium 109 \nperenne and Trifolium repens mixture were randomly allocated to each of four solardomes.  110 \nPlants were exposed in the solardomes for twelve weeks, starting on 26\nth\n July 2002.  The 111 \nexposure period was divided into two harvest periods.  Plants were cut back on 6\nth\n September, 112 \nthe intermediate harvest, and 16\nth\n October, when the final harvest occurred.  Plants were kept 113 \nwell-watered throughout the experiment using a mist irrigation system, with additional 114 \nwatering by hand during periods of warm weather. 115 \n 116 \n  \n6 \nOzone exposure 117 \nFour solardomes were used for exposure.  Ozone was generated from oxygen using an ozone 118 \ngenerator (Wallace and Tiernan).  Ozone concentrations were measured every 30 minutes in 119 \neach solardome using an ozone analyser (Dasibi 1003-AH) which sampled ozone for a 120 \nminimum of 3.5 minutes from each solardome using a computer controlled sample selector.  121 \nTwo solardomes were used as controls, with ozone added to charcoal-filtered air using 122 \ncomputer controlled (LabView version 6) mass flow controllers to give continuous ozone 123 \nconcentrations in each dome of 30 ppb (O3(30)).  An episodic rural ozone profile 124 \n(O3(30+peaks)) was given over the course of each week to the two other domes.  The ozone 125 \nexposure was programmed to reach a maximum concentration of 80 ppb on days 1 and 4, and a 126 \nmaximum concentration of 100 ppb on days two and three.  Ozone concentrations increased 127 \nfrom 30 ppb to the daily maximum over the course of 2 hours, remained at the daily maximum 128 \nfor 6 hours, then decreased back down to 30 ppb over the course of 2 hours.  Ozone 129 \nconcentrations were programmed to remain at 30 ppb at all other times.   130 \n 131 \nVisual assessments 132 \nVisual estimates of senescence and ozone-specific injury, apparent as white or pale yellow 133 \nstipples on the leaf surface, were made for whole pots, because the individual plants had grown 134 \ntogether and could not be separated.  Leaves were classified as either senesced or injured if 135 \n>25% of the leaf was senesced or injured respectively, otherwise they were classified as 136 \nhealthy.  For Lolium perenne senescence of leaves started at the leaf tip and progressed along 137 \nthe leaf blade.  The length of the senesced portion (in mm) of the leaf blade was measured on a 138 \nsub-sample of twenty randomly chosen leaves in each pot. 139 \n  \n7 \nHarvests 140 \nAll plants were cut back to a height of 7 cm on 6\nth\n September and 16\nth\n October, after exposure 141 \nto the ozone regime for six weeks and 12 weeks respectively.  The plants were harvested in 142 \nseparate layers: material growing outside the pot perimeter, material greater than 14 cm above 143 \nsoil level, and plant material between 7 cm and 14 cm above soil level.  At the final harvest an 144 \nadditional layer with plant material 0 to 7 cm above soil level was also used.  Fresh plant 145 \nmaterial from each layer was sorted into the component species at the time of harvest.  Healthy 146 \nand ozone-injured leaves of Trifolium repens were separated.  Lolium perenne was sorted into 147 \nhealthy leaves and senesced leaves.  Plant material was dried at 65 C for a minimum of 4 days 148 \nbefore biomass was determined. 149 \nStomatal conductance measurements 150 \nMeasurements of stomatal conductance were made on Trifolium repens using a porometer 151 \n(Delta-T AP4) on days of stable meteorological conditions after exposure to the ozone regime 152 \nfor 10\/11 weeks.  Measurements of stomatal conductance in the upper canopy (where leaves 153 \nwere in full sunlight) and the inner canopy (where leaves were more shaded) were taken, using 154 \nsix leaves (two per pot) for each canopy position in every solardome.   155 \nChlorophyll content 156 \nChlorophyll content (chlorophyll a + b) of leaves of Trifolium repens was measured using a 157 \nSPAD meter (CCM-200, ADC Bioscientific Ltd., UK) after exposure to the ozone treatment 158 \nfor one week and ten weeks.  \u201eTypical\u201f leaves were used; therefore some ozone injury was 159 \npresent in some cases.  The chlorophyll index, in relative units, given by the SPAD meter, were 160 \ncalibrated for Trifolium repens following determination of chlorophyll content by extraction 161 \nwith acetone and measurement of light absorption at wavelengths 470, 646 and 663 nm, 162 \naccording to the equations of Lichtenthaler and Wellburn (1983).  The relationship between 163 \n  \n8 \nchlorophyll index and measured chlorophyll (mg g\n-1\n fresh weight) had an r\n2\n of 0.90 (data not 164 \npresented) and was: 165 \n 166 \nChlorophyll content (mg g\n-1\n FW) = (chlorophyll index * 30.448) + 417 167 \n  168 \nStatistical analysis 169 \nFor each parameter, values were averaged to provide a mean per solardome prior to subsequent 170 \nanalysis.  Statistical analysis was based on these dome means.  Visible injury and senescence 171 \ndata were arcsine transformed prior to analysis.  Oneway ANOVA (Minitab version 14) was 172 \nused for analysis of stomatal conductance data.  Other comparisons were made in Genstat 173 \n(version 8) using split-plot or split-split plot ANOVA.  The main plot was ozone treatment and 174 \nthe sub-plots were monoculture\/mixture.  Sub-sub-plots of canopy position were used where 175 \nappropriate.  176 \nResults 177 \nOzone concentrations 178 \nThe mean AOT40 for the two domes exposed to the O3(30+peaks) episodic ozone regime was 179 \n9.98 ppm.h during the first harvest interval, and 11.89 ppm.h during the second harvest 180 \ninterval, giving a total of 21.86 ppm.h over the 12 week exposure period (Table 1).  The 181 \ndifference in AOT40 between the two replicate O3(30+peaks) solardomes was less than 2% for 182 \neach harvest interval.  In the two replicate O3(30) solardomes, the mean AOT40 over the 183 \nexposure period was less than 0.02 ppm.h.  24-hour mean, 12-hour mean and 12-hour mean of 184 \nepisode days also show small differences between the replicate solardomes (Table 1). 185 \n 186 \n  \n9 \nInfluence of Lolium perenne on visible injury on clover 187 \nVisible injury caused by ozone on Trifolium repens was apparent first as small, yellow flecks 188 \non the leaves.  As the severity increased, the extent of chlorosis increased until eventually the 189 \nleaf was dry and curled.  Visible injury symptoms caused by ozone were first observed on the 190 \nclover plants after one week of exposure.  Very little non-specific senescence (<1 % of leaves) 191 \nwas observed on T. repens leaves during the experiment; any senescence that corresponded 192 \nwith the presence of ozone injury symptoms was recorded as \u201cvisible injury\u201d.   193 \n 194 \nAt the intermediate harvest, a visual assessment of the O3(30+peaks) treated Trifolium repens 195 \nplants growing in monoculture showed that 69% of leaves per pot had visible injury symptoms 196 \ncompared to only 0.5% in the O3(30) treatment (p<0.001).  Similar proportions of injury were 197 \nobserved when Trifolium repens was grown in combination with Lolium perenne  - 67% 198 \ninjured leaves in O3(30+peaks) compared to 0% injured in O3(30) (p<0.001).  At the final 199 \nharvest the proportion of injured Trifolium repens leaves per pot in the O3(30+peaks) treatment 200 \nwas significantly higher when grown in the mixture compared to when grown in monoculture 201 \n(77% compared to 67%, p<0.01).  There was also an interaction between ozone treatment and 202 \nwhether the plants were grown in monoculture or in mixture (p<0.01), with a larger difference 203 \nin the extent of visible injury between O3(30) and O3(30+peaks) if the plants were grown in 204 \nmixture with Lolium perenne.   205 \n 206 \nThe proportion of injured leaves was also quantified by biomass.  Separation of leaves into 207 \nthose that were healthy and those that were injured at the intermediate harvest showed that 208 \ndifferences in the biomasses of both healthy leaves and ozone injured leaves were significantly 209 \naffected by ozone in Trifolium repens growing both as a monoculture and as part of the 210 \nmixture (Table 2).  The biomass of injured leaves was approximately two thirds of the total leaf 211 \n  \n10 \nbiomass in O3(30+peaks) treated plants, whereas the biomass of injured leaves was negligible 212 \nin O3(30) plants.  At the final harvest the total leaf biomass and the biomass of both healthy 213 \nand injured leaves were significantly affected by ozone in Trifolium repens growing both as a 214 \nmonoculture and as part of the mixture (Table 2).  The proportion of injured leaves was 215 \nnegligible in O3(30) treated plants and approximately 80% of the total leaf biomass in 216 \nO3(30+peaks) treated plants (Table 2).  Due to the difference in the number of Trifolium repens 217 \nplants per pot in the monoculture and mixture, statistical comparison was based on the 218 \nproportion of injured leaves relative to healthy leaves, rather than the actual biomass.  This 219 \nshowed that there was no significant interaction between ozone treatment and whether the 220 \nplants were grown in monoculture or in mixture.   221 \n 222 \nThe proportion of injured leaves was different in the different regions of the canopy (Figure 1).  223 \nAt the intermediate harvest the highest proportion of injured leaves was in the plant material 224 \ngrowing at the edge of the canopy \u2013 plant material growing outside the pot perimeter (75% of 225 \nleaves were injured, p<0.05).  The proportion of injured leaves was lower above 14cm \u2013 the 226 \nupper canopy (67%) and lowest in the inner canopy (52%) \u2013 plant material between 7cm and 227 \n14cm.  The pattern was similar in the monoculture, and there were no significant effects of 228 \nwhether the plants were grown in monoculture or in mixture, or any significant interaction 229 \nbetween this and the ozone treatment. 230 \n 231 \nAt the final harvest the proportion of injured leaves in the monoculture was not significantly 232 \ndifferent in the different regions of the canopy.  There was much less growth outside of the pot 233 \nperimeter during the second harvest interval (data not presented).  In addition, although there 234 \nwas reduced leaf biomass at the final harvest compared to the intermediate harvest (Table 2), 235 \n  \n11 \nthe canopy height was the same (data not presented) indicating that the canopy was much more 236 \nopen during the second harvest interval.   237 \n 238 \nThe proportion of injured leaves in the inner canopy (7 \u2013 14cm) was higher in plants growing 239 \nin mixture with Lolium perenne compared to those of the monoculture, where the proportions 240 \nof injured leaves were 81% and 63% in the mixture and monoculture respectively at the final 241 \nharvest (Figure 1, p<0.01).  There was also an interaction between ozone exposure and whether 242 \nthe plants were grown in monoculture or in mixture for the proportion of injured leaves in the 243 \ninner canopy (p<0.05), with ozone treatment corresponding with an increased proportion of 244 \ninjured leaves in the mixture.  There were no significant differences and no interaction between 245 \nozone exposure and whether plants were grown in monoculture or in mixture for the proportion 246 \nof injured leaves in the upper canopy or the canopy edge. 247 \nThe influence of Trifolium repens on senescence of Lolium perenne 248 \nIn contrast to T.repens, L. perenne responded to ozone by the development of non-specific 249 \nsenescence; no ozone-specific injury was observed during the course of the experiment.  250 \n 251 \nThe large difference in the extent of senescence of O3(30+peaks) treated Lolium perenne 252 \ncompared to O3(30) was significant at both harvests (Table 3, p<0.05 at each harvest).  In the 253 \nO3(30+peaks) treatment at the intermediate harvest, the proportion of senesced leaves was 254 \napproximately 50% for plants growing in the monoculture and in the mixture.  At the final 255 \nharvest, there was a further increase in senescence of plants in the O3(30+peaks) treatment in 256 \nthe monoculture, to 68%, but a reduction in senescence for plants in mixture with Trifolium 257 \nrepens to 28%.  There was also significantly less senescence of Lolium perenne when grown as 258 \na mixture compared to as a monoculture in the O3(30) treatment (0% vs 28%, p<0.001).  259 \n  \n12 \nHowever, there was no significant interaction between ozone treatment and whether the plants 260 \nwere grown in monoculture or in mixture at either harvest. 261 \n 262 \nIn Lolium perenne plants, senescence started at the tip of the leaf blade and progressed back 263 \ntowards the main plant.  The extent of the senesced portion of leaf (in mm) was significantly 264 \nincreased in O3(30+peaks) treated plants compared to O3(30) plants for both the monoculture 265 \nand the mixture at both harvests (Table 3, p<0.05).  As with the proportion of senesced leaves, 266 \nthe extent of senescence of both O3(30+peaks) and O3(30) treated plants was significantly less 267 \nin the mixture compared to the monoculture at both harvests (p < 0.001 in each case).  Again, 268 \nthere was no significant interaction between ozone treatment and whether the plants were 269 \ngrown in monoculture or in mixture at either harvest. 270 \n 271 \nThe biomass of healthy leaves and senesced leaves were not affected by ozone at the 272 \nintermediate harvest (Table 4), and there was no significant difference in the proportion of 273 \nsenesced leaves of plants grown in monoculture compared to those grown in mixture.  The 274 \nsenesced biomass was approximately four-times greater in the O3(30+peaks) treatment in the 275 \nmonoculture (p<0.01) and approximately two-times greater in the mixture (p<0.1, Table 4).  276 \nThere was no significant interaction between ozone treatment and whether the plants were 277 \ngrown in monoculture or in mixture.   278 \n 279 \nAt the final harvest there was a significant effect of ozone on the biomass of the senesced 280 \nleaves (p<0.01, Table 4).  There was also a large reduction (80%) in the biomass of healthy 281 \nleaves in the O3(30+peaks) treatment of the monoculture (p<0.05), whereas the biomass of 282 \nhealthy leaves in the mixture was not significantly affected by ozone treatment (Table 4). 283 \n 284 \n  \n13 \nThere was a significant effect of canopy position on the proportion of senesced leaves of 285 \nLolium perenne (p<0.01 at each harvest; Figure 2).  The proportion of senesced leaves of 286 \nLolium perenne was much lower in the inner canopy than in the upper canopy or canopy edge 287 \nfor plants growing in both the monoculture and the mixture (p<0.01 in both cases).  The 288 \nproportion of senesced leaves of Lolium perenne was also much lower overall in the mixture 289 \nthan in the monoculture, although this difference was only statistically significant at the 290 \nintermediate harvest (p<0.01).  However there was no significant interaction between ozone 291 \ntreatment and whether the plants were grown in monoculture or in mixture. 292 \nWithin-canopy variation in stomatal conductance  293 \nThere were no significant differences in stomatal conductance of Trifolium repens in the 294 \nmonoculture compared to in mixture with Lolium perenne (data not presented).  However, 295 \nthere was reduced stomatal conductance in the inner canopy compared to the upper canopy of 296 \nTrifolium repens monocultures in both O3(30) (p<0.05) and O3(30+peaks) treatments (p<0.05, 297 \nTable 5).  There were also significant differences between the O3(30) and O3(30+peaks) 298 \ntreatments, with increased stomatal conductance in the inner canopy of O3(30+peaks) treated 299 \nplants compared to O3(30) (p<0.05).  There were no significant differences in stomatal 300 \nconductance between treatments in the upper canopy.  301 \n 302 \nCorresponding measurements of PAR, measured at the same time as stomatal conductance 303 \nusing a light sensor on the head of the leaf clip of the porometer, indicated that the PAR was 304 \ndifferent in the different regions of the canopy.  PAR was reduced by 88% and 77% in the 305 \ninner canopy compared to the upper canopy in the O3(30) and O3(30+peaks) treatments 306 \nrespectively (Table 5).  The PAR in the inner canopy was significantly higher for canopies that 307 \nreceived the O3(30+peaks) treatment compared to O3(30), p<0.01, however, there was no 308 \n  \n14 \ndifference in the relationship between PAR and stomatal conductance between the two ozone 309 \ntreatments (data not presented).   310 \n 311 \nStomatal conductance was not related to leaf age.  For Trifolium repens there was no difference 312 \nin stomatal conductance of different age leaves along a stolon (i.e. between Leaf 1 the newest 313 \nfully expanded leaf, Leaf 2 and Leaf 3) in either the O3(30) or O3(30+peaks) treatments (data 314 \nnot presented).   315 \n 316 \nThere were no significant differences between ozone treatments in the stomatal conductance of 317 \nupper canopy leaves of Lolium perenne after exposure for 2, 4 or 10 weeks (data not 318 \npresented).   319 \nWithin-canopy variation in chlorophyll content 320 \nChlorophyll content of upper canopy leaves was reduced by approximately 12% in leaves of 321 \nTrifolium repens that had been exposed to O3 (30+peaks) compared to the O3(30) treatment 322 \n(p<0.05, Figure 3).  However, there were no significant differences between ozone treatments 323 \nfor leaves of the inner canopy. 324 \n 325 \nThere were no differences in the chlorophyll content of leaves of different ages in the O3(30) 326 \ntreatment, however, there was a significant decrease in the chlorophyll content with increasing 327 \nleaf age in the O3(30+peaks) treatment (Figure 4), which corresponded with an increased 328 \nextent of ozone damage in older leaves.  There were no significant differences in chlorophyll 329 \ncontent of plants grown in monoculture compared to plants grown in mixture (data not 330 \npresented). 331 \n  \n15 \nDiscussion 332 \nBy using two model species representing grasses and legumes, this study has revealed that the 333 \npresence of a competitor modifies the extent and canopy distribution of two important 334 \nresponses to ozone: visible injury and senescence.   335 \n 336 \nOverall, a higher proportion of leaves were injured by ozone when T. repens was grown in 337 \ncompetition with L. perenne than when grown in monoculture, with this effect most significant 338 \nin the inner canopy leaves.  Increased sensitivity to ozone when grown in competition has 339 \npreviously been demonstrated on Poa pratensis (Bender et al., 2005), where P.  pratensis 340 \ndeveloped more ozone injury when grown with competing species such as Veronica 341 \nchamaedrys than when grown alone.  In contrast, L.  perenne was not affected as severely by 342 \nozone when growing in combination with T.  repens compared to when growing in 343 \nmonoculture.  Indeed, senescence was reduced in the mixture in both the O3(30) and 344 \nO3(30+peaks) treatments, we speculate that in L. perenne, since nitrogen transfer from clover 345 \nto grass in grass-clover swards has been demonstrated in several studies e.g. Sincik & Acikgoz 346 \n(2007) and Goodman (1988) there is likely to have been an increased availability of nitrogen to 347 \nLolium perenne when it was grown with Trifolium repens.  It has been shown that for some 348 \nspecies, e.g. Trifolium subterraneum, increased nitrogen supply can partially counterbalance 349 \nthe effects of ozone exposure (Sanz et al., 2005).  Some studies have shown that levels and 350 \nactivity of Rubisco were reduced following ozone exposure (Pell et al., 1997).  Increased 351 \nnitrogen availability may have increased turnover of the Rubisco enzyme in L. perenne, 352 \nreducing leaf senescence.   353 \n 354 \nThe reduced chlorophyll content of Trifolium repens, which corresponds with increased visible 355 \ninjury, implies that there is a reduced capacity for photosynthesis following ozone exposure for 356 \n  \n16 \nthis species, which may have contributed to reduced plant growth (Hayes et al., in press).  The 357 \nproportion of leaves showing visible injury symptoms in Trifolium repens varied according to 358 \nthe position of the leaf in the plant canopy, with reduced injury in the inner canopy.  This 359 \ncorresponded with reduced stomatal conductance in the inner canopy compared to the upper 360 \ncanopy.  At the intermediate harvest, the proportion of leaves of Trifolium repens that had 361 \nvisible injury symptoms was lower in the inner canopy than in the upper canopy and the 362 \ncanopy edge.  This pattern was not as pronounced at the final harvest, which may have been 363 \nbecause there was less growth between the intermediate harvest and the final harvest, resulting 364 \nin a more open canopy.  This would allow increased light and ozone penetration into the inner 365 \ncanopy during the second harvest interval, reducing the differences in microclimate between 366 \nthe upper canopy\/canopy edge compared to the inner canopy at the final harvest.   367 \n 368 \nThere was increased overall ozone leaf injury at the final harvest than at the intermediate 369 \nharvest (using the proportion of injured leaves, quantified by biomass), even though the 370 \nAOT40 value during the two harvest intervals was similar.  This could have been due to the 371 \nmore open canopy, allowing greater penetration of ozone and light.  However, this effect was 372 \nalso seen on the upper canopy and canopy edge leaves, so may have been due to a 373 \ncumulative\/carry-over effect of ozone on the plants.  Cumulative effects caused by ozone on 374 \nplant biomass have previously been shown for Trifolium repens (Fumagalli et al., 2003, 375 \nNussbaum et al., 1995).  In these two studies, regrowth in subsequent growth periods was 376 \naffected and the biomass differences were better related to the cumulative ozone than to the 377 \nozone dose from an individual growth period only.  However, these cumulative effects have 378 \nbeen shown only in biomass and not for visible injury on leaves produced in a subsequent 379 \ngrowth period, as in this study.   380 \n  \n17 \nThe structure of the canopy is also important in influencing the impact of the ozone exposure.  381 \nO3(30+peaks) treated Trifolium repens had a more open canopy due to reduced leaf biomass 382 \nand the leaves curling due to ozone injury.  Similarly, reduced leaf-area index of a soybean 383 \n(Glycine max) canopy has been demonstrated due to increased senescence following ozone 384 \nexposure (Dermody et al., 2006).  Differences in leaf-area index have been related to 385 \ndifferences in penetration of PAR through plant canopies (Shulski et al., 2004).  In the current 386 \nstudy the microclimate of the canopy was altered following ozone exposure and light levels of 387 \nthe inner canopy were higher than those from the O3(30) treatment.  Other factors such as 388 \ntemperature and windspeed may also have been affected, but were not measured.  In this study, 389 \nthe difference in stomatal conductance between the upper and inner canopy of Trifolium repens 390 \nwas reduced in the O3(30+peaks) treatment compared to O3(30) and this corresponded to less 391 \ndense leaf growth giving a more open canopy in the O3(30+peaks) treatment.  This would 392 \nreduce the differences in microclimatic conditions between the upper and inner canopy, 393 \nparticularly for light.  Models of stomatal conductance in response to climatic conditions have 394 \nshown a strong influence of light (e.g. Emberson et al., 2000), and in the current study the 395 \ndifferences in stomatal conductance between the upper and inner canopy were attributed to 396 \ndifferences in light conditions rather than alterations in the relationship between stomatal 397 \nconductance and light.  It is also possible that chronic exposure to ozone increased the 398 \nsluggishness of stomata of the inner canopy leaves as found in other studies (Mills et al., in 399 \npress; Paoletti, 2005). 400 \n 401 \nStomatal conductance of Trifolium repens was similar to that of Lolium perenne, indicating 402 \nthat differences in sensitivity to ozone of the two species are not linked to stomatal 403 \nconductance.  There was no evidence that the stomata of Trifolium repens in comparable upper 404 \ncanopy leaves were being closed by ozone treatment, in contrast to the assumptions made by 405 \n  \n18 \nSitch et al. (2007), where models predicted further increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide 406 \nconcentrations due to ozone induced stomatal closure.  However, in this study measurements of 407 \nstomatal conductance were only carried out on 'non-episode days', when the ozone 408 \nconcentration was the same (approximately 30 ppb) in the two treatments.  It is possible that 409 \nplants may respond to high ozone concentrations by closing their stomata during the period of 410 \nexposure only.  411 \n  412 \nThis study has shown that interspecific interactions can modify the response to ozone of both 413 \nT. repens and L. perenne, with the direction of the interaction dependant on the species.  In 414 \naddition, within-canopy variations in the response to ozone occur, with inner canopy leaves 415 \nhaving less response to ozone.  The influence of neighbouring species and the effects these 416 \nspecies have on the canopy and microclimate should be considered in future studies.  There is a 417 \nneed for studies on more complex plant communities to further investigate whether species are 418 \nas sensitive to ozone as predicted from experiments on monocultures and binary mixtures, and 419 \nto further investigate the role of microclimate in influencing the response to ozone. 420 \n 421 \nAcknowledgements 422 \nThis work was funded by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Integrating Fund Initiative. 423 \n 424 \nReferences 425 \n 426 \nAnderson CP, Hogsett WE, Plocher M, Rodecap KD, Lee EH. 2001.
