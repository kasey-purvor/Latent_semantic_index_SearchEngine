INTRODUCTION\nOn six previous occasions, the House of Lords has deliberated on  whether  a  benign  motive  can\nnegate liability for direct discrimination or victimisation. With the JFS  case,  the  Supreme  Court\nhas added a seventh, and despite nine speeches  and  a  five-four  split,  this  case  bring  us  a  step\ncloser to some coherent guidance on the issue. (The six previous case were: R  v  Birmingham  CC\nex p EOC [1989] 1 AC 1156; James v Eastleigh BC [1990] 2 AC 751; Nagarajan v LRT [2000]  1\nAC 501; Chief Constable of West Yorks v Khan [2001] UKHL 48; Shamoon v Chief  Constable  of\nthe RUC [2003] ICR 337; St Helens MBC v Derbyshire [2007] ICR 841.)\nThe case centred on the admissions policy of an Orthodox Jewish school. In addition to the\n\u2018benign motive\u2019 issue, the Supreme Court addressed the meaning  of  racial  group  where  several\nsub-groups are involved. For many of the speeches, the two  issues  were  intertwined.  There  was\nalso some discussion on the dividing line between direct and indirect discrimination.\n2. FACTS AND DECISION\nThe Jewish Free School\u2019s admissions policy gave preference to children  recognised  as  Orthodox\nJewish by the Office of the Chief Rabbi (OCR), which required that the child\u2019s mother  be  Jewish\neither by matrilineal descent or by conversion under the OCR doctrine. M was  refused  admission\nbecause he did not meet these requirements. His Italian (previously Roman Catholic)  mother  was\na Masorti Jew convert, a denomination not recognised by the OCR. His father, E,  brought  claims\nof direct and indirect racial discrimination under the Education provisions of  the  Race  Relations\nAct 1976 (RRA 1976), as \u2018faith  schools\u2019  enjoy  an  exemption  from  religious  discrimination  in\ntheir admissions: Equality Act 2006, s 50. (A right  recognised  by  the  European  Convention  on\nHuman Rights, (1st Protocol)).\n             The  High  Court  rejected  his  claim.  The  Court  of  Appeal  reversed,  holding  that  the\nadmissions policy amounted to direct discrimination. The Supreme Court, by 5-4  majority  (Lady\nHale, Lords Phillips, Kerr, Clarke & Mance) affirmed, although two of the minority (Lords  Hope,\nRodger, Walker, and Brown) found the  policy  indirectly  discriminated,  and  so  a  7-2  majority\nfound  in  favour  of  M.  (The  minority  held  that  there  was  a   prima   facie   case   of   indirect\ndiscrimination, but only Lords Walker and Brown held that the policy was objectively justified.)\n3. ISSUES\nThe principal difficulty in this case is that being Jewish is both a religious and a racial matter. The\nprincipal issues were whether the admissions policy  was  religious  and\/or  racial;  and  even  if  it\nwere facially racial, whether the religious motive behind it rendered the  ground  of  the  treatment\nsolely religious.\n4. RACIAL GROUPS AND ETHNIC ORIGINS\nSection 3 (1), RRA 1976 defines \u2018racial grounds\u2019 to mean  \u2018colour,  race  nationality  or  ethnic  or\nnational origins\u2019. In Mandla v Dowell Lee  [1983]  2  AC  548  (HL),  562,  Lord  Fraser  provided\nguidance on the meaning of \u2018ethnic origins\u2019. It contained two \u2018essential\u2019 and five further \u2018relevant\u2019\ncharacteristics. The essential characteristics were: (1) a long shared history, of which the  group  is\nconscious as distinguishing it from other groups, and the memory of which it keeps alive;  and  (2)\na cultural tradition of its own, including family and  social  customs  and  manners,  often  but  not\nnecessarily  associated  with  religious  observance.  The  \u2018relevant\u2019  characteristics   were:   (1)   a\ncommon geographical origin or descent from a small number of common ancestors; (2) a common\nlanguage, not necessarily peculiar to the group; (3) a common literature peculiar to the  group;  (4)\na common religion differing from that of  neighbouring  groups  or  from  the  general  community\nsurrounding it; (5) being a minority, or being an oppressed or  a  dominant  group  within  a  larger\ncommunity. Lord Fraser noted that this definition could include converts.\nIt is well established that Jews form a racial group by ethnic origins (ibid 563, citing King-\nAnsell v Police [1979] 2 NZLR 531 (NZCA)). The JFS case was argued over the  ethnic  status  of\nJewish sub-groups.\n            The JFS defence rested on identifying two Jewish groups. First, the  OCR  group.  Second,\nthe Mandla group which is all practising Jews, or those recognisable  by  \u2018the  man  in  the  street\u2019.\nThe Mandla ethnic group would exclude some with a matrilineal link to those at Mount  Sinai  but\nwho have long since abandoned the Jewish faith and may  even  be  unaware  of  the  genetic  link.\nThis is because they do not satisfy Lord Fraser\u2019s  two  essential  characteristics.  Of  course,  these\npersons fell within the OCR group. The JFS  argument  ran  that  as  the  OCR  definition  includes\npersons not within the (Mandla) Jewish group, it cannot be based  on  ethnic  origins,  or  race.   It\nmust be solely religious ([30]-[31]).\nLord Phillips accepted the first part of this proposition but rejected its  conclusion,  noting:\n\u2018The fallacy lies in treating current membership of a Mandla ethnic group as the exclusive  ground\nof racial discrimination.\u2019 The requirement for matrilineal descent (cases of conversion to one side)\nwas \u2018racial, and in any event, ethnic\u2019 ([42]). Hence, he concluded ([46]): \u2018Discrimination against a\nperson  on  the  grounds  that  he  or  she  is,  or  is  not,  a   member   of   either   group   is   racial\ndiscrimination.\u2019\n             Lord  Kerr  ([121])  explained  that  although  the  claimant  could  be  defined  as   Jewish\naccording to the Mandla criteria, \u2018belonging to that group is not comprehensive  of  his  ethnicity.\u2019\nThere can be \u2018mixed ethnic origins that do not fall neatly into one group or  category\u2019  and  so  the\nclaimant also could define his ethnic origins as a half-Italian Masorti Jew ([108]-[109]). That  was\nthe ground of discrimination in this case. Similarly, Lord Clarke found that identifying the ground\nof treatment was not an either\/or  question  (either  religion  or  ethnic).  The  definition  of  ethnic\norigins was more flexible. So it was possible to discriminate on both religious and ethnic  grounds\n([127]-[129]).\n             Lord  Mance  suggested  that  the  Orthodox  Judaism  could  be  regarded  as   a   separate\nMandla ethnic group ([86]), but in any  case,  M  was  at  a  disadvantage  because  of  his  descent\n([89]).\nLady Hale ([66]) held that \u2018M was rejected because of his mother\u2019s  ethnic  origins,  which\nwere Italian and Roman Catholic.\u2019\n5. COMMENT ON RACIAL GROUPS\nStripped to its bare bones, the decision means  this:  The  JFS  criteria  included  a  racial  element:\nmatrilineal descent from those at Mount Sinai (\u2018racially  Jewish\u2019).  This  included  those  who  had\nlong since abandoned  the  Jewish  religion,  and  could  even  be  practising  Roman  Catholics  or\natheists.  No  matter  what  other  compensating  elements  were  provided,  this  element   directly\ndiscriminated  on  racial  grounds.  If  the  claimant  were  racially  Jewish,  he  would  have   been\nadmitted. The wider comments call for some consideration.\nA. Sub-Groups and Overlaps\nSection 3(2) of the Act provides: \u2018The fact  that  a  racial  group  comprises  two  or  more  distinct\nracial groups does not prevent it from constituting a particular racial group for the purposes of this\nAct.\u2019 On the face of it, this prevents reducing each racial group  to  its  smallest  possible  number.\nThus, discrimination against \u2018the Spanish\u2019 would be actionable, even though that group comprises\nBasques, Catalans, and so on. It is implicit in section 3(2) that this logic can be inversed. In Ealing\nLBC v Race  Relations  Board  [1972]  AC  342  (HL)  Lord  Simon  suggested  that  within  Great\nBritain, Scots, Welsh  and  English  could  each  be  defined  by  national  origins  (ibid,  363-364,\napplied in Northern Joint Police Board v Power [1997]  IRLR  610  (EAT)).  On  this  basis  \u2018sub-\ngroups\u2019 such as Catalans, Basques, Walloons (Belgiums of French origin), Sicilians,  Bretons  and\nthe Cornish are definable by national or ethnic origins, and discrimination against one of these sub-\ngroups is actionable.\nLord Simon\u2019s example also suggests that sub-groups can still  exist  even  if  they  overlap.\nAfter all, the English, Welsh and Scottish certainly  overlap.  This  should  also  be  the  case  with\nfurther sub-groups, such as the Cornish.  But,  in  the  High  Court,  Munby  J  found  \u2018there  is  no\nevidence ... to suggest that, for example, either Orthodox  Jews  or  Masorti  Jews  (as  opposed  to\nJews generally) have distinct ethnic origins.\u2019 ([2008] EWHC 1535 (Admin) [166]) The  key  word\nhere is \u2018distinct\u2019. It means that to qualify under the Act, a racial group must have no (or very little)\noverlap with any other group. In the Supreme Court,  Lord  Mance  disagreed  ([2009]  UKSC  15,\n[86]): \u2018That may be said to focus purely on ethnic origins in  a  way  which  the  Mandla  test  was\nintended to discourage.\u2019 Presumably, he means  that  the  Mandla  definition  of  ethnic  origins  is\nmore fluid than that. In any case, the majority speeches confirm that a sub-group exists  even  if  it\noverlaps with other sub-groups.\nThe fluidity of identifying sub-groups was illustrated in the  United  States  case  Walker  v\nSecretary of the Treasury 713 F Supp 403 (ND Ga 1989)  and  742  F  Supp  670  (ND  Ga  1990),\nwhere a predominantly dark-skinned black workforce discriminated against a  light-skinned  black\ncolleague. The Federal District Court found that Ms Walker\u2019s  direct  discrimination  claim  based\nsolely on her colour (\u2018light-skinned black\u2019 being a sub-group  of,  and  overlapping  with,  \u2018black\u2019)\ncould succeed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 1964. The Court cited  Felix  v  Marquez  24\nEmpl Prac Dec (CCH) 279 (DDC 1980) [31], where it was  noted  that  colour  may  be  the  \u2018most\npractical\u2019 claim where the victim has mixed heritage.\nB. Same Group Discrimination\nIt follows from this that there can be liability even where  a  racial  group  discriminates  against  a\nperson from the same racial group. This was expressed only by Lord Clarke ([152] \u00a7i):\nI do not see that the identity  of  the  discriminator  is  of  any  real  relevance  ....  There  is\ncertainly nothing in the language or the context of section 1 of the  Act  or  in  its  statutory\npurpose to limit the section in that way.\nIn the United States case, Ross v Douglas County, Nebraska 234 F 3d 391 (8th Cir 2000)  a  black\nsupervisor called a black worker \u2018black boy\u2019 and \u2018nigger\u2019. As the treatment was on the  ground  of\nthe victim\u2019s race, the supervisor was guilty of racial discrimination. And  in  Walker  Secretary  of\nthe Treasury (above), the \u2018parent group\u2019 discriminated against a person from a sub-group.\nC. Distinguishing Ethnic and Religious Groups\nThe majority speeches were quite  right  to  emphasise  the  flexibility  permitted  in  identifying  a\nracial group. However, in the context  of  this  religion\/ethnic  debate,  they  overlooked  one  very\nimportant point. The RRA  1976  was  not  enacted  to  prevent  religious  discrimination,  a  point\nemphasised in the two speeches in Mandla (at 562  and  568).  When  holding  that  Sikhs  were  a\nracial group by their ethnic origins, Lord Fraser (at 563-565) relied on a  \u2018combination  of  factors\u2019\nand noted that \u2018the [Sikh] community is no longer purely religious in character\u2019. Lord Templeman\n(at 569) noted that Sikhs were \u2018more than a religious sect\u2019.\nThe JFS majority\u2019s emphasis on flexibility led them to go further than required  to  resolve\nthe  case  in  the  claimant\u2019s  favour.  Their  speeches  suggested  Orthodox,  Masorti,  Reform,   or\nLiberal, Jewish denominations could each be defined by Mandla ethnic origins. Yet, it is  difficult\nto hold that these groups are defined  by  \u2018a  combination  of  factors\u2019  and  are  \u2018no  longer  purely\nreligious in character.\u2019 This makes it problematic for Parliament to draft an  exception  for  Jewish\n(or other Faith)  Schools,  as  religion  and  ethnic  origins  have  now  become,  in  legal  language\nanyway, virtually inseparable. Moreover, this  makes  it  very  difficult  for  employers  to  use  the\nmore liberal exceptions permitted by the Employment Equality  (Religion  or  Belief)  Regulations\n2003 (SI 2003\/1660), as like the JFS, they will face charges of racial  discrimination  (see  further\nbelow).\nThe better view is to take the bare bones of  the  decision.  The  OCR  criteria  contained  a\nracial element. The RRA 1976 only demands that the treatment is on  racial  grounds.  Thus,  it  is\nnot necessary for the victim to belong to a racial group, although that will often be  the  case.  It  is\nenough for liability that M could not meet the racial element. The complicating factor in this  case\nis that M\u2019s essential complaint was that as a Masorti Jew  he  could  not  gain  access  to  a  Jewish\nschool. But this cause of action could have been brought by anyone not \u2018racially Jewish\u2019, which is\nall M needed to argue.\nSome support for this explanation of the decision can be  found  in  Lord  Mance\u2019s  speech\n([86]):\nA test of membership of a religion that focuses on descent from a particular people is a test\nbased on ethnic origins. ... This case cannot therefore be  viewed  as  a  mere  disagreement\nbetween  different  Jewish  denominations,  It  turns,  more  fundamentally,  on  whether  it\nimpermissible for any school to treat one child less  favourably  than  another  because  the\nchild does not have whatever ancestry is required ... to make the child Jewish.\nOverall, the majority speeches confirm four rules about  applying  the  \u2018racial  group  test\u2019.\nFirst, there can be sub-groups of a racial group. Second, groups or sub-groups may overlap. Third,\na sub-group  may  include  persons  not  included  in  the  parent  group,  rather  like  Basques  and\nCatalans include some  non-Spanish  people  (each  group  straddles  the  Spanish-French  border).\nFourth, it makes no difference to liability if the discriminator belongs to the same  racial  group  as\nthe victim.\n6. DIRECT DISCRIMINATION AND THE \u2018BENIGN MOTIVE DEFENCE\u2019\nSection 1(1)(a), RRA 1976, provides that a person directly discriminates if \u2018on  racial  grounds  he\ntreats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons.\u2019 The key phrase is  \u2018on\nracial grounds\u2019. The next issue was, assuming that the descent requirement was racial, whether the\n(benign) religious motive behind it rendered the ground of the treatment  solely  religious,  and  so\nnot \u2018on racial grounds\u2019.\nThat  a  \u2018benign  motive  defence\u2019  is  still  being  argued   is   down   to   some   apparently\ncontradictory statements made by our senior judges. Some twenty years ago, the  House  of  Lords\nheld that the ground of the treatment is discovered simply by asking  if  the  defendant  treated  the\nclaimant because of the protected ground, or even more simply, by asking if the  defendant  would\nhave treated the claimant so but for the protected ground (respectively, R v Birmingham CC,  ex  p\nEOC [1989] 1 AC 1156, at 1194; James v Eastleigh BC [1990] 2 AC 751, at  774B-C).  The  point\nof this approach was to avoid questions  of  defendants\u2019  motive.  Otherwise  it  would  be  a  good\ndefence for an employer to show that he discriminated against a protected  group  not  because  he\nintended to do so but (for example) because of customer preference, or  to  save  money,  or  avoid\ncontroversy (R v Birmingham CC  [1989]  1  AC  1156  (HL),  at  1194,  and  see  R  v  CRE  ex  p\nWestminster CC [1985] ICR 827 (CA)).\nSince these  pronouncements,  a  number  of  judicial  statements  have  suggested  a  more\nsubjective approach. In Khan v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire  [2000]  ICR  1169  (CA)  [14],\nLord Woolf MR observed obiter: \u2018To regard a person as acting unlawfully when he had  not  been\nmotivated either consciously or unconsciously by any  discriminatory  motive  is  hardly  likely  to\nassist the objective of promoting harmonious  racial  relations.\u2019  On  appeal,  the  House  of  Lords\nappeared to agree by holding that the question was \u2018subjective\u2019 ([2001] UKHL 48, [29], [77])  and\nfinding no liability in a victimisation case because  the  defendant  employer  had  acted  \u2018honestly\nand reasonably\u2019. (Ibid, [31]. See also [44], [59], & [80]).\n Two years later, in a case of direct sex discrimination (Shamoon v Chief Constable  of  the\nRUC [2003] ICR 337) the House of Lords did not even mention R v Birmingham CC and James  v\nEastleigh.  Instead,  the  judgments  asked  why  the  claimant  was  treated  so.  What   few   other\ncomments  were  made  on  the  issue  suggested  that   the   finder   of   fact   should   look   for   a\ndiscriminatory motive (ibid [55] & 116]), and that the relevant circumstances  for  the  comparison\nshould be those that the defendant took into account (ibid [134]),  again  pointing  to  a  subjective\napproach.\nThe majority in JFS dealt with this apparent  confusion  by  reconciling  the  \u2018but  for\u2019  and\nsubjective approaches. They did so by identifying  two  types  of  direct  discrimination  ([21]-[23]\n(Lord Phillips), [62]-[64] (Lady Hale), [78] (Lord Mance), [114]-[117] (Lord  Kerr),  [132]  (Lord\nClarke)). There are \u2018obvious\u2019 cases, where the reason for the  treatment  is  patently  racial  (or  on\nanother prohibited ground). Presumably, an example would be \u2018No Blacks  need  apply\u2019.  In  these\ncases, there is no need to enquire into the defendant\u2019s motive, no matter how worthy it might be.\nSecond, there are \u2018less obvious\u2019, cases. Lord Phillips provided a  vivid  example  ([21]):  A\nshopkeeper says to a fat black man, \u2018I do not serve people like you.\u2019 A more realistic example was\nprovided by Lady Hale, where in  job  applications,  the  patent  criterion  is  \u2018that  elusive  quality\nknown as \u201cmerit.\u201d\u2019 In such cases it is necessary to assess the motive of the defendant  to  ascertain\nthe ground of the treatment, respectively whether it was obesity or colour,  or  merit  or  race.  The\nracial bias may even be subconscious, to be discovered  by  proper  inferences  from  the  evidence\n([64]).\nLittle was said about the actual application of the but for test. (Lord Phillips ([16]) said  he\ndid not find the test \u2018helpful\u2019.) The focus was on what the  test  was  intended  to  avoid:  a  benign\nmotive defence. The majority agreed that motive was relevant only  for  the  \u2018less  obvious\u2019  cases,\nbut only to discover the ground of the treatment.  If  the  ground  of  the  treatment  is  unlawful,  a\nbenign motive cannot prevent liability. Hence, for the majority, in this \u2018obvious\u2019 case, the school\u2019s\nreligious motive, no matter how worthy, did not preclude liability.\nThat was the technical solution of the majority. There was also a public  policy  dimension\nto this case. Nearly all the judges expressed great sympathy  for  the  predicament  of  the  School,\nhaving a definition of religion  that  included  a  racial  element.  However,  the  majority  decision\nshows that even  a  powerful  religious  argument  cannot  outweigh  the  State\u2019s  policy  on  racial\ndiscrimination.  As  Lord  Kerr  noted  ([119]),  although  it  was  \u2018logical\u2019  to  describe  the   OCR\ndefinition as a religious one,\nwhen the answer to that religious question has consequences  in  the  civil  law  sphere,  its\nlegality falls to be examined. If the decision has consequences that are not permitted under\nthe law, the fact that it was taken for a religious purpose will not save it from the condition\nof illegality.\nLord Clarke ([150]) used an extreme case to make the same point:\na person who honestly believed,  as  the  Dutch  Reformed  Church  of  South  Africa  until\nrecently believed, that God had made black people inferior and had destined  them  to  live\nseparately  from  whites,  would  be  able  to  discriminate  openly  against   them   without\nbreaking the law.\nLord Clarke cited Bob Jones University v US 461 US 574 (1983), where  the  US  Supreme  Court\nupheld the IRS decision to revoke the University\u2019s tax exempt status because it  denied  admission\nto anyone engaged in interracial marriage,  despite  this  policy  being  based  on  a  sincerely  held\nreligious belief. He also cited Campbell and Cosans v UK (1982) 4  EHRR  293,  [36],  where  the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights stated that beliefs \u2018must be worthy  of  respect  in  a  democratic\nsociety\u2019 and not be \u2018incompatible with human dignity.\u2019\nDissenting, Lords Hope ([201]) and Brown ([247]) in particular relied  on  the  defendant\u2019s\nmotive (implementing Orthodox Jewish law) to hold the ground was solely  religious.  Lord  Hope\n[197]-[199] stated that the defendant\u2019s motive was relevant even in \u2018obvious\u2019 cases. On the  Dutch\nReformed Church  analogy,  Lord  Hope  found  this  case  \u2018quite  different\u2019  ([202]),  whilst  Lord\nBrown did not consider the examples to be \u2018parallel\u2019 ([245]).\nA. Comment on Direct Discrimination\n(i) The Benign Motive Defence\nThe majority have confirmed a cardinal tenet of direct discrimination - that a benign motive  is  no\ndefence. But the failure of the minority  to  confirm  this,  and  the  majority\u2019s  failure  to  overrule\nKhan, still leaves some doubt over the matter. In Khan, it may  be  recalled,  the  claimant  worker\nhad issued proceedings for racial discrimination. In the meantime, he applied for a  job  elsewhere.\nHis employer refused to provide a job reference pending the outcome of the proceedings  because,\naccording to his legal advice, a reference might prejudice his defence at trial. The worker  brought\na secondary claim of victimisation. The  issue  was  whether  the  refusal  of  a  reference  was  \u2018by\nreason that\u2019 the  worker  had  issued  the  original  proceedings.  The  House  Lords  held  that  the\nemployer acted \u2018honestly and reasonably\u2019 on \u2018perfectly understandable\u2019 legal advice in reaction to\nthe existence (lawful) - and not the bringing (unlawful) - of  the  proceedings  ([31],  [44],  [59]  &\n[80].) Subsequently, in St Helens MBC v Derbyshire [2007]  ICR  841,  a  majority  of  the  House\ntried to explain this case as turning on the fact that claimant had suffered no detriment. (Lady Hale\nwas the exception, stating ([36]) that the \u2018honest and reasonable\u2019 defence should be \u2018laid to  rest\u2019.)\nBut  the  majority\u2019s  view  is  unconvincing  because  it  was   held   in   Khan   that   the   claimant\nhad suffered a detriment, and in any  case,  that  explanation  relied  on  the  unusual  fact  that  the\nworker\u2019s reference  would  have  been  negative,  which  would  reduce  its  value  as  a  precedent\nvirtually to nil. (See (2009) ILJ Vol 38(2) 149, pp 159-171.)\nThe point for the present purpose is that Khan reveals that the \u2018ground\u2019 or \u2018reason\u2019  for  the\ntreatment is a slippery issue. Was the ground the lawyer\u2019s advice, or the bringing  of  proceedings,\nor their existence, or the desire to avoid prejudicing the defence at trial? Of  course,  it  was  all  of\nthose things. But the exploration into the employer\u2019s motive did not help discover a reason. It was\nan exercise in semantics that provided what the House considered a just result.  The  reasons  were\nobvious, and some of them were that the claimant had issued proceedings. As such, Khan does not\nsit comfortably with the JFS majority\u2019s theory that motive is only relevant in \u2018less obvious\u2019 cases.\nOne way to solidify the JFS majority\u2019s  rejection  of  a  benign  motive  defence  for  direct\ndiscrimination is to marginalise Khan to the  victimisation  cases  only.  This  argument  has  some\nsubstance, as all cases  of  victimisation  have  to  be  poured  into  the  statutory  single  and  rigid\nformula of \u2018direct\u2019  victimisation,  which  permits  no  defence.  (See  ibid,  at  174,  proposing  an\nadditional cause of action of \u2018victimisation by proxy\u2019, that would permit a justification defence.)\n(ii) The But-For Test\nNone  of  the  majority  speeches  explained  quite  when  the  but  for  test  was  appropriate.  This\nquestion was addressed more explicitly by Underhill J in the recent case of Amnesty  International\nv Ahmed  [2009]  ICR  1450  (EAT).  He  stated  that  the  but  for  test  was  appropriate  for  both\n\u2018obvious\u2019 and \u2018less obvious\u2019 cases, although its \u2018real value\u2019 was  in  the  latter,  which  he  labelled\n\u2018mental process\u2019 cases. His approval was somewhat diluted by adding that ([37]):\nit does not matter whether you describe the mental process  involved  as  his  intention,  his\nmotive, his reason, his purpose or anything else \u2013  all  that  matters  is  that  the  proscribed\nfactor operated on his mind.\nUnderhill J further diluted its value by identifying a third category of direct  discrimination  where\nthe but for test would be \u2018misleading\u2019 ([37]). These could  be  conveniently  labelled  \u2018background\ncases\u2019.  For  instance,  in  Martin  v  Lancehawk  UKEAT\/0525\/03  a   (male)   managing   director\ndismissed a (female) worker when their affair came to an end. Of course, but for her sex the  affair\nwould never have occurred and she would not have been dismissed. The EAT held, however,  that\nshe was dismissed because of the  \u2018breakdown  of  the  relationship\u2019  and  not  because  she  was  a\nwoman.  Thus,  where  the  discriminatory  elements  merely  form  the  background   to   the   less\nfavourable treatment, the but for test should not be used.\nAlthough the majority in JFS cited the but for cases with  approval,  their  failure  to  show\nwhen it should be used did little to recommend it as the template  for  tribunals.  Coupled  with  its\nunsuitability for the \u2018background\u2019 cases, there is very little left to endorse the but  for  test.  (For  a\nfurther criticism of the but  for  test  for  mixed  motive  cases,  see  US  Supreme  Court  in  Price\nWaterhouse v Hopkins 490 US 228 (1989), at 241.)\nB. The Test for Direct Discrimination\nIt would seem that the best guide for tribunals now is to ask first  if  the  case  is  either  \u2018obvious\u2019,\n\u2018less obvious\u2019, or \u2018background\u2019. In the obvious cases, no further inquiry  should  be  necessary,  in\nthe other two cases, tribunals should  explore  the  defendant\u2019s  motive,  but  only  to  discover  the\nground of the treatment.\nBearing mind Lord Nicholls\u2019 caution in Nagarajan (at 512), that \u2018Many people are unable,\nor unwilling, to admit even to themselves that actions  of  theirs  may  be  racially  motivated\u2019,  the\nenquiry is not necessarily  one  in  search  of  a  conscious  hostile  racial  motive.  (See  also  Lord\nBrowne-Wilkinson, Glasgow CC v Zafar, [1998] ICR 120 (HL),  at  126.)  Hostile  motive  is  not\nnecessary for liability. And so the meaning of \u2018motive\u2019 in this context requires some definition.  In\nshort, it means simply the ground (or one of the grounds) of the treatment. This is  well  illustrated\nby King v Great Britain-China Centre [1992] ICR  516  (CA).  Ms  King,  who  was  Chinese  but\neducated in Britain, applied for a post at the China Centre,  an  organisation  established  to  foster\ncloser  ties  with  China.  She  met  the  requirements  of  fluent  spoken  Chinese  and  a   personal\nknowledge of China. A white English person was appointed. The circumstantial evidence was that\nnone of the five Chinese applicants made  the  short  list  of  eight  white  candidates,  and  that  no\nChinese person had ever been employed in the centre. The Court of Appeal held that the industrial\ntribunal was entitled to draw the conclusion that King was discriminated against  because  she  did\nnot come from the \u2018same, essentially British, academic background\u2019  as  the  existing  staff.  There\nwas no need to prove the defendant acted upon a hostile or conscious racial motive,  only  that  the\nground of the rejection was racial. Thus, using the defendant\u2019s motive for liability need not be  the\nlimiting factor, so long as it not used  to  bypass  the  ground  of  the  treatment  to  find  a  \u2018benign\nmotive defence\u2019.\n7. INDIRECT DISCRIMINATION\nAfter rejecting the claim of direct discrimination, the minority treated this as a case of prima  facie\nindirect discrimination, with Lords Hope and Rodger  holding  that  School  could  not  justify  the\nadmissions policy. In essence, the minority judgments conflated the  motive  and  group  issues  to\nshow that the Chief Rabbi\u2019s purely religious motive  meant  that  the  only  group  distinction  was\nreligious, and not ethnic. The flaw in that reasoning is best illustrated by an example used by Lord\nHope ([203]). He compared how the OCR treated a) a secular descendant of an  orthodox  convert,\nand b) a practising descendant of a non-orthodox convert, in order to show  that  the  OCR  motive\nwas purely religious, on the basis that the  secular  descendant  would  be  admitted.  The  example\nshows how the minority arguments missed the point. The \u2018convert rule\u2019 is merely the hurdle faced\nby those not racially Jewish. It is not the challenged rule. The challenged rule is the one  that  says\nif you are not racially Jewish you must pass the \u2018convert\u2019 test. With the challenged  rule  in  mind,\nthe comparison should be between the treatment given to a racially Jewish child and that to a non-\nracially Jewish child. One gains automatic admission, the other faces a further test.\nThus, the minority\u2019s reasoning, that the OCR rule was (on racial grounds) facially  neutral,\nled them to treat this as  a  case  indirect  discrimination.  However,  that  some  of  the  claimant\u2019s\nethnic group were not disadvantaged by the admissions policy does not automatically prevent  this\nbeing a case of direct discrimination. It is perfectly possible  to  directly  discriminate  against  just\nsome members of a protected class. Lady Hale addressed this point ([66]):\nM was rejected because of his mother\u2019s ethnic  origins  ...  The  fact  that  the  OCR  would\nhave over-looked his mother\u2019s Italian origins, had she converted to Judaism in a procedure\nwhich they would recognise, makes no difference to this fundamental fact.\nLord Mance made the same point  ([89]):  \u2018[A]n  organisation  which  admitted  all  men  but  only\nwomen graduates would be engaged in direct discrimination on the grounds of sex.\u2019\n8. RELEVANCE OF THE DECISION FOR EMPLOYERS\nAs  noted  earlier,  the  wider  range  of  defences  for  religious  preferences  throws  up  a  similar\nproblem for employers as that faced by the JFS. The Religion or Belief Regulations 2003  provide\nthree exemptions for direct religious discrimination. First, for any employer, the standard Genuine\nOccupational Requirement  (GOR),  where  the  worker\u2019s  religion  or  belief  must  be  a  genuine,\ndetermining,  and  legitimate  requirement  for  the  job;  in  addition  the  requirement  should   be\nproportionate (reg 7(2)).  The  second  exemption  is  for  organisations  with  an  ethos  based  on\nreligion or belief. The characteristic must be a requirement for the job, but not a  determining  (i.e.\ndecisive) one, having regard to the organisation\u2019s ethos (reg 7(3)). Third, \u2018schools with a religious\ncharacter\u2019  may  favour  teachers  of  the  school\u2019s  religion  (reg  39,  see  School   Standards   and\nFramework Act 1998, ss 58-60; Education (Scotland) Act 1980, s 21). Under the RRA  1976  (and\nproposed in the Equality Bill 2009), the only employment  exception  for  direct  discrimination  is\nthe standard race GOR.\nAn employer wishing to employ someone  Jewish  for  religious  reasons  runs  the  risk  of\ndirectly discriminating on racial grounds, and so would have to frame  its  requirement  within  the\nrace GOR, which is likely to be more difficult, or even impossible (there is some  doubt  as  to  the\nstatus of the race GOR, see Amnesty Int v Ahmed [2009] IRLR 884 (EAT), [59]).\nThe obvious answer, it seems, is to remove the racial criterion  from  the  requirement  and\nframe the requirement in purely religious terms, confining it to practising Jews (suggested  by  the\nCourt of Appeal [2009] EWCA Civ 626, [33]). The problem with this group \u2013 in light of  the  JFS\nmajority speeches - is that it appears to coincide with the Mandla  definition,  which  again  would\ninvite claims of racial discrimination. As noted above, the better view  is  to  reduce  the  majority\ndecision to the racial strand of the OCR criteria, and then focus  on  the  Mandla  speeches,  which\nclearly distinguished religion per se from ethnic origins.\n9. CONCLUSION\nAs noted  above,  the  obvious  difficulty  in  this  case  was  that  the  OCR\u2019s  definition  straddles\nreligious and racial factors. However, it was not that difficult to unravel the  two  and  identify  the\nracial strand. It is a pity that it has taken 610 paragraphs, 11 judicial  speeches,  and  13  judges  to\nachieve the correct result, and even that carried some problematic reasoning. This is on top  of  six\nprevious House of Lords cases on the \u2018benign motive\u2019 issue for  discrimination  and  victimisation\nand undermines any confidence that this decision will stand as a  seminal  one.  Ideally,  tribunals,\nemployers and workers would have preferred one leading speech providing clear guidance.\nWhat the majority speeches do say is that for direct discrimination at least: (1) there  is  no\nbenign motive defence, (2) the defendant\u2019s motive is relevant only in \u2018less obvious\u2019 cases,  (3)  the\nonly purpose of identifying the  motive  is  to  discover  the  ground  of  the  treatment.  For  racial\ndiscrimination, racial groups may be formed of sub-groups which may overlap, and  even  contain\npersons not in the \u2018parent\u2019 group. Finally, it is possible to for one member of a protected  group  to\ndirectly discriminate against a member of the  same  group,  or  against  just  some  members  of  a\nprotected group.\n"}
