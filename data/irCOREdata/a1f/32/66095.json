INTRODUCTION\nIN Experience Hendrix LLC v. PPX Enterprises Inc., Edward\nChalpin,1 the Court of Appeal gives further impetus to the radical\nrecasting of the law of damages for breach of contract along\nrestitutionary lines made possible by A.-G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape\nLtd. Third Party).2 Whilst Blake made it more difficult to argue\nthat hypothetical release damages were compensatory rather than\nrestitutionary in nature, it left a residue of serious uncertainty\nbecause it did not make it impossible to do so. Hendrix goes a long\nway towards eradicating this particular uncertainty by awarding\nhypothetical release damages on an unambiguously restitutionary\nbasis and saying that an account of profits, though not justified in\nthe circumstances of the case, might also have been awarded on\nthis basis. In the belief that Blake \u2018\u2018marks a new start in this area\u2019\u2019\n[para. 16], Hendrix provides, in the abstract at least, the general\nrestitutionary remedy Blake posits, of damages unified on a \u2018\u2018sliding\nscale\u2019\u2019 from partial disgorgement (by hypothetical release damages)\nthrough to complete disgorgement (by an account of profits). As\nthis sliding scale is the logical implication of Blake, it is a virtue of\nHendrix to have taken the argument to this next stage.\nUnfortunately, this pursuit of the logic of Blake necessarily\ninvolves the \u2018\u2018far reaching and disruptive\u2019\u2019 consequences for\ncommercial law feared by Lord Hobhouse in his powerful dissent\nin Blake.3 As it happens, Hendrix, the second case to follow Blake,\nis not as disruptive as the first to do so, Esso Petroleum Co.

NIAD;5 and, for\ngood or ill, the same or a better result for Experience Hendrix LLC\nmight have been reached on the law prior to Blake.6 Nevertheless,\nmaking it more likely that these far reaching and disruptive\nconsequences will come to pass is the central feature of the\nreasoning in Hendrix. Though partial and complete disgorgement\nare now available, the sliding scale which would coherently unite\nboth is the purest chimera. What appears to be a scale if the\ndiscussion is conducted at a completely abstract level is, as a\npractical matter, a very loose collection of sometimes profoundly\narbitrary damages quantifications. Even worse, purporting to\nconstruct the scale involves an argument which one of the present\nauthors dismissed as \u2018\u2018ridiculous in itself \u2019\u2019 when, some years ago, he\nperceived it as a logically possible consequence of Blake.7 To see\nthis possibility realised in Hendrix does not, we are afraid, make it\nless ridiculous, and that this distinguished Court of Appeal takes up\nsuch a position shows just how inappropriate restitutionary\ndamages would be as a generally available remedy for breach of\ncontract, though this general availability is precisely what Blake\nand now Hendrix move towards.\n2. THE SLIDING SCALE IN THEORY\nThe claimant in Hendrix is a company owned by the family of Jimi\nHendrix, who are the remaining beneficiaries of his estate. Hendrix\nwas a rock musician who died in 1970, aged 27, from an overdose\nof sleeping drugs. From the middle of 1966 until his death, Hendrix\nenjoyed enormous success and this period of his life was a\ncombination of intense musical activity and hectic personal affairs.\nThe brevity of his career has not prevented his posthumous\nreputation from being very great. All adult rock music fans would\nacknowledge that a good case can be made that he was the most\ninnovative rock guitarist who has ever played, and the claimants\ncontinue to earn very large sums from the sale of his recordings.\nIn 1965, before he became successful, Hendrix entered into an\nexclusive service agreement of three years\u2019 duration with the present\nfirst defendant, a company then and now largely under the control\nof the present second defendant, Mr. Edward Chalpin, and we shall\ntake the interests of PPX and Mr. Chalpin to be identical. Prior to\nthan Esso v. NIAD, Lawrence Collins J. (at para. [142]) was prepared to award an account on\nthe authority of Blake but did not find it necessary to do so.\n5 See note 46 below.\n6 See section 6 below.\n7 D. Harris et al., Remedies in Contract and Tort, 2nd. edn. (London 2002), p. 267. Much of\nCampbell\u2019s thinking on this topic has been formed in the course of joint work with Donald\nHarris and Roger Halson.\n606 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\n1965, Hendrix was not a \u2018\u2018featured artist\u2019\u2019. After his medical\ndischarge from the army in 1962, he became a \u2018\u2018sideman\u2019\u2019, largely\nplaying guitar in support of other artists. The 1965 exclusive service\nagreement would have confined Hendrix to being a sideman to the\nnow obscure Curtis Knight, a musician managed by Mr. Chalpin.\nIn 1967, PPX sued Hendrix for breach of this agreement, and after\nhis death continued the action against his estate. In 1973, the\naction was settled on terms which, inter alia, restricted PPX\u2019s rights\nto exploit Curtis Knight recordings on which Hendrix played and\nof which PPX possessed master copies. In 1995 and 1999, PPX\nentered into agreements with third parties to exploit these\nrecordings which Buckley J. at first instance found to be in breach\nof the 1973 settlement.8 Buckley J. granted an injunction against\nfurther exploitation of these recordings by PPX but denied damages\nor an account of profits, and it is the claimant\u2019s appeal against this\npart of the judgment that is of interest here. Dismissing other issues\nin the appeal questioning liability, the Court of Appeal held that\nboth damages and an account could have been available on\nrestitutionary grounds, though on the facts awarded only the\nformer.\nBoth before Buckley J.9 and before the Court of Appeal\n[para. 14], the claimant maintained from the outset that damages\nquantified on what it called the \u2018\u2018traditional\u2019\u2019 basis of compensation\nfor lost expectation could not be recovered for want of certainty.\nThis quantification would have required an assessment of the\nvolume of sales of the claimant\u2019s recordings lost as a result of the\nrelease of the defendant\u2019s recordings, and the claimant maintained\nthat \u2018\u2018[s]uch an assessment would, from a practical point of view,\nbe impossible\u2019\u2019.10 The claimant therefore framed two alternative\nbases of quantification: (1) \u2018\u2018the Wrotham Park Estates basis\u2019\u2019, or\n(2) an account of profits on the authority of Blake.11 What is novel\nabout Hendrix is that it puts both of these remedies on a unified\nrestitutionary footing, as a matter of doctrine at least.\nThe Wrotham Park Estates basis of course refers to Brightman\nJ.\u2019s \u2018\u2018beneficent interpretation\u2019\u201912 of Lord Cairns\u2019 Act13 in Wrotham\nPark Estate Co. Ltd. v. Parkside Homes.14 As is now well enough\nunderstood as to need no exposition here,15 these are\n\u2018\u2018hypothetical release\u2019\u2019 damages representing what the claimant\n8 Experience Hendrix LLC v.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 607\ncould have charged the defendant for permission to, in this case,\nrelease its recordings, had such permission been sought rather\nthan, as it were, simply assumed by breach. These damages have\nbeen taken to be compensation for the hypothetical lost\nopportunity to bargain for the release, but the attempt to do so in\ncases such as Jaggard v. Sawyer16 has been beset with many\ndifficulties.17 Blake has done much to put these damages on a\nrestitutionary rather than a compensatory footing. In Hendrix, the\nCourt of Appeal, without any argument that really adds to\nprevious discussions of the matter, takes it that this is the best\nfooting for these damages. Though Jaggard v. Sawyer is not\nfollowed [paras. 16, 34], no sustained argument for this is given.\nHowever, as we agree that this is the right doctrinal line to take\nafter Blake, we will say no more about it here and assess the\nconsequences of it being established that these damages are\nrestitutionary in nature.\nThe first consequence is that these damages can be described as\neffecting partial disgorgement of the wrongful profits which the\ndefendant obtains by breach. If one asks what sum the defendant\nwould have paid to be released from his contractual obligations,\nthe only answer which seems to be ruled out is 100 per cent. of the\nprofit he hopes to make, for surely it cannot be maintained that\nany rational defendant would agree to pay that price for release,\nwhich completely removes the incentive he had to seek that release.\nIn Wrotham Park, Brightman J. by no means maintained this but\ninstead awarded the claimant merely 5 per cent. of the profit the\ndefendant made.18 This is a rudimentary form of apportionment\nwhich, as we say, effects partial disgorgement of the defendant\u2019s\nprofit.\nThough the origins of the account of profits remedy lay in\nequity, it is firmly established that this may be regarded as a\nrestitutionary remedy effecting total disgorgement of the defendant\u2019s\nprofits.19 As such, it is an obvious complement to hypothetical\nrelease damages. The two together seem to provide a full range of\nrestitutionary remedies for breach of contract, on a \u2018\u2018sliding scale\u2019\u2019\nextending from various levels of partial disgorgement (hypothetical\nrelease damages) to total disgorgement (account of profits).20 This\nposition certainly was implicit particularly in Lord Nicholl\u2019s speech\n16 [1995] 1 W.L.R. 269.\n17 Harris et al., note 7 above, 255\u2013262.\n18 Wrotham Park Estate Co. Ltd. v. Parkside Homes [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798, 815\u2013816.\n19 My Kinda Town v. Soll [1983] R.P.C. 15, 55.\n20 The felicitous term \u2018\u2018sliding scale\u2019\u2019 is used by Professor Burrows in comments on the\nRestitution Discussion Group email forum: henrichment@lists.mcgill.cai.\n608 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nin Blake,21 and has been made explicit in a recent account of his\nextra-judicial views:\nOnce one had crossed the threshold of being able to recover an\naccount of profits for breach of contract, rather than\ncompensatory damages or specific relief, Lord Nicholls thought\nthat the measure of recovery could extend from expense saved\nthrough to stripping a proportion of the profits made through\nto stripping all the profits made from the breach. The\nWrotham Park Estate case (where 5 [per cent.] of the profits\nhad been stripped) was therefore based on the same principles\nas A.-G. v. Blake (where all the profits had been stripped).22\nThough, as we shall see,23 the distinction between hypothetical\nrelease damages and an account of profits does not in practice\ndisappear, looking at the matter purely from an abstract,\nclassificatory perspective, all that is left is to replace these usages\nwith \u2018\u2018partial\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018total\u2019\u2019 disgorgement and the range of\nrestitutionary remedies constituting an alternative to remedies based\non expectation will be complete.24\n3. THE LEGITIMATE INTEREST\nIf one accepts the approach set out by Blake, it would indeed, as\nthe Court of Appeal holds in Hendrix [para. 43], be \u2018\u2018anomalous\nand unjust\u2019\u2019 if PPX did not have to pay some measure of\nrestitutionary damages for the gains it made by breach. The\nobvious problem with this is that, whatever the intrinsic merits of\nthis approach, remedies for breach of contract have previously been\nbased on compensation of loss, and the generalised restitutionary\napproach threatens to demolish the structure of those remedies. To\navoid this, Blake affirms that it continues to be \u2018\u2018axiomatic\u2019\u2019 that\ndamages for breach of contract are normally compensatory25 and\nrestitutionary departures from this are, though a growing category\nwhich will be \u2018\u2018hammered out on the anvil of concrete cases\u2019\u2019,26 to\n21 Harris et al., note 7 above, pp. 261\u2013262.\n22 A. Burrows and E. Peel (eds.), Commercial Remedies (Oxford 2003), p. 129.\n23 See section 4 below.\n24 The various distinctions which have been drawn between \u2018\u2018restitution\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018disgorgement\u2019\u2019\n(e.g. L.D. Smith, \u2018\u2018The Province of the Law of Restitution\u2019\u2019 (1992) 71 Can. B. Rev. 672, 683\u2013\n694; P. Jaffey, The Nature and Scope of Restitution (Oxford 2002) chs. 4, 11\u201313; and J.\nEdelman, Gain-based Damages (Oxford 2002), ch. 3) also now disappear, in theory at least,\ninto the unified sliding scale, for in the light of Blake they now appear to be mere staging\nposts on the progress towards the creation of that scale, in which unjust enrichment itself\ndisappears into the category of wrongs: P. Birks, \u2018\u2018Unjust Enrichment and Wrongful\nEnrichment\u2019\u2019 (2001) 79 Texas L. Rev. 1767. The \u2018\u2018sliding scale\u2019\u2019 thinking is applied to a\ncritique of Edelman in A. Burrows, The Law of Restitution, 2nd. edn. (London 2002),\npp. 461\u2013462.\n25 A.-G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [1998] Ch. 439, 456E (C.A.) and [2001] 1\nA.C. 268, 282B (H.L.).\n26 Ibid., 291F (H.L.).\nC.L.J. Ain\u2019t No Telling 609\ntake place only in \u2018\u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019\u2019.27 By dispensing\nwith Jaggard v. Sawyer and related cases, Hendrix sacrifices one set\nof brakes upon the restitutionary argument to the logic of that\nargument; but that logic always meant that those brakes could not\nhold. At this stage of the progress of the restitutionary juggernaut\nit remains the case that a new set of brakes have to be\nmanufactured and applied, and Hendrix attempts to do so.\nUnfortunately, these brakes will prove to be as ineffective as the\nold.\nOne way of identifying exceptional circumstances is to find\nsomething aggravating about \u2018\u2018the moral calibre of the defendant\u2019s\nconduct\u2019\u2019:28 that it was \u2018\u2018deliberate and cynical\u2019\u2019, or involved\n\u2018\u2018skimping on performance\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018doing exactly what one promised\none would not do\u2019\u2019, have been advanced as aggravating\ncircumstances.29 Serious reflection shows all of these to be\nunsatisfactory reasons to depart from compensatory damages,30 and\nthere was a marked hesitation about all of them in the House of\nLords\u2019 hearing of Blake.31 Despite the Court of Appeal being aware\nof this [para. 28], its opinion that \u2018\u2018there has been a deliberate\nbreach\u2019\u2019 [para. 58] which involved doing \u2018\u2018the very thing [the\ndefendant] had contracted not to do\u2019\u2019 [para. 36] unarguably played\na part in its decision in Hendrix. As this means that a clear line\nover these grounds has not even been maintained between the\nHouse of Lords\u2019 decision in Blake and Hendrix, the second case to\nfollow it,32 the law is a dreadful mess.33 As we believe nothing\nultimately can be done to straighten this mess out, we leave these\nfactors related to the defendant and turn to the relative novelty in\nHendrix, its argument about a factor relating to the claimant.\nIn Blake, Lord Nicholls was anxious to avoid defining\nexceptional circumstances and said the following,34 which is quoted\nin Hendrix [para. 27]:\nNo fixed rules can be prescribed. The courts will have regard\nto all the circumstances, including the subject matter of the\ncontract, the purpose of the contractual provision that has\nbeen breached, the circumstances in which the breach occurred,\nthe consequences of the breach and the circumstances in which\nrelief is being sought.

Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [2001] 1 A.C. 268, 277G, 291D (H.L.).\n32 That the defendant \u2018\u2018did the very thing it contracted not to do\u2019\u2019 was decisive in Esso\nPetroleum Co. Ltd. v. NIAD Ltd., unreported, 22 November 2001 (Ch.D.), at [60].\n33 This was predicted in D. Campbell and D. Harris, \u2018\u2018In Defence of Breach: A Critique of\nRestitution and the Performance Interest\u2019\u2019 (2002) 22 L.S. 208, 228 n. 109.\n34 A.-G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [2001] 1 A.C. 268, 285G\u2013H (H.L.).\n610 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nexhaustive, is whether the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in\npreventing the defendant\u2019s profit-making activity, and, hence,\nin depriving him of his profit.\nThis \u2018\u2018legitimate interest\u2019\u2019 is central to Hendrix. The reasoning is\nstated with economy by Peter Gibson L.J. [para. 58]:\nbecause (1) there has been a deliberate breach by PPX of its\ncontractual obligations for its own reward, (2) the claimant\nwould have difficulty in establishing financial loss therefrom,\nand (3) the claimant has a legitimate interest in preventing\nPPX\u2019s profit-making activity carried out in breach of PPX\u2019s\ncontractual obligations, the present case is a suitable one (as\nenvisaged by Lord Nicholls [in Blake])35 in which damages for\nbreach of contract may be measured by the benefits gained by\nthe wrongdoer from the breach. To avoid injustice I would\nrequire [the defendant] to make a reasonable payment in\nrespect of the benefit it has gained.\nIt is the failure to prove substantive compensatory damages that\ngives the claimant the legitimate interest which allows it to pursue a\nrestitutionary remedy. It may well be necessary to add to this\nlegitimate interest one of the variables relating to the defendant\u2019s\nconduct in order to actually be awarded the remedy; one can\nhardly say as the position is so unclear. But let us look at the\nlegitimate interest equated with failure to prove substantive\ncompensatory damages in itself.\nThe difficulties with this equation are enormous. Before turning\nto the irremediable and disastrous ones, let us examine a perhaps\nirremediable but relatively minor one. If one takes Lord Nicholls\u2019\nwords repeated by the Court of Appeal at face value, they do not\nauthorise what was done in Hendrix.36 Lord Nicholls speaks of\n\u2018\u2018preventing the breach\u2019\u2019. The restitutionary measure which will\ncome closest to this is an account of profits, for, as we have said, if\nthe defendant has to give up all the profit he will make by breach,\nhe has no incentive to breach. But only partial disgorgement was\nawarded in Hendrix and that disgorgement will arise only if the\nbreach is not prevented but allowed to take place so that the profits\nto be disgorged will be generated.37 What is being exposed here is\nthe way that restitutionary remedies, which turn on abhorrence of\n\u2018\u2018wrongfulness\u2019\u2019 understood widely, are an uncomfortable graft onto\nthe stock of Lord Cairns\u2019 Act, the purpose of which is not to\n35 Ibid., 283H\u2013284A.\n36 This difficulty was predicted in Harris et al., note 7 above, p. 270.\n37 It is an interesting issue, noted by Mance L.J. [para. 26] but not raised by the facts of\nHendrix so far established, whether partial disgorgement should still take place even if, as it\nhappens, the defendant does not realise any profit at all from the breach. For present\npurposes, it is enough to note that the defendant will breach only when he expects to make a\nprofit (or avoid a loss), and that Lord Cairns\u2019 Act allows him to do so.\nC.L.J. Ain\u2019t No Telling 611\nprevent a nuisance, a breach, etc. but to award damages in lieu of\nan injunction, i.e. to allow the nuisance, the breach, etc. to take\nplace, and the \u2018\u2018wrongful profits\u2019\u2019 flowing therefrom to be generated\nas a result.38\nDeriving Wrotham Park damages from equity therefore must\npoint in the direction of apportionment as prevention is antithetic\nto the purpose of Lord Cairns\u2019 Act. But once these damages are\nput on a restitutionary footing, this then points in the direction of\ntotal disgorgement. If the argument is successfully mounted that\nthe defendant has wrongfully profited from, say, a breach, why is\nthe claimant confined to getting only part of those profits; or, to\nput it the other way around, why does the defendant get to keep\nany? However, though we will return to the practical implications\nof the tortured way in which Lord Cairns\u2019 Act has been\ninterpreted since Brightman J.\u2019s \u2018\u2018beneficent interpretation\u2019\u2019 of it,\nlet us allow the possibility of partial disgorgement and follow the\nresults.\nThese results are the doing of exactly what the House of Lords\ncounselled against in Johnson v. Agnew, treating Lord Cairns\u2019 Act\nas providing for \u2018\u2018the assessment of damages on [a] new basis\u2019\u2019.39 In\ndefiance of what even Goff and Jones thought \u2018\u2018historically sound\nand correct in principle\u2019\u2019,40 the claimant is now effectively allowed\nto choose between the \u2018\u2018traditional\u2019\u2019 and the \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 basis. As we\nhave seen, in Hendrix the claimant from the outset maintained that\nit could not prove a compensatory claim. By doing so, it gained the\nlegitimate interest and, if the account of profits had been granted,\nwhat it must have believed would be a considerable advantage.41\nWe do not suggest that the claimant refused to frame an\nexpectation claim when one could readily have been framed, for\nalthough complicated claims on this basis are commonly made by\nthose with a more robust attitude to quantification than the\nclaimant displays,42 Hendrix does fall into an \u2018\u2018IPish\u2019\u201943 area where\nproof problems are acknowledged.44 The recordings PPX released\nof, as has been noted, Jimi Hendrix as sideman to Curtis Knight,\ndisplay very few of Hendrix\u2019s own qualities.

This, of course, is why, damages being inadequate, an\ninjunction was granted: this is what the proceedings before Buckley\nJ. largely were about.\nBut what is to prevent a future claimant from simply declining\nto frame an expectation claim in order to press a restitutionary\nclaim which it prefers? Any at all complicated consequential loss\nclaim can easily be depicted as difficult in such a way as to allow\nthis; and, in any case, it is up to the claimant to advance evidence\nof substantial loss of any sort. Unless we envisage surreal\nstatements of claim in which the defence tries to prove that the\nclaimant is entitled to substantial damages (perhaps against the\nclaimant\u2019s denial that this is the case), Hendrix moves towards the\nactualisation of the possibility, clearly latent in Blake, of the\nclaimant having a complete freedom to elect to sue in expectation\nor restitution according to which will yield the best results for\nhim.46 It is indisputable that this possibility exists when, for\nexample, passing off 47 or a fiduciary duty is involved,48 and\ncompetent counsel will advise comparing the fruits of the different\nactions. Mehigan and Griffith\u2019s authoritative practitioners text on\nrestraint of trade says in so many words: \u2018\u2018If the plaintiff has not\nsuffered any or only minor loss or thinks that the defendant\u2019s gain\nis much greater than his loss, he may be tempted to sue for an\naccount of profits\u2019\u2019.49 Hendrix will oblige competent counsel to\nthink of this in simple contract cases,50 with the further\nconsequence that:\nIf in the future [claimants] will be able to claim wrongful\nprofits in the alternative, in every such case the claimant\u2019s\nsolicitor will be duty bound to demand extensive disclosure in\norder to find out whether such a claim is worth pursuing.51\n45 Experience Hendrix LLC v.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 613\nIt was to stop exactly this possibility arising generally in\ncontract that what is taken to be the leading authority for \u2018\u2018efficient\nbreach\u2019\u2019 in the UK, Teacher v. Calder,52 was defended in Blake,\neven as the arguments which were bound to undermine it were put\nforward.53 Similarly, The Sine Nomine,54 an arbitration award\npublished in the Lloyd\u2019s Reports which affirms the possibility of\nefficient breach after Blake, was approved in Hendrix [para. 33]; but\nthis will prove as ineffective a brake as the approval of Teacher v.\nCalder in Blake. In The Sine Nomine, the defendant owners of a\nvessel breached by withdrawing it from the service of the claimant\ncharterers. The claimants were, of course, entitled to any market\ndamages they were caused thereby,55 and indeed were awarded\nsubstantial damages of this sort.56 However, though the facts are\nnot fully laid out, it is a clear implication from those published that\nthe reason the defendant withdrew the vessel is that it wanted\neither to enter into an exceptionally lucrative alternative\ncharterparty or to make an exceptional profit by carrying its own\ncargoes.57 If the claimant was confined to market damages, this\nwould be an efficient breach in the way this is normally meant,58\nand this is what the tribunal did.59 Mance L.J. says of this case:\nThe tribunal\u2019s understandable conclusion was that an award of\nwrongful profits was inappropriate where both parties were\ndealing with a marketable commodity (the services of a ship in\nthat case) for which a substitute can be found on the market\n[para. 33].\nBut how can it be denied that, from a restitutionary perspective,\nThe Sine Nomine\u2019s denial of a restitutionary remedy (of partial\ndisgorgement by hypothetical release if not total disgorgement by\nan account) is unsupportable?60 The defendant breaches, makes a\n52 [1899] A.C. 451, 467 per Lord Davey, 462 per Lord Watson concurring.\n53 Harris et al., note 7 above, pp. 263\u2013268 and Campbell, note 51 above, 264.\n54 [2002] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 805.\n55 Ibid., at para. [3].\n56 Ibid., 805 col. 1.\n57 Perhaps influenced by language employed at ibid., paras. [4, 10], Mance L.J. [para. 33]\nexplains the breach by saying that \u2018\u2018the market had risen\u2019\u2019. With respect, this cannot be\nenough, for a general rise in the market would leave no margin between what the defendant\nhoped to gain by breach and the amount it would be liable to the claimant on normal\nprinciples, and so breach, far from being efficient, would have been senseless. There must have\nbeen what in The Sine Nomine [2002] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 805, at [10] is called \u2018\u2018an adventitious\nbenefit\u2019\u2019 to explain the defendant\u2019s conduct (and the claimant\u2019s in pursuing this claim).\n58 The tribunal refines the possible measure of \u2018\u2018wrongful profits\u2019\u2019 in a way which is theoretically\ncorrect but need not be discussed here: Ibid., at para.

However, the grounds on which\nhe argues that it \u2018\u2018may have been correct on its facts\u2019\u2019 are, with the greatest respect,\nunconvincing. The charterers did prove an expectation loss (note 56 above) and the loss\ncannot have been equal to the profits gained (note 57 above).\n614 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nprofit by so doing, and disgorges nothing (unless one somewhat\nunscrupulously regards the market damages which were paid for\ncompensatory reasons as partial disgorgement).61 Mance L.J.\u2019s\nground for distinguishing the cases simply does not speak to the\nmatter. Or rather, it shows just what contradictions the\nrestitutionary argument involves, for the circumstances he is\ndescribing would support the argument given for the existence of\nthe legitimate interest in Hendrix! If there is no substitute on the\nmarket, damages may be inadequate and an argument for some\nform of literal enforcement may arise.62 It is the fact that there is a\nsubstitute to be found on the market that will likely mean that the\nclaimant\u2019s loss will be met with adequate damages, and therefore\nthat, as Peter Gibson L.J. has it, \u2018\u2018the claimant would have\ndifficulty in establishing financial loss\u2019\u2019 [para. 58].\nIt is a very serious mistake to confine one\u2019s concept of efficient\nbreach to those breaches whereby the defendant hopes to realise an\nextra profit.63 The same efficiency lies behind breaches whereby the\ndefendant hopes to avoid extra expense.64 If these breaches fall\nsubject to the restitutionary critique, the consequences would be\ndisastrous. This clearly emerges if we consider the following\nhypothetical but absolutely straightforward cases. The defendant\nagrees to deliver generic goods to the claimant for a price of \u00a31 m.\nPart of the factory in which he intended to make the goods is then\ndestroyed by fire, and, were he to try to perform his obligations by\nrescheduling his production in order to still make the goods\nhimself, it would cost him \u00a31.5 m. to do so. These goods are\navailable on the market for \u00a31.1 m. The rational thing to do is to\nbreach. On \u2018\u2018traditional\u2019\u2019 damages rules, the defendant will be liable\nfor \u00a3100,000 market damages, that sum representing, of course, the\nexcess of the claimant\u2019s payment to a third party seller over the\ncontract price, and it is rational for the defendant to breach\nbecause this is smaller than the \u00a3500,000 extra expense which actual\n61 There appears to be an unsatisfactory concession to just this effect in The Sine Nomine itself:\n[2002] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 805, at [10].\n62 Harris et al., note 7 above, pt. 3.\n63 Ibid., chs. 1, 17 (esp. pp. 11\u201317). The argument of these chapters is run together to make the\npoint polemically in Campbell and Harris, note 33 above.\n64 Pace E. McKendrick, \u2018\u2018Breach of Contract, Restitution for Wrongs, and Punishment\u2019\u2019 in\nBurrows and Peel (eds.), note 22 above, p. 106 n. 72, readers may care to reflect on The\nPuerto Buitrago [1976] 1 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 250, 254\u2013255, in which it was denied that a claimant\nhad a \u2018\u2018legitimate interest\u2019\u2019 (in the sense of Lord Reid\u2019s dicta in White and Carter (Councils)\nLtd. v. McGregor [1962] A.C. 413, 431; discussed in Harris et al., note 7 above, pp. 160\u2013165)\nin obtaining specific performance when damages were an adequate remedy. This case is the\nmirror image of The Sine Nomine, and the reasons why it was right to confine the claimant to\ncompensatory damages in The Purto Buitrago apply to The Sine Nomine. Blake and Hendrix\nwould reverse the meaning of \u2018\u2018legitimate interest\u2019\u2019, from being an obstacle the claimant must\nclear to be awarded a remedy in excess of compensatory damages to a reason for awarding\nhim such a remedy.\nC.L.J. Ain\u2019t No Telling 615\nperformance would cause him. It is overall efficient that he do so\nbecause, whilst the defendant saves, the claimant suffers no loss of\nexpectation. On a first look, and certainly so far as the appeal\ncourts in Blake and Hendrix envisage, even the wider scope of\nrestitutionary damages should cause no problem here.\nBut let us imagine that the goods were available on the market\nfor \u00a31 m. The defendant will a fortiori wish to breach, but things\nare very different from the restitutionary perspective. The claimant\nnow has no loss on compensatory rules, and it is difficult to see\nwhy this will not generate a restitutionary claim. It is not good\nenough to say that he really has no loss for if, perhaps influenced\nby Hendrix, the claimant says he cannot prove one, how are we to\ndisagree? For argument\u2019s sake we might allow that some sort of\narrangement for compulsory disclosure may provide a way around\nthis (though things are getting very, very far fetched indeed), but\nthe underlying theoretical problem cannot be solved. For even if we\nestablish that the claimant really is compensated by nominal\ndamages because he did not, in fact, suffer a substantial loss, the\ndefendant has not had to pay for the hypothetical release from his\nobligation to deliver by which he made a saving of \u00a3500,000. He\nhas compensated the normal expectation loss but not paid a sum in\naddition to this for release. And once this is allowed, then it\nequally applies if the market price were \u00a31.1 m., for the defendant\ndid not pay for the hypothetical release which allowed him to make\na net saving of \u00a3400,000 (\u00a3500,000\u2013\u00a3100,000) in that circumstance.\nIt is, we submit, impossible to distinguish these two cases on the\nground that in one of them compensatory damages are nominal;\nthe logic of disgorgement of wrongful profits must apply to both\n(and if it applied to merely one it would still be completely\nunacceptable). It is principally for this reason that the Blake\nargument now extended in Hendrix was called \u2018\u2018ridiculous in itself \u2019\u2019\nin earlier work, because if the defendant has to pay for release in\nthese cases, commercial law as we have it will collapse.65\nThis collapse is brought closer by Hendrix, but it always was\nimplicit in the wider availability of restitutionary remedies for\nbreach of contract regarded as a wrong.66 In the restitution\nliterature,67 this issue has so far principally surfaced in the\nquestions raised against what once seemed as axiomatic as damages\n65 Harris et al., note 7 above, p. 267.\n66 Pace Burrows, note 24 above, p. 486 n. 18 and McKendrick, note 64 above, p. 105 n. 68.\n67 P.

At its best, it would not deliver\nany of the economy of doctrine which we have always been told is\nthe point of the restitutionary effort,72 for we would have to go\nround the houses which the restitution effort is now beginning to\nconstruct whereas we hitherto have been spared that labour. But\nfurthermore, what one has seen of the incoherence produced just by\ncarrying the legitimate interest from Blake to Hendrix\u2014not to\nspeak of the points about the defendant\u2019s conduct\u2014makes one\ncertain that things will become much worse in the sense that the\njourney round the houses may be very long and difficult indeed.\nThis point is, we are afraid to say, emphatically rubbed in if one\nturns, as we now do, from the conditions of making a\nrestitutionary award at all to what Hendrix tells us of how to\ndetermine whether partial or total disgorgement is appropriate.\n4. LIABILITY FOR TOTAL DISGORGEMENT\nIf one allows that liability to a restitutionary remedy was\nestablished in Hendrix, then the availability of the sliding scale\nposes a novel choice: should there be partial or total disgorgement\nwhen both are available? If any restitutionary remedy was to be\ngiven in Blake, the exceptional nature of Blake\u2019s conduct meant\nthat it had to be total disgorgement.

Phipps [1967] 2\nA.C. 46) expended in realising a profit by efficient breach.\n72 P. Birks, \u2018\u2018Definition and Division: A Meditation on Institutes 3.13\u2019\u2019 in P. Birks (ed.), The\nClassification of Obligations (Oxford 1997), ch. 1.\nC.L.J. Ain\u2019t No Telling 617\nAppeal seems to proceed on the basis of determining whether the\ndefendant\u2019s conduct was as exceptional as Blake\u2019s, for if so, it\nwould lead to total disgorgement through an account of profits.\nHowever, as it decides that that conduct was not \u2018\u2018exceptional to\nthe point where the Court should order a full account of all\nprofits\u2019\u2019 [para. 44], it concludes that only the less serious remedy of\npartial disgorgement is appropriate [paras. 44, 55]. We shall return\nto this way of approaching the matter, but for the moment let us\nlook at the reasons why it was decided that Hendrix merited only\npartial disgorgement.\nThree reasons are given [para. 37; cf. para. 29], but, with\nrespect, they reduce to one. The first two reasons are that Hendrix\nis not as \u2018\u2018sensitive\u2019\u2019 as a national security case, nor involves as\nmuch notoriety. We shall see that the second of these reasons may,\nin fact, be questionable, but even allowing both, they cannot take\nus very far. Hopefully almost every case that will ever be heard will\nbe distinguishable from Blake on this basis, and certainly every\nnormal commercial case of the sort that caused concern to Lord\nHobhouse will be. We are left with the third reason, that \u2018\u2018there is\nno direct analogy between PPX\u2019s position and that of a fiduciary\u2019\u2019.\nWe are in deep waters indeed here, and the precise way this is\nput by Mance L.J. is important. It is not obvious that there was a\nprivate law interest (based on Blake\u2019s signing the Official Secrets\nAct as a condition of obtaining employment with the security\nservices) in Blake at all.73 But even allowing that there was, it was\ncategorically found that Blake was not a fiduciary.74 This is but\ngrudgingly recognised in Hendrix [para. 29], but, of course, this is\nthe significance of Blake as a restitutionary case. Had Blake been a\nfiduciary, an account of profits would have been awarded against\nhim at first instance.75 Leaving aside the extraordinary features of\nBlake, it is completely settled that an account may be awarded for\nbreach of a fiduciary duty. The entire doctrinal point of Blake is\nthat the House of Lords awarded an account for a simple breach\nof contract.\nThe advance of restitution must be somewhat undermined if,\nhaving in Blake got rid of the necessity of finding a fiduciary\nobligation to justify the award of an account of profits, one found\nthat necessity restored in Hendrix.76 And it is this that Mance L.J.\u2019s\n73 A.-G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [1997] Ch. 84, 93B (Ch.D).\n74 Ibid., 91E\u201396D.\n75 Ibid., 96E\u201397A.\n76 It may well be possible to construct an argument on the basis of a close reading of Mance\nL.J.\u2019s judgment that adheres to the distinction between restitution and disgorgement: see note\n24 above. It is hard, however, to recover a ratio from Hendrix that does so, and impossible to\ndo so from the judgment of Peter Gibson L.J. Most importantly, the logic of the wrongful\nprofits argument informing Hendrix undermines this distinction, as we are arguing.\n618 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\ncareful wording seeks to avoid. In Blake, Lord Nicholls found that\nBlake\u2019s contractual obligation not to disclose official information\nwas \u2018\u2018closely akin to a fiduciary obligation, where an account of\nprofits is a standard remedy in the event of breach\u2019\u2019, and this is\ndrawn upon in Hendrix [para. 29] to distinguish PPX\u2019s breach, for,\nit will be recalled: \u2018\u2018there is no direct analogy between PPX\u2019s\nposition and that of a fiduciary\u2019\u2019. There are, of course, tolerably\nsettled if hardly immutable rules about what does and what does\nnot constitute a fiduciary relationship. But no direct reference to\nthese rules would be to the purpose here, for the last thing we are\nable to do is argue that PPX was a fiduciary; we must show it was\nin a position analogous to a fiduciary.\nBut, of course, if a party analogous to a fiduciary gets a remedy\npreviously given only to fiduciaries, then in the sense most\nimportant in the common law that party is a fiduciary: ubi\nremedium ibi jus. And for this reason Hendrix is the latest in the\nline of restitutionary arguments that have had the effect of\nbroadening the class of fiduciaries, the second to do so in reliance\non what prior to Blake would have been thought a flat\ncontradiction or a misuse of terms77 but which Blake clearly makes\npossible: \u2018\u2018the characterisation of a contractual obligation as\nfiduciary\u2019\u2019.78 We do not want to enter into the argument in\nprinciple here, for what we would say in defence of the \u2018\u2018self-\ndenying ordinance\u2019\u201979 which we believe should be observed here has\nbeen said by others:80 \u2018\u2018Fiduciary duties should not be\nsuperimposed on . . . common law duties simply to improve the\nnature or extent of the remedy\u2019\u2019.81 What we want to point to is the\nabsurdity of treating the facts of Hendrix as justifying the extension\nof fiduciary obligations.\nThe, as it were, ethical atmosphere of Blake was dominated by\nconcern not to allow a person to profit from wrongdoing which\ninvolved despicable conduct. It was no technical issue of the nature\nof the wrong involved in breach of contract that guided the Court\nof Appeal and the House of Lords in Blake. But as Lord\nHobhouse pointed out in Blake,82 it is wrong to allow the search\nfor a \u2018\u2018just response\u2019\u201983 or \u2018\u2018practical justice\u2019\u201984 to dominate appeal\n77 Lord Millett, \u2018\u2018Equity\u2019s Place in the Law of Commerce\u2019\u2019 (1998) 114 L.Q.R. 214, 225.\n78 A.-G. v.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 619\ncourt reasoning even in the circumstances of Blake, and, even more\nthan this, there is the question of the precedent doing so sets for\nother cases.85\nIn Hendrix, the Court of Appeal is pleased that it has obtained\n\u2018\u2018practical justice\u2019\u2019 [para. 42] by preventing the \u2018\u2018anomalous and\nunjust\u2019\u2019 outcome of PPX avoiding paying for the use of the master\ncopies \u2018\u2018by simply breaching the agreement\u2019\u2019 [para. 43]. But Buckley\nJ. was quite right to conclude that he \u2018\u2018could not begin to\ncompare\u2019\u2019 Hendrix with Blake,86 for the cases are very different\nindeed. Some detail of the career of Jimi Hendrix beyond that to\nbe found in the judgments is very helpful here.87 The settlement\nwhich PPX breached by exploiting the recordings was, as we have\nsaid, of litigation PPX had brought against Hendrix for breach of\nan exclusive service agreement entered into in 1965. There can be\nno doubt that Hendrix deliberately breached this agreement; indeed\nthis breach is quite a famous episode in the history of rock music.\nRegretting the 1965 agreement virtually as soon as he made it,\nHendrix almost immediately and repeatedly broke it by playing\noutside of its confines surreptitiously. It was whilst playing in his\nown band under the alias of Jimmy James in Greenwich Village in\nJune 1966 that Hendrix was \u2018\u2018discovered\u2019\u2019 by Chas Chandler, a very\nwell established rock musician. Chandler then took Hendrix from\nNew York to London and there formed and promoted the Jimi\nHendrix Experience, the band which provided the platform for\nHendrix\u2019s great success.\nHendrix\u2019s playing when he was discovered and during the period\nwhen the Jimi Hendrix Experience shot to fame was all in clear\nbreach of the 1965 agreement, and, especially until the 1973\nsettlement, Hendrix or those with rights derived from him were in\nconstant dispute with Mr. Chalpin. In (the admittedly all more or\nless hagiographic) biographies of Hendrix, Mr. Chalpin is always\ncriticised and the 1965 agreement is always referred to as\n\u2018\u2018punitive\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018ill-advised\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018miserly\u2019\u2019, etc.88 That agreement\nunarguably had a great deal of the quality made familiar by\nSchroeder Music Publishing Co. v. Macaulay.89 In Hendrix, Mance\nL.J. hints [paras. 7, 39] that it was an exploitative agreement.\n85 Ibid., 299D\u2013E.\n86 Experience Hendrix LLC v. PPX Enterprises Inc., Edward Chalpin [2002] EWHC 1353 (Q.B.),\nat [50].\n87 In his capacity as one of the leading authorities on the career of Jim Hendrix, Mr. Paddy\nIreland has referred us to H. Shapiro and C. Glebbeek, Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy (London\n1995), pp. 95\u2013107 as the best account of this period of Hendrix\u2019s career. (See also the other\nentries for \u2018\u2018Chalpin\u2019\u2019 in the index). We have read other biographies of Hendrix and their\naccounts of this period do not materially differ from Shapiro and Glebbeek, although all have\na more histrionic tone.\n88 These epithets are taken from the biography of Hendrix in the BBC\u2019s Music Artist Database.\n89 [1974] 1 W.L.R. 1308.\n620 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nNevertheless, it was an agreement, and it was not set aside90 but\nsettled on terms which divided the benefits and burdens between\nthe parties. The current litigation therefore arises to protect rights\nwhich certainly were obtained by breach, and, what is more, a\ndeliberate (indeed a repeated, deceitful and prolonged in the face of\nthe non-breaching party\u2019s manifest disapproval) breach which\nwould be regarded as a notorious episode in the history of rock\nmusic were it not that such breaches by artists are generally viewed\npositively by those who write that history. If this was not enough,\nit seems clear that had Hendrix been more forthright at the outset,\nall this litigation could have been avoided. Chandler sought to buy\nHendrix out of all his commitments (he was under contract to\nothers in addition to PPX), but was unintentionally or otherwise\ndeceived by Hendrix, who did not tell him about Chalpin.91 There\ncan be little doubt that at that time Hendrix could have been\nbought out of his commitments to Chalpin for a pittance.\nMance L.J. evidently did not feel the analogy between Blake\nand Hendrix was strong enough to justify an account, but he must\nhave believed it strong enough to justify the hypothetical release\ndamages which come lower down the sliding scale. But it is, we feel\nobliged to say, simply ridiculous to hold that any analogy can be\ndrawn between Blake and Hendrix for the purposes of legitimating\nany restitutionary remedy. Blake is an absolutely outre\u00b4 case to\nwhich only one previous case in recent English litigation can be\ncompared, the Spycatcher case, where the use of the same\nrestitutionary argument92 was advocated.93 In our opinion, although\nBlake\u2019s turpitude does not excuse what was done in Blake, no-one\ncan fail to sympathise with the motivation behind the decision. But\nthe corollary of depicting the breach as a wrong which generates\nthe \u2018\u2018temptation to do justice\u2019\u201994 must be that the claimant is clearly\n90 Mance L.J. at one point observes that \u2018\u2018the litigation about the agreement dated 15th.\nOctober 1965 was not going well for PPX\u2019\u2019 [para. 39]. We are unable to do more than\nspeculate on the basis of what we know of the 1965 agreement, but it would appear that any\nsuch difficulties must stem from the Schroeder v. Macaulay quality of that agreement leading\nPPX\u2019s counsel to fear the court would not take too harsh a view of Hendrix\u2019s breach; i.e. the\nexact opposite of that view of breach which cases like Hendrix are seeking to promote: cf.\nCampbell, note 38 above, 139\u2013140. The settlement of the US part of the earlier litigation is,\nhowever, described as follows in Shapiro and Glebbeek, note 87 above, p. 291: \u2018\u2018[whether the\n1965 agreement was enforceable] was never put to the test; Chalpin pressed his suit against\nWarner Brothers [whose rights were derived from Hendrix] in America, who rolled over and\nsettled. Why? Possibly because, having seen Jimi\u2019s earning potential, they didn\u2019t want to take\nany chances of lengthy litigation putting a freeze on their ability to release his material and\nearn them far more than they could ever lose in court. There was also a risk that the court\nwould find in favour of Ed Chalpin and declare all subsequent agreements null and void. So\nEd Chalpin received a very favourable settlement\u2019\u2019.\n91 Ibid., p. 106\n92 P. Birks, \u2018\u2018A Lifelong Obligation of Confidence\u2019\u2019 (1989) 105 L.Q.R. 501.\n93 A.-G. v.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 621\nin an ethically superior position, and this is the import of the\ndescription of the non-breaching party in Blake as \u2018\u2018innocent\u2019\u2019.95\nHowever, it will never be black and white in this way when it\ncomes to applying Blake to more usual commercial cases. Hendrix\nmerely takes to an extreme the incoherence which is bound to\nfollow from disregarding the core aim of the law of contract, to\ngive effect to the agreement of the parties, in order to respond to\nwhat are wrongs according to the restitutionary reclassification of\nobligations. It is a most important virtue of freedom of contract\nthat it allows the court to avoid this incoherence by avoiding, so\nfar as is possible,96 the imposition of exogenous moral criteria on\ncommercial dealings at all.\nThat we are obliged to point this out in a comment on a\ndecision of the Court of Appeal would be remarkable had it not\nlong been clear that this replacement of the parties\u2019 valuations of\ntheir conduct by exogenous ones supplied by restitutionary theories\nof unjust enrichment, wrongfulness, corrective justice, etc. is at the\nheart of the restitutionary recasting of remedies for breach.97\nHendrix is not the worst example we have so far seen. Disapproval\nof City of New Orleans v. Firemen\u2019s Charitable Association98 played\na large part in getting the argument for the expansion of restitution\ngoing in this country,99 and clearly formed part of the mental\natmosphere of Blake.100 Rearrangement of the outcome of this case\nwas advocated, although this was a contract which was not even\nbreached!101 At least in Hendrix there was a breach, albeit a breach\nof an obligation which the defendant undertook as a consequence\nof the other party\u2019s prior breach. This is, we suppose, an\nimprovement, but surely not sufficient to stir up the indignation\nnecessary to give colour to appeals to \u2018\u2018practical justice\u2019\u2019. The\nrestitutionary argument takes us deep into territory which the\nlegitimacy of the law of contract has been based upon refusing to\nenter, and Hendrix graphically shows us how wise that refusal has\nbeen.\nHendrix is, then, a signal failure in its attempt to distinguish the\ngrounds on which a party in breach may be confined to partial or\ngranted total disgorgement. All we know about these grounds are\n95 A.-G. v. Blake (Jonathan Cape Ltd. Third Party) [2001] 1 A.C. 268, 278 (H.L.).\n96 D. Campbell and H.

We learn nothing of the extent of\nthe analogy except that it involves some sort of moral\ndisapprobation connected to wrongfulness. What little had\npreviously emerged about the boundaries of wrongfulness102 cannot\nbut be obfuscated by Hendrix\u2019s finding that rights acquired by\nbreach come within those boundaries! This is, we are sorry to have\nto conclude, a joke at the expense of a restitutionary argument\nwhich is intended to remove \u2018\u2018discretionary remedialism\u2019\u2019103 from\nthe law.\n5. THE SLIDING SCALE IN PRACTICE\nThis regrettable situation does not exhaust all that is unsatisfactory\nabout Hendrix. So far we have looked at its shortcomings for\ndefendants. We must now turn to its shortcomings for claimants in\ngeneral, and Experience Hendrix LLC in particular.\nThe doctrinal attractions of the sliding scale are obvious:\nrestitutionary remedies following breach appear to be theoretically\nunified into a scale and coherent damages quantifications would\nseem to follow. But, partly because the gap between the\nhypothetical release and an account of profits cannot actually be\nsmoothed away, these attractions have very little practical substance\nindeed; and once this is realised, the entire edifice collapses. When\nthe claimant turned away from compensatory remedies because of\nquantification problems and sought an account, surely it was\nimplicit that the account would be easier to quantify. But, of\ncourse, long experience of accounts shows that this is not so.104 An\nimportant subsidiary issue in Hendrix was the claimant\u2019s attempt to\nenlist the Court\u2019s assistance in securing the information needed to\nobtain an account, the claimant having no confidence in an\nundertaking to account provided by the defendant [paras. 47\u201349].\nHendrix is in an area which is the natural habitat of search and\nfreezing orders, the \u2018\u2018nuclear weapons\u2019\u2019 of commercial litigation.105\nAs has been said in previous work:\nan account of profits in practice suffers from defects similar to\nthose encountered in quantifying damages for loss of future\nbusiness. Logically, the plausibility of this remedy rests on [the\nclaimant] being able to provide evidence of the gains [the\ndefendant] has made by his wrongful conduct, and this must\n102 S.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 623\nencounter proof problems analogous to those [the claimant\u2019s]\nown expectation claim must encounter, with the added very\nserious complication that the evidence must be sought from\n[the defendant], who obviously will not wish to provide it.106\nTo turn from an expectation claim to an account is to jump out\nof the frying pan into the fire; but if one turns away from an\nexpectation claim to hypothetical release, the case is even worse: a\njump into the blast furnace. Consideration of the cases shows that,\nin the face of the want of evidence, the Court has often reached\nsome very rough and ready quantifications of accounts.107 But at\nleast in an account one has a clear goal of disgorging all of the\ndefendant\u2019s gains. What proportion is to be disgorged for\nhypothetical release? We do not want to dwell on a point that has\nbeen extensively discussed in earlier work but merely sum up the\nconclusion of that work: what has so far prevailed in hypothetical\nrelease cases since Wrotham Park is complete arbitrariness made\ntolerable by moderation, and there is no way whatsoever in which\nthis can be changed.108\nWhen awarding the claimant in Wrotham Park \u00a32,500,109\nBrightman J. acted in the usual way in Lord Cairns\u2019 Act cases, for\nfaced with the necessity of making an award about which he could\nsay nothing except that it was \u2018\u2018fair\u2019\u2019, he acted with \u2018\u2018great\nmoderation\u2019\u2019. However, the fact that Brightman J. knew that, by\nawarding \u00a32,500, he was awarding 5 per cent. of the \u00a350,000 the\ndefendant expected to make by its breach, was most unusual in\nmodern hypothetical release cases. In most such cases, no evidence\nof the defendant\u2019s profit has been available, and so the \u2018\u2018remedy\u2019\u2019 has\nbeen the purest guesswork: an arbitrary apportionment of a sum\nwhich is not even known. One awaits the conclusion of the\nlitigation in Hendrix with interest, for so far it too has been a case\nin which there has been no evidence of the profit the defendant\nmade by breach [para. 14].\nThe conclusion which must be faced is that Hendrix manifests\nthe gross logical fallacy at the heart of the legitimate interest point.\nIf the legitimate interest is generated by the difficulty of\nconsequential loss quantification, then to turn from this to an\naccount, where evidential difficulties routinely lead to very rough\nand ready approximations, or to hypothetical release damages, the\nconceptual difficulties of which typically have led to the\nabandonment even of a pretence of principled quantification, is, we\n106 Harris et al., above note 7, p. 571.\n107 E.g.

Parkside Homes [1974] 1 W.L.R. 798, 815\u2013816.\n624 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nare sorry to say, lamentable. It would always be possible to provide\na compensatory damages quantification if one only had to achieve\nthe standard of what is commonly done in the quantification of\naccounts and of hypothetical damages,110 and therefore the whole\nargument just falls. The explanation of why this logical absurdity\nhas been put forward in Hendrix must refer to the hidden text in\nthe case, or rather to two hidden texts. The first is the, as it were,\nacademic text: Hendrix is a vehicle for the promotion of\nrestitution,111 and one can see what is being done here. The\npractical text is more complicated.\nBefore the thoughts of a number of leading academics,\npractitioners and judges became so focused upon restitution, a\nclaimant facing a situation where he feared he would be\ninadequately compensated by a compensatory damages award\nwould seek literal enforcement, and in a case like Hendrix the\nappropriate remedy was the injunction which was indeed obtained.\nA prohibitory injunction is, of course, a remedy for the future, in\nthis case against \u2018\u2018yet further exploitation\u2019\u2019112 of the recordings. It\nmight be the case that between the breach and the judgment, the\ndefendant had made profits by the breach, and, in the right case,\nhe could be made to disgorge these \u2018\u2018past profits\u2019\u2019 by an account of\nprofits as a supplemental equitable remedy. This is what is sought\nin Hendrix [para. 36]. Though the transcripts of the case do not\nallow one to be certain,113 it would seem likely that the claimant\ndid not originally seek to supplement its injunction with an account\n[para. 14], and when it amended its statement of claim to do so,\nperhaps influenced by the very harsh comments Professor Birks has\nmade about equity,114 or by the atmosphere left by those\ncomments, it framed that claim in a most thoroughly restitutionary\nway, directly upon Blake.\nWe recall that as a first alternative to the compensatory damages\nwhich it maintained would be nominal, the claimant asked for an\naward on \u2018\u2018the Wrotham Park Estates basis\u2019\u2019, or, as a second\nalternative, for an account on the authority of Blake. It is, with due\nrespect, not obvious why it did so. It did obtain partial\ndisgorgement via hypothetical release, but, unless Experience\nHendrix LLC receives novel treatment indeed when the damages\n110 E.g. Joseph v. National Magazine Co. Ltd.

The awards so far made\non a Wrotham Park basis have been so moderate that it is hard to\ndistinguish them from nominal damages,115 and so to see in what\nway they really differ from the compensatory award and therefore\nwhat the point of them is.116 The award of \u00a32,500 in Wrotham Park\nitself worked out at \u00a3116 per house and the defendant kept a\nmargin of \u00a347,500 from the gains yielded by the breach. A result\nlike this may well fail to satisfy Experience Hendrix LLC. Parallels\nto hypothetical release damages are, of course, available in\nsituations like Hendrix without reliance on restitution, either for\nbreach of common law restraint of trade117 or under some\nprovision related to intellectual property,118 and they may well be\nhigher,119 though admittedly quantifications are so woolly in these\n\u2018\u2018licence damages\u2019\u2019 cases that it is hard to be precise.120\nIf the claimant had obtained total disgorgement via an account\nof profits, no doubt it would have been better pleased, and it is not\nclear to us from the merits as we are able to understand them from\nthe materials available to us why it did not try to get this by\npleading an infringement of an intellectual property right or even\nby passing off.121 In this way it could have tried to get that account\nby relying on statute or settled equitable authority rather than by\nrelying on the winner of the very strongly contested prize of most\ncontroversial contract case decided by the House of Lords in the\nlast twenty years.\n115 There is an exception which proves the rule: Marine and General Mutual Life Assurance\nSociety v.

In Redrow Homes Ltd. v. Betts\nBothers plc. [1999] 1 A.C. 197, it was held that normal compensatory damages under the\n1988 Act, s. 96(2) and \u2018\u2018additional\u2019\u2019 damages under s. 97(2) were available only in the\nalternative to an account of profits.\n119 In Ludlow Music Inc. v.

It is difficult to see that sufficient sums would have\nbeen involved to justify continuation of these proceedings after the injunction had been\nawarded unless these recordings were sold as \u2018\u2018Jimi Hendrix\u2019\u2019 recordings.\n626 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\nMuch of what Mance L.J. says in Hendrix [paras. 39\u201341] leads\none to believe that he would have looked sympathetically on\n\u2018\u2018IPish\u2019\u2019 arguments. But no doubt there were all sorts of difficulties\nwith these arguments of which we are unaware which prevented the\nclaimant from pursuing them.122 For present purposes, the point is\nthat to do so the claimant would have had to show something in\naddition to simple breach of contract to gain the remedy; the\ntortious element of passing off or the intellectual property right.\nThe point of the claimant\u2019s argument in Hendrix is to make all this\nunnecessary by making these additional factors unnecessary, just as\nBlake purported to make the additional factor of a fiduciary\nrelationship unnecessary, and therefore obtain the wider remedy for\nsimple breach of contract. As the account of profits was not\nawarded in Hendrix, we are left in the \u2018\u2018analogous to a fiduciary\u2019\u2019\nhalf-way house. But, having, we believe, raised serious objections to\ntreating Hendrix as anything other than a contract case if the\nadditional element could not be shown, we wish to generalise from\nthis to say that it is important that what has so far been erected of\nthe half-way house should be demolished rather than that we\nproceed to its completion.\nIn World Wide Fund for Nature v. World Wrestling Federation\nEntertainment Inc.,123 heard about a year before Hendrix, Jacob J.,\nwe respectfully submit, took the right line.124 A claimant who had\nbeen awarded an injunction for breach of a restraint of trade also\nsought to amend its statement of claim to seek an account on the\nauthority of Blake. Like so many cases in the truly burgeoning\nareas of business information and intellectual property law, W.W.F.\ndoes not fit comfortably into the existing legal categories, which are\ncontinually being stretched by highly competent claimants\u2019 counsel\npleading to usually extremely receptive commercial courts. The\nrestraint was, in essence, over the use of the initials \u2018\u2018W.W.F.\u2019\u2019\nshared by the parties, and so had some of the colour of a\ntrademark case, although Jacob J. quite rightly insisted this was a\nrestraint case. Having done so, he distinguished W.W.F. from Blake\nand denied the account in clear terms:\n[In W.W.F.] all one really has . . . is a negative covenant. The\nfact that it relates to the use of initials and so is a bit\n\u2018\u2018trademarkish\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018IPish\u2019\u2019 does not mean the common law\nshould provide what Parliament provides by statute for an\n122 We are grateful to Mr. Howard Johnson for describing to us in detail what these may have\nbeen.\n123 World Wide Fund for Nature v.

Ain\u2019t No Telling 627\ninfringement of a registered mark or intellectual property right\n. . . I conclude that the proposed amendment should not be\nallowed.125\nAnyone at all familiar with intellectual property law will see\nmany parallels between the language of that law and the language\nnow being used in the argument for the widening of restitution.\nRestitutionary arguments often cast longing looks at the account of\nprofits remedy as it is applied in intellectual property cases,126 and\nthe extension of intellectual property reasoning to simple contracts\nwas clearly invited by Lord Nicholls\u2019 speech in Blake.127 We would\nno longer have \u2018\u2018breach\u2019\u2019 but rather \u2018\u2018wilful infringement\u2019\u2019 by a\n\u2018\u2018cynical and deliberate\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018wrongdoer\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018pirate\u2019\u2019. These parallels\ncertainly are strong, but rather than this being to the good, it\nshould scream out a warning about what is being proposed. It is\nnot merely that our leading intellectual property judges are\npresently arguing that copyright in particular already gives\nclaimants excessive rights;128 nor that the economic and legal\njustifications for intellectual property are questionable.129 It is that,\nfor good or ill, intellectual property rights are not based on\ncontractual relationships but on monopolies granted by the state on\nthe grounds that it is necessary to radically intervene in what would\nbe the outcome of competition. Despite the vulgar understanding to\nthe contrary, intellectual property rights are not of the market but\noust the market, and this should make us extremely cautious about\nextending remedies thought appropriate in that sphere to simple\ncontract, for simple contract is, of course, the legal foundation of\ncompetition.\n6. CONCLUSION\nBy not attempting to use the arguments that were available to it\nprior to Blake, Experience Hendrix LLC may have allowed an\nacademic agenda to take precedence over a practical one; but this\ntriumph of the academic over the practical is something that\ncertainly characterises Blake, and was said in Blake about the line\n125 World Wide Fund for Nature v.

Hendrix\nshows that we are in the midst of the period of very expensive\nmischief 131 which will have to be endured whilst the attempt to\nplace remedies for breach of contract on a restitutionary basis\nworks its way out of the appeal courts. One may frame the hope\nthat this is happening quickly, and indeed there is a striking\nparallel between the brilliant but quickly vanishing efflorescence of\nthe career of Jimi Hendrix and the career of restitution for the\nwrong of breach of contract in the appeal courts. There was a\ndistinct loss of confidence in the \u2018\u2018skimping\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018doing what one\npromised not to do\u2019\u2019 arguments between the Court of Appeal and\nthe House of Lords\u2019 hearings of Blake, and that these arguments\nstill play a role in Hendrix is inconsistent with what is explicitly\nsaid of them in that case. The \u2018\u2018legitimate interest\u2019\u2019 argument which\nHendrix emphasises also involves, we say with all respect, manifest\ninconsistencies. We do not wish to argue that expectation damages\nwork perfectly well, or even as well as one imagines a reformed\nsystem of remedies might work, but Hendrix is clear evidence that\nthe general restitutionary alternative is very markedly inferior. If\nthe remedy sought in Hendrix could have been obtained by means\navailable prior to Blake, Hendrix may be a pointless case. However\nthis is, dealing with it in a way heavily influenced by Blake has led\nthe Court of Appeal to produce a judgement that is, with all\nrespect, undermined by some very weak arguments.\nThat the career of restitution for wrongful breach of contract\nshows signs of emulating the brevity of that of Jimi Hendrix\nhimself shows just how mistaken is the restitutionary effort to\ndisplace expectation in contract. By seeking to impose an external\ncriterion of wrongfulness on the parties\u2019 conduct, substituting their\nvaluations of that conduct for the parties\u2019 own, the proponents of\nrestitution are running against basic freedom of contract, and\ntherefore against the core of the legitimacy of the market economy\nand the liberal democratic polity. Even the extremely distinguished\nacademics, practitioners and judges who have so exhorted\nrestitution for wrongs since Birks\u2019 Introduction appeared in 1985132\nare a really rather feeble force when opposed to this, and once they\nrealise what they have done in Blake, they will resile from it.\n130 A.-G. v.

For any adult who places any value on rock\nmusic, Hendrix has left a number of excellent songs. But\nrestitution\u2019s general application to contract will yield nothing\npositive. In the course of the appeal courts finding this out, we will\nat least gain the benefit of learning just how inappropriate general\nrestitutionary damages are to the market economy. But, of course,\nserious reflection on the reason why expectation rather than\nrestitutionary damages became the default rule in contract remedies\nin the first place,133 and therefore are the legal basis of the market\neconomy, would have made this lesson unnecessary.\n133 Harris et al., note 7 above, ch. 1.\n630 The Cambridge Law Journal [2003]\n"}
