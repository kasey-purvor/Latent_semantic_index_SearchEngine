Many aspects\nof support are strongly influenced by a product\u2019s design and so customer support\nrequirements should be evaluated during new product development. However,\nresearchers have largely ignored the relationship between new product development\nand customer support. The current study addressed this gap by using case studies and\na workshop, both conducted with leading companies, to identify how customer\nsupport is typically evaluated at the design stage and to determine the importance of\nthis aspect of new product development. The results have implications for managers\nresponsible for product innovation\u2014they show the need to allocate adequate resources\nto integrating customer support requirements into new product development.\nKEYWORDS\nCustomer support; new product development; design for supportability\nINTRODUCTION\nEnd-users of many types of product, ranging from computer systems to domestic\nappliances, require customer support at some time\u2014assistance to help them gain\nmaximum value from their purchases. Typical forms of support include installation,\ndocumentation, maintenance and repair services (generally termed field service), and\n3user training. In fact customer support entails all activities \u201cto ensure that a product is\navailable for trouble-free use to consumers over its useful life span\u201d (Loomba, 1998).\nCustomer support, which is also referred to as product support, after-sales\nservice, technical support, or simply service, is important for manufacturers because\nit:\n\uf0b7 Is essential for achieving customer satisfaction and good long term relationships\u2014\nas identified by a number of researchers (Armistead and Clark, 1992; Athaide et al,\n1996; Cespedes, 1995; Christopher et al, 1991; Davidow, 1986; Lele and Sheth,\n1987; Teresko, 1994).\n\uf0b7 Can provide a competitive advantage (Armistead and Clark, 1992; Davidow, 1986;\nGoffin, 1998; Hull and Cox, 1994). This is true in most high-tech industries\n(Goffin, 1994; Lawless, and Fisher, 1990; Meldrum, 1995) but also in some low-\ntech sectors (Moriarty and Kosnik, 1989). As product differentiation becomes\nharder in many markets, companies are increasingly looking to customer support as\na potential source of competitive advantage (Loomba, 1998). A number of\nexamples of how companies have won market share through good support can be\nfound in the trade press [see for example (Goffin, 1994)].\n\uf0b7 Plays a role in increasing the success rate of new products (Cooper and\nKleinschmidt, 1993);\n\uf0b7 Needs to be fully evaluated during new product development (NPD), as good\nproduct design can make customer support more efficient and cost-effective\n(Armistead and Clark, 1992; Berg and Loeb, 1990; Cespedes, 1995; Goffin, 1998).\nAlthough there is ample anecdotal evidence that customer support is an essential\naspect in the marketing of many products, the relationship between customer support\n4requirements and NPD is not adequately understood. Therefore, exploratory research\nwas conducted which had two main objectives:\n\uf0b7 To investigate the role of after-sales support in five different sectors\u2014covering\nboth simple and complex products\n\uf0b7 To investigate how different companies evaluate customer support requirements\nduring new product development\nThe results show that customer support is highly important in a range of markets with\nvastly different products\u2014from domestic appliances, to passenger aircraft.\nAdditionally, the research shows the need to address support requirements at the\ndesign stage. The results have implications for all managers responsible for NPD, in\nany industry where support plays a significant role.\nCUSTOMER SUPPORT\nThe Importance of Customer Support\nAs already explained, good customer support is a prerequisite for achieving customer\nsatisfaction; it can increase the success rate of new products and directly contribute to\ncompetitive advantage. In addition, it can be a major source of revenue for\nmanufacturers (Berg and Loeb, 1990; Hull and Cox, 1994; Knecht, et al 1993). In fact,\nthe total worldwide market for high-tech support is estimated at $400 billion\n(Blumberg, 1992) and the importance of support revenues to manufacturing\ncompanies in a range of industries has been identified (Knecht, et al 1993). Over the\nworking lifetime of a product, the support revenues from a customer may be far higher\nthan the initial product revenue (ibid). Despite the importance of customer support as\na source of both revenue and profit, it is an area that has often only received scant\nattention from managers (Knecht et al, 1993). Perhaps as a result of this lack of\n5management attention given to customer support, it has also failed to attract the\nattention of management researchers (Hull and Cox, 1994). This is in stark contrast to\nthe amount of previous research on what is termed customer service.\nCustomer Support in Context\nIt is important to see understand how the topic of customer support relates to the\nextensive literature on customer service. Customer service\u2014the way in which a\ncustomer is handled before, during and after the sales transaction (of either a tangible\nproduct or a service)\u2014has been researched from both the operations management and\nmarketing perspectives. Many papers and books have been published on this area,\ndescribing for example the differences between the marketing of services and products\n(e.g. Payne, 1993). Another highly researched area is the perceived quality of the\nservice received by the customer, including the many studies using the well-known\n\u201cGap Model\u201d (Zeithaml and Bitner, 1996). The streams of research into customer\nservice are well established. In contrast, customer support\u2014a specific type of\ncustomer service offered by manufacturers\u2014has not been as highly researched.\nHowever, customer support is now \u201cbeing recognised as an important research\npriority\u201d (Loomba, 1996).\nThe majority of what has been written about customer support has been\npublished for practitioners. Examples are journals, such as AFSM International\u2014The\nProfessional Journal, (the publication of a professional association for customer support\nmanagers), and books (e.g. Wellemin, 1984; Patton, 1984; Laub and Khandphur, 1996). An\nextensive review of the practitioner literature identified seven elements of support (Goffin,\n1999).\n6The Elements of Customer Support\nThe seven key elements of customer support are:\n\uf0b7 Installation. For many products, the first element of product support following the\nsale is installation. For complex products, or where safety issues are involved,\npersonnel from the manufacturing company, or their representatives usually\nperform this.\n\uf0b7 User Training. The complexity of some types of equipment means that\nmanufacturers must provide good training for users. For example, the successful\nimplementation of new manufacturing equipment often depends on extensive\ntraining (Athaide et al, 1996). Many products include functions, which help users\nlearn to use them more efficiently; these can range from simple Help functions, to\nfull computer training packages.\n\uf0b7 Documentation. Most products require some form of documentation. Typical forms\nof documentation cover equipment operation, installation, maintenance and repair.\nGood documentation can reduce support costs (Miskie, 1989).\n\uf0b7 Maintenance and Repair. Historically, this has always been an important element\nof customer support. Maintenance, is necessary to clean, refurbish or replace parts\nof equipment which otherwise would be liable to fail. If equipment fails, fast and\nefficient repair is essential in many markets because \u201cdown-time costs run typically\nat anywhere from 100 to 10,000 times the price of spare parts or service\u201d (Knecht\net al, 1993). Manufacturers need to have effective logistics for the management of\ncustomer support engineers and the movement of spares, the parts used in repairs.\n7\uf0b7 On-Line Support. Telephone advice on products is important in many industries.\nProduct experts give on-line consulting to customers to help them use products\nmore efficiently or, sometimes to trace the cause of faults.\n\uf0b7 Warranty. Manufacturers\u2019 warranties reduce the financial risk of owning products.\nOver the working lifetime of a product, support costs can be high and so many\nmanufacturers offer customers the possibility to purchase extended warranty.\n\uf0b7 Upgrades. Customers may be offered the opportunity to enhance the performance\nof existing products. For example, computer upgrades increase the working\nlifetimes of products.\nOver the last fifteen years there has been a change in the relative importance of\ndifferent elements of customer support. In the past, when many products had high\nfailure rates, the most important aspect of support was fast and reliable repair (Lele\nand Karmarker, 1983). New technologies have now typically led to more reliable\nproducts. However, increased product complexity (which is often software-based)\nmeans that the importance of user training and on-line support has increased (Goffin,\n1998).\nPrevious Publications and Research\nTable I shows that there are five aspects of the management of customer support on\nwhich papers and books have been published. Customer support strategy consist of\nwritings on how support contributes both to the competitive advantage of companies,\nthe achievement of customer satisfaction and the generation of revenues\u2014there is\noften a difficult balance to be achieved between the latter two points. In recent years\n8there has been increasing recognition of the strategic importance of customer support\nto manufacturers (Knecht et al, 1993).\nInsert Table 1\nA key aspect of support is the management of the field support organisation\u2014\nincluding the engineers who install and maintain equipment. Much has been written\nfor practitioners on how to approach this and there has been some academic research\ninto best practices (e.g. Hull and Cox, 1994). Just as the management of engineers is\nimportant, so is the logistics of spare parts. Inventory levels for spare parts are\ndifficult to control and, for example, research has shown that the approaches used for\nstock control in manufacturing situations do not apply to spare parts (Fourtin and\nMartin, 1999).\nTwo emerging areas should also be mentioned. Customer support\norganisations have extensive knowledge of customers\u2019 requirements and this\ninformation is now being recognised as invaluable for marketing. However, little has\nbeen published on this area yet. Similarly, the relationship between new product\ndevelopment and customer support has been discussed by a number of authors but is\nnot well understood.\nCustomer Support and NPD\nSupport revenues may be a significant source of income for manufacturers but for\ncustomers the cost of maintaining equipment over its working lifetime\u2014referred to as\ncost-of-ownership (Taylor, 1995)\u2014can be prohibitive. Therefore, customers in many\nsectors are demanding more economical and effective customer support (Loomba,\n1996). A key factor which influences the efficiency and economics of customer\n9support is product design (Lele, 1986). However, the need to consider customer\nsupport during NPD has been largely ignored by both companies and researchers\n(Goffin, 1998).\nA number of authors have recognised the importance of support requirements\nbeing considered at the design stage (e.g. Cespedes, 1995; Armistead and Clark, 1992;\nBerg and Loeb, 1990; Goffin, 1998). Product design influences both the amount of\nsupport necessary and the means by which it can be delivered (Garvin, 1988; Sleeter,\n1991). For example, decisions taken at the design stage affect product reliability and\nconsequently how often products require maintenance and repair (Lele, 1986).\nSimilarly, a modular approach to product design can reduce repair costs (Hedge and\nKubat, 1989), as can good diagnostics (Armistead and Clark, 1992; Karmarker and\nKubat, 1987). However, beyond repair and maintenance, product design also\ninfluences the amount of user training which is necessary and the ease of upgrading\nproducts. Appropriate product design can therefore significantly reduce cost-of-\nownership (Blanchard, 1991). For example, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 95 product was\n\u201cspecifically designed to reduce total cost of ownership through increased ease of use,\nfunctionality and support\u201d (Taylor, 1995). Products that have been consciously\ndesigned for easy customer support have a strong differentiating factor in the market\n(Swink, et al 1996).\nIt is important to not only consider customer support requirements early in\nNPD but also to make a comprehensive evaluation. The early evaluation of all aspects\nof product support at the design stage has been termed Design for Supportability\n(DFS-II) by Goffin (1998). To achieve this, it has been recognised that engineers with\nexperience of customer support should be involved in product development (Hull and\n10\nCox, 1994), as \u201cby participating in the development stage, the after-sales group can\nadd substantial value by making the equipment more \u2018maintenance-friendly\u2019\u201d (Knecht\net al, 1993). However, a survey showed that customer support personnel were only\n\u201coccasionally involved in new product work\u201d (Page, 1993). In addition, research has\nshown that many companies do not consider product support until relatively late in the\ndevelopment cycle (Goffin, 1990). Low involvement of customer support personnel in\nNPD can lead to products that are difficult to repair and which have excessive\nwarranty and service costs (Anthoney and McKay, 1992).\nDesign for Supportability Practices\nAlthough the need to evaluate support requirements is recognised, information on how\nthis should be done is sparse\u2014only four articles discuss this aspect of NPD in detail\n(see Table II).\nInsert Table II\nLivingston describes how Rank-Xerox recognised that low cost-of-ownership is\nimportant to customers and that it can be minimised by reducing the cost of every\naspect of support (Livingston, 1988). This recognition led to the adoption of a range of\nsupportability goals including ease-of-use, ease-of-cleaning, easier maintenance\nprocedures, and ease-of-repair. Rank-Xerox found that it was necessary to have a clear\nprocess for setting design priorities, as different functional departments may have\nopposing objectives. For example, manufacturing\u2019s objective may be to reduce\nassembly costs. This can lead to a product that is easy to manufacture but hard for\nengineers to repair at customer sites. A limitation of Livingston\u2019s article is that\nspecific examples of the service\/support goals are not given.\n11\nTeresko (1994) discusses serviceability (ease of product maintenance and\nrepair) and product design, suggesting that \u201ca new design idea is surfacing in the\nmarket battle for product supremacy: serviceability\u201d. A computer-aided design (CAD)\ntool is described which calculates field disassembly and re-assembly times and\nidentifies service costs (Parker, 1993; Teresko, 1994). This package is based on earlier\nsoftware used to ensure that products are easy to manufacture. The apparent limitation\nof the software is that it focuses on maintenance and repairs and ignores other\nimportant elements of customer support, such as user training, documentation, etc.\nHull and Cox (1994) conducted case study research at six leading electronics\nmanufacturers. They focused mainly on field support organisations but also identified\nthe importance of customer support engineers giving inputs to the NPD process. For\nexample at National Cash Register (NCR), an information processing company,\n\u201cmaintainability and serviceability of products are a prime consideration in the design\nand manufacturing processes\u201d. Similar approaches were found at International\nBusiness Machines (IBM); Hewlett-Packard; General Electric (GE); and Amdahl (data\nprocessing systems). At American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) \u201cproducts are\ndesigned for serviceability and [good] after-sales support is acknowledged as a\nprerequisite for product sales\u201d. Although they clearly identified that leading\nelectronics companies consider support at the design stage by involving service\nengineers, Hull and Cox gave no information on how support is evaluated during\nNPD.\nPrevious research on hospital equipment (Goffin, 1998), identified three main\npoints. Firstly, support requirements are typically not considered early enough during\nNPD. Secondly, support may have to \u201ccompete\u201d for resources with issues such as\n12\nproduct features during NPD and so a clear understanding of the cost of support over\nthe working lifetime of a product is required. Thirdly, it is important to provide\nquantitative design goals to R&D, related to each of the key support requirements. The\nmain limitation of this research is that it only describes the approach taken at one\ncompany in detail.\nThe need for evaluating customer support during NPD is clear but previous\nresearch had the limitations, which were discussed. Therefore, the following research\nquestions were identified:\n1) What are the key elements of customer support in different industries? How are\nthese related to the characteristics of typical products?\n2) Is customer support important for both simple and complex products?\n3) How do companies evaluate support requirements during new product\ndevelopment?\nOverall, the investigation of NPD formed part of a wider study of customer support,\nwhich has been described previously (Goffin, 1999).\nMETHODLOGY\nResearch Design\nAs shown by the literature review, there has been only limited previous investigation\nof how customer support issues are evaluated during NPD. Therefore, the research\nwas exploratory in nature and a suitable approach was required.\nA postal survey of the issues was considered but rejected. Postal surveys have\na number of limitations, including the possible ambiguity of questions, the lack of\ncontrol over who actually answers the questionnaire and potentially low response rates\n(Moser and Kalton, 1971). Due to the complexity of some of the concepts of customer\n13\nsupport and their emerging nature, the possibility of ambiguous answers was\nconsidered to be high. Similarly, response rates for surveys in the field of customer\nsupport have previously been low (Goffin, 1998). Therefore, a case study approach\nwas selected as an appropriate way to address the problems of non-response and\nambiguous answers. However, in choosing case study methodology, the researchers\nrecognised that the design needed to be carefully constructed to ensure sufficient\nrigour.\nThere are many issues to consider in achieving high-quality case study design\nbut the main ones are construct validity and internal validity (Yin, 1994; Easton, 1995;\nMiles and Huberman, 1994). Construct validity refers to establishing suitable\noperational measures for the concepts being studied (Mason and Bramble, 1989). This\nwas largely achieved by basing the questionnaire used for data collection on the work\nof previous researchers and sufficient piloting. Consequently, operational measures\nsuch as the percentage of revenues from customer support were identified from\nprevious research. Internal validity refers to the reliability of a study and whether the\nvariables chosen for investigation are sufficient to explain the topic under\ninvestigation (Dane, 1990). In order to maximise internal validity, multiple sources of\ndata were used. For example, triangulation was used with informants\u2019 views being\nchecked against company documentation where possible. Lincoln and Guba (1985)\nhave identified observer bias as being a potentially real threat to reliable interpretation.\nTo counter observer bias, \u201cmember checks\u201d\u2014feedback from informants\u2014were used\nas the key method for establishing the credibility of an interpretation (Wallendorf and\nBelk, 1989). To achieve a rigorous case study design, the research was designed in\nfour stages:\n14\n\uf0b7 Preliminary contacts. Leading companies in different industries were identified\nand contacted by letter. Their agreement to participate in the research was obtained\nand the manager responsible for customer support identified. At this point\ntelephone calls were made to the customer support managers at each company to:\nexplain the research aims; obtain a preliminary understanding of the role of\ncustomer support; set a date for a visit; and to identify the most suitable informants.\n\uf0b7 Case study visits. One-day visits were made to the companies to conduct semi-\nstructured interviews with the customer support manager and other informants,\nsuch as marketing and quality managers. During these visits the researcher also had\nthe opportunity to inspect documentation and to view the company\u2019s products.\n\uf0b7 Data analysis and post-visit contacts. After each visit, preliminary analysis and\ndata reduction was conducted and, following the completion of all five visits,\ncross-case analysis was performed. There was also a high degree of involvement of\nthe companies during this stage, in checking case descriptions and discussing the\nresults with the researcher.\n\uf0b7 Workshop with participating companies. The final stage of the research was a one-\nday workshop held with managers from the participating companies. This gave\nparticipating managers the opportunity to discuss the results of the cross-case\nanalysis and best practices with managers from different sectors. At this workshop,\nthe researchers obtained extensive feedback from managers.\nExploratory Sample\nFrom the onset of the research it was clear that a single case study would not be\nsufficient. In exploratory studies single case are only appropriate if they are unique,\nextreme or revelatory (Yin, 1994). Therefore, five industries were selected as an\n15\nexploratory sample for the research. As the computer industry had been investigated\npreviously (see Table II), it was decided to extend knowledge by focusing on sectors,\nwhich had not been studied before. Therefore, telecommunications, the car industry,\nvending machines, aircraft and domestic appliances were chosen\u2014a purposive choice\nof industries. The choice was driven by the need to cover a variety of case study\ncontexts. Therefore both a deliberately wide range of sectors (including both\nconsumer and business-to-business products) and technologies (from electronics to\nmechanical devices) were included.\nOnce the industries had been chosen, \u201cleading\u201d companies were identified\u2014\ncompanies having a significant market share in their industry. All of the sample\ncompanies have operations in Europe. As a motivation to participate in the research,\ncompanies were promised an informal \u201cbenchmarking report\u201d, contrasting their\napproach evaluating customer support during NPD to that of other companies. This\noffer was well received and only one company declined to co-operate with the\nresearch (forcing the selection of another company). In addition, participating\ncompanies were also told they would be invited to a workshop where the results of the\nresearch would be presented and discussed with the other companies.\nStructure of Case Study Visits\nThe main data collection was performed during visits to the companies. These were\nmade over a period of seven months in 1997-98. During each visit, semi-structured\ninterviews were held with a range of informants. Holding on-site interviews at\ncompanies with personnel from various departments\u2014typically customer support,\nmarketing, quality, and development (see Table III)\u2014allowed a comprehensive\n16\npicture of the role of customer support within the company to be obtained. Multiple\ninformants also allowed data triangulation\u2014an important approach to ensuring data\nreliability in manager-reported research (Miles and Huberman, 1994).\nThe interviews at each company were based on a questionnaire designed to\ncollect information on each of the following areas:\n\uf0b7 What are the characteristics of the company\u2019s typical products?\n\uf0b7 What is the role of customer support in the company\u2019s market?\n\uf0b7 What are the key elements of the customer support they offer to their customers?\n\uf0b7 How are customer support requirements evaluated during new product\ndevelopment?\n- At what stage of NPD are requirements considered?\n- Which departments are responsible for evaluating support?\n- Are design goals set for support requirements?\nEvery interview was recorded (and later transcribed) and at the same time detailed\nnotes were taken. Interview transcripts were prepared and footnotes added to explain\nany specific terms used by the respondents. Marginal notes were used to identify both\nkey issues and areas where further clarification was required (this was obtained in the\npost-visit telephone calls). In addition to direct discussions, a number of telephone\ninterviews were held with personnel who were not available during the on-site visits\nbut interviewees had recommended the researcher to contact.\nWhere possible, a range of company documentation was inspected during the\nvisits including:\n17\n\uf0b7 Company brochures and annual reports (for background information)\n\uf0b7 Product brochures (to understand product features and to see whether customer\nsupport was used as a marketing tool)\n\uf0b7 Financial statements (to investigate support revenues)\n\uf0b7 Organisation charts (to see where customer support fitted in the structure of the\ncompany)\n\uf0b7 Most importantly, documentation of how the evaluation of customer support fits\ninto new product development.\nCompanies were willing to give the researcher copies of most of these documents but,\nin the case of financial statements and (sometimes) organisation charts, they only\nallowed inspection. After each visit a detailed case file was prepared containing the\ntranscripts, interview notes and copies of documents.\nQuestionnaire Design\nThe 11-page questionnaire was based on the instruments developed by researchers\nwho have previously investigated customer support; primarily the work of Goffin,\n(1990), Hull and Cox (1994); Knecht et al (1993); and Loomba (1996). Questions\nwere incorporated on the importance of support; its key elements; product\ncharacteristics; and customer support and NPD. Due to the emergent nature of some of\nthe issues involved, many of the questions were open-ended. [A copy of the\nquestionnaire is available on request from the authors.]\nData Analysis\nCase analysis was conducted in four main stages, which follows the recommendations\nof Miles and Huberman (1994):\n18\n\uf0b7 Each case was reviewed separately and the data analysed to give a complete picture\nof the company\u2019s approach to evaluating support at the design stage. The same data\nanalysis framework was used for each case. To check the internal validity of the\ndata, triangulation was used; between different respondents and between\nrespondents\u2019 comments and copies of company documentation.\n\uf0b7 Data reduction was performed and 2-3 page case descriptions were written on each\ncompany. A number of main headings were used for data presentation including\nProduct Characteristics; Key Elements of Customer Support; The Importance of\nCustomer Support; and Customer Support and NPD. The descriptions were then\nsubmitted to informants for two reasons. Firstly, informants checked that the case\ndescriptions did not contain obvious clues to their company\u2019s identity or\ninformation that was likely to compromise their business. Secondly, informants\nchecked the detail given in the case description\u2014and a number of small corrections\nwere made.\n\uf0b7 Following this, cross-case comparisons were made, to determine where similarities\nand differences existed and to identify a number of \u201cbest practices\u201d (Yin, 1994).\n\uf0b7 As the results of the cross-case analysis were presented to participating companies\nduring the workshop mentioned above, this allowed the conclusions to be discussed\nwith the informants. The transcript of the recording of the workshop was also\nuseful in this stage of the analysis.\nRESULTS: FIVE CASE STUDIES\nAs the companies were promised anonymity, they will be referred to as TelecommA,\nAutoB, VendorC, AeroD and DomesticE. Information on each of these companies is\n19\ngiven in Table III, including company backgrounds, the informants interviewed and\nthe key findings. In order to concentrate on the main results of the study, only short\ndescriptions of each of the companies will be given (further within-case background\ninformation can be found in Goffin, 1999). This paper focuses on the cross-case\nanalysis of the key elements of support and the way support is evaluated during NPD.\nInsert Table III\nCompany and Product Overviews\nTelecommA is a small company of 150 employees but they are the European leaders\nin the field of telecommunications systems. They design, integrate and support\ncomplex systems used in logistics applications, such as radio contact and control of\nfleets of vehicles. Systems consist of a central computer linked to devices such as\nPCs, sensors and radio equipment, with specialised software monitoring and\ncontrolling the resulting network. Each system sold has a unique configuration and\ncosts are typically in the region of $1M. Customers\u2014normally logistics companies\nand organisations\u2014typically use their systems for up to 20 years and they are\nincreasingly demanding more cost-effective support from TelecommA. Currently\ncustomer support, which is provided by the R&D group from the factory, only\ngenerates 4% of revenues but at margins, which are higher than those from product\nsales.\nAutoB is a major international manufacturer of passenger cars, which has\nthousands of employees in its various organisations worldwide. They design,\nmanufacture and market cars and their products are produced in very high volumes.\nThrough their chain of dealers, they service cars in most countries A typical vehicle\n20\nproduced by AutoB costs $15,000 and has a 10-12 year working lifetime, during\nwhich it will have a number of owners. Although customer support only accounts for\n15% of AutoB\u2019s revenues, they acknowledge that it has a strong influence over\nwhether customers make repeat purchases\u2014the importance of customer support in the\nautomotive market has also been recognised by researchers (e.g. Goffin, 1999).\nVendorC designs, manufactures, sells and supports complex vending machines\nand are the market leader. They employ several thousand people in their development,\nmanufacturing and service organisations worldwide. Vending companies buy large\nnumbers of machines to provide self-service sales of a wide range of goods, some of\nhigh value. Modern vending machines\u2014often referred to as vending terminals\u2014are a\ncomplex mix of mechanical, electronic, security and display technologies and a top\nrange model can cost in the region of $15,000. The machines have a working lifetime\nof about 10 years during which regular maintenance is required. Customer support is\nessential to VendorC, as correctly functioning equipment prevents loss of sales for\nvending companies. In addition, VendorC make over a third of their revenues form\ncustomer support activities and top management has focused significant resources on\nthis area since recognising that good support can \u201cdramatically improve...\n[customers\u2019] business performance\u201d [VendorC\u2014Quality Manager].\nAeroD designs, manufactures, sells and supports small passenger aircraft\u2014\ntermed regional aircraft in the industry. They have several thousand employees,\nincluding significant numbers in development and production. Regional aircraft is a\nvery competitive industry and margins are often low because the cost of materials and\nvendor components can exceed 65% of sales price. Aircraft typically cost between\n$6M and $12M, depending on their size and configuration. Individual aircraft have a\n21\nworking lifetime of at least 20 years and support consequently accounts for 20% of\ncompany revenues. Since \u201cthe in-service performance of aircraft, in terms of flight\nsafety and reliability, is paramount\u201d [AeroD\u2014Engineering Manager], customer\nsupport is a key part of the business.\nDomesticE, which is based in continental Europe, designs, manufactures, sells\nand maintains \u201cwhite goods\u201d\u2014domestic appliances, such as washing machines. They\nhave several thousand employees and operate in a highly competitive, price-sensitive\nmarket\u2014shown by the fact that despite having a strong brand, DomesticE have not\nbeen able to increase their prices for the last ten years. Modern washing machines are\na mix of mechanical, electro-mechanical and, increasingly, electronic components and\na typical model will cost in the region of $300. Machines have a working lifetime of\nabout 10 years in normal usage. Strategically, support is \u201ca major strength and a\ncompetitive advantage\u201d and a key source of profit for DomesticE. The company\nstrongly promotes its customer support in all its sales and marketing activities\u2014 \u201cour\nextensive After-Sales Service ensures each product produces a market-leading\nperformance from day one onwards\u201d (extract from a promotional brochure).\nKey Elements of Customer Support\nFrom the trade literature, seven elements of customer support were identified. The\ncase study research showed that not all of the seven elements are of importance to\nevery company and identified an eighth element which applies to some companies\u2014\nTable III gives the key elements for each of the companies.\nThe simplest products studied were the appliances of DomesticE, for which\nfour elements of customer support are key. Installation is simple and a not particularly\nimportant aspect of customer support. In the majority of cases the customer installs the\n22\nmachine, or independently arranges for it to be carried out by a local tradesman.\nHowever, simple and effective documentation is important because users seldom have\nmuch technical knowledge. DomesticE have recognised this and try to produce user\ndocumentation covering installation, operation and simple fault-finding which is\ndeliberately written in a style that is accessible to typical users. Washing machines\nused to need preventive maintenance, for example replacement of the brushes on\nelectric motors. However, maintenance has now been \u201cengineered out of products by\ndesigning them for the whole life cycle\u201d [DomesticE\u2014Process Manager] and service\nengineers are not required unless a product fails. Quick response in the event of\nbreakdowns is essential in this market and DomesticE have their own, long-\nestablished and extensive service organisation, assisted by call centres which try to\nsolve problems over the telephone. Product warranty is important to DomesticE\u2014one\nyear is the industry norm but they differentiate themselves by offering the customer\nbetter terms.\nIn strong contrast to domestic appliances, the most complex products in the\nsample were aircraft and every element of customer support was both relevant and\nimportant for the manufacturer AeroD. This company delivers aircraft to their\ncustomers and conduct training of airline personnel, which is one of the most time-\nconsuming aspects of support\u2014both induction and refresher courses for airlines\u2019\npilots and maintenance engineers are run on a regular basis. As might be expected in a\nhighly regulated industry, high quality documentation is essential and, in some cases,\nthis must be approved. Key documentation includes the flight manual, which contains\nall the information that the pilot needs to operate the aircraft safely; and maintenance\nmanuals. Depending on the level of usage (i.e. flying hours), a significant amount of\n23\nmaintenance is required\u2014something under 3 maintenance hours per flying hour is\ntypical in the industry. AeroD sells spare parts to airlines for repair and maintenance\npurposes and they have a large call centre to give advice on maintenance issues.\nWarranty cover is comprehensive and generally specified for each major component\nof the aircraft. For example, engine and structural warranty are separately specified, in\ncycles (e.g. the number of take-offs and landings) or flying hours. Upgrading aircraft\nis also a significant business for AeroD. A key aspect of AeroD\u2019s strategy is their\nengineering support\u2014advice to airlines on how best to manage their aircraft\u2014which\ngoes beyond the scope of support provided by response centres. Engineering support\nis provided without charge to major customers and helps increase aircraft reliability\nand prevent flight cancellations (which can lead to a major loss of revenues for\nairlines). \u201cWe [the manufacturer] can offer to examine the customer\u2019s operation and\nprovide advice on how he can get the best from the product. This can be technical,\noperational or commercial advice\u201d [AeroD\u2014Customer Service Manager].\nIn terms of complexity, the products of the three other sample companies lie in\ndifferent positions between the extremes, with cars and vending machines both being\nmore complex than domestic appliances but simpler than telecommunications systems\nand aircraft. In the automotive industry product support is generally referred to as\nservice and the four main elements are maintenance and repair including parts;\ndocumentation (workshop and owner manuals); the training of mechanics from\nrecognised dealerships; and warranty. Due to their mechanical parts, cars require a\nsignificant amount of maintenance and repair and this increases cost-of-ownership.\nStocking and distributing spare parts is a major business for AutoB. Warranty is\n24\nnormally 12 months, although competitive pressure is changing this to 3 years in some\ncountries.\nVendorC manage all aspects of installation, from site surveying, to wiring and\nfitting. Training of the staff of vending companies who are responsible for first-line\nmaintenance and replenishing machines plays a key role. Terminals have full technical\ndocumentation for maintenance purposes and some of this is being made available\nover the Internet. Timely maintenance and repair is very important as equipment\ndowntime leads to lost sales. Consequently VendorC has invested heavily in\nestablishing an effective support organisation. Warranties are 90 days\u2014standard in\nthis industry. In addition, VendorC sell upgrades on \u201cused terminals to extend\nequipment lifetime\u201d [VendorC brochure]. VendorC have the capability to offer full\ngoods management to their customers\u2014ensuring that machines are working and are\nreplenished in a timely fashion. This new service is now an important source of\nrevenue for VendorC and arose from customer feedback obtained by the field service\nfunction.\nTelecommA\u2019s systems are complex and require extensive support, although\nthe company has not focused on developing this side of the business. R&D engineers\ninstall systems and this typically takes 9 days. Systems are designed for ease of use but\nusers still require training\u2014typically one day following installation (TelecommA\n\u201cspend very little time on training, we do try to pass that on to the customer\u201d\n[TelecommA\u2014Development Manager]). Hardware is very reliable and failure rates\nare typically only 1%. However, due to the complexity of networks, software\nproblems may occur and require investigation. System documentation is produced by\nR&D engineers and some customers are now requesting comprehensive\n25\ndocumentation for their own use in first-line maintenance. All systems are sold with a\n12 months hardware warranty and 3 months software warranty, which is standard in\nthis industry. Upgrades, which enhance system capability, are a significant business\nfor TelecommA and systems typically have a major upgrade every 2 years.\nAcross the sample of companies studied, it can be seen that different products\nhave different key elements of customer support. Generally, more complex products\nrequire more aspects of customer support. It is the evaluation of the relevant aspects of\ncustomer support at the design stage that potentially can make support easier and more\ncost-effective.\nNew Product Development and Customer Support\nAlthough customer support plays an important role for all of the companies, there was\na wide variation in the approaches taken to integrating it into NPD. A key issue that\nemerged from the research was how \u201ccomprehensive\u201d the evaluation of customer\nsupport requirements at the design stage is. For example, are all relevant elements\nconsidered early in the design cycle and are suitable design goals set for each of them?\nIn this section of the analysis, the case results will be presented starting with the\nsimplest approach to evaluating customer support during NPD.\nThe least comprehensive approach to the evaluation of customer support needs\nat the design stage was at TelecommA\u2014as might be expected at a small company. For\nthem, NPD involves taking a \u201ccore\u201d computer system and integrating it with other\ndevices to match specific customer needs and developing suitable software. The\ndesign of a system typically takes 6 months. Support issues are considered from the\ndesign stage but in an informal way: \u201cour whole design ethos is to make it as simple to\n26\nmaintain and support as possible. There\u2019s no formal documentation [on customer\nsupport requirements]\u201d [Quality Manager]. TelecommA have no product support plan\n[a document that summarises the key issues of customer support for a particular\nproduct, which is common in the computer industry]. Many of TelecommA\u2019s R&D\nengineers have had experience of supporting previous systems in the field and are\naware of customer support issues. However, no formal product design goals are set on\nany issues related to supportability. Consequently, there are currently no goals at\nTelecommA to reduce installation times, simplify training or minimise upgrade times\nand therefore reduce costs on new products.\nDomesticE\u2019s product life cycles are normally 12 years but models \u201cundergo a\nconstant evolution of cosmetic and other design improvements over the life cycle\u201d\n[NPD Process Manager]. New appliances are developed typically over 30 months by a\ncross-functional team including R&D, marketing, manufacturing, and suppliers.\nProduct requirements are comprehensively documented at the design stage and a\nnumber of formal tools, such as Quality Function Development (QFD) and Design for\nAssembly (DFA), are used to help guide design decisions. Representatives from the\nservice organisation have always been invited to give their inputs on new designs and\nprototypes. However, DomesticE are concerned that this has not worked efficiently\u2014\n\u201cwe still need to get more service involvement and to have them take a more active\npart in the formal review process\u201d [DomesticE\u2014Process Manager]. Due to the\nnumber of mechanical components they contain, washing machines are susceptible to\nfailure and the average failure rate is 25% for a machine in its first year of usage.\nConsequently, the analysis of customer support issues at the design stage focuses on\ntwo points\u2014product reliability and ease of repair. For both of these, quantitative goals\n27\nare set at the design stage. However, no model of total lifetime service costs is\ncurrently used. DomesticE now face a number of challenges including the need to\nimprove product reliability and ensuring that new, more complex products are easier\nto use.\nAlthough their products are complex, AeroD do not set as many support-\nrelated design goals as, for example AutoB or VendorC. During development, the\nAeroD project team takes into account the requirements of a range of users making up\nwhat is called the Advisory Group; this includes pilots, cabin personnel, airlines\u2019\nfinancial representatives and maintenance engineers. Accounting for the requirements\nof these different parties is not simple and the design group has to make decisions on\nthe best solution to complex and sometimes opposing requirements. \u201cOne of the\nconcerns is to make the aircraft cheaper to maintain\u201d [AeroD\u2014Design Manager] and\na Maintenance Steering Group is used to identify the key requirements of\nmaintenance personnel. They determine \u201csome top level goals, like maintenance hours\nper flying hour\u201d [AeroD\u2014Design Manager] but not all aspects of support are\ncurrently evaluated in detail or have associated quantitative design goals. \u201cI think its\nfair to say that many of these types of issues [design for easy maintenance] were again\ndown to the experience of the team who were working on the job and the guidance of\nthe more senior managers\u201d [AeroD\u2014Customer Service Manager]. With the high level\nof bought-in components, AeroD also have the issue that some aspects of maintenance\nare strongly influenced by their suppliers. Support has always been considered during\nNPD by the experienced design team but AeroD are now trying to improve this\nevaluation by determining a more comprehensive range of maintenance-related design\ngoals.\n28\nSince three years, AutoB has had a specific organisation of 30 people with the\nresponsibility for ensuring that customer support issues are adequately considered\nduring NPD. Their charter \u201cis to participate early and pro-actively in the new model\ndevelopment process and to represent customer services division in design decisions\u201d.\n[AutoB\u2014Advanced Service Manager]. This is important because cost-of-ownership is\na key factor in business-to-business sales, as fleet managers are acutely aware of\nvehicle running costs (comparisons of these are often published in trade journals). As\na consequence, AutoB conducts a detailed analysis of the way every new product will\nbe serviced. The product design goals which are set include cost-of-ownership;\nserviceability; and maintenance. In addition, a check is made of whether new cars\nsolve prior model concerns and address damageability issues adequately. The latter is\nan assessment of how the cost of repairing the inevitable damage that will occur in\ncommon accidents can be minimised. The results of the analyses are summarised in a\ndocument called the Cost of Ownership\/Serviceability\/Damageability Plan, which\nassesses the five issues mentioned, for each and every major component in a car (an\nexample copy of this plan was given to the researchers). As a consequence, design\ngoals are set for both AutoB\u2019s development teams and suppliers. To convince the\nvarious departments involved in NPD to give suitable priority to service-related\nissues, a financial model is also used. This can \u201cdemonstrate the wisdom of reducing\ncost-of-ownership and look at the effect of poor repair capability on customer\nsatisfaction... trying to put a dollar figure on it\u201d [AutoB\u2014Advanced Service\nManager]. For the future, AutoB say they need to reduce cost-of-ownership further\nand are looking closely at the performance of their competitors in this area.\n29\nOf the five companies studied, VendorC make the most comprehensive\nevaluation of customer support at the design stage. Their NPD team is cross-\nfunctional and includes R&D, product management, manufacturing, suppliers and\nproduct support specialists. Their work is co-ordinated by a seven stage Phase Review\nplan, which specifies the key responsibilities of each department at each stage of NPD.\nOver the last five years, a strong focus on product support by management has led to\nthe consideration of service issues being \u201cpushed further back into the design\u201d,\nthrough the direct involvement of customer support specialists [VendorC\u2014Field\nService Engineer]. Consequently, the preparation of a Product & Solutions Services\nPlanning document which summarises these issues is now an integral part of NPD. At\nthe design stage product support specialists analyse the RASUI of products\u2014the\nreliability; availability; serviceability; usability; and installability. For each of these\nfive categories a detailed analysis is performed, and clear design goals are set. The\nQuality Department has the overall responsibility of ensuring that RASUI goals are\nmet. In order to meet their challenging maintenance goals, VendorC have adopted a\nvariety of approaches. These include modular design, for quick replacement of faulty\nor worn components, is standard practice and \u201cdiagnostic capability is designed into\neach individual element of terminals\u201d [VendorC\u2014Quality Assurance Engineer].\nSeveral of the benefits to customers of the RASUI evaluation are clearly identified in\nproduct brochures. The performance of their installed base of vending machines is\nvery closely monitored by VendorC\u2019s elaborate internet-based system, which collates\ndata on all aspects of field service. Product reliability (e.g. downtime by product; by\nlocation; by cause; etc.) and service engineer efficiency (installation times; percentage\nfirst-time-fixes; etc.) are just two of the metrics which are reported daily by the field\n30\norganisation. Comprehensive data have been found crucial for early recognition of\nproduct problems and in setting design goals for new products.\nDISCUSSION\nThe cases cover five very different markets but it can be seen that customer support\nplays an important role in each of them\u2014managers identified that good product\nsupport plays a key role in both creating a competitive advantage and, in most cases,\ngenerating significant revenues. However, the cross-case analysis identified some key\ndifferences in:\n\uf0b7 The elements of customer support which are important for particular types of\nproducts and\n\uf0b7 How comprehensively companies evaluate customer support requirements at the\ndesign stage.\nThe nature and reliability of equipment obviously has a large influence over\nthe key elements of product support. In the two companies where products have a\nlarge number of mechanical components, products require higher levels of\nmaintenance. In the telecommunications industry hardware maintenance is less of an\nissue but in all five markets customers expect reliable products and quick response in\nthe event of failure. Equipment retrofits or upgrades are an important element of\ncustomer support in three industries: telecommunications, vending machines and\naircraft. Currently they are not important in the car industry but it remains to be seen\nwhether this will change as more electronics systems are used in cars (a technology\nthat lends itself to comparatively easy upgrades). Both VendorC and AeroD offer their\ncustomers an extra support service\u2014goods management and engineering support\n31\nrespectively. These services are more complex than the normal advice offered by call\ncentres and appear to give a competitive advantage to the respective manufacturers.\nFurther investigation is, however, required on the link between these new types of\ncustomer support and competitive advantage.\nThe degree with which customer support issues are evaluated at the design\nstage varied across the five companies. TelecommA, probably because of its small\nsize, has the least formal approach. Although R&D engineers are used as a resource\nfor field service and therefore often have first-hand knowledge of the problems, it\nappears that TelecommA could benefit from a more structured approach. For example,\nthey have not set design goals to reduce installation times (and costs) from current\nlevels. DomesticE and AeroD evaluate support at the design stage but do not use a full\nrange of quantitative goals and both companies are not satisfied with the degree to\nwhich support requirements are input to their NPD programmes. They feel that too\nmuch still depends on whether R&D engineers have the experience to know how to\ndesign products which are easy to support. In contrast, both AutoB and VendorC make\na comprehensive evaluation of every aspect of support and set design goals related to\neach of them. In addition, the supportability of previous generations of products is\nused as a benchmark\u2014both companies want the customer support of each new\nproduct to be more efficient. VendorC\u2019s RASUI evaluation and tracking of a wide\nrange of field service data appears to be useful mechanisms for ensuring that the needs\nof customer support are fully integrated into NPD. The strong support of top\nmanagement the customer support function at VendorC is also acknowledged as being\ninstrumental in their success.\n32\nFrom both the literature and the current study, the concept emerged of a\ncomprehensive evaluation of customer support requirements at the design stage. The\ncase companies appeared to have reached different levels of sophistication in this area.\nAlthough strict historical data on when the companies enhanced their approaches were\nnot collected, discussions with informants indicated that this had taken some time\u2014\nfor example AutoB had assigned a specific group to the task for the last three years\nbut still saw room for improvement. Reviewing the data on each of the case\ncompanies allowed a conceptual model, Figure 1, to be drawn. This illustrates the\ndegree to which the companies evaluate support and how, over time, increased\nemphasis is put on this area.\nInsert Figure 1\nInitially, customer support requirements may not be recognised as important.\nCompanies at Stage 1 do not recognise the potential of support business. And\nconsequently do not evaluate it at the design stage. Poor product design means higher\nrepair costs and can lead to dissatisfied customers. At Stage 2, companies consider\nreliability and repair times at the design stage and typically set quantitative goals for\nproduct reliability (mean-time-between-failures, MTBF) and ease-of-repair (mean-\ntime-to-repair, MTTR). However, broader aspects of support are not considered at the\ndesign stage. Further progression leads to Stage 3, where companies involve panels of\nfield engineers in NPD reviews. It is essential to evaluate all aspects of support at the\ndesign stage i.e. installation times; fault diagnosis times; field access times; repair\ntimes\/costs, user training times; upgrade times; etc. Integrating this effectively into the\nNPD process may be difficult and so it may take companies a long time to reach Stage\n33\n4. At Stage 4 companies set quantitative goals at the design stage for all relevant\naspects of support and use lifetime cost models. These goals push development\nengineers to develop designs that are easier and cheaper to support than previous\nproducts. Finally, leading companies may reach Stage 5, which is characterised by all\nof the issues considered at Stage 4 with two important additions. Firstly, financial\nreporting mechanisms are used to ensure that return on DFS investment is clearly\nvisible to management. Secondly, the companies that reach Stage 5 have management\nteams that fully recognise the importance of support to their businesses and\nconsequently devote sufficient focus and resources to this area. The position of each\nof the sample companies on Figure 1 was initially determined by reviewing their\napproach to evaluating customer support during NPD (as described in the text and\nsummarised in Table III) and then verifying this with the companies directly.\nThe workshop, which was run with participating companies, enabled a\nverification of where the companies were positioned on the model. For example,\nVendorC confirmed that that they had an advanced approach. \u201cI think we are at Stage\n4\u2026 we [customer support specialists] are fully allocated to the teams\u2026 the\nquantitative analysis of cost\u2026 we basically do that but we are certainly [not] yet at 5\u201d\n[consensus between the VendorC Quality Manager and Support Specialist]. VendorC\nare currently trying to further improve their design for Supportability practices, as\nindicated by the arrow moving to Stage 5 on Figure1. For AutoB, they are also\nimproving \u201cbut not enough for me to convincingly say we are at Stage 4 [yet]\u201d\n[AutoB\u2014Product Support Specialist]. Overall, Figure 1 was found at the workshop to\nbe an effective tool for discussions on the progress companies have made towards\nfully evaluating support requirements, however, it is still preliminary and obviously\n34\nneeds further empirical verification. (This should include an estimation of the time\nrequired for companies to move between the various stages.)\nSTUDY LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nThe research described in this paper has limitations, which must be acknowledged\u2014\nboth in terms of the scope of the issues studied and the methodology used.\nThe number of aspects of customer support and NPD investigated was limited.\nFor example, informants perceived advantages in designing products for easy and\nefficient support but these advantages were not quantified in any way. Informants\npresumed that Design for Supportability would make new products easier to support\nand consequently reduce cost-of-ownership and in several cases had anecdotal\nevidence. However, this point needs further investigation and can be formulated into\nthe following proposition:\nProposition 1: Products, which are developed after a comprehensive\nevaluation of customer support requirements has been made, will be easier\nand cheaper to support than comparable products where this is not the case.\nAlthough a detailed evaluation of support requirements at the design stage may\nimprove the supportability of products, small organisations such as TelecommA may\nnot necessarily need to implement a formal planning process. This would, of course,\nneed to be considered in any research designed to check Proposition 1.\nWith the smallsample of the current study, external validity is an issue. For\nexample, results from the five companies indicate that more complex products require\nmore elements of support. However, these results are inconclusive. More investigation\nis required of the following proposition:\nProposition 2: Manufacturers of more complex products must provide more\nelements of customer support than are required for simpler products.\nOne of the key methodological limitations is that much of the data collected\nwas \u201cmanager reported\u201d, although triangulation was used where possible. Researchers\nin the future will need to address this issue. For example, longitudinal studies in which\n35\nresearchers are present at key design meetings and actually observe the process of\nevaluation and implementation of customer support requirements are needed.\nFor researchers active in the area of new product development, there are a\nnumber of other areas, which require further investigation. Research is necessary to\nidentify whether the case companies manage customer support at the design stage in a\nway that is typical for their industry or whether, in addition to having large market\nshares, the sample can be considered as being \u201cbest-in-class\u201d in this area. To establish\nthis, a wide survey of companies\u2019 practices is required, ideally covering several\nindustries. The case on VendorC clearly demonstrates the competitive advantage that\ncan be obtained from well-planned support and functionality in products, which\nsupports incremental services. This requires further investigation\u2014are a high\npercentage of manufacturing companies using support to gain a competitive\nadvantage?\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe contribution of this research is that it provided the first empirical evidence on\nhow support is evaluated during NPD in different industries. It showed that leading\ncompanies invest significant resources to ensure that products are easy and\neconomical to support. Previous research (Goffin, 1990) showed that many companies\ndo not evaluate customer support until well into the NPD cycle. The current results\nshow that the sample companies do not make this mistake\u2014they all evaluate support\nat the design stage, albeit to varying degrees of sophistication.\nThe research has important implications for all managers involved with new\nproduct development and, in particular top management who can exercise the greatest\ninfluence. Although the sample size was small, certain best practices can be identified:\n36\n\uf0b7 Closely involving customer support experts in NPD.\n\uf0b7 Performing a comprehensive evaluation of support needs at the design stage and\nsetting suitable design goals.\n\uf0b7 Using data management systems to monitor all aspects of field support.\n\uf0b7 Having top management that recognises the importance of customer support at.\n\uf0b7 Using customer support to gain a competitive advantage and increase revenues.\nIt has clearly been shown that customer support must be given a high enough priority\nduring NPD. If they are not already doing so, manufacturing companies need to focus\nenough time and resources on this area. Overall, the evaluation of customer support\nneeds to be recognised as an essential aspect of new product development.\n37\nREFERENCES\n1) Anthoney, M.T. and McKay, J.
