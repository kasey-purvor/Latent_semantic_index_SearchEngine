In addition to low electrical hysteresis, there is negligible thermal \nhysteresis. PST thin films are therefore promising for EC cooling near room temperature.  \n \nIntroduction \nElectrocaloric (EC) coolers have stimulated great attention since the recent discovery of the giant \nEC effect in ferroelectric thin films [1-2]. This has sparked the desire to develop an \nenvironmentally friendly, powerful and low-cost EC refrigerator [3-7]. The EC effect is typically \ncharacterized by the entropy change, \u2206S, driven by the application\/removal of an electric field, E, \nassociated with a temperature change, \u2206T as follows: \n \n                                                 \na)\n tatiana.correia@npl.co.uk \nCurrent address: National Physical Laboratory, Hampton Road, Teddington, Middlesex, TW11 0LW \nb)\n q.zhang@cranfield.ac.uk \nNPL Management Ltd - Internal \ndE\nT\nP\nS\nE\nE\n2\n1\n1\n \n(1) \nand, \ndE\nT\nP\nc\nT\n\u03c1\nT\nE\nE\n2\n1\n1\n \n(2) \nwhere P is polarization, c is specific heat capacity, \u03c1 is density and E1 and E2 are the starting and \nfinal applied fields, respectively.  These equations are not straightforward to apply if there is \nelectrical or thermal hysteresis, e.g. near first-order phase transitions or within the \u201cglassy\u201d non-\nergodic state of some relaxors [5]. \nLead scandium tantalate, PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 (PST), has a perovskite structure, A(B'B'')O3, in \nwhich B-site disorder leads to relaxor behaviour. Appropriate heat treatments promote B-site \nordering, and so long-range ferroelectric order may be observed [8-10]. Relaxor PST undergoes \na diffuse second-order phase transition whereas a first-order phase transition is found in highly \nordered PST [8-10]. While a paraelectric (or relaxor)-ferroelectric phase transition is known to \noccur between 0 \u00baC and room temperature depending on the degree of PST ordering [8,10], \ndielectric measurements of PST thin films have indicated the existence of several anomalies at \ncryogenic temperatures [11]. The underlying mechanisms are unresolved but could involve \nstructural phase transitions and domain-wall dynamics. Here we investigate the EC effect in a \npartially ordered PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 thin film, which is expected to exhibit a high pyroelectric \ncoefficient, a phase transition near room temperature and slim relaxor-like P-E loops [12-15]. \nFurthermore, PST compositions with  < 0.82 [8] have demonstrated a second-order phase \ntransition and so no thermal hysteresis is expected. \n \nExperimental \nA partially ordered PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 thin film was fabricated by sol-gel using precursors of lead \nacetate trihydrate Pb(OAc)2.3H2O, scandium acetate (Sc(OAc)3, and tantalum ethoxide \nTa(OEt)5. The scandium acetate and tantalum ethoxide were mixed together, dissolved in 2-\nmethoxyethanol (2ME) and refluxed for 10 hrs. Separately, lead acetate trihydrate was dissolved \nin 2ME, and the water was distilled out of the system. Both solutions were mixed and stirred at \nroom temperature for 2 hrs. The final concentration of the synthesized PST sol was 0.3M. PST \nsol was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 sec onto a Pt\/Ti\/SiO2\/Si substrate. Each layer was \nNPL Management Ltd - Internal \npyrolized at 350 \u00baC for 1 min. After the deposition of 5 layers, the film was annealed at 650 \u00baC \nvia Rapid Thermal Annealing with a heating ramp of 18 \u00baC\/sec. The thickness of each layer was \n20 nm, and the above-mentioned process was repeated ten times to obtain the desired 200 nm. \n350 350 m\n2\n top electrodes of Cr\/Au were deposited by thermal evaporation (Fig. 1). Dielectric \nconstant measurements were carried out using a Wayne-Kerr impedance analyzer (Wayne Kerr \nElectronics, UK). P-E loops were obtained by means of a Radiant Technologies RT66A \nferroelectric tester (Radiant Technologies Inc., USA). A Peltier element was used for \ntemperature control.  \n \nResults and Discussion \nX-Ray diffraction data (Fig. 2) suggest that the film adopts a single-phase perovskite \nstructure and shows preferential {111} orientations. The degree of B-site chemical order was \nfound to be \u03a9 = 0.32 from the relative intensities I of the \u00bd \u00bd \u00bd and 100 superlattice reflections, \naccording to [16]: \n1 ,calculated100\nobserved100\n)(\n)(\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\nII\nII\n.\n \n(3) \nThe temperature dependences of the dielectric constant, , and loss tangent, tan , at \ndifferent frequencies are illustrated in Fig. 3. Dielectric constant and loss tangent show maxima \nat Tm near room temperature, and the strong frequency dependence indicates a relaxor-\nferroelectric phase transition. The similarity in Tdd  below and above Tm confirms a second-\norder phase transition. The values of  in our PST thin film are smaller than those in previously \nreported partially ordered PST thin films (between 1000-6000) which were annealed at T > \n700 \u00baC [10]. This may be due to the use of a lower annealing temperature here (650 \u00baC), resulting \nin a smaller average grain size.  \nIn order to evaluate the EC effect in the PST thin film, P-E loops at 1 kHz were measured \nat different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 4. In addition to the frequency dependence of Tm \n(Fig. 3), the slim P-E loops corroborate previously reported relaxor behaviour of partially \nordered PST thin films [10]. The temperature dependence of the polarization at different fields, \nestablished from the upper branches of the hysteresis loops in E > 0 upon cooling  and heating , \nis presented in Fig. 5. The PST thin film exhibits negligible thermal hysteresis. Given that we are \nNPL Management Ltd - Internal \nin an ergodic regime, unlike the relaxor polymer poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene-\nchlorofluoroethylene [P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)] for which direct and indirect measurements do not \nmatch [17], we may apply the indirect thermodynamic analysis to evaluate EC performance. \nUsing Equations (1) and (2), with c = 0.32 J K\n-1\n g\n-1\n and \u03c1 = 8.8 g cm-3 [18], we determined \u2206S vs \nT and \u2206T vs T for different \u2206E using the cooling data (Figs 5a & b, respectively). There is \nevidence for peak in both \u2206S =  -6.3 J K-1 kg-1 and \u2206T = -6.2 \u00baC at 68 \u00baC, probably due to a field-\ninduced relaxor-ferroelectric phase transition. In our PST thin film, |\u2206S| = 4.5 - 6.3 J K-1 kg-1 \nwhich does not exceed the values for e.g. PbZr0.95Ti0.05O3 and P(VDF-TrFE) 55:45 mol % \ncopolymers (8 J\n \nK\n-1\n kg\n-1\n and 60 J K\n-1\n kg\n-1\n, respectively) [1], as expected given that we are \nworking near a second-order phase transition. However, a broad temperature range near room \ntemperature may be exploited. \nIt has been suggested [19,20] that one may compare magnetocaloric materials by \nevaluating refrigerant capacity (RC), and by extension EC materials. From [19] we have: \n \n2\n1\n)(\nT\nT\ndTTSRC ,\n \n(4) \nwhere T1 and T2 are the cold and hot temperatures accessed via the EC effect. Within the \ntemperature range studied, \u2206S varies by less than 27% (Fig. 6a) and contributes significantly to \nRC. We estimate RC = 695 J kg\n-1\n in the limits T1= 1 \u00baC and T2= 127 \u00baC for \u2206E = 774 kV cm\n-1\n. \nThe maximum hysteresis loss, determined from P-E loop area for E > 0 at 9 \u00baC, could at most \nreduce the RC by just 4.8% to 662 J kg\n-1\n. Hence the RC we predict from Equation (1) is a \nreasonable estimate for our relaxor films. The fact that, the estimated RC value in PST thin film \nis much higher than that in magnetocaloric Gd-based materials (360 J kg\n-1\n) [20], indicates that \nelectrocaloric PST thin films may be used as a media in a cost-efficient refrigeration system \noperating near room temperature. \n Conclusions \nA relaxor thin film of PbSc0.5Ta0.5O3 with partial B-site order (\u03a9 = 0.32) was fabricated by sol-\ngel, and subjected to rapid thermal annealing. Its relaxor nature near room temperature was \nconfirmed by slim loops and the frequency dependence of Tm. PST thin films could be promising \nfor EC refrigeration, as they combine a set of remarkable properties: 1) a large EC effect below \nand above room temperature of \u2206S ~ -5 J K-1 kg-1 for under 774 kV cm-1, 2) no thermal \nNPL Management Ltd - Internal \nhysteresis, 3) low electrical losses of 4.8% and 4) a small variation of \u2206S within 1 \u00baC -127 \u00baC \nwhich yields a large RC = 662 J kg\n-1\n for \u2206E = 774 kV cm-1.  \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for the \nfinancial support granted to this work under contract EP\/E035043 (Cranfield) and EP\/E03389X \n(Cambridge). \n \nReferences \n[1] A.
