Introduction \nAt the last Intemational Vacuum Electron Sources Conference, held in Saratov, Russia, the current authors \npresented a paper reporting on preliminary findings from an investigation into the interfacial layer that forms in \nthe oxide cathode over accelerated cathode life (Jenkins et irl. 2003). It was reported that studies were being \nconducted to investigate key issues that could bring about improvement in performance to the oxide cathode, in \norder for the oxide cathode to remain a competitive display technology. One of the key issues identified was the \nneed for characterisation of the interface layer that forms during the operation of an oxide cathode. Although \nthis subject has been investigated extensively before (Rooksby 1940) (Rooksby 1947) (Eisenstein 1949) \n(Wright 1947), ambiguity remains conceming both the nature and the effect of the interfacial layer on the \nperformance of the oxide cathode. There is firm evidence to indicate that this interfacial layer blocks the \n'activating' elements which are necessary for the reduction of the bdrium oxide in the emissive layer to give the \nfree barium that lowers the work function. This blocking effect, therefore, reduces the performance of the \ncathode. In this study the interfacial layer was characterised using a number of analytical techniques in order to \nobtain a comprehensive understanding of the geometry and chemistry of this layer. The techniques that have \nbeen used are scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), secondary ion mass \nspectroscopy (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). \n2. Experimental \nDummy tube electron gun assemblies were constructed and operated under simulated accelerated lifetime \ntesting for 0 h, 1000 h and 2000 h. A range of sample preparation methods was used during this study for \nemissive oxide layer removal. The first entailed stripping the oxide coating away from the nickel substrate with \ntape (sometimes repetitively) until the oxide coating was removed from a sizeable amount of the cathode area, \nthus exposing the underlying interface between the nickel and oxide coating. Another method was cross \nsectioning at the interface. This was achieved in two different ways. The first was producing a tapered cross \nsection by mounting the cathode onto a 10\" aluminium wedge, setting in resin and polishing to a 3pm finish \nfollowed by a final polish with a silica oxide particle suspension. The final type of cross sections were obtained \nby init\/ally stripping the coating, followed by etching away material from both sides of an area of interest with a \nfocused ion beam (W). Specimens were investigated with TEM. S E E D X  images and spectra were acquired \nat 15 keV on a Jeol 8600 Super probe using an Oxford Instruments INCA EDX detector. AES spectra were \ncollected using a VG Microlab Mk 11, using a York field emission gun set at 15 keV with a specimen current of \n12 nA. The spherical analyser was operated at CRR 4. A liquid gallium source was used when etching with the \nW. It was operated with a beam energy of 30keV and 12nA. SIMS depth profiles and images were collected \nusing pulsed 25 .keV gold ions (0.03 PA) for the analysis and 1 keV oxygen ions were used to etch into the \nsample bulk during profiling. TEM images, electron diffraction pattems and EDX spectra were obtained using a \nPhilips CM200 TEM operating at 200 keV. \n. \n3. Results \nPast AES and SEM spectra \nindicated the presence of a skin-like \nlayer consisting of Ba, Sr, A1 and 0 \non the surface of the nickel. Large \ncracks were also present at the nickel \ngrain boundaries. These cracks \ndeveloped and continued to grow \nboth in length and width during the \nlifetime of the cathode. It has been \nshown that the Mg activator was \nlocated within these large cracks \n(Barber et al. 2004). More recently, \ntop-down SIMS images of the surface \nafter stripping of the emissive layer \nFigure 1.

The depth profile from a crack \nregion showed that the Mg signal was constant throughout \nthe depth of the crack. A 3D model confirmed that \nthroughout the profiled volume, Mg was localised at the \ncrack regions. A depth profile of the skin region away from \nany cracks was acquired as well. Here there was no Ni signal \nfor the first 20 seconds of the depth profile, but there were \nhigh intensities of AI, Sr and Ba present, consistent with the \nhypothesis of the thin skin. \nTapered cross sections were produced for cathodes that were \nactivated but not aged. In addition, they were made with \ncathodes that were activated and aged (0 h lifetime), had an \naccelerated 1000 h lifetime and 2000 h lifetime. In the first \ninstance, when the cathode was activated but not aged, it \nwas observed that interactions at the interface had taken \nplace. From EDX maps of these samples there was evidence \nfor the Dresence of this skin and internal oxidation of the \ndepth profiles were acquired from the whole of \nFigure 2.

Cross sections of cathodes that were activated and \na g d  showed the initial development of cracks. EDX maps \nof these areas highlighted very intense Mg signals from \nthese regions. All of the aforementioned observations were \nI \nmore c o w o n  with increased operation time, to the point where SEM and EDX analysis showed that these \ncracks formed a network, which could underpin the nickel grains as shown in figure 1. Cross sections were \nproduced with FIB for cathodes that were operated for 0 hr, loo0 hr and Zoo0 hr of accelerated life (see figure \n2). In all the images a very complex strncture of layers were present. It seemed that there was a thin layer (skin) \nbeneath which was nickel oxide; believed to form by internal oxidation of the nickel during the operation of the \ncathode. It was clearly seen that the NiO layer thickness increased as a function of time. Finally at the NiO layer \nI bulk nickel interface fine cracks were readily found. Within these horizontal fine cracks it was possible to find \nBa, Sr, AI, 0 and Mg. Although the fine cracks (511111) were oxidised in nature, Al. Ba and Sr were associated \ntogether but Mg was a separate precipitate. \n4. Conclusions \nA range of surface and analytical techniques were used to investigate the intekctions taking place at the oxide \ncathode interface during operation. h g e  cracks were found to form in the bulk alloy, these regions being rich \nin Ba, Mg, AI and 0. It seemed probable that intemal oxidation of the nickel waS taking place and these cracks \nform an internal surface at ,which the barium oxide was being reduced by the Mg and Al activators. In addition, \na thin layer reaction product containing Ba, Sr, 0 and AI formed at the nickel alloy I nickel oxide.interface. \nThere was a direct correlation between the thickness of the interfacial nickel oxide and operational time. The \nobservations support the view that the majority of cracks formed during activation and ageing. Whilst these \ncracks continued to grow during accelerated lifetime testing, the number of cracks \nRem ained constant. The fact that the skin layer only contained the Al activator and the cracks contain both Mg \nand AI activators, coupled with the higher Mg diffusion coefficient suggested AI was particularly associated \nwith cathode life performance with Mg being most important in the earliest stages of cathode operation. \n5.
