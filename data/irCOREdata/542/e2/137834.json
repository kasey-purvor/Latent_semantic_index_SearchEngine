The conclusions are \nthat it is possible to target sample the soil physical and chemical status of fields and locate \nareas of high weed density following the use of inexpensive, non-invasive techniques (EMI, \naerial digital photography (ADP) and radiometry).  Semi-automated field reconnaissance \nsystems on all terrain vehicles and combines also assist in locating the position of weed \npatches.  P and K fertiliser can be replenished by using the \u201coff-take\u201d values determined from \nyield maps, whilst crop density in the spring period shows potential for the management of \nnitrogen fertiliser in cereal crops using ADP and could also be a benefit in the application of \nagrochemicals.  Currently the most economically viable method to determine field \ntopography is to use very simple surveying techniques, there is potential to automate this. \n \n1 Introduction \nThe field factors influencing yield variation are given in Table 1, these are represented \nfrom an operational perspective in two major groups, namely: those over which the farmer \nhas little control and those over which he may be able to influence the final yield.  Neither \nthese groupings or the solutions are new; farmers have been addressing these problems for \ncenturies. \n \nThese factors can be regrouped into 4 major categories for the purpose of determining both \nthe level and extend of the variability, see Table 2, which also indicates the most promising \nmethods. Each of the Groups in Table 2 will be reviewed for those with the greatest practical \nsignificance and have seen a substantial research input for temperate agriculture. \n  2\n2 Soil-Water factors \nThe correlation between the variation in yield and the variation in available water content \nhas been well documented (Forbes & Watson, 1992; Braum et al., 1999).  Available water \ncontent is a function of soil texture (Hall et al., 1977), therefore, an understanding of soil \ntextural distribution is an essential when considering precision farming. \n \nA field with a large range of soil texture may warrant management based upon that \nvariation, whereas a more uniform textural variation may not.  This is illustrated in Fig.1 \nwhich shows the semi-variogram of yield for 3 fields in the United Kingdom where Shagsby \nshows a significant variation in yield (2 t\/Ha) over a 70 m distance, Twelve Acre (1.2 t\/Ha) \nover 25 m distance and Holly Field effectively no variation other than the random error of \nmeasurement (Lark et al., 1998). \n \nOne of the limiting factors linking the commercial application of precision farming is the \ncost of sampling data at sufficient intensities to provide accurate mapped information \n(Fogbrook, 1999).  Whilst mapping soil-water features may only need to be a one-off \noperation, current prices (\u00a325\/sample, US$38\/sample) for manual sampling limit the \nsampling intensity to one 1 m deep auger sample per hectare (100 m grid) of which Fig.2 is \ntypical.  This shows three principal soil series; the Wickham series (clay loam over stoneless \nclay) is a poorly drained stagnogley whilst the Ludford (clay loam) and Maplestead series \n(sandy loam) are more freely draining brown earths.  Soil sampling at this intensity gives a \nreasonable overview of the major soil types\/textures and enables targeted profile pit \nexcavation at (1-2\/series) to enable farmers to adjust to the practical significance of the \nvariability in their fields.  However, this sampling density is inadequate for varying seed rate \nand nutrients. \n  3\n \nIn arable soils where salinity is not a significant factor, measurements of electrical \nconductivity are primarily a function of soil moisture and clay contents.  Recent studies into \nthe use of electrical-magnetic induction (EMI) have shown strong correlation with soil \ntexture when the survey is conducted with the soils at field capacity, see Figs.3 and 4 for two \ndifferent fields (Waine et al., 2000).  This is based upon the unique relationship for both the \nvolumetric moisture content at \n(1) field capacity (FC), i.e. when the macropores have drained 2-3 days after rainfall \nor irrigation, and \n(2) permanent wilting point (PWP), i.e. the moisture content at which plants are \npermanently wilted and will die if water is not added  \nand soil texture as suggested by the USDA in 1955 and given in Brady (1990) using the \nUSDA soil textural classification. \n \nThe data in Figs. 3 and 4 show the equivalent UK data from Hall et al. (1977) namely the \nUK FC and UK PWP lines.  The abissa for these figures was based upon a textural fineness \nclass for the soils using the weighted index given below by Waine (1999): \n \n Fineness class = -0.898 (Tw 2) + 3.8704 (Tw) + 1.9686  (1) \n where: Tw =  0.03 (% clay) \u2013 0.004 (% sand) \nThese figures show that for the representative soils that the sandy soils will be at field \ncapacity and permanent wilting point at much lower moisture content values than the loam \nand clay soils.  Fortunately, the slope of the UK relationships for the FC line whilst becoming \n  4\nless steep at the clay end of the textural band does not exhibit the same plateau effect as the \nUS line.  Hence this relationship is a valuable indicator of soil texture for a given volumetric \nmoisture content at field capacity.  UK soils are typically at field capacity during the period \nfrom mid-November to April.  The data collected at field capacity in February and March \nrespectively show a close relationship with the conceptual relationships using the data from \nHall et al. (1977). \n \nStudies conducted at other times in the growing season, as shown for July and August, are \nvaluable in estimating soil moisture deficits to indicate levels of crop moisture stress which \ncould then form the basis for variable irrigation purposes.  The studies by Waine et al., \n(2000) concluded that it would be possible to determine soil texture to within one textural \ngroup, but would required targeted field soil data collection for total confidence. \n \nThe results of a detailed study by James et al., (2000), using an EMI scanner along 24 m \nspaced field tramlines at intervals of 10 m for the field shown in Fig.2 is given in Fig. 5.  \nThis shows higher electrical conductivity values corresponding with the clay loam over clay \nsoil with lower values corresponding to the sandy loam soils.  The results of detailed studies \nof soil texture of 168 cores collected using a tractor-mounted soil coring device at a grid \nspacing of 50 m for the perimeter of the field and 24 m in the central zone are shown in Fig. \n6.  Comparing the revised textural boundaries with the EMI results in Fig.6 show a close \ncorrelation between EMI conductivity readings and the textural boundaries of the detailed \nsoil survey.  This method has been improved by using an objective technique, cluster \nanalysis, which, when applied to EMI data, provides a method to zone fields into classes \nreflecting underlying variations in soil texture and other physical properties, Taylor et al. \n(2001). \n  5\n \nCurrently EMI surveys cost \u00a314\/ha, (US$20ha) (Smith, 2001) from which it can be \nconcluded that EMI surveying provides a cost-effective method to compliment traditional soil \nsurvey practices by providing rapid, non-invasive information on the variation in soil texture \nand available water.  The traditional survey methods could then be focussed upon the \ntransects XX1 and YY1 in Fig.5.  The yield map in Fig. 7 shows an average of 1 t\/ha \ndifference in the average yield between the major soil groups. \n \nThere is now from commercial sources, evidence that EMI will also distinguish between \ndifferent levels of soil compaction (Smith, 2001) as shown in Fig. 8 (left).  The patterns \nrunning across the map result from compaction caused by farm traffic travelling between the \ngates on the left and right of the field.  The effect of subsequent targeted soil loosening of \nthose traffic lanes only is shown in Fig. 8 (right). \n \nFollowing surveys of this nature the authors would recommend excavating a number of \nprofile pits and photograph them for the farmer\/agronomist to study and file for future use.  It \nis worthy of note that none of the good farmers whose fields were used in the HGCA funded \nproject, had any knowledge of the overall variability of the sub-soils in the selected fields and \nexpressed benefit from observing the detailed analysis of the profile pits. \n \nStudies by Yule et al. (1999) using a fully instrumented tractor with GPS to map field \nperformance demonstrated that the effects of compaction almost doubled tillage costs at the \nheadlands and gateways.  Noticing the relatively low average engine power utilization (47%) \nin their first test field, they subsequently operated the tractor in the highest gear possible at \n  6\nless than the rated engine speed in a second field and increased the engine power utilization \nto 56%, saving \u00a34.70\/ha (US$7.00\/ha) in cultivation costs. \n \nDetailed draught force maps produced by Richards (2000) using both the inboard tractor-\nlinkage draught force sensing pins and additional extended octagonal ring force transducers \n(Godwin, 1975 & Kirisci et al., 1994) show variation in subsoiler draught forces operating at \na depth of 0.35 m, see Fig.9.  This shows the higher forces appear to coincide with the \ncompaction associated with the previous seasons tramlines.  To achieve the results the \ndraught control system has to be immobilised which unfortunately, from an operational \nperspective, reduces workrate, increases slip and consumes more fuel per unit area.  Given \nthese drawbacks, the method is not recommended for commercial use. \n \nRichards (2000) also used the tractor based GPS system to map all vehicle movements \nwithin a field throughout a complete growing season.  The primary conclusion was that for \nroutine blanket field operations there was no major benefit but the system has potential for \nidentifying areas of a field where concentrated wheelings are a problem, eg. collecting and \ntransporting both harvested arable and forage crops, see Fig. 10 a & b which shows the \npathways taken by the trailer when both unloaded and loaded respectively. \n \nA recent example of the benefits of precise information on the charges in soil type is the \nwork of Maguire (2000) where the known variation in soil texture in Shagsby Field, were \nused to modify the seed rate of onion seeds to improve the size uniformity of the onion crop.  \nThe farmer reporting that he had satisfied his target marketable crop from 70 of the planted \n100 acres, effectively increasing his marketable yield by 43% from improvements in yield \nand quality (size). \n  7\n \nThere is evidence that the size or the \u201cclodiness\u201d of the tilth in the seed bed can effect crop \nestablishment (Malik, 1985 and Marchanko, 1989) and that increasing the seed rate in the \nrougher conditions and reducing the rate in finer seed beds should be considered.  This is \nparticularly critical as the effects of lower seed rates become the agronomic norm.  The \nfundamental method to determine clod size is to conduct a sieve analysis of the diameter of \nthe aggregates as used by Spoor & Godwin (1984). \n \nData from Bogrekci (2001) given in Fig. 11 shows clod size maps drawn from 30 sieve \nanalyses following mouldboard ploughing of two experimental areas with a range of clod \nmean weight diameters from 20 to 95 mm and 50 to 100 mm in a clay loam and sandy loam \nsoil respectively.  The larger clods to the right of the clay soil are an old headland area where \nthere has been more compaction.  \n \nSieving soil tilths and constructing a clod size distribution curve is time consuming and \ndifficult under wet conditions, photographic images such as those developed by Campbell, \n(1979), however, are quick and simple but is difficult to put into practice.  Real-time vision \nsystems using a video camera mounted behind a cultivator recording the seed bed (Stafford & \nAmbler, 1990) have automated the procedure.  Subsequent work by Stafford & Ambler \n(1994) combined tilth quality and in-field position. \n \nWhilst optical solutions can be used objectively to assess the surface roughness of the \nseedbed the subsequent analysis is complex.  Alternative systems would be to have a non-\ncontact method to record the surface roughness either using a laser profile meter, Sandri et al. \n(1998) or an ultrasonic displacement transducer, Scarlett et al. (1997).  Both show good \n  8\ncorrelations with the mean clod size of the soil aggregates determined by sieve analysis.  The \nultrasonic method has a significantly lower cost and the ability to directly calculate the \narithmetic mean size (AMS) of the distribution with a simpler analysis.  Application of the \nultrasonic technique by Bentley (2000) showed that there was no significant difference at the \n95% confidence level between the AMS from the ultrasonic sensor and sieve analysis. \nUsing mechanical methods, Bogrekci (2001) has shown a near linear relationship between \nsensor output and the mean weight diameter (MWD) determined by sieve analysis over a \nrange of three aggregate size distributions.  The work covered MWD\u2019s of 93 mm, 32 mm and \n14 mm, for tilths produced by mouldboard ploughing alone, and ploughing followed by a \nspring tine cultivator and a rotary harrow, as shown in Fig. 12. \n \n3 Topographic Factors \nTopography is one of the most obvious causes of variation found in field crops both from \nits direct effect on micro-climate and related soil factors such as soil temperature, which \ninfluences germination, tiller production and crop growth.  It is for the majority of practical \nfarming purposes unchangeable and as a result can only be used to explain variation. \nThe amount of solar radiation received by a crop in temperate regions is directly affected \nby the topography of a field.  Experiments conducted by Fiez et.al. (1994) found that in two \nsuccessive years yield varied by 55% and 35% respectively depending upon slope, position \nand aspect.  The results of theoretical studies using the CERES wheat model (Ritchie, et al., \n1988) by Geary (2001) show a possible loss in wheat grain yield of 1 t\/ha on northern slopes \nat approximately 10% slope.  They also show a small improvement in the total biomass yield \non southern slopes with no significant improvement in grain yield. \nAlthough major topographic features are obvious to the naked eye these need to be \nquantified to enable comparison and understanding of slope processes.  A study undertaken \n  9\nby Geary, (2001) reviews the alternative methods for assessing topography showing that they \nvary greatly in cost, speed and accuracy, see Table 3.  The study was conducted on a known \ncircuit of farm tracks around a field with given bench mark positions to enable repeatable \ncomparisons to be made.  The study was conducted before \u201cselective availability\u201d had been \nswitched off and current figures are now marginally more accurate.  This is illustrated by the \nfact that the vertical plane accuracy for a quasi-static DGPS with a 60 second residence time \nimproved from 2.78 m to 2.57 m. \n \nThe results show that the cost generally increases with the level of accuracy required.  \nTherefore the desired level of accuracy needs to be known before a method of assessment can \nbe chosen.  The level of accuracy depends upon what the information is required for and \nwhether \u201creal time\u201d or \u201cpost processed\u201d data is required.  For most of these applications post \nprocessed data is adequate.  If, for instance, the slope of the land is relatively flat and is \nrequired for surface irrigation then the accuracy needs to be very high (\u00b110 mm).  However, \nif the data is required to assess the variation of the surface undulation in understanding yield \nvariation to manage agricultural inputs, then the accuracy required is by no means as great \nand estimation of field slope to \u00b11\u00ba should suffice. \n \nWhilst the Total Station is the benchmark surveying system with an accuracy of \u00b15 mm, a \nminimum of two surveyors are required and it is relatively time consuming with the added \ncomplication of locating the survey with a recognised national grid system.  It is, however, \nsignificantly faster than the traditional theodolite, with less potential for human error and the \nadded advantage of computerised data handling, calculations and map production. \n \n  10\nSimple Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS) systems are accurate to within 1 \nm in a horizontal plane, however, the errors are significantly greater in the vertical plane for a \nmobile unit, eg. 4.67 m.  The simultaneous recording of a second fixed point and post \nprocessing can reduce these as can a longer residence time at a given point.  This needs to be \n30 minutes to reduce the error to 0.56 m. \n \nFollowing earlier work to improve upon the accuracy of the DGPS in the vertical \ndimension by Yang et al., (1997) and Yule et al., (1999) two inclinometers were mounted on \na vehicle at right angles to each other.  One inclinometer was used to measure the pitch of the \nvehicle (combine or tractor) and the other to measure the roll.  This system had the potential \nto correct the vertical dimension data for minimal cost over the DGPS System (\u00a3500).  Table \n3 shows that the system performed marginally better than the DGPS system but was not \nsufficiently accurate. \n \nCarrier Phase GPS works by using a base station to measure phase variation over the \nlogging period.  By doing this the DGPS signal can be greatly enhanced giving a typical \naccuracy of \u00b120 mm.  Carrier phase data has to be post processed so the data can not be used \nin real time.   The system gives good accuracy combined with a relatively low capital cost \nand single person operation. \n \nReal-Time Kinematic GPS is similar in design to Carrier Phase GPS, however, due to a \nreal-time radio link between base station and the rover, the position can be given in real time.  \nAlthough real time positioning may be desirable if a point needs to be relocated when it \ncomes to assessing topography in most agricultural situations this is not necessary. Table 3:   \n  11\nComparison of topographic assessment methods: their accuracy (prior to switching off \nselective availability), residence time and cost (after Geary, 2001) \n \nThe costs per hectare are compared by Nugteren & Robert (1999) who estimate a cost for \nthe Total Station to range between \u00a324\/ha (US$36\/ha) and \u00a313\/ha (US$20\/ha) for areas \nbetween 1000 ha and 25,000 ha.  For the same range the high resolution Real-Time \nKinematic GPS systems the estimated cost ranges between \u00a333\/ha (US$50\/ha) and \u00a32.64\/ha \n(US$4\/ha).  The break-even point being 1900 ha at approximately \u00a318\/ha (US$27\/ha). \n \nFollowing the results of the comparison above, an experiment was conducted by Hann \n(2001) to compare the relative speed and accuracy of a handheld Abney Level and a handheld \nClinometer (Bannister and Raymond, 1972) to make quick, relatively accurate, estimates of \ntopography at modest cost, as used in soil and water engineering practice.  The results \nshowed that both methods could measure the slope to within \u00b10.3%.  Hence a 100 m long \nsection would give a vertical error of 0.3 m.  Changing the effect of section length from 50 m \nto 200 m and the accuracy had no significant effect upon the accuracy.  Each reading required \napproximately 1 minute and the additional cost of the equipment was \u00a3100.  The cost\/ha of \nthis system is almost independent of area and is estimated at \u00a32-3\/ha (US$3-5\/ha) depending \nupon topography. \nThe mapping procedure would be: \n(1) Split the field into zones of similar slope placing poles on the ridge line and grade \nbreak lines using an All Terrain Vehicle equipped with a GPS (for horizontal \npositioning), \n(2) Read the percentage slope from the Abney Level or Clinometer, \n  12\n(3) Adjust the plan for slope in the office using the above data to produce aspect and \nslope maps. \nThis system is inexpensive, simple and of sufficient accuracy for precision farming and \nwould, therefore, be the current recommended method. \n \n4 Soil Nutrition \nIt is in this area that the greatest difficulties and expense can develop.  Table 4 reports \ntypical costs for soil nutritional analysis as quoted to the farmer and include collection and \nlaboratory analysis.  From this it can be seen that if a field can be considered homogenous \nand a number of samples collected from walking a typical W pattern in the field and bulked \ntogether as one sample, the costs for a 10 ha field are affordable.  However, if this analysis is \nconducted on a 1 ha grid basis then the costs escalate by a factor of 10 to an unaffordable \nlevel for grain crops, when estimates of the benefits of improved nutrient management by \nEarl et al. (1996) and Godwin et al. (1999) are in the order of \u00a317\/ha (US$25\/ha). \n \nThe solution to this problem therefore lies in targeting the sampling regime based on maps \nof crop performance (historic yield or real time crop density either from satellite or airborne \nplatforms) or soil texture maps (EMI).  A valuable comparison of targeted and grid sampling \nmethods is reported by Thomas et al. (1999) who compare a targeting strategy based upon the \nNormalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with a 100 m grid as shown in Fig. 13.   \n \nThe NDVI data was derived from the red and near-infrared data from a SPOT satellite \nimage and its near linear relationship to crop yield (Zmuda & Taylor (1990).  Fig. 13 shows 8 \nsampling zones where 16 random sub-samples (Oliver et al., 1997) were extracted and \n  13\nbulked together in comparison to 26 grid point samples, where 16 sub-samples were extracted \nin a 1 m grid pattern around the sampling point and bulked together.  All samples were sent \nfor laboratory measurement of phosphorous (P), potassium (K) and Magnesium (Mg). \n \nA comparison of the statistics of the two methods is presented in Table 5 which shows the \naverage values are similar, especially when their indices are compared.  The index values \nshow a deficiency (Index value of 1) of both K and Mg and maintenance level (Index value \nof 3) for P.  The minimum values for all nutrients are different for the two sampling \nprocedures but both indicate soil nutritional deficiencies.  The maximum values are different \nfor P and K with the targeted values indicating lower values. \n \nFurther spatial analysis of the grid results showed that both phosphorous (Fig. 14) and \npotassium were lower in the Northern part of the field and higher in the Southern part.  There \nwas no consistent spatial pattern for magnesium.  In comparison the targeted samples \nindicated a deficient level (Index 1) for zones B and C for phosphorous and all zones \ndeficient in potassium.  The targeted method indicating 2 zones at Index 0 and 6 zones at \nIndex 1 for magnesium, in comparison the grid data showed 5 points at Index 0 and 21 at \nIndex 1. \n \nThe above comparison would result in some differences in field management practice: \nwhere: \n(1) Grid sampling would result in higher phosphorous and potassium application \nrates in the Northern part of the field and in a uniform application rate of \nmagnesium (due to no clear spatial pattern) and \n  14\n(2) Targeted sampling would result in uniform application rates of potassium and \nmagnesium with additional phosphorous applied to the deficient zones B and C. \nThe targeted soil sampling technique whilst not producing an exact correspondence with \nthe grid samples provides a sensible fertiliser strategy at approximately one third of the cost \nof collecting and processing the grid samples.  As a result given the excellent spatial \nresolution of soil textural boundaries given by the EMI systems, practical field agronomists \nare now considering how best to collect targeted soil samples, Rigley & Gould (2000). \n \nWith the base line nutritional conditions mapped and at a satisfactory level, the prudent \nmanagement practice would be to adopt a replenishment strategy to compensate for the P and \nK removed at harvest as suggested by Moore (1997).  Table 6 gives the rates removed from a \ntypical crop of wheat and Fig. 15 an application map derived from the yield map assuming \nthat the mass of the straw removed at any point is approximately equivalent to 665% of the \nmass of grain. \nAirborne platforms (Taylor et al.., 2000) have proved to have a significant advantage over \nsatellite systems as \n(1) Flights can be arranged to suit weather conditions, to avoid the problems of \ncoincidence of cloud cover and satellite availability, and \n(2) A vast improvement in resolution with pixel sizes representing a field area of \n0.5 m \u00d7 0.5 m as opposed to 20 m \u00d7 20 m for example, from SPOT imagery.   \nThe NDVI data from the Airborne Digital Photography (ADP) has correlated well with \nboth plant shoot numbers (early in the growing season) and Green Area Index (GAI) (later in \nthe growing season), and as such is proving to be valuable in managing the spatial application \nof nitrogen (Wood et al., 1998 and Taylor et al., 2000).  One of a series of shoot density \n  15\nimages through the winter period are shown in Fig. 16, for a field where the canopy has been \ndeliberately modified by sowing wheat at different seed rates.  This technique can now be \napplied to a wider group of fields where the same or similar varieties have been sown at \napproximately the same date.  Only 8 field samples are needed to give a good correlation \nwith NDVI data. \n \n5 Crop Weeds, Pests and Diseases \nThere is now substantial evidence to show that in many circumstances the distribution of \nsome weed species in cereal crops is non-uniform (patchy) including the major grass weeds \nand that these patches are relatively stable within a season and from season to season.  The \ncontrol of a grass weed in a grass crop requires the use of a herbicide with a high degree of \nselectivity and often a relatively high cost.  There is therefore, the potential to make \nsubstantial savings in spray input costs by spatially targeting herbicide applications.  \nLutman et al., 1998 estimate that savings in the range \u00a35-15\/ha could be achieved depending \nupon the cost of implementing a spatially variable application strategy. \n \nOne approach to the spatial treatment of weeds and weed patches is to control a spray \ndelivery system in direct response to the outputs from a sensing system mounted on the \ntreatment vehicle (e.g. Felton, 1995).  While this approach is very appropriate for the control \nof weeds in fallow or on roadsides\/pavements, it is much less relevant to the control of weeds \nin a crop situation because: \n(1) Weeds are often difficult to detect at the optimum time for spray treatment \nparticularly in the presence of a growing crop - it may also be appropriate to use a \nsingle weed patch map for applications over more than one crop and one season; \n  16\n(2) There needs to be the opportunity to determine an appropriate dose rate and tank \nmix to give optimum control; \n(3) In many circumstances it is not appropriate to carry a wide range of chemicals on \nthe sprayer that may not then be used. \nAn alternative approach that has therefore been developed (Miller & Paice, 1998) is the \nuse of a treatment map that is derived from a weed\/weed patch map with elements to account \nfor: \n(1) Likely movements of weed patches between mapping and treatment due for \nexample to seed dispersal and movement during cultivation and harvesting. \n(2) The selection of products and product mixtures to give control. \n(3) The dose response characteristics of the products to be applied. \n(4) The characteristics of the weed patch detection system - the greater the reliability \nand resolution of the detection system the greater the opportunity to reduce dose \nrates or not treat some parts of the field. \nSuch an approach does require a useable and cost effective method of generating weed \npatch maps.  Although there has been some progress with the development of automated \ndetection systems based on either spectral reflectance characteristics and\/or image analysis \nmethods (e.g. see Christiansen, 1999), it is unlikely that such systems will be available \nparticularly to detect grass weeds in cereal crops, within the foreseeable future.  Differences \nin spectral reflectance between weeds and cereal crops can be measured but such differences \nhave been shown not to be a sound basis for weed patch detection because of the effects of \ngrowing conditions, varieties, nutrition and lighting conditions at the time of detection.  \nImage analysis-based techniques are being developed for weed detection in widely spaced \ncrops such as sugar beet and vegetables but the complexity of images and the computing \n  17\npower needed for weed\/crop discrimination means that any such systems are currently a long \nway from commercial development. \n \nFor this reason approaches to weed patch mapping based on manual detection and GPS \nlocation are being developed.  Manually walking the whole of a field area is slow and \nexpensive although such an approach can usefully assess changes to weed patch boundaries \nbetween seasons.  Mapping from tractors, combines or an ATV is a more practical option, as \nshown in Fig. 17, providing that there is: \n(1) An adequate field of view with the ability to see the weed patches \u2013 this depends \non the vehicle and the state of the weed\/crop combination; \n(2) An appropriate means of recording combinations of weed species and density. \n \nPractical experience has shown that, particularly when field surveying from an ATV, \nactivating switches or panels on a touch screen while driving across a field or down tramlines \nis difficult.  A logging system based on voice recognition has therefore been constructed and \nvalidated against maps generated from detailed field surveys, as shown in Fig. 18.  These \napproaches are the subject of continuing research and development and should lead to \npractical systems within a two to three year horizon. \n \nAn alternative approach to direct weed patch mapping is to use targeted field walking to \nexamine areas that can be identified as having a high vegetative index either from ADP or \nmeasurements from vehicle mounted radiometers, as shown in Fig. 19.  The vegetative index \nmap can then be used to define patch boundaries with information from the field walking \nrelating to weed species and density.  The potential for making weed maps using this method \nis currently being assessed in a series of field trials. \n  18\n \nFor foliar diseases in arable, many of the fungicide treatments that are used have a mode \nof action that relates primarily to the surface of a leaf with either curative or protectant modes \nof action or a combination of both.  A potential method of reducing the use of such materials \nis therefore to match the delivered dose\/volume of fungicide to the leaf area of the crop \ncanopy to be treated.  The development of patch spraying systems such as that described by \nMiller et al., (1998) provide systems that could deliver a variable rate volume application \nwith a 5:1 range but with no change in spray quality.  The challenge is to develop sensing \nsystems that will enable a map of leaf area index to be generated that can then be used as a \nbasis for controlling such applications.  Work has been conducted using measurements of \nspectral reflectance from vehicle mounted sensors (and potentially ADP could be used in the \nsame way) as the basis for varying fungicide doses within a field with variable results.  \nResults reported by Secher (1997) suggested that significant increases in yield of a winter \ncereal crop could be achieved by distributing the dose of a fungicide in relation to crop \ncanopy characteristics as measured using boom-mounted radiometers.  This conclusion was \nnot supported by Bjerre (1999) with an indication that penetration of spray into areas of high \nfoliage density may have been a limiting factor in the work.  While results from field \nexperiments reported by Miller et al., (2000) did not show differences in deposit levels in \nplots in areas identified as having high or low crop canopy density based on measurements \nwith boom-mounted radiometers, the work did show significant differences in deposit levels \nand distribution at different growth stages in a winter wheat crop.  The implications from this \nwork relate to the potential to improve application of crop protection chemicals with a \npredominately leaf surface mode of action by accounting initially for the mean level of \ncanopy development and subsequently for spatial variability across a field.  There is strong \nevidence to show that sensing systems such as boom-mounted radiometers and ADP are an \n  19\neffective method of determining crop canopy density parameters such as leaf area index at \nearly stages of cereal crop growth providing that: \n(1) The crop is in a healthy and weed-free state. \n(2) There is a calibration to take account of effects due to variety and growing \nconditions. \n \nAt later stages of growth such methods loose discrimination and there is probably a need \nto link the outputs from more than one sensing approach.  The use of multiple sensors would \nalso enable an improved interpretation of the measurements from a radiometer where effects \ndue to colour and canopy structure inter-relate.  Methods of characterising canopy structure at \nlater stages of growth using more than one sensing system are now being investigated in \nresearch funded by the Home Grown Cereals Authority in the UK.  Objectives of the work \nare the creation of mapped data for the control of chemical application equipment and also \nlinks to conventional agronomy via a description of crop growth stage. \n \nFor insect pests, in most cases the mobility of the pest prevents an effective control \nstrategy based on the generation of a map.  The exception to this is soil-based pests such as \npotato cyst nematodes where mapping approaches based on soil sample counts have been \nused to generate maps of nematode eggs\/gram of soil and these used as a basis of control \ntreatment application (Evans et al., 2000). \n \n6 Conclusions \nRecent technological advances have permitted rapid non-invasive methods to map: \n(1) soil texture, structure  and moisture content (EMI and tilth sensors), \n(2) heavy traffic (GPS),  \n  20\n(3) crop density (NDVI from ADP) and \n(4) weed patches (NDVI from airborne (ADP) and ground based radiometers). \nThese permit: \n(1) Targeted sampling of soil physical and chemical status together with areas with a \nhigh weed population. \n(2) Nutrient application on a replenishment basis for P and K and a crop density basis \nfor N, and \n(3) Seed rate variation depending upon the available water of the soil to control crop \nquality (size). \nFurther work needs to be conducted to automate the simple topographic surveys as the \ncurrently available more accurate methods are not economically viable. \n  21\nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their thanks to: \n(1) HGCA, Hydro Agri, Agco Ltd., MAFF, ERSPC, DTI, Galaxy PrecisionAg \nServices Ltd., RDS Technology Ltd., and Earth Science Systems Ltd., for their \nsupport. \n(2) Their many colleagues, in particular Gavin Wood, Richard Earl, John Taylor,  \nMike Hann, James Welsh (now Elm Farm Research Station) and Simon \nBlackmore (now KVL, Denmark) of Cranfield University at Silsoe, Silsoe \nResearch Institute and Peter Lutman and Nicola Perry at IACR Rothamsted. \n(3) Mike Carver and Stuart Knight of Arable Research Centres, and  \n(4) The many doctoral students whose work has been cited  \nwhose contribution has been invaluable in bringing together the combined work. \n  22\nReferences \nBannister; Raymond S (1972).
