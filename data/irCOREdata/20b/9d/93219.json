Despite the important contributions \nwe have assembled here, and the many useful conversations we\u201fve shared with \ncolleagues since beginning this project, the goal of attaining a definitive critical social \npsychology of racism remains elusive. There are many reasons for this, some of which \nstem from a disciplinary history of social psychology that has at times viewed overtly \npolitical discourse - much like issues of cultural-historical contextualization - as \nanathema to good science. Another reason that might be cited here is the often \nimpoverished notion of \u201esocial\u201f that qualifies social psychology: a \u201esocial\u201f which all too \noften may be collapsed into the analytical frame of individualizing psychological \nhumanism (Farr, 1996; Moscovici, 1972).  \n Aside from these considerations, there is another reason why a definitive critical \nsocial psychology of racism and antiracism cannot, and should not, be \u201efinally\u201f reached. \nAn obvious consideration in this respect is the multiple permutations of historical forms \nof racism that require the ongoing generation of new analytical frames, new modes of \nintervention that will not simply be completed, \u201efinalised\u201f. Another consideration is that a \ncritical social psychology of racism and antiracism is best served by a field of multiple \ntypes of analysis, enquiry, debate and involvement (Riggs and Augoustinos, this issue). \nTo speak of having attained a definitive critical social psychology of racism seems, to \n                                            \n1\n The first of these was held in Cape Town on the 20\nth\n June at the International Society for \nTheoretical Psychology Conference, the second in Durban on 29\nth\n June at Beyond the Pale \nInternational Critical Psychology Conference.  \n \nus, to point to a homogenization of methodological and theoretical perspectives that is \nthe exact opposite of our goals here. The last thing that a critical social psychology of \nracism should aim at is the entrenchment of an orthodoxy of methods, perspectives, \napproaches: for a social formation as multifaceted and historically-variable as racism, \nwe benefit from as much conceptual, political and analytical richness as we are able to \nprovoke.  \n A critical social psychology of racism and antiracism then will never be \ncomplete, just as it will never be wholly singular, or cohesive, at least not in the sense \nof being impervious to argumentation and debate. It is in this spirit, of camaraderie, \ndebate, innovation and collaboration that we wish to offer some reflections on future \npossible directions for a critical social psychology of racism and antiracism that we \nhope will never attain a definitive or singular status. \n \nDifferent modes of writing: opposing \u2018regimes of whiteness\u2019  \nIt is by no means incidental that at the beginning of their paper Kirkwood, Liu & \nWeatherall make reference to a work of fiction, namely Toni Morrison\u201fs (1999) \nParadise. Our point here is not so much to emphasize the illustrative role of fiction - \nwhich we can agree is often exemplary - but to consider the political utility of making \nreference to a different epistemological domain to that of the social sciences. Clearly \ndifferent \u201erules of truth\u201f apply in the world of fiction to those which structure and \ncondition what we can say and\/or write in the institutionalised settings of social \nscientific discourse. Different things can be said, different statements, positionings, \nimaginings, modes of self-reflection can be managed here than might be \naccommodated within the stricter truth-conditions of, say, mainstream disciplinary \nsocial psychology.  \nThis in itself may strike us as a less than striking formulation; the pertinence of \nsuch a distinction is best grasped in view of the pervasiveness of particular formations \nof \u201ewhiteness\u201f, \u201ewhiteness\u201f that is not only as an insidious category of psychic \ninvestment through which particular histories of privilege are consolidated (as \ndocumented in this special issue), but also as an epistemic principle, that is, as subtle \n(and sometimes less than subtle) precondition of knowledge, belonging, authority, \nrationality, moral rightness, and so on. Here we are pointing to the role of whiteness as \nan ordering principle of knowledge, or, perhaps more directly yet to the multiple veils of \nwhite racism which conditions and structures the truth-value of subjectivity.  \nWe might put this in a different way, by pointing to the pervasiveness of those \nknowledge-systems, institutional structures, concentrations of wealth, and modes of \nself-reflection that maintain strong historical ties to an imperial and colonial past. We \nhave in mind here Kopano Ratele\u201fs (2005) discussion \u2013 which itself draws on Toni \nMorrison - of the problems of \u201espeaking one\u201fs self\u201f as a black subject in a post-\napartheid setting without making reference to those words, themes and concepts that \nlocate one as a subject who is always secondary to a given racial designation. This is a \nproblem that Achille Mbembe (2002) takes up in the prioritization he places on what he \nterms \u201eAfrican modes of self-writing\u201f, that is, the making possible of certain relations to \nhistory, narration and authority which are able to acknowledge the harsh facticity of \ncolonial racism and yet to do so in a way which does not lock such African authors into \na secondary relation to Western (or white) structures of meanings and identity. This is \nalso a theme of Fanon\u201fs, and is perhaps the element that makes sections of Black Skin \nWhite Masks (1952) so difficult: the fact that in avoiding the assimilation of the master \ndiscourse of white culture he needs to fashion a new hybrid language of critique, one \nwhich emerges as an often unsettling mix of personal reminiscences, autobiographical \nanecdotes, philosophical and literary reflections. It is often neglected, in fact, the \ndegree to which sections of Black Skin White Mask are based on literary forms of \nanalysis, on the discussion of fictional treatments of colonial themes. \n The point to be made here is simply this: if the social sciences disciplines from \nwhich we speak are themselves subject to regimes of knowledge which serve \n\u201ewhiteness\u201f \u2013 a case that is made, in a slightly different manner, in much of Edward \nSaid\u201fs work, notably so in the case of Orientalism (1978) \u2013 then it becomes important \nto investigate different modes of writing, different modes of self-reflection than those \nregularized by the disciplinary social science history that we so often find ourselves \nsubject to. This, clearly, is not to forego traditional social psychological investigation, or \nsocial scientific scholarship more generally. It is though to point to the limits of our \nideological imagination within such domains, and to ask ourselves what can be \nimagined and said outside of such frames of intelligibility, and what the analytics of a \ncritical social psychology of racism and antiracism might learn from them. 2 \n \nResistance psychology, phenomenological analysis and the everyday  \nSuch terms of outside reference (the domains of fiction and popular culture) are able to \nput us into a different relation to moments of everyday experience than can be \nexpected from many current social psychological methods; here we resonate with \nDurrheim and Dixon\u201fs complaints about the lack of a suitable critical register for \naccommodating just such terms of everyday experience. Clearly we are not \nrecommending exclusive reference to the domain of fiction here; in so far as the project \nis that of capturing the terms of everyday experience \u2013 which, contrary to what is \nasserted by many discourse theorists, is not simply superceded by governing \nstructures of discourse \u2013 we might refer to a range of historical documents of everyday \nlife (see Highmore, 2002), to autobiography as method, or to a variety of community \n                                            \n2\n Paul Gilroy\u201fs (2000) extended reflections on the works of Ralph Ellison and Richard Wright \nmake for an interesting case in point here, as does Homi Bhabha\u201fs (1994) extended \nengagement with Toni Morrison and Salman Rushdie; in both cases fictional works are as \nimportant to the work of conceptualizing resistance as are more overtly scholarly or analytical \ntexts.  \n \npsychological methods such as \u201ephoto-voice\u201f (see Lykes, TerreBlanche & Hamber \n(2003) which aim to capture such moments, images and narratives. Here it is also \nworth consulting Hayes (2004), who asserts the importance of a \u201ecritical psychology of \neveryday life\u201f and offers a biting critique of how psychology typically produces a view of \nan abstract individual cut off from the concrete materiality of everyday life.  \nThis is not simply an argument about an impossibly abstracted (and, not \nincidentally, an insidiously raced) version of subjectivity that then comes to be \ngeneralized in much social psychological thinking. It is an argument about how the \nworld of everyday experience opens up moments of contradiction, juxtaposition and \nreformulation. Consider for example Said\u201fs (1993) notion of contrapuntal experience \nalong with Du Bois\u201f (1989) notion of double consciousness; these are moments of \nreflection and critique which emerge from the ordinary contexts of everyday \nexperience. Here one might also make mention of the Black Consciousness \nMovement, one aspect of which was the attempt to connect the smallest and most \n\u201eapolitical\u201f facet of daily experience to larger facts of oppression, solidarity and \nopposition (Biko, 1978). Such moments of everyday reformulation and critique, we \nwould argue, are one means of complimenting and developing the argumentative \nresources advanced by both Green & Sonn and by Kirkwood, Liu & Weatherall as \ncrucial aspects of an antiracist agenda.  \nAnother example of such a \u201eresistance psychology\u201f is worth noting here: \nChabanyi Manganyi\u201fs (1973) often autobiographical anti-apartheid text: Being-black-in-\nthe-world. This text shares with Fanon\u201fs Black Skin White Masks a commitment to a \nphenomenological mode of analysis, which, to be certain, does not necessarily consign \none to a depoliticized, perceptual, psycho- existential frame, as seems often to be \nassumed by proponents of social constructionist\/discursive approaches (Painter, \n2005). Moreover, such a perspective is also one that pushes the powerfully embodied \nnature of \u201crace\u201d and racism \u2013 a critical imperative, as emphasized by Riggs & \nAugoustinos (this issue) - to the very forefront of analytical scrutiny. Here one only \nneeds recall Fanon\u201fs (1952) pained and frequently lyrical, indeed, poetic attempts to \nillustrate the more visceral devices of racism in a materialist language of corporeal \nexperience. 3  This gives us cause to reflect on whether Social Psychology often seems \nstuck in the perspective of its current methodological preferences. Despite the obvious \npertinence of Durrheim and Dixon\u201fs commentary on the limitations of current social \npsychological instruments \u2013 which are certainly pertinent - we would suggest that the \nhistory of the discipline does offer one prospective set of tools \u2013 a politically applied \nform of phenomenological analysis, perhaps in the model supplied by Manganyi (1973) \n- that may well be up to the task of capturing the embodied, spatio-temporal practices \nof everyday lived experiences. \n \nSubjects before subjectivity \nThe body itself of course, along with questions of the psychology of embodiment \u2013 and \nquestions of embodied racialized experience \u2013 deserves far greater attention within \ncritical psychological perspectives on racism, as Riggs & Augoustinos make clear in \ntheir paper, particularly in their emphasis on epidermalization. Here then another \nFanonian problematic, usefully extended and discussed by Gilroy (2000): the \nheightened bodily sense of \u201ethe getting under the skin\u201f of racial bodily markers which \nsucceed in \u201eoverdetermining\u201f the subject \u201efrom without\u201f. This sense of how bodily \nattributes come to exert a determining influence on how identity is assembled within \nspecific socio-historical co-ordinates is particularly pertinent: it disrupts the ascendancy \nof a particular psychologistic mode of explanation that presumes an individual subject \nexisting prior to the constitutive force of social, material, bodily factors.   \n                                            \n3\n For a recent existentialist-phenomenological account that involves an incisive component of \nbodily analysis, see Gordon (1997). For a more psychoanalytic treatment of the same themes, \nsee Clarke (2002). \nIn Fanon\u201fs dedication to these factors \u2013 each of which we would argue is worth \nmore sustained attention in an antiracist critical social psychology - we have three \ninstances (the social, the bodily, materiality) in which psychology cannot be said to pre-\nempt factors of subjectification. Riggs & Augoustinos make just such an argument in \ntheir paper, pointing to a series of formative conditions \u2013 principally the subject\u201fs \nplacement in a cultural, historical and political order which precedes them \u2013 formative \nconditions which underlie and substantiate certain lines of privilege and ways of \nknowing, and from which \u201ewhiteness\u201f is all too quick to disassociate itself. \nIndividualizing psychological humanism by contrast would attempt to understand the \nperson not as subject to these forces of constitution, but rather as able to transcend \nthem. Here we need to refer back to the fabrication of the interior\/exterior distinction \nthat Butler (1997) speaks of, and indeed, the importance of grasping the psychic \ninternalisation of norms reiterated by Riggs & Augoustinos, to comprehend the \nquickness of the white subject\u201fs disavowal of the racism that is so constitutive of the \ndiscursive category \u201ewhiteness\u201f. (In this instance, so long as \u201ewhiteness\u201f is never \ndivorced from the structural racist relations that have conditioned its emergence, \nwhiteness studies does pose itself as a viable ally for a critical social psychology of \nracism).  \nIf it is the case that subjectification precedes psychological subjectivity \u2013 and \nthe most rudimentary themes of Marxist and poststructuralist analysis suggest it is -  \nthen we cannot presume an autonomous psychological individual above and beyond \nsocial\/material forces which constitute their subject-hood. For this reason critical social \npsychological forms of analysis need to be more multi-disciplinary, more multi-\nperspectival than has traditionally been the case. Whereas historically, social \npsychology has been quite willing to align itself with scientific and quantitative \nmethodological means, it has been far more tentative in its willingness to align itself \nwith current developments in social\/cultural theory, the humanities, or literary studies \n(the almost complete absence of postcolonial criticism within contemporary social \npsychology is a case in point).  This, we would argue, is not a viable route forward for a \ncritical social psychology of racism\/antiracism, which can only benefit from the \nexploration of those points of overlap shared by social psychology, critical social \nstudies, social history and so on. Here it is worth pointing out that a critical social \npsychology of racism requires, as its necessary corollary, a social psychology of \nmulticulturalism (as intimated in the introduction to this issue). Some of the most \ninteresting examples of work in this area \u2013 Said\u201fs (2003) thoughts on cosmopolitanism, \nGilroy\u201fs writing on multiculturalism after empire (2004) and planetary humanism (2000), \neven Hardt & Negri\u201fs (2005) recent musings on mass resistance to contemporary \nconditions of empire, Multitude \u2013 clearly stem from outside the disciplinary domain of \npsychology. \nThe argument for inter-disciplinary collaboration can be made even more \nstrongly: if an adequate critical engagement with racism requires a far more committed \nengagement with the forces of subjectification as mentioned above (those means of \nsubjectification that predate the psychological subject) then we must look outside of \nstandard psychological modes of analysis; to not do so would be to fail to apprehend \nwhat Butler refers to as the \u201epsychic life of power\u201f.     \n \nConclusion \nSeveral points might be made here then, in response both to under-utilized avenues for \ncritical social psychology and in respect of how it may more effectively link produce a \nform of resistance psychology. The first is simply to assert that as critical social \npsychologists we should feel less trepidation at the possibility of reference to the \nrealms of fiction, biography, popular culture and everyday experience than commonly \nseems the case. Some of the most vital currents in contemporary cultural studies \u2013 the \nanalytical usefulness in particular of notions such as performativity, hybridity and \nmimicry, habitus and field (for a succinct overview of related concepts see McRobbie, \n2005) - appear to have gone almost totally under-utilized in social psychology, a \ndiscipline which all too often appears to prefer disciplinary isolation to the prospects of \ncollaboration with cultural and social theorists, or to vital terms of reference provided by \nliterary or aesthetic domains (the work of Brown (2001), is a welcome exception to this \nrule). One might be forgiven for assuming that the cultural turn \u2013 clearly such a fulcrum \nof critique in the work of luminaries such as Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy \u2013 had passed \nsocial psychology by completely, and with it \u2013 disturbingly \u2013 a series of possibilities for \nresistance. The prospect of such collaborations between social psychological and \nsocial\/cultural theoretical perspectives affords us the opportunity to grasp something of \nthe interplay between subjectification and psychological subjectivity; this is something \nwhich for many \u2013 us included \u2013 must be considered an indispensable part of an \nantiracist agenda. \n \nReferences \nBhabha, H.
