INTRODUCTION\nAn understanding of the formation and decay of three-body\nresonance states is of increasing importance as radioactive\nbeam experiments push the boundaries of the detection of\nbound and resonant states to increasingly exotic nuclei. Two-\nneutron halo states and two-proton radioactivity are examples\nof novel three-body phenomena exhibited by such systems.\nTraditional R-matrix theory [1] assumes that three-body\nchannels make a negligible contribution to decay widths,\nin comparison with two-body channels, and is not imme-\ndiately applicable to three-body resonances. However, Lane\nand Thomas [1] proposed that three-body reactions could\nbe discussed within an R-matrix framework if treated as\ntwo, ordered two-body reactions. Barker has developed this\napproach with several applications to two-proton and two-\nneutron radioactivity [2\u20135].\nThree-body nuclei, composed of A,B, and C, are thus\nassumed to decay by one of three distinct paths, through\nintermediate states of the {AB}, {AC}, and {BC} two-body\nsystems, e.g.,\n{ABC} \u2192 {AB} + C \u2192 A + B + C,\nwith associated decay widths \u0001{AB}C , etc. If these decays\nare independent then the associated widths should simply be\nsummed to obtain the total three-body decay width of the state\n{ABC}. However, as discussed by Barker [5], the decays may\nnot be independent, in which case an estimate of the maximum\ntotal width is given by the maximally coherent sum of these\npartial widths. Barker\u2019s analyses found that, in general, the\ncalculated maximally coherent width is less than or equal to\nthe measured widths of the states [5]. Of the nuclei studied by\nBarker, only one example, the rather broad 5H system, decays\nby two-neutron emission. In that example it was found that\nthe incoherent sum was in better agreement with experiment,\ncontrary to the findings for the other nuclei. In an attempt\nto clarify this situation we consider the better understood\n2+(1.8 MeV) three-body resonance in 6He, where the interac-\ntions of the two-body subsystems have been studied in some\ndetail. We use a modified version of the approach of Barker [5].\nThe decay widths obtained are compared with the predictions\nof full, three-body dynamical calculations, using as nearly\nas possible the same underlying inputs and interactions. The\nlatter calculations make no assumptions about specific paths\nof decay.\nIn the following section the important characteristics of\nthe 6He 2+ resonance example are discussed. In Sec. III the\nR-matrix approach is introduced very briefly, as it relates to\nboth the two- and three-body systems under discussion. The\nspectroscopic factors used for the different two-body configu-\nrations are also clarified. The parameters and interactions used\nin the calculations are discussed in Sec. IV. The R-matrix\nmodel results are then discussed in Sec. V and the three-body\nmodel and its results in Sec. VI.\nII. THE 6He CASE\nThe width of the 6He, 2+(1.8 MeV) resonance was mea-\nsured [6] to be \u0001exp = 113 \u00b1 20 keV. There have also been\nseveral theoretical calculations for this system. The results\nof some of these are summarized in Table I. As is evident\nfrom Table I, none of these calculations produce a width\nconsistent with the experiment. Detailed comparisons of the\ndifferent theoretical predictions are, however, difficult to make.\nDifferences between the various model calculations result\nfrom, among other things, the use of different model-space\ntruncations and of different interactions for the system. Further,\nthe latter may or may not have been tuned to position the\nresonance energy at the measured value. For example, the large\nwidth in the case of the algebraic model of Ref. [7] is the result\nof a 2+ resonance position at 1.49 MeV (rather than 824 keV)\nabove threshold. In the present work the R-matrix description\nwill be compared with three-body calculations based on a\nhyperspherical harmonics (HH) decomposition of the wave\nfunction. Use of the HH method avoids the coherent versus\nincoherent concerns of the R-matrix method, producing the\ntotal width of the state directly. The same interactions are used\nin both calculations, as far as this is possible, to enable fair\ncomparisons.\n0556-2813\/2008\/78(5)\/054603(8) 054603-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nA.

Previous theoretical calculations of the width of the\n6He, 2+(1.8 MeV) resonance, calculated using the complex scaling\n(CSM), analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCCM),\nalgebraic model (AM) and hyperspherical harmonic (HH) methods.\nThe measured value is also shown.\n\u0001 (keV) Method Reference\n113 \u00b1 20 Experiment [6]\n60 CSM [8]\n70 ACCCM [9]\n168 AM [7]\n40 HH [10]\n\u223c60 HH [11]\nIn the R-matrix method, the 6He, 2+(1.8 MeV) decay is via\nthe following ordered two-body routes:\nI: 6He(2+) \u2192 5He(3\/2\u2212) + n \u2192 4He + n + n,\nII: 6He(2+) \u2192 4He + 2n(0+) \u2192 4He + n + n.\nPath I decays are referred to as sequential, the two neutrons\nbeing emitted one after the other. Path II decays are referred to\nas simultaneous, the neutrons being emitted together. Clearly\nthe sequential route requires a knowledge of the 5He + n\nand 5He = (4He + n) subsystems and their interactions. The\nsimultaneous route requires consideration of the 4He + 2n and\nthe n + n interactions. Similarly, the three-body HH calcula-\ntions require, in common, the 4He + n and n + n interactions.\nThe models used for these interactions are discussed later.\nThe two decay paths, their associated resonant and virtual\nstate energies, and reaction-relevant decay energies are now\ndefined in Figs. 1 and 2. Here Q2n and Q1n denote the energies\nof the three-body, 6He(2+), initial state, and the two-body\nintermediate resonance\/virtual states, respectively, measured\nrelative to the 4He + n + n threshold. The energies E and U\nare used to refer to arbitrary energies of the initial (three-body)\nand intermediate (two-body) systems, respectively. These\nenergies are also measured with respect to threshold.\nThe R-matrix methodology applied to these two decay\npathways is discussed in the following section.\nFIG. 1.

Two-body systems\nIn two-body R-matrix theory a matching radius, a, marks\nthe boundary between the internal (r \u0001 a) and external (r > a)\nregions of radial separation of the two bodies. In the internal\nregion the exact scattering wave function, \u03c8(U, r), for a two-\nbody Hamiltonian H at an energy U , is expanded in terms of\na complete set of orthonormal R-matrix eigenstates \u02dc\u03c8p(r) as\n\u03c8(U, r) =\n\u2211\np\nCp \u02dc\u03c8p(r), r \u0001 a, (1)\nwith expansion coefficients Cp. Here, the appropriate orbital\nand total angular momentum labels of the channel of interest\nare assumed but are not shown explicitly. The \u02dc\u03c8p(r), with\nenergy eigenvalues \u0003p, are the solutions of the eigenvalue\nproblem for the same two-body Hamiltonian as calculates\n\u03c8(U, r) but subject to the (R-matrix) boundary conditions\nof (a) regularity at r = 0 and (b) the logarithmic derivative\ncondition at r = a,[\n1\n\u02dc\u03c8p(r)\nd \u02dc\u03c8p\ndr\n]\nr=a\n= \u03b2 (2)\nfor a fixed \u03b2. Fixing \u03b2 renders the kinetic energy operator\nHermitian on the interval 0\u0001 r \u0001 a and ensures the orthogo-\nnality of the states \u02dc\u03c8p(r) in this range. It is usual and convenient\nto introduce a dimensionless constant b = a\u03b2. This b (with a)\ndetermines and will be referred to as the boundary condition.\nIn the single-term (one-pole) approximation, the scattering\nwave function is approximated by just the lowest (p = 1)\nnormalized R-matrix eigenstate. In this case an optimum\nchoice for b is\nb =\n[\na\n\u03c8(ER, r)\nd\u03c8(ER, r)\ndr\n]\nr=a\n, (3)\nthe logarithmic derivative (at r = a) of the exact \u03c8 evaluated\nat the two-body resonance (or virtual state) energy ER .

Spectroscopic factors\nIn Sec. VI we will discuss dynamical calculations, full con-\ntinuum solutions of the three-body Schro\u00a8dinger equation for\nthe 4He + n + n system, based on use of an HH decomposition\nof the wave function. Here, to enable best comparisons with\nthe R-matrix analyses, these HH calculations were used to\ndetermine the spectroscopic factors, S, for each decay step\nin the R-matrix calculations\u2014as required for the associated\nreduced widths in Eq. (5). These HH calculations determine\n(a) an 84% probability for the [[4He \u2297 p3\/2]3\/2\u2212 \u2297 p3\/2]2+\ncomponent of the 6He(2+) state. Thus, when multiplied by\n2 (the number of valence neutrons), this gives a value S =\n1.64 for the 6He \u2192 5He + n step, relevant to the sequential\ndecay pathway. Similarly, the [[2n(0+) \u2297 (\u0006 = 2)]2+ \u22974 He]2+\nprobability is 39% and S = 0.39 for the simultaneous, 6He \u2192\n4He + 2n step. The second, implied decay steps, 2n \u2192 n + n\nand 5He \u2192 4He + n, are taken to have spectroscopic factors\nof unity. These spectroscopic factors are collected in Table II.\nC. Three-body systems\nThe three-body decay pathways proceed through an inter-\nmediate state, being the 5He(3\/2\u2212) and 2n(0+) channels, which\ninclude the 5He(g.s.) resonance and the n + n virtual states,\nrespectively. These states are rather broad in their strength with\nrespect to the two-body relative energy variable U (of Figs. 1\nand 2). This strength distribution is described by a probability\ndensity function, \u03c1(U ). Following Lane and Thomas [1], one\ncan define \u03c1(U ) as the interior norm (IN) of the exact scattering\nwave function \u03c8(U, r) at each energy U , i.e.,\n\u03c1IN (U ) =\n\u222b a\nr=0\n|\u03c8(U, r)|2dr, (6)\nwhere, to maintain consistency with Lane and Thomas, we\nadopt the asymptotic normalizations\n\u03c8(U, r) = i\nv1\/2\n[H\u2212\u0006 (kr) \u2212 Sj\u0006H+\u0006 (kr)].

For a single channel, and in the single\nterm approximation, \u03c1(U ) can be written in the Lane and\nThomas (LT), resonance-like form [1]\n\u03c1LT(U ) = c \u00012(U )[U \u2212 Q1n \u2212 \b2(U )]2 + [\u00012(U )]2\/4 . (8)\nHere the subscripts 2 refer to the second step of the decay,\nwhich for the simultaneous case is 2n \u2192 n + n and for the\nsequential case is 5He \u2192 4He + n. The overall multiplicative\nconstant c is chosen such that, when integrated over allU, \u03c1(U )\nis normalized to unit strength. This normalization implies\nthat the intermediate state decays proceed with certainty\nsubsequent to their production in the first step. In the following,\nintegrals over U are evaluated on the range 0\u201310 MeV for the\nsequential pathway and on 0\u201320 MeV for the simultaneous\npathway. The formal width, \u00012(U ), of the second step at energy\nU is\n\u00012(U ) = 2\u03b3 22 P2(U ), (9)\nwhere P2(U ) is the penetrability,\nP2(U ) = ka\nG\u0006(ka)2 + F\u0006(ka)2 . (10)\nAlso present in Eq. (8) is the shift term \b2(U ), involving the\nreduced widths. Explicitly,\n\b2(U ) = \u2212\u03b3 22 [S2(U ) \u2212 b] , (11)\nwhere the shift function S2(U ), like the penetrability, is defined\nin terms of the regular and irregular free-particle scattering\nfunctions F\u0006 and G\u0006, as\nS2(U ) = kaG\n\u2032\n\u0006(ka)G\u0006(ka) + F \u2032\u0006(ka)F\u0006(ka)\nG\u0006(ka)2 + F\u0006(ka)2 . (12)\nHere the primes denote derivatives with respect to the\narguments of the functions (kr).\nD. R-matrix boundary conditions\nA consequence of the energy dependencies of the pene-\ntrability and shift terms in Eq. (8) is that \u03c1LT(U ) is not a\nLorentzian and hence the formal width \u00012(U ) does not trivially\ndetermine the width of \u03c1LT(U ). However, if one approximates\nthe shift function to be linear over the range of U relevant to\nthe resonance strength and uses the first two terms of its Taylor\nexpansion about the resonance position U = Q1n one obtains\na form we call the linear approximation (LA) for \u03c1(U ) that\nmore closely approximates a Lorentzian. Explicitly,\n\u03c1LA(U ) = c\u2032 \u0001\n0\n2(U )[\nU \u2212 Q1n \u2212 \b02\n]2 + [\u000102(U )]2\/4 , (13)\nwhich now contains an energy independent shift term\n\b02 =\n\u2212\u03b3 22 [S2(Q1n) \u2212 b]\n1 + \u03b3 22 dS2dU\n\u2223\u2223\nU=Q1n\n, (14)\n054603-3\nA.

(15)\nThe observed width provides a better approximation to the\nactual width of the \u03c1(U ) distribution.\nIn previous works by Barker, the R-matrix boundary\ncondition was fixed at the value b = S2(Q1n). As is clear from\nEq. (14), this choice simplifies \u03c1LA(U ), removing the \b02 shift\nterm. Specifically, one obtains what we will refer to as the\nBarker form \u03c1B(U ),\n\u03c1B(U ) = c\u2032 \u0001\n0\n2(U )\n[U \u2212 Q1n]2 +\n[\n\u000102(U )\n]2\/4 , (16)\nwith \u000102(U ) the observed width, as given above.\nAs was discussed in subsection III A, an optimum choice of\nthe derivative boundary condition in the case of the single-pole\napproximation to the R-matrix is given by Eq. (3). To calculate\nthese b it is first necessary to specify the two-body interactions\nfor the different subsystems. These are introduced in the next\nsubsection. The consistency or otherwise of the b = S2(Q1n)\nassignment, and the adequacy of the Barker approximation\nabove can then be assessed.\nIV. TWO-BODY INTERACTIONS\nWith the exception of the n + n interaction, the central\npotentials in all two-body subsystems are taken to have Woods-\nSaxon [12] forms,\nVws(r) = \u2212V0\/[1 + e(r\u2212R0)\/a0 ], (17)\nwhere V0 is the depth, R0 is the radius, and a0 the diffuseness.\nThe spin-orbit potential is defined by\nVso(r) = \u2212Vso\nasor\ne(r\u2212Rso)\/aso\n[1 + e(r\u2212Rso)\/aso ]2 . (18)\nWe use the following two-body potential parameters. For the\nsequential paths we need 4He + n and 5He + n interactions.\nFor the 4He + n system, we use the analysis of Bang and\nGignoux [13]. There, earlier p3\/2, p1\/2, and s1\/2 4He + n\nphase-shift data were fitted using a Woods-Saxon plus spin-\norbit potential. Taking as fixed the geometry of the Bang and\nGignoux potential, the program SFRESCO [14] was used to\nsearch the depths, V0 and Vso, to fit the more extensive recent\nphase-shift data [15]. Our improved potential depths are shown\nin Table III. For the 5He + n interaction the depth of our\n4He + n potential, described above, was adjusted to place the\np1\/2\n5He + n S-matrix pole at 0.06 MeV above the 5He(g.s.)\nenergy [16]; see Table III.\nFor the simultaneous decay paths we need n + n and 4He +\n2n interactions. For the n + n interaction we use a simple\nGaussian form, namely\nVnn(r) = \u2212V0 exp[\u2212(r\/R0)2]. (19)\nThe depth and range, given in Table III, parametrize the\nlow-energy scattering, and the virtual state at \u22120.12 MeV,\nof two neutrons in a relative s state [17].

The dineutron potential\nwas too deep and the deuteron potential too shallow.\nThe two potential depths were thus tuned to put\nthe resonance in the right position. The resulting\nparameters are shown in Table III.\n(iii) We describe the 4He + 2n interaction based on the\nfolding of the n + 4He interactions with an extended,\nnormalized continuum bin relative motion wave func-\ntion for the two neutrons interacting via the Gaussian\nn + n potential described above. The relative s-wave\nbin state wave function, \u03c6nn(r), was constructed with\nn + n relative energies from 0 to 2 MeV. Thus, Vbin is\nVbin(r) = \u3008\u03c6nn|Vn\u03b1(r1) + Vn\u03b1(r2)|\u03c6nn\u3009, (20)\nwhere r1 and r2, are the two n + 4He separations. For\nconvenience this bin potential was fitted with a Woods-Saxon\nform, Table III, and its depth was adjusted as discussed\nabove to position the 4He + 2n resonance in relative d waves.\nAs is evident from Table III these three potentials give a\nrange of potential geometries and will allow an assessment\n054603-4\nR-MATRIX AND DYNAMICAL MODEL CALCULATIONS . . .

R-MATRIX MODEL RESULTS\nWe first return to our discussion of the R-matrix boundary\nconditions of subsection III D. As was discussed there, in the\none-term approximation the choice of the derivative boundary\ncondition b affects the form of the \u03c1(U ). The optimum choice\nof b in this case was stated in Eq. (3).\nWe used the value a = 7 fm for all two-body systems,\nexcept n + n for which a = 5 fm. These values were chosen\nsuch that we obtained converged (with a) S-matrix pole\npositions in the complex energy plane for the 5He(3\/2\u2212)\nchannel resonance and for the n + n virtual state. For example,\nFig. 3 shows the convergence of the calculated resonance\nenergy ER (closed circles) and width \u0001 of the 5He(3\/2\u2212)\nground state as a function of the assumed channel radius. The\noptimal b were determined (for each two-body interaction)\nfrom \u03c8(ER, r), with ER the (real part of the) energy of the\nappropriate S-matrix pole, located precisely through scans\nof the complex energy (and\/or k) plane. For the 4He + n\ninteraction ER = 0.77 MeV above threshold and b = \u22120.2.\nThe s-wave virtual state pole of the n + n interaction had\nER = \u22120.121 MeV and b = 0.27. Table IV shows that, for\nboth our sequential and simultaneous decays, this optimal b\nis significantly different from the b = S2(Q1n) Barker choice.\nTABLE IV. Comparison of the boundary conditions b for the\n4He + n and the n + n systems calculated from the exact wave\nfunctions using Eq.

All b are collected in Table III.\nA. Probability density functions\nFigure 4 shows the 5He probability density functions \u03c1(U )\ncalculated directly from the interior norm of the scattering\nwave function (IN), Eq. (6), the Lane and Thomas form (LT),\nEq. (8), and the linear approximation (LA), Eq. (13). The\nIN curve exhibits a high-energy tail, absent from the LT and\nLA approximations, attributable to the use of the single-pole\napproximation in the formulation of the latter. Having omitted\nthe p > 1 poles and normalized \u03c1(U ) to unity, we have forced\nthe decay through the resonance without the higher-energy\npole contributions.\nFigure 5 shows the calculated n + n probability density\nfunctions for the simultaneous decay route. The figure shows\nthe failure of the linear approximation (LA), Eq. (13), in this\ncase compared to the\u03c1IN calculated directly from the scattering\nwave functions, Eq. (6). This is not unexpected. Because for\nrelative s waves the shift function is negative for negative U\nand vanishes for positive U , the linear (Taylor) approximation\nabout Q1n = \u22120.121 MeV is a poor representation for all\npositive U . In the s-wave n + n case, a better approximation\nis to set the shift function to zero, which we denote \u03c1ZS(U ). In\nthis case\n\u03c1ZS(U ) = c \u00012(U )(\nU \u2212 Q1n \u2212 \u03b3 22 b\n)2 + [\u00012(U )]2\/4 .

Sequential, simultaneous, and total widths\nThe total observed widths, \u00010tot, of each of the decay\npathways taken individually, from an initial state with three-\nbody energy E above threshold, is given (see, e.g., Ref. [5])\nby the weighted integral over intermediate state energies\n\u00010tot(E) =\n\u222b E\n0\n\u000101(E,U )\u03c1(U )dU. (22)\nHere, subscript 1 now indicates quantities associated with the\nfirst step of the decay that is 6He \u2192 5He + n (sequential) and\n6He \u2192 4He + 2n (simultaneous) and the observed width of\nthe first step, \u000101, having made the linear approximation, is\n\u000101(E,U ) =\n\u00011(E,U )\n1 + \u03b3 21\n\u222b\u221e\n0 [dS1(E \u2212 U )\/dE]E=Q2n\u03c1(U )dU\n.\n(23)\nThe formal width of the first step, \u00011, is\n\u00011(E,U ) = 2\u03b3 21 P1(E \u2212 U ). (24)\nAll elements of these formulas have been defined previously.\nWe calculate the widths \u00010tot(Q2n) where the three-body energy\nis that of the 6He(2+) resonance, 0.824 MeV. The calculations\npresented below used \u03c1LA(U ) and \u03c1ZS(U ) for the sequential\nand simultaneous paths, respectively.\nTable V shows the total R-matrix widths for the sequen-\ntial and simultaneous paths. The sequential width, \u00010seq =\n34.8 keV, is more than a factor of 3 greater than our largest\nestimate of the simultaneous width. Thus, we can already\nconclude that the sequential route is the dominant decay\nTABLE V. Sequential and simultaneous widths (in keV) for the\ndecay of the 6He(2+) resonance.

For the simultaneous path, the point dineutron and\n4He + d potentials give smaller widths than the bin potential.\nWe observe a significant correlation between the simultaneous\nwidths and the depth and diffuseness of the assumed 4He + 2n\ninteraction. Neither of the two separate widths is comparable\nto the \u0001exp = 113 \u00b1 20 keV value. Their combination, and\npossible coherence, is therefore an important issue.\nIn the conventional two-body R-matrix theory [1], partial\nwidths of different decay channels, c, are simply summed\n(incoherently) to \u0001inc. However, as was discussed by Barker\n[5], combining partial widths of three-body decay paths is\nless clear. Allowing for interference between the channels, the\nmaximum possible (coherent) total width\u0001coh is the maximally\ncoherent sum. These are:\n\u0001inc =\n\u2211\nc\n\u00010c , \u0001coh =\n[\u2211\nc\n(\u00010c )1\/2\n]2\n. (25)\nTable VI shows the \u0001inc and \u0001coh resulting from the 6He decay\npaths, calculated using the three model 4He + 2n potentials.\nThe maximally coherent sum is in better agreement with \u0001exp.\nThis result is in agreement with the findings of Barker in the\nmajority of cases studied, e.g., Ref. [5].\nVI. THREE-BODY DYNAMICAL CALCULATIONS\nOnly the most pertinent points and parameters of these\nthree-body calculations are discussed here. The details of\nthe HH technique for the solution of the three-body problem\ncan be found in Refs. [21\u201323]. The model calculations were\nperformed using the programs EFADDY [24] and STURMXX [25]\ndeveloped by Thompson et al. The three-body HH calculations\nuse the same fixed n + n and 4He + n potentials as in the\nR-matrix calculations. In addition, however, the HH model\nalso includes a small, central hyperradial three-body potential,\nV3B , of the form [21],\nV3B(\u03c1r ) = V 03B\/[1 + (\u03c1r\/\u03c10)3]. (26)\nThis potential, a function only of the hyperradius, \u03c1r , has a\nrange determined by \u03c10. This value is typically of order 5 fm.\nThis range having been fixed, the depth, V 03B was tuned to place\nthe 6He(2+) state at 0.824 MeV to ensure fair comparison with\nthe R-matrix results. Pauli blocking of occupied core states\nwas taken into account using (i) a repulsive potential in the\ns-wave 4He + n subsystem and (ii) Pauli projection operators\n[23], which project the forbidden states to a large positive\nenergy. The results using the two methods agreed within 1%.\nUsing the HH terminology [25], a maximum hypermomentum\n054603-6\nR-MATRIX AND DYNAMICAL MODEL CALCULATIONS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 78, 054603 (2008)\nof Kmax = 30, a maximum hyperradius \u03c1max = 30 fm and a\nmaximum number of basis functions ofQ = 25 were sufficient\nto obtain converged HH calculations in the 6He(2+) case. For\nthese converged calculations the value of V 03B is \u22120.34 MeV.\nThe three-body decay width, \u00013B , was extracted here from\nthe HH calculations through the sum of the eigenphases,\n\u03b4k(E). These were calculated from the eigenvalues Sk(E) =\nexp[2i\u03b4k(E)] of the unitary, multichannel S-matrix. Following\nHazi [26], the width is then extracted from the sum of the\neigenphases, \b(E) = \u2211k \u03b4k(E) by use of the usual resonance\nrelationship,\n2\n\u00013B\n= d\b(E)\ndE\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\nQ2n\n. (27)\nThe total three-body width calculated this way is \u00013B =\n71.6 keV; however this value is rather robust when obtained\nfrom different prescriptions. The 2+ channel strength distribu-\ntions in the region of the 2+ resonance, calculated using three\nmethods, are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of the three-body\nenergy E of the 4He + n + n system. The curves show the\ndistributions calculated using (a) the derivatives of the sum\nof the eigenphases, of Eq. (27) above, with the solid points\nand dashed curve, (b) the interior norms (for radii less than\n10 fm) of the three-body wave functions with the dot-dashed\ncurve, and (c) the B(E2) strength distribution (per MeV) for\nelectromagnetic excitations of the 2+ continuum from the 6He\nground-state with the solid curve. As is clear, the deduced\nwidths from these three approaches are in good agreement.\nA.

To maintain the\n2+ resonance at the correct energy, and to exclude n + n\ncorrelations at large distance, the three-body interaction was\nalso adjusted. Specifically, its radius was reduced to \u03c10 =\n2.0 fm and the strength required was now V 03B = \u221215.1 MeV.\nThis returned an estimate for the sequential width of \u0001seq =\n46.5 keV that compares reasonably with the R-matrix se-\nquential width of \u00010seq = 34.8 keV, given that one cannot\nfully remove the two-neutron correlations in the three-body\nframework.\nVII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nA summary of the calculated 6He, 2+(1.8 MeV) three-body\nresonance widths from the R-matrix and dynamical models is\npresented in Fig. 7. The experimental value, \u0001exp = 113 \u00b1\n20 keV is indicated by the solid line and the associated\nerrors by the dashed horizontal lines. As has been made clear,\nall calculations have had their interactions tuned so as to\nposition the resonance, allowing a direct comparison of the\nresulting widths. All of the theoretical calculations fall short\nof the experimental value. The maximally coherent sum of\nthe R-matrix partial widths is in better agreement with the\ndynamical three-body width. Our R-matrix and dynamical\ncalculation results for the widths agree reasonably well with\nthose examples from the literature that predict the position of\nthe 2+ resonance appropriately, as are given in Table I. The\nlarge width from the algebraic model was discussed already in\nSec. II.\nIn summary, R-matrix and dynamical three-body calcu-\nlations of the width of the 6He, 2+(1.8 MeV) three-body\nresonance were performed.
