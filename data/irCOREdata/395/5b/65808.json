INTRODUCTION\nThe absorption probability and the propagation speed\nof polarized light propagating in a magnetic field depends\non the relative orientation between the polarization and\nthe magnetic field. These effects are known as vacuum\nmagnetic dichroism and birefringence, respectively, re-\nsulting from fluctuation-induced vacuum polarization.\nIn a pioneering experiment, the BFRT collaboration\nsearched for these effects by shining linearly polarized\nlaser photons through a superconducting dipole magnet.\nNo significant signal was found, and a corresponding up-\nper limit was placed on the rotation (dichroism) and el-\nlipticity (birefringence) of the photon beam developed\nafter passage through the magnetic field [1, 2].\nRecently, however, a follow-up experiment done by the\nPVLAS collaboration reported the observation of a ro-\ntation of the polarization plane of light after its passage\nthrough a transverse magnetic field in vacuum [3]. More-\nover, preliminary results presented by the PVLAS collab-\noration at various seminars and conferences hint also at\nthe observation of an ellipticity (birefringence) [4, 5].\nThese findings have initiated a number of theoreti-\ncal and experimental activities, since the magnitude of\nthe reported signals exceeds the standard-model expec-\ntations by far.1 If the observed effects are indeed true\n\u2217Electronic address: markus.ahlers@desy.de\n\u2020Electronic address: h.gies@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de\n\u2021Electronic address: joerg.jaeckel@durham.ac.uk\n\u00a7Electronic address: andreas.ringwald@desy.de\n1 The incompatibility with standard QED has recently been con-\nsignals of vacuum magnetic dichroism and birefringence\nand not due to a subtle, yet unidentified systematic ef-\nfect, they signal new physics beyond the standard model\nof particle physics.\nOne obvious possible explanation, and indeed the one\nwhich was also a motivation for the BFRT and PVLAS\nexperiments, may be offered by the existence of a new\nlight neutral spin-0 boson \u03c6 [9]. In fact, this possibility\nhas been studied in Ref. [3], with the conclusion that the\nrotation observed by PVLAS can be reconciled with the\nnon-observation of a rotation and ellipticity by BFRT, if\nthe hypothetical neutral boson has a mass in the range\nm\u03c6 \u223c (1 \u2212 1.5) meV and a coupling to two photons in\nthe range g \u223c (1.7\u2212 5.0)\u00d7 10\u22126 GeV\u22121.\nClearly, these values almost certainly exclude the pos-\nsibility that \u03c6 is a genuine QCD axion A [10, 11]. For\nthe latter, a mass mA \u223c 1meV implies a Peccei-Quinn\nsymmetry [12, 13] breaking scale fA \u223c 6 \u00d7 109GeV.\nSince, for an axion, g \u223c \u03b1|E\/N |\/(2\u03c0fA) [14, 15, 16],\none would need an extremely large ratio |E\/N | \u223c 3\u00d7107\nof electromagnetic and color anomalies in order to ar-\nrive at an axion-photon coupling in the range suggested\nby PVLAS. This is far away from the predictions of\nany model conceived so far. Moreover, such a new,\naxion-like particle (ALP) must have very peculiar prop-\nerties [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] in order to evade the strong\nconstraints on its two photon coupling from stellar en-\nfirmed again in a more careful wave-propagation study which\nalso takes the rotation of the magnetic field in the PVLAS setup\nproperly into account [6, 7]. The proposal of a potential QED\neffect in the rotating magnetic field [8] is therefore ruled out.\n2ergy loss considerations [23] and from its non-observation\nin helioscopes such as the CERN Axion Solar Telescope\n(CAST) [24]. A light scalar boson is furthermore con-\nstrained by upper limits on non-Newtonian forces [25].\nRecently, an alternative to the ALP interpretation of\nthe PVLAS results was proposed [26]. It is based on\nthe observation that the photon-initiated real and vir-\ntual pair production of millicharged particles (MCPs) \u01eb\u00b1\nin an external magnetic field would also manifest itself as\na vacuum magnetic dichroism and ellipticity. In partic-\nular, it was pointed out that the dichroism observed by\nPVLAS may be compatible with the non-observation of\na dichroism and ellipticity by BFRT, if the millicharged\nparticles have a small mass m\u01eb \u223c 0.1 eV and a tiny frac-\ntional electric charge \u01eb \u2261 Q\u01eb\/e \u223c 10\u22126. As has been\nshown recently [20], such particles may be consistent with\nastrophysical and cosmological bounds (for a review, see\nRef. [27]), if their tiny charge arises from gauge kinetic\nmixing of the standard model hypercharge U(1) with ad-\nditional U(1) gauge factors from physics beyond the stan-\ndard model [28]. This appears to occur quite naturally\nin string theory [29].\nIt is very comforting that a number of laboratory-based\nlow-energy tests of the ALP and MCP interpretation of\nthe PVLAS anomaly are currently set up and expected\nto yield decisive results within the upcoming year. For\ninstance, the Q&A experiment has very recently released\nfirst rotation data [30]. Whereas the Q&A experimental\nsetup is qualitatively similar to PVLAS, the experiment\noperates in a slightly different parameter region; here, no\nanomalous signal has been detected so far.\nThe interpretation of the PVLAS signal involving an\nALP that interacts weakly with matter will crucially be\ntested by photon regeneration (sometimes called \u201clight\nshining through walls\u201d) experiments [31, 32, 33, 34, 35,\n36, 37] presently under construction or serious consider-\nation [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. In these experiments\n(cf. Fig. 1), a photon beam is shone across a magnetic\nfield, where a fraction of them turns into ALPs. The\nALP beam can then propagate freely through a wall or\nanother obstruction without being absorbed, and finally\nanother magnetic field located on the other side of the\nwall can transform some of these ALPs into photons \u2014\nseemingly regenerating these photons out of nothing. An-\nother probe could be provided by direct astrophysical ob-\nservations of light rays traversing a pulsar magnetosphere\nin binary pulsar systems [45].\nClearly, photon regeneration will be negligible for\nMCPs. Their existence, however, can be tested by im-\nproving the sensitivity of instruments for the detection of\nvacuum magnetic birefringence and dichroism [2, 3, 30,\n38, 43, 46]. Another sensitive tool is Schwinger pair pro-\nduction in strong electric fields, as they are available, for\nexample, in accelerator cavities [47]. A classical probe\nfor MCPs is the search for invisible orthopositronium de-\ncays [48, 49], for which new experiments are currently\nrunning [50] or being developed [51, 52].\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the two scenarios are\n\u03b3laser\u03b3laser\n\u2212\u2192\nB\n\u2212\u2192\nB\n\u03c6\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of a \u201clight shining through a wall\u201d\nexperiment. (Pseudo-)scalar production through photon con-\nversion in a magnetic field (left), subsequent travel through a\nwall, and final detection through photon regeneration (right).\nsubstantially different: the ALP scenario is parameter-\nized by an effective non-renormalizable dimension-5 oper-\nator, the stabilization of which almost inevitably requires\nan underlying theory at a comparatively low scale, say in\nbetween the electroweak and the GUT scale. By contrast,\nthe MCP scenario in its simplest version is reminiscent to\nQED; it is perturbatively renormalizable and can remain\na stable microscopic theory over a wide range of scales.\nThe present paper is devoted to an investigation of\nthe characteristic properties of the different scenarios in\nthe light of all available data collected so far. A careful\nstudy of the optical properties of the magnetized vacuum\ncan indeed reveal important information about masses,\ncouplings and other quantum numbers of the potentially\ninvolved hypothetical particles. This is quantitatively\ndemonstrated by global fits to all published data. For\nfurther illustrative purposes, we also present global fits\nwhich include the preliminary data made available by\nthe PVLAS collaboration at workshops and conferences.\nWe stress that this data is only used here to qualitatively\ndemonstrate how the optical measurements can be associ-\nated with particle-physics properties. Definite quantita-\ntive predictions have to await the outcome of a currently\nperformed detailed data analysis of the PVLAS collabo-\nration. Still, the resulting fit regions can be viewed as a\npreliminary estimate of \u201ctarget regions\u201d for the various\nlaboratory tests mentioned above. Moreover, the statis-\ntical analysis is also meant to help the theorists in de-\nciding whether they should care at all about the PVLAS\nanomaly, and, if yes, whether there is a pre-selection of\nphenomenological models or model building blocks that\ndeserve to be studied in more detail.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next sec-\ntion II we summarize the signals for vacuum magnetic\ndichroism and birefringence in presence of axion-like and\nmillicharged particles. We use these results in Sec. III\nto show how the different scenarios can be distinguished\nfrom each other and how information about the quan-\ntum numbers of the potential particle candidates can be\ncollected. In Sec. IV we then perform a statistical anal-\nysis including all current data. We also use preliminary\nPVLAS data to show the prospects for the near future.\nWe summarize our conclusions in Sec. V.\n3II. VACUUM MAGNETIC DICHROISM,\nBIREFRINGENCE, AND PHOTON\nREGENERATION\nWe start here with some general kinematic considera-\ntions relevant to dichroism and birefringence, which are\nequally valid for the case of ALP and the case of MCP\nproduction.\nLet ~k be the momentum of the incoming photon, with\n|~k| = \u03c9, and let ~B be a static homogeneous magnetic\nfield, which is perpendicular to ~k, as it is the case in all\nof the afore-mentioned polarization experiments.\nThe photon-initiated production of an ALP with mass\nm\u03c6 or an MCP with mass m\u01eb, leads, for \u03c9 > m\u03c6 or\n\u03c9 > 2m\u01eb, respectively, to a non-trivial ratio of the sur-\nvival probabilities exp(\u2212\u03c0\u2016,\u22a5(\u2113)) of a photon after it has\ntraveled a distance \u2113, for photons polarized parallel \u2016 or\nperpendicular \u22a5 to ~B. This non-trivial ratio manifests\nitself directly in a dichroism: for a linearly polarized pho-\nton beam, the angle \u03b8 between the initial polarization\nvector and the magnetic field will change to \u03b8+\u2206\u03b8 after\npassing a distance \u2113 through the magnetic field, with\ncot(\u03b8 +\u2206\u03b8) =\nE\u2016\nE\u22a5\n=\nE0\u2016\nE0\u22a5\nexp\n(\n\u22121\n2\n(\u03c0\u2016(\u2113)\u2212 \u03c0\u22a5(\u2113))\n)\n.\n(1)\nHere, E\u2016,\u22a5 are the electric field components of the laser\nparallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field,\nand the superscript \u201c0\u201d denotes initial values. For small\nrotation angle \u2206\u03b8, we have\n\u2206\u03b8 \u2243 1\n4\n(\u03c0\u2016 \u2212 \u03c0\u22a5) sin(2\u03b8). (2)\nWe will present the results for the probability exponents\n\u03c0\u2016\u2212\u03c0\u22a5 for ALPs and MCPs in the following subsections.\nLet us now turn to birefringence. The propagation\nspeed of the laser photons is slightly changed in the\nmagnetic field owing to the coupling to virtual ALPs\nor MCPs. Accordingly, the time \u03c4\u2016,\u22a5(\u2113) it takes for a\nphoton to traverse a distance \u2113 differs for the two po-\nlarization modes, causing a phase difference between the\ntwo modes,\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c9(\u03c4\u2016(\u2113)\u2212 \u03c4\u22a5(\u2113)). (3)\nThis induces an ellipticity \u03c8 of the outgoing beam,\n\u03c8 =\n\u03c9\n2\n(\u03c4\u2016(\u2113)\u2212 \u03c4\u22a5(\u2113)) sin(2\u03b8), for \u03c8 \u226a 1. (4)\nAgain, we will present the results for \u03c4\u2016 \u2212 \u03c4\u22a5 for ALPs\nand MCPs in the following subsections.\nA. Production of Neutral Spin-0 Bosons\nA neutral spin-0 particle can interact with two photons\nvia\nL(+)int = \u2212\n1\n4\ng\u03c6(+)F\u00b5\u03bdF\n\u00b5\u03bd =\n1\n2\ng\u03c6(+)( ~E2 \u2212 ~B2), (5)\nif it is a scalar, or\nL(\u2212)int = \u2212\n1\n4\ng\u03c6(\u2212)F\u00b5\u03bd F\u02dc\n\u00b5\u03bd = g\u03c6(\u2212)( ~E \u00b7 ~B), (6)\nif it is a pseudoscalar. In a homogeneous magnetic back-\nground ~B, the leading order contribution to the conver-\nsion (left half of Fig. 1) of (pseudo-)scalars into photons\ncomes from the terms \u223c ~B2 and \u223c ~E \u00b7 ~B, respectively.\nThe polarization of a photon is now given by the di-\nrection of the electric field of the photon, ~E\u03b3 , whereas\nits magnetic field, ~B\u03b3 is perpedicular to the polariza-\ntion. Therefore, only those fields polarized perpendicu-\nlar (parallel) to the background magnetic field will have\nnonvanishing ~B\u03b3 \u00b7 ~B 6= 0 ( ~E\u03b3 \u00b7 ~B 6= 0) and interact with\nthe (pseudo-)scalar particles. Accordingly, for scalars we\nhave,\n\u03c0\n(+)\n\u22a5 6= 0, \u03c0(+)\u2016 = 0, \u03c4\n(+)\n\u22a5 6= 0, \u03c4 (+)\u2016 = 0 (7)\nwhereas for pseudoscalars we find\n\u03c0\n(\u2212)\n\u22a5 = 0, \u03c0\n(\u2212)\n\u2016 6= 0, \u03c4\n(\u2212)\n\u22a5 = 0, \u03c4\n(\u2212)\n\u2016 6= 0. (8)\nApart from this, the interaction is identical in lowest or-\nder,\n\u03c0\n(+)\n\u22a5 = \u03c0\n(\u2212)\n\u2016 and \u03c4\n(+)\n\u22a5 = \u03c4\n(\u2212)\n\u2016 . (9)\nUsing Eqs. (1)-(4) we deduce\n\u2206\u03b8(+) = \u2212\u2206\u03b8(\u2212), and \u03c8(+) = \u2212\u03c8(\u2212). (10)\nWe can now summarize the predictions on the rotation\n\u2206\u03b8 and the ellipticity \u03c8 in (pseudo-)scalar ALP mod-\nels with coupling g and mass m\u03c6 [9, 53]. We assume a\nsetup as in the BFRT experiment with a dipole magnet\nof length L and homogeneous magnetic field B. The po-\nlarization of the laser beam with photon energy \u03c9 has an\nangle \u03b8 relative to the magnetic field. The effective num-\nber of passes of photons in the dipole is Npass. Due to\ncoherence, the rotation \u2206\u03b8 and ellipticity \u03c8 depend non-\nlinearly on the length of the apparatus L and linearly on\nthe number of passes Npass, instead of simply being pro-\nportional to \u2113 = NpassL; whereas the photon component\nis reflected at the cavity mirrors, the ALP component is\nnot and leaves the cavity after each pass:\n\u2212\u2206\u03b8(+) = \u2206\u03b8(\u2212) = Npass\n(\ngB\u03c9\nm2\u03c6\n)2\nsin2\n(\nLm2\u03c6\n4\u03c9\n)\nsin 2\u03b8,\n(11)\n4\u2212 \u03c8(+) = \u03c8(\u2212) (12)\n=\nNpass\n2\n(\ngB\u03c9\nm2\u03c6\n)2(\nLm2\u03c6\n2\u03c9\n\u2212 sin\n(\nLm2\u03c6\n2\u03c9\n))\nsin 2\u03b8.\nFor completeness, we present here also the flux of re-\ngenerated photons in a \u201clight-shining through a wall\u201d\nexperiment (cf. Fig. 1). In the case of a pseudoscalar, it\nreads\nN\u02d9 (\u2212)\u03b3 reg = N\u02d90\n\u230a\nNpass + 1\n2\n\u230b\n1\n16\n(gBL cos \u03b8)\n4\n\uf8eb\uf8edsin(Lm2\u03c64\u03c9 )\nLm2\n\u03c6\n4\u03c9\n\uf8f6\uf8f84 ,\n(13)\nwhere N\u02d90 is the original photon flux. For a scalar, the\ncos \u03b8 is replaced by a sin \u03b8. Equation (13) is for the special\nsituation in which a dipole of length L and field ~B is used\nfor generation as well as for regeneration of the ALPs as\nit is the case for the BFRT experiment. Note that only\npasses towards the wall count.\nB. Optical Vacuum Properties from\nCharged-Particle Fluctuations\nLet us now consider the interactions between the laser\nbeam and the magnetic field mediated by fluctuations of\nparticles with charge \u01ebe and mass m\u01eb. For laser frequen-\ncies above threshold, \u03c9 > 2m\u01eb, pair production becomes\npossible in the magnetic field, resulting in a depletion of\nthe incoming photon amplitude. The corresponding pho-\nton attenuation coefficients \u03ba\u2016,\u22a5 for the two polarization\nmodes are related to the probability exponents \u03c0\u2016,\u22a5 by\n\u03c0\u2016,\u22a5 = \u03ba\u2016,\u22a5 \u2113, (14)\ndepending linearly on the optical path length \u2113. Also the\ntime \u03c4\u2016,\u22a5 it takes for the photon to traverse the inter-\naction region with the magnetic field exhibits the same\ndependence,\n\u03c4\u2016,\u22a5 = n\u2016,\u22a5 \u2113, (15)\nwhere n\u2016,\u22a5 denotes the refractive indices of the magne-\ntized vacuum.\n1. Dirac Fermions\nWe begin with vacuum polarization and pair produc-\ntion of charged Dirac fermions [26], arising from an in-\nteraction Lagrangian\nLDspint = \u01eb e \u03c8\u01eb\u03b3\u00b5\u03c8\u01ebA\u00b5, (16)\nwith \u03c8\u01eb being a Dirac spinor (\u201cDsp\u201d).\nExplicit expressions for the photon absorption coeffi-\ncients \u03ba\u2016,\u22a5 can be inferred from the polarization tensor\nwhich is obtained by integrating over the fluctuations of\nthe \u03c8\u01eb field. This process \u03b3 \u2192 \u01eb+\u01eb\u2212 has been studied fre-\nquently in the literature for the case of a homogeneous\nmagnetic field [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]:\n\u03c0Dsp\u2016,\u22a5 \u2261 \u03baDsp\u2016,\u22a5 \u2113 =\n1\n2\n\u01eb3e\u03b1\nB\u2113\nm\u01eb\nTDsp\u2016,\u22a5 (\u03c7) (17)\n= 1.09\u00d7 106 \u01eb3\n(\neV\nm\u01eb\n)(\nB\nT\n)(\n\u2113\nm\n)\nTDsp\u2016,\u22a5 (\u03c7),\nwhere \u03b1 = e2\/4\u03c0 is the fine-structure constant.

Spin-0 Bosons\nThe optical properties of a magnetized vacuum can\nalso be influenced by fluctuations of charged spin-0\nbosons. The corresponding interaction Lagrangian is\nthat of scalar QED (index \u201csc\u201d),\nLsc = \u2212|D\u00b5(\u01ebeA)\u03d5\u01eb|2 \u2212m2\u01eb |\u03d5\u01eb|2, D\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5 \u2212 i\u01ebeA\u00b5,\n(25)\nwith \u03d5\u01eb being a complex scalar field. The induced optical\nproperties have not been explicitly computed before in\nthe literature, but can be inferred straightforwardly from\nthe polarization tensor found in [65]. As derived in more\ndetail in appendices A and B, the corresponding results\nfor dichroism and birefringence are similar to the familiar\nDirac fermion case,\n\u03c0sc\u2016,\u22a5 \u2261 \u03basc\u2016,\u22a5\u2113 =\n1\n2\n\u01eb3e\u03b1\nB\u2113\nm\u01eb\nT sc\u2016,\u22a5(\u03c7), (26)\nwhere\nT sc\u2016,\u22a5 =\n2\n\u221a\n3\n\u03c0\u03c7\n1\u222b\n0\ndv K2\/3\n(\n4\n\u03c7\n1\n1\u2212 v2\n)\n\u00d7\n[(\n1\n3v\n2\n)\n\u2016\n,\n(\n1\n2 \u2212 16v2\n)\n\u22a5\n]\n(1\u2212 v2) (27)\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\n1\n2\n\u221a\n3\n2 e\n\u22124\/\u03c7\n[\n(0)\u2016, (\n1\n4 )\u22a5\n]\nfor \u03c7\u226a 1 ,\n\u03c0\n\u0393( 16 )\u0393(\n13\n6 )\n\u03c7\u22121\/3\n[\n(16 )\u2016, (\n1\n2 )\u22a5\n]\nfor \u03c7\u226b 1 .\nThe zero coefficient in Eq. (27) holds, of course, only to\nleading order in this calculation. We observe that the \u22a5\nmode dominates absorption in the scalar case in contrast\nto the spinor case. Hence, the induced rotation of the\nlaser probe goes into opposite directions in the two cases,\nbosons and fermions.\nThe refractive indices induced by scalar fluctuations\nread\nnsc\u2016,\u22a5 = 1\u2212\n\u01eb2\u03b1\n4\u03c0\n(\n\u01eb eB\nm2\u01eb\n)2\nIsc\u2016,\u22a5(\u03c7), (28)\nwith\nIsc\u2016,\u22a5(\u03c7)=\n2\n1\n3\n2\n(\n3\n\u03c7\n) 4\n3\n\u222b 1\n0\ndv\n[(\nv2\n3\n)\n\u2016\n,\n(\n1\n2 \u2212 v\n2\n6\n)\n\u22a5\n]\n(1\u2212 v2) 13\n\u00d7e\u02dc\u20320\n[\n\u2212\n\u201c\n6\n\u03c7\n1\n1\u2212v2\n\u201d 2\n3\n]\n(29)\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\u2212\n1\n90\n[\n(1)\u2016, (7)\u22a5\n]\nfor \u03c7\u226a 1 ,\n9\n14\n\u03c0\n1\n2 2\n1\n3 (\u0393( 23 ))\n2\n\u0393( 16 )\n\u03c7\u22124\/3\n[\n(12 )\u2016, (\n3\n2 )\u22a5\n]\nfor \u03c7\u226b 1 .\nAgain, the polarization dependence of the refractive in-\ndices renders the magnetized vacuum birefringent. We\nobserve that the induced ellipticities for the scalar and\nthe spinor case go into opposite directions. In particu-\nlar, for small \u03c7, the \u22a5 mode is slower for the scalar case,\nsupporting an ellipticity signal which has the same sign\nas that of Nitrogen2. For the spinor case, it is the other\nway round. As a nontrivial cross-check of our results for\nthe scalar case, note that the refractive indices for \u03c7\u226a 1\nprecisely agree with the (inverse) velocities computed in\nEqs. (A12) and (A13) from the Heisenberg-Euler effective\naction of scalar QED.\nWe conclude that a careful determination of the signs\nof ellipticity and rotation in the case of a positive sig-\nnal can distinguish between spinor and scalar fluctuating\nparticles.3\nFinally, let us briefly comment on the case of having\nboth fermions and bosons. If there is an identical num-\nber of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom with ex-\nactly the same masses and millicharges, i.e. if the mil-\nlicharged particles appear in a supersymmetric fashion\nin complete supersymmetric chiral multiplets, one can\ncheck that the signals cancel. An exactly supersymmet-\nric set of millicharged particles would cause neither an el-\nlipticity signal nor a rotation of the polarization and one\nwould have to rely on other detection principles as, for ex-\nample, Schwinger pair production in accelerator cavities\n[47]. However, in nature supersymmetry is broken result-\ning in different masses for bosons and fermions. Now, the\n2 The sign of an ellipticity signal can actively be checked with a\nresidual-gas analysis. Filling the cavity with a gas with a known\nclassical Cotton-Mouton effect of definite sign, this effect can\ninterfere constructively or destructively with the quantum effect,\nleading to characteristic residual-gas pressure dependencies of\nthe total signal [4, 5].\n3 In the sense of classical optics, the ellipticities of the various\nscenarios discussed here are indeed associated with a definite\nand unambiguous sign. This is not the case for the sign of the\nrotation which also depends on the experimental set up: in all\nour scenarios, the polarization axis is rotated towards the mode\nwith the smallest probability exponent pi in Eq. (2). In the sense\nof classical optics, this can be either sign depending on the initial\nphoton polarization relative to the magnetic field. In this work,\nthe notion of the sign of rotation therefore refers to the two\nexperimentally distinguishable cases of either pi\u2016 > pi\u22a5 or pi\u2016 <\npi\u22a5.\n6signal typically decreases rather rapidly for large masses\n(more precisely when \u03c7 \u223c 1\/m3\u01eb becomes smaller than\none) and the lighter particle species will give a much\nbigger contribution. Accordingly, for a sufficiently large\nmass splitting the signal would look more or less as if we\nhad only the lighter particle species, be it a fermion or a\nboson.\nIII. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT\nSCENARIOS\nIn principle, one can set up a series of different ex-\nperiments distinguishing between the different scenarios,\nALPs or MCPs. For example, a positive signal in a light-\nshining-through-wall experiment [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,\n37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] would be a clear signal for\nthe ALP interpretation, whereas detection of a dark cur-\nrent that is able to pass through walls would be a clear\nsignal for the MCP hypothesis [47]. But even with a\nPVLAS-type experiment that measures only the rotation\nand ellipticity signals, one can collect strong evidence fa-\nvoring one and disfavoring other scenarios.\nPerforming one measurement of the absolute values of\nrotation and ellipticity, one can typically find values for\nthe masses and couplings in all scenarios, such that the\npredicted rotation and ellipticity is in agreement with the\nexperiment.\nOne clear distinction can already be made by measur-\ning the sign of the ellipticity and rotation signals. In the\nALP scenario, a measurement of the sign of either the\nrotation or the ellipticity is sufficient to decide between\na scalar or pseudoscalar. Measuring the sign of both sig-\nnals already is a consistency check; if the signal signs\nturn out to be inconsistent, the ALP scenarios for both\nthe scalar and the pseudoscalar would be ruled out. In\nthe MCP scenario, a measurement of the sign of rotation\ndecides between scalars and fermions. If only the sign\nof the ellipticity signal is measured, both options still re-\nmain, since the sign of the ellipticity changes when one\nmoves from large to small masses: the hierarchy of the\nrefractive indices is inverted in the region of anomalous\ndispersion. But at least the sign tells us if we are in the\nregion of large or small masses, corresponding to a small\nn\u2016 > n\u22a5 n\u2016 < n\u22a5\npi\u2016 > pi\u22a5\nALP 0\u2212 or\nMCP 1\n2\n(small \u03c7)\nMCP 1\n2\n(large \u03c7)\npi\u2016 < pi\u22a5 MCP 0 (large \u03c7)\nALP 0+ or\nMCP 0 (small \u03c7)\nTABLE I: Summary of the allowed particle-physics interpre-\ntation arising from a sign analysis of birefringence induced\nby different refractive indices n\u2016,\u22a5 and dichroism induced by\ndifferent probability exponents pi\u2016,\u22a5.\nor large \u03c7 parameter, cf. Eq. (19). This sign analysis is\nsummarized in Table I.\nMore information can be obtained by varying the pa-\nrameters of the experiment. In principle, we can vary all\nexperimental parameters appearing in Eqs. (11), (12),\n(17) and (22): the strength of the magnetic field B, the\nfrequency of the laser \u03c9, and the length of the magnetic\nfield inside the cavity L.\nLet us start with the magnetic field dependence. For\nthe ALP scenario both rotation and ellipticity signals are\nproportional to B2,\n\u2206\u03b8ALP \u223c B2, \u03c8ALP \u223c B2 (30)\nwhereas for MCP\u2019s we have\n\u2206\u03b8MCP \u223c\n{\nexp\n(\u2212 constB ) B small\nB\n2\n3 B large\n(31)\n\u03c8MCP \u223c\n{\nB2 B small\nB\n2\n3 B large.\nIn the left panels of Fig. 2 we demonstrate the different\nbehavior (for the ellipticity signal the B\n2\n3 -dependence is\nnot yet visible as it appears only at much stronger fields).\nThe model parameters for ALPs and MCPs are chosen\nsuch that the absolute value of \u2206\u03b8 and \u03c8 matches the\nPVLAS results (\u03bb = 1064 nm, B = 5 T, and L = 1 m)\nshown as the crossing of the dotted lines together with\ntheir statistical errors. In a similar manner, the signals\nalso depend on the wavelength of the laser light, which\nis shown in the center panels of Fig. 2.\nFinally, there is one more crucial difference between\nthe ALP and the MCP scenario. Production of a sin-\ngle particle can occur coherently. This leads to a faster\ngrowth of the signal\n\u2206\u03b8ALP \u223c L2, \u03c8ALP \u223c L2 L small. (32)\nIn the MCP scenario, however, the produced particles\nare essentially lost and we have only a linear dependence\non the length of the interaction region,\n\u2206\u03b8MCP \u223c L, \u03c8MCP \u223c L. (33)\nThis is shown in the right panels of Fig. 2.\nWe conclude that studying the dependence of the sig-\nnal on the parameters of the experiment can give crucial\ninformation to decide between the ALP and MCP sce-\nnarios, as we will also see in the following section.\nIV. CONFRONTATION WITH DATA\nIn this Section, we want to confront the prediction of\nthe ALP andMCP scenarios for vacuummagnetic dichro-\nism, birefringence, and photon regeneration with the cor-\nresponding data from the BFRT [2] and PVLAS [3, 4, 5]\ncollaborations, as well as from the Q&A experiment [30].\n7FIG. 2: Dependence of the rotation and ellipticity signals on the strength of the magnetic field B, the wavelength \u03bb of the laser,\nand the length L of the magnetic region inside the cavity. For ALPs (dark green) and MCPs (light red). The crossing of the\nblue dotted lines corresponds to the PVLAS published rotation and preliminary ellipticity signal for B = 5 T, \u03bb = 1064 nm,\nand L = 1 m.\nThe corresponding experimental findings are summarized\nin Tables II, III, and IV, respectively.\nIn the following we combine these results in a simple\nstatistical analysis. For simplicity, we assume that the\nlikelihood function Li of the rotation, the ellipticity and\nthe photon regeneration rate follows a Gaussian distribu-\ntion in each measurement i with mean value and standard\ndeviation as indicated in Tables II-IV. In the case of the\nBFRT upper limits, we approximate the likelihood func-\ntions by4 L \u221d exp((\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8hypo)2\/(2\u03c82noise)). Taking these\ninputs as statistically independent values we can estimate\nthe combined log-likelihood function as lnL \u2248 \u2211i lnLi\n[66]. With these assumptions the method of maximum\nlikelihood is equivalent to the method of least squares\nwith \u03c72 = const\u2212 2\u2211i lnLi. A more sophisticated sta-\ntistical analysis is beyond the scope of this work and re-\nquires detailed knowledge of the data analysis.\n4 We set the negative photon regeneration rate (Tab. II) at BFRT\nfor \u03b8 = 0 equal to zero.\nA. ALP hypothesis\nFigure 3 shows the results of a fit based on the pseu-\ndoscalar (left panels) or scalar (right panels) ALP hy-\npothesis. The BFRT upper limits5 are shown by blue-\nshaded regions. The Q&A upper rotation limit is de-\npicted as a gray-shaded region, but this limit exerts lit-\ntle influence on the global fit in the ALP scenario. The\nPVLAS results are displayed as green bands according\nto the 5\u03c3 confidence level (C.L.) with dark green corre-\nsponding to published data and light green corresponding\nto preliminary results.

We took an average value of 500 nm in our fitting\nprocedure.\n8FIG. 3: ALP: The 5\u03c3 confidence level of the model parameters (red). The blue shaded regions arise from the BFRT upper\nlimits for regeneration (darkblue), rotation (blue) and ellipticity (lightblue). The gray shaded region is the Q&A upper limit\nfor rotation. The bands show the PVLAS 5\u03c3 C.L.s for rotation (coarse-hatched) and ellipticity (fine-hatched) with \u03bb = 532 nm\n(left-hatched) and \u03bb = 1064 nm (right-hatched), respectively. The darkgreen band shows the published result for rotation with\n\u03bb = 1064 nm. The lightgreen bands result from an inclusion of preliminary data from PVLAS. The upper panels show the fit\nto the published data; the center panels include also the preliminary data from PVLAS, and the lower panels depict the fit\nusing only PVLAS data. The preliminary data is only used to demonstrate the potential to distinguish between the different\nscenarios.\nor pseudoscalar ALPs are very similar: in addition to\nthe allowed 5\u03c3 region at m\u03c6 \u2243 1 . . . 2\u00d7 10\u22123 eV also re-\nported by PVLAS [3], we observe further allowed islands\nfor larger mass values. The \u03c72\/d.o.f.

Table V.\nThis degeneracy between the scalar and the pseudo-\nscalar ALP scenario is lifted upon the inclusion of the\npreliminary PVLAS data (center panels), since the nega-\ntive sign of the birefringence signal with n\u2016 < n\u22a5 strongly\nprefers the scalar ALP scenario. In addition, the size of\nthe preliminary ellipticity result is such that the higher\nmass islands are ruled out, and the low mass island settles\naround m\u03c6 \u2243 10\u22123 eV and g \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 GeV\u22121. The\nresults from a fit to PVLAS data only (published and\npreliminary) as displayed in the lower panels of Fig. 3\nremain similar.\n9FIG. 4: MCP: The 5\u03c3 confidence level of the model parameters (red). The blue shaded regions arise from the BFRT upper\nlimits for rotation (blue) and ellipticity (lightblue). The gray shaded region is the Q&A upper limit for rotation. The bands\nshow the PVLAS 5\u03c3 C.L.s for rotation (coarse-hatched) and ellipticity (fine-hatched) with \u03bb = 532 nm (left-hatched) and\n\u03bb = 1064 nm (right-hatched), respectively. The darkgreen band shows the published result for rotation with \u03bb = 1064 nm. The\nlightgreen bands result from an inclusion of preliminary data from PVLAS. The upper panels show the fit to the published data;\nthe center panels include also the preliminary data from PVLAS, and the lower panels depict the fit using only PVLAS data.\nThe preliminary data is only used to demonstrate the potential to distinguish between the different scenarios. The preliminary\nPVLAS value for the sign of the ellipticity singles out the large-\u03c7 (small-mass) branch of the fermionic MCP 1\n2\nand the small-\u03c7\n(large-mass) branch of the scalar MCP 0, cf. Table I, as is visible in the center and lower panels.\nB. MCP hypothesis\nFigure 4 shows the results of a fit based on the\nfermionic (left panels) or scalar (right panels) MCP hy-\npothesis. The MCP hypothesis gives similar results for\nscalars and fermions if only the published data is included\nin the fit (upper panels). MCP masses m\u01eb larger than\n0.1 eV are ruled out by the upper limits of BFRT. But the\n5\u03c3 CL region shows a degeneracy towards smaller masses.\nIt is interesting to observe that the available Q&A data\nalready approaches the ballpark of the PVLAS rotation\nsignal in the light of the MCP hypothesis, whereas it is\nmuch less relevant for the ALP hypothesis.\nIncluding the PVLAS preliminary data, the fit for\nfermionic MCPs becomes different from the scalar MCP\ncase: because of the negative sign of the birefringence\nsignal, only the large-\u03c7\/small-m\u01eb branch remains accept-\nable for the fermionic MCP, whereas the small-\u03c7\/large-\n10\nBFRT experiment\nRotation (L = 8.8 m, \u03bb = 514.5 nm, \u03b8 = pi\/4)\nNpass |\u2206\u03b8| [nrad] \u2206\u03b8noise [nrad]\n254 0.35 0.30\n34 0.26 0.11\nEllipticity (L = 8.8 m, \u03bb = 514.5 nm, \u03b8 = pi\/4)\nNpass |\u03c8| [nrad] \u03c8noise [nrad]\n578 40.0 11.0\n34 1.60 0.44\nRegeneration (L = 4.4 m, \u3008\u03bb\u3009 = 500 nm, Npass = 200)\n\u03b8 [rad] rate [Hz]\n0 \u22120.012 \u00b1 0.009\npi\/2 0.013 \u00b1 0.007\nTABLE II: The vacuum rotation \u2206\u03b8, ellipticity \u03c8 and photon\nregeneration rate from the BFRT [2] experiment.

ALP vs. MCP\nLet us first stress that the partly preliminary status\nof the data used for our analysis does not yet allow for\na clear preference of either of the two scenarios, ALP\nor MCP. Based on the published data only, the ALP\nscenarios give a better fit, since the upper limits by BFRT\nand Q&A leave an unconstrained parameter space open\nto the PVLAS rotation data. By contrast, the BFRT\nand Q&A upper limits already begin to restrict the MCP\nparameter space of the PVLAS rotation signal in a sizable\nmanner, which explains the better \u03c72\/d.o.f. for the ALP\nscenario.\nBased on the (in part preliminary) PVLAS data alone,\nthe MCP scenario would be slightly preferred in compar-\nison with the ALP scenario, see Table V, bottom row.\nThe reason is that the PVLAS measurements of bire-\nfringence and rotation for the different laser wavelengths\nshow a better internal compatibility in the scalar MCP\ncase than in the scalar ALP scenario.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe signal observed by PVLAS \u2013 a rotation of linearly\npolarized laser light induced by a transverse magnetic\nfield \u2013 has generated a great deal of interest over the\nrecent months. Since the signal has found no explana-\ntion within standard QED or from other standard-model\n11\nsectors, it could be the first direct evidence of physics\nbeyond the standard model.\nThe proposed attempts to explain this result fall into\ntwo categories:\n1. conversion of laser photons into a single neutral spin-0\nparticle (scalar or pseudoscalar) coupled to two photons\n(called axion-like particle or ALP) and\n2. pair production of fermions or bosons with a small\nelectric charge (millicharged particles or MCPs).\nThe corresponding actions associated with these two pro-\nposals should be viewed as pure low-energy effective field\ntheories which are valid at laboratory scales at which the\nexperiments operate. A naive extrapolation of these the-\nories to higher scales generically becomes incompatible\nwith astrophysical bounds. In this paper, we have com-\npared the different low-energy effective theories in light\nof the presently available data from optical experiments.\nWe have summarized the formulas for rotation and el-\nlipticity in the different scenarios and contributed new\nresults for millicharged scalars. We have then studied\nhow optical experiments can provide for decisive infor-\nmation to discriminate between the different scenarios:\nthis information can be obtained in the form of size and\nsign of rotation and ellipticity and their dependence on\nexperimental parameters like the strength of the mag-\nnetic field, the wavelength of the laser and the length of\nthe magnetic region.\nOur main results are depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 which\nshow the allowed parameter regions for the different sce-\nnarios. On the basis of the published data, none of\nthe scenarios can currently be excluded. The remain-\ning open parameter regions should be regarded as good\ncandidates for the target regions of future experiments.\nAs the preliminary PVLAS data illustrates, near future\noptical measurements can further constrain the parame-\nter space and even decide between the different scenar-\nios. For instance, a negative ellipticity n\u2016 < n\u22a5 together\nwith a rotation corresponding to probability exponents\n\u03c0\u2016 > \u03c0\u22a5 would rule out the scalar or pseudo-scalar ALP\ninterpretation altogether.\nBe it from optical experiments like PVLAS or from\nthe proposed \u201clight\/dark current shining through a wall\u201d\nexperiments, we will soon know more about the particle\ninterpretation of PVLAS.\nVI.

Since the formulas in this appendix are\nequally valid for the MCP scenario as well as standard\nQED, we denote the coupling and mass of the fluctuating\nparticle with \u03b1\u02dc, or e\u02dc, and m\u02dc with the dictionary:\nMCP: e\u02dc = \u01ebe, \u03b1\u02dc = \u01eb2\u03b1, m\u02dc = m\u01eb,\nQED: e\u02dc = e, \u03b1\u02dc = \u03b1, m\u02dc = me. (A1)\nThe effective action in one-loop approximation can be\nwritten as\n\u0393[A] = Scl[A] + \u0393\n1[A] = \u2212\n\u222b\nx\nF + \u03931[A], (A2)\nwhere we have introduced the field-strength invariant F\ncorresponding to the Maxwell action. The two possible\ninvariants are\nF = 1\n4\nF\u00b5\u03bdF\n\u00b5\u03bd =\n1\n2\n( ~B2\u2212 ~E2), G = 1\n4\nF\u00b5\u03bd F\u02dc\n\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212 ~E \u00b7 ~B.\n(A3)\nwith F\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd =\n1\n2\u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03ba\u03bbF\n\u03ba\u03bb. Also useful are the two secular\ninvariants a, b, corresponding to the eigenvalues of the\nfield strength tensor,\na =\n\u221a\u221a\nF2 + G2 + F , b =\n\u221a\u221a\nF2 + G2 \u2212F , (A4)\nwith the inverse relations\n|G| = ab, F = 1\n2\n(a2 \u2212 b2). (A5)\nLet us start with the fermion-induced effective action,\ni.e., the classic Heisenberg-Euler effective action. The\none-loop contribution reads\n\u03931Dsp =\n1\n8\u03c02\n\u222b\nx\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\ns3\ne\u2212im\u02dc\n2s\n\u00d7\n(\ne\u02dcas cot(e\u02dcas) e\u02dcbs coth(e\u02dcbs) +\n2\n3\n(e\u02dcs)2F \u2212 1\n)\n. (A6)\nExpanding this action to quartic order in the field\nstrength results in\n\u03931Dsp =\n\u222b\nx\n(\ncDsp\u22a5 F2 + cDsp\u2016 G2\n)\n, (A7)\nwhere the constant prefactors read\ncDsp\u22a5 =\n8\n45\n\u03b1\u02dc2\nm\u02dc4\n, cDsp\u2016 =\n14\n45\n\u03b1\u02dc2\nm\u02dc4\n. (A8)\nIt is straightforward to derive the modified Maxwell\nequations from Eq. (A7). From these, the dispersion rela-\ntions for the two polarization eigenmodes of a plane-wave\n12\nfield in an external magnetic field can be determined [62],\nyielding the phase velocities in the low-frequency limit,\nv\u22a5 = 1\u2212 cDsp\u22a5 B2 sin2 \u03b8B , v\u2016 = 1\u2212 cDsp\u2016 B2 sin2 \u03b8B.\n(A9)\nObviously, the \u22a5 mode is slightly faster than the \u2016 mode,\nsince the coefficient cDsp\u22a5 < c\nDsp\n\u2016 .\nNext we turn to the effective action which is induced\nby charged scalar fluctuations, i.e., the Heisenberg-Euler\neffective action for scalar QED. The one-loop contribu-\ntion now reads\n\u03931sc = \u2212\n1\n16\u03c02\n\u222b\nx\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nds\ns3\ne\u2212im\u02dc\n2s\n\u00d7\n(\ne\u02dcas\nsin(e\u02dcas)\ne\u02dcbs\nsinh(e\u02dcbs)\n\u2212 1\n3\n(e\u02dcs)2F \u2212 1\n)\n. (A10)\nThere are three differences to the fermion-induced action:\nthe minus sign arises from Grassmann integration in the\nfermionic case. The factor of 1\/2 comes from the differ-\nence between a trace over a complex scalar and that over\na Dirac spinor. The replacement of cot and coth by in-\nverse sin and sinh is due to the Pauli spin-field coupling\nin the fermionic case.\nExpanding the scalar-induced action to quartic order\nin the field strength results in\n\u03931sc =\n\u222b\nx\n(\ncsc\u22a5 F2 + csc\u2016 G2\n)\n, (A11)\nwhere the constant prefactors this time read\ncsc\u22a5 =\n7\n90\n\u03b1\u02dc2\nm\u02dc4\n, csc\u2016 =\n1\n90\n\u03b1\u02dc2\nm\u02dc4\n. (A12)\nThe velocities of the two polarization modes then results\nin\nv\u22a5 = 1\u2212 csc\u22a5B2 sin2 \u03b8B, v\u2016 = 1\u2212 csc\u2016 B2 sin2 \u03b8B. (A13)\nThis time, the \u22a5 mode is significantly slower than the \u2016\nmode, since the order of the coefficients is now reversed\ncsc\u22a5 > c\nsc\n\u2016 .\nIn a birefringence experiment, the induced ellipticity\nin the two cases is different in magnitude as well as in\nsign. Already at this stage, we can expect that the same\ndifference will also be visible in the dichroism. At higher\nfrequencies, the slower mode necessarily has to exhibit a\nstronger anomalous dispersion. By virtue of dispersion\nrelations, we can expect that this goes along with a larger\nattenuation coefficient. As a result, the direction of the\ninduced rotation will be opposite for the two cases, as is\nconfirmed by the explicit result in Sect. II B 2.\nAPPENDIX B: POLARIZATION TENSORS\nThe polarization tensor in an external constant mag-\nnetic field can be decomposed into\n\u03a0\u00b5\u03bd(k|B) = \u03a00 P\u00b5\u03bd0 +\u03a0\u2016 P\u00b5\u03bd\u2016 +\u03a0\u22a5 P\u00b5\u03bd\u22a5 , (B1)\nwhere the Pi denote orthogonal projectors, and only the\n\u2016,\u22a5 components are relevant for the dichroism and bire-\nfringence experiments; the corresponding projectors P\u2016,\u22a5\nrefer to the polarization eigenmodes discussed in the\nmain text [62, 67]. Dropping terms of higher order in\nthe light cone deformation k2 \u2243 0 as a self-consistent\napproximation, the coefficient functions can be written\nas\n\u03a0\u2016,\u22a5 = \u2212\u03c92 sin2 \u03b8B\n\u03b1\n4\u03c0\n(\n\u22122\n1\n) \u221e\u222b\n0\nds\ns\n1\u222b\n\u22121\nd\u03bd\n2\ne\u2212is\u03c60 N\u2016,\u22a5,\n(B2)\nwhere the upper component holds for the spinor case and\nthe lower for the scalar case. The phase reads in both\ncases\n\u03c60 = m\u02dc\n2 \u2212 \u03c92 sin2 \u03b8B\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bd2\n4\n\u2212 1\n2\ncos \u03bde\u02dcBs\u2212 cos e\u02dcBs\ne\u02dcBs sin e\u02dcBs\n)\n\u2243 m\u02dc2 + \u03c9 sin2 \u03b8B (1 \u2212 \u03bd\n2)2\n48\n(e\u02dcBs)2. (B3)\nFor completeness, let us list the integrand functions of\nthe spinor case first,\nNDsp\u2016 =\ne\u02dcBs cos \u03bde\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n\u2212 e\u02dcBs cot e\u02dcBs\n(\n1\u2212 \u03bd2 + \u03bd sin \u03bde\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n)\n,\nNDsp\u22a5 = \u2212\ne\u02dcBs cos \u03bde\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n+\n\u03bde\u02dcBs sin \u03bde\u02dcBs cot e\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n+\n2e\u02dcBs(cos \u03bde\u02dcBs\u2212 cos e\u02dcBs)\nsin3 e\u02dcBs\n. (B4)\nThe corresponding lowest-order expansions in e\u02dcBs which\nare relevant for the desired approximation are\nNDsp\u2016 =\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03bd2)\n(\n1\u2212 1\n3\n\u03bd2\n)\n(e\u02dcBs)2,\nNDsp\u22a5 =\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03bd2)\n(\n1\n2\n+\n1\n6\n\u03bd2\n)\n(e\u02dcBs)2. (B5)\nInserting these expansions into Eq. (B2), the parameter\nintegrations can be performed, resulting in the expres-\nsions listed in Sect. II B 1. Note that the expansion co-\nefficients in Eq. (B5) also pop up in the final result for\nthe absorption coefficients and the refractive indices, see\nbelow.\nThe corresponding integrand functions for the scalar\n13\ncase read6 [65]\nN sc\u2016 =\u2212\ne\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n(\n\u2212\u03bd2 + \u03bd sin \u03bde\u02dcBs\nsin e\u02dcBs\n)\n, (B6)\nN sc\u22a5 =+\n\u03bde\u02dcBs sin \u03bde\u02dcBs\nsin2 e\u02dcBs\n\u2212 e\u02dcBs\nsin3 e\u02dcBs\n(\n1 + cos2 eBs\u2212 2 cos e\u02dcBs cos \u03bde\u02dcBs) .\nThe corresponding expansions are\nN sc\u2016 = \u2212\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03bd2)\n(\n1\n3\n\u03bd2\n)\n(e\u02dcBs)2, (B7)\nN sc\u22a5 = \u2212\n1\n2\n(1\u2212 \u03bd2)\n(\n1\n2\n\u2212 1\n6\n\u03bd2\n)\n(e\u02dcBs)2.\nThe overall minus sign difference between Eqs. (B5) and\n(B7) will be used to cancel the minus sign difference be-\ntween the scalar and the spinor case in Eq. (B2). Apart\nfrom the overall factor of 2, the desired formulas for the\nscalar case can be directly constructed from the spinor\ncase by simple replacements as suggested by a compari-\nson between Eqs. (B5) and (B7).\nWith the findings of this section, we can directly ob-\ntain the results for the photon absorption coefficients and\nrefractive indices as given in the main text.\nAPPENDIX C: ROTATION AND ELLIPTICITY AT BFRT\nThe BFRT experiment uses a magnetic field with time-varying amplitude B = B0 + \u2206B cos(\u03c9mt + \u03c6m). The\nmeasured rotation and ellipticity correspond to the Fourier coefficient of the light intensity at frequency \u03c9m. To a\ngood accuracy, the Fourier coefficient can be read off from the first-order Taylor expansion of the optical functions\nwith respect to \u2206B. The rotation effect for fermionic MCPs linear to cos(\u03c9mt+\u03c6m) is given by Eqs. (2) and (17) for\nB = B0 and \u03c70 = \u03c7(B0) with\nTDsp\u2016,\u22a5 =\n4\n\u221a\n3\n\u03c0\u03c70\n1\u222b\n0\ndv\n\u2206B\nB0\n[(\n4\n\u03c70\n1\n1\u2212 v2\n)\nK5\/3\n(\n4\n\u03c70\n1\n1\u2212 v2\n)\n\u2212 2\n3\nK2\/3\n(\n4\n\u03c70\n1\n1\u2212 v2\n)]\n\u00d7\n[(\n1\u2212 13v2\n)\n\u2016\n,\n(\n1\n2 +\n1\n6v\n2\n)\n\u22a5\n]\n(1\u2212 v2) .
