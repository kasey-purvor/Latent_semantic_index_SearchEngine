This is \nthe first adequately powered randomized controlled trial we are aware of \ninvestigating metal backed, patella resurfacing, and mobile bearing prostheses.  We \nfound no evidence of effect of these variants on early complications or functional \nrecovery up to two years after total knee replacement.   \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \nTotal knee arthroplasty is now a common and established surgical procedure.  Long-\nterm observational studies indicate that more than 90% of modern primary knee \nreplacements survive from 13 to 15 years1.  Continued developments in design are \naimed at further improving quality of life and lengthening prosthetic survival.   \n \nOne common variation is the design of the tibial component. There are theoretical \nadvantages of a metal backing plate in that it distributes load more evenly across the \ninterface and reduces stresses, which may contribute to loosening and to failure of \nthe polyethylene articular surface.  However, metal backing reduces the thickness of \nthe polyethylene that can be implanted in the available space, thus increasing the \ninternal stress distribution in the plastic which in turn risks internal loading \nexceeding the capacity of the plastic.  This may cause sub-surface shearing effects \nand hence breakdown of the bearing surface.  Also, metal backing is more expensive \nand good long-term results have been reported for non-metal backed components2.  \nLimited comparisons between metal backed and non metal backed components have \nbeen performed and to our knowledge no definitive difference has been \ndeterminable3. \n \nAnother variation is that the patella may or may not be resurfaced.  Previous small \nscale randomized controlled trials, non-randomized cohort studies and a systematic \nreview have not resolved this uncertainty4, 5, 6.    \n \nMore recent designs of knee replacement have focussed on whether performance and \nlongevity can be improved by altering the design of the bearing between the tibia \nand femur, to address complications of wear and loosening.  Some authors7, 8 claim \n 4 \nthat polyethylene wear and shearing effects at the prosthesis bone interface could be \nreduced if there was a moving component between the tibia and the femur.  At the \nmoment, only the mobile bearing New Jersey Knee (DePuy Orthopaedics) has any \nlong term follow up9.  A relatively recent Cochrane review has shed little light on the \npotential advantages of the more complex rotating platform designs10.  Dislocation of \nthe mobile component has been a not infrequently reported problem9, 11   ; in \nparticular, so-called to spin out of the mobile component12, 13.  \n \nThe Knee Arthroplasty Trial (KAT) is a pragmatic multicenter, randomized, \ncontrolled trial designed to determine:  whether a metal backed plate for the tibial \ncomponent is more effective and cost-effective than a single high density \npolyethylene component; whether or not it is more effective and cost-effective to \nresurface the patella; and whether a mobile bearing between the tibia and femur has \na better outcome than standard designs without a moving bearing.  In this report we \ndescribe complications and patient-assessed functional and quality of life outcomes \nup to two years.   \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nSurgeons \nThe trial was approved by relevant national and local research ethics committees.  \nOrthopaedic surgeons were eligible to take part provided they performed knee \nreplacements routinely.  Surgeons elected which comparisons to contribute to, ahead \nof trial participation.  We recognized that surgeons would vary in the comparisons \nfor which they would accept random allocation.  One hundred and sixteen surgeons \nin 34 United Kingdom (UK) centers participated.   \n \n 5 \nPatients \nAll patients under the care of a collaborating surgeon were potentially eligible for \ninclusion if a decision had been made to have primary total knee replacement \nsurgery.  A patient was not eligible for a trial comparison if the surgeon considered \nthat a particular type of operation was clearly indicated for example, a patient \nrequiring a highly constrained knee replacement to replace function of the collateral \nligaments. A patient remained eligible only if the surgeon remained comfortable that \nthere was no indication for one choice either way within the trial; for example, the \nsurgeon would not have chosen to replace a thin or osteopenic patella.  \n     \nWhere possible, patients schedulled for a total knee replacement were sent \ninformation about relevant aspects of the study in advance of their hospital \nadmission.  While it was anticipated that most participants would be enrolled into a \nsingle comparison, individuals could be recruited to more than one comparison, if \nclinically appropriate.  The minority of participants that were included in more than \none comparison were randomized within each relevant comparison using a partial \nfactorial design ensuring balance of allocation within and across comparisons. \n \nSurgical procedures \nWithin the randomized comparisons, all prostheses had suitable alternative designs.   \nSurgeons followed their standard practice.   The technique utilized did not therefore \nrequire any modification for the purposes of the trial and so outcomes were not \ninfluenced by a so-called \u2018learning curve\u2019 effect.  We did not influence whether \nsurgeons utilized cruciate retaining or substituting implants.    All other aspects of \ncare, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, were left to the discretion of \nthe responsible surgeon. \n 6 \n \nPrincipal outcome measures \nThe principal outcome measures were: functional status (Oxford Knee Score, OKS), \nquality of life (Short Form (SF)12 and EuroQual (EQ)5D) and intra- and \npostoperative complications including the need for further surgery.  Secondary \noutcomes, including costs and cost-effectiveness, are also being assessed but are not \nreported here.   The questionnaire included: the Oxford Knee Score14; the SF-1215; the \nEQ-5D16; 17; and questions about any further hospital admissions and surgery.  The \nOxford Knee Score was selected as a primary outcome measure because it had been \ndeveloped specifically to measure outcomes of knee replacement surgery and had \nbeen shown by a range of independent studies to perform very well compared to \nalternative possible instruments18, 19, 20.   \n \n \nSample size estimation \nThe size of effect on the OKS sought for each comparison (and hence the sample size \nchosen) was based on: the size of differences in OKS that seemed likely judged on \ncurrent experience, and the size of effect that was likely to offset any adverse effects \nand cost differences.  For the tibial metal backed and mobile bearing comparisons, \nthis was 3 points: 350 participants provided 80% statistical power and 470 \nparticipants 90% power to identify this difference (P<0.05).  For the patellar \nresurfacing comparison, the difference sought was 1.5 points: 1400 participants \nprovided 80% power (P<0.05).   \n \n 7 \nRandomization \nIf the surgeon thought a patient was eligible to participate in a comparison for which \nthe surgeon had registered, fuller details of the trial were provided and signed \ninformed consent to participate was sought.  For patients who joined the trial, the \nrelevant aspect(s) of the replacement were chosen prior to surgery by random \nallocation.   An automated centralized telephone randomization service was called. \nAfter basic identifying and had been given over the phone, an allocation to the \nrelevant comparison as described above or combination of comparisons was given, \nstratifying by surgeon, with minimization (randomization balanced with respect to \nspecified variables) according to the patient\u2019s age (<59, 60-79>, 80+), gender (male, \nfemale), and site of disease (single knee, both, general arthritis).   \n \nData collection \nData were collected prospectively on standard forms to record preoperative, \noperative, and postoperative information.  Data describing functional status and \nquality of life were collected directly from participants through postal \nquestionnaires.  Follow-up questionnaires were completed at approximately three-\nmonths, 1-year, and two-years after the operation; one reminder was sent if \nnecessary, followed by a phone call reminder if still unreturned, with the option then  \noffered to complete the questionnaire over the telephone.  The questionnaire \nincluded: the Oxford Knee Score14; the SF-1215; the EQ-5D16; 17; and questions about \nany further hospital admissions and surgery.  The Oxford Knee Score was selected as \na primary outcome measure because it had been developed specifically to measure \noutcomes of knee replacement surgery and had been shown by a range of \nindependent studies to perform very well compared to alternative possible \ninstruments18, 19, 20.   \n 8 \n \nStatistical analysis  \nThe three trial comparisons were analysed as separate trials.  Data were analysed on \nthe basis of the procedure allocation irrespective of what method of replacement was \nactually used (intention to treat principle).  The functional status and quality of life \noutcomes within each trial comparison were compared using analysis of covariance \nthat adjusted for baseline scores and the minimisation factors.  Readmission rates \nwithin each trial were analysed using logistic regression.  Operation times were \ncompared between the trials using the Mann-Whitney test and binary outcomes \n(grade of surgeon) were compared between trials using the chi-squared test. \nDescriptive statistics are presented where appropriate and effect sizes are presented \nwith associated 95% confidence intervals estimated with robust standard errors to \naccount for potential surgeon effects.  \n \n 9 \nRESULTS \nParticipant flow and recruitment \nFrom July 1999 to January 2003, 4070 potentially eligible patients were identified and \n2374 (58%) gave their consent and were randomized.  The main reasons for non-\nrandomization were: refusal to take part (546; 32%); surgeon did not want to \nrandomize (462; 27%); scheduled patients where we missed the opportunity to \nrecruit them (351; 21%); surgery cancelled or deferred or non attendance (146; 9%); \npatient not eligible (84; 5%); surgeon undertaking the procedure not registered to \nparticipate in the trial (38; 2%); necessary equipment not available (24; 1%); and \nreasons unknown (45; 3%).  Twenty-two patients were subsequently found to have \nbeen randomized in error: 14 were randomized twice; five were not eligible; and \nthree, were surgeons not registered to participate in the comparison.  This left 2352 \npatients formally in the trial: 409 in the comparison metal backing, 1715 in patellar \nresurfacing, and 539 in mobile bearing.  Background information for the CONSORT \nstatement can be found in Figure 1. \n \nBaseline data \nTable 1 provides a description of the groups at trial entry.  The overall mean age was \n70 years (SD 8 years, range 22 to 93), 43.7% (1014 of 318) were men, and the mean \nBody Mass Index was 29.7.  Within randomized comparisons, demographic and \nclinical data were well balanced at baseline although there were small differences \nacross the three comparisons; participants recruited to patella resurfacing tended to \nbe healthier as judged by the ASA (p = 0.004)21.  \n \n 10 \nManagement and operation details (Table 2) \nThe majority (83.1%; 1927 of 2318) of subjects underwent the procedure as planned.  \nOnly a small number of intraoperative complications were observed (2.7%; 59 of 2201 \nparticipants overall) and few problems were caused by the operative procedure \n(1.2%; 27 of 2201).  Overall, there were no differences between randomized groups in \nthese respects.  Median operation times were significantly lower in the metal versus \nnon-metal comparison compared to the other two comparisons (p<0.001), but there \nwas no evidence of a difference within the group comparisons.  There was evidence \nthat the operating surgeon was more likely to be a fully trained specialist \northopaedic surgeon (holds certificate of completion of specialist surgical training in \northopaedics or equivalent in the UK,) in the metal versus non-metal comparison \ncompared to the other two comparisons (p<0.001).   Whether the surgeon was fully \ntrained or still in supervised training did not differ within each trial comparison.  \nLateral patella retinacular release was performed most commonly in the patella \nresurfacing group (17.1%) (136) and least commonly in the non-metal backed group \n(10.2%) (20) (Table 3).   \n \nIn hospital care and short term complications (Table 3) \nPostoperative complications were reported in 14.9% (328 of 2207) of patients; \nhowever, specific problems such as  wound infection, septicemia, deep vein \nthrombosis or pulmonary embolism, cerebral vascular accident, and myocardial \ninfarction were all rare.  Overall, 1.8% (40 of 2206) of participants had further knee \nsurgery.  Four had knee dislocations.  One participant allocated to both patella \nresurfacing and fixed bearing, but who actually received a mobile bearing prosthesis, \nsubsequently required closed reduction of the joint for dislocation of the rotating \ninsert four days after the initial operation.  The participant had a further dislocation \n 11 \ntwo weeks later and was re-admitted for revision of the spacer and femoral \ncomponent.  One participant allocated to patella resurfacing had a subluxation of the \nbearing and required reoperation for replacement of the platform insert and the \nremaining two participants who had dislocations required manipulation under \nanaesthetic (one allocated to both no patella resurfacing and mobile bearing and the \nother allocated to no patella resurfacing).  Six participants died in the immediate \npostoperative period: two from a pulmonary embolism; one from a myocardial \ninfarction; one from ischaemic heart disease; one from pneumonia; and one from a \ncerebrovascular accident.  Overall, 95.2% (2101 of 2207) participants were discharged \nhome directly.  The length of hospital stay was a median of 9 days.  There were no \ndifferences between the randomized groups in  any of the above described areas.  \n \nPatient assessed outcome (Table 4) \nFunctional status and quality of life scores were low at baseline but improved \nmarkedly across all trial groups following knee replacement (mean overall OKS \nscore: 18.0 at baseline, 30.5 at 3 months, 34.2 at 1 year, 34.82 at 2-years).  Thus, most \nof the change was observed by three months after surgery (although further small \nimprovements were observed at 1-year and 2-years) (Figures 2, 3  and 4).  Within the \nindividual trial comparisons, there was no evidence of differences in functional \nstatus or quality of life measures between randomized groups at 2-years (Table 4).  \n \nComplications after surgery (Table 5) \nOverall, 9.9% (230 of 2318) were re-admitted for reasons related to the surgery on the \nknee and 5.8% (135 of 2318) went on to have further knee surgery.  Three participants \nhad above the knee amputations: two within two months of the initial operation and  \none three-months after surgery.  In one participant (allocated to non-metal backed) \n 12 \nthe knee became infected after an open repair of the quadriceps  tendons following a \nfall, another was due to vascular insufficiency one month after the initial operation \n(allocated to no patella resurfacing), and a third was due to diabetic ischemia \n(allocated to metal backed).  Fifteen participants have undergone staged revisions \ndue to infection.  Fifteen participants have had single stage revisions. Seven \nparticipants allocated to have no patella resurfacing have subsequently had their \npatellae resurfaced.  The principal reasons for readmission related to surgery were \nsuspected deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and infection such as \npneumonia or urinary tract infection.  Within each trial comparison, there were no \nstatistically significant differences in the number of patients requiring a readmission: \nfor metal versus non metal backed odds ratio 1.50 (95% CI 0.84 to 2.70), for patella \nresurfacing versus no patella resurfacing odds ratio 1.08 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.35) and for \nmobile versus fixed bearing odds ratio 0.83 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.33). \n 13 \nDISCUSSION \nThis multicenter United Kingdom (UK) -based trial has shown that as a group, \npatients undergoing primary TKR had substantial improvements in pain and \nfunction, whether assessed by condition-specific measures designed to evaluate TKR \nor by more generic measures of health-related quality of life.  Benefits were observed \nby three-months after surgery, but there were further small improvements in pain, \nphysical function and health-related quality of life subsequently up to two-years \nafter surgery.  No statistically significant differences in outcome were observed \nwithin any of the three randomized comparisons.  This is as might be expected for \nthe metal backing and rotating platform studies at this stage as alterations in these \ndesigns are with a view to longer-term benefit.  In contrast, patella resurfacing might \nbe expected to reduce pain and improve early function, but this was not observed.  \nThe lack of difference in improvement in scores irrespective of whether the patella \nwas replaced or not is consistent with the findings of Pakos et al. 6  The rate of knee \nrelated readmissions in their study was perhaps higher than might have been \nexpected although this was most commonly for manipulation under anaesthesia.   \n \nThe trial was pragmatic in design, which is unusual in orthopaedic surgery but \nwidely used to evaluate other health care.  Pragmatic trials aim to evaluate \ninterventions in a usual care context in terms of outcomes that are most important to \npatients.  Entry criteria are relatively flexible so that a range of patients is recruited \nenhancing generalisability.  The trial involved a large number of UK orthopaedic \nsurgeons, and hence reflects a wide range of practice in the UK, geographically and \nin terms of types of center and details of technique and strategy.  Surgeons elected \nwhich of the comparisons to recruit to.  For each comparison, randomization was \nstratified by surgeon to ensure balance between the trial groups in this respect.  \n 14 \nOutcomes focused on matters of concern to patients, using validated measures, \nindependent of surgeon opinion.  Each comparison included several hundred \nparticipants, such that the estimates of differences were relatively precise.  With \nrespect to the OKS, the upper confidence interval for any of the one-year \ncomparisons was 2.95 points,   The upper bound of the confidence interval around \nthe estimate effect of the interventions excludes the pre specified effect that was \ndeemed clinically important in all comparisons, so we can conclude that at one year \nthere is no evidence of superiority of metal-backed over non-, nor mobile bearing \nover fixed as defined by three points on the OKS, and in the resurfacing comparison \nno evidence of superiority of resurfacing over not resurfacing as defined by 1.5 \npoints on the OKS.   These are short term results though, and this does not rule out \nsuperiority over longer term.   \n \nIt should also be recognized that not every participant received the prosthesis \nallocated, and the prosthetic types in each of the groups may have subtle design \nvariations; secondary sub-group analyses are planned to explore this possibility. \n \nThe KAT study has demonstrated that large, simple-in-design trials across a range of \npractices in orthopaedics are feasible.  However, the study also demonstrated the \nneed for individual surgeons to be clinically uncertain about the appropriate \ntreatment choice. \nThe short-term results in the three trials are broadly consistent with evidence from \nother trials.   At this stage it is not possible to suggest to healthcare providers that \none particular design or variation in design has clinical advantages that warrant \nlimiting surgeon choice.  It is generally accepted that variations in outcomes of \ndifferent knee prostheses tend to emerge with longer-term follow-up and hence \n 15 \nrecommendations based on generic aspects of design may well be possible in the \nfuture.  \n \nAnnual follow-up is in place and will continue for at least ten years.  While the main \ncomparisons at follow-up will be between the generic variants of total knee \nreplacement, possible effects of subtle difference in design between manufacturers \nand between surgeons will be investigated.  Data from the KAT study will also be \nused to estimate the costs of each intervention and hence relative cost-effectiveness \nwithin each randomized comparison.   \n 16 \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
