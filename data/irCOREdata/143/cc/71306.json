This paper argues that cars \nare combined with their drivers into an assemblage, the 'driver-car', \nthat has become a form of social being that brings about distinctive \nsocial actions in modern society - driving, transporting, parking, \nconsuming, polluting, killing, communicating and so on. To understand \nthe nature of this assemblage a number of theoretical perspectives \nthat describe the interaction and collaboration between human beings \nand complex objects are explored; the process of driving, 'affordance', \nactor-network theory, and the embodied relationship between driver \nand car. This theoretical account of the driver-car is intended as a \npreliminary to the empirical investigation of the place of the driver-car \nin modern societies. \n  - 3 - \nIntroduction \nThe motor car has become ubiquitous in late modern societies, including the United \nKingdom where 70% of the population hold driving licences and there are nearly 23 \nmillion licensed cars. Whereas in 1960 the majority of households (71%) did not have \nthe regular use of a car, by 1999 the majority (72%) did (DETR 2000). As long ago as \n1963, Roland Barthes (1993: 1136) pointed out that the car had become a \u2018need\u2019 not \na luxury and in 1968 Henri Lefebvre (1971: 100) called it the 'Leading-Object' in \nterms of its centrality within the culture of modern societies. The car shapes the built \nenvironment, cuts through the landscape, dominates the soundscape, is a key \ncommodity in production and consumption. Despite this prominence the car, unlike \nfor example the impact of information technology, has largely been ignored by \nsociology as a component of social being and social action in late modernity \n(Hawkins 1986; Dant and Martin 2001; Miller 2001a).  \nThe car has been considered from two key perspectives in the social sciences, firstly \nas a commodity that exemplifies the development of production in industrial \ncapitalism1 and secondly as a commodity that exemplifies the desired object which \nmotivates consumers in late capitalism.2 Recently the issue of mobility has begun to \ndirect attention to the car (Urry 2000) and a number of features of car culture have \nbegun to be explored (e.g. Miller 2001b). What is surprising, however, is that the car \nhas not attracted much more than cursory commentary as an object that actually \nshapes the form and content of social action (although see Elias 1995). More often \nthan not, the car and motor traffic is used as a taken-for-granted analogy to explain \nother social actions such as those of pedestrian traffic (e.g. Goffman 1971). But the \nway that the car has introduced new forms of social action in late modernity, thereby \ncontributing to its distinctive nature, has not yet been the focus of serious sociological \nattention. This paper explores the \u2018assemblage\u20193 of the driver-car as a form of social \nbeing that produces a range of social actions that are associated with the car; driving, \n  - 4 - \ntransporting, parking, consuming, polluting, killing, communicating and so on. The \nform of social being that results from the collaboration of human and machine has \nattracted the term \u2018cyborg\u2019 (Haraway 1991; Bukatman 1993; Featherstone and \nBurrows 1995) but as I have argued before (Dant 1999: 191-194) the term \u2018cyborg\u2019 \nproperly refers to the feedback systems incorporated into the body that can be used \nto replace or enhance human body parts. Tim Luke develops Haraway's (1996) \n'ironic political myth' of the cyborg to comment on the cultural and economic \n'dehumanization' of the car driver's subjectivity as she or he becomes merged with a \ncar to create a new cyborg life form, the 'car-and-driver' (1996: 17-19) but the idea of \nthe cyborg tends to fix and reify the assemblage. While the car can be seen as a \nmobility aid for the able-bodied, human subjectivity is in no sense constituted by \ngetting into a car; it is a temporary assemblage within which the human remains \ncomplete in his or herself. For the same reason it is unhelpful to think of the driver-\ncar assemblage as a \u2018hybrid\u2019, a term used by actor-network theory (Callon 1991:139) \nand by others (Rosen 1995, 2002; Dant 1998; Urry 1999) to refer to the collaboration \nof human and object forms. The word hybrid refers to the offspring of two species \nthat are usually unable to reproduce whereas the driver-car is an assemblage that \ncomes apart when the driver leaves the vehicle and which can be endlessly \nreformed, or re-assembled given the availability of the component cars and drivers. \nThe term \u2018hybrid\u2019 is used more strictly (e.g. by Latour 1996:150) to refer to entities \nthat result from permanently combining similar types of object \u2013 car commentators of \ncourse use the term in this way to refer to models that combine two types such as the \nsports\/utility vehicle.  \nThe driver-car is not a species resulting from chance mating but a product of human \ndesign, manufacture and choice. The particular driver-car may be assembled from \ndifferent components with consequent variations in ways of acting and its modal form \nmay vary over time and place. However, despite variations, the assemblage of the \n  - 5 - \ndriver-car enables a form of social action that has become routine and habitual, \naffecting many aspects of late modern society. The aim of this paper is to begin to \ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the way in which the assemblage is formed. \nNeither the human driver or the car acting apart could bring about the types of action \nthat the assemblage can; it is the particular ways in which their capacities are \nbrought together that bring about the impact of the automobile on modern societies.  \nIn this article I will explore a number of ways in which the assemblage of the driver-\ncar can be understood to begin to build an account of the relationship between its \ncomponents. Here the argument is theoretical and tentative but it is intended that it \nwill provide the basis for empirical sociological investigation of the driver-car and \nbegin to develop ways of understanding other human \/ object assemblages. What is \nat stake is whether social life is simply the result of relationships between human \nbeings forming into social groups or whether collaborations between human beings \nand material objects contribute to the formation of societies and give them particular \ncharacteristics and features.   \nThe driver-car's affordances \nIn an article originally published in 1938 the ecological psychologist James J. Gibson \nattempted to understand the process of driving a car. He developed a concept of the \n\u2018field of safe travel\u2019: \nIt consists, at any given moment, of the field of possible paths which \nthe car may take unimpeded. Phenomenally it is a sort of tongue \nprotruding forward along the road. Its boundaries are chiefly \ndetermined by objects or features of the terrain with a negative \n\u2018valence\u2019 in perception - in other words obstacles. \n(Gibson 1982a:120 - emphasis in original) \n  - 6 - \nGibson was concerned with how the driver's perception of the road enabled her or \nhim to undertake the action of driving. The 'field of safe travel' is a psychologist's \nconstruct of what is presumed to be present in perception to the successful driver. \nThere is in this approach to the relationship between the driver and the car a clear \ndistinction between the object, which Gibson treats as a 'locomotion tool', and the \ndriver who is treated as being the agent of any ensuing action. The 'tongue' \nmetaphor, which suggests some bio-mechanical beast, is rather difficult to grasp \nfrom the perspective of a driver but makes sense as a description of how the field is \nshown in the figures in Gibson's article. These are plan drawings of road situations \nthat show the orientation of cars to each other - a view that no driver ever has but \none that is reminiscent of the view from a police helicopter or that of a child playing \nwith model cars. For some of the cars in the figures a 'tongue' shape has been drawn \nprojecting in front of the vehicle to indicate the 'field' in which the driver might expect \nto drive and have some sight of. The edges of the field are curved around obstacles \nand its furthest edge is also curved. Within the field is the 'minimum stopping zone' \nindicating the point at which the driver knows she or he could stop the vehicle. If the \nfield is characterised by a positive valence - the driver feels able to drive into it - \nobstacles have a negative valence that Gibson calls a 'halo of avoidance' that can be \nrepresented in the figures by 'lines of clearance' (Gibson 1982a: 127). These indicate \nhow a driver would attempt to maintain a safe distance; the closer their vehicle gets \nto the obstacle, the stronger the negative valence.  \nThe plan view provides a disembodied, unengaged, godlike perspective on the array \nof objects - it is an object-ive perspective that separates the car as object from the \nsubjectivity of the driver. However, Gibson's discussion of the perceptual \nengagement of the driver does make some sense. For example, the novice car driver \nhas to learn to 'anticipate the road' by extending her visual attention by hundreds of \nfeet to cover a 'field' in which potential obstructions - the parked car, the child running \n  - 7 - \ntowards the kerb - are noticed. Within this visual field the driver is more continually \nattentive than to events happening behind or to the side of the car. Events to the \nsides of the vehicle where it could not possibly be directed are not usually registered \nat all. The limited field of action of the motor car - which cannot move sideways - is \noverlooked by Gibson because his focus is on the perceiving subject, the driver. \nThis early account of the process of driving treats the driver as somehow \nindependent of the car and it's context. 'Driving' is treated as something that the \nhuman being inside the car does to the car, on the road. The process is treated as \npredominantly psychological so that the car is considered simply as a tool that is \nknown and predictable. The 'skilled driver' is also taken for granted as are the sorts of \nactivities and situations that driving involves; in fact cars, drivers, driving actions and \ndriving situations are all variable and change over time and from place to place. \nThere are two points in Gibson's account at which the centrality of the psychological \nprocess of driving is accepted as not the complete story. Firstly, he recognises that \nthe complexity of the process he is describing is way beyond conscious cognitive \ncapacity. As he points out, the driver of a vehicle overtaking another on a road with \ntwo-way traffic has to estimate the relationships between the speeds of three \nvehicles (her own, the overtaken car, the oncoming car) and their continually \nchanging fields of safe travel in relation to the stationary road. What is involved is a \nprocessing of information that Gibson remarks is \u2018astounding\u2019 (1982a: 130 fn10). \nSecondly, while through most of the discussion the car is simply taken for granted as \na 'tool of locomotion', he does in one section recognise that the car itself is: \n\u2026 also a sort of field which yields a variety of perceptual cues and \nwhich invites and supports specific actions. The impressions \nconstituting it are kinesthetic, tactual, and auditory, as well as visual, \nand they interact with the impressions from the terrain to produce the \ntotality of cues on which the driving-process is based. The \u2018feel\u2019 of the \n  - 8 - \ncar or the \u2018behavior\u2019 of the car are terms which indicate what is meant \nby this particular field of experience. \n(Gibson 1982a: 134) \nThis begins to suggest an embodied relationship between the driver and the car but \nGibson's interest in the driver was focussed; he wanted to be able to contribute as a \nscientist to the debate about what skills drivers needed and to help reduce the \nnumber of deaths on the road.  \nJames Gibson is rather more famous for his later work in ecological psychology that \nproduced the concept of 'affordance' as a way of grasping how animals, including \nhuman beings, relate to their material environment. The notion of affordance is a \ndevelopment of 'valence'  that points to the way that the materiality of an animal 'fits \nin' with some material aspect of its environment; Gibson writes of the \n'complementarity of the animal and environment' (1979: 127). An object does not \nhave affordance as a general property (such as its weight or chemical composition) \nbut affords particular things to the materiality of particular species. An armchair \naffords a bed to my cat but affords a seat to me; the cat's size and arrangement of \nlimbs means that it can curl up and sleep soundly on the soft surface. The chair is too \nsmall for me to curl up in - indeed humans do not curl up quite as cats do - but does \nprovide support for my bottom, back and arms, which is one of the ways that humans \ntake the weight off their legs and 'sit'. Affordance is then a relational (Mannheim \n1936: 254) concept rather than an absolute one and can be seen as a different \nexpression of Mead's conception of the physical objects in a field inviting human \nbeings to take up an attitude to them. Mead writes of objects such as the armchair \n'calling out' to the human being to sit in them (Mead 1962: 278-280 - see McCarthy \n1984 and Dant 1999: 120-123). Indeed, Gibson suggests that the origin of the \nconcept of affordance lies in Kurt Lewin's term Aufforderunscharakter which was \n  - 9 - \ntranslated by J. F. Brown as the 'invitation character' of an object (Gibson 1979: 138; \nMarrow 1969: 56). \nThe motor car affords the human being locomotion and mobility and it affords the \ndriver motility (the capacity to move spontaneously and independently). The \ncombination of mobility and motility that the car offers the driver is akin to that offered \nby her or his legs except that it requires little effort, is much faster and can cover \nmuch greater distances. The affordance of the motor car can be seen as a \nprogression from that of the horse as a means of transport for its rider, although the \nhorse affords mobility over rough terrain, whereas the car only affords it over fairly \nsmooth surfaces. The motor car affords mobility in a forward or backwards direction; \nunlike horses and helicopters it cannot afford sideways movement. As well as \nextending the motility of the driver\/rider, the car, like the horse, also has negative \naffordances. The horse consumes oats, the car petrol, the horse produces manure, \nthe car fumes, both take up more space than the human body, require periodic \nattention and somewhere to rest when not in use. The horse, especially in a team or \nwith a carriage, is, like the car, heavy and dangerous to other animals and objects in \nits path.  \nThe strength of the concept of affordance is that it establishes the properties of \nmaterial things in relation to a particular species. It treats the world of objects and \nmaterial forms as connected in ways that are enabled or constrained by their physical \nproperties - in this sense, it seems to ground the relation in a 'real' world, prior to any \nhuman interpretation or construction of it. For Ian Hutchby (2001), the concept of \naffordance is preferable to the textual metaphor so often employed in social \nconstruction of technology writing, because it allows for a realist, physical relation. As \nGibson himself put it: \n  - 10 - \nThe affordance of something does not change as the need of the \nobserver changes\u2026 The object does what it does because it is what it \nis. \n(Gibson 1979: 139) \nHorses and cars do not afford flying because, unlike birds and aeroplanes, they do \nnot have the physical capacity to move without a fixed surface beneath them. \nHutchby wants to incorporate the way particular objects constrain or enable particular \ncourses of human action into sociological accounts, rather than reducing such \ninteraction with objects to the accounts of what can be done with them (Hutchby \n2001: 450). The concept of affordance entails the real, physical resistance of material \nobjects to infinite variations in use by humans whereas textual metaphors open up a \npotentially limitless range of possibilities.  \nBut the realism that the concept of affordance implies is of course itself an \ninterpretation. Affordance is a post-hoc identification of possible uses by a given \nanimal; we know what an object affords because we know what it can be used for. \nOne of the major distinctions between human beings and other species is their \ncapacity for discovering the affordances of objects. This includes of course adapting, \nmodifying and designing the material world to create affordances - this is one of the \nreasons why we come to have motor cars and other animals do not. Other species \ndo do some of this discovering of affordance - as in chimps' use of grasses to extract \ntermites from a hole - but human beings interfere with the materiality of the world to \nshape it to their imaginations and their bodies. Gibson refers to this emergent quality \nof affordances as being specified in perception, in \u2018stimulus information\u2019 (1979: 140). \nBut the problem that Hutchby sees as solved by affordance is of course circular; how \nwe know that a particular object is offering a particular affordance depends on what \nwe know of that object. And what we know is as likely to be based on textual \nexperience as direct experience. So, I can know that my MGB is likely to break away \n  - 11 - \nor skid at the back at a certain speed, not because I have felt it or seen it happen but \nbecause I have read it or been told it - it is 'common knowledge' amongst MGB \ndrivers, even those who have learnt to drive on cars with more modern and forgiving \nsuspension systems, shared through conversations with other MGB owners.4 My \nvisual perception is not a complete story; it merely suggests possibilities about which \nI already know. My knowledge does not derive simply from the stimulus in \nperception, as Gibson would have us believe, because humans pass on knowledge \nin different ways from other animals.  \nGibson's concept of affordance draws us into the complex collaboration of a human \nand object assemblage such as the driver-car and it goes some way towards \nrebutting a mind \/ body dualism by situating the coordinates of physical action in the \nmaterial world and resisting a separate, cognitive, phase in which action is planned \nor programmed. Even so, it leans too heavily in favour of the perceiving human as \nthe source of agency, in particular by treating designed artefacts as essentially the \nsame as natural objects. The presence of a chair in a room is not coincidental in the \nsame way that a rock convenient for sitting on might be. Chairs are designed, made \nand placed by human beings following cultural patterns that are learnt and reinforced \ndiscursively. That a particular chair is intended for a particular person or type of \nperson may be designed into the chair (Dant 1999: 79-81) or it may only become \napparent by what one is told by someone else. So human beings not only design \nobjects to afford but also design human beings to afford; school children are taught to \nrespect the teacher's chair and not to sit in it. The object can also be designed to \nembody social relations of power - to make the user act in certain ways.5 The \nteacher's chair can be designed to be distinct from an ordinary chair so that the \npupils are in no confusion about its being just any chair that might afford them sitting \n(in my primary school, the seat of the teacher's chair was higher than ordinary, with a \nfoot ledge, so the teacher could survey the class while sitting). \n  - 12 - \nAlan Costall has tried to repair the concept of affordance by 'socialising' it (1995). He \nbegins by pointing to the extent of human intervention in the material world that has \nnot only designed in affordance but has also specified it, giving objects functions and \nmeanings. He makes the point that human beings learn affordances from each other \nand that they police each other's uses of objects such that there is a 'morality of \nthings' (Costall 1995: 473). In a later article Costall attempts to protect the concept of \naffordance from becoming too bound up in particular actions or uses with the term \n'canonical affordance': \nA chair, for example, is for sitting on, even though it may be used in \nmany other ways, e.g. as firewood or for standing upon. The meaning \nof a chair is defined by its name, sustained and revealed within certain \npractices and realized in its very construction. It is meant to be a chair. \n(Costall 1997: 79 - emphasis in original) \nThe emphasis in his assertion is not, however, sufficient to establish a cannon, \ncertainly not one that my cat is going respect when she curls up in my chair. The \npolicing of teacher's chairs and academics armchairs is achieved not simply by any \naffordance but by the use of the sharp word and the firm hand. \nCostall is trying to make the concept of affordance do more work than it can. Of \ncourse unlike material objects, the meanings of words can afford just about anything \ngiven sufficient translation, but the notion of affordance itself does not tell us anything \nabout the rather more interesting social relations with objects that Costall brings out; \ndesigning, making, adapting, learning to use, maintaining, policing and so on. Cars \nmay afford locomotion and mobility but the myriad range of ways they do it is not \nexplicated by the concept of affordance. What is more, the mobility and locomotion of \nthe car is dependent on the affordance of a driver; it would be more precise to say \nthat it is the assemblage of driver and car that affords mobility. And the complexity of \nthe relationship between driver and car has many social dimensions; it is designed, \n  - 13 - \nmade, adapted, learnt, maintained, policed, changes over time and varies with \ncultural context \nThe driver-car network \nA more complex account of the relationship between human beings and objects that \nredistributes agency between human beings and objects, is that of Actor Network \nTheory (ANT) associated with the writing of Latour, Callon, Akrich, Law and others. \nANT can be understood as a reaction to the sociologism of social studies of \ntechnology (SST) that had begun to focus on the social construction of the material \nworld of bakelite, bikes, bridges and fridges (see e.g. Mackenzie and Wacjman 1985; \nBijker, Hughes and Pinch 1987). Rather than the technical world being revealed, \ndiscovered or invented by individuals and subsequently shaping the social world, the \nsocial construction of technology (SCOT) perspective demonstrated that \ntechnological innovation was frequently shaped by particular social conditions. The \nSCOT approach emphasised the significance of a range of social actors - \nentrepreneurs, businesses, advertisers, investors, government departments, \nconsumers - as all contributing to the shaping of technological development. ANT \nsupplemented this approach in three principle ways. Firstly, it identified the social \nrelations involved in technological development as networks - the various actors \nestablish reciprocal relationships of interest and power which affect how \ntechnological development proceeds. Some local networks might be presented and \nrepresented as if they constituted a single actor in other, more global networks (Law \nand Callon 1992). Secondly, ANT emphasised the linguistic or semiotic work of \nnetworks in achieving technological development by pointing to the activities of \ninscription, description (Akrich 1992), translation (Callon 1986a) and so on. Thirdly, \nand for my purposes most importantly, ANT treated material objects as actors in \nactor networks. These 'actants' (Akrich) or 'nonhumans' (Latour) included living \norganisms (microbes \u2013 Latour 1988, scallops - Callon 1986b) as well as physical \n  - 14 - \nobjects (electric cars - Callon 1986a; transit systems - Latour 1996; lighting systems - \nAkrich 1992, aircraft - Law and Callon 1992). \nIn the tradition of SST and SCOT, ANT not only enjoys an acronym, it also focuses \non technological projects - usually failed attempts to create new systems! All three \napproaches treat material things as historically emergent and the sociological \naccount of the technology details social actions - often discursive - that take place in \nan historical sequence which is presented not as causal but as a changing context in \nwhich previous events and interventions do affect future ones. The approach is then \ndevelopmental or evolutionary; reverse engineering the sequence of social \ncircumstances to reveal the contingencies that led to a final state in the network. This \nmicro history (of a project or a technology rather than a society) reveals the social \ncharacter of changes in the material world and ANT adds to this the material \ncharacter of the physical components in the network. For example in Michel Callon's \naccount of the attempt to develop an electric car in 1970s France, in addition to \nconsumers, companies and ministries there are also \u2018\u2026 accumulators, fuel cells, \nelectrodes, electrons, catalysts and electrolytes\u2019 (1986a: 22). These material \ncomponents both contribute to the work of the network and can resist development \njust as much as social components such as organisations and cash flow. \nThe actor network is a set of links between heterogeneous elements that are durable, \neither because of human interests or physical properties, but that can be modified or \nbreak down. To lift this way of thinking of actor networks from the development of a \nnew technology to a routine experience such driving a petrol-engined car works \nremarkably well. The mobility of the driver-car is dependent on the network of the \ncar's components and the human driver's capacities; there must be sufficient cash \nflow to provide the petrol, there must be petrol available in petrol pumps nearby, the \ndriver must be able to get the petrol into the car and the engine must be in sufficiently \n  - 15 - \ngood condition for the petrol to be ignited and for combustion to be translated into \nmovement of the driver-car. \nThere is a network of driver, petrol company, petrol and car to which the humans and \nnon-humans must be contributing if the driver-car is to achieve mobility. But without \nmuch investigation it is obvious that there are all sorts of other networks entailed in \nthis basic driver \/ petrol \/ company \/ car network. So, within the car there is a network \nof spark plugs, ignition system, crankshafts, gears, transmission and so on; these \nneed to be able to translate each other's actions for drive to be achieved in the \nwheels.  And at the social level there must be no fuel protestors blocking deliveries to \npetrol stations, there must be a sufficient supply of crude oil being sold by the OPEC \ncountries and there must be a system for taxing the fuel to contribute to the social \ncosts of the driver-car. ANT has a way of dealing with the potentially infinite \nproliferation of actors and networks; it 'black-boxes' networks that appear or are \npresented as a single entity within a particular network (Callon et. al.1986: xvi; Latour \n1999: 304). So the workings of the car and the process of the petrol industry are \nblack-boxed in the routine of the filling up with petrol and driving off. These networks \nare only attended to by the driver-car when something goes wrong; when there is no \npetrol to be bought, when prices change, when the car won't start, when the \nperformance of the car is poor. \nThe concept of affordance does not offer any account of the dynamics of relations \nbetween humans and objects; it overlooks the fact that they change over time and \naccording to social context. This temporal and variable dimension is provided by \nactor network theory in which the relationship between human and object is seen to \nevolve and to bring about changes in the possibility of social action. But actor \nnetwork theory treats the relationship between humans and objects as always \nmediated through some form of language. In some cases this is the text of a report \nby an engineer or a publicity statement, at other times it is the speech of a key \n  - 16 - \nhuman actor who describes the actions of various actors in the network - including \nthe non-human ones. But very often the textual gloss is created by the actor network \ntheorist and it is articulated with an irony and playfulness that distances the reader \nfrom the activities and operations of the material objects. Even more striking is the \ngeneral absence of any attempt to explore how the human and the non-human actors \ninteract. There is no reference to video or observational data6, no account of how \nthings work or how people use them, but there are plenty of concepts, diagrams and \nallusive summarising comments. The only social action reported for all the actors in \nthe network, human and non-human, is communicative. For ANT this is always \ntreated as a process of 'translation'; human actors 'delegate' tasks to technical \nobjects and the objects operate as 'scripts' that regulate human action or act as \n'intermediaries' linking nodes in the network. ANT expands on the social and \nhistorical character of affordances but tells us little about the lived nature of human \nbeings and objects.  \nOne of Latour's examples of the merging of humans and non-humans derives from \nthe debate over whether guns kill people or whether it is the people with the guns \nwho kill: \u2018Which of them, then, the gun or the citizen, is the actor in this situation? \nSomeone else (a citizen-gun, a gun-citizen)\u2019 (1999: 179 \u2013 emphasis in original). As \nLatour points out the human agent is transformed by the possession of the gun, but \nthe gun is also transformed by being in the hand of someone willing to use it. The \nprogramme of action of both subject and object is transformed once they come \ntogether - combined they may act towards a quite different goal than either could \nhave achieved independently. It is in this sense that the assemblage of the driver-car \nbrings about a form of social being and a set of social actions that is different from \nother forms of being and action. But a problem with actor network theory and Latour's \nvarious theorisations, is that the difference between humans and non-humans is left \nunclarified. For example with the citizen-gun Latour asserts: \n  - 17 - \nPurposeful action and intentionality may not be properties of objects, \nbut they are not properties of humans either. They are properties of \ninstitutions, of apparatuses, of what Foucault called dispositifs. Only \ncorporate bodies are able to absorb the proliferation of mediators, to \nregulate their expression, to redistribute skills, to force boxes to \nblacken and close\u2026 Boeing 747s do not fly, airlines fly. \n(Latour 1999: 192-3) \nThis is a strange formulation for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is unclear what birds \nare doing when they fly, or the individual owner\/pilot - it is not a requirement of flying \n(or car-driving) that there be an institution or corporate body. Having a gun licence, a \npilot's licence or a driving licence indicates a dispositif that sanctions certain actions \nbut does not, for example, initiate it or direct them. Secondly, the human is, like the \nbird, itself an object - it is embodied. This means that it acts as an entity in itself - it is \ncorporate in itself, has 'non-human' properties as well as 'human' ones. Thirdly, the \ndisposition to act does not need to be reduced to a single mental act, a motivation for \nexample, for it to be attributed to a person; a body that exercises intentions. Fourthly, \nLatour is threatening the possibility of free will, of intentionality and the operation of \nchoice, which is normally taken to reside in human beings but not in objects.  \nThe car itself may 'act' (by going slowly or pulling to the left) but we do not attribute \nthis to the intention or choice of the car (or the engine, or the steering). Of course, \nsome non-humans do have a measure of intentionality and the riders of horses will \nattribute the slowness of the horse to its intentionality (reluctance to ride away from \nfood and home, keeness to ride towards food and home\u2026).7 But objects that are \nlifeless, especially artificial objects like cars, do not have any intentionality of their \nown. However, one of the features of artificial objects is that they are made by people \nwho do have intentions. These intentions are designed and made into the object. In \nthis sense, all non-humans become imbued with human intentionality; guns are \n  - 18 - \nintended for killing, cars for driving. Horses, once trained, fed and saddled, become \nnon-humans that have taken on some human intentionality for riding. One of Latour's \nfavourite examples is the 'sleeping policeman' or speed bump, an object which \npolices the use of cars (1992: 244; 1999: 188)8 by clearly interrupting the normally \nsmooth surface of the road causing the car to bounce if it is driven over the bump too \nfast. For Latour the 'actant' of the speed bump 'slows down cars or damages them' \n(1999:188); it works as a 'delegation' because it 'stands in for an actor and creates \nan asymmetry between absent makers and occasional users' (1999: 189). Another \nrather simpler and ordinary way of expressing this is to suggest that the intentions of \nthe local authority to persuade cars to slow down are built into the object. That it is \nintended is demonstrated by its building; it is straight and of consistent dimensions, \noften marked by lines or triangles and often accompanied by warning signs at eye \nheight. It is not likely to be confused with an unintentional bump such as one caused \nby poor road laying, even though the effect on the vehicle may be exactly the same. \nLatour, in keeping with the tradition of the sociology of science, is keen to claim \nsymmetry between human and non-human. But just because the actions of people \noften occur within the shaping and limiting context of institutions does not mean that \nhumans are equivalent with non-humans. Latour's enthusiasm for recognising the \nsignificance of non-humans draws our attention to the contribution that they make to \nhuman lives, history and society. His aim of recognising how humans and non-\nhumans are enfolded is interesting and persuasive. But despite his analysis of the \nfailed Aramis transport system that Latour describes as a 'car-without-a-driver', an \n'assemblage of things' (1996: 57) and 'a quasi-object, quasi-subject' (1996: 213), he \nleaves much unsaid about the routine, everyday, lived, embodied relationships \nbetween human beings and the material objects around them. \n  - 19 - \nThe embodied driver-car \nMaurice Merleau-Ponty argues against a cognitive understanding of perception to \nshow that the senses cannot be understood as machinic receptors that interface \nbetween an inner being and the outer world. What his phenomenology upsets is the \n\u2018common sense\u2019 notion of the outer world having a fixed geometry and stable order of \nrelations that are given to human beings through their senses. Instead he shows that \nperception is situated and oriented to the kinaesthetic awareness of body so that, as \nhe puts it, the body is \u2018geared\u2019 to the world which is how it becomes available to the \nsenses. This way of understanding the embodied experience of the material world \nemphasises that the continuity of the world is because our bodies have a history of \nsensuous experience that we carry into the next moment. Merleau-Ponty sums up \nthe embodiment of human being like this: \nThere is, therefore, another subject beneath me, for whom a world \nexists before I am here, and who marks out my place in it. This captive \nor natural spirit is my body, not that momentary body which is the \ninstrument of my personal choices and which fastens upon this or that \nworld, but the system of anonymous \u2018functions\u2019 which draw every \nparticular focus into a general project. \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 254) \nHe goes on to point out that this embodied orientation to the world that human beings \ncarry into each moment, is not simply given at birth but is perpetually modified. Put \nthis way we can see that the human component in an assemblage such as that of the \ndriver-car brings to the relationship qualities that cannot be read off from either the \nmechanical or sense functions of the body.  \nMerleau-Ponty's understanding of perception is not dependent on individual senses \ngenerating disembodied information but on the mutual effect of all the body's senses \n  - 20 - \nbringing about a state of perception that depends on bodily memory.9  What Gibson \nsaw as 'astounding' in the way that a driver can process information while overtaking \nis of course routine for people who drive regularly on two-lane major roads. The \nperception of road, other moving objects and embodied movement depends not on \nprocessing data as a machine would, but through experiencing the process in \nrelation to bodily memory. For Merleau-Ponty the relationship between us and the \nphenomenal world of experience is best understood as like 'communicating' with it: \n\u2026 every perception is a communication or a communion, the taking \nup or completion by us of some extraneous intention or, on the other \nhand, the complete expression outside ourselves of our perceptual \npowers and a coition, so to speak, of our body with things. \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 320) \nNonetheless, a key communication between driver, car and road depends on visual \nability; lack of sight is a bodily deficit that cannot, yet, be compensated for. The driver \nlooks out from their seat in the car through a quadrant10 at the world rushing towards \nher at a variety of speeds. Whereas for Gibson (1982b) it is a matter of the way that \nthe image of the world is deformed on the retina of the eye as it moves through \nspace, for Merleau-Ponty visual perception is an orientation of the whole body to the \nworld through which it moves.11 What is perceived in the visual field is complemented \nby the kinaesthesia of the body and its trajectory as a whole, by the sounds of the \nengine, the road and the wind on the car, by the resistance of steering wheel, \naccelerator and brakes - even the feel of the road through the wheels of the car. So, \nour visual perception of the 'sleeping policeman', or even the sign indicating the \npresence of speed bumps, is tied to previous experience of the feel of the car going \nover bumps.  \nTo think of driving as requiring the processing of enormously complex information \nselected and filtered through the visual field, sufficient for safe control of the vehicle, \n  - 21 - \nmakes it seem astounding. Yet it is a readily achieved skill by most human beings - \nvery few people cannot learn to drive provided they have sight. The process of \ndriving is largely habitual12, an embodied skill which becomes a taken for granted \nway of moving through space \u2013 it is at between, roughly, thirty and seventy miles an \nhour that the driver-car in modern societies conquers space. Many competent drivers \nfind slow speed driving difficult and disorienting and exceeding their usual top speed \ndisconcerting. The gearing and steering mechanisms of most cars are also designed \nto work best within this speed range. The driver's sense of how fast they are going \nand what speed the road conditions will permit, becomes a skill embodied through \nthe vehicle, not only its dials and controls but also its sounds and vibrations. Merleau-\nPonty describes how the feather in a woman's hat, a blind man's stick and the driver \nof a car, are objects incorporated for the action in hand: \nTo get used to a hat, a car, a stick is to be transplanted into them, or \nconversely, to incorporate them into the bulk of our own body. Habit \nexpresses our power of dilating our being-in-the-world, or changing \nour existence by appropriating fresh instruments. \n(Merleau-Ponty 1962: 143) \nSo the human driver is habitually embodied within the car as an assemblage that can \nachieve automobility.13 The driver-car can take on board friends, family, pets, \nshopping, a change of tyre, a change of clothing, as it moves into the world of roads, \nsigns, other cars, buildings and so on. \nThe embodied orientation to a world of rapidly moving objects from a sitting but \nrapidly moving position is something that must be learnt.14 Just as the child learns to \nwalk, to run, to ride a bike and in so doing expands her or his engagement with the \nphysical world, so the young person learning to drive will delight in that shift in their \nembodied relationship with the world that goes with driving the car, moving at a \nspeed impossible without assistance to the body. For Merleau-Ponty perception in \n  - 22 - \nmovement, such as that necessary for driving, is dependent on orientation to varied \nfixed points - such as the road, lampposts, the dashboard, other vehicles. He says \n'\u2026 motion is a phenomenon of levels, every movement presupposing a certain \nanchorage which is variable' (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 279). Perception in movement is \nnot about the objective judgement of distance and speed but about noting the \nchanges from one moment to the next. \nSome people seek such transformations of bodily experience simply for its own \npleasure; the modern horse rider, the windsurfer, paraglider and so on. But driving a \ncar is an experience that becomes entwined, for most drivers, in everyday practice \nsuch that it becomes ordinary and the re-orientation of the body to the rest of the \nmaterial world ceases to be remarkable or pleasurable in itself.15 Of course there are \npeople for whom this type of transformation of bodily experience in the world is \nunbearable \u2013 they are unable to overcome their fear and disorientation and so avoid \nthe experience of driving.  \nThe embodied orientation to being in a fast moving object in a restricted space with \nother fast moving objects is a cultural phenomenon that has become characteristic of \nlate modern societies. The driver assembles their learnt skill with the functionality of a \ncar so as to be able to \u2018enter a narrow opening and see that I can \u201cget through\u201d \nwithout comparing the width of the opening with that of the wings, just as I go through \na doorway without checking the width of the doorway against my body\u2019 (Merleau-\nPonty 1962: 143). For most people in late modernity the experience of the driver-car \nbecomes an aspect of bodily experience that they carry into all their other \nperceptions and engagements with the material world in a way that they take for \ngranted and treat as unremarkable. The car does not simply afford the driver mobility \nor have independent agency as an actant; it enables a range of humanly embodied \nactions available only to the driver-car.\n  - 23 - \nConclusions \nThe driver-car is neither a thing nor a person; it is an assembled social being that \ntakes on properties of both and cannot exist without both. I have argued that to \nunderstand driving as dependent on the mechanics of perception puts the emphasis \non the presumed cognitive capacities of human beings whereas the concept of \n'affordance' suggests that there is a prior physical relationship. But to treat the car as \noffering affordance to its driver obscures the complex social process in which human \nintentionality creates affordances in objects such as cars - and in human beings such \nas drivers. Actor network theory begins to open up the social history of connections \nbetween human beings and objects that bring about technical systems such as the \ndriver-car. But ANT transforms such interactive and embodied relationships into ones \nthat are textual and symmetrical and threatens to attribute equivalent agency to \nhumans and nonhumans. Affordance hints at a dualism between mind and body that \nANT counters forcefully but ANT overlooks the materiality of bodies, and the \nintentionality of subjectivity under the cover of dragging all materiality equally into \nsociety. I have argued that Merleau-Ponty recognises the embodied and intentional \nnature of human relationships with objects without putting the apparatus of \nperception between minds and the material world. The assemblage of the driver-car \nproduces the possibility of action that once it becomes routine, habitual and \nubiquitous becomes an ordinary form of embodied social action. People who have \nbecome familiar with the driver-car through participating in the assemblage become \noriented to their social world, partly at least, through the forms of action of which it is \ncapable. Social institutions \u2013 legal systems, the conventions of driving, traffic \nmanagement \u2013 develop to embed the coordinated habits of driver-cars within the \nsocial fabric. The use of cars is not then simply functional, a matter of convenience, \nnor is it reducible to individual, conscious decision. Like the wearing of clothes or \nfollowing conventions of politeness, the actions of the driver-car have become a \n  - 24 - \nfeature of the flow of daily social life that cannot simply removed or phased out (like \ndangerous drivers or leaded petrol). \nAs political concern responds to the threats to life and environment of the car \npowered by fossil fuels, it is important to recognise that the car is not simply a mode \nof transport and that any call for a \u2018shift\u2019 to more ecologically sound mobility requires \nmuch more than rational choice about the consequences of different forms of \ntransport. The automobility that is realised in the driver-car serves as both an \nextension of the human body and an extension of technology and society into the \nhuman. The driver-car is socially embedded as a system of affordances, actor \nnetworks and embodiment that is not going to be foregone or forgotten easily. The \nobject of the car is likely to undergo a dramatic transformation within the next few \ndecades,16 yet even if the weight, body shape, controls, engine and fuel are \ntransformed, it seems likely that the driver-car will continue to include an object on \nwheels in which a human being can sit and, with simple adjustments of peripheral \nlimbs, steer and direct to go faster or slower. Both the technology of the motor car \nand the skills and techniques of the driver may be superseded or improved \u2013 as have \nthe horse \/ rider and walker \/ shoe \u2013 but some form of driver-car is likely to remain. \nThe symbiotic relationship between driver and car is one that has transformed the \nmaterial environment and the nature of sociality in late modern societies (see Dant \nand Martin 2001) and it is unlikely that it will be put aside easily. The empirical nature \nof the driver-car \u2013 including its status as a form of mobility capital17 \u2013 deserves urgent \nstudy so that policy discussions take into account what is entailed in bringing about a \n\u2018modal shift\u2019 to more sustainable forms of transport and mobility. The study of the \ndriver-car will also contribute to an understanding of the various assemblages that \nintermediate between the persons and societies of the late modern world. \n  - 25 - \n References \nAltshuler, A.; Anderson, M.; Jones, D.; Roos, D.; Womack, J.

Nonetheless, Michel Callon writes that the \nscallops in St. Brieuc bay \u2018must first be willing to anchor themselves\u2019 (1986: 211) yet in what \nfollows there is no account of how the scallops exercise intention or will. Because the \nscallops' resistance to anchoring is not consistent - some do, some don't - Callon is able to \nimpute intention to their individual behaviour, as if the scallops were exercising intention. \nSince scientists count the number of anchoring larvae Callon treats the process as \nsymmetrical with the election of representatives. He might as well treat the counting of road \ndeaths as equivalent to the election of representatives. Electors demonstrate intention in their \n  - 31 - \n                                                \naction, scallops that anchor and people who die on the roads are succumbing to \ncircumstances independently of their intentions. \n8 Latour claims that the bump in the road known as a sleeping policeman 'does not resemble \none in the least' (1999: 188). I've always fondly imagined a policeman asleep under the \ntarmac, causing an elongated and solid lump much as if he was under a duvet. Another way \nof thinking of it is that the effect on the car is much the same as if one had driven over a \npoliceman. \n9 'The body is borne towards tactile experience by all its surfaces and all its organs \nsimultaneously, and carries with it a certain typical structure of the tactile \u201cworld\u201d' (Merleau \nPonty 1962: 317) \n10 Car windscreens are nowadays usually curved and slanted, indicating the driver\u2019s visual \nzone of attention as much as significantly improving airflow. \n11 Sight may lead this orientation to other objects so the driver's eye may take a 'hold' on an \nobject and has a 'certain power of making contact with things' but their visual presentation 'is \nnot a screen on which they are projected' (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 279) as a train passenger's \nview might be construed. \n12 '\u2026 habit \u2026 is knowledge in the hands, which is forthcoming only when bodily effort is \nmade, and cannot be formulated in detachment from that effort' (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 144). \n13 Don Ihde suggests that the car becomes a symbiotic extension of the body of the driver \n(1974: 272).  \n14 'Motion is a modulation of an already familiar setting.' (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 277). \n15 Although there are of course many people who take pleasure in dealing with cars and \ndriving as is shown by the range of car magazines and television programmes devoted to \ncars (but not washing machines and other less pleasurable objects). Many people gain \npleasure from driving \u2013 but there is no reason to suggest that the nonhuman components in \nthe assemblage gain any such pleasure.  \n  - 32 - \n                                                \n16 See for example the fascinating discussion of the Hypercar in Hawken, Lovins and Lovins \n1999. \n17 The driver-car represents an accumulation of physical, financial and social resources that is \ncontrolled by an individual but operates in the public context of roads, traffic systems and \ntaxes. A study of the variations in the mobility capital entailed in the driver-car would bring out \nits inflected forms (gendered, aged, culturally specific, powerful, protected and so on) as well \nas providing a basis for comparison with other mobile beings such as the passenger, the \npedestrian and the cyclist. It would also highlight the social exclusion that results from relative \nlack of access to mobility capital. \n"}
