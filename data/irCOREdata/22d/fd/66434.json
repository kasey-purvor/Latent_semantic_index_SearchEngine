Aharonian et al.: H.E.S.S. observations of PKS 2155\u2212304\nAbstract. The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2155\u2212304 at redshift z = 0.117 has been detected with high significance (\u223c45\u03c3) at\nenergies greater than 160 GeV, using the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic array of imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes in Namibia. A strong signal is found\nin each of the data sets corresponding to the dark periods of July and October, 2002, and June\u2013September, 2003. The observed flux of VHE\ngamma rays shows variability on time scales of months, days, and hours. The monthly-averaged integral flux above 300 GeV varies between\n10% and 60% of the flux observed from the Crab Nebula. Energy spectra are measured for these individual periods of data taking and are\ncharacterized by a steep power law with a time-averaged photon index of \u0393 = 3.32 \u00b1 0.06. An improved \u03c72 per degree of freedom is found\nwhen either a power law with an exponential cutoff energy or a broken power law are fit to the time-averaged energy spectrum. However, the\nsignificance of the improvement is marginal (\u223c2\u03c3). The suggested presence of features in the energy spectrum may be intrinsic to the emission\nfrom the blazar, or an indication of absorption of TeV gamma rays by the extragalactic infrared background light.\nKey words. galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 2155\u2212304 \u2013 gamma rays: observations\n1. Introduction\nThe high-frequency peaked BL Lac (HBL) object\nPKS 2155\u2212304 (z = 0.117) was discovered by the HEAO 1\nX-ray satellite (Griffiths et al. 1979; Schwartz et al. 1979)\nat a position consistent with a poorly localized detection\nby the Ariel V satellite (Cooke et al. 1978). PKS 2155\u2212304\nis now known to be one of the brightest extragalactic\nX-ray sources in the sky and as a result other X-ray satel-\nlites, including ROSAT, BeppoSAX, RXTE, and Chandra\n(see, e.g., Brinkmann et al. 1994; Chiappetti & Torroni 1997;\nVestrand & Sreekumar 1999; Nicastro et al. 2002), have de-\ntected it on a regular basis. PKS 2155\u2212304 is well studied and\nhas a history of strong broad-band variability. It is associated\nwith a compact, flat-spectrum radio source, and exhibits\nan essentially featureless continuum from radio to X-ray\nfrequencies. The maximum power emitted by PKS 2155\u2212304\nis between the UV and soft X-ray range, and it is the brightest\nBL Lac detected in the UV regime (Wandel & Urry 1991).\nGamma-ray emission in the energy range 30 MeV to 10 GeV\nwas detected from PKS 2155\u2212304 by the EGRET detec-\ntor aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory satellite\n(Vestrand et al. 1995). The EGRET observations indicated a\nhard energy spectrum with integral power-law photon index of\n1.71 \u00b1 0.24. All of these characteristics make PKS 2155\u2212304\na likely emitter of >100 GeV gamma rays. In fact, it was\ndetected at energies greater than 300 GeV in 1996 and 1997\nby the University of Durham Mark 6 Telescope as reported in\nChadwick et al. (1999a). However, the object was not detected\nby the same instrument in 1998 (Chadwick et al. 1999b).\nFurthermore, PKS 2155\u2212304 was not detected by the\nCANGAROO experiment during observations made in 1997\n(Roberts et al. 1999), 1999 (Nishijima et al. 2001), 2000 or\n2001 (Nakase et al. 2003). The reported upper limit from\nCANGAROO in 1997 is consistent with the flux detected by\nDurham, and the lack of a detection of PKS 2155\u2212304 at TeV\nenergies in subsequent years is not inconsistent with the fact\nthat such emission from AGN is known to be highly variable.\nThe present confirmation of the detection of VHE gamma-\nrays from PKS 2155\u2212304 by the High Energy Stereoscopic\nSystem (H.E.S.S.) along with observations at other wave-\nlengths will yield considerable insight into the mechanisms for\nTeV gamma-ray emission from blazars, help delineate the dif-\nferences between low-frequency peaked BL Lacs and HBLs,\nand will assist in the understanding of the extragalactic infrared\nbackground light (EBL). This latter point is strengthened by the\nfact that PKS 2155\u2212304 is the second most distant object de-\ntected at TeV energies and therefore its energy spectrum may\nexhibit characteristics, such as steepening of the spectrum and a\ncutoff, caused by absorption of VHE gamma rays via pair pro-\nduction on the EBL. The most distant object detected at TeV\nenergies, 1ES 1426+428 (z = 0.129), showed features in its\nenergy spectrum which have been interpreted as consequences\nof such absorption (Aharonian et al. 2002a). In addition, vari-\nability studies using detailed light curves obtained from obser-\nvations of PKS 2155\u2212304 can place strong constraints on the\nphysical modeling of blazars.\n2. H.E.S.S. detector\nThe H.E.S.S. experiment has been operating since June,\n2002, in the Khomas Highlands of Namibia (23\u25e616\u203218\u2032\u2032 S,\n16\u25e630\u20321\u2032\u2032 E, 1835 m above sea level). The detector consists of\na system of four imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes in a square\nof 120 m side. Each individual telescope is an alt-az mount\nDavies-Cotton reflector (Davies & Cotton 1957) with a flat-to-\nflat width of 13 m, and has a camera mounted at the focal length\nof 15 m. The total mirror area of each telescope is 107 m2,\nsegmented into 382 individual round (60 cm diameter) front-\naluminized glass mirrors. The H.E.S.S. cameras provide a 5\u25e6\nfield of view and contain 960 individual photomultiplier (PMT)\npixels subtending 0.16\u25e6 each, with Winston cone light concen-\ntrators. The camera is modular in design, housing 60 drawers\nof 16 PMTs each, and contains all the necessary electronics\nfor operation, triggering, and readout. The trigger electronics\ndivide the camera into overlapping 64 PMT sectors (4 adja-\ncent drawers) with a trigger requirement that a sector has a\nminimum number of pixels with a signal above a threshold in\nphotoelectrons (PEs) coincident in an effective \u223c1.3 ns trigger\nwindow. Upon receiving a camera trigger, the signal stored in\nanalog memories from each of the PMTs, sampled at 1 GHz, is\nintegrated within a 16 ns window. Once a camera has triggered,\na signal is sent out via an optical fiber to a central trigger system\n(Funk et al. 2004) which allows for a multiple telescope coin-\ncidence requirement. More details on H.E.S.S. can be found in\nBernl\u00f6hr et al. (2003); Hofmann (2003); Vincent et al. (2003).\n3. Observations\nThe H.E.S.S. observations of PKS 2155\u2212304 were made while\nthe system was under construction, therefore the data cover\nF.

The exception to this is in September 2003,\nwhen a third telescope was added to the array. The fourth and\nfinal telescope was added to the array in December 2003, after\nthe end of the observation season for PKS 2155\u2212304.\nThe trigger for H.E.S.S. has similarly evolved. During the\nobservations in July, October, November 2002, and June 2003,\nthe sector trigger consisted of a requirement for 4 pixels each\nwith more than 6.7 PEs. However, the July and October 2002\nobservations were made with only the inner 30 and 52 drawers,\nrespectively, participating in the trigger while the entire cam-\nera was used for image collection. For all later observations the\ncameras were used fully. The system level trigger was installed\nin July 2003. Before this time two-telescope data were taken\nwith each telescope separately, and the stereo multiplicity re-\nquirement (two telescopes) was performed off-line (\u201cSoftware\nStereo\u201d) using GPS time stamps. After the installation of the\ncentral trigger system the stereo multiplicity requirement was\nperformed in the hardware (\u201cHardware Stereo\u201d). As the system\nrate was considerably lower due to a two-telescope multiplicity\nrequirement, the sector trigger requirement could be lowered to\n3 pixels with more than 5.3 PEs, allowing for a lower energy\nthreshold. This increased the individual telescope rates, from\n\u223c250 Hz to \u223c800 Hz, while maintaining a reduced system dead\ntime.\nTable 1 gives details of the observations of PKS 2155\u2212304\nby H.E.S.S. which pass conservative run selection criteria.\nThese run selection criteria remove runs for which the sky was\nnot clear and where the telescopes were not operating within\nspecified requirements (e.g., trigger rate stability, more than\n95% of the camera pixels operational). All the single tele-\nscope observation runs were taken in On\u2013Off mode. Here, data\nwere taken on source for 25 min, preceded or followed by off-\nsource observations, used to estimate the background. These\noff-source observations differ by \u00b130 min in right ascension\n(RA) from the actual source position. Given an approximately\n5 min (reduced to 2 min after 2002) transition time for the data\nacquisition system, this ensures that the on and off runs have\nidentical azimuth and altitude profiles. The stereo data were\ntaken in 28 min runs using Wobble mode. In this mode, the\nsource direction is positioned \u00b10.5\u25e6 in declination relative to\nthe center of the field of view of the camera during observa-\ntions. The sign of the offset is alternated in successive scans\nto reduce systematic effects. Due to the large field of view of\nthe H.E.S.S. cameras, use of Wobble mode allows for both on-\nsource observations and simultaneous estimation of the back-\nground induced by charged cosmic rays, since the background\ncan be estimated from different regions in the same field of\nview. This eliminates the need for off-source observations and\ntherefore doubles the amount of time available for on-source\nobservations.\n4. Technique\n4.1. Event reconstruction\nThe analysis of the data passing the run selection criteria pro-\nceeds in the following steps: first the images are calibrated\n(Aharonian et al. 2004) and then \u201ccleaned\u201d to remove noise\nfrom the image. The image cleaning is done using a two-\nstage tail-cut procedure which requires a pixel to have a signal\ngreater than 10 PEs and a neighboring pixel to have a signal\nlarger than 5 PEs. Also pixels greater than 5 PEs are included\nif they have a neighbor greater than 10 PEs. After this im-\nage cleaning is performed, the moments of the shower image\nare parameterized using a Hillas-type analysis (Hillas 1985).\nThe shower geometry is reconstructed using stereoscopic tech-\nniques (Aharonian et al. 1999b) with a typical angular resolu-\ntion of \u223c0.1\u25e6 and an average accuracy of \u223c10 m in the determi-\nnation of the shower core location. To ensure that the analyzed\nimages are not truncated by the edge of the camera, only im-\nages which pass a distance cut requiring the image center of\ngravity to be less than 2\u25e6 from the center of the camera are\nused in the reconstruction. For the stereo configuration a min-\nimum of 2 telescopes meeting this criterion are required for a\nsuccessful reconstruction. In addition, at least two telescopes\nare each required to exceed a minimum total signal to ensure\nthat the images are well reconstructed. The analysis techniques\nare similar for the mono-configurations, although a necessary\ndifference arises in the determination of the shower geometry.\n868 F.

To do\nthis, the angular distance, along the major axis of the recon-\nstructed ellipse, from the image center of gravity to the point\nof origin of the event is estimated using the image parameter\nconstruction length\/log (size) (Masterson 2000).\n4.2. Background rejection\nAfter the event reconstruction, the much more numerous\ncosmic-ray background events are rejected using cuts on mean\nreduced scaled width (MRSW) and length (MRSL) parameters.\nThese parameters are defined as the mean of the difference in\nstandard deviations for each telescope of the width (length) ob-\nserved in the image from that which is expected from gamma-\nray simulations (\u3008width\u3009 and \u03c3) based on image intensity, re-\nconstructed impact parameter and zenith angle of observations.\nThe equation for MRSW is as follows:\nMRS W = 1\nNtel\nNtel\u2211\ni=0\nwidthi \u2212 \u3008width\u3009i\n\u03c3i\n, (1)\nand is similar for MRSL. Images from muons are rejected by\nrequiring events be coincident in at least 2 telescopes in the\nstereo configuration or by using a cut on length divided by size\nof the image, after image cleaning, for the mono-configuration\n(Catanese et al. 1995). A cut on \u03b82, the square of the angular\ndifference between the reconstructed shower position and the\nsource position, is applied and is equivalent to placing the data\ninto a round bin centered on the source position. All the cuts\n(shown in Table 2) are optimized a priori (simultaneously) to\nyield the maximum expected significance per hour of observa-\ntion. The data used for optimization consists of Monte Carlo\ngamma-ray simulations at a zenith angle of 20\u25e6 with a Crab-\nlike energy spectrum (spectral index = 2.6, 1\/2 Crab flux) and\nreal off-source data. The percentage of gamma-rays and cosmic\nrays retained by the cuts is also shown in Table 2. The signifi-\ncance expected (and observed) is not strongly dependent on the\nexact values of the cuts used. For each of the various hardware\nconfigurations a different set of cuts is used, all optimized on\nMonte Carlo simulations and comparable off-source data sets.\n4.3. Background estimation\nFor mono-telescope observations the background is estimated\nfrom the number of events passing the selection cuts at the\ncenter of the field of view during off-source observations. The\nbackground is then normalized using the ratio of dead time cor-\nrected observation time. For the stereo (Wobble) observations\nTable 3. Shown are the number of on-source and off-source events\npassing the cuts, the normalization for the off-source events, the ob-\nserved excess from PKS 2155\u2212304, and the significance of the excess\nfor each of the dark periods.\nDark Sig.\nPeriod Ntels On Off Norm Excess [\u03c3]\n07\/2002 1 637 234 1.063 388 13.0\n10\/2002 1 865 519 1.065 312 8.2\n11\/2002 1 80 90 0.896 \u22120.65 \u22120.1\n06\/2003 2 1396 4619 0.152 694 21.1\n07\/2003 2 3169 13 643 0.147 1164 22.1\n08\/2003 2 3369 12 955 0.147 1459 27.7\n09\/2003 2 185 697 0.148 82 6.7\n09\/2003 3 1005 3946 0.147 425 14.7\nTotal Stereo 43.8\nTotal All 44.9\nthe background is estimated using all events passing cuts in a\nring around the source location. The distance from the source\nposition to the radial center of the ring is 0.5\u25e6, and the width\nof the ring is adjusted such that the area of the ring is approx-\nimately seven times the area of the on-source region. The nor-\nmalization of the off-source event total is corrected for the ra-\ndial acceptance of the camera. The use of a larger background\nregion in this ring technique reduces the relative statistical er-\nror on the background measurement. After the number of on-\nsource and background events passing the selection cuts are de-\ntermined, the significance of the excess is calculated following\nthe method of Eq. (17) in Li & Ma (1983).\n5. Detection of PKS 2155\u2212304\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is strongly detected in all the dark periods in\nwhich it was observed with the exception of November 2002\nwhere the exposure was less than one hour. Table 3 shows the\nresults of the H.E.S.S. observations for each of the individual\ndark periods. The total significance of the excess for all obser-\nvations is 44.9\u03c3.

The agreement is good and\nshows that the simulations accurately characterize the detector\nresponse and that the detector performs as expected. In partic-\nular, the agreement of the \u03b82 distribution demonstrates that the\npoint spread function (width < 0.1\u25e6) is well understood.\n6. Energy spectrum\n6.1. Technique\nThe energy of observed gamma rays, Efit, is calculated using\nthe mean of the energies estimated for each telescope with a\ntypical event resolution of \u223c15%. Each of the individual en-\nergy estimates use the image size, impact parameter2 of the\nevent, and the zenith angle of observation (Z) for each tele-\nscope. The energy estimates are based on results from Monte\nCarlo gamma-ray simulations. For the determination of the en-\nergy spectrum the data are logarithmically binned (8 bins per\ndecade) in energy. However, only bins for which the average\nbias in Efit is less than 10% are used, effectively placing a\nlower energy threshold on suitable events. This is done to elim-\ninate any systematic effects that might arise because energy\nestimates for events near the trigger threshold yield, on aver-\nage, too large an energy. The range of bins used varies for each\nindividual run due to the zenith angle of observation and re-\nsults in the bins at lower energies having differing amounts\nof exposure. For each event passing cuts the effective area,\nAeff(Efit, Z), is individually determined. The influence of the fi-\nnite energy resolution has been taken into account in the effec-\ntive areas which are fit as a function of Z and Efit for each of\nthe various observation configurations similar to the method in\nMohanty et al. (1998). For each bin, the sum of 1\/ Aeff, is cal-\nculated for both on-source (Oi) and off-source (Bi) events using\nonly events from the appropriate runs. Each bin in the spectrum\nthen contains:\nFi =\n(Oi \u2212 Bi)\n\u2206Eiti\n, (2)\nwhere ti and \u2206Ei are the exposure time and width in energy re-\nspectively for that bin. As the collection area depends weakly\non the spectral shape assumed, an iterative procedure is fol-\nlowed, where the initial spectral shape is assumed to be flat\nin \u03bdF\u03bd (differential power-law index = 2.0). When deviations\nfrom this hypothesis are found the collection area is recalcu-\nlated using the previous result and the spectrum is determined\nagain. This procedure continues until convergence (typically\n1\u20132 iterations).\n6.2.

The dashed lines in Fig. 4 show the best \u03c72 fit\nto the data of Eq. (3) for the corresponding spectrum. Table 4\nshows the best fit results, integral flux (above several thresh-\nolds) determined from the fit parameters, and comparisons of\nthese integral fluxes to those measured by H.E.S.S. from the\nCrab Nebula. Due to the steeper spectral index determined for\nPKS 2155\u2212304 (\u0393crab = 2.63 \u00b1 0.05), the percentage of the re-\nspective Crab fluxes in an individual darkness period is larger\nfor lower thresholds. Although the level of VHE emission from\nAGN is known to be variable, the integral flux above 300 GeV\nmeasured for each of the observation periods shows reasonable\nagreement with the result reported by Chadwick et al. (1999a),\nI(>300 GeV) = (4.2 \u00b1 0.75stat \u00b1 2.0syst) \u00d7 10\u22127 m\u22122 s\u22121. In ad-\ndition to the method described above, an alternative forward-\nfolding method, used by CAT (Piron et al. 2001), was also ap-\nplied to quantify the individual spectra and yields very similar\nresults to those shown in Table 4.\n6.3. Time-averaged spectrum\nA time-averaged energy spectrum from all the stereo (2003)\ndata is shown in Fig. 5. The mono-telescope data set is not\nincluded for two reasons: the average flux level in 2002 is\nconsiderably higher than the rest of the data set. More impor-\ntantly, the energy is more poorly determined for the mono-\ntelescope data set and thus the determination of the spectrum\nis more susceptible to systematic errors. A fit of the stereo data\nset to a power law yields \u0393 = 3.32 \u00b1 0.06, I0 = (1.96 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7\n10\u22128 m\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121, and a \u03c72 of 10.8 for 7 degrees of freedom.\nOnly the statistical errors are presented. Although the \u03c72 for\nthe power law fits to the spectra for individual dark periods is\nreasonable, the \u03c72 for the time-averaged spectrum corresponds\nto a probability of 0.148. In addition, the power law fit to the\ntime-averaged spectrum is above the 90% upper limit on the\ndifferential flux at 3 TeV (not included in the fit). Since this\ninformation indicates that a power law is not a good character-\nization of the data, the energy spectrum is fit to two alternative\nhypotheses. The first is a power law with an exponential cutoff:\ndN\ndE = I0\n(\nE\nE0\n)\u2212\u0393\ne\u2212\nE\nEcut , (4)\nwhere Ecut is the cutoff energy, and I0, E0, and \u0393 are as de-\nfined above. The fit yields an improved \u03c72 of 6.2 for 6 de-\ngrees of freedom (probability = 0.40), and the fit curve falls\nbelow all upper limits at higher energies. The best fit values\nare: \u0393 = 2.90+0.21\u22120.23, I0 = (4.0+1.9\u22121.2) \u00d7 10\u22128 m\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121, and\nEcut = 1.4+0.8\u22120.7 TeV. The large errors (only statistical errors are\nshown) on the fit values are the result of strong correlations be-\ntween the parameters used to characterize the spectral shape.\nF.

The best fit values are: \u03931 = 3.15+0.10\u22120.12,\nI0 = (2.4+0.4\u22120.3) \u00d7 10\u22128 m\u22122 s\u22121 TeV\u22121, \u03932 = 3.79+0.46\u22120.27, and\nEbreak = 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 TeV.

Since PKS 2155\u2212304 was not detected in November\n2002, a 99% upper limit of I(>300 GeV) = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22127 m\u22122 s\u22121\nwas determined by the method of Helene (1983) assuming the\n2003 time-averaged spectral index, \u0393 = 3.32. The upper limit,\nshown in Fig. 6, is below the flux values from earlier in 2002,\nbut higher than the average flux for the entire data set.\nThe fit of the spectral index versus period to a constant\nyields a \u03c72 of 7.1 for 5 degrees of freedom, corresponding to a\n0.21 \u03c72 probability, which is marginally consistent with being\nconstant. Since the fit data points include only the statistical\nerrors, the \u03c72 will be smaller with the inclusion of systematic\nerrors (\u223c0.1 for the spectral index). Therefore, there is no ev-\nidence that the spectral index of PKS 2155\u2212304 varies with\ntime. However, the evidence also does not rule out possible\ntemporal variability in the spectral index during the aforemen-\ntioned large changes in flux.\nA correlation between harder spectra and higher flux val-\nues might be expected for PKS 2155\u2212304, since this trend\nwas demonstrated for Mkn 421 (Aharonian et al. 2002b) and\nMkn 501 (Djannati-Atai et al. 1999; Aharonian et al. 2001).\nWhile Fig. 6 is suggestive of such a correlation, the inference is\nF.

In addition, the spectral index\nwas shown to be marginally consistent with being constant.\nTherefore, further observations with the more sensitive com-\nplete H.E.S.S. array are needed to make a definitive statement\nregarding any correlation.\nGiven the large significance observed in each month of data\ntaking, a variability search on a monthly time scale represents\na rather coarse temporal binning of the data. Therefore studies\nwere performed on the data to determine if the VHE flux from\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is also variable on shorter time scales.\n7.2. Nightly time scale\nThe integral flux greater than 300 GeV measured from\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is calculated for each night of observations\nand is shown in Fig. 7. The exposure is different in the vari-\nous nights and the spectral index assumed in the flux calcula-\ntion is the value determined from the power law fit to the time-\naveraged spectra for 2003 (\u0393 = 3.32). This value is used since\nthere is no strong evidence for variability in the spectral index.\nTable 5 lists the results of the fit of the nightly fluxes during\neach month to a constant. The poor \u03c72 values for some of the\ndark periods show that variability in the flux of VHE gamma-\nrays from PKS 2155\u2212304 clearly occurs on time scales of days.\nHowever, the June and September 2003 results also show that\nthere are periods of steady flux as well.\n874 F.

A run\nby run (28 min) time scale is chosen for simplicity and because\neach stereo run should yield on average \u223c4\u03c3 given that \u223c44\u03c3\nwas observed in 55.4 live time hours of stereo observation.\nThe study is not performed for the 2002 data because the mono-\nconfiguration is considerably less sensitive and the data are\nmore sparse (one on-source run on most nights). The respective\nfluxes greater than 300 GeV for each run are fit to a constant\nfor each night of observation, with the hypothesis that any vari-\nability will manifest itself in the form of a poor \u03c72. Only runs\nwith zenith angles of less than 45 degrees are analyzed to elim-\ninate possible systematic effects from large zenith angle ob-\nservations. As motivated in the previous section, the assumed\nspectral index for the flux calculation is \u0393 = 3.32. Since there\nare differing numbers of runs in a given night, the \u03c72 probabil-\nity is calculated from the fit to a constant for each night and is\nshown by the solid line of Fig. 8a for all nights with a minimum\nof one degree of freedom. The dashed line in Fig. 8a represents\nthe nights with more than one degree of freedom. A larger pop-\nulation of nights with low probabilities exists and is evidence\nfor intra-night flux variability.\nFigure 8b shows the flux light curve for the night with the\nlowest probability of being consistent with constant along with\nthe corresponding fit (dashed line). On this night, MJD 52 821,\nflaring behavior is suggested since the flux increases by a fac-\ntor of 2.7 \u00b1 0.7 on the time scale of half an hour, and then de-\ncreases by a factor of 2.3\u00b1 0.9 in a similar time. Unfortunately\nat this stage in the construction of H.E.S.S., observations were\nonly possible with the less sensitive two-telescope software\nstereo configuration, thus a more detailed study is not possi-\nble due to the relatively small number of observed gamma rays\n(\u223c1 per min). However, with the completed H.E.S.S. experi-\nment it will be possible to explore similar phenomena on a time\nscale of a few minutes.\n8. Conclusions\nGamma rays with energies greater than 160 GeV have been\ndetected with high significance (\u223c45\u03c3) from the HBL ob-\nject PKS 2155\u2212304 in H.E.S.S. observations made in 2002\nand 2003. Although observations were made in less sensitive\nconfigurations (fewer telescopes) of H.E.S.S. before the com-\npletion of the construction of the full experiment, a strong\ndetection is found in each of the dark periods of observa-\ntions with appreciable exposure. The VHE flux observed from\nPKS 2155\u2212304 is shown to be variable on the time scale of\nmonths, nights, and hours with an average flux above 300 GeV\nbetween 10% and 60% of that observed from the Crab Nebula.\nAn extreme case of variability shows an increase in the ob-\nserved flux by a factor of 2.7 \u00b1 0.7 in a 30 min interval fol-\nlowed by a decrease by a factor of 2.3 \u00b1 0.9 in the follow-\ning 30 min. Energy spectra are made for each dark period\nfor which a detection occurred and are found to be character-\nized by a steep power law. No evidence is found for variabil-\nity in the spectral index of PKS 2155\u2212304 over time, or for a\nhardening of the spectrum with increased flux levels. However,\nthese hypotheses are also not ruled out. A time-averaged energy\nspectrum is determined for the 2003 H.E.S.S. observations and\nfits to a power law with an exponential cutoff (\u0393 = 2.90+0.21\u22120.23,\nEcut = 1.4+0.8\u22120.7 TeV), and a broken power law (\u03931 = 3.15+0.10\u22120.12,\n\u03932 = 3.79+0.46\u22120.27, Ebreak = 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 TeV), show an improved \u03c72\nper degree of freedom relative to the one obtained from a fit\nF. Aharonian et al.: H.E.S.S. observations of PKS 2155\u2212304 875\nto a simple power-law (\u0393 = 3.32 \u00b1 0.05). Although the fits to\npower laws with features are not significantly better than that\nof a fit to a simple power law, the suggestion of features may\nindicate the absorption of TeV photons on the extragalactic in-\nfrared background light. However, any spectral curvature could\nalso be intrinsic to the blazar.\nComparison of the properties of PKS 2155\u2212304 measured\nby H.E.S.S. to those of other blazars detected at TeV ener-\ngies is somewhat difficult due to the highly variable nature\nof these objects and their differing redshifts. Regardless, com-\nparison of the flux (magnitude and variability) and spectra,\nmay yield some insights into phenomena associated with TeV\nbright AGN. In the cases of the most well studied TeV blazars,\nMkn 421 (z = 0.030) and Mkn 501 (z = 0.033), the ob-\nserved flux has been found to vary from a fraction of the\nCrab flux to peak values of \u223c7 (Aharonian et al. 2002b) and\n\u223c10 (Aharonian et al. 1999a) times the Crab flux respectively.\nThe flux detected from 1ES 1959+650 (z = 0.047) ranges\nfrom 5% to 220% of the Crab (Aharonian et al. 2003b), and\nthe flux measured from 1ES 1426+428 has shown variabil-\nity by a factor of 2.5, with peak fluxes of order 10% of the\nCrab (Aharonian et al. 2003a). Clearly, the flux observed from\nPKS 2155\u2212304, which ranges from 10% to 60% of the Crab,\ndoes not vary as much as that from Mkn 421, Mkn 501 and\n1ES 1959+650. Additionally, the peak fluxes observed from\nthese objects are considerably higher than that measured for\nPKS 2155\u2212304. The observed flux from PKS 2155\u2212304 is\nmost similar, both in magnitude and variability, to that found\nfrom 1ES 1426+428. Comparing the spectra of the other AGN\nto that found from PKS 2155\u2212304 also shows some differ-\nences. The spectral indices, prior to the exponential cutoffs\nfound, of Mkn 501 (\u0393 = 1.92 \u00b1 0.20), Mkn 421 (\u0393 = 2.19 \u00b1\n0.04), and 1ES 1959+650 (\u0393 = 1.83 \u00b1 0.17) are harder than\n\u0393 = 3.32 \u00b1 0.05 found for PKS 2155\u2212304. Again the most\nsimilar blazar is 1ES 1426+428, whose spectral index is \u0393 =\n3.50 \u00b1 0.35 (Petry et al. 2002). It is interesting that the proper-\nties of PKS 2155\u2212304 (z = 0.117) are most like those of 1ES\n1426+428, whose redshift (z = 0.129) is also the most simi-\nlar. However, it cannot be stated from the evidence presented\nthat the similarities are a direct consequence of the comparable\nredshifts.\nAs of 2004, the H.E.S.S. detector is complete and is consid-\nerably more sensitive than any of the configurations presented\nhere, allowing for more detailed studies of PKS 2155\u2212304 and\nother astrophysical objects to be performed in the future.\nAcknowledgements.
