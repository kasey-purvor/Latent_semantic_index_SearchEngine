Introduction\nThe problems of large deviations of nonlinear systems away from an equilibrium state, and\ntransitions to a new state, in response to weak noise, that can be either of internal or of external\norigin, have long attracted the close attention of physicists, in part because these problems are\nassociated with irreversibility of physical processes. In the last few years it has emerged that, in\nsystems far from thermal equilibrium, weak noise can produce qualitative change in the properties\nof a system, e.g., the transformation of an unstable equilibrium state to a stable one and vice versa\n[1], the occurrence of multistability or multimodality [2,3], the appearance of a mean \"eld [4}7],\nthe excitation of noise-induced oscillations [8}11], the occurrence of a peculiar kind of resonance\n(so-called stochastic resonance) [12}19], a possibility of one-directional motion (net current) under\nthe action of zero average forces (so-called stochastic ratchet) [20}22,24,18] and so on. Many such\ne!ects have been demonstrated in analogue electronic experiments } which in turn provided the\nstimulus for further developments in the theory [23]. The aim of this review is to provide an\naccessible introduction to such phenomena. We proceed by reviewing the basis of the theory, and\nthen consider some illustrative examples of current interest. In Section 2, we outline the theory of\n#uctuational transitions and discuss how it can be applied to the problem of intermittency, in\nwhich the dynamical properties of the system change in a seemingly random way between regular\nand chaotic behavior. The theory is applied to the Brownian ratchet problem in Section 3, where\nwe consider the physical basis of noise-induced transport and derive explicit expressions for the\n#ow in several di!erent limits. In particular, we consider di!usion in a saw-tooth potential with an\nadditional regular force, random modulation of the potential barrier height, the e!ect of an\nadditional random force with a large correlation time, the in#uence of the shape of the potential,\nand the e!ect of the mass of the di!using particle. Another phenomenon in which the physical\nbehavior of the system is radically changed by the presence of noise is that of the noise-induced\nphase transition. This is discussed in Section 4 in relation to noise-induced multistability, multi-\nmodality, and noise-induced oscillations. The formalism is applied to several examples of topical\ninterest including a pendulum with a randomly vibrated axis of suspension, a generic oscillator\nwith quadratic nonlinearity (which undergoes a noise-induced phase transition under the action\nof additive noise), a model of childhood epidemics, and the Bonhoe!er}van der Pol oscillator.\nWe draw the ideas together and o!er some conclusions in Section 5. A formal derivation of the\napproximate equation for the one-dimensional probability density is provided in the appendix.\n2. Fluctuational transitions of nonlinear systems from one stable steady state to another\n2.1. Elements of the theory of yuctuational transitions\nThe problem of how transitions occur from one stable state of a system to another under\nin#uence of weak noise can be reduced to the statistical problem of the probability of the \"rst\nattainment of a boundary by a Brownian particle moving in a given force \"eld [25}27]. Several\nexamples of such problems, as applied to systems of di!erent physical origin, were considered, e.g.,\nin [27}39]. The best known of these is [28], in which the problem was solved for a double-well\noscillator in order to estimate the rates of chemical reactions. All of the systems considered in the\n4 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\n1The condition for the smallness of the noise intensity can be written as S(:t`T\nt\nx5 m(t) dt)2T1@2;;\n.!9\n, where \u201e is an\ninterval of time of the order of the mean period of oscillations in the vicinity of the stable steady state of interest.\npapers cited belong to the class of nonlinear oscillators with two or more stable steady states. In the\nabsence of #uctuations, the system, being in one of these states, cannot pass to one of the other\nstates without external action of some kind. In the presence of weak noise, however, the system\nexecutes small random oscillations in the vicinity of one of the steady states and, from time to time,\nundergoes a transition to a di!erent state. If the noise is su$ciently weak, such transitions occur\nonly very rarely. Thus that the system remains in the vicinity of the corresponding stable state over\na long period, and the probability distribution consequently has a chance to reach its stationary\nvalue. First we consider systems for which one can obtain, exactly or approximately, a single\n\"rst-order di!erential equation with a random source describing the behavior of a certain variable\nz characterizing the motion of the system.\nAs an example, let us consider a double-well oscillator with a su$ciently small (in comparison\nwith its natural frequency) damping factor [27]. Its equation of motion can be written as\nxK#cx5 #F(x)\"m(t) , (2.1)\nwhere m(t) is a random process. In the particular case when F(x)\"!ax#bx3, Eq. (2.1) coincides\nwith that considered by Kramers [28]. If the damping factor c and the intensity of the noise m(t) are\nsu$ciently small then the oscillator energy, which is described by\nE\"(x5 2\/2)#;(x) , (2.2)\nwhere ;(x)\":x\n0\nF(x) dx, is a slowly varying function. The stable steady states correspond to\nminima of the function ;(x), and the unstable ones correspond to maxima of this function.\nA transition from one stable steady state to another can occur when;(x) attains its maximal value.\nMultiplying both sides of Eq. (2.1) by x5 we obtain the following exact equation for E:\nEQ \"!cx5 2#x5 m(t) . (2.3)\nSo, combining (2.2) and (2.3) we obtain the two stochastic equations\nx5 \"J2(E!;(x)) ,\nEQ \"!2c(E!;(x))#J2(E!;(x))m(t) .\n(2.4)\nIn the case when the damping constant c, and the intensity and correlation time of the noise, are all\nsu$ciently small1 the two-dimensional Fokker}Planck equation corresponding to the Langevin\nequations (2.4) can [26] be reduced to the one-dimensional equation\nRw(E, t)\nRt \"\nR\nREAAcu(E)J(E)!\ni\n2BwB#\ni\n2\nR2\nRE2 (u(E)J(E)w) , (2.5)\nwhere\nJ(E)\"1\npP\nx.!9\nx.*\/\nJ2(E!;(x)) dx\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 5\n2We assume that i does not depend on E.\n3We assume that the correlation time of the noise is small in comparison with the duration of transient processes in the\nsystem which we denote q\n53\n, i.e., the width of the noise band is much more than 1\/q\n53\n.\nis the action, and\nu(E)\"pAP\nx.!9\nx.*\/\ndx\nJ2(E!;(x))B\n~1\nis the oscillation frequency for a \"xed value of the energy E; x\n.*\/\nand x\n.!9\nare the extreme values\ntaken by x during the oscillations, and they are approximately equal to the roots of the equation\n;(x)\"E; i is the spectral density of the random process m(t) at a certain characteristic oscillation\nfrequency.2 It is evident that the following Langevin equation can be related to the Fokker}Planck\nequation (2.5):\nEQ \"!cu(E)J(E)#i\n2A1!\n1\n2\nd(u(E)J(E))\ndE B#f(E, t) , (2.6)\nwhere f(E, t) is white noise of zero mean and intensity K(E)\"u(E)J(E)i. So, let us consider the\nequation\nz5 \"u(z, m) , (2.7)\nwhere m(t) is su$ciently wide-band3 noise, and the mean value of the right-hand side\nSu(z, m)T,f (z) vanishes at the points z\"z\n0\nand z\"z\n1\nand is negative for z\n0\n(z(z\n1\n. This\nimplies that the point z\n0\nis a stable steady state and that z\n1\nis an unstable steady state.\nAs shown in [26], under the condition of the smallness of the noise correlation time indicated\nabove, u(z, m) can be represented as u(z, m)\"F(z)#f(z, t), where F(z)\"f (z)#K@(z),\nK@(z)\"P\n0\n~=\nAT\nRu(z, m(t))\nRz u(z, m(t#q))U!f (z)\nd f (z)\ndz Bdq ,\nand f(z, t) is zero-mean white noise of intensity\nK(z)\"2P\n0\n~=\n(Su(z, m(t))u(z, m(t#q))T!f 2(z)) dq .\nBecause z can then be considered as a Markov process, we can use the Fokker}Planck equation for\nthe probability density w(z, t):\nRw\nRt\"!\nR\nRz (F(z)w(z, t))#\n1\n2\nR2\nRz2 (K(z)w(z, t)) . (2.8)\nThe stationary solution of Eq. (2.8) satisfying the condition for zero probability #ux is\nw\n45\n(z)\" C\nK(z)\nexp(!t(z)) , (2.9)\n6 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\n4Below we substitute unprimed z in place of primed z@.\nwhere the constant C is determined from the normalization condition, and\nt(z)\"!2P\nz\nz0\n(F(z)\/K(z)) dz . (2.10)\nIt is easy to verify that, for small noise intensity K(z), the function w\n45\n(z) peaks at the points\ncorresponding to stable steady states, in particular, at the point z\n0\n.\nLet us calculate the probability for the passage of the system from a certain point z@ lying in the\nrange from z\n2\nto z\n1\n, where z\n2\n4z\n0\n, through the boundary z\"z\n1\n. Clearly, for su$ciently small\nnoise intensity, the probability of reaching the boundary must be independent of the initial point z@,\nprovided only that this point is not located too close to the boundary. Let us denote a solution of\nEq. (2.8), satisfying the conditions\nw(z, z@, 0)\"d(z!z@), w(z\n1\n, z@, t)\"0 ,\nby w(z, z@, t). Then the probability that z does not attain the boundary z\"z\n1\nin a time t is\nP(t, z@)\"P\nz1\nz2\nw(z, z@, t) dz . (2.11)\nOne method of calculating P(t, z@) was suggested in [27]. The probability density w(z, z@, t) as\na function of z@ is described by the equation conjugate to Eq. (2.8), namely\nRw(z, z@, t)\nRt \"F(z@)\nRw(z, z@, t)\nRz@ #\nK(z@)\n2\nR2w(z, z@, t)\nRz@2 . (2.12)\nIntegrating Eq. (2.12) over z from z\n2\nto z\n1\n, and taking account of (2.11), we obtain an equation for\nthe probability P(t, z@):4\nRP(t, z)\nRt \"F(z)\nRP(t, z)\nRz #\nK(z)\n2\nR2P(t, z)\nRz2 . (2.13)\nLet us represent RP(t, z)\/Rt in terms of the characteristic function\nH(iv, z)\"!P\n=\n0\nRP(t, z)\nRt e*vtdt . (2.14)\nExpanding both sides of expression (2.14) as a power series in iv we obtain\nH(iv, z)\" =+\nk\/0\n(iv)k\nk!\nm\nk\n(z) , (2.15)\nwhere\nm\nk\n(z)\"!P\n=\n0\ntk\nRP(t, z)\nRt dt (2.16)\nis the kth moment of the attainment time. Because P(R, z)\"0 and P(0, z)\"1, then\nm\n0\n(z)\"P(0, z)!P(R, z)\"1. Di!erentiating both sides of Eq. (2.13) with respect to t, multiplying\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 7\nby e*vt and integrating over t from 0 to R, we obtain the following equation for the characteristic\nfunction H(iv, z):\n!ivH\"F(z) RHRz#\nK(z)\n2\nR2H\nRz2 . (2.17)\nSubstituting (2.15) in Eq. (2.17) we can obtain equations for all of the moments of the attainment\ntime. In particular, for the mean \"rst attainment time M(z),m\n1\n(z) we \"nd\nK(z)\n2\nd2M\ndz2\n#F(z) dM\ndz\n#1\"0 . (2.18)\nThis equation, as well as Eq. (2.13), was \"rst derived in [25]. Therefore in the Russian mathematical\nliterature these equations are known as the xrst and the second Pontryagin equations, respectively.\nTo solve Eq. (2.18) we must set two boundary conditions. One of these is immediately evident:\nit is\nM(z\n1\n)\"0 . (2.19)\nThe second boundary condition depends on the character of the boundary z\"z\n2\n[27]. If it is\nperfectly re#ecting, and the requirements that K(z\n2\n)O0, D f (z\n2\n)D(R and z\n2\nO!R are ful\"lled,\nthen dM\/dzD\nz\/z2\n\"0 [27]. If one of these requirements is not ful\"lled, however, then we must use as\nthe second boundary condition the requirement of boundedness of the function M(z) at the point\nz\"z\n2\n. A solution of Eq. (2.18) satisfying the condition (2.19) is [25]\nM(z)\"2P\nz1\nz\nP\nz{\nz2\n1\nK(z)\nexp(!t(z)) exp(t(z@)) dz dz@#CP\nz1\nz\nexp(t(z@)) dz@ , (2.20)\nwhere the constant C is determined from the second boundary condition. In all examples\nconsidered in [29}31,27] the second boundary condition causes C to be equal to zero.\nIn the case of su$ciently weak noise, for C\"0, expression (2.20) can [27] be reduced approxim-\nately to\nM(z)+2P\nz1\nz2\n1\nK(z)\nexp(!t(z)) dzP\nz1\nz2\nexp(t(z)) dz . (2.21)\nIf the conditions\nDz\n1\n!z\n0\nD<J!Q(z\n0\n), Dz\n2\n!z\n0\nD<J!Q(z\n0\n), Dz!z\n1\nD<JQ(z\n1\n) , (2.22)\nwhere\nQ(z)\"1\n2 G\nd\ndzA\nF(z)\nK(z)BH\n~1\n,\nare ful\"lled, the integrals in expression (2.21) can be calculated approximately by using a method\nsimilar to the saddle-point technique. We thus obtain\nM(z)+pJ!Q(z0)Q(z1)\nK(z\n0\n)\nexp(t(z\n1\n)!t(z\n0\n)) . (2.23)\n8 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nWe see from (2.23) that, in the approximation considered, the mean \"rst passage time is indepen-\ndent of z and exponentially dependent of the potential barrier height characterized by the di!erence\nt(z\n1\n)!t(z\n0\n). If the second condition of (2.22) is not ful\"lled, e.g., z\n2\n\"z\n0\n, then an approximate\ncalculation of the integrals in expression (2.21) can be performed in another way. As an example, let\nus consider Eq. (2.6). For this equation expression (2.21) takes the form:\nM(E)+2\niP\nE1\nE0\n1\nu(E)\nexpA!\n2c\ni\nEBdEP\nE1\nE0\n1\nJ(E)\nexpA\n2c\ni\nEBdE . (2.24)\nTaking account of the fact that exp(G2(c\/i)E) have their largest values for E\"E\n0\nand E\"E\n1\n,\nrespectively, and decline rapidly for small i (i;c(E\n1\n!E\n0\n)), in the \"rst integral of (2.24) we can\nsubstitute u(E\n0\n) in place of u(E) and in the second integral we can substitute J(E\n1\n) in place of J(E).\nIn so doing we obtain\nM(E)+ i\n2c2\n1\nu(E\n0\n)J(E\n1\n)\nexpA\n2c\ni\n(E\n1\n!E\n0\n)B , (2.25)\nwhere u(E\n0\n) is the frequency of small oscillations around the stable steady state corresponding to\nE\"E\n0\n. We note that a formula similar to (2.25) was obtained by Kramers [28] and is well known\nas the Kramers formula.\nThe value of M is equal to the mean time at which z \"rst attains the boundary z\"z\n1\n. If the\npotential t(z) at this boundary has a smooth maximum, then the probability of passing through the\nboundary (p) is equal to the probability (1!p) of returning back again, i.e., p\"1\/2. Hence the\nmean time of the passage through the boundary \u201e has to be equal to 2M. As can be shown, if\npO1!p then\n\u201e\"M\/p . (2.26)\nWe now consider another method of calculating the probability P(t, z) and the mean \"rst\nattainment time. It is based on solving the nonstationary Fokker}Planck equation (2.8). For the\nmost part this equation cannot be solved exactly. However, in the case of su$ciently small noise,\nmethods for obtaining approximate solutions of Eq. (2.8) are known. One of them was suggested in\n[27]. Because Eq. (2.8) is linear, its solution, satisfying the boundary condition w(z\n1\n, t)\"0 can be\nrepresented as\nw(z, t)\" =+\nn\/0\ne~jnt w\nn\n(z) , (2.27)\nwhere w\nn\n(z) is nth eigenfunction described by the equation\n1\n2\nd2\ndz2\n(K(z)w\nn\n(z))! d\ndz\n(F(z)w\nn\n(z))#j\nn\nw\nn\n(z)\"0 (2.28)\nwith the boundary condition\nw\nn\n(z\n1\n)\"0 . (2.29)\nIn the case that the noise is weak passages through the boundary are rare and, as a consequence,\nthe least eigenvalue j\n0\nis small, whereas the other eigenvalues are vastly greater. Therefore,\nafter a characteristic time that is short in comparison with 1\/j\n0\nbut long in comparison with\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 9\n1\/j\n1\n, 1\/j\n2\n,2, the main contribution to solution (2.27) will come from the \"rst eigenfunction w0(z)\nassociated with the eigenvalue j\n0\n. So, we can write approximately\nw(z, t)+e~j0tw\n0\n(z) . (2.30)\nThe normalization condition for w\n0\n(z) we set in the form\nP\nz1\nz2\nw\n0\n(z) dz\"1 . (2.31)\nIt follows from (2.11), (2.30), and (2.31) that\nP(t, z)\"e~j0t . (2.32)\nThe fact that P(t, z) does not depend on z is associated with our having used from the outset the\nsmall noise approximation. From (2.16) and (2.32) we obtain that M\"1\/j\n0\n.\nFor calculating j\n0\nwe integrate Eq. (2.28) for n\"0 over z from z\n2\nto z\n1\n. Using the normalization\ncondition (2.31) we \"nd\nj\n0\n\"G(z\n1\n)!G(z\n2\n) , (2.33)\nwhere\nG(z)\"F(z)w\n0\n(z)!1\n2\nd\ndz\n(K(z)w\n0\n(z)) (2.34)\nis the probability #ux. If the boundary z\"z\n2\nis perfectly re#ecting, and the conditions (2.22) are\nful\"lled, then G(z\n2\n)\"0. In the case when z\n2\n\"z\n0\nwe can also put G(z\n2\n)+0 because, in the vicinity\nof z\"z\n0\n, the probability density w\n0\n(z) coincides closely in shape with the stationary distribution\n(2.9) for which G\"0. Taking account of the boundary condition (2.29) we \"nd\nG(z\n1\n)\"!1\n2\nd\ndz\n(K(z)w\n0\n(z))K\nz\/z1\n. (2.35)\nIt follows from (2.33) and (2.35) that, for calculating j\n0\n, a knowledge of the solution of Eq. (2.28) for\nn\"0 in the vicinity of the boundary z\"z\n1\nis su$cient. Because the value of w\n0\n(z) in the vicinity of\nz\"z\n1\nis very small, owing to the boundary condition (2.29), we can neglect the term j\n0\nw\n0\n(z) there.\nMoreover, we can neglect this term for all values of z because, away from the boundary, as\nmentioned above, the probability density w\n0\n(z) has to coincide in shape with the stationary\ndistribution (2.9). Thus, for calculating w\n0\n(z) we can use the stationary Fokker}Planck equation\nwith the boundary condition (2.29) and the normalization condition (2.31).\nThe \"rst integral of the stationary Fokker}Planck equation in view of (2.33) is\nF(z)w\n0\n(z)!1\n2\nd\ndz\n(K(z)w\n0\n(z))\"j\n0\n. (2.36)\nSolving Eq. (2.36) with the boundary condition (2.29) we \"nd\nw\n0\n(z)\" 2j0\nK(z)\nexp(!t(z))P\nz1\nz\nexp(t(z@)) dz@ , (2.37)\n10 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nwhere t(z) is de\"ned by expression (2.10). The value of j\n0\nis found from the normalization\ncondition (2.31):\nj~1\n0\n\"M\"2P\nz1\nz2\n1\nK(z)\nexp(!t(z))GP\nz1\nz\nexp(t(z@)) dz@Hdz . (2.38)\nBy reasoning as above we can remove the term in braces from the \"rst integral by putting z\"z\n2\n.\nIn doing so we obtain an expression coinciding with (2.21). Another approximate method for\nsolving the nonstationary Fokker}Planck equation (2.8) in the case of su$ciently small noise is\nbased on a technique similar to the WKB method. It was applied to the indicated problem in, for\nexample, [40,41]. The results coincide with those set forth above.\nTo conclude this section, let us consider in more detail the question of the most probable\ntrajectory z\n015\n(t) along which a #uctuational transition will occur. In recent years this problem has\nattracted considerable interest from many researchers (see, e.g., [42}48]). Let a system be described\nby the equations\ny5 \"F( y)#n( y, t) , (2.39)\nwhere n( y, t) is white noise of zero mean and intensity K(y), and F(y) vanishes at the points y\"y\n0\nand y\"y\n1\n, i.e., y\n0\nand y\n1\nare singular points. We assume that the point y\n0\nis stable and that the\npoint y\n1\nis unstable. It was shown in [42] that, in the case when K(y) is independent of y, the most\nprobable trajectory y\n015\n(t) can be determined as a partial solution of the auxiliary Hamilton\nequations\ny5 \"RH\/Rp , p5 \"!RH\/Ry , (2.40)\nwhere\nH( y, p)\"pF( y)#( p2\/2)K( y) (2.41)\nis a so-called Wentzel}Freidlin Hamiltonian. The required solution has to satisfy the condition\nH\"0. It is easily shown that Eqs. (2.40) are valid if K(y) depends on y as well. In particular,\nfor a one-dimensional system described by Eq. (2.7) with u(z, m)\"F(z)#f(z, t) Eqs. (2.40)\nbecome\nz5 \"RH\/Rp, p5 \"!RH\/Rz , (2.42)\nwhere\nH(z, p)\"pF(z)#(p2\/2)K(z) . (2.43)\nFrom the condition H\"0 we \"nd p\"2F(z)\/K(z). Substituting this expression into the \"rst\nequation of (2.42) we obtain\nz5 \"!F(z) , (2.44)\ni.e., the most probable trajectory z\n015\n(t) along which the representative point moves away from\na stable singular point z\"z\n0\ncoincides with the incoming trajectory of the corresponding\ndynamical system arriving at this point.\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 11\nA simple explanation of this result for the one-dimensional case can be given as follows. Because\nthe function\n1\nK(z)P\nz1\nz\nexp(t(z@)) dz@\nin expression (2.37) for the eigenfunction w\n0\n(z) varies more slowly than exp(!t(z)), the probability\ndensity w(z, t) is maximal for z(t) satisfying the minimization condition of W(t)\"t(z(t)). This\nquantity can be considered as a classical action characterizing the motion along di!erent trajecto-\nries outgoing, for t\"t\n0\n, from a common point and incoming, for a certain instant t, to di!erent\npoints. As is known from classical mechanics [49], this action is minimal for trajectories obeying\nthe Hamilton equations (2.42), where the Hamiltonian H(z, p, t) is associated with the action W(t) by\nthe Hamilton}Jacobi equation\nRW\/Rt#H(z, p)\"0 . (2.45)\nLet us \"nd the action corresponding to a Hamiltonian of form (2.43). It is known [49] that the\naction S(t) is determined by\nS(t)\"P\nt\nt0\n\u201a dt , (2.46)\nwhere \u201a is the Lagrangian which is associated with the Hamiltonian by the relation\n\u201a\"pz5 !H . (2.47)\nLet us now rewrite expression (2.10) in the form\nt(z(t))\"W(t)\"P\nt\nt0\n\u201aI dt , (2.48)\nwhere \u201aI \"!2z5 F(z)\/K(z). Comparing (2.46) with (2.48) we see that S(t)\"W(t) if \u201a\"\u201aI . It follows\nfrom (2.47) and (2.43) that the latter condition is ful\"lled if H\"0. Hence, for the trajectory z(t)\ndescribed by Eq. (2.44) the quantity W(t) is minimal and therefore the probability density w(z, t) is\nindeed maximal. It should be noted that the optimal trajectories have recently been observed and\nstudied in analogue electronic experiments on nonlinear oscillators [44,46,47,23].\n2.2. Applications of the theory of yuctuational transitions to the problems of intermittency\n2.2.1. Intermittency as a result of a tangent bifurcation\nIt is well known that one possible route for the loss of stability of regular motion and the onset of\nchaos in dynamical systems is the fusion of a stable steady state with an unstable one, with the\nsubsequent disappearance of both of these states. In certain conditions after this bifurcation, which\nis often said to be tangential, the motion of the system exhibits the property of intermittency (see, for\nexample, [50}52]). This property implies that in the system phase space the representative point is\n`walkinga over prolonged periods within a small vicinity of the vanished states. The motion of the\nsystem corresponding to such walking is nearly regular (laminar phases). These long intervals\nof nearly regular motion alternate with short irregular bursts (turbulent phases). Away from the\n12 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nFig. 1. Sketch of a model map close to the transition through intermittency: (a) before the transition; and (b) after the\ntransition.\nbifurcation point the duration of the laminar phases decreases and that of the turbulent ones\nincreases until, \"nally, the laminar phases disappear altogether. The dependence of the mean\nduration of the laminar phases on the excess of the bifurcation parameter beyond its critical value\ncan be evaluated by using a model map (see, for example, [53}55,35,36,52]). If the system is acted\nupon by weak noise then the mean duration of the laminar phases is also dependent on the noise\nintensity. We will concentrate on the results of [35,52], in which the theory of the passage through\na boundary was used.\nLet us consider a system described by a one-dimensional map that can be presented as shown in\nFig. 1 close to the bifurcation point. At the bifurcation point a stable \"xed point of the map, M\n1\n,\nfuses with an unstable one, M\n2\n, and disappears. We set the bifurcation parameter e equal to zero as\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 13\n5The sense of x(1) and x(2) is clear from Fig. 1.\n6The authors of [53] set an unjusti\"ed second boundary condition w(x(1))\"0 and added a constant source in\nEq. (2.52).\nthe map touches the bisectrix. For su$ciently small e, Dx(1)D and Dx(2)D 5 the part of the map labeled\nI can be approximated as\nx\nn`1\n\"e#x\nn\n#axq\nn\n, (2.49)\nwhere q is an even number. It is evident that laminar phases are associated with motion of the\nrepresentative point along part I of the map, whereas turbulent phases are associated with\ntransitions of the representative point to the part labeled II and back again. It has been shown\n[54,55] by using a renormalization T-group technique that the mean duration q of laminar phases\nis proportional to e~(1~1@q). The same result is obtained in [53,35,52] by replacing the di!erence\nequation (2.49) by the corresponding di!erential equation. In [53}55,35,52] the in#uence of\nexternal noise is also considered. It is found that, for e\"0, q&g~2(q~1)@(q`1).\nThe presence of external noise can be described by an additional term in Eq. (2.49), namely\nx\nn`1\n\"e#x\nn\n#axq\nn\n#gm\nn\n, (2.50)\nwhere m\nn\nis white noise with zero mean. We assume that Sm\nn\nm\nm\nT\"d\nnm\n, where d\nnm\nis the Kronecker\ndelta. For su$ciently small e, g and a(x(1),(2))q Eq. (2.50) can be replaced by the following di!erential\nequation [53,35]:\nx5 \"e#axq#gm(t) , (2.51)\nwhere Sm(t)T\"0, Sm(t)m(t@)T\"d(t!t@).

(2.52)\nTo calculate the mean duration of laminar phases it is su$cient to \"nd a steady-state solution of\nEq.

(2.55)\nThe value of the probability #ux G\n0\nis determined from the normalization condition by integrating\n(2.54) and(2.55) with respect to x from !R to x(2). It follows from the general theory of #uctuational\ntransitions set forth above that the mean duration of laminar phases q is equal to G~1\n0\n.

(2.56)\nIn the simplest case when g,0, i.e., in the absence of external noise, it immediately follows from\nEq.

It is known as on}ow intermittency. This\nterm was introduced after the work [56], though a map associated with the similar type of\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 15\nintermittent behavior was \"rst considered by Pikovsky [57] and then by Fujisaka and Yamada\n[58]. An important point is that this type of intermittency can occur not only in coupled dynamical\nsystems but in stochastic systems as well [59]. In [59] the statistical properties of on}o!\nintermittency were studied through analysis of the map\nx\nn`1\n\"a(1#y\nn\n)x\nn\n#f (x\nn\n) , (2.60)\nwhere y\nn\nis either a deterministic chaotic process or a random process, a is the bifurcation\nparameter, and f (x\nn\n) is a nonlinear function free from a linear term. For this map it was shown\nthat for a\u20190 the mean duration of laminar phases is proportional to a~1. The in#uence of\nweak additive noise on the characteristics of on}o! intermittency was considered by Chenis and\nLustfeld [60].\nWe consider on}o! intermittency by reference to a speci\"c example system described by the\nfollowing model equations:\nx5 \"!(b#ar2)x#xAm1(t)#\nm\n2\n(t)\nr B, y5 \"!(b#ar2)y#yAm1(t)#\nm\n2\n(t)\nr B , (2.61)\nwhere r\"Jx2#y2, and m\n1\n(t) and m\n2\n(t) are white noises of intensities i\n1\nand i\n2\n, respectively.\nEqs. (2.61) can be rewritten in polar coordinates r and u\"arctan(y\/x) as\nr5\"!(b#ar2)r#rm\n1\n(t)#m\n2\n(t), u5 \"0 . (2.62)\nWe see that m\n1\n(t) and m\n2\n(t) represent multiplicative and additive noise respectively. The \"rst of\nEqs. (2.62) is of the same form as (2.7). Hence, the Fokker}Planck equation associated with this\nequation can be written as\nRw\nRt\"!\nR\nRr((ba!ar2)rw(r,u, t))#\n1\n2\nR2\nRr2((r2i1#i2)w(r,u, t)) , (2.63)\nwhere a\"i\n1\n\/2b!1 is the bifurcation parameter. To calculate the mean duration of the laminar\nphases, we assume that our system is in a laminar phase if r4e, where e is a given small quantity.\nThe mean duration qe of the laminar phases is determined by the mean duration of a random\nwalk-like motion of a representative point on the phase plane xy inside a circle of radius e. As\nshown above, this duration can be calculated by using the steady-state solution of Eq. (2.63) with\nthe boundary condition\nw(r,u)D\nr\/e\"0 . (2.64)\nThis solution is\nw(r,u)\"2G\ni\n1\nAr2#\nk\n2(a#1)B\n(ak`i1a)@2(a`1)i1~1\nexpA!\nar2\ni\n1\nB\n]P\ne\nr\nAo2#\nk\n2(a#1)B\n~(ak`i1a)@2(a`1)i1\nexpA\nao2\ni\n1\nBdo , (2.65)\nwhere G is the probability #ux across unit of length of any circumference inside the circle of radius\ne, k\"i\n2\n\/b. The value of G is determined from the normalization condition by integrating\n16 P.S. Landa, P.V.E.

(2.66)\nAs already noted, the mean time at which the representative point \"rst attains the circle boundary\nr\"e is determined by total probability #ux across this boundary, i.e., \u201e\"(2peG)~1. Taking\naccount of the fact that the representative point touching the boundary can return again with\nprobability (1!p), we obtain for the mean duration q of the laminar phases the following\nexpression [38,39]:\nq\"\u201ep =+\nj\/1\nj(1!p)j~1 .\nSumming the series we have\nq\"\u201e\/p . (2.67)\nLet us consider the speci\"c case when ae2\/i\n1\n;1. We can then ignore the terms exp(!ar2\/i\n1\n) and\nexp(ao2\/i\n1\n).

(2.68)\nTo calculate the inner integral approximately, we multiply and divide the integrand by o, substitute\ny for o2 and take e\/2 in place of o.

(2.69)\nIn particular, for k\"0 (additive noise is absent) we obtain from (2.69) the following simple formula:\n\u201e\"1\/ba . (2.70)\nSo, for k\"0, we have the same dependence of q on a as for the map (2.60); whereas, for kO0, the\ndependence is more complicated. For kb;e2i\n1\nwe have \u201e\"2(a#1)\/(i\n1\na#ak), i.e., nonlinearity\nplays an important role in this dependence, given that the intermittent behavior begins to show\nitself for a(a\n#3\n\"0.

Noise-induced transport of Brownian particles (stochastic ratchets)\nIn recent years #uctuation-induced transport phenomena for Brownian particles have attracted\nconsiderable interest, usually in the context of biological and chemical problems (see, for example,\n[61}66,20,22,24]). A physical experiment demonstrating the possibility of such transport in\na ratchet-like potential \"eld created by laser beam is described in [67]. In [68] it was experi-\nmentally shown that directed motion of a particle can be induced merely by turning on and o!\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 19\na periodic asymmetric potential (more recently, this phenomenon become known as a yashing\nratchet). Similar experiments are also presented in [69].\nSystems in which noise-induced transport occurs are often called stochastic ratchet-like devices\nby analogy with mechanical device `ratchet and pawla described and considered by Feynman [70].\nFeynman showed that in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium the ratchet on average is at rest\n} it advances and retreats by an equal number of teeth on the wheel } as it must be because of the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics. It is interesting that similar considerations were discussed by\nSmoluchowski [71] well before Feynman. The `ratchet and pawla device constitutes a mechanical\nrecti\"er. It is similar in essence to an electrical recti\"er. However, as is often the case, the problems\nassociated with electrical recti\"cation of #uctuations were discussed independently of the ratchet\nproblems [72}77]. In [73,74] it was found that in the simplest electrical recti\"er, consisting of\ncapacitor and diode, the capacitor can be charged without an external source, at the expense of\nonly thermal #uctuations. This paradoxical result cast some doubt on the applicability of the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics to the phenomenon considered [76]. As far back as 1950,\nhowever, considering the diode as a nonlinear resistor, Brillouin [72] showed that, for the Second\nLaw to apply, a shift of the characteristic of the nonlinear resistor must be taken into account.\nStratonovich [77,78] established, on a certain model of diode, that such a shift does indeed occur\ndue to #uctuations of the current through the diode considered as a nonlinear resistor, and he\ncalculated it. With this shift, the mean value of the voltage drop across the capacitor is found to\nvanish for the case of thermodynamical equilibrium.\nMost commonly, consideration of noise-induced transport is restricted to the so-called overdam-\nped case, when the mass of the Brownian particle can be neglected and its motion is described by\na \"rst order di!erential equation of the form\nx5 #f (x)\"u(t)#f(x, t)#m(t) , (3.1)\nwhere f (x) is a periodic function of x possessing an asymmetry, u(t) is a regular periodic force, f(x, t)\nis a random process with zero mean value, and m(t) is white noise of intensity K imitating thermal\n#uctuations. The process f(x, t) can be either given or described by additional equations.\nMore often than not researchers of noise-induced transport set the function f (x) to a form\ncorresponding to a saw-tooth potential ;(x)\":x\n0\nf (x) dx shown in Fig. 4. In this case\nf (x)\"G\na\n1\nfor n\u201a(x(n\u201a#x\n1\n,\n!a\n2\nfor n\u201a!x\n2\n(x(n\u201a ,\n(3.2)\nwhere n\"0,$1,$2,2,\u201a\"x1#x2 is the period of the function f (x). It is easily shown that, in\nthe absence of the disturbances f(x, t) and m(t), the points x\"n\u201a and x\"n\u201a#x\n1\n\"(n#1)\u201a!x\n2\ncorrespond to stable and unstable equilibrium states, respectively. If there are #uctuations then\ntransitions from one stable state to another can occur. Directional motion of the particle will occur\nif the probabilities of transitions in opposite directions are di!erent. So, we see that the problem of\nnoise-induced transport is closely allied to the #uctuational transitions considered above.\nIt is usual to distinguish two types of ratchet devices [64,79,65,20,80]: (a) where f(x, t) is a force\nindependent of x; and (b) where f(x, t) depends on x. In its turn, the latter can be also divided into\ntwo subclasses: (i) those where f(x, t)\"f (x)s(t), which is to say that the height of the potential\nbarrier #uctuates [64]; and (ii) where f(x, t) is a random function of t and x [80].\n20 P.S.

An example of a saw-tooth potential ;(x).\nIn the last few years much attention has been concentrated on the possibility of exploiting such\nphenomena to separate particles of di!erent mass or size. In this connection studies of di!erent\nmodels giving #ux reversals as the system parameters change are very important [81}83,85,86].\nFlux reversals induced by noise colour alone, predicted in [82], were subsequently observed in\nanalogue electronic experiments [84].\nWe consider below the one-dimensional motion of a Brownian particle in a viscous medium\ndescribed by the following equation:\nkxK#x5 #f (x)\"u(t)#f(x, t)#m(t) , (3.3)\nwhere k\"m\/b, m is the particle mass, b is the viscous friction factor, f (x) is described by expression\n(3.2), and u(t), f(x, t) and m(t) are the same that in Eq.

Although this procedure is simple in principle,\nit leads to rather cumbersome expressions. Therefore we restrict ourselves to the analysis of the\nzeroth-order approximation. If condition (3.14) is ful\"lled and u(t),B\n0\n\"const (in addition to\nf (x) a constant force acts upon the particle), then\nSx5 T+ ;20\nK2 sinh2(;\n0\n\/K)\nB\n0\n, (3.28)\ni.e., the particle moves in the direction of this constant force no matter what the relation between\na\n1\nand a\n2\n. We see from (3.28) that in the absence of #uctuations, when KP0, Sx5 TP0, i.e.,\ntransport of the particle is impossible despite the presence of the constant force. This is because the\nforce is small and cannot by itself push the particle over the potential barrier. In another speci\"c\ncase, when u(t)\"B cosut, where B is su$ciently small, we obtain\nSx5 T+ ;20(a2!a1)B2\n2K2a\n1\na\n2\nsinh2(;\n0\n\/K)A\n;2\n0\nK2 sinh2(;\n0\n\/K)\n# ;0\nK tanh(;\n0\n\/K)\n!2B , (3.29)\ni.e., the particle moves in the direction of the slower rate of potential change. It is easy to verify that,\nin the absence of #uctuations, transport of the particle cannot occur, just as in the case of a small\nconstant force.\nExamples of the dependences of Sx5 T\/B2 on K\/;\n0\ndescribed by formulas (3.7), (3.13) are shown in\nFig. 5 for a number of values of B. We see that these dependences are of radically di!erent kinds for\nB(min(a\n1\n, a\n2\n) and B\u2019min(a\n1\n, a\n2\n). In the \"rst case these dependences have a maximum at\na certain value of K\/;\n0\nthat is the smaller the greater is B. For K\/;\n0\nP0, i.e., in the absence of the\nthermal #uctuations, Sx5 T\/B2P0. In the second case Sx5 T\/B2 tends to a certain \"nite value as\nK\/;\n0\nP0, which can be calculated from the theory of vibrational transport [87,86]. For B(0.5\nthe dependences found are almost coincident with those described by the approximate formula (3.29).\nIn this case the averaged particle velocity is maximal for K\/;\n0\n+0.43. In the case that B(min (a\n1\n, a\n2\n),\nthe ratio K\/;\n0\nis either very small or very large, noise-induced transport is not feasible.\nThe results obtained can be explained in the following manner. Noise-induced transport can\noccur if #uctuational transitions through each potential barrier are more frequent in one direction\nthan in another. Because the probability of the transition through a certain potential barrier\ndepends only on its height and the intensity of #uctuations, transport is impossible in the absence of\nthe additional force u(t). In the case of a constant force the result is self-evident because the heights\nof the potential barriers for the particle moving rightwards and leftwards are di!erent. The case of\nan alternating force is more complicated. During one half-period the right potential barrier\nis lowered to ;\n0\n!Bx\n1\n, whereas the left one rises to ;\n0\n#Bx\n2\n. During the next half-period the\nright potential barrier rises to ;\n0\n#Bx\n1\n, whereas the left one is lowered to ;\n0\n!Bx\n2\n. Because\nthe lowering of the potential barrier plays a dominant role, the particle moves, in average, in the\ndirection of larger lowering of the potential barrier.\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E.

However,\nconcrete results were obtained only for dichotomous and `kangarooa-like processes.

In the second approximation only one #ux reversal retains, for\nK\/;\n0\n\u20193. It follows from here that for the veri\"cation of the results obtained a consideration of\nhigher approximations is necessary.\nIt is evident that the dependence of the mean velocity of a particle on its mass can be used for the\nseparation of particles of di!erent masses. Examples of the dependencies of Sx5 T\/B2 on k for\ndi!erent values of K\/;\n0\ncalculated in the \"rst, second and third approximations are illustrated\nin Fig. 11.

Noise-induced phase transitions in nonlinear oscillators\nIn recent years the problem of nonequilibrium noise-induced phase transitions has attracted\nconsiderable attention from many scientists. These transitions are characterized by a qualitative\nchange of the state of a system as the intensity of noise acting upon it increases. This change can\nmanifest itself in the appearance of new extrema in the probability distribution for the system\nvariables or disappearance of old ones [2,89], in either stabilization or destabilization of system\nequilibrium states [1,9], in the occurrence of so-called mean \"eld [4}7], in the excitation of\noscillations [1,8,9,11,10], in the appearance of supernarrow spectral peaks close to the transition\n[90,91], and other marked changes in behaviour.\n4.1. Noise-induced multistability and multimodality\nHorsthemke and Lefever discuss [2] many examples where additional peaks appear in the\nprobability density under in#uence of multiplicative noise. This phenomenon is treated as\na nonequilibrium noise-induced phase transition (NIPT). In so doing it is correctly reasoned that the\nappearance of a peak in the probability density signals the appearance of a new stable steady state,\ni.e., the occurrence of multistability or multimodality. NIPTs of this type were \"rst demonstrated\nconvincingly in the genetic model equation [3] and subsequently in a cubic bistable system [92].\nWe consider here one example of noise-induced multistability: the pendulum with a randomly\nvibrated axis of suspension, for which the unstable upper equilibrium position can be transformed\nby noise to a stable one. It is well known that, where the suspension is vibrated harmonically, the\nupper equilibrium position can become stable if the frequency of the vibration is su$ciently high\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E.

This phenomenon was observed experimentally by Kapitsa [93,94].\nMore recently, it was shown [8,9] that a similar phenomenon can be also occur in the case of\nrandom, but su$ciently high-frequency, vibration of the suspension axis.\nThe equation describing the oscillations of a pendulum with randomly vibrated suspension axis\nand additive noise can be written as\nuK #2bu5 #(1#u2f(t))sinu\"m(t) , (4.1)\n38 P.S.

First we put m(t),0 and show directly that the\npendulum upper equilibrium state becomes stable if p2 is su$ciently large. If the power spectrum of\nthe random process f(t) does not contain components in zones of parametric resonance, #uctu-\nations of the variable u caused by the random vibration of the suspension axis are small.

(4.4) and (4.5), having the form\nSuT\"p, du\"0 , (4.6)\ncorresponds to the upper equilibrium position of the pendulum, in whose stability we are\ninterested. To investigate this stability, we can linearize Eqs. (4.4) and (4.5) with respect to small\ndeviations from the solution (4.6) t\"SuT!p and du. The linearized equations are\nt$ #2btQ !t!u2Sf(t)duT\"0 , (4.7)\nduK #2b du5 !du!u2f(t)t\"0 . (4.8)\nA steady-state solution of Eq.

(4.10)\nPutting in this expression t@!t\"q and taking into account that the value t does not vary\nsigni\"cantly during the correlation time of the random process f(t), we rewrite (4.10) in the\nfollowing form:\nSf(t)duT\"! u2\n2J1#b2\nt(t)P\n=\n0\n(e~p1q!e~p2q)Sf(t)f(t#q)Tdq .

It follows from (4.14) that the mean deviation of the pendulum from its\nupper equilibrium position will decay, i.e., the equilibrium position will be stable, if the frequency\nX\n0\nis real. This condition is valid if\nu2p251 . (4.15)\nLet us show further that at condition (4.15) an additional maximum and minimum appear in the\nprobability distribution. It follows from Eq. (4.1) that there is no stationary probability distribution\nfor the original variables u and u5 . Therefore we use the `slowa variable \/\"SuT and the `fasta\nvariable du, which are described by Eq. (4.5), and include the additive noise m(t).

Substituting u(t)\"\/(t)#du(t), in view of (4.17), into\nEq.

The reason is that authors, using\nthe variable u\"lnA in place of A, implicitly ignored correlation between the noise m(t) and the\namplitude A.

Thus, the condition g\"0 gives the onset of the phase transition. It\nfollows that, in the absence of additive noise, the critical value of the multiplicative noise intensity is\ni#3m (2u0),i#3\"16b\/3u20 . (4.43)\nThe parameter g characterizes the extent to which the intensity of multiplicative noise component\nexceeds its critical value.\nIt should be noted that, for g\u20190, the steady state A\"0 loses its stability and the state AO0\nbecomes stable. At the same time, (4.40) implies that the probability density of A2 is monotonically\ndecreasing with increasing A2 for any values of g\u20190 (see Fig. 13). The same result has also been\nobtained by numerical simulation. Hence, the appearance of a new stable state need not be\naccompanied by the appearance of a new maximum in the probability distribution.\nIn the case when the intensity of additive noise is nonzero, the steady-state solution of Eq.

Phase transition in an oscillator with quadratic nonlinearity induced by additive noise\nWe now show that in an oscillator with a quadratic nonlinearity in the restoring force, additive\nnoise can result in a nonequilibrium phase transition similar to that considered above. The physical\nmechanism of such the transition is subharmonic resonance [1].\nLet us consider a nonlinear oscillator described by the following equation:\nxK#2bx5 #u2\n0\n(1#bx#cb2x2)x\"u2\n0\nm(t) , (4.56)\nwhere b is the friction factor, m(t) is a su$ciently wide-band random process with zero mean value,\nb is the quadratic nonlinearity parameter, and the term cb2x3 is introduced to prevent the solution\ndiverging to in\"nity.8 Substituting x@\"bx into Eq. (4.56) and dropping primes we obtain\nxK#2bx5 #u2\n0\n(1#x#cx2)x\"u2\n0\nbm(t) . (4.57)\nSo, variation of the nonlinearity parameter b is evidently equivalent to variation of the noise\nintensity.\nBecause the noise intensity which is necessary to induce the phase transition in question is not\nsmall, we cannot use the Krylov}Bogolyubov method for Eq. (4.57) directly. To use this method,\nwe have to introduce new variables (just as for calculating subharmonic resonances [1]). So, we\nsubstitute into Eq. (4.57)\nx(t)\"y(t)#s(t) , (4.58)\nwhere s(t) is a random process satisfying the equation\nsK#2bs5 #u2\n0\ns\"u2\n0\nbm(t) . (4.59)\nIn this way we can \"nd the equation for the variable y(t). It can conveniently be written as\nyK#2by5 #u2\n0\n(1#y#2s#c(3s2#y2#3ys))y\"m\n1\n(t) , (4.60)\nwhere m\n1\n(t)\"!u2\n0\ns2(t)(1#cs(t)) is additive noise. The terms 2sy and 3cs2y are responsible for\nthe phase transition, whereas the terms cy3 and csy2 are responsible for limiting the oscillation\namplitude.\nAn approximate analytic solution of Eq. (4.60), consistent with Eq. (4.59), is possible in the\nspeci\"c case when the spectral density of the random process m(t) at the main frequency u\n0\nis\nnegligibly small, whereas it is su$ciently large at the frequency 2u\n0\n. The random force in Eq. (4.59)\nis then nonresonant. Consequently, s(t) is su$ciently small that we can ignore in Eq. (4.60) the two\nterms m\n1\n(t) and 3cs2y. As a result we obtain the following approximate equation for y:\nyK#2by5 #u2\n0\n(1#y#2s#cy2)y\"!3u2\n0\ncy2s . (4.61)\n50 P.S. Landa, P.V.E.

From the normalization\ncondition we \"nd\nC\"2G\na\n1\n#rg\na\n1\nr3g@2(1`g)\nC(3(a\n1\n#rg)\/2r(1#g))\nC(3g\/2(1#g))C(3a\n1\n\/2r(1#g)) for g50 ,\n0 for g40 .\n(4.70)\nIt then follows that the probability density of the amplitude is d-function for g40, as for the\npendulum considered above. Using (4.69) and (4.70) we \"nd SA2T:\nSA2T\" 3g\n3a\n1\n#r(2#5g)\"\ng\na!r . (4.71)\nWe see that for rP0 expression (4.71) transforms to (4.42). If rO0, the slope of the dependence\nSA2T(g) increases with increasing r. It is evident that the solution found is valid only for r(a.\nThe results of numerical simulation of exact equations (4.59) and (4.60) in the case of su$ciently\nwide-band noise are shown in Fig. 16. For comparison, the results of numerical simulation of\nEqs. (4.59) and (4.60) with m\n1\n(t),0 are given in the same \"gure.9 We see that in the \"rst case the\nphase transition is extremely noisy. In the second case the phase transition is clearly de\"ned: close\nto the critical point, the dependence of the variance of the variable y\n3\n(which can be treated as an\norder parameter) on the parameter b2 (which can be treated as temperature) can be approximated\nby the straight line described by the equation p2\ny3\n\"0.056(b2!b2\n#3\n), where b\n#3\n+4.1, i.e., the critical\nindex is equal to 1 (see Fig. 16(a)).\nFig. 16(b) demonstrates that we can use as an order parameter not only the variance, but the\nmean value of the variable y as well. Close to the critical point, the dependence of Sy\n3\nT on b2 can be\napproximated by the straight line Sy\n3\nT\"!0.025(b2!b2\n#3\n).\nIt should be noted that the phase transition would occur for a smaller value of b2 if the term\n3cs2y in the reduced equation were ignored. Hence this term has the e!ect of suppressing the phase\ntransition. This is also attested to by the fact that the slope of the dependence of p2\ny3\non b2 decreases\nwith increasing b2 rather than increases.\nTo reduce the noise spectral density at the frequency u\n0\n, we have passed our noise m(t) through\na bandpass \"lter with a central frequency of 2u\n0\nand a bandwidth of u\n0\n. The spectral density of this\nnoise is shown in Fig. 17. We see that it is indeed very small at the frequencies u\n0\nand 3u\n0\n. Next we\nsimulate Eqs. (4.59) and (4.60) using the \"ltered noise as m(t). For comparison we simultaneously\nsimulate Eq. (4.60) with m\n1\n(t),0. The results are shown in Fig. 18. We see that, even though the\nspectral density of the \"ltered noise m(t) at the frequency u\n0\nis very small, the in#uence of the noise\nm\n1\n(t) and of the term 3cs2y is considerable. The reason is that the component of the noise s(t) at\nthe frequency u\n0\ndoes not appear to be small, because it is resonant. Nevertheless, it can be seen\nthat in this case the phase transition occurs for a somewhat smaller value of b2 and the slope of the\ndependence of p2\n3\non b2 in the vicinity of the transition is greater than in the case of wide-band\nnoise.\n52 P.S.

The relative number of children S susceptible to\ninfection increases with total number of children but decreases because a section of the group\nremains unexposed and because a section of them falls into the category of the exposed but not yet\ninfective (E). Some of the children exposed remains noninfective, whereas others fall in the category\nof the infective (I). In its turn, a group of the infective children do not fall sick and another part,\nhaving had the disease, recover and falling in the forth category (R). Taking account of the fact that\nthe total number of children is constant, the model equations can be written as\nSQ \"m(1!S)!bSI, EQ \"bSI!(m#a)E, IQ\"aE!(m#g)I , (4.72)\nRQ \"gI!mR , (4.73)\nwhere 1\/m is the average expectancy time, 1\/a is the average latency period, 1\/g is the average\ninfection period, b is the contact rate (the average number of susceptibles contacted infection\nannually). Note that Eqs. (4.72) do not contain the variable R; hence these equations can be\nconsidered independently of Eq. (4.73).\n54 P.S. Landa, P.V.E.

Later these equations were studied in detail by Olsen and Scha!er [101] and\nEngbert [102]. It was shown that periodic variation of the contact rate can result not only in\nperiodic oscillations of childhood infections but in chaotic behavior as well.\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E.

(4.72) have,\ndepending on the parameters, either one (for ab\n0\n4(m#a)(m#g)) or two (for ab\n0\n\u2019\n(m#a)(m#g)) singular points: one of them has the coordinates S\"1, E\"I\"0 and another\n(if it exists) has the coordinates\nS\n0\n\"(m#a)(m#g)\nab\n0\n, E\n0\n\" m\nm#a!\nm(m#g)\nab\n0\n, I\n0\n\" am\n(m#a)(m#g)!\nm\nb\n0\n. (4.74)\nIn the case that there is only one singular point it is stable, whereas in the case that both of the\nsingular points exist the \"rst of them is aperiodically unstable and the second is stable. These cases\nare said to correspond to extinction of epidemics and endemic equilibrium, respectively.\nIt is shown in [101] that the values of the model parameters most closely corresponding to the\nestimates made for childhood diseases in \"rst world countries are m\"0.02 yr~1, a\"35.84 yr~1,\ng\"100 yr~1, b\n0\n\"1800 yr~1. For these parameters Eqs. (4.72) have two singular points. In our\nstudies we have used these same parameter values.\nIf the parameter b oscillates then the variables S, E and I oscillate too, and these oscillations\noccur about the stable singular point with coordinates (4.74). Therefore, it is convenient to\nsubstitute into Eqs. (4.72) the new variables x\"S\/S\n0\n!1, y\"E\/E\n0\n!1, and z\"I\/I\n0\n!1. Putting\nb\"b\n0\n(1#b\n1\nf (t)), where f (t) is a function describing the shape of the contact rate oscillation, let us\nrewrite Eqs. (4.72) in the variables x, y, z:\nx5 #mx\"!b\n0\nI\n0\n((1#b\n1\nf (t))(x#z#xz)#b\n1\nf (t)) ,\ny5 #(m#a)y\"(m#a)((1#b\n1\nf (t))(x#z#xz)#b\n1\nf (t)) ,\nz5 #(m#g)z\"(m#g)y .\n(4.75)\nIn Eqs. (4.75) the term b\n1\nf (t) can be considered as an external action upon the system. We see from\n(4.75) that this action is not only multiplicative, i.e., parametric, but additive, i.e., forcing, as well. It\nshould be noted that, owing to the quadratic nonlinearity, the forcing action can cause a strong\nresponse of the system even in the absence of resonance.\nFor b\n1\n\"0 and small initial deviations from the steady state x\"0, y\"0, z\"0 the system\nexecutes damped oscillations which are close to harmonic in shape (Fig. 20(a)).

The time-evolution of the variable z is similar to that of y.\ndeviate further and further from harmonicity, as exempli\"ed by Fig. 20(b). The frequency of natural\noscillations decreases with their increasing amplitude.\nAs mentioned above, in [100,101] it was assumed that, owing to seasonal variations of\nenvironmental conditions, the contact rate b depends periodically on time with a period equal to\none year, viz., f (t)\"cosut, where u\"2p. We emphasize that the frequency of the contact rate\nvariation is about twice the natural frequency of small free oscillations of the model variables u\n0\n.\nIt was shown that the periodic variation of the parameter b causes the appearance either periodic\nor chaotic oscillations of the variables S, E, and I. For very small b\n1\nthe oscillations excited are\nclose to harmonic at the frequency of the action u. For a certain value of b\n1\na period-doubling\nbifurcation occurs that is associated with the parametric mechanism of the oscillation excitation.\nAs b\n1\nincreases the main frequency of the oscillations remains equal to u\/2 and the shape of the\noscillations of the variable x approaches a saw-tooth. On further increasing b\n1\nanother period-\ndoubling bifurcation takes place, and then a drastic transition to chaos, accompanied by a dra-\nmatic increase in the oscillation variance, occurs. We note that chaotic oscillations for b\n1\n\"0.28\nwere \"rst found numerically by Olsen and Scha!er [101]. For this value of b\n1\nthe time dependences\nof x and y, and the projection of the phase trajectory on the x, y-plane found by numerical\nsimulation of Eqs. (4.75) are shown in Fig. 21(a).\nFrom a physical standpoint, an assumption of random variation of the contact rate seems more\njusti\"ed than a periodic variation. It is evident that b(t) has to be a su$ciently wide-band random\nprocess for which the spectral density peaks at the frequency corresponding to one reciprocal year.\nStarting from this assumption we have simulated numerically Eqs. (4.75) with f (t)\"s(t), where s(t)\nis a random process which is a solution of the equation\nsK#2ps5 #6p2s\"km(t) , (4.76)\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E.

It is seen from this \"gure that the\nnoise-induced oscillations di!er very slightly in their form from those for the case of a harmonic\nvariation of the contact rate. This is associated with the fact that the variation of the contact rate\nonly induces the phase transition, whereas the shape of the induced oscillations is mainly\ndetermined by intrinsic properties of the system, manifesting themselves in the shape of free\noscillations as well.\nThe evolution of the oscillation power spectra in the case of a periodic variation of the contact\nrate is illustrated in Fig. 23. We see that, for b\n1\n\"0.03, the spectral density does peak at the\nfrequency u whereas, for b\n1\n\"0.1, it peaks at the frequency u\/2. For b\n1\n\"0.26 the power spectrum\n58 P.S. Landa, P.V.E.

This is supported by the\ndependence of the variance of the variable x, which we denote by p2, on the parameter b\n1\n(Fig. 24(a)). We see that for b\n1\n+0.066 the rate of change of the variance increases markedly.\nClose to this point the dependence of p2 on b\n1\ncan be approximated by the formula\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E.

So, the critical index is equal to 1\/2. Such a dependence is typical of\nsecond-order phase transitions: one can consider p2 as an analog of the order parameter and b\n1\nas\nan analog of the temperature. For b\n1\n+0.27 another transition, revealing itself in going from\nperiodic oscillations to chaotic ones and in a jump-like increase of the variance, occurs (see\nFig. 24(b)). This transition can be considered as an induced \"rst-order phase transition.\nThe evolution of the oscillation power spectra in the case of random variation of the contact rate\nis given in Fig. 25. In contrast to what happens when the variation of the contact rate is periodic,\n60 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nFig. 24.

The solid line\nrepresents p2\"0.47(b\n1\n!0.066).\nFirst we consider the case when the additive action is absent, i.e., b\n2\n\"0, b\n1\nO0. In this case the\ndependence of p2 on b\n1\nfor periodic variation of the contact rate is shown in Fig. 27(a). It is evident\nfrom this \"gure that oscillations are excited only when a critical value of the parameter b\n1\nis\nexceeded. This is the characteristic property of parametrically excited oscillations (see, for example,\n[1]). With increasing di!erence between b\n1\nand its critical value b(#3)\n1\n+0.032 the variance increases\nnearly linearly. So, the critical index for this case is equal 1. For b\n1\n\u20190.075 the solution becomes\nunstable and goes to in\"nity.\nIf there is only additive action, i.e., b\n1\n\"0, b\n2\nO0, oscillations are excited even for values of b\n2\nas\nsmall as is wished. However, for b\n2\n(b(#3)\n2\n, where b(#3)\n2\n+0.0885, the amplitude of these oscillations\nis very small and their frequency is equal to u. For b\n2\n+b(#3)\n2\nthe rate of change of the variance\nincreases rapidly and for b\n2\n\u2019b(#3)\n2\nthe dependence of p2 on b\n2\ncan be approximated by the straight\nline p2\"0.14(b\n2\n!b(#3)\n2\n) (see Fig. 27(b)). The drastic increase in the rate of change of the variance is\nassociated with the onset of subharmonic resonance. Indeed, the main frequency of the oscillations\nexcited, for b\n2\n\u2019b(#3)\n2\n, becomes equal to u\/2. Considering this process as a second-order phase\ntransition, we can conclude that, as with purely parametric action, in the case of purely additive\naction the critical index is also equal to 1. For b\n2\n\u20190.15 the solution, as in the case of parametrical\nexcitation, becomes unstable and goes to in\"nity. The computation of Eqs. (4.77) with b\n1\nO0\nand b\n2\nO0 shows that parametric and additive actions a!ect the behavior in opposite directions,\nresulting in the stabilization of the solution for moderately large amplitudes.

The critical value of the parameter b\n1\nis approximately\nequal to 0.095, i.e., signi\"cantly larger than in the case of harmonic variation of the contact rate.

They are a generalization of the\nvan der Pol equations for relaxation oscillations [108], and describe oscillations of the voltage\nacross a neural membrane x allowing for the refractoriness characterized by the variable y.\nSubsequently, similar equations, but incorporating spatial di!usion, came to be known as the\nFitz Hugh}Nagumo equations [109}111].

It follows from\nthe results of numerical simulation of Eq. (4.80) that the variance of the variables m and g increases\nalmost discontinuously in this process. An example of the dependence of the variance of the\nvariable m on A for u\"0.3 is given in Fig. 30(a). The excitation of such oscillations, accompanied\nby a drastic increase in the oscillation variance, can be considered as a \"rst-order phase transition.\nIt is interesting that the jump exhibits \"ne structure: there are local ups and downs in the variance\ngrowth (see Fig. 30(b) and (c)). This \"ne structure is associated with drastic changes in the\noscillations' shape under small changes of A (see Fig. 31).\nThe critical value of A depends on the frequency u: it is minimal for a certain value of the\nfrequency which in turn depends on I\n0\n. The reason of this dependence lies in the resonant response\nof the nonlinear oscillator to a harmonic external force. As an example, the dependence of the\ncritical value of the amplitude A on the frequency u is shown in Fig. 32 for I\n0\n\"0.2. We see that the\ncritical value of the amplitude is minimal for u\"0.27, which is close to the frequency u\n0\n+0.3146\nof small free oscillations about the equilibrium state.\nIf the alternating component of the current across the membrane F(t) is a random process, for\nexample white noise, then the transition to a new state occurs too, but is of radically di!erent\ncharacter. The appearance of a `limit cyclea induced by white noise was considered in\n[115,119,97]. However, these works are mainly devoted to the calculation of the probability\ndistributions in the vicinity of the induced `limit cyclea. We consider this phenomenon in terms of\nhow it exhibits the intrinsic properties of the system and from the standpoint of a noise-induced\n68 P.S. Landa, P.V.E.

The latter is associated with the crossing of a boundary on the phase plane\n(the transient repeller is such a boundary) by the representative point under action of noise. In\nprinciple, such an intersection is possible for an arbitrarily small noise intensity i. Therefore the\ntransition occurs smoothly from i\"0 onward and hence, in a strict sense this process is not\na phase transition. Nonetheless, it is closely similar to a second-order noise-induced phase\ntransition. For example, the dependence of the variance of the variable m on the noise intensity i,\nP.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80 69\nFig. 32. The dependence of the critical amplitude value A\n#3\non the frequency u for I\n0\n\"0.2.\nfound by numerical simulation of Eqs. (4.80) and shown in Fig. 33, can be approximated on\na certain interval by p2m+5(i!i#3)1@2, where i#3+0.0065. This formula is similar to that\ndescribing the dependence of an order parameter on temperature for conventional second-order\nphase transitions, with a critical index equal to 1\/2. Furthermore, it can be seen (see, e.g., Fig. 34)\nthat this transition occurs via a peculiar kind of on}o! intermittency. Just as for ordinary on}o!\nintermittency [56,59,38,39], close to the onset of the transition the representative point on the\nphase plane is moving within a certain e-vicinity of the equilibrium state over prolonged periods\n(so called `laminar phasesa), and only occasionally escapes from this vicinity. Unlike ordinary\non}o! intermittency, however, these escapes have not random but strictly speci\"ed shape of pulses,\nand their durations are unchanged as the noise intensity increases. That is why these escapes should\nnot be called `turbulent phasesa. Away from onset, the duration of the laminar phases decreases\nand the variance of the system variables increases. Because the duration of the pulses is unchanged,\nwe can use the mean interpulse time (the mean period) in place of the mean duration of the laminar\nphases. The dependence of the mean period \u201e on the noise intensity i is shown in Fig. 35. It can be\napproximated by the formula\n\u201e+38 exp(0.02\/i) ,\nwhich is typical for the mean time for reaching a boundary (see Section 1). We see that the mean\nperiod decreases exponentially as the noise intensity increases. This result coincides qualitatively\nwith the initial part of the corresponding dependence obtained in [115,119]. However, we have not\nfound an increase of the mean period with increasing the noise intensity as reported in [115,119].\n70 P.S. Landa, P.V.E. McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nFig. 33.

McClintock \/ Physics Reports 323 (2000) 1}80\nIt is very important that the pulses induced by noise di!er little in their shape from the pulses\ninduced by periodic force (compare Figs. 36 and 31(g)). In the \"rst case only the pulses are\nsomewhat noisy and the interpulse time is random. Thus do the intrinsic properties of the system\nreveal themselves.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have demonstrated that weak noise acting upon a nonlinear dynamical system can have\nfar-reaching consequences, such as a transition to a new state, the transformation of an unstable\nequilibrium state into a stable one, and vice versa, the occurrence of multistability and multimodal-\nity, noise-induced transport (stochastic ratchets), and the excitation of noise-induced oscillations.\nMany of these phenomena can be treated as nonequilibrium phase transitions induced by noise.\nThe origins of these transitions lie in intersection of a certain boundary in the system phase space\nby the representative point under the action of noise.\nAppendix A.
