By the end of 1998, seven years after planting, \nthe height of the poplar hybrid Beaupr\u00e9 (11.9 m) was greater than those of the hybrids \nGibecq, Robusta and Trichobel (8.9-9.8 m).  The trees at the most exposed site had the \nshortest height (9.2 m) and the greatest diameter at breast height (173 mm).  Tree \ngrowth was also affected by the arable treatments.  The height (9.5 m) and diameter \n(143 mm) of the trees bordered on both sides by a continuous rotation of arable crops \nwere 89% and 79%, respectively, of those bordered on both sides by a regularly \ncultivated fallow.  This result could be explained by competition for water.  Across the \nthree sites, in the presence of the trees the yield per unit cropped area, relative to that in \nthe control areas, was an average of 4% less in the first three years and an average of \n10% less between years four and six.  However the specific responses were dependent \non the arable crop.  The experiment also included an alternately-cropped arable \ntreatment, where the crop was alternated with a one-year bare fallow.  The benefits of a \npreceding fallow, rather than a cereal crop, for yield were greatest for wheat (Triticum \naestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and least for field beans (Vicia faba L.), \npeas (Pisum sativum L.) and mustard (Brassica alba L.). \n \n 2\nIntroduction \n \nTwo objectives of European and British agricultural policy are the reduction of agricultural \nsurpluses and increased tree planting on farms.  However tree planting on farms in lowland \nBritain has often seemed unattractive because of the time required to produce marketable \ntimber.  To some extent, this constraint has been reduced by the introduction of fast-\ngrowing hybrid clones of poplar (Populus spp) from Belgium that are able to produce a \nharvestable timber crop in 25 years (Potter et al., 1990; Tabbush, 1995). \n A second constraint to the planting of trees is the negative cash flow between planting \nand harvest.  However, because poplars are sometimes planted at low density (156 trees ha-\n1) and left unthinned throughout the rotation (Beaton, 1987; Tabbush, 1995), one method of \nmaintaining a positive cash flow in the initial years, in the absence of government \nsubsidies, is to grow an arable crop between the trees - a practice known in Europe as \nsilvoarable agroforestry.  Such a practice was successfully implemented by Bryant and \nMay (Forestry) Ltd on their estates in East Anglia and Herefordshire, UK during the 1960s \nand 1970s (Jobling, 1990).  Financial analyses have also predicted that agroforestry with \nthe new hybrids of poplar could again be viable on good arable land in the UK (Willis et \nal., 1993). \n However the predicted profitability of a silvoarable practice depends on the actual \ninteraction between tree growth and crop yield.  In 1992, a silvoarable experiment with \npoplar was established at a national network of three lowland sites in England to investigate \nthe effect of the interaction on profitability.  This paper describes the experiment and \nreports some of the measurements of tree growth and crop yield during the first seven \nyears.  \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nSites and climate \n \nThe sites are in three of the major arable areas in lowland England (Table 1).  The wettest \nand most westerly site is on the Royal Agricultural College Farm at Fosse Hill near \nCirencester in Gloucestershire (lat. 51\u00b044\u2019N, long. 2\u00b00\u2019W).  The coolest and most northerly \nsite is on the Leeds University Farms near Tadcaster in West Yorkshire (lat. 53\u00b053\u2019N, long. \n1\u00b015\u2019W); the warmest and driest site is at Silsoe in Bedfordshire (lat. 52\u00b00\u2019N, long. \n0\u00b026\u2019W) in eastern England.  The soil textures at the Cirencester, Leeds and Silsoe sites are \nclay loam over limestone, sandy clay loam over limestone, and clay over clay respectively. \n \nPoplar hybrids \n \nFour poplar hybrids were chosen to represent the major groups of poplars being grown in \nBritain.  Trichobel is an intraspecific hybrid of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa \nTorrey & A. Gray ex Hook.), a species originally from western North America.  Gibecq is \na \u2018euramericana\u2019 hybrid produced by crossing eastern cottonwood from eastern North \nAmerica (Populus deltoides Bartram ex Marshall) with European native black poplar \n(Populus nigra L.).  Beaupr\u00e9 is an \u2018interamericana\u2019 hybrid, produced by crossing the two \ncottonwood species from North America.  Trichobel, Gibecq and Beaupr\u00e9 were bred at the \nPoplar Research Centre at Geraardsbergen, Belgium in the 1960s, and imported into the \n 3\nUK in 1985 (Jobling, 1990).  Robusta is a natural \u2018euramericana\u2019 hybrid originally selected \nin the 1890s in the north-east of France (Jobling, 1990).  \n \nTable 1.

The poplar hybrids were planted between March and April 1992 as 1.5-2.0 m \nunrooted sets to a depth of 0.6 m, at intervals of 6.4 m in a North-South direction in rows \n10 m apart, along parallel lengths of 1.5-m-wide black polythene-film mulch.  The edges of \nthe plastic were buried under the soil mechanically to leave an exposed strip of plastic 1-m-\nwide.  Along each row, the four hybrids were planted as contiguous groups of five trees, \nwith a guard tree (buffer) at each end of each row. \n Each autumn, an 8-m-wide strip was ploughed, in the middle of each 10-m-wide alley, \nleaving the tree row as an uncultivated 2-m-wide strip, including the polythene mulch.  \nThis deep cultivation broke any poplar roots in the top 20 cm of the arable area.   Within \neach block, six alleys were allocated in adjacent pairs to three arable treatments designated \nas \u2018continuously-fallow\u2019, \u2018continuously-cropped\u2019 and \u2018alternately-cropped\u2019.  Hence every \nsecond row of poplars, termed a \u2018measurement\u2019 row (M, Fig. 1), was subjected to one of \nthree arable treatments.  The two adjacent alleys comprising the continuously-fallow \ntreatment were regularly cultivated so that the measurement row of poplars between them \nwould have minimal competition from crops or weeds.  The continuously-cropped \ntreatment comprised a rotation of two to four years of cereals in two adjacent alleys \nfollowed by a break (non-cereal) crop.  In the alternately-cropped treatment, the alley on \none side of the measurement row of trees was cropped whilst the alley on the opposite side \nwas kept fallow; the cropped and the fallow areas were reversed each year. \n 4 \n    \u2190\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af Block I\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2192 \u2190\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af Block II \u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2192 \u2190\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af Block III \u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u23af\u2192   \n Cropping   \n treatment \nContinuous \ncropping \nM \nAlternate \ncropping \nM \nContinuous\nfallow \nM \nContinuous \nfallow \nM \nContinuous \ncropping \nM \nAlternate \ncropping \nM \nAlternate \ncropping \nM \nContinuous\nfallow \nM \nContinuous \ncropping \nM   \n                    \n    \u2191 \n                   5 trees \n   Robusta     Beaupr\u00e9     Beaupr\u00e9   x  \n                   6.4 m \n                   \u2193 \n     \n                    \n   Beaupr\u00e9     Gibecq     Trichobel    \n                    \n                    \n     \n                     \n   Trichobel     Trichobel     Robusta    \n                    \n                    \n     \n                    \n   Gibecq     Robusta     Gibecq    \n                    \n                    \n     \n        \u2192 10 m \u2190 \n \nFigure 1.

In each case, the crops were harvested between the following July and \nSeptember and hence only one crop was harvested each year.  Starting in 1992, the rotation \nat Cirencester comprised three crops of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), field beans (Vicia \nfaba L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley, and field beans.  Also starting in 1992, the \nrotation at Leeds comprised barley, peas (Pisum sativum L.), two crops of wheat, barley, \nmustard (Brassica alba L.), and wheat.  At Silsoe, following poor crop yields in the initial \nthree years, a wheat crop was harvested in 1995, followed by two wheat crops and field \nbeans.  \n The cropped areas were managed in the same way as commercial crops, receiving \nstandard applications of fertiliser, herbicides, fungicides and insecticides as appropriate.  At \nLeeds and Cirencester the mid-point of the tractor tramlines was offset 6 m from the edge \nof the measurement tree row; at Silsoe it was centred in the alley 4 m from the edge of the \ntree row.  Lastly the fourth arable treatment, a \u2018control area\u2019 adjacent to the main \nexperiment, but at least 15 m from the base of the nearest poplar, was managed in the same \nway as the continuously-cropped treatment.  \n \nMeasurements and analysis of data \n \nFrom 1992, the height of each tree in the measurement row of each arable treatment was \nmeasured each winter between November and March.  From 1994 at Cirencester and \nLeeds, and from 1995 at Silsoe, the diameters of the same trees were measured at breast \nheight (1.3 m above the ground) each winter.   \n Each year, the grain, bean or pea yield, within each poplar-hybrid x arable-treatment \nplot was determined by harvesting with a plot combine at three distances from the trees in \nthe measurement row.  The approximate distances were: 1.0-2.5 m, 2.5-4.0 m and 4.0-5.5 \nm giving three sub-plots in each alternately-cropped treatment and six sub-plots in each \ncontinuously-cropped treatment.  Corresponding measurements were also taken within the \ncontrol area; within a specific year the number of replicates ranged from 1 to 24 at \nCirencester and from 12 to 27 at Silsoe.  A consistent 24 measurements of control yield \nwere taken each year at Leeds.  The dry matter yield of the spring mustard \u2018cover\u2019 crop, at \nLeeds in 1997, was determined by measuring the total yield of fresh mass of the above-\nground part of each sub-plot of the crop and taking sub-samples for dry matter \ndetermination. \n The crop yield data were analysed by ANOVA (SAS) in a split\/split plot design.  \nBecause there were only three replicate cropped alleys in the alternately-cropped treatment, \nthe design was not balanced in terms of the number of replicates with a westerly or an \neasterly aspect relative to the measurement row of trees.  Therefore each year the yields \nfrom the continuously-cropped treatment were analysed first to determine the effect of the \nwest-east aspect.  If there was no effect of aspect then the whole experiment (continuously- \nand alternately-cropped treatments) was analysed as one set to determine the effect of the \narable treatment.  If there was an effect of aspect (as at Cirencester in 1993, at Leeds in \n1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, and at Silsoe in 1998) then in the comparison of continuously-\ncropped and alternately-cropped treatments only those continuous plots which had the \nsame aspect as the alternate plots were included in the analysis.  The control crop data were \nanalysed by a two-way ANOVA and compared with the other treatments by t-test at P = \n0.05. \n 6\n In order to assess shading by the trees, total short-wave solar radiation was measured \nbeneath three Trichobel trees at the Silsoe site at monthly intervals between 24 April and \n24 July 1997.  At this time, the mean height of the three trees was 7.6 m, the mean canopy \ndepth was 5.0 m, and the mean maximum canopy diameter was 3.9 m.  Below each tree, \nfive tube solarimeters which had been calibrated against a standard Kipp solarimeter, were \nplaced along a 10-m transect centred on the tree and perpendicular to the tree-row.  A sixth \nsolarimeter was placed outside the experiment where there was no significant shading.   \n \nSilvoarable management \n \nThe successful management of a silvoarable practice requires two additional activities \nnot usually associated with traditional forestry or agriculture.  First, in order to produce \nthe maximum volume of high quality knot-free timber, the branches of the poplar were \npruned before they reached a diameter of 5 cm (Jobling, 1990).  The lowest branches \nwere removed during the first year after planting, and subsequently whorls were \nremoved during the second, fourth, sixth and seventh year.  The trees at Cirencester and \nSilsoe were pruned between harvest and autumn cultivation.  After 1995, the trees at \nLeeds were pruned during the winter.  Second, it was necessary to manage the \nunderstorey vegetation in the tree row between the edge of the black plastic mulch and \nthe crop i.e. in two strips 50-cm wide.  At Leeds and Cirencester, this vegetation was \ncontrolled as required by herbicide (glyphosate) applied from a knapsack sprayer.  At \nSilsoe, the vegetation was controlled with a hand-held petrol-driven strim-mower. \n \nRESULTS \n \nEstablishment of trees  \n \nDuring the first year, the proportion of sets in the measurement rows, which did not \nestablish, ranged from 9-10% at Silsoe and Cirencester to 34% at Leeds (Table 2).  \nAcross the three sites, the losses ranged from 4% for Beaupr\u00e9 to 37% for Robusta.  The \nloss over all hybrids in the year of establishment was 18%.  The particularly poor \nestablishment of two hybrids at Leeds may have been linked to the greater exposure of the \nsite to wind and the relatively shallow topsoil (Table 1).  Although the dead trees were \nreplaced with healthy transplants at the end of the first season, the differences in the \nproportions replaced would have affected subsequent height and diameter measurements. \n \nTable 2.

Although there \nwas no significant (P<0.05) interaction between hybrid and arable treatment, there were \ninteractions between hybrid and site on height (P<0.05) and diameter (P<0.05). \n The main effect of site was that the height of the trees at Cirencester and Silsoe \n(10.4 m) was greater (P<0.01) than that at Leeds (9.2 m) (Table 3).  In contrast the \ndiameters of the trees at Cirencester and Silsoe (156 and 155 mm) were less (P<0.01) \nthan that at Leeds (173 mm). \n The main effect of hybrid across the sites was that the height of Beaupr\u00e9 (11.9 m) \nwas 21-34% greater than those for the other three hybrids (8.9-9.8 m).  Likewise, the \ndiameter of Beaupr\u00e9 (189 mm) was 18-28% greater than the diameters of the other three \nhybrids (148-160 mm).  At each of the three sites, the heights of Trichobel and Robusta \nwere similar.  A significant site x hybrid (tree) interaction was that the diameter of \nGibecq was less (P<0.05) than that of Trichobel at Cirencester, the opposite of that at \nSilsoe.  The relatively poor growth of Trichobel at Silsoe is probably, in part, a result of \nthe poor establishment of this hybrid at Silsoe in the year of planting (Table 2).  \n \nTable 3.

An even greater difference was apparent in the \nmeasurements of diameter.  The diameters of the poplars in the continuously-cropped \ntreatment (133-156 mm) were only 75-83% of those in the continuously-fallow treatment \n(174-188 mm).  The heights and diameters in the alternately-cropped treatment were \nintermediate in value.  \n 8\nTable 4.

However the effect of the arable treatment on the annual increase in \nheight varied with year, and in 1994 and 1997 there were significant (P < 0.05) site x arable \ntreatment interactions.  In the second season after planting (1993), which was particularly \nwet between April and August, at each site the increases in tree height were similar in the \nthree arable treatments (Table 5).  During the third season (1994) at Cirencester and the \nthird and fourth seasons (1994 and 1995) at Leeds, the increase in tree height in the \ncontinuously-fallow treatment was greater (P<0.05) than that in the continuously-cropped \ntreatment.  After this, the effect of arable treatment on the increase in tree height was not \nsignificant.  By contrast at Silsoe, which was often the driest site, the arable treatments had \na significant effect on the annual increase in tree height during the third, fourth, fifth, sixth \nand seventh seasons (1994-1998) after planting.  For each of the last four seasons, the \nincrease in tree height in the continuously-fallow treatment was greater (P<0.05) than that \nin the continuously-cropped treatment (Table 5). \n \nTable 5.

By contrast, due to management problems, the yields obtained at the Silsoe site \nbetween 1992 and 1994 were very low and therefore they are not presented.  The control \nyields obtained from the winter wheat at Silsoe between 1995 and 1997 were acceptable \n(5.4-7.8 t ha-1) but still relatively low. \n In 1992, the year that the poplars were planted, the crop yields in the alleys at \nCirencester and Leeds were greater than those in the control areas (Table 7).  In contrast, \nbetween 1995 and 1998, when the trees were larger, the yields in the continuously-cropped \ntreatment at Cirencester and Leeds were less than those in the control areas.   At Silsoe, \nwhere the overall yields were lower, the first significant difference between the yields in \nthe continuously-cropped treatment and the control area occurred in 1998.  Overall during \nthe first three years after planting, the yield in the continuously-cropped treatment at \nCirencester and Leeds was 4% less than that in the corresponding control area.  Between \nthe fourth and the sixth years after planting, the yield reduction across the three sites was \n10%, and in the seventh year, the reduction at Leeds and Silsoe was 14%. \n \n 10\n \nTable 7.

On two of these occasions there was no significant difference in the \nyields between the continuously- and alternately-cropped treatments (in 1996 at Leeds and \nin 1997 at Silsoe).  However on six of the eight occasions (in 1993, 1994 and 1997 at \nCirencester; in 1995 at Leeds, and in 1995 and 1996 at Silsoe), the yield in the alternately-\ncropped treatment was significantly (P<0.05) greater than that in the continuously-cropped \ntreatment.  The increase in yield across the eight occasions was 11%. \n Between 1993 and 1998, there were also four occasions when a successful break crop \n(beans, peas, or mustard) was grown in the continuously-cropped treatment (Table 7).  On \nthree of these occasions (in 1994 and 1997 at Leeds and in 1998 at Silsoe) the yield in the \nalternately-cropped treatment was significantly less (P<0.05) than that in the continuously-\ncropped treatment.  Across the four occasions, the yield in the alternately-cropped \ntreatment was 5% less than that in the continuously-cropped treatment.   \n On the three occasions when a cereal crop was grown after a break crop in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment, the corresponding yield in the alternately-cropped \ntreatment was once significantly higher (in 1996 at Cirencester) and twice significantly \nlower (in 1994 and 1998 at Leeds).   \n 11\nDISCUSSION \n \nChoice of poplar hybrid \n \nThe superior performance of Beaupr\u00e9, an interamericana hybrid, relative to P. trichocarpa \nand euramericana hybrids, across each of the three sites in this trial, is similar to the \nresponse of Beaupr\u00e9 compared to P. trichocarpa and euramericana hybrids across nine \nsites in England, Scotland, and Wales reported by Tabbush and Beaton (1998).  The fact \nthat Beaupr\u00e9 has shown the greatest height and diameter across a range of sites suggests \nthat it is generally well-adapted to most lowland environments in the UK.  Milne et al. \n(1992) and Souch and Stephens (1998) have related the high growth rate of Beaupr\u00e9, in \ncomparison to Robusta and Trichobel, to the development of a larger leaf area and hence a \ncapacity to intercept a higher proportion of radiation.   Although this might be expected to \ncause a greater reduction in crop yields, during the seven years Beaupr\u00e9 did not show a \ngreater effect on crop yields than the other three hybrids.  This is probably a result of the \npruning regime which maintained the canopy depth of each tree equal to approximately \nhalf of the tree height.   \n Because of the high growth rate, some farmers in the UK have recently planted \nmonocultures of Beaupr\u00e9.  Although this may appear sensible based on timber production \nmeasurements alone, large blocks of a single hybrid can be particularly vulnerable to new \nstrains of disease.  At the end of 1997 and in 1998, the Beaupr\u00e9 trees at the Cirencester site \nwere particularly affected by a new race of the leaf rust Melampsora larici-populina \n(Lonsdale and Tabbush, 1998) previously only reported in Continental Europe.  This may \nexplain, in part, the reduction in the annual diameter increment of the poplar in the \ncontinuously-fallow treatment at Cirencester from 34-36 mm between 1995 and 1997 to \nonly 19 mm in 1998 (Table 6).  Although in 1998, the cumulative growth of Beaupr\u00e9 was \nstill superior to the other three hybrids, in order to minimise disease susceptibility Lonsdale \nand Tabbush (1998) recommend planting a mixture of cultivars of differing genetic origins. \n \nTimber formation \n \nThe individual measurements of tree height for each hybrid in the fallow treatment at the \nend of 1998 (seven-years after planting) can be used to determine a value for the \u2018top \nheight\u2019, which in turn can be used to predict the maximum mean annual increment of \ntimber volume (yield class) for that stand.  The \u2018top height\u2019 is the mean height of those \nhundred trees per hectare with the largest diameter at breast height (Hamilton, 1975), and \ntherefore it ignores the heights of the smallest third of the trees at a density of 156 trees per \nhectare.  Using the tables presented by Christie (1994) for a density equivalent to 156 trees \nper hectare, the predicted maximum mean annual increment for Beaupr\u00e9 within the \ncontinuously-fallow plots ranged from 14 m3 ha-1 a-1 at Leeds to 20 m3 ha-1 a-1 at \nCirencester (Table 8).   \n However the above analysis ignores the fact that the trees at Leeds have a substantially \nlarger diameter for a given height, than the trees at Cirencester and Silsoe (Table 8).  An \nalternative method for comparing the relative productivity of the three sites is to calculate \nthe cumulative timber production (V; m3 ha-1) from the number of trees (N; trees ha-1), the \nmean height (h; m), the mean diameter at breast height (dbh; m) and a form factor (f) \n(Philip, 1994) (Equation 1). \n 12\n fdbhhNV\n2\n2\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= \u03c0    Equation 1 \nAssuming 156 trees ha-1 and a form factor for seven-year-old poplar of 37% (Hamilton, \n1975), and using the values for the mean height and diameter for Beaupr\u00e9 in the \ncontinuously-fallow treatment (Table 8), the estimated timber volume of the trees at Leeds \nis similar to those at Silsoe.  These results show that it can be misleading to predict a yield \nclass for widely-spaced poplar based on measurements of top height alone.  The greater \ndiameter growth per increment of height growth for poplar at Leeds, relative to Silsoe, is \nprobably a result of the greater exposure of the site to wind (Table 1).  \n The predicted maximum mean annual increments of 14 to 20 m3 ha-1 for Beaupr\u00e9 \nindicates the superior performance of this cultivar to the other three cultivars in the trial.  \nJobling (1990) reported maximum mean annual increments for traditional poplar cultivars, \nsuch as Robusta, as being in the range of 4 to 14 m3 ha-1.  Beaupr\u00e9, growing on a sheltered \nvalley site at Old Wolverton near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, UK has been \nreported by Newman et al. (1995) as having an even greater maximum mean annual \nincrement of 26 m3 ha-1.  Such differences in volume production indicates that careful site \nselection is critical if new poplar hybrids are to achieve the maximum mean annual \nincrements of 22 to 28 m3 ha-1 used in some financial analyses of silvoarable agroforestry  \n(Willis et al., 1993).   \n \nTable 8.  The predicted maximum mean annual increment in timber volume for Beaupr\u00e9 in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment, based on the top height seven years after planting and an \ninterpolation of Christie\u2019s (1994) provisional tables for poplar, at each of three lowland sites in \nEngland. \n  Site  \nCharacteristic Cirencester Leeds Silsoe \nTop height (m)  13.7  11.8  13.1 \nPredicted maximum mean annual increment (m3 ha-1 a-1)  20  14  18 \nHeight (m)  13.0  11.6  12.7 \nDiameter at breast height (mm)  212  218  203 \nEstimated  timber volume at seven years1 (m3 ha-1)   26  24  24 \n1 The estimated timber volume after seven years, is based on top height, diameter and a form factor of 37%. \n \nEffect of the arable treatments on tree growth \n \nAfter seven years, the mean height and the diameter of the trees in the continuously-\ncropped treatment were respectively 10% and 21% less than those in the continuously-\nfallow treatment (Table 3).  Assuming a form factor of 37%, the estimated marketable \ntimber from the seven-year-old trees in the continuously-cropped treatment would be only \n56% of that in the continuously-fallow treatment.  This is similar to reductions in tree \ngrowth rates of 20-60% caused by competition with grass in a silvopastoral system \n(Campbell et al., 1994).   \n The principal cause of the lower tree growth rates in the continuously-cropped, \ncompared to the continuously-fallow treatment, is likely to be competition for water and\/or \nnutrients.  In an investigation of the effects of a competing grass crop on the growth of \napple trees, Hipps et al. (1990) reported that the availability of water was probably a more \nimportant limiting factor than nitrogen.  Certainly an important role for water is supported \n 13\nby the observation that the effect of the arable treatment on height increment was \nparticularly strong during the dry summer of 1995 (Table 5). \n The possibility of significant competition between the trees and the crop for water was \nalso indicated in a detailed study of the soil water content within an alternately-cropped \ntreatment at Silsoe during 1995 (Burgess et al., 1996).  Between 27 April and 3 August \n1995, the decline in the soil water content within the cropped area of winter wheat and the \nuncultivated 2-m wide area at the base of a Beaupr\u00e9 hybrid (141-192 mm) was \nsubstantially more than the decline within the fallow area (5-127 mm).  Souch (1996), \ncomparing the responses of two-year-old poplar hybrids, reported that Beaupr\u00e9 showed a \nreduction in transpiration once the soil water potential reached \u221243 kPa, and that each \nsubsequent litre reduction in water use resulted in approximately 4.4 kg less total dry \nmatter production.  At the site at Silsoe, a soil water potential of \u221243 kPa is equivalent to a \ndeficit of about 50 mm within the top metre of soil (Burgess et al., 1996).  These results \nindicate that during a dry summer, the availability of water in the soil beneath an autumn-\nsown crop is likely to be less than that within a fallow.  The implication is therefore that \nthis reduction is sufficient to cause a difference in the growth of recently-established trees. \n The above results suggest that, during a dry summer, the water use of an arable crop \ncould be sufficient to reduce the growth of recently-planted poplar, compared to the \nsituation where the poplar was surrounded by a bare-earth fallow.  This is despite the arable \ncrop being cultivated at a distance of at least 1 m from the base of the trees and weed \ngrowth at the base of the trees being suppressed by a black plastic mulch.  \n \nThe effect of the experimental silvoarable system on crop yields \n \nThe first effect of the experimental silvoarable system on crop yields is a direct reduction in \nthe cropped area.  The practical experience across the network sites was that the tree rows \nshould have a minimum width of 2 m to minimise the risk of damage to the trees from \nagricultural machinery, and vice versa.  Hence as the tree row spacing on the trial sites was \n10 m, it was only possible to crop 80% of the original area.  Obviously, the proportion of \nthe uncultivated land will decrease if the spacing between the trees is greater.  In fact as \nmost agricultural machinery in the UK is designed to work at widths of 12, 18 or 24 m, \nafter allowing 2 m for the tree row, a spacing of 14, 20 or 26 m, between tree rows is likely \nto be more appropriate than 10 m on commercial farms.   \n Across the three sites, in the presence of trees, the yield per unit cropped area, \nrelative to the crop yield in the control areas, was an average of 4% less in the first three \nyears and an average of 10% less between years four and six.  These reductions are \nsubstantially less than decreases of 31, 36 and 82% reported by Newman et al. (1995) \nfor spring wheat and barley under three, five and six-year-old poplar respectively when \nplanted at a particularly close spacing of 14 m x 1 m and with a predicted yield class of \n26 (i.e. the predicted maximum mean annual increment, if the spacing had been 8 m x 8 \nm, would be 26 m3 ha-1 a-1).  However they are comparable to a yield reduction of 9% \nreported for spring wheat below six-year-old poplar, also with a yield class of 26, at a \nspacing of 14 m x 6 m in Buckinghamshire, UK (Newman et al., 1995).  The possible \nreasons for the effect of the trees on the yields in the continuously-cropped treatment \ninclude shading, competition for water (Foulkes et al., 1993), the ingress of weeds \n(Milsom et al., 1994), and slug damage (Griffiths et al., 1994). \n 14\n The potential effect of shading by the trees on the yield of an understorey crop (Y; g \nm-2), such as wheat, can be directly related to the incident short-wave solar radiation (S; \nMJ m-2), assuming that the proportion of radiation intercepted by the crop canopy (fS; \n%), the ratio of total dry matter production to intercepted radiation (\u03b5S ;g MJ-1), and the \nharvest index (HI) remain constant (Monteith, 1977) (Equation 2). \n HIfSY ss \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5= \u03b5  (Equation 2) \nUsing a more detailed model of the growth and development responses of winter wheat \nto radiation, Kocabas et al. (1993) indicated that a 20% reduction in radiation \nthroughout the growing season would result in a 15% lower yield.   \nThe tube-solarimeter measurements taken at Silsoe between April and July \n1997, six-years after planting, indicated that the amount of short-wave radiation beneath \nthe five-year-old trees was only 82% and 88% of that in the control treatment, at \ndistances of 2.5 m and 4.5 m perpendicular to the tree row respectively.  Such a \nreduction in radiation would appear sufficient to explain why the yields in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment at Cirencester and Leeds were only 85% of those in the \ncontrol treatment.  In contrast the lack of an effect of trees on crop yield and the \nrelatively low winter cereal yields at Silsoe (5.4 t ha-1) suggests that a factor or factors \nother than solar radiation were constraining yields at that site. \n The influence of shade rather than competition for nutrients in constraining the \nyield of the arable crops, is also supported by the observation that the poplar had a \ngreater effect on the yield of break crops than that of winter cereals.  For example, \nbetween 1995 and 1998, the yield of the spring mustard and winter beans in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment was only 79% of that in the control treatment.  In \ncontrast over the same time period, the yield of the winter cereals in the continuously-\ncropped treatment was 93% of that in the control (Table 7).  Such an effect would be \nexpected, as the spring mustard and the winter bean crops were planted and harvested \nlater than the winter cereals.  Hence the peak light requirement of such crops is likely to \ncoincide with the period from July to October when the poplars intercept the most light.  \n \nThe alternately-cropped treatment \n \nOn the eight occasions, when a cereal crop was preceded by another cereal crop in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment, the mean crop yield in the alternately-cropped treatment \nwas 11% greater than that in the continuously-cropped treatment.  A similar increase of \n12% across five sites was also reported by Froment and Grylls (1992), when the yield from \nwheat, immediately following a bare fallow was compared to the yield of continuous wheat \nin the maritime temperate climate of Britain.  Froment and Grylls (1992) related the high \nyields after the bare fallow to an increase in the soil mineral nitrogen content.   \n In contrast on three of the four occasions when a break crop was grown, the yield in the \ncontinuously-cropped treatment was greater than that in the alternately-cropped treatment.  \nOverall, across the four occasions, the yield in the alternately-cropped treatment was 5% \nlower than that in the continuously-cropped treatment.  These results suggest that break \ncrops gain minimal yield benefit from being preceded by a fallow rather than a cereal crop.  \nA possible reason for the lower yield in the alternately-cropped treatment is that the trees \nhad both taller and broader canopies than those in the continuously-cropped treatment \n(Table 4). \n 15\n Although the exact response depends on the crop combination, as discussed above, the \nindividual yields per cropped area within the alternately-cropped treatment were between \n80% and 120% of that from the continuously-cropped treatment (Table 7).  However when \nthe yields are expressed in terms of the total area, there is obviously a large reduction in \nyield because only 8 m out of every 20 m were sown to an arable crop; this is half the area \nwithin the continuously-cropped treatment.  Therefore if the alternately-cropped treatment \nis to be used commercially, the economic costs of only planting a small proportion of the \narea, must be outweighed by increased returns from the trees or savings in management \ncosts. \n An important potential advantage for management of the alternately-cropped treatment \nis that the fallow alleys allow year-round access to the poplar trees for pruning.  In contrast \nif all of the alleys are allocated to continuous autumn-sown crops, then in order to minimise \ndamage to crops, pruning activities may be limited to August and September between the \nharvest of one crop and the cultivation for the next.  These are amongst the busiest months \non arable farms and the availability of labour for pruning is likely to be minimal unless \nspecialist pruners are employed.  Secondly in the 1960s and 1970s, Bryant and May used \nalternate-cropping because, as the poplar trees sometimes delayed the harvesting of one \ncrop, it would still allow the sowing of the next season\u2019s crop.  Although this effect may be \napparent in the future as the trees grow, there has been no noticeable delay in the harvesting \nof the crops within the alleys during the first seven years. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe analysis of the first seven years of tree growth and crop yields reported in this paper \nprovides an initial basis for comparing the productivity and profitability of this \nexperimental silvoarable system with conventional arable cropping and poplar \nproduction practices (Burgess et al., 2000).  Future work will investigate the tree-crop \ninteractions beyond the first seven years and assess the most profitable combination of \npoplar and arable crop for a given site. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food sponsored the research between \n1992 and 1995 and in 1997.
