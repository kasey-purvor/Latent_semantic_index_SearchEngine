INTRODUCTION\nThis case, popularly known as Heyday, was referred to the ECJ by the High Court, which is hearing a claim by  Age  Concern  that\nexemptions in the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 SI 2006\/1031 do not comply  with  the  parent  Council  Directive\n2000\/78\/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The central  challenge  is  to  the\ndefault retirement age, provided by reg 30, which permits employers to dismiss workers aged 65 or over simply  on  the  ground  of\n\u2018retirement\u2019. A further challenge is to the objective justification defence for direct discrimination provided by  reg  3,  which  could\nbe used to justify retirements falling outside of the default retirement age.\nThe judgment is a major disappointment for all but those familiar with the reference, because it did not decide the central\nquestion of the lawfulness of the default retirement age. Rather than place this question in the hands  of  the  ECJ,  the  High  Court\nreferred three rather technical issues (couched as five questions). First, whether the Directive applied to the default  retirement  and\nobjective justification  provisions.  Second,  whether  the  general  justification  defence  for  direct  discrimination  (in  reg  3)  was\ncompatible with the Directive. Third, whether there was a practical difference between the tests of objective  justification  provided\nin the Directive by Article 2(2)(b)(i) (the orthodox formula for  indirect  discrimination)  and  Article  6(1)  (allowing  for  defences\nagainst age discrimination). The ECJ held: (1) the Directive did apply to the  provisions;  (2)  the  Directive  permitted  the  general\njustification defence to direct discrimination in reg 3 if the defence itself could be objectively  justified  in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate\nsocial policy aim under Article  6(1);  (3)  the  tests  were  different  in  scope,  but  Article  6(1)  still  demanded  a  measure  to  be\nobjectively justified \u2018to a high standard of proof\u2019.\nThe significant answers are that the Directive permits a general defence to direct age discrimination (such as  that  in  reg\n3), and that justification under Article 6(1) must be in pursuit of a social policy objective. This last aspect is particularly relevant to\nthe defence to  direct  discrimination  in  reg  3  because  its  general  nature  (permitting  defences  to  unspecified  and  unforeseen\nscenarios) makes it hard to square with a social policy objective. The Court offered some general  guidance  on  the  application  of\nArticle 6 to the defence in reg 3. The judgment was less helpful on the default retirement age. As a specific defence,  there  was  no\nquestion that it fell within Article 6 (once the first issue was resolved). But no guidance was provided on the application of  Article\n6(1) to the default retirement age. On the meaning of Article 6(1), the judgment was general, and at times ambiguous, which leaves\nit vulnerable to selective interpretation. As such, when the case returns to the High Court to  decide  the  lawfulness  of  the  default\nretirement age, the court may find more guidance from previous ECJ case law, than from this judgment.\n2. THE LEGISLATION\nArticle 2(2) of the Directive defines direct and indirect discrimination in the orthodox manner, providing (in paragraph  2(b)(i))  an\nobjective justification defence for indirect discrimination only. However, Article 6(1) provides a more  specific  defence  for  direct\nand indirect age discrimination:\nJustification of differences of treatment on grounds of age\nNotwithstanding Article 2(2), Member States may provide  that  differences  of  treatment  on  grounds  of  age  shall  not\nconstitute discrimination, if, within  the  context  of  national  law,  they  are  objectively  and  reasonably  justified  by  a\nlegitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour  market  and  vocational  training  objectives,  and  if  the\nmeans of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.\nArticle 6 then offers a non-exhaustive list of three examples of different treatment that could be justified under  this  formula,  none\nof which are relevant to this case.\nRecital 25 in the preamble appears to explain Article 6(1). It provides:\n...  differences  in  treatment  in  connection  with  age   may   be   justified   under   certain\ncircumstances and therefore require  specific  provisions  which  may  vary  in  accordance\nwith  the  situation  in  Member  States.  It  is  therefore  essential  to  distinguish   between\ndifferences in treatment which are justified, in particular by legitimate employment policy,\nlabour  market  and  vocational  training  objectives,  and  discrimination  which   must   be\nprohibited.\nRecital 14 states rather cryptically: \u2018This Directive shall be without prejudice to  national  provisions  laying  down  retirement\nages.\u2019\nRegulation 3 of the Age Regulations 2006 defines direct and indirect discrimination in the orthodox way,  but  unlike  the\n\u2018parallel\u2019 Article 2 of the Directive, it offers the objective justification defence to both indirect and direct discrimination. \nRegulation 30 provides the more specific exception for retirement:\n(2) Nothing .... shall render unlawful the dismissal of a person to whom this regulation applies at or  over  the  age  of  65\nwhere the reason for the dismissal is retirement.\nThis is  the  controversial  default  retirement  age,  a  blanket  exemption  from  the  age  discrimination  principle  available  to  all\nemployers and permitting dismissal simply on the ground  of  \u2018retirement\u2019.  Employers  need  not  provide  any  other  justification.\nHowever, by reg 30(1), this only applies to:\nan employee within the meaning of section 230(1) of the [Employment Rights] 1996, a person in Crown  employment,  a\nrelevant member of the House of Commons staff, and a relevant member of the House of Lords staff.\nThis is of narrower application than the Regulations  generally.  It  does  not  include,  for  instance,  partnerships.  Regulation  7(4)\nprovides  a  supplementary  exception  permitting  employers  not  to  recruit  anyone  approaching  (i.e.  within  6  months  of)  the\nemployer\u2019s normal retirement age, or if it does not have one, 65.\n                The defence of objective justification for direct discrimination in reg 3 comes into play where a  retirement  falls  outside\nof the default retirement age, for example, retirement of workers under 65 (early retirement), or retirement  from  a  partnership.  In\nthese cases - unlike the default retirement age - each retirement must be objectively justified.\n3. THE FIRST ISSUE - DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\nThe first issue for the Court was whether the Directive applied to exemptions from the age discrimination principle. The Court held\n(at paras 21-30) that it did, despite Recital 14 of the Preamble, which was confined to \u2018the  competence  of  the  Member  States  to\ndetermine retirement age.\u2019 (Citing Case C-411\/05 Palacios de la Villa [2007] ECR I-8531, [44]). This is settled law  and  relatively\nuncontroversial, and requires no further comment.\n4. THE SECOND ISSUE - RETIREMENT OUTSIDE OF THE DEFAULT RETIREMENT AGE\nThe next issue was whether the Directive permitted the general objective justification defence  for  direct  discrimination  in  reg  3.\nThe significance of reg 3 in this context is that it provides a defence for retirement outside of  the  default  retirement  age,  such  as\nearly retirement or retirement from a partnership. The problem is that reg 3 goes beyond the \u2018parallel\u2019 (and orthodox) definition  of\ndiscrimination in the Directive (Article 2), which limits the defence to indirect discrimination. Thus,  Article  6  provided  the  only\npossibility of legitimising the broader defence in reg 3.\nThe Court observed that early retirement could fall under the justification defence in reg  3\n(para 34). Age Concern and the EC Commission \u2013  relying  on  Recital  25  (above)  -  argued  that\nArticle 6 permitted only express specific exemptions to discrimination. The UK (and Italy) argued\nthat Article 6 permitted a general exemption such as the defence in reg 3. The Court  rejected  Age\nConcern\u2019s position, but only went some way to agreeing with the UK. Although Article 6  did  not\nrequire Member States to draw up a specific list of exemptions (para 43), and that  Member  States\nretained \u2018a broad discretion as to the choice of methods\u2019 of  implementation  of  a  Directive  (para\n41), this was provided that the legal position  is  \u2018sufficiently  precise  and  clear  and  the  persons\nconcerned can ascertain the full extent of their rights ...\u2019. Perhaps with  reg  3  in  mind,  the  Court\nadded \u2018A directive  may  also  be  implemented  by  way  of  a  general  measure  provided  that  it\nsatisfies the same conditions\u2019 (para 42).\nHowever,  Article  6  makes  clear  that  such  exceptions   have   to   be   \u2018objectively   and\nreasonably\u2019  justified.  Of  course,  this  requires  that  the  defence  has  a  legitimate  aim,  and  is\nappropriate and necessary to achieve that aim. Further,  the  Court  held,  Article  6  restricts  these\naims to social policy objectives and so \u2018By their public interest nature,  [they]  are  distinguishable\nfrom purely individual reasons particular to the employer\u2019s  situation,  such  as  cost  reduction  or\nimproving competitiveness ... although it cannot be ruled out that a national rule may recognise, in\nthe pursuit of those legitimate aims, a certain degree of flexibility for employers\u2019 (para  46).  Such\naims may be identified from the \u2018general context\u2019 of reg 3 (citing Palacios de la Villa,  [57])  (para\n45).\nThe  Court  offered  some  guidance  on  the  matter  of  whether  the  general   justification\ndefence for direct discrimination in reg 3 was proportionate, or \u2018appropriate and  necessary\u2019.  This\nincluded taking account of other (presumably less discriminatory) means to achieve the aim  (para\n50).  The  Court  noted  that  the  broad  discretion  \u2018cannot  have   the   effect   of   frustrating   the\nimplementation  of  the  principle  of  non-discrimination  on  grounds  of  age.\u2019  And  that   \u2018Mere\ngeneralisations concerning the capacity of a specific measure to contribute to employment  policy,\nlabour market or vocational training objectives are not enough ... and  do  not  constitute  evidence\non the basis of which it could reasonably be  considered  that  the  means  chosen  are  suitable  for\nachieving that aim\u2019 (para 51), citing Case C-167\/97  Seymour-Smith  [1999]  ECR  I-623,  [75]  &\n[76].\nComment\nIn practice, this means that before an employer can use the defence in reg 3 to a direct discrimination claim, the defence itself must\nbe justified by social policy aims in the national interest, not merely the employer\u2019s interest, although  of  course,  on  occasion  the\ntwo could coincide. The restriction to social policy aims places a question mark over the  recent  judgment  in  Seldon  v  Clarkson,\nWright & Jakes [2008]  UKEAT\/0063\/08,  (a  partnership  case  falling  outside  of  reg  30)  where  it  was  suggested  that  forced\nretirement could be justified under reg 3 by the partnership\u2019s aims of promoting a congenial culture in the workplace  (by  avoiding\nthe indignity of evaluating the performance of older  partners),  and  facilitating  the  expectations  of  junior  associates  to  achieve\npartnership.\nBack in the High Court, justifying reg 3 could prove problematic for two reasons. The ECJ\nindicated that in the absence of an expressed social aim, one could be inferred  from  the  \u2018context\u2019\nof reg 3. In its first consultation, the  Government  stated  it  would  include  a  general  defence  to\ndirect discrimination because inter alia it did not \u2018want to ban employment  practices  that  can  be\nreasonably and objectively justified. Businesses must be able  to  operate  productively\u2019  (Equality\nand  Diversity:  Age  Matters  Age  Consultation  2003  URN  03\/920  para  3.13).  In  the  second\nconsultation, it stated: \u2018A wide variety  of  aims  may  be  considered  as  legitimate.  ...  Economic\nfactors such as business needs  and  considerations  of  efficiency  may  also  be  legitimate  aims\u2019.\n(\u2018Equality and diversity: coming of age. Consultation  on  the  draft  Employment  Equality  (Age)\nRegulations 2006\u2019 (July 2005) DTI, URN 05\/1171, at para 4.1.16)\nThus, the first problem is that the Government considered a range of aims, at least some of\nwhich  are  \u2018purely  individual  reasons  particular  to  the  employer\u2019s  situation\u2019,  which   are   not\nlegitimate. From this context it can be seen that the Government did not consider that the  defence\nmust be related to a social policy aim (see e.g. ibid para 4.1.1).  The  reason  it  chose  this  general\ndefence was that in consultation  40%  of  employers  considered  a  prescriptive  list  of  aims  too\nrestrictive, hence its general nature, allowing \u2018a number of other potentially legitimate aims\u2019  (ibid\npara 4.1.3-4.1.4). The context also reveals that the  driving  force  behind  the  defence  was  not  a\nsocial policy, but rather the views of some employers, contributing to  the  individual  and  private\nnature of its aim.\nSecond, if one assumed that at  least  one  of  Government\u2019s  aims  could  be  considered  a\nsocial policy objective, it is difficult to see how such a general defence  could  be  appropriate  and\nnecessary. As it stands, employers could use it for  a  wide  range  of  \u2018purely  individual  reasons\u2019.\nThere exists,  as  the  Court  demanded,  less  discriminatory  alternatives,  such  as  more  specific\ndefences, more closely related to whatever social aim(s) the Government wishes to pursue; indeed\nsuch defences were enacted for other  aims,  such  as  the  national  minimum  wage  (reg  29)  and\npositive discrimination (reg 31).\n5. THE THIRD ISSUE - THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 6\nThe third issue for the Court  was  whether  Article  6(1)  presented  a  different  defence  from  the  standard  defence  of  objective\njustification for indirect discrimination afforded by Article 2(2)(b)(i). The Court held there was a difference  \u2018in  scope\u2019.  This  was\nbecause, it seems, unlike Article 6,  the  defence  in  Article  2  was  limited  to  indirect  discrimination  (paras  58-60).  The  Court\nconfirmed that the default retirement age could amount to direct discrimination (para 63), and  so  only  the  meaning  of  Article  6\nneeded consideration. It held that Article 6:\n...allows Member States to introduce into their national law measures providing for differences in  treatment  on  grounds\nof age which fall in particular within the category of direct discrimination as defined in Article 2(2)(a).\nBut this was \u2018strictly limited by the conditions laid down in Article 6(1) itself\u2019 (para 62).\nAge Concern argued that the phrase \u2018objectively and reasonably\u2019 adopted the language of the European Court of  Human\nRights, which required \u2018very weighty reasons\u2019 to justify discrimination under the European Convention on Human  Rights,  Article\n14.  (See   e.g.   Gaygusuz   v   Austria   [1996]   (1997)   23   EHRR   364   [42]   (nationality   discrimination);   Van   Raalte   v\nNetherlands (1997) 24 EHRR 503 [40] (sex discrimination)). Accordingly, Article 6 imposed \u2018a very high standard of scrutiny\u2019  in\nline with the ECtHR jurisprudence. The Court rejected this view, reasoning:\nit is inconceivable that a difference in treatment could  be  justified  by  a  legitimate  aim,  achieved  by  appropriate  and\nnecessary means, but that the justification would not be reasonable.\nAccordingly, \u2018no particular significance should be attached\u2019 to the addition of the word \u2018reasonably\u2019 (para 65). However, Article  6\nimposed on Member States \u2018notwithstanding their broad discretion in matters of social policy\u2019 a \u2018high standard of proof\u2019  regarding\nthe legitimacy of the aim relied upon (para 65). Whether this is \u2018higher\u2019 than the orthodox  test,  the  Court  did  not  say,  save  that\nwhere a measure (indirectly discriminating) could be justified under the orthodox test in Article  2(2)(b)(i),  there  was  no  need  to\nhave recourse Article 6 (para 66). This suggests that Article 6 imposes no higher burden  than  the  standard  formula  in  Article  2.\nFinally, the Court reiterated the standard formula that the measure must be in pursuit of a  legitimate  aim  -  \u2018such  as  employment\npolicy, or labour market or vocational  training  objectives\u2019  -  and  be  appropriate  and  necessary  to  achieve  the  aim  (para  67).\nAlthough the Court did not express it in terms, it is implicit from this and its  opinion  on  the  second  issue  (para  46),  that  under\nArticle 6(1), the legitimate aim is restricted to a social policy objective. Of course, this is another difference from Article 2(2)(b)(i),\nwhich permits employers to cite purely individual reasons to justify indirect discrimination.\nComment\nThis ruling was helpful so far as it confirmed that the default retirement age amounted - prime facie - to direct  discrimination,  and\ncould be justified only by social policy objectives under  Article  6.  It  was  less  helpful  on  the  meaning  of  this  justification.  It\nrepeated the standard formula for justifying a discriminatory social policy. The Member State had a \u2018broad discretion\u2019, but this was\nqualified with phrases such as \u2018a high standard  of  proof\u2019  and  that  exceptions  under  Article  6  were  \u2018strictly  limited\u2019,  and  the\nsuggestion that Article 6 imposed no higher standard of proof than Article 2.  The  resulting  ambiguity  permits  selective  quoting,\nand no doubt this will be a feature when the case returns to the UK for a decision on whether the default  retirement  age  is  indeed\nobjectively justified.\n                An example of selective quoting was apparent in an earlier reference, Seymour Smith (above), where  the  challenge  was\nto a reduction in unfair dismissal rights that adversely affected women. In its conclusion, the ECJ stated that a  measure  had  to  be\n\u2018suitable\u2019 to achieve the legitimate aim (para 77), although it had earlier stated it had to be \u2018suitable  and  necessary\u2019  (para  69).  In\nbetween, with a clear allusion to the Government\u2019s defence in that  particular  case  the  ECJ  observed  that  \u2018mere  generalisations\nconcerning the capacity of a ... measure to encourage recruitment are not enough ...  to  provide  evidence\u2019  to  justify  the  measure\n(para 76). Nonetheless, back in the UK, the House of Lords  ignored  the  last  two  passages,  quoting  only  the  first  to  support  a\nfinding that the test was no longer as stringent as previously thought, and as such the measure was justified despite a  total  absence\nof  evidence  from  the  Government  ([2000]  1  CMLR   770   [62]   Lord   Nicholls).   Unlike   in   Seymour-Smith,   the   ECJ   in\nHeyday  ventured  no  opinion  on  the  lawfulness  of  the  measure,  and  so  its  judgment  is  even  more  vulnerable  to  selective\ninterpretation.\n6. BACK TO THE HIGH COURT - THE DEFAULT RETIREMENT AGE\nThe headline question in this case is whether the UK\u2019s default retirement age is lawful. The  ECJ  \u2018deliberately\u2019  was  not  asked  to\ndecide that matter, and indeed had no evidence upon which to offer an opinion (see A-G Maz\u00e1k\u2019s Opinion, para 21). However,  the\njudgment confirmed (the first issue) that retirement exemptions fall within the scope of the Directive, and so the default  retirement\nage must be justified under Article 6(1). On the meaning of Article 6, the Court confirmed that the legitimate aim must be  a  social\npolicy objective, but beyond that it merely repeated - more or less - the standard  formula  for  objective  justification.  And  so  this\nreference has provided only limited assistance to the High Court on the lawfulness of the default retirement age.\nPrevious ECJ case law may provide a little more assistance. The Court has ruled on the lawfulness of  a  state  exemption\nfrom the age discrimination principle on two occasions. In Case  C-144\/04  Mangold  v  Helm  [2006]  1  CMLR  43,  German  law\nexempted from regulation fixed-term employment contracts for any worker over 52. This relaxation  of  protective  legislation  was\ndesigned to encourage employers to recruit older workers. Its aim was to help older persons find jobs more  easily.  Of  course,  the\nmore direct result of this measure  was  to  remove  safeguards  for  older  workers,  who  could  now  be  employed  on  temporary\ncontracts for the rest of their working lives. The ECJ observed: \u2018This significant body of workers, determined solely on the basis of\nage, is thus in danger,  during  a  substantial  part  of  its  members\u2019  working  life,  of  being  excluded  from  the  benefit  of  stable\nemployment\u2019 (para 64)  and held that the policy could not be objectively justified because  it  went  beyond  what  was  appropriate\nand necessary to help unemployed older workers.\nIn Palacios de la Villa (above), a worker challenged a Spanish measure permitting compulsory  retirement  ages  to  be\nnegotiated in collective agreements. The Court found that the aim of \u2018checking  unemployment\u2019  was  a  legitimate  one  (para  62).\nThis was generous because this measure could only redistribute unemployment from the young to the old. On  proportionality,  the\nCourt stated (para 72):\nIt does not appear unreasonable for ... a Member State to take the view  that  a  measure  ...\nmay be appropriate and necessary in order to achieve ... the promotion of full  employment\nby facilitating access to the labour market.\nFurther, the measure did not \u2018unduly prejudice\u2019  workers  of  retirement  age  because  compulsory\nretirement was subject to  a  worker  being  entitled  to  a  \u2018not  unreasonable\u2019  retirement  pension.\n\u2018Moreover\u2019, it enabled trade  unions  and  employers\u2019  organisations  to  agree  \u2018with  considerable\nflexibility\u2019 a compulsory retirement mechanism that took account of the labour market concerned,\nand the specific features of the jobs in question (paras 73-74). Thus, the measure was justified. The generous  view\nof the social aim, and the deferral to what the Member State considered reasonable, indicates that, in contrast to Mangold, this  was\na liberal approach.\nThese  cases  appear  to  represent  two  approaches  to  justifying  age  discrimination:  one  strict  and  one  liberal.   The\nHeyday judgment does little to indicate which approach should prevail. Its references to  a  \u2018high  standard  of  proof\u2019  and  \u2018strictly\nlimited\u2019 could be cited in favour of the strict approach. However, future courts could just as easily  point  to  the  \u2018broad  margin  of\ndiscretion\u2019 repeated in Heyday, and afforded in Palacios de la Villa.\nHowever, Mangold and Palacios de la Villa are reconcilable on one issue at least.  Unlike  in  Mangold,  the  measure  in\nPalacios de la Villa was passed with the instigation and\/or cooperation of trade  unions  and  employers\u2019  groups,  and  this  clearly\ninfluenced the Court (paras 53, 60, & 74). Similarly, in the United States the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act  1967\n(ADEA) permits workers to \u2018waive\u2019 their rights, but only, especially for retirement, according to  conditions  that  must  be  strictly\nobserved: see e.g. Oubre v Entergy Operations 522 US 422 (Sup Ct 1998). Article 6 similarly signals that the law is  more  tolerant\nof age discrimination. Precise expressions of this tolerance are provided by the ADEA\u2019s waiver provision  and  the  Palicios  de  la\nVilla judgment. By contrast, the law would  be  highly  intolerant  of  an  agreement  to  dismiss  a  worker  on  racial  grounds,  for\ninstance, an employer paying off a hairdresser because his customers \u2018prefer white girls\u2019. Although it appears a universal  principle\nthat age discrimination is less pernicious, the law\u2019s tolerance - so far - is limited to cases with an element of consent  (see  also,  for\nCanada, McKinney v University of Guelph [1990] 3 SCR  229).  The  default  retirement  age  is  a  significant  step  outside  of  the\ntolerance to age discrimination shown in Palicios de la Villa and the long-established ADEA 1967.\nOf course, the Government will invoke Palacios de la Villa on the ground that it is  a  \u2018retirement\u2019  case  and  so  appears\nfactually closer to Heyday than Mangold. However, Palacios de la  Villa  is  distinguishable.  Consent  is  conspicuously  absent  in\nHeyday. Further, the Spanish exemption was subject to the worker\u2019s pension qualification. By contrast, the  UK  exemption  allows\nall employers to compel its workers to retire, without consideration of the worker\u2019s pension qualifications; and without any level of\nworker-agreement whatsoever. It facilitates even \u2018age-hostile\u2019 dismissals, so long as they are labelled \u2018retirement\u2019.\nIn its second consultation, the Government stated that the default retirement age was made with two  social  policy  aims:\nemployers\u2019 workforce planning and the stability of occupational pension schemes and other work-related  benefits.  (\u2018Equality  and\ndiversity: coming  of  age.  Consultation  on  the  draft  Employment  Equality  (Age)  Regulations  2006\u2019  (July  2005)  DTI,  URN\n05\/1171, para 6.1.15.) It  is  questionable  whether  these  aims  qualify  as  a  social  policy,  because  they  are  to  help  individual\nemployers and their benefit schemes. However, it is arguable that a compulsory retirement age has a broader societal  impact,  such\nas  a  motivation   for   workers   to   save   pre-retirement,   and   a   reduction   in   \u2018job-blocking\u2019   (\u2018Notes   on   the   Regulations\u2019\n(http:\/\/www.berr.gov.uk\/files\/file27136.pdf), para 100.) Given the ECJ\u2019s deference to member states\u2019 autonomy in  social  matters,\nit may well be that these relatively minor factors qualify the policy as a legitimate aim.\nOn  the  issue  of  proportionality,  the  UK  Government  maintained  that  a   \u2018significant\u2019\nnumber of employers use a set retirement age as a necessary part of their workforce planning.  But\nthe  exemption  covers  all  employers,  not  just  this  \u2018significant\u2019  number.  Second,  the  Government  claimed  that  its\nconsultation showed that without a default retirement age there was risk to the  stability  of  pensions.  No  supporting  evidence  or\nextended       reasons       were       given       (see        e.g.        the        Government\u2019s        Regulatory        Impact        Assessments:\nhttp:\/\/www.berr.gov.uk\/files\/file35877.pdf). On the face of it, pension schemes should not suffer if workers carry on  working  and\neither draw their pensions, or defer entitlement and continue to contribute to the scheme. This is especially so with the increasingly\ncommon \u2018defined contribution\u2019 schemes, where the payout is governed by the size of the fund, rather than external factors, such  as\nthe final salary used for \u2018defined benefit\u2019 schemes. Further, at a time of a \u2018pensions crisis\u2019, caused by the  ever-growing  proportion\nof retired persons, forced retirement does not appear an appropriate way to achieve general pension stability. Of  course,  situations\nmay arise where forced retirement becomes a necessary consequence of preserving the pension scheme, say  where  a  restructuring\nmay  compel  workers  to  retire  to  qualify  for  the  more  generous  old  scheme  (see  e.g.   Bloxham   v   Freshfields   Bruckhaus\nDeringer [2007] Pens LR 375 (ET)). But these are isolated cases, requiring specific justification. As with the \u2018workforce  planning\u2019\nargument, the exemption goes far beyond what is necessary to address these situations. Further, it  appears  to  be  no  more  than  a\n\u2018mere generalisation\u2019 considered inadequate by the ECJ in Seymour-Smith and Heyday.\n5. CONCLUSION\nFor those approaching an unwanted retirement, and those with cases pending the outcome of the  Heyday  litigation,  the  judgment\nmay appear to be of marginal importance. However, one significant pronouncement was the  restriction  of  any  legitimate  aim  to\nsocial policy objectives. In the context of reg 3, the Government,  and  the  EAT  in  Seldon  v  Clarkson,  seemed  unaware  of  this\nrestriction. Otherwise, the judgment is of limited importance. This was not the fault of the ECJ, which was confined to  the  limited\nquestions supplied by the High Court.\nThe judgment confirms that the Directive applies to the \u2018retirement\u2019  exemptions  (regs  30  and  7(4))  and  the  objective\njustification defence (reg 3), a point already established in Palacios de la Villa. It stated  that  these  regulations  are  permissible  if\nthey can be objectively justified according - more or less \u2013 to the orthodox criteria usually afforded to social policy  measures.  But\nthere were ambiguities in the guidance to both issues. For instance, for the objective justification defence  to  direct  discrimination,\nthe defence had to be \u2018sufficiently precise and clear\u2019 for persons to  \u2018ascertain  the  full  extent  of  their  rights\u2019  and  yet  a  general\ndefence may \u2018satisfy\u2019 these conditions. Justification of the default retirement age under  Article  6  does  not  involve  a  \u2018very  high\nstandard of scrutiny\u2019, but it will have to be to a \u2018high standard of proof\u2019, yet apparently  no  higher  than  the  orthodox  test;  at  the\nsame time we were reminded of a State\u2019s \u2018broad margin of discretion\u2019 in such matters. This guidance is so  vulnerable  to  selective\nquoting, that the outcome, as shown by the Seymour-Smith saga, remains unpredictable.\nMichael Connolly\nUniversity of Surrey\n"}
