The SatNEx project,\nwhich began in 2004, is funded for five years under the Euro-\npean Union\u2019s Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) Informa-\ntion Society Technologies (IST) Thematic Area. Led by the\nGerman Aerospace Center, SatNEx brings together a network\nof 24 partners, distributed throughout Europe, with mem-\nbership drawn from ten countries.\nThe philosophy underlying the SatNEx approach re-\nvolves around the selection of focused actions under Joint\nProgrammes of Activities, which are carried out collectively\nby the partners and include research, integration, and dis-\nsemination activities. Training represents an important part\nof the SatNEx remit and is supported through a number of\ninitiatives including the hosting of internship projects and an\nannual summer school.\nThe call for papers resulted in a high number of submis-\nsions, from which we have been able to select 12 excellent\npapers dealing with the di\ufb00erent aspects of satellite commu-\nnications and navigation.\nMultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques are\nattracting a considerable amount of attention from within\nthe terrestrial wireless community. The first paper of this spe-\ncial issue, \u201cMultisatellite MIMO communications at Ku band\nand above: investigations on spatial multiplexing for capac-\nity improvement and selection diversity for interference mit-\nigation,\u201d considers the application of such technology over a\nsatellite platform operating in the Ku band and above. The\npaper considers how MIMO can be used to increase capac-\nity by using a satellite spatial multiplexing system and how\nantenna selection can be used to mitigate interference. The\nnext paper \u201cInvestigations in satellite MIMO channel model-\ning: accent on polarization\u201d looks at MIMO systems from the\npolarization diversity point of view and dwells on the satellite\ncooperative communication concepts.\nSwitch and stay combining (SSC) is a form of diversity\ntechnique used in digital receivers to compensate for fade\nevents introduced by the mobile channel. The third paper\n\u201cPerformance analysis of SSC diversity receivers over corre-\nlated Ricean fading satellite channels\u201d investigates the per-\nformance of dual-branch SSC receivers for di\ufb00erent fading\nchannel characteristics.\nThe next four papers deal with the emerging scenario\nof mobile digital video broadcasting (DVB-S2 and RCS mo-\nbile). Alternative approaches to counteracting fading chan-\nnels introduced when operating in a train environment re-\nceiving satellite DVB-S2 are presented in the paper \u201cAd-\nvanced fade countermeasures for DVB-S2 systems in railway\nscenarios.\u201d Here, as a result of simulation analysis, antenna\ndiversity and packet-level forward error correction mecha-\nnisms are proposed and their impact is evaluated with respect\nto the receiver design and system complexity. The theme of\nDVB-S2 is continued with the paper \u201cCapacity versus bit er-\nror rate trade-o\ufb00 in the DVB-S2 forward link,\u201d which inves-\ntigates how satellite capacity can be optimised for DVB-S2\ntransmissions. The DVB return channel via satellite (DVB-\nRCS) is then addressed in \u201cFrequency estimation in iterative\ninterference cancellation applied to multibeam satellite sys-\ntems,\u201d which considers the application of interference cancel-\nlation on the reverse link of a multibeam satellite system, us-\ning DVB-RCS with convolutional coding as an example. The\npaper \u201cA QoS architecture for DVB-RCS next-generation\nsatellite networks\u201d proceeds to design and emulate a quality-\nof-service (QoS) architecture that demonstrates using real\nmultimedia applications how QoS can be supported over a\nDVB-RCS network.\n2 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\nSynchronization aspects are dealt with in \u201cMaximum\nlikelihood timing and carrier synchronization in burst-mode\nsatellite transmissions.\u201d The paper addresses the problem of\nachieving synchronisation for a burst-mode satellite trans-\nmission over an AWGN channel. The subject of burst trans-\nmission continues with the paper \u201cBurst format design for\noptimum joint estimation of Doppler-shift and Doppler-\nrate in packet satellite communications,\u201d which considers\noptimising the burst-format of packet-oriented transmis-\nsions by proposing very-low-complexity algorithms for car-\nrier Doppler-shift and Doppler-rate estimation.\nA network comprising satellite and high-altitude plat-\nforms is considered in the paper \u201cTCP-call admission con-\ntrol interaction in multiplatform space architectures.\u201d Cross-\nlayer techniques are implemented by means of TCP feeding\nback into call admission control (CAC) procedures for the\npurpose of prevention of congestion and improvement in\nQoS.\nFinally, since navigation is an extremely important part\nof the satellite system family, we have included two papers.\nThe first paper \u201cE\ufb03cient delay tracking methods with side-\nlobes cancellation for BOC-modulated signals\u201d deals with bi-\nnary o\ufb00set carrier (BOC) modulation, which is adopted in\ntypical navigation systems. The paper considers how to im-\nprove the tracking of the main lobe of the BOC-modulated\nsignal by using sidelobe suppression techniques. An alterna-\ntive approach based on filter bank processing is presented in\n\u201cAnalysis of filter-bank-based methods for fast serial acqui-\nsition of BOC-modulated signals\u201d to conclude the special is-\nsue.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt has been a pleasure for us to have put together this spe-\ncial issue, which we hope you will find interesting.

Sheri\ufb00\nAnton Donner\nAlessandro Vanelli-Coralli\nEURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\nSpecial Issue on\nSignal Processing-Assisted Protocols and Algorithms for\nCooperating Objects andWireless Sensor Networks\nCall for Papers\nWith the advent of the so-called Internet of Things (IoTs),\nwe will witness an unprecedented growth in the num-\nber of networked terminals and devices. In attaining this\nIoT vision, a class of energy- and, in general, resource-\nconstrained systems like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nnetworks of cooperating objects and embedded devices\nsuch as RFIDs, or networks for Device-to-Device (D2D)\nand Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are to\nplay a fundamental role. The paradigm shift from general-\npurpose data networks to application-oriented networks\n(e.g., for parameter or random field estimation, event\ndetection, localization, and tracking) clearly calls for further\noptimization at the physical, link, and network layers of\nthe protocol stack. Interestingly, the above-mentioned esti-\nmation\/detection\/localization\/tracking problems have been\naddressed for years by the signal processing community,\nthis resulting into a number of well-known algorithms.\nBesides, some inspiration could be also borrowed from\nother communication schemes, such as MIMO and beam-\nforming techniques or cooperative communications that\nwere traditionally developed for wireless data networks, or\neven from other fields such as mathematical biology (e.g.,\nnetworks of coupled oscillators). However, the challenge\nnow is to enhance such algorithms and schemes and make\nthem suitable for decentralized and resource-constrained\noperation in networks with a potentially high number\nof nodes. Complementarily, the vast literature produced\nby the information theory community, on the one hand,\nreveals the theoretical performance limits of decentralized\nprocessing (e.g., distributed source coding) and, on the\nother, o\ufb00ers insight on the scalability properties of such\nlarge networks and their behavior in the asymptotic regime.\nRealizing the information-theoretic performance with prac-\ntical decentralized networking, radio resource management\nschemes, routing protocols, and other network management\nparadigms is a key challenge.\nThe objective of this Special Issue (whose preparation\nis carried out under the auspices of the EC Network\nof Excellence in Wireless Communications NEWCOM++)\nis to gather recent advances in the areas of cooperating\nobjects, embedded devices, and wireless sensor networks.\nThe focus is on how the design of future physical, link,\nand network layers could benefit from a signal processing-\noriented approach.

They are\nestablished and used in science in the past 40 years. The\nprinciples of robust statistics have found fruitful applications\nin numerous signal processing disciplines especially in digital\nimage processing and signal processing for communications.\nMedian, myriad, meridian, L filters (with their modifica-\ntions), and signal-adaptive realizations form a powerful tool-\nbox for diverse applications. All of these filters have lowpass\ncharacteristic. This characteristic limits their application in\nanalysis of diverse nonstationary signals where impulse,\nheavy-tailed, or other forms of the non-Gaussian noise can\nappear: FM, radar and speech signal processing, and so\nforth. Recent research activities and studies have shown\nthat combination of nonstationary signals and non-Gaussian\nnoise can be observed in some novel emerging applications\nsuch as internet tra\ufb03c monitoring and digital video coding.\nSeveral techniques have been recently proposed for han-\ndling the signal filtering, parametric\/nonparametric estima-\ntion, feature extraction of nonstationary and signals with\nhigh-frequency content corrupted by non-Gaussian noise.\nOne approach is based on filtering in the time-domain. Here,\nthe standard median\/myriad forms are modified in such a\nmanner to allow negative- and complex-valued weights. This\ngroup of techniques is able to produce all filtering character-\nistics: highpass, stopband, and bandpass. As an alternative,\nthe robust filtering techniques are proposed in spectral\n(frequency- Fourier, DCT, wavelet, or in the time-frequency)\ndomain. The idea is to determine robust transforms having\nthe ability to eliminate or surpass influence of non-Gaussian\nnoise. Then filtering, parameter estimation, and\/or feature\nextraction is performed using the standard means. Other\nalternatives are based on the standard approaches (optimiza-\ntion, iterative, ML strategies) modified for nonstationary\nsignals or signals with high-frequency content.\nSince these techniques are increasingly popular, the goal\nof this special issue is to review and compare them, propose\nnew techniques, study novel application fields, and consider\ntheir implementations.\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Robust statistical signal processing (estimation, detec-\ntion, decisions)\n\u2022 Robust tracking, classification and control\n\u2022 Performance analysis, comparison, benchmark set-\nting, and achievable bounds\n\u2022 Robust parametric\/non-parametric estimation, filter-\ning, and feature extraction of nonstationary signals\n\u2022 Robust learning and adaptive robust techniques\n\u2022 Fast software and hardware realizations\n\u2022 Applications\nBefore submission authors should carefully read over the\njournal\u2019s Author Guidelines, which are located at http:\/\/www\n.hindawi.com\/journals\/asp\/guidelines.html.
