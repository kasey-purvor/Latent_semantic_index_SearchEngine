Current\nsampling collection protocols for mycotoxins have been designed to estimate the mean\nconcentration and fail to characterise the spatial distribution of the mycotoxin concentration\ndue to the aggregation of the incremental samples. Geostatistical techniques have been\nsuccessfully applied to overcome similar problems in many research areas. However, little\nwork has been developed on the use of geostatistics for the design of sampling protocols for\nmycotoxins. This paper focuses on the analysis of the two and three-dimensional spatial\nstructure of fumonisins B1 (FB1) and B2 (FB2) in maize in a bulk store using a geostatistical\napproach and on how results inform on determining the number and location of incremental\nsamples to be collected. The spatial correlation between FB1 and FB2, as well as between the\nnumber of kernels infected and the level of contamination was investigated. For this purpose,\na bed of maize was sampled at different depths to generate a unique three-dimensional data\nset of FB1 and FB2. The analysis found no clear evidence of spatial structure in either the\ntwo-dimensional or three-dimensional analyses. The number of Fusarium infected kernels\nwas not a good indicator for the prediction of fumonisin concentration and there was no\nspatial correlation between the concentrations of the two fumonisins.\nKeywords\ncereals, fungi, Fusarium, mycotoxins, distribution\nJournal World Mycotoxin Journal\nPublisher Wageningen Academic Publishers\nISSN 1875-0710 (Print) 1875-0796 (Online)\nIssue Volume 3, Number 1 \/ February 2010\nDOI 10.3920\/WMJ2009.1178\nPages 95-103\nOnline Date Tuesday, February 09, 2010\nIntroduction\nTo reduce consumer exposure to mycotoxins it is critical to design sampling protocols that\nensure representative samples for analysis. Regulations on how to sample for target\nmycotoxins and which levels are acceptable for consumption have already been established\n(European Commission, 2006a, 2006b, 2007). The proposed sampling requires the collection\nof several incremental samples (i.e. small quantities of the commodity) at different locations.\nThese are mixed to form the aggregate sample. If this is large, it is mixed and subsampled to\nform the laboratory sample for analysis, otherwise the full aggregate sample is used.\nHowever, this type of sampling is intended only to estimate the mean concentration and is\nunable to characterise the variability or the spatial distribution due to the aggregation of the\nincrements.\nThe heterogeneous distribution of mycotoxins in space has been recognised to be one of the\nmain limitations for the design of effective sampling protocols (Stroka et al., 2004, Schatzki,\n1995a and 1995b, Jewers et al., 1988 and Battilani et al., 2006). Several studies have looked\ninto this limitation in more detail. For example: Johansson et al. (2006) looked at the spatial\ndistribution of fumonisin and aflatoxin concentration in maize; Whitaker (2003) investigated\nthe sources of error in the mycotoxin test procedure for aflatoxin in raw shelled peanuts;\nCoker et al. (1995) reviewed the complexities associated with the design of sampling plans;\nMaanen and Xu (2003) identified the difficulties of sampling the spatial aggregation of plant\ndisease; Macarthur et al. (2006) identified the need to account for the spatial heterogeneity of\nmycotoxins to design adequate sampling programmes; and Whitaker (2006) identified the\nneed for methods that focus on defining the number of samples required to obtain a specific\nlevel of confidence on the mean mycotoxin concentration and on determining the location of\nthe samples to be taken.\nThere has been some interest in characterising the two-dimensional spatial heterogeneity of\nmycotoxins to determine the number and location of incremental samples in sampling\nprotocols. For example, Rivas et al. (2009a and 2009b) used geostatistics to model the two-\ndimensional spatial structure of ochratoxin A (OTA) and deoxynivalenol (DON) in bulk\ncommodities and Rekah et al. (1999) used it for Fusarium crown and root rot in tomatoes.\nHowever, there has been much less effort on the design of sample collection protocols that\naccount for their three-dimensional spatial heterogeneity. Johansson et al. (2006) looked at\nthe three-dimensional distribution of fumonisin and aflatoxin in maize commodities by\ninvestigating the contamination levels in damaged kernels, whole kernels and other materials\n(i.e. broken and foreign material). They found that toxins were concentrated in the poor\nquality components within stores of maize. These correspond to the smaller size particles and\ngenerally deposit at the bottom of the commodity. However, the study did not statistically\nquantify the three-dimensional spatial heterogeneity. This could be achieved applying\ngeostatistics. Three-dimensional geostatistics has been successfully applied to reconstruct the\nlarge to intermediate heterogeneity of aquifers (Falivene et al., 2007), to reproduce the spatial\nvariability of rock mass quality for geological excavations (Stavropoulou et al., 2007) and to\nmap three-dimensional water-quality data to better protect the future health of the\nChesapeake Bay and its tidal tributary system (Chehata et al., 2007).\nGeostatistics can also be used to investigate the spatial autocorrelation between variables.\nThe high cost associated to sample collection and analysis usually results in a reduced\nnumber of incremental samples being taken from a commodity. This has an impact on the\naccuracy of the estimated mean concentration. Further understanding of the spatial\ncorrelation between variables will inform on how the mycotoxin concentration can be\nestimated using variables that are less costly and time consuming. For example, the number\nof kernels infected could be used for this purpose. Reid et al. (1996) looked at the correlation\nbetween the mean disease severity rating and the percentage of symptomatic kernels for\nFusarium graminearum inoculated maize ears. Results showed that there was a positive\nassociation between the two variables. Desjardins et al. (1998) found that the highest levels\nof Fusarium moniliforme were in the symptomatic kernels. Uhlig et al. (2004) looked at the\nrelationship between the number of kernels infected with Fusaria and the moniliformin fungal\nmethabolite in Norwegian grain samples of oats, barley and wheat. However, none of these\nstudies have looked at how spatial statistical analysis could improve the understanding of the\ncorrelation between variables.\nThis paper focuses on the analysis of the two and three-dimensional spatial structure of FB1\nand FB2 in stored maize using a geostatistical approach. The spatial correlation between FB1\nand FB2, as well as between the number of kernels infected and the level of contamination\nwere also characterised using geostatistical techniques. For this purpose, a bed of maize was\nsampled at different depths to generate a unique three-dimensional data set of FB1 and FB2.\nThis is the first study that tries to quantify the three-dimensional spatial structure of\nmycotoxins post-harvest. The analysis investigated the following hypotheses:\n\uf0b7 The fumonisin concentrations have spatial structures that can be quantified using\ngeostatistics.\n\uf0b7 The concentration of fumonisin is related to the number of infected kernels\n\uf0b7 The concentration of fumonisins B1 and B2 are spatially correlated.\nMaterials and Methods\nData collection\nData were collected from a bed of maize in a large store with an area of approximately\n3800 m2 and a height of approximately 10 m. The kernels, which came from several fields,\nwere stored against the walls, leaving the central space clear. The samples were taken in three\nplanar layers inclined at 45\u00b0, parallel to the open face of the bed, providing a three-\ndimensional grid of points with 10 (horizontal) by 5 (vertical) points in each layer at 0.5 m\nspacing (Figure 1). The samples were taken using a specially designed probe which was\ninserted horizontally through the face. The probe had a conical chamber at the tip that could\nbe opened and closed using a lever at the end of the shaft (Figure 2), collecting about 200 g of\ngrain. A metal frame 0.5 m square was placed on the face and used to locate the insertion\npoints, and the three samples from different layers at each point were taken before moving\nthe frame to minimise disturbance of the grain.\nFusarium isolation and analyses of fumonisins\nThe percentage of kernels infected by Fusarium section Liseola was also determined. Fifty\nkernels were randomly selected from each sample, surface disinfected with a solution of 1%\nsodium hypochlorite and 90% ethyl alcohol for 2 min and rinsed with sterile distilled water.\nThe kernels were plated in Petri dishes on Potato Dextrose Agar containing streptomycin\n(PDA: potato broth 600 g, sucrose 10 g, agar 15 g, water to 1 L) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7\ndays. Colonies which resembled Fusaria, were transferred to new Petri dishes of the same\nmedium, incubated for 7-14 days and identified according to Burgess (1994). The number of\nkernels with Fusarium verticillioides and F.proliferatum were counted.\nFumonisin analyses\nThe FB1 and FB2 contents were analyzed according to the method proposed by Visconti et al.\n(2001), with some modifications. After grinding the entire sample to pass a 1 mm sieve and\nhomogenization, fumonisins were extracted from 20 g of meal in a plastic centrifuge bottle\nwith 100 ml of acetonitrile:methanol:water (25:25:50, v\/v\/v). After extraction for 45 min\nusing a rotary-shaking stirrer and centrifugation at 4500 x g for 6 min, the supernatant was\npoured into a flask; another 100 ml of the same solution was added to the residue in the\ncentrifuge bottle, and a second extraction performed for 30 min. The combined extracts were\nfiltered through a folded filter-paper. An aliquot of 2 ml was diluted with 20 ml of 0.1 M\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and purified through an immunoaffinity column (R-\nBiopharm Rh\u00f4ne Ltd., Glasgow, Scotland, UK); after washing the column with PBS (2 ml),\nthe fumonisins were slowly eluted (0.5 ml min-1) with methanol (6 ml) into a graduated glass\nvial; subsequently, the eluate was concentrated to 2 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen.\nAnalysis was carried out using a LC\u2013MS\/MS system, (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose,\nCA, USA), as previously described (Battilani et al., 2008). The limit of detection (LOD,\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 3:1) and of quantification (LOQ, signal-to-noise ratio of 10:1) were\nrespectively 10 and 30 \u00b5g kg-1. Recovery percentages were evaluated by spiking known\nblank samples. Average recovery values were: 95.5\u00b11.9% for FB1 and 93.6\u00b12.1% for FB2.\nThe results of the analyses were not corrected for recovery.\nFive primary samples, with different fumonisin levels, were re-analyzed two more times to\nestimate the precision of the analysis, which proved the differences between measurements\non the same sample to be smaller than 5%.\nData analysis\nTwo dimensional geostatistical analysis was conducted to investigate the spatial structure\nwithin each layer. Geostatistical analysis is based on the semi-variogram, a plot that relates\nthe distance between any two points with the semi-variance (Figure 3). The semi-variance is\na measure of the similarity between any two points; the closer two points are the smaller their\nsemi-variance and the larger their spatial autocorrelation. The semi-variance is calculated as\nfollows:\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\n)(\n1\n2))()((\n)(2\n1)(\u02c6\nhm\ni\nii hxzxzhm\nh\uf067 (1)\nwhere z(xi) is the value of variable z at location xi, m(h) is the number of pairs of data points\nseparated by distance h and \uf067(h) is the average semi-variance of all pairs of data points\nseparated by distance h, which is known as the lag distance or lag. The semi-variance for a\ngiven lag distance is estimated by using all the points separated by distances within a certain\ntolerance of the required lag distance. The resulting interval is called the lag tolerance. The\ngraph of semi-variance against lag distance is the experimental semi-variogram. The model\nfitted to the experimental semi-variogram is the empirical semi-variogram.\nThe empirical semi-variogram is described using three parameters: the sill, the range and the\nnugget (Figure 3). The sill is the a priori variance, \uf0732, of the process and is generally\nassumed to be equal to the variance of the population (Barnes, 1991). The range is the\ndistance at which pairs of points are spatially independent and lack autocorrelation. The\nnugget is the semi-variance at a lag distance of 0, and identifies the measurement error and\nthe variations that occur over lag distances less than the shortest sampling interval (Webster\nand Oliver, 2000).\nGeostatistical analysis is more effective when the variable has a normal (Gaussian)\ndistribution and does not present any trend. Values of skewness and kurtosis were calculated\nto test for normality. Where the test failed a Box-Cox transformation (Equation 2) was\napplied:\n\u03bbXX\u03c4 \u03bb \/)1()( \uf02d\uf03d (2)\nwhere X is the variable to be transformed, \uf074(X) is the Box-Cox transformed variable and the\nparameter \u03bb is a constant derived iteratively from the data. Regression analysis was used to \ntest for linear or quadratic trends in the X and Y directions (Figure 1). Data were assumed to\nhave trend when the variance accounted for by the fitted model was larger than 20%.\nFor each layer, the experimental semi-variograms were derived in the X and Y directions to\ntest for differences in the spatial pattern. It was found that there were insufficient points in the\nY direction to give a reliable semi-variogram, so the data were assumed to be isotropic (no\nchange in the semi-variogram parameters due to direction) and the averaged semi-variogram\nfor all the directions, also known as the omnidirectional semi-variogram, was calculated. The\nmaximum distance for the semi-variogram calculation was set to 2.5 m, because this was the\npoint at which the number of pairs of data points started to decrease. The lag tolerance was\nset to 0.1 m, because larger values did not provide enough points to fit the semi-variogram\nmodel.\nThe three-dimensional spatial structure was characterised using a three-dimensional semi-\nvariogram calculated from the combined data set. The three-dimensional semi-variogram was\ncalculated for FB1 and FB2 for the same values of maximum distance and lag tolerance used\nin the two-dimensional semi-variogram calculations. The spherical (Equation 3) and\nexponential (Equation 4) empirical semi-variogram models were fitted using least squares:\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03e\uf02b\n\uf0a3\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\nahcc\nah\na\nh\na\nhcch\nfor\nfor\n2\n1\n2\n3\n)(\u02c6\n0\n3\n0\uf067 (3)\n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03e\uf02b\n\uf0a3\uf02d\uf02b\n\uf03d\nahrc\nahrhcc\nh\nfor\nfor\/exp1\n)(\u02c6\n0\n0\uf067 (4)\nwhere co is the nugget, c is the sill, a is the range, r is the effective range and h is the lag\ndistance. The exponential model approaches its sill asymptotically and therefore, does not\nhave a finite range. The effective range r is calculated instead and is assumed to be\napproximately 3a. The model with the best fit was selected.\nCross-variograms were used to investigate whether the number of kernels infected was\nrelated to the concentration of the fumonisins within each layer and for the full data set. The\ncross-variogram provided information on their spatial correlation. The cross-variogram, that\nis the plot of semi-variance between two variables against lag distance, )(h\uf047 is calculated as\nfollows (Nielsen and Wendroth, 2003).\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf047\n)(\n1\n)]()()][()([\n)(2\n1)(\nhN\ni\niiiiiiii hxBxBhxAxAhN\nh (5)\nwhere h is the distance between sampling locations, A and B are two variables and N is the\ntotal number of measurements taken. The cross-variogram was also calculated to assess the\nspatial correlation of fumonisin B1 with B2. Positive cross-variogram values indicate that the\ntwo variables vary jointly in space, negative values show variables that vary in opposite\nspatial directions and null cross-variogram represent variables that vary independently in\nspace (Nielsen and Wendroth, 2003).\nResults\nThe FB1 and FB2 data sets did not follow Normal distributions. Box-Cox transformations\nwith \u03bb value equal to 0.219273 for FB1 and 0.089097 for FB2 were carried out. This\nguaranteed the Normality of the data in each layer and in whole data set. Table 1 summarises\nthe descriptive statistics for the raw data set and the results for the Box-Cox transformed data\nare in Table 2. The trend model accounted for less than 20% of the variance so the data sets\nwere not de-trended. The infected kernel count data was log transformed to meet the\nnormality requirement.\nSimilar patterns were evident for FB1 and FB2 within each layer, with the peak concentrations\noccurring at the same locations (Figure 4). However, there was no obvious correspondence\nbetween the patterns in different layers. There was insufficient information to conclude\nwhether there was a trend with distance into the bed.\nFor each layer the concentration of FB1 was larger than FB2. Layer 1 showed the largest\nmean and maximum contamination levels for both FB1 and FB2, followed by layer 2 and\nlayer 3 and the ratio FB2\/FB1 was 0.78, 0.70 and 0.57, respectively. Both skewness and\nkurtosis excess were close to 0 after the transformation (Table 2). A better approximation to\nNormality could have been obtained by removing the extreme values, but this would have\nchanged the spatial structure by removing the peak values, so no outliers or extreme values\nwere removed.\nTable 1.

Layer 1 showed\nthe smallest semi-variance values, followed by layer 2 and 3. This is consistent with the\nstandard deviation values shown in Table 2. The increase in semi-variance values was more\nobvious for FB1 than FB2.\nThe results for the three-dimensional analysis showed that the semi-variance values increased\nwith distance for both fumonisins (Figure 6). This pattern was clearer for FB1. The\nexponential model provided a better fit for the experimental semi-variogram of FB1 whilst the\nspherical was a better fit for FB2. The semi-variogram for FB1 showed a range of 1.83 m, a\nsill of 24.23 and a nugget of 17.18. FB2 had a range of 0.62 m, a sill of 2.71 and 0 nugget.\nThe spatial autocorrelation was lost at closer distances for FB1 than for FB2.\nThe cross-variograms were pure nugget: none of the cross-variograms showed any significant\nspatial autocorrelation between the variables (Figures 7 and 8). This indicates that there is no\nspatial correlation between the two fumonisins or between the number of infected kernels and\nthe fumonisin concentration.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the geostatistical analysis showed no evidence of spatial structure for\nfumonisins in two dimensions. This contrasts with Rivas et al. (2009a and 2009b) where\nDON in wheat, which is also produced by Fusarium spp. (F.culmorum, F.graminearum)\npresented spatial structure. There was some evidence of structure in the three dimensional\nsemi-variogram for FB1.\nThe random spatial pattern may be due to the nature of the mycotoxin, the way the grain was\nmixed and stored, the presence of spatial structure at a finer or coarser scale than the\nsampling grid or due to insufficient data points. There were only 50 points in each layer,\nwhereas 100 are usually required (Webster and Oliver, 2000). The three-dimensional\nvariogram contained 150 points, which may explain the appearance of some structure, but\nwas limited by containing only three points in the third axis. If there is spatial structure at a\nfiner scale than the sampling grid, it implies that practical sampling, which would normally\nbe at a coarser scale, could treat the distribution as random.\nFumonisins B1 and B2 showed similar distribution patterns within each layer when visually\ninspected. The similarity was expected because both are produced by the same organisms.\nFew data are available on the ratio of FB2\/FB1 and FB2 seems more prevalent than in a\nprevious report (Battilani et al., 2008). However, the patterns of both fumonisins were not\nsufficiently correlated for the cross-variograms to detect it. Similarly, the cross-variogram did\nnot show significant correlation between the number of Fusarium infected kernels and each\nof the fumonisins. Again this could be due to the limited number of samples. It may also be\nthat the absence of infected kernels gives a low or zero mycotoxin concentration, but the\npresence of a large number of infected kernels does not necessarily correspond to large\nconcentrations because of other factors.\nGiven the evidence found for spatial structure in two dimensions by Rivas Casado et al.\n(2009a) and the inconclusive results here, further research is needed into the presence of\nthree-dimensional structure. This needs to consider the influence of several factors, including\nthe type (barn or silo) and depth of the store, the method of loading , the average level of\ncontamination and the effects of mixing as commodities are moved from stores to vehicles\nfor transport and back into storage. If there was spatial autocorrelation it could be isotropic\n(the same in all directions), or anisotropic if the vertical properties were different from the\nhorizontal ones. There might also be vertical trends due to relationships between disease and\ngrain size. The objective should be the development of practical sampling plans for\nmonitoring.\nThe arrangement of the sampling planes in this study was constrained by the practical\nproblems of sampling from a deep bed of maize and the available time and resources. The\nideal protocol for such studies in future would sample without disturbance from as many\nhorizontal planes as the depth allowed, and would have a minimum of 8 x 8 points, preferably\n10 x 10, in each plane to give a rectilinear grid in three dimensions. Clearly equipment would\nhave to be designed to facilitate this. Nested sampling designs could be implemented to\ncharacterise the spatial variability of the mycotoxins at different scales.\nConclusions\nThis paper presents the first analysis of the spatial structure of a three dimensional data set of\nfumonisin B1 and B2. There was no clear evidence of spatial structure in either the two-\ndimensional or three-dimensional analyses. The number of infected kernels was not a good\nindicator for the prediction of fumonisin concentration and there was no spatial correlation\nbetween the concentrations of the two fumonisins.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by the UK Food Standards Agency Project CO3055.\nReferences\nBarnes R.J. 1991.
