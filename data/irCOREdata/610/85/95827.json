We review answers from evolutionary theory, sociology, and economics.\nSometimes in direct conflict with each other, these accounts of grandparental investment exist side-by-side, with little or no\ntheoretical integration. They all account for some of the data, and none account for all of it. We call for a more comprehensive\ntheoretical framework of grandparental investment that addresses its proximate and ultimate causes, and its variability due to\nlineage, values, norms, institutions (e.g., inheritance laws), and social welfare regimes. This framework needs to take into account\nthat the demographic shift to low fecundity and mortality in economically developed countries has profoundly altered basic\nparameters of grandparental investment. We then turn to the possible impact of grandparental acts of altruism, and examine\nwhether benefits of grandparental care in industrialized societies may manifest in terms of less tangible dimensions, such as the\ngrandchildren\u2019s cognitive and verbal ability, mental health, and well-being. Although grandparents in industrialized societies\ncontinue to invest substantial amounts of time and money in their grandchildren, we find a paucity of studies investigating the\ninfluence that this investment has on grandchildren in low-risk family contexts. Under circumstances of duress \u2013 for example,\nteenage pregnancy or maternal depression \u2013 there is converging evidence that grandparents can provide support that helps to\nsafeguard their children and grandchildren against adverse risks. We conclude by discussing the role that grandparents could play\nin what has been referred to as Europe\u2019s demographic suicide.\nKeywords: child development; demographic transition; empathy; grandmother hypothesis; grandparental investment; grandparental\nsolicitude; intergenerational transfers; kin altruism; maternal depression; reciprocal altruism\n1. Introduction\nWhat is it about grandparents that is so lovely? I\u2019d like to say that\ngrandparents are God\u2019s gifts to children. And if they can but see,\nhear and feel what these people have to give, they can mature at a\nfast rate.\n\u2014 Bill Cosby\nYou have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather\nwas.\n\u2014 Irish proverb\nThe best babysitters, of course, are the baby\u2019s grandparents. You feel\ncompletely comfortable entrusting your baby to them for long\nperiods, which is why most grandparents flee to Florida.\n\u2014 Dave Barry (Babies and Other Hazards of Sex, 1984, p. 54)\nFrom birth to adulthood children are gas-guzzlers. Across\nthree traditional South American mixed-economy hunter\u2013\ngatherer and horticulturist societies, Kaplan (1994) found\nthat a child from birth to age 18 years consumes between\n10 and 13 million more calories than the child itself\nproduces. Who foots the bill? In cooperative breeding\nspecies such as humans, where child-rearing is not the\nexclusive domain of the parents, alloparents \u2013 that is,\nhelpers other than the biological parents (Hrdy 1999;\n2009) \u2013 can step up. According to the cooperative breed-\ning hypothesis, ancestral mothers evolved in groups\n\u201cwhere a broad range of individuals \u2013 not just the\ngenetic father \u2013 assist the genetic mother in protecting,\ncarrying, or provisioning offspring, thereby permitting\nDAVID COALL is a Research Assistant Professor in the\nCommunity, Culture, and Mental Health Unit, School\nof Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences at the Univer-\nsity of Western Australia. Still early in his research\ncareer, he has authored 11 publications across the\nfields of human biology, psychology, and pediatrics.\nHe is especially interested in applying evolutionary\ntheory to understand variation in human health and\ndisease with a particular focus on intergenerational\neffects and the childhood environment.\nRALPH HERTWIG, Professor of Cognitive and Decision\nSciences at the University of Basel, Switzerland, is the\nauthor of more than 75 publications in the areas of be-\nhavioral decision research and the methodology of\nsocial sciences. He received the German Society for\nPsychology\u2019s Young Scientist Award in 1996 and\nEarly Career Award in 2006.\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33, 1\u201359\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991105\n# Cambridge University Press 2010 0140-525X\/10 $40.00 1\nher to produce and rear costlier, slower-maturing offspring\nthan otherwise would survive\u201d (Hrdy 2005a, p. 69).\nIndeed, Kaplan observed that a child\u2019s \u201cexcessive\u201d con-\nsumption is offset by adults who, between 20 and 40\nyears of age, produce an average surplus of 2,000 to\n4,000 calories a day, which is generally maintained until\n65 years of age (see also Kaplan 1997; Kaplan et al. 2000).\nWho are these seeming altruists? Although it is still being\ndebated whether the key sources of this and other help are\nfathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, siblings, or children\n(e.g., Hawkes et al. 1989; Hill 1993; Hrdy 1999; Ivey\n2000; Kramer 2005a), both formal and informal models\npoint to the evolutionary significance of intergenerational\ntransfers (e.g., Bogin 1997; Hamilton 1966; Lee 2003a;\n2008). Specifically, because individuals can increase their\nfitness by reproducing themselves or by helping kin who\nshare common genes by descent (Hamilton 1964), kin\nselection theory (Maynard Smith 1964) predicts that it is\nmost likely that these helpful individuals in the mother\u2019s\nsocial group will be close kin, such as children, siblings,\nuncles, aunts, and, crucially, grandparents. Indeed,\nalthough humans are similar to other cooperative breeding\nanimals in many respects, it is the presence of knowledge-\nable, postreproductive helpers that sets them apart (Hrdy\n2005b). During the prolonged postreproductive period,\ngrandparents may have the opportunity and the motive\nto boost their own fitness by investing resources in their\nchildren\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s survival and reproduction.\nThe opportunity for grandparents to care for their kin\nhas never been as great as it is today. With increasing\nhuman life expectancy in industrialized societies \u2013 for\nexample, in the United States, women\u2019s life expectancy\nin the 20th century has increased from 50.7 (born 1900)\nto 79.7 (born 2000) years (see Arias 2006) \u2013 today\u2019s grand-\nparents\u2019 lives and those of their grandchildren overlap\nmarkedly, thus providing them with greater opportunity\nthan ever before to play a significant role (Bengtson\n2001). Empirical evidence supports the considerable role\nthat grandparents play in taking care of their grandchil-\ndren. In Switzerland, for instance, it is estimated that\nunpaid grandparental childcare amounts to at least two\nbillion Swiss francs per year (Bauer & Strub 2002). In\nthe United States, 28% of employed women rely on their\nparents or in-laws to provide childcare for their young chil-\ndren (Guzman 1999). Across ten European countries, 58%\nof grandmothers and 49% of grandfathers provided some\ncare for their grandchild during a 12-month period\n(Hank & Buber 2009; similar percentages are found in\nthe United States: Guzman 2004). A sample of Germans\naged 55 to 69 years was observed to spend, on average,\n12.8 hours each month supervising their grandchildren\n(Kohli et al. 2000).\nDespite grandparents\u2019 historically unparalleled oppor-\ntunity to care for their grandchildren, the impact of their\ninvestments may never have been smaller than it is\ntoday, at least when measured against classic components\nof fitness, such as number of offspring and child mortality.\nSpecifically, with fertility rates below replacement and a\ndelayed age at first childbirth in most industrialized\nsocieties, the probability of becoming a grandparent is\nfalling. Moreover, low childhood mortality rates mean\nthat the high-risk times of infancy \u2013 conditions under\nwhich grandparental investment may have evolved \u2013\nhave largely been removed.\nIn light of these changes in grandparenthood in indus-\ntrialized societies, we ask: Does the help that grandparents\nprovide, which may have benefited grandchildren in\ntraditional and historical populations, still yield benefits\nfor grandchildren in industrialized societies? Our theoreti-\ncal and empirical review in this article is structured as\nfollows. Section 2 defines grandparental investment,\nspells out its underlying evolutionary rationale, and sum-\nmarizes evidence from natural fertility societies. Section\n3 turns to recent extensions of research on grandparental\ninvestment in terms of the notion of grandparental solici-\ntude. Specifically, we review several likely determinants of\ngrandparental investment across human populations. In\nSection 4 we describe economic and sociological accounts\nof grandparental investment. Sometimes in direct conflict\nwith each other, the economic, evolutionary, and socio-\nlogical accounts explain some of the empirical data, but\nnone explain all. Section 5 examines a range of recent\ndemographic changes that render the environment in\nwhich contemporary grandparents find themselves\nunique in human history, and that have profoundly\naltered the basic parameters of grandparental investment.\nIn Sections 6 and 7, we review evidence addressing the\nissue of whether grandparental care, which benefited\ngrandchildren in traditional and historical populations,\nstill yields benefits for grandchildren in industrialized\nsocieties. Finally, in Section 8, we discuss public health\nand policy implications of grandparental investment.\n2. Grandparental investment: Definition,\nevolution, and evidence\n2.1. What is grandparental investment?\nResources invested in one\u2019s offspring are referred to as par-\nental investment (see Geary 2000). Parental investment\nwas originally defined as \u201cany investment by the parent in\nan individual offspring that increases the offspring\u2019s\nchance of surviving (and hence reproductive success) at\nthe cost of the parent\u2019s ability to invest in other offspring\u201d\n(Trivers 1972, p. 139). Trivers\u2019 key point was that the cur-\nrency of parental investment is its cost to the parent\u2019s\nability to invest in other offspring. Therefore, the definition\nof parental investment was highly restrictive. However, a\nbroader definition has evolved that incorporates:\nany characteristics or actions of parents that increase the\nfitness of their offspring at a cost to any component of the\nparent\u2019s fitness . . ., including any costs of parental care to\nthe parent\u2019s subsequent mating success . . . survival . . . fecund-\nity . . . growth . . .. In addition, it is logical to include costs to\nfitness of other offspring or any . . . other relatives. (Clutton-\nBrock 1991, p. 9)\nWe interpret parental investment and, by extension,\ngrandparental investment using this broader frame (see\nalso Dawkins 2006; Geary 2000; Hertwig et al. 2002).\nProxy outcome measures of parental investment and \u2013 to\nthe extent that grandparents influence these outcomes \u2013\ngrandparental investment that have been used include\nchild mortality, birth weight, breast-feeding, infanticide,\nhomicide, abuse, attachment\/bonding between parents\nand infants, inheritance, interbirth interval, and edu-\ncational investment (Hagen et al. 2006). The pathway\nthrough which grandparental investment affects a child\u2019s\ndevelopment can be direct (e.g., direct support, advice,\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n2 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nor as a role model) and indirect via a third party (most\noften the grandchildren\u2019s parents).\n2.2. Why grandparental investment?\nCooperative breeding species such as humans can increase\ntheir inclusive fitness directly by reproducing themselves\nor indirectly by helping their relatives, who share a pro-\nportion of their genotype by descent, to transmit their\ngenes into future generations (Hamilton 1964). Grandpar-\nents can boost their inclusive fitness by devoting resources\nto their kin, helping to ensure the conception, birth, survi-\nval, growth, development, and reproduction of their rela-\ntives. The opportunity to increase indirect fitness is\nafforded by the long human lifespan in general, and in par-\nticular by the extensive postreproductive lifespan of\nhuman females that is unique among cooperative breeding\nanimals (Hrdy 2005b). Although various forms of repro-\nductive termination occur across a range of species\n(Cohen 2004; Packer et al. 1998; Paul 2005), humans are\nthe only primate species in which reproductive termin-\nation is a distinct and universal trait (Caro et al. 1995;\nPavelka & Fedigan 1991). The survival of an organism\nbeyond reproduction represents a biological anomaly:\n\u201c[T]here should be little or no postreproductive period\nin the normal lifecycle of any species\u201d (Williams 1957,\np. 407). Attempting to explain this anomaly, Williams\nhypothesized that it would be adaptive to cease reproduc-\ntion before death if the benefits to the woman\u2019s survival \u2013\nthat is, removal of the risks associated with dying during\nchildbirth, and the increased parenting effort that she\ncould devote to her living children and grandchildren \u2013\noutweighed the benefits to reproductive fitness brought\nto the woman by further reproduction.\nCouched in terms of \u201cHamilton\u2019s Rule\u201d (Hamilton\n1964), postreproductive helping behavior will evolve\nwhen an individual can help a related individual, who\nhas a probability r (i.e., coefficient of relatedness) of\nsharing this same gene by common descent, to survive\nand reproduce. This holds as long as the benefit (B, i.e.,\nbenefit to the relative receiving help), multiplied by the\nprobability of sharing that gene (r), outweighs the cost\n(C) to the helper, in terms of his own survival and\nforgone reproductive opportunities. To wit, postreproduc-\ntive helping behavior should evolve when rB . C. It is\nlikely that this condition held for human ancestors\nbecause (a) grandparents are closely related to their grand-\nchildren (grandparents, on average, share 25% of their\ngenes with each of their grandchildren, over and above\nthe large proportion of genes that all humans share in\nany case; Dawkins 2006), (b) helping comes with a rela-\ntively low opportunity cost, in terms of the grandparent\u2019s\nown reproductive success (especially in the case of postre-\nproductive grandparents), and (c) there is a potentially\nlarge benefit to grandchildren in terms of survival (and\nsubsequent reproduction) during the high-risk times of\ninfancy and childhood.1\nInstigated by Williams\u2019 (1957) suggestion of the poten-\ntial adaptive value of a postreproductive period, two\nrelated lines of reasoning have emerged, both emphasizing\nthe vast investments required by the long childhood devel-\nopment period: the good-mother hypothesis and the\ngrandmother hypothesis (reviews by Jamison et al. 2002;\nPeccei 2001a; Voland et al. 2005).2 The good-mother\nhypothesis holds that burdened with the long dependence\nof human children, a postreproductive period shields the\nmother from survival risks (i.e., pregnancy and giving\nbirth) and the child from health risks (e.g., Down syn-\ndrome), and enables the mother to free up the resources\nto keep her children, particularly the youngest and most\nhelpless, alive. This investment contributes to the\nmother\u2019s direct reproductive success by ensuring that her\nexisting children survive. Thus, one would expect to see\nthe presence of a mother and her increased longevity\nimproving the survival chances and health state of her\nchildren, and we do.3\nThe grandmother hypothesis suggests that a postrepro-\nductive grandmother can foster her inclusive fitness by\nsupporting her reproductive daughter and her grandchil-\ndren, thus increasing her daughter\u2019s fertility and improv-\ning her grandchildren\u2019s chances of surviving (e.g., Hrdy\n1999). Moving the provisioning of children from exclu-\nsively the mother (i.e., breast-feeding) to allomothers, as\nthe grandmother hypothesis proposes, has immediate\nreproductive consequences that could translate into\ninclusive fitness advantages for the allomothers (grand-\nmothers): For example, ceasing to breast-feed terminates\nthe mother\u2019s lactational amenorrhea (Ellison 1990), thus\npotentially reducing the interval to the daughter\u2019s next\npregnancy. Comparative data confirm that humans wean\ntheir children at a younger age and have shorter inter-\nbirth intervals than do orangutans, gorillas, and chimpan-\nzees (Hawkes et al. 1998; Kramer 2005a; Lancaster et al.\n2000). The notion of the helpful grandmother, however,\nshould not be conceptualized as selection to blindly maxi-\nmize the number of offspring, because any increase in\nnumber of descendents is often accompanied by a\ndecrease in investment per offspring and potentially survi-\nval (e.g., Coall et al. 2009; Gibson & Mace 2005; Walker\net al. 2008). Thus, we would expect to see the presence\nof a grandmother and her increased longevity improving\nthe fertility of her daughter, but not at the expense of\nthe survival and health of her grandchildren.\nAlthough the good-mother hypothesis and the grand-\nmother hypothesis, which are not mutually exclusive,\npredict a selective advantage associated with a postrepro-\nductive lifespan, attempts at modeling this advantage in\ncontemporary, largely natural fertility, human populations\nhave failed to support these hypotheses (e.g., Hill &\nHurtado 1991; 1996; Rogers 1993; see also Austad 1994).\nThe benefits of early reproductive cessation in women \u2013\ndiverting resources from reproduction to maternal care\nand avoiding the costs of continuing to reproduce \u2013 do\nnot appear to outweigh the benefits of having additional\nchildren. However, consideration of additional costs,\nsuch as the decline in fertility with older age, increased\nperinatal mortality risk associated with giving birth at an\nolder age, and increased competition with increased\nfamily size, as well as the variety of additional benefits \u2013\nearlier reproduction in daughters, improved growth and\nsurvival of grandchildren \u2013 suggests that the benefits of\nswitching from reproduction to parenting could indeed\noutweigh the costs (Hrdy 2005a; Mace 2000; Turke\n1997). Moreover, a recent analysis of data from two\nGambian villages (1950\u20131975) showed that menopause\nmay have a fitness advantage when the combined influence\nof both the increased maternal mortality associated with\ngiving birth at an older age and the increased childhood\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 3\nsurvival associated with having a maternal grandmother\npresent are taken into account (Shanley et al. 2007; see\nalso Sear et al. 2000; Shanley & Kirkwood 2001). Thus,\nthe joint positive influence of a \u201cgood mother\u201d and a\n\u201chelpful grandmother\u201d on survival during childhood may\nhave created a selective advantage for postreproductive\nsurvival in women.\n2.3. Why postreproductive lifespan may not be adaptive\nIn contrast to the aforementioned views, there are evol-\nutionary theories proposing that the early cessation of\nreproduction, which implies the availability of postrepro-\nductive grandmothers, is an exaptation. It is not or was\nnot originally adaptive (for reviews, see Peccei 2001a;\nVoland et al. 2005). On this view, menopause occurs\nbecause a woman has lived long enough to deplete the\nsupply of primary oocytes with which she was born\n(Ellison 2001; but see Johnson et al. 2004; Skaznik-\nWikiel et al. 2007). Several theories of senescence\npropose that small fitness benefits early in an individual\u2019s\nlife will be selected for even if they exact a cost to fitness\nlater in life. The reduced strength of natural selection at\nolder ages permits these negative effects to remain unchal-\nlenged (Kirkwood 1977; Medawar 1952; Williams 1957).\nTherefore, rather than being advantageous itself, meno-\npause may be a by-product of the adaptive benefit of\nproducing, protecting, and storing a complete stock of\nprimary oocytes at birth (Pavelka & Fedigan 1991). Con-\nsistent with this interpretation is the similarity of human\nand chimpanzee ovarian follicle depletion rates (Jones\net al. 2007; for gorillas see Atsalis & Margulis 2008),\nwhich suggests that menopause may be a phylogenetic\nlegacy and not unique to humans.\nEven if this is the case, and menopause is a non-adaptive\nepiphenomenon that occurs because of humans\u2019 longevity,\nits presence creates the stage for helpful grandmothers.\nBogin and Smith (1996) proposed a biocultural model in\nwhich menopause is non-adaptive but helpful grand-\nmothers still play a central role. Once women started\nliving past their reproductive ceiling, the only way that\nthey could improve their inclusive fitness was by caring\nfor their children and grandchildren.Whether human long-\nevity and specifically the postreproductive longevity associ-\nated with menopause is adaptive or an epiphenomenon,\ngrandparents are still in the right place, at the right time.\n2.4. Does grandparental investment enhance fitness?\nEvidence from natural fertility societies\nThe influence of helpful grandmothers has been most\nintensively studied in historical and contemporary\nnatural fertility societies with little or no access to\nmodern medical care, including contraception. In these\nsocieties, grandparental investment matters for mothers\u2019\nreproductive success. Sear and Mace\u2019s (2008) review of\n45 studies investigating the presence of kin (father, grand-\nparents, older siblings) supports the beneficial influence of\npostreproductive relatives: The presence of a maternal or\npaternal grandmother was associated with an increase in\nher grandchildren\u2019s probability of surviving in 69% (9 of\n13 studies) and in 53% (9 of 17 studies) of cases, respect-\nively. For illustration, in their time series analysis of the\nOromo agro-pastoralists of southern Ethiopia, Gibson\nand Mace (2005) found that the presence of a hard-\nworking maternal grandmother, who helped the mother\nwith heavy domestic tasks (e.g., grinding maize), increased\nthe probability of a grandchild surviving to three years of\nage by 25%. This effect is comparable to that achieved\nby installing a new water supply (Gibson & Mace 2006).\nOmnipresent grandparents, however, are not inevitably\nadvantageous. Sear and Mace (2008) found evidence that\nthe presence of grandparents has been associated with\ndetrimental consequences for child survival. In 83% (10\nof 12 studies) of cases, the presence of maternal grand-\nfathers had no effect, and in 75% the paternal grandfather\nhad no effect or even a negative one on survival. There is\ncurrently little evidence supporting the adaptive signifi-\ncance of grandfathering (see Lahdenpera\u00a8 et al. 2007).\nNegative effects have also been reported for paternal\ngrandmothers who may, in contrast to maternal grand-\nmothers, increase their daughter-in-law\u2019s fertility at the\nexpense of grandchild survival (Leonetti et al. 2005;\n2007; Mace & Sear 2005). For example, in a historical\nGerman population (1720\u20131874), the presence of a\npaternal grandmother increased a grandchild\u2019s risk of still-\nbirth by 35% (Voland & Beise 2005) and infant mortality\nup to one month of age by 85% (Voland & Beise 2002).\nThemajority of these studies have been conducted in patri-\nlineal societies; recent evidence from a matrilineal society\nsuggests that even maternal grandmothers may have a\nnegative effect under some circumstances (Sear 2008; but\nsee Leonetti et al. 2005). The beneficial influence of grand-\nparents cannot be taken as given. But there is evidence that\nthe presence of maternal grandmothers in particular boosts\nthe survival chances of their grandchildren.\n2.5. The issue of confounding effects\nThe grandparental investment literature consists predomi-\nnantly of correlational studies showing associations, or lack\nthereof, between grandparental presence and grandchild\nsurvival, for example. Of course, these studies do not\nshow that this relationship is causal (Borgerhoff Mulder\n2007; Sear & Mace 2008). Some argue that shared genes\nor environment effects may equally account for the\nobserved associations. Grandparents who live under\ngood socioeconomic conditions or who have a fortuitous\ngenetic complement are more likely to live long and\nhealthy lives, and it would make sense that their grandchil-\ndren are more likely to survive, are healthier, or have\nbetter cognitive abilities (e.g., Modin & Fritzell 2009).\nAlthough this possibility cannot be ruled out, several\npieces of evidence speak against it. First, if the effect is\ndue to shared genes or environment, one would expect\nthat all grandparents who share the same proportion of\ngenes by common descent or share their residence with\na grandchild to have similar effects on grandchild survival.\nClearly, this is not the case, as we discuss in the next\nsection. Second, the detailed ethnographic accounts that\naccompany many correlational studies not only corrobo-\nrate associations between kin presence and survival,\ngrowth, and development, but also highlight potential\nbehaviors that promote these beneficial effects (e.g.,\nGibson & Mace 2005; Leonetti et al. 2007). Third, many\nstudies allow adjustment for a wide range of confounding\nvariables (e.g., grandparental health, age, socioeconomic\nstatus, and residential distance) that at least partially\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n4 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\ncontrol for shared environment effects (e.g., Borgerhoff\nMulder 2007; Coall et al. 2009; Pollet et al. 2006). Taken\ntogether, this evidence suggests that it is unlikely that\nthese effects can be explained away by shared gene or\nshared environment effects.\n3. Grandparental solicitude\nGrandparental helping behavior will not occur invariably,\nbut, according to Hamilton\u2019s rule, is moderated by oppor-\ntunity costs that may differ across types of grandparents\n(e.g., grandmother vs. grandfather). Indeed, one of the\nmost robust findings across the grandparental investment\nliterature is that maternal grandmothers invest the most,\nhave most contact, and the closest relationships with\ntheir grandchildren, followed by maternal grandfathers,\npaternal grandmothers, and, finally, paternal grand-\nfathers.4 Next to grandparent type, grandparental help is\nalso likely to be a function of ecological conditions that\ndetermine the availability of grandparental resources,\nincluding the communities\u2019 subsistence strategy (e.g., the\nefficiency of food production), availability of relatives,\nmarriage systems, residence patterns, inheritance pat-\nterns, and the health of relatives (reviewed by Sear &\nMace 2008). In what follows, we review five evolutionary\nfactors that affect grandparents\u2019 inclination to invest\ntheir resources \u2013 genetic relatedness, paternity certainty,\nsex-specific reproductive strategies, reproductive value,\nand sex-biased grandparental investment \u2013 and two\nfactors that influence the availability of resources \u2013\nfamily size and birth order.\n3.1. Genetic relatedness\nHamilton\u2019s rule implies that the amount of resources\ntransferred to an individual should depend on the related-\nness of the provider (r, the coefficient of relatedness). The\ncloser the genetic relationship between two individuals,\nthe more likely helping behaviors will evolve and the\nsmaller the benefit needs to be for this altruism to be\nmaintained (Hamilton 1964). There has been a long\nhistory of research suggesting that parents allocate their\nresources to children according to their genetic related-\nness (e.g., Anderson 2005; Daly & Wilson 1980; but see\nHofferth & Anderson 2003). Evidence that grandparents\nfavor genetically related grandchildren also exists. The\ninvestment that grandparents make in a family reduces\nas the proportion of stepchildren in the family increases\n(Eggebeen 1992). Relatedly, relationships with step-\ngrandparents are not considered to be as close as those\nwith biological grandparents (Aldous 1995). In lesbian-\nmother families, grandchildren have more contact with\nthe biological grandparents compared with non-biological\ngrandparents (Patterson et al. 1998). Although the size of\nthe variance accounted for in these studies and the neces-\nsity of a focus on genetic relatedness has been questioned\n(Rose & Rose 2001), the patterns appear robust (see\nAnderson 2005).\n3.2. Paternity certainty\nPaternity uncertainty is the (perceived) risk that amale is not\nthe biological father of his children. In contrast to males,\nbecause of internal fertilization mammalian mothers know\ncategorically who their children are (Trivers 1972). In the\nfew mammalian species in which males provide parental\ninvestment, they run the risk that their investment is being\nwasted on another male\u2019s offspring (Alexander 1974;\nClutton-Brock 1991; Geary 2000; Trivers 1972). Both theor-\netical and empirical studies suggest that lower levels of\npaternity certainty are associated with reduced male par-\nental care (see Anderson et al. 2007).\nThis logic can be extended to grandparents and their\ninclination to invest resources: Because the maternal\ngrandmother is certain of her relationship with her daugh-\nter and her daughter\u2019s relationship with her grandchil-\ndren, it is predicted that maternal grandmothers will\ninvest the most. Paternal grandfathers, on the other\nhand, are predicted to invest the least because there are\ntwo points of uncertainty between themselves and their\ngrandchildren: They are not 100% certain of their relation-\nship with their son nor of their son\u2019s relationship with their\ngrandchildren. The maternal grandfather and paternal\ngrandmother are indistinguishable between these two\nextremes and will both invest an intermediate amount,\nbecause they both have one point at which their relation-\nship certainty with their grandchildren could be severed\n(Smith 1987; 1988).\nConsistent with these predictions, across human\nsocieties maternal kin invest much more than paternal\nkin during the prenatal, delivery, and postnatal periods\n(Huber et al. 2004; Meehan 2005), and paternity uncer-\ntainty seems to be associated with reduced intergenera-\ntional investment from the father (Anderson et al. 2007;\nKurland 1979) and the father\u2019s relatives (Gaulin & Schle-\ngel 1980; Hartung 1985). Yet, some caution should be\ntaken in interpreting the effect of paternity uncertainty.\nPaternity certainty varies considerably across human\nsocieties (Anderson 2006). Moreover, throughout recent\nhuman history paternity certainty has increased substan-\ntially in many cultures (Gaulin 1980). Although the rebut-\ntal to this statement is usually that paternity certainty was\nlower in our ancestral environment, and it is to this that\nhumans are tuned, the findings that investment varies by\npaternity certainty within communities suggest that\nhumans respond to local conditions. Other authors state\nthat focusing on paternity certainty alone is inadequate\n(Euler & Weitzel 1996; Pashos & McBurney 2008) and\nthat in patrilateral and patrilocal societies it is unable to\naccount for the higher levels of investment by paternal\nrelatives (Pashos 2000; but see Gibson & Mace 2005).\n3.3. Sex-specific reproductive strategies\nSeveral authors have addressed the limits of paternity cer-\ntainty by incorporating sex-specific reproductive strategies\ninto their models of grandparental investment (Euler &\nMichalski 2007; Euler & Weitzel 1996; Huber & Bree-\ndlove 2007). Because of the large energetic investment\nin the egg, as compared with the sperm, females are\nphysiologically obligated to provide higher levels of par-\nental investment than males (Bateman 1948). In\nmammals, internal gestation and the production of milk\nfor offspring further increase this asymmetry (Clutton-\nBrock 1989). Whereas females may focus on parental\ninvestment, producing a few high-quality offspring,\nmales (because of their low levels of parental investment)\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 5\ncan increase their reproductive success by mating with\nadditional females. Therefore, investment put into\nfemale kin is more likely to be transformed into parental\ncare, whereas resources invested in a son may be used\nfor mating or parenting effort.\nIn light of this, individuals are assumed to be more\ninclined to invest in female relatives, whether providing\npractical help in the form of childcare or more social\nand psychological support (Euler & Weitzel 1996; Euler\net al. 2001). Extending this logic to grandparents, maternal\ngrandparents who invest in their daughters and their chil-\ndren are expected to invest more than paternal grandpar-\nents who are investing in their sons and their sons\u2019\nchildren (Euler & Weitzel 1996). In fact, this female kin\nbias in grandparental investment has been found across\ndisciplines and societies (e.g., Gibson & Mace 2005;\nHuber et al. 2004; Rossi & Rossi 1990).\nWhen combined with the notion of paternity certainty,\nsex-specific reproductive strategies further differentiate\nbetween the maternal grandfather and paternal grand-\nmother. Because the maternal grandfather invests in his\ndaughter\u2019s children, he invests more than the paternal\ngrandmother who invests in her son\u2019s children (Euler &\nWeitzel 1996). Evidence supports the significantly higher\ninvestment by maternal grandfathers compared with\npaternal grandmothers in the frequency of face-to-face\ninteractions and emotional closeness (Hoffman 1980).\nThus, the combination of paternity uncertainty and sex-\nspecific reproductive strategies predicts the often-found\npattern of grandparental investment where the maternal\ngrandmother invests the most, followed by the maternal\ngrandfather, the paternal grandmother, and the paternal\ngrandfather (e.g., Bishop et al. [2009] and their summary\nof the data; but for different interpretations, see Huber\n& Breedlove 2007; Pollet et al. 2006).\n3.4. Reproductive value\nAn individual\u2019s age-specific future reproductive potential,\nthe reproductive value, is another likely factor that influ-\nences how many resources he or she receives. If a\nparent or grandparent has the option of investing in his\nor her child who has just negotiated puberty and is begin-\nning her reproductive career, or in that child\u2019s sibling who\nis equally related (r \u00bc .5) but is approaching the end of her\nreproductive career, the child\u2019s higher reproductive value\nmay strongly influence this decision. Relatedly, one would\nexpect grandparents to transfer resources to grandchildren\nas a function of their reproductive value, with grandpar-\nents favoring those grandchildren who have a higher prob-\nability of reproducing in the future (Leek & Smith 1991;\nSmith 1991; Smith et al. 1987).\nReproductive value may help us to understand, in part,\nwhy grandparents go to such enormous lengths and often\nself-sacrifice to support their teenage daughters who\nbecome parents. Individuals who have recently gone\nthrough puberty and are ready to begin their reproductive\ncareers are at their peak reproductive value, which will\ngradually decline with age (Fisher 1930; Hamilton 1966;\nWilliams 1957). If the aim is to maximize one\u2019s number\nof descendants in the future, preferentially investing in\nthese high reproductive value young adults may be wise.\nAnalyses conducted by Hughes (1988, as cited in Barrett\net al. 2002, pp. 53\u201355) suggest that it is these young\nadults with high reproductive value who have the largest\ninfluence on any related individual\u2019s inclusive fitness. This\ninfluence is greater than that of any other segment of the\ncommunity. Thus, the high cost that some grandparents\nincur in helping their children through teenage parenthood\nmay be outweighed by the inclusive fitness benefits, both in\ncontemporary and in ancestral environments.\n3.5. Sex-biased grandparental investment\nUnder certain conditions, biasing investment preferen-\ntially towards sons or daughters may increase the prob-\nability that an individual will have grandchildren in the\nfuture (Trivers & Willard 1973). In populations where\nmembers of one sex have higher potential reproductive\nsuccess, grandparents may increase their inclusive fitness\nby preferentially investing in grandsons over granddaugh-\nters, or vice versa (see Euler &Weitzel 1996; Jamison et al.\n2002; Smith 1988). In theory, this may be possible to\nexplore; however, studies examining this Trivers-Willard\nhypothesis in humans across just two generations have\nshown mixed results, and examining it over three gener-\nations will be even more challenging. To our knowledge,\nthere is currently no convincing evidence of sex-biased\ngrandparental investment in humans.\nTable 1 summarizes our review of the evolutionary\nfactors that can be expected to moderate grandparents\u2019\ninclination to invest their resources. We now turn to two\nfactors that are likely to affect the availability of grandpar-\nental resources.\n3.6. The availability of resources: Family size and birth\norder\nActual investments presuppose the availability of\nresources, which, in turn, depends on numerous variables,\nsuch as the socioeconomic status of the grandparents and\ntheir state of health. Two factors \u2013 family size and birth\norder \u2013 are often incorporated into evolutionary analyses\nof parental and grandparental investments (e.g., Hagen\net al. 2006; Kaplan 1994; Laham et al. 2005; Lawson &\nMace 2009; Leonetti et al. 2005), and both affect the\namount of resources to be distributed.\nAlthough larger families can recruit older siblings to\nprovide resources for a family (Kramer 2002; 2005a),\nincreased family size typically dilutes the resources avail-\nable for each child (Blake 1987; Hertwig et al. 2002;\nMarks 2006) and grandchild (Laham et al. 2005; Leonetti\net al. 2005; Uhlenberg & Hammill 1998). In a study of 787\nAustralian university students, Laham et al. (2005)\nobserved that the emotional closeness that a grandchild\nreported to his\/her maternal grandfather or paternal\ngrandmother depended on the availability of other kin\n(see also Smith 1988). Moreover, the general finding that\nmaternal grandfathers provide more investment to grand-\nchildren than do paternal grandmothers (Eisenberg 1988;\nEuler & Weitzel 1996; Hoffman 1980; Pashos 2000) only\nheld when the paternal grandmothers had other children\nin whom to invest.\nJust as increased family size dilutes the resources avail-\nable for each child and grandchild, so too does a higher\nbirth order (Coall et al. 2009; Van Bavel 2006). Further-\nmore, there is good evidence that birth order has an\nadditional nonlinear influence on the distribution pattern\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n6 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nof parental and grandparental investment. Even if parents\naim to invest equally in all of their offspring, an unavoid-\nable unequal distribution of resources results due to the\neffects of birth order (Hertwig et al. 2002). The reason is\nthat only the first and last born children have periods of\ninvestment that are not jeopardized by competition from\nsiblings, thus undercutting middle-borns in a way that\nmay have long-term consequences for family cohesion\nand relationships (Salmon & Daly 1998; see review of evi-\ndence in Hertwig et al. 2002). By analogy, grandparents\nwho invest equally in all of their grandchildren will also\nundercut middle-born grandchildren (but not so for\nbequests; see Bernheim & Severinov 2000).\nLast but not least, as grandparents aremaking the invest-\nment, grandparent\u2019s family size may matter as well. In a\nstudy of 580 grandparent\u2013grandchild relationships, Coall\net al. (2009) found that grandparent\u2019s family size (i.e.,\nnumber of children and grandchildren) explained approxi-\nmately three times more of the variance in grandparental\ninvestment (shared contacts, occasions to meet, discus-\nsions, activities, interests, and important roles) than grand-\nchild\u2019s family size (i.e., number of siblings and birth order).\n4. Grandparental investment: Beyond kin-based\nexplanations\nAccording to the dominant Darwinian explanation, grand-\nparents can increase the representation of their genes in\nfuture generations by providing help to their children\nand grandchildren. Kin altruism, however, is only one of\nseveral possible accounts of grandparental investment.\nWithin the social sciences, the two disciplines that have\nbeen most concerned with the topic of intergenerational\ntransfers \u2013 of which grandparental investment is one\nmanifestation \u2013 are economics and sociology. Next, we\nreview economic and sociological accounts of grandparen-\ntal investments and a Darwinian account that shifts the\nemphasis in explanations of grandparental investment\nfrom ultimate causes to proximate mechanisms.\n4.1. The economic view: Altruism versus mutual\nreciprocity\nIn the economic literature, grandparental investment is\ntypically treated as part of the same type of transfers\nalong the intergenerational chain that characterizes par-\nental transfers to children (although there are three-\ngeneration variants of exchange, see e.g., Cigno 1993).\nParental investment, in turn, has been an important\nsubject of economic analysis at least since Becker (1974;\n1991) and Barro\u2019s (1974) influential work on why parents\ncare about the well-being of their progeny. Since then,\nhowever, as Arrondel and Masson (2006) noted, there\nhas been an \u201cimpressive blossoming of miscellaneous\nmodels and motivations introduced in the literature\u201d\n(p. 980), possibly due to the fact that the diverse\nTable 1. Factors associated with the inclination to invest grandparental resources (factors are derived using an evolutionary framework)\nGenetic relatedness\n1. The closer the genetic relationship is between two individuals, the more likely helping behaviors will evolve and the smaller the\ninclusive fitness benefit needs to be to maintain the helping behaviors (Hamilton 1964)\n2. Because of the close genetic relationship between them, grandparents are inclined to invest in their grandchildren\nPaternity certainty\n1. Mammalian mothers know categorically who their children are because of internal fertilization. Males, however, are less than 100%\nsure who their children are (Trivers 1972)\n2. Any father\u2013child link in the relationship between a grandparent and grandchild reduces the certainty of their relationship below\nunity (Smith 1987; 1988)\nSex-specific reproductive strategies\n1. Females are physiologically and psychologically obligated to provide higher levels of parental investment than males (Bateman 1948;\nClutton-Brock 1989; Hrdy 1999)\n2. Males, due to their lower levels of parental investment, can potentially increase their reproductive success by mating with additional\nfemales (Bateman 1948; Trivers 1972)\n3. Due to these sex-specific reproductive strategies, resources invested in female kin are more likely to be used for parental care\n4. Individuals are more inclined to invest in female relatives (Euler & Michalski 2007; Euler & Weitzel 1996)\n5. Maternal grandparents who invest in their daughters and their daughters\u2019 children are expected to invest more than paternal\ngrandparents who are investing in their sons (see Gibson & Mace 2005; Huber et al. 2004; Rossi & Rossi 1990)\n6. Considering the grandparents\u2019 sex-specific reproductive strategies, grandmothers will invest more in their grandchildren than will\ngrandfathers (Huber et al. 2004; Huber & Breedlove 2007)\nReproductive value\n1. Grandparents will be more inclined to invest resources in children and grandchildren who have a higher probability of surviving and\nreproducing in the future (Leek & Smith 1991; Smith 1991; Smith et al. 1987)\n2. Post-reproductive grandparents who have low reproductive value may invest more in their grandchildren than would relatives with\nthe same coefficient of relatedness but higher reproductive value (e.g., aunts; Hames 1988)\nSex-biased grandparental investment\n1. If there is a differential fitness return from investing in sons or daughters, parents and grandparents will be inclined to bias their\ninvestment to get the best fitness return from their investment (Trivers & Willard 1973)\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 7\nmanifestations of intergenerational transfers \u2013 for\ninstance, post-mortem or inter-vivos (transfers among\nliving members of the family), financial or time transfers,\nupward or downward transfers \u2013 are assumed to have\ndifferent determinants and to serve different goals. Conse-\nquently, there is no single overarching model of parental,\nlet alone grandparental, investment, although most models\nrest on the utility maximization and rational choice frame-\nwork. Reviewing these manifold accounts of intergenera-\ntional transfers is beyond the scope of this article;\nmoreover, such reviews already exist (e.g., Arrondel &\nMasson 2006; Cigno 2006; Cremer & Pestieau 2006;\nLaferre`re & Wolff 2006). Instead, we focus \u2013 at the\nexpense of other motives (e.g., a \u201cwarm glow\u201d associated\nwith the very act of giving; Andreoni 1990) \u2013 on the two\ncompeting motives that a large proportion of economic\nmodels of intergenerational transfers have emphasized to\nexplain inter-vivos intergenerational transfers: altruism\nand self-interested exchange.\nWhy do parents desiring to maximize their self-interest\nmake enormous investments in their children? According\nto the Barro\u2013Becker view, the solution to this puzzle is\nthat a parent\u2019s welfare is influenced by the welfare of\nfuture generations. Formally, the parent\u2019s utility function\nis augmented by the child\u2019s likely lifetime utility (e.g.,\nBarro 1974; Becker & Tomes 1976; 1979), thus explaining\nwhy parents transfer resources to their children. Parents\ntry to maximize total child quality as defined by the sum\nof their children\u2019s adult wealth. The model posits that\nparents allocate the resources as a function of child\nquality (e.g., the child\u2019s own skills and abilities), and\nlater use wealth transfers to equalize outcomes across chil-\ndren (redistributive neutrality). Successive generations are\nlinked by recursive altruistic preferences, that is, individ-\nuals have an altruistic concern only for their children,\nwho in turn care altruistically for their children. Parents\nthus expect their children to adopt similarly altruistic be-\nhavior towards their children, and so on; thereby all gener-\nations of a family are linked together by a chain of\nintergenerational transfers.\nAccording to the second motive, parents\u2019 transfers are\nless \u201cpure,\u201d but part of a bargaining between parents\nand children (see Laferre`re & Wolff 2006). Transfers are\na form of investment, like an investment into a portfolio,\nand the context of the investment is one in which\nparents anticipate that when they become old they will\nneed help. Parents thus invest now (e.g., education\nexpenses, gifts, loans) and in the future (promise of inheri-\ntance) to make their child behave altruistically toward\nthem in the future \u2013 an intertemporal exchange between\nself-interested parents and children.\nBoth altruistic and exchange models face a number of\nempirical challenges, and according to Arrondel and\nMasson (2006), several surveys of the evidence have\nemphasized both models\u2019 \u201cpoor empirical performance\u201d\n(p. 975). For the altruistic model, the challenges range\nfrom the empirical failure of the prediction that the\namount of transfer should decrease with a child\u2019s income\nif the property of redistributive neutrality holds, to the\nfact that altruistic parents should transfer their wealth\nmainly in the form of gifts when children with limited\nliquidity need them most, rather than much later through\nbequests (Arrondel & Masson 2006). For models of\nexchange, the crucial question is whether there exists a\nspecific quid pro quo (intertemporal) exchange. If so,\none would, for instance, expect that the levels of aid and\nattention that children give to their parents is positively\ncorrelated with their gift and inheritance expectations \u2013\na prediction for which there is, at best, mixed evidence\n(Arrondel & Masson 2006).\nFew economic models of the altruism and exchange\nvariety and beyond have explicitly considered grandparen-\ntal investment (e.g., Wolff 2000), or treated it differently\nfrom a replication of the parent\u2013child relationship.\nExchange concerns may make the transfer motive most\nsuitable for application to the grandparent\u2013parent and\ngrandparent\u2013grandchild relationships, respectively. But\nagain, there is little empirical evidence for a quid pro\nquo exchange. Using data from the German Aging\nSurvey, Hoff (2007), for example, found that extensive\nfinancial transfers from grandparents to grandchildren\nexisted, as did a small amount of instrumental support\nfrom grandchildren to grandparents; however, in only 10\nout of 371 (2.7%) cases was any exchange of resources\nevident. Only for the 80\u201385-year-old grandparents did\nthe proportion of grandchildren providing instrumental\nsupport to grandparents exceed the proportion receiving\nfinancial transfers from them. The relative value of these\ntime transfers is hard to evaluate (Arrondel & Masson\n2006) and may be crucial to the minority of grandparents\nthat receives them; however, it is clearly outweighed by\nthe preceding decades of their investment.5\n4.2. The sociological view: Values, norms, and\ninstitutions\nIn sociology, the influential modernization paradigm has\nstressed the emergence of the nuclear family and the\nparallel weakening of bonds beyond the nuclear family.\nProbably owing to these predictions, the topic of grandpar-\nental investment has received scant attention from sociol-\nogists (Kohli 2004). This, however, changed in the closing\nyears of the twentieth century, when demographic\ndynamics and economic pressure on state-funded old-\nage pension systems put the topic of intergenerational\ntransfers and intergenerational solidarity (Monserud\n2008; Wood & Liossis 2007) on sociologists\u2019 scientific\nagenda. Since then, their inquiries have mostly turned to\nstructural factors, social institutions, and cultural values\nthat shape the process of intergenerational transfer. Struc-\ntural factors relate to macro-level properties, such as\nfemale participation in the labor force, or income and\nwealth distributions. Social institutions relevant for trans-\nfer concern, for instance, laws that regulate testamentary\nfreedom (e.g., in Germany the surviving spouse and chil-\ndren have a legal right to half of the estate, whereas in\nthe United States there are virtually no constraints on\nthe estate holder), and how wealth is taxed at death. Cul-\ntural values \u2013 underlying norms of reciprocity, family\nobligations, and responsibility \u2013 have been suggested as\nshaping intergenerational transfers (e.g., Finch & Mason\n1993). In a representative sample of the German popu-\nlation (the German Aging Survey), Kohli and Ku\u00a8nemund\n(2003), for example, observed that retirees (.55 years)\nwho agree to an unconditional solidarity norm (\u201cIf my\nfamily members need help, I will always be there\u201d) are\nmuch more likely to provide monetary transfers (to their\nkin during the 12 months prior to the survey) than those\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n8 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nwho espouse a strategic norm of direct reciprocity (\u201cIf I\nhelp my family members, I can expect help from them\nin return\u201d). Closely related to investigations of such\nnorms are studies of the different roles that grandparents\ncan adopt (Kivett 1993), and the meaning of (Werner et al.\n1998) and satisfaction with (Reitzes & Mutran 2004) these\nroles.\nAs of now, the sociological inquiries have yielded a rich\nrepertoire of empirical findings. On the one hand, it seems\nfair to say that this wealth of findings has not been born out\nof a strong theoretical framework, nor has it culminated in\none, notwithstanding repeated calls from within sociology,\nand its crossover with psychology, for a theoretical syn-\nthesis (Smith & Drew 2002; 2004; Szinovacz 1998b). On\nthe other hand, sociologists\u2019 emphasis on variables and\ntheoretical constructs (e.g., values and norms) that evol-\nutionary researchers tend to neglect has revealed a\nnumber of key robust properties of intergenerational\ntransfer and solidarity. Among these are the following:\nFirst, intergenerational support is not only a function of\nneeds and the availability of resources, but also of the\ndonor\u2019s (e.g., grandparent\u2019s) norms and values system\n(e.g., unconditional vs. conditional solidarity). Second,\nthe development of public welfare systems \u2013 most pro-\nfoundly implemented in European societies \u2013 has not\ncrowded out support from beyond the nuclear family:\nThere is a net flow of material resources from retirees to\ntheir adult children and grandchildren (Albertini et al.\n2007). Third, for monetary resources, welfare state pro-\nvision appears to enable rather than crowd out transfers\n(Attias-Donfut et al. 2005); furthermore, transfers in\nEuropean countries to some extent depend on countries\u2019\nwelfare regimes (e.g., Albertini et al. 2007). Fourth, com-\nparative analyses, for instance, between East and West\nGermany, have demonstrated that transfers from the\nelderly to their children occur even under unfavorable\neconomic conditions (Kohli 2004).\nLacking an encompassing theoretical framework of\ngrandparental investment, sociologists have made steps\ntoward such a framework. One such step is the recent\nrational grandparent model (Friedman et al. 2008). It\ndepicts grandparents as rational actors who use their\nrelationship with their grandchildren as a conduit to a reci-\nprocal relationship with the grandchildren\u2019s parents. That\nis, grandparents attempt to reduce the agonizing uncer-\ntainty regarding their quality of life in old age by investing\ndifferentially in the children of that child most likely, in the\ngrandparent\u2019s perception, to reciprocate in the future. The\nmechanism assumed is that acts of investment in grand-\nchildren activate children\u2019s norms of reciprocity. Clearly,\nthis model shares aspects with other exchange theories\n(e.g., the indirect reciprocities model; Arrondel &\nMasson 2006), but it also makes a number of unique pre-\ndictions, some of which, however, are blatantly at odds\nwith evolutionary theory, others with currently available\nevidence. For example, the model predicts, contrary to\nthe kin altruism account of grandparental investment,\nthat grandparents are indifferent as to whether their\ngrandchildren are related to them or not (i.e., adopted).\nThe model also assumes that to overcome the potential dif-\nfusion of responsibility among their children, grandpar-\nents must make investments \u201cdemonstrably and publicly\ndifferential\u201d (Friedman et al. 2008, p. 42; these authors\u2019\nemphasis). Such favoritism, however, is in conflict with\nboth the parents\u2019 espoused value of equal treatment of\nchildren in egalitarian societies (Zervas & Sherman\n1994) and the \u201cequal division puzzle\u201d (Bernheim & Sever-\ninov 2000); that is, the consistent observation that today\u2019s\nbequests are to a large extent distributed equally across\nall children within a family.\n4.3. An alternative Darwinian view: Evolutionary\ncontinuity and the empathy mechanism\nRecent years have seen sustained challenges to the stan-\ndard categories of altruistic motivations in evolutionary\ntheory and economics. According to those, people desire\nto enhance the welfare of others at a net welfare loss to\nthemselves because they are related to those others (kin\naltruism); or because they expect future material benefits\nin repeated interactions (reciprocal altruism); or because\nthey are concerned about building a reputation (repu-\ntation-based cooperation). Two bodies of evidence have\nchallenged the sufficiency of these categories. The first\nbody of evidence, gathered by experimental economists\nand psychologists, suggests that a substantial portion of\npeople are strongly motivated by \u201cother-regarding prefer-\nences\u201d and are guided by concerns for fairness that cannot\nbe easily reduced to the \u201cweak reciprocity\u201d that is motiv-\nated by long-term self-interest in repeated interactions.\nPerhaps the most famous social game challenging the\nweak reciprocity view is the Ultimatum Game (Gu\u00a8th et al.\n1982). In its simplest form, the Ultimatum Game involves\na single round in which one person (the proposer) proposes\nto split a fixed pie (say $100). The proposed split represents\nan ultimatum to the other person, the responder, whomust\naccept or reject it. If the proposed distribution is accepted,\nit will be implemented. A rejection, however, results\nin a default payment \u2013 typically zero \u2013 for each player.\nBecause of the extreme asymmetry in available actions,\nthe equilibrium for this game involves very asymmetric\npayoffs: If the responder is self-regarding, she will accept\nany positive payoff in excess of the default value, even an\noffer of $1, because it is better than nothing. Knowing\nthis, a self-regarding proposer will offer just that, $1. This\nprediction hinges on the assumption that the responder is\nrational and acts in a self-regarding manner, and that the\nproposer is convinced that the responder is rational and\nwill act in a self-regarding manner. Conflicting with this\nprediction, a robust result in the Ultimatum Game, across\nhundreds of experiments, is that the vast majority of the\noffers to the responders are between 40 and 50% of the\navailable pie (Fehr & Schmidt 2006). Moreover, those pro-\nposals that offer the responder less than 20% of the pie are\nrejected with a substantial probability.\nThe most influential interpretation of this behavior \u2013\nwhich conflicts with the assumption made routinely by\nmost economists (see Fehr & Schmidt 2006) that material\nself-interest is the sole motivation of all people \u2013 has been\nin terms of altruistic punishment (Fehr & Ga\u00a8chter 2002).\nAltruistic punishment means that individuals punish\nunfair and uncooperative behavior, notwithstanding the\nfact that the punishment is costly for them and yields no\nmaterial gain. In the Ultimatum Game, the proposer is\nassumed to anticipate the risk of altruistic punishment \u2013\nboth responder and proposer will receive nothing if the\nresponder rejects the allocation \u2013 and thus offers a more\nequitable distribution than the equilibrium solution\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 9\nsuggests. The threat of altruistic punishment of defectors\nhas been suggested as a key condition of why humans,\nunlike other animals, are able to frequently cooperate\nwith genetically unrelated strangers (i.e., no kin altruism),\noften in large groups, with people they will never meet\nagain (i.e., no reciprocal altruism), and when reputation\ngains are small or absent (no reputation-based cooper-\nation). Although altruistic punishment may be selectively\ndisadvantageous at the individual level, it may be selec-\ntively advantageous at the group level (Wilson & Wilson\n2007), and thus could be the glue that keeps human\nsocieties together (e.g., Fehr & Ga\u00a8chter). Moreover,\nneuro-scientific evidence indicates that, first, negative\nemotions towards defectors and, second, hedonic res-\nponses in reward-related brain areas when people\ncooperate or punish others for violations of widely accep-\nted social norms (e.g., de Quervain et al. 2004; Sanfey et al.\n2003) are the proximate mechanisms behind altruistic\npunishment.\nEthologists, primatologists, and psychologists have\ngathered the second body of evidence challenging the tra-\nditional categories of altruism. It suggests that precursory\nelements of key aspects of human moral behavior and\nother-regarding preferences, such as empathy, sympathy,\nconsolation, perspective taking, theory of mind, and a\nsense of fairness, also exist in our closest primate relatives.\nDe Waal (2006), in particular, has attacked what he calls\nthe \u201cveneer theory,\u201d according to which human morality\nis merely a fragile cultural layer, scarcely concealing the\nbrutish natural tendencies that we have in common with\nother species. In contrast, he has argued that morality\nhas evolved gradually in our forebears, especially in the\ngreat apes. The possibility of other-regarding preferences\nin nonhuman primates has triggered numerous fascinating\nstudies of primates, and a heated debate. Some of these\nstudies clearly support the notion of an evolutionary con-\ntinuity between humans and primates with regard to\ncrucial aspects of altruism (e.g., Brosnan & de Waal\n2003; Brosnan et al. 2005; Burkart et al. 2007; de Waal\net al. 2008; Warneken et al. 2007), whereas others cast\ndoubt on the existence of profound other-regarding pre-\nferences among primates in general and specifically in\ncontexts involving food acquisition and distribution (e.g.,\nJensen et al. 2006; Silk et al. 2005; Vonk et al. 2007).\nPossibly the single most important aspect of both of\nthese roiling debates over the origins and the nature of\nhuman altruism for grandparental investment is the evol-\nution of empathy. In several publications, de Waal\n(2008; Preston & de Waal 2002) has proposed empathy\nto be a candidate mechanism that underlies directed altru-\nism, which is altruistic behavior in response to another\u2019s\npain, need, or distress. On this view, evolution may have\nselected empathy in animals as the main proximate mech-\nanism to generate directed altruism. The mechanism,\nhowever, is not in opposition to the ultimate causes of be-\nhavior, but empathy-based altruistic acts are allocated in\naccordance with kin and reciprocal altruism theory (de\nWaal 2008, p. 279).\nThe empathy-mechanism thesis highlights the distinc-\ntion between ultimate and proximate causes of behavior\n(Mayr 1961). Proximate mechanisms have received scant\nattention, with the kin altruism explanations of grandpar-\nental investment focusing instead on the investments\u2019 ulti-\nmate causes (reproductive success; section 2). According\nto de Waal\u2019s (2008) argument, the ultimate benefits of\naltruistic acts could be quite time-delayed, and thus\nunable to provide the motivational force necessary to\nimplement acts of directed altruism. Empathy in terms\nof a rapid emotional connectedness mechanism, however,\ncould bridge the gap between altruistic acts now and ulti-\nmate reproductive success benefits in the future. The core\nof the empathic capacity lies in the access that an organism\ngains to the subjective state of another organism through\nthe subject\u2019s own neural and body representation. The\nmechanism works so well because it gives individuals an\nemotional stake in the welfare of others.\nHow did the empathy mechanism evolve? De Waal\n(2008) suggests that it \u201clikely started in the context of par-\nental care long before our species evolved\u201d and \u201conce the\nempathic capacity existed it could be applied outside the\nrearing context and play a role in the wider network of\nsocial relationships\u201d (p. 282). Via the empathy mechanism,\nde Waal puts altruism back into altruism. Analogously, via\nthe empathy mechanism one could also put altruism back\ninto grandparental altruism. That is, the proximate cause\nfor why grandparents care for the welfare of their children\nand grandchildren is not that they bet on return benefits of\naltruistic behavior, but may lie in their capacity for\nempathy, or in Hrdy\u2019s (2009) term, in humans\u2019 hypersoci-\nality. Empathy alerts them to their kin\u2019s needs, helps them\nto identify emotionally with them, and provides them\nwith psychological benefits (e.g., satisfaction) from giving\nsupport.\n4.4. Conclusion\nWhat can we do with the multiple theoretical views on\naltruism in general and human grandparental investment\nin particular? In our view, the task for the future must\nnot be to play them off against each other and declare\none the winner. Grandparental investment can be analyzed\nand explained on multiple levels of description. Kin altru-\nism, with its focus on fitness consequences, is key in under-\nstanding its evolution and in identifying a set of variables\n(Table 1) that explain some of the observed variance in\ngrandparental investments. Kin-based accounts, however,\nhave passed over the proximal causes, and left unregarded\nthe motivational engine behind grandparents\u2019 altruistic\nacts. Even if, in the case of grandparental investment,\nthere is no long delay between altruistic grandparental\nacts (e.g., babysitting) and their reproductive success, the\nquestion is whether grandparents muster their continuous\nmotivation to care for their family\u2019s welfare by contemplat-\ning progeny or by proximate motivational mechanisms that\nare robust and disconnected from its ultimate goal.\nJust as de Waal\u2019s new Darwinian view stresses proximate\nmotivational mechanisms, sociological theories can be seen\nas revealing proximate motivational mechanisms by explain-\ning how individuals\u2019 norms and values (e.g., conditional vs.\nunconditional altruism) affect the degree to which a grand-\nparent cares. Moreover, interindividual differences in\nnorms and values can help to discern which grandparents\nare better modeled in terms of the Barro\u2013Becker kind of\naltruism and which grandparents can be modeled as partak-\ning in a strategic bargaining game. Relatedly, the emotional\nconnectedness mechanism or empathy mechanism could\nprovide the psychological foundation for the Barro\u2013\nBecker kind of parental and grandparental altruism.\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n10 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nBeyond these proximate levels, the sociological and\neconomic theories consider grandparental investment\nand intergenerational transfers from a macro perspective\nthat is missing in all Darwinian accounts. How are grand-\nparental investments influenced by institutional arrange-\nments (e.g., laws of inheritance)? Does a state-financed\nwelfare system crowd out grandparental investment? An\ninstitutional perspective also highlights that intergenera-\ntional transfers are not necessarily unidirectional. To the\nextent that public pension systems are (partly) financed\nthrough a pay-as-you-go scheme (e.g., Germany; Bo\u00a8rsch-\nSupan & Miegel 2001), enormous tangible resources are\nalso transferred from younger to older generations.\nAll of the theoretical views are valuable insofar as they\nfocus on, analyze, and explain important yet different\naspects of grandparental investment. Yet, at the same\ntime, each view is deficient because of its narrow focus.\nLike in the Indian tale of the blind men and the ele-\nphant \u2013 in which each blind man touches a different\npart, but only one part, say, the tusk, to learn what the\nelephant is like, thus arriving at very different descriptions\nof the animal \u2013 each approach considers one of several\naspects: ultimate causes, proximate mechanisms, values\nor institutions, welfare regimes, and so on. The task for\nthe near future is to seriously attend to the other disci-\nplines\u2019 views: Consider how rarely an article on grandpar-\nental investment published in an evolutionary journal cites\nsociological work, and vice versa. The task for the medium\nterm is to work toward a comprehensive framework that\nintegrates the different aspects of grandparental invest-\nments reviewed here. Such an integrative framework and\ninterdisciplinary research program is timely. The way par-\nental and grandparental investments, public and private\ntransfers are institutionally organized and incentivized\nwill be increasingly important in post-demographic tran-\nsition societies where human capital becomes an ever\nsmaller resource. Indeed, the link between grandparental\ninvestments and demographic trajectories is the topic of\nour next section.\n5. A paradoxical new world: So much to share, so\nlittle impact?\nAccording to demographic transition theory (e.g., Caldwell\net al. 2006), societies progress from a pre-modern regime\nof high fertility and high mortality (Stage 1) to a post-\nmodern regime of low fertility and low mortality (Stage\n4), and possibly, according to some theorists, to a Stage\n5, in which birth rates fall below death rates, thus\ncausing the population to decline (but, for more optimistic\nrecent findings, see Myrskyla\u00a8 et al. 2009). At this point,\nmost industrialized societies are in Stage 4, and most of\nthe radical demographic and social transformation has\noccurred over the last 150 years. A wide range of factors\nhas contributed to this transition, including progress in\nmedical science, technology, the rise in productivity and\nincome, the availability of contraceptive technologies,\nrising female participation in the labor market, increasing\ncosts of having children (e.g., education), and new values\nthat justify lower fertility, and even childlessness.\nThe conditions under which the beneficial role of\ngrandparents may have evolved are still maintained in\nthe few contemporary pre-industrialized small-scale\nsocieties that have not begun the demographic transition:\nshort life expectancy, high fertility and infant mortality,\nand the wealthy out-reproducing the poor. In contrast,\nin post-demographic transition societies life expectancy\nis long, fertility and infant mortality are low, and the\npoor now out-reproduce the wealthy (Borgerhoff Mulder\n1998; Lee 2003b). In what follows, we describe how\nthese demographic changes affect basic parameters of\ngrandparental investment in industrialized societies.\n5.1. Shared lifespan\nThe recent increase in human life expectancy has\nexpanded the shared lifespan between grandparents and\ngrandchildren, thus creating theoretically an ideal situ-\nation for grandparents to impact their grandchildren\u2019s\nwelfare. Using cohort-specific survival rates and age-at-\nfirst-birth data from Switzerland, Ho\u00a8pflinger et al. (2006)\nestimated that of the grandchildren who reached 20\nyears of age in 1900, 27% would have had one or more\nliving grandparents. This figure had risen to 92% in\n2000. At 35 years of age, only 1% of grandchildren\nwould have had at least one surviving grandparent in\n1900; in the year 2000, even at 35 years of age, 39% of\ngrandchildren would have had one or more surviving\ngrandparents (for U.S. data, see Uhlenberg 1996).\nHow will this trend continue in the future? Using mor-\ntality, fertility, and average age at first birth data for\nEngland and Wales, Murphy and Grundy (2003) esti-\nmated the proportion of people born between 1911 and\n2050 with living mothers and women with living children.\nFrom the grandparent\u2019s point of view, the future looks\nbright. A combination of the decline in age at first child-\nbirth to a low in the 1970s and steadily declining mortality\nrates means that 60% of 70-year-olds currently have two or\nmore living children and by extension, potentially grand-\nchildren. It is estimated that this proportion will remain\nabove 50% until at least 2030. From the grandchildren\u2019s\npoint of view, we may be about to leave a golden age of\nshared lifespan. A combination of an increasing age at\nfirst childbirth since the 1970s and a less marked decline\nin mortality rates means that it is more likely a mother\nwill be dead for a given age of her children (and grandchil-\ndren). Therefore, the proportion of adults with a living\nmother, and thus the proportion of grandchildren with a\nliving grandmother, has started to decline from those indi-\nviduals born around 1970. In terms of human history,\ngrandparents and grandchildren may currently be at the\nzenith of their shared lifespan.\nMore generally, even though the average age at first\nchildbirth is rising (Billari et al. 2007), and hence delaying\nthe onset of grandparenthood, in industrialized societies\nthe typical grandparent is young (relative to life expect-\nancy) and healthy (Manton et al. 2008). For example,\nSchwartz and Waldrop reported in 1992 that nearly 50%\nof grandparents in the United States were aged less than\n60 years, 33% less than 55 years, and only 20% older\nthan 70 years. Some have argued that healthier grandpar-\nents are more likely to be pursuing their own, perhaps\ncostly, interests outside their family (e.g., traveling).\nHowever, in industrialized societies, healthier and\nyounger grandparents have been found to invest more in\ntheir grandchildren (Ho\u00a8pflinger et al. 2006; see also\nEuler & Weitzel 1996), and to increase the chance of\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 11\ngrandchildren surviving in historical populations (Lahden-\npera\u00a8 et al. 2004).\n5.2. Low fertility rates\nAccording to Kohler and colleagues, \u201cThe majority of the\nworld\u2019s population is living in countries with near-replace-\nment or below-replacement fertility\u201d (Kohler et al. 2002,\np. 641). In Europe, for instance, Turkey is the only\ncountry among 46 countries studied where generation\nreplacement is guaranteed (with a fertility level higher\nthan 2.1 children in 2002; Council of Europe 2005). At\nthe turn of the millennium, 14 countries in Europe had\na total fertility rate below 1.3, which implies halving of\nthe stable population size every 45 years (Kohler et al.\n2002). As a consequence, the probability of becoming a\ngrandparent is falling, and those people who do become\ngrandparents are likely to have fewer biological grandchil-\ndren, relative to the past.\n5.3. Increased individual wealth and investment\nper child\nThe influence that grandparents, like parents, have on the\ndevelopment of grandchildren is largely dependent on\nresource availability (see Borgerhoff Mulder 2007;\nGibson & Mace 2005; Hadley 2004; Lawson & Mace\n2009). In industrialized societies, ensuring that descen-\ndants\u2019 skill base and wealth makes them competitive,\nmeans that the cost of raising children has increased expo-\nnentially (see Borgerhoff Mulder 1998; Kaplan 1996;\nMace 1998). Thus, even though low childhood mortality\nand fertility rates may translate into fewer, wealthier des-\ncendants, the need for grandparental investment may not\nnecessarily diminish. Rather, the increased cost of chil-\ndren may further exacerbate the demands on grandpar-\nents. Consistent with this interpretation, higher\nsocioeconomic status grandparents invest more in family\nmembers (Cao 2006) and show higher levels of affectual\nsolidarity with their grandchildren (Wood & Liossis\n2007). However, the aspect of socioeconomic status\nbeing investigated (e.g., income or education) and the\nform of investment being made (e.g., time or money)\nmay strongly influence the association between grandpar-\nental wealth and investment.\nIn industrialized societies, higher socioeconomic status\ngroups tend to delay reproduction. Even people who\nwant to have children often consciously delay reproduction\nto accumulate resources (Hammarberg & Clarke 2005).\nIncreasingly, people are turning to reproductive technol-\nogies to assist conception later in life (Oakley et al. 2008).\nThe fact, however, that most industrialized countries\ncannot match demand for fertility treatments (Hoorens\net al. 2007), and the increased risk of poorer outcomes\nfor the mother and child associated with such technologies\n(Fisher et al. 2005; Kalra, &Molinaro 2008),means that the\nprobability of becoming a grandparent continues to fall,\nand that those people who become grandparents may\nneed to provide especially high levels of investment.\nTo conclude, grandchildren and grandparents have never\nhad and may never again have more shared lifetime than\ntoday. Moreover, intergenerational transfers remain a\nrobust property of grandparent\u2013grandchild relationships\nin industrialized societies, although they are dependent on\na range of factors such as grandparents\u2019 socioeconomic\nstatus, their role within the family, grandparents\u2019 occu-\npational status, and the presence of elderly parents to care\nfor in addition to children and grandchildren (e.g., Attias-\nDonfut&Segalen 2002;Cooney&An2006).One likely con-\nsequence of the substantial increase in shared lifespan and\nthe lower birthrate is that the time, money, and affection\nthat grandparents invest is spread across fewer grandchil-\ndren, increasing the potential investment per grandchild.\nParadoxically, however, their investments are likely to be\nless beneficial than ever \u2013 at least when measured in\nterms of fitness consequences. Does that mean that grand-\nparental investment has become a vain endeavor?\n6. Grandparental investment in industrialized\nsocieties: Any evidence for beneficial effects under\nlow-risk conditions?\nLack of impact on classic fitness indicators in industrialized\nsocieties does not mean that grandparental investment has\nlost all significance. Rather, the question is on which other\ndimensions may one find evidence of potential benefits,\ninasmuch as they exist? Even in affluent societies, in\nwhich, typically, children receive medical care, do not\nstarve to death, and learn to read and write, childhood\nexperiences, for example, in terms of the availability of\nmonetary, cognitive, social, and emotional resources, vary\nenormously. Reflecting such variation in the United\nStates, the Gini coefficient \u2013 a classic tool for measuring\ninequality \u2013 climbed steadily from 0.395 in 1974 to 0.47\nin 2006, before dipping slightly to 0.463 in 2007. In\nBritain, the Gini (and thus inequality) has risen from 0.25\nin 1979 to 0.35 in 2006 (The Economist, April 2, 2009).\nIn light of heterogeneity in childhood experiences\nand grandparents\u2019 ability to provide a buffer against\npsychological and environmental challenges (Cohen &\nWills 1985; Uhlenberg 2009), one hypothesis is that the\nbeneficial effects of grandparental investments in industri-\nalized societies reside in \u201csofter\u201d dimensions, such as the\ngrandchildren\u2019s cognitive and verbal ability, mental\nhealth, and well-being. However, according to another\nhypothesis, it is far from clear whether the unique environ-\nments that grandparents experience in industrialized\nsocieties necessarily support the contact, family structures,\nand relationships that are available in contemporary tra-\nditional societies and historical populations (see, e.g.,\nDenham & Smith 1989). As a consequence, the impact\nof grandparents on children\u2019s development may lack a sys-\ntematic pattern and, literally, \u201cmay be beneficial, harmful,\nor neutral\u201d (Denham & Smith 1989, p. 348).\nTo evaluate which of these two hypotheses is more\nappropriate, we search for evidence in two stages. We\nfirst focus on the impact that grandparents have on the\ndevelopment of their grandchildren in low-risk family\ncontexts. Our goal is to determine those effects of grand-\nparental investment that emerge when no unusual risks\nshape the grandchild\u2019s development. Second, we turn\nto the effects of grandparental investment in two high-\nrisk family contexts, namely, teenage pregnancies and\nmaternal depression, and we aim to describe what may\nbe called the buffering effects of grandparental investment\nunder conditions of duress.\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n12 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\n6.1. Low-risk family contexts: Grandparental investment\nand the physical and mental well-being of children\nand grandchildren\nCould the beneficial influence of grandparents express itself\nin industrialized societies in terms of successful develop-\nment on various psychological dimensions? In search of\nan answer, we conducted a systematic review of the grand-\nparental investment literature. Empirical studies examining\nthe influence of grandparents on their grandchildren\nhave been conducted in sociology, psychology, medicine,\nbiology, economics, and education. To identify these\nstudies, we searched seven databases: PsychINFO (1970\u2013\n2007), Medline (1970\u20132007), ERIC (1970\u20132007), Socio-\nlogical Abstracts (1970\u20132007), EconLit (1970\u20132007),\nBiosis Preview (1980\u20132007), and ISI Web of Science\n(1970\u20132007), limiting the search to English-language\njournal articles. The same 11 searches were conducted in\neach database. The key words \u201cgrandparent\u201d and \u201cgrand-\nchild\u201d were searched in the title, abstract, and keywords\nfields in each database, in combination with terms focusing\non a range of measures reflecting childhood development:\n\u201cdevelopment,\u201d \u201cverbal ability,\u201d \u201cverbal scores,\u201d \u201cSAT\nscores,\u201d \u201cacademic performance,\u201d \u201cschool performance,\u201d\n\u201cgrade point average,\u201d \u201ccognitive performance,\u201d \u201ccognitive\nability,\u201d \u201cadjustment,\u201d and \u201cbehavioral development.\u201d This\nsearch was completed in December 2007.\nAll searches were cross-matched for duplication, yield-\ning 196 publications. We read the title and abstract of\neach study to identify those that could be relevant. If\nthere was any indication that grandparental investment\n(in terms of time, money, care, contact, etc.) in industrial-\nized societies was empirically studied, we read the com-\nplete article. We then culled this group, keeping only\nthose articles that (a) provided direct measures of grand-\nparental investment (rather than indiscriminate extended\nkinship investment), (b) provided direct measures of\nchild outcome (e.g., SAT scores, school performance,\ngrade point average, behavioral development), and (c)\ninvestigated a low-risk family context in industrialized\nsocieties. Because of the low-risk criterion, we excluded\nstudies involving three-generation households, households\nwhere grandparents were the primary caregivers, and\nhouseholds where the influence of grandparents was\nexamined following parental divorce \u2013 circumstances\nthat typically represent higher risk family situations, in\nwhich grandparents and their families are often disadvan-\ntaged themselves (Brandon et al. 2007; Lavers & Sonuga-\nBarke 1997). When one of the articles cited a study that\nappeared relevant, we looked it up and included it if the\nstudy met the described criteria; similarly, we looked up\nall studies that cited the article (using Web of Science).\nThis produced only 13 publications, and, of these,\nmerely four publications met all of our criteria: Tinsley\nand Parke (1987), Falbo (1991), Scholl Perry (1996), and\nFergusson et al. (2008).6 Three features of the literature\nmay account for why our search identified so few\nstudies. The first is that very few studies provide direct\nmeasures of grandparental investment, but focus instead\non outcomes, such as educational attainment as proxies\nfor grandparental investment. The second feature is that\nmany studies focus on co-residence, which occurs more\nfrequently with non-intact families (high-risk context),\nbut is generally low in countries such as the United\nStates (Hill 2006). Finally, many studies investigate the\nimpact of help from the broad category \u201cother adults,\u201d\nrather than specifically grandparents (e.g., Runyan et al.\n1998; Surkan et al. 2007). We now turn in more detail to\nthe few relevant studies that we retrieved.\n6.1.1. Infant physical and mental development. Tinsley\nand Parke (1987) investigated measures of physical and\nmental development as a function of the frequency of grand-\nparent\u2013grandchild contacts in a sample of 30 seven-month-\nold Caucasian infants and their families in theUnited States.\nAll of the infants were healthy and none of the grandparents\nwere daily caregivers to their grandchildren, lived in the\nsame household, considered themselves retired, or lived\nmore than 50 miles (80 km) away from their grandchildren.\nEach parent and grandparent was observed playing with the\ninfant for five minutes, and adult\u2013infant interaction and\nadult global behaviors were rated. To measure grand-\nparental investment, parents completed a social support\nquestionnaire and grandparents completed a questionnaire\nmeasuring their contact (frequency) with their grand-\nchildren. Finally, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development,\nadministered on a separate home visit, measured the\ninfant\u2019s mental and physical development.\nTable 2 shows the statistically significant relationships\nbetween grandparent\u2013infant patterns of interaction and\ninfant development scores, and reports the effect size\nmeasure eta2 (h2). First, grandchildren whose grandpar-\nents engaged in more stimulating and engaging behavior\nhad higher Bayley scores across both the physical and\nmental domains (only significant effects were reported).\nAll significant effects were positive and of a large size.\nSecond, infants who had high levels of contact with their\ngrandparents had higher Bayley Mental Development\nIndex scores compared with infants with low contact\n(h2 \u00bc 0.148 and 0.146, respectively). There was no influ-\nence, however, on the Bayley physical development scales.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Tinsley and Parke (1987)\nwere the first to show that more stimulating and interactive\nplay and more contact with grandmothers and grand-\nfathers (but without differentiating between lineages)\nhave positive influences on infant mental development.\nHowever, from their study, it is not possible to distinguish\nbetween direct influences of grandparenting and indirect\ninfluences via parenting (see Bridges et al. 2007), and\nthus to distinguish between predictions from the good-\nmother and grandmother hypotheses. In sum, these\nresults document a suggestive, not necessarily causal,\nassociation between grandparents\u2019 behaviors and infant\nmental development that deserves further investigation.\n6.1.2. Academic achievement. In a sample of 1,460\nChinese grandchildren, Falbo (1991) analyzed the relation-\nship between grandparent\u2013grandchild contact and the\nchild\u2019s language and mathematics test scores during\nprimary school. The quality of contact was measured in\nterms of the frequency of contact (three-point scale from\n\u201crarely together\u201d to \u201coften together\u201d), multiplied by each\ngrandparent\u2019s highest educational attainment (seven-point\nscale from \u201cilliterate\u201d to \u201cgraduate degree\u201d). For both\nlanguage and mathematics across all types of grandparents,\nFalbo found a positive relationship of small effect size\n(r2 \u00bc .01\u2013.05). However, because contact with grandpar-\nents and grandparents\u2019 education were not separated, and\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 13\ngrandchildren from nuclear and three-generation families\nwere examined together, it is unclear how much of this\neffect reflects grandparental investment.\nScholl Perry (1996) also investigated the influence of\ngrandparental investment on academic achievement in\nan ethnically diverse sample of 75 middle-upper class\nadolescents (14\u201317 years of age) from New York State.\nGrandparental investment was measured in terms of the\ngrandparent\u2013grandchild contact (frequency), their emo-\ntional closeness, and social distance. Children\u2019s academic\nachievement was measured through students\u2019 self-reported\ngrade point average. The main results were: First, the\nsocial distance to grandfathers, but not grandmothers, was\nassociated with grade point average. Specifically, students\nwho reported a larger social distance between themselves\nand their paternal grandfather had higher grade point\naverages (d \u00bc 0.95). Conversely, there was a trend towards\nthe opposite effect in maternal grandfathers: Smaller social\ndistance was associated with higher grade point average\n(d \u00bc 0.62; Cohen\u2019s d is interpreted as a standardized mean\ndifference between two scores of a small [0.2], medium\n[0.5], or large [0.8] size; see Cohen 1988).\nScholl Perry\u2019s (1996) analysis suggests that grandfathers\nfrom different lineages may have different influences on\ntheir grandchild\u2019s academic achievement, consistent with\na matrilateral kin bias predicted by evolutionary theorizing\n(see Table 1). Moreover, grandchildren\u2019s reported social\ndistance mirrored the predicted role of grandparents\u2019\nlineage and gender, with the smallest reported social dis-\ntance (closest) to maternal grandmothers, followed by\nmaternal grandfathers, then paternal grandmothers, and\nthe largest social distance to paternal grandfathers.\nHowever, the lack of an association between social dis-\ntance to grandmothers and grade point average does not\nsupport the grandmother hypothesis. These small sets of\neffects are suggestive at best. They are, however, consist-\nent with the evidence of the benefit to academic and\nwork adjustment that teenagers gain from extended\nkinship support, including grandparents (see Kenny\net al. 2003; Pallock & Lamborn 2006).\n6.1.3. Behavioral and emotional adjustment. Using data\nfrom 8,752 families in the Avon Longitudinal Study of\nParents and Children, Fergusson et al. (2008) explored\nwhether childcare provided by grandparents was associ-\nated with emotional\/behavioral problems in their grand-\nchild at four years of age. The grandchild\u2019s behavior was\nassessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Question-\nnaire (SDQ) and was completed by the parent. Grandchil-\ndren who received childcare from their grandparents at 8,\n15, and 24 months of age, compared with those who\nreceived no grandparental care, were 28% more likely to\nscore high on the hyperactivity subscale of the SDQ.\nThis effect remained after adjustment for a range of demo-\ngraphic and family factors. Using the SDQ scores as con-\ntinuous variables, Fergusson et al. (2008) found that\ncompared with grandchildren with no grandparental\ninvolvement, those who received grandparental care at\nall three time points had slightly elevated levels of all beha-\nviors with effect sizes \u201cranging from d \u00bc .01 (prosocial be-\nhaviour) to d \u00bc .17 (hyperactivity)\u201d (p. 165). Clearly, this\nstudy highlights the fact that grandparental care is not a\npanacea, and future studies are needed to examine the\nstability of this pattern and to better understand the\nTable 2. Relationships between grandparent\u2013infant interaction patterns (median split) and infant development scores (adapted from\nTinsley & Parke 1987)a\nGrandparent\u2013infant dyad\nObserved grandparent\u2013infant\ninteraction patterns Infant development scoreb (effect sizec)\nGrandmother\u2013infant\nHigher positive verbalizations Higher Bayley raw Mental Health Index (h2 \u00bc 0.138)\nHigher demonstrating without a toy Higher Bayley raw (h2 \u00bc 0.184) and adjusted Physical Health\nIndex (h2 \u00bc 0.173)\nMore kissing Higher Bayley raw (h2 \u00bc 0.155) and adjusted Physical Health\nIndex (h2 \u00bc 0.143)\nHighly imaginative Higher Bayley raw and adjusted Physical Health Index (both\nh2 \u00bc 0.190 or greater)\nHighly confident Higher Bayley adjusted Physical Health Index (h2 \u00bc 0.164)\nGrandfather\u2013infant\nHighly responsive Higher Bayley raw and adjusted Physical Health Index (all\nh2 \u00bc 0.144 or greater)\nHighly playful Higher Bayley raw and adjusted Physical Health Index (all\nh2 \u00bc 0.144 or greater)\naUnfortunately, only those relationships found to be statistically significant were presented in the original text and are reproduced here. It is\nlikely that a broad range of unreported small and medium effects also exist.\nbThe Bayley Scales of Infant Development measured infant mental and physical development across cognitive, motor, and behavioral domains.\nThis produced four scores: (a) a raw score on the Bayley Mental Scale, (b) an adjusted Bayley Mental Development Index, (c) a raw score on the\nBayley Physical Scale, and (d) an adjusted Bayley Physical Development Index.\ncThe original text reported the F statistics, therefore the effect size calculated was eta2 (h2; Cohen 1965, p. 105). Eta2 can be interpreted as the\nproportion of variance in the dependent variable that is attributable to each effect (h2; small [0.01], medium [0.06], and large [0.14] effects;\nCohen 1988):\nh2 \u00bc F\n\u0002dfeffect\nF\u0002dfeffect \u00fe dferror\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n14 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nprocesses contributing it. Moreover, if different types of\ngrandparents are inclined to invest differently in their\ngrandchildren, examining all grandparents together may\nbe masking the range of influences grandparental care\ncan have on grandchild development.\n7. Grandparental investment in industrialized\nsocieties: Any evidence for beneficial effects under\nconditions of duress?\nOrdinarily, in intact families, the father is the prime candi-\ndate to provide support for the mother, followed by the\nmaternal grandmother (Hyun et al. 2002; Levitt et al.\n1986). However, it is under conditions of duress, when\nfathers are less likely to be available, that grandparents\nprovide the most valuable help to their children and grand-\nchildren (e.g., Botcheva & Feldman 2004; Kellam et al.\n1977; Leonetti et al. 2005; Oyserman et al. 1993). It is not\nsurprising therefore that much of the research on effects\nof grandparental investment in industrialized societies has\nfocused on the high-risk contexts of adolescent parenthood\n(e.g., Burton 1990), parental incarceration (e.g., Poehlmann\n2005), children born prematurely or of low birth weight\n(e.g., Gordon et al. 2004), children with a disability (e.g.,\nMitchell 2007), and drug use and abuse by parents and chil-\ndren (e.g., Burton 1992; Robbins et al. 2006). In many of\nthese high-risk situations grandparents assume the role of\nprimary caregiver, which puts considerable strain on them\nand their family, and often results in poor outcomes for\nthe grandparent.7 Reviewing these many studies across\ndifferent cultures is beyond the scope of this article.\nWe focus instead on two high-risk conditions, teenage\npregnancy and maternal depression.\n7.1. Teenage pregnancy\nFor good reason, themajority of teenage pregnancy studies\nfocus on grandmother\u2013mother\u2013grandchild co-residence\nand its consequences. Co-residence represents a high-\nrisk situation. Generally, grandparental co-residence is\nmore common when the teenage mother is younger\n(Black & Nitz 1996), and when the grandparent is\nyounger and has multiple responsibilities, including work\nand family commitments (Fuller-Thomson 2005; Moore\n& Brooks-Gunn 2002). Moreover, grandparental co-resi-\ndence does not necessarily ensure that children and grand-\nchildren receive higher levels of care (Lee et al. 2005).\nThemost common source of support for teenagemothers\nis their own mothers, the soon-to-be \u2013 if not already \u2013\ngrandmothers (Tolson&Wilson 1990). Support fromgrand-\nparents, particularly grandmothers, can have a beneficial\neffect on young teenagemothers and their children\u2019s adjust-\nment and development (e.g., Apfel & Seitz 1991; Pope et al.\n1993; Stevens 1988).On the other hand, evidence also shows\na negative influence of grandparental co-residence on\nteenage mothers and their children (e.g., Chase-Lansdale\net al. 1994; Scho\u00a8lmerich et al. 2005). These negative\neffects seem to arise especially where the grandparent\u2013\ngrandchild co-residence (a) occurs under conditions of\npoor family cohesion (Kalil et al. 1998), (b) is over an\nextended period of time (Black & Nitz 1996), (c) occurs\nwhen the mother is older (Black et al. 2002), or (d) occurs\nwhen there are high levels of grandparental care that may\nbe considered intrusive or may limit the development of\nautonomy (Spieker & Bensley 1994; Tomlin 1998). Taken\ntogether, these findings suggest that it is most likely that\ngrandmothers have a beneficial effect when they help\nrather than completely take over the mother\u2019s role or take\nno part in the grandchild\u2019s life (Tinsley & Parke 1984).\n7.2. Maternal depression\nBy 2020, depression is predicted to be second only to\nischemic heart disease as the worldwide leading cause of\nyears of life lost from premature death and or disability\n(Murray & Lopez 1997). From the grandchild\u2019s point of\nview, adversities early in life \u2013 for instance, the disruption\nof kinship networks, and the concomitant loss of social\nsupport and material security \u2013 contribute to an increased\nrisk of developing depression (Korkeila et al. 2005; Strassman\n&Dunbar 1999). Maternal depression represents such a dis-\nruption of the family network. Individuals whose mother is\ndepressed are at a higher risk of developing depression them-\nselves (e.g., Weissman et al. 2006). Can grandparents in\ngeneral and a high-quality relationship with one of their\ngrandparents in particular attenuate this risk?\nConducting (in January 2008) the same literature search\nstructure as detailed previously, but using the additional\nkey word \u201cdepression,\u201d produced 63 studies. We found\nmerely one study that examined the degree to which cohe-\nsion in grandchild\u2013grandparent relationships buffered\ngrandchildren against depressive symptoms. Silverstein\nand Ruiz (2006) analyzed data from 2,280 grandchildren\nand their mothers who participated in two waves of a\nnationally representative U.S. sample. Parents (at t1) and\nchildren (at t2, when they were 18\u201334 years old) reported\nthe frequency with which they had experienced depressive\nsymptoms in the past week. Cohesion in the grandchild\u2013\ngrandparent relationship was measured in terms of\nchildren\u2019s responses to questions regarding emotional clo-\nseness, frequency of contact, and ability to confide (when\nthey were 10\u201323 years old). Children were divided into\nthree groups, with weak, moderate, and strong cohesion.\nAfter controlling for numerous variables, such as parental\nincome and marital history, Silverstein and Ruiz found\nthat maternal depression (at t1) was \u201ctransmitted to grand-\nchildren with weak and moderately strong ties to grand-\nparents [adjusted r2 \u00bc 0.017 and 0.015, respectively],\nbut not to those with the strongest ties [adjusted\nr2 \u00bc 0.001]\u201d (Silverstein & Ruiz 2006, p. 608).\nThis longitudinal study suggests that strong ties with\ngrandparents can help to attenuate the risk of intergenera-\ntional transfer of maternal depression. This possibility\nraises the question of how robust this buffering effect is\nacross other disruptions of the family network due to a\nparent suffering from psychiatric or psychological dis-\norders (e.g., addiction), parental separation, or death. A\nrecent study by Attar-Schwartz et al. (2009), which came\nto our attention after our literature search had been con-\ncluded, showed that a buffering effect could be particu-\nlarly valuable when the structure of the nuclear family is\nchanged. In a representative sample of 1,515 adolescents\nfrom England andWales, the authors examined the associ-\nation between degree of grandparental involvement (from\nthe \u201cclosest grandparent\u201d) and adolescents\u2019 behavioral and\nemotional adjustment as a function of three family struc-\ntures: two-parent biological families, lone-parent families,\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 15\nand families with one step-parent. A higher degree of\ngrandparental involvement, which did not differ across\nfamily structures, was strongly associated with reduced\nadjustment problems among adolescents from lone-\nparent and step-parent families. Parallel beneficial\neffects, although mostly in the same direction, were not\nsignificant for two-parent biological families. Taken\ntogether, these observations suggest that the support of\nemotionally involved grandparents can be an important\nprotective resource for their grandchildren.\n8. Public health and policy implications of\ngrandparental investment\nOur interdisciplinary literature search showed a striking\npaucity of studies investigating contemporary, low-risk popu-\nlations in industrialized societies. The evidence, although\nlimited and not without warning signs, does suggest that in\nindustrialized societies grandparents can promote the\ngrowth and development of their grandchildren. The chal-\nlenge for policy makers is to create family environments\nand institutions where the potential grandparental resources\ncan be harnessed. However, to this end, researchers must\naddress the palpable gaps in the literature. Beyond the\nadmittedly trite call for more research, we now highlight\nissues that we consider crucial in a future research program\non grandparental investment: Specifically, we discuss the\nrole of grandparents as public health targets, examine\nshort- and long-term reciprocal health benefits that grand-\nparental investments may have for the donors, and conclude\nby discussing the link between fertility and grandparental\ninvestment in European societies.\n8.1. Grandparents as public health targets: Future\nresearch\nEquipped with expertise and the motivation to share it,\ngrandmothers in non-Western and indigenous societies\nhave been targets of public health promotion to great\neffect: increasing birth weight in Australia (d\u2019Espaignet\net al. 2003), improving breast-feeding practices in Cambo-\ndia (Crookston et al. 2007), or improving nutritional knowl-\nedge in young mothers (Aubel 2005). Grandparents also\nfunction as health educators in industrialized societies\n(Watson et al. 2005), and it has been proposed that\ninterventions target the resources grandparents bring\nto families (see Denham & Smith 1989). Our empirical\nreview suggests that the socio-emotional support grandpar-\nents provide is key to understanding how grandparental\ninvestment may influence grandchildren in industrialized\nsocieties. Evolutionary theory suggests maternal grandpar-\nents are most inclined to help, especially the maternal\ngrandmother, and demographic data suggest that she is\nmost likely available. Hence, one policy approach informed\nfrom an evolutionary framework is to target phenomena\nwhere the mother\u2019s family is likely to have an influence\nand that are influenced by socio-emotional support. Next,\nwe illustrate two such phenomena.\n8.1.1. Breast-feeding. The quintessential form of parental\ninvestment \u2013 breast-feeding \u2013 is recognized as providing\nhealth benefits for children in both developed and develop-\ning nations (e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics 1997;\nHoddinott et al. 2008; Victora & WHO Collaborative\nStudy Team 2000; WHO\/UNICEF 1990). Female rela-\ntives, especially grandmothers, influence the duration and\nexclusivity of breast-feeding through their childcare, baby-\nsitting, support, encouragement, experience, and the trans-\nmission of cultural values (Bentley et al. 1999; Ekstro\u00a8m\net al. 2003; Ingram et al. 2002). For these reasons, research-\ners have called for grandmothers to be targeted as potential\nsupport people (Banks 2003; Bentley et al. 2003; Black et al.\n2001; Ingram et al. 2003; Masvie 2006).\nThis support, however, is not uniformly positive. For\nexample, sometimes the grandmotherly advice creates con-\nflict, as it can be inconsistent with current best health prac-\ntices (Bentley et al. 2003; Duong et al. 2005). Once well\ninformed, however, grandparents appear to be willing to\nchange and integrate new health information with their\npre-existing knowledge (Aubel 2005; Aubel et al. 2004).\nIngram et al. (2003), for instance, aimed to help grand-\nmothers from Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Indian commu-\nnities living in Bristol, England, to support exclusive\nbreast-feeding by their daughters and daughters-in-law.\nThe focus on this group was because of low exclusive\nbreast-feeding rates (Thomas & Avery 1997), and the inter-\nvention was shown both to improve the grandmother\u2019s\nknowledge about breast-feeding and to increase the\nmother\u2019s breast-feeding rate.\n8.1.2. Postpartum depression. According to one adapta-\ntionist hypothesis for postpartum depression (PPD),\nwhich afflicts 10 to 15 percent of new mothers, PPD\nmay have evolved as a strategic response to a lack of\nsocial support (Hagen 1999). Specifically, problems with\nthe pregnancy, delivery, or infant, and perceived lack of\nthe social support necessary to raise a baby appear to be\nclosely associated with PPD (Beck 2001; O\u2019Hara &\nSwain 1996). Mothers suffering from PPD reduce their\ninvestment in their new baby (see Hagen [1999] for a\nreview of the evidence). Few interventions, except for\nthe intensive postpartum support from a health pro-\nfessional, seem to reduce the symptoms of PPD (Dennis\n2005). Although there are indications that grandparents\ncould provide the social support necessary to reduce the\nsymptoms of postpartum depression (Shanok & Miller\n2007), to the best of our knowledge, there are no detailed\nanalyses of this potentially beneficial mental health impact.\nLet us conclude with a cautionary note. The presence of\ngrandparents is not a fail-safe remedy. There is likely to be\nno simple relationship between grandparental presence\nand the incidence or outcome of breast-feeding or post-\npartum depression. The quality of the grandparent\u2013\nparent relationship is likely to be an important moderator.\nIf the grandparent\u2013mother relationship is confrontational\nor demanding, a grandparent\u2019s involvement may actually\nexacerbate a mother\u2019s depression (Hess et al. 2002). This\nsuggests that a research program on grandparental invest-\nment stands to benefit from exploring the determinants of\ngrandparental investment, such as type of grandparent,\nidentified within an evolutionary framework (see\nTable 1), and values, norms, and satisfaction with grand-\nparental roles, identified within a sociological framework.\n8.2. Grandparental investment: A one-way street?\nIn our aging societies, it is increasingly important also to\nconsider the benefits that grandchildren can provide for\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n16 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\ngrandparents (beyond increased fitness), especially grand-\nparental health, rather than focusing exclusively on the\nreversed relationship. What could such benefits be? One\nobvious benefit that follows immediately from the view\nthat grandparental investment is an intertemporal\nexchange between self-interested grandparents, parents,\nand grandchildren is that grandparents who have cared\nfor their grandchildren may be more likely to receive\nsupport from them or their parents in times of need (Fried-\nman et al. 2008; Stack 1975). Such help matters. Esbensen\net al. (2007) showed that direct support from grandchildren\ncould improve a grandparent\u2019s health during times of\nsevere physical illness. Relatedly, in a study of 2,200 older\nJapanese people, Okabayashi et al. (2004) found that, in\nthose individuals who did not have a spouse (n \u00bc 677),\nsocial support from children and grandchildren was associ-\nated with more positive well-being, fewer depressive\nsymptoms, and reduced cognitive impairment.\nAnother short-term benefit of grandparental investment\nis that grandchildren provide company. Individuals who\nlive in the company of more kin generally have improved\nhealth and a higher probability of surviving crisis situations\n(Sugiyama 2004). Consistent with such findings, in their\nstudy of 442 grandparents from the Longitudinal Study\nof Generations, Drew and Silverstein (2007) observed\nthat grandparents who lost contact with at least one of\ntheir grandchildren exhibited a steadily increasing inci-\ndence of depressive symptoms between 55 and 80 years\nof age. In contrast, in grandparents who experienced no\nloss of contact with their grandchildren, depressive symp-\ntomatology remained stable. This effect was robust to the\ninfluence of gender, education, marital status, number of\nchildren, and linear change in health.\nAlthough these studies observed ways in which grand-\nchildren can benefit grandparents, they did not condition\nthese effects on grandparents\u2019 past investment behavior.\nThe two studies of which we are aware that examine the\nfuture effects of grandparental good deeds are by Fujiwara\nand Lee (2008) and Hughes et al. (2007). Fujiwara and\nLee found that grandfathers and fathers (not grand-\nmothers and mothers) who provided moderate amounts\nof informal or financial support had a lower risk of devel-\noping major depression three years later. This association\nwas robust to the influence of additional factors associated\nwith the risk of major depression, including major\ndepression at baseline. Using data from the Health and\nRetirement Study, Hughes et al. found that grandmothers\nwho babysat for their grandchildren showed higher levels\nof self-rated health and were more likely to exercise two\nyears later compared with grandmothers who provided\nno care.\nTo conclude, the available evidence suggests that\naltruistic acts towards others (e.g., grandchildren) can\nhave beneficial consequences for the altruist\u2019s (e.g., grand-\nparent\u2019s) own physical and mental health (McClellan et al.\n1993), including a reduced risk of morbidity and mortality\n(Brown et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2003). However, as\nbefore, let us not lose sight of the boundary conditions\nof grandparental altruism. When the demands of helping\nbecome too much, the impact on health can be negative\n(Goh 2009; Lee et al. 2003; Post 2005). That is, just as\ngrandparents who lose contact with their grandchildren\nexperience deterioration in their physical and emotional\nhealth (Drew & Silverstein 2007; Drew & Smith 2002),\nso too do those who assume primary caregiver responsibil-\nities (Heywood 1999; Ross & Aday 2006).\nThese findings suggest that moderation, as with many\nthings in life, in the amount of care grandparents give is\nlikely to optimize grandparental well-being. Figure 1 stylizes\nthis hypothesized nonlinear relationship between grandchild\ncare and grandparental well-being. Myriad factors, such as\nthe availability of resources, gender, and life transitions\n(e.g., retirement), will affect the nonlinear relationship\ndepicted in Figure 1. Perhaps one of the most important\nmoderating factors is the degree to which grandparents are\noverstrained by the simultaneous demands of caring for\nboth their ailing parents and grandchildren (Cooney &\nAn 2006; Grundy & Henretta 2006). Interestingly, the\nsame nonlinear relationship may be true for the grandchild\u2019s\nwell-being: Very low and very high levels of grandparental\ninvolvement can have a negative impact on the development\nof grandchildren (Lavers & Sonuga-Barke 1997).\n8.3. Contemporary grandparental investments and\nfertility: How and why are they related?\nLet us return to one key evolutionary account of grandpar-\nental altruism. Could grandparents in industrialized\nsocieties boost their own fitness by investing resources in\ntheir children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s survival and repro-\nduction? We do not know of any study into this possibility,\nand this lack is not surprising given the demographic\nchanges in industrialized societies (sect. 5). There are,\nhowever, separate lines of research documenting fertility\ntrends and levels of grandparental childcare across\ncountries. Connecting these two lines reveals an interest-\ning picture for Europe. Using data from the 2004 Survey\nof Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE),\nHank and Buber (2009) have reported the percentage of\ngrandparents who provided any care (over the last 12\nmonths), and who provided regular care (i.e., almost\nweekly or more often over the last 12 months) across ten\nEuropean countries. The trends for both kinds of care\nare reversed. The prevalence of any care is highest\namong Danish, Dutch, French, and Swedish grandparents\nFigure 1. A schematic representation of the hypothesized\nnonlinear relationship between the care grandparents take of\ntheir grandchildren and the grandparents\u2019 well-being.\nNote. a Well-being encompasses various positive emotions such\nas satisfaction and contentment, and positive activities, such as\nspending time in company.\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 17\nand lowest among Italian and Spanish grandparents. In\nterms of regular care, however, Greek, Italian, and\nSpanish grandparents score highest, whereas Danish,\nFrench, and Swedish grandparents contribute least.\nWhen one correlates the likelihood of regular care with\ntotal fertility rates in the ten European countries studied\nby Hank and Buber, one finds a strongly negative corre-\nlation (Spearman rank correlation \u00bc \u2013.88, p \u00bc 0.008; we\ncalculated this correlation using estimated fertility rates\nfor 2009; Central Intelligence Agency 2009). That is, sur-\nprisingly, high levels of investment by grandparents are\nassociated with low fertility rates.\nWhy is that? Among the key variables contributing to this\nrelationship are likely to be women\u2019s participation rate in\nthe labor market and the availability of institutional care\n(Billari & Kohler 2004). In Europe, countries that value\ngender equality are likely to provide state-subsidized\nday care and other institutional support for working\nwomen, thereby reconciling the conflict between mother-\nhood and work. In contrast, countries such as Greece,\nItaly, and Spain have relatively little state-financed day\ncare, and women are more likely to stay at home after\nthey become mothers. Indeed, Italy and Spain have mark-\nedly lower labor force participation of women than, for\nexample, Denmark, France, and Sweden. Because of the\nlower female participation rate, there is, as Hank and\nBuber (2009) suggest, less demand for grandparents to\nhelp out in Italy and Spain, relative to, say, Denmark. If,\nhowever, aMediterraneanmother decides to have children\nand continue to work, she has to rely on grandparents\u2019\nsupport on a regular basis (for U.S. data, see Presser\n1989). Consequently, parents of a working mother might\nhave been key to their daughters\u2019 decision to have children.\nFor these grandparents, grandparental care and reproduc-\ntive successmight indeed be closely related.More generally,\nthis initial and speculative analysis illustrates that studying\nthe interplay of evolutionary (e.g., fertility), economic (e.g.,\nwomen\u2019s participation rate in the labor market), and insti-\ntutional variables (e.g., availability of institutional care)\npromises to yield new insights into the impact of grand-\nparental investment in industrialized societies.\n9. Grandparental investment: A research program\nfor the future\nFrom babysitting to support when the kids set fire to the\ncarpet, having grandparents around can be invaluable.\nThe extent to which grandparents\u2019 presence and support\nmatter and can be explained has piqued the interest of\nvarious disciplines. Approaches, however, have often\nremained within the boundaries of one discipline. In indus-\ntrialized societies, however, grandparental transfers cannot\nbe understood without analyzing how institutions (e.g.,\nsocial welfare regimes, inheritance laws) shape them. Ana-\nlyses of institutions, in turn, need also to consider how prox-\nimate mechanisms, such as values, norms, and the empathy\nmechanism, may protect grandparental care from being\ncrowded out. In addition, determinants derived from an\nevolutionary framework (Table 1), in combination with\ninterindividual differences in values, can be key in predict-\ning and explaining systematic variability among grandpar-\nents. Multiple disciplinary theories and hypotheses are in\nplace \u2013 one task for the future is to get serious about\nintegrating them into a larger framework. Based on this, a\nseries of old and new questions await answers. As revealed\nby our review, we know relatively little about the hypothesis\nwe have explored here, namely, that the beneficial effects of\ngrandparental investments in industrialized societies may\nreside in \u201csofter\u201d dimensions, such as the grandchildren\u2019s\ncognitive and verbal ability, mental health, and well-being.\nYet, there is suggestive evidence that the help of emotionally\nclose grandparents can be an important asset under circum-\nstances of duress. This potential, however, deserves to be\nstudied across the manifold circumstances of duress in\nwhich social support matters, some of which are listed\nhere. Moreover, to the extent that grandparents are tar-\ngeted as public health assets, we need to better understand\nthe boundary conditions of the beneficial impact and the\ncounterproductive effects, and examine the various costs\nand benefits that grandparents reap from their investment.\nWehope that our review is a first step toward amore encom-\npassing research program on grandparental investment.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nOur thanks go to James Chisholm, Edward Hagen, Sarah\nHrdy, Debra Judge, Barbara Marti, Kathy Sanders,\nRebecca Sear, Virgina Vitzthum, and five anonymous\nreferees for many constructive comments.

Fossil records suggest that the extended postreproductive\nlifespan in women and the long period of childhood development\nappeared at roughly the same time in human ancestry (Bogin 1997;\nBogin & Smith 1996). This is consistent with the proposition that\nboth of these unique features of the human life history \u2013 most\nlikely linked by a general increase in longevity \u2013 evolved together\nas a self-reinforcing unit (e.g., Carey & Judge 2001). Evidence\nbased on extinct hominid species suggests that the uniquely long\nhuman lifespan is not a recent development (possibly due to\nmodern medicine; Weiss 1981). Hammer and Foley (1996) calcu-\nlated estimates for hominid longevity using 13 anthropoid primate\nsubfamilies and five extant ape species. The longevity estimates for\nthe Australopithecines (2\u20134 million years ago) as a whole (45\u201353\nyears) overlap with those of modern chimpanzees (47\u201350 years).\nBy 2.4 to 1.6 million years ago, Homo habilis was estimated to\nhave a longevity of 52\u201356 years, which exceeds age at menopause\nin contemporary human populations. Longevity estimates\nincreased dramatically in Homo erectus (60\u201363 years), providing\nsome 15\u201318 years of postreproductive lifespan (Judge & Carey\n2000). The estimates continued to rise for Homo sapiens (66\u201372\nyears), and reached 78 years when estimates were based on the\nbrain sizes of anthropoid primates, which are compatible with\nextant hunter and gatherer populations (Blurton Jones et al.\n2002; Gurven & Kaplan 2007; see lower estimates by Caspari &\nLee 2004; McHenry 1994).\n2. We refer to both hypotheses to represent two lines of work\nthat attempt to understand the evolution of menopause and\nCoall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n18 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nlongevity in humans. Each of these perspectives, however, con-\nsists of several different hypotheses. For example, the good-\nmother hypothesis (Alexander 1974; Sherman 1998) has several\nsimilar variants including the stopping early hypothesis\n(Hawkes et al. 1998; Williams 1957), the prudent-mother hypoth-\nesis (Hrdy 1999), and the altricial lifespan hypothesis (Peccei\n1995; 2001b). The same may also be said of the grandmother\nhypothesis (see Peccei 2001a).\n3. The beneficial influence of mothers on the survival of their\nchildren is universal (Sear & Mace 2008) and may have been the\ninitial advantage for a post-reproductive lifespan in humans (e.g.,\nAlexander 1974; Fedigan & Pavelka 2001; Hrdy 1981; Lancaster\n& King 1985; Lancaster & Lancaster 1983; Madrigal & Melen-\ndez-Obando 2008; Packer et al. 1998; Pavard et al. 2007;\nPeccei 1995; 2001b; Penn & Smith 2007; Sherman 1998). In\naddition, there are also integrative hypotheses regarding the evol-\nution of menopause, but they have not been thoroughly tested yet\n(e.g., Cant & Johnstone 2008).\n4. This pattern of grandparental investment has been shown\nacross a wide range of grandparent\u2013grandchild relationship vari-\nables, including care during childhood, emotional closeness,\nrelationship closeness, financial support, and contact (see Bishop\net al. 2009; Bridges et al. 2007; Chrastil et al. 2006; Dubas 2001;\nEisenberg 1988; Euler & Weitzel 1996; Hoffman 1980; Kahana\n& Kahana 1970; Laham et al. 2005; Mills et al. 2001; Monserud\n2008; Pashos 2000; Pollet et al. 2009; Scholl Perry 1996; Smith\n1991; Steinbach & Henke 1998; Uhlenberg & Hammill 1998).\n5. The downward flow of resources from older to younger\nmembers of a society or family appears to be a consistent pattern\nfound in both contemporary traditional and Western societies\n(e.g., Attias-Donfut et al. 2005; Bengtson 2001; Caputo 1999;\nEssock-Vitale & McGuire 1985; Hogan et al. 1993; Kaplan 1994;\nKohli 1999; Kotlikoff & Summers 1981; Lee 1997; Schro\u00a8der-But-\nterfill 2004; Streib 1958; Szinovacz 1998a; Turke 1988).\n6.

Although many grandparents feel that it is their responsibil-\nity to help raise their grandchildren when their biological parents\nare not available, being a custodial grandparent impacts nega-\ntively on grandparents\u2019 physical and emotional health, their econ-\nomic hardship, and their own social networks (Burton 1992;\nEdwards 2006; Fuller-Thomson 2005; Fuller-Thomson &\nMinkler 2000; Hayslip & Kaminski 2005; Heywood 1999; Joslin\n& Harrison 2002; Lee et al. 2005; Oburu 2005; Oburu & Pal-\nmerus 2005; Ross & Aday 2006).\nOpen Peer Commentary\nGrandparental investment and the\nepiphenomenon of menopause in\nrecent human history\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991579\nDouglas C.

Although investment of relatives in kin produces\nobvious benefits for kin groups, selection for a postreproductive period\nin humans is not supported by evidence from chimpanzees. Instead,\ngrandparental investment is likely a recent phenomenon of longevity,\nrather than an evolved feature.\nGrandparenting has clear advantages in modern societies,\nproducing benefits that affect social outcomes. The effect is\nsuch that Coall & Hertwig (C&H) propose a host of potential\nbenefits, and some consequences, to be studied as a result of\nthe influence of grandparenting. However, despite the socio-\nlogical and economic effects of grandparenting studied today,\nthere is little information regarding the evolution of grandpar-\nenting. Williams\u2019 (1957) assertion that early termination of\nfertility would be adaptive when maternal care is important to\noffspring survival, proposes that reproductive senescence is\nadaptive by enhancing the inclusive fitness of grandparents.\nWhile this premise has been modified several times in the past\nfifty years, all of the current hypotheses surrounding the evol-\nution of grandparenting make the assumption that any feature,\nespecially that which brings benefit to the family group, must\nbe adaptive.\nIf it is adaptive, then menopause is a human autapomorphy.\nWhile it has been suggested that chimpanzees (Atsalis &\nVidean 2009; Jones et al. 2007) and gorillas (Atsalis & Margulis\n2008) go through menopause if they live long enough, other\nstudies (Cloutier et al. 2009; Emery Thompson et al. 2007)\nsuggest that menopause as it is applied to humans does not\nexist in chimpanzees. Chimpanzees fail to go through operational\nmenopause, the cessation of menstrual cycling, as humans do.\nIndeed, chimpanzees have been recorded to have offspring\nwell past the age of forty (Cloutier et al. 2009). Although chim-\npanzee females may not spend their lives in the same group as\noffspring, most certainly spend years as grandmothers before\ndaughters emigrate. However, there is no evidence that the\ngrandmother\u2019s fecundity is reduced by the presence of their\ndaughter\u2019s offspring. If one assumed that menopause should be\nadaptive and lead to the evolution of grandparenting, then it\nwould seem likely that the trait should have evolved in our\nclosest living relatives during their five million year history.\nHowever, this has not been the case, suggesting that menopause\nis a uniquely human character.\nAdaptation assumes that a feature enhances fitness, and has\nthe opportunity to be under selective pressure. While it has\nbeen argued that menopause is adaptive by protecting the indi-\nvidual from survival risks to herself or her potential offspring\n(Kuhle 2007; Peccei 2001a), all of the hypotheses overlook the\nfact that menopause and life expectancy into postreproductive\nyears are recent phenomena of human evolutionary history.\nPrior to 1900, there is little evidence to support menopause as\na universal phenomenon in humans due to low life expectancy\n(see Christensen et al. 2009). This suggests that prior to the\n20th century menopause was not under selective pressure, as\nthose individuals who lived into their post-menopausal years\nwere few. As a result, the effect of living beyond reproductive\nyears is a phenomenon that could have only recently come\nunder selective pressure. However, it is unlikely that characters\nexpressed in postreproductive years could be under selective\npressure.\nCurrent life expectancy projections for Europe and North\nAmerica (Christensen et al. 2009) suggests that humans can\nexpect that almost half of their lives will be spent in postrepro-\nductive years. This could suggest that any benefit produced\nthrough a grandmother effect would be erased by the demands\nof offspring to care for grandparents. If maximum life expectancy\nwere realized in humans, then the evolutionary costs could\nquickly outweigh the gains. However, in assuming that there is\nselective pressure on a postreproductive character, one has to\nassume that the character can be selected at all.\nIn the wild, few female chimpanzees survive past fifty (Hill\net al. 2001), yet many become grandparents during their life. It\nis suggested that a similar life history was the norm throughout\nhuman evolution until recently (Caspari & Lee 2004). Indeed,\nit is only recently that both humans and chimpanzees have\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 19\nbeen found to live into either their postreproductive years\n(humans) or their pseudo-postreproductive years (chimpanzees).\nIn the case of chimpanzees there is no current evidence of a ces-\nsation of menstrual cycling or a complete loss of fertility (Cloutier\net al. 2009; Emery Thompson et al. 2007), whereas in humans\nthere is clear evidence that humans cease cycling after approxi-\nmately fifty years of age. This disparity makes chimpanzees\npoor models for the evolutionary development of menopause.\nInstead, menopause must be viewed in light of human evol-\nutionary history alone. Although it can be argued that a postrepro-\nductive period enhances fitness by reducing the risks of\nreproduction on the mother and the offspring, it is unlikely that\nthe postreproductive period can be viewed as adaptive for the\nfunction of grandmothering. Ellison (2001) suggests that meno-\npause could be an exapted feature of the depletion of a female\u2019s\nsupply of oocytes. This implies, however, that oocyte depletion is\nadaptive. Although the quality of oocytes decreases in a female\u2019s\nlifetime, there is little to suggest that the feature should be\nselected. Again, there is little evidence suggesting a decline in\nthe quality of oocytes in chimpanzees with age. If chimpanzees\nevolved the ability to continue to produce viable offspring to the\nend of their lives, then it would stand to reason that the same\nfeature should be present in humans. That the feature is lacking\nin humans may not be a reflection of an adaptation to preserve\noocyte quality, but instead could suggests that humans possess\nthe feature as an epiphenomenon (Bogin & Smith 1996).\nIt is apparent that humans have benefited from relatives living\ninto their postreproductive years. However, these benefits should\nnot be viewed as adapted or selected, since their presence in\nhuman populations is recent. If menopause evolved to reduce\nthe risks to the mother and offspring, then it should have\nevolved to begin at age 35, an age when the likelihood of risks\nto mother and offspring dramatically increase (Morris & Alber-\nman 2009). In addition, there is little evidence to support the\nclaim that there can be selection for a postreproductive period\nthat would lead to grandparenting. More likely, grandparenting\nis a happy byproduct of other human characteristics, making it\nat best an epiphenomenon.\nIntegrating evolutionary and social science\napproaches to the family\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991580\nDonald Cox\nDepartment of Economics, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467.\ndonald.cox@bc.edu\nhttp:\/\/www2.bc.edu\/\u223ccoxdo\/\nAbstract: Recent work on the evolution of utility has brought the blunt\ninstrument of kin selection closer to the cluttered scalpel kit of social\nscience. The concept of diminishing marginal utility can help\nstreamline the latter. Reconciling ultimate causes with proximate\ninclinations, however, will be easier for the case of assistance from\ngrandparents than assistance to them.\nThe surest way to better understand grandparenting \u2013 or most\nanything else about families \u2013 is to heed Coall & Hertwig\u2019s\n(C&H\u2019s) call for interdisciplinary mutualism. They are exactly\nright: Pitting evolutionary and social science as contenders for\ncenter stage gets us nowhere. Progress will come from recogniz-\ning that the two approaches emanate from distinct corners of a\nsingle \u2013 and woefully incomplete \u2013 puzzle.\nAdvances will require continuing efforts to connect distant\ndots \u2013 ultimate and proximate forces \u2013 to plumb the interplay\nbetween, say, kin selection\u2019s primal tug and the exigencies of\nhedonics and budgets, played out in the context of real-world\nculture and institutions.\nFortunately,morework exists along these lines than the fewhar-\nbingers of hopeC&Hmention.What they aptly call a \u201cmotivational\nengine\u201d was added to evolutionarymodelsmore than a decade ago,\nwhen economists replaced the standardmaximand of reproductive\nsuccesswith something just as fundamental butmore immediate \u2013\nindividual well-being (i.e., \u201cutility\u201d), which includes feelings for\nother family members (e.g., Alger & Weibull, forthcoming; Berg-\nstrom 1997). This refinement retains the essence of kin selection\n(i.e., caring about one\u2019s genetic legacy), but fleshes out the\ndetails about how much help is provided and when. Help is\nsubject to diminishing marginal utility: the better off the recipient\nbecomes, the smaller the impact of additional help; the worse the\npredicament, the more help matters. Diminishing marginal utility\nis a simple but powerful idea.\nFor example, grandparents and would-be grandparents have\nbeen found to be most likely to assist their adult children with\nhousing down payments when the children: (a) wanted to have\na child of their own but (b) were concerned that their present\nliving quarters were too small to accommodate one (Cox &\nStark 2005). The first reason is arguably tied up with the ultimate\nmotive of fitness; the second, with the proximate motive of mar-\nginal utility: All else equal, the smaller the adult child\u2019s living\nspace, the more grandparental assistance matters.\nDiminishing marginal utility can explain C&H\u2019s finding that\ngrandparenting apparently confers less widespread or pro-\nnounced benefits for \u201clow risk\u201d families compared to their\n\u201chigh risk\u201d counterparts, where teenage pregnancy or maternal\ndepression occur. Large-scale help would be less consequential,\nand hence less prevalent, for grandchildren who are already well\noff. Evolution determines the capacity for altruism; but proxi-\nmate factors like diminishing marginal utility determine\nwhether and how this capacity is expressed.\nDiminishing marginal utility can also help reconcile seemingly\ndisparate motives for kin assistance. Consider altruism and\nexchange, which C&H \u2013 and just about every other researcher \u2013\ncast as competing motives. The logic of helping behavior can be\nsimplified and enriched by considering how the two might\ncoexist and when one or the other might dominate.\nFor instance, imagine that Aaron and Ben are colleagues in a\nfirm. At a company picnic by a lake, Aaron hears Ben\u2019s cries\nfor help, realizes he is drowning, and prepares to risk his life to\nsave him. Fast-forward to a time long after Ben\u2019s rescue. The\nurgency of altruistic transfers has fallen; Ben is no longer\nsomeone at death\u2019s door \u2013 he is now just someone who works\ndown the hall. Aaron might still help Ben, but only quid pro\nquo: the same people, but different circumstances and hence\ndifferent motives for helping.\nThis portmanteau approach has the counterintuitive impli-\ncation that the worse off recipients are, the more likely the intro-\nduction of public transfers will crowd out private giving. Return\nto our example and suppose a town lifeguard were to save Ben,\nthereby letting altruist Aaron off the hook. To cast things in\nmoney terms, imagine that social insurance aids impoverished\nBen, thereby supplanting Aaron\u2019s help. But if Ben were already\nwell off enough that the relevant motive were exchange, increases\nin Ben\u2019s income would only serve to strengthen his bargaining\nposition with Aaron, thereby generating \u201ccrowding in.\u201d\nThe contrasting income effects can explain why evidence for\ncrowding out is scarce for Europe and the United States but\nnot for developing countries, where private assistance matters\nmore for addressing basic needs (Cox & Fafchamps 2008).\nHow does a proximate motive like altruism mesh with the ulti-\nmate influence of kin selection? If Aaron were Ben\u2019s grandfather,\nit is easy to see how they would dovetail. And generational altru-\nism in the opposite direction \u2013 say, care that adult children\nprovide to their parents \u2013 could be reconciled by appealing to\nthe fitness benefits of grandparenting, as in \u201cThe sooner I can\nget Mom back on her feet, the more she can do for my kids.\u201d\nBut what about instances of elder care with no apparent fitness\nadvantage, such as an adult child who, amid demands of work and\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n20 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nchildrearing, makes time for her frail and indigent mother? Some\nupstream transfers appear to fit this description (e.g., Perozek\n1998; Sloan et al. 1997), yet they pose a difficulty for kin selection\nthat has attracted surprisingly little notice in the evolutionary lit-\nerature. A gene that impelled the provision of such care would\neventually be out-competed by fitness-enhancing ones. The\nsame goes for the evolution of cultural practices (remember\nthe Shakers?).\nWhat about empathy, a motive deeply ingrained yet focused on\ntoday\u2019s cues, rather than tomorrow\u2019s fitness? Surely the care\ndescribed above would qualify as such \u2013 the key question is\nhow it could prevail in an evolutionary environment. If, in the\nauthors\u2019 words, \u201cempathy-based acts are allocated in accordance\nwith kin and reciprocal altruism theory\u201d (target article, sect. 4.3,\npara. 5), they had better not be allocated too strictly or we are\nback to square one. One could speculate that unrequited elder\ncare is somehow tied up with the forces of group selection \u2013\ngroup-beneficial norms against preventable suffering, say \u2013 and\nprovided out of fear of altruistic punishment. Or, that it is a by-\nproduct of deep-rooted inclinations to reciprocate, or perhaps a\nsignal of willingness to cooperate with non-kin. Finding the evol-\nutionary basis for this expression of empathy appears to require\nconnecting dots that for the moment appear exceedingly\ndistant. But it is likely a feasible task, and certainly one that\nwould be worthwhile.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank Tracy Vietze and Ingela Alger for comments.

Euler\nInstitute of Psychology, Department of Economics, University of Kassel, 34127\nKassel, Germany.\neuler@uni-kassel.de\nhttp:\/\/www.psychologie.uni-kassel.de\/indexpers.htm\nAbstract: In order to evaluate the impact of contemporary\ngrandparenting, the view should not be restricted to developmental\nachievement effects in grandchildren. Both child happiness and\ngrandparent happiness are high-ranking goals with implications for\npublic policy. The beneficial impact of grandparenting for risk families\nappears unequivocal, and modern life still encounters all kinds of\nunpredictable risks. Contemporary grandparental care is no\nevolutionary mismatch.\nUp until a few decades ago, grandparenting was no salient topic\nin the sciences of human behavior. As Coall & Hertwig (C&H)\nhave shown, it has become a topic of study on which researchers\nhave weighed in from their respective disciplines. Grandparent-\ning is now studied by sociologists, biologists, anthropologists, and\nevolutionary psychologists. The academic disciples differ in their\ncontributions. Sociologists tend to interpret data a-theoretically.\nTheir resistance to biological accounts of human behavior,\nhowever, frequently prevents a cut of nature at its joints: the dis-\ntinctions between grandparent sexes, or lineage (parent sexes), or\nboth, are frequently omitted in social science research (e.g.,\nPatrick & Goedereis 2009). Both variables, however, are perva-\nsively important. Anthropologists, inspired by the Grandmother\nHypothesis, inspect hard reproductive data such as number of\noffspring or grandchild mortality. Psychologists usually present\nsoft data, such as rated emotional closeness or grandparental soli-\ncitude. C&H have done a commendable job in bringing the\nvarious approaches together and highlighting their respective\ncontributions fairly. Their review is, in my opinion, one of the\nvery best about grandparenting.\nI take the liberty to comment on the results from Tinsley and\nParke (1987). C&H interpret these results as suggestive of the\nbeneficial effects of grandparenting on the mental development\nof grandchildren. C&H prudently say that the data suggest an\nassociation which is not necessarily causal. A genetic confound\nmight be excluded by the observation that more significant\nassociations (namely, 7) between grandparent\u2013infant interaction\npatterns and infant development scores were found for grand-\nmother\u2013infant dyads than for grandfather\u2013infant dyads\n(namely, 2). But the study does not indicate the extent to\nwhich these associations are grandparent-driven, as C&H\nassume, or grandchild-driven.\nMore important, however, is a finding by Tinsley and Parke\n(1987) which I consider highly relevant for the question of\nwhether grandparenting does any good in modern Western\ncountries. Cui bono? Grandparental care might not only be\ngood for grandchildren (and parents, for that matter), but also\nfor the grandparents themselves, provided the required grand-\nparental involvement does not exceed the grandparental\nresources. C&H acknowledge the possible benefits of grandpar-\nenting for grandparents at the end of the target article, but they\nmight have overlooked a noteworthy finding by Tinsley and\nParke: namely, that contact with the infant was rated substantially\nand significantly more satisfactory by grandparents than by\nparents, this finding applying equally to both genders of grand-\nparent\/parent. From an evolutionary perspective, this point is\nto be underlined. Nepotistic effort is the salient life effort\nduring the sunset years (Alexander 1987), and it therefore\ncomes as no surprise that its practice is perceived as highly\nsatisfying.\nAn impression left by the studies reviewed by C&H is that the\neffects of grandparental care-giving count if they have an impact\non the achievement scores of grandchildren. The value of grand-\nparenting ought not to be so narrowly defined. In addition to\nachievement, there is also well-being, a feeling of connectedness,\nhappiness, and life quality, for both the grandchild and the\ngrandparent. Objective measures (e.g., survival rates, achieve-\nment scores) as well as subjective measures need to be con-\nsidered for grandparents, parents, and grandchildren.\nC&H clearly describe the consequences of the demographic\ntransition for grandparent\u2013grandchild relationships. The\nshared lifespan between grandparents and grandchildren is\nbound to become shorter; and increasingly there is only one\ngrandchild. We might ask whether deprivation of contact with\ngrandchildren might have adverse effects on the life quality of\nthe aged. I have had grandparents in my office weeping bitterly\nof their biggest misfortune: that they were denied contact with\ntheir only grandchild. Legislators have become sensitive\ntowards this problem. The recognition of grandparents\u2019 visitation\nand custody rights is a fairly recent trend.\nAlso rather recent is the increased consideration of grandpar-\nents in public child welfare (Herring 2008). Kin are increasingly\nused as foster parents. In the United States, the most common\nplacement for foster care is with grandparents, usually the\nmaternal grandmother (Scannapiego & Hegar 2002). Legislators\nand welfare agencies prefer to listen to the expert advice of social\nscientists rather than evolutionary biologists, but the blatant dis-\nregard for biological variables may come with costs. There are\nasymmetries between the sexes which do not disappear by\n\u201cdeconstruction\u201d or by benign neglect. If, for example, sociologi-\ncal studies investigate step-parent households \u2013 defined as those\nwith either a stepmother or a stepfather \u2013 an important distinc-\ntion is overlooked, namely, whether the biological parent with\nwhom the child co-resides is the mother or the father. Mother\nabsence is more disadvantageous to the child\u2019s development\nthan father absence, both with respect to the investments made\nin children and with respect to child outcomes (Case et al.\n2001), and parental investments are lower in stepmother families\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 21\nthan in birth mother families (Case & Paxson 2001). Most telling\nand directly relevant for grandparental care-giving are the find-\nings by Duflo (2003), who examined the flow of pensions given\nin South Africa to grandparents living with their grandchildren.\nDisturbingly, only the pensions to maternal grandmothers were\nchanneled on to grandchildren.\nThe review by C&H shows that grandparental investment\nprotects children from adverse effects in certain family situations\nwith high risks. Risky situations may, at first glance, appear to be a\nmatter of past epochs of famines, epidemics, and recurrent wars,\nor seem rare cases with little importance for normal modern\nfamilies. But the list of risks, which is not exhaustive, includes\nmaternal depression, teenage pregnancy, lone-parent, and step-\nparent families. These risks have such a high prevalence in\nmodern societies that there is, and always will be, a need for\nhelping grandparents whose assistance is good for the grandchil-\ndren \u2013 and also good for the grandparents, as long as they are not\nthe sole caretakers. Life has been risky in the past and will remain\nrisky in the future, even if the types of risks change with time.\nTherefore, contemporary grandparental care is not an evolution-\nary mismatch, an adaptation advantageous in ancestral environ-\nments but useless in modern times, like the hedgehog\u2019s instinct\nto roll itself inwards when a car approaches.\nGrandparental altruism: Expanding the sense\nof cause and effect\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991609\nEdmund Fantino and Stephanie Stolarz-Fantino\nDepartment of Psychology, University of California\u2013San Diego, La Jolla, CA\n92093-0109.\nefantino@ucsd.edu\nsfantino@psy.ucsd.edu\nAbstract: Grandparental altruism may be partially understood in the\nsame way as other instances of altruism. Acts of altruism often occur in\na context in which the actor has a broader sense of cause and effect\nthan is evident in more typical behavioral interactions where cause and\neffect appear relatively transparent. Many believe that good deeds will\nultimately produce good results.\nThe target article by Coall & Hertwig (C&H) makes a strong case\nfor the need to integrate different perspectives on grandparental\ninvestment, as well as for the difficulty of harboring all perspec-\ntives under a single convenient tent.\nAn additional argument against the sufficiency of theories that\nrely heavily on genetic relatedness comes from reports of inter-\nspecies adoptions. For example, Izar et al. (2006) reported on\nthe case of adoption of an infant marmoset by a group of wild\ncapuchin monkeys. Cross-species fostering is observed more\ncommonly in domestic animals; for example, Hersher et al.\n(1963) studied parameters that facilitated cross-species adoption\nbetween sheep and goats. Psychologists might point out that such\nbehavior represents generalization from behaviors appropriate\nfor the (adoptive) species toward conspecifics. Kuo (1930;\n1938) reported that when single kittens were raised with single\nrats, they appeared to be attached to one another; when groups\nof kittens and rats were raised together, the cats and rats\nappeared indifferent to each other. A further argument is an\nextension of C&H\u2019s point that the proximate cause for grandpar-\nental care of their children and grandchildren lies in the grand-\nparents\u2019 capacity for empathy, a point stressed by Hrdy (2009)\nand also by Fantino and Stolarz-Fantino (2002) in a Behavioral\nand Brain Sciences commentary on Rachlin\u2019s target article\n\u201cAltruism and Selfishness.\u201d In any event, the mechanism of\nempathy certainly need not be restricted to kin. In Fantino\nand Stolarz-Fantino (2002), we address the classic problem of a\nwoman rushing into a burning building to save an unknown\ncrying baby. We pointed out that negative reinforcement could\nprovide an account of altruism here: The altruist avoids the indel-\nible future memory of having done nothing to save the baby if she\ndoes not rush to help. In addition, we point out an array of\nreinforcement principles that can account for instances of altruis-\ntic behavior. Our experiences surely help to shape our propensity\nto be altruistic or not. For example, grandparents may well be\nexcellent at caring for their grandchildren, having learned how\nto do so when caring for their children (and having modeled\nsome of their own parenting behaviors upon those of their\nparents). Thus, a pattern of care-giving behavior has been\nacquired.\nOf course, not all grandparents behave caringly towards their\ngrandchildren, nor do humans and nonhumans regularly behave\naltruistically. In our laboratory, using one measure of altruism,\nthe Sharing Game (an economic activity related to the Dictator\nGame; Fantino & Kennelly 2009; Kennelly & Fantino 2007),\n20% of participants typically select altruistically, forsaking a\npayoff entirely in order to enrich an unknown other participant \u2013\nwhom they will never meet \u2013 when given a choice such as the\nfollowing:\nPlayer One receives $10 and Player Two receives $10\nOR\nPlayer One receives $0 and Player Two receives $100\nIn this choice, it was clear that real money was involved and\nthat the two players would never meet and would remain anon-\nymous. We have in fact now done an approximation to this\nstudy three times conducted by three different experimenters;\neach time approximately 20% of participants (college students)\nchose altruistically, being willing to distribute a substantial sum\nto the anonymous second participant while taking nothing for\nthemselves. Male participants were far more likely to select the\naltruistic option; this gender difference may reflect our published\nfinding that female participants prefer to make egalitarian selec-\ntions in the Sharing Game.\nNot all instances of altruistic behavior may be accounted for by\nobvious instances of reinforcement, nor with consideration of\ngenetics, relatedness, or individual experiences. A broader per-\nspective might involve an expanded view of the self, and even\nthe idea that individuals\u2019 behavior has important effects on\ntheir milieu, such that \u201cwhat goes around comes around.\u201d For\nexample, C&H discuss studies of altruistic punishment (e.g.,\nFehr & Gachter 2002; see also, Zizzo & Oswald 2001). A type\nof altruistic punishment ripped from the headlines involves\nthe punishment of those who talk loudly on their cell-phones\nin public places (as reported by Douglas Quenqua in an article\nin the New York Times; Quenqua 2009). The punisher may\ngain no benefit for himself but may improve the environment\nin which we all reside. The more the cell-phone abusers who\nare silenced, the quieter the environment for all of us. Also, it\nis widely believed that an environment filled with litter tends to\nattract more littering. Thus, if we punish littering, we may\nimprove the environment for us all. In both of these examples,\nhowever, the relationship between the altruistic act and the\nbenefits to the individual are extremely indirect and even\ntenuous. The problem is similar to one raised by C&H concerning\nhow we might \u201cbridge the gap between altruistic acts now and\nultimate reproductive success benefits in the future\u201d (sect. 4.3,\np. 6). In addition to an account in terms of empathy (with\nwhich we concur), the problem may be at least partially solved\nin two ways. First, it is not enough to think in terms of a \u201cself\u201d\nrestricted to the boundaries of the individual body. We live in\nan environment that has largely nurtured us (though for some\nfor whom this has not been the case, the propensity for altruism\nmay be low indeed). When we act in a way that benefits that phys-\nical and social environment, we can feel that we are benefiting\nourselves. The benefit need not be immediate. For most of us,\nstrict reciprocal altruism is not required. We have an expanded\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n22 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nview of cause and effect. Thus, most of us believe in what might be\nthought of as \u201cwhat goes around, comes around\u201d: Good that is\ndone ultimately comes back to us. To assess this, we asked\nmore than 300 undergraduates here at UCSD to what extent\nthey agreed with the statement, \u201cWhat goes around, comes\naround.\u201d Eighty-six percent of students were in agreement\n(only 8% disagreed; the others were neutral). Thus, the gap\nbetween altruism and its payoff may simply reside in the belief\nthat good deeds are ultimately rewarded. This type of belief\nmay help buttress the other causes that are so eloquently\nbrought to bear by C&H to account for grandparental investment\nand altruism.\nIntergenerational conflict over grandparental\ninvestment\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991610\nTim W.

Patterns of investment are subject to\nan intergenerational conflict over how resources should be distributed\nto maximize fitness. Grandparents may be selected to distribute\nresources unevenly, while their descendants will be selected to\nmanipulate investment in their own favor. Here we outline the\nevolutionary basis of this conflict.\nWe applaud Coall & Hertwig (C&H) for highlighting the central\nrole of evolutionary principles in understanding the important\nand understudied phenomenon of grandparental investment.\nBut we can take their approach further. A proper fitness-based\nanalysis of kin-directed behavior reveals considerable conflict\nand a richer, more complex picture of the selective forces\nshaping patterns of investment.\nAlthough equally related to all of their grandchildren, grand-\nparents are not necessarily selected to distribute their resources\nevenly. The optimal allocation pattern depends on the shape of\nthe curve describing fitness returns on their investment\n(Fig. 1). If fitness returns are linear (curve A), all distribution pat-\nterns yield the same total return; it does not matter whether they\nspread their investment evenly or favoritize particular grandchil-\ndren. If returns are decelerating (B), it always pays to invest in\nthe grandchild with fewest resources, which will tend to\npromote an even allocation pattern (though see below). If\nreturns are sigmoidal (C), intermediate levels of investment\nare favored; so grandparents with limited resources might be\nbetter off directing them all to one grandchild rather than\ntrying to spread them evenly. Other curves are possible and\nmay favor alternative patterns of investment.\nThis situation is complicated further by the fact that grandchil-\ndren may receive different levels of investment from their own\nparents (i.e., the grandparents\u2019 offspring and sons-\/daughters-\nin-law), putting them at different positions on the returns-on-\ninvestment curve. As an example, consider two grandchildren,\nx and y (shown in Figure 1), who are first cousins (they share\ngrandparents, but not parents). Prior to any grandparental\ninvestment, these individuals have received different amounts\nof investment from their own parents. Grandchild y is in a rela-\ntively privileged position, in that its parents have been able to\ninvest more resources in it than the parents of grandchild x.\nHow should the grandparents optimally invest in these grandchil-\ndren? The answer depends on the shape of the returns-on-invest-\nment curve. If returns are decelerating, grandparents should\ninvest preferentially in grandchild x; if returns are sigmoidal,\nthey should favor grandchild y; if returns are linear, it does not\nmatter which grandchild they invest in.\nWhatever pattern of investment is favored from the point of\nview of the grandparents, the beneficiaries are unlikely to agree\nwith this. The evolutionary basis for intergenerational conflict\nover parental investment is well established (Trivers 1974), and\nthe same principles will lead to a similar intergenerational conflict\nover grandparental investment. Put simply, grandchildren are\nmore related to themselves (coefficient of relatedness, r \u00bc 1)\nthan to their siblings (r \u00bc 0.5) and cousins (r \u00bc 0.125), and so\nwill seek a disproportionate share of grandparental resources.\nTheir parents will partly support this bias, since they are more\nrelated to their own children (r \u00bc 0.5) than to their nieces and\nnephews (r \u00bc 0.25). Thus, as recognized by C&H, grandparental\ninvestment is not a one-way street; but this is the case even when\nthe investment is not reciprocated. More directly, descendants\nmay be looking to exploit their grandparents\u2019 willingness to invest.\nHow will this conflict manifest itself? The relatedness asymme-\ntry will favor behaviors in the grandchildren and their parents\nthat increase the chances of resources being allocated disproportio-\nnately to their own direct line of inheritance. This may entail\novert manipulation \u2013 for example, direct requests for resources \u2013\nbut also more subtle tactics such as maintaining regular contact\nwith the grandparents. Thus, while grandparents could conceivably\ninvest resources in their grandchildren as a way of encouraging\nsupport from those grandchildren or their parents (Friedman\net al. 2008; Laferre`re & Wolff 2006), a contrasting view is that\ngrandchildren and their parents actively seek contact with the\ngrandparents and provide support as a means of encouraging\ngreater resource investment.\nFigure 1 (Fawcett et al). Three hypothetical relationships\nbetween the total amount of resources invested in a grandchild\nand the expected fitness (lifetime reproductive success) of that\ngrandchild. A (solid line): linear returns on investment; B\n(dashed line): decelerating returns on investment; C (dotted\nline): sigmoidal returns on investment. The points x and y refer\nto two different grandchildren who have previously received\ndifferent levels of investment from their parents (see text for\ndetails).\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 23\nOf course, grandparents are not passive partners in this\nprocess, and will be selected to resist any attempts to divert\nresources that conflict with their own fitness interests. Typically,\ngrandparents will favor a more equal allocation of resources than\ntheir grandchildren, but depending on the returns-on-invest-\nment curves and the amount of resources contributed by the\nparents (Fig. 1), this may not always be the case. Where it pays\ngrandparents to favoritize particular grandchildren, the conflict\nwith those grandchildren will be weaker, while that with the\nothers will be intensified.\nTrivers (1974) recognized that intergenerational conflict over\ncare might also impinge on mate choice, and our own work\n(Buunk et al. 2008; van den Berg et al. 2009) supports this. As\nexplained above, grandparental investment decisions should\nbe sensitive to inequality in the resources their grandchildren\nreceive from other sources. A major determinant of this resource\ndistribution is the care provided by the sons- and daughters-in-\nlaw of the grandparents, that is, the parents who marry into the\ndescendant line. If these in-laws differ markedly in their contri-\nbutions to parental care, grandparents may adjust their own\nlevels of investment accordingly. But they might also be able to\nmanipulate the resource distribution in their favor at an earlier\nstage, by actively influencing their offspring\u2019s choice of spouse\nin the first place. Arranged marriages and other forms of\ncontrol over offspring\u2019s mate choice are common across cultures\nand throughout history (Apostolou 2007) and reveal considerable\ndisagreement over the characteristics of a suitable partner\n(Buunk et al. 2008; in press). Our evolutionary analysis (van\nden Berg et al. 2009) confirms that such disagreement can\narise from the intergenerational conflict over grandparental\ninvestment outlined earlier. Typically, individuals will value\ncaring qualities more highly in their offspring\u2019s mates (i.e.,\ntheir sons-\/daughters-in-law) than in their own mate.\nIn a general sense, we fully support C&H\u2019s first steps towards a\ntheory of grandparental investment, in which evolutionary prin-\nciples play a prominent role. But for a deeper understanding of\ninvestment patterns, we should explicitly consider the details of\nthe selective forces involved. Grandparental investment is not\nsolely in the hands of the grandparents; it is subject to an inter-\ngenerational evolutionary conflict in which the fitness interests\nof three generations are at stake, with each party selected to\nmanipulate the pattern of investment for its own benefit.\nMotivating grandparental investment\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991622\nDebra Friedmana and Michael Hechterb\naCollege of Public Programs, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ 85004;\nbSchool of Politics and Global Studies, Arizona State University, Tempe,\nArizona 85287-5102.\nDebra.friedman@asu.edu\nMichael.hechter@asu.edu\nAbstract: What makes the question of grandparental investment so very\ninteresting is trying to tease out the underlying motivations.\nGrandparental investment is variable and grandparental altruism, if it\nexists at all, is also variable. Neither evolutionary theory nor rational\nchoice theory has an easy time explaining this variation, and insight is\nfurther impeded by the absence of any compelling empirical studies\ndesigned for the purpose of testing alternative explanations of\nvariations in grandparental investment.\nAt the end of their article, Coall & Hertwig (C&H) call for a com-\nprehensive theory that takes into account evolutionary, econ-\nomic, and sociological variables. Yet, even if there were such a\ntheory, we might be no closer to a deeper appreciation of grand-\nparents\u2019 behavior with respect to their children and grandchil-\ndren. Certainly, since the publication of our article (Friedman\net al. 2008), in which we also reviewed the available empirical evi-\ndence, there have been no theoretically motivated empirical\nstudies. To gather such data would be exceptionally demanding:\nA comparative test of the relative merits of evolutionary and\nrational choice (or exchange-theoretic) explanations would\ndemand the study of investment behavior across a number of\nwhole family sets wherein there were at least two children each\nof whom had at least one child. Furthermore, to be a proper\ntest, the study would have to follow these family sets over time.\nGiven the requirements for this research, we may be engaging\nin theoretical speculation for quite some time.\nC&H advance the theoretical debate by their generous mul-\ntidisciplinarity, but they muddy it by conflating dependent\nvariables. Differential investment of time, money, and other\nresources in vivo is distinct from decisions about bequests, and\nso too is it distinct from opportunity for investment, which is\nyet different from its potential impact. Implications of grandpar-\nental solicitude for the public good in the form of potential\npolicies are definitely premature. (If societies are planning to\nsubsidize grandparental investment, is the outcome better if\nparents are subsidized for the care of their children rather than\nsubsidizing grandparents for the care of their grandchildren?\nOr is it more efficient and effective to promote childcare as\npaid work?) There is a bit of a too-rosy picture of grandparents,\nas well: Grandparents get older, sick, die, exact an emotional\nprice for their investments, and so on, even if they begin their\nsolicitude pure in their motivations.\nAs we are collectively waiting for the researchers who will\nmake the investments necessary to gather the data required for\nrobust empirical tests of the major competing theories, there\nare some purely theoretical debates still to be had. For instance:\n(1) Suppose that the evolutionary model were, in fact, a faith-\nful representation of grandparental motivation to invest?\nAccording to the model, we can count on parents to maximize\nthe well-being of their children in order to ensure genetic\nfitness. Why, then, don\u2019t grandparents simply invest in their chil-\ndren and assume that their children will do the same, obviating\nthe need for them to invest in their grandchildren, at least\nunder low-risk conditions? Whereas evolutionary theorists may\ndefine parental investment as all the resources that parents\ninvest in children to maximize their chance of survival to sexual\nmaturity, it is well known that parents continue to invest mas-\nsively in post-pubertal children, at least in developed societies\n(such as paying for their university tuition).\n(2) A fair amount is attributed to paternal uncertainty in evol-\nutionary theory (contrary to our own predictions). If grandpar-\nents have the choice between investing in a son\u2019s children and\nin a daughter\u2019s children, what is the prediction? According to\nevolutionary theory, why would grandparents with a choice\ninvest in a son\u2019s children at all? C&H note that \u201cthe general\nfinding that maternal grandfathers provide more investment to\ngrandchildren than paternal grandmothers . . . only held when\nthe paternal grandmothers had other children in whom to\ninvest\u201d (section 3.6, para. 2). Indeed so: grandparental invest-\nment is variable across children.\n(3) How does empathy add to understanding of differential\ninvestment? If there is an inbred empathic capacity, how are\nwe to explain variations in investment? Ditto for altruism.\n(4) Finally, the target article\u2019s Table 2 can only be taken\nseriously as evidence of any kind of grandparental impact on\ngrandchildren if it is compared with the impact that any adult\ninvestment \u2013 related and unrelated adults \u2013 have on outcomes.\nIs a grandparent really better than a fabulous \u2013 and well-paid \u2013\nnanny? The assumption that genetic fitness trumps pecuniary\nincentives is just that \u2013 an assumption, and a highly questionable\none at that.\nRecalling that our theory predicts that grandparents will invest\nin grandchildren of the child most likely to provide care for the\ngrandparent toward the end of life, here are some hypotheses\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n24 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nthat we would want to add to our model, based on C&H\u2019s\ndiscussions:\na. Grandparental investment will be indifferent to the age of\nthe grandchild (see target article, sect. 3.4, para. 1).\nb. Grandparental investment is independent of grandparent-\ngrandchild exchange and sensitive to grandparent-child exchange\n(sect. 4.1).\nc. Bequests are motivated by a different calculus than in vivo\ninvestments. Grandparents have no motivation to diverge from\nthe equal division norm in death, based on our model.\nd. Grandparents who make a clear investment in one set of\ngrandchildren are likely to have fewer depressive symptoms\nand reduced cognitive impairment (sect. 8.2, paras. 1\u20133).\nAll told, this is a topic that is ripe for a productive assessment of\nthe relative merits of evolutionary and rational choice theories of\nindividual behavior. The same is true for the much better\nappreciated phenomenon of declining fertility in developed\nsocieties. C&H advert to the demographic transition in their\nessay, but fail to point out that there is no satisfactory evolution-\nary explanation of it. Rational choice theory fares better in this\nrespect (Friedman et al. 1994).\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors are grateful for the comments of Satoshi Kanazawa.\nAn evolutionary perspective can help unify\ndisparate accounts of grandparental\ninvestment\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991634\nMichael Gurven and Eric Schniter\nIntegrative Anthropological Sciences Program, Department of Anthropology,\nUniversity of California\u2013Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3210.\ngurven@anth.ucsb.edu\neschniter@gmail.com\nhttp:\/\/www.anth.ucsb.edu\/faculty\/gurven\/\nhttp:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/ericschniter\/\nAbstract: Coall & Hertwig (C&H) bring attention to alternative accounts\nof grandparental investment from economics, evolutionary anthropology,\npsychology, and sociology, which have yet to be reconciled. We attempt to\nhelp integrate some of the disparate perspectives by expanding the scope\nof the evolutionary perspective, highlighting some gaps, and discussing\nproblems with the authors\u2019 treatment of grandparents in traditional\nsocieties.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) offer a comprehensive survey of litera-\nture pertaining to grandparental \u201caltruism\u201d and call for an\nintegration of disparate perspectives. Although the scope and\ncoherence of a unified theoretical approach are not clearly\ndefined, the authors are to be commended for raising important\nissues. We argue that evolutionary and rational actor perspectives\ncould be expanded to provide a framework that encompasses\nboth ultimate and proximate-level explanations.\nHighly encephalized brains, slow growth, and long lives are\nderived features of human life history, with juvenile dependency,\ncomplex skill development, and grandparenting as key com-\nponents. If the function of post-reproductive lifespan is to\nimprove fitness of descendant kin, a wide range of cognitive\nand behavioral traits that focus attention on perceiving and\nresponding to needs of particular kin is expected. Emotions,\nlike motivations, could further modulate behaviors that either\nbenefit or burden particular kin. Psychological studies of\nwisdom among older adults in modern societies (Baltes et al.\n1992) and of kin-favoring dispositions despite age-related phys-\nical decline (Carstensen & Lockenhoff 2003) are consistent\nwith an evolutionary perspective. Norms and institutions might\nhelp facilitate delivery of benefits, even when co-residence is\nunlikely, as codified in inheritance rules. Norms and institutions\nare considered features of the sociological domain and emotions\nas part of psychology, yet evolutionary theory and economics are\nrequired to make sense of why norms, institutions, and emotions\noccur in particular forms and expressions. The evolutionary study\nof emotions and norms is a rich industry.\nEvolution has led to a long human lifespan with a substantial\npost-reproductive phase, yet, despite the adaptive value that\ngrandparenthood must have provided our ancestors, the\nauthors point out a conundrum: Grandparents in the past over-\nlapped with grandchildren for a brief period but with large\nfitness impact, whereas longer-living grandparents today have\nmore overlap and thereby greater potential to help, but few\ngrandchildren. As a consequence, grandparents in the past\nincreased fitness by reducing infant mortality, but today mostly\nhave only \u201csoft\u201d impacts on well-being and cognition. We feel\nthat (1) the contrast made between past and present opportunity\nis overstated, and (2) differences in investment patterns depend\non marginal benefits of grandparental help, which varies among\nsocieties based on differences in fertility, production patterns,\nco-residence, and inheritance.\nContrary to the statement that grandparental opportunity is\nstrongest today, evidence suggests that the opportunity to help\ngrandchildren was higher among our hunter-gatherer ancestors.\nFirst, while mortality and fertility are lower today, age at first\nmarriage is also much later, and soWesterners become grandpar-\nents about 12 years later on average than do hunter-gatherers.\nThus, the average number of years lived as a grandparent may\nnot be very different between groups (Table 1). Second,\nhunter-gatherers are more likely to be co-resident with grand-\nchildren and the total number of grandchildren to potentially\nimpact is higher (fertility of hunter-gatherers is 4\u20138 births).\nThird, support for the idea that grandparents in traditional\nsocieties increase fitness has relied on historical demographic\ndatasets to measure the impact of their presence on early life\nmortality. Anthropological studies of grandparental contributions\nfocus primarily on food production of older adults. To our knowl-\nedge, caloric production (or any other grandparental behavior)\nhas yet to be causally linked to child welfare in any of these\nstudies. Despite the popularity and importance of the Grand-\nmother Hypothesis and alternate explanations of post-menopau-\nsal lifespan, all studies of grandparental impacts on kin fitness are\nindirect, based on whether a grandparent was alive or dead, or in\nrare cases, co-resident, in a given year. To what extent is the early\nweaning of infants, higher infant and child survivorship, and\nearlier reproduction, influenced by grandparents? Until these\npathways are studied, phenotypic correlations may confound\nany observed positive relationship between living grandparents\nand kin survivorship or fertility. Without an understanding of\nthe proximate mechanisms by which grandparents likely\nimproved kin welfare, detailed predictions about what grandpar-\nents should be doing today (and whether their behavior is mala-\ndaptive) are difficult to make.\nFitness is impacted by accumulating and transferring material,\nembodied, and relational wealth, and societies vary in the extent\nto which each of these is inherited and needed for cultural and\nbiological \u201csuccess\u201d (Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009). Grandpar-\nents should facultatively adjust their aid behavior where they\ncan have the highest marginal benefit at lowest personal cost.\nWhether in small-scale societies or modern post-industrial\nones, we suspect that the greatest impact of grandparents may\nbe realized during rare, but fitness-relevant, periods. The\nauthors describe postpartum depression and teenage pregnancy\nin modern societies as examples. We mention a few others here\nbased on ten years of fieldwork among Tsimane forager-horticul-\nturalists of Bolivia. Tsimane grandparents are often primary care-\ntakers when parents die: 17% of adult Tsimane interviewees had\na parent die before age 18, and 19% of these went to live with a\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 25\ngrandparent (9.8% with maternal, 9.0% with paternal). Even\nwhen not holding leadership positions, older adults mediate con-\nflicts between different kin factions, which helps to promote\ncoordination in activities so as to more efficiently reap gains\nfrom divisions of labor and economies of scale. While the \u201csoft\u201d\nimpact of grandparents in traditional societies has not been\ndescribed, we suspect that further inquiry may reveal that the\nmarginal impact of grandparents is not primarily in the form of\ncalories. Grandparents are named as important transmitters of\nTsimane skills and knowledge (Gurven & Kaplan 2008; Schniter\n2009); they account for 8% of identified contributors to early-life\nskill acquisition. They are twice as likely to be named for rare but\nimportant skills, such as making pottery, punishing bad behavior,\nsinging traditional songs, and telling old stories and myths.\nFinally, an evolutionary perspective emphasizes not only\ngrandparents\u2019 cumulative fitness impacts, but also the increasing\ncosts on descendants with age. Few hunter-gatherers and horti-\nculturalists live beyond the seventh decade of life. Among\nTsimane, we observed that grandparents in their 70\u2019s no longer\nmake net-transfers of food to grandchildren. Whether the comp-\nlementary contributions listed above are sufficient to slow the\ndecline in utility is an open question, but we suspect that net\nutility is negative by the late 70\u2019s. In pre-industrial societies\nwhere production is costly and resource competition is high, ger-\nonticide and neglect are commonly practiced (Maxwell et al.\n1984). Elderly populations today, whose knowledge and tra-\nditions may be devalued, given rapid cultural change, show\nincreasing evidence of neglect and abuse (Lachs & Pillemer\n2004). Intervention programs that focus on the marginal benefits\ngrandparents can offer may be helpful for strengthening familial\ncare networks and building communities (Denham & Smith\n1989). The total value of grandparents as fallback caretakers,\neducators, mediators, storytellers, and as sources of wisdom is\ntoo important as social insurance to risk losing, even in modern\nsocieties.\nGrandparental transfers and kin selection\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991646\nRaymond Hames\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68588.\nrhames@unl.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.unl.edu\/rhames\nAbstract: In the analysis of intergenerational transfer, several\nimprovements can be made. First, following kin selection theory,\ngrandparents have kin other than grandchildren in which to invest\nand therefore any investigation into grandparents should take this\nperspective. Secondly, how transfers actually enhance the survivorship\nof younger relatives such as grandchildren must be better measured,\nespecially in the ethnographic literature. Finally, the problem of\nindirect investments or targeting must be considered.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) present a wonderfully comprehensive\nand admirable review on the investing roles that grandparents\nplay in traditional and modern societies. I would direct any of\nmy students to this article if they were beginning research on\nthe topic. Given that the article is so comprehensive, I restrict\nmy comments to the history of this research in anthropology,\nespecially as it relates to kin selection theory and some measure-\nment issues that would better assess the ways in which grandpar-\nents matter.\nThere are several strands of research in evolutionary anthro-\npology that deal with the role that grandmothers may play in\nenhancing the fertility of their children and survival of their\ngrandchildren, beginning with the work of Turke (1989) and\nKaplan (1994) on intergenerational resource transfers, the litera-\nture on \u201chelpers at the nest\u201d (for a review, see Hames & Draper\n2004), as well as reviews of the grandmother literature (Sear &\nMace 2008). To a limited extent, the theme of extended family\nintergenerational transfers is picked up by the authors in\nsection 8.2 (under the heading of the \u201cone-way street?\u201d) and else-\nwhere. Turke and Kaplan criticized the work of the influential\ndevelopment demographer Caldwell (1976), who argued that\nhigh fertility in the developing world is a kind of social security\nmechanism whereby the elderly through high fertility produce\nchildren and eventually grandchildren who will support them\nin their old age. This strategy functions as insurance in social\nsystems that lack effective social security. Turke and Kaplan\nnote that Caldwell\u2019s model is a challenge to evolutionary demo-\ngraphy and kin selection theory because the fitness concerns of\nfamily members, especially grandparents, should lead to a flow\nof wealth and resources from those who have low reproductive\nvalue to those who have greater reproductive value, adjusted\nby the coefficient of relatedness. If the flow were opposite,\nfrom younger to older, the fitness of the younger would be\nreduced, as well as the inclusive fitness of the older generation.\nThe literature C&H review tends to support Turke and\nKaplan\u2019s view in the modern context, but we need more research\nin the developing world, as exemplified by the research reviewed\nby Sear and Mace (2008).\nThe next research thread moved the focus from the extended\nfamily to a close examination of the impact of grandparents and\nwas initiated by Hawkes and colleagues, beginning with their\nwork on Hadza grandmothers (Hawkes et al. 1989). These\nresearchers argued that menopause was designed by natural\nselection to channel resources to grandoffspring. This insight\ngenerated a large amount of high quality research on grand-\nmother effects on the survivorship of grandoffspring and the fer-\ntility of their children. C&H point out that much of this research\nis summarized in Hrdy\u2019s conceptualization of communal breed-\ning (Hrdy 2005a) and in the general literature on helpers at\nthe nest.\nTable 1 (Gurven & Schniter).

It seems that research\nmight be more profitably centered on how grandparents allocate\ntheir resources to all kin, including grandchildren, instead of\nfocusing on how much grandchildren have received from grand-\nparents. The grandparent to grandchild focus may hide transfers\nthat grandparents may make to other kin. Although grandchil-\ndren are related by one-quarter to grandparents, the latter are\nrelated to their nephews and nieces to the same degree, even\nthough the reproductive value of grandchildren is likely to be\nhigher. Secondly, another problem that needs to be methodolo-\ngically addressed is what can be called indirect transfers or the\nproblem of targeting (Hames 1987). Parents may be motivated\nto invest in their children because they know that such invest-\nments will be passed on to their grandchildren. For example, a\nmonetary transfer to a child with a new-born grandchild may\nbe motivated by a desire to invest in the grandchild by allowing\nits parents to make purchases that ultimately enhance the well-\nbeing of the grandchild. I would also add that the character of\ntransfers should be sensitive to the age of the grandchild, such\nthat initial investments may be in the form of direct grandparen-\ntal care such as babysitting, to monetary transfers later in life for\nassistance in higher education.\nMost of the studies in anthropology are demographic, in that\nthey show correlations between grandmother presence and\neither enhanced survivorship of grandchildren or greater fertility\nof mothers. It is clear that we need more observational or more\ndetailed survey research to learn exactly what grandparents do\nto cause these effects. This is particularly true of much of the eth-\nnographic research in traditional societies, but much less true in\nwealthy countries, as C&H show. In ethnographic research, how\ngrandchild survivorship and offspring fertility is achieved by the\npresence of grandparents is largely speculative, and C&H rightly\nnote that such research only \u201chighlight[s] potential behaviors\nthat promote these beneficial effects\u201d (sect. 2.5). Are mothers,\nfor example, spared child-care activities to enhance their pro-\nductivity, or do Hawkes et al.\u2019s \u201chardworking Hadza grand-\nmothers\u201d (Hawkes et al. 1989) produce food that is transferred\nto their daughters\u2019 households to enhance grandchild growth\nand development? These crucial sorts of investment could be\nmeasured in a variety of ways, such as carefully tracking data\non actual transfers or through time allocation data (time diaries\nor direct observation). These measures are particularly important\nbecause they more accurately gauge the exact kinds of benefits\nfrom grandparents to offspring and their likely effects.\nGrandparental investment facilitates\nharmonization of work and family in employed\nparents: A lifespan psychological perspective\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991658\nChristiane A.

We extend this approach by\naddressing the changing demands of balancing work and family in low-\nrisk families. Taking a lifespan psychological perspective, we identify\nadditional motivators and potential benefits of grandparental\ninvestment for grandparents themselves and for subsequent generations.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) discuss the changing role of grandpar-\nents in industrialized societies and the scarcity of research on\ngrandparental investment in low-risk families. They develop a\ncomprehensive model that generates novel hypotheses regarding\nthe psychological mechanisms underlying grandparental invest-\nments. Particularly, they emphasize the benefits of moving\nbeyond classic fitness indices and including psychological out-\ncomes. Taking a lifespan developmental perspective, we offer\nadditional reasons for focusing on grandparental investment as\na key resource that may promote the harmonization of work\nand family responsibilities in low-risk families, thereby enhancing\nthe developmental outcomes of children and grandchildren.\nPast research shows beneficial effects of grandparents on the\nhealth and survival of grandchildren in historical or contempor-\nary agricultural societies. It is an open question whether and\nhow these benefits extend to today\u2019s industrialized societies. Evi-\ndence from high-risk families suggests that grandparents consti-\ntute a protective resource for their grandchildren. Little is\nknown, however, about low-risk families. This research gap\nneeds to be filled for at least two reasons. First, many low-risk\nfamilies struggle to meet increasing demands at work and at\nhome. For instance, employers expect increasing flexibility and\nmobility of employees (Klumb & Gemmiti, in press), while insti-\ntutional childcare is rigid and not always available. The demands\nof juggling work and family life can negatively impact the health\nand well-being of parents and children alike (Strazdins et al.\n2006). Research on low-risk families will thus enable us to ident-\nify factors that enhance health and well-being in large segments\nof the population. Secondly, in some European countries, the\nincreased demands of juggling work and family life have\ncoincided with dramatic decreases in fertility. In Germany, for\nexample, childlessness increases with education and is highest\namong university graduates (Duschek & Wirth 2005). In other\ncountries, too, women\u2019s careers come at a cost to their private\nlives (Galinsky et al. 2003). Reversing such demographic trends\nis difficult, but seems possible (Myrskyla\u00a8 et al. 2009). Grand-\nparental support may be one important piece in this picture. By\nsupporting working parents, grandparents can serve as buffers\nagainst the negative consequences of parental stress on children,\nand, in regions with scarce childcare facilities, they may be an\nimportant factor in women\u2019s decisions to have children (Hank\n& Kreyenfeld 2003). Hence, there may be an important indirect\npathway through which grandparental investment benefits grand-\nchildren, namely, by alleviating stress in the middle generation.\nFurther investigation of this pathway seems promising, because,\nas C&H point out, the overlap between the lives of grandparents\nand grandchildren is currently at its peak.\nC&H develop intriguing hypotheses regarding the role of\npsychological mechanisms (e.g., empathy) in motivating grand-\nparental investments. We would like to offer an additional per-\nspective on the antecedents and consequences of grandparental\ninvestments by introducing the concept of developmental tasks\nto the discussion (Erikson 1966). The concept of developmental\ntasks represents a system of age-related, socially valued themes\n(Havighurst 1953). Generativity is a key task in the second half\nof the adult lifespan and is characterized by a sense of responsi-\nbility for subsequent generations, in particular a concern to guide\nthe next generation (Erikson 1966). Generativity is strongest with\nrespect to one\u2019s own offspring and may thus be an important\nmotivator for grandparental investments. For example, by parti-\ncipating in the care of grandchildren, grandparents may be able\nto help their adult children to reconcile their work and family\nresponsibilities while contributing to the raising and guiding of\ntheir grandchildren. The literature also proposes that the realiz-\nation of developmental tasks fosters personal growth and well-\nbeing. This suggestion is supported by observations that adult\nchildren\u2019s attainments and achievements are central for the\nwell-being of older parents (Ryff et al. 1994). Hence, generativity\nmay serve not only as an important motivator of grandparental\ninvestment benefiting younger generations, but also as a source\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 27\nof well-being for grandparents themselves. We would like to illus-\ntrate possible mechanisms by drawing on data from a recent study\non the pursuit of work and family goals in employed parents with\npreschool children (Hoppmann & Klumb 2004; 2006). The study\nasked 84 highly educated employed parents in Berlin to report\ntheir work and family goals, rate time- and strategy-based conflicts\nbetween their goals, and indicate access to grandparental child-\ncare. In addition, we recruited 31 of the grandparents who\nprovided childcare and asked them to complete the Loyola\nGenerativity Scale and to report their own goals, their respect\nfor their adult children\u2019s goals, and affect quality. As the Berlin\nmetropolitan area has a good childcare infrastructure, none of\nthe grandparents were daily caregivers. Findings indicate that\ngrandparental generativity, goals related to wanting to leave an\nimprint on others\u2019 lives and wanting to feel needed, and respect\nfor adult children\u2019s goals were positively associatedwith grandpar-\nents\u2019 desire to provide childcare. These associations held when we\ncontrolled for living distance, grandparental employment status,\nhealth, and age. Hence, generativity seems to be an important\nmotivator of grandparental investments. In addition, we found\nthat grandparental childcare provision and adult children\u2019s\npursuit of work and family goals were positively related to grand-\nparental positive affect. Hence, grandparental investments and\nadult children\u2019s achievements seemed to be important sources\nof well-being in this sample. Finally, we examined the impact of\ngrandparental childcare on their adult children. We found that\ngrandparental childcare buffered the negative effects of adult chil-\ndren\u2019s goal conflicts upon their pursuit of work and family goals.\nThis finding suggests that grandparental investments may\nindeed be a key resource facilitating the harmonization of work\nand family lives in adult children.\nFuture research on the buffering effects of grandparental\ninvestments should differentiate the needs created by different\ntypes of stressors. Grandparental support may be most effective\nwhen it matches those needs (Cohen & Wills 1985). For\nexample, grandparental childcare may help employed parents\nstruggling against time scarcity, but it may not work as well if\nemployed parents are emotionally challenged (Frone 2000). Fur-\nthermore, there may be circumstances in which grandparental\nsupport is a mixed blessing. Although grandparents may be a\npowerful resource capable of offsetting stress in younger gener-\nations, lifespan research shows that unasked-for support can be\nperceived as a suggestion of incompetence and thus a threat to\nthe self (Smith & Goodnow 1999). Hence, grandparental\nsupport may convey mixed messages that can strain relationships\nwith children. We would therefore like to emphasize the impor-\ntance of determining the specific conditions under which grand-\nparental investments are beneficial for all concerned.\nContinuity between pre- and post-\ndemographic transition populations with\nrespect to grandparental investment\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X0999166X\nBrad R. Huber\nDepartment of Sociology and Anthropology, College of Charleston, Charleston,\nSC 29424.\nHuberB@cofc.edu\nhttp:\/\/huberb.people.cofc.edu\/\nAbstract: This commentary suggests that there is more continuity in\npre- and post-demographic transition populations with respect to\ngrandparental investments than is assumed by Coall & Hertwig (C&H).\nRecent research employing high-quality data supports the claim that\nsex-biased grandparental investments are likely to exist in industrialized\nsocieties, and that the economic status of grandparents is related to\ntheir long-term fitness.\nI congratulate Coall & Hertwig (C&H) for their thorough and\nrigorous analysis of grandparental investment. I agree there is a\nneed for a more comprehensive theoretical framework of grand-\nparental investment, one that explains the proximate and\nultimate causes of investments, and that takes into account insti-\ntutional arrangements, such as the presence of a state-financed\nwelfare system. My comments focus on three claims the\nauthors make.\nThe authors claim that the impact of grandparental invest-\nments in contemporary industrialized societies is relatively\nsmall when measured by classic indicators of fitness, such as\nnumber of grandchildren and grandchild mortality. This point\nneeds some qualification. In post-demographic transition\npopulations where people are living under low-risk conditions,\ndirect grandparental investments will always have relatively\nlittle impact on the number and mortality of grandchildren\nwhen compared to the impact of direct grandparental invest-\nments in societies with high fertility and mortality rates. This is\nbecause the probability of grandchildren being born or dying is\nso much lower in post-demographic transition populations than\nit is in pre-demographic transition populations. Even if grandpar-\nents made very large direct investments in their grandchildren,\nthis will have relatively little impact on the number and mortality\nof grandchildren in industrial societies.\nHowever, the indirect investments grandparents make in\nindustrialized societies do make a tremendous difference in the\nlikelihood of their children and grandchildren surviving and\nreproducing. Here, I am referring primarily to the institutions\nthat grandparents, and other taxpayers, support (e.g., Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services) that create and maintain\nthe relatively low fertility, low mortality conditions under which\ntheir children and grandchildren live. Although it is difficult to\nmeasure the impact indirect grandparental investments have\non classic measures of fitness in contemporary industrialized\nsocieties, I would argue that their impact is very substantial.\nC&H\u2019s position regarding the application of the Trivers\u2013\nWillard hypothesis to parental and grandparental investments\nin industrialized societies also merits comment. I agree with\nthem that the evidence of differential resource allocation to\nsons and daughters by parents in industrialized countries is con-\nflicting, and that there is currently no convincing evidence of sex-\nbiased grandparental investment in humans. However, research-\ners may have been looking for evidence in the wrong places. In\nthe case of parental investment, Rosemary Hopcroft (2005,\np. 1116) notes that researchers generally focus on infants and\nrelatively young children. In her opinion, parental biases in\ninvestments for this age group are unlikely in a relatively\nwealthy society such as the United States.\nThat is, there are abundant resources available for parents to be able to\nmake these early investments in all children regardless of sex. Evol-\nutionary theory suggests that in such a situation of unusual abundance\nall children, irrespective of sex, will be highly valued and invested in by\ntheir parents. . . [Status] attainment in American society requires much\nmore than just investments in children as babies and adolescents; it\nrequires ongoing investments in very lengthy periods of education\nand occupational training. . . It is provision of support over such long\nperiods of time that is the scarce resource in American society. . . I\nsuggest, therefore, that the focus of studies testing the resource allo-\ncation version of Trivers\u2013Willard should be sex differences in parental\nprovision of access to extensive training and education and encourage-\nment of this process. (Hopcroft 2005, p. 1116)\nUsing years of education as an indirect measure of parental\ninvestment, and cumulative U.S. General Social Survey data,\nHopcroft found support for the Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis in\nthe United States. Sons of high-status fathers attain more edu-\ncation than daughters do, daughters of low-status fathers attain\nmore education than sons, and high-status men have more sons\namong their biological offspring than do lower-status individuals.\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n28 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nIn light of this finding, I am optimistic that researchers will\neventually find evidence for sex-biased grandparental invest-\nments in industrialized societies. Promising avenues of research\nmay include the financial and social investments made by grand-\nparents in their grandchild\u2019s education, occupational training,\nbusiness endeavors, and so forth.\nMy final comment concerns C&H\u2019s view that the poor now\nout-reproduce the wealthy in post-demographic transition\nsocieties. Has the availability of effective contraception really\nsevered the link between status and reproduction in modern\nhuman societies? One of the challenges of evaluating this ques-\ntion is having the right kind of data. I again look at Hopcroft\u2019s\nwork on reproductive success in the contemporary United\nStates (Hopcroft 2006, p. 107) to illustrate my point. She used\na representative sample containing data that made a distinction\namong an individual\u2019s biological, step, and adopted children. Pre-\nvious research on reproductive success in the United States. did\nnot make these distinctions and tended to rely on data that only\nreport female fertility or the number of children in a household.\nWith data that likely includes all, and only, the living biological\nchildren of men and women, Hopcroft (2006) found that high-\nincome men have more biological children than do low-income\nmen and high-income women.\nThere is also reason to believe that the economic status of\ngrandparents in at least one industrialized society is positively\ncorrelated with their long-term fitness, as measured by number\nof grandchildren. Recently, Anna Goodman and Ilona Koupil\n(2009) reported their research findings on the social and biologi-\ncal determinants of reproductive success in Sweden during the\n20th century. They used high quality, multi-generational data\non a cohort born from 1915 to 1929, a time when the Swedish\ndemographic transition was largely concluded. Goodman and\nKoupil had many interesting findings. The main one regarding\ngrandparental socioeconomic status and reproduction follows:\nThe effect of SEP [family socioeconomic position] is interesting in\nhighlighting the potential. . .continuity [between pre- and post-demo-\ngraphic transition populations with respect to]. . . the determinants of\nreproductive success. The continuity is illustrated by the positive cor-\nrelation in both sexes [of grandparents] between higher SEP and a\ngreater number of descendents. This is consistently observed in tra-\nditional populations (Hill & Kaplan 1999; Low 2000) and, although\nevidence in modern populations is more variable (Clarke & Low\n2001), our study adds to the evidence that the demographic transition\ndoes not necessarily erase the relationship between access to resources\nand reproductive advantage. (Goodman & Koupil 2009, p. 339)\nFitness effects of grandparental investments\nin contemporary low-risk societies\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991671\nRalf Kaptijn and Fleur Thomese\nFaculty of Social Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands.\nrwj.kaptijn@fsw.vu.nl\ngcf.thomese@fsw.vu.nl\nAbstract: Coall & Hertwig (C&H) suggest that, because grandparental\ninvestments do not impact on child mortality in low-risk societies,\nfitness effects are not plausible any more. We found that grandparental\ninvestments could very well alleviate contemporary constraints on\nfertility. Cultural factors may influence both the occurrence and impact\nof grandparental investments.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) argue that in contemporary affluent\nsocieties grandparental investments are no longer likely to have\na substantial positive effect on classical fitness indicators like\nchild mortality. However, child mortality is only one component\nof fitness. Other components such as fertility and age at first\nreproduction have gained more importance in modern societies.\nIn these societies, grandparental investments may relieve some of\nthe important impediments on women\u2019s reproduction and in this\nway have a positive influence on fertility. Recent, yet unpub-\nlished, research supports this hypothesis.\nEven though under modern conditions almost all children stay\nalive after birth, there are considerable impediments to women\u2019s\nreproduction. Partly these impediments have biological causes\nand are not limited to modern societies. Other impediments\nare more typical for contemporary societies. First, as C&H indi-\ncate (sect. 5.3.), the parental investments required to enable a\nchild to compete with its peers have increased exponentially.\nThese high costs of children limit the number of children the\nparents can raise. Second, paid employment and motherhood\nare hard to reconcile. When women are confronted with the\ndilemma of combining work and motherhood, they tend to\nreduce their fertility. This phenomenon is reflected in total ferti-\nlity rates, which generally are lower in countries where work and\nmotherhood are less compatible (Hoem 2008; McDonald 2000).\nThird, the acceptance and large-scale use of contraceptives have\nmade fertility subject to conscious choice. In liberal societies,\nwomen\u2019s lifestyle preferences have a bigger impact on fertility\ndecisions. Women\u2019s preferences are heterogeneous and some\nwomen prefer to be \u201cchildfree\u201d (Hakim 2002; 2003).\nThe diverse impediments that women and couples face are\nlikely to affect their reproductive success. It is our hypothesis\nthat grandparental investments, especially investments in the\nform of childcare, alleviate these impediments and thus have a\npositive impetus on fertility. By reducing some of the burden\nof raising children, grandparental investments may lower the\ncosts of a child for the parents. Grandparental childcare may\nalso ease women\u2019s dilemma of combining paid employment\nand motherhood, and give the mother more possibilities to\nspend free time without the children. We tested this hypothesis\nin a representative sample of the contemporary Dutch older\npopulation for which information on grandparental babysitting,\nas well as the fertility of their children, was available. In this pro-\nspective study (yet unpublished), we found that grandparental\nchildcare support has a positive effect on their children\u2019s fertility.\nThis suggests that grandparental investments may also positively\naffect their children\u2019s fitness in a contemporary affluent society.\nA positive relationship between grandparental investments\nand children\u2019s fertility on an individual level is not at odds with\na negative relationship between grandparental investments and\nfertility on a population level as reported by C&H (sect. 8.3.),\nbut rather points to the importance of the institutional context\nin which grandparental investments take place. It may well be\nthat on a country level, grandparental childcare does not out-\nweigh fertility constraining factors. Our findings are limited to\na Dutch population and do not allow conclusions on the role of\ncontextual factors. But, like C&H, we think this is an important\nnew field of inquiry. Besides C&H\u2019s emphasis on the importance\nof economic and institutional factors, we want to stress that cul-\ntural factors may also be very important, both in shaping the pre-\nferences for care from grandparents, and in its impact on fertility.\nThe literature on European welfare state regimes (Esping-\nAndersen 1990; Pfau-Effinger 2005) typically links the availability\nof care to cultural traditions about the role of women and kin in\nproviding care. Roughly speaking, the farther south one gets, the\ngreater the responsibility of women for their children, and the\ngreater the reliance on kin for providing care. The northern\ncountries provide more formal arrangements. The Netherlands\nstands out for its relatively high availability of child-care in com-\nbination with a strong preference of many working women for\ncare from grandparents (Portegijs et al. 2006). This suggests\nfirst that the reliance on grandparents may be informed by cul-\ntural preferences, which are not only reflected in the institutional\ncare arrangements, but also in the choices individual parents\nmake.\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 29\nSecond, from an evolutionary perspective, the main question\nwould be how child-care arrangements affect fertility. Does it\nmake a difference if grandparents take care of the children, as\ncompared to non-kin or even relative strangers? Or have our col-\nlective institutions simply taken over the role of grandparents in\nour evolution, as C&H suggest? The latter could be the case if we\nsee our social institutions and society at large as an extension of\nthe kin groups that presumably existed when the grandmother\neffect first emerged in humans. Recent findings indicate that fer-\ntility may be increasing in better-developed welfare states (Myrs-\nkyla\u00a8 et al. 2009), and older generations often use the transfers\nthey receive from the welfare state to invest in their children\n(Kohli 1999). This suggests that the mechanisms behind interge-\nnerational transfers are similar at both macro and micro levels.\nHowever, C&H show that most evolutionary perspectives on\ngrandparental investments would predict a fitness advantage of\ntaking care of grandchildren. When, as in the Dutch case, grand-\nparents are willing to provide this care, and many parents prefer\nsuch care over other possibilities, it seems logical to expect that it\nalso makes a greater difference for the parents\u2019 fertility. In that\ncase, cultural preferences could reflect evolutionary advantages\nof grandparental care. The question then is if and why cultural\ndifferences occur in the relevance of grandparents for fertility.\nWe have no answers yet, and at this moment we only have one\nstudy to suggest that grandparents do matter for fitness in low-\nrisk countries. We hope this does make a case for further\nresearch on grandparental fitness effects, either by looking into\nthe parents\u2019 situation in more detail, or by comparing data\nfrom countries with contrasting child-care and cultural\nbackgrounds.\nIntergenerational transfers and the cost of\nallomothering in traditional societies\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991683\nKaren L. Kramer\nDepartment of Human Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge,\nMA 02138.\nkkramer@fas.harvard.edu\nAbstract: The question of why helpers help is debated in the cooperative\nbreeding literature. Recent reevaluations of inclusive fitness theory\nhave important implications for traditional populations in which the\nprovisioning of young occurs in the context of intergenerational\ntransfers. These transfers link older and younger generations in an\neconomic relationship that both minimizes the demand for help and\nthe cost of helping.\nGrandparental assistance in helping to raise their children\u2019s\nyoung is common in many industrialized and traditional societies\ntoday, and is hypothesized to be important in the evolution of\nmodern life histories (Hawkes & Paine 2006; Hawkes et al.\n1997). Coall & Hertwig (C&H) make a compelling case, both\nfor integrating evolutionary perspectives on grandparenting\nwith economic and sociological views, and for moving evolution-\nary models forward to explain grandparenting under post-demo-\ngraphic transition conditions. In doing so, they raise a number of\nsalient points about grandparenting specifically and allocare in\ngeneral.\nHumans have been characterized as cooperative breeders, a\nreproductive strategy in which mothers routinely rely on the\nhelp of nonparental individuals to raise young. Because allo-\nmothers divert energy and resources to another\u2019s reproductive\nsuccess, it presents an evolutionary puzzle. In addressing this,\nmuch of the cooperative breeding literature has centered on\nthe question of why helpers help. C&H evaluate grandparenting\nand its altruistic basis in industrialized populations. My comment\nfocuses on this question in traditional human societies.\nHamilton\u2019s Rule articulates the conditions under which altru-\nism and cooperation might evolve and provides a heuristic means\nto view allocare as an adaptive behavior. While Hamilton\u2019s Rule\nhas broad appeal as a framework to understand cooperative\nbreeding, the challenge has been to operationalize measures of\ncosts and benefits. Recent research has questioned whether the\ncost of helping may be overstated (Clutton-Brock 2002), and\nwhether kin-biased behaviors may be motivated by factors\nother than, or in addition to, kin selection (de Waal 2008; Silk\n2004). These reevaluations are particularly prescient for\nhumans living in subsistence economies where the provisioning\nof young occurs in the context of intergenerational transfers.\nBecause fitness payoffs are often time-delayed, C&H point out\nthat kin selection per se may be insufficient to motivate helping\nbehaviors (de Waal 2008). In contrast to the psychological mech-\nanisms overviewed in the target article, an alternative mechanism\nmay lie in intergenerational transfers of food and labor that\ncharacterizes subsistence economics. The human diet consists\nof a wide variety of foods, most of which require processing\nand specialized technology. In all traditional societies, resources\nand labor are pooled and transferred intergenerationally, but also\nbidirectionally (Kramer 2005b; Lee & Kramer 2002). These\ntransfers flow downward from older to younger generations,\nbut also upward from children to adults. Rarely does any individ-\nual of any age do all of the tasks necessary to grow, survive, and\nreproduce. This economic interdependence affects helping beha-\nviors in two ways. Children growing up in transitional economies\nare not as costly as they are often characterized, and bidirectional\ntransfers link older and younger generations in an economic\nrelationship that minimizes the opportunity cost to help.\nBecause dependency of human young extends into juvenility,\nthe energetic burden of supporting children often is assumed\nto increase in step. While children growing up in industrialized\nsocieties are \u201cgas guzzlers,\u201d they are not so in many traditional\nsocieties (Bliege Bird & Bird 2002; Blurton Jones et al. 1997;\nCain 1977; Kramer 2005b; Nag et al. 1978). Juveniles have a\ncomplex relationship with their caretakers. They may not have\nthe skills and body strength to perform all of the tasks necessary\nto survive, but in most traditional societies children provide some\nportion of what they need. For example, Hadza children provide\n50% of their caloric requirements by the age of five during some\nseasons (Blurton Jones et al. 1989). When subsistence work is\ndefined to include processing and household tasks, Maya girls\nproduce 50% of what they consume by the age of six (Robinson\nSullivan et al. 2008). But juveniles are also able to overproduce at\nsome tasks \u2013 fetching water, harvesting, fishing, collecting shell-\nfish, and foraging for fruit and nuts are good examples. At these\ntasks, children may meet not only their own consumption, but\ntheir surplus production contributes to the \u201ccommon pot\u201d\n(sensu Stecklov 1999) and is redistributed among members of\nthe sharing group. Although a greater cross-cultural sample is\nneeded, where bidirectional transfers have been quantified, chil-\ndren\u2019s subsistence effort and upward transfers allow mothers to\nraise more children than they otherwise could provision on\ntheir own (Kramer 2005a; Lee & Kramer 2002). In societies\nwhere children make economic contributions, not only do chil-\ndren underwrite part of their cost, but others, including older\nindividuals, benefit from their transfers as well.\nOlder adults in many traditional forager and agricultural\nsocieties produce surpluses that exceed the level of their own\nconsumption. Although they are net producers (Hawkes et al.\n1989; Kaplan 1994), they too rely on exchanges from others,\nincluding younger generations. In subsistence forager and agri-\ncultural economies where the time and effort spent in allo-provi-\nsioning is embedded in self-provisioning tasks (e.g., the time a\ngrandmother spends collecting roots or weaving a hammock\nthat she shares with a grandchild), the cost to subsidize grand-\nchildren may be relatively low. Although the intergenerational\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n30 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\ntransfer literature has focused on unidirectional flows and net\ncosts, subsistence economies function in a more nuanced and\nbidirectional manner. Grandparental helping behaviors such as\nchildcare are clear examples of altruistic allocare \u2013 activities\nthat benefit another but not the helper \u2013 and may be explained\nby kin selection. However, in humans much of what helpers\nprovide is food and other resources to juveniles. Because provi-\nsioning juveniles occurs in the context of general food sharing\nand labor cooperation and helpers also receive resources from\nothers including those they help, it introduces potential mutualis-\ntic benefits and other motivations..\nIn natural fertility populations, the help mothers receive has\nbeen associated with younger ages at first birth, shorter birth\nintervals, and higher offspring survival (Flinn 1988; Hawkes\net al. 1997; Kramer 2004; Turke 1988). Assistance, which tra-\nditionally came from grandparents and others, is today further\naugmented by governments and institutions. In many natural fer-\ntility populations today, through external sources of nutritional\nand medical assistance child survival has increased concomitant\nwith a rise in birth rates (Dyson & Murphy 1985; Kramer &\nGreaves 2007; Kramer & McMillan 2006; Romaniuk 1980). In\npost-demographic transition populations childbearing occurs\nmuch less often in a kin-based context. As generational time\nlengthens and families are more prone to geographic dispersion,\nchildrearing support networks often diminish or evaporate. Even\nthough families are small, help from others often is still essential,\nbut support shifts to nonkin-based assistance, paid childcare or\ninstitutional assistance. An interesting outcome is that, although\nmothers make allocation decisions and rely on help, the central\nevolutionary question about why helpers help is no longer\npertinent if caretakers are paid or otherwise compensated. In\npost-demographic transition populations, while traditional\ngrandparental roles may be supplanted, C&H point out that\ngrandparents continue to have an important effect on the fertility\ndecisions for working mothers and on their grandchildren\u2019s\nwell-being.\nPopulation aging and the economic role of the\nelderly: Bonanza or burden?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991695\nRonald D. Lee\nDepartment of Demography, University of California\u2013Berkeley, Berkeley, CA\n94720.\nrlee@demog.berkeley.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.ceda.berkeley.edu\/peoplenew\/rlee.html\nAbstract: As societies industrialize, the age profile of consumption tilts\nstrongly toward the elderly, while elder labor supply drops. Low\nfertility and long life lead to population aging. For millennia, material\nresources have, on net, flowed downward from older to younger within\npopulations, but now in many rich societies net flows have reversed\nand go upwards from young to old.\nThe population share of grandparents and other elderly is rising\naround the world as a result of low or falling fertility and rising\nlongevity, a share which, even in today\u2019s oldest countries, is pro-\njected to double or triple in coming decades. From the perspec-\ntive of hunter-gatherer societies, these abundant elderly should\nbe a bonanza for \u201cgas guzzling children\u201d and their parents. But\na funny thing has happened. The economic role of the elderly\nhas been radically transformed in rich industrial nations relative\nto contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, with low-income agri-\ncultural societies intermediate.\nFigure 1 plots the difference between the amount consumed at\neach age and the amount produced (measured as labor income)\nfor average individuals. This difference is the \u201clife cycle deficit,\u201d\nor LCD. The hunter-gatherer estimate is an average for the\nAche, Piro, and Macheguenga (Kaplan 1994) and !Kung\n(Howell, in press). The averages for rich countries (Japan,\nUnited States, Sweden, Finland) and for poor countries\n(Kenya, Philippines, Indonesia, and India) are taken from the\ninternational collaborative National Transfer Accounts project\nFigure 1 (Lee). Data for rich and poor countries taken from the National Transfer Accounts Project (NTA); see NTAccounts.org.\nData for the Ache, Piro, and Macheguenga are from Kaplan (1994), and for the !Kung from Howell (in press). Consumption in NTA\nproject countries includes privately purchased goods based on household surveys and publicly provided in-kind transfers (education,\nhealth care, long-term care, etc.), and is averaged across males and females. Labor income includes wages and salaries, fringe benefits,\nand labor\u2019s share of self-employment income, including unpaid family labor (see Lee et al. 2008). For hunter-gatherer groups, labor\nincome is food calories acquired (see Kaplan 1994; Howell, in press).\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 31\n(NTA) (see www.NTAccounts.org). This project estimates con-\nsumption, labor income, transfers, and asset-based economic\nactivity by age for 30 countries around the world, with complete\nresults currently available for about half of these.\nIn the hunter-gatherer groups, adults continue to be net pro-\nducers (negative LCD) until near time of death, transferring\nthe surplus calories to younger group members, presumably\nmainly relatives. The elderly are estimated to consume about\nthe same or less than other adults. In poor agricultural societies,\nadults of all ages consume similar amounts, but production falls\noff at earlier adult ages; so the elderly rely for their consumption\non transfers either from the public sector (although outside Latin\nAmerica public transfers in poor countries are very limited) or\nfrom their younger family members, with whom they often live.\nIn contrast to hunter-gatherer societies, in agricultural societies\nthere are typically property rights and property is disproportio-\nnately owned by the elderly. When the elderly own the family\nfarm or business, a share of family income accrues to them as\nproperty income, even if they work very little. The greatest con-\ntrast is with rich industrial societies that have highly developed\nwelfare states. Consumption by the elderly, particularly the\nvery old, is much higher than consumption by young adults, in\npart because of publicly provided health care and long-term\ncare. Labor income peaks later in the rich countries, depending\nmore on education and training than on physical exertion, but\nmost workers retire early in response to rising demand for\nleisure, the availability of pension benefits, and the incentive\nstructure of pensions. Consequently, the old age LCD rises\nstrongly in most rich countries. This reshaped human life cycle,\nwith a long and healthy old age of heavy consumption and little\nlabor effort, is a sea change.\nThese changes in the economic role of the elderly mean that a\npotential bonanza of helpful elderly has been transformed\ninstead into economic dependents competing with children for\nsocial resources. Throughout history, the net flow of material\nresources has been downward, from older to younger individuals.\nVery recently, this direction of net flow has been reversed in\nsome rich countries, and is very likely to be reversed in many\nmore as populations age. Figure 2 illustrates this point by plotting\narrows for each society, with the head of the arrow at the average\nage (population weighted) of consuming and the tail at the\naverage age of producing. The width of each arrow is pro-\nportional to the per capita consumption, scaled by average\nlabor income for ages 30 to 49. An arrow pointing to the left indi-\ncates resources flowing from older to younger, on average, while\nan arrow pointing to the right indicates resources flowing on net\nfrom younger to older. In hunter-gatherer groups in Kenya,\nSoutheast Asia, Latin America, and East Asia, the regional\narrows (shown in gray) and every individual arrow except for\nJapan point strongly to the left, indicating a net flow of resources\nto the young. However, in Japan, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, and\nGermany, and in the United States and Europe regions as a\nwhole, the arrows now point to the right. This is also a sea change.\nFigure 2 combines private transfers, public transfers, and the\nuse of assets to shift consumption. But a similar diagram\nrestricted solely to private transfers shows that these are strongly\nfrom older to younger in every one of these societies. It is the\npublic sector transfers that tilt the balance upwards in many\nrich countries. Furthermore, if we look specifically at transfer\npatterns of the elderly, we see that in every society outside of\nEast Asia and Thailand, the elderly make private transfers to\nyounger individuals, sometimes out of the public transfers they\nreceive, and sometimes out of their asset income. In addition,\nthe elderly in many countries make substantial bequests,\nanother important route through which resources are transferred\nto younger generations. The story is complex, but is consistent\nwith a strong motivation of the elderly to assist others privately,\neven while absorbing massive resources through the public\nsector.\nMeasures of grandparental investment as a\nlimiting factor in theoretical and empirical\nadvancement\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991701\nRichard L. Michalski\nDepartment of Psychology, Hollins University, Roanoke, VA 24020.\nrmichalski@hollins.edu\nAbstract: To refine our understanding of grandparental investment and\nits consequences, we need to understand what grandparents do for\ntheir grandchildren. Knowing the landscape of grandparental investment\nwill facilitate a better understanding of the impact of grandparental\ninvestment on grandchildren and will allow inroads to be made in\nbridging the different levels of analysis.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) call upon researchers to integrate their\nperspectives to advance our understanding of grandparental\ninvestment and its impact on the lives of grandchildren. Clarify-\ning what we mean by grandparental investment may be a worthy\nstep in this endeavor. A complete understanding of the nature\nof grandparental investment and the effects of grandparental\ninvestment on grandchildren will require a comprehensive\nFigure 2 (Lee).

Within each region, countries are ordered\nby per capita GDP, purchasing-parity adjusted.\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n32 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nunderstanding of what such investment is. C&H cite numerous\nstudies looking at the impact of grandparental investment on\nvarious outcomes for grandchildren. Most of these studies use\nmeasures of grandparental investment that are limited in scope\nand were likely valued because they were economical to\ninclude in large, representative studies. Such measures have out-\nlived their utility. Social distance, time\/contact frequency,\nmoney, care, and affection represent a sampling of the variables\nused in the studies cited by C&H. Grandparental investment, of\ncourse, can take many forms, which are highlighted in the target\narticle, but this list is not comprehensive and is inadequate. I will\nsingle out one variable.\nSpending time with grandchildren can be a useful variable in\nsome studies, but prospecting the behaviors that grandparents\nengage in while spending time with their grandchildren may\nprove more valuable in identifying the evolved psychological\nmechanisms producing these investments. Informing grandchil-\ndren about kin relationships and ancestors, offering advice,\nsettling disputes, providing encouragement, showing interest in\nthe activities of grandchildren are just a few of the things that\ngrandparents can do when spending time with grandchildren\n(Euler & Michalski 2007). These potentially revealing measures\nare masked when we use contact frequency as a sole measure\nof grandparental investment. Time spent with grandchildren in\na given period of time is a domain-general measure. Posing\ndomain-general questions thwarts our ability to identify the\ndomain-specific operation of evolved psychological mechanisms\nadapted for channeling investment to grandchildren. The use\nof such domain-general measures may be contributing to the dif-\nficulty researchers have in crossing interdisciplinary boundaries\nin order to advance our understanding of grandparental motiv-\nations. Contact frequency does not necessarily lend itself to a\nthorough integration of theoretical perspectives, nor does it\ninform us about what it is about contact frequency that may be\nassociated with developmental outcomes.\nC&H note that there is little to no convincing evidence of sex-\nbiased grandparental investment in humans. This statement may\nreflect the inadequacy of extant measures of grandparental\ninvestment. Grandparents may, for example, channel different\ninvestments toward granddaughters than to grandsons, but\nthese potential variables have not yet been empirically documen-\nted because of limitations in our tools for assessing grandparental\ninvestment. Examining the different types of grandparental\ninvestments will allow for more thorough examinations of econ-\nomic, sociological, anthropological, psychological, and biological\ndiscussion.\nWe also need to exercise care in interpreting reports of grand-\nparental investment. Grandparental, parental, and grandchild\nreports of grandparental investment may reveal variation attribu-\ntable to reporting biases. Appreciating the biases that may be\nprevalent in reports of grandparental investment will help us to\nbetter understand how grandparental investment is perceived\nby kin. In understanding which grandparents invest more than\nothers, for example, Euler et al. (2001) note that responses pro-\nvided by the recipients of investment may be more accurate,\nbecause grandparents may deceive themselves into believing\nthat they do not favor one or a few of their grandchildren.\nC&H note the empirical studies documenting biases of grand-\nparents toward grandchildren related through daughters than\nthrough sons and related through firstborns and lastborns than\nthrough middleborns. This evidence hints at the evolved psychol-\nogy of parents in mediating grandparental investment and the\nevolved psychology of grandparents by their responsiveness to\nparents. A goal of researchers studying grandparental investment\nmight be to better understand the role of parents in encouraging\n(or discouraging) grandparental investment. What do parents do\nto encourage grandparents to invest in their grandchildren? Does\nthis encouragement come at the expense of grandparents\u2019 invest-\nment budgets for grandchildren related through siblings of the\nparent? To my knowledge, there exists no study examining the\nways in which parents attempt to encourage their parents to\ninvest in grandchildren.\nThe type of investment that grandparents make should matter\nin the developmental outcomes of grandchildren, and may jump-\nstart the integration of different theoretical approaches to the\nstudy of grandparental investment. Understanding the nature\nof grandparental investment by means of knowledge of the\nevolved psychological mechanisms activated in the presence of\ngrandparents, parents, and grandchildren will amplify research\nefforts and further inform public policy decisions.\nThe evolutionary versus socio-economic view\non grandparenthood: What are the\ngrandparents\u2019 underlying motivations?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991713\nAlexander Pashos\nInstitute of Biology, Human Biology and Anthropology, Freie Universita\u00a8t Berlin,\n14195 Berlin, Germany.\npashos@zedat.fu-berlin.de\nhttp:\/\/www.biologie.fu-berlin.de\/humanbio\/alexander-pashos.htm\nAbstract: Coall & Hertwig (C&H) give an ambitious review about the\nbroad range of grandparenting literature from the perspective of\ndifferent disciplines. They aim to show, how evolutionary theory,\nsociology, and economics can mutually enrich each other. However, the\ndifferences between the evolutionary and the socio-economic\nperspective should be more clearly pointed out, because they usually\ndeal with different research questions. Grandparents\u2019 well-being could\nbe divided into its underlying components.\nCoall & Hertwig (C&H) comprehensively outline existing the-\nories, results, and interpretations regarding grandparental invest-\nment from the perspectives of three different disciplines:\nevolution, social sciences, and economics. Their overview is\ncareful and diligent, even though occasionally lengthy. A more\nclear-cut standpoint would be desirable. The authors could\ntake a more pronounced position, instead of trying to accommo-\ndate every point of view, especially when certain theoretical\ndifferences exist.\nEvolutionary versus socio-economic perspectives. The evol-\nutionary biology view and the socio-economic view differ signifi-\ncantly in one point. Evolutionary biology does not assume that\ngrandparents decide rationally when caring for grandchildren.\nMost behaviors are irrational, although humans have the ability\nto consider things from a rational point of view.\nHuman biology searches for universal behaviors and their\nvariety. These behaviors have emerged over the course of evol-\nution because they had an advantage for survival and reproduc-\ntion. Human behaviors are influenced by emotions and shaped\nby the social and cultural environment in which we grow up.\nWe learn from an early age what is expected from grandparents\nand their duties. This means that evolution affects human behav-\nior in terms of both inner motivations and cultural learning. This\nis because evolution also shapes cultural systems. Grandparental\nroles must be learned, such as mothering behavior, by obser-\nvation and experiences. This is not true only for humans, but\nalso for other mammals, not the least being other primates\n(e.g., Lancaster et al. 1971; Suomi 2003).\nSociology, by contrast, focuses on differences caused by social\nfactors and the economic framework: How is grandparental car-\negiving characterized within a society, given the socio-economic\nconditions? And what has changed over time? Biology and\nsociology, in fact, do not overlap; however, they can complement\neach other. C&H combine the different interdisciplinary\napproaches, although they could make different perspectives\nclearer. When sociologists and economists analyze bidirectional\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 33\nintergenerational transfers within a modern Western society or\nthe effects of government transfers, they have their focus on\ncertain conditions. Evolutionary biologists, however, research\nthe universal nature of human behavior, despite the different\nsocial-economical parameters.\nAsymmetric grandparental care-giving is one such universal\npattern that has been found in both sociology and evolutionary\nscience independently of each other. Here, analyses of the under-\nlying proximate mechanisms can be very helpful for an interpret-\nation on an ultimate level. A strong correlation between the\nparent\u2013grandparent relationship and the grandparents\u2019 care of\ngrandchildren has been found (Michalski & Shackelford 2005;\nPashos 2000; Steinbach & Henke 1998; see also Korchmaros &\nKenny 2001), which can also explain the variance in asymmetric\ncare-giving to a large degree (Pashos &McBurney 2008). Under-\nstanding family relationships is hence not only a sociological topic,\nbut also a key point for an evolutionary interpretation.\nThe Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis, or sex-biased grandparental\ninvestment, as it is called in the target article, should not be\nunderestimated when explaining male-biased grandparental\ninvestment, as found in some traditional patrilineal rural societies\n(King et al. 2003; Pashos 2000). In patrilateral systems, the\ninvestment in sons and grandsons appears to be superimposed\nupon the universal matrilineality of kin investment.\nSignificance of grandparents. Grandparental investment\ndeveloped in evolutionary history because this help was necess-\nary for the offspring\u2019s survival. In modern societies, there is an\ninstitutional infrastructure that supports parents with their child-\ncare. Is the role of the helping family therefore dispensable\nnowadays? C&H correctly conclude that the positive effect of\ngrandparental investment in Western societies should especially\nbe seen with regard to \u201csofter dimensions,\u201d such as cognitive and\nverbal skills during child development and emotional support.\nGrandparental investment involves solicitude, listening to pro-\nblems, telling stories, having daily phone contact, giving protec-\ntion and support, buying ice cream and toys, getting on one\u2019s\nknees to play with a toddler. These are universal grandparental\nroles, regardless of the economic conditions in a society. Thus,\ngrandparents are not only \u201csafeguards,\u201d \u201cwhen kids try to set\nfire to the carpet.\u201d The problem is that these so-called softer\ndimensions, which can benefit child development, are difficult\nto measure.\nInterpretations regarding the transfer of resources form grand-\nparents to children and grandchildren using large socio-economi-\ncal survey datasets must be done with care. Surveys such as\nSHARE or the German Aging Survey were not designed for evol-\nutionary approaches. The \u201cregular care\u201d in the SHARE study is\ndefined as \u201clooking after any grandchildren without the presence\nof the parents.\u201d That means that grandchild care can be equated\nwith babysitting here, not with grandparental investment in\ngeneral. Also, it was not recorded if the grandparents cared for\nall or only some of their grandchildren. An association of grand-\nparental investment and fertility rates therefore cannot be inter-\npreted with confidence, and is rather questionable.\nSignificance of grandparenthood for elderly people. Another\nimportant problem is the effects of grandparenthood on the\nelderly people. The authors draw a nonlinear relationship\nbetween grandchild care and grandparents\u2019 well-being. From\nan evolutionary theory point of view, the purpose of the math-\nematical function is not fully clear to me. Investment is always\ncostly. The advantage of kin investment lies in the inclusive-\nfitness benefit. When your child falls into freezing water, and\nyou jump after him, this is, of course, harmful to you. Grandchild\ncare can be exhausting, especially in the \u201chigh-risk\u201d context.\nSurely, it is no full substitute for parental care and the elderly\u2019s\npower is limited. Nevertheless, grandparents are often willing\nto sacrifice themselves for their grandchildren, more than other\nkin and non-kin.\nBut what are their motives? Well-being, life satisfaction, and\nhappiness could be more clearly distinguished. In a data analysis\nusing the German Aging Survey, I found that the existence of\ngrandchildren, and even of children, does not make elderly\npeople more satisfied with their lives (Pashos 2009). However,\ngrandchildren were very often listed as persons who give great\npleasure and happiness. Elderly people without grandchildren\nwere much less able to name persons who gave pleasure and hap-\npiness to them, especially with increasing age (Fig. 1). Grandpar-\nents also were on average somewhat less lonely than their\ngrandchildless counterparts.\nThese additional results suggest that the motivation for grand-\nparents to care must not necessarily be looked for in physical and\npsychological well-being or even the satisfaction with life. Grand-\nparenthood, however, does seem to have an emotional impact on\nelderly people. It might give them a happy feeling that they are\nstill needed.\nThe generation game is the cooperation game:\nThe role of grandparents in the timing of\nreproduction\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991725\nRebecca Seara and Thomas E.

The presence or absence of a supportive kin network could\nhelp explain why some women begin their reproductive careers \u201ctoo\nearly\u201d or \u201ctoo late.\u201d\nWe commend Coall & Hertwig (C&H) for addressing an under-\nresearched, but important, issue in the behavioural sciences.\nDemonstrating that grandparents matter in post-demographic\ntransition, low fertility\u2013low mortality societies is extremely\nuseful. We propose that this cooperative breeding framework\nmay help to explain variation in the timing of reproduction,\nwhich is currently of great concern to policy-makers in the devel-\noped world. Many developed countries, particularly the United\nStates and the United Kingdom, have strategies in place to\nreduce teenage pregnancy, seen as detrimental to the mother,\nchild, and society. Equally there is concern about some women\n\u201cforgetting\u201d to have children, by delaying first births until their\nfecundity has started to decline.\nRelatively early reproduction, including teenage pregnancy,\nmay result partly from a set of circumstances in which kinship\nnetworks are still intact and families less dispersed. The proximity\nand availability of potential grandparents and other close kin may\nsignal to women that early reproduction is feasible and desirable,\nas this has been a prerequisite for successful reproduction\nthroughout most of our species\u2019 history. In contrast, where\nwomen leave their kin networks in order to take advantage of\neducation and employment opportunities, they lose these\nsignals from supportive kin that reproduction is likely to be suc-\ncessful, resulting in delayed births.\nWithin the evolutionary literature, it is becoming accepted that\nearly reproduction is a strategy which makes sense under a par-\nticular set of socio-economic circumstances, where young women\nwho have few expectations of being able to increase their human\ncapital through education, for example, make the decision to allo-\ncate resources to reproduction (Johns et al, in submission). These\ndecisions clearly happen at a conscious level to some extent\n(Cater & Coleman 2006; Lee et al. 2004). However, it is also\nclear that exposure to specific risks during infancy and childhood\nalso contributes to early fertility in humans. Lack of paternal\ninvestment and low birthweight increase the likelihood of a\nteenage pregnancy markedly (Nettle et al. 2010) and appears\nto induce more rapid development leading to a smaller adult\nsize and earlier onset of menarche (Nettle et al., in submission).\nIn some populations, it appears that those women who begin\ntheir reproductive life sooner also reproduce more (see, e.g.,\nMinistry of Social Development, New Zealand, The Social\nReport 2009).\nC&H\u2019s demonstration that grandparents may be particularly\nbeneficial under conditions of duress, together with this overre-\npresentation of teenage pregnancy in low socio-economic status\n(SES) groups, suggests to us that the role of grandparents (i.e.,\nthe parents of the teenage mothers) should be conceptualized\nas a role under harsh conditions. It is possible that the presence\nof grandparental resources might be a \u201cdeciding\u201d factor in early\nfertility. Second, it would seem that cooperative breeding of\nthis sort may be linked to relatively high fertility rates. This\nleads us to speculate that the late and low fertility of higher\nSES women is perhaps a consequence of a shift away from coop-\nerative breeding strategies in which maternal grandparents play\nan important role.\nWomen who do choose to invest in their own human capital \u2013\nbeneficial in terms of increasing their ability to invest in their\nchildren \u2013 are less able to rely on a supportive kin network, as\nthey disperse from their families and as their kin, particularly\nparents, become less able to provide practical support with\ngrandchildren as they age. This results in an increase in the per-\nceived costs of child-raising, necessitating a delay in reproduction\nuntil women are in a secure enough financial position to buy in\nhelp from non-kin. Such a strategy may also involve relying\nmore on male support, so that additional delay may be intro-\nduced by waiting for a suitable partner willing and able to\ninvest in children. This delay may inadvertently result in no\nreproduction at all.\nSuch demographic shifts will be accompanied by changes in\nattitude. Lee et al. (2004) note that in communities with high\nteenage pregnancy rates, the culture is generally pro-natal and\nthere is often much anti-abortion sentiment. Parents of teenage\nmothers expose their daughters to a suite of beliefs that encou-\nrage reproduction, even in the case of an accidental or unplanned\npregnancy. Indeed, Lee et al. (2004) report that the number of\nabortions in teenage females from low socio-economic back-\ngrounds in the United Kingdom is significantly lower than that\nfor wealthy girls. Different fertility decisions are thus exposed,\nand the local culture clearly supports these decisions. This\nleaves open the question as to what wealthier putative grandpar-\nents are achieving through their less pro-natal belief systems.\nOne possibility is that by encouraging later, post-higher edu-\ncation fertility, higher SES grandparents-to-be are investing in\nthe quality of their grandchildren, necessary for economic\nsuccess in a competitive economy.\nThis also gives the possibility that an alternative explanation for\ndelayed fertility in certain groups of women is not that these\nwomen lack the support of their kin for reproduction, but that\nmaternal kin are actively encouraging women to delay until\nthey have invested sufficiently in their own human capital to be\nable to invest heavily in their offspring. Such grandparents may\nin fact be investing in their grandchildren, but perhaps in a differ-\nent currency \u2013 financial resources rather than childcare (and a\ndelay in their daughters\u2019 reproduction will allow them to accumu-\nlate more resources).\nHere, we are essentially applying Turke\u2019s (1989) and Newson\net al.\u2019s (2005) \u201ckin\u201d hypotheses for why modernisation universally\nresults in fertility decline: Modernisation is correlated with a\nmove away from kin-based communities, and greater association\nwith non-kin. Kin help therefore becomes less available and indi-\nviduals become less exposed to the pro-natalism of relatives,\nwhich results in a reduction in fertility. We suggest that similar\narguments can be used to explain fertility variation within, as\nwell as between, populations.\nC&H end their article by discussing the implications of grand-\nparental investment for fertility. We concur that this should be a\npriority for future research, and we are beginning such a pro-\ngramme ourselves (Rebecca Sear has recently been involved in\na project which demonstrated that British women who have\nclose kin in their social networks have earlier first births than\nthose with looser kin ties; Mathews & Sear, in preparation).\nWe add that a focus of research should be on the interactions\nbetween SES, grandparental investment, paternal investment,\nand fertility behaviour.\nAre humans cooperative breeders?: Most\nstudies of natural fertility populations do not\nsupport the grandmother hypothesis\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X09991749\nBeverly I.

We conducted a more detailed\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 35\nsummary of the same literature and found that the evidence in favor of\nbeneficial associations between grandparenting and child survival is\ngenerally weak or absent. The present state of the data on human\nalloparenting supports a more restricted use of the term \u201ccooperative\nbreeding.\u201d Human stem family situations with celibate helpers-at-the-\nnest can be described as cooperatively breeding, but the term is a poor\nfit to many human family systems.\nIn the target article, \u201cGrandparental investment: Past, present,\nand future,\u201d Coall & Hertwig (C&H) provide a synthesis of\nwidespread opinion on the evolutionary significance and\nunderpinnings of grandparental nepotism. Their review is\nthorough and can serve as a useful entre\u00b4e into the literature for\nresearchers from disparate disciplines. The conjoining of per-\nspectives from evolutionary biology, economics, and sociology\nis unique.\nAs first noted by Williams (1957), the long postmenopausal\nlifespan of women is an evolutionary enigma. Why should\nnatural selection have extended the lifespan beyond the end of\nfertility? C&H provide an excellent summary of the main two\nadaptive hypotheses: the Good Mother Hypothesis and the\nGrandmother Hypothesis. Here we will comment on the data\nbearing on grandparental investment in natural fertility popu-\nlations. A recent review (Sear & Mace 2008) scored studies\nwith a plus or a minus for whether or not the survival (or pres-\nence) of a particular kind of grandparent was associated with\nimproved child survival. Based on this simple dichotomization,\nSear and Mace conclude that: (1) \u201cat least one relative is ben-\neficial in almost all populations, suggesting that we are evolved\nto raise children as an extended family enterprise,\u201d (2) \u201cmaternal\ngrandmothers tend to improve child survival,\u201d and (3) \u201cpaternal\ngrandmothers are frequently beneficial but show rather more\nvariation than maternal grandmothers in their effects on\nchild survival\u201d (Sear &Mace 2008, p. 15). We attempted to repli-\ncate this review by looking up the same studies and generating a\ntable that included all findings, together with p values and effect\nsizes, regardless of whether they were significant (Table 1). We\nalso contacted the authors to request greater specificity\n(in regard to sample sizes, standard errors, and p-values) and\na meta-analysis of the results is in progress (Strassmann and\nKurapati, in preparation).\nIn contrast to the conclusions of Sear and Mace (2008), our\nassessment of these data is that (1) overall, nonsignificant findings\npredominate over significant findings, and this is true even in\nthe case of the maternal grandmother; (2) associations between\nthe paternal grandfather and child survival tended to be either\nnonsignificant or negative; (3) associations for the maternal\ngrandfather were overwhelmingly nonsignificant; and (4) in\nagreement with Sear and Mace, the situation for the paternal\ngrandmother was extremely variable, but more studies reported\npositive than negative associations, although many reported non-\nsignificant associations.\nThe data are correlational and claims of causation may not be\njustified, especially in the presence of so many nonsignificant\nfindings. It is also possible that beneficial effects of grandpar-\nents on child survival existed that were not discovered by the\ninvestigators. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that the weakness of\nthe evidence in favor of grandparenting is entirely on account\nof problems of study design. The same studies consistently\nreported strong evidence that maternal survival improves off-\nspring survival (Sear & Mace 2008), giving these studies some\ncredibility. Most of the children were living in patrilineal, patri-\nlocal populations; negative associations were also found in some\nmatrilineal, matrilocal situations (Sear 2008), but not others\n(Leonetti et al. 2005). Additional positive associations\nbetween grandparernal survival and child survival might have\nemerged if more matrilocal and foraging societies had been\nincluded, but this was not possible to test given the available lit-\nerature. Our review, like that of Sear and Mace (2008), focused\non grandparental survival and grandchild survival, and did not\nconsider other arenas for grandparental nepotism. In\nconclusion, as shown in Table 1, the data do not presently\nsupport the conclusion that \u201cThe presence of a maternal or\npaternal grandmother was associated with an increase in her\ngrandchildren\u2019s probability of surviving in 69% (9 of 13\nstudies) and in 53% (9 of 17 studies) of cases, respectively\u201d\n(target article, sect. 2.4, first paragraph).\nIf grandparents, including maternal grandmothers, are less\nimportant than has been argued, then the view that humans\nare a cooperatively breeding species (C&H in the target article;\nHrdy 2005b; Kramer 2005a) also requires reassessment. Space\ndoes not permit us to consider the evidence for sibling helpers,\nbut it is not stronger than that for grandparents. Child survival\nand growth is often negatively associated with family size\n(Lawson & Mace 2008; Strassmann & Gillespie 2002), which\npoints to sibling competition rather than cooperation. With\nthese concerns in mind, it is useful to consider the avian\nliterature.\nCockburn (2006) classified bird species as cooperatively\nbreeding if there is evidence that more than 10% of nests in\none or more populations are attended by more than two birds.\nBy this definition, cooperative breeding occurs in 9% of avian\nspecies (Cockburn 2006). Using Cockburn\u2019s definition, humans\nare cooperative breeders if at least two different populations\nhave regular alloparents in at least 10% of households. This con-\ndition is almost certainly met, since two populations out of the\ntotal number of human populations is not a high bar to meet.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no one has worked out what pro-\nportion of human societies in the past or the present need to have\nalloparenting (and to what extent) in order for humans to qualify\nas cooperative breeders. Such a calculation would force us to\nexpose implicit assumptions about the role of grandmothers\nand other extra-parental helpers.\nRather than using Cockburn\u2019s definition, we recommend a\nmore specific and restrictive definition of cooperative breeding\nwhen speaking of humans. The helper-at-the-nest phenomenon,\nwherein grown offspring remain on their natal territory (or farm)\nand help their siblings to raise nieces and nephews, provides a\nuseful analogy to the pattern of delayed marriage and celibacy\namong the 19th century rural Irish (Strassmann & Clarke 1998;\nsee also, Voland et al. 1991 for a German data set). Marriage\nand celibacy rates in rural Ireland were directly proportional to\nthe availability of farms, and unmarried\/non-inheriting siblings\noften stayed home as helpers, or at least as unpaid laborers.\nThis pattern is comparable to the ecological constraints on inde-\npendent reproduction in birds (Komdeur 1992; Pruett-Jones &\nLewis 1990; Strassmann & Clarke 1998).\nBy restricting the use of the term \u201ccooperative breeding\u201d to\nsituations wherein alloparental behavior is prevalent and direct\nreproduction is delayed or forfeited, we will be better able to\nclassify and to understand the diversity that exists in human\nfamily systems. In behavioral ecology it is more interesting to\nexamine the underlying causes of socioecological or cultural vari-\nation than to impose species typical generalizations that may\ncause us to ignore contrary evidence. At present, the evidence\nin favor of grandmothering is far weaker than has been generally\nacknowledged. The significance of the nearly global breakdown\nof the extended family and the widespread occurrence of auton-\nomous nuclear families, whether monogamous or polygynous,\nshows that cooperative breeding in humans is facultative. In a\nwide variety of contexts and countries, responsibility for child-\ncare falls overwhelmingly on the parents. If humans were\nbirds, most societies with nuclear families would not meet the\n10% criterion for alloparenting.\nUntil the evidence in favor of grandparents and other helpers\ngets stronger, we suggest that we reserve the term \u201ccooperative\nbreeding\u201d for those societies or family systems that seem to par-\nallel the cooperative breeding found in other species. We should\nalso take a closer look at the \u201cMother Hypothesis,\u201d as the data\nconvincingly show that maternal survival is crucial for offspring\nsurvival.\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n36 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nTable 1 (Strassmann & Kurapati).

Further,\nsome hypotheses have less plausibility and veridicality than others. This\npoint is illustrated with results that conflict previous conclusions from\nevolutionary psychology about differential grandparental investment.\nWe congratulate Coall & Hertwig (C&H) for their outstanding\ncontribution. It certainly will have a noticeable impact on the\nrespective research fields addressed therein. This work is a para-\nmount example of the far too rarely occurring theoretical inte-\ngration of work on one specific topic (here, grandparental\ninvestment) that is investigated across different disciplines and\nfrom distinct perspectives. This diversity of viewpoints is true\nfor grandparental investment, which is studied in sociology,\neconomics, as well as through the lenses of evolutionary theory,\nas applied in evolutionary psychology.\nAs C&H rightly conclude, significant parts of these literatures\nare distinct and at times disjointed and contradictory; are not well\nintegrated; and have few discernible tendencies for fruitful\nexchange amongst themselves. Although we appreciate the\ngeneral thrust of C&H\u2019s arguments, which calls for a broad inte-\ngration of different viewpoints, we feel this might go too far and\nmay well be \u201coverly friendly\u201d with respect to recent disparate\nviews regarding the nature of grandparental investment. Simply\nput, opposing views and competing explanations of which one\nwould rule out the opposite argument are unlikely to be\nequally plausible and hence both cannot be \u201ctrue.\u201d\nThis is, to some extent, reminiscent of past views (now out-\ndated and quite clearly rebutted) in an entirely different research\nfield, namely psychotherapy research. In the 1970s, this field\nbecame entrenched by opinions that now are encompassed by\nthe \u201cDodo Bird Phenomenon\u201d (alluding to the dodo figure\nappearing in Lewis Carroll\u2019s novel Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonder-\nland). Specifically, we now know that differential psychotherapy\nresearch (i.e., efficiency and efficacy studies comparing different\npsychotherapeutic schools, approaches, and techniques) erro-\nneously concluded that, like in Carroll\u2019s novel, \u201ceveryone has\nwon and all must have prizes\u201d (cf. Luborsky et al. 1975). These\nviews have subsequently been quite clearly rebutted (e.g.,\nBeutler 1991; Shadish & Sweeney 1991). With regard to oppos-\ning evidence about grandparental investment from the evolution-\nary, sociological, and economic literatures, there appears to be\nthe potential danger of a similar \u201cDodo Bird Phenomenon.\u201d\nThere is mounting evidence which suggests that important\nconclusions from the currently widespread evolutionary psycho-\nlogical reasoning about differential grandparental investment and\nsolicitude might not be veridical, but rather be a result of neg-\nlected effects of confounding variables. For example, age and\nresidential distance were found to be associated with investment\nand solicitude ratings, but were not statistically controlled in the\nstudies of Euler and Weitzel (1996), Steinbach and HenkeV\no\nla\nn\nd\n&\nB\ne\nis\ne\n2\n0\n0\n2\n(r\ne\nf\n5\nd\ne\nad\n,\nR\nR\n)\n\u2013\nG\ne\nrm\nan\ny\n(K\nru\nm\nm\nh\no\u00a8\nrn\n)\u0002\n0\n\u2013\n1\n2.\n48\n3,\n09\n5\n,\n0.\n01\n2\n0.\n82\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n1\n\u2013\n6\n0.\n58\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n0.\n61\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n6\n\u2013\n12\n0.\n36\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n0.\n67\n3,\n09\n5\n,\n0.\n10\n0\n12\n\u2013\n24\n1.\n24\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n0.\n78\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n24\n\u2013\n36\n1.\n94\n3,\n09\n5\n,\n0.\n05\n2\n1.\n01\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n36\n\u2013\n60\n1.\n06\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n0\n0.\n90\n3,\n09\n5\nn\n.s\n.\n0\n\u0002 T\not\nal\nsa\nm\np\nle\nsi\nze\n(n\not\nb\ny\nse\nx\nor\nag\ne)\n\u2021\nP\ner\nso\nn\n-y\nea\nrs\nCommentary\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 39\n(1998), and Pashos (2000). Specifically, evolutionary psychologi-\ncal research has introduced the notion that laterality effects are\nimportant in grandparental investment. There exist two distinct\ntypes of grandparents (matrilateral vs. patrilateral ones), which\nare distinguished by different degrees of paternity certainty,\nand thus, potentially different degrees of genetic relatedness\n(see target article, sect. 5.1.3.). Indeed, many studies conducted\nin modern industrialized nations (see target article, top of sect.\n2. and Note 4) have obtained a specific pattern in the ranking\nof grandparental investment, as recalled by adults using rating\nscales, such that the maternal grandmother seemed to care the\nmost, the maternal grandfather somewhat less, followed by the\npaternal grandmother, and then the paternal grandfather.\nElsewhere (Tran et al. 2009), we show that the well-known\nspousal age differences, combined with the equally pervasive sex\ndifferences in life expectancy, create noticeable differences in the\nexpected exposure time grandchildren have to their four grandpar-\nents. That is, due to the fact that grooms are generally older and\nbecome parents later in life than do brides, grandchildren have a\nshorter overlap in the number of years they could interact with\ngrandfathers than they do with grandmothers.\nIt is important to note that the ranking of expected exposure\ntime to the four grandparents follows exactly the above-\nmentioned ranking of recalled grandparental solicitude.\nClearly, total grandparental investment in grandchildren must\nbe limited by (and thus partly dependent on) the available time\nthat grandparents have for such investments in their grandchil-\ndren. Intriguingly, appropriate controls for exposure time,\naccounting for the two confounding variables noted earlier, sig-\nnificantly level the matrilateral bias in grandparental investment\n(Tran et al. 2009). We therefore conclude that the widely publi-\ncized matrilaterality effect of grandparental investment, as high-\nlighted in current evolutionary psychological literature, may well\nbe incorrect, or at least substantially overstated.\nThis finding has manifold ramifications and consequences. As\nfor one example, some researchers (e.g., Gaulin et al. 1997;\nRussell & Wells 1987) have used such retrospective, obviously\nbiased rating data of adults\u2019 recalled grandparental solicitude for\nestimating nonpaternity rates. Unsurprisingly, such calculations\nof putative nonpaternity rates have yielded grossly overstated and\nthus implausible values (10\u201320%) \u2013 which clearly indicates the\ninappropriateness of such rating data. In contrast, several recent\nsystematic reviews of nonpaternity rates among modern human\npopulations have convergently estimated these to be about 2\u20133%\n(Anderson 2006; Bellis et al. 2005; Voracek et al. 2008).\nOf further importance in this context, in their systematic\nreview of grandparental investment and physical and mental\nwell-being of grandchildren (sect. 5.1.), C&H cite studies (sect.\n5.1.2.) that found differential grandparental investment (i.e.,\nthe matrilateral bias therein) to be dissociated from the criterion\nvariables under scrutiny. This constitutes more counterevidence\nto current evolutionary psychological reasoning about the exist-\nence, importance, and consequences of differential grandparen-\ntal investment, as the allegedly differentiated pattern of\ngrandparental caring showed a lack of association with important\nlife outcomes in the grandchildren.\nHaving taken evolutionary psychological study findings as\nexamples for illustration, we therefore would suggest that the\nopposed views of sociology, economics, and evolutionary psychol-\nogy on grandparental investment appear hard to reconcile and to\nintegrate, as intended and anticipated by C&H. There may well\nbe no \u201cDodo Bird Phenomenon\u201d in these lines of research, and\nwe do not believe that \u201ceveryone has won and all must have\nprizes.\u201d At the very least, some of these competing hypotheses\nhave less plausibility and veridicality than others. Specifically,\nwe surmise that some important explanations and assertions in\nthis field based on current evolutionary psychology thinking\nmight be confounded or misleading, as they could be more par-\nsimoniously derived from quite simple facts of demography, as\nwe have elaborated here.\nAuthors\u2019 Response\nToward an integrative framework of\ngrandparental investment\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10000014\nDavid A.

We discusses obstacles \u2013 from misconceptions to poor\nmeasures \u2013 that stand in the way of such a framework and of a\nbetter understanding of the effects of grandparenting in the\ndeveloped world. We highlight new research directions that\nhave emerged from the commentaries, and we end by\ndiscussing some of the things in our target article about which\nwe may have been wrong.\nR1. Introduction\nOne main goal of our target article was to review the exist-\ning disparate accounts of grandparental investment and\nintergenerational transfers, and to make a case for an inte-\ngrative framework that promotes consilience among\npsychological, evolutionary, economic, and sociological\naccounts. Taking steps toward a multidisciplinary frame-\nwork is not easy, because the involved disciplines have\ndifferent goals, terminologies, assumptions, methods,\nand to some extent conflicting worldviews. Therefore, we\nare pleased that 18 commentators from the fields of\nanthropology, demography, economics, evolutionary\nbiology, evolutionary and developmental psychology, and\nsociology responded to our article. We thank the authors\nfor their generous comments, valuable insights, and\nhelpful suggestions. We are especially grateful to those\ncontributors who extended our understanding of research\non grandparental investment in new directions (see sect.\nR6). In our response, we first turn to our commentators\u2019\nviews concerning our vision of an integrative and multidis-\nciplinary framework. Throughout our reply, we also attend\nto our omissions, errors, and confusions, where appropri-\nate, as an antidote to the risk of simplifying too much in\nour attempt to bring together disparate accounts. Unfortu-\nnately, some good points made by individual commenta-\ntors \u2013 especially those with which we agree and\ntherefore feel less impelled to comment on \u2013 must go\nunaddressed.\nR2. Grandparental investment: Theory pluralism\nand theory integration\nMany commentators appear to agree with theoretical plur-\nalism and support our push for a multidisciplinary frame-\nwork in research on grandparental investment; some\nsay so explicitly (Fantino & Stolarz-Fantino; Huber;\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n40 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nVoracek, Tran, & Fisher [Voracek et al.]). Such an inte-\ngrative framework, however, does not mean that we have\nto believe that each hypothesis has equal explanatory\nweight (a position that Voracek et al. appear to attribute\nto us). Of course, the evidence should be allowed to sort\nthe wheat from the chaff. In this section, we clarify some\nreasons for the need of a multidisciplinary framework\n(R2.1), consider overlooked aspects that need to be\nincluded (R2.2), and address concerns regarding the prac-\nticality of a multidisciplinary framework (R2.3).\nR2.1. Why we need a multidisciplinary framework\nA multidisciplinary framework is not l\u2019art pour l\u2019art.\nGrandparental investments in industrialized societies are\npart of multilayered intergenerational transfers, both\nprivate and public. Consequently, what happens within\nfamilies cannot be divorced from public transfers via insti-\ntutions created by the social welfare state. Therefore, we\nare convinced that economic and sociological analyses of,\nfor example, public transfers need to be integrated with\nanalyses of private transfers. Moreover, both kinds of\ntransfers need to be combined with demographic analyses\nof fertility and mortality, and with psychological analyses\nof the health and well-being consequences for both the\nrecipients and the donors. No single discipline can do it\nall by itself.\nLee and Cox bring up the topic of public intergenera-\ntional transfers. In his compelling analysis, Lee shows\nthat in rich industrialized societies, consumption by\nolder adults (age 60 and above) \u2013 for example, in terms\nof health care, long-term care, and pensions \u2013 is much\nhigher than consumption by younger adults. In addition,\nolder adults\u2019 consumption exceeds their production\n(measured as labor earnings), a condition that in\nhunter\u2013gatherer societies is characteristic of childhood\nonly. According to Lee, this represents a paradigm shift\nin human history, with the net flow of material (in vivo)\nresources being reversed from downward to upward and\namounting to a relatively brief period of 30 years \u2013\nduring which adult Americans, for example, produce\nmore than they consume (Lee et al. 2006). As Lee stresses,\nhowever, this reversal has occurred for public, but not\nprivate, material transfers (see also, Kohli 1999).\nLee\u2019s analysis raises the question of how public and\nprivate transfers relate to each other: Do they complement\nor antagonize each other? Cox touches upon a concept\ndiscussed by economists and sociologists that is key in\nanswering this question: crowding out. Used in the\ncontext of intergenerational transfers, crowding out\ndescribes the displacement of private help within the\nfamily by public, institutionalized services. Various\nauthors have suspected crowding out as the cause\nbehind the weakening of intergenerational links within\nthe family (see the discussion in Ku\u00a8nemund & Rein\n1999). With the expansion of the welfare state, crowding\nout may occur for a wide range of private transfers, down-\nward and upward alike. Focusing on upward trans-\nfers, Brandt et al. (2009) analyzed the interaction of\nprivate and public aid in the context of support that chil-\ndren give to their elderly, ailing parents (an issue to\nwhich we return in sect. R6.2). Based on the SHARE\n(Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe)\ndata set, they analyzed the level of care that adult children\ngave a parent during the previous 12 months in 11 Euro-\npean countries. Their main finding was a division of\nlabor between private and public help: Specifically, pro-\nfessional services have taken over the medically more\ndemanding and physical help of dependent recipients\n(thus crowding out private activities). The adult children,\nin turn, tend to provide voluntary, and less intensive\nsupport (e.g., help in the household or in dealing with\nauthorities). On Brandt et al.\u2019s interpretation, public\nsupport thus does not generally displace private support,\nbut the services are divided, and the availability of a\npublic support system might actually stimulate (\u201ccrowd\nin\u201d) private support. When social and health services,\nhowever, are less available \u2013 as is the case in the Mediter-\nranean, relative to Scandinavian countries \u2013 children are\nmore likely to provide the intensive care that ailing\nparents require. Such demanding care, however, appears\nto exact a cost: It has been suggested that simultaneous\ncare for elderly parents and young children may overtax\nfamilies and contribute to the low fertility rate in Mediter-\nranean countries (Livi-Bacci 2001), which provide less\npublic and institutional support for both the raising of chil-\ndren and the care for elderly, ailing parents.\nTo the best of our knowledge, such an analysis of the\ninterplay between private and public transfers and their\nimpact on the dimensions of interest, including classic\nfitness indicators (e.g., fertility, childhood mortality, age\nat first reproduction) and psychological and economic\nindicators of health and well-being, has not yet been con-\nducted with regard to grandparental resources in the\ndeveloped world. Does public support \u2013 in terms of\nchild support, daycare facilities, and free education \u2013\ncrowd out private transfers from grandparents to grand-\nchildren (and their parents)? Alternatively, has a division\nof labor evolved, with time-intensive and demanding ser-\nvices being provided by public institutions (if available),\nallowing grandparents to step up other investments?\nRelatedly, to what extent do private transfers from grand-\nparents to grandchildren depend on public transfers such\nas institutionalized pension systems: In other words, what\nparts of the public transfers from employed adult children\nto retired grandparents are handed back to them via\ngrandchildren (see also, Kohli 1999)?\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive: In modern societies,\nprivate grandparental investments are intertwined with\nother intergenerational transfers. Investigating the conse-\nquences of these transfers on psychological, economic,\ndemographic, sociological, and medical dimensions and\nexamining the motivations underlying private, non-institu-\ntionalized transfers requires, so we believe, theory plural-\nism and theory integration.\nR2.2. Why we need lifespan developmental psychology\nHoppmann & Klumb remind us gently of an additional\nperspective on grandparental investment that needs to\nbe part of an integrative framework, namely, lifespan\ndevelopmental psychology (see also, Gurven & Schni-\nter). We wholeheartedly agree, and would also advocate\na similar approach in sociology, the study of the life\ncourse. Key to the lifespan development perspective is\nthe assumption that ontogenetic development extends\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 41\nacross all stages of the life course, from conception to\ndeath. One way to conceptualize development is in\nterms of demands and opportunities \u2013 or Havighurst\u2019s\n(1948\/1972) notion of developmental tasks \u2013 that individ-\nuals face as they move through life. One developmental\ntask associated with parenting and grandparenting is,\ncouched in Erikson\u2019s (1966) classic (and somewhat rigid)\nstage model of psychosocial development, the solution of\nthe conflict between generativity and stagnation. In our\nview, early and modern theories of lifespan development\npsychology \u2013 for instance, the selection, optimization,\nand compensation framework (Baltes 1997), or the socio-\nemotional-selectivity theory (Carstensen et al. 1999) \u2013\ncan bring three things to an integrative framework of\ngrandparental altruism: First, they can broaden our under-\nstanding of why grandparents care for younger gener-\nations. Second, they can offer hypotheses as to why such\nactivities can have tangible benefits for grandparents in\nterms of a sense of identity and accomplishments (an\nissue to which we return in sect. R6.1), and successful\naging. Third, they will be indispensible in understanding\nhow investments translate into psychological outcomes,\nin both grandchildren and grandparents. To this end, we\nhope that life-span development psychologists will dis-\ncover that grandparenting \u2013 a topic they have largely neg-\nlected so far \u2013 is worth their attention.\nR2.3. Necessary scrutiny and unnecessary\nmisconceptions\nVoracek et al. criticize us for being too accommodating of\nthe different theoretical perspectives and thus overlooking\nserious flaws in one or the other approach. According to\nthem, one potential flaw in the evolutionary literature is\nthe often-foundpatternof grandparental investment accord-\ning to which the maternal grandmother invests the most,\nfollowed by the maternal grandfather, the paternal grand-\nmother, and the paternal grandfather (see sect. 2.3 in our\ntarget article). Voracek et al. criticize evolutionary investi-\ngations reporting this pattern for not adjusting for potential\nconfounding factors such as grandparental age and residen-\ntial distance. Both might account for the apparently robust\nassociation between grandparental type and grandparental\ninvestment. We do, of course, agree that establishing the\nindependent effect of grandparent type by adjusting for\npotential confounders, such as grandparental age, health,\nwealth, and distance, is good practice. However, the\nseminal article reporting this pattern and cited by Voracek\net al. as a culprit (Euler & Weitzel 1996) recognized, inves-\ntigated, and found no evidence for a confounding role of\ngrandparental age and distance (pp. 46\u201348).\nIrrespective of the merits of the conjecture that evol-\nutionary investigations fail to control for likely confoun-\nders \u2013 one can find examples of better (e.g., Coall et al.\n2009; Pollet et al. 2009) and worse practice (Bishop\net al. 2009) \u2013 we have not advocated an \u201canything goes\u201d\napproach. Pursuing an integrative framework does not\nmean that we have to believe that each hypothesis has\nthe same merit and should not be subjected to empirical\nscrutiny. In fact, having one\u2019s favorite hypothesis\ninspected by researchers from other disciplines, with\ndifferent theoretical priors and methods, will make the\nhypothesis\u2019 merits, or lack thereof, more compelling.\nJoining forces toward building a multidisciplinary fra-\nmework sounds fine in theory, but can it work in practice?\nSome express doubts. The evolutionary psychologist\nEuler diagnoses among sociologists a \u201cresistance to bio-\nlogical accounts of human behavior,\u201d manifest in their\nlack of interest in lineage and gender effects. When read\nside-by-side, Euler\u2019s and Friedman & Hechter\u2019s com-\nmentaries show that the breakdown of communication\nacross disciplines in research on grandparental investment\nis most palpable between evolutionary psychology and\nsociology. This breakdown makes it possible that to one\ndegree or another we all hold outdated misunderstandings\nof the other discipline. Take the conjecture that sociol-\nogists rarely examine grandparental sex and lineage in\ntheir analyses. Although it may have been accurate in\nthe past, things are changing (e.g., Chan & Elder 2000;\nDubas 2001; Monserud 2008).\nChange would be ushered in even faster if we began to\nread and cite the other discipline\u2019s work in earnest. In a\nrecent citation analysis, we (Coall & Hertwig, submitted)\nfound mostly mutual neglect. Analyzing the reception of\nthree seminal articles authored by evolutionary research-\ners (Daly & Wilson 1980; Euler & Weitzel 1996; Hawkes\net al. 1998) and sociological researchers (Bengtson 2001;\nBengtson & Roberts 1991; Szinovacz 1998a), respectively,\nall of which explored intergenerational transfers and\nrelationships, we found that although they had been\ncited a total of 644 times, only on 22 occasions (3.4%)\nwere they cited by the other discipline. This disinterest\nin each other is most striking because the methodologies\nof each discipline, specifically in the areas of discriminative\ngrandparental solicitude (Euler &Weitzel 1996; Michalski\n& Shackelford 2005) and intergenerational solidarity (e.g.,\nMangen et al. 1988), are becoming more similar. More-\nover, the methodological rigor of sociology is likely to\nbenefit evolutionary investigations, and the theoretical fra-\nmework of evolutionary theory may widen the scope of\nhypotheses examined by sociologists. It is time to stop\npointing fingers, and to start benefiting from each other.\nNot surprisingly, the commentators most critical of our\ntarget article were those of whose theory of grandparental\ninvestment (Friedman et al. 2008) we were quite skeptical\n(see sect. 3.2 in our target article). We appreciate Fried-\nman & Hechter\u2019s commentary in which they put a\nnumber of misconceptions of the evolutionary view of\ngrandparental investment out into the open. We cannot\naddress all of these but focus on a few, and hope that\ntheir discussion can help in moving beyond them. Con-\ntrary to Friedman & Hechter\u2019s implication that massive\ninvestments into post-pubertal children in developed\nsocieties cannot be explained within an evolutionary fra-\nmework, let us point out that a quantity\u2013quality tradeoff\nis a key concept within evolutionary, demographic, and\neconomic accounts (see e.g., Kaptijn et al. 2010; Van\nBavel 2006). Specifically, in post-demographic transition\nsocieties, ensuring that descendants are competitive in\nemployment and mating markets means that investment\nextends way beyond puberty and often into the children\u2019s\nown parenthood. Such investments in the high\nwithin-population competitiveness of modern societies\nexact opportunity costs and consequences for the inves-\ntor\u2019s inclusive fitness, and, therefore, conform to Trivers\u2019\n(1972) definition of parental investment.\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n42 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nRelatedly, Friedman & Hechter also conjecture that\nthere is no satisfactory evolutionary explanation for the\ndeclining fertility in developed countries. Indeed, sociologists\nhave previously identified the demographic transition as a\nchallenge to evolutionary perspectives (e.g., Vining 1986).\nIn our view, this challenge has been met by theoretical\nreviews detailing evolutionary hypotheses (e.g., Borgerhoff\nMulder 1998) and by combining evolutionary and demo-\ngraphic expertise (e.g., Clarke & Low 2001). Currently, a\ncombination of hypotheses gives the strongest evolution-\nary account of the demographic transition (see Sear &\nDickins). This is not surprising because the demographic\ntransition takes different forms in response to the com-\nplexity of different ecological and social conditions (e.g.,\nKaptijn et al. 2010). We concede that even though a com-\nbination of hypotheses may give a more realistic represen-\ntation of the complex social changes taking place, it may\nsimultaneously leave the unfortunate impression that no\nsatisfactory evolutionary explanation exists.\nFinally, Friedman & Hechter ask why grandparents\ndo not limit their investment into their children and\nsimply assume that their children will do the same, given\nthat their objective, according to Friedman & Hechter\u2019s\nreading of the \u201cevolutionary model,\u201d is to maximize the\nwell-being of their children. There are different answers\nto this question. Let us give two. First, an important\nbasic distinction is that between classic and inclusive\nfitness. Introduced by Hamilton (1964), inclusive fitness\nemphasizes that an evolutionary perspective is not purely\nabout ensuring your own reproduction. Inclusive fitness\nis calculated from an individual\u2019s own reproductive\nsuccess (classic fitness) in combination with his effects\non the reproductive success of his relatives, each one\nweighted by the coefficient of relatedness. That is, individ-\nuals can get proportions of their genes into future gener-\nations by ensuring individuals who share some of their\ngenes by common descent survive and reproduce. This\ncan include children and grandchildren, but also nieces,\nnephews, and more distant relatives. Maximizing inclusive\nfitness is thus one possible explanation for why grandpar-\nents invest in kin other than their children (as detailed in\nterms of the grandmother hypothesis in sect. 1.2 of our\ntarget article). Another explanation for grandparental\naltruism that is also consistent with an evolutionary frame-\nwork is in terms of evolutionary continuity and the\nempathy mechanism (see sect 3.3 in our target article).\nPashos also harbors some misconceptions, in this case\nof his own field: evolutionary psychology. We are\npuzzled by his pronouncement that \u201cmost behaviors are\nirrational,\u201d leaving it open as to what notion of rationality\nhe may have in mind. He also draws a strict distinction\nbetween evolutionary and economic accounts of human\nbehavior, suggesting that evolutionary biologists discover\nhuman regularities devoid of economic conditions. We\ndisagree. Of course, economic and evolutionary concerns\nare related, and in contrast to Pashos\u2019 view, yes, evolution-\nary theorists do talk about economic and, more generally,\necological factors. Life history theory, a branch of evol-\nutionary ecology, is effectively evolutionary economics:\nthe allocation of limited resources among competing\ndemands during a finite lifetime for the greatest utility\n(in this case, reproductive success). Examples of evol-\nutionary-minded researchers describing regularities of\nhuman behavior in response to economic conditions are\nendless (see, e.g., Clarke & Lowe 2001). To name a few\nsuch regularities: In traditional and historical societies,\nmarriage rates and fertility patterns have been found to\ncorrelate with resource fluctuations. In most societies,\nmen have been demonstrated to use resources such as\nwealth and status to gain reproductive advantages. Child\nsurvival varies with socioeconomic status of the family,\nand child abandonment is related, among other factors,\nto economic conditions. Biased investment favoring\ndaughters over sons has been found to be dependent on\neconomic conditions. Indeed, the link between evolution-\nary and economic concepts may be the single existing\nbridge in the integrative framework that we envision.\nTrying to integrate disparate fields sounds easy in\ntheory, but is hard in practice. Each field has different cul-\ntures, conventions, and journals, and one is typically not\nfamiliar with the theoretical developments in the other dis-\nciplines. But exchange of ideas between anthropology,\ndemography, economics, psychology, sociology, and evol-\nutionary theorizing also promises substantial payoffs: It\ncan guide research and theory more effectively. We agree\nwith Friedman & Hechter, Hames, Michalski, and\nPashos that we need more and better data to test theories\nof grandparental investment. Ideally, future investigations\nwill be longitudinal, involve myriad process and outcome\nmeasures, and encompass several generations. In persuad-\ning grant institutions to fund such expensive studies, design-\ning them as interdisciplinary in nature may give them a\ndecisive edge in the scientific marketplace.\nR3. What do grandparents do, what should they\ndo, and what are the effects?\nGrandparental investments need not be invariably good.\nHoppmann & Klumb make this point, thus reinforcing\nthe differentiated evidence from traditional societies.\nAlthough the maternal grandmother has been suggested\nas the second most helpful adult family member behind\nthe mother in traditional societies, under some circum-\nstances this help can be detrimental (Sear & Mace\n2008). For example, whereas in the patrilineal Oromo of\nsouthern Ethiopia having a maternal grandmother\npresent increased survival of boys to three years of age\n(Gibson & Mace 2005), in the matrilineal Chewa of\nMalawi, the presence of a maternal grandmother\nreduced the probability of her granddaughter surviving\nto five years of age (Sear 2008). Likewise, in industrialized\nnations, the utility that grandparental investments have is\nhighly variable, as numerous commentators emphasized,\nand, again, it changes across cultures, even within industri-\nalized societies (Rosman & Yoshikawa 2001). It is patent\nthat not all grandparents invest in their grandchildren or\nare caring (Fantino & Stolarz-Fantino); that some\ngrandparents are in competition for the same limited\nresources as their grandchildren (Fawcett, van den\nBerg, Weissing, Park, & Buunk [Fawcett et al.];\nLee), and that when some grandparents help out, it may\nbe seen as interfering or implying parental incompetence\n(Hoppmann & Klumb). In order to better understand and\npredict which investments are beneficial and which are\ndetrimental, respectively, we agree with Michalski that\nwe need to better understand what contemporary grand-\nparents do with and for their grandchildren.\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 43\nR3.1. What do grandparents do with and for their\ngrandchildren?\nGrandparents can adopt many beneficial roles from story-\ntellers, family historians, conciliators, and advisors to being\nsources of encouragement, skill, knowledge, and even\nwisdom (Michalski and Gurven & Schniter). Yet, activi-\nties that grandparents share with their grandchildren can\nalso represent a mixed blessing. A paradigmatic example\nis one of the most common behaviors that grandparents\nand grandchildren share: watching television (Ho\u00a8pflinger\net al. 2006). In the best of all worlds, TV consumption\ncan be educational and foster intergenerational dialogue.\nAt the same time, it can foster a sedentary lifestyle. In a\nstudy of 84 Native American and African American\nthree-generation families, Polley et al. (2005) found that\na grandchild\u2019s bodymass index (BMI) was positively associ-\nated with grandparental BMI. Moreover, a higher grand-\nparental BMI was related to lower activity levels in the\ngrandchild and a lower grandparental activity level was\nassociated with more hours of television watching in the\ngrandchild. Although no attempt was made to establish\nthe independent contribution of these relationships (and\nthey are not surprising, considering the family clustering\nof BMI across three generations; Guillaume et al. 1995),\nthe study by Polley et al. highlights that researchers must\nmonitor carefully the activities in which grandparents\nand grandchildren engage. As Michalski points out, sum-\nmative measures \u2013 such as time spent with grandchild \u2013\nmay hide the sophisticated things that grandparents can\ndo, and, we would add, also the potentially detrimental\nactivities.\nConsequently, both Michalski and Hames demand\nmore detailed information and more detailed measures\nrepresenting the perspective of both donor and recipient \u2013\nonly then can progress be made in understanding the\nevolved psychological mechanisms by which the donations\nexert their influence. Relatedly, Euler emphasizes that\noutcome measures should be broadened to include such\nmeasures as grandparental and grandchild happiness.\nFriedman & Hechter take the issue of insufficient\nmeasures a step further and argue that the current lack of\nquality longitudinal data thwarts robust empirical tests of\nthe competing predictions from different theories. They\nappear to believe that sophisticated longitudinal investi-\ngations are unlikely in the near future. We are less pessi-\nmistic. There are recent longitudinal studies that promise\nto provide us with richer data, for example, the Millennium\nCohort Study (www.cls.ioe.ac.uk\/studies.asp?section \u00bc\n000100020001) or the Longitudinal Study of Australian\nChildren (www.aifs.gov.au\/growingup\/). Moreover, longi-\ntudinal studies are beginning to collect daily activity diaries\nthat detail information on specific behaviors at regular\nintervals throughout the day (Baxter & Smith 2009). We\nare currently on the brink of a data explosion that, if shared\nacross disciplines, will enable the grandparental investment\nfield of research to advance immeasurably.\nR3.2. How can we measure the effects?\nGurven & Schniter argue that research on grandparental\ninvestment implies causality but in reality often demon-\nstrates phenotypic correlations. They call for the explication\nand investigation of the proximate mechanisms that convert\ngrandparents\u2019 behavior into kin welfare consequences, thus\nrendering it possible to understand the impact of contem-\nporary grandparents\u2019 behaviors. We completely agree and\nalso stress that researchers need to be aware of and consider\nreverse causality. For illustration, consider the following\npossible causalities: (a) Do grandparents\u2019 investments\nimprove grandchildren\u2019s cognitive, social, and academic out-\ncomes, or are grandparentsmore attracted to and responsive\nto clever, friendlier grandchildren? (b) Do healthier grand-\nparents invest more resources in their grandchildren, or do\ngrandparents who invest more in their grandchildren\n(within reason) stay healthier? (c) Is livingwith grandparents\nbad for grandchildren (Chin & Xihua 2008; Marks 2006),\nor do grandparents begin living with grandchildren (e.g.,\nas custodial parents) because of a poor pre-existing environ-\nment that impacts grandchild development?\nUnfortunately, to make matters more complex, the\nmechanisms that broker the consequences of grandparen-\ntal behavior and kin welfare will depend on myriad con-\nditions such as pre-existing family environment. For\nexample, custodial grandparenting is commonly seen as\ndetrimental for both the grandchild\u2019s and the grandpar-\nent\u2019s well-being. How much of this association occurs\nbecause of what a grandparent actually does and how\nmuch arises because of the pre-existing family environ-\nment that precipitated the grandparent taking up this\nrole? In a longitudinal study of American adolescents,\nPittman (2007) examined the influence of a grandmother\u2019s\nchildcare responsibility and whether she co-resided with\nher grandchild, and the impact that had on the grand-\nchild\u2019s psychological adjustment. Crucially, Pittman\nadjusted for the grandchild\u2019s psychological adjustment at\nan earlier time point. Co-residing with a grandmother\nimproved psychological adjustment, but it decreased this\nif the grandparent was custodial. In a more detailed analy-\nsis, however, Pittman and Boswell (2007) demonstrated\nthat after moving into a custodial grandparent household\ngrandchildren actually showed improvement and exhib-\nited lower levels of internalizing behaviors (e.g., withdra-\nwal, depression, anxiety) as measured by the Child\nBehavior Checklist. One evident interpretation is that\ngrandparents become custodial grandparents under the\nmost difficult of conditions, which in themselves are\nassociated with poor childhood outcomes; nevertheless,\nthey still make a difference to their grandchildren\u2019s\npsychological development. From this follows the possi-\nbility that custodial grandparents could in reality provide\nvaluable resources that buffer grandchildren against\nthese stressors or moderate their impact. Similarly,\nHughes et al. (2007) showed that the negative health\neffects of being custodial grandparents were largely\nattributable to grandparents\u2019 pre-existing health and socio-\neconomic characteristics. Clearly, to reveal the authentic\neffects of grandparental behavior, we need \u2013 as Gurven\n& Schniter stress \u2013 a better understanding of the proxi-\nmate mechanisms, and in addition, the inclusion of pre-\nexisting environment and grandparent and grandchild\ncharacteristics in longitudinal study design.\nR3.3. What is optimal grandparental investment?\nComing from different angles, Cox and Fawcett et al.\nand Gurven & Schniter raise the question of how grand-\nparents should optimally invest their typically limited\nresources. Taking an economic perspective, Cox points\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n44 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\nout that grandparental help, like other economic goods or\nservices, is subject to the law of diminishing marginal\nutility. That is, the better off the grandchild, the smaller\nthe impact of an additional unit of grandparental help.\nFrom this follows that utility-maximizing grandparents\nshould distribute their resources such that they get the\nmost bang for their buck. In referring to our review of\nthe beneficial effects of grandparental resources in low-\nrisk and high-risk conditions, Cox suggests that diminish-\ning marginal utility explains why grandparenting confers\nless pronounced benefits in the former circumstances,\nrelative to the latter. Advocating a combination of evol-\nutionary and rational actor perspectives into one frame-\nwork (contrary to Pashos), Gurven & Schniter explicitly\nsuggest that grandparents should choose to allocate their\nbehavior optimally, such that it can have the highest mar-\nginal benefit (at lowest personal costs). As Cox suggests,\nhigh-risk contexts could represent circumstances under\nwhich the cost\u2013benefit tradeoff of grandparental\nresources are best, and, consistent with this possibility,\nGurven & Schniter report evidence that in a forager-hor-\nticulturalist society that they have studied, grandparents\noften become primary caretakers when parents die.\nWe entirely agree with the important role of marginal\ndiminishing utility. But in contrast to Cox\u2019s suggestion,\nwe believe it is too early to tell whether the relative lack\nof evidence for benefits of grandparental investment in\nlow-risk conditions is indeed a consequence of the fact\nthat grandchildren who do well simply derive less marginal\nutility from additional units of grandparental resources\nthan grandchildren who are worse off. There are just too\nfew published studies on the potential benefits of grand-\nparental resources in low-risk contexts. And their rarity\nmay reflect the reality of researchers and grant institutions\n\u201cinvesting\u201d in the study of high-risk conditions because\nthey hope for larger effect sizes and more impact in\ndomains with sociopolitical relevance (e.g., teenage preg-\nnancy). It could well be, however, that in industrialized\nsocieties where enormous investments into children are\nrequired in order to foster their success, investments\nunder low-risk conditions yield high returns on dimen-\nsions such as level of education and future income. The\nissue, then, is to figure out on which dimensions to look\nfor such high returns.\nLike Cox, Fawcett et al. also pick up on the theme of\nnonlinear returns of grandparental investment, and the\nquestion of how optimizing grandparents should distribute\ntheir resources. In their analysis, Fawcett et al. assume an\nevolutionary rather than an economic currency (i.e., \u201clife-\ntime reproductive success of the grandchild\u201d; see their\nFigure 1) that is to be optimized. They argue that\nTrivers\u2019 (1974) theory of parent\u2013offspring conflicts over\nthe allocation of parental resources can and should be\nextended to grandparental resources. Because a child is\nmore related to itself than to its siblings, it seeks a more\nskewed distribution of resources than parents, being\nequally related to all their children, are willing to grant.\nGiving each child some but not all resources also means\nthat parents invest their resources such that the invest-\nment yields relatively large marginal utilities. By extension,\nbecause a grandchild is more related to itself than to its\nsiblings or cousins, it desires to secure a larger piece of\nthe pie than the grandparents, being equally related to\nall of their children\u2019s children, are willing to give.\nExtending Trivers\u2019 (1974) framework to grandparental\nresources is an excellent idea. It will likely yield a set of\nnovel research questions (e.g., how do parents and grand-\nchildren attract and negotiate the allocation of grandparents\u2019\nresources?), and challenge a perhaps too rosy picture of the\ngrandparent\u2013grandchild relationship (see Friedman &\nHechter). However, a simple one-to-one mapping of\nTrivers\u2019 theory onto grandparental resources and their allo-\ncation is difficult, and the picturemay be evenmore compli-\ncated than suggested by Fawcett et al. for at least the\nfollowing reasons: First, the conflict over how to distribute\ngrandparental resources implicates three generations, and\nparents are likely to act as agents on behalf of their children.\nMichalski points out that there is not a single study explor-\ning how parents attempt to \u201cencourage\u201d their parents to\ninvest into their grandchildren. Moreover, parents\u2019 inter-\nmediate roles are complicated by the fact that one of the\nparents is biologically related to his or her siblings\u2019 offspring\nbut the other is not. In other words, parents themselves may\noperate on the basis of different biases or preferences,\ndepending on the lineage. Finally, the conflict over allo-\ncations between parents and offspring occurs in a context\nof relative transparency and information symmetry; that is,\nall parties tend to know all relevant information (e.g., a\nchild experiences how a parent treats its siblings). That is\nless likely to be the case for grandparental resources, with\na grandchild being less aware of howmuch time or resources\ngrandpa and grandma spend on her cousins.\nLet us conclude by pointing out that we completely\nagree with Hames\u2019 important point \u2013 which carries even\nmore weight in the context of a Triversian analysis of\ngrandparent\u2013parent\u2013grandchild conflicts \u2013 that research\non grandparental resources needs to better monitor not\nonly what grandparents do with grandchildren, but also\nwhat and how much grandparents invest beyond the\nfocal grandchild.\nR4. Why do helpers help?\nSeveral of the commentaries \u2013 Broadfield, Kramer,\nFantino & Stolarz-Fantino, Gurven & Schniter, and\nStrassmann & Kurapati \u2013 address the question of why\ngrandparents help. One explanation that has attracted\nwide attention is the grandmother hypothesis, according\nto which female grandparental investment and reproduc-\ntive senescence evolved because the intergenerational\ntransfer of affection, help, care, food, and wisdom\nincreases grandmothers\u2019 inclusive fitness. Broadfield\nargues against this ultimate mechanism and suggests that\neven though grandparental investment is beneficial in\nmodern societies, grandparental altruism is not an adap-\ntation, but an epiphenomenon of an extended lifespan.\nSpecifically, he argues that if menopause was selected\nfor to provide time for grandparental investment, one\nwould expect to see evidence of menopause in our\nclosest animal relatives. But there is none. Moreover, he\nsuggests that life expectancy into post-reproductive years\nis a recent phenomenon of the twentieth century.\nFirst and foremost, we agree with Broadfield that the\nexistence of benefits of grandparental care does not\nnecessitate grandparental investment to represent an\nevolved adaptation (see sect. 2.3 of our target article).\nNevertheless, we are not as convinced that the\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 45\ngrandmother hypothesis can be refuted on the grounds\noutlined in Broadfield\u2019s arguments. The evidence that\nhuman, chimpanzee, and gorilla follicle depletion rates\nare similar (Atsalis & Margulis 2008; Jones et al. 2007)\nsuggests that menopause in humans does have a phyloge-\nnetic legacy. Moreover, low life expectancy in historical\nand traditional societies obviously represents an aggregate\nmeasure, and is strongly skewed by those societies\u2019 high\ninfant mortality. That is, life expectancy at birth is simply\nnot the same as lifespan. True, life expectancy at birth\nwas less that 50 years in national populations until the\ntwentieth century (Oeppen & Vaupel 2002), but that\ndoes not mean that few lived beyond 50. As Oeppen and\nVaupel pointed out, increases in life expectancy until the\nmiddle of the twentieth century were due to large\nreductions in death rates at younger ages. So, what is the\nmortality signature of human adulthood (i.e., among\nthose who survived childhood)? According to Hawkes\n(2004; see also, Paine & Boldsen 2006), first, most girls\nin hunter\u2013gatherer and historical societies who survived\nchildhood continued to live past their child-bearing\nyears. Second, a third or more of women (of those who\nare over 15 years of age) usually live beyond the age of\n45. Broadfield\u2019s arguments are not compelling enough to\nput the grandmother hypothesis to rest \u2013 in particular,\nwhen taking into account that Gurven & Schniter\u2019s find-\nings indirectly address Broadfield\u2019s argument.\nGurven & Schniter show (see their Table 1) that two\nhunter\u2013gatherer societies and two modern societies\ndiffer in \u201cage at first grandparenting,\u201d namely, 38 years\n(hunter\u2013gatherers and acculturated hunter\u2013gatherers)\nversus 58.6 years (Spain) and 50 years (United States).\nWhat these numbers imply is that a long life expectancy\nis not necessary for grandparenting, and that our ances-\ntors \u2013 the only great ape simultaneously to raise more\nthan one dependent offspring (see Kramer) \u2013 possibly\nhad to decide simultaneously, all before their reproductive\nyears ended, in which of their offspring to invest their\nscarce resources (Kaplan et al. 2000) and whether to\ninvest in their grandchildren.\nHow are we to deal with this reproductive overlap and\nthe inescapable competition for resources necessary for\nreproduction? Overt competition for such resources has\nbeen demonstrated in other cooperatively breeding\nmammals (Clutton-Brock et al. 2006). For humans, Cant\nand Johnstone (2008) proposed that ceasing reproduction\nearly (menopause) might have been a way to minimize the\nreproductive overlap between generations, and thus,\nresource competition. Indeed, despite humans\u2019 high gen-\nerational overlap (see Gurven & Schniter), they show\nan extremely low level of reproductive overlap compared\nto other primates (Cant & Johnstone). By ceasing repro-\nduction early, grandmothers-to-be would reduce the\nreproductive conflict between generations, free up\nresources for younger reproducers, and boost their own\ninclusive fitness.\nConsistent with this hypothesis, overlap between a\nmother\u2019s reproductive period and that of her daughter is\nuncommon in humans (e.g., Flinn 1989). Should it\noccur, it has negative consequences for the growth and\nsurvival of grandchildren, as demonstrated in a study of\nnutritional status and mortality in rural Ethiopia. Sear\nand colleagues (2000) showed that the presence of\nmaternal grandmothers improved their grandchildren\u2019s\nnutritional status (weight and height) up to five years of\nage. The benefits of a maternal grandmother on height,\nhowever, was compromised in children whose maternal\ngrandmothers were still reproducing, with them being sig-\nnificantly shorter relative to those with a post-reproductive\nmaternal grandmother. In fact, their disadvantage was\nsimilar to that of children whose maternal grandmother\nhad died. The nutritional benefit translated into improved\nsurvival throughout childhood, an effect that was again\ncompromised (but did not reach statistical significance)\nin children whose grandmothers were still reproducing.\nIn section R7.3, we return to the grandmother hypothesis\nand to Strassmann & Kurapati\u2019s challenge to its empiri-\ncal foundation.\nStressing the economic reality of the relationship\nbetween generations, Kramer offers an alternative to\nthe grandmother and good-mother hypotheses and\nsuggests economic interdependency across generations\nas an explanation for grandparental investment. Specifi-\ncally, she proposes that in traditional societies dietary\nresources and labor are pooled and transferred from old\nto young, and vice versa. Moreover, children require\nfewer resources than previously thought, because they\nproduce some portion of what they need, and even over-\nproduce at some tasks. Consequently, the production con-\nditions of traditional forager and agricultural societies\nenforce a more equitable and directly reciprocal relation-\nship across generations than is typically assumed, thus\nreducing the costs of grandparental investment.\nBy depicting grandparental investment as part of\nan economic exchange,Kramer builds a bridge to the econ-\nomic accounts of intergenerational transfers. To consolidate\nthis bridge and to make the notion of a semi-equitable\nrelationship compelling, however, more data on the\nhuman economic life cycle are needed. According to Lee,\nfor example, hunter\u2013gatherers are estimated to become\nnet producers of calories as late as age 21, and continue to\nbe net producers of calories until near their time of death.\nIf grandparental investment were primarily explained in\nterms of the mutual benefits of reciprocated equitable\nfavors, thenwould one not expect amorebalanced allocation\nof resources between young and elderly?\nFantino & Stolarz-Fantino offer still another route\ntoward grandparental altruism, learning, and reinforce-\nment principles. In doing so, they provide a bridge to\nthe economic literature that deserves to be explored. In\nthe economic literature on intergenerational transfers,\nlearning principles have, for example, been invoked in\nthe demonstration-effect hypothesis (Cox & Stark 2005),\naccording to which, parents who expect to require care\nand support in old age have an incentive to demonstrate\nsuch behavior toward their own parents. The target audi-\nence is their children. By observing this model of behavior\nand the consequences, so the argument goes, the children\nwill be inclined to follow suit and imitate these transfers in\nthe future.\nFantino & Stolarz-Fantino also suggest that many of\nus operate on the basis of a generalized social belief that\n\u201cwhat goes around, comes around.\u201d Such a domain-\ngeneral belief suggests that not every act of altruism,\ngrandparental or otherwise, needs to be directly recipro-\ncated for such behavior to be maintained. Postulating\nthis belief, of course, raises the question of how and why\nit was learned. Moreover, is it, for instance, a function of\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n46 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\n\u201cpayoff to cooperation in everyday life\u201d or \u201cmarket inte-\ngration\u201d \u2013 two cultural dimensions that have been shown\nto affect the level of prosociality expressed in experimental\ngames (Henrich et al. 2005)?\nR5. Grandparental investment in industrialized\nsocieties and reproductive success\nOur starting premise was that in industrialized societies,\ncharacterized by a postmodern regime of low fertility and\nmortality, the effects of grandparental investments will\nmost likely not be observed on classic fitness indicators.\nInstead, we suspected that they may be found in terms\nof less tangible dimensions, such as the grandchildren\u2019s\ncognitive and verbal ability, mental health, and well-\nbeing. Notwithstanding this population-wide regularity,\nin section 7.3 of our article, we speculated and presented\ninitial data that within subgroups of a population there\nmay be links between grandparental care and fertility.\nSpecifically, parents of working mothers may be key to\ntheir daughters\u2019 decision to have children, in particular\nin countries with modest state-financed infrastructure\nfor childcare (e.g., daycare). Several commentators \u2013\nHoppmann & Klumb and Kaptijn & Thomese (but\nsee Pashos) \u2013 support this thesis. According to Hopp-\nmann & Klumb, grandparents can help their children\nto orchestrate the conflicting demands of production\nand reproduction, and avoid the frustrating choice\nbetween motherhood and career. Kaptijn & Thomese\nreport having found a link between the availability of\ngrandparental childcare and their children\u2019s fertility in\na Dutch sample. They also emphasize the role of\nparents\u2019 preferences concerning childcare: Even with\nstate-subsidized infrastructure for childcare in place,\nprevailing cultural norms may, for example, value\nprivate (e.g., grandparental care) over public childcare,\nthus causing a positive link between grandparental\nresources and fertility.\nKaptijn & Thomese also gently remind us that fertility\nand child mortality are not the be-all-and-end-all of repro-\nductive success, and indicators such as age at first repro-\nduction may, on a population level, still be associated\nwith grandparental investment in industrialized societies.\nWe agree. In fact, we believe that it is helpful to concep-\ntualize grandparental investment not purely as post-repro-\nductive investment, but also as part of the grandparents\u2019\nlifetime reproductive strategy. A life history perspective\nsuggests that for individuals who develop in a harsh\nenvironment, it may be adaptive to reproduce earlier,\nhave more descendants, and invest fewer resources in\neach descendant (see Sear & Dickins; Coall & Chisholm\n2010). Consistent with this, we found that grandparents\nwho had their first child and first grandchild at a\nyounger age invested fewer resources in a focal grand-\nchild. Moreover, this association was partially mediated\nby the higher number of children and grandchildren that\nthese early reproducing grandparents\u2019 had (Coall et al.\n2009). This initial evidence indicates that examining\ngrandparental investment as the final stage of grandpar-\nents\u2019 own reproductive strategies could be a fruitful\nresearch heuristic.\nOn a practical level, age of first reproduction is impor-\ntant because, as Sear & Dickins point out, timing of\nreproduction is of great concern for policy-makers in\nthe developed world, with the two opposite poles,\nnamely, teenage pregnancy and delaying reproduction\nto a point when declining fecundity requires the help of\nthe booming fertility industry. On a theoretical level,\nage of reproduction is challenging because its association\nwith grandparental investment may not be as linear as it\nhas been observed to be in historical and traditional\nsocieties (see Kramer). For example, in their classic\nstudy of the influence that grandmothers had in two his-\ntorical populations, Lahdenpera\u00a8 et al. (2004) found that\nhaving a grandmother present at the time her offspring\n(son or daughter) began to reproduce was associated\nwith a 2.4-year earlier age at first reproduction. Grand-\nmothers thus, so the interpretation goes, provide\nadditional resources that improve the parents\u2019 condition\nand increase the probability of earlier reproduction. In\ncontrast, in industrialized societies, as Sear & Dickins\nsuggest, the influence of grandparental investment\ncould be two-fold: It could delay age of first reproduction\nif affluent parents and grandparents-to-be were to invest\nin the quality of their grandchildren by supporting\ndelayed, post-higher-education family planning of their\nchildren. Conversely, grandparental investment could\nbring forward the age of first reproduction if, in contexts\nof low socioeconomic status, the presence of grandpar-\nents were to signal to women that early reproduction is\nfeasible. Currently, there is little direct evidence in\nsupport of the latter \u201ckin\u201d hypothesis, which appears to\nbe partially in conflict with the finding that a lack of\npaternal investment markedly increases the likelihood\nof teenage pregnancy.\nTo conclude, whether or not grandparental investment\nin industrialized societies still impacts fertility and other\nclassic fitness variables such as age of first reproduction\nis an exciting research question (see Sear & Dickins).\nMoreover, unlike Pashos, we see grandparental childcare\nas a crucial measure of grandparental investment. Depen-\ndent on the availability of state-subsidized childcare and\ncultural norms concerning private and public childcare,\nthere are indications that grandparental care has fitness\nconsequences even in industrialized societies. This associ-\nation is likely to become more pronounced during difficult\ntimes. The current global economic crisis \u2013 draining state\ncoffers and imposing financial sacrifices on many with jobs\nas well as those out of work \u2013 may make it more likely that\nparents turn to family for childcare assistance. How exten-\nsive the effect of grandparental childcare is on fertility\ndecisions will depend on the myriad interactions of\npublic policy, availability of institutionalized childcare,\nrates of women\u2019s participation in the workforce, flexible\nworking hours, and fertility. This is exactly the basket of\nvariables that requires \u2013 no, demands \u2013 amultidisciplinary\nframework.\nR6. Key questions for future research\nReading the commentaries provided a unique opportunity\nto recognize some new and exciting research directions.\nBecause of space limitations, we must be selective, and\nsome new research questions that we have already\ntouched upon will not be repeated here (e.g., the relation-\nship of private and public transfers, and the issue of\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 47\ncrowding in and out; the relationship between life-history\nindicators and grandparental investment in the modern\nworld).\nR6.1. Being a helping grandparent pays\nOur focus and that of most research on grandparental\ninvestment has been weighted towards the effects of\ngrandparental investment on grandchildren; however, it\nis clear that grandparental investment is not a one-way\nstreet (see sect. 7.2 in our target article). Several com-\nmentators elaborate on the potential benefits that grand-\nparents may gain from their good deeds and the\nrelationship with their children and grandchildren.\nEuler points out a valuable finding that we missed in\nTinsley and Parke (1987), namely, that grandparents\nreported significantly greater satisfaction with their\ncontact with children and grandchildren than the\nparents did (p. 270). Taking an evolutionary perspective,\nEuler suggests that \u201cnepotistic effort\u201d reflects an impor-\ntant \u201clife effort\u201d during the sunset years, and therefore,\nthat such behavior is inherently rewarding. What is strik-\ning to us is that Euler\u2019s thesis could also have been\ncouched in terms of a lifespan developmental approach,\nwhich Hoppmann & Klumb advocate.\nTo this end, grandparenting has been recognized as an\neffective activity that can meet the generative needs of\nolder people (Fisher 1995). In an Australian study of\ngrandparent satisfaction, it was the psychological\naspects of grandparenting \u2013 including generative con-\ncerns, the centrality of the grandparenting role to the\nindividual, and being valued as an elder by their grand-\nchildren \u2013 that predicted satisfaction (Thiele & Whelan\n2008). In contrast, the number of hours per week that\nthe grandparent provided childcare was not predictive\nof satisfaction. Apparently, contact alone is not enough\nfor grandparents to be satisfied with their role; rather,\nit is the meaning and generativity surrounding this\ncontact that matters. One reason could be that older\npeople, faced with the prospect of a limited future,\nseek emotionally meaningful experiences (Carstensen\net al. 1999), and prioritize generative and emotionally\nmeaningful goals (Lang & Carstensen 2002).\nThese and related results suggest that grandparenting\n\u2013 provided that people still enjoy the physical and mental\nresources necessary \u2013 represents the conduit for\nemotionally gratifying experiences that older people,\nattempting to regulate their emotions via meaningful\nactivities, seek out. Clearly, the exact psychological and\nneural mechanisms need to be worked out. However, if\neven mandatory, tax-like transfers to a charity elicit\nneural activity in areas linked to reward processing\n(Harbaugh et al. 2007), we would be surprised if grand-\nparents, voluntarily donating their resources to their\nkin, did not also receive payback in terms of some\nneural reward currency.\nR6.2. How can one explain young kin\u2019s altruism towards\nelders?\nCox points out that younger generations\u2019 investments\ninto ailing grandparents pose a conceptual difficulty for\nkin selection theory, and, perhaps because of this, have\nattracted little attention in the evolutionary literature.\nWe agree that the evolutionary logic favors downward\nintergenerational transfers because the reproductive\nvalue of younger individuals is generally higher than\nthat of older members in a society (Frank 1998). Conse-\nquently, understanding why individuals help older\npeople may not be best achieved from a \u201cgene\u2019s-eye\nview.\u201d Economists, for example, have proposed accounts\nsuch as the demonstration-effect hypothesis (Cox & Stark\n2005) and the strategic-bequest hypothesis (Bernheimet al.\n1985), which predict that resources flow from young (even if\nthe young are selfish) to older generations. Another poten-\ntially fruitful direction in which one may find partial\nanswers is the mechanism of empathy (see sect. 4.3 of our\ntarget article).\nPerhaps one of the greatest achievements of moderniz-\nation is that societies have built institutions that implement\npublic transfers to the elderly, thus sparing them poverty,\nneglect, and possibly geronticide (which according to\nGurven & Schniter is commonly practiced in pre-indus-\ntrial societies). As a result, the economic role of the elderly\nhas been radically changed, with, as Lee points out, a long\nand healthy old age of extensive consumption and little\nlabor. One topic that repeatedly emerges in public dis-\ncourse is whether the enormous public resource flow to\nthe older generations is sustainable in light of the large\nchanges in the frequency of old and very old in the devel-\noped world (Oeppen & Vaupel 2002). In this context, one\nmay also ask to what extent the very existence of the substan-\ntial private transfers from the old to the young persuades the\nyounger generations to support and accept what Lee ident-\nifies as the changed economic role of the elderly.\nR6.3. How does what grandparents offer change over\ntime?\nHames suggests that the grandparental resources being\ntransferred are need-sensitive; that is, initial investments\nare likely to be in the form of direct grandparental care,\nsuch as babysitting. When grandchildren grow older, mon-\netary resources, such as assistance in higher education,\nmay become more pertinent. What is interesting about\nthis plausible hypothesis is that such need- and age-depen-\ndent changes in resources may also reflect the capabilities\nof the aging grandparents. They babysit when they are still\nrelatively young, and transfer monetary resources when\ntheir ailing health makes it increasingly impossible to be\ndirectly involved. Age of grandparents and grandchildren,\nof course, is a variable associated with a number of\nchanges worth studying. For example, contact, but not\nnecessarily closeness, in the grandparent\u2013grandchild\nrelationship decreases as children grow up (Dench &\nOgg 2002; but see also, Bridges et al. 2007). With both\ngenerations getting older, their views of each other\nchange (Kahana & Kahana 1970), which, in turn, is\nlikely to affect how grandchildren try to elicit investment,\nand what type of investment grandparents offer.\nR6.4. Beyond classic fitness indicators in investigations\nof traditional societies\nIn order to find the effects of grandparental investments in\nindustrialized societies, we recommended focusing on\ndimensions such as the grandchildren\u2019s cognitive and\nverbal ability, mental health, and well-being. This is in\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\n48 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1\ncontrast to evolutionary psychologists\u2019 and anthropologists\u2019\nfocus on classic fitness indicators in traditional societies.\nGurven & Schniter rightly point out that dimensions\nbeyond fitness indicators (e.g., transfer of knowledge)\nalso deserve to be studied in traditional societies, even\nmore so because such societies epitomize high-risk con-\ntexts, in which the most important grandparental\nresource \u2013 in particular, later in the child\u2019s life \u2013 may\nnot be calories but, for example, skills.\nR7. Things we got wrong, or did we?\nOur target article was admittedly ambitious, trying to bring\ntogether evidence and explanations of grandparental\ninvestment stemming from different disciplines. In doing\nso, we entered territory new to us, and therefore omissions\nand errors may have been inevitable. In previous sections,\nwe have addressed oversights as the opportunity arose.\nNow we turn to three broader challenges to some general-\nizations we proposed.\nR7.1. Do grandparents have more or less opportunity to\ncare in industrialized societies?\nGurven & Schniter argue that grandparental opportunity\nwas higher in hunter\u2013gatherer societies than in modern\nindustrialized societies, contrary to our conclusion. We\nappreciate their analysis of demographic parameters across\ndifferent societies. At the same time, however, we also\ncaution against overrating the parameters\u2019 value, as they\nfail to recognize several important properties of grandpar-\nents and of grandparents\u2019 environments in industrial\nsocieties that are likely to increase the opportunity to\ninvest. First, today\u2019s grandparents are likely to be healthier\nthan their predecessors and invest over a longer period.\nSecond, they have more resources (in particular, through\nthe enormous institutional upward transfers that they\nreceive; see Lee). Third, they have substantially fewer\ngrandchildren in whom to invest (see the total fertility rate\nin Gurven & Schniter\u2019s Table 1), and therefore, there is\nless competition for grandparental resources within gener-\nations. Fourth, the wider-spaced generations are likely to\nreduce competition for grandparental resources between\ngenerations (seeFawcett et al.). Based on these differences\nbetween grandparenting in the past and today, we believe\nthat our conclusion \u2013 that the opportunity for grandparents\nto care is higher than ever \u2013 still holds.\nR7.2. How traditional are modern societies?\nHuber takes us to task for arguing that in industrialized\nsocieties many of the links that held in ancestral times \u2013\nlinks between grandparental help and inclusive fitness,\nlinks between economic status and reproductive success,\nand sex-biased grandparental investment (Trivers-\nWillard theory) \u2013 still hold. The links are more hidden,\nbut they are still there. We respect Huber\u2019s conviction in\nthe robustness of evolutionary regularities in modern\nsocieties, and agree that trying to uncover them, should\nthey still exist, is a worthy research enterprise.\nR7.3. Are grandparents helpful or not?\nStrassmann & Kurapati provide a thorough analysis,\nwhich they suggest shows \u2013 in contrast to a previous\nreview (Sear & Mace 2008) on which we relied heavily \u2013\nthat grandparents in traditional societies are not, or not\nstrongly, beneficial when measured in terms of child survi-\nval. Therefore, so they conclude, referring to humans as\ncooperative breeders is misplaced, or at least overempha-\nsized. Specifically, Strassmann & Kurapati expand Sear\nand Mace\u2019s review by detailing and quantifying all associ-\nations between each of the four grandparent types being\npresent (or alive) and grandchild survival, which is split\nfurther into effects on grandsons and granddaughters.\nWith the space limitations, Strassmann & Kurapati\nobviously had little opportunity to detail their procedure,\nand therefore, it is difficult for us to evaluate their analysis\nin detail. However, let us share some of our observations.\nAccording to Strassmann & Kurapati, most of the\nassociations between the maternal grandmother, the\ngrandparent whose impact should be largest, and child\nsurvival are non-significant. This is indeed true in 73%\nof analyses. However, the remaining associations were\noverwhelmingly positive, rather than negative (22% vs.\n0.5%). This is unlikely to be a chance finding. We also\nnoticed that the negative effect of the maternal grand-\nmother found by Beise (2005), with a relative risk of\n0.79, was taken to be statistically significant at p , .1 for\ngirls, whereas the positive effect of the maternal grand-\nmother found by Gibson and Mace (2005), with an odds\nratio of 0.714 (and, on inspection of Table 1 in their orig-\ninal article [p. 474], a 95% confidence interval that does\nnot cross 1 [0.51\u20130.99]), was taken to be non-significant\nfor boys. For others to replicate Strassmann & Kurapati\u2019s\nanalysis, it would be important to know the standards that\nthe authors applied (which could, for example, be made\naccessible in a document on their website).\nA final observation that we made is that Strassmann &\nKurapati\u2019s detailed analysis should encourage researchers\nto specify the time course of the predicted effects more\nprecisely, and thus to test them more stringently. Take,\nfor illustration, the Beise (2005) data set. It shows that\nthe maternal grandmother has no effect from 0\u201311\nmonths of age, which is when most infants are being\nbreastfed; it has a positive effect in three out of four ana-\nlyses between 12 and 36 months of age, when provisioning\nof children moves to alloparents, and becomes negative\nonly for girls between 36 and 59 months of age. Obviously,\nour summary is post-hoc, but it does suggest that the initial\nlack of effects and the subsequent positive effects could be\nconsistent with the role of grandparents as alloparents,\nthus supporting the proposition that humans are coopera-\ntive breeders. Indeed, we suspect that not even the great-\nest believer in the merits of grandparental investment\nwould predict that benefits hold invariably across all ages\nand ecologies. Finally, on a technical note, counting the\nnumber of negative, positive, or non-significant associ-\nations could be highly misleading, when the coarseness\nof the bins changes across time. For example, the period\nfrom 0\u201311 months, in which one may predict no effect,\nis divided into three bins in Beise (2005; see Table 1 in\nStrassmann & Kurapati), whereas the period from 12 to\n23 months, for which one may predict an effect, is col-\nlapsed into one bin only.\nNotwithstanding these issues, we applaud Strassmann\n& Kurapati\u2019s efforts, even if Sear and Mace\u2019s analysis is\nnot as rudimentary as this commentary suggests (see the\n\u201cother effects and notes\u201d column in Table 2A and 2B;\nResponse\/Coall & Hertwig: Grandparental investment\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:1 49\nSear & Mace 2008). We hope that their contribution will\nensure a constructive debate on the relative merits of\nthe grandmother and mother hypotheses.\nR8. Conclusion\nWe are convinced that to move forward, research on grand-\nparental investment and intergenerational transfers, scat-\ntered across disciplines, will need to embrace an ethos of\ninterdisciplinary research. Our target article aimed to take\nfirst steps toward a multidisciplinary framework. Generally,\nthe commentaries we received echo this need to travel\nacross disciplinary borders. After reading the thoughtful\nquestions and issues brought up by our commentators we\nare more than ever persuaded that a joint effort by research-\ners from psychology, sociology, anthropology, evolutionary\nbiology, and demography will reveal so much more about\nthe effects of grandparenting in the developed world than\ncan a single discipline on its own.\nReferences\n[Letters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d appearing before authors\u2019 initials refer to target article\nand response references, respectively.]\nAlbertini, M., Kohli, M. & Vogel, C.
