Introduction \n \nPumps are used in most of our domestic and industrial applications. Every pump \nmanufacturer supplies characteristic curves for their equipment illustrating pump \nperformance under given conditions. These curves demonstrate the inter-relationship \nbetween discharge capacities, pump head, power and operating efficiency. The ideal \noperating point for a pump is known as the best efficiency point (BEP). This is the point \nwhere pump capacity and head pressure combine to provide the maximum efficiency of \nthe pump. If the pump operates outside the BEP, not only will its efficiency be \ncompromised, but it will be subject to increased wear, reducing operational life. \n \nTypically the pump manufacturer will undertake performance and NPSH (Net Positive \nSuction Head) tests on supplied pumps, the significance of the latter is to determine the \n3% drop in head at which serious cavitations will occur. The NPSH can be expressed as \nthe difference between the suction head and the liquids vapour head. The concept of \nNPSH was developed for the purpose of comparing inlet condition of the system with the \ninlet requirement of the pump. Cavitation causes a loss of pump efficiency and \ndegradation of the mechanical integrity of the pump. It must be noted that cavitation \nstarts to develop before the 3% drop in head. It is generally accepted that the critical \npressure for inception of cavitation is not constant and varies with operation fluid \nphysical properties and the surface roughness of the hydraulic equipment. \n \n 3\nApplication of the high frequency Acoustic Emission (AE) technique in condition \nmonitoring of rotating machinery has been growing over recent years [1-9]. Typical \nfrequencies associated with AE activity range from 20 KHz to 1MHz. The most \ncommonly used method for identifying the presence of cavitation is based on \nobservations of the drop in head. Whilst other techniques such as vibration analysis and \nhydrophone observations for pump fault diagnosis are well established, the application of \nAE to this field is still in its infancy. In addition, there are a limited number of \npublications on the application of AE to pump health and cavitation monitoring. \n \nDerakhshan et al [10] investigated the cavitation bubble collapse as a source of acoustic \nemission and commented that the high amplitude pressure pulse associated with bubble \ncollapse generated AE. With the AE sensor was placed on the actual specimen \nexperiencing cavitation Derkhshan observed increasing AE r.m.s levels with increased \npressure of flow and cavitation.  However, with the AE sensor mounted on the tank wall \nthe reverse was observed, decreasing AE r.m.s levels with increasing pressure and \ncavitation. This was attributed to a visible bubble cloud that increased with pressure. It \nwas commented that this cloud attenuated the AE signature prior to reaching the \ntransducer on the wall casing. Neill et al [11,12] assessed the possibility of early \ncavitation detection with AE and also noted that the collapse of cavitation bubbles was an \nimpulsive event of the type that could generate AE. It was observed that when the pump \nwas under cavitation the AE operational background levels dropped in comparison to \nnon-cavitating conditions. In conclusion Neill stated that loss in NPSH before the 3% \n 4\ndrop-off criterion was detectable with AE and evidence of incipient cavitation was \ndetectable in the higher frequency band (0.5 to 1MHz).  \n \nThe papers reviewed above have clearly associated AE with the collapse of cavitation \nbubbles. The presence of cavitation has been shown to increase or decrease operational \nAE noise levels [10, 11, 12]. This paper presents a case study to ascertain the \napplicability of the AE technique for detecting incipient cavitation, and, to access the \nopportunities offered by the AE technique for determining the best efficiency point (BEP) \nof a pump.  \n \n2. Experimental setup  \n \nA series of performance and NPSH tests were undertaken on a two stage \u2018David Brown\u2019 \n60KW centrifugal pump (Model DB22) with a maximum capacity of 204m3\/h at an \nefficiency of 70.6%. These tests were undertaken using a closed loop arrangement with a \nvacuum facility in accordance with BS 9906. It must be noted that best endeavours were \nundertaken to reduce the time taken to reach the required flow rate during performance \nand NPSH tests.  \n \nAcoustic Emission sensors were located at a distance of 0.5 m from suction flange; at the \nsuction flange; on the pump casing in the vicinity of impeller suction eye; on the casing \nin the vicinity of the impeller discharge tip; 0.5m from discharge flange, see   figure 1.  \n 5\n3. Data acquisition systems \n \nThe AE sensors used for all of the experiments were broadband type sensors with a \nrelative flat response in the region between 100 KHz to 1MHz (Model: WD, \u2018Physical \nAcoustics Corporation\u2019). The output signal from the AE sensors was pre-amplified at \n40dB. Continuous AE r.m.s values were calculated in real time by the Analogue to \nDigital Converter (ADC). The sampling rate for acquisition was set at 100ms for all tests \nand the time constant for calculating the AE r.m.s was also set at 100 ms.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 60KW centrifugal pump which underwent perfomance and NPSH \ntests showing AE sensor locations  \n \n \n \n \n \n 6\n4. Experimental results and observations \n \n4.1 Performance test \n \nFigure 2 details the performance characteristics of the pump, highlighting the BEP at \n94.5m3\/hr. The performance test were undertaken twice to ensure repeatability. \nObservations of AE r.m.s activity during the performance test are displayed in figure 3. \nDuring the performance test, AE activity from the sensor located in the vicinity of \nimpeller on pump casing was found to have the largest magnitude, providing the best \nposition for correlating AE activity to pump performance. It was observed that the \nminimum AE r.m.s value was obtained for a flow rate of 94.5m3\/hr. At this flow rate the \nAE activity generated from the fluid flow within the pump and pipes was lowest in \ncomparison to other flow rates. Either side of this flow rate resulted in increasing AE \nr.m.s activity with increased flow rates. Based on these observations it was concluded \nthat the BEP must occur where there was minimal flow turbulence in the system, and \nhence minimum AE activity. The predicted efficiency point of 94.5m3\/hr was checked \nwith the manufacturer\u2019s performance test and was found to be accurate. Interestingly this \nis the first known correlation between AE activity and the BEP and agrees with \nobservations of McNulty [13], though McNulty\u2019s investigation was centred at \nfrequencies in the audible range; lower than the AE range. The advantage offered by the \nAE technique is the inherent rejection of typical mechanical and process operational \nbackground noise (less than 20 KHz). \n \n 7\n60 KW\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n110\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\nFlow rate (m3\/hr) for 60 KW pump\nH\nea\nd \n(m\n) f\nor\n 6\n0 \nK\nW\n P\num\np BEP\n \nFigure 2  Performance test result of the 60 KW centrifugal pump  \n0.5 m from suction flange\nImpeller eye position\n0.5 m from discharge \nflange\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\n02004006008001000120014001600\nTime (sec)\nA\nE \nin\n r\n.m\n.s\n (v\n)\n0 flow 57.2m3\/hr 94.5m3\/hr 113.6m3\/hr 177m3\/hr\nPredicted BEP\n \nFigure 3  AE r.m.s levels associated with the performance test  \n 8\n \n4.2  NPSH tests \nA total of three NPSH tests were undertaken at flow rates of 101, 141 and 180m3\/hr, see \nfigure 4.

Relatively constant levels \nfollowed until an NPSH of 5.8 m when a rapid decrease in AE r.m.s levels \nwas noted. With further reductions in NPSH, spikes in AE r.m.s signal \n 9\nresponse were observed as the 3% drop in head was reached. This \nphenomenon of spiky AE r.m.s levels associated with cavitation was also \nobserved by Neill [11]. Observations of AE levels from the suction and \ndischarge pipes mirrored this observation. \nii) At a flow rate of 141m3\/hr an increase of 43% in AE r.m.s was observed at \nNPSH value of 12.7m to 9.3m. A rapid decrease in level was noted at an \nNPSH of 9.3m. With further reductions in NPSH, spikes in AE r.m.s signal \nwere observed as with the test a flow rate of 101m3\/hr. Again, observations of \nAE levels from the suction and discharge pipes mirrored this observation. \niii) At a flow rate of 181m3\/hr an increase in AE r.m.s of 223% was observed at \nNPSH value of 11m to 7.3m. A gradual decrease in the AE levels followed to \nan NPSH of 1.7 m, where an increase in the r.m.s value was observed.    \n 10\n0.5m  from  suction  flange 0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0200400600800100012001400\nTime (sec)\nA\nE \nin\n r.\nm\n.s\n (v\n)\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\n110\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nNPSH (m)\nH\nea\nd \n(m\n)\nNPSH\n0.5m  from  discharge  flange\nImpeller eye position\n \nFigure 5 AE r.m.s levels at a flow rate of 101m3\/hr \n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\n0.035\n0.04\n01002003004005006007008009001000\nTime (sec)\nA\nE \nin\n r.\nm\n.s\n (v\n)\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n105\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nNPSH (m)\nH\nea\nd \n(m\n)\nNPSH curve\n0.5 m  from suction flange\n0.5 m from discharge \nfl\nImpeller eye\n \nFigure 6         AE r.m.s levels at a flow rate of 141m3\/hr \n 11\n \n0.5 m from suction flange\nimpeller eye position \n0.5 m from dicharge flange \n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0100200300400500600700800\nTime (sec)\nA\nE \nin\n r.\nm\n.s\n (v\n)\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nNPSH (m)\nH\nea\nd \n(m\n)\nNPSH\n \nFigure 7        AE r.m.s levels at a flow rate of 180m3\/hr \n \n6. Discussions \n \n6.1 Performance test  \n \nThe observations of AE activity during the performance test were very encouraging. The \nability to predict a systems BEP by observing variations in the AE r.m.s response offer \nprocess engineers a powerful tool for monitoring plant performance. Whilst further \nresearch is still required the opportunities offered by such a tool could be applied to \ndetermining system BEP irrespective of the type of medium (liquid, gases, semi-solids, \netc) in the system. The observations noted in this investigation correlate with hydrophone \n 12\nmeasurements undertaken by McNulty [13], where the minimum sound intensity \ncoincided with the pump BEP.  \n \n6.2 NPSH test  \n \nIt is essential to understand the cavitation sequence if it is to be correlated to observed AE \nactivity. Once the suction pressure starts to decrease, vortexes start to occur at the \nimpeller blade tips. With further reduction in pressure these vortexes take the form of \ntravelling bubbles in the liquid. These bubbles are initially created in lower pressure area \non the suction surface of the blades. Eventually the bubbles move to higher-pressure \nareas where they collapse. With even further reduction in the suction pressure, the \nbubbles combine into larger cavities. These cavities are usually formed on the impeller \nblade suction surface.  \n \nFor all NPSH tests an increase in AE r.m.s levels was noted as values of NPSH started to \ndecrease. A maximum level of AE r.m.s was reached after which further reductions in \nNPSH resulted in a decrease in AE r.m.s levels. This was also observed on the sensors \nlocated on the suction and discharge flanges. It is postulated that at the start of the NPSH \ntest the increase in AE r.m.s levels was attributed to the onset of cavitation. The drop in \nAE r.m.s with decreasing NPSH values was attributed to the attenuation caused by \nbubble clouds. Following the creation of bubbles, and the eventual formation of the \nbubble cloud, the AE r.m.s levels were expected to drop. The loss in AE strength due to \n 13\nthe presence of cavitation and the bubble cloud was noted by Neill [11, 12] and \nDerakhshan [10] respectively.   \n \n6. Conclusions \n \nThe results from acoustic emission analysis have shown a clear relationship between AE \nactivity measured from the pump casing, suction and discharge pipes, and incipient \ncavitation. At a relatively high NPSH value, when incipient cavitation is known to occur, \nan increase in AE r.m.s levels was observed. However, as cavitation developed a \nreduction in AE r.m.s levels due to attenuation was noted. This would suggest that the AE \ntechnique is more suited to detecting incipient, and not developed, cavitation. AE was \nalso found to have enormous potential in determining the BEP of a pump and\/or process \nemploying pumps though further research on this observation is required.  \n \n7. References \n \n1.
