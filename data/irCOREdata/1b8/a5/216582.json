However, this is not the case. I will critically evalu-\nate the existing answers and argue that they do not fit the bill. Then\nI will approach this question by showing that chaos can be defined\nvia mixing, which has never before been explicitly argued for. Based\non this insight, I will propose that the sought-after new implication of\nchaos for unpredictability is the following: for predicting any event all\nsufficiently past events are approximately probabilistically irrelevant.\n1\nContents\n1 Introduction 3\n2 Dynamical Systems and Unpredictability 4\n2.1 Dynamical Systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n2.2 Natural Invariant Measures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7\n2.3 Unpredictability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n3 Chaos 10\n3.1 Defining Chaos . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n3.2 Defining Chaos via Mixing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n4 Criticism of Answers in the Literature 17\n4.1 New: Asymptotically Unpredictable? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\n4.2 New: Unpredictable Due to Rapid or Exponential Divergence\nof Solutions? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\n4.3 New: Macro-predictable & Micro-unpredictable? . . . . . . . . 19\n5 A General New Implication of Chaos for Unpredictability 21\n5.1 Approximate Probabilistic Irrelevance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n5.2 New: Sufficiently Past Events Approximately Probabilistically\nIrrelevant for Predictions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n6 Conclusion 25\nReferences 26\n2\n1 Introduction\nIn the past decades much ado has been made about chaos research, which has\nbeen hailed as having led to revolutionary scientific insights. Since the begin-\nnings of systematically investigating chaos until today, the unpredictability\nof chaotic systems has been at the centre of interest.\nThere is widespread belief in the philosophy, mathematics and physics\ncommunities (and it has been claimed in various articles and books) that\nthere is a new implication of chaos for unpredictability, meaning that chaotic\nsystems are unpredictable in a way other deterministic systems are not. More\nspecifically, what is usually believed is that there is at least one new impli-\ncation of chaos for unpredictability that holds true in all chaotic systems.\nThe physicist James Lighthill, commenting on the impact of chaos on\nunpredictability, expresses this point as follows:\nWe are all deeply conscious today that the enthusiasm of our forebears\nfor the marvellous achievements of Newtonian mechanics led them to\nmake generalizations in this area of predictability which, indeed, we\nmay have generally tended to believe before 1960, but which we now\nrecognize were false (Lighthill [1986], p. 38).\nThese features connected with predictability that I shall describe from\nnow on, then, are characteristic of absolutely all chaotic systems (Ibid.,\np. 42).\nSimilarly, Weingartner ([1996], p. 50) says that \u2018the new discovery now was\nthat [...] a dynamical system obeying Newton\u2019s laws [...] can become chaotic\nin its behaviour and practically unpredictable\u2019.\nThus the question \u2018What are the new implications of chaos for unpre-\ndictability?\u2019 appears natural, and one might well suppose that it has already\nbeen satisfactorily answered. However, this is not the case. On the contrary,\nthere is a lot of confusion about what exactly the new implications of chaos\nfor unpredictability are. Several answers have been proposed, but, as we will\nsee, none of them fit the bill.\nFundamental questions about the limits of predictability have always been\nof concern to philosophy. So the widespread belief and the various flawed\naccounts about the new implications of chaos for unpredictability demand\nclarification. The aim of this paper is to critically discuss existing accounts\nand to propose a novel and more satisfactory answer.\nMy answer will be based on two insights. First, I will show that chaos can\nbe defined in terms of mixing. Although mixing is occasionally mentioned in\nconnection with chaos, to the best of my knowledge, so far no one has explic-\nitly argued that chaos can be thus defined. Second, I will argue that mixing\n3\nhas a natural interpretation as a particular form of approximate probabilistic\nirrelevance which is a form of unpredictability. On this basis I will propose a\ngeneral novel answer: a new implication of chaos for unpredictability is that\nfor predicting any event at any level of precision, all sufficiently past events\nare approximately probabilistically irrelevant.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 will provide the back-\nground of our discussion. I will introduce dynamical systems, and I will\ndiscuss the concepts of unpredictability relevant for this paper. Section 3\nwill be about chaos. Here I will show that chaos can be defined in terms\nof mixing. After that, in section 4 I will examine the existing answers to\nthe question of the new implications of chaos for unpredictability, which I\ndismiss as mistaken. In section 5 I propose a general answer that does not\nsuffer from the shortcomings of the other accounts.\n2 Dynamical Systems and Unpredictability\n2.1 Dynamical Systems\nChaos is discussed in dynamical systems theory. A dynamical system is a\nmathematical model consisting of a phase space X, the set of all possible\nstates of the system, and evolution equations that describe how solutions\nevolve in phase space. Dynamical systems often model natural systems (e.g.\nin the sciences).\nThere are discrete dynamical systems and continuous dynamical systems.\nDiscrete dynamical systems are systems in which the time increases in dis-\ncrete steps. Formally, they consist of a set X as phase space and a map\nT : X \u2192 X as evolution equation; the dynamics of the system is given by\nxn+1 = T (xn), x0 \u2208 X, n \u2208 N0. The solution through x is the sequence\n(T n(x))n\u22650, which is also referred to as the iterates of x. If T is invertible\n(noninvertible), I speak of an invertible (noninvertible) discrete dynamical\nsystem, respectively. Continuous dynamical systems involve a continuous\ntime parameter. They typically arise from differential equations. By defini-\ntion, all dynamical systems and thus chaotic systems are deterministic.1\nFor simplicity I will often confine my attention to discrete dynamical\nsystems. I can do this without loss of generality because all definitions of\nchaos I will be using can be directly carried over to continuous dynamical\nsystems. Alternatively, a continuous dynamical system can be regarded as\n1According to the conventional definition of Montague ([1962]) and Earman ([1971]), a\ndynamical system is deterministic if and only if any two solutions that agree at one time\nagree at all future times.\n4\nchaotic if and only if there is a suitable Poincare\u00b4 section such that the discrete\ndynamical system defined by the Poincare\u00b4 map is chaotic (e.g. Smith [1998],\npp. 92\u20133). Hence everything I will say about the new implications of chaos\nfor unpredictability equally applies to continuous dynamical systems.\nDynamical systems divide into two groups: volume-preserving systems,\namong them Hamiltonian systems, and dissipative systems. A volume-preser-\nving system is defined as a system in which the phase-space volume is pre-\nserved under time evolution, i.e. the volume (formally the Lebesgue measure)\nof any region of phase space remains the same as this region is evolved ac-\ncording to the evolution equations (Smith [1998], p. 16). Dissipative systems\nare systems which are not volume-preserving.\nThere are two types of dynamical systems relevant for our discussion.\nFirst, if for a discrete system there is a metric d, where d measures the dis-\ntance between points in phase space, (X, d, T ) is called a \u2018topological dynam-\nical system\u2019. It is generally assumed in the literature (e.g. Devaney [1986],\np. 51), that topological systems provide a possible framework for character-\nising chaos. This makes intuitive sense because it is often imagined that in\ncase of chaotic behaviour there is some way of measuring the distance be-\ntween points in the phase space X and thus that there is a metric defined on\nX. Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, there is always a natural metric\nfor paradigmatic chaotic systems. Often the phase space is simply a subset\nof Rn, n \u2265 1, and the metric is the standard Euclidean metric.\nThe second type of dynamical system is a measure-theoretic dynamical\nsystem. It is a quadruple (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) consisting of a phase space X, a \u03c3-\nalgebra \u03a3 on X, a measure \u00b5 with \u00b5(X) = 1 and a surjective measurable\nmap T : X \u2192 X. If a property holds for all points in a subset X\u00af of X for\nwhich \u00b5(X\u00af) = 1, it is said that it holds for almost all points.\nImportant for us is what is called a \u2018measure-preserving dynamical sys-\ntem\u2019. It is a measure-theoretic system where for all A \u2208 \u03a3\n\u00b5(T\u22121(A)) = \u00b5(A), (1)\nwhere T\u22121(A) = {x \u2208 X : T (x) \u2208 A} (cf. Cornfeld et al. [1982], pp. 3\u20135).\nCondition (1) says that the measure \u00b5 is invariant under the dynamics of the\nsystem. Although there exist evolution equations that do not have invariant\nmeasures, for very wide classes of systems invariant measures can be proven\nto exist. For instance, if T is a continuous map on a compact phase space\nendowed with a metric, there exists at least one invariant measure (Man\u02dce\u00b4\n[1983], p. 52).2\n2Descriptions of a dynamical system via metric spaces and measures are usually related\n5\nAs it is sometimes claimed (e.g. Eckmann and Ruelle [1985]), measure-\npreserving systems provide a possible framework for characterising chaos.\nFor volume-preserving systems the natural invariant measure is typically the\nLebesgue measure or a normalized Lebesgue measure, e.g. the microcanonical\nmeasure of classical statistical mechanics. For dissipative systems, to the best\nof my knowledge, all systems that have ever been identified as chaotic have\nor are supposed to have a natural invariant measure if one considers the\nfollowing.\nMany chaotic systems have attractors. For a topological system (Y, d, T )\nthe set \u039b \u2282 Y is an attractor if and only if (i) T (\u039b) = \u039b; (ii) there is a\nneighbourhood U \u2283 \u039b such that all solutions are attracted by \u039b, i.e. for all\ny in U limn\u2192\u221e inf{d(T n(y), x) |x \u2208 \u039b} = 0; and (iii) no proper subset of \u039b\nsatisfies (i) and (ii). Liouville\u2019s theorem implies that only dissipative systems\ncan have attractors (Schuster and Just [2005], p. 162).3 As we will see in\nthe next section, for chaotic systems the evolution of any bundle of initial\nconditions eventually enters every region in phase space. This is impossible\nfor the motion approaching an attractor since the attracted solutions never\nreturn to where they originated. Hence chaotic behaviour can only occur on\n\u039b. The chaotic motion is described by a system with phase space \u039b, and the\ninvariant measure is only defined on \u039b. Generally, an attractor on which the\nmotion is chaotic is called a \u2018strange attractor \u2019.\nOf course, in practice one is often concerned with solutions approaching\na strange attractor. Yet after a sufficiently long duration either the solutions\nenter the attractor or come arbitrarily near to the attractor. In the latter\ncase since the dynamics is typically continuous, when the solutions are suf-\nficiently near to the attractor, they essentially behave like the solutions on\nthe attractor. And in applications such solutions which are sufficiently near\nto a strange attractor are considered to be chaotic for practical purposes. In\nparticular, in the latter case the unpredictability of solutions very near to\nthe attractor is practically indistinguishable from the one on the attractor.\nConsequently, for characterising the unpredictability of motion dominated\nby strange attractors, it is widely acknowledged that it suffices to consider\nthe dynamics on attractors, where natural invariant measures can be defined.\nin the following way: the \u03c3-algebra \u03a3 of a measure-theoretic system is, or at least includes,\nthe Borel \u03c3-algebra of the metric space (X, d) of the topological system. The Borel \u03c3-\nalgebra of (X, d) is the \u03c3-algebra generated by all open sets of X (cf. Man\u02dce\u00b4 [1983], pp. 2\u20133).\nIntuitively, it is the \u03c3-algebra which arises from the metric space (X, d).\n3Some other definitions of \u2018attractor\u2019 allow that volume-preserving systems can have\nattractors; yet these definitions are not standard in our context.\n6\n2.2 Natural Invariant Measures\nWhat are natural invariant measures, in particular for dissipative systems?\nFrom an observational viewpoint it is natural to demand that the long-run\ntime-averages of almost all solutions approximate the measure. Such mea-\nsures are called \u2018physical measures\u2019. Let us look at them in more detail\n(cf. Eckmann and Ruelle [1985], p. 626 and pp. 639\u201340).\nFor measure-preserving systems (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) with \u03bb(X) > 0, where \u03bb\nis the Lebesgue measure, the following method identifies physical measures.\n(M1) (i) Take any A \u2286 X. (ii) Take an initial condition x \u2208 X. (iii) Consider\nLA(x), the long-run average of the fraction of iterates of x which are in A.\n(iv) Consider GA = {x \u2208 X |LA(x) = \u00b5(A)}. Then \u00b5 is a physical measure if\nand only if for any A \u2208 \u03a3 Lebesgue-almost all initial conditions approximate\nthe measure of A, i.e. \u03bb(GA) = \u03bb(X). If such a measure exists, it is unique.\nWhat are physical measures for strange attractors? I will be concerned\nwith two kinds of strange attractors: first, the case where all solutions even-\ntually enter an attractor \u039b with \u03bb(\u039b) > 0. Clearly, here method (M1) can\nbe applied for X = \u039b. Second, it can be that the solutions approach but\nnever enter an attractor \u039b with \u03bb(\u039b) = 0 but \u03bb(U) > 0, where U is the\nneighbourhood of \u039b. Here the method has to be slightly modified. (M2): (i)\nTake any region A \u2286 \u039b. (ii) Take an initial condition x \u2208 U . (iii) Consider\nL\u00afA(x), the long-run average of the fraction of iterates of x which are close\nto A. (iv) Consider G\u00afA = {x \u2208 U | L\u00afA(x) = \u00b5(A)}. Then \u00b5 is a physical\nmeasure if and only if for all A \u2208 \u03a3 it holds that \u03bb(G\u00afA) = \u03bb(U). If such a\nmeasure exists, it is unique.\nAs we will see in the next section, chaotic systems are ergodic. A measure-\npreserving system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is ergodic if and only if for all A \u2208 \u03a3 with\n\u00b5(A) > 0:\n\u00b5(\u222an\u22650T\u2212n(A)) = 1. (2)\nNow for ergodic volume-preserving systems the Lebesgue-measure is the\nphysical measure. As we will see in the next section, typically for systems\nproven to be chaotic physical measures can be proven to exist (Lyubich [2002];\nYoung [2002]). For system only conjectured to be chaotic numerical evidence\ngenerally favours the existence of physical measures (Young [1997]).\nFor an example consider the logistic map T (x) : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], T (x) =\n\u03b1x(1\u2212 x) with \u03b1 \u2248 3.6785. Here the solutions enter an attractor of positive\nLebesgue measure. Now we choose an initial condition on the attractor and\ndraw a histogram of the fraction of iterates of x (up to an iterate T n(x), n \u2265 1)\nwhich are in a particular part on the attractor. Then, for Lebesgue-almost\nall initial conditions we chose on the attractor, we obtain what is illustrated\nin Figure 1: as n goes to infinity and the histogram becomes finer, the\n7\nFigure 1: (a) histogram and (b) natural measure of the logistic map for \u03b1 \u2248 3.6785\nhistograms approximate a particular measure on the attractor. Hence this\nmeasure is physical according to method (M1) (cf. Jacobson [1981]).\nFor another example consider the Lorenz equations\ndx(t)\ndt\n= \u03c3(y(t)\u2212 x(t))\ndy(t)\ndt\n= rx(t)\u2212 y(t)\u2212 x(t)z(t) (3)\ndz(t)\ndt\n= x(t)y(t)\u2212 bz(t),\nfor the parameter values \u03c3 = 10, r = 28 and b = 8\/3, which Lorenz ([1963])\nconsidered. Here it is proven that there is a strange attractor of Lebesgue\nmeasure zero such that all solutions originating in the neighbourhood of\nthe attractor, which is of positive Lebesgue measure, approach but never\nenter the system. Figure 2 shows a numerical solution of these equations;\none can vaguely discern the shape of the attractor, known as the Lorenz\nattractor, because the solution spirals toward it. According to the method\n(M2), the physical measure is the one for which for Lebesgue-almost-all initial\nconditions in the neighbourhood of the attractor the long-run time-average\na solution is close to a set A on the attractor approximates the measure of\nA (cf. Luzzatto et al. [2005]).4\n4There are also other natural measures. For instance, \u03bd is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to \u00b5, where \u03bd and \u00b5 are measures on a measurable space (X,\u03a3), if and only if for\nall A \u2208 \u03a3 with \u00b5(A) = 0 also \u03bd(A) = 0. Absolute continuity with respect to the Lebesgue\nmeasure can be justified (Malament and Zabell [1980]; van Lith [2001], p. 590). Hence\nif there is a unique ergodic invariant measure absolutely continuous with respect to the\n8\nFigure 2: Numerical solution of the Lorenz equations for \u03c3 = 10, r = 28, b = 8\/3\nInvariant measures are commonly interpreted as probability densities.\nThis deep and controversial issue has, of course, been discussed in statistical\nmechanics but is not the main focus of this paper. I only mention two\ninterpretations that naturally suggest interpreting measures as probability\nand relate to our discussion. According to the time-average interpretation,\nthe measure of a set A is the long-run time-average a solution spends in\nA. According to the ensemble interpretation, the measure of a set A at\nt corresponds to the fraction of solutions starting from some set of initial\nconditions that are in A at time t (Berkovitz et al. [2006], p. 675).\n2.3 Unpredictability\nThere are different kinds of unpredictability in dynamical systems. I will\nonly introduce two concepts needed for the discussion of our main question.\nAccording to the first concept of unpredictability, a system is unpre-\ndictable when any bundle of initial conditions spreads out more than a specific\ndiameter representing the prediction accuracy of interest (usually of larger di-\nameter than the one of the bundle of initial conditions). When this happens,\nthe system is unpredictable in the sense that the prediction based on any bun-\ndle of initial conditions is so imprecise that it is impossible to determine the\nLebesgue measure, it is a natural one. For ergodic volume-preserving systems the Lebesgue\nmeasure is such a unique measure. For many systems, e.g. wide classes of one-dimensional\nmaps and, as we will see in the next section, many paradigmatic dissipative chaotic systems\nincluding strange attractors, there is a unique ergodic measure absolutely continuous with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure (Lyubich [2002]). For instance, for the logistic map with\n\u00b5 \u2248 3.6785 the measure of Figure 1(b) is such a unique measure (Jacobson [1981]).\n9\noutcome of the system with the desired prediction accuracy.5 A well-known\nexample is a system in which, due to exponential divergence of solutions, any\nbundle of initial conditions of at least a specific diameter spreads out over\nshort time periods more than a diameter of interest.\nThe second concept of unpredictability is probabilistic. It says that for\npractical purposes any bundle of initial conditions is irrelevant, i.e. makes\nit neither more nor less likely that the state is in a region of phase space of\ninterest. According to this concept, it is not only impossible to predict with\ncertainty in which region the system will be, but in addition, for practical\npurposes knowledge of the possible initial conditions neither heightens, nor\nlowers, the probability that the state is in a given region of phase space. An\nexample is that knowledge of any bundle of sufficiently past initial conditions\nis practically irrelevant for predicting that the state of the system is in a re-\ngion of phase space. Eagle ([2005], p. 775) defines randomness as a strong\nform of unpredictability: an event is random if and only if the probability of\nthe event conditional on evidence equals the prior probability of the event.\nThis idea relativised to practical purposes is at the heart of our second con-\ncept. Consequently, this second concept can also be regarded as a form of\nrandomness.\nClearly, the first and second concepts of unpredictability are different and\ncannot be expressed in terms of each other since the notions of \u2018diameter\u2019\nand \u2018probability\u2019 are not expressible in terms of each other.\n3 Chaos\n3.1 Defining Chaos\nI base the discussion of defining chaos on the following assumption, which is\nwidely accepted in the literature (e.g. Brin and Stuck [2002], p. 23; Devaney\n[1986], p. 51). A formal definition of chaos is adequate if and only if\n(i) it captures the main pretheoretic intuitions about chaos, and\n(ii) it is extensionally correct (i.e. correctly classifies essentially all systems\nwhich, according to the pretheoretic understanding, are uncontrover-\nsially chaotic or nonchaotic).\nLet us first direct our attention to (i). Roughly, chaotic systems are deter-\nministic systems showing irregular, or even random, behaviour and sensitive\ndependence to initial conditions (SDIC). SDIC means that small errors in\ninitial conditions lead to totally different solutions.\n5Schurz ([1996], pp. 133\u20139) discusses several variants of this form of unpredictability.\n10\nFigure 3: behaviour of the logistic map for \u03b1 = 4\nThe logistic map T : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1], T (x) = \u03b1x(1 \u2212 x) for \u03b1 = 4 is\na paradigmatic chaotic system. Figure 3 shows the first six iterates of a\nsmall bundle of initial conditions I, and suggests that any bundle blows\nup substantially. Thus the system appears to exhibit SDIC. This figure also\nsuggests that any bundle blows up until it covers the whole phase space. Thus\nthe motion appears not only to exhibit SDIC but also irregular behaviour\nin the following sense: any bundle of initial conditions eventually intersects\nwith any other region in phase space, a property called denseness. It is widely\nagreed that SDIC and denseness are necessary conditions for chaos (Niellsen\n[1999], pp. 14\u20135; Peitgen et al. [1992], pp. 509\u201321; Smith [1998], pp. 167\u20139).\nThis motivates the following criterion: a definition applying to dynamical\nsystems captures the main pretheoretic intuitions about chaos if and only if\nit implies SDIC and denseness.\nLet us now discuss (ii), the requirement of extensional correctness. Imag-\nine we are concerned with a pretheoretic property P. Further, assume that\nwe are faced with a class of objects some of which uncontroversially have\nproperty P, others uncontroversially fail to have property P, and yet others\nare borderline cases or controversial in some sense. The task is to find an\nunambiguous definition of P. Then it is natural to say that an unambiguous\ndefinition of the property P is extensionally correct if and only if it classifies\nall objects correctly which uncontroversially have or do not have property P.\nFor the borderline objects it is unimportant how they are classified, and we\ndefer to the definition.\nBeing chaotic is such a property because the pretheoretic idea of chaos is\nsomewhat vague. Among the dynamical systems whose behaviour is mathe-\nmatically well understood, there is a broad class of uncontroversially chaotic\n11\nsystems and a broad class of uncontroversially nonchaotic systems. More-\nover, there are a few borderline cases, for example the system discussed by\nMartinelli et al. ([1998], p. 199), where it is not clear whether they are chaotic\n(Brin and Stuck [2002], p. 23; Robinson [1995], pp. 81\u20135; Zaslavsky [2005],\npp. 53\u20134). Consequently, I say that a formal definition of chaos is extension-\nally correct if and only if it correctly classifies essentially all mathematically\nwell understood uncontroversially chaotic and nonchaotic behaviour.\nSeveral definitions of chaos have been proposed (Lichtenberg and Lieber-\nman [1992], pp. 302\u20139; Robinson [1995], pp. 81\u20136). While these definitions\nare very similar, they are all inequivalent. For want of space I cannot discuss\nall these definitions here and instead focus on a definition of chaos in terms\nof mixing, which will be crucial later on.\n3.2 Defining Chaos via Mixing\nIntuitively speaking, the fact that a system is mixing means that any bundle\nof solutions spreads out in phase space like a drop of ink in a glass of water.\nA measure-preserving dynamical system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is mixing if and only if\nfor all A,B \u2208 \u03a3:\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u00b5(T\u2212n(B) \u2229 A) = \u00b5(B)\u00b5(A). (4)\nMixing is occasionally mentioned in connection with chaos, usually only in\nthe context of volume-preserving systems (e.g. Lichtenberg and Liebermann\n[1992], pp. 302\u20133; Schuster and Just [2005], p. 177). Yet, to the best of my\nknowledge, so far no one has explicitly argued that chaos can thus be defined.\nI will argue for this and propose that mixing is chaos : a system is chaotic if\nand only if it is mixing on the relevant subset of X. More needs to be said\nabout what qualifies as the relevant subset later on.\nSince mixing was introduced before the 1960s, the beginning of the sys-\ntematic investigation of chaos, it might seem puzzling that chaos can be ade-\nquately defined via mixing. However, many formal definitions and measures\nof chaos were invented before the 1960s (Dahan-Dalmedico [2004], p. 70),\nbut rather few systems were known to which these notions apply. Novel\nfrom the 1960s onwards was that many different highly interesting systems,\nsurprisingly also very simple systems, were found to which these concepts\napply.\nLet us first discuss whether mixing captures the pretheoretic intuitions.\nMixing implies denseness: mixing systems are ergodic (Cornfeld et al. [1982],\np. 25). By looking at equation (2) we see that from this follows that any\nregion, naturally interpreted as a set of positive measure, eventually visits\nevery region in phase space.\n12\nMixing also implies SDIC. This can be seen as follows. Mixing im-\nplies that any bundle of initial conditions spreads out uniformly over the\nphase space. Therefore, any bundle eventually spreads out considerably,\nthus exhibiting SDIC. Formally, assume a mixing measure-preserving system\n(X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is given where a metric d is defined on X and \u03a3 contains every\nopen set of X. Further, assume that every open set has positive measure.6\nConsider two open sets O1 and O2 with 0 < \u03b5 := infx\u2208O1,y\u2208O2{d(x, y)}. Mix-\ning implies that for any open set O there is a n \u2265 0 such that T n(O)\u2229O1 6= \u2205\nand T n(O) \u2229 O2 6= \u2205. But this means that \u03b5 \u2264 supx,y\u2208Tn(O){d(x, y)}. Hence\nthe following condition holds, which in definitions like Devaney chaos is taken\nto be the SDIC implied by chaotic behaviour (Devaney [1986], p. 51):\nThere is a \u03b5 > 0 such that for all x \u2208 X and for all \u03b4 > 0 (5)\nthere is a y \u2208 X and a n \u2208 N0 with d(x, y) < \u03b4 and d(T n(x), T n(y)) \u2265 \u03b5.\nAs SDIC is often linked to positive Liapunov exponents, let us now turn\nto a discussion of this issue. For a continuously differentiable T on an open\nX \u2286 R the Liapunov-exponent of x \u2208 X is\n\u03bb(x) := lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n1\nn\nn\u22121\u2211\ni=0\nlog(|T \u2032(T i(x))|), (6)\nwhere T \u2032 is the derivative of T (for a general definition see Man\u02dce\u00b4 [1983],\np. 263). For ergodic systems the Liapunov-exponent exists and is equal for\nall points except for a set of measure zero (Robinson [1995], p. 86). Hence one\ncan speak of the Liapunov-exponent of a system. Accordingly, one definition\nof chaos that has been suggested is that the system is ergodic and has a\npositive Liapunov-exponent.\nFrom a positive Liapunov exponent it is commonly concluded that the\nSDIC shown by chaos consists of the exponential spreading of inaccuracies\nover finite time periods (e.g. Lighthill [1986], p. 46; Ott [2002], p. 140; Smith\n[1998], p. 15).7 However, this is mistaken. Positive Liapunov exponents im-\nply that for almost all points x in phase space the average over all i \u2265 0 of\nlog(|T \u2032(T i(x))|)\u2014the exponential growth rate of an inaccuracy at the point\nT i(x)\u2014is positive. Here the average is taken for the solution starting from\nx over an infinite time period. But positive on average exponential growth\nrates over an infinite time period do not imply that nearby solutions di-\nverge exponentially or rapidly over finite time periods. The growth rate over\n6This is standardly assumed and, to the best of my knowledge, applies to all paradig-\nmatic chaos systems.\n7With the qualification that the time periods have to be small enough such that the\ninaccuracy does not eventually saturate at the diameter of the system.\n13\nfinite time periods can be anything; inaccuracies can even shrink (Smith\net al. [1999], pp. 2861\u20132).8 Furthermore, it is not true that inaccuracies\nof chaotic systems spread exponentially or rapidly over finite time periods:\nfor paradigmatic chaotic systems like the Lorenz attractor there are regions\nwhere inaccuracies even shrink over finite time periods, and numerical evi-\ndence suggests such regions for many chaotic systems (Smith et al. [1999],\np. 2881; Zaslavsky [2005], p. 315; Ziehmann et al. [2000], pp. 10\u20131).\nMixing systems need not have positive Liapunov exponents, and thus in-\naccuracies need not grow exponentially on average as time goes to infinity.\nIs this a problem for mixing as a definition of chaos? No. First, there is no\nagreement in the literature whether chaos should show this on average expo-\nnential growth. Some definitions do indeed demand it, others like Devaney\nchaos do not. Second, the arguments for requiring positive Liapunov expo-\nnents are not convincing. The standard rationale is that the SDIC shown\nby chaotic system has to be exponential divergence of nearby solutions over\nfinite time periods. But as shown above, this is not implied by a positive\nLiapunov exponent and also does not generally hold for chaotic systems.\nAnother possible argument is that for chaotic behaviour inaccuracies should\nspread out rapidly. Yet the rate of divergence of mixing systems not having\npositive Liapunov exponents can be much faster for arbitrary long time pe-\nriods than for systems with positive Liapunov exponents; thus it is not clear\nwhy positive Liapunov exponents should be required (Berkovitz et al. [2006],\np. 689; Wiggins [1990], p. 615). To conclude, mixing captures the pretheo-\nretic intuitions about chaos. It remains to show that mixing is extensionally\ncorrect.\nTo do this, I have to consider the main classes of uncontroversially chaotic\nand nonchaotic behaviour.9 I start with uncontroversially chaotic behaviour\nand first discuss volume-preserving systems. There are (i) Hamiltonian sys-\ntem which are chaotic on the whole hypersurface of constant energy. Three\ntypes of systems are mainly discussed here: first, chaotic billiards, which\nare mixing (Chernov and Markarian [2006]; Ott [2002], p. 296); second,\nhard sphere systems, which are either proven or conjectured to be mixing\n(Berkovitz et al. [2006], pp. 679\u201380); third, geodesic flows of space with\nnegative Gaussian curvature, which are mixing (Schuster and Just [2005],\np. 181).\n8Moreover, Liapunov exponents only measure the average growth rate of an infinites-\nimal inaccuracy around x, which is defined as the growth rate of a small ball of radius\n\u03b5 > 0 with centre x as \u03b5\u2192 0; yet in practice the uncertainty is finite and may not behave\nlike the infinitesimal one (cf. Bishop [unpublished], p. 8).\n9Obviously, I cannot discuss every single system regarded as clearly chaotic or non-\nchaotic. Yet our discussion covers all main examples.\n14\nAnother class are (ii) Hamiltonian systems to which the KAM-theorem\napplies, e.g. the He\u00b4non-Heiles system or the standard map. This class also\nincludes simplified versions of Poincare\u00b4 maps of systems to which the KAM-\ntheorem applies. The KAM-theorem describes what happens when integrable\nsystems are perturbed by a nonintegrable perturbation. It says that tori with\nsufficiently irrational winding number survive the perturbation. Between\nthe stable motion on surviving tori there appear to be regions of random\nmotion. As the perturbation increases, these regions become larger and often\neventually cover nearly the entire hypersurface of constant energy.\nFor these systems the phase space is separated into regions, each of which\nhas its own dynamics: in some of them the motion appears random and in\nothers it is stable. Because of this separation into regions, random behaviour\ncan only be found in a region. Consequently, as is widely acknowledged,\nproper chaotic motion can only occur on a region (Ott [2002], pp. 267\u201395;\nSchuster and Just [2005], pp. 165\u201374). Thus I have to show that the math-\nematically well-understood random motion in a region is mixing. Yet the\nconjectured chaotic motion of KAM-type systems is understood only poorly\n(Zaslavsky [2005], p. 139). It has only been proven that there is chaotic\nbehaviour near hyperbolic fixed points, where the motion is indeed mixing\n(Moser [1973], chapter 3). Apart from this, some numerical evidence suggests\nthat the motion conjectured to be chaotic is mixing (e.g. Chirikov [1979]).\nThus Lichtenberg and Liebermann ([1992], p. 303) comment that we \u2018expect\nthat the stochastic orbits that we have encountered in previous sections are\nmixing over the bounded portion of phase space for which they exist\u2019.\nI should mention that numerical experiments suggest that for a few KAM-\ntype maps there are sets on which the motion seems somewhat random,\nbut these sets consist of n \u2265 2 component areas, each of which is mapped\nsuccessively on to another, returning to itself after n iterations. There is no\nagreement whether such motion, which cannot be mixing, should be called\n\u2018chaotic\u2019 (e.g. Belot and Earman [1997], p. 154, vs. Ott [2002], p. 300). If it\nis, chaos can still be defined via mixing: one can say that a system is chaotic\nif and only if it is ergodic and its phase space is decomposable into n \u2265 1 sets\nwith disjoint interior such that the n-th iterate is mixing on each of these sets.\nI call this the \u2018broad definition of chaos via mixing\u2019. Numerical experiments\nsuggest that the behaviour mentioned above may be chaotic according to this\ndefinition (Ott [2002], p. 303).\nNext in line are (iii) chaotic volume-preserving non-Hamiltonian systems.\nHere the main examples discussed are discrete. First, the baker\u2019s map and\nvolume-preserving Anosov diffeomorphisms like the cat map, which are mix-\ning (Arnold and Avez [1968], p. 75; Lichtenberg and Liebermann [1992],\np. 303). Second, paradigmatic chaotic systems are expanding piecewise maps\n15\nlike the tent map or the sawtooth map, which are mixing too (Bowen [1977]).\nI now turn to dissipative systems and first discuss strange attractors. One\nclass are (iv) strange attractors where the attracted solutions never enter the\nattractor. Three main groups are treated here: first, for Smale\u2019s Solenoid,\nand generalised Solenoid systems, there is a measure on which the motion is\nmixing (Mayer and Roepstorff [1983]). Second, for the system investigated\nby Lorenz ([1963]) and the Lorenz model, and generalised versions thereof,\nthere is a physical measure on which the motion is mixing (Luzzatto et\nal. [2005]). Third, for generalised He\u00b4non systems like the He\u00b4non map there\nexists a physical measure such that the motion on the attractor is mixing\n(Benedicks and Young [1993]).\nAlso important is the (v) visible chaotic behaviour of generalised logistic\nsystems like the logistic map. For these discrete systems for most parameter\nvalues the solutions enter an attractor with a physical measure on which\nthe motion is either mixing or chaotic according to the broad definition via\nmixing. But for a few parameter values there is chaotic behaviour on the\nentire interval, e.g. for the logistic map with parameter 4; in these cases\nthere is also a physical measure on which the motion is mixing (Jacobsen\n[1981]; Lyubich [2002]).10\nFinally, another class is (vi) repelling chaotic behaviour on Cantor sets.\nTwo main kinds of discrete systems are discussed here: first, geometric\nhorseshoe-systems like Smale\u2019s horseshoe, which are mixing (Robinson [1995],\npp. 249\u201374). The second example is chaotic motion on Cantor sets for the\nlogistic map with parameter greater than 4, which is also mixing (Robinson\n[1995], p. 33).11\nLet us now turn to uncontroversially nonchaotic motion. I again start\nwith volume-preserving systems. A paradigmatic class are (i) integrable\nHamiltonian systems, where there is periodic or quasi-periodic motion on\ntori, which is not mixing (Arnold and Avez [1968], pp. 210\u2013214).\nAnother class is the (ii) motion on clearly nonchaotic regions of KAM-\ntype systems. Again, this class also includes simplified versions of Poincare\u00b4\nmaps of KAM-type systems. As already discussed, for KAM-type systems\nthe phase space is separated into regions, and on some regions the motion\nis stable. Thus I have to show that the stable motion is not mixing. And\nindeed, the behaviour in these regions, e.g. the motion on surviving tori or\nthe one near specific elliptic periodic points, is not mixing (Arnold and Avez\n[1968], pp. 86\u201390; Lichtenberg and Liebermann [1992], chapter 3\u20135).\n10In all these cases the invariant measure is also the unique ergodic measure absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure (Jacobsen [1981]; Lyubich [2002]).\n11This follows because these systems are isomorphic to a Bernoulli-shift.\n16\nI now turn to dissipative systems. Important here are (iii) nonchaotic\nattractors. These are attracting periodic cycles and fixed points and also\nquasi-periodic attractors as discussed by Ott ([2002], chapter 7), which obvi-\nously cannot be mixing. Moreover, the motion approaching such attractors,\ne.g. the behaviour around stable nodes or stable foci, clearly cannot be mixing\n(cf. Robinson [1995], p. 105).12\nFinally, let us mention two further very broad classes of clearly nonchaotic\nbehaviour. Since mixing captures SDIC, (iv) systems not exhibiting any kind\nof SDIC, e.g. the identity function, cannot be mixing.\nMoreover, since mixing captures denseness, (v) motions showing SDIC\nbut where, in any sense, typical solutions do not come arbitrarily near to any\nregion in phase space cannot be mixing. Examples are the system xn+1 = cxn\nfor c > 1 on (0,\u221e) or the motion around unstable nodes or unstable foci\n(cf. Robinson [1995], p. 105).12\nIn sum, I have first demonstrated that mixing captures the pretheoretic\nintuitions about chaos. After that I have briefly shown that a definition of\nchaos in terms of mixing is extensionally correct in the sense explained above.\nConsequently, chaos can be adequately defined in terms of mixing.\nWith this knowledge about chaos we are ready to critically discuss the\nanswers suggested in the literature to our main question.\n4 Criticism of Answers in the Literature\n4.1 New: Asymptotically Unpredictable?\nLet us first discuss an answer based on the concept of asymptotic unpredicta-\nbility. Roughly, systems whose asymptotic behaviour cannot be predicted\nwith arbitrary accuracy for all times, even if the bundle of initial conditions\nis made arbitrarily small, are said to be asymptotically unpredictable. Let\n(X, d, T ) be a topological dynamical system, \u03b5 be the desired prediction ac-\ncuracy and \u03b4 be the diameter of the bundle of initial conditions. For x \u2208 X\nthe solution (T n(x))n\u22650 is asymptotically predictable if and only if\n\u2200\u03b5 > 0 \u2203\u03b4 > 0 \u2200y \u2208 X \u2200n \u2265 0 (d(x, y) < \u03b4 \u2192 d(T n(x), T n(y)) < \u03b5). (7)\nA dynamical system is asymptotically unpredictable if and only if for all x \u2208 X\n(T n(x))n\u22650 is not asymptotically predictable.13 In terms of the distinction\n12Here there often exists no invariant measure of interest.\n13Bishop ([2003], pp. 174\u20137) also aims to formalise asymptotic unpredictability. How-\never, he does not list the most obvious notion presented here.\n17\nintroduced in subsection 2.3, this is clearly a version of the first concept of\nunpredictability.\nMiller ([1996], pp. 106\u20137) and Stone ([1989], p. 127) argue that the new\nimplication of chaos for unpredictability is that chaotic systems are asymp-\ntotically unpredictable. Indeed, all chaotic systems discussed in the literature\nare asymptotically unpredictable, and standard definitions of chaos imply\nasymptotic unpredictability. For instance, (5), a condition of Devaney chaos\nand, under plausible assumptions, a consequence of mixing, clearly implies\nasymptotic unpredictability.\nHowever, as Smith ([1998], p. 58) has pointed out, many nonchaotic sys-\ntems, e.g. one only showing SDIC as it happens in the system xn+1 = cxn,\nc > 1, (class (v) of clearly nonchaotic behaviour), are asymptotically un-\npredictable. Hence this account is wrong. But maybe the account can be\nstrengthened in the following way: the new implication is that chaotic sys-\ntems are asymptotically unpredictable and bounded. I maintain that this is not\ncorrect either: there are unbounded chaotic systems (Smith [1998], pp. 168\u2013\n9), a point which is reflected in usual definitions of chaos, which do not require\nboundedness. Furthermore, for many bounded integrable systems (part of\nclass (i) of the clearly nonchaotic behaviour) the solutions loop around tori\nin such a way that they are asymptotically unpredictable (Arnold and Avez\n[1968], pp. 210\u20134). Hence there are examples of nonchaotic, bounded and\nasymptotically unpredictable systems.\nI conclude that the sole connection between asymptotic unpredictability\nand chaos is this: while only some nonchaotic systems are asymptotically\nunpredictable, every chaotic system is asymptotically unpredictable.\n4.2 New: Unpredictable Due to Rapid or Exponential\nDivergence of Solutions?\nIt is widely believed and often claimed that the new implication of chaos\nfor unpredictability is the following: due to rapid or exponential divergence\nof nearby solutions, bundles of initial conditions spread out a distance more\nthan a diameter of interest over short time periods (e.g. Ruelle [1997], pp. 27\u2013\n8); often it is added that this is so and the systems are bounded (e.g. Lighthill\n[1986], p. 46). In terms of the distinction introduced in subsection 2.3, this\nis a form of the first concept of unpredictability.\nAs many unbounded nonchaotic systems like the system xn+1 = cxn with\nc > 1 show (part of class (v) of clearly nonchaotic behaviour) rapid or expo-\nnentially divergence everywhere is \u201cnothing new\u201d (Smith [1998], p. 15). Thus\nthe version not requiring boundedness cannot be true. But also the version\n18\nrequiring boundedness is wrong : as mentioned above, there are unbounded\nchaotic systems. Furthermore, as argued in subsection 3.2, it is often not\ntrue that nearby solutions of chaotic systems diverge rapidly or exponentially\nover finite time periods as is so widely believed in the philosophy, physics and\nmathematics communities (e.g. Eagle [2005], p. 767; Schurz [1996], p. 140;\nSmith [1998], p. 15). Hence this is not the sought-after new implication of\nchaos for unpredictability.\nWhy is it so widely believed that inaccuracies in chaotic systems spread\nrapidly or exponentially over finite time periods? One plausible reason is\nthat because very simple systems like the cat map show this property, this\nclaim is wrongly generalized to all chaotic systems. Also, the wrong belief\nstems at least in part from misinterpreting Liapunov exponents. As pointed\nout in subsection 3.2, positive on average exponential growth rates over an\ninfinite time period are wrongly taken to imply that inaccuracies spread\nexponentially over finite time periods.\nThe only connection between the unpredictability of chaos and the rapid\nor exponential increase of inaccuracies over finite time periods seems to be\nthis: it is more often the case for chaotic than for nonchaotic systems that\nbundles of initial conditions spread out more than a diameter of interest over\nshort time periods.\n4.3 New: Macro-predictable & Micro-unpredictable?\nMacro-predictable yet micro-unpredictable behaviour is a broad and inter-\nesting topic in physics. For instance, in statistical mechanics systems are\noften macro-predictable but micro-unpredictable. Here we concentrate only\non whether there is any combination of macro-predictability and micro-\nunpredictability in chaotic systems that other deterministic systems do not\nhave.\nTo gain an understanding of this third proposed answer, recall the Lorenz\nequations (3) and Figure 2. These equations exhibit macro-predictability:\nthe solutions are attracted by an attractor, a small region of phase space.\nThere is also micro-unpredictability since the motion on the attractor exhibits\nSDIC. Peter Smith argues that this combination of macro-predictability and\nmicro-unpredictability is a new implication of chaos for unpredictability :\nThis type of combination of large-scale order with small scale disorder,\nof macro-predictability with the micro-unpredictability due to sensitive\ndependence, is one paradigm of what has come to be called chaos. [...]\nSo error inflation by itself is entirely old-hat. The novelty in the new-\nfangled chaotic cases that will concern us is, to repeat, the combination\n19\nof exponential error inflation with the tight confinement of trajectories\nby an attractor (Smith [1998], pp. 13\u20135, original emphasis).\nHere macro-predictability means that the system eventually shows the\nbehaviour corresponding to the motion on the attractor, a proper subset of\nphase space. Micro-unpredictability is understood as the unpredictability\nimplied by exponential error inflation. Yet, as shown in section 3, solutions\nof chaotic systems need not diverge exponentially or rapidly over finite time\nperiods. Therefore, micro-unpredictability has to be interpreted as a weaker\nnotion, e.g. asymptotic unpredictability (cf. subsection 4.1).\nAs becomes clear from the Lorenz system, strange attractors imply this\ncombination of macro-predictability and micro-unpredictability. However,\nthis combination is no new implication of chaos for unpredictability since\nthere are many chaotic systems without attractors. As already pointed out,\nall chaotic volume-preserving dynamical systems like chaotic Hamiltonian\nsystems or the baker\u2019s map (classes (i), (ii) and (iii) of uncontroversially\nchaotic behaviour) cannot have attractors. And some chaotic dissipative\nsystems, e.g. repelling chaotic motion on Cantor sets or the logistic map on\n[0, 1] (class (vi) and a part of class (v) of uncontroverially chaotic behaviour),\nhave no attractors. Hence these systems are not macro-predictable in the\nabove sense, viz. that appeals to attractors.\nIt could be that Smith ([1998]) only meant to say that this combination of\nmacro-predictability and micro-unpredictability found in strange attractors\nis a novelty for systems with attractors. But this would not help. Clearly, this\nclaim would be no satisfying answer to our main question because it does not\napply to essentially all chaotic systems. Furthermore, also nonchaotic sys-\ntems can be macro-predictable and micro-unpredictable as discussed here.\nFor instance, in the plane let R be the region enclosed by a circle of radius r\naround the origin (boundary included). Imagine that all solutions in R go in\ncircles around the origin and that all solutions outside R are attracted by the\nperiodic motion in R such that all solutions are continuous. Such nonchaotic\nattractors (part of class (iii) of clearly nonchaotic behaviour) obviously im-\nply macro-predictability and micro-unpredictability. Thus this combination\nof macro-predictability and micro-unpredictability is not even a novelty for\nsystems with attractors.\nOf course, there are also other concepts of macro-predictability and micro-\nunpredictability (e.g. Smith [1998], pp. 60\u20131). However, to the best of my\nknowledge, none of them provides a combination of macro-predictability and\nmicro-unpredictability that is characteristic of chaotic behaviour.\nTo conclude, strange attractors are macro-predictable and micro-unpredictable\nin the above specified sense. However, it is not the case that a combination\n20\nof macro-predictability and micro-unpredictability constitutes a new impli-\ncation of chaos for unpredictability.\nNone of the answers examined so far have proven to be correct. There\nis one more answer suggested in the literature: some physicists, e.g. Ford\n([1989]), have defined chaos by the condition that almost all solutions have\npositive algorithmic complexity. In other words they have argued that the\nunpredictability implied by positive algorithmic complexity is a new impli-\ncation of chaos for unpredictability. However, Batterman and White ([1996])\nand Smith ([1998], p. 160) have made it clear that chaos cannot be defined\nvia algorithmic complexity since many systems without SDIC (part of class\n(iv) of clearly nonchaotic behaviour) have positive algorithmic complexity\ntoo. Consequently, this is no new implication of chaos for unpredictability,\nand this is all we need to know.\nIn sum, the answers in the literature do not fit the bill.\n5 A General New Implication of Chaos for\nUnpredictability\n5.1 Approximate Probabilistic Irrelevance\nThe answer I propose starts from the well-known idea that mixing goes along\nwith loss of information as recently discussed by Berkovitz et al. ([2006]).\nFirst of all, let us introduce the approximate probabilistic irrelevance, the\nnotion of unpredictability which will be crucial for our claim.\nGiven a measure-preserving system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) it is common to associate\nwith a set A \u2208 \u03a3 a property PA, where PA holds if and only if the system\u2019s\nstate is in A (Ibid., p. 671). For instance, for the logistic map with \u03b1 = 4\ninterpreted as a model of population dynamics (May [1976]), the set A =\n[0, 1\/2) corresponds to the property that the population is less than half of\nthe maximum of the possible population.\nBecause time is discrete, I can denote time points by tn, n \u2208 Z, such that\nn increases by one if the model is iterated once; for instance, if t4 corresponds\nto the iteration stage T , t5 corresponds to T\n2 etc. Given this, I define the\nevent Atn as the occurrence of the property PA at time tn. To come back\nto our example, Atn is the event that the population is less than half of the\nmaximum possible population at time tn (Berkovitz et al. [2006], p. 671).\nSince the exact state of the system may not be known, I introduce p(Atn),\nthe probability of the event Atn . I also introduce conditional probabilities:\np(Btm | Atn), for arbitrary A, B \u2208 \u03a3 with \u00b5(A) > 0, is the probability that\n21\nPB obtains at time tm given that PA obtained at tn (Ibid., p. 671). By the\nusual definition, p(Btm | Atn) = p(Btm&Atn)\/p(Atn).\nNow recall the second conception of unpredictability of subsection 2.3.\nFor this conception we have to say what it means that knowledge that the\nsystem is in a region A at tn is practically irrelevant for predicting that it\nwill be in B at tm. We say that this is so if the probability of the event B\ntm\ngiven knowledge of the event Atn approximately equals the unconditionalised\nprobability of the event Btm . Let \u03b5 > 0 be the level at which probabilities\ndiffering by less than \u03b5 are considered as practically equivalent. Further,\nassume that p(Atn) > 0; I will later explain why I am justified to do so.\nThen formally this is captured by the following definition:14\nAtn is approximately probabilistically irrelevant for predicting Btm (8)\n(tm \u2265 tn) at level \u03b5 > 0 if and only if |p(Btm | Atn)\u2212 p(Btm)| < \u03b5.\nHow can we determine the values of the probabilities occurring in (8)?\nBecause the probabilities should reflect objective dynamical properties of\nsystems, I say that the probability of an event Atn corresponds to the measure\nof A (Ibid., p. 673). As mentioned in subsection 2.1, this is quite natural\nunder certain interpretations.\nFor all tn and for all A \u2208 \u03a3 : p(Atn) = \u00b5(A). (9)\nThis idea can be generalised to joint simultaneous events as follows:\nFor all tn and for all A,B \u2208 \u03a3 : p(Atn&Btn) = \u00b5(A \u2229B). (10)\nThis implies:\nFor all tm, tn, tm \u2265 tn, and all A,B \u2208 \u03a3 : p(Btm&Atn) = \u00b5(T n\u2212m(B) \u2229 A)\n(11)\nsince T n\u2212m(B) is the evolution of the set B backward in time from tm to\ntn.\n15\nIn the next section we will see how the approximate probabilistic irrele-\nvance relates to chaos and will finally propose an answer to our question.\n14I use what is basically the difference measure in confirmation theory to define the\napproximate probabilistic irrelevance. I should point out that our claims are independent\nof the measure involved, i.e. they would remain the same if I used any other measure with\nthe indisputable property that it is continuous when the unpredictability is highest, i.e.\nwhen p(Btm | Atn) = p(Btm). Berkovitz et al. ([2006], p. 672) interpret the difference\nmeasure of events as a general measure of unpredictability. However, they do not justify\nthis choice or address whether their results are independent of the measure.\n15I can infer (11) from (10) as follows: Tn\u2212m(B) contains exactly those points that are\nin B at time tm. Consequently, Tn\u2212m(B) \u2229A consists of exactly those points which pass\nA at time tn and go through B at time tm \u2265 tn, i.e. for which Btm&Atn is true. Thus\nfrom (10) it follows that p(Btm&Atn) = \u00b5(Tn\u2212m(B) \u2229A).\n22\n5.2 New: Sufficiently Past Events Approximately Prob-\nabilistically Irrelevant for Predictions\nThe argument I put forward to answer the main question of the paper is as\nfollows. (P1) Chaos can be defined in terms of mixing. (P2) Mixing systems\nexhibit a particular pattern of approximate probabilistic irrelevance, which\nconstitutes a form of unpredictability. Therefore: (C) a new implication of\nchaos for unpredictability is the particular pattern of approximate probabilistic\nirrelevance arising from mixing.\nIn subsection 3.2 we have seen that premise (P1) is true. Let us now argue\nfor premise (P2). Recall the definition of mixing (4). I assume without loss\nof generality that the event we want to predict occurs at t0. Then, assuming\n(9) and (11), it follows that a system (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is mixing if and only if\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\np(Bt0 | At\u2212n)\u2212 p(Bt0) = 0, (12)\nfor all A,B \u2208 \u03a3 with \u00b5(A) > 0. This equation holds for all, i.e. invert-\nible and noninvertible, measure-preserving systems. Berkovitz et al. ([2006],\np. 676) show (12) only for invertible systems. Moreover, they interpret their\nresults as applying only to Hamiltonian systems. Many chaotic systems, e.g.\nall strange attractors (classes (iv) and (v) of uncontroversially chaotic be-\nhaviour), are not Hamiltonian. Furthermore, many paradigmatic systems\nlike generalised logistic systems or the tent map (class (v) and part of classes\n(iii) and (vi) of uncontroversially chaotic behaviour) are not invertible. Since\nI am interested in the unpredictability implied by chaos, I need (12) for all\nsystems, and this general claim follows from (9) and (11).\nFrom the definition of the limit, I obtain that (12) can be expressed as:\nFor any event Bt0 , any precision \u03b5 > 0 and any A with \u00b5(A) > 0 (13)\nthere exists n0 \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 n0 : |p(Bt0 | At\u2212n)\u2212 p(Bt0)| < \u03b5.\nHence mixing means that for predicting an arbitrary event at an arbitrary\nlevel of precision \u03b5 > 0, any sufficiently past event is approximately prob-\nabilistically irrelevant. Notice that due to the impossibility of determining\ninitial conditions precisely, scientists always consider regions of phase space\ncorresponding to possible initial conditions. Since these regions are not of\nmeasure zero, I am justified assuming that \u00b5(A) > 0. In terms of the dis-\ntinction introduced in subsection 2.3, this pattern of probabilistic irrelevance\nis a version of the second concept of unpredictability. Hence mixing systems\nexhibit a particular pattern of approximate probabilistic irrelevance, which\nconstitutes a form of unpredictability: i.e. premise (P2) is true.16\n16This claim can be generalised. (X,\u03a3, \u00b5, T ) is mixing iff for any \u03c1 absolutely continuous\n23\nNow that I have argued for the premises (P1) and (P2) of the above argu-\nment, I conclude: (C) a general new implication of chaos for unpredictability\nis that for predicting any event at any level of precision \u03b5 > 0, all sufficiently\npast events are approximately probabilistically irrelevant.\nTo fully understand this conclusion, consider the following: for strange\nattractors this claim applies in a strict sense only to events on the attractor.\nYet for practical matters there is chaotic behaviour when solutions are very\nnear to the strange attractor (cf. subsection 2.1); then my claim means that\nfor predicting any event on or very near the attractor \u039b at any level of\nprecision \u03b5 > 0, all sufficiently past events in the neighbourhood U \u2283 \u039b are\napproximately probabilistically irrelevant. For KAM-type systems my claim\napplies, as one would like it, to each chaotic region. Moreover, as explained in\nsection 3.2 in discussing the uncontroversially chaotic behaviour, some may\nwant to adopt the broad definition of chaos via mixing, i.e. that the system is\nergodic and its phase space is decomposable into n \u2265 1 regions with disjoint\ninterior such that the n-th iterate is mixing on each set. When n > 1, my\nclaim (C) has to be adapted in the following way: the unpredictability of\nmixing applies to the n-th iterate on the region of interest. This means that\nfor predicting any event in the region of interest at any level of precision\n\u03b5 > 0, all sufficiently past events that could have evolved to the region of\ninterest are approximately probabilistically irrelevant.\nOn the one hand, the unpredictability involved in my answer is strong:\nsufficiently distant events are practically as independent as coin tosses. On\nthe other hand, it is weak since only sufficiently past measurements are ap-\nproximately probabilistically irrelevant. Restricting my claim to sufficiently\npast events is essential: first, many chaotic systems are continuous, and conti-\nnuity makes it impossible that for all past times, all events are approximately\nprobabilistically irrelevant for predictions. Second, we have seen that to re-\nquire rapid divergence of nearby solutions for chaotic behaviour is untenable.\nWhat is novel about my claim? Granted, in a few publications on chaos\nthe notion of \u2018irrelevance\u2019 is discussed. In fact, there are two main foci; but\nnone give my claim. First, there is Berkovitz et al.\u2019s ([2006]) explication of\nthe ergodic hierarchy. Yet recall our main argument (cf. the beginning of\nthis subsection). As pointed out, Berkovitz et al. only show premise (P2) for\ninvertible systems, and they interpret their results as only applying to Hamil-\nwith respect to \u00b5 and any square integrable function f : limn\u2192\u221e\n\u222b\nf(x)d\u03c1n =\n\u222b\nf(x)d\u00b5,\nwhere \u03c1n is the n-steps evolved measure. Interpret \u00b5 as probability and \u03c1 as measuring\nour knowledge of the initial condition. Then, assuming absolute continuity of \u03c1, mixing\nmeans that for arbitrary knowledge of the initial condition after a sufficiently long time\nthe prediction obtained by evolving the measure is practically no better than if we had no\nknowledge whatsoever of the initial conditions (cf. Berger [2001], pp. 126\u201332).\n24\ntonian systems. Hence they do not argue for the general premise (P2), and,\nmost importantly, they do not argue for the crucial premise (P1). Therefore,\nthey could not arrive at the conclusion (C). Second, sometimes it is asserted\nthat for chaos the input is irrelevant in the sense that prediction is exponen-\ntially expensive in the initial data, meaning that for an input string of length\nn all information is lost after n steps, at which point we are totally unsure\nwhat happens next (Leiber [1998], p. 361; Smith [1998], p. 53). However,\nas argued in subsection 4.2, predictions for chaotic systems need not be ex-\nponentially expensive in the initial data; the irrelevance shown by chaos is\nmore subtle.\n6 Conclusion\nThe unpredictability of chaotic systems is one of the issues that has attracted\nmost interest in chaos research. Nonetheless, nearly half a century after the\nstart of the systematic investigation of chaos, there has been much confusion\nabout, and no correct answer to, the question \u2018What are the new implica-\ntions of chaos for unpredictability?\u2019, in the sense that chaotic systems are\nunpredictable in a way that other deterministic systems are not.\nI have criticised the answers in the literature to the above question.\nFirst, I rejected the answer that chaotic systems are asymptotically unpre-\ndictable on the grounds that also many nonchaotic systems are asymptot-\nically unpredictable. Second, I rejected the answer that chaotic systems\nare unpredictable in the sense of exponential or rapid divergence of nearby\nsolutions (often claimed with the added condition of boundedness). For,\nwhen not requiring boundedness, many nonchaotic systems are also unpre-\ndictable in this sense. Furthermore, in the case of requiring boundedness,\nthere are unbounded chaotic systems and, though unacknowledged in the\nphilosophy literature, chaotic systems need not be unpredictable in the sense\nof having exponential or rapid divergence of solutions. Third, I dismissed\nthe answer that chaos shows a specific combination of macro-predictability\nand micro-unpredictability: there are chaotic systems which are not macro-\npredictable and nonchaotic systems which also show this combination of\nmacro-predictability and micro-unpredictability.\nThis prompted the search for an alternative answer. I approached this\nproblem by showing that chaos can be defined in terms of mixing, i.e. that\nmixing captures the main pretheoretic intuitions about chaos and correctly\nclassifies the various classes of uncontroversially chaotic and nonchaotic be-\nhaviour. This has never been explicitly argued for in the literature. Based\non this insight, I proposed a novel general answer: a new implication of chaos\n25\nfor unpredictability is that for predicting any event at any level of precision\n\u03b5 > 0, all sufficiently past events are approximately probabilistically irrele-\nvant. Chaotic behaviour is multi-faceted and takes various forms. Yet if the\naim is to identify a general new implication of chaos for unpredictability, I\nthink this is the best we can get.\nAcknowledgments\nI am indebted to Jeremy Butterfield, Roman Frigg, Peter Smith and two\nanonymous referees for valuable comments on earlier versions of this pa-\nper.
