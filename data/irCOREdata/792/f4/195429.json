INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, almost all areas of X-ray instrumentation have seen rapid development, allowing astronomers\nto gain an improved understanding of celestial X-ray sources and the processes involved in driving them. These\nadvancements are embodied by the successes of Chandra1 and XMM-Newton,2 where new mirror and detector\ntechnologies enabled unprecedented spatial and energy resolution, providing a significant expansion in our un-\nderstanding of astrophysical X-ray sources. Major new advances can also be expected in astronomical X-ray\nspectroscopy, through the deployment of cryogenically cooled detectors. Elsewhere, the study of transient ob-\njects and time variability is being addressed by new X-ray all sky monitor proposals such as the UK-led Lobster\nmission,3 while the Swift observatory (launched November 2004) leads the quest to understand explosive Gamma\nRay Bursts.\nIn contrast, astronomical X-ray polarimetry remains as unexplored now as it was 30 years ago. Conventional\nX-ray polarimetry relies on the Bragg reflection4 or Thomson scattering5 of photons. Although polarimeters\nbased on these physical principles have flown on sounding rockets,6 and on the Ariel-57 and OSO-88 satellites, to\ndate only one unambiguous measurement of polarisation in a cosmic X-ray source has been made - that of 19%\nlinear polarisation at 2.6 keV for the Crab Nebula.9 The low photon fluxes received from astronomical objects,\ncombined with narrow bandwidth (for Bragg crystal polarimeters10,11) or low scattering efficiency (for Thomson\nscatterers) have rendered polarisation observations insensitive to all but the brightest sources.\nIn this paper we describe the difficulties of practical X-ray polarimetry (XRP) and review past and current\ninstrumentation to exploit the polarization of celestial sources. We explain the concept of narrow bandwidth\nFurther author information: (Send correspondence to A.M., K.D.M.H. or G.A.S)\nA.M.: E-mail: adrian.martindale@star.le.ac.uk, Telephone: +44 (0)116 252 2650\nK.D.M.H.: E-mail: HarrisKDM@Cardiff.ac.uk, Telephone: +44 (0)29 2087 0133\nG.A.S.: E-mail: gas8@le.ac.uk, Telephone: +44 (0)116 252 2096:\ndichroic filters, and describe how such devices could add a polarimetry capability to the cryogenic focal planes\nof the next generation of X-ray observatory. This work was undertaken as part of a one year feasibility study\nfunded by the Research councils of the UK (RCUK) basic technology programme. The goal of this study was\nto investigate whether these filters are capable of delivering a simple, compact, low mass X-ray polarimeter for\nfuture X-ray astronomical observatories.\n2. POLARISATION OF X-RAYS\nThe degeneracy in predictions from competing astrophysical models, when constrained only by photometric and\nspectroscopic observations, can be broken by measuring the degree (P ) and angle (\u03b8) of polarization. Despite\nsimilar predictions for the current observables, the models often predict differences in P and \u03b8, and also differences\nin how their values change when the observer wishes to discriminate the polarisation as a function of time\nand\/or photon energy. X-ray polarimetry therefore promises the realization of the next milestone in X-ray\nastronomy by addressing many areas of interest, but where the most exciting and influential results from a new\ndetector technology are usually those which are unexpected. In this section we review some current problems in\nastrophysics which would benefit from an efficient polarimeter.\nIf emitted in a thermal process, photons will be unpolarized (assuming they do not undergo any polariza-\ntion dependent process along the light path - e.g. scattering or transiting a region of intense magnetic field).\nConversely, if photons are produced in a non-thermal process, they will have some intrinsic polarization whose\ndegree and direction can be used to identify the driving emission process. The measurement of 19% linear X-ray\npolarization in the Crab nebula9 was used to confirm the synchrotron nature of the observed X-ray spectrum\nwhich was long suspected owing to its power law nature. However, it was not until the polarisation was measured\nthat it was possible to exclude a complex thermal spectrum. This demonstrates the power of polarimetry to\ndiscriminate between astrophysical models.\nMany emission processes can cause polarization of photons. Weisskopf et. al. review a number of such mecha-\nnisms, concentrating on the use of polarimetry to understand neutron star systems;12 identifying the variation in\npolarization as a function of pulsar phase as a prime example of where X-ray polarimetric data could distinguish\nbetween competing astrophysical models. The authors also describe a method of obtaining possible observational\nevidence for vacuum birefringence - an exotic effect of quantum electrodynamics (QED). This theory predicts\nthat in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the refractive index of a vacuum is different for orthogonally\npolarized photons. Consequently, certain models of pulsar emission predict variation in the polarization depen-\ndence as a function of pulsar phase and photon energy. Weisskopf et. al. predict a \u223c 10\u25e6 phase lag between\noptical and X-ray polarization angle as a function of pulsar period for the Crab pulsar owing to this effect.\nA number of other authors have reviewed the possible impact of X-ray polarimetry on different astrophysical\nprocesses demonstrating the broad interest in polarimetry across the astrophysics community.10,13\u201315\n3. X-RAY POLARIMETERS\nSoffitta et. al. (2003) review past and present instrumentation for X-ray astrophysical polarimetry.11 The\nauthors show that Bragg crystal polarimeters are insensitive to all but the brightest sources because of the narrow\nband, dispersive technique that they employ. Also, the Thompson scattering technique, in which measuring the\nazimuthal distribution of photons scattered from a low atomic number medium yields P and \u03b8, is shown to\nbe inefficient. The origin of this inefficiency is twofold; first, the intrinsically weak scattering in the medium\nmeans that only a small fraction of incident photons are subject to the modulation, the dependence of scattering\nefficiency on atomic number (z) means that low-z materials must be used. Second is the acceptance of photons\nat angles other than normal incidence in order to increase the number of photons incident on the detector. The\nauthors state that a perfectly collimated device would have perfect modulation. However, to improve photon\nstatistics, it is necessary to accept photons arriving within a discrete range of angles, this reduces modulation\nfactor.\nThe intrinsically weak nature of past polarimeters means that a better method of measuring beam polarisation\nis needed, recent polarimeters have relied on the polarization dependence of photoelectron emission to convert\nbeam polarization into a measurable quantity. When an X-ray is incident onto a material, an electron is emitted\nif the photon energy is greater than the work function of the material. This is the photoelectric effect, and the\npreferred direction of emission of the photoelectron is in the plane of the electric field of the photon.\nElectrons can also be excited into higher bound states in a molecule. Although this is not generally the case\nfor isolated atoms or ions; in a molecule, electrons can be excited from the bonding orbital into higher, bound\nstates such as the anti-bonding orbital. In this case the electronic structure around the molecule provides the\n\u201callowed states\u201d into which the electron can be excited. Therefore, the absorption probability of the photon\ncan be a function of the polarization of the photon and the local electronic structure. It should be noted that\nphoto-ionization is still possible and is a special case of this more general description, where the free electron\nis excited into the infinite band of allowed states outside of the atomic potential. Both photo-ionization and\nexcitation to higher, bound states can potentially provide the active element of a practical X-ray polarimeter.\nThis effect has been investigated in two proposed practical polarimeters where either the efficiency of the\nphotocathode of an MCP16 or the presence of split pixel events in a CCD17 image yield the mean polarization\ndirection of a beam. These effects proved too weak and inefficient for a practical instrument owing to the falling\nefficiency of the CCD at the high energies needed to excite split pixel events, or the difficulty of discriminating\nbetween a true polarization modulation of the beam and spurious systematic effects in the MCP system.\n3.1 Novel X-ray Polarimeters\nIn 2001, Costa et. al. proposed a micro-structured proportional counter which could directly image the emission\ndirection of photoelectrons in the absorbing gas volume.18 In this design, a histogram of emission directions is\nproduced. The maximum intensity in the histogram corresponds to the mean polarization direction of the incident\nbeam and the depth of the sinusoidal modulation curve gives the polarized fraction. Jahoda et. al. describe\nan evolution of this device, using a time projection chamber rather than a gas electron multiplier to image the\nphotoelectrons.19 These divices are proposed for inclusion on the next generation of great observatories, XEUS\nand Constellation-X (Con-X).\nBannister et. al. (2006) describe a novel way to exploit the polarization dependence of photo-excitation\nof core level electrons which yields a polarization sensitive transmission filter.20 The polarization sensitivity\narises from the difference in transmission of a family of materials which exhibit dichroism in narrow (\u223c 10 eV)\nenergy bands close to atomic absorption edges, where the electron is excited into a bound, molecular orbital.\nThe simplicity of such a device makes it an ideal instrument for future X-ray observatories as it decouples the\npolarization sensitivity from the intrinsic efficiency of the detector. When combined with the high efficiency and\nenergy resolution of the cryogenic instrumentation under development for future telescopes such as XEUS and\nCon-X, these filters may offer a simple and compact method of measuring X-ray polarisation in a large number\nof astrophysical sources, finally ending the 35 year hiatus in this field.\n4. DICHROIC FILTERS\nIn 1967, Auton21 showed that a wire grid of period d will effectively polarize light of wavelength \u03bb if d \u2264 \u03bb\/2.\nAt visible wavelengths, polarization can be detected using highly ordered materials such as Polaroid H-sheet, a\ncommercially available polymer sheet which is used in LCD displays and sunglasses. H-sheet consists of long\nchain polyvinyl alcohol molecules which are stretched during manufacture to ensure that all polymer chains are\nuniformly aligned. Doping these chains with iodine makes them conduct along their length, imposing a preferred\naxis on the material in which light polarized parallel to the chains is efficiently absorbed, while light polarized\nin a direction perpendicular to the chains is transmitted.\nDespite the wavelength dependence of the wire grid dichroic polarizers, which should preclude the operation\nof materials such as H-sheet at X-ray wavelengths, Collins (1997) reports the successful analysis of polarization\nof 33.17 keV X-rays using ordinary H-sheet.22 The underlying physics explaining this result is very different\nfrom that which governs optical wavelength polarization.\nThe nanoscopic structure of H-sheet was identified as the cause for the difference in transmission of the filter\nas a function of the azimuthal angle between the beam polarization and the principal axis of the polarizer.\nThe long chains of doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) molecules produce a different electronic structure in two\nperpendicular axes; the number of allowed molecular electronic states must therefore differ in these two axes.\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n13.5413.5213.5013.4813.4613.44\nEnergy (keV)\nFr\nac\ntio\nna\nl A\nbs\nor\npt\nio\nn\nFigure 1. Transmission spectra from Collins 200223 for a dibromoalkane - urea compound the upper curve is the parameter\nR\u03b3 which is the ratio of the perpendicular and parallel attenuation coefficients for the polariser. The black curve is for\nthe case where the polarisation is parallel to the polariser axis and the gray curve is for polarisation perpendicular to\nthis axis(left). Our results for a bromoadamantane\/thiourea compound, taken at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation\nSource (SRS) beamline 16.3 are shown where the solid line is for polarisation parallel to the polarizer axis and the dashed\nline is for polarisation perpendicular to this axis (right).\nAs the most probable direction of ejection of a photoelectron is parallel to the polarization vector of the photon,\nthe absorption probability differs in these two principal axes, leading to a difference in the X-ray absorption\ncoefficient. The energy bands into which the electron can be exited are discrete (and narrow) and therefore the\nchange in transmission occurs over a narrow range of energies, leading to fine structure in the absorption spectra.\nThis is known as X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and is a function of polarization state, meaning that\nwithin energy bands of \u223c10 eV the filer is dichroic (i.e. it shows different transmission according to whether the\nsource is polarized parallel or perpendicular to the principal axis of the filter).\nA material designed with highly ordered and different electronic structure in two perpendicular axes is\ntherefore expected to produce an efficient polarizer in \u223c 10 eV bands around the absorption edge of the atom\nunder excitation. To design such a material, single crystals with highly ordered bonding structure are required,\nwhich give rise to a preferred transmission axis in the material. Our initial attempts at producing such materials,\nbased on the previous experience of KDMH and SC, concentrated on inclusion compounds, where the molecules\nare constrained to have a particular orientation owing to the fact that they are held within a tunnel-like host\nsubstance. The host matrix is used to confine molecules of interest into a structure where their chemical bonds\nremain coaligned with the axes of the host tunnel. The hosts of interest here are Urea and Thiourea, which\ncrystalise into tunnel structures, these can be engineered to contain diverse guest molecules of interest. The host\nmaterial acts to reduce the transmission of the filter without adding to the dichroic response and although this\nis not a problem for high energy photons (as the absorption in the host is small) at lower energies, absorption in\nthe host dominates.\nThe initial attempts to make polarising filters concentrated on a dibromoalkane\/urea compound23 (Figure\n1 [left]), this was shown to be an unoptimised material because the bonds in the guest molecule did not align\nperfectly with the tunnel axis. Bromoadamantane\/thiourea exhibits perfectly aligned bonding with the tunnel\naxis and Figure 1 [right] shows that this is a much better polarisation analyser as the strength of the differential\neffect is increased by the better bond alignment. A completely new approach, where coordination chemistry is\nused to constrain directionality in the crystal is possible but will be described elsewhere.\n5. ASTROPHYSICAL INSTRUMENT\nThe efficiency of polarimeters is defined in terms of two figures of merit: the modulation factor (M) and minimum\ndetectable polarisation (MDP ). The modulation factor is defined as;\nM =\n(\nC\u22a5 \u2212 C\u2016\n)\n(\nC\u22a5 + C\u2016\n) . (1)\nHere C\u22a5 and C\u2016 are the count rates experienced by the detector with the polarimeter axis perpendicular\nand parallel to the beam polarization vector for a 100% polarised beam. The minimum detectable polarisation\nMDP is defined by Novick et. al.13 as the 3\u03c3 or 99% confidence limit of a polarimeter;\nMDP = P (3\u03c3) =\n3\nMS\n(\n2\n(\nS +B\nT\n))1\/2\n. (2)\nIn this expression, P (3\u03c3) is the 99% confidence limit of the measurement, defining the MDP for a source,\nS is the signal counting rate, B is the background count rate, T is the observing time and M is the modulation\nfactor as defined above. If a polarisation P > P (3\u03c3) is measured, it is 99% certain that the effect is real and\nnot a statistical anomaly.\nFor astrophysicaly useful measurements, a polarimeter must be capable of measuring 1% polarisation for a\nnumber of celestial sources. This limit is imposed by the fact that a typical polarisation at other wavelengths\n(e.g. optical and radio) is of order 1%, and by the need to resolve polarisation in a large number of different\ntargets.\nWe have shown20 that the minimum detectable polarization for a number of sources could compare favorably\nto the micro-structured proportional counter instrument24 based on the XEUS effective area and assuming the\ndetectors are capable of resolving the edges of interest. We showed MDP values of a few percent for four active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) at 2.8 keV assuming the success of the bromine polarisers could be replicaeted at Cl-K\n(2.8 keV), we also showed much better than 1% MDP for these sources if a filter could be made to operate at\nlower energies (\u223c 1 keV and below).\nOptimisation of the thickness of the filter, specifically to minimise MDP , could significantly improve the\nfilter performance even for the high energy edges such as Br-K. However, we expect to get \u2264 3% MDP at 13.5\nkeV for the Crab nebula with existing (unoptimised) filters based on the Br-K edge in a 105 s observarion with\nXEUS. Although theoretically by optimising the filter such that there is zero transmission in one axis and the\nmodulation factor is 100%, in practise a tradeoff is needed between modulation factor and photon counting\nstatistics, this will be investigated in future work. It should also be noted that although 3% MDP seems rather\nmodest, the peak intensity of the spectrum lies significantly below the 13.5 keV edge, and also the effective area\nof the telescope is relatively low at this high energy meaning that the number of incident photons is low and\nphoton statistics will be poor. The goal of the next phase of study is to push the dichroic filters to lower energy,\nwhere the telescope effective area and the intensity from the source is significantly higher. Future work will\ninclude a more comprehensive study of a number of different types of sources and the sensitivity of a dichroic\nfilter to their polarisation. We are confident that in extending the dichroic response to lower energies, the MDP\nwill be competitive.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the results of our one year feasibility study, we conclude that it is possible to engineer dichroic\nmaterials to perform as transmissive polarising filters at X-ray wavelengths. Despite the narrow energy bands,\nthe development of cryogenic spectrometers, capable of resolving the \u223c 10 eV dichroic bandwidth of the filter\noffers an efficient method of making such measurements. Although predictions are only made for XEUS, the\nresults are scalable to Con-X as the MDP is governed by photon statistics and therefore scales in proportion\nto the observing time and the effective area. Work is ongoing and shows significant promise in extending the\nenergies of interest to lower, more useful energy absorption edges.\n7.
