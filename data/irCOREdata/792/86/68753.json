INTRODUCTION \nProfit sharing has been shown to be associated with higher firm profitability, labor productivity \nand worker wages (Bhargara 1994, Cable and Wilson 1989, Estrin et al. 1997, Hubler 1993, \nKruse 1992, 1993, Wadhwani and Wall 1990).  Yet, the recognized 1\/N problem suggests that \nfree riding dramatically limits the effectiveness of profit sharing as a direct incentive device to \nelicit greater effort and productivity. While particular technologies or forms of group behavior \ncan help reduce the 1\/N problem (Fitzroy and Kraft 1987; Adams 2006; Heywood and Jirjahn \n2009), an alternative causation contends that profit sharing improves productivity by increasing \ninvestment in worker training.  This paper estimates the influence of profit sharing on the \nprovision of training. \n There exist two strands from the literature suggesting how profit sharing spurs training. In \nthe first, profit sharing plays an indirect role by reducing separation (Azfar and Danninger 2001; \nGielen 2007).  This reduced separation increases the expected amortization period for training \ninvestments and this, in turn, increases the likelihood of training. In the second, profit sharing \nplays a direct role either by creating a contract that rewards training thereby reducing fears of a \nhold-up problem and\/or by encouraging co-workers to provide training (Itoh 1991, Parent 2004). \nWe are the first to estimate the relationship between training and profit sharing in a framework \nthat allows for both of these roles. \n  We mimic earlier work showing that the probability of separation is lower in the presence \nof profit sharing and that profit sharing stands as an important determinant of both receiving \ntraining and of its intensity.  Critically, we extend these estimates to explicitly distinguish the \ndirect and indirect effects.  A series of recursive bivariate probits present a mixed pattern.  For \neach of the measures designed to capture training, we confirm a direct effect but find evidence of \n  2 \nan indirect effect through separation only when examining separation within a short period and \nonly for certain types of training. While the joint estimation routinely confirms the role of profit \nsharing in reducing separation rates, those reduced rates often have little or no influence on \ntraining. These results suggest that profit sharing may increase investments in training by \neliminating either hold up problems or lowering the cost of coworker provision but provide only \nmodest support for the role played by reduced separation.  \n The next section highlights the hypothesis that profit sharing increases training but \nemphasizes the critical need for a new testing strategy.  The third section reviews our data and the \nmethods used.  The fourth section presents the evidence on the association between profit sharing \nand job separation and between profit sharing and training.  The fifth section summarizes our \nestimates that allow for both direct effects of profit sharing and indirect effects through reduced \nseparation. A final section concludes. \n \n2. PROFIT SHARING AND TRAINING  \nWhile the link between productivity and profit sharing may have several sources, one important \nsuggestion is that profit sharing increases training.1  This importance grows when recognizing \nthat the usual \"incentive for effort\" argument is undermined by the well-recognized 1\/N problem.  \nParent (2004) presents convincing evidence that workers who received profit sharing on a \nprevious job earn higher wages on their current job even in the absence of profit sharing on the \ncurrent job. This he claims is unlikely in a model of eliciting effort but fits with the alternative \nconjecture that profit sharing is associated with greater investment in skills, including skills \ntransferable between employers.  \n                                                 \n1Additional possibilities include that profit sharing reduces absence. See Wilson and Peel (1991), Brown et al. \n(1999), Chelius and Smith (1990) and Heywood and Jirjahn (2004). \n  3 \n There exist two broad variations in the literature as to why profit sharing may increase \ntraining and so influence worker productivity.  The first emphasizes the importance of profit \nsharing on separations and we label this a model of indirect causation as it suggests that the \nreduced separations are ultimately responsible for the greater incidence of training and so the \nhigher productivity.  The second variation is largely unrelated to separation and we label it a \nmodel of direct causation. Previous literature has not distinguished empirically between the direct \nand indirect models. \n Profit sharing may reduce employee separations encouraging investment in firm specific \ncapital as the expected amortization period for such investments grows. Kruse (1992) argues that \nworkers may reduce their initiated separations because profit sharing \"leads to greater \nidentification with the firm,\" because workers may value the stronger link between compensation \nand effort implied by profit sharing and because when times are good and most favorable for \nemployee job search, compensation naturally increases with profit sharing.  At the same time, \nfirms may reduce their initiated separations because profit sharing reduces the marginal cost of \nlabor during periods of weak firm performance making redundancy less likely (Weitzman 1984).  \nThe existing evidence on the relationship between profit sharing and separation is somewhat \nmixed.  D'Art and Turner (2004) fail to find any influence of profit sharing on separation in their \nlarge survey of firms in 11 European countries.  Chelius and Smith (1990) found only \n\"borderline\" evidence in earlier US data claiming it was at best \"suggestive.\" These studies \ncontrast with the more recent US individual level estimations of Azfar and Danninger (2001) \nshowing a strong negative influence of profit sharing on the probability of a worker being made \n  4 \nredundant and also showing a negative influence of profit sharing on the probability of a worker \nquitting.2  \n Azfar and Danninger (2001) combine their evidence that profit sharing reduces \nseparations with similarly strong evidence that profit sharing is associated with increased \ntraining. They show that workers with profit sharing were 25 percent more like to receive training \nand that when trained, they received significantly more training as well.  They argue that the \ncombined findings that profit sharing reduces separations and that it increases training \"support \nour hypothesis that greater job stability increases investment in firm-specific training\"   (Azfar \nand Danninger 2001, p. 626). Gielen (2007) uses UK data in a roughly similar fashion confirming \nin a single equation estimate that profit sharing increases the likelihood of training and in a \nseparate estimate that both training and profit sharing reduce the likelihood of separation. \n While recognizing the importance findings, the argument for indirect causation between \nprofit sharing and training relies upon the reduced separation probability increasing the likelihood \nof training. Although longer expected tenure is taken as a basic theoretical determinant of training \n(Lynch 1991, 1993), the influence of reduced separation probabilities on training may not be \nlarge if firm specific training is actually rare, as indicated by Lowenstein and Spletzer (1999), and \nif most periods of unemployment following separation are short or non-existent. Thus, Royalty \n(1996) estimates the influence of predicted separation probabilities on the incidence of employer-\nprovided training.  She finds that the probability of \"job to job\" separation (the majority of \nseparations for men) has no influence on training and that only the probability of \"job to non-\nemployment\" separation has a negative influence. This confirms the importance of expected \n                                                 \n2\n Arranz-Aprete (2005) uses individual data from Finland confirming the negative influence of profit sharing on \nseperation. Earlier work by Kraft (1991) confirms that profit sharing decreases the number of dismissals while Kruse \n(1991) used more aggregate data showing that profit sharing firms had smaller employment decreases during \neconomic downturns. \n  5 \nemployment duration not expected tenure duration. Veum (1997) finds a positive association \nbetween training off-the-job and worker separation and, at best, a weak negative association \nbetween employer-provided training and separation. Levine (1993) finds no evidence that across \nplants lower separation rates are associated with greater training. Using UK data Green et al \n(2000) find no relationship between training and mobility, while Elias (1994) finds no \nstatistically significant link between male separation and the receipt of employer provided formal \ntraining.  In short, researchers interested in the influence of profit sharing on training should not \ntake for granted that a reduced probability of separation necessarily increases training.  Moreover, \neven an observed correlation is not evidence of causation as training with employer specific \naspects may cause longer tenure as separation causes lost returns.  \nInstead of an indirect influence through separation, there may be a direct link between \nprofit sharing and training. Two channels have been suggested in the literature explaining how \nprofit sharing may directly increase training. First, profit sharing has been seen as an explicit \ncontract that helps alleviate the well-known \"hold-up problem\" associated with investments in \nfirm specific training (FitzRoy and Kraft 1987). Firm specific skills are inherently difficult to \ncontract upon and because they have no market value firms cannot be trusted to share the rents \nover those skills without resort to strong reputation effects.  Moreover, even for general training, \nworkers may fear a hold-up problem from their current employer if it is costly or time consuming \nto find alternative employment. Thus, \"by writing a contract in which it is specified that workers \nget a certain percentage of profits, workers can feel more confident that they will not be held up \nex post (Parent 2004: 38).\" This may lead workers under profit sharing arrangements to devote \nmore time investing in skills.  Interestingly, this function might well be played by alternative \nperformance pay schemes that allow workers to capture returns on their investment in training \n  6 \nand improved performance (Kraft 1991).  As a result, we will examine the role of both profit \nsharing and individual performance pay throughout our analysis.  In either case, it is the explicit \ncontract that rewards increased productivity that causes the investment not an indirect influence \nthrough a decreased risk of separation. \n Second, profit sharing has been seen as directly encouraging \"helping effort\" in which \nworkers allocate effort not only to their own tasks but also to assisting with the tasks of \ncoworkers (Itoh 1991).  Profit sharing thus helps reduce the confirmed tendency under individual \nincentives of ignoring the profitable allocation of effort to helping coworkers (Drago and Garvey \n1996).  Critically, training has very large elements of helping effort.  Co-workers provide a large \nshare of both formal and informal on-the-job training and do so by taking time away from other \nduties (Barron et al. 1989).   The time and effort workers spend training co-workers has been \nthought to depend on the incentives they face.  Profit sharing reduces the tendency to under-\nprovide training effort.  Indeed, Morrison and Wilhelm (2004) emphasize the role played by co-\nworker training in professional service firms (such law firms) arguing that partnership \narrangements in which the trained workers retain a share of profit are critical to ensuring that the \nappropriate degree of training is provided to new hires.  Similarly, Encinosa et al. (2007) find that \nU.S. doctors receiving a share of firm profits rather than receiving earnings based on their \nindividual contributions are more likely to consult with one another about cases and provide their \nexpertise to colleagues. In this view profit sharing increases the incentive for informal and on-\nthe-job training by co-workers and supervisors who might otherwise emphasize their own tasks.  \nIn this case, individual performance pay should work in the opposite direction as profit sharing.  \nExplicit rewards for workers' own productivity should be at odds with helping and training newer \n  7 \nhires as the diverted time increases overall productivity but not in ways rewarded by an \nindividual based scheme. \n \n3. DATA  AND APPROACH \nWe use two longitudinal data sets from the UK that sample similar populations within similar \ntime frames, the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the 5 quarter longitudinal version \nof the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS). The BHPS is an annual longitudinal survey from 1991 to \n2004. The longitudinal version of the LFS we use has been running since 1992 and comprises a \nfive quarter rolling panel where each quarter a new cohort is observed. For both data sets, we \nlimit our sample to male employees aged 20-65 who were not employed in the public sector.  \n We use these two data sets as each has off-setting strengths with respect to payment \nmethod information. The chief advantage of the LFS is its detailed measures of payment \nmethods. From 1999 onwards, individuals record separately if they received tips, piece rates, \nbonuses, profit shares and a variety of compensatory wages (locality allowances, shift allowances \netc).3 However, payment information is only available in the LFS for the first and last quarter that \nthe individual is observed. Hence, for our purposes, it has only a limited panel dimension. The \ninformation on payment schemes in the BHPS is available for 1998 onwards and the questions \nasked are, \"In the last 12 months have you received any bonuses such as a Christmas or quarterly \nbonus, profit-related pay or profit sharing bonus, or an occasional commission?\", this excludes \novertime payments; and \"Does your pay include performance related pay\" (Taylor et al, 2006).  \nHence the categorization of profit share receipt in the BHPS is broad.  A key difference between \nthe two data sets is the time domain that the payment method questions cover. For the BHPS, \n                                                 \n3\n We group tips and piece rates into one category (performance pay).  \n  8 \nthese relate to payments made in the last year. Due to the quarterly nature of the LFS, payment \nmethod information is effectively for the previous 13 weeks.  \n Both data sets allow the disaggregation of job separations into a number of categories, \nincluding quits, fires and redundancies. We observe job separations in the year following the \nobservation of pay type. For the BHPS we have a panel of separations of up to 8 years, whereas \nwith the structure of the LFS we effectively only observe one year of separation data on each \nindividual. \n Training information is quite detailed in the BHPS, and has been extensively used by \nresearchers in the past (see for instance Arulampalam and Booth (1998) and Booth and Bryan \n(2006)). We focus on the incidence of employer funded training, general training and specific \ntraining. The LFS contains less detailed information on training, and much of this is only \navailable for certain subsets of the data. However, unlike the BHPS, it has an explicit question on \nthe incidence of informal on-the-job training. We use this to examine the role of profit shares on \nhelping effort. \n Table 1 provides summary statistics for the two data sets. In the BHPS roughly 42 percent \nof our sample report receiving a \"profit share or bonus\" in the past year and 19 percent report \nsome form of performance pay. The more detailed pay scheme rates in the LFS appear somewhat \nlower; however recall that these are reported rates of payment in the past quarter. If these rates \nare roughly annualized, then profit share\/bonuses are received by approximately 39 percent of \nmale non-public sector employees. Whether the receipt of performance related pay is of a \ncomparable level is dependant on how respondents in the BHPS viewed payments classified as \ncompensatory wages and the other additional payments listed in the LFS. Otherwise the two \n  9 \nsamples appear roughly comparable, although there are slight variations by age and hours \nworked. Log weekly pay rates are noticeably lower in the LFS.  \n \n3.1 EMPIRICAL APPROACH \n Our basic approach starts from past work by focusing on job separation over a future \nperiod (we test several alternative period lengths).  The probability of a separation is a function of \nreceiving profit sharing in the current period.  Training is measured in the current period and also \ndependent on receiving profit sharing in the current period.  We begin by reproducing findings \nfor the UK similar to those of Azfar and Danninger (2001) for the US.  Yet, we explicitly test for \nthe indirect effect that they and Gielen (2007) only assume.  Ultimately, future separation is \nestimated as a function of current profit sharing and, simultaneously, training is estimated as a \nfunction of both current profit sharing and future separation. \nThe recursive bivariate probit appropriate for this latter test belongs to the general class of \nmultiple equation models with both continuous and discrete endogenous variables introduced by \nHeckman (1978). Following from this literature there exists a reduced form equation for \nseparation as the potentially endogenous dummy and second structural form equation estimating \nthe determinants of training: \n \n                           iii xBy 11\n'\n1\n*\n1 \u00b5+=  \n                    iiisiii zyxBy 22\n'\n2112\n'\n2\n*\n2 \u00b5\u03b4\u03b4\u00b5 ++=+=                                                         (1) \n \nwhere *1iy  and \n*\n2iy  are latent variables for separation and training provision with iy1  and iy2  \ndichotomous variables observed according to the rule: \n \n  10 \n                         0=jiy  if 0\n* >jiy  and 1=jiy  if 0\n* \u2264jiy  for j = 1,2                                     (2) \nHere ix1 and iz2 are vectors of exogenous variables and the error terms ( ii 21 , \u00b5\u00b5 ) are distributed \nbivariate normal with correlation coefficient \u03c1 .  Estimates of, and inference on, the parameters \n( '1B , 1\u03b4 , '2\u03b4 , \u03c1 ) follow from the maximum likelihood method and the relevant log-likelihood \n(Maddala, 1983: 123).  The likelihood ratio test (LR) provides the most suitable test for the \nexogeneity of iy1  (Monfardini and Radice 2008): \n \n                                            0: =\u03c1oH   vs.  0: \u2260\u03c1aH                                                        (3) \n \nUnder the null hypothesis the log-likelihood of the model becomes the sum of the log-likelihood \nfunctions of the two univariate probits estimated separately.  Under the alternative hypothesis, \nsimultaneous estimation is required and the resulting log-likelihood is compared to the sum under \nthe null to conduct the test. \n Despite the recursive structure, Wilde (2000) shows that identification can often be \nachieved by the non-linearity even if the exogenous variables are identical in both equations.  \nNonetheless, Monfardini and Radice (2008) show that adding a suitable instrument to the first \nequation remains critical in applied work as it preserves the validity of the LR exogeneity test \nwhen the distribution of errors is non-normal as can often be expected. As a consequence, we \nfollow the instrumental variable estimation of (1).  We discuss the instrument when we introduce \nour estimates in section 5. \n Recognize that profit sharing is a critical element of both ix1  and iz2 .  Direct causation \nwould be supported by a significant coefficient on profit sharing in '2\u03b4  after correctly accounting \nfor any potential endogeneity of the separation probability. Indirect causation would be supported \n  11 \nby a significant coefficient on profit sharing in '1B  combined with a significant 1\u03b4 coefficient \nagain after accounting for any potential endogeneity.  Thus, the evidence in favor of the indirect \ncausation that has been suggested in the literature depends critically on the multiple equation \nestimation that we are the first to undertake. \n \n4. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE: PROFIT SHARING, TRAINING AND SEPARATION \nProbit estimates of the risk of job separation are reported in Table 2 for the BHPS and LFS, \nrespectively. For ease of interpretation we report marginal effects. We present overall estimates \nof separation and have also estimated models disaggregated by quits, fires and redundancies (a \nsubset of fires). Initially, risk of separation is estimated with standard errors clustered at the \nindividual level. Both data sets present clear evidence that the receipt of profit sharing is \nassociated with a lower risk of separation.4 Such systematic effects are not observed for other \nperformance pay types. \nINSERT TABLE 2 \n \nTable 3 provides preliminary evidence on the relationship between profit shares and \ntraining. It reports probit estimates of the impact of profit sharing on training incidence with \nstandard errors clustered at the individual level. The estimates are reported for overall training \nincidence, along with the incidence of employer funded training, general training and specific \ntraining.5 Such a detailed level of disaggregation is not possible in the LFS. Instead, for the LFS \nwe report estimates of the influence of payment method on overall training incidence and on the \n                                                 \n4\n Furthermore, in unreported results we find that profit sharing is associated with both lower incidence of employee \ninitiated separations (quits) and employer initiated separations (fires). \n5\n In unreported estimates, the effect of profit shares on training intensity (days of training) largely follow the patterns \nof sign and significance reported in table 4. These estimates are available from the authors. \n  12 \nincidence of on-the-job training.  All control variables are as reported in table 2, but for brevity \nonly the estimated payment method effects are reported.  \n These estimates demonstrate that the receipt of profit sharing stands as a positive \ndeterminant of the incidence of training.  The estimates for the disaggregated training incidence \nmodels also suggest a positive association between profit share receipt and the receipt of \nemployer-funded training, specific training and general training. The magnitudes of these effects \nare roughly similar. Furthermore, evidence from the LFS indicates that profit sharing is positively \nassociated with a higher incidence of informal on-the-job training, an effect that is not evident for \nperformance pay. When combined with our inability to find a role for reduced separation \nprobability on training (see section 5), this finding is consistent with the notion that profit sharing \nincreases helping effort and so directly increases training within the workplace. \n \n     INSERT TABLE 4 \n \n It has been suggested that any observed relationship between profit shares and job \nseparation may simply reflect the sorting of individuals by unobservable characteristics.  Thus \nKruse (1991) has suggested that profit sharing may be associated with firms and workers who \nvalue employment stability.  As one illustration, workers who form strong bonds with co-workers \nmay both sort into workplaces using profit sharing and be less likely to quit (Heywood et al. \n2005). To investigate this and related possibilities, we re-estimate the models of overall \nseparations for the BHPS where we utilize a fixed effects logit estimator in an attempt to control \nfor unobserved individual level heterogeneity.6 The results from this model are reported in \n                                                 \n6Two related problems emerge because the fixed effects logit estimator excludes observations with no variation in \nthe dependent variable. First, the smaller sample size makes it difficult to gain efficient fixed effects estimates for the \nseparation sub-categories.  Second, the resulting sample may not be fully representative. We note that alternative \nfixed effects linear probability models yield profit share effects very similar in magnitude and significance to those \n  13 \ncolumn 1 of table 4. This demonstrates that the sign and significance of profit sharing effects on \nseparations are robust to the inclusion of individual level fixed effects.   \nAgain, the estimated association between training and profit shares may merely signal \nthat individuals who have higher unobservable propensity to train may sort into workplaces with \nprofit sharing arrangements. We investigate this by again controlling for individual specific \nunobservable characteristics by re-estimating the model of overall training incidence via fixed \neffects logit.7 These estimates are reported in the remaining columns of table 4. These retain the \nsame signs and general significance as those reported in table 3, although the effect of profit \nsharing on overall training incidence just misses significance at the 10 per cent level.   \n \n5. SEPARATING DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS  \nThe estimates above, as in previous studies, demonstrate a relationship between profit sharing \nand training, along with an association between profit sharing and separation. In this section we \nseek to provide evidence on the relative importance of the two channels suggested in the \nliterature: the indirect relationship that works through the channel of profit sharing reducing \nseparation and so making a larger share of training investments profitable and a direct effect of \nalleviating the hold-up problem in training and\/or increasing the willingness of coworkers to \nprovide training.    \nOur primary method is to estimate the recursive bivariate probit model described in \nSection 3. The essence of this estimation is that profit sharing enters as a determinant of \nseparation risk and that both separation risk and profit sharing enter as determinants of receiving \n                                                                                                                                                              \nreported in table 3. These estimates, and fixed effects logit estimates for the separation sub-categories, are available \nfrom the authors upon request. \n7\n Again this strategy may introduce sample selection bias into our estimates. We re-estimated all the models reported \nin table 6 by linear probability model with fixed effects. This produced similar estimates of the effect of profit \nsharing\/bonuses and performance pay on the incidence of training. \n  14 \ntraining. As described, for such estimates to be robust, the reduced form estimate of separation \nrisk should include an instrument that influences separation risk but is not a determinant of \ntraining. \n Our identification strategy exploits a long recognized association between cigarette \nsmoking and risk preference. Thus, Hersch and Viscusi (1990) and Hersch and Pickton (1995) \nuse cigarette smoking to identify individuals with greater risk preference.  Experiments on risk \naversion confirm that those who undertake larger risks in the laboratory are significantly more \nlikely to smoke (Barsky et al 1997).  Moreover, cigarette smoking has been correlated with \nimportant labor market choices.  Viscusi and Hersch (2001) demonstrate that US workers who \nsmoke take substantially more risky jobs (in terms of injuries on the jobs).  In the UK Brown et \nal. (2006) show that smokers are more likely to accept jobs with greater earnings and \nemployment risk.  The critical point from this literature is that smokers can be expected to receive \nless disutility from a given risk of job separation.  As a consequence, in a hedonic labor market, \nwe anticipate that workers that smoke will sort into jobs with higher expected separation risks. \n At the same time that identification requires a variable that strongly determines a workers \nseparation risk, that same variable should not influence the incidence of training itself.  While \nsome forms of training may be more risky than others, there is nothing about the association \nbetween smoking and risk that we think should influence the decision whether or not to \nundertake training itself.  Alternatively, it might be argued that cigarette smokers will avoid \ntraining because of higher discount rates but the average length of training is sufficiently short \nthat this is unlikely to be a crucial factor. Statistically, how many cigarettes an individual smokes \nper day appears unrelated to any of the measures of training incidence (an average absolute value \nT-Stat of 0.638) but it emerges as a strong determinant of separation risk. Moreover, a linear \n  15 \nversion of the model yields test statistics that are above the critical values outlined by Stock and \nYogo (2005) to detect weak instruments (F-Test = 10.571).  \nINSERT TABLE 6 \n \nEstimates of the recursive bivariate models of separation and training are reported in \nTable 6. These estimates use separation in the next year and show that the number of cigarettes is \na strong positive determinant of the likelihood of separation. Yet, the addition of this variable \ndoes not change the important role that profit sharing plays as a direct negative determinant of the \nprobability of job separation. The indirect effect would receive support if separation now \ninfluences training.  It takes a routinely negative coefficient and that it emerges as significant in \nboth the overall training and the general training estimates. This tends to support the notion in the \nliterature that it is the ability of profit sharing to reduce separations that changes amortization \nperiods and increases the profitability of training.  Nonetheless, we emphasize that the direct \neffect of profit sharing remains. In three of the four specifications, profit sharing takes a positive \nand significant coefficient in the direct estimation even given the recursive structure.  Moreover, \nin the insignificant specific training estimate, the summary specification statistics indicate that \nthere is no gain to the recursive structure suggesting the positive coefficient on profit sharing \nfrom the single equation specification may be most appropriate.  \nThe results present an important contrast from the single equation estimates we present \nand that have been presented in the literature.  Profit sharing remains a negative determinant of \nseparation and profit sharing remains a positive determinant of training.  Yet, the jointly \nestimated results present the first support specifically in favor of the indirect causation that has \nbeen highlighted by previous researchers.  Nonetheless, the results remain highly supportive of a \ndirect effect such as reducing hold-up problems or encouraging co-worker provision.  Certainly \n  16 \nthe fact that other types of performance pay are associated with greater training even as they have \nno influence on separation hints of the potential importance of the hold-up problem. \n \n5.1 ROBUSTNESS CHECKS \nIt might be argued that estimating the impact of separation in the year following training \nis arbitrary. Indeed, it might be argued that if the period of amortization is the issue, the time \nframe should be longer. We estimated models using separation within the next 2 years and show \nthe results in Table 6. Much of the pattern remains. First, the instrument continues to play a \nimportant role and pass the usual tests to reject weakness.  Second, profit sharing continues to \nreduce the likelihood of separation.  Third, profit sharing continues to be a strong and statistically \nsignificant direct determinant of training.  Indeed, this is confirmed in all four estimates.  Fourth, \ndespite these similarities there is no longer confirmation of any indirect influence of profit \nsharing.  While profit sharing reduces separation, the role of separation on training is routinely \nvery far from statistical significance. Thus, our evidence of an indirect effect appears highly \nsensitive to both the measure of training (general vs. specific) and the use of one year period in \nwhich to measure separation.  Extending the time period to separation over the next 3 years yields \na pattern virtually identical to that in Table 6 with no support for the indirect effect. \nIt might be thought that our estimation is missing the critical role played by separation \nbecause of the range of tenures in our sample.  Specifically, most separations may happen early \nin a workers' tenure and it is also at this time that most training is undertaken (Greenhalgh and \nMarvotas 1996).  Thus, our estimations might fail to uncover the true negative influence of the \nseparation probability on training that happens throughout most of a worker's later tenure.  In \nunreported tests we re-estimated our models in Table 5 eliminating all workers within their first \n  17 \ntwo years of tenure.  While the point estimates move modestly, the direct effect of profit sharing \nremains strongly confirmed and there is no significant role for the estimated separation \nprobability.  \n Separation may represent too coarse a separation variable. Instead risk of employer \ninitiated separations (fires) may be more likely to effect employers\u2019 decisions on who to train \n(especially in firm specific skills). We re-estimated the models in Table 5 using fires instead of \nseparations, again the point estimates of profit shares on training remain essentially unchanged. \nThird, it might be asked how the recursive IV performs on the LFS data with its somewhat \ndifferent definitions of the critical variables.  While there is no evidence on smoking, we \nestimated an analogous specification using homeownership as an IV determinant of separation.  \nDespite the statistical success of the IV in determining separation but not training, there was \nevidence only of a direct effect for profit sharing. \n Our results could be biased if profit sharing jobs are better quality job matches in some \nunobserved dimension. In this case profit share merely flags jobs that are likely to have lower \nseparation and higher training for other reasons.  Profit sharing could then be endogenous and the \nbias not removed by simple fixed effects.  As a test of this possibility, we estimated a trivariate \nversion of the models presented in Table 5. The additional equation is a profit sharing incidence \nmodel (probit) where the regressors are those from Table 2 (excluding profit sharing of course). \nWe instrument this equation using year dummies which are subsequently omitted from the \ntraining and separation equations. While not strongly based on theory, these pass key instrument \nvalidity tests of overidentification and exclusion validity. This trivariate estimation does not \nmaterially affect the sign and significance of the profit sharing coefficients estimated in either the \n  18 \nseparation and training equations. This provides some reassurance that the observed effects of \nprofit sharing reflect more than variations in unobserved job match quality.  \n \n6. CONCLUSION \nThis paper investigated one particular channel by which profit sharing may influence \nproductivity, the effect of profit sharing on worker training. In particular, we distinguish between \nthe direct effect of profit sharing on training through creating a contract that rewards training \nand\/or encouraging co-workers to provide training, and the indirect effect through reduced \nseparations and hence longer expected amortization period.  \nAs a first step we use UK data to demonstrate that profit sharing is associated with lower \nseparation rates and with greater provision of worker training.  This is true of overall training \nincidence and intensity and also for sub-categories of training such as employer-funded, specific \nand general training. These results are robust to the inclusion of controls for individual fixed \neffects, simultaneity of training and separation, and remain once we attempt to control for the \neffect that profit sharing has on reducing the likelihood of future separation from the firm.   \nMore generally, these direct effects on training are also present for other performance \nrelated pay. However, unlike performance related pay schemes that directly reward individual \nproductivity, profit sharing may also increase informal and on-the-job training provision by co-\nworkers. We present evidence that profit sharing does indeed increase the provision of informal \non the job training, and that no such effect is present for other performance related pay.  \nOur attempts to identify an indirect effect of profit sharing reveal a mixed pattern. In two \nof the four types of training we can identify a significant indirect effect.  Profit sharing emerges \nas a negative determinant of separation and lower separation is associated with an increased \n  19 \nlikelihood of training.  This indirect influence did not prove robust to changes in the period over \nwhich separation was calculated or to several other alterations in specification. As a consequence, \nwe suggest that the influence of profit sharing on training is unlikely to operate primarily through \nits reduction on separations while simultaneously presenting the first, if only suggestive, evidence \nsupporting the theoretical prediction of an indirect causation \n  \n \n  20 \nTABLE 1 Summary Statistics, Male Non-Public Sector Employees Aged 20-65 \n BHPS 1998-2004 LFS 1999-2004 \nVariables Mean Std Dev Mean Std Dev \nProfit Sharing\/Bonuses 0.426    \nPerformance Pay 0.188    \nPiece Rate\/Tips   0.008  \nProfit Shares   0.015  \nBonuses   0.083  \nCompensatory Wages   0.075  \nOther Additional Payments   0.039  \nAge (years) 37.921 11.134 40.450 11.952 \nTenure (years) 11.540 7.433   \nTenure: 0-3 months      \n3-6 months   0.110  \n6-12 months   0.219  \n1 \u2013 2yrs   0.161  \n2 \u2013 5 yrs   0.219  \n5 \u2013 10 yrs   0.161  \n10 yrs +   0.341  \nMarried 0.581  0.640  \nHighest Level of Education:     \n< A-Level 0.526  0.511  \nA-Level 0.237  0.272  \nDiploma\/Vocational* 0.089  0.096  \nDegree 0.119  0.143  \nHigher Degree 0.029  -  \nLog Pay (\u00a31996) 6.482 1.026 5.506 0.636 \nNormal Hours Worked 40.040 6.923 42.980 12.354 \nUnion Member 0.219  0.259  \nTemporary Job 0.032  0.038  \nFirm Size: 1-24 workers     \n25-99 workers 0.256    \n100-499 workers 0.267    \n500 workers plus 0.161    \nObservations 14047  40269  \nSource: BHPS, LFS \n  21 \nTABLE 2 Estimates of the Probability of Separation (Marginal Effects), Male Non-Public Sector \nEmployees Aged 20-65. \n \n BHPS 1998-2004 LFS 1999-2004 \nProfit Share -0.041* [0.007] -0.028** [0.013] \nBonus  0.008 [0.005] \n Performance Pay 0.005 [0.008] 0.010 [0.015] \nCompensatory Pay  -0.009 [0.006] \nOther Bonus  0.008 [0.005] \nAge 0.001 [0.002] 0.001 [0.001 \n Age2 -0.0001 [0.00002] -0.00003* [0.00001] \nTenure (days) -0.005* [0.0004]  \nTenure: 3-6 months  -0.026* [0.007] \n6-12 months  -0.033* [0.006] \n1 \u2013 2yrs  -0.047* [0.006] \n2 \u2013 5 yrs  -0.075* [0.006] \n5 \u2013 10 yrs  -0.102* [0.006] \n10 yrs+  -0.139* [0.006] \nMarried -0.013 [0.008] 0.011* [0.003] \nA-Level  0.020** [0.009] 0.006*** [0.004] \nDiploma 0.030** [0.013] 0.010** [0.005] \nDegree or Higher 0.028** [0.011] -0.008*** [0.005] \nLog Weekly Wage -0.009** [0.004] -0.009* [0.003] \nNormal Hours 0.001** [0.0004] 0.0004* [0.0001] \nUnion -0.051* [0.009] -0.024* [0.004] \nTemporary Worker 0.165* [0.017] 0.050* [0.006] \nFirm Size 50-99 0.010 [0.009]  \nFirm Size 100 to 500 -0.013 [0.009]  \nFirm Size 500+ -0.001 [0.001]  \nConstant -0.132 -0.095 \nPseudo r2 0.053 0.075 \nObservations 14047 40269 \nSource: BHPS, LFS.
