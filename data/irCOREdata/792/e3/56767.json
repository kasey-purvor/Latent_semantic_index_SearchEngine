Little is known about\nthe views of general practitioners (GPs) towards reval-\nidation and appraisal although it is clear that these\nattitudes will influence local implementation and be\ncritical to the nature and success of this process.\nThis study set out to investigate the knowledge,\nattitudes and beliefs of GPs in Lincolnshire towards\nappraisal and revalidation and to explore possible\nfactors that may be barriers or facilitators of this\nprocess in primary care.\nMethod\nAll 343 GP principals on the medical list in Lincoln-\nshire were invited to complete a postal questionnaire\nbetween June and September 2000. Questionnaires\nwere sent out with a covering letter from clinical\ngovernance leaders of primary care organisations in the\ncounty. The questionnaire asked about personal attrib-\nutes of the respondents such as age, sex, hours worked,\nyears in practice and previous experience of appraisal or\nappraisal training. There were also open questions on\nthe personal and professional attributes that GPs would\nlook for in an appraiser and their concerns about an\nappraisal system. The main body of the questionnaire\nconsisted of items worded as attitudinal statements on\nissues relating to revalidation and appraisal. The\nstatements were identified from the literature and\ninformal interviews with GPs. These were tested and\nrefined on the basis of a small number of pilot\nquestionnaires. The final version consisted of 47\nattitudinal statements. A Likert-type format with five\nresponse codes ranging from 1 \u00bc strongly agree to\n5 \u00bc strongly disagree was used. For analysis purposes,\nthe strongly agree \u2044 agree and strongly disagree \u2044disagree\ncategories were combined, keeping the middle cate-\ngory of neutral. A reminder questionnaire was sent to\nnon-responders 6 weeks after the initial questionnaire.\nThe completed questionnaires were analysed using\nSPSSPC.10 Responses were compared using Spearman\u2019s\ncorrelation. The internal consistency of attitude state-\nments (after reversing the coding for positive state-\nments) was calculated using Cronbach\u2019s alpha.\nResults\nOf the 343 Lincolnshire GPs sent questionnaires, 272\n(79%) returned completed questionnaires after two\nmailings. Responders were similar to non-responders in\nterms of age and sex (Table 1). Cronbach\u2019s alpha was\n0\u00c678 for the 47 statements, indicating a high degree of\ninternal consistency between the responses to attitude\nstatements. General practitioners were more in favour\nof appraisal than revalidation but were not strongly in\nfavour of either process (Table 2).\nKey learning points\nAll GPs are expected to have an appraisal from\n2002 and the first cohort will experience revali-\ndation in 2005.\nAppraisal for GPs is to be locally implemented and\nfunded by primary care organisations according to\nnational standards.\nA better understanding of knowledge, beliefs and\nattitudes towards appraisal will help in setting up a\nsuccessful appraisal system for GPs.\nThis study highlights the belief that appraisal, as\nan educational tool, will help to foster positive\nattitudes towards these processes and will be\nwelcomed if it is locally owned and takes into\naccount GPs\u2019 views and concerns. Concerns,\nparticularly relating to lack of time and resources\nfor appraisal and revalidation, need to be\naddressed by primary care organisations.\nTable 1 Comparison of responders and

beliefs and concerns \u2022 J Middlemass & A N Siriwardena780\n\u0002 Blackwell Publishing Ltd MEDICAL EDUCATION 2003;37:778\u2013785\nPurpose of appraisal and revalidation\nOver three-quarters (77\u00c63%) of respondents thought\nthat the difference between appraisal and revalidation\nwas poorly understood. Most felt that revalidation was\npart of performance monitoring (81\u00c62%). Nearly two-\nthirds (59%) felt that the government had a hidden\nagenda, revealing suspicions about the motives for\nintroducing these processes. Over half the respondents\n(54\u00c63%) believed that the purpose of appraisal was\neducational. Most (94\u00c65%) believed that a variety of\nfactors could lead to poor performance within a\npractice, of which a poorly performing doctor was only\none.\nWhat evidence should be provided?\nOver half the respondents (58\u00c69%) agreed that their\npractice should be evaluated in terms of statements\ndetailed in Good Medical Practice,11 which outlines the\nduties and responsibilities of a family doctor. Most\nLincolnshire GPs were aware of this document (un-\npublished data). Over two-thirds stated that they would\nagree to provide evidence of their practice (67\u00c68%) and\nover half (54\u00c64%) understood that revalidation would\nrequire a portfolio of evidence. General practitioners\nthought that audit, evidence of training and practice\nobjectives were relevant data to be gathered for\nappraisal. Over two-thirds of GPs (70\u00c61%) agreed with\nstatements linking appraisal with continuing profes-\nsional development and over three-quarters (77\u00c69%)\nagreed that the GP appraisal should result in an agreed\ndevelopment plan. Less than half (44\u00c61%) of GPs in\nLincolnshire thought that revalidation was a confiden-\ntial process and approximately half (51\u00c63%) thought\nthat only the training needs identified from the apprai-\nsal should be disclosed to others.\nDeveloping revalidation and appraisal\nOnly a quarter of respondents (24\u00c68%) were in favour\nof relying on the Royal College of General Practition-\ners (RCGP) to come up with a revalidation tool. It is\nnot clear whether GPs questioned the motives of the\nRCGP, its competence or the appropriateness of it\ndevising such a tool. This leaves some doubt about\nthe College\u2019s accredited professional development\n(APD) as a route to revalidation. Most wanted the\nappraisal process to be developed locally. Over three-\nquarters (81\u00c62%) of GPs thought that they would be\nable to negotiate educational aims and objectives with\ntheir appraiser, but only a third (38\u00c67%) believed that\nthey would be able to negotiate the format of the\nappraisal. The majority of GPs (74\u00c62%) wanted their\nappraisal to be held in the practice; many (83\u00c66%) felt\nstrongly that it should take place during the working\nday and over half (59\u00c68%) did not want any patient\ntime to be lost by undertaking an appraisal. However,\nit was not clear whether this meant that they were\nwilling to alter surgery times or whether they wanted\nlocum cover.\nWho should be the appraiser?\nAlmost all respondents (91\u00c62%) wanted their appraiser\nto be a practising GP and most (69\u00c65%) felt that\nappraisal should be a peer review process. Half (51\u00c67%)\nwanted to be able to choose their appraiser. They sought\nan appraiser who was non-threatening, experienced,\nempathetic and sympathetic, and one who commanded\nTable 2 Continued\nStatement\nNumber (%) of 272 GPs responding\nAgree or\nstrongly agree Neutral\nDisagree or\nstrongly\ndisagree\nMissing\ndata\nNo. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%)\nTraining and resources for appraisal\nThere should be training for all GPs undertaking appraisal\nwhether as an appraisee or appraiser\n234 (86\u00c60) 31 (11\u00c64) 7 (2\u00c66) 0 (0)\nCurrently there is a lack of trained GPs able to appraisers 223 (82\u00c60) 46 (16\u00c69) 3 (1\u00c61) 0 (0)\nThere are sufficient resources to support appraisal training 16 (5\u00c69) 20 (7\u00c64) 236 (86\u00c68) 0 (0)\nGP trainers should be exempt from appraisals 18 (6\u00c66) 11 (4\u00c60) 243 (89\u00c63) 0 (0)\nGeneral practitioners, revalidation and appraisal: a survey of attitudes, beliefs and concerns \u2022 J Middlemass & A N Siriwardena 781\n\u0002 Blackwell Publishing Ltd MEDICAL EDUCATION 2003;37:778\u2013785\nthe confidence and respect of fellow professionals. They\nalso wanted appraisers to have experience as trainers or\nteachers. Although some wanted appraisers to have\nadditional qualifications, they were less in favour of\nacademics as appraisers. Only a quarter of respondents\nhad someone in mind as their appraiser.\nTraining\nThe vast majority of GPs (86\u00c65%) wanted all GPs to be\ntrained to engage in the appraisal process. Most (82%)\nalso agreed that there was a lack of trained appraisers, a\nbelief which was borne out by low rates of self-reporting\nof training for both appraisers and appraisees. While\n11\u00c68% of GPs had undergone appraiser training, fewer\n(7\u00c61%) had had appraisee training. Most GPs (86\u00c68%)\nwere unconvinced that there would be sufficient\nresources to support appraisal training.\nConcerns\nResponses to the open question revealed that time\ninvolved in the appraisal process and lack of resources\nwere major concerns (Table 3). General practitioners\nwere suspicious that there was an element of manipu-\nlation by government in the process. They were worried\nthat the process would be stressful and threatening and\nwere concerned about who their appraisers would be.\nThere were also concerns that the system itself was too\nrigid and would serve to demoralise good GPs rather\nthan to weed out poorly performing GPs.\nFactors correlating with a positive attitude\nto appraisal\nThose in favour of appraisal tended to have had previous\nexperience of appraisal as an educational tool (Table 4).\nThese GPs were also more likely to perceive a degree of\ncontrol over the process, in that they could, for example,\nnegotiate aims and objectives. They expected a devel-\nopment plan to be a product of their appraisal and were\ncomfortable with setting objectives and being account-\nable for these at their next appraisal. Those who were in\nfavour of appraisals believed there should be appraisal\ntraining for all GPs. Those in favour of appraisals\ndisagreed that there was a lack of commitment on the\npart of GPs to the process of appraisals. There was also a\ncorrelation between positive attitudes to appraisal\namongst those who had received appraiser training, for\nexample those who were GP trainers.\nGeneral practitioners in favour of appraisal also had\npositive views on revalidation. They were less likely to\nsuspect a hidden agenda on the part of government.\nThey felt that revalidation would provide evidence that\nacceptable care was being provided to patients. They\nwere also more likely to agree that having an appraisal\nformed part of the revalidation process. There was a\nweak correlation with age, with older GPs slightly more\nin favour of appraisal.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this survey provide some insight into the\nviews of GPs towards appraisal and revalidation just\nbefore their introduction. Although there is now greater\nknowledge about when and how these processes will be\nundertaken, the emphasis on local implementation for\nappraisal and lack of information about revalidation\nmeans that considerable uncertainty remains.\nThe high response rate may have been due to the fact\nthat appraisal and revalidation are areas of concern to\nGPs. The high overall response rate, good response\nto individual survey items and spread of responses to\nattitudinal statements supported the face and content\nvalidity of the questionnaire. The high internal consis-\ntency suggested that the instrument was reliable. The\nfindings are particularly of interest to Lincolnshire GPs.\nHowever, there is no reason to suspect that the\nattitudes of Lincolnshire GPs should differ from those\nof GPs in other areas of the country. General practi-\ntioner non-principals were not considered in this\nsurvey, and further research to take in the views of this\ngrowing minority of professionals may be warranted.\nAn area of tension, which was borne out by this\nstudy, involved the conflict between the formative\nnature of the educational appraisal that aims to support\nand motivate doctors with the performance monitoring\nfunction of revalidation. There was real concern that\nappraisal might not detect incompetent doctors, but\nthat it could demoralise good ones. There was also\nawareness that a number of factors, such as health\nproblems, domestic circumstances and family break-\ndown12 might lead to a poor performance within\npractice. General practitioners wanted their appraiser\nto be a practising GP and appraisal to be a peer review\nprocess. This supports arguments for peer appraisal as\npeers are likely to have a more comprehensive view of\nthe appraisee\u2019s job performance,13 although there is\nalso a view that peer appraisal might be seen as\n\u0002grassing\u0003 on colleagues. Personal characteristics of an\nappraiser were seen as important in this survey. Riley14\nsuggested that a successful appraiser should have\nexcellent interpersonal skills, relate to and empathise\nwith the appraisee, but be able to give feedback in a\ndiplomatic, non-judgemental way, giving support and\ncounselling when necessary. ScHARR9 envisaged that\nGeneral practitioners, revalidation and appraisal: a survey of attitudes, beliefs and concerns \u2022 J Middlemass & A N Siriwardena782\n\u0002 Blackwell Publishing Ltd MEDICAL EDUCATION 2003;37:778\u2013785\nthere should be a core group of appraisers from which\nGPs could choose.\nConfidentiality was also of concern to practition-\ners. SCOPME15 stated that confidentiality should be\nrespected in appraisals. Oxley16 envisaged that the only\nexception to this would be if the appraisee\u2019s clinical\nwork was endangering patients but acknowledged that\nit was unlikely that appraisal would be the only source\nof this information. ScHARR9 considered that serious\nunderperformance should be dealt with separately from\nappraisal but there has been little consideration of what\nshould happen when a practitioner is found to be\nseriously underperforming. This survey looks at atti-\ntudes from the perspective of practitioners undergoing\nappraisal but other stakeholders are also likely to have\nimportant roles. The role of clinical governance leaders,\nthe functions of the deanery or issues around provision\nand resourcing of remedial training have not been\nclarified. Concerns over indemnity for appraisers,\nwhen, for example, an appraisal is satisfactory but the\npractitioner is later found to be seriously underper-\nforming, have yet to be addressed.\nThe evidence required for appraisal continues to be a\nmatter for debate. Although audits were seen as key\nelements for appraisal in this study, these often reflect\nthe care provided by the practice team as a whole rather\nthan that provided by an individual member. Practice\naims and objectives would not indicate individual\nTable 3 Main concerns about appraisal system for GPs: number\nof responses\nMain concerns about appraisal system for GPs\nNumber of\nresponses\n1 Time involved 73\n2 Lack of resources 44\n3 Government agenda, control \u2044manipulation,\njumping through hoops, OFSTED for doctors\n39\n4 Process stressful \u2044 threatening 23\n5 Anxiety about who the appraiser would be 21\n6 That the criteria wouldn\u2019t measure what it\nwas supposed to \u2013 too rigid \u2044 prescriptive,\nno flexibility\n19\n7 Lack of appraisal training 17\n8 Lack of confidentiality 15\n9 Loss of individuality, independence 7\n10 That it won\u2019t weed out poorly performing\ndoctors, but demoralise good ones\n5\nTable 4 Characteristics of GPs in favour of appraisal\nGPs who are in favour of appraisal are also more likely to:\nSpearman\u2019s rank correlation\ncoefficient (two-tailed)\nThink that the purpose of appraisal is educational rs \u00bc 0\u00c6287 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 000)\nAgree that appraisal should result in an agreed development plan rs \u00bc 0\u00c6228 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 000)\nAgree that appraisal covers areas such as educational, personal and\nprofessional development\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6186 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6002)\nAlso be in favour of revalidation rs \u00bc 0\u00c6684 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6000)\nBe comfortable in having agreed objectives set and being\naccountable for these at the next appraisal\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6218 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6000)\nAgree there should be appraisal training for all GPs rs \u00bc 0\u00c6129 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6034)\nHave had training as an appraiser rs \u00bc 0\u00c6122 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6047)\nHave had previous involvement as an appraiser rs \u00bc 0\u00c6251 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6000)\nHave had previous involvement as an appraisee rs \u00bc 0\u00c6187 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6002)\nThink that they are able to negotiate the terms and contents of their\neducational appraisal with their appraiser\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6142 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6020)\nThink that they are able to negotiate the aims and objectives of their\neducational appraisal with their appraiser\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6135 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6028)\nBelieve that appraisal is based on self-assessment by the appraisee\nwith appraiser facilitation\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6134 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6029)\nAgree that that the clinical governance lead would be a good\nchoice as appraiser\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6167 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6006)\nDisagree that no patient time should be lost undertaking an appraisal rs \u00bc \u2013 0\u00c6139 P < 0\u00c605 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6022)\nThink that having an appraisal forms part of the revalidation process rs \u00bc 0\u00c6310 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6000)\nAgree that revalidation monitors GPs performance against agreed\nstandards and targets\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6159 P < 0\u00c601 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6009)\nAgree that revalidation would provide evidence of acceptable care\nbeing provided to patients in order to continue practising\nrs \u00bc 0\u00c6263 P < 0\u00c601(P \u00bc 0\u00c6000)\nBe in the older age range rs \u00bc 0\u00c6132 P < 0\u00c65 (P \u00bc 0\u00c6032)\nGeneral practitioners, revalidation and appraisal: a survey of attitudes, beliefs and concerns \u2022 J Middlemass & A N Siriwardena 783\n\u0002 Blackwell Publishing Ltd MEDICAL EDUCATION 2003;37:778\u2013785\nperformance either. A portfolio of training would yield\na record of individual training undertaken but may not\nshow what the individual had gained from the training\nexperience unless this was recorded. Weightman12\ndetails record cards, complaints, mistakes, comparison\nwith other people\u2019s work, information from colleagues\nas well as personal files, sickness and absence records as\ninformation that could be obtained for appraisal. Peer\nrating using 360-degree surveys17 are starting to be\nused in some areas. The personal learning plan, a form\nof learning contract or agreement, will be one outcome\nof appraisal and will be reviewed regularly as part of\nsubsequent appraisals.\nThe advantage of effective educational appraisal is\nthat it can provide support, mentorship, recognition\nand the challenges required to motivate GPs,18 as well\nas enable them to reflect on performance in order to\naddress personal and service needs for learning.19 It is\nenvisaged that a personal learning plan will be negoti-\nated, agreed and signed by both appraiser and appraisee\nand that the whole plan or the learning needs arising\nfrom it could be shared within the organisation,14\nalthough the link with continuing professional devel-\nopment has yet to be operationalised.\nTraining will be a key issue both for appraisers and\nappraisees. Training in appraisal skills is important, not\nonly at inception, but also as the appraisal scheme\ncontinues in order to check on and refresh people\u2019s\nskills. Without appropriate training and careful devel-\nopment, a scheme could easily degenerate into a paper\nexercise. Training also has resource implications.20\nPotential problems will occur if a practitioner has a\nsatisfactory appraisal but is subsequently found to be\npoorly performing.\nAppropriate resourcing was a major concern for\nparticipants in this study and will be key to the success\nof the appraisal system. Although initial appraiser\ntraining will be funded centrally, this accounts for a\nvery small proportion of the overall costs. There will\nalso be costs for the remaining appraiser training and\nfor appraisee training for all GPs. Adequate resources\nare needed for preparation, undertaking the appraisal\nand recording the process. The time involved has been\nestimated at between 4\u00c65 and 6\u00c65 hours. Primary care\norganisations will need to have policies on the provision\nand funding of locum cover.17 There will be additional\ncosts for managing and co-ordinating the appraisal\nsystem. Outcomes from appraisals, such as identified\neducational needs, may also have resource implica-\ntions. Although funding for appraisal has been alloca-\nted to primary care trusts (PCTs) as part of their\nunified budgets, this is unlikely to fully meet the full\ncosts of the appraisal system. Given the other demands\non budgets and opportunity costs, this is likely to lead\nto potential tensions between GPs and primary care\norganisations.\nConclusion\nA better understanding of knowledge, beliefs and\nattitudes towards appraisal will ultimately help in\nsetting up a successful appraisal system for GPs. The\nmain challenge for the introduction of appraisal is to\nbuild on positive attitudes and allay fears. Clarifying the\nterminology to make appraisal explicitly educational\nwill be helpful in allaying fears and the Department of\nHealth has already gone some way along this path.\nThere also needs to be \u0002clear, blue water\u0003 between\nappraisal and revalidation in practitioners\u2019 minds to\navoid confusion between the purpose, methods and\noutcomes of these processes. Any system should also\nconsider the process of the appraisals and look at issues\nsuch as confidentiality to ensure that GPs\u2019 concerns are\naddressed as far as possible. This could be done by\nworking with opinion leaders, emphasising that apprai-\nsal will have a positive educational outcome and\nensuring that practitioners have a degree of ownership\nin the process. Urgent consideration of the financial\nand resource implications to undertake appraisals is\nneeded.\nContributors\nJM and ANS had the initial idea for the study.
