It starts \nwith a summary of the challenges and benefits of the adoption of PSS, and a \nsummary of available design methodologies for PSS.  Special characteristics of \nthe health care market are then discussed. Finally, a health care case study is \npresented, centring on convection-enhanced delivery of therapeutic agents. \n1.1. Challenges and Benefits of Implementing Product \nService Systems \nDespite the great potential of PSS and several very successful implementations in \nthe industrial sector, there is still a certain resistance for a broader adoption of the \nconcept [1, 2]. Putting PSS into practise requires a completely new mindset for \nboth the company providing the PSS and the customer using the offered PSS [3]. \nA company developing a PSS needs to be ready to adopt the concept [4]. This \nadoption may include changes in organization and a significant investment of \nmoney and time [1]. Companies which have implemented a matrix organization \nare more like to adopt and successfully implement PSS [2].  \nThree major functions within a company face major impacts if the decision is \nmade to offer PSS to a customer rather than simply a tangible product.  \nFirstly, the research and development (R&D) function has to gain the resources \nand the knowledge to be able to offer value adding services in combination with a \nproduct. R&D is also required to obtain the technical knowledge regarding the \nproduct and its constant quality improvement [5].  \nIn addition, R&D efforts are not complete after the product launch. PSS providers \nincrease their responsibility over the whole life cycle of a product, from \ndevelopment, through its use, including constant improvement, to the step of \ndiscarding and recycling. This influences development priorities. Ideally it moves \ndesigners towards a greater focus on developing more durable and recyclable \nproducts, as they may also be re-used in a PSS for other customers, or be \nreconfigured or updated by varying the services associated with the product [6]. \nSecondly, as the relationship between customers and the company changes \ndramatically with the implementation of PSS, a company\u2019s marketing group is \nlikely to be faced with process redesign [5].   \n3 \nAs PSS are inherently streamlining efforts towards the fulfilment of the final use \nfor the customer, a different approach is necessary to collect requirements. In \ntraditional product design, the design input consists of requirements for the \nproduct as evaluated by the marketing function. Instead of collecting this \ninformation, marketing needs to gather detailed knowledge about the final use for \nthe customer, considering that customers may be more keen on paying for the use \nor the result, rather than for the operation of a product or the ownership of the \nproduct itself [7]. \nThis approach requires a new mindset of the actors within and outside of a \ncompany. In order to collect the right data to constantly improve the PSS, the \norganization and communication infrastructure has to be set up to facilitate \nexchange between actors during the development phase and also during the \nperformance phase of the product [2, 4]. \nThis is the most crucial part for a positive adoption of the offering. In order to \noptimize and customize the PSS, users have to be involved early in the \ndevelopment phase to ensure the correct definition of the needs [4].  \nThirdly, human capital gains importance when a producing manufacturer is \nenhancing products by integrating service components. Consequently human \nresource development is the third major function within a PSS providing company \nthat is heavily affected [4].   \nFor companies, PSS clearly can set the basis of improved design and quality as \nwell as continuous innovation, which can be the strategic approach towards cost-\npressure and increased competition in a global market [3].  \nPSS allows adding value to a product that may be hard for competitors to imitate. \nEspecially in mature markets, adding value often is the only way to secure and \nfurther improve the market position of a company. Successfully implementing \nthese changes, however, is not a guarantee of success with PSS. Besides the \nreadiness of the company, customers need to be ready to accept such a concept \n[4]. Cultural or social barriers to the implementation of a PSS may exist.  For \nexample, end users may not feel comfortable with their lack of ownership of the \ntangible product, which they require to fulfil their needs. In order for customers to \nprovide the required input for designing and enhancing PSS, processes training of \nthose customers would almost certainly be required [4]. However, willingness to \n4 \naccept such training implies that the customer requires an initial level of \nacceptance of the concept.  \nHowever there can also be clear advantages for the customer. Customers take \nadvantage of better design and quality. Customized products may lead to higher \ndegree of satisfaction with regards to their final needs. The changed ownership \nstructures can also be counted as another benefit for the user. Despite some \nresistance to this concept, customers in general profit form paying for the use or - \neven more advantageous - the result. This takes away all responsibilities in terms \nof operation, availability, maintenance, insurance and recycling from the customer \n[4]. \n1.2. Designing Product Service Systems \nThe focus of a PSS on the final use for the customer, rather than the requirements \nof a product suitable to be used to fulfil such final use, change the development \nprocesses away from those used for traditional product development \nTan et al. [7] analyzed the status of research with regards to development \nmethodologies for PSS and identified a research gap for such methodologies.  \nIn the absence of dedicated design methodologies, most methods for designing \nPSS are derived from traditional product development. Instead of approaching the \ndesign of PSS with a \u201cgreen-field mindset\u201d [3] often industry tends to design \nsystems using current practise in product design. This inherent limitation may be \nthe reason for the restricted adoption of PSS in industry.[2].  \nPSS is adding complexity in terms of design. In fact it is adding new dimensions \nto the development process [6], since it is not sufficient to solve a problem \ndefined by some design input requirements. In addition to this technological \naspect, one needs to take in account the social as well as the cultural component. \nAn understanding of the mindset of involved actors (such as users, and providers) \nis crucial to the design of a sophisticated PSS.  \nConsidering this complexity, PSS designers require methodologies and tools to \nvisualize the network of actors and their needs. The same is true for the graphical \nrepresentation of immaterial components versus tangible products. Such \nvisualisation allows to better understand relations and to manage the different \nphases of design.  \n5 \nPSS are complex systems having implications in technology, human resources, \nmarketing, customer relations and communication, so it appears reasonable to \nderive a design methodology for PSS from involved disciplines, such as social \nstudies, marketing, management, engineering and information science [6]. \nNevertheless, those methodologies are not taking in account all aspects of PSS \nand may form a barrier for further innovation.  \nBy analysing case studies, Morelli [6] proposed a generic design process in seven \nsteps (see Table 1): \nTable 1: Generic PSS design process proposed by Morelli   \nDesign step Description \nDefinition of value proposition Definition of the final needs of the end user \nMarket analysis  Outline of the market players and the network between those players \nProduct\/Service definition Definition of the architecture and functionalities of the system \nUse-case analysis  Analysis of several conditions of use to define functions, requirements \nand priorities  \nTentative architecture PSS prototype development  \nTest PSS prototype testing \nFinal definition  Refinement of the tentative architecture based on test results \n \nWithin each of these steps for PSS design, more specific tools could then be \napplied to generate a best outcome.     \n2 The Health Care Market \n2.1. Special Characteristics of the Health Care Market \nMore than any other market the health care sector is regulated.  This regulation is \ndefined by governmental authorities but also by the industry itself, to mitigate the \nhigh risks often associated with development of drugs or medical devices.    \nConsidering the actors within this market, different layers of can be identified. \nThese are summarised in Figure 1. Firstly, there are \u201cframework defining\u201d \ninstitutions, such as regulatory authorities and governmental, as well as private, \nhealth insurance companies.  \nThe layer of \u201ctechnology providing\u201d companies consists of pharmaceutical \ncompanies as well as software and hardware providers. Those companies provide \nproducts, services and combinations thereof to different users. Due to the \nspecialization in medical health care, those users most likely will consist of \n6 \nspecialized physicians along the diagnostic and therapeutic workflow (e.g. \nradiologists for diagnosis, medical oncologists, radiotherapists and surgeons for \ntreatment of cancer). The patients as \u201cend user\u201d form the basic layer of actors in \nthe market, creating the actual need for a specific diagnostic or therapeutic \nprocedure.  \nFigure 1: Actors in the health care market \n \n \nConsidering the potentially high risks, regulatory bodies require a proof of safety \nand efficacy to be documented by the approval-requesting company in order to \napprove the marketing of drugs, medial devices or services. Compliance to all \napplicable regulatory standards is mandatory for any provider of products or \nservices to enter the market\n1\n.  \nGovernmental regulatory authorities like the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) in the United States influence development costs for drugs, medical \ndevices or services by setting the standards, requirements and restrictions for \nR&D. Governmental authorities can also shift the focus of R&D within \ncompanies by special regulations, An example of this is an accelerated approval \nprocess for technology to treat \u201corphan diseases\u201d (e.g. rare diseases with small \n                                                 \n1 http:\/\/www.fda.gov\/cdrh\/ \n7 \npatient population) , if the unmet medical need is higher than the incentive of the \nmarket [8]. Therefore, governmental policies clearly influence the market and its \nplayers in the health care sector.  \nInsurance programs and companies play another major role in defining the \nframework of the market. Governmental health care insurance programs such as \nMEDICARE in the U.S. steer the market by their reimbursement policies. Besides \nthe proof of safety and efficacy, those institutions also require additional \ninformation of the costs and benefits resulting from the adoption of a new \ntreatment approach, compared to \u201cstandard care\u201d.  \nThe reimbursement of drugs and procedures has a direct impact on the R&D \nstrategy of technology providers. Studies showed that pharmaceutical companies \ntend to directly reinvest revenue into new R&D programs (Smith and Summers). \nThe drug pricing set by MEDICARE or other payors affects the expected revenue \nand therefore has an impact on amount of money invested in R&D and as a \nconsequence on the timelines of development programs. \nPharmaceutical companies as well as medical device companies are driven by \nmarket incentives and primarily try to maximize their return on invest. Those \ncompanies usually have to manage significant risks during the R&D phases of a \ndrug.  \nThe development process is divided into pre-clinical and clinical phases. The ratio \nof drug candidates entering the first clinical (human) phase and the succeeding \ntherapeutics actually entering the market is only slightly above 10 to 1 in the \ntreatment field of central nervous system (CNS) and only little higher in other \nareas [9].  \nTime to market usually has a direct impact on the revenue of pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Potential products are usually first protected in a patent and then \nfurther developed to enter the market. Therefore, shorter the development time, \nthe longer is the monopolistic period on the market, which leads to significantly \nhigher profitability of the drug.  \nHealth care providers such as physicians primarily have the goal to treat patents in \nthe best possible way. This group of players in the market can be a huge resource \nfor the industry in R&D as well as marketing. Based on their specialized medical \nknowledge and their experience in daily clinical routine, physicians are the \nbiggest source of new ideas.  \n8 \nOnce those ideas are taken up by the industry, physicians are facilitating the \ncreation of the mandatory data for verification and validation of new products. As \na reward for this support, physicians can improve their standing as part of the \nresearch community (e.g. by publishing results about new treatment technologies). \nBeing the experts and opinion leaders in their specific field of research, they also \nhave the potential of being a marketing and lobbying resource for pharmaceutical \nor medical device companies, educating colleagues, but also regulatory authorities \nand insurance companies, on advantages of new products.  \nPatients as the inner core of the market initially create the medical need. In the \npast, they played a quite passive role in the market, but due to better availability \nand transparency within the health care market, patients may now actively decide \non which physician or institution they choose. Having better access to information \nabout latest developments, patients also want to be part of the treatment decisions \nand stimulate health care providers to constantly improve quality of care.  \nDerived from the individual goals of each actor, dependencies between such \nactors can be identified (see Table 2). Those dependences need to be considered in \nPSS design.\n9 \nTable 2: Goals and dependencies of actors in the health care market \n Regulatory Authorities Insurance Companies Pharmaceutical Industry Medical Device Industry Health Care Provider Patient \nRegulatory \nauthorities \nN\/A  \nProof of safety \nProof of efficacy \nDocumentation \nQM-System \nProof of safety \nProof of efficacy \nDocumentation \nQM-System \nImproved safety and \nefficacy \nMinimal impact on daily \nlife \nN\/A \n \nInsurance \ncompanies \nReliable and independent \nanalysis of safety and \nefficacy \nN\/A \nDocumented regulat.  \napproval \nProof of cost efficacy \nDocumented regulat.  \napproval \nProof of cost efficacy \nHigh quality of care \nStandardization \nCost efficacy \nCompliance to treatment \n \n \nPharmaceutic\nal Industry \n \nGuidelines for R&D \nAccelerated procedures \nReimbursement codes for \nagents \nN\/A \nTailored devices and \ntechnologies \nSimplicity \nConsultation \nInput\/Feedback \nParticipate in trials \nAcceptance of approved \ndrugs \nParticipate in trials \nMedical \nDevice \nIndustry  \n \nGuidelines for R&D \nAccelerated procedures \n \nReimbursement codes for \nprocedures \nConsultation \nKnowledge about mode of \naction \nN\/A \nInput\/Feedback \nVerification & Validation \nPublications \nAcceptance of treatment \nprocedures \n \nHealth care \nprovider \n(physicians) \n \nReliable review of safety \nand efficacy of drugs and \ndevices \nReimbursement for \ntreatment procedures and \ndrug prescriptions \nInnovations \nAppreciation of feedback \nand consultation \nInnovations \nAppreciation of feedback \nEasy to use devices \nN\/A \nCompliance to treatment \n \nPatient \n \n \nReliable review of safety \nand efficacy of drugs and \ndevices \nWorking reimbursement \nprocedures \n \nImproved safety and \nefficacy \nMinimal side-effects \n \nImproved safety and \nefficacy \nMinimal impact on daily \nlife \nProvision of best possible \ntreatment \nEducation (disease and \ntreatment) \nN\/A \n10 \n2.2. Product Service Systems in Health Care \nThe health care sector is frequently mentioned in PSS research to be one of the \nareas where the combination of tangible products and intangible services appears \nto offer great opportunity for innovation and improvement [4].  However, actual \ncase studies are lacking in the literature.   \nNevertheless, the health care sector is facing the same trends towards servitization \nas other industry sectors, \u2013 in some cases to an even higher degree.  Therefore, it \nappears appropriate to analyse the specific implications for this sector.  \nDespite the lack of academic research, big medical device companies like General \nElectric Medical Systems were eager to adopt PSS concepts at an early stage [10]. \nThis strategic transition, however, proved to be a formidable challenge even for \nsuch big, well managed companies.  \nAs in other industry sectors, globalisation and its secondary effects have its \nimpact on players in the health care sector.  Being in a much more competitive \nmarket, the need to differentiate becomes increasingly crucial.  \nSpending on health care, projected to be 16,2% of the growth domestic product \n(GDP) in the United States (2007), has grown consistently faster than the overall \neconomy since the 1960s [11].  However, owing to this explosion of costs in \nhealth care, the pressure to reduce cost can be considered to be significantly \nhigher than in other areas.  \nThe medical sector, being one of the most innovative segments, is facing an \naccelerating trend to specialization. Since knowledge rapidly increases and \ndiagnosis as well as treatment gets more and more patient specific, the whole \nnetwork of actors is gaining complexity.  \n\u201cIntegration\u201d therefore becomes a significant value proposition, which, however, \noften is a multi-dimensional challenge.  The integration of a product into a, for \nexample clinical, workflow is one of those dimensions, often requiring additional \nservices such as consulting, training and education.  \nAnother integration is that of products into other tangible products. Those \nproducts may not only include devices but also combinations of drugs and \ndevices, where malfunctions of the whole systems have to be eliminated.  \nLast but not least, products (e.g. operating rooms) may need to be integrated into, \nfor example hospital, infrastructure for optimal usage.  \n11 \nConsidering these dimensions, clinicians, chemists, biologists, software and IT \nspecialists, mechanical engineers, civil engineers, and even architects may be \ninvolved in such integration processes. This increasing need of integration \noutlines a huge potential for service components and PSS in this market. \nAnother clear benefit of PSS in heath care is the close relationship to the user. The \ncommunication between, for example, a developer of medical devices and the end \nuser, namely the physician - probably focused on certain specialties, for example, \nneurosurgery - faces fundamental difficulties due to the different knowledge \nbackground of actors and the different terminologies. A well defined PSS, \nincluding a close relationship between developer and customer, facilitates the \nknowledge transfer and constantly improves the communication between these \ngroups. This ultimately will improve the quality of the provided PSS.  \nAt the same time, medical knowledge is crucial in many cases to actually define \nrequirements and restrictions and to identify the final need for the user. Therefore, \na close cooperation between the user and R&D is the key to enhance health care.  \nBy constantly collecting data about usage, as it is often implemented in PSS, and \nby taking customer feedback into account, sustainability can be achieved in this \nsector as the quality of medical devices enhances the quality of care.  \nProduct service systems may allow establishing new market segments by offering \ntailored solutions to a customer\u2019s need. As the market evolves, such PSS may be \nmodified to address new customer groups or new market scenarios.  \nHowever, the readiness to adopt new procedures, technologies and services may \nsignificantly be reduced by a risk-adverse behaviour of each of the actors.  \nEven in highly research driven and innovative areas such as the health care sector, \nthere is a significant barrier for innovations to be taken up by the market, and \nreplace the current \u201cgolden standard\u201d of care, owing to the common goal of all \nactors to minimize their risk. PSS may enable pioneers to enhance their products \nby complementary service offerings suitable to address this issue. \nSupplementary services, for example user training, user monitoring and according \nretraining, as well as retrospective analysis of usage, allows to minimize the risk \nconsidered to be associated with new products and procedures. While training and \nconsulting services often have a direct impact on the risk profile, other services in \nPSS are designed to generate data for further improvement to mitigate indirectly \nthe risks. For product innovations, additional service components can open up the \n12 \nmarket by creating user acceptance. Added services increase the confidence in \nusing new technologies and therefore PSS can reach a certain threshold of security \nin opening a market, while an innovative product on its own may not reach this \nlevel of user acceptance.  \nFrom PSS provider points of view, this decreases economic risks associated with \ninnovative developments, since the combination of products and services may \nenhance the market penetration and increase the user base. \n \n13 \n3. Case Study: Convection-Enhanced Delivery \n3.1. Methodology and Sectoral-Relevance of the Case \nStudy \nThe seven-step methodology suggested by Morelli (see section 1.3) has been \nfollowed in this case study for the definition of value proposition, a market \nanalysis, the product\/service definition and a use-case analysis.  \nEspecially for the business-to-business PSS, the testing phase, followed by the \nfinal definition, is replaced by individual discussions with contract partners (in \nthis case pharmaceutical companies). Instead of having the market challenging the \nsystem, the PSS has to be individually tailored to a specific customer. In this case \nstudy only the generic part of the development is reported.  \nMajor parts of the business-to-business model outlined in the presented case study \nhave been applied in a collaboration between pharmaceutical company A and \nmedical device company B (see Table 3) to carry out an multinational clinical \ntrial. This initial model was then modified based on a retrospective analysis of the \ncollaboration. The enhanced model has been validated in several expert \ndiscussions, between medical device company B and pharmaceutical companies \nsimilar to pharmaceutical company A with regards to business relevant variables.  \nThe business-to-customer model has been developed based on expert discussions between \npharmaceutical company A and medical device company B, validated in \nsubsequent expert discussions between medical device company B and \npharmaceutical companies substantially similar to pharmaceutical company A. \nTable 3: Details on companies involved in the case study \nCompany Investor structure No. of employees \nPharmaceutical company A Public traded 10-500 \nMedical device company B privately held  500-1000 \n \n \nThe following case study refers to direct, convection-enhanced delivery of \ntherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat aggressive brain tumours or \nneurodegenerative diseases.  \nThis innovative treatment method requires a highly interdisciplinary approach to \ntransfer it from research to market [12]. As the treatment includes drugs as well as \n14 \nseveral medical devices, results of this case study should widely be applicable for \nthe more generic, emerging segment of drug-device combinations.  \nThis combination of drugs and medical devices is a recent trend in the health care \nsector [13]. This is particularly true for the field of local delivery, which \nnecessitates that pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers to \nwork jointly on the research and development issues [14]. In contrast to systemic \ndelivery of therapeutics, where drugs are given by pills or intravenous injection, \nlocal drug delivery allows the drug to be placed exactly at the location in the body \nwhere it is needed. This leads to a high therapeutic concentration at the target, \nwhile the systemic concentration in the body is relatively low, causing less side \neffects and toxicity.  \nRegulatory authorities like the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) are also \naddressing this trend by establishing guidelines [15]. Accordingly, the European \nCommission has also published guidelines for combined devices [16].   \n3.2. Technological Background \nDespite impressive advances in medicine, the treatment of diseases related to the \nbrain such as certain types of aggressive brain tumours and many \nneurodegenerative diseases still presents one of the biggest areas of unmet \nmedical need. This is mainly due to the fact that the brain is protected by the \n\u201cblood brain barrier\u201d (BBB), which prevents it from being damaged or poisoned \nby substances in the human blood stream. While being vital for healthy people, \nthis barrier becomes a major obstacle for the treatment of many diseases affecting \nthe central nervous system (CNS). Promising drugs for the treatment of primary \nbrain tumours such as Glioblasoma mulitforme (GBM) or neurodegenerative \ndiseases such as Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and epilepsy \nhave failed in human trials over the last decades, although these drugs showed \ngreat potential in preclinical studies [17, 18]. Those disappointing results are most \nlikely derived from the fact that the drug molecules never reached their target \nwithin the brain [17].  \nConvection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a promising approach to circumvent the \nBBB. The drug is delivered directly to the target site within the brain tissue, by \nplacing a catheter into the clinical target and applying a positive pressure gradient \nto push the drug into the tissue. In practice, this approach, which is superficially \n15 \nsimple, has been found to be highly complex, since the distribution of the drug is \nheavily depending on patient specific anatomical structures and pathology. \nPlanning therefore is a very crucial part of the procedure and the technique \nrequires a multidisciplinary approach to achieve significant improvement of the \npatient outcome.  \nFrom a technological perspective a tailored system of a safe and effective drug, a \npatient specific treatment planning system and a dedicated set of devices (such as \ncatheters and pumps) is necessary to ensure the delivery of the correct drug in the \ncorrect concentration to the correct target area in a defined period of infusion. The \nstate of the art in this area is represented by catheter systems that promote \nconvection-enhanced diffusion as the infusion mode. Additionally, users, in this \ncase the relevant health-care professionals, need to be trained in the usage of the \nsoftware and hardware tools provided in order to use them in the most optimum \nmanner.   \nAn overview of the system is as follows. Several magnetic resonance (MR) image \nseries of the patient\u2019s brain are acquired for planning purposes.  These scans are \nloaded into a planning software tool in order to plan the exact locations of the \ndrug target and entry points of catheters placed into the target tissue. This \nplanning must be based on the patient specific imaging data as it has to take in \naccount the individual anatomy and pathology of the patient.  \nThe main target of this pre-operational planning is to make sure that a convective \nflow is established within the solid tissue of the brain and that no drug leaks into \nthe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment. Secondly, a maximum coverage of \nthe previously defined clinical target volume is the goal of the planning exercise.  \nOnce the treatment plan is finalized, the required data needs to be transferred to \nthe operating room (OR).  \nThe neurosurgeon will then place the catheters according to the plan using the \nplanning data for navigational purposes. Once all catheters are in place and are \nconnected to the infusion pumps containing the drug, the patient will be scanned \nagain to verify the actual position of the catheters.  \nFor infusion, the patient will be hospitalized for several days to allow the whole \ndrug volume to enter the patient at the required low, constant flow rate. During \nand after the infusion there may be several control scans to monitor the treatment.  \n16 \n3.3. Market Analysis and Value Proposition \nAs outlined above, a system based on infusion via convection-enhanced diffusion \n(CED) shows promise as a delivery method for drugs to allow them to reach \ntherapeutic concentrations in a significant volume of the brain.  \nThis approach however is technically very challenging. Considerable research is \nrequired to develop tools for the delivery of drugs via catheters placed into the \nsolid target tissue.  \nThe current state of the art is represented by the successful development of a \nsoftware tool to aid the critical step of pre-operative planning of the infusions. \nThis has allowed a deeper understanding of the underlying principles to be \naccumulated by the development team.  \nSince such knowledge and tools are usually not available within pharmaceutical \ncompanies, a joint approach is then required to bring the delivery technology, in \ncombination with a working drug, to the market.  \nThis special technological situation combined with the restrictive regulatory \nframework leads to two consecutive use cases: \n A business-to-business PSS to provide a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for \npharmaceutical companies to manage clinical development and to open up \nthe market by getting approval for the drug-device combination \n  A business-to-customer PSS to grow market acceptance once the market \nis opened up by having regulatory approval. \nThese two cases are discussed in more detail below. \nThe first scenario is required to open up the market for a drug in combination with \nthe drug infusion systems.  In such a scenario, the PSS would mainly be focused \non the \u201cbusiness to business\u201d relationship between the medical device company \ndelivering software and hardware tools and the pharmaceutical company \nproviding the drug.  \nIn this scenario, the medical device company has to convince pharmaceutical \ncompanies of the potential of the technology.  Further, it has to justify, in \ncomparison with current practice, any additional risks associated with aspects of \nthe treatment such as the required surgery. \nIdentifying information gaps for all actors in the market serves as an indicator of \nthe issues that need to be addressed by suitable PSS in order to enhance the \nacceptance of the infusion method and create the market. Table 4 shows a list of \n17 \nactors in the market including their generic goals and the main restrictions they \nface.  \nTable 4: Actors and their goals and restrictions   \nActor Goal  Restrictions \nPatients  Optimal treatment Training\/knowledge of doctors \nDoctors Provision of optimal treatment  Knowledge \nAvailability of drugs \nAvailability of tools  \nTraining \nAccess to innovative developments \nPharmaceutical & \nMedical device \ncompanies \nProfitable provision of drugs and \nmedical devices  \nClinical input \nVerification \nValidation \nReimbursement  \nClinical feedback \nInsurance \ncompanies \nCost efficient, safe and effective \ntreatment \nKnowledge about technologies \nAvailability of cost data (treatment costs \nand cost of care) \nRegulatory \nAuthorities \nSafe and effective treatment Knowledge about technologies \n \nAfter the market is opened up by means of the business-to-business PSS, a second \n\u201cbusiness-to-customer\u201d PSS scenario is required to ensure fast market acceptance \nand market penetration of the drug-device combination.  \nThe generic value proposition for convection-enhanced delivery, valid for both \nPSS scenarios is to reliably deliver a therapeutic agent to a specific clinical target \nwithin a patient\u2019s brain. \nIn the first, business-to-business PSS, this value proposition offers the \npharmaceutical company, as the \u201cuser\u201d of the system, firstly, all the required tools \n(products) to operate the system successfully (e.g. planning software, reviewing \nsoftware, data management infrastructure) and, secondly, the services (consulting, \ndata management, quality assurance, trainings, review processes, on-site support) \nto successfully run a clinical trial, minimizing the risk of trial failure. \nIn the business-to-customer PSS, the value proposition is targeted towards the \nneurosurgeon, as the \u201cuser\u201d of such a system.  The user can minimize the risks of \ntreatment by having available the right tools (e.g. planning software, catheters, \ninfusion pumps, etc.)  and services (e.g. training, on-site support, etc.).  \n18 \nCreating this market penetration is obviously of value for both providers of the \ndrug device combination. \n3.4. Users Analysis  \nBased on Morelli\u2019s proposed methodology, the users of both PSS scenarios have \nbeen analysed. In the business-to-business model, a pharmaceutical company in \nthe market of brain tumours would be the customer for the products and services. \nIn the second business-to-customer model, the customer would be any \nneurosurgeon who wants to treat brain tumour patients with this specific drug-\ndevice combination. \nTable 5 shows the results of a users analysis for the business-to-business PSS, \nwhere pharmaceutical companies are the user. \nTable 5: Actors analysis \u2013 Pharmaceutical Companies \nPharmaceutical companies  \nGoals Have approved drugs on the market to effectively treat high-grade \nbrain tumours.  \nKey Problems The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) prevents large molecules from \nentering the brain through the blood cycle.  \nProblem solving strategies Circumvent the BBB by directly delivering the therapeutic agent \nto the target tissue within the brain. \nRequirements to be met by the \nproblem-solving strategies \nAvailability of reliable, easy to use technology for direct drug \ndelivery \nAvailability of users capable of using the technology \nCurrent theories Drug distribution within the brain is dependant on patient specific \nanatomy and pathology. \nTacit knowledge To be effective, the anti cancer agent needs to reach therapeutic \nconcentration level within the target volume  \nDesign methods & criteria  Minimal invasive surgical procedures \nSurgical workflow based on well-known standard procedures \nIntuitive and fast planning of the surgery  \nPatient specific planning \nUsers\u2019 practice  Pharmaceutical companies are used to perform and manage \nclinical trials without the technological complexity associated with \nlocal delivery of the drug \nPerceived substitution function Technological complexity of local drug delivery \nExemplary artefacts - \n \nTable 6 summarizes the analysis of neurosurgeons as the target group for a PSS \noffered, once the market is created and the drug-device combination is available \nfor routine clinical use.  \n19 \nTable 6: Actors analysis \u2013 Neurosurgeons \nNeurosurgeons   \nGoals Provide best possible treatment approach \nBe well educated and trained for treatment approach \nMinimize impact of treatment on daily life of patient \nIncrease survival rates \nImprove quality of life \nKey Problems Probability of recurrence2 is extremely high \nPrognosis is very poor, independent of the treatment  \nTumour resection\n3\n (surgery) is highly invasive  \nRadiotherapy has major side effects  \nChemotherapy has minimal effect and major side effects \nProblem solving strategies Direct delivery of therapeutic agent to the tumour and surrounding \ntissue \nRequirements to be met by the \nproblem solving strategies \nReliability of treatment method \nEase of use of required tools \nAppropriate training  \nAppropriate on-site support \nCurrent theories Drug distribution within the brain is dependant on patient specific \nanatomy and pathology. \nTacit knowledge Minimal invasive treatment is required \nDesign methods & criteria  Minimal invasive surgical procedures \nSurgical workflow based on well-known standard procedures \nIntuitive and fast planning of the surgery  \nPatient specific planning \nUsers\u2019 practice  Precise placement of biopsy needles in order to take tissue \nsamples from a specified target volume within the brain. \nPerceived substitution function - \nExemplary artefacts - \n \n3.5. Product\/Service Definition \nDerived from the users analysis, several service components have been identified \nas crucial for the success of both PSS scenarios (see Table 7). Those services may \nbe combined with the product (software tool for treatment planning including a \nsimulation of drug distribution within the brain tissue based on patient specific \nimaging data) to multiply the use of the software features. The software may, for \nexample, not only be used by neurosurgeons to plan treatments. Reviewers \nauditing neurosurgeons in clinical trials to ensure high compliance to the outlined \n                                                 \n2 return of disease after tumour removal  \n3 removal of tumour in a surgical procedure \n20 \ntrial protocol may also use this tool. Outside the clinical field, the software may \nalso be offered in a business-to-business context to help catheter developers in \ntheir development by simulating different design methods.  Knowledge gathered \nduring the development of the product can be directly translated into services to \ncapitalize on this knowledge.  \nServices may also be tailored to both PSS scenarios. The training of \nneurosurgeons, for example, is required during a trail to minimize failure of the \ntrial due to human error, but this is obviously also is of great importance once the \ntreatment is available on the market.  \nThe presentation of such services as training however may change depending on \nthe target group. While for a small study, the PSS developers can do the training \npersonally, the same training content may have to be provided by a service force \nif a worldwide trial is carried out. To translate this service into the business-to-\ncustomer scenario, with the possibility that any neurosurgeon has to be trained, \nsupporting tools such as e-learning modules have to be applied to keep the quality \nof training high. \n Table 7: Product and service components \nServices Description \nPlanning software tool  The planning tool is the technological basis \nfor the treatment. It can also be recombined \nwith services.  \nClinical trial preparation \nConsulting on CED technologies \nConsulting on trial design \nConsulting on drug selection for CED \nConsulting on patient selection  \nResults and expert knowledge gathered \nduring R&D (incl. verification and \nvalidation) can be offered as a consulting \nservice. \nThis service covers the lack of technological \nexpertise regarding CED methods in \npharmaceutical companies. \nData management for clinical trials  Software may be used as platform to generate \ncompatible data basis for review processes or \nretrospective analysis \nQuality management for clinical trials Software may be used as platform to review \nperformance on a patient-by-patient basis. \nThis reduces risk of trail failure, since \ncorrective measures can be taken during the \ntrial. \nTraining  \nTechnological background of CED \nObtaining useful medical imaging \nSoftware tool and expert knowledge may be \nused to train all involved persons \n(neurosurgeons, radiologists, nurses) \n21 \nUse of software (catheter planning) \nPlacement of catheters (surgical workflow) \nInfusion processes at bed site \nRe-training if required due to results of reviews \nOn-site support Use in-house experts trained on software to \nconsult with neurosurgeons during the \nplanning phase and the surgical procedure \n \n3.6. Use-Case Analysis and PSS Architecture  \nBearing in mind the previously defined product and service components, the two \nbasic use-cases have been analysed to design and visualize PSS suitable to \nestablish a new market and to maintain and grow such a market afterwards. \n3.6.1. The Business-to-Customer Scenario \nAlthough chronologically second, the use case for the scenario after the market \nhas been created has been analysed first, as the efforts to establishing the market \nmay be to no purpose if the method of making the drug delivery route reliable, \nand clinically routine is not designed correctly.  \nFigure 2 illustrates a (simplified) clinical workflow for a patient eligible for \ntreatment. The figure shows the tools and the environment required as well as the \nclinical staff involved in the process of diagnosis and treatment. Once a patient \nenters the workflow, several diagnostic tests will be conducted. For brain tumour \npatients this will include medical imaging. To acquire these medical images, a \nscanner, and scanner software to process the information, are required.  \nThe flow of data and the processing has to be integrated into the system to further \nuse this information for diagnosis, patient education, treatment planning and \nsurgical treatment as well as for retrospective analysis and disease monitoring.  \nOnce the patient is referred to treatment, the planning software may take available \ndata from the diagnostic imaging (additional imaging may be acquired upon \nrequest) for the treatment planning. A neurosurgeon will then use the software \ntool to plan the treatment based on the patient-specific imaging data to ensure a \nhigh coverage of the clinical target. The finalized treatment plan can then be \ntransferred to the OR, where the  pre-planned catheters are surgically placed  by \nthe neurosurgeon.  \n22 \nOnce the surgical procedure is completed, the infusion of the anti cancer drug will \nbe started at the intensive care station. To monitor the treatment outcome, follow-\nup scans are performed. The complexity of treatment planning for such drug \ninfusion techniques requires additional services, such as training of neurosurgeons \n(to plan and actually place catheters correctly during surgery), radiologists (to \nacquire the right medical images for the treatment planning) and nurses (to \ncorrectly maintain the infusion).   \nAs a single component, like a working drug is not sufficient to treat patients and \ntherefore generate the safety and efficacy data required for market approval, an \nintegrated PSS addressing all these requirements is mandatory to get a drug, \ndelivered with a catheter-based infusion technique, onto the market. \n \n23 \n \nFigure 2: Visualization of use-case for the business-to-customer PSS\n24 \n \nLooking at this proposed workflow, the required features of products and services \ncan be recognised.  \nTable 8 lists the key features identified for the planning software in order to \nfacilitate the catheter planning and placement process. \nTable 8: Critical product features \nKey software features \nEase of use \/ no time consuming planning \nAutomatic image analysis \nOutline of clinical targets \nAbility to communicate with hospital data management system (PACS4) \nAbility to fuse (overlay) scans from different time points \nCompatibility with surgical navigation system \nIntegration with catheter technology (e.g. consideration of catheter diameter in the planning) \nIntegration with pump technology (e.g. consideration of pressure fluctuations caused by the pump) \n \nAdditionally, the following service-oriented features have been identified for the \nbusiness-to-customer scenario (see Table 9): \nTable 9: Critical service features for a business-to-customer scenario  \nKey service features \nAppropriate knowledge transfer from R&D into clinic \nTraining on planning software use \nConsulting on surgical workflow \nTraining on catheter handling \nConsulting on integration into hospital IT \nConsulting on protocols for medical imaging required for planning \nEasy access to information for retraining (e.g. web based e-learning tools) \nAvailability of on-site support, if required \nFeedback processes to incorporate users feedback in enhanced developments \n \n3.6.2. The Business-to-Business Scenario \nFigure 3 shows a visualization of a use-case scenario\n5\n as the basis for the \nbusiness-to-business PSS required in order to obtain approval for clinical use for a \ndrug-infusion method combination.  \n                                                 \n4 Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) \n5 based on Morelli \n25 \nA pharmaceutical company developing drugs for brain tumours (or \nneurodegenerative diseases) would have to make decisions about how newly \ndeveloped drugs in the R&D pipeline should be delivered to the clinical target.  \nSuch a company may also consider further screening of drugs which have been \npreviously developed. Of interest would be those drugs where there is clear \nindication of effectiveness, but where the drug failed in previous trials for \nparticular sets of reasons.  Where those reasons for failure include the drug failing \nto reach the clinical target, or showing unacceptable side effects when given \nsystemically\n6\n, such drugs may be reconsidered for use in combination with a new \ninfusion system. \nThis screening process requires an in-depth understanding of underlying \nprinciples of the infusion mode, which can be offered to a pharmaceutical \ncompany as a consulting service, using knowledge derived from the knowledge \nbase in R&D.  \nA significant barrier for pharmaceutical companies to actually use infusion as a \ndelivery method for their molecules is that this technology adds to the complexity \nto the treatment and, therefore, also to the setup of a clinical trial. By offering \nservices to close gaps of expertise and knowledge, those barriers can be \neliminated.  \nBy consulting drug companies on the design of the clinical trial in the planning \nphase and also the management of the trial, risks of trial failure can be mitigated.  \n \n                                                 \n6 given orally or intravenously  \n27 \n \nFigure 3: Visualization of use-case for the business-to-business PSS\n28 \n \n \nTable 10: Critical service features for a business-to-business scenario \nKey service features \nConsulting on clinical protocols and procedures \nAvailability of training materials \nData management for clinical trials (especially processing of imaging data) \nQuality management of clinical trials (review and audit processes by means of the planning software as a \nreview tool) \nTraining on planning software use (for neurosurgeons) \nTraining on infusion procedures (for nurses) \nTraining on imaging protocols (for radiologists) \nConsulting on surgical workflow (for neurosurgeons) \nTraining on catheter handling and placement (for neurosurgeons) \nEasy access to information for retraining (e.g. web based e-learning tools) \nAvailability of on-site support, if required \nAnalysis of patient data during the trial to minimize risk of trial failure \nAnalysis of data in the light of predefined research questions \nFeedback processes to incorporate users feedback in enhanced developments \n \nThe analysis of the presented case study suggests that further research on PSS \napplied in the field of health care is required to identify areas where benefits of \nPSS match unmet needs in the health care sector. Subsectors within the health \ncare sector will have to be analyzed with regards to potential added benefit by \nmeans of PSS. In addition, guidelines for designing and implementing PSS in a \nhealth care market environment have to be developed and validated in order to \nfacilitate adoption in the industry.    \n \n4 Conclusions \nProduct Service Systems in health care have not been in the focus of PSS research \nin the past, although the concept holds great potential to address major challenges \nin this sector.  \nThe cost explosion and additional cost pressure resulting from globalization is a \nserious threat to the industry also in the health care sector. PSS is a useful tool to \nreduce costs and resources while maximizing the outcome. Companies can \ncapitalize on the knowledge they generate during the research and development \nprocess of a product, by selling this knowledge in separate services. In addition, \n29 \nproducts may also be reused in combination with several different services. This \nis especially true for software products, which can easily be recombined with \nservices to provide additional benefit for a customer group or to exploit new \nmarkets. \nDue to the high degree of specialization in medical health care and increased \ncomplexity of technology, integration of technologies, products and services \nbecomes a whole field of new service components expected by the customer.  \nProducts (tools) and information have to be available at the right point and in \nrequired quality during more complex clinical workflows facing a significant \nincrease of actors and interfaces caused by specialization and digitalization of \npatient data. \nPSS offers the chance to establish an extremely close relationship to the user. This \nis of special benefit for developers in the health care sector, since the knowledge \ngap between developers (e.g. engineers or software developers) and physicians is \ngenerally quite wide. From a company\u2019s perspective PSS creates an access to \ncustomers as part of the R&D and quality management processes owing to this \nclose relationship.  \nIn a business-to-business scenario, closer relationships can be established between \nbusiness partners. Those business relations are more likely to be of a cooperative \nnature, since PSS ultimately focus on the final benefit for the end user, which \nstreamlines efforts of all partners towards the same goal.  This stands in contrast \nto, for example, supply chain thinking, were each participant in the chain tries to \nmaximize its revenue on the following company in the chain and in fact may not \nbeware of the final customer. Processes can be optimized on a higher level by \nhaving this common final goal. \nThe interdisciplinary approaches required for the success of combinations of drug \nand drug-delivery techniques set a high requirement on communication between \nusers and developers. \nSince PSS causes the designer of those systems to focus on the final customer \nneed, it is a very helpful tool for strategic considerations. The combination of \nproducts and services may have the critical mass to establish the market, while a \nproduct on its own may face too many barriers. Those barriers for a market entry \ncan be specifically eliminated with additional services.  In addition, knowledge \ncreated during the development process can be sold as consulting and training \n30 \nservices leading to increased revenue but also creating additional benefit for the \nuser.  \nOnce on the market PSS can increase market acceptance compared to a product \nwithout supplementary services. Especially in the launch of a PSS, this can lead to \na broader base of potential customers, for example if services are offered that \neducate customers in using a product that usually would just be used by a small \ngroup of experts. Additionally, the market penetration can be increased, if services \nand products are designed for an easier user adoption.   \n31 \nReferences \n  \n1.     Baines TS, Lightfoot HW, Evans S et al.
