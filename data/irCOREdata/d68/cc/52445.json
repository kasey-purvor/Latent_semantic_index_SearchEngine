All rights reserved \nKeywords: Bohaiwan; Dagang; Jiyang; Huimin; Shengli \n1. Current status of CCS in China \nThe concept of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is gaining momentum in \nChina with: in 2008, the successful addition of demonstration-scale post-\ncombustion capture technology to the Huaneng Group Gaobeidian Power plant in \nBeijing [1,2]; the building of an IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) \nplant as part of a three-phase project to build a full scale commercial pre-\ncombustion power plant (GREENGEN [3]); and the announcement of a full-chain \nCCS project in the Ordos Basin ([4]Chinadaily.com 2010). The Gaobeidian plant \ncaptures 3000 tonnes CO2 per year using amine scrubbing of flue gases (capture \nbegan in June 2008). The CO2 stream is 99% pure, food-grade and is sold to the \nbeverage industry.  \nGeological storage options for CO2 have been explored through the \nGeoCapacity (EU Framework 6), COACH (EU Framework 6) and China-UK \nNZEC (Near Zero Emission from Coal - phase I funded by UK Department of \nEnergy and Climate Change) projects. These included the PetroChina-operated \nDagang, Daqing, Huabei and Jilin oil field complexes, and the China Petroleum \nand Chemical Corporation (SINOPEC)-operated Shengli and Jiangsu oil field \ncomplexes. Aquifers in the Jiyang Depression adjacent to the Shengli oil field \ncomplex, the Jizhong Depression around the Huabei oil field complex and aquifers \nwithin the Jilin oil field complex were also assessed [5,6,7,8,9]. \n2. Sources \nThe main concentration of large point sources of CO2 lies along the east coast of \nChina. The emissions of the largest sources in the Shandong Province, eastern \nChina, were assessed for the COACH project; annual emissions were estimated to \nbe 201 MtCO2 (million tonnes of CO2). The power sector dominated the emissions, \nand the largest single source emits around 11 MtCO2\/year (million tonnes CO2 per \nyear) [10]. To store emissions from these industrial sources will require not only a \nsite with a large capacity, but also with good injectivity and effective seals.  \nRetrofitting of power plants for CCS is expected to be technically challenging \nand potentially expensive, so where power stations can be built with CCS in the \noriginal design they may prove easier targets for capture. An example of this is the \nIGCC GREENGEN power plant which lies close to the storage sites studied in the \nCOACH project (GREENGEN was a COACH project partner). Construction began \nin July 2009 on this 250 MW (Mega-Watt) IGCC power plant in Binhai Area, \nTianjin, and this phase should be completed by 2011. It is intended that this plant \nwill be followed by construction of another larger plant (400 MW IGCC) with pre-\n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000\u2013000  \ncombustion CO2 capture, most likely near the current Tianjin gasifier site (this will \nbe GREENGEN phase II, planned for 2011-2015). Anticipated emissions from \nGREENGEN phase II are a little over 2 MtCO2\/year (million tonnes per year). \nDiscussions are underway with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and \nPetroChina on storage sites for GREENGEN phase II. Additional funding and \npolicy support is required for phase II. GREENGEN phase III (400 MW \ndemonstration plant with hydrogen production and CCS ready for \ncommercialization) is planned for 2013-2017.  The location of GREENGEN phase \nIII has not yet been confirmed.  \n3. Storage potential \nGeological assessment of the Dagang and Shengli oil field complexes indicates \nthat these fields are complex; being compartmentalized by faulting and highly \nvariable lithology. Each field contains numerous individual reservoirs from which \noil and\/or gas are produced. The estimated capacity of the selected suitable \nreservoirs in the Dagang oil field complex was 22 MtCO2, with the largest capacity \nfound in the Gangdong oil field (8 MtCO2 storage [5,6,7]). This oil field complex is \nevidently too small to contain large-scale emissions, but its proximity to CO2 \nsource, including the proposed Greengen phase II plant to be built at Tianjin, \nmeans that it could potentially be considered for an early pilot-scale scheme of \nstorage and CO2-EOR. A concern with this oil field is the number of boreholes \nalready drilled; the Gangdong oil field alone contains over 600 wells within an area \nof 23.7 km2. These wells would have to be considered in any evaluation of security \nof storage for their potential to permit CO2 migration out of the reservoirs. Another \nissue is the compartmentalization of the fields; this could enable secure storage \nwithin each compartment but since numerous boreholes are required to effectively \nexploit the hydrocarbons trapped in this region, it is anticipated that if CO2 were \ninjected here, numerous boreholes with multiple perforations would be required to \ninject into the many compartments and reservoirs of these oil fields. Additionally, \nas the reservoirs are often divided into isolated compartments by faulting or \nlithology, it is almost certain that pressure relief wells would be required to \nproduce oil and water (either utilizing pre-existing wells or new wells). \nThe Shengli oil field complex has an estimated storage capacity of 472 MtCO2, \ncontained in numerous porous layers and lenses, surrounded by and sealed by \nimpermeable mudstone and claystone layers [5,6,7]. This initial estimate suggests \nthis field could contain the emissions from the lifetime of the GREENGEN phase II \nplant (around 2 MtCO2\/year, this phase is planned for 2011-2015). Porosity and \npermeability of the formations is highly variable and injectivity is expected to be \nlow. As in the Dagang oil field complex, these fields are compartmentalized and so \nthe same concerns over the number of boreholes required apply. CO2\u2013EOR could \nbe considered in the Shengli oil field complex, offsetting some of the financial cost \nof CO2 capture.  \nThe largest capacity of the sites investigated was identified in the aquifers of the \nHuimin sub-basin within the Jiyang Depression, adjacent to the Shengli oil field \ncomplex. The Guantao Formation is hydrocarbon bearing in the Shengli oil field \ncomplex but generally non-hydrocarbon bearing in the adjacent Huimin sub-basin \ndue to immaturity of source rocks. If the sealing formations are equally effective in \nthe Huimin sub-basin as in the oil fields, then the Guantao Formation could offer \ncopious potential storage. Areas where the Guantao Formation has thick sandstone \nlayers were selected in the Huimin sub-basin (Figure 1Figure 1). These areas had \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000\u2013000 \n4 \n \nan estimated storage capacity of 700 MtCO2 [5,6,7]. As yet, sufficient data are not \navailable to identify antiformal closures and so assessment has focused on regions \nof thick sandstone with the aspiration that later work will identify closures suitable \nfor storage. This storage estimate needs to be considered with caution as there are \nless data available than in the oil field areas and so the potential aquifer storage \nsites are less well understood, and there remains the possibility that they may also \nbe compartmentalized by faulting and lithological variations as in the adjacent oil \nfields.  \n4. A potential storage solution \nThe Dagang oil field complex could be exploited for a pilot scale CO2-EOR \nproject, continuing from this, CO2 could be transported further to the Jiyang \nDepression and injected into the Shengli oil field complex for CO2-EOR and \nstorage and simultaneously into the adjacent aquifers for large-scale storage (Figure \n1Figure 1). A pilot project in the Dagang oil field complex would build expertise \nand experience of CCS in China. This knowledge and experience could then be \ntransferred to a larger-scale project in the Shengli oil field complex and Huimin \nsub-basin aquifers. Simultaneous CO2 storage in the aquifer and supply for EOR in \nthe Shengli oil field complex would provide CO2 as needed for the oil field (the \namount would vary through the lifetime of a EOR project, for example, CO2 \nproduced after breakthrough at the wells could be recycled and as a result, lower \namounts of new CO2 would be required from the source). As CCS became more \nwidely deployed, CO2 from other sources in this industrial region could be brought \nto this joint EOR and storage project creating a \u2018CO2 network\u2019 \nThe next step for this potential storage solution is detailed investigation of the \nstorage  capacity of the aquifer and oil fields. This requires modeling of the aquifer \nbased on seismic and borehole data, testing of seal properties and analysis of \nsandstone for its reservoir properties (for example, see work undertaken for the \nSleipner storage site 11,12,13,14,15]. Pilot schemes and storage\/CO2-EOR in the \noil field complexes requires collaboration with PetroChina and SINOPEC; their \nknowledge and experience of these fields gained through decades of hydrocarbon \nextraction and re-use of exploration data will allow detailed modeling of the \npotential for CO2 storage and CO2-EOR. \n \n5. Future of CCS in China \nTwo major barriers to CCS in China are the financial cost of CCS and access to \ndetailed scientific data. The former can be overcome through collaboration and \ndevelopments in CCS technologies driving down the price of implementation. \nUnfortunately, at present, the cost of CCS makes it unattractive for large scale \ndeployment; changes in policy are required to stimulate investment, not just in \nChina, but worldwide. Access to data remains difficult partly because data are \nacquired by oil companies and held as confidential in perpetuity. Other data are \nacquired and held by state-level geological surveys or mineral companies. Both the \nCOACH and China-UK NZEC projects shared publicly available data which \n Author name \/ Energy Procedia 00 (2011) 000\u2013000  \npermitted the initial assessment of these storage sites. However, for more detailed \nwork, primary data such as seismic and borehole data and results of geochemical \ntesting are required. An exception to this was the COACH project assessment of \nthe Dagang oil field complex where PetroChina, a project partner, shared oil field \ndata they had acquired including oil reserves, reservoir properties and maps \nthrough their subsidiary company the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration \nand Development (RIPED). \n6. Conclusion \nFrom the geological assessment of the Bohaiwan Basin in eastern China, the \nShengli oil field complex and adjacent Jiyang Depression were identified as being \nof interest for geological storage of CO2 but require more detailed evaluation. The \nDagang oil field complex was identified as having potential for a pilot-scale project \nbut also requires further detailed investigation. It is suggested that simultaneous \nutilization of these sites could offer a more complete storage solution; the Dagang \noil field complex, closest to the planned GREENGEN phase II plant at Tianjin \ncould be used to prove the concept of CCS and CO2-EOR in the geologically \nchallenging conditions of these Chinese oil fields. This could then be followed by \nCO2-EOR in the Shengli oil field complex, with additional injection and storage in \nthe adjacent aquifer formations of the Huimin sub-basin. Such operations would \nallow largescale storage not only from the GREENGEN phase II plant (and \npossibly GREENGEN phase III if nearby), but also potentially from other large \nCO2 sources in this industrial region. They would also support security of energy \nsupply and offset some of the financial costs of a CCS project. \nThere is great interest in implementing CCS in China, from both Chinese and \nexternal parties, however, there are barriers to this which need to be overcome \nthrough future collaboration, global technology development and knowledge \nsharing.  \n7.
