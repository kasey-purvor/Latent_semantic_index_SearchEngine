in Institutions (DPAM)\nPart II: A synthesis of the 4-04 programme on digital preservation \nand asset management in institutions for the JISC Information \nEnvironment \n1 Introduction\nIn mid-2006, JISC requested that the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), in its \ncapacity as a centre of excellence on digital preservation and digital curation, \nundertake a small-scale study to synthesise and help disseminate the results of \nprojects   funded   under   the   Supporting   Digital   Preservation   and   Asset \nManagement in Institutions (DPAM) programme. This report is the final outcome \nof that exercise. \nThe study ran from November 2006 to June 2007. Study data was collected \nduring interviews and through desk based research, supplemented by e-mail or \ntelephone contact. The study has resulted in production of a two-part report: \npart   I   contains   an   overall   programme   and   project-level   evaluation   with \nsubsequent recommendations for JISC; part II (this part) contains the synthesis \nexercise itself. Project documents and deliverables were valuable sources for \ndevelopment of this synthesis and have on occasion been re-used or adapted \nwithout specific attribution. Hyperlinks to the relevant project documents have \nbeen embedded into the report wherever they were found to be publicly-\navailable.\nThis synthesis will be made available at the JISC website http:\/\/www.jisc.ac.uk, \nthe  Digital Curation Centre website  http:\/\/www.dcc.ac.uk, and the UKOLN \nwebsite  http:\/\/www.ukoln.ac.uk.

Each organisation has developed similar but different systems \nfor record keeping and the generation and storage of metadata relating to the \nfiles stored.  However, these systems were developed and put in place prior to \nthe definition of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference model \nand the Metadata and Encoding Transmission Standard (METS) and therefore \nwhilst it is assumed that both organisations broadly comply with the standards, \nneither has fully tested its infrastructure or metadata systems for compatibility \nwith them.\n2 This project permitted a thorough testing of the assumption. \nThe main elements of the project included:\n\u00b7 mapping of the systems and metadata currently in use by the two \norganisations against those in the OAIS reference model and the \nMETS standard\n\u00b7 practical testing of the theoretical argument that the two partners \ncomply with OAIS (though it is widely accepted that compliance can \ntake a number of forms)\n\u00b7 exploration of the suitability of METS within an OAIS environment.\n2 Open Archival Information System reference model: \nhttp:\/\/public.ccsds.org\/publications\/archive\/650x0b1.pdf ; \nMETS official website: http:\/\/www.loc.gov\/standards\/mets\/ \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 4DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe project concluded that, based on its assessment, both organisations \nexceeded the requirements of the OAIS reference model. Assessment of \npractical   implementations   of   the   model   identified   potential   discrepancies \ninherent   in   the   current   model,   particularly   an   overstated   strength   in   the \nrelationship   between   the   OAIS   concepts   of   producer   and   Designated \nCommunity, and the separation of the stored Archival Information Package from \nthe stored Dissemination Information Package. Such detailed exploration and \nassessment of the model enabled the project to contribute to the reference \nmodel's five year review. \nThe project\u2019s assessment of the potential use of METS within an OAIS \nenvironment concluded that although there may be potential for its use in the \nfuture, there was little advantage to be gained at this moment in time by using \nMETS over other more formal metadata standards. The flexibility of the schema \nwas on the one hand deemed useful as it could be adapted for preservation \npurposes in environments with different object and preservation requirements. \nOn the other hand, this very flexibility had potential to limit interoperability in a \nnetwork of repositories that do not use the same tools and metadata content. \nVarying vocabularies and terminology between different stakeholder groups is \noften cited as a cause for concern when developing or discussing approaches \nto preservation. The project found the shared terminology of the OAIS model \ninvaluable as a means of communication between the UKDA and TNA, as the \nworking terminologies of each are different despite their shared sectoral and \narchiving backgrounds. \nThe project found that the model was not highly scalable. This was felt to be a \nproblem for smaller archives that wished to gain value from the model and \nachieve compliance with its main elements. As a result of this, TNA has \ncommissioned work on producing an 'OAIS Lite' smaller scale version of the \nmodel for smaller scale archival institutions.  \nThis highly specific and localised project produced valuable input for project \npartners on the role of the OAIS and METS standards within their current \ntechnical and organisational infrastructures for long term preservation. This \nenabled it to make significant contributions to the wider preservation and \nstandards community, most publicly in the form of it contribution to the global \nOAIS five year review process. From a more practical perspective, the project \nalso produced a valuable text-based tool to assist other organisations in \nassessing   their   own   storage   systems   for   OAIS   compliance.   Answers   to \nquestions posed in the tool will help when comparing the functions and \nworkflows of an archive with those recommended by the OAIS standard.\nOutputs \n\u00b7 Assessment of UKDA and TNA compliance with OAIS and METS     \nstandards: final report\noSet of questions for OAIS compliance self-testing (pp 105 - 107)\n3.1.2 DAAT: Digital Asset Assessment Tool\nThe DAAT project brought together extensive preservation expertise from a \nbroad range of institutions: University of London Computing Centre (ULCC), the \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 5DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nArts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS), the National Preservation Office \n(NPO), The National Archives (TNA), the British Library (BL), Kings College \nLondon (KCL), the School of Advanced Study of the University of London, and \nthe Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC). Led by ULCC, the project aimed to \ndevelop a digital preservation assessment tool for institutions to identify the \npreservation needs of their digital holdings so that scarce resources could be \nfocussed on those assets where the risk of loss and cost of loss was found to \nbe greatest. \nThe   project   expected   to   base   the   DAAT   tool   on   an   existing   tool   (PAS \nPreservation Assessment Survey) produced by the National Preservation Office \n(NPO) which was already used in various forms to assess traditional collections \nin libraries, museums and archives and to assess photographic collections.\n3 \nThis proved not to be feasible: the project\u2019s primary conclusion was that the \ndata collection model common to all varieties of PAS was not suitable for use in \nthe digital environment. Furthermore, it was deemed possible that even the \nunderlying conceptual model of where risk lies and how it is measured does not \ntranslate well from traditional materials to digital collections.\nThe project performed significant work in producing a digital survey tool and \nreports on what risk factors need to be assessed and the attributes an ideal \nsurvey tool would possess. It also assessed a range of automated file format \nassessment tools such as JHOVE and DROID as possible components of a \nfuture,   more   automated,   digital   asset   assessment   tool.   However,   it \nfundamentally determined that automated tools are still not capable of assigning \na  value to  digital assets, a  vital step  in determining where  preservation \nresources are best spent.\nOutputs\n\u00b7 DAAT Project website   \n\u00b7 DAAT project final report     (October 2006)\n\u00b7 Assessment of Risk Factors     (September 2006) \u2013 an assessment of \nthe risk factors that may affect the survival of digital assets and would \ntherefore need measured by an automatic risk assessment tool\n\u00b7 Assessment of Attributes     (September 2006) \u2013 an assessment of the \nfunctional attributes needed in a digital asset assessment tool\n\u00b7 Assessment   of   file   format   testing   tools      (February   2006)   -   an \nassessment of selected existing file format testing tools: DROID, \nJHOVE and AIHT Empirical Walker \n\u00b7 Database and data entry tool: D-PAS      (September 2006) \u2013 a pilot \nsystem   reworking   the   NPO's   PAS   tool   for   digital   assets.

The programme \nspecifically aimed to develop and deliver a modular training programme with \ncontent targeted at all levels of staff, from service or project managers to \ntechnical and operational staff. DPTP's broader aim was to equip staff with the \nskills, tools and confidence to be able to embark on a pragmatic and cost-\neffective digital preservation programme appropriate to their own institutional \nneeds, taking into account the practical reality that any approach to digital \npreservation is iterative and that no organisation is able to leap instantly into a \nfully formed digital preservation programme. \nThe course brought together delegates from technical, managerial and archival \nbackgrounds to learn the same standards and methods for digital preservation, \nexamining   the   need   for   policies,   planning,   strategies,   standards   and \nprocedures. Content was derived in part from the Cornell Digital Preservation \nManagement Workshop in the US; further content was drawn from the UK \nDigital Preservation handbook (Beagrie & Jones, 2002) or provided by selected \nexperts resident in the UK.\n4 \nThe course was delivered on three occasions, each time as a week-long \nresidential   course.   Topics   were   covered   using   a   mixture   of   lectures, \ndiscussions, practical tasks and a class project.

Based at the University of Glasgow, the two year \nproject sought to develop and implement a sustainable business-focussed \nmodel for digital preservation as part of a wider knowledge management \nagenda in HE institutions. In particular, the project intended to identify the \ninstitutional   costs   and   benefits   of   developing   a   coherent,   managed   and \nsustainable   approach   to   the   preservation   of   its   digital   assets   in   a   way \ntransparent to all stakeholders. \nThe scope of the project later developed from digital preservation in HE \ninstitutions out to the wider information environment and including public sector \norganisations. This extension of the project meant that digital preservation was \nembedded into the broader life cycle of digital information management and \nfunding applications. Applicability of the final model is therefore significantly \nmore extensive than first planned. A significant impact of this development \nhowever, is that costs and benefits associated explicitly with digital preservation \nhave not been explored within the duration of the project.\nThe final model developed by ESPIDA  can help make business cases for \nproposals that may not necessarily offer immediate financial benefit to an \norganisation, but rather bring benefit in more intangible spheres. It is being used \ninitially within the area of digital resource management, but has potential for far \nwider application in articulating the value of many different types of projects \nwhere the primary outcomes are intangible, and thus in the creation of business \ncases and demonstrating the return on those investments. \nOutputs \n\u00b7 ESPIDA project website   \n\u00b7 ESPIDA final report   \n\u00b7 ESPIDA handbook & model   \n\u00b7 Sample outcome scorecards\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 8DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u00b7 Sample cost template\n\u00b7 Case studies\n\u00b7 Institutional Repository Case Study\n\u00b7 eTheses Case Study\n\u00b7 Museum Archival Collection Case Study\n\u00b7 ESPIDA Training exercise     \u2013 offers training in how to use the ESPIDA \nhandbook and model \n\u00b7 ESPIDA brochure   \n\u00b7 ESPIDA bibliography   \nArticles\n\u00b7 James Currall & Peter McKinney (2006), 'Investing in Value.

Led by University College London (UCL) in collaboration with the \nBritish Library, the LIFE project aimed to rectify this situation by exploring and \ndeveloping a life cycle approach to costing the digital archiving and preservation \nprocess within a digital library environment.\nThe LIFE project drew significantly on an existing life cycle costing model for \nanalogue materials first developed by the British Library in the 1980's. This was \nadapted and extended into a formula and methodology that allows institutions to \ncalculate the long term costs and future requirements for the preservation and \nongoing care of their digital assets. The model was developed and tested on \nthree different types of digital library collections, each of which was published as \na case study. \nThe project established that a life cycle approach to costing is both useful and \napplicable for a range of digital collections, a conclusion is supported by the \nBritish Library's subsequent broad adoption of the LIFE methodology and \nformula. Similar interest has been shown from other quarters. Case studies \nhighlighted the need for automated tools to reduce the costs associated with \ndigital preservation activities. LIFE2 has recently been funded to further explore \nthe LIFE formula and costing knowledge base using a broader range and \nvariety of digital collections.\n5 \nOutputs\n\u00b7 LIFE project website   \n\u00b7 LIFE project summary report   \n5 LIFE2 website: http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/ls\/life\/2\/ \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 10DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u00b7 LIFE project final report   \n\u00b7 LIFE formula & methodology\n\u00b7 Case studies:\n\u00b7 Voluntarily Deposited Electronic Publications\n\u00b7 Web Archives\n\u00b7 e-Journals\n\u00b7 LIFE Generic Preservation Model for Voluntarily Deposited Electronic     \nPublications \u2013 MS Excel functional spreadsheet\n\u00b7 LIFE Generic Preservation Model for Web Archives      \u2013 MS Excel \nfunctional spreadsheet\n\u00b7 LIFE Research Review: mapping the landscape, riding the life cycle     \n(November 2005) \u2013 an exploration of existing digital preservation and \nlife cycle costing research\n\u00b7 LIFE bibliography     (May 2006) \nEvents\n\u00b7 LIFE Conference, 20 April 2006, British Library Conference Centre, \nLondon\nConference papers\/presentations\n\u00b7 Paul Ayris,  UCL e-journals case study,  LIFE Conference (April 2006)\n\u00b7 Rory McLeod, Case study: the legal deposit of electronic publications, \nLIFE Conference (April 2006)\n\u00b7 Paul   Wheatley,  Modelling   the   digital   preservation   costs,  LIFE \nConference, (April 2006)\n\u00b7 Rory Mcleod, The British Library Digital Preservation Strategy, State \nLibrary of Queensland (December 2006) \n\u00b7 Paul Ayris & James Watson, life cycle Information For E-literature, \nDCC\/DPC workshop on Cost Models for preserving digital assets \n(July 2005)\n\u00b7 James Watson, Why Digital Collections should ride life cycles, JISC \nJoint programmes meeting (July 2005) \n\u00b7 James Watson, LIFE: life cycle Information For E-literature, ESPIDA \nevent (February 2005)\nPosters\n\u00b7 LIFE project poster     DCC 2nd Annual Conference (November 2006)\n\u00b7 LIFE project poster Open Scholarship 2006 (October 2006)\n\u00b7 LIFE project poster     JISC joint programmes meeting (July 2005)\nArticles\n\u00b7 DPC Featured project interview - LIFE (June 2006) \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 11DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n3.1.6 MANDATE: Managing Digital Assets in Tertiary Education\nThe MANDATE project was the only project funded within a college FE \nenvironment.   John   Wheatley   College   in   Glasgow   sought   to   develop   a \nmanagement toolkit to support asset management and preservation with a \nfocus   on   digital   curriculum   and   learning   objects.   This   included   materials \nassociated with curricular administration and quality control processes liable to \nretention requirements and legal obligations (such as disclosure under the \nFreedom of Information Act). The toolkit was developed on the basis of internal \ninvestigations and testing within the John Wheatley college. \nThis ambitious but tightly focussed project addressed the management of \nobjects throughout their life cycle. The main objectives of the project were to:\n\u00b7 create a toolkit to support digital asset management and preservation \nin FE colleges based on research practice to be piloted in John \nWheatley College and supported by the Centre for Digital Library \nResearch   (CDLR)   and   the   Scottish   Library   Information   Council \n(SLIC);\n\u00b7 develop a system which would format, index, and store existing \nunstructured   digital   materials   created   in   previously   disparate \nprocesses and from the research practice create and test templates \nand workflow models for routine use in John Wheatley College and \nfor application across the sector;\n\u00b7 develop appropriate structures for web-based storage of information \nthat will contribute to the end goal of improved digital preservation; \nand \n\u00b7 examine   the   roles   of   various   staff   \u2013   teaching   staff,   librarians, \nadministrators, technicians - in the creation of appropriate metadata\nThe toolkit is aimed primarily at managers, administrative and technical staff \nconsidering the management of digital assets in colleges, although use of the \ncontents are by no means limited to this group and the contents are relevant for \nanyone considering implementation of a digital asset management system. The \ntoolkit discusses some of the main issues to be considered in development of a \ndigital asset management strategy and poses questions for consideration based \non these issues. It highlights and supports the recommendations in the toolkit \nthrough the illustrative case study on implementation at John Wheatley College, \nin which the digital asset management system is used to organise materials \nsupporting learning and teaching, as well as the publication of papers relating to \nthe College's governance.\nOne of the key conclusions to be drawn from the project is the need for \norganisational \/cultural issues to be addressed alongside technical issues. \nSignificant conclusions were also drawn with regards to metadata, paticularly \nthat  collection  from  depositors must be  as simple  as  possible, and that \nautomatically captured or generated metadata is the key to both information \nretrieval and information services. This conclusion is compatible with the \nfindings of other larger preservation and storage initiates.\n6 Finally, and again in \nkeeping with the conclusions of other projects, preservation is but part of the life \n6 For example, the PARADIGM project.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 12DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\ncycle;   organisations   must   first   coherently   manage   digital   assets   before \nattempting to undertake specific preservation activities.\n7\nOutputs \n\u00b7 MANDATE website   \n\u00b7 MANDATE project final report   \n\u00b7 MANDATE toolkit   \n\u00b7 Strategy   \n\u00b7 Asset Types   \n\u00b7 Metadata     \n\u00b7 Workflow     \n\u00b7 Interoperability     \n\u00b7 Preservation     \n\u00b7 Legislation     \n\u00b7 Software     \n\u00b7 Training     \n\u00b7 Case Study   \n\u00b7 Glossary   \nArticles\n\u00b7 Craig Green, Digital assets: Mandate for the Future  in  Information \nScotland April 2006 Vol 4(2)\nConference papers\/presentations\n\u00b7 Craig Green, The JISC MANDATE project, at 'Sharing vision planning \npractice' 1\nst  annual SLIC\/FE member conference, John Wheatley \nCollege, (November 2006)\n3.1.7 Managing Risk: A model business preservation strategy for corporate business \nassets\nThis small scale project at Kings College London (KCL) aimed to establish \ndevelopment of a new digital asset management strategy for the college. It \naddresses a common institutional need for a digital asset management strategy \nthat   combines   academic   and   learning   resources   together   with   corporate \ninformation and thus acts as a valuable case study from which the wider HE \ncommunity can learn.\nThe project carried out a survey into existing digital assets in the college. \nAnalysis of the survey results raised some key issues concerning the way digital \nresources were managed. One of the main findings was that existing digital \nasset management practices varied widely and were inconsistent across and \nbetween different departments.

This was to kick-start a critical mass of \nMETS-based projects within the UK, so ensuring that UK institutions are fully \nstandards-based in their digital object management. Based at the University of \nOxford, the project adapted and expanded existing internal METS training \nmaterials and used these in a series of six training events that:\n\u00b7 Raised   general   awareness   of   METS   and   other   closely   related \nemerging standards both within the DPAM programme and among \nthe wider community served by JISC;\n\u00b7 Provided attendees with sufficient information to assess how METS \nand related standards might contribute to their institutions\u2019 current \nand planned digital preservation and asset management activities \n\u00b7 Enabled attendees to find out more about METS for themselves and \nto prepare them for the METS tutorial workshops \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 14DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nSix non-technical events were held at locations around the UK.

Library institutions at the Universities of Oxford and Manchester \ndeveloped  a  best practice  template   and  guidelines on  issues relating  to \narchiving   and   preservation   of   such   papers,   based   in   part   on   practical \nexperiences gained during in the project in accessioning and ingesting digital \nprivate papers from contemporary British politicians into digital repositories. \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 15DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nTaking a life cycle and curatorial approach to the management and preservation \nof digital private papers, the project explored issues relating to all stages \nincluding creation, accession, ingest, metadata, storage and technical storage \nsystems,   access,   and   re-use.   Technical,   legal   (including   Freedom   of \nInformation, Data Protection, and IPR), cultural and organisational aspects were \ncovered throughout the exploration, as was the role for standards such as OAIS \nand METS. The benefits and place of collaborative approaches to this broad \nchallenge were investigated, particularly in light of the increasing number and \noutputs from international research and preservation initiatives (including work \nby a wide range of national archival institutions from around the globe). In light \nof global and potentially overlapping efforts in developing storage in different \nsectors (e.g. institutional and archival repositories), the project efforts towards \nharmonising traditional archival processed with digital object management \nprocesses have particularly wide reaching applicability in terms of improved \ncommunication and less duplication of effort across different sectors. \nThe project is still underway.

Led by the \nUniversity of Southampton in conjunction with the National Archives, the British \nLibrary and Oxford University, the project developed a pilot and shared Web \naccessible preservation-based service and supporting technologies. \nThe main deliverable of the project is the ROAR-PRONOM service. This links \nPRONOM-DROID, a web-based service from the National Archives for file \nformat identification, with the Eprints Registry of Open Access Repositories \n(ROAR) via an Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting service.\n8 This provides \ninstitutions with a so-called 'PRESERV profile' \u2013 an assessment of all formats \ncurrently held in their institutional repository. This is a first step towards \ndevelopment and implementation of preservation action and a technology watch \nservice. The project also contributed to development of the widely deployed \nEprints repository software, producing:\n1. a new history module for the EPrints repository software that records \nmetadata   describing   changes   or   actions   performed   on   an   object \n(contributing to an ability to verify an object's authenticity or integrity); \n2. application programmes to package and disseminate data for delivery \nto an external service using either METS or the MPEG-21 DIDL \nstandard;\n3. a rights declaration, allowing preservation services to be undertaken \nupon the content deposited in a repository.\nFurther outputs included: a survey of repository preservation policies, which \nalthough time-specific is a revealing insight into contemporary IR approaches to \npreservation; a subset of the PREMIS metadata data dictionary that is tailored \nspecifically towards the preservation requirements of IRs; and an extended \nmodel of potential preservation services, some of which may be addressed in \nthe project follow-up, PRESERV2.\n9\nOutputs\n8 PRONOM is an online registry of technical information - http:\/\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/pronom\/. \nDROID (Digital Record Object Identification) is a software tool developed by The National Archives to \nperform automated batch identification of file formats - \nhttp:\/\/droid.sourceforge.net\/wiki\/index.php\/Documentation .

Led   by   the \nUniversity of London Computing centre in conjunction with the UK \nDigital Preservation Coalition (DPC) and Cornell University in the US, \nthis project developed and delivered week-long residential modular \ntraining programmes that explored key issues in digital preservation \nand   examined   the   need   for   policies,   planning,   standards   and \nstrategies in digital preservation.\n\u2022 Life   cycle   Information   for   E-literature   (LIFE).      University   College \nLondon (UCL) Library Services and the British Library (BL) examined \nthe life cycles of key digital collections at UCL and established the \nindividual stages in the cycle. These stages were then costed to show \nthe full financial commitment of collecting digital materials over the \nlong term. A particularly commendable output of this project was the \nformulae and unique digital preservation equation to cost digital \npreservation activity within the life cycle model.  \n\u2022 Managing Digital Assets in Tertiary Education (MANDATE)    . John \nWheatley FE college in Glasgow developed a management toolkit to \nsupport   the   implementation   of   digital   asset   management   and \npreservation activities, notably digital learning support objects and \nofficial college records, within an FE context. The toolkit walks users \nthrough the main issues to consider in the development of a digital \nasset management system, from both a technological and a 'human' \nperspective,   and   is   supported   by   case   study   examples   of \nimplementation of the toolkit at John Wheatley College.\n\u2022 Managing   Risk:   a   Model   Business   Preservation   Strategy   for     \nCorporate Digital Assets.

Led by Oxford Digital Library, the \nMAT project ran a series of training events to raise awareness in the \nUK higher education community of the METS (Metadata Encoding \nand Transmission) standard for digital object storage within a library \nenvironment.\n\u2022 Personal   Archives   Accessible   in   Digital   Media   (PARADIGM)    . \nResearch libraries at the University of Oxford and the University of \nManchester collaborated on the PARADGM project to explore issues \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 22DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nand develop a workbook with best practice guidelines on managing \nand preserving private digital papers, based on practical investigation \nof private papers from politicians.\n\u2022 An Effective Strategic model for the Preservation & disposal of     \nInstitutional Digital Assets (ESPIDA)    .      Based at the University of \nGlasgow, ESPIDA developed a model to help make business cases \nfor funding to enable management of intangible assets, including \ndigital objects.   \nProjects commonly addressed three main areas: training, costs & business \nmodels, and case studies.\n4.1.1.1 Training\nTraining has been a significant component of this element of the programme, \nwith two projects (MAT and DPTP) focusing exclusively on development and \nprovision   of   training   for   key   aspects   of   digital   preservation   and   others \n(PARADIGM, ESPIDA and MANDATE) providing either localised training or \nmaterials that may be used for training purposes.\nTraining elements:\n\u2022 Comprehensive digital preservation training\n\u2022 METS training\n\u2022 Business case training\n\u2022 Digital Asset Management System training\nComprehensive   digital   preservation:  The   DPTP   developed   a   modular \ntraining programme with content targeted at all levels of staff from service or \nproject managers to technical and operational staff. DPTP's broader aim was to \nequip staff with the skills, tools and confidence to be able to embark on a \npragmatic and cost-effective digital preservation programme appropriate to their \nown  institutional needs, taking into  account  the practical reality that any \napproach to digital preservation is iterative and that no organisation is able to \nleap instantly into a fully formed digital preservation programme. \nAimed at multiple levels of attendee, the course brought together technical and \narchival professions to learn the same standards and methods for digital \npreservation, examining the need for policies, planning, strategies, standards \nand procedures in digital preservation. DPTP training materials are provided in \nhard copy to course delegates. The website provides an overview of the \ncontents of the course and each module.

The exercise accompanies the \nESPIDA Handbook and offers training in how to use the Handbook. It is \nenvisaged   that   the   training   exercise   could   be   used   as   a   first   step   in \nunderstanding the approach before full implementation within organisations or \ngroups wishing to use it.\n\u2022 ESPIDA training exercise   \nDigital Asset Management Systems:    The MANDATE toolkit contains a \nsection   on   training,   highlighting   the   importance   of   training   for   managers \napproaching digital asset management, including those with responsibility for \nflexible learning, library services, and quality, and technical managers. In \ndevelopment of the toolkit and in preparation for the development of a digital \nasset management system at the College, training at conceptual level was \nprovided for both administrative staff and representatives of teaching staff (ILT \nChampions), based on an early prototype intended to support this purpose and \nact as a consultation tool. The prototype allowed consultation about interface \ndesign and the fit of the system with users' understandings of their role in the \ndigital asset management workflow. The 'Guidance notes for using the asset \nmanagement prototype' were used to support this training.\n\u2022 Guidance notes for using the asset management prototype        \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 24DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n4.1.1.2 Costs & Business models\nTwo   projects   in   this   strand   focussed   on   cost   and   business   models   for \npreservation and asset management: LIFE and ESPIDA. Most other projects \nconsidered cost issues to some extent or another in the course of the project, \nbut none focussed so explicitly on cost and business models as these two.\nPreservation and digital asset management is, in every case, wholly reliant \nupon one thing: money. Projects were united in their findings that preservation \nshould not be considered as an end in itself: it should be considered within the \nlife cycle of digital object management. This is vital for appropriating the \nnecessary finances to ensure that sustainability is a consideration within life \ncycle management, and to fund preservation activities.\nModels:\n\u2022 Cost model\n\u2022 Business case model\nCost model: The LIFE project developed a methodology to calculate the long \nterm costs and future preservation requirements of digital assets. Though the \nmodel has been developed in a digital library setting, there is no reason to \nbelieve that elements of the model are not transferable to other contexts. The \nmethodology is life cycle based and scalable (though the extent to which this \nremains true has not yet been established). The preservation aspect of the \nmodel is particularly valuable as most other work on preservation costing has \napproached the subject in isolation, rather than how it is integrated into overall \nlife cycle management. \n\u2022 LIFE project final report     (breakdown of cost model and approach, pp \n9 \u2013 16)\nBusiness case model:  The model that ESPIDA developed can help make \nbusiness cases for proposals that may not necessarily offer immediate financial \nbenefit to an organisation, but rather bring benefit in more intangible spheres. \nThe ESPIDA approach offers advantages to both decision-makers and project \nproposers in terms of understanding proposals, ensuring the decision-making \nprocess is transparent and based on all relevant information, and allows both \nsets   of   stakeholders   to   communicate   effectively,   ultimately   benefiting   the \norganisation. While it was designed initially to be used within the area of digital \nresource management, it has potential for far wider application (decision \nmaking, performance measurement, change management).

Case \nstudies are incredibly valuable. In some circumstances, they provide a basis on \nwhich to test and refine a given theory or approach. In others, they can be used \nto demonstrate to the wider community how an approach was implemented in a \ngiven context. This can give rise to several practical issues that may otherwise \nnot  be  obvious  to  new  implementers.  In  many cases, case  studies  can \naccomplish both of these outcomes, acting both as test cases AND as learning \ntools for others. Almost every project in this funding strand drew upon case \nstudies during the course of the project. The prevalence of case studies within \nthis strand illustrates a keen desire on the behalf of participants to encourage \nand assist in broader implementation of project outputs. Case studies covered:\n\u2022 Digital asset management in an FE setting\n\u2022 Digital asset management in an HE setting\n\u2022 Costing of digital library collections\n\u2022 Metadata implementation in digital libraries\n\u2022 Archival collection development\n\u2022 Developing a business case to support intangible assets\nDigital asset management in an FE setting:  MANDATE is an outstanding \nexample of how case studies can function both as test scenarios against which \nto   develop   and   refine   an   approach   and   also   as   practical   examples   of \nimplementation from which others can glean valuable learning experiences. \nEach chapter of the MANDATE toolkit is supplemented by a case study \ndescription   of   implementation   experiences   at   John   Wheatley   college   that \ndemonstrates how the toolkit was applied and shows how and why decisions \nwere made to support any given activity. Textual descriptions are supported by \ngraphics and tables, including screen shots of the prototype system and \nworkflow models, and several links to supporting or college documentation are \nintegrated into the study. MANDATE staff at John Wheatley intend to update the \nsystem once the system is actually up and running.

Although preservation activities were not \nundertaken in any of the case studies, the studies were fundamental in shaping \nthe specific and required elements of the preservation aspect of the model.\n\u2022 LIFE project\n\u2022 VDEP Case study     (final report, pp 17 \u2013 51)\n\u2022 Web archiving case study     (final report, pp 52 \u2013 63)\n\u2022 UCL e-journals case study     (final report, pp 64 \u2013 87)\n\u2022 VDEP Preservation model   \n\u2022 Web Arc preservation model   \nMetadata implementation in digital libraries: case studies were used as a \nvaluable learning tool in the METS Awareness training project.

This   enabled   them   to   make   important \nrecommendations   on   approaching   and   developing   collection   development \npolicies and strategies, though the project ultimately recommended that more \ncase studies are needed, particularly those that test different approaches or \nwhich address different domains. One primary case study was carried out, \nsupplemented by two pilots. The primary case study involved identifying, \ncapturing, and transferring records from contemporary politicians. This was \nsupported by two pilot investigations. It led to a series of recommendations on \nhow this valuable historical resource could be targeted for preservation. The \nstudy was supported by two complimentary pilot projects, one examining how \npolitical web resources could be targeted, the other exploring the issues in \naccessioning digital deposits from physical storage media. Project staff worked \nwith the archive of Barbara Castle, which included two old PCs and a range of \nAmstrad disks \u2013 this was an archive deposited in the old-fashioned way (most \nof it is paper \u2013 some 500 boxes) and we worked with the BL on using forensic \ncomputing techniques to extract faithful images of the hard disks. \n\u2022 Case study 1 - Hybrid personal archives of working politicians     (final \nreport, pp16 - 20)\n\u2022 Case study 2 - Web archiving pilot     (final report, p23)\n\u2022 Case study 3 - Digital archaeology pilot     (final report, p24)\nDeveloping a business case to support intangible assets: A number of case \nstudies were undertaken as part of the development of the ESPIDA approach, \nand as an aid to deeper understanding of the work and its applicability.  The \ncase studies demonstrate how the ESPIDA approach can be used in different \nscenarios and explore some examples that may hold some resonance for areas \nwithin HE\/FE. Three case studies were undertaken, testing the model on an e-\ntheses collection, an IR, and a museums collection. The studies were created \nwith the help of stakeholders within and external to the University of Glasgow. \nWhilst based on real life scenarios, the studies are for explanatory purposes \nonly and are not actual business cases.\nFor the Institutional Repository study, the project team that had developed the \nUniversity\u2019s own repository helped explore the benefits and so-called 'dis-\nbenefits' that can arise from setting up a repository to manage and disseminate \nacademic outputs. The cost elements of this study are based on an example \nfrom Edinburgh University Library.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 28DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe eTheses study examines how three different options can be appraised \nusing the ESPIDA Scorecards.

A \nsingle project was funded:\n\u2022 Digital Asset Assessment Tool (DAAT)    . The University of London \nComputing   Centre   together   with   seven   other   project   partners \nexplored the extensibility and development of the existing analogue-\nbased Preservation Assessment Survey (PAS) tool from the National \nPreservation   Office   (PAS)   for   assessment   of   preservation \nrequirements of digital materials in a given collection. \nPreservation risk assessment:  Although no final tool for this task was \nultimately released, a pilot database system that reworks the PAS tool for digital \nassets   was   delivered.   Furthermore,   the   project   carried   out   a   number   of \ncomprehensive surveys and assessments of existing assessment tools for other \nareas of digital asset management, particularly ingest. The risk-based element \nof the project clearly links to the Managing Risk project funded under the \nprevious strand, although the two projects explored very different mechanisms \nfor identifying risks (one manual, the other automated). \n\u2022 Pilot D-PAS database tool   \n\u2022 Guidance on using the tool   \n\u2022 Assessment of risk factors   \n\u2022 File format tools report   \n4.1.3 Institutional Repository Infrastructure Development \nIn   recognition   of   the   very   clear   link   between   digital   asset   management, \npreservation, and repository storage, a further three projects were funded to \nexplore institutional repository infrastructure development, particularly standards \nand shared repository services:\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 29DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 Assessment   of   UK   Data   Archive   and   The   National   Archives     \ncompliance with OAIS\/METS. The UK Data Archive at the University \nof Essex explored compliance of two national repositories with two \nsignificant   (though   with   very   different   foci)   standards   used   in \npreservation: the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) repository \nreference model and the METS metadata encoding transmission \nstandard.\n\u2022 PReservation Eprint SERVices (PRESERV)    . Led by the University of \nSouthampton, the PRESERV project explored a number of web-\nbased preservation services for institutional repositories (IRs) and \nprovided input to the development of preservation functionality within \nthe institutional repository software package EPrints.\n\u2022 SHERPA Digital Preservation: Creating a Persistent Preservation     \nEnvironment for Institutional Repositories (SHERPA DP). The Arts \nand   Humanities   Data   Service   (AHDS)   worked   closely   with   the \nSHERPA project at the University of Nottingham to bring existing \nrepository systems in the SHERPA IR network together with the \nAHDS preservation repository and create an environment that fully \naddresses the requirements of digital information objects across their \nentire life cycle.\nThe PARADIGM project (see section 2.1) received additional funding under this \nstrand for its activities in practical testing of repository software and related \ntools, as well as its use of the OAIS work flow model.   \nWhilst   aspects   of   each   project   clearly   relate   to   strand   activities   already \ndiscussed (such as assessment and case studies), a key element of this \nprogramme   strand   is   the   focus   on   technical   and   functional   repository \ninfrastructures for long term preservation. Both the UKDA and the TNA have \narchival   repositories   that   cater   for   long   term   preservation;   the   AHDS \npreservation   repository   and   preservation   service   has   a   clear   long   term \npreservation objective, and the PRESERV project had an explicit commitment \nto explore long term digital preservation within the context of institutional \nrepositories. \nMain aspects:\n\u2022 Software\n\u2022 Standards\n\u2022 Shared services\n4.1.3.1 Open source repository software for long term preservation\nNone of the projects explicitly set out to assess the suitability of given repository \nsoftware package for long term preservation. However, PRESERV, SHERPA \nDP and PARADIGM all explored aspects of certain repository packages within \ntheir preservation or life cycle research.\n\u2022 EPrints\n\u2022 DSpace\n\u2022 Fedora\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 30DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nEprints: Eprints is an established, flexible software infrastructure that is used to \nstore and provide access to a wide range of digital materials in institutions \naround the world. It was not designed with long term preservation in mind; the \nemphasis is on Open Access. The PRESERV project was focused particularly \non preservation services using Eprints software. It did not aim to make Eprints \ninto a long term preservation infrastructure, but to enable Eprints IRs to deliver \nmaterials with the necessary information for preservation specialists to provide \nthose   services.   The   PRESERV   project   investigated   means   for   improving \nsupport for the OAIS Ingest and the Archival Store functions in Eprints-based \nIRs and developed a small number of plug-ins so that support for these services \ncan be provided in real IRs. Three such features have been integrated into \nEprints v3:\n\u2022 Complex-Object Export: METS and DIDL plug-ins        \n\u2022 History Module        \n\u2022 Preservation Rights Declaration        \nThe SHERPA DP project aimed to develop services for use by a network of \ninstitutional repositories, including Eprints installations.

The primary objective was to \nidentify data migration mechanisms that may be suitable for the SHERPA DP \nArchive-to-AHDS (Preservation Service) data transfer.\n\u2022 Architectural review of Eprints software   \nDSpace: The DSpace digital repository system was designed to capture, store, \nindex, preserve, and provide access to institutional digital research materials. \nAs such, it is said to offer more immediate support for preservation than the \nEPrints system, although in practice this is debatable. \nThe SHERPA DP team carried out an architectural review of the DSpace \nsoftware that investigated the data model and export interfaces used by \nDSpace. The primary objective was to identify data migration mechanisms that \nmay be suitable for the SHERPA DP Archive-to-AHDS (Preservation Service) \ndata transfer, four of which were identified. \n\u2022 Architectural review of DSpace software   \nThe PARADIGM project workbook contains a detailed description of the project \nteam's experiences in setting up a DSpace repository.

It is more complex to install and manage than \nDSpace and Eprints, but is often preferred for more complex activities than \ncommonly undertaken within an institutional repository setting.\nThe SHERPA DP project adopted Fedora as the basis for the preservation \nrepository and built a technical infrastructure necessary to harvest metadata, \ntransfer data, and perform relevant preservation activities.

Standard \nterminology   allows   existing   and   future   archives   to   be   more   meaningfully \ncompared and contrasted. It also provides a basis for further standardisation \nwithin an archival context and it should promote greater vendor awareness of, \nand support of, archival requirements. The OAIS reference model became an \nISO standard in 2003.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 32DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe model has been widely seized upon by the archival and preservation \ncommunities and several institutions now claim compliance with the model. Yet \nthe reference is model is not a precise specification and functionality of existing \nsystems can be mapped against the OAIS model to varying levels. 'Compliance' \ncan therefore mean different things to different organisations. \nThe OAIS\/METS Assessment project sought to explore in detail what is meant \nby compliance and to assess whether two existing systems \u2013 the UKDA and the \nsystem in place at TNA \u2013 can be meaningfully deemed 'compliant'. In addition to \na comprehensive assessment of compliance, the project delivered a useful \nchecklist   for   other   institutions   to   use   in   assessing   their   own   levels   of \ncompliance:\n\u2022 A set of questions for OAIS compliance self-testing     (pp 105 \u2013 107)\nSHERPA   DP   used   the   OAIS   reference   model   to   develop   a   persistent \npreservation environment for the SHERPA consortium, assigning rights and \nresponsibilities and establishing protocols and work flow processes that will \nensure the long-term preservation of the repository content. An objective of the \nSHERPA DP project was to ensure that institutional repositories could be \nconsidered OAIS compliant. The final SHERPA DP model is essentially a \nmodified version of an OAIS. The services provided by institutional repositories \nare mapped to the OAIS reference model and notable omissions identified and \nallocated to the preservation service. \nThe project delivered a report on an OAIS compliant model for disaggregated \nservices to be delivered as part of the SHERPA DP project, including an \nassessment of the suitability of the reference model as a practical model. The \nhandbook contains a useful overview of the OAIS framework and discussion of \nOAIS compliance, based in part on the investigations carried out as part of the \nOAIS\/METS project. \n\u2022 SHERPA DP Handbook: an OAIS compliant model for disaggregated \nservices ()\nThe PARADIGM workbook has extensive information on the OAIS model, \nincluding some examples of how the model can work in practice. The section \ndoes not relate extensively to long term preservation, though it is a useful \noverview with links to related initiatives including compliance and certification.\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: section on the OAIS model   \nPREMIS: PREMIS is a de facto metadata schema standard for preservation \nmetadata. The PREMIS data dictionary specifies core metadata for verifying \nand tracking the provenance, authenticity and integrity of preserved digital \nassets.\nPARADIGM explored the use of PREMIS metadata within METS files and the \nworkbook contains a section on using PREMIS\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: section on PREMIS   \nSHERPA   DP   adopted   the   PREMIS   data   dictionary   as   the   basis   for   its \npreservation metadata schema. The project identified refinements necessary to \nsupport the operation of the preservation service. The broad requirements of \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 33DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nPREMIS were further supplement by format-specific metadata (e.g. MIX for \nimage metadata), as appropriate. \nPRESERV explored the use of PREMIS within an IR context. It found that \nPREMIS appeared to provide an excellent basis on which assess the needs of \nIRs with respect to preservation metadata, and it was possible to map the \nPREMIS elements to an extended model incorporating preservation services \nand   registries.   However,   more   implementation   and   testing   are   required, \nespecially   to   validate   the   allocation   of   elements   to   preservation   service \nproviders and environment registries.\n\u2022 Preservation   Metadata   for   Institutional   Repositories:   applying     \nPREMIS\nMetadata   Encoding   and   Transmission   Standard   (METS):  The   METS \nschema is a de facto standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and \nstructural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using an \nXML Schema. The METS standard has been proposed as a suitable vehicle to \nsupport transfer and dissemination of objects for preservation by an external \nservice   provider,   particularly   in   the   case   of   complex   objects   (i.e.   those \ncomprising more than one file). \nThe OAIS\/METS Awareness project considered the METS metadata standard, \nhow it could be used further in a digital archive and its potential role at the \nNational Archives and in the UKDA. The project found that METS documents \n(i.e. instances of METS in practice) are compatible with the OAIS model but \nthat,   particularly   for   born   digital   material,   there   was   no   clear   benefit   in \nimplementing METS in the test repositories at this moment in time. The \nstrengths and weaknesses of METS and its applicability within an archival \nenvironment are discussed in more detail in the project final report:\n\u2022 OAIS\/METS Awareness final report: C7 Using the METS metadata     \nstandard in a digital archive (pp 71 \u2013 80)\nThe PARADIGM workbook section on administrative and preservation metadata \ncontains a detailed introduction to METS and its use within a digital archive \nsetting. The project developed specific guidance for users implementing METS \nin a digital archive setting, including advice on dealing with problems ingesting \nMETS files into Fedora:\n\u2022 Designing a METS Schema ()\n\u2022 Sample METS Schema(s) for Personal Papers ()\n\u2022 Troubleshooting METS files and Fedora's Directory Ingest Service   \nPRESERV released a METS export plug-in derived from work done by the \nRepository Bridge project, who implemented a METS export for EPrints 2. This \nwas updated for the new plug-in architecture and data model in EPrints 3. \n\u2022 Complex-Object Export: METS plug-in        \nMPEG-DIDL:  Similarly to METS, the de facto standard MPEG-DIDL (Digital \nItem Declaration Language) has also been proposed as a suitable vehicle to \nsupport transfer and dissemination of complex objects for preservation by an \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 34DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nexternal service provider. PRESERV developed an MPEG DIDL plug-in to \npackage data for delivery to an external service that has since been integrated \ninto Eprints v3.\n\u2022 Complex-Object Export: DIDL plug-in        \n4.1.3.3 Shared services for long term preservation\nShared infrastructure services are essential building blocks for an efficient and \neffective   information   and   communications   environment.\n10  PRESERV   and \nSHERPA   DP   both   explored   or   developed   shared   services   for   long-term \npreservation.\n\u2022 Format profiling\n\u2022 Preservation Service Provider\nFormat profiling: The PRESERV project investigated long-term preservation \nfor institutional repositories (IRs), by exploring the capacity for preservation \nservices in conjunction with specialists, such as national libraries and archives \nand developing a web-based service for identifying the format of repository \ncontents. One of the most widely recognised problems in preserving digital \ninformation is format obsolescence: as applications change over time to exploit \nthe capabilities of new technology, digital objects created using old formats, or \neven old versions of formats, can become unreadable and the content and \nauthenticity of a digital object is therefore at risk. One approach to this problem \nis to migrate the original format to a current, readable version. By knowing the \nformats of all objects in a repository, preservation strategies can be planned \nand action taken at the appropriate time on those objects that may otherwise be \nat risk of becoming obsolete. The need for accurate identification of the format \nof original source objects if often therefore at the centre of much digital \npreservation activity.\nPRESERV worked with The National Archives to link the widely renowned \nPRONOM-DROID tool for file format identification to the widely used Registry of \nOpen Access Repositories (ROAR) through an OAI harvesting service. As a \nresult, file format profiles can be found for over 200 repositories listed in ROAR. \nThis service \u2013 that identifies the file formats stored within a repository \u2013 is the \nfirst step in a more fully fledged technology watch service whereby \u2018at-risk\u2019 \nformats are subsequently flagged and acted upon and has been termed the \nPRONOM-ROAR format profiling service.\nContinued provision and development of the web-based service is not a \ncertainty: the service is considered a demonstrator, it is not explicitly funded and \nwill require some maintenance. The code for the demonstrator has however \nbeen deposited in the local eprints repository.\n\u2022 Digital   Preservation   Service   Provider   Models   for   Institutional     \nRepositories: towards distributed services\n\u2022 PRESERV Format Profiling: PRONOM-ROAR: An illustrated guide   \n\u2022 Public PRESERV profiles available via the ROAR website   \n10  JISC   Shared   Infrastructure   Services   Synthesis   report,   Chapman   and   Russell   (2006) \nhttp:\/\/www.jisc.ac.uk\/media\/documents\/programmes\/capital\/jisc-sis-report-final.pdf.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 35DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 Institutional repository preservation contexts   \nPreservation   Service   Provider:  The   SHERPA   DP   project   developed   a \npractical and cost effective shared service system for performing preservation \nactivities for a distributed network of institutional repositories. It created a \ndemonstrator   for   a   Preservation   Service   Provider   and   established   the \nassociated technical infrastructure and business model to support the project. \nThe model developed by the project identified two types of institution \u2013 Content \nProviders and Service Providers - that perform different tasks in the workflow. \nThe institutional repositories participating in the project served as Content \nProviders, taking responsibility for accepting data and making it available to \ntheir user community. The Service Provider, in turn, takes responsibility for the \nlong-term   management   of   the   digital   objects,   essentially   serving   as   a \ncentralised \u201cdark archive\u201d. \nThe most notable development of the Preservation Service demonstrator was \nthe creation of a reusable service framework that allows the integration of a \ndisparate collection of software tools and standards. The project adopted \nFedora as the basis for the preservation repository and built a technical \ninfrastructure   necessary   to   harvest   metadata,   transfer   data,   and   perform \nrelevant preservation activities. Appropriate software tools and standards were \nselected, including JHOVE and DROID as software tools to validate data \nobjects; METS as a packaging standard; and PREMIS as a basis on which to \ncreate preservation metadata.\nThe demonstrator established during the project will continue to archive data \nmade available by SHERPA DP partner institutions for a minimum of one year. \nFurther investigation is necessary to establish a broader and more sustainable \nframework of repository services. The Preservation Service, as defined by the \nproject proposal, performed  preservation  activities for   a  small  number  of \ninstitutional repositories operating the EPrints and DSpace repository software. \nHowever it found it unlikely that the revenue generated by e-print archives will \nbe sufficient to support a full preservation service. A new need may be identified \nfor the provision of preservation services to repositories that are responsible for \na wider range of content types.\n\u2022 SHERPA DP Preservation Handbook Part II: A disaggregated model \nfor preservation service: the SHERPA DP approach ()\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 36DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n5 Thematic overviews\n5.1.1 Asset types\n\u2022 Corporate & Institutional administrative records\n\u2022 ePrint deposits\n\u2022 Datasets\n\u2022 eJournals\n\u2022 Web resources\n\u2022 eLearning materials\n\u2022 Private papers\nCorporate & Institutional administrative records: Managing Risk, MANDATE \nand ESPIDA considered corporate and institutional records within the wider and \nmore generic focus on corporate digital assets. \nManaging Risk surveyed existing approaches to managing corporate digital \nassets - electronic business records (including meetings\u2019 records, student files \nand office correspondence) and research material in electronic form -  within \nKCL and the risks involved in current asset management practices. MANDATE \nexplored development of a develop a digital asset management strategy \nsupporting flexible access to learning and teaching materials, and publication of \ndocuments   supporting   a   pro-active   approach   to   Freedom   of   Information \nlegislation principles, and; ESPIDA investigated requirements for preservation \nof institutional records (though this was not the focus of their work). Each \nproject resulted in valuable insight into the requirements of corporate and \ninstitutional records. \nThe MANDATE survey was extended to five departments and covered two \ntypes of digital assets:\n\u2022 Unstructured assets \u2013collections of documents held in digital form \n(word processed documents, spreadsheets etc.) \u2013 (termed \u2018Record \nCollections\u2019 in survey material provided to users).\n\u2022 Structured assets \u2013databases of information \nIt found that only around 20% of record collections were held in digital form and \nonly 5% of these needed permanent preservation, though it recognised that this \nnumber may have been higher if the survey had been more comprehensive. \nThe Managing Risk survey found that for administrative records, paper records \ncontinued to be the definitive versions. It remained common to print out \nelectronic records \u2013 particularly emails \u2013 and save them in hard copy. There \nwere recurring problems with version control and currency, especially in relation \nto research grant applications and ethics forms, and inconsistent application of \npractices,   both   good   and   bad,   across   different   departments.   Data   was \ncommonly duplicated in central departments and in schools. This may be \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 37DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nappropriate in some cases but in others it led to dispersed records with no \nsingle authoritative source. Overall, the project found that in general far more \nwork is needed in identifying the archival needs of electronic records and in \nsupporting their long-term retention and use.\n\u2022 Managing Risk final report   \nMANDATE focussed on the development of a strategy and implementation of a \nsystem for digital asset management. It focussed on assets relevant to its core \nbusiness, and to prioritise learning and teaching materials and documents \nsupporting proactive FoI disclosure. In an effort to provide the widest possible \nsupport for the distinct ways of accessing the different types of asset stored, the \ncollege decided to develop separate upload interfaces for each type of asset. \nThe specific asset types identified were:\n\u2022 college publications,\n\u2022 papers associated with college meetings,\n\u2022 internal and external learning materials,\n\u2022 quality process monitoring documents.\nPrior to the MANDATE project, college assets were held in a combination of \nphysical and digital formats and in different locations. The digital format used in \nthe creation of documents was and remains Microsoft Word - on the whole \nthese assets were distributed by administrative staff as physical documents. A \nstrategic decision was made to use the PDF format for the publication of text \ndocuments (both College publications and learning and teaching materials). The \nselection of PDF as the preferred format for publishing college documents was \npartly taken in light of preservation issues. It was felt that such a common \nstandard is very likely to remain accessible for the foreseeable future and \nissues relating to longer-term access (such as transfer to new formats) will be \nwell catered for because of its widespread use. A survey of college retention \nrequirements revealed that approximately 14% of the record classes required \npermanent preservation. \n\u2022 MANDATE final report   \nESPIDA  sought to develop and implement a sustainable business-focussed \nmodel for digital preservation as part of a wider knowledge management \nagenda in HE institutions. Part of their initial activities included a survey of \ncollege administrative records to identify records of longer term value that \nrequired   preservation.   The   results   were   somewhat   surprising,   for   most \nrespondents indicated they did not hold records of longer term value that \nrequired preservation.\n11 This finding is consistent with that of the Managing Risk \nproject,   though   perhaps  not   as   much   as   the   MANDATE   project.   It   was \nfundamental in shaping the future direction of the project to focus more broadly \non a model for developing a business case to support intangible activities.\n11 Conversation with project officers, February 2007.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 38DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nePrint deposits:  SHERPA DP and PRESERV considered management and \npreservation   of   ePrint   deposits   within   the   broader   context   of   institutional \nrepositories.   As   such,   the   focus   was   on   the   infrastructure   surrounding \nmanagement and preservation of the assets rather than an exploration of the \nassets themselves. Both SHERPA DP and PRESERV addressed the subject of \npreservation metadata for eprints within an IR, but no project explored other \naspects of ePrint deposits in detail. \nSHERPA DP defined a refined set of metadata elements considered essential \nfor preservation of e-prints provided by institutional repositories. The PREMIS \nData Dictionary served as a basis on which to build an appropriate metadata \nscheme. \n\u2022 SHERPA handbook: metadata model for ePrints ()\nPRESERV   explored   how   PREMIS   can   be   applied   within   an   Institutional \nRepository setting. As PREMIS is based on the idea of implementation, staff \nsought to develop an implementation involving institutional repositories (IRs). \nTheir analysis mapped the five entity types identified in the PREMIS Data \nDictionary - intellectual entities, objects, events, agents and rights - to potential \nmetadata sources identified in an IR-preservation service provider model. It \nfound that PREMIS appeared to provide an excellent basis on which assess the \nneeds of IRs with respect to preservation metadata, though some elements may \nneed to be adapted or omitted and more implementation and testing is required. \n\u2022 Preservation Metadata for Institutional Repositories: applying     \nPREMIS\nDatasets:  Datasets are commonly found within institutions and have a wide \narray of uses, including administrative records, and collection\/compilation of \nresearch data and statistics. The OAIS\/METS Assessment and Managing Risks \nprojects both explored issues surrounding the management and preservation of \ndatasets. \nOAIS\/METS Assessment did not explore in detail the particular requirements of \ndatabase   systems,   concentrating   instead   on   assessing   the   standard \ninfrastructure by which the systems were preserved. \nManaging Risk, on the other hand, made a number of discoveries about the \nway in which datasets were managed whilst in their active phase. The survey \nrevealed that legacy database systems still hold important data and that \nalthough software is regularly upgraded and\/or superseded, data isn\u2019t always \nmigrated onto new systems. In some cases it continues to be trapped in and \naccessed through older variants. Furthermore, management of research data \nsets is inconsistent across different departments. The survey found excellent \npractice in some areas: technically adept teams managed their data assets well, \nbut in other areas data management was poor. In one case personal data was \nbeing stored carelessly raising a legal compliance risk. In another case backup \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 39DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nprovision was inadequate, threatening the viability of the whole study. Over half \nof the databases identified were small systems that contained data without long \nterm preservation requirements. A more pressing concern was, in fact, that data \nwas being kept longer than necessary and potentially contravening Data \nProtection or FoI. Finally, the survey indicated that long term retention of \nresearch data remains an issue for a minority of datasets. Some data sets have \nreal archival value and they could be retained indefinitely for ongoing research \nuse, but the data needs to be identified and appraised early to ensure effective \nand efficient preservation and this is not yet taking place. \n\u2022 Managing Risk: Final report   \neJournals: the preservation and management of eJournals is a recognised \narea of concern within the publishing and library communities. Until recently, \nlittle substantial and quantifiable work had been done to address the cost of \nmanaging and preserving eJournals. The LIFE project contributed extensively to \nthis gap in knowledge, refining and testing its life cycle costing formula against \nan eJournal collection at UCL (University College London) library. It undertook \nan exploration of the life cycle stages for eJournals at UCL, from acquisition to \npreservation and produced two case studies in eJournals management at UCL. \nIt also tested and refined the model against a collection at the British Library of \nVoluntarily Deposited Electronic Publications (VDEP), which is comprised of \nmonographs and serials. This collection is considered comparable with an \neJournal collection: although most are not, strictly speaking, academic journals, \nthe file formats and modes of publication are similar enough for the collection to \nbe an effective comparator for a collection of electronic journals.\nThe main study at UCL addressed the corpus of works from the Public Library \nof Science (PLoS). Examination of the file formats in the collection indicated \nthat none of the file formats in existence in the collection had actually become \nobsolete   (i.e.   were   no   longer   accessible   because   they   were   no   longer \nsupported). However, some were certainly aging, if still widely supported by \nsoftware. \u2018A good example of this is .gif files. GIF files have been the most-\nwidely used of web graphic formats, but they are widely deprecated because of \ntheir proprietary nature. They are also an old file format (1989) and use of the \nPNG (Portable Network Graphic) [format] has been advocated instead; they \nhave also been used in digital preservation Case Studies as an \u201cobsolete\u201d file \nformat before.\n12 GIF files account for about 5.26% of the collection with a total of \n455 files.\u2019\n13 The age of the collection is not specified, though the study does \nspecify that the collection comprises 30 issues and that issues are published \nmonthly; we can therefore estimate the age of the collection at no more than 3 \nyears   old   when   the   study   was   undertaken   (Summer   2005).   It   is   not \nunreasonable to think that if the collection were more dated then an increased \nnumber of obsolete files may have been found. \nBased on experiences with the UCL collection, the team found that the cost for \nthe acquisition, ingest, metadata creation, access, storage and preservation of \nUCL\u2019s e-journals over 1 year is a range of \u00a3206.87 - \u00a3559.19 per title.

Desk based research estimated the figure to be a total of \u00a32,189.83 for \nyears 1 \u2013 5 (i.e. for the whole five years, not per year) and \u00a33,052.74 for years 6 \n\u2013 10. Note however that, as service-led organisation, UCL is not responsible for \ningest, storage or preservation functions and that access to the e-journal \ncontent is via the remote publisher\u2019s server. Consequently, no costs are \nallocated for these activities. In terms of staffing activity performed on the e-\njournal content, the most expensive activity in terms of costs are those actions \nconcerned with making the materials accessible to users. \n\u2022 LIFE final report: Case study on eJournals     (pp 64 \u2013 89) \nThe LIFE VDEP case study is comparable in terms of file formats and \nobsolescence findings, although costing is significantly more complex as the \nVDEP collection is comprised on four different types material: hand held \nmonographs; hand-held serials; electronic monographs; and electronic serials.\nThe average cost for each over periods of 1, 5 and 10 years is reproduced in \nthe table below:\nType & Average cost (\u00a3) Yr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10\nAverage   cost   for   hand \nheld e-mono\n19.49 37.41 48.12\nAverage   cost   for   hand \nheld serial\n19.45 12.53 14.68\nAverage cost for e-mono 15.01 24.36 30.77\nAverage cost for e-serial 22.72 8.55 8.99\n\u2022 LIFE final report: Case study on VDEPs     (pp 17 \u2013 51) \nWeb resources: Archiving and preservation of web resources has been a point \nof international attention from the cultural heritage community for the past \ndecade. Most activities have concentrated on technical solutions, supplemented \nby occasional works on the larger life-cycle perspective.\n14  The LIFE project \ncontributed substantially to this gap in knowledge by refining and testing its life \ncycle costing formula against the web archive collection at the British Library. \nThe   PARADIGM   project   also   addressed   web   archiving,   though   from   the \nperspective of archiving personal web resources such as personal sites and \nblogs. \nThe LIFE project findings were developed from the BL web archive, which is \npart of a wider initiative - the UK Web Archiving Consotrium (UKWAC). \nActivities at the BL began in 2004 and they currently archive around 1000 \nwebsite instances per year. The web archiving case study provides an excellent \n14  See for example Adrian Brown, \u2018Archiving Websites: a practical guide for information professionals\u2019 \n(Facet publishing, 2006)\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 41DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\noverview of the specific activities involved in the web archiving process and life \ncycle,  which,  although   broadly  consistent  across  different  collections,  are \ntailored to the requirements of each collection type. An assessment of file types \nin the collection showed that whilst the majority were understandably and \nexpectedly HTML files, a considerable number of image and text files and \nformat types were present, alongside much smaller numbers of multimedia \nobjects. The variety of file fypes and their interdependent structural relationships \nhave obvious implications on any web preservation strategy, in that the strategy \nmust cater for a broad range of file and format types whilst maintaining the \nstructural relationships and dependencies of the collection that, when rendered, \nallow users to access a complete object. \nApplying the LIFE costing model to the Web Archiving Case Study involved a \nsignificant   amount   of   estimation   (e.g.   in   terms   of   staff   time,   identifying \nproportions of time spent dealing with web resources alone, and preservation \nactivities) and so the results should be considered only a very rough guide to \nthe potential costs of preserving web materials. The study indicated relatively \nhigh costs in the first year (\u00a3493.17 per instance), likely due to the high effort \nrequired   for   the   initial   collection   and   assessment.   This   drops   with   each \nsubsequent measurement, to \u00a3183.04 after five years, \u00a3128.83 after ten years, \nand \u00a380.88 after twenty years. It anticipated that costs will continue to fall as \nmore automated preservation tools are developed and source file formats \nbecome more stable. The study also suggested that a number of services can \nbe shared (e.g. performing technology watch, selecting appropriate preservation \nstrategies, and recording preservation metadata (representation information)), \nthus further reducing costs.\n15\n\u2022 LIFE final report: Case study on Web Archiving (pp 52 \u2013 63)     \nThe PARADIGM web archiving pilot was run in conjunction with the UK Web \nArchiving Consortium (UKWAC) and London School of Economics. It involved \ntaking snapshots of websites and blogs daily during the run-up to the General \nElection in 2005. Staff found that that obtaining permission to archive websites \nwas \u2018a time consuming, and often fruitless, task. Obtaining permission from the \npoliticians   with   whom   PARADIGM   had   existing   relationships   was   more \nsuccessful than approaching politicians with whom there had been no previous \ncontact, though permission was obtained from some additional politicians.\u2019\n16 \nDespite   this,   acquiring   websites   was   considered   less   complicated   that \npreserving and providing access to them, as websites are highly complex \nobjects. The project therefore recommended that research libraries consider \ncooperation   with   a   central   web   archive   rather   than   attempt   the   activity \nthemselves. \n\u2022 PARADIGM final report: Web Archiving pilot\nE-learning materials: e-learning materials are as much a type of digital asset \nas more traditional research and administrative records, yet comparatively little \n15 It is important to note that the Web Archiving activities of UKWAC are considered to be experimental. As \nmore experience is developed, software becomes more stable and gathering activity is scaled up, then \nefficiency should dramatically increase and costs will again fall.\n16PARADIGM final report.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 42DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nattention has been paid to their management and preservation. This may be \ndue to the relatively short period for which they remain valuable and re-usable: \nmany learning materials need to be frequently updated in order to remain \ncompatible with cutting edge research and teaching. Despite this, the materials \nstill have value (albeit if not enduring) for the short term and for wider \ndistribution and use by colleagues.\n17 \nThe MANDATE project explored the management of digital earning materials \nwithin   a   broader   digital   asset   management   system   that   also   contained \ndocuments relating to college governance. Microsoft Word is commonly used to \ncreate textual digital documents. On the whole these assets were distributed by \nadministrative staff as physical documents. Some were held and distributed by \nteaching staff in common network storage areas and using folders in the \ninstitutional communications system. A strategic decision was made to use the \nPDF format for the publication of text documents (both College publications and \nlearning and teaching materials). Other formats used for learning materials are \nalready stored on web servers (e.g. National Learning Network materials, where \nthe system stores metadata records and links to the assets rather than storing \nthem independently). The end system designed for use at John Wheatley caters \nfor the upload of newer file formats for learning materials such as PowerPoint \npresentations (likely to be used), images, audio, and video (not currently used \nextensively).\nInsofar as preservation is concerned, the study found that \u2018in a Further \nEducation (FE) setting a commitment to preservation is likely to be assessed in \nhow it relates to the core business of the college and its legal and cultural \nobligations. A meaningful preservation commitment for an FE college is likely to \nbe less than a decade. Beyond such a period materials are no longer required \nfor business use or legal obligation for the college and the only likely motivation \nfor preservation is to cater for unspecified future historical interest. Materials \nmay not necessarily be deleted (or physically destroyed) after this period, but \nactive curation is beyond the funded remit of the college. Preservation of \ninformation assets beyond obligation is likely to be an attractive option for a \ncollege only where there is little or no cost involved. Their use and value would \nnow be more the preserve of national memory institutions.\u2019 College policy \nregarding preservation of learning and teaching materials in the new system is \nconsistent with this statement and staff have decided that there is no point in \nretaining learning materials beyond the life of the teaching unit to which they are \nattached.\nExternally acquired learning materials licensed for use on College servers are \navailable only to enrolled users, although the metadata records about them are \nmore widely accessible via the web interface and, at a later stage, the \ncatalogue. Internally produced learning materials are only available to enrolled \nusers. \n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Case Study on John Wheatley College   \n17 The JORUM repository is a typical example of this value. Jorum is a JISC-funded collaborative venture \nin UK Higher and Further Education to collect and share learning and teaching materials, allowing their \nreuse and repurposing, and standing as a national statement of the importance of creating interoperable, \nsustainable materials. See http:\/\/www.jorum.ac.uk\/. \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 43DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nPrivate papers: Whilst the management and preservation of official institutional \nor corporate records has been an issue for several years now, the particular \ncontext and preservation requirements of personal archives have attracted little \nattention. The difference can be generalised across two main themes:\n\u2022 From a technical and management perspective: personal archives \nare created and managed by individuals using a variety of standards, \ntools, and technologies over which the archivist has little or no direct \ninfluence and which are often not optimised for preservation. This \ncompounds the preservation challenge, particularly as preservation is \nnot addressed until much later in the life cycle, and preservation is \nbest addressed as early in the life cycle as possible.\n\u2022 From a legal perspective: permission to preserve or provide access to \nthe collection is not always straightforward to identify and\/or obtain. \nSeveral parties may have particular privacy or intellectual property \nrights. This means that different parts of the collection will often have \ndifferent legal requirements and restrictions, all of which must be \nidentified and addressed.\nThe project made several findings and recommendations on dealing with digital \narchives, several of which are generic but some of which pertain particularly to \npersonal papers. For example, it found that digital preservation awareness \namongst creators is low, even relating to preservation for their own short to \nmedium term needs. Combined with the fact that many individuals do not even \nconsider their papers to be \u2018archives\u2019, many personal archives are at risk of loss \nfrom either deletion or obsolescence. The study therefore recommended that it \nis   important   to   increase   awareness   of   archival   and   digital   preservation \ngenerally, and specifically within domains and with individuals whose personal \narchives research libraries wish to collect. The project workbook therefore \nincludes guidance for creators of personal archives that includes information on \na number of relevant and basic issues like backup, automatically updating \nfields, and obsolescnce.\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Guidance  for creators of personal digital     \narchives\nInsofar as collection is concerned, project staff found that the storage of \npersonal digital archives is distributed across local devices, storage media, \nnetworked servers and web services. Some component parts may therefore be \noverlooked by a depositor or accessioning archivist, making it difficult to gather \nor be sure of a \u2018complete\u2019 collection. \nRegarding   obsolescence,   none   of   the   file   formats   accessioned   from \ncontemporary   politicians   (ranging   from   days   old   to   five   years   old)   were \ninaccessible   using   contemporary   computing   environments,   although   some \nrequired the use of proprietary software. However, deposits accepted from \nother, older sources proved more difficult, particularly data stored on Amstrad 3\u201d \ndisks \u2013 which required effort on a somewhat more heroic scale to recover. \nPARADIGM developed a records survey to characterise the contemporary \npersonal archives of politicians and assist archivists in identifying materials of \nhistorical value by assessing functions and roles, the nature of the records that \ndocument them, the vulnerability of records and their technical characteristics. \nStaff found that record surveying techniques are as useful for personal archives \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 44DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nas they are for organisational archives: they allow archivists to record valuable \ncontextual information about material that will be transferred in the immediate \nand distant future, and therefore to prepare for its arrival. This is especially true \nin a digital context where more information is needed for initial transfer and \nprocessing. A range of material from the survey was identified for collection, \nincluding office documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, emails, and \nemail attachments in various formats. \n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Records survey tool for digital private papers   \nThe project also developed  a deposit agreement to cover the placement of \nexemplar private paper materials for the duration of the pilot project, and a \nmodel agreement for the permanent placement of hybrid personal archives at a \nresearch library. These agreements help to establish the terms on which digital \narchives are placed with the research library, and ensure that both parties \nunderstand their obligations.\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Accessioning documentation for digital private     \npapers\nFinally, from a legislative perspective, the project recommended that changes to \nFreedom of Information legislation should be made to allow private archives \ndonated   to  public  institutions   to   be   excluded   from   the   provisions  of  the \nlegislation for a number of years. This will facilitate collection development, \nparticularly that which aims to acquire personal archival materials sooner after \ncreation.\n18\n5.1.2 Life-cycle investigations\nSeveral projects have taken a life cycle approach to preservation and digital \nasset management, notably PARADIGM, LIFE, Managing Risk and SHERPA \nDP.

The project final report notes that \npreservation awareness and activity should begin as early in the life cycle as \npossible. To persuade creators that some measure of curation is required of \nthem, an effort to engage with creators earlier in the life cycle of their archive is \nadvocated. \nThe case studies showed that it is easier to identify and obtain archival records \nwhen intervention takes place at an early stage in the life cycle; they particularly \nshowed that pro-active collection within  the  first  five years  required  less \nintervention and heroic effort than reactive receipt of deposits. However, \u2018pro-\nactive engagement with creators earlier in the life cycle places new demands on \nresearch libraries in terms of selecting and maintaining relationships with \nindividuals whose archives are now, or will be, historically valuable\u2019.\n\u2022 PARADIGM   final   report:   Case   study   on   collecting   archives   of \ncontemporary politicians ()\n\u2022 PARADIGM final report: Case study on digital archaeology ()\nThe model includes specific activities relevant for each stage in the life cycle \nand identifies the approximate location in which each of the stages should take \nplace (eg whilst with the creator, in transit, in a dark archive). The model is \navailable as part of the workbook:\n\u2022 PARADIGM project life cycle model\nLife cycles of digital library resources: The life cycle model used by LIFE is \nbased on work first undertaken by Andy Stephens in 1988, in which a formula \nfor calculating the total cost of keeping an item in a Library throughout its life \ncycle is introduced. This work was refined by Stephens over the next few years, \nintroducing costs to specific parts of the model, and was refined further by \nHelen Shenton in 2002\/03 when specific focus on the aspects of preservation \ncosts throughout the life cycle was included. This was a key extension and \nprovided the first example of a life cycle cost model with a consideration for \npreservation. This model was thus taken as the basis for the life cycle costing \nmodel adopted and developed by the LIFE project.\nThe life cycle model consists of the following stages:\n\u2022 Acquisition\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 46DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 Ingest\n\u2022 Metadata\n\u2022 Access\n\u2022 Storage\n\u2022 Preservation\nThese six main life cycle categories are broken down further into life cycle \nelements. The project used case study implementation of the model to attribute \ncosts to each stage. These should be taken as a guide, for the true costs may \nvary in different contexts. The persistent value of the model is in the provision of \na framework and identification of the main costing elements that impact on the \ntotal life cycle cost of managing and preserving digital library materials. \n\u2022 life cycle formula     (contained within summary report)\n\u2022 explanation of life cycle stages     (contained within final report, pp 10 - \n15)\n\u2022 research review on life cycles and life cycle costing   \nLife cycles of electronic corporate records: In recognition that planning for \npreservation of electronic records should begin as early in the life cycle as \npossible, the Managing Risk project took a life cycle perspective that informed \nthe survey of assets and subsequent recommendations. The project final report \nidentifies a generic high level set of life cycle stages and corresponding \nmanagement issues. The basic stages are:\n\u2022 Creation\n\u2022 Metadata\n\u2022 Review and Appraisal\n\u2022 Storage and Preservation\nThe survey furthermore suggested that a corporate classification scheme such \nas \u2018JISC\u2019s 2003 Study of the Records life cycle \u2013 Function Activity Model\u2019 would \nbe sufficient for classifying digital records throughout their life cycle.\n\u2022 Managing Risk project:  digital life cycle management: stages & \ncorresponding issues (pp 24 - 26)\nLife cycle of an e-print:  As part of its investigations into the preservation \nrequirements of e-prints, the SHERPA DP project outlined an e-prints life cycle \nmodel that not only identifies the main stages in the life cycle but also suggests \nhow responsibility may be allocated to different partners in the Sherpa DP \ndisaggregated model. This extended model is based on an original suggestion \nby James et al in 2004. The main stages are:\n\u2022 Creation \n\u2022 Submission\n\u2022 Revisions\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 47DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 Quality Assessment and Publication\n\u2022 End of frequent reading\n\u2022 Technical Obsolescence\n\u2022 Withdrawal\nThis life cycle model is unusual in that the cyclical nature of the model is unclear \nand the stages are not necessarily sequential. This is perhaps a particular \ncharacteristic of an e-print at its current stage of development, as opposed to an \narchival record or library resource. Archival records and library resources have \nbeen around for much longer and tend to follow clearer and better established \ncuratorial processes that are oriented towards a longer time frame. ePrints, in \ncomparison, are a relatively young and new type of digital asset for which the \ncommon ground in management processes have yet to be properly established \nand which are often perceived as having shorter retention requirements. \n\u2022 SHERPA DP project: life cycle model for an e-print in an institutional \nrepository ()\n5.1.3 Assessment & surveys\nSurveys and assessment formed a recurring theme in the programme. They \ncan be found in at least five projects and address a number of different topics. \nProgramme assessment and survey activities were of two main types, either \nexamining   existing   tools   or   approaches,   or   developing   tools  for   use   in \nassessment and surveys. \n\u2022 Assessment\/survey of existing tools or approaches\n\u2022 File format testing tools\n\u2022 Compliance with METS\n\u2022 Repository preservation policies and approaches\n\u2022 Institutional digital asset management practices\n\u2022 New assessment\/survey tools\n\u2022 Digital asset assessment methodology & tool\n\u2022 Records survey tool\n\u2022 Repository contents profiling service\n\u2022 OAIS\/METS Compliance assessment checklist\na) Assessments\/surveys of existing approaches\nFile format testing tools: The DAAT project undertook an exploration of \nexisting file format testing tools to explore whether or not they could be \nincorporated into the DAAT asset assessment tool. It focussed on three \ncurrently available tools: \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 48DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 DROID   (Digital   Record   Object   Identification),   a   software   tool \ndeveloped by The National Archives to perform automated batch \nidentification of file formats.\n\u2022 JHOVE - JSTOR\/Harvard Object Validation Environment, a tool that \nprovides   functions   to   perform   format-specific   identification, \nvalidation, and characterization of digital objects.\n\u2022 AIHT at Stanford University: Automated Preservation Assessment of \nHeterogeneous Digital Collections, and the Empirical Walker tool.\nThe aim was not to make a general report on whether the tools worked, but \nwhether they have useful qualities which will help identify the preservation \nneeds of digital assets. \nThe team found DROID to be useful: it contains information on a large range \nof file formats, based on regularly updated information from PRONOM. It can \nidentify the file format type and, for some types of files, also the version. \nHowever, the team found it did not provide any additional information that \ncouldn\u2019t be found by looking at the file extension or a directory listing. It does \nnot \u2013 and was not developed to \u2013 look at the entire information environment, \nwhich is something that the DAAT project D-PAS tool would need to do.\nJHOVE was found to provide more information, particularly in terms of object \nvalidation and metadata extraction\/reporting. The project test results indicated \nthat the tool had a high success rate, though it was significantly limited by its \nability to function on only a small range of file types. The team concluded that \nJHOVE is going to be essential in a digital preservation context (particularly \none which manages to implement the PREMIS model), as it can be used \ncontinually to check and recheck the validity and integrity of each digital object \nstored in the repository. \nThe DAAT team was unable to obtain a copy of the Empirical Walker tool, so \ntheir assessment was based purely on a description of the tool in a published \narticle. The article indicated that this was a significantly superior tool to either \nDROID or JHOVE, with significantly more functionality across both individual \nfiles and structured collections. The assessment is particularly useful for \ndemonstrating an increasing maturity in the tools developed to assess digital \nobjects. \n\u2022 DAAT file format tools report   \nCompliance with OAIS\/METS: The OAIS\/METS Assessment of Compliance \nproject assessed whether two existing systems \u2013 at the UK National Archives \nand the UK Data Acrhive \u2013 were compliant with the OAIS model and whether \nthe metadata stored by each system could be successfully and usefully mapped \nagainst the METS standard. \nThe project found that, based on its assessment, both organisations exceeded \nthe   requirements   of   the   OAIS   reference   model.   Assessment   of   practical \nimplementations of the model identified potential discrepancies inherent in the \ncurrent model, particularly an overstated strength in the relationship between \nthe OAIS concepts of producer and Designated Community, and the separation \nof the stored Archival Information Package from the stored Dissemination \nInformation Package. \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 49DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe project assessment of the use of METS within an OAIS environment \nconcluded that although there may be potential for its use in the future, there \nwas little advantage to be gained at this moment in time by using METS over \nother more formal metadata standards. The flexibility of the schema was on the \none hand deemed useful as it could be adapted for preservation purposes in \nenvironments with different object and preservation requirements. On the other \nhand, this very flexibility had potential to limit interoperability in a network of \nrepositories that do not use the same tools and metadata content. \n\u2022 Assessment of UKDA and TNA compliance with OAIS and METS     \nstandards: final report\nRepository preservation policies and approaches: PRESERV carried out a \nsample survey to determine exactly what repositories \u2013 particularly Institutional \nRepositories \u2013 were doing about digital preservation. The survey was carried \nout in June 2006 via email and was targeted at selected repository managers. \nRepositories were selected from the Registry of Open Access Repositories \n(ROAR). The availability of a PRESERV profile was a guiding factor in the \nselection process: since a knowledge of the file formats of objects in a \nrepository is a prerequisite for preservation planning, the availability of a \nPRESERV profile provided a reference point for repositories included in the \nsurvey.\nThe   survey   found   that   none   of   the   repositories   surveyed   had   a   formal \npreservation policy to guide decisions on the questions raised in the survey, yet \nde facto policies were being applied to specific areas such as file formats and \ntransformations,   for   example.   This   is   problematic,   for   the   absence   of \ncomprehensive and forward thinking policies meant that original source data \nwas frequently transformed without documentation, often prior to deposit in the \nrepository, and adversely impacted on an ability to validate authenticity and \nintegrity of files and their contents.\nThe survey questions and answers are detailed in the two documents below:\n\u2022 Survey of repository preservation policy and activity     (paper)\n\u2022 Repository models and policies for preservation     (presentation)\nDigital asset management practices: As part of its investigation into corporate \ndigital asset management at KCL and in recognition that preservation planning \nnecessarily begins at the start of the digital records life cycle, the Managing \nRisk project carried out a survey of digital assets and management practices in \na number of college units. \nThe survey covered both structured (databases) and unstructured (collections \nof individual files) digital assets. It revealed that practices were inconsistent \nacross different schools and departments, and that duplication \u2013 particularly \nbetween digital and paper versions of files \u2013 was commonplace. A number of \nrisks or inefficiencies were evident as a result of these practices. The inventory \nand   report   produced   by   this   exercise   enabled   the   project   to   make \nrecommendations  on   reducing   the   risks  associated   on   poor  digital   asset \nmanagement, and to work towards a viable, embedded, long-term College-wide \nstrategy for digital asset management.\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 50DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe survey was carried out by external consultants who retained IPR over their \nsurvey tool, so the tool itself is not available. An overview of the survey results, \nwhich are considered to be indicative of practices at many other similar \ninstitutions, is contained in the final report. \n\u2022 Managing Risk: final report   \nb) New survey & assessment tools\/services\nDigital asset assessment methodology & tool: Although the DAAT project \nwere unable to deliver a final functional tool for digital asset assessment, the \nproject did produce three deliverables that contribute to the development of \nsuch a tool.\nThe first of these is an assessment of functional attributes of a digital asset \nassessment tool, particularly the anticipated tool from the project, D-PAS. The \nreport states that the D-PAS tool requires sampling, assessment, and analysis \nattributes:\n\u2022 Sampling is necessary for the assessment to produce an accurate \nassessment of the overall collection without expending effort on \ninvestigating the entire collection, which in some contexts could \nconsist of entire libraries. \n\u2022 In order to make an accurate assessment of preservation priorities, \nthe   tool   will   need   to   assess   such   factors   as   use,   storage, \ncondition\/usability, value\/importance, item condition, file format, and \ndamage. \n\u2022 The  tool will  need  to  have  analytical  qualities so  that  factors \nassessed can have weighted scores returned which can then be \nused to generate reports on the preservation needs of a collection. \nThe project also identified a number of risk factors that may affect the survival \nof digital assets and thus should be measured by an automated assessment \ntool. These include physical risks for storage media and bit streams, format \nrisks, and organisational risks. \nFinally, the project released a preservation assessment method and prototype \ntool. The method comprises a manual survey, the results of which are entered \ninto a tool \u2013 currently an Access database \u2013 and automatically scored. \nGuidance on using the method and tool are available. The project final report \nrecognises that the survey tool requires significant additional work before it \nwas usable in a wide variety of settings, but the reports which the project has \nmade available are of use not only to those embarking on similar ventures, but \nalso to those looking at the wider issues of automation in digital curation. \n\u2022 Assessment of Risk Factors     \n\u2022 Assessment of Attributes   \n\u2022 Assessment of file format testing tools     \n\u2022 Database and data entry tool: D-PAS     \n\u2022 D-PAS Guidance Manual     \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 51DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nRecords Survey Tool: PARADIGM developed a records survey for use in the \noffices on politicians, but most of the questions may be applied to the private \npapers of other individuals. The survey is designed to elicit an overview of the \npaper and electronic records being created, with a view to their subsequent \nappraisal and preservation. \nThe   records   survey   tool   assisted   the   surveying   archivists   in   identifying \nmaterials of historical value by assessing functions and roles, the nature of the \nrecords that document them, the vulnerability of records and their technical \ncharacteristics. It also prompted creators to think about the historical value of \ntheir traditional and digital materials, as well as preservation-related issues. \nThe information that the records survey covers is described in the following \ntable:\nInformation Purpose\nSeries of historical interest Identify   location     of   material   for \naccession; descriptive overview assists \nin basic intellectual control of materials \nprior to cataloguing\nQuantity of material for accessioning Informs   archivist's   approach   to \naccession\nSpecification   of   hardware   and \nsoftware used to create records\nInforms   archivist's   approach   to \naccession;\nRecorded as preservation metadata\nFormats used Informs   archivist's   approach   to \naccession;\nRecorded as preservation metadata\nHow\/by whom records are created Recorded   as   useful   contextual \ninformation for descriptive purposes\nThird   party   rights   present   in   the \nmaterial\nInform   administration   of   material; \nrecorded as metadata\nAccess   restrictions   required   by \ncreator\nInforms administration of material\nHow records are managed by their \ncreator\nInforms timing of accessions\nParadigm supplemented the records survey tool with simple measures such \nas taking screenshots of file management tools and computer hardware \ndetails or generating textual files representing creators' arrangement of digital \nmaterials.

As a \nresult, file format profiles can be found for over 200 repositories listed in \nROAR. This assessment of file formats stored within a repository is the first \nstep in a more fully fledged technology watch service whereby \u2018at-risk\u2019 formats \nare subsequently flagged and acted upon.\nContinued provision and development of the web-based service is not a \ncertainty: the service is considered a demonstrator, it is not explicitly funded \nand will require some maintenance.

The UKDA and \nTNA developed a set of questions to help carry out their assessment of OAIS \ncompliance. This question set can be extended and tailored for use as a self-\nassessment tool for OAIS compliance testing by other institutions. Answers to \nthese questions can help when comparing the functions and workflows in an \narchive with those recommended by the OAIS standard.\nThe  question  set covers  the functions  of  the archive, OAIS  mandatory \nresponsibilities, functional entities, and the OAIS model.

The module is intended \nto provide trainees with an increased awareness of the factors affecting the \ncosts of digital preservation and an ability to set these costs within a wider life \ncycle and digital asset management strategic framework. \n\u2022 DPTP module on costs and risk management     (outline)\nDigital library cost model:  The LIFE project developed a life cycle based, \nscalable methodology to calculate the long term costs and future preservation \nrequirements of digital assets. Though the model has been developed in a \ndigital library setting, there is no reason to believe that elements of the model \nare not transferable to other contexts. The preservation aspect of the model is \nparticularly   valuable   as   most   other   work   on   preservation   costing   has \napproached the subject in isolation, rather than how it is integrated into overall \nlife cycle management. \n\u2022 LIFE project final report     (breakdown of cost model and approach, pp \n9 \u2013 16)\nPreservation service business model: SHERPA DP built on the outputs of \nboth the LIFE project to develop a cost and business model for the SHERPA \nDP preservation service. The model uses the life cycle cost model developed by \nthe LIFE Project as a basis, indicating how it may be applied to Service \nProviders offering a service to institutional repositories, or indeed anyone, who \nwish to assess the cost of preservation on a year-by-year basis. Costs are \ncalculated on a three-tier basis \u2013 set-up costs; service costs; and exit costs that \noccur at different time period during the Service contract. Service costs serve as \nthe focus of investigation, with the cost of storage, preservation and limited \ntechnical support being provided as examples of the method in which different \nlevels of service will incur varying costs. The business model may prove useful \nfor any institution that is seeking to establish a Preservation Service.\nFurther information on the business model is contained within the project final \nreport:\n\u2022 SHERPA DP final report ()\nIntangible assets business case model:  The business case model that \nESPIDA developed can help make business cases for proposals that bring \nbenefit in more intangible spheres than immediate financial benefits. While it \nwas   designed   initially   to   be   used   within   the   area   of   digital   resource \nmanagement, it has potential for far wider application, including decision \nmaking, performance measurement, and change management. \n\u2022 ESPIDA handbook & model   \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 54DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n5.1.5 Training\nThe importance of training for preservation and digital asset management \ncannot be underestimated. Many of the practices in digital asset management \nand preservation are fundamentally different to those for digital materials. Staff \nworking towards implementing solutions therefore often require training in new \ntechnologies, approaches, and even ways of thinking. Training possibilities \nwithin DPAM were diverse, in keeping with the broad and diverse nature of the \nprogramme.\n\u2022 Comprehensive preservation training\n\u2022 METS training\n\u2022 Business case training\n\u2022 Digital Asset Management System training\nComprehensive preservation training:  The DPTP developed a modular \ntraining programme with content targeted at all levels of staff from service or \nproject managers to technical and operational staff. DPTP's broader aim was \nto equip staff with the skills, tools and confidence to be able to embark on a \npragmatic and cost-effective digital preservation programme appropriate to \ntheir own institutional needs, taking into account the practical reality that any \napproach to digital preservation is iterative and that no organisation is able to \nleap instantly into a fully formed digital preservation programme. \nAimed at multiple levels of attendee, the course brought together technical \nand archival professions to learn the same standards and methods for digital \npreservation, examining the need for policies, planning, strategies, standards \nand procedures in digital preservation. DPTP training materials are provided in \nhard copy to course delegates. The website provides an overview of the \ncontents of the course and each module. More precise information about \ncourse and learning materials is available on request from the DPTP project \nadministrator.\n\u2022 DTPT training modules: introduction   \n\u2022 Access: overview   \n\u2022 Costs and Risks Management: overview   \n\u2022 Digital Records Management: overview   \n\u2022 File Formats: overview   \n\u2022 Institutional Repositories: overview   \n\u2022 Legal Issues: overview   \n\u2022 Living with Obsolescence: overview   \n\u2022 Metadata: overview   \n\u2022 OAIS: overview   \n\u2022 Outsourcing: overview   \n\u2022 Preservation Approaches: overview   \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 55DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nMETS: The METS Awareness Training project aimed to raise awareness in the \nUK   higher   education   community   of   the   METS   (\u201cMetadata   Encoding   and \nTransmission\u201d) standard, which had been devised to act as a generic container \nfor all metadata associated with objects in a digital library environment. MAT \nTraining materials are a mixture of graphic presentations and documentary case \nstudies. All are available from the project website.\n\u2022 MAT training materials   \nBusiness cases: The ESPIDA project developed a training exercise to facilitate \nunderstanding and implementation of the model. The exercise accompanies the \nESPIDA Handbook and offers training in how to use the Handbook. It is \nenvisaged   that   the   training   exercise   could   be   used   as   a   first   step   in \nunderstanding the approach before full implementation within organisations or \ngroups wishing to use it.\n\u2022 ESPIDA training exercise   \nDigital Asset Management Systems:    The MANDATE toolkit contains a \nsection   on   training,   highlighting   the   importance   of   training   for   managers \napproaching digital asset management, including those with responsibility for \nflexible learning, library services, and quality, and technical managers. In \ndevelopment of the toolkit and in preparation for the development of a digital \nasset management system at the College, training at conceptual level was \nprovided for both administrative staff and representatives of teaching staff (ILT \nChampions), based on an early prototype intended to support this purpose and \nact as a consultation tool. The prototype allowed consultation about interface \ndesign and the fit of the system with users' understandings of their role in the \ndigital asset management workflow. The 'Guidance notes for using the asset \nmanagement prototype' were used to support this training.\n\u2022 Guidance notes for using the asset management prototype        \n5.1.6 Repositories\nRepositories were a significant element of the programme, particularly in terms \nof   preservation   infrastructures   and   institutional   repository   infrastructure \ndevelopment.

Software\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 56DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nSelection   of   software:  There   are   many   repository   software   options   or \npackages to choose from. The big three \u2013 Eprints, Fedora and DSpace \u2013 are \nthe most widely known open source solutions, particularly in the Institutional \nRepository sector, but there are several alternatives. The MANDATE toolkit \ncontains information on the issues surrounding selection of a 'digital asset \nmanagement' system. Its inclusion (albeit somewhat limited) of proprietary \nsolutions and supporting tools is particularly valuable.\nThe College ultimately chose to  develop a  system  based  on  proprietary \ndatabase management and web server software for the implementation of the \nmandate toolkit, reflecting concerns about the total cost of open source software \nand the skill set of its technical support teams (which are based on Microsoft \nplatforms.) \n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Section on Software   \nPARADIGM compared FEDORA with DSpace and ultimately selected FEDORA \nfor implementation within the project as a working preservation repository \nsystem. This was for several reasons, including its extensibility and  its ability to \nsupport complex objects and their hierarchical relationships. A comparison of the two \nwill be published as part of the PARADIGM workbook. \n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook   \nThe DPTP course included a section on institutional repositories that introduced \na number of systems and described some of their characteristics.

It was not designed with long term preservation in mind; the \nemphasis is on Open Access. The PRESERV project was focused particularly \non preservation services using Eprints software. It did not aim to make Eprints \ninto a long term preservation infrastructure, but to enable Eprints IRs to deliver \nmaterials with the necessary information for preservation specialists to provide \nthose   services.   The   PRESERV   project   investigated   means   for   improving \nsupport for the OAIS Ingest and the Archival Store functions in Eprints-based \nIRs and developed a small number of plug-ins so that support for these services \ncan be provided in real IRs.

Services\nFormat profiling: The PRESERV project investigated long-term preservation \nfor institutional repositories (IRs), by exploring the capacity for preservation \nservices in conjunction with specialists, such as national libraries and archives \nand developing a web-based service for identifying the format of repository \ncontents. One of the most widely recognised problems in preserving digital \ninformation is format obsolescence: as applications change over time to exploit \nthe capabilities of new technology, digital objects created using old formats, or \neven old versions of formats, can become unreadable and the content and \nauthenticity of a digital object is therefore at risk. One approach to this problem \nis to migrate the original format to a current, readable version. By knowing the \nformats of all objects in a repository, preservation strategies can be planned \nand action taken at the appropriate time on those objects that may otherwise be \nat risk of becoming obsolete. The need for accurate identification of the format \nof original source objects if often therefore at the centre of much digital \npreservation activity.\nPRESERV worked with The National Archives to link the widely renowned \nPRONOM-DROID tool for file format identification to the widely used Registry of \nOpen Access Repositories (ROAR) through an OAI harvesting service. As a \nresult, file format profiles can be found for over 200 repositories listed in ROAR. \nThis service \u2013 that identifies the file formats stored within a repository \u2013 is the \nfirst step in a more fully fledged technology watch service whereby \u2018at-risk\u2019 \nformats are subsequently flagged and acted upon and has been termed the \nPRONOM-ROAR format profiling service.\nContinued provision and development of the web-based service is not a \ncertainty: the service is considered a demonstrator, it is not explicitly funded and \nwill require some maintenance. The code for the demonstrator has however \nbeen deposited in the local eprints repository.\n\u2022 Digital   Preservation   Service   Provider   Models   for   Institutional     \nRepositories: towards distributed services\n\u2022 PRESERV Format Profiling: PRONOM-ROAR: An illustrated guide   \n\u2022 Public PRESERV profiles available via the ROAR website   \n\u2022 Institutional repository preservation contexts   \nPreservation   Service   Provider:  The   SHERPA   DP   project   developed   a \npractical and cost effective shared service system for performing preservation \nactivities for a distributed network of institutional repositories. It created a \ndemonstrator   for   a   Preservation   Service   Provider   and   established   the \nassociated technical infrastructure and business model to support the project. \nThe model developed by the project identified two types of institution \u2013 Content \nProviders and Service Providers - that perform different tasks in the workflow. \nThe institutional repositories participating in the project served as Content \nProviders, taking responsibility for accepting data and making it available to \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 59DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\ntheir user community. The Service Provider, in turn, takes responsibility for the \nlong-term   management   of   the   digital   objects,   essentially   serving   as   a \ncentralised \u201cdark archive\u201d. \nThe most notable development of the Preservation Service demonstrator was \nthe creation of a reusable service framework that allows the integration of a \ndisparate collection of software tools and standards. The project adopted \nFedora as the basis for the preservation repository and built a technical \ninfrastructure   necessary   to   harvest   metadata,   transfer   data,   and   perform \nrelevant preservation activities. Appropriate software tools and standards were \nselected, including JHOVE and DROID as software tools to validate data \nobjects; METS as a packaging standard; and PREMIS as a basis on which to \ncreate preservation metadata.\nThe demonstrator established during the project will continue to archive data \nmade available by SHERPA DP partner institutions for a minimum of one year. \nFurther investigation is necessary to establish a broader and more sustainable \nframework of repository services. The Preservation Service, as defined by the \nproject proposal, performed  preservation  activities for   a  small  number  of \ninstitutional repositories operating the EPrints and DSpace repository software. \nHowever it found it unlikely that the revenue generated by e-print archives will \nbe sufficient to support a full preservation service. A new need may be identified \nfor the provision of preservation services to repositories that are responsible for \na wider range of content types.\n\u2022 SHERPA DP Preservation Handbook Part II: A disaggregated model \nfor preservation service: the SHERPA DP approach ()\n3. Standards\nOpen Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model: The OAIS \nmodel establishes a common framework of terms and concepts that describe \nthe necessary functions and elements of an archive intended to provide \npermanent or indefinite long term preservation of digital information. Standard \nterminology   allows   existing   and   future   archives   to   be   more   meaningfully \ncompared and contrasted. It also provides a basis for further standardisation \nwithin an archival context and it should promote greater vendor awareness of, \nand support of, archival requirements. The OAIS reference model became an \nISO standard in 2003.\nThe model has been widely seized upon by the archival and preservation \ncommunities and several institutions now claim compliance with the model. Yet \nthe reference is model is not a precise specification and functionality of existing \nsystems can be mapped against the OAIS model to varying levels. 'Compliance' \ncan therefore mean different things to different organisations. \nThe OAIS\/METS Assessment project sought to explore in detail what is meant \nby compliance and to assess whether two existing systems \u2013 the UKDA and the \nsystem in place at TNA \u2013 can be meaningfully deemed 'compliant'. In addition to \na comprehensive assessment of compliance, the project delivered a useful \nchecklist   for   other   institutions   to   use   in   assessing   their   own   levels   of \ncompliance:\n\u2022 A set of questions for OAIS compliance self-testing     (pp 105 \u2013 107)\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 60DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nSHERPA   DP   used   the   OAIS   reference   model   to   develop   a   persistent \npreservation environment for the SHERPA consortium, assigning rights and \nresponsibilities and establishing protocols and work flow processes that will \nensure the long-term preservation of the repository content. An objective of the \nSHERPA DP project was to ensure that institutional repositories could be \nconsidered OAIS compliant. The final SHERPA DP model is essentially a \nmodified version of an OAIS. The services provided by institutional repositories \nare mapped to the OAIS reference model and notable omissions identified and \nallocated to the preservation service. \nThe project delivered a report on an OAIS compliant model for disaggregated \nservices to be delivered as part of the SHERPA DP project, including an \nassessment of the suitability of the reference model as a practical model. The \nhandbook contains a useful overview of the OAIS framework and discussion of \nOAIS compliance, based in part on the investigations carried out as part of the \nOAIS\/METS project. \n\u2022 SHERPA DP Handbook: an OAIS compliant model for disaggregated \nservices ()\nThe PARADIGM workbook has extensive information on the OAIS model, \nincluding some examples of how the model can work in practice. The section \ndoes not relate extensively to long term preservation, though it is a useful \noverview with links to related initiatives including compliance and certification.\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: section on the OAIS model   \nThe DPTP included a module on OAIS. This was intended to provide trainees \nwith a better understanding of the OAIS model and its applicability. The website \nprovides an overview of the contents of the module. More precise information \nabout course and learning materials is available on request from the  DPTP \nproject administrator.\n\u2022 DPTP module: OAIS   \nPREMIS: PREMIS is a de facto metadata schema standard for preservation \nmetadata. The PREMIS data dictionary specifies core metadata for verifying \nand tracking the provenance, authenticity and integrity of preserved digital \nassets.\nPARADIGM explored the use of PREMIS metadata within METS files and the \nworkbook contains a section on using PREMIS\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: section on PREMIS   \nSHERPA   DP   adopted   the   PREMIS   data   dictionary   as   the   basis   for   its \npreservation metadata schema. The project identified refinements necessary to \nsupport the operation of the preservation service. The broad requirements of \nPREMIS were further supplement by format-specific metadata (e.g. MIX for \nimage metadata), as appropriate. \nPRESERV explored the use of PREMIS within an IR context. It found that \nPREMIS appeared to provide an excellent basis on which assess the needs of \nIRs with respect to preservation metadata, and it was possible to map the \nPREMIS elements to an extended model incorporating preservation services \nand   registries.   However,   more   implementation   and   testing   are   required, \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 61DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nespecially   to   validate   the   allocation   of   elements   to   preservation   service \nproviders and environment registries.\n\u2022 Preservation   Metadata   for   Institutional   Repositories:   applying     \nPREMIS\nMetadata   Encoding   and   Transmission   Standard   (METS):  The   METS \nschema is a de facto standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and \nstructural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using an \nXML Schema. The METS standard has been proposed as a suitable vehicle to \nsupport transfer and dissemination of objects for preservation by an external \nservice   provider,   particularly   in   the   case   of   complex   objects   (i.e.   those \ncomprising more than one file). \nThe OAIS\/METS Awareness project considered the METS metadata standard, \nhow it could be used further in a digital archive and its potential role at the \nNational Archives and in the UKDA. The project found that METS documents \n(i.e. instances of METS in practice) are compatible with the OAIS model but \nthat,   particularly   for   born   digital   material,   there   was   no   clear   benefit   in \nimplementing METS in the test repositories at this moment in time. The \nstrengths and weaknesses of METS and its applicability within an archival \nenvironment are discussed in more detail in the project final report:\n\u2022 OAIS\/METS Awareness final report: C7 Using the METS metadata     \nstandard in a digital archive (pp 71 \u2013 80)\nThe PARADIGM workbook section on administrative and preservation metadata \ncontains a detailed introduction to METS and its use within a digital archive \nsetting. The project developed specific guidance for users implementing METS \nin a digital archive setting, including advice on dealing with problems ingesting \nMETS files into Fedora:\n\u2022 Designing a METS Schema ()\n\u2022 Sample METS Schema(s) for Personal Papers ()\n\u2022 Troubleshooting METS files and Fedora's Directory Ingest Service   \nPRESERV released a METS export plug-in derived from work done by the \nRepository Bridge project, who implemented a METS export for EPrints 2. This \nwas updated for the new plug-in architecture and data model in EPrints 3. \n\u2022 Complex-Object Export: METS plug-in        \nMPEG-DIDL:  Similarly to METS, the de facto standard MPEG-DIDL (Digital \nItem Declaration Language) has also been proposed as a suitable vehicle to \nsupport transfer and dissemination of complex objects for preservation by an \nexternal service provider. PRESERV developed an MPEG DIDL plug-in to \npackage data for delivery to an external service that has since been integrated \ninto Eprints v3.\n\u2022 Complex-Object Export: DIDL plug-in        \n4. Training\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 62DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nPreservation:  The DPTP  course included numerous sections relevant  to \nestablishing and managing a repository, such as institutional repositories, file \nformats,   OAIS,     legal   issues,   metadata,   outsourcing,   and   preservation \napproaches.  The website only provides an overview of the contents of module. \nMore precise information about course and its learning materials is available on \nrequest from the DPTP project administrator. \n\u2022 DPTP IR module overview   \nMETS:  The METS Awareness Training project delivered a series of training \nevents around the country that  aimed to raise awareness in the UK higher \neducation community of the METS standard. METS was devised to act as a \ngeneric container for all metadata associated with objects in a digital library \nenvironment. MAT training materials are a mixture of graphic presentations and \ndocumentary case studies. All are available from the project website.\n\u2022 MAT training materials   \n5.1.7 Legal issues\nLegal challenges are present across the life cycle, from active use to archiving, \npreservation, destruction and future access. The legal challenge of managing \nand preserving digital information was addressed in a number of projects. The \nmost comprehensive of these was undoubtedly PARADIGM, which examined \nlegal issues across the entire life cycle of digital private papers and records. \nOther projects were more focussed in their explorations: MANDATE explored \nlegislation   relevant   to   digital   asset   management   systems   and   strategies; \nManaging Risk looked at the legal risks of failure to manage assets in line with \nlegislation, and; the DPTP covered a number of fundamental legal issues as \nthey relate to preservation. In all cases, UK legislation was taken as the basis \nfor legal discussions.\n\u2022 Public Records Acts\n\u2022 Human rights\n\u2022 IPR\n\u2022 Access\n\u2022 Defamation\n\u2022 Environmental regulations\nPublic Records Acts. The PARADIGM project notes that Public Record Acts \nare important to repositories collecting private papers because the boundaries \nbetween public and private records are often blurred, and it briefly explores \nwhat this means in practical terms of accessioning and providing access:\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Public Records Acts   \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 63DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nHuman Rights:  Data Protection; Human Rights, Privacy & Electronic \nCommunications. \nThe PARADIGM workbook explores the impact of several pieces of legislation \nrelating to human rights, including the 1998 Human Rights Act, the 1998 Data \nProtection   Act,   and   the   2003   Privacy   and   Electronic   Communications \nRegulations. Archives relate to Human Rights in two ways:\n\u2022 As primary sources documenting the evolution of Human Rights and \nthe memory of their abuse.\n\u2022 The   misuse   of   archives   could   potentially   violate   Human   Rights, \nincluding Article 8 - Right to Respect for Private and Family Life.  \nMost personal archives, digital or otherwise, will contain personal data that is \nsubject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Finally, privacy and \nconfidentiality concerns can affect how digital materials can be managed within \nthe repository and how and when they can be made accessible to researchers. \n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Legal issues - Human rights   \nThe MANDATE toolkit explores the impact of the Data Protection Act on the \ndesign and operation of a digital asset management strategy and system. The \nAct can have a direct impact on the storage and management of information \nabout assets when details about individuals involved in the production of an \nasset are stored.  At John Wheatley College, personal data are not held in the \nsystem   and   the   only   area   of   potential   concern   relates   to   references   to \nindividuals in personnel and staffing committee meeting minutes: This is dealt \nwith by existing practice which publishes selectively as appropriate. Issues of \nconfidentiality arising in other minutes are monitored through general staff \nawareness   of   data   protection   issues,   and   specifically   through   training   of \nadministrative staff responsible for minutes.\n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Legislation for Data Protection   \nThe   DPTP   training   module   on   legal   issues   includes   information   on   the \nrequirements of the Data Protection Act. \nIntellectual   Property   Rights:   Copyright,   Patents,   Trademarks,   Design, \nConfidence & Trade Secrets\nThe PARADIGM workbook contains detailed explorations of how a number of \nIntellectual Property Rights can impact on the management and preservation of \ndigital materials. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) are composed of a group of \nrights all relating to the protection of intellectual property. The main types of IPR \nare  considered to be Copyright, Patent, Trademark, Design, Confidence & \nTrade Secrets. and Database Right.  Copyright is a concern for all types of \narchives, whereas Patent, Trademark, Design and Confidence issues are most \nlikely to be encountered when dealing with the archives of business and \nscience. \nThe workbook asserts IPR as one of the main 'stumbling blocks' in the \ncollection, curation, and provision of access to digital records and advocates an \neffective rights management policy and published 'take down' policy as the best \nway to address IPR challenges. \n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Legal issues - IPR   \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 64DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThe MANDATE toolkit explores the impact of Copyright legislation on the design \nand operation of an institutional digital asset management strategy and system. \nFor most colleges the major issue in the application of this act to the digital \nasset management system will be in managing access to their assets and \nensuring that they respect the rights of other asset producers. \nThe toolkit asserts that copyright for many college-produced assets (such as \nminutes) clearly lies with the college. However, the situation is not so clear cut \nfor other assets, such as learning materials. The understanding of who owns \nlearning materials and similar assets that are produced in connection with \nemployment may be unclear and have to be explicitly addressed. Furthermore, \nwhen the system contains learning materials, there is the possibility that \nmaterial belonging to an external party may have been included. Permission \nmay be required for subsequent storage and\/or re-use of such material.\n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Legislation for Copyright   \nThe   DPTP   training   module   on   legal   issues   includes   information   on   the \nrequirements of the Data Protection Act. \nAccess: Freedom of Information Act (2000), Special Educational Needs & \nDisability Act (2001),  Disability  Discrimination Act  (1995), Council  of \nEurope Policy on Access to Archives\nAccess is a major driver in the preservation of digital materials and certain \npieces   of   legislation   must   be   addressed   before   access   is   granted.   The \nPARADIGM workbook notes that recent policy and legislation marks a trend \ntowards increasing access. Archivists must therefore strike a balance between \nsuch pieces of access legislation as the Freedom of Information Act, the Special \nEducational Needs Act, and Disability Discrimination Act, whilst simultaneously \ncatering to privacy regulations.\n\u2022 PARADIGM workbook: Legal issues - Access   \nThe MANDATE toolkit contains information on FoI legislation, the  Disability \nDiscrimination Act, and the Special Needs and Disability Act. An overview of all \nthree is provided, plus information on how the legislation impacts on the design \nor operation of an institutional digital asset management strategy and system. \nThe toolkit contains a series of questions that institutions should consider in \norder to effectively and efficiently comply with all three pieces of legislation. It \nalso lists a number of tools that may be suitable for checking compliance of the \nsystems interface with the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.\n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Legislation for Special Needs   \n\u2022 MANDATE toolkit: Legislation for Freedom of Information   \nThe   DPTP   training   module   on   legal   issues   includes   information   on   the \nrequirements of the Freedom of Information Act. \nDefamation: The UK Defamation Act 1996\nThe PARADIGM workbook explores how defamation legislation may impact on \ndigital archives, particularly when access to such materials is granted. It \nrecommends that institutions have a 'notice and take down policy' whereby \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 65DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\noffending material can be immediately withdrawn from public access upon \nnotice of a potentially libellous statement. \nEnvironmental regulations: Environmental Information Regulations (2004)\nThe DPTP training module on legal issues covers the UK's Environmental \nInformation Regulations and the impact they have on access and dissemination \nof environmental information. \nLegal deposit\nThe DPTP training module on legal issues covers the UK's Legal Deposit Act \nand the impact this has for deposit of digital materials.. \n5.1.8 Case studies\nCase studies are incredibly valuable. In some circumstances, they provide a \nbasis on which to test and refine a given theory or approach. In others, they can \nbe used to demonstrate to  the wider community how an approach was \nimplemented in a given context. This can give rise to several practical issues \nthat may otherwise not be obvious to new implementers. In many cases, case \nstudies can accomplish both of these outcomes, acting both as test cases AND \nas learning tools for others. Almost every project in this funding strand drew \nupon case studies during the course of the project. The prevalence of case \nstudies within this strand illustrates a keen desire on the behalf of participants to \nencourage and assist in broader implementation of project outputs. Case \nstudies covered:\n\u2022 Digital asset management in an FE setting\n\u2022 Digital asset management in an HE setting\n\u2022 Costing of digital library collections\n\u2022 Metadata implementation in digital libraries\n\u2022 Archival collection development\n\u2022 Developing a business case to support intangible assets\nDigital asset management in an FE setting:  MANDATE is an outstanding \nexample of how case studies can function both as test scenarios against which \nto   develop   and   refine   an   approach   and   also   as   practical   examples   of \nimplementation from which others can glean valuable learning experiences. \nEach chapter of the MANDATE toolkit is supplemented by a case study \ndescription   of   implementation   experiences   at   John   Wheatley   college   that \ndemonstrates how the toolkit was applied and shows how and why decisions \nwere made to support any given activity. Textual descriptions are supported by \ngraphics and tables, including screen shots of the prototype system and \nworkflow models, and several links to supporting or college documentation are \nintegrated into the study. MANDATE staff at John Wheatley intend to update the \nsystem once the system is actually up and running. The study is especially \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 66DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nvaluable as it is the only instance where research is oriented particularly on an \nFE environment.   \n\u2022 MANDATE Case Study   \n\u2022 Purpose of digital asset management   \n\u2022 Development of digital asset management        \n\u2022 Asset types        \n\u2022 Metadata requirements        \n\u2022 Metadata standards issues        \n\u2022 Metadata quality issues        \n\u2022 Workflow modelling and development        \n\u2022 Interoperability issues        \n\u2022 Metadata mappings        \n\u2022 OAIS model        \n\u2022 Preservation issues        \n\u2022 Compliance with Freedom of Information legislation        \n\u2022 Compliance with Data Protection legislation        \n\u2022 Compliance with Copyright legislation        \n\u2022 Compliance with Special needs legislation        \n\u2022 Software issues        \n\u2022 Training issues        \nDigital asset management in an HE setting:  Similarly, the Managing Risk \nproject provided a local case study that addressed a common and shared \ninstitutional   need   for   a   digital   asset   management   strategy.   The   project's \nfindings, although directed very much at an internal audience, are therefore \nhighly relevant to the wider community and institutions facing similar challenges. \n\u2022 Managing Risk project: final report   \nCosting of digital library collections: The LIFE project also drew upon case \nstudies   as   a   mechanism   for   implementing   and   testing   their   model   and \nidentifying actual costs for different types of digital objects in different scenarios. \nThe case studies were chosen with the precise aim of challenging the LIFE \nmethodology as robustly as possible. Although preservation activities were not \nundertaken in any of the case studies, the studies were fundamental in shaping \nthe specific and required elements of the preservation aspect of the model.\n\u2022 LIFE project\n\u2022 VDEP Case study     (final report, pp 17 \u2013 51)\n\u2022 Web archiving case study     (final report, pp 52 \u2013 63)\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 67DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n\u2022 UCL e-journals case study     (final report, pp 64 \u2013 87)\n\u2022 VDEP Preservation model   \n\u2022 Web Arc preservation model   \nMetadata implementation in digital libraries: case studies were used as a \nvaluable learning tool in the METS Awareness training project. The course \nincluded two types of case studies: the first comprising a presentation on METS \nimplementation in a practical setting, such as at the National Library of Wales or \nOxford Digital Library, and the second a fictional case study for participants to \nuse in a practical exercise on implementing METS.\n\u2022 METS in the Oxford Digital Library: A Case Study     (ppt)\n\u2022 Case study 1: A slide collection     (doc)\n\u2022 Case study 2: A collection of online books     (doc)\n\u2022 Case study 3: A collection of online texts     (doc)\n\u2022 Case study 4: A collection of videos     (doc)\nArchival Collection Development: The PARADIGM project carried out three \ncase   study\/pilot   projects   to   test   and   refine   their   knowledge   of   collection \ndevelopment   for   digital   materials.   This   enabled   them   to   make   important \nrecommendations   on   approaching   and   developing   collection   development \npolicies and strategies, though the project ultimately recommended that more \ncase studies are needed, particularly those that test different approaches or \nwhich address different domains. One primary case study was carried out, \nsupplemented by two pilots. The primary case study involved identifying, \ncapturing, and transferring records from contemporary politicians. This was \nsupported by two pilot investigations. It led to a series of recommendations on \nhow this valuable historical resource could be targeted for preservation. The \nstudy was supported by two complimentary pilot projects, one examining how \npolitical web resources could be targeted, the other exploring the issues in \naccessioning digital deposits from physical storage media. Project staff worked \nwith the archive of Barbara Castle, which included two old PCs and a range of \nAmstrad disks \u2013 this was an archive deposited in the old-fashioned way (most \nof it is paper \u2013 some 500 boxes) and we worked with the BL on using forensic \ncomputing techniques to extract faithful images of the hard disks. \n\u2022 Case study 1 - Hybrid personal archives of working politicians     (final \nreport, pp16 - 20)\n\u2022 Case study 2 - Web archiving pilot     (final report, p23)\n\u2022 Case study 3 - Digital archaeology pilot     (final report, p24)\nDeveloping a business case to support intangible assets: A number of case \nstudies were undertaken as part of the development of the ESPIDA approach, \nand as an aid to deeper understanding of the work and its applicability.  The \ncase studies demonstrate how the ESPIDA approach can be used in different \nscenarios and explore some examples that may hold some resonance for areas \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 68DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nwithin HE\/FE. Three case studies were undertaken, testing the model on an e-\ntheses collection, an IR, and a museums collection. The studies were created \nwith the help of stakeholders within and external to the University of Glasgow. \nWhilst based on real life scenarios, the studies are for explanatory purposes \nonly and are not actual business cases.\nFor the Institutional Repository study, the project team that had developed the \nUniversity\u2019s own repository helped explore the benefits and so-called 'dis-\nbenefits' that can arise from setting up a repository to manage and disseminate \nacademic outputs. The cost elements of this study are based on an example \nfrom Edinburgh University Library.\nThe eTheses study examines how three different options can be appraised \nusing the ESPIDA Scorecards. By presenting the options together, decision-\nmakers can quickly compare the three options and understand the risks and \nbenefits of each.\nThe final study looks at the cataloguing of archival holdings of a museum. This \nwas developed with the help of external experts and offers a rich example, \nwhere benefits are quite slow to be realised.\n\u2022 ESPIDA Institutional Repository case study     (handbook, pp 36 \u2013 42)\n\u2022 ESPIDA eTheses case study     (handbook, pp 43 \u2013 48)\n\u2022 ESPIDA museum archival collection case study     (handbook, pp 49 - \n54) \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 69DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n6 Appendices: Related initiatives\n6.1 Digital Repositories programme (2005 \u2013 2007)\nDPAM is not the only programme to address preservation. The JISC Digital \nRepositories programme (also known as the 3-05 programme) included a \nnumber of projects that addressed preservation as part of a wider investigation \ninto repository establishment and management. Furthermore, a number of \ninternational initiatives complement the work undertaken as part of the DPAM \nprogramme. These have not been included in the thematic overview as the \nDPAM programme is already incredibly diverse. Introduction of a second series \nof projects with a far less immediate application to preservation and asset \nmanagement   runs   the   risk   of   significantly   diluting   the   coherence   of   the \nsynthesis. These projects and initiatives are instead listed below.\nThe 2005 \u2013 2007 Digital Repositories programme funded a number of clustered \nprojects. Projects in the Repositories and Preservation cluster are as follows:\n\u2022 SherpaPlus\n\u2022 MIDESS\n\u2022 EThOS\n\u2022 Repository Bridge\n\u2022 Spectra\nSherpaPlus\nSherpaPlus is an extension of the SHERPA (Securing a Hybrid Environment for \nResearch, Preservation and Access) project funded under the FAIR (Focus on \nAccess to Institutional Repositories) programme (2002 \u2013 2005). The SHERPA \nproject worked with twenty partner institutions to set up institutional open \naccess e-print repositories that complied with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) \nProtocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI PMH). SherpaPlus is an extension of the \nSHERPA   network   to   benefit   the   wider   HE   community   and   support \nimplementation of institutional repositories outside of the original Sherpa partner \ninstitutions. It also explores issues arising as more experience is gained with \ninstitutional repositories and they become more mature. \nSherpaPlus has a strong emphasis on advocacy and training, particularly in \nterms of events. A number of SherpaPlus road shows are planned for early \n2007 in which speakers from SHERPA explore various key issues surrounding \nOpen  Access,  institutional  repositories,  scholarly publications  and  authors \nrights.     Through   providing   a   centralised   information   point   for   advocacy, \nSHERPA Plus can facilitate development of advocacy work in the large number \nof institutions without repositories.\nFor the most part, preservation is the domain of another member of the \nSHERPA suite; Sherpa DP (see main report). However, Sherpa, and by \nextension SherpaPlus, have helped raise awareness within the repository \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 70DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\ncommunity of preservation issues, particularly the work undertaken by Sherpa \nDP, and promoted SHERPA advice and research into preservation prior to the \nformation of Sherpa DP. This includes:\n\u2022 Requirements   and   Feasibility   Study   on   Preservation   of   ePrints     \n(Report commissioned by JISC, October 2003)\n\u2022 The Digital Preservation of ePrints     (D-Lib magazine, Sept 2003)\n\u2022 Selection Criteria for the Preservation of ePrints     (Project report, Feb \n2004) \n\u2022 Report on Preservation Standards     (Project report, March 2004)\nThe team has also developed deposit licenses that give repositories the right to \ncopy works for preservation purposes:\n\u2022 Report on a deposit license for ePrints     (Project report, June 2004)\nMIDESS - Management of Images in a Distributed Environment with Shared Services\nMIDESS explores the management of digitised content, particularly image and \nmultimedia material, in institutional and cross institutional contexts. A pilot \ninfrastructure has been established that can serve as a model for future national \ndistributed repository activities, distributed across three locations (University of \nLeeds, University of Birmingham and London School of Economics). This \nenables partners to investigate opportunities for sharing and re-using data \nacross institutions, interoperability issues within a network of different repository \nsoftware   implementations,   and   requirements   for   centralised   metadata \nharvesting services.\nWork package 5 explores the key issues in digital preservation and investigates \nhow these can be practically addressed by digital repositories specialising in the \nstorage of media such as sounds, images, and moving images. Specific \nmetadata elements for the practical preservation of digitised multimedia material \nare  developed   or  identified.  Preservation   features  and  functionality  within \ndifferent repository software are evaluated. The work package 5 report contains \ninformation on preservation strategies, formats, automatic metadata extraction, \npreservation   functionality   within   the   three   selected   implementations,   and \nminimum preservation metadata.\n\u2022 WP5: Digital Preservation Requirements Specification   \nWork package 2 comprised an evaluation of a broader range of repository \nsoftware in order to investigate potential solutions to requirements identified as \npart of the WP3 User Needs Analysis. These documents also provide insight \ninto preservation and asset management issues:\n\u2022 WP2: Functional and Technical Requirements Specification   \n\u2022 WP3: User Needs Analysis     \nA broad overview of the project is available in a presentation given to ARLIS \n(Arts and Libraries Society) by Stephen Charles in July 2006\n\u2022 MIDESS Presentation   \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 71DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nEThOS \u2013 Electronic Theses Online Service\nEThOS developed a prototype system to allow individuals to find, access, and \narchive electronic theses produced in UK HE institutions, using a UK database \nof theses with a central hub at the British Library.  The full service will enable \nusers to download the full text of the selected items in secure format and in the \nform intended by the authors. \nWithin   the   envisaged   full   service,   institutions   can   submit   their   e-theses \nmetadata or full content directly to the e-theses repository (Ethos central hub \nrepository). Alternatively, EThOS can harvest the metadata or full content form \ninstitutional repositories. EThOS, courtesy of the British Library, also provides a \ncost-effective digitisation service for theses produced on paper. \nWhere thesis content is supplied to EThOS, the thesis and the metadata will be \npreserved by the British Library. This includes taking a copy of the thesis, \nstoring   it  on   a   secure   server,  and  applying  any  preservation   techniques \ndeveloped as part of the British Library\u2019s mandatory role in e-legal deposit for \nother document types e.g. e-journals, e-books, etc. There is no guarantee of \npreservation in cases where metadata only is supplied. \nExplicit research into how this level of preservation can be achieved was not \nwithin the scope of the project, although preservation is mentioned in numerous \nsections of the EThOS toolkit. The toolkit shows how theses at a given \ninstitution can be accessed via EThOS, from the British Library or from an \ninstitutional (or consortium) repository. \n\u2022 EThOS Toolkit   \nSustainability of an EThOS service is covered within the Business Case section \nof the Toolkit. The need for cultural change to appreciate the asset value of e-\ntheses is also discussed, highlighting the fact that an increase in the level of use \nof e-theses material is of significant benefit to the institution in terms of \npromoting its research profile.\nRepository Bridge\nThe Repository Bridge project examined the interaction between a regional \ntheses repository based at the National Library of Wales and pilot institutional \nrepositories   at   University   of   Wales   Aberystwyth   and   University   of   Wales \nSwansea. It developed repository software and tools allowing for full interaction \nbetween   the  DSpace  or  EPrints  repositories   and  FEDORA  open   source \nsystems to migrate and store items in a persistent manner.\nThe project did not address preservation per se but facilitated the transfer of \nmaterials to the National Library of Wales, after which preservation could be \nimplemented.   This   is   very   similar   to   the   EThOS   project   approach.   The \nimmediate   relevancy   of   both   projects   is   thus   more   in   terms   of   asset \nmanagement and capture than preservation. \nRepository Bridge successfully demonstrated a preservation service approach \nfor a specific type of content, electronic theses, showing how these materials \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 72DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\ncould be harvested using OAI and METS from Welsh IRs to a preservation \nrepository at the National Library of Wales.\nSPECTRa\nSPECTRa - the Submission, Preservation and Exposure of Chemistry Teaching \nand Research Data \u2013 has developed a set of customized software tools to \nenable chemists to routinely deposit experimental data in Open Access digital \nrepositories. Data is captured in an open format (wherever possible). Context \nspecific metadata and persistent identifiers are added before the data is \ndeposited in an escrow then institutional repository. Deposit in an OAI-compliant \ninstitutional repository is considered by the project as potentially an effective \nmeans of capturing, preserving, and disseminating the data in accordance with \nOpen Access principles.\nThe project has contributed to preservation knowledge through exploration of \nthe practical use of persistent identifiers (PIs) and transference of PIs between \nrepositories. The cultural challenge of persuading researchers to deposit and \nthus preserve potentially sensitive or commercially valuable data is addressed \nthrough the idea of an escrow or dark archive; this enables researchers to \ndeposit   data   straightaway   whilst   preserving   exclusive   access   to   it   for   a \ndesignated period of time. \n6.2 Institutional Records Management programme (2003)\nDPAM was part of a wider Digital Preservation and Records Management \n(DPRM) programme. DPRM funded another programme \u2013 the Institutional \nRecords management programme \u2013 that aimed to help both FE and HE \ninstitutions implement institutional records management programmes that would \nmeet the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (2000) and conform to \nestablished good practice for the management of records and digital assets \nthroughout their life cycle. Several of the projects included a digital preservation \nand asset management component.\nA Flexible Framework for Institutional Records Management (AFFIRM)\nLed by the City of Bristol College, this project developed a workbook to assess \nrecords management practices in an institution and how they may impact on an \ninstitution\u2019s ability to meet the government\u2019s compliance targets. \nDeveloping records management programmes in FEIs\nThis   project   investigated   how   records   management   programmes   can   be \ndeveloped to ensure the good management of records in all formats within all \nthe FEIs in the North East of England through collaboration with the Northern \nColleges Network.\nElectronic records management training package\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 73DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nThis project designed, developed and tested an ERM training package for all \nstaff in HEIs and FEIs to provide a tool to help inculcate good practice. It also \ndeveloped   a   web-based   training   package   which   provides   a   step-by-step \nassessment tutorial approach as well as the ability to search, pick and choose \nindividual topics.\nEstablishing good practice in FE records management\nLed by John Wheatley College, this project used the Model Action Plan (for \nachieving compliance with the Lord Chancellor's code of practice on the \nmanagement of records) as an audit tool to audit institutional progress in \nestablishing good practice for records management (paper and digital)\nManaging employee records\nThis pilot study explored the management of employee records, defined the key \nrecord series in human resource management activities, and refined retention \nguidelines for the JISC Study of the Records life cycle model.\nManaging primary research data & records\nThis project investigated practical implementation of the generic guidelines for \nmanaging the records of the research function from the Study of the Records \nlife cycle. It also examined and documented the issues arising from this \ninvestigation and any solutions\/strategies for addressing them.\nModel action plan in a FE context\nLed by Loughborough College, this project looked at the range of issues \nsurrounding   compliance   with   the  Model   Action   Plan  by   analysing   it   and \nexamining the degree to which it could realistically be applied to a typical FE \ncollege.\nNorth Wales Records Management Consortium\nThis project researched the needs of Human Resources (HR) Departments' \nclients and produced best practice guidelines for the types of records which HR \ndepartments should be keeping and for how long.\nRecords life cycle for planning & strategy\nThis project tested the practical application of the planning and strategy-related \nthemes from the Study of the Records life cycle by developing and commencing \nthe implementation of a retention schedule for planning and strategy records \ncreated throughout the University of Edinburgh.\nRecords management and email\nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 74DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\nLed by Loughborough University, this project investigated email management \npractices within the University and developed generic policies for retention and \ndisposal of institutional email. \nRecords management project for UWE\nThis pilot used the revised Study of the Records life cycle report (2003) as a \nmodel to produce an institutional retention schedule for the areas of Widening \nParticipation and Governance.\nRecords management project for Warwick\nThis pilot used the revised Study of the Records life cycle report (2003) as a \nmodel to produce an institutional retention schedule for personnel management \nrecords.\nResearch Records\nThis project at the University of East Anglia piloted the research records \nretention section of the  Study of the Records life cycle  and explored issues \nsurrounding   the   management   and   preservation   of   data   in   the   electronic \nenvironment, particularly electronic research datasets.\nRetention of electronic research data\nThis project created a retention schedule for primary research data in paper and \nelectronic   form,   created   at   the   London   School   of   Hygiene   and   Tropical \nMedicine.\nStudent assessment records\nThis pilot case study tested the applicability of the generic retention findings \nrelating to student assessment in the  Study of the Records life cycle  at \nNorthumbria University. \nWeb records management project\nThe MERIT \u2013 Managing Electronic Records in Teaching \u2013 project identified \ngood practice for managing web-based electronic records at Brunel University \nand developed a supporting retention and disposal schedule for records, \nregardless of their formats. \nWhat is a student record?\nThis case study project explored the concept and content of a student record \nand made a number of recommendation surrounding the destruction and \npreservation of student record in data in paper and electronic form. \nMAUREEN PENNOCK, DCC 75DPAM PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS STUDY: PART II \u2013 PROGRAMME SYNTHESIS JANUARY 2008\n6.3 Related International initiatives\nProjects had links with a number of international experts in their respective \nfields, most of who are acknowledged in project final reports.
