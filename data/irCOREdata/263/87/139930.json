While the full\nEuropean Commission study covered many aspects of \u201cAviation in the EU\u201d (European\nCommission, 2005), this paper focuses on EU network and low cost carriers and also\nchanges in consumer demand for air transport. The paper uses published literature to\nexamine and establish the current position with respect of network and low cost carriers and\nconsumer demand. This analysis is then used to develop possible future market scenarios.\nThe likelihood of these scenarios coming into reality was then examined using a two stage\nDelphi survey of aviation experts.\nEU Air Transport in the first five years of the 21st Century\nThe major part of the European airline industry was in difficulty before the traumatic events\nof September 11th 2001. A number of factors had started to impact adversely on the\nindustry\u2019s financial fortunes from 2000 onwards. A slowing down in key economies, such\nas those of Germany and Japan, as well as several more in Europe led to a slowing in traffic\ngrowth. The collapse of the dot.com boom undermined business confidence which in turn\nimpacted the demand for business travel. At the same time in many long-haul markets\nMason & Alamdari 3\novercapacity was becoming a serious problem. This overcapacity and the very rapid\ngrowth of low-cost operators, especially in intra-European markets, were creating strong\ndownward pressure on average fares and yields. Yet costs were rising. Between October\n1998 and October 2000 fuel prices doubled, while labour costs were rising as new wage\nagreements were negotiated in the aftermath of the very profitable years of 1995 to 1999.\nThe events of September 2001 turned a growing crisis into disaster as traffic levels in many\nkey markets collapsed, more especially on the North Atlantic. Sabena and Swissair filed\nfor bankruptcy. Most of Europe\u2019s scheduled airlines posted large losses or severely\ndiminished profits for 2001. Only the large low-cost carriers, Ryanair and easyJet, bucked\nthe trend by showing increased profits.\nThe invasion of Iraq early in 2003, followed by the SARS epidemic in the Far East, hit\nMiddle East and Asian routes. But as traffic growth started to accelerate again in 2004, a\nnew challenge, the rapid rise in fuel prices began to undermine airline profitability once\nmore. Against this turbulent and unstable market environment since 2000 the financial\nperformance of Europe\u2019s airlines was varied.\nNetwork airlines\nMason & Alamdari 4\nThe position of the top ten EU airlines, in relation to their share of total Available Seat\nKilometres (ASK) and departures within the EU in 2004, is illustrated in Table 1. Clearly,\nBritish Airways, Lufthansa and Air France are the principal carriers in the EU market.\nThese three carriers are responsible for over half the total ASK and over 40% of weekly\nflights operated by the EU network airlines. If KLM\u2019s operation is added to that its owner,\nAir France, 61% of ASK and 47% of departures are performed by the top three carriers.\nThe rest of EU airlines offer much smaller shares of total capacity.\n{TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE}\nFigure 1 illustrates the financial performance of EU airlines. It is of interest to note that EU\nairlines have always struggled to make any profits on intra-European routes, however their\noperations on these routes have been vital to feed traffic onto their more profitable long\nhaul routes. The profitability of European operations is a major issue for all EU network\ncarriers, especially in recent years when they have faced very tough competition from the\nlow costs carriers. The profitability of long haul routes has encouraged carriers to focus on\nthese types of routes in order to improve profitability.\n{FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE}\nFigure 2 illustrates the EU airlines intra-European RPK as a percentage of their total\noperations. While carriers such as KLM, British Airways and Air France are less dependent\non intra-European traffic, others such as Luxair and Air Malta have been mainly operating\nMason & Alamdari 5\non intra-European routes. Clearly, this latter group of carriers are more exposed to the\nthreat of low cost airline competition than others.\n{FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE}\nAnalysis of EU operations by airline shows that while the largest carriers (measured by\nASK) have increased capacity at a lower rate, and in some cases they have made cut-backs,\nthe smaller operators have increased their capacity at a higher rate. For example, over the\nfive year period, 1999-2004, British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France have increased\ntheir ASK by an average annual rate of 1%, 6% and 4% respectively while the number of\ndepartures have changed by -2%, 2% and 4% (OAG, 1999 and OAG, 2004). Over the\nsame period, Austrian and Spanair increased their ASK at an average rate of 14% and 9%\neach year and departures at a rate of 20% and 17%. It is noticeable that the large East\nEuropean airlines, LOT, Malev and Czech have been adding flights at an average rate of\n10% to 13% per year.\nLow cost carriers\nThe low cost airline sector in Europe has grown dramatically since Ryanair first started\noperating as a low cost carrier (LCC) in 1991, and easyJet established in 1995. The 9\/11\nterrorist attacks acted as a catalyst for a dramatic change in the structure of the UK airline\nMason & Alamdari 6\nindustry. While British Airways maintained short haul business fares and reduced capacity\nfor leisure travellers, easyJet and Ryanair reduced their fares and built capacity. EasyJet in\nparticular took BA\u2019s capacity reduction at Gatwick as an invitation to establish a base at\nLondon\u2019s second airport.\nIn 2002 and 2004, as the UK market began to become crowded following the arrival of\nBuzz, bmibaby, MyTravelLite and Jet2, among others, consolidation occurred as easyJet\nbought out BA\u2019s subsidiary Go and Ryanair purchased KLM\u2019s subsidiary Buzz.\nContinental Europe is following suit with a rapid burst of high market growth, which is\nexpected to be followed by a levelling off and consolidation. Indeed, according to Credit\nSuisse First Boston, LCCs in 2004 accounted for 20% of European airline passengers, and\n43% of the domestic UK market (Travel Weekly, 2004).\nLCC passenger traffic is estimated to have totalled 94.6 million in 2004. Table 2 shows the\n10 largest European LCCs in terms of available seat-kms in June 2004. EasyJet and\nRyanair are, by some degree, the largest LCCs in Europe but Air Berlin is not far behind in\nsize. Air Berlin still operates a considerable number of charter\/leisure flights, which are\nincluded in the table.\n{TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE}\nFigure 3 shows the percentage of scheduled seats on domestic and intra-EU routes provided\nby LCCs for each of the original 15 Member States.\n{FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE}\nMason & Alamdari 7\nThe addition of ten countries to the European Union has meant that there has been a lot of\nactivity in the accession countries as LCCs look to establish a presence, while a number of\nhome country start-ups have looked to gain entry into the market (including Wizz Air in\nPoland and SkyEurope in Slovakia and Hungary). By the summer of 2004 the LCC sector\nhad grown in number to around 50 airlines, according to the European Low Fares Airline\nAssociation (Airline Business, 2004). However, aside from easyJet and Ryanair most LCCs\nwere either loss making or generating only very marginal levels of profit. LCCs not\noperating profitably in 2004 included Hapag Lloyd Express, Norwegian, Sterling,\nThomsonfly and Virgin Express. Germanwings claimed to have reached break-even in\n2004, while Air Berlin earned a profit of less than 10 million euros on a turnover of 1.05\nbillion euros.\nKey changes in passenger behaviour\nEconomic growth, business confidence, people\u2019s desire to travel and price are the key\ndrivers of demand for air travel. The increase in globalisation and freedom of movement of\npeople and goods within and between regions, are positive factors affecting demand.\nMason & Alamdari 8\nIt appears that leisure travel is growing faster than business travel. For example, Table 3\nshows leisure travel into and out of six principal UK airports to a number of European\ncountries growing more quickly than business travel. In 1996 the leisure market\nrepresented 55.8% of the passengers, however over the seven year period leisure travel\ngrew more quickly (at 9.4% pa) than business travel (just 2.5% pa) and by 2003 the leisure\nmarket represented 66.6% of the market.\n{TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE}\nThese changes in market structure are mainly attributable to the growth of the low cost\ncarrier sector which has led to a fall in yield. Changes in both the business travel and\nleisure markets will be considered below.\nThe business travel market\nThe business travel market has seen a marked change in recent years but remains vital to\nthe airline industry. The airline industry has long relied on the business travel market as a\nmajor source of profit. Although only 15% of the IATA airlines\u2019 capacity is allocated to\nBusiness Class, it generates 28% of revenue. More importantly, the operating profit margin\nfrom Business Class in 2002 was 29% compared to just 5% from Economy Class (IATA,\n2003).\nMason & Alamdari 9\nFrom 2000 onwards, however, the proportion of travellers using Business Class has been\nfalling. A decline in the take up of business class tickets and increased downgrading\nbehaviour has shown that the business market does display price elasticity. This has been\nparticularly evident in the short haul market with the arrival of low cost airlines. Figure 4\nillustrates the decline in business passengers travelling in business class on a number of\nEuropean airlines. British Airways forecasts that as few as 15% of short haul business trips\nwill be taken in business class by 2006 (Sentance, 2003).\n{FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE}\nThe industry is coming to terms with the fact that a large proportion of passengers have\nchosen price over service (e.g. frills, choice or flexibility). As short haul business travel in\nBusiness Class has fallen, a survey by Company Barclaycard shows that the proportion of\nbusiness passengers that have used low cost carriers for business trips has risen to 71% in\n2004\/5 compared to just 28% in 1998\/9 (see Table 4, Company Barclaycard, 2004\/5). This\nis due not only lower fares but the fact that business passengers have more choice of\nbusiness destinations by low cost airlines.\n{TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE}\nIATA\u2019s Corporate Air Travel Survey (IATA 2004) shows (Figure 5) that price has become\nthe principal determinant for short haul business travellers with FFP points and convenient\nschedule being next most important.\nMason & Alamdari 10\n{FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE}\nFor long haul travel, seat comfort, price and FFP seem to be the principal purchase factors,\nalthough price would seem to be relatively less important than for short haul travel.\nSatellite and electronic communication technology can be seen as having both a generation\nand substitution impact on the demand for business travel. The ability provided by\ntechnology to communicate effectively with business partners and customers anywhere in\nthe world can be seen as leading to a growth in business travel as executives travel\nincreasingly far afield to conduct business. In this way communication technology can be\nseen as a travel generator. However the ability to conduct business effectively with IP\nbased technologies like web-casting and file sharing office suites, and video- and tele-\nconferencing may suppress the need to travel for business. Face-to-face sales meetings are\nunlikely to be easily substituted by electronic communication, whereas internal project\nmeetings are more likely to be able to be conducted online.\nThe leisure travel market\nEuropeans tend to enjoy long paid annual leave (see Table 5) Although there is some\nvariation in leave entitlements among states, with those in Western Europe tending to enjoy\nmore generous holiday provision than their neighbours in the East, a large proportion of the\npopulation in all of them take advantage of their holiday entitlement. This should certainly\nhave a positive impact on air travel within and from Europe.\nMason & Alamdari 11\n{TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE}\nIn recent years there has been a trend towards a greater number of shorter trips by European\ntravellers. Traditionally, a single long holiday each year was the norm. However, there\nseems to be a growing trend to split the annual holidays and take shorter breaks. Table 6\nillustrates the annual growth rate in the number of short and long holidays. It can be seen\nthat short breaks are increasingly popular in the majority of the European countries in the\nsample.\n{TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE}\nIn recent years there has been a greater growth in travel within Europe than to countries\noutside Europe. For example, in 2003, traffic from UK to Europe increased by 8.9%\ncompared to 2.5% on long haul trips. This compares with an annul growth rate of 7.3% to\nEurope and 6.9% on long haul between 1993 and 2000. The slow growth in traffic on long\nhaul routes could be due to concerns about health (e.g. SARS, DVT), terrorism and security\nin recent years.\nThe internet has had a profound impact on the way consumers search for and book their\nholidays. The fact that the majority of bookings with low cost airlines are made through the\ninternet has led to the growth in popularity of this channel, and in turn has made\nMason & Alamdari 12\ncomparison of airline prices much easier. This is one of the contributory factors to the\ndecline in airline average prices. The trend in leisure passengers indicates that they expect\nand will continue to expect low fares. Low fares have been the main stimulus for growth in\nleisure travel, with leisure passengers being prepared to switch destination for good deals.\nResearch scenarios\nFollowing this brief review the following scenarios were constructed to be assessed in a\nDelphi survey of air transport industry experts:-\n\uf0b7 The largest network carriers will come to dominate the European airline industry by a\ncombination of natural growth, alliances, and merger and acquisition activity\n\uf0b7 Smaller network carriers will need to find defensible niche roles or are likely to reduce\nin importance or be subsumed within the networks of the dominant European carriers\n\uf0b7 Network carriers will address the fundamentally poor economics of short haul feeder\nservices into hubs by increasingly using franchised feeder services and partners\n\uf0b7 In long haul markets, business travellers will increasingly put higher value on business\nclass services\nMason & Alamdari 13\n\uf0b7 In short haul markets business class products will disappear as an insufficient number\nof business travellers are prepared to pay for them.\n\uf0b7 As technology continues to improve, business travellers will increasingly embrace web\nand video based conferencing solutions to substitute for some business trips\n\uf0b7 Growth in long haul leisure travel destinations will grow faster than short haul\ndestinations\n\uf0b7 Leisure trips will get of increasingly shorter duration.\nMethodology\nTo forecast the EU air transport market of 2015 a Delphi study was conducted with experts\nwithin the EU air transport field.\nThe Delphi study technique is a communication structure aimed at producing detailed\ncritical examination and discussion of issues. Developed in the 1950s and 60s by the Rand\nCorporation, the technique was designed to elicit the opinions of experts in a particular\nfield in a systematic way (Sackman, 1974). It has been described as a \u201csuccession of\nMason & Alamdari 14\niterative brainstorming rounds\u201d (Jantsch, 1967), and is well suited to forecasting complex\nproblems and is an excellent tool for gaining input from recognised sources of expertise.\nLinstone and Turoff (1975) note that at the outset the technique was used mainly for\ntechnological forecasting, however it has been applied across a number of fields of research\nincluding economics, operational research, philosophy, psychology, sociology and\nstatistics. Examples of research problems that the Delphi technique has been applied to\ninclude; marketing expenditure effectiveness (Kotler, 1970), the demand for telephony\n(Day, 1973), forecasting economic conditions (Decker, 1974), and political science (Pavitt,\n1972).\nThe Delphi method involves the recruitment of a number of field \u201cexperts\u201d and uses an\niterative process to attempt to reach consensual forecasts. The experts and their\ncontributions are anonymous so that each expert\u2019s view is given considered equally. The\nprocess involves collecting answers to a number of questions posed to each of the experts.\nIn the first round each expert is expected to provide an answer to each question and also a\njustification for their answer along with any assumptions made. The research team then\ndistil the answers and feedback a summary of the responses and justifications with the\nentire group. In the second round, the experts then consider the strength of the various\nanswers and re-assess their own answers. In this way over a number of iterations it is likely\nthat the views of the experts will coalesce and a degree of consensus will be achieved.\nMason & Alamdari 15\nThe Delphi approach enables the communication between panel members of diverse and\npotential divergent opinions. The technique reaps the benefits of group decision making\nwhile insulating the process from the limitations of group decision-making and undesirable\ninteraction effects; e.g., over-dominant group members, lobbying, or \"bandwagonism\"\n(Cline, 2000). While there are some clear advantages with the approach, conducting a\nDelphi study can be very time consuming. The requirement of the experts to spend time to\ndescribe their views and to provide supporting arguments, the requirement of the research\nteam to distil the submissions of the experts at the end of each round, and the iterative\nnature of the approach means that the whole process can take many months. Computer\nbased elicitation of answers, particularly where experts are dispersed geographically, can\nreduce the time taken to collect answers. However, persuading experts in their field to\nspend time completing repeated rounds of surveys can be difficult. Linstone and Turoff\n(1975) summarise eight pitfalls that can befall a Delphi study including the tendency for\nforecasters to use a sub-conscious discounting rate in their calculations, to simplify the\ncomplex and to rely on panel experts that do not have a wide view of system being\nconsidered. They also note the potential to come to erroneous conclusions due to the\nprocess of making respondents anonymous. Where a particularly insightful expert has a\nopinion that opposes the majority of the panel this, perhaps accurate forecast, may be lost\nas other panellists coalesce around the alternative view (Linstone and Turoff, 1975).\nFor this study a number of key air transport industry experts were invited to participate in\nthe Delphi panel. Sixty-one industry experts working in senior roles for airlines (network,\nMason & Alamdari 16\nLCC, regional, cargo, and leisure), airports, civil aviation authorities, industry associations,\nconsultancies were contacted by email with an invitation to participate in the panel.\nA questionnaire for the first round of the survey was developed. Statements on which the\npanel were to comment were developed by the research team which included eight faculty\nmembers of the Department of Air Transport at Cranfield University (The authors would\nlike to recognise the participation of P. Morrell, R. Pagliari, I. Stockman, A. Foster, G.\nWilliams, and R. Fewings) and Visiting Professor Rigas Doganis. The developed survey\nwas then sent to industry experts, Andrew Hofton and Chris Tarry to ensure the content\nvalidity of the questionnaire, and that the instructions for the participants were\nunambiguous. Panellists were informed that they would be required to complete two self\ncompletion surveys, the first of which was included with the email. Participants had the\noption of completing the survey online, or by printing the survey and returning their hand\nwritten responses.\nThe first round questionnaire contained 27 statements which respondents asked whether\nthey agreed or disagreed with (respondents could also indicate that they had \u201cno opinion\u201d\nabout a particular statement). Respondents were also asked to provide comments on the\nreasons for the answer given, and to indicate the strength with which respondents held their\nviews. In this way the veracity of the statements in the survey could be examined and\nthereby test various hypotheses about the future of air transport in the EU.\nThe Delphi technique seeks to establish where the panel is in broad agreement on a\nparticular issue. For the purpose of this study, it was decided that if three quarters or more\nMason & Alamdari 17\nof the respondents were in agreement on a particular topic consensus was broadly reached.\nWhere consensus on a topic was not found then the comments provided by the panel was\nused to understanding the reasons for the division in opinion. In these cases new questions\nthat drew on the comments given in the first round were written and used in a second round\nsurvey of the panel members. Again 75% agreement in the second round survey was used\nas a \u201cbroad consensus\u201d threshold\nThe approach to ask respondents to rate the strength of their views has been used in a\nnumber of Delphi Studies (e.g. Ludlow, 1975, Hamoen, 1998, Hummel, 2002). In this\nstudy respondents were asked to rate the strength of their view on a five point Likert style\nscale with a score of 5 being \u201cVery strongly held view\u201d to 1 equal to a \u201cVery weakly held\nview\u201d. To assess the strength with which the majority held their view, the average score\nwas calculated and presented in the findings. The higher the score for strength of view the\ngreater the confidence the researchers had in the veracity of the majority expert view.\nResults\nTwenty-six of the group of experts invited to join the Delphi panel responded to the first\nsurvey stage. This represents a response rate of 43%. In some studies where the panel is\nhighly concerned with the subject area a very high response rate has been achieved. For\nexample in a small study of proactive contracting in US Air Force a response rate of 87% in\nMason & Alamdari 18\na panel of 15 was achieved (Wellman, 2003) where as in studies where the experts are\ndrawn from a larger group and the interest in the findings of the report are less directly\nrelated to the experts the response rate is unsurprisingly lower. For example in a study of\ndrug-abuse policy (Jillson, 1975), forty-five experts were invited to participate and twenty-\nfive completed the two rounds (55%). In this case the importance of the study to the experts\nwould be limited as the results would have little commercial value to the participants\nthereby reducing the likely response rate. Delbecq et al (1975) suggest that the panel size of\na homogeneous group of ten to fifteen participants is adequate. Given that all respondents\nwere working in the air transport industry it was felt the sample was sufficient.\nThe panel reached consensus on 11 of the 27 statements in this first round. Where\nconsensus was not reached, the written opinions and the strength of the confidence in the\nreplies given, were used to develop new statements more likely to attain a consensual view.\nA statement in the first survey was somewhat ambiguous, and this was split into two\nseparate statements for the second round. Consequently a second stage survey with 14 new\nstatements was sent to the panel of 25 respondents for completion. In the second stage\nconsensus was once again defined 75% agreement.\nNetwork carriers\nMason & Alamdari 19\nTable 7 shows the results of the first stage of the Delphi study concerning network carriers.\nThese are the statements for which consensus were reached. The results show broad\nconsensus to the view that the difficulty network carriers face in short haul markets will\nmean that these carriers will increasingly focus on longer haul markets, and use franchise or\nsmall alliance partners to feed their long haul networks.\n{TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE}\nAnother scenario proposed to the Delphi panel suggested that as network carriers will never\nbe able to achieve the cost structures of the low cost carriers in their short haul markets,\nnetwork carriers will increasingly focus on long haul markets where they can derive\nsustainable profit streams. The network carriers will pull out of a significant proportion of\ntheir short haul markets, remaining in only very large short haul markets or on routes where\nthere is large proportion of business travellers. The network carriers will increase their use\nof smaller airlines to feed their long haul routes. The feeder airlines may be niche\/regional\nairlines that have cost structures that are suited to this role. A large proportion of Delphi\nexpert agreed that large network carriers will increasingly migrate to long haul routes, and\nthey will make greater use of franchisee or smaller alliance partners in feeding traffic to\ntheir long haul services.\nAlthough focusing on long haul routes could increase the opportunity to serve more high\nyielding passengers, it can lead to over capacity and lower yields as more network carriers,\nespecially those from the US, turn their attention to long haul routes. Similarly, the\nMason & Alamdari 20\nexpansion of the Gulf area airlines could be a threat to EU airlines, especially on long haul\nroutes to the Gulf and beyond. As discussed before airlines from Middle East sub-region\nhave ordered the largest number of wide body aircraft to be delivered over the next 10\nyears, including the 51 Airbus A380s ordered by Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways\ncombined. A large majority of respondent experts agreed that such scenarios will be the\nnature of competition in the future. Given that some of the Gulf area airlines are very well\npositioned in their markets, they could compete fiercely with the EU airlines. At the same\ntime, it would not be surprising to witness even more intense competition on North Atlantic\nroutes leading to further overcapacity and lower yields.\nIn the second stage consensus was reached in five of the nine new statements. As network\ncarriers face up to the poor economics of bringing short haul feed traffic into hubs with\nsmall originating markets, there will be fewer main hubs in the EU. A very large proportion\nof experts believe that hub and spoke operations are here to stay as an important component\nof inter-continental travel. However, these hubs will lose their degree of importance as\nmore flights will by-pass hubs in response to increasing demand for non stop services.\nRecent trends in large airline partnerships and alliances and the economics of the industry\nhelped formulate a scenario where the network carrier market in the EU will consolidate\nconsiderably in the next ten years through merger and acquisition (and airline failures)\nresulting in between three and five dominant network carriers. Replies to the Delphi survey\nindicate that the group of experts strongly agreed that in the next 10 to 15 years no more\nMason & Alamdari 21\nthan five large EU based airlines will be around. It was noted that such a trend has already\nstarted with the merger of Air France and KLM, the potential take over of Swiss by\nLufthansa and the close collaboration between British Airways and Iberia.\n{TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE}\nOn the subject of network carriers establishing low-cost subsidiaries, the general belief\nexpressed by the panel is that although this has been employed as a strategy to combat low\ncost airlines, it is unlikely to succeed. It could be used as a short term tactic until the\n\u201cparent\u201d airline can lower its cost base.\nAs the airline network market becomes increasingly dominated by a few large players,\nsmaller network carriers will face acquisition or failure leading to only two or three\nmedium sized airlines surviving. The experts rejected this idea believing that these airlines\nwill carry on by focusing on niche markets. They also rejected the idea that these airlines\nwill focus on feeding traffic to large network carriers. However, they agreed that medium\nsize airlines will increasingly adopt low cost business models as this is the only way to\nensure survival.\nThe experts could not agree on the number of cabins required in long haul fleets. A number\nof respondents believed that the three-class service is here to stay but it will be business,\nMason & Alamdari 22\npremium economy and economy rather than first, business and economy. On the issue of\nEU airlines offering unbundled products, with each element sold separately, there was a\ncomplete division among the respondents.\nHigh speed rail services will be viable alternatives to short-haul point-to-point air links.\nBut where these services connect with the air transport network through integrated airport\nrail-stations, there is an opportunity for cooperation, particularly through the provision of\nrail-based feeder services. The two developments, competition and cooperation, are not\nmutually exclusive and this was reflected in replies from the Delphi panel. Members were\npretty evenly split on the question of competion or complementarity. Some pointed out the\nvalue of cooperation in freeing capacity at airports, but others cited the success of high-\nspeed rail in competing on short-haul intercity routes. A number identified as crucial the\nprovision of fully integrated airport\/railway interchange stations if rail is to be a feeder of\nair transport network.\nAnother area where the experts did not reach a consensus was that of trade union\ncollaboration with airline management. Half the respondents hoped that this would be the\ncase, but the rest disagreed on the basis that the pressure on airlines to make profit would\nnegatively affects job numbers and wages, leading to potential conflict between\nmanagement and employees.\nMason & Alamdari 23\nLow cost\nThe Delphi panel were of the opinion that the while the low cost sector is likely to capture a\nvery significant share of the intra-EU market not all low cost carriers will prosper.\n{TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE}\nThe two statements that the panel agreed with in the first round of the survey was that more\nthan half of intra-EU traffic would be carried by low cost carriers by 2015 and that there\nwill only be two or three large LCCs.\nThe forecast of the size of the market is broadly in line with other studies that have forecast\nthe future size of the low cost carrier market, and how far the segment will penetrate the\nnetwork carrier market. For example, the European Low Fares Airlines Association\n(ELFAA) forecasts that low cost traffic in Europe will be 40% of the market by 201010,\nwhile TUI estimates the low cost sector to be 33% of the market in 201011. However, the\nDelphi panel is of the view that the LCC share of the intra-EU market will be even larger\nthan these other forecasts. When asked about EU policies to limit regional or airport\nsubsidies, the view of the panel (in the second stage) was that the removal of any such aid\nwould have only a minor impact on the growth of the market.\n10 Liberalisation of European Air Transport: The benefits of low fares airlines to consumers, airports, regions\nand the environment, ELFAA, 2004\n11 Wolfgang John, Trends in leisure travel: What holds for the future? 8Th Hamburg Aviation Conference, Feb\n2005\nMason & Alamdari 24\nThe low cost segment has already seen a large proportion of failures and take-overs in the\nlast couple of years. It is likely as the segment grows towards maturity throughout its\nEuropean markets that there will be further consolidation. The Delphi panel thought that\nthe sector will be dominated by a small number of large players. There seem to be\nsignificant economies of scale in the low cost sector. These include the potential for large\ndiscounts for significant aircraft purchase deals, maintenance and ground handling. There\nalso seems to be first mover advantage in the market. We have seen the successful\nestablishment of new bases of some very large low cost carriers in markets outside their\nhome countries, while new start-ups are finding it increasingly difficult to enter markets\nwhere other low cost carriers have already established. This view is also supported by\nevidence from the US market where three carriers dominate the sector. As to the numbers\nof other LCCs in the market, the panel did not reach a consensus. More than 60% of the\npanel, however, did think that more than 10 smaller\/niche carriers would exist in the market\nthroughout the research period, although volatility in the market would mean the individual\nplayers are likely to change.\n{TABLE 10 ABOUT HERE}\nThe Delphi panel, in the second stage, did not seem to think that as low cost carriers\nincrease their network coverage they would enter into codesharing or interlining\narrangements with network carriers. The reasons given were: the lack of slots at hub\nairports; the necessity of LCCs to breakaway from their normal model to enable such\nMason & Alamdari 25\nformal arrangements; and the fact that many LCCs prefer to fly to secondary airports. This\nwould imply that in the future air transport market will have two quite separate systems:\npoint to point short haul services mainly provided by LCCs; and interconnecting networks\nprovided by traditional carriers.\nThe panel was split on whether LCCs would introduce facilitated online connections. This\nis a facility offered already by Southwest in the US and with a significant number of\npassengers \u201cself-connecting\u201d at the main bases for LCCs (e.g. Stansted) the networks of the\nlarge LCCs are becoming sufficiently large to warrant such a development in the EU\nmarket.\nMarket behaviour\nThe fall in value placed on short haul business class travel and large numbers of travellers\ndowngrading to economy class tickets or using low cost carriers suggested that business\nclass service in short haul markets are likely to be withdrawn. The Delphi panel were in\nbroad agreement with this scenario, and therefore we conclude that by 2015 business class\nproducts will no longer available for intra-EU travel.\nAs video conferencing technology and other forms of web-based communication tools get\nincreasingly sophisticated, it was felt that air travel, particularly for business related\npurposes may in someway be impacted. However, the panel were clear in their view that\nMason & Alamdari 26\nvideo-conferencing would not limit the growth of air travel within the time frame of the\nstudy. The written comments indicated that while this technology may reduce the demand\nfor some trips, the availability of such communication devices would lead to traffic\ngeneration which would either outstrip the substitution effect or be at least neutral.\nThe desk research highlighted the growth in shorter-duration holidays. The panel were in\nnear total consensus when considering this issue. The results show that the panel believes\nthe trend towards a greater number of, shorter-duration holidays will continue throughout\nthe study period.\n{TABLE 11 ABOUT HERE}\nThe desk research noted the establishment of business class only services on some long\nhaul routes. In the first stage of the survey the panel were asked whether such services\nwould become \u201ccommonplace\u201d. The comments indicated that this was unlikely and that\nsuch services were more likely to develop in some niche markets. The revised statement\nused in the second stage of the Delphi study asked whether such services were likely to\nsucceed but only in a \u201climited number of inter-continental routes\u201d. The panel strongly\nagreed with the revised statement indicating that the future market is likely to see such\nservices continue and perhaps grow, but they will only operate in a fairly small number of\nmarkets. One respondent thought these are likely to be \u2018the trunk routes only, where the\nvolumes will allow for the level of schedule to make the product a realistic & consistent\nbusiness choice for passengers\u2019.\nMason & Alamdari 27\nRegarding the growth of long haul holiday markets, the panel once again did not reach\nconsensus. Most panellists thought that the market would grow more quickly than the\nshort haul holiday market (but from a significantly lower base), but prices, exchange rates,\nand the availability of low cost flights to short haul destinations were all noted as issues\nthat impact long haul\u2019s comparatively higher growth rate over short haul holidays.\n{TABLE 12 ABOUT HERE}\nConclusions\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the elements affecting the market structure and\nfinancial viability of European air transport over the next 10-15 years. A Delphi study\napproach was a suitable method drawing together the views of industry experts to assess\nveracity of hypotheses about how network carriers, low cost carriers and airline customers\nin the forecast time frame. The results of the Delphi experts suggest that business\ntravellers will increasingly seek better value for money leading to the end of business class\nservices in short haul markets and leisure travellers taking advantage of low fares to\nvacation more frequently both in the EU and further abroad. The airline market is likely to\nconsolidate into a small number of very large network carriers and a similarly small number\nMason & Alamdari 28\nof very large low cost carriers. The surviving low cost carriers will prosper and eventually\ncarry about half of intra-EU traffic. Feeder services into main hub airports will\nincreasingly be operated by lower cost based franchised partner airlines. There will\ncontinue to be an independent role for the small and medium sized European carries, by\nfocusing on point-to-point markets, and feeding traffic to larger network airlines. High-\nspeed rail could also provide feed into hubs where the infrastructure allows that, but\nelsewhere is likely to compete with short haul air services. Competition for network\ncarriers will continue to be intense on major long haul markets. Services to Gulf and\nbeyond will become increasingly vulnerable to competition from Gulf area airlines due to\ntheir large expansion in capacity.\nReferences\nAirline Business, (2004), \u201cCost Conscious\u201d, Airline Business, October, pp. 33 \u2013 36.\nAssociation of European Airlines, (2004), \u201cYearbook\u201d, Association of European Airlines,\nBrussels.\nCline, A., (2000), Prioritization using Delphi Technique, White Paper, Carolla\nDevelopment, Carrolla.com\nDay, L.
