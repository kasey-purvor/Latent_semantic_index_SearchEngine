Introduction\n[2] Optical phenomena in the upper atmosphere resulting\nfrom rocket engine operation are caused by the scattering of\nsunlight on dispersed components of the combustion prod-\nucts. Combustion products of solid fuel rocket engines\nalways contain cindery particles, whose composition (soot,\nAl, Al2O3) is determined by the components of the solid\nfuel. However, such phenomena are observed during oper-\nation of liquid fuel rocket engines including simple hydro-\ngen-oxygen fuel. The only mechanism of dispersed particle\nformation in the jets of these motors is a process of water\nvapor condensation [Wu, 1975] due to rapid expansion of\nthe combustion products.\n[3] The dynamics of a gas-dust cloud formed by a rocket\nengine exhaust in the upper atmosphere and features of the\nassociated optical phenomena is determined by the size\ndistribution of the dispersed particles, their lifetime and\ninitial velocities. The sizes of particles, in turn, depend on\nthe process of heat exchange and their evaporation.\n[4] The question of thermal balance and evolution of the\nice particles in the upper layers of the atmosphere has been\nexamined in a number of articles [e.g., Bronshten and\nGrishin, 1970; Kung et al., 1975; Bajbulatov and Ivanija,\n1976]. Bronshten and Grishin [1970] considered the ques-\ntion of thermal balance with reference to noctilucent clouds.\nBajbulatov and Ivanija [1976] examined this problem in\nmore detail for different solid particles (Cu, Fe, C, ice, SiO2,\nMgO) at heights of 60\u2013160 km; however, they did not take\ninto account the loss of energy and change of particle size as\na result of sublimation.\n[5] Kung et al. [1975] were probably the first to offer a\nmechanism of sunlight scattering from the condensed phase\nof combustion products as an explanation of the optical\nphenomena observed during rocket engine operation\n(Saturn IV launcher in the Apollo 8 program). In particular,\nthey considered the process of sublimation of ice particles\nunder conditions prevailing in the upper atmosphere and\nestimated their lifetime. In the equation for thermal balance,\nthe authors took into account heating of particles by IR\nradiation from the Earth in two windows of atmospheric\ntransparency (\u00013.08 and \u00016.1 mm) only and losses of\nenergy from sublimation. These assumptions are valid for\nnighttime conditions; however, as the scattering of sunlight\ncauses the observed optical phenomena, it is necessary to\ntake into account heating of the particles due to absorption\nof sunlight and radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system.\nIn addition, it is necessary to take into account energy losses\ndue to thermal radiation of the particles.\n[6] The process of ice particle sublimation during their\nfast dispersion is important for explaining the propagation\nof a disturbance in the upper atmosphere at large distances\nfrom the rocket trajectory with speeds much greater than\ndiffusion.\n[7] In this work the thermal balance of ice particles in the\nupper atmosphere is examined in view of heating by\nsunlight, radiation from the Earth-atmosphere system and\nenergy losses from thermal radiation and sublimation. The\ninclusion of these processes allows computation of the time\ndependence of size and temperature of the ice particles and\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

The\nequation of thermal balance of an ice particle may be\nexpressed as:\n4=3 p r3 r qT dT \u00bc\u00bc p r2\nZl2\nl1\nc r;l\u00f0 \u00de\n8<\n: Fs l\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe FE-A l\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd\n\u00fe FE-T l\u00f0 \u00de\u0007dl \b 4 p r2 s T4\nZl2\nl1\nc r;l\u00f0 \u00de\n\t Pl l;T\u00f0 \u00dedl\b QSUB\n)\ndt; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere\nr(t) is the particle radius;\nr is particle density;\nT(t) is particle temperature;\nc(r, l) is the absorption factor\nof ice;\nFs(l) is the energy flux of\nsunlight outside the ter-\nrestrial atmosphere;\nFE-A(l) is the energy flux from\nthe Earth-atmosphere\nsystem;\nFE-T(l) is terrestrial thermal\nradiation;\nB(r, T) =\nRl2\nl1\nc (r, l) Pl (l, T) dl is the radiating capacity\nof ice;\nPl (l, T) the spectral dependence\nof thermal radiation, i.e.\nthe Planck function;\ns = 5.67 10\b8 W m\b2 K\b4 is Stefan-Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant;\nQSUB is the energy loss asso-\nciated with sublimation\ndescribed as QSUB == 4\np r2 (P1 (T) \b P) m qS\/\n(2p m k T)1\/2 in accor-\ndance with Landau and\nLifshits [1982];\nm = 3 \u000b 10\b26 kg is the molecular mass of\nwater;\nk = 1.38 \u000b 10\b23 J K\b1 is Boltzmann\u2019s constant;\nqT = 2.09 \u000b 103 J kg\b1 is the specific thermal\ncapacity of ice;\nqS = 2.59 \u000b 106 J kg\b1 is the latent heat of ice\nsublimation;\nP1(T) is the saturated water\nvapour pressure and P\nis the water vapour pres-\nsure around a particle.\n[9] The absorption factor c(r, l) is given by Van de Hulst\n[1957] as c (r, l) = Re {i 8p r (m2 \b 1)\/l (m2 + 2)}, where\nm = n \b ik is a complex parameter of the refraction of ice.\nThe dependence of n and k on l, calculated from the data of\nBohren and Huffman [1982], is shown in Figure 1. Here\nl1 = 0.1 mm and l2 = 10 mm are the limits of integration\ndetermined by the wavelengths for which c(r, l) is known.\nAbsorption is negligible outside the range l1 to l2.\n[10] The equation of a mass balance is\n4p r2 r dr \u00bc\u00bc \b4p r2 P1 T\u00f0 \u00depm=2 p k Tf gdt: \u00f02\u00de\nThe following data were used in the solution of the above\nequations. For heating by sunlight, the dependence of solar\nradiation flux on the Earth atmosphere boundary Fs(l) was\ninterpolated according to Allen [1973]. For heating by\nradiation of the Earth-atmosphere system, radiating models\nof the atmosphere and the Earth-atmosphere system\nconstructed for various fixed values of albedo give different\nestimates of brightness of the Earth-atmosphere system,\nwhich diverge by more than an order of magnitude. The\ndata received from satellite measurements also strongly\ndepend on many parameters (radiation, climate, synoptic,\netc.). Nevertheless, it is possible to take advantage of typical\nvalues of radiation intensity to account for the Earth-\natmosphere\u2019s contribution to the process of sublimation.\nThe spectral brightness data of the Earth-atmosphere system\n[Smerkalov, 1997] within the 0.4\u20130.8 mm wavelength range\ncan be represented with sufficient accuracy by \u0001(l) = A(z)\n(l0\/l)\n3.1, where A(z) is the peak value of spectral brightness\nas a function of solar zenith angle and l0 = 0.4 mm. It is\npossible to neglect radiative heating of the Earth-atmosphere\nsystem with wavelengths less than l0 because the transpar-\nency of the atmosphere and absorption by water at short\nwavelengths is small.\n[11] The flow of the energy absorbed by ice particles may\nbe expressed as\ndQE-A \u00bc dt\nZl2\nl1\n\u0001* l\u00f0 \u00de\u0002 c r;l\u00f0 \u00dedl;\nwhere \u0002 is the solid angle of the sunlit part of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface and \u0001*(l) is the average value of spectral brightness.\nFigure 1. The dependence of the imaginary and real part\nof the refraction factor of water with wavelength calculated\nfrom the data of Bohren and Huffman [1982].\nSIA 8 - 2 PLATOV AND KOSCH: SUBLIMATION OF ICE PARTICLES IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE\n[12] As the phenomena associated with scattering of\nsunlight from the combustion products of rocket engines\nare observed in twilight conditions for solar zenith angles\n>85\u0007, the average peak values of spectral brightness will be\n3\u20137 W m\b2 sr\b1, depending on the type of scattering\nsurface, in agreement with Smerkalov [1997]. In this case,\nthe solid angle in which the diffused light occurs does not\nexceed 0.8p for heights >150 km. Under these conditions,\nthe quantity of energy absorbed by ice particles due to\nradiation of the Earth-atmosphere system does not exceed\n0.5% of the energy due to absorption of sunlight. Thus\nexcluding any special cases, heating by radiation of the\nEarth-atmosphere system can be neglected.\n[13] We now consider heating by thermal radiation of the\nEarth. Thermal radiation of the Earth in the IR range is\npractically completely absorbed in the atmosphere except\nfor several transparent windows. The basic pass band of the\natmosphere occurs in the wavelength range 8\u201313 mm. If the\nthermal radiation spectrum of the Earth can be presented as\na black body with a temperature \u000f300\u0007K, it becomes easy\nto estimate the quantity of energy from this source, which is\nabsorbed by the ice particles:\ndQET \u00bc dt p r2\nZl2\nl1\nc r;l\u00f0 \u00dePl l; 300\u00f0 \u00dedl \u000f 0:3 dQS\n\u00bc 0:3 dt p r2\nZl2\nl1\nc r;l\u00f0 \u00deFS l\u00f0 \u00dedl\n[14] To account for the loss of energy by emission from\nthe ice particles as a function of temperature, the interpolated\nvalues\nRl2\nl1\nc(r, l) P(l, T) dl, calculated for the range 130\u2013\n270\u0007K were used.\n[15] To account for loss of energy by sublimation, equa-\ntion (2) is inspected. (P(T) \b P)\/(2p m k T)1\/2 is the number\nof molecules sublimating in unit time from a unit surface of\na particle. For the conditions prevailing in the upper\natmosphere, evaporation occurs in a vacuum and P = 0.\n[16] The temperature dependence of water vapor pressure\nin the range 0 to \b100\u0007C may be expressed in accordance\nwith data from Goody [1964] as:\nP1 T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\u00bc P T0\u00f0 \u00de T=T0\u00f0 \u00de28:5;\nwhere T0 = 273 K and P(T0) = P0 = 610 Pa.\n[17] Using dimensionless variables x = T\/T0, h = r\/r0 and\nt = t\/t0, we get:\ndx=dt \u00bc\u00bc a\b b B x\u00f0 \u00dex4 \b g P0 x28=h \u00f03\u00de\ndh=dt \u00bc\u00bc \bd x28 \u00f04\u00de\nThe numerical factors used in expression are shown in\nTable 1. Wu [1975] estimated the size of average mass ice\nparticles condensed in a rocket engine exhaust to be about\n20 A\u02da. Stein and Armstrong [1973] made an estimate of 55 A\u02da.\nHowever, estimates of the possible size of the condensed\nparticles ranges up to several microns [Simmons, 2000]. As\nno measurement data of the size distribution of the\ncondensed particles is available, it is necessary to consider\na wide range of initial sizes of the ice particles, at least from\n0.05 up to 1 mm.\n[18] The solution of equations (3) and (4) are given in\nFigures 2 and 3, respectively. We have assumed the initial\ncondition that the expansion of the combustion products\nresult in condensing water vapor forming ice particles with\na temperature of 273\u0007K. From the solution of the equations\nit follows that this assumption does not substantially influ-\nence the results. This is because the strong dependence of\nTable 1.

The temperature\nof the ice particles very quickly (\u00010.2 s) reach a quasi-\nstationary value of \u00010.7 To. The subsequent change in\ntemperature of a particle occurs smoothly in the range\n0.7\u20130.55 To. The change in size of the particles has a\ngreater dependence on the initial size.\n3. Discussion of Results\n[19] The characteristic time of size reduction of the\nparticles to one-third of the original size, corresponding to\nan intensity decreasing of Rayleigh scattered light of \u0001103,\nis from \u0001120 s for rather small particles (r = \u00010.005 mm) up\nto >200 s for particles with a characteristic size of about\n1 mm. As the dynamic range of optical recording systems\nusually does not exceed 3\u20134 orders of magnitude, the\ncharacteristic sizes of observable rocket exhaust formations\nin the upper atmosphere are limited to about 300\u2013600 km,\ndepending on the size of the particles. This result is\nsubstantiated by several observations [e.g., Vetchinkin et\nal., 1993; Simmons, 2000; Platov, 2001]. Cases of gas-dust\nformations with much greater sizes [Tagirov et al., 2000;\nPlatov, 2001] are associated with special modes of operation\nof solid fuel rocket engines (engine switch-off) and by\npresence of nonevaporating particles (soot, Al, Al2O3) in\nthe combustion products.\n[20] As the expansion velocity of the ice particles in the\nupper atmosphere is much greater than the diffusion speed,\na fast transfer of substances actively participating in\nion-molecular reactions in the ionosphere, connected in\nparticular with formation of large-scale ionosphere holes,\noccurs. We now estimate the distribution of water vapor\nconcentration in the atmospheric region around a rocket.\nAssume M0 is the mass of ice particles with the charac-\nteristic size r0 injected into the atmosphere in unit time by\na rocket engine. The number of molecules evaporated\nduring time interval dt is\ndN \u00bc M0 dt= 4=3 p r30 r\n\u0007 \b\t \n\n4p r t\u00f0 \u00de2 P1 T\u00f0 \u00depm=2 p k Tf gdt:\nIf we accept that the axial velocity of combustion products\nin the atmosphere is V0, which is the rocket velocity, and\nthe radial velocity is U0, it is easy to determine that the\nevaporated mass of water vapor will occupy a volume dW =\np U0 t U0 dt V0 dt. Thus the concentration of water\nmolecules is\nn t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc dN=dW\n\u00bc M0= 4=3 p r0 r\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u00074p h t\u00f0 \u00de2P0 x28pm=2 p k T0\nn o\n=pU0 V0 R t\u00f0 \u00de;\nwhere R(t) = U0t is the distance from the rocket trajectory.\nThe solution of this equation for characteristic values of\nparticle sizes r0 = 1 and r0 = 0.1 mm and M0 = 100 kg s\n\b1,\nV0 = 3000 m s\n\b1 and U0 = 1000 m s\n\b1 is given in Figure 4\nas a dependence upon R(t). As the electron concentration in\nthe ionospheric F layer is 1012 m\b3, it becomes obvious that\nfor radial distances up to 200 km from the rocket trajectory\nthe water molecules concentration as a result of sublimation\nof large enough ice particles (r = \u00010.5 mm) is sufficient to\nperturbate the ionospheric electron density.\n[21] We now examine the validity of the assumptions and\napproximations made earlier. It was assumed that sublima-\ntion in the upper atmosphere occurs practically in vacuum.\nThe water vapor pressure at \u0001160 K amounts to \u00011.5 \u000b\n10\b4 Pa. In the upper atmosphere at heights greater than\n250 km the gas pressure is less than this value [Allen, 1974].\nWater vapor pressure can be neglected above 120 km; hence\nthe assumption made above is good.\n[22] It is implicitly assumed that the ice particles formed\nby the condensation of combustion products have a spher-\nical form. However, this is most unlikely as homogeneous\ncondensation would form crystals of hexagonal or cubic\nshape. However, as the size of the particles considered here\nare small in comparison with the wavelength of the\nabsorbed radiation, our assumption is justified [Van de\nHulst, 1957].\n[23] The extrapolation of water vapor pressure data at\ntemperatures is below 170 K introduces some uncertainty in\nthe calculations. However, this extrapolation is acceptable\nprovided the quasi-static temperature of the particles, deter-\nmined by the balance between heating by sunlight and\nthermal radiation energy losses, does not deviate too much\nfrom this value (T = \u0001150 K).\nFigure 3.

Conclusion\n[25] The time of sublimation of ice particles condensed in\nrocket exhaust is enough for formation of a large-scale gas-\ndust cloud in the upper atmosphere that may be seen as a\nresult of scattering of sunlight in twilight conditions. During\nexpansion of this cloud water vapor is transported some\nhundreds of kilometers from the area of the rocket flight at\nspeeds of \u00012 km s\b1, which considerably exceeds the\ndiffusion speeds of gas components from the combustion\nproducts. The subsequent interaction of water vapor with\natmospheric components results in rapid development of\nlarge-scale disturbances in the ionosphere (formation of\nionospheric holes).\n[26] Acknowledgments.
