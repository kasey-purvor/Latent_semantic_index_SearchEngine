INTRODUCTION \nAcceptance to a bachelor or master programme has traditionally been \nbased on a required (combination of) degree(s), experience and\/or skills. \nHowever, due to increasing internationalisation of students (Ministerie van \nOCW, 2005), changes in secondary school programmes in the Netherlands \n(De Vries & Van der Velden, 2005; Tweede Fase Adviespunt, 2005), the \nintroduction of the bachelor-master structure and the new accreditation \nprocedures by the Treaty of Bologna (Dittrich & Frederiks, 2005; \nOnderwijsraad, 2005), higher education institutions face several tough \n \n* Based upon: \nRienties,  B.,  Tempelaar,  D.  T.,  Waterval,  D.,  Rehm,  M.,  &  Gijselaers,  W.  H.  (2006).  Remedial  \nonline teaching on a summer course. Industry and Higher Education, 20(5), 327-336. \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014721 \nchallenges in selecting the \u201ccorrect\u201d student. According to Ministerie van \nOCW (2005), the average percentage of foreign students in higher \neducation in the Netherlands is 4% and most institutes strive for an \nincreasing internationalisation in the years to come.  \nIn the Netherlands, the two universities with the highest percentage of \nforeign students are University Wageningen (19%) and Maastricht \nUniversity (24%). The experiences at the university with the highest amount \nof foreign students in both absolute as relative numbers show that prior \nknowledge levels of mathematics and economics of foreign students are \nmore diverse and often lower than for students with a Dutch secondary \neducation degree (Rienties, Dijkstra, Rehm, Tempelaar, & Blok, 2005). \nAlthough foreign students formally should be accepted because of the \nTreaty of Bologna, for some (international) students, the lack of prior \nknowledge is too large and remedial teaching before entering a programme \nis desirable. In addition, most students are unable to judge whether they \npossess sufficient prior knowledge and\/or experience to start a bachelor or \nmaster programme (Prins, 1997). \nIn the past, several remedial teaching programmes have been developed \n(e.g. Colloquium Doctum, James Boswell Institute). However, their success \nin terms of students completing the programme is highly dependent on the \nmotivation of students, the involvement of teachers and the learning \nenvironments (Van Leijen, 2005). As higher education institutions now have \nto compete on a European or even global market, offering (only) \nregional\/national remedial courses in a fixed (geographical) location with \ntraditional teaching methods seems to neglect the effects of a changing \nworld (of education). In order to increase the success rates of higher \neducation, an online remedial programme could offer a solution to the \nproblems of (lacks of) prior knowledge.  \nTherefore, in this chapter a general framework for an efficient and \neffective online summer course will be developed. Subsequently, the online \nremedial teaching model will be tested in practice by analysing two online \nremedial teaching courses at Maastricht University, which is part of the \nexperiences of the project Web-spijkereni. Finally, the evaluation results of \nthe summer courses will be used to answer the following three questions: \nHow can students assess their current level of mastery before joining a \n(bachelor) programme? In addition, if the level of mastery of individual \nstudents appears to be low, how can \u201conline summer courses\u201d help to \ntackle these potential deficiencies? And finally, how can online summer \ncourses be designed to increase completion rates of students joining an \nonline summer course? \n  \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 2\n \n 22 \n2. ONLINE REMEDIAL TEACHING MODEL \nVan Leijen (2005) conducted research in various remedial teaching \nprograms in the Netherlands. A programme offered during the summer \nperiod induces an incentive problem as most graduated high school \nstudents have a strong preference to do other things than studying. Hence, \nthe challenge arises to construct a programme that achieves a balance \nbetween study time and time for summer activities in such a way that it \nprovides sufficient motivation to keep students engaged in the course. An \nonline summer course might be able to strike this balance, as it in theory \nshould be possible to teach and learn regardless of time and place. On \nbasis of various research on the use of ICT in education and distance \neducation (Bryant, Khale, & Schafer, 2005; Keegan, 2002; Roblyer & \nWiencke, 2003; Schellens & Valcke, 2005; Vrasidas & McIsaac, 1999) and \nresearch on remedial teaching (Van Leijen, 2005), the following five \naspects should be taken into consideration when an institute aims to design \nand implement an online remedial summer course:  \n \n1. Access and availability 24\/7 online \n2. Adaptiveness \n3. Interactivity \n4. Responsiveness of feedback \n5. Flexible learning method and assessment \n \nAccess and availability 24\/7 online \nAccording to Bryant et al. (2005), there are many definitions about online \nand\/or distance education. Distance education encompasses two important \nelements, namely distance teaching and distance learning. Distance \nteaching regards mainly the way in which instruction is provided, whereas \ndistance learning concerns optimising student learning behaviour (Keegan, \n2002). Various definitions are used for online education. Although in most \nof the definitions terms like \u201cweb-enabled\u201d and \u201conline\u201d point at the way \ninstruction is provided, it does not automatically lead to distance education \n(Bryant et al., 2005). However, in this article the term online (education) is \nused instead of distance education as it allows bridging the limitations of \ntime and geographical distance. In this way, students can work and study \nwhenever they want, or so-called ubiquitous learning. Note that the term \nonline mainly refers to technical educational issues. In order to learn \nindependent of time and place, also organisational and didactical aspects \nhave to be aligned. \n \n  \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014723 \nAdaptiveness \nAs each student is unique, the programme should ideally allow for an \nindividualised learning path based on prior knowledge, learning style and \npreferences of the student (Abdullah, 2003; Doignon & Falmagne, 1999). \nThis means that the module should be flexible in meeting the needs of each \nindividual participant.  \n \nInteractivity \nGenerally, in a face-to-face setting it is assumed that interaction is one of \nthe key issues in the learning process (Vygotsky, 1978). According to \nVrasidas and McIsaac (1999), interaction is also a central component of \nonline distance learning. \u201cA fundamental component of distance education \nis the communication medium\u201d (Bryant et al., 2005, p. 257). Being solely \navailable online, the course and learning environment should stimulate \ninterpersonal contact in order to motivate participants to remain engaged \n(Ronteltap & Eurelings, 2002). However, in comparison to face-to-face \neducation, it is harder to transfer communication elements like body \nlanguage or intonation in a virtual education. Therefore, online courses \nhave to make more intensive use of the available interaction methods \n(Roblyer & Wiencke, 2003). Interaction is not just a technical mechanism; it \nis also a social and psychological way to generate relations. By forming \nsmall groups, students will experience peer-pressure, which forces them to \ninteract more intensively. At the same time, group processes and learning \nprocesses remain clear and manageable for tutors (Schellens & Valcke, \n2005). In a model of Problem-based Learning setting (Moust, Bouhuijs, & \nSchmidt, 2002), it is assumed that tutors together with students are \nresponsible for stimulating interaction as well as stimulating the learning \nprocess.   \n \nResponsiveness of Feedback \nVrasidas & Zembylas (2003) argue that feedback is a crucial factor in the \ninteraction of a course. Besides the fact that it is pedagogically better to \nprovide rapid feedback on performance, it is also important because the \nperiod before the summer course starts is short and often fully planned with \nother activities. \n \nFlexible learning method and assessment \nGiven the fact that learning and assessment methods are subject to \nchange, the programme should be flexible enough (Segers, 2004). \nDepending on the educational vision of an institute, different aspects of the \nmodel can be emphasized. In a more teacher-centred educational vision, \ncommunication between students will be less important.

The model makes a \ndistinction between technology and virtual learning environment (VLE). In \nother words, the model can be adjusted to different educational settings \ndepending on the educational vision. In an individual learning programme, \nthe interaction will mainly take place between the technology and the \nstudent (by offering learning materials, assignments and assessments) as \nwell as between student and lecturer. In a problem-based learning setting, \nthe interaction between students will increase with help of the technology \n(discussion-forums, chat, e-mail, etc.), whereas the lecturer will perform a \ncoaching role. The way in which the student is assessed will essentially \ndepend on the chosen didactical model (Segers, 2004). In addition, the \nonline remedial teaching model will also determine the evaluation method. \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014725 \n3. DESIGN OF ONLINE SUMMER COURSES \nAs Maastricht University has the highest percentage of international \nstudents (24% in 2005) in the Netherlands (Ministerie van OCW, 2005), and \nthe Faculty of Economics and Business Administration has more than 70% \nof enrolments from abroad, the differences in prior knowledge are \nenormous. The experiences how to tackle these problems provides an \ninteresting case-study for higher educational institutes focussing on moving \ntowards internationalisation.  \nMost 1st and 2nd year students in the \u201cregular\u201d curriculum at Maastricht \nUniversity have (some) problems with mathematics and\/or economics \n(Rienties, Dijkstra et al., 2005). Therefore, the first online summer courses \nwere specifically developed for tackling these problems. As the majority of \nthe target group lived abroad, the programme was offered completely \nonline, with no physical presence required. An economics as well as the \nmathematics online summer course were offered twice during the summer \nperiod. This allowed for more flexibility, which enhanced the match between \na student\u2019s efforts to tackle possible deficiencies for the respective topics \nand his\/her other \u201csummer\u201d activities. This enabled participants to work \nanywhere they liked and at times that suit them best. Important to note is \nthat participation was completely voluntary and in no way related to the \nofficial admission procedures of the university. Moreover, participation in \nthe summer course was free of charge and the only bonus was an unofficial \ncertificate and a graduation ceremony and drink. \n3.1 Prior knowledge tests \nA fundamental assumption is that not every student will need an online \nsummer course. Therefore, a so-called online prior knowledge (diagnostic) \ntest was developed before the start of the academic year. The online tests \nof economics and mathematics were available and accessible 24\/7 via the \nInternet and were a combination of exercises in open-question type form \nand self-assessment of mastery of knowledge. Anyone who completed in \nthe online entry test received elaborate feedback via E-mail. If the results \nwere deemed to be below a specified threshold, students were invited to \ntake part in the applicable summer course to remediate the apparent \ndeficiency. If a student was willing to invest 60 to 80 hours to remediate \nhis\/her knowledge deficiency, the student was enrolled in the summer \ncourse.  \nOverall, the economics test was viewed 379 times and 211 prospective \nstudents from 34 different countries, ranging from Spain, Peru, Australia to \nKazakhstan, completed the test. Surprisingly, 151 (71%) prospective \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 2\n \n 26 \nstudents scored below the threshold level for economics. For mathematics, \n230 prospective students took the test and 83% scored below the pre-\ndefined threshold-level. In total 50 students registered for economics and \n55 for mathematics, mostly German students with the basic level \nmathematics (Abitur Grundkurs Mathematik) and no economics. \n3.2 Online summer course economics \nThe online summer course economics was a virtual version of the \ncollaborative Problem-Based Learning (e-PBL) approach used at \nMaastricht University (Rienties, Rehm, & Dijkstra, 2005). The course was \ngiven over a period of six weeks in which students were assumed to work \nfor 10-15 hours per week. There were neither obligatory meetings nor a \nschedule of appointments. The students themselves decided when to work \non a task. They discussed six tasks that covered introductory topics of \neconomics in general (e.g. economic way of thinking), microeconomics \n(e.g. demand and supply model) and macroeconomics (e.g. gross domestic \nproduct, inflation and unemployment). The 50 participants were divided in \nthree groups (depending on the time of enrolment) of 14 to 18 students, in \nline with analyses by Schellens & Valcke (2006) about optimal group sizes \nfor collaborative learning. All groups were guided by two tutors.  \n \nOnline Training \nBecause participants had no experience with the seven-jump method of \nPBL (Moust et al., 2002) and most of them were unfamiliar with using a \nvirtual learning environment, a lot of emphasis was placed upon training \nand schooling. This was a challenge since there was no face-to-face \ncontact between tutors and participants. Therefore, three steps were taken \nto overcome these difficulties. \n1. The six tasks were preceded by \u201cTask 0\u201d. The purpose of this task \nwas to demonstrate students the process of PBL in a discussion \nboard. The coordinators of the course simulated a discussion on a \nrelated, but non-economic topic.  \n2. The summer course manual included a chapter that explained the \ncontent and sequence of the different steps in the seven-jump as \nwell as a manual for the VLE.  \n3. During the first week, extra attention was paid to the first \ncontributions of participants. If mistakes were made, immediate \npositive feedback was given (Schellens & Valcke, 2005). \n  \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014727 \nVirtual Learning Environment \nIn order to participate in the discussion of the tasks, students were given \naccess to the VLE used in Maastricht. ELEUM incorporates most of the \ncharacteristics of the online remedial teaching model. It allows students to \ndo quizzes and give immediate feedback on their results and learning \nprocess (Rienties & Woltjer, 2004; Tempelaar & De Gruijter, 2004). In \naddition, ELEUM has some interactive communication tools like discussion \nboards, chat and E-mail (Ronteltap & Eurelings, 2002). As primary learning \nmaterials, an electronic version of a first year economics book from Parkin \nand Bade (2004) was used, which includes chapters of the book, videos, \ninteractive materials and animated graphs.  \n \nFormative and Summative Assessment \nThe course used various formative as well as summative assessment \nforms. According to Marshall (1999), formative assessment supports the \nlearning process of students without grading, while summative assessment \ngives insight in the (end) level of a student with an accompanying mark. \nThe students had the opportunity to make three formative tests and they \ncould themselves decide when to take the tests. These tests were used to \nprovide the students with feedback on their level of mastery of the learned \nsubjects. The course was concluded with a final summative exam. The \nstudents had to work on a problem similar to the ones they discussed \nduring the course and were asked to answer it by applying the newly \nacquired knowledge. \n \nInteractive communication \nWith regard to the problem of ensuring rapid feedback, interaction tools \nprove to be a very attractive mechanism. The use of a discussion-board (a-\nsynchronous communication) makes it possible for students to interact with \neach other, share new insights and help in case certain aspects need \nclarification This is in contrast to synchronous communication (e.g. chat or \nMSN-messenger), which requires all participants to be online at the same \ntime. By designing a course around a-synchronous communication, a \nsubstantial degree of flexibility is created and this has been extensively \nresearched by Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) \nanalyses (De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van Keer, 2006; Gunawardena, \nLowe, & Anderson, 1997). This allows students to actively participate in a \ndiscussion at their preferred time without running the risk of missing vital \nparts. Moreover, it allows for group dynamics that are missing when a \nstudent has to follow a remedial course alone (Rienties, Rehm et al., 2005). \nHence, a discussion board can be used as a formative assessment tool.  \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 2\n \n 28 \n3.3 Online summer course mathematics  \nThe procedure used for the online summer course mathematics is to a \nlarge extent similar to the economics course. The workload is equivalent, \nnamely 10-15 hours per week in a period of 4 to 6 weeks. In contrast to the \neconomics course, the mathematics course is largely an individual course. \nIt is based on individual learning, where nearly all interaction is between the \nstudent and the learning environment. Students worked with an online \nprogramme (ALEKS), which again assessed the prior knowledge level of \nstudents and afterwards offered a unique individual learning path. This \nprogramme is based on so-called Knowledge Space theorem (Doignon & \nFalmagne, 1999). If a student goes faster (or slower) through the learning \nmaterial, then ALEKS will immediately adapt the learning path. In principle, \nthis implies that the program adapts the learning path depending on \nknowledge, progress and learning style of the student. \nThe lecturer, who is also responsible for the 1st year introduction course \nmathematics in the \u201cregular\u201d curriculum, chose a module which is similar to \nthe complete mathematics programme in Dutch secondary education. \nStudents had to solve mathematical problems and if necessary ALEKS \nprovided hints. Although students worked individually, they could contact \nthe lecturer if the explanations of the program were insufficient or unclear to \nthe student. The pass-fail decision was made based on the endpoint \n(knowledge level) a student achieved. \n3.4 Evaluation \nIn order to analyse whether the two online summer courses were \ndeveloped effectively, an evaluation was used which is based on a protocol \ndeveloped by Kaper, Blok, Brouwer and Wieland (2005). This evaluation \nprotocol takes into consideration the specific demands of flexible education \nwith heterogeneous students. In order to be able to measure the \nexpectations of the participants at the beginning as well as at the end of the \ncourse, online questionnaires were distributed. At the beginning, students \nwere asked about their motives and incentives for participating in the online \nsummer course programme.  \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014729 \n4. RESULTS  \n4.1 Results of online summer course economics \nAccording to the entry questionnaire, students were mainly joining the \ncourse since they were not satisfied with their level of mastery in \neconomics. The students indicated that they liked the idea of working online \nto remediate their knowledge and at the same time liked the opportunity to \ncontact other students as well as the tutor. In general, the participants \nindicated that at the start of the course they received sufficient information \nabout the goal and context of the course. Furthermore, the students clearly \nexpressed their preference for teamwork instead of working individually. \nDuring the course, the students had to collaborate on solving problems \nderived from PBL-tasks. When the summer course started, the students \nbriefly introduced themselves in the \u201cCaf\u00e9\/Small Talk\u201d-section with a picture \nand personal background information. The Caf\u00e9\/Small Talk-section was \nintensively used for getting acquainted with each other, as recommended \nby Roblyer and Wiencke (2003). In addition, it was used for arranging \npracticalities such as \u201chow to find a room?\u201d or \u201cwhere do I apply for a \ngrant?\u201d Thus, the online course also contributed to establishing of fidelity \nwithin the group and with the institution. One can reasonably assume that \nstudents who are more convinced about their choice of study will commit \nmore to the institute and will put more effort in their study. By early fidelity of \nstudents towards the institute, the chance that a student gets isolated in a \nnew environment and drops out the study in a preliminary stage is thus \nreduced. In the beginning, students found it difficult to understand the \nseven-jump. Students placed daily threads and reacted on each others\u2019 \ncontributions. Six weeks later, an average of 370 threads per group were \nplaced, which can be seen as a rough approximation of the intensity of \nusage. The highest performing student placed 27% of the messages and \nthe lowest performing student 2% of the messages.  \nAt the end of the course, an evaluation was conducted to see whether \nthe course matched the expectations of the students (see Table 2.1). \nStudents were very positive about both the functioning of the instructors as \nwell as the online summer course as such. More specifically, students felt \nthat the course had offered them a lot and enabled them to remediate their \nknowledge to such an extent that they feel ready to start in Maastricht \nUniversity. Students worked over a period of six weeks 13 hours per week \nfor the summer course on average. The group of students who did not pass \nonly worked for six hours per week. With regard to the VLE, students found \nthe digital materials to be of very good quality. Moreover, there is evidence \nthat students liked the fact that they could collaborate with each other in this \nsummer course.

Furthermore, students had a strong feeling that the teamwork \nsetting helped them in their process of tackling their knowledge gaps. The \nobservation that increased interactivity in distance education is related to \nhigher student satisfaction (and therefore higher passing rates) has already \nbeen confirmed by earlier findings by Roblyer and Wiencke (2003). \nEventually, 25 out of 50 students passed the course. In comparison to \nother remedial courses (Van Leijen, 2005) and taking into account that \nstudents never physically met one another and that participation was \ncompletely voluntary, a passing rate of 50 per cent can be considered to be \nfairly high. \n4.2 Results of online summer course mathematics \nRegarding the mathematics course, the students indicated at the \nbeginning of the course to be highly motivated and were mainly joining the \ncourse since they were not satisfied with their level of mastery in \nmathematics. Students pointed out that they received sufficient information \nabout the goal and context of the course. In contrast to the economics \nsummer course, there were no questions regarding any form of \ncollaboration, for the aforementioned reasons related to the usage of the \nindividual learning tool of ALEKS. The students indicate to be motivated to \ncomplete the Summercourse as they could work at their own pace. \nIn the end, 29 of 55 (53%) students successfully completed the course. \nAgain, the students were positive about the tutor as well as the course. The \ncourse offered a lot of added value as well as a stimulating environment \nand had useful learning materials.

Students \nworked on average 53 hours during the course. In contrast to economics, \nthey preferred to work individually rather than working together. In table 2.2, \nthe complete evaluation results are given. \nRemarkably, students who participated in both courses judged both \ndidactical scenarios to be adequate. The question which arises is: are \nstudents indifferent about the didactical scenario, or do they judge that \nindividual learning best suits the mathematics summer course, and \ncollaborative learning best suits the economics summer course, and that \nthe designers of both types of summer courses made appropriate choices \nfor the didactical scenarios? \n4.3 Comparing the didactical scenarios \nThe two summer courses are based on completely different didactical \nscenarios. The mathematics course is based on purely individual learning, \nwhere nearly all interaction is between the student and the learning \nenvironment. Neither interaction with peer students takes place nor \nextensive interaction with the tutor. In contrast, the economics course is \nbased on collaborative learning supported by a VLE. One of the aims of \nhaving both summer courses founded in such different learning paradigms \nwas to collect empirical evidence on the appropriateness of both scenarios \nwhen applied for online, distance summer courses. As indicated above, \nboth summer courses appeared to be successful in terms of better \npreparing students with deficient prior knowledge for their regular study. \nComparing drop-out ratios, no strong differences have been found. A \nsimilar remark refers to students\u2019 satisfaction based on the evaluation \nquestionnaire: both courses, and thus both didactical scenarios, achieve \npositive evaluations on all criteria.  \nTo answer this last question, one item in the evaluation questionnaire of \nboth summer courses asked the students to judge the appropriateness of \nthe didactical scenario, with the other didactical scenario as benchmark. In \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 2\n \n 34 \nthe mathematics course, students were asked to express themselves on \nthe statement \u2018I think that I have learned more by individually attending this \ncourse than I would have learned if I had to collaborate\u2019. In contrast to this, \nthe statement has been formulated in the reverse way for the participants of \nthe economics course. This statement received an average score of 3.5 for \nthe mathematics summer course, and a 3.2 score for the economics \nsummer course. Thus, although scores are less pronounced than in most \nother evaluation items, there is a tendency that individual learning is \nregarded more suitable for the mathematics summer course, and \ncollaborative learning most suitable for the economics summer course. \nStudents\u2019 opinion on the appropriateness of the didactical scenario is \ndependent upon success in the summer course. In fact, it is the only \nevaluative statement where a \u201cpassing student\u201d provides an answer that is \nsignificantly different from the answer provided by a \u201cfailing student\u201d. This \nmight indicate that some students fail the summer course because they \nregard the didactical scenario applied in the summer course as suboptimal.  \n5. DISCUSSION \nIn this chapter, the question how prior knowledge tests and online \nremedial summer courses can contribute to mitigating the problems of \nheterogeneous enrolment of students has been dealt with. First of all, an \nonline remedial teaching model was developed. The five success factors \nthat an online remedial course developer should take into account are 24\/7 \naccess and availability via Internet, adaptiveness, interactivity, rapid \nfeedback, and flexible learning methods and assessment.  \nAfterwards, the online remedial teaching model was implemented in \npractice at for two summer courses of the Maastricht University. Before \nstudents were allowed to join one\/both of the courses, they had to make an \nonline prior knowledge test. More than 200 prospective students out of \nmore than 30 countries made use of this possibility. A large amount (\u009575%) \nof the prospective students scored below the threshold on the prior \nknowledge test mathematics and\/or economics. This suggests some proof \nfor our assumption that, due to internationalisation, problems in higher \neducation with regard to prior knowledge in mathematics and economics \nare wide-spread. Eventually, approximately 2 * 50 students took part in one \nor both of the online summer courses. As most (prospective) students of \nMaastricht University live abroad before joining the academic programme, \nthe courses were offered 100% online.  \nAlthough both courses implemented a different didactical scenario, both \nmatched with the online remedial teaching model. The didactical model \nfitted the content of the course of economics and mathematics, respectively \n Remedial Online Teaching on a Summer Course \u014735 \nePBL and working individually with ALEKS. Positively, most of the \nparticipants spent a substantial amount of time on the course and the \npassing rates are at least similar to other experiments of online virtual \nlearning. The student evaluations of both courses were very positive and \nstudents indicated they felt ready to start their study at Maastricht \nUniversity. More specific, there seems to be some evidence that individual \nlearning is regarded more suitable for the mathematics summer course, \nand collaborative learning more suitable for the economics summer course. \nThe implementation of both summer courses was mainly focused on \ndidactical and organizational aspects, since the technical infrastructure was \nalready in place. Both courses are implemented using existing ICT-\ninfrastructures, comparable to other higher education institutes. As long as \nsufficient expertise and resources are invested, the problems \naccompanying the increasing internationalization of students can be \ntackled.  \nFurther research is necessary to prove whether online summer courses \nhave a temporary or structural effect on the (prior) knowledge level of \nstudents. In addition, it remains to be investigated whether the participants, \nin comparison to those who did not take part at the summer course, perform \nbetter in the respective courses in the curriculum. Furthermore, a so-called \n\u201csample bias\u201d might have occurred. Therefore, the participation of students \nwill be followed during their \u201cregular\u201d curriculum by means of a longitudinal \nstudy. Finally, more research is needed on the motivation of participants. In \nfuture summer courses, the subgroups of participants of the summer \ncourses will be enlarged and the didactical scenarios will be implemented at \nother institutes. To enlarge the statistical power of the research, more \nspecified and detailed information about the subgroups will have to be \ngathered.  \n \nReferences \nAbdullah, S. (2003).
