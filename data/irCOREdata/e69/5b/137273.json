This means finding ways to maximize equipment reliability and up-time and \nextend plant and equipment life through cost effective maintenance. This paper surveys \nthe performance of gas turbine plants in Afam Thermal Power Station. The findings show \nthat the impact of lost generation (through non-availability) exceeded within a few years, \nthe initial purchase price of the power plants and associated equipments.  \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nA Availability \nCMMS Computerised maintenance-management system \nGT Gas turbine \nMTBF Mean time between failure \nMTTR Mean time to repair \nNEPA National electric power authority \nPM Preventive maintenance \nR&M Reliability and maintenance \nRCM Reliability centred management \nTAM Total asset management \nTPM Total productive maintenance \nTPQM Total planned quality maintenance \nTQM Total quality management  \n \nRELIABILITY AND OPERATING AVAILABILITY \n \nReliability is the capability of an asset to continue to perform its intended function. It is \nnormally measured as the mean time between failures (MTBF) for each system (Dunn, \n2002).  \n 2 \nReliability-centred maintenance is a process used to ensure that any physical asset \ncontinues to do what it is designed and instructed to do. Reliability engineering is \nconcerned with predicting and avoiding each failure as well as assessing the cost if the \nfailure is allowed to occur.  \n \nStaff must ensure that the equipment is designed and\/or modified to improve \nmaintainability, which ongoing maintenance technical problems are investigated, and that \nappropriate corrective and improvement actions are taken (Dunn, 2002).  \n \nThe schedule compliance is one of the key indicators often used to monitor and control \nmaintenance. It is defined as the number of scheduled work orders completed in a given \ntime period (normally one week), divided by the total number of scheduled work orders \nfor that: it is normally expressed as a percentage, and will always be less than or equal to \n100%. Alternatively, it can be expressed as a percentage of actual capacity utilization to \nthe actual or installed capacity over a period of one year. The scheduled restoration task \nis a maintenance task to restore a component at a specified, pre-determined frequency, \nregardless of the condition of the component at the time of its replacement. An example \nwould be the routine overhaul of turbine after every 170,000 operating hours. The \nfrequency with which a scheduled restoration task should be performed is determined by \nthe useful life of the component.  \n \nThe total productive maintenance, TPM programme, emphasizes the production \noperators\u2019 involvement in equipment redesign, maintenance and continuous process \nimprovement. Value engineering of a new asset is used to systematically ensure that the \nuser\u2019s requirements are met, but not exceeded. It consists primarily of eliminating \nperceived \u201cnon-value-adding\u201d features of new equipment. An emerging trend in the \nstrategy to maintain the reliability of equipment is known as total asset management, \nTAM, which is an integrated approach to asset management incorporating elements such \nas Reliability-Centred Maintenance, RCM, Total Productive Maintenance TPM, Design \nfor maintainability, Design for Reliability, Value engineering, Life-Cycle Costing, \nProbabilistic Risk Assessment and others, to arrive at that optimum Cost-Benefit-Risk \nasset solution to meet any given production requirements (Dunn, 2000). This approach \nmust adopt the total planned quality maintenance, TPQM, which is a management \nphilosophy for integrated maintenance that advocates planning all maintenance (i.e., \npreventive, predictive, corrective, and automatic self-fulfilling), as well as the control of \nquality in maintenance. Maintenance Plan improvement may consist a computerized \nmaintenance-management system CMMS, with all modules active, enabling the company \nto track scheduling, parts supply, planning, preventive maintenance programmes (PM,) \nenvironmental and safety compliance, as well as statistical maintenance control functions \nand performance expectations, product quality, customer service, economy and efficiency \nof operation, control, containment, comfort, protection, and compliance with \nenvironmental regulations, structural integrity and even the physical appearance of the \nasset are also concerned   \n \nFailure data and repair time data can be converted into statistical format using Win Smith \nWeibull software for use in reliability calculations, (Fulton, 2000) Reliability models, \n 3 \nusing actual failure data and repair times enable one to predict a system\u2019 s operational \navailability as well as its reliability, maintainability, and other operating behaviour \n(Barringer, 2000). Some of the failure information arises from simple arithmetic \ncalculations and other data follow the preferred method using Weibull databases \n(Abernethy, 1999). The frequency of failures and their costs are influenced by the \noriginal design and construction of the system, the quality of its installation, how \ncarefully the system was used and how well it was maintained. Monte Carlo simulations \nwill enable one to find how costs will vary with time and the various influential factors \n(Barringer, 1999). The reliability model enables one to predict what\u2019 s affordable and \nidentifies undesirable alternatives. Effectiveness is influenced by the availability, \nreliability, maintainability, and capability of the system to perform. \nOften there are pertinent questions for process reliability: \n      \u2022    What\u2019 s the availability of your process? \n\u2022 What\u2019 s the reliability of your process?  \n\u2022 What causes process failures?  \n\u2022 How predictable is your process? \nReliability analysis of the process data helps answer these questions.  \n \nAmong the causes of utilization losses, (Barringer and Roberts, 2002) are: (1) excessive \nsystem-stress (e.g. of temperature, pressure, flow, chemical concentration);  (2) late \nstarts\/early quits;  (3) lack of concern for long-term optimization;  (4)  too frequent \nchange of process aims; (5) lack of a statistical process control; and (6) use of analogue \nrather than digital control.  \n \nProblems should be identified with time and money so that everyone can understand \nthem-then fix them on a priority basis so that the business is more profitable. The process \nneeds a high availability (i.e. a high% of uptime) free from failures, predictable output \nand removal of hidden problems. \n \nRCM entails asking the following questions:- (1) What are the functions and associated \nperformance standards of the asset in its present operating context? (2) In what ways does \nit fail to fulfil its functions? (3) What causes each functional failure? (4) What happens \nwhen each failure occurs? (5) In what way does each failure matter? (6) What can be \ndone to predict or prevent each failure? (7) What if a suitable proactive procedure cannot \nbe identified?  \n \nElectric Power Projects round the world, except Nigeria, are reliable, low cost kilowatt \nhours, address specific customer requirements, coordinates technology enhancements and \nemergency response, environmental compliance, large-scale modernization projects, and \nrisk management. Failures in electric power stations result in downtime, production \nlosses and economic losses as well. \n \nMaintenance practices in Nigeria still leave much to be desired with respect to \nbreakdowns, unscheduled maintenance, and long downtimes. Maintenance is generally \nregarded in Nigeria as an undesirable cost-generating activity rather than one resulting in \nimproved reliability, greater profitability and higher productivity.   \n 4 \nIn Nigeria, maintenance is still too often neglected and so the resulting associated costs as \na percentage of the total operational cost keep rising. The most notable problem is the \nabsence of an effective and efficient maintenance process. The first step should be to \naudit the existing maintenance system, to identify and measure the weaknesses in the \nexisting system and then a medium-range plan devised to improve he system.  \n \nMAINTENANCE PARAMETERS \n \nAn artefact\u2019 s reliability is the probability that it will perform the function for which it is \ndesigned under specified conditions for a predecided period of time. Reliability relates to \nthe frequencies of outages.  \n \nReliability, R (t) = exp (-t\/MTBF). = exp (-\u03bbt)     (1) \n \nwhere t = period of failure  \n \nMTBF = 1\/\u03bb = total operating time\/number of failures.  \nMTTR = \u03c4 = total outage time\/number of failures = 1\/\u00b5 \nWhen these two factors are known for any given system or component, then the \navailability (A) is expressed as:  \n \nA = \nMTTRMTBF\nMTBF\n+\n = \n1\n1\n+\n= \nDowntimeUptime\nUptime\n\u2212\n     (2) \n \nWhere \u03bb = failure rate i.e. number of failures\/unit time  \n           \u03c4 = duration of outage.  \n           \u00b5 = repair rate =1\/\u03c4.  \n \nMaintainability (Mt) = exp (-t\/MTTR) = exp (-\u00b5 t).      (3) \n \n \n \nAFAM THERMAL POWER STATION  \n \nThis is the first major gas-turbine station built in Nigeria: it is located in the oil\/natural \ngas region of the Niger Delta, because of the large reserves there of these natural \nresources. The station with its auxiliary units were built and installed by Brown Boveri. \nThe first phase, Afam 1 was constructed and commissioned in 1963. It consisted of four-\ngenerating units (GT1 \u2013 GT4) each with installed capacity of 10.3MW. However, the local \neconomic growth experienced in the seventies necessitated four additional generating \nunits, each with an installed capacity of 23.9MW, being commissioned in 1976 and \nknown as Afam II. This was followed by four gas turbines of 27.5 MW each, \nUtilization \n(efficiency) \nActual work hours \nMax. potential hours of operation + delay hours \n= (4) \n 5 \ncommissioned in 1978 and known as Afam III. In 1982, six generating units, with \ninstalled capacity of 75 MW each were added to the station. In 2002, Afam V was \ncommissioned, with two generating units each of installed capacity 138MW.  \n \nThis rapid growth has ensued despite enormous technical problems with the individual \ngenerating units and the auxiliaries. These have caused forced or emergency outages, \nlong or delayed downtime, high cost of power generation and erratic power supplies from \nthe station. Maintenance cost, in the power industries in Nigeria amount to approximately \n25-35 percent of the total production cost i.e. much more than that for fuel. The \nincreasing electricity demand, the increasingly competitive environment and the recent \nderegulation of Nigeria\u2019 s electricity supply sector are resulting in increased competition \namong the independent power producers. To survive, suppliers must reduce maintenance \ncosts prioritize maintenance actions, and raise reliability.  \n \nPLANT CONDITIONS AND MAINTENANCE ATTITUDES IN AFAM POWER \nSTATION.  \n \nFrom a recent survey, there is evidence that the power station performs disappointingly \ncompared with world-class operations. A written maintenance policy and strategy needs \nto be published. A co-ordinator for planning the work orders, to decide the resources \nallocations, training, and maintenance executions needs to be appointed. The preventive \nmaintenance, PM, route, procedures and intervals between maintenance are not well \ndefined. Poor plant history records make it difficult to retrieve the PM history especially \nfor the older plants. A maintenance-culture\/commitment via team-based rewards and \nrecognition should be introduced together with employee empowerment. To date, the \ntotal power available is 430 MW from the Afam Thermal Power Station even though the \nsystem was designed to provide more than 990 MW. \n \nRELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY CALCULATIONS \n \nThe first step should be self-auditing to ascertain strengths, weakness and opportunities. \nThe application of R&M principles in Afam Thermal Power Station plants\/equipments \nrequires that the system\/component availability be defined in terms of Mean-Time-\nBetween-Failures, MTBF and Mean-Time-To-Repair, MTTR. MTBF is the reciprocal of \nthe frequency of failures and MTTR is related to the duration of outages. By definition, \navailability (A) is related to both frequency and duration of outages (equation 1) \n \nThus, the availability goal can be converted into reliability and maintainability \nrequirements in terms of acceptable failure rates and outage hours for each component as \nexplicit design objectives provided these two factors, MTBF and MTTR, are known for \nany given system or component. Then the availability of the system or component can be \nexpressed as shown in equation (1):  \n \n \nAs an example: if \nTotal outage hrs \/ yr =900hrs. \n 6 \nNo. of failures \/ yr =15 \nThen \n \nMTTR  = 60hrs. \nMTBF = 7860 \/ 15 =524 \n A =\nMTTRMTBF\nMTBF\n+\n =0.896 \n Unavailability = 1-A = 1-0.896 =0.104 \n \nAnnual power generation in 2002 = 430 x 8760 mWh  \nTotal Installed capacity = 990.8 x 8760 mWh.     \nCapacity factor = 430\/990.8 =0.44 \nAnnual generation reduction (on 430MW) = 430 x 900  \n        \nIf the cost of power replacement is US$ 0.60\/kWh \n \nThen annual outage cost due to turbine failures = $ 900 x 430 x 0.44 x 1000 x 0.6 \n \nThis cost can be added to the costs of maintenance and installation to obtain an overall \nplant operating costs. \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \n  \nFrom the available records of the Afam Power Station, there appears to be no standards \nor benchmarks, but rather unreliable inconsistent estimates of probable job duration. \nThere is no procedure for reporting performance\/productivity, and maintenance costs, PM \nprogrammes, breakdowns, etc. There are no control data presented through graphs and \ncharts.  \n  \nBetter aims and specific targets are needed for the Afam power station to improve \nmaintenance management systems and productivity. This should be based on a new \nmaintenance paradigm that will improve maintenance control and PM activities. \nPerformance measures are necessary tool for tracking progress, while some may be used \nin benchmarking or assessment (Al-Muhaisen and Santarisi, 2002). \n  \nThe managers must formulate wise strategies, make decisions and monitor progress \nagainst plans by collecting, retrieving and analyzing data.  \n \nReliability models using actual data and repair times give system availability, reliability, \nmaintainability, and other operating system details which allow estimations of costs and \ntrade offs (Barringer 2000).  \n  \nTo reduce downtime and achieve high production capabilities, the aim should be to find \nways to increase equipment reliability and extend the equipment\u2019 s life through cost-\neffective maintenance. To achieve these, NEPA must move away from the traditional \n 7 \nreactive maintenance mode to proactive maintenance and management philosophies. \nThere should be maintenance processes that fully address TQM and TPM operating \nmodes. Such change requires a complete shift to a Total Planned Quality Maintenance \n(TPQM) approach, which is a maintenance and management philosophy that advocates \nplanning all maintenance (i.e. preventive, predictive and corrective), as well as the \ncontrol of quality in maintenance operations.  \n  \nFailure databases derived from world-wide information will be required within plants, \nwithin divisions, and within companies Keeping-local data in Weibull databases should \nprovide details for life-cycle costing by end-users to make better decisions about grades \nof equipment purchased and how failures affect long-term operating costs (Barringer \n1996). Optimizing reliability starts at the front end of the design process and works \nthrough to the life-cycle costing using failure data. Optimizing the cost of unreliability \nstarts after plants are built and effectively reduces problems built into the system by \nconsidering trade off in corrective actions. Hence, reliability optimization process starts \nby collecting age-to failure data and costs associated with the failures, sharing failure data \nwith the supplier partnerships, using the data to solve problems in the plant and to use \nsuch failure data to design more cost effective plants in the future.    \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n1.
