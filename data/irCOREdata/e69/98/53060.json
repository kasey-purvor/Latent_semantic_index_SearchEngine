Introduction \nThe unique characteristics of lasers provides them with the capability for the non-contact processing \nof materials which are otherwise difficult to process, such as clay quarry tiles, ceramic tiles and \nordinary Portland cement (OPC).  \nThe laser processing of concrete is a relatively large field of ongoing research, with many studies \nhaving been carried out to investigate the technique itself and the associated phenomena. Most of the \nresearch, however, has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using \nhigh power CO2 lasers, most prominently with regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning [1-3]. Also, \nas part of nuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [4-7] conducted research to determine the \nworkability of several laser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete \nsurfaces. Such techniques experimented with were: direct glazing of the concrete, single and multiple \nlayer fusion cladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding. In addition, Johnston et al. [8] have \nreported on the successful removal of the surface layer of concrete (scabbling) by means of Nd:YAG \nand CO2 laser radiation. Work by Sugimoto et al. [9] focused upon modifying the surface appearance \nand surface properties of cement based materials using a high power CO2 laser. The laser treatment \nproduced novel surfaces, with surface textures, properties and appearance unique to laser treatment. \nThe resultant physical characteristics and mechanical behaviour of the post-process cement based \nmaterials was later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [10]. Borodina et al. [11] has carried out \ninvestigations into the structural changes within the composition of zirconia concrete caused by \nsurface exposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural changes, phase changes and the \nabsorptivity characteristics. In all of these studies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity \nformation were found to be major problems undermining the performance of the laser treated surface \nlayer. However, Lawrence and Li [12-15] have treated the OPC surface of concrete with both CO2 \nand high power diode lasers (HPDL). The HPDL generated OPC glaze was shown to be more than an \neffective surface modification insofar as it provided superior mechanical, physical and chemical \ncharacteristics over an untreated or CO2 laser treated OPC surface. \nIn contrast to concrete, relatively very little research has been conducted to study the effects and \ndevelop laser-based techniques for the actual processing of commercially available ceramic tiles. Of \nthe work that has been carried out, the most active field by far has been the cutting of ceramic tiles \nwith CO2 lasers. Work by Livingstone et al. [16, 17] studied the effects of laser operating parameters \n and cut profiles on the resultant cut quality. The findings of these investigations were carried further \nby Black et al. [18] in order to develop a laser beam machining (LBM) database for the cutting of \nceramic tiles. The cutting of thick section (>8.5 mm) ceramic tiles with a CO2 laser was studied by \nBlack and Chua [19] to determine the optimum laser operating parameters to effect the highest cut \nquality. Additionally, a two-dimensional model to predict the theoretical temperature distribution \nwithin the thick section tiles during the laser cutting was developed by Chua and Black [20]. \nNotwithstanding these comprehensive investigations, a detailed ceramic tile laser cutting process \nexamination carried out by Solomah [21] concluded that the technique was best suited to the \n\u2018roughing out\u2019 of complicated geometries because, although the process was far quicker and more \nversatile than conventional cutting methods, the resulting porosities would prove to be a significant \nproblem. Much work, however, has been previously carried out to investigate the laser marking of a \nvariety of other ceramic materials. Using both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers, Markov et al. [22] \ninvestigated the feasibility of marking a number of ceramic products used in the electrical and \nelectronics industries. Likewise, Kugler et al. [23] studied the practicability of employing CO2 and \nNd:YAG lasers to mark actual ceramic components used in the electronics industry. The findings of \nboth studies gave a good indication that the laser is a viable option in ceramics marking in terms of \nspeed and accuracy. The predominant area of current laser ceramic processing research, however, is \nin the cutting of various types of ceramic materials. This has led to the development of cutting \nprocessing models for the cutting of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) [24], silicon nitride (Si3N4) [25], \nsilicon carbide (SiC) [26] and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) [27] ceramics with CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers. It \nhas also led to research into the suitability of laser cutting certain ceramics, namely silicon nitride and \ncordierite ceramics, due to their resistance to thermal cracking [27, 28].  \nOwing to the multitude of process parameters involved, the development of an accurate analysis \nprocedure for many laser applications, including the surface treatment of many engineering ceramic \nmaterials, is extremely complicated. Moreover, laser process parameters must be carefully selected in \norder to achieve satisfactory results. As such, the development of a suitable model to predict such \nchanges cannot only eliminate the need to perform experiments with every possible range of \noperating parameters, but can also provide information outside the range of operating parameters \ncurrently possible. For many laser processes a large number of analytic models currently exist for the \nprediction of the thermal behaviour of materials during laser surface processing. These are mainly \nbased on classic analytical solutions to temperature distribution derived by Jeager [29], Rosenthal \n [30], Carslaw and Jeager [31] and Patankar [32]. Using the Fourier integral transform method, Cheng \nand Kar [33] developed a three-dimensional quasi-steady state heat conduction model to study the \ndensification of a laser processed ZrO2 ceramic coating. Thomazin et al. [34] employed finite element \n(FE) techniques to successfully model the laser spot welding of Al2O3. \n2. Thermal events associated with laser surface treatment of ceramic materials \nAn understanding of the physical phenomena which occur during the HPDL surface treatment of the \nselected architectural materials is highly relevant for the modelling of the process. Interaction of the \nHPDL beam with the surface of the selected architectural materials is essentially a thermal process \nwhereby material is removed by means of a phase change; either melting or vaporisation. In the case \nof the HPDL surface treatment of the selected architectural materials, the phase change is comprised \nof melting only. The temperature distribution in a semi-infinite workpiece during laser surface \ntreatment can be described by the heat conduction equation [31] \n Q c\nT\nt\nk T U c Tp p= \u2212 \u2207 \u2022 \u2207 + \u2207 \u2022\u03c1\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03c1( ) ( )  (1) \nwhere Q represents the heat source and heat sink in the workpiece, T denotes the temperature at (x, y, \nz, t) relative to the ambient temperature, To, t is time, \u03c1 is the density of the material, cp is the thermal \ncapacity of the material and k is the thermal conductivity of the material, U represents the fluid flow \nwith respect to the co-ordinate system (x, y, z) fixed to the laser beam. \nThere are basically three types of heat transfer involved in any laser processing operation: radiation; \nconduction and convection. The principal mode of heat transfer examined in the model is conduction. \nThis is mainly for reasons of simplification, but also because in the HPDL surface treatment process, \nconduction appears to be the predominant heat transfer mechanism [35]. An established approach to \nsolving the heat conduction equation (1), given its boundary and initial condition, is by the use of \nGreen\u2019s functions [31]. Green\u2019s function, G (x, y, z, t, x\n\u2019\n, y\n\u2019\n, z\n\u2019\n, t\n\u2019\n, \u03bd, k) represents the temperature at \n(x, y, z) at time t, due to a point source of unit strength at (x\n\u2019\n, y\n\u2019\n, z\n\u2019\n) at time t\n\u2019\n, which is moving with \nvelocity \u03bd. So, by integrating the product of G with the actual absorbed laser power density, A (x, y, \nt), over the dimensions of the laser spot and time, the temperature T (x, y, z, t) induced by the laser \nbeam moving over a surface (z\n\u2019\n=0) is obtained by \n    T x y z t T G x y z t x y t A x y t dx dy dt\nt\n( , , , ) ( , , , , , , , , ) ( , , )= + \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\n\u222b\u222b\u222b0\n0\n0 \u03bd   (2) \nLi et al. [36] has defined Green\u2019s function as a product of a steady state term, W, and a time \ndependent term, U, thus: \n G x y z t x y t W x y z x y U x y z t x y t( , , , , , , , , ) ( , , , , , ) ( , , , , , , , )\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 = \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u20320 \u03bd \u03bd \u03bd  (3) \n3. Theoretical meltpool geometry model \nThe meltpool depth during HPDL surface treatment of the selected architectural materials determines \nthe thickness of the resulting surface layer after solidification (i.e. the glaze thickness). Therefore, it \nis important to know the relationship between the geometry (depth) of the meltpool and the operating \nparameters, such as laser power and traverse speed. A simple analytical model can be obtained by \nassuming that the shape of the solid-liquid interface is parabolic for a circular beam spot and if the \nheat transfer is considered as one-dimensional as shown schematically in Fig. 1. These are reasonable \nassumptions according to R\u00f6mer, who made similar assumptions when considering the laser surface \ntreatment of titanium nitride [37].  \nThe energy balance within the sample shown in Fig. 1 consists of three terms: the absorbed laser \nenergy, QL, the energy transported by heat conduction from the liquid-solid interface of the meltpool \ninto the non-molten material, QC, and the energy required to create a meltpool, QF (assuming \nradiation energy loss is negligible). It is also assumed that the heat transfer under the meltpool may be \nconsidered as one-dimensional. Due to the relative velocity between the laser beam and the \nworkpiece, energy is virtually removed from the interaction zone (convective losses). The energy, QF, \nrequired to create a meltpool is accounted for in the energy balance to compensate for these \nconvective losses. In the case of the HPDL surface treatment of the selected architectural materials, \nonly a small flow of 3 l min\n-1\n of gas is necessary in order to protect the optics, this effectively equates \nto a negligible gas flow. This being the case, the heat balance equation is: \n    Q Q QL C F= +  (4) \nThe laser energy, QL, absorbed by the workpiece, can be approximated by  \n  iLL tAPQ =  (5) \nwhere ti is the interaction time of the laser beam with a given point on the surface of the workpiece. \nThe interaction time at the centre line of the meltpool along the direction of the beam traverse is \n \nv\nd\nt i =  (6) \nwhere d is the diameter of the laser beam and v the traverse speed. The energy, QC, which flows from \nthe meltpool into the solid material can be calculated from the heat enclosed by the heat affected \nvolume under consideration [37].  \n \u222b=\nsV\nsipC dVtzyxTcQ ),,,(\u03c1  (7) \nhere Vs is the volume of the heat affected zone (HAZ) in the solid under the meltpool and T(x,y,z,ti) \ndenotes the corresponding temperature field at time t = ti. It is assumed that the heat transfer under \nthe meltpool may be considered as one-dimensional (e.g. z-axis). Thus the temperature, T(x,y,z,ti), is \nequal to the solution of the problem in which a semi-infinite sample attains a surface temperature \nequal to the melting temperature, Tm, at time t = 0 [39]: \n  T z t T T erfc\nz\nt\nTi m\ni\n( , ) ( )= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 +0 02 \u03b1\n (8) \nThe thickness of the heat-affected volume, Vs, is assumed to be equal to the heat penetration depth \nand \u03b1=k\/\u03c1cp is the thermal diffusivity of the material. The integral (7) can be evaluated if the area, \nSsl, of the solid-liquid interface is known.

The same dependence was derived by R\u00f6mer [37] \nand proved by experimental analysis by Derouet [41] in the case of laser transformation hardening for \nmetals. Since ceramic materials such as those considered in this study are composed of at least two \nelements, often more, their crystal structures are generally more complex than those of metals and \ntherefore the meltpool depth was corrected by a factor (C3). This factor was empirically deduced (C3 \n= 2.29) on the basis of many experimental results obtained for the selected architectural materials. \nThus \n     \ndv\nP\nkTCc\nA2\nC\n1\nz L\nm2p3\nc\n\u03c1\n=   (17) \n \n \n 4. Theoretical meltpool geometry model results and validation \n4.1. Experimentally determined results \n4.1.1. Experimental procedures \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed, Inc.), emitting at 810\u00b120 nm and \noperating in the continuous wave (CW) mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-120 W. The \nHPDL beam was delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical \nfibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-\naxis CNC gantry table. The selected architectural materials were irradiated using the defocused high \norder mode HPDL beam with a beam spot diameter of 1.9 mm and laser powers (measured at the \nworkpiece using a Power Wizard power meter) of 20-100 W. The defocused HPDL beam was fired \nacross the surfaces of the selected architectural materials using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry \ntable at speeds ranging from 60-600 mm min\n-1\n. The laser optics were protected by means of a \ncoaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate of 3 l min\n-1\n.  \nThe selected architectural materials were clay quarry tiles, ceramic tiles and OPC. For the purpose of \nexperimental convenience the as-received OPC blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 \nmm\n3\n) prior to HPDL treatment. The clay quarry and ceramic tiles were UK standard sizes (120 x 120 \nx 5 mm\n3\n). \n4.1.2. Results \nA series of lines were marked onto the surface of the tile samples using output power of 17-51 W at \nrates of 120-480 mm min\n-1\n. These values of laser power were chosen after preliminary experiments \nthat revealed laser powers below 17 W did not effect surface melting, whilst laser powers in excess of \n51 W resulted in vaporization of the surface. Image processing software (Visilog 5) was used to \nmeasure accurately the depth and width of the mark. as indicated in Fig. 2. Table 1 details the melt \ndepths observed in the selected architectural materials after HPDL surface treatment, zm, along with \nthe melt depths calculated using Equation (17), zc.  \n4.2. Comparison of the measured and calculated melt depths \nA comparison of the measured and calculated meltpool depths for the HPDL surface treatment of the \nselected architectural materials is presented in Fig. 3, which shows the melt depths as a function of \n the HPDL line energy, dvP L . It is important to note that the melt depths are given in terms of \nHPDL line energy because the model used is one-dimentioanl in nature and does not, therefore, \nconsider the area of the beam. For clarity and convenience the graph displays only the extreme values \nof the laser power, that is 17 W and 51 W. \n5. Discussion \nFrom Fig. 3 the linear dependence of the melt pool depth with the HPDL line energy is clearly \nevident. The errors between the predicted and measured depth can be seen to increase with increasing \nlaser power and decreasing time. The measured and calculated melt depth values are in closer \nagreement for values of HPDL line energy <15 W mm\n-1 \ns\n-1\/2\n. Beyond this value the measured and the \npredicted melt depths begin to diverge at an increasing rate. The poor correspondence at high values \nof HPDL line energy can be attributed to the shape of the melt pool, which, contrary to the \nassumption of the model of a parabolic shaped meltpool, is in fact not parabolic in shape at operating \nparameters beyond this limit. Consequently, the non-parabolic shape produced by increasing the laser \nline energy causes the model to calculate temperatures. This is mainly due to the fact that the model \nis one-dimensional and therefore intrinsically neglects sideways conduction, assuming all the heat \ntransfer is by conduction downwards (in z-direction). In reality, the heat conduction flows in all \ndirections. So, in instances wherein slow traverse speed and high laser power are employed (e.g. \nHPDL line energy >15 W mm\n-1 \ns\n-1\/2\n), the sideways conduction of energy, which is naturally \nsignificant under these conditions, is neglected, thus the errors between the predicted and measured \nmelt depths are increased. Furthermore, it is believed that at depths which are smaller compared to \nthe spot size (1.9 mm in this case), the heat transfer is approximately in one dimension only [41]. As \nsuch, the melt depths predicted by the model when the laser operating parameters are such that \nrelatively shallow melt depths result, that is when the HPDL line energy is small, will be reasonably \naccurate. Whereas on the hand, when the laser operating parameters are such that relatively deep melt \ndepths result, that is when the HPDL line energy is large, then the assumption of one-dimensional \nheat transfer no longer holds true and the predicted melt depths will be accordingly inaccurate. This \nassertion is borne out somewhat by comparing the measured and calculated melt depths from Table 1 \nand Fig. 3. \n The inhomogeneous nature of the selected architectural materials is also a considerable source of \nerrors in the melt depths predicted by the model. Crystal structures for the minerals comprising the \nmaterials are complicated owing to the large numbers of components. Laser-induced heating changes \nthe optical properties of materials via their temperature dependence. The change in absorbed laser \nlight intensity, in turn, changes the temperature distribution. This feedback is strong enough, to cause \nnew phenomena in the laser-matter interaction (e.g. thermal runaway, oscillation or multistabilities. \nIndeed, B\u00e4uerle [42] has found that in composite materials and multilayer structured materials, the \ncontinuous and discontinuous changes in thermophysical and optical properties of the materials \nsignificantly changes the laser-induced temperature distribution with respect to those estimated for \nplane uniform (homogenous) substrates. As a result of this, the reflectivity and absorptivity of the \nlaser beam by the material, becomes a multiple dimension complex function [42]. \nA matter of great interest is the apparent applicability of the correction factor, C3, for all of the \narchitectural materials selected for this study. It is believed that C3 was appropriate because the \ncompositions of the architectural materials chosen are all similar. In particular, the compounds that \nare primarily responsible for the formation of the surface glazes resulting from HPDL interaction, \nnamely the glass network formers, SiO2 (30-50wt%) and Al2O3 (5-15wt%) and the glass network \nmodifiers Fe2O3 (1-3wt%). \n6. Conclusions \nA one-dimensional analytical model based on Fourier\u2019s law, with quasi-stationary situations in an \nisotropic and inhomogeneous workpiece with a parabolic meltpool geometry being assumed, was \nsuccessfully developed. This model, with the inclusion of an empirically determined correction \nfactor, predicted high power diode laser (HPDL) induced melt depths in clay quarry tiles, ceramic \ntiles and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) that were in close agreement with those obtained \nexperimentally. It was observed, however, that as the incident laser line energy increased (>15 W \nmm\n-1\n s\n-1\/2\n), the calculated and the experimental melt depths began to diverge at an increasing rate. It is \nbelieved that this observed increasing discrepancy is due to the fact the model neglects sideways \nconduction which, although it can be reasonably neglected at low energy densities, becomes \nsignificant at higher energy densities since one-dimensional heat transfer no longer holds true. \n References \n1.
