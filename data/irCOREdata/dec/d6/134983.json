Introduction \n \nThe area of fluid assisted polymer processing covers both single and two phase fluid \/ \npolymer combinations, this work is concerned with the two phase gas and water \nassisted injection moulding processes.    The two phase implementation of fluid \nassisted moulding typically utilises either gas or water as the fluid and there is a \ndistinct boundary between the fluid and the polymer melt; a single bubble is intended \nto form leaving the article hollow.    The advantages of both gas and water assisted \nmoulding are very similar and both can be utilised to manufacture thick sectioned \nitems by gas or water penetration through the melt to \u201ccore-out\u201d the article. Gas \nassisted moulding has been in existence for many years and has been utilised to \nmanufacture items such as suitcase handles, grab handles and core out rib junctions. \nMore recently water assisted moulding has developed to increase the heat transfer \nfrom the moulten polymer to the fluid which has the effect of reducing product cycle \ntime. In addition, the water process has typically seen smoother surface finish of the \nresidual wall inner surface and an overall thinner wall when compared to gas assisted \nprocessing.    The foaming of the inner wall often observed with gas assist is thought \nto be caused by the dissolution of the gas into the melt that later precipitates to form \nlocal  surface  foam.  The  improved surface finish from the water process offers the \npotential to form media ducts with smooth internal bores where the risk of particulate \nbreak off has been minimised and viscous drag reduced. The main advantages of the \nwater and gas assisted moulding processes over the conventional process include the \nability to provide an even and reduced pressure distribution within the mould during \ncooling, which can reduce post moulding warpage for reasons previously outlined; \nimprovements in \u201csink\u201d where the expansion of the pressurised fluid bubble \ncompensates for contraction of the polymer during cooling and therefore maintains \npolymer contact with the cavity walls; material savings can be realised in the \n\u201cshort-shot\u201d process configuration\n1,2. \nA further variation of the gas assisted moulding process is the application of gas \nbetween the mould wall and polymer melt. This configuration usually requires the \nmould to be gas sealed to contain the gas pressure within the mould. The gas is \napplied to the non-aesthetic surface of the product and is particularly beneficial for \nreducing warpage in flat mouldings designed with strengthening ribs to provide a well \nformed \u201cA\u201d surface that is \u201cpushed\u201d against the cavity during cooling\n3. \nThe work presented here focuses upon the two phase water and gas assisted injection \nmoulding processes. The injection moulding machine and the mould tool are fitted \nwith instrumentation, including ultrasound, to monitor the progress of the melt and \nwater \/ gas as it penetrates through the melt in a fixed section of the cavity. The test  3\/35  \nspecimen is a long flow path tube with an initial \u00d820mm and then \u00d810mm section \nthat is \u201ccored out\u201d using the gas or water assist. The test specimen is representative of \nthe thick section tubular components that the gas assist process has been used to \nmanufacture. The applications for water assisted components have been noted in the \nliterature to be automotive media ducts, door handles and thick sectioned components \nof a child\u2019s tricycle\n4. \nA further variation of fluid assisted processing is the single phase homogeneous \nsystem that relies upon the dissolution of a fluid such as CO2 or N2 into the polymer \nmelt followed by significant mixing to provide a homogeneous melt.    The resultant \nmelt typically exhibits a reduction in viscosity compared with no addition of fluid, \nwhich is beneficial for applications that would benefit from lower pressures during \nprocessing. The dissolved fluid has a tendency to precipitate from solution with a \nlowering of local temperature and pressure to form small bubbles within the melt. The \nfoaming from these small bubbles can be problematic for extruded profiles, where \nprofile accuracy is a quality requirement.    However, the foaming action can be useful \nwithin an injection moulded product where completion of mould filling at relatively \nlow pressure is beneficial to reduce post moulding warpage through the reduction of \nfrozen residual stress normally introduced through high injection and \u201cpacking\u201d \npressures. Due to the formation of bubbles at the melt front the surface finish of the \nproduct is typically rough and this process is aimed at structural non-aesthetic \nproducts.    However, the introduction of pre-pressurised moulds\n5 to maintain the gas \nin solution at the melt front during filling has aimed to improve the surface finish \nsignificantly.  \n \n \n2.  Method of mould based ultrasonic diagnostics and sensors \nUltrasonic signatures such as propagation characteristics (velocity and \nattenuation), reflection and transmission coefficients, and scattering signals from \nmaterials, are associated with physical and rheological properties of materials (phase, \nviscosity, microstructure, chemical composition, density, molecular weight, filler \nconcentration, etc.), process dynamics (cycle, injection, packing, holding, cooling, \nmould open, ejection, etc.), material dynamics (melting, flow arrival and advancement, \nfilling completeness, solidification, shrinkage, detachment, etc.), process parameters \n(temperature, pressure, etc.) and product qualities (uniformity, shape, surface flatness, \ndeformation, inclusions, voids, etc.).  Thus, these signatures can be used for \ndiagnostics of polymer processes and product quality\n6-13.  For such purposes, \nultrasonic transducers (UTs) are attached onto the extrusion barrel and\/or mould \n(mould insert) of injection moulding machines.      4\/35  \nFigure 1 shows a cross-sectional schematic view of a conventional injection \nmoulding tool fitted with the UTs and data acquisition system using an ultrasonic \npulse-echo technique. Ultrasonic waves radiated from the UTs propagate through both \nthe mould insert and polymer, reflections at the material interfaces within the \npropagation paths are received by the same UTs. Echoes L\nn   (where n=1,2,3, etc) are \nthe n\nth round trip longitudinal echo reflected at the nearest cavity wall interface. This \ninterface is either steel\/air or steel\/polymer, depending on if polymer has arrived at \nthat location.. Echos Ln (where n=1, 2, 3, etc) are the nth round trip longitudinal echo \nfrom the furthest polymer\/steel interface. Both the time delay and amplitude \nvariations of these echoes are used to measure the ultrasonic velocity and signal \nattenuation through the steel and polymer materials. The steel conditions are relatively \nconstant and the propagation of the ultrasound signal within the polymer is related to \nlocal pressure and temperature which in turn reflects the process conditions. A \nMultiple sensor configuration enables monitoring of the melt flow in the mould cavity \nand polymer status at the chosen locations. The ultrasonic data acquisition system was \ncomposed of two pulser-receivers (Panametrics Inc., Waltham, MA), an 12-bit \ndual-channel digitizing boards (Gage Applied Science Inc., Montreal, QC, Canada) \nwith a sampling rate of 50MHz for each channel and a personal computer with a data \nacquisition and analysis program by LabVIEW. The acquisition rate was 100Hz. \nThe developed high temperature ultrasonic transducer (HTUT) has overcome \nsome of the key practical issues for application to industrial polymer processes at \nelevated temperatures\n14,15. Limitation include been the degradation of couplant \nbetween the transducer and the steel surface along with the need for a cooling system \nfor the transducer, that add complexity to the application and could induce thermal \nchanges to the process. Three piezoelectric HTUT sensors were directly integrated \nonto a mould insert of a gas\/water-assisted injection moulding machine (TM1300 \nfrom Battenfeld). The polymer side of the mould insert had a half cylindrical cavity \nwith a radius of 10mm and three UTs (UT-A, B, C) were fabricated at the HTUT side \nwith an interval of 35mm, as shown in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.    Figure 2c \npresents a moulded part with an inset of a cross-section of the part at the UT-A area, \nwhere three black dots indicate the corresponding areas of the UTs. These UTs had a \ncentre frequency of 9 MHz and 6dB bandwidth of 6 MHz. Fig. 3a and 3b presented \nthe performances of UT-A. L\nn (n =1, 2) represents n\nth round trip longitudinal echoes \npropagating in the HTUT sensor insert and reflecting within the mould insert\/air \ninterface. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the first round trip longitudinal wave echo, \nreflected at the substrate\/air interface measured in pulse-echo technique, was above \n30dB at room temperature. In addition, it was confirmed that these sensors could be \noperated up to 200\u00b0C. Such performance is sufficient for monitoring of polymer  5\/35  \nwater\/gas injection molding processes where the mould insert bulk temperature is \nlikely to peak at around 100\u00b0C when processing certain polymeric materials. \nFigure 4 presents a schematic cross-section of the gas and water assisted \nmould with the UTs, showing ultrasonic propagation paths and flows of polymer melt \nand fluid (gas or water) within the cavity during the moulding cycle. LS is the \nlongitudinal echo that is reflected from the interface between the \u201cfrozen layer\u201d of \npolymer near the mould wall and the remaining polymer melt. LG(W) is the \nlongitudinal echo reflected at the liquid\/gas (water) interfaces. In Figure 4, ultrasound \npartially transmits to water during water-assisted injection moulding, resulting in less \nreflected ultrasonic energy when compared with gas-assisted moulding; this will be \nfurther discussed later. \nA cavity sensor with combined pressure and temperature sensing capabilities \n(Kistler type 6190A) was flush mounted to the mould cavity in a location opposite the \nUT-B transducer.    This arrangement allowed for the polymer temperature and \npressure at the mould wall to be measured for comparison with the ultrasonic data; \nfigure 4 shows schematically the positioning of the transducers. \n \n3.  Experimental setup \nThe gas and water assisted injection moulding processes were operated on an \ninjection moulding machine at the University of Bradford, UK.    The injection \nmouding machine, shown in figure 5, was a Battenfeld TM1300 \/ 350 + 210 BM \nfitted with a B4 controller.    This machine has the capability to deliver two different \npolymer melts to the mould (skin and core materials), but in this case only one of the \navailable injection barrels was utilized as only a single material was required.    The \nBarrel A is \u220540mm internal diameter with a maximum specific melt pressure of \n160MPa and maximum melt delivery rate of 132ccm\/s. \nA specially designed mould tool was utilized for preparation of the gas and water \nassisted samples, a photograph of the actual tool mounted on the machine platens is \nshown in figure 6.    The tool is comprised of a main cavity plate that houses inserts \ncontaining the mould cavity form and exchange of the cavity inserts allows for \ndifferent forms and flow lengths to be studied; the cavity form was not changed for \nthe work presented here.    The polymer melt is injected into the cavity at the location \nshown and follows a runner to the bottom of the tool where the fluid injection needle \nis located.    The needle is located at the bottom of the tool, which is a requirement for \nsuccessful extraction of the water using gravity at the end of the moulding cycle.   \nShown in figure 6 is the insert containing the instrumented straight \u220520mm tubular \nregion of the sample. This section is instrumented with pressure, temperature and \nultrasound transducers that coincide in position along the section to provide data from  6\/35  \nthe same locations. The combined pressure and temperature transducer (close up of \n\u22054mm sensor shown in figure 6) is positioned at the same location along the tube \nspecimen and opposite to the ultrasound transducer \u201cB\u201d; ultrasound transducers and \ntheir locations are discussed later. \nThe \u201cshort shot\u201d method was used to manufacture these specimens, where the mould \ncavity is partially filled with polymer (the short shot) prior to the injection of either \ngas or water.    The fluid bubble displaces the polymer melt to the end of the cavity in \norder to complete filling and the final specimen becomes hollow with either a gas or \nwater core, depending upon the process.    Prior to the mould opening the high \npressure gas or water is released from the mould to leave a hollow article. \nThe material used here was high density polyethylene (HDPE) from BP chemicals \n(BP Rigidex HD5050EA), which has good ultrasound propagation properties.   \nSingle melt and mould temperature settings of 250\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C respectively where \nused throughout and these are the mid point settings suggested by the material \nmanufacturer.    The melt injection rate was set to be 60ccm\/s over the entire 135ccm \nmelt delivery phase.    However, since the peak available injection pressure was \nreached during the melt injection phase, the actual injection rate was measured to be \naround 40ccm\/s.    The fluid injection pressures where changed in these experiments \nin order to change the residual wall thickness and therefore bubble front velocity\n16-18 \nif the bubble propagation could be interpreted from the ultrasound data and if changes \nto the residual wall thickness could be monitored. The gas and water injection \npressure settings were 10, 12, 20MPa, and 17.5, 20, 25MPa, respectively.    The fluid \npressure was increased to the set value in a single step, held for 6.0s and then the \nsystem valves where closed for a further 10s before the fluid pressure was released. \n \n4.   Results \nThe experimental results for the gas assisted injection moulding experiments \nare presented, where specimens were moulded with gas injection pressures of 10, 12 \nor 20MPa. Figure 7 shows a typical result of acquired ultrasonic signals from UT-A \nduring one cycle of gas assisted injection moulding using the ultrasonic pulse echo \ntechnique. The L\n1 and L\n2 echoes are clearly marked on the data and correspond to the \n1\nst and 2\nnd round trip echoes between the transducer and cavity surface.    The LS and \nLG echoes are also clear and correspond to the echo from the frozen layer\/polymer \nmelt interface and the polymer melt\/ gas interface respectively. At around a process \ntime of 9.2s the LG echo starts to appear, indicating that the gas bubble front was first \nobserved at the UT-A location at this time. Both the LG and LS echo remains evident \nup to a process time of 27s, at which point the gas pressure is released and the \npolymer may detach from the cavity wall.    Detachment from the cavity wall is  7\/35  \ndriven by the shrinkage of the polymer during cooling and associated phase change. \nThe changing time delay of the LS and LG echoes may be evidence that the polymer \nwas still in the melt phase during this time.    In the process time from 9s to 27s, the \ntime delay of the LG echo varied from 14.5\u00b5s to 13\u00b5s indicating that the solidification, \ntemperature reduction of the part and the wall thickness reduction due to the \nmovement of gas bubble. However, in the same period, the variation of the LS echoes \nonly implied the solidification and temperature reduction of the part. It is noted that \nthe small echoes S\nn (n=1, 2) always appearing at the time delay of 9\u00b5s and 12\u00b5s are \nthe shear-wave signals propagating in the mold insert. \nResults from a typical water assisted moulding cycle are presented in figure 8 \nwhere the water injection pressure is 20MPa.    This figure shows the ultrasonic signal \ndata from UT-A with the familiar L\n1, L\n2 and LS echoes indicated.    The LW echo \nappears around the process time of 10s with the time delay of around 12.5\u00b5s is an \necho reflected from the polymer\/water interface. This Lw echo is difficult to detect as \nthe signal-to-noise ratio is low, certainly when compared with the LG echo (gas assist) \nin figure 7.    The reason for the difference is a much lower ultrasound reflection \ncoefficient at the polymer\/water interface of 0.2 compared with a reflection \ncoefficient of around 1.0 for the polymer\/gas interface.    In effect, these coefficients \nindicated that 20% of ultrasound was reflected at the polymer\/water interface in water \nassisted injection moulding while around 100% (total reflection) of the signal is \nreflected at the polymer\/gas interface\n15. In addition, voids within the wall of water \nmoulded samples where observed that scattered and\/or attenuated the ultrasonic \nsignals propagating within the wall. Due to the weak reflected signal from the bubble \ninterface in water assisted moulding no further comparison work was possible with \nthis body of data. \nIn order to investigate further the correlation between the ultrasonic signals \nobserved and the gas assisted moulding cycle a process time based comparison is \nmade between the amplitude values of the L\n2\n and LG echoes (Figure 7) and the gas \npressure control signal and cavity wall pressure at the UT-B location. Results showing \nthe L\n2 and LG echos with respect to process time are presented in figure 9.    The gas \npressure control signal and cavity wall pressure with respect to process time are \nshown in figure 10. The L\n2 echo was chosen instead of the L\n1 echo since, in principle, \nhigher-order round trip echoes of L\nn can lead to a higher sensitivity to the cavity wall \ninterface condition\n19. In figure 9, at process time of 6.3s, the polymer melt arrived at \nthe cavity area beneath the UT-A, since the amplitude of the L\n2 echo decreased as an \nincreasing proportion of the ultrasonic energy was transmitted into the polymer \nthrough the cavity wall\/polymer interface. Figure 10 shows that around this time the \ncavity pressure started to increase, indicating arrival of the polymer melt at the UT-B  8\/35  \nlocation. Thus average polymer melt speed, Vm, during this melt injection phase can \nbe estimated from the time difference (\u2206tm) between the fall in L\n2 echo amplitude at \nUT-A and the increase of the cavity pressure at the UT-B location by equation 1: \n  Vm = L\/\u2206tm                        (1) \nwhere L=35mm and is the distance between the UT-A and UT-B locations.   \nThe average polymer melt speed is around 175mm\/s, however other process signals \ncontradict this value of melt front velocity, which is discussed later.     \nAt 8.3s (figure 10) the gas injection control signal begins to rise, which should \ncorrespond to the injection of gas at the gas needle. The amplitude of the LG echo \nincreases significantly at 9.2s (figure 9), which indicates that the gas bubble interface \nwith the melt has suddenly appeared at the UT-A location. The LG echo amplitude \nstays high, but the LG signal becomes indeterminate when its transit time coincides \nwith that of the L\n2 echo due to signal superposition between 13.8s and 21.7s of \nprocess time.    The amplitude of the L\n2 and LG echoes have been blanked out during \nthis time interval in figure 9 and this particular phenomenon can be seen more clearly \nin figure 7. \nIn figure 10, from 6.5 to around 8.0s, the steady rise in cavity wall pressure is \ndue to the melt pre-filling phase.    Once melt pre-filling is complete the cavity wall \npressure falls rapidly until gas injection takes place at 8.3s (the associated gas \ninjection control signal rises at this time).    From 8.3s to around 10.5s The cavity \npressure rises during gas bubble penetration and the equalising of pressure across the \nneedle (between the line supply and the gas bubble).    The set gas pressure is \nmaintained for 6.0s and then from a process time of 14.0s to 24s the gas valves are \nclosed during a period termed \u201cvent delay time\u201d.    The cavity pressure during this \nvent delay time gradually falls as both the gas bubble volume increases due to melt \nshrinkage and escape of gas from the system (probably through the needle\/polymer \nseal that forms).    At 27.5s, the amplitudes of both the L\n2\n and LG echoes recovered to \ntheir initial values as the gas pressure was released from the system.    This infers that \nthe polymer has detached from the cavity wall since the condition at the cavity wall \nfor ultrasound is the same as t=0s, i.e. no melt present.    The detachment of the \nspecimen from the mould wall is not unexpected as shrinkage of the polymer during \ncooling is known to take place.    The process time from 6.3s, the amplitude of the L\n2 \necho decreased, to 27.5s, the amplitude of the L\n2\n echo recovered to the initial value, \nwas called ultrasonic contact duration. The contact duration may indicate the period \nduring which the specimen and mould are in contact and helps to evaluate the cooling \nefficiency. This information will be discussed further in section 5-4. \n \n  9\/35  \n5.  Discussion \n5-1 Melt pre-filling \nMelt pre-filling, or short shot, provides a known quantity of polymer melt to \nthe cavity prior to the injection of either gas or water.    Since the movement of the \nmelt injection piston, or screw, has been recorded during this melt injection phase an \nestimate of the melt injection rate can be made.    Assuming incompressibility of the \npolymer melt and no back flow of polymer over the piston during its forward \nmovement, then the rate of piston volumetric displacement is equal to the volumetric \nflow rate within the \u220520mm section of the mould cavity, where the UTA, UTB and \npressure transducers are located.    Figure 11 shows two process signals, which are \nmelt volume in front of the melt injection piston and cavity wall pressure at location \nUTB taken from the Kistler piezoelectric pressure transducer.    The third signal \nplotted on figure 11 is rate of change of melt volume in front of the injection piston, \nwhich is differentiated from the volume signal already plotted.    The rise in cavity \nwall pressure at UTB is noted in figure 11 and corresponds to an increase in melt \npressure at that point.    If the melt was flowing in the usual fountain flow regime this \npressure rise would indicate the arrival of the melt flow front, as shown schematically \nwithin this figure.    The melt volume between the UTA and UTB locations is 11ccm \nand the time taken for the injection piston to deliver this is 0.5s, therefore the average \nvolumetric flow rate is 22ccm\/s.    The corresponding average melt flow front velocity \nbetween UTA and UTB, which are 35mm apart, is therefore 70mm\/s.    It is worth \nnoting at this point that the set volumetric flow rate of the piston was 60ccm\/s, but \ndue to the required injection pressure being above 80% of that available from the \nmachine (160MPa) the actual injection rate was lower. \nExamination of the UTA and UTB signal amplitude data reveals that the \nactual melt front velocity is apparently much higher than that calculated from the \nmovement of the melt injection piston.    Figure 12 shows a fall in the amplitude of \nthe L\n2 echo upon arrival of the polymer melt at each of the UTA and UTB transducer \nsites. The second plot shows the corresponding cavity wall pressure rise at the UTB \nsite.  The  time  difference  between these apparent melt arrival events is around \n0.15sec, which would give a corresponding melt flow rate of 73ccm\/s and melt front \nvelocity of 233mm\/s.    The melt flow rate determined from this data is higher than \neven the machine set point of 60ccm\/s. \nThe photograph of part of the melt pre-filling pattern is shown in figure 13 and \nprovides a clue as to this discrepancy between the theoretical and apparent melt front \nvelocity.    The pre-filled sample shown is part of the full pre-fill in order to show the \napproximate the melt distribution in the region of the UT\u2019s and pressure sensor.    The \nsample has clearly been formed by a coiled tube of molten polymer melt extruded  10\/35  \nfrom the \u22054mm gate into the much larger \u220520mm section.    This phenomenon is \noften termed \u201cjetting\u201d since a jet of polymer melt is project into the cavity rather than \na smooth fountain flow.    The jet of melt is likely to have come into contact with the \nmould wall in the UTA and UTB locations, therefore reducing the echo amplitude as \nultrasound energy passes directly into the localised polymer.    This phenomenon is \nthought to be responsible for the apparently premature arrival of the melt at the UTB \nlocation when compared the known volumetric flow rate into the mould. \n5-2 Gas flow speed \nTracking the flow front speed of the gas bubble over moulding cycles may \npresent an opportunity to detect needle blockages or reductions in gas supply pressure \nto the mould. Figure 14 presents the amplitude variations of the LG echoes, measured \nby UT-A and UT-B, with respect to the process time. The LG echoes began to be \nobserved at 9.2s and 9.7s with the UT-A and UT-B, respectively, when gas arrived at \neach UT location. Therefore, gas flow speed (Vf) could be estimated using the time \ndifferences (\u2206tf) of appearances of the LG echoes at the UT-A and UT-B locations by: \nVf = L\/\u2206tf, where L (=35mm) is the distance between the UT-A and UT-B. The results \nare presented in Figure 15. Gas flow speed increased with gas pressure. The bubble \nspeed is linked to the formation of the RWT, where higher speed (higher pressure) \nresults in a thinner RWT. In addition, these data provide valuable insights into the \nactual processing conditions that can be utilized to validate the results from mould \nfilling simulations. \n \n5-3 Wall thickness \nQuality control to evaluate the wall thickness of the moulded part is crucial for \nfluid assisted injection molding. But currently the measuring method was limited to \noff-line techniques, in which the parts are cut to measure the wall thickness. Thus, \nreal-time ultrasonic thickness measurement of the parts was conducted during fluid \nassisted injection molding process. After moulding, the moulded parts were sectioned \nand a thickness gauge, with the accuracy of  \u00b11\u00b5m, was used to measure wall \nthickness at the locations corresponding to the UT-A and UT-B positions in Figure 2. \nThe measuring results of wall thickness for gas\/water assisted injection molding are \nshown in Figure 16 and 17, respectively. In these two figures, the closed squares (\u25a0) \nand circles (\u25cf) represented the measured wall thickness by a thickness gauge at the \nUT-A and UT-B areas, respectively. The wall thicknesses at the UT-B (\u25cf) were \ngreater than those at the UT-A (\u25a0) close to the gas\/water injection nozzle, except for \npart #9 in Figure 16 and part #2 in Figure 17. This anomaly is thought to be an end \neffect since the UT-A location is close to the tapered transition section where gas flow  11\/35  \nrate is expected to be unsteady or the unsteady water flow when the water pressure \nwas low.    \nThe wall thicknesses were estimated by equation 2 \nm m t V h \u2206 =\n2\n1\n   (2) \nm = G, W \nwhere  m h   is wall thickness estimation in mm,  V   is ultrasonic velocity in \nthe polymer, and  G t \u2206  and  W t \u2206   are the time delay difference between L\n1- LG and L\n1 \n- LW in Figure 7 and 8, respectively. The time delay differences of  G t \u2206  and  W t \u2206  \nwere chosen at the process time of 27.0s in Figure 7 and 11.0s in figure 8, \nrespectively. These timings were just before the LG and LW echoes disappeared. In the \nestimation, the ultrasonic velocities of 1108m\/s and 1297m\/s in the polymer just \nbefore the part detachment were used to calculate the wall thicknesses for gas\/water \nassisted injection molding, respectively. These velocities were obtained using the time \ndelay differences and the measured wall thicknesses at 20MPa.    The estimations of \nwall thickness using the ultrasound data are given in Figures 16 and 17 with open \nsquares (\u25a1) and circles (\u25cb) to denote UT-A and UT-B, respectively. It is noted that, in \nFigure 17, parts #1, 4 and 5 cannot provide estimated wall thicknesses at UT-B, and \npart #5 cannot provide that at UT-A. In Figure 16, the measured and estimated wall \nthicknesses had good agreement within an accuracy of \u00b17% except for the parts #5 at \nthe UT-B and #9 at the UT-A, indicated by the arrows. In Figure 17, the agreement \nwas within an accuracy of \u00b110% except for the parts #2 at the UT-B, indicated by the \narrow. This suggests that water bubble inclusions within the residual wall may have \nprovided an early echo that appeared to be a thinner than actual residual wall.  \n \n5-4 External Diameter distribution   \n \nFluid assisted injection molding incorporated gas or water injection in the mold \nfilling cycle to form the hollow components. Therefore, to keep the hollow structure \nfrom deformation is the basic requirement for part quality. In our experiments, the \ngas\/water was injected into the mold during the filling process with the pressure of 10, \n12, 20MPa, and 17.5, 20, 25MPa, respectively. In order to understand the correlation \nbetween the formed hollow structure and the injected gas\/water pressure, two parts \nwith gas pressure of 10 and 20MPa were sectioned in the UT-B location. Figure 18 \npresents the photograph of these two sectioned parts. It is clearly seen that the part \nwith gas pressure of 10MPa has a serious deformation and more bubbles existing in \nthe inner surface of the hollow structure. But the part with gas pressure of 20MPa \npresents a uniform shape and fewer bubbles.    12\/35  \nHere, the external diameter distribution, a parameter representing the level of \ndeformation for the molded hollow structure, was presented with gas\/water injection \npressure. The external diameter distribution can be calculated by: \n(Dmax-Dmin)*100%\/Dmin, where Dmax and Dmin were the external maximum and \nminimum diameters in each UT location. A caliper, with accuracy of \u00b10.02mm, was \nused to measure the diameter. The measured diameter distributions in UT-A, B and C \nlocation, represented by square (\u25a0), circle (\u25cf) and triangle (\u25b2), respectively, with \nrespect to the gas pressure were presented in Figure 19. The diameter distributions in \nthree UT locations were less than 1% when the gas pressure was 20MPa. However, \nthose were from 4.6% to 9.9%, with respect to UT-A to UT-C location, respectively, \nwhen the gas pressure was 12MPa.   \nUltrasonic contact duration may also present the relationship between the \ncooling efficiency and external diameter distribution. Figure 20 and 21 present the \nultrasonic contact duration with respect to different liquid (gas or water) pressure in \ngas\/water assisted injection moulding process. Ultrasonic contact duration increases \nwith liquid pressure (gas or water), except part 31 (10MPa) and part 41 (20MPa) \nindicated by arrows in figure 20. When the liquid (gas or water) pressure was less \nthan 20MPa, the contact duration was not stable and lower. The contact durations of \nWAIM are less than GAIM., indicating the cooling efficiency of water is higher than \ngas. These results showed that insufficient gas pressure would cause insufficient \ncooling for moulded part, part deform during cooling and\/or part detachment, and the \ndeformed level would increase with the distance from the gas\/water nozzle. In \naddition, these data provide valuable insights into the actual processing conditions \nthat can be utilized to validate the results from mould filling simulations. \n \n6.  Conclusions \nA non-invasive ultrasound sensor system has been applied to the mould for both gas \nand water assisted injection moulding.    The system has successfully detected both \nthe arrival of polymer melt and the arrival of either the gas or water bubble that \npenetrates through the moulten polymer.    A cavity mounted pressure transducer \nvalidated the introduction of gas or water into the cavity and changes in the ultrasound \nenergy transmission into the melt along with echoes from the fluid polymer boundary \nwere observed.    The strength of reflected ultrasound energy from the fluid polymer \ninterface is highest for the gas assisted case where the echo can clearly be detected.   \nHowever, although the strength of reflection from the polymer water boundary is \ndetectable it is weak and difficult for the automated signal processing system to pick \nout.  13\/35  \nThe utilisation of two ultrasound sensors allowed for the progression of the gas \nbubble through the polymer melt to be detected as the bubble arrival at each sensor \nlocation could be detected.    The bubble arrival at each sensor also allowed for an \nestimation of the gas bubble velocity to be made at various gas injection pressure \nsettings. As the gas pressure setting increased an expected increase in gas bubble tip \nvelocity between sensor locations was observed. \nThe ultrasound energy reflected from the cavity boundary increases as the polymer \ndetaches from the cavity wall since the acoustic coupling is impaired. This \nphenomenon allows for estimation for the length of time that the polymer remains in \ncontact with the cavity wall.    The cavity wall contact time was observed to be longer \nand more consistent with the higher fluid pressure settings.    A higher post moulding \ndeformation of the samples was observable where lower fluid pressure settings had \nbeen utilised. \nThe ultrasound data was used to estimate the residual wall thickness whilst the sample \nwas in the mould.    A reasonable correlation was made between the ultrasound \nestimate and the measured thickness using a Vernier thickness gauge after sectioning \nthe sample components.    Some scatter of the ultrasound thickness data was observed \nfrom the water assisted samples due to the inclusion of water voids within the residual \nwall. \n \nAcknowledgements \nEPSRC, Battenfeld UK and GmbH, A.
