The scaling of metabolic rates to body size is widely considered to be of great\nbiological and ecological importance, and much attention has been devoted to determining its\ntheoretical and empirical value. Most debate centers on whether the underlying power law\ndescribing metabolic rates is 2\/3 (as predicted by scaling of surface area\/volume relationships)\nor 3\/4 (\u2018\u2018Kleiber\u2019s law\u2019\u2019). Although recent evidence suggests that empirically derived exponents\nvary among clades with radically different metabolic strategies, such as ectotherms and\nendotherms, models, such as the metabolic theory of ecology, depend on the assumption that\nthere is at least a predominant, if not universal, metabolic scaling exponent. Most analyses\nclaimed to support the predictions of general models, however, failed to control for phylogeny.\nWe used phylogenetic generalized least-squares models to estimate allometric slopes for both\nbasal metabolic rate (BMR) and field metabolic rate (FMR) in mammals. Metabolic rate\nscaling conformed to no single theoretical prediction, but varied significantly among\nphylogenetic lineages. In some lineages we found a 3\/4 exponent, in others a 2\/3 exponent,\nand in yet others exponents differed significantly from both theoretical values. Analysis of the\nphylogenetic signal in the data indicated that the assumptions of neither species-level analysis\nnor independent contrasts were met. Analyses that assumed no phylogenetic signal in the data\n(species-level analysis) or a strong phylogenetic signal (independent contrasts), therefore,\nreturned estimates of allometric slopes that were erroneous in 30% and 50% of cases,\nrespectively. Hence, quantitative estimation of the phylogenetic signal is essential for\ndetermining scaling exponents. The lack of evidence for a predominant scaling exponent in\nthese analyses suggests that general models of metabolic scaling, and macro-ecological\ntheories that depend on them, have little explanatory power.\nKey words: allometry; basal metabolic rate (BMR); field metabolic rate (FMR); Kleiber\u2019s law;\nmetabolic theory of ecology (MTE); phylogenetic comparative analysis; phylogenetic generalized least\nsquares; phylogenetically independent contrasts; phylogeny; power law; scaling.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe empirical values of scaling exponents relating\nphysiological variables to body size are held to reflect\nimportant general constraints (Schmidt-Nielsen 1984,\nPeters 1986, O\u2019Connor et al. 2007; see also Dodds et al.\n[2001] and Glazier [2005] for reviews on the scaling of\nmetabolic rates). The scaling of energy needs has\ngenerated particular interest, as it potentially has major\nimplications for organisms\u2019 population densities, ecolo-\ngy and behavior (Peters 1986, Lovegrove 2000, Dodds et\nal. 2001, Anderson and Jetz 2005, McNab 2005a, b,\n2006, Duncan et al. 2007, White et al. 2007b, Dial et al.\n2008). An early theoretical model proposes that\nmetabolic rate of organisms maintaining a constant\nbody temperature is proportional to the rate of heat loss\nthrough their body surface area. Because surface area\nscales to the two-thirds power of volume and mass, the\nmodel predicts that the allometric exponent of metabolic\nrate on body mass is two-thirds, or 0.66 (reviewed in\nSchmidt-Nielsen [1984] and Dodds et al. [2001]; see also\nReynolds 1997). A seminal paper by Kleiber, however,\nconcluded that mammalian basal metabolic rate (BMR)\nscales on body mass with a 0.75 exponent (\u2018\u2018Kleiber\u2019s\nlaw,\u2019\u2019 reviewed by Schmidt-Nielsen [1984] and Dodds et\nal. [2001]). Ever since, theoretical models have been\nproposed to explain the 3\/4 scaling of metabolism, such\nas dimensional analysis-based models (reviewed by\nSchmidt-Nielsen [1984] and Dodds et al. [2001]),\nnutrient supply network (West et al. 1997), four-\ndimensional biology (West et al. 1999), and allometric\ncascade models linking physiological processes from cell\nlevel to whole organism level (Darveau et al. 2002).\nBecause early empirical studies suggested that the three-\nquarter scaling of metabolism is found from unicellular\norganisms to mammals, several models rest on the\nassumption of an underlying 3\/4 scaling principle (West\net al. 1997, 1999, Gillooly et al. 2001). Recently, it has\nbeen proposed that the 3\/4 scaling of metabolism can\nalso explain a range of interspecific macroecological and\nlife history patterns (the \u2018\u2018metabolic theory of ecology,\u2019\u2019\nMTE; Brown et al. 2004).\nManuscript received 8 May 2009; revised 2 November 2009;\naccepted 21 December 2009; final version received 12 January\n2010. Corresponding Editor: S. R. Beissinger.\n3 E-mail: Isabella.Capellini@durham.ac.uk\n2783\nWhile these models sparked discussion about the 3\/4\nallometric exponent of metabolism (Dodds et al. 2001,\nBanavar et al. 2002, 2003, Darveau et al. 2002, 2003,\nWest et al. 2002a, b, 2003), recent empirical studies have\nfurther tested the assumptions on which the models rest,\nespecially that the allometric exponent (b) is indeed 0.75.\nSavage and colleagues (2004) found b \u00bc 0.75 in most\ntaxonomic groups (plants, birds, fish), Farrell-Gray and\nGotelli (2005) supported a 3\/4 exponent only for\nendotherms but not for ectotherms, while other authors\nconcluded that the 3\/4 exponent may differ between\nbroad taxonomic groups (from unicellular organisms to\nplants to all vertebrate classes; White et al. 2007a,\nGlazier 2008). Similarly, the allometric slope of field\nmetabolic rate (FMR) is believed to be 0.75 (Nagy et al.\n1999, Anderson and Jetz 2005), but there has been little\/\nno attention to the variability or otherwise of this value.\nThis is surprising because, while BMR is recorded under\nconditions that animals rarely meet in the wild, FMR is\nan estimate of the daily energy expenditure under\nnatural conditions, and therefore a more meaningful\nestimate of metabolism.\nDifferences in conclusions between studies might be\ndetermined by the choice of methods and species\nincluded in the analyses. Here we mention a few\nexamples among the most influential recent papers in\nthe field to illustrate the diversity of approaches used\nand conclusions reached. Because most BMR data come\nfrom small mammals, data sets are sometimes analyzed\nseparately for \u2018\u2018small\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018large\u2019\u2019 mammals, but the\nthreshold used to split the data set is arbitrary. By\ndividing the data sets in multiple subsets Dodds et al.\n(2001) concluded that the allometric exponent of BMR\nvaries across the range of body sizes and that there is a\nthreshold at 10 kg, such that a 2\/3 scaling exponent is\nfound in mammals of mass less than 10 kg (and in\nbirds), while larger mammals have a 3\/4 exponent, thus\nleading to a general \u2018\u2018mammalian\u2019\u2019 slope between the\ntwo predicted values. Savage et al. (2004) instead\npartitioned the data in size-classes (\u2018\u2018bins\u2019\u2019), averaged\nvalues of all species within each class and used these\nmeans in their analysis of scaling exponents. This\napproach however reduces sample sizes and thus\nstatistical power and, like the previous example, also\nignores the influence of phylogeny. Finally, White and\nSeymour (2003, 2005) normalized BMR to the mean\nbody temperature across species prior to the analysis,\narguing that \u2018\u2018body mass and body temperature are the\nprimary determinants of metabolic rate\u2019\u2019 (White and\nSeymour 2003:4046, White and Seymour 2005:1615).\nHence, it is currently unclear whether variability in\nscaling exponents reflects methodology or biological\nreality.\nA crucial consideration in comparative analyses is the\nneed to control for nonindependence in the data due to\nphylogeny (Felsenstein 1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991,\nNunn and Barton 2001, Garland et al. 2005). Although\nsimulations have shown that ignoring the \u2018\u2018phylogenetic\nsignal\u2019\u2019 (Blomberg and Garland 2002) in the data leads\nto erroneous conclusions (Martins and Garland 1991), a\nlarge number of empirical studies on the allometry of\nmetabolic rates ignored phylogeny and were conducted\nat the species level (Heusner 1991, Dodds et al. 2001,\nGillooly et al. 2001, Savage et al. 2004) or only partially\ncontrolled for similarity between species due to their\ncommon ancestry (White and Seymour 2003, McNab\n2008). White and Seymour (2003), for example, assessed\nthe association between traits across orders, which, like\nspecies, are not statistically and phylogenetically inde-\npendent units (Harvey and Pagel 1991); their approach\nalso reduced greatly sample sizes (n \u00bc 17). One recent\nphylogenetic comparative study of BMR concluded that\n\u2018\u2018the 95% confidence intervals included, or almost\nincluded, the scaling exponent predicted by MTE\u2019\u2019\n(Duncan et al. 2007), though the predictions of the\nMTE for the scaling of age at first reproduction and\ngrowth rate did not hold (Duncan et al. 2007, Lovegrove\n2009).\nHere we investigated the importance of using phylo-\ngenetic comparative methods when studying the scaling\nof both basal metabolic rate and the ecologically more\nrelevant measure, field metabolic rate in mammals, and\nassessed how the choice of method affects the conclu-\nsions regarding the proposed theoretical exponents. We\nalso tested for differences between clades to assess the\nvariability of the exponent within mammals. For each\nclade and metabolic rate, we first tested whether there is\na phylogenetic signal in metabolic rates and in their\nassociation with body mass (Blomberg and Garland\n2002, Freckleton et al. 2002, Blomberg et al. 2003), and\nderived the slopes under different models that accounted\nfor phylogeny to a different extent. Second, we tested\nwhether models that did not account for phylogeny\n(species-level analysis) fit the data better than models\nthat accounted for phylogeny.\nMETHODS\nData collection\nWe used the BMR database of White and Seymour\n(2003) and White et al. (2006) for mammals. Data were\nused as estimates of BMR (in mL O2\/hour) if\nmeasurements were collected on adult, nonreproducing,\npostabsorptive, resting and inactive but not sleeping\nindividuals, and with external temperature within the\nthermoneutral zone for the species (McNab 1988, 1997).\nData that did not fulfill these criteria were discarded.\nHowever, we excluded from this data set nine primates\nwhose BMR estimates were not measured under the\nconditions explained above (Ross 1992). Overall, the\nBMR data set included 580 mammals.\nWe enlarged the mammalian data set in Nagy et al.\n(1999) on FMR with new data published since 1999.\nData on FMR (kJ\/d) were included in the analysis if\ncollected with the doubly labeled water method on wild\nadult individuals. The final FMR data set included 119\nspecies. All the data were log-transformed prior to\nISABELLA CAPELLINI ET AL.2784 Ecology, Vol. 91, No. 9\nstatistical analysis (data set available in Supplement;\nreferences in Appendix A).\nPhylogenetic signal and estimating allometric exponents\nWe used Bininda-Emonds et al. (2007) super-tree of\nmammals with updated branch lengths (Bininda-\nEmonds et al. 2008) and BayesTraits (Pagel et al.\n2004) for all statistical analyses. Because the use of\nphylogenetically controlled methods has been ques-\ntioned when applied to the study of metabolism (e.g.,\nWestoby et al. 1995, McNab 2005a, b, 2006, 2008), we\nfirst assessed the strength of the phylogenetic signal (k)\nfor BMR and FMR alone and then for their association\nwith body mass, using phylogenetic generalized least-\nsquares models (PGLS; Pagel 1997, 1999, Blomberg and\nGarland 2002, Freckleton et al. 2002, Blomberg et al.\n2003, Lavin et al. 2008) in BayesTraits (Pagel et al.\n2004). A simulation study showed that k correctly\npredicts the strength of phylogenetic signal in the data\n(Freckleton et al. 2002).\nIn PGLS, the phylogeny is transformed into a\nvariance\u2013covariance matrix, such that the path length\nfrom the root to the tips of the tree (the \u2018\u2018variance\u2019\u2019) is\ngiven along the diagonal of the matrix, and the shared\nevolutionary history of any given pair of species,\nrepresented as time of common evolution from the root\nto the last common ancestor (the \u2018\u2018covariance\u2019\u2019), is given\nin the off-diagonal values (Pagel 1999, Freckleton et al.\n2002, Lavin et al. 2008). The k parameter is found by\nmaximum likelihood (ML) in PGLS and potentially\nvaries between 0 (no phylogenetic signal; the species can\nbe treated as independent) and 1 (the observed pattern\nof trait variation among the species is predicted by the\nphylogeny, i.e., the similarity among species scales in\ndirect proportion to their shared evolutionary time;\nPagel 1997, 1999, Freckleton et al. 2002). Mathemati-\ncally k scales the off-diagonal values of the variance\u2013\ncovariance matrix (Pagel 1999, Freckleton et al. 2002).\nWhen k \u00bc 0, the off-diagonal values are equal to 0 and\nthe tree becomes a \u2018\u2018star\u2019\u2019 phylogeny (Pagel 1999, Lavin\net al. 2008). When k \u00bc 1, branch lengths remain\nunaltered; when this model fits the data better we can\nconclude that the phylogeny correctly predicts the\npattern of variation at the tips under a Brownian\nmotion model of evolution (further mathematical details\ncan be found in Pagel 1999, Garland and Ives 2000,\nFreckleton et al. 2002, Lavin et al. 2008).\nWe calculated the allometric regression of both BMR\nand FMR on body mass, while simultaneously estimat-\ning ML k as explained above (Pagel 1997, 1999,\nFreckleton et al. 2002). Regression parameters were\nalso found with ML in PGLS (Pagel 1997, 1999,\nFreckleton et al. 2002). In regression, the variance\u2013\ncovariance matrix with k is incorporated in the error\nterm of the regression equation, so that the error term is\npartitioned into a component representing the phylog-\neny and the remaining error term (Pagel 1997, 1999,\nFreckleton et al. 2002). This allowed us to quantify and\naccount for the strength of the phylogenetic signal in the\nassociation of metabolic rates and body mass, and hence,\nthe phylogenetic signal in the residuals, that is, of relative\nmetabolic rates (Pagel 1997, 1999, Freckleton et al. 2002,\nLavin et al. 2008, Cooper and Purvis 2009). BMR and\nFMR were controlled for allometry with body mass of\nthe laboratory (BMR) and wild (FMR) animals, as\nreported in the data sources. We called PGLSk these\nPGLS regression models in which ML k is estimated.\nRegression analyses in which k was forced to be equal\n0 are therefore equivalent to species-level analysis, i.e.,\nordinary least-square (OLS) regression, while regres-\nsions with k\u00bc1 produce similar results to those obtained\nwith phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC)\n(Pagel 1999, Garland and Ives 2000, Lavin et al.\n2008). When ML k is intermediate between 0 and 1,\ntherefore, both OLS and PIC are not ideal methods,\nbecause they respectively underestimate and overesti-\nmate the influence of phylogeny. Conversely, PGLSk\noffers a more flexible approach by simultaneously\nestimating ML k when testing the association between\nvariables with regression analysis, thus accounting for\nthe precise strength of the phylogenetic signal that the\ndata exhibit. Thus, unlike OLS and PIC, PGLSk does\nnot impose a given value for the phylogenetic signal on\nthe data, but it finds the best-fitting model with the\nappropriate k value that could range from 0 to 1.\nTo identify the best-fitting model, we compared\nalternative models, i.e., models with k \u00bcML (PGLSk),\nk \u00bc 0 (OLS), and k \u00bc 1 (PIC), using likelihood ratio\n(LR) test (where LR\u00bc\u000223 [Lh (better-fitting model)\u0002\nLh (worse-fitting model)] the best-fitting model having\nthe highest log-likelihood score, Lh), which was tested\nfor significance with a v2 distribution with 1 degree of\nfreedom (Pagel 1997, 1999, Freckleton et al. 2002, Lavin\net al. 2008).\nThe analysis was replicated within placentals and\nmarsupials, and within orders with sample sizes larger\nthan 30 (rodents for both BMR and FMR; carnivores,\nbats, and \u2018\u2018true insectivores\u2019\u2019 [order Lypothyphla] for\nBMR only). We then compared allometric slopes within\nand between lineages using t tests. Finally, we checked\nwhether results and conclusions about the value of\nallometric exponents differed when k was fixed as 0 (as\nassumed in OLS) or 1 (as assumed in PIC).\nSome authors (Speakman et al. 1995, McNab 1997,\nWhite and Seymour 2005, Clauss et al. 2008) suggest\nthat BMR cannot be adequately measured in Artiodac-\ntyla, Soricidae, Lagomorpha, and Macropodidae, be-\ncause post-absorptive states might be unachievable in\nherbivores due to the long time needed for microbial\nfermentation of cellulose during digestion, while post-\nabsorptive shrews tend to be hyperactive; therefore,\nestimates of metabolic rate of these species are not\nphysiologically comparable to the \u2018\u2018basal\u2019\u2019 metabolism\nof other species. White and Seymour (2005) concluded\nthat the inclusion of these mammals in the analysis of\nthe alllometry of BMR inflates the slope from 0.66 to\nSeptember 2010 2785METABOLIC SCALING IN MAMMALS\n0.75, and argued that species composition of compara-\ntive data sets and contamination with non-basal\nestimates are the factors behind differences in conclu-\nsions across studies. We therefore repeated the analysis\nwithout Artiodactyla, Soricidae, Lagomorpha, and\nMacropodidae (\u2018\u2018restricted data set\u2019\u2019).\nThe statistical basis of the allometric analyses of\nmetabolic rates has recently been challenged by the\nclaim that the log-log relationship across species is not\nlinear (Packard and Birchard 2008). We examined plots\nof residuals on predicted values to check for possible\nnonlinearity in the data (Quinn and Keough 2002) and\nalso tested whether a PGLSk quadratic model provided\na better fit to the data. Where we found ML k was\nstatistically indistinguishable from 1, we also employed\nphylogenetically independent contrasts (Felsenstein\n1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991, Garland et al. 1992) to\nfurther assess whether the relationship between meta-\nbolic rates and body mass is not linear, since it is\npossible to fit nonlinear models to contrasts. We\ncomputed contrasts in CAIC (Purvis and Rambaut\n1995), using real branch lengths to match the PGLS\nanalysis. Bivariate linear regressions of contrasts in\nmetabolic rate on body mass were forced through the\norigin (Felsenstein 1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991,\nGarland et al. 1992) and residuals of these regressions\nchecked for evidence of nonlinear relationships against\npredicted values (Quinn and Keough 2002).\nRESULTS\nPhylogenetic signal\nWhen tested individually, BMR and FMR showed a\nML k value close to 1 in all lineages (Table 1; Appendix\nB: Tables B1 and B2). Similarly, ML k of body mass\nalone was high for both the BMR and the FMR data set\n(Table 1; Appendix B: Table B1 and B2). These results\nindicate that both absolute metabolic rates and body\nmass taken independently exhibit a strong phylogenetic\nsignal.\nNext we estimated the allometric slopes of metabolic\nrates on body size using PGLSk regression analysis,\nhence simultaneously estimating the ML k value for\ntheir association. Although ML k was high for both\nabsolute metabolic rates and body mass when these were\ntested individually, ML k of their regression on body\nmass was generally lower, indicating that relative\nmetabolic rates have lower phylogenetic signal. Most\nimportantly, the phylogenetic signal of relative meta-\nbolic rates differed between lineages. Specifically, ML k\nvaried between 0.23 (bats) and 1.00 (true insectivores)\nfor relative BMR, and ranged between 0.00 (marsupials)\nand 1.00 (rodents) for relative FMR (Table 2).\nGiven the above results, we tested whether the scaling\nexponent of metabolic rates varied in relation to the\nstrength of the phylogenetic signal (ML k) of the\nassociation between metabolic rates and size. The\nestimate of the slope of metabolic rates was unrelated\nto ML k (Pearson correlation: r\u00bc\u00020.5, df\u00bc 7, P\u00bc 0.20\nfor BMR; r\u00bc 0.8, df\u00bc 3, P . 0.10 for FMR), suggesting\nthat the scaling exponent was not steeper or shallower\ndepending on the strength of the phylogenetic signal of\nrelative metabolic rates.\nAllometric exponents of metabolic rates when k \u00bcML\nPGLSk models showed that the BMR allometric\nexponent varied between clades (Table 2, Fig. 1a).\nSpecifically, the BMR allometric slope for all mammals\nexcluded both predicted values (0.718; 95% CI, 0.697\u2013\n0.738), it differed from both 2\/3 and 3\/4 in placentals\nand rodents, while 0.75 was supported in marsupials,\ncarnivores and bats, and 0.66 in true insectivores (Table\n2; Fig. 1a). As a consequence, comparisons among\nclades revealed that the BMR slope of true insectivores\nwas lower than those of other mammalian lineages\n(Table 3; Fig. 1a). In addition, marsupial and placental\nBMR allometric exponents were not statistically differ-\nent from one another (Table 3).\nFMR allometric exponents also differed between\nlineages (Table 2, Fig. 1b). Overall, the mammalian\nFMR slope was not statistically different from a 2\/3\nexponent. However, our analysis revealed that marsu-\npials had a lower FMR allometric slope than placentals\n(t112\u00bc 3.92, P , 0.001) that excluded both 2\/3 and 3\/4,\nwhile the FMR slope of placentals included 3\/4 (Table 2,\nFig. 1b) and the 95% CI of FMR slope in rodents\nincluded both predicted values (Table 2). Finally, the\nallometric exponents of BMR and FMR did not differ\nTABLE 1.

Models with k \u00bc 1,\nequivalent to PIC, returned discrepant slopes in 5 out\nof 11 cases when compared to PGLSk models (BMR for\nall mammals, placentals and rodents, FMR in all\nmammals and marsupials; Table 5). Overall models\nwith k \u00bc 1 tended to give higher slopes than PGLSk,\nappearing to indicate support for a 0.75 exponent in\nmost clades.\nComparisons between models indicated that PGLSk\nmodels provided a better fit to the data than both OLS\nmodels and PIC, with the exception of few cases in\nwhich ML k was not statistically different from 0 (BMR\nfor marsupials, FMR for marsupials, and FMR for\nplacentals with PGLSk model vs. OLS model; P\u00bc 0.053;\nTable 6) or 1 (BMR for true insectivores, FMR for\nrodents; Table 6). In such cases, therefore, PGLSk\nreturned similar slopes as OLS and PIC.\nBecause PGLSk models better fit the data, conclusions\non the theoretical values of the allometric slopes of\nmetabolic rates should be based on such models rather\nthan on non-phylogenetic OLS or PIC models (equiv-\nalent to models in which k is unrealistically assumed to\nbe either 0 or 1, respectively).\nNonlinearity of the relationship\nbetween metabolic rates and body mass\nPlots of residuals on predicted values in our analysis\nshow a slight tendency to be U shaped (Appendix C:\nFig. C1), but this may be an artefact of phylogenetic\nnonindependence. Although the PGLSk slope itself is\nindependent of phylogeny, the residuals are not, because\nthey are computed as the deviation of species values\nfrom the PGLSk regression (e.g., phylogenetic signal of\nthe PGLSk residuals [relative metabolic rates] in all\nmammals: BMR k \u00bc 0.85; FMR k \u00bc 0.67). To test for\nnonlinearity it is therefore necessary to control for\nphylogenetic effects by using PGLSk to determine the\nrelationship between residuals and predicted values.\nThis shows no significant association between residuals\nand predicted values across all mammals (BMR, t576 \u00bc\n\u00020.002, P \u00bc 0.99; FMR, t116 \u00bc \u00020.003, P \u00bc 0.99). In\naddition, for clades in which ML k\u00bc 1 (true insectivores\n[BMR] and rodents [FMR]; see Table 2), we checked for\nnonlinearity using residual vs. predicted independent\ncontrasts. There was no evidence of a nonlinear\nrelationship in these analyses (Appendix C: Fig. C2).\nFinally, we tested whether a PGLSk model with a\nquadratic term provided a better fit to the data than a\nPGLSk linear model. Although the quadratic term was\nsignificant (for BMR, body mass t575\u00bc 18.2, P , 0.001;\n(body mass)2 t575\u00bc3.4, P\u00bc0.0006; for FMR, body mass\nt115 \u00bc 3.7, P \u00bc 0.0002; (body mass)2 t115 \u00bc 4.6, P ,\n0.0001), the R2 increased by only 0.003 for BMR\n(PGLSk linear R\n2 \u00bc 0.895; PGLSk polynomial R2 \u00bc\n0.898) and 0.022 for FMR (PGLSk linear R\n2 \u00bc 0.895;\nPGLSk polynomial R\n2 \u00bc 0.917).\nDISCUSSION\nWe can draw two major conclusions from our\nanalysis: (1) allometric slopes vary across mammalian\nlineages and metabolic rates and neither 2\/3 nor 3\/4\nTABLE 2.

The analysis was not repeated for\nLypothyphla because the sample size without Soricidae was too small (n\u00bc 13 species).\nSeptember 2010 2787METABOLIC SCALING IN MAMMALS\nexponents are consistently supported; (2) PGLSk mod-\nels, that account for the phylogenetic signal in the data,\nalways fit the data better than OLS models and PIC and\nshould therefore be preferred when studying the\nallometry and evolution of metabolic rates.\nOur PGLSk analysis shows that allometric slopes for\nbasal and field metabolic rates vary significantly between\nlineages, and that, in several cases, neither of the\ncommonly proposed values (0.66 and 0.75) can ade-\nquately explain the data. The mammalian BMR\nallometric slope was significantly different from both\n0.66 and 0.75. Within clades, the 95% CIs for BMR\nexcluded both values in placentals and rodents, sup-\nported 0.75 in carnivores, bats and marsupials, and 0.66\nin true insectivores. As a result, true insectivores had\nshallower BMR slopes than all other lineages. For\nFMR, a 3\/4 exponent was obtained for placentals, but\nthe 95% CIs for marsupials excluded both 2\/3 and 3\/4.\nThe allometric slopes of BMR and FMR did not differ\nfrom one another within each lineage, with the sole\nexception of marsupials that had a significantly lower\nFMR slope (0.60) than a BMR slope (0.72). As a result,\nthe FMR slope was significantly lower in marsupials\nthan in placentals, but there was no difference between\nplacentals and marsupials in the BMR slope.\nOur results are consistent with and support the\nconclusions of a previous PGLSk analysis showing that\nthe mammalian BMR allometric slope excludes both\ntheoretical values (b \u00bc 0.724; 95% CI, 0.706\u20130.742 in\nDuncan et al. 2007) and exhibits variation among\nlineages (Duncan et al. 2007). Relative to this analysis\nour estimates for the mammalian BMR slope is slightly\nlower and far from 3\/4 (b\u00bc0.718; 95% CI, 0.697\u20130.734).\nThis is likely to be the consequence of our choice to\ninclude only BMR estimates that strictly followed the\nprotocol defined by McNab (1988, 1997), while Duncan\net al. (2007) based their analysis on Savage et al. (2004)\ndata set that included estimates of resting metabolic\nrates (hence values that did not fulfill all the criteria for\nBMR, and thus might provide higher metabolic rates\nthan basal estimates). In addition we used a recent\nmammalian phylogeny with branch length in time\nFIG. 1.

In panel (a), fit lines from PGLSk models are also shown for rodents (yellow), bats\n(blue), carnivores (green), and insectivores (red). Fit lines for all mammals are not shown. Confidence intervals of the slopes for the\nPGLSk fit-lines for each lineage are given in Table 2.\nISABELLA CAPELLINI ET AL.2788 Ecology, Vol. 91, No. 9\n(Bininda-Emonds et al. 2008) instead of a composite tree\nwith arbitrary branch length as in Duncan et al.\u2019s (2007)\nstudy.\nOur conclusions are robust and do not change once\nherbivores and shrews are removed from the data set.\nThus, contrary to previous claims (White and Seymour\n2003, 2004, 2005, Clauss et al. 2008), exclusion of these\nspecies does not yield a slope of 0.66. Given that we used\nthe same data set as White and Seymour (2003), the\ndifference in our results is likely to be due to differences\nin the analysis, namely, whether or not BMR data are\nnormalized to a common body temperature (as in White\nand Seymour 2003, 2004, 2005), and\/or whether or not\nthe analyses account for phylogenetic nonindependence\n(as in our analyses). We argue that normalization to a\ncommon body temperature is unnecessary because BMR\nmeasurements are collected under controlled and\nphysiologically equivalent conditions. The protocol for\nmeasuring BMR (McNab 1997) specifies that animals\nare tested in their thermoneutral zone, and thus not\nexpending energy on thermoregulation. Any subsequent\nnormalization procedure will therefore introduce an\nerror in a species\u2019 BMR measurements, even more so\nbecause it is done irrespective of phylogeny. Further-\nmore, normalizing BMR to a common body tempera-\nture assumes that a low BMR is a consequence of low\nTABLE 4.

Continued.\nSeptember 2010 2789METABOLIC SCALING IN MAMMALS\nbody temperature and, as McNab (2006) pointed out,\nthis would erroneously imply that mammals (like\nectotherms) have no control over their body tempera-\nture. On the other hand, the necessity of controlling for\nphylogenetic non-independence is well established (Fel-\nsenstein 1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991, Martins and\nGarland 1991, Freckleton et al. 2002). A more robust\nmethod for controlling for interspecific differences in\nbody temperature when investigating the allometry of\nmetabolic rates is including body temperature as a\npredictor in the model. A recent phylogenetically\ncontrolled study followed this procedure and showed\nthat body temperature explains only 0.1% additional\nvariance in mammalian BMR (Sieg et al. 2009).\nCrucially, this study found that, when body temperature\nis included in the model, the allometric slope of\nmammalian BMR excludes both 2\/3 and 3\/4 and varies\namong lineages, thus reaching very similar conclusions\nto the ones presented here (Sieg et al. 2009).\nOur analysis is independent of biases in size distribu-\ntion in the data set, since we replicated our tests within\norders where size differences are much less pronounced\nthan across all mammals. Furthermore it shows that,\namong small mammals, true insectivores exhibit lower\nBMR allometric slope than rodents and bats. This result\nfurther speaks against analyses based on binning the\ndata across the whole data set irrespective of phylogeny\n(as in Savage et al. [2004]). Indeed, we showed that\nmetabolic rates, when tested individually, exhibit a\nstrong phylogenetic signal in mammals and within each\nlineage. This result is consistent with previous studies\nthat, using the same as well as other methods, found\nstrong phylogenetic signal in metabolic rates, in several\nphysiological traits and in body mass (e.g., Freckleton et\nal. 2002, Blomberg et al. 2003, Lovegrove 2009). This\nindicates that part of the variance in metabolic rates is a\nconsequence of shared evolutionary history between\nextant species.\nThe strength of the phylogenetic signal of the\nassociation of both metabolic rates with body mass,\nthus of relative metabolic rates, as estimated by the ML\nk, was significantly different from both 0 and 1. Indeed,\nwe showed that PGLSk models provide a better fit to the\ndata than OLS and PIC models, and that assuming an a\npriori value of k \u00bc 1 (PIC) or k \u00bc 0 (OLS) leads to\nerroneous conclusions. OLS models yielded approxi-\nmately 30% error rate in the estimate of the slope and\nPIC had an error rate of approximately 50%. While\nPGLSk models show clearly variation in allometric\nslopes, PIC would erroneously support a 0.75 exponent\nfor almost all clades. Therefore both OLS models\n(species-level analysis) and methods like PIC are\ninappropriate statistical tools because they either un-\nderestimate (OLS) or overestimate (PIC) the influence of\nshared ancestry (Freckleton et al. 2002). We suggest that\nTABLE 6.

Intraspecific variation might lead to lower\nestimates of the phylogenetic signal and a recent method\nshowed that, after accounting for intraspecific variation,\nestimates of the phylogenetic signal increase (Ives et al.\n2007). Plasticity is a source of intraspecific trait\nvariation and metabolic rates are plastic (e.g., Veloso\nand Bozinovic 1993, Corp et al. 1997, Nespolo et al.\n2001, Speakman et al. 2003, Bozinovic et al. 2007,\nRussell and Chappell 2007). Thus, we suggest that the\npattern of variation in the strength of the phylogenetic\nsignal that we have found might indicate that relative\nmetabolic rates are more plastic than absolute metabolic\nrates, with relative FMR being more plastic than relative\nBMR, particularly in marsupials.\nSuggestions that nonlinear models would better fit the\nrelationship between log-transformed metabolic rates\nand body mass (e.g., Packard and Birchard 2008) based\non species-level tests, are likely to be, at least partially, a\nconsequence of ignoring phylogenetic non-independence\nbetween species due to their common evolutionary\nhistory. We found little evidence that a polynomial\nmodel would better fit the data given that residuals show\nlittle curvilinearity and, most importantly, the inclusion\nof the quadratic term only marginally increased the\namount of variance explained. Freckleton (2009) strong-\nly argued against too much faith in small increases in R2\nbetween models for drawing conclusions on the impor-\ntance of independent variables. We suggest then that\nmost of deviation from linearity is due to similarity\nbetween species due to common ancestry; residuals in\nfact show significant phylogenetic clustering. Consistent\nwith this explanation, Lovegrove (2000) argued that\nlarge residuals of metabolic rates in small and large\nmammals relative to intermediate-sized mammals are a\nconsequence of ecological factors (e.g., rainfall season-\nality and unpredictability affecting resource distribution\ntemporally and spatially) and coevolutionary arms races\nbetween predators and prey (for example explaining\nlarge BMR residuals of artiodactyls and carnivores).\nOverall, our phylogenetically controlled analyses\nshow that the allometric slopes of metabolic rates in\nmammals are variable and do not consistently support a\nspecific theoretical value, hence extending the proposal\nof larger-scale taxonomic variability, from unicellular\norganisms to vertebrates and among metabolic states\n(Bokma 2004, Glazier 2005, 2008, White et al. 2007a).\nThe metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) assumes a\npredominant 3\/4 scaling of metabolic rates (Brown et al.\n2004). However, we found that this value was excluded\nfor BMR scaling across all mammals, as well as for one\nof two infra-classes, and for two of four orders.\nSimilarly, for FMR the 3\/4 value was excluded for all\nmammals, and for one of two infra-classes. We conclude\nthat 3\/4 scaling is not predominant in mammals,\nquestioning the empirical basis of the MTE. We also\nshowed that, although the strength of the phylogenetic\nsignal of metabolic rates and body mass is high when\ntested individually, the strength of the phylogenetic\nsignal of relative metabolic rates is highly variable\nbetween clades, perhaps reflecting a greater phenotypic\nplasticity in some groups. Variability in the strength of\nthe phylogenetic signal among lineages and metabolic\nrates might lead to erroneous conclusions on the\nestimate of the allometric exponents when methods that\nassume a priori a specific value of the phylogenetic\nsignal are used.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Mark Pagel for helpful suggestions on the PGLS\nanalysis; Nick Isaac, Craig White, and two anonymous\nreviewers for comments on an earlier version of this paper;\nBBSRC and NERC for funding to R.
