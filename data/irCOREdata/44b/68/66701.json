Geoffrey Elton\u2019s model of Tudor politics, which emphasized the importance of political\ninstitutions and which dominated our understanding of Tudor politics for much of the second half of the\ntwentieth century, has been challenged by a number of historians for over twenty years. They have\nre-emphasized the importance of social connections and cultural influences and turned attention away from\nstudying the privy council to studying the court. In doing so, they have gone back to re-examine earlier\napproaches by Sir John Neale and Conyers Read which Elton had challenged. Yet, these new socially\nand culturally derived approaches, recently labelled \u2018New Tudor political history \u2019, remain varied and its\npractitioners sometimes at odds with each other. Focusing on both established seminal works and recent\nresearch, this review considers the different elements of these approaches in relation to Tudor court politics. It\nassesses the methodological problems they raise and identifies what shortcomings still remain. It demonstrates\nthat Tudor politics are increasingly defined as based on social networks rather than institutional bodies,\nmaking issues of access to, and intimacy with, the monarch central. Our understanding has been further\nenhanced by exploration of political culture and its relationship to political action. However, the review\npoints to the need to integrate more fully the political role of women and the relationship between the court\nand the wider political community into our understanding of Tudor politics, as well as place England into\na European context.\nIn his inaugural address as Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge in November\n1989, Patrick Collinson made a veiled critique of revisionism, and specifically the work,\nPolitical history : principles and practice, written by Geoffrey Elton, his predecessor. Elton had\nlocated policy-making and public affairs in the public institutions of the privy council,\nparliament, judicial courts, and the financial departments of the crown, rather than the\ncourt (which he defined as a private institution). These were the areas, he argued, in which\nthe struggle between the royal prerogative and \u2018constitutional forces \u2019 \u2013 as he defined\n\u2018politics \u2019 \u2013 took place. Though, in Political history and his lecture on parliament for the\nRoyal Historical Society, Elton acknowledged that social networks played a role in Tudor\npolitics, his distinction between \u2018public \u2019 and \u2018private \u2019, his narrow definition of court\npolitics as \u2018 the power politics of an e\u00b4lite \u2019, and his dismissal of royal administration (in the\nhousehold) as based on the mere personal vagaries of the monarch precluded him from\nacknowledging that such approaches had any great significance. It was this institutional\napproach and Elton\u2019s exclusive emphasis on sovereign and separate states as the only\n* I would like to thank Tom Freeman for reading a draft of this review and to the anonymous\nreaders for their comments.\nThe Historical Journal, 46, 3 (2003), pp. 703\u2013722 f 2003 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0018246X03003212 Printed in the United Kingdom\n703\npolitical units worthy of study that Collinson challenged. It was essential, he argued in\n1989, \u2018 to explore the social depths of politics \u2019 : politics in and between local communities\n(including villages, guilds, confraternities) and their vertical connections to lordship and\nmonarchy. Moreover, how individuals understood their political roles, the problems facing\ntheir community and how to deal with them (especially quasi-republican ideas) also needed\nto be explored. Together, this would create \u2018an account of political processes which is also\nsocial \u2019.1\nCollinson\u2019s words tapped an existing vein of dissatisfaction with the perceived failure of\nrevisionist history to deal with questions first raised by Conyers Read and Sir John Neale\nin the early twentieth century about the role of ideology and social connections in politics.\nWorks by Simon Adams, George Bernard, C. S. L. Davies, Steve Gunn, Eric Ives, Wallace\nMacCaffrey, David Starkey, and Penry Williams \u2013 many of which predated Collinson\u2019s\nlecture \u2013 demonstrated clearly what Collinson suggested : that politics was less about in-\nstitutions (as defined by revisionists) than the interaction between those institutions, people,\nand ideas.2 These historians have constructed a more socially derived understanding\nof Tudor politics ; that is, one that identifies social networks and clienteles as central to the\nprocess of governance and, as a result, identifies the court as the centre of politics, rather\nthan the privy council as in Elton\u2019s model. Other scholars, like John Guy3 and Steve Ellis,\nhave emphasized the importance of exploring political culture and non-Anglocentric\nperspectives respectively.4 Together, these works form a new approach to Tudor political\nhistory. Moreover, while this approach remains anchored in archival research, it has also\nresponded to issues raised by both post-modern theory and interdisciplinary scholarship.\n1 Patrick Collinson, \u2018De republica Anglorum : or, history with the politics put back\u2019, in Collinson, ed.,\nElizabethan essays (London and Rio Grande, 1994), pp. 1\u201329.\n2 A highly selective list of these scholars\u2019 contributions would include Simon Adams, \u2018Favourites\nand factions at the Elizabethan court \u2019, reprinted, with postscript, in John Guy, ed., The Tudor monarchy\n( London, 1997), pp. 253\u201374; G.

Moreover, not only do some of their individual\napproaches raise important methodological questions, but the emphasis on incorporating\nthe study of literary, visual, and material sources with conventional archival research also\nraises issues about the use of such sources. Focusing on the court, this review considers the\ndifferent approaches historians have adopted and the methodological issues that have\nbeen raised. It then assesses the picture of the Tudor court derived from their works and\nrelates them to scholarship on early modern courts in general.\nI\nBoth during his lifetime and since, the challenge to Elton\u2019s institutional and bureaucratic\nconception of Tudor politics has focused around three main elements : the roles of the\nnobility, the privy chamber, and factionalism. Influenced by studies of continental nobility\nthat questioned Norbert Elias\u2019s influential assumptions of aristocratic decline and \u2018civi-\nlization\u2019, George Bernard has played a leading role in challenging Elton\u2019s emphasis on\nbureaucrats, like Thomas Cromwell. He has demonstrated the continuing power of\nthe nobility : they remained an important dynamic of Tudor government, militarily and\npolitically (at the centre and in the localities), \u2018 the most powerful and most influential\nsegment of society \u2019.6 In his 1973 doctoral thesis and subsequent articles, David Starkey, one\nof Elton\u2019s students, challenged the primacy of the privy council as the central political\nforum, arguing that the privy chamber was the most significant organ of royal authority.\nHe argued that the appointment of Henry VIII\u2019s favourites to positions in the privy\nchamber, beginning with Sir William Compton as Groom of the Stool in 1510, trans-\nformed the privy chamber structurally and politically. Its members assumed a range of\nfinancial, administrative, diplomatic, and military duties and, perhaps most importantly,\nacted as a key point of access to the monarch.7 If the privy chamber was the locus of\n5 Further key works include Stephen Alford, The early Elizabethan polity : William Cecil and the British\nsuccession crisis, 1558\u20131569 (Cambridge, 1998) ; Margaret Aston, The king\u2019s bedpost : reformation and icon-\nography in a Tudor portrait group (Cambridge, 1993) ; Paul Hammer, The polarisation of Elizabethan politics : the\npolitical career of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, 1585\u20131597 (Cambridge, 1999) ; Dale Hoak, ed., Tudor\npolitical culture (Cambridge, 1995) ; Markku Peltonen, Classical humanism and republicanism in English political\nthought, 1500\u20131800 (Cambridge, 1993) ; Quentin Skinner, Reason and rhetoric in the philosophy of Hobbes\n(Cambridge, 1996) ; Maurizio Viroli, From politics to reason of state : the acquisition and transformation of the\nlanguage of politics, 1250\u20131600 (Cambridge, 1992) ; Greg Walker, Plays of persuasion : drama and politics at the\ncourt of Henry VIII (Cambridge, 1991) ; Walker, Persuasive fictions : faction, faith and political culture at the court of\nHenry VIII (Aldershot, 1996).\n6 G.

This interpretation confirmed earlier work by Conyers Read and Sir John Neale\nwho had both independently argued that Elizabethan politics were factional as coun-\ncillors and courtiers were divided over political issues (Read) or competed over patron-\nage (Neale).9\nThe ways in which these three challenges to Elton\u2019s conception of Tudor politics \u2013 the\nroles of the nobility, the privy chamber, and factionalism \u2013 have developed, and their\nimpact on shaping an alternative model, have beenmixed.Work by Simon Adams, showing\nhow Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, consciously maintained and constructed a wide-\nranging clientele, suggests that aristocratic clienteles remained significant both in govern-\nance and to the self-perception of members of the nobility, including newly established\ncourtier-nobles. Adams suggested that Leicester\u2019s clientele not only gave him an important\nrole in local politics but may also have been more important in establishing his claims\nto a prominent position at court than his close, personal relationship with Elizabeth.10\nSimilarly, reassessing the career and reputation of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex,\nPaul Hammer has shown that the nobility continued to see themselves as royal advisers\nand military leaders. Essex believed that he should have a leading role in policy-making\nin the 1590s because he was one of the leading peers of the realm. He also conceived his\nactions and martial ambitions within the French aristocratic code of the noblesse d\u2019e\u00b4pe\u00b4e,\nwhich emphasized blood and social hierarchy as prerequisites for royal service and placed\nmartial and natural law above civil and common law.11 However, the political roles of\nthe nobility and gentry remain matters of debate. Ellis, for example, has argued that the\nmilitary power of the older nobility (e.g. the Kildares in Ireland, Lord Dacre in the north)\nand their role in administering border areas was challenged by the crown and that the\ncrown was able to disrupt traditional patterns of local influence by introducing new men\nmodern England\u2019, in I.

They lacked the landed base and extensive networks of clients to exercise\neffective border governance and were not always able to build these up because of the\nlimited availability of land and the existence of established noble clienteles against which\nthey had to compete.15\nIn a debate with David Starkey in this journal in 1988, Elton questioned the significance\nof the military and judicial capacities of the gentlemen of the privy chamber as well as\ntheir importance as channels of communication and means by which to obtain the king\u2019s\nsignature. He also challenged the chamber\u2019s financial importance: it had no income of its\nown and was used primarily for the king\u2019s building expenses and as a war chest. Though\nStarkey responded to these issues effectively, it was apparent that, while he was correct\nto reassert the significance of the royal household and of access and personal intimacy\nin Tudor politics, the pre-eminent political role he gave to the privy chamber needed\nmodification.16 It was clear, for instance, that the documents for which the principal\ngentlemen, Sir Thomas Heneage and Sir Anthony Denny, obtained Henry\u2019s signature\nwere bills and petitions and did not represent major policy decisions.\nIt was also unclear how far the privy chamber model could be used to explain the nature\nof Tudor governance beyond Henry VIII\u2019s reign. In a collection of essays edited by\nStarkey, John Murphy argued that, after an initial eclipse under Protector Somerset\nwho transferred the centre of power to his own household, the privy chamber re-emerged\nas a key focus of political life during the rest of Edward VI\u2019s reign and Mary\u2019s.17 The\ninfluence of Murphy\u2019s arguments have been mixed.

Yet, Elizabeth also insisted the privy\nchamber operated as a \u2018cocoon\u2019 rather than a political cock-pit and refused to allow\npolitical debate into its environs. Under these circumstances, the privy chamber\u2019s signifi-\ncance was primarily in patronage where its female members offered a \u2018 free market econ-\nomy\u2019 of favours.21\nFactional arguments have also been problematic. In an influential article, Simon Adams\ndemonstrated that the near-contemporary sources that Conyers Read and Sir John Neale\nhad used to argue that Elizabethan politics were factional \u2013 William Camden\u2019s Annals\n(Books 1\u20133, 1615 ; Book 4, 1629) and Sir Robert Naunton\u2019s Fragmenta regalia (1641) \u2013 were\ninfused with authorial biases and modelled on Tacitus, who, characterizing the Roman\nemperors as corrupt and their courts as faction-ridden, had became increasingly fashion-\nable from the 1590s amongst writers concerned with issues of kingship, power, and cor-\nruption.22 Analysing the language of factionalism as well as changes to the nature of\naristocratic clientage and royal allegiance, Adams was able to reject convincingly the\nexistence of persistent factionalism in the second half of the century, apart from Edward\nVI\u2019s reign and the closing decade of Elizabeth\u2019s. Factionalism was characteristic of most\nof Edward VI\u2019s reign (1547\u201353) because the Reformation changed the nature of social\nallegiance, created ideologically committed clients, and transformed the court into \u2018a\nbattleground for religiously-based factions \u2019. The struggle between Somerset and North-\numberland was also crucial, though its origins remain clouded in mystery. Factionalism\nrevived in the 1590s partly because, as Elizabeth aged, her grip on politics weakened and\npartly because the second earl of Essex sought to establish himself as the queen\u2019s foremost\ncouncillor and assume the leadership of the interventionist party, who counselled military\nsupport of the Dutch and the French Huguenots.23 Adams\u2019s view of the 1590s has been\n18 Diarmaid MacCulloch, Tudor church militant : Edward VI and the protestant reformation ( London, 1999) ;\nJennifer Loach, Edward VI, ed.

George Bernard, Greg Walker, and Retha Warnicke have led the way in chal-\nlenging Starkey\u2019s, Ives\u2019s, and Elton\u2019s arguments on key episodes \u2013 the fall of Wolsey, Anne\nBoleyn, and Cromwell and the \u2018explusion of the minions\u2019 (1519). In a number of essays,\nnow collected together in Power and politics in Tudor England, and in his introduction to that\nvolume, George Bernard has argued that factional interpretations are not supported by\nthe evidence when it is read critically, especially regarding Henry\u2019s active role in policy-\nmaking and the influence of advisers and courtiers.25 Greg Walker has highlighted the\nimportance of uncovering contemporary usage of language \u2013 in the case of 1519, the\nVenetian ambassador\u2019s misunderstanding of English idiomatic use of \u2018Frenchified\u2019 to\ndenote bad behaviour \u2013 in conjunction with close analysis of timing, personalities, and\ncontext.26 Retha Warnicke has emphasized the need to reconstruct the wider social, cul-\ntural, and mental milieu of individuals. In her controversial The rise and fall of Anne Boleyn,\nshe attributed Boleyn\u2019s fall to her putative delivery of a deformed foetus which engendered\na suspicion in Henry that his wife was either an adulteress or a witch.27 In her new study,\nThe marrying of Anne of Cleves, Warnicke locates the collapse of the Cleves match in Henry\u2019s\n\u2018psychogenic impotency\u2019 : impotency caused by his belief that Anne was already a married\nwoman on account of a pre-contract with Francis of Lorraine. Warnicke identifies\nCromwell\u2019s clumsy handling of Henry\u2019s impotency and his ill-timed attempts to patch the\nmarriage up, when it was clear the king sought an annulment, as the key factors causing\nthe minister\u2019s fall.28\nThe crux of the debate on Henrician factionalism is how the king\u2019s personality and\nauthority is defined: was he easily manipulated by competing factions or did he know his\nown mind, enabling factions little opportunity to shape or direct policy? It is on this issue in\nparticular that Eric Ives and George Bernard differ. Ives acknowledges that \u2018Henry was\nnot the puppet of faction; he remained dominant \u2019 but he characterizes Henry as emotional\nand impulsive. Coupled with the belief that policy initiatives often emerged from courtiers\nand factions around Henry, Ives diminished Henry\u2019s role and suggested the king was\nvulnerable to factional manipulation.29 Conversely, Bernard rejects the factional model\nbecause he believes that Henry held the dominant position in policy-making: he was open\nto influence, rather than manipulation, but only on tactics or timing and not the actual\nsubstance of policy.30 The problem with this debate is that the relationship between the\nking and his elite subjects who formed factions has often been defined in monochromatic\nterms: either Henry is always strong and his subjects always weak, or vice versa. This has\n24 Hammer, Polarisation of Elizabethan politics ; Susan Doran, Monarchy and matrimony: the courtships of\nElizabeth I (London and New York, 1996). 25 Bernard, Power and politics, especially pp. 4, 17\u201319.\n26 Greg Walker, \u2018The \u2018\u2018explusion of the minions\u2019\u2019 of 1519\u2019, Historical Journal, 32 (1989), pp. 1\u201316.\n27 Retha M.

Though this is a detailed and fascinating study, Warnicke\u2019s explanation of the failure of the\nCleves marriage ultimately fails to convince because there is neither solid evidence of Henry\u2019s\n\u2018psychogenic impotency\u2019 nor means to ascertain whether Henry would have used such a potentially\nego-damaging reason to divorce an increasingly diplomatically (and possibly physically) unattractive\nwife, even if he laid the blame on Anne.\n29 Ives, \u2018Henry VIII\u2019, pp. 30\u20133. 30 Bernard, Power and politics, pp. 7\u201317.\nH I S T O R I O G R A P H I C A L R E V I EW S 709\ntended to deny the essential fluidity of politics and policy-making, as well as the importance\nof change in personalities and circumstances.\nThis, perhaps over-simplified, picture of the relationship between Henry and his\ncourtiers was challenged in an important paper presented at the University of Glasgow\nin 1994 by Steve Gunn and subsequently published in the Transactions of the Royal Historical\nSociety. Evaluating a range of different approaches to understanding early Tudor govern-\nment, and assessing the problems sources posed, Gunn argued two things. First, it was\nnecessary to distinguish between the \u2018structures \u2019 or political spheres in which individuals\nacted: small family groups, larger affinities, factions, groups of courtiers and\/or councillors\nworking co-operatively together. This would enable historians to identify more clearly\nwho was working with whom and for what purpose. It would also highlight times when\nloyalties or aims cut across the boundaries of the \u2018 structures \u2019. Second, the issues on which\nsubjects interacted with Henry (patronage, policy-making, etc.) and the ways they did so\nalso needed to be distinguished. This would enable the relationship between the king and\nhis subjects to be reconstructed more sensitively. Together these two approaches might\nbreak the \u2018 trench warfare \u2019 of the study of early Tudor politics by reconciling the polar-\nization of views on Henry\u2019s personality and authority. And it would do so, at least partly,\nby demonstrating that courtiers were able to initiate policy and that Henry could be per-\nsuaded by these courtiers at one time, and at other times, impose his own will on them.31\nThough Gunn\u2019s approach has been called \u2018 fruitless \u2019 and \u2018 inconclusive\u2019 by Bernard, it\nseems to offer a more productive way to explore the relationship between the monarch\nand their courtiers and the nature of Tudor court politics. As Cliff Davies remarked in\nprivate correspondence to Professor Bernard which is cited in the introduction to Power\nand politics, \u2018 in any political situation influence flows in every direction \u2026 nobody makes\ndecisions in a vacuum, multilateralism is inherent in any decision-making process \u2019.32\nBreaking down the different loyalties of courtiers, and the ways they interacted with the\nmonarch, allows us to reconstruct the multilaterism of Tudor politics.\nPartly in specific response to dissatisfaction with factional models and partly in a broader\nreaction against the perceived failure of revisionism to respond effectively to questions\nposed by Read and Neale about the roles of social connections and ideology in politics,\nnew approaches to reconstructing a socially derived model of politics have been explored.33\nThese comprise four key aspects. First, the investigation of the relationships and interaction\nbetween people, ideas (including monarchical power, Ciceronian concepts of citizenship,\nrepublicanism, and confessionalization), and institutions, including the conventions or\nrules that governed them. Second, the importance of classical and Renaissance traditions\nwhich provide the political, cultural, and intellectual context for actions, methods, and\nideas. Third, an exploration of how individuals presented themselves and their actions\nto others. This draws on Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s concept of \u2018 self-fashioning\u2019 : that individuals\nconsciously constructed and presented a persona, for their own ends, which did not\nalways match reality.34 It is important for assessing critically sources which purport\nto reveal straightforwardly the life or mental world of contemporary figures. Fourth,\narchival research of traditional sources \u2013 letters, statutes, financial accounts, legal records,\netc. \u2013 remains central. But literary, visual, and material sources are also explored and\n31 Steven Gunn, \u2018The structures of politics in early Tudor England\u2019, Transactions of the Royal Historical\nSociety, 6th ser., 5 (1995), pp. 59\u201390. 32 Bernard, Power and politics, pp. 6\u20137.\n33 Key works are included in the citations given above in nn. 2\u20135.\n34 Stephen Greenblatt, Renaissance self-fashioning, from More to Shakespeare (Chicago, 1980).\n710 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nattention is paid to contemporary uses and meanings of language. Fifth, it consciously\nacknowledges the importance of exploring geographical areas usually regarded as periph-\neral and insignificant : the north, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.\nFrom the application of this approach, a number of related foci have developed: an\nemphasis on the nature of Tudor political culture, counsel, policy-making, the mental\nworlds of key individuals, and the adoption of \u2018 self-fashioning\u2019. Dale Hoak\u2019s edited volume\nTudor political culture has been an important contribution with essays exploring the roots of\n\u2018 imperial monarchy\u2019, the different \u2018 languages \u2019 of counsel, monarchical, and civic concepts\nof parliamentary representation, the rituals, ceremonies, and languages utilized within\nparliament as well as the social and politico-cultural connections between the centre and\nlocalities.35 It has been underpinned by specialist studies, including Markku Peltonen on\nclassical-republicanism and Maurizio Viroli on \u2018reason of state \u2019.36 Building additionally\non the work of Quentin Skinner (on education and classical rhetoric) and Lisa Jardine\nand Anthony Grafton (on contemporary reading practices), reconstructions of political\nculture are increasingly being mapped on to political events, transforming our under-\nstanding of the nature of Tudor politics.37 Stephen Alford has utilized Skinner\u2019s, Jardine\u2019s,\nand Grafton\u2019s work to reconstruct Sir William Cecil\u2019s education. In conjunction with\nexplorations of Cecil\u2019s strong protestant commitment and his awareness of the strategic\nsignificance of Scotland and Ireland to England\u2019s territorial safety, it enabled him to con-\nstruct a picture of Cecil\u2019s political perceptions and beliefs. He then uses this to explore\nhow Cecil\u2019s perceptions and assumptions informed his responses to the central issues of\nthe early Elizabethan political agenda: Elizabeth\u2019s marriage, the succession, and the threat\nposed by Mary Stewart and catholic conspiracy. Conversely, Thomas Mayer\u2019s magisterial\nReginald Pole : prince and prophet uses Greenblatt\u2019s concept of \u2018 self-fashioning \u2019 (of which Pole\nwas a past master) to make greater sense of Pole and his actions. Exploring how Pole was\npresented by himself and others, this approach enables Mayer to assess more fully the\ninteraction between personality, circumstance, and contingency.38\nI I\nThese new approaches to reconstructing the nature of Tudor politics raise three metho-\ndological issues. How should the relationship between political culture and political deeds\nbe explored most effectively? How should literary, dramatic, visual, and material arts be\nused? How is it best to reconstruct the relationship between politics, cultural forms, and\npatronage of the arts?\nIn a seminal article in 1969, Quentin Skinner challenged the common practice of\ntreating texts autonomously, arguing instead that they must be understood and placed in\ntheir historical context, defined broadly as both the writer\u2019s mental world and the pre-\nvailing conventions governing the treatment of issues with which they dealt.39 \u2018We can\n35 Dale Hoak, ed., Tudor political culture (Cambridge, 1995).\n36 Peltonen, Classical humanism and republicanism ; Viroli, From politics to reason of state.\n37 Skinner, Reason and rhetoric ; Lisa Jardine and Anthony Grafton, \u2018 \u2018\u2018Studied for action\u2019\u2019 : how\nGabriel Harvey read his Livy\u2019, Past and Present, 129 (1990), pp. 30\u201378.\n38 Alford, The early Elizabethan polity ; Thomas Mayer, Reginald Pole : prince and prophet (Cambridge,\n2000).\n39 Quentin Skinner, \u2018Meaning and understanding in the history of ideas \u2019, History and Theory, 8\n(1969), pp. 3\u201353, and reprinted in James Tully, ed., Meaning and context : Quentin Skinner and his critics\nH I S T O R I O G R A P H I C A L R E V I EW S 711\nhardly claim to be concerned with the history of political theory \u2019, he argued, \u2018unless we\nare prepared to write it as real history \u2013 that is, as the record of an actual activity, and in\nparticular as the history of ideologies. \u201940 It was an approach that was mutually advan-\ntageous for historians of politics as well as of ideas. A better understanding of the intel-\nlectual climate would help shape the understanding of politics because ideology and action\nmutually informed each other. Political activity set the agenda by making issues, such\nas monarchical authority or resistance, problematic and matters of debate to which the\ntheorist responded, resulting in an endorsement of or challenge to prevailing conventions.\nSimilarly, political theory, shaped by the linguistic and literary context, showed the range\nand limits of the ideas available to theorists and practical politicians alike.41\nIn The early Elizabethan polity, Alford adopts Skinner\u2019s approach to explore how Cecil\u2019s\npolitical principles and aims were shaped by contemporary political theory. He also\ndemonstrates how Cecil\u2019s proposals to remedy the succession problem in the 1560s\ndrew closely on existing ideas of the \u2018Great Council \u2019, but turned to new ends: choosing\na successor after Elizabeth had died. Anne MacLaren\u2019s Political culture in the reign of\nElizabeth I adopts the older approach42 which treats texts as more autonomous discourses.\nMacLaren reconstructs Elizabethan political culture and contemporaries\u2019 conceptions\nof Elizabeth\u2019s queenship using a small body of canonical printed treatises. She also uses\nwhat she terms \u2018speech acts \u2019 in the parliaments of 1566, 1571, and 1572.43 Usefully con-\ntextualizing the issue of female monarchy in wider issues of imperial monarchy and the\nroyal supremacy, MacLaren argues that Elizabeth and her subjects adopted a \u2018providen-\ntial \u2019 model to legitimate her queenship. Elizabeth was hailed as Deborah, a deliberate\nexception to the convention of male monarchs, appointed by God to restore the true faith\nand enacting his will as manifested in the advice of male counsellors (\u2018godly watchmen\u2019).44\nMacLaren\u2019s approach allows for close analysis of canonical texts and, like work influ-\nenced by Skinner\u2019s model, is sensitive to language. However, it is less effective than Alford\u2019s\nThe early Elizabethan polity in demonstrating tangible links between ideas and actions.\nMacLaren offers no evidence to demonstrate that Elizabeth justified her queenship in\nprovidential terms (pp. 25\u201333) while the analysis of parliamentary \u2018speech acts \u2019 is of limited\neffectiveness because the speeches are divorced from the wider political context in which\nthey took place. Indeed, a new and highly useful, wide-ranging selection of Elizabeth\u2019s own\nspeeches, letters, prayers, and other written works edited by Leah Marcus, Janel Mueller,\nand Mary Beth Rose, Elizabeth I : collected works, would indicate that, while Elizabeth was\nhighly cognisant of the gender issue, she played with it only to reject it.45 There can be\nproblems in adopting Skinner\u2019s approach: the complex relationship between political\ntheory and real events, or between theory and an individual\u2019s beliefs and principles, can be\n(Cambridge and Oxford, 1988), pp. 29\u201367; Quentin Skinner, \u2018Motives, intentions and the interpret-\nation of texts \u2019, in Tully, ed., Meaning and context, pp. 68\u201378, esp. pp. 50\u20133.\n40 Skinner, \u2018Some problems in the analysis of political thought and action\u2019, in Tully, ed., Meaning\nand context, p. 99.\n41 Skinner, \u2018Meaning and understanding\u2019, pp. 56\u20139; Skinner, \u2018Some problems\u2019, pp. 99, 107\u201312.\n42 A.

Equally though, by forcing the historian to focus\non the relationship between theory and practice, it demands evidence be produced to\nexplain the relationship \u2013 something neglected in the other approach, as practised by\nMacLaren.\nA second problem of the new approach to Tudor political history is how best to use\npoetry, prose literature, drama, masques, visual arts, architecture, and clothing as sources.\nThe way historians have used drama and masque provides useful insights. Two separate\ndevelopments have led to greater value being placed on drama and court entertainments as\nimportant for understanding early modern court culture and the role of drama in political\ndebate. Influenced by sociological approaches, Norbert Elias\u2019s highly influential The court\nsociety (written in the 1920s ; published in 1969) asserted that drama, masques, and\nentertainments, previously defined as trivial and insignificant, were in fact central to early\nmodern court societies.46 This message was endorsed more recently by New Historicists,\nparticularly those influenced by the work of Stephen Orgel (though he himself was not\na New Historicist). In his The illusion of power, Orgel argued that that Jacobean masques\nembodied, demonstrated, and upheld the status quo of Stuart power.47 However, though\nhistorians have adopted these ideas, they have explored drama primarily through and as\nprinted texts (where extant) rather than adopt, like literary and drama scholars, a drama-\nturgical approach in which the ways that entertainments were staged, performed, and\nreceived are reconstructed. This approach has a number of problems. First, the printed\ntext could be different from the original performed version as plays could be edited to\nkeep abreast of changing political circumstances. Greg Walker, Norman Jones, and Paul\nWhitfield White have shown, for example, that this was the case for Thomas Norton\u2019s\nand Thomas Sackville\u2019s Gorboduc, first performed at the Inner Temple and at court at\nChristmas 1561\u20132 but not published until 1565 (with an important second edition in 1570).48\nSecond, the printed text does not necessarily reflect how the play was performed. This is\nimportant because the way a play was performed shaped how its message was articulated\nand what issues were emphasized. Third, the printed text fails to address the question of\naudience reaction, central to understanding how drama was used to advise the prince or\ncomment on political issues. Fourth, it is unclear why plays were printed and became\nincreasingly marketable. Indeed, this is a central question in Greg Walker\u2019s The politics\nof performance in early Renaissance drama, though one which the evidence, even sensitively\nhandled, will not allow him to answer fully.\nA more effective approach lies in interdisciplinary scholarship and the exploration of\ndramaturgy. For instance, challenging Orgel\u2019s arguments about Jacobean masques, drama\nand literary scholars have recovered evidence which demonstrates that audiences did not\nact as \u2018model \u2019 audiences, receiving, understanding, and accepting the message of a masque\n46 Norbert Elias, Die ho\u00a8fische Gesellschaft (Darmstadt and Neuwied, 1969) ; idem, The court society, trans.\nEdmund Jephcott (Oxford, 1983).\n47 Stephen Orgel, The illusion of power : political theatre in the English Renaissance (Berkeley, LA, and\nLondon, 1975) ; David Bevington and Peter Holbrook, \u2018Introduction\u2019, in Orgel, ed., The politics of the\nStuart court masque (Cambridge, 1998), pp. 3\u20135.\n48 The 1570 edition of Gorboduc, printed by John Day, differs from the first edition and an eye-\nwitness account of the performance at the Inner Temple.

They did not always recognize the message of the play, or accept it if they did.\nIf the monarch was present, the audience often watched them rather than the play.49 This\nis important because it focuses attention on the way that political messages in drama\nwere received and enables us to evaluate more critically the role of drama in counselling\nand political debate. Problems still remain. Eye-witness accounts of performances are\nscattered and fragmentary, for instance, but a dramaturgical approach allows us to identify\nactual responses to political messages or advice in drama; to pinpoint ways in which kings,\ncourtiers, councillors, and others sought to shape or influence policy and to explore how\nthese individuals negotiated their positions over policy and influence.\nSome of the fruits of dramaturgical approaches are evident in Walker\u2019s The politics of\nperformance in Renaissance drama. Using an eye-witness account of the first performance of\nGorboduc, Walker shows that audience members did understand the play in terms of a\ndebate on Elizabeth\u2019s marriage and succession, and specifically a recommendation of\nDudley\u2019s candidacy. Crucially, he shows how the play was also open to other interpret-\nations, particularly regarding the ambiguous and composite figure of Fergus and references\nto the Grey claim in Act 5.50 This was significant, Walker suggests, because the audience of\nlawyers at the performance in the Inner Temple did not accept that Henry VIII could\nlegitimately alter the succession. Similarly, the performance of Sir David Lindsay\u2019s The Thre\nEstatis at Linlithgow in 1540 shows that James V exploited the performance to introduce\nand demand immediately that his bishops enact ecclesiastical reform, but the play was\nalso used as an opportunity by others to push James towards a more thorough reform\nprogramme: to coincide with the performance a privy councillor, Thomas Bellenden,\nsubmitted to James abstracts of statutes and proclamations on ecclesiastical reform in\nEngland.51\nRecent research on the interaction between the monarch and his\/her subjects through\ndrama and masques is reinforced by work in other fields, including P. E. McCullough\u2019s\nstudy of Elizabethan and Jacobean court preaching.52 McCullough demonstrates that\npreachers perceived themselves as having an admonitory and advisory role. Having\nsignificantly more regular access and exposure than playwrights to Elizabeth and, more\nparticularly, James, the pulpit became \u2018a site of conflict not consensus \u2019 (p. 5). Lancelot\nAndrews used his sermons on Gowrie and Gunpowder Days (times of celebration of\nStuart rule and of affirming one\u2019s loyalty) to castigate the court for its licentiousness and for\ngiving mere \u2018ear-service \u2019 to sermons. Similarly, James VI and I hauled the Scottish Pres-\nbyterians to Hampton Court in 1606 for a fortnight\u2019s tuition, via sermons, on the royal\nsupremacy and jure divino episcopacy. Conversely, sermons could be used to scold the\nmonarch, as exemplified most famously by Edward Dering\u2019s sermon in Elizabeth\u2019s pres-\nence in February 1570 which lambasted the queen for failing to reform ecclesiastical abuses.\nThe use of drama, literature, visual, and material sources also raises broader questions.\nShould we privilege some cultural forms over others? How effectively and how widely\nwere cultural forms able to convey political messages? Sydney Anglo, Theodore Rabb,\nand Malcolm Smuts have played leading roles in answering these questions critically.\nMalcolm Smuts has demonstrated that our privileging of painting as the superior art\n49 Bevington and Holbrook, \u2018Introduction\u2019, pp. 8\u201310; John Astington, English court theatre, 1558\u20131642\n(Cambridge, 1999) ; Andrew Gurr, Play-going in Shakespeare\u2019s London (Cambridge, 1987).\n50 Walker, Politics of performance, ch. 6. 51 Ibid., ch. 4.\n52 Peter E. McCullough, Sermons at court : politics and religion in Elizabethan and Jacobean preaching\n(Cambridge, 1998).\n714 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nform is anachronistic, reflecting modern rather than contemporary tastes and priorities.\nWhile acknowledging that it is a crude indicator, he has convincingly shown that the\nsignificantly higher financial value of (and expenditure on) tapestries, clothes, furnishings,\nand food compared to paintings suggests that these were the key ways in which kings and\ncourtiers demonstrated their wealth, magnificence, and hence power and thus should be\nthe focus of study. In 1613, \u00a31,700 was spent on the lace alone on a dress for Princess\nElizabeth and Lord Doncaster spent \u00a33,000 on a banquet in 1621. Conversely, a Van\nDyck portrait cost \u00a325.53 Similar concerns have been articulated by Sydney Anglo and\nTheodore Rabb who have also questioned our wider assumptions about how visual images\nwere used to convey political messages, including questions of who had access to courtly\nshow, entertainments, pageants, etc., and how widely complex allegorical messages con-\ntained therein were understood.54\nAdopting an interdisciplinary approach, Simon Thurley\u2019s Whitehall Palace : an architectural\nhistory of the royal apartments, 1240\u20131698 demonstrates persuasively how cultural forms\nwere used to convey political messages.55 Thurley reconstructs in detail the building history\nof York Place and the east side of Whitehall. He then uses this to provide some solid\nanswers to questions about the significance of architectural display in the sixteenth century.\nHe is able to show that though rebuilding was stimulated by fashion and practical concerns\n(including major internal renovation of the queen\u2019s lodgings, neglected by the unmarried\nElizabeth, between 1603 and 1615 for Anna of Denmark (1574\u20131619)) extensive work\ndid coincide with major changes to the exercise of kingship. The deliberate failure to\nprovide lodgings for the queen on Henry\u2019s acquisition of the palace on Wolsey\u2019s fall,\nThurley argues, was a visual demonstration of Henry\u2019s repudiation of Catherine of\nAragon. Having established Whitehall as his principal residence, Henry deliberately\nmade the palace visually distinctive, adopting and extending Wolsey\u2019s use of flint work and\nblack and white chequering which was not used widely elsewhere. Construction of the\nKing Street and Holbein Gates \u2013 particularly the latter which was the main point of access\nto the law courts and Westminster Abbey from Charing Cross \u2013 were as much visual\nsymbols and reminders that individuals were entering royal territory as attempts to ration-\nalize the palace grounds. Building work was also a barometer of royal favour as suggested\nby provision of lodgings for the rehabilitated Princess Mary in the ambitious waterfront\nbuildings begun in the 1540s (p. 58) and for Robert Cecil earl of Salisbury in a suite of\nrooms near James VI and I\u2019s (p. 78).\nI I I\nResearch influenced by new socially and culturally derived approaches thus shows that\nTudor politics were centred on the court as much as they were on the privy council,\n53 R.

The work of George\nBernard and Richard Hoyle on the nobility, Simon Adams on clienteles, and Penry\nWilliams on social networks demonstrate that successive monarchs relied more on social\nnetworks, formed by ties of kinship, friendship, and clientage, to govern the realm than\ninstitutional bodies. The political principles and beliefs of monarchs and their subjects have\nbegun to be reconstructed and the ways that Renaissance ideas of magnificence, as well as\nclassical-humanism, confessionalization, and classical-republicanism, shaped individuals\u2019\nactions are being explored. A particular focus has been on the importance of the com-\npeting political creeds of \u2018 imperial monarchy\u2019 and the \u2018mixed polity \u2019. The former em-\nphasized that a monarch\u2019s imperium (command) was ordained by God and that monarchs\ndid not have to act on the advice of their counsellors. The latter defined the polity as\ncomprised of the monarch, council, and parliament acting co-operatively together. The\nmonarch\u2019s prerogative was limited by the advice of the council and parliament had to\nassent to any significant political change, especially changes to religion or the succession.\nYet gaps remain in two areas : the role of women in Tudor politics and the relationship\nbetween the court and the wider political community. What research has been done in\nthese fields and why has it not been incorporated fully into the newer picture of Tudor\npolitics?\nConstance Jordan\u2019s essay \u2018Women\u2019s rule in sixteenth-century British political thought \u2019\nhas been central in increasing historians\u2019 awareness of the extent to which contemporary\nattitudes to gender and female monarchy dominated the debate on royal power fromMary\nI\u2019s accession in 1553. The question of how a female ruler could legitimately and successfully\nrule a patriarchal society that argued women were unfit to rule by Biblical and natural law\ndefined relationships between Mary and Elizabeth and their counsellors.56 Consensus on\nthe precise role of gender remains illusive : MacLaren\u2019s Political culture in the reign of Elizabeth\nI suggests that Elizabeth was forced to define her queenship in providential terms to answer\nwidespread beliefs that her gender disqualified her from claiming the throne through\ninheritance.57 Mary Hill Cole\u2019s The portable queen argues that Elizabeth had to use royal\nprogresses to upset \u2018normal \u2019 methods of governance to retain and assert her authority\nagainst her male counsellors.58 Carole Levin\u2019s \u2018The heart and stomach of a king \u2019 suggests that\nElizabeth\u2019s gender was a problematic issue for many of Elizabeth\u2019s subjects, leading them\nto challenge her legitimacy in a number of ways.59 Conversely, Patrick Collinson, in two\nseminal essays \u2018The monarchical republic of Elizabeth I\u2019 and \u2018The Elizabethan exclusion\ncrisis \u2019, has argued that Elizabeth\u2019s queenship was shaped more by a fundamental disson-\nance over political issues and creeds.60 This view is supported by John Guy\u2019s The reign of\n56 Constance Jordan, \u2018Women\u2019s rule in sixteenth-century British political thought\u2019, Renaissance\nQuarterly, 40 (1987), pp. 421\u201351; Paula L.

These clashes were exacerbated by\nElizabeth and her counsellors holding opposing beliefs on the nature of monarchical\nauthority which could lead to deadlock over whether counsellors\u2019 advice had to be ac-\ncepted and who made policy decisions. Many counsellors believed England was a \u2018mixed\npolity \u2019 and that, therefore, Elizabeth should listen and accept their advice. Believing herself\nto be an \u2018 imperial \u2019 monarch, this was a position that Elizabeth rejected.\nHowever, the role of women other than queens regnant in politics remains neglected\ndespite a growing body of research that shows the importance of aristocratic and gentle-\nwomen was not negligible. In a key article in this journal, Barbara Harris demonstrated\nthat individual aristocratic women took stances on key political issues, including Henry\u2019s\ndivorce from Catherine of Aragon, and played an active and important role in forging and\nstrengthening patron\/client relations. The latter were important because they facilitated\ncommunication between the centre and localities as well as strengthened the regional\npolitical power of the nobility, which was dependent on royal favour.63 Other studies have\nreinforced and extended this picture. Maria Dowling and Thomas Freeman have shown\nthat Anne Boleyn was an important evangelical patroness, including conniving (at the least)\nin the presentation of Simon Fish\u2019s Supplication for the beggars to Henry VIII.64 Ciaran Brady\nhas demonstrated that both leading Gaelic and Anglo-Irish women, like Fionnuala\nMacDonnell, Agnes Campbell, Grace O\u2019Malley, and Eleanor Butler countess of\nDesmond, acted in military, advisory, and diplomatic capacities to hinder or facilitate\nEnglish conquest and governance of Elizabethan Ireland.65 By focusing on the mechanics\nof letter-writing, the styles and models women adopted or rejected, a new collection edited\nby James Daybell, Early modern women\u2019s letter-writing, 1450\u20131700, is able to highlight ways\nin which women realized these roles : manipulating both letter-writing conventions and\nfemale stereotypes to establish or extend local political standing, to maintain contact with\nthe royal court and to defend, maintain, and extend their family\u2019s social and economic\ninterests.66 Importantly, Claire Walker convincingly demonstrates that such activity was\nnot confined to lay aristocrats and gentry : prioresses of English convents on the continent\nwere as adept and persuasive in their correspondence as lay women and as politically\nactive, operating important news networks, campaigning for lay support of English exiles\nand giving financial assistance to Charles II.67\nThis work suggests that, though women did not have the central political role\nassumed by men, they could be active in politics and their actions were often integral to\n61 Guy, \u2018The 1590s\u2019, pp. 1\u201319.

Therefore, their roles\nneed to be incorporated into our understanding of Tudor politics if we are to obtain\na \u2018rounded\u2019 picture of how the Tudors\u2019 dominions were governed and what con-\ntemporaries\u2019 political goals were. The reasons why this has yet to be achieved seem vari-\nous. John Murphy\u2019s positive assessment of the Marian privy chamber has had little impact\nbecause Marian historians have focused primarily on exploring the \u2018mid-Tudor crisis \u2019 : a\nperiod of religious change, famine, rebellions, and war around the middle of the sixteenth\ncentury which allegedly challenged and changed the nature of the Tudors\u2019 rule. It has only\nbeen with Elizabeth Russell\u2019s \u2018Mary Tudor and Mr Jorkins \u2019 (1990), Judith Richards\u2019s\n\u2018Mary Tudor as \u2018\u2018 sole queen\u2019\u2019? \u2019 (1997), and Glyn Redworth\u2019s \u2018 \u2018\u2018Matters impertinent\nto women\u2019\u2019 \u2019 (1997) that the issue of gender has been applied to Mary\u2019s reign.68 But even\nthis has not led to an assessment of the political role of women other than the queen.\nPam Wright\u2019s essay on the political insignificance of the women in the Elizabethan\nprivy chamber seems to have been doubly influential here.69 It rejected the idea that the\nprivy chamber played an important role in Elizabeth\u2019s reign, as Starkey had argued for\nHenry VIII. Though Wright did not deal with Mary\u2019s reign, her arguments seem to\nhave been applied to Mary by default : what applies to Elizabeth, must surely apply to\nMary. Elton\u2019s legacy of the importance of formal institutional bodies remains significant\ntoo. The privy council continues to be regarded as the main, corporate, advisory body\nand extra-conciliar counsel as antipathetical to the \u2018normal \u2019 process of policy-making.\nBoth exclude or minimize the political role of women.70 Recent research that has explored\ncontemporary ideas of counsel and advice-giving has done little to remedy this. Counsel\nwas defined by men, in printed discourses and letters between those involved in govern-\nance, as a male activity. These ideas were reinforced by contemporary debate on female\nmonarchy. It legitimated queenship by arguing that the intellectual, emotional, and\nphysical inabilities of a queen to exercise power wisely would be compensated for by\nthe fact that she would govern by listening to and accepting the advice of her (male)\ncounsellors.71 To these, specific historiographical trends have also been important. As\nCiaran Brady has highlighted, assessment of women\u2019s political activity in Ireland has\nbeen hindered less because of the availability of sources than because, over the past\ncentury, Irish history has been defined in terms of English conquest and colonization. This\nemphasis on war seems to exclude women, though MacDonnell, Campbell, and the\ncountess of Desmond were all directly or indirectly involved in military resistance of\nthe English or of Irish rebels.72\nThere also seem to be broader, conceptual reasons. First, reconstructions of political\nstructures and processes have tended to be either monarch-centred (as in Mary Hill Cole\u2019s\nThe portable queen) or courtier\/councillor-centred (Stephen Alford\u2019s The early Elizabethan polity\nand Anne McLaren\u2019s Political culture in the reign of Elizabeth I ). Consequently, the study of the\n68 Elizabeth Russell, \u2018Mary Tudor and Mr Jorkins\u2019, Historical Research, 63 (1990), pp. 263\u201376; Judith\nRichards, \u2018Mary Tudor as \u2018\u2018 sole queen\u2019\u2019? : the gendering of Tudor monarchy\u2019, Historical Journal,\n40 (1997), pp. 895\u2013924; Redworth, \u2018 \u2018\u2018Matters impertinent to women\u2019\u2019 \u2019.\n69 Wright, \u2018A change in direction\u2019.\n70 See, for example, Michael Barraclough Pulman, The Elizabethan privy council in the fifteen-seventies\n(Berkeley, LA, and London, 1971) ; and Alford, Early Elizabethan polity, esp. pp. 69\u201370, 208.\n71 Guy, \u2018The 1590s\u2019, p. 13; John Knox, The first blast of the trumpet against the monstrous regiment of women\n(Geneva, 1558) ; John Aylmer, An harborowe for faithfull and trewe subjects (Strasbourg, 1559).\n72 Brady, \u2018Political women\u2019, pp. 70\u20135, 78\u201380.\n718 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nrelationship between the monarch and their courtiers\/councillors has tended to focus on\neither the monarch or their courtiers\/councillors rather than on their interaction. Second,\nmuch attention has been focused on counsel and policy-making at the centre. There has\nbeen less attention either on the implementation of policy or on the establishment and\nmaintenance of the social networks argued to have been central to Tudor governance. The\ninterests of the nobility and gentry, other than leading councillors like Cecil, have also been\nrelatively neglected. These are all areas in which, as Harris\u2019s work has shown, women\nplayed important roles.\nNew ways to understand the relationship between the court and the wider political\ncommunity also seem needed. Works like Markuu Peltonen\u2019s Classical humanism and repub-\nlicanism in English political thought, 1500\u20131800 (Cambridge, 1993), individual essays by Norman\nJones, David Harris Sacks and Robert Tittler in Hoak\u2019s Tudor political culture (Cambridge,\n1995), as well as much earlier work, such as Mervyn James\u2019s study of the concept of order,\nhave begun to explore the evolution, penetration, and use in the localities of key ideas, like\nclassical republicanism and parliamentary representation.73 However, the actions of\nindividuals outside the court are still defined as being commissioned or manipulated by\nthe privy council. Michael Graves and Patrick Collinson have argued that, for instance,\ndebates by MPs in parliament on Elizabeth\u2019s marriage, the succession, and the religious\nsettlement were organized by privy councillors who sought to \u2018bounce\u2019 Elizabeth into\naction by applying pressure in parliament, when conciliar advice had failed.74 The pro-\nduction of printed pamphlets, like John Stubbe\u2019s The discoverie of a gaping gulf (1579) which\ndiscussed critically Elizabeth\u2019s proposed marriage to the duke of Anjou, have been\nunderstood in a similar way: commissioned by councillors to apply pressure to Elizabeth.75\nThese views have been reinforced by assumptions that political debate outside the court\nwas restricted because of limited access to news: professional newsletters did not develop\nfully until the early seventeenth century.\nResearch in a number of fields is beginning to question these assumptions. Thomas\nFreeman has demonstrated convincingly that Thomas Norton, whom Graves identified as\nworking in conjunction with the privy council in parliament, acted independently in the\nparliament of 1571 to introduce a new ecclesiastical law code, the Reformatio Legum Ecclesi-\nasticarum, which would have reformed the ecclesiastical courts and discipline on more\npuritan lines.76 Peter Clark has shown that inns and alehouses acted as an important nexus\nfor political news and debate,77 while, in Oral and literate culture in England, 1500\u20131700, Adam\nFox has explored the varied ways in which a wide range of men and women, throughout\n73 Mervyn James, \u2018The concept of order and the Northern Rising, 1569\u2019, in James, Society, politics and\nculture, pp. 270\u2013307.\n74 M.

Carole Levin\u2019s \u2018The heart and stomach of a king \u2019\nsubstantiates these arguments by exploring a number of cases in which ordinary men and\nwomen expressed views on Elizabeth\u2019s marriage, the succession, and female monarchy,\neven if some of her conclusions seem anachronistic and informed more by modern feminist\nconcerns than those of contemporaries.79\nThese works suggest that if our understanding of the relationship between the court and\nthe wider political community is to develop, we need to explore the political awareness of\nindividuals outside the court. We also need to recognize that those individuals may have\nheld political principles and been prepared to act on them, just as those at court did. And\nwe also need to explore the connections between courtiers and those outside the court in a\nmore sensitive way. Privy councillors and courtiers may have sought to \u2018bounce\u2019 the\nmonarch into action in parliament and through print, but equally MPs, writers, and others\nmay have acted independently.80\nI V\nOver the past couple of decades Tudor political history has \u2018returned to court \u2019 and his-\ntorians have refocused their attentions on the significance of the royal household, issues of\naccess and intimacy, social networks, and court culture in an attempt to answer questions\nthat the more institutionally focused revisionism had failed to do. Though social and\ncultural emphases have always been strong, study of the early modern court more gener-\nally has undergone a similar process. Norbert Elias\u2019s The court society (written in the 1920s\nand 1930s but not published until 1969) and The civilising process (1969) have dominated the\nfield as much as Neale, Read, and Elton did Tudor political history at the same time.81\nElias resurrected court studies as a valid field of research from nineteenth-century hostility\nto what was perceived as a paternalistic, authoritarian, despotic, and corrupt institution.\nThe central element of Elias\u2019s model was that monarchs, above the fray of competition\nthemselves, deliberately cultivated a climate of conspicuous consumption and competition\nover status at court to make the nobility financially dependent on the crown, thereby\ntaming (or civilizing) them, reducing the political or military threat that they posed and\nweakening the nobility as a group. It enabled Elias to demonstrate that the early modern\nperiod acted as a transitional period between medieval feudalism and modern centralized\ndemocracy, much as Elton had located the rise of modern, bureaucratic government in the\n1530s.82\n78 Adam Fox, \u2018Rumour, news and popular political opinion in Elizabethan and early Stuart\nEngland\u2019, Historical Journal, 40 (1997), pp. 597\u2013620; Fox, Oral and literate culture in England, 1500\u20131700\n(Oxford, 2000), ch. 7. 79 Levin, \u2018Heart and stomach of a king \u2019.\n80 I am exploring these issues in Counselling Elizabeth I : politics, queenship and public discourse\n(Cambridge, in preparation).\n81 Norbert Elias, U\u00a8ber den proze\u00df der Zivilisation (2 vols., Bern, 1969) ; Elias, The civilizing process, trans.\nEdmund Jephcott (2 vols., Oxford, 1978\u201382).\n82 Elias\u2019s arguments are effectively summarized in Jeroen Duindam,Myths of power : Norbert Elias and\nthe early modern court, trans. Lorri S. Granger and Gerard T. Moran (Amsterdam, [1994?]). Ju\u00a8rgen\nFreiherr von Kru\u00a8dener independently arrived at largely similar conclusions and has also been influ-\nential, see Kru\u00a8dener, Die rolle des hofes im absolutismus (Stuttgart, 1973).\n720 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\nAs with Neale and Elton, Elias\u2019s model has come under growing attack. In a detailed\ndissection based on research on the two dominant continental courts \u2013 Vienna and\nVersailles \u2013 Jeroen Duindam, for instance, has challenged Elias\u2019s emphasis on the bureau-\ncratic nature of early modern government and questioned the extent to which Elias\u2019s\nmodel can be applied to the nobility as a whole. He has reasserted the patrimonial nature\nof early modern monarchy, its reliance on reciprocal relations between monarchs\nand the elite, and has demonstrated not only the diversity of noble experience and activity\nat court but also that only a small minority (5 per cent under Louis XIV) were regularly at\ncourt.83 He has also questioned Elias\u2019s wider assumptions about the social and economic\ncontext and made valid criticisms about Elias\u2019s choice of sources (including his reliance on\nhostile sources, like Saint-Simon), his approach (specifically the relationship between\nhistory and sociology) and his definition of \u2018civilization\u2019, which privileged Western culture\nwhile ignoring relevant non-European comparisons, notably with China.84\nDespite these historiographical parallels, the study of court-based Tudor politics remains\nisolated from the broader field of court studies and the extent to which they are mutually\ninforming is limited. Individual works, like George Bernard\u2019s on the nobility and Peter\nMcCullough\u2019s Sermons at court, have responded directly to trends in court studies, either\nchallenging key aspects of Elias\u2019s model or reflecting the recent shift in the focus from\ndrama to religious ceremony and ritual. Otherwise, responses to key assumptions \u2013 about\nthe declining role of the nobility, the growing bureaucratic nature of governance, and the\n\u2018 top-down\u2019 nature of relationships between the monarch and courtiers \u2013 have not been\nplaced in a wider European context. Explorations of political, ideological, and cultural\nconnections between England and the continent have not generally been pursued inde-\npendently. John Guy has pointed to comparisons between Henrician and early Valois\ncounselling practices ; Diarmaid MacCulloch has convincingly shown how the Edwardian\nregime perceived itself, and attempted to establish itself, as the leading protestant centre in\nEurope while Jennifer Loach\u2019s and Thomas Mayer\u2019s studies of Edward VI and Cardinal\nPole respectively have emphasized the impact of Renaissance ideas and style on indi-\nviduals.85 But a wider comparison with the continent of policy-formulation, the structures\nof governance, the nature of court culture, and the role of courtiers remains unwritten. For\nexample, John Adamson\u2019s essay on the Tudor and Stuart courts in his collection The princely\ncourts of Europe is strong on culture but less effective in sketching the political activity of the\ncourt.86 If the parallels between developments in Tudor political and continental court\nhistoriography make such comparisons easier, then the perspectives that Bernard and\nMcCullough have brought to changing the way we understand Tudor politics suggest that\nsuch an approach would be mutually beneficial.\nDespite these problems, the contribution of established and junior academics to our\nunderstanding of Tudor politics over the past twenty years or so has been significant.\nThe work of George Bernard, David Starkey, Penry Williams, Simon Adams, Wallace\nMacCaffrey, and others has provided some convincing answers to the questions of the\nroles of social connections and ideology in early modern politics, raised by the work of\n83 Duindam, Myths of power, chs. 3 and 4. 84 Ibid., pp. 36\u20139, 184\u20137, 170\u20133.\n85 John Guy, \u2018The French king\u2019s council, 1485\u20131526\u2019, in Ralph A. Griffiths and James Sherbourne,\neds., Kings and nobles in the later middle ages (Gloucester and New York, 1986), pp. 274\u201394; MacCulloch,\nTudor church militant ; Loach, Edward VI, ch. 11 ; Mayer, Reginald Pole.\n86 John Adamson, \u2018The Tudor and Stuart courts, 1509\u20131714\u2019, in idem, ed., The princely courts of\nEurope : ritual, politics and culture under the Ancien-Re\u00b4gime, 1500\u20131700 (London, 1999), pp. 95\u2013117.\nH I S T O R I O G R A P H I C A L R E V I EW S 721\nJ. E. Neale and Conyers Read but not resolved by revisionists. The Tudors governed their\ndominions through a network of nobles and gentry rather than solely through institutional\nbodies like the privy council. Not only did this mean that the court was the main forum\nfor policy-making, but that issues of access to, and intimacy with, the monarch were\ncrucial. Studies of the court have shown how the Tudors adopted Renaissance ideas\nof princely magnificence, while interdisciplinary research on court drama and sermons\nhas demonstrated that political debate was polymorphic and not confined to conciliar\nmeetings. Reconstructions of the principles, beliefs, and actions of leading individuals\nhave helped chart connections between political theory and practical policy-making.\nThey have also highlighted points of contention between the monarch and their courtiers,\nespecially over female monarchy and the role of counsel in the second half of the sixteenth\ncentury. Some important areas remain to be integrated fully into this picture, notably\nthe role of women other than regnant queens. Evaluating the extent of political awareness\nand participation outside the court, as well as placing Tudor politics in a European\ncontext, would enrich our understanding still further. If the quality of contributions like\nBarbara Harris\u2019s \u2018Women in early Tudor politics \u2019, James Daybell\u2019s collection on women\u2019s\nletter-writing, Walker\u2019s The politics of performance, McCullough\u2019s Sermons at court, and\nFox\u2019s Oral and literate culture are representative, then there is a fruitful harvest to be reaped\nin these fields.\n722 H I S T O R I C A L J O U RN A L\n"}
