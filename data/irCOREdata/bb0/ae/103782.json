Part of this difficulty is that many\npractitioners do not have the necessary skills to\nimplement what are now considered effective\ninterventions. Training is therefore a significant issue\nin terms of the delivery of an evidence-based service.\nIn particular, appropriate types of training need to be\navailable to provide the workforce with the entire\nrange of skills to deliver an efficient and effective\nmodern mental health service. This paper reviews the\nevidence base for training in Psychosocial\nInterventions in an attempt to determine what is\nknown about the impact of PSI training, the quality\nof such research\/evaluation, and how this knowledge\nmight best be used to inform future purchasing \nand provision.\nMethod\nA comprehensive search of the literature was\nundertaken to identify all research papers written\nafter 1990 that had evaluated training in PSI.\nUsing systematic review methodology, Kirkpatrick\u2019s\n(1967) framework for the evaluation of training was\nused to structure the review which examines four\ndifferent types of outcome, namely, trainees\u2019 reaction\nto training, learning, behaviour change and benefits\nto those who receive a service from the trainees.\nIn addition, the focus and level of training was\ndifferentiated to allow for short in-service training,\nundergraduate and postgraduate training in family\ninterventions, specific individual interventions and\ngeneric training to be reviewed independently. \nResults\nThirty-seven papers met the criteria for inclusion in\nthe review. The greatest proportion of these papers\nhad evaluated training in family interventions or\ngeneric PSI training. The studies that addressed\nspecific individual interventions had only evaluated\nshort term training programmes leaving it unclear\nhow outcomes differ from longer-term training.\nFourteen of the papers were controlled studies \n(6 being randomised controlled trials), 11 were \ncross sectional and 12 used an uncontrolled \npre-post design. \nUsing Kirkpatrick\u2019s framework for the evaluation the\noutcomes can by summarised as follows:\nTrainee Reactions:\nSatisfaction with \u2018PSI\u2019 training has been evaluated\nboth in short in-house programmes \nand in longer term postgraduate programmes.\nStudies illustrate that trainees were consistently\nsatisfied with the training they received. Although\nonly two studies specifically evaluated the supervision\nassociated with postgraduate training, results were\nnot so positive. In sharp contrast to the reaction\ntowards specialist supervision provided by the\ntrainers, for example the majority of trainees in the\nMilne et al (2003) study did not believe the routine\nsupervision they received from their employing Trust\nmet their needs.\nEvidence: \nConsistent results were found in all eight studies \nthat evaluated trainee satisfaction with training: \ntwo of these were controlled and six uncontrolled. \nA number of rating scales were used to measure\ntrainee satisfaction, therefore, it is impossible to\ncompare results directly. In two in-depth, independent\nexternal evaluations, Carpenter et al (2003) and Milne\net al (2003) specifically assessed satisfaction with\nsupervision associated with postgraduate training.   \nexecutive\nExecutive\nSummary\npage 07\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nAttitudes and Beliefs:\nBecause of the fundamental values base within PSI\ntraining it is not surprising that nine studies, just\nunder a quarter of the total sample, evaluated\nchanges in attitudes and beliefs. On the whole, \nit would appear that PSI training in all its forms has \na positive effect on the attitudes and beliefs that\ntrainees hold about psychotic conditions (particularly\nbeliefs about cause and therapeutic optimism),\non service users with a psychosis and about available\npsychosocial interventions to help service users and\ncarers. \nEvidence: \nOf the nine studies looking at attitude change, \nonly two used the same assessment tool (Leff and \nGamble, 1995; Lancashire, 2003), making it\nimpossible to make general comparisons between\nstudies. However, a number of studies compared\ntrainee attitudes pre and post training, three of\nwhich were controlled.  Significant improvements\nwere reported at the end of training (Brabban, 2003;\nEwers, 2002; Lancashire, 2003; Leff & Gamble, 1995;\nThomas et al, 1999).\nAcquisitions of Knowledge:\nStudies that evaluated knowledge gain, tended to\nfind that specific elements of trainees\u2019 knowledge\nhad improved when tested immediately post training,\nirrespective of the length or specific type of training\nthey had received. Based on the results of the\nKavanagh et al (1993) study it is less clear how long\nnewly acquired knowledge is retained and what\nfactors preserve learning.\nEvidence:\nThirteen of the studies included in the review looked\nat knowledge gain as a result of PSI training (see\nsection 3.4.2), four of these were controlled trials\n(Lancashire, 2003; Thomas et al, 1999) two of which\nwere randomised (Ewers, 2002; Gray et al, 2003).\nAt the end of training, which ranged from 18 hours\nto two years, only two studies failed to find a\nsignificant increase in knowledge (Laube and Higson,\n2000; Willetts and Leff, 1997). However, both of these\nstudies had small sample sizes which could have\ncontributed to the non-significant results. Only\nKavanagh et al (1993), however, followed up trainees\nsome time later, post-training. They found that recall of\ncertain topics including CBT and behavioural strategies\nto be minimal. This was despite only 4% of trainees\nreporting they had a problem with knowledge.\nA variety of measures were used to determine level of\nknowledge within the 13 studies making it impossible\nto make cross study comparisons of trainees\u2019\nknowledge either pre or post training \nAcquisition of Skill: \nOn the whole trainees develop targeted skills when\nattending PSI training in all forms. However, because\nof the variety of methods used to rate skill\ndevelopment within the research and the frequent\nuse of self report, it is difficult to determine exactly\nwhat level of expertise is reached in each study and\nthereby ascertain what type of training is required\n(length and type) to teach skills to different levels.\nHaddock et al (1999) and Gray et al, (2003) both\nused the CTS, a validated measure of Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy skills to determine skill level pre\nand post training. Although both studies showed\nthat trainees had acquired significant skills, their\nactual level of skill post-training as rated by the \nCTS was moderate in relation to possible achievable\nscores. Only one study addressed specific trainee\nvariables in an examination of which individual\nfactors contribute to the greatest skill acquisition.\nGray et al, (2003), found that clinical skills pre-\ntraining, academic qualifications and attendance\nwere significant factors. \nEvidence\nSkill development has been evaluated most\nextensively within generic PSI training, however only\ntwo studies (Haddock et al, 1999; Gray et al, 2003)\nused a validated measure to measure this. Brooker\nand Butterworth (1993) rated audiotapes of trainees\u2019\nclinical work to determine skills acquisition and four\nstudies relied on self report (Brooker et al, 1996;\n2003; Repper, 2000; Bailey et al, 2003).\nExecutive\nSummary\npage 08\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nChange in Behaviour (Implementation): \nMost of the studies that relate to implementation are\nwell designed cross-sectional surveys that achieve a\nhigh response (see section 3.3.1). There is greatest\nconsistency in the research methods reported where\nthe implementation of PSI training has been\nevaluated. For example, five studies have used the\nsame instrument to evaluate the difficulty of\nimplementing family interventions in routine clinical\npractice (see Table 4, page 27). Common barriers to\nimplementation of family work include: allowance of\ntime in the service; integration with existing caseload\nand the availability of families. In addition, common\n\u2018boosters\u2019 to implementation have been consistently\nreported in all related studies: a critical number of\nstaff trained in the team; access to high quality\nsupervision; having the time to do the work and\npossessing enough skill to apply the intervention\nflexibly. Several studies point to the importance of\norganisational ownership of the implementation of\nPSI through Steering Groups constituted with senior\nmanager involvement. \nEvidence: \nImplementation of family intervention training:\nA number of well-designed cross sectional studies,\nachieving a high response, have reported similar\nbarriers to the implementation of family interventions\ntraining (Kavanagh et al, 1993; Fadden, 1997;\nCampbell, 1999; Baguley et al, 2002; Bailey, 2003)\nImplementation of PSI Training: A number of high\nquality cross-sectional studies have shown that there\nare identifiable factors that can facilitate the\nimplementation of PSI training: team training \n(Bailey, 2003; Lancashire, 2003); access to\nappropriate supervision (Brooker et al, 2003; \nBailey, 2003; Teamwork, 2001) and organisational\nownership and support (Brooker et al, 2003; \nMilne, 2000 and Carpenter et al, 2003). \nBenefits to Service Users and Carers: \nBenefits to service users and carers have been found\nin the majority of relevant studies. There are three\ntimes as many studies reporting outcomes for service\nusers (n=12) compared to carers (n=4). The service\nuser studies are of variable quality with just seven out\nof 12 employing controlled designs. Improvements in\nservice users\u2019 symptoms were reported in six out of\nseven controlled studies. The one study where\nsymptoms did not improve was underpowered and\nsuffered from serious problems with attrition (Kapur,\n2002). Social and general functioning improved in\nseven of the nine studies where it was measured but\nonly three of these studies were controlled.  \nOnly four studies have examined outcomes for carers.\nThree of these studies relate to the same 20-day\ntraining for family intervention reported by Brooker\nand colleagues (Brooker, 1992a; 1992b; 1994). In the\nother paper, Leff et al (2001) the impact of training\nin family intervention on family environment was\nexamined. There are too few studies, measuring\ndiverse outcomes, to draw any meaningful\nconclusions. It is clear that more research is needed\nthat examines the impact of PSI training from the\nrelative\u2019s perspective.  \nWhether outcomes focus on service users or carers it\nis difficult to extricate the essential ingredients of a\nsuccessful training programme as it would seem that\nmost findings seem to occur independently of either\nthe length or type of training.\nEvidence: \nImprovement in service users\u2019 symptoms:\nIn the vast majority of the controlled studies service\nusers\u2019 symptoms improve at variable follow-up\nperiods following PSI training (Brooker et al, [1992;\n1994]; Carpenter et al, 2003; Gray et al, 2003;\nMiklowitz et al, 2000; Turkington et al, 2002).  \nImprovement in service users\u2019 social functioning:\nIt is possible that after PSI training service user\u2019s social\nfunctioning improves but the evidence is not strong\n(Brooker et al, [1992; 1994]; Carpenter et al, 2003;\nFarhall and Cotton, 2002; Lancashire et al, 1997;\nLancashire et al [in submission]; Milne et al, 2002). \nDiscussion\nAlthough training in psychosocial interventions is a\nrelative newcomer to the mental health arena it has\nbeen evaluated more extensively than other types of\npost qualifying mental health training (Bailey et al,\n2003). Moreover, results show that PSI training has\npotential benefits for trainees across a number of\ndomains including positive changes in knowledge,\nattitudes and beliefs as well as skills and behaviour\nchange. In addition, PSI training appears to have a\npositive impact on the experiences of service users\nand their carers. \nPSI training comes in many different forms both in\nterms of the focus and the length of training.\nHowever, it is difficult to determine what particular\ntraining is required to achieve specific levels of\nExecutive\nSummary\npage 09\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nknowledge and skill in this field. In addition, it is\nevident that a wide range of factors contribute to the\nsuccessful transfer of learning into practice: caseload\nsize, supervision and peer support are particular\nissues that need to be addressed by organisations.\nConclusions\nThe range of attitudes, values and skills incorporated\nwithin \u2018PSI\u2019 have been recognised as necessary\ncomponents of a mental health service underpinned\nby an evidence and values base. However,\nimplementation of these diverse capabilities will\nrequire a substantial investment in training. Studies\nto date, although varying widely in methodological\nquality, suggest that PSI training programmes do\npromote a \u2018recovery\u2019 focused perspective and provide\nthe knowledge and skills for trainees to implement\nevidence based psychosocial interventions, though an\nindividual training programme will not necessarily\nprovide all of these elements. Owing to a lack of\noperational benchmarks, it is less clear what level of\nskills can be attained from different forms of PSI\ntraining or what constitutes the most efficient form\nof training. Evidently, mental health team members\nrequire different types of skill and levels of expertise\nin the numerous components of PSI: stakeholders in\nmental health training need to be mindful of this \nand ensure that available training opportunities\nreflect this span.\nRecommendations\nResearch and evaluation of PSI programmes\n\u0002 The national PSI implementation group within\nNIMHE should create a national forum for all\nPSI training providers in order to agree\nconsistent methods and measures to audit\noutcomes and quality of training. (This has\nrecently been undertaken by the group)\n\u0002 Research money is required in order to develop\nreliable validated measures of all PSI skills.\n\u0002 More follow-up studies should be conducted to\ndetermine the preservation of trainees\u2019\nattitudes, knowledge and skill over time.\n\u0002 More controlled studies are required to measure\nthe impact of PSI training, particularly from the\nservice user and family perspective. \n\u0002 To date there has been a paucity of research\nconsidering outcomes of training for families\nand carers. More work is required in this area.\n\u0002 Secondary analysis of the studies included in\nthis review should be undertaken in an attempt\nto examine the relationship between factors\nsuch as the quality of the research, the type of\ntraining and outcomes for service users.\nCommissioning of PSI programmes\n\u0002 Commissioners and training providers should\nuse the typology of skill types outlined on page\n15 to negotiate the likely outcome for trainees\nfrom each programme.\n\u0002 In line with the findings from this review,\ncommissioners and Trusts should be mindful\nthat upon completion of PSI training\npractitioners may not have the skills to\nimplement complex formulation driven\ntherapies (level 3 skills) and may require\nadditional experience, supervision and\/ or\ntraining to acquire this level of skill.\n\u0002 The National PSI Implementation Group should\nreview the content of current PSI training\nprogrammes and recommend a core-curriculum\nfor courses taught at different levels. This\nshould reflect the evidence and values base,\nnational policy and guidelines including topics\nsuch as Cultural Competency, Recovery Based\nPractice and Risk Management.\n\u0002 Discussions should take place between local\nstakeholders to determine local training needs\nprior to the commissioning process. This should\ninclude commissioners, training providers and\nTrusts. A good example of this is illustrated\nwithin the South Yorkshire PSI Implementation\nStrategy Document (Brooker and Linde, 2002) \n\u0002 Commissioners and Trusts should consider\nputting in place mechanisms to address the\ncomplex issues related to implementation in\ndifferent service areas. From the evidence base\nit would be expected that different functional\nteams will have distinct issues to address in\nrelation to implementation. For example, \nEarly Intervention teams with small caseloads, \na clear focus, and a PSI philosophy should find\nit easier to translate theory into practice than a\nCommunity Mental Health Team with larger\ncaseloads, a diverse client group and competing\ndemands.\nExecutive\nSummary\npage 10\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nOver the coming months the National PSI\nImplementation Group will be addressing potential\nimplications of this review for commissioners.\nHowever, it is evident that commissioners will need to\nconsider a number of issues including the following:\n\u0002 Should individuals or teams be trained? \n\u0002 Is expert supervision available within the\nstudent\u2019s organisation?   \n\u0002 Is there support for the training at the highest\norganisational level? \n\u0002 Is sufficient resource available to the student to\nundertake the intervention (e.g. caseload size)\nBackground\nchapter one\npage 11\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nchapter1\nA Scoping Review of Psychosocial Interventions Training for Work with\nPeople with Serious Mental Health Problems\n1 Background\n\u0001\nIn the last fifteen years, there has been a radical\nparadigm shift in the understanding and reatment\nof psychosis. Until recently the Kraepelinian view of\nschizophrenia as a chronic deteriorating condition\nappears to have prevailed across the UK; mental\nhealth care has focused on symptoms rather than\nthe sufferer and service users have been given little \nif any hope of recovery. In this climate,\npharmacological interventions have often been seen\nas the only effective treatment option available for\npeople with severe mental illness with psychosocial\ninterventions perceived as offering little more than\nauxiliary support.   \nTimes have changed however, and the dialectics of\nrecent national guidance is evidence of this swing.\nMoving away from symptoms towards service user\norientated services, mental health care is now\nfocussed on \u2018recovery\u2019 (National Institute for Mental\nHealth, [NIMHE], 2003) and the crucial role that\npsychosocial interventions can play has been\nestablished. After reviewing the research evidence,\nthe National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)\nconcluded that family interventions for people with \nschizophrenia and their families could effectively\nreduce the relapse rate compared to standard care\n(NICE, 2002). In addition, they summarised that\ncognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) could improve \nmental state and could also lead to reduced relapse\nwhen the treatment was implemented for more\nthan three months. As a result, NICE recommended\nthat both family interventions and CBT should be\navailable routinely for people diagnosed with\nschizophrenia.  \nThe trend towards psychosocial interventions being\navailable routinely is also reflected in National Policy\nImplementation Guidance that emphasises the need\nfor family interventions and cognitive therapy as\nintegral to new service models and delivery.\nOne example of this is assertive outreach where\nstructured family interventions are advocated\n(see page 31, Department of Health, 2001).\nThese national recommendations have been perceived\nas a breakthrough in the treatment of psychosis, with\nmental health services moving towards a more holistic\ntreatment approach. However, providing guidance on\nwhat should be available is only the start of a long\nand difficult implementation process: the gulf\nbetween theory and practice is enormous and the\ndifficulties of implementing evidence-based practice\nhave been extensively documented (Repper and\nBrooker, 2002; Fadden, 1997).\nProviding staff with the skills to implement\npsychosocial interventions, although by no means\nthe only means to achieve implementation, is a\ncrucial determinant of whether services are able to\nprovide best practice that is based on evidence.\nEnsuring the availability of appropriate, cost-\neffective training is therefore vital and to achieve\nthis requires a well informed, strategic approach to\nthe commissioning and provision of PSI training\nprogrammes. Commissioners should be aware of\nexactly what training is needed, at what level, how\nit should be delivered and to whom (Brooker et al,\n2002).\nBackground\nchapter one\npage 12\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n1.1 What training should be provided?\nKnowing exactly what training is required to skill the\nworkforce to deliver psychosocial interventions is\nobviously fundamental to effective implementation.\nHowever, it is not always clear exactly what is\nembraced by the now ubiquitous term \u2018PSI\u2019.\nThe PSI acronym has its origins in the Thorn Training\nprogrammes that began in the early 1990s in\nLondon and Manchester. These programmes\ntargeted community mental health nurses and\nsought to address the paucity of available training\nin problem-centred case management, cognitive\nbehaviour therapy and family interventions (see for\nexample Baguley et al, 2000). As our understanding\nof effective interventions has increased, so PSI has\nevolved and the term is now used as shorthand for\n\u2018evidence based psychosocial interventions for\npsychoses\u2019. However, the simplification of\nPsychosocial Interventions for Psychosis into the\nsingular, brand name of \u2018PSI\u2019 has brought with it\nsome disadvantages. The \u2018PSI\u2019 abbreviation\ncondenses a diversity of attitudes, models, and skills\ninto a simple singularity that can be readily\ndismissed or misunderstood. This reductionism can\naccount for many of the misconceptions that are\napparent: \u201cWe already do PSI\u201d, \u201cour service isn\u2019t\nready for PSI yet\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s the latest fad\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t\nagree with it.\u201d These dichotomous arguments\nbecome more difficult to support once \u2018PSI\u2019 gets\nunpacked to acknowledge the broad spectrum of\npsychosocial interventions that exist and that can be\nunderstood and practised at varying levels of\nsophistication and skill.\nThe range of attributes required to practice PSI\ninclude a set of core values, attitudes and inter-\npersonal skills, through assessment and therapeutic\ntechniques to the capability to deliver complex\nformulation driven therapies. Successful\nimplementation of PSI does not require each person\nin a mental health team to have every skill; however,\nthe full range of competencies does need be evident\nwithin that particular service. Unpacking PSI into its\nessential components should enable stakeholders\ninvolved with workforce development to assess\nwhether training programmes are meeting local\nneeds and should also help in the process of\nidentifying gaps in provision.  \nMost often, PSI is seen as equivalent to cognitive\nbehavioural orientated family and individual\npsychological interventions such as CBT, however,\nthese interventions are only the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019\nand have to be built upon a core set of values and\ncapabilities. These essential skills should be intrinsic\nwithin all PSI training and practice and include an\nemphasis on respecting and supporting service users\nand their carers, promoting recovery, identifying and\nworking with people\u2019s needs and strengths,\nrecognising and dealing with social inequality and\nexclusion as well as working with the complex\nbalance between promoting safety and positive risk\ntaking. These core competencies are reflected in the\n\u201cThe 10 Essential Shared Capabilities\u201d that have been\ndeveloped jointly by the National Institute of Mental\nHealth in England and the Sainsbury Centre (2004).\nAt the other end of the PSI spectrum, and in line\nwith national guidance (NICE, 2002), service users\nwith a diagnosis of schizophrenia and their carers\nshould also have access to CBT and family\ninterventions. Once again, however, implementing\nthis guideline can sometimes be hindered by\nconfusion with the terminology. These apparently\nstraightforward therapy terms encompass a myriad\nof \u2018sub-species\u2019 or brands of individual CBT and\nfamily intervention - not all of which have an\nevidence base in the treatment of psychosis.\nIn addition these interventions can be practiced at\nvarying levels of expertise, for example, practitioners\nwho can implement a few cognitive therapy\ntechniques should not be regarded as cognitive\ntherapists who would have the skills to offer a full\ncourse of cognitive therapy. Similarly, practitioners\nwho can provide stand-alone psycho-education to\nfamilies should not be perceived necessarily as\noffering family interventions per se. PSI training\nprogrammes provide CBT and family intervention\ntraining at many different levels: introductory and\nintermediate courses will often not equip students\nto implement therapies as such but will introduce\nstudents to concepts and theories; a reality that can\nbe at odds with the expectations of service\nmanagers. PSI training can, therefore, be\nconceptualised at the three main levels of training\ndescribed below in Figure 1.\n1.2 How Should PSI Training Be\nDelivered?\nSince 1992, over 80 new PSI programmes have been\nestablished in England, ranging from short\nintroductory courses, through to diploma and MSc\nlevel programmes (Brooker, 2002). However, despite\nthe substantial investment in PSI training over the\nBackground\nchapter one\npage 13\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nlast decade there remains a substantial shortage of\nstaff with skills to implement the requirements of a\nModern Mental Health Service laid out in the Mental\nHealth National Service Framework (2000) and\nrelated Policy Implementation Guidance. For the\ngold standard to be reached a strategic approach\nmust be taken towards training provision and\ncommissioning - it is essential that training is both\neffective and efficient. Although the evidence base\nprovides direction in service provision, the same\nprinciples do not appear to drive the training\nagenda: little attention appears to be paid to the\noutcomes of training programmes and whether\nthese are the most effective and efficient methods\nof delivery. Analogous to treatment provision,\noutcomes of training should be assessed properly\nand key stakeholders, especially commissioners,\nshould also be aware of the evidence of \u2018what\nworks for whom\u2019 (Roth and Fonaghy, 1986).\n1.3 Aims of the review\nThis review has synthesised the available evidence on\nPSI training since 1990 with the aim of establishing:\n\u0002 The extent to which PSI training has been\nevaluated  \n\u0002 The types of PSI training that have been\nevaluated \n\u0002 The outcomes that have been assessed for\nservice users, carers and trainees\nOverall, the aim of the review is to determine\nwhat is known about the impact of PSI training,\nthe quality of such research\/ evaluation, and how\nthis knowledge might best be used to inform future\npurchasing and provision.\nFigure 1: A Model of Skill Types within Psychosocial Interventions\nType A skills could be seen as the \u2018core\u2019 values, understanding and skills needed to practice\npsychosocial interventions. Intrinsic within would be general therapeutic optimism with an appreciation\nof a philosophy of \u2018recovery\u2019. Practitioners at this level would display good interpersonal and\nengagement skills.\nType B equates to the toolbox of manualised\/prescribed skills. Practitioners with these skills would have\nvarying levels of competency to administer and interpret a variety of psychometric assessments and be\ncapable of executing prescribed interventions such as psycho-education or problem solving. Practitioners\nwith these skills (without Type C skill) would be working as technicians, in other words would be able to\ncarry out skilled interventions but may not understand fully the theoretical models behind their actions.\nType C skills equate to the ability to devise a sophisticated therapeutic intervention based on the sound\nunderstanding of a range of relevant therapeutic models (potentially wider than merely cognitive-\nbehavioural). With C type skills practitioners should be capable of providing complex, formulation driven\nand individually adapted therapeutic interventions.\nNote: It should be noted that this model of skill types does not propose that the three categories are\ninterdependent \u2013 one can possess one type of skill without the other. A practitioner may have very good\nB type skills (be able to carry out a standardised assessment and intervention) but might not hold the\nappropriate values (e.g. therapeutic optimism) that one would equate with a psychosocial approach to\npsychosis (Type A skills). Alternatively it could be that a person has a broad understanding of theoretical\nmodels and is capable of devising complex treatment plans accommodating a variety of variables (Type C\nskills) and yet lack practical skills (B Type skills) to implement them. In addition it should be noted that\neach skill type, be it A, B or C, can be present at varying levels of competence.\nSOURCE: Brabban, A (2001) Internal Strategy Document \u2013 County Durham and Darlington Priority\nServices Trust\nMethod\nchapter two\npage 14\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n2 Method  \n\u0001\nA comprehensive literature review was undertaken\ndrawing upon systematic review methodology\n(NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, (2001).\n2.1 Search Strategy\nA comprehensive literature search was undertaken in\nAugust-September 2003 to identify all literature\nrelating to the evaluation of psychosocial interventions\ntraining. A wide range of electronic bibliographic\ndatabases were searched, covering the medical,\nhealth, nursing, psychological\/ psychiatric, educational,\nsocial science, science, and grey literature (including\ncurrent research):\n1.

No date, study or publication type\nrestrictions were applied to the strategy. However,\nsearches were restricted to English language papers\nonly. A sample search strategy (Ovid Medline) is\nprovided in Appendix 1. A general Internet search\nwas also performed on Google\u2122. In addition, citation\nsearches were performed on key authors and papers,\nidentified by the review team, in the Science and\nSocial Sciences Citation Indexes and the reference\nlists of included studies were checked for\nadditional studies.\nIn order to identify the grey literature an e-mail\nmessage was sent to the representative of each\nHigher Education Institution (HEI) that had been\nidentified as the lead member of the Academic\nNetwork for Mental Health Nursing. The aim of the\nreview was outlined and a request was made for\nunpublished evaluations of PSI training that met the\ncriteria outlined in Appendix 2 and section 2.2 below.\nA similar request was made of members of the\nNational PSI Implementation Group in NIMHE. \nchapter2\nMethod\nchapter two\npage 15\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n2.2 Inclusion criteria\nStudies were included in the final list of included\npapers if they met the following criteria:\na) The population being trained was anyone working\nwith or caring for someone with a psychotic\ndisorder\nb) The intervention that was taught was to have been\ndelivered to service users who had a psychotic\ndisorder\nc) The training could be predominantly defined as PSI\n(see definition in Appendix 2)\nd) The study reported at least one quantifiable\noutcome\ne) The evaluation of training had been planned and\nwas not part of routine course\/programme audit.\nf) The report of the study was published in or after\n1990 (no studies published in or before 1989 were\nincluded) when the term PSI was first coined.\n2.3 Assessing the Quality of Included\nStudies\nIn order to extract data consistently a checklist was\ndesigned (see appendix 3), adapted from one\npreviously reported by Walburn et al (2001).\nThe studies were then independently assessed.\nLevel Outcome\n1 Learners\u2019 reactions\n2a Modification of attitudes & values\n2b Acquisition of knowledge & skills\nLevel Outcome\n3 Change in behaviour\n4a Change in organisational practice\n4b Benefits to service users & carers\nFigure 2: Kirkpatrick\u2019s Framework for Outcomes (1967) as Adapted by Barr et al (1999)\n2.4 Structure of Review\nA number of stakeholders have an investment in\npsychosocial interventions training programmes\nparticularly trainees, service users, carers as well as the\nwider organisation; for this reason the outcomes for\neach of these groups are reviewed independently\nwithin Kirkpatrick\u2019s (1967) framework for the\nevaluation of training. Kirkpatrick\u2019s model identifies\nfour different levels of outcome namely: reaction to\ntraining, learning, behaviour change and results for\nthose who receive a service from the trainees.\nRecently Barr et al (1999) expanded the model and\nsubdivided \u2018learning\u2019, separating out the impact on\nattitudes from the impact on knowledge and skills. \nThe \u2018results\u2019 level was also expanded to differentiate\nbetween impact on those that the training is designed\nto benefit, (which for the purpose of this review,\nequates to users of services and their carers) and the\neffect on practice within organisations. All studies\ndrawn upon for this aspect of the review are listed in\nAppendix 7.\n3 Results  \nResults\nchapter three\npage 16\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n\u0001\n3.1 Total of included studies\nApproximately 400 abstracts were identified from an\ninitial list of approximately 2000 generated from the\ninitial search described in Section 2.1. All three\nmembers of the review team (CB, AB and PR)\nassessed the abstracts. It was agreed that 96 studies\nmight meet the criteria given their titles. Two of the\nteam (AB and PR) then assessed the full versions of\nthe papers independently. There was 100%\nagreement that 31 studies met the inclusion criteria\nand that 59 did not. There was disagreement about\nthe remaining six studies. A meeting was held,\nchaired by CB, where the remaining 6 studies were\ndiscussed. It was agreed by all three of the team\n(AB, PR and CB) that a further 3 out of these six\nstudies met the a priori criteria. The formal search\nthus generated 34 studies for inclusion. The search\nof the grey literature uncovered 3 studies \u2013 all local\nevaluations of training not in the published literature\n- that it was agreed should also be included. Thus a\nfinal total of 37 studies were finally included and\nthese are listed in Appendix 7. The included studies\nare also categorised into those that contain outcomes\nfor service users (Table 6); those that contain\noutcomes for carers (Table 7) and those that include\noutcomes for trainees (Table 2). A number of studies\nmeasured outcomes for more than one of the three \ngroups so total numbers do not sum to 37. The 59\nstudies that were excluded are listed at Appendix 8\nwhere more detail is presented about reasons for\nexclusion.\n3.2 Course type by course content\nIn the Background section it was argued that\n\u2018psychosocial interventions\u2019 (PSI) is a broad term\nthat covers all non-pharmacological evidence-based\ninterventions used in work with people with a\npsychosis and their families. Similarly the type of\ntraining that has been evaluated is almost as varied\nwith accredited courses offered in HEIs (at\nundergraduate and postgraduate levels) and a wide\nrange of in-house programmes offered within mental\nhealth services. The distribution of evaluated\nprogrammes by course type and provider is shown in\nTable 1 below. There are features of this distribution\nthat are worthy of comment.\nFirst, it is clear that the overwhelming focus of\nevaluated PSI training is on generic courses (17\nstudies) and family work programmes (15 studies).\nThe evaluation of generic programmes is evenly\nspread across in-house, undergraduate and\npostgraduate programmes whereas all family\nprogramme studies are either in-house or\nundergraduate. The only courses that have reported\noutcomes for individual interventions, (where the\ncourse has been designed specifically to teach\ntrainees one intervention targeted at the service user),\nhave all been short in-house programmes. In total\nthere have been very few evaluations of postgraduate\ncourses, however, only four such programmes exist\n(Sheffield, Birmingham, Manchester and Sunderland)\nand each of these has at least one reported study. \nchapter3\nResults\nchapter three\npage 17\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nTable 1: PSI Course Type by Focus of course\nIn House\nUndergraduate\nPostgraduate\nFamily Work\nCampbell (1999)\nFadden (1997)\nLaube & Higson\n(2000)\nLeff et al (2001)\nMiklowitz et al (2000)\nKavanagh et al (1993)\nThomas et al (1999)\nBaguley et al (2000)\nBailey et al (2003)\nBrooker et al (1992a)\nBrooker et al (1992b)\nBrooker &\nButterworth (1993)\nBrooker et al (1994)\nLeff & Gamble (1995)\nLancashire (2003)\nGeneric\nBailey (2004)\nBrooker et al (1996)\nEwers (2002)\nKapur (2002)\nMilne et al (2000a)\nMilne et al (2000b)\nMilne et al (2001)\nWillets & Leff (1997)\nBrooker et al (2003)\nGray et al (2001) \nHaddock et al (1999)\nLancashire et al (1997)\nLancashire et al (2004)\nTeamwork Management\nServices (2004)\nBrooker et al (2003) \nCarpenter et al (2003)\nMilne et al (2003) \nRepper (2000)\nTeamwork Management\nServices (2004)\nIndividual Interventions\nBrabban (2003) \nFarhall & Cotton (2002)\nGray et al (2001)\nGray et al (2003)\nTurkington et al (2002)\n3.3 Design of included studies\n3.3.1 Cross-sectional studies\nAppendix 4 describes several important features of\nthe cross-sectional studies. In many of these studies\nthe focus is on the extent to which taught skills have\nbeen maintained, often in the specific area of family\nwork for psychosis. An important strand of this\nresearch has shown, mostly through trainee\u2019s self\nreport, that the implementation of family work is\nhighly problematic. Most studies report survey\nresponse rates ranging from 45% to 100% over\nreasonable follow-up periods (often 1-2 years after\ntraining). Although some caution is necessary the\nlikelihood of systematic bias being introduced\nthrough high non-response is accordingly low in\nmost of the studies. Very often the same tool has\nbeen used to compare aspects of the implementation\nof family work and this allows a useful comparison to\nbe drawn (Tables 6 and 7). \n3.3.2 Uncontrolled studies\nThe features of uncontrolled studies are outlined in\nAppendix 5. The vast majority of these are simple\nbefore and after designs (n=9) with different\nvarieties of training designated as the intervention.\nIn addition, three studies also include a variable\nperiod of follow-up. A variety of outcomes are\nassessed including trainees\u2019 knowledge, skills and\nattitudes; the frequency and severity of service users\u2019\nsymptoms and social functioning; and success in the\nimplementation of the taught skills. In the great\nmajority of studies the outcomes reported are usually\nsignificant improvements in the direction of the\nresearcher\u2019s hypothesis. However, without any\ncontrols, it is difficult to ascribe these changes to the\ntraining interventions. A number of the studies\ntriangulate the findings with qualitative data (see for\nexample, Barnes et al 2000) thereby adding weight\nto some of the uncontrolled quantitative findings. \n3.3.3 Controlled studies\nAppendix 6 outlines the features of the 14 controlled\nstudies that have been undertaken. Only two of these\n12 studies have used a power calculation to estimate\nsample size (Turkington et al, 2002; Gray et al, 2003).\nThe longest follow-up period reported is 12 months\n(4\/11 studies) with three papers reporting follow-up\nat 6 months. Attrition of the samples at follow-up\nvaries from 0-43%. The randomised controlled trial\nreported by Turkington and colleagues, cited above,\nwas probably the highest quality study on\nmethodological grounds, i.e. power was calculated,\nsample size was large, and attrition at follow-up was\nlow (12%). Similarly, and using the same criteria,\nGray et al\u2019s paper, also cited above, was also a well\nconducted trial. Both papers are concerned with\nshort in-house programmes for individual\ninterventions. Turkington and his colleagues trained\nmental health nurses to deliver CBT in a short training\nprogramme - the primary outcome measure of\ninterest was the overall symptomatology of service\nusers. Gray and his colleagues described a short\ntraining intervention for mental health nurses that\nassessed the primary outcome of service user\u2019s\ncompliance with medication. Methodological\nproblems notwithstanding, all the papers reported a\nsignificant training effect \n3.4 Kirkpatrick\u2019s Framework for the\nEvaluation of Training\n3.4.1 Level 1 Outcomes: Trainee Reactions\nIn this section, studies that have evaluated trainees\u2019\nsatisfaction with a PSI training programme are\nreviewed.\nSatisfaction with the training programme was\nconsidered in eight of the papers with results showing\nunanimous satisfaction for both short in-house training\n(Campbell, 1999; Milne et al, 2000(a); Brabban,\n2003; Willetts & Leff, 1997; and Kapur, 2002) and\ntwo-year postgraduate programmes (Milne et al, 2003;\nCarpenter et al, 2003; and Teamwork Management\nServices, 2001). Trainees on the Birmingham University\npostgraduate programme (Carpenter et al, 2003)\ncommented that the inter-professional nature of the\ntraining was particularly beneficial for overcoming\nprofessional differences and prejudices - for this reason\nthe trainees (nurses, social workers and occupational\ntherapists) were disappointed that the training had not\nattracted more psychiatrists and psychologists.\nNevertheless, some professional stereotyping was still\nevident. Trainees on a postgraduate programme at\nSunderland University also commented on the benefits\nof having a shared inter-profession conceptual\nframework for psychosis in the form of the stress-\nvulnerability model (Milne et al 2003).\nSupervision is also provided or at least considered on\nmost post-basic PSI training courses, however, the form\nthis takes varies between programmes with some\ncourses providing \u2018in house\u2019 supervision and others\ncontracting employing organisations to provide this.\nMilne et al (2003) evaluated trainees\u2019 reaction to \u2018in\nResults\nchapter three\npage 18\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nResults\nchapter three\npage 19\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nhouse\u2019 supervision and reported that the majority\nperceived the supervision as meeting their needs to \u2018a\nlarge extent\u2019 or \u2018fully\u2019. This was in stark contrast to\ntrainee\u2019s evaluation of routine Trust supervision which\n74% rated as not meeting their needs. Worryingly, this\nfinding was repeated when evaluating a second cohort\nattending the Sunderland programme. On the\nBirmingham programme, where aspects of supervision\nwere provided by the sponsoring Trust, experiences\nwere more wide ranging - varying between \u2018excellent\u2019\nand \u2018failed\u2019. Students specifically mentioned the\nadvantages of having clinical psychologists as tutors\nbecause of their skills and experience in psychological\nmethods (Carpenter et al 2003).\n3.4.2 Level 2 Outcomes: Learning\nThe second level of Kirkpatrick\u2019s framework for\nevaluating training (1967) focuses specifically on\nlearning gained from the training. Barr et al (1999)\ndivided this second level into two separate categories:\nchanges to attitudes and perceptions and the\nacquisition of knowledge.\nLevel 2a: Impact on Attitudes and\nPerceptions\nPositive attitudes towards service users with psychosis\nand their carers are fundamental to all mental health\nservice provision. Within PSI training the values base is\noften promoted strongly. Nine studies have evaluated\nwhether PSI training has had an impact on the attitudes\nand values of the trainees (Brooker & Butterworth,\n1993; Leff & Gamble, 1995; Thomas, 1998; Repper,\n2000; Ewers, 2002; Brabban 2003; Carpenter et al\n2003; Lancashire, 2003, Brooker et al, 2003).  \na) Attitudes Towards Schizophrenia \nThe concept of \u2018Attitudes towards schizophrenia\u2019\nincorporates a wide range of beliefs and attributions\nabout the cause and outcome of schizophrenia and\nsubsequent values and beliefs regarding the treatment\nand management of a person with schizophrenia and\nhis or her carers. \nThe in-house PSI training course evaluated by Ewers\n(2002) aimed \u201cto move staff away from a medical\nmodel of \u2018cure or ill\u2019 towards a \u2018more flexible and\ncreative way of seeing patients\u2019 problems\u201d. Changes in\nattitudes were measured on a previously untested scale\ndeveloped specifically for the study. Forensic mental\nhealth nurses who had received training showed\nsignificant improvements compared with a control\ngroup who had not - this related to more \u201crealistic\nand positive attitudes towards their patients\u2019 care\u201d.\nIn an evaluation of an undergraduate family\ninterventions programme Leff & Gamble (1995)\nassessed attitude change using the Attitudes and\nAssumptions Questionnaire (AAQ) that focuses on\nissues relating to schizophrenia and associated family\ninterventions. Four cohorts of students showed\nsignificant improvements in attitudes towards family\ninterventions - for three cohorts this was evident after\ntwo months of training, though all four groups\nshowed significant positive change at nine months.\nLancashire (2003) used the same measure of attitudes\nand beliefs to evaluate changes in trainees completing\ntwo modules of family intervention training and found\nchanges of a similar magnitude to that of Leff and\nGamble (1995). Thomas et al (1999) also found a shift\nin staff attitudes (n = 20) where six sessions of\n\u2018Practitioner Training about Families\u2019 were provided.\nCompared to a control group who did not receive\ntraining, staff showed a significantly positive attitude\ntowards providing information to families and teaching\nskills to families. No significant difference between the\ngroups was found in attitudes towards providing\nsupport to families.\nIn her study of the Sheffield University postgraduate\nPSI programme, Repper, (2000) reported that all the\nstudents in the study acknowledged that their attitudes\nhad changed towards people with psychosis.\n\u201cThey came to see them as people with experiences\nthat had meaning and could be understood in the\ncontext of their lives: essentially \u2018people who had value\nand could be helped.\u201d\nShe found that that overall, trainees developed a more\npositive and hopeful attitude towards the client group\nthat permeated all aspects of their work. The change in\nattitude found by Repper was also evident in a follow\nup study that targeted students on the same training\nprogramme. Students who had undergone training in\nPSI at either the University of Sheffield (postgraduate\ncourse) or the Institute of Psychiatry (undergraduate\nThorn Training) at least one year earlier, were asked to\nrate themselves compared to pre-training (Brooker et\nal, 2003). Respondents (n = 96) stressed how their\nattitudes had changed, 31 reported that they were\nmore optimistic that outcomes could be improved - \n30 believed they had increased understanding and\n18 stated an increased recognition of the value of\nengaging and working with families, collaborative work\nwith clients and normalising their experience.  \nResults\nchapter three\npage 20\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nAuthor Year of Focus of Type of Length of Number in\npublication Training Training Training Experimental\nGroup\nBaguley I et al 2000 Family Interventions Undergraduate Manchester Thorn 21\n(72 Days)\nBailey, C. 2003 Generic PSI In Service 20 days 27\nBailey, R et al 2003 Family Interventions Undergraduate 1 year (accredited) 15\nBrabban, A. 2003 CBT In Service 5 days 12\nBrooker, C. et al 1996 Generic PSI In Service 8 days 49\nBrooker C & 1993 Family Interventions Undergraduate 20 days 17\nButterworth, C\nBrooker, C et al 2003 Generic PSI Postgraduate Institute of Psychiatry 96\nThorn & Sheffield Uni \nPSI M.Sc.

Despite student\u2019s\nhigh baseline scores, the psychosocial perspective\nevident at the outset of training was strengthened\nfurther at six month follow-up (\u03c72 = 7.2, p= 0.06)\nthis, however, did not attain significance and so is\nreported here as a trend.\nb) Attitudes Towards Treatments\nThree studies examined whether there was a post-\ntraining change in attitude towards treatment of\nschizophrenia.  \nTwelve months after completing undergraduate\ntraining in Family Interventions, Brooker and\nButterworth (1993) found that a group of CPNs\n(N= 8) had changed their rank order rating of the\nusefulness of general interventions. Family stress\nmanagement packages replaced major tranquillizers as\nthe top-ranked item. In an American study Thomas et\nal (1999) also found a significant improvement in\nattitudes towards providing families with information\nand to teaching them skills following 18 hours of\n\u2018Practitioner Training about Families\u2019 (PTF) compared to\nthe control group.\nBrabban (2003) also looked at beliefs about treatment\nbefore and after a short multi-disciplinary training \nin-house programme in CBT of Psychosis. Though the\nsample size was small (n = 12) she found a significant\nincrease in rating the importance of \u2018Individual\nTherapies for Psychosis\u2019 at the end of the training.\nNo significant changes were found in the ratings of\nother treatment modalities including medication or\nfamily interventions.\nc) Attitudes Towards Community Mental\nHealth Services\nIn a comprehensive evaluation of the West Midlands\npostgraduate Community Mental Health training\nprogramme that incorporates tuition on PSI, Carpenter\net al (2003) looked at changes in specific attitudes\nintrinsic to community health care.\nFrom the outset trainees endorsed the values and\nprinciples of good community care and although some\nfurther significant shifts were reported, consistent\npositive attitudes were recorded throughout. However,\nafter receiving training two out of the three cohorts\nshowed a stronger agreement with the proposition,\n\u201cTo set up a community mental health service,\ntraditional practices must be challenged and replaced\nby new approaches\u201d. Multi disciplinary training should\nimpact on trainees\u2019 perception of professional roles.\nAt the end of training, trainees had not lost a sense\nof their own professional identity. Unfortunately,\nprofessional stereotyping was in evidence throughout\nthe training. Nurses, occupational therapists (OTs),\nsocial workers and others on the course were\nreasonably positive about one another on issues such\nas interpersonal skills, professional competence and life\nexperience. However, psychiatrists and psychologists,\nwho were not represented on the course, were rated\nas having less practical skill and life experiences and\nwere perceived as being poor team players.  \nLevel 2b: Acquisition of Knowledge and Skills\nAcquisition of Knowledge\nThirteen studies have examined the acquisition of\nknowledge following training in psychosocial\ninterventions. Five studies have been focussed on\ntraining in family intervention (Laube & Higson, 2000;\nKavanagh et al, 1993; Thomas et al, 1999; Leff &\nGamble, 1995 and Lancashire, 2003); six have looked\nat the impact of generic PSI training (Brooker et al,\n1996, Ewers, 2002; Willetts and Leff, 1997; Milne et\nal, 2000, 2002; Carpenter et al, 2003) and two\nexamined knowledge gain after specific skills\nprogrammes (Gray et al 2003; Brabban, 2003).\nTraining in Family Interventions\nShort \u2018In-house\u2019 Training\nThomas et al (1999) asked a multi-disciplinary group of\nstaff (n = 20) to complete a validated knowledge test\nbefore and after receiving 18 hours of training spread\nout across six teaching sessions. At the end of training\nsignificant increases in knowledge about helping\nResults\nchapter three\npage 23\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nfamilies with medication and helping families to\nmanage stress were reported compared to a control\ngroup who had not received tuition. Knowledge gain\nwas not found in all domains, however, no significant\nchanges were found in knowledge about family needs\nor of managing symptoms and problem behaviours. \nIn addition, no follow up was conducted at a later\nstage to determine whether knowledge was\nmaintained. In an Australian study, Kavanagh et al\n(1993) followed up practitioners who had completed\ntraining in family interventions six months to three\nyears previously and tested their knowledge. Although\nonly 4% had reported that their knowledge of\nbehavioural techniques was problematic, in a written\ntest most therapists did not display minimum recall of\nthe material on cognitive therapy, social skills training\nor behavioural strategies. Laube & Higson (2000) used\na personally developed questionnaire based on that\ndesigned by Kavanagh et al (1991) to measure\nknowledge acquisition at the end of a 27-hour training\npackage. They found some increase in knowledge but\nthis did not reach significance.\nUndergraduate Training\nLeff & Gamble (1995) asked four cohorts of mental\nhealth nurses who attended a nine month training\nprogramme in family interventions to complete a\nmultiple choice questionnaire testing factual\nknowledge about schizophrenia and family work. \nAll four groups showed a significant increase in\nknowledge in the first two months of training and this\nwas sustained up to the end of the course. In his\ncontrolled study, Lancashire (2003) incorporated\nLeff and Gamble\u2019s measure in a more comprehensive\nmultiple-choice questionnaire that was used to\nevaluate knowledge in trainees after 20 days of team\nbased family intervention training. Highly significant\nincreases were found across all domains tested\nincluding knowledge of schizophrenia and family\nintervention, theoretical principles of family\nintervention and application of therapeutic principles\nto case examples. The control group who did not\nreceive training showed no change in knowledge.\nGeneric PSI Training\nIn-house Training\nThree studies have examined changes in trainees\u2019\nknowledge following in-house training in psychosocial\ninterventions for psychosis. Results of a randomised\ncontrolled trial conducted by Ewers (2002) found that\nafter 20 days of training, forensic mental health nurses\nhad significant improvements in knowledge about\nschizophrenia and psychological approaches as\nmeasured by a 30 item multiple choice questionnaire\n(MCQ) when compared to a control group who did\nnot receive training. Willetts & Leff (1997) used an\nadapted version of the MCQ used by Leff & Gamble\n(1995) to measure knowledge gain in eight hostel\nstaff. The group who had received nine two-hour PSI\ntraining sessions delivered over ten weeks showed no\nsignificant changes in knowledge, however, this could\nbe attributable to the small sample size. Milne et al\n(2000) chose to use a case study format to assess\nknowledge gain in a group of 45 trainees who received\nan eight-day introductory training programme in PSI.\nAt the end of the course the scores for the group were\nsignificantly higher than at baseline.\nPostgraduate Training in PSI\nThe impact of postgraduate PSI training on knowledge\nhas also been evaluated (Milne et al, 2003 and\nCarpenter et al, 2003). Milne et al (2003) used the case\nstudy exercise referred to above to determine whether\nknowledge had improved in two cohorts of students.\nBoth cohorts scored significantly higher at the end of\ntheir first year compared to pre-training scores.\nThis suggests that the trainees were more likely to use\nappropriate theory to formulate an understanding of\nservice users\u2019 problems and to devise and evaluate\nappropriate interventions.\nCarpenter et al (2003) also found substantial increases\nin knowledge of psychosocial interventions in students\nwho attended a two-year postgraduate programme in\nCommunity Mental Health. Psychosocial interventions\nwere covered within the teaching. However, this was\nonly one element of a broad syllabus. At the end of\ntwo years, students\u2019 self-ratings indicated a substantial\nincrease of knowledge and skill in PSI from a relatively\nlow baseline. However, even after training, students\u2019\nscores reflected only a moderate level of competence\nand students\u2019 comments, included below, reflect that\nthey did not consider themselves trained as therapists.\n\u201cI\u2019ve certainly learnt a lot about CBT, but we are not\ntrying to be therapists: that takes years of training.\nIt\u2019s more a case of putting a name to what you have\nbeen doing already\u201d\n\u201cWe could have spent a lot longer on these modules.\nThe expectation was that we had three sessions and\nwere then an expert.  We could have spent less time\non other modules.  These were relevant to work.\u201d\nResults\nchapter three\npage 24\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nIndividual Interventions: CBT &\nMedication Management\nBrabban (2003) evaluated trainees\u2019 knowledge after\nbrief training in CBT of psychosis. She used an adapted\nversion of Milne\u2019s (2000) case-study assessment tool\nand found significantly higher scores in trainees after\nfive days of CBT training, thus, suggesting that they\nwere more able to apply cognitive therapy theory to\nformulate and devise an appropriate intervention.\nIt is unclear whether this impacted on their clinical\npractice as this was not evaluated at all.\nGray et al (2003) evaluated the knowledge gained by a\ngroup of community mental health nurses (n = 42)\nafter attending a ten-day training programme in\nmedication management. At pre-training baseline,\ntrainees showed a moderate level of knowledge and\nwere able to correctly answer approximately half of the\nquestions on the Knowledge of Medication Management\nQuestionnaire (KAMMQ). After training, significant\nimprovements in knowledge were observed with the\nnurses able to get around 75% of questions correct.\nAcquisition of Skill\nFamily Interventions\nThe development of skills has been evaluated most\nextensively in trainees who have undertaken generic\nPSI training, however, Brooker and Butterworth (1993)\nlooked at the competence of CPNs who undertook\ntraining in family intervention. Audiotapes of eight\nCPNs who had completed a six-month part-time\ntraining programme were rated post training. At two\nmonths, the CPNs were rated as competent in all nine\ndimensions of behavioural family therapy that were\nmeasured. Re-assessment of skills four months later\nshowed significant improvement in trainees\u2019 skills on\n\u2018assessment and review\u2019, \u2018feedback\u2019 and \u2018coping with\ntherapeutic difficulties\u2019. Although no pre-training\nbaseline measures were obtained the discernible\nimprovements during the training period itself\nwere encouraging.\nGeneric PSI Training\nIn-house Training\nIn a study in the North West region, Brooker et al,\n(1996) evaluated 67 practitioners from a variety of\ndisciplines who attended one of four, eight-day in-\nservice training programmes aimed at improving\nknowledge and skills to work with service users with a\nserious mental illness. Self -reports of \u201cpractical\nexperience of utilising skills\u201d were collected at the\nbeginning and at the end of the programme.\nSignificant improvements were found in the \u2018cognitive\nbehavioural management of stress\u2019. Mean scores also\nincreased on all other dimensions including the use of\nthe stress-vulnerability model, systematic quantified\nassessment, optimising the effects of medication and\npsychosocial family intervention techniques.\nHowever, none of these reached significance.\nBailey (2003) employed the same study design and\nmeasures as the Brooker et al (2003) study (see below)\nto evaluate whether trainees attending a validated\n20-day in-service training programme \u2013 the so-called\nThorn satellite programme - had acquired skills in\ncomponents of PSI. Twenty seven practitioners from\nthe Tameside and Glossop psychosis service who had\nreceived training some time between 1993 and 2002\ncompleted a questionnaire asking them to rate their\nperceived level of skill (currently and retrospectively,\npre-training) on a number of items related to practice\nin PSI. The group reported significant increases in\ntarget skills including conducting an assessment, CBT,\nfamily interventions plus interventions with a person\nwith a first episode of psychosis. Although these\nchanges were not as great as in the Brooker study,\nbaseline scores in Bailey\u2019s study were higher. It is likely\nthat trainees self-report in these two studies are\noptimistic although in both cases trainees\u2019 skills had\nbeen consolidated for at least 12 months following the\ntraining intervention.  \nIn order to assess skills pre and post in one of three,\neight-day in house PSI programmes Milne et al (2000)\nasked trainees (N = 30) to conduct a functional analysis\nof a client shown on a video clip. There was a significant\nshift in scores, indicating that learning had taken place.\nUndergraduate Training in PSI\nHaddock et al (1999) used the Cognitive Therapy\nChecklist (CTC) to rate audiotapes of trainees\u2019 clinical\nwork throughout nine months of Thorn PSI training at\nManchester University. These were compared with the\ntapes of a control group who were not in receipt of\ntraining. Fourteen out of 21 students submitted tapes\nbefore and after the course. Results showed significant\nimprovements in clinical skills compared with the\ncontrol group who were employed to do similar work.\nBlind, independent ratings on the CTC showed\nimprovements had been made in trainees\u2019 technical\nskills, general therapy skills and overall competence\nskills. Nevertheless, even with significant improvements\nin skill, trainees were still only demonstrating \u201cmodest\u201d\nabilities post training. \nResults\nchapter three\npage 25\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nPostgraduate Training in PSI\nTrainees who participated in the West Midlands two-\nyear postgraduate programme in Community Mental\nHealth were asked to rate their level of competence in\nvarious aspects of PSI before training, after one year\nand also at the end of their second year (Carpenter et\nal 2003). Students clearly reported an increase in\ncompetence at the end of the programme compared\nto the start of the course - however, they were clear\nthat they had not been trained to a level of competence\nof a skilled CBT of family interventions practitioner.\nRepper (2000) in her evaluation of the two-year\nundergraduate PSI programme in Sheffield also\ncommented on the level of competence in CBT at\nthe end of training:\nIn the present study, clients were visited with the same\nfrequency but, apart from three clients, received only\nweak and unsustained cognitive interventions (n=2),\nor none at all (n=14)\nAlthough they were taught the theory of cognitive\nbehavioural therapy on the course students only\nimplemented \u2018lower level\u2019 cognitive skills\u2026they very\nrarely demonstrated the analytical and formulation\nskills necessary to \u2018correct a person\u2019s misperceptions,\nirrational beliefs and reasoning biases related to \ntarget symptoms \u2013 techniques that Jones\net al (1997) use as criteria to define a\ncognitive behavioural intervention.\nOverall however, Repper found that trainees gained\nconfidence and increased their range of skills.\nBrooker et al (2003) also evaluated skills from the same\nprogramme in their follow-up study of practitioners\nwho had completed either London Thorn Training or\nPSI training at the University of Sheffield. Ninety-six\nrespondents rated their pre-training and current level\nof skill on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 equivalent to\ntotally skilled). Results showed a significant increase in\nall rated items (see Table 3 below) showing that skills\nhad been maintained over time. The perceived\nmoderate to high level of skill reported by trainees in\nthis study is seemingly inconsistent with the findings\nof Repper (2000) above. One possible explanation for\nthis apparent contradiction might be that Repper\u2019s\nsmall sample consisted of students actually in receipt\nof training whilst Brooker et al\u2019s larger sample had\ncompleted training for at least one year.\nFig. 3 Key PSI skills learned on Birmingham Two-year Community Mental Health programme\n(Carpenter et al, 2003)\nCBT\nEssentials of CBT & developing a conceptual\nframework\nUnderstanding compliance therapy\nCoping strategies\nMonitoring side effects\nSocratic Questioning\nStructuring sessions\nFamily Interventions\nBasics of Behavioural Family Therapy\nStructuring sessions\nHow to carry out a session\nEngaging families in problem solving techniques\nEnhancing skills through role play\nUsing the approach flexibly\nImportance of practice\nTranscultural aspects of the approach\nResults\nchapter three\npage 26\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nSpecific Training\nTraining in Medication Management\nGray et al (2003) report on a group of 52 nurses who\nreceived a ten-day training package in medication\nmanagement over a ten-week period. The training\nfocussed on assessment, cognitive and compliance\ntherapy skills, psychopharmacology and clinical\nsupervision. Clinical skills were measured pre and post\ntraining using the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS) as\nused by Haddock et al (1999). Before training, the\ngroup showed \u2018barely adequate\u2019 to \u2018mediocre skills\u2019,\nwith most competence being demonstrated in\n\u2018interpersonal effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018collaboration\u2019.\nPost-training, the nurses showed significant\nimprovements, with at least half of the group able to\ndemonstrate \u201csatisfactory skills\u201d on each of the items\nmeasured on the CTS, where \u2018satisfactory\u2019 was defined\nas scoring 50% (30) or more on the scale (mean =\n31.12, s.d. = 5.75). A stepwise linear regression was\nused to identify factors that predicted trainees\u2019 skill\nfollowing training and included variables such as\ncaseload size, experience, clinical grade, highest\nacademic qualification and attendance. Baseline scores\non the CTS accounted for 67% of the variance and\nhighest academic qualification, grade and attendance\naccounted for a further 29%.  \n3.4.3. Level 3 Outcomes: Change in Behaviour\nKirkpatrick identified \u2018Change in Behaviour\u2019 as the third\nlevel of outcome: this focuses specifically on\nbehavioural change in the workplace as a result of\nchanges in attitudes and acquisition of skills and\nknowledge that have occurred through training. \nBehaviour change as a result of training in PSI has been\nstudied extensively. For the purposes of the review,\nstudies have been subdivided by focus of training.\nFamily Interventions Training\nFadden (1997) followed up 86 practitioners who had\nbeen trained in family interventions to determine\nwhether they were able to implement what they had\nlearnt. Training had consisted of 39 hours of training\n(including a three day training course and group\nsupervision) followed up by an ongoing monthly\nsupervision group. Of the 59 responses she received,\n70% reported that they had been able to use\nBehavioural Family Therapy (BFT) techniques in their\nwork since completing their training. However,\non average, each therapist had only seen 1.7 families\nsince the completion of training which ranged from\nnine months to three and a half years earlier. The\nnumber of families seen by those who had trained\nbetween 1.5 to 3.5 years prior to being questioned\nranged from none to six. When questioned about\ndifficulties they had experienced attempting to\nimplement the approach, 31% of respondents said\nthey had been unable to find suitable families to work\nwith, 25% complained that the approach was too\ntime-consuming or required out of hours working and\n17% said they had difficulty engaging families or found\nfamilies unwilling to co-operate. Difficulties involving\nlack of confidence on behalf of the therapist or\nproblems with supervision were seldom reported.\nThe setting in which staff worked had a significant\nimpact on the difficulties encountered. Community\nstaff saw significantly more families and reported fewer\ndifficulties than in-patient staff. Fadden also reported\nTable 3: Influence of PSI Training on Skills (Brooker et al, 2003)\nSkill Mean Score Difference in\nBefore After Mean\nBuilding relationships with service users with serious  6.3 8.6 +2.3\nmental health problems \nConducting a relevant assessment 4.5 8.8 +4.3\nCognitive behavioural therapy 3.2 7.5 +4.3\nUndertaking family interventions 2.8 7.4 +4.6\nPsychological management of symptoms 3.6 8.0 +4.4\nInterventions with first episode psychosis 3.3 7.7 +4.4\nResults\nchapter three\npage 27\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nthat a crucial factor determining whether BFT was\nimplemented or not was the number of staff trained in\none particular area. Significantly more families were\nseen in teams or units where eight or more staff had\nbeen trained in BFT.\nThe findings reported in the Fadden study, are\nconsistent with the results of the Australian follow-up\nstudy carried out by Kavanagh et al (1993). In this\nstudy 45 practitioners were followed up six months to\nthree years after completing training in cognitive\nbehavioural family interventions. The training was \n30-35 hours in duration, usually in five full days or ten\nhalf-day sessions. At follow up 69% of participants\nreported delivering three or more sessions of the\nintervention, however, each had only seen an average\nof only 1.4 families and only 18% of the sample had\nseen three or more families. The low rate of application\nwas most frequently ascribed to time and caseload\nconstraints placed on them at work and from their\noutside interests and responsibilities. However, unlike\nthe Fadden study, the extent of knowledge predicted\nthe extent to which family work was implemented\nalthough it was unclear whether the level of\nknowledge contributed to low involvement with\nfamilies or was a result of it, Kavanagh et al note:\n\u201cA substantial familiarity with the material is required\nbefore a therapist can apply it to the complex and\nsevere problems that occur with schizophrenia\u2026\nWithout a full integration of the material into the\ntherapists\u2019 conceptual framework, the intervention is\nlikely to become a slavish application of a rigid\nprogram rather than a flexible adaptation to the\nspecific issues and skill requirements of the family.\nThe reported difficulties with tailoring of material in \nthe current study suggest that this may have \noccurred in some cases.\u201d\nA regional training scheme was introduced into the\nWest Midlands to improve the implementation of\nfamily interventions across the patch - large numbers\nof staff from 17 Trusts were trained in Behavioural\nFamily Therapy (BFT). A cohort of potential trainers\nwere trained in BFT (cohort 1), this group then trained\na second cohort who then became trainers for a third\ncohort and so on. Campbell (1999) estimated that 18\nmonths after the first cohort had been trained, at least\n900 families had received BFT from approximately 505\ntrained staff. Trainees, however, reported problems in\nimplementing the approach (see Tables 4 and 5\nbelow). Fourteen percent of the first three cohorts\nreported that it was either \u2018extremely difficult or\nimpossible\u2019 to implement BFT.\nTable 4: Rating and ranking of difficulty experienced in implementing family intervention\nStudy Mean Rating (and Ranking out of 31 items) in each area of difficulty \nimplementing family intervention\nAllowance of Time Integration with Availability of\nfrom service to do Caseload or other appropriate families\nintervention responsibilities at work\nBuckingham, UK 1.56 (4) 1.76 (2) 2.18 (1)\n(Fadden, 1997)\nManchester, UK 3.05 (1) 2.95 (2) Not available (Reported\n(Baguley et al., 2002) as a difficulty by 20% \nof sample)\nSomerset, UK 1.6 (1) 1.53 (2) 1.20 (8)\n(Bailey, 2003)\nSydney, Australia 2.3(2) 2.4 (1) 1.9 (3)\n(Kavanagh et al., 1993)\nWest Midlands, UK 2.10 (2) 2.43 (1) 1.92 (3)\n(Campbell, 1999)\nResults\nchapter three\npage 28\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nWhen trainees did see families they reported that the\nmost common reasons for non-engagement in BFT was\nto do with families themselves, including the family or\nservice user not wanting to participate.\nBaguley et al (2000) used the same questionnaire\nadopted in the previous studies to determine the level\nof implementation of family interventions amongst the\nfirst two cohorts of students from the Manchester\nThorn Programme. In the time since completing\ntraining (between 6 and 18 months) there was a wide\nvariation in the number of families who had been seen\n- from none to more than five (mean = 2.5). Table 4\nillustrates that in three out of five of these studies\n\u2018allowance of time\u2019 and \u2018integration with caseload or\nother responsibilities at work\u2019 were ranked as the two\ngreatest factors obstructing implementation of family\ninterventions.\nA team training approach to family intervention has\nbeen introduced in Somerset. Eighteen practitioners\nfrom the Family Support Service attended a one-year\ntraining programme that taught an integrated \ncognitive-systemic approach to family interventions.\nBailey et al (2003) evaluated trainees\u2019 implementation\nof family work up to three years post training. A mean\nof 3.5 families had been seen per trainee in an average\nof 26 months since completing training. However,\nunlike other studies that have examined implementation\nof family interventions, 80% of the trainees in the\nSomerset study rated the overall level of difficulty in\nimplementing family intervention as \u201cnot at all or a\nlittle difficult\u201d (see table 5). Bailey et al concluded that\na number of factors appeared to facilitate the\nimplementation of family interventions in their service;\nin particular, the flexible nature of the family service,\nthe multi-disciplinary nature of the teams and the use\nof co-working and supervision.  They also believed that\nthe provision of an effective service was linked with\nhaving a critical mass of staff trained in family\ninterventions. Nevertheless, when problems were\nencountered, there was consistency between this study\nand the others in reporting primary barriers to\nimplementation (See Table 4).\nTable 5: Overall level of difficulty reported implementing family interventions in five Studies \nStudy Difficulty Rating\nNot at all or a little Moderately or Extremely Difficult\ndifficult Very Difficult or impossible\nBuckingham, UK 44% 45% 11%\n(Fadden, 1997)\nManchester, UK 20% 55% 35%\n(Baguley et al., 2002) \nSomerset, UK 80% 20% 0%\n(Bailey, 2003)\nSydney, Australia 31% 48% 22%\n(Kavanagh et al., 1993)\nWest Midlands, UK 36% 50% 14%\n(Campbell, 1999)\nResults\nchapter three\npage 29\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nLancashire (2003) also addressed the issue of having a\ncritical number of staff trained in family interventions\nby using a team-training approach. Nineteen staff\ncompleted 20 days training in Family interventions.\nIn the six months prior to training no-one in the\nexperimental or control group had carried out evidence\nbased family intervention. Six months post training, the\n14 community based practitioners had seen a mean of\n3.6 patients each (range 0 to 6) which Lancashire saw\nas a good outcome for practitioners with an average\ncaseload of 20; the control group provided no family\ninterventions in the same time period.\nBrooker and Butterworth (1993) looked at changes in\nworking practice of CPNs who had received training in\nfamily interventions - there was no significant change\nin either caseload size or the proportion of service\nusers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. A significant\nincrease in the proportion of the working week spent\nwith families was, however, reported, increasing from\n15% of the week pre-training to 45% at one year\nfollow up (p<0.001).\nIn a controlled study that looked at the impact of a\nshort in-service training programme in Family\nInterventions, Thomas et al (1999) found that\npractitioners who had received training, when working\nwith families were discussing topics such as managing\nmedication and symptoms, emotional support and\nstress management, significantly more than they had\nbeen at baseline and more than the control group.\nHowever, no significant differences were found\nbetween the experimental and control groups on the\nfrequency of initiated or actual contact with families.\nGeneric PSI Training\nBrooker et al (2003) followed-up practitioners who had\nreceived undergraduate PSI training on either the\nInstitute of Psychiatry Thorn programme or the\npostgraduate MSc PSI training course in Sheffield.\nThe whole sample reported that PSI training had\ninfluenced a number of areas of practice including:\nconfidence to deal the clients with serious mental\nhealth problems, use of a structured approach with the\nclient group and recognition of the importance of\nappropriate involvement of families. In terms of their\nwork with families, on average each practitioner had\nseen one family for at least one session each year since\ntraining, though the range was wide. Further analysis\nwas carried out on the data by creating two groups\n(those who had seen a greater number of families\ncompared to those who had seen fewer) to determine\nwhether any factors were related to successful\nimplementation of family work. Some differences\nbetween the groups emerged with those who had\nundertaken the greater amount family work:\n\u0002 More likely to be Thorn trainees (as opposed \nto Sheffield)\n\u0002 Reported having a greater percentage of clinical\ntime to use PSI\n\u0002 Had significantly greater length of service in\nmental health\n\u0002 Reported higher current skill in undertaking\nfamily interventions\n\u0002 Reported significantly higher current level of\nmotivation to implement PSI\n\u0002 Reported significantly lower difficulty in ability \nto implement PSI across a range of potential\nbarriers (particularly relating to family work and\ntime pressures)\nOverall, when ranking the barriers to PSI\nimplementation, the study showed that both\npractitioners and their managers saw \u2018integration with\ncaseload or other responsibilities\u2019 as the main problem,\nwith \u2018time to undertake interventions\u2019, and \u2018access to\nsupervision\u2019 as being problematic. When practitioners\u2019\nmanagers were asked an open question on what they\nperceived the main barriers to be, caseload size was\nranked as the greatest barrier, followed by lack of\nunderstanding on the part of others about what was\ninvolved, insufficient staff trained in PSI and the lack of\nan organisational plan.\nFig 4: Significant Improvements in Practice Following\nGeneric PSI Training as Reported by Brooker et al\n(2003) and Bailey (2003)\n\u2022 Level of confidence in dealing with clients with\nserious Mental Health problems.\n\u2022 Recognition of the importance of appropriate\ninvolvement of families.\n\u2022 Recognition of the needs of carers\n\u2022 Use of a structured approach with the client group\nBailey (2003) used the same self-report measures as\nBrooker et al (2003) to evaluate a well established\nand validated 20-day in service training programme in\nPSI (the so-called Thorn Satellite programme).\nTwenty-seven staff from a rehabilitation team, inpatient\nservices, a high dependency unit and a day hospital\nresponded to the survey. Though respondents reported\nsignificant improvements in all assessed areas of their\nResults\nchapter three\npage 30\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\npractice (see Figure 4 above), they did not perceive\ntheir level of change to be as great as in the Brooker\nstudy, however, pre-training baseline scores were\nhigher in the Bailey study.\nWhen asked to rate barriers affecting implementation\nof PSI, there was a high level of agreement in the rank\nordering between the Brooker et al and Bailey study.\nHowever, access to consultation and supervision was\nrated much less of an issue by practitioners in the\nTameside and Glossop psychosis service (Bailey, 2003)\nwho ranked it 13th compared to ex-trainees in the\nBrooker et al study who rated this as the 3rd greatest\nbarrier to implementation.\nThe service evaluation of the COPE initiative at\nManchester University, carried out on behalf of the local\nWorkforce Development Confederation (Teamwork,\n2001) examined obstacles to implementing PSI and\nfound \u2018lack of time within the service\u2019, \u2018caseload size\u2019\nand \u2018availability of supervision\u2019 were reported as the\nthree key barriers. Notwithstanding these problems,\nover 70% of the trainees in the survey responded that\nthey used some of their training either all of the time or\nsome of the time, and 63% claimed that they now used\nwhat they had learnt more than they had when they\nfirst graduated. Assessment skills, the stress-vulnerability\nmodel, family intervention skills and CBT for individuals\nwere seen as the most useful aspects of the training in\nterms of use in everyday practice.\nGray et al (2001) were interested in whether Thorn\ntraining influenced clinical practice post training.\nThey surveyed 240 community mental health nurses\nand asked about their use of standardised assessment\ntools. They found a significant difference in practice\nbetween those staff that had received Thorn training\nand those that had not. Thorn graduates reported\nusing significantly more assessment tools to measure\nneuroleptic side effects and general psychopathology\nthan those who had not undergone PSI training.\nAfter completing a short in-service training programme\nMilne (2000) found that 19 of the trainees were using\naspects of their training with a total of 173 clients\n(mean = 9.1; SD = 7.9). Post training, trainees were\nfound to be making significantly more use of a number\nof assessment tools and treatment techniques that had\nbeen covered in the training. A number of \u2018boosters\u2019\nwere identified as helping the transfer of training into\npractice including contact with other trainees, contact\nwith PSI supporters, and a supervision group. At an\norganisational level, the PSI steering group within the\nTrust was also acknowledged as being beneficial.\nSimilar results were found from a larger study that\nfollowed up trainees from 10 Trusts who had received\nin-service training provided by Sheffield University up\nto three years previously (Milne et al, 2000).\nTrainees from seven of the ten trusts replied with an\noverall response rate of 53% (n = 155). Responses to a\nstaff questionnaire suggested that there had been a\nsignificant increase in the use of PSI methods following\ntraining with trainees using their newly acquired skills\nwith a mean of 12.6 service users. These methods\nincluded the use of standardised assessment,\nformulation, and symptom management.\nTrainees rated contact with other course members as\nthe most helpful type of support with PSI\nimplementation, supervision was ranked second. Milne\net al also asked trainees\u2019 managers (n=7) to comment\non what they saw as their own supportive role within\nPSI Implementation. Managers ranked \u2018maintaining a\nshared vision\u2019 and \u2018developing others\u2019 as their priorities\nand saw institutional constraints, especially insufficient\nresources, as the main barrier to implementation.\nMilne et al (2000) used a case note audit to determine\nwhether training was in fact being transferred to\npractice in 16 members of staff (15 nurses and an\noccupational therapist) who had participated in an\neight day in-service training programme. Using a\npre-training double baseline as a control, Milne found\na significant increase in the use of assessment\ninstruments after the training had taken place and this\nwas still present though weakened at six month follow\nup. As the author himself comments, the lower number\nof instruments used at six months could have been\nrelated to opportunities for use, since many of the tools\nwould only be administered every 6 or 12 months.\nThe use of PSI in three cohorts of students before and\nafter post-graduate training on the West Midlands\nCommunity Mental Health Programme has also been\nevaluated (Carpenter et al, 2003). Results varied\nbetween groups, though overall, students reported a\nsignificant increase in the frequency of using CBT and\nFamily Intervention after the first year. This trend\ncontinued into the second year, with some students\nincreasing their use of CBT and family interventions.\nThe rise throughout was moderate, however, and\nstarted from a fairly low baseline. An overall increase in\nthe frequency of assessment and care planning was also\nfound between the end of the first and second year.\nWhen asked about the barriers to implementation\nstudents perceived \u2018time and resources\u2019 as the most\nsignificant factor. Though not rated as highly, low self\nconfidence in PSI skills and a lack of supervision was\nalso commented upon as a hindrance and students\nonce again pointed out that the programme only\nResults\nchapter three\npage 31\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nserved as an introduction to CBT and family\ninterventions - it did not equip them to act as therapists.\nSimilar methods were used to assess students\u2019\nimplementation of skills after receiving postgraduate PSI\ntraining at Sunderland University (Milne et al, 2003).\nSignificant increases in the use of CBT were found at\nthe end of year one and two but a similar result was\nnot found with family interventions. Significant\nincreases in the use of standardised assessments and\ntreatment techniques were also found.\nOnly Kapur (2002) did not find any differences in\npractice in staff one year after they had received\n\u2018advanced training in PSI\u2019 (18 days) when compared to\na control group who had been given access to basic\nPSI training. There were significant problems with\nattrition in this study however, with 7 of the 11 staff in\nthe experimental group (64%) leaving the residential\ncare unit where the research was being conducted\nduring the follow-up period.\n3.4.4. Level 4 Outcomes: Benefits to Service Users\nand Carers\nService User Outcomes\nTen studies have evaluated whether training in\npsychosocial interventions has benefited service users\n(see Table 6). These can be further sub-divided to the\nspecific focus of training: family intervention, CBT or\ngeneric PSI training.\nTraining in Family Interventions\nOf the four studies that focussed on outcomes for\nservice users after training in family interventions, three\nfound significant benefits (Brooker et al, 1992, 1994;\nMiklowitz; 2000), whilst Laube and Higson (2000)\nfound that implementing family interventions post\ntraining had no significant effect. In the two studies by\nBrooker and colleagues, trainees received 20 days of\naccredited undergraduate training prior to\nimplementing the family interventions. In the 1992\nstudy, that followed-up service users 12 months post\ntreatment, a significant reduction in both positive and\nnegative symptoms was found as well as an\nimprovement in social functioning. In the later study\n(Brooker et al, 1994), significant improvements in social\nadjustment were also reported for service users, in\naddition, their families reported an improvement in\ntheir personal functioning.\nMiklowitz\u2019s (2000) study differed in that training was\nfocussed on helping service users with a bi-polar\naffective disorder, plus the training was undertaken\nin-house. Practitioners followed a practice manual in\naddition to watching video taped examples and\nreceiving supervision. After receiving the intervention\nservice users showed a significant reduction in relapse\nrates, particularly depressive episodes, compared to the\ncontrol group.\nCBT\nTurkington et al (2002) carried out an RCT to\ndetermine whether trainees who had received 10 days\nof \u2018Insight Training\u2019 (a cognitive behavioural based\nintervention), could improve outcomes for service\nusers. \u2018Insight Nurses\u2019 were specifically employed to\nundertake the training and implement the intervention\nthereafter, thereby removing many of the barriers to\nimplementation found in earlier studies. Six trainees\nsaw 225 service users in six different sites. Post\ntreatment, significant improvements were found in\noverall symptoms, depression and reported levels of\ninsight. No significant improvements were found in\nsymptoms of schizophrenia or in carer burden.\nFarhall and Cotton (2002) report some significant\nimprovement in symptoms. In an uncontrolled study,\nclinical psychologists were provided with two days of\ntraining in Coping Strategy Enhancement and given\naccess to regular supervision. Service users receiving\nthe intervention reported a significant reduction in the\nfrequency of symptoms, and were less distressed and\npreoccupied with these. In addition a significant\nimprovement in global functioning was found.\nGeneric PSI Training\nKapur (2002) looked at outcomes for service users who\nhad key workers with advanced PSI training (18 days)\nand compared these with those whose key workers\nhad only had access to basic PSI training. No difference\nwas found at up to 12 months follow up. However,\nwithin the experimental group, 7 of the 11 staff with\nadvanced training left the unit and the study during\nthe trial, and 50% of the service users in this group\nhad a change of key worker up to three times in the\n12 month post training follow up period.\nTwo studies looked at outcomes for service users who\nreceived interventions from trainees who participated\nin Manchester Thorn training (Lancashire et al, 1997;\nLancashire, in submission). Both studies found a\nsignificant reduction in symptoms post treatment as\nwell as improvements in social functioning, however,\nthere was no control group to compare results with a\ngroup receiving treatment as usual.\nRepper (2000), in her study of the Sheffield University\npost graduate PSI programme, found that most clients\nwere helped to achieve their personal goals and almost\nhalf (9\/19) showed a reliable change in symptoms.\nResults\nchapter three\npage 32\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nAuthor Year of N Focus of Type of Research \npublication (pre&post) Training Training Design\nBrooker, C. et al 1992 19 Family Work 20 days (U\/G) CBA\nBrooker, C. et al 1994 30 Family Work 20 days (U\/G) CBA\nCarpenter, J. et al 2003 70 Generic PSI 2 year Postgraduate CBA\nWest Midlands\nFarhall, J & Cotton, S. 2002 15 CBT In-Service training for UCBA\nAustralian \npsychologists (2 days\n& clinical supervision)\nGray, R et al 2003 29 Medication 10 days RCT\nManagement\nKapur, S 2002 6 Generic PSI In Service Training CBA\n(Intro course + 18\nfurther days:\nover 5 months)\nLancashire, S. et al 1997 27 Generic PSI Manchester Thorn UCBA\n(U\/G)\nLancashire, S. et al In submission 120 Generic PSI Manchester Thorn UCBA\n(U\/G)\nLaube, R.E. & Higson, F. 2000 37 Family Work In-Service UCBA\nMilne, D. et al 2002 23 Generic PSI 2 year Postgraduate UCBA\nSunderland University\nMiklowitz, D.J. et al 2000 28 Family Work Manual Based RCT\nIn-service\nRepper, J. 2000 Single case study Generic PSI Sheffield  Single Case\ndesigns Postgraduate Repeated\nPSI Programme Measures\nTurkington, D. et al 2002 225 CBT Manual Based  RCT\n10 day\nTraining Programme\n(Insight Training)\nTable 6: Outcome Studies for Service Users\nResults\nchapter three\npage 33\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nMeasures Key Results\nKGV; SFS; GHQ; KASI; Significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms and social functioning at 12 month \nConsumer Perceptions of follow up\nServices Questionnaire\nKGV; Diary of contact; Significant improvements in social adjustment and relatives\u2019 assessment of service user\nSocial Adjustment Scale; personal functioning\nPersonal Functioning Inventory\nLQoL, HoNOS; GAF; BPRS; Significant fewer symptoms, improved life skills, higher GAF scores, Lower HoNOS score.\nLife Skills Profile;\nUser Defined Questionnaire\nReferral Information and Significant improvement on a number of symptom dimensions: frequency, distress and \nBaseline Observations preoccupation.

Post treatment,\nservice users reported a number of significant\nimprovements; the frequency of symptoms reduced as\ndid scores on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale\n(HoNOS). Overall, trainees rated service users as having\nimproved global functioning, better social skills and an\nincrease in the quality of life. These results compared\nfavourably with a group of service users who received\nthe standard Care Programme Approach in an area\nwhere trainees had not received this specific training -\nfor this group there were no significant changes on\nany of the measures used.\nOutcomes for Carers\nOut of the 39 studies that have evaluated PSI related\ntraining, only four have looked at outcomes for carers \n(see Table 3). Three controlled studies (Brooker et al,\n1992(a); 1992(b) &1994) looked at the outcomes for\ncarers who had received family interventions from\ntrainees who had undergone 20 days of undergraduate\ntraining in family work. Compared to the control\ngroup, the carers who received the intervention\nshowed significant improvements in mental health\nstatus, knowledge about schizophrenia and in their\nlevel of satisfaction with the service they had received.\nIn a later study, Leff et al (2001) found that carers who\nreceived a full family intervention from trainees who\nhad completed an in-service training programme,\nshowed a significant reduction in Expressed Emotion\ncompared to a control group who received only two\nsessions of education about schizophrenia. Although a\nhigh level of expressed emotion is known to be a strong\npredictor of relapse, no difference in relapse rates was\nfound between the two groups after 12 months.\nAuthor Year Focus Type Number Research Measures Key Results\nOf Of Of Of Experimen- Design\nPublication Training Training tal Families\/\nCarers (Pre\nand Post)\nBrooker, C. 1992 Family 20 day 17 CBA Knowledge  Experimental group \net al (27) Interventions under About showed significant \ngraduate Schizophrenia improvements in \nInventory (KASI) knowledge about \nschizophrenia.

Studies illustrate that\ntrainees were consistently satisfied with the training\nthey received (see section 3.4.1). Although only two\nstudies specifically evaluated the supervision\nassociated with postgraduate training, results were\nnot so positive. For example, in sharp contrast to the\nreaction towards specialist supervision provided by the\ntrainers, the majority of trainees in the Milne et al\n(2003) study did not believe the routine supervision\nthey received from their employing Trust met their\nneeds.\nEvidence: \nConsistent results were found in all eight studies that\nevaluated trainee satisfaction with training: two of\nthese were controlled and six uncontrolled. A number\nof rating scales were used to measure trainee\nsatisfaction therefore it is impossible to compare\nresults directly. In two in-depth, independent external\nevaluations, Carpenter et al (2003) and Milne et al\n(2003) specifically assessed satisfaction with\nsupervision associated with postgraduate training.   \nAttitudes and Beliefs:\nBecause of the fundamental values base within\nPSI training it is not surprising that nine studies,\njust under a quarter of the total sample, evaluated\nchanges in attitudes and beliefs. On the whole,\nit would appear that PSI training in all its forms has\na positive effect on the attitudes and beliefs that\ntrainees hold about psychotic conditions (particularly\nbeliefs about cause and therapeutic optimism), about\nservice users with a psychosis and regarding available\npsychosocial interventions to help service users \nand carers.\nEvidence: \nOf the nine studies looking at attitude change, only\ntwo used the same assessment tool (Leff and Gamble,\n[1995]; Lancashire [2003]) making it impossible to\nmake general comparisons between studies.\nHowever, a number of studies compared trainee\nattitudes pre and post training, three of which were\ncontrolled. Significant improvements were reported\nat the end of training (Brabban, 2003; Ewers, 2002;\nLancashire, 2003; Leff & Gamble, 1995; Thomas\net al, 1999).\nAcquisitions of Kowledge:\nStudies that evaluated knowledge gain, tended to\nfind that specific elements of trainees\u2019 knowledge\nhad improved when tested immediately post training,\nirrespective of the length or type of training they had\nreceived. Based on the results of the Kavanagh et al\n(1993) study it is less clear how long newly acquired\nknowledge is retained and what factors preserve\nlearning.\nEvidence:\nThirteen of the studies included in the review looked\nat knowledge gain as a result of PSI training (see\nsection 3.4.2), four of these were controlled trials\n(Lancashire, 2003; Thomas et al, 1999) two of which\nwere randomised (Ewers, 2002; Gray et al, 2003).\nAt the end of training, which ranged from 18 hours\nto two years, only two studies failed to find a\nsignificant increase in knowledge (Laube and Higson,\n2000; Willetts and Leff, 1997). However, both of\nthese studies had small sample sizes which could\nhave contributed to the non-significant results.\nOnly Kavanagh et al (1993), however, followed up\ntrainees some time later, post-training. They found that\nrecall of certain topics including CBT and behavioural\nstrategies to be minimal. This was despite only 4% of\ntrainees reporting they had a problem with knowledge.\nA variety of measures were used to determine level of\nknowledge within the 13 studies making it impossible\nto make cross study comparisons of trainees\u2019\nknowledge either pre or post training.\nSummary\nchapter four\npage 36\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nAcquisition of Skill: \nOn the whole trainees developed targeted skills when\nattending PSI training in all forms. However, because\nof the variety of methods used to rate skill\ndevelopment within the research and the frequent use\nof self report, it is difficult to determine exactly what\nlevel of expertise is reached in each study and thereby\nascertain what type of training is required (length and\ntype) to teach skills to different levels. Haddock et al\n(1999) and Gray et al, (2003) both used the CTS, a\nvalidated measure of CBT skills to determine skill level\npre and post training. Although both studies showed\nthat trainees had acquired significant skills, their\nactual level of skill post-training as rated by the CTS\nwas moderate in relation to possible achievable\nscores. Only one study addressed specific trainee\nvariables in an examination of which individual factors\ncontribute to the greatest skill acquisition. Gray et al,\n(2003), found that clinical skills pre-training, academic\nqualifications and attendance were significant factors. \nEvidence\nSkill development has been evaluated most\nextensively within generic PSI training, however, only\ntwo studies (Haddock et al, 1999; Gray et al, 2003),\nboth controlled,  used a validated measure to\nmeasure this. Brooker and Butterworth (1993) rated\naudiotapes of trainees\u2019 clinical work to determine\nskills acquisition and four studies relied on self report\n(Brooker et al, 1996; 2003; Repper, 2000; Bailey\net al, 2003).\nChange in Behaviour (Implementation): \nMost of the studies that relate to implementation are\nhigh quality cross-sectional surveys achieving a high\nresponse (see section 3.3.1). There is greatest\nconsistency in the research methods reported where\nthe implementation of PSI training has been\nevaluated. For example, five studies have used the\nsame instrument to evaluate the difficulty of\nimplementing family interventions in routine clinical\npractice (see Table 4, page 27). Common barriers to\nimplementation of family work include: allowance of\ntime in the service; integration with existing caseload\nand the availability of families. In addition, common\n\u2018boosters\u2019 to implementation have been consistently\nreported in all related studies: a critical number of\nstaff trained in the team; access to high quality\nsupervision; having the time to do the work and\npossessing enough skill to apply the intervention\nflexibly. Several studies point to the importance of\norganisational ownership of the implementation of\nPSI through Steering Groups constituted with senior\nmanager involvement. \nEvidence: \nImplementation of family intervention training: \nA number of well-designed cross sectional studies,\nachieving a high response, have reported similar\nbarriers to the implementation of family interventions\ntraining (Kavanagh et al, 1993; Fadden, 1997;\nCampbell, 1999; Baguley et al, 2002; Bailey, 2003)\nImplementation of PSI Training: A number of high\nquality cross-sectional studies have shown that there\nare identifiable factors that can facilitate the\nimplementation of PSI training: team training (Bailey,\n2003; Lancashire, 2003); access to appropriate\nsupervision (Brooker et al, 2003; Bailey, 2003;\nTeamwork, 2001) and organisational ownership and\nsupport (Brooker et al, 2003; Milne, 2000 and\nCarpenter et al, 2003). \nBenefits to Service Users and Carers: \nBenefits to service users and carers have been found\nin the majority of relevant studies. There are three\ntimes as many studies reporting outcomes for service\nusers (n=12) compared to carers (n=4). The service\nuser studies are of variable quality with just seven out\nof twelve employing controlled designs.\nImprovements in service users\u2019 symptoms were\nreported in six out of seven controlled studies.\nThe one study where symptoms did not improve was\nunderpowered and suffered from serious problems\nwith attrition (Kapur, 2002). Social and general\nfunctioning improved in seven of the nine studies\nwhere it was measured but only three of these studies\nwere controlled.  \nOnly four studies have examined outcomes for carers.\nThree of these studies relate to the same 20-day\ntraining for family intervention reported by Brooker\nand colleagues (Brooker, 1992a; 1992b; 1994). In the\nother paper, Leff et al (2001), the impact of training\nin family intervention on family environment was\nexamined. There are too few studies measuring\ndiverse outcomes to draw any meaningful\nconclusions. It is clear that more research is needed\nthat examines the impact of PSI training from the\nrelative\u2019s perspective.  \nSummary\nchapter four\npage 37\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nWhether outcomes focus on service users or carers it\nis difficult to extricate the essential ingredients of a\nsuccessful training programme as it would seem that\nmost findings seem to occur independently of either\nthe length or type of training.\nEvidence: \nImprovement in service users\u2019 symptoms: In the vast\nmajority of the controlled studies service users\u2019\nsymptoms improve at variable follow-up periods\nfollowing PSI training (Brooker et al, [1992; 1994];\nCarpenter et al, 2003; Gray et al, 2003; Miklowitz et\nal, 2000; Turkington et al, 2002).  \nImprovement in service users\u2019 social functioning:\nIt is possible that after PSI training service user\u2019s social\nfunctioning improves but the evidence is not strong\n(Brooker et al, [1992; 1994]; Carpenter et al, 2003;\nFarhall and Cotton, 2002; Lancashire et al, 1997;\nLancashire et al [in submission]; Milne et al, 2002). \nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 38\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n5 Discussion  \n\u0001\nIntroduction\nThis review has identified a surprisingly large number\nof studies - 37 in total - which have attempted to\nevaluate PSI training for work with people with a\npsychosis. Throughout this review, in our attempts to\noutline this literature we have been keen to stress two\nkey points. First, that the term \u2018psychosocial\ninterventions\u2019 is a ubiquitous one. For example, in this\nreview we have identified a randomised controlled trial\nthat has evaluated 10 days of training in cognitive\nbehavioural skills (Turkington et al, 2002) that aimed\nto reduce symptoms and promote \u2018insight\u2019 which\nmight be contrasted with a follow-up study of PSI\ntrainees attending a much longer two year part-time\nMasters programme (Brooker et al, 2003).\nSecond, that despite the policy imperatives and the\nrhetoric relatively few mental health professionals have\naccessed any type or level of PSI training of any kind.  \nThe scope of evaluated PSI programmes\nThe review has confirmed that there are a wide variety\nof evaluated PSI courses. However, they can be\nclassified into three main course types, i.e. those that\nare accredited by Higher Education at either the\nundergraduate or postgraduate level and shorter\nprogrammes that often run \u2018in-house\u2019 within mental\nhealth services themselves. Similarly, the focus of PSI \nprogrammes also falls into three main groups:\nfamily intervention, individual psychological\ninterventions or broader generic courses (that can\ninclude both family interventions and individual\npsychological interventions). Clearly, there is a need to\navoid possible confusion for non-specialist groups,\nsuch as educational commissioners, who might wish\nto commission evidence-based PSI programmes but\nwho are understandably confused by the variety of PSI\ncourse focus and type. It is useful to consider the\ndistribution of studies in this review in relation to the\nnine cells described above (and summarised in Table\n1). It is clear that it is generic courses across all levels\nthat have been evaluated most either through tenders\nlet by the commissioners of programmes themselves\n(see for example, Milne et al, 2003; Teamwork\nManagement Services, 2001 and Carpenter et al,\n2003) or by students undertaking research as part\nof their course work (Ewers, 2002; Bailey, 2003).\nHowever, given the number of generic programmes\nnow in existence the number of evaluations is\nsomewhat small with properly funded external\nevaluations yet smaller still. A number of family\nintervention programmes have been evaluated;\nthese are either in-house programmes or offered at\nundergraduate level. However, within this sub-group\nthe studies are most often cross-sectional (Fadden,\n1997; Kavanagh et al, 1993; Campbell, 1999; Bailey,\n2000 and Baguley, 2000) where researchers are\ngrappling with the question of what happens to\ntrainees in real-life clinical settings after training has\ntaken place. Only one series of papers has considered\nthe impact of such family work training using a\ncontrolled design (Brooker et al, 1992a; Brooker,\n1992b; Brooker, 1993 and Brooker, 1994). Finally a\nnumber of short in-house programmes for individual\npsychological interventions have been evaluated,\nfor example, CBT to promote insight (Turkington et al, \n2003); CBT for psychosis (Farhall & Cotton, 2002), a\nshort in-house CBT programme for psychosis (Brabban,\n2003) and medication management skills (Gray, 2003).\nIt is interesting that although training in psychosocial\ninterventions is a relative new comer to the mental\nhealth arena, PSI training appears to have been\nextensively evaluated proportionate to the overall\nnumber of post-qualifying training programmes (Bailey\net al, 2003). In the Bailey et al review of evaluated\npost qualifying mental health training programmes,\nPSI training was subsumed under the broader\nheading of psychological therapies for all mental\nhealth problems. Twenty nine papers looking at\ntraining in psychological therapies were identified,\nhowever, two thirds of these (n = 19) were actually\nPSI\/psychosis focussed. \nchapter5\nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 39\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nThe methodological quality of the\nincluded studies\nThe 37 included studies utilise one of three main\nmethodological approaches: the cross-sectional design\n(or survey); the uncontrolled trial (often just before\nand after but some studies have a limited follow-up)\nor the controlled trial (again with variable lengths of\nfollow-up). Further details are given of research design\nin Appendices 3-5. It is important to comment on the\nquality of the included studies as the criteria for\ninclusion have been framed primarily to determine the\nextent of evaluated PSI studies and no study has been\nexcluded on the basis of the quality of its design.\nIn a series of articles in the British Medical Journal\n(Education Group for Guidelines on Evaluation [1999];\nHutchinson [1999]; Wilkes and Bligh [1999] and\nCantillon and Jones [1999]) an important debate is\npresented about ways in which to address quality\ncriteria for studies that evaluate educational initiatives\nwith a health focus. The four papers wrestle with the\nimportance of educational research being as rigorous\nas other types of research both in its design and\nexecution, however, a series of arguments are then\nraised about why this is very hard to achieve.\nUltimately this discussion centres on the feasibility\n(and desirability) of the conduct of randomised\ncontrolled trials. The complex nature of education is\nproblematic with a number of factors impacting upon\nultimate outcomes: \nEducational events are multifaceted interactions\noccurring in a changing world and involving the most\ncomplex of subjects. Many factors can influence \nthe effectiveness of educational interventions\u2019\n(Hutchinson, 1999)\nThe Education Group for Guidelines (1999),\nfor example, acknowledge that \u2018purposeful sampling\nmay be more informative than attempts at\nrandomisation and controls, which are difficult to\nachieve in adult education\u2019. Finally, Hutchinson (1999)\nstates that there is a \u2018fundamental difficulty in\naddressing the question everyone wants answered -\nwhat works in what context, with which group and at\nwhat cost?\u2019 She argues that achieving this, in the\neducational context, is as problematic as \u2018\u2026\u2026.in the\nevaluation of a complex treatment performed on a\nsample group of people who each have different\nneeds, circumstances and personalities\u2019. However, if\nthe gold standard, the RCT, is difficult to achieve in\neducational research, that is not to say that other\nalternative methods employed should not be\nundertaken to a high quality. Thus for example, in this\nreview, to achieve high quality, and to avoid response\nbias, it might be anticipated that the cross-sectional\nsurveys outlined in Appendix 4 would achieve a\nresponse rate of 70-80% and use measures that had\nbeen field-tested and that seemed to possess validity. \nThe great majority of cross-sectional studies in this\nreview do achieve both criteria although there are\nseveral exceptions (Teamwork Management Services,\n2001; Campbell, 1999). Nevertheless, studies with low\nresponse rates should not be overlooked, since a low\nresponse rate in itself may be highlighting potential\nproblems within the system in which the training takes\nplace that should be addressed. Appendices 4 and 5\noutline the comparison studies where there are 25 in\ntotal and half of these (n=13) are controlled and a\nfurther 12 uncontrolled. Every one of the 12\nuncontrolled studies examines trainee outcomes,\nusually knowledge and attitudes, in most cases\nin a simple before and after training design.\nLargely, the findings are positive ones but the lack of\nlong-term follow-up is problematic especially where\nchanges in skills are measured. Although skills often\nimprove (see for example, Haddock et al 1999) rarely\ndo trainees acquire the highest level of competence as\noutlined in Figure 1. Half of the uncontrolled studies\nfocus on outcomes for service users where it is\nassumed, for example, that changes in trainees\u2019\npractice leads to better clinical outcomes for service\nusers, such as frequency and severity of symptoms.\nThis is an ambitious claim, given that these studies are\nuncontrolled but also that service users drop out of\nthe study and are often not available for measurement\npost-training. A good example of this tendency is the\nevaluation of Thorn training by Lancashire and\ncolleagues where only 120\/256 service users are\nreported at follow-up. Similarly, Milne et al (2003) in\nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 40\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\ntheir study of the Sunderland PSI Masters programme\nonly obtained post-training ratings on 23\/54\nservice users.  \nThe fourteen controlled study designs include six\nrandomised controlled trials (Gray et al, 2001*; \nGray et al, 2003*; Ewers et al, 2001; Leff et al, 2001;\nTurkington et al, 2003* and Miklowitz et al, 2000) an\nasterisk marks those studies, only three, where a\npower calculation was included to estimate sample\nsize. Two studies had small groups in two comparison\ngroups and are unlikely to have been sufficiently\npowered (Ewers et al, 2001; Leff et al, 2001). \nThe remaining studies used a matched comparison\ngroup (often care as usual) or a within-subjects design\nwith delayed intervention. Outcomes are assessed for\nservice users in seven of the twelve studies. Usually the\noutcome employed is a measure of symptom\nfrequency or severity in all six studies symptoms\nimprove significantly apart from the study by\nTurkington et al (2003) where the symptoms of\nschizophrenia did not improve (although \u2018overall\nsymptoms\u2019 did). Outcomes for carers are assessed in\nfour of the studies. In two studies by Brooker (1992a;\n1993, 1994) the minor psychiatric morbidity of\nrelatives reduces significantly and knowledge about\nschizophrenia also improves (1993). In the study\nreported by Turkington and colleagues (2003) the\nburden of care does not improve. Five of the studies\nmeasure trainee outcomes - trainee\u2019s knowledge\nabout schizophrenia significantly improves in three of\nthese (for example see Ewers et al, 2001). In the study\nby Kapur (2002) a matched control design, there are\nserious problems with group sizes and attrition. \nHere, staff were trained to use PSI with 14 service\nusers using Alternative Futures nursing homes in the\nNorth West, this group were then matched with 14\nservice users in other Alternative Futures nursing\nhomes where staff were not trained. A total of 11\nservice users (11\/28: eight in the experimental group\nand three in the controls) did not consent, absconded\nor left during the study. A dropout rate of 39% must\nraise serious concerns about the validity of any of\nthe findings.\nThus, in a total of 37 included studies, 11 are cross-\nsectional studies of a reasonable quality and 12 are\nuncontrolled studies where the interpretation of\nfindings might be more problematic (a caveat here is\nthat some of the uncontrolled studies include\nsignificant amounts of qualitative data that help to\nsupport some of the findings [see for example,\nCarpenter et al, 2003]). Finally, 14 of the studies are\ncontrolled and six of these are randomised controlled\ntrials. By way of comparison, Cantillon and Jones\n(1999) report the findings of a systematic review of\ncontinuing medical education and a comparison is\npresented in Figure 5 of the design of studies included\nin both reviews.\nFigure 5: A comparison of study design in two systematic reviews of educational Interventions (Cantillon\nand Jones, 1999 [CME] and Brooker and Brabban, 2004 [PSI])  \nCantillon and Jones (1999) Brooker and Brabban (2004)\nN % N %\nBefore and after 28 41.0 12 32.0\nControlled 15 22.0 8 22.0\nRCTs 16 23.0 6 16.0\nOther 10* 14.0 11** 30.0\nTotal No of Included  69 100.0 37 100.00\nPapers\n* \u2018Exit only\u2019 and qualitative\n** Cross-sectional and includes some qualitative\nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 41\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nThe table shows that even for a systematic review of \na large and important area like Continuing Medical\nEducation there is a very similar proportion of\ncontrolled trials, RCTs and simple before and after\ndesigns when compared to the much smaller field of\nPSI \u2013 a growing but nonetheless small educational\nsubset of mental health.  If it is the case, as seems\nlikely, that all educational intervention studies will\nstruggle to obtain research funding then this,\ncorrespondingly, will have an impact on the quality of\nthe research designs that such studies employ.\nThus, this seemingly harsh commentary on the design\nof PSI evaluated training should be tempered with the\nknowledge that at least half of all the studies, \non which this review are based, are of a high quality\nand this compares well with reviews of medical\ncontinuing education which arguably will encounter\nless resistance from research funding bodies.\nThe implications for commissioning PSI\nprogrammes\nThe number of PSI programmes, commissioned by the\nNHS, has grown dramatically over the past ten years\n(Brooker, 2002), and, as we have shown, policy\nexhortations make it likely that the trend will continue.\nIt is therefore useful to consider the implications of\nthis review for the commissioning of programmes. \nAny commissioning process will wish to take into\naccount, probably at the Strategic Health\nAuthority\/Workforce Development Confederation level,\nthe plans each mental health provider has for training\nthe workforce in PSI skills. Ideally, this will be on the\nbasis of a local agreement of the numbers of staff that\nneed to be trained at each of the levels outlined in\nFigure 1. This is an exercise that has been undertaken\nin a number of patches in the UK already (see for\nexample, NIMHE (2004) - West Yorkshire; Repper and\nBrooker, (2002) \u2013 19 Trusts in the former Northern\/\nYorkshire area). It is likely that mental health providers\nwill want all mental health professionals trained to at\nleast an introductory level often on courses run in-\nhouse (Bailey et al, 2003), a smaller number on longer\nundergraduate programmes with finally a small\nminority trained to expert level  - a group that became\nthe organisation\u2019s major supervisory resource. So what\noutcomes are likely to result from an investment in\nPSI training?\nTrainees\u2019 Reaction\nThe results section of this review demonstrates that\nthe vast majority of trainees are satisfied with the\ntraining they receive, although there is evidence from\nAustralia that not all mental health professionals\nengage with the prevailing cognitive-behavioural\nparadigm that underpins most training programmes\n(Kavanagh et al, 1993). For this reason, those teaching\nlonger PSI programmes should endeavour to ascertain\ntrainees\u2019 views about the cause and most effective\ntreatment of serious mental illnesses before\nprogrammes begin. \nKnowledge, Attitudes and Beliefs\nGenerally, PSI training in all its different guises has a\npositive effect on attitudes and beliefs. One of the\nmost common themes that emerge in this domain is\nthe much more positive and hopeful attitudes that\ntrainees have towards people with a diagnosis of\nschizophrenia and their carers (Repper, 2000; Brooker\net al, 2003). This change in attitude is much more\nlikely to lead to the adoption of a \u2018recovery\u2019 model\nof serious mental health problems. Not only will PSI\ntraining improve attitudes but also the acquisition of\nnew knowledge is highly probable too. This is\nirrespective of the type or focus of training. What this\nreview makes clearer, however, is that the length of\ntime such knowledge is maintained is more\nquestionable as there have been no studies examining\nlonger-term knowledge gain say for lengthy follow-up\nperiod of 12-24 months.    \nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 42\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nThe Acquisition of Skills\nDo trainees acquire clinical skills as a consequence of\nattending PSI training courses? The review would\nsuggest that clinical skills are improved but there are\nseveral caveats to this statement. First, several different\ntools have been utilised to assess the acquisition of\n(for example, the Behavioural Family Therapy Skills\nMeasure [Brooker et al, 1994]; Cognitive Therapy\nchecklist [Haddock et al, 1999]) it is therefore\nproblematic to assess the level of skills that have been\nacquired. Other studies have attempted to determine\nskills acquisition through self-report (Brooker et al,\n2003; Bailey, 2003) a method that is likely to threaten\nthe reliability and validity of such estimates. Finally,\nthere are very few evaluated Master\u2019s level\nprogrammes for individual psychological therapies, \nin other words, we have no reliable \u2018benchmark\u2019\nfor the highest level of \u2018expert skills\u2019 acquisition.\nAll these factors combine to make it difficult,\ntherefore, to reach any general conclusions about the\ntype and length of training that is required to achieve\nany specific level of expertise. Careful work is required\nacross the PSI training menu to articulate the specific\ncapabilities that are required to meet the requirements\nof knowledge, attitudes and skills for the Types A, B\nand C outlined in Figure 1. \nImplications for the Implementation of\nPSI\nIn a recent paper that reported on an intensive\nproject, funded to address the organisational issues\noften associated with the implementation of research-\nbased care and treatment of people with a psychosis,\nRepper and Brooker (2002) commented:\n\u2018A number of studies have shown that whilst PSI\ntraining has been available in the UK for a decade, \nit can be far from straightforward to ensure that\nprogrammeme graduates implement skills they have\nbeen taught in routine service settings\u2019 (page 3)\nUsing Kirkpatrick\u2019s framework we report in some detail\non this literature on pages 14-42 of this report.\nThe majority of the studies report on family\nintervention in psychosis where it is clear that there\nare different training models that lead to variable\nlevels of success (as defined by number of families\nengaged over a finite post-training period) in real life\nclinical settings. Most programmes that have followed-\nup students, who have attended training programmes\nas individual representatives from services or teams,\nexperience greater problems than courses where a\nwhole team of individuals has been trained from the\nsame service (Bailey, 2003; Lancashire, 2003). That is\nnot to say, however, that some individually trained\npractitioners are not successful in engaging families.\nBrooker et al (2003) have shown that having protected\n\u2018PSI\u2018 time, a high level of motivation and greater\nfamily work skill all contribute significantly as well.\nIt is also likely that having access to local skilled\nsupervision is of critical importance. In a service in\nGreater Manchester, which has run a local accredited\nintroductory course for PSI for a number of years, the\nlack of access to skilled supervision was not ranked\nhighly as a barrier to implementation (Bailey, 2003)\nunlike a larger national study where it was considered\none of the greatest problems (Brooker et al, 2003).\nRepper and Brooker (2002) examined 19 trusts in one\npatch in the North of England and found that the\nnumber of expert PSI supervisors varied from 0 to 10. \nWhy might team training and access to supervision\nand supportive colleagues be important? \nRepper (2000) has used a useful theoretical framework\nto examine why access to supervision and supportive\ncolleagues might be important in PSI training. \nShe cites Lipsky (1980) in his examination of the public\nsector in the USA.  Lipsky was particularly interested in\nthe critical part played by employees in governing the\ngeneral public\u2019s access to public services. In his\nconsideration of training and the role it played in\nincreasing service quality and controlling the output of\nfront line workers, Lipsky commented:\nWorker training is less important than the nature of\nworking conditions themselves. Without a supportive\nnetwork of working peer relationships, training to\nimprove the service capacity of workers is likely to\nwashout under the pressure of the work context\u2019\nOne other key area of difficulty associated with the\nimplementation of PSI has been one of the availability\nof resources. Studies consistently report on the time\nrequired to undertake interventions not being available\nand the problems of integrating PSI with existing\ncaseload responsibilities (for example see Fadden,\n1997; Kavanagh et al, 1993; Baguley et al, 2002).\nInterestingly, however, a subset of all respondents in\nthese studies ranging from 20-80% report only a little\ndifficulty with the issue of resources (see Table 5).\nClearly caseload size is a critical issue. Repper and\nBrooker (2002) found that average caseload size varied\nfrom 15-48 for individual practitioners in CMHTs\nDiscussion\nchapter five\npage 43\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nacross 19 Trusts.  Indeed, with the relatively recent\narrival of functional teams, such as assertive outreach\nand early intervention, the movement of PSI\npractitioners from CMHTs to newer teams has been\ndescribed (Brooker et al, 2003). One reason for this is\nlikely to be the smaller caseloads on offer within these\nnewer services that clearly offer greater opportunity\nfor more intensive PSI-related casework. \nClearly, the implementation of PSI in routine clinical\nsettings can be problematic. A number of key factors\nare likely to interact. Courses need to provide\npractitioners with the confidence to use new skills and\npractitioners then need to be supported with skilled\nsupervision. It is crucial that other team members and\nmanagers are supportive of PSI approaches.  High\ncaseloads are likely to make the implementation of PSI\nunfeasible. If these key issues are addressed by\norganisations then successful implementation is likely\nto result.\nconclusion\nConclusion\nchapter six\npage 44\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\nThis scoping review has identified 37 studies that meet\na priori criteria for the evaluation of PSI training. \nIt is clear that PSI is a ubiquitous term that covers a\nrange of interventions for work with people with a\npsychosis. A range of methodological approaches was\nused in the research but no quality criteria were\nadopted to determine inclusion. It is difficult to draw\nmeaningful conclusions from some of the uncontrolled\nstudies but the RCTs and cross-sectional studies have\nbeen well conducted. Kirkpatrick\u2019s typology of\neducational outcomes was used to structure both the\nreporting of the results and the discussion. PSI training\nis universally well received by trainees, improves\nknowledge and generally has a positive effect on\ntrainee\u2019s attitudes to serious mental illness.\nStudies have shown too that trainees\u2019 skills improve\nbut establishing the level of expertise that is attained is\nproblematic as we have no operational benchmarks\nfor differing levels of skill. These are optimistic\noutcomes for commissioners to consider, however, \nit is equally important to address the implementation\nissues if PSI training is to have any meaningful impact.\n6 Conclusion  \n\u0001\nRecommendations\nchapter seven\npage 45\nNational Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n7 Recommendations  \n\u0001\nrecommend\nResearch and evaluation of PSI programmes\n\u0002 The national PSI implementation group within NIMHE\nshould create a national forum for all PSI training\nproviders in order to agree consistent methods and\nmeasures to audit outcomes and quality of training.\n(This has recently been undertaken by the group)\n\u0002 Research money is required in order to develop reliable\nvalidated measures of all PSI skills.\n\u0002 More follow-up studies should be conducted to\ndetermine the extent to which trainees\u2019 knowledge,\nattitudes and skills are maintained over time.\n\u0002 More controlled studies are required to measure the\nimpact of PSI training, particularly from the service\nuser and family perspective. \n\u0002 To date there has been a paucity of research\nconsidering outcomes of training for families and\ncarers. More work is required in this area.\n\u0002 Secondary analysis of the studies included in this\nreview should be undertaken in an attempt to\nexamine the relationship between factors such as\nthe quality of the research, the type of training,\nand outcomes for service users.\nCommissioning of PSI programmes\n\u0002 Commissioners and training providers should use\nthe typology of skill types outlined on page 15 to\nnegotiate the likely outcome for trainees from\neach programme.\n\u0002 In line with the findings from this review,\ncommissioners and Trusts should be mindful that\nupon completion of PSI training practitioners may not\nhave the skills to implement complex formulation\ndriven therapies (level 3 skills) and may require\nadditional experience, supervision and\/ or training\nto acquire this level of skill.\n\u0002 The National PSI Implementation Group should review\nthe content of current PSI training programmes and\nrecommend a core-curriculum for courses taught at\ndifferent levels. This should reflect the evidence and\nvalues base, national policy and guidelines including\ntopics such as Cultural Competency, Recovery Based\nPractice and Risk Management.\n\u0002 Discussions should take place between local\nstakeholders to determine local training needs prior\nto the commissioning process. This should include\ncommissioners, training providers and Trusts. A good\nexample of this is illustrated within the South Yorkshire\nPSI Implementation Strategy Document (Brooker and\nLinde, 2002).\n\u0002 Commissioners and Trusts should consider putting in\nplace mechanisms to address the complex issues\nrelated to implementation in different service areas.\nFrom the evidence base it would be expected that\ndifferent functional teams will have distinct issues to\naddress in relation to implementation. For example\nEarly Intervention teams with small caseloads, a clear\nfocus, and a PSI philosophy should find it easier to\ntranslate theory into practice than a Community\nMental Health Team with larger caseloads, a diverse\nclient group and competing demands.\nOver the coming months the National PSI Implementation\nGroup will be addressing potential implications of this\nreview for commissioners. However, it is evident that\ncommissioners will need consider a number of issues\nincluding the following:\n\u2022 Should individuals or teams be trained?\n\u2022 What \u2018level\u2019 of PSI training is required by whom?\n\u2022 Is post-training expert supervision available within the\nstudent\u2019s organisation?   \n\u2022 Is there support for the training at the highest\norganisational level? \n\u2022 Are sufficient resources available to students to\nundertake the intervention once they have completed\ntraining (e.g. caseload size, access to assessment\nmaterials)\nReferences\npage 46 National Institute for Mental Health in England\nMeasured Success\n(For list of included studies see Appendix 7)\nReferences \n\u0001\nB\nBailey, D., Carpenter, J., &  Rogers, H.
