However, the unique four-spacecraft \ntetrahedral configuration of the Cluster spacecraft shows that this is not a valid scenario \nas the cavity passed over the four spacecraft, travelling continuously equatorwards and \nEarthwards.  We present data from the Fluxgate Magnetometer, Cluster Ion \nSpectrometer, Plasma Electron and Current Experiment, and Research with Adaptive \nParticle Imaging Detectors instruments on board the Cluster spacecraft.    \n \n1. Introduction \n The plasma sheet in the near-Earth tail is a region of closed field lines located in \nthe equatorial region of the magnetotail.  It is composed of the central plasma sheet and \nthe plasma sheet boundary layer, which interfaces with the open field line of the tail \nlobes.   \n During summer 2002 the orbits of the Cluster spacecraft were optimized for data \ncollection in the Earth's magnetotail, passing at regular intervals from the northern lobe, \nthrough the plasma sheet, and into the southern lobe.  Their separation while in the \nmagnetotail was consistently around 4,000 km.  The tetrahedral formation of the \nspacecraft allows full temporal and spatial analysis of the data that are collected, \nrevealing far more information than from a single spacecraft describing a similar orbit. \n \n2. Instruments \n The instruments used in this study are from the Cluster spacecraft: the Fluxgate \nMagnetometer (FGM; Balogh et al., 1997), the Cluster Ion Spectrometer (CIS; R\u00e8me et \nal., 1997, composed of the time-of-flight ion Composition and Distribution Function \nanalyser (CODIF) and Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) instruments), the Plasma Electron and \nCurrent Experiment (PEACE; Johnstone et al., 1997), and the Research with Adaptive \nParticle Imaging Detectors (RAPID; Wilken et al., 1997, from which the Imaging \nElectron Spectrometer (IES) instrument is used). \n Data from the Tartu (Tar) station of the IMAGE ground magnetometer network \n(Viljanen and H\u00e4kkinen, 1997) are also presented.  This station is located at 58.26\u00b0 \ngeographic latitude and 26.46\u00b0 geographic longitude. \n \n3. Data and Observations \n Figure 1 shows the location of the Cluster spacecraft at 1900 UT on 1 September \n2002 in the X-Z and X-Y planes in geocentric solar magnetospheric (GSM) coordinates.  \nThe relative locations of the spacecraft to each other are also shown on the right of each \npanel.  Cluster 1 (Rumba) is blue, Cluster 2 (Salsa) is green, Cluster 3 (Samba) is yellow, \nand Cluster 4 (Tango) is red.  The dotted lines depict model magnetic field lines using the \nTsyganenko 1996 model (Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996).  The spacecraft are located ~17 \nRE downtail in the post-midnight sector, close to but northward of the equatorial plane.  \nCluster 3 is closest to the equatorial plane, with Cluster 4 furthest downtail and Cluster 2 \nclosest to midnight.   \n Data from the Tartu station of the IMAGE magnetometer network (top two panels \nof Figure 2) indicate that at ~1900 UT the magnetosphere was in the recovery phase \nfollowing a substorm that occurred at 1823 UT, detected as a decrease in the X \ncomponent and evidence for Pi2 activity at onset.  Much later, at 2305 UT, a second \nsubstorm was also detected. \n Particle data from the Cluster instruments for 1800 to 2400 UT, also shown in \nFigure 2, indicate that during this interval the Cluster spacecraft were initially located in \nthe lobe, passing through the plasma sheet boundary layer into the plasma sheet starting \nat 1903 UT.  The CIS instrument on Cluster 4 (third and fourth panels of Figure 2) \ndetects a sudden increase in ion density from ~0.01 cm-3 in the lobe to ~1 cm-3 in the \nplasma sheet, accompanied by velocity bursts to ~1,000 km s-1 in the Vx component \n(parallel to the magnetic field), which is typical of plasma sheet boundary layer beams.  \nThe PEACE and RAPID instruments on Cluster 4 also detect corresponding increases in \nthe low- and high-energy electron fluxes, respectively.  At the time of the second \nsubstorm, 2305 UT, the Cluster spacecraft re-entered the lobe due to the dipolarisation of \nthe magnetotail at substorm expansion phase onset.  For a more detailed analysis of these \ntwo substorms, see Draper et al. (2004). \n Data from the FGM instruments on all four Cluster spacecraft for the interval \n1900 - 1920 UT are shown in Figure 3.  Around 1911 UT all components of the magnetic \nfield decreased to close to zero nT, occurring in the order Cluster 4, Cluster 1, Cluster 2, \nand finally Cluster 3.  Analysis of the spacecraft orientations relative to each other \nindicates that the field cavity was travelling Earthward, from dawn to dusk, and towards \nthe equator (down on to the spacecraft).  The magnetic field then recovered to a value of \n16 nT (significantly less than the 29 nT detected before the magnetic field cavity) in the \nsame order: 4,1,2,3.  This indicates that the cavity passed completely over the spacecraft.  \nThe time taken for this was around 20 s; given the Cluster spacecraft separation of ~4,000 \nkm indicates a velocity of the order of ~200 km s-1.  The scale size of the cavity is similar \nto that of the Cluster tetrahedron.   \n The CODIF and HIA data from the CIS instrument on Cluster 1 are shown for the \ninterval 1900 - 1920 UT in Figure 4, with Cluster FGM data for comparison.  The plasma \nsheet boundary layer beams are clearly seen as increased velocities (panel 3, CODIF and \npanel 5, HIA), high energy densities (panel 4, CODIF and panel 7, HIA) and increased \ntemperature (panel 6, HIA).  However, at ~1911 UT corresponding to the field cavity the \nvelocities decreased to close to zero.  This coincided with a high isotropic temperature \n(~5 keV) and enhanced energy density in the 1 to 10 keV energy range, detected at both \nthe CODIF and HIA instruments.   \n Figure 5 shows distribution functions (Vparallel against Vperpendicular) from the HIA \ninstrument on Cluster 1 from 1904 to 1916 UT.  The plasma sheet boundary layer beams \nwere clearly seen from 1904 UT as enhanced fluxes in the +Vparallel direction (towards \nEarth), with flux spread about zero Vperpendicular.  From 1909 UT (before the magnetic \ncavity is detected by the FGM instrument) the distribution filled in in the -Vparallel \ndirection, from high pitch angles towards low, becoming gradually more isotropic.  By \n1911 UT the distribution was isotropic with very slow velocities, and looked like a \ntypical central plasma sheet distribution.  The distribution then returned to plasma sheet \nboundary layer beams, with evidence for mirrored particles, as flux was detected in the -\nVparallel direction.  From 1915 UT the spacecraft entered the central plasma sheet, \ndetecting an isotropic distribution function.  A similar series of distribution functions was \ndetected by the Cluster 3 HIA instrument (data not shown), delayed by ~40 s with respect \nto Cluster 1.  This is as expected, since Cluster 3 was the last of the four spacecraft to be \npassed over by the cavity. \n \n4. Discussion \n The Cluster spacecraft detected a magnetic cavity at 1911 UT on 1 September \n2002 when crossing from the northern lobe of the magnetotail into the plasma sheet \nduring the recovery phase of a magnetospheric substorm.  This cavity was clearly \nembedded within the plasma sheet boundary layer, and associated with the plasma sheet \nboundary layer crossing.  It was moving Earthwards, from dawn to dusk and equatorward \nover the spacecraft, travelling at ~200 km s-1, and was filled with hot, dense, isotropic, \nlow velocity plasma.  Its characteristics were similar to that of the central plasma sheet.  \nHowever, the FGM data from the four separate Cluster spacecraft indicate that this cavity \ncould not have been the central plasma sheet as it was clearly associated with the plasma \nsheet boundary layer, and not travelling in a direction indicative of the central plasma \nsheet expanding and contracting over the spacecraft.   \n Further study of this unusual plasma sheet boundary layer magnetic cavity is \nrequired to accurately determine its characteristics and origin.  This is not a solitary \nevent; another similar cavity is detected later on the same day, also during the recovery \nphase of a magnetospheric substorm.  Further potential magnetic cavity candidates have \nalso been identified for inclusion in a statistical survey of these interesting new structures. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigures \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \nFigure 3 \n \n \n \nFigure 4 \n \nFigure 5 \n \nReferences \nBalogh, A., Dunlop, M.W., Cowley, S.W.H. et al., The Cluster magnetic fields \n investigation.
