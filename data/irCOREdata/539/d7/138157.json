True BAFs, as defined by \nStephenson (1997), contain a granular medium that provides a large surface area per \nunit volume for biofilm development. The medium also allows the reactors to act as \ndeep, submerged filters and incorporate suspended solids removal. As a fixed-film \nprocess, optimal conditions for the relevant micro-organisms can be maintained \nindependently of hydraulic retention times. The process has therefore achieved high \nlevels of nitrification, denitrification and phosphate uptake (Goncalve & Rogalla, \n1992). \n  \nThe selection of a suitable BAF medium is critical in the design and operation of the \nprocess, to enable the required effluent standards to be reached. Superior substrate \nremoval has been shown by BAFs containing mineral media, such as expanded clay, \ncompared to those using sand or plastic media with similar dimensions (Moore et al., \n1999a). The size of a BAF medium also has a strong influence on process \nperformance. Consequently, different sized media have been recommended for \ndifferent applications (Mendoza-Espinosa & Stephenson, 1999). A medium larger \nthan 6 mm may be preferable for a roughing stage BAF prior to full secondary \ntreatment. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that a tertiary treatment BAF should use \na medium smaller than 3 mm. The intermediate size range of 3 to 6 mm has been \ndesignated suitable for secondary treatment BAFs. However, within this mid-range, \nmedia with different mean hydraulic sizes will infer different operational constraints \non the BAF process. \n4 \nThe performances of pilot-scale downflow BAFs, using four size ranges of the \nmineral medium Lytag, have been compared (Smith et al., 1999). All except one of \nthe samples of Lytag had a mean hydraulic size between 3 and 6 mm and so would \nhave been considered suitable for a secondary treatment BAF. The results indicated \nthat generally, for a given reactor to produce a particular effluent quality, media size \ndictates the maximum loading rate. The explanation is that a smaller medium offers a \ngreater surface area per unit volume for biofilm development, and so minimises the \nrequired reactor volume.  \n \nUsing three variants of a vitrified clay medium with mean particle sizes between 2.8 \nand 4.4 mm, it was found that decreasing the size of a BAF medium increased its \nbackwashing requirements (Stensel et al., 1988). This would have a negative effect on \nthe reactor\u2019s operating costs and productivity. The backwashing procedure in a BAF \nis normally initiated when a limiting head loss has developed, as a result of deposited \nsolids reducing the filter porosity. \n \nThus, previous work indicates that decreasing BAF media size improves the reactor\u2019s \nsubstrate removal performance but increases its backwashing requirements. However, \nthe mechanisms which cause these changes remain unclear. In this study, to achieve a \nbetter understanding of the influences of media size, the performance of two size \nranges of foamed clay have been analysed in terms of substrate removal, suspended \nsolids removal kinetics, and maximum run times. \n \n5 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nTwo identical PVC reactors were built, with a diameter of 0.2 m. This diameter was \nselected because wall effects are limited if a filter\u2019s diameter is more than fifty times \nthe mean particle size. If the wall effects were significant, there would be a greater \nvariance in head loss build up (Lang et al., 1993). The reactors had a downflow \nconfiguration, a height of 3.15 m and contained 0.3 m of gravel beneath 2 m of media. \nMoore et al. (1999a) gives full details of reactor set up and start-up procedure. The \noperating flow rates (Q) with corresponding hydraulic retention time (HRT), \nhydraulic loading rate (HLR) and organic loading rates are summarised in Table 1.  \n \nOne reactor contained the cylindrical foamed clay StarLight C, with particle diameters \nranging between 1.5 and 3.5 mm. Details of the characteristics of this medium and \nprevious performance results can be found in Moore et al. (1999b). The other reactor \nused a larger StarLight C with particle diameters ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 mm. Since \nthe cylinders were up to three times longer than they were wide, it was assumed both \nwould be categorised as suitable for secondary treatment BAFs. The two media have \nsimilar physical properties in terms of acid solubility, dirt content and attrition levels. \nThe larger version has an estimated sunken density of 1650 kg m-3 compared with \n1500 kg m-3 for the smaller medium, and a packed voidage of 45% rather than 40%. \nHowever, since their estimated experimental minimum fluidisation velocities were \nsimilar, both media were backwashed with a liquid velocity of 45 m h-1. Prior to \noperation, tracer studies were conducted on the BAF containing the larger medium, \nfollowing the methods, conditions and analysis used previously for the smaller \nmedium (Moore et al., 1999b). The results are shown in Table 2.  \n6 \nDuring the 76 days of operation, influent and effluent samples were taken regularly \nand the concentrations of suspended solids (SS), soluble and total chemical oxygen \ndemand (sCOD and tCOD) and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3) were analysed using \nstandard methods (APHA, 1992). Portable probes were used to measure the \ntemperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Ports, at intervals of 0.2 m \nfrom the base of the columns, allowed samples to be drawn at specific intervals so \nthat substrate removal profiles could be examined. The BAFs were backwashed every \n24 hours using the procedure reported previously (Moore et al., 1999a). Generally, \nsamples were drawn at the end of the filter run, but occasionally, samples were also \ntaken immediately after backwashing to examine the recovery of effluent quality. \n \nPressure transducers were attached to the BAFs and the pressure build up above the \nfilter beds was recorded using a data logger. At each flow rate the reactors were left \nwithout backwashing for up to 72 hours to find the maximum run time before filter \nblockage. \n \n  \n \n \n7 \nRESULTS \n \nStart-up was rapid for both BAFs and steady SS removal was shown after just three \ndays (Figure 1). For the smaller medium reactor, mean SS removal was over 89% for \nthe whole period (Table 3). This performance was consistent following backwashing \nand increases in the flow rate (Q), and only fell below 80% on day 69 (Figure 1) \nimmediately after the flow rate was increased to 0.6 l min-1.  \n \nBy contrast, the effluent from the larger medium reactor had less consistent levels of \nsolids. Although the effluent SS concentrations were generally below 20 mg l-1 at all \nflow rates, there were seven peaks above 25 mg l-1, and the effluent contained over 30 \nmg l-1 of SS on days 16, 48, 53 and 76. Most of these troughs can be explained, since \nthe effluents were sampled immediately after backwashing on days 9, 16, 33, 40, 48, \n53, 61 and 69. The larger medium exhibited reduced SS removal after backwashing \nand the recovery time appeared to depend on the flow rate (Figure 2). At 0.3 l min-1 \nthe effluent recovered within 10 minutes whereas at 0.4 l min-1, recovery took over 30 \nminutes. \n \nBoth reactors reached stable sCOD removal on the third day of operation (Figure 3) \nand subsequently achieved an overall mean of approximately 70% removal with flow \nrates between 0.3 and 0.6 l min-1 (Table 3). The mean percentages of sBOD in the \nsCOD were 80% in the influent and 12% in the effluents. Therefore, the BAFs \nachieved a mean sBOD removal of 96%. In both BAFs, sCOD removal was not \nimpaired after backwashing and any reductions in removal were related to an \nunusually high, or low, influent concentration. \n8 \nNitrification was first observed on day 20, and by day 37 the effluent ammoniacal \nnitrogen concentration was 0.1 mg l-1 from the smaller medium reactor and 3.7 mg l-1 \nfrom the larger medium reactor. Ammoniacal nitrogen removal did not stabilise, \nmainly because the influent concentration was highly variable (between 13.3 and 46 \nmg l-1). The low ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations in the effluents on day 37 were \nonly repeated on day 61, after influent concentrations dropped from above 40 mg l-1 \nto below 15 mg l-1. \n \nPerforming paired t-tests on the effluent results during stable operation indicated that \nthere were significant differences in the suspended solids, sCOD and the ammoniacal \nnitrogen concentrations of the two reactors (p-values <0.001, 0.03 and <0.001 \nrespectively).  \n \nThe reactors had approximately 0.85 m clearance above the media beds to allow head \nloss development during the filter cycle. The maximum run time at each flow rate \noccurred when the maximum head loss was reached. At all flow rates, the reactor \nusing the larger medium had longer filter run times. However, the difference between \nthe maximum run times of the two reactors decreased as the flow rate was increased \n(Table 4). When a flow rate of 0.3 l min-1 was applied, there was a period when both \nreactors operated without much increase in head loss, followed by a logarithmic rise \nin pressure (Figure 5). Meanwhile, when a flow rate of 0.4 l min-1 was applied, the \nhead loss above the reactor containing the larger medium increased more linearly with \ntime (Figure 6). With a flow rate of 0.6 l min-1 the head loss above both reactors \nincreased linearly for a period before a logarithmic rise in pressure. \n \n9 \nPlots of the SS concentrations (C) against reactor height (H) gave typical first-order \ncurves which could be described by Equation 1. \n \n-dC\/dt = kC (or after integration: ln [C\/C0] = kt)     (1) \n \nWhere C0 is the influent SS concentration and k is the rate constant. The time (t) \ncorresponds to: HA\/Q where, A is the cross-sectional area of the reactor and Q is the \nvolumetric flow rate. For a first-order relationship, plotting ln(C\/C0) versus height \nresults in a linear regression line with a gradient (m) equal to kA\/Q (Figure 7). The \nfirst-order constant (k or mQ\/A) for SS removal was higher for the BAF using small \nStarLight C than the BAF using larger StarLight C (Table 5). The R2 values for these \ngraphs were consistently over 0.9, which validates the assumption of first-order \nkinetics.  \n \nWhen using the smaller medium, the majority of profiles indicated that only part of \nthe filter was being utilised for SS removal. The mean active depth was 1.7 m and in \nthe most extreme case, only the first 1.3 m of the filter bed removed SS before the \nconcentrations stabilised (Figure 8). A greater proportion of the filter bed was used for \nSS removal in the BAF using the larger StarLight. In both reactors, there were no \nsignificant changes to the mean values of m, k or the depth of filter used for SS \nremoval after the influent flow rate was increased.  \n10 \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe tracer studies for the BAF containing large StarLight were compared with those \nconducted previously under identical conditions using the smaller StarLight, \nexpanded clay, sand and plastic media (Moore et al., 1999b). This indicated that \npacked beds of the larger StarLight and the expanded clay medium have similar \nhydraulic properties. Although these two media are different shapes, packed beds of \nboth have voidage levels of approximately 45%. On empty bed trials using these two \nmedia, the peak tracer concentration appeared before the theoretical hydraulic \nresidence time (tHRT), indicating the occurrence of channelling. However, when \ntracer studies were conducted on an operating bed of the expanded clay just before \nbackwashing, channelling was no longer apparent, due to re-compaction and biofilm \ngrowth closing the preferential channels. In conclusion, the tracer study results for \nlarge StarLight highlight that poor performance, especially immediately after \nbackwashing, may result from preferential channelling. Meanwhile, the reactor \ncontaining the smaller StarLight showed better plug flow conditions, which improves \nnitrification and solids removal (Mann et al., 1995, Fdz-Polanco et al., 1994). Any \nfurther increases in the size of StarLight would probably increase the levels of mixing \nso that the flow through the reactor no longer approximated plug flow. \nCorrespondingly, nitrification would deteriorate as observed when using 3-6 mm, \ncompared to 2-4 mm, expanded schist (Paffoni et al., 1990). \n \nThe effluents contained consistently lower levels of organic matter than required by \nmany consents. The medium with the smaller size range showed significantly better \nsCOD and ammoniacal nitrogen removal. Ammoniacal nitrogen removal is a good \n11 \nindicator of biological performance since nitrifying bacteria are easily out-competed \nby heterotrophic micro-organisms. Therefore in a fixed-film, plug flow reactor, \nnitrification only occurs once COD levels are low, at the base of the reactor when \nusing a downflow configuration. The results suggest that COD penetrated deeper into \nthe reactor containing the larger medium. Thus, a BAF containing the smaller medium \nwould treat a greater mass of substrate per volume of reactor. However, it may be \npossible to obtain similar performance and reactor footprint using the larger sized \nmedium, by increasing the media depth.  \n \nBoth reactors showed improved COD removal when the flow rate was increased from \n0.3 to 0.4 l min-1. This could be accounted for by changes in the influent composition, \nwhich occurred at the same time as the flow rate was increased. Alternatively, the \nincreased liquid velocity may have improved substrate transfer into the biofilm \n(Peladan et al., 1996) and, by controlling the biofilm thickness, removed internal \ndiffusion limitations (Lazarova & Manem, 1994). COD removal was not adversely \naffected by further increases in the flow rate. However, the lower ammoniacal \nnitrogen removal observed at 0.6 l min-1 indicates that biological performance would \neventually decrease with increasing flow rate. \n \nEffluent SS consent levels are often set at or below 35 mg l-1. The mean \nconcentrations for both effluents at all flow rates were below this concentration. \nHowever, the standard could be exceeded for over twenty minutes after backwashing \nthe larger medium reactor. Backwash recovery times of up to 45 minutes have been \nreported previously and, in a multi-cell arrangement, significant effects on effluent \nquality can be avoided (Budge & Gorrie, 1996).  \n12 \n \nA full-scale BAF may have improved operability and show lower media washout \nrates using the larger sized medium because it would be easier to separate media \nparticles from the backwash water. Additionally, with its longer filter run times, the \nBAF using the larger medium would be the most efficient reactor in terms of \noperating costs. In BAF facilities with numerous cells, run-times below 24 hours are \ndesirable to minimise the possibility that several cells require backwashing \nsimultaneously (Stensel et al., 1988). Therefore, the smaller medium may be limited \nto applications where the liquid velocity is below 2.4 m h-1.  \n \nAs well as having different run times, the pattern of head loss development differed \nusing the two sizes of media. The head loss development and SS profile results can be \ninterpreted by assuming that similar filtration mechanisms operate in deep, submerged \nfilters and BAFs. Solids are transported to the surface of depth filter media grains by a \ncombination of interception, diffusion and sedimentation (Bouwer, 1987). Deep bed \nfilters are said to ripen because their performance improves initially during operation, \nas particle deposition increases the apparent filter grain size and reduces the filter \nporosity (Choo & Tien, 1993). In BAFs, this process will be combined with the \nmetabolism of suspended matter and biofilm growth (Takahashi et al., 1969). Head \nloss development occurs in deep, submerged filters as deposited solids reduce the \nfilter porosity.  \n \nEfficient deep, submerged filters exhibit linear head loss development, and block \nwhen the solids holding capacity is reached. Backwashing is required either at this \ntime, or when the head loss profile causes air pockets to develop in the lower regions \n13 \nof the filter. Air pockets effectively block pores, causing an increase in local flow \nrates and subsequently a decrease in filtrate quality (Ives, 1969). Solids are removed \nthroughout the depth of an efficient deep filter, and the reaction can be characterised \nby a first-order equation. Meanwhile, under-performing filters remove smaller \nproportions of solids in each successive layer of media. Prior to reaching the solids \nholding capacity, the porosity at the top of such filters has been reduced sufficiently to \ninduce physical straining. This causes the rapid production of a surface mat of \ndeposit, and subsequently there is a logarithmic rise in head loss with time (Ives, \n1969). Under-performing filters are undesirable since they require more frequent \nbackwashing and have higher operating costs without offering any advantages. \n \nAt flow rates of 0.3 and 0.4 l min-1, the SS removal profiles indicated that the BAF \nusing the smaller medium was under-performing as a filter. Solids were not removed \nthroughout the filter depth, so it is unlikely that the filter\u2019s solids holding capacity was \never reached. Additionally, the reactor showed a tendency for logarithmic rather than \nlinear head loss development. It is likely that the under-performance of the smaller \nStarLight as a depth filter medium was part of the reason that shorter run times were \nrecorded.  \n \nThere appears to be a complex relationship between the influent characteristics and \nflow rate, the reactor height and media size, and the performance in terms of both \neffluent standards and operating costs. The topic warrants further investigation to \ndetermine optimal media sizes for different conditions. Dual media BAFs also have \npotential since they could combine the high performance properties of smaller media \nwith the lower operating costs associated with larger media. This may be particularly \n14 \nsuccessful using foamed clay, since the particle density can be controlled so that a \nlayer of larger medium could be maintained above a layer of smaller medium. \n15 \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n1. Using either of the size ranges of StarLight C, the BAFs produced effluents with \nmean concentrations of SS and COD within most consent levels, at loadings over \n12 kg tCOD m-3 d and 4 kg  SS m-3 d. (based on working volumes). \n \n2. The BAF utilising the smaller medium exhibited up to 70% shorter maximum run \ntimes than the BAF using the larger medium. The hydraulic loading of the small \nmedium reactors may need to be restricted to below 2.4 m h-1 to prevent units \nrequiring simultaneous backwashing. Additionally, the larger medium will be \neasier to separate from backwash water, which may improve process operability \nand reduce media washout. \n \n3. The SS profiles and head loss development graphs indicated that the smaller \nmedium was frequently exhibiting inefficient depth filtration. This partly \nexplained the differences in filter run times and is highly undesirable. \n  \n4. The larger sized medium showed some inconsistency in SS removal immediately \nafter backwashing at flow rates over 0.3 l min-1, and inferior nitrification results. It \nis unclear whether this was due to the reactor having a decreased surface area per \nunit volume or a higher degree of mixing.  \n \n16 \nAcknowledgements \nR.
