I would hate to think that the model has served to cut off\nany discourses about e-learning at a time of huge potential for the future of higher and\nprofessional education. No one benefits by any model being taken or used uncritically\nor out of context or culture. The challenges we face in providing exciting, worthwhile\nand effective learning through whatever medium grow daily. I would be so pleased if\nothers could respond too, so that this model, first developed more than 12 years ago\nin a different era but since used extensively, could continue to be further examined\nfor relevance and helpfulness.\nThe five-stage model is rooted in social constructivism as Dr Moule spotted, but\nmore as an underlying philosophy of the world of knowledge than as an instructional\nor normative theoretical stance. The model was originally researched using the liter-\nature of the day and large-scale text-based asynchronous conferencing platforms\n(CoSy and FirstClass) in the first few years of the 1990s when virtual learning envi-\nronments still weakly twinkled in the developers\u2019 eyes. My study deployed cognitive\nmapping methodology (Eden & Ackermann, 1998) and resulted in the emergent\ngrounded five-stage model. More than 1000 students and tutors in distance-taught\nOpen University Business School courses were involved. At the time they were\noffered free rein, through the software, to interact with each other in whatever ways\nthey chose. I would find it all but impossible, perhaps unethical, to undertake such a\nstudy now so I am glad I did so at the time, over two years.\nI suspect that the grounded nature of the model later resulted in its popularity as a\ndevice for understanding, since it felt \u2018natural\u2019 and educators and learners reported\n\u2018ah ha!\u2019 moments of recognition of their early online experiences. No prior theories of\nlearning were \u2018applied\u2019, although they were later used to interpret and build upon\nconstantly emerging understandings and uses.\nThe model \u2018caught on\u2019 when the first edition of E-moderating was published in 2000\n(Salmon, 2000, 2004). My approach in that book was to describe one major applica-\ntion of it\u2014to explain the competencies and training development of online university\nteachers and facilitators and all the different ways in which these can be promoted and\n*Beyond Distance Research Alliance, Attenborough Tower, University of Leicester, University\nRoad, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK.

That work continues still and more recently has been combined with a\nwide range of established face-to-face group work (www.learningingroups.com) in\nthe service of learning. There have been many others in different contexts who have\nused and written about it, not only for e-moderating training but for student and\ncommunity development.\nFor me, the five-stage model\u2019s popularity arises because it works as a framework\nfor use that has enabled individual academics and course teams (often those work-\ning without the benefit of instructional designers) wishing to work online produc-\ntively, to customise, personalise and adapt it to many purposes, contexts, countries\nand technologies rather than as a constraint. It\u2019s proved \u2018blendable\u2019 in its applica-\ntion to notions of communities of practice (see, for example, our use in a widescale\ncommunity of expertise project: http:\/\/uk.omnium.net.au\/elks\/base\/) and to growing\nnotions of e-literacy among learners of different kinds. We now have the \u2018blessing\u2019\nof virtual learning environments and of many more learning and knowledge\ntechnologies. There is also a range of new issues where the model is still providing a\nrelevant backdrop, typically in conjunction with small-scale low-cost online activi-\nties (Salmon, 2002). For example, at the University of Leicester we are now apply-\ning it across disciplines from arts to science in campus-based and distance learning\nthrough our Higher Education Academy (HEA)-funded pathfinder project \u2018Adelie\u2019\n(www.le.ac.uk\/adelie) as well as in Web 2.0 research including blogs, wikis and\npodcasting (www.impala.ac.uk). We have found, for example, that the model is\nuseful is encouraging wiki use among small professional communities and in blend-\ning podcasting into virtual learning environments.\nA key issue that is raised by the suggested \u2018ladder\u2019 approach in the Moule article is\none that we are currently researching at Leicester through Tony Churchill\u2019s study,\nand one with which I am sure many readers of ALT-J are wrestling. To what extent\nand in what ways can we suggest, enable, encourage, promote (demand that)\nacademic staff design for presenting and facilitating online learning? There is no\nevidence so far that there is an easy pathway between instructivist and constructivist\napproaches. Many courses report learners and teachers tipping into the abyss as\nattempts are made to move from information provision to knowledge generation. Can\nit be a choice, a step-by-step approach, or does it need evangelical support or lots of\nstaff development? Can we explore this?\nReferences\nEden, C. & Ackermann, F.
