INTRODUCTION \nThe study of a gasification process producing syngas for high performance thermodynamic cycle \nwas carried out in two steps: \n1. simulation of the gasification process, gas purification and its utilisation in the energy \nproduction cycle, performed in a previous study and reported for clarity in the present paper \n(Corti and Lombardi, 2002). \n2. Life Cycle Assessment of the cycle, including biomass production (energy crops) and plant \nconstruction\/dismantling, presented in this paper. \nThe schematic of the Integrated Biomass Gasification Combined Cycle (IBGCC) is shown in figure \n1 and consists basically in biomass gasification and syngas cleaning before its utilisation in a \nconventional combined cycle (Brayton\/Hirn). \nThe aim of the process is to obtain a gas with high hydrogen content and low carbon dioxide \ncontent, suitable for the utilisation in a gas turbine. \nBiomass and air are fed to an atmospheric pressure gasifier. The obtained syngas is first driven to \na cyclone, to remove solid particles, and thus supplied to a catalytic shift reactor to convert carbon \nmonoxide into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, using steam. The goal of this process is to increase \nH2 and CO2 concentrations before CO2 removal.  \nDownstream the shift reaction process, a CO2 removal is performed in order to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and to produce a higher LHV fuel. This process consists in chemical absorption by \nmeans of an aqueous amine blended solution (diethanolamine, DEA, and methyldiethanolamine, \nMDEA). In this way, a syngas with high hydrogen content is obtained and then fed to the \ncombustion chamber of the gas turbine. \nThe energy conversion is obtained by means of a conventional combined cycle, integrated with \nmany energy recovers along the process. Steam from the steam turbine is extracted in order to \nsupply the energy requirement for both amine regeneration and shift reaction process. \nThe simulation was performed by means of a model (Carpentieri 2001) developed with Aspen Plus \n10.1-0 (AspenTech 2001). \n 2\n Figure 1 Schematic of the IBGCC + DeCO2 \n \n2. GASIFICATION PROCESS AND SHIFT REACTION \nThe gasification reactor, simulated as an equilibrium reactor, is fed with biomass (fixed flow rate 31 \nkg\/s) and air, and produces raw syngas and sludge. The considered biomass (table 1) has a Low \nHeating Value (LHV) of about 18,000 kJ\/kg (Domalski and Jobe 1987). \n \nProximate analysis Ultimate analysis \nMoisture 15 % Ash 1.34 % \nFixed Carbon 16.35 % Carbon 48.45 % \nVolatile Matter 82.32 % Hydrogen 5.85 % \nAsh 1.33 % Nitrogen 0.47 % \nChlorine 0.1 % \nSulfur 0.01 %  \nOxygen 43.78 % \n \nTable 1 Biomass composition (poplar). Mass fractions \n \nGenerally, a gasification process is fed with an oxidant medium (air or oxygen) and steam, this last \nto promote the shift reaction. In this study no steam is fed to the gasifier, since the presence of a \ndevoted shift reaction section assures the CO conversion into CO2 to take place later, even with \nhigher conversion rate. \nThe inlet air flow rate was adjusted to obtain the best result in term of LHV of the raw syngas. The \nresult is a low value for the gasification air ratio (e=Air\/Airstech=0.2) (Carpentieri 2001). \n 3\nAn atmospheric pressure gasifier was chosen (Carpentieri 2001) because of the higher \ndevelopment level of this technology (Williams and Larson 1996). \nThe composition of the produced syngas was calculated by means of the chemical processes \nsimulator Aspen Plus (Carpentieri 2001); the gasifier was theoretically modelled as an equilibrium \nreactor. \nAccording to figure 2, the raw syngas is first cooled (HE1), then is fed to the cyclone, where 95% of \nfly ashes and all the unconverted carbon are removed and recirculated back to the gasifier. \nThe shift section consists of a two stage process with a high temperature reactor (450\u00b0C) and a \nlow temperature reactor (250\u00b0C). The whole amount of steam required for the two reactors \n(extracted form the steam turbine) is fed to the first reactor (Chiesa and Consonni 1998, Hendriks \n1994). \nThe exothermic reaction, that consists in the conversion of carbon monoxide and steam into \ncarbon dioxide and hydrogen, is the following: \nCO + H2O \u2192 CO2 + H2 + 44.477 MJ\/molCO    (1) \nThe resulting fuel gas has a high H2 and CO2 content, even if it is quite diluted due to the presence \nof nitrogen. Thus, the next step is the removal of the carbon dioxide, facilitated by the obtained \nhigh concentration (table 2). \n \n \nFigure 2 Schematic of the gasification and shift reaction section \n \nDue to the exothermic nature of the reaction, both the reactors are provided with heat recovery, in \norder to maintain the temperatures at fixed values and to minimize the losses. \n 4\nTwo more heat exchangers have been included in the scheme. The first one (HE2) cools the gas \nafter the first shift reactor down to the inlet temperature of the second shift reactor. The second \nheat exchanger (HE3) cools the gas downstream the second reactor down to the inlet temperature \nof the CO2 removal section (30\u00b0C). \nThe H2O\/CO ratio was set equal to 2 (Chiesa and Consonni 1998, Hendriks 1994, Kohl and \nRiesenfeld 1985), hence, the required steam flow rate is 31.9 kg\/s. \nThe gasifier temperature (TGAS) and the first heat exchanger temperature (THE1) have been defined \nby means of a partial exergetic analysis (Carpentieri 2001). The values that maximize the exergy \nbalance are TGAS=1100\u00b0C and THE1=270\u00b0C. \n \nFlow rate [kg\/s] 70.94 \nTemperature [\u00b0C] 30 \nPressure [bar] 1.01325 \nComposition Mass fraction Mole fraction \nH2O 3.9 % 4.2 % \nCO2 65.1 % 28.6 % \nN2 25.1 % 17.3 % \nH2 5.2 % 49.5 % \nCO 0.2 % 0.1 % \nAr 0.5 % 0.2 % \nHCl 380 ppm 201 ppm \nH2S 38 ppm 21 ppm \nCH4 3 ppm 3 ppm \nCOS 2 ppm 0.8 ppm \nNH3 4 ppm 4 ppm \nHCN 1 ppm 0.8 ppm \nNO,SO2,C2H6 Trace \nLHV [kJ\/kg] 6217 \n \nTable 2 Syngas features exiting the shift reaction section \n \n3. CO2 REMOVAL \nChemical absorption has been selected because it is a well-developed technology and is \nparticularly suitable for quite high CO2 concentration (Eliasson 1998). The absorbing medium is an \naqueous amine blended solution, which is regenerated by means of temperature swing (TSA \nTemperature swing absorption process). According to previous study (Corti and Manfrida 1999), \nusing the appropriate blend of DEA (diethanolamine) and MDEA (methyldiethanolamine) it is \n 5\npossible to keep the regeneration heat requirement lower than 4 MJ\/kgCO2REMOVED. The system \nconsists of an absorption tower (inlet streams: raw syngas, water and amines; outlet streams: \ncleaned syngas and solution loaded with CO2) and a stripper to regenerate the solution. A more \ndetailed description can be found in (Corti and Lombardi 1998). \nWith reference to the specific syngas composition, the most suitable solution blend has been \ninvestigated (Carpentieri 2001, Corti and Lombardi 2002), considering total amine content (mass \nfraction) equal to 30, 40 and 50% and varying the DEA and MDEA mass fractions. \n50% amine solutions allow reaching defined CO2 removal efficiency with lower solution mass flow \nrate and hence lower energy requirement than the less concentrated solutions. \nResults for different DEA and MDEA mass fractions, for a total content of 50%, considering 80% \nCO2 removal efficiency (to be comparable with previous studies (Corti and Manfrida 1999, Corti \nand Lombardi 1998)), showed a maximum value for the cycle power output (i.e. maximum cycle \nefficiency, being constant the biomass input) - hence a minimum CO2 removal energy requirement \n\u2013 corresponding to a 20% DEA and 30% MDEA composition (figure 3). Specific energy \nrequirement is about 3.4 MJ\/kgCO2REMOVED, that is supplied in part by means of regenerative heat \nrecovery (lean\/load solution heat exchanger) and in part by steam extraction in the power section. \nThis condition corresponds to a required solution mass flow rate (557 kg\/s) - determinant for plant \ninvestment cost definition - not minimized, but not far from the minimum value (531 kg\/s) obtained \nfor a 30% DEA and 20% MDEA composition (figure 4). \nThe characteristics and composition of syngas exiting CO2 removal section are reported in table 3: \nthe heating value is almost doubled, with respect to the entering syngas, due to the removal of \ndiluting CO2. \n        \nFigure 3 Power output vs. solution composition \n 6\n  \n     Figure 4 Solution mass flow rate vs. solution composition \n \nFlow rate [kg\/s] 38.82 \nTemperature [\u00b0C] 554 \nComposition Mass fraction Mole fraction \nH2O 19.6 % 13.6 % \nCO2 23.8 % 6.8 % \nN2 45.9 % 20.5 % \nH2 9.4 % 58.6 % \nCO 0.3 % 0.2 % \nAr 0.8 % 0.3 % \nH2S 60 ppm 22 ppm \nHCl 658 ppm 226 ppm \nMDEA 135 ppm 14 ppm \nDEA 4 ppm 0.4 ppm \nCH4 5 ppm 4 ppm \nCOS 4 ppm 0.8 ppm \nNH3 5 ppm 4 ppm \nHCN 2 ppm 0.7 ppm \nSO2, NO, C2H6 Trace Trace \nLHV [kJ\/kg] 11364 kJ\/kg \n \nTable 3 Syngas features exiting the CO2 removal section \n \n4. POWER GENERATION SECTION \nThe power generation scheme is a conventional Brayton\/Hirn combined cycle, with the addition of \nthe syngas compressor and the heat recoveries in the different syngas treatment sections. Gas \nturbine (GT) operating conditions have been defined according to a reference technology level: \ncorresponding to an aero-derivative GT, with the characteristics summarized in table 4. \nFor the syngas compression up to the combustion chamber pressure, a three-staged intercooled \ncompressor has been considered (2.5, 7 and 19 bar). \n 7\n GT inlet temperature [\u00b0C] 1258 \nGT outlet temperature [\u00b0C] 537 \nCompressor outlet temperature [\u00b0C] 454 \nCompression ratio 19 \n \nTable 4 GT reference technology operating conditions \n \nA two-pressure levels steam bottoming cycle has been considered with high pressure (HP) steam \nat 40 bar and 450 \u00b0C, and low pressure (LP) steam at 2.5 bar and 168.1 \u00b0C. \nHeat recoveries from different cycle sections \u2013 in addition to the heat recovery steam generator \n(HRSG) from GT exhausts - have been arranged in order to maximize the produced steam flow \nrate. \n \n5. SIMULATION RESULTS \nSimulation results are reported in table 5. Syngas compression work represents a high fraction of \nthe total combined cycle power output, about 18.5%, and quite greatly contributes to the efficiency \nreduction with respect to a pressurized ICGCC (46.6%) in a conventional configuration or with CO2 \nchemical absorption (38.8%) (Fiaschi and Lombardi 2001). \nThe additional consumption \u2013 of  355 kJ\/kgCO2 (Lombardi 2003) - for CO2 compression up to 80 bar \nwas considered. \n \nSyngas compressor power [kW] 37,929 ST power (HP) [kW] 37,255 \nAir compressor power [kW] 192,666 ST power (LP) [kW] 17,900 \nGT power [kW] 379,942 Pump power [kW] 511 \nGT net power [MW] 149.347 ST net power [MW] 55.155 \nCO2 compressor power [MW] 13 \nCombined cycle net power [MW] 191.386 \nEfficiency [%] 33.94 \nSpecific CO2 emissions [kgCO2\/MWh] 178 \n \nTable 5 IBGCC+DeCO2 simulation results (ST=steam turbine) \n \nSpecific CO2 emissions can be directly compared with values obtained from previous studies \n(Fiaschi and Lombardi 2001) for a conventional ICGCC \u2013 725 kgCO2\/MWh - and an ICGCC with \n 8\nCO2 removal \u2013 130 kgCO2\/MWh.

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) \nA life cycle assessment study consists of several phases: goal and scope definition, inventory \nanalysis, impact assessment and interpretation and improvement (ISO 14040 1998). In the \nfollowing each step is described with regard to this work. \nThe first stage is the \u201cGoal definition and scoping\u201d, as described in the ISO 14041 (1998), and it \nincludes the definition of the functional unit. \nThe aim of this work is to assess the environmental impact, on a life cycle horizon, of the biomass \nutilization in energy production. The contributions of the different life cycle phases to the overall \nimpacts are highlighted in order to assess the most impacting phases. Further, a comparison with \nan analogous LCA study of a similar energy conversion cycle fed with coal (ICGCC) was carried \nout. \nThe reference functional unit for the inventory analysis and impact assessment is the energy \nproduction of 1MJ. \nThe considered system includes: biomass production and transportation, plant construction, \nenergy conversion (operating life 15 years) and plant maintenance, plant dismantling (see table 6). \nIn the biomass production and transportation phase were considered within the boundaries: the \nchemical processes for the production of fertilisers and herbicides, the use of these substances for \nthe biomass cultivation, the biogenic emissions from the biomass, the CO2 sequestration due to \nphotosynthesis of biomass, the production of fuel and its utilisation in the machines for the biomass \ncultivation, the production of fuel and its utilisation for the biomass transportation. The construction \nof the buildings necessary for the biomass cultivation and the construction of the machines were \nnot accounted for (Rafaschieri et al. 1999) and considered negligible. \nThe plant construction includes: the production of raw materials required for the plant devices and \nthe emission due to the assembly of materials. \nThe operating phase consists of: water consumption for CO2 removal section and steam cycle, \namines production, regeneration of activated carbons, raw materials production for maintenance, \nstack emissions, process wastes. \n 10\nThe dismantling phase comprises energy consumption for dismantling, recycling and transportation \nof materials. \nThus the whole system has been schematised in the inventory analysis in term of raw material \ninput and output emissions (solid, liquid and gaseous). \n \n7. LCA \u2013 INVENTORY ANALYSIS \nAny product or service needs to be represented as a system in the inventory analysis \nmethodology. A system is defined as a collection of materially and energetically connected \noperations (e.g. manufacturing process, transport process, fuel extraction process) which perform \nsome defined function. The inventory analysis is a quantitative description of all flows of materials \nand energy across the system boundary either into or out of the system itself (ISO 14041 1998). \nThe considered processes are summarised in table 7. \n \nPlant construction \nBiomass cultivation Biomass production Biomass transportation \nEnergy conversion Operating phase Maintenance \nPlant dismantling \n \nTable 7 Processes for LCA \n \nThe considered biomass production ratio is equal to 13.4 ton per hectare per year, with a \ncultivation cycle of seven years (Mann and Spath 1997). \nMainly the use of agricultural machines for seeding, growing and collection phases and the use of \npesticides and fertilizers have been considered using data according to (Mann and Spath 1997) \nand summarized in table 8. No consumption of water and energy for watering has been \nconsidered, since it has been assumed that all the required water is supplied by rainfall.  \n \n \n \n 11\nN-fertilizers application (50\/50 urea and ammonium nitrate) 100 kg\/ha (nitrate) during 4th year \nP-fertilizers application 22,4 kg\/ha (as P) during 1st year \nK-fertilizers application (K2O) 39.2 kg\/ha (as K) during 1st year \nPre-emergency herbicide (Oust\u2122) application 36.5 cm3 a.s.\/ha during 1st and 2nd years \nPost-emergency herbicide (Roundup\u2122) application 36.5 cm3 a.s.\/ha during 1st and 2nd years \nPesticide application Not considered \n \nTable 8 Biomass growing phase data \n \nFuel consumption for agricultural machines has been calculated, with reference to the operations \nin table 8, using emission factors in (Mann and Spath 1997) and (EMEP\/CORINAIR 1999). No \ncontribution due to construction and dismantling of agricultural machines has been considered.  \nAtmospheric emission factors for the use of fertilizers and pesticides\/herbicides have been \nretrieved respectively from (EMEP\/CORINAIR 1999) and (Rafaschieri et al. 1999). \nData for the production processes of manufactured materials entering the system (fertilizers, \npesticides\/herbicides, fuels, electricity, etc.) have been retrieved from LCA devoted databases \n(SimaPro 1997, I-LCA 2000). \nCarbon dioxide assimilated by the biomass during the growing phase corresponds to the amount \nof carbon in the biomass composition, equal to 48% in mass. Hence, for each kilogram of carbon in \nthe biomass about 3.67 kg of carbon dioxide have been subtracted from the atmosphere. \nBiomass transportation average distance has been assumed equal to 75 km, covered by truck. \nAtmospheric emissions and fuel consumptions have been calculated with the help of \n(EMEP\/CORINAIR 1999).  \nMoreover, a 20% loss of dry substance during ambient conditions drying process has been \nconsidered (Rafaschieri et al. 1999). \nFor the construction phase the main materials have been considered (steel, cast iron, aluminium, \ncopper, plastic, rubber asphalt and cement), accounting for their production processes (SimaPro \n1997). The amounts of these materials have been estimated by a rough sizing of the main devices \nin the plant and with reference to a similar plant fed with coal (Lombardi 2003), up-scaling or down-\nscaling the devices. Further, the on-site energy consumption for construction has been considered, \ntoo (Lombardi 2003). \n 12\nInventory data for the energy production phase come from the IBGCC Aspen Plus simulation \n(Carpentieri 2001) and are reported in table 9. \n \nCompound Mass fraction \nO2 12.94% \nN2 71.70% \nAr 0.92% \nH2O 13.08% \nCO2 1.26% \nCO 0.06 ppm \nNH3 Trace \nH2 0.2 ppm \nHCl 41 ppm \nNO 0.1% \nSO2 4 ppm \nNO2 15 ppm \nSO3 0.2 ppm \n \nTable 9 Stack emissions data \n \nContributions from device maintenance - basically material consumption for worn-out part \nsubstitution (Lombardi 2003) - have been accounted for, using SimaPro database (SimaPro 1997). \nData for the activated carbons regeneration have been retrieved from (SimaPro 1997), too. \nInventory data for amines production was not available because the required data are proprietary \ninformation.  \nIn order to give an estimation of the error connected to neglecting the input consumption \n(Lombardi, 2001), mainly energy, and pollutants emissions during the production process of \namines, data for the production processes of other chemicals have been taken from SimaPro \n(SimaPro 1997). Choosing, for example, two chemicals, respectively with low and very high energy \nrequirement for the production process, it is possible to estimate the range within the error varies. \nAmong the chemicals in SimaPro, Ureum I (CASE 1), with an energy input of 17.9 MJ\/kg, and the \ntoluene-diisocyanate \u2013 and in particular the record named TDI I - (CASE 2), with an energy input of \n145 MJ\/kg, have been chosen, just as representing very different values of energy-intensive \nchemical products. \n 13\nIn (Lombardi, 2001) it is possible to verify that the influence on the results considering the above \nrange is very low.  \nHence, in the following the input amount of consumed amines has been substituted with the same \namount of the high energy consuming chemical, considering the worse possible case.  \nConcerning the dismantling phase, energy consumption and the connected emissions for the \non-site work and recycling processes have been considered (Lombardi 2003). The material recycle \nis considered as negative emissions in the avoided production of new materials. The SimaPro \ndatabase was used for this phase. \n \n8. LCA \u2013 IMPACT ASSESSMENT \nLife cycle impact assessment (ISO\/CD 14042 1999) examines the mass and energy inventory \ninput and output data for a product system to translate these data to better identify their possible \nenvironmental relevance and significance. This translation uses, where possible, numerical \nindicators for specific subjects or categories, where the indicator reflects in some manner the \nsystem environmental loading or resource depletion for that category. These indicators then \nconstitute an environmental loading and resource depletion profile for a system. This profile with \npossible further analysis and weighting is intended to provide an additional useful perspective on \nthe possible environmental significance in one or more general areas of resources, natural \nenvironment and human health. \nIn this study, the results of the impact assessment are presented according to the Eco-indicator\u201995 \nmethodology (Goedkoop 1995), whose indicators are summarised in table 10, with the respective \nunits. \n \nGreenhouse effect [kgCO2 eq.\/f.u.] Winter smog [kgSPM eq.\/f.u.] \nOzone layer depletion [kgCFC11 eq.\/f.u.] Summer smog [kgC2H4 eq.\/f.u.] \nAcidification [kgSO4 eq.\/f.u.] Pesticides [kgact.s.\/f.u.] \nEutrophication [kgSO2 eq.\/f.u.] Energy [MJ\/f.u.] \nHeavy metals [kgPb eq.\/f.u.] Solid waste [kg\/f.u.] \nCarcinogenic substances [kgB(a)P eq.\/f.u.]  \n \nTable 10 Reference indicators for impact assessment. \n 14\n Besides the indicators of Eco-Indicator 95 methodology, two more indicators were considered: \nEnergy and Solid waste. The former was considered in order to account for raw materials \nconsumption (in terms of LHV), the latter takes into account the production of waste and, hence, it \nis related to the land use for landfilling. \n \n9. LCA \u2013 RESULTS \nThe final stage of LCA is the interpretation phase (ISO\/DIS 14043 1999), where inventory analysis \nand impact assessment results are summarized and discussed. \nResults, referred to the functional unit - 1 MJ of energy production \u2013 are reported in table 10 and in \nfigure 5.

Due to this contribution the indicator value becomes negative, meaning a substantial \nsubtraction of equivalent CO2 from atmosphere. \nIn fact, the CO2 balance shows a more than 100% closure (finally there is less CO2 in the \natmosphere). In absence of the CO2 removal section, the balance closure would have not been \ncomplete (about 90%) (Corti et al. 2002). It is reasonable to suppose that if also the final CO2 \ndisposal was considered the balance closure would be lower than what presently found, since \nadditional emissions would be due to the transportation process and final storage (in deep ocean  \n(Golomb et al. 1989, Golomb and Angelopoulos 2000, IEA 2001), in exhausted oil reservoirs (IEA \n2001), in aquifers (IEA 2001)). These additional processes were not considered in the present \nstudy and it would be worth to analyse also this phase in case of available data about it. \n 16\nFigure 6 shows the final Eco-indicator values, for each considered phase, calculated according to \nthe Eco-Indicator 95 methodology (Goedkoop 1995), after normalisation and weighting of the \nindicators in table 11. The final Eco-indicator allows the comparison of the different production \nstages: construction and dismantling are negligible compared to other processes; operating phase \nis the worst process from an environmental point of view. \n-0.00005\n0\n0.00005\n0.0001\n0.00015\n0.0002\n0.00025\nCo\nntr\nuc\ntio\nn\nB.P\nrod\nuc\ntio\nn\nOp\nera\ntin\ng\nDis\nma\nntl\ning\nEco-indicator 95\n \nFigure 6 Eco-indicator 95 value \n \n \n10. COMPARISON WITH ICGCC \nTo better highlight the results of LCA performed in this paper, they have been compared with an \nanalogous LCA of an ICGCC (Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle) with CO2 removal \n(Lombardi, 2003). In that previous study the same data were used for the construction, \nmaintenance and dismantling of the plant, accounting for the different devices. A similar process \nsimulation was carried out (Lombardi 2003) using Aspen Plus, which has provided stack emissions \ndata as in this case. The plant outline was the same of the IBGCC plant, except for: \n\u2022 the presence of a pressurised gasifier fed with coal (thus the absence of a compression stage \nbefore syngas utilisation in the combustion chamber); \n 17\n\u2022 the presence of a H2S removal section; \n\u2022 the absence of the biomass cultivation and transportation phase (substituted by coal mining \nand transportation). \nFigure 7 shows the comparison of the IBGCC greenhouse effect indicator with the greenhouse \neffect indicator for the ICGCC (Lombardi, 2003). It is interesting to highlight the high IBGCC \nimpact, when the CO2 sink due to biomass photosynthesis is not included in the calculation. In fact, \nin this case, the biomass production and transport impact, for the IBGCC, is higher than the coal \nextraction impact, in the ICGCC, while the operating phase has a similar impact in both cases \n(Corti et al. 2002). \n-0.2\n-0.15\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nICGCC IBGCC (without b.grow.ph.)

This is due both to the \nelevated impact of biomass production phase (in particular for acidification, eutrophication, heavy \nmetals and carcinogenic substances) and to the lower energy conversion efficiency of the IBGCC \n(see the figures 11 to 13). \n0 5E-10 0.000000001 1.5E-09 0.000000002 2.5E-09\nOzone layer depletion\nCarcinogenic sub.\nCOAL BIOMASS\n \nFigure 11 Fuel production phase comparison (carcinogenic substances and ozone layer depletion \nindicators).

As shown in figure 14, the two Eco-indicators are \ncomparable, with a result slightly better for the coal. Nevertheless a comment is necessary: the \nEco-Indicator 95 methodology is very incomplete in this case, because it takes into account for \nonly the material emissions to the environment, ignoring, for example, the advantages due to the \nutilization of a renewable energy as the biomass (energy and solid waste indicators are not \nincluded in the final indicator calculation). Thus a more general comparison between the two \noptions, by means of a more complete methodology, as the Eco-Indicator 99 (Goedkoop and \nSpriensma 2000) or the CML guidelines (Guin\u00e9e et al. 2001), is required. \n \n11. CONCLUSIONS \nThe simulation of an IBGCC+DeCO2 has shown interesting cycle efficiency, 33.94%, with specific \nCO2 emissions of 178 kgCO2\/MWh (with a fixed 80% CO2 removal efficiency). \nIf compared with a similar coal IGCC+DeCO2 (efficiency = 38.8%, specific CO2 emissions = 130 \nkgCO2\/MWh) these results seem to be competitive. A five points efficiency reduction is mainly due \nto the inevitable syngas compression.  \n 22\nLCA methodology application has shown, as an evident result, a negligible contribution to the \noverall environmental impact by plant construction and dismantling, with respect to biomass \nproduction and, especially, to plant operating phase. \nAnother result is the confirmation of a renewable resource (as the biomass) utilisation superiority \nwith respect to coal utilisation, in term of natural resource depletion and avoided greenhouse gas \nemissions. \nThe results concerning the other indicators show values slightly higher than the ICGCC+DeCO2, \ndue to the minor IBGCC+DeCO2 efficiency as well as the non-negligible impact caused by energy \ncrops cultivation. \nFor a more definitive conclusion a more complete methodology is necessary in order to account for \nall the environmental implications of the considered processes. Moreover, a further improvement \nmight result from a better description of the cultivation phase. In fact, literature data on energy \ncrops cultivation are widely incomplete and there are a lot of possible developments. \n \nREFERENCES \nAspenTech. 2001.
