Few studies have quantified environmental effects on the alpha or beta \ndiversity of these communities.

MS No. FACIES-D-08-00008\nReviewer #1\nThis ms is one of the most mature manuscripts I ever had for review. However, as one can read from the \nacknowledgements, obviously this paper already passed one review process that seemingly contributed to \nthe quality of it.\nThere is hardly any criticism I have - only a few minor points:\n1) Abstract: \"the first reported evidence for carbonate mounds in UK waters\" - what\u00b4s about the Darwin \nMounds?\nThe Darwin Mounds are sand mounds colonised preferentially by cold-water corals (Masson et al. \n2003). They are not carbonate mounds in the conventional, albeit poorly defined, sense such as the large \nmound features of the Porcupine Seabight. These coral-built carbonate mounds are now known to have \nformed from successive periods of coral reef framework growth (interglacial) and periods of glacial \nsedimentation. In the title and abstract we now use the term \u2018coral carbonate mound\u2019 to summarise this \npoint. \nWe explain this further in the second paragraph of the Discussion where we insert the following text:\n\u2018The Darwin Mounds reported by Masson et al. (2003) at 1000 m depth in the northern Rockall Trough \nare small sand mounds (up to 75 m diameter and 5 m high) colonised by cold-water corals. Their \nformation is not well understood and was interpreted by Masson et al. as related to fluid escape causing \nsand mounds to form, rather than successive generations of coral reef development that leads to coral-\nbuilt carbonate mounds (Roberts et al. 2006).\u2019\nFinally we note the following text from Masson et al. (2003 p.177)\n\u2018The Darwin mounds are clearly not typical carbonate mounds and it seems certain that they have been \nbuilt by a non-biological process.\u2019\n2) page 3, second paragraph: \"visual survey\": add here ROVs, as these days these instruments provide the \nmost visual surveys on such systems\nWe used the generic term \u2018submersible\u2019 to cover both manned and unmanned submersibles (remotely \noperated vehicles or ROVs). But since this seems to remain unclear we have added \u2018remotely operated \nvehicles\u2019 to this sentence as follows: \u2018Existing information comes from two sources: (1) visual surveys \nbased on video and\/or stills images gathered by drop cameras, manned submersibles or remotely \noperated vehicles and (2) identification of species present in samples recovered from the reef habitat.\u2019\n3) Table 3: There is an order of magnitude increase in the total occurences in the coral\/rock habitats. Does \nthis reflect an enourmous increase in individuals or does this account e.g. for individual polyps of a \nbranch of coral? A little explanation here would be helpful.\nThis question might already show that I do not have a strong (if any) background in the statistical \ndiversity analyses presented in this paper. These, hopefully, can be judged by the second reviewer. Thus, \nwithout assessing this part of the paper, I in general like the ms very much. The approach presented \nprovides a compelling overview over this new \"cold-water coral province\" and can form a baseline study \nfor a number of future investigations in the area.\nThe great increase in occurrences reflects exactly what was recorded. There were very, very many more \noccurrences recorded on coral\/rock habitats and this pattern is then examined statistically. The important \nthing to note in our analysis is that we simplified the dataset to presence\/absence. As explained in the \nMethods \u2018Presence or absence of the megafauna listed in Table 2 were noted from each still image so \nthat a score of one corresponded to one or more occurrences in an image and a score of zero to a taxon \nthat was absent.\u2019 To avoid confusion we have added this phrase to the legend for Table 3: \u2018Subsequent \nanalysis was based on presence\/absence scoring where a score of one corresponded to one or more \noccurrences in an image and a score of zero to a taxon that was absent.\u2019\nauthors' response to reviewers' comments\nClick here to download authors' response to reviewers' comments: Response to referees.doc\nReviewer #2\nDear authors, in my opinion you have produced an interesting interpretation and analysis of a data set of \nvariable quality. Especially the section on biological factors and handling of samples is done very elegant \nand new. \nHowever, some comments remain: in my view you should have included and used the relatively recent \nwork of Due et al (Deep Sea Research) regarding structure of watermasses and effects of current on \nshaping part of Hatton Bank and surroundings, and of Masson et al (2003) regarding the Darwin mounds \nin N Rockall. I therefore question if the statement that this research reports the first carbonate mounds in \nUK waters is correct.\nWe have added reference to Due et al. (2006) at the end of the Introduction. Given the focus of this paper \non habitats, megafaunal diversity and coral mound occurrence we do not feel it appropriate to go into too \nmuch detail on hydrographic regime. We note this at the end of the Introduction as follows:\n\u2018For a recent summary of the oceanographic regime of this region see Due et al. (2006) and references \ntherein.\u2019\nSee earlier response on the issue of the Darwin Mounds.\nIn addition, in your section explaining\/describing effects of currents on moundshape you have not \nincluded Mienis et al (Deep Sea Research 2007) whereas this is one of the few works with highly detailed \nmeasurements of currents at and around mounds, in an adjacent area.\nWe have added reference to this paper at the end of the third paragraph of the discussion, as follows:\n\u2018At the smaller scale of an individual carbonate mound, abundant live coral patches are found in areas \nwith locally enhanced bottom currents, notably on the summit of the Galway Mound (Dorschel et al. \n2007) and on the south western and south eastern margins of Rockall Trough where living coral on \ncarbonate mounds was related to internal waves and tidal currents (Mienis et al. 2007).\u2019\nI feel that the attention paid towards the structure of Hatton and Rockall (geologically) is correct, but that \nthe references should have included Laberg et al Marine and Petroleum Geology (Vol 22) regarding \ngeneral sedimentary structure and setting of the area, as well as Stoker et al (2005) (In Dore and Vining \n(Eds); Petroleum Geology: Northwest Europe and Global perspectives- Proceedings of the 6th World \nPetroleum Geology Conference, pp 1057-1076.\nWe have added reference to both these papers at the start of the Discussion:\n\u2018The general sedimentary structure and setting of the north east Atlantic is discussed by Laberg et al. \n(2005) and Stoker et al. (2005).\u2019\nThis could support your sentence on the effects and changes induced by periods of glacial sedimentation \nof 1-2 million years (discussion p15), although the discussion of Mienis et al (2006) on age and \nsedimentation on carbonate mounds of SW Rockall Trough comprises a better defined estimate of the \nlength of these periods. The conclusion that to date no evidence has been provided for a relationship with \nlight hydrocarbon seepage was already worded in 2003 and was repeated in most, except very few \npublications afterwards. This is not very novel insight and your paper does not need this!\nWe believe it worth re-iterating the point that there is no firm relationship with light hydrocarbon \nseepage because this has been such a major discussion in the literature and the recent work we cite may \nnot be familiar to non-specialists. \nSome notes from me (Andre).\nExcellent manuscript. Could you please delete the chapter and subchapter numerations as we do not \noperate these in FACIES?\nCould you delete the dots after a, b, c, etc in Figs 3,5,and 6\nThese changes have been made.\nOther changes\nWe have added a sentence to the end of the sixth paragraph of the discussion to remove any ambiguity \nover our discussion of the range of Paragorgia arborea: \u2018In the north west Atlantic, P. arborea extends \nfurther south to the Gulf of Maine at approximately 44\u00b0 N (pers. comm.

These corals are typically found on the continental slope and\non offshore banks and seamounts where recent work has shown how they can develop to form large \nreefs and carbonate mounds (Roberts et al. 2006). In the north east Atlantic such structures are \nintimately related to reef frameworks formed primarily by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa\n(Freiwald 2002; Roberts et al. 2003). Here, occurrences of this coral on the continental shelf vary \nfrom small patch reefs, such as those described by Wilson (1979) on Rockall Bank, to the larger \ndeep-water reef complexes characteristic of the Norwegian continental margin (Mortensen et al. \n2001; Freiwald et al. 2002). Over the last decade, deep-water geophysical surveys have revealed \nlarge seabed mounds on the continental slope (Hovland et al. 1994; Kenyon et al. 2003). These are \nnow known to be coral carbonate mounds. They form clusters, or \u2018provinces\u2019, with notable \nexamples in the north east Atlantic from the Porcupine Seabight (De Mol et al. 2002; Huvenne et al.\n2005; Wheeler et al. 2005), southern Rockall Trough (Akhmetzhanov et al. 2003; Kenyon et al. \n2003) and west Africa (Colman et al. 2005). Large deep-water coral accumulations and\n\u2018lithoherms\u2019 have also been reported in the western Atlantic along the Florida-Hatteras Slope \n(Stetson 1962; Neumann 1977), and are now the subject of increased research activity (Reed and\nRoss 2005; Reed et al. 2006; Ross and Quattrini 2007). \nShallow-water coral reefs are renowned for their biodiversity but our understanding of the \nbiodiversity of cold-water coral reefs is limited by their remoteness. Existing information comes \nfrom two sources: (1) visual surveys based on video and\/or stills images gathered by drop cameras, \nmanned submersibles or remotely operated vehicles and (2) identification of species present in \nsamples recovered from the reef habitat. Data from visual surveys are restricted to megafaunal \nanimals large enough to identify in seabed photographs and studies consistently illustrate enhanced \nmegafaunal diversity on-reef versus off (e.g. Mortensen et al. 1995; Jonsson et al. 2004). Similarly, \nstudies of species diversity in samples of reef habitat show high diversities associated with coral \nframework samples (Jensen and Frederiksen 1992) and evidence of characteristic reef species \n(Henry and Roberts 2007). Thus while virtually all reports of cold-water coral reefs and carbonate \nmounds note that these habitats sustain diverse animal communities, most remain descriptive \nstudies that compile lists of species reported from these habitats. For example, Rogers (1999) \ncompiled literature showing 889 species associated with Lophelia pertusa reefs in the north east\nAtlantic, a total that had increased to just over 1300 species following a pan-European research \nproject between 2000 and 2003 (Roberts et al. 2006). Such totals will certainly increase as new \nareas are investigated and new species described (e.g. Henry and Roberts 2007).\nFigure 1\nhere\n4In this study we present geophysical evidence for carbonate mounds and outcropping bedrock on \nHatton Bank and discuss this in terms of previous understanding of the regional geology of this \noffshore bank and its implications in terms of the diversity of substrata that are likely to occur. We \nuse a large archive of seabed photographs taken during a baseline habitat mapping exercise to \ninvestigate whether cold-water coral habitats had quantifiable effects on the alpha and beta diversity \nof communities in a deep-water continental slope setting. For a recent summary of the \noceanographic regime of this region see Due et al. (2006) and references therein. We integrate this \ninformation and consider the importance of understanding small-scale variability in marine habitats, \nits effects on biodiversity and some implications for habitat conservation and the design of deep-\nwater marine reserves. \n5Methods\nThe results described in this paper stem from a series of geophysical and habitat-characterisation \nresearch cruises carried out between 1998 and 2006 that are summarised below. \nGeophysical surveys\nThe single channel data seismic lines presented here were gathered through a joint British \nGeological Survey, oil industry initiative (\u2018Rockall Consortium\u2019) using 2 x 40 and 4 x 40 cubic inch \nairgun arrays, and 1 and 2 kJ sparkers to carry out reconnaissance mapping of the Rockall-Hatton \nregion between 1992 and 2006 (Hatton Bank from 1998). Airgun and sparker profiling was run \nsimultaneously to allow high resolution near surface as well as deeper acoustic penetration. The \nprogramme aimed to establish the structure of the region, the extent of Early Cenozoic igneous \ncover and the thickness and stratigraphy of the post-Eocene sediments. It also identified windows in \nthe basalt cover revealing Mesozoic sediments (Hitchen 2004). The grid of geophysical profiles \nwas established to cover igneous centres identified from gravity and magnetic data as well as giving \na regular spatial distribution (profiles gathered using a Coda acquisition system, CodaOctopus \nProducts Ltd.). Initial shipboard interpretation allowed the inclusion of additional survey lines to \nimprove mapping of selected features. Some surveys also had higher frequency devices that \ncontributed to the interpretation of the seabed morphology such as single and multibeam \nechosounders, and a pinger (Brett and Smith 2000; Jacobs 2006; Smith 2002; 2006).\nVisual surveys\nVisual seabed surveys were conducted over a five day period in late August 2005 as part of \nStrategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) surveys by the UK Department of Trade and Industry\n(since renamed as Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform). Both video and \ndigital still images were recorded using a deep-water camera system (Seatronics DTS 6000 \nincorporating a 5 mega pixel Kongsberg Maritime Ltd OE14-208 digital still camera giving an \noblique view of the seabed) deployed from the SV Kommandor Jack (Offshore Survey and \nEngineering). A series of 13 photographic stations was established on the Hatton Bank (Table 1) \nusing existing British Geological Survey seismic data indicating topographic highs or on the basis \nof newly acquired multibeam bathymetry. The length of individual deployments varied depending \nupon weather conditions and equipment reliability and photographs were taken approximately \nevery two minutes or where distinct changes in habitat were seen. The positions of the photographic \nstations and any intersecting BGS seismic lines are shown in Figure 2. In this paper we describe \nthese photographic surveys and examine the difference in megafaunal species diversity and\ncomposition between macrohabitats. To our knowledge, these are the first in situ reports of benthic \nmegafaunal communities from the Hatton Bank. \nFigure 2\nhere\n6We adopt the clearly defined ecological community terms as outlined by Fauth et al. (1996). Thus a \ncommunity is defined as a \u2018collection of species occurring in the same place at the same time\u2019 and \nassemblages refer to \u2018phylogenetically related groups within a community\u2019. In terms of defining \nhabitat types we adopt the approach described by Greene et al. (1999) where the Hatton Bank can \nbe considered a megahabitat at the scale of kilometres to tens of kilometres. We present geological \nevidence for a variety of mesohabitats at the scale of tens of metres to a kilometre within the areas \nof Hatton Bank surveyed. Finally, we define a series of macrohabitats on the scale of one to tens of \nmetres to investigate the effect of macrohabitat on megafaunal biodiversity.\nOur photographic analysis was based on presence\/absence of megafauna in the still images because \nthe photographs were not standardised to a known area of seafloor. While this prevents abundance \ncounts, it is worth noting that many of the megafauna recorded in these surveys were colonial \nepifauna and it is hard, if not impossible, to discriminate individuals in seafloor photographs. \nPresence or absence of the megafauna listed in Table 2 were noted from each still image so that a \nscore of one corresponded to one or more occurrences in an image and a score of zero to a taxon \nthat was absent. Any images that were obscured by resuspended sediment were excluded from the \nanalysis. Each image was assigned to a dominant macrohabitat, based on the predominant \nsubstratum observed (mud, sand, cobbles, coral rubble, coral framework or rock, Figure 3). In total \n633 images were scored. \nStatistical analyses\nAlpha diversity\nAlpha diversity was estimated as the richness (number) of distinct taxa observed in each image. \nRichness was compared across macrohabitat categories using a one-way analysis of variance \n(ANOVA) with post-hoc multiple comparison tests performed with Bonferroni corrections using \nthe online GraphPad Software (http:\/\/graphpad.com) to identify statistically significant differences \nbetween pairwise macrohabitats.\nBeta diversity of megafaunal communities\nMultivariate ordinations and analyses were performed using PRIMER v6 (Clarke and Gorley 2006). \nSimilarity of percentages (SIMPER) was used to estimate beta diversity and to identify taxa that \ncharacterised each macrohabitat. Beta diversity was estimated as the mean similarity between \ncommunities within each macrohabitat category. Species that contributed most to the overall \nsimilarity of communities within this macrohabitat were then listed. Following this, a triangular \ndissimilarity matrix of pairwise S\u00f6rensen measures based on presence\/absence data was generated \nafter the addition of a dummy variable with a value of one (included to counter cases where images \ncontained no visible megafauna, which would greatly skew similarity estimates). Communities \nacross different macrohabitat types were compared using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), and the \nFigure 3\nhere\n7taxa that contributed most to the dissimilarity across macrohabitats were listed. Variation in beta \ndiversity across macrohabitats was quantified in relation to environmental variables (depth, fine-\nand local-scale substratum) and geo-spatial location (latitude and longitude). Depth is implied here \nto represent a composite factor that could reflect a suite of variables such as current velocity, \nparticle flux and sedimentation. The \u2018fine-scale\u2019 dominant substratum observed in an image was \nscored into a numeric metric as: 1 \u2013 mud, 2 \u2013 sand, 3 \u2013 cobbles, 4 \u2013 coral rubble, 5 \u2013 rock, 6 \u2013 coral \nframework, which roughly followed a gradient of increasing grain size. \u2018Local-scale\u2019 substratum \nwas estimated as the frequency of occurrence of each substratum category in a station. These \nfrequency data were normalized, and the resulting matrix used in a principal components analysis \n(PCA). The resulting axes with eigenvalues > 1 were used to ordinate all stations into a PCA plot \naccording to these scores. The scores from each axis were then used as separate, but related, \nvariables as estimates of local-scale substratum. \nA new environmental\/geo-spatial matrix was created that included log10 transformed depth, \nuniversal transverse mercator (UTM) coordinates in metres, the numeric measure of the fine-scale \nsubstratum and all three scores from the PCA representing local-scale substratum, for each image. \nEnvironmental data were normalized, and the BEST routine was run using the BIOENV method on \nEuclidean distances between the similarity matrices and all available variables. BEST finds the best \nmatch between the species similarity matrix and the environmental\/geo-spatial variable matrix\n(Clarke and Gorley 2006). BEST estimates the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation metric \u03c1, a measure of \nthe degree to which species\u2019 distributions correspond to the environmental and geo-spatial data, and \nits statistical significance. It also identifies the best combination of variables that maximize the \nexplanatory power.\nMegafaunal co-occurrences\nWe investigated the co-occurrences of all megafaunal taxa by calculating S\u00f6rensen measures \nestimated between pairwise combinations of variables i.e., taxa, and ordinating these measures into \na non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plot to visualize the data.\n8Results\nRepresentative images of each macrohabitat and megafaunal taxon are given in Figures 3 and 4 \nrespectively. Here we summarise the characteristics of each station before considering the \nrelationship between megafaunal community and macrohabitat.\nSurvey Stations\nThe seismic profiles across Hatton Bank revealed an irregular topography with local highs several \ntens of metres above the surrounding seafloor (Figure 5). The seismic profiles showed that some of \nthese highs related to the outcropping of acoustic basement (Figures 5b and 5d), interpreted as Late \nPalaeocene igneous rocks, predominantly lava flows. Some highs related to cliffs formed by \ntectonic activity leading to vertical displacement (Figures 5c and 5e). Several compressional events \nhave been noted in the Faroe-Hatton region during the Cenozoic with the major event being intra \nLate Eocene (Johnson et al. 2005). However, some of the topographic highs appeared as \nsedimentary features developed within the Cenozoic post igneous activity (Figure 5f). These were \noften located above topographic changes in the buried igneous surface.\nStation G. This was the deepest of the photographic stations at just over 1 km water depth, on the \neastern flank of Hatton Bank (Figure 2). The seabed surveyed was composed of soft, muddy \nsediments.  One image showed a swept seabed with fractured cover, suggesting that recent \nsediments were not present throughout and that firmer sediments (possibly cemented) were at or \nclose to the seabed. Multibeam surveys showed the flank of Hatton Bank to have numerous hollows \nup to 2 km in diameter. Xenophyophore tests (probably Syringammina fragilissima, see Figure 4 \nimage 28) and echinothurid urchins were the most notable megafauna. No seismic lines intersected\nthis station, although nearby lines indicated that erosion and infill of hollows up to 100 m deep \noccurred on a regular basis. This was reflected in multibeam-derived seabed topography images\nshowing a scalloped surface.\nStation A. This station ranged in depth from 537-591 m. Substrata varied from sandy, shelly \nmaterial through coral rubble, with occasional live colonies of L. pertusa (Figure 4 image 1), to \nexpanses of exposed rock and occasional boulders. Some rocky areas were steeply sloping and \ncolonised in places by scleractinian, gorgonian and antipatharian corals. Coral rubble was \nnoticeably rich in attached epifauna. No seismic lines intersected this station. \nStation K. This station ranged in depth from 740-772 m on the western flank of Hatton Bank and \nthe visual surveys revealed habitats dominated by coral rubble, reef framework and sediment-filled \nreef framework. The coral habitats supported rich epifaunal communities including large \nantipatharian corals (Bathypathes) along with frequent colonies of the smaller characteristically \nspiral-shaped antipatharian Stichopathes (Figure 4 image 9), probably S. gravieri after Molodtsova \nFigure 4\nhere\nFigure 5\nhere\n9(2006). In one of the photographs from this station a large gorgonian coral most likely to be \nParagorgia arborea was seen. The distribution of this species is described by Tendal (1992) and it \nhas not been previously reported from the Rockall Plateau. Station K is located close to seismic line \n00\/01-23 (Figure 2) where acoustic basement assumed to be Palaeocene igneous rock outcrops at \n750 m water depth with small infilled basins of sediments, ~20 m thick (Figure 5b). \nStation L. This station ranged in depth from 645-652 m. Substrata varied between a coarse sandy \nseabed with shelly debris and scattered coral rubble to patches of coral framework. Mobile \nholothurians (Stichopus, probably S. tremulus, see Figure 4 image 16) were common on the sandy \nsediments and the coral framework was colonised by suspension-feeding epifauna. Station L was\nlocated close to seismic line 00\/01-27 (Figure 2) where an acoustically transparent peak occurred\nabove a displacement in the acoustic basement, overlying an acoustically layered unit 40-50 msec \nthick with parallel reflectors. These reflectors and the basement were displaced vertically ~50 msec,\nabove which a ridge-shaped mound 30 m high, 500 m wide and up to 1 km in length was seen \n(Figure 5c) with its axis trending south west-north east following the underlying tectonic geometry. \nA smaller, wider mound occurred upslope but there was no indication that it developed above any \nevidence of displacement.\nStation Q. This station ranged in depth from 622-642 m. Substrata were similar to those seen at \nequivalent depths at Station L with coarse, sandy sediments interspersed with patches of coral \nrubble and reef framework. Echiuran proboscoides were seen extending from burrows in sediment \n(Figure 4 image 25) and some areas of sediment-draped rock were also present. Seismic line 00\/01-\n28 intersected a series of symmetrical sediment wave-like features up to 30 m in height at 1-2 km \nspacing along the survey line (Figure 5e). They occurred above a sub-horizontal reflector that \nrepresented acoustic basement and was interpreted as Late Palaeocene lavas. This reflector showed\na displacement of approximately 50 m beneath one sediment wave about 2 km south west of station\nQ. There were a series of sediment wedges against this vertical displacement suggesting that it was \nexposed as a cliff for a significant period of time. The core of the topographic highs had a chaotic \nacoustic character, which may indicate either that the bedding seen between the highs was too steep \nat the sediment wave or there was a genuine change in physical properties. However the multibeam \nimage (Figure 6c) shows that these are not waves but a series of topographic highs and ridges \nextending southwestwards into deep water on the western flank of Hatton bank.  The largest of \nthese topographic highs was located above the former cliff and so it may be assumed that this \nburied cliff has a similar orientation. The photographic evidence from station Q supported the \ninterpretation of the lack of rocky outcrop and that the mound is an accumulation built up from \ncoral and reworked sediments. \nFigure 6\nhere\n10\nStation C-D. This station ranged in depth from 476-539 m making it the second shallowest station \nsurveyed. The seabed was composed of sandy sediment with frequent, scattered pebbles and larger \nboulders. The latter were heavily colonised by epifauna, notably the stylasterid Pliobothrus\n(probably P. symmetricus, see Figure 4 image 11) and the sessile holothorian Psolus (probably P. \nsquamatus, see Figure 4 image 15). Extensive rocky habitat was also seen including steeply sloping \nrock ledges with crevices and overhangs. Large colonies of antipatharian coral were seen on the \nsloping rock faces (Figure 4 image 10). Scattered coral fragments (L. pertusa) were also evident. A \nsolitary peak with steep sides was located on seismic line 00\/01-38 (Figure 5a) with its \nsouthwestern flank 75 m high and an apparent gradient of 20\u00b0. The cliff was so steep that the \nbottom tracking facility failed to lock as the line was surveyed from southwest to northeast. The \nsubsequent multibeam survey showed the mound was located on a northeast-southwest trending \ncliff (Figure 6a). This cliff may be part of an extensive tectonic displacement as similar features \nwere seen on nearby lines and stations M and P. It is variously orientated northeast-southwest to \neast-west creating a south-facing cliff. In front of the cliff at station C-D is a north east-south west \norientated trough deepening to the south west (Figure 6a). A fan of material up to 40 m thick is \nlocated in the trough at the foot of the mound and appears as a wedge of sediment overlying a \nhorizontal reflector on the seismic record (Figure 5a). The seabed photographs from station C-D \nsuggest the mound bedrock outcrops occasionally, showing evidence of jointing. \nStation M. This station, located 4 km northwest of station C-D, ranged in depth from 514-582 m. \nThe survey revealed areas of coarse sandy habitat with mobile holothurians (probably Stichopus \ntremulus) close to areas of rock, with patchy fine sediment drape. In places the rock sloped steeply \nwith rapid increases in depth noted as the camera frame tracked the bottom. Exposed rock surfaces \nwere frequently colonised by Psolus holothurians and Pliobothrus stylasterids with small patches of \nlive scleractinian framework (L. pertusa). The airgun record close to station M (line 00\/01-01) \nshowed a topographic high within a sequence of easterly dipping reflectors (see Figure 9b in \nHitchen 2004). These were interpreted as landward dipping lava flows extruded along an incipient \nspreading axis at the time of continental break up rather than from one of the volcanic centres noted \nin the area (Hitchen 2004). No sparker record was available due to technical problems when \ncrossing this station. The multibeam image shows that station M is a similar mound to that seen at \nstation C-D though there is little or no evidence for a fan shaped mound of material at the foot of \nthe topographic high.  The photographs from station M show a traverse rising 75 m from the centre \nof the trough to near the top of the high. This may be the site of a tectonic displacement as similar \nfeatures were seen on nearby lines suggesting a north east-south west orientation including stations\nC-D and P creating a south-facing cliff.\nStation R. This station ranged in depth from 518-526 m. The seabed surveyed was predominantly \nrippled sediment with occasional patches of coarser cobble material. Some areas of exposed rock \n11\ncolonised by L. pertusa and other sessile epifauna were seen. No seismic lines intersected this \nstation.\nStation N. This station ranged in depth from 530-650 m. Isolated rocks colonised by sessile \nepifauna were seen with some showing evidence of current scouring pointing to an active near-bed \ncurrent regime. Areas of exposed rock and coral framework were also seen with the latter again \nsupporting a diverse assemblage of suspension-feeders. Transitions between habitats were \nfrequently abrupt indicating the high level of habitat heterogeneity at small scales of between one\nand ten metres. No seismic lines intersected this station.\nStation P. This station ranged in depth from 556-643 m. The survey was dominated by areas of \ncoral reef framework along with expanses of sediment-draped rock and areas of steeply sloping \ncliff-like topography. Large Phelliactis sea anemones were conspicuous colonists on dead coral \nframework (Figure 4 image 12). Profile 06\/02-06 showed that the steeply sloping topography seen \nat station P consisted of outcropping acoustic basement interpreted as part of the igneous suite. The \ncliff face, locally more than 80 m high, is the same tectonic structure seen at stations M and C-D, \n15 and 20 km to the west respectively. At P its strike is oriented approximately east to west (Figure \n6d). The igneous rocks, acoustic basement for the sparker, that comprise the cliff face, dip to the \nnorth and were overlaid by at least two periods of sedimentation (Figure 5f). A well-layered unit \nwas seen below the seabed with an acoustically transparent unit infilling hollows in the igneous \nsurface below. The dip of the well-layered reflectors was interrupted at station S where a moat is \ndeveloped on the upslope (southern) flank of a 30 m high feature (Figure 5f). Multibeam data \ncollected simultaneously with the sparker profile showed the feature to be near conical with a base \narea of 300 x 500 m (Figure 6e). \nStation S. This station ranged in depth from 682-730 m. The visual surveys were taken down the \nflank of a near conical mound (Figure 5f). The sparker profile and multibeam data showed evidence \nof scouring at the base of the southern (the regional upslope) flank of the feature. The mound was \n30 m above the surrounding seafloor, 50 m above the base of the adjacent scoured hollow (Figure \n5f) and 300-500 m in diameter. Seabed substrata varied from coarse sandy material through to coral \nframework and rock. In some areas expanses of sloping rocky topography were evident. The \ninternal structure of this mound was strongly reminiscent of a carbonate mound, similar to features \ndescribed in the Porcupine Seabight (Hovland et al. 1994; De Mol et al. 2002; Huvenne et al. 2005; \nWheeler et al. 2005). Station S appeared to have developed above a topographic change in the \nacoustic basement and grown as acoustically well-layered sediments were deposited on the flank of \nHatton Bank. Sedimentation rates are greatly reduced within the scour zone immediately southeast \nof Station S (Figures 5f and 6e). These sediments were thought to be mid to late Cenozoic in age \nbased on the regional setting.\n12\nStation E-F. This station ranged in depth from 798-855 m. At these greater depths finer, muddy \nsediments were colonised by xenophyophores and ophiuroids (Figure 4 images 28 and 19\nrespectively). Areas with scattered cobbles and larger rocks colonised by sessile epifauna were also \nfound. Expanses of rock were recorded, with some sloping topography and rocky overhangs. No \nseismic lines intersected this station or were within 1 km.\nStation H. This station ranged in depth from 466-482 m. At this the shallowest station surveyed, the \nseabed was predominantly composed of exposed rock or rock with a thin drape of coarse sediments \nand cobbles. Once again, exposed rock was characteristically colonised by the sessile holothurian \nPsolus and stylasterid coral Pliobothrus. No seismic lines intersected this station.\nAlpha diversity\nA total of 34 distinct megafaunal taxa were recorded across the 13 stations. All megafaunal taxa \nrecorded in the visual surveys are listed in Table 2 and sample images are provided in Figure 4. The \nnumber of photographs assigned to each habitat class, total number of taxa and total occurrences \nrecorded by macrohabitat are given in Table 3. Histograms showing the percent occurrence of each \ntaxon by habitat are given in Figure 7. Taxon richness varied across stations, ranging from five taxa \nobserved in station G, to 31 taxa observed in station Q. Stations P, K, N and S were also \nparticularly rich. \nRichness significantly differed across macrohabitat categories (p < 0.05, Table 4). Bonferroni \ncorrected multiple comparisons demonstrated that richness usually differed significantly between \npairwise macrohabitats (p < 0.05, Table 4), but not between rocks and coral rubble, or between the \nmacrohabitat categories corresponding to smaller grain sizes i.e., between cobbles, sand or mud \n(Table 4).\nBeta diversity\nTable 6 summarises average community similarity and thus beta diversity in each macrohabitat and \nlists the taxa that best characterised each category. Muddy macrohabitats were best characterised by \nophiuroids, polychaete feeding tubes and xenophyophores. Sand showed the lowest within \nmacrohabitat similarity and was best characterised by deposit-feeders such as the holothurian \nStichopus and echinoids. However, suspension-feeding taxa were also found in sandy habitats. This \nwas often associated with the presence of hard substrata (cobbles or fragments of coral rubble) in \npredominantly sandy areas reflecting the heterogeneity of substrata at a fine scale. Cobble \nmacrohabitat was best characterised by the stylasterid coral Pliobothrus, encrusting sponges and the \nsuspension-feeding sessile holothurian Psolus. Coral rubble was characterised predominantly by \nsuspension-feeding corals, anemones and sponges but galatheid crustaceans that use the coral \nFigure 7\nhere\n13\nrubble for shelter were also an important and characteristic group. Similarly, coral framework was \nbest characterised by suspension-feeding corals, anemones and sponges. Finally, rock macrohabitat \nsupported the most homogeneous fauna, which were best characterised by the sessile holothurian \nPsolus, encrusting sponges, the stylasterid Pliobothrus, galatheid crustaceans, the antipatharian \ncoral Stichopathes and the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. \nA post-hoc Analysis of Similarities routine (ANOSIM) in PRIMER reported statistically significant \ndifferences in the community composition between most macrohabitats (Table 5). We adopted a \nsomewhat conservative approach to this routine, given the positive relationship between the large \nsample size of images (633) that would necessarily increase the type I error rate. Thus, we \nconsidered ANOSIM test statistic values R > 0.4 with p < 0.001 to represent statistically significant \ndifferences in community composition between macrohabitats. This approach generally restricted \ndifferences to occur between mud and those substrata with coarser grain size i.e., coral rubble, rock \nand framework (R = 0.425, 0.681, 0.793, respectively). It also identified differences in community \ncomposition between coral framework and rocks (R = 0.558), the two largest grain-sized \nmacrohabitats.\nPCA permitted the identification of three components of substrata that could be used to characterise \nlocal-scale substrata. These components cumulatively explained 77.9% of the variation in substrata \nfrequency of occurrence between stations (Table 7, Figure 8). The first PC (explaining 31% of the \nvariation) was most associated with the frequency of occurrence of coral rubble and sand, \ncorresponding to the highest PC scores seen in stations L, Q and K. The second PC (explaining \n26% of the variation) was associated with the frequency of occurrence of cobbles, rock and sand, \nwhich corresponded to the highest PC scores for stations C-D, N and H. The third PC (explaining \n21% of the variation) was associated with the frequency of occurrence of coral framework and \ncobbles, corresponding to the highest PC scores in stations N, P, K. \nBEST measured the highest \u03c1 between the megafaunal community similarity matrix and fine-scale \nsubstratum (\u03c1 = 0.394) when all possible combinations of environmental variables were considered \n(Table 8), including the local-scale substrata scores estimated by PCA. Depth was the next most \ncorrelated variable, but was three times less correlated with the community similarity matrix than\nfine-scale substratum (\u03c1 = 0.129). Therefore, beta diversity in the study area on Hatton Bank varied \ndepending on the fine-scale substratum on which a megafaunal community was found. \nMegafaunal co-occurrences \nUsing the nMDS to illustrate the associations between megafaunal taxa, some of these overall \npatterns are evident (Figure 9). The stylasterid Pliobothrus and sessile holothurian Psolus group \nclosely along with encrusting sponges and serpulid polychaetes. These are all taxa that colonise \nFigure 8\nhere\nFigure 9\nhere\n14\nexposed rock, dropstones and cobbles. Similarly suspension-feeding species typically found with \ncoral reef framework (e.g. Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Phelliactis, Stichopathes) are \ngrouped. On the other hand taxa associated with soft sediments (e.g. bonelliid echiurans, Stichopus, \nxenophyophores) are separated in the nMDS plot. Interestingly taxa commonly recorded in crevices \nin coral reef framework such as the galatheid crustaceans have grouped with characteristic reef \nfauna. While only relatively low numbers of fish were observed (66 observations in total), these \nmobile taxa plot some distance from the tight group of reef-associated suspension-feeders \nsuggesting that the fish observed in this study may not be intimately associated with reef habitat. \nHowever, the effect of the camera frame and lights used in this study on fish behaviour are not \nknown and we are therefore unable to draw any conclusions from this observation. \n15\nDiscussion\nGeological context\nThe general sedimentary structure and setting of the north east Atlantic is discussed by Laberg et al.\n(2005) and Stoker et al. (2005). Much of the Hatton High is composed of thick successions of \nMesozoic (or older) sediments, overlaid by Cenozoic lavas and sediments. This situation contrasts \nwith that at Rockall High where evidence for inversion (relative uplift of previously basinal area) \nsuggests any Mesozoic succession will have been removed and metamorphic basement crops out \nclose to the seabed (Hitchen 2004). The seismic data presented here show that Hatton Bank is in \nsome areas characterised by an irregular topography developed by tectonic displacement exposing \nLate Palaeocene rocks that appear as acoustic basement on sparker profiles (Figure 5d). Other \ntopographic highs appear to be features developed within sedimentary sequences after the Cenozoic \nigneous activity (Figure 5c). The evidence that several of these are carbonate mounds formed by \nsuccessive periods of coral framework growth and sedimentation (Roberts et al. 2006; Williams et \nal. 2006; R\u00fcggeberg et al. 2007) is compelling. Thus the basic geology of the Hatton Bank with \nboth sediments and rock at the seabed, along with the development of carbonate mounds and \nbiogenic reefs of cold-water corals, explain the diverse seabed facies revealed in this study. \nPresent-day coral carbonate mounds on the European continental slope were first reported in the \nmid-1990s by Hovland et al. (1994) and later by Henriet et al. (1998) who hypothesised that they \nwere associated with faults and the seepage of light hydrocarbons. This stimulated intensive \nmapping and further geological investigations (summarised by Wheeler et al. 2007). There is now \nevidence for several carbonate mound provinces in the north east Atlantic from (1) south west\nIreland: the Hovland (Hovland et al. 1994; De Mol et al. 2002), Magellan (Huvenne et al. 2002, \n2007) and Belgica provinces (De Mol et al. 2002; Van Rooij et al. 2003), (2) southern Rockall \nBank: Logachev Mounds (Kenyon et al. 2003; van Weering et al. 2003), (3) western Rockall Bank \n(Wienberg et al. 2008) and (4) north west flanks of Porcupine Bank: Pelagia mounds (Kenyon et al.\n2003; van Weering et al. 2003). The Darwin Mounds reported by Masson et al. (2003) at 1000 m \ndepth in the northern Rockall Trough are small sand mounds (up to 75 m diameter and 5 m high) \ncolonised by cold-water corals. Their formation is not well understood and was interpreted by \nMasson et al. as related to fluid escape causing sand mounds to form, rather than successive \ngenerations of coral reef development that leads to coral-built carbonate mounds (Roberts et al. \n2006). Studies of the stable isotopic composition of coral skeleton and tissue have not supported a \nseep-based food chain (Duineveld et al. 2004) and analyses of lipid biomarkers and stable nitrogen \nisotopes of Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata point to a diet derived from primary \nproductivity at the surface (Kiriakoulakis et al. 2005). Thus to date evidence for a relationship \nbetween coral growth and light hydrocarbon seepage has not been found and the mounds are \nthought to develop through periods of interglacial coral framework growth interspersed with \n16\nperiods of glacial sedimentation over timescales of 1 to 2 million years (Roberts et al. 2006; Kano \net al. 2007). The focussed flow of hydrocarbons supporting microbial communities can lead to \nlocalised hardground or \u2018chemoherm\u2019 formation (Roberts and Aharon 1994) but the origin of the \nhard settlement substratum at the base of carbonate mounds has remained elusive (Huvenne et al. \n2007).\nThe distribution of mounds in the Hatton area is associated with either present day or former sites \nof topographic change. We suggest that currents forced up such features (e.g. cliffs) created \nfavourable conditions that initiated cold-water coral reef development forming a mound that has \ncontinued to grow even if the cliff had subsequently become buried by sediments. It should be \nnoted that these sediments could include carbonate debris derived from the mound. At a larger scale \nthe importance of current regime in shaping carbonate mound development is becoming apparent\nwith evidence that the strongest near-bed current direction correlates with the orientation of mound \nclusters where enhanced diurnal tidal currents have been measured in the east Porcupine Seabight\n(Belgica mounds) and south east Rockall Bank (Logachev mounds) (White et al. 2007). At the \nsmaller scale of an individual carbonate mound, abundant live coral patches are found in areas with \nlocally enhanced bottom currents, notably on the summit of the Galway Mound (Dorschel et al.\n2007) and on the south western and south eastern margins of Rockall Trough where living coral on \ncarbonate mounds was related to internal waves and tidal currents (Mienis et al. 2007). \nMegafaunal biodiversity across macrohabitats\nWhile many recent studies have examined the broad distribution of megafauna in cold-water coral \necosystems, few have taken a quantitative approach to examine the influence of small-scale habitat \nclass on megafaunal communities. The present study benefited from access to a large archive of \nhigh resolution seafloor images from transects that crossed a variety of habitats from mud, sand, \ncobbles and rock to coral rubble and reef framework. Presence\/absence analysis of the megafauna \nrecorded in these photographs revealed clear trends: both alpha and beta diversity varied between \nmacrohabitats, with the richest communities associated with coral-structured (rubble and \nframework) and rocky macrohabitats. Beta diversity was highest in sandy macrohabitats, which was \nlikely related to higher substratum heterogeneity due to the presence of coral rubble and cobbles. \nBeta diversity was lowest on rocks and coral framework, indicating more homogeneous \ncommunities within each of these categories. Beta diversity on Hatton Bank varied accordingly, \nwith differences in fine-scale substratum (i.e., the macrohabitat identified as dominant in each \nimage) explaining nearly 40% of this variation. \nCharacteristic taxa within muddy macrohabitats included xenophyophores. These giant testate \nprotists are likely to have been Syringammina fragillisima, a species recorded in high densities at \n1100 \u2013 1300 m depth on the Scottish continental shelf (Roberts et al. 2000) and at 1000 m depth in \n17\nthe N Rockall Trough (Masson et al. 2003). They are known to provide significant localised \nstructural habitat, altering small-scale community composition (Levin 1991; Gooday et al. 1993;\nHughes and Gooday 2004). Cobble macrohabitats were best characterised by the stylasterid coral \nPliobothrus, the sessile holothorian Psolus and a variety of encrusting sponges. Pliobothrus also \ncharacterised exposed rock macrohabitats, a finding that supports Cairns (1992) overall \ninterpretation of stylasterids as species that are most commonly found on hard substrata off small \nland masses such as oceanic islands, atolls, or on seamounts and ridges where sediment input and \nnutrients are low and salinity varies little. Interestingly Pliobothrus was not seen in either coral \nframework or coral rubble macrohabitats lending further credence to Cairns\u2019 suggestion that \nscleractinian corals, which have far larger polyps and better sediment-shedding abilities than \nstylasterid corals, may out-compete stylasterids. Furthermore, as discussed by Cairns, Ostarello \n(1973) noted that stylsterid planulae tend to settle preferentially on vertical surfaces avoiding the \ndeleterious effects of sedimentation. It is interesting to note that many of the Pliobothrus colonies \nseen in the present study were associated with the steeply sloping, cliff-like facies likely to be \noutcropping Late Palaeocene igneous rocks. \nCoral rubble and coral framework macrohabitats were characterised by abundant suspension-\nfeeding taxa including Stichopathes antipatharian coral, actinians, Lophelia pertusa, crinoids, erect \nsponges, Phelliactis sea anemones, other antipatharians, ophiuroids, octocorals and Madrepora \noculata. It is noteworthy that the occurrence of antipatharian corals was important in discriminating \nbetween macrohabitats (Table 6) even though they are generally regarded as a group largely \nrestricted to more southerly latitudes. Indeed the first reports of Stichopathes and Bathypathes\nspecies north of 52\u00b0 N were only made very recently (Molodtsova 2006). The images of these \nspecies presented in Figure 4 are among the first in situ images available. It is likely that the \nStichopathes species seen in these photographs is S. gravieri (pers. comm. T. N. Molodtsova, \nspecies described by Molodtsova 2006). This study also suggests that the large octocoral \nParagorgia arborea has a wider distribution than previously thought. A single photograph from \nstation K (58\u00b0 44 N) showed an octocoral likely to be P. arborea (enlarged in Figure 10), which \nwould make this the southernmost record of a species generally found north of 60\u00b0 N in the north \neast Atlantic (Tendal, 1992) and the first record from Rockall Plateau. In the northwest Atlantic, P. \narborea extends further south to the Gulf of Maine at approximately 44\u00b0 N (pers. comm. L. \nWatling). \nMacrohabitats dominated by mud and cobbles were characterised by the fewest taxa, with three in \neach case corresponding to 90% of the similarity, followed by rocky macrohabitats with six taxa. \nThe alpha diversity of coral rubble and framework macrohabitats was reinforced by the higher \nnumbers of characterising taxa, 11 and 12 respectively. Higher similarity (and thus lower beta \ndiversity) between samples from reef framework versus off-reef samples was also reported on the \nFigure 10\nhere\n18\ncarbonate mounds of the Porcupine Seabight (Henry and Roberts 2007) and might relate to the \ngreater spatial \u2018predictability\u2019 over a horizontal area of well-developed reef. Sandy macrohabitats \nwere characterised by a greater number of taxa (12), but recall that the low percentage similarity \nwithin this category (and thus the higher beta diversity) reflects the heterogeneity of this habitat, \nwhich was frequently mixed with small patches of hard substrata in the form of cobbles or isolated \npatches of rock and\/or coral. \nVariation in the alpha and beta diversity of megafauna observed over the various stations and \nmacrohabitats on Hatton Bank suggest that species turnover should closely relate to environmental \ngradients in this area. Future work on the megafaunal communities on Hatton Bank, and other \ncomparable banks and seamounts, could integrate textural results from geophysical surveys (e.g. \nmultibeam and sidescan sonar) and local-scale hydrographic data to generate an even wider suite of \nenvironmental variables to more tractably partition the variation in community composition \namongst variables such as substratum, current speed and aspects of habitat complexity. Beta \ndiversity may also be a significant influence on total diversity across marine habitats. This was \nrecently demonstrated in shallow-waters by Hewitt et al. (2005) who found that small biogenic shell \ndebris patches significantly affected beta diversity by enhancing and maintaining biodiversity on \nsoft sediments in a New Zealand marine reserve.\nThis study demonstrated that alpha and beta diversity varies significantly across macrohabitats on \nHatton Bank, and that there is a degree of predictability in the taxa associated with each \nmacrohabitat. It is also clear that seamounts and offshore banks such as Hatton Bank support a \ndiverse range of habitats from relatively quiescent fine sediment areas to submarine cliffs, exposed \nrock and coral reef framework. Habitats may vary and change across small spatial scales with \nconcomitant change in megafaunal assemblages but further work to quantify the beta diversity of \noffshore banks and seamounts is needed. In addition to wide-area seismic and bathymetric survey \nand small-scale photographic survey intermediate scale mapping using both multibeam backscatter \nanalysis and high resolution sidescan sonar will prove valuable. This spatial variability should be \nconsidered in the design of offshore marine conservation areas. Recent years have seen growing \nconcern over the damage emergent deep-water benthic communities can suffer from bottom trawl \nfishing prompting the United Nations General Assembly to call upon member states to close \nvulnerable marine ecosystems, including seamounts, hydrothermal vents and cold-water corals to \nbottom fishing where they are known or are likely to occur, based on the best available scientific \ninformation (Davies et al. 2007). Thus while there is now a clear consensus that bottom trawling in \nvulnerable, long-lived ecosystems such as cold-water coral reefs is unsustainable, society lacks a \nclear indication of where these ecosystems are found and how they are linked in terms of genetic \ndispersal and biogeography. Without this information, offshore reserve design becomes simply a \nmatter of designating features that happen to have been discovered and surveyed. The United \n19\nNations use of the word \u2018likely\u2019 is significant here since it puts a clear emphasis on the \nprecautionary principle and indicates that the likelihood of a vulnerable ecosystem\u2019s occurrence is \nsufficient to merit protection. There is clear need to develop our ecological understanding of these \nhabitats in terms of their distribution, connectivity and beta diversity so that predictive models of \ntheir occurrence can be used to inform reserve design.\nAcknowledgements\nThe images analysed in this study were collected by the UK Department of Trade and Industry\n(now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) as part of Strategic \nEnvironmental Assessment of area 7 (\u2018SEA7\u2019) carried out before licensing hydrocarbon exploration \n(see http:\/\/www.offshore-sea.org.uk\/).

Regional \nsetting of this area is shown in Figure 1. Isobaths taken from GEBCO represent generalised \ninterpretation of the bathymetry. The recent SEA surveys indicate that the seafloor is considerably \nmore complex and there are differences of more than 100 m in some places. For correct station depths \nrefer to Table 1. \nFigure 3\nPhotographs of macrohabitat categories with descriptions of fauna present in each image. \na. Mud with many ophiuroids, a xenophyophore (probably Syrangammina fragilissima) and a cut-\nthroat eel (Synaphobranchus kaupi). Scour formed around perimeter of xenophyophore test suggests \nactive near bed current regime (799 m depth).\nb. Sand with shell debris and fragments of coral rubble. Sparse fauna with brachiopod and mobile \nholothurian (Stichopus) visible (646 m depth).\nc. Cobble with many small stones and sparse coral rubble. Stones colonised by encrusting sponges and \nstylasterid coral (Pliobothrus) (650 m depth).\nd. Rock apparently steeply sloping with sizeable colony of antipatharian coral (probably Leiopathes), \nstylasterid corals (Pliobothrus), holothurians (Psolus squamatus) and large Phelliactis anemone. \nFissures in rock contain galatheid crustaceans (508 m depth). \ne. Coral framework with live Lophelia pertusa. Epifauna include large Phelliactis, yellow gorgonian, \nhydroids, seafan gorgonians, antipatharians, corkscrew-shaped antipatharians (Stichopathes) and \nunidentified anemones. Decapod crustaceans and prawns also visible (633 m depth).\nf. Coral rubble with encrusting blue sponge, Cidaris urchin and galatheids (642 m depth).\nFigure 4\nPhotographs illustrating the megafaunal categories listed in Table 2.
