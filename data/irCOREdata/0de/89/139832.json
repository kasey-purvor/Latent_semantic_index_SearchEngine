Sequencing of their 16S rRNA gene along with presence of the katA gene 31 \ndemonstrated dominance of the LAB microbiota by Leuconostoc spp. during aerobic storage 32 \nat 5, 10 and 15\u00b0C, as well as during MAP (-) and MAP (+) storage at 10 and 15\u00b0C; 33 \nLactobacillus sakei prevailed during aerobic storage at 0\u00b0C, as well as at MAP (-) and MAP 34 \n(+) storage at 0 and 5\u00b0 C. The sporadic presence of other species such as Leuconostoc 35 \nmesenteroides, Weisella viridescens,  Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus curvatus has also 36 \nbeen determined. Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis of high molecular weight genomic DNA 37 \nrevealed the dynamics of the isolated LAB strains. Prevalence of Leuconostoc spp. was 38 \nattributed to one strain only. On the other hand, packaging conditions affected Lb. sakei strain 39 \nspoilage dynamics.  40 \n 41 \n 42 \n 43 \n 44 \n 45 \nKey words; Lactic acid bacteria, meat preservation, PFGE, essential oils, microbial ecology 46 \n 47 \n 48 \n 49 \n 50 \n 3 \n \nINTRODUCTION 51 \nFood spoilage microbiota has been the subject of several studies conducted so far; the 52 \nones focused on meat and meat products were based on the identification and\/or 53 \ncharacterization of the dominant microbiota at different storage conditions. The concept of 54 \n\u2018succession\u2019 of spoilage-related microbial groups i.e. ephemeral \/ specific spoilage organisms 55 \n(E\/SSO), was only recently, taken into consideration (Ercolini et al. 2006; Chenoll et al. 56 \n2007; Nychas et al. 2008).  57 \nLactic acid bacteria (LAB) for instance are considered to be the Specific Spoilage 58 \nOrganisms (SSO) that contribute to the meat spoilage stored under packaging conditions in 59 \nwhich the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased (Axelsson 1998; Holzapfel 1998; 60 \nNychas and Skandamis 2005). Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Carnobacterium are among 61 \nthe most frequently encountered genera on vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged meat 62 \nand play an important role in the spoilage of refrigerated raw meat (Shaw and Harding 1984; 63 \nDainty and Mackey 1992; Hugas et al. 1993; McMullen and Stiles 1993; Rovira et al. 1997; 64 \nHolzapfel 1998; Labadie 1999; Parente et al. 2001; Nychas and Skandamis 2005). Species of 65 \nLeuconostoc sp. and Lb. sakei have been associated with the spoilage of vacuum or modified 66 \natmosphere packed meat stored at chill temperatures (Champomier \u2013 Verges et al., 2001; 67 \nYost and Nattress 2002; Ercolini et al. 2006). The lack of consistency e.g. why these two 68 \nspecies were not always found at the end of storage period even if the conditions were similar 69 \ncan be possibly attributed not only to the limitation of the applied methodologies used but 70 \nalso to the potential effect of the man imposed preservation system on the development of the 71 \nmicrobial association, e.g., Ephemeral Spoilage Organism (Stanbridge and Davies 1998; 72 \nNychas et al. 2008; Vasilopoulos et al., 2010). In this case the word \u2018ephemeral\u2019 does 73 \ndescribe the situation where these specific spoilage bacteria contribute to meat spoilage for a 74 \nvery short period of time till the next climax population is established. The identification and 75 \n 4 \n \ncharacterization of these ESOs in raw meat under different storage conditions remains still to 76 \nbe elucidated (Jones 2004; Ercolini 2006, 2009; Fontana 2006; Vasilopoulos et al. 2010).  77 \n  Oregano essential oil, as a potential `hurdle', was found to affect the contribution of 78 \nspoilage microorganisms to the microbial association as well as to the physico-chemical 79 \nchanges of the minced meat (Skandamis and Nychas 2001, Burt 2004). Skandamis and 80 \nNychas (2002) that reported the oregano essential oil effect on microbial population, 81 \nincluding LAB, on active packaging conditions. Axelsson (1998) concluded that the addition 82 \nof oregano essential oil influenced the metabolic activity of LAB. More specifically, the 83 \ninitial heterofermentative microbiota was substituted by an homofermentative one at the end 84 \nof storage. However, despite the antimicrobial action of essential oil on biota, there is less 85 \ninformation about the effect of such compounds on the microbial diversity of the LAB 86 \nisolated from meat at species and strain level. The only information available relates the 87 \nessential oil effect on growth of meat spoilage bacteria such as Lb. sakei, Lb. curvatus and 88 \nCarnobacterium piscicola (Ouattara et al. 1997). 89 \n The use of conventional phenotypic methods does not always allow efficient 90 \ncharacterization of the microbiota at species level (Holzapfel 1998; Stanbridge and Davies 91 \n1998). On the contrary, molecular identification and characterization tools are far more 92 \nconsistent, rapid, reliable and reproducible and can discriminate even between closely related 93 \ngroups of species, which are otherwise indistinguishable on the basis of their phenotype. The 94 \nadvances in molecular techniques are expected to widen the knowledge of spoilage-related 95 \nbacterial succession during storage of foods (Chenoll et al. 2003; Ercolini et al. 2006). 96 \nSeveral molecular typing techniques have been developed during the past decade for the 97 \nidentification and classification of bacteria at strain level. Among them, Pulsed-Field Gel 98 \nElectrophoresis (PFGE) of DNA fragments resulting from the digestion of whole genomic 99 \nDNAs with rare-cutting restriction endonucleases has proved to be reliable for bacterial 100 \n 5 \n \ntyping. This method has been used to differentiate members of several genera including 101 \nLactococcus (Tanskanen et al. 1990), Clostridia (Hiel et al. 1998), Streptomyces (Leblond et 102 \nal. 1990), probiotic lactobacilli (Yeung et al. 2004), and to compare the genomic restriction 103 \npatterns of five Bifidobacterium breve strains (Bourget et al. 1993). It is considered to be a 104 \ndiscriminating and reproducible method to differentiate strains of intestinal bacteria (O\u2019 105 \nSullivan 1999) and for chromosome size estimation in Lb. acidophilus (Roussel et al. 1993, 106 \nSanders et al. 1996), Lb. plantarum (Daniel 1995), and other LAB (Tanskanen et al. 1990). 107 \nFurthermore, PFGE in association with PCR-based methods are commonly used for strain 108 \nmonitoring (Singh et al. 2009). 109 \n The aim of the present study was to systematically monitor the microbial diversity of 110 \nLAB, isolated from meat stored at different temperatures and under different packaging e.g. 111 \naerobic or MAP conditions, at strain level, by using modern molecular tools. 112 \n 113 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 114 \nSample preparation and storage conditions. Minced beef was purchased from the central 115 \nmarket of Athens and prepared according to Argyri et al. (submitted for publication). Briefly, 116 \nminced beef samples were stored at 0, 5, 10 and 15oC, aerobically or under modified 117 \natmospheres packaging (MAP) consisting of 40% CO2 - 30% O2 - 30% N2 with MAP (+) or 118 \nwithout MAP (-) the application of volatile compounds of oregano essential oil (2% v\/w). 119 \nThe samples were placed on Styrofoam trays; all trays were performed to allow the diffusion 120 \nof the volatile compounds of the essential oil with both side of the samples. In the case of the 121 \ntreated samples (MAP +), the essential oil was distributed on a whatman paper that was 122 \nplaced on the bottom side of the tray. 123 \n  124 \n 6 \n \nSampling of the meat. Minced beef was sampled at appropriate time intervals, depending on 125 \nstorage temperature; the incubation lasted 650, 482, 386 and 220 hours at 0, 5, 10 and 15oC, 126 \nrespectively and all samples were analysed in dublicate. A detailed description of the 127 \nmethodology employed for the enumeration of the total viable counts, Pseudomonas spp., Br. 128 \nthermosphacta, LAB, Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts and molds in this work is presented 129 \nelsewhere (Argyri et al. submitted for publication). Briefly, LAB counts were determined on 130 \n\u039cRS agar (Biolife, Italiana S.r.l., Milano, Italy) (pH = 5.8) overlaid with the same medium 131 \nand incubated at 30 \u02daC for 72 h. LAB were isolated from the highest dilution from three 132 \ndifferent time points (initial, middle and final stage of storage) for further analysis; 10% of 133 \nthe colonies (6 to 10 colonies) derived from plate culture of the highest sample dilution. They 134 \nwere randomly selected  and purified by successive subculture on MRS agar at 30\u00b0C. Gram 135 \npositive, catalase and oxidase negative isolates were stored at -80\u02daC in MRS broth (Biolife, 136 \nMilano, Italy) supplemented with 20% (v\/v) glycerol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) until 137 \nfurther use. Before experimental use each strain was grown twice in MRS broth at 30\u00b0C for 138 \n24 and 16h respectively. Purity of the culture was always checked on MRS agar plates before 139 \nuse. 140 \n 141 \nPulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). PFGE was performed according to Kagkli et al. 142 \n(2007). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 5 min and washed 143 \nwith 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1 M NaCl; resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of the same 144 \nsolution, heated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min and mixed with an equal volume of 2% (w\/v) low 145 \nmelting-point agarose (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in 0.125 M EDTA pH 7.6 before 146 \nletting them to solidify in moulds (Bio-Rad). The cells were lysed in situ in a solution 147 \ncontaining 10 mg mL-1 of lysozyme in EC buffer (6 mM Tris-HCl, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM 148 \nEDTA, 1% (w\/v) Sarkosyl, pH 7.6) for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. The lytic treatment was repeated with 149 \n 7 \n \nthe same solution containing 2U mL-1 mutanolysin. After treatment with proteinase K (0.5\u039c 150 \nEDTA containing 1% sarkosyl, pH 8) for 24h at 55\u00b0C, the agarose blocks were washed twice 151 \nfor 1 h with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing 1 152 \nmM EDTA, (pH 8.0) at 37\u00b0C and then stored at 4\u00b0C in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing 100 mM 153 \nEDTA (pH 8.0) until further use. 154 \nThe agarose blocks were cut with sterile coverslips and slices (1 - 2 mm thick) of the 155 \nblocks were washed three times at room temperature in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing 0.1 mM 156 \nEDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min with gentle agitation. The restriction enzymes ApaI and SmaI 157 \n(10U) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were initially selected to digest the slices 158 \nof a limited number of strains. The enzyme that resulted in the production of clearer and 159 \nsharper PFGE digestion profile was used for the digestion of all isolates. Digestions were 160 \nperformed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. 161 \nFollowing digestion, slices were loaded into wells of a 1% PFGE grade agarose gel (Bio-162 \nRad) and the gel was run in 0.5 mM Tris-Borate buffer (45 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 45 mM Boric acid, 163 \n1 mM EDTA) using a CHEF-DRII PFGE apparatus and cooling module (Bio-Rad) at 6 Volt 164 \ncm-1 for 16h, with a pulse time ramped from 1 to 10s. Gels were then stained with ethidium 165 \nbromide (0.5 \u00b5g ml-1) in water for 1 h and destained for 2 h before being photographed using 166 \na GelDoc system (Bio-Rad). Conversion, normalization and further analysis were performed 167 \nusing the Pearson coefficient and UPGMA cluster analysis with Gel compare software, 168 \nversion 4.0 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium; kindly provided by E. 169 \nTsakalidou, Dairy Laboratory, Agricultural University of Athens). 170 \n 171 \nDNA extraction and species identification. DNA was extracted according to the 172 \nprotocol described by the manufacturer of GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma, 173 \nChemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. USA). Representative number of isolates per distinct PFGE 174 \n 8 \n \ncluster were selected and subjected to species identification by sequencing the V1-V3 175 \nvariable region of the 16S rRNA gene as described previously (Paramithiotis et al. 2008). 176 \nPCR products were purified using the QIAquick\u00ae PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 177 \nGermany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and directly sequenced with an ABI 178 \n3730 XL automatic DNA sequencer by Macrogen (http:\/\/www.macrogen.com). The results 179 \nwere aligned with those in GenBank using the BLASTN program in order to determine their 180 \nclosest known relatives of the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (Altschul et al. 1997). The 181 \nGenBank\/EMBL\/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S-rRNA gene sequences are GU998850 182 \nto GU998881 (Table 2). 183 \n 184 \nDetection of the heme - dependent catalase (katA) gene. All isolates were screened by 185 \nPCR for the presence of the katA gene, encoding heme-dependent catalase (Knauf et al. 186 \n1992; Hertel et al. 1998). For this purpose the specific primers 702-F (5\u2019-187 \nAATTGCCTTCTTCCGTGTA-3\u2019, position 551\u2013536) and 310-R (5\u2019-188 \nAGTTGCGCACAATTATTTTC-3\u2019, position 127\u2013139) were used.  189 \n 190 \n 191 \nRESULTS 192 \n 193 \nLAB were found to be the dominant biota in samples stored under MAP 194 \nsupplemented (+) or not (-) with Essential Oil (EO) (results not shown \u2013 Argyri et al. 195 \nsubmitted for publication). Table 1 summarizes the lactic acid bacterial counts of the initial 196 \nbiota and of the three different time points (initial, middle and final stage of storage) for each 197 \nof the storage conditions tested. In case of samples stored under MAP (+), the counts of LAB 198 \nwere lower at two times points (middle, end) than the ones stored in air and under MAP (-). 199 \n 9 \n \nA total of 266 LAB isolates were recovered throughout the storage period; 99 isolates 200 \nfrom aerobic storage, 89 isolates from MAP (-) and 78 isolates from MAP (+).  The 99 201 \nisolates from aerobic storage were subjected to PFGE to determine the strain diversity during 202 \nstorage. For the aforementioned isolates, high molecular weight genomic DNA was digested 203 \nwith two different restriction enzymes (ApaI and SmaI). ApaI restriction generated better 204 \ndistributed bands than SmaI allowing a more reliable analysis of the generated profiles (Fig 205 \n1). Therefore, ApaI was chosen to digest the 89 and 78 isolates from minced beef stored 206 \nunder MAP (-) and MAP (+), respectively.  207 \nA large diversity regarding strain occurrence at the different packaging and 208 \ntemperature conditions was revealed (Fig 1, Table 3). The dendrogram obtained after image 209 \nanalysis of the different PFGE patterns, resulted into 32 different profiles, nine of which were 210 \nobtained from aerobic storage, while 15 and 17 from MAP (-) and MAP (+), respectively 211 \n(Table 3). Each strain present in Figure 1 was subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 212 \nStrains B 225, B 251, B 226, B 236, B 248, B 253, B 228, B 237, B 229, B 255, B 227, B 213 \n239, B 230, B 238, B 250, B 252, B 254 and B 249 were assigned to Lb. sakei; strains B 245 214 \nand B 246 to Lb. curvatus; strain B 247 to Lb. casei-group; strains B 234 and B 235 to Ws. 215 \nviridescens; strains B 242 and B 243 to Ln. mesenteroides-group and strains B 232, B 241, B 216 \n258, B 244, B 233, B 240 and B 231 to Leuconostoc spp. All isolates were also screened for 217 \nthe presence of the katA gene, specific for Lb. sakei. The katA amplification results were in 218 \naccordance with the ones already described. Two fingerprints (B 232 and B 233 assigned to 219 \nLeuconostoc spp.) were common for all packaging conditions, two (B 226 and B 227 220 \nassigned to Lb. sakei) were shared between air and MAP (-), one fingerprint (B 230 assigned 221 \nto Lb. sakei) was shared between air and MAP (+), and two fingerprints (B 242 and B 243 222 \nassigned to Ln. mesenteroides) were shared between MAP (-) and MAP (+). 223 \n 10 \n \nFrom the initial stage of storage, two different strains (B 232 and B 233) were 224 \nrecovered, which were assigned to Leuconostoc spp. Strain B 233 was the most common 225 \nisolate, since it was recovered at a percentage of 83.33% of the isolates recovered from the 226 \ninitial stage of storage. 227 \nFrom the 99 isolates from the aerobic storage of minced beef, the largest group was 228 \nattributed to Leuconostoc spp. The corresponding fingerprints were B 231, B 232 and B 233 , 229 \nwith the latter being the most common isolate, representing the dominant biota during storage 230 \nat 5, 10 and 15\u00b0C. The rest of the fingerprints (B 225, B 226, B 227, B 228, B 229 and B 230) 231 \nwere attributed to Lb. sakei, which were recovered from 0 and 5\u00b0C, but one (B 228) from 232 \n10\u00b0C. At 0\u00b0C, Lb. sakei (B 226) was the prevalent one at the final stage of storage. The 233 \nfrequency of isolation and prevalence of the aforementioned  isolates obtained from minced 234 \nbeef regarding aerobic storage at 0, 5, 10 and 15\u00b0C is shown in Table 3. 235 \nFifteen different fingerprints were detected during storage of minced beef under MAP 236 \n(-); they were assigned to Lb. sakei (B 226, B 227, B 236, B 237, B 238 and B 239), 237 \nLeuconostoc spp. (B 232, B233, B 258, B 240 and B 241), Ws. viridescens (B 234 and B 238 \n235), and Ln. mesenteroides (B 242 and B 243).  Table 3 presents the frequency of isolation 239 \nand prevalence of the isolates regarding the storage temperature. At 10 and 15\u00b0C, 240 \nLeuconostoc spp. (B 233) represented the dominant biota, whilst Ws. viridescens (B 234), Lb. 241 \nsakei (B 237), Ln. mesenteroides (B 243) and Leuconostoc spp. (B 240) were also recovered. 242 \nAt chill temperatures (0 and 5\u00b0C), the strain diversity was increased, since 11 different 243 \nfingerprints were recovered. In both temperatures, Lb. sakei (B 237) was the prevalent strain 244 \nat the final stage of storage. Moreover, Lb. sakei (B 236, B 238 and B 239), and Leuconostoc 245 \nspp. (B 233 and B 258) were also recovered from storage at 0\u00b0C, whilst Ws. viridescens (B 246 \n235), Lb. sakei (B 226, B 238 and B 227), Leuconostoc spp. (B 233 and B 241) and Ln. 247 \nmesenteroides (B 242) were recovered from storage at 5\u00b0C. 248 \n 11 \n \nOut of 78 isolates, seventeen different fingerprints were obtained during storage of 249 \nminced beef under MAP (+), indicating the increased diversity of the isolates. The frequency 250 \nof isolation and prevalence of these isolates regarding storage at 0, 5, 10 and 15\u00b0C is shown 251 \nin Table 3. At 10 and 15\u00b0C, Leuconostoc spp. (B 233) was the most common isolate, 252 \nrepresenting the dominant strain, whilst Lb. sakei (B 252 and B 255) and Ln. mesenteroides 253 \n(B 243) were also recovered. Lb. sakei (B 254) was the dominant strain at the final stage of 254 \nstorage at 5\u00b0C, while Lb. sakei (B 248 and B 255),  and Leuconostoc spp. (B 233 and B 244) 255 \nwere also recovered during the storage at 5\u00b0C. At the final stage of storage at 0\u00b0C, 256 \nLeuconostoc spp. (B 233), Ln. mesenteroides (B 242), Lb. curvatus (B 246) and Lb. sakei (B 257 \n249 and  B 251) were equally contributed. Lb. curvatus (B 245), Lb. casei and Lb. sakei (B 258 \n248, B 250 and B 253) were also recovered during storage at 0\u00b0C.   259 \n 260 \nDISCUSSION 261 \n 262 \nSpoilage and spoilage progress of meat and meat products have been the subject of 263 \nseveral studies conducted so far (Borch et al. 1996; Stanbridge and Davies 1998; Labadie 264 \n1999; Skandamis and Nychas 2002; Nychas and Skandamis 2005; Nychas et al. 2008). 265 \nNevertheless, meat spoilage has only been associated with the physicochemical and 266 \nmicrobiological analysis of the bacterial loads ignoring the spoilage potential of a specific 267 \nbacterial species or strain (Skandamis and Nychas 2002). Only recently did research took into 268 \nconsideration the specific characteristics of  the  spoilage microbiota of the meat products and 269 \nits contribution to the deterioration of the product (Cocolin et al. 2004; Rantsiou et al. 2005; 270 \nErcolini et al. 2006, 2009; Vasilopoulos et al. 2010).  271 \nThe present study focused on the evaluation of the microbial diversity of LAB 272 \nisolated from minced beef stored under different storage conditions at strain level. Storage 273 \n 12 \n \nconditions had an important effect on the diversity of the microbial population, since different 274 \nstrains were recovered during the storage of meat under different conditions. These findings 275 \nstrengthen the opinion that the storage temperature and the modified atmosphere packaging 276 \naffect the spoilage potential of LAB (Stanbringe and Davies 1998; Ercolini et al. 2006, 2009). 277 \nMoreover, this observation can be explained by the fact that different metabolic activities 278 \noccur when different species\/strains are present and when meat is stored under specific 279 \nconditions. Not all species belonging to the same bacterial group, e.g., LAB, necessarily grow 280 \nat the same temperature. It might therefore be misleading the fact that selective media only 281 \nare used for the determination of the spoilage biota. Further characterization of the isolates 282 \ngrown on the selective plates should be demanded if a better insight and understanding of the 283 \nphenomenon is required. This is in accordance with the observations of Ercolini et al, (2006) 284 \nwho reported that different species \/ strains were isolated from beef although similar counts 285 \nwere determined. Ercolini et al. (2006) also mentioned that the viable counts alone may not 286 \nbe enough to highlight the shifts of the bacterial communities depending on the 287 \nenvironmental changes and species that are actually involved in meat spoilage. 288 \nAmong the species listed in Table 2, several meat associated ones were identified. 289 \nHolzapfel (1998) reported that more rarely Lb. plantarum and Lb. casei are associated with 290 \nmeat systems and in lower frequency and numbers than Lb. curvatus and Lb. sakei; the 291 \npresence of Ws. viridescens in raw meat has been also described. Moreover, Lb. curvatus, Lb. 292 \nsakei and Leuconostoc spp. have been found to indicate a mixture community of vacuum 293 \npacked (vp) beef (Yost and Nattress 2002). Leuconostocs have been identified as 294 \npredominant organisms in beef stored under vp\/MAP (Stanbringe and Davis 1998; Yost and 295 \nNattress 2002) and their presence in the initial mesophilic bacterial microbiota is very 296 \nfrequent (Borch et al. 1996). Lb. sakei has been associated with fresh meat (Champomier \u2013 297 \nVerges et al. 2001) as well as spoilage of a variety of meat products both under vacuum and 298 \n 13 \n \nmodified atmosphere packaging (Ercolini et al. 2006, 2009) and it is known to be among the 299 \nmost psychrotrophic lactobacilli. It has also been found to be the dominant spoilage LAB 300 \nduring storage at chill temperatures (Ercolini et al. 2006; Chenoll et al. 2007). 301 \nPFGE has also provided important information in relation to the strain distribution of 302 \nthe LAB population which would have not been acquired if strain typing had not been 303 \nperformed. Within the LAB population of the present study, Leuconostoc spp. and Lb. sakei 304 \nwere identified as significant members of the microbiota at abuse and chill temperatures, 305 \nrespectively. More accurately, Leuconostoc spp. (B 233) that was initially present at high 306 \nlevels, dominated eventually the microbiota of the minced beef stored at abuse temperatures 307 \nat all packaging conditions. Although, it was persistent throughout storage at chill 308 \ntemperatures, Lb. sakei strains dominated the LAB population only at the final stage of 309 \nstorage. However, some degree of microbial variability was detected at the final stage of 310 \nstorage of meat at chill temperatures, since different Lb. sakei strains were the most prevalent 311 \nones at the different packaging conditions. Indeed, Lb. sakei (B 226), (B 237) and (B 245) 312 \ndominated the LAB population at 0\u00b0C under aerobic conditions, at 0 and 5\u00b0C under MAP (-) 313 \nand at 5\u00b0C under MAP (+).  This finding is of great importance since it shows the 314 \nintraspecies variability of Lb. sakei and the ability of certain strains to adapt to the different 315 \nstorage conditions outgrowing the other.  316 \nDominance of Leuconostoc spp. at relatively higher temperatures can be partially 317 \nattributed to the favourable environmental conditions and partially to the shorter generation 318 \ntime (Harris 1998), both of which enabled it to outgrow Lb. sakei strains which were indeed 319 \ndetected as a secondary microbiota. On the other hand, dominance of Lb. sakei strains at chill 320 \ntemperatures can be attributed partly to its psychrotrophic nature. 321 \nFrom the different LAB detected throughout the storage under MAP (-) and MAP (+), 322 \na wide range of strains were sporadically present, especially at chill temperatures. This 323 \n 14 \n \nfinding indicates that modified atmosphere packaging resulted in a development of a totally 324 \ndifferent spoilage ecosystem. It has been previously reported (Jay 2000), that during storage 325 \nof meat under MAP, the initial heterofermentative microbiota was substituted by a 326 \nhomofermentative one at the end of storage. Moreover, the MAP and the presumed activity of 327 \noregano essential oil against heterofermentative LAB species (Axelsson 1998) seem to have 328 \nprovided the latter with an ecological advantage over leuconostocs.  329 \nThe findings of the present study were based on the culture-dependent approach, most 330 \nfrequently applied when storage studies are performed. Selective media have been used for 331 \nisolation and subsequent characterisation of the microbiota; stressed or injured cells might not 332 \nhave managed to recover and grow, resulting in their non isolation from the plates and giving 333 \ntherefore the impression that they were absence from the system under investigation. A bias 334 \nis therefore inserted which could have an effect on the description of the microbial 335 \ncommunity present. Except from the factors mentioned above, random selection of colonies 336 \nis required to have a representative sample. This is not always possible because it depends on 337 \nthe person performing the task and it is therefore not objective. 338 \nA culture-independent approach could have been an alternative to the plates used for 339 \nthe characterization of the different microbiota (Cocolin et al. 2004). Nevertheless, even this 340 \napproach has drawbacks which lie in the fact that species have to be above the detection limit 341 \n(104 cfu g-1) and very frequently, the dominant species prevents evidence of the less abundant 342 \nones. Primer affinity to the target has also an effect on the amplification and therefore on the 343 \nspecies identified. In order to clarify possible discrepancies between culture-dependent and 344 \nindependent methods, and to evaluate whether these differences would give a different 345 \noverview of the ecology of the meat stored at the conditions mentioned, a similar study could 346 \nbe performed applying both approaches in the future. This investigation lies beyond the scope 347 \nof the present study, which was actually focused on elucidating the effect of the different 348 \n 15 \n \nstorage conditions with or without the presence of essential oil on the dynamics of LAB 349 \nstrains. 350 \nThe present study did provide an insight of the population dynamics of LAB strains in 351 \nrelation to the temperature and the packaging conditions. It has been clearly demonstrated 352 \nthat certain species and\/or strains are present or dominant only under certain conditions. This 353 \nfinding is extremely important since studies conducted so far had only taken into 354 \nconsideration the microbiological counts as an indication of the spoilage process, and had 355 \nignored the possibility that different species or strains would prevail under different storage 356 \nand\/or packaging conditions. The qualitative information derived from the microbiological 357 \nanalyses and the characterization of the species or even the strains present were not evaluated 358 \npreviously. It has been shown that storage temperature combined with packaging conditions 359 \ninduced the selectivity of the spoilage LAB microbiota. Moreover, the microbiota recovered 360 \nfrom the initial stage of storage was markedly different from that of the final stage of storage 361 \nat chill temperatures. The above observations are of great importance and, to our opinion, 362 \nfundamental in understanding the spoilage process and in explaining the presence of different 363 \nproducts or by-products that occur during the different dynamic storage conditions 364 \n(Skandamis and Nychas 2002).  365 \n 366 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 367 \n 368 \nThis work was partly supported by 2 EU Projects ProSafeBeef ((Ref.
