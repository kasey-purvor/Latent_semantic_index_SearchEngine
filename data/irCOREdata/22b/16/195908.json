We propose that copper-\nbinding-and\/or chaperoning proteins, especially MTs, are potential therapeutic targets \nfor HD. \n  \nIntroduction \nHuntington\u2019s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal \npolyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the 350kDa protein, huntingtin (htt). HD is \nassociated with intracellular aggregates (or inclusion bodies, IB) and neuronal loss, \npredominantly occurring in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Posttranslational \nmodifications and cleavage of htt occur in vivo and the resulting N-terminal htt \nfragments containing the polyQ stretch are prone to misfolding and aggregation [1].  \nThis misfolding and\/or aggregation likely leads to a toxic gain of function, although \nloss of normal htt function, which has been implicated to participate in a variety of \ncellular functions, may also play a role during disease. Many cellular dysfunctions \nhave been identified that could participate in the disease process including impaired \ntranscription, mitochondrial abnormalities, dysregulation of the cellular redox-\nhomeostasis and deficits in protein degradation pathways, axonal transport and \nsynaptic function (for a recent review see [2]).   \nBoth iron and copper accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) of HD mouse \nmodels and in the HD brain [3, 4] and could play a role in the above-mentioned \ncellular alterations that occur in HD. Indeed, several recent findings point to the \nimportance of copper in HD. Clioquinol, a copper\/iron-chelator, significantly delays \nneuropathology in HD mice [5] and N-terminal htt binds copper in vitro and in vivo \n[4].  Htt has also been shown to reduce copper (II) and increase aggregation of the \nfull-length wild-type (non-expanded) htt protein of mice [4].  The reduction of copper \nand concomitant increase in oligomerisation has also been demonstrated for beta-\namyloid and is suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease [6, \n7]. Copper is crucial for electron transfer reactions in a number of enzymes involved \nin activities such as antioxidant defence and neurotransmitter biosynthesis. Despite \nthis essential requirement for copper, an excess of this heavy metal is toxic, primarily \ndue to its reactivity with molecular oxygen which leads to formation of reactive \noxygen species (ROS). Therefore the transport and compartmentalisation of copper is \nhighly regulated, involving copper transporters and chaperones (see Table 1). By \nexamining published gene expression data from HD cell and mouse models and \nhuman HD brain tissue we found that copper-binding\/chaperoning proteins, including \nmetallothioneins (MTs), were consistently up-regulated (Table 1). This could reflect a \nprotective response against increased copper and ROS and\/or a disruption of copper \nhomeostasis more generally. This observation led us to test whether overexpression of \ncopper-regulating genes in yeast and mammalian cell models of HD reduce htt \ntoxicity. Because oligomerisation and the production of amyloid-like structures of N-\nterminal htt has been tightly linked to cellular toxicity [8-11] we have also \ninvestigated whether copper modulates the formation of such protein assemblies using \natomic force microscopy and biochemical assays and tested if increased expression of \ncopper-binding proteins reduces htt aggregation. \nMaterials and methods \n \nProtein purification and Atomic force microscopy \npGEX-HD53\/20Q plasmids were kindly provided by Paul Muchowski (Gladstone \nInstitute of Neurological Disease, University of California, San Francisco) and \nhttEx1-GST was prepared as described previously [12, 13] .  The integrity of the \nprotein was validated using SDS-PAGE.  The protein was dialysed in 20mM Tris-HCl \npH8, 150mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 5% glycerol.  Freshly prepared protein samples \nwere used for each experiment performed at 4\u00b0C. 10\u00b5M CuCl2 was added prior to the \naddition of PreScission protease (GE Healthcare 2 units\/100 \u00b5g protein) to 50\u00b5M \nGSThtt-Q20 or -Q53 to initiate GST cleavage. 24 hours after addition of PreScission \nprotease and\/or CuCl2, 5\u00b5l (12\u00b5g protein) of the reaction was spotted onto a freshly \ncleaved mica disc (Agar Scientific) incubated for 2 minutes and then rinsed with \n200\u00b5l ultrapure water and dried with compressed air.  The samples were imaged in air \nwith a digital multimode Nanoscope III AFM (www.veeco.com) operating in tapping \nmode with an uncoated silicon tip (FM-W, Nanoworld Innovative Technologies, \nSwitzerland). \n   \nCell culture, DNA transfection and Adenovirus infection \nHeLa cells (Sigma) were grown in 4500mg\/ml DMEM (Sigma) with 100 units\/ml \npenicillin\/streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C, \n10% CO2.  For transfection, 150000 HeLa cells per well were plated in 6 well \nplates\/35mm dishes and exposed to 2 \u00b5g of human MT3 DNA (Origene, SC123646) \nand 4\u00b5l lipofectamine (Invitrogen) per well for 5 hours (24 hours after seeding) in \nserum-free medium (OPTI-MEM, Invitrogen), after which culture medium was \nadded. 24 hours later cells were trypsinised and re-plated in 96 well plates.   \nAlternatively cells were treated with CuCl2 or clioquinol for 24 hours in 6 well plates \nbefore being re-plated into 96 well plates. Before re-plating, equal numbers of cells \nwere infected in suspension at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with an \nadenovirus expressing httEx1 containing either 25 or 97 glutamines fused to \nmonomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) at the httEx1 C-terminus. Then cells were \ncultured for a further 48 hours in the presence\/absence of CuCl2 or clioquinol where \nappropriate after which an MTS assay was performed according to standard protocols \n(Promega) using a FLUOStar OPTIMA plate-reader (BMG Labtech) at an absorbance \nwavelength of 490nm. Cells were fixed subsequently for IB analysis. Overexpression \nof MT3 was verified by western blotting (data not shown).   \n \nDot blot and Western Blot analysis \nCell lysis, SDS-PAGE, preparation of samples for dot blots and Western Blots were \nperformed as described previously [14].  Dot blot samples, normalised for total \nprotein content, were filtered on a Bio-Rad dot blot filtration unit through a cellulose \nacetate membrane with a 0.2 \u00b5m pore size (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) that was pre-\nequilibrated with 2% SDS.  HttEx1 was detected using a sheep anti-httEx1 antibody at \na concentration of 1:6000 (S830, a kind gift from Gillian Bates, Kings College, \nLondon) followed by a secondary anti-sheep HRP antibody and ECL detection \n(Amersham). MT-3 was detected on a Western blot using an anti-mouse MT3 \nantibody (MO1, Abnova, Taiwan), followed by a secondary anti-mouse HRP \nantibody and ECL detection.   \n \nOverexpression of copper-modulating genes in yeast  \nYeast strains containing plasmids for the overexpression of selected genes were \nobtained from the Yeast ORF Collection (Open Biosystems). The relevant yeast \nstrains were grown overnight in 96 well plates containing 100\u00b5l of selective media \nsupplemented with 2% glucose  per well and transformed with either p425GALL-\nhtt25Q-GFP or p425GALL-htt103Q-GFP using a high throughput transformation \nmethod [15]. The constructs p425GALL-htt25Q-GFP and p425GALL-htt103Q-GFP \nwere generated by amplifying the huntingtin constructs from pYES2-htt25Q-GFP and \npYES2-htt103Q-GFP [16] and cloning them into the SpeI and XhoI sites of \np425GALL [17]. Both htt103Q and htt25Q are galactose (GAL)-inducible, FLAG- \nand GFP-tagged constructs encoding the first 17 amino acids of htt fused to a polyQ \ntract. Transformants were grown to stationary phase selective media containing 2% \nglucose, serial diluted, and spotted onto selective media supplemented with either 2% \nglucose or 2% galactose and 2% raffinose. Plates were incubated at 30\u02daC for 3-5 days \nand yeast strains scored for growth. \n \nStatistical analysis \nPairwise comparisons were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t test and 95% (*) or \n99% (**) confidence intervals were used for calculating significance.  The number of \nexperiments performed for each result is indicated in the figure legend.   \n \nResults \n \nWe used an in vitro model of huntingtin aggregation involving purification of a GST \nfusion protein of exon 1 of htt (httEx1) followed by cleavage of the GST tag, which \ninduces a time-dependent aggregation of httEx1 [8, 18].  Cleavage of the GST moiety \nfrom httEx1-Q20 did not lead to any detectable aggregation, but imaging of samples \nof httEx1-Q53 by atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed amyloid-like fibrillar \nstructures (Figure1A). Addition of 10\u00b5M CuCl2 significantly accelerated the \nproduction of httEx1 fibrillar structures (Figure 1A). An increase in aggregation due \nto addition of CuCl2 to purified httEx1-Q53 was also demonstrated using a filter trap \nassay, which detects SDS-insoluble material produced by httEx1 (Figure 1B). \n  \nDue to the observed effect of copper on aggregation of httEx1 protein in vitro, we \nhypothesised that alterations in copper metabolism would affect aggregation and \ntoxicity induced by expression of httEx1 in vivo.  Therefore we tested the ability of \noverexpression of several yeast genes known to be involved in copper homeostasis to \nrescue httEx1-mediated toxicity (see Table 1).   Figure 2 shows that all seven copper \nbinding genes tested provided some degree of rescue against expanded polyQ toxicity.  \nBecause one of the most effective genes in rescuing toxicity was CRS5, a yeast \nhomolog of metallothionein (MT), we chose this protein to test its effects on polyQ \naggregation and toxicity in a mammalian cell culture model of httEx1. \n \nWe first established that increased copper concentrations also increased httEx1 \naggregation in vivo and whether clioquinol, as shown previously [5], was able to \nreduce aggregation. Equal expression and transgene integrity of httEx1-Q25\/97 fused \nto mRFP was verified by Western Blotting (data not shown). Figure 3A shows that \nwhilst additional copper enhances aggregation of HttEx1-Q97, clioquinol reduces \naggregation of HttEx1-Q97 in a dose dependent manner. Copper similarly increased \naggregation in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) expressing httEx1-Q97 (data not \nshown). Copper did not induce polyQ aggregation of httEx1-Q25 which does not \nnormally aggregate when overexpressed at similar levels to httEx1 with a polyQ \nexpansion [14, 19-22]. Clioquinol reduced httEx1 toxicity and copper increased \ntoxicity in both httEx1-Q25 and Q97 expressing cells (at the concentrations of 10 and \n100 \u00b5M tested) (data not shown). We next overexpressed human MT3 DNA for 24 \nhours before infection with the httEx1 adenoviruses. We chose MT3 because, in \ncontrast to other MT isoforms, it is mainly expressed in the central nervous system \nand therefore is likely to be the most relevant isoform for potentially modulating HD \nphenotypes. As seen in Figure 3B, httEx1-Q97 induced significant toxicity as \ncompared to httEx1-Q25, reducing MTS activity by ca. 25% after 48 hours of \nexpression. Notably, co-expression of MT3 was protective, and restored more than \n50% of the MTS activity lost due to httEx1-Q97 toxicity. In parallel with reduced \nlevels of toxicity, MT3 overexpression significantly reduced inclusion body formation \n(Figure 3C) and the production of SDS-insoluble material in cells expressing httEx1-\nQ97 (Figure 3D).  \n   \nDiscussion \n \nOur results show that altering levels of copper either by addition of exogenous copper, \naddition of a copper chelator or over-expression of copper homeostatic genes affects \naggregation and\/or toxicity of an aggregation-prone N-terminal fragment of htt. \nCopper could directly participate in HD pathogenesis by increasing aggregation of htt \nand\/or by altering brain energy metabolism (e.g. LDH metabolism is altered in mouse \nHD brain) [4]. However, it should be noted that some of the copper-homeostatic \nproteins tested in yeast also regulate iron metabolism and therefore some htt toxicity \nmodifying genes in our analysis may be linked to iron metabolism. Copper \nmetabolism is highly regulated and, although a chelation approach with clioquinol and \ntetrathiomolybdate has been partly successful in reducing pathology in an HD mouse \nmodel [5, 23], a more targeted approach to restore copper homeostasis may provide \nfurther and more consistent improvement with fewer side effects, which is particularly \nimportant for long-term treatment. \n \nMTs could provide such a missing link. In our study, two yeast MT homologs, Crs5 \nand Cup1-2, suppress toxicity in a yeast model of mutant htt toxicity, with Crs5 \nshowing the most significant rescue of the genes tested. In addition, one of the \nmammalian homologs of this yeast gene, MT3, was also protective against htt toxicity \nin HeLa cells. MTs are a family of low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins \nwhich bind not only bind copper, but also zinc and heavy metals [24]. MTs are \nbelieved to have antioxidant properties due to their multiple sulfhydryl groups, which \ninteract with ROS. Past studies have shown that MT3 over-expression protects against \nH2O2 \u2013induced oxidative stress [25]. Under stress conditions, including oxidative \nstress, the metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF-1) activates expression of MTs \nvia metal-response elements (MREs) present in their promoter regions. In support of a \nneuroprotective effect of MTs, addition of Zn (II) to cultured neurons causes an up-\nregulation of MTs and a correlated increase in survival of dopaminergic neurons [26]. \nIn addition, the neuroprotective drug resveratrol (neuroprotective in HD models, [27]) \nwas also shown to up-regulate MTs [28]. How MT3 protects against polyQ toxicity is \nnot clear, but it is likely linked to either the copper-binding ability of this protein or its \ngeneral antioxidant actions, or both. Indeed we have previously shown that expression \nof a mutant htt fragment is associated with an increase in cellular ROS production in \nboth yeast and mammalian cells [20, 29], but it is unknown how increased ROS are \nproduced. Copper could be involved in ROS production by modulating httEx1 \naggregation and\/or directly participate in Fenton-type reactions leading to \nbiomolecular damage due to oxidative stress. Therefore, the metal binding and \nantioxidant properties of MTs make these proteins good candidates for therapeutically \ntargeting HD, especially given the importance of oxidative stress in HD (reviewed in \n[2, 30]) and the likely importance of copper in htt aggregation\/toxicity as shown in \nour study and in experiments performed by Fox and colleagues [4]. This critical study \nshowed that copper binds to histidine 82 and 98 in a 171 amino acid N-terminal \nfragment of htt. It is therefore possible that direct interactions of copper with httEx1 \n(which contains histidine 82) may affect the oligomerisation properties of this protein \nand subsequent fibril formation and thereby impact on the production of toxic \nintermediate protein species. This hypothesis remains to be tested in the future using \ncopper-binding deficient htt fragments. \n \nIn summary, we have shown that copper increases polyQ aggregation in vitro and in \nvivo and that overexpression of MTs protects against polyQ toxicity in two cellular \nHD model systems. Given the importance of MTs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease [31-35] and \nother chronic CNS diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [36, 37] and \nParkinson\u2019s Disease [38-43], we propose that MTs are excellent candidate therapeutic \ntargets for HD. \n \nAcknowledgement \nThe Wyttenbach lab would like to thank the Medical Research Council (MRC), \nBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), and the Gerald \nKerkut Trust.

No \nsignificant aggregation was seen for httEx1-Q20, whilst fibrillar structures were \nevident for the httEx1-Q53 reaction and the number of fibrillar structures per 10 \u00b5m2 \narea increased in the presence of CuCl2\n \nB) Dot blot of SDS-insoluble httEx1-Q53 recombinant protein, generated using a \nfilter trap assay, probed with the S830 anti-httEx1 antibody (kindly provided by G. \nBates, King\u2019s College, London). No insoluble material was detected for httEx1-Q20 \n(data not shown).  Incubation of httEx1-Q53 in the presence of 10 \u00b5M CuCl2 \nmarkedly increases the amount of insoluble material at all time points.   \n \nFigure 2 \n \nParental wild-type Y258 yeast containing constructs for overexpression of the \nindicated yeast ORFs were transformed with p425-Htt25Q or p425-Htt103Q and \ncellular viability determined using growth assays [16]. The expression of both the \nhuntingtin constructs and the indicated yeast ORFs is induced by galactose. Five-fold \nserial dilutions of stationary phase cultures starting with an equal number of cells of \nrepresentative suppressor genes are shown. Expression of htt-Q103 induces \nsignificant toxicity compared to expression of htt-Q25. Overexpression of copper-\nhomeostatic genes (see Table 1 for details) shows a significant rescue effect towards \nhtt-Q103 toxicity (Cox23 and Ccc2 not shown). This growth assay was performed \ntwice with identical results. \n \nFigure 3  \n \nA) Percentage of HeLa cells expressing httEx1-Q97mRFP containing an inclusion \nbody (IB) when left untreated or when treated with clioquinol or CuCl2 (mean, +\/- SE, \nn=3). The addition of CuCl2 significantly increases the percentage of cells containing \nan IB, whilst the presence of clioquinol at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M, causes a modest \ndecrease in percentage of cells containing an IB. \n \nB) MTS absorbance measured at 490nm for HeLa cells expressing httEx1-\nQ25\/Q97mRFP for 48 hours (mean +\/- SE, n=3).  Expression of httEx1-Q97 induced \ntoxicity, demonstrated by a 23% +\/- 2% reduction in MTS absorbance.  Co-\nexpression of MT3 ameliorated this toxicity by 60% +\/- 5%. \n \nC) Percentage of HeLa cells expressing httEx1-Q97mRFP containing an inclusion \nbody (IB) when transfected with an empty vector or with MT3 (mean +\/- SE, n=4).  \nCo-expression of MT3 significantly reduces the percentage of cells containing an IB.  \nMT3 expression was verified by Western blotting (data not shown).   \n   \nD) Dot blot of SDS-insoluble material extracted from HeLa cells expressing httEx1-\nQ97mRFP protein using a filter trap assay, probed with an anti-httEx1 antibody \n(S830).  1x and 0.5x indicate the relative amount of pellet loaded. No insoluble \nmaterial was detected for cells expressing httEx1-Q25 as shown previously ([14, 22], \ndata not shown). Cells co-expressing MT3 produced significantly less SDS-insoluble \nmaterial, compared to empty vector transfected control cells (quantified in right \ngraph) (mean +\/- SD, n=2).   \n \n \nReferences \n \n1 DiFiglia, M., Sapp, E., Chase, K.
