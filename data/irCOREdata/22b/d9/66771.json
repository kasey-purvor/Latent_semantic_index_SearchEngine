The economy of this region \nbeen transformed from a booming core in the nineteenth century to a \nmarginalised and near-bust periphery by the end of the twentieth century, \nwhile the region has been blighted by widespread poverty and inequality \nthroughout this long period. The principal question that this paper addresses, \ntherefore, is this: how are the long periods of continuity, punctuated by \noccasional major shifts, in developmental trajectory and the region\u201fs place in \nthe global economy, allied to the persistence in socio-spatial inequalities \nwithin the region,1 to be understood? \n \nIn the nineteenth century, the north east was one of the birth places of \nindustrial capitalism, a new industrial region materially and discursively \nconstructed in a space that was formerly largely occupied by a pre-capitalist \nand non-industrial economy and society. It became a veritable \u201eworkshop of \nthe world\u201f, at the core of capitalist production, the British Empire and an \nemerging nineteenth century globalising economy, built around coal, iron and \nsteel, engineering (notably shipbuilding, armaments, and railways) and \nchemicals. Now it is an \u201cold\u201d industrial region, with very little remaining of the \ngrowth industries of the nineteenth century. To use the adjectives \u201cold\u201d and \n 3 \n\u201cnew\u201d in relation to industrial regions is simply to acknowledge that the nature \nof capitalism ensures that all industries at some point become \"old\u201d, as, in a \nsense, do the regions in which they are \u2013 or were  - embedded. \n \nThe extent and pace of decline in the last quarter of the twentieth century was \nnonetheless spectacular. As a result, and in strong contrast to the nineteenth \ncentury, the north east is now a profoundly deindustrialised region on the \nperiphery of the European Union and on the margins of the global economy. It \nis very largely disconnected from the decisive circuits of capital and the major \ngrowth mechanisms of the contemporary capitalist economy. As a result, not \nonly have the \u201cold\u201d industries largely disappeared but there has been at best a \npartial and weak \u201cre-industrialisation\u201d via the endogenous growth of \u201cnew\u201d \nindustries or the introduction of \u201cold\u201d industries (such as automobile or \nconsumer electronics production) that are \u201cnew\u201d to the north east. \n \nIn short, the north east has experienced a long wave of growth followed by \ndecline (Mandel, 1978), although with cyclical fluctuations around this long \nterm trend. Throughout, however, the region has been characterised by deep \nintra-regional socio-spatial inequality (for example, in terms of incomes, \nwealth, health and living conditions). This was the case from the boom years \nof the nineteenth century to the profound economic decline that set in during \nthe last quarter of the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century north east \nEngland was and now still is a region marked by intra-regional inequalities as \nnineteenth century liberalism was echoed by late twentieth century neo-\n                                                                                                                                            \n1\n The re-invigorated debate as to how best to conceptualise \u201ethe region\u201f is summarised in \n 4 \nliberalism in national politics and the dominant conception of the national \npolitical economy.  Intra-regional socio-spatial inequality has remained a \nconstant characteristic in its trajectory of growth and decline.  \n \nSeeking to explain the region\u201fs particular sequence of growth and decline, \ncombined to persistent intra-regional inequality, requires drawing upon a \nvariety of theoretical perspectives.  A critical insight of Marxian political-\neconomy is that uneven development, including spatially uneven \ndevelopment, is structurally embedded within the capitalist mode of \nproduction (CMP) and economies dominated by it. It stresses that uneven \ndevelopment is, as it were, genetically encoded into the CMP. This \nemphasises the broader structural determination of regional uneven \ndevelopment and contextualises the possibilities for regional autonomy and \npro-activity. However, while such a highly abstract approach can identify key \ncausal mechanisms and the necessary structural relations that define the \nCMP as capitalist, it cannot reveal which regions will grow and prosper, which \nwill decline. Nor can it reveal which fractions of the classes of capital and \nlabour, in which regions, will \u201ewin\u201f and \u201elose\u201f as an integral part of the \ndynamism of such processes.  \n \nA further related limitation of such a structural analysis is that it cannot \nuncover how the strategies and practices of capital, states, and workers \ncombine in complex ways to create regions that become critical nodes in the \naccumulation process and regions that become marginal to it. Equally, and \n                                                                                                                                            \nHudson, 2001, Chapter 9, and Hudson, 2003a. \n 5 \ncritically, it cannot reveal the mechanisms through which regions change from \nbeing focal points in processes of growth to locations that are eviscerated by \nthe flight of capital and abandonment by the (national) state as it ceases to \nregard them as locations for productive activity. Such regions are \ncharacterised by a \u201esurplus population\u201f, at best of direct interest to capital or \nstate as a source of migrant labour that could move elsewhere in search of \nwork and meet labour-power demands in other regions. Nonetheless, these \nare regions that require regulation and surveillance, and forms of state \ninvolvement to ensure the reproduction of a population there, not least for \nreasons of political legitimacy.  \n \nAnswering such questions about the changing developmental trajectories of \nregions requires a different type of approach to that of Marxian political \neconomy, drawing on theories grounded in other complementary strands of \nheterodox social science that seek to reveal the mechanisms, \u201emessy \npractices\u201f and emergent effects through which capitalist economies are \nperformed and (un)intentionally (re)produced. In particular, I want to draw on \nstrands of evolutionary and institutional approaches and upon state theory \nand concepts of governance and governmentality to seek to deepen \nunderstanding of the production of \u201eold industrial regions\u201f. I seek to use these \nas three inter-related and to a degree overlapping perspectives through which \nto examine and seek to interpret the socio-economic development of north \neast England. As such, there is a deliberate selectivity in choice of evidence.  \n \n 6 \nI am not therefore seeking to give a comprehensive account of the region\u201fs \ndevelopment and historical geography. My aim is both more focused and \nlimited: that is, to explore the extent to which continuity and change in the \nregion\u201fs developmental trajectory can be understood in terms of evolutionary \nand institutional concepts and the varying engagement of the state with issues \nof socio-economic development and change. This has important practical as \nwell as theoretical implications. Not least, how does the state seek to deal \nwith such regional economic problems and legitimate its activities? What is \nthe capacity of the state to manage the maintenance of or changes in \ndevelopmental trajectories? Should state policies seek to maintain existing \ndevelopmental trajectories or seek to move regional economies onto new and \ndifferent ones?  \n \nPath dependency or path contingency? \n \nOne way of seeking to understand the changing trajectories of regional growth \nand decline is to draw upon strands of evolutionary thinking, especially \nevolutionary approaches in economics that eschew biological analogy and \nemphasise that path dependence is socially constituted (Metcalfe, 1998). As \nsuch, path dependence is grounded in the reproduction of instituted forms of \nbehaviour (which are discussed in the following section). Concepts of path \ndependency are undoubtedly useful in accounting for the long period of \nsecular growth in the economy of north east England. This lasted from the \nearly nineteenth century to the 1920s, albeit punctuated by sharp cyclical \nmovements characteristic of the capitalist business cycle in an economy \n 7 \ndominated by a liberal mode of regulation that allowed markets great scope \nas resource allocation mechanisms. The booming regional economy was \ndominated by a small number of major conglomerates (or \u201ecoal combines\u201f: \nsee Hudson, 1989, after Harvey, 1917), linked via a range of untraded as well \nas traded inter-dependencies (which are discussed more fully in the next \nsection) that forged connections between them.  \n \nRapid regional economic growth was therefore based upon close and \nmutually reinforcing links of intra-regional traded dependencies between the \nmining of coal and the production of iron and steel, and a wide range of \nengineering products manufactured from iron and steel (armaments, ships, \nrailways and so on), and chemicals. Markets for these booming industries \nwere often constituted as international, rather than simply national, markets \nfrom the outset. Such markets were constructed within the political \nframeworks of both the formal and informal British Empires, the latter \nconstituted by areas of the world that were not under formal UK political rule \nbut in which UK based capital held a dominant position. For example, \ncompanies based in north east England had an iron grip on the market for \nconstructing railways over much of south America. The combination of \ncontinuously growing markets and close inter-connections between the inputs \nto and outputs from production processes in the north east created a virtuous \nspiral of path dependent growth. This served the interests of the owners of \ncapital and of the coal combines in the region well for around a century. \n \n 8 \nIf, however, this was a successful and path dependent trajectory of growth, \nthe conditions on which it relied were contingent and conjunctural, albeit \nrelatively stable over a long period. As such, the concept of path contingency \ncaptures the character of the growth process, and in particular the transition \nfrom growth to decline, more adequately than that of path dependency (see \nHardy, 2002; Hudson, 2003b). There are a number of issues of particular \nsignificance in this context. The first is the collapse of markets, both national \nand international, for commodities produced in the north east. The second is \nthe transition from a liberal to an interventionist mode of regulation of the \nregional economy, shaped by dominant capitalist interests in the region. The \nthird is the shift from a social democratic politics of nationalisation and state \nownership of key industries in a state managed region from the mid-1940s to \nmid-1970s (Hudson, 1989) to a subsequent neo-liberal politics of privatisation \nand pre- and post-privatisation rationalisation.  \n \nThe secular collapse of international markets for many of the industrial \ncommodities produced in north east England began in the depression of the \n1920s and 1930s. As a result, whole swathes of industry in the region \ncollapsed and in some cases this led to the permanent destruction of \nproductive capacity. For example, in shipbuilding there was a state-sponsored \nstrategy to cut capacity (Wilkenson, 1939) while in coal mining the cessation \nof pumping activities from the mines led to permanent closure due to flooding, \nespecially in south west Durham (Dalton, 1953).  By and large, however, it \ninvolved mass unemployment rather than the mass destruction of industrial \ncapacity.   \n 9 \n \nThe scale and persistence of unemployment was sufficient to generate \npolitical concerns and at the same time the owners of capital in the region \nbegan to seek new ways of promoting and protecting their interests. One \nresult of this was the invention for the first time, albeit haltingly and \nuncertainly, of a nascent national government regional policy from the late \n1920s. This emergent policy concern registered that regional uneven \ndevelopment had ceased to be simply an undesirable characteristic of \ncapitalist development and had become a political problem for the state. \nProminent capitalists in the north east, coming together as the self-styled \nNorthern Industrial Group, took an active role in seeking to construct this \npolicy in ways that served their own interests, relying on their political power \nto do so, and became key figures in the new regional institutions established \nto develop and implement it (Hudson, 2004). Re-armament in the 1930s and \nthen the war-time economy (1939-45) restored effective demand for many \nindustrial commodities produced in the region and the post-war settlement \ninvolved the nationalisation of industries that formed key sectors of the \nregional economy (coal mining, iron and steel and the railways). While the \nnationalisation of iron and steel was short-lived, it was subsequently re-\nnationalised in the 1960s while shipbuilding was nationalised in the 1970s. \n \nThese various nationalisations were informed by a variety of motives, \ndepending on their specific timings (Hudson, 1986). Generally, however, \nnationalisation reflected the fact that industries seen in various ways as \ncentral to national or regional economic performance or national interests \n 10 \n(notably in terms of defence) were no longer sufficiently profitable to attract \nthe required investment in fixed assets and means of production by private \ncapital. Public ownership via nationalisation in this way became a strategy to \nunderpin the region\u201fs development trajectory around these industries, as the \nstate replaced private capital as the proximate guarantor of the region\u201fs path \ndependent developmental strategy. It did so, however, in ways that created a \ntrajectory locked-in to existing industries. For example, the newly created \nNational Coal Board was confined to the mining of coal and legally prevented \nfrom diversifying into activities such as the manufacture of mining machinery \nand equipment \u2013 activities that remained a source of profit for other private \nsector companies (Grundy Warr, 1989). Thus this shift to the state as \nguarantor of the regional development trajectory, and of selected private \nsector interests, was politically negotiated on terms that were very favourable \nto the latter. For some it created captive markets while for others it was a \nmeans to liberate capital from obsolete and unprofitable fixed assets. In \npractice, nationalisation became a mechanism to restore capital to a money \nform that private sector companies could use to diversify their interests, \nspatially and sectorally. \n \nNonetheless, those industries that were nationalised continued to decline \nwithin the north east. There were two main sets of reasons for this. First \nchanges in the international division of labour as a consequence of the \nemergence of new centres of production for coal, steel and ships (as well as \nindustries such as chemicals that remained in private ownership) in other \nparts of the world. Secondly, technological developments led to the creation of \n 11 \nalternatives to coal as an energy resource and raw material for carbon-based \nchemicals production, and to plastics and other materials as alternatives to \nsteel as an industrial material. Continuing decline in the regional economy led \nto further policy responses from the state. One response, informed by political \nconcerns over socio-spatial equity and maintaining the legitimacy of state \ninvolvement in economy and society in the region, was that national \ngovernments strengthened their regional policies to try and attract new private \nsector investment. Initially, this was typically in the form of branch plants in \nmanufacturing and their analogous workplaces in both private and public \nservice sector activities. However, while there was diversification of industries \nand sectors, there was homogenisation in terms of stage of production and \nlocation in value chains, with a proliferation of low skill, low value-added \nactivities. These factories were \u201cglobal outposts\u201d (Beynon and Austrin, 1978), \nlocated at the end of corporate chains of command and control that stretched \nacross the globe.  As the limits to these policies became visible over a \nnumber of decades, the emphasis switched more to the formation and growth \nof indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 again without \nconspicuous success (Robinson and Storey, 1981; Storey, 1982).  \n \nFrom the mid-1970s the UK state faced growing fiscal pressures, with fears of \na fiscal crisis of the state triggering capital flight from the national territory. In \nresponse, the scope and extent of state involvement in economy and society \nbegan to rein back as part of a transition from a social democratic to neo-\nliberal mode of state engagement with economy and society (Hudson and \nWilliams, 1995). Two aspects of this are particularly relevant here. The first is \n 12 \nthe cutback in central government expenditure on regional policies. However, \nit was second, the privatisation and associated rationalisations of the formerly \nnationalised coal, electricity supply, steel and shipbuilding industries that was \nof greatest significance in revealing the contingent character of the \ndevelopmental trajectory in the north east. The nationalised industries were \nincreasingly unprofitable and as such were adding to public sector borrowing \nin order to ensure their continuing existence. In order to address this problem \nthe state sought to dispose of these industries to private sector interests. \nConsequently, to try and render them more attractive (that is, potentially \nprofitable) to private capital, the formerly close and politically mediated ties \nbetween the nationalised industries were broken as they were allowed to \nsource and sell globally. For example, the electricity supply and steel \nindustries had formed markets for coal, which disappeared as they were \nallowed to buy coal on the international market, with imports from Australia, \nColombia, South Africa. This lead to a series of colliery closures in the north \neast (see Beynon et al, 1991). In addition, and relatedly, these industries were \nsubject to successive rounds of capacity closure and job loss in the north east \n(as well as elsewhere), with the specific intention of making them more \nattractive to potential private sector purchasers. Furthermore, following \nprivatisation there were further rounds of rationalisation, as the new private \nsector owners of these companies sought to make them more profitable \n(Hudson, 1998).  \n \nThe net result was that by the early years of the twenty first century, little \nremained in the north east of the coal, steel and shipbuilding industries: one \n 13 \nsteelworks on Teesside (currently under grave threat as a result of Corus\u201f \ncontinuing crisis and a specialisation in producing semi-finished steel), one \nshipyard on the Tyne and one deep mine (Ellington in Northumberland, the \nsole remnant of the Great Northern Coalfield and due to close in three or four \nyears). There was also a few opencast (strip) mines, which had expanded \nrelatively and absolutely in scale as deep mining contracted, precisely \nbecause their costs of production per tonne of coal were less (Beynon et al, \n2000). However, these too are now declining in extent. In addition, the \nrestructuring of ICI, from a company producing commodity bulk chemicals to \none focussed on speciality chemicals, and the subsequent fragmentation of \nthe formerly integrated chemicals production structure on Teesside, and the \nelimination of swathes of heavy engineering, led to substantial capacity \nreductions. In total these industries employ around 20,000 people; even fifty \nyears ago they employed about well over 400,000 in the north east \u2013 a \nreduction that provides a stark indication of the contingent character of the \nregion\u201fs earlier developmental trajectory.  \n \n \nThe perils of instituted behaviour: institutional and cognitive lock-in \n \nIn recent years there has been a considerable re-emphasis upon the \n\u201einstituted\u201f character of human behaviour. This is partly a result of the re-\ndiscovery of (neo) Polanyian approaches to economic analysis, partly a \ncorollary of a more general concern in parts of economics and sociology with \nthe socially embedded character of action (Granovetter, 1985). There is a \n 14 \nlong tradition of institutional approaches in economics, but the main source of \ninspiration here is the \u201eold\u201f institutional economics of Commons and Veblen \nrather than the new institutional economics of Williamson, which is closely \nlinked to neo-classical approaches (see Hodgson, 1988; 1993; Hudson, \n2001).  \u201eInstituted\u201f behaviour can be thought of as embracing a wide spectrum \nfrom the informality of habits, norms and routines (often unexamined and \nunthinkingly performed, symptomatic of a Gramscian hegemony of some \nideas and ways of thinking over others) to the formality of behaviour within the \nstate and its constituent apparatuses and organisations.  \n \nIn the 1970s and 1980s political-economy approaches to analyses of regional \nuneven development placed great emphasis on the role of extra-regional \nrelationships in shaping regional (under)development trajectories. The  \n\u201cinstitutional turn\u201d in analyses of regional development (Amin, 1998) led to a \nmuch greater emphasis upon intra-regional relationships between firms and \nbetween economic and non-economic processes. As well as the traded inter-\ndependencies of the supply chain, appropriate \u201cinstitutional thickness\u201d (Amin \nand Thrift, 1994) and the untraded inter-dependencies of non-economic social \nand cultural ties (Storper, 1995; 1997) within an associational economy \n(Cooke and Morgan, 1998) were increasingly seen as pivotal to regional \neconomic success in the late twentieth century. However, such untraded inter-\ndependencies had clearly been of crucial importance in the new capitalist \nboom regions of the nineteenth century such as north east England. \nFurthermore, the importance of untraded inter-dependencies in nineteenth \ncentury north east England exemplifies the importance of distinguishing \n 15 \ninnovations in thought from actual developments in the economy that are \nbeing thought about (Hall, 1991). \n  \nThe net result of the intersection and interaction of the linkages of traded and \nuntraded dependencies was to create and reproduce the conditions \nunderpinning a particular growth trajectory for the regional economy. Many \neconomically successful regions, including for a time north east England, can \ntherefore be seen to possess an appropriate institutional thickness, one that \nunderpinned and supported economic activities located within the region, and \nhelped reproduce regionally-specific competencies, tacit knowledge and trust, \nregarded as critical determinants of continuing economic well-being. \nConversely, however, an inappropriate institutional thickness, often a relict \nform from an earlier era when it was supportive of regional economic success, \ncan act as a barrier to moving a regional economy onto a new and more \npromising developmental trajectory (Hudson, 1994), revealing \u201cthe weakness \nof strong ties\u201d (Grabher, 1993). Just as economic growth in north east \nEngland in the nineteenth century had been grounded in a supportive \ninstitutional formation, by the late twentieth century its legacies and relict form \nconstituted a barrier to a transition to a new regional growth trajectory.  \n \nThe effects of the legacies of habits and routines established as constituent \nmoments in the formation of the north east region\u201fs \u201etraditional\u201f economy are \neasily observed. Some of these were relatively permeable and transformable. \nFor example, the strict gender division of labour established as a necessary \npart of the \u201eold\u201f industrial economy broke down. As male employment fell in \n 16 \nthe coal mines, steelworks and shipyards, many of the \u201enew\u201f jobs attracted to \nreplace them were in industries that targeted female wage labour (for \nexample, clothing and consumer electronics, as well as a range of service \nactivities). In part, this had been presaged during the First and Second World \nWars, when shortages of civilian male labour because of conscription led to \nlarge-scale incorporation of women in factory work forces for the duration of \nthe two Wars. Post-war, however, married women returned to their place as \nunpaid domestic workers \u201ein the home\u201f while unmarried women found work in \na range of \u201efemale\u201f industries and occupations, not least the expanding public \nsector services of education and health, performing \u201ecaring\u201f work socially \ndefined as appropriate for women. This is not to say that such transformations \nwere smooth and uncontested; quite the contrary. There were protracted \ndebates about the replacement of \u201emale\u201f with \u201efemale\u201f jobs and many men \nfound genuine difficulty in coming to terms with permanent unemployment and \ntheir role as domestic workers whilst their wives worked outside the home for \na wage. Indeed, many women became both sole wage earner and carried on \nas the main unwaged domestic worker, bringing its own socio-psychological \npressures and tensions.   \n \nIn other respects, however, established informal habits and routines proved \nmuch more resistant to change. For example, the \u201eold\u201f industrial economy had \ninvolved the construction of working class settlements to house workers close \nto their workplaces in the coal mine, factory or works. Archetypically, this \ninvolved the colliery, shipyard or steelworks at the end of the street, and a \nvery short journey to work, typically on foot. Furthermore, sons would follow \n 17 \nfathers into jobs in these workplaces, often based on recruitment practices \nstructured around networks of personal relations of family and friends. As a \nresult, the educational aspirations of many boys were low, as they simply \nexpected to follow in their father\u201fs footsteps in this way. Such training as was \nneeded would, typically for most workers, be provided \u201eon the job\u201f, via \nprocesses of learning-by-doing, learning-by-imitating and learning\u2013by-\nwatching. With the closure of virtually all the workplaces in these industries, \nhowever, such individual trajectories through the labour market are no longer \npossible.  \n \nThe instituted legacies of the past remain, however, in three important ways in \nrelation to people\u201fs commuting behaviour, activity spaces and aspirations and \nexpectations about employment and work. All three represent examples of \ncognitive \u201elock-in\u201f in terms of the ways in which people think of the labour \nmarket and their possibilities in it.  Firstly, there is a marked reluctance to \ncommute, with even modest journeys-to-work of a few kilometres regarded as \nunreasonable. In many ways, the region remains a series of small, discrete \nand spatially bounded labour markets, rather than forming an integrated \nlabour market in which people are linked to employment opportunities across \nthe region. The distance from Newcastle to Middlesbrough, the towns at the \nheart of the region\u201fs northern and southern conurbations, is only 50 \nkilometres, but per capita car ownership rates are low and public transport \nprovision is often poor and expensive, which militates against intra-regional \nlabour mobility. It is, however, important to qualify this by pointing out that \nthere is a continuing imbalance between demand for and supply of labour in \n 18 \nthe region, with many more people seeking waged work than there are \navailable jobs in the region. One response to this has been a growth in long-\ndistance weekly commuting and international labour migration, albeit limited in \nextent  (Beynon et al, 1994).  \n \nSecondly, there is a continuing legacy of recruitment into the \u201etraditional\u201f \nindustries via sons following their fathers in terms of low expectations and \nlimited ambition in terms of education and skills acquisition among many \nyoung people, especially but by no means wholly young men. This cognitive \nlock-in lives on despite the disappearance of the coal mines, shipyards and \nsteelworks.  \n \nThirdly, there is an enduring culture of wage labour, a culture of dependency \non wage labour and employment by others. People by and large expect to be \nemployed in either private or public sector workplaces rather than to become \nself-employed, let alone employ others. This is not to say that there is an \nabsence of entrepreneurial attitudes and ambitions, but it is it to recognise \nthat these are not funnelled into the more conventional channels of SME \nformation and development. Such behaviour, especially when seen to be \nassociated a reliance upon welfare state transfer payments2, is often regarded \nas one reason for the persistent failure of state policies that aim to encourage \nthe formation of indigenous SMEs as the route to a new developmental \ntrajectory in the north east. Many redundant workers have considered \n                                                 \n2\n This raises important and more general questions as to the rights as well as responsibilities \nof citizens, not least their right to lead decent civilized lives in places that remain meaningful \nto them although abandoned by capital and the state as locations of production (see Hudson, \n2001, Chapter 8). \n 19 \nestablishing their own businesses but have taken the economically very \nrational decision not to do so. They are acutely aware that the possibilities of \nsuccessful SME development are very slim in regional and sub-regional \neconomies that are profoundly depressed by the effects of permanent, large-\nscale unemployment and lack of waged work in a thriving formal sector \neconomy. Many regard investing redundancy payments in their home (albeit \none that they will have great difficulty selling should they subsequently decide \nto move in search of work) as a safer and more rational investment of their \nmoney. In some cases, former industrial workers display considerable \nentrepreneurial ability and ingenuity in developing business in the informal \nsector or in or on the fringes of the illegal \u201eblack economy\u201f. \n \nCognitive and institutional lock-in also exists in the more formal realms of \ngovernance, regulation and the state. The origins of regional policy in and for \nnorth east England can be traced back to the 1920s and 1930s. During this \nperiod a cross-class regionalist alliance, dominated by major capitalist \ninterests, successfully lobbied central government and used their political \ninfluence and power to push for the creation of new forms of regional policy. \nThis centred on the attraction of new industries and inward investment to \ndiversify the regional economy and labour market, and helped create new \nopportunities for capital based in the region while seeking to protect existing \ncapitalist interests and the jobs that they provided. This policy was intensified \nfollowing the ending of the Second World War, both via strengthened forms of \nregional policy to attract new branch plant investment and via the \nnationalisation of sectors that were central to the regional economy (coal \n 20 \nmining, iron and steel production, rail transport). This was allied to policy \ninnovations such as the creation of New Towns as an integral part of \nsettlement policies. Public sector infrastructure investment was concentrated \nin key settlements (\u201egrowth points\u201f and \u201ezones\u201f), with the intention that these \nbecame more attractive to private sector investment, seeking to bring together \nnew employment and people in selected locations (Hudson, 1982). With \nvarying emphases, these policies remained in place for some three decades, \nand in certain important respects their legacy in terms of cognitive and policy \nlock-in within the state continues to the present. \n \nThe implementation of these policies required the assignment of new, related \npowers and responsibilities to existing state organisations (for example, the \nplanning responsibilities given to local government). It also required the \nconstruction of new formal institutional arrangements in the region. Many of \nthese took the form of appointed quasi-state organisations (such as the New \nTown Development Corporations and the Regional Economic Planning \nCouncil, established in the 1960s), with little electoral accountability in the \nregion because their members were appointed by central government. These \nbodies tended to be manned (the choice of verb is deliberate) by the same \ncombination of representatives of capital and organised labour as had lobbied \nfor and run the new institutions of the inter-war and war-time periods. As a \nresult, they became locked into a conception of the \u201eregional problem\u201f that \ncentred on notions of industrial obsolescence, old industries and derelict and \npolluted built and natural environments that required \u201emodernisation\u201f as a pre-\n 21 \ncondition to attracting fresh rounds of manufacturing branch plant investment, \nincreasingly from outside the UK (Hudson, 1989).  \n \nAs the limits to this response became increasingly clear in the 1970s, the \npolicy prescription switched from state to private ownership, from large to \nsmall firms, from manufacturing to service sector activities, from inward \ninvestment to indigenous growth. This was no more than a reflection of \ndominant perceptions of the causes of growth in more economically \nsuccessful regions. As such, the transition to a more market-oriented \napproach was embraced and actively promoted with some enthusiasm by \nsome public sector policy makers in the region, often encouraged by \nconsultants that they hired to give advice on developmental strategies for the \nregion (for example, see Northern Regional Strategy Team, 1977). Others \nwere much more sceptical, more wedded to a stronger directive role for the \nstate, so that there were tensions within the public policy community.  These \ntensions were often exacerbated by the effects of the new policy priorities. For \nexample, the influx of call centres was evidence of new service sector growth \nbut in activities that reproduced a \u201ebranch plant\u201f syndrome of unskilled, low \nwage work in establishments controlled by firms located outside the north east \nand vulnerable to competition from lower wage locations in south east Asia \nand Russia.  \n \nIn short, official conceptions of public policy, of the causes of the \u201eregional \nproblem\u201f and of appropriate policy responses to it, remained locked into a \nrestricted conceptual space. This left no alternative to the contradictions of \n 22 \nparticular forms of state engagement with economy and society and the \ndecline of some sorts of private sector activities, other than the \nencouragement of different sorts of private sector activities, as the limits of \nexisting policies became increasingly visible.  The market as resource \nallocation mechanism became increasingly seen, normatively, as the right and \nproper solution to the \u201eregional problem\u201f. If it failed to produce prosperity in the \nnorth east, this reflected failings in and of the region, to be addressed by \npeople in the region, allied to appropriate supply side policies. These varied \nshifts increasingly formed integral components of a more general shift away \nfrom the long post-war social democratic consensus towards a new neo-\nliberal governmentality.  \n \n \nNew modes of regulation, new governmentalities: seeking to break out \nof lock-in   \n \nIn the preceding sections I have argued that we can conceptualise the \ntrajectory of socio-economic change in north east England in terms of path \ncontingency and dependency, encompassing various forms of lock-in and \ninstituted behaviour. I have suggested that the state had a central role in \nthese processes of continuity and change in this quintessentially state- \nmanaged region. The state was centrally involved both in creating and \nreinforcing lock-in to ensure path dependent development between the late \n1920s and mid-1970s and subsequently seeking erode such lock-in to \nfacilitate new developmental trajectories. This has involved seeking to \n 23 \naddress the problems posed to such a transition, especially in terms of the \nattitudes and behaviour of people in the region as part of neo-liberal supply\u2013\nside approaches. In this section, I further explore such issues via concepts of \nregulation, governance and governmentality.  \n \nRegulationist approaches emphasise the social and political grounding of the \neconomy and the non-random coupling between a particular regime of \naccumulation and the social mode of regulation that makes it possible (Boyer, \n1990; MaCleod, 1997).  The latter encompasses both the formal regulatory \nmechanisms of the state apparatus and a range of non-state regulatory \nmechanisms located in the spaces of civil society \u2013 that is, processes of both \ngovernment and governance. While stressing the centrality of the coupling \nbetween accumulation and the political and social conditions that make it \npossible, however, regulationist approaches have little to say about the actual \npractices of government, or about how particular modes of thought and policy \nstyles become (and cease to be) dominant, even hegemonic. Thus \nregulationist approaches tend to assume the existence of forms of lock-in and \nthe persistence of instituted practices but have little to say about their \n(re)production. They have even less to say about how one set of practices is \nreplaced by another and radically different set as a shift from one coupling to \nanother is enacted.  \n \nThere have been attempts to address such issues, however. For example, \nJessop (1990) seeks to build upon regulationist perspectives by drawing \ntogether neo-Gramscian ideas as to how hegemonic practices are channelled \n 24 \nthrough complex ensembles of institutions dispersed throughout civil society \nwith Foucault\u201fs \u201ccapillary\u201d notion of power in theorising the mechanisms of \nstate power and knowledge. This views of power as fluid and relational, \nexercised from innumerable points within civil society, the economy and the \nstate, in productive networks of power that extend beyond the state. \nNonetheless, Foucault privileged the role of the state (the \u201cmacro-physics of \npower\u201d) as \u201cthe point of strategic codification of the multitude of power \nrelations (\u201cthe micro-physics of power\u201d) and the apparatus in which \nhegemony, meta-power, class domination and \u201esur pouvoir\u201f are organised\u201d \n(Jessop, 1990, 239). As such, the state is centrally located in relation to \nprocesses of regulation but the specific ways in which state power is \ndeveloped and deployed vary. Consequently, in theorising the state, it is \nnecessary to allow a significant degree of autonomy to state apparatuses and \nallow for variation in the administrative manner, style and logic by which the \nstate regulates economy and society as it undertakes the practical tasks of \n\u201creal regulation\u201d (Clark, 1992). Practices of implementation can decisively \nshape regional development trajectories. \n \nThe Foucauldian concept of \u201egovernmentality\u201f emphasises the practices of \ngovernment and governance (Dean, 1999) and further illuminates these \nissues. Governmentality \u201cis intrinsically linked to the activities of expertise, \nwhose role is not one of weaving an all-pervasive web of \u201esocial control\u201f, but \nof enacting assorted attempts at the calculated administration of diverse \naspects of conduct through the countless, often competing, local tactics of \neducation, persuasion, inducement, management, incitement, motivation and \n 25 \nencouragement\u201d (MacKinnon, 2000, 296). However, concentrations of expert \nknowledge can unintentionally give rise to \u201cenclosures\u201d, tightly bound sites of \nvigorously defended professional expertise, resistant to the wishes of \ngovernment (Rose and Miller, 1992, 190).  \n \nMoreover, such the practices of governmentality are territorially demarcated. \nSpace is an important element of governmentality because \u201cto govern it is \nnecessary to render visible the space over which government is to be \nexercised. And this is not simply a matter of looking: space has to be re-\npresented, marked out\u201d (Thrift, 2002, 205). This thereby locates the space of \nthe state as one element in wider circuits of power and moves from a position \nthat sees the state as simply an explanation of other events to one that \nregards the specific activities of the state as themselves something to be \nexplained. The black box of the state must be opened up in order to explain \nhow it can perform with a degree of functional coherence.  As Jessop (1990, \n229) puts it, such internal coherence can only be achieved through the \nsuccessful realisation of specific \u201cstate projects\u201d which unites state agencies \nand officials behind a distinct line of action.  Achieving such unity is thereby a \ncontingent matter. Even if it is achieved, however, there is no guarantee that \nsuch projects will always and only have their intended effects, as the \ndevelopmental history of the north east makes abundantly clear. \n \nThese concepts of regulation, governance and governmentality allow \nexploration of three sets of issues pertaining to that developmental history. \nThe first concerns the relations between the \u201eregional problem\u201f and notions of \n 26 \ngovernmentality, linked to the transition (initially in the 1920s) from an analytic \nrecognition of regional uneven development to the political identification of \n\u201eproblem regions\u201f. A key issue here is the ways in which \u201eproblem regions\u201f are \nmade visible, constituted as objects of state policy via the construction of \nregional statistics, regional plans (with their focus on outputs) and regional \nstrategies (with their focus on process and outcomes). Furthermore, there are \nimportant connections between the ways in which the \u201eregional problem\u201f is \ndefined and the perception of appropriate forms of regional policies to tackle \nit. This may involve seeking to help reinforce or to change forms of instituted \nbehaviour and secure or alter the existing developmental trajectory.  \n \nThe evolution in emphasis from plans (for example, Teesside County Borough \nCouncil, 1972) via strategic plans (Northern Regional Strategy Team, 1977) to \nstrategies (ONE North East, 2000) is linked to a political shift from \npredominantly social-democratic politics to a neo-liberal politics. The UK state \nwas at the forefront of making this transition, given particular impetus by the \nThatcher governments\u201f of the 1980s and continued in the subsequent era of \n\u201cNew Labour\u201d. This has entailed a shift from a belief in the possibility, \nlegitimacy and validity of socially\u2013progressive re-distributive planning via \ncentral state action to one that embraces the market as the main economic \nsteering mechanism. This had definite implications for people in the north east \nas the state sought to cut back the extent of its direct engagement with \neconomy and society there and, not entirely successfully, to encourage \ngreater mobility in the labour market and encourage entrepreneurial \nbehaviour. This switch also lends a certain political specificity to the \n 27 \nexperiences of the UK, as neo-liberalism penetrated widely into policy \ndomains - competition, industrial and technology, employment and social - \nwith spatially differentiating results, as well as into those of urban and regional \npolicy. As such, the shift to neo-liberalism radically re-drew the boundaries \nbetween state, economy and civil society, at least in part because of fears of \na fiscal crisis of the state, to create a UK-specific variant among the \u201cmany \nnational capitalisms\u201d (Schmidt, 2002) of neo-liberal late modernity.  \n \nPart of this re-drawing of the boundaries has involved re-defining the \ngeometry of state power, with a decentralisation of responsibility for regional \ndevelopment issues to the regional level within the state. Thus the region \nbecame socially constituted as an active subject in seeking to resolve the \nregional problem, the second issue that I want to consider here. Rather than \nregional policies designed and administered by the central state, there is now \na more complex multi-level system of governance that conjoins EU, national, \nregional and sub-regional in a more complex geometry. However, these new \narrangements devolve greater responsibilities to regional and sub-regional \nlevels for dealing with issues of regional economic development and \nregeneration. This has been emphasised within the region by the creation of \nthe ONE North East Regional Development Agency, the four sub-regional \npartnerships to which it devolves most of its budget, and the Local Strategic \nPartnerships now being established across the region under the leadership of \nLocal Authorities (Liddle and Townsend, 2002).  \n \n 28 \nIt is important to emphasise that these are not simply changes imposed \nexternally upon the region. There were social forces within the region arguing \nin favour of such changes, with local politicians wanting greater \ndecentralisation of power and resources to their authorities and an emergent \nsmall but vociferous lobby seeking a regional assembly and much greater \nregional autonomy. In principle, these three levels are intended to produce a \nseamless web of \u201ejoined up\u201f socio-economic development and regeneration \npolicies in the region, with a heavy emphasis upon \u201ccluster\u201d polices in \neconomic development. Practice deviates somewhat from this principle, \nhowever \u2013 and there is scant recognition that successful \u201ccluster\u201d policies \ncould engender precisely the forms of lock-in that were previously seen as a \ndiagnostic feature of the regional problem. \n \nThe emergent emphasis on regional and sub-regional strategies reflects a \nperception within neo-liberal policy circles and the UK state as to the need to \nbalance two competing tensions. Firstly, pressures arising from a perception \nas to the technical impossibility and normative undesirability of planning within \nthe social relations of capitalism, and the uncertainties and unpredictabilities \nthat these unavoidably create. Secondly, socio-political pressures for the state \nto be seen to be concerned with issues of democratic accountability and \nsocio-spatial inequality. Responsibility for regional issues in north east \nEngland, however, has often been devolved to central government appointed \nQUANGOS (such as Urban Development #corporations). This has generated \nnew forms of \u201edemocratic deficit\u201f as these organisations are politically \nunaccountable within the region, with evident dangers in undermining the \n 29 \ncredibility of the case for devolving power as part of a new governmentality \nthrough which to address regional development problems (Beynon et al, \n1994).  \n \nIn addition, decentralisation to the regional level has often involved greater \nreliance on institutions within civil society acting together (\u201ein partnership\u201f) with \nregional, sub-regional and\/or local state organisations. The notion of \n\u201fpartnership\u201f and collaborative working at and between these levels is \nimportant, although not all partners have equal power and influence in the \npartnership. In particular, many partnerships remain dominated or led by parts \nof the state. Even so, partnership signals a blurring of the boundaries \nbetween market, state and civil society as processes of governance partially \nreplace those of government. Allied to this, there has been a discernible \ntendency towards \u201ethe community\u201f as both subject and object of intra-regional \npolicies to tackle uneven development. This in turn has often been linked to \nan emphasis upon the \u201ethird sector\u201f or social economy as the route to tackling \n\u201eregional problems\u201f and problems of intra-regional regeneration (Amin et al, \n2002).  \n \nThe turn to the third sector signals recognition that state policy attempts to \nbreak unwanted forms of lock-in, for example by encouraging greater labour \nmobility and entrepreneurial activity via establishing SMEs, have largely been \nineffectual. People wish to remain in their places but not to become \nentrepreneurs in the formal mainstream economy. The growing focus upon \nthe social economy is recognition both of this and the fact that increasingly \n 30 \nlarge swathes of the territory of regions such as north east England now fall \noutside the decisive circuits of capital. They have been eviscerated by capital \nflight and effectively abandoned by the state beyond a residual commitment to \nmaintain a minimum level of welfare provision there. However, it is precisely \nthe impoverished condition of such places that militates against the \ndevelopment of a vibrant \u201ealternative\u201f social economy there, amplified by a \nmore general state suspicion of potentially \u201csubversive\u201d social economies \nsuch as LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems). Thus the turn to the social \neconomy represents an attempt to reconcile tensions between immanent \naccumulation and rationality crises on the one hand and legitimation crises on \nthe other as both capital and the national state lose interest in the region as a \nspace for the production of surplus value. In its turn, however, it creates \npolitical tensions at local and regional levels as the developmental limits of the \nsocial economy become clear. For example, over much of north east \nEngland, the social economy is most notable by its absence, particularly in \nthose areas in which it is needed most (Amin et al, 2002), and where it does \ndevelop tends to reproduce the socio-economic inequalities of the \nmainstream within it (Bowring, 199x). . \n \nThe third issue that I want to consider also flows directly from this growing \nmarginalisation of the region in the concerns of capital and the national state. \nThis is the emergence of Task Forces as a characteristic policy response of \nthe new neo-liberal governmentality and, more particularly, of the particular \npolitics of \u201eNew Labour\u201f to tackle place and\/or industry specific problems of \neconomic decline. There are marked similarities between such Task Forces \n 31 \nand the \u201cproject teams\u201d that have come to characterise much of the \ncontemporary economy (Grabher, 2002). Such Task Forces have exploded in \nnumber and have become endemic in north east England \u2013 though not only \nthere. They have been established as ad hoc bodies intended to deal flexibly \nand rapidly with specific policy problems, typically associated with the \n(un)expected decline of a particular industry or sector (including coal mining, \nclothing, electronics, steel, textiles) and its consequences on the places in \nwhich it was formerly concentrated (Pike, 2002). Others seek to arrest or \nreverse decline \u2013 for example the Teesside Chemical Initiative (Chapman, \n2003) for reasons that are explicable in terms of sub-regional politics and the \ndifficulties of imagining Teesside without chemical production, rather than a \nmore realistic assessment of the global political-economy of chemicals \nproduction. The membership of these bodies consists of a mix of private and \npublic sector representatives, typically drawn from a cast of \u201cusual suspects\u201d. \nSelf-defined key players in the region find new niches in these partnerships \nfrom which to exercise power and preserve their own influence (Robinson and \nShaw, 2000), often drawn together around notions of partnership and \nperception of a shared regional interest (as they first were in the 1930s). They \ncan be characterised as non-statutory (that is, non-QUANGO) and multi-\nagency organisations, with selected and defined membership, with initially an \nindeterminate but always temporary lifespan. Typically, however, like the \nearlier QUANGOS they are opaque, unaccountable, closed off to wider \npolitical and public scrutiny, with the hand of central government often \nprominent and with limited links to and co-ordination with the actions of other \npublic policy bodies.  Fundamentally, they are designed to mop up and paper \n 32 \nover the consequences of economic decline, a combination of sticking plaster \nand sponge. They symbolise the transition from a concern with planning to \none with strategy, understood as developing ad hoc ways of coping with the \nconsequences of unplanned, unexpected and emergent changes in economic \ncircumstances in a region marked by long-term structural economic decline.  \n \n \n \nConcluding comments \n \nIn this paper, I have argued that concepts of path contingent and dependent \ndevelopment, instituted behaviour, especially in terms of cognitive and policy \nlock-in, and governmentality allow a deepened, more nuanced understanding \nof the changing position of regions such as north east England in\/out of \nprocesses and circuits of capital accumulation. They thus facilitate a better \nunderstanding of processes of regional uneven development. Allied to \nstructural political-economy understandings, they help reveal more subtle \nperspectives upon the practices of key social actors that recognise the power \nof structural constraints while revealing more about the determination of \nregional developmental trajectories within them. \n \nFinally, by way of conclusion, I want to make some brief comments about the \nbroader implications of the approach to understanding regional change that I \nhave explored. While the empirical focus in this paper has been on a single \nregion, the north east of England, this region exists, as it has done for \n 33 \ncenturies, as part of a global political-economy. Other regions have \nexperienced similar trajectories of growth, decline and occasionally renewal. \nThe approach explored here could, therefore, be used as the basis both for \nanalysis of other regions - both other declining \u201cold industrial regions\u201d and \ncontemporary \u201chot spots\u201d of growth - and for inter-regional comparative \nanalysis. Focusing upon the determinants of trajectories of change and the \nspecific institutional forms of different regions could help unravel the reasons \nas to why regions change in varying ways \u2013 some as \u201cwinners\u201d, some as \n\u201closers\u201d - within the structural limits of a capitalist political economy. As such, \nit could help throw light on the key questions as to how and why regions \nexperience different forms and trajectories of change, as to how the fortunes \nof different regions relate to one another and of how regional change both \nreflects and helps reproduce those systemic limits. The growing inter-\nconnections between regions within a neo-liberal globalising economy in the \ntwenty first century further reinforce the case for deepening understanding of \nthe co-evolution of regional development trajectories.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis is a revised version of a paper prepared for the International Workshop \non \u201eThe restructuring of old industrial areas in Europe and Asia\u201f, University of \nBonn, 11-12 July 2003.
