A5 paperback, xiil79 pages. \u00a318.99. This book was first published in 1996 but has since been reprinted. It is an interesting publication in that it provides many useful perspectives on the currently popular topic of 'lifelong learning'. Those who are new to this area would find the nine chapters and three appendices in this book a useful introduction to the subject. However, because it is now almost three years old, this volume does not cover the latest trends and developments that are now taking place in this exciting area. The book is not a technical one; it deals, instead, with the important ideas, concepts and educational philosophies relating to learning as an ongoing, lifetime process and activity in which anyone and everyone can participate. Following two Forewords and an Introduction, the first chapter of the book serves to introduce the concept of lifelong learning. It defines and discusses the meaning of the term and outlines the basic nature of this approach to selfimprovement. A strong case is made for adopting the central ideas underlying lifelong learning in all aspects of life, work and family. In the following chapter the authors introduce eight paradigm changes that they feel will be necessary in order to facilitate this mechanism of pedagogy in the forthcoming 'lifelong learning age of the 21st century'. Chapter 2 also identifies four important trends for enabling lifelong learning and then goes on to discuss a learner's charter -based on the ELLI principles of learning; ELLI is an acronym for the European Lifelong Learning Initiative. The following three chapters describe and debateAdi-J VWume 7 Number I different approaches to the realization and promotion of lifelong learning. Chapter 3 (entitled 'Where Lifelong Learning Begins') discusses the roles that schools can play in 'seeding' and nurturing the development of sound lifelong learning principles and techniques while chapter 4 ('Learning for Earning: Learning for Survival') is concerned with work-place activities relating to the realization of personal empowerment using this mechanism of&quot; study. Chapter 5 deals with 'Learning Organisations' and how interest in these has grown during the last decade or so. The rationale underlying this approach to lifelong learning has been motivated by the potential it offers for improving an organization's performance through 'the development of the human potential in the workforce'. As well as listing and discussing the ten chief characteristics of a learning organization, this chapter also includes a case study based on the Rover Group in the UK. Two important recommendations put forward by this case study are: 'personal empowerment in industry demands certain responses from schools, universities and colleges... some serious thinking needs to be done on the sorts of lifetime skills, curriculum content and learning methodologies that these organisations encourage' (p. 83); and 'Schools, universities and colleges must also become learning organizations, learning from the experience of industry, the requirements of employability and the demands of the wider society' (p. 84). Bearing in mind what was said above, the two subsequent chapters then discuss how various groups might respond to the need to promote lifelong learning on a wider and more effective basis. Chapter 6 is therefore concerned with the role of teachers and teacher-training organizations as 'change agents' in the context of promoting human development. It discusses issues of teacher education and how this can contribute to the urgent need for promoting lifelong learning skills both in schools and in the community. Chapter 7 then considers some of the challenges and opportunities ' offered by various approaches to the realization of lifelong learning in higher education. Particular emphasis is given to the roles that universities should play. These roles are embedded within (and illustrated by means of) a conceptual model that reflects the central co-ordinating function that universities could perform in facilitating the creation of various types of learning community. In this chapter the authors provide a list of important areas where useful future research is needed and might be conducted; they also emphasize the importance of university\/industry partnerships. In chapter 8 ('Lifelong Learning and the Quality of Life') the authors start off by discussing various mechanisms for the creation of learning communities and how these could in turn form the basis of a 'Learning Society'. They then bring together many of the threads of previous chapters into a set of actions to stimulate the wider vision of a learning society. Chapter 9 (the 'Valediction') is a relatively short one. It discusses some of the more important learning challenges that we will need to face in the forthcoming learning age. Throughout the book, frequent reference is made to ELLI's Action Agenda for Lifelong Learning. This arose as an outcome from the First Global Conference on Lifelong Learning; it is documented in some detail in Appendix 1. The second appendix gives details of WILL (the World Initiative on Lifelong Learning) while Appendix 3 describes 'Odyssey of the Mind' - an international schools' tournament that is designed to promote the skills of lifelong learning in school children.","cites":null},{"id":192646,"title":"Minimalism beyond the Nurnberg Funnel,","authors":[],"date":"1998","doi":"10.1145\/311147.311156","raw":"Carroll, J.

ISBN: 0-7494-2566-0. Hardback, xiiil59 pages. \u00a319.99. In today's world of student-centred education and experiential learning, teachers are on a constant lookout for methods and techniques that will provide interesting and exciting learning opportunities for their students. Simulations and games are ideally suited to the task. They can be used in a very wide spectrum of learning situations and they engender high levels of commitment, involvement and more than a little competitiveness from students, attributes sadly lacking in more traditional teaching approaches. What might a teacher ask of a book claiming to introduce them to classroom simulations and games? Several key questions come to mind: \u2022 What is the difference between a simulation and a game? \u2022 How can I justify the resources needed to develop or learn a new simulation? \u2022 How effective are they as a tool for teaching and learning? \u2022 What subjects can they be used for? \u2022 How are they used in a classroom? \u2022 How easy is it to find or develop them for a specific course? How well does this book address these questions? In a word, admirably. The authors' 'opening gambit' is the development of a typology of simulations and games. A glance at this opening chapter quickly dispels any fears about what is meant by the term 'simulation' as the relationships between simulations, games and case studies are explored and placed in a sound conceptual framework. If the mere mention of 'simulation' conjures up images of computer-based models, complex manuals and steep learning curves then this book is for you. While occasionally making reference to more sophisticated alternatives, this text is clearly focused on less resource-hungry, simpler, 'paper-based' simulations and games. Chapters 2 and 3 address the educational value of simulations and justify their use. They cover such issues as strengths and weaknesses, effectiveness, type and format selection, and the preparation and running of educational simulations or games. If you need to justify the use of a simulation (whether on educational or resource grounds) then the information in these chapters will help. The strong opening is developed in the 'middle game'. Making heavy use of examples and case studies (one of the book's main strengths) the authors explore the use of simulations and games in each of four age brackets: nursery, lower primary, upper primary\/lower secondary and upper secondary. Each has its own chapter (Chapters 4-7), each with a tripartite structure. Each opens with a brief discussion of the educational needs of the age group, then covers how appropriate simulations and games may be integrated into the curricula, and ends with a number of case studies (often with enough detail to be able to run the simulation for oneself). Collectively, these chapters offer both depth and breadth of insight into how simulations and games can work with almost any learning material, from simple association and sequencing at nursery level, through personal health care at primary level, to accounting and economic principles at upper secondary level, and beyond. In the process they illustrate the practical aspects of running simulations in the classroom. The 'end game' (Chapters 8-10) is equally strong, offering guidance on adapting or developing simulations. Two approaches are explored. Chapter 8 looks at the 'top-down' or algorithmic approach in which the learning objectives and basic design criteria are specified first, followed by decisions on content and format (e.g. card game, board game, computer based game, role play, etc.), and ending with the development of a total package (manuals, instructions, playing materials, etc.). Chapter 9 outlines the alternative, 'bottom-up', more inspirational approach to development. Here the developer uses an existing 'technology' as inspiration (e.g. Monopoly, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuits, etc.) and builds an educational experience on familiar foundations. The authors' use of simple examples (e.g. a 'health' game based on the 'Snakes and Ladders' principle) make the ideas very accessible and only a little lateral thinking is needed to understand how such ideas might be applied at any educational level. Chapter 10 addresses today's educational 'holy grail' - a truly student-centred approach to learning. This final chapter explains how to involve students in the simulation design and development process whereby the learning experience is not limited to participation in the 71Reviews game but is extended to understanding and modelling of the process needed to develop the game. The book ends (as a good practical text should) by offering guidance to those wishing to further their interest in simulations through a very useful (although not comprehensive) list of additional readings and a list of contact addresses for publishers of the 32 simulations referred to in the text. Like most introductory texts it has its limitations although in this case they are relatively minor. Firstly, it is clearly targeted at the primary and secondary teacher. However, Chapters 8 to 10 clearly demonstrate how simple formats can be extended to any educational level. Secondly, most examples are drawn from the authors' own experience of integrating simulations into the Scottish educational system. However, this offers a very complete illustration of how easily local industries can be used as a basis for (say) a business studies simulation. A little lateral thinking is all that is needed for the simulations to be adapted for use in any area, educational system, or at any level (and some will transfer directly). In the final analysis, the primary and secondary education focus does not limit the usefulness of this book to teachers in just those sectors. If this book has one real oversight, it is in its limited coverage of the more sophisticated, computer-based simulations, more often used in higher education and training, although even this limitation is partially addressed through the listings in the bibliography. In addition, given the cost and resource requirements of these simulations, the vast range of available simulations, and the book's focus on the primary and secondary education sectors, this oversight can be forgiven. Overall, this a very practical, well-written, accessible and readable book, which offers a fascinating introduction to the use of simulations in education, and has four very strong attributes that recommend it to teachers at all levels: 1. It offers a sound framework for classifying simulations, games and case studies. 2. It provides justification for and guidance on using-simulations and games for educational purposes. 3. It is full of examples and practical illustrations of simulations and games in use in the classroom. 72 4. It offers highly practical and easily implemented suggestions on how a teacher might develop course-specific simulations and games. For anyone new to, or interested in, alternative learning technologies or simulations and gaming in education, this book will make a useful addition to their library. It certainly makes a useful contribution to the literature in both fields.","cites":null},{"id":192651,"title":"Using People Skills in Training","authors":[],"date":"1998","doi":null,"raw":"Philip Barker, University of Teesside Leslie Rae, Using People Skills in Training and Development, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-7494-2575-X. Paperback, vii243 pages. \u00a319.99. Anyone associated with technology in education is acutely aware of what is coming to be called the 'crisis in support'. Machines do not repair themselves (yet), nor does software install itself, or a network administer itself. Worse, users do 73Reviews not learn how to use complex hardware and software by osmosis. Rather end-users need to be assisted and trained, and a growing number of computer assistants need, themselves, to be trained. This is where Using People Skills can help. The book applies psychological models of interpersonal relations to the training process. To give a notion of the book's scope, some of the models covered include Kolb's Learning Cycle, Maslow's Hierarchy, the Hertzberg Approach, the Johari Window, Behaviour Analysis, T-Groups, Transactional Analysis, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and the Beblin Model. The book is written in a general format, and could apply to any organization in which managers must train subordinates. I approached the book as the manager of a higher education computing laboratory, with the need to train a team of students to act as peer consultants who help other students and staff use the lab. Teaching my consultants the details of hardware and software is not sufficient. If I can also help improve my consultants' 'people skills' they will be more effective in their jobs helping others. The first half of this book is titled 'Communication Aspects of People Skills', and consists of five chapters, entitled 'Communication', 'People Differences', 'Communication and Behaviour', 'Observing Behaviour', and 'Other Methods of Observing People'. The principal focus is on communication and recognizing the best way to reach an audience. The idea that different people learn in different ways is stressed, and Rae cites a number of ideas from educational psychology. He warns that the attention span of trainees is typically no more than 20 minutes, and in 'chalk-and-talk' training, attention may wane in ten minutes or less. In writing the book, Rae follows his own advice. He keeps his sections short and to the point, and frequently breaks up the text with the equivalent of overhead slides - indeed he suggests that his boxed lists and summaries might be useful visuals if the reader wishes to present this material in a training session for trainers. The second half of the book is collectively tided 'Specific Aspects of People Skills', and has eight chapters: two on 'Coaching Skills', one each on 'Delegating and Mentoring', 'Role Plays', 'Some Group Approaches to People Skills', 'Team Building and Development', and two chapters on 'Dealing with Difficult People'. The book concludes with a list of over 100 references on 74 training and people skills, usefully grouped into twelve categories. As an example of the theoretical nature of the book, in chapter 5 ('Observing Behaviour'), Rae discusses 'Behaviour Analysis' (BA). After going through a brief history of BA, he describes the practice, which consists of an observer scoring a number of trainees simultaneously in up to sixteen categories of behaviour. Clearly such analysis requires considerable skill and experience and is not appropriate for readers who, rather than being behaviour analysts, have had training responsibilities thrust upon them. I was a bit disappointed here and elsewhere that the chapter is not more practical. I would prefer to see more explanation for why this technique, or others Rae discusses elsewhere in the book, should be used. After observing and recording, which behaviours are preferred, and which are to be discouraged? How can the trainer affect changes in trainee behaviour? Rae stops short of giving this sort of practical advice. For all of the theory in the book, I found some useful pointers to help in organizing training sessions. The elaboration of different methods by which people learn, covered in chapter 3, is important to keep in mind in designing training sessions. Effective training should allow trainees to absorb material in a way that most suits them. The chapter on 'Team Building' was also quite helpful. In the area of learning technology, it is likely that individuals will have specialized skills. In order to provide help to end-users, a team of consultants will need to work well together, and building an effective team should be a high priority for the trainer. Another useful pointer I gleaned from the book comes in the introductory chapter. Rae advocates that trainees be encouraged\/required to maintain a 'learning log' throughout the training process. A learning log is essentially a structured note-taking process consisting of three parts. The first part is the raw notes taken by a trainee during training. The second part is a more thoughtful rendering of the notes, in which the important points are summarized and perhaps elaborated. Finally, the third part of the log is a set of implementation decisions, detailing how the trainee is going to put the newly acquired knowledge to work. Along with the log, Rae advocates setting aside time, at least daily during training, when trainees compare their notes to discover possible gaps in their understanding, and to see how others haveAu-J Vfo\/ume 7 Number I prioritized the preceding lessons. In the field of technical consulting, these logs compiled by trainees, along with handouts would become a basic reference manual in which concepts are explained in the trainee's own words. In all, I found the book to be rather more theoretical than I had expected, or that I need in my role as a trainer, with relatively few specific practices to recommend. In particular, I found it a bit surprising to find almost no mention of the use of computer technology in the training process (but then, the book is about people skills). The book is pitched as a general overview of a wide variety of training theories, which should be quite useful to the full-time professional trainer. To such a person, the book would serve as an introduction or review of many psychological models of teaching and learning. Some background in educational psychology would probably be helpful to gain maximum advantage from the book. J.

Hardback,\nx310 pages, \u00a335.00.\nThere is something curious about a book title\nthat associates the terms 'university' with\n'learning' - at least in the way Bowden and\nMarton have chosen. While most would agree\nthat universities serve society through 'teaching,\nresearch and community service', it is the simple\ndescription of a new breed of institution that is\nabout learning - not teaching or research or\ncommunity service, that is disconcerting. The\nauthors have a principled reason for so doing.\nAfter all - what is the outcome of teaching - but\nlearning? What is the outcome of research if not\nbetter informed debate and 'learned' scientists?\nWhat is the outcome of community service if\nnot people better able to make sense of the world\nin which they live? But a University of Learning\n. . . that is a different matter - or so it has been\nup to now. Universities must address the needs\nof learners. Learning as we now tend to see it - is\nabout '. . . the process whereby knowledge is\ncreated through the transformation of\nexperience' (Kolb, 1984). The needs of learners\nrequire teachers to construct challenging\nopportunities. Opportunities for learners to\npuzzle and reflect. Through experimentation and\nconceptualization, learners transform events,\nideas, experiences into testable hypotheses -\nsetting their reflections against personal frame-\nworks.\n68\nThis book is about learning. It is also about the\nway we need to rethink university teaching (c.f.\nLaurillard, 1993). Teaching and the design of\nteaching needs to be freed from simplistic\ntransmission models. Such models still pervade\nhigher education and often underpin so-called\n'innovative teaching'. Students do not have hard-\nwired Nurnberg Funnels attached to their heads\n(cf. Carroll, 1998)! Learning technologists need\nto address three fundamental questions when\nthey are involved in innovative teaching\ndevelopments. First, in what way does the design\nof courses, modules and classes draw on what is\nknown about the process of learning and the\nexperience of learning? Second, can innovative\nteaching methods that use communications and\ninformation technology make the most of the\nopportunities for learners to transform experi-\nence into personal understandings? Third, in\nwhat way will those who seek accredited\nmembership of the ILT (Institute of Learning\nand Teaching) begin to transform higher educa-\ntion into an experience that serves students'\nneeds and interests?\nJohn Bowden and Ference Marton have drawn\ntogether a rich and rewarding set of ideas that\nnot only make us ask questions about our rush\ninto competency-based education (see below)\nbut redefines 'quality' to mean quality of\nexperience for the learner. A quality of\nexperience that is facilitated by learning\ntechnologists and teachers who grasp two simple\nyet powerful observations. First, learning is the\nresult of designed experiences. Second, learning\nAa-J Volume 7 Number I\nis the result of active enquiry by active minds\nthat reflect on and make sense of such planned\nand designed experiences. Universities will more\nand more be assessed in terms of the learning\nthey bring about. This output is not the simple\ntransmission or communication of knowledge.\nThe output is as yet unknown! Just as able and\nscholarly researchers make sense of their\ndomain through scientific enquiry, so too,\nlearners approach learning with many questions\nand incomplete conceptual frameworks.\nThis book is not easy reading. It is not easy\nbecause it redefines some familiar ideas of\n'teaching, learning and scholarly enquiry'. It is\nnot easy because the narrative is a logical\nreflective analysis of what the authors see\naround them - transformed by research findings\nand empirical investigation. Just as Diana\nLaurillard's book Re-Thinking University\nTeaching (1993) transformed the vocabulary of\nteaching - this book will transform the way we\nsee learning.\nThe book comprises eleven chapters and 310\npages. In this brief note I can only select two\nsections for comment. First, there is a very\ncomplex argument about Collective\nConsciousness and the Ethics of Learning\n(Chapter 8). The authors assert' . . . we grasp\nthe world more fully by taking part in each\nother's differing ways of seeing i t . . . not only are\nstudents supposed to learn from their teachers\nbut also teachers from their students; as in\nresearch, we are supposed to learn from each\nother . . .' (p. 208) [reviewer's emphasis]. This\nbrief challenge to our collective consciousness as\nlearning technologists should be written above\nthe doors of Learning Support Units and the\nnew ILT. Imagine learning from our students or\nwith our students! What more challenge is there\nfor us as learning technologists than to make the\nmost of communication and information\ntechnology, curriculum design and good sound\ncommon sense to create Universities of\nLearning. Now there is an outcome that the ILT\nplanning group did not anticipate!\nSecond, the authors make a point to deconstruct\n'competence'. About time - the Enterprise in\nHigher Education movement was never fully\nthought-out and its descendant - 'Transferable-\nSkills Push' - is still a conceptual minefield.\nBowden and Marton distinguish between\ncompetence as units of behaviour in the work\nplace (cf. transferable skills) and 'competence' as\n'capabilities for seeing and handling novel\nsituations in powerful ways . . . \" (p. 114). The\nquestion of what is to be learned in higher\neducation is not a closed question. If we are to\nhave Universities of Learning, then we must\nbegin to articulate through curriculum design,\nideas that grow with reflection and conceptual\nchallenge. Designers will have to become\ninvolved in what is learned - as well as how and\nwhen and where, questions that so influence\ninnovation programmes.\nRead this book - with an open mind; it is\nworthwhile changing one's views on teaching\nand learning in higher education - better still it is\nrewarding to bring about the circumstances to\ncreate a University of Learning.\nReferences\nCarroll, J.

In the transcript of this talk he\nidentifies three important educational and\ntraining crises: access, cost and flexibility. He\ngoes on to extol the virtues of both his 'mega-\nuniversity' paradigm and the techniques that are\ncurrently being used by the UK's Open\nUniversity (OU) for helping to resolve these\ncrises. Subsequent chapters in this section then\naddress the relevance and potential of the Web\nfor the support of learners with physical dis-\nabilities and its use for providing appropri-\nate infrastructures for facilitating large-scale\ndistance-learning activities. Media integration\nthrough the use of meta-learning environments\n(involving interactive course-maps and study\nguides) and the use of virtual science\nlaboratories are also discussed.\nEach of the chapters in the second part of the\nbook deals with using Web-based technology to\nsupport collaborative activity and\/or tele-\npresence. The first of the five contributions in\nthis section discusses various techniques for\npromoting learner dialogues on the Web. Most\nof this chapter deals with a conferencing system\ncalled 'EBBS' (Extended Bulletin Board\nSystem), although some mention of another\npopular system (FirstClass) is also made. The\nconcept of dialogue is further continued in the\nfollowing chapter - but from a slightly different\nperspective. This chapter describes and discusses\na Web-based publishing toolkit called 'D3E'\n(Digital Document Discourse Environment)\nwhich is being used to support scholarly\npublishing and debate within an electronic,\nnetwork-based medium. D3E can automate\nmany of the editorial tasks involved in electronic\njournal publication. For example, it can facilitate\nthe dialogues that can take place between\neditors, reviewers, authors and readers. A\n70\nnumber of examples of its use are presented -\nincluding the OU's Journal of Interactive Media\nin Education (JIME). Subsequent chapters in\nthis second section of the book deal with the\n'KMi Stadium' webcasting facility (for the\nsupport of telepresence on the Web), 'KMi\nPlanet' (an automated, Web-based news server)\nand the OU's 'Internet Software Visualization\nLaboratory' (which is used to support the\nteaching of Prolog programming).\nThe five contributions that make up the final\npart of the book all deal with Web applications\nrelated to knowledge handling - primarily from\nan artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. The\nsection commences with a discussion of the use\nof the LispWeb server for supporting access to\nAI applications over the Web. This is followed by\na contribution that discusses knowledge\nmodelling using approaches that are based on\nthe use of ontologies. The ontologjcal approach\nalso forms the basis of the next chapter that\ndeals with The World Wide Design Lab'; this is\nan environment that has been created in order to\nsupport distributed collaborative design activity.\nThe design methodology that is embedded\nwithin this system is illustrated by means of a\ncase study involving the co-operative design of a\nnew motor vehicle. The final two chapters in this\nsection deal with the use of software 'agents' to\nsupport various online activities. Three example\nsystems are described: a scheduling agent for\nmeetings (called 'Luigi'); a \"virtual librarian' for\nuse in a digital library facility; and an automated\nassistant for helping OU tutors handle electronic\nconferencing with large groups of students. The\nlatter system forms a 'Virtual Participant' that\nhas access to an electronic archive of past\ndiscussion threads and uses these to drive a case-\nbased support strategy.\nOverall, I found the sixteen chapters in this book\nboth interesting and stimulating. Indeed, the\nbook contains a wide range of useful topics and\ntechniques relating to the many growing\napplications of Web-based technology and\nartificial intelligence for the support of teaching\nand learning within the context of distance\neducation. Although many of the techniques are\ndescribed and discussed in terms of the Open\nUniversity's own particular interests, it is easy to\nsee how much of what is described in this book\ncould be applied to other situations involving\nteaching and learning practices within conven-\ntional college and university environments.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nALT-J Volume 7 Number I\nHenry Ellington, Monica Gordon and Joannie\nFowlie, Using Games and Simulations in the\nClassroom, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN: 0-\n7494-2566-0. Hardback, xiiil59 pages. \u00a319.99.\nIn today's world of student-centred education\nand experiential learning, teachers are on a\nconstant lookout for methods and techniques\nthat will provide interesting and exciting learning\nopportunities for their students. Simulations and\ngames are ideally suited to the task. They can be\nused in a very wide spectrum of learning situa-\ntions and they engender high levels of commit-\nment, involvement and more than a little\ncompetitiveness from students, attributes sadly\nlacking in more traditional teaching approaches.\nWhat might a teacher ask of a book claiming to\nintroduce them to classroom simulations and\ngames? Several key questions come to mind:\n\u2022 What is the difference between a simulation\nand a game?\n\u2022 How can I justify the resources needed to\ndevelop or learn a new simulation?\n\u2022 How effective are they as a tool for teaching\nand learning?\n\u2022 What subjects can they be used for?\n\u2022 How are they used in a classroom?\n\u2022 How easy is it to find or develop them for a\nspecific course?\nHow well does this book address these\nquestions? In a word, admirably.\nThe authors' 'opening gambit' is the develop-\nment of a typology of simulations and games. A\nglance at this opening chapter quickly dispels\nany fears about what is meant by the term\n'simulation' as the relationships between simula-\ntions, games and case studies are explored and\nplaced in a sound conceptual framework. If the\nmere mention of 'simulation' conjures up images\nof computer-based models, complex manuals\nand steep learning curves then this book is for\nyou. While occasionally making reference to\nmore sophisticated alternatives, this text is\nclearly focused on less resource-hungry, simpler,\n'paper-based' simulations and games.\nChapters 2 and 3 address the educational value\nof simulations and justify their use. They cover\nsuch issues as strengths and weaknesses, effect-\niveness, type and format selection, and the\npreparation and running of educational simula-\ntions or games. If you need to justify the use of a\nsimulation (whether on educational or resource\ngrounds) then the information in these chapters\nwill help.\nThe strong opening is developed in the 'middle\ngame'. Making heavy use of examples and case\nstudies (one of the book's main strengths) the\nauthors explore the use of simulations and\ngames in each of four age brackets: nursery,\nlower primary, upper primary\/lower secondary\nand upper secondary. Each has its own chapter\n(Chapters 4-7), each with a tripartite structure.\nEach opens with a brief discussion of the\neducational needs of the age group, then covers\nhow appropriate simulations and games may be\nintegrated into the curricula, and ends with a\nnumber of case studies (often with enough detail\nto be able to run the simulation for oneself).\nCollectively, these chapters offer both depth and\nbreadth of insight into how simulations and\ngames can work with almost any learning\nmaterial, from simple association and\nsequencing at nursery level, through personal\nhealth care at primary level, to accounting and\neconomic principles at upper secondary level,\nand beyond. In the process they illustrate the\npractical aspects of running simulations in the\nclassroom.\nThe 'end game' (Chapters 8-10) is equally\nstrong, offering guidance on adapting or\ndeveloping simulations. Two approaches are\nexplored. Chapter 8 looks at the 'top-down' or\nalgorithmic approach in which the learning\nobjectives and basic design criteria are specified\nfirst, followed by decisions on content and\nformat (e.g. card game, board game, computer\nbased game, role play, etc.), and ending with the\ndevelopment of a total package (manuals,\ninstructions, playing materials, etc.). Chapter 9\noutlines the alternative, 'bottom-up', more\ninspirational approach to development. Here the\ndeveloper uses an existing 'technology' as\ninspiration (e.g. Monopoly, Scrabble, Trivial\nPursuits, etc.) and builds an educational\nexperience on familiar foundations. The authors'\nuse of simple examples (e.g. a 'health' game\nbased on the 'Snakes and Ladders' principle)\nmake the ideas very accessible and only a little\nlateral thinking is needed to understand how\nsuch ideas might be applied at any educational\nlevel. Chapter 10 addresses today's educational\n'holy grail' - a truly student-centred approach to\nlearning. This final chapter explains how to\ninvolve students in the simulation design and\ndevelopment process whereby the learning\nexperience is not limited to participation in the\n71\nReviews\ngame but is extended to understanding and\nmodelling of the process needed to develop the\ngame.\nThe book ends (as a good practical text should)\nby offering guidance to those wishing to further\ntheir interest in simulations through a very\nuseful (although not comprehensive) list of\nadditional readings and a list of contact\naddresses for publishers of the 32 simulations\nreferred to in the text.\nLike most introductory texts it has its limitations\nalthough in this case they are relatively minor.\nFirstly, it is clearly targeted at the primary and\nsecondary teacher. However, Chapters 8 to 10\nclearly demonstrate how simple formats can be\nextended to any educational level. Secondly,\nmost examples are drawn from the authors' own\nexperience of integrating simulations into the\nScottish educational system. However, this offers\na very complete illustration of how easily local\nindustries can be used as a basis for (say) a\nbusiness studies simulation. A little lateral\nthinking is all that is needed for the simulations\nto be adapted for use in any area, educational\nsystem, or at any level (and some will transfer\ndirectly). In the final analysis, the primary and\nsecondary education focus does not limit the\nusefulness of this book to teachers in just those\nsectors. If this book has one real oversight, it is\nin its limited coverage of the more sophisticated,\ncomputer-based simulations, more often used in\nhigher education and training, although even\nthis limitation is partially addressed through the\nlistings in the bibliography. In addition, given the\ncost and resource requirements of these simula-\ntions, the vast range of available simulations,\nand the book's focus on the primary and\nsecondary education sectors, this oversight can\nbe forgiven.\nOverall, this a very practical, well-written,\naccessible and readable book, which offers a\nfascinating introduction to the use of\nsimulations in education, and has four very\nstrong attributes that recommend it to teachers\nat all levels:\n1. It offers a sound framework for classifying\nsimulations, games and case studies.\n2. It provides justification for and guidance on\nusing-simulations and games for educational\npurposes.\n3. It is full of examples and practical\nillustrations of simulations and games in use\nin the classroom.\n72\n4. It offers highly practical and easily imple-\nmented suggestions on how a teacher might\ndevelop course-specific simulations and\ngames.\nFor anyone new to, or interested in, alternative\nlearning technologies or simulations and gaming\nin education, this book will make a useful\naddition to their library. It certainly makes a\nuseful contribution to the literature in both\nfields.\nDavid C. Arnott, University of Warwick\nN. Longworth and W. K. Davies, Lifelong\nLearning - New Vision, New Implications, New\nRoles for People Organisations, Nations And\nCommunities in the Twenty-first Century,\nLondon: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN: 0-7494-1972-\n5. A5 paperback, xiil79 pages. \u00a318.99.\nThis book was first published in 1996 but has\nsince been reprinted. It is an interesting publica-\ntion in that it provides many useful perspectives\non the currently popular topic of 'lifelong\nlearning'. Those who are new to this area would\nfind the nine chapters and three appendices in\nthis book a useful introduction to the subject.\nHowever, because it is now almost three years\nold, this volume does not cover the latest trends\nand developments that are now taking place in\nthis exciting area. The book is not a technical\none; it deals, instead, with the important ideas,\nconcepts and educational philosophies relating\nto learning as an ongoing, lifetime process and\nactivity in which anyone and everyone can\nparticipate.\nFollowing two Forewords and an Introduction,\nthe first chapter of the book serves to introduce\nthe concept of lifelong learning. It defines and\ndiscusses the meaning of the term and outlines\nthe basic nature of this approach to self-\nimprovement. A strong case is made for adopt-\ning the central ideas underlying lifelong learning\nin all aspects of life, work and family. In the\nfollowing chapter the authors introduce eight\nparadigm changes that they feel will be necessary\nin order to facilitate this mechanism of peda-\ngogy in the forthcoming 'lifelong learning age of\nthe 21st century'. Chapter 2 also identifies four\nimportant trends for enabling lifelong learning\nand then goes on to discuss a learner's charter -\nbased on the ELLI principles of learning; ELLI\nis an acronym for the European Lifelong\nLearning Initiative.\nThe following three chapters describe and debate\nAdi-J VWume 7 Number I\ndifferent approaches to the realization and\npromotion of lifelong learning. Chapter 3\n(entitled 'Where Lifelong Learning Begins')\ndiscusses the roles that schools can play in\n'seeding' and nurturing the development of\nsound lifelong learning principles and\ntechniques while chapter 4 ('Learning for\nEarning: Learning for Survival') is concerned\nwith work-place activities relating to the\nrealization of personal empowerment using this\nmechanism of\" study. Chapter 5 deals with\n'Learning Organisations' and how interest in\nthese has grown during the last decade or so. The\nrationale underlying this approach to lifelong\nlearning has been motivated by the potential it\noffers for improving an organization's perform-\nance through 'the development of the human\npotential in the workforce'. As well as listing and\ndiscussing the ten chief characteristics of a\nlearning organization, this chapter also includes\na case study based on the Rover Group in the\nUK. Two important recommendations put for-\nward by this case study are: 'personal empower-\nment in industry demands certain responses\nfrom schools, universities and colleges... some\nserious thinking needs to be done on the sorts of\nlifetime skills, curriculum content and learn-\ning methodologies that these organisations\nencourage' (p. 83); and 'Schools, universities and\ncolleges must also become learning organiza-\ntions, learning from the experience of industry,\nthe requirements of employability and the\ndemands of the wider society' (p. 84).\nBearing in mind what was said above, the two\nsubsequent chapters then discuss how various\ngroups might respond to the need to promote\nlifelong learning on a wider and more effective\nbasis. Chapter 6 is therefore concerned with the\nrole of teachers and teacher-training organiza-\ntions as 'change agents' in the context of\npromoting human development. It discusses\nissues of teacher education and how this can\ncontribute to the urgent need for promoting\nlifelong learning skills both in schools and in the\ncommunity. Chapter 7 then considers some of\nthe challenges and opportunities ' offered by\nvarious approaches to the realization of lifelong\nlearning in higher education. Particular\nemphasis is given to the roles that universities\nshould play. These roles are embedded within\n(and illustrated by means of) a conceptual model\nthat reflects the central co-ordinating function\nthat universities could perform in facilitating the\ncreation of various types of learning community.\nIn this chapter the authors provide a list of\nimportant areas where useful future research is\nneeded and might be conducted; they also\nemphasize the importance of university\/industry\npartnerships.\nIn chapter 8 ('Lifelong Learning and the Quality\nof Life') the authors start off by discussing\nvarious mechanisms for the creation of learning\ncommunities and how these could in turn form\nthe basis of a 'Learning Society'. They then\nbring together many of the threads of previous\nchapters into a set of actions to stimulate the\nwider vision of a learning society. Chapter 9 (the\n'Valediction') is a relatively short one. It\ndiscusses some of the more important learning\nchallenges that we will need to face in the\nforthcoming learning age. Throughout the book,\nfrequent reference is made to ELLI's Action\nAgenda for Lifelong Learning. This arose as an\noutcome from the First Global Conference on\nLifelong Learning; it is documented in some\ndetail in Appendix 1. The second appendix gives\ndetails of WILL (the World Initiative on\nLifelong Learning) while Appendix 3 describes\n'Odyssey of the Mind' - an international\nschools' tournament that is designed to promote\nthe skills of lifelong learning in school children.\nHaving read this book from cover to cover, I\nwould willingly recommend to it to anyone who\nwants to find out more about lifelong learning\nand its implications for the design of future\neducational systems. This is both a visionary and\na seminal book. It is therefore not surprising that\nit was chosen for distribution to delegates at the\ntheme conference of the European Year of\nLifelong Learning in 1996. Looking back, in\nretrospect, I believe the essential messages em-\nbedded in this book are probably best summed\nup by two quotations taken from it: 'What we\nhave tried to describe in this book is the end of\neducation and training and the beginning of the\nera of lifelong learning' (p. 145); and 'Lifelong\nlearning will be essential for everyone as we\nmove into the 21st Century and has to be made\naccessible to all' (p. 23).\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nLeslie Rae, Using People Skills in Training and\nDevelopment, London: Kogan Page, 1998. ISBN:\n0-7494-2575-X. Paperback, vii243 pages. \u00a319.99.\nAnyone associated with technology in education\nis acutely aware of what is coming to be called\nthe 'crisis in support'. Machines do not repair\nthemselves (yet), nor does software install itself,\nor a network administer itself. Worse, users do\n73\nReviews\nnot learn how to use complex hardware and\nsoftware by osmosis. Rather end-users need to\nbe assisted and trained, and a growing number\nof computer assistants need, themselves, to be\ntrained.\nThis is where Using People Skills can help. The\nbook applies psychological models of inter-\npersonal relations to the training process. To give\na notion of the book's scope, some of the models\ncovered include Kolb's Learning Cycle, Maslow's\nHierarchy, the Hertzberg Approach, the\nJohari Window, Behaviour Analysis, T-Groups,\nTransactional Analysis, Neuro-Linguistic Pro-\ngramming, and the Beblin Model.\nThe book is written in a general format, and\ncould apply to any organization in which\nmanagers must train subordinates. I approached\nthe book as the manager of a higher education\ncomputing laboratory, with the need to train a\nteam of students to act as peer consultants who\nhelp other students and staff use the lab.\nTeaching my consultants the details of hardware\nand software is not sufficient. If I can also help\nimprove my consultants' 'people skills' they will\nbe more effective in their jobs helping others.\nThe first half of this book is titled 'Com-\nmunication Aspects of People Skills', and\nconsists of five chapters, entitled 'Communica-\ntion', 'People Differences', 'Communication and\nBehaviour', 'Observing Behaviour', and 'Other\nMethods of Observing People'. The principal\nfocus is on communication and recognizing the\nbest way to reach an audience. The idea that\ndifferent people learn in different ways is\nstressed, and Rae cites a number of ideas from\neducational psychology. He warns that the\nattention span of trainees is typically no more\nthan 20 minutes, and in 'chalk-and-talk' train-\ning, attention may wane in ten minutes or less. In\nwriting the book, Rae follows his own advice. He\nkeeps his sections short and to the point, and\nfrequently breaks up the text with the equivalent\nof overhead slides - indeed he suggests that his\nboxed lists and summaries might be useful\nvisuals if the reader wishes to present this\nmaterial in a training session for trainers.\nThe second half of the book is collectively tided\n'Specific Aspects of People Skills', and has eight\nchapters: two on 'Coaching Skills', one each on\n'Delegating and Mentoring', 'Role Plays', 'Some\nGroup Approaches to People Skills', 'Team\nBuilding and Development', and two chapters\non 'Dealing with Difficult People'. The book\nconcludes with a list of over 100 references on\n74\ntraining and people skills, usefully grouped into\ntwelve categories.\nAs an example of the theoretical nature of the\nbook, in chapter 5 ('Observing Behaviour'), Rae\ndiscusses 'Behaviour Analysis' (BA). After going\nthrough a brief history of BA, he describes the\npractice, which consists of an observer scoring a\nnumber of trainees simultaneously in up to\nsixteen categories of behaviour. Clearly such\nanalysis requires considerable skill and\nexperience and is not appropriate for readers\nwho, rather than being behaviour analysts, have\nhad training responsibilities thrust upon them. I\nwas a bit disappointed here and elsewhere that\nthe chapter is not more practical. I would prefer\nto see more explanation for why this technique,\nor others Rae discusses elsewhere in the book,\nshould be used. After observing and recording,\nwhich behaviours are preferred, and which are to\nbe discouraged? How can the trainer affect\nchanges in trainee behaviour? Rae stops short of\ngiving this sort of practical advice.\nFor all of the theory in the book, I found some\nuseful pointers to help in organizing training\nsessions. The elaboration of different methods\nby which people learn, covered in chapter 3, is\nimportant to keep in mind in designing training\nsessions. Effective training should allow trainees\nto absorb material in a way that most suits them.\nThe chapter on 'Team Building' was also quite\nhelpful. In the area of learning technology, it is\nlikely that individuals will have specialized skills.\nIn order to provide help to end-users, a team of\nconsultants will need to work well together, and\nbuilding an effective team should be a high\npriority for the trainer.\nAnother useful pointer I gleaned from the book\ncomes in the introductory chapter. Rae\nadvocates that trainees be encouraged\/required\nto maintain a 'learning log' throughout the\ntraining process. A learning log is essentially a\nstructured note-taking process consisting of\nthree parts. The first part is the raw notes taken\nby a trainee during training. The second part is a\nmore thoughtful rendering of the notes, in which\nthe important points are summarized and\nperhaps elaborated. Finally, the third part of the\nlog is a set of implementation decisions, detail-\ning how the trainee is going to put the newly\nacquired knowledge to work. Along with the log,\nRae advocates setting aside time, at least daily\nduring training, when trainees compare their\nnotes to discover possible gaps in their\nunderstanding, and to see how others have\nAu-J Vfo\/ume 7 Number I\nprioritized the preceding lessons. In the field of\ntechnical consulting, these logs compiled by\ntrainees, along with handouts would become a\nbasic reference manual in which concepts are\nexplained in the trainee's own words.\nIn all, I found the book to be rather more\ntheoretical than I had expected, or that I need in\nmy role as a trainer, with relatively few specific\npractices to recommend. In particular, I found it\na bit surprising to find almost no mention of the\nuse of computer technology in the training\nprocess (but then, the book is about people\nskills). The book is pitched as a general overview\nof a wide variety of training theories, which\nshould be quite useful to the full-time\nprofessional trainer. To such a person, the book\nwould serve as an introduction or review of\nmany psychological models of teaching and\nlearning. Some background in educational\npsychology would probably be helpful to gain\nmaximum advantage from the book.\nJ. Douglass Klein, Union College, New York,\nUSA\n75\n"}
