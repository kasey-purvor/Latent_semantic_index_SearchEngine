Introduction\nExplaining the origin and evolution of solar flares is essential if we wish to gain\na complete understanding of the dynamic nature of the solar atmosphere. Many\ncontending theories have been put forward to account for solar flare initiation,\nincluding loss of equilibrium (Klimchuk and Sturrock, 1989, and Priest and Forbes,\n1990), tether cutting (Moore et al., 2001), the effect of the kink instability (To\u00a8ro\u00a8k\net al., 2004, and Gerrard and Hood, 2003) and the magnetic breakout model. Each of\nthese theories has been developed over the course of several years and has undergone\nintense scrutiny in the attempt to find the most accurate model for the onset of a\nsolar flare. It is fair to say that the debate is still open.\nHere we choose to further study and develop the magnetic breakout model, as\nfirst proposed by Antiochos, DeVore and Klimchuk (1999). In this model, a central\nflux system is initially enclosed by an overlying arcade. Shear is applied near a\nneutral line in the photosphere, causing magnetic reconnection to take place in the\nvicinity of a magnetic null point in the corona. This weakens the overlying field and\nallows the originally enclosed flux to \u201cbreak out\u201d explosively.\nFurther work by Antiochos (1998) showed that the simplest configuration with\nsufficient complexity to allow this behaviour is the delta sunspot. A delta sunspot\nArticle submitted to Royal Society TEX Paper\n2 R. Maclean and others\nconsists of two opposite-polarity sunspot umbrae contained within a common penum-\nbra. Indeed, such a configuration is observed to be a prolific producer of flares;\nTanaka (1991), for example, showed that significant flares were produced by 90%\nof delta groups with inverted polarity (see also Zhang, 1995).\nIn this paper, we will model a delta sunspot using the principles of magnetic\ncharge topology, or MCT (Longcope, 1996). MCT is based on three principal sim-\nplifying assumptions, justified in that paper:\n\u2022 Magnetic flux concentrations in the photosphere are represented as point\nsources.\n\u2022 These sources are assumed to lie in the plane z = 0, representing the photo-\nsphere, with the corona considered to be the half-space z > 0.\n\u2022 The magnetic field is approximated by a potential or linear force-free field.\nWhat is the value of such an MCT model by comparison with the full dy-\nnamic MHD breakout model of Antiochos, DeVore and Klimchuk (1999)? There\nare several issues here. The idea is that a slow evolution of a pre-eruptive magnetic\nconfiguration (through a series of equilibria in response to, for instance, photo-\nspheric footpoint motions or flux emergence) leads to a dynamic eruptive phase in\nwhich the magnetic field breaks out. Although the slow pre-eruptive evolution can\nbe described accurately by studying a series of equilibria, the dynamic phase itself\nneeds the full resistive MHD equations. Work done by Zhang and Low (2001) and\nZhang and Low (2003) has given us a more complete physical picture of the full\neruption, right through the initial, dynamical, and final relaxed states. However, so\nfar, the breakout model is a largely numerical one, and so it is important to try to\ndevelop a deeper understanding of the conditions for the initiation of the eruptive\nphase. What are the conditions for onset? What are the topological features of the\npre-eruptive and post-eruptive configurations? It is our purpose to try to shed a\nlittle light on these questions by using the MCT model, while recognising that it\nwill not reproduce many of the detailed features of a fully dynamic model.\nUsing discrete sources is a key assumption in our analysis. It is a reasonable\nmodel when the major sources of flux are sunspots and also in the quiet Sun where\nmost of the photospheric flux is in the form of discrete isolated intense sources. It\nis only when the sources are discrete that the notion of different topologies - i.e.,\nregions where there are different sources of flux separated by separatrix surfaces\nthat intersect in separators - comes into its own. If the photospheric flux, on the\nother hand, were continuously distributed everywhere, then there would be only\none source, namely, the whole (positively signed, say) photosphere. Nevertheless,\nit was recognised by Priest and De\u00b4moulin (1995) and later developed by De\u00b4moulin\net al. (1996) and Titov et al. (2002) that, even when the sources are continous, there\ncan sometimes be remnants of separatrices and separators (called quasi-separatrix\nlayers and quasi-separators) at which the mapping gradient is large rather than\ndiscontinuous and which behave in very similar ways to their discrete counterparts.\nAlthough the magnetic field in much of the corona is likely to be close to poten-\ntial, this is not true at low altitudes or in sheared structures such as prominences\nor the delta sunspots studied here. Due to either flux emergence or movement of\nfootpoint locations, the coronal field can gain a net twist which probably remains\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 3\ntrapped there as a result of the high magnetic Reynolds number in the corona. This\nis not dealt with by the potential field model. However, it is often true (Longcope\nand Magara, 2004) that the positions of topological features as calculated using\nMCT closely approximate the positions found by a full MHD simulation. At the\nvery least, the features present in an MCT model provide an invaluable guide for\nunderstanding results gained from more complex nonlinear force-free or full MHD\nsimulations. Also, it is much easier to explore a wider range of parameter space\nwith the MCT model. Having said this, clearly the energy released in flares must\ncome from a non-potential field if the photospheric normal magnetic field compo-\nnent remains constant during a flare. Typically, the difference between estimates\nof active region energies and those of a potential field with the same photospheric\nmagnetic field are small, of the order of 15% (e.g. Gary et al. (1987) find a difference\nof around 10%, while Klimchuk and Sturrock (1992) find 20%).\nMCT models the field\u2019s topology, defined as the property which is invariant un-\nder continuous deformation. Thus the topology of a potential field will be identical\nto the topologies of all non-potential fields with sufficiently small current densities.\nWhen the current density becomes large enough to change the topology, this change\nmust occur as a bifurcation. The same bifurcation can, however, occur in a con-\ntinuous sequence of potential fields, although the exact parameter values at which\nchanges between topological states occur will naturally change depending on the\nform of \u03b1(r) (Brown and Priest, 2000). The present work concerns that particular\nbifurcation leading to magnetic breakout when the field is sheared. For simplicity\nwe choose to characterise this bifurcation first in a sequence of potential fields and\nlater to demonstrate the identical bifurcation in non-potential fields.\nIn view of this, we choose to consider initially a magnetic field such that B = \u2212\u2207\u03a6,\nwhere \u03a6 is a scalar potential. We can then write the field explicitly at any point in\nthe corona due to n point sources in the solar surface with magnetic field strengths\n\u00b2i at positions ri (i = 1, . . . , n). At position r it is given by\nB(r) =\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\u00b2i\nr \u2212 ri\n|r \u2212 ri|3\n. (1.1)\nPoints where the magnetic field vanishes are called null points, and have been\nstudied in detail by Parnell et al. (1996). A system of coordinates can be found such\nthat the first-order linear field near any null point can be written as B = M \u00b7 r where\nr = (x, y, z)T and\nM =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2202Bx\n\u2202x\n\u2202Bx\n\u2202y\n\u2202Bx\n\u2202z\n\u2202By\n\u2202x\n\u2202By\n\u2202y\n\u2202By\n\u2202z\n\u2202Bz\n\u2202x\n\u2202Bz\n\u2202y\n\u2202Bz\n\u2202z\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n1 1\n2\n(q \u2212 j\u2016) 0\n1\n2\n(q \u2212 j\u2016) p 0\n0 j\u22a5 \u2212(p+ 1)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (1.2)\nHere j\u2016 and j\u22a5 are the currents parallel and perpendicular to the spine of the null\npoint (defined below), while p and q are parameters of the potential field. In the\npotential case which we will consider, j\u2016 and j\u22a5 vanish.\nIn view of the solenoidal condition (\u2207 \u00b7 B = 0), the trace of M (and hence the\nsum of the eigenvalues) must vanish. In the potential case, all three eigenvalues are\nreal; ignoring the degenerate cases where one or three eigenvalues vanish, it is clear\nthat one eigenvalue (\u03bb1) must be of opposite sign to the other two (\u03bb2 and \u03bb3). The\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n4 R. Maclean and others\neigenvector (e\u02c61) associated with \u03bb1 defines an isolated field line called the spine;\nthe other two eigenvectors (e\u02c62 and e\u02c63) define the fan plane of the null point (Priest\nand Titov, 1996); field lines beginning in the fan plane form the separatrix surface.\nThese, along with the separators (defined below) constitute the skeleton of the\nnull point (Priest et al., 1997). The skeleton of a magnetic configuration consists of\nthe extensions of the skeletons of all of its null points.\nThe null is classified as positive if \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 are positive, and negative otherwise.\nThe spines of a positive null point begin at positive sources and end at the null;\nthose beginning at a negative null point end at negative sources. In either case,\nthese sources are the null\u2019s spine sources; if they are distinct, the null is heterospinal,\nwhereas if both spines end at the same source, the null is homospinal (Beveridge,\n2003). In addition, if the spine of a null point lies in the photospheric plane, it is\nlabelled prone, as opposed to upright if the spine is perpendicular to it, or coronal\nif it lies outwith the photosphere (Longcope and Klapper, 2002).\nThe separatrix surface of a heterospinal null divides space into different regions\nof connectivity, or flux domains. Field lines on either side of the surface will begin\n(or end) at the spine sources of the null.\nA separator is a field line connecting a positive and a negative null point. It is the\nthree-dimensional analogue of a two-dimensional X-point and is a prime location for\nreconnection (Greene, 1988; Lau and Finn, 1990; Priest and Titov, 1996; Galsgaard\nand Nordlund, 1997). Separators also generally lie along the boundaries between\nfour different regions of connectivity \u2013 at least for separators connecting heterospinal\nnulls. Such a separator is called a proper separator. It can be shown that a separator\nlinks two null points if and only if the separatrix of one contains both spines of the\nother (Beveridge, Brown and Priest, 2004). If a null point has no separators, its fan\nplane is referred to as unbroken; otherwise it is known as broken (Longcope and\nKlapper, 2002).\nThe numbers of various elements of a field\u2019s skeleton are linked by several re-\nlationships. In a situation with flux balance, the field at a great distance from the\nsources is approximately dipolar. On a contour of sufficiently large diameter, the\nKronecker-Poincare\u00b4 index (\u03c7) of the field will be two (Molodenskii and Syrovatskii,\n1977). The Euler characteristic equation\nM \u2212 c+m = \u03c7 (1.3)\nthen holds in the photospheric plane. Here M is the number of potential maxima\n(see, for instance, Inverarity and Priest (1999); m is the number of minima, and c\nis the number of saddle points. Saddle points of the potential correspond to prone\nnulls; maxima (respectively, minima) correspond either to positive (respectively,\nnegative) sources or to positive (respectively, negative) upright nulls. This allows\nus to relate the numbers of sources (S), prone nulls (np) and upright nulls (nu) by\nthe two-dimensional Euler characteristic:\nS + nu = np + 2, (1.4)\nwhich holds when the net flux in the source plane is zero. The properties of nulls\nin 3D space are governed by the 3D Euler characteristic:\nS+ \u2212 n+ = S\u2212 \u2212 n\u2212, (1.5)\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 5\nwhere S\u00b1 represents the number of positive or negative sources and n\u00b1 the number\nof positive or negative nulls. In both of these equations, flux balance is assumed:\nfor an unbalanced case, it is necessary to add a balancing source at a great distance\nand increase S, as well as S+ or S\u2212 appropriately.\nLongcope and Klapper (2002) found a relationship between the number of flux\ndomains (D), separators (X), null points (n) and sources (S):\nD = X \u2212 n+ S, (1.6)\nwhere n excludes homospinal nulls and nulls with unbroken fans. However, this\nresult applies to the whole of space rather than to the coronal half-space. For a\nresult in the latter, we must differentiate between photospheric domains, which\ncontain field lines which lie in the photosphere, and purely coronal domains, which\ndo not. Making this distinction, we can modify the equation to:\nD\u03c6 + 2Dc = 2X \u2212 n\u03c6 \u2212 2nc + S, (1.7)\nwhere D\u03c6 is the number of photospheric domains, Dc the number of purely coro-\nnal domains, n\u03c6 the number of photospheric nulls and nc the number of coronal\nnulls (Beveridge, 2003). Again, homospinal nulls and nulls with unbroken fans are\nexcluded.\nBy changing the source strengths and positions of the sources, it is possible to\nforce a change from one topological state to another - for instance by creating a\npair of null points, or by allowing two separatrix surfaces to intersect, giving rise\nto a separator. Several different types of bifurcation are possible, in two distinct\nclasses:\n\u2022 local bifurcations in which the number of nulls changes. Local bifurcations\ncan, and usually do, have global effects;\n\u2022 global bifurcations in which the structure of the field changes, but the number\nof nulls does not.\nThe final tools of MCT which we will require are the domain and null graphs,\nintroduced by Longcope (2001) and Longcope and Klapper (2002) respectively. The\ndomain graph has as vertices all of the flux sources; a pair of vertices is connected\nif and only if field lines connect the two flux sources they represent. The null graph\nhas as its vertices all of the null points; two vertices are connected if and only if the\nnull points they represent are connected by a separator. With these tools at our\ndisposal, it is possible to catalogue quite complex topologies with some confidence.\nAs an illustrative example, the skeleton of a typical three-source state (Brown\nand Priest, 1999a), the intersecting state, is shown in Figure 1(a). Its domain and\nnull graphs are also given in Figure 1(b). The topology consists of one positive\nand two negative sources, plus the balancing source required at infinity. The two\nnegative sources are fairly close together; their combined strength is greater than\nthe strength of the positive source, so a separatrix dome is formed. A separatrix wall\nalso exists, between the two negative sources and stretching off to infinity in either\ndirection, which intersects the dome (hence the name of the state). Two null points\nare formed; a negative one between the two negative sources and a positive one\nat the opposite end of the dome. A separator links the nulls; it is the intersection\nbetween the separatrix surfaces.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n6 R.

P stands for positive source, N for negative source, B for positive\nnull and A for negative null. (This is the standard notation). In the domain\ngraph, two sources are linked if they share flux; in the null graph, two nulls\nare linked if they are joined by a separator.\nIn the following section, we will outline our simple model for a delta sunspot,\ndetail the numerical experiments which were undertaken and analyse the global\nspine-fan bifurcation, which \u00a73 will show to be responsible for most of the topologi-\ncal breakout behaviour observed. We will conclude with a discussion of our results.\n2. Model and Bifurcation Analysis\nWe model a delta sunspot with an unbalanced six-source configuration. Table 1 and\nFigure 2 show the initial arrangement of sources used. The positions and strengths\ngiven are all relative numbers. A central, positive source is surrounded by three\nnegative sources, which are in turn flanked by two strong positive sources. This\nsimulates the emergence of a new area of positive flux into a pre-existing simple\nsunspot configuration, to form a delta spot.\nIn this initial state, all the flux from P1 goes to N1, N2 and N3; none of it\nconnects out to N\u221e, the balancing source at infinity. It is prevented from doing\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 7\nSource Position Strength\nP1 (0, 0) \u00b2\nN1 (0, 1) \u22121\nN2 (0.866,\u22120.5) \u22121\nN3 (\u22120.866,\u22120.5) \u22121\nP2 (0,\u22123) 2.5\nP3 (2.5, 1.5) 2.5\nTable 1: Initial source positions and strengths for our model\nso by the presence of two separatrix domes which entirely enclose the flux in the\ncentral region. The outer dome is formed by the separatrix surface of the null\nA1, which touches the photosphere along the circuit A1\u2013P3\u2013B1\u2013P2\u2013A1. The inner\ndome consists of the separatrix surfaces of the coronal nulls B2 and B3; they touch\nalong the spine N1\u2013A5\u2013N2, and the whole dome is bounded in the photosphere by\nthe circuit A2\u2013N1\u2013A4\u2013N2\u2013A3\u2013N3\u2013A2.\nThe topological manifestation of a breakout is the addition of a flux domain\nconnecting the central, originally enclosed source to the balancing source at infinity.\nWe shall attempt to provoke such behaviour by disturbing the configuration in three\nways:\n\u2022 by altering the strength of the central source in a potential field, from just\nabove 0 up to 2;\n\u2022 by altering the location of the central source in a potential field, within a 2\u00d72\nsquare centred on the origin; and\n\u2022 by altering the parameter \u03b1 of a force-free field, while keeping P1 fixed near\nthe origin with \u00b2 = 1.5.\nEach progression is marked by a sequence of bifurcations at which the field\u2019s topo-\nlogy changes. Each bifurcation can be classified as either local or global, as described\nin \u00a71. In a local bifurcation the number of nulls changes, but the connectivity of the\nfield remains unchanged, i.e. the domain graph is unaffected. This is an essential,\nand indeed defining, property of a local bifurcation. Of course, the creation of new\nnull points means new separatrix surfaces also appearing in the topology, but these\ncannot be created in such a way as to change the existing domain structure. Local\nbifurcations do, however, change the number of proper separators, X, according to\n\u2206X = \u2206nc +\n1\n2\n\u2206n\u03c6 (local bifurcation). (2.1)\nThis is the difference of Equation 1.7 after noting that \u2206S = \u2206D = 0. It is a general\nrule which tells us about the effect which a local bifurcation will have on a given\ntopology, and can be applied to predict the change in the number of separators we\nshould expect to find, given information about the number of null points created or\ndestroyed. The change in the number of photospheric nulls, \u2206n\u03c6 = \u2206n++\u2206n\u2212, will\nalways be an even number since the difference of Equation 1.5 yields \u2206n+ = \u2206n\u2212.\n(Upright nulls are always homospinal nulls and are therefore not counted among\nphotospheric nulls in equation 1.7).\nAlthough it is not yet possible to directly observe the topological structure of\nthe corona, various techniques to reconstruct it from photospheric magnetic field\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n8 R.

Rules such as this one for local bifurcations provide a useful check\non the accuracy of these reconstructions. Indeed, in the future it may become\npossible to observe separatrices and separators in the corona, due to the large\ncurrent accumulations expected there (McLaughlin and Hood, 2004), in which case\nsuch rules would come into their own.\nThe term breakout refers to the creation of a new domain connecting to distant\nsources. This must occur as a global bifurcation, since local bifurcations do not\nchange the domain structure. In all three cases we consider, this new domain can be\ncreated through a global spine-fan bifurcation (Brown and Priest, 1999a). In a global\nspine-fan bifurcation the spine of one null sweeps across the fan of a second, like-\nsigned null. In the example shown in Figure 3 the spine connecting null B2 to source\nP2 approaches null B1 (Figure 3(a)). At the instant of bifurcation (Figure 3(b)) the\nspine actually joins the fan thereby connecting B2 to B1 in a structurally unstable\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 9\ntopology (Hornig and Schindler, 1996). Immediately following this, the spine of B2\nconnects to P1 as shown in Figure 3(c).\nN1\nB1 B2\nN1\nB1 B2\nN1\nB1 B2\nP1 P1\nP2\nP1\nP2\nN2 N2\nN2\nP2\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nFigure 3: An example of the global spine-fan bifurcation shown as a footprint in\nthe z = 0 plane, with positive sources P1 and P2, negative sources N1\nand N2, and positive nulls B1 and B2. Thick lines are spines, thin lines\nare the intersection of the separatrix surfaces with the z = 0 plane, and\nthe dotted line is a separator. This bifurcation is designated B2 a B1.\nA general global spine-fan bifurcation \u201cflips\u201d the spine \u03b3 of one null, call it S,\nbetween two sources. These sources are the two spine sources of the second null T\nacross whose fan \u03b3 has flipped. The global consequences of this bifurcation, which\nwe designate S a T , result from changing separators as follows. Each separator\nconnected to S will also connect to an opposing null S \u2032. One sector \u03a3 of the S\u2032\nfan will be bounded by this separator and the spine \u03b3 (Longcope and Klapper,\n2002). The fan sector \u03a3 remains bounded by \u03b3 even as it flips through the T fan;\nthe spine \u201cdrags\u201d the fan sector with it. Consider first a case where \u03a3 did not\nintersect the T fan before the bifurcation. The spine \u03b3 will then \u201cdrag\u201d the fan\nsector \u03a3 through the T fan as it flips, thereby introducing a new separator linking\nT to S\u2032 (the separator is the new intersection). Had such an intersection been\npresent before, the bifurcation would eliminate it (running the creation scenario in\nreverse), thereby destroying the T\u2013S \u2032 separator. In this manner the global spine-fan\nbifurcation S a T creates and destroys separators, changing their total number by\n\u2206X. Since neither the sources nor the nulls are affected\u2020, the number of domains\nmust change according to\n\u2206X = \u2206Dc +\n1\n2\n\u2206D\u03c6 (global bifurcation), (2.2)\n\u2020 There is an exception to this rule in cases where null T has an unbroken fan either before or\nafter the bifurcation. Nulls with unbroken fans are not counted in Equation 1.7. By changing its\nunbroken status the bifurcation effectively adds or removes the null making \u2206n = \u00b11.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n10 R. Maclean and others\nwhich is Equation 1.7 adapted to the case of global bifurcations. This gives us a\ngeneral rule to predict the number of separators produced or destroyed by such a\nbifurcation, when the domain structure is known.\nFollowing the description above we can also outline a general rule by which a\nglobal spine-fan bifurcation changes the the null graph. Bifurcation S a T involves\nnulls S and T (of the same sign) where one spine of S passes through the fan of T .\nLet S \u2032 be the set of opposing null points connected directly to S by separators; let\nT \u2032 be those nulls connected to T prior to the bifurcation. The set U \u2032 of null points\nwhich will be connected to T after bifurcation S a T is\nU \u2032 = (T \u2032\\S \u2032) \u222a (S \u2032\\T \u2032). (2.3)\nThe bifurcation will destroy each separator connecting T to a member of T \u2032\u2229S \u2032\nwhile creating new separators connecting T to each member of S \u2032\\T \u2032 .\nThis prescription can be used to predict the topological consequences of a known\nglobal spine-fan bifurcation or to verify that such a bifurcation has occurred. We\nwill make frequent use of this prescription in the analysis of our three evolutionary\nscenarios.\n3. Results\n(a) Changing the Source Strength\nAs the strength of the central source is increased from just above 0 up to 2 in\nrelative units, an interesting series of topological bifurcations takes place.\nIn the initial state with \u00b2 very small, the flux from P1 is constrained by the\npresence of two separatrix domes (see Figures 4(a) and 4(c)); the outer dome is\nthe separatrix surface of A1, and the inner dome is the separatrix surface of B2.\nWorking from Equation 1.7, we have n\u03c6 = 5, nc = 1, S = 7, and from the footprint\nin Figure 4, D\u03c6 = 10. There are no purely coronal domains, so D\u03c6 = 0 and therefore\nthere are X = 5 separators. This information is summarised in the domain and null\ngraphs, shown in Figure 4(b).\nThe first bifurcation to take place is the coronal local separator bifurcation. It\noccurs between \u00b2 = 1.21 and \u00b2 = 1.22, when the two separators A3\u2013B1 and A3\u2013B2\nare pushed together until they partially join, creating two new nulls of opposite\nsign in the corona, which we will call B3 and A5. The new topology is shown\nin Figure 5(a). The original separators A3\u2013B1 and A3\u2013B2 now no longer exist;\ninstead we have new separators joining A3\u2013B3, A5\u2013B1, A5\u2013B2 and A5\u2013B3. These\nnew null points give \u2206nc = 2 in Equation 2.1, which is balanced out by the change\nin separator count of \u2206X = 2.\nAt this point, the two domes constraining the flux from P1 still exist - the outer\ndome is unchanged, but the inner one is now a composite of the fan surfaces of\nB2 and B3. New domain and null graphs are shown in Figure 5(b). The domain\ngraph remains unaffected by the bifurcation as it is a local bifurcation, implying\nthat the structure of the flux domains stays the same, but the null graph changes\nsignificantly due to the creation and destruction of several separators, as mentioned\nabove.\nIncreasing the strength of P1 further, the next bifurcation happens when \u00b2\npasses 1.57. This is the global spine-fan bifurcation A5 a A1, and it causes breakout\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 11\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003 \u0000\u0006\u0005\u0007\u0003\nN\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nB1\nB2\nP1\nP2\nP3\nN1\nN2\nN3\n\u0000\t\b\n\u0003\nFigure 4: (a) The photospheric footprint when the central source strength \u00b2 is 0.7,\nbefore any bifurcations have taken place.\n(b) Domain graph (above) and null graph (below) for \u00b2 = 0.7.\n(c) A 3D view of the corresponding topology, showing the inner and outer\nseparatrix domes which constrain the flux from the central source.\nas anticipated.

The bifurcation itself happens\nwhen the spine of A5 and the fan of A1 approach one another, coincide, and then\nflip past one another, creating a new flux domain linking P1 to N\u221e.

New separators created in the bifurcation are shown\nas dashed lines.\ntopologically unstable. The new flux domain is purely coronal, which explains why\nthe bifurcation cannot be detected on the photospheric footprint.\nTo find the change in connectivity brought about by the global spine-fan bi-\nfurcation, we apply our rule from \u00a72. Here S is A5, T is A1, S \u2032 is {B1, B2, B3}\nand T \u2032 is {B1}. So after the bifurcation, A5 should be connected to the set of nulls\nU \u2032 = (T \u2032\\S \u2032)\u222a(S \u2032\\T \u2032), which here is {B2, B3}. This can be seen in the new domain\nand null graphs, given in Figure 6(c).\nWe also need to check that Equation 2.2 is still satisfied after this global bi-\nfurcation; we have \u2206Dc = 1, which is balanced by the fact that on the other side\n\u2206X = 1, so the equation is indeed satisfied.\nA final point to note regarding this topology is that, according to Longcope and\nKlapper (2002), a coronal domain such as the one produced by the global spine-fan\nbifurcation must be enclosed by a separator circuit. Prior to the global spine-fan\nbifurcation there were no separator circuits and therefore no coronal domains. The\npost-bifurcation null graph (Figure 6(c)), with X = 7 separators and n = 7 nulls,\ncontains X \u2212 n+ 1 = 1 separator circuit. This circuit is A1\u2013B2-A5\u2013B3\u2013A1 as can\nbe seen on Figure 6(c); it engirdles the new domain P1\u2013N\u221e as anticipated.\nIf we continue to increase the source strength, we find a local double separator\nbifurcation just after \u00b2 = 1.68. Coronal null B2 slides down its separator to merge\nwith its mirror coronal partner and the photospheric null A4.

The new topology\ncan be seen in Figure 7(a).\nDomain and null graphs are given in Figure 7(b). As the bifurcation is of local\ntype, the domain graph remains unchanged. Equation 2.1 tells us that since \u2206nc =\n\u22121, we should also have \u2206X = \u22121, i.e. the number of separators should decrease\nby 1. As predicted, the separator A4\u2013B2 disappears during the bifurcation.\nThe final bifurcation studied here occurs when \u00b2 passes 1.78; it is another local\ndouble separator bifurcation, almost a mirror of the previous one, caused by coronal\nnull B3 sliding down its separator onto photospheric null A3. We shall call the\nnew positive photospheric null thus created B3, to keep consistency of notation.\nFigure 8(a) shows the new topology.\nDomain and null graphs are given in Figure 8(b).

More bifurcations may occur, but they\nwill not be able to re-enclose the flux from P1, so we choose to end the experiment\nhere.\nFigure 9 is a bifurcation diagram, giving a summary of where in parameter\nspace the bifurcations occur, with the parameter in this case being the strength of\nthe central source. It is interesting to note that, as these topologies are calculated\nusing a potential field, if we were to start with a strong source and allow it to\ndecrease in strength, exactly the same bifurcations would occur at the same points\nin parameter space.\nSo breakout can indeed be caused by increasing the strength of the new source.\nIn the next section, we attempt to provoke breakout in a different way; by changing\nthe position of the new source.\n(b) Changing the Source Position\nIn this experiment there are two degrees of freedom, so, unlike the previous\nexperiment, there is no obvious order in which we can place the bifurcations that\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 15\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003 \u0000\u0006\u0005\u0007\u0003\nN\nB1\nB2A2\nA1\nA5 B3\nP1\nP2\nP3\nN1\nN2\nN3\nFigure 8: (a) The footprint at \u00b2 = 1.8, after the second local double separator\nbifurcation.

In the symmetric case, for example, the two global spine-fan bifurcation lines\nrunning from the centre towards the bottom right of the bifurcation diagram would\ncoincide.\nThe breakout topologies can be found in the shaded areas of the diagram. Many\npossible routes exist from the origin to a breakout topology. Indeed, it is believed\nthat, if the analysis were extended further out, eventually breakout would be ob-\nserved in all directions, as P1 moves far enough out from the centre to easily\nform a flux domain connecting itself to N\u221e.It is interesting to note that, although\nthe global spine-fan bifurcation is responsible for most of the breakout behaviour,\nbreakout can also be caused by the global separator bifurcation in some cases. Only\nglobal bifurcations can be responsible for breakout as only they can create the new\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 17\nflux domain required to connect P1 to N\u221e. Let us examine some examples of how\nthis can happen in more detail.\nFirstly, the global spine-fan bifurcation lines associated with breakout run from\napproximately (\u22120.8,\u22120.45) to (0, 0.9) and (0.4,\u22121) to (1, 0). They therefore ac-\ncount for most of the possible paths to breakout in the source configuration used.\nAs an example, consider moving across the line of bifurcation from (0.8,\u22120.2) to\n(1,\u22120.2). The two topologies are shown in Figures 11(a) and 11(b). All the nulls\nhere are prone, so the topology can be uniquely specified by its photospheric foot-\nprint.\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003 \u0000\u0006\u0005\u0007\u0003\nFigure 11: An example of the global spine-fan bifurcation causing breakout. The\nfootprints are shown when the central source is at (a) (0.8,\u22120.2), before\nthe global spine-fan bifurcation and (b) (1.0,\u22120.2), after the bifurcation.\nThe upper spine of B1 changes its connection from P3 to P1, while the\nlower fan trace of B2 changes its connection from N1 to N\u221e.\nThe actual bifurcation is the global spine-fan bifurcation B1 a B2, proceeding\nas follows. As P1 moves further right across the photosphere, the spine B1\u2013P3 and\nthe separatrix B2\u2013N2 are pushed closer and closer together, until they coincide at\nabout x = 0.9 in a global spine-fan bifurcation. After the bifurcation, the spine\nconnects B1\u2013P1 and the separatrix B2\u2013N\u221e.\nWe apply our separator rule to find changes to the topological structure; here,\nwith B1 as S and B2 as T , we see that S \u2032 = {A1, A3} and T \u2032 = {A2, A3}, giving\nU \u2032 = {A1, A2}. So the number of separators before and after the bifurcation is\nconstant at X = 5. Putting this into Equation 2.2 tells us that, as there are no\ncoronal domains, the number of photospheric domains should remain unchanged.\nThis is indeed the case; the bifurcation destroys the flux domain P3\u2013N2, while at\nthe same time creating a new flux domain P1\u2013N\u221e, the breakout domain.\nBreakout can also be achieved via a global separator bifurcation. On the bi-\nfurcation diagram (Figure 10), this can be seen in two places; an almost horizon-\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n18 R. Maclean and others\ntal line of bifurcation running between the intersection with the global spine-fan\nbifurcation line at (0, 0.9) and (0.4, 1), and an almost vertical line running be-\ntween (\u22120.5,\u22121) and the intersection with the global spine-fan bifurcation line\nat (\u22120.8,\u22120.6). Let us consider, as an example, the bifurcation involved in cross-\ning the line between (0.2, 0.9) and (0.2, 1.0). The relevant topologies are shown in\nFigures 12(a) and 12(b).\n\u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003 \u0000\u0006\u0005\u0007\u0003\nFigure 12: An example of the global separator bifurcation causing breakout. The\nfootprints are shown when the central source is at (a) (0.2, 0.9), before\nthe global separator bifurcation and (b) (0.2, 1.0), after the bifurcation.\nThe upper fan trace of A1 changes its connection from P3 to P1, while\nthe upper fan trace of B2 changes its connection from N3 to N\u221e.\nAs P1 moves up, the separatrices B2\u2013N3 and A1\u2013P3 are pushed closer together.\nAt the point of bifurcation they coincide, and then, as P1 continues to move, the\nbreakout takes place and the flux domain P1\u2013N\u221e is created. The separatrices\ninvolved in the bifurcation change connectivity; they now join B2\u2013N\u221e and A1\u2013\nP1.\nEquation 2.2 applies as we are dealing with a global bifurcation. This time we\nhave \u2206X = 1 as a new separator, A1\u2013B2, is created. The equation holds, because\n\u2206Dc = 1 as flux domain P3\u2013N3 is pushed up into the corona by the bifurcation,\nchanging its classification from photospheric to coronal. \u2206D\u03c6 = 0 because the\ncreation of the (photospheric) breakout domain P1\u2013N\u221e balances the loss of the\ndomain P3\u2013N3 to the corona.\nSo we have seen that breakout behaviour can be indeed provoked by moving\na newly emerging flux source across the photosphere, and that two distinct global\nbifurcations can be responsible for this effect. In the next section we work with\nforce-free instead of potential fields, to test whether breakout can be caused by\nchanging the parameter \u03b1 of the force-free field.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 19\n(c) Changing the Force-Free Parameter \u03b1\nA sequence of non-potential fields is likely to exhibit similar types of topological\nchange to the potential fields considered so far, provided they are not too far from\npotential. To demonstrate this, we construct linear force-free fields for the same\ndistribution of photospheric sources. Linear force-free fields are one step closer to\nreality than potential ones, allowing us to add helicity to the field, and so if the\nsame types of changes occur in both, then we can have a higher degree of confidence\nin the qualitative predictions of our model. Of course, a nonlinear force-free field\nwould be a better approximation still, but the complexity of such simulations leads\nus to consider the linear case for now. A disadvantage of linear force-free fields is\nthat they are energetically unbounded, but they can still give us a great deal of\ninformation about local field topologies.\nThe linear force-free field for a given \u03b1 is computed by summing up the contri-\nbutions of all sources; the contribution of each source is given by a Green\u2019s function\n(Chiu and Hilton, 1977). In the vicinity of its source the Green\u2019s function is radial\nand diverges as r\u22122, exactly as for the potential field. At distances beyond pi\/2|\u03b1|,\nhowever, the radial field oscillates, ultimately falling off only as r\u22121. Linear force-\nfree fields cannot therefore be used to model fields outside a distance pi\/2|\u03b1| from\neach source. We restrict our consideration to this region and refer to field lines\nexiting it as extending to \u2018infinity\u2019.\nSequences of equilibria in which |\u03b1| increases from zero show some of the same\nbifurcations explored in the previous sections, including, in some cases, breakout.\nThe particular distribution with \u00b2 = 1.5 and source P1 located at (\u22120.05, 0.05) is a\nuseful illustration. The bifurcation diagram, Figure 10, shows that the potential field\nhas the same topology as the case with P1 at the origin, whose footprint is shown\nin Figure 2. Three global spine-fan bifurcations occur as \u03b1 is made increasingly\nnegative beginning at zero. The first, A1 a A2, occurs at \u03b1 = \u22120.011. Since S \u2032 =\n{B1} and T \u2032 = {B2} we find that U \u2032 = {B1, B2}, implying the creation of the new\nseparator A2\u2013B1. This adds the photospheric domain, P2\u2013N1, and converts the\nphotospheric domain P3\u2013N3 into a coronal domain engirdled by the newly created\nseparator circuit A2\u2013B1\u2013A5\u2013B2\u2013A2.\nThe second bifurcation, A5 a A2, occurs at \u03b1 = \u22120.028. This destroys sepa-\nrators A2\u2013B1 and A2\u2013B2, and creates separator A2\u2013B3 (\u2206X = \u22121) destroying\nthe separator circuit and with it the coronal domain P3\u2013N3 (\u2206Dc = \u22121). The\nresulting topology is shown by the footprint 13(a) and graphs 13(b), for \u03b1 = \u22120.1.\nSource P1 now connects to N1, N2 and N3 in domains lying underneath a dome\nformed by the fan surfaces of B2 and B3 which join along the spines of coronal null\nA5.\nThe third global spine-fan bifurcation, A5 a A1, occurs at \u03b1 = \u22120.197, taking\nthe spine of A5 to \u201cinfinity\u201d (i.e. beyond r ' 7.5). The bifurcation destroys sep-\narator A1\u2013B1, and creates separators A2\u2013B1 and A3\u2013B1 (\u2206X = 1). This forms\na separator circuit A2\u2013B2\u2013A3\u2013B3\u2013A2 engirdling a new coronal domain, P1\u2013N\u221e,\nwhich is the breakout domain. Figure 14 shows field lines, for \u03b1 = \u22120.21, from the\nbreakout domain and two of the domains which had been under the dome prior to\nbreakout. Note that the sequence of three global spine-fan bifurcations, A1 a A2,\nA5 a A2 and A5 a A1, in the force-free evolution has accomplished the same topo-\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n20 R.

The manner in which the breakout proceeds is very similar\nto the previous potential field calculations, suggesting that a potential field gives a\ngood qualitative picture of the topological behaviour of our sunspot.\n4. Discussion\nAntiochos, DeVore and Klimchuk (1999)\u2019s conception of the magnetic breakout\nmodel is far more complex than can be expressed with a potential field, accounting\nas it does for the energy storage necessary in the run-up to a flare, since potential\nfields are incapable of storing excess energy. However, we have shown that our\nsimple potential field model of a delta sunspot can display topological breakout\nbehaviour in several distinct ways \u2014 by moving the flux sources or by altering the\nsource strengths. A slightly more complicated, linear force-free field model can also\nbe made to \u201cbreak out\u201d by altering the parameter \u03b1.\nWe have demonstrated that at least two different topological bifurcations can\nprovide a mechanism for breakout, both of them global: the global spine-fan bifurca-\ntion and the global separator bifurcation. In fact, it seems that breakout behaviour\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nTopological Analysis of Magnetic Breakout 21\nFigure 14: Field lines from a force-free field with the same source configuration as\n13, but \u03b1 = \u22120.21; beyond the break-out bifurcation. Green lines in the\nphotosphere are the spines of the photospheric nulls A1, A2 and A3. The\nred and blue field lines which close down to the photosphere are from\ndomains P1\u2013N2 and P1\u2013N3. The magenta field lines which extend out\nof the diagram to the top left are from P1\u2013N\u221e, the flux domain created\nby breakout.\nFigure 15: Two TRACE images of AR9574, showing the formation of a new mag-\nnetic connection between two previously separate regions of flux (from\nLongcope et al., 2005).\nis ubiquitous in our delta sunspot model; whichever parameter is varied, the system\ncan eventually make its way towards a breakout configuration.\nWe have also derived rules governing the number of separators created or de-\nstroyed in both local and global bifurcations (Equations 2.1 and 2.2), as well as a\nrule predicting the exact changes to the topological skeleton brought about by a\nglobal spine-fan bifurcation(Equation 2.3). Topological rules such as these are very\nuseful in checking that calculated topologies are indeed correct and self-consistent.\nIt is interesting to note that these results could also be applied to active re-\ngion structure, explaining how distant magnetic connections can appear suddenly\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n22 R. Maclean and others\nwhere there were none before. Figure 15 shows an example from TRACE of loop-\nlike structures forming to connect previously separated regions of flux in AR9574\n(Longcope et al., 2005). Our results suggest that this new flux domain forms as a\nresult of a global bifurcation; detailed modelling would be required to determine its\nexact nature.\nWe hope that this work will pave the way for a deeper topological understanding\nof the magnetic breakout model.\nWe are grateful to the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council for funding,\nand to the three anonymous referees for their helpful and insightful comments.\nReferences\nAntiochos, S.K.: 1998, \u201cThe magnetic topology of solar eruptions\u201d, Astrophys.
