The three views required to\nobtain three-component velocity information are guided\nfrom the collection optics to a single imaging plane using\nflexible fibre imaging bundles. These are made up of a\ncoherent array of single fibres and are combined at one\nend as the input plane to the measurement head.

With this in mind and with the advent of suitable\nhardware, new techniques to measure and investigate\nflows have been developed. One of these is planar Doppler\nvelocimetry (PDV) (Samimy and Wernet 2000), which is\nalso known in the literature as Doppler global velocimetry\n(DGV) (Meyers and Komine 1991).\nGeneral reviews of the development of PDV have\nhighlighted two themes in the development of the tech-\nnique (Samimy and Wernet 2000; Mosedale et al. 2000;\nElliot and Beutner 1999; Reinath 1997). The first is the\ndevelopment of systems for three-component velocity\nmeasurements over a plane using two-dimensional array\ncameras. The high cost of these devices has pushed\nresearchers to minimise the number used in the tech-\nnique. The second focuses on ongoing problems in the\ndevelopment of PDV on system stability and especially\nthe behaviour of the light source used. The latest\nimplementation of ideas into PDV and some of the latest\napplications are reported in a special issue of the journal\nMeasurement Science and Technology (Tropea 2001).\nBuilding on this work, this paper describes the development\nof a novel PDV system that addresses these two themes.\n2\nBackground\nThe theory of PDV is based on the Doppler principle that\nlight, when scattered from a moving object is frequency\nshifted depending on the velocity of that object. The\nDoppler formula describes the relationship between the\nvelocity of the object and the frequency shift of the light\nscattered from that object and can be expressed using the\nvector equation\nDt \u00bc to\nc\no \u0001 i\u00f0 \u00deV \u00f01\u00de\nHere, Dt=tD)to is the difference between the Doppler\nshifted frequency (tD) and the frequency of the light\nsource (to), c is the free space speed of light, V is the\nvelocity vector of the object that is scattering the light and\no is a unit direction vector to the viewer and i, the unit\ndirection vector of the light source. A physical interpre-\ntation of this equation can be developed for the three-\ndimensional case when the light source and the viewing\ndirection are not in the same plane, as shown in Fig. 1.\nFrom Eq. (1) it can be seen that to determine the ve-\nlocity of the scattering object, the Doppler shift of the\nscattered laser light needs to be determined as well as\nhaving knowledge of the propagation direction of the light\nsource and the direction from which the scattered signal is\ncollected. While the light source and viewing direction can\nbe easily determined, a method for determining the\nDoppler shift of the light frequency is needed. The PDV\ntechnique measures the shift in frequency directly using a\nfrequency-to-intensity converter. Essentially, a filter that\nattenuates the scattered signal based on the frequency of\nthat signal. For this filter to be efficient, it must have a cut-\noff that extends over the maximum expected range of\nvelocities. For this a basic example of the expected per-\nformance of the filter can be developed. If a laser at a\nwavelength of 532 nm is used as the light source and the\nminimum to maximum expected velocity range is \u00b1100 m\/\ns then the Doppler shift will be \u00b1200 MHz depending on o\nand i. In this example the filter will then need to have a\nmaximum cut-off for just over 400 MHz.\nFor such a narrow operation range Komine (1990)\nidentified the use of the atomic and molecular absorption\nbands. These absorption bands are spectroscopic lines and\nExperiments in Fluids 36 (2004) 3\u201310\nDOI 10.1007\/s00348-003-0586-0\n3\nReceived: 11 October 2002 \/ Accepted: 13 January 2003\nPublished online: 26 March 2003\n\u0001 Springer-Verlag 2003\nD.S.

Several substances\nhave been identified that have suitable properties that could\npotentially be utilised (Miles et al. 2001; Chan et al. 1995). Of\nthese substances, iodine has an absorption band in the\nnarrow tuning range of commercial argon-ion lasers and\nseveral absorption bands in the larger tuning range of fre-\nquency doubled Nd:YAG lasers (Miles et al. 2001).\nThe philosophy of the PDV technique is to tune a\nnarrow line-width laser light source to a point that is half\nway either up or down the side of an absorption (Meyers\nand Komine 1991). For no shift in the laser frequency, or\nzero velocity measured, the detector will see a signal of\n50% of the value of full transmission. Any Doppler shift in\nthe laser frequency will be measured as a change in the\nsignal intensity level. The sign of the velocity direction of\nthe measured component can also be determined from the\ndirection of the shift to either lower or higher intensities.\nEarly in the development of PDV it was realised that to\nobtain usable data a reference signal was needed (Komine\n1990). The reference signal splits off before the filter is\nused to normalise the signal measured through the filter,\ncorrecting for variations in the scattered intensity. There\nare two sources that vary the intensity of the scattered\nsignal. The power of the light source can vary in time as\nwell as the scattering efficiency of the scattering medium.\nFor measurement of flow velocities, a laser can be spread\ninto a light sheet. The power distribution in this sheet can\nvary spatially across the sheet and in time. The flow is\nseeded with particles that are designed to follow the flow\n(Meyers 1991). The amount of seeding and the size of the\nparticles affect the scattering efficiency and hence the in-\ntensity of the scattered signal. Hence, by normalising the\nsignal with a reference, the effect of intensity variation\ncaused by laser power fluctuations and seeding density can\nbe removed.\nOther than the work of Roehle and coworkers (Roehle\n1996; Roehle et al. 2000) all other PDV systems found by\nthe authors in the literature follow the general scheme of a\nsingle laser source and multiple viewing directions. Initial\nwork used CW lasers (Komine 1990; Ford and Tatam\n1997). However, many research groups quickly moved to\npulsed, frequency doubled Nd:YAG systems (Reinath 1997;\nElliot and Beutner 1999; Nobes et al. 2002) with the main\naim of increasing the available laser power while at the\nsame time making instantaneous velocity measurements\npossible. Meyers and Komine (1991) began the initial work\nin the area using a CW argon-ion laser and their technique\nis perhaps the classic arrangement of PDV. Here, six\ncameras in three pairs of signal and reference cameras\nviewed a region of interest from three different directions,\neach pair utilising its own iodine cell. This style of ar-\nrangement of the two cameras is shown in Fig. 2a. Some of\nthe reported difficulties with this system included the need\nto develop frame grabbers that could sample from two\ncameras at once (not commercially available at the time),\nintegration of a network of computers to control and drive\nthe equipment, low signal to noise from the interlaced\nframe cameras used, differential sensitivity of the different\niodine cells and the laser to vibration and temperature and\nthe extensive development of software for control of the\nexperiment as well as the processing of data.\nThe introduction of digital technology has seen the use\nof CCD cameras and commercial frame grabbers that\nsupport multiple cameras. Cooled CCD cameras can also\nFig. 1. The three-dimensional Doppler.

Two camera arrangments. a The arrangement of\nequipment used in a standard PDV head and b the arrangement\nused in a split view PDV system\n4\nprovide high signal to noise as well as higher data depths\nup to 16 bit (Meyers et al. 1998). These are expensive\nhowever, which has triggered the development of a num-\nber of novel arrangements to reduce the number of cam-\neras used. One alternative has focussed on using a single\ncamera to detect both the signal and reference images\n(Smith et al. 1996). A typical arrangement of the split view\ntechnique is shown Fig. 2b. Viewing from three directions,\nthis reduces the number of cameras from six to three at the\nexpense of lower spatial resolution. Another alternative is\nto use a duel frame camera and two consecutive laser\npulses of different frequency to capture a signal image with\nthe laser tuned onto the transfer function and reference\nimage with the laser shifted off the transfer function. In\nthis arrangement, three sets of a single camera and iodine\ncell would be required and this arrangement would guar-\nantee alignment between the signal and reference images.\nFor any of the layouts of the detector equipment, fre-\nquency drift of the laser is an important problem, espe-\ncially for pulsed Nd:YAG systems. For these lasers an\ninjection-seeded laser is used to tune the host laser. The\nseed laser has a narrow line width (~5 kHz) CW laser at\nthe fundamental frequency of the host laser (1064 nm).\nThis seed laser, which is frequency tuneable by changing\nthe temperature of the cavity crystal, is introduced into the\ncavity of the host laser and because its power is orders of\nmagnitude larger than the noise in the system, the host\nlaser builds up preferentially around this frequency. To\nlock the host laser to the seed laser the length of the cavity\nof the host laser is adjusted. This is done in a feedback\nmanner with the position of one of the mirrors of the host\nbeing dithered. This results in an output that can be tuned\nover the gain curve of the host laser by tuning the seed\nlaser and dithers about the frequency of the seed laser. The\namount of dither is dependent on the set-up of the whole\nlaser system but can be of the order of \u00b150 MHz. To\ncounter this movement of the frequency of the host laser\nmany research groups have employed a system to measure\nthe frequency of the laser for the pulse that is used to take\nthe measurement. A typical system is an arrangement of\nsingle point detectors and a dedicated iodine cell (Mose-\ndale et al. 2000; Elliot and Beutner 1999).\n3\nExperimental set-up\nThe PDV system described here has been designed to\naddress several of the problems and limitations of PDV\nsystems that have been reported in the literature. Overall,\nthe following criteria have focused the structure of the\ncurrent PDV system. The PDV system will aim to (1)\nmeasure the three components of velocity over a plane, (2)\nbe capable of both instantaneous as well as time-average\nmeasurements, (3) measure internal as well as external\nflows, (4) minimise the number of cameras used, (5) ad-\ndress problems of laser stability and (6) address problems\nof stability of the iodine cell.\nTo achieve these aims a PDV system has been devel-\noped that uses the philosophy of one illumination direc-\ntion and three viewing detectors. A schematic of the\nexperimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 3. To achieve\nthe aim of instantaneous measurement of velocity a pulsed\nfrequency doubled Nd:YAG laser is used (Spectra Physics\nGCR 190-30). This laser is capable of producing 10 ns\npulses with 300 mJ at 532 nm. A second CW laser\n(Lightwave Model 101) is coupled to and seeds the host\nlaser at the host laser fundamental frequency of 1064 nm.\nThe fundamental output from the host laser is frequency\ndoubled to 532 nm using a second harmonic generator\nand this is used as the light source for the experiment. The\nlaser pulse is spread into a light sheet using a combination\nof spherical and cylindrical lenses.\nA unique feature of this PDV system is that a single\nhead is utilised consisting of two cooled CCD cameras\n(LaVision Imager3) and a single iodine cell. The cameras\noperate at 15\u0002C giving low noise performance. The arrays\nare 1,280\u00b71,024 made up of square 6.7 lm pixels and\nimages collected are digitised to 12 bit. A single iodine\ncell is enclosed in a heated oven with the operation\nFig. 3. Experimental set-up.

A PID controller controls the temperature\nof the oven \u00b11 \u0002C. This form of iodine cell is termed a\nstarved cell. A schematic of the detector head is shown as a\nsub-figure in Fig. 4. Note this has the same basic layout of\ncameras and iodine cell as the single component head\nshown in Fig. 2a. The image transfer optics port an image\ninto the head system that is first split into two paths with a\n50\/50 non-polarising beam splitter. One path is directed to\nthe reference camera via a turning mirror, this corrects the\norientation of the image, while the second is directed\nthrough the iodine cell to the signal camera.\nThe image coupled into the detector head is delivered\nto it by an imaging fibre bundle. This is a coherent array of\nfibres that is split into four channels and each channel is\nmade up of 500\u00b7600 fibres and is each 4 m long. Three of\nthese are used to view the same region of interest from\nthree different directions. The fourth, as shown in Fig. 3,\nimages a small percentage of the laser pulse that has\npassed through a 532 nm dichroic mirror and scattered off\na screen. This provides a means of monitoring the fre-\nquency of each laser pulse. To demonstrate the combining\nof channels an example image from the signal camera of\nthe combined three views and the laser beam reference\nview is shown in Fig. 4. The top left and bottom right and\nleft are the three views of a reference target of crosses and\nviews an area 200\u00b7200 mm. The perspective distortion of\nthe target highlights the different directions of the three\nviews. The top right corner of the image in Fig. 4 is the\nfourth channel used to image the laser beam and does not\nview the reference target.\nThe use of the imaging fibre bundle reduces the total\nnumber of cameras used to two. The inclusion of the\nreferencing channel allows the system to use only a single\niodine cell and hence only a single calibration of the cell is\nrequired. Imaging the pulse for frequency referencing also\nallows the distribution of laser power in the pulse to be\nrecorded as well as the frequency distribution across the\nbeam wave front. This PDV system significantly reduces\nthe number of components and the complexity compared\nto systems reported in the literature.\n4\nProcessing procedure\nCamera control, image capture and processing for the PDV\nsystem have been integrated into a single software bundle\nthat is based on the camera\u2019s control macro language\n(LaVision DaVis 6.0). The macro language allows for the\ncapture, processing and display of data as well as a facility\nto port data to C\/C++ DLL functions for specific and fast\nprocessing. Several functions included in the software are\nincorporated into the processing of the PDV data.\nThe use of the imaging fibre bundle to capture all three\nviews onto a single image has introduced extra processing\nof the collected images compared to a system that has\nthree completely separate heads for each view. As part of\nthe collection process, the two raw images from the signal\nand reference cameras have had a background subtracted.\nThis background is the noise accumulated in the exposure\nas well as the read out noise. Before proceeding with\nprocessing the data to velocity vectors, each separate view\nis extracted from the raw images into separate buffers.\nThese buffers are then de-warped and the data interpo-\nlated and mapped onto a regular grid. The de-warping\ncoefficients are first defined using a target image of crosses\nas shown in Fig. 4. The software searches through the\nimages separately locating the centre of the crosses using a\ncorrelation method. In determining the de-warping coef-\nficients, the location of the crosses is first mapped to a\nnormalised space of 1 to 1 across the image and bottom to\ntop of the image. The de-warping coefficients are then\ndetermined from curve fitting a third order polynomial.\nThe data is then mapped onto a defined grid space with a\ncalculated scale. The coefficients are stored for this specific\nview. Of the six views extracted from the signal and ref-\nerence images, three from the signal and three from the\nreference image, a master view is selected and initially de-\nwarped. All other views are first mapped to the normalised\nspace and then mapped onto this master so that each view\nhas the same origin within the image and each pixel has\nthe same scale.\nDe-warping of the views corrects the images for dis-\ntortion. There are several distortions that are present.\nThere is a general perspective distortion in each view,\nwhich is a function of the viewing direction. The imaging\nsystem can introduce barrelling or pincushion distortion.\nWhile these distortions are relevant for both cameras,\nthere is a third distortion that is also present between the\ncameras. This is due to misalignment of the cameras and\nfor any change in the magnification of the image after the\nbeam splitter onto the image array of the cameras. Hence\nsix separate sets of de-warping coefficients are used.\nOnce the data has been de-warped, interpolated and\nmapped it can be passed into a processing procedure to\ndetermine velocities. Before division of the signal and\nreference images, the data is corrected using a \u2018white card\u2019\ncorrection and put through a low pass filter. The white\ncard correction corrects the data for variations of signal\nsensitivity in the CCD and vignetting of the signal across\nFig. 4. Image of the target. An example image of the view through\nthe image bundle of a reference target captured with only one\ncamera. The area viewed of the target is 200\u00b7200 mm\n6\nthe array. A low pass filter can be used to reduce the effects\nof laser speckle. After the division of each of the three\nviews the intensity ratio is converted to frequency. This\nconversion is via a polynomial fit of the iodine transfer\nfunction. The transfer function of the absorption band\nused is measured by frequency tuning the laser across the\nrange of the absorption band. This data is then fitted to a\nmodel of the absorption spectra using the code developed\nby Forkey (1996). After the conversion, the data at each\npoint in the view is an absolute measurement of the\nscattered laser frequency. A measurement of laser fre-\nquency for the measurement pulse is determined using the\nsame fitting procedure using the image of the laser pulse\ncaptured by the fourth leg of the fibre-imaging bundle. The\nDoppler difference is then calculated using Eq. (1) and the\nvelocity magnitude of the component defined by the laser\nand viewing direction can be calculated. This procedure is\nrepeated for each of the three views. The data can then be\nmapped onto a regular orthogonal grid generating the\nthree orthogonal components of the measured velocity\nover a plane in the reference frame of the experiment.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nThe velocity field of a rotating disk\nThe system has been developed with a specific aim to\nmeasure velocities of a flow using particles seeded into the\nflow as the scattering medium. Any moving object how-\never will Doppler shift a light source directed at it. In the\ndevelopment stage of the system a rotating disk has been\nused to provide a moving field of a well-defined velocity.\nResults of the system are presented here using a rotating\ndisk 200 mm in diameter that has been coated with flat\nwhite paint with the aim to give near uniform reflection.\nThe disk is illuminated by the laser at an angle that is near\nperpendicular to the rotational axis. The three views are\narranged so that all three are sensitive to the rotating field.\nInstantaneous results of the velocity field were collected\nusing the pulsed Nd:YAG described earlier as the light\nsource.\nThe computed velocity field for the three different views\nof the disk are shown in Fig. 5. The results have been\nsmoothed with several passes of a low pass filter to reduce\nthe effect of speckle noise. The residual effects of laser\nspeckle are however still evident in the image as well as the\nnoticeable fluctuations over larger areas. This can be\nlinked to changes in the distributions of the laser power\nacross the wave front. A significant proportion of this ef-\nfect is removed using the white card correction for laser\npower distribution however there is a small amount of AC\nfluctuation still present.\nThe vector map of the velocity field shown in Fig. 6 has\nbeen generated by mapping the scalar field of the three\nviews in each data set onto a regular orthogonal grid. The\ntransformation matrix is generated using the velocity\nmaps and information of the view directions. In the vector\nmap, only every tenth vector has been shown. Noise\npresent in the instantaneous measurement results in a\nvector field that has some bad vector directions. However,\ngenerally the velocity field is representative of the velocity\nfield that can be expected of the rotating disk.\n5.2\nThe instantaneous velocity field of a jet\nThe PDV has also been used to measure the instantaneous\nvelocity field of a jet flow that has been seeded uniformly\nwith particles. The jet exits a 70-mm diameter pipe nozzle\nthat had a bulk exit velocity of 30 m\/s. Particles of a mean\ndiameter of 0.6 lm were introduced into the jet flow well\nup stream from the nozzle exit. A raw image from the\nreference camera of the flow is shown in Fig. 7. This figure\nshows the three views of the jet and a single view of the\nFig. 5. Computed velocities from each view for the YAG. The\ncomputed instantaneous velocity field for the different views\nusing a pulsed frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser\n7\nintensity of the laser pulse in the top right hand corner of\nthe image. Poor alignment of optics within the laser is the\nmost likely reason for variations in this intensity image of\nthe laser pulse. This raw image shows the effect of laser\nspeckle on the scattered signal. As described earlier, the\nspeckle pattern is removed using a low pass filter. This\nimage also shows that for this measurement the PDV\nsystem was set-up in a different configuration. The views\non the left of the image have been taken from the same\nside of the laser light sheet. The three third view (bottom\nright) is a mirror reflection of the bottom left view. This\ncan be seen in the shape and positions of structures in the\nseeded jet. The full width of the jet has been imaged and\nregions where the non-seeded ambient fluid is present are\nevident by the lack of signal. For the calculation of velocity\nvectors, only the region marked by the rectangle has been\nused because no results will be computed where there is no\nsignal. Also in this region the scattered signal to the ref-\nerence camera is near uniform.\nThe computed and mapped orthogonal field for the\nmarked region of Fig. 7 is shown in Fig. 8a. Vectors\nindicate the direction and magnitude of the in-plane\ncomponents of velocity while the colour map indicates\nthe magnitude of the out-of-plane component. Only\none in eight velocity vectors are shown. This velocity\nfield is typical of what can be expected in the near field\nof the jet. The region marked in Fig. 8a shows the\npresence of reverse flow. This region is magnified in\nFig. 8b where all computed velocity vectors have been\nshown. The vector map clearly shows the presence of a\nvortex whose axis at the time of capture is pointing out-\nof-plane. This instantaneous vector field is smooth and\nhas a general bulk velocity similar to the bulk flow\nvelocity of the jet.\n5.3\nErrors\nThere are several areas within which errors to the calcu-\nlation of a velocity vector using the PDV technique can be\nassociated. The experiments investigating the velocity field\nof the rotating disk have highlighted the following sources\nof errors as potentially the most significant in the current\ntechnique.\nImage registration\u2014this is the accuracy of the regis-\ntration between the signal and reference images. Accurate\nregistration of the two images in principle would remove\nFig. 7. Raw image view of the jet\n(square showing region of\ninterest).

The processed\nvelocity vector fields of the rotating disk\n8\nthe noise introduced by laser speckle. However, if there is\nsome error in the registration, an error would be intro-\nduced after the division that would appear similar to\nspeckle noise.\nModelling of the iodine transfer function\u2014the shape of\nthe transfer function is critically dependent on the vapour\npressure of Iodine in the cell and hence the operating\ntemperature of the oven. As highlighted by other authors,\nthe use of a starved cell will minimise these effects. Ac-\ncurate modelling of the shape of the transfer function is\nhowever needed and assumptions of linearity or Gaussian\nshape of the function over the region of the measurement\ncan led to significant errors.\nMeasurement of laser frequency\u2014the pulsed laser has a\nsignificant pulse to pulse frequency fluctuation that re-\nquires individual measurement of each measurement pulse\nfrequency to correct each data point.\nImage registration between views\u2014each view shown in\nFigs. 7 and 8 has been mapped onto a single scale for that\ndata set. The accuracy of how well these individual views\nregister with each other will affect the result of the matrix\nmapping to the orthogonal representation of the data.\n6\nConclusions\nA PDV technique has been described that is capable of\nmeasuring the three instantaneous components of velocity\nover a two-dimensional region. All three views needed to\ndefine a three-dimensional velocity field have been re-\ncorded using a single pair of signal and reference cameras\nby porting the three views through a fibre-imaging bundle.\nThe legs of this bundle combine into a single array that is\nimaged through the PDV detection head. Laser frequency\nstability is monitored and measured using the fourth leg\nof the bundle allowing for correction for any frequency\nmovement of the laser for each instantaneous measure-\nment. The use of a single PDV detector head minimises\nthe number of CCD array cameras that are used to a total\nof two and only a single iodine cell is used for both\nmeasurement of the three velocity components and ref-\nerence measurement of the laser frequency. Only a single\nfrequency scan is needed to define the transfer function of\nthe iodine cell for converting measured intensities to\nfrequency. Any drift in the iodine cell characteristics is\nthen constant across all measured components. The\ninnovations of the current set-up of PDV will allow\nfor simple integration of the technique into experimental\nrigs.\nReferences\nChan VSS, Heyes AL, Robinson DI, Turner JT (1995) Iodine\nabsorption filters for Doppler global velocimetry.
