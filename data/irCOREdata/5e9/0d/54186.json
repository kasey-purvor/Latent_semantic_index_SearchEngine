The position of the British Isles in the context of the stable isotope systematics of NW\nEurope is reviewed briefly.\nKeywords: Stable isotopes, surface waters, groundwater, British Isles\n\u0017\u0012\t\u0014\u000e\u001c\u001b\u0010\t\r\u000e\u0012\nAway from coastal influences, surface waters and\ngroundwaters are derived exclusively from precipitation.\nPart 1 of this study (Darling and Talbot, 2003) focused on\nthe isotopic composition of rainfall in Great Britain and\nIreland. The present paper considers mainly the recharge\nprocess and the pattern of groundwater isotope values\nresulting from the climate of the British Isles. In addition,\nthe isotopic variability of surface waters is considered\nbriefly, though fewer data are available.\nOxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios (18O\/16O and\n2H\/1H ratios of the water molecule) are by their nature\nexcellent tracers of the physical processes affecting water.\nA knowledge of \u2018baseline\u2019 isotopic compositions in the\nwaters of a region creates a starting point for isotope-based\napplications ranging from the local, e.g. fingerprinting\nsources of water leakage (Butler and Verhagen, 1997;\nMar\u00e9chal and Etcheverry, 2003), to the regional, e.g.\ngroundwater resource and quality studies (Smith et al., 1976;\nRauert et al., 1993), the archaeological (Iacumin et al., 1997;\nWhite et al., 1998), the environmental (Andrews et al., 1997;\nIacumin and Longinelli, 2002), the quasi-forensic\n(Keenlyside et al., 1997) and ultimately as part of the global\nmosaic which aids the understanding of climatic processes\nW.G. Darling, A.H. Bath and J.C. Talbot\n184\n(Rozanski et al., 1993; Hoffmann et al., 2000). In contrast\nto some areas of Europe, such as Germany and Italy (F\u00f6rstel\nand H\u00fctzen, 1983; Longinelli and Selmo, 2003), the stable\nisotopic variations of waters in the British Isles have hitherto\nnot been summarised in any systematic way. However, the\ncompilation of isotopic datasets by the British Geological\nSurvey (BGS) over the past 25 years combined with\n(relatively scarce) published studies by other researchers\nmakes it possible for the present paper to attempt a synthesis.\nAlthough there are rather few data for Ireland in comparison\nto Great Britain, enough have been obtained to permit a\nstudy of the British Isles as a whole.\n\u001a\n\u0011\u000f\f\r\u0012\u001d\u0004\n\u0012\u001c\u0004\n\u0012\n\f\u001f\b\r\b\nUnfiltered water samples were collected and stored in glass\nbottles with rubber-lined metal caps, usually of 7 ml or 28\nml capacity to provide adequate volume for the separate\nanalysis of 18O\/16O and 2H\/1H. Analysis was carried out using\nstandard preparation techniques followed by isotope ratio\nmeasurement on VG-Micromass 602E or Optima mass\nspectrometers. All data considered in this paper are\nexpressed in \u2030 with respect to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean\nWater (VSMOW) on the delta scale:\n\u03b4 = [(R\nsample\/Rstandard)-1] x 103 (1)\nwhere R\nsample is the 18O\/16O or 2H\/1H ratio of the sample, and\nR\nstandard the corresponding ratio in VSMOW.

Runoff is likely to suffer less \u2018damping\u2019\nof rainfall isotopic variability than aquifer discharge, though\nthe effects are still fairly pronounced (e.g. Ogunkoya and\nJenkins, 1991). Once these waters are exposed to the\natmosphere in waterways or lakes, they are potentially\nsubject to modification by evaporative fractionation (e.g.\nClark and Fritz, 1997). The kinetic processes involved tend\nto cause isotopic ratios to deviate in a correlated way from\nvalues approximately consistent with the World Meteoric\nLine (WML) of Craig (1961), which has a \u03b42H versus \u03b418O\nslope of 8, to values that define a lower slope. Slope values\ndepend critically on atmospheric humidity, with the lowest\nslopes produced by lowest humidity. The amount of\nevaporation on the other hand is indicated by the\ndisplacement of the sample along the evaporative line, which\nin extreme cases can result in positive \u03b4-values (e.g. Clark\nand Fritz, 1997). Clearly, lakes are more likely than rivers\nto suffer evaporative modification since residence times will\nnormally be longer, thus allowing time for more contact\nand exchange with the atmosphere.\nBecause the isotopic values of surface waters may change\nover time owing to evaporation, their measurement is often\nseen as being of limited use in practical terms. In general\nthey are measured only for specific purposes such as\ncharacterising local sources of leakage (e.g. from dams) or\nfor identifying larger-scale hydraulic links between surface\nwaters and groundwater. As the climate of NW Europe is\nseldom sufficiently warm and dry to impart large evaporative\nisotope shifts to surface waters, such applications are\nconstrained in the region. Accordingly, little has been\npublished on the stable isotopic composition of surface\nwaters in the British Isles.\nThe compositional range of surface waters is always liable\nto exceed that of groundwaters in a particular area, partly\nbecause of the evaporative effects outlined above, but also\nbecause those surface waters resulting more or less directly\nfrom rainfall can, under certain conditions, reflect the\nextremes of individual rainfall events. In Britain, the most\nenriched sample found during this survey had a \u03b418O value\nof \u20131.3\u2030, while the most depleted value reported is \u201310.6\u2030\n(Soulsby et al., 1999). This range of ~9\u2030 is about double\nthat measured for groundwaters (see below).\nThe available data from samplings of surface waters in\nthe British Isles are shown in Fig. 1 in the form of a delta-\nplot (\u03b42H v. \u03b418O), where lakes and canals are included under\nthe \u2018standing\u2019 and rivers under the \u2018flowing\u2019 categories.\n(Isotope ratios in upland streams are not considered here;\ntheir use in hydrograph separations is beyond the scope of\nthis paper.)  It is apparent that, taken as a whole, surface\nwaters lie along a lower slope than the WML, exhibiting\nthe signs of evaporative enrichment in heavy isotopes under\na generally high-humidity climate. The correlation is not\nparticularly good but the samples come from a wide area of\nthe British Isles at different dates and are likely to have had\ndifferent original compositions along the WML or its local\nvariants. Predictably, standing (more accurately slow-\nmoving) waters show more evidence of evaporation than\nrivers. The most enriched compositions were found in waters\nfrom small lochs on the Scottish islands, the \u2018heaviest\u2019\nsample of all (Loch of Watlee, Unst, Shetlands)\ncoincidentally being the most northerly sample of the present\nsurvey. The major factor in these enrichments may be that\nThe O & H stable isotopic composition of fresh waters in the British Isles. 2. Surface waters and groundwater\n185\nhigh average wind velocities in the Scottish islands lead to\nrelatively large evaporation\/inflow ratios in the smaller\nbasins.\nRiver variations\nMost rivers have two main sources of water: runoff and\nbaseflow. At any one time, the balance between these\ndepends partly on the geology of the catchment and partly\non the season of the year. Thus, for example, rivers at the\nend of a typical British summer contain a low flow\n(baseflow) which primarily represents the discharge from\nthe aquifer(s) over which the river passes. In an attempt to\ndiscover to what extent river waters may vary in isotopic\ncomposition over the course of a year, monthly samples were\ncollected from the River Thames at Wallingford from\nDecember 1997 to December 1998. The results are shown\nin Figs. 2 and 3.\nSeveral points about these data should be noted: (i) the\nriver isotope values are spot samples taken during the month\nconcerned and do not represent mean or weighted mean\nvalues; (ii) the flowrates are based on measurements taken\nat a weir a few km up-river from the collection point; (iii)\nthe rainfall data refer to the Wallingford collection station\n(Darling and Talbot, 2003) but are assumed to be reasonably\nindicative of conditions further up the catchment.\nFigure 2 shows that there was little variation in the isotopic\ncomposition of the river water over much of the year. Only\nin late summer and early autumn was there much change.\nAfter two months of low flow at the end of August there\nwas some isotopic enrichment, which judging by the\ndisplacement from the WML (Fig. 3) may have been due to\nWM\nL\n-60\n-55\n-50\n-45\n-40\n-35\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1\n\u03b418O \u2030\n\u03b42\nH\n \u2030\nStanding Flowing\nFig. 1. \u03b4-plot for surface waters from the British Isles (BGS\nunpublished data).  The datapoints are arrayed along a lower slope\nthan that of the World Meteoric Line (WML) of Craig (1961),\nindicating the effects of evaporative fractionation.  Standing waters\nexhibit these effects more strongly because they have more time to\nevaporate.\nDecNovOctSepAugJulJunMayAprMarFebJanDec\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nm\n3 s\n-\n1  \no\nr \nm\nm\nMean river flow\nTotal rainfall\nDec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n\u03b41\n8 O\n \u2030\nRiver Rainfall\nRi\nRa\nFig. 2.

The isotopic\ncomposition of October and November\u2019s rainfall as\nmeasured at Wallingford was relatively depleted, and runoff\nfrom these events seems likely to have contributed to the\nriver\u2019s composition. However, isotopically depleted rainfall\nand high river flow the previous January had no marked\neffect on river composition. At the beginning of autumn\nthere may be insufficient soil moisture left after summer\nevapotranspiration to buffer the isotopic signature of water\nfrom the first few rainfall events of the \u2018winter\u2019 period as it\nmoves via infiltration to feeding the river, while later on\nthere is enough mixing to result in a near-average river\ncomposition.\nTwo lesser rivers, the Darent and Stour, were studied more\nrecently, again over approximately one year. The Darent\nwas sampled a few km above Dartford, Kent, while the Stour\nwas sampled in its upper course near Haverhill, Suffolk.\nBoth can be regarded as Chalk rivers in their respective\nsampling areas and therefore have important baseflow\ncomponents, though the Stour flows through a catchment\ndominated by boulder clay drift. Plots of \u03b418O v. time are\nshown in Fig. 4. These show an offset in isotopic\ncomposition for much of the year with apparently unrelated\nfluctuations in values, and a convergence over the course\nof the winter of 2002\u201303. These features are provisionally\nattributed as follows: the isotopic offset is due partly to\ndifferent degrees of rainout affecting Kent and Suffolk, but\nrather more to the existence of extensive gravel workings\non the Darent upstream, particularly in the Sevenoaks area,\nwhich promote evaporative enrichment for much of the year.\nThe convergence is caused by the notably wet autumn\nflushing away any evaporated water from the Darent (the\n\u03b418O value for November rainfall at Wallingford, the largest\nmonthly total for 25 years, is shown in Fig. 4). Other\nvariations are the consequence of the balance between\nbaseflow and runoff: even though both rivers are likely to\nbe subject to basically similar rainfall isotope inputs, the\ndrift cover in the Stour valley is likely to promote a different\nresponse to rainfall from that of the largely uncovered Chalk\nof the lower Darent.\nThe variations observed in the Darent and Stour tend\ntowards the very small range of compositions noted by\nLawler (1987) during investigations of the rivers Lambourn\nand Winterbourne in Berkshire.

In general,\ngroundwaters are well-mixed and would therefore be\nexpected to give rise to uniform stream compositions, except\nin markedly karstic units such as the Carboniferous\nLimestone (Lawler ibid).\n\u000b\u0003\f\u0002\r\u000e\t\u0005\n\u0007\u0003\nThe relationship between rainfall and groundwater\nEven in the more humid-temperate areas of the world, only\na relatively small proportion of total rainfall will ever reach\nthe underlying aquifer. The remainder will, apart from any\ndirect runoff, be lost to evaporation or transpiration; since\nthese reach their peak in summer, it is reasonable to assume\nthat most recharge occurs in the winter. Indeed, Darling and\nBath (1988) noted that drainage at the base of a 5 m deep\nChalk lysimeter at Fleam Dyke in eastern England occurred\nonly from around November to May.\nPart 1 of this study (Darling and Talbot, 2003) shows that\nin Britain there is a tendency for winter rainfall to be more\nisotopically depleted than summer rainfall; this is a normal\npattern for many regions of the world (Clark and Fritz,\n1997). It might therefore be expected that the bulk isotopic\ncomposition of winter half-year rainfall (September\u2013\nFebruary) would be close to that of groundwater. Table 1\ngives typical local groundwater isotopic compositions\ncompared with the bulk compositions of winter, summer\nand annual rainfall collected at three main stations:\nWallingford (Oxfordshire), Keyworth (Nottinghamshire)\nand Valentia (Co Kerry).\nTable 1 shows that water pumped from the Chalk in the\nvicinity of Wallingford has a \u03b418O composition very close\nto the weighted mean of rainfall, implying that winter and\nsummer rainfall alike are contributing to recharge.\nGroundwaters from the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone\naquifer in the vicinity of the Keyworth station show a bias\nin favour of winter rainfall. Since the climate of Keyworth\nis little different from that of Wallingford, especially in terms\nof rainfall amount, the bias seems likely to be attributable\nto differences in the physical properties between chalk\n(coccolith limestone) and sandstone. The sandstones\nforming major UK aquifers (Sherwood Sandstone and\nLower Greensand) tend to have freely-draining unsaturated\nzones, in which infiltrating rainfall, if not intercepted for\nplant transpiration, will flow downwards as recharge to the\naquifer. This would favour recharge of winter rainfall. In\ncontrast, owing to an extremely fine texture, chalk\nporespaces are commonly close to saturation throughout the\nunsaturated zone (Barker and Foster, 1981). This means that\ninfiltrating rainfall is likely to be buffered by mixing with\nexisting porewater. Only a proportion of the mixed water\nwill be transpired, the remainder eventually becoming\nrecharge with a composition at or near the weighted mean.\nIn apparent contrast to the case of the Sherwood\nSandstone, Table 1 suggests that spring waters in the Valentia\nregion are the result of rather greater recharge in summer,\nTable 1.

Talbot\n188\nbut this seems unlikely since winter rainfall accounts for\nsome 60% of annual rainfall in the region. The springs were\nsampled in June 1993; the low storage of the peaty deposits\ntypical of the area favours relatively short residence times\nand therefore the spring compositions may have reflected a\nsubstantial contribution from the previous winter\u2019s rainfall\nwhich was atypically enriched (GNIP, 2002).\nAlthough sparse, the available time-sequence data for\ngroundwaters points to considerable homogeneity in isotopic\ncomposition below the level of circulation in superficial\ndeposits. On a seasonal scale neither the shallow test\nboreholes at Altnabreac, Scotland (Kay et al., 1984) nor a\nborehole at Malham, North Yorkshire (Lawler, 1987)\nshowed any convincing evidence of variation (Fig. 5a, 5b),\ndespite both the formations concerned (granite and\nCarboniferous Limestone respectively) being dominated by\nrelatively rapidly-responding fracture permeability. Figures\n5b and 5c also demonstrate that groundwaters pumped from\nthe Chalk of southern England show little variation either\non the seasonal or longer-term timescales, but this may\nreflect the buffering effects of chalk\u2019s high porosity. In\naquifers where intergranular permeability predominates,\nsuch as the Sherwood Sandstone, waters would be expected\nto be well-mixed resulting in a similar degree of isotopic\nhomogeneity.\nTaken as a whole, the evidence suggests that the stable\nisotopic composition of groundwaters over the British Isles\nis close (i.e. within 0.5\u2030 \u03b418O) to the bulk composition of\nrainfall. This is presumably the result of mixing between\nnew rainfall and older soil water, which must occur so\nrapidly that evapotranspiration does not use exclusively new\nwater; transpiration would in any case be derived from a\nrange of rooting depths. (An alternative view is that spring\nand summer rainfall is wholly, or almost wholly, used up by\nevapotranspiration, and that recharge consists effectively\nof a mixture of \u2018heavy\u2019 autumn and \u2018light\u2019 winter rainfall\nthat happens to approximate the annual average.

Surface waters and groundwater\n189\nTalbot (2003) shows that all combinations of months\nbetween September and May give weighted averages more\ndepleted than local groundwaters.)  The evidence further\nimplies that groundwaters preserve a good record of rainfall\nintegrated over the last tens of years or more. Accordingly,\ngroundwater and bulked rainfall isotope values are to a great\nextent interchangeable, in that one can be reasonably well\npredicted from the other.\nGroundwater isotope maps\nTwo contour maps showing the compositions of \u03b418O and\n\u03b42H respectively for \u2018recent\u2019 groundwaters in the British\nIsles are presented in Fig. 6. The maps are based primarily\non BGS studies, but also use data from Hiscock et al. (1996)\nand Kimblin (1995). All the points chosen are in unconfined\naquifers and are known or believed to represent\ngroundwaters recharged well within the Holocene (0\u201310 ka\nBP), and therefore unlikely to contain any groundwater from\nGlacial times (\u2018palaeowater\u2019). Additionally, all the waters\nare considered to have suffered little or no modification by\nprocesses such as evaporation which might otherwise have\naffected isotopic compositions.\nThe inset to Fig. 6 shows that the density of the\ngroundwater sampling on which the maps are based is\nvariable, with lowest densities in Scotland, Wales and\nIreland largely because these countries depend more on\nsurface waters to meet their needs. The contouring on the\nmaps is therefore more speculative in these areas. No account\nof sampling altitude has been taken because correcting to\nsea level values is not a viable option. Over much of the\nBritish Isles this is unlikely to be a significant issue, but in\nareas of high relief the isotopic contouring is more of a\ncompromise and it is in these areas that some groundwaters\nare likely to have isotopic compositions outside the contour\ninterval, most probably on the depleted side.\nAs would be expected, both maps show essentially similar\nfeatures. The spread of isotopic compositions is relatively\nlarge, covering ranges of almost 4\u2030 in \u03b418O and 30\u2030 in\n\u03b42H. Despite the complexity of their weather patterns, the\nBritish Isles receive most of their rainfall from the southwest,\nand this basically controls the areal isotopic distribution.\nFig. 6.

Darling, A.H. Bath and J.C. Talbot\n190\nHowever, the topography of the islands exerts some\ninfluence, particularly the Pennines of England and the\nHighlands of Scotland where sizeable isotopic depletions\ntake place between the western and eastern sides of the\ncountry owing to the orographic patterns of rainfall\ndistribution. Conversely, in flat-lying areas such as the\nMidlands of Ireland and England there is relatively little\nchange. Proximity to the sea can have a profound effect:\nfor example, although the distance from Land\u2019s End to the\nnorthern Outer Hebrides is some 1000 km there is little\nisotopic change. Indeed, there are some indications from\nthe database that all peri-coastal areas, even on eastern\nleeward coastlines, have groundwaters rather more enriched\nthan those inland. However, the database is not yet\ncomprehensive enough to demonstrate such an \u2018edge effect\u2019\nconvincingly.\nAs might be expected, the pattern in variation of\ngroundwater stable isotope ratios resembles to an extent that\nof average rainfall amount (Fig. 7). Basically, the lower the\namount of rainfall the greater the depletion in the heavier\nisotopes 18O and 2H. However the equivalence is not\nunconditional because of altitude effects: for example, the\nlarge amounts of rainfall depicted for the Scottish Highlands\nwould be expected to have a relatively depleted weighted\naverage composition at higher elevations because of\ntemperature effects. Air temperature might also be expected\nto show some relationship; Fig. 8 shows that the similarity\nFig. 7.

Surface waters and groundwater\n191\nis much more marked for the January rather than the July\nmeans. This is slightly surprising given that it has been\nshown above that groundwater isotopic values are by no\nmeans controlled exclusively by winter half-year rainfall.\nClearly the three-way relationship between rainfall,\ntemperature and groundwater isotopic composition is\ncomplex.\nAltitude effects\nMost of the groundwaters measured were obtained from\nlowland areas where the effects of altitude on rainfall\ncompositions will have been either small or minimal.\nHowever, Darling and Talbot (2003) show that these effects\ncan be significant in areas of high relief. Accordingly in\nmountainous areas the contouring of Fig. 6 only represents\ngroundwater composition in broad terms, though this is\nperhaps of limited practical concern because in general such\nareas do not have significant groundwater reserves.\nThere are a few instances in Scotland where high-level\nspring data are available against which to test the altitude\neffect of approximately \u20130.25\u2030 \u03b418O per 100 m ascent\nwhich was observed for rainfall in the Monachyle catchment\nat Balquhidder (Darling and Talbot, 2003). A sample\ncollected for the present study from a spring at 850 m aod\n(above ordnance datum) on Sgurr Beag (NGR 19970\n81080), Northwest Highlands, had a \u03b418O composition of\n\u20137.1\u2030 compared to \u20135.7\u2030 for a groundwater seepage at\n150 m aod in nearby Barrisdale (NGR 18620 80450).\nAssuming the low discharge rate reflected an essentially\nlocally recharged water, an altitude effect of \u20130.20\u2030 per\n100 m is indicated, consistent with the Monachyle rainfall\ndata.\nIn the Grampian Highlands to the east, a spring in Dalvorar\nCorrie (NGR 30407 78856) near Braemar had a \u03b418O value\nof \u20139.4\u2030 for an altitude of 700 m aod, while a spring in the\nDrumtochty Forest at 300 m aod (NGR 30703 78154) had a\nvalue of \u20138.2\u2030. This equates to an altitude effect of \u20130.30\u2030\nper 100 m. While the magnitude of the altitude effect in\nboth localities is similar, the groundwaters in the Grampian\nHighlands are much more depleted owing to the distance\nfrom the Atlantic coast and consequent operation of rainout\neffects (Darling and Talbot, 2003).\nIn Part 1 of this study (Darling and Talbot, 2003) it was\nexplained that snow often has a highly depleted isotopic\ncomposition because the frozen water cannot re-equilibrate\nwith air at higher temperatures during its fall. The fact that\nthe higher mountains of Scotland in particular receive a\nsizeable part of their precipitation in the form of snow\nsuggests that some very negative groundwater values should\nbe found due to the infiltration of snowmelt. However, as\nthe Sgurr Beag and Dalvorar examples show, this does not\nseem to occur, presumably because most snowmelt leaves\nthe catchments as surface water. Even on the high massif of\nthe Cairngorm Mountains to the north of Braemar, where\nup to 40 percent of precipitation may fall as snow, the most\ndepleted composition sampled from a spring at 970 m was\n\u20139.7\u2030 (Soulsby et al., 1999), which conforms reasonably\nwell with the Braemar altitude effect quantified above. This\nsuggests the most depleted, reasonably well-mixed\ngroundwater that could be expected in the British Isles under\ntoday\u2019s climatic conditions would have a \u03b418O no more\nnegative than about \u201310\u2030.\nSecular changes\nWhile the groundwater maps shown in Fig. 6 reflect bulk\nrainfall isotope values integrated over periods probably\naveraging tens to hundreds of years, in the longer term there\nhave been changes in bulk rainfall composition across the\nBritish Isles. Radiocarbon dating of residence times of older\nwaters in the confined zones of the principal aquifers\nindicates that waters from the late Pleistocene (i.e. ages of\n10 ka and upwards) are of the order of 1.5\u2030 more depleted\nin \u03b418O (and concomitantly in \u03b42H) compared to present-\nday compositions (e.g. Darling et al., 1997). These\ndifferences are related primarily to the lowering of recharge\ntemperature (RT) under peri-glacial climatic conditions. The\n\u03b418O seasonal temperature effect of 0.23\u2030 per \u00b0C noted for\nrainfall at Keyworth (Darling and Talbot, 2003) can be\ncompared with noble gas RT and isotopic data from the local\nTriassic sandstone aquifer which yield a depletion of\napproximately 1.5\u2030 in \u03b418O for a temperature drop of\n5\u20136\u00b0C (Bath et al., 1979). However, because ocean waters\nwould have been up to 1\u2030 more enriched in \u03b418O during\nglacial periods (Schrag et al., 1996), the real isotopic\ndepletion in the palaeowaters is closer to 2.5\u2030. This would\namount to a secular temperature effect of around 0.45\u2030\nper \u00b0C. This difference indicates that while the seasonal\ntemperature effect to a degree mimics climate change insofar\nas it goes through summer and winter extremes (Siegenthaler\nand Matter, 1983), there are additional factors affecting the\nlong-term \u03b418O\/RT relationship. These might include\nchanges in temperature difference between source and\nrecharge areas, changes in sea level and therefore land area,\nand changes in seasonality of recharge.\nThe maps in Fig. 9 attempt to show the isotopic\ncomposition of what would have been late-Quaternary\nunconfined groundwaters immediately prior to the\nPleistocene-Holocene transition at some 10 ka BP.\nInformation is most plentiful for the main aquifers of\nEngland but elsewhere the reconstruction is more\nW.G. Darling, A.H. Bath and J.C. Talbot\n192\nspeculative. At least in southern Britain, the present pattern\nof geographical differentials in isotopic composition appears\nto have been largely retained from the Quaternary, indicating\nthat air-mass trajectories have remained substantially similar\nsince at least the late Pleistocene. (This supports the view\nof Rozanski (1985) that European atmospheric circulation\nhas been unchanged for at least 35 ka.)  Beyond the\nQuaternary, the little evidence available from the British\nIsles is much more difficult to interpret (Darling et al., 1997).\n\u0001\f\u0002\u0003\u0006\u0007\u0001\b\f\u0004\b\t\u0005\n\u0007\u0003\b\u0001\u0002\u000f\u000f\u0010\u0011\nWhere water is supplied from unconfined aquifers in the\nvicinity, the stable isotopic composition of piped water\n(\u2018tapwater\u2019) will be representative of local groundwater\nbecause there is no significant opportunity for fractionation\nto occur.

They show that for many lowland\nareas agreement between tapwater values and shallow\ngroundwater \u03b418O contours is reasonably good. Larger\ndifferences occur in areas where supplies are likely to be\nobtained from mountain lakes, or where open reservoirs are\nan important element in meeting water demands. In the\nformer case tapwater would be more depleted, and in the\nlatter case more enriched, than would be anticipated on the\nbasis of the groundwater contouring. Fig. 10 shows some\nexamples of depletion in the Scottish Highlands, and both\nenrichment and depletion in SW England where water\nsupplies may be derived from reservoirs of different sizes\nand elevations. It also shows that Central London tapwater\nhas a composition isotopically heavier than would be\nexpected from local shallow groundwater.

The\nresults from the Faeroes (Fig. 12) are notable for the amount\nof isotopic depletion between the south (Su\u00f0uroy) and the\nnorth (Kunoy and Bor\u00f0oy), presumably due to rainout\neffects over the islands which reach altitudes in excess of\n800 m. The value used in Fig. 11 is the average for the two\nsites on Su\u00f0uroy, the most isolated island and with a\nrelatively low relief, where rainfall should be least modified\nby topographic interactions.\nOn the basis of the rainfall-groundwater relationship\nconsidered above, it is assumed that average groundwater\ncompositions are comparable with weighted mean rainfall\nfor a particular location.

Tapwater \u03b418O compositions superimposed on the recent\ngroundwater contour map from Fig 6.  Agreement is reasonably\ngood except for some northern and south-western localities (most\ntapwater data by courtesy of C Sonntag).\nFig. 11. The wider perspective for the northeast Atlantic: long-term\nweighted means of \u03b418O (above) and \u03b42H (below) for the rainfall\ncollection stations at Valentia, Wallingford, Gr\u00f6ningen and Lista\n(rectangles, data from GNIP, 2002), plus representative water\ncompositions from the Shetland and Faeroe Islands (ovals, data from\nthis study).  French contours for \u03b418O in rainfall from Chery et al.\n(2000) after Lecolle (1985).\nproximity to the ocean can have a profound effect on isotopic\ncompositions. Although the Faeroe Islands lie some 10\ndegrees in latitude to the north of Valentia Island, isotopic\ndepletion is small: there is, for example, significantly more\ndepletion between Land\u2019s End and Wallingford, only\n350 km apart (see Fig. 6). However, isotope values do not\nalways depend directly on proximity to the ocean;\npredominant wind and ocean current directions are also\nimportant. Thus waters found at Lista are isotopically\nheavier than those at Gr\u00f6ningen several hundred km to the\nsouth, because the latter experiences more of the \u2018continental\neffect\u2019. The rainfall \u03b418O contours from the Channel coastal\nzone of France match up only approximately with the\nEnglish groundwater contours of Fig. 6, but the French\ndatabase is at a preliminary stage (Chery et al., 2000).\n!\u000e\u0012\u0010\f\u001b\b\r\u000e\u0012\b\nSurface waters show evidence of evaporative fractionation\nbut, given the temperate nature of the climate of the British\nIsles, isotopic enrichments are generally small. Monthly\nsampling from the Upper Thames indicates that its isotopic\ncomposition is a complex balance between surface\nW.G. Darling, A.H. Bath and J.C. Talbot\n194\ncontributions and groundwater inflow, modified by soil\nconditions and evaporative effects. Periodic sampling from\nlesser Chalk rivers has so far revealed a lower amplitude of\nvariation.\nComparison of bulk rainfall at Wallingford, Keyworth and\nValentia with local groundwaters shows some differences\nbetween the areas, probably due to local soil physical or\nhydrogeological factors. Nevertheless, long-term rainfall\nand groundwater isotopic values appear to be reasonably\nrepresentative of each other.\nMaps of the \u03b418O and \u03b42H composition of recent,\nunconfined groundwaters in the British Isles have been\ncompiled largely from survey data. These show depletions\nconsistent with the continental effect. The influence of the\naltitude effect is less obvious but, where explored on the\nlocal scale, agrees broadly with that observed for rainfall in\nPart 1 of this study (Darling and Talbot, 2003).\nThe groundwater maps are considered to represent\nisotopic compositions basically at the present day in\ngeological terms (perhaps decades or possibly centuries old\nin some cases). On a longer timescale, there is evidence\nmainly from the old groundwaters presently found confined\nin major aquifers that isotopic compositions were more\nnegative beyond ~10 ka ago. Maps reconstructing\nunconfined groundwater compositions at around this time\nsuggest that there has been relatively little change in air-\nmass trajectories since then.\nConsideration of the countries and islands around the\nBritish Isles reveals that proximity to the ocean often has a\nprofound effect, with islands more than 10 degrees apart in\nlatitude possessing waters with similar isotopic\ncompositions.\n\u001e\u0010\"\u0012\u000e\u0015\f\u0003\u001c\u001d\u0011\u0003\u0012\t\b\nMost of the groundwater data considered in this paper have\ncome from studies carried out by staff of the British\nGeological Survey over the past quarter-century.
