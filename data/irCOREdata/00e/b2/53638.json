Introduction \n \nThis paper addresses two of the most important questions in Sea Level Science. \nThe first question is, given that global sea level has risen at a rate of \napproximately 1.7 mm\/year during the 20th century, was that value significantly \nlarger than in previous centuries? If the 20th century sea level rise was primarily a \nconsequence of anthropogenic climate change, as suggested by the assessments of \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), then one would have \nexpected there to have been a long-term acceleration in the rate of rise. \n \nThe second question concerns whether evidence exists for significant differences \nbetween rates of change of extreme and mean sea levels. Scientists usually focus \non the latter, as changes in mean values are associated closely to climate-related \nprocesses including oceanic steric change, variations in ice sheet, ice cap and \nglacier mass balance, and hydrological exchanges between land and ocean. \nHowever, people more concerned with impacts of sea level change, including \nthose people who live near to the coast, tend to be interested primarily in evidence \nfor changes in extreme sea levels. \n \nThe understanding of historical mean sea level (MSL) change, and the accurate \nprediction of potential future MSL rise, is a difficult task (as demonstrated by \nother papers in this volume). However, if extremes were to be observed to change \nat different rates, on average, to mean levels, then their understanding and \nprediction would present us with an even more difficult problem. \n \n2. Century-Timescale Acceleration in Sea Level \n \nOne advantage in the study of accelerations, rather than of linear trends, in MSL is \nthat the vertical land movements (VLMs) of the land on which the tide gauges \n(sea level stations) are situated, and which contribute to the observed relative sea \nlevel changes, are in many cases much lower in frequency than the ocean-related \nsignals of interest. Therefore, the quadratic (or higher order) time-dependence of a \nsea level record should be associated primarily with ocean change rather than land \nmovement. This situation applies when the main geological  process responsible \nfor VLM is Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA). However, it will clearly not be \nthe case when the area around a tide gauge experiences earthquakes or when local \ngroundwater pumping of water or hydrocarbons takes place (see Emery and \nAubrey 1991 for many examples of contributions of VLMs to sea level records). \n \nOn the other hand, there is a difficulty in answering our first question (whether the \nsea level changes of the 20th century were significantly larger than in previous \ncenturies and, therefore, whether accelerations in sea level have taken place) due \nto the limited number of long term sea level records spanning two or three \ncenturies. Most long tide gauge records are from northern Europe, constructed \nfrom measurements of high and low waters (or sometimes high waters alone) \nbefore the invention of automatic tide gauges in the mid-19th century enabled the \nmeasurement of the full tidal curve and a computation of MSL. Figure 1(a) is \nadapted from a similar figure shown in Woodworth (1999) and the IPCC Third \n3 \nAssessment Report (TAR, Church et al. 2001). Important modifications are that \nthe Amsterdam record has been extended with the use of data from Den Helder, \nthe Brest time series has been extended back to the 18th century (Pouvreau 2008; \nW\u00f6ppelmann et al. 2008), the Liverpool time series now attempts to reflect MSL \nrather than mean high water change, and the Stockholm record of Ekman (1988) \nhas been updated using data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level \n(PSMSL, www.psmsl.org, Woodworth and Player 2003). If one applies a second-\norder fit (a + bt + ct2 where \u2018t\u2019 is time and \u2018c\u2019 must be doubled to give \nacceleration) to each time series, then quadratic coefficients \u2018c\u2019 of order 0.005 \nmm\/year2 are obtained, all the records shown providing evidence for a long term \nacceleration in sea level, and suggesting that the acceleration commenced around \nthe end of the 19th century or a little later. There is only one other northern \nEuropean record of similar length known to us; that record is from Kronstadt, \nRussia spanning 1773-1993 which had many difficulties in its construction \n(Bogdanov et al. 2000). \n \nThere are no records of similar length elsewhere. However, if one settles for \nsomewhat shorter records and examines time series from the PSMSL Revised \nLocal Reference data set which commence before 1871 and have at least 100 \nyears of data since that time, then one obtains 4 records from the Baltic and North \nSea coasts of Germany. These yield \u2018c\u2019 values between 0.0005 and 0.0062 \nmm\/year2 for the mid-19th century onwards, those values for the German Baltic \nstations being essentially zero. Outside of Europe, the same selection criteria \nprovide only two additional records from San Francisco and New York which \nyield \u2018c\u2019 values of 0.0069 and 0.0038 mm\/year2 respectively since the 1850s, \nconsistent with the acceleration inferred by Maul and Martin (1993) for 1846 \nonwards for Key West, America\u2019s longest, if somewhat gappy, record. These six \nshorter records are shown in Figure 1(b), and have superimposed separate linear \nfits to their 19th and 20th century data as a guide to any acceleration. Altogether, \nFigure 1(a,b) suggests that a century-timescale acceleration applies to the northern \nhemisphere in general, a conclusion further confirmed by the study of saltmarsh \ninformation discussed below. However, the magnitude of the acceleration varies \nbetween stations. Furthermore, it can be seen that for tide gauge records with start \ndates in the mid-19th century or later, it is much more difficult to have confidence \nin the evidence for acceleration between the centuries, given the amount of \ninterannual and decadal variability present in all records (as discussed by Douglas \n1992 and other authors, as is evident visually from Figure 1(a,b), and from a \ncomparison of the formal errors on \u2018c\u2019 values given in the captions to Figures 1(a) \nand (b)). \n \nSeveral studies have been published which have presented \u2018reconstructions\u2019 of \n\u2018global\u2019 sea level change, with the use of both long and short records combined in \nvarious ways (Church and White 2006, 2011; Jevrejeva et al. 2006). Results tend \nto support findings from the individual long records. Church and White (2011) \nhave recently updated their 2006 reconstructions using Empirical Orthogonal \nFunctions (EOFs) of ocean variability as observed by altimetry since 1993, \ntogether with coastal tide-gauge information. They obtained a global-average \nacceleration of sea level between 1880 and 2009 of 0.009 \u00b1 0.003 mm\/year2 \n(quadratic coefficient \u2018c\u2019 = 0.0045 \u00b1 0.0015 mm\/year2). Jevrejeva et al. (2006) \nderived time series of regional and global sea level by combining both short and \nlong tide gauge records from the early part of the 19th century onwards with the \n4 \nuse of a \u2018virtual station\u2019 technique, and demonstrated changes in global sea level \ntrend between the 19th and 20th centuries similar to those of Church and White \n(see comparisons of these analyses in Woodworth et al. 2009a). Jevrejeva et al. \n(2008) attempted to extend the reconstruction analysis over three centuries with \nthe use of the small number of long records, concluding that the long-term \nacceleration could have started nearer to the beginning of the 19th century rather \nthan at its end, as preferred by other studies. \n \nAs might be anticipated, such a period of long-term acceleration consists of \nshorter periods with greater acceleration, or even deceleration. In the review by \nWoodworth et al. (2009a), it was pointed out that most sea level data originate \nfrom Europe and N America and both sets display evidence for a positive \nacceleration, or \u2018inflexion\u2019, around 1920-1930 and a negative one around 1960. \nThese inflexions are the main contributors to the long-term accelerations \nmentioned above, and to the decelerations one tends to find using 20th century \ndata alone (as discussed by Woodworth 1990, Douglas 1992 and Holgate 2007). \nHowever, all of these characteristic features are not found in records from all parts \nof the world. For example, Raicich (2007) presented an extended (backwards) \ntime series for Trieste spanning 1875 onwards which shows an overall secular \ntrend of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 mm\/year with little evidence for long-term acceleration, the \ndownturn after the 1960s, seen particularly strongly in many Mediterranean \nrecords (Tsimplis and Baker 2000), being the single characteristic feature of the \nrecord. \n \nUntil the 1990s, the only evidence for accelerations came from tide gauge data \nand so could not be claimed to be necessarily \u2018global\u2019. Since that time, precise \nradar altimeter data from space have become available (Fu and Cazenave 2001). \nOne notes that the high rates during the 1990s, which represent an acceleration \ncompared to those of the 20th century as a whole, are of similar magnitude in both \ntide gauge and altimeter data. This recent acceleration has been reported by \nHolgate and Woodworth (2004), White et al. (2005) and Prandi et al. (2009), and \nhas been discussed by Rahmstorf et al. (2007). Whether it represents the start of a \nlong term increase in the rate of sea level rise, rather than decadal variability, \nremains to be seen. \n \nIf long, continuous records of sea level are not available from a region, then it \nbecomes especially important to make maximum use of short periods of historical \ninformation where they exist. In particular, this applies to the relatively data-\nsparse southern hemisphere. The essential factor in such studies is that the \nhistorical tide gauge benchmarks must have survived to the present day. For \nexample, Hunter et al. (2003) made use of measurements at Port Arthur, Tasmania \nfrom 1841-2, together with more recent measurements, with the conclusion that \nsea level had risen at an average rate of 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/year, after a small correction \nfor vertical land movement. Woodworth et al. (2010a) performed a similar \nanalysis at Port Louis, Falkland Islands where James Clark Ross measured sea \nlevels in 1842. The long-term rate of change of sea level was estimated to have \nbeen 0.75 \u00b1 0.35 mm\/year between 1842 and the mid-1980s, after correction for \nair pressure effects and for vertical land movement due to GIA. \n \nThese values of sea level change since the mid-19th century do not provide insight \ninto long term acceleration, but they do enable a baseline of change against which \n5 \npresent day rates can be compared. For example, sea level has been rising at \nSpring Bay (near to Port Arthur) at a rate of 3.4 mm\/year since 1991 (uncorrected \nfor vertical land movement which is likely to be small, Table 5 of NTC 2009), \nwhile at Port Stanley (near to Port Louis) the rate of sea level rise observed since \n1992, when the modern Stanley gauge was installed, has been 2.51 \u00b1 0.58 \nmm\/year, after correction for air pressure and GIA (Woodworth et al. 2010a). \nFigure 2 indicates this recent acceleration in the Falkland Islands. These larger \nrates over the last one or two decades are consistent with the picture of a general \nrecent global acceleration with particular contributions from the tropics and from \nhigher southern latitudes (Merrifield et al. 2009a). Other recent studies of \nsouthern hemisphere sea level change that have made use of sections of historical \ninformation include those of Watson et al. (2010) and Testut et al. (2006), \nalthough these investigations are limited to study of 20th century changes. Testut \net al. (2010) have recently studied changes at Saint Paul Island in the southern \nIndian Ocean, finding changes in sea level consistent with zero since 1874, \nalthough without a vertical land movement correction which is problematical at \nthat location. \n \nAlongside study of continuous tide gauge records, and of short sets of data \nseparated by a long period of time, another important category to emphasise is \nthat of gauges which once had sustained, continuous records but which were \ndiscontinued for one reason or other. Woodworth et al. (2009b) have shown how \nuseful information on sea level trends can be obtained from the long historical \nrecords in Takoradi (Ghana), Aden (Yemen) and Karachi (Pakistan) separated by \nmany decades from data obtained from newly installed instruments. Similar \ninstallations of new equipment at sites with long records must form a community \npriority. \n \nIt is well-known that the PSMSL data set is weighted considerably towards the \nnorthern hemisphere (see http:\/\/www.psmsl.org\/products\/data_coverage\/). \nAlthough it is possible that other historical tide gauge data of the types described \nabove may be discovered in archives and analysed (a process called \u2018data \narchaeology\u2019), thereby supplementing the PSMSL data set, it is clear that such \ninformation will always be limited, especially in the southern hemisphere. \nConsequently, other types of sea level information have to be investigated, and \ntheir data sets combined with those from tide gauges, thereby ensuring that our \nknowledge of sea level change over the past two or three centuries is more \nrepresentative globally. \n \nThe complementary techniques might provide sea level time series which are \neither longer than those of tide gauges or come from regions where no gauge \nrecords exist. Possible techniques include the use of archaeological sources in \nareas such as the Mediterranean where tidal amplitudes are small and where \nRoman and other historical artifacts constructed at known heights relative to \nformer sea levels still exist. In tropical areas, high-resolution information from \ncorals can be used to deduce sea level changes over past centuries with sufficient \nprecision to detect accelerations on multi-decadal timescales. Lambeck et al. \n(2010) provide a review of both areas of research.  \n \nSaltmarshes offer another source of sea level information and suitable marshes \nexist throughout the mid- to high-latitudes. Research has shown that in many \n6 \ncircumstances the saltmarshes and nearby tide gauges provide similar information \non timescales of decades to centuries, with the saltmarsh data appearing to a great \nextent to mimic a gauge record with a low-pass filter of approximately a decade \ndepending on the location (Milne et al. 2009). The surface of a saltmarsh is close \nto the high tide level so that, when sea level rises over decades, sediments \naccumulate and the marsh surface builds up vertically. A history of sea level rise \ncan then be reconstructed using micropalaeontological and sediment dating \ntechniques, and the use of a \u2018transfer function\u2019 which depends on an assumption \nthat the vertical distribution (relative to a chosen tide level) of fossil remains in \nthe historical and modern marshes are the same. The need for continuous \nsedimentation means that marsh areas prone to erosion and highly fluctuating \nsedimentation rates, such as the lower saltmarsh and areas near tidal creeks, are to \nbe avoided.  \n \nFigure 3 presents a compilation of findings from western Greenland (Long et al. \n2010), northern Spain (Leorri et al. 2008), Tasmania (Gehrels et al. in prep.), \nIceland (Gehrels et al. 2006), New Zealand (Gehrels et al. 2008), Connecticut \n(Donnelly et al. 2004), North Carolina (Kemp et al. 2009) and Nova Scotia \n(Gehrels et al. 2005) (the individual papers may be consulted for analysis details, \nsee also Woodworth et al. 2009a and Mitchum et al. 2010). Most of the saltmarsh \nrecords contain a rapid acceleration or \u2018inflexion\u2019 as indicated in this schematic \ncompilation. The abruptness of the accelerations seen in the records has been \noften remarked upon and may be partly an artifact of the use of different dating \nmethods at different points in the record. Nevertheless, the general character of \nacceleration seen in the northern European tide gauges can also be seen in the \nvarious saltmarsh data, although the changes of trend between the 19th and 20th \ncenturies suggested by Kemp et al. (2009), for the North American stations at \nleast, would correspond to \u2018c\u2019 values of approximately 0.008 to 0.011 mm\/year2 \nwhich is approximately twice that inferred from the tide gauges. This may be due \nto the longer duration of these records and\/or the \u2018filtering\u2019 effect mentioned \nabove. However, if compaction has affected the sediments, the saltmarsh records \nmay overestimate the sea level acceleration. Checks and, if required, corrections \nfor compaction (e.g. through measurements of bulk density) are critical for \nestablishing accurate sea level records from saltmarsh sediments (e.g. Gehrels et \nal. 2008). That said, the records in Figure 3 are compaction-free or have been \ncorrected for compaction. \n \nAll records, except Greenland and Iceland, show a clear inflexion at the end of the \n19th century or the beginning of the 20th century. The inflexion is most \npronounced in the southern hemisphere records. This could be in line with the \ntheory of sea level \u2018fingerprinting\u2019 (Mitrovica et al. 2001, 2010) if Greenland is a \nsource of the excess sea level rise recorded in the 20th century compared to \npreceding centuries. Similarly, this theory could provide an explanation why the \ninflexion is not present in the records close to the Greenland melt source (Iceland \nand western Greenland itself). On the other hand, it has been suggested that \noceanic steric effects and changes in the ocean circulation may obscure any \ndetectable sea level fingerprint signal (cf. Wake et al. 2006). This \nnotwithstanding, the geographical pattern of the inflexion provides an interesting \nGreenland-melt working hypothesis which requires further testing. It is clearly \nimportant to use an expanded data set to study further the different timings of \naccelerations in different locations and by different methods (saltmarsh, corals, \n7 \ntide gauge, archaeology). Accelerations or inflexions which occur well before the \n20th century are of particular interest as they suggest a natural rather than an \nanthropogenic cause. Those which have occurred in the more highly-instrumented \nmodern era demand consistency between measurement techniques so as to have \nconfidence in the various measurement methods. \n \nWhat may have caused the long-term acceleration between the 19th and 20th \ncenturies seen in many parts of the world? Ultimately, an answer has to come \nfrom proper appreciation of the changing budget of oceanic steric, cryospheric \nand hydrological contributions due to natural (e.g. volcanic, solar) and \nanthropogenic forcings. Budgets have been discussed extensively recently \n(Domingues et al. 2008; Cazenave 2009; Church et al. 2010, 2011). Their findings \nare very encouraging. However, these discussions are from the perspective of the \nlast few decades when most observational data sets have been of adequate quality. \nConsideration of budgets over longer timescales becomes more of a climate, \nglaciological and ocean circulation modelling exercise, and modelling undertaken \nso far has been unable to describe these features adequately.  \n \nOne interesting (if speculative) relevant and recent study is that of Miller and \nDouglas (2007) who discussed evidence for a long-term deceleration in North \nAtlantic gyre strength (spin down), represented by decreasing air pressures near to \nthe centre of the sub-tropical gyre, and for a connection to an acceleration in the \nrate of sea level change at the eastern boundary. A similar inference was made \nfrom the North Pacific data, although the poorer quality air pressure fields \navailable for that ocean prevented as firm a set of conclusions as for the North \nAtlantic. Their analysis was limited to data sets from the late-19th century \nonwards. However, Woodworth et al. (2010b) recently showed that the \nrelationship holds, at a qualitative level for the North Atlantic, for the last two and \na half centuries. Therefore, it is clear that a considerable amount of ocean and \nclimate modelling remains to be performed in order to understand better the \nvarious contributors to global-average sea level rise and to the spatial \nredistribution of water. \n \n3. Changes in Extreme Sea Levels \n \nSimilar considerations of data availability affect studies of extreme sea level \nchanges. However, in this case the problems are much greater. For many years, \nmost countries have contributed MSL information to the PSMSL. Such data were \noften regarded as having little commercial or national security importance, and \nhence could be shared internationally. However, the raw data (typically hourly \nvalues of sea level) were often restricted. Nowadays, the situation is much \nimproved, standard formats for international data exchange have been agreed, and \nthere are no technical reasons why data sets larger than the MSL ones cannot be \nsubmitted to, and quality controlled and archived by, data centres. Nevertheless, it \nremains the case that no raw data are shared by a number of countries with long \ncoastlines (notably India, China and Russia). \n \nA further factor related to data availability concerns the changes of tide gauge \ntechnology during the past half-century. Nowadays, most tide gauges have \n8 \nelectronic data loggers with sea levels transmitted via telephone or satellite to data \ncentres (although at different frequencies in different countries). In previous years, \nmost tide gauges comprised stilling wells with floats connected to paper charts \nthat required relatively simple inspection (for noting of high and low waters and \nthereby computation of Mean Tide Levels) or digitisation (for extraction of hourly \nvalues and computation of Mean Sea Levels). In some countries, charts remain \nundigitised, or worse have been destroyed. The consequence is that, while a small \nnumber of long records of hourly (or similar) sea levels exist, the vast majority of \nuseful available records span the past few decades only. One must recognise the \nexcellent work of international programmes and data centres (notably the \nUniversity of Hawaii Sea Level Center), the work of which through programmes \nsuch as TOGA (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere) and WOCE (World Ocean \nCirculation Experiment) has provided enhanced data sets for the latter part of the \n20th century (Woodworth et al. 2003). \n \nWhen equipped with such a dataset of hourly sea levels from typically the 1970s \nonwards, one can ask if there is evidence for extremes having changed at different \nrates to MSL. A first attempt to address this question on a quasi-global basis was \nmade by Woodworth and Blackman (2004) and has since been updated and \nextended by Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth (2010) who made use of a quasi-global \nsea level data set called GESLA (Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis) compiled \nthrough a collaborative activity of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems \nCooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC), Australia and the National \nOceanography Centre (NOC), Liverpool, UK. \n \nThey applied a non-stationary extreme value analysis to the monthly maxima of \ntotal elevations and surges for the period 1970 onwards, while a small subset of \nthe data was used to study changes over the 20th century. The analyses \ndemonstrate the magnitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of extreme sea level \noccurrence, the magnitude of long-term trends in extreme sea levels, the evidence \nfor perigean and nodal astronomical tidal components in the extremes, and the \nrelationship of the interannual variability in high water levels to other ocean and \natmosphere variations as represented by climate indices. \n \nExtreme sea levels were found to have increased at most locations around the \nworld, as suggested by many anecdotal reports of increased coastal flooding. \nHowever, the subtraction from the extreme sea levels of the corresponding annual \nmedian sea level was found to result in a reduction in the magnitude of trends at \nmost stations, leading to the conclusion that much of the change in extremes is \ndue to change in the mean values. This is clearly an important conclusion for \ncoastal planners, if that conclusion applies also to the future, as predictions of \nMSL change are difficult and uncertain enough without additional uncertainties \nbeing introduced with regard to projected extremes. \n \nThis finding is illustrated in Figure 4 which shows trends in the 99% percentiles \nof sea level, as measured (top) and with median sea level for each year removed \n(middle). The red dots at many tide gauge locations in the upper figure \ndemonstrate the generally positive trends in extreme sea levels in recent decades. \nHowever, most red dots disappear in the middle figure when median sea levels are \nsubtracted. Meanwhile, the bottom figure indicates that trends in 99% percentiles \nof non-tidal residuals (where mean residual is defined to be zero for each year and \n9 \nso \u2018residual\u2019 can be considered as a \u2018surge\u2019 component, see Men\u00e9ndez and \nWoodworth 2010 for details) are negative at many locations, providing little or no \nevidence for increasing storminess in general and supporting the view that \nincreases in measured extremes (top) have been due to MSL changes.  \n \nA related finding is demonstrated by Figure 5. The upper figure indicates that \nextreme sea levels have become more frequent at most locations since the 1970s. \nHowever, when median sea level values are subtracted from the high percentiles, \nmuch smaller long-term changes in frequency of extreme events are found. \nMen\u00e9ndez and Woodworth (2010) also pointed to the importance of climate \nvariability on the extreme sea level trends, including in particular the El Ni\u00f1o \u2013 \nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). \n \nA large number of investigations have been made of changes in extreme sea levels \nby other authors. However, most studies have tended to concentrate on changes at \nparticular locations. A problem in synthesising findings from this body of work \nstems from the fact that each analysis is made over different timescales and with \nthe use of different methods (percentiles, peak over threshold, generalised extreme \nvalue, joint probably, revised joint probability etc.) It is the nature of the problem \nwhen studying extremes that one is sensitive to the statistical properties of small \nsamples, and each method employs the small amounts of data in different ways. A \nreview of such publications has been made recently by Lowe et al. (2010), with \nthe main conclusion once again that changes in extremes parallel those in MSL, \nalthough with exceptions to this general rule.  \n \nMore recent publications, not contained in the Lowe et al. review, include the \nfollowing papers, with a focus on Europe and the Mediterranean; we know of few \nrecent papers on extreme sea levels from outside Europe since the review. Note \nthat the following does not extend the Lowe et al. review of changes in waves, \nneither does it update discussion of the projected changes in 21st century \nextremes. Both latter topics will be covered extensively in an upcoming IPCC \nspecial report on extreme events (IPCC 2011).  \n \nHaigh et al. (2010) used a data set obtained from 18 tide gauges on the UK and \nFrench sides of the English Channel spanning 1900-2006. Changes in the surge, \ntide and MSL components in the records were analysed separately and in \ncombination. Extreme sea levels were found to increase at all sites but at rates not \nsignificantly different from those in MSL. Ullmann and Monbaliu (2010) found \nthat the wintertime 99th percentile of daily maximum sea level at Ostend in \nBelgium had increased at a rate of approximately 3 mm\/year between 1925 and \n2000, which can be largely understood as a combination of a rise in wintertime \nMSL of around 2 mm\/year and of daily maximum sea surge of approximately +1 \nmm\/year. Changes in the occurrence of large surges were further studied in terms \nof modifications of weather r\u00e9gimes over the North Atlantic. \n \nTurning to southern Europe, Lowe et al. (2010) reported that Ullmann et al. \n(2007) had concluded that maximum annual sea levels had risen twice as fast as \nMSL during the 20th  century (4 rather than 2 mm\/year) in the Camargue (Rhone \nDelta) region of southern France, largely due to changes in the wind field in \nrecent decades. Related publications concerned with this particular locality \ninclude Moron and Ullmann (2005), Ullman and Moron (2008) and Ullmann et al. \n10 \n(2008) who studied the relationships between air pressure, winds and storm surges \nin the area, and in particular the link between large surges and the negative phase \nof the NAO. \n \nMarcos et al. (2009) employed data from 73 gauges covering the period 1940 \nonwards. The spatial distribution of extremes of tidal residuals (i.e. of non-tidal \nvariability) was found to be well represented by those of a 2-D hydrodynamic \nmodel, although the model was found to underestimate the magnitude of the \nextremes. The interannual and decadal variability of extremes was found to be \ncaused by MSL changes, with variability in both MSL and extremes being \ncorrelated negatively with the winter NAO index. Tsimplis et al. (2009) used data \nfrom 3 gauges in southern Europe (Coru\u00f1a on the Atlantic coast of Spain, Malaga \nin the western Mediterranean and Trieste in the northern Adriatic) to study the \neffect of alteration of sampling frequency of the tide gauges on computed return \nperiods of extremes. Differences of several centimeters were found in individual \nextremes obtained from hourly and 5-minute sampling, resulting in differences in \n50-year return period levels of decimeters (maximum difference of 38 cm at \nTrieste).   \n \nA seasonal climatology of extremes in southern Europe, including the \nMediterranean, was presented by Tsimplis and Shaw (2010) who also found \ntrends in high percentiles of hourly values to be largely removed when the 50% \npercentile (essentially the MSL) was removed. Letetrel et al. (2010) used hourly \nsea levels from Marseille for 1885-2008 and undertook a percentile analysis to \ninvestigate long-term trends of extremes. They concluded that secular variations \nin extreme sea levels are linked to MSL variations. However, decadal timescale \nvariations in extremes showed differences to those in MSL. Changes in the return \nperiod levels of extremes were also studied, determining that an increase in levels \nhad occurred since the 1970s. \n \nIn a study related to extremes but not discussing them per se, Vilibi\u0107 and \u0160epi\u0107 \n(2009) used data from 6 long records around Europe as representative of the \nregion requiring each record to contain at least half a century of hourly or similar \ndata. They investigated variability in 4 frequency bands and considered how well \nthe sea level variability was associated with storminess in the atmosphere and \nvariation in storm tracks.  \n \nOutside of Europe, Lowe et al. (2010) referred to the study of Bromirski et al. \n(2003) who undertook a study of meteorologically-forced non-tidal residuals at \nSan Francisco since 1858, concluding that winter non-tidal residuals had exhibited \na significant increasing trend since about 1950. Cayan et al. (2008) have since \ncomplemented that work, concluding that the 99.99th  percentile of measured sea \nlevel had increased considerably at San Francisco (by 20-fold since 1915) and at \nLa Jolla (by 30-fold since 1933). Abeysirigunawardena and Walker (2008) \ndiscussed possible acceleration in MSL rise during the 20th century at Prince \nRupert in British Columbia, Canada. Sea level extremes were found to have risen \nat approximately 3.4 mm\/year since 1945, which was twice the rate for MSL in \nthat time, the additional amount of rise being suggested as due to ENSO-related \nregional interannual variability. This is one example of findings for which \nextremes appear to be rising faster than MSL. \n \n11 \nTurning to South America, Fiore et al. (2009) found an increase in the number and \nheight of positive surges at Mar del Plata in Argentina during the recent decade \n(1996\u20132005) compared to the previous half-century, consistent with findings from \nBuenos Aires by D\u2019Onofrio et al. (2008). Both of these analyses were consistent \nwith a rise in MSL being the responsible mechanism. Finally, from a more \nworldwide perspective of information on extremes, one can point to regular \nannual reporting of extreme levels published in the Bulletin of the American \nMeteorological Society (e.g. Merrifield et al. 2009b). \n \nAdvanced methods for studying extreme sea levels have also been published. For \nexample, Mudersbach and Jensen (2010) developed a method which has some \nsimilarity to that described in Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth (2010). They developed \na nonstationary extreme value analysis statistical approach, based on the \ngeneralized extreme value (GEV) distribution and an L-moment parameter \nestimation, which was employed to derive future design water levels. In addition, \nmethods for best estimating extremes in the future have also been published since \nthe Lowe et al. review. Thompson et al. (2009) considered two approaches for \nassessing the likely impact of changes in extremes in Atlantic Canada: a \ndynamical modelling approach, and a method based on statistical analysis of \nexisting sea level data. Both methods provide a satisfactory description of present \nday flooding probabilities for regions with large tides, but both also have \nlimitations with regard to the computation of future changes in the distribution of \nlevels. Hunter (2010) described a method of combining observations of present \nsea level extremes with the (uncertain) projections for sea level rise during the 21st \ncentury, with assumptions that most of the changes in extremes will be due to \nMSL rise and that changes in variability about the mean will be small. A method \nof estimating exceedance probability during the 21st century was devised, using \nAustralian data as an example.   \n \nA number of recent publications have pointed to long-term changes in the ocean \ntide which are larger than one would expect from simple changes in depth due to \nMSL rise (Jay 2009; Ray 2009; Woodworth 2010). At the least, these papers \nremind us that changes in extreme sea levels can originate from more than one \nsource (i.e. changes in tides rather than, or as well as, storm surges or MSL).   \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nStudies of long term changes in \u2018global\u2019 mean or extreme sea levels cannot be \nmade without data sets of high quality and as good spatial and temporal coverage \nas possible. In the past few years, one can point to general improvements in data \nsets due primarily to developments in the Global Sea Level Observing System \n(GLOSS) programme and to refurbishment in several ocean areas, notably in the \nIndian Ocean following the Andaman Tsunami in 2004. In addition, one can point \nto detailed \u2018data archaeology\u2019 exercises at a number of locations, especially in the \nsouthern hemisphere. However, it is clear that a lot of further effort in historical \ndata acquisition and analysis is required. \n \nA major conclusion from this body of work is that the global (or at least the \nnorthern hemisphere) ocean has experienced an acceleration in the rate of sea \n12 \nlevel change between the 19th and 20th centuries, within which have been \nparticular periods of greater or smaller acceleration. This conclusion was first \nobtained by inspection of the small number of long tide gauge records but has \nsince been verified by the research into the use of saltmarsh data. An adequate \nexplanation for the acceleration in terms of the budget of contributors to sea level \nchange remains to be obtained. A second conclusion has particular practical as \nwell as scientific importance but is applicable to a shorter period of decades rather \nthan centuries. It appears that rates of change in extreme sea levels are similar to \nthose in mean levels, although this general finding does not apply at every \nlocation. It is to be hoped that as data sets are enhanced, both spatially and \ntemporally, that considerably greater insight will be obtained into the long term \nchanges of extreme and mean sea levels and also the reasons for change.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank Dr. Margot Saher of the University of Plymouth for assistance with the production of \nFigure 3. \n \n \n13 \nReferences \nAbeysirigunawardena DS, Walker IJ (2008) Sea level responses to climatic variability and change \nin Northern British Columbia.

The Brest record is a mean sea level time series \nderived from mean high waters as described by Pouvreau (2008) and Woodworth et al. (2010b). \nThe Liverpool series has been derived in a similar manner using the \u2018adjusted mean high waters\u2019 \nof Woodworth (1999). These two records are denoted by \u2018HC\u2019 (\u2018high water computation\u2019) and are \nshown in red. The Den Helder record shown in black has been adjusted to have the same mean \nvalue as Amsterdam for the period of overlap. The vertical scale is indicated by the \u00b1 100 mm \nerror bars. The six time series yield \u2018c\u2019 coefficient values of 0.0037 \u00b1 0.0002, 0.0015 \u00b1 0.0005, \n0.0091 \u00b1 0.0015, 0.0057 \u00b1 0.0008, 0.0036 \u00b1 0.0010 and 0.0049 \u00b1 0.0012 mm\/year2 respectively, \ntop to bottom. \n \n(b) Records starting in the mid-19th century for 4 stations in Germany (in blue) and 2 in North \nAmerica (in red). The vertical scale is indicated by the \u00b1 100 mm error bars. The six time series \nyield \u2018c\u2019 coefficient values of 0.0037 \u00b1 0.0016, 0.0014 \u00b1 0.0014, 0.0005 \u00b1 0.0014, 0.0062 \u00b1 \n0.0020, 0.0038 \u00b1 0.0014 and 0.0069 \u00b1 0.0019 mm\/year2 respectively, top to bottom. The black \nlines are separate linear fits to 19th and 20th century data, as a guide to any acceleration between \nthe centuries. \n \n2.  Large dots indicate values of corrected sea level (SLC, i.e. sea level corrected for air pressure \neffects and for the seasonal cycle in SLC) at and near to Port Louis in the Falkland Islands. Values \nare shown relative to the height of the main (\u2018Ross\u2019) benchmark. The star indicates SLC during a \nfortnight measurement period at Port Louis in February-March 2009. Also shown are monthly \nmean values of SLC from the permanent tide gauge station at Port Stanley that have been related \nto those at Port Louis with the use of overlapping data sets. The dash-dotted trend line connects the \n1842 value to the 1981-2 and 1984 values, while the solid line is a linear fit to the Port Stanley \nSLC data since 1992 extrapolated back to the early 1980s.

(Figure updated from that in Gehrels 2010. See the text for the individual \nreferences). \n \n4. Estimated trends in (top) annual 99th percentile of sea level, (middle) 99th percentile reduced to \nmedians, and (bottom) 99th percentile of the non-tidal residual. Only trends at confidence level \nabove 95% are shown by larger colour dots: red for positive and blue for negative trends. (Adapted \nfrom Men\u00e9ndez and Woodworth 2010). \n \n5. Estimated changes in the frequency of extreme sea level events for (a) the measured sea level \ntime series, and (b) for time series with annual median removed.
