The general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were\nestimated using the method 4, model I analysis of Griffing for grain yield kernel weight, grain number,\nharvest index, green leaf number, ear leaf area, N utilization efficiency, total plant N, grain N content,\nanthesis-silking interval, chlorophyll content and prolificacy. For the majority of the traits, GCA was\nmore important than SCA and there was an increase of non-additive effects under low N. Significant\ninteractions were observed between GCA and N levels for grain yield, grain number and chlorophyll\ncontent, indicating the selection of different lines for each N level. The lines with the largest effects\nof N supply per se on grain yield, were those with the largest effects of GCA for this trait. This\nassociation indicates that the response of the lines to N supply, should be considered in breeding\nprogrammes in order to achieve acceptable hybrids for environments with both high and low N.\nINTRODUCTION\nNitrogen is an essential element for plant growth,\nwith amino acids being the major nitrogen containing\ncompounds and protein constituents (Azevedo et al.\n2003, 2004; Kra\u00a8mer 2004). One of the major limita-\ntions for maize productivity in world agriculture is a\ndeficiency of nitrogen (N; Thomason et al. 2002).\nHowever, the application of excess N is a major\nconcern when other agricultural aspects and en-\nvironmental and public health are considered\n(McKnight et al. 1999). Several possibilities exist for\nreducing the problems of N shortage and waste, such\nas the use of green or organic manure (Kumar & Goh\n2000; Nicholson et al. 2003; Papastylianou 2004),\nsymbiotic fixation of N2 (James & Olivares 1998),\nreducing the application of N (Fernande\u00b4z et al. 1998),\noptimizing the timing of N application (Raun &\nJohnson 1999) and genetic selection (Lafitte &\nEdmeades 1994; Santos et al. 1998; Machado\n& Fernandes 2001; Kamara et al. 2003) and the\ninsertion of new genes by plant transformation\n(Andrews et al. 2004).\nPlant breeding for nitrogen use efficiency, which\nis a combination of the efficiency of uptake, trans-\nlocation and utilization of N (Moll et al. 1982), could\nbe accelerated in maize by the selection of secondary\ntraits that possess high heritability and correlation\nwith productivity (Ba\u00a8nziger & Lafitte 1997). A num-\nber of secondary traits have been studied, e.g.\nchlorophyll content, plant height, timing of leaf sen-\nescence (estimated by the number of green leaves be-\nlow the ear after anthesis), anthesis-silking interval,\ngrain number, prolificacy (ears\/plant), enzymes of N\nand antioxidant metabolism, and quantitative trait-\nloci (Lafitte & Edmeades 1994; Bertin & Gallais\n2000; Hirel et al. 2001; Wilson et al. 2003; Medici\n* To whom all correspondence should be addressed.\nEmail : raazeved@esalq.usp.br\nJournal of Agricultural Science (2004), 142, 535\u2013541. f 2004 Cambridge University Press 535\ndoi:10.1017\/S002185960400468X Printed in the United Kingdom\net al. 2004). There is also an important question con-\ncerning genotype specificity for low or high N supply.\nPrevious research by Muruli & Paulsen (1981) and\nAgrama et al. (1999) has identified specific genotypes\nthat yield well at either low or at high N supply,\nwhereas Lafitte & Edmeades (1994) have obtained\ngenotypes with a good performance under both low\nand high N supply.\nMaize breeding programmes for low N supply have\nbeen carried out with varieties and hybrids (Santos\net al. 1998; Machado & Fernandes 2001) and such\nprogrammes require genetic information about sec-\nondary traits related to nitrogen use, correlations\nbetween lines and hybrids and interactions among\ngenotypes and N levels. The present authors have\npreviously identified maize lines with contrasting\nresponse to N supply for grain yield and secondary\ntraits (Medici et al. 2005). One of these lines,\nnumbered 6, was identified as the most tolerant to N\ndeficiency, since it exhibited the highest grain yield\nat low N and did not respond to additional N,\nwhile line 2 was identified as responsive to high\nN supply, exhibiting the highest increase in grain yield\nfollowing the application of high N. To gain more\ninsight into the nitrogen use of maize, the current\ndiallel study was carried out using the previously\nidentified maize lines, to investigate grain yield and\nsecondary traits.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nPlant material\nThe 15 possible hybrids of six S5 lines of maize (Zea\nmays L.), developed at the Universidade Federal\nRural do Rio de Janeiro, were used. The lines 2, 3, 4\nand 10, were derived from the commercial hybrid AG\n311, whereas the lines 5 and 6 originated from the\ncommercial hybrid AG 302 (Agroceres seed com-\npany, Brazil). The contrasting responses to N supply\nof these lines are reported in Medici et al. (2005),\nwhich had two experiments. In the first, N supplied\nappeared to be in excess and only increased the grain\nyield in line 2 and increased the chlorophyll content in\nall lines except line 3. In the second experiment, there\nwas a severe N deficiency that caused a reduction in\ngrain yield in lines 2, 3, 5 and 10, chlorophyll content\nin all lines, prolificacy in lines 2, 3, 4 and 5, grain N\ncontent in all lines except line 10 and total plant N in\nlines 2, 3 and 5. In addition, the severe N deficiency\ncaused an increase in kernel weight in line 2 and\nanthesis-silking interval in lines 3 and 5. In these\nprevious experiments, line 2 had the highest anthesis-\nsilking interval and line 6 had the lowest value for this\ntrait. Lines 2 and 6 were identified as having high\nchlorophyll content, while line 4 showed a low value\nfor this trait. For prolificacy, line 2 was identified as\nhaving high value.\nField site\nThe experiment was conducted at the Anhembi\nexperimental field station of the Escola Superior de\nAgricultura Luiz de Queiroz \u2013 Universidade de Sa\u02dco\nPaulo (ESALQ\/USP), Piracicaba, Brazil in 2001. The\nsoil type was Yellow Latosoil and soil analysis of the\nfirst 20 cm depth showed pH \u2013 4.4; organic matter \u2013\n26 g\/dm3 ; P \u2013 63 mg\/dm3 ; K \u2013 0.55 cmolc\/dm\n3 ; Ca \u2013\n14 cmolc\/dm\n3 ; Mg \u2013 0.7 cmolc\/dm\n3 ; Al \u2013 0.6 cmolc\/\ndm3 ; H+Al \u2013 4.2 cmolc\/dm3. This experiment was\ncarried out at the same time and in the same area as\nthe second experiment reported in Medici et al.\n(2005), which evaluated the parent lines of the hybrids\nused in the present work.\nExperimental design\nThe experimental design was a factorial of 15 hybrids,\nby two levels of N supply (10 and 130 kg N\/ha as\nurea) in a randomized complete block design with six\nreplicates. Each plot consisted of one row 5 m long,\nwith plants 0.2 m apart. All rows were spaced at 0.9 m\napart, at a within-row distance of 0.2 m between\nplants.\nAnalyses\nThe traits measured in this experiment were selected\nbecause they have been used in previous research into\nbreeding for tolerance to N deficiency in maize.\nSantos et al. (1998) used anthesis-silking interval in\nthe selection of a population which showed improved\ngrain yield in low N soil and Lafitte & Edmeades\n(1994) showed similar results using anthesis-silking\ninterval, ear leaf area and number of green leaves\nbelow the upper ear.\nAnthesis-silking interval was the number of days\nbetween when 0.5 of the plants exhibited anther\nemergence and when 0.5 of the plants exhibited silk\nemergence. Prolificacy was based on the total number\nof ears from all of the plants in the plot. Grain data\nwere recorded after the ears had been dried to a uni-\nform moisture level (120 g moisture\/kg) and adjusted\nfor dryweight. Kernel weight was taken from a sample\nfrom each plot. The ear leaf area was taken after\nsilking, from the leaf immediately below the upper ear\nfor four plants in each plot, and was obtained by\nmultiplying maximum width by length by 0.75\n(Giauffret et al. 1997). The number of green leaves\nbelow the upper ear was taken for four plants in each\nplot and this trait was determined 2 weeks after an-\nthesis. Leaf chlorophyll content was determined with\nportable equipment SPAD 502 (Minolta, Ramsay,\nNew Jersey), using 10 plants per plot and twomeasure-\nments per plant on the ear leaf, 25 days after the\naverage anthesis date. Four whole above-ground\nplants were harvested at maturity. These plants were\n536 L. O. MEDIC I ET AL.\ndried and assayed for total N content, using a\nKjeldahl method. The N utilization efficiency, defined\nby Moll et al. (1982) as grain yield per unit of N in the\nwhole plant, was calculated as the weight (g) of the\ngrain per four plant samples divided by the total N (g)\nof the same sample. This efficiency indicates the\nability of the plant to produce grain weight using the\namount of N accumulated in the whole-above ground\nplant tissues. These four plants were also used to cal-\nculate the harvest index as the ratio between the grain\nyield and the whole-above ground plant dry weight.\nThe general combining ability (GCA) and specific\ncombining ability (SCA) information were obtained\nby using the method 4, model I analysis of Griffing\n(1956). The ratio between GCA and SCA was\nobtained according to Baker (1978). The interactions\nbetween combining abilities and nitrogen levels were\nobtained according to Vencovsky & Barriga (1992),\ncalculating the square sum of the interaction as the\nsquare sum for low N plus the square sum for high\nN minus the square sum for the average of these N\nlevels.\nRESULTS\nThe traits studied can be grouped according to their\nsignificances for effects on GCA and SCA under high\nand low N levels. The grain yield, grain number and\nchlorophyll content exhibited significant effects for\ninteraction of GCA with N levels. The kernel weight,\ngreen leaf number, ear leaf area, nitrogen utilization\nefficiency and grain nitrogen content exhibited sig-\nnificant effects on GCA at both N levels. The harvest\nindex, plant total N, anthesis-silking interval and\nprolificacy exhibited significant effects for GCA only\nat the high N level. In contrast, the anthesis-silking\ninterval did not exhibit a significant effect for SCA,\nwhile the green leaf number and the ear leaf area\nexhibited significant effects only at the low N level.\nAll other traits exhibited significant effects on SCA at\nboth N levels (Table 1).\nInteraction of GCA with N levels was observed in\nline 2, which had the highest effect for grain yield and\nchlorophyll content at high N, but had only the third\nhighest effect at low N. Line 6 exhibited the greatest\ninteraction for grain number, since it had the highest\nvalue at high N, but the third highest at low N. Line 5\nshowed low interaction of GCA for grain yield with\nthe highest value at low N and the second highest at\nhigh N. Line 10 also had a low interaction, with the\nthird and the second highest effects at high and low N\nlevels respectively (Table 2).\nTable 1.

Line 5 exhibited\nhigh values for kernel weight, ear leaf area and total\nplant N, but a low value for prolificacy. Line 10 had\nhigh values for kernel weight, harvest index, green\nleaf number, N utilization efficiency and prolificacy,\nwhilst line 2 exhibited high values for green leaf\nnumber, N utilization efficiency, prolificacy and\nanthesis-silking interval. Line 6 had the lowest value\nfor anthesis-silking interval.\nNone of the traits analysed exhibited significant\ninteraction of SCA effects with N level, therefore\nthese effects were calculated as the average across all\nlines (Table 4). The hybrid 2r10 exhibited inter-\nmediate effects of SCA for grain yield, N utilization\nefficiency and prolificacy: the parents of this hybrid\nexhibited high values for the effects of GCA for these\ntraits.\nIn general, the hybrids with positive SCA effects on\ngrain N content showed negative SCA effects for\nmost of the other traits. The opposite behaviour was\nalso present, since the hybrids with positive values of\nSCA effects for grain N content showed negative\nvalues of SCA effects for most of the other traits\n(Table 4). Among the traits, the lines with high\ndivergence for GCA effects also exhibited high SCA,\nbut the opposite was observed for grain N content\n(Tables 3 and 4).\nDISCUSSION\nGenetic studies of nitrogen use efficiency in maize\nhave been made by a number of researchers (Ba\u00a8nziger\n& Lafitte 1997; Agrama et al. 1999; Hirel et al. 2001;\nKamara et al. 2003), and the present study has\ncontinued this approach. Contrasting responses of\nagronomic traits to applied N have previously been\nreported (Medici et al., 2005);moreover, the induction\nof new glutathione reductase isoforms in response to\napplied N in the maize lines used in this present study\nhas also been observed (Medici et al. 2004).\nTable 3.

O. MEDIC I ET AL.\nOverall, there was a greater additive than non-\nadditive effect for the evaluated traits. Similar results\nwere also found for N-related traits in maize (Rizzi\net al. 1993). However, N deficiency increased the\nrelative importance of non-additive effects for grain\nyield, grain number, harvest index, ear leaf area, total\nplant N and anthesis-silking interval. The increase of\nheterosis by environmental stress has been reported\nfor maize (Betran et al. 2003).\nThe significance of the effects of GCA indicates\nthat at least one of the maize lines differs in content\nof favourable genes with additive effects, while the\nsignificance of SCA indicates that there is com-\nplementation between lines at loci with some degree\nof non-additive effects. The interaction of GCA with\nN levels indicates that there is no consistency amongst\nadditive effects of lines at both N levels (Vencovsky &\nBarriga 1992), suggesting the selection of different\nlines at each N level.\nLine 6 exhibited the second highest GCA effect\nfor grain number, but this advantage was not very\nimportant for grain yield since this line also exhibited\na low GCA effect for kernel weight. Line 6 also had\nthe lowest GCA effect for anthesis-silking interval\nand the association between this trait and grain\nnumber has previously been demonstrated (Ca\u00b4rcova\net al. 2000). In addition, line 6 was identified as having\na very short anthesis-silking interval (Medici et al.,\n2005), as found by Lafitte & Edmeades (1995), who\ndemonstrated an association for this trait between\nvalues of lines and their effects of GCA. This associ-\nation was also observed in line 2, which was identified\nas having the highest value of anthesis-silking interval\n(Medici et al., 2005) and had the highest GCA\neffect for this trait. The non-additive effects were\nmore important for prolificacy than for anthesis-\nsilking interval, as also observed by Guei & Wassom\n(1992) in maize.\nLines 2 and 6 were identified as having a high\nchlorophyll content and had high GCA effects for this\ntrait, while line 4 was identified as having a low\nchlorophyll content (Medici et al., 2005) and also\na low GCA effect. Lafitte & Edmeades (1995) also\nfound a high association between the values of\nlines and their GCA effects for chlorophyll content,\nwhich has been cited as a trait useful for indicating\nenvironmental variation by Ba\u00a8nzinger & Lafitte\n(1997).\nThe behaviour of grain N content indicates a\nputative expression of negative dominance, beside\nnegative correlations with grain yield, which have\npreviously been reported in maize (Bletsos & Goulas\n1999).\nSelection for N utilization efficiency would be bet-\nter performed at low N, since at this level the relative\nimportance of additive effects was higher than at high\nN. Selection for prolificacy and harvest index would\nbe better performed at high N, because only at this\nlevel was there significance for GCA abilities for these\ntraits. Significant interactions were observed between\nGCA and N levels for grain yield, grain number and\nchlorophyll content, indicating the selection of dif-\nferent lines at each N level.\nThere was no association between the behaviour of\nlines per se at low N and their GCA effects at this\nlevel. Only lines 4 and 6 were identified as having no\nsignificant grain yield reduction due to N deficiency,\nand line 6 was also identified as having the highest\ngrain yield at low N (Medici et al., 2005), however\nthese lines had the two lowest effects of GCA at low\nN for this trait. This result agrees with Lafitte &\nEdmeades (1995) who also observed that the best S3\nmaize lines at low N were not those with best effects\nof GCA at this level. The lack of association between\ngrain yield of lines and grain yield of their hybrids was\nalso observed by Balko & Russel (1980) and by Krone\n& Lambert (1995a, b). However, previous studies\nwith maize have shown varied degrees of correlation\nbetween line and hybrid performance under low-N\napplication, ranging from a weak to a fairly strong\nrelationship. Zaidi et al. (2003) observed that the re-\nlationship between the grain yield of mid-parent and\nhybrids was comparatively stronger under low N ap-\nplication. They suggested that the performance of\nhybrid progenies under low N can be predicted on the\nbasis of advance generation elite inbred parents, with\nproven performance across a range of N applications.\nThe lines with high grain yield response to N supply\nhad large effects of GCA for this trait. Only line 2\nshowed a grain yield response to high N supply in the\nprevious experiment (Medici et al., 2005). This line\nhad the largest GCA effect for this trait at high N and\nthe third best effect at low N. Line 5 was also ident-\nified as having a good response to N supply (Medici\net al., 2005) and had the largest GCA effect for grain\nyield at low N and the second largest at high N.\nKrone & Lambert (1995a, b) showed that the lines\nselected at a high N level produced better hybrids for\ngrain yield than those selected at low N. Balko &\nRussel (1980) reported that nine out of ten important\nparent lines of commercial maize hybrids had a\nhigh response of grain yield to N supply. Duvick\n(1992) also indicated that lines with a high N response\nto N supply would be good for use as parents of\nhybrids. This was because the parents of American\nsimple cross hybrids of maize were selected for\ntolerance to high N supply and these new hybrids are\nbetter for grain yield at low and high N supply than\nold American hybrids (Duvick 1984). Frova et al.\n(1999) reported that a line sensitive to drought\nprovided a large number of alleles for grain yield.\nThey argued that the sensitivity of grain yield to\ndrought could have a different genetic control than\ngrain yield.\nThe lines identified as having a large response to N\nsupply for grain yield, exhibited high GCA effects for\nDiallel analysis of maize lines 539\nthis trait, while the lines with low response to N\nsupply exhibited low GCA effects. This association\nindicates that the response of a line to N supply\nshould be considered in any future maize breeding\nprogramme in order to achieve acceptable hybrids for\nenvironments with high and low N. The results ob-\ntained indicate that maize lines must not be discarded\nbased on their performance or GCA effect at one\nspecific N level. Lines and hybrids should be tested\nat a range of different N levels to ensure that\nhigh-quality genotypes are not lost. In addition the\nmaize lines could be tested under both high and low N\nlevels and those with greater contrast for grain yield\nand also for secondary traits like chlorophyll content\ncould be selected to produce hybrids. It would appear\nthat this approach has not been proposed before\nand needs further confirmation with a greater number\nof lines.\nREFERENCES\nAGRAMA, H. A. S., ZAKARIA, A. G., SAID, F.
