The paper begins with a general description of vocational science in the UK, to\nput the work in context. It then outlines an analysis of the ways in which these students\napproach problems involving converting between units of measurement. Finally the\ndevelopment and evaluation of computer-based activities designed to support students in\nlearning about unit conversion are described.\nIntroduction and background\nWithin this paper we discuss some of the results of a research project in which we analysed\nthe ways in which vocational science students approached problems involving converting\nbetween units of measurement, in the context of science. The project also involved the\ndevelopment and evaluation of computer-based activities written to support pupils in\nlearning about conversions. We started from the premise that learning to convert between\nunits of measurement is critical to a learners' development in the realm of science and that\nhaving access to a general method would support students' efficiency in converting. Our\nfocus on the role of a general rule for converting arose out of a detailed observational\nstudy of students working through their science courses (Molyneux and Sutherland, 1996).\nAs a backdrop to our research, we will first discuss the vocational education context in the\nUK.\nVocational education in the UK has undergone quite substantial changes since the\nbeginning of the 1990s. One product has been the creation of school- and college-based\nvocational qualifications (GNVQs) which are in some way equivalent to the more\ntraditional academic courses, in recognition of the different purposes of academic and\nvocational learning (Dealing, 1996). The model for the new qualification was influenced by\n89\nAnne Butterfield et al Learning conversions in science: the case of vocational students in the UK\nstudies of the German, Austrian and Swiss education systems in which the academic and\nvocational tracks are separate but where the vocational track has high status due, partially,\nto its substantial content of general education (Hodgson and Spours, 1997).\nIt was hoped that the broad vocational route afforded by the new GNVQs would attract\nsome students away from the academic pathway in order to increase participation and\nachievement at the vocational level and increase the numbers remaining in education.\nHistorically there have always been vocational awards in the UK but these have never been\nattractive to the vast majority of post-16 students and have usually been taught in the post-\n16 further education colleges and not in schools. The new school- and college-based\nvocational qualifications, targeted at the 16-19 age group and equivalent to the academic\nA levels, are called Advanced General National Vocational Qualifications. Today, the\nnumber of 16-year-old students participating in Advanced GNVQs is greater than that in\nother advanced vocational qualifications by three to one. However these students have not\nbeen attracted away from the academic A levels but from the other existing vocational\ncourses such as the Business and Technical Education (BTEC) and City and Guilds awards\n(Robinson, 1996; Spours, 1997).\nThe expansion of GNVQs at the expense of the more traditional vocational awards has not\nbeen matched by student achievement (Spours, 1997). The GNVQ successful completion\nrate of 55 per cent is lower than that of both the long-standing vocational and academic\nawards where, for example, a successful completion rate of over 70 per cent is typical for\nBTEC National awards and A-levels (Robinson, 1996; Spours, 1997).\nGNVQs are available in fifteen subject areas including Leisure and Tourism, Business\nStudies and Science. They are a broad vocational qualification requiring students at the\nAdvanced level to complete eight mandatory and four optional units of the specialist\nsubject, and three 'key skills' units of Communication, Application of Number and\nInformation Technology. Successful completion of an Advanced GNVQ, which takes two\nyears, is equivalent to two passes at A level and is a recognized qualification for entry into\nuniversity. Foundation and Intermediate GNVQs are also available. These require the\ncompletion of fewer mandatory and optional units but still contain the compulsory three\nkey skills units.\nKey skills have a fundamental role in the qualification but are not usually taught as\nseparate subjects; they are meant to be 'embedded' in vocational situations to appear more\nrelevant to the learner (Spours, 1997). Studies of the delivery of key skills in practice,\nhowever, reveal a great deal of variation in the approach taken by schools and colleges,\nwith some favouring embedding but others adopting stand-alone strategies\n(FEU\/IOE\/Nuffield, 1994). The embedded approach has been criticized by the UK\nschools' inspectorate (OFSTED) for not allowing the systematic development of\nmathematical and language skills and thus providing very few examples of good work\n(OFSTED, 1994). This approach also contrasts with the stand-alone delivery practices of\nEuropean vocational systems, which provide greater levels of attainment in key skills areas\n(Green and Steedman, 1993; Wolf, 1995).\nA further distinguishing characteristic of the new vocational qualification is its emphasis\non independent learning through portfolio compilation. Students gain the award through\nproducing a portfolio of evidence which demonstrates they have fulfilled the performance\n90\nAlt-] Volume 8 Number 3\ncriteria laid out for all of the units. The need for the students to plan their own work and\nsearch for relevant information has led to a collaborative and active style of learning\nrecognized in inspection reports as the greatest strength of the new award (FEFQ1994;\nOFSTED, 1994). It is, however, the failure of students to finish their portfolio that is the\nmajor factor in the poor completion rates of GNVQ programmes (Spours, 1997). Students\nfind themselves embroiled in matching the contents of their portfolio with the complex\ndemands of the many performance criteria required for each unit. Spours (1997) suggests\nthat this concentration on the 'administration' of their learning has adversely affected\nfundamental skill development and theoretical understanding amongst GNVQ students\nand has contributed to the halting of GNVQ provision in some further education colleges\nin favour of the traditional BTEC vocational awards.\nThe research project: introduction\nTwo of the defining characteristics of the new vocational qualifications, namely the\ninclusion of embedded key skills and the emphasis on independent and active learning, are\nseen as critical in the provision of a broad education leading either to further training\nwithin employment or to further and higher education (NCVQ, 1995). The interaction of\nthese two features of practice is also one of the major concerns of our research project.\nWorking within the context of the Advanced GNVQ Science course we have been\nprompted to ask whether an educational model which requires students to take\nresponsibility for their own learning and which embeds key skills in a vocational context is\nlikely to equip students with the key skills necessary for further training, education or\nwork. We shall attempt to answer this question in this paper by describing our research\nproject and the findings related to students' approaches to converting between units of\nmeasurement in science. The aims of our work were:\n\u2022 to characterize the mathematical competencies of vocational science students on entry\nto the GNVQ (Advanced) Science course;\n\u2022 to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the GNVQ approach to\nmathematics;\n\u2022 to investigate the role of computer-based activities in the development of mathematical\ncompetencies of vocational science students.\nWe had anticipated that the mathematical background of GNVQ students would be weak\nand we conjectured that the use of computer-based activities might support students in\ndeveloping some of the mathematical skills essential to science learning.\nMethods\nThe methodology incorporated several strands. The mathematical competencies and\npractices of twenty-one Advanced GNVQ Science students from two further education\ncolleges were first characterized through a diagnostic test. (This test has also been\nadministered to a further sixty-seven vocational science students in five other colleges in\nEngland.) We carried out extensive classroom observations during the vocational course\nand conducted a series of interviews with students on observations of science, such as the\nmathematical aspects of their assignments. The students from our two participating\n91\nAnne Butterfield et al Learning conversions in science: the case of vocational students in the UK\ncolleges then engaged in a set of computer (spreadsheet)-based activities, designed to teach\naspects of mathematics for science. Follow-up interviews and a repeat of the diagnostic test\nwere also conducted after the students had completed the spreadsheet work. The\nmathematical areas investigated were: 'Conversions' (converting between units of\nmeasurement) and 'Graphs' (fitting data to straight line graphs). In this paper we focus on\nour findings from the 'Conversions' study.\nConversions are an integral part of much scientific practice, for example to allow for ease\nof data processing, to enable comparison and standardization and to support the\nunderstanding of physical quantities and processes (Molyneux and Sutherland, 1996). It is\ntherefore crucial for science students to become competent in converting between units.\nFor this reason, the area of 'Conversions' was selected as a research topic. Analysis of the\ninitial diagnostic test administered to seventy-nine students showed that:\n\u2022 vocational science students used a range of informal methods to solve conversion\nproblems;\n\u2022 the majority of students were successful at converting between 'simple' metric\nquantities such as from grams to kilograms and from millilitres to litres (and vice\nversa);\n\u2022 no student could convert between centimetres squared and metres squared;\n\u2022 the majority of students were unsuccessful at converting quantities expressed in\nstandard form or in units with indices;\n\u2022 the diversity and informality of students converting methods on simple problems (e.g.\ncm -> m) meant it was unlikely they would develop more generalized understandings of\nconverting which may have supported them in complex converting problems (such as\ncm2 -> m2).\nThese findings influenced the design of the 'Conversions' spreadsheet activities, which\naimed to support students in learning to convert between units of measurement and to\nconstruct a formal general conversion relationship. Students worked through three\n'teaching scenarios' in consecutive weeks, with each scenario lasting one and a half hours.\nIn Scenario 1 the students worked in pairs to solve four conversion tasks presented as\nspreadsheet activities. The activities were designed to develop spreadsheet skills as well as\noffer a tool towards development of more formal converting strategies. Scenario 2 was less\nprescriptive and asked the students to use the spreadsheet to support the determination of\nthe density of different cubes of material; they were provided with materials, rulers and\nweighing scales and had to present density calculations in the units of kgnr3 although they\nhad measured mass in grams and length in centimetres. Scenario 3 consisted of three\npencil-and-paper activities designed to develop further students' understanding of\nconversions.\nAs the students worked through the spreadsheet' activities of Scenarios 1 and 2 and the\npaper-based exercises of Scenario 3, we recorded their conversations and problem-solving\nstrategies by video-recording one pair of students, audio-recording a second pair of\nstudents and taking detailed observation notes of a third pair of students. The spreadsheet\nwork of all the students was also saved to disk and all written responses on the students'\nworksheets gathered in at the end of each scenario. Whilst one or two members of the\n92\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nresearch team acted as researchers one member took on the role of teacher, being available\nto respond to students' requests for help and to intervene when they deemed appropriate.\nThis paper describes student responses to the last of four spreadsheet activities presented\nin Scenario 1. This task was designed to present students with one method of working\nwhich would provide them with information for use in the solution to a second part of the\ntask. This corresponds to Vygotsky's 'functional method of double stimulation' in which\nan individual is faced with a task beyond his or her present capabilities and then given\nadditional ('auxiliary') stimuli to incorporate into their problem-solving (Vygotsky, 1978).\nA micro-analysis of two students, Heidi and Ruth, at work is described and discussed,\nfollowed by a summary and discussion of the range of strategies used by all students\nduring this activity. Finally, we attempt to draw inferences from this analysis with regard to\nthe role of teacher and computer in the students' acquisition of appropriate formal rules.\nCase study: Heidi and Ruth converting between simple metric units\nIntroduction\nIn the following sections we present the case of two students solving a conversion problem\nusing a spreadsheet. We describe their activity before discussing the implications of this on\ntheir learning.\nMethod A Find the cross-sectional areas of a collection of wires in m2.The diameters are shown below.\ndiameter (mm)\n0.27\n1.106\n7E-2\n8.3E-I\n13.45\nradius (mm)\n0.135\nradius (m) x-sectional area (m2)\ncross-sectional area of a wire = rcr2 V = radius of the wire\nMethod B.

In method A, for given diameter of wire (in mm), students needed to divide by 2 (to\ngive radius in mm); convert from radius in mm to radius in metres (-^ 1000), then use this\nvalue to calculate the area of the wire (KI2). In method B, students first calculate area in\nmm2 and must then convert to m2. Comparing the cross-sectional areas obtained from the\ntwo methods was intended to provoke the students into realizing that to convert from mm2\nto m2 requires a division of 10002. We had assumed (from the analysis of the initial\ndiagnostic test) that Method A would pose few problems but that to convert from mm2 to\nm2 in Method B would be difficult for the students. We predicted that students would\ndivide by 1000 instead of 10002 when converting from mm2 to m2 in Method B and that by\ncomparing the results with those of Method A would work out that the conversion from\nmm2 to m2 required in Method B is a division of 10002.\nIn terms of the Vygotskian idea of the zone of proximal development, the conversion from\nmm2 to m2 in the final step of Method B was the task we considered to be beyond the\nstudents' present capabilities. The expected correct values for 'cross-sectional area (m2)' in\nMethod A were intended to provide the additional stimuli for students to solve the final\nconversion step in Method B. As we will describe however, this process was not so simple in\npractice.\nHeidi and Ruth's work, Method A\nUsing the first method, Heidi and Ruth enter the five diameters correctly into column A of\nthe spreadsheet. They next obtain a correct set of radii (mm) in column B by entering the\nformulae =A2\/2, =A3\/2 etc. into cells B2 to B6 (Figure 2). When converting the radius of\n0.135mm into metres, in cell C2, Heidi and Ruth type in an incorrect formula of B2*1000\n(instead of the correct B2\/1000). That is, they convert from millimetres to metres by\nmultiplying by 1000 instead of dividing by 1000. When the incorrect value of 135 (rather\nthan the correct value of 0.000135) appears in cell C2 as the radius (m), Ruth knows that\nsomething is wrong. Their spreadsheet at this point appears as shown in Figure 2.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nA\ndiameter (mm)\n0.27\n1.106\n7.00E-02\n8.30E-0I\n13.45\nB\nradius (mm)\n0.135\n0.553\n0.035\n0.415\n6.725\nC\nradius (m)\n135\nBgure 2: Ruth and Heidi's spreadsheet after correctly converting from diameter (mm) to radius (mm)\nbut mistakenly converting the radius ofO. 135mm to a radius of 135m.\nRuth (R), sensing that the value of 135 is not correct, discusses with Heidi (H) what they\nshould do about this.\nR: A hundred and thirty five metres? (Looking at the answer in cell C2).\nH: You're out by a point, aren't you?\n94\nAlt-] Volume 8 Number 3\nHeidi's response reflects a view, uncovered during student interviews, that converting\nbetween metric units involves moving the decimal point backwards or forwards (but with\nno conviction about which way this should be).\nR: How can it be a hundred and thirty five metres? Times by a thousand? [Looking at\nthe formula =B2*1000 in the formula bar]. Nought point one three five\nmillimetres by what?\nHeidi then offers that perhaps it is times by a 100 instead of 1000.\nH: Yeah, it's times, times, it's times a hundred.\nHeidi then works out the conversion on her calculator to help her think through the\nproblem. The students often use the calculator in this way.\nAt this point the teacher\/researcher intervenes:\nInt: What were you checking on the calculator?\nR: That! [Pointing at the 135 in cell C2]. 'Cos that ain't right.\nInt: How do you know it's not right?\nR: It can't be a hundred and thirty five metres from that.\n[Pointing at 0.135 in cell B2].\nNo chance. No chance of that, I'll try a hundred.\nRuth is obviously convinced that their answer is wrong but her strategy for debugging is to\nchange to a multiple of 100 instead of 1000. When they carry out an incorrect conversion\nRuth often knows if it is wrong, indicating some sense of appropriate values. At this stage,\nhowever, they both use a 'trial and error' technique to find the correct conversion. They do\nnot have any other type of knowledge which will allow them to decide whether to\n'multiply' or 'divide'. Ruth replaces the formula of B2*1000 in cell C2 with a new but still\nincorrect formula of B2*100. She has recognized 135 as being too large and has agreed\nwith Heidi that the solution may be to multiply 0.135 by a hundred instead of by a\nthousand. The (still incorrect) answer of 13.5 appears in cell C2.\nR: That works!\nH: Yeah, we'll have that.\nR: We can live with that.\nAgain we intervene:\nInt: How do you know that's right?\nR: 'Cos it looks right.\nInt: Have you any way of checking?\nR: Not on the computer, no.\nInt: So you reckon that point one three five millimetres is thirteen point five metres?\nHow big's thirteen point five metres?\nR: Something's wrong here.\nInt: Show me how big you think point one of a millimetre is.\nR: Cor blimey. It's minuscule innit?\nH: Yeah. Tinee!\nThis intervention has convinced Ruth that their answer is still incorrect and she then\n95\nAnne Butteifeld et al Learning conversions in science: the case of vocational students in the UK\ndecides to try multiplying by 10 instead of 100. Her strategy seems to be 'decide if a\nconversion is too big or too small then adjust accordingly by decreasing the factor', that is,\n'to make it smaller, multiply by a smaller number'.\nRuth changes the spreadsheet formula in the formula bar from B2*100 to B2*10. When the\nstill incorrect answer of 1.35 appears in cell C2 the conversation proceeds as follows:\nR: That still doesn't seem right. Nought point one three five millimetres, would b e . . .\nwhat would it be, what would it be, what would it be, what would it be? [scratching\nher head in concentration]. It would beeee . . .

That's\n[pointing with her pencil between the 3 and 5 of 0.135 in cell B2] tocentimetres\nand that [pointing with her pencil to the end of 0.135 in cell B2] would be to\nmetres 'cos you're moving the decimal point aren't you? So it is thirteen point five.\nRuth is still convinced that their conversion is incorrect. It is important to note that both\nstudents are repeatedly, and thoughtfully, considering whether their answers are sensible or\nnot.\nR: It can't be. [Adamantly and correctly]\nH: No, but we had a hundred and thirty five, didn't we?\nR: Yeah, but thirteen point five isn't right, either. How can point one three five be\nthirteen point five? Think about it, yeh? [Starts to write down the workings at the\nside of the table (Figure 1) on the worksheet. Mumbles the workings out loud as\nshe does this]. Ten millimetres equals one centimetre . . . We're dealing with less\nthan a millimetre...\nH: Exactly.\nRuth continues to write and draw on the provided worksheet, using a form of 'unitary'\nmethod to work out the conversion, combined with a qualitative approach involving order\nof magnitude. Her completed drawing, which she uses as she talks through the problem, is\nshown in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Ruth's unitary drawing as an aid to\nvisualizing the problem.\n96\nAlt-] Volume 8 Number 3\nR: We're dealing with like nought point one . . .

That then is nought point nought one centimetres. Right?\n[pointing at the circled mm line on their drawing on the worksheet].\nR: Yeh. So what would nought point nought one centimetres (0.01cm) be in metres?\nH: You move the decimal point. . .\nR: 'Cos fifty centimetres is nought point five . . . ten centimetres is nought point one\n. . . so one centimetre (lcm) would be nought point. . . nought... one of a metre\n(0.01m) [writes this down on worksheet as she speaks through it].\nR: And what we're dealing with is less than a centimetre. [Pause] So that's point\nnought one millimetres [pointing at the 0.135 in cell B2 but reading it out wrongly]\n. . . we're dealing with less than a metre, so it can't be that can it? [pointing at the\n1.35 in cell C2] So it can't be times, it'll have to be divide. Let's try that.\nRuth has convinced herself that it should be 'divide' instead of 'multiply' (correctly).\nHeidi's response is,\nH: Divide it by what?\nThey begin to negotiate whether the dividing factor is 1000 or 100.\nR: Let's divide it by a hundred for a start. . . see how we go.\nThis is done and the still incorrect answer of 0.00135 appears in cell C2. At this point they\nhave not realized that the correct division is by 1000 and not by 100. Through her\ndiscussion with Heidi, Ruth realizes that the division is by 1000.\nR: That works!\nH: That'll do [chuckles].\nR: What? [asking what H is laughing at] That looks more reasonable at least. But why\nhave we divided it by a hundred?\nH: Is it a hundred or a thousand now?\nR: What have you done... when you convert centimetres to metres... you divide it by...?\nH: A hundred.\nR: Yeh, so why have we got a hundred, it should be a thousand. I'll put the other\nnought in.\nRuth changes the formula in the formula bar from B2\/100 to B2\/1000. The correct answer\nof 0.000135 appears at last in cell C2.\nR: Right. That works [coolly].\nH: Yeh.\nR: Right. Now we've solved the problem [both laugh].\nThe students then correctly copy down the formula in the remaining cells of column C of\nthe spreadsheet to obtain a correct set of radii in metres (see column C in Figure 4 below).\nTo begin converting the values in column C to the cross-sectional areas in m2 required in\ncolumn D, the students correctly enter the formula =3.141*C2*C2 into cell D2 to obtain\nthe correct answer of 5.72477E-08. They copy down the relative formula correctly from cell\nD2 into the remaining cells of column D to complete the exercise successfully.\n97\nAnne Butterfield et o\/ Learning conversions in science: the case of vocational students in the UK\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nA\ndiameter (mm)\n0.27\n1.106\n7.00E-02\n8.30E-0I\n13.45\nB\nradius (mm)\n0.135\n0.553\n0.035\n0.415\n6.725\nC\nradius (m)\n0.000135\n0.000553\n0.000035\n0.000415\n0.006725\nD\nx-sectional area (m2)\n5.72447E-08\n9.60546E-07\n3.84773E-09\n5.40959E-07\n0.000142054\nFigure 4: Heidi and Ruth's successful completion of Method A.\nHeidi and Ruth's work, Method B\nHaving correctly completed Method A, Heidi and Ruth continue with the second method\n(Method B) presented in the question. They begin by entering the diameter (mm) values\ncorrectly in column A and then typing in the radii (mm) in column B by copying the values\nobtained in Method A (Figure 5).

At this point they appear to have\nexhausted their checking mechanisms and do not know how to resolve the problem of the\ndifferent powers:\nR: There! They're all all right. Let's just save it.\nThe spreadsheet session draws to a close and they do not resolve the discrepancy between\nthe values for cross-sectional area (m2) produced by the two methods.\nDiscussion\nHeidi and Ruth encountered no problems in Method A when converting diameter into\nradius. Nor did they have any difficulty in using 7tr2 to obtain the cross-sectional area in m2\nonce they had finally obtained the radius in metres. It is therefore likely that these students\nare competent in using formulae such as Tir2 in calculations where the units required at the\nconclusion of the task are produced by the calculation itself. (In this case, substituting a\nradius already in metres into rcr2 automatically gives a cross-sectional area in the required\nunits of m2). It is also clear that Heidi and Ruth knew and could apply the fact that radius\nis equal to half the diameter.\nWe conclude, however, judging from the time-consuming technique adopted by Heidi and\nRuth in Method A to convert the radius from millimetres to metres, that they did not\nknow, or could not remember in this context, that the general rule for converting from\nmillimetres to metres is to divide by a thousand. Without recourse to this general rule,\narriving at the correct conversion factor and its operation proved to be a great problem for\n\u2014\nAnne Butterfield et al Learning conversions in science: the case of vocational students in the UK\nthem; to convert the radius of 0.135mm to metres they tried five different operations, (1)\nxlOOO; (2) xlOO; (3) xlO; (4) +100 and, finally, (5) +1000.\nThe case of Heidi and Ruth illustrates the inefficient strategies used by many of the science\nstudents who did not have access to a 'general' approach to everyday science conversion\nproblems. Without a general rule to solve the problem, Heidi and Ruth tackled the\nconversion from millimetres to metres as if it were an investigation. Having no thorough\nknowledge of the correct conversion strategy they used a 'trial and refinement' process of\nsuccessively reducing the conversion factor, relying on a qualitative sense of whether to\naccept it or not. The trial and refinment method is grossly inefficient when compared with\nthe immediate use of a general rule. This case does illustrate however students' ability to\ndraw upon their own resources in problem-solving when more formal resources are weakly\nunderstood or have never been learned. For example, Ruth created a visual image (see\nFigure 3) to support her work on the problem.\nAfter the laborious construction of the correct method (dividing by a thousand) to convert\nfrom millimetres to metres in Method A, Heidi and Ruth did not embark on a similar\nprocess to derive the appropriate general rule for the conversion between mm2 and m2 in\nMethod B. Instead of dividing by 10002 as required, Heidi and Ruth multiplyied the cross-\nsectional area (mm2) by 1000 to obtain the cross-sectional area (m2) (see Figure 5). The\nstudents noticed immediately that the set of values for the cross-sectional area (m2) differed\nin Method B (Figure 5) from those of Method A (Figure 4). Knowing that they should\nhave been the same, Heidi and Ruth reformatted the values in Method B into standard\nform (Figure 6), which, when compared with the results from Method A clearly show that\nMethod B's results were too great (by a magnitude of lxlO9). The students indicate from\ntheir conversation that they recognize a discrepancy in the 'powers' but are not able to\n'unpack' the reason for this discrepancy. For these two students the nature of the\nspreadsheet-based task did not provide sufficient resources for them to 'work out' that\nconverting from mm2 to m2 requires a division of 10002. The correct values in Method A\ndid not provoke them to recognize the general rule for converting between mm2 and m2,\nalmost certainly because the intended confrontational situation had become too complex\ndue to the students' error of multiplying the cross-sectional area (mm2) by 1000.\nThe repeated use of multiplication to convert from millimetres to metres is probably based\non a knowledge that as metres are 'bigger' than millimetres , the correct operation is to\nmultiply in order to obtain a 'bigger'value.\nThe intervention from the teacher\/researcher when Heidi and Ruth were working on\nMethod A seems to have been critical in provoking them to reconsider their work and\nwithout this intervention they may not have successfully completed this part of the\nproblem. With respect to Method B it is also possible that an appropriate intervention\nwould have helped them to move forward.\nThe range of strategies used by the whole group\nThrough analysis of the whole cohorts' spreadsheet work, we have been able to distil\nstudent responses to the conversion task into three distinct categories, 1, 2 and 3. Data\nfrom 18 students (9 pairs) that we observed in the two participating colleges, 6 pairs from\nCollege A and 3 pairs from College B, has been drawn upon to distinguish those cases in\nwhich the intended problem-solving scenario was accessed by students successfully or not!\n100\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nResponse Category I, problem-solving scenario established\nStudents in this category completed correctly the three conversion steps in Method A to\nobtain the correct value for 'x-sectional area (m2)' in the final column. They also completed\ncorrectly the first two conversion steps in Method B but made an error-in the final step\nwhen converting from 'x-sectional area (mm2)' to 'x-sectional area (m2)'. The situation we\nhad intended to provoke was therefore established, as the students were left to resolve the\ndifference between two sets of results for 'x-sectional area (m2)', one correct (Method A)\nand one incorrect (Method B). The values for 'x-sectional area (m2)' should, of course,\nhave been the same in both methods.\nFive pairs (ten students) fell into this category. Instead of dividing correctly by 10002 in the\nfinal step of Method B, four pairs converted area in mm2 into m2 by dividing by 1000 (as\nwe had predicted) whilst one pair multiplied by 1000 (Heidi and Ruth, discussed above). Of\nthese, three pairs were able to correct their final calculation in Method B but two pairs were\nnot. The three pairs who solved the problem (all of whom had initially divided by 1000\ninstead of by 10002) received teacher intervention at the point of observing the two\ndifferent sets of answers in the final column of Method A and Method B. The two pairs\nwho were unable to correct their answers did not receive any teacher intervention at this\npoint.\nIntervention was typically in the form of the teacher\/researcher prompting the students to\nnotice 'how big' the difference was between the numbers. The successful student pairs were\nthen able to see that Method B's answers for 'x-sectional area (m2)' were too large by a\nmagnitude of 1000 (see Figure 7).\nA\nMethod A\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n9\n10\nII\n12\n13\n14\ndiameter (mm)\n0.27\n1.106\n7.00E-02\n8.30E-0I\n13.45\nMethod 8\ndiameter (mm)\n0.27\n1.106\n7.00E-02\n8.30E-0I \u2022\n13.45\nB\nradius (mm)\n0.135\n0.553\n0.035\n0.415\n6.725\nRadius (mm)\n0.135\n0.553\n0.035\n0.415\n6.725\nC\nradius (m)\n0.000135\n0.000553\n0.000035\n0.000415\n0.006725\nx-sectional area mm2)\n0.057244725\n0.960546069\n0.003847725\n0.540958725\n142.0536881\nD\nx-sectional area (m2)\n5.72447E-08\n9.60546E-07\n3.84773E-09\n5.40959E-07\n0.000142054\nx-sectional area (m2)\n5.72447E-05\n9.60546E-04\n3.84773E-06\n5.40959E-O4\n0.142054\nFigure 7: Values of cross-sectional area which are correct for method A and incorrect for Method 8.

The confrontation we had intended was therefore not established\nbecause although students were left to compare two sets of different values for 'x-sectional\narea (m2)', both sets were incorrect. Thus it was not possible to intervene in the same way\nas for those students in Reponse category 1. None of the three pairs (six students) of\nstudents who fell into this category successfully completed the task.\nResponse Category 3, problem-solving scenario redundant\nOnly one pair of students, Monica and Bev, fell into this category by completing all the\nconversion steps in Method A and Method B correctly. These two students were able to\nutilize prior knowledge and use the correct conversion factor of -HIOOO2 in the final step of\nMethod B without teacher intervention or recourse to Method A's correct values for 'x-\nsectional area (m2)'.\nDiscussion\nIt seems that where the problem-solving situation was established as we had intended\n(Response Category 1), the spreadsheet-based task supported the students in learning a\npreviously unknown general rule but required researcher intervention in addition to\nspreadsheet feedback. Thus, although the correct values for cross-sectional area (m2) in\nMethod A served as the auxiliary stimulus necessary to solve the final step of Method B (in\naccordance with Vygotsky's functional method of double stimulation) the students were\nnot able to respond to this additional stimulus without assistance from a more\nknowledgeable other.\nOut of nine pairs of students, six pairs were aware of the general rule to convert from\nmillimetres to metres; one pair (Heidi and Ruth) possessed the common sense knowledge\nto 'discover' the general rule anew, and two pairs did not have access to sufficient resources\n(computer or otherwise) to construct it for themselves.\nVygotsky (1978) proposed that in any domain each child has an 'actual developmental level'\n(determined by the individual problem-solving) and an immediate potential for development\n(determined by the problem-solving process under guidance). In some sense, the distance\nbetween the two levels is the 'zone of proximal development'. The extent to which individuals\nare able to use auxiliary stimuli as a 'sign' pointing to a problem's solution can act as an\nindicator of their 'zone of proximal development'. We designed the spreadsheet activities\nbased on an analysis of classroom observations, written test data and students' interviews in\nan attempt to ensure we were starting from the perspective of the students. Our analysis\nsuggests that the activity we had designed was within the zone of proximal development of\nonly six pairs of students - the five pairs belonging to Response Category 1 and the single\npair belonging to Response Category 3. The task's design was, however, outside the zone of\nproximal development of the six students in Response Category 2, who knew few general\nrules and could not resort to alternative strategies to construct appropriate ones.\nConclusions\nIn line with the GNVQ philosophy of independent learning, the spreadsheet tasks were\ndesigned with the intention that students would learn mathematical ideas essential to\n102\nAlt-J Volume 8 Number 3\nscience. Our premiss was that students would work with minimal intervention from a\nteacher. However through the analysis presented here, we have become aware of the\ndifficulties faced by these science students when attempting to solve mathematical\nproblems. We were overly reliant on student discussion, computer feedback and the nature\nof the activities themselves. The case of Heidi and Ruth illustrates how inefficient student\nstrategies can be during independent work supported by too little background knowledge;\nstudents must work much harder if they have not formalized common operational\nprocedures. We still conjecture that an appropriately designed spreadsheet conversion\nactivity, which allowed for more teacher direction and emphasis on a general method for\nconverting between units, could offer students a basis for developing an understanding of\nthe power of the general conversion relationship.\nThe results of this study are beginning to suggest that the practice of teaching key skills\nwithin the vocational context is not likely to redress the generally weak understanding of\nmathematics demonstrated by vocational sience students. We feel that, although\nindependent learning is a central tenet of the new vocational award, it does, in fact,\ncontribute to the difficulties reported (NCVQ, 1995) in teaching and assessing key skills in\nan effective way. Our findings which suggest that students need guidance from a teacher\nwhen working within their zone of proximal development support this view. It is also\ninevitable, as we have found, that some vocational science students with insufficient\nbackground knowledge will be working well outside their zones of proximal development\nin the mathematical aspects of their course. These students, in particular, are likely to have\ngreat difficulties grasping mathematical principles through independent learning in the\nvocational context.\nIt is evident that a way has to be found to empower vocational science students with more\nefficient mathematical strategies in order that they are not disadvantaged in the future in\nhigher education or in the workplace. We have seen that students actively think through\nproblems and seek solutions for themselves, endlessly making sense of their actions. The\nevidence of Heidi and Ruth suggests that students do work hard to produce a calculation\nwhich fits with their intuitive sense of what is sensible in a science situation. However, on\ntheir own they do not always have the resources to sort out the discrepancy between what\nthey produce themselves and what they sense that a calculation should actually look like.\nHere a teacher is absolutely crucial, otherwise students like Heidi and Ruth are unlikely to\ndevelop the mathematical knowledge which that very much need for their work in science.\nAcknowledgements\nWe want to acknowledge the Leverhulme Trust for funding the research project\n'Mathematics for GNVQ Science Students: The Role of Computers'.
