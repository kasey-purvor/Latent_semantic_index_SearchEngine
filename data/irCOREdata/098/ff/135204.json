Introduction \nThe voluntary sector is widely acknowledged as performing important service functions in society \nand, in particular, as \u201efilling gaps\u201f; providing services when the public and private sectors fail to \nprovide them.   One area which has seen considerable voluntary or community input has been \nrecycling and reuse within the waste sector.  Recent \u201emainstreaming\u201f of recycling services is \nclaimed by some to threaten the future of the community waste sector.  This paper reports on \nresearch in 2002 which traced how the community sector was contributing to waste services.  It \nalso examines recent developments in waste legislation and service provision, considering what \ncontemporary change in services might result.   Together, this information enables the changing \ninput of the community sector to waste services to be reviewed.   \n \nWriting in 1999, Murray traced three possible futures for the community waste sector, offering a \nframework against which to judge the empirical findings of this review.   One perspective sees \ncommunity organisations as pioneers in waste management that will be supplanted by larger \nprivate sector competitors over time (Murray, 1999: pp.65).  The second suggests that they will \nbe sub-contractors supplying the needs of large metal and paper reprocessors, that \u201care only too \npleased if there are small locally connected schemes that can provide reliable flows of recyclable \ninputs\u201d (Murray, 1999: pp.65).  Finally, the third perspective suggests that Community Waste \nProjects (CWPs) may become a significant part of the waste sector over the long term.  The latter \nis Murray\u201fs favoured interpretation, suggesting that the values of community enterprises \u201csupport \nthe small, the light-footed and the local\u201d which \u201cfit in well with household and neighbourhood \nservices [required by some types of recycling]\u201d (Murray, 1999, pp.66).    \n \nUnderlying this review is a normative question of what role the community sector should play in a \nmovement towards sustainability.   One perspective argues that Murray\u201fs pioneer and \nsubcontractor roles are sufficient, and that the market should determine which organisations   4 \ndeliver waste services over the longer term.  This approach emphasises the need for rapid, \nefficient, universal and effective changes in environmental standards over any advantages of \nservice diversity.  The alternative perspective is that the community sector offers unique \ncontributions which are not re-produced by the public and private sectors.  In common with other \nresearch on the community and voluntary sector, this perspective would suggest that, \u201ethe \nnonprofit form creates certain propensities or possibilities that encourage or allow these \norganisations to perform particular social roles \u2026. more regularly than other types of institutions, \nsuch as businesses or state agencies\u201f (Salamon et al., 2000: pp.4, quoted in Kendall, 2003: \npp.82).   This approach would suggest that the market for recycling services should be framed \nsuch that community organisations can continue to compete to carry out these roles.    \n \nThe tension between these two normative perspectives can be traced through this review.  In \nSection 2 below we examine the contribution of the community waste sector to waste services in \n2002.   Structured through research on wider community sector social impacts, the section also \npresents the views of those working in the community waste sector with respect to the nature of \nthese impacts.   In Section 3, we review recent legislation and other research which provides \nsome comparison between community and other waste service providers.   This section enables \nus to explore which normative position is being taken by the UK Government, as well as \nexamining some of the claims made about the community sector in the previous section.   We \nconclude in Section 4 by reviewing alternative policy options and their consequences for waste \nservices in the UK.    \n \n2. Services delivered by the community waste sector in 2002  \n \n2.1 Research design and method \n \nThe empirical material in this section comes from research on the nature and contribution of \n\u201ecommunity waste projects\u201f (CWPs). Community Waste Projects were defined in the research as   5 \n\u201enot-for-distributed-profit organisations concerned with the minimisation, reuse or recycling of \nwaste\u201f.The research was conducted at the University of Bradford and funded by the Economic \nand Social Research Council (Grant R000223705), with additional funding from the Shell Better \nBritain Campaign. The project investigated the social, economic, environmental and community \ninvolvement achievements of organisations such as community recycling companies, furniture \nreuse projects, paint redistribution schemes, computer refurbishment projects and community \ncomposting groups.  \n \nThe research drew on national and local surveys of CWPs, with nine in-depth case studies of \nparticular projects. The national survey comprised distribution of questionnaires to the 195 full \nmembers of the Community Recycling Network (CRN), an umbrella organisation of community \ngroups, co-operatives and not-for-profit businesses in the community waste sector. The survey \nwas designed to elicit a broad array of information covering the objectives, activities, staffing, \nvolunteer involvement and funding sources of CWPs. Local surveys of the full range of \ncommunity waste projects in six selected local authority areas were also conducted to ensure that \nthe investigation considered the scope of the community waste sector. The survey elements of \nthe research were completed in May 2002, and achieved a combined response rate of 46 \npercent. The specific objectives of responding organisations were then used to identify nine \ncontrasting CWPs for more detailed investigation. These case study investigations involved semi-\nstructured interviews with project workers, members of management committees and volunteers. \nThe detailed findings and methods (Luckin and Sharp, 2003a) of the project have already been \nreported elsewhere; the objective here is to reflect on their implications for the role of the sector \nwithin the wider waste management industry in the UK.  \n \nIn outlining findings, the discussion focuses on three areas of the original research: first, the \npaper considers what waste services are offered by the community waste sector and how these \ncontrast with the services offered by commercial or state competitors. Second, it analyses the   6 \nsector\u201fs size, growth trajectory and funding. Finally, the wider societal roles played by the sector \nare considered.  \n \n2.2 Waste services supplied by the community sector  \n \nDrawing on US experience, Salamon suggests that the not-for-profit nature of community sector \norganisations facilitates their fulfilling of particular social roles that are often neglected by the \nstate and private sectors (Salamon et al., 2000, quoted in Kendall, 2003: pp.92).  One of the cited \nroles is the provision of services in spheres of activity where markets or governments \u201efail\u201f.  \nMarket failure is seen as occurring when the market is \u201eimperfect\u201f, for example, when waste \nproducers do not meet the external costs of waste disposal.   Government \u201efailure\u201f occurs when a \ntopic is not considered of sufficient weight to influence the ballot box, and thus a social need has \nescaped the state\u201fs consideration.   Kendall suggests that \u201eeven where sectors [i.e. voluntary, \npublic and private] apparently co-exist in providing the \u201esame\u201f services, the literature predicts \ndifferences below the surface\u201f (Kendall, 2003: pp.93).  These differences might include higher \nquality delivered by the community sector, because the lack of financial incentives avoids the \nincentive to reduce costs; the existence of \u201estakeholder control\u201f; greater responsiveness to need; \nlower costs, because of the use of volunteers; and capacity to specialise due to \u201ecommunity \nembeddedness\u201f.  Kendall\u201fs description of the circumstances in which the voluntary sector delivers \nservices raises questions about what waste services are delivered by the voluntary sector, and \nwhether and how these services can be differentiated from those offered by the public or private \nsectors.    \n \nThe research showed that CWPs deliver a variety of environmental services including kerbside \nwaste collection, composting, waste education, management of Civic Amenity (CA) sites and \nschemes enabling reuse of particular elements of the waste stream such as furniture, white \ngoods, IT equipment and paint. For instance, in the latter respect, the national survey showed \nthat large numbers of projects were involved in reclamation of furniture or white goods (28 per   7 \ncent), IT equipment (20 per cent) and paint (20 per cent). Most of these services were offered \nalongside low-cost provision of the recovered and\/or refurbished items to community groups or \nlow-income families. Delivery of these services also frequently involved provision of training \nthrough the New Deal or Intermediate Labour Market schemes which cross-subsidise \nrefurbishment and repair work.  \n \nIn 2002, members of the CRN were responsible for the provision of kerbside recycling services to \nmore than 1.5 million households, or six per cent of UK households (Let\u201fs Recycle, 25 March \n2002). As 51 per cent of UK households were at the time covered by various types of kerbside \nrecycling scheme (DEFRA, 2002), CWPs were responsible for approximately one-eighth of such \nprovision. In addition, it should be noted that many local authorities run kerbside recycling on a \ncommingled collection model, whereas all studied CWPs operate source-separated schemes. \nCommingled collection schemes often result in higher contamination rates of recyclable materials \nand therefore have fewer environmental benefits, as well as a less commercially attractive end \nproduct. \n \nAll the case study projects involved in kerbside recycling or the management of CA sites reported \nhigh recycling rates for material brought to CA sites, of around 40% or more. This was explained \nas a result of various factors including the relatively high numbers of waste streams into which \nwaste brought to sites could be segregated, site design factors such as layout and signage, and \nthe employment of knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff. \n \nThere were also significant numbers of CWPs involved in the collection of kitchen and garden \nwaste, with 17 per cent of the organisations surveyed involved in composting of one or both of \nthese waste streams. However, it should be noted, in focusing on the CRN, the survey did not \naccess those CWPs most likely to compost. A separate network, the Community Composting \nNetwork had, at the time the research was undertaken, 130 members (see Luckin and Sharp, \n2003b).    8 \n \nFinally, 84 per cent of projects were involved in educational activities of some sort, with 70 per \ncent reporting this area of activity as a key or major objective. More than three quarters of those \nundertaking educational activities were working directly with schools in various ways, whether it \nbe through giving talks or, more directly, through establishing on-site recycling facilities.  \n \nIn summary, the research demonstrated that CWPs are delivering a diversity of waste services.  \nBut to what extent are these services unique to the community sector?  Table 1 draws on claims \nmade in the survey and interviews to consider how CWP service provision can be differentiated \nfrom that provided by other sectors.  \n \nAs Table 1 shows, CWPs compete with other sectors to provide the various waste services \noffered either through the provision of local authority contracts or in competition for grant funding.   \nCase study interviewees identified three main factors that facilitated CWP success in such \ncompetitions.  First, the voluntary nature of the community sector could mean that it is particularly \neffective in delivering services where the public is being asked to carry out an activity, for \nexample, to sort their waste. Second, the community sector is often able to operate at a relatively \nlow cost, and can also access streams of funding which are unavailable to other sectors. Finally, \nthe community waste sector is able to marry related needs, for example, for training and for the \nrepair of furniture, such that unrelated funding streams cross-subsidise each other. \n \n2.3 Sector size and funding \n \nIt can be estimated on the basis of the national and local surveys that the total number of \norganisations making up the community waste sector \u2013 including groups that are not members of \nnational networks \u2013 lies between 850 and 1,000 (Luckin and Sharp, 2003a). The national survey \nsuggested considerable growth within the sector in the late 1990s (see Figure 1). In practice the \nsituation may be more complex, as a one-off survey does not indicate the number of projects   9 \nestablished in earlier periods that have since ceased trading. Nevertheless, these figures do \nsuggest that at the time of the survey the sector was well established and growing.  \n \nMany CWPs have expanded the geographical scope of their operations and changed from small-\nscale localised organisations operating within one local authority district to regionally, or, in a few \nexceptional cases, nationally active bodies. However, despite this trend, the great majority of \nCWPs remain relatively small in terms of turnover and staffing levels. As Figure 2 shows, of the \n64 (77%) survey respondents that employed full-time staff, only 10 (12%) had more than 20 full-\ntime staff, and only one had more than 100 full-time staff. \n \nWith regard to income sources for the projects, Figure 3 indicates that the CWPs responding to \nthe national survey obtain their income from a diversity of sources. The most frequently cited \nsource of income was sale of materials, from which 65 per cent of responding projects were \nobtaining some of their income. Other prominent sources of funding included the Landfill Tax \nCredit Scheme, regeneration funding and local authority recycling contracts. \n \nDiversity of sources of income was also illustrated by the numbers of different categories of \nfunding accessed by individual projects. Only 14 per cent of projects were reliant on a single \nsource of income. Indeed, over two-thirds of responding projects received income from three or \nmore of the categories represented in Figure 3, with a quarter receiving income from five or more \ndifferent categories. This diversity shows that many CWPs are relatively stable in terms of \nfunding, although a minority are heavily reliant on a limited number of sources.  \n \nSurvey respondents were also asked to indicate the proportions of their income that they \nobtained from the various categories, and over 85 per cent of responding projects provided these \ndetails. In brief, 23 per cent of projects were obtaining at least 80 per cent of their income from \nwhat can be regarded as commercial operations (sales of materials, commercial contracts, local \nauthority contracts and recycling credits \u2013 all of which are commercial in the sense of rewarding   10 \nthe CWP according to the amount of \u201eproduct\u201f delivered). In other words, many CWPs are \ncompeting successfully with commercial firms in the waste management sector. The case study \ninvestigations corroborated this point, and also revealed a desire among several organisations \nrelying more on grant and project funding to increase proportions of commercially generated \nincome. However, the survey also showed that 23 per cent of responding projects were not \nobtaining any income from commercial sources.  \n \nIt should be noted, however, that the differences between income earned through contracted \nservices and grant funding are not entirely clear-cut. Grant funding does not come without strings \nattached, and recipient organisations must respond to rigorous criteria and meet challenging \ntargets, just as they would under, say, a contract to provide a local authority with recycling \nservices. One case study project manager noted that: \n \nI tend to want us to look at all [funding] as contracts, whether it\u2019s a small project \nor a big project, because we\u2019re being asked to deliver specific outputs in every \nsingle case. \n \nIn summary, the research showed that the community waste sector is relatively well established, \nwith both overall numbers of organisations in the sector and individual organisations apparently \ngrowing, and significant numbers of these exhibiting considerable financial sustainability. \n \n2.4 Non-waste related roles played by the sector \n \nAlongside service provision, voluntary sector organisations may also offer an additional \nadvantage over other sectors through co-producing other voluntary sector roles, including the \nprovision of non-waste services relating to innovation, advocacy, expressing voluntarism, \ndeveloping leaders and building communities (Kendall, 2003).   Table 2 below draws on the \nresearch to summarise the extent to which CWPs were delivering these contributions to society.   11 \nIn one of the areas discussed (community building) evidence is drawn solely from the case study \nelements of the research: in this respect, the results should be regarded as indicative.  \n \nAs Table 2 demonstrates, in addition to the waste service role, CWPs are delivering important \nbenefits through non-waste related services and in terms of advocacy, community expression and \ninnovation. These sorts of contributions are very unlikely to be made by non-voluntary sector \norganisations when delivering waste services.  \n \n2.5 Summary \n \nThis section has described a robust and diverse community waste sector. The sector delivers \nmany important waste services \u2013 for example, kerbside recycling, and the re-use of unusual \nwaste streams. Some services are uniquely delivered by the community waste sector; in relation \nto others, its community status appears to enable the sector to compete successfully with public \nand private sectors, conferring advantages due to public preferences, funding regimes and \ngreater responsiveness to consumers.  The research also indicated that the sector is relatively \nvibrant and that many CWPs are financially sustainable. Finally, it is clear that the sector is \ndelivering other benefits to society including non-waste related services, advocacy, community \nexpression and innovation functions.  \n \nOverall, the investigation can be summarised as presenting a rosy picture of the community \nwaste sector. The investigation, however, was a snapshot of the sector at a particular point in \n2002.  Moreover, the survey was one dimensional, in terms of considering only the state of the \nsector as it was considered by sector workers themselves.  Recent developments give greater \nlongitudinal understanding of the sector, as well as offering comparisons with other sectors; \ntogether, they imply a rather less certain and more complex future for CWPs. Drawing on a \ncombination of legislative documents, other research, and the trade press, these developments \nare discussed in Section 3.    12 \n \n3. Recent developments for the community waste sector  \n \n3.1 Changing nature of waste services in the UK  \n \nIn 2003-04 the UK recycled 17.7 per cent of household waste. Although this represents an \nupward trend, rates of 45-60% were achieved by some European neighbours in previous years \n(DEFRA, 2004a; Hogg and Mansell, 2002: pp.17).   Since 2000, a developing body of EU \nlegislation has forced the rapid development of new waste policies and practices in the UK \n(DETR, 2000; Strategy Unit, 2002b). The most important of these is the EU Landfill Directive \nwhich requires that the amount of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of in landfill must be \nprogressively reduced to just one third of its 1995 quantity by 2020.   In response to these \nrequirements, the UK Government has introduced a number of measures including targets for \nrecycling and a landfill tax allowance trading scheme.  As Table 3 below indicates, these new \nmeasures are likely to have a significant effect on the areas of recycling and re-use.  \n \nThe overall effect of the new instruments listed in Table 3 are that demand for recycling services \nis greater, and that the financial returns to organisations delivering them are more secure.  These \neffects result both because local authorities will buy more recycling services, and because \nmarkets for recycled goods are becoming more reliable.   At first glance, more secure returns for \nrecycling should be good for community waste projects \u2013 after all, their core business is at last to \nbe given the financial rewards that it deserves.   The irony is that greater financial returns mean \nthat recycling has become a more commercially attractive activity. Increasingly, therefore, the \ncommunity sector is competing with the private and public sector for the right to deliver these \nservices.  \n \n3.2 Impact of changes on community waste sector \n   13 \nIn the 1990s unreliable financial returns meant that if community organisations could make \nrecycling or re-use pay in a particular locality, local authorities were happy to let this occur on \ntheir patch, and many such community organisations emerged (Entwistle, 1998).   In contrast, the \nnew requirements now mean that local authorities need to provide co-ordinated and consistent \nkerbside and other recycling services throughout their districts. Potential waste service operators \nare required to submit tenders to demonstrate how their operations can meet these requirements, \nand local authorities select between tenders according to the legal concept of \u201ebest value\u201f.   \nContracts increasingly run for periods of between 20 and 25 years, and many also require single \ncompanies to provide an integrated service covering all waste management services (recycling \ncollections, CA site management, residual waste collection, street cleaning services).  \n \nThe attributes that enabled successful CWPs to develop \u2013 the ability to spot local needs, the \ncombination of different forms of finance, the provision of high quality localised services \u2013 do not \nnecessarily mean that they will be in a position to compete in legalistic tender processes.  In \nparticular, many CWPs do not have the capital or management capacity required to provide \nwaste management services, or even just recycling collections, across an entire local authority \ndistrict.  Some are unable to meet the required turnover threshold needed to tender, while EU \npublic tendering requirements eliminate others which are in receipt of capital grants from \ngovernment.  Finally, while the rules covering \u201ebest value\u201f specifically allow local authorities to \ntake account of social and economic benefits in addition to cost in developing tender \nspecifications, it is rare that authorities exercise this right (Newman, 2004: pp.10).   The \nimplications of these changes for the sector were brought home when the pioneering Avon \nFriends of the Earth went into receivership in August 2003 (Let\u201fs Recycle, 2003).   Reviewing \nrecent developments, the Programme Director of the government\u201fs Waste Implementation \nProgramme suggested in 2004 that the community sector would split into two parts: one that \ncompetes commercially for local authority contracts, and another that contributes innovations and \npasses on its skills to other sectors (The Waste Paper, 2004a).   Evidence to date is that there is \none large community service provider \u2013 ECT recycling \u2013 which has been able to compete with   14 \nprivate sector providers and currently delivers recycling services in 15 local authority areas (ECT, \n2005).   It is possible that other large community sector providers will yet emerge, probably from \nthe 10 organisations with more than 20 full time staff listed in Figure 2 above.  Otherwise, most \ncommunity sector providers can be seen as fitting into the more precarious second role. \n \nIf these institutional changes mean that kerbside and CA site provision are increasingly difficult \nfor the community waste sector, what of the recycling of unusual waste streams and composting?  \nRecent and forthcoming legislative changes mean that there is considerable uncertainty around \nthese fields of activity.  The loss of landfill tax credit scheme funding means that there is less \nmoney available for community sector innovation in this field. In addition, the lottery funded \nCommunity Recycling and Economic Development (CRED) scheme has focused quite \nspecifically on the tonnages of material recycled by community sector activity rather than the \nnature of materials recycled. Increased funding for local authority efforts to increase recycling \nmay, however, lead to funding for service provision filtering through to CWPs. Moreover, all \nCWPs will in future receive payment of recycling credits to reflect the money that their activities \nsave local authorities in disposal costs. These payments are to be made mandatory by the April \n2005 adoption of legislation in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act.    \n \nIn addition to these funding issues, legislative changes mean that waste handling is becoming \nmore closely regulated, and thus it is becoming more difficult for small community operators to \nfunction.  For example, in the field of waste electronic goods, the WEEE directive is likely to lead \nto a growth in retailer take-back schemes, increased involvement of commercial operators, and \naccreditation requirements for those CWPs that remain involved (Lets Recycle, 28 October, 2004; \nLets Recycle, 14 September, 2004; ICER, 2004).  However, the government has recognised the \npotential impact of the regulations on reuse of appliances through community sector activity, and \nthe sector will be represented on a task force that is to be established to monitor this impact (DTI \n2005). Moreover, the Furniture Reuse Network is working to develop regional Appliance Reuse \nCentres that it intends will facilitate increases in reuse under the new regulations (FRN 2004)     15 \nFinally, community groups involved in composting are subjected to animal by-products legislation \nwhich means that kitchen waste must be subject to high temperature processes, requiring \nexpensive equipment and high tonnage collections.  Smaller composting units also need to apply \nfor expensive Waste Management Licensing exemptions (Lets Recycle, 5\nth October 2004).  Of \nthe \u201eunusual\u201f waste streams discussed in section 2.2, only furniture re-use remains relatively \nunaffected by these changes.  Overall the combination of threats to funding streams and changes \nto regulations, means that many CWPs involved in composting or reuse of waste streams such \nas paint or WEEE will have to tailor their activities to the new situation, which may be a serious \nchallenge for some. \n \nA final area for consideration is waste education; this is an area which is particularly important for \nwaste services which require an investment of effort from the public, for example, when people \nare being asked to sort their waste.  In 2002, our research found that most CWPs were delivering \nwaste education in a way that was integrated with their waste services, and interviewees argued \nthat the public was more responsive to their messages than those from private or public \noperators.  This claim has some support from environmental psychology research which \nhighlights how recipients are much more likely to act on a message if they perceive the source \norganisation as credible and trustworthy (Kempton et al., 1992).    It could also be argued that \nlocally based community or public providers will have more long term interest in the waste \nbehaviour of the local population than \u201evisiting\u201f private sector operators.    \n \nSince 2004 the Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has developed a new nationwide \ncampaign on waste \u2013 Recycle Now \u2013 which includes a national television advertising campaign \npromoting recycling (Recycle Now, 2005).  In addition, the spread of kerbside recycling means \nthat more people are subject to specific local messages relating to their local schemes.  Against \nthis, the arguments above suggest that where a CWP kerbside service has given way to \ncommercial operators, there may be less incentive for provision of waste education.  However, in \nsome locations specific requirements for waste education may be specified within the tender   16 \ndocument, or split off and offered as a sub-contract.  Such sub-contracting may be effective if the \neducation and delivery are linked through a joint commitment to service review and improvement; \nbut less so if the two services operate at arms length.    \n \n3.3 Data on kerbside and CA site provision \n \nAt the time the research reported in section 2 was undertaken, CWPs were providing kerbside \ncollections to 6% of UK households, accounting for approximately one-eighth of all such \nprovision. Moreover, interviewees suggested that the community sector offered a superior service \nto the public or private sector because, first, they used source separated methods which \nproduced a better quality recyclate and, second, they were able to achieve higher participation \nrates.   Similarly, the research reported in Section 3 showed that 15 of the 83 (18%) respondents \nto the national survey were involved in the management of CA sites, and that they all reported \nrelatively high recycling rates at these sites.  Recent surveys provide some empirical information \nto contextualise these claims.  \n \nA survey of local authorities\u201f kerbside collection services conducted by Friends of the Earth in \n2003-4 (FoE, 2004) validates the claim that CWPs are a significant player in delivering kerbside \ncollections services across Britain, finding that 15% of Councils in England and Wales have \nkerbside collections that are completely or mainly delivered by a not-for-profit provider (see Table \n4). Second, while the FoE survey validates the claim that the vast majority (51 of 54 services \nprovided, or 94%) of collections delivered by not-for-profit providers use source-separated \nrecycling, it also shows that many private and in-house providers deliver similar services. Of the \n138 kerbside collections delivered by private sector companies, 64% were source-separated, \nwhile 59% of in-house collections were source-separated. \n \nThe FoE survey also provides some evidence that CWPs are not the only organisations that can \ndeliver high participation in kerbside recycling schemes. In FoE\u201fs assessment of \u201eten of the best   17 \ndoorstep collections in England\u201f, participation rates of 80-90% are reported for Lichfield\u201fs in-\nhouse scheme, while the highest rate cited for a not-for-profit provider is 74% for the scheme \nprovided by ECT Recycling in Vale of the White Horse (FoE, 2004). No private sector operator is \nreported as delivering similar order participation rates.    \n \nA recent survey of practices at CA sites, the National Assessment of Civic Amenity Sites \n(Cameron-Beaumont et al. 2004), provides the average recycling rates achieved by a range of \ndifferent management structures. As Table 5 shows, the average rate achieved by the community \nsector managed sites is relatively high, especially given that it is based on sites operating in \nexclusively urban areas where less garden waste is deposited at CA sites. However, the sample \nsize for community sector sites was only two, the results were not found to be statistically \nsignificant (Cameron-Beaumont et al. 2004, p.139) and a slightly higher average was in any case \nachieved by small\/ regional companies managing sites directly. \n \nMoreover, the data also showed that high recycling rates can be achieved at CA sites managed \nby organisations other than community waste projects. Indeed, the individual case studies \npresented by Cameron-Beaumont et al. (2004, pp.142-143) show both public and private sector \noperated CA sites which achieved recycling rates of over 50%.   \n \nIn summary, the data in this section confirms some findings of section 2, showing that CWPs are \na significant albeit minority provider of kerbside and CA site services.  The most interesting \nfindings relate to the claimed advantages of CWPs in the delivery of these services.  In contrast \nto the expectation of some community sector workers, it is clear that source separated recycling \ncan and is delivered by operators of all types.  Similarly, high participation in kerbside schemes \nwas observed in schemes run by both public and community operators.   In CA sites indicative \ninformation suggests that the community sector achieves similar recycling rates to those of small \nor regional private sector operators, and higher than those managed by many local authorities or \nlarge commercial providers.  Overall, it is clear that high participation and diversion rates can be   18 \nachieved in recycling services managed by all types of organisation.   Evidence with respect to \naverage recycling rates achieved by the community sector in kerbside schemes and at CA sites is \nsparse; therefore, while community organisations may achieve slightly higher rates than other \ntypes of organisation, this remains unproven.   \n \n3.4 Summary \n \nTable 6 summarises the above discussion, showing how recent developments impact on the \nareas of waste services previously delivered by CWPs. It is clear that prospects are extremely \nuncertain in many areas of CWP provision, as a result of the direct and indirect impacts of recent \nlegislative and regulatory changes. Table 6 also reviews the effect of the changes on the overall \nquantity and quality of services in each area. While the loss of community sector provision may \nimply significant local losses of high quality services, overall, recent developments are likely to \nmean clear gains in terms of the quantity of reasonably high quality services provided.  \n \n \n4. Conclusions \n \nThe picture of the community waste sector emerging from section 3 is very different from the rosy \naccount of the sector from the \u201esnapshot\u201f survey in 2002.   A combination of regulation, \ncompetition, and changes to funding regimes appear to put the sector under considerable \npressure.   Some organisations have already gone out of business, and as previous contracts \nand grants go out of date, more are likely to do so.   In these respects the pattern described \nconforms to the \u201epioneer\u201f thesis described by Murray (1999).  However, there are three respects \nin which the disappearance of the community sector that this thesis would predict is unlikely.  \nFirst, it is clear that at least one community sector organisation is successfully competing with the \nprivate sector for the provision of recycling services.   Second, in relation to furniture, white \ngoods, as well as emerging areas of waste service provision, the community sector clearly still   19 \nhas a role to play.  Third, depending on local authority contract requirements, particular \ncommunity providers may be able to continue to offer elements of waste services in specific \nlocalities.  Overall, the future community waste sector is likely to be significantly smaller than that \ndescribed in 2002; moreover, the sector may already be splitting into two parts.  A few larger \norganisations may be able to compete for \u201emainstream\u201f local authority contracts; the majority of \nsmaller ones will deliver niche services, and may be dependent on local authority goodwill in \nterms of splitting contracts into parts, and specifying additional social and environmental benefits \nrequired.  \n \nThe latter point highlights the difficulty of applying any form of \u201efree market\u201f philosophy to the \nwaste sector.   Driven by a range of regulatory requirements, supported by funds from a range of \ngovernment sources, and dependent at the local level upon contracts written by local government \nofficials, the market for waste services is entirely constructed.  As section 3 has demonstrated, \nrecent choices made at a European, national and local level are currently having the effect of \nreducing the scope and opportunities for community providers to compete for the provision of \nwaste services.   More small non-integrated contracts and more recognition of wider social and \nenvironmental benefits could slow or reverse these effects.  But should national and local \ngovernment make such moves to support the community sector?  Answers to this question relate \nto the normative tension highlighted in the Introduction.   \n \nThis paper has presented some comparisons between the public, private and community waste \nsectors.  While section 2 demonstrated that the community sector can be innovative in the \nservices it provides and the way that it provides them, it is not clear whether similar innovations \nwill emerge from the private and public sectors.   In particular, and as Section 3 has argued, the \ncommunity status of CWPs could make them more credible, and thus may make the public more \nreceptive to their messages.  Despite this prediction from theory, the sparse evidence on \nparticipation and recycling rates in kerbside and civic amenity sites is equivocal.   Overall, the   20 \npaper highlights the difficulty in achieving direct comparisons between the waste sectors without \nspecific focused research for this purpose.    \n \nOver and above the benefits arising from specific management structures, two themes have \nemerged as important features of effective recycling services.  The first theme is the ability to \ninnovate through identifying and pursuing new opportunities in terms of new waste streams or \nnew means of addressing existing waste streams.  The second theme is organisations\u201f ability to \ncommunicate effectively with the public and to stimulate their co-operation and participation in \nwaste services delivered.   The challenge for European, national and local government is to \ninfluence the necessarily constructed waste markets in a way which will enhance rather than \ndiscourage these characteristics in service providers.   Large integrated waste management \ncontracts necessarily limit the number of organisations able to tender, restricting the room for \ninnovation, and the space for detailed understanding of local needs and preferences to inform \ncommunication methods.  Contracts which are split into smaller parts could allow a range of \norganisations to present innovative ideas for service delivery, including communication methods \nand the delivery of additional social or environmental benefits.  In this respect, the same changes \nwhich may favour the community sector would also favour small private sector operators, or \nsuccessful local authority providers.  Thus, without \u201ebiasing\u201f the contracts towards community \nsector providers, such changes would ensure that innovation could be recognised and harnessed \nto maintain dynamic and flexible approaches to waste service provision in the UK.    \n \n \n   21 \n \nReferences: \n \nCameron-Beaumont, Charlotte, Eric Bridgwater and Gary Seabrook, 2004.

Often \ncoincides with provision of a waste service \u2013 \nand is thus focused on specific actions that \nenable the service to function effectively.  \na. The figure of 40% refers to the proportion of surveyed organisations that were involved in \ncollection of either white goods, IT equipment or paint. Many of these organisations collected two \nor more of these waste streams. \nb. It should be noted that the main network on which the survey was based was the CRN, the \nmost diverse of the national networks in the sector. A separate network, the Community \nComposting Network had, at the time the research was undertaken, 130 members (see Luckin \nand Sharp, 2003b).    26 \nTable 2   \nVoluntary sector contributions to well being (after Kendall, 2003: pp.93-4) \n \nArea of contribution \u2013 from Kendall  Examples of potential CWP contributions  Extent of activity observed through research \n \n(Non- Waste) Service role: Geared \ntowards areas where markets and \ngovernment \u201efail\u201f. \nDelivering non-waste services such as training to \nlong-term unemployed; provision of low cost furniture \nto low-income families; work placements for people \nwith learning disabilities.  \nTraining \u2013 more than 40% of CWPs.  \nGoods to low income families \u2013 more than 35% \nof CWPs \nInnovation Role: The community \nsector is envisaged as fulfilling in the \npublic sphere the same role as small \nbusinesses play in the private sphere.  \nInnovation in collection method and in materials \ncollected, eg Collection of unusual waste streams; \nuse of Pedestrian Controlled Vehicles (PCVs) to \ncollect recycling in densely populated areas. \nRecovery of unusual waste streams \u2013 40% of \nCWPs involved (see Table 1). \nOne case study organisation using PCV for \ncollections.  \nAdvocacy Role: Voluntary \norganisations link individuals to the \nbroader political process \n \nCWPs campaign for new or different waste policies, \ncontribute to waste networks, also lobby policy-\nmakers locally and nationally. \nMost organisations make some contribution to \nlocal governance but it is generally not a \nprimary activity. \nExpressive role: Voluntary sector \norganisations promote citizen \nparticipation, and protect interests of \nsocial, religious, cultural or other \nminority groups.  \nCWPs attract volunteers to participate in delivery of \nwaste services within their local community \n \nVolunteer involvement a key feature for many \nCWPs: 82% of projects involved volunteers, \nwith average of approx.16 volunteers per project \nLeadership development: Voluntary \ngroups encourage involvement in \ncommunity activities and enable new \ncommunity leaders to emerge. \nCommunity members may become involved in \nmanagement of CWP.  \nLimited evidence of local people contributing to \nCWP management \u2013 e.g. it is often hard to find \nlocal people to serve on management \ncommittees (Luckin and Sharp, 2004).  \nCommunity building role: The sector \ncontributes not just to diversity \nreinforcement, but to social and \npolitical integration too.  \nThe provision of low cost recycled furniture is a \ndemonstration of social solidarity, but will not \nnecessarily contribute to community-building. \nHowever, the premises of CWPs, especially those \ninvolved in re-use, may act as spaces for greater \nsocial interaction within communities.  \nProvision of furniture a key goal of many CWPs. \nHowever, limited evidence of community \nbuilding \u2013 one case study organisation reported \ncommunity links developing between trainees \nand families when collecting low-cost furniture.   27 \nTable 3 \nRecent measures to address waste policy in the UK \n \nDevelopment  Description  Probable impact \n \nRecycling \ntargets for \nlocal \nauthorities \nLocal authorities are now required to \nmeet particular targets for recycling and \ncomposting by 2010 and 2015. More \nstringent central government oversight \nof local services will result for authorities \nfailing to meet targets (DETR 2000). \nStrong regulatory incentive for \nlocal authorities to improve the \nextent of recycling in their area, \neither through purchase or \nprovision. \nLandfill tax \naccelerator \nLandfill tax currently \u00a315\/tonne but \ngovernment has indicated rise to \u00a318\/ \ntonne in 2005-6 and by \u00a33\/tonne\/year \nthereafter until \u00a335\/tonne (HM Treasury \n2002). \nThe increasing cost of landfill will \nreduce the relative costs of \nrecycling, making this a more \neconomically attractive option for \nlocal authorities and businesses. \nThe Waste and \nResources \nAction \nProgramme \n(WRAP) \nWRAP set up in 2001 to develop \nmarkets for recycled material, and has \nrecently been asked to also take on the \ngovernment\u201fs waste awareness \ncampaign (The Waste Paper, 2004b)  \nIf successful, WRAP will provide \nlarger and more stable markets for \nrecyclate, as well as greater use of \nrecycling facilities by the general \npublic. Again, recycling becomes \nmore financially viable.  \nReview of \nlandfill tax \ncredit scheme \n(implemented \n2003) \nLandfill tax credits are no longer \navailable to community recycling \nschemes, with the funding channelled \ninto municipal recycling, e.g. through \nDEFRA\u201fs Challenge Fund. New but \nsmaller CRED (Community Recycling \nand Economic Development) lottery fund \navailable to CWPs.  \nEnhanced funding for local \nauthority recycling schemes.  \nReduced access to funding for \nCWPs.  \nHousehold \nWaste \nRecycling Act \nKerbside collection of two materials \nmust be in place by 2010, although there \nmay be some flexibility in circumstances \nwhere this would be very costly, eg \nremote rural areas.  \nStrong regulatory incentive for \nLocal authorities to improve the \nextent of recycling in their area, \neither through purchase or \nprovision. \nReview of \nrecycling \ncredits  \nFinancial benefits that accrue to local \nauthorities through third party recycling \nand re-use are to be distributed to third \nparties following adoption of the Clean \nNeighbourhoods and Environment Act in \nApril 2005. \nThe activities of CWPs will be \nbetter rewarded.  \nLandfill \nAllowance \nTrading \nScheme \nIncreasingly challenging targets for \nreduction of landfilling. Greater flexibility \nthrough trading, banking and borrowing \nof allowances. Severe financial penalties \nfor failure to meet targets. \nStrong financial incentives for local \nauthorities to reduce landfilling of \nbiodegradable municipal waste.  \n   28 \nTable 4  \nOrganisations and type of recycling delivered\na  \n \n  Private sector \ncompany \nIn-house  Not for profit  Totals \nCo-mingled  \n \n50  72 \n \n3  125 \nSource separated  88  104  51  243\nb \n \n \nTotals  138  176  54  368\nc  \na.
