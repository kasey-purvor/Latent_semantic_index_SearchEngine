The recent surge in the literature on portfolio models of the current\naccount reflects these new trends in global finance.\nOne of the first that marked the recent emergence in portfolio models is the partial-equilibrium\napproach of Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003). According to their theory, international capital flows,\nor the current account, is caused by portfolio growth through changes in wealth. Countries invest the\nmarginal unit of wealth as the average unit, or in other words, portfolio shares (net foreign assets to\ntotal assets) are constant, and the current account is simply equal to the changes in wealth times the\nportfolio share.\nMost recently, the works of Devereux and Sutherland (2006 a,b,c) and Tille and Van Wincoop\n(2008) explicitly model portfolio choice for both gross and net international capital flows, taking\ninto account the general equilibrium effects of portfolio choice on external adjustment. While their\nemphasis is methodological,3 they make the important point that international capital flows in their\nframework can be broken down into a component associated with portfolio growth through savings and\na component associated with the optimal reallocation of portfolio as a result of changes in expected\nrisk and returns of various assets. Their models also incorporate valuation effects, which have been\nat the heart of empirical research on external adjustments, notably Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005),\nGourinchas and Rey (2007), and Tille (2005).\nIn this paper, the first objective is to show that most of the recent literature on the current account\n1The share of U.S. current account deficits in GDP reached an unprecedented high of 6.4% in the year of 2005 and\nremains at a high level.\n2For industrial countries, the sum of the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities relative to GDP has increased\nby a factor of 7, from 45% to 300% over the period of 1970-2004. For developing countries, it has increased from around\n40% to 150% over the same period (Lane et al 2007).\n3They develop a method for solving dynamic stochastic general equilibrium open-economy models with portfolio\nchoice that can be implemented both in a complete market setting and an incomplete market setting.\n2\ncan be nested into a non-structural, accounting framework. The accounting framework decomposes the\ncurrent account into two factors that are synonymous to the portfolio growth and portfolio reallocation\nbreakdown emphasized in the general equilibrium model of Tille and Van Wincoop (2008). We call\nthese two effects a composition effect and a growth effect. The composition effect is like a \u201dsubstitution\neffect\u201d, and refers to the reallocation of the portfolio towards or away from foreign assets. It is\nmanifested in changes to the portfolio share (share of net foreign assets in total assets). The growth\neffect is similar to an \u201dincome effect\u201d, and refers to changes in the budget set, or total wealth, that\nleads to corresponding proportional changes in both assets and liabilities. The framework can also\nincorporate valuation effects and capital gains and losses and their impact on the current account.\nThis non-structural, synthesized framework, despite its simplicity, can be very useful as a framework in\nnesting, and empirically assessing, various theories of the current account without needing to impose\nmore structure on the model.\nThis framework, along with the general equilibrium models, demonstrate the theoretical impor-\ntance of both the composition effect and the growth effect in accounting for external adjustments. Yet,\nthe Kraay and Ventura (2000) theory puts forth \u201cthe growth effect\u201d as the source of long-run current\naccount movements. Other theories of the current account, albeit not based on portfolio choice mod-\nels, such as Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa (2005), Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008), essentially\nposit that the \u201ccomposition effect\u201d is the main driver of current account movements. These three\ndifferent views of the current account naturally call for an empirical investigation on which factor, if\nnot both, is more quantitatively relevant. While there is still a dearth in the empirical assessment of\nthese portfolio choice models, the closest related empirical work is that of Kraay and Ventura (2000,\n2003). Based on their view that portfolio shares are fixed in the long run and current account changes\nare brought about by changes in wealth, they run a \u201cfixed-portfolio\u201d regression to test the theory,\nand find overwhelming support for the growth-effect theory.4 Consequentially, it appears that the\ngrowth effect is sufficient for describing the real-world dynamics of external adjustment, leaving the\ncomposition effect highlighted by general equilibrium models only as a theoretical plausibility.\nThe need for more concrete empirical assessment of these theories leads to the paper\u2019s second\nobjective, which is to use historical OECD data to empirically assess the relative importance of the\n4Kraay and Ventura (2003) shows empirically that the rule that portfolio shares are constant does not hold well in\nthe short run, but is rather a good description of the data in the long run.\n3\ncomposition effect and the growth effect. Two results emerge: first, we overturn the Kraay-Ventura\nconclusion that changes to the current account is explained by the growth effect, by theoretically\nshowing that the surprising result of their \u201cfixed-portfolio\u201d cross-country regression is the outcome\nof a \u201ccoincidence\u201d, whereby an omitted variable bias is concealed by the case of a short time series.\nFurthermore, because the initial values of net foreign assets are small relative to the subsequent flows\nin the data sample, the cross-sectional variation is generated only by an accounting approximation\nand therefore contains limited informational content. Second, we find that the portfolio share is\nconsistent with following a highly persistent process, with some countries displaying a deterministic\ntrend, directly in opposition to the earlier claims that the portfolio share is constant.\nThese findings suggest that the existing empirical work can be very misleading in ascribing the\ngrowth effect as the main explanation for international capital flows. By overturning the Kraay-\nVentura result, together with a variance decomposition of the current account, we are able to establish\nthe composition effect as the main driver of external adjustment dynamics, and that the growth effect,\nwhile theoretically plausible, is quantitatively insignificant.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we derive an accounting framework that exposits\ndifferent possible channels through which current account adjustments can occur, and nest the recent\ncurrent account literature into this framework. Section 3 gives a theoretical exposition of the problem\nof the fixed-portfolio cross-country regression results, and Section 4 undertakes the empirical analyses.\nSection 5 provides a discussion on certain theoretical implications of the synthesized framework and\nSection 6 concludes.\n2 The Framework\n2.1 Theoretical Derivation\nIn this section, we derive an accounting framework of the current account that can nest the myriad of\ndifferent views on external imbalances recently put forth in the literature. This framework, although\nnon-structural, can empirically evaluate structural models of the current account such as Kraay and\nVentura (2000, 2003), Blanchard et al (2005), and Caballero et al (2008), and nonstructural models\nsuch as Gourinchas and Rey (2007), at the same time giving certain theoretical predictions related to\nthe current account.\n4\nIn deriving the framework, we first begin with an accounting identity. Define wealth, W = K +\nNFA, where W is total wealth, K is the domestic capital stock and NFA is the net foreign asset\nposition. Define x as the share of net foreign assets in total wealth. Therefore,\nNFA = x \u00b7W (1)\nTaking a total differentiation of this equation yields the following:\n\u2206NFA = \u2206x \u00b7W + x \u00b7\u2206W (2)\nHere, \u2206NFA is the change in net foreign assets, \u2206x is the change in the portfolio share of net\nforeign assets, and \u2206W is the change in the total wealth, which we call savings (explained below). By\ndefinition, the change in net foreign assets \u2206NFA is just the current account CA. This gives us the\nfollowing equation:\nCA = \u2206x \u00b7W + x \u00b7 S (3)\nEquation 3 leads to an accounting framework that attributes the current account balance to the\nsum of two effects: the effect of a change in the portfolio share, x, what we call the \u201dcomposition\neffect\u201d, and the effect of a change in wealth, which is in our terminology the \u201dgrowth effect\u201d.5\nOn one side of the current account literature, Blanchard et al (2005), Caballero et al (2008) and\npart of Cooper (2005) argue that current account changes reflect changes in x, the composition effect.6\nAccording to equation 3, this means that CA = \u2206x \u00b7W . On another side, Kraay and Ventura (2000,\n2003), among others, argue that the U.S. current account deficit is due to a growth effect.7 Countries\n5These two effects are tantamount to the \u201dportfolio growth\u201d effect and \u201dportfolio reallocation\u201d effect in the general\nequilibrium model of Tille and Van Wincoop (2008).\n6Blanchard et al (2005) attribute the large U.S. current account deficit to exogenous shocks to asset preferences,\nin particular, a permanent increase in demand for U.S. assets. Caballero et al (2008) explain the rise in the share of\nU.S. assets in the global portfolio and the subsequent large current account deficits by the slow growth condition in\nEurope relative to the U.S. and the inability of Asian financial markets to generate sufficient financial assets to cope\nwith their good growth conditions. Cooper (2005) argues that the marginal foreign investment in the U.S. exceeds its\naverage foreign investment, and that the U.S. has investment opportunities that produce higher returns than in Japan\nand Europe. In essence, all of these papers argue that changes in portfolio composition is the main source of large current\naccount movements, albeit for different underlying reasons.\n7Bussiere, Chortareas, and Driver (2002) empirically find that in a panel of 18 OECD countries, initial portfolio alloca-\ntion affects current account behavior following temporary shocks, therefore concluding that these results are compatible\nwith the \u201dnew rule\u201d suggested by Kraay and Ventura (2000). Iurrita (2004) extends the Kraay-Ventura (2000) model to\na two-country large open-economy model, and examine the current account responses to transitory-income shocks in a\ntwo-country world.\n5\nmaintain a constant portfolio composition as the portfolio enlarges, as it is customary that countries\n\u201dinvest the marginal unit of wealth in the same way as the average unit\u201d.8 Based on the Kraay-Ventura\nclaim, a simple rule predicts the current account response to changes in wealth: it is equal to this\nconstant share of net foreign assets multiplied by the additional wealth.9 In our framework: countries\nmaintaining constant portfolio shares over time amounts to \u2206x = 0. Namely, only the growth effect\nremains: CA = x \u00b7 S.\nThe third view of the literature is represented by the general equilibrium portfolio models developed\nmost recently, such as Tille and Van Wincoop (2008), and Devereux and Sutherland (2006a,b,c). They\npoint to the theoretical importance of taking into account both the composition effect and the growth\neffect in explaining current account adjustments. The following sections take up the task of empirically\nassessing these three different portfolio views of the current account.\n2.2 Empirical Results in the Literature\nAlthough many theories of the current account from a portfolio perspective have emerged from this\nrecent wave of interest, there has been very little lucid empirical analysis on these theories. No existing\nempirical work, to our knowledge, has specifically aimed at exploring the relative importance of the\ntwo effects in explaining the current account. The most relevant empirical study to this end is the\nwork done by Kraay and Ventura (2000), which tests the validity of the growth-effect theory. To test\nthe theory that CA = x \u00b7 S, the regression10\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21(xit \u00b7 Sit) + \u03b7it (4)\n8The other dimension of Cooper (2005)\u2019s argument also encompasses the \u201dgrowth effect\u201d feature in stressing that the\nlarge U.S. current account deficit is only a natural feature of the increasingly globalized world, where a portion of the\nworld\u2019s excess saving is invested in the U.S.\n9This seemingly simple equation yields surprising implications that are absent in the standard view of the current\naccount. An increase in savings will lead to a current account deficit in debtor countries but a current account surplus\nin creditor countries. For this reason, Kraay and Ventura\u2019s explanation of the huge current account deficit in the U.S. is\nnot a reflection of shifts towards U.S. assets and away from foreign assets by foreign countries, but of the large increase\nin its wealth and of the fact that U.S. had been a debtor.\n10Kraay and Ventura (2000) confirms that the results of this regression holds even after controlling for a number\nof relevant variables and using an instrumental variable to estimate the \u03b21 coefficient. Omitted variable bias and\nmeasurement error seem not to affect much of the result, and therefore we follow Kraay and Ventura in using this\nreduced-form equation as the basis of our analysis.\n6\nis performed. CAit and Sit denote the current account and savings as a share of GNP in country i in\nyear t; xit is the share of net foreign assets in total assets; and \u03b7it is the error term.11\nAccording to the growth-effect theory, \u03b21 should be 1. Kraay and Ventura (2000) run both the\npooled regression that includes all country\/year observations of 13 OECD countries over the time\nframe of 1973-1995 and the cross-section regression that uses country-averages of all variables, i.e.\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i(upper bar of a variable denotes its average over time). They find that the\nestimated \u03b21 is 0.955 in the pooled regression and 0.996 in the cross-section regression, and cannot\nreject the null that \u03b21 is equal to 1 in either case. We re-run the cross-section regression using three\ndifferent measures of the current account, including measures that account for valuation effects, and\nfind similar results, reported in Table 1.12 \u03b21 = 1 cannot be rejected when using any of the three\nmeasures, despite the datasets\u2019 dissimilarity. Figure 1 displays the empirical result of the cross-section\nregression.\n[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]\n[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]\nWe make two important observations here. First, according to our accounting framework, \u03b21 = 1\ndoes not necessarily rule out the importance of the composition effect, nor by itself provide support\nfor the growth effect. If the composition effect is uncorrelated with the growth effect, which is not\nimplausible, we could well have \u03b21 = 1, while a significant portion of current account movements can\nstill be accounted for by the composition effect. However, the fact that the R2 in the cross-section\nregression above can be as high as 0.85 seems to suggest that the majority of the cross-sectional\nvariations of the current account is attributed to the growth effect. The composition effect, on the\nother hand, is at best marginally important.\nThe second observation is that the empirical support for the growth effect comes from primarily the\ncross-sectional variations and not in the least bit from the time-series variations. Table 2 compares the\n11Note that in running this regression, Kraay and Ventura\u2019s measure of the current account CA does not consistently\ntake into account valuation effects and capital gains. Later, we re-run the regression with our measure of current account\nCA, which include these effects.\n12First, we expand the original K-V dataset, using conventional measures of the current account, to 20 OECD countries\nover 1973-2003. Because of data availability issues and especially of the missing IIP data in the IMF\u2019s Balance of Payment\nStatistics for some countries in early years, it is an unbalanced panel. We subsequently use the change in net foreign\nassets and IIP taken from the Lane et al (2007), \u201dMark II\u201d dataset for 22 OECD countries over 1973-2003 to run the\nsame regression, also reporting the results using the Lane et al (2001), \u201dMark I\u201d dataset covering a shorter time period\nof 1973-1998 for the same set of countries, where estimates of net foreign assets is based on a different methodology from\nthe subsequent one and are therefore somewhat different.\n7\noutcome of the within regression (time-series variation within each country) and between regression\n(cross-sectional variation). Clearly, there is no evidence supporting the \u201dnew rule\u201d at the time-series\ndimension while it performs remarkably well at the cross-sectional dimension. In Kraay and Ventura\n(2003), they interpret this divergence in performance as the distinction between a short-run and a\nlong-run phenomenon. They argue that the \u201dnew rule\u201d may not hold well in the short-run possibly\nas a result of adjustment costs, but that it nevertheless holds very well in the long-run, as is evident\nfrom the cross-section regression results. For this reason, the next sections focuses exclusively on the\ncross-sectional regressions (in which the evidence lies), and show that the cross-sectional variations\nin the current account are mainly driven by an accounting approximation, so that the only piece of\nevidence that remains provides little meaningful empirical support for the \u201dnew rule\u201d.\n[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]\nAn important and equally surprising result is: when instead of running the shares regression above,\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i, where the current account is the share of GNP, and savings is taken to be\nthe savings rate, we run a levels regression, where CAit is taken to be the levels of the current account\nand Sit is taken to be total savings, the coefficient is \u03b21 now actually close to 2 (Table 3). According\nto the growth-effect theory, these two different specifications should be identical in terms of predicting\n\u03b21 = 1, with the levels regression being an even more direct way of assessing the growth-effect theory\nthan CA = x \u00b7 S. The theoretical analysis in the next section will illustrate exactly why one could\nobtain the result that \u03b21 = 2, and how it sheds light on the Kraay-Ventura result.\n[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]\n3 The Problem of the K-V Cross-Section Regression\n3.1 The Shares Regression\nWe theoretically derive the explicit expression for the \u03b21 coefficient of the cross-section specification\nfor three different data generating processes of x, for both the shares and the levels regression. We will\nshow that we can in fact obtain \u03b21 = 1 for all of the considered DGP\u2019s of x in the shares regression,\nbut that the possibility of seeing \u03b21 = 2 in the levels regression is only consistent with x following a\nhighly persistent or unit root process with some countries displaying a trend.\n8\nBy definition, the portfolio share x of country i at time T is equal to the initial net foreign asset\nposition, NFAi0, plus the sum of subsequent \u2206NFA in every period current account in each period),\ndivided by the initial total asset position, Wi0, plus the sum of savings in every subsequent period.\nThe following accounting identity follows:\nxiT =\nNFAi0 + CAi1 + CAi2 + ...+ CAiT\nWi0 + Si1 + Si2 + ...+ SiT\n(5)\nIf the initial net foreign asset position NFAi0 and assets Wi0 are quantitatively small compared to the\nincremental net foreign assets and wealth over subsequent periods, these initial values can be ignored.\nAs such, the following equation will be approximately true:\nxiT =\nNFAi0 + CAi1 + CAi2 + ...+ CAiT\nWi0 + Si1 + Si2 + ...+ SiT\n\u2248\n\u2211T\nt=1CAit\u2211T\nt=1 Sit\n=\n\u2211T\nt=1CAit\/T\u2211T\nt=1 Sit\/T\n=\nCAit\nSit\n(6)\nThe end-of-period portfolio share xiT is approximately equal to the sum of all current account\nbalances in each period divided by the sum of savings in each period. Consequently, xiT is simply\nequal to the average current account over the average savings (upper bar of a variable denotes its\naverage over time). Note that this approximation does not require a very long time series, i.e. a large\nT . The reason is that financial globalization and economic growth over the past three decades has\nserved to reduce the quantitative importance of initial net foreign asset positions and wealth compared\nto the subsequent flow variables. From our sample, which consists of the period between 1973 and\n2003, the initial assets represent on average 10% of the sum in the denominator, and the initial net\nforeign asset position represents about 5% of the total sum in the numerator. Rearranging equation 6,\nwe get\nCAit = xiT \u00b7 Sit (7)\nwhich says that the average current account of country i over the sample period is simply equal to the\nend-of-period share of net foreign assets times the average savings over the same period.\nIt should be noted that equation 7 is very similar to the cross-section regression CAit = \u03b20 +\n\u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i in Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003), albeit not identical. In the rest of this section,\nwe will show that the accounting approximation equation 7, which holds regardless of the underlying\nprocess of xit and Sit, may undermine the validity of the cross-section regression in Kraay and Ventura\n9\n(2000, 2003). In particular, we show that given the short time horizon of the period in consideration,\nthis accounting approximation may dominate the cross-section variations of the current account for a\nwide range of processes of xit, regardless of whether it\u2019s consistent or inconsistent with the \u201dnew rule\u201d.\nA caveat is, should we care about the process of Sit, or alternatively the process of Wit? In\nprinciple, yes. To see this, the regression CAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i can be rewritten as\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21\n[\nxit \u00b7 Sit + covt(xit, Sit)\n]\n+ \u03b7i,\nwhere covt(xit, Sit) is the time-series correlation between xit and Sit in country i, which shows that the\nprocess of Sit and in particular its time-series correlation with xit matters. A look at the data, however\nsuggests that this term is quantitatively negligible: the correlations between xit \u00b7Sit and xit \u00b7 Sit are as\nhigh as 0.986, 0.998 and 0.997, using the three different measures of the current account.13 Therefore,\nin this case, the key evidence supporting the K-V \u201dnew rule\u201d is essentially the following cross-section\nregression\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i (8)\nIt is plausible that there is cross-sectional correlation between xit and Sit. For instance, countries\nwhich have higher savings may also have a higher share of net foreign assets. But this would automati-\ncally invalidate Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003) as their theory suggests that x should be independent\nof S, particularly in the cross-section. Allowing for such a correlation, however, would only strengthen\nour results (below) at the cost of more intricate algebra. For expositional purposes, we will assume\nthat there is no cross-sectional correlation between xit and Sit. A technical appendix showing that all\nresults derived below carry through when relaxing this assumption is available upon request.\nWhy does the point estimate of \u03b21 = 1 of equation 8 simply reflect the accounting approximation\nCAit = xiT \u00b7 Sit? To see this intuitively, compare equation 8 and equation 6. The only difference\nbetween the accounting approximation and the regression specification is xiT and xit. But when the\ntime-series is not too long ( for example T=30, where T=30 is more than sufficient for equation 6 to\nhold), the end-of-period portfolio share xiT and the average portfolio share xit are not very different\neven in the case where xit has a deterministic trend or is non-stationary, cases which would be contrary\n13These measures correspond to the Lane el al Mark I, Mark II, and the traditional current account measures.\n10\nto the \u201dnew rule\u201d. It follows that running the cross-section regression in Kraay and Ventura (2000,\n2003) can always yield \u03b21 = 1 as seen in Table 1. While \u03b21 = 1 is certainly consistent with the \u201dnew\nrule\u201d, \u03b21 = 1 is in fact, consistent with any rule. Therefore, it cannot be taken as evidence for, or for\nthat matter against, the \u201dnew rule\u201d.\nTo be more concrete, consider the following three possible data generating processes of x:\n(a) x is stationary without trend, i.e. xit = xi + \u03b5it,\n(b) x is nonstationary with\/without trend, i.e. xit = \u03b1i + xit\u22121 + \u03b5it,\n(c) x is a trend-stationary process, i.e. xit = xi0 + \u03b1it+\n\u2211t\nj=1 \u03c1\nt\u2212j\u03b5ij ,\nwhere subscripts i and t represent country i and year t, respectively. Next we attempt to work out\nthe exact value of \u03b21 for all three cases by plugging in equation 7 into the regression.\nCase (a): The cross-sectional regression specification CAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i yields\n\u03b21 ' var(xi \u00b7 Sit)\nvar(xi \u00b7 Sit)\n= 1 (9)\nProof: See appendix.\nThe intuition is the following: if xiT = xi+\u03b5iT , it is roughly the case that xiT = xit+\u03b5iT . Namely,\nthe end-of-period portfolio share xiT is equal to the average portfolio share plus an error term. The\naccounting approximation CAit = xiT \u00b7Sit then becomes CAit = xit \u00b7Sit+\u03b5iT \u00b7Sit. Notice that \u03b5iT \u00b7Sit\nis by assumption uncorrelated across countries, and denoting it as \u03b7i, the accounting approximation\nfinally becomes CAit = xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i, precisely the cross-country \u201dregression\u201d in Kraay and Ventura\n(2000, 2003). So even if their conjecture that x is roughly constant over time is correct, these regression\nresults carry no empirical content, and consequently do not serve as a validation to the growth-effect\ntheory, or the \u201dnew rule\u201d. In fact, this case mathematically confirms the point made in Van Wincoop\n(2003), where he argues that any model that has a steady-state portfolio share can deliver \u03b21 = 1\nin the K-V regression since deviations from the steady state would cancel out when taking averages.\nGoing one step beyond this argument, in case (b) and (c), we will show that even if there were no\nsteady-state portfolio share x, the cross-section variations may still be dominated by the accounting\napproximation when T is not very long, the case of this particular data sample.\n11\nCase (b): The same regression specification yields\n\u03b21 =\nvar(xi0 \u00b7 Sit) + T+12 A+ T (T+1)2 B + C\nvar(xi0 \u00b7 Sit) + (2T+1)(T+1)6T A+ (T+1)\n2\n4 B + C\n, (10)\nwhere A = var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2), B = var(\u03b1iSit), and C =\n(T+1)\n2 cov(xi0Sit, \u03b1iSit).\nProof: See appendix.\nThe first term of both the numerator and denominator are identical and is a \u201dcross-section varia-\ntion\u201d involving the initial net foreign asset share and average savings rate. Ignoring the other terms,\n\u03b21 is just equal to 1, and this reverts back to case (a). Others terms in the numerator and denominator\nreflect deviations from case (a). The second terms differ only by a coefficient and contain the variance\nof the random-walk part of x which we call a \u201dwhite-noise variation\u201d, and their ratio is close to 1.5\nwhen T is very large. The last two terms are related to the trend: the third terms represent the \u201dtrend\nvariation\u201d and their ratio converges to 2 when T is very large. The fourth terms, which we group\nwith the cross-section variation term, are identical and their ratio is therefore 1. Consequently, \u03b21\nis a weighted average of 1, 1.5 and 2, the weights depending on the \u201dcross-section variation\u201d (terms\n1 and 4), the \u201dwhite-noise variation\u201d (term 2), the \u201dtrend variation\u201d (term 3) and time T . If the\n\u201dcross-section variation\u201d is large and T is not too large, namely, we are not far away from case (a),\nmore weight is put on 1, and we could see \u03b21 = 1. If, however, the \u201dtrend variation\u201d is large and\/or\nT is very big, we could see \u03b21 = 2. A special case is if \u03b1i = 0 for all i, the case where the portfolio\nshare x has no time trend, and the last two trend-related terms (terms 3 and 4) vanishes, so that \u03b21\nis a weighted average of 1 and 1.5.14 The key is that with a relatively short time series of 31 years\nin this data sample, it is the case that the cross-section variation dominates both the trend variation\nand the white noise variation.\nTo illustrate the order or magnitude, the sample cross-section variation is of order 10\u22124, the sample\nwhite-noise variation is of order T2 10\n\u22126, and the sample trend variation is of order T\n2\n2 10\n\u22127. Clearly,\nwith T = 31, the cross-section variance (the first term) dominates the rest of the terms. Since case\n(a) has already shown that the cross-section variation is determined by an accounting approximation,\nit is difficult to see anything but \u03b21 equal to 1 because of the relatively short time series. When in\n14\u03b21 could be close to 1 if the cross-section variation is large and T is relatively small, and close to 1.5 if the white-noise\nvariation and\/or T is very large.\n12\nthe future will we be able to see \u03b21 = 2? The answer is, only after a very long time, and we would\nalways see \u03b21 = 1 if using available data. According to the above magnitudes, with 50 years of data,\nthe coefficient will be only 1.25. With 100 years of data, the coefficient can reach 1.5. And it will take\nmore than four centuries for the coefficient to reach 1.9! The important point is that even if x follows\na nonstationary process of case (b), which is directly in opposition to the growth-effect\u2019s theory of a\nconstant portfolio, \u03b21 = 1 cannot be rejected when the \u201dcross-section variance\u201d dominates, precisely\nthe case when the time series is relatively short (T < 50).\nCase (c): The same regression specification as the above yields\n\u03b21 =\nvar(xi0 \u00b7 Sit) + E(1\u2212\u03c1\nT\ni \u2212\u03c1T+1i +\u03c12T+1i\nT (1\u2212\u03c1i)2(1+\u03c1i) ) \u00b7A+\nT (T+1)\n2 \u00b7B + C\nvar(xi0 \u00b7 Sit) + E(T (1\u2212\u03c1\n2\ni )\u22122\u03c1i\u2212\u03c12i+2\u03c1T+1i +2\u03c1T+2i \u2212\u03c12T+2i\nT 2(1\u2212\u03c12i )(1\u2212\u03c1i)2\n) \u00b7A+ (T+1)24 \u00b7B + C\n(11)\nwhere A = var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2), B = var(\u03b1iSit), and C =\n(T+1)\n2 cov(xi0Sit, \u03b1iSit).\nProof: See appendix.\nThe only change to this formula from the preceding case (equation 10) is the coefficients of the\nsecond term of both the numerator and denominator.\nBoth case (a) and (b) are encompassed in case (c) in the limit.15 The interesting case where \u03c1i is\nbetween 0 and 1, the ratio of the second terms will be less than 1 and \u03b21, a weighted average of 1, a\nvalue less than 1, and 2. Again, if the magnitude of the cross-section variation is large and the time\nseries is short, more weight will be put on 1 and we can still obtain \u03b21 = 1.16\nTo summarize the theoretical predictions of \u03b21 for the cross-sectional regression specification:\nCase (a): \u03b21 = 1.\nCase (b): \u03b21 is a weighted average of 1, 1.5, and 2, the weights depending on the magnitude of the\ncross-section variance, the white-noise variance, the trend variance and T . If the cross-section variance\nis big and time T is relatively small, we can see \u03b21 = 1; if the trend variance and\/or T is very large,\nwe can see \u03b21 = 2.\nCase (c): when \u03c1i is between 0 and 1, \u03b21 is a weighted average of 1, a value less than 1, and 2. If the\n15Note that \u03c1i and \u03b1i both being equal to 0 for all i brings us back to the stationary case (a). \u03c1i = 1 brings us back\nto the unit root case without trend (if \u03b1i = 0 for all i), or the unit root case with trend (if \u03b1i is not 0 for all i), as in\ncase (b). The more interesting case is when \u03c1i is between 0 and 1.\n16However, it is possible to have \u03b21 being below 1 if the magnitude of the second terms is larger than the magnitude\nof the third terms in a small sample. But when T becomes very large, \u03b21 can gradually converge to 2 as in case (b).\n13\ncross-section variance is large and T is relatively small, \u03b21 is equal to 1; if the trend variance is large\nand\/or T is very big, \u03b21 can be equal to 2.\nClearly, the result that \u03b21 = 1 should not be considered as a verification to the growth-effect theory\nand the result is consistent with all three cases of x. However, at this point, not much can be said\nabout the underlying DGP of x. With 31 years of data, we are stuck with a relatively short time-series\nthat make all of these cases a possibility.\n3.2 The Levels Regression\nOne way to get around this difficulty and to be able to say something about the DGP of x is to do\nthe same exercise for the levels regression, CAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i, where CAit and Sit are now\nactually levels of the current account and levels of savings. In the previous section, we are confronted\nwith the puzzling regression result that \u03b21 = 2 in this levels specification, even though the \u201dnew rule\u201d\nprescribes the two specifications to be equivalent in predicting \u03b21 = 1. The explicit formula of \u03b21 in\nthis specification is the same as before except that the levels replace shares for each of the terms. As\nwe know, saving rates differ little across countries relative to the difference in the levels of savings\nacross countries, the sizes of economies being remarkably different. Hence, switching to the levels\nregression amounts to effectively putting more weight on the trend variation term, thus reducing the\n\u201cshort\u201d time series problem by effectively magnifying the \u201dtrend variance term\u201d and putting enough\nweight on 2 so that even with a relatively short time series, we may still observe 2 if the true DGP\nwere case (b) or case (c).17\nFrom the data sample, the cross-sectional variation is on the order of magnitude of 1019, the sample\nwhite-noise variation, T+12 10\n19, and the sample trend variation, T (T+1)2 10\n18. With T=31, the number\nof years in our sample, it is clear that the trend variation term can dominate, pushing \u03b21 towards 2.\nIn this case, the result that \u03b21 = 2 in the levels regression is not consistent with case (a), but with\ncases (b) and (c). Recall that in the shares regression specification \u03b21 = 1 is consistent with all three\ncases, so that we can conclude that only case (b) and case (c) are the possible true DGP of x. The\nsupporting evidence for the growth-effect theory was in fact misinterpreted.\n17More specifically, the levels regression puts more weight on large economies and large economies, such as the U.S.\nand Japan, happen to have trends in their portfolio shares.\n14\n4 Empirical Analysis\nWith the theoretical analysis in the previous section suggesting that the process of x (consistent with\n\u03b21 = 2) is a nonstationary process or a highly persistent process with trend, we proceed to investigate\nthis directly. A first glance at the graphs (Figure 2) of the portfolio share over time for each of the 22\ncountries seems to suggest that x is unlikely to be constant, but rather changing over time, with some\ncountries seeming to display a secular trend.\nTo be more concrete, we run a few econometric tests to examine the process of x. Consider the\nsimplest possible case of x following an AR(1) process, where xt = \u03b10 + \u03b11xt\u22121 + \u03b5t.18 Results are\nreported in Table 4. It is clear that \u03b11 is very close to 1 (within 2 standard deviations) or even slightly\ngreater than 1, for most countries in our sample. This suggests that x may follow a unit-root process.\nIn this case, we proceed to conduct augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for each individual country. With\nvarious specifications that include and exclude time trends and different lengths of time lags, unit roots\ncan be rejected for at most eight countries out of the twenty-two countries in the sample.19 There\nare fourteen countries in our sample for which none of the Dickey-Fuller tests can reject unit root at\nconventional significance levels.\n[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]\nThese results notwithstanding, it is a well known fact that these unit root tests have very low power\nfor short time series, not easily rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root. Given that there are only\n31 observations (1973-2003) for each country, the above results cannot be conclusive. Nevertheless,\nthe results of these simple econometric tests show that x is likely to be a highly persistent AR (1)\nprocess or a unit root process, with some countries displaying a time trend, effectively giving support\nto our theoretical analysis in the previous section.20\n18This regression is run for each individual country using the Mark II data, which has the longest time series.\n19The Dickey-Fuller test without trend or lags rejects unit root for Mexico. The specification including time lags\nrejects unit roots for Switzerland, Korea and Mexico, and the specification including a time trend rejects Israel and\nJapan. Including both lags and trends rejects unit roots for Austria, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and New Zealand.\n20An important caveat is that x being a highly persistent process or unit root process with trend in the very long run\nis somewhat inconceivable and difficult to reconcile with theories that have a steady-state portfolio share. But available\ndata simply cannot reject this result. This outcome may reflect the fact that the world is still on a transitional path to\na new steady state, with countries integrating more deeply into the global economy without having yet fully reached its\nsteady state portfolio equilibrium. Our main point is that so long as the process of x is observationally equivalent to a\nunit root process with trend for this sample period, the regression result \u03b2 = 1 based on this data sample will inevitably\nbe the outcome of the dominance of a cross-sectional variation generated by an account equation. On the other hand,\neven if x is stationary in the very long run, which may be likely, \u03b21 = 1 in a cross-section regression remains to be driven\nby accounting, and therefore continues to confer no information.\n15\n[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]\nWe have shown that results taken to be evidence for the growth-effect theory is overturned, both\nfrom our theoretical and empirical analysis. The follow-up question is, to what extent should current\naccount movements be attributed to portfolio composition adjustments and to what extent is the\ngrowth effect still quantitatively important, according to the synthesized accounting framework?\nTo see this, we decompose the change in net foreign asset positions into the composition effect\nand the growth effect using Equation 3 and normalize them by current GDP.21 Figure 3 plots these\ntwo time series for each country. Two salient features emerge: First, the growth effect is smooth and\nchanges slowly. For example, as the U.S. gradually slid into a big debtor in the mid 1980\u2019s, the growth\neffect also gradually turned from positive into negative. The opposite case is Japan, the growth effect\nbecomes more and more positive as Japan accumulates huge foreign assets. The growth effect does\nseem to capture some long-run movements in the current account but for reasons that are completely\ndifferent from the one argued by Kraay and Ventura (2000, 2003). It simply reflects an accounting fact:\na country that continues to run current account deficits must become a debtor and a debtor country\nmust be running current account deficits on average. Second, the composition effect is very volatile\nand accounts for most variations of the current account in a country over time. To be more concrete,\nwe perform a variance decomposition exercise on the accounting equation, CA = \u2206x \u00b7W + x \u00b7 S. The\nresults are reported in Table 5. Clearly, the composition effect is much more important in explaining\nthe variations of the current account than the growth effect for most countries in our sample.\n[INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE]\nIt is noteworthy that this empirical result is also in line with results that emerge from a numerical\nexample in Tille and Van Wincoop (2008), which decomposes international capital flows generated by\nthe model into the growth effect (portfolio growth) and the composition effect (portfolio reallocation).22\nIn their example it is also true that the growth effect is quite smooth while the majority of the variation\nin the current account is due to the composition effect.23\n[INSERT TABLE 5 HERE]\n21Here we use the data taken from the \u201dMark II\u201d dataset\n22They further decompose the composition effect into parts that come from changes in expected excess returns and\nthat which come from time-varying second moments. See Chart 8 and 9 in Tille and Van Wincoop (2008).\n23More specifically, it is due to time-varying second moments.\n16\n5 Conclusion\nWe have analyzed a non-structural framework of the current account that is based upon an important\naccounting identity that highlights two channels of current account adjustment: a composition effect\nand a growth effect. The framework is general enough to nest the majority of the literature on\nthe portfolio view of the current account, while allowing for the interplay between the composition\neffect and the growth effect also emphasized in the recent general equilibrium portfolio models. This\nframework can be used as a guideline for more specific theories, which will have to be compatible with\nour empirical findings regarding the quantitative importance of the two effects.\nWe have shown that partial equilibrium models, without reference to a synthesized framework\nmay give rise to misleading interpretations of current account movements. Our basic message is\nclear: never again run a K-V-type cross-country regression regardless of the underlying DGP of the\nportfolio share; there is simply no information embedded in this regression. It is therefore clear that\npartial equilibrium portfolio models cannot supplant general equilibrium models in explaining external\nadjustments despite their seemingly remarkable empirical success in the past.\nThis paper attempts to further the very little existing empirical work on portfolio models of the\ncurrent account. Using the accounting framework as a guideline, we theoretically and empirically over-\nturn the growth effect theory, and reestablish the composition effect as the quantitatively significant\ndriver of current account dynamics. Using both direct and indirect empirical evidence, we show that\nthe net foreign asset share is far from being constant or even stationary, as is required by a growth-\neffect theory, but is in fact a highly persistent process or a unit root process, with some countries\ndisplaying a trend. Along with general equilibrium models, this synthesized framework points to the\ncomponents that matter for the current account, including the components that have not mattered\nso much in the past but may potentially matter quite substantially in the future. In a world with\nexploding gross holdings of external assets and liabilities, it is possible that the growth effect may\novertake the composition effect in contributing to current account dynamics, and the systematic inclu-\nsion of it despite its small relevance in the past data may become essential. Newly developed general\nequilibrium models embody precisely this level of comprehensiveness and can therefore serve to be a\nbenchmark for future analyses on portfolio views of external imbalances. In a financial world that is\nintegrating ever more profoundly, theoretical and empirical work in this area need to keep up with\n17\nglobal trends\u2013 furthering our understanding of the facts and the theory will be important for handling\nthe massive global capital flows that we will, in all likelihood, continue to witness.\nReferences\n[1] Blanchard, O., Giavazzi, F., Sa, F., 2005.

The countries include Austria, Australia, Canada, Switzer-\nland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea,\n20\nMexico, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Portugal, Sweden, and the U.S.24 We select post-1973\ndata, the years after Bretton Woods collapsed.\nFor measures of the net foreign asset position and the current account, we use both the traditional\nmeasure taken from the IIP data in IFS and \u201dMark I\u201d and \u201dMark II\u201d estimates from Lane et al (2001)\nand Lane et al (2007), which consistently account for valuation effects and capital gains, although\nthe methodologies have slightly changed from one dataset to another. They provide an accounting\nframework which highlights the link between the balance and payment flows and the underlying\nstocks, as well as the impact of unrecorded capital flight, exchange rate fluctuations, debt reduction,\nand valuation changes not captured in the conventional current account definition. Through this link,\nthey show that one method of estimating net foreign assets is cumulating the current account and\nadjusting for the capital account balance. We take their net foreign asset measure, which is just the\n\u201dadjusted-cumulative current account\u201d. For our current account, we take the first difference of their\n\u201dadjusted cumulative current account\u201d measure with consistent capital gains and losses and valuation\neffects. By doing so, we effectively capture the valuation effect and capital gains and losses for both\nthe current account and net foreign assets measure.\nTo measure the domestic capital stock, we use the perpetual inventory method:25 we cumulate\ngross domestic investment in current U.S. dollars taken from the World Bank\u2019s Global Development\nIndicators, assuming a depreciation rate of 4 percent a year, and in each year revaluing the previous\nyear\u2019s stock using the U.S. GDP deflator. We take 1965 as the starting year. The capital stock in 1965\nis estimated using the average capital-output ratio over the period 1960-1965 in Nehru and Dhareshwar\n(1993), multiplied by GDP in 1965. All variables are denoted in current U.S. dollars.\n6.2 Appendix B\nCase (a):\nSince xit = xi + \u03b5it, in particular, we have xiT = xi + \u03b5iT and xit = xi +\nPT\nj=1 \u03b5ij\nT ' xi, where\nthe second equality come from the fact that the average of independent shocks is approximately 0 (a\nmore detailed derivation without taking this approximation is available upon request). Equation 7,\n24We omit the following OECD countries: Belgium, Greece, Hungary, and Luxemburg, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovak\nRepublic, and Turkey for the reason that, except for Belgium and Luxembourg, these countries do not have full time\nseries of all variables between 1973 and 2003. Belgium and Luxembourg are omitted because they are often reported as\none in some datasets while reported separately in others.\n25Kraay and Ventura (2000) uses the same methodology in constructing their dataset of 13 countries over 1973-1995.\n21\nCAit = xiT \u00b7 Sit, implies that CAit = (xi + \u03b5iT ) \u00b7 Sit. Plugging these equations into the regression\nCAit = \u03b20 + \u03b21xit \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i, we then have (xit + \u03b5iT ) \u00b7 Sit = \u03b20 + \u03b21(xi) \u00b7 Sit + \u03b7i. Therefore \u03b21 =\ncov((xi\u00b7Sit,(xi+\u03b5iT )\u00b7Sit)\nvar((xi\u00b7Sit) =\nvar(xi\u00b7Sit)\nvar(xi\u00b7Sit) = 1. For the savings rate case, simply replace Sit by\nSit\nYit\n.\nCase (b):\nSince xit = \u03b1i + xit\u22121 + \u03b5it, we have xit = xi0 + \u03b1it +\n\u2211t\nj=1 \u03b5ij . In particular, xiT = xi0 + \u03b1iT +\u2211T\nj=1 \u03b5ij and xit = xi0 +\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2 +\nT\u03b5i1+(T\u22121)\u03b5i2+...\u03b5iT\nT . Again, equation (7) CAit = xiT \u00b7 Sit implies\nthat CAit = (xi0 + \u03b1iT +\n\u2211t\nj=1 \u03b5ij) \u00b7 Sit. Plugging these equations into the the regression\nCAit = \u03b20+\u03b21xit\u00b7Sit+\u03b7i, we then have \u03b21 = cov((xi0+\u03b1iT+\nPT\nj=1 \u03b5ij)\u00b7Sit,(xi0+\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2\n+\nT\u03b5i1+(T\u22121)\u03b5i2+...\u03b5iT\nT\n)\u00b7Sit)\nvar(xi0+\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2\n+\nT\u03b5i1+(T\u22121)\u03b5i2+...\u03b5iT\nT\n)\u00b7Sit)\n.\nExpanding the variances and covariances term by term, we obtain finally \u03b21 =\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+T+12 A+\nT (T+1)\n2\nB+C\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+ (2T+1)(T+1)6T A+\n(T+1)2\n4\nB+C\n,\nwhere A = var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2), B = var(\u03b1iSit), and C =\n(T+1)\n2 cov(xi0Sit, \u03b1iSit).\nNotice that for the case that \u03b1i = 0 for all i (non-stationary case without trend), we have \u03b21 =\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+T+12 var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2\n)\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+ (2T+1)(T+1)6T var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2\n)\n. For the savings rate case, simply replace Sit by SitYit .\nCase (c):\nSince xit = xio + \u03b1it +\n\u2211t\nj=1 \u03c1\nt\u2212j\ni \u03b5ij , in particular, we have xiT = xi0 + \u03b1iT +\n\u2211T\nj=1 \u03c1\nT\u2212j\ni \u03b5ij and\nxit = xi0 +\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2 +\n1\n1\u2212\u03c1i\nPT\nj=1(1\u2212\u03c1T+1\u2212ji )\u03b5ij\nT . Again, Equation (7), CAit = xiT \u00b7Sit, implies that CAit =\n(xi0+\u03b1iT+\n\u2211T\nj=1 \u03c1\nT\u2212j\ni \u03b5ij) \u00b7Sit. Plugging these equations into the regression CAit = \u03b20+\u03b21xit \u00b7Sit+\u03b7i,\nwe then have\n\u03b21 =\ncov((xi0+\u03b1iT+\nPT\nj=1 \u03c1\nT\u2212j\ni \u03b5ij)\u00b7Sit,(xi0+\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2\n+\n1\n1\u2212\u03c1i\nTP\nj=1\n(1\u2212\u03c1T+1\u2212j\ni\n)\u03b5ij\nT\n)\u00b7Sit)\nvar(xi0+\n\u03b1i(T+1)\n2\n+\n1\n1\u2212\u03c1i\nTP\nj=1\n(1\u2212\u03c1T+1\u2212j\ni\n)\u03b5ij\nT\n)\u00b7Sit)\n.\nExpanding the variances and covariances term by term, we obtain finally\n\u03b21 =\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+E( 1\u2212\u03c1\nT\ni \u2212\u03c1\nT+1\ni\n+\u03c12T+1\ni\nT (1\u2212\u03c1i)2(1+\u03c1i)\n)\u00b7A+T (T+1)\n2\n\u00b7B+C\nvar(xi0\u00b7Sit)+E(T (1\u2212\u03c1\n2\ni\n)\u22122\u03c1i\u2212\u03c12i+2\u03c1\nT+1\ni\n+2\u03c1T+2\ni\n\u2212\u03c12T+2\ni\nT2(1\u2212\u03c12\ni\n)(1\u2212\u03c1i)2\n)\u00b7A+ (T+1)2\n4\n\u00b7B+C\n,\nwhere A = var(\u03b5it)E(Sit\n2), B = var(\u03b1iSit), and C =\n(T+1)\n2 cov(xi0Sit, \u03b1iSit).
