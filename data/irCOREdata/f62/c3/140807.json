There are several drivers both to\nreduce emissions from homes and to reduce fuel poverty, promoting a range of building and\nbehavioural measures in homes. The health benefits of warmer homes in winter have been\ndescribed, but there has been less consideration of the potential negative impacts of some\nof these measures.\nWe examine the changes in our homes, and the possible consequences for health. The\nmain concerns for health surround the potential for poor indoor air quality if ventilation is\ninsufficient, and the possible risks of over-heating in heatwave conditions. We note a\nlimited evidence base and the need for further research on the health effects of energy-\nefficient homes, particularly with regard to ventilation.\nKeywords\nHealth, Homes, Energy efficiency, Indoor Air Quality, Heatwave\n3Introduction\nThe indoor environment is a significant determinant of population health. People in\nindustrialised countries spend approximately 80% of their time indoors1,2. Those at\nextremes of age or in poor health are likely to spend considerably more time at home than\nothers; they may be particularly affected by changes to the indoor environment. The health\nsector has an important role in ensuring healthy indoor environments for all.\nThree main drivers are promoting the building and refurbishing of homes to make them\nmore energy efficient. Firstly, housing accounts for 27% of current carbon dioxide (CO2)\nemissions in the United Kingdom (UK)3. Home energy-efficiency is seen as a key part of the\nUK Government\u2019s commitment to an 80% reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels by\n20504. Secondly, the national Fuel Poverty Strategy incorporates home energy efficiency as\npart of its framework to eradicate fuel poverty in vulnerable households by 2010 5. Lastly,\nthe current financial crisis may encourage householders to contain energy costs by making\ntheir homes more energy efficient. Given the impact of the recent recession on the building\nindustry, now is an opportune time to examine whether there is sufficient information on the\nimpact on occupant health of existing building policy, guidance and practice.\nThe UK has one of the highest rates of excess winter mortality in Europe, with currently\nabout 25,000 excess winter deaths each year 6. These deaths are at least partially related\nto poor housing 7. Much of the research and policy emphasis to date has been on exploring\nhow energy efficiency measures may benefit health through improved indoor temperatures\nin winter. However, it is important that we also consider and mitigate any potential hazards\nto health. Chief among our concerns is the impact on indoor air quality (such as levels of\nradon, products of combustion, pollutants released by furnishings, building materials and\nconsumer products, environmental tobacco smoke, mould and house dust mites), and the\n4potential risk of over-heating during heatwave conditions. Both hazards may have a\nsignificant impact on occupant health and well-being.\nChanges in our homes\nTraditional UK housing has low thermal performance and high levels of air permeability. An\nestimated 15% of all UK homes (3.4 million) fail the thermal comfort criteria for a \u2018decent\nhome\u20198. The changes recommended to save energy and improve the thermal comfort of our\nhomes include improved standards of insulation and air tightness, high efficiency boilers,\ndouble-glazing, and behaviour change (e.g. switching appliances off at the wall).\nIn the UK, new-build and structural change in existing homes must comply with Building\nRegulations to ensure the health and safety of those in and around the building. The\nBuilding Regulations set out the requirements with which individual aspects of building\ndesign and construction must comply. There are 14 Parts that cover aspects such as\nstructure, access, fire safety, electrical safety, waste disposal, energy use, ventilation etc.9.\n\u2018Approved Documents\u2019 provide guidance on how each part of the Building Regulations may\nbe achieved. To reduce emissions from residential buildings, a progressive tightening of\nBuilding Regulation Part L (Conservation of Heat and Power) is underway. Part F\n(Ventilation) is being revised in tandem, aiming to ensure that increased air tightness does\nnot compromise indoor air quality. The intention is that by 2016 all new homes will be\n\u2018zero carbon\u2019. This is to be achieved by 2015 for social housing funded under the National\nAffordable Housing Programme.\nAlongside the Building Regulations is the \u2018Code for Sustainable Homes (CSH) 2007\u2019, against\nwhich, from 2008, it has been mandatory for all new homes to be rated10 (table 1). The\nCSH is an aspirational framework for the design and construction of new homes, and\nindicates the likely direction of travel of the Regulations11. By 2010, 2013, and 2016 all\n5new homes should achieve \u2018Code 3, 4 and 6\u2019 respectively. A CSH rating provides valuable\ninformation to homebuyers and provides a means by which housebuilders may differentiate\nthemselves. \u2018Health\u2019 is included as one of the nine categories against which new homes are\nrated, but its characterisation is limited to sound insulation, good daylighting, private\noutdoor space, and \u2018lifetime homes\u2019 (homes that are accessible and adaptable). Indoor air\nquality is not directly addressed. Most weight in the rating is given to easily definable\nmeasures of energy and water usage, rather than health benefit. At present, there are less\nthan 100 homes in the UK rated against the CSH, although nearly 200,000 have been\nregistered for future construction12.\nA whole house ventilation rate of between 0.5 and 1.0 air changes per hour is considered to\nusually represent adequate ventilation13. At this level of air change, relative humidity is\nunlikely to exceed 70% for prolonged periods, thus preventing condensation and mould\ngrowth. At present, ventilation is mostly achieved by air infiltration of the building structure\nand window opening. As houses become increasingly airtight, less reliance can be placed on\na building\u2019s air permeability to provide adequate ventilation. \u2018Purpose-provided\u2019 ventilation\nwill need to be increased \u2013 either using natural\/passive or mechanical (forced flow) systems.\nIn very air tight homes, such as CSH Code 5 and 6, mechanical systems are likely to be\nrequired. Mechanical ventilation has the advantage that it is more easily controllable than\nnatural systems, and if equipped with an efficient heat recovery system will help save\nenergy and maintain indoor temperatures. However, it represents a step-change in building\ndesign and system use for the UK. Mechanical systems need correct commissioning,\ninstallation, and maintenance, and there is, at present, no dedicated trade body or\naccredited training for the installation and servicing of mechanical ventilation systems in the\nUK. The ability of these systems to achieve the recommended ventilation rates post\noccupancy is rarely measured. Mechanical systems also require energy to operate and may\nbe noisy, with the attendant risk that occupants may not use them or interfere with their\n6operation. Several studies have demonstrated a lack of occupant awareness and\nunderstanding of the ventilation system in their homes14,15,16. Also, a reliance on mechanical\nsystems raises concerns for health because of the risk of failure, which may be aggravated\nby poor maintenance (e.g. through not replacing filters).\nHowever, natural ventilation systems do not avoid the problem of poor installation or use,\nwith anecdotal reports of occupants sealing air bricks and trickle ventilators supplied with\ndouble glazing. Occupants may not open windows because of external noise and air\npollution, or because of security\/safety fears. Homes also risk being over-ventilated with\nunnecessary heat loss, because of the lack of control available with natural systems.\nThere is some evidence to support the hypotheses that newer homes may be under-\nventilated or have poorer indoor air quality. A national survey of UK homes found that\nlevels of formaldehyde and VOCs were highest in very new homes, but did not assess\nventilation17. A later study of 37 new UK homes built since 1995 showed that 38% had\nventilation rates in winter below the recommended level and that trickle vents were only\nfully open in four of the homes18. Mean concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen\ndioxide (NO2), formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were within typical\nranges for UK homes, with VOC levels higher in those with lowest ventilation. Elsewhere in\nEurope, experience from Sweden has demonstrated that following a national programme to\nupgrade homes, 80% of single family houses and 50% of multi-family houses were found to\nbe under ventilated19. Those living in multi-family homes built since 1976 were more likely\nto report symptoms such as hoarseness and dryness of the skin than those living in older\nhomes. The difficulties of ensuring adequate ventilation using either mechanical or natural\nsystems illustrate some of the challenges inherent in revising part F (ventilation) of the\nBuilding Regulations.\n7Although there has been progress to improve the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of\nnew-build, housing stock turnover is low (<1% annually)3. It is estimated that 70% of the\nhousing stock of 2050 has already been built20. If the 80% emission reduction target for\n2050 it to be met from the housing sector, up to 500,000 existing homes need to be\nappropriately refurbished every year21. Refurbishment to existing homes that does not\ninvolve structural change is generally outside of Building Regulation requirements, and\nperformed without scrutiny. There are a variety of policies and programmes encouraging\nenergy efficiency measures in existing homes, which may be installed on a professional or\n\u2018do-it-yourself basis\u2019, depending on the intervention involved. Ventilation requirements are\nrarely considered, although it has been shown that it is possible to substantially reduce air\npermeability in existing homes with measures such as insulation and draught stripping22,23.\nAn additional risk is that existing ventilation measures e.g. air bricks or flues from\ncombustion appliances may be inappropriately sealed.\nHealth impacts\nThe relationship between housing and health is complex and difficult to measure \u2013 e.g.\nmeasurement of exposure, multiple confounding factors, and the need for long-term follow-\nup for important health outcomes. As a result there is a lack of robust evidence on the\nhealth impacts of housing interventions24 and some debate about whether energy-efficient\nhomes are more or less beneficial for occupant health.\nThe available evidence suggests that energy-efficiency measures have a largely positive\neffect on the physical and mental health of occupants through improving winter indoor\ntemperatures and reducing fuel poverty25,26, 27, although many of these studies also\nincorporate heating upgrades. In broader global health terms, a reduction in carbon\nemissions and the consequent improvement in outdoor air quality and mitigation of climate\nchange are expected to achieve important public health gains28. Wilkinson et al have\n8recently modelled the likely health impacts under five scenarios of household intervention to\nimprove energy efficiency29. All scenarios, with important caveats, resulted in an overall\nbenefit to health, but with some negative effects relating to specific environmental factors.\nNevertheless, there are concerns about the impact on occupant health of increased air\ntightness in the absence of adequate ventilation. Insufficient ventilation increases levels of\nindoor pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde,\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs), environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), radon - all of\nwhich may be harmful to health.\nIf energy efficient homes incorporate appropriately maintained mechanical ventilation\nsystems with filtration of fine particles (PM2.5) in the incoming air there could be benefits to\npopulation health from reduced exposure to ambient particles30. Leech et al have\ndemonstrated improvements in symptom scores for throat irritation, cough, fatigue and\nirritability amongst those moving into new air tight homes with mechanical ventilation and\nheat recovery (HRV) systems, compared with those moving into standard new homes16.\nNevertheless, only 76% of the occupants in the energy efficient houses operated their HRVs\nthroughout the winter, 58% throughout the summer, and 10% did not even realise they had\nan HRV installed.\nHigh levels of relative humidity promote the growth of mould and the proliferation of house\ndust mites \u2013 both of which are implicated in the development and worsening of asthma.\nRaising winter indoor temperatures through better insulation should reduce levels of relative\nhumidity and condensation, but if ventilation is insufficient relative humidity will increase\ncausing a potential worsening of respiratory conditions. The absence of condensation and\nmould is considered indicative of adequate ventilation31. However it is not clear whether this\nremains a safe assumption with improved thermal insulation and warmer indoor\n9temperatures - there may be less mould but levels of other pollutants will remain the same\nor increase.\nThe impact of energy saving on the incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning is hard to\npredict. On the one hand, poor overall or appliance specific ventilation because of poorly\nimplemented efforts to save energy will increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. On\nthe other, a reduced reliance on fossil fuel burning in the home will reduce risk by removing\nsome sources of the gas.\nRadon is estimated to cause more than 1000 lung cancer cases per year32. Radon is usually\ndrawn in from the soil because of pressure differences that occur between the ground and\nthe internal atmosphere of buildings. The relationship between indoor radon levels and the\ninstallation of energy saving measures is complex. These measures may both increase\nindoor radon levels by improving air tightness (double-glazing of all windows was estimated\nto increase indoor radon levels by 55%, full draught-proofing by 9%33) and decrease radon\nlevels by reducing ingress from the ground (sealing unused chimneys reduces the stack\neffect, underfloor insulation may reduce radon entry). It is now clear that the risk of lung\ncancer extends below the current UK 200 Bqm3 Action Level28. In May 2008, the Health\nProtection Agency recommended that all new build, extensions and refurbishments\nregardless of area should be fitted with basic radon protective measures e.g. fitting a gas-\ntight membrane into the floor of the building 34. This is rarely practicable in an existing\nhome, and alternative measures need to be considered if a home is identified as being\nabove the current radon Action Level.\nIt is also important to consider how energy efficiency measures are likely to affect occupant\nhealth in our anticipated near-future climate. In the UK, milder winters and warmer, wetter\nsummers are expected. More frequent and more intense heatwaves are likely and it is\nestimated that by 2050 every second summer will be similar to the summer of 2003 when\n10\nthere were over 2000 extra deaths in the UK6. Whilst insulation may reduce such risks by\nkeeping heat out of the home, if heat is allowed to enter e.g. through unshaded double-\nglazed windows, thermal insulation may prevent it escaping thus increasing heat related\nhealth risks. These include an increased risk of illness and death from a wide variety of\nconditions, most commonly respiratory and cardiovascular disease. In hot weather, the\nimportance of nocturnal ventilation becomes particularly pronounced, and there is some\ndoubt about the effectiveness of mechanical ventilation systems in achieving the\nrecommended eight air changes per hour required for effective cooling in these\ncircumstances. Passive measures to reduce over-heating need to be incorporated in the\ndesign and refurbishment of buildings now to avoid a future reliance on use of air\nconditioning units to cool homes.\nThe warmer summers of the future may well be associated with higher outdoor levels of the\nirritant gas ozone and this will impact the indoor environment. Ozone reacts with material\nsurfaces and with other components of the air and therefore indoor concentrations in the\nabsence of an internal source are normally lower than outdoors. However there is some\nconcern that the products of the chemical reactions could themselves be a health risk and\nfurther research is required35.\nWhat is needed?\nAt present, evidence on the impacts on health of highly energy efficient homes in the UK is\ninsufficient36. Yet the drivers promoting the take-up of energy efficiency are likely to\nbecome more pressing, and to require more stringent measures. Policy makers need to\nensure energy is saved, whilst not undermining health, but the evidence base with which to\ninform policy is limited.\n11\nMany of the potential hazards to health associated with energy saving in homes depend\nupon whether or not sufficient ventilation is provided. Whilst there is evidence to link\nventilation to indoor air pollutants, and indoor air pollutants to health, there is less\ninformation about the direct links. There has never been a comprehensive study on the\nrole of home ventilation for ensuring health; of ventilation rates achieved in practice in UK\nhomes; or a definitive assessment of a safe minimum level of ventilation (although 0.5 air\nchanges per hour is widely recommended). It is also notable that most published studies of\nenergy efficient homes use a limited definition of occupant health, focussing on thermal\ncomfort and occupant satisfaction. There is a real need for large scale, longitudinal studies\nto assess the relationships between energy efficiency, ventilation, indoor air quality and\nhealth, and to model the relationships under different climate change scenarios.\nAs buildings become more airtight, there will be a greater reliance on mechanical ventilation\nsystems. We urgently need a better understanding of the performance of these products\npost-occupancy as well as guidance for those commissioning, installing, maintaining and\nusing such products. Anecdotal information suggests that there is a low level of public\nunderstanding about the importance of, and the best way to achieve, appropriate ventilation.\nResearch should be undertaken to gain a better understanding of the public\u2019s knowledge,\nbehaviour and attitudes with regard to ventilation.\nWe should also take the opportunity to learn from the experience of those colleagues in\nother countries with experience in the design and construction of airtight buildings, whilst\nacknowledging the importance of UK specific factors in relation to housing type, building\npractice, climate and occupant behaviour. Several countries now have standards or\npackages to assure indoor air quality in sustainable homes (e.g. the US Environmental\nProtection Agency Energy Star Indoor Air Package). The European Commission is\nsupporting an initiative to harmonise the existing voluntary schemes for labelling of low\nemitting construction products that aim to reduce the risk of poor air quality37,38. There are\n12\ncurrently no requirements in the CSH for selection of low emitting products and a scheme\nbased on the experience of other European countries should be adopted.\nClimate change is described as the biggest threat to public health in the 21st Century39.\nEnergy saving and other measures to make homes more sustainable offer a significant\nopportunity to make homes healthier. However, in order to maximise the health benefit\nfrom these policies it is imperative that we assess all of the impacts on health, and take\naction to limit the harm to occupants from any hazards identified.\n13\nAcknowledgements\nThis article was developed as a result of an expert workshop on homes, health and climate\nchange.
