Longer-term\ntrends show that mobile, networked computers will form the basis of the future of personal\ncommunications. Not only is the telephone handset becoming mobile, by defauit, but the\nboundary between phone and computer is set to disappear. Networks for mobile devices\nare also changing fast, within the next five years the global mobile network will support\nmegabit rather than the current kilobit connections. In summary most phones are becom-\ning mobile, phones are becoming computers and the underlying network is becoming a fast\nglobal TCP\/IP network.\nSince the birth of computers, it has been a design goal of hardware manufacturers to make\nsystems as small and compact as possible. This led on to the migration from monolithic\nmainframe computers to desktop workstations, and then to portable computers. In more\nrecent years a trend has emerged for full function 'palmtop' computers, such as the Toshiba\n44\nAu-J Volume 7 Number 3\nThe Hip PC -\nThe Xybernaut MA IV\nSS233MHZ Pentium MMX\nSSHead Mounted Dbplay\nSS64MBofRAM\n\u00abWin\u00ae95\nSJ2.1GB hard drive\nSSpeech recognition\n11\n\u2014 . \u2022 % \" - - = . . . . . , . \u00bb _ ^ 1\n:\nAS,\nFigure \/ a: Xybernaut wearable computer Figure Ib: A modified palmtop computer\nLibretto, and even 'wearable' computers (Starner, Mann, Rhodes, Levine, Healey, Kirsch,\nPicard and Pentland, 1997). Today wearable computers allow us to explore the applications\nthat will be widely accessible in the near future.\nThe authors use the term wearable to refer to all Information and Communication\nTechnology (ICT) devices that are designed to be mobile. While portable computers are\ncarried to a location and used when the user is stationary, wearable computers are designed to\nbe used whilst the user is moving around and active in other tasks. Most wearables today are\nbelt-mounted computers or palmtops (see Figures la and lb). The authors believe such\ndevices, in combination with location and other forms of 'context' awareness, enable\n'ubiquitous communications' in which the user is given appropriate communications channels\nand multimedia information based on their location and task within a real world environment.\nThe implications of this for learning are significant; a 'contextual' wearable device would\nhave the potential to deliver timely information, in an appropriate medium and at an\nappropriate level of detail. Another research focus is on using wearables to allow people in\na real world environment to access remote people and multimedia information held within\nan online collaborative virtual environment. The concept of fusing real and virtual space, a\nform of collaborative mixed reality, is being explored through the development of an\neducational environment called 'MetaPark'. MetaPark is currently under construction and\nconsists of a collaborative virtual environment modelled on a real park that is used by\nschools in central Ipswich as a learning resource.\nMost applications for commercial wearable computers, typically belt-mounted PCs\nrunning the Windows operating system, have been restricted to tasks involving mobile data\ninput or retrieval. However, body-worn networked computing devices are suited to many\napplications and the impact on personal communications will be significant. For example,\na networked wearable computer can behave as a mobile phone, audio graphic conferencing\nterminal, a video conference terminal or as a virtual conferencing terminal (Walker and\nSheppard, 1997). Let us not forget the mobile phone itself, the most widely used,\nnetworked wearable on the planet. Although the physical device has a limited multi-modal\ninterface it can act as a 'thin client' to network embedded services, for example allowing\nusers to send and receive email, fax and video.\nMuch of the current research activity around wearables is addressing 'contextual information\nservices', primarily 'mobile location services'. These aim to deliver timely and location specific\nmedia, such as traffic reports or tourist information, to either mobile phones or palmtop PC\n45\nJerry Bowskill and Nick Dyer Wearable learning tools\nterminals (Pascoe, 1998). Our research focus is on the application of wearables to computer\nsupported collaborative working, achieving 'ubiquitous telepresence' as a result of combining\ntraditional audio-visual conferencing with collaborative virtual environments. MetaPark is\nthe practical embodiment of these ideas, a persistent online space that provides contextually\nappropriate access to colleagues, services and information. In concept this is similar to the\nidea of 'co-habited mixed realities' (Van de Velde, 1998); as 'wearers' move through the real\nworld they also move through either literal or abstract virtual environments. For example,\nwhen entering our research laboratory the wearer is connected to an augmented reality\nconferencing session with other team members who are working remotely.\nThe goal is to deliver 'seamless service': a repurposing of interface and content, which\ndelivers appropriate functionality to the user across a range of devices and in a variety of\nsettings. The vision is of 'ubiquitous telepresence', sharing many features with the earlier\nwork on 'ubiquitous computing' (Weiser, 1991), and 'ubiquitous media' (Buxton, 1997).\nOur vision of wearables as contextual communications devices is being explored based on\nour previous research and subjective evaluations of wearable communications. A Wearable\nCommunication Space, WearCom (Billinghurst, Bowskill, Jessop and Morphett, 1998) for\nexample, allows a wearable computer user to communicate with multiple remote people in\na virtual environment that supports high quality audio communication, visual\nrepresentations of the collaborators and an underlying spatial metaphor. Preliminary\nindications suggest that spatial cues significantly improve the effectiveness of multiparty\nconferencing, which is particularly significant for mobile communications as the user has\ntypically more distractions than a desk-bound user. In previous research, we found that\nusers can locate information more rapidly with this type of spatial information display\nthan the more traditional desktop metaphor information displays (Billinghurst, Bowskill,\nDyer and Morphett, 1998). Spatial displays also scored more highly during subjective\nevaluations. Taking an educational fieldtrip scenario, we then looked at how real and\nvirtual environments could be connected together with wearable devices acting as the\ntechnological bridge, and this is illustrated below, in the next section.\nMetaPark - an overview\nMetaPark has evolved after a number of years' research into the use of collaborative\nvirtual learning environments using a variety of interface and interaction modalities,\nincluding interactive video environments (TVE) and wearable augmented reality\ninformation spaces. In developing the MetaPark concept we wanted to demonstrate the\nbenefits of using wearable computing technology within an educational context. The\ncommon requirements of wearables for learning are:\nInformation Retrieval - The ability to retrieve stored information based on current loca-\ntion, task or other forms of context represents the 'killer application' for mobile devices. A\nuser should also be able to use the device to make their own queries in the same way as they\nwould via a conventional Internet search engine (for example a text search).\nNavigation - Knowing where you are (and where other people and resources are) is also a\ncritical requirement for wearables. In addition to conventional satellite navigation, the\nability to guide people was seen as desirable, particularly within a defined context such as a\nvisit to a museum.\n46\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nFigure 2: The MetaPark\nworld\nInformation Capture - The ability to capture images, sounds, 'notes' and sketches. These\ncould be stored remotely, locally and accessed on demand.\nCommunications - Conventional 'synchronous' audio, asynchronous 'text chat' and email\nmessaging and the ability to send video to support communications with others. Many of\nthe children in our focus group are members of text chat communities on the Internet.\nRecreation - A learning device should be fun and rewarding to use. A large number of\nchildren in our focus group saw wearables as an extension of current hand-held gaming\ndevices, but being used in context.\nMetaPark was designed to focus upon the effectiveness of communication, information\nretrieval, navigation and information recording. The central idea is to create a 'cohabited\nmixed reality' using a literal virtual representation of a real world park which is accessible\neither online or by moving through the real world space itself. The virtual model of\nChristchurch Park, Ipswich, which forms the basis of the MetaPark concept, is shown in\nFigure 2.\nLocal schools were consulted and confirmed that they could see the potential for\nMetaPark, both as being a framework for continuous education and also as providing real\nsupport for fieldtrips. It is envisaged that for a MetaPark study a class of children will be\nsplit into two groups, one of which will remain in a classroom, whilst the other is taken to a\nlocation of interest (in this case Christchurch Park, Ipswich). The field workers at the park\nwill be given wearable computers that will contain park-related information, com-\nmunications software, a GPS unit and data-recording utilities. The group in the classroom\nwill work on a computer that has the 3D representation of the park as a real-time\nsimulation. Our intention is for the children at both locations to use the same wearable\ninterface devices although the classroom devices will be1 used to navigate a virtual world\ndisplayed on a large room-based display.\n47\nJerry Bowskill and Nick Dyer Wearable learning tools\nChildren In the classroom\nDesktop PC's with 3D simulation\nof Christchurch Park\nRemote children at Christchurch Park\nHandheld PC's with GPS and\nmobile GSM communications\nFigure 3: A MetaPark overview\nThe positional data from the remote GPS system will be used to place a virtual\nrepresentation of the remote group within the 3D-park model. This will allow the class\ngroup to follow the path of the remote group as they explore the environment, as well as\nallowing the path data to be saved. The communications software will allow the remote\nand the class children to text chat and talk to each other so that each group can exchange\ninformation and ideas as well as taking location-specific notes (Figure 3).\nIn order to promote information exchange and communications between the children, the\ncontent would have to be contrived such that the remote and classroom groups receive\ndifferent types of information and each group would be given different objectives which\nrely upon help from the opposite group.\nTo facilitate the technical communications between each computer unit, we are designing a\nnetwork infrastructure that supports text chat and binary file transfer, and additionally\nallows transparent transitions between different service providers (wireless LAN, modem,\ninfrared). Known as the MUON Framework (see below), this network architecture also\ntracks the user's location, based upon a predefined beacon list, and will also provide\nrudimentary information about the user's current level of activity. Using these cues, the\nclassroom group should be able to alter their communications strategy as the remote group\nundergoes different state and location changes. The virtual environment running within the\nclassroom is not limited to a single connection. It will also support remote collaborative\naccess, so that other groups can enter the MetaPark - providing further input to the\nchildren's activities by communicating with the remote group as well as other virtual\ngroups.\nThe MUON framework\nIn order to support the communications model for the MetaPark project, it was necessary\nto design a network architecture that allowed mobile users to communicate without the\nneed to understand the underlying technical issues. The solution was a client\/server\nnetwork support system called the MUON (Mobile User Object Notification) framework.\nThe details of the MUON framework architecture are discussed in a previous publication\n48\nALT-] Volume 7 Number 3\n(Dyer and Bowskill, 1999); however the features that it supports, and those that underlie\nmany future wearables applications, are outlined below.\nSynchronous and asynchronous communications\nThe most common form of asynchronous communication is email. The MUON frame-\nwork supports a similar asynchronous messaging system that allows users to send text and\nbinary (pictures, files, etc.) data to offline recipients. This data is then stored on a server in\nthe recipient's persistent database, ready for when they next log on. When two (or more)\nusers are online simultaneously, a dialogue can be arranged between each client. This semi-\nsynchronous communications medium is more commonly known as text-chat. For\nsynchronous communications, both users must be online and have enough available band-\nwidth to cope with the continuous stream of data between them. Audio and video\ncommunications channels are then possible. The MUON framework will not provide\nsynchronous communications services directly, but will support external IP-based services\nby negotiating the connection and disconnection processes between the users.\nLocation awareness\nTo facilitate location awareness, the client requires a mechanism that determines its current\nposition within a pre-defined mapping of physical space. This is tackled by the use of GPS\nfor outdoor locations and radio location beacons and client receiver modules for indoor\nlocations. The beacons are autonomous units that transmit a specific code that is used to\ndenote location. These devices are inexpensive and can transmit a signal that can be\nreceived with sufficient accuracy even where physical obstructions cause radio attenuation.\nThe major disadvantage is that these devices all transmit the same frequency and can\ntherefore cause interference when used in close proximity with each other. To alleviate the\nproblem, the strength of the beacon must be balanced between providing adequate\ncoverage for each specific location, and enough attenuation to prevent interference with\nneighbouring beacons. From a software viewpoint, a primary server maintains a master\ndatabase of each named location matched with its respective beacon code. When a client\nreceives a beacon message (by passing close enough to a beacon for the receiving device to\ninterpret a location code), it passes this up to the server, which replies with the matching\nlocation name. In this manner, the server can track each client as it moves around its\nenvironment and a user can interrogate the system to find the location of another client.\nThe issue of privacy is managed by allowing users to switch dynamically between broad-\ncasting or hiding their location as they see fit.\nLocation-based messaging\nWith the ability to determine location, the network can also provide another service:\nlocation-based messaging. This is where a message can be directed to a location instead of\nan individual user. As users with location tracking devices move around their environment,\nthey receive messages that have been 'posted' to their current location. Conversely, they may\npost messages at specific locations. To illustrate, a location message could be posted to\nsomeone's desk to inform passers by (or those specifically looking for them) that they are on\nleave for the next two weeks, and should be contacted via email only for important\nmessages. The location messages are sent to the server, and stored in the beacon database.\nWhen messages have expired, the server deletes them accordingly. Each message is assigned\na unique ID, that is used to amend a user's database each time they read a location message,\nto prevent continuous notifications being sent for messages they have previously received.\n49\nJerry Bowskill and Nick Dyer Wearable learning tools\nTransparent network switching\nOne of the key functions provided by the MUON framework is network switching. This is\nthe ability to switch automatically between different service providers when either the\nconnection drops, or a better bandwidth is available under a different service provider. The\nsupported service providers are wired LAN, wireless radio LAN, infrared via serial, direct\nserial connection, and modem (including GSM mobile modem). Clients can select the best\nservice providers available at log-on time, and monitor the availability of other services\nbased on a pre-defined prioritized list.\nAvailability and contextual awareness\nThe nature of wearable computers dictates that the user can be in many states of\navailability according to their current situation. It is also the job of the wearable computer\nto determine which is the most appropriate form of feedback to notify the user of system\nevents (such as new messages). For example it may be inappropriate for a user to receive a\nvisual notification if they are running down a street; an audio notification would be safer!\nAlso if the user were engaged in a meeting, it would be appropriate for the wearable\ncomputer to limit the availability of the user to receiving urgent messages only. Although\nthese issues are not addressed directly by the MUON framework, one design is to allow\nMUON clients to employ the features of agent technologies that provide user availability\ninformation, and allow the system to respond to this information accordingly. Switching\nthe context of the messages could be controlled by an external agent. The agent would feed\ninformation into the MUON client, allowing visual and audio notifications to be triggered\nappropriately. The provision for this type of service is accounted for by the use of\n'gateways', which connect the primary server to agent servers allowing information to be\nexchanged between various applications. This allows clients to utilize these services\nwithout the need to have a predefined IP address (as some of the agent servers require this)\nor be continuously connected to the network, as the primary server (which does have a\nunique IP address) acts as the go-between.\nDiscussion\nThe MetaPark concept provides avenues for a number of research threads. While the\nMetaPark environment is still being developed, the authors have been able to demonstrate\nelements of the system. For example the underlying network framework has been\nimplemented, sample collaborative virtual environments have been constructed and an\nintuitive mechanism for interfacing between personal devices and large displays or real\nworld objects has been demonstrated.\nFrom a technical viewpoint, the network architecture that supports remote communication\nbetween the real and virtual MetaPark visitors provides a technical challenge of significant\ncomplexity. When the system is functionally complete a more intensive period of\nevaluation will commence. In particular the authors hope to understand the relationships\nbetween the virtual and real space communities, the types of learning that occur and the\ncommunications mechanisms used. In terms of evaluation, longitudinal studies will be\nimportant in assessing the benefits of applications that sound intriguing on paper and\nmake compelling demonstrations. Such work will provide qualitative understanding of the\npractical appeal of ubiquitous telepresence, but with radically new hardware there is also\nso\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nscope for more constrained, quantitative assessment of the options in presenting and\ninteracting with wearable interfaces.\nFinally, although the first instantiation of the MetaPark concept was realized for children,\nits underlying technologies and principles are generic enough to be transferable to other\neducational groups. It relatively easy to imagine the MetaPark concept being applied, for\nexample, to field trips undertaken by university students.\nReferences\nBillinghurst, M., Bowskill, J., Jessop, M. and Morphett, J.
