Although the role\nof the instrumentalist may be very important, it is rarely that of an inventor. In\nfact it usually works the other way round. If an instrumentalist writes music for his\nown instrument, the result is often not interesting in the technical sense, for he\ntends to write something that is comfortable to perform, or to over-exploit certain\npersonal facilities. On the other hand, a non-performing composer often comes\nup with ideas that will force the player to look for new solutions on the instrument.\nLater, the composer faces the question of what is possible to perform within a\ncertain context. There may be a hundred books about writing for the cello, but\neverything is a question of context. Nobody will ever be able to list all the possible \u2013\nor impossible \u2013 ways of combining things. The performer steps in to sort out the\ninnovative from the impossible. This is the moment when the role of the performer\nis crucial, the moment of trying out new ways of approaching the instrument.1\n1 Karttunen. \u2018Discovering the Music around Me\u2019, 16\u201318. Karttunen has collaborated extensively with composers such\nas Kaija Saariaho, Tan Dun, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Luca Francesconi, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Magnus Lindberg, Paavo\nHeininen, and Jean-Luc Darbellay.\n71\nAnssi Karttunen\u2019s outline may be taken as broadly representative of the composer\u2013\nperformer relationship as it is conceived in the profession: the performer\u2019s role is usually\nconfined to the discovery of practical \u2018solutions\u2019 to musical ideas (\u2018problems\u2019) that have\nalready been posed by the composer. However, Karttunen also implicitly understands that\nwhen the \u2018solutions\u2019 offered by a composer are unworkable, the scenario becomes complex.\nThis is the point at which collaboration becomes interesting from a creative standpoint, but\nit is also where Karttunen stops. In a musical culture that has understood the performer\u2019s role\nprimarily as mediator between composer\/piece and audience, very little attention has been\npaid to the performer\u2019s potentially significant mediation between composer and piece. When\nthe latter interpretation of the role is brought into play early in the conception, the performer\nmay take a vital, inventive stance in which \u2018problems\u2019 (musical ideas) are formulated and\nreformulated in tandem with their \u2018solutions\u2019. The composer\u2013performer collaboration may\nthus become a site for the playing out of the dialogic aspects of artistic creation.\nThere are obvious reasons why this has been little discussed. On the one hand, there is a\nscarcity of source material. Most manuscript sketches trace a compositional process in which\nthe performer\u2019s role can only be implicit, although the autographs of some of the great\nnineteenth- and twentieth-century composer-performers show clear traces of an internal\n\u2018dialogue\u2019.2 Sources that document aspects of a collaboration \u2013 the autographs of the\nBrahms\u2013Joachim and Elgar\u2013Kreisler concertos, or the Chopin\u2013Franchomme Grand Duo,3\nfor example \u2013 may present a variety of alternatives but cannot document the process itself. If\nwe are to study the collaboration itself, the processive\/dialogic aspects that are of central\nimportance must be reconstructed speculatively. On the other hand, even if it were possible\nto have access to every aspect of a collaboration \u2013 via video\/audio recordings of conversations\nand workshop sessions as well as notated materials \u2013 much of what drives ideas forward is not\nexpressed directly.\nIn order to document the collaborative process we are thus more reliant on the partici-\npants themselves than we might wish.4 Not only are they likely to make unreliable witnesses,\nowing to the difficulties of recalling many conflicting strands of exploration and the necessity\nof articulating ideas that may have been latent during much of the process, they are also\nrequired to deal with complex issues of power-play, which the endemic division of musical\nscholarship into sub-disciplines has sidelined. An experiment at the Royal Academy of\nMusic, London, where Master\u2019s students from the Composition Department were encour-\naged to produce solo pieces in collaboration with performers, was abandoned after only one\nyear. Whereas the composers had already worked effectively in collaboration with artists and\nchoreographers and in ensemble contexts, the one-to-one aspect of the relationships with the\nsolo performers proved difficult. This was partly a consequence of the lack of models for\nthe ways in which such relationships might work (one of the factors that contributed to the\n2 See, for example, the various autograph manuscripts of Chopin\u2019s \u00c9tude Op. 25 no. 1, which document an experimen-\ntation with different \u2018performance solutions\u2019 to a number of passages.\n3 In the manuscript (on three staves) of the Grand Duo, the piano\u2019s material is written in Chopin\u2019s hand and the cello\u2019s\nin Franchomme\u2019s.\n4 In certain respects this is just as problematic in relation to the compositional process, in which a great deal happens\nbefore the writing stages. See Saxton, \u2018The Process of Composition from Detection to Confection\u2019.\n72 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nwriting of this paper); however, a more fundamental problem was that many of the compos-\ners expressed serious discomfort at the \u2018intrusion\u2019 of the performer into their creative space.\nAlthough reactions from the performers in this instance were less marked, the potential\nproblems are at least as serious. The immediate presence of the composer, and his literal\nembodiment of the authority traditionally associated with his position, may dissuade the\nperformer from exerting his own necessary construction of \u2018authority\u2019. A successful collab-\noration will not attempt to defuse the difficulties of the situation, which are in any case\nunavoidable, but will harness its provocative and questioning aspects. The authority of the\ncomposer is so firmly rooted in the culture of Western art music that it is hardly likely to be\nundermined by working closely with a performer; but the collaborative process does raise\nimportant questions about the ways in which we conceive authorship of music. Leaving aside\nMichel Foucault\u2019s particular analytical and cultural context, we may note that his construc-\ntion of the \u2018author concept\u2019 points, paradoxically, to some of the ways in which collaborative\nrelationships function: \u2018The author is not an indefinite source of significations that fill a\nwork; the author does not precede the works; he is a certain functional principle by which, in\nour culture, one limits, excludes and chooses.\u20195\nThis article aims to suggest a model for musicological approaches to collaborative prac-\ntice; but it also seeks to draw out the \u2018inventive\u2019 aspects of the process, and to suggest\nhow collaboration may be used to locate the creative process and frame its presentation.\nCollaboration is frequently a matter of the performer giving the composer access to his \u2018box\nof tricks\u2019, or of the composer presenting notated sketches to be tried out, adopted, discarded,\nor refined. Such pragmatic approaches may well be beneficial to both parties, but they come\nat the cost of reinforcing the boundaries inherent in their respective roles. We have felt it\nworthwhile to present an account of our work, in so far as it represents a more dynamic\nmodel of the collaborative process, in order to articulate some of the ways in which creative\npractice may be understood as research.\nThe collaborative \u2018model\u2019 presented here adopts an implicitly dialogic format as a way of\navoiding the circumscription and attenuation that a single authorial \u2018voice\u2019 would have\nimposed. The locus of our collaboration was a ten-minute piece for speaking cellist, Per\nSerafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de Panurge, written in 2002\u20133 (although the working process\nleading to its composition was rather more protracted). Our work together consisted of\ndirect discussions and workshop-style meetings, all of which were recorded on minidisc. The\npresence of a near-complete record of events might suggest that presenting it would be\nstraightforward, but this is not the case. In fact the collaborative process is very difficult to\npresent because the evolution of ideas was fundamentally non-linear. Rather than respond-\ning to a set of pre-established questions, we often found ourselves \u2018discovering\u2019 material that\nwas later understood to be the \u2018solution\u2019 to a problem or question that had not yet been\narticulated. A further fundamental difficulty is that much of our collaborative \u2018dialogue\u2019 was\nnot voiced explicitly at the time and hence is undocumented. To create space for this implicit\ndialogue and to turn our individual unreliability as witnesses to advantage, the discussion\n5 Foucault, \u2018What is an Author?\u2019 [from a talk given in 1969], 221.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 73\nthat follows is divided into composer\u2019s (FF) and performer\u2019s (NH) perspectives. Rather than\nprioritizing the \u2018actual events\u2019 of the collaboration, as traditional scholarship has tended to\ndo, we have focused attention on the different ways in which these events were understood,\nand on the ways in which conceptions intersected and overlapped. Our language is thus\nintentionally and necessarily personal at times, and we have given one another leave to\ninterject at pertinent points in each other\u2019s narratives.\nBut it would be misleading to treat the resulting piece solely as the locus of a case study,\nfirstly because the collaborative process is not an end in itself, and secondly because the\nauthors, as already noted, are (of necessity) both the reporters of the process and its only\nprotagonists. To a significant extent the modus operandi of the collaborative process is\ninscribed in the piece itself, in so far as it exploits non-linear strategies and problematizes the\nnarrative that serves as its starting point. Accordingly, Per Serafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de\nPanurge can usefully be placed within the context of the composer\u2019s preoccupations and\nworking methods. Although a composer is not necessarily best placed to provide analytical\ncommentary on a given work, focusing on the piece as end result and relating it back to the\ncollaborative process provides an additional dynamic through which to comment on both.\nPer Serafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de Panurge\nFF: COMPOSITIONAL QUESTIONS AND STRATEGIES\nPer Serafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de Panurge (henceforth PSCII) is the second part of a pro-\njected three-movement cycle (see Table 1) setting texts by, or based on, the work of Fran\u00e7ois\nRabelais (c.1483\u20131553), who himself invented, among other anagrammatic noms-de-plume,\nthe Italianate \u2018Serafino Calbarsi\u2019. The idea for this cycle (and fairly detailed sketches for Per\nSerafino Calbarsi III: Antistrophes) originated many years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until I received a\ncommission from the London-based Renaissance instrumental group Virelai in 2001 that its\ndefinitive shape emerged.6 Beyond the common derivation of the texts from Rabelais, and the\nuniformly humorous stance underlying them, the cycle is centrally concerned with the rela-\ntion between text and music. In each piece the text is of a different type: poetry in Rondeau de\nPanurge, prose in Le Songe de Panurge, and in Antistrophes a freely invented spoonerist text\nthat is neither quite the one nor quite the other. (Spoonerisms, or contrep\u00e8teries, are some-\nthing of a French national pastime. The examples in Rabelais\u2019s work, though few, are quite\nfamous, and he was apparently the first writer to give the technique a name: antistrophe.) In\neach case the relation of text and music is different: the form of PSCI is largely informed by the\ntext\u2019s poetic structure, while the spoonerisms of PSCIII give rise to a phonetic deconstruction\nof the text that constantly flirts with its \u2018forbidden\u2019 meanings. In PSCII the narrative of\nPanurge\u2019s dream (spoken by the cellist) and the music are in an ambiguous relationship (a\ndeliberate flirtation with narrative, one might say) that is constantly being re-evaluated. At\ntimes it is deliberately illustrative, while on other occasions the two appear to be moving, as it\nwere, in parallel universes in which any coincidence is fortuitous, or at any rate not causal.\n6 For details of the recording see Discography.\n74 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nAnother of the cycle\u2019s central concerns is the articulation of inherently unstable sonorities.\nThis aspect was of particular importance to the collaborative process, since it encompasses\nthe \u2018discovery\u2019 of these sonorities, the gestural vocabulary attending them, the optimal\nmanner of their notation, and, most importantly, the establishing of a framework within\nwhich these gestures and sonorities would operate. (Under these headings falls one of the\npiece\u2019s most audible peculiarities, the consistent use of scordatura \u2013 see Example 5 below.) So\nalthough they constitute the \u2018stuff \u2019 of the piece, they are more properly considered below in\nconnection with the collaborative process itself.\nText, form, structure\nLe Songe de Panurge takes its title from a \u2018dream sequence\u2019 described in Chapter 14 of\nRabelais\u2019s Tiers Livre, first published in Paris in 1546.7 The whole of the Tiers Livre is devoted\nto the problem of interpretation; for the purpose of the narrative, the immediate metaphor of\nthis activity is the divination of the future. Rabelais\u2019s anti-hero, Panurge, wishes to marry, but\nis well aware that to do so is to run the risk of being cuckolded; and much as he enjoys the\ncompany of cuckolds (and especially their wives), he has a dread fear of being among their\nnumber. In the chapters leading up to the dream sequence Panurge and Pantagruel (the latter\na figure in the mould of Plato\u2019s philosopher-ruler) attempt to foretell whether Panurge\u2019s\nhypothetical marriage might prove happy or unhappy. They do so by a number of means (for\nexample, drawing lines from Virgil at random, consulting a comic Sybil, a necromancer, a\npoet in articulo mortis, etc.) whose outcome is always the same: Panurge invariably reads\nthe omens favourably, and Pantagruel unfavourably. That Panurge\u2019s readings are always\nimplausible lends an element of comedy to the proceedings, but the underlying ambiguity\nremains. By Chapter 14 Pantagruel has advised Panurge that they might try interpreting his\ndreams; accordingly, this chapter relates the dream, as told by Panurge, and the differing\ninterpretations of it proposed by the two protagonists.\n7 The passages used in PSCII are taken from Rabelais, \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes, 371, 377, 388, 393 (the latter being the dream\nsequence); see Appendix below.\nTable 1 The Per Serafino Calbarsi cycle\nTitle Instrumentation\nPer Serafino Calbarsi I: Rondeau de Renaissance lute, Renaissance flute,\nPanurge (2002) Renaissance viol, female voice\nPer Serafino Calbarsi II: Le Songe de Speaking cellist\nPanurge (2002\u20133)\nPer Serafino Calbarsi III: Antistrophes (2007\u2013) Bass flute (speaking part), cello with\nsteel mute\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 75\nThe text occupies only about half of the piece, the last third of which is entirely instru-\nmental. Thus the work\u2019s structural armature is largely independent of the text. It consists of\na number of proportionally related sections characterized by their own metronome mark-\nings. The texted passages are for the most part confined to senza tempo sections, and are\nspoken over silence or \u2018coloured silence\u20198 consisting of drones. This pragmatic decision also\nhas the virtue of reinforcing the functional distinction between types of material, although as\nthe piece progresses that distinction becomes increasingly blurred. In the second, mostly\ntextless half of the work the metronome markings function predominantly as reference\npoints for an almost constant \u2018metronomic glissando\u2019. Throughout, the bar structures\nand their subdivisions are governed by self-sufficient, more or less ad hoc numerological\nand proportional devices. The result is a quasi-baroque mosaic structure of interlocking\nepisodes.\nTwo of these episodes are worth describing in some detail, since they comment obliquely\non the text\u2019s implied subject while standing outside the material of the piece\u2019s opening\nsection. (They also illustrate the role of the scordatura alluded to earlier.) Both are cast in the\nmould of miniature \u2018character pieces\u2019, again with reference to baroque topics. The first, \u2018Il\ncucco\u2019, which immediately precedes the recitation of Panurge\u2019s dream, consists of twelve\niterations of a pair of harmonics on adjacent strings, interspersed with silences (see Example\n1). These twelve iterations are subdivided into three groups of three, five, and four, each with\nits own pair of bars, one for the notes, one for the silence. In each pair the proportion between\nthe two bars is nearly identical, and the numerators and denominators in each pair of time\nsignatures are the product of the same cross-multiplication (by 4). While the distinction\nbetween the pairs of bars, and hence the perceptible difference between them, is so infini-\ntesimal as to seem wilfully perverse, the change of perspective for the performer is crucial in\nmaintaining the tension throughout the section. (The deliberate perverseness of the notation\nhere is in keeping with the material\u2019s comic reference to the cuckoo (old French: cocu), the\nhabitual emblem of cuckoldry.)\nThe second \u2018character piece\u2019, \u2018Les Cloches\u2019, intervenes midway through the dream\nsequence proper, and is itself intercut with the text (which, for once, occurs in a measured\nsection). It comprises a series of double-stops in natural harmonics (see Example 2). Here,\nthe sum of the numerators of each pair of adjacent bars is always a prime, while the\nsubdivision employed in each bar is either identical with, or proportionally related to, the\nnumerator of the other bar of each pair. As the piece progresses, the relationship between\ngesture, notation, and sounding result is further problematized. The materials themselves\nbecome increasingly disembodied and unstable, their relation to the physical gestures\nrequired to produce them becomes increasingly counter-intuitive, and their notation is ever\nmore removed from the sounding result. The simultaneous use of the scordatura, microtonal\nstopped-notes, pizzicatos both in front and behind stopped notes, and the occasional\nintroduction of tablature combine to destabilize the piece\u2019s initial pitch-structures to the\npoint of dissolving them altogether.\n8 On the use of this term see Ferneyhough, \u2018Second String Quartet (1982)\u2019, 122\u20133.\n76 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nExample 3 shows three brief but typical instances: in (a) a run up the fingerboard in\nequidistant physical increments across three successive strings creates microtonal deviations;\nin (b) tablature notation is used, with the notes on all the three strings remaining fixed (here,\nthe bow pressure is such that all three strings may be played at once: but see the passage below\non the so-called \u2018killer double-stop\u2019); and in (c) a combination of tablature (on the lower\nstave) and glissandos with pizzicatos on either side of a string (upper stave) creates a\nparticularly concentrated gestural experience for the performer. The calibration of pitch\nrelationships at these moments, along with the sections using the so-called \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger\neffect\u2019 (on which, see below), were among the passages involving the most intensive work in\nboth collaborative and compositional terms. At the same time, the correct notation of their\nphysical gestures resulted in a correspondingly deliberate over-notation. The \u2018metronomic\nglissando\u2019 overlaying the bar structure mirrors the fluidity and instability of the materials, so\nthat the \u2018gravitational centre\u2019 two-thirds into the piece (when the spoken material ceases)\ndissipates entirely. This final process of dissipation derives its expressive effect from the\ndramatic framework set up earlier in the work. That framework itself results from specific\nExample 1 Le Songe de Panurge, \u2018Il cucco\u2019, bb. 34\u201356.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 77\ndecisions relating to the interaction of text and music. As we will show, these decisions played\na crucial role in the early stages of our collaboration \u2013 so much so that, from our standpoint\nat least, any further discussion of the work is of necessity bound up with this process of\nlimiting, excluding, and choosing.\nExample 2 Le Songe de Panurge, \u2018Les Cloches\u2019, bb. 59\u201368.\n78 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nThe Collaborative Process: Genesis\nNH: INITIAL DISCUSSIONS\nFrom my perspective, the beginning of the collaboration can be traced to a typical composer\u2013\nperformer conversation. I had been asked to proofread the parts of Fabrice\u2019s chamber work\nFiligranes pour les fr\u00e8res Limbourg (1989\u201392) prior to a recording made by Ensemble Expos\u00e9\nExample 3 Le Songe de Panurge, (a) b. 73, (b) b. 80, (c) b. 101.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 79\nof London in 1999, in which the cello part was to be played by another musician.9 Much of\nthe discussion was unremarkable, but one issue triggered a conversation, of which the\nramifications are central to PSCII. Fabrice had written the natural harmonic shown as\nExample 4(a) several times. In some of the contexts in which it appeared the harmonic was\ninherently dangerous: there was a significant probability of it either not sounding at all, or\nsounding incorrectly. The obvious suggestion from a performer\u2019s standpoint was to replace\nthe \u2018problematic\u2019 C-string natural harmonic with the same pitch produced as the third\nharmonic on the G-string (see Example 4(b)). This is not only far more reliable, but also\ncapable of being produced with a much greater dynamic range. However, this alternative\nharmonic was also the more obvious of the two possibilities, so it seemed likely that Fabrice\nhad rejected it in favour of the more complex solution.\nBefore talking to Fabrice I had thus posed one of the central questions of the implicit\ncomposer\u2013performer dialogue: \u2018What could have been the motivation for this choice?\u2019\nPlayers might often describe the two alternatives in terms of \u2018better\u2019 (G-string) and \u2018worse\u2019\n(C-string) sounds, but the key differences between them ought not to imply value judge-\nments. The C-string harmonic is qualitatively \u2018tighter\u2019, owing to both the greater thickness of\nthe string and the greater density of harmonic nodes (limiting the amplitude of vibration).\nFrom a psychological perspective the impression could be described as more distant,\nand indeed the more \u2018complex\u2019 the harmonic, the further removed the sound is from the\nnatural resonance of the instrument. It seemed plausible, then, that the C-string harmonic\nhad been chosen because it sounded less \u2018free\u2019 than the alternative, so our discussion\nworked outwards from that possibility. (I had at this stage \u2018prepared\u2019 a third solution \u2013 shown\nas Example 4(c) \u2013 that managed to combine some of the attributes of both natural\nharmonics.)\nI recall very little of our conversation, and nothing of the \u2018solution\u2019 eventually chosen;\nhowever, I do remember the way in which our discussion of one set of \u2018problems\u2019 raised\nissues that generated new areas for exploration. This was typical of the collaboration that\nfollowed. The qualitative difference between the alternative harmonics may or may not have\nbeen significant in Filigranes. The important discovery was that both Fabrice and I were keen\nto explore the potential of the different properties of these sorts of harmonics in more depth.\nThis was an opportunity to draw out and give substance to all kinds of latent possibilities that\nI recognized in my instrument. My desire to work with Fabrice was motivated in part by his\nobvious fascination with the qualitative differences of sounds, but more importantly by a\n9 For details of the recording see Discography.\nExample 4 Alternative harmonics.\n80 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nsense that he would be able to conceptualize a \u2018new\u2019 music that would grow out of them. It\nwas already obvious from my experience as an improviser that writing anything that explored\nthese subtle timbral possibilities was going to present many problems, not least finding ways\nto turn the inherent fragility and instability of some of the \u2018distant\u2019 harmonics to advantage.\nFabrice had been Brian Ferneyhough\u2019s student some years ago, and as I had been\nimmersed in Ferneyhough\u2019s Time and Motion Study II (1973\u20136), I made an observation\nabout the extraordinary richness of its timbral conception of material. In this context I\nexpressed a disappointment \u2013 from a \u2018fetishistic\u2019 perspective \u2013 that the grand sweep of\nFerneyhough\u2019s argument is so compelling that the details are easily missed. Although it did\nnot occur to me at the time, it was clear in retrospect that the music I imagined coming out\nof our collaboration might be a \u2018negative image\u2019 of the Ferneyhough along the lines of\nNietzsche\u2019s \u2018miniaturist\u2019 Wagner of 1888:\nWagner begins from a hallucination \u2013 not of sounds but of gestures. Then he seeks\nthe sign language of sounds for them. If one would admire him, one should watch\nhim at work at this point: how he separates, how he gains small units, how he\nanimates these, severs them, and makes them visible. [. . .] Wagner is admirable\nand gracious only in the invention of what is smallest, in spinning out the details.\nHere one is entirely justified in proclaiming him a master of the first rank, as our\ngreatest miniaturist in music who crowds into the smallest space an infinity of\nsense and sweetness. His wealth of colours, of half-shadows, of the secrecies of\ndying light spoils one to such an extent that afterward almost all other musicians\nseem too robust.10\nFF: A PIECE IN SEARCH OF A CELLIST\nMany years before the discussion just mentioned, out of which the idea of a collaboration\narose, I\u2019d already conceived of a piece for solo cello having the title Le Songe de Panurge.\nAlthough at the time I\u2019d had a strong \u2018auratic\u2019 image in mind, the shape the piece would take,\nthe precise materials it would use, and how it would articulate the text at its centre were\nquestions whose resolution were deliberately postponed until an opportunity arose of\nworking in depth with a cellist. Our discussions around harmonics having opened up\nprecisely the field of exploration I\u2019d been seeking to articulate, there was from the start an\nimplicit understanding of the issues that would inform our investigations.\nFrom the outset we recognized the central role of Rabelais\u2019s text, for the basic issues\ninforming our initial discussions closely tessellated with the reasons that had attracted me to\nthis text in the first place. The chapter\u2019s very title (\u2018Le Songe de Panurge, et interpretation\nd\u2019icelluy\u2019) suggests the idea of multiple, displaced, or contradictory readings of a given \u2018fact\u2019:\nthere is, on the one hand, the dream as Panurge relates it (already a form of displacement),\nand, on the other, the different interpretations it elicits from Panurge and Pantagruel\n(described immediately after the dream sequence itself). So the question of multiple\nreadings, of d\u00e9doublement, which is present on several levels, mirrors the questions we wished\n10 Nietzsche. The Birth of Tragedy and The Case of Wagner, 170\u20131 (emphasis original).\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 81\nto explore: on a conceptual level, the relationship between notation and sound; from the\nperformance standpoint, the relationship between instrumental gesture (in the mechanical\nsense) and sounding result, notably the creation of situations in which the traditional\nrelationship between the two is set on its head; and finally, on an acoustic level, the\narticulation of sounds whose principal feature is instability, either in terms of the sonority\nitself, or in its production. (Inherent in these sounds is a certain risk of execution in live\nperformance.) All of these aims would probably have been agreed upon irrespective of\nRabelais\u2019s text, because, once again, the concerns they articulate already constituted\ncommon ground. At the same time, the Rabelais provided a concrete point of reference.\nSuch a point of reference was crucial, because much of the initial exploration was anything\nbut concrete. Rather, the topics mentioned above were largely agreed upon before the cello\nwas ever taken out of its case; conversely, the form they would take, or better, the ways in\nwhich they would be articulated, were largely unknown when we started. In fact, even those\naspects of the piece that might strike the observer as obvious were conditioned by the\ncollaborative process. Panurge\u2019s dream was in this sense a yardstick against which the\nappropriateness of specific techniques or strategies could be gauged.\nNH: From the outset it was the potential rhetorical significance of the presence of the text\nrather than its content that occupied my attention, although the idea of speaking Rabelais in\nthis context was also appealing. The historical decontextualization that the parallel strata of\ntext and music perform on one another seemed to have the potential to be a very effective way\nof questioning, and even challenging, the listener.\nFF: Another fixed point of reference, albeit one from which a certain distance had to be\nmaintained, was Brian Ferneyhough\u2019s Time and Motion Study II for solo cello and live\ntransformation. The piece has been in Neil\u2019s repertory for some time, but at the start of our\ncollaboration he mentioned that he was about to take it up anew, and we agreed that PSCII\nmight be conceived as a companion piece. For both technical and aesthetic reasons,Time and\nMotion Study II is a problematic work to programme in concerts. My own interest in\nFerneyhough\u2019s music suggested that it might indeed be fruitful to conceive of the work as a\nfoil to Ferneyhough\u2019s, specifically from the perspective of live performance. In any case, some\nof the parallels arose quite naturally, again as a result of my chosen text: the nightmarish,\noppressive world of Time and Motion Study II is echoed in Panurge\u2019s dream, from which he\nwakes in a cold sweat (\u2018en sursault me resveiglai, tout fasch\u00e9, indign\u00e9, et perplex\u2019). Similarly,\nthe problematization of notation and gesture vis-\u00e0-vis the sounding result is common to\nboth works, as is some of the basic musical material, namely the long held notes (electro-\nacoustically extended in Ferneyhough) and an extended passage executed without the bow.\nEven the harsh, physically jarring sonority that closes Ferneyhough\u2019s piece is mirrored in the\nlong episode at bb. 75\u201382, which we came to refer to as the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019. At the same\ntime, PSCII is entirely acoustic, and its deliberate flirtations with both humour and narrative\nare very much its own.\n82 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nOther proximate influences will be mentioned later; having described the very opening\nstages of the collaboration, we can explore the manner in which work unfolded, again from\nour individual perspectives.\nThe Collaborative Process in Action\nFF: THE ROLE OF (CONTROLLED) ACCIDENT\nMuch of our preliminary exploration was a matter of \u2018inventing\u2019 (in the original, Latin\nmeaning of the word \u2013 \u2018discovering\u2019) a sound world whose ethics were implicit in our initial\npremises. In some cases an initial idea was refined until it reached its definitive state: thus, the\nfinal scordatura (in which the pitch e2 is present as a different partial on all four strings)\nexisted first in an approximate state (see Example 5).\nOnly when it was realized how closely its harmonics conglomerated around e2 was the\ndecision taken to use this pitch as the reference point for tuning the scordatura. (This\nrepresents a reversal of the spectralist position whereby the four strings are tuned as partials\nof a common fundamental.) The fact that the same reference pitch ensures the accurate\ntuning of a fiercely untempered scordatura in turn suggested the piece\u2019s opening gambit,\nwherein the cellist gradually moves from the initial scordatura to the definitive one, tuning\none string at a time, as happens before any performance when a string player tunes up. The\npiece\u2019s opening sectional title, \u2018Recercar\u2019,11 refers to the original meaning of the term, the\ninstrumentalist\u2019s practice of recercare lo tono, which can be taken literally in the sense of\ntuning up, \u2018searching\u2019 for the \u2018correct\u2019 tuning (see Example 6).\nThe implications of the scordatura in turn precipitated decisions regarding form and\nmaterial. I\u2019ve pointed out how the idea of a tuning being arrived at gradually suggested the\nmaterial at the beginning of the piece. The very fact that the tuning-up process is incorpor-\nated into the piece itself serves as a framing device, pointing to the theatrical ambiguity of the\nsituation. (We\u2019ve all had the unsettling experience, when attending a live performance of a\ncontemporary string work, of wondering whether the tuning has stopped, or the piece proper\nhas begun.) In any case, this framing device helped me to resolve a crucial problem: the\nsetting of Rabelais\u2019s text. The idea of introducing a spoken element of a decidedly narrative\n11 I have adopted the Venetian spelling of the word used in the first edition of Girolamo Frescobaldi\u2019s Fiori musicali\n(Venice: Vincenti, 1635). Frescobaldi is also invoked in the second sectional title, \u2018Il cucco\u2019, a reference to his\ncapriccio on this two-note soggetto.\nExample 5 Scordature, (a) initial, and (b) final.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 83\nbent was suggested by Marin Marais\u2019s Tableau de l\u2019op\u00e9ration de la taille, which simul-\ntaneously narrates and \u2018illustrates\u2019 the procedure of a gallstone operation;12 but where the\nrelation between music and text\/narrative is intended to be descriptive or analogical with\n12 It should be noted that it is unclear whether Marais intended the text (which is notated directly above the relevant\nmusic) to be spoken by the performer.\nExample 6 Le Songe de Panurge, \u2018Recercar\u2019, bb. 2\u201310.\n84 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nMarais, in Le Songe de Panurge it aims to be anything but. On the contrary, I was seeking a\nsolution that would create as much ambiguity as possible: Is the music meant to accompany\nthe narrative, or does it serve a critical (interpretative) function? Or is the music itself the\nobject of interpretation? The framing device of tuning up to the scordatura in turn suggested\nthe incorporation of previous chapter headings leading up to the dream. By their very nature\nthese chapter headings function as framing devices within Rabelais\u2019s work, summarizing the\nnarrative while remaining outside it; here, they frame the narrative of the dream-sequence\nbut are themselves framed by the music that surrounds them. The two framing systems run\nin parallel, so that the final chapter heading (that of Chapter 14 itself) coincides with the\narrival at the definitive scordatura. The fact that such strategies evolved as a result of the\ncollaborative process is inscribed, in the case of the last example, within the piece itself.\nAnother consequence of the scordaturawas discovered, as it were, by \u2018accident\u2019. (The \u2018as it\nwere\u2019 is important, because we were mostly dealing with controlled accidents arising out of\nthe initial premises within which we were working.) With the question of the final scordatura\ndefinitively settled, I asked Neil to try out as many harmonic double-stops as we could think\nof. We had in mind here the notion of d\u00e9doublement, which takes on a particular relevance\nbecause the tuning relationship between the three pairs of adjacent strings is different in each\ncase \u2013 hence the great variety of sonorities available as harmonics, whereas the natural tuning\ngives relatively few. In the process of going through the available combinations, we stumbled\nupon the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019 (third partial on the fourth string, second partial on the third\nstring \u2013 see Example 7), a sound so dissonant that surrounding objects began to rattle in\nstrong sympathetic vibration. The reason is that the two pitches lie in the range of the cello\u2019s\nwolf-tone, which is further excited by the beats created between them.\nAnother far-reaching accidental discovery concerns what we call the \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger effect\u2019.\nDuring this particular session we were working on the idea of simultaneous pizzicato on both\nsides of the string. By its very nature, the \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger effect\u2019 occurs when the player fails to\nstop the finger from hitting the adjacent string after executing the plucking action (see\nExample 8 below). What we would never have predicted is that the pitch produced on the\nadjacent string varies according to the point at which the main string is plucked. Thus we had\na perfect acoustic embodiment of d\u00e9doublement: immediately after the main pizzicato you\nhear another, much softer, percussive sound, one that shadows the principal sound but has\nthe potential of pitch mobility independently of the main note, hence the name we gave the\ntechnique. It goes without saying that this movement is very confusing for the performer,\nsince the direction of the sounding result often bears no relation (or rather, the opposite\nrelation) to the gesture being executed.\nExample 7 Killer double-stop\u2019 (b. 75).\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 85\nThe term \u2018accident\u2019 in the sense that I use it here requires further qualification. Fortuitous\nas these discoveries were, the conditions out of which they arose \u2013 both the immediate\ntechnical conditions and the rationale underlying them, the \u2018how\u2019 and the \u2018why\u2019 \u2013 had been\ncarefully thought through (hence \u2018controlled accidents\u2019). By the same token, the discoveries\nhad a far-reaching impact on the piece, in that they shaped the final form the piece took. To\nbe more specific: the sonorities themselves suggested the formal and expressive context in\nwhich they might take place. To illustrate this point: in his first interview with David\nSylvester, the painter Francis Bacon describes a particular experience he had in creating one\nof his most famous works,Painting 1946: \u2018I was attempting to make a bird alighting on a field.\nExample 8 \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger effect\u2019: (a) execution; (b) notation, b. 99.\n86 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nAnd it may have been bound up in some way with the three forms that had gone before, but\nsuddenly the lines I\u2019d drawn suggested something totally different, and out of that suggestion\narose the picture.\u201913 Such an epiphany is not unlike my own feeling at certain points of our\nexplorations. For example, the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019, as described above, was discovered\naccidentally, in the sense that we had been searching not for any \u2018special effect\u2019 but for the\nmost effective sequences of multiple harmonics. The experience of the \u2018sound object\u2019 was so\npowerful, however, as to suggest solutions to specific formal problems that were still\nunresolved at that point. Bacon himself comments on the fact that \u2018one tone, one piece of\npaint [. . .] completely changes the implications of the image\u2019.14 Almost from the moment we\ndiscovered it, the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019 assumed the role of the piece\u2019s primary centre of\ngravity. Having said that, it was some time before its formal implications were entirely clear\nto me: in the provisional (or fragmentary) first version of the work premiered at the\nUniversity of Durham\u2019s Ferneyhough Festival in January 2003, the double-stop concluded\nthe fragment and consisted of a single, held dyad, with no rhythmic articulation. There was\na hiatus of several months between the first version and the composition of the final version,\nduring which time we realized that this double-stop could serve as a springboard for the rest\nof the piece, following the cellist\u2019s enunciation of the \u2018dream sequence\u2019.\nRetrospectively, that nine-month hiatus was crucial. Although the January 2003 version\nhad always been regarded as provisional (the intention being to present something to Brian\nFerneyhough on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday), the formal problem posed by the\ncontinuation of the piece beyond the end of the spoken section was one that had not been\nsatisfactorily resolved by that point. For all the obvious impact of the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019,\nseveral further working sessions were necessary before its relation to the rest of the piece\nbecame clear. Arguably, such \u2018stock-taking\u2019 would not have been necessary had the materials\nnot been discovered accidentally: their very unfamiliarity posed the problem (\u2018how to\nincorporate them?\u2019) of which they are themselves the answer. For this reason, in considering\nthe question of the \u2018controlled accident\u2019, the emphasis must be placed on both \u2018accident\u2019 and\n\u2018control\u2019 in equal measure.\nNH: REVISIONS\nAs has been mentioned, part of PSCII was given a public hearing at Durham University\u2019s\ncelebration of Brian Ferneyhough\u2019s sixtieth birthday, in a programme that also included the\nlatter\u2019s Time and Motion Study II. This early version of PSCII (approximately half the\nduration of the final composition) is, viewing it retrospectively, an interesting staging post\nfor the development of the notational aspects of the work; however, the material revisions,\nwhich consisted of substantial re-compositions, and which might traditionally form the\nsource material for discussion of the genesis of a piece, are perhaps less interesting. (The\nrelevant passages are the bars leading to the retuning of the fourth string \u2013 bb. 28\u201330 \u2013 and the\nsections entitled \u2018Il cucco\u2019 and \u2018Les Cloches\u2019.) The most striking notational difference in the\n13 Sylvester, The Brutality of Fact, 11.\n14 Sylvester, The Brutality of Fact, 18. The role of accident and chance is a central concern throughout the first two\nBacon\u2013Sylvester interviews, done in 1962 and 1966, respectively. See also Sylvester, 121.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 87\nearlier version is that the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019 is indicated at sounding pitch. In the final\nversion the passage is much expanded, but from the outset the notation clearly indicates the\ngestural importance of the section. This apparent refinement of focus in the notation\nindicates a fundamental shift of perception about the way in which the piece as a whole\nworks, and our discussions at this point frequently returned to the notion of \u2018centres of\ngravity\u2019.\nThe other changes, though possibly more interesting from a purely compositional stand-\npoint, seem less significant because they represent \u2018improvements\u2019 of material that was felt to\nhave been less successful than it could have been in performance. This is, of course, the\nnormal business of collaboration, but as we had already worked together extensively there\nwere no real surprises here. Many of the \u2018improvements\u2019 were simply the consequence of\nre-evaluating workshop sessions (though usually without revisiting them). In fact, in the case\nof the \u2018cucco\u2019 material the final version is an exact return to something we had experimented\nwith much earlier in the process. The more complex version \u2018premiered\u2019 in 2003 was the\nconsequence of a feeling that something \u2018unique\u2019 was needed to make the section come alive.\nIt was rejected in part because it didn\u2019t sound as interesting as we had hoped it might, but also\nbecause of a growing awareness that in the context of the whole structure the simpler version\nwas gesturally more appropriate.\nDuring the nine months between the premiere of the first version and the time when we\nbegan to work together on the piece again, many possibilities for continuation presented\nthemselves. It had seemed obvious to both of us that the \u2018beginning\u2019 both warranted and\ndemanded an extensive continuation (or perhaps an \u2018interpretation\/analysis\u2019 of the dream?).\nNevertheless, I was surprised at our next workshop session to hear Fabrice asking about a\ntechnique we had stumbled upon, \u2018named\u2019, and then left aside. This was the \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger\neffect\u2019 (discussed above) \u2013 perhaps the only device in the piece that has no technical\nprecedent. Its discovery had been entirely fortuitous, resulting from an exploration of the\nvariety of pizzicatos that could be produced using both ends of the string and two hands\nunencumbered by a bow. Almost immediately we had found it, it was given an identity\nthrough its name. I recall recognizing its possible ramifications from the perspectives of\n\u2018doublings\u2019 we had discussed, and seized on the idea of a \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger\u2019 almost ironically. As\nso often happens in practical contexts, the initial name stuck. The problem at our meeting\nwas that, although I could recall the \u2018conceptual\u2019 aspect of the original discovery and could\nroughly remember the aural result, I had no recollection of how it was achieved technically.\nMuch time was wasted attempting to rediscover it, and Fabrice did his best to describe what\nhe remembered of its gestural \u2018appearance\u2019. In fact it was only afterwards \u2013 having heard our\nearlier session played back over the telephone \u2013 that I managed to stumble on it again, in the\nmidst of an improvisatory exploration of material (much as the initial session had been). The\nproblem of rediscovery had been that the device is fundamentally counter-intuitive, and was\nthus unlikely to be found by searching for it. (The audibility of the string that is not plucked\nis only possible because of the way the surrounding vibrational possibilities are damped.)\nThis seems a remarkable example of the discovery of a \u2018solution\u2019 to the \u2018problems\u2019 of\nconveying the idea of \u2018doubling\u2019, and of finding a way to develop the implications of the\n88 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\ndouble sound produced by finger percussion before the problems themselves had been fully\narticulated.\nAspects of Notation\nFF: SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES\nOne of the most pressing topics of investigation was the relation of notation and sound, in\nthat notation is the starting point for an interpretation of the sounds it encodes. Throughout\nthe score the role of notation is constantly problematized. It ranges from the illustrative\n(including the incorporation of Augenmusik elements) to the gnomic, and from the close\nadherence of the notation to the sounding result to the virtual divorce of the two. This draws\non the position of so-called \u2018new complexity\u2019 in relation to notation, but also on the much\nolder distinction between analogical notation and tablature. The mobility assumed by the\nnotation offers different interpretations of the \u2018object\u2019 it represents. As an example, in the\nunmeasured sections (usually involving speech) it is usually the sounding pitches that are\nindicated, whereas in most of the measured music some form of tablature is employed (the\nmost simple manifestation being the notation of harmonics).\nFrom the collaborative standpoint it is worth observing that specific (that is, local)\nnotational strategies usually followed the discovery of the specific techniques and sonorities\nthey represent. These result in the use of up to three staves, two for the actions of each hand\nand one for the sounding pitches that occur wherever these fail to coincide with the written\npitch.\nNH: \u2018GESTURAL NOTATION\u2019\nMy concerns with the notational strategies of the piece were twofold. On the one hand, it was\nvital that the conceptual underpinnings of the piece should not be obscured, and, on the\nother, we needed practical strategies for conveying new techniques and dealing with a\ndangerously obfuscatory scordatura. As notational issues needed to be resolved long before\nsome of the conceptual aspects of the piece were clear to me, it would seem obvious that my\nattention would have been focused on the purely practical dimension, but this was not the\ncase. Because of the complex relationships between the playing techniques, the scordatura,\nand the evolution of the pitch material of the piece, there were many instances where no clear\nsolution to the notational problem existed. In fact the notational \u2018problem\u2019 had to be\narticulated clearly in order to propose a \u2018solution\u2019 that would be acceptable. Because much of\nthe piece uses harmonics, which even without scordatura are generally notated as a form of\ntablature, and because the scordatura magnifies the visual distortion\/disjunction between\nnotation and sounding result, the difficulties are much greater than might have been\nanticipated. (The use of pizzicato, plus the \u2018finger percussion\u2019 that makes the strings on both\nsides of the finger sound, as well as the additional \u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger\u2019 device, all amplify the\nproblem many times over.) To avoid potential confusion it was decided early on that\nsounding pitches should be notated outside the stave. This allowed the possibility of\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 89\nshifting between tablature-like notation and the usual \u2018sounding\u2019 or \u2018playing\u2019 options for\nscordatura.15\nAlmost all of the harmonics were notated in the traditional manner, ignoring the\nscordatura (that is, as played). There were few options here that did not risk confusing the\nperformer unduly. However, Fabrice had notated b. 58 (a succession of harmonics on e2) at\nsounding pitch, with an indication of the strings to be used above the stave. This seemed an\nappropriate solution because the groundwork establishing the means of production had\nbeen extensively prepared over the preceding pages. I was struck by the way in which the\n\u2018simpler\u2019 notation allowed attention to be focused on the spoken text, and the remainder of\nthe piece was worked out according to a system of gestural priority: \u2018played\u2019 notation was\nnormally given precedence because the notated gesture is more closely analogous with the\nperformative one, even though the pitch relationships may be obscured.\nBecause some of the problems were new to me, I sought feedback from a number of\nstudents concerning their response to the notation; and although the difficulties of dealing\nwith the complexity of the material were obvious, at least I had confirmation that the\nnotation made practical sense. There remains a strong argument that an entirely different\nscore, presenting all of the material at sounding pitch, would also be valuable, although I\nno longer have any desire to see the piece in that form. In fact, the gestural quality of the\nnotation is now so firmly embedded in my consciousness that it seems a vital part of\nthe piece\u2019s identity. As Fabrice has observed, the piece was to a large extent \u2018discovered\u2019 at the\ninstrument, and the dominant \u2018playing\u2019 notation keeps that relationship open.\nPost-Collaboration\nNH: PREPARATIONS AND PERFORMANCES\nIn many respects the most important parts of my work on the piece as a performer are still\nonly beginning. Aspects of the large-scale control of gesture, and impressions of space and\ncontinuity that have been central concerns to Fabrice from the earliest stages of composition,\nonly became of primary significance to me at the time of the first performances. Because of\nthe extended silences and the difficulties in negotiating the delivery of the text in relation to\nthe musical material, the possibilities and problems that present themselves in different\nperformance environments are perhaps more varied than usual. There is only so much that\ncan be done to prepare the way a piece will \u2018feel\u2019 when under the spotlight, and despite the\napparent complexity of the notation this piece is as subject to transformation as any other. In\nfact the long pauses and the importance of the speech elements intensify the primacy of the\nperformance over the notation or preparation.\nAs to the preparation itself, I had to spend little time rediscovering the pitch material,\nbecause much had been worked out in tandem; however, a great deal of time was spent\n15 Kod\u00e1ly\u2019s Sonata Op. 8 for solo cello (1915) uses a \u2018playing\u2019 notation throughout, whereas Sculthorpe\u2019s Requiem for\nsolo cello (1979) is written as it sounds. The general rule of thumb for choosing between the two seems to have been\nwhether or not the retuned strings are used for complex material. If not, the \u2018sounding\u2019 option is usually preferred.\n90 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\nlearning how to \u2018control\u2019 some of the fragile and unstable material (to the extent that the\ninstability sounds intentional), and in internalizing the rhythmic dimension. Although I\nhave played \u2013 and continue to play \u2013 a significant number of pieces with very complex\nnotation, I still need to be convinced every time that the notational complexity is warranted,\nnot in terms of sounding result, which is all but impossible to justify, but as a means of\ncommunication. I implicitly trusted Fabrice, but remained concerned for some time that the\nnotation might be more effective if the rhythmic dimension were simplified. Although I\nthought a lot about this, I didn\u2019t discuss it with Fabrice for fear of getting in the way. If it still\ndidn\u2019t seem justified to me at the end of the process, it could be dealt with then.\nRather than seeking an explanation of the rhythmic aspects of the piece from Fabrice, I set\nabout seeing whether I could justify it for myself. It seemed to me that the rhythmic notation\nin much of the first part of the piece is designed to perform a primarily rhetorical role. At the\nbeginning (bb. 2\u201329) it articulates the interplay between the timbrally different harmonics,\nand suggests a \u2018searching\u2019 or \u2018tension\u2019 that the timbral and pitch differentiation could not do\non their own. The \u2018esoteric\u2019 nature of the notation follows through the implication of the\nsectional subheading \u2013 \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 but the rhythmic complexity also provides a complemen-\ntary \u2018performance instruction\u2019 that reinforces the necessary \u2018difficulty\u2019 of the material.\nDuring the \u2018cuckoo\u2019 section (bb. 34\u201356) the bizarre (and conceptually difficult) changes of\ntime signature keep the performer\u2019s focus on the relation between the \u2018calls\u2019 and the silence,\ninvesting the section with an immediacy that the repetitions might otherwise undermine. (In\nthis context \u2018immediacy\u2019 indicates a sense of experiencing the music moment by moment\nrather than as architecture.) The later sections, though no less complex rhythmically, more\nclearly demand this complexity to explore the material. This ties in with the suggestion of the\ntext that the later sections of the piece \u2018interpret\u2019 the latent\/implicit aspects of the dream, and\nhence also the earlier musical material.\nIn the course of preparing the early performances Fabrice made a number of observations\nand suggestions of the sort that often play an important role in performance traditions, but\nwhich would not normally make their way into print. Given that Fabrice has actively\nwithheld these \u2018additional instructions\u2019 from the score, it is necessary that they are reported\nsecond hand. On the one hand, much of what was said was to clarify the physical or rhetorical\nimpact of certain gestures. For example, the pitch \u2018bends\u2019 around the open A-string (bb. 19\nff.) were originally marked \u2018alla Hendrix\u2019; and the passages at bb. 71\u20133 and at the very end\nwere described as \u2018disappearing down a plughole\u2019. The gesture accompanying \u2018Exceptez\u2019 was\ndescribed as \u2018nasty\u2019, and I was counselled to avoid a \u2018climactic\u2019 recitation of \u2018Me flattoit, me\nchatouilloit\u2019 etc. Fabrice also drew my attention to the importance of the \u2018Alla zanzarra\u2019\nheading near the end as an explicit performance instruction, and to the ways in which the\nmaterial and performance instruction of bb. 80 ff. recall the end of Ferneyhough\u2019s Time and\nMotion Study II. Perhaps because these observations were directly voiced in relation to my\nneeds or failings as a performer, their importance seems much greater than many of the\ndetails notated in the score.\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 91\nFF: The inclusion of these \u2018informal\u2019 instructions here is something about which a composer\nmight have mixed feelings. On the one hand, they are indications of how the composer might\napproach these passages, but is the fact that they aren\u2019t in the score a suggestion that they\nneedn\u2019t be considered definitive? Or is their inclusion a tacit admission that the notation on\nits own is insufficient to convey the expressive intention? Whatever the case, it seems to go\nagainst the spirit of dialogue to ask Neil to suppress them.\nSome Conclusions (FF and NH)\n\u2018Re-inventing the cello\u2019\nIn the process recounted above, the role of the scordatura can hardly be exaggerated, for it is\nthrough the changed pitch and acoustic relationships that most of the sounds used in the\npiece (the drones in particular) acquire their \u2018specific gravity\u2019. Acoustically speaking, the\nstrings\u2019 shared partial probably explains why the instrument resonates as richly as it does;\nwhereas most scordature seem to amplify certain characteristics of the instrument at the\nexpense of others (that is, when they do not result in an actual reduction of the overall sound),\nthis one deepens and broadens the cello\u2019s resonance, with little perceptible loss anywhere in\nits range. Similarly, many of the harmonic relationships explored throughout (specifically\nthe 8ve and near-8ve relationships) would be impossible otherwise.\nNaturally, this attitude toward the instrument has precedents. The most pertinent\nexample for the purposes of this discussion, and a composer who has given much thought to\nthe role of the instrument in music (the \u2018instrument-function\u2019, so to speak), is Helmut\nLachenmann. In an article from 1986, \u2018\u00dcber das Komponieren\u2019, he argues that \u2018composing\n[can be taken to mean] building an instrument\u2019,16 an idea he develops in many other places\nin his published writings. By this he means that the compositional process entails the\nbuilding of \u2018an imaginary instrument\u2019, the exploration of whose properties (by the com-\nposer) brings about the piece itself. Although Lachenmann deliberately situates the concept\non an abstract level (since the instrument is, after all, \u2018imaginary\u2019), its practical implications\nare manifest in the term by which he designates his own compositional practice, musique\nconcr\u00e8te instrumentale, which entails the invention of so-called \u2018extended techniques\u2019 incor-\nporating noise-based and other sonorities. So Lachenmann clearly regards the organological\ntransformative ploys necessary to bring them about as integral to the compositional process.\nIn the case of PSCII, for example, the \u2018invention\u2019 of the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019 suggested a\ncontext whereby that sound could be incorporated into the work: the \u2018new\u2019 instrument\nbegets the work. Taking Lachenmann\u2019s ideas into the collaborative context, one can observe\nthe blurring of traditionally clear lines of demarcation between performer and composer.\nMost obviously, the composer becomes, according to Lachenmann, not only an organolo-\ngist, but also an instrumentalist (albeit on an imaginary instrument). But the converse is also\n16 In Lachenmann,Musik als existentielle Erfahrung, 73\u201382. The original German phrase reads: \u2018Komponieren hei\u00dft: ein\nInstrument bauen\u2019 (77).\n92 Fitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention\ntrue: in the process of reshaping the instrument, the performer takes on some of the\nattributes of the composer in Lachenmann\u2019s model. This would seem particularly true in the\ncase of the present collaboration, in which the performer has taken an equal role in defining\nthe \u2018problems\u2019 we have made it our task to solve.\nFF: Perhaps this inflected view of the role of each participant helps to explain a curious\npersonal sentiment concerning the piece at the end of the process. For the composer,\nparadoxically, there is no doubt that the piece in its final form would be unthinkable without\nthe input of this particular performer. At the same time, I am equally certain that the piece\nconcretizes very precisely those sensations or impressions (admittedly as inchoate as they\nwere vivid) experienced when the idea for this piece first arose many years ago.\nInvention as research\nOur collaboration was perhaps unusual in a professional context, in that we worked slowly\nand there were long gaps between our meetings. Curiously, this gave the work an improvi-\nsatory aspect: nothing was too fixed in advance of our sessions, and there was sufficient\ndialogue to ensure that we were addressing similar problems concurrently. The inherent\nparadox in the notion that the improvisatory quality of our work was a consequence of\nworking slowly can perhaps best be explained in relation to the two most common models of\ncollaboration, mentioned at the start, where the composer presents a near-complete piece\n(or a series of sketches) for the performer to work on, or where the performer opens his \u2018box\nof tricks\u2019 for the composer\u2019s delectation; in each case one party restricts the other\u2019s options by\nbeing many steps ahead in the process. The way in which we worked was more open-ended,\nand thus kept much more in play. Our hope is that the sense of \u2018invention\u2019 that suffused our\nsessions is carried through into the music, which must in any case speak for itself. Although\nwe might point to the specific technical discoveries of our collaboration \u2013 specifically, the\n\u2018Doppelg\u00e4nger effect\u2019 and the \u2018killer double-stop\u2019 \u2013 as the least disputable \u2018research outcomes\u2019\nof the process, they represent only a small amount of what we did. It is actually the process of\ndiscovery or \u2018invention\u2019 within the piece that best represents the way in which its coming into\nbeing, and thus its \u2018research aspect\u2019, is inscribed within it.\nThe research aspect of the collaboration involves two levels of methodology: most obvi-\nously, the process by which we worked in relation to the instrument and the concepts\nembodied within it (\u2018invention\u2019), but also the re-evaluation of the composer\u2013performer\nrelationship. This research angle is of particular relevance in the present academic climate, in\nwhich the place of composers and performers within academe is coming under increased\nscrutiny from several quarters, not least funding bodies. The idea that one might choose to\nspend months, even years, on a ten-minute cello piece may indeed seem self-indulgently\nextravagant, since the \u2018research outcome\u2019 would be identical if the work had been written in\na week. A similar attitude is not unknown even among certain composers and performers, for\nwhom a species of \u2018corporate professionalism\u2019 has become the order of their working lives.\nFor these, the common models of composer\u2013performer collaboration (in so far as they are\nFitch and Heyde \u2018Recercar\u2019 \u2013 The Collaborative Process as Invention 93\ndeemed necessary at all) are not just a matter of pragmatism or expediency, but are enshrined\nas the embodiments of positive virtues. Again, none of what precedes is intended as a defence\nor a validation of a specific piece (let alone a \u2018research outcome\u2019). But by locating our\ndiscussion within the domain of methodology, we have tried to stake the claims of \u2018practical\nmusic making\u2019 to constitute research in the fullest sense of the term.17 It is our hope that this\naccount may assist those for whom a critical stance in relation to the creative process\n(whether their own or others\u2019) remains a central concern of creativity itself.\nDiscography\nFitch, Fabrice.
