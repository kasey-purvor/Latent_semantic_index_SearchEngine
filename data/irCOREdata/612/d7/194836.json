Since the closest approach in 1993,\nthe separation between the two stars has become increasingly favourable and we have recently\nbeen able to obtain a spectrum of the complete Balmer line series for Sirius B using the HST\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The quality of the STIS spectra greatly exceeds\nthat of previous ground-based spectra, and can be used to provide an important determination\nof the stellar temperature (Teff = 25 193 K) and gravity (log g = 8.556). In addition, we have\nobtained a new, more accurate, gravitational redshift of 80.42 \u00b1 4.83 km s\u22121 for Sirius B.\nCombining these results with the photometric data and the Hipparcos parallax, we obtain new\ndeterminations of the stellar mass for comparison with the theoretical mass\u2013radius relation.\nHowever, there are some disparities between the results obtained independently from log g\nand the gravitational redshift which may arise from flux losses in the narrow 50 \u00d7 0.2 arcsec2\nslit. Combining our measurements of Teff and log g with the Wood evolutionary mass\u2013radius\nrelation, we obtain a best estimate for the white dwarf mass of 0.978 M\u0001. Within the overall\nuncertainties, this is in agreement with a mass of 1.02 M\u0001 obtained by matching our new\ngravitational redshift to the theoretical mass\u2013radius relation.\nKey words: stars: abundances \u2013 stars: individual: Sirius B \u2013 white dwarfs \u2013 ultraviolet: stars.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nAs the nearest and visually brightest example, Sirius B is one of\nthe most important of all the white dwarf stars. Detected by Bessel\n(1844) through membership of a binary system, with its compan-\nion Sirius A, it provides an opportunity for an astrometric mass\ndetermination. This can be compared with other independent meth-\nods of determining stellar mass from spectroscopic temperature and\ngravity measurements and an observation of the gravitation red-\nshift. Unfortunately, the proximity of Sirius B to the primary star\nmakes most accurate spectroscopic and photometric observations\nextremely difficult. For example, at visible wavelengths Sirius A is\napproximately 10 mag brighter than Sirius B. Only at the shortest\n\u0001Based on observations with the NASA\/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, ob-\ntained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA,\nInc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.\n\u2020E-mail: mab@star.le.ac.uk\nfar-ultraviolet wavelengths or in the extreme ultraviolet\/soft X-ray\nband does Sirius B become brighter than Sirius A. Of course, ob-\nservations in these wavelength ranges only became possible in the\nspace-age.\nTherefore, for most of the time since its discovery astronomers\nhave needed to make the most challenging of observations to learn\nabout Sirius B. During this time, few useful spectra of the star were\nobtained. The first, by Adams (1915), revealed the enigma of white\ndwarf stars, showing Sirius B and Sirius A to be \u2018identical in all\nrespects so far as can be judged from a close comparison of the spec-\ntra\u2019, the much lower luminosity of Sirius B placing it in the lower-left\ncorner of the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell (HR) diagram along with 40 Eri\nB. From subsequent observations, Adams (1925) reported a first\ngravitational redshift. However, along with that reported by Moore\n(1928), the value was a factor of 4 too low due to contamination\nof the spectra by Sirius A (see discussions by Greenstein, Oke &\nShipman 1971, 1985; Wesemael 1985). For example, the results de-\npended on measurements of metallic lines such as Mg II 4481 \u00c5,\nwhich are now known not to occur in most white dwarfs. Indeed,\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nHST spectroscopy in Sirius B 1135\na reliable redshift (89 \u00b1 16 km s\u22121) was only eventually published\nby Greenstein et al. (1971) based on a photographic plate obtained\nin \u223c1963.\nGreenstein et al. (1971) also published measurements of the effec-\ntive temperature and surface gravity of Sirius B, based on their anal-\nysis of the H\u03b1 and H\u03b3 profiles, of 32 000 \u00b1 1000 K and log g = 8.65,\nrespectively. However, measurements based on only a few such line\nprofiles can be prone to ambiguities in the determination of these\nparameters. Also, modern computational fitting techniques allow\na complete objective exploration of the available parameter space\ncompared to the visual comparisons available to Greenstein et al.\n(1971). While the effective temperatures of DA white dwarfs can be\nformally measured to an accuracy of \u223c1 per cent between 20 000 and\n30 000 K, with access to the complete Balmer line series from H\u03b2 to\nH8 (see Finley, Koester & Basri 1997; Liebert, Bergeron & Holberg\n2005), estimates of Teff for Sirius B have ranged from the Greenstein\net al. value down to as low as 22 500 K (Koester 1979). The avail-\nability of low dispersion International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)\nand EXOSAT spectra refined the value of Teff to 26 000 \u00b1 2000 K\n(Holberg, Wesemael & Hubeny 1984; Paerels et al. 1988; Kidder,\nHolberg & Wesemael 1989). Most recently, Holberg et al. (1998)\nhave combined the IUE NEWSIPS data and the Extreme Ultraviolet\nExplorer (EUVE) spectrum to produce a new, well-defined effective\ntemperature of 24 790 \u00b1 100 K and surface gravity of log g = 8.57 \u00b1\n0.06. Coupled with the Hipparcos parallax of \u03c0 = 0.37921 \u00b1\n0.00158 arcsec and the Greenstein et al. gravitational redshift,\nHolberg et al. obtained a white dwarf mass of 0.984 \u00b1 0.074 M\u0001\nand a radius R = 0.0084 \u00b1 0.00025 R\u0001. This spectroscopic result\nis consistent with the astrometric mass of Gatewood & Gatewood\n(1978) and the joint spectrometric and astrometric constraints\nare within 1\u03c3 of the most recent thermally evolved mass\u2013radius\n(M\u2013R) relations of Wood (1992, 1995). Some of these earlier\nmeasurements are summarized in Table 2. Nevertheless, the spec-\ntroscopic uncertainties remain large at 7.5 per cent in mass and\n4 per cent in radius. A precise test of the mass\u2013radius relation for a\n\u223c1-M\u0001 white dwarf that can distinguish between different evolu-\ntionary models, for example, between thick and thin H layer, masses,\nrequires significantly reduced errors on the measured spectro-\nscopic parameters. While important improvements were achieved by\nHolberg et al. (1998), it is clear that the Balmer line technique pro-\nvides results of potentially greater accuracy if such a spectrum could\nbe obtained free from contamination by Sirius A.\nThe paper of Greenstein et al. (1971) does not reproduce the origi-\nnal photographic plate images, plotting just the scanned H\u03b1 and H\u03b3\nprofiles. Hence, it is difficult to judge the level of contamination\nfrom Sirius A in their work. Nor in any of the earlier works are the\noriginal photographic plates reproduced in the literature. Therefore,\na photographic spectrum obtained and published by Kodaira (1967)\nis of particular importance. This plate covers the Balmer line series\nfrom H\u03b3 through to H10 and the spectrum of Sirius B is clearly visi-\nble in the middle of scattered light contributions from the diffraction\nspikes of Sirius A. It also illustrates the particular difficulty of ob-\nserving the Sirius B from the ground because, even with \u223c1-arcsec\n\u2018seeing\u2019, the spectrum sits on a scattered light component \u223c1\/4 to\n1\/3 of its total flux.\nClearly, a visible band observation of Sirius B would be much\nbetter carried out in space, reducing considerably the problems dis-\ncussed above. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was the first in-\nstrument capable of obtaining such a spectrum, but for some time\nfollowing its launch Sirius B has been in an unfavourable position\nrelative to Sirius A, making its closest approach (as projected on the\nTable 1.

However, as the distance between the\ntwo binary companions has increased and we have obtained high-\nquality direct images of the system with the HST , it has become\nfeasible to obtain a Balmer line spectrum of Sirius B. We report\nhere on the analysis of the spectrum acquired with the Space Tele-\nscope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) during 2004, obtaining mea-\nsurements of Teff and log g, a new gravitational redshift and a\nrevised estimate of the visual magnitude, from which we determine\nthe white dwarf mass and radius.\n2 S T I S O B S E RVAT I O N O F S I R I U S B\nSirius B was observed with STIS on 2004 February 6, using the\nG430L and G750M gratings, to obtain coverage of the full Balmer\nline series (see Table 1). Even though the HST has the advantage\nof operating above the atmosphere, acquisition of a spectrum un-\ncontaminated by Sirius A remains a challenge, particularly as the\nlength of the spectrograph slit (52 arcsec) is considerably greater\nthan the dimensions of the Sirius system. As the orbit of Sirius is\nwell determined, it is quite straightforward to avoid placing Sirius\nA on the slit at the same time as Sirius B. However, it is inevitable\nin avoiding the primary that its diffraction spikes must then cross\nthe slit and may potentially contaminate the Sirius B spectrum. To\nreduce the level of contamination in the Sirius B spectrum to the\nlowest possible level, we chose a spacecraft orientation such that the\ntarget was equidistant between the locations of the Sirius A diffrac-\ntion spikes. Although we devised this approach independently, it\nis interesting to note that this same technique was adopted by\nKodaira (1967), although with less freedom available in the slit\norientation. This is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows our most re-\ncent HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) image of the\nSirius system, obtained as part of an ongoing programme of imag-\ning with which we are continually improving the astrometric orbit\nFigure 1.

Note\nthat in the spectroscopic exposure, the main Sirius A image is ob-\nscured and the vertical overexposed columns would not be present.\nWith relative freedom to choose the roll angle of the HST during\nthe spectroscopic exposures, we selected an orientation that placed\nSirius B almost exactly halfway between two of the diffraction\nspikes from Sirius A, in the direction perpendicular to the bleeding\ncolumns.\nThe G430L and G750M spectra were each obtained as a series\nof three separate exposures to maximize the signal-to-noise, while\npreventing saturation of the CCD, and for cosmic ray rejection. The\nCCD image of the G430L observation is shown in Fig. 2.

For comparison, we also show a slice through\nthe spectrum of Kodaira (1967) normalized to the same intensity and spatial\nscale. The dotted line is an extrapolation of the diffraction spike flux to show\nthe level of contamination in the spectrum of Sirius B.\nBalmer lines can be clearly seen in all the spectra. H\u03b2 is to the\nright of the image and the converging series limit to the left. Below\nthis is the same image using a logarithmic intensity scale, which\nenhances the lower flux levels showing the background and scattered\nlight components. The presence of the Balmer absorption line in the\nbackground shows it to be dominated by the scattered light from\nSirius A.\nTo demonstrate the relatively low level of the scattered light,\nwe display a cut through the image in Fig. 3. Also shown is an\nequivalent slice through the spectrum of Kodaira (1967), copied\nfrom the original paper and normalized to the same intensity and\nspatial scale as the HST data. This illustrates very clearly how the\nground-based observation has been compromised by the difficulties\nwith \u2018seeing\u2019. In the HST image, the diffraction spikes have a much\nlower intensity than Sirius B and the diffraction limited imaging\nprovides a clear separation of the spectra. Although the scattered\nlight component can be seen in the heavily contrast enhanced lower\nimage of Fig. 2, it is barely detectable in the intensity histogram. We\nestimate that the scattered light component is very much less than\n1 per cent of the flux of Sirius B in the G430L observation and is\n\u223c2 per cent in the G750M grating exposure.\n3 A NA LY S I S O F T H E BA L M E R L I N E\nS P E C T RU M O F S I R I U S B\n3.1 Spectroscopy\nThe G430L and G750M spectra of Sirius B were each obtained as a\nseries of three exposures to achieve the best possible signal-to-noise\nwhile avoiding saturation of the CCD and to facilitate removal of\ncosmic rays. These were automatically combined in the standard\nSTIS CCD pipeline before the Sirius B spectrum was extracted,\nbackground-subtracted and calibrated (see Kim Quijano et al. 2003).\nBoth resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the H\u03b1\nline profile (right) shows a slight \u2018roll-off\u2019 in the flux towards short\nwavelengths. Any light loss from the slit should be wavelength-\nindependent, suggesting that this is a calibration artefact. A similar\nfeature is seen in the G750M spectrum of G191\u2212B2B (Proffitt, pri-\nvate communication). Therefore, we did not include the H\u03b1 profile\nin the determination of temperature and gravity.\nOur standard technique (along with many other authors; see, for\nexample, Bergeron, Saffer & Liebert 1992; Barstow et al. 2003a)\nhas been to simultaneously compare the H\u03b2\u2013H\u03b5 lines with synthetic\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 362, 1134\u20131142\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nHST spectroscopy in Sirius B 1137\nFigure 4. Flux calibrated and background subtracted spectra of Sirius B obtained, as described in the text, with the G430L (3000\u20135700 \u00c5) and G750M\n(6300\u20136900 \u00c5) gratings of the STIS instrument on the HST .\nstellar spectra and use a \u03c72 fitting technique to determine the best\nvalue of Teff and log g. These models have been thoroughly de-\nscribed elsewhere (e.g. Barstow et al. 2003a,b). To take account\nof the possible systematic errors inherent in the flux calibration of\nground-based spectra, we have usually applied an independent nor-\nmalization constant to each line. However, in the case of the HST ,\nthere is no atmospheric attenuation to deal with, removing one of the\nprimary uncertainties in the flux calibration process. Furthermore,\npartly as a result of this, the calibration of the STIS instrument is ex-\ntremely accurate and stable. The absolute flux scale is based on four\nprimary DA white dwarf standards (G191\u2212B2B, GD153, GD71\nand HZ43), which are pure hydrogen models normalized to Landolt\nV-band photometry, which yields absolute fluxes determined to\n\u223c4 per cent in the far-ultraviolet and to \u223c2 per cent at longer wave-\nlengths (Bohlin 2000; Bohlin, Dickinson & Calzetti 2001). Pho-\ntometric repeatability is in the 0.2\u20130.4 per cent range. With such\naccuracy and repeatability, we have fit the complete spectrum of\nSirius B covering the Balmer lines from H\u03b2 down to the series\nlimit, a wavelength range from \u223c5200 to 3800 \u00c5. We used a \u03c72\nstatistic to determine the values of Teff and log g that yield the best\nagreement between the model and data. The result of this analysis\nis shown in Fig. 5, with the best-fitting values and their associated\nuncertainties listed in Table 2. We note that a standard analysis of\nthe individual lines (discussed above) yields similar results but with\nlarger uncertainties.\nThe \u223c0.15 per cent errors on Teff and log g quoted in Table 2 are\nremarkably small and represent the formal internal errors arising\nfrom the spectral analysis. However, they only take into account\nthe statistical errors on the data points and do not deal with any\nsystematic errors arising from the analysis procedure, data reduc-\ntion and or calibration. It is important to question how realistic\nthese are in the light of the magnitudes estimated by other authors.\nFor example, Bergeron et al. (1992) quote typical errors 350 K\n(\u223c1.5\u20132 per cent) in Teff and 0.05 dex in log g for their sample of\nDA white dwarfs, while Finley et al. (1997) find internal errors of\n1 per cent and 0.02 dex, respectively. Probably the best and most\nconsistent set of Balmer line analyses is that carried out for the\nPalomar Green (PG) sample by Liebert et al. (2005). Their internal\nuncertainties are 1.2 per cent in Teff and 0.038 dex in log g. These are\nground-based results. We are operating in uncharted territory as our\nspace-based STIS spectrum is virtually unique in its high signal-to-\nnoise and spectrophotometric fidelity. On the other hand, we do not\nhave other observations to help assess the reliability of the quoted\nerrors. Taking a conservative approach we would adopt errors typ-\nical of those obtained from the ground-based studies. However, in\nthe context of the systematic uncertainties reported in the latter sec-\ntions of this paper these spectral analysis errors are small and do not\ncontribute significantly to overall error budget.\n3.2 Photometry\nOne of the primary sources of uncertainty in the analysis of most\nprevious Sirius B data has been the lack of accurate photometry.\nTraditionally, this has meant measuring or estimating the V magni-\ntude of the white dwarf. In most past work (e.g. Holberg et al. 1998),\nwe have used the estimate of V = 8.44 \u00b1 0.06 from Holberg et al.\n(1984), which in turn was based on an average of various published\nmeasurements. With the high spectrophotometric accuracy of the\nHST calibration, we have a first opportunity to determine magni-\ntudes for Sirius B in various bands that have an equivalent accuracy\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 362, 1134\u20131142\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1138 M.

The\nusefulness of such a model is twofold. First, it covers wavelengths\noutside the range of the G430L spectrum. Secondly, it provides a\nnoiseless numerical representation of the absolute spectrum, which\ncan be accurately convolved with various filter functions to give\nsynthetic magnitudes in different bands. The method that we use\nbegins with the new absolute spectrophotometry of Vega (\u03b1 Lyrae)\npresented in Bohlin & Gilliand (2004). These authors directly mea-\nsured the absolute flux of Vega using the STIS CCD and various\ngratings covering the wavelength range 1700 \u00c5 to 1 \u00b5m. A new V\nmagnitude (0.026 \u00b1 0.008) and new absolute flux at 5556 \u00c5 (3.46 \u00d7\n10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121) were also determined. Bohlin & Gilliland es-\ntimate the uncertainty in the Vega fluxes to be better than 1 per cent.\nMore importantly, Vega is now directly on the same HST white\ndwarf flux scale used to define the STIS calibration, and hence our\nSirius B fluxes. We can therefore convolve any well-defined set of\nrelative filter functions with the Vega flux distribution to derive ap-\npropriate flux zero-points for each filter. Convolution of the same\nfilter functions with the Sirius B spectrum, together with the ap-\nplication of the flux zero-points, gives the synthetic magnitudes of\nSirius B for each filter. Further, it is a simple matter to confirm these\nprocedures by applying the same filter functions and zero-points\nto the set of four fundamental white dwarfs (GD 71, GD 153, HZ\n43 and G191B2B), which define the HST calibration system and to\nverify that the resulting synthetic magnitudes match the observed\nground-based magnitudes.\nIn seeking to minimize the effect of scattered light from Sirius A,\nwe chose to use the small 0.2-arcsec slit for both spectroscopic ob-\nservations. This is also important for obtaining the best possible\nspectral resolution for the gravitational redshift measurement (see\nSection 3.3). Therefore, although the nominal absolute calibration\nof the HST spectrographs is \u223c1 per cent, we must also consider\nthe light losses associated with this narrow slit. There are two dis-\ntinct effects. First, recent adjustments to the flux calibration are\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 362, 1134\u20131142\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nHST spectroscopy in Sirius B 1139\nnot included in the standard pipeline. These are not, as yet, docu-\nmented formally but have been supplied to us by C. R. Proffitt (pri-\nvate communication). For the G430L grating and 52 \u00d7 0.2 arcsec2\naperture, the flux measurement from the pipeline is overestimated\nby a smooth wavelength-dependent factor ranging from \u223c5 to\n7 per cent. Accordingly, we have corrected the measured fluxes\nused in the analyses reported here using the appropriate function.\nThere are insufficient calibration data available for a similar anal-\nysis to be carried out for the G750M 52 \u00d7 0.2 arcsec2 aperture\ncombination.\nWhile light losses, arising from the use of the small aperture, are\nin principle taken into account in the calibration pipeline, there is\nan enhanced scatter in the accuracy of the flux determination due to\nstochastic effects on the placement of the source in the slit. Bohlin\n(1998) estimates this to have an rms value of 4.5 per cent for the\n52 \u00d7 0.2 arcsec2 slit, dominating the 1 per cent absolute calibra-\ntion error, which yields a 0.05-mag uncertainty in the photometry.\nTherefore, the uncertainty that we can assign to the synthetic mag-\nnitudes and fluxes measured here will be correspondingly greater\nthan the formal absolute error. However, we note that the increased\nuncertainty associated with light loss in the slit can only be single-\nsided, as flux can only be lost and not gained relative to the true\nbrightness. Therefore, any determination of the flux, and the cor-\nresponding magnitudes, has an asymmetric range of uncertainty of\n+5 and \u22121 per cent.\nWe have chosen the UBVRI filter responses defined by Cohen et al.\n(2003) for this work. These include detailed atmospheric transition\nmodifications to the Landolt (1992) UBVRI filter functions. Bohlin\n& Gilliland use the Cohen et al. V-band filter function to establish\ntheir V magnitude for Vega. In addition to the Cohen et al. UBVRI\nfilter functions, we also use the observed V magnitudes of Vega\nfrom Bessell, Castelli & Plez (1998), except for V where we use\nthe Bohlin & Gilliland Vega V magnitude. The relation between\nintegrated fluxes, Fint, the Vega magnitudes and filter constants is\ngiven in equations (1) and (2):\nFint =\n\u222b f (\u03bb)S(\u03bb) d\u03bb\n\u222b\nS(\u03bb) d\u03bb (1)\nFilter const. = Vega mag. + 2.5 log(Fint). (2)\nHere, f (\u03bb) is the Vega flux and S(\u03bb) is the relative filter response\nfunction. In Table 3 we provide the results of these calculations for\nSirius B, the UBVRI filters, including the logs of the flux zero-points,\nthe observed Vega magnitudes and synthetic Sirius magnitudes for\neach filter.\nUsing these same procedures for GD 71, GD 153, HZ 43 and G191\nB2B, the absolute values of the differences between the synthetic and\nthe observed (Landolt) magnitudes are less than 0.007 mag for each\nfilter, except for the U band. The numerical definition of the U filter\nfunction extends shortward of the atmospheric cut-off and thus will\nnot correspond to any observed U magnitude. Our synthetic Sirius B\nU magnitude therefore represents a hypothetical observation above\nTable 3. Synthetic photometry of Sirius B.\nBand Vega Mag. Filter Const.

Because our calculations are self-consistent with respect\nto the HST flux scale, we have set the uncertainties for each mag-\nnitude to 0.05 mag to accommodate the estimated uncertainty in\nthat scale and to take account of the small, 0.2 arcsec, aperture used\nin the observations. This is not much smaller than the uncertainty\nobtained by Rakos & Havlen (1977). Using V = 8.528 \u00b1 0.05 and\nour adopted trigonometric parallax for Sirius B, we find an absolute\nmagnitude of M v = 11.427 \u00b1 0.05.\n3.3 Gravitational redshift\nThe primary aim of obtaining the higher-resolution G750M spec-\ntrum was to use the narrow H\u03b1 core to obtain a gravitational redshift\nfor Sirius B. To do this, we cross-correlated a synthetic H\u03b1 pro-\nfile, computed for the temperature and gravity determined for the\nother Balmer lines, with the observed line and calculated the relative\nDoppler shift between the two using a \u03c72 minimization technique.\nWith the narrow H\u03b1 core, this technique yields a formal fractional\nuncertainty in z of \u223c1 per cent.\nWith such precision, it is important to consider any systematic\neffects that might contribute to the overall uncertainty. For example,\nwith a predicted redshift of \u223c70 km s\u22121 (before correction for \u03b3\nand K velocities), the observed wavelength shift will be \u223c1.5 \u00c5.\nTherefore, it is necessary to use a reference wavelength for H\u03b1 that\nis accurate to better than 0.01 \u00c5. Accordingly, we have recalculated\nthe wavelength of H\u03b1 from the weighted mean of the fine structure\nenergy levels, obtaining a value of 6564.6271 \u00c5 in vacuum, which\nwe adopt for this analysis. We note that, although we are dealing\nwith visible light wavelengths for which the wavelength calibration\nis usually carried out in air (for ground-based telescopes), the STIS\ncalibration refers to vacuum at all wavelengths.\nAlthough we take account of Stark broadening in calculating the\nprofiles of the Balmer (and Lyman) lines in the synthetic spectra,\nusing the tables of Lemke (1997), we have not routinely consid-\nered the possible Stark shifts of the lines. These are predicted to\nbe quite small but are always in the redward direction and could\ncontribute to an increased redshift measurement compared to the\ntrue gravitational value. Greenstein et al. (1971) estimated such a\nshift to be about 8 km s\u22121, based on the data of Wiese & Kelleher\n(1971). In the context of the \u00b116 km s\u22121 uncertainty in their red-\nshift measurement, this is not significant and the magnitude of\nthe Stark shift was not considered further, due to the noise in the\nWiese & Kelleher (1971) data for small shifts and the complexity\nof the radiative transfer problem. However, compared to our red-\nshift measurements, which have a formal 1 per cent accuracy, this\n\u223c10 per cent contribution to the measured redshift (equivalent to\n\u223c0.15 \u00c5 in the measured wavelength shift) would be extremely im-\nportant. However, the reported possible shifts are highly dependent\non the plasma density, which is determined by the Balmer line forma-\ntion depth. A full radiative transfer treatment is needed to determine\nwhether or not the Stark pressure shift makes a significant contribu-\ntion to the measured redshift. Consequently, we have modified the\nspectral synthesis program SYNSPEC to include the effect of Stark\nshifts in the calculation of the Balmer and Lyman line profiles. We\nfollowed the procedure outlined by Grabowski et al. (1987). For a\nwhite dwarf of the temperature and gravity of Sirius B, the additional\nStark shift predicted by the new spectral synthesis calculations is\ntiny and does not need to be considered in this (or any) analysis.\nThe H\u03b1 line extends across \u223c300 pixels of the G750M spectrum.\nIt is possible to use just the narrow line core or the core and wings for\nthe redshift measurement. It is debatable whether using the narrow\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 362, 1134\u20131142\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1140 M. A.

Table 4 records the observed\nwavelength shift and corresponding velocity for several different\npixel ranges. There is a significant scatter in the values obtained,\ncompared to the formal statistical errors, indicating the possible\nlevel of any systematic errors. In our further analysis, we adopt the\nmean of these redshift values and their standard deviation as an in-\ndication of the true uncertainty in the measurement. In addition, we\nmust also consider the uncertainty in the calibration of the wave-\nlength scale, which is \u223c0.2 pixel (0.12 \u00c5) for the narrow slit, giving\na total uncertainty of 6 per cent of the measured redshift.\nTo convert this into a gravitational redshift it is necessary to take\naccount of the radial velocity of Sirius B, which consists of the\ngamma velocity of the system and the K velocity of Sirius B. The\napparent velocity is the algebraic sum of the gravitational redshift,\nthe orbital velocity of Sirius B and the \u03b3 velocity of the system\nbarycentre. We have independently determined the latter two quan-\ntities in order to estimate the intrinsic gravitational redshift of the\nwhite dwarf (Holberg, in preparation). The system velocity or \u03b3 ve-\nlocity can be directly determined from the apparent radial velocity\nof Sirius A as a function of time. Holberg (in preparation) has fit\nthe published velocities of Sirius A allowing the constant \u03b3 veloc-\nity to vary as a free parameter. The observed velocities were taken\nfrom the literature and included early, turn of the last century, pho-\ntographic measurements as well as more recent CCD observations\nfrom nine observatories. In most instances the data points repre-\nsented annual or semi-annual averages from a given observatory.\nWhere uncertainties were not provided, they were estimated from\nthe standard deviations of the means or were assigned a value as\ntypical for a given observatory at that period. No attempt was made\nto adjust velocity zero-points between different observatories. Sev-\neral obviously discrepant observations were excluded. The direct\n\u03c72 fit for the \u03b3 velocity yields \u22127.85 \u00b1 0.72 km s\u22121. The result is\nonly very weakly dependent on any reasonable selection of orbital\nparameters and stellar mass ratio and is in good agreement with\nearlier results obtained by Campbell (1905), Aitken (1918) and van\nden Bos (1960): \u22127.4, \u22127.37 and \u22127.43 km s\u22121, respectively. None\nof these earlier results, however, appears to have corrected for the\ngravitational redshift of Sirius A (+0.75 km s\u22121). When this cor-\nrection is applied, the resulting value of \u03b3 = \u22128.60 \u00b1 0.72 km s\u22121.\nThe orbital Doppler velocity of Sirius B on 2004 February 6\n(\u22121.49 km s\u22121) can be obtained directly from the work of Holberg\n(in preparation). Thus, the additive correction to be applied to our\napparent Doppler velocity of Sirius B is \u221210.09 \u00b1 0.72 km s\u22121,\nyielding a value of 80.42 \u00b1 4.83 for the gravitational redshift of the\nwhite dwarf.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nWe have presented an initial analysis of the first Balmer line spec-\ntrum of Sirius B obtained from space.

It is clear, from Tables 2 and 5, that the uncertainties in the\ndetermination of all these parameters are considerably improved\nfrom their earlier values. Within the quoted errors, the values ob-\ntained in this work are mostly compatible with the previous deter-\nminations, apart from Teff. However, it is important to note that the\nolder measurements of Teff and log g were made using a previous\ngeneration of stellar atmosphere calculations, which might explain\nthe difference between the temperature values. A thorough analysis\nof other data sets with the most recent models will be required to\nresolve this.\nWith improved measurements of the physical parameters of\nSirius B, it should now be possible to improve the accuracy of the\ndetermination of the mass and radius and, as a result, provide a more\ndefinitive test of the white dwarf mass\u2013radius relation.\n4.1 Radius and mass of Sirius B\nRather than calculating the photometric radius of Sirius B from the\nsynthetic V magnitude, it is more straightforward to simply use the\nnormalization applied to the best-fitting spectral model to match\nthe observational data. This conveniently defines the stellar solid\nangle (R2\/D2). Using our adopted trigonometric parallax, we\ncan then calculate the white dwarf radius directly. We have per-\nformed this exercise for both our G430L and G750M data, as\nsummarized in Table 5. The observational uncertainties in R are\ndominated by the systematic errors in the HST flux scale. It can\nbe seen that the values of R2\/D2 and R are not identical for each\ngrating, although they do agree within the identified systematic un-\ncertainties. We note that the G430L flux scale has had a flux scale\ncorrection applied that is not included in the pipeline processing (as\ndiscussed in Section 3.2). No similar correction could be applied to\nthe G750M data because the relevant calibration information is not\navailable.\nHaving determined the radius of Sirius B, there are two indepen-\ndent ways that we can estimate its mass from the available data, using\nrelations including the surface gravity or the gravitational redshift:\ng = G M\/R2 Vgr = 0.636M\/R. (3)\nBecause there are two estimates for the stellar radius, we have made\nseparate calculations of the mass using each of these (Table 5).\nIt is clear that the two different methods of estimating the\nwhite dwarf mass are giving us different answers. However, within\nthe overall uncertainties that we have uncovered in the flux and\nwavelength calibration, the results are formally more or less com-\npatible but at the very extremes of the range within which they\nremain consistent. Indeed, the 1\u03c3 ranges of M determined for the\nradius derived from the G430L flux level do not quite overlap.

The lower pair of error bars [light grey (green) and mid-grey (purple)] are the corresponding mass determinations for the lower radius\nobtained from the G430L results.\nis illustrated in Fig. 6. A method for combining all the previously\navailable data has been described by Holberg et al. (1998), and we\ncompare that analysis with the new values of M and R listed in\nTable 5 and shown in Fig. 6. This shows 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 error regions\ndetermined by Holberg et al. (1998) together with the allowed as-\ntrometric mass range from Gatewood & Gatewood (1978). As we\nhave no information on which of the G430L or G750M flux levels\nyields the \u2018best\u2019 determination of the white dwarf radius, we plot\nboth sets of results. The upper error bars are those corresponding\nto the G750M measurement with the mass derived from the surface\ngravity on the left and that from the gravitational redshift on the right\n[dark grey (blue on-line) and mid-grey (red) crosses, respectively].\nThe lower pair of error bars (green and purple) are the corresponding\nmass determinations for the lower radius obtained from the G430L\nresults.\nAlthough the different determinations of M are not significantly\ndifferent outside the assigned 1\u03c3 uncertainties ranges, it is a concern\nthat we do not obtain better agreement between the various methods\nof determining M. In theory, it should be possible to treat the data\nwe have obtained with the HST in the manner described by Holberg\net al. (1998) to determine a \u2018best-fitting\u2019 mass. However, if we do this\nwith our results, the \u03c7 2 minimization technique is rather unstable\nand very sensitive to the adopted 1\u03c3 errors, the values of which are\nthemselves uncertain in the light of the systematic effects we have\ndiscussed in this paper. Therefore, we do not believe that the Holberg\net al. (1998) method will give a reliable result with the current data.\nComparing the values of M and R obtained in this work with the\nearlier results is interesting. Individually, only the G430L\/surface\ngravity measurement of M is incompatible with Holberg et al.\n(1998). However, if the astrometric mass determination is taken\ninto account, only the values of M derived from the gravitational\nredshift are consistent. Of the measurements we have made, the\nmost problematic is the determination of the stellar radius. Using\nthe narrow slit, it is possible that there could be a loss of light and,\nas a result, an erroneously low flux determination. This would lead\nto a low estimate for the white dwarf radius. We have tried to take\naccount of this possibility in the assignment of experimental errors.\nHowever, if there really were a light loss at the \u223c5 per cent level\n(the extreme possibility) the overall agreement between the mass\ndeterminations would be improved. An independent measurement\nof the white dwarf flux would be helpful in resolving this question.\nAlthough the main theme of this analysis has been to obtain mea-\nsurements of M and R that are independent of the white dwarf evo-\nlutionary models, given the difficulty in obtaining a reliable stel-\nlar radius (on which our measurements depend), it is worthwhile\ncarrying out an empirical determination of M using them. Taking\nthe values of Teff and log g determined in this paper, we interpo-\nlate between the evolutionary models of Wood (1995), which are\ncomputed for discrete white dwarf masses in steps of 0.2 M\u0001, ob-\ntaining M = 0.978 \u00b1 0.005 M\u0001 and R = 0.00864 \u00b1 0.00012 R\u0001\nfor Sirius B. The corresponding gravitational redshift is 72.0 \u00b1\n1.0 km s\u22121. We note that, as in the discussion in Section 3.1 on the\nspectral analysis, the formal errors quoted here are probably factors\n\u223c5\u201310 too small if we adopt errors for Teff and log g typical of the\nground-based studies. With this in mind, these empirical values of M\nand R are consistent with those obtained directly from the STIS ob-\nservations, provided we adopt the flux level taken from the G750M\nobservation rather than the more thoroughly calibrated G430M.\nThe evolutionary calculations of mass and radius can also be\ncompared to our new measurement of the gravitational redshift, as\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 362, 1134\u20131142\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1142 M.

This is the first such spectrum to be acquired,\napart from old ground-based photographic spectra, and can be used\nto provide an important determination of the stellar temperature\n(Teff = 25193 \u00b1 37 K) and gravity (log g = 8.566 \u00b1 0.010).

Combining these results\nwith the photometric information available in our spectra and the\nHipparcos parallax, we have provided new determinations of the\nstellar mass and radius for comparison with the theoretical mass\u2013\nradius relation. However, there are some disparities between the\nvalues of stellar mass obtained by two different routes, and we have\nidentified significant systematic uncertainties that make the observa-\ntional errors larger than we had hoped. While we have attempted to\nmake measurements of the mass and radius of the white dwarf inde-\npendently of the evolutionary model calculations (e.g. Wood 1992,\n1995), we obtain much better agreement between our results and\nthose of other authors if we use our spectroscopic measurements\nof Teff and log g in conjunction with the theoretical mass\u2013radius\nrelation. Our best estimates of M and R from this approach are\n0.978 \u00b1 0.005 M\u0001 and 0.00864 \u00b1 0.00012 R\u0001, respectively.\nThe gravitational redshift gives us an estimate of M\/R directly,\nwhich can also be compared to the Wood (1995) models, yield-\ning M = 1.02 \u00b1 0.02 and R = 0.0081 \u00b1 0.0002. These values\nare all in good agreement with the measurements of other authors\nand internally consistent with our independent measurements, pro-\nvided we utilize the stellar absolute flux obtained from the G750M\ngrating.\nA particular problem we have encountered is that of possible light\nloss due to the use of the narrow 50 \u00d7 0.2 arcsec2 slit, yielding a\nmeasured flux for Sirius B lower than the true value. Indeed, the bet-\nter consistency of results derived from the G750M flux compared\nto the better calibrated G430L data is indicative of a problem. We\nanticipate that it will be possible to improve on the measurement\nderived from our STIS spectra in the future, by making use of the\nWFPC2 images we have acquired for the study of the binary orbit.\nIn addition, with a wealth of other data also available from soft\nX-ray, extreme ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet wavebands, an im-\nportant exercise will be to combine all the information we have\nto provide the best possible estimate of the mass and radius of\nSirius B.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThese observations were obtained through the Guest Observer pro-\ngramme of the HST .
