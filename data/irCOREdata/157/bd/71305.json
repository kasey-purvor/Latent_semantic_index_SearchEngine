Introduction\nDebate concerning how children come to understand the\nsocial and psychological world, now often known as chil-\ndren\u2019s \u201ctheories of mind,\u201d has become increasingly con-\ncerned with the influence of social interaction. Recent stud-\nies have found that individual differences in preschoolers\u2019\ncompetence on measures of false belief understanding are\ncorrelated with aspects of children\u2019s socialization history. By\nsuggesting that social interaction may influence the devel-\nopment of children\u2019s mentalistic understanding, this re-\nsearch has reopened issues that have long been discussed\nin the debate over how children come to understand the\nmind.\nAs an example of this research, Perner et al. (1994) re-\nported that preschoolers with siblings demonstrate false be-\nlief understanding at an earlier age than children without\nsiblings. This \u201csibling effect\u201d was replicated by Jenkins and\nAstington (1996), although they found it to be less pro-\nnounced for children with more advanced linguistic abili-\nties. Lewis et al. (1996) also found in one study an associa-\ntion between number of siblings and performance on false\nbelief tests, but, overall, they found a more consistent ef-\nfect of older siblings and kin on the development of false\nbelief understanding. In a series of experiments with a large\nnumber of participants, beneficial effects were found for\nolder but not younger siblings (Ruffman et al. 1998). The\nsibling effect was not replicated, however, in two more re-\ncent studies involving working-class families (Cole &\nMitchell 2000; Cutting & Dunn 1999). This research sug-\ngests the possibility that, rather than just the number of\npeople in the household, it is the nature of the relationships\nchildren experience that influences development (Hughes\net al. 1999). There is further evidence of correlations be-\ntween social cognitive development and parenting style\n(Hughes et al. 1999; Ruffman et al. 1999; Vinden 2001), as-\npects of parent-child conversation (Sabbagh & Callanan\n1998), attachment (Fonagy et al. 1997; Meins 1997; Meins\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27, 79\u2013151\nPrinted in the United States of America\n\u00a9 2004 Cambridge University Press 0140-525X\/04 $12.50 79\nConstructing an understanding\nof mind: The development of\nchildren\u2019s social understanding within\nsocial interaction\nJeremy I.

However, such theories must be able to account for the accumulating evi-\ndence of the role of social interaction in the development of social understanding. We propose an alternative account, according to which\nthe development of children\u2019s social understanding occurs within triadic interaction involving the child\u2019s experience of the world as well\nas communicative interaction with others about their experience and beliefs (Chapman 1991; 1999). It is through such triadic interaction\nthat children gradually construct knowledge of the world as well as knowledge of other people. We contend that the extent and nature of\nthe social interaction children experience will influence the development of children\u2019s social understanding. Increased opportunity to en-\ngage in cooperative social interaction and exposure to talk about mental states should facilitate the development of social understanding.\nWe review evidence suggesting that children\u2019s understanding of mind develops gradually in the context of social interaction. Therefore,\nwe need a theory of development in this area that accords a fundamental role to social interaction, yet does not assume that children sim-\nply adopt socially available knowledge but rather that children construct an understanding of mind within social interaction.\nKeywords: language; Piaget; social interaction; theories of mind; Vygotsky; Wittgenstein\net al. 1998; Symons & Clark 2000), mothers\u2019 education\n(Cutting & Dunn 1999), and socioeconomic circumstances\n(Holmes et al. 1996).\nFurthermore, a number of studies have found correla-\ntions between language and social understanding (e.g.,\nCutting & Dunn 1999; de Villers 2000; Happ\u00e9 1995; Jenk-\nins & Astington 1996). In longitudinal studies, forms of\nfamily talk about mental states have been found to be re-\nlated to later success on false belief tests (e.g., Brown et al.\n1996; Dunn et al. 1991a; Moore et al. 1994; Ruffman et al.\n2002). In addition, mothers who think of their children in\nmentalistic terms (\u201cmindmindedness\u201d), and therefore,\npresumably talk to their children about the psychological\nworld, have children who are more advanced in under-\nstanding beliefs than are other children (Meins & Ferny-\nhough 1999; Meins et al. 1998). Similar correlations be-\ntween family interaction and the development of children\u2019s\nunderstanding of emotions have also been reported (e.g.,\nDunn et al. 1991b; Hooven et al. 1995; Kuebli et al. 1995;\nSteele et al. 1999). In a longitudinal study, Astington and\nJenkins (1999) found that earlier language abilities predict\nlater false belief performance but earlier false belief com-\npetence does not predict later language abilities, support-\ning the conclusion that language is important in social cog-\nnitive development.\nAnother source of evidence that social interaction is im-\nportant for the development of a mentalistic understanding\ncomes from research with deaf children. A number of stud-\nies have shown that deaf children with hearing parents are\ndelayed in the development of false belief understanding,\nwhereas deaf children with deaf parents are not delayed\n(Peterson & Siegal 2000; Woolfe et al. 2002). This seems to\nbe because deaf parents are native users of sign language\nand thus their children are exposed to normal conversation,\nbut hearing parents are less fluent in sign language and\ntherefore their children are not exposed to complex con-\nversation about everyday events involving people\u2019s actions,\nbeliefs, and emotions. Conversation about the mental world\nmay well be essential for the development of social under-\nstanding.\nThis accumulating evidence that aspects of social inter-\naction are correlated with social understanding must be ex-\nplained by a complete account of social cognitive develop-\nment. The contemporary body of research in this area\nderives from one of the dominant theories according to\nwhich children come to understand their own and others\u2019\nminds by formulating an implicit \u201ctheory\u201d of the mind (Ast-\nington et al. 1988). In this article we will, in general, use the\nbroader phrase, social understanding (Dunn 1988) as we\npresent an alternative position. All theories of the develop-\nment of social understanding have had to recognize the in-\nfluence of social interaction on social understanding, but\nthey do so in very different ways and most accounts still be-\ngin from an individualistic perspective. It has seemed that\nthe only possible alternative is to contrast individualistic ac-\ncounts with unspecified statements about the \u201cencultura-\ntion\u201d of the child. In this article we argue for an alternative\naccount of the development of mental state understanding\nthat integrates the social and individual dimensions of de-\nvelopment. We contend that the child does not merely\nadopt socially available knowledge, but rather, within social\ninteractions an understanding of mental states develops\nand is constituted. Our approach is based on Chapman\u2019s\n(1991; 1999) reformulation of Piagetian theory, drawing on\nVygotsky and Wittgenstein, and it is also consistent in some\nways with other contemporary approaches (Hobson 1993;\n2002; Montgomery 1997).\nTo introduce our alternative theory, we set it in the con-\ntext of continuing debates and competing theories within\nthe \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tradition (sect. 2). We first discuss the\nmore general issue concerning the relative contributions of\nsocial versus individual processes in development (sect.\n2.1), and then turn to attempts by competing theories to ex-\nplain the role of social interaction in the development of\nchildren\u2019s social understanding (sect. 2.2). In the third sec-\ntion, we introduce our alternative constructivist approach\nin which we argue that social interaction is essential in the\ndevelopment of cognitive, social, and moral knowledge. We\nbriefly discuss the development of infants\u2019 ability to engage\nin triadic interaction involving the self, others, and the\nphysical world (sect. 3.1). This basic yet essential level of \nsocial understanding allows children to engage actively in\nsocial interaction and to acquire language, and thereby\ngradually to develop a more sophisticated mentalistic un-\nderstanding by learning the criteria for the use of words re-\nferring to the mental world (sect. 3.2). In the fourth section,\nwe address two important issues that distinguish our ac-\ncount from those we criticize. We explore what has been\ntaken as the crucial evidence for the dominant theoretical\napproach and suggest that the explanatory framework pre-\nsented here explains the data more completely (sect. 4.1).\nNot only does the constructivist perspective better account\nfor the range of experimental evidence, it can also explain\nthe role of relationships in social development, like the sib-\nling effect and the influence of attachment patterns (sect.\n4.2). We conclude (sect. 5) by making some suggestions for\nfuture directions in research that follow from our theoreti-\ncal perspective.\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n80 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nJeremy I.

The problem with the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tradition\nThe problem with the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d literature is that the\nmajority of approaches to the issue are individualistic. This\nis usually contrasted with a straw person, referred to as en-\nculturation. In the two parts of this section we first describe\na solution to the individual\/social dichotomy before articu-\nlating how the problem of individualism manifests itself in\ncontemporary theories.\n2.1. Theory construction versus social construction:\nIndividualism, collectivism, and relationalism\nAt the broadest level, debate regarding the development of\nchildren\u2019s social understanding concerns the relative con-\ntributions of social and individual processes. This is the is-\nsue of whether theories start with the individual or focus on\nthe influence of the social group on development. We first\nillustrate how this issue has emerged in research on the de-\nvelopment of children\u2019s social understanding, and then set\nthis debate in the context of the more general issue in or-\nder to derive an approach to resolve this problem.\nIn the context of social cognitive development, the de-\nvelopmental question, according to Raver and Leadbeater\n(1993), is \u201cwhether the true starting point is to be located\nin the single, isolated, free mind of the individual or in a so-\ncial, communal world of shared experience or language\u201d\n(p. 355). Raver and Leadbeater contrasted the \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d and social development research programs and sug-\ngested that\nTheory-of-mind research focuses on the single mind of the indi-\nvidual child as a rational empiricist, processing incoming percep-\ntual data and reporting the results of those observations. In con-\ntrast, social developmentalists focus on the interaction of at least\ndyads, and the development of social minds of children commu-\nnicating in a peopled world. (Raver & Leadbeater 1993, p. 355)\nThis tension has also been articulated by Astington and\nOlson (1995) as occurring between theory construction and\nsocial construction. They suggested that an alternative to\ntheory construction in which \u201cchildren construct a theory\nabout human talk and action\u201d (p. 185) is a process of en-\nculturation in which \u201cchildren internalize the folk psychol-\nogy of their particular culture\u201d (p. 184), and, therefore, an\nunderstanding of mind acquired in such a fashion is \u201ca set\nof cultural norms\u201d (p. 185). In this view, social construction\nis equivalent to enculturation and the ability to \u201cparticipate\nin a kind of interpretive discourse. . . . In the one case the\nchild is seen as constructing concepts, in the other as inter-\nnalizing social understanding\u201d (p. 185). Internalization, in\nthis socialization approach, involves making external social\nnorms internal. This enculturation approach, which has\nbeen attributed to Wittgenstein, was clearly stated by Ast-\nington and Gopnik (1991, pp. 19\u201320):\nOn this view folk psychology is . . . what Wittgenstein would call\na \u201cform of life,\u201d a set of social and cultural practices and con-\nventions. The mechanism for development, on this view, would\nbe socialization or enculturation \u2013 children would learn how to\npsychologize appropriately in the way that they learn to dress\nproperly or eat politely,\nor learn that \u201cforks go on the left\u201d (Gopnik 1993, p. 3). Ast-\nington and Gopnik (1991, p. 20) further specified the dif-\nference between the view they attributed to Wittgenstein\nand the \u201ctheory formation\u201d view, by stating that\ntheories always develop with reference to the outside world;\nput very simply, a theory former wants to get closer to the truth.\nCultural practices, on the other hand, are, at least largely, self-\nconstitutive: they make themselves the case. Theories are true\nor false, cultural practices are right or wrong.1\nThe implication of this interpretation of Wittgenstein is\nthat social cognition is relativistic and therefore forms of so-\ncial understanding are culture-specific and free to vary\nacross cultures, just as ways to dress properly or eat politely\nvary. We, however, argue in section 3.2 for a different in-\nterpretation of Wittgenstein. Briefly, although we acknowl-\nedge cultural variation (Lillard 1998; Vinden 1996; 1999),\nthe basic forms of understanding of self and others that we\nare concerned with in this target article are built onto forms\nof shared practice or everyday activities that are necessarily\npart of human interaction, such as adults caring for infants,\nand are therefore likely to be common across cultures (Can-\nfield 1993).\nAstington and Olson (1995), as well as Raver and Lead-\nbeater (1993), suggested the need for an integration of the\ntwo perspectives \u2013 that is, the isolated individual formulat-\ning a theory of social behavior versus the child passively\nadopting concepts available from the culture. The conflict\nbetween these two contrasting positions, often referred to\nas individualism and collectivism, is a general issue con-\ncerning the role of social interaction in the development of\nknowledge that arises in many areas of development\n(Carpendale & M\u00fcller 2004). Given that he is often misla-\nbeled as the archetypal \u201cindividualist\u201d developmental the-\noretician, it might seem surprising that it was this \u201cperen-\nnial problem\u201d that Piaget (1977\/1995, p. 184) grappled with\nin a series of essays published as the Sociological Studies\n(Chapman 1986; Kitchener 1986; Smith 1995). The ques-\ntion for Piaget was \u201cDo the operations by means of which\nwe attain what rational consciousness calls truth depend on\nsociety and, if so, in what sense?\u201d (p. 184). He criticized in-\ndividualism for neglecting the role of social life in trans-\nforming the individual\u2019s cognitive structures; in Piaget\u2019s\nwords, \u201chuman knowledge is essentially collective, and so-\ncial life constitutes an essential factor in the creation and\ngrowth of knowledge, both pre-scientific and scientific\u201d (Pi-\naget 1977\/1995, p. 30).\nOn the other hand, collectivism is also problematic for a\nnumber of reasons. One difficulty is that if knowledge is\nsimply passed on from the collective to the individual, how\nis it that individuals can question and criticize collective be-\nliefs? \u201cIf truth is something social, how can one distinguish\nlegitimate common representations from collective beliefs\nnot based on reason?\u201d (Piaget 1977\/1995, p. 197). Piaget\nalso criticized collectivism for not considering the influence\nof different types of social relationships on development\n(Carpendale & M\u00fcller 2004; Duveen 1997).\nAs an alternative to individualism or collectivism, Piaget\nargued for a third possibility, according to which it is rela-\ntions between individuals that are primary (Kitchener 1986,\nCh. 4; Smith 1995; see also Bunge 2000; Elias 1978): \u201cThe\nprimary fact, from this point of view, is neither the individ-\nual nor the set of individuals but the relationships among\nindividuals, a relationship constantly modifying individual\nconsciousnesses themselves\u201d (Piaget 1977\/1995, p. 136).\nThis position leads to a consideration of different types of\nrelationships and their influence on development: \u201cOne\nwill no longer be content to say that \u2018society\u2019 is the basis of\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 81\nlogic but will ask exactly what social relationships are in-\nvolved\u201d (p. 136). The two types of relationships that Piaget\n(1932\/1965b) described, forming the extremes of a contin-\nuum, were constraint and cooperation. Constraint involves\ninequality and views being imposed by authority, whereas\ncooperation involves interaction among equals.\nOur approach to the development of children\u2019s social un-\nderstanding focuses on the relations between people. From\na relational, action-based perspective the developing child is\nembedded in social interaction, and an involvement in social\nactivity itself is an integral part of constructing knowledge of\nthis activity. This activity simultaneously involves operative\ninteraction with the world as well as communicative interac-\ntion with other people (Chapman 1991; 1999). It is the mu-\ntuality of operative and communicative interaction that\nforms the basis of the constructivist position proposed here.\nAlthough we have focused on Piaget, a relational, em-\nbodied, constructivist approach to development could also\nbe based on other theorists (Bunge 2000; Elias 1978; Over-\nton 1998b). A number of approaches recognize the impor-\ntance of social interaction in development (e.g., Cole 1992;\nRogoff 1997; 1998), but this is not the place to exhaustively\nreview and critique them.2 The perspective we take is on\nthe psychological development of infants and children with\nthe assumption that such development occurs within the \ninfant\u2019s or child\u2019s activity \u2013 an activity matrix made up of \nbiological, social\/cultural, and psychological dimensions\n(Overton 1994). From this perspective, development be-\ngins from a point of relative lack of differentiation, and the\nchild\u2019s distinctions between self, other, and the world of ob-\njects emerge through activity in such a matrix.3\nAn issue that arises in regard to constructivism is that\nsuch approaches may appear to imply relativism. That is, if\nknowledge is constructed within social interaction, then,\nbecause social interaction may vary across cultures, it would\nappear that such knowledge would be specific to particular\ncultural groups. Moreover, there would be no way to eval-\nuate different forms of knowledge; all forms would be\nequally valid. That is, there are just different forms of\nknowledge and there is no way to be able to say one is bet-\nter than another. This \u201cconstructionist\u201d position (Gergen\n1994), therefore, collapses the distinction between devel-\nopment and mere change and amounts to relativism (for\nfurther discussion, see Chandler 1997). However, although\nthe constructivist position we endorse accepts that knowl-\nedge is constructed within interaction, there is still devel-\nopment in the sense that one form of knowledge is better,\nmore complete, or more adequate than other forms of\nknowledge (Chapman 1988b).\nAs a way to resolve this difficulty with relativism, Chap-\nman (1988b) distinguished progressivity in development\nfrom directionality toward a predetermined end point. Ac-\ncording to Chapman\u2019s (1988b) reading of Piaget\u2019s equili-\nbration theory, this theory was meant to address the ques-\ntion of \u201chow one form of thinking or knowing might be\njudged more or less \u2018advanced\u2019 than another\u201d (p. 97). After\nthe necessary first step of describing forms or stages of\nthinking, the next step for Piaget was to explain the process\nof development from one form of knowledge to another.\nDevelopment from this approach is progressive in the sense\nthat partial and incomplete perspectives are coordinated,\nresulting in more coherent and complete forms of knowl-\nedge. The process of equilibration is assumed to be univer-\nsal and progressive, but this does not imply a particular pre-\ndetermined end-state. Rather, development involves move-\nment away from an initial starting point of lack of knowl-\nedge (Chapman 1988b).\nIn the next subsection we discuss attempts to account for\nthe influence of social interaction on the development of\nchildren\u2019s social understanding at the level of particular the-\nories of children\u2019s social cognitive development.\n2.2. Accounting for the influence of interaction on\nchildren\u2019s social understanding\nThe issue of how to address the social dimension in devel-\nopment is of importance within debates over which is the\nbest theoretical account of children\u2019s understanding of\nmind, because each of the competing accounts must ex-\nplain the recent evidence suggesting that social interaction\ninfluences such development. Until recently, the discussion\nconcerning theories of children\u2019s \u201ctheories of mind\u201d pri-\nmarily consisted of debate among three dominant theories:\ntheory-theory, modularity theory, and simulation theory.\nThe pace and excitement of debate among these factions\nover the past decade has been frantic (for reviews see, e.g.,\nFlavell & Miller 1998; Hala & Carpendale 1997; Lewis &\nCarpendale 2002). However, because recent analyses have\nwitnessed much cross-fertilization between perspectives\n(see Carruthers & Smith 1996) the aim of this section is to\nhighlight common stress points within these positions. This\nsection briefly describes how the dominant theoretical per-\nspectives are still highly controversial. There are sufficient\ncritiques of each perspective for us not to dwell on individ-\nual theories. Instead, the focus will be on a fundamental\nflaw shared by all, thereby justifying the need for the alter-\nnative put forward in section 3.\nThe phrase \u201ctheories of mind\u201d signals the fact that the\ndominant theoretical position in research on mental state\nunderstanding has been that children construct theories of\nmental states which are similar to theories or paradigms in\nscience. Change occurs either because children acquire a\nmore sophisticated capability to represent mental state\nphenomena (Perner 1991), or because they modify their\ntheories in light of evidence that is not compatible with\ntheir current framework of understanding (Gopnik 1993;\nGopnik & Wellman 1992; 1994; Wellman 1990). Theory-\ntheorists claim that the child\u2019s understanding of mental\nstates is theory-like because this knowledge is coherent and\ndomain-specific, it shows a complex relation with the avail-\nable evidence, postulates unobservable entities, and, most\nimportant, undergoes \u201cparadigm shifts\u201d when the child\nabandons one set of principles for another in the face of suf-\nficient disconfirming evidence.\nStich and Nichols (1992) characterized a theory as a\n\u201cbody of rules or principles or propositions . . . which serve\nto guide the execution of the capacity to be explained\u201d\n(p. 35). Similarly, Gopnik and Wellman (1992; 1994) stated\nthat a theory is a system of interrelated laws or rules that\ncan be used to derive or infer predictions or explanations.\nIn other words, understanding a particular action requires\napplying the theory\u2019s laws and deriving a solution. The edi-\ntors of the special issue of Mind and Language (1992) in\nwhich two of these articles appeared suggested that such an\napproach is the most common strategy in cognitive science\nfor explaining the ability to negotiate a particular psycho-\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n82 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nlogical domain. For example, this is the dominant approach\nin the area of language, but even here it has been severely\ncriticized (e.g., Baker & Hacker 1984; Tomasello 1995b).\nCritics have long argued about whether the child\u2019s un-\nderstanding can be equated with theoretical postulates\nwithin scientific movements (e.g., Feldman 1992; German\n& Leslie 2000; Harris 1994a; Hobson 1991; Nelson et al.\n1998; Scholl & Leslie 2001). Russell (1992) argued that de-\nscribing children\u2019s understanding of mind in terms of a se-\nries of theories does not provide an account of develop-\nment. Gellatly (1997) claimed that drawing an analogy\nbetween cognitive development and historical change in\ntheories conflates different levels of discourse and neglects\nthe social dimension to child development and theory\nchange in science. Campbell and Bickhard (1993, p. 33)\nsuggested that if the term \u201ctheory\u201d is used loosely it is gen-\neral enough to include any form of human knowledge.\nThe view that children\u2019s understanding of mind is best\nexplained in terms of one or more innate modules resulting\nin a \u201chard-wired\u201d theory draws on arguments that the de-\nvelopment of such social understanding is simply too im-\nportant to be left to chance and that this understanding is\nacquired by children very early and without apparent effort\nor explicit teaching (e.g., Baron-Cohen 1995; German &\nLeslie 2000). The position that an innately given module or\nset of modules is triggered at some point in development\nwould seem to be the least consistent with developmental\nchanges in children\u2019s understanding of mind (Gopnik &\nWellman 1994). It lives uneasily with the accumulating ev-\nidence, such as the sibling effect described above, showing\nthat the nature of the social interaction children experience\nis closely related to the development of their social under-\nstanding. A further example is that secure attachment is as-\nsociated with early false belief understanding (Fonagy et al.\n1997; Meins 1997; Symons & Clark 2000). This might be\naccounted for from the innate perspective by assuming that\nattachment depends on innate temperament, but this ex-\nplanation is ruled out because the same infant can form dif-\nferent attachments with different adults (Meins et al. 1998).\nIn addition, Tomasello (1999b) has argued that there has\nnot been enough evolutionary time for the series of four\nmechanisms proposed by Baron-Cohen to have evolved.\nFurther, Moore (1996) has pointed out difficulties with\neach of the sources of evidence (i.e., animal lesion studies,\na study of neuroimaging, and studies of patients with brain\ndamage) advanced by Baron-Cohen (1995) for the exis-\ntence of modules or mechanisms. As in the debate over lan-\nguage development, we assume that there is agreement\nthat children must be biologically prepared to develop an\nunderstanding of mind. The debate concerns whether the\nsolution to this problem of understanding the mind is in-\nnately given or whether it is the capacity to develop such a\nsolution that has evolved.\nAccording to simulation theory, children develop an un-\nderstanding of mental states through introspection, and use\ntheir imagination to reason about psychological matters\n(Harris 1991; 2000). We agree that imagination must play\nan important role in children\u2019s reasoning about the mind,\nbut the introspective aspect of this approach is problematic\nfor a number of reasons. Simulation theory faces the prob-\nlem of how we can ever be confident that we can general-\nize our introspection to others (see Russell 1996, for a dis-\ncussion). A more important difficulty for simulation theory\nis that the assumption that children learn the meanings of\nmental state terms through introspection is vulnerable to\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1953\/1968) private language argument\n(Chapman 1987a; Montgomery 1997; Russell 1996). Witt-\ngenstein\u2019s argument \u2013 actually an anti-private language ar-\ngument or arguments (Russell 1996) \u2013 seems to establish\nthat children cannot learn the meanings of mental state\nterms just by introspection of their own inner experience.\nIn reviewing Wittgenstein\u2019s arguments we now move\nfrom the problems of the individual theories to a critique of\na fundamental assumption shared by all theories discussed\nso far. The assumption in these theories is that the problem\nthe child must overcome, through inference or introspec-\ntion, is to figure out what is going on in the private and hid-\nden realms of other minds. German and Leslie (2000,\np. 230) set up the \u201cfundamental problem of theory of mind\u201d\nas follows: \u201c[G]iven that beliefs, desires and pretends can\nbe neither seen, heard nor felt, how does the young brain\nsucceed in learning about them?\u201d It is just this causal psy-\nchological view of the mind that Wittgenstein rejected.\nWittgenstein (1953\/1968) argued that our language \u201cbe-\nwitches\u201d people into thinking of psychological matters as in-\nner objects, and his aim was to dispel misconceptions that\nour language leads one into. People assume that language\nrefers to things, and in the case of beliefs, desires, and in-\ntentions we assume inner objects, or representations, that\nare causally related to behavior. We contend that this as-\nsumption is common to most theories of children\u2019s \u201ctheo-\nries of mind\u201d and, that Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy can be ap-\nplied as a general critique of many current theories of social\ncognitive development (Racine 2004). Wittgenstein\u2019s goal,\nespecially his private language argument, was therapeutic\nbecause his intent was to clear the ground of misconcep-\ntions, and we aim to use his remedy to propose a construc-\ntivist cure for the currently ailing approaches to mental\nstate understanding.\nAlthough there is general agreement about the impor-\ntance of Wittgenstein\u2019s private language argument, there is\nconsiderable controversy regarding the meaning and im-\nplications, and even the location of the argument or ar-\nguments, in Wittgenstein\u2019s (1953\/1968) Philosophical In-\nvestigations (cf. ter Hark 1990).4 By a \u201cprivate language,\u201d\nWittgenstein did not mean a new language that has not yet\nbeen taught to anyone else, or a dying language only spo-\nken by one last speaker. Rather, a private language is radi-\ncally private in the sense that it is not possible to teach it to\nothers because it is based on private ostensive definition.\nWittgenstein\u2019s rejection of the idea that one could define\nwords privately is part of his critique of what he referred to\nas Augustine\u2019s view of language, according to which osten-\nsive definition is the foundation for language because \u201cit\ncorrelates words with things\u201d (Hacker 1990, p. 99). Among\nthe problems with this view of language, Wittgenstein\n(1953\/1968) showed, is that \u201can ostensive definition can be\nvariously interpreted in every case\u201d (para. 28; emphasis in\nthe original). An Augustinian might argue that the word-\nthing connection in language can be saved by the fact that\none can \u201cmentally point\u201d \u2013 that is, when it comes to inner\nsensations we simply direct our attention. Thus, privately or\nmentally pointing would be unambiguous. However, this\ntoo would not work because it would require a person to\n\u201cindividuate a particular mental activity \u2013 sensation or im-\npression \u2013 concentrate his attention on it, and label it\u201d\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 83\n(Williams 1999, p. 19). Hacker (1996, p. 132) argued that\nthere is nothing like mental pointing that could be similar\nto public pointing. One cannot concentrate one\u2019s attention\ninwardly and label a sensation. Thus, with regard to inter-\nnal private states, nothing \u201ccould logically count as remem-\nbering correctly or incorrectly\u201d (Hacker 1990, p. 108). This\nis just one aspect of Wittgenstein\u2019s general rejection of the\nwhole view of beliefs, desires, and intentions as inner ob-\njects that one could introspect on and label.\nPerhaps a more fundamental reason that words cannot\nbe defined privately is that meaning is not attached to\nwords, utterances, or representations in a mechanistic or\ndyadic manner (Goldberg 1991). Instead, meaning is based\non use, on shared practices with others. Wittgenstein\n(1953\/1968, para. 580) argued that \u201can \u2018inner process\u2019\nstands in need of outward criteria.\u201d\nAccording to Wittgenstein, the way to find out the meaning of\npsychological expressions is not to look inside the self, but to\nlook at the function that the respective words and concepts play\nin our language. This is because the meaning of such expres-\nsions is determined by the ways in which they are typically used,\nnot by the particular subjective impressions that we happen to\nhave in these situations. (Chapman 1987a, p. 107)\nIt is important to emphasize that the Wittgensteinian view\nof beliefs is very different from that assumed by most work\nin the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tradition. In Racine\u2019s words (per-\nsonal communication, November 2002),\nwhen people in the field speak of beliefs as mental contents,\nthey reify belief into a new form of mental content that is in-\ndependent of activity but yet causes activity. There are no such\ncontents. Belief exists and is created in action, not in the head.\nWe should not take the development of an ability to re-present\nactivities off line to be the development of an ability to experi-\nence inner states of belief. (see also Racine 2004)\nIt is this Wittgensteinian view of beliefs and intentions that\nwe assume in the alternative theory we propose in this tar-\nget article.\nWe should be clear that Wittgenstein was arguing against\nthe idea that introspection could be the way one learns the\nmeaning of psychological terms. But he did not rule out in-\ntrospection in some cases once someone has learned to talk\nabout the psychological world, such as in the following ex-\nample: \u201cDoes it make sense to ask: \u2018Do I really love her, or\nam I only pretending to myself?\u2019 and the process of intro-\nspection is the calling up of memories; of imagined possi-\nble situations, and of the feelings that one would have if . . .\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1953\/1968, para. 587; see also Hacker 1996,\np. 133). We should also emphasize that Wittgenstein was\nnot denying that one experiences sensations privately. This\nwas not the target of his private language argument. Rather,\nhe rejected the idea that it would be possible to learn the\nmeaning of psychological words through introspection.\nWe have pointed out some difficulties with the dominant\ntheoretical accounts of children\u2019s mentalistic understand-\ning (for further criticism see, e.g., Gellatly 1997; Hobson\n1991; Nelson et al. 1998; Russell 1996). There are, however,\ndifferent versions of these positions and we lack the space\nto do justice to the complexity of these theoretical ap-\nproaches. We also recognize that criticisms may be coun-\ntered with auxiliary hypotheses. These theoretical positions\nconverge on some points. That is, most theorists would\nagree that infants must be innately prepared to learn about\nthe social world, that their own inner experience must play\nsome role in the development of this understanding, that\nsuch knowledge is interconnected and changes with devel-\nopment, and that imagination is important in the process of\nsocial reasoning. Within such general agreement, however,\nthere is still much controversy, and there is an urgent need\nfor an alternative theoretical account that is more consis-\ntent with the accumulating evidence of the important role\nof social interaction in the development of children\u2019s social\nunderstanding.\nTo summarize our argument thus far, a common problem\nwith the dominant perspectives in the field is that each fo-\ncuses on the cognitive architecture of mental state reason-\ning, without reflecting on the social landscape in which such\nreasoning is constructed (Astington 1996; Lewis et al.\n1996). It is not by coincidence that recent discussion has be-\ngun to consider this social dimension as more central to de-\nvelopment (Astington & Baird, in press). Astington\u2019s (1996)\nVygotskian approach more explicitly includes such a social\ndimension. However, as we discussed in section 2.1, we\nmust carefully distinguish social constructionist approaches\nthat are equivalent to passive enculturation from social con-\nstructivist positions that also recognize the social dimension\nas essential but claim that passive adoption of cultural\nnorms cannot account for all development. So far, Asting-\nton (1996) has not been explicit on this issue, and the re-\nsulting ambiguity tends to lead to the enculturation inter-\npretation. Although Vygotsky\u2019s approach could be read as\nan enculturation theory, more complex readings are possi-\nble and more plausible (e.g., Fernyhough 1996). In section\n3 we construct an account that is in keeping with such a\nreading.\n3. A solution: Constructing an understanding \nof mind\nIn the preceding sections we contrasted approaches based\non the assumption that the development of an understand-\ning of mind is an individual process of introspection, matu-\nration, or the formation of a theory, with the contrasting po-\nsition that children acquire culture-specific concepts\nregarding the mind which are passed on from the social\ngroup. Instead of choosing between these two contrasting\npositions, we begin from a different starting point and en-\ndorse an alternative perspective emphasizing the relations\nbetween people (Piaget 1977\/1995). Concepts about the\nmind are not just passed on from the social group, nor are\nthey completely formed by individual child-theorists. In-\nstead, children gradually construct social understanding\nthrough the regularities they experience in interacting with\nothers.\nOur approach to the development of children\u2019s social un-\nderstanding is based on Chapman\u2019s (1991; 1999) reformu-\nlation of Piagetian theory emphasizing the social dimension\nin development. Piaget is now known for his emphasis on\nsubject-object interaction, even though in his early work\n(e.g., Piaget 1924\/1928), and continuing throughout his ca-\nreer (Piaget 1977\/1995) he was also concerned with the so-\ncial dimension of development (Chapman 1988a; Louren\u00e7o\n& Machado 1996). Vygotsky (1978; 1934\/1986), on the\nother hand, is known for his concern with the role of social\ninteraction in the development of higher mental functions.\nAn integration of subject-object interaction and social in-\nteraction results in a triangle \u201cconsisting of an active sub-\nject, the object of knowledge, and a (real or implicit) inter-\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n84 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nlocutor, together with their mutual relations,\u201d which Chap-\nman (1991, p. 211) termed the \u201cepistemic triangle.\u201d Chap-\nman argued that \u201calthough Piaget recognized the impor-\ntance of both operative and communicative forms of\ninteraction in various phases of his work, he never inte-\ngrated those components in a single model\u201d (p. 212). This\nepistemic, or \u201cknowing,\u201d triangle preserves the insights of\nPiaget and Vygotsky and facilitates thinking about how so-\ncial interaction and subject-object experience can be rec-\nonciled in development. The epistemic triangle has much\nin common with Hobson\u2019s (1994; 2002) notion of a \u201crelat-\nedness triangle,\u201d except that the latter focuses almost ex-\nclusively on affective engagement, particularly in infancy.\nChapman employed the notion of the epistemic triangle\nto describe the role of social interaction in the development\nof knowledge in the area of children\u2019s reasoning on concrete\noperational tasks (Carpendale 1999a; Carpendale et al.\n1996; Chapman & Lindenberger 1992). We take it to be the\nlowest common denominator for understanding develop-\nment in general and it is equally applicable to children\u2019s rea-\nsoning regarding social matters. The fundamental point is\nthat social interaction is essential in the development of\ncognitive, social, and moral knowledge. Children \u201cconstruct\na new conception of reality by coordinating their object-ori-\nented operative interactions with those of other people, by\nmeans of their communicative interactions with the indi-\nviduals in question\u201d (Chapman 1999, p. 34; emphasis in the\noriginal). At the same time that children are constructing\nknowledge of the physical world they are also constructing\nknowledge of other people. It is through communicative in-\nteraction that children discover that others sometimes have\ndifferent beliefs about the world. We take it that children\nassume a stable external world that remains the same for\nthemselves and other people. In order to maintain this \nassumption when they encounter others who may have dif-\nferent beliefs about aspects of the world, such as the loca-\ntion or identity of objects, children change their expecta-\ntions or their understanding of mind and of how beliefs are\nformed. At some point children realize that access to infor-\nmation, for example through seeing, is essential in the for-\nmation of beliefs. That is, children construct an under-\nstanding of how they and other people acquire knowledge\nof the world and they may achieve comparable levels of de-\nvelopment at similar ages because of commonalities in their\nexperience.\nFrom this perspective, knowledge is gradually con-\nstructed within social interaction. Children\u2019s social knowl-\nedge is based on action; it is not theoretical in the sense of\na set of laws formed on the basis of observation to explain\nthe doings of other people. Understanding others is at first\npractical. It is gradually constructed through regularities in\ninteraction with others. At first the interaction between in-\nfant and other (e.g., the caregiver or sibling) is dyadic and\nnot yet referential, but by the latter part of the first year this\ninteraction becomes triadic, between the infant, the care-\ngiver, and objects.5 That is, aspects of the world become in-\ncreasingly included in the interaction between infant and\ncaregiver. The infant is embedded in this triadic interaction\nbut only gradually differentiates the self, other people, and\nthe world of objects. In keeping with this gradual view of\ndevelopment, we expect to see children exhibit early forms\nof knowledge about the mind first in interaction; only later\nwill children become able to reflect on such knowledge.\nIn the following subsections we flesh out this view of de-\nvelopment in more detail, first briefly in development dur-\ning infancy and next when children begin to learn words.\n3.1. The development of the epistemic triangle: \nSocial understanding in infancy\nTriadic interaction between the child, another person, and\nthe world is essential in the development of knowledge in\ngeneral, and here we focus on social knowledge. This leads\nto the question of how and when the capacity for triadic in-\nteraction develops from an infant\u2019s dyadic interaction with\neither a parent or the world of objects. There is much de-\nbate and discussion concerning how and when infants\nachieve the capacity for triadic interaction \u2013 or move from\n\u201cprimary intersubjectivity\u201d to \u201csecondary intersubjectivity\u201d\n(Trevarthen 1979; Trevarthen & Hubley 1978).6 Examples\nof behavior involving triadic interaction begin toward the\nend of the first year of life and include social referencing,\ngaze following, and different forms of pointing. One of the\nearly manifestations of triadic interaction between the in-\nfant, an adult, and objects during infancy occurs at about 12\nmonths of age when infants start to point to objects (Schaf-\nfer 1977). Bates et al. (1976) distinguished between infants\u2019\nuse of pointing gestures in order to make requests (\u201cproto-\nimperatives\u201d) and pointing to direct adults\u2019 attention to ob-\njects (\u201cproto-declaratives\u201d). At this age, infants appear to be\nactively directing an adult\u2019s attention. These are two forms\nof behavior that at least appear to involve joint visual atten-\ntion. This capacity for joint attention plays an essential role\nin word learning during the second year (e.g., Baldwin\n1995; Lock 1980). The triangle between the infant, the par-\nent, and the world in action can be observed even earlier,\nat about 9 months of age, in the phenomenon of social ref-\nerencing, in which an infant apparently refers to a parent\u2019s\nfacial expression to determine their evaluation of an am-\nbiguous situation (e.g., Walden & Ogan 1988).\nAny claim about the age at which joint attention behav-\niors such as pointing, gaze following, and social referencing\ndevelop will be controversial. Different forms of these be-\nhaviors develop at different ages and, because there is\nmuch debate about what these behaviors may reveal con-\ncerning infants\u2019 social understanding, both rich and lean in-\nterpretations of this apparent evidence of early social un-\nderstanding in infancy are possible (Baldwin & Moses 1996;\nMoore & Corkum 1994). Richly interpreted, those behav-\niors involving joint visual attention seem to be evidence of\ninfants\u2019 understanding that other people have intentions\nand attention that can be directed to various aspects of the\nworld (Carpenter et al. 1998; Tomasello 1995a). The be-\nhaviors mentioned above have been interpreted as evi-\ndence that infants at this age already have an \u201cimplicit\u201d\n\u201ctheory of mind\u201d (Bretherton 1991; Bretherton et al. 1981).\nFrom the perspective of this rich interpretation, infants re-\nquire a mentalistic understanding of attention in order to\nengage in joint attention with adults and, therefore, this be-\nhavior reveals such an insight.\nTheorists taking a rich view of joint attention can be seen\nas falling within an individualist framework. According to\nthat framework, social development begins with the first\nperson perspective and the individual\u2019s own self-knowledge\nwhich then must be extended to others; that is, \u201cknowledge\nof other minds is parasitic on our knowledge of our own\nmind\u201d (Jopling 1993, p. 291). With this starting point for\nself-knowledge, the route to an explanation of understand-\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 85\ning other minds is usually through the analogical argument.\nThis argument has an extensive history. A current use of it\nby Meltzoff et al. (1999) is the following: \u201c(a) When I per-\nform that bodily act I have such and such a phenomenal ex-\nperience, (b) I recognize that others perform the same type\nof bodily act as me, (c) the other is sharing my behavioral\nstate; ergo, perhaps the other is having the same phenom-\nenal experience\u201d (p. 35). Tomasello (1999b, pp. 70\u201376;\n1999a, p. 68) also relied on the analogical argument in his\ntheorizing about infancy (although his theorizing concern-\ning language is consistent with ours).\nThe analogical argument relied on by the individualist\nframework is problematic for a number of reasons (e.g., ter\nHark 1990). For example, it seems to attribute too much to\nthe infant in counterfactual reasoning and the ability to take\nan external perspective on their own experience (Soffer\n1999). Analogical reasoning is possible once children have\nthe concept of self and other, but the argument already pre-\nsupposes this distinction and on that ground cannot logi-\ncally be its source (Scheler 1954, pp. 240\u201341). (For further\ncriticism of the analogical argument see M\u00fcller & Carpen-\ndale 2004.)\nMore recent accounts of joint attention support a leaner\ninterpretation. For example, Baldwin and Moses (1996) ex-\nplored development in triadic interaction in the context of\nsocial referencing and found that infants look at their moth-\ners under conditions of stress but not to gather information.\nThis suggests that triadic interaction may be important in\nfurther development of infants\u2019 social understanding, but at\n9\u201312 months of age it is only very rudimentary and is more\nlikely to be a manifestation of the attachment system than\nsocial understanding.\nThe most well-known lean account is that of Moore and\nCorkum (1994; Corkum & Moore 1995; 1998), who showed\nthat infants engage in joint visual attention, or end up in sit-\nuations in which their attention is coordinated with adults,\nthrough processes such as conditioning, without having yet\ndeveloped an understanding of attention (for a similar argu-\nment, see Kaye 1982). Rather than joint attention necessar-\nily revealing infants\u2019 understanding of other people\u2019s atten-\ntion, Moore and Corkum (1994) suggested that there are\ndevelopmental changes in infants\u2019 understanding of joint vi-\nsual attention. They provided evidence that around the end\nof the first year infants rely primarily on observing the adult\u2019s\nhead turn without apparently understanding the importance\nof eye direction. This appears to call into question the com-\nmonsense view that infants of this age understand that the\nother person is paying attention to the object. Later, during\nthe first half of the second year, infants begin to use eye di-\nrection information as well as the head turn to achieve joint\nvisual attention. This suggests that experience in which in-\nfants\u2019 attention is coordinated with adults\u2019 attention occurs\nbefore infants understand much about attention (Moore\n1999). The infant becomes embedded in interaction with\nsome success and only through the experience of that inter-\naction later develops a more complete understanding:\nOnce the infant is reliably engaging in joint attention, the ex-\nperiences offered by this new triadic interactive form of be-\nhavior will afford progress in the infant\u2019s conceptualization of\nattention and set the child on the road to the discovery of all\nforms of social life that rest on sharing attention with others.\n(Corkum & Moore 1995, pp. 81\u201382)\nThis position is also supported by research on infants\u2019\npointing (following Murphy & Messer 1977). Desrochers et\nal. (1995) reported that in a longitudinal study the majority\nof infants began to use noncommunicative pointing (i.e.,\npointing without looking at their mother) at 12 months of\nage. However, only beginning at 15 months did these same\ninfants begin to use pointing that seemed communicative\nin intent \u2013 for example, by simultaneously looking at their\nmothers to ensure they were successfully communicating.\nDesrochers et al. documented the development of increas-\ningly sophisticated forms of pointing between the ages of 12\nmonths and 18 months. Here again the evidence suggests\nthat infants engage in action such as pointing, which may\nresult in achieving joint visual attention or the coordination\nof attention with an adult, because the parent may attend\nto the object to which the infant is pointing. However, these\nyoung infants do not as yet appear to understand what they\nare doing because they do not look at the parent\u2019s face. In\nfurther exploring the development of pointing, Moore and\nD\u2019Entremont (2001) found that infants at age 1 year are\nmore likely to point when their parent is looking at them,\nwhereas at age 2 years they tend to point when their parent\nhad not seen an interesting sight. This suggests that young\ninfants point to enhance interaction, but older infants un-\nderstand pointing as directing others\u2019 attention.\nAnother reason for caution concerning the acceptance of\noverly rich interpretations of the meaning of early joint at-\ntention comes from research with nonhuman primates.\nChimpanzees can follow gaze, and on the surface their be-\nhavior looks surprisingly similar to that of infants, but\nPovinelli (1999) showed through a series of experiments\nthat chimpanzees do not appear to understand the psycho-\nlogical significance of gaze direction. For example, chim-\npanzees trained to beg with a hand-out gesture and given\nthe opportunity to beg for food from one of two experi-\nmenters sitting side-by-side are initially just as likely to beg\nfrom someone with her eyes closed, with her head turned\naway, or even with her head covered by a bucket as they are\nto beg from someone with her eyes open. It takes many tri-\nals for the chimpanzee to learn to beg from the person who\ncan actually see their begging gesture (Povinelli 1999).\nProponents of the lean interpretation of joint attention\nhave much in common with our position on infant social un-\nderstanding. In particular, Moore (1999) set the origins of\ninfant social understanding within triadic interaction\n(equivalent to subject, interlocutor, and object):\nOne might say that the 12-month-old recognizes intentional re-\nlations but only to the extent that she can share such a relation\nwith an interactive partner. For the 1-year-old, intentional re-\nlations exist in the interaction and are not a property of, or de-\nscriptive of, individuals. (Moore 1999, p. 48)\nHowever, Barresi and Moore\u2019s (1996) more detailed ac-\ncount starts from an individualistic perspective in which in-\nfants have different information about self and other and\nthe integration of these two sources of information leads to\nthe development of an understanding of self-other equiva-\nlence:\nAn individual organism\u2019s information about intentional rela-\ntions is available from two different sources. An organism has\ndirect first person information about its own intentional rela-\ntions and direct third person information about the intentional\nrelations of other agents. (Barresi & Moore 1996, p. 108)\nThis implies that a self-other distinction is already in place,\nwhereas from our perspective it is this distinction that re-\nquires an explanation.\nAn alternative approach that avoids these problems\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n86 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nwithin an individualist framework is the relational frame-\nwork (Jopling 1993), according to which the development\nof social understanding begins from relations between peo-\nple rather than from individual self-knowledge. The start-\ning point in development is a position of relative nondiffer-\nentiation between self, other, and the world (Baldwin 1906;\nHobson 1993; Merleau-Ponty 1964; Piaget 1936\/1963,\n1937\/1971; Vygotsky 1998; Werner & Kaplan 1963). From\nan observer\u2019s point of view one sees the infant interacting\nwith others and the world, but at first the infant has not con-\nstructed these distinctions. The differentiations between\ninner and outer, subject and object, and self and other oc-\ncur gradually within interaction (M\u00fcller & Runions 2003).\nThe process by which the infant shifts from participating in\ntriadic interactions to an understanding of the distinction\nbetween her own and others\u2019 intentions remains a holy grail\nwithin this area of theorization. However, only the con-\nstructivist perspective starts from a point where this prob-\nlem is not already \u201csolved\u201d \u2013 as stated above, accounts\nwithin the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tradition assume self-other dif-\nferentiation from the outset.\nA central assumption from a constructivist perspective is\nthat knowledge originates in activity. Infants interact dyad-\nically with the world of objects as well as with people, and\nthrough this activity they develop sensorimotor action\nschemes. Such schemes embody knowledge because they\nare modified as a function of the differences between what\nis anticipated and what the infant actually experiences\n(Chapman 1999). With further development, two or more\naction schemes may be combined, resulting in more objec-\ntivity or separateness from the infant\u2019s own action. The in-\nfant develops expectations about what can be done with ob-\njects as well as expectations about their interactions and\nroutines with people. And infants begin to regard people as\nindependent \u201ccenters of causality\u201d (Piaget 1937\/1971); that\nis, people do not always do what the infant expects or wants\n(Baldwin 1906). Different patterns of activity are possible\nwith people as compared to with objects. There has been a\ngreat deal of research attention devoted to the study of face-\nto-face dyadic interaction between infant and parent. In\nsuch interaction infant and parent respond to each other\nand this could be described as a form of communication but\nit does not yet refer to anything outside of this dyadic in-\nteraction (Chapman 1991). Objects may begin to be in-\ncluded in this interaction in routines such as giving and tak-\ning. From this perspective, infants first experience triadic\ninteraction that is supported by the parent or through\nprocesses such as infants learning to associate head turns\nwith interesting sights (Corkum & Moore 1998). At this\npoint infants still do not have a clear understanding of oth-\ners\u2019 attention; but over time they will construct such an un-\nderstanding through interaction (M\u00fcller & Runions 2003).\nDevelopment involves a process of gradually constructing\naction schemes and combining them. Infants slowly differ-\nentiate and coordinate their attentional directedness to-\nward objects with others\u2019 directedness toward objects\n(M\u00fcller & Carpendale 2004).\nHobson\u2019s (2002) relatedness triangle is a similar ap-\nproach that emphasizes the importance of the infant\u2019s emo-\ntional engagement. To this important insight, we add that\nthe infant\u2019s understanding of causality and spatial relations\nis also critical in the infant\u2019s ability to engage in joint atten-\ntion. This point is reflected in the various forms of gaze-fol-\nlowing that are observable from about age 3 months to age\n18 months. More complex forms of this social behavior,\nsuch as following an adult\u2019s gaze to an object behind the in-\nfant, require the infant to have an understanding of herself\nas an object within a world of other objects (M\u00fcller &\nCarpendale 2004).\nWhen infants have developed the capacity to coordinate\nattention with others they can refer to aspects of the world\nby directing others\u2019 attention, and they can understand\nother people\u2019s referential intent. Reference involves more\nthan just forming an association between a sign, usually ver-\nbal, and an action, as is the case in the few triadic chim-\npanzee gestures (Tomasello & Camaioni 1997). Instead,\nsigns can be used flexibly to convey different meaning in\ndifferent contexts, and this requires the ability to infer oth-\ners\u2019 referential intent.7 Recent \u201ctheory of mind\u201d research\non infancy has worked with inventive experimental proce-\ndures, but neglects an older tradition (e.g., Lock 1978;\nSchaffer 1984b) that attempted to chart the development\nof such signs within the richness of the infant\u2019s daily inter-\naction rituals and experiences. Our position is in keeping\nwith this tradition and the more recent view of Reddy\n(1991) that the rituals preverbal children engage in during\n\u201cteasing\u201d and \u201cmucking about\u201d show the beginnings of the\nprocess by which children come to share attention and to\nconstruct a practical or lived form of social understanding\nor knowledge of other people.\nThe ability to achieve joint attention and to understand\nother people\u2019s referential intent is the foundational insight\non which language is based (e.g., Baldwin 1995; Sinha\n1999). Tomasello (1999b; Tomasello et al. 1993) argued that\nit is this uniquely human ability that allows people to make\nuse of culture to a far greater extent than can other animals.\nThis ability is based on an initial level of social understand-\ning that gives infants the capacity to engage in triadic inter-\naction, and such interaction then provides a context for fur-\nther social cognitive development. Infants now start to use\nactions and words to refer to other things. Their communi-\ncation at this point becomes referential; that is, infants in-\ndicate what they want the adult to attend to and also are\nable to determine adults\u2019 referential intent. At this point,\n\u201cwords begin to mediate children\u2019s sensorimotor acquain-\ntance with reality. Children no longer know reality solely in\nterms of what they could do with it, but also in terms of what\nthey could potentially say (or hear) about it\u201d (Chapman\n1999, p. 34; emphasis in the original). All of the components\nof the epistemic triangle are now in place. In the next sec-\ntion we discuss how this new level of knowing provides a\ncontext for further development in children\u2019s understand-\ning of the social world.\n3.2. Outer criteria for inner processes: Talking about the\npsychological world\nAs infants develop the capacity to coordinate attention with\nothers, they begin to learn language. Children\u2019s word use is\nbuilt onto the shared practices they have already developed,\nsuch as following or directing another\u2019s attention, making\nrequests, and conveying their intentions or goals. Learning\nto talk is grafted onto prior ways of acting and interacting\nwith others. This is a view of language as activity, not just as\ninformation exchange. In this section we are concerned\nwith the development of children\u2019s ability to talk about the\npsychological world. This raises the issue of the relations\nbetween language and thinking. A common assumption is\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 87\nthat concepts are acquired first and then the words for such\nconcepts. In contrast, from a Wittgensteinian perspective,\nlanguage and thinking are much more tightly intertwined.\nWittgenstein (1981a, para. 324) asked, \u201cDoes a child learn\nonly to talk, or also to think? Does it learn the sense of mul-\ntiplication before or after it learns multiplication?\u201d We as-\nsume that the child learns about the concepts and the words\nat the same time. That is, learning the meaning of words to\ndo with multiplication involves learning the operations that\nare criterial for those words.\nThe research on children\u2019s language and their social un-\nderstanding initially used language as a window on chil-\ndren\u2019s understanding and tended to focus on words that\nseem most obviously to be mental state terms such as\n\u201cthink\u201d and \u201cknow.\u201d Other words, however, that are not ob-\nviously mental state terms at all (e.g., \u201chide\u201d) involve some\nunderstanding of how people know things and of how peo-\nple can be prevented from knowing things (Turnbull &\nCarpendale 1999a; for similar discussion see Russell 1992).\nIn fact, it would be difficult to draw a clear line between\nwords that do or do not turn on some understanding of the\npsychological world. Hacker (1991) pointed out that saying\na robot or an automatic door opener \u201csees\u201d something is\nparasitic on the primary use of such a verb. With reference\nto human agents, simple words such as \u201clook\u201d and \u201csee\u201d\nseem to refer to perception, but their correct use is tied to\nan understanding of the perceiver\u2019s psychological attributes\nwhen they attend to something. Learning the use of such\nwords is rooted in children\u2019s everyday experiences of coor-\ndinating attention with others. Children can be asked the\nfalse belief test question by referring only to where Maxi\nwould look (the \u201clook question\u201d) without use of the word\n\u201cthink.\u201d In fact, in some research young 3-year-olds seem to\npass this form of the test question before the \u201cthink\u201d ver-\nsion of the question (Chandler & Hala 1994; Hala & Chan-\ndler 1996). Similarly, 3-year-olds pass a false belief question\nphrased with \u201csay\u201d before a similar question phrased with\n\u201cthink\u201d (Nelson et al. 2003). The general point is that a great\ndeal of talk that is based on an understanding of knowledge\nacquisition and the mental world may not, in fact, involve\nwhat we would usually consider to be mental state terms\n(Turnbull & Carpendale 1999a).\nIn describing how children learn to talk about the psy-\nchological world it is necessary to draw on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nnotion of criteria. According to Chapman\u2019s operational se-\nmantic theory (Chapman 1999; Carpendale et al. 1996),\nchildren learn about the meaning of relational words such\nas \u201clonger\u201d through learning the operations that are criter-\nial for the use of such words. Children may come to under-\nstand that the meaning of \u201clonger\u201d in the case of length in-\nvolves the operation of checking to see which of two sticks\nprotrudes farther. Only through elaboration do children\nlearn the additional criterion of first lining up the ends of\nthe sticks. Terms like \u201clonger\u201d are also involved in other lan-\nguage games referring to time. In the present case of learn-\ning how to talk about the psychological world the criteria\nfor the use of such words are embedded within social in-\nteraction. As discussed above, Wittgenstein\u2019s (1953\/1968)\nprivate language argument stressed that it is not possible to\nlearn through introspection the meanings of words refer-\nring to inner processes (Chapman 1987a; Montgomery\n1997; Russell 1996). It follows from this that children learn\nabout inner processes (their own and other people\u2019s)\nthrough public criteria, not only through their subjective\nexperience; that is, they learn the appropriate contexts for\nthe use of various words referring to the psychological\nworld. Children learn the pattern of interaction for which\nit is appropriate to use a particular term, for example, men-\ntal or emotional, or dealing with pain, and so forth. Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s (1953\/1968) view of how children learn the meaning\nof sensation terms is that\nwords are connected with the primitive, the natural, expres-\nsions of the sensation and used in their place. A child has hurt\nhimself and he cries; and then adults talk to him and teach him\nexclamations and, later, sentences. They teach the child new\npain-behavior. (para. 244)\nWittgenstein\u2019s argument regarding sensation words also\napplies to psychological words (Chapman 1987a). Children\nlearn to talk about the psychological world in a variety of\nways including discussions about themselves and other peo-\nple. That children appear to develop the ability to under-\nstand another\u2019s belief at the same time as their own (Gop-\nnik 1993) would suggest that they learn the criteria for each\nat about the same time. Criteria for talk about the mental\nworld are behavioral evidence for inner experiences such as\nsensations, emotions, thinking, remembering, imagining,\nand so forth: \u201cCriteria are those publicly observable cir-\ncumstances which might be used in teaching the correct\nuse of the expression to a child or someone else learning our\nlanguage\u201d (Chapman 1987a, p. 105).\nFrom a Wittgensteinian perspective, the use of psycho-\nlogical terms becomes part of earlier, or more \u201cprimitive,\u201d\nprelinguistic behavior (Hacker 1997). Words such as \u201csee\u201d\nand \u201clook\u201d may be grafted onto earlier joint attention be-\nhaviors. These words can then be used as new ways to di-\nrect and follow attention. Similarly, emotion words may be\ngrafted onto the child\u2019s prior reactions or behaviors. The\ncircumstances surrounding the use of psychological words\nbecome the criteria for their use. Talk about the mental\nworld is built onto prior activities as a refinement (Canfield\n1993; 1999; Malcolm 1991; Turnbull & Carpendale 2001).\nIt might seem that if we endorse the Wittgensteinian idea\nthat children learn about the mental world through learn-\ning how to express in language their feelings, plans, goals,\nand so forth and through learning the criteria for the third\nperson use of various psychological terms, then we must en-\ndorse an enculturation position in which mentalistic con-\ncepts are imported from the social world to the individual.\nAs mentioned in section 2.1, this is one interpretation of\nWittgenstein and it implies a cultural relativism by which\nchildren would just learn the mental concepts used in their\nparticular culture. However, we do not endorse this inter-\npretation for two reasons. First, at the basic level of social\nunderstanding (e.g., seeing, looking, intentions, desires,\nand beliefs), children\u2019s understanding is built onto shared\npractices that we expect would be common across cultures\nbecause these are common aspects of human experience\n(for a parallel argument within the theory view, see Well-\nman 1998). This does not rule out that there may be cross-\ncultural variability, such as in complex emotions (Lillard\n1998).\nSecond, and central to our argument, children\u2019s devel-\nopment is constructive. This involves combining the epis-\ntemic triangle approach to development with Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s concept of criteria. That is, children do not acquire\nan understanding of talk about the psychological world in\nan all-or-nothing fashion. Concepts are not passed on,\nready-made, through language. Criteria are multiple and\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n88 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nchildren may initially acquire a subset, which enables them\nto use words apparently correctly in supportive contexts. It\nis only through communicative interaction with others\nabout beliefs (sometimes differing, sometimes concordant)\nabout the world, that children gradually construct an un-\nderstanding of belief. In other words, although young chil-\ndren often use and seem to understand words based on an\nunderstanding of the process of knowledge acquisition\n(e.g., \u201csee,\u201d \u201cremember,\u201d and \u201cguess\u201d), their understanding\nis as yet incomplete and is based on a partial set of the cri-\nteria for the correct use of such words (Montgomery 1997).\nFor example, Lillard (1993b) showed that when young chil-\ndren first begin to use the word \u201cpretend\u201d they focus on the\nmore obvious criterion of the action being performed\nrather than on the individual\u2019s knowledge or intentions.\nThis view is consistent with the generally protracted nature\nof language development (e.g., Nelson 1997).\nWe now turn to a consideration of other accounts of the\nrelation between language and social understanding. The\nfinding that various aspects of children\u2019s linguistic ability\nare associated with false belief performance has already\nbeen mentioned (e.g., Cutting & Dunn 1999; de Villiers\n2000; de Villiers & de Villiers 2000; Happ\u00e9 1995; Jenkins &\nAstington 1996). One approach is that language can be used\nas a window to reveal the child\u2019s social understanding.\nBartsch and Wellman\u2019s (1995; see also Sabbagh & Callanan\n1998) work exemplifies the usefulness of such research in\nthat it shows that children produce terms referring to de-\nsires before they refer to beliefs. However, one should be\ncareful of the assumption that mental terms refer to men-\ntal states. Even the simple word \u201cwant,\u201d which would be\ncoded as a desire term, can be used in many ways, such as\nto make requests or to make offers. Budwig (2002) found\nthat mothers and their children used the word \u201cwant\u201d in dif-\nferent ways. Regarding syntax, the de Villiers studies (e.g.,\nde Villiers & de Villiers 2000) showed that the child\u2019s grasp\nof the syntax of complementation (i.e., the fact that mental\nstate verbs necessarily take complementary clauses when\nthey refer to mental states, like other non-mental state\nverbs; e.g., He thinks that he had eggs for breakfast; He said\nthat he had eggs for breakfast) is correlated with false be-\nlief test performance. Such analyses suggest important con-\nnections between mental state understanding and the abil-\nity to parse statements about mental states. Longitudinal\nevidence indicates that language competence, as measured\nin standardized tests, appears to predate the development\nof false belief understanding (Astington & Jenkins 1999).\nEach piece of research shows how children\u2019s under-\nstanding of mental states is likely to be related to their gen-\neral proficiency in understanding and producing words and\nsentences. However, such correlations raise the issue of\ncausal direction, third factors, and the nature of any influ-\nence. Indeed, they are somewhat antithetical to our ap-\nproach because language and social understanding are so\nintertwined that it is somewhat artificial to separate human\nactivity into parts and call one part language and the other\nsocial understanding. This position follows, in part, from\nviewing language as activity (Turnbull 2003; Turnbull &\nCarpendale 1999a). However, if we do talk in terms of lan-\nguage and social understanding, then, from the perspective\nof the epistemic triangle, language is important for two rea-\nsons. Astington (2001, p. 686) has described these two roles,\nand the need for a resolution, as \u201ca means for representing\nfalse belief in contradistinction to the evidence given in re-\nality and it is also the means by which children become\naware of beliefs, both content and attitude. . . . What is\nneeded is a new conceptualization that reconciles and com-\nbines insights from both views.\u201d Although we may differ\nfrom Astington in what we mean by representation \u2013 from\nour perspective, language mediates children\u2019s knowledge of\nreality \u2013 children learn the criteria for words to talk about\nhuman activity and then can reflect on the psychological\nworld. Language, or communicative interaction, is the\nmeans through which children learn about other people\u2019s\nexperience and so develop a more complete set of criteria.\nParallel arguments have been made within more tradi-\ntional accounts. Harris (1996), in particular, had the insight\nthat conversation is important. Rather than mere exposure\nto mental state terms, Harris argued that conversation is\nimportant because it is a constant reminder that other peo-\nple have different perspectives. We agree that this is one\nrole conversation plays, but we contend that this is not suf-\nficient. Communicative interaction helps children realize\nwhen they only have a partial set of the criteria for using\nwords such as \u201c\u2018look,\u201d \u201csee,\u201d \u201cthink,\u201d and \u201cknow\u201d correctly,\nand when their understanding of the patterns of interaction\nin which these words are used is incomplete. Conversation\nhas a pivotal role within the epistemic triangle, but as part\nof an integrated system not as an independent factor. To\nmaintain the assumption that one lives in a common, stable,\nexternal world that is the same for the self and others \u2013 one\nof the basic presuppositions required in any attempt at\ncommunication \u2013 children must develop an increasingly so-\nphisticated understanding of the nature of the mind. Main-\ntaining the assumption of an independent external world in\nthe face of evidence of other people\u2019s differing experience\nof the world requires that children modify their under-\nstanding of the relations between their own and others\u2019 be-\nliefs about the world to include the notion that one\u2019s beliefs\nabout the world depend on the information to which one is\nexposed.\nOnce children can talk about the social, emotional, and\npsychological world, they can begin to reflect on or think\nabout people\u2019s activity in psychological terms (Chapman\n1991; Piaget 1945\/1962; Vygotsky 1934\/1986). This raises\nthe issue of how we view the process of reasoning. In the\ntheories we reviewed earlier in this target article, the\nprocess of reasoning involves simulation or the application\nof rules that are either innate or formulated by the child on\nthe basis of observation. In contrast, we suggest that chil-\ndren understand talk about the psychological world in\nterms of the patterns of activity that are criterial for the use\nof such mental state terms \u2013 that is, the pattern of interac-\ntion for which we use these words. Reasoning, then, in-\nvolves the coordination of these activities. Thus, as well as\nunderstanding questions in terms of human interaction,\nchildren also require the ability to imagine and coordinate\nactivities that may not be immediately present. From this\nperspective, reasoning is not based on the application of\nrules, but particular instances of rules would be manifest in\nthe process of reasoning (Carpendale et al. 1996).\n4. Using the epistemic triangle to explain the\n\u201ccore findings\u201d in \u201ctheory of mind\u201d and the \ninfluence of relationships\nIn this section we address the \u201cSo what?\u201d questions that nec-\nessarily follow in response to the proposed position in sec-\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 89\ntion 3. In section 4.1 we take the paradigm that appears to\nshow most clearly that a clear conceptual shift takes place\n\u2013 the false belief test \u2013 and compare a traditional theory-\ntheory account with the one offered here. In section 4.2 we\nexplore whether the theory presented here can go further\nthan previous ones in accounting for the correlations be-\ntween a range of social relationships, like the sibling effect,\nand mental state understanding. We suggest that it can do\nso more convincingly than any other account.\n4.1. The gradual acquisition of criteria within\nconversation\nWe are not the first to criticize the dominant accounts of\n\u201ctheory of mind\u201d development by suggesting that such skills\nare acquired gradually. Such gradualism has been explained\nwithin a framework of other arguments, like the protracted\ndevelopment of language (Nelson 1997), and from within a\nphilosophical critique of the theory-theory approach (Wood-\nfield 1996; see also Russell 1996). It is therefore important\nto outline how gradualism follows from our theoretical per-\nspective. Theory-theorists might depict a series of theories,\n\u201crudimentary prototheories\u201d (Ruffman 2000, p. 263) like\n\u201cpreliefs\u201d (Perner et al. 1994), or processing demands in\ndifferent procedures. This account can go only so far. How-\never, an argument based on gradualism cannot be an excuse\nfor fuzzy thinking. It needs a theoretical foundation and it\nneeds to provide an explanation of the data.\nThe notion of gradualism underlies the type of develop-\nmental approach taken by Piaget, and also Vygotsky. For ex-\nample, as Chandler (2001) has pointed out, in Piaget and\nInhelder\u2019s (1948\/1967) research on the development of\nchildren\u2019s understanding of visual perspective-taking they\ndescribed a sequence of different forms of understanding.\nThis developmental approach has often been lost in the\nsubsequent role-taking literature and the current \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d research. The strong tendency has been to collapse\nthis protracted development into a single transition point\n(Chandler 2001; Chandler & Carpendale 1998).\nThe view that an understanding of mind unfolds gradu-\nally may appear to be a nonstarter when the collected data\non the false belief test are examined. The recent meta-\nanalysis conducted by Wellman et al. (2001) attempted to\nidentify the factors that reliably facilitate performance in\nthe false belief test. In an analysis of 178 experiments with\n591 conditions, Wellman and colleagues found that factors\nlike the type of task used, or whether the target question fo-\ncused on the protagonist\u2019s thoughts or his or her actions,\nwere stable across studies. There seemed to be a clear con-\nceptual shift in children\u2019s performance at around age 4, and\nthis is consistent with the theory-theory account of devel-\nopmental change. However, consistent patterns of perfor-\nmance on one procedure do not necessarily inform us about\nthe nature of change \u2013 from our theoretical perspective\nthey may simply show that four-year-old children across the\nmany studies engage in sufficient interaction with others\nabout the veracity of beliefs to pass this test. As Scholl and\nLeslie (2001) noted, the meta-analysis might only show the\nsorts of improvement with age seen on most developmen-\ntal tasks.\nIndeed, proponents of the theory-theory perspective\nhave long warned us about the problem of \u201cneurotic task\nfixation\u201d (Gopnik et al. 1994, p. 157), and there are dangers\nin relying on only one task, particularly those versions of\nthat task which do not test the variations in performance. In\nWellman et al.\u2019s (2001) meta-analysis some types of studies\nwere not considered. Moses (2001) pointed out that among\nthe types of studies not included are studies involving ex-\nplanations of false beliefs, deceptive behavior, and eye\nmovements rather than verbal responses. Even within the\nhomogeneity of tests that were likely to lead to homogenous\nresults, there was still considerable variation among sam-\nples, and the authors found that\nseveral task manipulations do increase young children\u2019s perfor-\nmance: framing the task in terms of explicit deception or trick-\nery, involving the child in actively making the key transforma-\ntions, and high-lighting the salience of the protagonist\u2019s mental\nstate or reducing the salience of the contrasting real-world state\nof affairs, all help young children to perform better. (Wellman\net al. 2001, p. 672)\nTwo issues emerge from Wellman et al.\u2019s interpretation of\nthe collected false belief data, which are typical of the \u201cthe-\nory-theory\u201d approach to the literature: the extent of task\nvariation and its implications.\nIn contrast to the theory-theory, the constructivist view\nactually predicts that there will be variations in the child\u2019s\nacquisition of knowledge within a domain. For example,\nwhen exploring the development of children\u2019s social un-\nderstanding, Selman et al. (1983) found different levels of\nperspective taking when the child was involved in an activ-\nity than when the child was reflecting on it. The same analy-\nsis can be applied to the types of data reported by Wellman\net al. (2001) and the findings, listed above, which they chose\nto omit from their analysis. For example, Wellman et al.\nfound that if the protagonist\u2019s motive is made explicit or if\nthe child actively participates in the procedure (e.g., Chan-\ndler & Hala 1994; Hala & Chandler 1996) then preschool-\ners pass the test in greater numbers. Similar results are\nfound when child participants act out the answer by demon-\nstrating with a doll (Freeman et al. 1991). We propose that\nchildren do better on false belief tasks when they are ac-\ntively involved, because their understanding of the events\nis supported by the social interaction. Not only is their at-\ntention directed by the experimenter (within the epistemic\ntriangle, the subject-interlocutor interaction), but also their\ninvolvement in important aspects of the events commits\nthem to acting on the object of knowledge (the subject-ob-\nject of knowledge part of the triangle). Thus, children\u2019s\nthinking is supported by their practical activity within a dy-\nnamic triadic process. With further development in their\nability to hold different aspects of events in mind and coor-\ndinate them, children will be able to deal with false belief\nsituations at a more abstract level. This type of research pro-\nvides a snapshot of mental state understanding in the mak-\ning. It reveals a microcosm of relationships, which current\nstudies are showing to be vital and which explain patterns\nof findings to be revisited in section 4.2.\nA constructivist perspective would predict that the per-\nformance of children who are within the process of devel-\noping these insights would be influenced by many aspects\nof social interaction. Such gradualism is highlighted by re-\ncent research showing that there are other influences of the\ncontext of the assessment procedure. For example, there is\ninconsistency between laboratory-based assessment proce-\ndures \u2013 standard false belief tests \u2013 and naturalistic obser-\nvation of young children. Children typically pass standard\nfalse belief tests only by the age of approximately 4 years,\nwhereas in the home parents report observing their 2!s or\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n90 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nyoung 3-year-olds apparently demonstrating an under-\nstanding of false belief (Astington 2000; Newton et al.\n2000). In a diary study, Newton et al. (2000) found that par-\nents reported many incidents in which their young children\nwere involved in deception even though these children\nwere known to have failed false belief tasks. In agreement\nwith our position, Newton et al. suggested that rather than\nearly deception-reflecting insight, young children engage in\ndeceptive acts with only partial understanding and such ex-\nperience is the context for learning about deception.\nWellman et al. (2001) claimed that although factors such\nas the child\u2019s active involvement improved performance on\nfalse belief tasks, this evidence \u201cfailed to fit an early com-\npetence model\u201d (p. 674) because those factors \u201cdo not raise\nthe youngest children\u2019s performance to systematically\nabove-chance performance\u201d (p. 674) and there were no in-\nteractions between these task manipulations and age. Well-\nman et al. derived \u201cthe essential claim that such task factors\nmask early competence\u201d (p. 672). The difficulty with this in-\nterpretation is that Wellman et al. appear to have inter-\npreted arguments for gradualism within their own way of\nthinking about competence, resulting in the straw person\nthey term the \u201cearly competence model.\u201d Wellman et al.\u2019s\ninference is based on a prediction that the child either has\nor does not have false belief understanding, which may be\nhidden by performance factors. This is based on the as-\nsumption that competence is a hidden underlying factor\nthat causes performance (Chandler 1991). However, there\nare sufficient data showing how children are able to under-\nstand false beliefs at different times to support the claim\npresented here that we need to explore the process of\nchange in greater detail. The general problem is that if an\nindividual has developed a particular competence, why\ndoes he demonstrate it in some situations but not in others?\nIs this variability measurement error or evidence of gradual\ndevelopment?8\nVariability in performance across different tests is usually\nexplained in terms of performance factors masking the\nchild\u2019s competence. But, as Chapman (1987a) pointed out,\nit is not always possible to separate performance factors\nclearly from the underlying competence. The assumption\nthat there is one competence that is presumed to arrive all\nin one piece, like a theory or a set of rules, is what Chap-\nman (1987a) referred to as the \u201cmeasurement model.\u201d As\nan alternative approach he proposed the \u201cmembership\nmodel,\u201d according to which there are varying degrees of un-\nderstanding that are assessed with different procedures.\nHere we could say that degrees of membership, or compe-\ntence with mental state concepts, are related to children\u2019s\nincreasing grasp of the multiple criteria for words referring\nto the mental world and their ability to understand events\noutside of supported social contexts in their immediate\npractical activity.\nThe perspective we apply draws on Vygotskian (1978;\n1934\/1986) ideas according to which children\u2019s initial, frag-\nile social understanding, or \u201cunderstanding-in-action\u201d\n(Dunn 1996a), is at first evident when supported by social\ninteraction. Instead of naturalistic observation of early com-\npetence (e.g., Newton et al. 2000) being the application of\na theory, this type of experience is necessary to gradually\nconstruct social understanding. This claim that children\nbegin talking about the mental world with only a partial un-\nderstanding is consistent with work on language learning in\ngeneral (Nelson 1997). This is not, however, a simple adop-\ntion of culturally available concepts concerning the mental\nworld; rather, children must come to understand these con-\ncepts through becoming competent in using such words in\ntheir practical activity. Children\u2019s correct use of psycholog-\nical words is tied to their understanding of social situations\nand human activity. This understanding is facilitated by re-\nlationships that help the child understand other points of\nview. With experience in such social interaction concerning\nthe mental world, children\u2019s understanding becomes pro-\ngressively consolidated. That is, children are able to think\nabout situations abstracted from their practical context of\ninteraction and are able to anticipate and reason about sit-\nuations such as the false belief task. The ability to talk about\nthe mental world gives children a resource with which to re-\nflect on and understand others as well as themselves.\nThe fixation on false belief understanding has prevented\nus from examining the longer view of development. As\nChandler (1988) pointed out long ago, this initial under-\nstanding of the nature of beliefs and mind is not yet equiv-\nalent to a mature adult understanding of the mind. An un-\nderstanding of the possibility of false beliefs will not allow\nchildren to make sense of situations in which people with\naccess to exactly the same information still arrive at differ-\nent, but equally legitimate, interpretations of the same in-\nformation. A child with only an understanding of false be-\nliefs would assume that only one interpretation could\npossibly be right, and others must therefore be wrong. To\naccommodate the experience of interpretive diversity given\nthe same information, while maintaining the assumption of\na stable, independently existing external world, children\nslowly modify their understanding of the process of knowl-\nedge acquisition to achieve an understanding of the inter-\npretive nature of knowledge. So when children encounter\nsituations in which different beliefs are apparently based on\nthe very same information, they must revise their earlier\nunderstanding that beliefs depend on the information one\nis exposed to (i.e., false belief understanding) and develop\nan interpretive understanding of the mind (Carpendale &\nChandler 1996; Chandler & Lalonde 1996; Lalonde &\nChandler 2002). This early insight into the interpretive na-\nture of knowledge is a step toward a more mature under-\nstanding of mind, but there is still further development in\nunderstanding how knowledge is acquired during adoles-\ncence and adulthood (Carpendale & Chandler 1996; Chan-\ndler et al. 2001). Proponents of the dominant theories have\nbeen notably quiet about what happens in development af-\nter the child\u2019s fifth birthday. However, research that ex-\nplores whether 5-year-olds can use simple false belief\nknowledge to make inferences about their own and others\u2019\nperspectives finds that they singularly fail to do so (Varoux-\naki et al. 1999).\nIn addition to the content of talk about the mental world,\nthe approach we are proposing also implies that the nature\nof the parent-child relationship should be important in the\ndevelopment of children\u2019s social understanding through fa-\ncilitating children\u2019s understanding of the events and human\nactivities being talked about. We turn to this implication of\nour approach in the next subsection.\n4.2. The role of relationships in the construction \nof social understanding\nIn this section we return to the issues illustrated by the sib-\nling effect discussed earlier in this article (see sect. 1 and\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 91\nsect. 2.2). Any account of how the child comes to under-\nstand the psychological world must be able to explain a\nrange of other sources of evidence showing that mental\nstate understanding is significantly correlated with factors\nin the child\u2019s social environment, such as attachments, par-\nenting styles, and parent-child communication. In this sec-\ntion we argue that the importance of communication in ei-\nther facilitating or hindering the understanding of other\nperspectives directs our attention to the nature of commu-\nnication within different relationships. The sibling effect is\nimportant because it is a marker of the types of process hy-\npothesized here, but it is only one such marker. Dunn\n(1996a) has repeatedly reminded us of the important role\nof relationships in social cognitive development. What is\nneeded is a theoretical explanation of how relationships op-\nerate as a vehicle for the child\u2019s construction of the mind.\nThe idea of the epistemic triangle is useful in explaining this\ndevelopment because it is through becoming aware of other\npeople\u2019s beliefs, and coordinating these often differing per-\nspectives with their own beliefs, that children develop an\nunderstanding of mind. Through such interaction and by\nconfronting others\u2019 often differing beliefs about the world,\nchildren gradually construct a more complete understand-\ning that increasingly coordinates their own experience with\nthat of other people. It is partially the resistance or refrac-\ntoriness of social interaction that stimulates the develop-\nment of knowledge. Thus, we would expect that differences\nin the amount and nature of the social interaction experi-\nenced would be related to individual differences in infants\u2019\nearly social understanding, and to young children\u2019s further\ndeveloping mentalistic understanding. We will discuss two\nways of describing parent-child relationships: attachment\nand cooperation.\n4.2.1. Affective engagement and mental state under-\nstanding. A body of research in which social relationships\nare shown to correlate with social understanding has been\ninfluenced by attachment and psychodynamic theories\n(Fonagy & Target 1997; Hobson 1993; 2002; Meins 1997;\n1999). Fonagy et al. (1997) found that securely attached\nchildren, as measured with the Separation Anxiety Test, a\nprojective measure of attachment security, were more com-\npetent on theory of mind tasks than insecurely attached\nchildren. This positive relation between attachment secu-\nrity and false belief understanding has also been found with\na Q-sort measure of attachment (Symons & Clark 2000). In\na longitudinal study, Meins (1997) found that children who\nwere classified as securely attached at age 11 to 13 months\nwere more likely than insecurely attached children to pass\na false belief task at age 4 years, and more complex men-\ntalizing tasks at age 5 years (Meins et al. 1998). A relation\nbetween attachment and early social understanding in in-\nfancy was also reported by Bretherton et al. (1979). These\nresearchers found that children who were securely attached\nat age 12 months had used more protodeclarative pointing\nat age 11 months than other infants.\nThere have been a number of potentially compatible ex-\nplanations proposed for this positive relation between se-\ncure attachment and social understanding. Meins (1999;\nMeins et al. 2001) suggested that security of attachment\nand social cognitive development are positively associated\nbecause parents of children who develop secure attach-\nments respond sensitively and appropriately. To do this they\nneed to think of their children as persons with thoughts and\nfeelings and treat them in this way. That is, parents whose\nchildren develop secure attachments are \u201cmindminded\u201d;\nthey tend to \u201ctreat their infants as individuals with minds,\nrather than merely entities with needs that must be met\u201d\n(Meins 1999, p. 332). This way of interacting develops se-\ncure attachment, and it also exposes young children to talk\nabout the psychological world. Meins\u2019s explanation for the\nconnection between attachment security and social cogni-\ntive development is that the same parental characteristic\nthat results in secure attachment also results in the \u201cexpo-\nsure of the infant to mental state language\u201d (p. 337). She\nfound that maternal child-centered (mindminded) lan-\nguage (but not mindminded language about other people)\nto 6-month-olds predicted children\u2019s false belief perfor-\nmance at age 4 (Meins et al. 2002). This evidence requires\nan explanation of how exposure to mental state language in-\nfluences social development, which is what we have pro-\nvided here.\nAt a level at which theories of affect and cognition are in-\ntegrated, it is not too difficult to show how analyses of in-\nfant-caregiver affect are wholly compatible with data on\nparent-infant shared attention. Indeed, Hobson (2002,\np. 147) argued that security of attachment, which is based\non the mother\u2019s way of relating to the infant, may influence\nthe infant\u2019s ability to engage with others, and it is this \nengagement that is essential in interaction in the \u201crelated-\nness triangle\u201d and in the development of thinking, espe-\ncially thinking about the social world. From the vantage\npoint of observations of interactions, Baldwin and Moses\n(1996) pointed out that internal working models consist of\nknowledge of other people and relationships. That is, in-\nfants develop expectations about other people based on pri-\nmary relationships. Such views echo one another and fit\ninto the framework of our general developmental theory,\nwhich extends beyond infancy. Perhaps we should not be\nsurprised that such a way of viewing internal working mod-\nels converges with Piagetian ideas about development be-\ning rooted in interaction because one likely source of\nBowlby\u2019s ideas was Piaget\u2019s notion of schemes. Piaget\n(1945\/1962, pp. 188\u201389, 206\u2013207) wrote about the \u201caffec-\ntive schemes\u201d or \u201cpersonal schemes\u201d that infants develop as\n\u201cmodes of feeling and reacting\u201d to people in ways that\nsound like internal working models \u2013 the set of expectations\ninfants build up about other people and how they will act.\nThis is early sensorimotor, lived, practical knowledge about\npeople based on expectations acquired through experience\nof how parents respond.\nResearch on the development of affective exchange in in-\nfancy has greatly illuminated key issues in infant develop-\nment. The correlations between such exchanges and tests\nof later mental state understanding suggest a need for a\nbroader explanatory framework. One possibility is that se-\ncure attachment is an indicator of a relatively cooperative\nparent-child relationship, and, as we will argue in the next\nsection, this is the type of relationship that, according to\nconstructivist theory, facilitates the development of knowl-\nedge.\n4.2.2. Cooperation versus constraint. Exploration of the\nnature of parent-child relationships has led to interest in the\ninfluence of parenting style on social cognitive develop-\nment (Astington 1996; Vinden 2001). Ruffman et al.\u2019s\n(1999) data show that parents who reported that they dealt\nwith disciplinary situations by asking their child to \u201creflect\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n92 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\non the victim\u2019s feelings\u201d (p. 406) had children who were\nmore advanced in false belief understanding. In addition,\ncooperative interaction is related to and may facilitate the\ndevelopment of children\u2019s social understanding. Dunn and\ncolleagues (1991) found that cooperative sibling interaction\nwas related to successful false belief explanations. Also,\nBrown et al. (1996) reported that cooperative interactions\nwith friends and siblings were related to children\u2019s frequent\nuse of mental state terms. Such evidence needs a theoreti-\ncal explanation.\nIf, as Chapman (1991; 1999) argued, knowledge of the\nworld develops through coordinating other people\u2019s per-\nspectives with one\u2019s own within the epistemic triangle, then\naspects of relationships and communication that facilitate\nour understanding of other people\u2019s perspectives should\nhave a positive effect on development. An aspect of rela-\ntionships that was important in Piaget\u2019s (1932\/1965b; 1977\/\n1995) work on moral judgment is the degree of constraint\nversus cooperation present in relationships. This analysis is\nrelevant for our discussion because development, accord-\ning to Piaget (1932\/1965b), is facilitated by relationships of\ncooperation and mutual respect and hindered by relation-\nships of constraint and unilateral respect; cooperation fa-\ncilitates understanding. Cooperative relationships have the\npotential of approaching Habermas\u2019s (1983\/1990) concep-\ntion of the ideal conditions of unrestrained communication,\nallowing all participants to understand each other\u2019s posi-\ntions fully and arrive at solutions to conflicts that everyone\ncan agree with. In our terms, if understanding is gradually\nconstructed by the child within triadic interaction, then it\nfollows that the extent and nature of cooperation between\nthe child and others are important.\nIt follows from a constructivist perspective that coopera-\ntive relationships, allowing free communication between\nparents and children, should facilitate the development of\nan understanding of mind. Parents differ in how much they\nfeel obliged to justify their positions and listen to their chil-\ndren\u2019s perspective and, thus, in how much cooperation they\nallow or encourage in their relationships with their chil-\ndren. Relationships among parents and children that are\nmore cooperative than constraining should facilitate chil-\ndren\u2019s understanding of other people\u2019s points of view. This\ninterpretation is consistent with research showing that\nparental styles (Baumrind 1991) differing in the extent to\nwhich parents reason with their children differentially af-\nfect child development. Cooperative relationships are the\nideal context for the development of knowledge, but this\nalone is not sufficient. Talk about a substantive connection\nto the world is also required (D\u00f6bert 2004) \u2013 in this case\ntalk about people\u2019s activity in terms of their goals, beliefs,\nand desires. Various experiences such as cooperative peer\ninteraction in the context of role enactment and shared pre-\ntense may contribute to the development of mental state\nunderstanding largely due to the stimulation of interaction\nand conversation.9\nOf course, these correlations do not allow us to draw\ncausal conclusions. The parent-child relationship is a sys-\ntem that is influenced by characteristics of both the child\nand the parents. It is important to acknowledge that rela-\ntionships involve the child as well as the parent, and, al-\nthough the influence of parents tends to be emphasized,\nthat characteristics of the child also influence the nature of\nthe parent-child relationship (Bell 1968; Symons & Clark\n2000). Parents\u2019 ability to engage with their child may be in-\nfluenced by their beliefs about parenting (e.g., Baumrind\n1991; Ruffman et al. 1999; Vinden 2001) and emotions\n(Hooven et al. 1995), as well as by the parents\u2019 level of\nstress, depression and psychiatric disorders, patience, social\nsupport, socioeconomic circumstances, and education.\nOn the other hand, the extent to which parents can be\ncooperative and can support the child\u2019s reasoning will partly\ndepend on, and interact with, the child\u2019s abilities and char-\nacteristics. The child\u2019s developmental level may influence\nthe nature of the relationship because children who are\nmore advanced in language and social cognitive develop-\nment may be easier to interact with in a cooperative man-\nner.10 Individual differences on the child\u2019s part may vary\nfrom extremes such as autism,11 which severely restricts the\nchild\u2019s ability to engage in triadic interaction as evidenced\nby the lack of protodeclaritives at 18 months of age (Hob-\nson 1993), to differences in ability to focus and maintain at-\ntention (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsiveness, distractability).\nBlindness also makes joint attention more difficult to\nachieve and for that reason seems to hinder the develop-\nment of social understanding (Minter et al. 1998; Peterson\net al. 2000). We agree with Hobson (1993; 2002) that such\nfactors on the child\u2019s part influence the ability to engage in\ninterpersonal relatedness, as well as the nature of that in-\nteraction, and it is such interaction that is essential in social\ncognitive development. In this target article we have re-\nstricted our analysis to the study of human development,\nbut the same principles could be extended to nonhuman\nprimates.12\n5. Conclusion and future directions\nWhat benefits can be gained by adopting a constructivist\napproach to the development of children\u2019s social under-\nstanding? For a start we have summarized examples of a vo-\nluminous literature that relates an understanding of mental\nstates to a range of social experiences. Traditional accounts\nof \u201ctheory of mind\u201d can only go so far in adding to the list\nof social influences on the child simulator\/theoretician be-\nfore coming to realize that a social dimension has to be in-\ncorporated into such theories. The theory presented here\nsets out to do two things. First, it attempts to establish from\nthe start that social processes are a necessary part of any ac-\ncount of how children come to construct an understanding\nof their social world: from infant dyadic interaction through\nto complex social skills beyond simple false belief under-\nstanding. Second, it has revisited and reworked the con-\nstructivist account of development and used this to reassert\nits central focus on action and the potential for examining\nknowledge acquisition as a social process. For us, a con-\nstructivist approach to understanding the child\u2019s grasp of\nthe social world is the only possible solution to the impasse\nbetween individual and social perspectives on social under-\nstanding and the problem this reveals in the assumption\nthat the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d metaphor makes about the de-\nvelopment of knowledge and meaning: that the child has to\nlearn about the workings of the mind through inference or\nintrospection. For us, following Wittgenstein, \u201cas a human\nactivity \u2018meaning\u2019 is best thought of as a verb, not a noun\u201d\n(Shotter 1978, p. 46).\nBy providing a framework that integrates social and cog-\nnitive processes, the analysis presented here calls for new\ndirections in research based on the relations between par-\nticular forms of interaction and the development of social\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 93\nknowledge. Here we suggest some required shifts in the re-\nsearch agenda, as a means of illustrating how the implica-\ntions of our position are very different from those offered\nby theorists within the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d tradition. We refer\nto five areas of urgently needed research.\nThis research agenda begins in infancy with the study of\nthe development of \u201cshared meaning\u201d (Chapman 1999,\np. 34). This is one of the most difficult and important prob-\nlems in developmental psychology. We have pointed out\nflaws in other approaches and provided a firm foundation\nand the tools with which to build an account of the devel-\nopment of infants\u2019 ability to grasp others\u2019 referential intent\n(see also M\u00fcller & Carpendale 2004). But we acknowledge\nthat the sketch we have provided is, as yet, partial. Re-\nsearchers must begin by addressing the process by which\nthe infant engages in interaction and joint attention. In do-\ning so, we suggest that longitudinal naturalistic observation\nof infant-parent interaction and infants\u2019 joint attention\nwould complement the current experimental research\n(e.g., Moore & D\u2019Entremont 2001). Ironically, such natu-\nralistic research was more common 25 years ago (e.g., Bates\net al. 1976; Lock 1978; Schaffer 1977). What is needed is a\ndetailed analysis of infants\u2019 interaction and the emergence\nof social referencing, gaze following, and pointing, as well\nas a study of the context of the ongoing sequence of inter-\naction in which the act is embedded. Some contemporary\nresearch of this sort does already exist (Reddy 1991) and we\nsuggest that such work may help solve the riddle of how\nself-other differentiation and coordination emerge during\ninfancy. According to the view adopted here, and in contrast\nto the position held in the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d accounts of in-\nfancy, \u201cthe child\u2019s understanding is not just a matter of rec-\nognizing a correspondence between the mother\u2019s words\nand reality, but of grasping her referential intent in that sit-\nuation \u2013 knowing what one is meant to attend to in response\nto her words and gestures\u201d (Chapman 1999, p 34; empha-\nsis in the original).\nSecond, we need to move from the intriguing findings re-\nlating individual differences in the social experiences of in-\nfants and their social understanding to research that ex-\nplores the processes involved. For example, the findings of\nMeins et al. (2002) are intriguing, but how is it that moth-\ners\u2019 tendency to talk about their infants in psychological\nterms is positively associated with their child\u2019s understand-\ning of false beliefs almost four years later? What is it about\nthe nature of these parents\u2019 interactions with their infants\nthat correlates with the development of social understand-\ning? Such research turns our attention to the nature of par-\nent-child interaction and developing talk about the psycho-\nlogical world, and our theory provides a framework for this\nresearch. For example, such studies should examine how\nthe criteria for the use of mental state terms are displayed\n(Turnbull & Carpendale 1999a; 2001). Differences be-\ntween families in the ways in which criteria are made evi-\ndent could also be studied. It is important to remember that\nresearchers studying talk about the psychological world\nshould be concerned not just with mental state terms but\nmore broadly with talk about human activity (see sect. 4.1).\nThird, and related to the points above, the gradual view\nof development implied in an activity-based theory such as\nours means that researchers need to study forms of under-\nstanding even before children are able to explicitly explain\nfalse beliefs. One way to approach this issue is by manipu-\nlating the tasks to discover what factors facilitate young chil-\ndren\u2019s reasoning within the context of the assessment pro-\ncedure. This type of research \u2013 and a considerable amount\nof such research has been conducted (e.g., Lewis &\nMitchell 1994) \u2013 should be used to think about the nature\nof development, not merely to search for \u201cearly compe-\ntence.\u201d This would involve an extension of research using\nnovel approaches to assess children\u2019s grasp of an actor\u2019s be-\nliefs. For example, Call and Tomasello\u2019s (1999) nonverbal\nfalse belief procedure could well be used to tap early forms\nof understanding, just as it has been used to reveal a com-\npetence in deaf children (Figueras-Costa & Harris 2001;\nsee also Carpenter et al. 2002). There is still scope to make\na closer inspection of how children respond during tradi-\ntional tests of false belief. For example, an interesting\nsource of evidence of an early form of understanding comes\nfrom within the theory-theory and is referred to as \u201cimplicit\nknowledge\u201d of false belief (Clements & Perner 1994; Cle-\nments et al. 2000; Garnham & Ruffman 2001). This work\nseems to demonstrate that young children, even slightly be-\nfore their third birthday, respond to a prompt in a false be-\nlief test by looking in the direction of the correct container,\neven though these same children then go on to fail a more\nstandard verbal question. Clements and Perner (1994) de-\nscribe this knowledge as implicit because it cannot be ver-\nbalized. It has more recently been referred to as \u201cnonver-\nbal theory of mind\u201d (Ruffman 2000), but we point out that\nalthough the child\u2019s response is not verbalized it is in re-\nsponse to a verbal prompt. Not only might research on this\neffect illuminate potentially interesting processes by which\nchildren come to construct an understanding of the false\nbelief task (e.g., the nature of the criteria they use), it would\nalso free theory-theory from the contortions it has to make\nto incorporate such evidence into its developmental ac-\ncount.\nFourth, we need to explore more closely just what it\nmeans for a child to \u201chave\u201d an understanding of belief, in\norder to move beyond overly simple accounts of theoretical\ntransitions at age 4 years. As well as expecting gradual de-\nvelopment in different forms of understanding, we also \npredict and would investigate unevenness in development\nbetween different areas of children\u2019s experience. Some\nchildren may have more experience and therefore more un-\nderstanding of particular aspects of social understanding.\nFor example, in a recent study, Peskin and Ardino (2003)\nfound that children\u2019s performance on a false belief task in\nwhich an object is moved to a new location without the\nknowledge of the protagonist (\u201cunexpected transfer task\u201d)\nis positively associated with success in a hide-and-seek\ngame, whereas children\u2019s performance on a false belief task\nin which a container has unexpected contents (\u201cunexpected\ncontents task\u201d) is positively associated with success in keep-\ning a secret from one of the experimenters about a birthday\ncake wrapped in a bag. Such data are clearly compatible\nwith a constructivist account.\nFifth and finally, and as stated above, researchers need to\nmove away from age\/stage fixation to explore what happens\nto children after age 4 years. For a start, children cannot\nnecessarily use the knowledge they demonstrate in the\nstandard false belief test. A recent study by Maridaki-Kas-\nsotaki et al. (2003) found that in Greek, in which two terms\nare used synonymously to mean \u201cto look for,\u201d a version of\nthe false belief test with one verb appeared to facilitate 3-\nyear-olds\u2019 performance, whereas its synonym hampered\nperformance in 5-year-olds. Such data reveal that children\u2019s\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n94 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nunderstanding of questions about beliefs is mediated by\ntheir understanding of verbs referring to mental states.\nFurther work along these lines would reveal more about the\nprocess by which children come to acquire the subtleties of\na mature understanding of mind \u2013 particularly knowledge\nand skills that make up the complexity of a culture\u2019s psy-\nchology (Lillard 1998). The approach put forward here\nstresses the need to explore the matrix of social relation-\nships involving transactions between the child and others\nand in which the child constructs social understanding.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIn developing the ideas presented in this target article we have\nbenefited from discussions with Ulrich M\u00fcller, Bill Turnbull, and\nTim Racine. We also thank Chris Moore, Vasu Reddy, and the ref-\nerees for helpful comments on an earlier draft.\nNOTES\n1. It is not clear that an enculturation approach is directly\nchampioned by any theorist within the \u201ctheories of mind\u201d litera-\nture, but such an approach is discussed by many (e.g., Astington\n1996; Astington & Olson 1995) and sometimes attributed to\nWittgenstein or Bruner (1990).\n2. Rogoff (1997, p. 266) criticized internalization approaches\nand argued instead for \u201cdevelopment as a process of transforma-\ntion of participation.\u201d Although there is much that we agree with\nin Rogoff \u2019s approach, her view of internalization involves either\nthe transmission or acquisition of information (corresponding to\ncollectivism or individualism, respectively) \u2013 both being examples\nof what Overton (1994; 1998b) termed a \u201csplitting\u201d or \u201cisolation\u201d\nstrategy. Rogoff (see also Matusov 1998) critiqued a particular\nview of the nature of internalization. We agree with the critique.\nHowever, there is a second view of internalization (Lawrence &\nValsiner 1993), according to which internalization involves the\nchild\u2019s reconstruction of knowledge rather than transmission. In-\nteraction is internalized (or \u201cinteriorized,\u201d in Piaget\u2019s terminology)\nto the extent that the child can implicitly perform the act and does\nnot actually have to enact the activity (Carpendale et al. 1996;\nChapman 1991; 1999).\n3. There are other positions such as Thelen and Smith\u2019s (1994;\nThelen et al. 2001) dynamic systems approach that are consistent\nin many ways with the approach we take. Thelen and Smith\u2019s ac-\ncount is similar to Piaget\u2019s theory in emphasizing the practical and\nembodied nature of cognition. And Chapman (1992; see also\nBoom 2004) suggested that Piaget\u2019s theory was an early theory of\nself-organization. However, there may also be important differ-\nences. In Thelen and colleagues\u2019 (2001) explanation of the A not\nB error they appear to assume objectivity, whereas that is what Pi-\naget tried to explain (M\u00fcller & Carpendale 2001). This suggests\nthat they started from a different beginning point in development.\n4. We cannot survey here the extensive literature on Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s private language argument, but we do need to at least re-\nspond to Kripke\u2019s (1982) interpretation. Kripke began from\nWittgenstein\u2019s claim that all rules are up for interpretation. This is\nthe paradox that \u201cno course of action could be determined by a\nrule, because every course of action can be made out to accord\nwith the rule\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953\/1968, para. 201). From this,\nKripke derived the radically skeptical position that there can be\nno such thing as rule following, and this also applies to language\nsince word use is rule following. This implies that the apparent\nmeaningfulness of language must be an illusion and language must\nbe meaningless. Kripke ended up in this radically skeptical posi-\ntion because he refused to give up the idea that rules are inter-\npreted. But Wittgenstein was, in fact, arguing against this external\nexplanation that there is a middle step of interpretation in apply-\ning a rule. Ironically, Wittgenstein was setting up the paradox that\nthe range of interpretation is infinite to show that rule following\ncannot consist of interpretation \u2013 that \u201cinterpretations by them-\nselves do not determine meaning\u201d (para. 198). In the same section\nthat Kripke focused on, Wittgenstein went on to write, \u201cIt can be\nseen that there is a misunderstanding here. . . . What this shows is\nthat there is a way of grasping a rule that is not an interpretation\u201d\n( para. 201). Then, in paragraph 202, \u201cAnd hence also \u2018obeying a\nrule\u2019 is a practice\u201d (McDowell 1984; Russell 1987). Wittgenstein\u2019s\nposition is internalist: that is, it is not possible to separate the rule\nand the application (ter Hark 1990, Chap. 3).\n5. Triadic interaction here refers to interaction involving self,\nother, and the world, not to interaction among three people.\n6. However, Trevarthen took an innatist approach to explain-\ning this development, whereas we do not.\n7. We recognize that reference is a controversial issue (Putnam\n1988). To be clear about our position, we do not consider refer-\nence to involve a dyadic relation between a sign and the thing re-\nferred to. This would seem to require a mechanistic view of mean-\ning in which meaning is assumed to be attached to representations\n(Goldberg 1991). Instead, we consider reference to involve a tri-\nadic relation between the self, others, and an aspect of the world\n(Carpendale 1999b; Chapman 1991; 1999; Sinha 1999). Thus,\nmeaning is not fixed to signs, but signs are used to direct others\u2019\nattention and shared meaning is achieved through ongoing social\ninteraction (Turnbull 2003; Turnbull & Carpendale 1999b).\n8. Variability in children\u2019s performance on false belief tasks is\nreminiscent of similar debates in other areas of research. The most\nwell-known example is criticism of Piaget\u2019s theory concerning\n\u201chorizontal decalage.\u201d The standard interpretation of Piaget\u2019s the-\nory was as a theory of mental logic, according to which reasoning\ninvolves the application of a logical rule. A prediction derived from\nthis interpretation is that, once a child has developed such a rule,\nhe or she should be able to solve all problems based on the same\nunderlying logical rule. It is well known, of course, that there is\nconsiderable evidence of variability in children\u2019s performance on\ntasks that are all apparently based on the same logical principle.\nThe research literature provides other examples of similar diffi-\nculties in explaining evidence of variability in performance on dif-\nferent tasks that apparently should all be assessing the same com-\npetence. For example, in research on Kohlberg\u2019s theory of moral\ndevelopment, much more variability in the stage of moral reason-\ning employed was found than had been predicted by Kohlberg\n(e.g., Carpendale 2000). A particularly good example of the same\nsort of issue arose in the role-taking literature (e.g., Chandler\n2001).\nAs argued elsewhere (Carpendale et al. 1996; Chapman 1987b),\nhorizontal decalage is only problematic when it is assumed that Pi-\naget\u2019s theory is a theory of mental logic. From the perspective of\nan interpretation of Piagetian theory emphasizing the origin of\nknowledge in action, horizontal decalage is not a problem (Chap-\nman 1987b; 1988; Louren\u00e7o & Machado 1996). Instead, it should\nbe expected. Similarly, variability in performance on different\nfalse belief tasks is only a problem because it clashes with a com-\nmon and implicit assumption about the nature of reasoning \u2013 that\nis, the view of reasoning as being based on the development of\nrules or principles which are then applied to problems to gener-\nate solutions (in domains such as moral reasoning or reasoning\nabout the physical world, and now the social world).\n9. Pretend play has been considered as a possible facilitating\ncontext for the development of social understanding, that is, as a\n\u201czone of proximal development\u201d (Lillard 1993a; Youngblade &\nDunn 1995). The overall amount of pretend play has not been\nfound to be associated with false belief understanding, but false\nbelief understanding is associated with specific types of pretend\nplay: when children make joint proposals in their pretend play and\nwhen they explicitly make role assignments to themselves and\ntheir partners in play (Astington & Jenkins 1995). Also, young chil-\ndren\u2019s tendency to role enact is associated with belief under-\nstanding seven months later (Youngblade & Dunn 1995). From\nour perspective, we would expect that increased social under-\nstanding would facilitate children\u2019s ability to engage in coopera-\ntive pretend play, and that this social interaction could also serve\nas one context, among others, for further social development. We\nCarpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 95\nwould not expect that any facilitative effect would depend only on\nthe fact that pretense is involved, but rather also on the fact that\nsuch situations would require cooperative interaction in which\nchildren must coordinate their activity toward shared goals. This\nwould require talking about human activity and the need to reach\nmutual understanding because the children are enacting some\nevent together.\n10. In considering the role of the child\u2019s abilities we recognize\nthat our approach needs to be integrated with domain general ap-\nproaches to children\u2019s reasoning about the mind (e.g., Frye et al.\n1995a; Gordon & Olson 1998; Mitchell & Riggs 2000). The child\nmust have an ability to pay attention to important aspects of social\ninteraction and must be capable of achieving some distance be-\ntween himself and the situation so he can reflect on it rather than\nact impulsively (Moses 2001). Furthermore, reasoning about sit-\nuations that are not immediately present would require the abil-\nity hold in mind and to imagine aspects of situations (Harris 2000).\nClearly, there is some distance to go in developing this aspect of\nour approach, but we suggest that a likely candidate for further\nstudy would be attentional capacity, which in Chapman\u2019s (1987b)\napproach has a role in understanding and reasoning.\n11. Concerning autism, our position is consistent with Hob-\nson\u2019s (1993; 2002) view of autism as due to a disruption in the\nchild\u2019s ability to engage in affective interaction. In this article we\nhave spelled out in further detail the nature of this interaction be-\nyond infancy and the role of language in social cognitive develop-\nment. However, we have not applied the issue of autism to our an-\nalytic framework because it is associated with so many other social\nand cognitive problems and differences from the typically devel-\noping population that no conclusive statement can be made here.\n12. This focus on the role of relationships in development, as\nwell as what the child brings to the relationship, allows us to think\nabout both atypical development and research with nonhuman\nprimates. Here our approach is consistent with Tomasello\u2019s\n(1999b) position that what is required in typical social cognitive\ndevelopment is both normal neurological development as well as\nthe right social and cultural conditions. In children with autism we\nsee biological abnormalities hindering the children\u2019s ability to en-\ngage with others in ways that are essential to normal social cogni-\ntive development, even though they have access to normal human\nsocial interaction (Hobson 1993). \u201cEnculturated\u201d apes \u2013 that is,\nchimpanzees and bonobos raised in a human linguistic environ-\nment \u2013 do develop more social cognitive and language skills than\nwild chimpanzees, but they can only go so far \u2013 not much beyond\nthe level of a 2-year-old human child (Savage-Rumbaugh et al.\n1993).\nOpen Peer Commentary\nCommentary submitted by the qualified professional readership of this\njournal will be considered for publication in a later issue as Continuing\nCommentary on this article.

This social construc-\ntivist view needs to be clear about the complementary contributions of the\nchild and of the social environment. I distinguish between the child\u2019s in-\ndividual linguistic ability and the dyad\u2019s social communication, proposing\nthat each makes a contribution to theory-of-mind development, differ-\nently balanced in different individuals.\nRejecting two contrasting paradigms, Carpendale & Lewis (C&L)\noffer their explanation of children\u2019s theory-of-mind development\nas a supposedly new alternative to existing theories. On one hand,\nthey reject explanations that posit theory development, simula-\ntion, or innate modules because these are too focused on au-\ntonomous individual development. On the other hand, they reject\nenculturation explanations because, in their view, such explana-\ntions allow the child no active role. The internalist theories that\nthey reject are well described and supported in the literature,\nwhereas, as they concede, the externalist view is hard to find (per-\nhaps it is best, if briefly, exemplified in Rogoff et al. 1993).\nSocial construction. I agree with C&L that we need an expla-\nnation integrating the individual and social aspects of develop-\nment; and I am sympathetic to their account, accepting it as an al-\nternative to the internalist, individualistic explanations and the\nexternalist, passive enculturation explanation, all of which the au-\nthors explicitly reject. I find it harder, however, to regard theirs as\na particularly novel approach. Although some terms and details\nmay differ, it is best located within an existing group of social con-\nstructivist explanations of children\u2019s developing understanding of\nmind (e.g., Boyes et al. 1997; Dunn 1996b; Fernyhough 1996;\nGarfield et al. 2001; Harris 1999; Montgomery 2002; Nelson 1996;\nShatz 1994). I would also place my own views here \u2013 let me re-\nsolve, in passing, the ambiguity that C&L detect in my earlier writ-\ning (e.g., Astington 1996; Astington & Olson 1995). I do not be-\nlieve that children\u2019s theory of mind develops by a process of\npassive enculturation. In my view, it is an error to assume that \u201ccul-\ntural concepts can be acquired from participation in a social con-\ntext simply because they are manifest there\u201d (Astington & Olson\n1995, p. 186).\nAlthough I accept that there is need for \u201can alternative theoret-\nical account that is more consistent with the accumulating evidence\nof the important role of social interaction in the development of\nchildren\u2019s social understanding\u201d (target article, sect. 2.2, penulti-\nmate para.), I would argue that a number of such alternative ac-\ncounts already exist in the literature. C&L share with Nelson\n(1996) and Montgomery (2002) the Wittgensteinian idea of ac-\nquiring meaning from use; they share with Harris (1999) and Fer-\nnyhough (1996) the idea that children are exposed to variation in\nbelief as they enter into conversation with others; they share with\nDunn (1996b) a focus on the relations between people; and so on.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n96 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nHence, C&L\u2019s proposal falls in with an existing set of theories\nthat children\u2019s understanding of mind is collaboratively con-\nstructed in linguistically mediated social interaction. Their account\naccords a central role to triadic interaction involving a dyad \u2013 the\nchild and another person \u2013 communicating about some object or\naspect of the world. What is needed is a more detailed and precise\naccount of the mechanism whereby this leads to an understanding\nof mind. From a social constructivist perspective, it is important to\nbe precise about those abilities of the child that allow for partici-\npation in the constructive activity, lest we slip back into passive en-\nculturation. Perhaps by distinguishing between children\u2019s individ-\nual linguistic ability and their participation in dyadic linguistic\ninteractions (although obviously these two are related), we will be\nable to formulate a social constructivist view that recognizes the\ncontribution both of the child and of the social environment.\nLanguage and communication. It is problematic that C&L use\nthree terms somewhat interchangeably: social interaction, com-\nmunicative interaction, and language. In my view, it is important\nto distinguish clearly among these. One could use the term \n\u201clanguage\u201d to refer to the child\u2019s individual linguistic ability and\n\u201csocial interaction\u201d to refer to the joint activity within triadic in-\nteraction, reserving the term \u201ccommunicative interaction\u201d for dis-\ncourse-based social interaction (although this last may be less than\nsatisfactory because it obscures the importance of nonverbal com-\nmunication). My point is that, defined in this way, language and\nsocial interaction\/communication may play different and comple-\nmentary roles in theory-of-mind development and, further, that\nthere may be both individual and developmental differences in\ntheir relative importance. Some evidence exists in support of this\nsuggestion.\nFirst, deaf children with deaf parents develop false-belief un-\nderstanding within the typical time frame, whereas deaf children\nwith hearing parents do not do so (Peterson & Siegal 2000). Both\nsets of children engage in triadic social interaction, which is com-\nmunicative even if nonverbal. However, only the children with\ndeaf parents develop language \u2013 sign language \u2013 within the typi-\ncal time frame. This suggests that the child\u2019s individual linguistic\nability plays a role in the development of theory of mind inde-\npendent of that played by social communication.\nSecond, children with autism have deficits in theory of mind\nand in the development of communication and language skills.\nHigh-functioning children with autism do develop false-belief un-\nderstanding, but later than typically developing children do.\nMoreover, those who do pass false-belief tasks have a higher level\nof general language ability than that of typically developing chil-\ndren who can pass false-belief tests (Happ\u00e9 1995). This suggests\nthat the autistic children are using their individual language skills\nto compensate for their lack of social communicative interaction\n(Tager-Flusberg 2002).\nThird, there is evidence for the interaction of family size (in-\ndicative of the amount of child-child social activity) and individual\nlanguage ability in theory-of-mind development (Jenkins & Ast-\nington 1996). We showed that the false-belief test performance of\nchildren with lower language ability and two siblings was equal to\nthat of children with higher language ability and no siblings,\nwhereas children with lower language abilities and no siblings per-\nformed more poorly. This suggests that individual language skills\nand social interaction both contribute to theory-of mind develop-\nment and that either one of these can compensate for a deficit in\nthe other.\nFourth, in a training study designed to develop false-belief un-\nderstanding (Lohmann & Tomasello 2003), positive effects were\nfound in two conditions: conversation about deceptive objects (us-\ning no mental terms and no syntactic complementation in the dis-\ncourse) and specific training on the syntax of complementation (in\nthe absence of deceptive objects). Moreover, the largest effect was\nfound in a condition where these two were combined (conversa-\ntion and complements). Again, this suggests that social interactive\ndiscourse and individual language abilities make somewhat inde-\npendent contributions to theory-of-mind development.\nDifferent routes to common outcomes. In conclusion, I would\nargue that theory of mind is a fundamentally important aspect of\nhuman development which is likely to be overdetermined. That\nis, it is likely that there is more than one cause of its development\n\u2013 individual linguistic ability and social interaction are two dis-\ncussed here \u2013 with different balances in different individuals, and\nperhaps with the balance shifting over developmental time, as\nHughes et al. (2002) suggest.\nThe role of social experience in advanced\nsocial understanding\nRobin Banerjee\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9QH,\nUnited Kingdom. R.A.Banerjee@sussex.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.cogs.susx.ac.uk\/users\/robinb\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) rightly emphasise the central role\nof social interaction in the development of children\u2019s understanding of\nmind. Further support and justification for their theoretical focus are pro-\nvided by research on advanced reasoning about socio-emotional and so-\ncio-motivational processes. Variability in social experience can explain\nboth developmental change and within-age-group differences in such so-\ncial understanding.\nIn the constructivist framework presented by Carpendale & Lewis\n(C&L), a central role is assigned to children\u2019s social experience as\nan essential foundation for gradual social-cognitive development.\nThe authors indicate the potential significance of findings regard-\ning relatively advanced (beyond five years of age) reasoning about\nthe psychological and social worlds, especially in view of evidence\nthat simple false-belief measures have only limited value for pre-\ndicting variability in children\u2019s everyday social behaviour. Brief\nreference is made to children\u2019s understanding of the interpretive\nnature of knowledge (e.g., Carpendale & Chandler 1996), but the\nanalysis would be strengthened by considering additional evi-\ndence regarding primary schoolchildren\u2019s cognition about the\nemotional and motivational processes involved in everyday social\ninteraction. Both developmental change and within-age-group\ndifferences in this social understanding reflect children\u2019s experi-\nences of social interaction. Indeed, Dunn\u2019s (1996a) insightful \nreminder to address the role of social relationships in social un-\nderstanding should hold through the course of childhood social-\ncognitive development.\nResearch on social cognition has demonstrated many develop-\nmental changes beyond the age of five years. Taking emotion un-\nderstanding as an example, we see primary school children learn-\ning about self-regulation (in terms of both private coping and\npublic display), about emotional ambivalence, and about complex\nemotions involving reflections on the self, on others, and on social\nstandards (e.g., Meerum Terwogt & Stegge 1996). Similarly, re-\nsearchers have developed a range of advanced theory-of-mind\ntasks covering, for example, children\u2019s reasoning about second-or-\nder false beliefs (e.g., Sullivan et al. 1994), about faux pas (Baron-\nCohen et al. 1999), and about irony, sarcasm, and double bluff\n(Happ\u00e9 1994). There is also evidence of change in children\u2019s\nbroader understanding of people, such as in their conception of\ndispositions or traits (e.g., Yuill & Pearson 1998). Research on\nthese topics may provide strong evidence concerning the role of\nsocial interaction in children\u2019s social understanding.\nOne feature of advanced social understanding emphasised by\nCarpendale and Chandler (1996) concerns the fact that different\npeople may hold varying beliefs about the same perceptual stim-\nuli. In that paper, the authors found that only from around seven\nor eight years of age did children appreciate the validity of mul-\ntiple interpretations of a range of stimuli (e.g., in the domains \nof lexical ambiguity, ambiguous line drawings, and ambiguous\nreferential communication). It is reasonable to suppose that this \nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 97\ndevelopment must at least in part reflect children\u2019s growing expe-\nrience of situations that lend themselves to varying interpretations\nand evaluations. In particular, peer interactions are likely to en-\ncourage children to gain the mature insight that exposure to the\nsame information can lead to varying beliefs about the world.\nRecent theoretical and empirical work on children\u2019s use and un-\nderstanding of self-presentation is consistent with this emphasis\non peer interactions. Self-presentational behaviour involves an at-\ntempt to control the way one is evaluated by others, and success\nin this goal depends largely on an appreciation of how character-\nistics and events are represented by others. Hence, as children\ngrow older and peer-group acceptance becomes an increasingly\nimportant goal (e.g., Parker & Gottman 1989), others\u2019 beliefs must\nbe judged with regard not just to their informational content but\nalso to their evaluative content. Consistent with this evidence,\nBanerjee and Yuill (1999) found that children\u2019s spontaneous iden-\ntification of self-presentational motives for deceptive emotional\ndisplays (e.g., not wanting to appear babyish or stupid) emerged\nat around eight years of age, lagging behind their identification of\nprosocial motives. Furthermore, such identification of self-pre-\nsentational motives was found in a separate study to be associated\nwith the attribution of embarrassment (Banerjee 2002a). In a sim-\nilar vein, children\u2019s tendency to make appropriate use of informa-\ntion about an audience\u2019s preferences when choosing between self-\ndescriptive options also increased at eight years. Importantly,\nwithin-age-group variability in this tendency was positively asso-\nciated with a sociometric measure of reciprocated peer nomina-\ntions (Banerjee 2002b). Although work on this topic is in its early\nstages, there is good reason to suppose that children\u2019s reasoning\nabout self-presentational motives and related social emotions,\nsuch as embarrassment, depends on their experience of specific\ntypes of social interaction. Indeed, this argument is consistent\nwith Higgins and Parsons\u2019s (1985) broader discussion of how\nchanges in children\u2019s social lives \u2013 including the increasing expo-\nsure to social agents with different dispositions, intentions, and\npreferences \u2013 are likely to play a critical role in shaping their cog-\nnition about the social world.\nThe appreciation of evaluative beliefs is just one of many as-\npects of social understanding that continue to develop in middle\nchildhood and beyond. Researchers have already begun to iden-\ntify social experience \u2013 involving various social agents (e.g., par-\nents, siblings, and peers) \u2013 as playing a significant role in this de-\nvelopmental process. Two important related issues should be\nconsidered in any examination of this area. First, with respect to\nambiguities about causal direction, we must recognise that chil-\ndren\u2019s social understanding necessarily develops in the context of\ntheir social experience. Even if we were able to specify context-\ngeneral prerequisites (e.g., understanding recursive mental repre-\nsentations), it simply does not make sense to talk about children\u2019s\nreasoning about self-presentation, or faux pas, or embarrassment\nwithout emphasising the social dimension. In these and other in-\nstances of reasoning about socio-emotional and socio-motivational\nprocesses, social understanding has to develop out of, and feed\nback into, children\u2019s social experience. Second, a major strength\nof the theoretical orientation presented by C&L lies in its poten-\ntial ability to explain both between- and within-age-group vari-\nability. Such variability has been observed in early mental-state\nreasoning, and researchers have found predictive value in chil-\ndren\u2019s interactions with parents, siblings, and peers. Now we are\nbeginning to identify substantial variability in responses to more\nadvanced tasks, not just between younger and older primary\nschool children, but also within any given classroom of children.\nC&L\u2019s framework provides further impetus to investigate the so-\ncial experiences that give rise to these differences. Such work will\nhelp us meet the further challenge of predicting and intervening\nin the development of problems in social understanding.\nEven an \u201cepistemic triangle\u201d has three sides\nJohn Barresi and Chris Moore\nDepartment of Psychology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H\n4J1, Canada. jbarresi@dal.ca moorec@dal.ca\nhttp:\/\/jbarresi.psychology.dal.ca\nAbstract: By focusing primarily on communication between adult and\nchild and on adult-set criteria for appropriate action, Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s\n(C&L\u2019s) account of the development of social understanding in the epis-\ntemic triangle tends toward an enculturation view, while diminishing the\nrole of individuals. What their proposed mechanism fails to acknowledge\nis that the two agents in the epistemic triangle necessarily have indepen-\ndent perspectives of the object and of each other.\nWe strongly agree with Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) that the child\ndevelops social understanding primarily through engagement\nwith other individuals in what Chapman (1991) called the \u201cepis-\ntemic triangle.\u201d But we fail to see how their use of this triangle\nprovides them with a way to chart a middle course between the\nScylla of individualism and the Charybdis of enculturation. When\nit comes to describing actual mechanisms of development in the\nepistemic triangle, we find their account both incomplete and po-\ntentially biased in the direction of enculturation.\nC&L\u2019s discussion of mechanisms involved in the development\nof social understanding tends to use a particular interpretation of\nWittgenstein\u2019s views on language learning. According to this ac-\ncount, it is socially implemented feedback involving behavioral\n\u201ccriteria\u201d that shapes the child\u2019s use and understanding of lan-\nguage in general and mental language in particular. But if this is\nthe primary mechanism for the development of social under-\nstanding of mental life, it fails to satisfy. Despite the authors\u2019\nclaims to the contrary, it does not differentiate their account from\na general model of learning based on enculturation. For, even if\nparticular triadic interactions are the locus of language and other\nlearning, this mechanism appears to use teachers as carriers of lin-\nguistic and other social or cultural knowledge. Hence, the partic-\nular agents in the interaction, with their individual uniqueness,\nplay an unclear role in the acquisition of language, and, presum-\nably, in the development of social understanding in general.\nThe authors claim that their view is not an enculturation view\nbecause it allows for certain basic-level \u201cshared practices\u201d in so-\ncial understanding of \u201cseeing, looking, intentions, desires, and be-\nliefs\u201d that are fundamentally universal, hence not culture-relative.\nHow this could save them from the socially constituted pole of en-\nculturation is not obvious, unless it implies that the learning of\nsuch practices does not depend on language learning. But then,\nwhat does it depend on? One is tempted to answer: \u201ca theory of\nmind\u201d; but obviously this is not their answer. They also argue that\nthey have a constructive account of development because the\nepistemic triangle is combined with the concept of criteria. Again\ntheir description here fails to explain adequately how the epis-\ntemic triangle plays a role different from that of criteria. This is\napparent in their final summation: \u201cWe suggest that children un-\nderstand talk about the psychological world in terms of the pat-\nterns of activity that are criterial for the use of such mental state\nterms \u2013 that is, the pattern of interaction for which we use these\nwords\u201d (sect. 3.2, last para.). Nothing is stated here about univer-\nsal practices or of the role of epistemic states \u2013 just culturally de-\nfined criteria. It may be that a richer interpretation of Wittgen-\nstein could save this account, one which recognizes first-person\ncriteria for mental meanings to go along with public third-person\ncriteria, but this is not the Wittgenstein that C&L provide.\nThe nub of the problem is that C&L fail to take seriously the\ntriadic structure of the epistemic triangle. This structure involves\nthree vertices (i.e., the infant, the adult, and the object) as well as\nthree sides (i.e., the dyadic communicative relation between in-\nfant and adult, the infant\u2019s relation to the object, and the adult\u2019s\nrelation to the object). By focusing on the communication be-\ntween adult and infant and on adult-set criteria for appropriate ac-\ntion toward the object, they fail to recognize that the two agents\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n98 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nin the epistemic triangle necessarily have independent perspec-\ntives of the object, and of each other.\nThe same problem arises elsewhere in their account, particu-\nlarly in the section dealing with the infant\u2019s initial entry into the\nepistemic triangle toward the end of the first year of life. In this\nsection they briefly describe our own theory of social understand-\ning (Barresi & Moore 1996). Because we talk of \u201cfirst-person in-\nformation\u201d as one component entering into the epistemic triangle,\nC&L claim that our model, despite pretensions otherwise, must\nbe individualistic. But this claim both misrepresents our model\nand refuses to recognize an essentially individualistic aspect of the\nepistemic triangle \u2013 the two agents who, even in shared activity,\nnecessarily have distinct intentions, goals, and perspectives in\ntheir relations with each other and to the object.\nWe believe that the account in Barresi and Moore (1996) is\nmore sensitive to the structure of the epistemic triangle and to the\nmechanisms involved in social understanding than that given by\nC&L. We argue that the infant first comes to understand mental\nphenomena by sharing with another individual an activity toward\nan object, whether that activity involves actions, emotional or mo-\ntivational relations, or epistemic relations, all of which we treat as\nvarious forms of what we call \u201cintentional relations.\u201d This sharing,\nwhether initially achieved through behavioral or emotional conta-\ngion, conditioning, imitation, or any other means, provides the\nground for developing a reflective representation of that form of\nintentional activity. The key point is that such a representation in-\nvolves the joining together of both first-person information and\nthird-person information about the common intentional relations\ninvolved in such triadic interactions.\nWe further suggest that in integrating information about two\nsides of the epistemic triangle (i.e., each agent\u2019s intentional rela-\ntion to the object), in the context of an interaction about this com-\nmon activity, the infant does not initially represent this activity as\ninvolving independent actions of self and other. Instead, at this\nearly phase in development, the sources of information are not yet\ndistinguished as originating from distinct individuals, and the un-\nderstanding of the intentional relation is best described as one of\nunderstanding what \u201cwe\u201d are doing. So, on our account, it is fun-\ndamentally an understanding of a shared activity, not one of un-\nderstanding that self and other, as distinct agents, share in an ac-\ntivity. Nevertheless, it is from such initial understanding of\ncommon activities in triadic situations that the infant eventually\ndevelops an understanding of self and other as distinct agents with\ntheir own individual intentional relations. Moreover, it is always\nout of shared activity with others that advances in understanding\nof mental phenomena are first made (see Barresi & Moore 1993).\nThis is because it is only in such shared activities that the first- and\nthird-person aspects of such mental phenomena may be recog-\nnized as belonging together, thus laying a foundation for eventu-\nally using either the first- or third-person aspect alone to recog-\nnize the mental state of self or other.\nArticulating the role of experience in mental\nstate understanding: A challenge for\ntheory-theory and other theories\nKaren Bartsch and David Estes\nPsychology Department, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071.\nbartsch@uwyo.edu estes@uwyo.edu\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) proposal of a social interaction\naccount makes clear the need for researchers of all theoretical orientations\nto get specific about how social experience influences children\u2019s develop-\ning understanding of mind, but it is premature to reject other theories,\nsuch as theory-theory, which also attribute a major role to experience.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) make clear that researchers, regard-\nless of theoretical orientation, need to get specific about how chil-\ndren\u2019s social experiences affect mental state understanding. Draw-\ning on an impressive array of studies showing that social experi-\nences and social factors play a role in this important area of psy-\nchological development, C&L argue that a new explanation of\ndevelopment is needed to account for these observations. Yet, few\nextant theories reject the descriptive claim that social experience\nand context matter. Theory-theory (Gopnik 1993; Gopnik & Well-\nman 1992; 1994; Wellman 1990), for example, contends that chil-\ndren\u2019s experience in the relevant domain (presumably including\npeople\u2019s psychological states and actions as revealed in social in-\nteractions) is the primary instigator of development, chiefly when\nchildren encounter phenomena that do not fit their current ex-\nplanatory framework and must reconstruct that framework. It may\nbe premature to reject current theories (and specifically theory-\ntheory) without examining closely the implications of existing the-\nories for the data.\nWe have previously noted that an understanding of some men-\ntal states seems directly dependent on observing what people say\nand do (Bartsch & Estes 1993). False belief, the \u201cneurotic\u201d focus\nof theory of mind (TOM) researchers, can be recognized in real\ntime only through such observation. I cannot recognize my own\ncurrent belief as false, but I can witness someone else proclaim a\nbelief I know to be false and then act on it. Perhaps one could\neventually comprehend the representational (and thus imperfect)\nnature of beliefs merely by reflecting on one\u2019s own past false be-\nliefs, but it seems likely that talking with others and watching their\ngoofy actions based on erroneous convictions contributes to this\nrecognition. Children\u2019s earliest talk about beliefs supports this\nsupposition. For example, Adam (age four years, two months) ex-\nplained that the dog barked on hearing footsteps because \u201cShe\nthought that was a tiger\u201d (Bartsch & Wellman 1995, p. 114). Ac-\ncording to theory-theory, experience drives conceptual develop-\nment; if experience concerning false belief occurs (in this impor-\ntant sense) only in social encounters, then it seems to us that\ntheory-theory necessarily accords an important role to such en-\ncounters. Perhaps theory-theorists have not yet offered suffi-\nciently extensive analyses of how experience (social or otherwise)\ntranslates into conceptual development, but that does not mean\nthat such experience is any less than the primary engine of devel-\nopment on this account (see Bartsch 2002, for further discussion\nof the role of experience in theory-theory).\nC&L argue that the nature, as well as the fact, of the effects of\nsocial factors on mental state understanding mandates a new ex-\nplanatory account. They point to murkiness across research results\nfrom studies employing different tasks and contexts: On some\ntasks, two-year-olds appear to engage in belief reasoning, whereas\non others, only much older children do. We have encountered\nsuch findings in our own research. To examine children\u2019s use of\nbelief understanding in persuasion, we administered hypothetical\nstory tasks requiring them to select an argument that would per-\nsuade a story character (e.g., a child\u2019s parent) to do something, such\nas permit a child to get a puppy (Bartsch & London 2000). Only\nchildren over seven consistently chose arguments relevant to the\ncharacter\u2019s belief, such as \u201cthe puppy is quiet\u201d in response to a par-\nent\u2019s stated belief that puppies are noisy. However, in comparable\ntasks involving interactive dialogue with puppets, even four-year-\nolds consistently chose belief-relevant arguments (Bartsch et al.\n2003). The interactive format not only increased children\u2019s atten-\ntion to belief information, it seemed to squeeze belief reasoning\neven out of children who did not pass a \u201cgold-standard\u201d false-\nbelief task. This is precisely the sort of finding that C&L regard as\nevidence that there is a gradual development of understanding\nthat is dependent on social factors and social contexts.\nOur interpretation is different. Despite the messiness of the\nempirical data, we think that it is true and useful to characterize\nthe older children in our studies as having a concept of belief and\nthe youngest children as not having the concept, consistent with a\ntheory-theory perspective. We agree with C&L that the variation\nobserved across methodologies deserves close examination. The\nfact that young children sometimes succeed on tasks and older\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 99\nchildren sometimes fail is important and might hold clues about\nhow development occurs. For instance, we suspect that the\nyoungest children\u2019s performance on our interactive persuasion\ntasks is indeed socially scaffolded through the child\u2019s engagement\nin dialogue. The social context of persuasion, in which two agents\nare initially at odds, together with the proclamation of a belief in\nback-and-forth dialogue (e.g., \u201cI think puppies are noisy!\u201d), may\nbe sufficient to allow the child to respond reflexively with the ar-\ngument that \u201cthis puppy is quiet.\u201d But our suspicion is that the\nchild responds to this situation without having much of a concept\nof belief, perhaps without any. However, such interchanges may\nprovide important experience to children so that they eventually\nnotice that responding to someone\u2019s stated belief with an argu-\nment relevant to that belief is more effective than when they re-\nspond with an irrelevant comment. This experience cannot be ex-\nplained without an understanding of beliefs and their sources, so\neventually the child adopts the more comprehensive theory. In\nthis sense, we certainly agree with C&L that close inspection of\nthe social facilitators of development is essential for explaining the\ndevelopment of mental state understanding. But social facilitation\neffects are not necessarily at odds with theory-theory.\nC&L complain that theory-theory and other existing theories\nfocus on cognitive architecture without reflecting on the social\nlandscape. But surely any adequate constructivist account must\naddress conceptual change in individuals and its implications for\ndevelopments in social understanding and reasoning, even when\nall the scaffolding provided by the social landscape has been ac-\nknowledged. Theory-theory offers exactly what C&L (target arti-\ncle, Abstract) say is needed, \u201ca theory of development . . . that ac-\ncords a fundamental role to social interaction, yet does not assume\nthat children simply adopt socially available knowledge but rather\nthat children construct an understanding of mind within social in-\nteraction.\u201d\nWhy believe in beliefs?\nMark H. Bickhard\nDepartment of Cognitive Science, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015.\nmark@bickhard.name http:\/\/www.bickhard.ws\/\nAbstract: A central pillar of Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) argument is\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work on language. I suggest that this support is not as\nstrong as might be wished, and offer an alternative approach to their con-\nclusion that language learning, especially of folk psychology, involves a so-\ncially embedded constructivism.\nTwo intertwined issues are the focus here: What is the status of\nbelief talk? And how do children learn this \u201cfolk psychology\u201d way\nof talking and functioning in the world? I would like to suggest\nsome problems with a core set of arguments in Carpendale &\nLewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) target article, and offer an alternative but conver-\ngent perspective on children\u2019s learning of folk psychology.\nC&L\u2019s discussion turns on Wittgenstein\u2019s later discussions and\narguments concerning language and language learning, and is\ntherefore only as strong as those discussions and arguments. But\nthere are reasons for concern here. First, Wittgenstein was ap-\npropriately concerned with the normativities of language, with the\n\u201cgrammar\u201d of language.1 However, his account of that normativ-\nity fails. His discussions in Philosophical Investigations (Wittgen-\nstein 1958) and previous works regarding ever more complex lan-\nguage games and the forms of life that these might participate in,\ndo not provide an account of normative emergence \u2013 complexity\nper se does not generate normativity \u2013 and leave readers with a\n\u201cbrute\u201d normativity (Bickhard 2003; Shankar 1996; Summerfield\n1996). This is not an adequate account of normativity, and that\ncasts doubt on other aspects of Wittgenstein\u2019s account of language.\nThe private language argument, in particular, turns precisely on\nnormativity as emerging only in the realm of the social. But this\nignores, for example, the normativities of individuals\u2019 epistemo-\nlogical and representational relations with the world, including the\nsocial world, and including, in particular, the language games in-\ndividuals are involved in. Wittgenstein slighted issues of episte-\nmology until his last work, On Certainty (1969), and even then ap-\nproached it solely from within a language framework. His failure\nto account for prelanguage normativities (and the normativities of\nprelinguistic animals, including human infants) constitutes a ma-\njor deficiency.\nAn additional problem with Wittgenstein\u2019s approach, at least as\ngenerally interpreted, lies in his account of the learning of words\nfor mental phenomena, such as belief. \u201cInner processes require\nouter criteria\u201d is an oft-repeated slogan. There is clearly a sense in\nwhich this is correct: Something in the social interaction must be\ninvolved in the learning of any word. But what is the (normative)\nepistemological relationship between the individual (toddler) and\nthose criteria? What is it that is being learned regarding, say, \u201cbe-\nlief\u201d? A standard interpretation is that a complex nonmonotonic\nlanguage game of criteria is being learned, one in which some cri-\nteria support the use of the term, while others, if present, may de-\nfeat that use, as when noticing that someone engaged in street the-\nater defeats the primary criteria that they seem to be in pain. As\nthis illustrates, however, that such learning must take place in\nterms of such criteria, slides into the assumption that what is\nlearned must be constituted out of such criteria (however complex\nthat constitution may be). This is not valid: If some internal con-\nstructive process is ongoing, and external (social) criteria serve as\nselections on that process, then what is learned \u2013 constructed \u2013\nneed not be constituted out of those criteria at all. That we must\nlearn from criteria, does not entail that criteria are what we must\nlearn.2 The knowledge of how to \u201cmake it\u201d as a frog is not consti-\ntuted out of the survivals, deaths, and reproductions that were se-\nlected among the evolutionary constructions involved.\n\u201cLearning language as learning names,\u201d which C&L (not to\nmention Wittgenstein) so rightly criticize, is in even worse condi-\ntion, however: There is nothing unitary, no coherent kind of mat-\nter of fact, for belief talk to refer to. The argument here is the (ex-\ntended) frame problem. I believe that large trucks can hurt me; I\nbelieve that trucks with stripes can hurt me; so can trucks with\npolka dots; and so on. There is an unbounded number of \u201cbeliefs\u201d\nthat I have, that anyone has, about trucks and their capacity to\nharm, as well as about almost everything else. Many of these be-\nliefs are ones that I may have never thought of before, and yet they\ndescribe accurately what I believe. But there are too many of them\nto \u201cfit\u201d into a bounded skull, and too many of them to be learned\nby a toddler in a bounded time span (Bickhard 2001). Whatever\nelse it does, belief talk cannot always or primarily refer to individ-\nuated beliefs. This I take to be convergent with C&L\u2019s arguments.\nNote that the point holds regardless of the role of external crite-\nria in the learning process.\nWhat is belief talk, then? The central suggestion is that folk psy-\nchology, belief talk especially, is involved in making, breaking, dis-\ncussing, evaluating, and so on, the epistemic claims and commit-\nments that people make with each other, including those that\nothers make with third parties, as well as those that each individ-\nual may be involved in directly (Bickhard 1998). Hence, if I claim,\nor if I behave in a way that presupposes, something to be true in\nthe world, then I have a commitment to answer challenges to that\npresuppositional belief, perhaps by supporting the belief involved,\nor by supporting my legitimacy in that belief even if it turns out to\nbe false, and so on. Most importantly, I do not have to have any\nexplicit representational belief that the world is not made of Brie\ncheese in order to presuppose it, and, hence, to \u201cbelieve\u201d it.\nTherefore, I do not have to have any individuated inner process\nnor any individuated criterial learning in order to have such a be-\nlief. This belief is not likely to encounter challenges, but my gen-\neral belief that \u201cfigures of authority are malevolent\u201d might, and yet\nit too need not involve individuated processes or learning. It too\ncan have the ontology solely of a presupposition of the way I live\nin the world.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n100 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nIn this view, belief talk and, by extension, folk psychology talk\nin general cannot be learned as a naming game or as a mere in-\nternalization of social practices. It must be constructively learned\nas a form of coordination of modes of commitment and modes of\nexplanation for the presuppositions of our interactions with each\nother and with the world.\nNOTES\n1. \u201cNormativity\u201d is used here in the philosophical sense of involving the\npossibility of being bad or wrong. It includes such oppositions as func-\ntional-dysfunctional, true-false, correct-incorrect, and so on. Regarding\nWittgenstein and language, see, for example, Glock (1996) and Shankar\n(1996).\n2. It is an empiricist assumption that it must be so constituted. In con-\ntrast, any action-based model of representation forces learning to be a con-\nstructivist process: The environment cannot impress successful action sys-\ntems into an otherwise passive mind (Bickhard & Campbell 1989).\nThe contributions of the interdisciplinary\nstudy of language to an understanding\nof mind\nNancy Budwig\nDepartment of Psychology, Clark University, Worcester, MA 01610.\nnbudwig@clarku.edu http:\/\/www.clarku.edu\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) emphasize the importance of view-\ning language as activity. In this commentary I push further their claim by\nhighlighting how constructions, rather than words, are the appropriate\nunit of analysis. In addition, I suggest how a discussion of indexicality paves\nthe way for a better understanding of how language provides a powerful\ntool for children\u2019s construction of mind.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) offer a provocative argument con-\ncerning children\u2019s construction of knowledge in and through so-\ncial interaction. Although I am in large agreement with the gen-\neral claims C&L make, I aim to clarify their argument concerning\nthe dynamic interplay between language and the development of\nan understanding of mind by touching on two inter-related issues:\nfirst, how functional linguistics can contribute to a better way to\nconceive of language, and second, how work from linguistic an-\nthropology can contribute to an account of how language plays a\nguiding role in children\u2019s construction of an understanding of\nmind.\nBeyond words: Constructions as the unit of linguistic analy-\nsis. One of the strengths of the target article concerns its emanci-\npated conception of language as activity. Rather than buying into\nthe tendency to view language solely in terms of its representa-\ntional function, C&L stress the centrality \u2013 borrowed from\nWittgenstein \u2013 of viewing language as action. Nevertheless, the\nauthors sometimes slip back into adopting jargon typically associ-\nated with the strictly representational view of language and could\nbe encouraged to move beyond the focus on \u201cwords\u201d by beginning\nto think of meaning in terms of the more dynamic notion of con-\nstructions (see Budwig 1998; Goldberg 1995; Tomasello 1998).\nConstructions are the typical unit of analysis for functional lin-\nguists, rather than the distinction between words and syntactic\nrules, because of their focus on patterns of usage. Simply put, con-\nstructions are best viewed as usage-based patterns and can be\nunits of meaning that involve, for instance, bound morphemes\n(e.g., past tense-ed), words (e.g., doggie), or more abstract con-\nstructions such as \u201cAnimate Actor Xed the Y.\u201d\nThe relevance of looking at constructions for understanding\nchildren\u2019s construction of mind can be illustrated by some cross-\nlinguistic work I have conducted examining children\u2019s early use of\ntransitive and intransitive utterances. For example, American two-\nyear-olds have been noted to reserve, early on, transitive con-\nstructions to scenes describing their own (and sometimes others\u2019)\nintentional actions that bring about change (e.g., My build a\ntower). These same children switch to intransitive constructions\nto describe a scene involving goal-blocking, as, for example, when\nthey intend to place a block on a tower they are building, but be-\ncause the block is too large, the structure tumbles (It doesn\u2019t\nbuild). Careful analyses of such constructions offer insight into\nchildren\u2019s construction of mind, although mental state vocabulary\nhas not been the focus of analysis (see Budwig 2002; Budwig et al.\n2001).\nThe idea emphasized by functional linguists who use construc-\ntions as the unit of analysis is that linguistic forms themselves do\nnot carry meaning in terms of re-presenting reality but rather,\nwhen fixed in particular scenes or symbolic fields, such forms gain\na more dynamic meaning and thereby play a central role in struc-\nturing experience. To this extent, constructions as embodied units\nof meaning that link sign and symbolic field play a central role in\nmediating the interpretation of reality.\nIndexicality and children\u2019s construction of mind. Although\nthere is growing agreement that social interaction is an arena\nwithin which the unfolding of an understanding of mind occurs,\nlittle is known about the particulars of this process. C&L begin to\nshed light on this issue by suggesting that relationships and talk it-\nself provide fundamental resources for children. Further insight\ninto how we might better understand the role of symbolic behav-\nior in constructing culturally appropriate ways of understanding\nmental life could stem from current work in linguistic anthropol-\nogy. Linguistic anthropologists start from the assumption that talk\nis a highly organized activity in which conversation unfolds in\nterms of highly structured units that universally segment the on-\ngoing stream of action into orderly sequences related to culturally\nsanctioned ways of organizing social life (see Budwig 2003;\nDuranti 1997). Central here is the discussion of indexicality. As\nOchs (1996) argues, linguistic constructions come to be habitually\nused in such ways that they come to index larger meaning units.\nThe indexical use of language constructions provides commu-\nnicative partners with signposts for how each partner grounds the\ninteraction and thereby allows for the dynamic unfolding of mean-\ning. Use of the particular construction comes to stand for a larger\nmeaning unit.\nConsider, for example, the use of desire talk in a crosslinguistic\nstudy of German and American caregiver-child dyads when the\nchildren were two years of age (see Moissinac & Budwig 2000).\nThe American caregivers were noted to use desire verbs in con-\nstructions either to inquire about their children\u2019s ongoing states\n(Do you want a tea cup?) or to access permission from their chil-\ndren to act in particular ways (Do you want me to pour tea?). In\ncontrast, the German caregivers rarely grounded desire talk in\nterms of individuals\u2019 desires and, rather, used desire talk to con-\nstruct joint activities and otherwise relate the children\u2019s actions to\nnormative frames. For instance, one mother appealed to joint de-\nsire as she realized it was time to clean up the blocks, saying to her\nchild: \u201cWollen wir die mal einsammeln (Do we want to collect\nthem)?\u201d The claim here is that the regular use of desire construc-\ntions, and more specifically, the way in which particular desire\nconstructions linked up in patterned ways with larger meaning\nunits, provides a powerful point of entry for children to tacitly be-\ngin to work on ways of seeing that are culturally sanctioned. It is\nimportant to note, consistent with the point made by C&L, that\nchildren do not accept ready-made the units as organized by care-\ngivers, but rather, that children\u2019s linguistic usage of desire con-\nstructions is indeed sensitive to the language patternings available\nin their caregivers\u2019 discourse. Rather than emphasizing that care-\ngivers or children talk about desire, the notion of indexicality con-\ntributes by providing a suggestion for how children can grab onto\nculturally relevant aspects of an understanding of mind by at-\ntending to the patterned uses of particular linguistic constructions\n(see Budwig 2003).\nAround the turn of the twentieth century, the study of human\ndevelopment often included close discussion between psycholo-\ngists, linguists, and anthropologists. C&L\u2019s article brings us back\nto such a time and encourages developmental psychologists to not\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 101\nbe limited by current blinders in how to conceive of the relation-\nship between language and thought.\nIn this commentary I have suggested two ways in which their\nargument can be strengthened, namely, by moving beyond an\nanalysis of words and by picking up on the notion of indexicality.\nGrounding discussion of children\u2019s construction of mind in the in-\nterdisciplinary study of language, thought, and culture will ulti-\nmately provide fruitful new avenues for future analyses.\nAgency mediation and an understanding \nof the mind\nOlga Chesnokova\nDepartment of Psychology, Moscow State University, Moscow 103 009,\nRussia. olches@olches.ps.msu.su\nAbstract: This commentary is an attempt to give a Vygotskian perspective\non Carpendale\u2019s & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) target article. The article uses ideas that\nare well familiar to Vygotsky\u2019s scholars. However, it develops these ideas\nfurther and raises important empirical questions about the role of social\ninteraction in the development of social cognition. The article provides \na fresh view on the old problems and frames themes traditional for the\nEnglish-speaking developmental psychology into a broader international\nperspective.\nParadoxically, Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) article is probably\nthe first serious attempt to frame the discussion on the develop-\nment of social understanding in a social context. The main point\nof C&L is close to the one targeted by Lev Vygotsky, who raises\nthe question of whether children create their theories of the so-\ncial world on the basis of their innate modules and independent\nlife experiences or they create those theories within a social inter-\naction (1999). Having reviewed a vast number of sources, the au-\nthors come to the conclusion that social understanding is \u201cthe\nemergent product of social interaction\u201d (Gibbs 2001). Within a\nVygotskian social-constructivist perspective, the idea seems quite\nmundane. However, though implanted in the context of ongoing\ndiscussions about innate \u201cmodules,\u201d \u201cimplicit knowledge,\u201d and in-\nherent understanding of \u201caffordances\u201d \u2013 concepts that have long\ndominated developmental psychology in English-speaking na-\ntions \u2013 the ideas proposed in the target article are actually fresher\nthan they might seem at first glance.\nHaving discussed the ample empirical evidence demonstrating\nthat a higher level of social understanding is more evident in chil-\ndren who have closer positive relationships with significant others\nthan in those who have less close relationships, C&L use this evi-\ndence to outline directions for future research that could bring\nthis relatively stale area of studies out of the deadlock of the \u201cthe-\nories of mind.\u201d One of these directions might be studying multi-\nple nonverbal interactions that occur in the natural social setting\nand play a major role in promoting social understanding, espe-\ncially at the early, prelanguage stages of development. The central\nclaim of C&L is that the focus of research should be shifted from\ninvestigating mental states and mentalist concepts as the out-\ncomes of children\u2019s understanding of others\u2019 minds to the careful\nanalysis of social interactions and cultural contexts that shape the\ncontent of children\u2019s social knowledge. In fact, the authors resur-\nrect the old but fundamental question of how social interaction\nshould be understood. Is social interaction \u201cbased on the interac-\ntion of minds which can be properly understood only when one\ntakes into account what people think about other people\u2019s\nthoughts\u201d (Perner & Wimmer 1985, p. 438), or is the mind itself\n\u201c the product of social life and . . . activity which was earlier shared\nby two people\u201d (Luria 1969, p. 143)? I am sympathetic with the\nauthors\u2019 adoption of Chapman\u2019s (and Luria\u2019s) view on this point:\nthat social interaction is at the base of mental and social under-\nstanding.\nBut do social interactions directly shape children\u2019s growing un-\nderstanding of mental states? Or is there a mechanism that medi-\nates the link between social interactions and children\u2019s social un-\nderstanding? Closely following Wittgenstein\u2019s view of the \u201csocially\nprojected\u201d nature of mental activity, the authors at the same time\nstrongly emphasize that a child is an active agent within social in-\nteraction, and not a passive recipient of socially induced knowl-\nedge. In this, C&L closely approach the \u201cactivity principle\u201d in the\nunderstanding of cognitive development that has long been em-\nployed by the Vygotskian tradition (see El\u2019konin 1969). The \u201cac-\ntivity principle\u201d suggests that the simple fact of a child\u2019s involve-\nment in social interaction is a necessary but not a sufficient\ncondition of the child\u2019s improvement of his or her social under-\nstanding (as well as his or her understanding of other people\u2019s\nmental states). It is important to analyze what position (active or\npassive) the child, as an agent, takes in this social interaction.\nOne striking example of the role of agency in social interaction\ncan be found in studies on children\u2019s moral understanding. In one\nof these studies, preschool children who had previously trans-\ngressed on moral tasks (such as deliberate cheating) were asked to\ninstruct other transgressors to observe the same moral rules (Sub-\nbotsky 1993). Although in the post-tests all the \u201cinstructors\u201d re-\nvealed an equal degree of understanding of what was right or\nwrong to do in social interactions with a \u201cmoral underpinning,\u201d\nonly those children who had actively accepted the position of a\nmoral instructor did not repeatedly transgress if given a chance to\ndo so. This example empirically illustrates a circularity puzzle (a\ncircle) that is inherent in the claim that children are agents within\na social interaction: that is, whereas interactions can facilitate chil-\ndren\u2019s understanding of other people\u2019s (and their own) mental\nstates, it is the child him- or herself who ascribes value to the ac-\nquired knowledge. On this ground, the claim promoted by C&L,\nthat children\u2019s social understanding is shaped while they interact\nwith others, should be supplemented by the principle of \u201cagency\nmediation.\u201d This means that social interaction can elicit a proper\n(and not only formal or verbal) social understanding in a child only\nwhen the child takes an active position within the interaction and\nimplants the acquired social knowledge with personal (and emo-\ntional) meaning. In fact, this provides an answer to the question\nformulated by Astington and Olson (1995): Does a child passively\nadopt mentalist concepts available from cultural social surround-\nings, or does the child actively construct these concepts within the\ninteractions?\nThe principle of \u201cagency mediation\u201d also gives us a chance to\nintegrate a vast body of fascinating studies of the social context of\nproblem-solving interactions and \u201ctheory of mind\u201d into the stud-\nies on social intelligence and personality (Cantor & Kihlstrom\n1989; Dunbar 1996; Garton 2004; Gauvain 2001). The context of\nan individual\u2019s social life shapes his or her understanding of men-\ntalist states (such as beliefs, desires, intentions, attitudes) only\nwhen this context is filtered through the individual\u2019s integrated\n\u201cself\u201d (personal identity). The \u201cself\u201d (agent) exercises control over\nthe person\u2019s immediate actions and also sets up the individual\u2019s ul-\ntimate life goals. In light of the \u201cagency mediation\u201d principle, we\ncan now reformulate the final \u201cdevelopmental goal\u201d of social cog-\nnition and social understanding: to achieve an understanding of\nother people\u2019s minds for the purpose of using this knowledge for\nbuilding stable and happy personal (moral, social, business, and\nother) relationships.\nTo conclude, C&L\u2019s paper utilizes ideas that have been around\nfor a considerable period of time. Nevertheless, the paper does\nraise interesting and intellectually challenging theoretical and em-\npirical questions about the role of social interaction for the devel-\nopment of social cognition. It stimulates a refreshing way of think-\ning and gives a good stir to the problem that has been boiling for\na long time within the encapsulated circle of English-speaking de-\nvelopmental psychology.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n102 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nI ain\u2019t got no body: Developmental\npsychology must be embodied and enactive,\nas well as \u201csocial\u201d\nA.

First, \u201cmind talk\u201d is not, in fact, any different from the other aspects\nof the social world about which children learn. Second, there is no choice\nbetween either the \u201csingle mind\u201d or the \u201csocial context.\u201d Finally, there is\na spurious separation between organism and environment.\nIn this target article, the authors take issue with the reigning \u201cin-\ndividualistic\u201d approach in theories of children\u2019s development of\nsocial understanding. In what follows, we want to support their\ncriticism of this approach, but in somewhat different terms. We\ntherefore raise three questions for the authors to consider.\n1. What if we were \u201cAntipodeans\u201d? Richard Rorty\u2019s (1980) in-\nteresting thought experiment regarding persons without minds,\nthe Antipodeans, has something to teach us as far as \u201cconstructing\nan understanding of mind\u201d goes. Among these people, according\nto Rorty, \u201cneurology and biochemistry had been the first disci-\nplines in which technological breakthroughs had been achieved,\nand a large part of the conversation of these people concerned the\nstate of their nerves.\u201d Also, given the state of their knowledge of\nphysiology, \u201ceach well-formed sentence in the language which\nanybody bothered to form could easily be correlated with a read-\nily identifiable neural state\u201d (p. 71). Using this device, Rorty\nwanted to show that nothing \u201changs on the distinction between\nmind and body,\u201d that the \u201cmind\u201d is not something about which we\nhave to have knowledge, and that \u201cNo predictive or explanatory or\ndescriptive power would be lost if we had spoken Antipodean all\nour lives\u201d (p. 120). We introduce Rorty\u2019s story here to undermine\nany attachment to learning mind-talk as special, as somehow re-\nquiring answers different in kind (i.e., more focused on the inner\nexperiences or the \u201cfree mind\u201d of the developing organism) from\nthose answers dealing with the norms, habits, rituals, beliefs, and\npractices of the social group to which the child belongs. In these\nterms, therefore, we want to rule out \u201ctheories of mind\u201d on two\ncounts: (1) as theories of anything, and (2) as theories (for the lat-\nter, cf. Millikan 1995, pp. 51\u201382).\nIn addition, we want to cast aside \u201csimulation theory\u201d and espe-\ncially its focus on \u201cintrospection,\u201d and propose that children are\nmost likely to be genetically endowed with strong pattern recogni-\ntion abilities and the tendency to establish correlations between, in\n\u201cour\u201d case, mind talk and various associated behaviours, first in oth-\ners and later in themselves, after the onset of language. This fol-\nlows from Millikan\u2019s (1995) views that folk psychology merely de-\nscribes \u201cthe competence\u201d of \u201ccertain devices inside us\u201d and that it\nis properly the job of the neuroscientist to look for the devices that\nshow particular kinds of competence. Concerning ourselves thus\nwith \u201ccertain devices inside us\u201d places our position alongside those\nfavouring attention to our genetic endowments regarding learning.\n2. Does gradual learning necessarily imply constructivism?\nThe fact that learning is gradual does not seem to favour one or\nanother theory on the relationship between \u201cthe social\u201d and the\ntools or resources with which the child becomes proficient. That\nis, the connective changes made during learning and the synaptic\nadjustments the brain undergoes (as change is steered by both\none\u2019s genetic heritage and culturally specific, unique experiences),\nall take time (cf. Churchland 1996). Phrased differently, gradual\nchange alone does not privilege a more social or constructive fo-\ncus on things.\nIn order to support their view, the authors must do more than\nprovide evidence to show that social history shapes individual dif-\nferences in time and space. In other words, what remains empir-\nically open has to do with the mechanisms of transmission be-\ntween social history and individual knowledge acquisition \u2013\nspecifically, how this transmission occurs from case to case or task\nto task (through internalisation, in Vygotsky\u2019s terms, or gradual\nconstruction, in the terms of the authors, or the twin mechanisms\nof assimilation and accommodation, in Piaget\u2019s model of knowl-\nedge development).\nThe only thing that seems certain is that one\u2019s knowledge of the\nworld, or \u201cthat small part of it that is relevant to one\u2019s own practi-\ncal concerns . . . is embodied in the peculiar configuration of one\u2019s\n1014 individual synaptic connections . . . which are set to pro-\ngressively more useful values during learning and development\u201d\n(Churchland 1996, p. 5), and that these configurations are the re-\nsult of a \u201cmerging\u201d of organism and environment (in Millikan\u2019s\n[1995] terms); there is therefore no choice between \u201cthe single\nmind\u201d and the \u201csocial context,\u201d contrary to Raver and Leadbeater\u2019s\n(1993) assertion; it is a bewitchment precisely of the kind that Wit-\ntengenstein warned against.\n3. Is there any such thing as a \u201csingle mind\u201d? To expand on\nthis point, it seems to us that, once we move away from such mis-\nleading distinctions, labels (\u201ctheory-of-mind\u201d), and other be-\nwitchments and from our tendency to utter inarticulate sounds\n(another Wittgensteinian jab at bad thinking), we are probably in\na better position to come up with answers to why-questions; for\nexample, why \u201caspects of social interaction are correlated with so-\ncial understanding.\u201d As Millikan (1995) states: \u201cThere is no clear\nline but only the most arbitrary demarcation between the organ-\nism considered as process and its environment. The organismic\nprocess has no skin.\u201d (pp. 179\u201380). Hence merely adding \u2013 in\nsome or other old or new configuration \u2013 \u201cthe social,\u201d as the au-\nthors suggest, does not clarify the relationships between learning\nand maturity\/development, nor its other or related side, organism\nand environment.\nWhat has to be worked out are the modes of connection be-\ntween these processes and factors, and these probably differ from\ncase to case. That is, we suspect that the gap between, for exam-\nple, \u201cinitial knowledge\u201d in the domains of \u201cphysics, psychology,\nnumber, and geometry\u201d (cf. Spelke 1994, p. 433) and \u201cour mature\nknowledge,\u201d which, as Spelke tell us, \u201cdoes not appear to be\nshared by infants\u201d (p. 435), will be filled in through the bits and\npieces of time- and place-appropriate features which are medi-\nated to the developing organism by its caregiver(s) (cf. Feuer-\nstein\u2019s description of \u201cmediated learning experience\u201d [Feuerstein\n1980, p. 15], which is a clinical elaboration of Vygotsky\u2019s Zone of\nProximal Development [Vygotsky 1978, p. 86]). It is these changes\nover time, whereby \u201cinitial\u201d infant knowledge is displaced, re-\nvised, and overturned on its route to becoming adult knowledge,\nthat seem to us to offer empirical possibilities for examining the\ninteraction between development and learning and organisms and\nenvironment. That a refocus on embedded cognition occasions\nmethodological adjustments is also recognised (cf. Craig 2003).\nThus, once we slough off any lingering attachment to an isolated\n\u201cmind,\u201d our theories of learning will automatically bring brain into\nworld (and vice versa) and will consider cognition in context (Clark\n1999; Hutchins 1995; Rowlands 1999).\nChildren, chimpanzees, and social\nunderstanding: Inter- or intra-specific?\nTimothy J.

This commentary describes how Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s\n(C&L\u2019s) argument could be made more persuasive with a more rigorous in-\nterpretation of the studies of chimpanzees\u2019 understanding of mind.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 103\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) provide a long-overdue treatment of\nthe development of social understanding as influenced by social\ninteractions. As such, their target article goes a long way in rec-\nonciling the ideas of Wittgenstein, Piaget, and Vygotsky. When re-\nmoved from evolutionary considerations, C&L\u2019s arguments might\nlose considerable appeal. In an effort to place their work in a larger\nevolutionary context, and in the context of what the authors call\nthe \u201clean interpretation\u201d of joint attention, they cite some work\nsuggesting that chimpanzees \u201cdo not appear to understand the\npsychological significance of gaze direction\u201d (sect. 3.1, para. 8).\nCuriously, considering the authors\u2019 thesis that social interaction\nplays a major role in constructing understandings of mind, they\nfail to discuss the social matrix of the chimpanzees so referenced.\nPovinelli and Eddy (1996) carried out a series of studies that ap-\npear very similar to the ones that C&L cite from Povinelli (1999).\nThat is, the 1996 work included findings that, to quote C&L (sect.\n3.1, para. 8),\nchimpanzees trained to beg with a hand-out gesture and given the op-\nportunity to beg for food from one of two experimenters sitting side-by-\nside are initially just as likely to beg from someone with her eyes closed,\nwith her head turned away, or even with her head covered by a bucket\nas they are to beg from someone with her eyes open.\nThese are some of the exact findings of Povinelli and Eddy (1996).\nUnfortunately, I have been unable to obtain reprints of the\nPovinelli (1999) report from his lab, so it is unclear whether he has\nreplicated nearly our entire series of experiments (14 studies with\nchimpanzees and one with young children) or whether C&L are\nactually referring to Povinelli and Eddy (1996). Regardless of the\nanswer to that question, the 1996 report brings to the fore an ad-\nditional interpretation of the chimpanzee findings distinct from\nC&L\u2019s \u201clean interpretation,\u201d which has a direct bearing on one of\nthe central ideas they raise.\nSpecifically, in the 1996 work, one of the interpretations of the\nchimpanzees\u2019 failure to take into the account the visual perception\nof others concerned the interspecific nature of the tasks. That is,\nthe chimpanzees in those studies were required to reason about\nthe visual perception of members of a different species (human\nexperimenters). According to this interpretation, the chimpanzees\nin these studies might in fact show very different results if re-\nquired to reason about the visual perception of other chimpanzees\n(rather than humans).\nBecause these studies have not actually been carried out, it is\nunclear whether the failure of the chimpanzees under these cir-\ncumstances is because they lack the capacity to make attributions\nof visual perception to others (C&L\u2019s \u201clean interpretation\u201d) or be-\ncause they have simply been asked to make attributions to mem-\nber(s) of the wrong species. Given the human tendency to at-\ntribute mental states to some (but not all) animals (see Eddy et al.\n1993), this becomes a distinct possibility when applied to chim-\npanzees.\nWhere would an acceptance of the \u201cchimpanzees\u2019 failure due\nto the interspecific nature of the tasks\u201d interpretation leave C&L\u2019s\nideas concerning the development of children\u2019s social under-\nstanding? Probably not in a fundamentally different place from\nwhere it is now. Having said that, if explicit linkages between the\ndevelopment of differing (or similar) abilities in members of dif-\nferent species can be made with data that have singular (rather\nthan multiple) interpretations, then such ideas could be placed\nsquarely and firmly in our growing understanding of the relation\nbetween psychological phenomenon and evolutionary facts.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank David Gow for his information, support, encouragement, good hu-\nmor, and worthiness as a colleague; and thanks to Alessandra Bianchi for\nproofreading at the eleventh hour.\nMore than a context for learning? The\nepistemic triangle and the dialogic mind\nCharles Fernyhough\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Durham, Science Laboratories,\nDurham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom. c.p.fernyhough@durham.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/c.p.fernyhough\nAbstract: Theory-of-mind (TOM) competence is under-specified in\nCarpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) account. In the neo-Vygotskian alternative\noutlined below, TOM development is driven by the internalisation of dia-\nlogic exchanges which preserve the triadic intentional relations of interac-\ntions within the epistemic triangle. On this view, TOM competence stems\nfrom children\u2019s ability to operate flexibly with the multiple perspectives\nmanifested in internalised dialogue.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) pull together an impressive range of\nfindings on social-environmental influences on theory-of-mind\n(TOM) development, and set out a welcome new theoretical\nframework for understanding how such capacities might emerge\nwithin interpersonal interaction. Where their article is less satis-\nfying is in specifying those cognitive mechanisms that might result\nfrom such developmental processes. That is, the authors give an\ninteresting and plausible account of how TOM competence de-\nvelops, but they never really say what it is. In particular, the au-\nthors are unclear about whether the epistemic triangle serves pri-\nmarily as a context for learning the criteria for the correct\napplication of mental state terms, or whether it goes on to play a\nrole in children\u2019s subsequent solo reasoning about the mind. The\nauthors hint that they have the latter in mind when they note that\nchildren\u2019s facility with mental state language, developing hand-in-\nhand with their understanding of the social contexts within which\nsuch language use is appropriate, allows them to become \u201cable to\nthink about situations abstracted from their practical context of in-\nteraction and . . . to anticipate and reason about situations such as\nthe false belief task\u201d (target article, sect. 4.1, para. 9). At the same\ntime, this account leaves it unclear whether the end product of de-\nvelopment, namely TOM competence, amounts to much more\nthan the correct application of mental state terms and concepts in\naccordance with externally derived criteria for their use. In this\ncase, an unsatisfactorily individualistic account of TOM compe-\ntence appears to have slipped in through the back door, and one\nis left wondering what the C&L account can offer that the con-\nventional theory-theory cannot.\nIt is here that the authors could have gone further with their in-\nterest in the work of Vygotsky. Although Vygotsky did not directly\naddress the problem of TOM development as it has been charac-\nterised by researchers in this area, several aspects of his writings\nare potentially relevant here. First, Vygotskian ideas can be useful\nin an enculturation account of the sort that C&L discuss in section\n2.1. Second, the idea of na\u00efve participation, which sees infants be-\ning drawn into practices that they will only later come to under-\nstand (Vygotsky 1934\/1987, Ch. 4), is central to C&L\u2019s conception\nof how an \u201cinitial, fragile social understanding\u201d (sect. 4.1, para. 9)\ncan become transformed into a fully fledged TOM. Third, Vygot-\nsky\u2019s concept of the zone of proximal development (Vygotsky 1934\/\n1987, Ch. 6) provides a framework for understanding how sensi-\ntive input from caregivers can \u201cscaffold\u201d children\u2019s acquisition of\nmental state terms and concepts (Meins et al. 2002). Fourth, Vy-\ngotsky\u2019s idea that language can be used as a psychological tool (Vy-\ngotsky 1930\/1978) in augmenting pre-existing cognitive capacities\nsuggests that private and inner speech may play important roles in\nmediating children\u2019s own reflections on the nature of mental states\nand processes (Meins et al. 2003). Finally, the Vygotskian notion\nof internalisation of semiotically mediated interpersonal activity\n(Vygotsky 1931\/1997) may prove useful for our theorising about\nhow children\u2019s developing TOM abilities are rooted in their expe-\nrience of social exchanges.\nI suggest that it is this latter aspect of Vygotsky\u2019s theory that can\nmake the difference between an essentially individualistic account\nof TOM development based primarily on the learning of terms for\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n104 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nmental state concepts, and an account that sees social under-\nstanding as genuinely and profoundly rooted in social experience.\nIn a now-familiar set of arguments, Vygotsky proposed that higher\nmental functions such as mediated memory and self-regulatory in-\nner speech are formed through the progressive internalisation and\ntransformation of semiotically mediated interpersonal exchanges\n(Vygotsky 1934\/1987, Ch. 4). In internalising dialogue with oth-\ners, the child internally reconstructs the dynamics of that dialogue\nwith, crucially, all of its triadic intentional relations intact. The es-\nsential thing about dialogue, for our purposes, is that it involves a\nsimultaneous unity of different perspectives (Holquist 1990) on\nthe element of reality to which the dialogue is intentionally re-\nlated. The internalisation of dialogue, for which normal children\nare pre-linguistically prepared by the socio-affective responsivities\nand joint attentional capacities described in section 3.1, therefore\ninvolves children taking on a semiotic (usually natural-language)\nrepresentation of the alternative perspective manifested in that di-\nalogue (Fernyhough 1996; 1997).\nIt is this permeation of children\u2019s thinking by the different per-\nspectives encountered within the epistemic triangle that forms the\nbasis of their developing ability to operate with these perspectives,\nfirst in naturalistic social-cognitive reasoning contexts, and later in\nmore formalised tests of TOM. The end result of internalisation is\nthus an ongoing interplay between different, simultaneously held\nperspectives on reality, represented first in private speech and ul-\ntimately in dialogic inner speech. To the extent that it requires the\nflexible and simultaneous co-ordination of multiple perspectives\non an aspect of a task situation \u2013 such as the location of an unex-\npectedly transferred object or the phenomenal qualities of an item\nin the appearance-reality task (Fernyhough 1996) \u2013 TOM rea-\nsoning represents the pre-eminent example of dialogic thinking.\nAllowing the epistemic triangle to become internalised would\ntherefore provide C&L with a specific cognitive mechanism\nthrough which children could operate with the mental states of\nothers and \u201ccoordinat[e] these often differing perspectives with\ntheir own beliefs\u201d (sect. 4.2, para. 1). It would also provide a\nframework for making sense of the social-influences findings that\nwent beyond the (admittedly important) issue of learning the cor-\nrect use of mental state terms. For example, by focusing on how\ncaregivers differ in their ability to construct dialogues with their\nchildren in which the intentional stance is taken (Garfield et al.\n2001), the neo-Vygotskian approach is better placed to account for\nthe evidence that very early differences in maternal mind-mind-\nedness relate to individual differences in TOM several years later\n(Meins et al. 2002; 2003). Much more than a mere context for\nlearning, the internalised epistemic triangle becomes an essential\npart of the child\u2019s solution to the moment-by-moment challenge\nof engaging with other minds.\nThe roots of social understanding in the\nattachment relationship: An elaboration \non the constructionist theory\nPeter Fonagy\nSub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology, University College London,\nLondon WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom. p.fonagy@ucl.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.psychol.ucl.ac.uk\/psychoanalysis\/peter.htm\nAbstract: It is argued that constructionist theory provides only a partial\naccount of how secure attachment leads to better social understanding. In\naddition to cooperative parent-child relations, the more efficient arousal\nand affect regulation system of secure infants, and developmental moder-\nators of the processes of imitation, may play a part in explaining the asso-\nciation and offer clues as to how effective social understanding is gener-\nally acquired.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) make a strong case that past attempts\nat accounting for the influence of social interaction on the devel-\nopment of children\u2019s social understanding1 within the confines of\nthe three prominent models of theory of mind acquisition have\nbeen at best partial. They reject both the enculturation and the ex-\ntant developmental propositions (maturation, theory-theory, and\nsimulation) in favour of a model that assumes that social under-\nstanding is an emergent property of the child\u2019s experience of cer-\ntain regularities in interaction with others. The \u201cepistemic trian-\ngle\u201d (i.e., referential interactions between infant and caregiver\nabout the object) is assumed inevitably to generate the discovery\nthat others sometimes have different beliefs about the world from\none\u2019s own. If we, taking the point of view of the infant, assume the\nexistence of a stable external world, the actions of others in com-\nmunicative interactions can only be understood given the suppo-\nsition that they have different beliefs about aspects of the world.\nChildren achieve comparable levels of development at similar\nages simply because of the commonalities of their experience. The\ncorollary of this is that differences in the acquisition of social un-\nderstanding are to be understood in terms of crucial differences\nin their experience of triadic interactions. For example, our results\nfrom the London Parent-Child Project (Fonagy et al. 1997) that\nchildren securely attached at one year were significantly more\nlikely to pass the Belief-Desire reasoning test at five and a half\nyears (n 5 90, p , .005, OR 5 3.8, CI: 1.5\u20139.9) may be under-\nstood in terms of attachment being a good marker for a coopera-\ntive parent-child relationship, which, according to constructivist\ntheory, is the ideal context for the development of knowledge.\nAlthough I do not fundamentally disagree with either the spirit\nor the details of the case advanced in the target article, there are\nimportant gaps in the model advanced by the authors. The target\narticle is helpful in drawing attention to the common ground be-\ntween Bowlby\u2019s (1980) and Piaget\u2019s (1945\/1962) thinking, partic-\nularly in relation to Piaget\u2019s notion of schemes and Bowlby\u2019s as-\nsumptions concerning internal working models. However, how do\nsecure-autonomous internal working models in the parent lead to\nthe kinds of cooperative relationships \u201cthat might permit unre-\nstrained communication, that allows participants to understand\neach other fully\u201d (Habermas 1983\/1990)? We have to assume a di-\nalectic model of self-development (Hegel 1807) where the child\u2019s\ncapacity to create a coherent image of mind is critically dependent\non an experience of being clearly perceived as a mind by the at-\ntachment figure. The now overwhelming evidence for the trans-\ngenerational transmission of attachment security is consistent with\nthis (van IJzendoorn 1995), and this may link to the emergence of\nmentalisation in the child (for a review, see Fonagy et al. 2002).\nAccumulating transgenerational evidence suggests that mothers\nwho conceive of their own childhoods largely in mental state terms\nare more likely to go on to develop secure attachments with their\nchildren (Fonagy et al. 1991; Target et al., in press) and to have a\nmore differentiated mentalised picture of their infant (Muzik &\nRosenblum 2003; Slade et al. 2001), which in turn is associated\nwith more mind-minded comments (Muzik & Rosenblum 2003)\nand infant security (Slade et al. 2001). As the work of Elizabeth\nMeins and colleagues (2001) suggests, mothers whose state of\nmind with respect to attachment may be described as secure\n(Main 2000) expose the infant to more mental state language,\nwhich in turn advances the child\u2019s social understanding.\nYet, more than mental state language, the coherence with which\nthe child\u2019s mental state is perceived may be the critical variable.\nIn a study by David Oppenheim (Koren-Karie et al. 2002; Op-\npenheim & Koren-Karie 2002), mothers were asked to narrate a\nvideotaped playful interaction that they had just had with their in-\nfant. Mothers who were reflective in their narratives, able to see\nvarious experiences through the child\u2019s eyes and gain new insights\nas they talked, were far more likely to have securely attached in-\nfants than mothers who either had preset conceptions of the child\nwhich they appeared to impose, or disengaged from trying to un-\nderstand what was on the child\u2019s mind. Most pertinent was the ob-\nservation that disorganised attachment classification was associ-\nated with mothers who were incoherent, switching between the\nabove categories and not fitting well into any of them. Thus,\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 105\n\u201cmind-mindedness\u201d and security of attachment in the caregiver\nappear to go together and are associated with a coherent working\nmodel of the child that is richly imbued with representations of in-\nternal states. This is the substance of the collaboration and coop-\nerativeness at the heart of constructionist theory.\nCooperative relationship rooted in the coherence of the per-\nception of the child\u2019s mental state may not be the only factor. The\ndevelopment of the key psychological capacities that underpin\ntheory of mind may be grounded in the attachment relationship\n(Fonagy & Target 2002; Fonagy et al. 2002). It is quite probable\nthat an important mediator of the association of secure attachment\nand theory-of-mind development lies in the regulation of physio-\nlogical arousal. Secure attachment may be conducive to mentalis-\ning because it facilitates an optimal level of arousal (Field 1985;\nKraemer 1999; Panksepp et al. 1999). Mentalising depends sub-\nstantially on optimal prefrontal cortex functioning (Adolphs 2003;\nBlair & Cipolotti 2000; Rowe et al. 2001; Siegal & Varley 2002;\nStuss et al. 2001). Medial and orbital prefrontal cortices have been\nlinked to the regulation of interpersonal relationships, social co-\noperativity, moral behaviour, and social aggression (Damasio\n2003; Davidson et al. 2000; Greene & Haidt 2002; Kelley et al.\n2002; Schore 2003). The optimal functioning of the prefrontal cor-\ntex in turn depends on optimal arousal. Neurochemical regulation\nof the prefrontal cortex is complementary to that of posterior cor-\ntex and subcortical structures2 (Arnsten 1998; Arnsten et al. 1999).\nArnsten and Mayes (Arnsten 1998; Arnsten et al. 1999; Mayes\n2000) have argued that when arousal exceeds a certain threshold,\nit is as if a neurochemical switch is thrown. This switch shifts us\nout of the executive mode of flexible reflective responding into the\nfight-or-flight mode of action-centred responding. Those with in-\nsecure or disorganised attachment relationships are sensitised to\nintimate interpersonal encounters and experience higher arousal,\nand the relative level of arousal in the frontal or posterior part of\nthe cortex readily shifts posteriorly.\nSimilar arguments could be mounted in relation to effortful\ncontrol. The capacity to inhibit a dominant response in place of a\nsubdominant one is a key achievement of early development\n(Kochanska et al. 2000; Rothbart et al. 2000). It also appears to be\npowerfully predicted by security of attachment at one year\n(Kochanska 2001; Kochanska et al. 2000; Kreppner et al. 2001).\nMentalising involves setting aside immediate physical reality in\nfavour of a less compelling reality of the other\u2019s internal state. Pre-\nvious studies have linked the acquisition of effortful control to per-\nformance on the false belief tasks as they follow a common devel-\nopmental timetable and share a common brain region and yield\ncommon types of pathology (Carlson & Moses 2001). Hence, we\nwould argue that children with a background of secure attachment\nare more rapid in their acquisition of mentalisation in the context\nof social relationships because secure attachment has equipped\nthem with the capacity appropriately to attend selectively to crit-\nical aspects of such interactions.\nMore recently one of the most creative writers in this field,\nGeorge Gergely (2003), has identified two strategies of imitation\nin 14- to 18-month-old infants; 14-month-olds use an observa-\ntional learning strategy based on an active process of evaluation of\nsituational constraints using the principle of rational action\n(Gergely & Csibra 1997; 2003), imitating only when the other\u2019s ac-\ntion is not explained by situational constraints and therefore points\nto the affordance property of the object (Gergely et al. 2002). (In\na modified replication of Meltzoff \u2019s famous study of the infant im-\nitating the experimenter switching a light on in a box by touching\nit with his head, Gergely et al. [2002] showed that imitation does\nnot occur when the hands of the actor are visibly constrained, and\nwhen the infant interprets the use of the head as a rational action\njustified by the actor\u2019s immobilisation and not relevant to the in-\nfant because the infant\u2019s hands are free.) Four months later, the\nphysical constraints appear irrelevant (Gergely 2003), as the infant\nimitates regardless of the observed physical constraints; it is as-\nsumed that this is because the infant presumes a cooperative in-\ntention to teach on the part of the actor. Thus, by 18 months the\ninfant presumes that the actor as a rational mental agent has al-\nready tested the rationality of the novel action him- or herself.\nGergely\u2019s work has an important qualification for constructivist\ntheory insofar as that the gradual emergence of mentalisation ap-\npears to change the experience of the \u201cepistemic triangle\u201d for the\ninfant. The experience of interchange evolves from a teleological\nexperience at 14 months to the beginning of a mentalistic one by\n18 months.3 Gergely (2003) argues that one of the central envi-\nronmental factors that contributes to the shift from teleological\nemulation to the assumption of a cooperative intention to teach,\nis previous experience of \u201cbenevolent teaching\u201d interactions initi-\nated by the caregiver. It is likely that in dysfunctional attachment\ncontexts, the infant learns to interpret parental initiation of eye\ncontact and other communicative attention-directing behaviours\nas cues signalling that potentially harmful interactions are likely to\nfollow. The infant may develop the defensive coping strategy of \ninhibiting the mentalistic interpretation of such communicative\nbehavioural cues. Hence, in severely dysfunctional attachment\ncontexts, infants are likely to fail to interpret mentalistically the\ncommunicative referential cues of the demonstrator as indicating\na benevolent and cooperative intention to teach.\nIn brief, while broadly accepting the constructivist model, we\nsuggest (1) that specific capacities (arousal regulation, effortful\ncontrol) link the secure base that generates secure attachment\nwith evolving symbolic function; (2) that the link of the secure\nbase phenomenon to the development of mentalisation will be in-\ncreasingly understood to be causal rather than correlational, in\nthat the group of capacities that underpin adequate social under-\nstanding (what Bogdan [1997] called interpretation) are evolu-\ntionarily tied to it; in other words, that the evolutionary function\nof the attachment relationship in humans goes beyond the pro-\ntection of the vulnerable infant to providing an environment\nwithin which social understanding may be acquired; and there-\nfore, finally (3) that deficits in attachment create a vulnerability in\nthe child to later environmental challenges.\nNOTES\n1. Our preferred term for social understanding has been \u201cmentalisa-\ntion\u201d (see Morton 1989).\n2. As the level of cortical activation increases through mutually inter-\nactive norepinephrine alpha 2 and dopamine D1 systems, prefrontal cor-\ntical function improves on capacities such as anticipation (shifting of at-\ntention), planning\/organisation, and working memory. With excessive\nstimulation, norepinephrine alpha 1 and dopamine D1 inhibitory activity\nincreases; the prefrontal cortex goes \u201coff-line,\u201d and posterior cortical and\nsubcortical functions (e.g., more automatic functions) take over. Increas-\ning levels of norepinephrine and dopamine interact such that above\nthreshold, the balance shifts from prefrontal executive functioning to\namygdala-mediated memory encoding and posterior-subcortical auto-\nmatic responding (fight-flight-freeze).\n3. In this sense, of course, the constructivist account skirts circularity\nbut gets round it by the assumption of the gradual emergence of the men-\ntalising capacity.\nNo (social) construction without\n(meta-)representation: Modular mechanisms\nas a basis for the capacity to acquire an\nunderstanding of mind\nTim P.

Part of their \nargument is that other theoretical accounts underestimate, and \nindeed are inconsistent with, evidence for correlations between \nindexes of social interaction and the development of an under-\nstanding of mind. The authors single out theories that posit an in-\nnate modular basis to the capacity to acquire a \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d\nsaying that such theories \u201c[live] uneasily with the accumulating ev-\nidence, such as the sibling effect . . ., showing that the nature of\nthe social interaction children experience is closely related to the\ndevelopment of their social understanding\u201d (target article, sect.\n2.2, para. 5).\nThough common, the authors\u2019 view misrepresents the modular\ntheory as claiming that \u201cthe solution to this problem of under-\nstanding the mind\u201d is somehow \u201cinnately given\u201d (sect. 2.2, para.\n5). The authors even contrast the modular view with the view that\nthe capacity to acquire an understanding of mind is innate. But it\nis precisely this latter claim that is endorsed in the modular frame-\nwork: \u201ctheory of mind\u201d is described as having an innate and pos-\nsibly modular basis, not as consisting in its entirety as either innate\nor as a module (Leslie 2000; Scholl & Leslie 1999; 2001). The\nmodular view is also commonly accused \u2013 and the target article is\nno exception \u2013 of being inconsistent with demonstrations that\nthere is \u201cdevelopment\u201d in the domain of understanding mind. Yet,\nroles for both known developmental mechanisms, namely, matu-\nration and learning, are described in the modular theory that the\nauthors attack: Maturation of hardwired mechanisms enables the\nchild to make appropriate sense of social inputs and hence to learn\nabout the social and mental worlds (see German & Leslie 2000).\nIn a section on future research directions, the authors bemoan\nthe imprecision of what the term \u201cunderstanding\u201d might mean in\nthis domain (sect. 5, para. 6). Here we agree, and we draw their\nattention to the fact that in the modular approach they reject, in-\ntuitions about what should constitute having or not having \u201cun-\nderstanding\u201d have been replaced by attempts to specify underly-\ning cognitive mechanisms, to delineate what their inputs are, to\ncharacterize the representations they deploy, and to study how\nthey interact with domain-general processing mechanisms in solv-\ning \u201ctheory of mind\u201d problems (e.g., German & Leslie 2001; Leslie\n1987; 2000; Leslie & Polizzi 1998).\nThroughout this same section, the authors themselves call for\nresearch to \u201cmove from the intriguing findings relating individual\ndifferences in the social experiences of infants and their social un-\nderstanding to research that explores the processes involved\u201d\n(sect. 5, para. 4). But, despite a laudable insistence on the impor-\ntance of models of process, they offer not a single proposal about\nhow \u201cconstruction of understanding of mental states from social\ninteraction\u201d is supposed to work. Instead, it is left to \u201cfuture re-\nsearch\u201d to answer questions such as: \u201chow . . . mothers\u2019 tendency\nto talk about their infants in psychological terms is positively as-\nsociated with their child\u2019s understanding of false beliefs almost\nfour years later?\u201d (sect. 5, para. 4).\nWhat is instructive about these gaps is that the modular frame-\nwork, far from \u201cliving uneasily\u201d with the importance of social in-\nput, is the only approach that has concrete proposals about how\nsocial factors play their role. As Roth and Leslie (1998) put it, \u201cthe\nemergence of [the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d mechanism] solves a critical\nbut limited problem. It allows the young brain to attend to . . .\nmental states despite the fact that such states cannot be seen,\nheard, felt, or otherwise sensed . . . [and] being able to attend to\nmental states is a prerequisite for learning about those states\u201d\n(p. 27; emphasis in original). The ability to attend to mental state\nproperties, such as pretending and believing, is a critical part of\nwhat makes the social world the world it is and a critical part of\nwhat makes experience of that world into social experience. With-\nout this ability, though he or she may be constantly surrounded by\nplayful laughter, a child develops in social isolation; such is the lot\nof the child with autism. Beyond this basic ability lies the later suc-\ncess in answering questions about false beliefs. Here again, the\nmodular theory has made concrete proposals about how the child\nlearns about these social situations, learning things like \u201cbeliefs\ntend to be false under systematic circumstances, surprise occurs\nwhen a false belief is relieved, false beliefs can be induced in op-\nponents . . . [and] how to achieve the latter and get away with\nit.\u201d(Roth & Leslie 1998, p. 28).\nC&L rightly remind us of the danger of \u201cneurotic task fixation\u201d\n(sect. 4.1, para. 4; see Bloom & German 2000), and rightly ac-\nknowledge that meta-analysis cannot resolve the question of\nwhether there is conceptual change (see Scholl & Leslie 2001).\nYet they make the very mistakes they warn against by implicitly as-\nsuming that \u201cunderstanding\u201d the concept of belief is just the same\nthing as passing a false belief task. In particular, the authors fail to\ndistinguish competence and performance in their interpretation\nof the false belief task, and, hence, in their interpretation of its cor-\nrelation with indexes of social interaction.\nPositive associations between indexes of social interaction\n(number of siblings, security of attachment, maternal mind-mind-\nedness, parenting style, etc.) and mental state \u201cunderstanding\u201d\nmay be the result of many different factors in many different\nmixes. Plausibly, some of these factors reflect shared genotypes,\nsome the structure and richness of inputs to relevant learning\nmechanisms, and of course, let us not forget good old-fashioned\npractice \u2013 in this case, practice with social cognizing. The studies\nreviewed by the authors under this heading have invariably\ndemonstrated correlations with performance on a false belief task.\nThere is already good evidence for a strong heritable component\nto false belief performance (Hughes & Cutting 1999). There is\nalso mounting evidence suggesting that an important, and perhaps\ncritical, factor in performance on false belief reflects inhibitory\nprocesses that develop across the early years (Carlson et al. 1998).\nCuriously, there is also at least one demonstration of a sibling ef-\nfect on executive tasks without replication of the sibling effect on\nfalse belief (Cole & Mitchell 2000). It is even possible that corre-\nlations between various social indexes and \u201ctheory of mind\u201d are\nmediated by domain-general processes.\nIn conclusion, it is only by developing models of successful per-\nformance on various component \u201ctheory of mind\u201d skills, such as\nrecognition of agency in infancy (e.g., Johnson 2003), pretend play\n(Leslie 1987; 1994), belief-desire reasoning (Leslie & Polizzi\n1998), and recall of the contents of one\u2019s own past mental states\n(Barreau & Morton 1999), and by studying their specific neu-\nrocognitive basis (Frith & Frith 1999; Gallagher & Frith 2003)\nthat we can hope to understand how the brain has been organized\nto acquire this important knowledge base.\nIndividualism and cognitive development\nPhilip Gerrans\nDepartment of Philosophy, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005,\nAustralia. philip.gerrans@adelaide.edu.au\nhttp:\/\/www.adelaide.edu.au\/philosophy\/people\/pgerrans\/\nAbstract: Individualism is not inconsistent with social interaction; it is re-\nquired to explain it.

In order to cognise the\nworld in this way, the child does not need to possess a fully fledged\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 107\nintentional psychology; rather, she possesses a set of cognitive\nmechanisms whose proper function is to sensitise her to possibil-\nities for intentional engagement with her surroundings. As a re-\nsult of this engagement, the normal child will develop the con-\ncepts of intentional psychology.\nI take it Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) would agree with this char-\nacterisation; however, their approach does not lead to any deeper\nunderstanding of either the mechanisms which initially sensitise\nthe child to her social environment, or those which subsequently\nlead to the type of conceptual understanding tested in false belief\nand other \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (TOM) tasks. There are two reasons.\nFirst, they endorse Wittgenstein\u2019s argument that cognitive com-\npetence is mastery of a practice best understood as a skill rather\nthan an intellectual or theoretical achievement. Second, the au-\nthors do not connect their account of social understanding to the\nunderstanding of autism. The two issues are related.\nWittgenstein gives no explanation of the way social interaction\nproduces social understanding. This is because he regards it as an\nessentially unanalysable skill which, once acquired, allows the sub-\nject to perceive mental states directly. His reasons for rejecting in-\ntellectualist accounts of skill acquisition (fast, fluent, and flexible\nresponses cannot be governed by rules understood as algorithmic\nreductions of theoretical inferences) combine with his conceptual\nanalysis of the concept of an intentional state. The folk concept,\nproperly analysed, of an intentional state is not that of a covert\ncause of overt behaviour. Social understanding feels like immedi-\nate and non-theoretical recognition of mental states exhibited in\novert behaviour, and that is because the cognitive process involved\nis a skill and not a theoretical inference (Wittgenstein 1953\/1968).\nThis may be so, but this is no recipe for developmental psy-\nchology, which is, quite rightly, concerned with the neurocogni-\ntive processes involved in concept acquisition. For example, it\nwould not do simply to say that after a period of social interaction\ncertain aspects of the child\u2019s linguistic environment (prosody,\nchanges in amplitude) become \u201ccriterial\u201d for language under-\nstanding. Some explanatory hypothesis is required about the na-\nture of the cognitive processes implemented in developing neural\narchitecture. Is the child processing phonology or syntax? How is\nthe relevant information represented and manipulated? It seems\nuninformative to say that as a result of social interaction children\nacquire the ability to hear sentences as meaningful, but that is pre-\ncisely what Wittgenstein said. The best way to comprehend the\nprocess is via a metaphor \u201cLight dawns over the whole.\u201d But it is\nsimply not true that the psychological explanation of concept ac-\nquisition is exhausted by analysis of its phenomenology. And it is\ndoubtful that the philosophical understanding is, either.\nEarly cognitivists reconstructed these questions as questions\nabout the construction and confirmation by the developing child\nof theories of the linguistic domain, implemented ultimately in\nneural architectures. Perhaps this is slightly over-intellectual, but\nthe issue of what information is relevant to cognition of a particu-\nlar domain and how it is computed is still essential. Furthermore,\nthat is a question about what is going on in the mind of the indi-\nvidual who acquires a language. Putting it this way does not ex-\nclude social interaction but it allows us to say why certain aspects\nof social interaction are more significant than others and why some\nchildren rather than others develop the relevant concepts in re-\nsponse to that interaction.\nWithout such a theory, a linguist would be forced to say that\nchildren with, say, Specific Language Impairment (SLI ) do not\nacquire language normally because their linguistic interactions are\nabnormal. True, but is this because they lack acoustic or phono-\nlogical information? The ability to process it? Or do they lack some\nform of grammatical processing? One cannot say that one is con-\ncerned only with normal development, because the adequacy of a\nmodel of normal development is evidenced by its ability to predict\nand explain characteristic developmental abnormalities. Similarly\nfor other psychological capacities: much, if not most, of our knowl-\nedge of normal function depends on abnormal cases.\nThe same is true of social understanding. Indeed, the TOM hy-\npothesis was originally advanced to explain the difference be-\ntween normal and autistic children. Perhaps the TOM idea is\noverly intellectual and perhaps (as the authors argue persuasively)\nTOM is not a cognitive monolith. In that case autism is unlikely to\nbe a monolith either. But we are then left with the idea that there\nis a multiplicity of cognitive mechanisms involved in social under-\nstanding that reciprocally interact in a developmental cascade in\nboth normal and abnormal cases. Such a view seems entirely con-\nsistent with methodological individualism, which is just the at-\ntempt to find out what it is about cognitive architecture that en-\nables the normally developing child, first, to become embedded\nin her social world and, second, to scaffold her development us-\ning social interaction. Social exchanges, evidenced in gaze moni-\ntoring, social referencing, emotional responses, protodeclarative\nand imperative pointing, pretence, play, and conversation, all play\na role, but the nature of that role is opaque without an under-\nstanding of the cognitive mechanisms on which it depends.\nThe rejection of methodological individualism reflects a debate\nin cognitive science over the explanation of skills (of which inten-\ntional understanding certainly is one). Some argue that \u201cknow-\nhows,\u201d the fundamental capacities on which skills depend, should\nbe identified with socially acquired dispositions. Others argue that\nthe acquisition of those dispositions itself depends on some fun-\ndamental capacities that are essentially computational and inter-\nnal to the mind of the individual acquiring the skill. For almost any\nskill, it turns out that its ultimate explanation is the computational\none: Think of recognising faces, catching a ball, learning a lan-\nguage, or playing at dressing up. Furthermore, the phenomenol-\nogy of skill acquisition is a poor guide to the nature of those com-\nputational processes. For this reason, we should be sceptical of any\naccount that is essentially nothing more than an elaboration of\nphenomenological insights.\nThe role of executive function in constructing\nan understanding of mind\nSuzanne Hala\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N1N4,\nCanada. hala@ucalgary.ca\nhttp:\/\/www.psych.ucalgary.ca\/People\/Faculty\/hala\/\nAbstract: Adopting a constructivist stance is not irreconcilable with exec-\nutive function accounts of emerging social understanding. The executive\nfunction view allows for a gradual transition in theory of mind, while spec-\nifying the underlying cognitive processes that push that development for-\nward. Executive function abilities can be seen as an important interac-\ntional component in the epistemic triangle.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) have done the field a great service in\nreminding us that the development of social understanding does\nnot take place in a social vacuum. They point out, quite rightly,\nthat the question of importance should not be whether early com-\npetence in social understanding exists; rather, the central focus\nshould be turned towards the processes that allow for the emer-\ngence of social understanding. The authors propose an alternative\nconstructivist account that promises to bridge the current di-\nchotomy that exists between those who adopt an individualistic\ndevelopmental approach versus those who subscribe to an encul-\nturation view. The inclusion of Chapman\u2019s (1991) \u201cepistemic tri-\nangle\u201d helps to further extend Piaget\u2019s constructivist theory to the\nsocial realm.\nAlthough C&L\u2019s proposal is highly laudable, nevertheless, as\nwas the case with Piaget\u2019s original account, important aspects of\nthe developmental process remain underspecified. That is, saying\nthat development is a constructive process tells us little about the\nexact nature of the cognitive functions that also contribute to de-\nvelopment of social understanding. The authors offer coherent\nobjections against three prominent theories that seek to explain\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n108 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nthe emergence of a so-called \u201ctheory of mind\u201d in young children:\ntheory-theory, simulation, and modularity accounts. They neglect,\nhowever, to address how a constructivist account might be related\nto a newer, rapidly maturing, alternative theoretical perspective \u2013\nthe executive function account.\nThe term \u201cexecutive function\u201d broadly refers to those cognitive\nfunctions that underlie goal-directed behavior and that are\nthought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Welsh et al.\n1991). A growing number of researchers maintain that gains made\nin executive function abilities in the preschool years contribute\nsignificantly to theory-of-mind performance (e.g., Carlson &\nMoses 2001; Carlson et al. 1998; 2002; Frye et al. 1995b; Hala &\nRussell 2001; Hala et al. 2003; Hughes 1998; Russell 1996; Zelazo\net al. 1997). As children increase their capacity to control and di-\nrect their own actions, they become able to view alternative\ncourses of action \u2013 including actions based on beliefs (Russell\n1996).\nIn contrast to the theories criticized by C&L, an executive ac-\ncount can readily incorporate the notion of a more gradual onset\nof social understanding. Development of both executive control\nand social understanding begin early and emerge over an ex-\ntended period of time. Indeed, the precocious performance found\nin many \u201cmodified\u201d false belief and deception tasks (which the au-\nthors highlight as increasing personal or social activity) may be ex-\nplained in terms of reductions in the executive demands of the\ntasks.\nTo illustrate: typical false belief tasks draw on at least two exec-\nutive demands: (1) working memory (of where the object was in\nthe beginning or what the child thought was in a box) combined\nwith (2) inhibitory control (inhibit pointing to the spot where the\nobject is now known to be or reporting what one now knows is re-\nally in the box). Recent research has confirmed that those execu-\ntive tasks that combine both working memory and inhibitory con-\ntrol are most strongly related to theory-of-mind performance\n(Carlson et al. 2002; Hala et al. 2003). Reducing one or both of\nthese executive demands may result in improved performance.\nFor example, Freeman and Lacoh\u00e9e (1995) found that having\nchildren \u201cpost\u201d a picture of what they thought was in a box helped\nthem later to recall their own false belief in a contents task. Al-\nthough personal activity is certainly increased in this version, at\nthe same time so are the executive demands reduced (in this case,\nworking memory). Similarly, reducing the inhibitory demands of\ndeception tasks also results in improved performance (Carlson et\nal. 1998; Hala & Russell 2001), whereas simply removing the op-\nponent \u2013 and hence reducing the social demands \u2013 does not (Hala\n& Russell 2001). The reverse pattern is also found. That is, in-\ncreasing the inhibitory demands of theory-of-mind tasks detracts\nfrom performance (Leslie & Polizzi 1998).\nThough I use these examples of modified tasks to illustrate that\na more gradual onset of social understanding is consistent with an\nexecutive account, I am not claiming that it is simply information-\nprocessing complexities of specific tasks that stand in the way of\nyoung children and their supposed theories of mind. Instead, I,\nand others, suggest that there is a deeper relation between exec-\nutive function and developing social understanding. Exactly what\nthis relation is has yet to be specified. Development of executive\nfunction may make possible the emergence of a theory of mind\n(Moses 2001). Alternatively, it may be that a strong relation is con-\nsistently found between theory of mind and executive control, not\nbecause one is causally implicated in the other in a linear fashion,\nbut because the two are interdependent in their development.\nAdmittedly, the bulk of the research on the relation between ex-\necutive function and social understanding is of the individual-dif-\nferences variety and has not, as yet, wed itself to charting the so-\ncial interactions the child is surrounded by. In principle, however,\nthe executive and constructivist accounts are not mutually exclu-\nsive. Interaction with others challenges children\u2019s current execu-\ntive abilities, and, in Piaget\u2019s terms, adaptation in knowledge struc-\ntures may result, leading to increased knowledge and flexibility in\ntheir thinking about their own and others\u2019 mental lives. As chil-\ndren grow in their executive function abilities, they become more\nadept at interacting with and understanding others.\nIntroducing executive function ability into the epistemic equa-\ntion affords a view of the process of development as bidirectional.\nAs has long been maintained by those who adopt a dynamic sys-\ntems approach (e.g., Bronfenbrenner 1989; Gottlieb 1991; Scarr\n& McCartney 1983\/1984), the characteristics of the child influ-\nence the response of the environment just as the environment in-\nfluences the child. In this vein, children\u2019s executive maturity will,\nat least in part, influence how their parents respond to them,\nwhich in turn will influence and further enhance their developing\nexecutive control and social understanding.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe author is supported by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Eco-\nnomic Research Council, Canada.\nUnderstanding self and other\nR.

What features of intersubjective coordination are\nessential for the growth of concepts about the mind, and how does devel-\nopment proceed on this basis? Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) offer many\ntelling insights, but their account begs questions about the earliest forms\nof self-other linkage and differentiation, especially as mediated by\nprocesses of identification.\nThe article by Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) is an important cor-\nrective to contemporary misconceptions about the development\nof interpersonal understanding. The authors analyse distortions\nintroduced by individualistic \u201ctheory of mind\u201d perspectives that\npurport to show how children might derive concepts (even con-\ncepts of mind) without appropriate forms of interpersonal en-\ngagement, and they highlight the equally devastating limitations\nof simulationist accounts that presuppose understanding of one\u2019s\nown mind as a basis for understanding the minds of others. The\narguments they marshal from Wittgenstein and Chapman in par-\nticular are, in my view, decisive. As C&L indicate, a theory in\nwhich social exchanges are constitutive of understanding does not\nlead to cultural relativism. On the contrary, it is only through in-\nvolvement with others that human beings are in a position to ac-\ncord objective reality the status it deserves, and only when objec-\ntive reality is conceived as such do concepts such as \u201cbelief\u201d gain\na purchase. Moreover, mutual interpersonal relations that entail\ncommunication and reference vis-\u00e0-vis a shared external world\nprovide a necessary basis for uniquely human ways of (1) acquir-\ning knowledge about that world; (2) understanding what it is to be\na person with alternative psychological perspectives on that world;\nand even (3) thinking symbolically and creatively about people\nand things and constructing concepts with which to think.\nHow, then, should we frame our account of early human devel-\nopment if we are to elucidate how all this is possible and how de-\nvelopment proceeds from its starting point? Here I wonder\nwhether C&L are sufficiently radical in their revamping of theory.\nConsider how concepts of \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d are integral to con-\ncepts of mind. There is a paradox at the heart of any attempt to\nreconcile developmental accounts of self-other understanding\nthat focus on the individual\u2019s cognitive endowment, on the one\nhand, and social influences, on the other. The paradox is that an\nindividual has to have bedrock experience of the social as social in\norder to build upon this to construct progressively elaborated un-\nderstandings of minds as connected and differentiated centres of\nconsciousness. Without some primitive modes of experiencing self\nas self in relation to others, and of others as others in relation to\nself, it is difficult to see how concepts of self and other could be\nderived. (Note: this does not mean that infants, even infants at the\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 109\nend of the first year of life, have concepts or \u201cunderstandings\u201d of\nthe mental lives of others.)\nThe direction in which C&L move on this one, is to stress the\nactivities within which human interaction is embedded, adopting\nwhat they call \u201ca relational, action-based perspective\u201d within\nwhich communicative interaction also plays an essential role. Yes,\nbut what is the grounding for communication? When the authors\nstate that \u201cChildren\u2019s social knowledge is based on action\u201d (sect. 3,\npara. 4), they are in danger of losing the plot. The crux is how in-\nfants experience the activities and attitudes of self and other in in-\nterpersonal relations, not merely how they act or interact with oth-\ners. C&L refer to the embodied nature of human exchanges, but\nthey do little to explain how infants are aware of persons as hav-\ning a mental as well as physical dimension, and how the nature of\nthis awareness is such as to allow for the partitioning into what be-\nlongs to the other and what to the self over successive phases of\ndevelopment. What we need to explain, after all, is how a child\ncomes to understand persons as centres of individual experience,\nnot merely as centres of causality, and how the child\u2019s concepts\nabout the different facets of subjective orientation towards the\nworld (intentions, feelings, wishes, beliefs, and so on) develop in\nthe early years of life. Alongside this, we need to account for the\nforms of reflection and thinking about people \u2013 oneself as well as\nothers \u2013 that such concepts entail.\nI think the solution to the conundrum is that humans are\nequipped with a propensity for forms of role-taking that both link\nan individual infant or child or adult with someone else, and at the\nsame time register the distinctiveness of self and other. At first\nsuch role-taking is cognitively unelaborated, not yet amounting to\nunderstanding: It takes place without pre-existing thought and in\na manner that is heavily imbued with emotion. From early in life,\nchildren are moved by the attitudes of others: They are drawn to\nidentify with the psychological stance of a person with whom they\nengage. It is through this mechanism that mutual relations with\nothers vis-\u00e0-vis a shared world yield the ability to relate to one\u2019s\nown mental relations, and with this, creates a kind of mental space\nwithin which new forms of thinking are possible. A prime exam-\nple of how individuals interiorize the social, Vygotsky-style.\nThere is another sense in which this approach is more radical\nthan that of C&L. These authors give weight to the influence of\nmother-child as well as peer relations in the ability to acquire and\napply concepts of mind. Here the active ingredients of develop-\nment are conceptualised in terms of cooperative social interaction\nand exposure to talk about mental states. No doubt these things\nare important. Beyond this, however, powerful socio-emotional\nforces are at play.\nEspecially when you are in the heat of relating to others, it can\nbe an emotionally taxing business to think flexibly and to deploy\nmental concepts effectively. Critically important for the early de-\nvelopment of this capacity are young children\u2019s relations with at\nleast one other person who is able to tune into their minds. The\ndevelopmental influences are not merely intellectual, they are also\nemotional. Studies in developmental psychopathology reveal that\nin order to employ mind-related thinking effectively, one needs to\ndo more than construct understanding. To maintain a reflective\nstance towards one\u2019s own and others\u2019 minds, one also needs to be\nin appropriate forms of relation with oneself and others. Emo-\ntional relatedness towards persons-as-represented in the mind is\na vital force in intrapsychic as well as interpersonal functioning,\nand such relatedness and representation are powerfully influ-\nenced by identification with the attitudes of others.\nThe sources of mentalistic understanding involve much more\nthan action, even co-action with others.\nThe sibling relationship as a context for the\ndevelopment of social understanding\nNina Howe\nDepartment of Education, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1M8,\nCanada. nina.howe@education.concordia.ca\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) provide a convincing argument for\nhow children construct social understanding through social interaction.\nCertainly mothers are important in family interaction; however, sibling in-\nteraction may also be key in the process of developing social understand-\ning. In particular, the highly affective and reciprocal dynamics of the sib-\nling relationship in both positive and conflictual interaction may be critical.\nJeremy Carpendale and Charlie Lewis (C&L) have provided an\ninsightful and thoughtful discussion of the development of chil-\ndren\u2019s social understanding. To quote these authors, \u201cWhat bene-\nfits can be gained by adopting a constructivist approach to the de-\nvelopment of children\u2019s social understanding?\u201d (target article,\nsect. 5). To my mind, there are many. First, as they indicate in their\nreview of the theory of mind (TOM) literature, the focus on the\nFalse Belief Task has become very narrow and convoluted in its\nperspective. Indeed, this literature suffers from the \u201cneurotic task\nfixation\u201d syndrome that the authors outline. Lab studies can in-\nform us only to a certain degree about children\u2019s development and\nthey frequently suffer from overcontrol, a nondevelopmental per-\nspective, and fail to consider the importance of the familial con-\ntext. Ultimately, such a path may doom the field to a slow and\npainful death; the history of psychology is littered with many such\nexamples.\nHowever, C&L provide an escape from this depressing sce-\nnario. Humans are social, and therefore to study TOM or, as I pre-\nfer, social understanding, within the context of relationships seems\nultimately a more satisfying, and theoretically compelling and con-\nstructive, approach. By placing children\u2019s development within the\ncontext of social relationships, the authors provide a framework\nfor their constructivist view of social understanding. As they ar-\ngue, there is a long tradition of constructivist ideas regarding chil-\ndren\u2019s development. Indeed, in the field of early childhood edu-\ncation, this approach has long acquired popularity. The notion that\n\u201cunderstanding comes through action\u201d has been a fixture of early-\nyears programs for many decades and is one of the basic premises\nof currently fashionable constructivist programs such as Reggio\nEmilio\u2019s.\nThus, I am in basic agreement with C&L\u2019s premises, but some\nimportant points should be emphasized more strongly. Clearly, it\nis not the quantity but the quality and nature of children\u2019s close re-\nlationships that are important for social understanding. For more\nthan 20 years, Judy Dunn\u2019s work (see Dunn 2002) has suggested\nthat the quality of young children\u2019s relationships is related to their\nsocial understanding. She has been a leader in reminding us that\nchildren\u2019s social worlds involve more than just parents and that\nchildren spend considerable amounts of time with other young-\nsters, especially siblings, but also peers. The field of child psy-\nchology has suffered from a focus on the mother-child relation-\nship, and, to some degree, C&L fall into this trap. One of their\narguments is that triadic interactions are key to the development\nof social understanding. Certainly mothers are important (we\nknow very little about fathers in relation to social understanding),\nbut the power of the dyadic sibling relationship should not be\noverlooked once again. Dunn (2002) emphasizes that particular\nrelationships are important, namely those in which children have\na vested interest and which are colored by intense affective di-\nmensions, because these elements may provide the motivation for\nmaking one\u2019s points understood. The reciprocal nature of the sib-\nling relationship, as opposed to the more complementary or hier-\narchical parent-child relationship, affords children many oppor-\ntunities to develop their social understanding in the context of\nongoing interaction.\nC&L have identified cooperative parent-child relationships as\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n110 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nkey because they allow for free communication, which should fa-\ncilitate understanding others\u2019 minds. Yet, the nature of comple-\nmentary relationships by definition places certain constraints on\nfreedom of communication that are not as present in more recip-\nrocal relationships with siblings and peers (Hinde 1979). Fur-\nthermore, the authors give little attention to the role of social con-\nflict as another possible context in which children develop social\nunderstanding, yet there is a literature providing support for this\nview (Dunn 2002; Howe et al. 2002; Shantz & Hartup 1992). In\nparticular, the work that has focused on constructive versus de-\nstructive conflicts holds important promise here. In the context of\nconstructive conflict resolution, children must demonstrate the\nability to negotiate and resolve disagreements in ways that demon-\nstrate their understanding of the partner\u2019s position, often marked\nby their use of mental state language. Another area that has po-\ntential to add to the strength of C&L\u2019s argument is the literature\non shared meanings in pretend play. Again, when children have a\nvested interested in constructing a dynamic play scenario, they\nmust extend and build onto each other\u2019s ideas in ways that indi-\ncate that they have developed a joint understanding of one an-\nother\u2019s minds (e.g., G\u00f6nc\u00fc 1993; Lillard 2002). In sum, siblings are\nfrequent partners in this process because, as any parent knows,\nwho is there better to play with and fight with than your sibling?!\nAlthough I have followed the TOM literature for a long time,\npartly because it has been the fashion leader of social cognition\nand promised to address some important issues, ultimately it is a\nnarrow literature. I have often wondered what the cognitive shift\nat age four, as identified through the false belief task, had to do\nwith the real world of children. It took me a long time to make the\nconceptual connections between TOM and the social-under-\nstanding work of Judy Dunn and others. Dunn\u2019s work has clearly\nshown that the development of social understanding is fascinating\nwhen we examine children in their real-world context as they (1)\nmake meaningful and practical decisions about advancing their\npoints of view convincingly, and (2) negotiate their way through\nthe complex and rich world of social interactions. Moreover, the\ndevelopment of individual differences in children\u2019s social under-\nstanding is clearly a fruitful area of future work. For children (and\nresearchers) there is a wealth of fascinating questions and prob-\nlems to address in figuring out how the social world works and how\nto understand the depth, breadth, and meaning of one\u2019s social re-\nlationships. This is a developmental process that probably takes a\nlifetime, but certainly extends past the age of five. If C&L have\npushed the social cognition field to recognize and address this\npoint, then they will have made a major contribution to the liter-\nature.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author was supported by a grant from the Social Science and Hu-\nmanities Research Council of Canada, and thanks William M.

Izard\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 10716.\nizard@udel.edu http:\/\/www.udel.edu\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) interesting and insightful article\ndid not integrate several potentially useful notions from emotion theory\nand research into their explanatory framework. I propose that emotions\nare indigenous elements of mind and that children\u2019s understanding of\nthem is fundamental to their understanding of the mental life of self and\nothers, understandings critical to the development of social and emotional\ncompetence.\nAt several points in their insightful article, Carpendale & Lewis\n(C&L) allude to the role of emotions in the construction and un-\nderstanding of mind. Yet, they typically move on to a discussion of\ncognitive or social cognitive processes without really integrating\nany aspect of emotion theory into their conceptual framework.\nFor example, they acknowledge the usefulness of Hobson\u2019s (2002)\nemphasis on the infant\u2019s emotional engagement in social interac-\ntions. Then, without further reference to the role of emotion, they\nimmediately make the point that the infant\u2019s ability to engage in\njoint attention depends on her understanding of causality. A con-\nsideration of the role of emotions in developing such understand-\ning and in constructing and understanding mind might broaden\nand strengthen their position. Some researchers have shown that\npeople make important decisions, especially in risky situations,\nlargely on the basis of emotion feelings. Such feeling-determined\ndecisions may come after careful cognitive analysis of the conse-\nquences (Loewenstein et al. 2001). Others now maintain that\nbrain systems involved in emotions become active when subjects\nperform tasks related to research on theory of mind (Zimmer\n2003).\nThus, both theory and research suggest the possibility of en-\nriching and expanding the authors\u2019 attractive concept of the epis-\ntemic triangle to create an emotion-cognition triangle. An emo-\ntion-cognition account of the construction and understanding of\nmind would emphasize three principles: (1) emotion feelings are\ndynamic indigenous components of mind that influence percep-\ntion and cognition; (2) emotion cognition can shape the world as\ninteresting, friendly, and cooperative, or as stressful, hostile, and\ncompetitive; and (3) emotion-related action will emerge as con-\nstructive or destructive behavior depending on the effectiveness\nof arousal regulation, the quality of the thought in emotion-cog-\nnition interactions, and the effectiveness with which one modu-\nlates the expressions of emotions in words and deeds.\nMost of the evidence for the existence of emotion feelings as in-\ndigenous components of mind comes from studies of infants\u2019 abil-\nities to perceive the facial and vocal expressions of others and to\nencode their own. Beginning as early as age three or four months,\ninfants discriminate between the facial and vocal expressions of\nseveral basic emotions. They respond to them, as well as to differ-\nent environmental conditions, in ways that suggest they can mean-\ningfully decode external emotion signals and respond sensibly to\ntheir own internal signals (Haviland & Lelwica 1987; Izard et al.\n1995; Sullivan & Lewis 2003; Sullivan et al. 1992; Weinberg &\nTronick 1994). If one accepts these findings as evidence that feel-\nings are natural elements of mind, two things follow. First, as part\nof the processes involved in the construction of mind, the infant\ncan learn various associations or connections between feelings, ex-\npressions, and contingent events (e.g., caregiver actions in re-\nsponse to infant\u2019s expressions of feelings). Second, an important\npart of the sense of self as causal agent can emerge from sensing\nthe contingency of emotion feelings (and expressions) and the\nchanges they induce in the social environment (Tronick et al.\n1977; Izard 1978; Malatesta et al. 1989). The processes underly-\ning these developments could surely play a significant part in the\nconstruction and understanding of mind. If emotions are indige-\nnous elements of mind, then understanding emotions is tanta-\nmount to understanding parts of mind, arguably the parts that\ndrive the workings of the other parts (Izard 2001; Tomkins 1962).\nEmotion cognition affects the construction and understanding\nof mind both in terms of its content and via ongoing information\nprocessing. It has two major aspects: (1) understanding or knowl-\nedge of emotion feelings, expressions, and functions; and (2) the\nfeeling-influenced information processing mechanisms involved\nin perception and thought. Emotion knowledge and emotion in-\nformation processing may play major roles in the development of\nprocesses often identified as aspects of theory of mind (Zimmer\n2003).\nEmotion cognition may have particular consequences for the\ndevelopment of social and emotional competence and the self-\nconcept. Emotion knowledge (EK) relates positively to social\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 111\ncompetence and inversely to various indexes of internalizing be-\nhavior (Denham 1998; Schultz et al. 2001). Indeed, EK in pre-\nschool children at risk predicts their social and academic compe-\ntence in third grade (Izard et al. 2001). By age 11 years, children\nlow in EK see themselves as anxious, depressed, and socially iso-\nlated (Fine et al. 2003). Furthermore, given certain environmen-\ntal conditions, and probably a genetic proneness to negative emo-\ntionality, a child can come to see others or their intentions as\ninteresting and friendly, or as hostile or frightening. A strong and\npersistent association exists between proneness to anger and ag-\ngression, on the one hand, and a hostile attribution or anger \nperception bias, on the other (Crick & Dodge 1994; Dodge &\nCoie 1987; Fine et al., in press; Schultz et al., in press). Thus,\nemotion perception or attribution biases help determine the con-\ntent of mind, as well as the direction of emotion-motivated ac-\ntion. These mental biases indicate that things went awry in the\ndevelopment of emotion-cognition relations and the construction\nof mind.\nThe association between proneness to anger and anger percep-\ntion bias illustrates an important emotion-cognition connection.\nSome research suggests an equally significant connection between\nemotion, emotion perception bias, and action (e.g., aggression),\nparticularly in peer-rejected children (Hubbard 2001). Their\nemotion perception bias and related proneness to anger and ag-\ngression undoubtedly affect the processes involved in the con-\nstruction of mind and in understanding the mind of others. Anger-\nand aggression-prone children show a strong tendency to see\nanger signals and hostile intentions where none exists (Crick &\nDodge 1994; Fine et al., submitted; Shultz et al., in press).\nEmotion action is conceived of as overt behavior determined or\nsignificantly influenced by emotion feelings. The effectiveness or\nadaptiveness of emotion action probably depends in large mea-\nsure on one\u2019s success in modulating emotion arousal, particularly\nintense emotion arousal in stressful social situations (Izard 2002).\nStrong and persistent expression of negative emotions apparently\nconstitutes mind stuff that may contribute to the development of\ntraits of personality. Negative emotion expression in the more\nstressful episodes of the Strange Situation (Ainsworth et al. 1978)\nat age 1.5 years predicted the personality trait of neuroticism at\nage 3.5, whereas modulated positive emotion expression pre-\ndicted conscientiousness and agreeableness (Abe & Izard 1999).\nOne might expect such traits and their expressions in social inter-\nactions and other behavior to figure prominently in the construc-\ntion and understanding of mind.\nThe space in between: The development of\njoint thinking and planning\nJennifer M. Jenkins and Keith Oatley\nDepartment of Human Development and Applied Psychology, University of\nToronto, 252 Bloor St. West, Toronto M5S1V6, Canada.\njenny.jenkins@utoronto.ca koatley@oise.utoronto.ca\nhttp:\/\/fcis.oise.utoronto.ca\/~jjenkins\/\nAbstract: We argue that theory-of-mind understanding has developed to\nfacilitate joint thinking and planning, defined as the creation of new men-\ntal objects that could not have been created by one mind. Three compo-\nnents of this ability are proposed: the mental architecture indexed by false\nbelief understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and the prioritization of\nthe joint mind over the individual mind.\nIntroduction. Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) are exactly right\nwhen they argue for a middle position between individual and en-\nculturation accounts of theory-of-mind understanding. Yet, for the\nsocial domain to be seriously considered in this realm where\npurely cognitive considerations have dominated, one must know\nwhich components of theory-of-mind understanding are influ-\nenced by individual processes. We suggest that the best way of\nidentifying the components is to argue back from the likely func-\ntion that theory-of-mind understanding serves in human life.\nOur proposal is that theory-of-mind understanding functions to\nenable the uniquely human activity of joint thinking, which is the\ncreation of new mental objects that could not have been created\nby one mind, and joint planning, which is the arrangement of plans\nthat could not be accomplished alone. Such joint mental processes\nare generative. One person\u2019s thought or suggested subgoal is con-\nveyed to someone else. The second person takes in the mental ob-\nject and transforms it. Transformations, slight enough so that new\nobjects can be assimilated by their recipients, provide the creative\nelements on which culture is based. For Winnicott (1971) they oc-\ncur in the \u201cspace in between\u201d people, a space of possibilities and\ngenerativity in which, as a person offers a thought to another per-\nson and the thought comes back transformed, something new hap-\npens. The building of scientific theory provides an adult example.\nOne scientist offers a theory and another, having assimilated de-\ntails of that theory, offers a revision. Reading a novel is another ex-\nample. As the reader engages with the thoughts of the writer, the\nreader\u2019s mind is transformed. In both examples, thoughts are gen-\nerated that are the product of two minds (Oatley 2003).\nFalse belief should be understood not as a stand-in for theory-\nof-mind understanding but as one of its components. We suggest\nthat three components enable joint thinking and joint planning, as\nshown in Figure 1: mental architecture (structure), domain-spe-\ncific knowledge base (content), and the prioritization of joint goals\nover individual goals (the motivation). Taking the dimension of in-\ndividual\/enculturation proposed by C&L, evidence suggests that\nthese three aspects have different developmental influences.\nMental architecture. To identify discrepancies between one\u2019s\nown thoughts and those of another, we need simultaneously to\nrepresent and compare two potentially conflicting mental objects.\nThis has been assessed by measures of false belief. In contrast to\nC&L, we suggest that existing data imply that development of\nfalse belief is most strongly influenced by individual factors. First,\nthe meta-analysis of Wellman et al. (2001) demonstrated that the\nage effect in false belief is substantial, unmoderated by other fac-\ntors, and universal. Hence, biological maturation goes a long way\nto achieving it. Second, in a sample unrestricted by age (e.g., zero\nto ten years old) effects of cognitive maturation on false belief\nwould be large and those of social factors, small. Social influences\nhave been shown to speed up acquisition (Cutting & Dunn 1999;\nJenkins & Astington 1996), but such influences are always demon-\nstrated within a very narrow age range, serving to enhance their\nrelative effect. Third, children without unusual cognitive impair-\nment such as autism, or unusual linguistic experiences such as be-\ning deaf with hearing parents, almost all acquire false belief un-\nderstanding. Except for the unusual cases, by about eight years old\nthere are no individual differences in this skill. Variation in family\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n112 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nFigure 1 (Jenkins & Oatley). The components of theory of mind\nunderstanding and their role in joint thinking and planning\nand cultural experiences becomes irrelevant: The false belief\nswitch gets turned on anyway.\nLanguage provides some of the architecture necessary for false\nbelief understanding (Astington & Jenkins 1999; Jenkins & Ast-\nington 1996), and insofar as social factors do speed up the acqui-\nsition of false belief understanding, this probably occurs through\nthe effect of social influences on language development. Recent\nevidence suggests that this may occur through the linguistic struc-\nture of complementation (de Villiers & Pyers 2002). Language\nalso contributes to our next proposed component: the content of\ndomain-specific knowledge.\nDomain-specific knowledge. Successful generative thinking and\nplanning between minds requires content knowledge of the domain\nunder discussion. We distinguish two aspects. One is the subject of\nthe discourse: cars, dance, engineering, genetics, and so on.\nHutchins (1987) investigated distributed cognition on a navy ship,\nand reported that successful performance in a seven-person navi-\ngation team required that team members had experience of the dif-\nferent roles in the team. This gave them content knowledge to un-\nderstand ambiguous utterances and to solve problems in a way that\nwas close to the perspective of others. A second aspect is talk about\nmental processes. If two people misunderstand each other, they\nmay introduce process talk to clarify meaning, intention, and so on.\nMental state talk is essential in such clarification: \u201cDo you remem-\nber?\u201d \u201cWhat did you think?\u201d \u201cAre you angry?\u201d The social process\nsuggested by C&L is clearly central to the development of such con-\ntent knowledge (Jenkins et al. 2003; Ruffman et al. 2002).\nPrioritization of joint goals. Only if one cares enough about the\ninternal experiences of others can the joint goal achieve promi-\nnence over one\u2019s own goals. Oatley and Larocque (1995) have\nshown that a whole class of errors in joint planning derives from\none person being committed to goals of the self rather than joint\ngoals. Bowlby (1971) described what he called goal-corrected\npartnerships, in which toddlers represent and act upon the goals\nof others through having experienced the same thing in their par-\nents\u2019 treatment of them. In support of this, Herrera and Dunn\n(1997) found that those children who had had their own goals rec-\nognized by parents and siblings earlier were more likely to play co-\noperatively with peers two years later. This aspect of theory-of-\nmind understanding is thus strongly influenced by the social\nprocesses outlined by C&L.\nConclusion. Our delineation of components of theory-of-mind\nunderstanding allows for increased conceptual clarity of social an-\ntecedents in development. False belief understanding occupies a\npivotal role in theory-of-mind development because it enables a\ntype of interaction between minds not otherwise possible (Jenk-\nins & Astington 2000). False belief and theory of mind are not syn-\nonymous. Once false belief has been acquired, other components\nof theory of mind become more important in explaining why in-\ndividuals differ in their capacity to enter into the minds of others.\nReconstructing children\u2019s understanding of\nmind: Reflections from the study of atypical\ndevelopment\nSusan R. Leekam\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Durham, Durham DH1 3LE, United\nKingdom. S.R.Leekam@durham.ac.uk\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) theoretical reconstruction of the\n\u201ctheory of mind\u201d problem offers new hope but still has far to go. The study\nof atypical development may provide some useful insights for dealing with\nthe work ahead. In particular I discuss three issues \u2013 the boundary prob-\nlem, the question of end states, and the issue of the centrality of triadic in-\nteraction.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) proclaim the end of theories of \u201cthe-\nories of mind\u201d as we know them. Hoorah! Social interaction wins\nthe vote. Out goes individualism, in comes relationalism. Old-\nfashioned accounts of understanding mind \u2013 theory formation, in-\ntrospectionism, enculturation, and modularity \u2013 are all dead.\nLong live constructivism! This view is good news for anyone who\nhas ever questioned the primacy of a cognitive account to explain\nsocial reasoning. It is also good news for anyone who has ever\nquestioned the lack of developmental emphasis in the study of\nchildren\u2019s understanding of mind. So C&L\u2019s theoretical recon-\nstruction brings new hope to the theory-of-mind weary.\nNow, the next question is how to pull it off. There is much work\nthat still needs to be done. Below I take up three issues \u2013 the\nboundary problem, the question of end states, and the issue of a\ncentral role for triadic interaction. For each I suggest ways in\nwhich research on atypical populations might give some caution-\nary insights on how to proceed with the work ahead.\nThe first issue is the boundary problem \u2013 a common theme in\nthe field. C&L aim to explain how children acquire \u201csocial under-\nstanding.\u201d This broad term refers to all manner of social knowl-\nedge, including knowledge of the mind. When it comes to detail-\ning how knowledge is actually constructed within social interaction,\nwouldn\u2019t it help to be specific about the boundaries of that knowl-\nedge? Understanding the mind as a representational device may be\na very different kind of knowledge than understanding of social\nrules, or the ability to talk about inner states and the role of social\ninteraction may differ for each of type of knowledge. C&L seem to\nagree that different types of social interaction experience may re-\nlate differently to particular types of social knowledge when they\nrefer to Peskin and Ardino\u2019s (2003) study. But if we want to try to\nunderstand better how social interactions actually work in helping\nto construct different types of knowledge, it may help to study an\natypical group with impaired social interaction \u2013 children with\nautism. For example, if children with autism lack basic social re-\nlatedness, is it possible that they are ever able to fully grasp the rep-\nresenting function of a symbol or representation, even when such\nsymbols or representations are removed from a social context?\nA second problem is how to avoid the notion of \u201cend states.\u201d In\nsection 4, C&L make developmental links between children\u2019s\nearly social interaction experiences and later social understanding.\nThis makes social understanding look like an end state or devel-\nopmental outcome. I do not think this is the intention. On the con-\ntrary, what C&L want to emphasise is \u201cprogressivity in develop-\nment,\u201d the idea of a movement away from an initial starting point\nrather than a directionality towards a predetermined endpoint\n(Chapman 1988a). But given the way the account is currently for-\nmulated, it is difficult to get a sense of the nature of this progres-\nsivity. The process of development, as they point out, is a problem.\nIdeas about development being embedded in activity, regularity,\nsocial practice, or conversations and involving transactions be-\ntween self and others have a long way to go. And we probably need\nto start at the beginning and look forward rather than trying to ex-\nplain social understanding backwards.\nThe study of atypical development may offer some insights\nhere. The way that development is modelled in neuroconstruc-\ntivist accounts of atypical development (Thomas & Karmiloff-\nSmith 2002) is to examine how precursor states may be related to\nparticular outcomes given different sets of constraints or circum-\nstances. Although the idea of predetermined end-states might not\nappeal, connectionist dynamic systems and transactional accounts\nall argue that development is emergent, that influences are bidi-\nrectional rather than unidirectional, and that development in-\nvolves a series of changes in a self-organising system. Capacities\nmay disappear and then reappear later, may peak and then decline\nwith time, and may start as general and become more specific. Or-\nganismic and systems theories also propose changes that include\nintegration of earlier accomplishments as experiences and abilities\nare integrated into the subsequent reorganisation of the system.\nA fuller account is still needed of the way in which develop-\nmental change proceeds over time from the starting state of social\ninteraction. However, the idea that development involves an inte-\ngration or reorganisation of earlier accomplishments is high-\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 113\nlighted in C&L\u2019s discussion of the epistemic triangle. Triadic in-\nteraction is given a central role in this account as it incorporates\nand integrates more basic dyadic skills. The centrality of triadic in-\nteraction is consistent with a view of development in which one\nform of knowledge is considered more complete or more ade-\nquate than other forms of knowledge. But how central is the role\nof triadic interaction? Does it supplant other forms of activity and\nknowledge? Does it remain central throughout development?\nOur research in autism (Leekam & Ramsden 2003) indicates that\nwhile triadic interaction difficulties are critically important, dyadic\ninteraction difficulties alone are a very powerful indicator of lan-\nguage and cognitive skills. Atypical groups, therefore, may give\nfurther insights into the continuity and discontinuity of link be-\ntween dyadic and triadic skills. For example, children with autism\nhave high levels of engagement with objects, whereas, in contrast,\nchildren with Williams syndrome have high levels of dyadic en-\ngagement with people and poor non-social knowledge. Both\ngroups have difficulties with triadic interaction. What kind of un-\nderstanding can be constructed from these different starting\npoints and how is the ongoing development of this understanding\nconstrained, facilitated, or transformed by experiences across\ntime? C&L\u2019s account may not be able to answer these questions\nyet but it provides a good starting point for constructing a new un-\nderstanding of children\u2019s understanding of mind.\nRich interactions and poor theories\nOrlando M. Louren\u00e7o\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Lisbon, 1649\u2013013 Lisbon, Portugal.\nOrlando@fc.ul.pt\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) critique of traditional accounts\nof \u201ctheory of mind\u201d is well taken, but the alternative theory they propose\nis premature at its best, unconvincing at its worst. The proposed theory is\nad hoc and confirmatory in its findings; vague and generic in its claims; and\nunjustified and unnecessary in its (putative) novelty.\nCritic John Horgan (1999) recently commented discouragingly\nabout progress in psychology: \u201cTheories of human nature never\nreally die; they just go in and out of fashion\u201d (pp. 6\u20137).\nI am extremely sympathetic to Carpendale & Lewis\u2019 (C&L\u2019s)\npaper because it presents a scholarly review of the literature on\nchildren\u2019s understanding of the mind. However, the authors\u2019 al-\nternative theory seems so ad hoc and vague that it conforms to\nHorgan\u2019s critique.\nAd hoc theory. When a new theory is proposed, one expects\nthat its authors will contrast the theory\u2019s ability to deal with em-\npirical findings against the ability of alternative theories. When\nthis is not the case, the findings invoked to support the new the-\nory are not critical, but confirmatory. In the present case, the find-\nings invoked by C&L are consistent not only with the authors\u2019 new\ntheory, but also with the approaches they criticize, and even with\ntheories the authors do not mention. For example, if the \u201csibling\neffect\u201d (with all its qualifications) found in children\u2019s social un-\nderstanding may be interpreted in terms of C&L\u2019s account, it may\nbe interpreted also in terms of (1) the theory-theory view, which\nstates that theories are revised because, among other things, \u201cchil-\ndren . . . depend on a social world . . . for much of the information\nthey will use in theory construction\u201d (Gopnik & Meltzoff 1998,\np. 19); (2) the simulation theory, which states that interactions\namong children help them understand their own and others\u2019 men-\ntal states (Harris 1991); (3) the enculturation perspective, which\nclaims that \u201cchildren internalize the folk psychology of their par-\nticular culture\u201d (Astington & Olson 1995, p. 184); (4) the experi-\nential approach, which \u201ctakes into account both the conditions of\nexperience in the specific social and cultural world, and also the\nphenomenology of experiencing on the part of the child\u201d (Nelson\net al. 2003, p. 25); and (5) even modular theories for which \u201cthere\nis nothing in the notion of modularity that prevents even matured\nmodules from learning and developing\u201d (Scholl & Leslie 2001,\np. 698). More generally, when findings are interpreted a posteri-\nori they can be made to accord with almost any theory. Hence,\nC&L\u2019s theory reminds us more of an approach to which data have\nto conform than one that conforms to the data.\nVague theory. C&L\u2019s main proposition is that the development\nof children\u2019s social understanding occurs within a triadic interac-\ntion involving the child\u2019s experience of the world as well as com-\nmunicative interaction with others about their experience and be-\nliefs (i.e., Chapman\u2019s [1991] epistemic triangle). Although true\nand of some heuristic value, this proposition is inherently vague.\nWithout further qualitative or, better still, quantitative specifica-\ntions, the proposition can be used, as is often the case throughout\nthe paper, to make almost any claim, to generate almost any pre-\ndiction, to explain almost any finding, to describe almost any psy-\nchological process, and to be applied to almost any developmen-\ntal phenomenon. For example, it is hardly new \u2013 perhaps it is plain\ncommon sense \u2013 that the psychological development of children\ninvolves an activity matrix made up of biological, social-cultural,\nand psychological dimensions. In the same vein, to expect that\nchildren do better on false belief tasks when they are actively in-\nvolved; to say that conversation about the mental world may be es-\nsential for the development of social understanding; and to de-\nclare that the extent and nature of social interactions experienced\nby children facilitates their development of social knowledge,\nhardly raises above common sense. What seems to be the great-\nness of C&L\u2019s theory \u2013 its apparent consistency with countless\nfindings, authors, and theories \u2013 may be the hallmark of its\nfragility, for only at the cost of remaining at a generic level can the\ntheory accord with almost anything psychological.\nConsider the following example. C&L maintain that although\nThelen and Smith\u2019s dynamic systems approach is in many ways\nconsistent with their account, the ideas of interactionism and\ntransactionalism make their account distinctly different. For, in\ncontrast with traditional children\u2019s \u201ctheories of mind,\u201d C&L\u2019s ac-\ncount integrates the social and individual dimensions of develop-\nment. However, because the two key concepts of interactionism\nand transactionalism were not specified, the authors\u2019 claim would\ncertainly be classified as vacuous by Thelen and Smith: \u201cInterac-\ntionism and transactionalism are everyone\u2019s comfortable buzz-\nwords, and the proffered \u2018solution\u2019 to the nature-nurture di-\nchotomy [and many others]\u201d (1994, p. xv).\nUnnecessary theory. C&L\u2019s account boils down to the idea that\nchildren\u2019s social understanding occurs within social interaction, is\ngradual, and involves an active subject. But when these claims re-\nmain at a simply verbal level they will not be powerful enough to\nsustain an alternative theory of individuals\u2019 social understanding,\nregardless of how flawed previous accounts may be. Without ad-\nditional specifications and elaborations, Piaget\u2019s appeal to con-\nstructivism and gradualism and Vygotsky\u2019s focus on social interac-\ntion do not need to be repeated. In addition, they do not justify\nyet another theory on children\u2019s social understanding. Because all\nsubjects behave and while behaving must perforce be active, we\nshould be careful when proposing theories whose essence relies\non the contrast between an active and a passive individual. What\ncounts as a subject\u2019s passive or active role in his or her psycholog-\nical functioning may be more a semantic problem \u2013 all too com-\nmon in disputes among weak psychological theories \u2013 than a sub-\nstantial problem (see Louren\u00e7o 2001).\nRegarding the necessity of C&L\u2019s account, I believe it does not\ngo any further in terms of claims, processes, or predictions than\nprevious developmental theories, such as those of Piaget, Vygot-\nsky, or Selman. For example, because Selman\u2019s (1980) theory\nidentifies five levels in individuals\u2019 interpersonal understanding,\nand also appeals to the idea of an active and interactive child, it\ngoes well beyond C&L\u2019s seemingly distinctive idea of the emer-\ngence of an interpretive theory of mind, which according to these\nauthors would be the second (and last) level in individuals\u2019 un-\nderstanding of the mind.\nIt might be argued that even if C&L\u2019s approach were reducible\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n114 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nto previous ones, the account would still be necessary because it\nallows us to explore five areas of urgently needed research, one of\nwhich would be a detailed analysis of infants\u2019 interaction. Ironi-\ncally, C&L are the first to recognize that some contemporary re-\nsearch of this sort already exists.\nIn summary, C&L\u2019s critique of traditional accounts of \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d is correct. However, in its present state their new theory is\nclearly premature \u2013 unless, that is, one favors the proliferation of\nweak psychological theories and the perpetuation of what Meehl\n(1978) has called the slow progress of soft psychology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI thank Armando Machado and Olga Pombo for their comments on an ear-\nlier version of this commentary.\nConstructing agents: Rethinking the how \nand what in developmental theories of \nsocial understanding\nVictoria McGeer\nPhilosophy Program, RSSS, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT\n0200, Australia. mcgeer@coombs.anu.edu.au\nhttp:\/\/www.sfu.ca\/neurophilosophy\/members\/mcgeer\/index.htm\nAbstract: Although I am broadly in sympathy with Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s\n(C&L\u2019s) version of social constructivism, I raise two issues they might ad-\ndress. One bears on the question of how social understanding develops: Is\ntheir resistance to individualism inappropriately combined with a resis-\ntance to internalism? A second question concerns a more radical implica-\ntion of their view for what social understanding is.\nThree cheers for Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) \u201cconstructivist\u201d\napproach to the development of social understanding, with its in-\nsistence on the gradualistic, action-oriented, and socially embed-\nded nature of this process. In C&L\u2019s view, developing children be-\ncome, not theoretically competent in a body of folk-psychological\n(FP) knowledge, but skilled social beings, able to demonstrate in\nmyriad ways their capacity-in-action to negotiate the complex,\nnormatively structured social world in which they and their fellows\nare embedded. I am broadly in sympathy with this account but\nraise two issues C&L might address. One bears on the question of\nhow social understanding develops, the other on what social un-\nderstanding is.\nLet me first address the question of how social understanding\ndevelops. By taking the skills approach, C&L are able to chart a\nconstructivist middle way between the extremes of \u201cindividual-\nism,\u201d which credits the child with having or doing too much in de-\nvelopment, and collectivism, which credits the child with having\nor doing too little. Yet despite C&L\u2019s focus on how development\noccurs \u2013 in particular, given their resistance to a passive and wholly\nmysterious view of social enculturation \u2013 their own account of this\nprocess, especially in early infancy, is mechanistically vague. How\ndo self-other differentiation and coordination gradually emerge\nwithin the context of parentally supported dyadic and triadic in-\nteractions? It has something to do with the infant\u2019s developing and\ncombining sensorimotor schemes, we are told, but the \u201criddle\u201d of\nthis emergence has yet to be solved.\nWhere do we look for the answer? C&L suggest it will be found\nin more detailed longitudinal analysis of behaviours that emerge\nin the context of such interactions. Although no doubt helpful, this\nleaves the mechanistic side of this puzzle quite untouched. I worry\nthat C&L\u2019s justifiable anti-individualism may seem to blend into\nless-justified anti-internalism, a resistance to investigating what\ncognitive\/perceptual mechanisms within the infant could support\nthe gradual emergence of progressively more skilled social be-\nhaviours.\nSuch mechanisms need not be so richly specified as to amount\nto a prewired capacity for social understanding, nor need they be\nsuch as to presuppose sophisticated (theory-like) processing of\nothers\u2019 intentional behaviour as such. They may be quite low-level\nmechanisms: for example, the mechanisms underlying early imi-\ntation, allowing infants to cross-modally map their own proprio-\nceptively experienced bodily movements onto like movements\nthat they see performed by others (Meltzoff 1990; Meltzoff &\nGopnik 1993; Meltzoff & Moore 1992). The progressive develop-\nment and combination of sensorimotor schemes would then be\nexplained, in the first instance, by the infant\u2019s primordial percep-\ntual urge to map what others do onto what they do themselves. Of\ncourse, this perceptual urge may soon be reinforced by the other\nbenefits that infants gain through such interactions \u2013 for example,\nepistemic benefits that derive from adults\u2019 intentional scaffolding,\nbut also, perhaps at first more importantly, the sensory\/affective\nregulative benefits suggested by C&L in connection with a lean\ninterpretation of early joint attention behaviour (Baldwin &\nMoses 1996; Gergely & Watson 1996; McGeer 2001).\nHowever, my point here is not to push any particular view, but\nto query C&L about their general attitude towards internalism\n(versus individualism). In connection with this, it is interesting to\nnote a parallel \u201cneuroconstructivist\u201d movement focused on inter-\nnal structures and mechanisms that attempts to chart a middle way\nbetween the extremes of nativism (too much prespecified struc-\nture) and empiricism (too little structure) to explain the develop-\nment of higher-order capacities through the child\u2019s interaction with\na progressively structured, even necessarily social environment\n(Elman et al. 1996; Karmiloff-Smith 1998; Quartz & Sejnowsky\n1997). Given the similarity of constructivist ambitions, there may\nbe fruitful connections to exploit between these two programs.\nNow to the question of what social understanding is. I begin by\nnoting that once the resistance to individualism is clearly sepa-\nrated from a needless resistance to internalism, C&L may well\navail themselves of a better way to characterize the infant\u2019s start-\ning state than one of relative nondifferentiation between self,\nother, and world. However true this characterization may be, it\nsuggests a lack of structure and\/or activity on the infant\u2019s part that\nseems to fit better with the enculturation model C&L rightly re-\nject. The infant is not a passive receptacle but active in construct-\ning skills in and through social relationships that eventually con-\nstitute the skills of a genuine folk-psychological agent, that is, of a\nperson who manifests his or her social understanding in myriad\nskillful ways of interpreting others and acting in the normative\nterms of folk-psychology.\nThe developmental challenge is therefore not so much one of\n\u201cdifferentiation\u201d as it is of transforming\/having transformed early\nmeaningless activities into the progressively more meaningful ac-\ntivities of a well-behaved folk-psychological agent. This charac-\nterization may constitute a subtle shift of emphasis, but its point\nis to bring out an important implication of C&L\u2019s approach not\nfully highlighted in their target article \u2013 namely, that \u201csocial un-\nderstanding\u201d is not just a body of knowledge, even in the sense of\nknow-how, allowing individuals to understand one another as in-\ntentional agents. It is, more significantly, a regulative practice \u2013\nthat is, a complex set of skills by means of which individuals regu-\nlate themselves in accord with the norms of folk-psychology,\nthereby themselves becoming well-formed agents from the folk-\npsychological point of view (McGeer & Pettit 2002). The devel-\nopment of \u201csocial understanding\u201d is therefore, in actuality, the \ndevelopment of social agency: a progressive enablement of indi-\nviduals\u2019 agential skills by means of which they are also progres-\nsively empowered to act and react in self-standing ways within a\ncommunity of others. All this is quite compatible with C&L\u2019s pro-\ngram: It merely raises the question of whether their substitution\nof the phrase \u201csocial understanding\u201d for \u201ctheory of mind\u201d goes far\nenough in capturing their sense of what children are constructing\nwithin social interaction.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis commentary was supported by the McDonnell Foundation through\na grant received from the McDonnell Project in Philosophy and the Neu-\nrosciences.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 115\nInfants\u2019 minds, mothers\u2019 minds, and other\nminds: How individual differences in\ncaregivers affect the co-construction of mind\nElizabeth Meins\nPsychology Department, University of Durham, Science Laboratories, South\nRoad, Durham DH1 3LE, United Kingdom. elizabeth.meins@durham.ac.uk\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) constructivist account needs\ngreater emphasis on how individual differences in caregivers\u2019 impact on\nthe efficacy of epistemic triangle interaction in fostering children\u2019s under-\nstanding of mind. Caregivers\u2019 attunement to their infants\u2019 mental states\nand their willingness to enable infants to participate in exchanges about\nthe mind are posited as important determinants of effective epistemic tri-\nangle interaction.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) argue that children are active partic-\nipants in acquiring mentalising abilities, constructing an under-\nstanding of mind during social interaction within the epistemic tri-\nangle. Their account represents an advance on individualistic and\nenculturation approaches to theory of mind (ToM) development,\nbut would benefit from a greater consideration of how individual\ndifferences in caregivers influence the efficacy of interaction in\nthe epistemic triangle in fostering an understanding of mind. In\norder for children to benefit most from social interaction in con-\nstructing a ToM, the interlocutor should be sensitive to and cog-\nnisant of the child\u2019s current state of mind. For example, in one of\nour longitudinal studies on the social determinants of ToM per-\nformance, we found that mothers\u2019 use of mental state language\nthat commented appropriately on their 6-month-olds\u2019 putative\nmental states was an independent predictor of children\u2019s ToM per-\nformance at age 4 (Meins et al. 2002). In contrast, indices of the\ngeneral quality of the mother-infant relationship (maternal sensi-\ntivity and attachment security) did not predict children\u2019s subse-\nquent ToM.\nWhat is perhaps most interesting about this study\u2019s findings is\nthat ToM performance was related to only certain kinds of early\nmental state language, and not to exposure to mental state talk in\ngeneral. Mothers\u2019 use of mental state language that appeared in-\nappropriate to the infant\u2019s current mental state, indicating that\nthey were misreading their infants\u2019 minds, was unrelated to later\nToM understanding. Hence, although C&L claim that their \u201cap-\nproach to the development of children\u2019s social understanding fo-\ncuses on the relations between people\u201d (sect. 2.1, para. 8, empha-\nsis in original), they need to move beyond the assumption that the\nsame form of relationship (e.g., mother-infant, child-sibling) will\nresult in the same form of interaction. At present, C&L provide a\ndetailed description of prerequisites required by the child to en-\ngage in constructive interaction in the epistemic triangle (e.g.,\njoint attention skills, a certain level of linguistic competence), but\nindividual differences in caregivers are not considered. Their ac-\ncount therefore places too much burden on the child\u2019s attributes\nin explaining individual differences in ToM understanding. In-\ndeed, C&L need to consider the possibility that the child\u2019s attri-\nbutes may initially be rather unimportant beyond giving the care-\ngiver an indication of basic competence.\nThere is also the issue of timescale. In setting up the epistemic\ntriangle as the context in which children construct an under-\nstanding of mind, the authors focus exclusively on infancy. Yet,\nthey seek to use their account to explain social influences on ToM\nthat come into play much later in development (sect. 4.2). For ex-\nample, the facilitative effects of sibling (Dunn et al. 1991b) and\npeer (Brown et al. 1996) interactions have been found only in the\npreschool period, and the sorts of parenting style found to relate\nto ToM performance (Ruffman et al. 1999) would appear to be ap-\nplicable only to children beyond infancy. Preschool children\u2019s so-\ncial interactions involve complex abilities, such as pretense, with\nperhaps several playmates, whereas the classic epistemic triangle\ninteraction involves a much more pared-down form of triadic ex-\nchange. It therefore seems that in focusing on preschool influ-\nences, C&L are trying to explain the \u201cwrong\u201d evidence. If epis-\ntemic triangle interaction is the means by which children con-\nstruct a ToM, the authors need to concentrate more clearly on so-\ncial-environmental factors that act during an earlier period of\ndevelopment.\nOf course, this is a difficult task, because very little long-term\nlongitudinal research on the social determinants of ToM exists.\nC&L mention one early social factor that has been linked to ToM\n(attachment security), but they need a much more thorough crit-\nical appraisal of how such differences in attachment are related to\nthe child\u2019s active construction of mind. For example, no author has\nproposed a direct link between attachment security and children\u2019s\nToM. Rather, certain precursors of attachment security, such as\nmaternal mind-mindedness (Lundy 2003; Meins et al. 2001) or\nmothers\u2019 internal working models of attachment relationships\n(Fonagy et al. 1991), are likely to be at the root of any observed\nsecurity-related differences in ToM. The epistemic triangle is an\nideal context for highlighting how caregiver attributes \u2013 their\nmind-mindedness, their willingness to interpret their infants\u2019 be-\nhaviours as having intention, their representations of their own\nchildhood experiences \u2013 are brought to bear on what they say to\ntheir infants and how they manage early dyadic and triadic inter-\nactions. Such a focus would also enable C&L to discuss in greater\ndetail how atypical development (e.g., deafness, autism) may af-\nfect the caregiver\u2019s ability to interact within the epistemic triangle,\nand thus, children\u2019s ToM development.\nIn order for the constructivist account to explain how the social\nenvironment influences ToM, it needs to address how the attri-\nbutes of the caregiver work in concert with those of the infant to\nprovide early interactions that will foster the child\u2019s understand-\ning of mind. Such interactions need to do more than merely en-\nsure that the child is exposed to mental state language. It is likely\nthat our finding that mothers\u2019 mind-related language at 6 months\npredicts later ToM performance is due in part to the fact that such\nlanguage is one facet of a broader picture of general attunement\nbetween mother and infant (e.g., Lundy 2003). An insufficient at-\ntention to the child- and caregiver-centred determinants of this at-\ntunement means that C&L\u2019s account is in danger of suffering from\nthe very failing that they complain about in traditional accounts of\nToM development, namely, the lack of an \u201cintegrated system\u201d\nwithin which social-environmental influences on ToM can be un-\nderstood. A more careful emphasis on caregivers\u2019 attributes (as\nwell as those of the child), and their willingness to allow children\nto participate in exchanges about the mind, would provide the au-\nthors\u2019 account with precisely such integration with the wider con-\ntext of social-cognitive development.\nStructure, genesis, and criteria\nCarol A.

Detailed description of the knowledge structure of\na developing theory of mind is necessary, and the notion of criteria for the\nuse of mental state terms requires consideration of the sentence structures\nin which such terms appear.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) make a timely contribution to current\ndebates regarding the development of theory of mind. C&L\u2019s em-\nphasis on the gradual development of theory of mind in the con-\ntext of interactions between child, other, and object provides a\nmuch-needed balance to the extremes of current accounts of the-\nory of mind development, which focus narrowly on processes\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n116 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nwithin the individual, or the cultural construction of psychological\nstates, and ignore the interface between individual and culture.\nHowever, we contend that C&L\u2019s approach needs to be extended\nand made more precise in order to fulfill its explanatory potential.\nTwo issues in particular are in need of elaboration: The first issue\npertains to the relation between structure and genesis, and the\nsecond to the concept of criteria.\nC&L provide a genetic account of the development of social un-\nderstanding in general, and theory of mind in particular. Their\nproposal, however, lacks any detailed description of the knowl-\nedge structure that characterizes different levels of social under-\nstanding. They briefly allude to three features that are required\nfor the acquisition of a theory of mind: (1) the assumption of a sta-\nble, external world; (2) the importance of the realization that there\nis access to information through seeing; and (3) attentional capac-\nity. None of these features, however, clarifies how understanding\nof, say, false beliefs differs from understanding of, say, the concept\nof seeing, or why the former is acquired at a later age than the lat-\nter. To the extent that C&L focus on the developmental mecha-\nnisms that lead to the acquisition of a theory of mind, their pro-\nposal is, in fact, compatible with a number of proposals that focus\nmore on the knowledge structure involved in theory of mind.\nOther proposals have tied this knowledge structure to metarepre-\nsentation (Perner 1991), confronting of perspectives (Perner et al.\n2002), the embedding of if-if-then rules (Zelazo & Frye 1997),\nworking memory (Gordon & Olson 1998), inhibition (Carlson &\nMoses 2001), and mastery of sentence complements (deVilliers &\ndeVilliers 2000).\nWithout a more detailed description of what is involved in a\ntheory of mind, the specific forms of social interaction that may\npromote or impede the development of a theory of mind (Turn-\nbull & Carpendale 1999a) remain underspecified. It is possible\nthat different aspects of social interaction contribute to different\naspects of the knowledge structure characteristic of theory of\nmind. For example, whereas the coordination of conversational\nturns may promote the increase of working memory, contrastive\nutterances may facilitate perspective-taking (Sabbagh & Callanan\n1998). The forging of closer links between social interactions and\nthe development of a theory of mind requires detailed descrip-\ntion of what is involved in the acquisition of a theory of mind. In\nfact, the close linkage of structure and genesis is one of the main\ntheses of Piaget\u2019s theory (1967, p. 147): \u201cGenesis emanates from a\nstructure and culminates in another structure\u201d (emphasis in orig-\ninal).\nC&L suggest that mental state terms are learned by observing\n\u201cthe patterns of activity that are criterial for the use of such men-\ntal state terms \u2013 that is, the pattern of interaction for which we use\nthese words\u201d (sect. 3.2, last para.). Following Wittgenstein, they\nreject the notion that mental state terms point to inner objects.\nHowever, the same arguments against the view of words as corre-\nlated with things also apply to the view of words as correlated with\nevents, that is, \u201cpatterns of activity.\u201d Lila Gleitman and colleagues\nhave cogently presented the case that words are not simply\nmapped onto events in the world (Gillette et al. 1999; Gleitman\n1990; Landau & Gleitman 1985). If a learner were to try to match\na single word to its contingencies in the world, the possible hy-\npotheses of the word\u2019s meaning are, if not infinite, certainly in-\ntractable, especially for verbs. Mental state terms would be par-\nticularly difficult to learn through word-to-world matching, as\npsychological states are not directly observable.\nIn other work, Carpendale argues that in order to understand\nthe role of talk in the development of theory of mind, one must\nset aside the traditional \u201ccode model\u201d of language (Turnbull &\nCarpendale 1999a). We would argue here that although \u201ctalk-as-\ninteraction\u201d is crucial to the development of theory of mind, the\nlanguage code itself is also important and must be integrated into\nan overall account of social interaction and theory of mind. The\nstructure of language is as important for learners as the way lan-\nguage is used.\nConsider the verb to think. The number of \u201cpatterns of activ-\nity\u201d that could reasonably occur in social interactions at about the\ntime when an adult utters the word think is huge. What common\nelements could be extracted from those situations and taken to\nconstitute the criteria for the use of think? Worse yet, thinking is\ngoing on all the time, yet talking about thinking is not. L. Gleit-\nman and colleagues (e.g., Gillette et al. 1999) have suggested that\nthe child can solve these difficulties by using, among other sources\nof information, the structure of the sentences in which mental\nstate terms appear as a cue to their meanings. For instance, men-\ntal state terms and communication terms take propositions as ar-\nguments. By noting the range of sentence structures in which a\nverb appears, the child can gain crucial information about its\nmeaning, for example, that mental states relate to propositions.\nAs C&L point out, \u201clanguage, or communicative interaction, is\nthe means through which children learn about other people\u2019s ex-\nperience and so develop a more complete set of criteria\u201d (sect. 3.2,\npara. 9). That set will not be complete unless it includes the sen-\ntence structures in which mental terms appear. We are very much\nin sympathy with C&L\u2019s approach to the study of theory of mind.\nWe suggest that a first step in moving the approach forward is a\nmore elaborated understanding of the relation between structure\nand genesis, and consideration of both the linguistic and nonlin-\nguistic contexts in which mental state terms are used.\nBeing able to understand minds does not\nresult from a conceptual shift\nPeter Mitchell\nSchool of Psychology, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham\nNG7 2RD, United Kingdom. peter.Mitchell@nottingham.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk\/staff\/plm\/home.html\nAbstract: If anything, Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) target article could\nhave gone even further in challenging the view that a radical conceptual\nshift equips children with a theory of mind. Also, the authors should have\nelaborated on why their social constructivist account is more plausible than\nnativism. Their argument against simulation theory is perhaps the least-\ndeveloped part of their thesis, and does little service to their cause.\nCarpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) thought-provoking target article of-\nfers a compelling account of the development of an understand-\ning of the mind, and will be welcomed as a refreshing and attrac-\ntive alternative to the rather ubiquitous \u201ctheory-theory\u201d and\nmodular accounts. On finding myself broadly in agreement with\nmost of the views expressed in the article, I shall confine com-\nments to matters of emphasis and the few areas of disagreement.\nFirst, though, the most significant aspect of the article deserves\nto be highlighted. The authors provide a convincing argument on\nthe gradual character of development in this important sphere of\nhuman functioning. On face value alone, it seems much more\nplausible than the popular claim from theory-theory that children\nundergo a singular radical conceptual shift. As Chandler and Hala\n(1994) persuasively argued, there are much more important and\ninteresting changes that occur both before children begin passing\na traditional test of false belief, and indeed afterwards. This brings\ninto focus a detrimental consequence of theory-theory\u2019s dominat-\ning position as the mainstream account: Attention has concen-\ntrated so heavily on what happens at four years of age that it has \neffectively blinded many researchers to developments in under-\nstanding the mind that occur both before and after this time. If\nC&L stimulate attention to developments taking place at these\nother times, it will have done a great service. Indeed, they could\nhave been even more ambitious and ventured further into the ter-\nritory of development beyond the age of four years.\nAnother aspect of the article that needs to be highlighted is the\nmuch-welcomed critique of Wellman et al.\u2019s (2001) claim to have\ndiscovered the truth about false belief. C&L correctly say that\nthese authors set up a straw person as an alternative to their (Well-\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 117\nman et al.\u2019s) favoured conceptual change account. Here, C&L\nshow restraint, for they could have pointed out that Wellman et al.\nwere highly selective in stating developmental trends that would\nbe predicted by rival accounts. Of course, it came as no surprise\nto find that children begin systematically giving incorrect judg-\nments in a test of false belief and then gradually change over a pe-\nriod of months such that the probability of giving a correct judg-\nment increases monotonically. In this context, C&L should have\npointed out two obvious things:\n1. Anyone who predicts sharp conceptual change should not be\npredicting a monotonic trend (as Wellman et al. curiously did), but\nan S-shaped function. That is, children should be predicted by this\nbrand of theory-theory to begin consistently giving an incorrect\njudgment, and then they should suddenly shift to giving correct\njudgments, and, on reaching that plateau, continue thereafter\nwith few or no errors.\n2. Those theory-theorists who believe in a radical conceptual\nshift seem not to have a satisfactory account of children\u2019s system-\natically incorrect judgments in a test of false belief (but see Perner\n1988; Wimmer & Hartl 1991). This is something that C&L also\nneglect, though in fairness the phenomenon does not threaten\ntheir account.\nTo get a sense of how problematical it is for an advocate of con-\nceptual change, one need only look at the way Wellman and col-\nleagues struggle to provide a description of children who perform\nbelow ceiling level. The trouble is that a theory-theorist is com-\npelled to say that a child who performs below-ceiling lacks com-\npetence. But then Wellman and colleagues find they need to ac-\nknowledge two kinds of incompetence. One is the incompetence\nthat prevents some children from responding systematically (i.e.,\nthey are correct about 50% of the time), and the other is the in-\ncompetence that afflicts even younger children in a way that leads\nthem to be systematically incorrect. Now, if children are re-\nsponding systematically (albeit incorrectly), then, according to the\nprinciples of theory-theory, it surely implies that they are acting\nupon a strategy. Acting upon a strategy seems to be more advanced\nwith respect to theory-theory than not acting upon a strategy;\ntherefore, a theory-theorist should predict that being correct 50%\nof the time, where there is no evidence of strategy, should devel-\nopmentally precede being correct systematically less than 50% of\nthe time, where there is evidence of (incorrect) strategy. This kind\nof U-shaped development is what Wellman et al. should have pre-\ndicted. But if they had done so, then they would have to face a dis-\nappointing refutation when looking at the results of their meta-\nanalysis.\nC&L focus on aspects of early social interactions and how these\nare vital for children to construct an understanding of the mind.\nThis well-formulated thesis deservedly takes centre stage in their\naccount, but some of the evidence pointing to the level of profi-\nciency in children\u2019s early social functioning could be interpreted\nas a sign that they are even more able than C&L recognize. The\nauthors interpret the proficiency as a precursor of later develop-\nments; they see these abilities as being necessary ingredients for\nquality social interactions, and, in turn, the ensuing interactions\nwill supply the grist from which children construct a better-devel-\noped understanding of the mind. Another possibility, though, is\nthat these are signs of an early understanding of the mind rather\nthan precursors. In other words, although C&L do an excellent job\nof challenging theory-theories that are premised on conceptual\nchange, perhaps their arguments against accounts of early com-\npetence are somewhat less elaborated.\nSimilarly, their argument against simulation theory is a lesser\nfeature of their article, being premised on the straw person of in-\ntrospectionism. Actually, simulation theory can posit that in plac-\ning yourself imaginatively into another person\u2019s (e.g., John\u2019s) per-\nspective, you orient outward from that vantage point to see how\nthe world appears (e.g., Currie & Ravenscroft 2002; Heal 1996).\nOn finding that the world looks like X, you then use an ascent rou-\ntine: I believe X. Then you step out of the imaginative mode and\ncan impute John with belief X. Clearly, this process does not com-\nfortably fit the description, \u201cintrospection.\u201d\nIn summary, C&L do an excellent job of championing an ac-\ncount of gradual development. Their account is refreshing and\ncompelling in its focus on the value of early triadic relationships.\nI think that their account would have been even more powerful if\nsome of the emphases had been slightly different, but notwith-\nstanding, they have done a great service in generating a cogent al-\nternative perspective to the mainstream.\nChallenging theory-theory accounts of social\nunderstanding: Where is the social\nconstructivist advantage?\nDerek E. Montgomery\nDepartment of Psychology, Bradley University, Peoria, IL 61625.\nmontg@bradley.edu\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) contend that correlations between\nsociolinguistic factors and theory-of-mind performance indicate that so-\ncial knowledge develops from social interactive processes. However, the-\nory-theory proponents also regard these correlations as compatible with\ntheir view of how mental concepts develop. A more fruitful distinction lies\nin the differences of both accounts in explaining how mental concepts ac-\nquire meaning.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) provide a welcome alternative to in-\ndividualist and enculturation accounts of the development of so-\ncial understanding. They argue that children\u2019s mentalistic con-\ncepts, at the center of social understanding, are neither passively\nacquired conventions nor theoretical postulates individually con-\nstructed through inference and introspection. Instead, these con-\nstructs originate in the crucible of everyday social activities and ex-\nchanges.\nTwo issues in this area stand out as fundamental: (1) to what ex-\ntent mental states are understood by young children as theoreti-\ncal entities with causal properties, and (2) the mechanisms by\nwhich children develop an understanding of the mind. Regarding\nthe second issue, C&L conclude that mentalistic knowledge de-\nvelops largely through interpersonal rather than intrapersonal\nmechanisms. Consequently, they see the correlations between so-\nciolinguistic factors and theory-of-mind task performance as\nclearly playing to the advantage of social constructivist theories\n(see, especially, sect. 4.2). This advantage, however, may be based\nto an extent on an incomplete picture of the theory-view. At one\npoint C&L write, \u201cchildren\u2019s social knowledge is based on action;\nit is not theoretical in the sense of a set of laws formed on the ba-\nsis of observation to explain the doings of other people\u201d (sect. 3,\npara. 4) (emphasis mine). This is slightly misleading since the the-\nory-view does not explain theories as forming simply from obser-\nvation. Instead, the child\u2019s social activity presents a data set which\ninfluences the development of mental concepts. Bartsch and\nWellman (1995), for instance, regard conversations about causal-\nity and about conflicting desires as being directly related to the de-\nvelopment of a theory of mind because these conversations help \nchildren to grasp that mental states are subjective causal entities.\nTheory-theory proponents, like social constructivists, regard soci-\nolinguistic influences on individual differences in theory-of-mind\nunderstanding as being complementary to their own view. Well-\nman and Gelman (1998, p. 542) claim quite plainly that children\n\u201cwho are exposed to very different amounts of mental state data\nshould acquire mental state understandings on different timeta-\nbles.\u201d\nThe first of the two fundamental issues mentioned earlier \u2013 how\nchildren regard the ontological status of mental state concepts \u2013\nis the fault line where social constructivist and theory-theory ac-\ncounts most clearly divide. Theory-theory accounts assume that\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n118 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nchildren regard mental states as private and internal sensations\nthat are causally related to, and distinct from, outward behavior\nand other mental states. The meaning of children\u2019s language about\nthe mind is derived from its referential association to these corre-\nsponding mental concepts. But this picture is essentially wrong\nfrom a social constructivist view, for a number of reasons (see\nMontgomery 2002), some of which are discussed by C&L (sects.\n2.2 and 3.2). One problem is that the theory view lacks a plausible\naccount of how a meaningful language could be developed by a\nprocess of labeling private and internal referents. For example,\nobstacles to word learning arising from the indeterminate nature\nof referential labeling are only exacerbated when the referent is\nboth internal and private, and it is unclear from the theory-theory\nposition how children would overcome such obstacles (Mont-\ngomery 2002).\nFiguring out word-referent relations for various mental states is\nnot a fundamental component of social understanding. Children\nlearn about the mind through communicative interactions, and\nlinguistic meaning follows from how mental verbs are used in dis-\ncourse rather than from the nature of a referent they are labeling.\nIndeed, Wittgenstein (1958, para. 293) suggests that the nature of\na referent can be irrelevant to linguistic use:\nSuppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \u201cbeetle.\u201d\nNo one can look into anyone else\u2019s box, and everyone says he knows\nwhat a beetle is only by looking at his beetle\u2013Here it would be quite\npossible for everyone to have something quite different in his box. One\nmight even imagine such a thing constantly changing\u2013But suppose the\nword \u201cbeetle\u201d had a use in these people\u2019s language?\u2013If so it would not\nbe used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the\nlanguage-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even\nbe empty.\nWhat communicative end is achieved by pointing, in a sense, to\nan internal sensation? How often does a child simply say, \u201cI\nwanna,\u201d where the communicative end is simply to reveal that the\nspeaker is presently experiencing the sensation of desire? One can\nimagine such an utterance as making sense only in the context of\nobtainment. The necessity of explicitly or implicitly attaching the\nverb to a complement, \u201cI want that x,\u201d underscores that the cen-\ntral communicative end of using \u201cwant\u201d is to express obtainment.\nUnderstanding the pragmatic ends toward which mental verbs\nare aimed is a critical plank in the research agenda for social con-\nstructivists. This agenda reflects the importance of studying forms\nof understanding that precede explicit comprehension indexed by\ntheory-of-mind tasks (sect. 5). Forms of social understanding es-\npecially pertinent to the prelinguistic child concern the commu-\nnicative purpose of a word rather than figuring out, through in-\nference and introspection, a preverbal mentalistic referent.\nConsequently, investigators should find that these pragmatic ends\nare evident to the prelinguistic child. For example, if \u201cwant\u201d is\nused to express obtainment, then the linguistic stimulus (\u201cthe [ac-\ntor] wants [that target]\u201d) should be associated by infants with\nscenes where an actor is pulling a target object toward herself\nrather than scenes where the actor is pushing away the target.\nVerb comprehension would be evident in this test when children\nlook longer at the scene matching the linguistic stimulus (see\nHirsh-Pasek & Golinkoff 1996). Experimental tasks of this nature\npoint the way toward illuminating the interpersonal and social fea-\ntures from which mental concepts originate. And this is a central\ngoal for social constructivist theories of social understanding.\nToward a collaborative community of minds\nKatherine Nelson\nDepartment of Developmental Psychology, City University of New York\nGraduate Center, New York, NY 10016. knelson@gc.cuny.edu\nAbstract: Three points extend the authors\u2019 comprehensive and provoca-\ntive argument: (1) The idea of \u201centering a community of minds\u201d is sug-\ngested to replace theory of mind or social understanding; (2) learning\nwords and concepts through a Wittgensteinian process often involves a pe-\nriod of \u201cuse without meaning\u201d; (3) concepts based in social interaction are\nachieved through collaborative \u2013 neither individual nor social alone \u2013 con-\nstruction.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) have done the field a great service in\nassembling the theory and evidence for a social interaction ac-\ncount of the development of social (and psychological) under-\nstanding in infancy and early childhood. In doing so, they have also\nclarified the distinction between an enculturation model of de-\nvelopment and a constructivist model based in triadic relation-\nships integrating individual and social dimensions.\nThis approach is broadly consistent with proposals and argu-\nments that I, and my students, have made (Nelson 1996; Nelson,\nin press; Nelson et al. 1998; 2000; 2003; Nelson & Shaw 2002).\nFrom this perspective, I suggest that they present an excellent\ncase but do not go far enough in a cultural-historical direction.\nThis is not to endorse a radical relativism with regard to concepts\nof mind but rather to emphasize that a child\u2019s development of such\nconcepts takes place within sociocultural-historical contexts.\nThese contexts extend beyond triadic relationships to those em-\nbracing many community members who display increasingly var-\nious mental perspectives and attitudes toward matters of concern\nto the community.\nBased on these concerns, we propose reconceptualizing \u201cac-\nquiring a theory of mind\u201d as the process of entering a community\nof minds. This construct emphasizes the notion of a gradual ap-\nproach toward the status of member of the community wherein\nmatters of minds are of interest and concern and are topics of talk.\nThese concerns involve plural minds, indicating that the problem\nfor the child, as for people in general, is not just to track and co-\nordinate the perspectives of the self and one other, but to embrace\nthe idea that people in general have different knowledge about\nand perspectives on states of the shared world.\nThe problem of integrating early social understanding and in-\nteraction with the acquisition of language is viewed by the authors\nfrom a Wittgensteinian perspective of language as activity. They\nreject the prevailing view that concepts are acquired before words\ncan be learned to express them, arguing instead that children learn\nconcepts and words at the same time. Their brief discussion gives\nlittle hint of the radical position they are taking on language learn-\ning in relation to current conceptions of the process. Nonetheless,\ntheir view accords with the evidence not only from theory of mind\nbut from evidence of word learning in natural environments, as\nthey note in citing Nelson (1997). Further, a study of the acquisi-\ntion of the words know and think by 2!s-to-4-year-olds in natural\nhome contexts was reported in Nelson and Shaw (2002; Shaw\n1999). There we showed that, consistent with the claims of the tar-\nget article, these words were used casually by parents in activity\ncontexts (playing, eating) most frequently to direct the interaction,\nwith fewer uses referring to mental states. Most of the children of\nthe ages studied knew and used the words in activity contexts con-\nsistent with the uses by their parents, but their reference to men-\ntal states was ambiguous at best, with little evidence of shared\nmeaning for these terms, despite the shared usages.\nThe evidence supports the authors\u2019 claim that words and con-\ncepts are acquired together; I would add the caution that words\nare often \u201cused without meaning\u201d by the child for a long period\n(months or years) during which the concept remains partial or elu-\nsive. The criteria for the use of mental state words are difficult for\na learner to discern for two reasons: on the one hand, the mental\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 119\nstate concept (e.g., know or think) does not exist a priori in the\nchild\u2019s mind and can only be inferred from opaque references to\nother words; and, on the other hand, the words themselves have\nmany different uses in activity contexts, only some of which refer\nto mental states. Consider the mother saying \u201cI think this one goes\nhere,\u201d as she places a puzzle piece; in what way might a child dif-\nferentiate this from the statement \u201cthis one goes here?\u201d (The am-\nbiguous meaning of think in everyday contexts and psychological\ntasks is discussed in Nelson et al. 2003.) These comments bear on\nthe authors\u2019 research agenda for the study of the development of\n\u201cshared meaning\u201d (Nelson 1985), which they point out is one of\nthe most difficult and important problems (and, I would add, most\nneglected) in developmental psychology.\nThe authors make an important point that children must as-\nsume that they live in \u201ca common, stable, external world that is the\nsame for the self and others.\u201d But as they note, this assumption is\nchallenged when through language children learn that other peo-\nple\u2019s experience is different. Coming to grips with this knowledge\nis the entry point to the community of minds and the foundation\nfor the radical change in self and consciousness that takes place\nduring the later preschool years, of which the standard theory-of-\nmind tasks have tapped one small piece. This knowledge depends\nupon evidence derived in social interactions but it does not come\nas a prepackaged concept; rather it requires knowledge construc-\ntion from accumulating pragmatic evidence. At the same time it is\na mistake, I believe, to suggest that the construction is achieved\nby the individual child, any more than to suggest that it is trans-\nmitted as a social construction from parent to child. Rather, the\nprocess may best be viewed as a collaborative construction in\nwhich the child\u2019s emerging awareness of different experiences and\ndifferent perspectives is supported, explained, and elaborated by\nparents or others through everyday discourse.\nOne of the most important kinds of such discourse is talk about\nthe past and the future \u2013 reconstructing memories of child and\nparent and forecasting coming activities. As recent work in the\nemergence of autobiographical memory has shown, more elabo-\nrative talk about the past by mothers is associated with more and\nearlier personal memories as well as better performance on the-\nory-of-mind tasks by their preschool children (Reese 2002). This\nis but one indication that theory of mind is not a separate or mod-\nular achievement, but rather, one of an integrated complex of de-\nvelopmental moves taking place during the later preschool years,\nwhich bring the child to a new level of social and psychological un-\nderstanding, preparatory to the further developments that will oc-\ncur later during middle childhood.\nChildren\u2019s understanding of mind:\nConstructivist but theory-like\nTed Ruffman\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Otago, Box 56, Dunedin, New\nZealand. tedr@psy.otago.ac.nz\nAbstract: Although in general agreement with Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s\n(C&L\u2019s) claims, I argue that (1) gradual development is better supported\nby within-task eye gaze\/verbal comparisons; (2) gradual development and\nsocial construction do not contradict the theory-theory view; (3) there is\ngood evidence for an early developing self-other distinction; and (4) the\nlanguage\u2013false belief link could be mediated by parental talk.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) argue against the notion that theory\nof mind is innate. They might concede, however, that there is\nlikely to be some innate basis for theory of mind, such as newborn\ninfants\u2019 interest in the eyes and face (Bakti et al. 2000; Johnson &\nMorton 1991). This interest means that infants\u2019 attention is fo-\ncused on a region that expresses mental states so that they are ide-\nally situated to learn about theory of mind either through their\nown initiative (e.g., by asking others questions about motivations\nfor actions; Dunn 1988), or through others\u2019 initiative (e.g., through\nparent teaching or siblings\u2019 and peers\u2019 influence in play and else-\nwhere). C&L do a good job of discussing evidence in favor of this\nlatter path and, in so doing, do the field a service.\nC&L justify their claims about gradual development using con-\ntrasting results obtained with different false belief tasks. Yet dif-\nferences in information-processing demands or in the concept ac-\ntually tapped in different tasks weaken such arguments (Perner et\nal. 1994). A stronger case for gradualism might be made on the ba-\nsis of within-task discrepancies (Clements & Perner 1994; Gar-\nnham & Perner 2001 Garnham & Ruffman 2001; Ruffman et al.\n2001b). For instance, we found that children who passed an eye-\ngaze measure of a false belief task (looking correctly when antici-\npating a story character\u2019s return), but gave an incorrect verbal pre-\ndiction, could be split into two groups (Ruffman et al. 2001a). The\nyounger such children showed complete confidence in their ver-\nbal answer, betting all counters (used to indicate the character\u2019s\npredicted location of return) on the location consistent with their\nverbal answer. In contrast, some of the older children with correct\neye gaze but incorrect verbal performance showed awareness of\nthe knowledge manifest in their eye gaze by placing at least some\ncounters on the location consistent with their eye gaze. Thus, con-\nfidence varied for children who showed identical performance on\nboth the eye-gaze and verbal measures.\nLikewise, older children who passed both the eye-gaze and ver-\nbal measures were not fully confident in their verbal answer, be-\ncause they placed at least some counters on the location that was\ninconsistent with both their eye gaze and verbal answer. In sum,\nchanges in eye gaze and confidence over time are consistent with\nthe following pattern of gradual development: (1) children fail\nboth eye-gaze and verbal measures (no understanding evident);\n(2) children pass the eye-gaze but not the verbal measure, and\nshow full confidence in their verbal response (understanding is\nimplicit); (3) children pass the eye-gaze but not the verbal mea-\nsure, and lack confidence in their verbal response (the dawning of\nconscious insight into false belief); (4) children pass both mea-\nsures but still lack full confidence in their verbal response; (5) chil-\ndren pass both measures and are confident of their verbal re-\nsponse. Increasing confidence seems to indicate a deepening\nunderstanding, perhaps because children come to understand\nbetter why the character will hold a false belief.\nAlthough I agree that theory-of-mind knowledge is constructed\nin a social context and understanding is gradual, I do not see ei-\nther conclusion as a threat to the theory-theory (TT). TT is based\non the idea that children form theories about the mind that are in\nsome ways similar to scientific theories. Scientific theories are of-\nten the result of years or decades of hard work, sometimes with\nmany scientists from different laboratories contributing. Hence,\nscientific theories, the very basis for TT, are typically constructed\nboth gradually and as the result of a community (social) effort. \nArguments against TT on these grounds are therefore erroneous.\nInstead, arguments should focus on whether the structure of chil-\ndren\u2019s understanding is theory-like (i.e., possesses the character-\nistics of a theory), and there are good reasons for thinking that this\nis at least partially true (e.g., Gopnik & Wellman 1992; Perner\n1991; Ruffman 1996; Wellman 1990).\nThere are other more minor issues. First, although C&L restrict\ntheir criticisms of TT to false belief understanding, in a broader\ncontext current versions of TT do allow for gradualism. For ex-\nample, it is a basic tenet of TT that desire understanding begins\nbefore belief understanding, which begins before belief-based de-\nsire understanding, and so on. Second, C&L argue against the\nsimulationist idea that children understand the mind using anal-\nogy, claiming that this presupposes a distinction between self and\nother. Yet, infants understand something about others\u2019 desires as\ndifferent from their own by 18 months of age (Repacholi & Gop-\nnik 1997), and mirror self-recognition indicates some rudimentary\nunderstanding of self by 3 or 4 months of age (Rochat & Striano\n2002). This allows a role for individual development of social un-\nderstanding from some time in early or late infancy at least. Fur-\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n120 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nther, there are also non-introspectionist versions of simulation the-\nory (e.g., Gordon 1992).\nFinally, the authors note the robust correlation between social\nunderstanding and language ability. One caveat is that this relation\nmight hold only for explicit performance on theory-of-mind tasks.\nPreliminary evidence indicates that language might not correlate\nwith implicit understanding (Ruffman 2000). In addition, al-\nthough some might take the language\u2013social understanding rela-\ntion as evidence for individual, nonsocial factors affecting theory-\nof-mind development, there is a way of reconciling this relation\nwith the social constructivist view. Mother mental state language\nis highly related to (1) child mental state language (e.g., Brown &\nDunn 1992; Ruffman et al. 2002); and (2) child mental state un-\nderstanding (e.g., Dunn et al. 1991b; Ruffman et al. 2002). In ad-\ndition, aspects of mother language (e.g., question asking) are re-\nlated to later aspects of children\u2019s expressive, syntactic language\nand vocabulary (Hoff-Ginsberg 1986; Hoff-Ginsberg & Shatz\n1982; Weizman & Snow 2001). It is entirely possible that the link\nbetween child language and theory of mind would be at least par-\ntially mediated through parents\u2019 linguistic input (e.g., mother lan-\nguage facilitates child general language which facilitates child the-\nory of mind).\nWittgensteinian developmental investigations\nJohn Shotter\nDepartment of Communication, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH\n03824-3586. jds@hypatia.unh.edu http:\/\/pubpages.unh.edu\/~jds\nAbstract: I criticize Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L) attempt to produce a\nWittgensteinian theory, as an alternative to work in the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d\ntradition, not because I disagree with it as theory, but because Wittgen-\nstein would be critical of any attempt to make such a use of his work. His\nconcern is with descriptions, not theories.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) want to criticize the whole \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d tradition in developmental research for its grounding in\n\u201cindividualistic processes.\u201d Instead, they want to propose an \u201cal-\nternative theory\u201d drawing on, among others, Vygotsky and Witt-\ngenstein, but especially on \u201cWittgenstein\u2019s arguments.\u201d I whole-\nheartedly endorse their turn to Wittgenstein. However, I am still\ncritical of their use of material from Wittgenstein\u2019s later philoso-\nphy. For, after all, in the Investigations he notes with respect to his\nmethods of inquiry that:\nIt was true to say our considerations could not be scientific ones . . . we\nmay not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypo-\nthetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation,\nand description alone must take its place. (Wittgenstein 1953\/1968, No.\n109).1\nHis argumentative and other kinds of remarks are aimed at a quite\ndifferent kind of investigation from those of a scientific kind.\nAlthough Wittgenstein is not critical of science as such (in its\nown, proper context), the whole scientific approach is in fact in-\nimical to the character of his investigations. His investigations are\nof a grammatical kind. Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks are thus not at all\naimed at arguing for what is in fact the case. They are to do with\n\u201cgiving prominence to distinctions which our ordinary forms of\nlanguage easily make us overlook\u201d (No.132), with drawing our at-\ntention to \u201cwhat is possible before all new discoveries and inven-\ntions\u201d (1953\/1968, No.126) \u2013 they are expressions of a concern\nwith what already lies \u201cseen but unnoticed\u201d (Garfinkel 1967, p. 36)\nin the background to all our everyday (and professional) commu-\nnicative activities. Although each of us might uniquely do our own\nthing \u2013 like taking our own particular path through a landscape \u2013\nif we are not to mislead or confuse those around us, they must be\nable to see how the path we are taking relates to those possible for\nthem; if they are to coordinate their activities with ours, they need\nto know, not what we are actually doing now, but its \u201cpoint,\u201d what\nit is aimed at in the future, where we are trying to get to; they must\nbe able to \u201cfollow\u201d us. Whereas in scientific investigations, \u201cwe\nfeel as if we [have] to penetrate phenomena,\u201d says Wittgenstein\n(1953\/1968), his grammatical investigations are \u201cdirected not to-\nwards phenomena, but, as one might say, towards the \u2018possibili-\nties\u2019 of phenomena\u201d (No.90). Hence, theories (and arguments in\ntheir support) would be necessary in these investigations only if\none were convinced that the influences shaping people\u2019s behavior\nin this grammatical fashion were so radically hidden that they\ncould be discovered only indirectly, by a process of scientific in-\nvestigation. Whereas, as Wittgenstein (1953\/1968) notes: \u201cIf it is\nasked: \u2018How do sentences manage to represent?\u2019 \u2013 the answer\nmight be: \u2018Don\u2019t you know? You certainly see it, when you use\nthem.\u2019 For nothing is concealed\u201d (No. 435). Indeed, they cannot\nbe concealed, else all around us would have to orient toward us as\naliens from another planet.\nIn other words, like C&L, Wittgenstein sees all the events of\nimportance in our teaching our children to be like ourselves (as\nwell as in our coming to an understanding of each other\u2019s unique\n\u201cinner lives\u201d) as occurring \u201cout there\u201d in the living relations be-\ntween ourselves and the others and othernesses around us. But, as\nWittgenstein (1953\/1968) realizes, the relevant events are of such\na subtle and complex kind, and \u201cit all goes by so quick\u201d (No. 435),\nthat we cannot easily get an overall view of them. A visual grasp\nallowing us to survey all their detailed interconnections at once \u2013\nhence, to know ahead of time what might follow from what \u2013\nseems, at first, impossible.\nIt is at this point, however, that Wittgenstein and C&L part\ncompany. For what C&L miss, as indeed the whole tradition of\n\u201cscientific\u201d inquiry in psychology misses, is the fact that certain so-\ncially shared influences, influences that Wittgenstein calls \u201cgram-\nmatical\u201d influences, are always ineradicably at work between us in\nour use of language. Although we easily fail to notice them be-\ncause of their socially distributed nature, it is the undeniable fact\nthat these influences are always present in our meetings with each\nother which he wants to bring to our attention. The meanings of\nthe words we use in our utterances are not, and never can be, a\nmatter of our own choosing.\nBecause the events relevant to our instructing our children and\nunderstanding each other\u2019s \u201cinner lives\u201d are not in fact radically\nhidden, Wittgenstein does not turn to theoretical claims and con-\njectures in their investigation. This is where his later philosophy\nis quite revolutionary. He introduces a whole compendium of de-\nvices \u2013 vignettes, dialogues with other \u201cvoices,\u201d arguments, dra-\nmatic scenes, metaphors and similes, striking examples, subtle\nparticularities, and so on \u2013 all aimed, not at learning \u201canything\nnew,\u201d but at \u201cunderstanding something that is already in plain\nview . . . something that we need to remind ourselves of \u201d (No.\n89).\nIn practice, then, Wittgensteinian investigations into child de-\nvelopment would not involve researchers in continually arguing\nfor theories, either in terms of evidence derived from attempts to\ntest them empirically, or conceptually in terms of whether they ad-\nequately encompass all the relevant phenomena or not. They\nwould face a different kind of task. Just as we come to know our\n\u201cway about\u201d inside a particular new house or city by taking the\ntrouble to explore connections between its unique details to gain\na sense of what leads to what, so we can gradually develop the\nsame kind of clear understanding of what is involved in our chil-\ndren coming to an understanding of others\u2019 minds. And to be con-\nfident in this way, we do not feel that we need to be able to write\nout the whole town map. For Wittgenstein wants in his investiga-\ntions \u201cto replace wild conjectures and explanations by the quiet\nweighing of linguistic facts\u201d (1981b, No. 447), thus to produce\nmerely a description of the facts that matter in the issue concerned\n\u2013 a description which, if one was initially intellectually disori-\nented,2 justifies saying to those around one (at least for the im-\nmediate, practical purposes in hand): \u201cNow I know how to go on\u201d\n(1953\/1968, No.154).

M.Siegal@sheffield.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.shef.ac.uk\/psychology\/staff\/siegal.html\nAbstract: Although Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) correctly emphasize the\nimportance of conversation in children\u2019s social understanding, they ne-\nglect several complex issues. Contrary to their assertion, the focus on men-\ntal state processing has not been misplaced, and there is a need to recog-\nnize that different aspects of social understanding are liable to undergo\ndistinctive developmental changes that vary in relation to social interac-\ntion.\nCarpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) article is a welcome addition to the\ndebate on the relation between language and theory-of-mind rea-\nsoning that has been stimulated in two recent related BBS target\narticles (Bloom 2001; Carruthers, in press). According to C&L, \u201cA\ncommon problem with the dominant perspectives of the field is\nthat each focuses on the cognitive architecture of mental state rea-\nsoning, without reflecting on the social landscape in which such\nreasoning is constructed\u201d (target article, sect. 2.2, last para.). The\nmain motivation for the social interaction approach that C&L pro-\npose is the observation that social understanding develops gradu-\nally and that research on social understanding is overly fixated on\ntheory-of-mind false belief tasks that prevent us \u201cfrom examining\nthe longer view of development\u201d (sect. 4.1, penultimate para.). In\ntheir proposal, C&L rightly highlight the central role of conversa-\ntion in development. However, they do not adequately recognize\nthat this role varies according to different aspects of social under-\nstanding, and they gloss over the fundamental distinction between\nhaving the concept of belief and differences in how specific beliefs\nare used in judging persons and situations (Scholl & Leslie 1999).\nIt is no wonder that so much attention has been fixed on the\ncore cognitive architecture of theory-of-mind (TOM) reasoning\nthat involves knowledge of how mental states such as beliefs may\nnot conform to reality. Correlations between performance on\nTOM tasks and opportunities for positive social interaction from\npeers and siblings are consistent with the notions that forms of so-\ncial interaction speed up the manifestation of TOM reasoning and\nthat having TOM may be a good thing for a wider social under-\nstanding (Peterson & Siegal 2002). However, as shown on tasks in-\nvolving predictions of the behavior of a protagonist who holds a\nfalse belief, TOM is achieved by all typically developing children\nby about four to five years of age. Modifications to the structure\nof these tasks in order to ensure that children understand the rel-\nevance and purpose of an experimenter\u2019s questions reveal com-\npetence at an earlier age (Siegal 1997), and, to a considerable ex-\ntent, the tasks themselves really amount to tests of children\u2019s\nconversational understanding (Bloom & German 2000). Early im-\nmersion in conversation with others may suffice to trigger the dis-\nplay of TOM reasoning even in three-year-olds, alerting children\nto the fact that others are repositories of information about men-\ntal states that may differ from one\u2019s own, and from reality.\nBut obstacles to conversational understanding and hence TOM\nreasoning can occur. Conditions such as deafness, autism, and\nanarthria often do not permit the child to engage even minimally\nin conversations that permit insight into the nature of mental\nstates. In all these cases, children may function quite normally or\neven excel in situations that involve reasoning about number, bi-\nology, or physics and yet have protracted difficulty on TOM tasks.\nThis pattern of results is of great significance to developmental\npsychologists and cognitive neuroscientists, as it points to the pos-\nsibility of early auditory and attentional barriers that preclude par-\nticipation in conversations and success on TOM tasks (Siegal &\nVarley 2002). The diagnosis of such barriers promises to alleviate\nthe social isolation of children with developmental disorders, in\nthe process enhancing their communication and literacy. A neu-\nrocognitive approach is fundamental to the study of this aspect of\nsocial understanding.\nUnlike the concept of belief, specific beliefs do vary in typically\ndeveloping children. In particular, children may vary in their spe-\ncific beliefs about the usefulness of false belief knowledge in an-\nswering questions about what they and others know. C&L cite a\nstudy by Varouxaki and colleagues (1999) suggesting that many\n(but not all) five-year-olds neglect to report knowledge that can be\ninferred or deny that they are ignorant despite a lack of knowl-\nedge. They interpret these responses to reflect the development\nof beliefs beyond those shown on TOM false beliefs tasks. Yet, in\nthis instance, forces of enculturation and language may either ren-\nder some children to be more modest than others in their inter-\npretation of knowledge (Lee et al. 1997), or prompt children to\ngive affirmative or other perseverative responses in situations in\nwhich they do not yet understand the purpose and relevance for\nthe task at hand (De\u00e1k et al. 2003; Fritzley & Lee 2003). Such be-\nliefs involve an altogether different aspect of social understanding\nfrom that of simple TOM reasoning \u2013 one that does need to be\nconsidered on its own merits in terms of social interaction influ-\nences.\nTherefore, whereas the expression of TOM reasoning itself can\nbe viewed in terms of a \u201cpoverty of the stimulus\u201d analysis in that,\nlike the syntax of language, only a minimal environmental input\nseems to be needed for it to emerge, social interaction can pow-\nerfully influence specific beliefs about the knowledge, emotions,\nand intentions of others. Gradually, the massive cultural differ-\nences in adult beliefs come to be reflected in children\u2019s beliefs\n(Hejmadi et al., in press; Shweder et al. 1998) \u2013 a development\nthat is distinctive from the core cognitive architecture of TOM.\nCan differences in specific beliefs be explained solely through\nthe Piagetian constructivist processes that C&L advocate? It is\nlikely that different aspects of social understanding undergo dis-\ntinctive developmental changes, much as does development in\nvarious scientific domains such as biology, cosmology, and physics\n(Siegal 2002). For example, in reasoning about food, particularly\nthe edible-inedible distinction that is close to survival, children are\nconstrained to initiate conversations in order to meet the sharply\ndefined goal of avoiding contamination. By contrast, no such con-\nversations are necessarily forthcoming on cosmological knowl-\nedge. For children to know about the shape of the earth and the\nday-night cycle may require direct cultural transmission in school.\nA constructivist account does not fully characterize either of these\nchanges. Similarly, the landscape of social understanding is huge.\nIt includes the interpretation of facial expressions and the acqui-\nsition of cultural traditions of dietary laws and other social cus-\ntoms. We await an analysis dedicated to how children\u2019s under-\nstanding of such varied aspects of the social world comes about.\nActs of judgment, not epistemic triangles\nLeslie Smith\nDepartment of Educational Research, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1\n4YL, United Kingdom. 1.smith@lancaster.ac.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.lancs.ac.uk\/staff\/erals\/\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) reanalysis of Chapman\u2019s (1999)\nepistemic triangle dealing with the coordination of interactions with phys-\nical objects and people\u2019s communication is misleadingly incomplete. An al-\nternative proposal is outlined combining the causality of action with the\nnormativity of knowledge in acts of judgment. This alternative is empiri-\ncal and developmental, with a focus on rich but neglected phenomena.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n122 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) argue for a third alternative to indi-\nvidualism and collectivism with regard to cognitive development\nin terms of Chapman\u2019s (1999) epistemic triangle (ET). This trian-\ngle has a central apex in the coordination of the remaining duality\nconsisting in interactions with physical objects and communica-\ntions with other people (target article, sect. 3). My argument is\nthat C&L\u2019s re-analysis is misleadingly incomplete. My alternative\nproposal is in terms of the human capacity to make judgments.\nWhat is an object? An answer in terms of Popperian realism\nabout three worlds, recently recast by Bereiter (2001), is instruc-\ntive: world 1 is the world of physics; world 2, the world of psy-\nchology\/sociology; and world 3, the world of epistemology. Trans-\nlated into C&L\u2019s re-analysis, an ET is the coordination of world 1\nphysical objects with minds in societies in world 2. But this is prob-\nlematic. The objects and properties of these worlds are exclusive,\nand so problems of Kuhnian incommensurability remain. First,\nphysical objects and their properties are not psychosocial. Nor are\npsychosocial objects and properties physical. This means that they\nhave in common no distinctive properties \u2013 other than causality,\nwhich is addressed below \u2013 and so C&L\u2019s re-analysis has not been\ncarried through. Second, there is worse: Whereas physical and\npsychosocial objects have causal properties, world 3 epistemic co-\nordination objects would have normative properties. Paradigm\ncases of normativity include truth-values (only truths can be\nknown) and entailments (knowing 3 1 4 5 7 entails 3 3 4 5 12).\nNor are these the only cases in the class (Smith 2002). There is\nnothing in C&L\u2019s proposal to show how this reconciliation of the\nnormative and causal properties of knowing could be carried\nthrough in the construction of true knowledge bound by necessi-\ntation. Hence, ET coordination in C&L\u2019s re-analysis names but\ndoes not explain cognitive development.\nAn alternative proposal is to regard objects intentionally as the\ncontent of acts of judgment (Smith 2002; 2003). Acts include phys-\nical and communicative interactions, and so straddle worlds 1 and\n2. These interactions occur as lawful regularities in contingencies,\ncontexts, and cultures for causal explanation in psychology\/sociol-\nogy. An important type of act is assertion and denial when an agent\nmakes a judgment. The content of a judgment is an intentional ob-\nject based on norms internal to the act. Norms include rules, ob-\nligations, and directives with a common logic (von Wright 1963).\nThey occur in all domains of knowledge and are used by individ-\nuals in societies. Acts have agents who regulate their actions in\nterms of norms \u2013 following Piaget (1965a, p. 159) \u201ca subject is al-\nways \u2018normed.\u2019\u201d The implication is not whether agents use norms,\nbut rather which norms these are and how they are used. Regula-\ntions may occur as normative facts which are \u201cimperative rules\nwhose origin is in social interactions of all kinds, and which act\ncausally, in their turn, in the context of individual interactions\u201d (Pi-\naget 1977\/1995, p. 69). Normative facts are facts and are empiri-\ncal. They are open to investigation at all developmental levels.\nCentral to this developmental epistemology (DE) is the proposal\nthat (intentional) objects are constructed in virtue of linkages be-\ntween causal facts and normative facts through uses of the capac-\nity to judge.\nHere are some examples of normativity covering both adults\nand children:\nA. Martin Luther was directed at a religious tribunal to explain\nwhy his judgment was to be trusted over that of his peers. Luther\nargued that \u201cI do not accept the authority of popes and councils,\nfor they have contradicted each other. Here I stand, I cannot do\notherwise.\u201d\nB. Galileo argued that the Ptolemaic and Copernican models\nof the universe were false and true, respectively. He was directed\nby the Church to accept that this analysis was erroneous. Asked to\nexplain why he had violated this command, Galileo insisted that\nhe had no memory of agreeing to it.\nIn examples [A] and [B], an individual is in social dispute with\npeers. This dispute is manifest in incompatible judgments, which\nare due to commitments to divergent norms in their societies.\nC. Mat was asked to add 3\/4 and 1\/4, adding numerators and\ndenominators, making 4\/8, and then through a pie chart, making\n1. Asked a normative question about how to decide which answer\nwas right, Mat replied permissively: \u201cit depends on which method\nyou are told to use\u201d (Kamii 1982).\nD. Normative commitments about number conservation were\nat work in 20% of children\u2019s incorrect responses: lengthening one\nline of counters reduced their number in that \u201cyou\u2019ve taken two\naway (and so) these two aren\u2019t there.\u201d These judgments were anal-\nogous to a normative disqualification in a game when a player is\n\u201csent off\u201d (Smith 2002).\nIn [C] and [D], children are in causal settings influencing their\nperformances. Their erroneous judgments are made by reference\nto norms which are divergent from those of their teachers.\nE. In a study of mathematical induction, young children re-\npeatedly added one counter to each of two containers, where ini-\ntially X\u2019s contents were one more than Y\u2019s. Asked a generalisation\nquestion, John replied \u201cthat (X) would be right up to the cover in\nthe sky and that (Y) would be right up to God, so then they would\nstill have to be more.\u201d This was superb reasoning by analogy\nthrough a cultural belief that God lives in Heaven on the top of\nwhich was a cover. Thus were the contents of B still more than\nthose of A, and necessarily so (Smith 2002).\nCases [A] and [B] show that normative advances are made by\nadults, and [E] that they are made by children, with [C] and [D]\ngiving testimony to the difficulties. These rich phenomena cry out\nfor explanation. Central to DE is how \u201ceach individual is led to\nthink and re-think the system of collective notions (Piaget 1977\/\n1995, p. 76). Norms are used in the initial \u201cthinking\u201d of sociocul-\ntural notions, and are developed in their \u201crethinking.\u201d Key ad-\nvances are made from causality to normativity (Piaget 1977\/1995,\np. 51), from \u201cnormative pressure\u201d to autonomous normativity (von\nWright 1963). Quite how such advances could be made remains\nindeterminate in C&L\u2019s re-analysis.\nA penny is your thoughts? Reflections on a\nWittgensteinian proposal\nBryan W. Sokola and Christopher E.

Drawing from recent work by\nKusch (1997; 1999), we argue, more specifically, that mental states are in-\nstances of \u201cartificial kinds,\u201d and so, stand between the more common clas-\nsificatory extremes of \u201cthe natural\u201d and \u201cthe social.\u201d\nMost of us, we suspect, labor under the impression that our\nthoughts are private and that even if Big Brother scrutinizes other\naspects of our lives, at least our mental lives are safe from prying\neyes. To be told otherwise \u2013 that is, to hear on good authority that\nour minds are not the private sanctuaries we have always imagined\nthem to be \u2013 would be unsettling. Although this was not our own\nfirst reaction to Carpendale & Lewis\u2019s (C&L\u2019s) broad proposal re-\ngarding the socially constructed nature of the mind, we argue here\nthat perhaps it should have been. In their treatment of the debate\nconcerning the relative contribution of social versus individual\nprocesses in development, C&L effectively \u201cout\u201d the often clos-\neted \u201cindividualistic\u201d assumptions underlying much of the present-\nday smart talk about children\u2019s understanding of mind and, in the\nbargain, usher in a set of perhaps even more radical claims. That\nis, Orwellian threats notwithstanding, we suggest something even\nmore insidious is afoot in C&L\u2019s proposal, not the least of which is\nthat our mental lives may never be quite so \u201cprivate\u201d again.\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 123\nPerhaps one of the more controversial claims that C&L make\nin this regard turns on the so-called \u201ccontents\u201d of the mind (men-\ntal states such as beliefs and intentions) and their relation to hu-\nman action. In rejecting the \u201ccausal psychological view of the\nmind\u201d that posits mental states as hidden causal \u201centities\u201d driving\nbehavior, C&L effectively claim that our language about mental\nstates has fooled us all and that, in fact, \u201cthere are no such con-\ntents.\u201d All of this seems quite hard to swallow. Nevertheless, C&L\u2019s\nposition is not without support. Although borrowing ostensibly\nfrom Wittgenstein to develop their alternative view, C&L might\njust as easily have taken a page from Dewey (see, e.g., his 1912 es-\nsay, \u201cWhat are states of mind?\u201d in Dewey 1912\/1979), who simi-\nlarly argued that \u201cpsychical\u201d states are the result of \u201cretrospec-\ntively\u201d reframing our broader activities and experiences \u2013 what he\ncalls \u201corganic reactions\u201d \u2013 and, as such, \u201care neither antecedents\nnor concomitants, in a separate realm of existence . . . but are the\nvery qualities of these reactions\u201d (Dewey 1912\/1979, p. 36). The\nupshot of this view, as expressed in more current philosophical cir-\ncles, is that \u201cour psychological classifications are constitutive of\nour mental states and events\u201d (Kusch 1997, p. 18; see also Taylor\n1985), or, phrased more polemically, that our private thoughts are\nin fact \u201csocial institutions\u201d (see Kusch 1999, pp. 321\u201368).\nMuch of what is polemical here, however, follows from a some-\nwhat different classification issue. The culprit in this case is the\ntraditional bimodal scheme of classifying things as either natural\nor social kinds. As the logic in this scheme would have it, if natural\nkinds refer to real things in the world, then, by default, social kinds\nmust refer to made-up things, or, worse, to nothing at all. Mental\nstates, in this either-or classificatory system, must either be seen\nthen to somehow cut the mind-brain at its natural joints or amount\nto mere \u201cmythical posits.\u201d C&L, as well as many others who might\notherwise agree with their assessment, are likely to be dissatisfied\nwith these two options. Thankfully, there are other, more reward-\ning ways to divide the spoils.\nIn addition to \u2013 or more precisely, in between \u2013 such natural\nand social kinds are what some philosophers have come to call\n\u201chuman\u201d (Hacking 1992) or \u201cartificial\u201d (Kusch 1997; 1999) kinds.\nTo be clear, insofar as each kind involves a self-referential com-\nponent, they are all in some sense socially constructed. Still, the\ndegree of self-referentiality differs in important ways for each. At\none end of this continuum, there are social kinds that are entirely\ncreated, sustained, and enforced by our collective actions without\nmaking any kind of reference beyond such activity. That is, they\nadmit no \u201calter-reference\u201d that, as Kusch (1997) explains, \u201crefers\naway from itself toward individuals in the physical world, individ-\nuals that exist independently of the reference\u201d (p. 17). The other\nanchor point \u2013 natural kinds like mountains and rivers \u2013 possesses\nthese independent characteristics, although even here some col-\nlective agreement is necessary in order to establish the criteria by\nwhich we meaningfully sort them. Finally, and falling in between\nthese extremes, there are artificial or human kinds that possess\nsuch an alter-reference, much like natural kinds, but that are also\nsimilar to their social counterparts in that they do not exist apart\nfrom human classifying and meaning-making activities \u2013 in fact,\nhuman activities are what bring them into physical existence in the\nfirst place.\nImportantly, then, artificial kinds are no less real than any other\nhumanly constructed or manufactured object. More central to our\npurposes here, however, is not so much what they are, but what\nthey sometimes become. That is, artificial or human kinds are\nsometimes prone to a reification process by which the construc-\ntive, or socially constituted, element is overlooked or even forgot-\nten. Kusch (1997) claims that this is the case, for instance, with\nmoney: \u201c\u2018to be money\u2019 is easily thought of as being an intrinsic,\nnon-social property of certain metal discs\u201d (p. 3). Although it\nwould hardly seem to require a philosopher to demonstrate that\nthis is a mistake, a related error is often made when it comes to\nunderstanding mental states. Like money, mental states are an in-\nstance of an artificial or human kind, and not coincidentally, are\n\u201ceasily thought of as being intrinsic, non-social properties of cer-\ntain entities called selves or minds\u201d (Kusch 1997, p. 3).\nViewing mental states as human or artificial kinds (rather than\nnatural or social), and acknowledging this tendency toward reifi-\ncation, clearly fits with the Wittgensteinian proposal on offer by\nC&L and, we argue, helps to further bridge what C&L call \u201cthe\nimpasse between individual and social perspectives on social un-\nderstanding\u201d (sect. 5, para. 1). It does so, we claim (and here is our\nmain point), without at the same time drawing us toward the en-\nculturation view that C&L rightly warn us against, and without\nwhittling away at the contribution of individual agency in the con-\nstruction of mental life.\nThe social matrix reloaded: An attachment\nperspective on Carpendale & Lewis\nHoward Steele\nAttachment Research Unit, Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology,\nUniversity College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.\nh.steele@ucl.ac.uk\nAbstract: The \u201cnew\u201d theory of Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) needs be com-\npared with existing elaborated and tested models concerning the social ori-\ngins underpinning the sense of being a person with thoughts and feelings\nin relation to others. Illustrations are provided from contemporary attach-\nment theory and research in the context of questioning the potential legacy\nof Piaget as a theorist of social relationships.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) are right to draw attention to the pri-\nmacy of social context, for our sense of self depends on the mean-\nings we take from, and give to, our closest relationships. The view\nadvanced by C&L is highly compatible with elements of attach-\nment theory (Ainsworth et al. 1978; Bowlby 1969\/2000). Bowlby\nregarded his theory as one among a range of psychoanalytic ob-\nject-relations theories (Bretherton 1998). Object-relations theo-\nries have in common the view that the primary motivation in hu-\nman life is the wish to form and maintain an enduring emotional\nrelationship with other persons (Steele & Steele 1999).\nThe complicated interactive dances that typify mother-and-\nbaby interactions are thought to facilitate or dampen the infant\u2019s\nregulatory system and brain development (Schore 2000). As Tron-\nick and Weinberg (1997) have described, \u201cmutual regulation is\none of the processes that shapes the human brain itself . . . Thus\nthe brain, like emotional experience, is jointly created\u201d (p. 73).\nWhat infants learn from these early social interactions is thought\nto be stored in their internal working models, which denote an ac-\ntive person experiencing and constructing emotions, expectations,\nmemories, and narratives (Nelson 1999).\nC&L remind us that Piaget had much to say about the funda-\nmental role of social relationships upon cognition. Piaget\u2019s dis-\ntinction between constraining and cooperative relationships cap-\ntures some of the risks and opportunities of social interaction. Yet\nthis dichotomous model leaves us a bit short, as it does not take\ninto account much of the nuances in describing the complexities\nof human relationships. Contemporary attachment theory and re-\nsearch, such as those utilising narrative analyses in children and\nadults (Main et al. 1985), pay close attention to an extensive range\nof identifiable speech patterns concerning attachment topics such\nas separation, rejection, loss, and trauma. Some of these speech\npatterns, such as profound lapses in the monitoring of speech or\nreason concerning past loss or trauma, are markers of risk factors\nfor both parent and child (Steele & Steele 2003; van IJzendoorn\n& Bakersman-Kranenburg 1996; Wallis & Steele 2001). Other of\nthese speech patterns, sharing a robust adherence to Grice\u2019s\n(1975) maxims of \u201cgood conversation,\u201d that is, truth, economy, re-\nlation, and manner, are predictors of optimal parenting and emo-\ntional well-being in children (Steele 2002).\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n124 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nThe theory of theory of mind advanced by Carpendale & Lewis\ncould thus be bolstered by incorporating the burgeoning knowl-\nedge on the nature of parent-child interactions and on individual\nvariations in dyadic emotion-regulation patterns out of which\nemerges a sense of self. Recent theorising and research on infant\ndevelopment underscores how early and in what contexts the\nsense of agency and relatedness may be observed to thrive or suf-\nfer (Koulomzin et al, 2002; Schore 1994; Stern 1985; Trevarthen\n2003; Tronick & Weinberg 1997). Further data from diverse\nsources, such as facial affect recognition (Skuse 2003), are con-\nverging to elucidate a more detailed understanding of emotional\ndevelopment.\nOne would wish to heed the sympathetic call by C&L to take\naccount of the infant\u2019s social context, dyadic, triadic, and beyond.\nHowever, the extent to which this is a new call or an old echo is\ndebatable. Consider the continued relevance of Bronfenbrenner\n(1979) or psychoanalytic object-relations theorists. Beyond\nBowlby, the words of Donald Winnicott come to mind: \u201cthere is\nno such thing as a baby.\u201d This provocative statement draws im-\nmediate attention to the baby\u2019s social context. At the same time,\nWinnicott did not underestimate the paradoxical \u2013 both individu-\nalistic and social \u2013 challenge of development. Healthy psycholog-\nical development, he urged, is likely to be secured by cultivating\nand protecting the capacity to be alone in the presence of another\n(Winnicott 1965).\nC&L find support for their approach in the findings that \u201cse-\ncure\u201d attachments appear to facilitate the development of a the-\nory of mind. In our own longitudinal attachment research (Steele\net al. 1996), we have also observed advanced theory-of-mind skills\nnot only among infants with a history of a secure attachment, but\nalso among those with a previously observed highly anxious\/fear-\nful, disorganised attachment to mother (Fonagy et al. 1997). No-\ntably, these successful predictions from infant-mother attachment\nsecurity at one year to theory-of-mind performance at age five\nwere in respect of belief-desire reasoning skills, that is, where the\nchild was required to guess correctly the feeling state of a deceived\npuppet. Attachment security did not predict belief-belief reason-\ning, that is, where the child was required to guess correctly the be-\nhaviour of a doll acting on information that is no longer valid.\nThus, the relations between infants\u2019 social experiences and the\nevolution of their theory-of-mind skills are likely to depend on the\nextent to which the context loads more on the social-emotional\nregister as opposed to the cognitive-behavioural one. Also, given\nthe similar performance we have observed in children with or-\nganised-secure and disorganised early attachments, we must not\nassume that similar phenotypic outcomes share the same type of\nsocial determinants. In one case a child may be advanced in the-\norising about emotion because one or both parents have provided\nmuch helpful talk about feelings (Dunn et al. 1991a). In another\ncase, the child may be advanced because the parent was liable to\nunpredictable and frightening behaviour such that the child\nneeded to know when to run or hide. The value of quickly detect-\ning (on the caregiver\u2019s face) the imminent rise of anger before it\nreaches its full-blown potential (when this has previously led to\nabusive behaviour from the caregiver) cannot be underestimated\n(see Pollak & Sinha 2002).\nHence, the long-term effects of early social experience are\nlikely to be manifest in the domain of emotion recognition and\nemotion understanding (Steele et al. 1999) and social cognition\n(Steele et al. 2002) and not necessarily in the broad cognitive do-\nmain, to which most theory-of-mind tasks belong. In other words,\na social constructionist account of social cognition may be highly\napt, but an individual-differences and emotion-focused account of\nmany aspects of cognition may nonetheless have continued rele-\nvance.\nThe internalization of mental state discourse\ncontributes to social understanding\nDouglas K. Symons\nPsychology Department, Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia B4P 2R6,\nCanada. doug.symons@acadiau.ca\nhttp:\/\/ace.acadiau.ca\/science\/psyc\/dsymons\/\nAbstract: Children\u2019s exposure to and participation in mental state dis-\ncourse contributes to their development of social understanding. Vygot-\nsky\u2019s mechanism of internalization is used to account for this process,\nwhich has advantages of cultural and linguistic universality. If children in-\nternalize mental state discourse, however, then their own use of mental\nstate language should be related to social understanding.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) are commended for their social con-\nstructivist account of the origins of social understanding. They\nprovide a theoretical context for recent work which has shown that\nvarious features of the early social environment of children are re-\nlated to their concurrent and later performance on false belief\ntasks, tasks which are seen as indices of theory of mind, specifi-\ncally, or social understanding, more generally. Their approach\nbrings together social and cognitive development research do-\nmains, which have proceeded largely in isolation from one another\nfor decades (with several noteworthy exceptions), very like the\nparable of the learned blind men of Hindustan examining differ-\nent parts of the social understanding elephant.\nTo support their thesis, C&L review research on the impact of\nsocial discourse. This research has shown that social understand-\ning develops relatively earlier in children exposed to mental state\nlanguage in a variety of interactional contexts that include play in-\nteractions with peers and siblings, parental discipline, and joint\nreading with parents (e.g., Meins et al. 2002; Ruffman et al. 2002).\nFurther, a series of training studies (e.g., Appleton & Reddy 1996;\nSlaughter & Gopnik 1996) lends experimental evidence to the\nclaim that exposure to discourse about mental states can enhance\nchildren\u2019s performance on false belief tasks. Issues arise which in-\nclude drawing causal inferences from longitudinal and experi-\nmental data, the external validity of false belief tasks, and the\nlargely unknown cultural specificity of links between relationship\nvariables, language, and social understanding. But the evidence is\ncompelling.\nHowever, C&L have been tentative in delineating a mechanism\nfor the developmental relation between interpersonal factors and\nsocial understanding. For example, in the concluding comments\nof this paper, C&L highlight the recent and persuasive findings of\nMeins et al. (2002) that mental state discourse of parents predicts\nchildren\u2019s false belief understanding four years later. They then\npose the question: \u201cWhat is it about the nature of these parents\u2019\ninteractions with their infants that correlates with the develop-\nment of social understanding?\u201d (target article, sect. 5, para. 4). Re-\nframed, the critical question could be: How does exposure to dis-\ncourse about mental states lead to enhanced social understanding\nin children? An answer lies in Vygotsky\u2019s mechanism of internal-\nization (see Bruner 1986; Lloyd & Fernyhough 1999; Vygotsky\n1978; 1986).\nVygotsky proposed that children internalize social speech, and\nsuch internalization socializes a child\u2019s practical intellect. Higher-\norder thought originates in the internalization of external social re-\nlationships and meanings, not by merely imitating the external in\nthe internal, but by recoding what is known about the external into\nthe internal (C&L\u2019s \u201creconstruction of knowledge,\u201d target article,\nNote 2). Applied to social understanding, mental state discourse\nleads to young children internalizing the notion that others can\nhave thoughts and emotions that differ from their own. Children\nexperience discourse about thoughts and beliefs of others and in-\ntegrate such talk into their own behavior. This is fundamental to\nself\u2013other understanding and passing false belief tasks.\nC&L actually discuss internalization earlier in the article, but it\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 125\nis not in Vygotsky\u2019s framework. Instead, Piaget and Wittgenstein\ndominate the theoretical approach of this article, even though Vy-\ngotsky, and even John Bowlby, are social constructivists who have\ndiscussed social mechanisms by which cognitive processes arise.\nPiaget was simply not a social constructivist. However, emphases\non consistencies as opposed to differences between theoretical ap-\nproaches are critical to developing coherent developmental theory,\nmuch like an exchange of information between the blind men from\nHindustan before definitively declaring what they have discovered.\nC&L conclude that \u201cresearchers studying talk about the psy-\nchological world should be concerned not just with mental state\nterms but more broadly with talk about human activity\u201d (sect. 5,\npara. 4). Data suggest that it is discourse about mental states of\nself and others that predicts social understanding, not discourse\nabout behavioral or physical attributes. Internalization must have\na cognitive basis, and this basis may relate back to Piaget\u2019s schemas\nor John Bowlby\u2019s working models of self and other. This is the\ncommon mechanism of social understanding and relationship\nprocesses that is being intensely examined in current develop-\nmental research on mental state discourse (see Symons 2004).\nAnother advantage of Vygotsky\u2019s concept of internalization is\nthat variation in language and culture are accommodated as chil-\ndren internalize what they experience in what C&L call triadic in-\nterchanges. Although there are potential variations between\ngroups in language and culture, as well as rate of acquisition of\nself\u2013other understanding, ultimately all developmentally intact\nchildren come to some understanding that others have mental\nevents that can differ from their own: what has been described as\na \u201chuman universal\u201d in self\u2013other understanding.\nBut if mental state discourse is socialized into children, is it re-\nflected in children\u2019s own language use? Researchers have been\ncareful to examine parents\u2019 use of mental state discourse in the\npresence and absence of children, but have largely ignored chil-\ndren\u2019s own discourse about mental states outside of social situa-\ntions. Children\u2019s discourse in solitary tasks may be important to \nexamine. For example, in our recent analyses of children\u2019s spon-\ntaneous discourse in Canadian and Australian samples (Symons et\nal., in press), children\u2019s use of mental state language during story-\ntelling tasks correlated as high as .62 with performance on a bat-\ntery of false belief tasks, even with general language ability con-\ntrolled. It would therefore seem appropriate that children\u2019s\nself-talk about mental states within their sociocultural context be\nincluded in any developmental model that leaps from parental\nmental state discourse to children\u2019s social understanding, which\nC&L address in their discussion of a Wittgensteinian approach to\nprivate language. Internalization can be seen as a social process,\nbut is rendered meaningless unless specific cognitive and linguis-\ntic mechanisms are added so that we can address the following:\nInternalized into what? Encoded how? Carried forward in what\nfashion? With what meaningful life impact? Answers to these\nquestions cannot be fully addressed from a single perspective.\nThe mind in the mind of the beholder:\nElucidating relational influences on early\nsocial understanding\nRoss A.

First, parent-child con-\nversation about shared experiences incorporates both implicit and explicit\ninformation about mental states that catalyzes the social construction of\nunderstanding, especially in juxtaposition with the child\u2019s direct experi-\nence. Second, emotion infuses the contexts and cognitions about social ex-\nperiences that provoke the child\u2019s constructivist efforts.\nThere have already been many responses to what Carpendale &\nLewis (C&L) are calling for in the target article: namely, greater\ntheoretical attention to the influence of social interaction on the\ndevelopment of children\u2019s social understanding. These include\nRogoff \u2019s (1990) constructivist view of the appropriation of social\ncognition in shared activity, Nelson\u2019s (1996) portrayal of the\ngrowth of the linguistically mediated mind, and the inquiry of the-\nory-of-mind researchers into social influences on psychological\nunderstanding (e.g., Lagattuta & Wellman 2002). Social develop-\nmentalists have also been concerned with the influence of social\ninteraction on mental representation. Attachment theorists, for\nexample, believe that representations (or \u201cinternal working mod-\nels\u201d) of people, self, and relationships arise from variations in at-\ntachment security and patterns of communication shared within\nsecure or insecure parent-child relationships (Bretherton & Mun-\nholland 1999).\nThe view that communication within salient relationships\nshapes early social understanding provides an opportunity to bet-\nter understand the processes by which social interaction is influ-\nential. This is one of the future directions for research identified\nby C&L, but we believe there are at least two relational influences\nthat are neglected in their analysis and that deserve greater atten-\ntion. The first concerns explicit and implicit features of conversa-\ntional discourse between parents and children. There is now an\nexpanding research literature showing that mothers\u2019 conversa-\ntional style with young offspring \u2013 especially, the extent of the\nelaborative detail, contextual information, and provocative ques-\ntions mothers provide \u2013 contributes not only to the sophistication\nof children\u2019s event representation but also to their understanding\nof emotions, conscience development, autobiographical memory,\nand other features of social cognitive growth (Thompson 1998).\nMaternal conversational references to people\u2019s feelings and emo-\ntions are also related to young children\u2019s emotion and moral un-\nderstanding (Thompson et al. 2003).\nMothers in secure attachment relationships are more elabora-\ntive in conversational discourse (and also make more frequent ref-\nerences to emotion), and this may be one reason for the working\nmodels their offspring develop (Thompson 2000). Elaborative dis-\ncourse about shared experiences in the context of a generally\nwarm, secure relationship may enhance children\u2019s receptiveness\nto the understanding of psychological states embedded within\nsuch conversations. For this reason, we are exploring in current\nresearch the association between maternal \u201cmind-mindedness\u201d\n(Meins 1999) and elaborative discourse to elucidate avenues by\nwhich attachment security and social cognitive development may\nbe related. This work also offers avenues for clarifying the nature\nand development of the \u201cinternal working models\u201d of interest to\nattachment researchers (Thompson & Raikes 2003).\nDiscourse quality in parent-child conversation is important not\nonly for the reasons identified by C&L (e.g., as a means for be-\ncoming aware of beliefs; as a way of representing false belief in\ncontrast to reality), but also as a means for understanding the so-\ncial constructivist processes within relationships that they empha-\nsize. In conversation about shared experiences, the secondary rep-\nresentations provided in parental discourse are juxtaposed with\nthe child\u2019s direct representations through experience; and the con-\nvergence, dissonance, complementarity, and differential focus of\nthese representations are a rich basis for the constructivist\nprocesses described by C&L, because parents and children often\nperceive shared experiences differently (Levine et al. 1999).\nThis work therefore significantly expands the authors\u2019 propos-\nals for how relationships influence social-cognitive growth in early\nchildhood, and suggests also that relational quality as well as vari-\nations in the nature of parent-child discourse \u2013 including nonver-\nbal features of parent-child conversations, such as affect, gesture,\nand context \u2013 contribute significantly to representations of men-\ntal and psychological functioning of young children. Early parent-\nchild conversations are important not only because they offer\nguidance to young children concerning the relations between be-\nhavior and people\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, but because\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n126 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nthey also include implicit and explicit moral judgments, inten-\ntionality attributions, and even characterological ascriptions to the\nchild that are likely to contribute significantly to the construction\nof social and psychological understanding.\nFurthermore, the context of shared conversation is important.\nContrary to C&L, conflict as well as comity is a salient conversa-\ntional context because nothing focuses a young child\u2019s attention on\ndiffering mental states than the realization that conflict with an-\nother must be managed. Thus, maternal verbal conflict-resolution\nstrategies in shared conversation during disputes, such as mother\u2019s\nuse of justifications, references to emotions, and limited use of\nthreatening or intimidating tactics, predict young children\u2019s emo-\ntional and moral development months later (Laible & Thompson\n2002).\nThe second feature of social interaction highlighted by these\nfindings \u2013 and largely neglected by C&L \u2013 is emotion. Young chil-\ndren\u2019s efforts to manage and comprehend their feelings and the\nemotions of others are significant catalysts to understanding men-\ntal states, and such experiences constitute salient interactional\ncontexts in which mental state differences are the focus of shared\nobservation and communication. This is true from the inaugura-\ntion of the \u201cepistemic triangle\u201d in infancy, as emotions contribute\nto self-other differentiation and contexts of shared reference and\njoint attention (such as in social referencing). Moreover, emotion\norganizes early understanding of mental states by connecting\nemotion to broader emergent representations of relationships,\nself-referent beliefs, and comprehension of behavioral expecta-\ntions. Emotion is important, therefore, because it is not only think-\ning about emotion (which has been the focus of much theory-of-\nmind research) but thinking with emotion about self and others\nthat stimulates early social understanding. This is one reason why\nin our studies (see Thompson et al. 2003) as well as others (La-\ngattuta & Wellman 2002), relational influences are especially ap-\nparent in children\u2019s conversations about and comprehension of\nnegative emotional events. Constraint and cooperation are both\nconceptually provocative experiences for young children.\nIn sum, emotion is often salient to the activity that contributes\nto social understanding. In early childhood, moreover, conversa-\ntion about these experiences with an adult who elaborates the\nchild\u2019s direct experience, in the context of a warm, secure rela-\ntionship, provides a rich basis for the child\u2019s construction of social\nunderstanding. This social constructionist view provides provoca-\ntive opportunities to integrate the focus on normative develop-\nment, emphasized by students of early conceptual growth, with\nthe focus on individual differences emphasized by students of\nearly sociopersonality development.\nIn defense of enculturation\nPenelope G. Vinden\nHiatt School of Psychology, Clark University, Worcester, MA 01610-1477.\npvinden@clarku.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.clarku.edu\/departments\/psychology\/faculty\/vinden.cfm\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) view enculturation as the internal-\nization of cultural concepts given in social interactions. They claim that en-\nculturation implies relativism and fails to take into account both the con-\nstructive activity of the child and the gradual nature of development. Their\nview is contrasted with the notion of the child as both enculturated and\nenculturing throughout the course of development.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) argue against a social construction\nview, which they see as equivalent to enculturation, or the inter-\nnalization of cultural concepts given in social interactions. I would\nclaim, however, that enculturation need not be seen as a simply\npassive process of information transmission (cf. Vinden 2000).\nFurthermore, if viewed as an interactive process, enculturation is\na term that nicely captures the unique role that culture plays in\nhuman social development; a role that includes but extends be-\nyond triadic interactions.\nThe narrowness of C&L\u2019s conception of enculturation is re-\nflected in their discussion of its supposed implications. In the first\nplace, they maintain that enculturation is the importing of \u201cready-\nmade\u201d concepts from the social world to the individual, which im-\nplies cultural relativism (cf. target article, sect. 3.2, para. 7). En-\nculturation need not involve, however, either a unidirectional\nsocial transmission model or radical relativism.\nAt first glance, enculturation may seem to be a one-way street.\nA newborn child seems little able to engage in even the most\nrudimentary of dyadic interactions. He or she is fed, moved,\nchanged, spoken to (or not) according to the wishes of the care-\ntaker. Crying may or may not influence these interactions \u2013 a re-\nsponsive caretaker may attune him- or herself to the child, but the\nchild is as yet unable to attune to the other as other. As C&L point\nout, young children may not initially understand the social impli-\ncations of interactions and only gradually move from \u201cbehavioris-\ntic\u201d interactions (crying brings food) to \u201cbehavioristic\/mentalistic\u201d\ninteractions (crying makes Mom do what I want) to \u201cmentalistic\u201d\ninteractions (crying makes Mom think I\u2019m hungry). But the child,\nwhether intentionally or not, certainly influences the actions of the\ncaregiver from the moment of birth onwards. A child who comes\ninto the world kicking and screaming, and whose behavior con-\ntinues, for whatever reason, to be characterized by kicking and\nscreaming in the months and perhaps years to follow, is certainly\nenculturating her caregiver in a manner quite different from the\nnewborn who is all cooing and contentment.\nMy suspicion is that there are cycles of directionality in the en-\nculturation process. At some points in the child\u2019s life, encultura-\ntion may be primarily a learning of the criteria for competent in-\nteractions by the novice from the expert. This is what the authors\nseem to focus on. Though they want to emphasize the active role\nof the child, they still seem to fall into talk that would imply that\nmuch of the learning is of norms (situational\/relational norms, not\nideational norms) already established \u201cout there\u201d in the world:\n\u201cchildren . . . learn the appropriate contexts for the use of various\nwords referring to the psychological world\u201d (sect. 3.2, para. 3);\nthey \u201clearn the criteria for words to talk about human activity and\nthen can reflect on the psychological world\u201d (sect. 3.2, para. 9).\nWhat C&L fail to emphasize, however, is that at times learning\nmay be primarily in the direction of child to other, as the other is\ncalled upon to adjust to the new abilities or demands of the child\nby relating in a new way. Enculturation is always by the child of\nothers as well as of the child by others.\nEnculturation need not invoke a relativism that leaves one un-\nable to say that some forms of knowledge are \u201cbetter, more com-\nplete, or more adequate\u201d than others (sect 2.1, para. 10). As C&L\nclearly point out, there are likely basic universal shared practices\nthat are common to all human experience. But it is also well doc-\numented that differences exist among cultures at quite a funda-\nmental level \u2013 for example, the degree to which the individual or\nthe group is emphasized (cf. Lillard 1998; Vinden & Astington\n2000). If a cultural group puts a low priority on talking about in-\nner states, or does not conceive of them as particularly personal\nand individual, then the public criteria for learning about thoughts\nand emotions might be quite different from the typical public cri-\nteria in a culture where people are seen as individuals with dis-\ncrete, personal, private inner lives. Hence, although understand-\ning and getting along with other human beings may be universal,\nwhat that means and the criterial situations for learning about get-\nting along can vary widely from culture to culture. And if the cri-\nteria vary, why would the understanding constructed from those\nsituations not vary also?\nCertain kinds of criterial situations may provide knowledge that\nis better or more adequate for living in those situations. There is\na certain kind of circularity here, but not, I think, a vicious sort.\nFor example, when living on a small atoll in the Pacific Ocean,\nwhere one\u2019s friends, neighbors, and relatives are all the same peo-\nple, individuality might not be as adaptive as communality. The\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 127\nsame might be true for those living on an African-American inner-\ncity \u201catoll\u201d within a predominantly Caucasian middle-class city.\nOnce an emphasis on group rather than individual processes is es-\ntablished, the situations in which that understanding is fostered\nbecome criterial and could tend to self-perpetuation. But what\nmay work well on an atoll may not work elsewhere \u2013 what is bet-\nter, more complete, or more adequate in one social or cultural sit-\nuation may not be so in another.\nThat being said, there is still no reason per se why cultural vari-\nability need go hand-in-hand with a view of passive transmission\nof mental concepts to the child. The child is influential not only in\nconstructing his or her understanding but also in defining the con-\ntext in which learning takes place, and even the content of what\nshould be learned. Furthermore, individuals are not the only\nthings that interact in relationship \u2013 groups, societies, cultures all\nrelate and influence one another.\nIn short, although I applaud C&L\u2019s efforts to make social inter-\naction the center of development, rather than merely an add-on\nexplanatory variable, I feel they are not radical enough. Seeing tri-\nadic interactions as the epicenter of development does not neces-\nsitate relegating cultural variability to the sidelines. Children\u2019s de-\nvelopment is not constructive only in the sense that they gradually\ncobble together cultural criteria for language use and other be-\nhaviors. It is also constructive because part of their development\nconsists in constructing the criteria for themselves and for others.\nWithout this active transforming of the world, caregivers would\nnever adapt to their children, peers would never learn how to\npacify or enrage their playmates, and societal and cultural change\nwould not exist.\nInterpretation based on richness of\nexperience: Theory development from \na social-constructivist perspective\nArlene S.

We provide examples of similar claims in research on emotion per-\nception, pretense understanding, autobiographical memory, and event\nknowledge. Identification of common elements from such socio-cultural\nperspectives may lead to greater theoretical integration and provide a new\nframework for exploring human development.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) propose that the development of \nunderstanding of others\u2019 minds grows not from a kernel of knowl-\nedge already in a child\u2019s brain, nor from the assumption of envi-\nronmental-cultural norms, but through dynamic, ongoing inter-\nactions with caregivers and the physical world. This is a welcome\nstep into the already burgeoning literature in a number of areas\n\u2013 motor development, cognitive development, socio-emotional\ndevelopment \u2013 spurred by theories such as dynamic systems, the\necological approach, and contextual approaches. The view that\nchildren\u2019s understanding of mind is part of the larger process of\nsocial understanding and is constructed through social interac-\ntion is consistent with other models that attribute a critical role\nto the process of social interaction in development. We provide\nexamples of similar claims in research on the development of the\nperception of emotion, pretense understanding, autobiographi-\ncal memory, and event knowledge. These lines of research pro-\nvide support for the notion that richness of experience, not rich\ninterpretation, provides an interpretive framework for under-\nstanding children\u2019s emerging understanding. They also indicate\nthat social interaction is fundamental to human development\nacross a wide range of social, emotional, cognitive, and perceptual\nphenomena.\nC&L argue that development of an understanding of others\u2019\nminds (intentions, beliefs, emotions) is not \u201call or none.\u201d Research\non infants\u2019 understanding of emotional expressions supports this\ncontention. Whether an infant perceives an emotional expression\nand responds to it depends on the age of the infant, the expression\nthat is being enacted, the task by which the experimenter mea-\nsures perception, the definition of perception (detection, dis-\ncrimination, recognition, understanding), and the context in\nwhich the expression is encountered (Walker-Andrews 1997). In-\nfants as young as three months show intermodal matching for\ntheir mothers\u2019 happy and sad facial-vocal expressions, but not for\nexpressions posed by a female stranger (Kahana-Kalman &\nWalker-Andrews 2001) Similarly, infants show intermodal match-\ning for fathers\u2019 happy and sad facial-vocal expressions only when\nthey have highly involved fathers (Montague & Walker-Andrews\n2002). Lest one think that this is because infants are merely ex-\nposed to maternal expressions more than paternal expressions, re-\nfer to research by Dunn and colleagues (Dunn et al. 1991a; 1991b)\nthat illustrates the importance of the family context and interac-\ntions in the perception of emotion by children.\nChildren\u2019s understanding of the pretense of others also devel-\nops gradually (Harris 1994b). For example, Walker-Andrews and\nKahana-Kalman (1999) concluded in a study of pretense under-\nstanding that \u201ctoddlers move from appreciating that an adult part-\nner initiated a game of pretend to understanding the pretend stip-\nulations of the adult, and finally, at 24 months, to using that\nunderstanding to enter into collaborative pretend play\u201d (p. 531).\nIn particular, some 15- and 18-month-olds imitated the experi-\nmenter\u2019s pretend transformations as a way to coordinate actions\nwith the experimenter. To borrow from the description of chil-\ndren\u2019s involvement in deception, the toddlers entered into the\npretense \u201cwith only partial understanding and such experience is\nthe context for learning\u201d (target article, sect. 4.1, para. 6) about\nsuch mental states as pretense and deception. The comprehension\nof another\u2019s pretense emerges early in the second year, but the\nability to tailor one\u2019s pretend actions in that interaction is not\ndemonstrated until later.\nC&L propose that conversation provides a context for children\nto interpret and talk about the mental world. Conversation also\nprovides a context for thinking and talking about past events, as\ndemonstrated by extensive research on the development of young\nchildren\u2019s autobiographic memory (Reese 2002). Although chil-\ndren\u2019s contributions to conversations at two to three years consist\nsolely of short answers to specific questions, over time, children\ndevelop the narrative skills to discuss the past more fully and to\neventually construct independent memory narratives (Haden et\nal. 1997; Hudson 1990; Nelson 1993). Through conversation chil-\ndren learn how to remember, not what to remember; they do not\nsimply repeat what was told to them but acquire memory and nar-\nrative skills (Hudson 1990). This distinction is similar to C&L\u2019s ar-\ngument that through social interaction, children do not simply\nadopt socially available knowledge, but rather, construct their own\nunderstandings within the interactional context. Research has also\nshown that individual differences in parents\u2019 reminiscing style af-\nfect children\u2019s independent narrative ability in later years, indi-\ncating that characteristics of the dyadic relationship influence chil-\ndren\u2019s autobiographic memory development (Reese et al. 1993).\nFinally, research on the development of event knowledge illus-\ntrates the tension between performance factors and underlying\ncompetence discussed by C&L. A large body of research has\nshown that children\u2019s generalized event representations (GERs)\nprovide a cognitive context for the development of memory, plan-\nning, narrative, inferential reasoning, and temporal understanding\n(Nelson 1986). Before children display these skills in novel, de-\ncontextualized, experimental tasks, they accurately use temporal\nlanguage, draw appropriate inferences, construct future plans, re-\nmember stories and events, and construct story narratives when\nreasoning about familiar events in meaningful interactive contexts\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n128 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\n(Hudson 1993; Hudson et al. 1995). This reprises the issue of the\nrole of partial understanding in development. Researchers exam-\nining the role of event knowledge in children\u2019s cognitive develop-\nment have argued that knowledge displayed within familiar con-\ntexts provides the foundation for later, more generalized skill. Just\nas a lexicon for talking about the mental world provides children\nwith a cognitive resource for reflection and interpretation, chil-\ndren\u2019s GERs allow initial \u201cunderstanding-in-action\u201d to be consol-\nidated through reflection on internal event representations.\nWe propose that a more social-interactional approach is needed\nat this stage of social-constructivist theory development. All of\nthese lines of research stem from approaches emphasizing the so-\ncial-cultural embeddedness of development. Although specific\nmechanisms may vary, they constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d of social con-\nstructivist approaches. Our single concern with the C&L model is\nthat it may not be adequately inclusive. The tendency to label as\n\u201cpassive enculturation\u201d approaches that vary in small degrees\nfrom the C&L position may limit the potential for integration\nacross research domains. Rather than focusing on differences\nfrom an individualist framework, joint attention on common prin-\nciples and collaborative interactions may be more fruitful for the-\nory development.\nWhat infants know about intentional action\nand how they might come to know it\nCamille Wilson-Brune and Amanda L. Woodward\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.\ncamillew@uchicago.edu woodward@uchicago.edu\nhttp:\/\/www.ccp.uchicago.edu\/faculty\/Amanda_Woodward\/\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) propose that social knowledge is\nconstructed from triadic interactions. This account generates testable pre-\ndictions concerning social knowledge in infancy. Current evidence is not\nentirely consistent with these predictions. Infants possess action knowl-\nedge before they engage in triadic interactions, and triadic use of an ac-\ntion does not always precede knowledge about the action.\nCarpendale & Lewis (C&L) propose an ontogenetic relation be-\ntween interacting and knowing: By participating in increasingly\nwell-organized social exchanges, children come to construct a\ntheory of mind. Evaluating this proposal requires measuring both\nsocial actions and social knowledge. Given this requirement,\nC&L\u2019s review reveals striking gaps in the empirical record. The in-\nfant work presented concerns assessments of social behavior, al-\nthough underlying social cognition (or lack thereof) is only in-\nferred. The studies of older children concern social cognition as\nassessed in interview studies, with factors such as parenting style\nstanding as proxies for children\u2019s social interactions. A full account\nmust address both gaps. We will focus on the first.\nC&L propose that triadic interactions, in which the infant and\ncaretaker mutually coordinate attention on the same object, are\nnecessary for the construction of social knowledge and, ultimately,\na theory of mind. Because infants do not engage in triadic inter-\nactions until the end of the first year of life, this account predicts\nthat they have not yet begun to construct social knowledge. C&L\nfurther predict that, once triadic interactions are established, so-\ncial behavior relevant to a particular aspect of intentional knowl-\nedge will emerge before the knowledge itself does. Recent evi-\ndence from our laboratory and others\u2019 speaks to these predictions.\nThis evidence indicates that triadic interactions and social knowl-\nedge do not always travel together in ontogeny.\nAspects of social knowledge are present months before infants\nengage in triadic interactions. Infants represent actions not as\npurely physical motions through space but rather as directed at\nobjects or states of affairs (Baldwin et al. 2001; Csibra et al. 2003;\nGergely et al. 1995; Moore 1999; Woodward 1998; Phillips et al.\n2002). To illustrate, in one study (Woodward 1998), 6-month-old\ninfants viewed a person reaching for and grasping an object. Fol-\nlowing habituation, infants demonstrated a stronger novelty re-\nsponse to test events that disrupted the relation between agent\nand object than to test events that maintained this relation while\nvarying the spatial properties of the reach. Infants did not respond\nin this way when viewing inanimate objects that touched or\ngrasped other objects, or when viewing manual contact that ap-\npeared purposeless to adults (Woodward 1999). Therefore, in-\nfants\u2019 social knowledge reflects a foundational aspect of mature\nconceptions of intentional action \u2013 namely, that certain human ac-\ntions are object-directed (see Barresi & Moore 1996).\nThis work highlights infants\u2019 knowledge about instrumental ac-\ntions. C&L focus on interactions in which infant and caregiver\nshare attention, as expressed by looking and pointing. But these\nare just a subset of the actions that adults view as intentional. In-\ndeed, many investigators have elucidated infants\u2019 developing abil-\nity to extract the goals behind observed instrumental actions\n(Gergely et al. 2002; Meltzoff 1995; Wenner & Bauer 1999; Wood-\nward & Sommerville 2000). Our recent findings are consistent\nwith the thesis that experience contributes to infants\u2019 construction\nof social knowledge; however, in this case what matters appears to\nbe infants\u2019 experience of acting on objects rather than of partici-\npating in triadic interactions (Sommerville & Woodward, in press).\nRecent studies also elucidate infants\u2019 knowledge about the ac-\ntions involved in triadic exchanges. Infants begin to follow gaze\nduring the first year of life, but, as many have noted, this observa-\ntion alone does not tell us whether infants understand the \u201clook-\ning at\u201d relation (e.g., Barresi & Moore 1996). Several studies in-\ndicate that by 12 months, infants encode looking and pointing as\nrelational (Moore 1999; Phillips et al. 2002; Woodward 2003;\nWoodward & Guajardo 2002). Prior to 12 months, infants respond\nto gaze by orienting their own attention but seem not to encode\nthe relation between looker and object (Woodward 2003). This\npattern of findings is consistent with C&L\u2019s proposal. Infants be-\ngin to understand the looking relation after several months of re-\nsponding appropriately to shifts in others\u2019 gaze.\nHowever, the emergence of pointing suggests that this pattern\ndoes not hold in all cases. Knowledge about pointing is evident be-\nfore infants employ it robustly in triadic interactions. Infants\u2019 first\npoints are often described as indexing their own attention rather\nthan being communicative (Bates et al. 1979; Schaffer 1984a). It\nis not until 12 to 15 months of age that infants produce points in\na clearly communicative manner and follow others\u2019 points to their\ndistant referents (Bakeman & Adamson 1986; Carpenter et al.\n1998; Desrochers et al. 1995). Furthermore, infants do not use\ncontextual cues to determine when to point until around their sec-\nond birthday (e.g., Dunham et al. 2000; Moore & D\u2019Entremont\n2001). Consistent with the thesis that experience is related to\nknowledge, at 10 months, those infants who produce object-di-\nrected (but not clearly communicative) points understand ob-\nserved points as relational (Woodward & Guajardo 2002). There-\nfore, although experience may contribute to infants\u2019 knowledge\nabout pointing, the evidence suggests that the relevant experience\nis not triadic in nature.\nTo conclude, recent findings indicate that although triadic in-\nteractions may be one source of infants\u2019 social knowledge, they are\nnot the sole source. Infants are sensitive to the object-directed-\nness of instrumental actions well before the onset of triadic inter-\nactions and come to understand certain actions before using them\nin triadic interaction. In addition to interaction, firsthand agentive\nexperience is a likely contributor to this system of knowledge. That\nis, there seems to be more than one route into social understand-\ning. This may account for the fact that all normally developing\nchildren construct a theory of mind despite the existence of broad\ncross-cultural variation in the nature of early triadic interactions\nand habits of talk about the mind (Lillard 1998; Rogoff et al. 1993).\nCommentary\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 129\nConstructing an understanding of mind \nwith peers\nStephanie Zerwas, Geetha Balaraman, and Celia Brownell\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.\nstz1@pitt.edu grb22@pitt.edu brownell@pitt.edu\nAbstract: Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) stress the importance of social in-\nteraction for social understanding, but focus on the adult-child relation-\nship. In the present commentary, we discuss the development of social un-\nderstanding within early peer relationships. We argue that peer interaction\nstretches the limits of early social understanding, thereby providing both\nunique challenges and unique opportunities for constructing an under-\nstanding of others\u2019 minds.\nIn their target article, Carpendale & Lewis (C&L) assert that chil-\ndren construct social understanding through interactions with\nothers and that social knowledge is fundamentally based on action\nwithin these relationships. In particular, they emphasize that early\ntriadic interaction facilitates the development of language and that\nconversation about the mental world, in turn, permits children to\nperceive, understand, and reflect on their own and others\u2019 mental\nand emotional states. We share the authors\u2019 view that social inter-\naction contributes to social understanding. However, we believe\nthat the authors have limited their argument by focusing so heav-\nily on early parent-child interaction. In the present commentary\nwe discuss the contributions of early peer interaction to social skill\nand social understanding. Although C&L acknowledge the \u201csib-\nling effect\u201d (Perner et al. 1994) and the role of cooperative inter-\nactions with age-mates for children\u2019s use of mental state terms\n(Brown et al. 1996), they do not discuss how interactions with sib-\nlings and peers differ from adult-child interactions, and the possi-\nbly unique role played by interactions with other children in gen-\nerating early social understanding.\nC&L argue that \u201cchildren\u2019s initial, fragile social understanding\u201d\nis \u201cat first evident when supported by social interaction\u201d (sect. 4.1,\npara. 9, emphasis ours) and that \u201cchildren gradually construct so-\ncial understanding through the regularities they experience in in-\nteracting with others\u201d (sect. 3, para. 1, emphasis ours). In their\nformulation, the young child\u2019s adult partner supports social en-\ngagement through regular and routinized interaction and, in that\ncontext, interprets and labels the child\u2019s mental states. From our\nview, this type of cooperative interaction, although probably ini-\ntially necessary for children\u2019s nascent social understanding, can\ntake children only so far toward a more general understanding of\nmind. In routinized interactions, especially with a sensitive adult\nwho has complex mental state understanding, the child has little\nneed to predict the partner\u2019s behavior or to communicate his own\nmental states. When social partners\u2019 behavior is predictable, and\nwhen routines and communication are either built-in or highly\nlearned, having to read minds is not necessary.\nPeer interaction, in contrast, provides a social context in which\nchildren\u2019s partners are unpredictable and their goals, intentions,\nand desires are often difficult to read even for sensitive, mind-\nminded mothers. The challenges of interacting with peers may re-\nquire that children be explicit about communicating their inten-\ntions. Consistent with this notion, Smiley (2001) found that\ntoddlers were more likely to state their future intentions in peer\nplay than in mother-child interactions. Furthermore, peer inter-\naction also provides children their only opportunity for true coop-\neration, defined by both Piaget (1932\/1965b) and C&L as \u201cinter-\naction among equals.\u201d Thus, peers pose both unique challenges\nand unique opportunities for the growth of early social under-\nstanding.\nChildren are capable of establishing and maintaining positive\npeer interactions in play and in cooperative problem-solving by\nthe end of their second year (Brownell et al. 2003; Eckerman et\nal. 1989; Howes et al. 1989). Without a way to \u201cmake sense\u201d of\nother children\u2019s behavior, the toddler cannot anticipate a peer\u2019s\nbehavior, hence cannot behave in a coordinated, reciprocal, ac-\ncommodating manner, and peers\u2019 behavior will simply be in-\nscrutable for the very young child. The fact that children can im-\nitate one another by 14 to 18 months (Eckerman et al. 1989;\nHanna & Meltzoff 1993) but cannot cooperate with one another\nuntil 24 months or later (Brownell & Carriger 1990; Brownell et\nal. 2003; Tomasello et al. 1993) suggests that their early under-\nstanding of others\u2019 minds, as constructed in adult-child relation-\nships, remains too incomplete to serve interaction more generally.\nMoreover, the social understanding that develops in the context of\nearly peer play is not a function of mental state talk between peers.\nNonverbal interaction may be even more important for children\u2019s\ndeveloping social understanding of one another. Mutual imitation,\nfor example, may provide the first means for children to begin\nmaking sense of their peers\u2019 behavior and may be the grist for gen-\nerating initial understanding of peers\u2019 intentions (Eckerman et al.\n1989).\nSocial understanding not only arises in situations of peer coop-\neration and positive interaction around a shared theme, goal, or\ndesire, but may also be adaptive and necessary in instances of com-\npetition. It is notable that possession struggles and conflicts, which\nconstitute a relatively high proportion of early peer interactions\n(Brownell & Brown 1992; Hay & Ross 1982), are unique to child-\nchild interactions. When one toddler approaches another, the\nchild must figure out whether the peer intends to hug her, play\nwith her, take away her favorite toy, or something else. Caregivers\nare not always available to assist children in interpreting and un-\nderstanding such situations, and even when they are present, they\noften prefer to let children figure it out on their own. Hence, chil-\ndren may be motivated to learn how to read other children\u2019s men-\ntal states and to understand the relations between mental states\nand behavior so that they can effectively negotiate ambiguous,\nemotionally charged situations. Such interactions may also pro-\nvide children insight into the nature of their own emotional expe-\nriences (Balaraman et al. 2003).\nWe do not mean to suggest that parent-child relationships and\npeer relationships are unconnected, however. Young toddlers who\nare more responsive to an adult\u2019s bids for joint attention are also\nbetter at coordinating their actions with a peer toward a common\ngoal (Brownell et al. 2003). Toddlers who have more positive ex-\nperiences in play with their mothers engage in more complex so-\ncial play with their peers (Howes & Stewart 1987; Zerwas &\nBrownell 2003). Thus, the social understanding children construct\nduring interaction with adults is also brought to bear on their in-\nteractions with peers. Nevertheless, establishing and maintaining\npositive interactions with peer partners pose distinctive challenges\nboth affectively and cognitively. Peer interaction thereby stretches\nthe limits of children\u2019s early social understanding and makes\nunique contributions to its development.\nAuthors\u2019 Response\nConstructing understanding, with feeling\nJeremy I.

We reject\nsuggestions that we offer nothing new to traditional theories of de-\nvelopment or recent \u201csocial\u201d accounts of \u201ctheory of mind.\u201d Sec-\nond, we take the point that there are grounds for improving our\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n130 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\naccount of dyadic interaction in infancy but reject claims that we\nhave not sufficiently accounted for how we incorporate the no-\ntions of criteria and structure into the theory. Third, we accept that\nthe epistemic triangle, as defined, would benefit from an affective\ndimension and such a formulation could be used to describe the\ndynamic of developmental change from infancy to beyond early\nchildhood. We still feel that the combination of Wittgenstein, Vy-\ngotsky, and Piaget remains as an antidote to the flaws in current\n\u201ctheories of mind\u201d approaches to social understanding.\nThe squirrel does not infer by induction that it is\ngoing to need stores next winter as well.\n\u2014Wittgenstein, On Certainty (1969, para. 287)\nFor us the starting issue was that the dominant theories in\nthe area of the development of children\u2019s social under-\nstanding, referred to as \u201cchildren\u2019s theories of mind,\u201d view\nthe problem that children must solve as inferring the pres-\nence of and learning about unobservable inner mental\nstates. Wittgenstein\u2019s rejection of the idea of \u201csquirrel cog-\nnition\u201d summarizes our suspicions about an account of early\nhuman development that imputes the child with a social un-\nderstanding that develops in an individualistic manner not\ngrounded in shared practices. The dominant accounts ini-\ntially made little reference to the child\u2019s experiences except\nto examine the young theoretician\u2019s database, although they\nare now accommodating to research on children\u2019s social ex-\nperience. Hence, we turned to Wittgenstein and the very\ntraditions within developmental psychology that the theory\nof mind tradition set itself up against. The target article was\nan attempt to pull together these diverse views in order to\nget a child\u2019s eye view of development. This we assume to be\nmuch more piecemeal and embedded in experience than\nrecent accounts have suggested.\nWe have been both moved and inspired by the commen-\ntaries and strongly recommend them as worthwhile read-\ning. In writing this Response, we feel we could have done\nmore justice to about half the number and apologize to\nthose who we simply mention; but we were restricted to\nabout 200 words per commentary. So we have concentrated\non some much more than others \u2013 and mainly those we felt\nchallenged us more (they tended to be those we thought\nwere closest to us in theoretical terms). The response is di-\nvided into three sections: general criticisms, specific con-\ncerns with our theory, and the many elegant extensions that\nwere recommended. Far from criticizing our plea to make\ntheories of the development of social understanding more\nsocially embedded, many of these commentaries empha-\nsize just how rich the child\u2019s social experiences are and how\nwe did not go far enough.\nR1. Is our theory needed? Or should it be\nupended?\nThere are three ways in which the commentators question\nwhether our position is necessary: One group, who are dis-\ncussed in the first subsection that follows, takes the long\nview and suggests that our approach is hardly new in its dis-\ntillation of fine theories. The second part deals with a dif-\nferent view \u2013 that we have been trumped by recent socially\nembedded criticisms of theory of mind \u2013 and we discuss\nthis in section R1.2. Finally, in sections R1.3 and R1.4 we\nreflect on the view that traditional accounts of theory of\nmind worked just nicely without the critical analysis that we\noffer, particularly the need for a Wittgensteinian analysis.\nR1.1. Piaget and Vygotsky \u2013 again?\nWe are pleased that many of our commentators agree that\na social perspective has long been neglected in the area\nknown as children\u2019s theories of mind. And, like them, we\nbelieve it is needed. But have we simply recycled classic de-\nvelopmental theories in this article? Certainly, Louren\u00e7o\nassumed that we were making more grandiose claims about\nproposing a completely new theory than we were.1 We\nmake it clear that we draw on Piagetian and Vygotskyian\ntheory \u2013 ideas with extensive histories. Thus, we agree with\nChesnokova that the ideas we are working with have long\nhistories, and we thank her for adding Luria\u2019s name to the\nlist of theorists we rely on. Sokol & Lalonde also bring in\nDewey and this list could be extended considerably to in-\nclude the influence of Janet, Baldwin, Pierce, Werner, B\u00fch-\nler, and G. H. Mead. Tracing the extensive histories of the\nideas in question was beyond the scope of our target article\nand we refer readers to excellent sources such as Overton\n(1998a) and Valsiner (1998).\nSo, is it \u201cnew\u201d to draw upon Piaget and Vygotsky?\nLouren\u00e7o asserts that \u201cwithout additional specifications\nand elaborations\u201d Piaget and Vygotsky\u2019s theories \u201cdo not\nneed to be repeated.\u201d Ironically, he has felt it necessary to\ncontribute to the task of repeating these ideas to fend off\ncommon misinterpretations embedded in the scientific\nfolklore (Louren\u00e7o & Machado 1996). In our defense, there\nis nothing we know of in Piaget and Vygotsky\u2019s work about\nissues equivalent to Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of criteria. This\nwe draw from Chapman\u2019s (1987a; Carpendale et al. 1996)\nwork on operational thinking and extend to children\u2019s rea-\nsoning about social matters. As many commentators point\nout, this is no straightforward matter and we turn to some\nof these issues below.\nPerhaps implicitly criticizing our reliance on Piaget,\nSymons and Fernyhough suggest that we should instead\nrely more on Vygotsky. Vygotskian ideas, as Chesnokova\nrightly points out, are embedded in our approach.2 Symons\nargues that we are tentative in outlining a mechanism of de-\nvelopment and suggests we should employ Vygotsky\u2019s idea\nof internalization. However, this mechanism is far from\nfully specified, and Vygotsky himself acknowledged that \u201cas\nyet the barest outline of this process is known\u201d (1978, p. 57).\nClearly, Vygotsky\u2019s theory needs to be fleshed out, as Chap-\nman (1991) and Fernyhough (see also Fernyhough 1996)\nhave done to some extent. Thus, we maintain that there is\nno necessary incompatibility between Piaget\u2019s views and\nVygotsky\u2019s views on social relations and we feel that the for-\nmer\u2019s account of internalization is required to flesh out the\nideas of the latter.\nR1.2. Are we merely repeating current social\nconstructivist theories?\nA few commentators imply that our ideas echo recent ones\nwithin the theory of mind tradition (see explicit statements\nin Astington and Steele). Astington questions how new\nour approach is and groups us with a family of similar the-\norists, some of whom are also commentators (Astington,\nFernyhough, Montgomery, Nelson; see also Harris, in\npress). Astington is correct in pointing out areas of agree-\nment between our article and the theorists she lists. We\ncould also go further than Astington in identifying theorists\nwith whom we have much in common concerning infant de-\nvelopment, such as Hobson, and Barresi & Moore. We\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 131\ncite most of these authors in the text and acknowledge how\nthey have influenced our ideas. However, we suggest both\nthat there are clear differences between the authors she\ngroups together and that we differ from all of them. For\nsome, the differences relate to matters of detail. For exam-\nple, Montgomery and Fernyhough still need an account of\nsocial development in infancy in order, among other rea-\nsons, to overcome the problems Bickhard points out in his\ncommentary concerning the development of prelinguistic\nnormativity. We agree with Astington and Howe that Judy\nDunn\u2019s work has been seminal in establishing a need for a\nsocially embedded model of mental state understanding\nand our theory is premised upon that assumption. It is work\nlike Dunn\u2019s that stimulates a need for a detailed theoretical\naccount and we suggest that a constructivist one provides\nan answer.\nMany of the theorists cited by Astington differ from us\nover how children learn the meaning of mental verbs. For\nexample, she groups us with Garfield et al. (2001). Here, if\nwe stick to the general issue of the importance of language\nand social interaction, we could say we are in agreement.\nIndeed, Garfield et al. coordinated a great deal of evidence\nand advanced convincing arguments. However, we differ\non the very starting problem that children have to solve.\nThat is, are mental states some sort of hidden inner object\nthat must be inferred? Like Montgomery but unlike oth-\ners in Astington\u2019s list, we suggest that this is the wrong way\nof setting up the problem that children must solve. Bick-\nhard and Sokol & Lalonde also present complementary\npositions in their commentaries. Astington acknowledges\nthat there are differences, but considers these to be only de-\ntails. However, this is where the devil is, and discussion of\nsuch differences is essential for further theoretical devel-\nopment.\nThere is an interesting implication in the fact that\nLouren\u00e7o and Chesnokova say the theory is old and they\nmean it is Piagetian and Vygotskian, whereas Astington\nsays it is old but she means it is the same as a family of the-\nories including Nelson (1996), Harris (in press), and her-\nself. But someone has to be wrong, or not quite right. Un-\nless we are mistaken, the theorists listed by Astington either\ndo not mention Piaget or explicitly distance themselves\nfrom Piaget\u2019s fundamental ideas (see, e.g., Perner & Ast-\nington 1992). It seems that everyone recognizes something\nof themselves in our approach. Alternatively, it could be\nthat they might be happy with the interpretation of Piaget\nthat we draw on.\nLouren\u00e7o further argues that our proposal is vague and\nad hoc, and that a weakness of our approach is that we can\nexplain anything by it. It is clear from the commentaries\nthat this is a weakness shared by all the other theories in this\narea. German & Leslie argue that modular theory has no\ndifficulty accommodating to the evidence that social inter-\naction is important in social development. In fact, they now\nallow the inclusion of domain general processes in their\nmodel, which indicates that they are moving away from\nmost other modular positions, apparently towards theory\ntheory. Gerrans (2002, p. 308, original emphasis) has sug-\ngested that \u201con any view of modularity, the operation of a\nmodule cannot be affected by central, domain general pro-\ncesses.\u201d Similarly, several commentators (Bartsch & Estes,\nMontgomery and Ruffman) argue that theory-theory can\nalso deal with the evidence. The commentaries arguing that\nthe modular and theory theory accounts explain the data\nthat we present only discuss the data on social relationships,\nnotably sibling interactions. We concede that these per-\nspectives can be accommodated to such evidence, but, as\nnoted in our target article (sect. 2.2), as the range of data\nwidens this task becomes more difficult and their theories\nbecome more diffuse. Indeed it is getting quite hard to dis-\ntinguish between these two positions:\n\u201ctheory of mind\u201d is described as having an innate and possibly\nmodular basis, not as consisting in its entirety as either innate\nor as a module. (German & Leslie, original emphasis)\nIt is certainly true that there are some innately given kinds of\npsychological knowledge. However, it seems to us that these are\nmost likely to be \u201cstarting state\u201d theories. (Gopnik & Wellman\n1992, p. 168)\nLouren\u00e7o also claims that we have not conclusively\nruled out the other theories in this area. First, even if we\nhad devoted our target article to criticizing current theories\n(and more criticism is provided by commentators Hobson,\nMitchell, and Montgomery), we still could not conclu-\nsively rule them out. They are not single theories, but rather\nfamilies of theories sharing core assumptions or research\nprograms in Lakatos\u2019s (1970) sense. Research programs\ncannot be simply ruled out because a modified theory based\non the same core assumptions can always be proposed. Sec-\nond, our criticism based on Wittgenstein is more far-reach-\ning because it reveals flaws in an assumption on which all\nthe dominant theories are based (Chapman 1987a; Mont-\ngomery 1997; 2002). The aim of the next subsection is to\nshow that such an approach is a firm conceptual foundation\non which to build (see sect. 2.2 in our target article).\nR1.3. Is theory theory an adequate explanation? \nOr do we need Wittgenstein?\nRuffman\u2019s final paragraph presents some interesting at-\ntempts to reconcile the theory and constructivist perspec-\ntives, but does not bridge a fundamental difference be-\ntween our approach and the theory theory in how children\nlearn the meaning of mental state terms. Montgomery\nmakes the point that the sibling data can be used to support\nthe positions we criticize, but then goes on to elaborate on\nthe argument from Wittgenstein. He writes that according\nto the theory theory (and, we would add, simulation and\nmodular theories) children learn the meaning of mental\nstate terms by means of a referential association with pri-\nvate inner sensations that are causally related to but distinct\nfrom outward behavior. Section 3.2 of the target article pre-\nsents arguments like Montgomery\u2019s current and recent\nwork (see Montgomery 1997; 2002). Bickhard\u2019s discussion\nof the frame problem adds to the argument that beliefs are\nnot objects that can be learned about through introspec-\ntion. Bickhard points out that in the case of talk about be-\nliefs there \u201cis nothing unitary, no coherent kind of matter of\nfact, for belief talk to refer to.\u201d The frame problem shows\nthat there is no limit to the number of beliefs a person could\nbe said to have.\nSokol & Lalonde point out that Dewey\u2019s ideas about\nmental states are consistent with Wittgenstein\u2019s later work.\nOne misunderstanding that might be possible after reading\ntheir commentary that we want to guard against is the claim\nthat we are denying the existence of mental processes. It\nmight appear that Wittgenstein denies mental states, and\ntherefore he must be a behaviorist. If Wittgenstein denies\nthat a sensation is a mental object, it may appear that he is\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n132 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nsaying there is no sensation, in which case the child\u2019s un-\nderstanding of mind amounts to no more than learning to\ntalk about mental states through enculturation. But that is\nnot what he intended: \u201cAnd now it looks as if we had denied\nmental processes. And naturally we don\u2019t want to deny\nthem\u201d (Wittgenstein 1968, para. 308). \u201cTo deny the mental\nprocess would mean to deny the remembering; to deny that\nanyone ever remembers anything\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953\/\n1968, para. 306). What Wittgenstein did reject was labeling\nmental processes as private objects in the same way we la-\nbel physical objects. Thus, his argument is about how our\nlanguage makes us think about psychological processes, not\na denial of psychological processes.\nOur use of Wittgensteinian ideas is questioned by Shot-\nter, although we note that he does not challenge our philo-\nsophical interpretation. Shotter argues that Wittgenstein\nshould not be taken piecemeal and that he was concerned\nwith description not theory. To deal with this criticism we\nneed to apply Wittgenstein\u2019s own method to be clear about\nboth the task he took on and the sense in which he used the\nterm \u201ctheory.\u201d In the paragraph cited by Shotter, Wittgen-\nstein (1953\/1968, para. 109) goes on to explain why his con-\nsiderations could not be scientific ones. It is because the\nproblems he addresses are not empirical but philosophical,\nfocusing exclusively on the meaning of words, due to us be-\ning misled by the workings of our language: \u201cPhilosophy is\na battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by\nmeans of language\u201d (para. 109). His analysis leads to the\nconclusion that words are torn free from their natural con-\ntext, and meanings of words only exist in particular contexts.\nIt is this crucial insight that we draw upon in our analysis.\nUsing this idea is not incompatible with the study of human\ndevelopment. Indeed, there are two reasons why we feel\njustified in using it in our developmental account. First, we\nshould begin from the foundation that Wittgenstein has\ncleared. In Wittgenstein\u2019s words: \u201cI am not interested in\nconstructing a building, so much as in having a perspicuous\nview of the foundations of possible buildings\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1980, p. 7e). This does not preclude what is built on these\nfoundations. Indeed, secondly, after he disposes of our\ncommon misconceptions about how children learn the\nmeaning of words for inner sensations, Wittgenstein goes\non to answer his own question of how children learn the\nmeaning of such words by writing: \u201cHere is one possibil-\nity . . .\u201d (1953\/1968, para. 244). It is just this possibility that\nwe are exploring in our theory. This runs counter to Shot-\nter\u2019s relativistic stance on Wittgenstein, but we are agreed\nthat these ideas provide a damning critique of the dominant\ntheories of theories of mind.\nWe should consider why Wittgenstein felt that theory\nwas not appropriate for the task he took on. Given his con-\ncern that words only have meaning in particular contexts, a\ngeneral set of rules for mechanistically deriving meaning\n(i.e., a theory in one sense of the term) cannot be formu-\nlated, because meaning is not mechanistic (see Goldberg\n1991). Instead, meaning is indexical. It depends on the lo-\ncation of words or utterances in sequences of interaction\n(Budwig; see also Suchman 1987; Turnbull 2003). This is-\nsue can be illuminated by considering a parallel debate be-\ntween Searle (1992) and Schegloff (1992) on whether a the-\nory of conversation is possible. Searle concluded that a\ntheory of conversation is not possible. In one sense of the\nterm \u201ctheory\u201d Searle (1992) is correct. That is, it is not pos-\nsible to form a theory that would allow us to derive mean-\nings of utterances in conversation because such meanings\nalways depend upon their location in particular sequences\nof interaction. However, this does not stop us from learning\na great deal about the process of conveying meaning in con-\nversation, as shown by Schegloff (1992). The indexical na-\nture of meaning pointed out by Budwig is part of a general\nproblem of the development of knowledge that leads us to\na constructivist view, including how children learn the\nmeanings of mental state terms.\nR1.4. Is modular theory an adequate explanation?\nReductionism and constructivism revisited\nGerman & Leslie object to our presentation of the mod-\nular view, and they especially object to our contrast between\nthis and the position that humans have evolved the capac-\nity to develop an understanding of mind. Instead, they in-\nsist that it is the latter position that they endorse as the mod-\nular position. In fact, the statement that humans have\nevolved the capacity to develop social understanding is just\na logical necessity. Within that general agreement there is\nobviously a lot of controversy. In support of their case, Ger-\nman & Leslie cite a study by Hughes and Cutting (1999) re-\nporting a strong heritable component (60%) to false belief\nperformance. However, in their more recent research with\na sample 10 times the size, Hughes et al. (in press) found a\nmuch weaker relation: only 16% genetic influences com-\npared with 63% environmental influences (see also De-\nneault et al. 2003). Furthermore, such findings tell us noth-\ning about the process through which any genetic influences\nmight work.\nGerman & Leslie quote Roth and Leslie (1998), who\nstate that the theory of mind mechanism is essential because\nit \u201callows the young brain to attend to . . . mental states de-\nspite the fact that such states cannot be seen, heard, felt, or\notherwise sensed\u201d (emphasis in original). They go on to state\nthat what is critical is the ability to attend to mental state\nproperties such as pretending and believing. However, what\nit could possibly mean for the child to attend to believing is\nfar from clear in their account. The Wittgensteinian argu-\nment above and in section 3.2 of our target article shows that\nthey have gone wrong from the very start because the ques-\ntion they address is misconceived \u2013 mental states cannot\nsimply be \u201cattended to\u201d (see also Bickhard, Montgomery,\nSokol & Lalonde). The fact that German & Leslie do not\nrecognize our position as a proposal implies that their start-\ning assumptions differ so much from ours that they have a\ndifferent notion of just what a proposal should look like. Yet\nwe call their starting assumptions into question.\nThus, there is an even more fundamental problem with\nGerman & Leslie\u2019s account that is shared by two other\ncommentaries. Their approach is reductionistic in their talk\nabout how the \u201cyoung brain attends\u201d to mental states, and\nthis reduces attending to neural activity (Brown 2003).\nCraig & Barrett take a stronger position than German &\nLeslie in assuming that folk psychology is innate, due to\n\u201ccertain devices inside us\u201d (Millikan 1993, p. 63). Further-\nmore, they claim that it is a job for neuroscientists to look\nfor those devices. Gerrans takes a similar tack, treating\nWittgenstein\u2019s investigations as irrelevant for development\npsychologists who, he states, should really be concerned\nwith discovering the \u201cneurocognitive processes\u201d involved in\nconcept formation. In our view, a Wittgensteinian analysis\nundermines the leap that these commentators make so ef-\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 133\nfortlessly between neural activity and psychological con-\nstructs.\nNeurological research will not address the questions we\nare concerned with because it does not deal with meaning.\nCraig & Barrett exemplify the problems inherent in a re-\nductionist approach in their claim that the only thing they\nare certain of is that knowledge of the world is embodied in\none\u2019s particular configuration of synaptic connections. Why\nstop here? Wouldn\u2019t it be even more certain to go to the\nlevel of the distribution of neurotransmitters at the synapse\nor at an even finer biochemical level? Synaptic connections\nmay contain information, in some sense of the word, but not\nknowledge. A train schedule has information but no knowl-\nedge; a person is required to read and interpret the sched-\nule. Therefore, a homunculus is required (Heil 1981;\nKenny 1991; M\u00fcller et al. 1998a; 1998b). In addition to fo-\ncusing on neurocognitive mechanisms, Gerrans also takes\na computational approach. This is fundamentally flawed\nbecause there is no way to deal with meaning. \u201cComputers\ndon\u2019t understand anything, nor do they care\u201d (Hobson\n2002, p. xiv). The problem for this sort of approach is to \u201cex-\nplain the transition from causal processes in the brain to\nconscious, meaningful experience\u201d (M\u00fcller et al. 1998a,\npp. 229\u201330. For similar arguments, see Hacker 1991).\nIt is for this reason that we are committed to the alterna-\ntive, constructive approach to development. Siegal asks\nwhether the constructive view can account for the devel-\nopment of specific beliefs, distinguishing these from \u201ccore\ncognitive architecture.\u201d Exactly the same process is in-\nvolved. From a constructive view of knowledge develop-\nment, concepts cannot simply be transmitted ready-made.\nRather, understanding of all types must be constructed by\nthe child in interaction. Nevertheless, our constructive ap-\nproach is consistent with evolutionary theory. We take the\npoint from Eddy, Fonagy, and German & Leslie that it\nis important to consider what biological adaptations allow\nhumans to develop social interaction and social under-\nstanding. These make language, human history, and culture\npossible (Elias 1978). In addressing this problem, we follow\nTomasello (1999b) in being particularly cautious about at-\ntributing innate knowledge to infants. The problem is not\nsimply solved by saying that infants are born being able to\nattend to mental states. It is still necessary to explain how\nan ability evolved. Furthermore, if it is possible for it to have\nevolved we need an explanation for why it could not de-\nvelop in individual ontogeny (Bickhard 2004).\nEddy considers a possible interpretation of Povinelli and\nEddy\u2019s (1996) findings that although chimpanzees follow\ngaze they do not demonstrate an understanding of the psy-\nchological implications of seeing. He notes the possibility\nthat the chimpanzees may have failed their task because\nthey were responding to humans and not to other chim-\npanzees. Although we agree with Eddy that it is an unlikely\nexplanation, the possibility remains to be evaluated. How-\never, it is evident that we humans do not restrict mentalis-\ntic interpretations to our own species, because we had \nassumed that when chimpanzees follow gaze they also un-\nderstand the psychological implications of seeing just as we\ndo. If it were found that chimpanzees did restrict their so-\ncial understanding to members of their own species it\nwould indicate a difference in their social understanding\ncompared to that of humans. In any case, there is additional\nevidence that a range of increasingly complex forms of gaze\nfollowing can be observed in human infants.\nR2. Should the theory be amended?\nAlthough some of the commentators discussed in section\nR1 are keen to maintain that traditional theoretical posi-\ntions remain intact in the face of the evidence we summa-\nrize, a second group examined the internal consistency of\nour theory, and we address these here. In the three parts of\nthis section we consider claims from a number of angles\nthat the notion of the epistemic triangle does not fit very\nwell in describing infants\u2019 social skills (R2.1), that Wittgen-\nstein\u2019s notion of criteria exposes us to a diversity of possible\nproblems (R2.2), and that we have not specified the nature\nof the structures or processes that the child develops (R2.3).\nAll these analyses call for amendments to the original the-\nsis.\nR2.1. The development of the epistemic-relational\ntriangle in infancy: Getting dyadic\nDo we give a full enough explanation of infant develop-\nment? For a start, as Bickhard argues, Wittgenstein did\nnot account for prelanguage normativity. We agree.\nWittgenstein said that the use of words is built onto previ-\nous shared practices but he did not explain how these prac-\ntices arise except to say that the child is \u201ctrained.\u201d Such\npractices are where Wittgenstein said he hit bedrock and\nhis spade was turned. But this is where Piaget kept on dig-\nging (M\u00fcller 1999). And for this part of our argument we\nrely on Piagetian theory in accounting for development in\ninfancy.\nIt is Chapman\u2019s (1991) notion of the epistemic triangle\nthat helps us build a social dimension in a Piagetian ap-\nproach to infancy. Does this formulation stand up to the\ncritical scrutiny of our commentators? Ruffman is con-\ncerned because he suggests that there is evidence of an\nearly developing self-other distinction. He cites two exam-\nples. One is at 18 months of age when we too would obvi-\nously expect a self-other distinction to have developed. He\nalso refers to evidence from research with infants from 3 to\n4 months of age. The study cited by Ruffman (Rochat &\nStriano 2002) was with 4- to 5- and 8- to 9-month-old in-\nfants. There was evidence of longer looking time in the\nother condition compared to the self condition, as well as\ndevelopment between the two age groups. However,\nRochat and Striano acknowledged that there were a num-\nber of differences between the conditions in addition to self\nversus other that make firm conclusions difficult. And in-\nfants\u2019 ability to respond differentially tells us little about\nwhether they have any understanding of a self-other dis-\ntinction (M\u00fcller & Carpendale, 2004). However, in a de-\nvelopmental account such as ours, early forms of self-other\nknowledge must be looked for. Therefore, we agree with\nRochat and Striano (2002, p. 44) that these abilities emerg-\ning at 4 to 5 months form the \u201cfoundation from which chil-\ndren can eventually develop the conceptual and explicit\nsense of themselves expressed by the middle of the second\nyear.\u201d\nThe problems to be solved in infant social development\nare set up very well and in different ways by Barresi &\nMoore and Hobson. Our position is very similar to that of\nBarresi & Moore. We agree that social understanding de-\nvelops out of engagement with others \u2013 that it is \u201calways out\nof shared activity with others that advances in understand-\ning of mental phenomena are first made.\u201d We recognize\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n134 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nthat two individuals have independent perspectives of the\nobject and of each other; but there remains one issue of\npossible disagreement between us and this concerns the na-\nture and development of representation. Barresi & Moore\u2019s\nuse of terms like \u201creflective representation\u201d and \u201cintegrat-\ning information\u201d may buy into a theory of representation\nwhich is at odds with the activity-based view that we hold\n(M\u00fcller et al. 1998b). However, as we discuss below, their\ncomments on emotional relations and the \u201cwe\u201d-ness of in-\nteraction are well-taken.\nHobson holds that theories of infant social development\nmust account for primitive modes of experiencing of self\nand other in interpersonal relations. One of his questions\nconcerns how infants are aware of persons as having a men-\ntal as well as a physical dimension. This remark could be\nmisunderstood because Hobson is usually at pains to deny\nthat the initial task for the infant is to discern mental states\n(Hobson 1994). Rather, he is usually interested in account-\ning for the formation of the self-other distinction and, like\nus, he locates this in the dynamic of interaction between the\ninfant and the other. We are also cautious about the solu-\ntion Hobson proposes. He suggests that \u201chumans are\nequipped with a propensity for forms of role-taking that\nboth link an individual infant or child or adult with some-\none else, and at the same time register the distinctiveness\nof self and other.\u201d It is important to know exactly what is\nmeant here because the term \u201crole-taking\u201d would usually\nbe interpreted at a much higher level (Flavell et al. 1968).\nWe assumed that Hobson (and he has confirmed this via e-\nmail) does not intend it in this way and his commentary goes\non to describe this process as: \u201cchildren are moved by the\nattitudes of others.\u201d Perhaps all that is really needed is a\npropensity to engage with other people (helped by infants\u2019\npredisposition to be interested in others\u2019 eyes and faces, as\nRuffman suggests) and the ability to respond to their re-\nactions, initially without any clear idea of the other as sep-\narate from the self.\nHobson is critical of our focus on action and instead sug-\ngests that what is needed in addition is an emphasis on emo-\ntional engagement. We agree with the addition. Further-\nmore, he asks us how communication is grounded. From\nour perspective it is embedded in interaction. This starts\nwith a pattern in which the infant emits affective signals that\nare punctuated in protoconversation by the adult (see, e.g.,\nKaye 1982; Schaffer 1977). Gradually the infant\u2019s contribu-\ntion to the interaction becomes more active, in terms of re-\nsponding to others on this affective level. At first this is\ndyadic, without reference to objects (Chapman 1991). The\ngoal is just the reaction, there is no communication outside\nthat. Research over the past thirty years has suggested that\ninfants treat humans differently from objects because they\nreact contingently (Watson 1972), and caregivers are intent\non extending the length of bouts of affective engagement\nwith very young infants (Stern 1977). We contend that a\nmuch leaner interpretation can be used instead of the one\noffered by Hobson. Indeed, we agree with his later sugges-\ntion regarding the ability to be \u201cmoved\u201d by another\u2019s atti-\ntudes. This develops apace within dyadic interaction within\nthe first year and makes possible the development of triadic\ninteraction (subject-interlocutor\u2013object) and the capacity\nfor symbolic thinking.\nIn the target article we place much stress on the epis-\ntemic triangle as a basis for development. We need to clar-\nify its relation with triadic interaction following Meins\u2019s\ncomments. What is referred to is interaction with other\npeople about aspects of the world. It makes no difference\nif there are several other people involved \u2013 this would also\nbe triadic in our sense. The point is to distinguish this form\nof interaction from forms of interaction in early infancy\nthat are dyadic in that they involve the infant just interact-\ning with the physical world or with a person. However, it is\na misinterpretation by Wilson-Brune & Woodward to\nassume that we believe that the development of infant\u2019s so-\ncial knowledge only begins with triadic interaction. This\nwould be a completely non-developmental account. The\nquestion of how infants develop the capacity for triadic in-\nteraction from dyadic interaction must be addressed (this\nissue was discussed in sect. 3.1 in our target article). Lee-\nkam points out that children with either autism or Wil-\nliams syndrome have difficulties with dyadic interaction but\nfor different reasons. Children with autism focus on dyadic\ninteraction with objects, whereas children with Williams\nsyndrome are more dyadically engaged with people. Both\ngroups have difficulty with triadic interaction. By Leekam\u2019s\nanalysis the problems identified in these syndromes are\nmuch more basic than at the \u201ctheory of mind\u201d level (Lee-\nkam, in press).\nWilson-Brune & Woodward suggest that our approach\ndoes not hold in the case of the emergence of pointing be-\ncause infants\u2019 first pointing gestures may not be commu-\nnicative but may instead index their own attention. Al-\nthough there is much controversy about the origins of\npointing, the evidence is consistent with our approach. We\nexpect (as do Moore & Corkum 1994) that infants first get\ninto forms of interaction for other reasons and then learn\nwithin such interaction. For example, we would expect that\ninfants\u2019 first pointing gestures would not be clearly social.\nAs Wilson-Brune & Woodward suggest (and also as stated\nin our article), there are clear developments in the se-\nquence of pointing skills.\nThus, the lesson that we learn from our commentators in\nthis section is that there is much to be gleaned from dyadic\ninteraction in the first year of life, particularly in the level\nof affective engagement that the infant develops. We accept\nthese ideas into our theory with thanks, especially as these\ncommentaries remind us of the insights of parent-infant in-\nteraction studies in the 1970s and of Reddy\u2019s (e.g., 1991;\n2003) impassioned critique of theory theory based in part\non her rich descriptions of infant-parent interaction in the\nfirst year.\nR2.2. Language and criteria\nThere are a number of points raised about our use of\nWittgenstein\u2019s notion of criteria. These range from ques-\ntions regarding word learning to the suggestion that the no-\ntion of criteria implies an enculturation position that we\nclaimed to be avoiding.\nThe word learning problem raised by Miller & M\u00fcller\nis that there are limitless possible meanings of new words,\nwhether they are object labels or verbs. Thus, they suggest\nthat the problems with word learning as correlating words\nwith things also apply to correlating words with events.\nThey also state that learning mental state terms would be\nparticularly difficult because psychological states are not di-\nrectly observable. To solve these problems they offer an in-\nteresting, if traditional, solution \u2013 that because the problem\nof mapping word to world is so intractable children may use\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 135\nthe structure of language as a cue to mental verb meaning.\nWe do not deny that sentence structure is important in the\nchild\u2019s language development in general and perhaps in\nlearning the meaning of mental verbs. However, we have\nthree responses to Miller & M\u00fcller\u2019s analysis. First, in sec-\ntion 3.2 of our target article and here above we rehearse the\nWittgensteinian argument that learning meanings of men-\ntal verbs is not a matter of naming inner unobservable states\n(Montgomery 2002), a view that is supported in a number\nof commentaries (Montgomery, Bickhard, Sokol &\nLalonde).\nSecond, we disagree with the assumptions about lan-\nguage that lead to setting up the problem of word learning\nin this way. Miller & M\u00fcller appear to assume the con-\nstraints approach to the problem of word learning, accord-\ning to which word learning involves creating and eliminat-\ning many possible hypotheses about how new words map\nonto the world (Tomasello 2001). The solution they suggest\nis that syntactic bootstrapping constrains the number of\npossible hypotheses. In contrast to this slightly disembed-\nded solution, we endorse the social pragmatic approach to\nword learning described by Tomasello (2001), according to\nwhich children are \u201cengaged in social interactions in which\nthey are attempting to understand and interpret adult com-\nmunicative intentions \u2013 so as to make sense of the current\nsituation (Nelson 1985)\u201d (Tomasello 2001, p. 113). We view\nmeaning as related to the purposes for which words are\nused within interaction (Budwig et al. 2000; Turnbull &\nCarpendale 1999a). Third, the structure of language may\nbe important in children\u2019s learning the meaning of mental\nverbs, but the leap from syntax to meaning is still magical.3\nIt is not clear how the word learning problem is resolved by\nchanging it to the unpacking of syntax (which is what Miller\n& M\u00fcller seem to imply by referring to the \u201clanguage struc-\nture\u201d) and mapping onto mental states. We endorse Bud-\nwig\u2019s suggestion to study constructions as the unit of analy-\nsis, because such a usage-based unit provides a far more\ncredible route into meaning through language (Budwig\n1998; Tomasello 1998).\nOur suggestion to look beyond mental state terms to\nstudy talk about human activity is reflected on by Symons.\nHe argues that we should not only look at parent-child dis-\ncourse as a window on the process by which children ac-\nquire such terms, but we should also consider the child\u2019s\nspontaneous utterances during \u201csolitary\u201d tasks. This is an in-\nteresting idea that is compatible with our approach, and\nSymons considers this as an important potential route into\nan understanding of the child\u2019s internal mental states. From\nthe unpublished study that he recounts, children\u2019s \u201cdis-\ncourse in solitary tasks\u201d correlates highly with false belief\nunderstanding. Without more information about the task\nand whether the children were asked to narrate while per-\nforming it, we find it hard to judge whether Symons has\nidentified a mechanism in keeping with Vygotsky\u2019s ideas.\nWe agree that all children\u2019s activities, whether in discussion\nwith adults, peers, siblings, or \u201calone,\u201d are useful markers\nof their constructions of mental state terms. Like Symons,\nour aim is to bridge the gap between parents\u2019\/others\u2019 men-\ntal state discourse and the child\u2019s constructions. However,\nwe would add that it is not sufficient to correlate the fre-\nquency of mental state terms with test data. We agree with\nBudwig that it is important to examine how interactants\nuse mental state terms for various purposes. In doing so the\nmechanism that Symons refers to retains its triadic struc-\nture, within its interactional context. As we noted in our tar-\nget article, words that are not considered mental state terms\nmay still be important in talk about the psychological world.\nAlthough there is little research on this topic, Lohmann and\nTomasello\u2019s (2003) language training study found no differ-\nence in training effect on false belief understanding be-\ntween a condition in which mental state terms were used\nand a condition in which communication verbs such as \u201csay\u201d\nand \u201ctell\u201d were used.\nAnother commentary asks us to identify how children\ncome to learn criteria for mental state terms. Barresi &\nMoore are concerned that our theory potentially reduces\nto teacher-based enculturation. We feel that their depiction\nof language and criteria in our target article is incomplete\nbecause in section 3.1 we are at pains to identify the cen-\ntrality of children\u2019s constructions of knowledge. This dis-\ncussion was set into the framework of practices and criteria\nin section 3.2 to identify the dynamics of the epistemic tri-\nangle. In contrast to Barresi & Moore, we suggest that our\ncombined use of Piagetian theory and criteria protects us\nfrom an enculturation view. In addressing this criticism we\nrefer to a distinction that Bickhard points out in his com-\nmentary, which is that, although children learn the mean-\ning of words in terms of criteria, what is learned is not con-\nstituted by the criteria. Furthermore, it is not just that\nchildren learn culturally specific words for mental phe-\nnomena such as seeing; rather, these words are added to\nand become part of a practice. So, according to our position\n(and against a possibility considered by Barresi & Moore),\nlearning practices do not depend on a theory of mind; in-\nfants develop expectations about what will happen in cer-\ntain situations in their practical, lived knowledge. For ex-\nample, when a child learns to point declaratively to direct\nothers\u2019 attention she is beginning to learn something about\nother people, the world, and how to coordinate her direct-\nedness toward aspects of the world with other people\u2019s di-\nrectedness, or attention. Then, within interactions in which\nwords are used to accompany pointing, she may add the\nword \u201clook\u201d to this shared practice. That is, this practice of\npointing is one possible criterion for the use of the word\n\u201clook.\u201d And, of course, the use of words is a constructive\nprocess, it cannot simply be social transmitted (see Nel-\nson\u2019s comment about word use without meaning).\nR2.3. Structure and executive functions\nA third set of commentaries ask us to clarify the nature of\nthe cognitive system that the child develops. Miller &\nM\u00fcller argue that we need to describe the knowledge\nstructures that characterize different levels of social under-\nstanding. The term \u201cstructure\u201d is ambiguous because it can\nbe interpreted as causally determining thinking or as a for-\nmal description of forms of thought (Chandler 1991; Chap-\nman 1987b). We assume that Miller & M\u00fcller would not\nmean it in the causal or functional sense but rather in the\nformal sense. However, in the list of theories they provide\nit is likely that a majority of theorists think of their struc-\ntures as causal in the process of reasoning. In addition, one\nposition that is missing, the theory theory, is assumed by\nGopnik and Wellman (1992, p. 147) to be causal in the\nsense that the process of reasoning involves applying the\nlaws of the theory. Another issue is whether structures are\ngeneral across content. Most of the theorists listed by Miller\n& M\u00fcller would take this position; that is, once acquired,\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n136 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\nthe structure would apply across content and in various cir-\ncumstances. Our position, however, is that functionally \ndistinct structures develop for each of the forms of joint at-\ntention. For example, pointings of different types (follow-\ning pointing, following gaze, etc.) develop individually but\nthese become reciprocally assimilated. That is, they are all\nactivated by interacting with people and are combined\ngradually during social interactions.\nIn discussing the development of structure, Miller &\nM\u00fcller quote Piaget (1967, p. 147): \u201cGenesis emanates\nfrom a structure and culminates in another structure.\u201d\nThere are suggestions in some other commentaries that go\nbeyond our original analysis and illustrate just what is im-\nplied in this quotation. Fonagy is in broad agreement with\nour position and in drawing connections between Piaget\nand Bowlby (as does Symons from a critical perspective).\nBut Fonagy also suggests other ways to think about the con-\nnections between attachment and social understanding. We\nagree with him (and Steele, who also mentions it) that an\nissue which we did not discuss is the role of attachment in\nemotional regulation. The structure of parent-child inter-\naction plays a role in the child\u2019s emotional regulation, and\nthis structure is gradually internalized into the patterns we\nsee in classic attachment relationships. Fonagy also extends\nthe same sort of argument to effortful control and inhibi-\ntion, as abilities that develop within interpersonal engage-\nment and are fostered by secure attachment relationships.\nWe agree and, as we argue below, this fits nicely with our\nposition that executive functioning is influenced by the\nchild\u2019s history of social experience, not just an unfolding in\nmaturation.\nFernyhough also wants us to specify the cognitive pro-\ncesses that result from developmental processes, whereas\nGerrans asks us to specify the cognitive processes that lead\nto development. This reveals the greatly differing theoreti-\ncal perspectives that have been put to us. Our approach is\nfar closer to Chesnokova in her useful term \u201cagency me-\ndiation\u201d and to Fernyhough, who says that we explain how\nsocial competence develops but not what it is. Fernyhough\nis right that this is an aspect that we only hinted at and did\nnot fully develop. He further wonders if the epistemic tri-\nangle is just a context for development or whether it, in ad-\ndition, plays a role in children\u2019s reasoning about the mind.\nFernyhough\u2019s discussion of Vygotsky is welcome and it is\nconsistent with our position, developed from Chapman\u2019s\ntheory. Chapman\u2019s position, drawing on Piaget, Vygotsky,\nand Gal\u2019perin, is that the epistemic triangle is interiorized\nas a whole:\ninteriorized communicative exchange between the subject and\nthe interiorized interlocutor is the origin of reflective aware-\nness. The coordination of cognitive operations by the subject\nand the interlocutor is the source of the \u201coperational composi-\ntions\u201d that characterize concrete operations. Such coordina-\ntions are the interiorized counterpart of interpersonal cooper-\nation. (Chapman 1991, p. 219)\nPiaget (1962\/2000) agreed with Vygotsky\u2019s view that re-\nflective thought arises due to the interiorization of egocen-\ntric speech. Thus, in response to Miller & M\u00fcller, devel-\nopment \u201cemanates\u201d from the structure of triadic interaction\nwhich includes the structures that the child brings to the in-\nteraction, and it \u201cculminates\u201d in the interiorized structure\nof the epistemic triangle. As skills become consolidated,\nfurther levels of the structure involve the ability to reflect\nupon this interiorised epistemic triangle. These develop in\na local, piecemeal way, not \u2013 as hinted at by Miller & M\u00fcller\n\u2013 by the application of a new rule or representation system.\nThe issue of structure has been made more complex by\nrecent work, which links social development with what are\ntaken to be domain general skills under the banner of ex-\necutive functions. Hala suggests that our position is com-\npatible with executive function accounts. We agree that an\naspect of our approach that needs elaboration is in relation\nto the notion of executive functions, and in our target arti-\ncle we could only acknowledge that in a brief note. Two key\nissues are raised. First, as has often been pointed out (Mon-\nsell 1996; Rabbitt 1997; Towse et al. 2000), the notion of ex-\necutive functions is complex and ill-defined even in adults,\nso we must be immediately cautious about describing indi-\nvidual skills or the ragbag of \u201cexecutive\u201d skills as given.\nHowever, recent structural equation modeling analyses\nsuggest that in both adults (Miyake et al. 2000) and children\n(Shimmon et al. 2003) there is distinctiveness between ar-\neas of executive test performance (e.g., working memory is\ndistinct from set shifting), but individual constructs like\nthese fit best into a unified latent variable \u201cexecutive func-\ntion.\u201d However, performance on test batteries does not re-\nveal conceptual links between, or a developmental model\nof, such skills. An advantage of an activity-based approach\nis that we do not have to think of something like \u201cattention\u201d\nor \u201cattention-shifting\u201d as independent characteristics of the\nchild which the child brings to the interaction. Instead the\nchild\u2019s \u201cattentiveness\u201d may well be influenced by the inter-\naction of the dyad (Hobson, in press).\nTherefore, second, we do not think it is helpful to assume\nthat executive functions simply unfold with maturation.\nRather, we agree with Hala that the development of these\nparticular skills is likely to be complex, embedded within\nthe nature of children\u2019s experiences. She points out that\nthere might be a deeper relation between executive skills\nand different aspects of social understanding and that there\nis a bidirectional relationship between the child and other\npeople. We would take the analysis further to examine a\nnumber of other bidirectional patterns of influence within\nthe epistemic triangle \u2013 including interactions between\neach executive skill. It is these links that we take to be the\nmore complex structures that are developing in the child\nand which are hinted at in the research cited by Hala. Al-\nthough we acknowledge that such ideas are in need of sup-\nportive evidence, we note recent data which show that so-\ncial interaction (maternal verbal scaffolding of the child) at\nage 3 years is linked with the child\u2019s language at age 4 and\nsearch retrieval skills at age 6 (Landry et al. 2002). Such\nfindings suggest that the development of executive skills is\nembedded in the child\u2019s social experiences.\nR3. Should the theory be extended?\nSeveral commentators have offered suggestions about how\nour theory can be improved. In our response on infancy,\nabove, we agreed that an understanding of social develop-\nment must have as its starting point the dyadic exchanges\nbetween individuals. One of the points that we understated\nin the target article was that much of this interaction is\nhighly affectively laden and what the child constructs within\nthe interaction is charged with emotion. In the main, the\ncommentaries discussed in this section reflect upon the\nways in which the theory we present can be improved by\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 137\nembedding the epistemic triangle within a wider and more\nenriched social process \u2013 the reason why we are prepared\nto refer to it as the epistemic-relational triangle. The target\narticle suggests that this framework is needed in order to\nunderstand the dynamic between the subject-interlocutor\nand subject-object interaction involved in the development\nof knowledge. We admit that we couched our analysis in a\nway that enabled an exchange and critique of the traditional\napproaches in this area that we have just discussed \u2013 ap-\nproaches in which mental states are segregated from any-\nthing that remotely resembles human experience. The\ncommentaries we discuss in this section mainly point out\nthat there is more to the development of social knowledge\nthan the emergence of the child\u2019s ability to reflect on cog-\nnitive mental states like beliefs. These other aspects of de-\nvelopment hinge on issues that we hinted at in the target ar-\nticle, surrounding the nature and importance of affective\nengagement both in infancy and, indeed, all human social\nunderstanding. We welcome such a move, as long as the dy-\nnamic of subject-interlocutor and subject-object is kept in\nplace.\nR3.1. The role of relationships in social development:\nLet\u2019s get emotional\nWe are impressed by the ways in which several of the com-\nmentators extend our analysis of the role of the individual\u2019s\nconstructions within interactions into specific types of rela-\ntionships such as siblings and peers, and the importance of\naffect engagement, particularly in attachment relationships\nand emotional relatedness. However, as a result of com-\nments from Gerrans, Meins, and Steele, we first need to\nclarify the relational position we endorse.\nGerrans seems to think that rejecting individualism\nmeans we cannot talk about the characteristics of individu-\nals, like those with autism. To the contrary, rejecting indi-\nvidualism does not mean that we ignore the fact that indi-\nviduals vary in the characteristics they bring to interaction.\nMcGeer asks us to clarify that a rejection of individualism\ndoes not imply rejecting internalism. We agree. We do not\njust focus on the individual or the social. Relationism or sys-\ntemism takes the strengths of both individualism and col-\nlectivism. Our \u201cmechanism\u201d is the internalization of action\nand interaction. That is, our explanation for the develop-\nment of social understanding cannot be individualistic be-\ncause it depends on the relations between people. But nei-\nther is it holistic because obviously individuals interact and\nbring their characteristics to that interaction. Gerrans is\nright that children with disorders such as autism have some\nneurological impairment. However, the whole story cannot\nbe told on the basis of the individual. Instead, the relations\nbetween people are essential, because children with other\ndifficulties such as deafness or severe social deprivation\nmay also develop an autism-like syndrome (Hobson 2002).\nIn contrast to Gerrans, Meins claims that we focus too\nmuch on the child and that \u201cthe child\u2019s attributes may ini-\ntially be rather unimportant.\u201d We should not focus on either\nthe child or the other person; rather it is the relations be-\ntween them that are important. Of course, both interactants\nwill influence those relations due to their characteristics.\nThe claim that individual differences in caregivers are im-\nportant is embedded in our position, and therefore we do\nnot assume that all mother-infant and child-sibling rela-\ntionships are the same, contrary to Meins\u2019s reading. Meins\nis right that the effects of siblings and of parenting style\nhave been found only with preschoolers but this reflects the\nnature of the available data, not necessarily that we are try-\ning to explain the wrong evidence. Within our framework it\nis important to examine the nature of sibling relationships\n(the quality of interaction, etc.), not just whether or not the\nchild has a sibling.\nMeins notes that we mention the link between attach-\nment security and social understanding and implies that we\nbelieve this is a direct link. In fact, we mention this as evi-\ndence that requires an explanation, not as an explanation it-\nself. However, we do clearly agree with Meins that mere ex-\nposure to mental state language is not enough for children\u2019s\nsocial development. What she calls for in her final para-\ngraph regarding an integrated system is just what we mean\nby a focus on relations.\nHowe is in agreement with our position and suggests ex-\ntensions by further focusing on children\u2019s sibling relation-\nships, their friendships, and their pretend play. We agree,\nand further suggest that in such extensions we need a the-\nory with which to make sense of various forms of interac-\ntion. We wanted to make it clear that the Piagetian distinc-\ntion between constraining and cooperative relationships\nwas originally introduced by Piaget (1932\/1965b, 1977\/\n1995) by contrasting parent and peer relations. Steele\nviews Piaget\u2019s distinction between constraining and coop-\nerative relationships as a \u201cdichotomous model.\u201d However,\nthe target article states clearly that Piaget\u2019s distinction\nrefers to a continuous model because any relationship (i.e.,\nparent-child, siblings, and peers) is some mixture of these\ntwo types.\nWe acknowledge Steele\u2019s claim that other aspects of so-\ncial relationships should be considered to capture the com-\nplexities of human relationships. Some of his suggestions\nappear to refer to the content of discussion. In our article\nwe recognize the importance of both what is being talked\nabout and the influence of the relationship on the child\u2019s\nunderstanding of that talk. Steele extends this analysis to\ndescribe the types of attachment relationship, but not ex-\nplicitly to the processes that constitute such types. We feel\nthat a more profitable extension of our analysis within at-\ntachment theory would be to follow the suggestion of Fon-\nagy and Thompson & Raikes, who focus more closely\nupon the dynamics of attachment and emotional relation-\nships. Both these perspectives are constructive, affective\nadditions to the approach we propose. We feel that, just as\ncognitively based models like ours need an emotional di-\nmension provided by these theoretical perspectives, at-\ntachment-based accounts also need an analysis of triadic in-\nteraction in our sense, particularly into which language is\nintegrated. So we hope that the argument is more \u201cnew\u201d\nthan Steele suggests.\nWe also concur with Banerjee who discusses the role of\nsocial experience, or self-regulation, in advanced social \nunderstanding, such as the role of peer interactions in\nlearning about interpretation. Zerwas, Balaraman &\nBrownell (Zerwas et al.) provide an elaboration of the\nrole of peers in social development and the special chal-\nlenges and opportunities afforded by peers, involving op-\nportunities for cooperation as well as conflict. The role of\nconflict is also discussed by Howe and Thompson &\nRaikes. At least one important aspect of conflict between\nmothers and their children concerns how mothers deal with\nand talk about inevitable conflicts that occur with young\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n138 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\ntoddlers (Laible & Thompson 2002). This line of evidence\nfits with the evidence reviewed in our target article.\nMost of the commentaries discussed in this section sug-\ngest that we should extend our framework to include dif-\nferent types of social relationships. Two commentators\n(Nelson, Vinden) feel that an understanding of such rela-\ntionships can be achieved only within a wider cultural\nframework and that we did not go far enough in this direc-\ntion. Vinden advances a constructivistic view of encultura-\ntion, albeit using terminology slightly different from ours.\nWe do not disagree with her suggestion. Our purpose was\nto distinguish our position of construction and reconstruc-\ntion from a view of passive socialization or the transmission\nof knowledge. We do not dismiss the importance of culture.\nWe agree that the child will influence the relationship with\nher caregivers, but we do not think that enculturation is the\nright word for this, given that it is often taken to consist of\nthe passive passing on of beliefs, conventions, and so on,\nfrom one generation to the next. Nelson also thinks that we\ndid not go far enough in the cultural-historical direction.\nWe agree that such an approach should be taken and we be-\nlieve that ours could easily be expanded in that direction.\nHowever, we would emphasize that \u201cculture\u201d should not be\nreified. It is created and recreated by interactants within\neveryday interactions (Berger & Luckmann 1966), thus the\nepistemic triangle is a means of understanding the dynamic\nbetween individual action and everyday practices. In the\nnext section we elaborate on further possible developments\nof our theory raised in the commentaries.\nR3.2. Broadening our conception of social\nunderstanding: Let\u2019s get more emotional \n(and normative)\nIn this section we add four perspectives from the commen-\ntators which are consistent with and further extend our the-\nory. First, we must broaden the age span examined in the\ntarget article, as suggested by Mitchell. Banerjee and\nJenkins & Oatley helpfully list further development in so-\ncial understanding beyond five years of age. We want to em-\nphasize our strong agreement that our list of issues beyond\nfalse belief needs to be extended, because Louren\u00e7o ap-\npeared to have the impression that we might be thinking\nthat development in social understanding stops at age eight\nyears with the beginnings of an interpretative understand-\ning of knowledge. Jenkins and Oatley provide examples of\ndistributed cognition within the crew of a navy ship to hint\nat the use of the epistemic triangle in adult learning, as each\nspecialist tries to negotiate meaning with his or her col-\nleague. Their term \u201cprioritization of joint goals\u201d can be ap-\nplied well after age eight years. Banerjee further broadens\nthe conceptualization of social understanding to include\nirony (see also Yasui 2003), self-presentational motives, and\nemotions such as embarrassment in a wider variety of rela-\ntionships, particularly with peers. To this broadening of how\nwe think about social understanding and social competence\nwe could add the development of competence in social in-\nteraction, such as politeness (Brown & Levinson 1987; Turn-\nbull 2003). Our theory provides a framework with which to\nincorporate these extensions. Only if developmental psy-\nchology extends the focus of the field in directions like these\nwill we be able to address McGeer\u2019s question of what is in-\ncluded in \u201csocial understanding.\u201d We agree with her sug-\ngestion that what is developing is not just a body of knowl-\nedge, but rather a set of practices and that this involves the\ndevelopment of social agency and the ability to interact\nwithin a community. The issue of agency is also hinted at by\nSokol & Lalonde (see Sokol & Chandler 2003). Russell\n(1996) has identified the depth of the role of agency in the\ndevelopment of knowledge, but he downplays analysis of its\nsocial dimension.\nThe second issue concerns the extension of our frame-\nwork to include other aspects of cognition, not usually linked\nto a social dimension. Smith questions whether we can ac-\ncount for the development of normativity from the per-\nspective of the epistemic triangle. We recognize that the is-\nsue of normativity, or how we get from the causal conditions\nof knowledge to normative knowledge, is a neglected prob-\nlem in developmental psychology, and it is also a test of an\nadequate theory of development. We did not deal with the\nissue of normativity, but we believe that our approach could\nbe extended to do so for the reason that our position is based\non Piagetian ideas about the development of knowledge.\n(Note that the computational approach advocated by Ger-\nrans and the neuro-reductive approach championed by\nCraig & Barrett cannot recognize normativity as a topic of\nstudy.) As Smith (1993) argues, one of the goals of Piaget\u2019s\ngenetic (i.e., developmental) epistemology was to ground\nnormativity in the natural world \u2013 that is, to \u201cshow how to\nsecure a place for the normative within the natural\u201d (Kitch-\nener 2004, p. 61). In Kitchener\u2019s words, Piaget\u2019s solution to\nthis problem was that \u201cepistemic norms emerge from cer-\ntain kind of social relations between individuals \u2013 those in-\nvolving cooperation\u201d (p. 62). Therefore, a necessary compo-\nnent for normativity is social interaction of particular types.\nBy this token, all of Smith\u2019s examples of normativity are\nrooted in social interaction because they are justifications.\nWe suggest that an act of judgment does not exist outside of\nhuman practices. For example, Smith\u2019s case [E] appears to\nbe an instance of the epistemic triangle in action.\nThird, several commentators argue that we need to in-\nclude emotions more fully (Banerjee, Fonagy, Hobson,\nIzard, Thompson & Raikes). We agree with Izard that\nthere are a number of ways in which our account could be\nfurther extended to integrate the role of emotions. She\npoints out many areas of literature that could enrich our\nperspective. As we argue below, with reference to a similar\npoint made by Fonagy, such additions will more fully in-\ncorporate the role of emotions in social development be-\nginning in infancy, and they are entirely consistent with our\napproach. Like Izard, we would avoid any hard and fast line\nbetween cognition and emotion because many emotions\ncannot be simply separated from cognition, as in surprise,\nenvy, and jealousy. Second, as Izard suggests, emotions may\nplay a role in influencing the relationships young children\nengage in, which in turn may influence the development of\ntheir social understanding. Such emotion may be partially\nattributed to the child\u2019s characteristics but must take into\naccount the interaction between the child and the other\nperson. We agree with Banerjee that the notion of self-reg-\nulation provides a crucial link with our own framework for\nunderstanding the child\u2019s internalization of the epistemic\ntriangle. From our perspective it follows that children learn\nabout emotions in the same way that they learn about be-\nliefs and intentions. Finally, Thompson & Raikes extend the\nneed to study emotional development in children\u2019s early\nunderstanding of mental states within a broader attachment\nframework.\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind   \nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1 139\nThe fourth area of research suggested in the commen-\ntaries is a focus upon more intricate details of the child\u2019s\nconversations with others (Astington, Nelson, Siegal,\nThompson & Raikes, Walker-Andrews & Hudson). We\nfind Nelson\u2019s label of \u201ccollaborative construction\u201d helpful as\nit places the child\u2019s developing understanding within a net-\nwork of social relationships and the ebb and flow of every-\nday discourse. It provides clear guidelines for how research\non children\u2019s understanding of the mind should be con-\nducted. This is exemplified in the research areas described\nby Walker-Andrews & Hudson: We agree that the work\nthey review on emotion perception, pretence understand-\ning, event knowledge, and autobiographical memory will\nadd to the richness of our account of mental state under-\nstanding. Thompson & Raikes suggest that we neglect sev-\neral explicit and implicit features of conversational dis-\ncourse such as provocative questions, elaborative detail,\nand mothers\u2019 reference to emotions. We agree that it is im-\nportant to consider other aspects of relationships beyond\ncooperation and constraint, as well as to examine coopera-\ntive interaction in concrete detail. However, we also feel\nthat when considering factors such as these, the notion of\ncooperation may be useful because such forms of discourse\nmay facilitate development more in cooperative relation-\nships than in constraining relationships.\nAstington makes the interesting suggestion that the\nchild\u2019s linguistic ability and experience in social and com-\nmunicative interaction may play different roles in social de-\nvelopment, although she acknowledges that the two factors\nare related. However, in the view we take of language as ac-\ntivity, it would seem to be very hard conceptually to sepa-\nrate such factors. There are also potential empirical prob-\nlems with the way theory of mind data are collected, which\nwe refer to in the target article\u2019s concluding section. To use\nAstington\u2019s research examples, we need to know about the\nquality of interactions of deaf children with hearing par-\nents, and the parent-child dyads in hearing children with no\nsiblings but high language ability, in order to reveal the pos-\nsible reasons why these children appear to be different in\ntheir false belief performance compared to other groups.\nNevertheless, Astington\u2019s commentary underlines the im-\nportance of analyzing language and communication in\ndetail, as well as our conceptions of language (Budwig,\nNelson). The important issue is that reference to \u201cconver-\nsation\u201d alone is not sufficient either to undermine our posi-\ntion or to explain the influence of interaction on cognition.\nIndeed, it can lead to the problems that are inherent in\nSiegal\u2019s account. He appears to suggest that (1) the child\u2019s\ntheory of mind is situated within her or his cognitive archi-\ntecture, and (2) the false belief performance is essentially\nan understanding of conversation. The fact that Siegal of-\nfers no definition of \u201cconversation\u201d stands in contrast to the\naccounts of Nelson and Thompson & Raikes. His de-\nscription offers little in the way in which the architecture\ndevelops or how the term conversation helps in his analy-\nsis. The target article and many commentaries attempt to\ngrapple with these links.\nR4. Feeling our way forward\nWe expected more criticism of both our use of a Wittgen-\nsteinian analysis of word-world relations and the blend with\na mix of Piagetian and Vygotskian constructivism. We are\nslightly puzzled by the relative lack of explicit critiques of\neither these individual theories or how we put them to-\ngether. We see this cocktail as providing a fundamental cri-\ntique of the study of social development, or indeed any de-\nvelopmental or cognitive theory, in which meaning is\nslipped in before the theory is articulated. We welcome fur-\nther discussion on this issue because we agree with Nelson\nthat the implications are potentially profound.\nThe stumbling block for many of our commentators was\nthe lack of a \u201cmechanism\u201d in our theory. One implication of\nthe theoretical origins of our approach is that it is activity-\nbased and grounded in practices, not internal representa-\ntions. Structure arises as a result of the process. Thus, the\nmechanism and the process are the same, and each is based\non the child\u2019s constructions of social interactions, where\nmeanings are negotiated. We realize that this unsettles\nsome commentators but it follows naturally from our cri-\ntique of their assumptions. The implications for research\nare first that we need more (not less) neurotic task fixation\n(although not just on false belief tasks), in which we try to\nwork out how children construct meaning in a wider range\nof settings and tasks beyond false belief. Second, we need\nto conduct research on the development of children\u2019s\nshared practices upon which mental state understanding\ndevelops. The studies of Judy Dunn and the ideas outlined\nin the conclusion to our target article provide examples.\nIt was clear from the commentaries that we need to ex-\ntend the theory, and most of the commentators felt that this\nwas a relatively straightforward task. Although we need to\nadd affective engagement in infancy and beyond, we agree\nwith many (e.g., Banerjee, Fonagy, Izard, Steele) that\ncognition and emotion should not be completely separated\n\u2013 both are aspects of the individual\u2019s reaction to and con-\nstructions of events. But we maintain that the epistemic \ntriangle is a vital formulation for understanding how indi-\nviduals develop knowledge and it adds to the affective en-\ngagements described by many, including those from an at-\ntachment perspective. We have not described how our\nframework might work at higher levels of the structure, and\nwe need to go further in explaining the development of\nstructure by providing an account of how the epistemic tri-\nangle within particular domains of thought itself becomes\nan object of reflection.\nWe thank the referees of the original submission, the \neditors at BBS, and the commentators for their work, their\nchallenges, and their constructive criticism. They have\nforced us to assimilate some points and painfully to accom-\nmodate others, thus reassuring us that the constructive\nprocess continues in development. As Astington\u2019s com-\nmentary suggests, it seems that the field is changing. We\nlook forward to a further consolidation of socially grounded\ntheory of children\u2019s social understanding.\nNOTES\n1. Louren\u00e7o also suggests that our theory is not necessary be-\ncause it does not go beyond theories such as Selman\u2019s (1980). Sel-\nman\u2019s theory is compatible with our position, but there are some\nimportant differences. Selman already assumes much of what we\nare trying to explain because he does not provide an account of in-\nfant social development. Furthermore he does not account for the\nrole of language in social development. What he does do well is\nprovide a description of the levels of complexity of different situ-\nations of social understanding, and integrating his theory could po-\ntentially extend our position.\nLouren\u00e7o also asserts that we claimed to differ from Thelen\nand Smith because of the \u201cideas of interactionism and transac-\nResponse\/Carpendale & Lewis: Constructing an understanding of mind\n140 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2004) 27:1\ntionalism.\u201d In fact, we did not say this. Rather, in Note 3 in our tar-\nget article we state that although we have much in common with\ndynamic systems theories we appear to differ from Thelen et al.\n(2001) in the starting point in infant development. That is, they\nseem to assume objectivity rather than explain it (M\u00fcller &\nCarpendale 2001).\n2. We refer anyone still convinced of fundamental differences\nbetween Piaget and Vygotsky to Smith\u2019s (1996) test of 10 state-\nments from each of these theorists, which stump even experts (see\nalso Amin & Valsiner 2004).\n3. Miller & M\u00fcller note that in other work (Turnbull &\nCarpendale 1999a) we reject the code model of language (i.e., the\nview that language works by encoding meaning in words and ut-\nterances that are then transmitted to others for decoding) and they\nargue that the \u201clanguage code\u201d is also important. Our reasons for\nrejecting the code model is that the same word or utterance can\nbe used to convey different meanings when used within different\ncontexts of ongoing sequences of interaction (Turnbull & Carpen-\ndale 1999a). That is, as Budwig notes, language is indexical (e.g.,\nBudwig et al. 2000; Suchman 1987; Turnbull 2003). This suggests\nthat rather than thinking of language as having fixed meanings at-\ntached to representations (the view of language that Wittgenstein\nargued against), we should think of language as a means for di-\nrecting and coordinating attention with others within shared so-\ncial settings (Tomasello 2001; 2003). Miller and M\u00fcller are right\nthat a word such as \u201cthink\u201d can be used in many different ways, in\nmany different language games. From this we take the point that\nwe need to describe in more concrete detail how children might\nlearn about the many ways the word \u201cthink\u201d can be used.\nReferences\nLetters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d appearing before authors\u2019 initials refer to target article\nand response, respectively.\nAbe, J.
