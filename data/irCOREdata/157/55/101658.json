This paper \nexplains the destination concept and attempts to synthesise several models for strategic marketing \nand management of destinations. It provides an overview of several techniques widely used and \nillustrates examples from around the world. The paper also explains that marketing of destinations \nshould balance the strategic objectives of all stakeholders as well the sustainability of local \nresources. Destinations need to differentiate their products and develop partnerships between the \npublic and private sector locally in order to co-ordinate delivery. Taking advantage of new \ntechnologies and the Internet also enables destinations to enhance their competitiveness by \nincreasing their visibility, reducing costs and enhancing local co-operation. Destination marketing \nmust lead to the optimisation of tourism impacts and the achievement of the strategic objectives for \nall stakeholders.  \n \n11. Introducing destinations and destination marketing  \n \nDestination marketing facilitates the achievement of tourism policy, which should be co-ordinated \nwith the regional development strategic plan. Marketing of destinations should also guide the \ntourism impacts optimisation and the maximisation of benefits for the region. In order to appreciate \nthe complexity of destination marketing this paper explains the destination concept and attempts to \nsynthesise several models for strategic marketing and management of destinations.  \n \nThe analysis illustrates numerous frameworks for the development of a destination marketing \nstrategy and a comprehensive marketing mix. The paper also illustrates the relationship between \nmarketing and planning of destinations and their conflicting and symbiotic relationship. This paper \nis based on research and consultancy on destination marketing around the world, where several \nframeworks have been tested and implemented. It discusses a wide spectrum of destination \nmarketing tools and provides plentiful references for researchers who would like to study in-depth \neach technique. Although the suggestions and conclusions presented here are inevitably \ngeneralised, destinations can use the suggested methodology in order to develop and implement \ntheir strategic plan and marketing policies. The contribution of the paper is therefore in \nsynthesising well-developed techniques and to provide a comprehensive framework for destination \nmarketing rather than to introduce original research outcomes. \n \n2. Destination as an amalgam of tourism services and experiences \n \nDestinations are amalgams of tourism products, offering an integrated experience to consumers. \nTraditionally, destinations are regarded as well-defined geographical areas, such as a country, an \nisland or a town. However, it is increasingly recognised that a destination can also a perceptual \nconcept, which can be interpreted subjectively by consumers, depending on their travel itinerary, \ncultural background, purpose of visit, educational level and past experience. For example, London \ncan be a destination for a German business traveller, whilst Europe may be the destination for a \nleisure Japanese tourist who packs six European countries in a two week tour. Some travellers will \nconsider a cruise ship to be their destination, while others on the same cruise may perceive the \nports visited during the trip as their destination. Often destinations are artificially divided by \ngeographical and political barriers, which fail to take into consideration consumer preferences or \ntourism industry functions. An example of that is the Alps shared by France, Austria, Switzerland, \nItaly by often perceived and consumed as part of the same product by skiers. For the purpose of \nthis paper destinations are considered to be a defined geographical region which is understood by \nits visitors as a unique entity, with a political and legislative framework for tourism marketing and \nplanning. This definition enables Destination Management Organisations (DMOs) to be \naccountable for the planning and marketing of the region and to have the power and resources to \nundertake action towards achieving its strategic objectives.  \n \nDestinations offer an amalgam of tourism products and services, which are consumed under the \nbrand name of the destination. Leiper (1995, p.87) explains that destinations are places towards \nwhich people travel and where they choose to stay for a while in order to experience certain \nfeatures or characteristics-a perceived attraction of some sort. Cooper et al (1998) define \ndestinations as the focus of facilities and services designed to meet the needs of the tourists. Most \ndestinations comprise a core of the following components, which can be characterised as the six \nAs framework as illustrated in Table 1. Therefore, a destination can be regarded as a combination \n(or even as a brand) of all products, services and ultimately experiences provided locally. It also \nenables us to assess the impact of tourism regionally, as well as manage demand and supply in \norder to maximise benefits for all stakeholders. \n \n2Table 1: Six As Framework for the analysis of tourism destinations \n \n\u0001 Attractions (natural, man-made, artificial, purpose built, heritage, special events) \n\u0001 Accessibility (entire transportation system comprising of routes, terminals and vehicles) \n\u0001 Amenities (accommodation and catering facilities, retailing, other tourist services) \n\u0001 Available packages (pre-arranged packages by intermediaries and principals) \n\u0001 Activities (all activities available at the destination and what consumers will do during their \nvisit) \n\u0001 Ancillary services (services used by tourists such as banks, telecommunications, post, \nnewsagents, hospitals,  etc) \nAlthough there is plenty of literature on destination planning and development of facilities (Inskeep, \n1991 and 1994; Pearce, 1989; Gunn, 1994; Davidson and Maitland, 1997), there are few textbooks \nexamining destination marketing (Heath and Wall, 1992; Goodall and Ashworth, 1988) and even \nfewer illustrate destinations as an experience-provider for tourists and locals (Ryan, 1997 and 1991a). \nThis is also reflected in the academic literature published in journals and other scientific publications. \nThe inadequacy of destination marketing literature probably illustrates the interest of researchers in \nthe impacts of tourism on destinations. Hence, the management and marketing of destinations is often \nleft to industry people and consultants and it is not frequently discussed in the literature or in academic \ndebates. The competitive nature of destination marketing also prevents involved parties from \npublishing their strategies and marketing plans. In addition, there is an apparent difference between \nthe marketing and planning tourism literature.  \n \nTraditionally marketing concentrates on increasing visitation and treats tourism like any other \ncommodity. This approach fails to recognise the unique needs and limitations of each destination as \nwell as their particular geographical, environmental and socio-cultural characteristics. In contrast, \nplanning literature concentrates more on the impacts of tourism and on limiting tourism development, \noften ignoring the market dynamics and the requirements of entrepreneurs at the destination and the \nplace of origin (Ryan,1991b; Burns,1999). Ryan (1991b) explains that companies and governments \nin tourism have applied only part of the marketing mix to tourism, i.e., promotion, with little attention \nbeing paid to the other components of marketing. However, if tourism is to survive by generating \nsatisfaction among interacting tourists and hosts, it must adopt societal marketing strategies. This \ninvolves carefully monitoring tourist satisfaction levels and using these as part of the criteria for \nsuccess, rather than increasing numbers of tourists; continually monitoring host reactions to \ntourists, for host-tourist interaction is an important component of the tourist experience; and being \naware that infrastructure development of tourism resort areas has implications for the types of \ntourists that will be attracted (Ryan, 1991b). \n \n3. The strategic purpose of destinations and their management and marketing \n \nDestinations are some of the most difficult entities to manage and market, due to the complexity of the \nrelationships of local stakeholders (Sautter and Leisen,1999). Managing and marketing destinations \nis also challenging because of the variety of stakeholders involved in the development and \nproduction of tourism products. The destination experience is essentially comprised of regions, \nresources and amalgams of tourism facilities and services, which often do not belong to \nindividuals. Instead they represent a collection of both professional and personal interests of all the \npeople who live and work in the area. Managing often conflicting stakeholders\u2019 interests makes \ncontrolling and marketing destinations as a whole extremely challenging. Hence, strategies and \nactions should take into account the wishes of all stakeholders, namely indigenous people, \nbusinesses and investors, tourists, tour operators and intermediaries, and interest groups. Perhaps \nthe most difficult problem is ensuring the rational use of zero-priced public goods, such as \nlandscapes, mountains, and the sea for the benefit of all stakeholders and at the same time \npreserving the resources for future generations. Conflicts can easily develop, especially when \nsome (perhaps greedy) stakeholders exploit resources for short-term benefits. A compromise \nencompassing all these interests is extremely difficult if not impossible, but is the key to long term \nsuccess (Buhalis, 1999a; Buhalis and Fletcher,1995; Jamal and Getz,1996; Yuksel et al, 1999; \nPalmer, and Bejou, 1995). \n3And yet tourists perceive the destination as a brand comprising of a collection of suppliers and \nservices. Before visiting they develop an image about destinations as well as a set of expectations \nbased on previous experience, word of mouth, press reports, advertising, and common beliefs (Chon, \n1991 and 1992; Baloglu and Brinberg, 1997). During their holiday, they \u201cconsume\u201d destinations as a \ncomprehensive experience, without often realising that each element of the product are produced and \nmanaged by individual players. Most service providers are small and medium-sized tourism \nenterprises which have a wide range of strengths and weaknesses whilst are also characterised by \ntheir independent nature (Buhalis and Cooper,1998, Cooper and Buhalis, 1992). Tourists' overall \nexperience is composed of numerous small encounters with a variety of tourism principals, such as \ntaxi drivers, hoteliers, waiters, as well as with elements of the local attractions such as museums, \ntheatres, beaches, theme parks etc. Their overall impression develops their image of a destination \nafter their visitation. As a consequence there is much overlapping between strategic marketing of the \ndestination as a whole and of each individual supplier at the region. Hence, the competitiveness of \neach player is often interrelated and almost indistinguishable from one another. \n \nAs consumers increasingly value environmental resources they are prepared to pay for them \npremium prices (Pigram,1996; Archer,1996; Thomas, 1992; Garrod and Willis, 1992; Laarman, and \nGregersen, 1996). Hence, local resources become a central asset for destinations and tourism \nsuppliers and their sustainability a core function of tourism marketing. Middleton and Hawkins \n(1998,p.8) state that \u201ca marketing perspective is essentially an overall management orientation \nreflecting corporate attitudes that, in the case of travel and tourism, must balance the interests of \nshareholders\/owners with the long-run environmental interests of a destination and at the same \ntime meet the demands and expectations of customers\u201d. \n \nDMOs tend to be part of the local, regional or national government and have political and \nlegislative power as well as the financial means to manage resources rationally and to ensure that \nall stakeholders can benefit in the long term. Destination management and marketing should act as \ntools and facilitators to achieve a complex range of strategic objectives, which will ultimately need \nto satisfy the needs and wants of stakeholders. Four key generic strategic objectives should be \naddressed by DMOs, as illustrated in Table 2. Figure 1 demonstrates the dynamic wheel of tourism \nstakeholders. The development and implementation of strategic objectives at destinations depends \non relationships between stakeholders and thus the implementation of the key generic strategic \nobjectives illustrated in Table 2 will be determined by the dynamics of the actors on this wheel. \nNaturally each stakeholder aims to maximise the benefits emerging for themselves. Inevitably, the \ninterests of some stakeholders may be conflicting with others and thus some of the four key \nstrategic objectives may be jeopardised. This is often a result of some stakeholder trying to \nenhance its benefit at the expense of others. For example a tour operator may try to reduce the \nprices paid to local suppliers in order to increase its profit margin and remain competitive in the \nmarketplace. It is imperative, therefore, for DMOs to use legislative and management tools during \nplanning and management of destinations in order to ensure that the benefits of tourism activity is \nshared fairly between all stakeholders and that sustainable practices safeguard the regeneration of \nresources utilised for the production of tourism (Buhalis,1995; Buhalis and Fletcher,1995; Sautter \nand Leisen, 1999). Failure to ensure and maintain a balance effectively jeopardises relationships \nbetween stakeholders, and threatens the achievement of the strategic objectives and the long term \ncompetitiveness and prosperity of destinations.  \n \nTable 2: Strategic management and marketing objectives for destinations \n \n\u0001 Enhance the long term prosperity of local people \n\u0001 Delight visitors by maximising their satisfaction \n\u0001 Maximise profitability of local enterprises and maximise multiplier effects \n\u0001 Optimise tourism impacts by ensuring a sustainable balance between economic benefits \nand socio-cultural and environmental costs \nFigure1 : The dynamic wheel of tourism stakeholders \n4Source: Adapted from Buhalis and Fletcher, 1995. \n \nHence, tourism marketing should not only be regarded as a tool for attracting more visitors to a \nregion, as it has been the case for most destinations. Instead, tourism marketing should operate as \na mechanism to facilitate regional development objectives and to rationalise the provision of \ntourism in order to ensure that the strategic objectives of destinations are achieved. Tourism \nmarketing should also ensure equitable returns-on-resources-utilised for the production and \ndelivery of tourism products, as well as the regeneration of these resources. It should also provide \nsuitable gains to all stakeholders involved in the tourism system. Hence, marketing should be used \nas a strategic mechanism in co-ordination with planning and management rather than a sales tool.  \nDestinations may also involve de-marketing, i.e. the discouragement of certain market segments \nfrom visiting the destination during certain periods, through a range of prohibitive measures or by \ncharging premium prices. Examples of these techniques include:  \n\u0001 visitor management techniques in theme parks which divert people from congested attractions \nto less busy ones by using a leading story\/attraction;  \n\u0001 towns like Cambridge, which aims to attract only visitors who stay overnight and to discourage \nexcursionists who contribute little to the local economy by controlling their parking processes;  \n\u0001 Mauritius which provides high quality resort accommodation and does not allow charter flights, \ntherefore promoting high expenditure tourism; or  \n\u0001 Venice, which deters more visitors by charging premium prices for all services offered and \nrecently initiated negative advertisement to reduce mass tourism.  \nIn this way marketing is used as a mechanism to achieve strategic objectives of destination regions \nand thus, should be guided by the policies for regional development. \nInterests & \nbenefits \n----------------------- \nResponsibilities \nTourism \nEnterprises \nand SMTEs \nTour \nOperators \nPublic \nSector and \ngovernment \nTourists \nHost \npopulation \n54 Main markets and destination choice \n \nUnderstanding destination types and characteristics is of paramount importance for its marketing. \nEach destination can only match certain types of demand and hence tourism marketers need to \nappreciate travel motivations in order to develop appropriate offerings and brand destinations for \nthe right target markets. In addition, destinations should be aware not only of the needs and wants \nof the active demand but also of the potential markets they can attract. It can then develop a \nproduct portfolio, which will enable the optimisation of benefits and adapt their marketing mix to \ntheir target markets (McKercher,1995, Tribe,1997). Consumer behaviour studies indicate that a \nwide range of criteria is used to select tourism products. These criteria are altered according to the \npurpose and features of the trip, elements of the external environment, the characteristics of the \ntraveller and the particularities and attributes of destinations. Several analysts have examined \ntourism consumer behaviour in detail (Gilbert, 1991 and 1993; Swarbrooke and Horner, 1999; \nGoodall, 1988 and 1991; Kent,1991; Mansfeld,1995; Mayo and Jarvis, 1981; Sirakaya et al, 1996; \nMazanec, 1989; Mazanec, and Zins, 1994; Moutinho, 1987, Ryan, 1997, Woodside, and Lysonski, \n1989). \n \nClassifying travel behavior and segmentation becomes increasingly more difficult as modern travelers \ncombine pleasure with business, in order to take time and cost advantage. There are therefore \nendless variations between the two principle classifications of travel activities, i.e. business and leisure \ntrips. However, leisure trips may include elements, characteristics and motivations of business travel \nand vice versa. Incentive travelling, extended conference stays and business meetings during leisure \ntravel makes the distinction between the two categories increasingly blurred. Nevertheless the two \nprinciple categories are fairly identifiable and they are treated differently in this text for simplifying the \nconcepts and marketing responses. \n \nBusiness trips are fairly inflexible and it is often difficult for travelers to select their destinations. \nBusiness travel, often referred to as MICE (Meetings-Incentives-Conferences-Exhibitions), is normally \ndetermined by business opportunities and involvement of the traveler with organisations at the \ndestination. Perhaps more flexibility can be exercised by travelers attending optional meetings, which \nprovide benefits but are not strictly essential to their business such as conferences, exhibitions, \nincentives, familiarization trips etc (Davidson 1994). Even though business tourism is much more \nrestricted in terms of choice, destinations providing a high degree of efficiency and safety, as well as \nelegance and leisure opportunities tend to be preferred for conferences and incentive travel. Business \ntravel is seasonal, as people do not generally travel less during the holiday seasons, i.e. summer \nmonths and public holidays. Nevertheless, business tourism provide much higher revenue for \nenterprises as consumers are willing to pay more for their inflexible schedules and also destinations \ncan increase their multiplier effects as some particular forms of business tourism use a much greater \nspectrum of local services than leisure tourism. Convenient transportation connections with major \ncities around the world, smooth arrangements at the destination and adequate provision of business \nrelated amenities are therefore very important. Urban destinations in developed countries with strong \neconomic activity and vibrant markets tend to receive the majority of business traffic, as a result of the \nbusiness meetings taking place locally. The location of meeting partners, host organisations, as well \nas company policy may determine the selection of destinations for business travel. In addition, \ncorporate rates, membership of loyalty clubs (i.e. frequent flyer or frequent guest) as well as the \navailability of service providers are some additional criteria used to identify suitable destinations and \nservice providers for the MICE market (O\u2019Brien,1998, BTA,1999;Vlitos-Rowe, 1994). \n \nLeisure travelers, on the other hand, use a much more complex set of criteria in selecting their \ndestination. They have a much higher price elasticity and therefore, price is a key element in the \ndecision making process (Gilbert, 1991 and 1993; Swarbrooke and Horner, 1999; Goodall, 1988 and \n1991; Mayo and Jarvis, 1981). In addition, leisure travelers are often time sensitive as families with \nchildren cannot travel during school time, creating the seasonality problem for the industry. However, \ndifferent market segments have dissimilar seasonality patterns. For example, pensioners and elderly \npeople tend to travel during the low season to benefit from discounts, whilst Scandinavian tourists \ntend to stay home during the summer months in order to enjoy the whether. School children and \n6University students go on field research trips or excursions during the low season. Therefore, \ndestinations have to identify the seasonality patterns of their various markets and attract compatible \nsegments, which will enable them to maximise their total yield (both average expenditure and \noccupancy levels) (O\u2019Brien, 1996). It is also important to understand other factors that influence the \ndecision of consumers to purchase. The social status and peer groups of consumers often influence \nwhat is acceptable and desirable as a destination. Travel intermediaries also play a significant role in \ndetermining the destination decision of consumers by using a wide range of promotional techniques \nand often channeling travelers to destinations and principals who offer higher remuneration for them. \nThis will also enable destinations to manage their resources according and attract the right market \nsegments in order to optimize their impacts.  \n \nNevertheless for both leisure and business markets, perhaps the most important criterion for selecting \nto visit or not to visit a destination is its image. Image is the set of expectations and perceptions a \nprospective traveler has of a destination. Past experience of the destination or the companies involved \n(i.e. airlines, hotels, tour operators); descriptions by friends and relatives; general information; and \nmarketing campaigns develop these expectations and perception which may be true or imaginary \nrepresentations. (Baloglu and Brinberg, 1997; Chon,1991 and 1992; Chacko, 1997). Interestingly, \nthe sustainability of local resources becomes one of the most important elements of destination \nimage, as a growing section of the market is not prepared to tolerate over-developed tourism \ndestinations and diverts to more environmentally advanced regions. The degree of consumer \nsatisfaction will depend on the assessment of the perceived overall experience of the destination \nversus anticipated expectations and perceptions. Developing the right image for destinations will \ntherefore determine their ability to satisfy visitors as it will allow them to develop realistic and fulfil-able \nexpectations (Morgan and Pritchard, 1998; Seaton,1997;Pearce,1997).  \n \n5. Types of destinations, target markets and marketing strategies required \n \nDeveloping a destination typology is a difficult task, as different visitors use destinations for \ndifferent purposes. Nevertheless most destinations can be classified in several categories which \nrepresent their principle attractiveness, as illustrated in Table 3. Understanding and appreciating \nthe type of destination enables marketers to develop a suitable destination marketing mixes and \ndeliver them to the appropriate target markets. \n \nUrban destinations have been involved in tourism since the early years of the civilisation. People \nused to travel to cities and towns to meet politicians and business associates. Sports \norganisations, such as the Olympic Games in ancient Greece also generated tourism activity in \nmain cities. People also travelled to cities on pilgrimage for religious purposes, as this is where all \nmajor cathedrals, mosques and temples were usually located. Urban destinations have also been \nattracting business travellers attending meetings, conferences and exhibitions. Most urban \ndestinations are well equipped with conference and exhibition halls and transportation and \naccommodation infrastructure to facilitate the organisation of larger events. Urban destinations also \nattract leisure travellers, especially during periods of low business travelling activity, such as \nweekends and school holidays. Suppliers and facilities aim to reduce seasonality by developing the \nnumber of leisure visitors, despite the fact that they can only charge a fraction of the price they \ncharge business travellers. On the other hand, leisure travellers can take advantage of some of the \nunique facilities and services of urban destinations to enjoy short-breaks or extended weekends. \nLondon for example provides a wide range of heritage attractions as well as a wide range of \nentertainment opportunities such as theatre, concerts, bars, theme restaurants, discos etc. \nBarcelona offers excellent conference facilities, combined with a culturally interesting and relaxed \natmosphere. New York is highly regarded for shopping, sight seeing and theatre going. Urban \ndestinations also attract education and health tourists, as they are generally equipped with good \neducational establishments and hospitals. Increasingly urban resorts take advantage of their \nindustrial heritage and use obsolete industrial sites as educational experiences and leisure \nfacilities. The Docklands in Liverpool and coal mines in Skipton are good examples of these \nfacilities (Berg, et al, 1995, Law, 1996, and 1993, Page, 1994; Mazanec, 1997). \n \n7Table 3: Types of destinations-Main target markets and activities undertaken \nType of \nDestination  \nCustomers Activities \nBusiness-MICE Meetings-Incentives-Conference-Exhibitions \nEducation-Religion-Health \nUrban \n \nLeisure Sightseeing-Shopping-Shows-Short breaks \nBusiness-MICE Meetings-Incentives-Conference-Exhibitions Seaside \nLeisure Sea-Sun-Sand-Sex-Sports \nBusiness-MICE Meetings-Incentives-Conference-Exhibitions Alpine \nLeisure Ski-Mountain Sports-Health- \nBusiness-MICE Meetings-Incentives-Conference-Exhibitions Rural \nLeisure Relaxation-Agriculture-Learning activities-Sports \nBusiness-MICE Exploring business opportunities-Incentives Authentic \nThird World Leisure Adventure-Authentic-Charities-Special interest \nBusiness-MICE Meetings-Incentives-Retreats Unique-Exotic- \nExclusive Leisure Special occasion-Honeymoon-Anniversary \nSeaside destinations and resorts traditionally serve tourists on holidays. Travellers from \nNorthern regions and climates tend to spend a proportion of their annual holiday in the South \nwhere they can enjoy sunshine as well as sea sports. Seaside resorts nearby the place of \nresidence were replaced by international destinations as a result of the emergence of mass \ntourism since the 1970s. For example, in the UK traditional resorts such Blackpool, Scarborough, \nBournemouth and Brighton were replaced by the Spanish Costas through the development of \npackage holidays. Typically European leisure travellers will take their annual holiday at \nMediterranean seaside resorts, whilst Northern Americans visit Southern regions such as Florida, \nCalifornia and the Caribbean. As the product in traditional seaside resorts matures, new long haul \nand exotic destinations, often in less developed countries attract sophisticated travellers who are \nlooking for authentic and off-the-track experiences. The globalisation experienced reduces \ndistances and enables people to travel further afield. Examples include destinations such as Goa \nand Bali which take advantage of developments in transportation and attract travellers. Examples \nof seaside destinations and resorts can be identified globally (see for example Jenner, and Smith, \n1993; Gayle and Goodrich, 1993; Lockhart and Drakakis-Smith, 1997; Morgan,1995; Briguglio, \nArcher, et al, 1996; Brigulio, Butler, et al, 1996; Shaw and Williams, 1997; Conlin, and Baum, 1995; \nTowner and Newton, 1996). \n \nAlpine destinations attract leisure travellers for winter sports, such as skiing, as well as \nholidaymakers who appreciate natural attractions in all seasons. They also attract activity \nholidaymakers such as naturalists, mountain cyclists, walkers etc. Although the majority of alpine \nsports are for recreational purposes a wide range of expeditions and challenges are organised for \nmountains such as the Everest or the Alps. Lakes may also offer facilities for sea sports such as \nsurfing and skiing. Although the majority of alpine resorts are in near proximity to urban centres \nand thus can easily be accessed by private car, several are still unexplored and offer authentic \nexperiences for travellers. Lakes and scenic landscapes make alpine resorts increasingly more \npopular for conference and incentive tourists and thus a certain business travelling activity can be \nobserved in the last few years. The development of important business, political and economic \nmeetings, such as the Davos Forum, attract a new market segment and expand the season for \nwinter resorts. As a result a wide range of marketing and planning implications emerge to allow \nalpine areas to benefit from tourism and yet to ensure the sustainability of their resources \n(Johnston and Edwards, 1994; Weiermair, 1993; Khan, 1994). \nRural tourism is also developing rapidly. Farmers and rural populations take advantage of the \ndesire of travellers to go back to nature and experience some authentic agricultural processes. \nHence agricultural facilities are often transformed to leisure activities. Tourism is regarded as a \ndevelopment tool for several regions where their agriculture declines steadily or where people \nwould like to diversify their living and working patterns. Tourists can stay in rural areas and \ncontribute to agricultural activities taking place or assume a more passive role. There is an \n8educational element to this activity particularly for children from urban centres who may have never \nexperience agricultural life. Rural tourism can also be themed according to the activities \nundertaken, such as cooking or bee-keeping schools organised in rural regions. Examples of this \nform of tourism can be identified globally (Page and Getz, 1997, Sharpley and Sharpley, 1997 \nOppermann, 1996). \n \nDestinations in authentic (often Third World) countries are often off the beaten track. Tourists \nenjoy authentic experiences in places which have experienced limited tourism development. \nEmerging destinations in Asia, South America and Africa attract a small number of adventurous \ntourists who are prepared to forego their comfort in order to interact with local communities and \nunspoiled surroundings. Although these regions may develop at a later stage to mass tourism \ndestinations, they need to be planned properly in order to sustain their resources. They often lack \nthe required infrastructure to deliver tourism services (Silver,1993; Hughes, 1995; Sofield, 1991). \n \nFinally certain destinations are branded unique-exotic-exclusive as they are regarded to offer a \nunique and precious experience. As a result, these destinations are promoted as \u201cone-in-a-life-\ntime\u201d experience and they are promoted premium prices. Examples include Bhutan, Mauritius, and \nSeychelles. In some destinations, there are several mechanisms controlling the number of visitors, \noften through managing their transportation and accommodating capacity or immigration \nprocedures and visa allowances. These destinations focus on the non-charter and non-mass \ntraveller reducing their visitation but maximising their income per visitor. They often epitomise the \ndream of the average traveller and thus are packaged and priced as prestigious products, for \ninstance for weddings, honeymoons, anniversaries or a special occasion trip, or for incentive \ntravel. \n \n6. Marketing research: identifying market segments for destination products \n \nMarketing research is used extensively by destination marketers to identify the types of customers \nthat can be attracted (active demand), as well as the prospective visitors (suppressed demand) \nwho do not visit for a variety of reasons (Athiyaman, 1997). Approaching the right target market \nand providing the most appropriate combination of local tourism products and services is the secret \nfor successful destinations. Product design and formulation should therefore be based on research \n(Baker et al, 1994; Ritchie, 1996, Calantone and Mazanec, 1991;Hu and Ritchie,1993). As tourism \nbundles are formulated ad-hoc to satisfy specific consumer requests, a dynamic marketing \nresearch process will enable destinations to provide unique products by initiating local partnerships \nbetween all suppliers to address the needs of demand. Destination image is also developed \nthrough marketing research, which guides promotional activities towards branding and amending \nthe brand values of the region. The effectiveness of promotional campaigns can be assessed so \nthat the most cost-effective media is used to approach and persuade target markets to visit the \ndestination (Woodside, 1990). Table 4 illustrates the contribution of marketing research to \ndestination marketing. \n \nTable 4: Contribution of marketing research to destination marketing \n \n\u0001 Identification of the main attributes anticipated by each market segment \n\u0001 Design and attributes required for tourism products and services \n\u0001 Evaluation and development of destination image \n\u0001 Segmentation of market and development of corresponding marketing mixes \n\u0001 Opening new markets and reducing dependency on existing ones \n\u0001 Evaluation of the elasticity of demand for each market segment \n\u0001 Reduction of seasonality by matching market segments \n\u0001 Examination of reasons deterring people (suppressed demand) from visiting destinations \n\u0001 Assessment of compatibility with other target markets \n\u0001 Examination of alternative distribution channels \n\u0001 Assessment of tourism impacts to the destination and selecting the right segments \n\u0001 Evaluation of marketing effectiveness and selection of media for promotion \n9Source: Adapted from Baker et al, 1994; Ritchie, 1996; Calantone and Mazanec, 1991. \n \nMarketing research should not be limited to before visitation investigations. As tourism demand is \nextremely dynamic, marketing research needs to follow constant developments to ensure that all \nelements of the destination marketing mix evolve continuously. Surveys during and after visitation \nenable destinations to identify weaknesses and concentrate their corrective action. Data is often \ncollected by frontier controls, airports and transport authorities, national statistics offices, local \ncouncils, tax offices as well as principals such as hotels, travel agencies etc. The effectiveness of \nmarketing research in destinations will depend on their ability to co-ordinate the research activities \nundertaken by the entire range of local authorities and organisations. It is therefore very important \nto co-ordinate all these surveys and data in order to produce meaningful inferences to inform and \nguide tourism policy and marketing strategies (March, 1994; Hawes et al, 1991). \n \n7. Marketing destinations: strategies and practices \n \nDeveloping a marketing strategy and mix for destinations is a complex process, mainly because \nthere are many independent stakeholders and principals involved. Destinations cannot be \nmanaged or marketed as enterprises, due to the dynamics of interests and benefits sought by \nstakeholders. In addition, most destinations are amalgams of independent SMTEs, which already \nfollow their own marketing strategies. Although DMOs have traditionally taken marketing \nresponsibility for the destination product, they fail to control marketing activities and mixes of \nindividual players and hence can only co-ordinate and guide, rather than undertake a \ncomprehensive marketing strategy. Perhaps the most important challenge for destination \nmarketing therefore is to bring all individual partners together to compete rather than to co-operate \nand to pool resources towards developing an integrated marketing mix and delivery system \n(Buhalis and Cooper,1998; Fayos-Sola, 1996). \n \nThe international tourist industry is becoming an increasingly competitive marketplace where only \nthe best-managed destinations are likely to prosper. Comprehensive strategic business plans \ntherefore need to address all factors that have an impact on the product. Tourism strategies should \nnot only concentrate on visitation, but also include the entire range of impacts such as \novercrowding, environmental problems, visitor safety and security, seasonality problems, and \nsensitivity to local culture (Evans, et al 1995). This will enable destinations to develop \ncomprehensive strategies to fulfil all strategic objectives illustrated in Table 2. \n \n7.1 The position of destinations and their marketing \nPerhaps one additional complication to tourism marketing is that in most cases destinations have \nalready a rich history and legacy development which needs to be taken into consideration when \ndeveloping tourism marketing strategies. Not only consumers develop certain images and views \nabout places, but also previous development often provides several limits for marketing to address \nas well as stakeholders who need to be respected and consulted. Understanding therefore the stage \nand roots of tourism development is critical for development a strategy. One of the most widely used \ntools for undertaking this task is the destination life cycle (Butler, 1980). The main utility of the \ndestination life cycle is to facilitate the understanding the evolution of tourist products and \ndestinations and it to provide guidance for strategic decision taking. Cooper (1989, 1992 and 1994) \nsuggests that the life cycle concept illustrates that destinations experience a \u201cbirth to death\u201d cycle \nand that the life cycle model has gained attention in tourism and hospitality as an explanatory tool. \nAlthough in tourism life cycle analysis is often seen as a useful conceptualisation tool for \ndestination area development, in hospitality management it is beginning to be used as a guide for \nstrategic planning. However the main problems relate to identifying turning points, stages, length of \nstages and level of aggregation. Despite the many criticisms of the life cycle concept, it is quite \ncritical for marketers to appreciate the stage of development of resort areas (Haywood, 1986). A \nnumber of researchers have used the cycle as a framework for analysing changing destinations \n10\n(Agarwal, 1997; Shaw and Williams,1997; Formica and Uysal, 1996; Tooman, 1997; Douglas, \n1997; Choy, 1992; Getz, 1992; Ahmed and Krohn,1990; Cooper and Jackson, 1989).  \n \nBased on the above literature, Figure 2 synthesises the different stages destinations are going \nthrough during their life cycle and illustrates how that effects their tourism impacts. This also \nillustrates that different stages of the life cycle require different marketing strategies and planning \nactions. This is largely due to the differences between demand and supply experienced at different \nlevels. In the early stages demand exceeds supply whilst this relationship is reversed in the maturity \nand consolidation stages. As a result, marketing strategies should focus on building awareness and \npromoting the destination product on the early stages of the circle while they probably have to deal \nwith image alteration and re-design and re-launch the product at the later stages. The entire \nmarketing mix therefore will need to be differentiated to accommodate the needs of destinations at \neach stage of their life cycle. In addition, Figure 2 highlights that destinations experience different \nenvironmental and socio-cultural impacts during the different faces. As a result they need to use \nmarketing to encourage sustainable practices for both consumers and industry as well as to \ncommunicate their environmental and socio-cultural policies.  \n11\nFigure 2: Destination life cycle and tourism impacts \nImpacts Analysis  \n \nIntroducti\non \nGrowth  Maturity Saturation Decline \n \nLife Cycle \n \nSupply \n \nDemand \nSITUATION \n \nNew trendy \ndestination \nMore people \ninterested \nInvestment on \naccommodation \n& facilities \nMaximum \nvisitation \nIncreasing \nfacilities \nOversupply, \nOriginal demand \nmoves \nReduction of \ndemand \nSpecial offers to \nboost visitation \nDESTINATION CHARACTERISTICS \nVisitor Number of Tourists Few Many Too Many Many Many \nGrowth rate Low Fast growth Fast growth Slow growth Decline \nAccommodation Capacity Very low Low High Very High Very High \nOccupancy levels Low Very High Very High High Low \nPrices of Services High Very High High  Low Very Low \nExpenditure per capita High Very High Very High Low Very Low \nVisitor types Drifters Innovators Innovators Followers Cheap-mass market \nImage and attractions Low Very High High Low Very Low \nTourists are perceived as  Guests Guests Customers Customers Foreigners \nMARKETING RESPONSE \nMarketing Target Awareness Inform Persuade Persuade Loyalty\/new market \nStrategic Focus Expansion Penetration Defence Defence Reintroduce \nMarketing Expenditure Growing High  High Falling Consolidate \nProduct  Basic Improved Good Deteriorates Decay \nPromotion Introduction Advertising Travel Trade Travel Trade Travel Trade \nPrice High High Lower Low Below cost \nDistribution Independent Independent Travel Trade Travel Trade Travel Trade \nECONOMIC IMPACTS \nEmployment Low High Very High High Low \nForeign Exchange Low Very High Very High High Low \nProfitability of private sector Negative Growing Very High High Decline \nIncome of residents Low Very High Very High Low Very Low \nInvestments Low Very High Very High Low Very Low \nState revenue & Taxes Low Very High Very High Low Very Low \nEconomic Structure  Balanced Tourism oriented Tourism \ndominated \nTourism \nDepended \nUnbalanced and not \nself sufficient \nDependency on intermediaries Negligible Low High Over-dependent Over-dependent \nImports Low Very High  Very High Very High High \nInflation Low Very High  Very High High Low \nSOCIAL IMPACTS \nTypes of tourists Allocentrics Allocentrics Midcentrics Psychocentrics Psychocentrics \nRelationships between locals \nand tourists \nEuphoria Apathy Irritating Antagonism Final \nDemographics at destination Immigrations \nand Older \nresidents \nYouth stays to \nwork in tourism \nMore balanced \nBalanced Balanced Immigrations as no \njobs available and \nOlder residents \nMigration to the destination Low High Very High High Low \nCrime at the destination Low High High Very High Very High \nFamily structure Traditional  Effected Modern Modern Modern \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS \nEnvironment and landscape Unspoilt Improved No respect Polluted Damaged \nConservation and heritage Unspoilt Improved No respect Decay Damaged \nEcological disruption Unspoilt Improved No respect Decay Damaged \nPollution related to tourism Negligible Low High Very High Very High \nWater pollution Negligible Low High Very High Very High \nCongestion and traffic Low Low Very High Very High Low \nErosion Low High Very High Very High Very High \nIt is evident, therefore, that different destinations are affected in a dissimilar pattern on each stage \nof their life cycle and as a consequence they require specific marketing action. For example \nNorthern European coastal resorts have experienced declining visitor numbers and decay which \n12\nhas resulted to alteration of main use of facilities as well as a concentration on few expanding \nmarkets (e.g. senior citizens, conferences and language schools). In contrast, the majority of \ncoastal regions in Southern Europe face a decline of tourism benefits, rather than numbers of \nvisitors as a result of their progression from one stage of the cycle to the next one. Paradoxically in \nmost cases the number of visitors increase mainly due to the price reductions used to stimulate \ndemand. Established mass tourism destinations, such as Benidorm, use a high volume low profit \nmargin strategy to ensure their profitability and they are successful in increasing their visitors. \nHowever unless carefully managed any increase of visitors deteriorates local resources further and \npushes destinations in greater decline, which forces to further price reductions and further quality \ndecrease. This is a vicious circle which eventually makes the purpose and benefit of the entire \ntourism activity at the destination questionable. Clearly therefore resorts will need to take into \nconsideration the phase of development there are in as well as the patterns of destination life cycle \nexperienced in competing destinations and adopt their strategic marketing accordingly. \n \n7.2 Strategic marketing for destinations and strengthening their competitiveness \nCompetitive strategy \"is the search for a favourable competitive position in an industry\". This is a \nfunction of both the attractiveness of the industry and the relative competitive position within that \nparticular industry, as well as alternative activities that an organisation can undertake. \"Competitive \nstrategy aims to establish a profitable and sustainable position against the forces that determine \nindustry competition\" (Porter,1985). Competitiveness is, therefore, defined here as the effort and \nachievement of long term profitability, above the average of the particular industry within which they \noperate as well as above alternative investment opportunities in other industries. This definition \nincludes therefore the concept of opportunity cost and illustrates that successful organisations should \nnot only compete within their particular industry but also against other investment opportunities. \nWhen referring to tourism destinations competitiveness should also include the sustainability of local \nresources for ensuring the maintenance of long term success as well as the achievement of \nequitable returns-on-resources utilised to satisfy all stakeholders. \n \nThere is little written about the competitiveness of tourism destinations. Bordas (1994a and 1994b) \nhas developed several frameworks which determine destination competitiveness. They are based on \ndemand and supply as well as a wide range of factors influenced by the external environment of the \ndestination. Ritchie and Crouch (1993) have developed a comprehensive model for tourism \norganisations, as illustrated in Figure 3, which can be analysed further to include the entire range of \nfactors affecting the competitiveness of destinations.  \n \nFigure 3: Ritchie and Crouch model for tourism destination competitiveness \nDestination prosperity = fn Competitiveness (Sector 1, Sector 2, tourism\u2026) \nTourism  Competitiveness = \n Fn {destination appeal (attractiveness and deterrents)} \n {destination management (marketing and managerial efforts)} \n {destination organisation (DMO capabilities, strategic alliances \n {destination information (internal management information system,  \n research capabilities)} \n {destination efficiency (integrity of experience, productivity) \nSource: Adapted from Ritchie and Crouch, 1993. \n \nThe framework explains that the prosperity of destination depends on the competitiveness of all \neconomic sectors as well as the competitiveness of tourism. A further analysis illustrates the \ncompetitiveness of tourism is a function of several factors related to destination administration. A \nwide range of elements are included in the model illustrating that tourism is affected by an endless \nnumber of factors in its internal and external environment. Although the model fails to rate the \nimportance of each of the elements examined, it is suggested that a dissimilar rating should be \nadopted by different destinations depending on the types of markets they attract, their life cycle stage \nand specific characteristics. Nevertheless the contribution of the Ritchie and Crouch lies on the \ncomprehensiveness and wideness of the elements taken into consideration. The model also \nhighlights that it is the combination of all factors comprising the competitiveness of destinations as \n13\nwell as synergies between these elements that determine the attractiveness of a region. Perhaps \nfuture research will attach ratings to each factor for specific types of destination and also illustrate \npotential tradeoffs that consumers may consider. Consumers may be willing to compromise some \nelements for some others, for example overcrowdness for cheaper price in some Spanish Costas. \nUnderstanding the values and prime aims would be critical for developing the module further. \nUltimately the competitiveness of destinations depends on their ability to maximise their performance \nfor each individual element assessed. \n \n7.3 Strategy formulation for destinations \nThis paper reviews three strategy models, namely Porter's generic strategies, Gilbert's proposition for \n\"differentiation of the destination\" and Poon's analysis for \"flexible specialisation\". The paper then \nsynthesises their propositions in order to propose a generic strategy and illustrate how destinations \nshould develop their offerings.  \n \n7.3.1 Porter\u2019s generic strategies \n \nFigure 4 illustrates the three main strategies proposed by Porter (1980) aimed to \"outperform other \nfirms in an industry\", i.e.:  \n\u0001 Overall cost leadership, where organisations are required to minimise their costs, based on \nmass production and strict cost control of the main business functions;  \n\u0001 differentiation of products or services offered by \"creating something that is perceived industry-\nwide as being unique\";  \n\u0001 focus on a \"particular buyer group, segment of the product line or geographical market\" and \nachieve either cost leadership or product differentiation.  \n \nFigure 4 Porter's three generic strategies \nSTRATEGIC ADVANTAGE \nPerceived product uniqueness Cost advantage \nTARGET \nMARKET \nIndustry \nwide \u2022 Differentiation \u2022 Cost Leadership \nParticular \nsegments \nonly \n\u2022 Differentiation Focus \u2022 Cost Focus \nSource: Adapted from Porter, 1980, p.39. \n \nThis is well-developed generic model, which is widely used to all industries. It provides clear \nguidance for decision makers to position their products in order to maximise profitability and improve \ntheir competitiveness. However, this model fails to address the specific needs of tourism and in \nparticular the scarcity of resources at the destination level. Therefore, similarly with commodities this \nmodel suggests unlimited resources are available to reproduce endless number of products. This is \nparticularly the case for the cost leadership strategy where organisations are urged to increase their \nvolume and to reduce their profit margin. Unfortunately environmental resources, both natural (e.g. \ncoral reefs or mountain landscapes) and man-made (e.g. archaeological sites or architectural \nstructures) have a limited capacity which they can accommodate. Resources in tourism are \nirreplaceable once destroyed and therefore a strategy should ensure that their use is limited to the \ndegree that does not threat their sustainability in the long term. Once this is understood and \nappreciated, Porter\u2019s model enables tourism marketers to focus on differentiation strategies and to \ndevelop their mix accordingly. However, several destinations, which are on the consolidation phase \nof their life cycle, have exceeded the maximum capacity which would have enabled them to sustain \ntheir resources. Their ability to promote differentiated tourism products has also been jeopardised, as \nover-development has exploited and damaged their resources. This is experienced in some mass \ntourism destinations, such as Benidorm and Costa Brava in Spain, or Faliraki and Malia in Greece. \n14\nOnce destinations have reached that stage there is limited choice. The majority try to attract more \nmass tourism so they can increase their profitability through volume. Increasingly however some \nregions aim to renovate their properties and facilities and re-launch their offerings. The Calvia \nexample in Mallorca, which decided to demolish three hotels in order to improve public areas and to \nenhance the quality of its products set new best practices which may be followed by other regions. \n \n7.3.2 Gilbert\u2019s strategic framework \n \nBased on the above rational the second strategic framework introduced by Gilbert (1984 and 1990b) \nargues that destinations can classified on a continuum between a \u201cstatus\u201d and a \u201ccommodity\u201d area, \nas illustrated in Figure 5.. \"Status areas\" achieve intentional demand as a result of the unique \nproduct attributes perceived by the tourism market. These unique attributes may be genuine or \nimaginative and thus, a destination is regarded as irreplaceable, which increases consumers' loyalty \nand willingness to pay. In the \u201ccommodity status\u201d case, destinations are substitutable, very sensitive \nto price and economic changes, while consumers have a low awareness of any unique benefits or \nattributes. Thus, travellers base their decision to visit the area merely on price, while the demand for \nthe destination is incidental and destinations are unable to attract high spenders. Despite the fact that \nthe sustainability of resources is not discussed explicitly by the model, it is quite evident that \u201cstatus \nareas\u201d manage their resources as product attributes and therefore are appreciated by consumers \nwho are willing to pay more. \n \nFigure 5: Gilbert's differentiation strategy \n \nSource: Adapted from Gilbert, 1990, p.25 \n \nGilbert (1990) asserts that destinations should attempt to become \"status areas\", rather than a \n\"commodity area\" one, in order to improve their image, loyalty and economic benefits. It is suggested \nthat destinations should differentiate their tourism products in order to achieve a unique \"tourist \nproduct benefit\". This will enable them to establish their position in the international market, and \nattract both high spenders and loyal tourists, who appreciate the uniqueness of their resources and \nofferings. Although the model clearly differentiates destinations to distinctive categories it fails to \nrecognise that the majority of destinations lay between the two ends of the continuum. It also fails to \nrelate to the different stages of the life cycle and to the inevitability experienced in several regions \nwhere destinations are launched as status areas and gradually slip to commodity status \n(Buhalis,1999a). Nevertheless the model clearly contributes to tourism marketing by correlating \nproduct attributes with willingness to pay and also by illustrating clearly that destinations should \ndecide on what direction they should plan and manage their resources and facilities.  \n \n7.3.3 Poon\u2019s flexible specialisation  \n \nA third strategic approach for tourism is proposed by Poon (1989 and 1993), based on the concept of \n\"flexible specialisation\" of the tourism business. Poon examines the tourism industry processes and \nproposes a strategy to enable tourism organisations to improve their competitiveness. Poon argues \nthat \"flexible specialisation\" is a strategy of \"permanent innovation\" and \"ceaseless change\" which \nprovides for \"new tourism\". New tourism is flexible, segmented, customised to the tourist's needs and \ndiagonally integrated. In contrast, old tourism can be characterised as \"mass, standardised and \nCommodity\nArea \nStatus \narea \nWillingness to \npay higher prices \nStatus \nArea \nProduct attributes Product attributes \nCommodity\nArea \n15\nrigidly packaged\". \"The main sources of flexibility for service firms lie in the organisation, \nmanagement, marketing, distribution and other forms of interaction and interrelationships among \nguests, hotels, suppliers, distributors. What is important however is not each of these stand-alone \naspects but how they are coupled to create competitive advantages and hence, capabilities to move \nwith the market\" (Poon, 1993). This is a timely model, which predicted the impact of information \ntechnology on the both decision making and consumer behaviour. Industry innovation is critical in \nthis strategy and the utilisation of new technology provides the opportunity to customise products \naccording to customers\u2019 specific requirements. Hence destinations can organise their assets and \nattributes in such a way which will enable them to specialise their tourism product according to \nparticular demand needs.  \n \nAlthough Poon\u2019s model revolutionised tourism thinking it is still difficult to implement at the \ndestination level. The majority of infrastructure and superstructure is based on fixed assets, which \ncannot be altered easily and therefore they have a limited degree of flexibility. This is more evident at \ndestinations at the consolidation stages, which are unable to reinvent themselves and approach new \nmarkets. Nevertheless, the model clearly contributes to the field by encouraging tourism \norganisations and destinations to challenge existing strategies and practices and to forcing them to \napproach new tourism with new tools introduced by technology. Concentrating on core functions and \noutsourcing all peripheral activities to networks of virtual co-operations should enable destinations \nand enterprises to innovate and to adapt to the needs of consumers constantly. \n \n7.3.4 Synthesis of strategic frameworks and lessons for strategic destination marketing \n \nThe discussion of the three models provides several interesting lessons. A close examination of \nstrategies reveals that they share a similar base. Porter's \"differentiation\", Gilbert's \"status area\" and \nPoon's \"flexible specialisation\" describe how firms and destinations can achieve value competitive \nadvantages. Consumers appreciate special attributes and values and as a result they are inclined to \nvisit areas more regularly, to increase their loyalty and to pay higher prices. In contrast, \"cost \nleadership\", \"commodity area\" and \"standardisation or the \u201cFordism production model\" describe the \nefforts of firms or destinations to achieve \"cost competitive advantage\" by offering their products for \nless than their competitors. This is achieved through economies of scale, standardisation and mass \nproduction. Destinations and tourism products are treated as commodities and decisions are merely \nbased on price. Hence the underlying concept of the two alternative strategies is the relationship \nbetween volume and price. The first set of strategies supports a \"low volume-high profit margin\" \napproach, where each consumer is paying premium prices for unique products, whilst the second set \nof strategies follows a \"high volume-low profit margin\" approach. \n \nTourism destinations should avoid the cost advantage strategies as they are based on mass \nproduction and consumption and assume unlimited production capacity and resources. The \ninseparability of the tourism product determines that consumers should be present at the time of \nproduct delivery. Therefore, the interaction of consumers with socio-cultural and environmental \nscarce resources can decay the very reasons, which attract people to places. Seasonality also \ngenerates demand peaks and inflates the problem during certain periods every year. Although \neconomic benefits can also be achieved by using the \"commodity area\" or the \"standard product \nmodel\", it is argued that on the long term these approaches reduce tourist satisfaction, consumer \nwillingness to pay, and are against demand trends. In addition, the \"high volume-low profit margins\" \nstrategy has catastrophic social and environmental impacts on destinations. As a result, not only their \nsustainability may be jeopardised but also the competitiveness of the region as a whole. Effectively \nthese strategies push destinations through their life cycle stages and force them to reach their \nconsolidation stage. Destinations therefore should define and not exceed their carrying capacities in \norder to sustain their resources and at the same avoid jeopardising consumers satisfaction. \n \nThis is reflected on both Gilbert and Poon\u2019s strategies which agree that destinations should aim to \nachieve a \"status area\" or \u201cniche\u201d orientation through differentiation, in order to increase consumer \nsatisfaction as well as to maximise the benefits for tourism regions. This strategy is already adopted \nin several resort areas, such as Valencia in Spain, where it is recognised that the need for \ndiversification and differentiation \"has now become essential owing to the level of competitiveness \n16\nthat has been attained (and can be foreseen) in the world tourist market\" (Fayos-Sola, 1992). It is \nalso particularly useful for insular, peripheral and remote destinations, where a limited number of \neconomic and financial resources are available. However, this strategy should not serve as an \nexcuse for principals at destinations for not improving their efficiency and minimising their production \ncosts. Although providing unique service to satisfy tourist needs should be their priority, offering \nperceived value for money would determine their competitiveness in the marketplace (Murphy and \nPritchard, 1997). As most destinations consist of networks of tourism suppliers and principals, there \nis much overlapping between the strategic orientation followed at the macro and micro level. Hence a \nclose collaboration between the private and public sector is required. Destinations and enterprises \nfollowing a \"status area\" strategy would probably enhance tourists' satisfaction, as well as their \ncompetitiveness. The formulation of unique and customised products by using flexibility and co-\noperation will also increase tourists' willingness to pay and their loyalty, while responding to new \ntourism demand trends.  \n \nUnfortunately, some destinations can no longer be positioned as irreplaceable unique products, due \nto over-development and degradation of their resources. Tourism supply has exceeded their carrying \ncapacity and they have reached the saturation or decline phases of their life cycle. For example \nseveral Mediterranean \"costas\" have been overdeveloped to such an extent that only a high-volume, \nlow-profit margin orientation is feasible. When resorts reach their saturation level only a \"cost \nleadership\" or \"mass production\" strategy can be employed, as they are unable to provide any \nspecific \"tourist product benefit\". The attraction of the lower end of the market is inevitable and as a \nconsequence, there are no alternative strategies. In this case the minimisation of further social and \nenvironmental damages as well as attempts to improve the surrounding environment should also be \nthe primary objective.  \n \nIn addition, a re-positioning of the product can also be attempted although it is quite difficult to alter \nthe image of destinations. For example the Calvia Municipality in Mallorca has implemented a \ndynamic plan for enhancing the quality of the tourism offering through the enhancement of the \nlandscape and the regeneration of environmental resources. As a result, intentional demand has \nincreased and a higher willingness to pay is experienced, increasing the profitability of the private \nsector and boosting the economic impacts of tourism. Another successful example of destination \nmanagement and marketing is also Las Vegas. Although it has not yet on the maturity level, the local \nindustry constantly undertakes initiatives to reinvent and reposition itself. They diversified their target \nmarkets by developing theme parks within major hotels in order to attract families and young \nchildren. Several new hotels open every year while older properties are being renovated, often by \ndemolishing properties and rebuilding them. The \u201cold strip\u201d was also relaunched to attract visitors \nfrom the new hotels and casinos. \n \n8 Destination marketing mix \n \nOnce a tourism management and marketing strategy has been decided destinations will have to \ndevelop their marketing mix. This will enable them to approach each target market with a \ncomprehensive range of offerings and to propose an integrated solution to consumer needs and \nwants. Developing a marketing mix for destinations will depend on each destination, the types of \ntarget markets and a whole range of issues on the external environment. Nevertheless some \nprinciples need to be addressed and the following text illustrates examples and frameworks which \ncan assist destination marketers to decide on the most appropriate marketing mixes.  \n \n8.1 Formulating the destination product \n \nDestinations are amalgams of individually produced tourism amenities and services \n(accommodation, transportation, catering, entertainment etc) and a wide range of public goods \n(such as landscape, scenery, sea, lakes, socio-cultural surroundings, atmosphere etc). All these \nelements are branded together under the name of the destination. The ubiquity of the destination \nconcept effectively means that the tourism product for each prospective traveller is very subjective \nand depends heavily on his\/her image and expectations of the place. Nevertheless, the tourism \nproduct for a region consists of the entire range of facilities and services offered locally, plus all \n17\nsocio-cultural, environmental resources and public goods. Understanding the core product as well \nas the facilitating, supportive and augmented products for each target market is of paramount \nimportance for destination marketing. The augmented environment will include intangible elements \nsuch as interaction and customer participation as well as accessibility and physical environment \n(Kotler et al,1996,p.276) \n \nDMOs have an overall responsibility for the entire destination product and through incentives and \npolicies facilitate the development of products, which is desirable from the demand side, and at the \nsame time does not jeopardise local resources. DMOs should therefore be the guardians of the \nimage and resources of destinations. However, throughout the world tourism services are offered \nby small and medium tourism enterprises (SMTEs) which tend to be family managed. The \nchallenge for destination management organisations is therefore to provide leadership in the \ndevelopment of innovative products and create local partnerships for the delivery of seamless \nexperiences. These partnerships should bring together both private and public sector and should \nensure that the long term competitiveness of the tourism product prevails all decision making \nprocesses (Buhalis and Cooper,1998).  \n \nDMOs also need to enhance and differentiate their products by emphasising their \nuniqueness. Destination marketers often adopt a mass tourism orientation, because they falsely \nbelieve that tourism products can grow indefinitely. Hence, generic characteristics of destinations \nare frequently emphasised in all marketing campaigns as they attempt to attract too many target \nmarkets. Sun and sea dominate the promotion of Mediterranean destinations; exotic surroundings \nare emphasised for long haul destinations and skiing is offered by Alpine resorts. However, it is \nincreasingly evident that new-sophisticated consumers seek authentic and unique experiences. \nThey are also willing to pay a premium, but only if the product is significantly better than that of \ncompetitors. Hence, destinations will need to re-assess the entire range of their resources and \nidentify suitable tourism products for each particular target market segment.  \n \nThemed or alternative tourism enables destinations to provide unique experiences. For example, \nGreece could concentrate on its heritage and history and offer ancient\/mythology experiences; Italy \ncan develop culture\/art\/design\/fashion\/cuisine themes; Romania should explore the Dracula myth; \nand Bali should concentrate on the unique religious rituals and cultural traditions. Natural, \nagricultural, cultural, artistic, heritage, resources of destinations can be used accordingly. Tourism \nshould also contribute to the preservation of these resources by increasing the awareness of both \nlocals and visitors and by providing funds for the conservation and regeneration of resources. \nAttracting appropriate target market segments should also assist the reduction of seasonality, as \nspecial theme offerings, as well as festivals and events should enable destinations to increase their \ndemand during the low season. For example, the renovation of physical features and natural \nresources on Mallorca, or the development of innovative new products such as Festivals and \nthemed experiences (e.g. Edinburgh New Year\u2019s Eve and summer festivals) also enable \ndestinations to manage their product life cycle effectively. The aim is to maintain the destination to \nthe maturity\/consolidation stages and to avoid the stagnation, saturation and decline stages in their \nlife cycle. \n \n8.2 Pricing the destination \n \nA wide range of pricing techniques are applicable to tourism destinations (Meidan, 1995; Kotler et \nal,1996). However, pricing is a difficult process for destinations as it is often determined by the \npricing and marketing policies of individual enterprises both at the destination and distributors at \nthe place of origin. Local suppliers can have their own policy and thus co-ordinating and \nestablishing a destination wide pricing strategy is almost unachievable. Furthermore, national \neconomic policies and economic conditions in the international marketplace also influence pricing. \nTherefore, both macro- and micro- economics determine the pricing function of tourism \norganisations locally and destinations. The cost of living and employment, as well as inflation, \nexchange rates and local efficiency and competition all contribute to the pricing equation. Tourism \nin Japan is inevitably much more expensive than tourism in Indonesia due to the differences \nbetween the two economies. Macroeconomic changes have great influence on the pricing of \n18\ndestination and the attraction of consumers. For instance, the depreciation of the Spanish Peseta \nand the Greek Drachma as well as the high inflation rate of the Turkish Lira have all determined \nthe pricing of their destinations and have influenced their competitiveness (Edwards, 1993).  \n \nPricing the destination and all the individual elements of the local tourism product is a very complex \nprocess. Principals tend to have their own pricing mix and policies. DMOs can control elements of \npricing through regulation, advice and through partnerships with the private sector. However, \nDMOs often provide guidelines by suggesting minimum prices to protect small suppliers from fierce \ncompetition and maximum prices to protect consumers from overcharging. For example, in several \ndestinations the public sector determines the lowest price per category for accommodation, \nadvises on the retail price of consumer goods and foods, set the maximum prices for transportation \nor taxi services. Although enforcing pricing policies is extremely difficult, destination managers \nshould formulate partnerships with principals and train them on the importance of maintaining a \nfairly standardised pricing structure and policy.  \n \nIn several leisure destinations tour operators also play a critical role in determining the price \nconsumers pay for products locally. This is has significant implications for destinations which \ndepend on intermediaries (tour operators) for their clientele, and in particular for destinations which \nhave an oversupply of facilities. Tour operators in Europe and especially the larger\/mass\/integrated \noperators, such as Airtours, Thomson, TUI, and Neckerman, exercise bargaining and coercive \npower because of the large volume of tourists they represent and reduce the prices of principals at \ndestinations. This enables them to offer competitively priced products at their marketplace. \nHowever, as local suppliers may not be able to gain enough profit from the basic product (i.e. \naccommodation and transfers) they may need to overprice other element of the product (i.e. \ncatering, entertainment, local excursions) in order to boost their profitability (Buhalis, 1999b). \n \nThe higher the expenditure of tourists locally the better it is for destinations, as it increases the \nprofitability of local enterprises and enhances the economic benefits. Consumers take into \nconsideration the total cost of a trip, i.e. before, during and after their visit. In most cases they have \nnot visited the destination before they purchase their travel product. Hence pricing plays an \nimportant role in determining the image of destinations. Perhaps the biggest travel expenditure is \ntransport to and from the destination, especially for long haul trips, and thus can determine the \nwillingness and ability of travellers to visit destinations. \n \nDestinations can only charge premium prices if they offer a unique experience. Venice for example \nprofits from its unique product attributes and charges substantially higher prices than other Italian \ndestinations. However, increasingly consumers are unimpressed by tourism facilities and products, \nas they have travelled extensively and have acquired a wealth of experiences. Global competition \nand oversupply, as well as the emergence of new destinations in third world countries with lower \nlabour costs, generate frequent price wars especially for constrained capacity at the last minute. As \na result, consumer are increasingly prepared to pay less for getting more. Nevertheless, it is \nimportant for consumers to perceive prices as fair and good value for money, because \ndissatisfaction damages the competitiveness of the destination. \n \n8.3 Distributing tourism destinations \n \nDistribution or marketing channels are defined as sets of interdependent organisations involved in the \nprocess of making a product or service available for use or consumption. The ultimate objective of \ndistribution channel can be summarised as: delivering the right quality and quantity of a product, in the \nright place, at the right time, at the right cost, to the right customer. Several important distribution and \nmarketing functions performed by channel members, such as: carrying of inventory; demand \ngeneration through promotion; market information collection and analysis; negotiation between channel \nmembers and consumers; physical possession and distribution; risk taking; payment and financial \narrangements; and after-sale service. Distribution is emerging as a critical element of strategic \nmanagement and as one of the few remaining sources of real competitive advantage. Apart from \ninfluencing costs, increasingly distribution channels also support and enable product differentiation by \n19\nadding value on the product and by contributing to the total brand experience and projecting powerful \nimages \n \nThe entire range of players that bring together tourism demand and supply for a region formulate \nits distribution channel. Distribution of destinations becomes increasingly more important, not only \nbecause it is estimate to cost 20-30% of the product price but also because it determines whether \nand under what conditions suppliers can meet their target markets. This is the case especially in \nthe European leisure market context as concentration has led four major companies to dominate \nthe market. Business travellers have strict schedules and use intermediaries to organise their \nitineraries. In contrast, leisure travellers tend to have much greater flexibility and price elasticity. As \na consequence, intermediaries can influence their decision and choice of destination.  \n \nBusiness travellers can be influenced indirectly by people who are responsible for arranging \nbusiness meetings and conferences. These include corporate travel officers and administrative \nstaff in organisations who choose the location of meetings, as well as services suppliers. For \ndestinations to attract business travellers they need to develop strong links with the local business \nand academic communities as well as with various types of associations. This will enable DMOs to \nappreciate the needs of business travellers and to provide convenient and adequate products. \nOften local associations, chambers, businesses or academics need to be closely involved in order \nto attract and arrange Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) at the \ndestination. Consequently, relationships with business travel agencies as well as conference and \nexhibition organisers are important to attract and satisfy the MICE markets. \n \nLeisure travellers have a much wider choice and flexibility and therefore a different distribution \nstrategy and mix are required. Domestic tourists usually make direct arrangements and often use \ntheir own transport, whereas international leisure travellers tend to be more influenced by \nintermediaries. Representation of destinations in tour operators\u2019 brochures determines their ability \nto attract the appropriate volume and quality of consumers. Leisure travellers often require travel \nagencies advice on selecting appropriate destinations and products. Hence, destinations need to \nprovide travel agencies with information and promotional material, as well as to organise \neducational trips and provide incentives for their staff in order to promote the destination to \nconsumers. Workshops and road shows may also increase awareness and provide positive \nimpressions. Travel trade manuals serve as reference books for intermediaries offering \ncomprehensive information about destination regions. Developing long-term partnerships with tour \noperators and leisure travel agencies is therefore extremely significant for the success of leisure \ndestinations.  \n \nThe concentration of the European tourism industry increases the power of certain integrated travel \norganisations. As a result, they increasingly control more than 70% of the market and can use a \nwide range of marketing techniques to determine consumer choice. Table 5 illustrates the \npenetration of the largest tour operating groups in the European market and clearly demonstrates \nthat leisure movement in Europe is directed to a large extent by a small number of integrated tour \noperators (O\u2019Brien, 1996; Bywater 1992 and 1997). Since then more concentration is experienced \ndaily as operators merge to develop their volume and take advantage from economies of scale and \nnegotiation power. In addition, a wide range of smaller specialised tour operators exists in each \nmarket promoting specialised products.  \n \nTable 5: Penetration of the largest tour operator groups  \nin the European leisure market in 1994\/5 \nCountry Tour Operators Estimated market share \nUnited Kingdom Thomson\/Airtours\/First Choice 58%\nBelgium NUR (Neckerman) 50%\nAustria Touropa\/ITAS\/Ruefa\/Kuoni\/Neckerman 45%\nScandinavia Airtours (Spies, Tjaereborg) 43%\nIreland Budget\/JWT (First Choice) 40%\nGermany TUI\/NUR\/LTT 37%\nNetherlands TUI (Holland International\/Arke) 30%\n20\nFrance Nouvelles Fronti\u00e8res\/Club Med 25%\nSource: Adapted from O\u2019Brien, 1996 and Bywater, 1997 and 1992 \n \nAlthough, there is a concentration on leisure distribution channels, consumers become more \nindependent and sophisticated and use the entire range of tools to arrange their travel. The \navailability of information on the Internet and the emergence of electronic intermediaries \nrevolutionise distribution. Destinations that appreciate the new developments and build \ncomprehensive tools for their local suppliers increasingly improve their ability to reach their \nstrategic objectives. IT enables consumers to seek for information as well as construct and \npurchase individual itineraries on-line, and thus it revolutionised destination marketing. Not only do \nthey provide opportunities for reducing dependency on traditional intermediaries for remote, \nperipheral and insular destinations but they also provide a mechanism to develop and promote \nspecialised products for mini market segments (Buhalis, 1998).  \n \nElectronic distribution also offers opportunities for closer interaction and co-operation at the local \nlevel. In several places where IT has been used extensively, such as Tyrol, Ireland and Singapore, \nan integration of local resources and organisations enables suppliers at the destination level to \ndevelop and deliver seamless tourism products to consumers. Destination Management Systems \nwill need to be developed in order to enable the networking of all local tourism providers as well as \na comprehensive and innovative interface between the destinations and their prospective and \ncurrent clients (Buhalis, 1994 and 1997).  \n \n8.4 Promoting the destination \n \nPromoting destinations essentially implies the development of communicating channels with \nclientele and other stakeholders to increase awareness and persuade to purchase products. \nDestination promotion requires a co-ordinated campaign and message for all local principals and \nsuppliers. Designing a cost-effective promotional mix is difficult because of the diversity of tourism \nsuppliers at destinations and the spread of consumers throughout the world. Achieving a \nconsensus on the marketing campaign as well as raising adequate funds to develop and \nimplement it is one of the most challenging tasks for destination marketing. Traditionally, DMOs \nlead promotional campaigns, whilst suppliers participate and contribute. A wide range of \ntechniques are used, both above and below the line (Kotler, et al,1996; Horner and \nSwarbooke,1996). \n \nAbove the line promotional activity includes advertising on television, radio, and press as well as \nusing poster campaigns. Targeting the right market with the right message at the right time is \nalways difficult, especially for destinations, which attract consumers from several geographical \nregions as well as cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Although very expensive, above the line \nadvertisement can assist the development of the destination brand as well as influence a large \nnumber to visitors to travel to the destination or to extend their visit (Bonham and Mak,1996). \nCrouch (1994) has illustrated that although many countries have substantially increased their \nspending on tourism promotions there is little evidence of their effectiveness as studies which have \nattempted to evaluate the promotional impact empirically have generally produced inconclusive \nand varied results. Nevertheless, DMOs are increasingly being held accountable for generating \nadequate results through advertising and for measuring advertising effectiveness (Woodside, \n1990; Faulkner,1997; Crompton, 1997; Schoenbachler et al, 1995). Advertisements use slogans, \nwhich change frequently in order to follow tourism demand trends and to update the image of \ndestinations (Morgan and Pritchard, 1998). For example, Spain recently changed its slogan from \n\u201ceverything under the sun\u201d to \u201cpassion for life\u201d. This change reflected the refocus of its product \naway from the traditional \u201csun and sea\u201d product to a much more sophisticated offering based on \nsocio-cultural diversity and the life-style of local people (Fayos-Sola,1996).  \n \nIn addition, DMOs often use below the line promotional techniques. They participate in major \nannual tourism and travel fairs in Berlin, London, Milan, Madrid, Paris and elsewhere. There they \nhave the opportunity to meet intermediaries and members of the public to promote their offerings. \nThey produce brochures, which they distribute to all their partners in the industry and to \n21\nprospective consumers who require information on the destination. Brochures normally show local \nattractions and activities, whilst they also feature a number of local suppliers such as hotels, \nentertainment and catering establishments (Wicks and Schuett, 1991, 1993). In addition, travel \ntrade manuals offer information about the destination to the travel trade and provide a reference \nguide.  \n \nAlthough DMOs often operate information offices where they provide information about local \nsuppliers they tend to refrain from selling direct, as they regard themselves as facilitators rather \nthan intermediaries and also avoid to be seen as promoters of individual products and services \nagainst other local suppliers. Instead, when asked by prospective customers they provide contact \ndetails of local suppliers and advise consumers on the ones that are likely to satisfy their demand. \nHowever, increasingly DMOs are forced to play a more active selling role as consumers appreciate \nan one-stop-service. In many destinations they are also required to justify their income or to \ncontribute towards their expenses and hence they charge commissions for local bookings and sell \nmaps, local guidebooks and souvenirs to generate income. Direct marketing is also used as \ndestinations can identify prospective customers and promote elements of the local offerings that \nsatisfy the specific demand. Developing relationship marketing and loyalty clubs enables repeat \nvisitors to be recognised and appreciated. Discount schemes and other add-ones are currently \ndeveloping for several destinations to reward and maintain their loyal clientele.  \n \nFinally, public relations are extensively used for most tourism destinations. Destination \nrepresentatives at national level establish tourism offices in their major markets to distribute \npromotional material and information as well as through their embassies. In addition, public \nrelations are used to generate news stories, articles and publicity in order to develop the \nawareness of consumers and persuade them to purchase the products. Often hosting a journalist \nor a celebrity in the destination can generate more interest than any other forms of promotion \nbecause consumers are more passive receivers than with advertising. Public relations are also \ncritical for the development and updating of the right image (Morgan and Pritchard, 1998; Kotler et \nal,1996; Middleton,1992).  \n \n9. Marketing competitive destinations for the future \n \nDestination marketing is increasingly becoming extremely competitive worldwide. Providing \ninnovative and well co-ordinated tourism products is therefore exceedingly important for tourism \nregions. Consumers assess their travel experience as a whole and they associate destinations with \nthe entire range of local producers and suppliers. Producing innovative and specialised tourism \nproducts will enable destinations to attract intentional demand and to differentiate their products. \nFlexible specialisation will also support local suppliers and the region as a whole to evolve with \nconsumer trends and support the requirements of the emerging sophisticated clientele as well as \ncompete globally. Destinations, which appreciate these principles, can develop and maintain \ncompetitive advantage and as a result achieve their strategic objectives. \n \nPartnerships between the public and private sector and close co-operation between all local \nsuppliers is key to the ability of destinations to offer quality products. Exceeding consumers\u2019 \nexpectations is therefore instrumental for the ability of both suppliers and destinations to attract \nvisitors in the long term. Hence the competitiveness of each supplier locally as well as their \ndistributors determines the competitiveness of destinations. Local suppliers should co-operate \nrather than compete. Buhalis and Cooper (1998) argue that tourism suppliers at destinations need \nto mature and understand that they should not compete with each other at the destination level. \nInstead they should join forces and pool resources to develop and implement comprehensive \nmarketing strategies which enable them to compete with other destinations. The rapid \ndevelopment of new destinations, especially in third world countries generates an unprecedented \nlevel of competition. They can offer unspoiled natural landscapes and authentic socio-cultural \nresources inexpensively. In contrast, most traditional destinations suffer from their own success \nand the lack of a strict rational planning and management system. Having gone through most of \nthe stages of they life cycle they have reached maturity or saturation and this has forced them to \nrely mass tourism for their operations. Often facilities require urgent renovation, but lack of financial \n22\nresources and the unwillingness of consumers to pay jeopardise the competitiveness of \ndestinations further. Initiatives at the local level facilitated by both private and public sectors can \nimprove the tourism product by investment in resources, as well as the implementation of a \ncomprehensive marketing strategy and mix which supports the competitiveness of the destination. \nThis is particularly important for the small and medium tourism enterprises, which traditionally \ndominate local supply but lack management and marketing expertise to operate their business \nprofessionally and financial resources to approach their target markets.  \n \nTaking advantage of new technologies and the Internet can also enable destinations to enhance \ntheir competitiveness. Technology can improve the efficiency of all local suppliers and also provide \ntools for the development and delivery of differentiated tourism products. Provision of information \non local facilities and attractions and the ability to reserve the whole range of tourism products \ndetermines the ability to attract the new and sophisticated types of tourism demand. The recent \nevolution of Destination Management Systems (DMSs) enables destinations to co-ordinate the \nentire range of products and services offered locally and to promote them globally. The provision of \ndifferentiated and tailor made products becomes much easier as consumers can assemble \nspecialised products and construct their own itinerary. The availability of information on local \nresources and services reduces the cost of individual travel and enables destinations to offer \nmass-customised services.  \n \nMore importantly the new IT tools enable even smaller and peripheral players to compete at equal \nfootage with larger and more central ones and therefore provide an unprecedented opportunity to \nenhance their competitiveness. One of the major benefits is the reduction of dependency on \nintermediaries for the distribution of tourism products. As a consequence, tourism suppliers are \nable to improve their negotiation power with powerful tour operators and can develop a healthier \ndistribution mix. This is particularly significant for remote, peripheral and insular destinations where \nlocal principals and authorities have a great dependency on tourism for their lifehood but lack \nexpertise and resources to undertake comprehensive marketing campaigns. Partnerships \nmarketing through loyalty\/fun clubs enabling destinations to develop long-term relationships with \nconsumers benefit both destinations and suppliers. DMSs should also be utilised to optimise \ntourism impacts by providing an effective mechanism to bridge the expectations of both consumers \nand local residents with their experiences from tourism (Buhalis, 1993, 1994, 1997)  \n \nFinally tourism destinations should learn from past mistakes and appreciate that their strategic \nmanagement and marketing must lead to the optimisation of tourism impacts and the \nachievement of their strategic objectives for all stakeholders. Hitherto, destinations have \nsuffered because they wrongly assumed that the higher the volume of tourists, the more benefits \nthey can achieve. However it is evident that limits on the development of tourism activity should be \nimposed in order to avoid over-exploitation of local resources. Although marketing has often been \nregarded as an enemy of sustainability, destination authorities and principals need to realise that \nstrategic marketing should be used to achieve destination policies. A comprehensive marketing \nstrategy should enable managers and planers to identify appropriate target markets and to \nmaximise economic benefits locally without jeopardising local resources. A suitable communication \nstrategy should support destination authorities to convey their message and promote \nenvironmentally friendly practices locally. \n \nIn conclusion, destination marketing is becoming more complex as tourists consume regions as \nexperiences, often ignoring that tourism products consist of a great number of individually \nproduced products and services. Global competition and industry concentration develop new \nchallenges. In this sense, destination marketers have to achieve the strategic objectives set \nthrough stakeholders\u2019 analysis and match the appropriate demand with supply, by using the entire \nrange of marketing tools for communicating with consumers and suppliers. Global competition and \nthe new, experienced, demanding and sophisticated travellers reposition destination marketing to \nbe the main interface between consumers and local principals. Consumers are increasingly \nfollowing special interests and regard their trips as both recreational and educational experiences. \nTherefore, destination themes and their interpretation become more important for the future. \nTraining of human resources as well as co-operation between competing and complementary \n23\ndestinations enable regions to learn from each other and adapt to demand requirements. \nInnovative marketing led by research and using new technologies, will be the only way to manage \nand market competitive destinations in the future for the benefits of their stakeholders. \n \nREFERENCES \nAgarwal, S. 1997; The resort cycle and seaside tourism: an assessment of its applicability and \nvalidity, Tourism Management, Vol.18(2), pp.65-73. \nAhmed, Z.
