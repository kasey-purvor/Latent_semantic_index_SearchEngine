They have new service\nexpectations and are increasingly dissatisfied with teacher-centred pedagogies. To attract and retain\nthese students, universities will need to rethink their operations. New social technologies mean that\nuniversities have the chance to create a new generation of student-centred learning environments,\nto realize the idea of a University 2.0. The following discussion draws upon a fictional character in\norder to capture the possible futures of such a brave new world.\nIntroduction\nMiranda awoke to the latest hit from Beijing Princess at maximum volume. The aging\nspeakers attached to her brother\u2019s old Zune Plus did little for the music. Accepting the inev-\nitable, Miranda pointed her iPhone at the Zune. The girl band died, only to be replaced\nby the audio track from Doom 5.0. Lost in the sound of a Martian apocalypse, Miranda\nreflected on the disadvantages of a terabyte of storage. It didn\u2019t pay to shuffle: you never\nknew what you might find. A SMS arrived from the University administration reminding\nMiranda she had a tutorial at 10.00 AM. She hadn\u2019t prepared. Time to call Helsinki.\nOn the other end of the line, Ari, the distance student from Finland patiently explained\nthe question. Caliban. It sounded like a breakfast cereal. Then she remembered. The\nShakespeare play. Dispossession. How do you spell that? Yes, she\u2019ll send the anime, sorry,\nthis time, she promised.\nMiranda is a fictional student at a British University in 2012. Her story, however, is\nnot intended simply as science-fiction. The Web 2.0 social technologies that enable\nMiranda\u2019s world of intertwined personal and educational opportunities already exist\nin the present day. Undergraduates at universities worldwide are already using these\n*Corresponding author. Electronic Services Development, University Library University of New\nEngland, Armidale NSW 2351, Australia. Email: cbarnes@une.edu.au\n190 C. Barnes and B. Tynan\ntechnologies in their daily lives. These students have already stepped across a digital\ndivide, leaving behind lecturers still struggling with the implications of the previous\ngeneration of Web technologies. If this gap is not to grow wider, we need to rethink\nthe concept of a university: to look towards the goal of a University 2.0. If this discus-\nsion raises awareness of this issue, and hints at some of the pragmatic reasons why a\nUniversity 2.0 is a desirable goal, it will have achieved its purpose. Otherwise,\nMiranda\u2019s world will remain tantalizingly out of reach.\nBackground\nFew would dispute that the past decade has seen unprecedented innovation in the\narea of Web-based learning and teaching in higher education (Dede, 2000; Garrison\n& Anderson, 2003; Evans et al., 2004; Beetham, 2005; New Media Consortium &\nEDUCAUSE, 2006). Despite the growing range of teaching and learning possibili-\nties, adoption has lagged well behind the advances in technology. The traditional\nlecture remains the dominant method of teaching undergraduate students. Kirkup\nand Kirkwood have observed that: \nteaching staff appropriate those technologies which they can incorporate into their teach-\ning activity most easily, that offer affordances for what they already do, rather than those\nwhich radically change teaching and learning practices. (2005, p. 188)\nPart of the reason for this conservatism is the extent to which teaching modes in\nhigher education are shaped by convention. University teachers have \u2018traditionally\nprogressed from the experience of learning in the classroom to teaching in the class-\nroom\u2019 (Jamieson, 2004, p. 22). Few of the current generation of teaching staff have\nbeen online learners. With some exceptions, teaching staff and the latest cohort of\nundergraduates live in different technological worlds.\nEfforts to bridge this digital divide are often frustrated by competing demands on\nthe time and energies of university teaching staff. Collis observes that: \nwe must publish; we must obtain research funding and carry out empirical research \u2026 we\nare evaluated in our teaching on the basis of student satisfaction and course completion \u2026\nAnd yet we are supposed to be educating our own students to become professionals in the\nnew type of educational environments that we do not even know how to demonstrate\nourselves. (1998, p. 3)\nEven with the best will in the world, many academics are likely to feel that Miranda\u2019s\nworld is simply out of reach. They have been left behind. \nOn the train, Miranda skipped across wireless networks until she found the right podcast.\nGoogle Pod was on the money. Miranda was always good with folksonomy. She liked the\nsound of the South African professor\u2019s voice. What did she look like? Don\u2019t they have\nvblogs in South Africa? Miranda felt a little more confident. She despatched the anime to\nFinland. She was about to disconnect when she remembered that Ari might appreciate the\npodcast. She sent that too.\nAt the cafeteria, Miranda played off MS Book Search against Google Books. She switched\nfrom one to the other, reading enough criticism to confirm her initial ideas. As she went\nLearning in a Web 2.0 millennium 191\nto Project Gutenberg for the text of the play, Miranda\u2019s hand brushed her coffee cup,\ndownloading its streaming contents over her keyboard.\nIn addition to conventional technologies (such as personal computers, the Web and\nemail), students have also embraced mobile technologies. Almost every undergradu-\nate has a digital device of some kind: a mobile phone, PDA, digital camera, iPod or\nMP3 player. Many have devices that fulfil multiple functions (the iPhone is only the\nlatest example of digital convergence). The extent of this transformation is staggering.\nA survey of students born after 1980 at the University of Melbourne revealed the\nfollowing: \n\u2022 High technology access: 96% had a mobile phone, 90% had a desktop computer, 76%\nhad a digital camera, 69% had a MP3 player and 63% had a laptop computer\n\u2022 The most common uses of computer based activities were: email (94%), creating docu-\nments (88%), playing digital music files (84%), searching for information (general 83%\nand study 76%), communicating via instant messaging (80%)\n\u2022 Students were also engaging with emerging technologies, including: blogs (reading\n38%, commenting 27%, maintaining 21%), file sharing (music 38%, photos 31%),\nsocial networking (24%), VOIP (19%) and web-conferencing (19%). (Kennedy et al.,\n2006, p. 3)\nStudies elsewhere have confirmed the extent of undergraduate involvement in the\ncollaborative, social world of Web 2.0. The tools that Miranda uses so well\u2014wikis,\nblogs, vlogs (video-blogs), mashups, podcasts, interactive spaces (e.g. MySpace),\nRSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds, semantic tagging and folksonomy \u2014are near\nubiquitous among the latest generation of young adults (Oblinger, 2007). The passive\nWeb-based learning modes that most academics have yet to adopt are already out of\ndate. If universities are to catch up, then resources, infrastructure, staff development\nand awareness of new modes of learning need to be radically improved. \nMiranda held her breath as she wiped the coffee from her flexible computer. The machine\nsurvived. Again, it didn\u2019t seem to mind decaf in moderation. Just as well.\nAt the heart of the Web 2.0 ideal is the notion that the harnessing collective intel-\nligence will yield dividends to organizations as well as consumers. O\u2019Reilly has argued\nthat: \nWeb 2.0 applications are those that make the most intrinsic advantages of that platform:\ndelivering software as a continually-updated service that gets better the more people use\nit, consuming and remixing data from multiple sources, including individual users, while\nproviding their own data and services in a form that allows remixing by others, creating\nnetwork effects through an \u2018architecture of participation\u2019, and going beyond the page\nmetaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences. (2005a)\nIt is not surprising that Web 2.0 has attracted attention among educational theo-\nrists. Hinchliffe (2007) describes it as \u2018white hot\u2019. The new technologies that enable\nusers to create, search, control and syndicate content hold revolutionary promise\nfor enhancing learning through collaboration and social interactivity (Fumero,\n2005). \n192 C. Barnes and B. Tynan\nThe South African professor had referred to an article in a local journal. Miranda hadn\u2019t\nfound it anywhere. She\u2019d gone through the university library catalogue, Google Scholar\nand Windows Live Academic. Nothing. Ari\u2019s return email with its collection of podcast\nlinks and del.icio.us tags (poor Ari\u2014still using del.icio.us!) gave the answer. Try Jan\nSzczepanski\u2019s list of Open Access Journals at G\u00f6teborg. Look for the journal under its\ninitials. She passed Ari\u2019s email on to her circle of friends. A few clicks later she was reading\nthe article. She sent that on too. Time for some hot soup.\nMiranda\u2019s computer survived the soup. Things were looking up.\nFacing the issues\nMiranda\u2019s world will not come into being without effort. As we have seen, the likeli-\nhood is that educators will engage with Web 2.0 technologies in the same old ways.\nAs Kirkup and Kirkwood have shown, teaching staff in higher education will probably\nemploy the latest technologies to teach much as they have done in the past, if left to\ntheir own devices. To the extent that, say, podcasting has begun to make an impact\nin higher education, this has already happened. Most podcasts are last year\u2019s lecture\nin digital format. Student remixing of podcasts, use of syndication to pool collective\nresponses and other more active learning approaches are losing out to those that see\npodcasting as a high-tech alternative to the audio cassette of the 1980s. To avoid this\noutcome, university policy-makers and teaching staff alike need to listen to the call\nfor fresh pedagogies, such as connectivism (Siemens, 2005). Teachers can learn from\ntheir students. They can design and develop twenty-first-century methods of teach-\ning, instead of hanging onto warmed-over approaches from the past. However, this\nwill not happen unless they are given the time, resources and organizational space to\nmake the attempt.\nWhy should hard-pressed university administrators take the risk? Is the lecture not\nstill the most cost-effective form of teaching? Although these arguments have\nprevailed for some time, they are far less relevant in a Web 2.0 world. Failing to make\nthe best use of the new opportunities is not a realistic option. Universities, like other\nenterprises, now live in a competitive environment. As O\u2019Reilly reminds us \nThe competitive opportunity for new entrants is to fully embrace the potential Web 2.0.\nCompanies that succeed will create applications that learn from their users, using an archi-\ntecture of participation to build a commanding advantage not just in the software interface,\nbut in the richness of the shared data. (2005b)\nThose universities that are prepared to teach in new ways are likely to win out in the\nmarketplace. The commercialization and internationalization of the university sector\nin many countries has meant that higher education providers are now far more sensi-\ntive to the needs of undergraduates as consumers. Students are also now more\ndiscerning in terms of outcomes and the quality of their educational experience.\nThe traditional lecture is not an appealing product. Most undergraduates have\ngrown up with an anytime, anywhere lifestyle. They complete a range of online social,\npersonal and financial transactions at their convenience. They shop, make friends,\nsell, communicate, exchange gifts, generate creative works and even make war (if only\nLearning in a Web 2.0 millennium 193\nvirtually) over the Web. Many find the traditional lecture old-fashioned and boring.\nWhether due to alternative work or lifestyle commitments, instrumentalist\napproaches to learning, the availability of alternatives or simply a reduced tolerance\nfor boredom, undergraduate absences from lectures in countries such as the United\nStates, Great Britain and Australia is on the rise. A recent discussion of the literature\nhas concluded that the \u2018trend towards non-attendance is inevitable\u2019 (Massingham &\nHerrington, 2006, p. 97). It is clear that a growing number of undergraduates would\nprefer not to attend lectures if effective online alternatives were available. University\npolicy-makers who would like to secure first-mover advantages might like to take note.\nWeb 2.0 teaching has other potential benefits for universities. Many universities\nremain dependent on public funds. Where this is the case, there are signs that taxpay-\ners (or at least the governments that presume to speak for them) are becoming more\ndemanding in terms of performance measures. Those universities that perform worst\nin terms of grades, attrition rates and graduate skills have found themselves under\nincreasing pressure. Effective use of the new Web 2.0 technologies can reduce the risk\nof a diminishing spiral of reduced funding, shrinking resources and poorer student\noutcomes. Not to move ahead means to fall behind.\nThis argument is strongest in relation to attrition rates. There is abundant\nevidence that the traditional lecture is not the best form of teaching for weaker\nstudents (Goldfinch, 1996; Reynolds, 1997; Boylan & Saxon, 2005). Those under-\ngraduates who initially fail to make the transition to higher education are often\nprecisely those who have benefited least from these. As Boylan and Saxon observe: \nStudents in remedial course have been lectured to in the past without much effect. If tradi-\ntional teaching methods had worked for these students, they would not be taking remedial\ncourses. (2005, p. 3)\nActive learning strategies, such as those facilitated by Web 2.0 technologies, are likely\nto be far more effective in the case of such under-prepared students. It makes long-\nterm sense for universities to invest in better teaching. Lowering standards is, of\ncourse, still the cheapest option of all, but is unsustainable in the longer term.\nBenefits from better teaching are likely to flow on to all students. Once again, the\nissue is only partly a question of engagement and willingness to change. Equally\nimportant is the issue of resources, technical support and institutional flexibility. Not\nto spend on the development of new approaches is penny wise and pound foolish. \nMiranda was the first to arrive. When she walked in, sensors activated the room lights, the\nair-conditioning and the wall screen. As she unrolled her computer, the room\u2019s wireless\nnetwork connected and launched SkypeVideo. The tutorial began a few minutes later. The\ntutor and five other students attended in person. Another four connected from Edinburgh,\nAmsterdam, Helsinki and Vancouver.\nThanks to Miranda and Ari, the class was well-prepared. Within twenty minutes, the\ndesert island of the Tempest had been left behind, Caliban\u2019s fate momentarily forgotten.\nTheir tutor plunged the class headfirst into the tangled tickets of literary theory. Miranda\nwas grateful that the tutorial was being recorded. When their tutor referred to Riemann\nSpace in a lengthy explanation of Derrida and deconstruction, the group lost him. Even\nten seconds later, when Miranda had looked up the Reimann Space in Google, she was no\n194 C. Barnes and B. Tynan\nwiser. Ari\u2019s question, and the follow-up from Jane in Canada, indicated that incomprehen-\nsion was transatlantic. The group would need to reconnect after the tutorial and discuss\nthe point.\nWhat of theory?\nWhere does Miranda fit into educational theory? Put simply, theory operates on a\nhorizon that extends from behaviourism to constructivism and perhaps to the\nnew connectivism. Behaviourism is based on didactic and transmission-oriented\napproaches whereby it is the teacher\u2019s responsibility to transfer knowledge to\nstudents. Students respond to stimuli. Feedback from the teacher informs them\nwhether they are correct. The student is a passive receiver, and the teacher is central\nto whether learning occurs. The teacher\u2019s focus is on \u2018steering behaviour and not on\ncognitive steering processes\u2019 (Asmus et al., 2005, p. 1). While this approach has fallen\nout of favour among educational theorists, it remains a standard form of learning in\nhigher education. Lecturers transfer knowledge and tutorials provide students with\nfeedback. Where knowledge is fixed, this form of learning can be reasonably effective,\nleading to a model of education as a process of transmission, where resources are\n\u2018centralized, standardized, and delivered through a top-down method\u2019 (Asmus et al.,\n2005, p. 2). Miranda\u2019s world is quite the opposite.\nFurther along the continuum from behaviourism is cognitivism. This is more\nconcerned with the \u2018inner processes of the brain seeking to differentiate, investigate\nand bring these processes together into mutual relation\u2019 (Baumgartner, 2005, p. 2).\nAlly (2004) highlights the focus within cognitivism on the transfer of information by\nthe learner into long-term memory. Cognitivism involves recognition of the fact that\nstudents process information through a range of actions, and acknowledges individual\ndifferences (Kolb, 1984; Mayer, 1998). Cognitive teaching strategies are therefore\nresponsive to individual learning styles. Like other \u2018isms\u2019, cognitivism draws upon a\nsubstantive field of theory; not the least of which are the contributions made by the\nRussian theorist Vygotskii (1896\u20131934). However, essentially the teacher remains no\nmore than the controller of the learning environment. He or she facilitates the learn-\ning process through a range of learning activities. This is in stark contrast to transfer\nof an inert, static body of knowledge. Once again, the fit between this model and\nMiranda\u2019s world is inexact. Although Miranda is not totally autonomous, she plays a\nbig part in shaping her learning environment. \nMiranda spent the rest of the afternoon in Georgian London. Her history group had been\nset the task of writing a Wikipedia article on anti-Catholic feeling and the outbreak of the\nWar of Jenkins Ear (1739). Sitting alone in a quiet corner of the university library,\nMiranda was free to explore the Net. Pulses of light sped across oceans and bounced from\ncity to city, as her group gathered material from libraries and archives. The text of early\nbroadsheets, parliamentary debates and private letters were assembled. Sebastian, from\nMadrid, provided a running commentary on the Spanish perspective during the count-\ndown to war. No one mentioned Gibraltar. Sebastian had refought the siege of 1779\u201383 a\nfew weeks earlier. His opponent had been Miranda\u2019s brother and Sebastian had won\neasily. Three times.\nLearning in a Web 2.0 millennium 195\nAt the far end of the horizon to behaviourism is constructivism, where teachers\nand their students engage in activities where knowledge is not predetermined. As\nLaurillard states, it appears to encompass \u2018all educators who reject the \u201ctransmission\nmodel\u201d of teaching\u2019 (2002, p. 67). According to Baumgartner, constructivism is\nfounded on the idea that \u2018learning is considered as an active process in which people\nconstruct their knowledge by relating it to their previous experiences in complex and\nreal situations in life\u2019 (2005, p. 40).\nThe teacher\u2019s role is to be a collaborator in the construction of knowledge. The\nteacher and student both engage equally in description, explanation, understanding,\nreflection and disclosure. They provide opportunities for complex information to be\ninterpreted alongside the learner\u2019s needs and ways of knowing the world (Burge,\n1995). Further: \nthat in this model of action actors are mutually dependent on one another because they\nmust agree on and coordinate their plans of actions \u2026 The actors try to coordinate their\nplans of actions by consent and to execute them only under the condition of collectively\nachieved agreement. (Baumgartner, 2005, p. 10)\nConnectivism seems to be emerging as a new educational theory, although it is not\nwithout its critics (Verhagen, 2006; Wise & Quealy, 2006). These claim that connec-\ntivism does not go beyond traditional social constructivist theory. Even so, connec-\ntivism should be recognized as a valid attempt to develop a theoretical framework that\naccords with our developing information environment. Siemens (2005) believes that\nwe cannot continue to do as we have done and match traditional models to new tools.\nThe key principles of connectivism are: \n\u25cf learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions;\n\u25cf learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources;\n\u25cf learning may reside in non-human appliances;\n\u25cf capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known;\n\u25cf nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning;\n\u25cf ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill;\n\u25cf currency (up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities;\nand\n\u25cf decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the mean-\ning of incoming information is seen through the lens of shifting reality. While there\nis a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the informa-\ntion climate affecting the decision.\nConnectivism, like social constructivist theory, sees the role of the teacher as one\nof mediator. The key idea is that learning starts with the connections that students\nmake and not with a fixed body of content. Here Miranda\u2019s world comes into sharp\nfocus.\nMiranda\u2019s world is not without its problems. If we are to move towards a Web 2.0\nmodel, the higher education community also needs to take into account the issues\nraised by Crie (2004). Crie alerts us that access, security and free expression need to\n196 C. Barnes and B. Tynan\nbe considered carefully in relation to issues of privacy, freedom of information and\nstudent safety. Not all students will want to engage with new social technologies as\npart of their education. Others may see participation as an erosion of their autonomy,\nconstricting rather than empowering. Miranda may be confident and assured, but this\nattitude cannot be assumed. \nThe group had agreed that they would create an audio podcast after they had finished the\nWikipedia article. Katalin, from Dublin, had assembled audio clips of waves, cannon-fire\nand creaking timbers. Jim, a Londoner, had God Save the King sung in lusty chorus on CD.\nAccording to Google the song was a little late (1744). Rule, Britannia! (1740) was fine,\nif put in towards the end. Jim\u2019s father, a barrister, would deliver lines from speeches by\nSir Robert Walpole. Sebastian would stand-in for the Spanish ambassador, anxiously writ-\ning back to Madrid. They were only lacking a blood-curdling scream for the moment when\nCaptain Jenkins and his ear parted company. Miranda\u2019s brother was looking through his\ngame collection. Screams were usually not a problem.\nOnce completed, the podcast would be posted on the Net. Miranda hoped it might remind\npeople that wars fought on thin pretexts were always a mistake. Like wars in general.\nThere are other important issues to address. Miranda and her varied classmates may\nbe an exception. In the real world, undergraduates often lack life experience. There\nis a danger that all individuals in the same group will share the same limited perspec-\ntives. Groups need to be aware of subtle vetting processes that can produce conformity.\nAnother risk is that content can be filtered through aggregation.\nA further problem is that user-selected content may not be reliable. Without tradi-\ntional gatekeepers, such as librarians, students will need to learn how to evaluate\ninformation. Users of folksonomies may be at home in their own online environ-\nments. They must also engage with more formal methods of labelling the world if they\nare to become effective searchers. Librarians and professional researchers use\ncontrolled vocabularies for a purpose, even if their rationale seem mysterious to most\nstudents (Asmus et al., 2005).\nUniversity 2.0\nMiranda\u2019s teachers will have access to a sophisticated set of technologies for use in\nthe online learning environment. However, they need to be careful not to make rash\nassumptions about how she uses these tools. If they do, Miranda\u2019s interest might\nwander, particularly if their assumptions seem common-place or unimaginative.\nMiranda\u2019s competence in the use of Web 2.0 technologies in her private life has\nclearly spilled over into her learning. But will all students be as capable? If they are\nnot, what strategies will teaching staff use to assist? Miranda\u2019s diary provides us with\nsome warnings, as well a range of possibilities for new models of learning.\nThe width of the digital divide will depend on more than the capacity of teachers\nto depart from traditional forms of instructions. University policy-makers must also\nconsider how to enable and support students such as Miranda. Just how committed\nare institutions to flexibility and responsiveness when it comes to administrative and\ntechnical functions? Web 2.0 requires a conceptual response that differs from business\nLearning in a Web 2.0 millennium 197\nas usual. Most undergraduates now expect the same level of service from university\nadministrations that they receive from their ISP or mobile phone provider. If they are\nnot happy with a provider, they switch.\nHow does all this work in practice? How can universities and shrinking budgets\nengage with the demands of connectivism? To begin to answer this question, we must\nfirst consider just how archaic universities must appear to many students. As a\nmethod of teaching, the traditional lecture is far older than the first universities\n(which appeared in the twelfth century). Yet it remains the cornerstone of undergrad-\nuate education in the twenty-first century.\nThe absurdity is that the most modern lecturers lack any grounding in formal rhet-\noric, once an essential part of the medieval trivium. By mediaeval standards, today\u2019s\nuniversity lecturers (with the exception of those in education and related disciplines)\nare untrained amateurs in the art of oral presentation. The pretence that university\nexperience and research output qualify a lecturer to teach is as transparently false now\nas it was two decades ago (Penner, 1984).\nHow might lectures be delivered in the future? In Miranda\u2019s world, the only\nlectures that students hear are delivered by academics who are able to use the medium\nto its best advantage. Miranda, like many students in her day, does not attend lectures\nin person. Instead, her lectures are delivered as podcasts and streamed over the Web.\nThese are not recorded in a lecture hall, but under studio conditions. Consortia of\nuniversities exist that federate the best podcasts so as to reduce duplication of effort.\nThe rationale for such consortia is obvious. Many universities now teach out of the\nsame textbooks and, for many undergraduate courses, content does not vary signifi-\ncantly from one university to another (at least within the same country). Universities\nalready share online learning objects; the sharing of lectures is simply another step.\nEqually significant is the way in which Miranda makes use of these podcasts. Her\nteachers use them as the basis for a more active, student-centred approach to learn-\ning. Miranda and her peers do not need to rely on their own note-taking. They can\nreplay the lectures any time they like. If they are uncertain at any point, they can pause\nand rerun the recording. More importantly, access to mobile technologies means that\nstudents can annotate the recording, and send their comments on to other learners.\nThey can interrogate each other and share understandings.\nUniversity 2.0 is not simply a collection of technologies. Like Web 2.0, it is prima-\nrily a concept, a way of thinking. A university in Miranda\u2019s world is a place where\ninformal and formal learning occurs, initially over the course of a degree, but ulti-\nmately over a lifetime. Miranda participates in parallel communities where personal,\neducational and professional life lines blur. Miranda participates fully in her educa-\ntional experiences by cooperating with others to build experiences within an \u2018archi-\ntecture of participation\u2019 (O\u2019Reilly, 2005a). The university acts as a service provider\nthat \u2018harnesses the power of the users themselves\u2019 (O\u2019Reilly, 2005b).\nMiranda, like her present-day peers, creates content and forms part of the dynamic\nWeb. The difference is that Miranda employs these social technologies in ways rele-\nvant to her study. To do so, she needs seamless access to the university\u2019s administra-\ntive and technical infrastructures. If University 2.0 means harnessing the collective\n198 C. Barnes and B. Tynan\nintelligence of an institution for the benefit of learners, it is up to universities to make\ntheir resources more accessible. A visit to almost any university web site reveals just\nhow far institutions are from such an ideal.\nCrucial to the concept of University 2.0 is the realization that universities must\nabandon the idea that they are custodians of a fixed body of knowledge. Miranda and\nher peers are trusted to seek out, organize and evaluate information in a world in\nwhich knowledge is growing at an explosive rate. What is regarded as true today may\nnot be so tomorrow. Miranda\u2019s teachers respond to the way in which students engage\nin an environment of constant intellectual change. They are guides and facilitators,\nnot inerrant sages. University 2.0 will value teachers who place active learners like\nMiranda at the centre of their work. \nMiranda spent the night at her flat. She had logged onto the university\u2019s student space,\nintending to upload some digital pictures, when she found a new link on her page. The\nlink invited her to contact a new student at the university, a boy from her home town:\nBridgetown, Barbados. From the photograph posted on his profile, quite a good-looking\none at that. Miranda\u2019s face broke into grin, as she started typing. Shakespeare might\nhave to wait till tomorrow.\nConclusion\nThis discussion has drawn attention to some of the issues associated with Miranda\u2019s\nbrave new world. The most important of these is the need to rethink teaching and\nlearning within higher education. University teaching has fallen behind changes in\nsocial technologies. Whereas universities are still struggling to assimilate the first wave\nof Web-based teaching tools, an increasing number of students have already arrived\nin a Web 2.0 world. To meet the needs of these students, universities must reconsider\ntheir priorities. The latest social technologies have the potential to deliver truly\nstudent-centred learning environments, to create a University 2.0. However, this will\nnot happen overnight or without sustained effort.\nThis paper ends with a call to develop alternative ways of viewing university\nlearning and to rethink the concept of a university itself. Such a discussion must\ninvolve all those working within the higher education sector, particularly the deci-\nsion-makers who shape institutional policies on teaching and learning. The authors\ndo not presume to provide the answers. Miranda\u2019s narrative is intended to do no\nmore than provoke, to open the door to new ways of thinking. And there is no time\nlike the present. Social technologies are already shaping the private and social\nworlds of millennium students. The task for educators and policy-makers is to\nbridge the existing digital divide before it becomes wider, and a generation of\nopportunities is lost.\nReferences\nAlly, M.
