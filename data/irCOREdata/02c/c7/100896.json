Schottky-based \u201csandwich\u201d structures were fabricated\nfrom layers of either poly\u00031-methoxy-4-\u00012-ethylhexyloxy\u0002-phenylenevinylene\u0004 \u0001MEH-PPV\u0002 or\npoly\u00019,9-dioctylfluorene\u0002 \u0001PFO\u0002 on indium tin oxide substrates using a top contact of aluminum.\nGood rectification was achieved from the Al-polymer contact, with a reverse bias leakage current\ndensity as low as 4 nA\/cm2 at an electric field strength of 25 kV\/cm. Irradiation with x-rays from\na 50 kV x-ray tube produced a linear increase in photocurrent over a dose rate range from\n4 to 18 mGy\/s. The observed x-ray sensitivities of 240 nC\/mGy\/cm3 for MEH-PPV and\n480 nC\/mGy\/cm3 for PFO structures are comparable to that reported for Si devices. A response\ntime of \u0002150 ms to pulsed x-ray irradiation was measured with no evidence of long-lived current\ntransients. Conjugated polymers offer the advantage of easy coatability over large areas and on\ncurved surfaces. Their low average atomic number provides tissue-equivalent dosimetric response,\nwith many potential applications including medical x-ray and synchrotron photon detection. \u00a9 2007\nAmerican Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2748337\u0004\nIn the past two decades, conjugated polymers have been\nemployed in the fabrication of light-emitting diodes,1 field-\neffect transistors,2 photovoltaic devices,3 and super-\nconductors.4 The advantages of polymers over conventional\ninorganic semiconductors are their relatively low cost, suit-\nability for both large areas and nanoscale applications,5 me-\nchanical flexibility, and most importantly, the potential for\nprintable electronic circuits for integrated plastic\nelectronics.6 The use of conjugated polymers7 for ionizing\nradiation detection is likewise expected to offer several ad-\nvantages in comparison to silicon, which is the most com-\nmonly used semiconductor for high fluence x-ray detection,\ne.g., at synchrotron sources or for medical dosimetry. Unlike\nsilicon, polymers can be coated over large areas and onto\ncurved surfaces through deposition from solutions in volatile\nsolvents, such as in dip coating, spin casting, and ink-jet\nprinting. Furthermore, polymers have a low average atomic\nnumber, which makes them equivalent to human tissue when\nused in x-ray dosimetry in clinical applications.\nDespite these potential advantages, very little attention\nhas been paid to the application of polymers in direct charge-\nbased radiation detection, as opposed to passive thermolumi-\nnescent or optical dosimeters. Early studies in the 1950s of\ninsulating polymers, such as poly\u0001methyl methacrylate\u0002 and\npolyethylene, as tissue-equivalent x-ray dosimetry detectors8\nconcluded that the combination of very low mobilities and\nshort carrier lifetimes severely limited their x-ray sensitivity.\nMore recently, alpha particle sensitivity has been demon-\nstrated from polyactylene sheets which showed drift mobili-\nties of 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 cm2\/V s for electrons and holes,\nrespectively.9 With such a relatively low mobility, when such\na material is used in a detector, it must be kept rather thin in\norder to extract a useful current. However, there is a trade-off\nagainst the requirement to use a thicker detection layer to\nachieve a sufficient interaction volume. For x-ray dosimetry\nuse a polymer-based detector should have a sensitivity com-\nparable to that of silicon, which is typically of the order of\n300 nC\/mGy\/cm3.10\nIn this letter, we present the first report of the directly\ngenerated x-ray photocurrent response of conjugated poly-\nmers. We use poly\u00031-methoxy-4-\u00012-ethylhexyloxy\u0002-\nphenylenevinylene\u0004 \u0001MEH-PPV\u0002 whose charge transport\nproperties have been extensively studied elsewhere.11,12\nMEH-PPV was synthesized following a procedure reported\nin the literature.13,14 Its molecular weight, determined via gel\npermeation chromatography, is 2.85\u0003105 g mole\u22121, with a\npolydispersity index of 1.87. Additionally, we use poly\u00019,9-\ndioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl\u0002 \u0001PFO\u0002, which is a promising mate-\nrial for blue emission light-emitting diodes.15 It was obtained\nfrom American Dye Source, Inc. and used as received.\nHigh electric field strengths are necessary to maximize\nthe displacement current from the drifting charge carriers, so\nrequiring a high quality rectifying junction with low reverse\nbias leakage current. Good rectification has been demon-\nstrated for Schottky contacts on MEH-PPV using various\nhigher work-function metals, including Al \u00014.4 eV\u0002 and Au\n\u00015.2 eV\u0002.16 For indium tin oxide \u0001ITO\u0002\/MEH-PPV\/Al de-\nvices, the barrier height for electron injection from Al is\n1.4 eV, and for hole injection from ITO it is 0.6 eV. When\noperated in reverse bias \u0001with Al as the cathode\u0002, leakage\ncurrents of the order of 10 nA\/cm2 are observed in thin de-\nvices, which are predominantly due to thermionic\nemission.17,18\nFor efficient operation as an x-ray detector, thick poly-\nmer layers \u0001i.e., \u000410 \u0001m\u0002 are required to maximize the x-ray\nphoton attenuation. In previous work, conjugated polymers\nhave not been deposited as such thick layers, as these are not\nrequired for optoelectronic or photovoltaic applications.

To form a rear contact with the ITO, a 70 nm thick\nlayer of the hole-injecting polymer blend poly\u00013,4-ethylene-\ndioxythiophene\u0002\/poly\u0001styrene-sulphonic acid\u0002 \u0001PEDOT:PSS\u0002,\nsupplied by HC Starck \u0001Germany\u0002, was first spin cast onto\nthe ITO-coated glass substrates \u00015000 rpm for 30 s\u0002. The PE-\nDOT:PSS films were baked in air for 15 min at 130 \u00b0C. The\nactive region of the device was then fabricated through the\nsuccessive drop casting of approximately 2 \u0001m films of ei-\nther PFO or MEH-PPV to create a thick layer. The polymer\nconcentration in the toluene solutions were 1.33% and 0.66%\nby weight for PFO and MEH-PPV, respectively. After each\ndrop casting, the film was annealed at 120 \u00b0C in air for\n15 min, to eliminate solvent and to allow good interface for-\nmation between the films. The thick layers consisted of up to\neight films, making an average total thickness on the order of\n20 \u0001m for the stack. The roughness of the final surface of\nthe PFO was relatively smooth but MEH-PPV showed a very\nnonuniform surface with a small number of peaks in excess\nof 100 \u0001m, according to surface profilometry \u0001Veeco Dek-\ntak\u0002. Finally, a square \u00015\u00035 mm2\u0002 Al cathode \u0001thickness of\n100 nm\u0002 was thermally evaporated onto the polymer layer\nusing a metal shadow mask.\nThe x-ray photocurrent measurements were carried out\nusing an Oxford Instrument XF5011 50 kV x-ray tube with a\nmolybdenum target, which produced a maximum 1 mA cur-\nrent. The I-V characteristics in the dc and x-ray stimulated\nmodes were measured by an automated Keithley 487 com-\nbined picoammeter and voltage source. All measurements\nwere carried out in air.\nThe electrical performance of the Schottky junction for\nboth the MEH-PPV and PFO thick film devices was investi-\ngated at high field strength. Figure 1 compares the reverse dc\ncharacteristics of both devices in the range from zero to\n\u2212200 V. Both devices show extremely low current densities\nat \u2212200 V \u0001corresponding to a mean field strength in the\nrange of 100\u2013200 kV\/cm\u0002, which is an essential require-\nment for operation as an x-ray photoconductor. At \u2212200 V,\ncurrent densities of 12 and 88 nA\/cm2 were observed for\nMEH-PPV and PFO, respectively. These compare favorably\nwith the reverse bias current density of 100 nA\/cm2 ob-\nserved at 50 kV\/cm in much thinner \u0001800 nm\u0002 ITO\/MEH-\nPPV\/Al luminescent devices.17 The inset I-V curve for MEH-\nPPV from \u2212200 to +200 V shows the good rectification\nbehavior of the device. The forward bias current has a linear\nform over this voltage range and is dominated by the high\nseries resistance of the thick polymer layer, which limits the\nforward bias current to \u00020.5 \u0001A. Furthermore, a comparison\nbetween the devices indicates that for voltages below \u221260 V,\nPFO shows lower leakage current of less than 2 nA and then\nincreasing sharply to 20 nA at \u2212200 V, while MEH-PPV has\na stable dark current between 1 and 3 nA over the whole\nrange.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that a multilayer MEH-PPV struc-\nture can exhibit good electrical properties and can preserve\nthe high rectification which is observed for thinner single-\nlayer MEH-PPV devices. Both devices show a reverse bias\nleakage current which increases slowly with field strength,\nalthough this increase is notably higher in the PFO device.\nWe note that similar nonsaturation of the reverse bias current\nhas been reported in ITO\/MEH-PPV\/Al devices, due to the\nimage-force lowering of the Schottky barrier height.17\nFigure 2 shows the dc and x-ray response of the PFO\ndevice, for an applied voltage range of up to \u221250 V. Part \u0001a\u0002\nrepresents the x-ray induced photocurrent-voltage of the de-\nvice as a function of x-ray dose rate. Part \u0001b\u0002 shows the\nphotocurrent-dose behavior and calculated sensitivity of the\ndetector to x-ray irradiation at certain bias voltages.\nFigure 2\u0001a\u0002 shows a systematic increase in photocurrent\nas a function of increasing x-ray dose rate, up to\n18.5 mGy\/s. At lower dose rates, the photocurrent increases\nlinearly with applied voltage, whereas some reduction in the\ngradient of the photocurrent is observed for higher dose rates\nabove \u221215 V. At \u221250 V the photocurrent increases by a fac-\ntor of 5 from the dark current value of 0.9 nA at zero dose\nrate, to 4.5 nA at a dose rate of 18.5 mGy\/s.

The photocurrent has been cor-\nrected by subtracting the dark current at zero dose. The slope\nof these data gives the x-ray dose sensitivity S of the device\n\u0001in C\/Gy\u0002, defined as\nS =\nIC\nD\n,\nwhere IC is the corrected photocurrent and D is the dose rate\nin Gy\/s.\nAt a bias voltage of \u221210 V, the sensitivity of the PFO\ndevice to x-rays for the linear part of the graph is calculated\nas 0.064 nC\/mGy, which increases to 0.24 nC\/mGy at\n\u221250 V. Expressed in terms of sensitivity per unit volume,\nthis corresponds to 128\u2013480 nC\/mGy\/cm3, which compares\nwell with silicon devices \u0003up to 500 nC\/mGy\/cm3 \u0001Ref.\n10\u0002\u0004. Since there is no evidence of saturation in the photo-\ncurrent at high bias, the device sensitivity will presumably\nincrease further at higher applied field strengths. Similar I-V\nphotocurrent data are obtained as a function of dose rate for\nthe MEH-PPV device. This device shows similar behavior to\nthe PFO device although the level of dark current is approxi-\nmately 50% higher over the whole of the measured voltage\nrange. At \u221210 V bias the MEH-PPV device gives a sensitiv-\nity of 0.1 nC\/mGy \u0001equivalent to 200 nC\/mGy\/cm3\u0002, which\nis marginally higher than for the PFO device under the same\nbias conditions.\nFigure 3 shows the time response of the x-ray photocur-\nrent measured from the MEH-PPV device using a modulated\nx-ray beam. The beam modulation was achieved using a\nslowly rotating six-bladed metal chopper wheel. The thick-\nness of the metal blades was sufficient to attenuate approxi-\nmately 50% of the x-ray dose. In the main plot in Fig. 3, the\nx-ray beam is switched on at an arbitrary time marker of\n1800 ms. The measured current increases from a dark current\nof 0.6 nA to a photocurrent of 1.4 nA. The bias voltage was\nkept constant at \u221210 V. With the wheel turning, the x-ray\nphotocurrent is clearly modulated with a period of \u00050.5 s.\nBased on these data, an estimate of the response time of the\ndetector is faster than 150 ms.\nThe inset in Fig. 3 is the photocurrent response for the\nMEH-PPV device, initially at zero bias. A bias of \u221210 V is\napplied at point A, and after an initial relaxation, a steady\nstate current is observed. At point B, the x-ray beam is turned\non with a dose rate of 18.5 mGy\/s, resulting in an increase\nin the photocurrent. Subsequently, when the beam is\nswitched off, the current reduces to the original value. Note\nthat the shape of the \u201crelaxation\u201d is preserved even during\nthe switching on and off of the beam, indicating that the\nx-ray induced increase in the photocurrent is independent of\nthe dark current level. After prolonged exposure times, there\nis no observable loss of x-ray sensitivity, indicating that the\npolymer shows no sign of radiation damage for doses in\nexcess of 10 Gy.\nIn summary, the direct detection of x-ray induced pho-\ntocurrents has been achieved in two different conjugated\npolymers. In each polymer, good x-ray sensitivity and linear-\nity were achieved for dose rates up to 18 mGy\/s, demon-\nstrating their applicability as organic direct-detection x-ray\nsensors. Although the carrier mobilities for PFO are expected\nto be about two orders of magnitude higher than that for\nMEH-PPV,19,20 there is no marked difference in device per-\nformance between the two devices. In future work, increases\nin film thickness, and the use of the next generation of higher\nmobility conjugated polymers, will greatly increase the po-\ntential for x-ray imaging applications, such as in the security\nand medical sectors. Appropriate processing of the polymer\nwill enable the production of fibers in \u201cactive\u201d textile radia-\ntion dosimeters, such as in \u201cdetector clothing\u201d for workers at\nrisk of exposure to radiation.\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the\nU.K. PPARC through Grant No. PPA\/G\/S\/2003\/00158.
