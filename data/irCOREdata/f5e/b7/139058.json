Within companies, many decisions have to be taken throughout\nthe product design and development based on accessing data and information. The quality and timeliness of\nsuch decisions depends on the data availability.

One of\nthese challenges is the data explosion that has taken\nplace in the last decade, involving the increase and\nintegration of the outsourcing to the extended enterprise.\nThus, companies need to manage increasing datasets,\nand have to allow their employees and partners to access,\nshare, use and integrate it easily, at the right time, the\nright place, the right format and the right quality.\nThe massive quantity of data and tools represent the main\nbarriers to the access of digital data. Thus, to compete,\ncompanies need to manage data as they are managing\nany other resource in the company and that they have to\nuse the best of the technology. For instance, in the design\nprocess, 3D modelling has increased significantly and its\naccess allows people to use the information much more\nrapidly. The improvements in terms of managing data\ntools and technology have helped companies to deal with\nthis new challenge. However, the quantity and complexity\nof the tools and processes can make this data difficult to\naccess.\nWith constant improvement of the technologies and the\nInternet revolution, digital data has become the source\naround which decisions are based. Specifically, in the\ndesign process, companies have to deal with a large\namount of data and processes.\nEntering a 3D world was a huge revolution but it creates\nnumerous extra data. Engineering companies are\nsignificantly increasing their dependency on 3D data, in-\nline with its 3D as master policy. For instance, some of\nthese companies proposed to eliminate 2D drawings\nthrough enriching the 3D.\nAs the quantity and quality of the data in the 3D model\nincreases, the digital data accessibility and availability has\nto be reviewed in order to identify new customers and use\nof the data. The current issue of increased data volumes,\nmore complex systems\/processes and a wider spread\nextended enterprise make it difficult to clearly\ncommunicate, and enable everyone to take advantage of\nnew technology, capability and flexibility provided by\ndigital data. Thus, there is a need for enhancing the digital\ndesign data availability for its use in supporting product\ndesign, engineering and development, in order to make\nbetter decisions in a shorter time. Therefore this research\nproject focuses on digital design data in the aerospace\nindustry. The main aim of this research is to develop a\nroadmap to enhance the utilisation of digital data within\nthe aerospace engineering discipline, both in terms of\noptimizing existing processes and identifying new\nmethods of visual management techniques.\n2 RELATED LITERATURE\nNowadays, data explosion is one of the most important\nproblems that the companies need to manage. According\nto Walker [1], a business in 2007 needs to store ten times\nmore data than in 2000. In the same way, Gartner\nConsulting estimated than in 2012, this factor will be\nincreased by thirty. It is really important to understand that\nin the past 30 years, the information technology utilisation\nhas become widely circulated, mostly within the design,\nengineering and manufacturing processes.\nThus, data management methods need to focus on the\nretrieval of data. Indeed, storing data is nowadays quite\nquick and easy but finding the data and information that\nyou need in the vast quantity of stored data is definitely\nmuch more difficult [2].CIRP Design Conference 2009\nIt has been identified that up to 80% of product costs are\ndefined during early concept design [3]. Engineering\ncompanies need to improve constantly their product life\ncycle by working on the triptych cost-quality-time. For\ninstance, the last years have seen a diminution of a car\nlife cycle from 10 years to only 4 to 6 years nowadays [4].\nThus, accessing and sharing digital data appears to be a\nkey success factor in the centre of this significant change.\nIndeed, with the globalisation, companies have to work\nwith suppliers and partners all over the world and sharing\nquality data in real time is a daily challenge [5].\nIn recent years, one of the major improvements in terms\nof sharing and accessing data was the implementation\nand utilisation of Virtual Reality (VR) resulting in reducing\nproduct development lead-time.\nVR represents a model \u201cwhich is not real, but may be\nconsidered to be real while using it\u201d [6]. One of the main\nadvantages by using VR is the replacement of the\nmajority of real prototypes by a virtual one. Thus, the\ndesign can be reviewed and modified before any physical\nprototype is built [7]. Indeed, VR allows a simple\nvisualization, representation and analysis of a complex 3D\nmodel [8]. Therefore, the utilisation of virtual systems\nimplies a large improvement in terms of time, costs and\nquality, achieving a better integration of processes and\nfocusing on the producibility and affordability. There are\nmany different VR systems, crossing video games, gloves\nsystems, head-mounted display systems, Digital Mock-up\n(DMU), graphical computers and many others.\nWang [9] describes the DMU as a virtual prototyping\ntechnology that comprises the use of virtual reality and\nothers technologies to allow the building of the digital\nprototypes. The DMU is a 3D representation integrating all\nengineering, design, maintenance, and manufacturing\nrequirements.\nMcBeth et al [10] emphasised that DMU utilisation has\nimproved the sharing of data between the OEM and\nsupply base. The DMU, if used daily by the design teams,\ncan provide a dynamic representation of the current state\nof the product design evolution and employ to resolve\nissues. However, the main benefits are being gained in\nthe manufacturing areas due to the improved\ncommunication between design and manufacturing during\nthe design process. The DMU also provides benefits to\npredict the structural behaviour of a product, to forecast\nthe aerodynamics, to design and test complex systems, to\nanticipate human interaction with the product and to\npredict the effectiveness of the maintenance [11]. In terms\nof work, using the DMU mainly improves speed, schedule\nshortening, technical quality, concurrence engineering\napproach and costs reduction [12].\nTechnology is increasingly used by companies and\nworkers to help them to accomplish their daily tasks, to\ncommunicate with others and learn new competencies. To\nrespond to the consistent spreading of the companies and\nthe increasing numbers of suppliers, which need to work\non a same project with people around the world, a new\ntechnology is born: the virtual meeting room [13].\nThis virtual environment is a huge improvement in terms\nof technology and exchange of information as it\nincorporates the feeling of \u201cbeing there\u201d. Thus, this new\ntype of collaboration allows the user to directly interact\nwith the virtual environment as if it was a real room since\nit comprises audio, text communication, documents and\ncharacters [14, 15].\nSeveral companies as Intel, Raytheon, BP and HP have\nstarted to developed and used this type of virtual room.\nThey have even started to go further in the utilisation of\nthe virtual room by using it not only for meetings but also\nfor trainings, customers\u2019 relationship and private\ncollaboration. For these companies, this new technology\nhas unique advantages such as maintaining peoples\u2019\nattention, not feeling alone, seeing facial expressions,\ncollaborating in real time, and solving problems more\nquickly than with current tools [16, 17 ].\nHowever, this new technology is still expensive and in its\npioneering days. It appears quite difficult to use this virtual\nroom for the moment as its use is not enough instinctive\nand people need practice to navigate in the environment.\nBut within five years, the virtual room will certainly take the\nsame importance in the worker\u2019s life than the Web as it\nopens the world of the 3D Internet [13].\nThe literature review has highlighted that there is a lack of\nresearch projects focused on the enhancement of\nutilisation of digital data. Therefore this research project\nhas attempted to fill in this research gap by developing a\nset of recommendation to enhance the current utilisation\nof digital design data especially in the aerospace industry.\n3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.1 The Case Study Company\nAirbus is a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft in\nthe world through innovation, cultural diversity and\ncommitment. Specifically, Airbus in the UK is the centre of\nexcellence in the design and manufacturing of aircraft\nwings. The design office at Filton - one of six within\nAirbus \u2013 manages the design of all wings for the whole\nAirbus family of aircraft. It is also responsible for the\ndesign integration of the landing gears and fuel systems\n[18]. Within such a multicultural company, employees\nneed to work with partners and suppliers worldwide,\nexchanging knowledge, experience and ideas.\n3.2 The Approach Adopted\nThe research project commenced with a familiarization\nstage through the literature and the use of informal\ninterviews with key employees and regular visits to Airbus\nin the UK. The data collection focused on the processes,\nthe customers and the uses of digital design data. This\nphase allows identifying the users of digital data and\ncapturing their expectations and requirements. Figure 1\nillustrates the adopted research methodology.\nThe different opportunities for improvements in terms of\naccess and sharing of digital data have been identified\nthrough the data analysis phase.\nTo identify possible improvements in the utilisation of\ndigital data within the design process, the most important\nstep was to capture the requirements and expectations of\nthe employees. It was really important to understand what\nthey needed to achieve and the way they were actually\nworking in order to capture any possible requirements that\ncould help them to achieve their deliveries. Key\nrepresentatives in different disciplines and aircraft\nprograms were selected.\nA semi-structured questionnaire was employed in this\nstudy, characterized by five main areas of focus:\nintroduction, job description and tools used, access of\ndigital data, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and\nfacilities. The questionnaire was designed to capture the\nrole and responsibilities of the interviewee, their daily\ntasks and the tools they use to accomplish their work.\nFigure 1: The Research Methodology Adopted\nThe following are samples of the questions employed in this study:\n\uf0b7 What are the various tasks during your day to\nday job and what are the tools you need to\nachieve your job?\n\uf0b7 What kind of digital design data do you need to\naccess?\n\uf0b7 What kind of digital data do you need to extract?\n\uf0b7 From your point of view, what are the areas that\ncould be improved?\nIn order to capture the satisfactions and requirement of\nAirbus in the UK employees in the design process, fifteen\ninterviews were carried out with different aircraft program\nrepresentatives. The specific function representatives\ninterviewed were Designers, DMU Managers, Engineering\nProgram Managers, Lead Designers, Weight Engineers,\nStress Engineers, Senior Design Integrators and Head of\nProduct Enablement.\nFinally, the last phase represents the creation of a\nroadmap, giving a set of recommendations and\nimprovements necessary to improve the digital data use\nprocess. The roadmap was validated by a set of experts\npresent in the company in order to improve and accept\nthe proposed solutions.\nProcess Understanding\nProject\nDefinition &\nFamiliarization\nData Analysis\nData Collection\nRoadmap Development\nand validation\nPHASE I\nPHASE II\nPHASE IV\nPHASE III\nOutputs\n\uf0b7 Client Research Brief\n\uf0b7 Project Flyer\n\uf0b7 Familiarize with the\nfield of the project\nOutputs\n\uf0b7 Analysis of the\nexisting design\nprocess\n\uf0b7 Identify users\n\uf0b7 Capture their\nsatisfactions\nOutputs\n\uf0b7 Identify dependency\non KPIs\nOutputs\n\uf0b7 Develop Roadmap for\nimprovement\n\uf0b7 Validate Roadmap\nVisits to the\ncompany\nMeetings\nMeetings with\nengineers\nExpert\ninterviews\nTacit knowledge\nand experience\nInterviews\nInterviews\nQuestionnaires\nAnalysis of\nquestionnaire\nCompany\nvisits\n4 THE ROADMAP DEVELOPMENT\nThe roadmap has provided several areas for\nimprovement. This paper presents three areas, which are\nthe improved access to 3D models for stress engineers,\nthe DMU colouring and the use of a lightweight\nvisualization. There are another four areas of\nimprovement that can be obtained from Bouin-Portet [19].\nThese areas were selected based on the short-term\nimplementation, the technical feasibility and the rapid\nreturn on investment.\n4.1 The Stress Issue\nIn Airbus in the UK, not all stress engineers have direct\naccess to native 3D. The stress population has two\nspecific requirements in the access to the 3D model. They\nneed to have access to the 3D model for:\n\u2022 Visualizing the 3D Model such as Assemblies or\ncomponents in order to understand how it fits\ntogether. Thus, they need to have a global view\nof the model.\n\u2022 Obtaining components measurements and\ndimensions in order to perform the stress and\nfinite analysis. Therefore, they need to have\naccess to a Detailed View with a specific\naccuracy.\nHowever, the stress engineers may need to work with\nlarge volumes of 3D data. Therefore, they need\nassistance from designers who have CATIA access to find\nthe necessary 3D information for them. Accordingly, a\npossible lead-time improvement has been identified for\nboth the stress and the design population. Indeed, it was\nevaluated that stress engineers and designers could save\nbetween 2 and 2.5 hours per week by having a direct\naccess to the 3D model.\n4.1.1 Global View Solution\nFor the visualization requirement, two solutions were\ninvestigated: the use of a lightweight visualization format\nand the use of product view. A lightweight visualization is\na light-view format of the 3D Model, created from the\nCATIA Model. Product View is the software that allows\nseeing the 3D Model through a Product Data\nManagement (PDM) system. Both can allow the stress\nengineer to have a global view of the 3D model. After an\nin-depth study of both solutions, it appears that the best\nsolution is the use of the lightweight visualization format,\nas the Product View solution cannot visualize large\nassemblies, due to restriction of the PDM capabilities.\nThe use of a lightweight visualization will allow the user to\nhave a quick global view of the 3D model. Moreover, one\nof the most significant advantages to use such a format is\nthat a user does not need any training to access it. The\nuser needs only to install a viewer to visualize the files.\n4.1.2 Detailed View Solution\nFor the measurement requirement, the solution of\nlightweight visualization is not appropriate since it is not\naccurate enough. Thus, three different solutions were\ninvestigated: the use of CATIA, the use of the DMU and\nthe use of Product View. The conclusions of this\ninvestigation are the following:\n\u2022 The DMU turned out to be not enough accurate\nto take measurements.\n\u2022 CATIA could allow taking measurements but it\ninvolves at least a four full days training to get an\naccess and it seems complex for people who do\nnot use it daily.\n\u2022 Product View seems to be the good solution but\nthe accuracy needs to be checked.\nIn order to investigate if Product View has enough\naccuracy to obtain components measurements and\ndimensions, a test was carried out to understand the\nlimitations of Product View. Thus, a stress engineer\ncalculated the necessary measurements in CATIA and in\nProduct View in parallel for the same component in order\nto make a comparison in terms of measurement and ease\nof use.\nThe conclusions of using Product View were the following:\n\u2022 Component measurements can be obtained\nwithin 0.001 mm accuracy\n\u2022 Easy to do measurement\n\u2022 Quicker than CATIA to load a part\n\u2022 Just need a PC and not a Unix Station\nThe direct time saving of using both a lightweight\nvisualization and Product View was estimated at one hour\na week for the stress engineers and two hours a week for\nthe designers.\n4.2 The DMU Colour\nThe case study employees need to have an easy access\nto some information located in the Product Data\nManagement System. For instance, they would need to\nhave a global view on the maturity phase, the released\ninformation of components and assemblies to monitor the\ndesign progress, or they would need to identify the parts\nfrom a certain supplier. Moreover, they need to see this\ninformation at a part level visualizing at section such as\nthe Trailing Edge.\nNowadays, to access this kind of information, employees\nneed to extract it from the PDM system and transfer it in\nan Excel sheet. Then, they reorganize it in order to keep\nthe data they need and make the information easier to\nread. This is an inefficient process which can be improved\nupon through better integration between the data source\nand the visualization tools.\nThe solution proposed is to colour the DMU in order to\nhighlight any attribute required by the customer for\nexample, the different levels of maturity of design data\nand Data for Manufacturing (DFM) phase by parts or the\nparts according to a specific supplier.\nA script already exists to colour the DMU. However to\napply this macro, employees need to generate a KPI\ntable, open the DMU in CATIA, run the macro manually\nfrom the KPIs table and save the file in another folder. It is\nwhy the solution has not been deployed yet within Airbus\nin the UK. Thus, the goal is to automate the macro and\ncombine the results with the lightweight visualization to\nallow the management population and the non-CATIA\nspecialist to access easily this kind of information.\nThe use of the colour in the DMU will allow Airbus to gain\nsignificant time in review meetings and in their daily work,\nto have better tracking, control and monitoring, and to\nhave visual management in-line with a lean engineering\napproach. However, due to the nature of the requirements\nand benefits, it is quite difficult to quantify and measure\nthese savings in terms of time and money.\nThe implementation of the DMU colour solution will\nrequire achieving the following stages:\n\u2022 Automatic creation of KPIs in line with customers\nrequirements\n\u2022 Creation of a script to automate the macro\n\u2022 Save the files as lightweight visualization to\nmake it available to non CAD users\nIt will then be possible to colour the DMU with different\ncolour according to specific criteria and to make it\naccessible easily to the management population.\n4.3 The use of lightweight visualization\nThe lightweight visualization is an interactive visualization\ntool used in a PC environment. It allows a global view of\nthe 3D model in a non-CAD environment and\ncomplements the Digital Mock-Up. However it cannot\nassist structural analysis. The main audience of this tool\nare the non-CAD users, the management population and\nmost of the engineering population such as stress\nengineers, lead designers and program manager.\nNowadays, hundreds of people are currently using the\nlightweight visualization in a recent aircraft program.\nIn Airbus in the UK, the lightweight visualization files are\ncurrently created manually two or three times a week. The\nusers can access these files with user rights.\nThe proposed solution involves the following steps:\n\u2022 Automate the creation of lightweight visualization\nfiles by writing a script. It represents one to two\nweeks of work\n\u2022 To update the files every day\n\u2022 Create a portal or a Webpage to allow people to\naccess it and to get a better control\n\u2022 Communicate this new tool through Splash\nscreens, Team managers, Presentation in the\ndigital data sharing facilities\u2026\nThus, the first stage in the implementation of this solution\nwill involve the creation of a script to allow the automatic\ncreation of lightweight visualization at a section level.\nMany benefits are associated to the use of the lightweight\nvisualization format. A user does not need any software\napplication to access it and can visualize large geometry\nonce the files are created. To maintain data integrity and\nIntellectual Property Rights, the user cannot share the\nfiles easily by sending presentation for instance, which\nallows a better control and tracking of the information. The\nlightweight visualization can also allow visualising a\nparticular configuration, a product structure. Finally, one of\nthe most important advantages of such a format is that it\nallows to non-CAD users to gain an access to the 3D\nmodel with an ease of use and without any training,\nimproving communication, encouraging management in\n3D world, and supporting the concurrent engineering and\nsingle source approach of Airbus.\n5 VALIDATION\nThe Digital Wing team and the users of the digital design\ndata carried out the validation of the recommendations.\nHowever, a workshop with a set of 12 experts was\norganized to present the proposed solutions. DMU\nManagers, Mock-Up Integrators, PDM Support,\nApplication Support, Head of Product Enablement, Digital\nData Manager, Digital Data Capability and Enablement,\nand Digital Data Quality and Performance Managers were\ninvolved in this workshop. The workshop commenced with\npresenting the problems and the proposed solutions as\nwell as a discussion for each of the areas of focus.\nThe workshop members were enthusiastic and interested\nin the proposed improvements. Several issues of focus\nemerged from the discussion. For instance, for the stress\nissue; it appears important to find an official document\nproving that Product View has the right accuracy to allow\nmeasurements.\nThe DMU colouring is considered as really useful. The\nHead of Product Enablement \u201cThis solution shows that the\nDMU is really powerful but not used at its plain\ncapabilities\u201d. Some employees would like to implement\nthis information such as the materials to differentiate\nbetween metallic\/composite and supplier sources.\n6 ROADMAP IMPLEMENTATION: FIRST STEPS\nAfter the validation of the proposed roadmap, several\nsteps have started in preparation for the implementation\nof the DMU colour and the lightweight visualization\nchanges.\n6.1 DMU Colour\nIn order to develop an automated DMU colouring\ncapability, a pilot was presented against a sample dataset\nof an aircraft. To allow the development of a sample\ndataset, several tasks needed to be performed. First, a\nKPIs table was created automatically, including the part\nnumber associated to the stage of maturity or DFM. Then\na macro that was already created was applied to this KPIs\ntable. Finally, the files created were saved as lightweight\nvisualization to facilitate its access and make it available\nto non-CAD users. The DMU colour differentiated the\nparts that are released (Green), those that are waiting to\nbe released (Amber) and those that are in-work (Red).\n6.2 Use of lightweight visualization\nIn order to develop the lightweight visualization solution\nand to allow an easy access to the files, several actions\nhave been put in place. The technical side of the\nimplementation includes:\n\uf0b7 Formalizing a structure breakdown,\n\uf0b7 Setting up a secure space to store the files by\nlocking off the X-drive for a better control and\nsecurity,\n\uf0b7 Creating a script for CATIA to create the\nlightweight visualization files automatically,\n\uf0b7 Creating an interface for an intranet webpage.\nThe two first steps were performed. The third step is\nwaiting for being performed by the Data Exchange\nDepartment, which means that in short-term the files will\nbe created manually. The last step includes a specific\nrequest to allow the creation of the webpage. Finally, in\norder to deploy the tool, the communication chosen\nincludes a presentation to key managers with a demo in\nthe facilities available, emails and splash screens and\npossibly an article in the company internal magazine.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nThe roadmap to enhance the current utilisation of digital\ndesign data within the aerospace industry was presented.\nThere are opportunities to enhance the digital data\navailability in order to make better decision in a shorter\ntime to reduce the product lead-time.\nThe paper focuses on three main areas including the\nStress, the Digital Mock-Up (DMU) colour and the\npotential use of the lightweight visualization. The\nproposed solutions were developed and validated,\npresenting the best way to achieve the goal, considering\nthe short-term implementation necessary to get immediate\nbenefits and the technical feasibility of the new change.\nThe initial stages of implementing the developed roadmap\nhave commenced within Airbus in the UK. The main\nbenefit achieved by implementing the new solutions will\nbe time savings for the digital design data users.\n8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Airbus in the UK for\nsponsoring this project.
