Introduction\nAuroral precipitation processes have been extensively stud-\nied using optical imagers and riometers and more recently\nimaging riometers [e.g., Stauning, 1996a]. It has been long\nknown that some relationship between the optical aurora and\nionospheric absorption exists [e.g., Ansari, 1964; Campbell and\nLeinbach, 1961]. Observations of auroral optical emissions and\nabsorption give the spatial and temporal distribution of softer\n(\u000215 keV) [e.g., Burch, 1991; Belon et al., 1966] and harder\n(\u000425 keV) [e.g., Penman et al., 1979; Collis et al., 1984] pre-\ncipitating particles, respectively. The magnitude of the optical\nemissions and auroral absorption relate to the flux of precip-\nitating particles within the corresponding energy band. It has\nbeen amply demonstrated that there is a relationship between\nthe energy and flux of precipitating particles, which cause ion-\nization, and various auroral optical emissions [e.g., Robinson\nand Vondrak, 1994; Mende et al., 1984; Vondrak et al., 1983;\nSears and Vondrak, 1981; Vondrak and Sears, 1978]. However,\nall these studies were done with narrow fields of view, and\nthere have been no attempts to study the small-scale spatial\nand temporal morphology of the particle energies over a wide\nfield of view.\nIt is possible to infer the energy spectrum of precipitating\nelectrons by inverting the electron density altitude profile ob-\ntained from incoherent scatter radars [e.g., Kirkwood and Os-\nepian, 1995; del Pozo et al., 1997]. However, such radars gen-\nerally have a very small field of view (\u00021\u0003). Scanning the radar\nin order to expand the effective field of view is not useful as the\nslow moving antennae severely limit the temporal resolution\nachievable. Assuming one wishes to make a 24 \u0001 24 grid scan\nof the sky, even if the radar only spends 10 s at each position,\nincluding antenna moving time, it would still take 96 min to\ncomplete one scan. For auroral studies such a temporal reso-\nlution is wholly inadequate when phenomena are known to\noccur on timescales of less than a minute.\nThe flux and energy of precipitating electrons can be ob-\ntained from satellite observations [e.g., Ishimoto et al., 1988;\nRees et al., 1988], and global maps of these parameters have\nbeen produced [e.g., Hardy et al., 1985; Spiro et al., 1982].\nAlthough these plots have a very large coverage, they are\nstatistical averages of many satellite passes, which are unsuit-\nable for case studies. Empirical relationships between absorp-\ntion magnitude and the flux of high-energy particles measured\nby geostationary satellites have been found [e.g., Collis et al.,\n1984; Penman et al., 1979]. However, satellite data do not have\nthe spatial resolution in the ionosphere required for detailed\nstudies of the spatial morphology of the precipitating particle\nenergies, which is possible from the ground.\nCopyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union.\nPaper number 2001JA900107.\n0148-0227\/01\/2001JA900107$09.00\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 106, NO. A12, PAGES 28,925\u201328,937, DECEMBER 1, 2001\n28,925\nIn this paper a technique is developed to spatially expand\nthe point measurement made by an incoherent scatter radar\nusing a combination of two imaging instruments, i.e., an all-sky\nimager and an imaging riometer. Auroral optical emissions and\nabsorption are observed in the E region above 100 km and in\nthe D region below 95 km altitude, respectively, corresponding\nto two different parts of the energy spectrum, \u000215 keV for\naurora and \u000425 keV for absorption [Rees, 1963; Bailey, 1968;\ndel Pozo et al., 1997]. Assuming that the higher- and lower-\nenergy components come from the same source particle pop-\nulation, and assuming that the energy spectrum of the precip-\nitating particles can be described by a mathematical function\ncontaining only two unknown variables, the two observables\n(auroral intensity and absorption magnitude) can be related to\na single characteristic descriptor of the assumed energy spec-\ntral function. Once this empirical relationship is found, the\ncharacteristic descriptor of the energy spectrum can be com-\nputed for any part of the sky where the aurora and the absorp-\ntion are quantitatively measured simultaneously.\n2. Theory\nThe continuity equation for E region electron densities (Ne)\nmeasured at a given altitude is given by [Brekke et al., 1989]\ndNe\ndt \u0001 Qp \u0002 Qs \u0003 \u0004Ne\n2 \u0003 div \u0005Ne \u0001 \u0005\u0001 \u0006 , (1)\nwhere Qp is the ion production rate due to auroral precipita-\ntion, Qs is the ion production rate due to solar radiation, \u0004 is\nthe height-dependent effective recombination coefficient, \u0005\u0001 is\nthe electron bulk velocity, and t is time. Assuming it is night-\ntime (i.e., Qs \u0007 0), steady state conditions prevail (i.e., dNe\/\ndt \u0007 0), and that the transport term div (Ne \u0001 \u0005\u0001 ) becomes\nnegligible at D and lower E region altitudes when compared to\n\u0004Ne\n2 [Brekke et al., 1989], (1) simply becomes\n\u0004Ne\n2 \u0001 Qp. (2)\nAuroral particles bombarding the atmosphere will lose energy\nat the rate of \b35 eV per ion pair formed [Rees and Luckey,\n1974]. Upon recombination, only a small fraction (\b4%) of the\nenergy thus deposited results in spectroscopic emissions ob-\nservable from the ground [Rees and Luckey, 1974]. However,\nfor a given precipitation rate by particles of a certain energy, it\nis reasonable to expect the production of auroral photons to\nremain constant. To first order, we can assume that auroral\noptical intensity I is proportional to Qp. Hence, for E region\nelectron density variations associated with particle precipita-\ntion, we have\nNe \t \u0001I , (3)\nwhere \nI is a measure of the particle flux which generates the\nnighttime E region electron density. Total absorption A inte-\ngrated over the entire path L is given by [Hargreaves, 1969]\nA \u0001 4.6 \u0006 10\u000b5 \u0002\n0\n\f Ne\u0005\n\u00052 \u0002 \u0005\u0007 \b \u0007L\u0006\n2 dL \u0005dB\u0006 , (4)\nwhere Ne is the total electron density, \u0005 is the electron collision\nfrequency, \u0007 is the observation frequency, \u0007L \u0007 \u0007H cos \t , \u0007H\nis the gyrofrequency, \t is the angle between the magnetic field\nand propagation direction, and \r implies the extraordinary\n(\u000b) and ordinary (\u000e) wave, respectively. By subtracting the\nquiet day curves from the riometer data [Browne et al., 1995],\nit is possible to determine the absorption primarily due to\nparticle precipitation only. Theoretical calculations show that\nabsorption is directly related to the flux of incident electrons,\nwith higher energies producing more absorption [Bailey, 1968].\nIn the auroral zone, D region absorption dominates. To first\norder, (4) reduces to\nA (dB) \t Ne (5)\nin the D layer. Hence absorption is a measure of the particle\nflux which generates the nighttime D region electron density.\ndel Pozo et al. [1997] have found that the effective deposition\naltitude for precipitating electrons can be related to their en-\nergy by\nE\u0005H\u0006 \u0001 4 \u0006 105e\u000b0.101H \u0005keV\u0006 , (6)\nwhere H is altitude in kilometers. The primary influx of parti-\ncle energy into the auroral atmosphere is carried by electrons\nwith energies between 1 and 10 keV [Burch, 1991]. Optical\naurora normally occurs above 100 km altitude [Currie, 1955;\nSto\u00a8rmer, 1955], resulting from precipitating electrons with en-\nergies E \u0002 15 keV [Rees, 1963; del Pozo et al., 1997]. For\nexample, E \u000f 10 keV implies an altitude of H \u000f 105 km in\nthe E region. Riometer absorption normally occurs below 95\nkm [Penman et al., 1979], resulting from precipitating electrons\nwith energies E \u0004 25 keV [Rees, 1963; del Pozo et al., 1997].\nFor example, E \u000f 47 keV implies an altitude of H \u000f 90 km\nin the D region.\nMany early observations with single-beam riometers and\nphotometers have established that fluctuations in auroral op-\ntical intensity are correlated to variations in absorption mag-\nnitude [e.g., Ansari, 1964; Campbell and Leinbach, 1961; Eather\nand Jacka, 1966; Gustafsson, 1964, 1969; Holt and Omholt,\n1962], although Barcus [1965] also found evidence of uncorre-\nlated behavior. Stoker et al. [1996] found a similar correlation\nfor the central narrow beams of an imaging riometer and the\ncorresponding regions in auroral all-sky images, although the\nbest correlation occurred for spatially adjacent regions. Ac-\ncording to Rees [1963], ion production Qp is linearly related to\nthe flux of precipitating particles (F), whereas ion production\nis proportional to the square of the resulting electron density\n(see equation (2)). Assuming that the hard and soft energy\ncomponents of the electron precipitation are from the same\nsource population, and that the energy distribution remains\nconstant, then\nA\n\u0001I \t\nNe\u0005H \n 96 km\u0006\nNe\u0005H \u000b 101 km\u0006\n\t\n\u0001F\u0005E \u000b 25 keV\u0006\n\u0001F\u0005E \n 15 keV\u0006 . (7)\nEquation (7) implies\nE \t\nA\n\u0001I , (8)\nwhere A\/\nI is independent of flux. The ratio of absorption to\nsquare root of optical intensity is an energy indicator for the\nprecipitating electrons. Theoretical analysis shows the energy\nindicator to be quasilinearly dependent on energy [Johansen,\n1965a; Bailey, 1968]. Experiments using photometers and sin-\ngle-beam riometers seem to confirm this [Eather and Jacka,\n1966]; however, the empirical relationship may be different for\nindividual cases [Johansen, 1965b]. A major problem with the\nearly work was that the single-beam riometers generally have a\nKOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS28,926\ngreater field of view (\u000415\u0003) compared to photometers (\u000210\u0003).\nUsing a single-beam riometer and photometer at 557.7 nm,\nBerkey [1968] and Gustafsson [1969] used the energy indicator\nto infer changes of the incident flux spectrum; however, they\nlacked any means to calibrate these measurements into units of\nenergy.\nAn energy distribution function of the form\nF\u0005E\u0006 \u0001 kE\fe\u000bE\/E0 (9)\nhas been found to represent closely many observed primary\nauroral flux spectra [Rees, 1989], where F is flux, k is a constant\nof proportionality, E is energy, and E0 is the characteristic\nenergy. For \f \u0007 0 an exponential function is obtained, and for\n\f \u0007 1 a Maxwellian distribution is obtained. Satellite [e.g., Lui\net al., 1977; Hardy et al., 1985] and rocket [e.g., Ogilvie, 1968;\nWesterlund, 1969; Arnoldy et al., 1974; Lundin, 1976; Maynard et\nal., 1977] measurements indicate that the energy spectrum of\nelectrons incident on the atmosphere can be reasonably de-\nscribed by a Maxwellian distribution, or by an exponential\nfunction if the low-energy part of the spectrum (typically \u00021\nkeV) is ignored. However, such spectral functions are not\nalways good fits [e.g., Evans, 1968; Whalen and McDiarmid,\n1972].\nIn this study we test both functional forms of (9). Assuming\nthe hard and soft electron precipitation is from the same\nsource population and that the energy spectral shape remains\nconstant, we define for the Maxwellian distribution (\f \u0007 1)\nF\u0005E\u0006 I \u0001 kIEIe\u000bEI\/E0 \t \u0001I , (10)\nfor optical aurora I from the derivation of (3), and\nF\u0005E\u0006A \u0001 kAEAe\u000bEA\/E0 \t A , (11)\nfor auroral absorption A from the derivation of (5). Defining\nthe energy indicator from (8) gives\nA\n\u0001I \u0001\nF\u0005E\u0006A\nF\u0005E\u0006 I\n. (12)\nSubstituting (10) and (11) into (12) and rearranging gives\nln \u0003 A\u0001I\u0004 \u0001 ln \u0003 kAkI\u0004 \u0002 ln \u0003EAEI\u0004 \u0002 \u0005EI \u0003 EA\u0006 1E0 , (13)\nwhich is equivalent to the straight line equation\nY \u0001 C \u0002 MX , (14)\nwhere the offset C is the two natural logarithm terms put\ntogether and the slope M \u0007 EI \u000b EA. Importantly, A , \nI,\nand E0 can be measured by a riometer, an optical imager, and\nincoherent scatter radar, respectively, which allows the un-\nknown terms C and M to be determined empirically. Once\nthese are known for any one point in space, (14) can be applied\nto the entire sky, thereby generating a map of E0 from wide\nfield-of-view measurements of A and \nI. For the Maxwellian\ndistribution the average energy E\u0001 is given by\nE\u0001 \u0001 2E0. (15)\nThe entire derivation can easily be repeated for an assumed\nexponential energy spectral function (\f \u0007 0 in equation (9)),\nresulting in\nln \u0003 A\u0001I\u0004 \u0001 ln \u0003 kAkI\u0004 \u0002 \u0005EI \u0003 EA\u0006 1E0 , (16)\nwith\nE\u0001 \u0001 E0. (17)\n3. Instrumentation\nThree instruments with overlapping fields of view are essen-\ntial to producing calibrated energy maps. The Imaging Riom-\neter for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) is located at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nFinland (69.05\u0003N, 20.79\u0003E). This imaging riometer [Browne et\nal., 1995] has 49 beams, operates continuously at 38.2 MHz,\nand samples all beams once per second. The raw beam data are\ninterpolated into a geographic projection for 90 km altitude at\na spatial resolution of 10 \u0001 10 km, corresponding to 0.1\u0003\nlatitude and 0.25\u0003 longitude, for an area of 67.8\u0003\u201370.2\u0003N and\n17.75\u0003\u201323.75\u0003E, which covers 240 \u0001 240 km. The techniques\nand uses of imaging riometers have been summarized by\nStauning [1996b].\nThe Digital All-Sky Imager (DASI) is located at Skibotn,\nNorway (69.35\u0003N, 20.36\u0003E). This auroral imager [Kosch et al.,\n1998] operates with an interference filter which only passes the\nO1S emission at 557.7 nm and has been calibrated into units of\nabsolute rayleighs [Baker, 1974]. This feature is crucial to the\nsuccessful calibration of the characteristic energy outlined ear-\nlier. The O1S auroral emission is generally the brightest of the\nauroral emissions [Vallance Jones, 1991] with a maximum in-\ntensity around 100 km altitude [Sto\u00a8rmer, 1955; Currie, 1955].\nDASI operates only during the winter for all dark and moon-\nfree periods, amounting to \b1500 recording hours per year.\nThe raw image data are integrated for 10 s and then projected\nonto a geographic grid at 100 km altitude. A spatial resolution\nof 10 \u0001 10 km is used for an area of 67.6\u0003\u201372.6\u0003N and 13.5\u0003\u2013\n26.0\u0003E, which covers 520 \u0001 520 km.\nThe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) facility is lo-\ncated at Ramfjordmoen, Norway (69.59\u0003N, 19.23\u0003E). The part\nof the facility used in this study is a tristatic UHF radar oper-\nating at 933 MHz [Rishbeth and van Eyken, 1993] with a beam\naperture of \b0.6\u0003. The radar can directly measure ion and\nelectron temperature, ion velocity, and electron density. In this\nstudy, only the electron density altitude profiles are used. EIS-\nCAT is operated for \b2500 hours per year, and electron den-\nsity is typically measured in the height range \b60\u2013587 km.\nCommon Program 1 (CP1) measures parallel to the magnetic\nfield line (zenith angle \b13\u0003S) with a time resolution of 5 s;\nhowever, the data are usually postintegrated to 60 s in order to\nimprove the signal to noise ratio.\nFigure 1 shows the geographic arrangement of IRIS, DASI,\nand EISCAT overlaid on a map of northern Scandinavia. The\nlarge and small trapezia are the processed fields of view of\nDASI and IRIS, respectively. The 49 ellipses are the IRIS\nbeams projected to 90 km altitude. The dot is EISCAT\u2019s po-\nsition mapped up the magnetic field line to 100 km altitude.\n4. Results and Discussion\nThe data presented here come from two EISCAT CP1 runs\non February 13, 1996, and November 9, 1998. Any clouds\npresent in the sky have been identified since they ruin DASI\u2019s\nabsolute optical intensity measurement. Ionospheric scintilla-\ntions observed by IRIS as a result of a strong radio source (e.g.,\n28,927KOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS\nCassiopeia) in one of the beams increase the error in the\nabsorption measurement. Excluding periods of cloud from\nDASI and removing beams with scintillations from the IRIS\ndata, all three experiments had good data simultaneously for\n2006\u20130020 and 1742\u20132200 UT on the nights of February 13,\n1996, and November 9, 1998, respectively. In the periods in-\nvestigated, Kp was in the range 2\u000e\u20134\u000b and 4\u000e\u20136\u000e for Febru-\nary 13, 1996, and November 9, 1998, respectively, providing a\ngood spread in geomagnetic activity. It is important that two\nindependent data sets are combined to ensure that any empir-\nical relationship between the characteristic energy of the cho-\nsen distribution function and the energy indicator is not a\nspecial case.\nPlates 1 and 2 present the raw and processed data for the\nFebruary 13, 1996, and November 9, 1998, data sets, respec-\ntively. Plates 1a and 2a show the electron density altitude\nprofile measured by EISCAT in the altitude range 60\u2013340 km\nwith a 60 s temporal resolution. Uncolored entries indicate no\ndata. Electron densities are extracted from the radar backscat-\ntered power profile, which is primarily a function of electron\ndensity, with a spatial resolution of 3 km. In the F and E\nregions down to 87 km the electron density is compensated for\nthe ratio of electron to ion temperatures. In the D region\nbetween 87 and 60 km it is assumed that the ion and electron\ntemperatures are equal. This is a good assumption in the D\nregion because of the higher collision frequencies. The effects\nof the electron to ion temperature ratio, Debye length, and\nnegative ions on the measured electron density are given by del\nPozo et al. [1999]. From Plates 1a and 2a it is clear that there\nis significant ionization from particle precipitation down to 100\nkm altitude and lower, indicating the presence of aurora and\nabsorption.\nPlates 1b and 2b show the equivalent energy spectra of the\nprecipitating electrons and are obtained by inverting the data\nof Plates 1a and 2a [del Pozo et al., 1997]. The inversion has\nbeen done for energies in the range 0.8\u2013380.5 keV with 29\nsteps. Above 160 keV the energy fluxes are essentially in the\nnoise and are not shown. From (6), 0.8\u2013160 keV corresponds\nto an altitude range of 129.9\u201377.5 km, which covers most of the\n557.7 nm auroral emission and absorption altitudes. Uncolored\nentries correspond to no fit. Conceptually, the inversion is\ndone by adjusting the flux of each one of the 29 mono-\nenergetic beams which have been defined until the integral of\nall 29 ionization profiles, one for each energy, is equal to the\nelectron density profile measured by EISCAT. Theoretical ion-\nization profiles for mono-energetic beams of electrons have\nbeen computed [e.g., Rees, 1963], but these depend on the\nmodel atmosphere assumed. For the inversion the Sodankyla\u00a8\nion chemistry model [Turunen et al., 1992] is used which de-\nscribes the chemical composition of the D and E regions. This\natmospheric model includes 24 and 11 positive and negative\nions, respectively, and takes into account over 175 chemical\nreactions. We believe it is the most complete representation of\nthe lower ionosphere currently available.\nPlates 1c and 2c show the Maxwellian characteristic energy\nE0. This curve is obtained by least squares fitting the Max-\nwellian distribution function (see equation (9) for \f\u0007 1) to the\ndata shown in Plates 1b and 2b. This is done independently for\neach time increment. A flux threshold of 102 (keV.cm2.sr.s)\u000b1\nhas been imposed on the fitting algorithm to eliminate those\nenergies which introduce much noise. This effectively corre-\nsponds to the detection limit of EISCAT. Plates 1b and 2b\nshow that most of the significant flux occurs at energies less\nthan 80 keV. At higher energies the flux is mostly many orders\nof magnitude lower. It is possible to fit a Maxwellian function\nwith high confidence in virtually all instances. A three-point\nrunning median filter has been applied to the data in Plates 1c\nand 2c in order to remove the few obviously poor fits. Com-\nparing Plates 1b and 2b with Plates 1c and 2c, it is obvious that\nthe fluctuations in characteristic energy are correct. The com-\nFigure 1. A geographic map of northern Scandinavia showing the field of view of the Digital All-Sky Imager\n(DASI) processed data (large trapezium), the field of view of the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies\n(IRIS) processed data (small trapezium), the IRIS beam pattern projected up to 90 km altitude (ellipses), and\nthe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar\u2019s position projected up the magnetic field line to 100 km\naltitude.\nKOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS28,928\nparison is most clear for fluxes in the energy band 3.5\u201340 keV.\nGreater fluxes at higher energies, or conversely lower fluxes at\nsmaller energies, result in a larger characteristic energy, and\nvice versa.\nPlates 1d and 2d show the absorption over EISCAT from\nIRIS. Since there is no single narrow beam riometer beam\navailable over EISCAT (see Figure 1), the absorption value is\ndetermined by interpolation and suitable weighting of the sur-\nrounding IRIS beams. The data have been subjected to a\nrunning three-point median filter to remove noise. Comparing\nPlates 1b and 2b with Plates 1d and 2d, variations in absorption\nrelate well to the flux of electrons in the energy band 25\u201380\nkeV. This is consistent with previous assumptions and obser-\nvations discussed earlier. The zenith angle from IRIS to 90 km\naltitude above EISCAT is 40\u0003. Rocket measurements through\nthe absorption region indicate that the layer is \b20 km thick\n[Friedrich and Torkar, 1983]. For a uniform layer of finite\nthickness the riometer reading would be 30% too large com-\npared to the vertical. This obliquity factor has been compen-\nsated for in the data processing.\nPlates 1e and 2e show the square root of optical intensity at\n557.7 nm over EISCAT from DASI. The imager has sufficient\nresolution to measure the auroral optical intensity over EIS-\nCAT directly. The data have been subjected to a running\nthree-point median filter to remove noise. One of the problems\nwith ground-based auroral imaging from one site only is that\nthe vertical extent of auroral forms can be large (up to 100 km\nor more). Since DASI is not colocated with EISCAT, any\nvertical extent will appear in effectively the wrong horizontal\nposition for an assumed auroral altitude of 100 km. The prob-\nlem is limited because auroral forms tend to be east-west\naligned, and DASI is mostly eastward of EISCAT. However,\nthe imager will integrate all optical emissions along the line of\nsight. The zenith angle from DASI to 100 km altitude above\nEISCAT is 25\u0003, introducing an error of 10% compared to the\nvertical. Since we use the square root of optical intensity (see\nequation (8)), the systematic error reduces to 5%, which is\nsmall compared to the problem of variable emission height and\nvertical extent of the aurora (discussed below) and is ignored.\nFor the data sets used in this study a three-dimensional (3-D)\ntomographic reconstruction of the aurora is not possible due to\nthe lack of additional suitably located imagers.\nPlates 1f and 2f show the ratio of absorption to square root\nof optical intensity. The energy indicator (see equation (8)) is\ngenerated from the curves shown in Plates 1d and 2d as well as\nPlates 1e and 2e. Equation (13) predicts a logarithmic rela-\ntionship between the energy indicator in Plates 1f and 2f and\nthe Maxwellian characteristic energy in Plates 1c and 2c. Com-\nparing Plates 1c and 2c and Plates 1f and 2f, the curves have a\nremarkably similar shape, and the fluctuations with time cor-\nrelate rather well although not all details are identical. For\nexample, at 2100 UT on February 13, 1996 (Plate 1), the peak\nin energy indicator (Plate 1f) is much narrower than that in\ncharacteristic energy (Plate 1c). Also, the steady rise in char-\nacteristic energy between 2130 and 2300 UT is not well repro-\nduced by the energy indicator. On November 9, 1998 (Plate 2),\nthe peaks in characteristic energy (Plate 2c) centered around\n1830 and 2030 UT exist in the energy indicator plot (Plate 2f)\nbut are not well reproduced in relative magnitudes.\nComparing the characteristic energy energies extracted from\nEISCAT data with past experiments involving riometers or\noptical imagers is difficult due to substantial differences in the\nexperiments. In the past mostly wide beam riometers were\nused, no studies of the absolute 557.7 nm emission intensity\nversus energy seem to be available, and certainly no quantita-\ntive experiments were performed which combined riometer,\noptical imager, and incoherent scatter radar data. Coordinated\nstudies between IRIS and EISCAT have been performed,\nwhere EISCAT electron density data have been inverted into\nflux spectra [e.g., Collis et al., 1996; Collis and Hargreaves,\n1997]. However, these studies did not attempt to find any\nempirical relationship between the observables of EISCAT,\nDASI, and IRIS. For comparison purposes we limit ourselves\nto a few previous EISCAT riometer observations, which have\nsimilar Kp values to February 13, 1996, and November 9, 1998.\nBurns et al. [1990] used EISCAT and wide-beam riometers to\nstudy substorm onset. Several riometers were located in north-\nern Scandinavia, but none was colocated with EISCAT. Expo-\nnential functions were fitted to the energy spectra inferred\nfrom EISCAT data although sometimes the data clearly had\ndifferent spectral shapes. For one substorm (Kp \u0007 4\u000e), ab-\nsorption varied in the range 1\u20132 dB, depending on the riometer\nused, with the exponential characteristic energy (E0) in the\nrange 2\u20136 keV. For another substorm (Kp \u0007 3\u000e) the values\nare in the ranges 0\u20132 dB and 5\u201312 keV. We convert between\nexponential and Maxwellian characteristic energies using (15)\nand (17). For the substorm onset at\b2105 UT on February 13,\n1996 (see Plate 1), the absorption over EISCAT varied in the\nrange 0.2\u20130.9 dB with the Maxwellian E0 in the range 2.3\u20136.5\nkeV, corresponding to an exponential E0 of 4.6\u201313 keV. For\nthe substorm onset \b2030 UT on November 9, 1998 (see Plate\n2), the absorption was 0.1\u20131 dB with the Maxwellian E0 \u0007\n2.5\u20136.5 keV, corresponding to an exponential E0 \u0007 5\u201313\nkeV. Despite significant differences in the experiments, our\nresults compare favorably with Burns et al. [1990]. Hargreaves\nand Devlin [1990] have studied morning sector electron pre-\ncipitation using EISCAT and a colocated wide-beam riometer.\nExponential functions were also fitted to the energy spectra\ninferred from EISCAT data. During a nonsubstorm period\nthey recorded absorption at \u00020.8 dB and found the exponen-\ntial E0 \u0007 4\u201314 keV, corresponding to a Maxwellian E0 \u0007 2\u20137\nkeV. For similar nonsubstorm periods, with absorption \u00020.8\ndB, we have a Maxwellian E0 \u0007 2.5\u20137 keV on February 13,\n1996 (see Plate 1) and E0 \u0007 2\u20134 keV on November 9, 1998\n(see Plate 2). Despite the different riometer types and time\nsectors, our results compare favorably with Hargreaves and\nDevlin [1990]. We conclude that our data analysis is consistent\nwith previous results.\nPlate 3 shows comparisons of IRIS absorption and DASI\noptical intensity with EISCAT derived incident fluxes of elec-\ntrons in two energy bands. Plates 3a and 3b refer to February\n13, 1996, whereas Plates 3c and 3d are for November 9, 1998.\nPlates 3a and 3c show the square (see equation (7)) of absorp-\ntion amplitude (red curve) and the flux of precipitating parti-\ncles integrated over the energy range 28.3\u2013 80 keV (blue\ncurve). From (6) the selected energy range corresponds to an\naltitude range of 94.6\u201384.3 km, which encompasses the ex-\npected height range for absorption. For both data sets the pairs\nof curves have a very similar time variation throughout, indi-\ncating that the selected energy (alternatively altitude) range is\ncorrect. Including energies greater than 80 keV makes virtually\nno difference as the fluxes are generally very small here (see\nPlates 1 and 2). Including energies lower than 28.3 keV makes\nthe comparison worse. For both data sets there is an increase\nin the offset between the pairs of curves after a sudden spike in\nabsorption at \b2105 and \b2030 UT on February 13, 1996\n28,929KOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS\n(Plate 3a), and November 9, 1998 (Plate 3c), respectively,\nindicating a hardening of the energy of the precipitating elec-\ntrons. Both these times correspond to substorm onset accord-\ning to the magnetometer records. This can be seen in Plates 1b\nand 2b as an increased flux at energies greater than\b30 and 20\nkeV on February 13, 1996, and November 9, 1998, respectively.\nPlates 3b and 3d show the optical intensity at 557.7 nm\n(green curve) and the flux of precipitating particles integrated\nover the range 8.4\u201314.1 keV (blue curve). From (6) the se-\nlected energy range corresponds to an altitude range of 106.6\u2013\n101.5 km, which is the expected altitude range for the lower\nborder of auroral forms where the optical intensity generally\nmaximizes [Currie, 1955; Sto\u00a8rmer, 1955]. The pairs of curves do\nnot have a very convincing similarity. Adjusting the energy\nrange integrated over does not bring any improvement. On\nclose inspection, it is realized that significant up and down\nswings in the flux curves (blue) are also accompanied by similar\nmovements in the optical intensity (green). However, there is\nno simple clear relationship between the magnitude of the flux\nfluctuations and optical variations. It is as if the \u201cAC\u201d compo-\nnent is the same but the \u201cDC\u201d component is not. This implies\nthat the offset between pairs of curves is not constant for long\nperiods of time as was the case for absorption (see Plates 3a\nand 3c). One possible cause is that the effective altitude and\nheight extent of the aurora at 557.7 nm are much more variable\nthan that for absorption. This is easily confirmed by inspecting\n(6). At the lower energies typical for aurora, a step change in\nenergy produces a much greater height variation than would be\nthe case for the same change at higher energies typical for\nabsorption. For example, in the case of aurora, changing the\nenergy by 3 keV from 9 to 12 keV will produce a height change\nof 2.9 km. The same change of energy for absorption from 40\nto 43 keV produces an altitude change of only 0.7 km. The\ncomparison gets exponentially worse for lower energies (or\ngreater altitudes). This means that the total path length over\nwhich the line-of-sight optical data are integrated by DASI will\nvary according to changes in the precipitating particle energy\nspectrum. This will also give rise to changes in the apparent\nintensity of the optical emission, which do not relate purely to\nchanges in the particle flux. The point illustrates one of the\nproblems of using the optical aurora. Unfortunately, no other\nsuitable wavelength is necessarily more stable in altitude. In\nprinciple, the problem could be solved by using multiple im-\nagers for tomography; however, this is generally impractical.\nMeasurements of the auroral excitation efficiency at 557.7\nnm [Steele and McEwen, 1990] reveal variations between 0.67\nand 1.7 kR erg\u000b1 cm\u000b2 s\u000b1. Hence, even for a fixed precipi-\ntating energy flux, a significant uncertainty (up to a factor of\n2.5) in optical emission intensity exists, which is due to small\nchanges in the precipitating electron energy spectrum and at-\nmospheric composition. Another potential source of error is\nthe breakdown of the steady state assumption for (2). Clearly,\ndNe\/dt \u0007 0 is not always strictly true and may account for the\nchanges in offset between the two curves in Plates 3b and 3d,\nespecially during substorms. Likewise, neglecting the transport\nterm div (Ne \u0001 \u0005\u0001 ) in (2) may introduce errors, especially during\ngeomagnetically active periods. In addition, the flux of high-\nenergy particles, which generate the absorption layer, will also\ncontribute to the optical aurora as they have to pass through\nthe E region to reach the D layer. Although the ionization\ncurves of Rees [1963] indicate that most of the energy for hard\nparticles will be deposited in the D region, up to 25% will be\nlost above 100 km. However, the flux in the energy range\n8.4\u201314.1 keV is about an order of magnitude greater than that\nin the range 28.3\u201380 keV. Hence the particles responsible for\nproducing absorption will contribute only a few percent (25%\nof 10% \u0007 2.5%) to the optical emission. Attempts to subtract\nthe higher-energy flux from the lower-energy flux in order to\nimprove the comparison of optical intensity with incident elec-\ntron flux (Plates 3b and 3d) have not been helpful. Given that\nvariations in the altitude and vertical extent of the aurora\npresent a potentially much more serious problem, this effect\nhas been ignored. The 557.7 nm oxygen emission (O1S) is the\nbrightest and most prevalent of all the auroral emissions [Val-\nlance Jones, 1991]. Given the lack of any other more suitable\noptical emission in the E layer, O1S is used in this work despite\nthe problems noted above.\nAdditional sources of uncertainty include the absolute cali-\nbration of DASI [Kosch et al., 1998], receiver stability for IRIS\n[Browne et al., 1995], and errors in the EISCAT data inversion\n[del Pozo et al., 1997]. For IRIS, DASI, and EISCAT these\nuncertainties are 0.04 dB, \u000220%, and \u000210%, respectively.\nErrors in determining the IRIS quiet day curve by computer\nalgorithm are estimated to be \u00020.07 dB, although manual\nadjustment can achieve 0.01 dB [Browne et al., 1995]. The data\npresented in Plates 1c and 2c and Plates 1f and 2f have been\ncombined into a scatterplot, which is shown in Figure 2. A total\nof 436 points from both data sets are included. Absorption and\noptical data with an absolute value less than 0.07 dB and 100 R,\nrespectively, have been rejected since these data are below the\neffective detection threshold of the instruments. The removal\nof these data is important since very low optical intensities will\nmake the energy indicator A\/\nI go to infinity (see equation\n(8)) whereas very low absorption values will make ln ( A\/\nI)\ngo to negative infinity (see equation (13)). Only riometer data\nfrom November 9, 1998, are affected with a total of 51 data\npoints being rejected. The axes of Figure 2 are chosen such\nthat fitting (13) will produce a straight line in the scatterplot.\nThe least squares fit of (13) is shown as the solid line with the\ndashed and dotted lines representing one and two standard\ndeviations, respectively. The equation of the fit is\nY \u0001 \u000b8.8X \u0002 1.0, (18)\nwhere Y \u0007 ln ( A\/\nI) and X \u0007 1\/E0 with E0 as the Max-\nwellian characteristic energy.\nA useful cross-check is to inspect the slope of (13), i.e., EA \u000b\nEI \u0007 8.8, which represents the difference in Maxwellian char-\nacteristic energy between the absorption and optical emission.\nBearing in mind that the average energy is twice the Max-\nwellian characteristic energy (see equation (15)), the average\nenergy difference between the incident particles producing\nabsorption (E\u0001 A) and the optical aurora (E\u0001 I) is E\u0001 A \u000b E\u0001 I \u0007\n17.6 keV. This is consistent: For typical optical energies of\n\u000215 keV, the absorption energies would be \u000232.6 keV on\naverage. This corresponds well with the curves shown in Plate\n3, bearing in mind that the average is biased to lower energies\nbecause of the very much lower particle flux at higher energies.\nIt seems obvious that the problems of the variable altitude and\nheight extent of the optical aurora and nonconstant photon\nproduction efficiency, discussed earlier, will contribute to the\nspread in the distribution of Figure 2. In addition, for active\nperiods the assumptions used in going from (1) to the simpli-\nfication of (2) may temporarily break down. This is likely dur-\ning substorm onsets, which occurred in both data sets. It is also\nclear that the curve fit would benefit from more data, especially\nfor greater 1\/E0.\nKOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS28,930\nPlate 1.

This is not surprising as pho-\ntometrically clear viewing is required in order to measure the\noptical intensity correctly without any scattering or absorbing\neffects. Cloud results in the affected data points being placed\nerroneously higher up the Y axis (toward less negative values),\nwhich causes the fit of (13) to have a much too small slope.\nCloud will limit the periods of possible energy map production.\nIf the entire fitting procedure described above is repeated for\nan assumed exponential energy spectral function (see equation\n(9) for \f \u0007 0), then fitting (16) to the scatterplot (not shown)\ngives\nY \u0001 \u000b11.0X \u0002 0.9. (19)\nFor the exponential distribution the characteristic energy is\nequal to the average energy (see equation (17)). Hence the\nslope of (19) gives E\u0001 A \u000b E\u0001 I \u0007 11.0 keV. The average energy\ndifference between the incident particles producing absorption\nand the optical aurora is 11.0 keV, which is less than that for\nthe Maxwellian distribution. The smaller difference is less re-\nalistic and probably stems from the less realistic representation\nof an exponential function, especially at low energies. We con-\nclude that the Maxwellian distribution is the better choice.\nFinally, we show an example of applying (18) to image for-\nmat data, which is the ultimate goal of the work presented\nhere. Plate 4 shows DASI, IRIS, and Maxwellian characteristic\nenergy maps for the geographic area of 67.8\u0003\u201370.2\u0003N and\n17.75\u0003\u201323.75\u0003E. The images are in plan view with north and\neast being up and right, respectively. The data comes from\nFebruary 13, 1996, in the interval 2035\u20132054 UT with 1 min\ntime increments and 10 \u0001 10 km spatial resolution. Magne-\ntometer data indicate that a substorm onset occurred at 2035\nUT. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to perform\na full detailed analysis of this event, some interesting points are\nnoted. In this example the auroral arc is latitudinally thin\ncompared to the more diffuse absorption region, and the op-\ntical emission occurs poleward of the absorption region. In the\nperiod 2040\u20132044 UT there is a very clear reduction in char-\nacteristic energy for the optical arc. After 2045 UT the absorp-\ntion shows an arc-like feature concurrent with the optical arc in\naddition to a broad diffuse region to the southeast. Corre-\nspondingly, the characteristic energy map no longer shows the\noptical arc to be well defined as a channel of reduced energy.\nHardy et al. [1985] and Spiro et al. [1982] have produced global\nstatistical maps of the average energy of precipitating electrons\nfor various Kp and Ae values, respectively. Although a detailed\ncomparison with Plate 4 is impossible because of the different\ntime and spatial scales as well as the substorm onset, it is worth\nnoting that they predict an average energy of \b3 keV, which\ncorresponds rather well with our estimate of E0 \u000f 2 keV, or\nequivalently average E\u0001 \u000f 4 keV, for the background region\nfurthest away from any significant particle precipitation (see\nnorthwest corner of energy plots in Plate 4 after 2045 UT).\nThe energy maps require the viewer to reinterpret the image\ninformation presented. The familiar images of all-sky optical\naurora and imaging riometer absorption are flux indicators for\ndifferent energy ranges. The energy maps presented in Plate 4\ndo not relate to the absolute flux magnitude of the precipitat-\ning particles at all. Very weak and exceptionally strong fluxes\ncan produce identical maps of characteristic energy. It is the\nrelative flux intensity of the hard and soft components of a\nbroad spectrum of incident particles that is highlighted in the\nenergy maps. A good example of this occurs at 2049\u20132050 UT,\nwhere there is a sudden decrease in optical intensity and ab-\nsorption without any significant change in the morphology of\nthe energy map. It is clear from just the one example shown in\nPlate 4 that the maps of characteristic energy open up new\npossibilities for interpreting auroral phenomena.\nThe 557.7 nm auroral emission and absorption account for\nelectron energies precipitating into the E and D regions, re-\nspectively, corresponding to energies of\u00041 keV. The existence\nof the 630 nm auroral emission, which occurs predominantly in\nthe F region, clearly indicates a significant flux of precipitating\nparticles at energies \u00021 keV. Plates 1a and 2a show that there\nis a significant electron density in the F layer, which sometimes\nmay even be dominant (e.g., 2050 UT on November 9, 1998).\nThis is confirmed by satellite [e.g., Frank and Ackerson, 1971;\nLui et al., 1977] and rocket data [e.g., Ogilvie, 1968; Westerlund,\n1969; Arnoldy et al., 1974; Maynard et al., 1977]. Energy spectra\nof incident electrons can also be deduced from combining\nground-based observations of several optical emissions [Rob-\ninson and Vondrak, 1994]. In order to improve the calibration\nof the energy maps, especially at lower energies where Figure\n2 has a sparsity of data, it is necessary to image auroral emis-\nsions at 630 nm. Such an upgrade is planned for DASI.\n5. Conclusions\nFor the first time, ground-based high-resolution maps of the\ncharacteristic energy of precipitating auroral electrons have\nbeen produced. This has been done by empirically finding the\nrelationship between the energy indicator A\/\nI, where A is\nabsorption and I is the absolute optical intensity at 557.7 nm,\nand the characteristic energy E0 of an assumed Maxwellian\nFigure 2. Scatterplot of the natural logarithm of the ratio of\nabsorption to the square root of optical intensity versus the\ninverse of Maxwellian characteristic energy of the precipitating\nparticles for the combined data sets of February 13, 1996, and\nNovember 9, 1998. The solid line shows the best fit of equation\n(13). The dashed and dotted lines show 1 and 2 standard\ndeviations, respectively, from the best fit.\n28,935KOSCH ET AL.: HIGH-RESOLUTION CHARACTERISTIC ENERGY MAPS\nenergy distribution. E0 is obtained by fitting the Maxwellian\nfunction to the energy spectra of the precipitating electrons,\nwhich has been obtained by inverting the electron density al-\ntitude profile measured by EISCAT. Once the relationship\nbetween E0 and A\/\nI is known, the imaging capabilities of\nIRIS and DASI are exploited to map E0 to the entire common\nfield of view. This has been done for two data sets (February\n13, 1996, and November 9, 1998) in order to improve the\nstatistics of the empirical fit as well as to demonstrate that the\ngood fit was not by chance. The energy maps open a new way\nof studying auroral processes, and we have shown the first\nsubstorm studied in terms of the spatial morphology of the\nenergy of the precipitating particles.\nAcknowledgments.
