INTRODUCTION\nFollowing the spectacular success in achieving Bose-\nEinstein condensation in trapped, dilute atomic gases in 1995\n@1\u20133#, there has been an explosion of experimental and the-\noretical activity on this newly accessible state of matter ~for\nrecent reviews focusing on different experimental and theo-\nretical aspects, see, for instance, Refs. @4\u20138#!. More recently,\nthere has been increasing interest and experimental activity\nalso in quantum-degenerate ultracold Fermi gases @9\u201314#, in\nparticular because of the possibility of observing a BCS type\ntransition in a dilute atomic gas @15,16#. Dilute mixtures of\nultracold gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms are also re-\nceiving increased attention, in particular because sympathetic\ncooling of the fermions by the bosons is an important means\nof their achieving quantum degeneracy @11\u201314#, and also\nbecause bosons can mediate an induced ~attractive! fermion-\nfermion interaction @17#. Moreover, mixtures of atomic 3He\nand 4He have become interesting in their own right after the\nrecent achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in meta-\nstable 4He @18,19#, as they could represent a bridge toward\nthe understanding of superfluidity in helium.\nCurrent analyses of dilute mixtures of ultracold atomic\nboson and fermion vapors are based on mean-field approxi-\nmations. They include, for example, the work on stability\nconsiderations for homogeneous systems by Viverit et al.\n@17#, and the calculation of density distributions and phase\nseparation of trapped mixtures by Nygaard and Mo\u0094lmer @20#.\nSome interesting effects have been studied by Bijlsma et al.\n@21#, where an effective modification of the fermion-fermion\nscattering length, mediated by boson-fermion scattering pro-\ncesses, was determined. Pu et al. have determined the pho-\nnon spectrum of the Bose condensate in a boson-fermion\nmixture at zero temperature @22#.\nMean-field approaches have proved to be extremely use-\nful in the theoretical and experimental study of Bose-\nEinstein condensed dilute atomic gases, and are likely to\nprove similarly useful for quantum-degenerate mixed boson-\nfermion systems. It is nevertheless desirable to consider ef-\nfects beyond mean field, and under what circumstances they\nare likely to be most relevant. For pure ~unpolarized! fer-\nmion @23\u201325# and pure boson @24\u201331# systems, expansions\nof the ground-state energy, in terms of the small parameters\nkFaFF and AnBaBB3 (kF is the Fermi wave number, nB the\nboson density, and aFF and aBB the fermion-fermion and\nboson-boson scattering lengths!, are well established. These\nexpansions go beyond mean-field approximations while still\ndepending only on the s-wave scattering lengths. Although\ndetermined for homogeneous systems, the use of beyond\nmean-field corrections arising from consideration of such ex-\npansions may be readily extended to the experimentally rel-\nevant case of inhomogeneous trapped gases by application of\nthe local density approximation. In general, the corrections\nbeyond mean field for the bosons are smaller than for the\nfermions, since the exponent of the small dimensionless pa-\nrameter n1\/3a (n is the density parameter and a the scattering\nlength! is 1 in the fermion case but 3\/2 in the boson case.\nImportant work on realistic treatments of strongly inter-\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A, VOLUME 65, 053607\n1050-2947\/2002\/65~5!\/053607~15!\/$20.00 \u00a92002 The American Physical Society65 053607-1\nacting 4He- 3He mixtures has been carried out by exploiting\ncorrelated basis function theory. In this framework the\nground-state energy density can be written as an integral\nover the interaction potential and the correlation functions\n@32,33#. A thorough variational theory of fermion-boson mix-\ntures has then been developed in terms of extended Jastrow-\nFeenberg wave functions that include both pair and triplet\ncorrelation functions. On the other hand, the application of\nfield theoretic and functional methods to mixtures of bosons\nand fermions has been so far almost unexplored. In the case\nof dilute fermions immersed in a Bose gas an expansion of\nthe ground-state energy in terms of the small parameters\nAaBB3 nB and nF \/nB , where nF is the fermion density, was\nperformed by Saam @34#. This was motivated by considering\nquantum-degenerate dilute gases as a model for the behavior\nof superfluid helium, where the assumption of nF \/nB as a\nsmall parameter is justified by the much greater natural oc-\ncurrence of bosonic 4He compared to that of the fermionic\n3He isotope. Considering a regime of low fermion concen-\ntration relative to the boson concentration, Saam neglected\ncorrections of the order of the Fermi wave number to the\nmean-field interaction, while treating the bosons in the Bo-\ngoliubov approximation; in this way, he obtained the correc-\ntions to mean field that are proportional to the bosonic gas\nparameter. Considering a regime of high fermion concentra-\ntion, we instead assume the bosons in the ideal gas approxi-\nmation ~thus neglecting the corrections proportional to the\nbosonic gas parameter!, while treating the boson-fermion in-\nteraction to second order, thus obtaining the corrections to\nmean field that are proportional to the Fermi wave number.\nWe will show in the following that in the case of comparable\nbosonic and fermionic densities, these latter corrections are\nlarger than those obtained by Saam. In particular, we develop\na systematic treatment of the boson-fermion interaction, by\ndetermining the renormalized boson-fermion T matrix to sec-\nond order in the boson-fermion scattering length. In this way\nwe compute the lowest order correction beyond mean field to\nthe ground-state energy density due to the boson-fermion gas\nparameter. This correction is obviously absent in Saam\u2019s\ntreatment, and it is of order 7\/3 in the overall power of the\ncombined bosonic and fermionic densities. On the other\nhand, the lowest Saam\u2019s correction due to the renormalized\nboson-boson interaction is of order 5\/2 in the overall power\nof the combined bosonic and fermionic densities. The cor-\nrection due to the renormalized boson-fermion interaction is\nthen the larger one, and thus the one of greatest relevance for\nthe description of dilute Bose-Fermi mixtures beyond mean\nfield, when both densities are of comparable magnitude, or\nthere are vastly more fermions than bosons. We can in prin-\nciple combine the effects of the renormalization of the\nboson-fermion and boson-boson couplings to compute all the\ncorrections to order 5\/2 ~which will include the ones com-\nputed by Saam by taking into account only the renormalized\nboson-boson interaction!. Work is in progress on the deter-\nmination of the higher-order corrections, and will be reported\nelsewhere.\nWe point out that our results are valid for any ratio of the\nfermionic and bosonic densities. Systems where there are\nvastly more bosons than fermions are certainly experimen-\ntally achievable in dilute atomic gases, and it can in fact be\nadvantageous to have an excess of bosons in order to en-\nhance sympathetic cooling @11#. However, there is in prin-\nciple no a priori reason to confine theoretical analyses to\nsuch systems. In fact, in recent experiments @13,14# the num-\nbers of fermions and bosons are comparable. Thus moti-\nvated, in the present paper, as already anticipated, we derive\na systematic perturbative expansion for the ground-state en-\nergy and other related relevant physical quantities for dilute\nBose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature and for arbitrary\nratios of the boson and fermion densities. In this way we\ndetermine the lowest-order correction to the mean field in the\ncase of weakly interacting bosons and spin-polarized fermi-\nons in terms of the Bose-Fermi gas parameter kFaBF , where\naBF is the boson-fermion s-wave scattering length. The\nground-state energy thus derived can then be implemented,\nin local density approximation, as the energy functional for\nthe study of the experimentally relevant case of trapped mix-\ntures, in complete analogy with the pure bosonic and pure\nfermionic cases.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we intro-\nduce the basic Hamiltonian for a system of interacting\nbosons and spin-polarized fermions, expressed in its grand-\ncanonical form after performing the Bogoliubov replace-\nment. In Sec. III we define the one-particle Green\u2019s functions\nneeded for a systematic field-theoretical analysis of the\nboson-boson and boson-fermion interactions, and we deter-\nmine the associated Feynman rules. In Sec. IV we implement\nthe perturbative expansion by introducing the boson-fermion\nself-energy and the renormalized boson-fermion T matrix in\nthe ladder approximation and by solving the corresponding\nBethe-Salpeter equation to second order in kFaBF . In Sec. V\nwe exploit the results obtained in the previous sections to\ncompute some relevant physical quantities. In particular, we\nprovide the expression for the ground-state energy density to\nsecond order in the gas parameter, the bosonic and fermionic\nchemical potentials, the compressibilities, and the induced\nfermion-fermion interaction. We then compare the results\nthus obtained with actual and foreseeable experimental situ-\nations to assess the relative importance of higher-order cor-\nrections with respect to the mean-field results. In Sec. VI\nconclusions are drawn and some possible future develop-\nments are discussed.\nII. SYSTEM\nA. Hamiltonian and ground-state energy\n1. Many-body Hamiltonian\nWe consider a homogeneous mixture of interacting\nbosons and fermions, imposing periodic boundary conditions\non a volume V. In complete generality there are thus boson-\nboson, boson-fermion, and fermion-fermion interactions to\nconsider. However, for spin-polarized fermions, there is no\ns-wave scattering contribution to the fermion-fermion inter-\naction @35#. The first nonvanishing contribution is due to\np-wave scattering, which can generally be neglected when\ncompared to the boson-boson and boson-fermion interactions\ndue to s-wave scattering. We thus take into account s-wave\nscattering between bosons, and between bosons and fermions\nonly.\nALBUS, GARDINER, ILLUMINATI, AND WILKENS PHYSICAL REVIEW A 65 053607\n053607-2\nIn second-quantized form, the Hamiltonian describing this\nsituation is\nH\u02c6 5T\u02c6 B1T\u02c6 F1U\u02c6 1V\u02c6 , ~1!\nwhere\nT\u02c6 B5\n\\2\n2mB\nE d3x\u0093F\u02c6 \u2020~x!\u0095\u0093F\u02c6 ~x!, ~2!\nT\u02c6 F5\n\\2\n2mF\nE d3x\u0093C\u02c6 \u2020~x!\u0095\u0093C\u02c6 ~x!, ~3!\nU\u02c6 5E E d3xd3x8F\u02c6 \u2020~x!C\u02c6 \u2020~x8!U~ ux2x8u!C\u02c6 ~x8!F\u02c6 ~x!,\n~4!\nV\u02c6 5\n1\n2E E d3xd3x8F\u02c6 \u2020~x!F\u02c6 \u2020~x8!V~ ux2x8u!F\u02c6 ~x8!F\u02c6 ~x!,\n~5!\nand where F\u02c6 (x) is a bosonic field operator, C\u02c6 (x) is a fermi-\nonic field operator, and mB and mF are the respective masses\nof the bosons and fermions.

In Fig. 5 the values for\nmixtures of 6Li and 7Li, and 40K and 87Rb, corresponding to\nreal experimental configurations currently under investiga-\ntion, are plotted, as well as that for a mixture of 3He and\n4He, also a likely candidate for future investigation in ultra-\ncold dilute gas experiments. The value for a hypothetical\nmixture of 3He and 1H is also shown, as it is almost exactly\nthe maximum possible. The function f (d) is always positive\nin the total range @21,1# of variations of d . Note that in the\nlimit mB \/mF\u2192\u2018 , one has d\u21921 and f (d)\u21920. Thus the\nsecond-order correction to the boson-fermion interaction en-\nergy and the total boson-boson interaction energy disappear.\nThis is because if the bosons are infinitely massive ~com-\npared to a fixed, finite fermion mass!, then it is impossible\nfor them to be scattered out of the condensate, and only the\nboson-fermion mean field interaction remains, since all the\nbosons can be treated as the ~condensate! mean field. In the\nopposite limit of mB \/mF\u21920, the situation is different, be-\ncause of the Pauli exclusion principle.\nIn Fig. 6 we compare the mean-field contributions ~a! and\nsecond-order correction ~b! to the energy functional for a\n6Li,7Li mixture, for a range of values of h . The plots corre-\nspond to a situation where the scattering lengths aBB\n50.2 nm, aBF52.7 nm and the fermion density nF55.1\n31010 cm23 are fixed, and compatible with the experiments\ndescribed in Ref. @14#, while the boson density is varied.\nNote that for any reasonable boson density, the boson gas\nparameter b is indeed very small compared to a .

The depletion is computed in a standard way by inte-\ngrating the boson propagator for the noncondensed particles\nGB8 (pm) over the four-momentum.

The situation\nwill be different to next order in aBF , as in this case the total\ndiagonal bosonic self-energy will depend on the four-\nmomentum. However, the calculation of SB(pm) to second\norder in the boson-fermion scattering length at nonzero four-\nmomentum involves the evaluation of integrals that cannot\nbe carried out analytically in a straightforward way. In con-\nclusion, in the present situation, we will consider the deple-\ntion due to the bosons only, which is well known @24,25#:\nnB2n05\n8\n3A\nnBaB\n3\np\nnB . ~81!\nWe now turn to a discussion of the fermion-fermion inter-\naction induced by the presence of the bosons.

Fermi gas, although clearly with different coeffi-\ncients. There is thus, as expected, an induced fermion-\nfermion interaction, which can now be computed by\nexploiting the expressions that we have derived for both the\nbosonic and the fermionic chemical potentials. This will\nyield a modification of the known induced fermion-fermion\ninteraction previously discussed in the mean-field approxi-\nmation @17#.

This is the simplest diagram by which two fermi-\nons can interact via the exchange of a bosonic excitation.\nThe density-density response function x(qm) is indepen-\ndent of aBF to first order. This can be easily verified follow-\ning the same line of reasoning described previously in the\nanalysis of the bosonic propagator.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\nIn summary, we have determined ground-state properties\nof a homogeneous system of bosons mixed with spin-\npolarized fermions at zero temperature. We have calculated\nthe boson-fermion T matrix and the corresponding self-\nenergies. We have then shown how to incorporate the effects\nFIG. 8.

PHYSICAL REVIEW A 65 053607\n053607-11\nof the boson-boson interaction and derived some relevant\nphysical quantities of the system, in particular the ground-\nstate energy. The importance of the corrections beyond mean\nfield has been discussed in several different instances of ex-\nperimental interest. For mixtures of bosonic and fermionic\nhelium we have shown that the terms beyond mean field may\nyield significant corrections ~up to 50% of the mean-field\nresult!. We have provided partial results also on two very\nsignificant physical quantities, namely, the Bose condensate\nfraction and the induced fermion-fermion interaction. To pro-\nvide more quantitative predictions for these quantities, as\nwell as for the BCS transition temperature, we will need to\ncompute in detail the corrections to second order in the\nboson-fermion scattering length. Results of this analysis,\nwhich go beyond the scope of the present paper, will appear\nin a forthcoming work, together with a detailed numerical\nanalysis of the conditions for stability and for phase separa-\ntion. Collective modes, effective fermion mass, and excita-\ntion spectra fully evaluated to second order in the boson-\nfermion scattering length will be discussed as well.\nExtensions of the formalism developed in this paper can\nbe made in different directions. First, one can consider un-\npolarized spin-1\/2 fermions. Calculations are very similar to\nthe present situation with the main difference that one has to\ninclude the effects of the direct interactions of fermions with\ndifferent spins. This would correspond to having a third scat-\ntering length aFF . As in the previous case, we expect that in\nthe two-particle scattering approximation the energy contri-\nbution for a pure fermion system of spin-1\/2 fermions is\nsimply added to Eq. ~70! in this case ~and of course, the\nFermi momentum has to be modified appropriately!.\nThe formalism can also be extended to consider finite\ntemperature. As in the case of pure bosons we expect con-\nsiderable difficulties near the critical temperature. Well be-\nlow that temperature, however, we expect no major compli-\ncations and the calculations will be similar to the present\ncase, except that boson loops will have to be taken into ac-\ncount and frequency integrals will have to be replaced by\nMatsubara frequency sums.\nA very important and natural possible extension is the\ninvestigation of inhomogeneous, e.g., harmonically trapped,\nsystems. This can be done by augmenting the existing mean-\nfield calculations via the correlation terms in local density\napproximation. To this end, the results obtained in the\npresent work are needed. The method and the full numerical\nprocedure will be described in a forthcoming paper.\nFinally, higher-order corrections may be computed in\nprinciple. These higher-order terms will also involve the\nbosonic gas parameter as well as three-particle correlations,\nand thus expansions like Eq. ~70! will not reduce to sums of\nterms, where only one scattering length appears at a time, but\nwill include also terms that contain products of powers of\nboth scattering lengths. To even higher orders nonuniversal\nproperties like the parameters describing the shape of the\ninteraction potentials will become important and will have to\nbe taken properly into account, as has been recently done in\nthe pure bosonic case @31,47#.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Gordon Baym for seminal comments\non an earlier draft of the present work.

The derivation\nis then the same, apart from some sign factors.\n@44# The proof of the validity of the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem can\nbe adopted literally from the pure boson case, since it is based\non how to replace condensate lines by noncondensate propa-\ngators; a procedure which is unchanged in the present situa-\ntion.\n@45# This could possibly be realized by a Feschbach resonance,\nwith the effective boson-boson scattering length tuned down to\nnearly zero.
