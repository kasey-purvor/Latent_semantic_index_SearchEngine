Introduction \nAir infiltration and inter-zonal air movement have \nbeen recognised as a major factor for determining \nenergy efficiency, indoor air quality and \ncondensation formation risk in buildings. Existing \nmethods (tracer gas techniques, computer modelling \nand pressure tests) have limitations (Sanders, 1982; \nEssah et al., 2006) for determining and predicting \nairflows in buildings. The most established \ntechniques uses tracer gas and in some instances \ncomputer simulations (simple cases) (Mundt, 1996). \n \nThe appropriate experimental method of \ndetermining air movement and ventilation rates in \nhouses have been tracer gas techniques (Sanders, \n1982). It provides the only direct measure of total \nflow rates (including infiltration) of outdoor air to \nbuildings under actual living conditions (Dietz and \nCote, 1982). However, this technique is becoming \nmore and more difficult to sustain, since such \ntechniques uses tubes, pumps, filters and light-\nscattering devices (Koziel et al. 1999) all of which \nmakes the sampling equipment: expensive, bulky to  \n \ncarry around, and requiring lengthy sampling periods. \nAlso, some of the gases used have adverse effects on \nthe climate, such as ozone depletion (Essah, 2009). \nConsequently, there have been growing demands for \nsimple, cost-effective sampling and analytical methods, \ncapable of achieving very low detection limits in near \nreal-time (Koziel et al. 1999). \n1.1 Importance of this Research \nOne of the issues that were considered during the Kyoto \nProtocol was the impending ban of all fluorine gases, \none of which is currently used as a tracer gas (i.e. \nSulphur hexafluoride-SF6) was considered. This raised \nconcerns for a possible alternative, in case tracer gas \ntechniques are eventually abolished (Essah, 2009). It is \ntherefore essential that alternative techniques are \nextensively researched.  \n \nThe introduction and current use of passive samplers \nshows that such devices have the potential to be \npossible alternative or replacement for tracer gas \ntechniques, however, this has to be developed. Passive \nsamplers are used to assess the quality of various \nenvironmental components (air, water, soil). Probably \nAbstract \nTracer gas techniques have been the most appropriate experimental method of determining airflows and \nventilation rates in houses, however, current trends to reduce greenhouse gas effects have prompted the need for \nalternative techniques, such as passive sampling. In this research Passive sampling techniques have the potential \nto fulfil these requirements by using solutions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and solid phase \nmicroextraction (SPME) fibres. Passive sampling techniques have been calibrated against tracer gas decay \ntechniques and measurements from a standard orifice plate. Two constant sources of volatile organic compounds \nwere diffused into two sections of a humidity chamber and sampled using SPME fibres. From a total of four \nSPME fibres (two in each section), reproducible results were obtained. Emission rates and air movement from \none section to the other were predicted using developed algorithms. Comparison of the SPME fibre technique, to \nthat of the tracer gas technique and measurements from an orifice plate showed similar results, with good \nprecision and accuracy. With these fibres, infiltration rates can be measured over grab samples in a time \nweighted averaged period lasting from 10 minutes up to several days. \n \nKeywords: Passive Samplers, Solid Phase Microextraction fibre, tracer gas techniques airflow and air \ninfiltration. \n \n \nPrinciples and calibration of solid phase microextraction fibre (passive sampler) for \nmeasurements of airflow and air infiltration in domestic houses \n \nEmmanuel A Essah \nEnergy Group, School of Construction Management and Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, RG6 6AW, \nUK \nChris H Sanders \nCentre for Research on Indoor Climate and Health School of Built & Natural Environment Glasgow Caledonian \nUniversity, Glasgow, United Kingdom, G4 0BA \n 2 \nTable 1.

None of these measurements involved \nmonitoring the mass transport (such as water \nvapour, contaminants, etc) from one volume to the \nother.  \n \nIn this paper, the concept and potential of a passive \nsampler to be used in monitoring air infiltration and \ninter-zonal air movement in houses have been \ninvestigated using a Solid-Phase Microextraction \n(SPME) fibre. The procedures of using the SPME \nFibre have been demonstrated. In addition, a \ncomparison is made with standard techniques (i.e. \ntracer gas techniques and flow rates through orifice \nplates) to calibrate and validate measurements of the \nfibre for air movements in houses.  \n2. General Theory of Passive Samplers \nThe theory of passive samplers and hence SPME \nfibres are well documented by previous researchers \nin environmental and chemical analyses (Khaled \nand Pawliszyn, 2000; Martos and Pawliszyn, 1999). \nHowever, its use in houses to monitor air movement \nhas been documented in only a few instances.  \nOne of such instance involved Perfluorocarbon \nTracers (PFT) (Dietz and Cote, 1982) to analyse \nventilation rates in one zone or volume but not for \ninter-zonal air movement determinations.  \n \n \nBy definition, passive sampling is a technique based on \nfree flow (according to the Fick\u2019s first law of diffusion) \nof tracer molecules from the source to a collecting \nmedium due to the difference in chemical potential. The \ndevice use is usually based on diffusion through a well-\ndefined diffusion barrier or permeation through a \nmembrane. This technique is particularly suited to \ndetermine time-weighted averages (TWA) of \nconcentrations (Zabiegala et al. 2002; Namie\u015bnik et al. \n2005) as well as transitory (grab) concentration levels \nin an environment.  \n2.1 Existing Applications \nPassive samplers have been used for numerous \napplications since its introduction in 1927 (G\u00f3recki and \nNamie\u015bnik, 2002). The sampling mode is normally \nselected based on the goals of the actual measurements \n(Zabiegala et al. 2002). Most of its application are \nsummarised in Table 1. The choice of an ideal sampler \nis decided depending on the sampling matrix (i.e. gas, \nliquid or solid). Nevertheless, it is by no means limited \nto these sampling categories. \n2.2 Principles and Choice of a Passive Sampler \nThe net flow of analyte (tracer) molecules from a \nmedium to the sampler continues till equilibrium is \nestablished in the sampling system or until the sampling \nsession is terminated by the user (G\u00f3recki and \nNamie\u015bnik, 2002). In these two approaches, two main \nconditions must be met:  \n\uf0b7 Firstly, the sampler should act as a zero sink. That \nis, it should not allow the trapped molecules to be \nreleased even if the concentration of the analyte \naround the sampler decreases to zero (G\u00f3recki and \nNamie\u015bnik, 2002), or in other terms the mass \n \n 3 \nTable 2.

Namie\u015bnik et al. (2005) in their \nstudies cited more than ten types, some of which are \nlisted below: \n\uf0be Liquid passive sampler (LIPS) \n\uf0be Personal aldehydes and ketones sampler \n(PAKS) \n\uf0be Passive diffusion bag samplers (PDMS) \n\uf0be Passive integrative mercury sampler \n(PIMS) \n\uf0be Passive air samplers (PAS) \n\uf0be Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibre  \nOther notable samplers cited on the health and \nsafety site (http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk) are:  \n\uf0be Charcoal\/solvent desorption tubes \n\uf0be Thermal desorption tubes (for instance, \nTenax tubes). \nIn this research, the SPME fibre was the most \nappropriate technique (for reasons further discussed in \nsection 3). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were \nconsidered as possible tracer molecules. This is because \nmost applications of VOCs contribute significantly to \ncompounds in air as it is used in paints, varnishes \namongst others. These compounds which are available, \nsuitable and compatible for these applications are \nnormally present in air at levels above 0.1\u03bcg\/l (Khaled \nand Pawliszyn, 2000). \n \nTwo of the well known VOCs selected were: \na) Toluene C7H8  \nb) Xylene C8H10 {ortho(o)\n_\n, meta(m)\n_\n, para(p)\n_ \nisomers}.  \nToluene: Toluene, also known as methylbenzene or \nphenylmethane, is a clear, water-insoluble liquid with \nthe typical smell of paint thinners. It occurs naturally at \nlow levels in crude oil, usually produced in the \nprocesses of making gasoline via a catalytic reformer. It \nis a common solvent, able to dissolve paints, paint \nthinners, silicone sealants, many chemical reactants, \nrubber, printing ink, adhesives, lacquers, leather \ntanners, and disinfectants (Atkins, 1989; \nwww.smarterhomes.org.nz). \nXylene: The term xylene refers to a mixture of three \nbenzene derivatives which is also used as a solvent in \nthe printing, rubber, and leather industries. Xylene is a \ncolorless, sweet-smelling liquid (Atkins, 1989; \nwww.smarterhomes.org.nz). It has three isomers; \northo(o)\n_\n, meta(m)\n_\n, para(p)\n_ \nisomers \n \nAfter a sensitivity analysis (Section 4.1) ortho-xylene \nwas selected as the most suitable isomer. Appropriate \nSPME fibres were also selected based on fibre \nsensitivity (Table 2).  \n2.3 Properties of Fibre Coating \nPolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): is the most widely used \nsilicon-based organic polymer, and is particularly \nknown for its unusual rheological (or flow) properties. \nIts applications range from contact lenses and medical \ndevices. PDMS is optically clear, and is generally \nconsidered to be inert, non-toxic and non-flammable \n(www.scribd.com). \n 4 \n                          \nFigure 1.

Diagram illustrating a plunged SPME showing its fibre \nDivinylbenzene (DVB): consists of a benzene ring \nbonded to two vinyl groups. It is related to styrene \n(vinylbenzene) by the addition of a second vinyl \ngroup. Divinylbenzene is a 2:1 mixture of m- and p- \ndivinylbenzene, containing also the corresponding \nethylvinylbenzene isomers (Essah, 2009). \n \nCarboxen (CAR): it is a carbon molecular \ncompound with a relatively low affinity for water \n(Essah, 2009; http:\/\/www.sisweb.com)  \n \nThe chemical composition of Carboxen and \npolydimethylsiloxane (i.e. CAR\/PDMS) is ideal for \ngaseous\/volatile analytes which has a high retention \nfor tracer analysis. Divinylbenzene\/Carboxen \n(DVB\/CAR) on polydimethylsiloxane coating is \nsuitable for sampling a broad range of analyte (with \ncarbon chains from C3-C20). These selected SPME \nfibres can be used to analyse both VOCs, however, \ntheir sensitivities are different (Table2) hence \n different sampling rates for the different compounds \n(SPME newsletter, 1999\/2000).  \n3. Passive Sampling: the solid phase \nmicroextraction (SPME) fibre \nSPME fibres are designed and manufactured to use a \nre-useable syringe-like fibre coated with a liquid \n(polymer), a solid (sorbent) or a combination of both \n(Supelco, Bulletin 929). When the concentrations of \ntracer compounds in an environment are too low to be \nmeasured by conventional means, the SPME fibre is \ncapable to detect these low concentrations (for instance \nin order of parts per billion - ppb). It also allows for \ndirect transfer into a standard gas chromatography \n(GC), where the results are analysed. Figure 1 \nillustrates a typical SPME fibre. The stainless steel \ncasing (Figure 2) was designed and manufactured for \nfield measurements, to withstand environmental \nconditions. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5 \nA \nConcentration  \ngradient when \nCSorbent = 0 \nSorbent (fibre) \nCSorbent \nCFACE \nZ \nFigure 3.

SPME diffusive fibre in the retracted mode for TWA Sampling \n \nThe SPME fibre is occasionally used by exposing \nthe fibre to the sample matrix, until equilibrium is \nreached (Koziel et al., 1999). The amount of analyte \nabsorbed onto the fibre is proportional to the \nconcentrations in the matrix. It can be used to \nsample very low concentrations as well as high \nconcentrations (Martos and Pawliszyn, 1999). In \naddition, it is also used for TWAs. This is achieved \nby retracting the coated fibre a known distance into \nits needle housing. The amount of analytes \naccumulated gives the measurement of the average \nconcentration to which the device was exposed \n(Martos and Pawliszyn, 1999). Depending on the \napproach used, the equilibrium time varies from \nminutes to days (Koziel et al., 1999). \n \nThe time weighted average concentrations of \nseveral grab sampled analytes, over a series of time \nintervals are computed using Equation 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nn\nnn\ntttt\ntCtCtCtC\nnt\nC\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n...\n...\n321\n332211\n          (2) \n \nWhere Ct is the concentration of the time-weighted \naverages, C1 is the analyte concentration observed at \ntime t1, until time tn. \n \nAlternatively, it is obtained with only one sampler, \nwhere t1= tn (Equation 2).In this, the sampler absorbs \nthe analyte in direct proportion to the bulk analyte \nconcentration for a specific sampling period (Martos \nand Pawliszyn, 1999).This approach can be achieved as \nfollows:  \n\uf0b7 Figure 3 illustrates the concentration gradient of an \nanalyte produced between the opening of the needle \nand the position of the fibre coating. The sampler \nwhich consists of a sorbent is positioned at a \ndistance \u201cZ\u201d from the opening, of a fixed surface \narea, \u201cA\u201d.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6 \n\uf0b7 By Fick\u2019s law of diffusion, it is possible to \ndetermine the amount of analyte that is loaded \nonto the fibre (Khaled and Pawliszyn, 2000; \nMartos and Pawliszyn, 1999).  \n \nAssumptions \nTo accomplish using the fibre effectively, three \nbasic assumptions were considered; \n\uf076 The analyte concentration in the bulk gas \nsystem, CBULK, must be equal to the analyte \nconcentration at the face of the sampling device, \nCF (Figure 4). \n\uf076 The sampling device must respond in \nproportion to the changing analyte \nconcentration at the face of the device. \n\uf076 The fibre should act as a \u201czero sink\u201d for the \ntarget analytes. \n \nSince the SPME diffusive fibre obeys Fick\u2019s first \nlaw, Equations 1 is applicable. Studies conducted by \nMartos and Pawliszyn (1999) and Khaled and \nPawliszyn (2000) developed relations for \nmonitoring a single volume. These have been used \nextensively for TWA sampling.  \n \nIn their key findings, they concluded that, the mass \nload of the substance accumulated on the sampler \n(M) is a function of time (t), the effective cross \nsectional area open to diffusion (A), and the flux (J). \nA simplified expression identifies M\/SRt to be an \naverage sampling rate, which is directly \nproportional to the average bulk tracer \nconcentration (CF) over time from t1 to t2 (with t1 = \n0 and CS= 0). \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\ntS\nM\nC\nR\nF                                                            (3) \nThis indicates that the mass loading of analyte onto \nthe diffusive sampler (M\/t) is dependent on the \nsampling rate of the device (SR) which is directly \nproportional to the bulk analyte concentration (i.e. \nCF = CB). For a constant analyte concentration, SR \ncan be empirically determined using Equation 4. \n\uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\ntC\nM\nS\nB\nR                                                            (4) \nOnce SR is determined, it can be used to quantify \nunknown concentration by simply measuring the \namount of analyte loaded (M), on the fibre for a \ngiven sampling time t. (Khaled and Pawliszyn, \n2000; Martos and Pawliszyn, 1999). One of the \nmain advantages of using SPME fibres as TWA \nsamplers is that, the path length, Z, as illustrated in \nFigure 4 can be increased or decreased. This \naccommodates higher concentrations or longer \nsampling times when increased, or lower concentrations \nor shorter sampling times when decreased.  \n \nThe above theory is applicable for sampling from a \nsingle volume. As a result during this research, further \nalgorithms were developed to ensure good \nunderstanding of inter-zonal air movement (section \n4.3).  \n3.1 Potential for using SPME fibres (why and how) \nIn recent times the use of SPME fibre technique have \nbecome predominant in monitoring indoor air pollution \nand its mass transport because they are simple in design \nand use, and are relatively cheap. They do not require \nany power supply and they are able to simultaneously \ndetect the presence of different compounds in their \nvapour form. SPME fibre technique is used in many \napplications where very sensitive yet simple air \nsampling and analysis are required. This is because it is \neasy to monitor and has the potential of replacing \nlabour and cost intensive methods (such as tracer gas \ntechniques) which are currently used by regulatory \nagencies, research or academic institutions, and contract \nlaboratories (Namie\u015bnik, 2001).  \n \nThe fibre can be re-used 50-100 times, and disposed of \nwhen the fibre is no longer usable. (Supelco, Bulletin \n929). In this research, the fibres have been re-used at \nleast 50 times. \n4. Measurements and calibration  \n4.1 Sensitivity analysis of the isomers of xylene- \nusing head space \nA series of sensitivity analyses to select one suitable \nisomer of xylene was performed. Head space of the \npure liquids were taken and plunged into the GC. \nRetention times (RT) of ortho-, meta-, para- xylene \nobtained from the GC (Figure 5) are summarised in \nTable 3.

The bag was half filled (2.5L) with air \nafter which 5\u03bcl of the required VOC was injected into \nthe bag through the septum. It was then filled by air. \nThis method (i.e. in two stages), was adapted to ensure \ngood mixer of the VOC. Calculations and dilutions \nwere made after equilibrium was attained. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCalculations and method of diluting concentrations \nRecommendations by Occupational Safety and \nHealth (OSHA) and National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) specify \nthat in any given workplace, the limit of exposure to \nconcentrations levels of VOCs for a maximum of 15 \nminutes must not exceed 50 ppm or 191mgm\n-3 \n(McCammon, 1995). These levels are significantly \nlower than the 332 mg\/m\n3\n recommended by WHO \n(WHO, 2007).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor simplification, assuming that 5mg (liquid) \uf0bb 5\u03bcl \n(liquid), Essah (2009) assumed that every 5 mg of the \nliquid solution was the maximum possible \nconcentration that is in a 5 litre container (in this case \nthe bag). \n \nHence, if 5mg of liquid toluene or o-xylene was \ninjected separately into the 5 L bag, the concentration \ngenerated in the bag in mg\/m\n3\n was obtained using \nEquation 5.

This ensured that \nthe calibration values were within the accepted \nexposure limits. The concentration developed for \ncalibration could determine levels of at least 1.7 ppb, \nlower than the safe concentrations (Table 4). \nConcepts of vapour absorption \nEach VOC has a maximum equilibrium concentration \nwhich was reached in the tedlar bag (Essah, 2009). This \nconcept was verified, by monitoring the concentration \nlevels at constant intervals. It was observed that once \nsaturation was attained, the peak values were constant \nall through the experiments. \n  \n  \nAnalysis and results \nTwo sets of SPME fibres were used to sample head \nspace from each vial for 10mins, (5mins less the \nrecommended exposure limit). Using the GC, the \nsampled analytes were analysed as tabulated in \nTables 5 and 6 \n \nData obtained after sampling toluene (C7H8) from \nthe vials \nAt this stage the vials contained only toluene. Two \nfibres of each type were used to reduce errors and \nensure accuracy. Comparing both fibres there is a \nvery good correlation (R\n2\n), and the theory of the \nmanufacturer is confirmed, that is DVB\/CAR is less \nsensitive to toluene compared to CAR\/PDMS  \n \n(Table 5). Repeated results obtained from the GC \nanalysis were identical, within \u00b1 3% of each other. \nData obtained after sampling o-xylene (C8H10) from \nthe vials \nIn this analysis the vials used contained only o-xylene, \na very good correlation was obtained from the \ncalibration curves. Table 6 illustrates the sensitivity of \neach SPME fibre to o-xylene. As above, two fibres \nwere used to reduce errors and ensure accuracy. This \nshows that the SPME fibre is consistent in its \nmeasurements as the sampled results obtained from the \nGC analysis varied within \u00b1 3% of each other \n \n 9 \nTable 5.

This calibration was \nperformed using two established techniques (i.e. \ntracer gas techniques and orifice plate \nmeasurements). The key findings are as follows: \n\uf0b7 The experiments using the same and\/or \ndifferent SPME fibres were reproducible \nwithin experimental precision, similar results \nto within \u00b1 3%. \n\uf0b7 The two scenarios employed in the humidity \nchamber illustrates that the fibre is most \neffective within a well mixed environment. \n\uf0b7 Comparison of the SPME fibre technique \nwith the other two within a well mixed \nenvironment, illustrates a deviation between \n3%-7%.  \n\uf0b7 This study confirms the use of SPME fibres \nas a potential technique to monitor air \nmovement from one volume to the other.  \n \nThis research paper has demonstrated how to extend \nthe potential of existing passive sampling \ntechniques for measuring air movements between \ntwo volumes. It shows that SPME fibres can be \nused as an alternative to tracer gas techniques but \nunlike the latter, which provides several results, \nTWAs of the SPME fibre gives only one value, unless \nseveral fibres are used simultaneously. This knowledge \nis essential for further development of on-going \nresearch work. \n \nAcknowledgement  \nThe work described in this paper was sponsored by \nMonier Technical Centre, Ltd, UK in collaboration with \nthe RICH Centre of Glasgow Caledonian University, \nGlasgow. \n \nReferences \nAtkins, P.W., 1989.
