INTRODUCTION\nAtoms and ions interacting with intense infrared laser\npulses emit high-order harmonics of the driving field in the\nform of coherent attosecond pulses @1\u20136#. This process is\nreadily understood in terms of the semiclassical recollision,\nor \u2018\u2018Simpleman\u2019s model,\u2019\u2019 whereby electrons are detached\nfrom their parent atom or ion by quasistatic tunneling ioniza-\ntion, oscillate in the field, and return to the core where they\nradiatively recombine @7\u201311#. A fully quantum version of\nthis model has formed the basis of a vast number of theoret-\nical investigations of high-order-harmonic generation @10\u2013\n12#, and has been used successfully to analyze experiment\n~see, e.g., Ref. @13#!. This theory relies on the strong-field\napproximation ~SFA!, which assumes that the interaction of\nthe detached electron with the field is much stronger than its\ninteraction with the core so that the latter can be neglected.\nIn addition to explaining high-order-harmonic generation,\nthe model also forms the basis of our present understanding\nof other processes occurring in low-frequency laser fields,\nsuch as high-order above threshold ionization ~ATI! and\nrecollision-induced multiple ionization.\nOnce detached, the electron is accelerated by both the\nelectric-field and magnetic-field components of the incident\nbeam. The magnetic-field component tends to deflect the tra-\njectory towards the direction of propagation of the beam,\nwith the result that the electron never returns to the nucleus if\ndetached with zero velocity. The drift in the propagation di-\nrection imparted by the Lorentz force is largely offset by the\nwidth of the returning wave packet, and is therefore negli-\ngible at the intensities and wavelengths normally used in\nexperiments on high-order-harmonic generation ~typically\n1014\u20131015 W cm22 in the visible or near infrared!. In these\nconditions, the Lorentz force does not need to be taken into\naccount and the coupling of the electron with the incident\nfield is accurately described within the dipole approximation.\nHowever, at much higher intensities the drift is no longer\nnegligible and the dipole approximation ceases to be valid.\nMoreover, the electron\u2019s dynamics becomes relativistic at\nvery high intensities. ~At the Ti:sapphire wavelength, 800\nnm, the ratio of the nonrelativistic ponderomotive energy of\nthe electron to its rest energy exceeds unity for an intensity\nof 8.531018 W cm22.!\nRecent theoretical investigations of atomic stabilization in\nthe high-frequency stabilization regime @14\u201318# and of pho-\nton emission by ions interacting with intense near-infrared\nlaser pulses @19\u201324# have established the existence of a\n\u2018\u2018nondipole nonrelativistic\u2019\u2019 dynamical regime, in which the\neffect of the magnetic-field component of the laser is too\nlarge for the dipole approximation to be appropriate but not\nso large that a relativistic description is necessary. At the\nTi:sapphire wavelength, the dipole approximation is ex-\npected to remain valid up to intensities of about 531016\u20131\n31017 W cm22 ~depending on the system, as will be seen\nbelow!. Due to the magnetic drift, the probability that the\nelectron recombines with the core is non-negligible only if\nthe electron is initially detached with a nonzero velocity in\nthe direction opposite to the propagation direction of the in-\ncident beam. However, the detachment probability falls off\nrapidly if this initial velocity departs from zero @25,26#. The\nconsequence is that the harmonic generation is weaker and\nvaries differently as a function of the frequency of the emit-\nted photon than would be the case in the absence of the\nLorentz force.\nThe dipole approximation has been assumed in nearly all\nthe theoretical work to date on high-order-harmonic genera-\ntion in low-frequency fields. Only a few fully quantum cal-\nculations, all based on the strong-field approximation, have\naddressed the role of the magnetic drift in this context. Ex-\npressions for the dipole moment of an atom or ion in the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 66, 063411 ~2002!\n1050-2947\/2002\/66~6!\/063411~13!\/$20.00 \u00a92002 The American Physical Society66 063411-1\nnondipole nonrelativistic regime have been developed by\nWalser et al. @21# and, in another form, by us @22,27#, and\napplied to emission driven by ultrashort pulses. A relativistic\nformulation of harmonic generation in stationary fields,\nbased on the Klein-Gordon equation, has also been given by\nMilos\u02c7evic\u00b4, Hu, and Becker @20,24#.\nIn the present paper, we give a detailed account of the\nnondipole SFA sketched in Ref. @22# and relate it to the\ntheory of Walser et al. @21#. We also assess the importance of\nthe relativistic effects neglected in our approach by compar-\ning with results obtained by Milos\u02c7evic\u00b4, Hu, and Becker @20#.\nWe consider, in particular, the emission of photons by iso-\nlated Li21, Be31, and Ne61 ions exposed to strong near-\ninfrared pulses. We do not study emission from neutrals, as\nonly multicharged ions can withstand the intensities at which\nthe magnetic drift becomes significant without ionizing im-\nmediately. The importance of the nondipole effects is inves-\ntigated by comparing the nondipole nonrelativistic photon\nemission spectra with dipole spectra for long pulses ~repre-\nsented by stationary fields! as well as for few-cycle pulses.\nThe numerical results are interpreted with the help of the\nrecollision model, generalized to the nondipole case. The tra-\njectories we consider are real and obey the classical equa-\ntions of motion. This approach complements the description\nof the electron\u2019s dynamics in terms of complex trajectories\ndiscussed in Ref. @20#; the two approaches lead to essentially\nthe same physical picture. Finally, we illustrate how a sec-\nond, weak laser pulse can be used to compensate for the\nmagnetic drift of the electron. In particular, we show that the\nrecombination probability of selected electron trajectories\ncan be enhanced by several orders of magnitude in this way,\nthereby leading to photon emission in the form of a single\nattosecond x-ray pulse. Unless otherwise indicated, atomic\nunits are used throughout the paper.\nII. THEORETICAL APPROACH\nA. Nondipole nonrelativistic approximation\nWe assume that the vector potential describing the laser\nfield can be written as\nA~h!5e\u02c6~E\/v! f ~h!sin~h!, ~1!\nwith h5v(t2k\u02c6\u0095r\/c). The field has a carrier wavelength l\n52pc\/v , field strength E, is linearly polarized with polar-\nization vector e\u02c6, and propagates in the direction k\u02c6 . The func-\ntion f (h) describes the temporal profile of the pulse; f (h)\n[1 for a stationary field.\nThe influence of the magnetic-field component of the la-\nser on the electron dynamics can be accounted for in the\nlong-wavelength and nonrelativistic regime considered here\nby expanding the vector potential to first order in 1\/c .

The potential V(r) de-\nscribes the interaction of the electron with the ionic core.\nThere are two nondipole terms in the Hamiltonian: the first\none, in \u0093\u0095E(vt), gives rise to electric quadrupole and mag-\nnetic dipole transitions. The second one, in A(vt)\u0095E(vt),\ncontributes to the drift in the propagation direction induced\nby the magnetic-field component of the incident beam and\nhas a large influence on the emission of photons by ions at\nhigh laser intensities.\nAt low frequencies, it is appropriate to transform the time-\ndependent Schro\u00a8dinger equation to the length gauge, with the\nresult\ni\n]\n]t\nCL~r,t !5S 2 12 \u201e21Fr2 ic ~k\u02c6\u0095r!\u0093G\n\u0095E~vt !1V~r !

By introducing the\nretarded Green\u2019s function associated with the Hamiltonian of\nEq. ~4!, the wave function CL(r,t) can be obtained as the\nsolution of a time-dependent Lippmann-Schwinger equation.\nIn the SFA approach of Lewenstein and co-workers @1,10#,\nthis Green\u2019s function is replaced by the Volkov Green\u2019s func-\ntion associated with the Hamiltonian that describes a free\nelectron in the laser field, GV\n(1)(r,t;r8,t8). To account for the\nmagnetic-field component of the laser pulse at high intensi-\nties, we employ the nondipole Volkov Green\u2019s function dis-\ncussed in the Appendix.

A trajectory re-\nturning to the core leads to photon emission via recombina-\ntion, with the energy of the emitted photon being the sum of\nthe ionization potential and the kinetic energy of the electron\nat the time of recombination. Working within the dipole ap-\nproximation, Lewenstein and co-workers @10# have shown\nthat there is a one-to-one correspondence between the clas-\nsical trajectories of the recollision model and the saddle\ntimes obtained from Eq. ~27!. Such a correspondence also\nexists in our nondipole approach. In particular, it is straight-\nforward to show that a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe electron to return to the origin at time t is that t0 is any of\nthe saddle times td defined by Eq. ~19! and that v0\n5pk(ps ,td)k\u02c6 , where pk(ps ,td) is defined by Eq. ~21!. In the\nclassical model, pk(ps ,td) is thus the velocity in the pulse\npropagation direction that the electron must have at the time\nof detachment, td , in order to return to the nucleus at the\ntime of recombination, t. This initial velocity compensates\nexactly the displacement imparted by the magnetic-field\ncomponent of the pulse on the free electron in the field @21#.\nHow upk(ps ,td)u varies with t2td is shown in Fig. 1, for\na stationary field of 800 nm wavelength and 1.8\n31017 W cm22 intensity. Results are given for trajectories\nstarting at equally spaced values of td . Few or no trajectories\ncome back to the origin in certain time intervals, hence the\ngaps in the data.

Nondipole effects in photon emission\nDipole and nondipole nonrelativistic spectra are compared\nin Figs. 2 and 3 for photon emission by multiply charged\nions driven by a stationary 800-nm laser field. The modulus\nsquared of the Fourier transform of the dipole acceleration is\nplotted against the effective harmonic order, V\/v . The Fou-\nrier transform of the dipole acceleration is defined as\na~V!5\n1\n~2p!1\/2\nE\nT\nT12p\/v\ndt exp~2iVt !d\u00a8 ~ t !, ~42!\nwhere T is chosen large enough so as to include the long\ntrajectories that contribute to the dipole moment. We use the\nnotation ae(V)5e\u02c6\u0095a(V) and ak(V)5k\u02c6\u0095a(V) for the com-\nponents of the acceleration.\nThe gradual breakdown of the dipole approximation with\nincreasing intensity is illustrated in Fig. 2 for emission by a\nNe61 ion (Ip5207.3 eV). Going from 0.5 to 4\n31017 W cm22, the influence of the magnetic-field compo-\nnent first manifests itself as a reduction in photon emission\npolarized along e\u02c6 as compared to the dipole approximation,\nthen to a \u2018\u2018bending over\u2019\u2019 of the plateaus, and finally to a\nmarked suppression of emission at both ends of the spectrum\nand the disappearance of the intermediate cutoffs which\nseparate the plateaus in the dipole approximation. A small\nshift in the position of the cutoffs is also noticeable.\nNondipole spectra for emission polarized parallel to the\ndirection of propagation of the incident field are also shown\nin Fig. 2. Emission of photons polarized in this direction is\nforbidden in the dipole approximation. Compared to emis-\nsion polarized along e\u02c6 , emission polarized along the propa-\nFIG. 2.

PHYSICAL REVIEW A 66, 063411 ~2002!\n063411-6\ngation direction is weaker, but the spectra are otherwise simi-\nlar in most respects. The dip visible in the low-energy part of\nFigs. 2~a! and 2~b! also occurs when ions are driven by ul-\ntrashort pulses, and can be attributed to accidental cancella-\ntions between different terms contributing to the dipole mo-\nment @22#.\nIn Fig. 2~a!, we observe that uae(V)u2 is reduced by more\nthan one order of magnitude compared to the predictions of\nthe dipole approximation at the relatively weak intensity of\n531016 W cm22. This reduction contrasts with the smaller\ndecrease found for a Li21 ion irradiated by a two-cycle\n800-nm pulse of 931016 W cm22 peak intensity @22,27#,\nand the even smaller nondipole effects found for a He1 ion\nirradiated by a 5-fs 800-nm pulse of 531016 W cm22 peak\nintensity @21#. As will be seen later, the duration of the pulse\ninfluences to some degree the overall effect of the magnetic-\nfield component on photon emission. However, the origin of\nthe difference between the results of Fig. 2 and the results for\nHe1 and Li21 can be attributed to the larger ionization po-\ntential of Ne61. That Ip plays an important role is demon-\nstrated in the upper part of Fig. 3, where photon emission by\nLi21 (Ip5122.5 eV) and Be31 (Ip5217.7 eV) are com-\npared for the same incident field @32#. Although the intensity\nis the same for both ions, the relative difference between the\ndipole and nondipole spectra is much less for Li21.\nThe strong dependence on Ip , and in fact all the major\ndifferences between the dipole and nondipole spectra, can be\nreadily understood within the framework of the recollision\nmodel. Only two key quantities need to be considered: the\neffective detachment rate when the electron is born and its\nkinetic energy when it returns to the core. In the lower part\nof Fig. 3 we show, for each trajectory of Fig. 1, the detach-\nment rate at time td of an electron with velocity v\u2019\n[pk(ps ,td) transverse to the electric field @33#,\nw~ t ,td!5\n4\np\n~2Ip!3\nuE~vtd!u2\nexpF2 23 ~2Ip1v\u2019\n2 !3\/2\nuE~vtd!u\nG , ~43!\nas a function of the harmonic order of the photon emitted at\nrecombination, @Ip1v2(t)\/2#\/v . We indicate the nondipole\nvalues of w(t ,td) by circles and the dipole values ~obtained\nby setting v\u201950) by crosses. The rate ~43! varies with the\nfield in the same way as the square of the ionization ampli-\ntude ~32!, a ion\n2 (t ,td), and has the same exponential depen-\ndence on Ip . Since the propagation and recombination am-\nplitudes vary far less in magnitude than a ion(t ,td) from\ntrajectory to trajectory, the importance of the contribution to\nthe spectrum of the different trajectories can be effectively\ngauged by the corresponding values of w(t ,td). As has been\nshown for He1 interacting with a short laser pulse @34#,\nmuch insight about the photon emission spectrum can be\ngained from this type of plot.\nIn the dipole approximation, w(t ,td) is largest for the long\ntrajectories, as electrons having short trajectories are de-\ntached at lower electric fields. ~See Fig. 1.! Therefore, short\ntrajectories tend to contribute less to the photon emission\nspectrum. However, when the magnetic-field component of\nthe laser field is taken into account, the opposite is true. This\nis due to the fact that pk(ps ,td) is larger for the long trajec-\ntories than for the short ones. The exponential dependence of\na ion(t ,td) on the initial transverse velocity means that the\nionization amplitude tends to be smaller for the long trajec-\ntories than for the short ones, and the latter end up dominat-\ning the spectrum over much of its range @20#. The secondary\nplateaus, which arise from the longest trajectories, almost\ncompletely vanish ~although they still visibly contribute to\nthe beryllium nondipole spectrum below V\/v52500). The\noscillations evident in the dipole spectrum largely disappear\nbecause at most frequencies only one set of trajectories ~the\nshort ones! significantly contribute to emission. The spec-\ntrum bends over as ionization is exponentially suppressed,\ndue to the relatively small value of uE(td)u for the short tra-\njectories that give rise to the lower harmonics, and to the\nlarge initial transverse velocity for the short trajectories that\nproduce the high harmonics. Finally, the reduction in har-\nmonic emission is proportionally larger for Be31 than for\nLi21 because the ionization amplitude varies faster with v\u2019\n2\nwhen Ip is larger.\nWe now evaluate the importance of the relativistic effects\nneglected in our approach by comparing, in Fig. 4, our non-\ndipole nonrelativistic results with relativistic results recently\nobtained by Milos\u02c7evic\u00b4, Hu, and Becker @20,24#. The case of\na Ne61 ion interacting with a stationary field of wavelength\n1054 nm and intensities 0.731017 and 1.431017 W cm22 is\nconsidered. Milos\u02c7evic\u00b4\u2019s, Hu, and Becker\u2019s calculations are\nalso done within the SFA but are based on the Klein-Gordon\nequation rather than on the Schro\u00a8dinger equation. The rela-\ntivistic results shown in the figure are the emission rates\npresented in Fig. 2 of Ref. @20#, rescaled so as to facilitate\ncomparison @35#.\nThe large differences between the dipole and nondipole\nresults indicate a strong influence of the magnetic-field com-\nponent of the laser field for these parameters. As in Figs. 2~d!\nand 2~e!, the nondipole spectrum is completely dominated by\nthe short trajectories at 1.431017 W cm22. At this intensity,\nthe maximum velocity of the electron, vmax , is at most 42%\nof the speed of light ~i.e., vmax\n2 \/c250.18) for any returning\ntrajectory. The good agreement between our nondipole non-\nrelativistic spectra and the relativistic spectra, aside from an\narbitrary overall factor, suggests that the relativistic effects\nthat are not taken into account in our model are not impor-\ntant. The difference is largest for the highest harmonics, as\ncould be expected, since vmax\n2 \/c2 grows linearly with the en-\nergy of the photon emitted at recombination for electrons\nfollowing short trajectories. Compared to the spectra ob-\ntained in the dipole approximation, the cutoffs occur at a\nslightly higher photon energy in the nondipole nonrelativistic\ncalculation. The origin of this effect is the additional kinetic\nenergy the returning electron acquires due to its drift along\nthe pulse propagation direction. However, the nondipole non-\nrelativistic calculation neglects other effects, such as the in-\ncrease in the inertial mass, which contribute to the kinetic\nenergy to order 1\/c2. In the relativistic results, these addi-\ntional effects lead to a small displacement of the cutoffs to\nlower energies. We have verified that the classical calcula-\ntions within the recollision model yield the same shifts as in\nNONDIPOLE EFFECTS IN PHOTON EMISSION BY . . .

Finally, we note that\nvmax\n2 \/c2 is less than 0.18 for the short trajectories responsible\nfor the generation of photons below the harmonic order\n30 000 at 800 nm wavelength, and is less than 0.10 for the\nshort trajectories responsible for the strongest photon emis-\nsion in Figs. 2 and 3. The relativistic effects neglected in our\napproach are therefore not expected to be significant at the\nintensities considered.\nTo conclude this section, we briefly discuss photon emis-\nsion by ions driven by ultrashort pulses. Spectra for three-\nand four-cycle pulses are shown in the top and middle dia-\ngrams of Fig. 5. The field is described by Eqs. ~1! and ~2!\nwith\nf ~h!5sin2S h2n D , ~44!\nwhere n denotes the number of optical cycles of the pulse.\nThe pulse is assumed to extend over all space.

Results for a stationary field of the same intensity are\nshown in the bottom diagram. The plateau structure of the\nspectra for few-cycle pulses largely originates from the tem-\nporal variation of the intensity rather than from the contribu-\ntion of very long trajectories @34#. ~For every half-cycle dur-\ning an ultrashort pulse, the trajectories are detached with\ndifferent probabilities and return with different kinetic ener-\ngies.! Overall, the magnetic-field component of an ultrashort\npulse affects photon emission in a similar way as for station-\nary fields. However, for short pulses, photon emission is not\nas strongly suppressed at the low-energy end of the spec-\ntrum, and plateau structures with oscillations are still visible.\nThis indicates that more than one electron trajectory is con-\ntributing to the emission of a particular harmonic in the larg-\nest part of the spectrum. Consider, for example, the low har-\nmonics. As noted above, these are weak in the stationary\ncase because they can be produced only through the return of\nan electron detached in a weak electric field. For few-cycle\npulses, they can also be produced through the return of an\nelectron detached near the end of the pulse, at a time where\nFIG. 4.

PHYSICAL REVIEW A 66, 063411 ~2002!\n063411-8\nthe electric field is strong but the intensity envelope of the\npulse falls off rapidly. Since the falloff prevents it from at-\ntaining a high velocity, the electron can only contribute low-\nenergy photons and is not deflected as much by the\nmagnetic-field component of the pulse.\nB. Selective compensation of the magnetic drift\nusing a second laser pulse\nAt intensities where the dipole approximation is valid, the\ncontribution of each electron trajectory to photon emission\ndepends primarily on the electric-field strength at the time of\nionization. At higher intensities, the contribution of a particu-\nlar trajectory can be drastically reduced by the drift induced\nby the magnetic component of the field. As noted above, to\nreturn to the nucleus the electron must be emitted with a\nnonzero velocity transverse to the electric field, and the prob-\nability for this is exponentially small in the tunneling regime.\nAt the intensities considered here, the Lorentz force acting\non the electron has a magnitude comparable to that exerted\nby the electric-field component of a relatively weak laser\nfield. This suggests that the magnetic drift can be compen-\nsated, at least for certain trajectories, by irradiating the ion\nwith a second, weak laser field, polarized along the propaga-\ntion direction of the intense one. In this section, we show by\nan example that a selective compensation of the magnetic\ndrift through this mechanism is indeed possible.\nWe consider the case of a Ne61 ion irradiated by a com-\nbination of two ultrashort pulses, both with the same carrier\nwavelength ~800 nm!.

The second pulse has the vector potential Aw and\nthe polarization vector e\u02c6w , with e\u02c6w[k\u02c6 . We assume that the\nsecond pulse is weak enough to be treated in the dipole ap-\nproximation.

In order to il-\nlustrate more clearly the differences between the dipole and\nnondipole results, the fast oscillations in the spectra have\nbeen averaged by convoluting with a Gaussian window func-\ntion. Let us first consider the trajectory of an electron \u2018\u2018born\u2019\u2019\nat time td5116 a.u. during the laser pulse. If the Lorentz\nforce was negligible, the electron would return to the nucleus\nat time t\u2019190 a.u., where it could recombine with the emis-\nsion of a photon of energy 7500v . However, the Lorentz\nforce is not negligible: in order to return the electron must\nhave an initial velocity of about 2 a.u. opposite to the direc-\ntion of propagation of the pulse. Correspondingly, uae(V)u2\nis much reduced, compared to its value in the dipole approxi-\nmation.\nIf, in addition, the ion is irradiated by a second two-cycle\npulse, of field strength Ew50.37 a.u., and delayed by tw\n562 a.u. with respect to the first pulse, the electron returns\nto the core if detached with zero velocity at time td5116 a.u.\nIn the center panel in Fig. 6 we see that the magnitude of the\nnondipole spectrum is now comparable to the spectrum ob-\ntained in the dipole approximation in the region of the\n7500th harmonic.

We\nconcentrate on the emission of 3.9-keV photons (V\n52500v).\nThe results calculated in the dipole approximation are\nshown in Fig. 7~a!. Each spike in this diagram corresponds to\na burst of emission of 3.9-keV photons. The spikes occur\nprecisely at the instants where, in the recollision model, de-\ntached electrons return to the nucleus with the speed required\nfor emission at this energy. Seven bursts are particularly\nstrong and have approximately the same intensity, showing\nthat in the dipole approximation the emission is dominated\nby seven groups of trajectories.\nHowever, the magnetic drift, when taken into account,\nchanges this picture dramatically. The central part of the fig-\nure, where the nondipole results are plotted, shows that all\nbut one of the seven returns that contribute most in the dipole\napproximation are severely suppressed.

The corresponding trajectory is de-\nflected less than the others, owing to the decrease in the\nstrength of the magnetic-field during the trailing edge of the\npulse. The width of the spike indicates that the duration of\nthe burst is about 20 as. ~It is worth noting that the intensity\nof this emission depends crucially on how the envelope of\nthe pulse decreases at the end of the pulse: the slower the\ndecrease, e.g., the longer the pulse, and the weaker the emis-\nsion.! The other trajectories make a smaller contribution;\ntheir main effect is to induce, by interference, the oscillations\nin the nondipole spectrum which are visible in the lower\ncurve of Fig. 8.\nIn Fig. 7~c!, we present uae(t ,V)u2 calculated for a super-\nposition of the same intense pulse with another Ti-sapphire\npulse, as discussed in Sec. III B. The electric-field amplitude\nof the second pulse, Ew , and the delay between the two\npulses, tw , are chosen so as to compensate the magnetic drift\nfor the trajectory giving rise to the strongest burst of emis-\nsion in Fig. 7~b!. As seen from the diagram, when the mag-\nnetic drift is compensated, emission is as strong as in the\ndipole approximation. The other trajectories are further sup-\npressed by the second pulse, with the consequence that a\nsingle attosecond pulse of x-ray photons is emitted. The\nsame conclusions can be drawn from the corresponding spec-\ntrum, shown in Fig. 8. In fact, one sees from the spectrum\nthat with the second pulse, emission is much more intense\nand occurs as a single burst ~note the absence of oscilla-\ntions!, not only for V52500v but also in a large range of\nfrequencies around this value.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have given a detailed account of the\napproach introduced in Refs. @21,22# for describing photon\nemission by ions interacting with laser fields ~stationary or\npulsed! whose peak intensities are sufficiently high so that\nthe dipole approximation is no longer applicable. This ap-\nproach can be viewed as a nondipole generalization of the\nSFA theory of Lewenstein and co-workers @1,10#. It applies\nto the dynamical regime that lies between the usual nonrel-\nativistic dipole regime and the fully relativistic regime. Us-\ning the nondipole nonrelativistic Volkov wave functions ~A4!\nand within the SFA, we have shown that the time-dependent\ndipole moment of the ion in the laser field, d(t), can be\nreduced to the simple form given by Eq. ~18!. Then through\na series of approximations, none of which compromise the\naccuracy of the calculations in any significant way, we re-\ncover the expression for the dipole moment derived by\nWalser et al. @21#, whereby d(t) is obtained as a sum over\namplitudes arising from particular electron trajectories.\nThe trajectories satisfy two simple classical criteria. First,\nif the electron is detached at some earlier time td , its dis-\nplacement along the polarization direction must be zero at\ntime t. Second, at time td its velocity along the laser-pulse\npropagation direction, v\u2019 , must be equal and opposite to the\naverage velocity that the free electron acquires in the propa-\ngation direction due to the Lorentz force between the times td\nand t. These are, of course, nothing more than the conditions\nthat must be imposed if a classical electron detached at time\ntd is to return to the core at time t. One recognizes immedi-\nately the language of the recollision model, modified so as to\naccount for the magnetic-field induced drift of the detached\nelectron. As in the intensity regime where the dipole approxi-\nmation is applicable, it follows that the main features of pho-\nton emission spectra can be understood from two key quan-\ntities, namely, the tunnel ionization rate when the electron is\ndetached and the kinetic energy of the electron when it re-\nturns to the core. In contrast to the dipole approximation, the\ntunnel ionization rates now depend strongly on v\u2019 , and in\nparticular on its magnitude relative to Ip and the magnitude\nof the electric field at the time of detachment. The overall\neffect of the dependence on v\u2019 results, at sufficiently high\nintensities, is a strong suppression of photon emission. Only\ntrajectories with t2td and uv\u2019u small contribute meaning-\nfully to the emission spectrum. As was emphasized recently\nin Ref. @5#, it is remarkable that multiphoton processes in\natoms interacting with intense laser fields, processes that\nwould at first sight appear to be exceedingly complex, can in\nfact be largely understood in terms of classical trajectories of\nelectrons that are detached and then subsequently return to\ntheir parent ion. These processes, in addition, provide a fas-\ncinating example of a system whose dynamics lies at the\ninterface between quantum and classical mechanics.\nTypically, a number of electron trajectories contribute in a\ncomparable way to photon emission in some frequency in-\nterval or to ATI spectra in some energy range. We have dis-\ncussed a scheme whereby a second laser pulse can be used to\ncontrol an individual electron trajectory. By the appropriate\nchoice of the laser parameters, the effect of the drift induced\nby the magnetic-field component of the pulse can be com-\npensated for a selected trajectory, and enhanced for others,\nleading to the emission of a single attosecond pulse of high-\nfrequency photons. The scheme has similarities to the pro-\nFIG. 8.

For instance, the reduced\nrecollision probability in the nondipole nonrelativistic re-\ngime means, as has recently been observed experimentally in\nnonsequential multiple ionization @38#, that these processes\nare strongly suppressed at very high intensity. This could\nwell impose a practical barrier to the experimental study of\nstrong-field recollision processes at intensities where relativ-\nistic effects become important. The selective compensation\nof the effect of the magnetic drift by a second laser pulse, as\ndiscussed above, may offer a way to alleviate this difficulty.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank D. B.
