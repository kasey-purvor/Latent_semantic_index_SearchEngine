The \nframework approach was used to analyse the data generated from 14 participants, \nand emergent themes coded. Data were analysed separately for providers and \ncommissioner organisations.  \nResults: Perceptions about how IPGs are managed in provider organisations varied. \nSome decision-makers considered that guidance is handled very well. Others think \nthat management is suboptimal and haphazard, and it is unclear about whether \nclinicians follow procedure for cautionary guidance. In commissioner organisations, \nIPGs are not seen as a priority by most and are not considered an area that will soon \nenter routine clinical practice. Moreover, commissioners felt that IPGs lacked \nrelevance as there is no consideration of whether procedures are cost-effective or \naffordable. In general, respondents perceive that the content and quality of guidance \nis satisfactory. To different extents, useful additional types of information for inclusion \nin guidance would be: prevalence, incidence, cost, patient views, consequences of \nusing the new treatment, comparative information, effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness. \n 2 \nImplications: Results indicate that management of IPGs in the NHS can be \nimproved. These results are important to understand the usefulness of IPGs and how \nthey meet decision-makers\u2019 needs in the NHS.  \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nNew interventional procedures are often introduced in a variable and somewhat \nuncontrolled manner. Following concerns described in the Bristol Inquiry (Kennedy \nreport),1 a programme of work within the National Institute for Health and Clinical \nExcellence (NICE) was established to improve and regulate how these procedures \nenter routine clinical practice. Since 2003, the Interventional Procedures Programme \nhas provided guidance on the safety and efficacy of new interventional procedures to \ndecision-makers in the National Health Services (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK)2 \nThe guidance includes a description of the technology, a summary of results and the \ntype of recommendation made by the committee (normal, cautionary, research only, \nshould not be used).3\n \n  \nInterventional procedures guidance (IPG) is not mandatory and therefore it is the \nresponsibility of each organisation to implement them. As the success of this \nProgramme is dependent on appropriate engagement from the NHS,4\n \n this study was \ndesigned to explore how NHS decision-makers respond to IPGs. We also aimed to: \n(1) identify how decision-makers perceive IPGs; (2) identify key problems related to \nIPGs, as perceived by NHS decision-makers; (3) determine whether there would be \nadditional information that would be useful to them; and (4) offer insights in how IPGs \ncan be improved. \nMETHODS \nParticipants and setting \n 3 \nAs healthcare delivery is organised differently across the UK, a purposive sampling \nstrategy was adopted to select NHS employees in England, Wales and Scotland \nrepresenting different roles, types and sizes of practices (Table 1). This sample was \nchosen to describe a range of knowledge interpretation and general awareness. The \nsampling frame consisted of 18 decision-makers selected using three strategies: a \nlist of known committee members of the Interventional Procedures Programme \nhosted at NICE; an NHS network group with an interest in public health; and \nsnowball sampling of key participants involved in decision-making on prioritisation of \ntreatments in the NHS. A recruitment letter with details about the study was e-mailed \nto every person contacted.  \n \nData collection \nData was generated from NHS decision-makers using one to one, face to face semi-\nstructured interviews, at a time and venue convenient for the participant. Prior to the \ninterview, participants received a \u2018participant information leaflet\u2019 explaining study\u2019s \nobjectives and purpose of the interview. All participants signed a consent form at the \nbeginning of the interview. Using an interview topic guide, participants were asked \nopen-ended questions exploring (1) how IPGs are handled in their place of work in \nterms of process, dissemination and monitoring; (2) their perceptions about IPGs; \nand (3) problems and improvements related to the guidance, including additional \ntypes of information that could be added to guidance. Following the interview, \nparticipants were also asked to rate on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from \nzero to ten, how much they would value different types of information if it were added \nto the IPG. They were also asked to rank which types of information would be most \nuseful at the time guidance is issued. The different types of information can be seen \nin Figure 3. The ranking exercise was designed to identify not only what would be \nuseful to have, but also, what is it that decision-makers really want. Data were \ndigitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. \n 4 \n \nData analysis \nData was entered into NVivo (v.7 computer software, QSR International, Melbourne, \nAustralia) for coding and analysis using techniques drawn from the framework \napproach.5, 6\n \n A coding frame was developed based on our initial research questions \nand emerging themes from the transcripts. Two researchers systematically coded \nthe transcripts. Thematic categories were developed by further refining the initial \ncoding frame and thematic charts were checked by at least one other researcher \nwithin the team. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or arbitration. Data \nobtained from the VAS and ranking exercise were subjected to descriptive analyses. \nMedians were calculated and radar diagrams were plotted. \nDifferent organisational arrangements of the NHS are in place in England, Scotland \nand Wales, however, regardless of country, NHS organisations can be broadly \ndivided into commissioner and provider of services. Decision-makers\u2019 views for both \ntypes of organisational arrangements were explored, and a stratified data-analysis \nwas conducted in order to identify potential subgroup differences in how IPGs are \nhandled and perceived by commissioners and providers. \n \nRESULTS \nOut of the 18 decision-makers contacted, 15 replied and agreed to be interviewed, \nalthough an interview time could not be set for one. Fourteen interviews were \nconducted by one researcher (TL) over a period of four months in 2008. The sample \nvaried in relation to setting, type of organisational structure (commissioner or \nprovider) and role in the decision-making process (Table 1). Respondents were \nwidely dispersed:  nine from England (six of ten Strategic Health Authorities), four \nfrom Scotland and one from Wales. \n \n 5 \nDissemination and management strategies of interventional procedures \nguidance  \nProvider organisations \nFigure 1 describes the different patterns in which provider organisations manage \nIPGs. Three main pathways of guidance dissemination were identified. In four \ncentres, all guidance is disseminated to relevant clinicians by a designated individual \nor a committee\/group within the organisation. In one centre, a designated individual \nwithin a committee\/group circulates only cautionary guidance. In two centres, an \ninternal system for dissemination of guidance did not appear to exist and clinicians in \nthese centres received guidance directly from NICE.  \n \nIn general, following circulation of guidance, the committee\/group or designated \nindividual expects feedback from clinicians on the status of the procedures in their \norganisation, or whether they would like to provide the procedures. For example, one \nrespondent explained that: \nD114: \u201cAll the guidance that is produced by IPAC, which is relevant to the trust\u2026 \ngets forwarded to the lead clinician\u2026 and it is expected that they actually feedback \nwhat they find\u2026\u201d \n \nIn five centres, for procedures with \u2018cautionary\u2019 guidance (see Figure 1), a \ngroup\/committee is expected to agree and decide on the implementation criteria. If \nthe procedure has cost-consequences while appearing to provide additional benefits \nto patients, or had the potential to improve survival, then a business case would be \nprepared by the clinician making the request.  \n \nMonitoring to ascertain whether new procedures are introduced appropriately and \nclinicians are compliant to the implementation criteria differed between respondents. \nSome audit all procedures; others audit only procedures where NICE interventional \n 6 \nprocedures programme has issued \u2018cautionary\u2019 guidance. In one centre the first 20 \ncases are audited before a final decision is made. Another centre has a database \nthat lists the names of the clinicians credentialed to do NICE interventional \nprocedures. If a name is not in the database, then that person should not be allowed \nto perform the procedure. \n \nOne centre however seemed to lack a structured process in the method in which \nIPGs were managed: \nK120: \u201c(\u2026) I\u2019m not sure it has a formal mechanism to react to it\u2026I\u2019m aware they \nreceive them, but I\u2019m not sure that anything then happens\u2026 I think that the \nexpectation is that within each specialty people will pay attention to them.\u201d \n \nCommissioner organisations \nFigure 2 describes the different patterns in which commissioner organisations \nmanage IPGs. In terms of dissemination, commissioners receive guidance directly \nfrom NICE. In three centres, this is then circulated across the organisation. In four \ncentres, guidance is also circulated to relevant clinicians and it is expected that they \nwill provide feedback on the status of the procedures in their organisation or whether \nthey would like to provide the procedures is expected:  \nH118: \u201c(\u2026) the interventional procedure guidance comes into the commissioning \npart of the organization and we have a group that is set up that\u2026 decides which \nprovider it is relevant for and sends it to the provider for them to feedback to the \ncommissioner.\u201d \n \nIn four centres, after guidance is disseminated, a business case would usually be \nprepared and presented to the commissioner organisation if the clinician wants to \nprovide the procedure.  \n \n 7 \nIn terms of monitoring, three centres actually monitor the uptake of procedures with \nIPGs. One centre expects that in the future, information about the number of \nprocedures with guidance, and how they are performed, will be collected. A lack of a \nstructured process in the method in which an IPG is managed was identified in one \ncentre. \n \nAlthough the majority of centres seem to have a process to handle IPGs, the general \nimpression was that the commissioner organisation works in a reactive manner, as \none participant said: \nQ125: \u201cSo we wait for NICE\u2026 to issue guidance and we wait for people to put in \nrequests then we begin to respond, as opposed to doing things more proactively...\u201d \n \nPerceptions about management and importance of guidance  \nProvider organisations \nSome decision-makers considered that guidance is handled very well and an active \nsystem within the centres exists to respond to guidance. However, one participant \nfelt that guidance could be better managed (especially for monitoring) if there were \nmore resources available. Others thought that management was suboptimal and \nhaphazard and it was unclear about whether clinicians follow the procedure for \ncautionary guidance: \nB112: \u201cI think is rather haphazard. I don\u2019t think we really have a good method\u2026I\u2019m \nnot sure that the trust is really taking it on board.\u201d \n  \n \nOne participant noted that guidance is increasingly seen by consultants as a support \nmaterial to get procedures approved: \nB112: \u201c\u2026I\u2019ve noticed more recently when consultants are submitting their \nevidence, will quote the NICE guidance if it supports what they want to do. So, I \n 8 \nthink they\u2019re learning that it\u2019s [NICE guidance] actually there to support them more \noften than not.\u201d \n \nFurthermore, IPGs were described as a method of confirmation to clinicians who \nalready perform the procedure, and to inform patients and those clinicians who have \nnever performed it: \nN123: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s confirming to people that are\u2026 using that procedure already that you \nare absolutely fine by doing that. It\u2019s a kind of a confirmation as opposed to an \nintroduction\u2026 what it is trying to do is to tell the wider institution about these \nprocedures, and maybe patients who might be thinking about them or indeed \nmaybe general practitioners that might need to know a bit, or maybe, say \ngeneralists, who might not have started doing those procedures.\u201d \n \nCommissioner organisations  \nIPGs are not seen as a priority by most. Respondents expressed that this is because \nthis guidance does not have the same mandatory nature as NICE technology \nappraisals have in the NHS within England: \nC113: \u201c\u2026we\u2019re more interested in technology assessment [appraisals] more than \nIPGs, because IPGs are not compulsory for the NHS.\u201d \n \nHowever, one participant highlighted IPGs as a way of identifying areas for future \nresearch rather than technologies that will soon enter routine clinical practice in the \nNHS.   \nQ125: \u201cMy perception is that we look at an area that NICE has issued good \npractice guidelines for further applied research; that this is not an area of work that \nwill be routinely brought into practice in the NHS at the present time.\u201d \n \nMany respondents were concerned about the lack of relevance of IPGs to the \ncommissioners as they do not inform commissioners whether the procedure is cost-\neffective or affordable:  \n 9 \nC113: \u201cBut for IPGs, it\u2019s \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018efficacious\u2019, OK, that\u2019s nice to know, but I need \nto know if it is cost-effective, if it is affordable, who to give it to, and so on.\u201d \n \nPerceptions about content and quality \nProvider organisations \nRespondents perceived the content and quality of IPGs as satisfactory, adding that \nthe quality of guidance is often dependant on the quality of the evidence available: \nB112: \u201cI think they\u2019re fantastic! \u2026I think that the advice is practical without being \ntoo restrictive\u2026 The quality of the recommendations depends very much on the \nquality of the evidence\u2026\u201d \n \nCommissioner organisations \nIn general, respondents at commissioner organisations perceived that the content \nand quality of guidance is also satisfactory. One added that guidance is \u2018useful\u2019 and \n\u2018educative\u2019: \nG117: \u201cThey can be quite useful; \u2026it has been quite an educative experience. In \nterms of what they do\u2026 they\u2019re fine.\u201d \n \nHowever, there were arguments that the content of guidance is not applicable to \ncommissioner organisations. This was also supported by two additional respondents \nadding that important information about costs and cost-effectiveness is absent: \nC113: \u201c\u2026the most important thing is the cost-effectiveness\u2026 that\u2019s why they\u2019re \n[IPGs] not very useful in everyday life\u2026\u201d  \n \nAlthough they broadly thought guidance was adequate, commissioners felt that it \nwas unclear whether the procedure is applied research, or is already in practice, and \nwhether the procedure is being recommended by NICE or recommended on the \npossible introduction on safety and governance issues: \nQ125: \u201cI think they\u2019re fine as far as they go, but they don\u2019t spell out the fact that this \nis about the introduction of a new technology\u2026 the impression I feel\u2026 is that this is \n 10 \nbeing recommended by NICE as opposed to this is guidance on the possible \nintroduction on safety and governance issues around introducing this. I think that \nthe balance between whether this is research or applied research and whether this \nis under practice isn\u2019t spelt out and I think that NICE guidance gives a false \nimpression.\u201d \n \n \n \nPerceived potential barriers to effective response to guidance  \nProvider organisations \nIt was highlighted that it is difficult to monitor procedures with IPGs within provider \norganisations, as these are not coded. \nA111: \u201cFor example code for coblation tonsillectomy. That is something that there \nwere great concerns over. It\u2019s only one way of doing tonsillectomy and it doesn\u2019t \nshow through in the coding and there\u2019s no way of telling from the data the hospital \ncollects how many coblation tonsillectomies are occurring...\u201d \n \nIt was also noted that some clinicians felt that guidance affects their clinical freedom, \npotentially creating some resistance in taking on board trust procedure. Moreover, \nthere have been concerns about how IPGs are interpreted, suggesting a degree of \nambiguity in the guidance:  \nB112: \u201cThe problem is sometimes people don\u2019t read the guidance properly and they \nput their own interpretation on the wordings\u2026 people tend to read what they want \nto read, they will interpret it as NICE has damned this when actually hasn\u2019t.\u201d \n \nOther problems were related to how NICE interventional procedures advisory \ncommittee (IPAC) is regulated and set up, and concerns about its representative \nnature were expressed: \nF116: \u201cAnother thing about the IPAC is probably the representative nature of the \ncommittee\u2026 there\u2019s an awful lot of white middle aged men on the committee! It\u2019s \nnot perhaps as diverse as it should be!\u201d \n 11 \n \n \nCommissioner organisations  \nThe main problem perceived by commissioners was that IPGs seem to lack context, \nconsider procedures in isolation, and lack prioritisation: \nG117: \u201c\u2026it looks at something small very much in isolation, and the overall kind of \nplace in the overall treatment is often quite important, so you need to know whether \nthis is something that would be absolutely first line, and would be the treatment for \neverybody... That\u2019s not always clear, especially when you start getting into some \ntertiary level stuff where you\u2019re really not sure how exactly a patient has been \ntreated.\u201d \n \nQ125: \u201c\u2026there is lack of prioritisation within the NICE process\u2026 they\u2019ve just issued \na guidance on all these new technologies over the year as if they were all likely to \nbe of equal benefit.\u201d \n \nThere were also concerns about the ambiguity of guidance. A couple of respondents \nnoted that there is confusion regarding the status of IPGs, giving rise to external \npressures: \nQ125: \u201c\u2026we had a request from the patient and his GP\u2026 They quoted the fact that \nNICE had issued interventional procedures guidance about this [a procedure] and \nthey took that as a sign of approval the fact that NICE had made some \nrecommendations about audit, about governance, about the introduction of an \ninterventional procedure. They took that as overall approval of the procedure and\u2026 \nthink PCTs should commission it. \u201c \n \nSuggestions for improving response to guidance and its content \nProvider organisations \nSome respondents felt that better management plans within provider organisations \nare required to deal with procedures with an IPG: \n 12 \nB112: \u201c\u2026we should have somebody sifting through it all, making sure that \nprocedures that have cautionary guidance are being used or not and then having \nfairly robust methods of checking that\u2026 people are following the guidelines\u2026\u201d \nMore robust mechanisms of monitoring were felt to be imperative. The need for \nefforts from NICE and the OPCS (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys) to \nidentify codes for NICE interventional procedures was highlighted by one \nrespondent. This was considered necessary for an improved monitoring of such \nprocedures. Moreover, one respondent suggested that decision-making about the \nintroduction of a NICE interventional procedure should become more centralised \nsince the decision-maker who holds the budget, does not often realise the impact of \nsuch procedure at the individual clinical units. Guidance should be circulated not only \nto relevant clinicians, but also to those who are responsible for budget allocation. \nN123: \u201cI think that the dissemination to certain managers that hold the purse strings \nmight be useful so that they know that this might be needed.\u201d \n \nMoreover, one respondent stressed that there should be better support mechanisms \nfrom NICE or the government regarding the implementation of guidance at provider \norganisations: \nA111:\u201dI think the big fault of all\u2026 government initiatives is that it stops at the \nguidance, and very often there isn\u2019t any real help to implement things. There isn\u2019t \nany real look to see how well they\u2019ve been implemented\u2026 NICE puts out this \ninformation, but it puts out into a vacuum and how individual trusts deal with it is up \nto them.\u201d \n \nAlthough quality and content of guidance was described as being satisfactory, \nrespondents felt that additional information on top of what is currently provided in the \nguidance would be useful. It was noted that there are issues surrounding the \nproduction of business cases. One respondent would like to see more readily \n 13 \navailable information to help inform business cases, and suggested that NICE could \nproduce some relevant information to help procedures being introduced. \nN123: \u201cit would be extremely helpful from a clinician point of view, when we\u2019re \ntrying to improve patient care and also introduce interventional procedures, if they \n[NICE] could even produce the business case in a way, and help us that way. \nBecause they obviously looked at that information\u2026 they may not need to put it in a \nsummary or whatever, but they could say, if require information with regard to \ncosting things, you know, somewhere where you can get it.\u201d \n \nAnother cited that it would be useful to include in the guidance information about \nwhether the speciality associations agree with NICE\u2019s decision, and details about \nwhat other centres are doing: \nK120: \u201c\u2026it would be useful to know whether the specialty association\u2026 agrees as \nwell that this is a reasonable thing to be doing\u2026 It would be nice to get some input \nfrom a number of centres around the country as to how many they\u2019re doing, what \nthe outcomes are, and to be able to talk to other units that are doing it.\u201d  \n \nIn general, respondents felt that in terms of additional types of information, they \nwould like to see information on costs of the procedure as well as the number of \npatients affected:  \nE115: \u201cthe areas where we need to go looking for more information surround all the \nbusiness case arguments, so the cost, the number of patients, etc, but on the other \nhand it is not within IPAC\u2019s remit.\u201d \n \nAlso, one respondent mentioned that it would be useful to have more comparative \ninformation between treatments: \nD114: \u201cI think the area of weakness is that there isn\u2019t a comparison data between \nthe two different procedures\u2026 it would be more useful to have more comparative \ndata.\u201d \n \n 14 \nThese findings are consistent with those from the VAS and ranking exercises. In \ngeneral, respondents rated that all types of information that were proposed would be \nhighly useful if included in the guidance. However, following the ranking exercise, the \nthree most valuable types of information that could be added to the guidance are: \n\u2018number of patients affected\u2019, \u2018consequences of using the new treatment\u2019, and \n\u2018effectiveness\u2019 i.e. how it works in standard practice compared with standard \nmanagement (Figure 3). \n \n \nCommissioner organisations \nOne respondent would like to see better monitoring of NICE interventional procedures, \nbut the majority were unclear about what can be improved in the current management \nof IPGs. However, they expressed improvements related to the content of guidance.  \nLike providers, one respondent cited that it would be useful to know what other centres \nare doing and wondered whether NICE would be prepared to include that sort of \ninformation in the guidance.   \nC113: \u201cSomething that is useful would be what happens around the country. What \nother PCTs do\u2026 When we get the requests from the clinician, they tell us \u2018oh, \neverybody else is doing it, apart from you!\u2019.\u201d \n \nIn order to help decision-makers make judgements about likely benefits and give an \nindication of hierarchy between treatments, one respondent would like to see a linkage \nand a comparison between guidance that was issued for the same clinical problem: \nQ125: \u201cNICE have issued guidance in the last two or three years on foam \nsclerotherapy for varicose veins, radiofrequency ablation for varicose veins and \nlaser treatment for varicose veins\u2026 they\u2019ve issued them all independently even \nthough they\u2019re all for treatment of varicose veins\u2026 if they\u2019re going to issue \nguidance in a number of new technologies in one clinical area, I can\u2019t see why they \ncouldn\u2019t reference the other guidance\u2026 Even if it wasn\u2019t an absolute judgement, \n 15 \nthey could give some indication of the hierarchy, what\u2019s likely to be superseded? Is \nthere poor benefits?\u201d \n \nAlso, it was noted that it would be useful if NICE could give an indication of what \ntreatments are not worth doing: \nC113: \u201cit might be more useful if they had at least what definitely is not worth \ndoing.\u201d \n \nAnother respondent felt that IPGs should provide more detail about the likely status of \nthe procedure in the NHS and that NICE provides advice to the NHS as a whole not \njust to individual clinicians: \nG117: \u201c\u2026Given that NICE is for advice to the NHS\u2026 they should be looking at the \nimportance to the commissioning body as opposed to advice to the individual \nclinician because they\u2019re giving advice to the NHS and sometimes that gets \nforgotten and the commissioning body is not an expert in every minor detail in what \ngoes on in a clinical treatment.\u201d \n \nIn general, decision-makers suggested that NICE IPGs would be more useful if they \ngave and indication of the cost and if they went beyond efficacy to effectiveness and \ncost-effectiveness if the evidence exists:  \nC113: \u201cThe most important thing is the cost-effectiveness. They don\u2019t look at that. \nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re not very useful\u2026\u201d \n \nG117: \u201c\u2026last week we had two that we were looking at the IPGs partly because is \njust to say \u2018is there any objective evidence on the safety and efficacy, particularly \nefficacy for individual patients?\u2019 But it still doesn\u2019t help us because of cost-\neffectiveness.  \n \nAlso, some respondents would like to see details about the prevalence and incidence \nof the condition because such information is not readily available and without this, it is \n 16 \ndifficult to make a decision as to whether a procedure should be implemented or not. \nMoreover, two respondents cited that guidance should incorporate patient and carer \nviews.  \nP123: \u201c[it would be useful to provide] a more detailed evaluation of an assessment \nof what the views are of patients and their carers who may be involved.\u201d \n \nBased on VAS responses, all types of information were thought to be highly useful, \nbut the ones that they would value the most were: \u2018number of patients affected\u2019, \u2018cost \nof treatment\u2019, \u2018effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018cost-effectiveness\u2019 (Figure 3).  \n  \nDISCUSSION \nThis study is the first to explore how decision-makers in the NHS manage and \nperceive IPGs. It identifies some potential barriers to the successful implementation \nof IPGs and identifies areas of improvement. \n \nThe findings of this exploratory study suggest that the process in which IPGs are \nmanaged varies between countries, centres and type of institution. It was found that \nguidance appears to reach commissioners and providers and in most institutions \nthere are efforts to have a structured process of response for IPGs. However, having \na process in place does not necessarily mean that the procedure is followed as this \ndepends on the value that decision-makers place on this type of guidance. \nPromulgation of guidance has been shown to have little effect on practice.7 The \npatterns of management identified in our research describe organisational responses \nto manage the implementation of new interventional procedures. In terms of \nperceptions, the management of guidance is suboptimal; there is a lack of a \nstructured process in some centres; and there is resistance to conform to guidance. \nThis indicates that improvements are required in how IPGs are handled and \nperceived in the NHS. Another point for analysis is whether commissioner \n 17 \norganisations should have a role in the management of IPGs as these are generally \nperceived as low priority and lacking relevance.  \n \nThere seems to be confusion about the status of IPGs, which provide guidance \nabout the safety and efficacy as opposed to NICE Technology Appraisals Guidance, \nwhich provides assessments about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of \nprocedures. Compliance with the latter type of guidance is mandatory in England and \nWales.  Our study suggests that there needs to be an improvement in how the \ndifferent types of recommendations in an IPG are perceived and the role of the \nProgramme requires better understanding.  \n \nAn interesting finding arising from this study was that the purpose of an IPG can be \nperceived as nothing more than a method of confirmation to those already \nperforming the procedure, or as information to generalists and patients about the \nexistence of such procedures. It was also noted that guidance can be perceived as a \n\u2018good practice guideline\u2019 rather than something that would soon enter routine clinical \npractice. These perceptions go against the purpose of this type of guidance as \ndelineated in the 2003 health services directive.4\n \n  \nIt was perceived that monitoring is an area that needs to be improved for effective \nmanagement of procedures in the NHS. The main factors that seemed to contribute \nto ineffective monitoring were: lack of coding, registries and resources. \n \nIn general, the content and quality of IPGs was perceived by providers and \ncommissioners as being satisfactory and that they addressed their remit. The \nrespondents from commissioner organisations expressed concerns that question the \nsuitability of such guidance to this type of organisation. One concern was the \nambiguity of guidance. It was also unclear whether the procedure is in practice or is \n 18 \nresearch. Another concern was the lack of context and prioritisation in guidance. \nCommissioners expressed that IPGs look at procedures as if they are likely to have \nequal benefit. It is unclear if these findings will be generalisable to all commissioner \norganisations, but are perhaps to be expected in an NHS environment, where there \nare multiple competing objectives which make decision-making complex. \nInterestingly, although commissioners felt that knowledge about cost-effectiveness \nwould be a good thing to add to guidance, they seemed more concerned about the \nlack of information on prevalence, costs and comparative information between \ntreatments. Despite the perceived value of cost-effectiveness data, decision-makers \nat provider organisations would also like to have more readily available information to \nhelp inform business cases. This includes information about prevalence, the \nconsequences of using the new treatment, and effectiveness. Adding such \ninformation to guidance would improve how decision-makers value and perceive this \ntype of guidance.  \n \nIt was highlighted that NICE should be reminded that it provides advice to the NHS \nas a whole and not just for individual clinicians, and therefore, more information \naround the procedures is required as guidance will also be considered by decision-\nmakers who dot have a clinical background.  \n \nThis study illustrates how decision-makers in the NHS value the concept of \ntransparency. There were remarks about the representative nature of people sitting \nin the advisory committee, and how they are selected, as well as whether individual \nmedical speciality associations endorse the recommendations issued by NICE. Also \ndecision-makers highlighted that they would like to know which treatments are \noffered in other centres. If there were national registers and appropriate coding \navailable for all NICE procedures, then this type of information could be more easily \nretrieved. \n 19 \n \nStrengths and limitations \nThe use of a qualitative approach was an appropriate method to explore how IPGs \nare managed in the NHS. In comparison to a quantitative survey, it allowed a \ndetailed exploration of a complex area making feasible the identification of decision-\nmakers\u2019 perceptions about guidance and the identification of problems and likely \nimprovements related to guidance.  \n \nThe study allowed us to evaluate the needs of NHS decision-makers in terms of what \nwould be useful to be added to the guidance to improve decision-making about the \nintroduction of new interventional procedures. By using a ranking approach with \nincorporated monetary cost for obtaining each type of information, it allowed the \nidentification of information that is genuinely useful given the constrained resources \navailable to the NHS. Moreover, participants came from a diverse background \nreflecting different cultures and organisational structures within the NHS, making \nfindings relevant to the wider UK context. \n \nThe study relied on perceptions and experiences of decision-makers, therefore \nactual practice may differ. Also, five out of the seven participants interviewed in the \nprovider organisations are members of the NICE Interventional Procedures Advisory \nCommittee.  It is possible that participant\u2019s exposure to decision-making in relation to \ninterventional procedures may have been atypical and therefore their views might not \nbe representative of the NHS as a whole. Although the sample size was purposively \nidentified, it is possible that radically different approaches might have been identified, \nhad more people been interviewed. There was, as described in the results, a degree \nof consistency between interviewees. Overall, our interviews enabled the \nidentification of a range of knowledge interpretation and general awareness towards \nNICE Interventional Procedures Guidance, which was our purpose. \n 20 \n \nConclusion \nIt is important to note that decision-makers did not express widespread \ndissatisfaction with IPGs and some very positive perceptions were reported. \nHowever, this study suggests that there is a disparity between what is happening \nand what should be happening and that guidance from the Interventional Procedures \nProgramme may not be having the desired impact.  This study therefore suggests \nthat the management and perceptions of IPGs could be improved.  \n \nCompeting interests \nNone. \n \nEthical approval \nNot required. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
