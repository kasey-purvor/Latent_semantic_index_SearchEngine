The late 19\nth \nand early 20\nth \ncentury research in \nthis region was seminal in thrust tectonics, alongside contemporaneous studies of \nthe Alps and Apennines.

Le ricerche pionieristiche condotte in questa regione a cavallo dei \nsecoli diciannovesimo e ventesimo, insieme ad altre ricerche condotte \nindipendentemente nello stesso periodo fra le Alpi e l\u2019Appennino, sono state una \npreziosa fonte d\u2019informazione ed hanno contribuito a gettare le basi della thrust \ntectonics. Le sintesi sull\u2019aggiornamento delle regioni di Assynt e di Ullapool \nnella Catena del Moine Thrust, realizzate da parte del British Geological Survey, \nhanno condotto all\u2019individuazione di lineamenti trasversali fino ad oggi non \nriconosciuti. In corrispondenza di questi lineamenti trasversali si verificano \nimportanti variazioni laterali nell\u2019architettura fragile-duttile della catena a pieghe \ne sovrascorrimenti, e delle falde di ricoprimento con carattere deformativi duttile \npresenti ad est del Sovrascorrimento di Moine. Il Lineamento Trasversale di \nTraligill interrompe la continuit\u00e0 laterale della classica Culminazione di Assynt; \nil Lineamento Trasversale di Oykel coincide con il limite meridionale della \nCulminazione di Cassley nelle rocce del Gruppo di Moine ad est di Assynt. \nEntrambi i lineamenti sono orientati parallelamente alla direzione del trasporto \ntettonico: si tratta essenzialmente di lineamenti che interessano anche il \nbasamento, lungo i quali si sono verificati processi di riattivazione di faglie pre-\norogeniche.  \nTERMINI CHIAVE: Sistemi di sovrascorrimenti, Lineamenti  \ntrasversali, Culminazioni, Catena del Moine Thrust,  \nHighlands settentrionali.  \n(*) British Geological Survey, Murchison House, West Mains Road, \nEdinburgh, EH9 3LA. E-mail: agle@bgs.ac.uk.  \nThe geometry, kinematics, mechanics and petroleum potential of fold-and-\nthrust belts are intensely studied worldwide (MCCLAY 1992, 2004 and \nreferences therein). Palinspastic reconstructions and balanced cross-sections \nparallel to the thrust transport direction are common; far fewer examine how \nlateral variations in thrust architecture are linked via so-called transverse \nzones that might for example comprise lateral culmination walls, strike-slip \nfaults, or lateral ramps (e.g. LAUBSCHER, 1985; MITRA, 1988; PAULSEN & \nMARSHAK, 1988, 1999; THOMAS, 1990; FERMOR, 1999; B\u00c9GIN & SPRATT, 2002; \nBUTLER et alii, 2006; TAVARNELLI et alii, 2004). Like these Alpine, Apennine, \nAppalachian and Rocky Mountain examples, the Moine Thrust Belt displays \na high degree of lateral continuity. Significant lateral variation has been \nreported, though related to development of duplexes and associated \nculmination structures (e.g. ELLIOTT & JOHNSON, 1980; BUTLER et alii, 2007).  \nNow, fully a century after publication of the classic Northwest Highlands \nmemoir (PEACH et alii, 1907), new detailed mapping and structural analysis \nin the Moine Thrust belt (MTB) by the British Geological Survey (BGS) \nhighlights previously unappreciated abrupt north-south lateral variations in \nboth thrust architecture, and in the internal configuration of individual thrust \nsheets and culminations. New maps in the thrust belt have been published \n(Assynt, BGS 2007; Ullapool, BGS 2008) and further new maps of the \nMoine rocks in the hanging wall of the MTB are in an advanced state for \npublication (BGS in press, a & b). Here we briefly report upon examples of \nbrittle-ductile and ductile transverse zones identified in the MTB and the \ninternal orogen respectively (see also KRABBENDAM & LESLIE in press, 2009; \nLESLIE et alii, in press, 2009).  \nA crustal-scale WNW-vergent fold-and-thrust-belt system is \npreserved in the Northern Highlands of Scotland, generated by \nBaltica-Laurentia plate collision during the Scandian (Silurian) \nphase of the Caledonian Orogeny. The MTB marks the north-\nwestern margin of that system and is a world class example of thrust \ngeometry and tectonics (fig. 1). The Moine Thrust defines the roof \nof the MTB, and the base of the Moine Nappe sensu lato (British \nGeological Survey 1997, 2002); as such it is regarded as a con-\nvenient boundary in northern Scotland between the external and \ninternal parts of the Caledonian Orogen (fig. 1).  \nCLASSICAL ASSYNT AND THE OYKEL BRIDGE MULLIONS  \nThe Moine Thrust Belt has been studied for over 150 years, largely \nbecause it contains a great variety of well \nA.G.

The late 19th century discoveries of the pioneering \ngeologists working in the Northern Highlands of Scotland, and of their equally \npioneering contemporaries working in the Alps and in the Apennines, provided \nthe empirical basis for the recognition of huge sub-horizontal shearing movements \nin the Earth\u2019s crust and their role in mountain formation. In his seminal work in \nthe Northwest Highlands, Professor Charles Lapworth drew inspiration from the \nAlpine experience of Arnold Escher and Albert Heim in his attack (1882-83) upon \nthe structure of the Eriboll region of the Moine Thrust Zone, especially the \ngraphic and beautifully illustrated accounts of the structures of the Swiss \nmountains (HEIM, 1878). Somewhat earlier and during his grand tour of the Alps, \nApennines and Carpathian Mountains (1846-47), Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, \nthough never accepting the validity of a major thrust disrupting strata in the \nNorthern Highlands of Scotland found, when visiting the Canton of Glarus with \nEscher, that it was \u00abneccessary to admit, that the strata had been inverted..... in \none enormous overthrow\u00bb. Murchison was further impressed in numerous \ntraverses of the Apennines and, \u00abeven without quitting the environs of Rome\u00bb, of \nthe importance of folding and faulting (thrusts) in disrupting the apparent \ncontinuity of the successions encountered on his travels with the \u00abmen of science \nof Italy\u00bb (MURCHISON, 1849).  \nPublication of the PEACH et alii, 1907 memoir on \u2018The Geological \nStructure of the North-West Highlands of Scotland\u2019 saw the climax of the \n\u2018Highlands Controversy\u2019, sixty years of intense, and at times acrimonious, \nstudy and scientific debate. The debate drew heavily upon the new theories \nof mountain building emerging from Continental Europe and Scotland and \nhelped to shape ground-breaking efforts of a veritable geological united \nnations at that time. Reputations were made, and broken, in the NW \nHighlands of Scotland; the mid- to late 19\nth \ncentury scientific discourse and \nthe principal players are brought to life by OLDROYD (1990). Murchison and \nLapworth, Professor James Nicol, geologists Charles Callaway, Ben Peach \nand John Horne and Director of the Geological Survey Sir Archibald Geikie \nall examined, and contested, interpretations of how it was that non-\nfossiliferous metamorphosed rocks (Moine psammites) could overlie fossil-\niferous sedimentary strata (Durness \u2018limestone\u2019) on apparently concordant \nboundaries.  \nThe \u2018Highlands Controversy\u2019 was intellectually solved by Charles \nLapworth (1883, 1884) on the key outcrops near Loch Eriboll (fig. 1), in the \nnorthern part of the Moine Thrust Belt. Archibald Geikie, previously a \nMurchison devotee, had by now superseded Murchison as Director of the \nGeological Survey and sent a team of surveyors to the NW Highlands, led by \nBenjamin Peach and John Horne. They were to settle the issue once and for \nall. Charles Lapworth quickly convinced Peach and Horne of the validity and \nelegance of his solution involving low-angle fault repetitions and so began a \nperiod of hugely productive geological mapping. Peach, Horne and col-\nleagues gradually worked their way south from Loch Eriboll along the entire \nthrust belt, producing exquisite geological maps along the way. That superb \neffort culminated with publication of the classic Geological Survey memoir \n(PEACH et alii, 1907) and of the \u2018Assynt Special Sheet\u2019 (Geological Survey of \nGreat Britain, 1923).  \nEast of the MTB, the structure of the central part of the Moine \noutcrop in Sutherland received little or no  \nFig. 2 -Mullion structures in Altnaharra Formation (Morar Group) psammitic \nrocks of the Moine Supergroup.

P005824).  \nattention after the rather cursory primary survey (READ et alii, 1926) \nthough the studies of the now classic, columnar, SE-plunging \nmullion lineations at Oykel Bridge are a notable exception (fig. 2, \nWILSON 1953). These mullions were described and interpreted by \nClough (in PEACH et alii, 1912) as formed by \u00abpressures from four \nsides in opposite pairs, leaving constituents to squeeze out...\u00bb \neffectively describing a constrictional strain ellipsoid. READ et alii \n(1926) thought that the mullions were formed by two separate \ndeformation phases, the first being contraction in a NE-SW direction, \nthe second extension along a NW-SE axis, with the latter phase \nclearly linked to movement along the Moine Thrust; \u00abthe stretching \nis in harmony with the dip of the Moine Thrust [\u2026] and may be \nregarded as an obvious accompaniment of the thrust-movement \ntowards the northwest\u00bb. In contrast, WILSON (1953), viewed the \nmullions as the product of \u2018rolling or shearing movements acting at \nright angles to their lengths\u2019. At a time when it was not appreciated \nthat folds could form, or be rotated, parallel to the transport \ndirection, Wilson thus denied any component of stretching parallel \nto the mullion axes (WILSON, 1953), and hence any direct \nrelationship between the formation of the mullions at Oykel Bridge \nand of the Moine Thrust, or any other NW-directed thrusting.  \nGEOLOGICAL SETTING  \nMovement along the Moine Thrust Belt is regarded as Silurian in \nage (van BREEMEN et alii, 1979; JOHNSON et alii, 1985; KELLEY, \n1988; FREEMAN et alii, 1998; DALLMEYER et alii, 2001; STRACHAN et \nalii, 2002). Shortening across the belt has been estimated of the \norder of 50-80 km (e.g. LAPWORTH, 1885; PEACH et alii, 1907; SOPER \n& WILKINSON, 1975; ELLIOTT & JOHNSON, 1980; MCCLAY & \nCOWARD, 1981; BUTLER, 1982; BUTLER et alii,  \n \nA.G.

In some places the MTB is a single, simple thrust plane; \nelsewhere thrust sheets are piled on one another in stunning \ncomplexity. Thrust sheets vary in thickness from km-scale to less \nthan 10 m and a wide range of different thrust geometries are \npresent. Foreland and hinterland dipping-duplexes, anticlinal stacks, \nthrust nappes, foldnappes and lateral ramps all vie for attention (fig. \n3; BGS 2007, 2008; BUTLER, 1982, 1984; BUTLER et alii, 2007; \nCOWARD, 1982, 1983, 1985; ELLIOT & JOHNSON, 1980). Variability \nalong an east-west cross-section (along the thrust direction) can be \nreadily explained by the very different rheological properties of the \nlithologies involved. Thin dolomitic siltstones and dolostones \n(Fucoid Beds Member, see below and fig. 4) comprise a particularly \nincompetent unit in which much of the thrust complexity is \nultimately rooted.  \nLITHOLOGIES IN THE MOINE THRUST BELT AND ITS \nENVIRONS  \nLithologies present in the thrust belt range from massive \nLewisian Gneiss and thick-bedded Torridon Sandstone, to thin \nincompetent dolomitic siltstone layers sandwiched between Cambro-\nOrdovician dolostone and Cambrian quartz-arenite (fig. 4).  \nIn the Foreland west of the MTB (figs. 1 & 5a), the oldest rocks \nare in the Lewisian Gneiss Complex. Felsic to intermediate \nArchaean orthogneisses (Scourian Gneiss) are intruded by the Early \nPalaeoproterozoic mafic and ultramafic Scourie Dyke Swarm (PARK \net alii, 2002). The complex is unconformably overlain by the early-\nNeoproterozoic Torridon Group that is dominated by several \nkilometres thickness of coarse red arkosic cross-bedded sandstone \n(Applecross Formation, STEWART, 2002).  \nThe sub-Cambrian unconformity with the Torridon Group is a \nremarkably planar surface and the Cambro-Ordovician formations \nrecord an extremely uniform stratigraphical thickness along the 200 \nkm strike length of the MTB from Durness to Skye, very much a \n\u2018layer-cake\u2019 stratigraphy (fig. 4; PARK et alii, 2002; WRIGHT & \nKNIGHT, 1995; MCKIE, 1991; PRIGMORE & RUSHTON, 1999; ARM-\nSTRONG et alii, 2006). In that sequence, arenitic Basal Quartzite and \nPipe Rock members of the Eriboll Formation are each 75-100 m \nthick. The younger Pipe Rock is characterised by abundant Skolithos \n\u2018pipes\u2019, distinctive trace fossils that form ideal strain markers \n(WILKINSON et alii, 1975; COWARD & KIM, 1981). The succeeding, \nand much thinner, An t-Sron Formation comprises dolomitic \nsiltstone and dolostone of the Fucoid Beds Member (10-20 m thick), \noverlain by coarse quartz arenite of the Salterella Grit Member (c. 7 \nm thick). The siliciclastic Ardvreck Group is succeeded by the \ncalcareous Durness Group, of which only the three lowest \nGhrudaidh, Eilean Dubh and Sailmhor formations occur in Assynt \n(fig. 4).  \nThe Neoproterozoic Moine Supergroup dominates the Northern \nHighlands east of the Moine Thrust (figs. 1 & 5a; JOHNSTONE et alii, \n1969; HOLDSWORTH et alii, 1994; SOPER et alii, 1998). Only the \nstructurally and stratigraphically lowermost Morar Group is relevant \nhere. The group is siliciclastic and dominated by psammite with sub\nsidiary layers of pelite and semipelite. Though sedimentary \nstructures are commonly deformed or obscured by regional \nmetamorphism (but by no means obliterated), psammitic lithologies \nin low-strain areas have provided much sedimentological \ninformation (GLENDINNING, 1988; KRABBENDAM et alii, 2008). In \nsuch areas, bed thickness typically varies from 20 cm to over 300 \ncm and sedimentary structures such as cross-bedding, nested cross-\nbeds, and soft-sediment deformation are common and suggest \ndeposition in a braid-plain fluvial setting. An original stratigraphical \nthickness of >3 km can be demonstrated east of the Assynt in Glen \n \nOykel, where a correlation with the Torridon Group in the Foreland \nhas been suggested (KRABBENDAM et alii, 2008). Slices of Lewisian \nGneiss are exposed locally within the Moine outcrop, these \nrepresent the basement onto which the Moine rocks were deposited \nunconformably.  \nThat Cambro-Ordovician strata in the MTB show such \nremarkable lateral uniformity in thickness and lithology (e.g. PEACH \net alii, 1907, p. 364; PRIGMORE & RUSHTON, 1999), and are so \nintimately involved with thrusting (Fucoid Beds Member), begs the \nquestion why any strong lateral variability in kinematics and \narchitecture should occur along strike in the thrust belt (fig. 1). The \nclassic Assynt Culmination is the largest of several culminations \nwithin the MTB (fig. 5a), the Traligill Transverse Zone (TTZ) \ntransects the Assynt Culmination (KRABBENDAM & LESLIE in press, \n2009). New BGS mapping has identified the large-scale Cassley \nCulmination in Moine rocks to the SE of, and structurally above, the \nAssynt Culmination (fig. 5a). The Oykel Transverse Zone (OTZ) \ncontrols the southern termination of the Cassley Culmination \n(LESLIE et alii, in press, 2009). These structures are reviewed in brief \nbelow.  \nTRANSVERSE ZONES AND THE ASSYNT AND CASSLEY \nCULMINATIONS  \nASSYNT CULMINATION  \nThe geology of the Assynt District is arranged around a bulge or \nculmination in the Moine Thrust plane (fig. 5a); the Assynt Culmination is \nenclosed within the trace of the thrust. Major individual thrust sheets \nbroadly overlap each other within the culmination in such a way that the \nmore northerly thrust sheets overlie those to the south. Thrust movement \noverall was to the WNW (290\u00b0N, MCCLAY & COWARD, 1981); most thrusts \ndip gently to the ESE. The structurally highest, and also largest, thrust sheet \nis the Ben More Thrust Sheet (fig. 5a). With a strike length >20 km, this \nthrust sheet now dominates the eastern and northern part of the culmination \n(KRABBENDAM & LESLIE, 2004); small klippen of the Ben More Thrust Sheet \noccur farther west (fig. 3, section B-B\u00b4; PEACH et alii, 1907; COWARD, 1985), \nproving that the thrust sheet was formerly much more extensive. The floor \nthrust in the culmination is defined as the Sole Thrust (fig. 5a), although this \nis not necessarily one single thrust plane.  \nThe Assynt Culmination is transected by the brittle-ductile \nTraligill Transverse Zone (TTZ). This WNW-ESE feature trends \nsub-parallel to the thrust transport direction, and is associated with \nan en echelon fault system cutting thrusts, discontinuity of the thrust \narchitecture, and oblique fold and thrust structures (figs. 5a & b). \nThe  \nFig. 4 -Generalised vertical section for Assynt, also to be used as key for figs. 3 \n& 5b.

Piercing point analysis of the \ntransverse system of faults proves that displacement occurred after \ndeposition of the Cambro-Ordovician rocks and pre-, syn- and post-\nthrusting (KRABBENDAM & LESLIE in press, 2009).  \n \nA.G.

The Achness Thrust is identified as the roof thrust to the \nCassley Culmination, the Moine Thrust defines the floor. The Ben \nHope Thrust lies between the Achness and Moine thrusts (fig. 5a); \nthe transport direction of each component nappe is top-to-the-WNW \nor NW on these thrusts. The Ben Hope and Achness thrusts \nconverge with the Moine Thrust at the SE corner of the Assynt \nCulmination (point A on fig. 5a), thus delimiting the Cassley \nCulmination in the south and southwest. This southern lateral \ntermination of the culmination is marked by a km-scale thick slab of \nstrongly deformed and foliated, steeply southward-dipping planar \npsammite lying in the hanging wall of the WNW-ESE sector of the \nAchness Thrust (fig. 5a); a well-defined culmination wall.  \nCritical evidence of the foreland-propagating deformation which \nbuilt this culmination is seen in the culmination wall where the main \nphase planar schistosity in the structurally higher Achness Nappe is \ndeformed by the main phase folds of the structurally lower Ben \nHope Nappe (LESLIE et alii in press, 2009). The culmination wall \ncoincides with a prominent belt of mullion structures which includes \nthe classic Oykel Bridge locality (WILSON, 1953; fig. 2). All of these \nmullions plunge SE; critically the mullions occur in both the Ben \nHope and Achness thrust sheets (crossing the trace of the Achness \nThrust), and deform earlier colinear fabrics in the Achness Nappe. \nTogether, all of these structural features at the southern termination \nof the Cassley Culmination characterise the ductile Oykel \nTransverse Zone (OTZ); the highly deformed lithologies in the OTZ \nstrike broadly perpendicular to the overall trend of the thrust front, \nbut approximately parallel to the regional thrust transport direction \n(fig. 5a). LESLIE et alii (in press, 2009) provide a more detailed \ndescription and analysis.  \nGROWTH OF THE CASSLEY CULMINATION  \nIn the evolution of the Cassley Culmination (fig. 6, but see also LESLIE et alii, \nin press, 2009), tight-to-isoclinal folds formed first within the structurally \nhighest Morar Group rocks in the incipient Achness Nappe. The earliest time \nslice in fig. 6 represents focussed slip on the Achness Thrust plane. As \ncontraction continued, translation stuck on the Achness thrust plane and \nstrain consequently began to transfer down into the footwall rocks. WNW-\nvergent fold systems then developed in the incipient Ben Hope Nappe. The \nAchness Thrust and structurally overlying folds were bulged upward in the \ndeveloping culmination. Earlier formed folds began to rotate towards the \npresent downward-facing attitude in the culmination wall and mullions begin \nto form.  \nStrain then became focussed on the Ben Hope Thrust; a branch line \njoining the Achness and Ben Hope thrusts was oriented (sub)parallel \nto transport direction and the culmination and the OTZ became more \nsharply defined. In time, that process repeated; translation stuck on \nthe Ben Hope Thrust plane, strain transferred downwards into the \nfootwall of the Ben Hope Thrust. Finally, movement occurred \nthroughout the region on the Moine Thrust. The development of the \nMoine Thrust and the degree and thickness of the associated \nmylonitic rocks seems to be broadly similar north and south of the \nOTZ, in contrast to the control exerted by the latter on the \nlocalisation of strain prior to this stage. Mullion development ceased \nin the OTZ. In a new phase of brittle-ductile behaviour, strain \ntransferred into the footwall of the Moine Thrust and the Assynt  \n \nA.G.

Sections in the left-hand column look down the regional transport direction to the SE,  \ni.e. down-plunge on the mineral\/stretching\/mullion lineation. Sections in the right-hand column are constructed parallel to the transport direction.  \n\u2013 Evoluzione strutturale della Culminazione di Oykel. Le sezioni nella colonna di sinistra sono orientate perpendicolarmente alla direzione del trasporto tettonico e \nsono allineate nel senso dell\u2019immersione assiale, coerentemente con la lineazione mineralogica, di estensione e dei mullion.  \n \nCulmination began to develop below the Cassley Culmination, \nleading to further uplift of that structure and further steepening in the \nOTZ.  \nThe evolution of the Cassley Culmination is characterised by \nalternating development of folds and thrusts,  \ni.e. an alternation of distributed and focussed strain. To maintain \nstrain compatibility, the Achness Nappe south of the culmination \nwall must have kept moving towards the NW in a quasi-continuous \nfashion along the Ullapool to Knockan Crag sector of the (proto-) \nMoine Thrust at the same time as the structurally lower Ben Hope \nThrust and its associated folding developed (fig. 1). In this scenario, \nthere must have been periods of differential movement along the \nOTZ. A dextral shear-couple would have resulted when rocks in the \nBen Hope Nappe were folding, and thus moving NW-ward relatively \nmore slowly than those of the Achness Nappe south of the OTZ. We \nargue elsewhere (LESLIE et alii, in press, 2009), that the observed \ncounter-clockwise angle angle between the strike of the steepened \nculmination wall and the thrust transport direction would result in \ndextral transtension. Transtension under such circumstances would \ngenerate a prolate strain ellipse (constriction) under most boundary \nconditions (DEWEY et alii, 1998, and references therein; FOSSEN & \nTIKOFF, 1998) and would thus provide a plausible explanation for the \nformation of the mullion structures during culmination building.  \nTRANSVERSE ZONES, THEIR ORIGIN, AND THE ARCHITECTURE \nOF THE MOINE THRUST BELT  \nTransverse zones in thrust systems are commonly understood to be \ncoincident with, and caused by, deeper-seated pre-existing structural features. \nThey have been documented mainly in the brittle, thin-skinned external parts of \nfold-and-thrust belts (e.g. THOMAS, 1990; PAULSEN & MARSHAK, 1999). The TTZ \nrepresents a brittle-ductile manifestation of such a transverse structure in the \nexternal Caledonides of the NW Highlands whilst the OTZ formed at deeper \nlevels as a ductile response in the orogen interior. Krabbendam and Leslie (in \npress 2009, fig. 9) examine possible templates which might have acted to \nconstrain both of these transverse zones. For the TTZ (KRABBENDAM & LESLIE (in \npress 2009), we have shown that there is good evidence for displacement on a \nbasement fault (Loch Assynt Fault) that affected overlying strata. The cover \nstrata, and the planar unconformity at their base, were faulted prior to thrusting; \nthat scenario is reproduced here in fig. 7. Such a fault would clearly affect thrust \narchitecture where only cover sequence was involved; even more pronounced \neffects would be expected where both basement and cover was involved.  \nThe results of sand-box modelling by CALASSOU et alii (1993) \nare instructive for understanding the generation of the TTZ. In that \nanalogue study, the effects of a basement fault in the footwall \nexactly parallel to the thrust direction, but with a uniform hanging \nwall, were examined. Those experiments showed:  \n\u2013lateral inter-fingering of thrust sheets, both in map view and in \ncross-section along the transverse zone;  \n\u2013 thrusts developing above the down-thrown side of the \nbasement fault propagating further on the foreland, defining a bend \nin the thrust front;  \nFig. 7 -Possible lateral variation in pre-thrusting template defined by a pre- and \npost-depositional fault in basement displacing cover strata after deposition. The \nthrust architecture that would potentially result during shortening aligned slightly \noblique to the pre-existing fault-step is reproduced behind (see also fig. 5b).  \n\u2013 Possibile variazione laterale nella ricostruzione palinspastica pre-thrusting, \ndefinita da una faglia con attivit\u00e0 sia pre- che post-deposizionale, che interessa il \nbasamento e che ha troncato gli strati della copertura sedimentaria \nsuccessivamente alla loro deposizione. Viene anche mostrata in secondo piano \nl\u2019architettura dei sovrascorrimenti che si otterrebbe attraverso un \nraccorciamento leggermente obliquo rispetto al gradino controllato dalla faglia \npre-orogenica (vedasi anche la fig. 5b).  \n\u2013a different thrust geometry in the compartments on either side of \nthe transverse zone, with fewer but thicker thrust sheets on the \ndownthrown side.  \nThese features are similar to the situation across the TTZ. We argue \n(KRABBENDAM & LESLIE in press, 2009) that the angular relationship \nbetween the strike of the pre-existing fault and the subsequent \nthrust transport direction must also be taken into account. There is a \nsmall angle between the strike of the Loch Assynt Fault (305\u00b0N) \nand the thrust transport direction (c. 290\u00b0N; MCCLAY & COWARD, \n1981). If, in the model of fig. 7, the transport direction is counter-\nclockwise from the strike of the fault, thrusts need to ramp up and \nover the basement step, and local transpression is expected. The \nscale and complexity of the disturbance associated with the TTZ \nwould grow larger with time, starting from an original relatively \nminor disturbance, explained, at least in part, by oblique \u2018piling-up\u2019 \nof thrust sheets against the initial basement step in sinistral \ntranspression.  \nA BASEMENT CONSTRAINT FOR THE LOCATION OF \nTHE OYKEL TRANSVERSE ZONE?  \nAlthough the stratigraphical constraints in the Cassley Culmination \nare much less clear, we envisage that the OTZ originated in a \nsimilar manner to the TTZ, such that the Lewisian\/Moine \nbasement-cover interface was displaced prior to thrusting, (possibly \nduring and after thrusting as well). The contrast between the \nnumerous branching thrusts which make up the Cassley (ductile)  \n \nA.G. LESLIE & M. \nKRABBENDAM  \nand Assynt (brittle-ductile) culminations, and the regions of folded, but not \ninternally thrust, Moine rocks to the south of the OTZ, is also reproduced in \nthe analogue modelling of LIU HUIQI et alii (1991), MALAVEILLE et alii (1991) \nand CALASSOU et alii (1993). Where basement is vertically offset, lateral thrust \nramps have their roots in the basal discontinuity and these ramps steepen as \nthrusting continues to excavate new thrust packages during foreland-\npropagation (THOMAS, 1990; CALASSOU et alii, 1993; PAULSEN & MARSCHAK, \n1999).  \nWe can see no reason that the location of the OTZ should have \nbeen determined by lateral variations within the Moine rocks; no \nsystematic change in lithological character, lithostratigraphy or gross \nthickness of these psammitic units occurs across the termination wall \nwhich might control rheology and therefore constrain the geometry \nand location of the developing culmination. Instead, our new \nmodelling of the regional gravitational field data implies that the \nlocation of the OTZ was strongly influenced by a prominent NW-SE \ntrending buried ramp, or series of steps, in the Lewisian \nbasement\/cover interface (LESLIE et alii in press, 2009). The locus for \nthe OTZ is directly comparable to the reactivated NW-SE trending \nbasement shear zone that is judged to have constrained the location \nof the TTZ (KRABBENDAM & LESLIE in press, 2009).  \nNSVERSE ZONES IN THE MOINE THRUST BELT AND MOINE NAPPE  \nThe Lewisian gneiss basement in the Foreland of the Moine Thrust Belt \ncontains a number of WNW-ESE striking Palaeoproterozoic shear zones (fig. \n1; COWARD & PARK, 1987; ATTFIELD, 1987; BEACOM et alii, 2001; KINNY et alii, \n2005). These re-activated sub-vertical basement shear zones have a long \nhistory of repeated movement prior to deposition of the Cambro-Ordovician \nsuccession on the Foreland (BEACOM et alii, 2001); critically, the regional \ngravity data permits extrapolation of these important structures beneath the \nMoine outcrop. KRABBENDAM & LESLIE (in press 2009) review the varied \nimpact that these structures may have had upon the architecture of \nCaledonian thrusting in the Northern Highlands of Scotland.  \nThe Stoer Shear Zone was reactivated as the Loch Assynt Fault \nprior to thrusting and underlies the Traligill Transverse Zone (fig. \n5a). The Canisp Shear Zone is associated with a monoclinal \nsteepening of the fabric in the Lewisian basement (e.g. ATTFIELD, \n1987) and demonstrable brittle reactivation (BEACOM et alii, 2001). \nAlthough, the Sole Thrust and base-Cambrian unconformity in the \nForeland are not appreciably displaced, the Canisp (and Strathan) \nShear Zone does line up with the approximate southern termination \nof the Ben More Thrust Sheet (BGS 2007), and the OTZ (fig. 5a). \nThe Laxford Shear Zone also coincides with significant lateral \nvariation in the northern part of the MTB (fig. 1). The Bhuirich \nDome (BUTLER, 1984; British Geological Survey, 2007) may have \nrooted, at least in part, above the Laxford Shear Zone. It should be \nnoted, in addition, that for some 30 km south of the Assynt \nCulmination, there are only a few small-scale culminations (BGS \n2008), and that the Moine Thrust over much of this segment is a \nsimple, smooth structure.  \nOverall, it seems clear that the lateral variations in thrust \narchitecture along the length of the Moine Thrust Belt are strongly \ninfluenced by the existence of Proterozoic shear zones, and the brittle \nfaults that commonly developed later along the older shear zones. \nOther faults or shear zones appear to have had little influence how-\never. These different relationships depend probably upon the nature \nof any Neoproterozoic or Palaeozoic (brittle) reactivation \nexperienced by the pre-existing structures, and displacement of the \nTorridon or Cambro-Ordovician cover sequences. Exploiting these \nNW-SE shear zones during Iapetan rifting has the potential to create \ntransfer faults separating normal-fault blocks (c.f. LISTER et alii, \n1986). Where continental collision and related thrusting is \napproximately frontal with respect to the older, rifted passive margin \nit deforms, then that inherited template will act strongly to control \nthe architecture of fold-andthrust belts. The older transfer systems \ncan thus be expressed as the transverse structures accommodating \nlateral changes in the 3-D architecture of the thrust belt.  \nCONCLUSIONS  \nThe Traligill Transverse Zone in the Assynt Culmination, and the \nOykel Transverse Zone at the southern termination of the Cassley \nCulmination, mark pronounced lateral changes in thrust architecture \nalong the Moine Thrust Belt and the internal parts of the Caledonian \norogen respectively. The Traligill Transverse Zone overlies a pre-\nexisting fault (Loch Assynt Fault), oriented at small angles to the \nthrust transport direction. The Oykel Transverse Zone lies above the \nSE continuation of the Canisp\/Strathan shear zones beneath the fold-\nand-thrust belt. Pre-thrust faulting displaced both basement and \ncover strata, creating a step, or series of steps, in basement. The \nresultant transverse zones are much larger in scale than the \namplitude of the original step (100 m in the case of the Traligill \nTransverse Zone). That relatively small disturbances in the pre-\nthrusting template can lead to significant lateral variations in thrust \ngeometry, may be the result of oblique, transpressional thrust \nstacking. In the OTZ, alternating focussed and distributed strain \nresulted in occasional periods of differential, dextral strike-slip \nmovement and constriction in transtension, one consequence of \nwhich is the classic mullion structures observed at Oykel Bridge.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nAGL and MK publish with the permission of the Director, British Geological \nSurvey.  \nREFERENCES  \nARMSTRONG H., RAINE R. & SMITH M.P.
