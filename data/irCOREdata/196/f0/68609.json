INTRODUCTION\nAfter a physical system has passed rapidly through a continuous phase-\ntransition, its order-parameter can have components with large differences\nbetween adjacent, but causally disconnected, \u201cdomains\u201d. In such systems\ntopological defects can form at the domain boundaries.1 This idea was\nproposed by Kibble2 in connection with the grand unified theory (GUT)\nsymmetry-breaking phase-transition of the early Universe, and has been de-\nveloped by Zurek3\u20135 who has estimated how the density of defects created\nPublished in J. Low Temp. Phys. 115, 89-105 (1999).\nM.E. Dodd et al.\ndepends on the rate at which the system passes through the transition. Zurek\nalso pointed out that this mechanism of defect production was applicable,\nin principle, to all continuous phase-transitions, and that it should there-\nfore be possible to validate some aspects of cosmological theories through\nlaboratory-scale experiments. The first of these examined weakly first-order\nphase-transitions in liquid crystals.6, 7 Later, the corresponding experiments\nwere carried out using the second-order superfluid phase-transitions of liq-\nuid 4He8 and liquid 3He.9, 10 All these experiments produced defect densities\nreported as being consistent with Zurek\u2019s estimates.3\u20135\nIn this paper we describe an improved version of the 4He experiment8\nin which particular care has been taken to minimise the production of topo-\nlogical defects (i.e. quantised vortices) by ordinary hydrodynamic flow pro-\ncesses. Our new results, of which a preliminary report11 has already been\npublished, show no convincing evidence of any vortex creation at all. But\nthey allow us to place an approximate upper-bound on the initial density of\nvortices produced by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.\n2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nA considerable amount is known about the properties12\u201315 of vortices,\nand about how they are created at very low temperatures16\u201318 but the mech-\nanism responsible for the vorticity that appears19, 8 as a result of passing\nthrough the \u03bb-transition (which separates the normal helium-I and the su-\nperfluid helium-II phases) is not understood. One possibility is that pre-\nexisting rotational flow caused by e.g. convection or boiling in the helium-I\nphase is, with the onset of long-range order, converted into quantised vortex\nlines in helium-II; this is quite distinct from the Zurek scenario which we\nshall now briefly describe.\nThe underlying idea3 is quite simple. A small isolated volume of\nhelium-I is initially held at pressure Pi, and temperature Ti, just above\nthe temperature T\u03bb(Pi) of the \u03bb-transition. The logarithmic infinity in its\nheat capacity at T\u03bb makes it impossible to cool the sample quickly into the\nsuperfluid phase but the pressure dependence of T\u03bb means that it can be\ntaken through the transition very rapidly by adiabatic expansion into the\nhelium-II phase, to a final pressure Pf and temperature Tf (Fig 1). Fluctua-\ntions present in the helium-I are expected to cause the nascent superfluid to\nform with a spatially incoherent order-parameter, corresponding to a large\ndensity of vortex lines. This scenario depends on the fact that the liquid can,\nin principle, expand at velocities comparable to that of first-sound, whereas\nthe propagation velocity for changes in the order-parameter is limited by the\nmuch slower velocity of second-sound.\nExpansion of Liquid 4He Through the Lambda Transition\nThe analogy3\u20135 between liquid helium and the early Universe arises\nbecause they both be considered to undergo second-order phase transitions\ndescribable in terms of Ginsburg-Landau theory.20 In each case the potential\ncontribution to the free-energy density can be written as:\nV = \u03b1(T )|\u03c8|2 +\n1\n2\n\u03b2|\u03c8|4 (1)\nwhere the parameter \u03b1 is positive at temperatures above T\u03bb and negative be-\nlow it, and \u03b2 is a constant. For liquid 4He the order-parameter is the modulus\nof the complex-scalar field \u03c8, i.e. the Bose condensate wave-function which\nis a solution of the Ginsburg-Pitaevskii equation.20 In the cosmological anal-\nogy the components of \u03c8 are Higgs fields.4, 5 In the symmetric (helium-I)\nphase T > T\u03bb and the time-average of the order-parameter \u3008\u03c8\u3009 = 0. Be-\nlow T\u03bb this gauge symmetry, is broken so \u3008\u03c8\u3009 becomes non-zero, and the\nreal and imaginary parts of the potential in equation 1 acquire the same\n\u201csombrero\u201d shape as the corresponding cosmological free energy expressed\nin terms of Higgs fields (Fig. 2). In the early Universe a symmetry-breaking\nphase-transition from a false-vacuum state to a true-vacuum state is thought\nto have occurred once the temperature had fallen to \u223c 1027K, about 10\u221235 s\nafter the big bang. Although there are many variants of the basic model,\nwith and without inflation, it is believed that a variety of topological defects2\nwould have been produced in the transition because an event horizon pre-\nvented adjacent regions from being causally connected. Cosmic strings21 \u2014\nthin tubes of false vacuum \u2014 are one such defect and may have had a role\nin galaxy formation. It is these that correspond to the quantised vortices\nfound in helium-II. The analogy between the helium and cosmological phase\ntransitions may thus be summarised as follows \u2013\nHiggs field 1 \u2190\u2192 Re \u03c8\nHiggs field 2 \u2190\u2192 Im \u03c8\nFalse vacuum \u2190\u2192 He I\nTrue vacuum \u2190\u2192 He II\nCosmic string \u2190\u2192 quantized vortex line\n3. DETECTING VORTICITY\nIn our initial experiments,8, 23 the vortex density was measured by\nrecording the attenuation of a sequence of second-sound pulses propagated\nthrough the helium-II. We expected that, following an expansion, the pulse\namplitude would grow towards its vortex-free value as the tangle decayed\nand the attenuation decreased.\nM.E. Dodd et al.\nA considerable amount is known about the decay13\u201315, 24 of hydrody-\nnamically created vortex tangles in helium-II. Numerical simulations24, 25\ngive a good qualitative description of the manner in which a homogeneous\nisotropic tangle evolves and decays. The rate at which it occurs in this\ntemperature range is governed by the Vinen14 equation\ndL\ndt\n= \u2212\u03c72\nh\u00af\nm4\nL2 (2)\nwhere L is the vortex-line density at time t, the 4He atomic mass is m4, and\n\u03c72 is a dimensionless parameter. The relationship between vortex density\nand second-sound attenuation is known15 from experiments with rotating\nhelium, and may for present purposes be written\nL =\n6c2\n\u03baBd\nln(S0\/S) (3)\nwhere c2 is the velocity of second-sound, S and S0 are the signal amplitudes\nwith and without vortices present respectively. B is a weakly temperature\ndependent parameter, \u03ba = h\/m4 is the quantum of circulation, and d is the\ntransducer separation. Integrating equation 2 and substituting for L from\nequation 3 gives an expression for the recovery of the signal:\n1\nln(S0)\u2212 ln(S)\n=\n6c2\n\u03baBd\n(\n\u03c72\u03bat\n2\u03c0\n+\n1\nL1\n)\n(4)\nwhere L1 is the vortex density immediately after the expansion. All the\nconstants in this expression are known, although \u03c72 and B do not seem to\nhave been measured accurately within the temperature range of interest.\n4. THE FIRST EXPERIMENT\nA description of our first attempt to realise a bulk version4 of Zurek\u2019s\nexperiment has been given in a previous paper23 but, briefly, the arrangement\nwas as follows. A cell with phosphor-bronze concertina walls was filled, by\ncondensing in isotopically26 pure 4He through a capillary tube, and then\nsealed with a needle-valve (Fig. 3). The top of the cell was fixed rigidly to\nthe cryostat but its bottom surface could be moved to compress the liquid, or\nreleased to expand it, using a pull-rod from the top of the cryostat. The cell\nwas in vacuo surrounded by a reservoir of liquid 4He at \u223c 2K. A Straty-\nAdams capacitance gauge27 recorded the pressure in the cell and carbon-\nresistors were used as thermometers, one in the reservoir, one on the cell.\nThe temperature of the cell could be adjusted by means of an electrical heater\nand a breakable thermal link to the 2K reservoir. A trigger mechanism on\nExpansion of Liquid 4He Through the Lambda Transition\nthe mechanical linkage allowed the cell to increase its volume by \u223c 20% very\nrapidly under the influence of its own internal pressure.\nAs described above, the vortex density was inferred from the amplitude\nof second-sound pulses created with a thin-film heater. The signal was de-\ntected with a bolometer and passed, via a cryogenic FET preamplifier, to a\nNicolet 1280 data processor which recorded some \u223c 200 pulses during 1\u20132 s\nfollowing the expansion. The last pulses in the sequence define S0, the signal\namplitude in the (virtual) absence of vortices.28 Fig. 4 shows examples of\ndata recorded with this first version of the experiment.\nThere was a \u201cdead period\u201d of about 50ms after the mechanical shock\nof the expansion which caused vibrations that obscured the signals. The ini-\ntial vortex-density was therefore obtained from plots such as Fig. ??(a) by\nback-extrapolation to the moment t = 0 of traversing the transition and was\nfound to be \u223c 1012\u22121013m\u22122 consistent with the theoretical expectation.3\u20135\nHowever, an unexpected observation in these initial experiments8 was that\nsmall densities of vortices were created even for expansions that occurred\nwholly in the superfluid phase (Fig. 4c), provided that the starting point\nwas very close to T\u03bb. The phenomenon was initially\n23 attributed to vor-\ntices produced in thermal fluctuations within the critical regime, but it was\npointed out29 that effects of this kind are only to be expected for expansions\nstarting within a few microkelvin of the transition, i.e. much closer than the\ntypical experimental value of a few millikelvin. The most plausible interpre-\ntation \u2014 that the vortices in question were of conventional hydrodynamic\norigin, arising from non-idealities in the design of the expansion chamber\n\u2014 was disturbing, because expansions starting above T\u03bb traverse the same\nregion. Thus some, at least, of the vortices seen in expansions through the\ntransition were probably not attributable to the Zurek-Kibble mechanism\nas had been assumed. It has been of particular importance, therefore, to\nundertake a new experiment with as many as possible of the non-idealities\nin the original design eliminated or minimised.\n5. THE NEW EXPERIMENT\nAn ideal experiment would avoid all fluid flow parallel to surfaces dur-\ning the expansion. This could, in principle, be accomplished by the radial\nexpansion of a spherical volume, or the axial expansion of a cylinder with\nstretchy walls. In neither of these cases would there be any relative motion\nof fluid and walls in the direction parallel to the walls, and hence no hydro-\ndynamic production of vortices. However, it is impossible to eliminate the\neffects of fluid-flow completely from any real apparatus. At the \u03bb-transition\nthe critical velocity tends to zero, so any finite flow-velocity will create vor-\nM.E. Dodd et al.\nticity. However, the period during which this happens is very short; the\nentire expansion takes only a few milliseconds so only limited growth can\noccur from the surface-vorticity sheet of half-vortex-rings.30\nWith hindsight, we can identify the principal causes of unintended vor-\ntex creation in the original experiment,8, 23 in order of importance, as follows:\n(a) expansion of liquid into the cell from the filling capillary, which was closed\nby a needle valve 0.5m up-stream; (b) expansion of liquid out of a shorter\ncapillary connecting the cell to the Straty-Adams capacitive pressure-gauge;\n(c) flow out of and past the fixed yoke (a U-shaped structure) on which the\nsecond-sound transducers were mounted. In addition, (d) there were the\nundesirable transients caused by the expansion system bouncing against the\nmechanical stop at room temperature. The walls of the cell were made from\nbronze bellows,8, 23 rather than being a stretchy cylinder, but the effects of\nthe flow parallel to the convoluted surfaces were relatively small.\nThe design of our new expansion cell (Fig. 5) addressed all the listed\nproblems, as follows: (a) a hydraulically-operated needle-valve eliminated\nthe dead-volume of capillary tube; (b) the phosphor-bronze diaphragm of the\npressure gauge27 became an integral part of the upper cell-wall eliminating\nthe long tube leading to the pressure gauge; (c) the cell was shortened from\n25mm to \u223c 5mm so that the heater-bolometer pair could be mounted flush\nwith its top and bottom inner surfaces, thereby eliminating any need for a\nyoke; (d) some damping of the expansion was provided by the addition of a\n(light motor-vehicle) hydraulic shock-absorber.\nThe operation of the apparatus, the technique of data collection and\nanalysis were much as described previously8, 23 except that the rate at which\nthe sample passed through the \u03bb-transition was determined directly by simul-\ntaneous measurements of the position31 of the pull-rod (giving the volume of\nthe cell, and hence its pressure) and the temperature of the cell. We define\nthe dimensionless distance from the transition by\n\u01eb =\nT\u03bb \u2212 T\nT\u03bb\n(5)\nand the quench time \u03c4q by\n1\n\u03c4q\n=\n(\nd\u01eb\ndt\n)\n\u01eb=0\n(6)\nFig. 6 shows a typical evolution of \u01eb with time during an expansion. In\nFig. 6(a), which plots the full expansion period, it is evident that the system\n\u201cbounces\u201d momentarily near \u01eb = 0.02, but without passing back through the\ntransition. The effect is believed to be associated with the onset of damping\nfrom the shock absorber, after backlash in the system has been taken up.\nExpansion of Liquid 4He Through the Lambda Transition\nThe quench time is readily determined from \u01eb(t) near the transition. In\nthe case illustrated in Fig. 6, shown in expanded form in part (b), it was\n\u03c4q = 17 \u00b1 1ms. We are thus able take both the pressure-dependence of T\u03bb,\nand the non-constant rate of expansion, explicitly into account.\n6. RESULTS FROM THE NEW CELL\nThe improvements in the cell-design intended to eliminate vortices orig-\ninating from conventional fluid-flow were clearly successful; as we had hoped,\nand unlike the first cell, expansion trajectories that stay within the super-\nfluid phase, even those starting as close as 42mK to the transition, create\nno detectable vorticity (Fig. 7).\nWe were surprised, however, to discover that no detectable vorticity was\ncreated even when the expansion trajectory passed through the transition.\nSignal amplitudes measured just after two such expansions are shown by\nthe data points of Fig. 8. It is immediately evident that, unlike the results\nobtained from the original cell,8 there is now no evidence of any systematic\ngrowth of the signal amplitude with time or, correspondingly, for the creation\nof any vortices at the transition. One possible reason is that the density of\nvortices created is smaller than the theoretical estimates,3\u20135 but we must\nalso consider the possibility that they are decaying faster than they can be\nmeasured.\n7. THE DECAY OF A VORTEX TANGLE\nTo try to clarify matters, we performed a subsidiary set of experiments,\ndeliberately creating vortices by conventional means and then following their\ndecay by measurements of the recovery of the second-sound signal amplitude.\nBy leaving the needle-valve open, so that \u223c 0.2 cm3 of liquid from the dead\nvolume outside the needle-valve actuator-bellows squirted into the cell during\nan expansion, we could create large densities of vorticity and observe their\ndecay. Despite the highly non-equilibrium situation that arises immediately\nfollowing the expansion, as liquid squirts into the cell, it was found that the\ntemperature reached a steady value after \u223c 6ms. Fig. 9 shows two examples\nof attenuation plots ([ln(S\/S0)]\n\u22121 against time t) and these always, within\nthe experimental errors, had the linear form predicted by equation 4. Fig. 10\nsummarises the results of a number of expansions from which it was possible\nto determine \u03c72\/B as a function of temperature and pressure. We found\nthat \u03c72\/B was weakly temperature-dependent and over the range of interest,\n0.02 < \u01eb < 0.06 it could be approximated by \u03c72\/B = 0.004 \u00b1 0.001.\nThis measured value of \u03c72\/B was then used to calculate the evolution of\nM.E. Dodd et al.\nS\/S0 with time for different values of L1, assuming B = 1, yielding the\ncurves shown in Fig. 8. From the \u03c4q derived from the gradient in Fig 6, and\nZurek\u2019s estimate (based on renormalisation-group theory) of\nLRG =\nL0\n(\u03c4q\/\u03c40)\n2\/3\nwhere L0 = 1.2\u00d7 10\n12m\u22122, \u03c40 = 100ms (7)\nwe are thus led to expect that L1 \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\n12m2. Direct comparison of the\ncalculated curves and measured data in Fig. 11 shows that this is plainly\nnot the case. In fact, the data suggest that L1, the vorticity created by the\ntransition, is no more than 1010m\u22122, smaller than the expected value by at\nleast two orders-of-magnitude.\n8. DISCUSSION\nGiven the apparently positive outcome of the earlier investigations,8\nthe null result of the present experiment has come as something of a sur-\nprise. There are several points to be made. First, Zurek did not expect his\nestimates of L1 be accurate to better than one, or possibly two, orders-of-\nmagnitude, and his more recent estimate32 suggests somewhat lower defect-\ndensities. So it remains possible that his picture3\u20135, 32 is correct for 4He in\nall essential details, and that an improved experiment with faster expansions\nnow being planned will reveal evidence of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism at\nwork in liquid 4He. Secondly, it must be borne in mind that (2), and the\nvalue of \u03c7\/B measured (from plots like those in Fig. 10) from the data of\nFig. 9, refer to hydrodynamically generated vortex lines. Vorticity gener-\nated in the nonequilibrium phase transition might perhaps be significantly\ndifferent, e.g. in respect of its loop-size distribution.33 It could therefore\ndecay faster, and might consequently be unobservable in the present exper-\niments. Thirdly, it is surprising to us that the 3He experiments9, 10 seem\nto agree with Zurek\u2019s original estimates3\u20135 whereas the present experiment\nshows that they overstate L1 by at least two orders-of-magnitude. It is not\nyet known for sure why this should be, although an interesting explanation\nof the apparent discrepancy has recently been suggested34 by Karra and\nRivers. They suggest that fluctuations near to T\u03bb may change the winding\nnumber, i.e. reduce the density of vortices produced in the 4He experiment,\nand they show that the analogous density reduction would be much smaller\nin the case of the 3He experiments.\nExpansion of Liquid 4He Through the Lambda Transition\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions or correspondence with S.N.\nFisher, A.J.
