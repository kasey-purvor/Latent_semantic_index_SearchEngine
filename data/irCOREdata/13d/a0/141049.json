The consequence of the latter\non aquatic life cannot be understated. Whilst maintaining an effluent standard is of\nvital importance this has to be balanced against the capital costs of RBC units. In\naddition to detailing reasons for defects associated with RBC\u2019s this paper presents a\nnovel design approach for shaftless RBC\u2019s. This novel design takes cognisance of the\nmechanisms and reasons for mechanical failure, thereby reducing occurrence of loss\noperation of RBC units and ensuring that the effluent continually meets discharge\nstandards. The added significance of the design is a 50% reduction in costs.\nKey words- Corrosion fatigue, hydrogen embrittlement, microbiologically influenced\ncorrosion, rotating biological contactor.\n2Introduction\nThe RBC process is used worldwide for both municipal and industrial wastewater\ntreatment. The principle of the RBC was originated in the early part of the century and\ntoday there are many thousands of units operating world wide. RBC units can be\ndesigned for both organic carbon removal and nitrification. The RBC operates\ncontinuously throughout its life, however a break in operation will necessitate\nattention by the operator to maintain effluent consent standards. Failure to meet\nconsent standards can have disastrous consequences for life in the nearby estuary.\nFurthermore heavy fines can result from failure to meet the compliance set. For\nexample in March 2002 Anglian water, UK, was fined \u00a3200,000 for polluting the\nwater in Crouch (Essex, UK) [1], the highest fine ever levied at a UK water company\nfor failing to meet consent standards.\nTypically RBC\u2019s are used for sewage treatment in areas having a population of up to\n5000 [2, 3, 4]. An RBC unit consists of segmented corrugated polymer discs attached\ntogether to form a media pack as illustrated in figure 1 (4 media packs). The polymer\ndiscs, also referred to as media panels, are held within an enclosed basin, submerged\nby approximately 40% of the surface area. Wastewater passes through the basin as the\ndisks slowly rotate, at approximately 1 revolution per minute, exposing the biological\ngrowth (biomass) on the media discs alternately to the wastewater, and to the\nsurrounding air.\n3Figure 1 Rotating Biological Contactor\nA media pack consisting of a collection of media panels, represents one stage of the\ntreatment process. The biological population that inhabits each stage on an RBC train\nreflects the environmental and loading conditions specific to each stage; consequently\na succession of microfauna develops from stage to stage consistent with the decrease\nin organic loading with each succeeding stage. The dominant growth in the first stages\nfrequently consists of zoogleal and filamentous bacteria. When the media is exposed\nto the atmosphere, the liquid film boundary at the air interface immediately becomes\nsaturated with dissolved oxygen (DO). This saturation in turn results in an increase in\nthe mass of oxygen that diffuses into the biofilm. When the media is submerged,\noxygen transfer can occur either into or out of the biofilm depending on bulk liquid\nDO levels and the degree of mixing of the liquid film with the bulk liquid. The overall\nperformance of the biofilm is influenced by both the mass transfer and biological\nkinetic considerations.\n4Whilst it is recognised that the RBC is effective for sewage treatment, several Water\nCompanies in the U.K, USA, Canada, etc. have experienced mechanical failures well\nbefore their expiry dates. This has resulted in the discharge of effluent not meeting\nconsent standards forcing operators to adopt alternative treatment methods. In an in-\ndepth investigation by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency [5] into the design,\noperation and maintenance of RBC\u2019s, it was concluded that whilst improvements in\nthe design of RBC\u2019s can result in more robust units, the loss of mechanical integrity of\nthese units is common and unpredictable. Failures reported by Brenner included shaft\nbreakage, stub shaft damage, media degradation and damage, and bearing failure. Any\none, or combination, will result in the loss of operation of the unit.\nMba et. al [6] presented results of a mechanical audit on over 200 RBC\u2019s , the largest\nsurvey ever undertaken to date, cataloguing several sudden and catastrophic\nmechanical failures on RBC\u2019s that resulted in loss of operation. Other authors [7, 8, 9]\nhave also reported mechanical failures in RBC units.\nCauses of mechanical failure\nThe major factors that have caused mechanical failures on RBC\u2019s [6] include:\nI. The effect of the biofilm on the mechanical integrity of RBCs\nThe RBC biofilm has two major influences on the mechanical integrity of RBCs;\nstructural loading and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).\n5I.i Structural loading\nAn understanding of the dynamic loading on RBC components is vital in determining\nits mechanical operational life. The loading in this instance is the biomass\/biofilm\ngrowth on the media panels, water lifted during rotation and drag on the media panels\nduring rotation. Furthermore, observations of biomass thickness over differing\nseasonal periods have identified bridging of biomass on some units and this results in\ngrowths exceeding 5mm in depth, see figure 2. Bridging must be avoided, as it results\nin loss of effective surface area for treatment and increases the loading on the support\nstructure by several multiples. However, estimating anticipated biomass growth is\nextremely difficult, as it depends on the strength of local sewage (wastewater) being\ntreated.\nI.ii Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC).\nWhen sulphide is present, either in the influent wastewater or by its production deep\nwithin the biofilm, sulphide oxidising bacteria (SOB) such as Beggiatoa will grow on\nthe biofilm surface. The production of sulphide within the biofilm is due to oxygen\ndepletion. Several authors [5, 10, 11, 12 ,13] have sighted structural and operational\nproblems on RBC\u2019s with heavy biomass growth, due to the presence of Beggiatoa.\n6Figure 2 Biomass bridging across a section of the media pack\nIt is well documented that microbiologically influenced corrosion leads to rapid\nmaterial deterioration with the most widely acknowledged corrosive organism being\nthe sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Several case studies on stainless and\ngalvanised steels have been reported [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] that SRB, SOB and iron\nreducing bacteria cultures initiated and progressed pitting, and caused intergranular\ncorrosion. Furthermore experimental investigations have [19, 20] have established\nthat sulphides, produced as a by-product of SRB activity, are responsible for enhanced\nabsorption of hydrogen into the steel (HE) resulting in higher corrosion fatigue crack\ngrowth rates.\n7II. Fatigue life\nDesigning for fatigue calls for an understanding of how the component behaves in a\nparticular stress mode. For example, the stress component could be loaded either in\nbending, tension\/compression, torsion, or a combination of all three. Therefore, when\nusing published data it is always prudent to establish the mode of loading for which\nthe fatigue data was obtained. Moreover, many fatigue tests are conducted on\nspecimens having a good surface finish, usually obtained by grinding or polishing.\nThe better the surface finish the higher the fatigue strength [21]. Codes of practice for\ncorrosion control are usually well documented by water companies. For example, steel\ncomponents exposed to water should, where possible, be hot-dipped galvanised.\nWhilst clearly it is important to prevent corrosion, regrettably the practice of\ngalvanising can however have an adverse effect on the fatigue strength of the\nsubstrate. The mechanism for failure is attributed a intermediate layer of diffused iron-\nzinc which may crack at stress levels less than the fatigue limit of the steel substrate,\nthus producing cracks which can penetrate directly into the steel substrate.\nDisappointingly there is not a great deal of published data predicting the loss of\nfatigue strength for zinc coated steel. However, even with such limited data, several\nresearches suggest a 30% reduction for hit-dipped galvanising and approximately 2%\nfor zinc electroplating [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. It has been reported that hot-dipped\nzinc coating decreases the fatigue limit of high strength steel by approximately 50%,\nhowever, this value is reduced for steel of lower tensile strength. Caution should be\nexercised when using these values, firstly because of the limited data available and\nsecondly these values were obtained for tests in dry air, which is not the environment\n8experienced by rotating biological contactors. However Forsman et.al [25] suggests\nhot-dip galvanising lowers the fatigue limit in air by approximately two-thirds of its\nvalue before coating, which remains unchanged when tested in water. This is in\ncontradiction to other published work, but none-the-less useful to know.\nIt is extremely difficult to predict the corrosive fatigue of metals when continuously\nexposed to settled sewage, this is because the chemical composition will vary from\nsite to site. Corrosion fatigue strength is defined as the resistance of a metal and its\nalloys to the formation and development of cracks, which lead to final fracture under\nthe effect of a corrosive environment. At best the designer can only assume the\naqueous environment to be fresh water, or at the very worst brackish water. For\nordinary unprotected structural steels subjected to fresh water, the reduction in fatigue\nstrength compared to dry air, was found by various researchers to be approximately\n70%. However, the results of some early work by Harvey [26], shows that hot-dipped\ngalvanising steel, having 0.47% carbon in the hardened and tempered condition, a\nreduction of 28% was observed. Protection of metal from attack by moisture through\nthe use of hot-dipped zinc galvanising may be advantageous from the point of view of\ncorrosion fatigue, until such time that a fatigue crack appears in the outer zinc coating.\nA further reason for concern regarding possible reduction in corrosion fatigue strength\nis the effect of low frequency applied stress. The lower the cycle frequency of the\napplied load, the lower the fatigue strength, based upon the same number of loading\ncycles. Unfortunately again there is little published data available which would assist\nwith the design of sewage treatment plant operating at approximately 0.018Hz,\nmoreover, fatigue strength depends on the type of corrosive agent. Most of the\n9published corrosion fatigue data has been based on tests carried out at loading\nfrequencies of 50Hz and over. At much lower loading frequencies, less than 3Hz,\nthere is a significant drop in the corrosion fatigue life. Several factors are responsible\nfor these phenomena, more significant is the early initiation of cracks [28, 29] and\nfaster crack propagation due to Hydrogen Embrittlement [30 to 39]. The widely held\nmechanism for this is that, at high loading frequencies, the electrolyte near the tip of\nthe crack is stirred and acidification at the tip is prevented. As a result the rate of\nhydrogen absorption and anodic dissolution decreases. Since the frequency of cyclic\nloading is high, the rate of movement of the triaxially stressed region is much greater\nthan that of hydrogen diffusion, therefore, a number of hydrogen atoms will fail to\nkeep pace with the triaxially stressed region. Under these conditions crack growth is\ngoverned by mechanical factors only. However, when the frequency of loading is low\nand the rate of movement of the triaxially stressed region is less than that of hydrogen\ndiffusion, a large number of hydrogen atoms can follow this zone and facilitate the\ninitiation of a mircocrack in the region of triaxial stresses ahead of the crack tip. The\ngrowth of the micro crack depends on the time within which hydrogen passes through\nthe zone of triaxial stresses. Other factors that contribute to the lower corrosion\nfatigue life include anodic dissolution, absorption strength reduction, induced wedge\neffect, loading waveform and microbiological influenced corrosion.\nGilikman [40] showed the effect of cycle frequency on the corrosion fatigue strength\nof nickel silicon steel, heat treated by quenching and tempering producing an ultimate\ntensile strength of 1760 MPa. Gilikman's results show the corrosion fatigue strength at\n1450rpm to be 250MPa which was lowered to 70MPa at 5rpm. Thereby giving a\nreduction in fatigue strength of approximately 70%. Gough [41] also carried out\n10\ncorrosive fatigue tests at different frequencies using salt-water and found a reduction\nof 65% in fatigue strength at the lower forcing frequencies. Whilst Endo et. al [42]\nshowed a reduction of 58% by reducing the load cycle frequency from 1000rpm to\n1rpm, their results were found to be dependant on the chemical composition and heat\ntreatment of the steel. The aqueous environment for these latter tests was tap-water.\nTests on stainless steel have also been undertaken by Masuda et.al. [43], they found a\nreduction of 33% by reducing the load frequency from 3Hz to 0.3Hz which was\nincreased to 50% by adjusting the load frequency from 3Hz to 0.03Hz.\nThe authors take the view that because the corrosive fatigue strength is influenced by\nthe chemical composition of the steel, in addition to probable heat treatment and the\nlikelihood that the steel has experienced previous cold working, then a guarded design\nstrategy would be to consider the cumulative effect of both hot-dip galvanising and\nthe influence of low frequency loading, accordingly the following is suggested. Given\nthat most steels the endurance fatigue limit is 50% of the ultimate tensile strength,\nalso considering that hot-dip galvanising reduces this value by approximately a further\n30% and low frequency loading an extra 50%, then the combined effect is 17.5% of\nthe ultimate tensile strength for rotating bending. For example, for a structural steel\nhaving an ultimate tensile strength of 450MPa the corrosive fatigue strength would be\n78.75 MPa. This value would need to be reduced even further if welded structures are\nemployed.\n11\nThe shaft-less RBC\nThere have been many reported instances, where the main supporting shaft of a RBC\nhas fractured across its diameter, resulting in complete collapse of the unit. Indeed\nshaft failure is by no means restricted to the larger RBC, but is associated with the\ncyclic stress levels operating within the shaft and the corrosion fatigue strength of the\nshaft material. However, it is the \u2018larger RBC\u2019 where cost savings are significant.\nConventional shaft design of an RBC, dictates that the bending stress caused by the\nbiomass loading, is the major influencing factor when selecting the size of the hollow\nshaft. In contrast, when designing a shaft-less RBC where successive media panel are\nclamped together using interconnecting beams, major stresses are caused by the shear\nforce loading, as opposed to bending couples. Disappointingly, when studying the\neffects of shear loading in steel frames, the method of finite element analysis is\nusually considered to be the most appropriate method of analysis. Such techniques are\nmore often than not unavailable to the smaller company. This paper address the\nproblem of frame stresses, by considering the application of \u2018guided\u2019 beam theory,\nwhereby, the media pack frames and the frame between packs are analysed using both\nbending and shear loading. As part of a feasibility study, the results for a typical 4.0\nmetre RBC is studied using guided beam theory and compared using finite element\nanalysis; see appendix A.\n1. Stress in a symmetrical elastic shaft subject to pure bending.\n12\nThe bending neutral axis for rotating shafts lies along the axis of rotation; moreover,\nthe axis of rotation must coincide with the centroid of the shaft if an unbalanced rotor\nis to be avoided. Mathematical expressions for calculating the second moment of area,\nsometimes referred to as bending inertia, for a hollow circular shaft are well\nestablished [44]. However, if the shaft no longer consists of a continuous hollow\nstructure, but is made up of a number of individual components equally positioned\nboth circumferentially and radially from the axis of rotation, then the second moment\nof area about a non-centroidal axis may be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia\nabout a parallel centroidal axis, known as the parallel axis theorem, which may be\ndescribed by the following equation:\n2\nXX X XI I AR\uf0a2 \uf0a2\uf03d \uf02b (1)\nIt must be emphasised that when applying the above stress calculation procedures to\nbending of beams, it is assumed that the affect of shear is negligible, which is not the\ncase when dealing with structures associated with rotating biological contactors due to\nelastic distortions [45].\nThe shaftless RBC unit consists of two end frames of the media pack connected to\neach other by a number of inter connecting beams. These interconnecting beams must\nbe capable of transmitting the combined bending and shear stress from media pack to\nadjacent packs, without the use of a hollow through shaft. Therefore, designs studies\nwhich only make use of the bending equation when calculating the bending stress in\nthe interconnecting beams, automatically neglect the influence of shear. Such\n13\ncalculations will inevitably result in underestimating the working stress level and may\neven lead to failure of the structure.\n2. Stress in a symmetrical elastic frame structure subject to combined\nbending and shear.\nIn order to examine more closely the influence of shear loading on the interconnecting\nbeams, it is helpful to consider the elastic behaviour of these longitudinal beams\nbetween end frames, as illustrated in figure 2. Here it is assumed that the biomass\nloading is reacted by the end frame of individual media packs, as indicated by the\nvariable \u2018F\u2019\nFigure 2 Schematic diagram illustrating local distortion of interconnecting\nbeams; F \u2013 Biomass loading\nThe loading from each media pack is shared equally by the interconnecting beams.\nMoreover, it is assumed that the longitudinal beams do not physically support the\nmedia segments, thereby allowing long-established design configurations for\nsupporting the media segments using conventional through rods to be exploited. A\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nShaft\nBearing\n14\ndecision made on commercial grounds, as it allows existing moulds to be used when\nmanufacturing the polymer media panels.\nConsider a single media pack where the two end frames are connected to each other\nby a number of interconnecting longitudinal beams. From observation of figure 2, it\ncan be seen that the slope is zero at the distal ends of the beam. However, whilst the\nslope at the ends is zero, the deflection does have a specific value. To study this affect\nfurther, consider a single beam built-in at the one end, whilst the opposite end is free\nto deflect but constrained from rotation. Employing the slope\/deflection method the\nresulting bending moment along the length of the beam is given by:-\nBMt = FL \/ (2N) (2)\nwhere 'F' is the total reactive load of the media pack\nacting on the end frame.\n'L' is the length of the media pack.\n'N' is the total number of interconnecting beams.\nIt perhaps interesting to note that using traditional bending stress procedures, the\nresulting maximum value occurs midway between the bearings. However, using\nequation (2) the maximum stress occurs at the end pack closest to the bearing. A\ncomparative application study is detailed in appendix A.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nIn analysing the mechanical integrity of an RBC or in creating a new design, it is\nnecessary to consider the cumulative effect of low frequency corrosion fatigue and\nmicrobiologically influenced corrosion. The fatigue strength of metals is reduced in a\n15\ncorrosive environment and reduced even further at low frequencies of loading. These\nfactors have the effect of removing any fatigue design limits, consequently, under\nthese circumstances every structural component will eventually fail. Furthermore,\ngalvanised and zinc-plated steels are also susceptible to low frequency corrosion\nfatigue. These mechanisms have resulted in mechanical failures of RBCs which, in\nsome instances, has resulted in operators failing to meet consent standards and\nhurriedly installing temporary treatment plants whilst the RBC is out of operation.\nAlthough all the necessary information on low frequency corrosion fatigue or the\ninfluence of MIC on structural steels members at low speeds of loading is not\navailable in the public domain, primarily because the research has not been\nundertaken, the design engineer is encouraged by the authors to observe trends in low\nfrequency corrosion fatigue data available. These trends will direct the engineer to the\nappropriate stress levels that can ensure an operational life of twenty years. Whilst\nthere is no proof to date on the effect of MIC on the structural members of RBC\u2019s, it\nis highly probable that the fatigue strength of structural members is reduced by this\nphenomenon. This is based on the evidence presented and the case studies reported,\nparticularly on the influence of hydrogen at low frequencies of loading.\nThe analytical technique proposed for modelling framed structures, for use on shaft-\nless RBC\u2019s has been shown to be reliable, giving results slightly higher than the more\naccurate finite element method, see appendix A. The simple feasibility model studied,\ncomprising of 12 continuous longitudinal box section beams 150mm x 150mm with\n8mm thickness, used to replace the hollow tubular shaft 610 diameter having 50mm\nwall, shows the framed structure to have a mass half that of the hollow shaft, thereby,\n16\ndemonstrating a significant cost reduction. Furthermore, suppliers of rectangular steel\nbox section should be more readily available, than suppliers of large hot rolled hollow\ntubing. Moreover, use of tubes structures should provide a greater opportunity for\nmodular design facilitating ease of media pack replacement.\nThe mechanical design of an RBC is not simply selecting the best material to perform\na particular function based on stress levels, but is more concerned with the corrosion\n(chemical and biological) and fatigue behaviour of the various materials chosen at low\nspeeds of loading. Failure to understand these requirements is probably why so many\nfailures have been experienced after the unit has been in operation only a few months\nor years of service. With a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of mechanical\nfailure, a new approach to RBC design will reduce the occurrence of mechanical\nfailure and ensure that effluent consent standards are maintained continuously.\nReferences\n1.

Therefore, the second\nmoment of area for the interconnecting beams is given by:-\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000\n0\n2\n4\n6\nLENGTH OF ROTOR (mm)\nB\nE\nN\nD\nIN\nG\nM\nO\nM\nE\nN\nT\n(k\ng.\nm\nx\nE\n5)\n4.531\n0\nBMt\n95000 Length\nFigure 5 Bending moment distribution along length of rotor\n2 2\nXXI AR 0.125AD N\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the interconnecting beam.\nD is the equivalent pitch circle diameter of the in\n\uf03d \uf03d\nterconnecting beams.\nN is the number of interconnecting beams.\n27\nHence the bending stress in the interconnecting beams, at the centre of the rotor, is\ncalculated as follows:-\n2 2 -4 2\nXX\n4\nXX\n5\nbending\nI AR 0.125AD N 0.125 45.1 10 4 8\nI 0.072 m\n4.531 10 2\n12.58 MPa.\n0.072\n\uf073\n\uf03d \uf03d \uf03d \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4 \uf0b4\n\uf05c \uf03d\n\uf0b4 \uf0b4\uf03d \uf03d\nFrom the above analysis it has to be concluded that the maximum bending stress in\nthe interconnecting beams, occurs in the media packs at the end of the rotor.\nTherefore, in order to vindicate the theoretical analysis, the same frame structure was\nalso analysed using finite elements. The results from this analysis identified the\nmaximum Von Mises stress point to be also located in the media packs, in the vicinity\nclose to the bearings, having a value of \uf0b1 70.4MPa compared to \uf0b1 76.92 MPa using\nthe hand tabulation technique. The reason for the slightly lower value was attributed\nto local distortion of the media end frame, thereby introducing a small slope at the\nends of the interconnecting beams. In other words, the beam was not exactly a guided\ncantilever.\n"}
