The aim of the\nproject was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing appropriate\nchanges to undergraduate and postgraduate entrepreneurship\nprogrammes.

E-mail: wlam@uclan.ac.uk.\nThe project discussed in this paper was designed to\nidentify good practice in government-funded initiatives\nand investigate how it might be incorporated into\nentrepreneurship education. As a result of the increasing\nrecognition of entrepreneurship as a key driver in\neconomic growth, the UK government has, since the\n1980s, sponsored a series of initiatives to boost\nentrepreneurship and to enhance the enterprise culture in\nthe UK. Although entrepreneurship education has as a\nconsequence grown substantially in universities and\ncolleges in the last two decades, it must be noted that\ngovernment-sponsored (directly or indirectly) initiatives\ntend to be operated on a limited-term basis and are\nrelatively expensive (some cost well over \u00a310,000 per\nbusiness start-up, taking into account the set-up and\nrunning costs during the short period of operation); and,\nINDUSTRY & HIGHER EDUCATION Vol 24, No 6, December 2010, pp 467\u2013473, doi: 10.5367\/ihe.2010.0013\nas such, it can be understood that longer-term impact\ntends to be limited. Apart from the self-reported success\nof these initiatives and some descriptive reports about\nkey success factors, little attention has been paid to good\npractice in context; and much less work has been done to\nexamine critically the feasibility of incorporating good\npractice into mainstream entrepreneurship education,\nwhich would offer a more sustainable mode of\nencouraging entrepreneurship. Funded by the Harris\nAward for Excellence in Research-Informed Teaching,\nthe project sought to identify realistic and feasible\ngood practice in a limited-term initiative called New\nEntrepreneur Scholarship (NES) and to incorporate it\ninto the mainstream undergraduate entrepreneurship\neducation curriculum, without compromising the quality\nof teaching and assessment of these programmes.\nThe aims and objectives of this project were:\n(1) to investigate the key factors that give rise to the\nsuccess of the New Entrepreneur Scholarship\nprogramme (NES);\n(2) to identify NES good practice related to pedagogical\ndevelopment; and\n(3) to examine critically the feasibility of applying good\npractice in the undergraduate curriculum.\nThe aims were consistent with the University of\nCentral Lancashire\u2019s strategic vision of embracing\n\u2018employability and enterprise\u2019 in its curriculum design,\ndelivery and assessment. The project was intended\nto contribute to the pedagogical development of\nentrepreneurship education in mainstream undergraduate\nand postgraduate programmes. This might include, for\nexample, transfer of the approaches used by NES to\ninculcate personal attitudes, motivation and risk-taking\nas well as developing sustainable entrepreneurial\ncapabilities appropriate for a graduate\u2019s future\nemployment. Overall, the goal was to enhance the\nenterprise skills and employability, in the private and\npublic sectors, of the students.\nIn the following section, we will briefly cover the\nhistory of the NES. The paper then continues by\nexamining the project design and research approach.\nFindings are then presented and discussed before\nconcluding the paper with implications for research,\neducation and policy makers.\nThe NES programme\nThe NES programme was launched in 2001 as one\nof the UK government\u2019s nation-wide initiatives for\naddressing the role of HEIs and enterprise agencies\nin promoting the UK\u2019s entrepreneurial activities in\ndisadvantaged areas. The programme was funded by the\nLearning and Skills Council1 and managed jointly by\nthe National Federation of Enterprise Agencies (NFEA),\nthe Association of Business Schools (ABS) and the\nPrince\u2019s Trust, and was designed to overcome the\ndifficulties associated with such disadvantaged areas\nby providing a comprehensive package of support,\nmentoring and funding in order to encourage and sustain\nthe start-up and growth of new businesses.\nThe programme aimed to turn viable business ideas\ninto sustainable business. It consisted of three main\nelements: a start-up personal and business development\nprogramme, financial support and ongoing mentoring.\nInterested potential applicants were required to have a\nbusiness idea when applying for the NES programme\nsupport: the ideas were screened and applicants were\ninterviewed by the NES practitioners. Since this was a\nprogramme for individuals from disadvantaged areas,\nthe key criterion to be met, with regard to an offer being\nmade, was \u2013 according to the NES staff \u2013 the postcode\n(that is, the domestic location) of the applicant. Once\naccepted, applicants then attended an evening course\nheld once a week for three months and covering\ndifferent aspects of business start-up, with the\nparticipants being expected to use their own business\nidea for the course exercise. Once the participants had\ncompleted the three-month course, they received a\nuniversity certificate and were encouraged to start their\nbusiness: if they decided to do so during or after the\ncourse, they received financial support of \u00a31,500\ntowards their start-up costs.\nSince its launch in 2001, NES has been highly\nsuccessful, with a high course-completion rate (88%), a\nhigh start-up rate (better than 95%) and high survival\nrates. NES graduates have an above-average business\nsurvival rate of 85% after 5 years of trading, the\naverage for all start-ups being less than 40% (Barclays,\n2007). The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN)\nis one of the founding partners of the NES and has\nachieved above-average results in terms of the number\nof business start-ups it has generated and the regional\nand national awards won by graduates. However,\ndespite the impressive track record of NES in terms of\nencouraging and supporting entrepreneurial activities,\nlittle work has been done to incorporate NES good\npractice into a pedagogical paradigm that might be\nshared more widely. Interestingly, during the fieldwork\nperiod of the present research it was confirmed that\nthe NES programme was to be terminated with\nimmediate effect \u2013 another illustration of the many\nuncertainties of government-supported initiatives. The\nannouncement of termination of the NES programme\nmade this present project even more meaningful, simply\nbecause the data would no longer be available for\ninvestigation and analysis once the programme had\nclosed.2\nStudent engagement in entrepreneurial learning\nINDUSTRY & HIGHER EDUCATION December 2010468\nApproach and research plan\nA multi-stage fieldwork research plan was considered\nessential for achieving the research aims and objectives.\nThe project design is illustrated in Figure 1 and the\nresearch action plan is presented in Table 1: 134\nindividuals, including 10 former NES participants, 12\ntutors and practitioners and 112 undergraduate students,\nparticipated in the fieldwork. In the following sections,\nthe findings of the research project at different stages are\ndiscussed.\nFirst stage fieldwork: findings\nThe first stage of the fieldwork consisted of in-depth,\nface-to-face interviews with NES graduates, with\nthe key objective of allowing them to share their\nexperiences of the NES programme. The second part\nof the fieldwork during this stage comprised in-depth\ndiscussions with NES practitioners, providing them with\nopportunities to share their views and to talk about the\nissues NES participants had encountered. Several key\ntopics were identified at this stage of the fieldwork:\nthese will now be discussed.\nPractitioner work experience and knowledge\nOne of the key areas that was repeatedly emphasized\nboth by NES graduates and tutors was the experience\nand knowledge of the NES tutors. All of the NES tutors\nat UCLAN have had experience as business owners,\nconsultants, or in accountancy practices. According to\nthe NES graduates, the fact that their tutors \u2018know what\nthey are talking about\u2019 is something that increased the\nlevels of confidence of the graduates with regard to their\nstudies and future business prospects. Because of the\nway the workshop was run, graduates had plenty of\nopportunities to talk to their tutors about the problems\nthey encountered with their business plan; and the fact\nthat the tutors were knowledgeable helped participants\nto solve many of their problems. The tutors also acted as\nmentors and this provided different opportunities for\nseeking advice on business start-ups.\nNetworking opportunities\nMost of the NES graduates we talked to appreciated the\nnetworking opportunities that the NES provided.

In addition, networking provided\nmarketing opportunities: some of the participants\nreceived their first business order from fellow\nparticipants. The NES also provided opportunities for\nparticipants to meet previous NES graduates, many\nof whom were business owners; and there were\nopportunities to meet other relevant people such\nas accountants, bankers, lawyers or marketing\nprofessionals. According to the NES graduates, all of\nthis was very important in helping to get businesses\nstarted.\nMarketing\nOne of the key areas in the NES programme, repeatedly\nemphasized as such by both NES graduates and tutors,\nwas knowledge of the market and marketing. The NES\nprogramme devoted a significant number of sessions on\nareas such as market demand, market research and sales\ntechniques. The graduates benefited significantly from\nthese practitioner-oriented sessions: the knowledge\ncovered helped them to understand how the market\noperates, the importance of market research in order to\nunderstand market demand and how to approach\ncustomers to generate sales.\nAccounting and finance\nAnother key area that was highlighted by both the NES\ngraduates and tutors was knowledge of accounting and\nfinance. The NES tutors considered it important that\ntheir graduates should have a sound understanding of\naccounting and finance, these subjects playing a major\nrole in the start-up and subsequent survival of any new\nbusiness, something clearly understood by the NES\ngraduates. Many of them had joined NES without any\nprior knowledge of topics such as cash flow, budgeting,\ncosting or book-keeping, and the knowledge gained\nfrom the NES programme helped them to understand\nbetter their own financial situation and to make\ninformed decisions about business start-ups. As a\nby-product, some graduates also found the knowledge\nuseful in other aspects of their life \u2013 for example, with\ndomestic finances and in family businesses.\nStage one analysis and good practice\nAs a result of the stage one fieldwork and analysis,\nseveral clear examples of good practice were identified\nand these were critically examined by researchers, tutors\nand module leaders. As a result, some changes were\nsuggested which were implemented in the\nundergraduate entrepreneurship programme.\n(1) To suggest to students that they should think of a\nbusiness idea at the beginning of the course and use\nthis business idea to apply the new knowledge they\nlearn during the course.\n(2) To invite experienced NES tutors to be guest\nlecturers on the course, to take advantage of their\nexperience and knowledge.\n(3) To include marketing and accounting for small\nbusinesses in the course content.\n(4) To introduce students to the university business\nenterprise network and facilities, including a tour of\nthe business incubator and Northern Light project (a\nuniversity-based enterprise and business support\nprogramme).\n(5) To invite entrepreneurs to be guest speakers, to share\ntheir experience of business start-ups.\nComparing NES participants and\nundergraduate students\nFollowing the introduction of these changes in the first\nsemester, post-implementation focus groups were held\nwith tutors, course leaders, module leaders and students.\nAs a result, some further issues were identified that\nneeded to be addressed.\nInitial business idea\nThe NES participants were required to have an initial\nbusiness idea when they joined the NES programme: the\nundergraduate students were not. Thus, at the beginning\nof the semester, it was suggested to students that they\nshould think of a business idea and apply to it the new\nknowledge that they gained during the course. The\nrationale was that knowledge covered in the course\nneeds to be applied in a business enterprise context.\nWhilst the NES participants actively engaged in\napplying knowledge to refine their business ideas during\nthe NES programme, the undergraduate students were\nnot very enthusiastic about it: in fact, many of them\nnever used their business ideas during their studies. The\ntutors were given the impression that the students were\nnot taking the matter seriously and tended to suggest\nbusinesses such as corner shops, pubs or fast-food\nrestaurants \u2013 that is, businesses they thought of on the\nspur of the moment, when asked by the tutor, rather\nthan having considered genuine possibilities. Because\nthey did not seem to give much thought to their business\nideas, the students did not apply the knowledge\ncovered in the sessions. Why this occurred is a matter\nfor speculation at this stage: it may be that, as\nundergraduate students, they could not see how business\nStudent engagement in entrepreneurial learning\nINDUSTRY & HIGHER EDUCATION December 2010470\nenterprise related to them \u2013 even though they had\nchosen to take a module or course about\nentrepreneurship.\nMarketing and accounting\nThe course content emphasized subjects related to core\nfunctions such as marketing and accounting. This\nincludes topics such as the marketing mix, market\nresearch, selling techniques, pricing, book-keeping and\naccounting, costing and cash flow management. Both\nNES participants and undergraduate students liked the\nway the sessions were delivered and said that it helped\nthem to enhance their knowledge of these subjects by\nplacing them in the wider context of real business\npractice. In short, it helped them to appreciate the\nimportance of these subjects and how this related to\nthe process of starting a business. However, the\ntutors expressed some concerns: they felt that the\nundergraduate students might not be able to retain\nenough of what they learned in the sessions if they\ndid not have an early opportunity to use this new\nknowledge; and the fact they were undergraduate\nstudents would mean that such opportunities might not\narise for several years. Somewhat ironically, the tutors\nalso felt that one of the reasons that these subjects were\nwell-received by students might have been the manner\nin which the sessions were delivered: a more\n\u2018traditional\u2019 teaching mode was used \u2013 which some\nmight describe as \u2018spoon-feeding\u2019.\nNetworking opportunities\nAt the beginning of the semester, a visit to the\nuniversity incubation centre was organized by the\ncourse leader. The incubation centre offers dedicated\naccommodation, used by new businesses, and an open\narea where facilities such as Internet access, printers,\nfaxes, meeting areas and separate, general meeting\nrooms are available. The tour thus enabled students to\nfind out about the facilities and it provided opportunities\nfor networking and seeking advice from entrepreneurs\nand advisors. The tour was apparently well-received by\nthe students who said they \u2018liked what they saw\u2019 and\nwould consider using the incubator facilities: however,\nafter the first semester none of the students had actually\nused any of the incubator\u2019s facilities or indeed visited it\nagain \u2013 even though it is on campus and thus within\neasy reach.\nDuring the semester the module leaders also\nintroduced several on-campus seminars, with guest\nspeakers, on topics related to business start-ups. Whilst\nthese networking opportunities were liked by NES\nparticipants, the undergraduate students did not seem as\nenthusiastic \u2013 none of the students who participated in\nthe focus group had actually attended any of the\nseminars or networking events, in fact.\nDrive, motivation and participation\nBoth practitioners and graduates agreed that having a\ncombination of drive and motivation is the key success\nfactor of the NES programme and this is supported in\nthe literature (Naffziger et al, 1994; Watson and\nHogarth-Scott, 1998; Baum and Locke, 2004; Wilson\net al, 2004). Significant differences were identified\namongst the NES graduates and undergraduate students.\nAs previously noted, it was a condition of the\nprogramme that all NES participants had to be from\ndisadvantaged areas. Many of them had worked but\nwere unemployed and were referred to NES by Job\nCentres (locally-based, government-funded employment\nagencies) and, because of this, these individuals\ngenerally had an urgent need to earn a living: starting\na business was presented to them as an opportunity to\ndo so. They therefore had a stronger drive, and the\nmotivation, to learn how to start a business successfully.\nThe university students, on the other hand, had little\nwork experience: they were, generally, much younger\nand had not thought about their career or earning a\nliving. This difference in circumstances and attitudes\nwas clearly demonstrated in class participation: while\nthe NES participants were very keen to engage in\nclass discussions and exercises, a significant number\nof the undergraduates were reluctant to do so, rarely\nraising questions or participating in group discussions.\nAccording to the NES tutors, it may be that\nundergraduate students simply do not know what\nquestions to ask with regard to business start-ups,\nhaving \u2013 unlike their NES graduate counterparts \u2013 not\nbeen involved in entrepreneurial activities. However, a\nmajor part of the class discussion was concerned with\nwhat had just been covered in the session, and so the\nsubject matter was by no means a totally unknown area\nfor the undergraduates. It is therefore reasonable to infer\nthat the undergraduates lacked the drive or motivation to\nlearn about entrepreneurship, in contrast to their NES\ncounterparts. Another possibility is that undergraduate\nstudents were used to being passive \u2018learners\u2019 rather\nthan active participants in the interactive sessions: this is\nan issue that needs to be addressed if students are to\ntake advantage of the sessions.\nConclusions and suggestions\nThis project aimed to identify and incorporate good\npractice from government-funded initiatives into\nuniversity entrepreneurship education. By adopting a\nmulti-stage research approach, some cases of good\npractice were identified in the stage one fieldwork and\nStudent engagement in entrepreneurial learning\nINDUSTRY & HIGHER EDUCATION December 2010 471\nthen critically examined to assess the feasibility of\nincorporating them into undergraduate programmes. As\na result, changes were implemented and subsequently\nevaluated. The results of our analysis showed that there\nare certain differences between NES participants and\nundergraduate students that affect the feasibility and\neffectiveness of incorporating suggested good practice.\nOne of the key factors is the students\u2019 lack of drive and\nmotivation, which influences their level of course\nparticipation and hence affects their learning experience.\nAnother key factor is students\u2019 expectations about\nentrepreneurship education. Many of them expected to\nbe \u2018taught\u2019 and were reluctant to engage actively in the\ncourse, because they were unable to understand how it\nmight be useful and relevant to their studies. The critical\nissue is that entrepreneurship cannot be taught, but it\ncan be learned; and this involves constant input from\nstudents and requires their participation in class\nexercises. The students\u2019 lack of enthusiasm resulted in\ntheir failing to take advantage of both the tutors\u2019\nknowledge and experience and the networking\nopportunities or facilities offered by the university.\nLearning from the NES?\nThe results of our findings might be regarded as\ndiscouraging. The findings suggest that the NES was\nsuccessful in particular contexts and is therefore difficult\nto replicate in mainstream entrepreneurship education \u2013\nthat is, to be operated in a more inclusive, cost-effective\nand therefore sustainable context. Nevertheless, it is\nargued that this project makes a particular contribution\nin helping to advance understanding of entrepreneurship\neducation from a different perspective. One of the key\nissues that arose was the students\u2019 lack of enthusiasm\nabout entrepreneurship and this may be due to the fact\nthat they were unable see how this knowledge could be\nuseful or relevant to them. For the undergraduates,\ngraduation was still a long way away and not something\nthey needed to worry about. This attitude affected the\ndegree of engagement of the students and thus the\neffectiveness and efficiency of their learning, something\nfor the policy makers and educators to contemplate and\naddress. For the policy makers, there is an urgent and\nconstant need to promote and support an enterprise\nculture: in the absence of such a positive enterprise\nculture, it is difficult for students to understand and\nappreciate the value of learning how to be\nentrepreneurial. It is equally important for students to\nbe informed about the importance of improving their\nemployability and enterprise skills during their\nundergraduate studies. It might be argued that this is\nmore difficult to achieve in a society with relatively\ngood welfare benefits; but the example of the NES\ngraduates suggests otherwise. The difference lies,\nperhaps, in understanding the real world rather than\ncampus life. Students should be encouraged to\nparticipate in placements or part-time jobs which would\nhelp them to gain a better appreciation of the demands\nof the \u2018real\u2019 business world. Equally, it might be helpful\nfor universities to invite successful entrepreneurs to be\nguest speakers on campus \u2013 although, as our findings\nsuggest, the students\u2019 lack of understanding of the\nrealities of business largely undermined the value of\nusing entrepreneurs in this way.\nSome suggestions for mainstream entrepreneurship\neducation can be made.\n(1) More attention should be paid to helping students\nto realize the importance of enterprise and\nemployability and the need to acquire this\nunderstanding during their undergraduate studies.\nThis is particularly important during the current\neconomic downturn as job opportunities with\nemployer organizations diminish and university\nstudents become more likely to face unemployment\nafter they graduate.\n(2) Tutors could ask the students to think of a business\nidea at the beginning of the course and then require\nthem to present their business idea to the class, as\npart of students\u2019 assessments. Including it as an\nelement of assessment might make it more likely\nthat the students would take it more seriously.\n(3) Using the initial business idea, the students would be\nrequired to work on it during their undergraduate\nstudies: as such, the business idea becomes not\nmerely part of coursework for a module, but an\nongoing project throughout their undergraduate\nstudies.\n(4) Subjects such as marketing, accounting and finance\nto be made mandatory for entrepreneurship students.\nThese subjects represent foundation knowledge: they\nmust be presented in a way that makes them relevant\nto small business start-ups.\n(5) It is important that tutors having substantial\nknowledge and experience in entrepreneurship\ngenerally or specialist areas such as accounting or\nmarketing are recruited so that they can act both as\ntutors and mentors.\nReflection, limitations and future research\nOn reflection, the findings of this project helped to\nhighlight an issue that had been overlooked by the\nauthor. The project was designed to locate \u2018good\npractice\u2019, with the premise that there are relevant factors\nthat can be clearly identified, isolated and implemented.\nWhat was found is that \u2018good practice\u2019 can only be\nfeasible in specific social contexts which are embedded\nStudent engagement in entrepreneurial learning\nINDUSTRY & HIGHER EDUCATION December 2010472\nin a complex web of factors including the learners\u2019\ndrive and motivation, employment status and attitude\ntowards entrepreneurship. Without such a supporting\ncontext it is unlikely that good practice can be fully\neffective in promoting and enhancing entrepreneurship.\nBecause of this, it is argued that a broader theoretical\nframework that incorporates this complex web of factors\nis required, to investigate entrepreneurship education as\nan ongoing social process. It is argued further that a\nmore in-depth, longitudinal study of entrepreneurship\neducation would be helpful in shedding new light on\nthis complicated process.\nAlthough the multi-stage fieldwork adopted within\nthis project was aimed at identifying, implementing and\nevaluating good practice from a government-funded\ninitiative, in order to incorporate this into mainstream\nentrepreneurship education, the analysis is based on\nfieldwork material collected from only one UK\nuniversity and one government-funded initiative (itself\nnow abandoned). Despite the quantity and quality of the\ndata that were collected, a limitation of this study is that\nit employed a relatively small sample size and had very\nlimited coverage. Future research should attempt to\nincrease the sample size in order to evaluate critically\nthe feasibility and effectiveness of good practice as\nsuggested above. Furthermore, it is expected that\nnational, or trans-national, large-scale studies will have\nthe potential to yield more insightful findings, to\ncontribute to the debate on entrepreneurship in higher\neducation.\nNotes\n1The Learning and Skills Council, established by central\ngovernment in 2001, was abolished in March 2009.\nResponsibility for its principle functions has been transferred\nto two successor organizations, the Skills Funding Agency\n(http:\/\/skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk\/) and the Young People\u2019s\nLearning Agency (http:\/\/www.ypla.gov.uk\/).\n2Central government funding for NES came to an end in 2008,\nat which time the programme was terminated.\nReferences\nBarclays (2007), Small Firms in Britain, 2007, Barclays Bank\nPLC.\nBaum, J.R., and Locke, E.A.
