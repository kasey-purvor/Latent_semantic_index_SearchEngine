Psychiatric illness and mortality after hip \nfracture. Lancet. 2001; 357: 1264-5.  \nSummary \nPeople with dementia or delirium have increased mortality in the 6 months after hip \nfracture, but depression might take longer to have an effect. We assessed the \npsychiatric status of 731 participants with hip fracture and analysed the effect of \npsychiatric illness on mortality during the next 2 years. We found that dementia, \ndelirium, and depression all increased the risk of mortality (p<0\u00b70001, p<0\u00b70001, and \np=0\u00b70359, respectively), and that mortality differed significantly between hospitals \n(p=0\u00b70003). We suggest that psychiatric interventions should be assessed in hip-\nfracture patients with adequate follow up of outcome measures. \nText \nHip fracture is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults [1]. Psychiatric \nillness is thought to worsen prognosis of patients with hip fractures, although we \nquestioned the evidence for this assertion in a recent systematic review [2]. We noted \nthat small sample sizes had led to imprecise findings, dementia and delirium had not \nbeen distinguished, and that analysis was based on only one psychiatric diagnosis. We \nhave shown that survival at 6 months after hip fracture is adversely affected by \ndementia (hazard ratio 2\u00b757 [95% CI 1\u00b765\u20134\u00b701]) and delirium (2\u00b788 [1\u00b776\u20134\u00b772]), but not \nby depression (1\u00b701 [0\u00b753\u20131\u00b794]) [3]. However, more than 6 months of follow up might \nbe needed to detect the effect of depression [4]. We did a 2-year follow up of the cohort \nfrom our previous study to establish whether depression affects long-term survival after \nhip fracture. \nAll patients aged 65 years or older, admitted to two teaching hospitals (A and B) in the \nsame city, and having hip-fracture operations during a 19-month period, were eligible for \ninclusion [3]. Neither hospital had a dedicated hip-fracture service; one hospital had \nweekly visits from a consultant geriatrician, whereas the other had no formal \northogeriatric collaboration. Psychiatric input in each hospital was by consultation. \nPsychiatric status was assessed by use of Geriatric Mental State\/AGECAT software \n(community version 3a). Cognitive impairment was diagnosed with this software or by \nthe standardised mini-mental state examination, and was classed as dementia, delirium, \nor both, with the delirium rating scale. If patients had depression and cognitive \nimpairment, impairment was given diagnostic precedence. We recorded: age; sex; \nconcurrent physical illness (by the Burvill scale); type of fracture; type of operation \nanaesthetic; hospital; and prefracture daily activities (using the Barthel score), \nsocioeconomic status, accommodation, and support network. \nA researcher, unaware of the initial diagnosis, assessed survival at 2 years from time of \nadmission by asking general practitioners and by searching a local health-service \ndatabase. Data were analysed with a multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model by \nstepwise variable selection and analysis of interactions between variables; significant \nvariables were retained (p<0\u00b705). Assumption of constant proportionality over time of \nvariables in the final model was validated. We obtained ethical approval. \n903 patients met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 172 (19%) were excluded: 78 (9%) \nrefused consent, 41 (5%) were too physically ill to be interviewed, 19 (2%) were too \ndeaf to interview, 14 (2%) died before interview, ten (1%) did not have surgery, eight \nhad dysphasia, one spoke no English, and one was transferred to another hospital. \nHence, our sample size was 731 patients. Of these patients: 208 (28%) were \npsychiatrically well, 294 (40%) had dementia, 108 (15%) had delirium, and 93 (13%) \nhad depression. 66 patients with depression had not been prescribed antidepressants, \nwhich suggested that they either had newonset depression or had not previously been \ndiagnosed. 28 people (4%) were diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders (alcohol \nmisuse, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and phobias), which we did not include in our \nanalysis. \nTwo years after admission 347 (47%) included patients had died, 384 (53%) remained \nalive, and none were lost to follow up. The Figure shows unadjusted survival of patients \nstratified by psychiatric diagnosis soon after hip fracture.  \nFigure.

Risk of mortality was \ngreater in one hospital than the other, even after controlling for confounding variables \nsuch as sociodemographic status. \nTable: Multivariate survival analysis of hazard ratios for  \nmortality 2 years after hip fracture in 731 elderly patients \n Mortality \nVariable Unit Hazard \nratio \np 95% CI \nAge \n \nYears 1\u00b7024 .005 1\u00b7007 to 1\u00b7040 \nSex \nvs. Female \nMale 1\u00b7653 .0003 1\u00b7255 to 2\u00b7176 \nAdmitting hospital \nvs. Hospital A \nHospital B 1\u00b7494 .0003 1\u00b7204 to 1\u00b7855 \nActivities of Daily Living \n \nADL Units 0\u00b7976 .0438 0\u00b7952 to 0.999 \nPhysical illness \nvs. none \nOverall  <.0001  \nMild 1\u00b7377 .0541 0\u00b7994 to 1\u00b7906 \nModerate 2\u00b7000 <.0001 1\u00b7445 to 2\u00b7768 \nSevere 2\u00b7928 <.0001 1\u00b7764 to 4\u00b7861 \nPsychiatric diagnosis \nvs. well \nOverall  <.0001  \nDementia 2\u00b7620 <.0001 1\u00b7883 to 3\u00b7645 \nDelirium 2\u00b7404 <.0001 1\u00b7659 to 3\u00b7484 \nDepression 1\u00b7566 .0359 1\u00b7030 to 2\u00b7381 \n \nObservational studies can be biased. Nevertheless, we have shown a substantial effect \nof psychiatric illness, especially dementia and delirium, on postoperative survival, which \nis unlikely to be totally attributable to confounding factors. Our findings have three \nimplications. First, psychiatric illness is common in older people admitted to hospital \nwith hip fracture, and its adverse effect justifies development of psychiatric or \npsychosocial interventions to complement physical rehabilitation in orthogeriatric care \nmodels. We found only one trial of a psychosocial intervention in geriatric people. \nParticipants in this trial were screened for psychiatric illness and, if such illness were \nfound, were randomly assigned psychosocial assessment and care package, or \ntreatment as usual.5 Length of hospital stay and costs were reduced, but the \nintervention was not clearly described; hence general conclusions cannot be drawn. \nSecond, prospective studies of depression in physical illness must be followed up for \nsufficient time, or important effects might be missed.1 Third, differences in outcomes \nbetween hospitals might be caused by variations in the total package of care.1 Thus, \nmortality rates after hip fracture were well chosen by the National Health Service \nexecutive as good clinical-performance indicators. Knowledge of variation in outcomes \ncaused by service factors should aid evaluation, planning, and redesign of health-care \nservices for older adults. \nWe thank Alison Torn for help with recruiting and interviewing participants.
