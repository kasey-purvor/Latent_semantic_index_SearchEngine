This article examines the distinctiveness of transnational accountability in \nrelation to: (1) its general meaning and specific forms; (2) its aims and importance; (3) \nits empirical existence and the relative frequency of its forms; (4) its causes; and (5) its \neffects. The article cautiously concludes that on most of these dimensions the \nsimilarities outweigh the differences and that it would be unfruitful for research on \ntransnational accountability to develop separately from that on domestic accountability. \n \n \n \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nFew fallacies are frowned upon by International Relations (IR) scholars more than those \nrelated to na\u00efve applications of the so-called \u201cdomestic analogy\u201d. In Hidemi Suganami\u2019s \nclassic definition, the domestic analogy consists of \u201cpresumptive reasoning [\u2026] about \ninternational relations based on the assumption that since domestic and international \nphenomena are similar in a number of respects, a given proposition which holds true \ndomestically, but whose validity is as yet uncertain internationally, will also hold true \ninternationally\u201d (Suganami 1989: 24). In recent years, an increasing number of scholars \nhave used the concept of \u201caccountability\u201d to describe and assess relationships among \nactors who are primarily based in different state jurisdictions, or involving actors \ntranscending state jurisdictions \u2013 in short, transnational relations.1 To what extent does \nthis trend reflect an unwarranted application of the domestic analogy? Is the conceptual \nbaggage associated to the term \u201caccountability\u201d unsuitable for travelling beyond state \nborders?  \n In a sense, those questions appear futile, since the language of accountability is \nunlikely to disappear from debates about transnational relations. A more fruitful way of \naddressing the sceptics\u2019 concerns is to ask whether there is something inherently \ndistinctive about accountability in transnational spaces. If there is, this would provide at \nleast a strong case for inverting the domestic analogy and for presuming that any given \nproposition about accountability which holds true domestically will probably not hold \ntrue internationally. Analyses of domestic and transnational accountability may then \nprogress more satisfactorily if they proceed on separate tracks. To be sure, \ndistinctiveness can occur at various levels and concern different dimensions of the \nconcept. In this paper, the distinctiveness of transnational accountability is examined in \n                                                 \n1 A small selection: Held 1995; Woods 2001; Keohane and Nye 2003; Clark et al. 2003; Scholte \n2005; Grant and Keohane 2005; Kahler 2005; Slaughter 2005; Macdonald and Macdonald 2006; \nZweifel 2006; Risse 2006; Ebrahim and Weisband 2007; Newell 2008. To be sure, in the IR \nliterature accountability is still much less used than other concepts, such as hegemony, \nbalancing, bargaining, signalling, norm diffusion, epistemic communities, or two-level games. \nIn article \u201ctransnational relations\u201d is used in the broadest sense and includes intergovernmental \ninstitutions.  \n 3 \nrelation to (1) its general meaning and specific forms; (2) its aims and importance; (3) \nits empirical existence and the relative frequency of its forms; (4) its causes; and (5) its \neffects. Each of these dimensions or levels is examined in a separate section of this \npaper. The paper cautiously concludes that on most of these dimensions the similarities \noutweigh the differences and that it would be unfruitful for research on transnational \naccountability to develop separately from that on domestic accountability. \n \n \n1. Conceptualization \n \nStudies on the nature and significance of accountability often start by lamenting the \nfuzziness and manipulability of the concept. However, accountability can be used as an \nanalytical lens that may help observers capture certain relationships of communication \nand power better than other analytical concepts. In other words, conceptualizing a \ncluster of interactions as an accountability relationship may illuminate, rather than \nobfuscate, their core features, dynamics and implications.  \n The potential contribution of the concept of accountability has been enhanced by a \nnumber of generally compatible attempts at defining accountability in an analytically \nuseful way. For instance, Allen Buchanan and Robert Keohane identify three core \nelements of accountability: \u201cfirst, standards that those who are held accountable are \nexpected to meet; second, information available to accountability holders, who can then \napply the standards in question to the performance of those who are held to account; and \nthird, the ability of these accountability holders to impose sanctions\u2014to attach costs to \nthe failure to meet the standards.\u201d (Buchanan and Keohane 2006). Mark Bovens writes \nthat \u201c[a]ccountability is a relationship between an actor and a forum, in which the actor \nhas an obligation to explain and to justify his or her conduct, the forum can pose \nquestions and pass judgement, and the actor may face consequences.\u201d (Bovens 2007: \n450, emphasis removed). \n The fact that similar definitions of accountability are developed in the literatures on \npublic administration (e.g. Bovens 2007), democratization studies (e.g. Schedler 1999) \nand international relations (e.g. Grant and Keohane 2005) is a strong indication that its \ncore meaning is not dependent on assumptions about the political context defined \n 4 \nsimply in terms of the presence or absence of statehood. This also suggests that any \ndifferences between within-state and transnational manifestations of accountability are \nnot located at the highest level of conceptual abstraction. This opens the way for \nmeaningful comparisons between levels without an immediate danger of conceptual \nstretching.   \n There is also a relatively high level of agreement at a lower level of conceptual \nabstraction, namely with respect to the identification and classification of different \nforms or types of accountability mechanisms. For instance, in the field of public \nadministration Romzek and Dubnick (1987) identified \u201cbureaucratic\u201d, \u201clegal\u201d, \n\u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d accountability, while Dwivedi and Jabbra (1989) \ndistinguished among \u201cadministrative\u201d, \u201clegal\u201d, \u201cpolitical\u201d, \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cmoral\u201d \naccountability. Analysing accountability from an IR perspective, Grant and Keohane \n(2005) list seven mechanisms of accountability: \u201chierarchical\u201d, \u201csupervisory\u201d, \u201cfiscal\u201d, \n\u201clegal\u201d, \u201cmarket\u201d, \u201cpeer\u201d and \u201cpublic reputational\u201d. The substantial overlap between \nthese and other typologies is a further indication of significant similarities across \ndomains.  \n To be sure, typologies do not coincide perfectly. For instance, Grant and Keohane \n(2005) include the market as a mechanism for accountability, while the market is not \none of forums of accountability listed by Bovens (which are political, legal, \nadministrative, professional, and social \u2013 but he specifies that the list is not exhaustive). \nThis attention to market accountability \u2013 that is, to consumers, buyers and investors \u2013 \nmay be due to the importance that market-based power relationships have in a political \ndomain that lacks overarching stateness. There is also some conceptual ambiguity in the \nrelationship between \u201cpolitical\u201d, \u201celectoral\u201d and \u201cdemocratic\u201d accountability. For \nBovens, elections are only one, albeit seemingly necessary, component of political \naccountability. Schmitter (2004) defines political accountability in a broader way in \nwhich elections are not a necessary aspect \u2013 indeed any accountability relationship \nbetween rulers and citizens qualifies. Grant and Keohane (2005) exclude electoral \naccountability from their list of accountability mechanisms because it is \u201cnot relevant to \ncontemporary global institutions\u201d. This exclusion rests on the argument that there is no \nglobal public that could function as forum for global democratic accountability. But this \namounts to throwing out the electoral baby with the democratic bathwater. Electoral \n 5 \nmechanisms of accountability are not necessarily democratic, in the sense of aiming for \npolitical equality among those who are affected by the outcome of an election. Member \nstates that vote for candidates to become heads of international organizations, \nindividuals who vote for executive officers of non-governmental organizations, or \nshareholders who vote for members of company boards exercise a form of electoral \naccountability that is not necessarily democratic.  \n Two conceptual distinctions are arguably important in relation to the distinctiveness \nof transnational accountability. Grant and Keohane (2005) suggest that there are two \n\u201cbasic models\u201d of accountability, which provide fundamentally different answers to the \nquestion: \u201cwho is entitled to hold the powerful accountable?\u201d \u201cIn the participation \nmodel, the performance of power-wielders is evaluated by those who are affected by \ntheir actions. In the delegation model, by contrast, performance is evaluated by those \nentrusting them with powers.\u201d (2005: 31) The distinction is said to be crucial not least \nbecause the two basic models mandate different strategies and mechanisms for \naccountability. Four of the seven mechanisms they identify (hierarchical, supervisory, \nfiscal, and legal accountability) rely heavily on delegation, while three (market, peer, \nand reputational accountability) involve forms of participation.  The distinction between \ndelegation and participation is useful, but not without problems. Consider a claim for \naccountability based on the support that an actor gives to another, for instance by \nproviding the resources that the latter needs to be perform a task (e.g. individuals \nmaking a donation to a disaster relief agency). To the extent that the supporting actor \ndemands accountability from the supported actor, this demand may be based neither on \nan authorization to act (e.g., the relief agency may have obtained that from other \nsources) nor on the mere claim that the supporter is \u201caffected\u201d by the performance of \nthe supported actor. Support fits uneasily in the delegation-participation framework \n(Keohane 2003). Another difficulty of the framework is that legal accountability is not \nusually based on delegation, as are many forms of \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cdiagonal\u201d \naccountability relationships (see Bovens 2007). In practice, the distinction between \ndelegation and participation may be less relevant than Grant and Keohane maintain.    \n The second potentially important distinction is between what Rubenstein (2007) has \ncalled standard and surrogate accountability. In the former, accountability holders \nendorse standards, receive information about the power wielder\u2019s compliance with those \n 6 \nstandards, and (help to) sanction power wielders. In surrogate accountability, each of \nthose actions \u2013 endorsing standards, receiving information about compliance, and \nsanctioning power wielders - can be performed by a third party \u201con behalf of\u201d the \naccountability holder. This typically occurs when accountability holders are themselves \ntoo weak to control and sanction power-wielders. A crucial aspect of surrogate \naccountability is that accountability holders cannot sanction the surrogate or, in other \nwords, surrogates are not links in chains of accountability. The distinction between \nstandard and surrogate accountability is important theoretically and normatively, but it \nis usually difficult to apply in practice because of the difficulty of determining \nempirically when an actor genuinely acts on behalf of another, less powerful actor, \ninstead of simply promoting its own interests and values. Claims to be representing \nanother actor and to be exercising surrogate accountability are ubiquitous in domestic \nand international politics, and the need to ascertain which claims are valid and which \nare not makes the distinction between standard and surrogate accountability difficult to \nwield for descriptive and explanatory purposes.  \n \n \n2. Aims \n \nAccountability is demanded, supplied and studied mainly because of the expectation \nthat it will contribute to establishing, maintaining or enhancing legitimacy. Arguably, \naccountability is neither necessary nor sufficient for legitimacy (and legitimacy is \nneither necessary nor perhaps sufficient for obedience). But there are reasons to believe \nthat accountability is likely to enhance the legitimacy of power in the eyes of those who \nhave delegated it and of those who are affected by it \u2013 as well as being normatively \ndesirable from a more impartial point of view. But are there substantial differences in \nthe aims of, and expectations towards, accountability systems in national and \ninternational domains? \n Bovens has identified three perspectives on the (prescriptively desirable) effects of \naccountability: the democratic perspective, the constitutional perspective, and the \nlearning perspective. Each of them is reflected in discussions about transnational \naccountability. According to the democratic perspective, accountability is important \n 7 \nbecause it helps citizens to control those holding public office. This aim is obviously \nparticularly relevant in the context of liberal democratic states. However, it is not absent \nfrom debates on international relations and global governance. Political theorists such as \nDaniele Archibugi (2008) and David Held (1995) argue that globalization binds \ntogether the fortunes and prospects of political communities around the world, creating \nnew \u201coverlapping communities of fate\u201d. If one accepts that \u201cthose whose life \nexpectancy and life chances are significantly affected by social forces and processes \nought to have a stake in the determination of the conditions and regulation of these, \neither directly or indirectly through political representatives\u201d (Held 2005: 250), the \ndegree to which accountability systems are congruent with those transnational \n\u201ccommunities of fate\u201d is an important yardstick for determining their legitimacy. \n\u201cCosmopolitan democracy\u201d is advocated as a multilayered governance system that can \nincrease the congruence in the accountability relationships between power-wielders and \naffected communities. \n According to the constitutional perspective, the main concern is to prevent tyranny, \ncorruption and the overbearing power of elected and unelected leaders by means of \n\u2018checks and balances\u2019, i.e. institutional countervailing powers (Bovens 2007: 463). Also \nthis perspective is represented in debates about transnational relations. For instance, \nGrant and Keohane (2005) reject the democratic perspective as unhelpful in the context \nof global politics and instead conceive accountability as a way of mitigating the risk that \nvarious actors \u2013 governments, international bureaucracies, companies, NGOs \u2013 will \nabuse their power.   \n Finally, the learning perspective sees accountability as a way to improve the \neffectiveness of policy making and implementation. \u201cThe crucial questions from this \nperspective are whether the accountability arrangements offer sufficient feedback, but \nalso the right incentives, to officials and agencies to reflect upon their policies and \nprocedures and to improve upon them.\u201d (Bovens 2007: 466). Many debates about the \naccountability of transnationally active NGOs, international organizations, and \ntransnational corporations focus on this effect. Public administration and non-profit \nmanagement analysts have considered in depth the question of which management \nstructures, reporting requirements, evaluation procedures and incentive systems are \nmore suitable to improve the performance of organizations involved in international \n 8 \ndevelopment aid and other forms of service provision (e.g. Cracknell 2000). Donors and \ninternational agencies promoted and implemented a range of organizational reforms in \nresponse to shifting perceptions about performance-oriented management, often \nexporting paradigms developed at the national level to the international level (Mizutani \n2004).  \n  \n3. Existence and frequency \n \nThe fact that accountability can be conceptualized and justified in similar ways in \nnational and transnational domains obviously does not answer the empirical question of \nwhether and how existing accountability systems at the transnational level differ from \nthose that are familiar within states, or more specifically within liberal democratic \nstates. This section first suggests that differences between governance at the domestic \nlevel and at the transnational level are not so fundamental as to render any comparison \nmeaningless (a). Then it asks whether all accountability forms identified in section 1 can \nactually be found at the transnational level (b). Finally, it considers whether there are \nreasons to expect systematic differences in the nature of accountability forms and their \nrelative frequency between domestic and transnational settings (c).        \n \n(a)  Modes of governance \nIn some \u201crealist\u201d interpretations of world politics, there is a fundamental difference \nbetween domestic and international politics, and therefore it makes little sense to \ncompare the operation of more specific social mechanisms, such as accountability, \nacross the two spheres. The highly influential theory of Kenneth Waltz, in particular, \nposits a clear divide between anarchy as the political ordering principle of international \nrelations and hierarchy as the political ordering principle of domestic societies. This \nrigid distinction has been the target of sustained criticism over the years (e.g. Milner \n1991), and indeed the increasing use of the concept of \u201cgovernance\u201d to describe forms \nof political interaction and policy-making in domestic as well as international contexts \nis not only an indication that a rigid analytical separation is unwarranted, but also that \naccountability mechanisms, problems and solutions may apply equally or similarly in \nthe two domains (e.g. Benz and Papadopoulos 2006a and Koenig-Archibugi and Z\u00fcrn \n 9 \n2006). It has also been argued that there is a trend towards convergence in the forms of \ngovernance in the two domains. On the one hand, domestic governance is sometimes \nsaid to be increasingly exercised through networks and negotiation systems rather than \ntraditional hierarchical rule. On the other hand, various authors have pointed at a trend \ntowards the supranationalization of international governance (e.g. Z\u00fcrn 2005). \n There are certainly remarkable differences between domestic and international \ngovernance. Above all, the latter remains governance without government, i.e. without a \nworld state. This means, amongst other things, that \u201c[h]orizontal consensus seeking, \nnegotiation and deliberation are not only established parallel to hierarchic \nsubordination, but actually replace it\u201d (Benz and Papadopoulos 2006b: 18). But also the \nsimilarities are significant. At both levels, there is substantial variation among \ngovernance arrangements with regard to key institutional characteristics, which \nelsewhere have been grouped into three key dimensions: publicness, inclusiveness and \ndelegation (Koenig-Archibugi 2002). Delegation is particularly relevant for this paper \nas it is closely linked to accountability. Delegation of tasks and responsibilities to \ninternational agents has largely the same causes as delegation to domestic agencies. \nSome delegation occurs because of expected efficiency benefits: gains from \nspecialization and the reduction of ex ante and ex post transactions costs (providing \nfocal points in negotiations, monitoring compliance, adjudicating disputes, etc.) Some \ndelegation occurs because it increases the credibility of commitments in cases of time-\ninconsistent preferences. Also \u201cdistributional\u201d considerations affect the incentives to \ndelegate to domestic and\/or international agencies. For instance, politicians manage \nblame by selecting those institutional arrangements that avoid or minimize it, and \nspecifically by choosing between direct control and delegation (Hood 2002). \nInternationally, the blame-shifting incentive is often mentioned in the context of the \nrelationship between the IMF and its borrowers (e.g. Smith and Vreeland 2006), but it \nalso has been invoked to explain delegation to private actors, such as the delegation of \nsecurity tasks in conflict zones to private military contractors (Deitelhoff and Wolf \n2008). Moreover, political leaders whose policy preferences are closer to those of their \nforeign counterparts than their own principals may collude and delegate decision-\nmaking to international agencies to circumvent domestic opposition (Koenig-Archibugi \n2004a). In such cases, avoiding accountability to constituencies is one reason why \n 10 \npoliticians delegate tasks to agencies in the first place \u2013 as pointed out below, this \nincentive in turn affects the design of accountability systems between politicians and \nagencies.  \n \n(b) Presence of accountability forms \nIn the transnational domain there are empirical instances of all forms of accountability \nmentioned in section 1. A few examples must suffice. The relationship between the \nmember states of the United Nations and its secretary-general is a relationship of \npolitical accountability: the former select the latter, who has to justify his\/her decisions \nand can fail to be re-elected if his\/her performance is deemed unsatisfactory. The same \nkind of relationship exists between governments and heads of other international \norganizations, who may be forced to resign if the principals lose confidence in them. \nLegal accountability is exercised through a range of international courts, such as the \nInternational Court of Justice (state accountability), or the International Criminal Court \n(individual accountability), but also through quasi-judicial agencies such as the WTO \nAppellate Body. Administrative accountability is exercised through the regular auditing \nof the accounts and management practices of intergovernmental organizations, but also \nthrough novel institutions such as the World Bank Inspection Panel (Clark et al. 2003). \nProfessional and peer review is exercised by a broad range of transnational forums. For \ninstance, NGOs that work together in humanitarian emergencies also monitor and assess \neach other\u2019s performance; and participants in World Health Organization committees on \nstandards perceive themselves as a \u201ctransnational Hippocratic society\u201d, detached from \ninternational power politics and bound by professional norms of conduct (David Fidler, \nquoted by Aginam 2005: 72). Market accountability is exercised by consumers and \ninvestors who, generally after public campaigns conducted by activists, may put \npressure on companies on labour standards, child labour and other issues concerning \ntheir global supply chains (Koenig-Archibugi 2004b). Some of these accountability \nrelationship are vertical (e.g. the relationship between member states and heads of \nintergovernmental organizations, and between the latter and the staff)  while others are \nhorizontal, for instance the relationship between governments that made commitments \non human rights, labour rights, arms control, macroeconomic policy, environmental \nprotection, and then hold each other accountable for compliance through peer review.   \n 11 \n As noted above, electoral accountability is not completely absent from transnational \narenas. Heads of UN agencies and other international organizations are appointed as a \nresult of votes or agreements that are concluded under the shadow of a vote. The \nInternational Council Meeting (ICM) of Amnesty International consist of delegations \nfrom over 50 nationally organized sections and structures worldwide (in proportion to \ntheir size) and elects the members of the International Executive Committee and other \ngovernance bodies. In 2000, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \n(ICANN), which controls the centralized domain name system that routes the majority \nof global internet traffic, held a global Internet-based election to choose five of its \nnineteen directors (76,000 people registered to vote), and Internet users can participate \nremotely to meetings where the directors take decisions. Such elections may not qualify \nas \u201cdemocratic\u201d, but it would be wrong to conclude that electoral accountability lacks \nempirical instances in transnational relations. \n    \n(c) Systematic differences \nWhile present both nationally and internationally, some forms may differ across the two \nlevels. Accountability relationships are often parts of larger chains of accountability, by \nwhich ultimate accountability holders are linked to the ultimate accountability providers \nby intermediaries (Curtin 2007: 525). A distinctive feature of transnational \naccountability is the frequent role of governments as \u201cgate-keepers\u201d in such \naccountability chains. Since most governance beyond the state occurs through \nintergovernmental organizations, governments are in a crucial position of power. For \ninstance, in most international courts only states can acts as plaintiffs and defendants \n(Keohane et al. 2000). On the other hand, even in the domain of IGOs, governments can \nno longer always claim a pivotal role in accountability chains. For instance, the World \nBank is accountable not only to its shareholders but also to international private \ninvestors who supply capital for its projects. In 2006, UNICEF drew 58 per cent of its \nincome from governments and 29 per cent from the private sector and NGOs (UNICEF \n2006). Of the total resources of WHO in 2006-2007, 72 per cent came from voluntary \n 12 \ncontributions, and of those 11 per cent came from companies, NGOs or foundations \u2013 \nnotably the Gates Foundation.2 \n A second systematic difference concerns the relative frequency of those forms at the \nnational and international level. For instance, relationships of social accountability are \nprobably more frequent than legal accountability because \u201csoft law\u201d is more common \nthan \u201chard law\u201d in international relations. Even ILO conventions, which are binding \ninternational law for states that ratified them, depend entirely on peer review and social \naccountability for their effectiveness. The ILO Committee on the Application of \nStandards can draw public attention to the worst breaches of conventions by \nhighlighting them in its reports to the International Labour Conference, but the \nenforcement mechanism is significantly weaker than those usually associated with \ndomestic legislation on labour issues.  \n Finally, for all forms of accountability, surrogate versions are particularly common in \ntransnational relations because of three factors: (1) structural inequalities in the global \nsystem mean that the power differentials between accountability holders and power \nwielders are usually greater than domestically; (2) at the transnational level there is a \nlack of formal institutions that would allow the operation of standard accountability; and \n(3) the larger social and physical distance between accountability holders and power \nwielders reduces the breadth and depth of common life-world experiences as well as the \nintensity and velocity of communication, which hinders standard accountability. \n \n \n4. Causes and trends \n  \nWhat causes the creation and modification of accountability regimes? More specifically, \nwhat explains variation of accountability regimes across issue areas, geographical \ndomains, and institutions? The creation of accountability regimes can be interpreted in \nterms of the interplay between the demands for accountability expressed by principals \nand affected parties on the one hand and the responses of power wielders on the other \n                                                 \n2 http:\/\/www.who.int\/about\/vision\/voluntary_contributions_en.gif (accessed on 19 September \n2008). \n 13 \nhand. This section considers the demands (a) and the responses (b) before examining \nwhether there are reasons to expect that the relationship between demand and response \nis more contentious at the transnational level than it is in domestic contexts (c). Given \nthat most accountability regimes require a multicausal and complex explanation, the \nfollowing remarks should be seen as exploratory.   \n \n(a) Demands \nThe demand for accountability depends to a significant extent on three bundles of \nfactors: (i) the characteristics of the governance arrangement to which it is directed; (ii) \nthe characteristics of the issue that the governance arrangement is supposed to address; \nand (iii) trends in the broader political, social and cultural environment in which policy \nmaking takes place. \n With regard to (i), some authors maintain that \u201cthe very nature of accountability \ndepends on the model of governance that one employs\u201d (Keohane and Nye 2003: 393). \nBut, interestingly, there is less fit between governance modes and accountability modes \nthan one might expect. First, as Keohane and Nye (2003: 403) recognize, in reality the \nmodels of governance they identify are usually blended, and so are accountability \nforms. Second, several forms of accountability are exercised in virtually every kind of \norganization and network: intergovernmental organizations are subject not only to \nadministrative accountability, but also to market accountability and reputational \naccountability; conversely, private actors may delegate powers to third parties and this \ncreates principal-agent problems that are similar to those to be found in \nintergovernmental organizations. In short, there is no simple one-to-one relationship \nbetween modes of governance and accountability forms.  \n However, it is certainly possible to identify links and correspondences between \ngovernance characteristics and accountability dynamics. If we refer to the three \ninstitutional dimensions of inclusiveness, publicness and delegation (see above), all else \nbeing equal, lower inclusiveness (defined as the presence of significant policy \nexternalities) stimulates the mobilization of those negatively affected by decisions and \ndemands to justify those decisions in a public forum. On the contrary, when the \nexternalities are positive, the \u201cinsiders\u201d may demand accountability from the \u201cfree-\nriders\u201d who choose to remain outside of the governance arrangement. Publicness is a \n 14 \nless obvious determinant of accountability demands, but it is plausible that the greater \ncoercion potential that derives from the exercise of public power generates a stronger \ninterest in having that power checked through accountability mechanisms. In other \nwords, it is not only the presence of external effects but also the voluntary\/coercive \nnature of inclusiveness that stimulates demand. Finally, delegation has arguably a strong \neffect on accountability demands: the more functions and discretionary powers are \ndelegated to agents, the more the principals may have reasons for wanting mechanisms \nfor holding them accountable. Principals typically employ ex ante as well as ex post \nmechanisms to control their agents, but the former \u2013 such as the use of detailed rules \nand the selection of agents whose preferences are similar to those of the principal \u2013 \ngenerate some problems that may highlight the benefits of ex post control based on \nreporting and sanctioning (Hawkins et al. 2006: 26-31). But also ex post control \nrequirements may reduce the benefits of delegation to the principal if they become too \ndemanding. This applies to situations in which delegation is motivated primarily by \nefficiency concerns. For instance, it can be argued that principals such as the US \nCongress often prefer to create accountability mechanisms that empower affected \nparties through administrative law because such \u201cfire alarms\u201d limit the efficiency \nbenefits of delegation less than \u201cpolice patrols\u201d, i.e. intense and comprehensive \noversight by Congress itself (McCubbins and Schwartz 1984). But it also applies to \nsituations in which delegation is motivated primarily by the desire to shift blame: \nclearly high levels of accountability of agents to political principals would make this \nstrategy less credible (Hood 2002). \n The sources of accountability demands that have been mentioned so far may result \nlargely from a \u201clogic of consequentialism\u201d: actors demand accountability mechanisms if \nand when they rationally expect those mechanisms to further their interests. However, \nalso the \u201clogic of appropriateness\u201d plays a role (March and Olsen 1998). Even people \nwho may not benefit directly from accountability mechanisms may believe that the \nexistence of such mechanisms is necessary to confer \u201clegitimacy\u201d to governance \narrangements and transnational actors such as international bureaucracies and NGOs \n(Z\u00fcrn 2005). The demand for accountability mechanisms is then not targeted at a \nspecific governance arrangement, but generically at all governance arrangements of a \ncertain type. What exactly is considered \u201cappropriate\u201d may still differ depending on \n 15 \ninstitutional characteristics \u2013 such as publicness, inclusiveness and delegation \u2013 but the \nupshot is that we cannot assume a close fit between the costs and benefits of alternative \ninstitutional designs for specific groups on the one hand and the preferences of these \ngroups for the existence and form of accountability mechanisms on the other: beliefs \nabout legitimacy may intervene in this relationship.  \n An increased demand for accountability as a condition of legitimacy can result of the \nmacrotrends that characterize contemporary global politics according to James Rosenau. \nHe specifically points at \u201cauthority crises\u201d that encourage individuals to replace \ntraditional criteria of legitimacy with performance criteria; but also at a \u201cskill \nrevolution\u201d that expands peoples\u2019 horizons on a global scale and sensitizes them to the \nrelevance of distant events; an \u201corganizational explosion\u201d that increases the capacity of \nopposition groups to press for alternative policies and divides publics from their elites; \nand \u201cmicroelectronic technologies\u201d that enable like-minded people to be in touch with \neach other anywhere in the world (Rosenau 2003: 71).  \n While the orientations and capabilities of either issue-specific or general publics \naffect the intensity and content of accountability demands \u2013 regardless of whether they \nare based on principal-agent relationships or claims of affectedness \u2013 some pressure to \nconform to general legitimacy requirement can also result from the diffusion of norms \nwithin specific organizational clusters, such as the idea that multilateral organizations \nshould adopt budgetary procedures in line with Result-Based Budgeting (RBB) \napproaches (Mizutani 2004, Scott 2005). In the area of private transnational governance, \na similar diffusion effect has occurred with regard to the idea that companies should be \nreporting systematically on social and environmental performance and implement codes \nof conduct or \u2013 less commonly \u2013 that they should engage in multistakeholder \npartnerships on social and environmental issues (Koenig-Archibugi 2004b; Ruggie \n2003). \n While factors triggering demands for accountability mechanisms may be the same in \ndomestic and international contexts, for instance corruption scandals, important \ndifferences need to be kept in mind. Steffek (2003) points out that states are subject to \nspecial legitimacy expectations, as the relationships of domination they embody are \nlargely involuntary, backed by highly coercive powers, and potentially covering any \nissue. Most if not all non-state governance arrangements do not possess these \n 16 \ncharacteristics, and thus the demands on their legitimacy are different, and generally \nweaker.    \n \n(b) Responses \nAgents have usually little choice about how to respond to accountability demands from \ntheir principals. Accountability mechanisms can be specified at the time of delegation \nand built in the \u201cconstitution\u201d of the governance arrangement, or they can be added \nlater, for instance in the form of increasing reporting requirements. In any case, agents \nare unlikely to be able to resist the imposition of accountability requirements, at least \nwhen the demands of the most influential principals converge. Of course, this \nconvergence does not always occur. An example of (initial) divergence are the debates \nabout the shift to Result-Based Budgeting within the United Nations. In the late 1990s \nthe UN member states that had reformed their public administrations in line with New \nPublic Management (NPM) doctrines, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the \nNordic countries, the United Kingdom and the United States, supported the adoption of \nRBB within the UN, but the reluctance of developing countries (but also Japan and \nRussia) slowed down the reform process for three years, until the General Assembly \nadopted a comprehensive resolution in December 2000 (Mizutani 2004). Grigorescu \n(2008) shows that in the early 1990s Western democracies disagreed on the nature and \nthe level of independence of what would become the Office of Internal Oversight \nServices of the United Nations.  \n If accountability demands voiced by a broad coalition of principals are irresistible, \nthe impact of accountability demands voiced by supporters who are not formally \nprincipals, for instance donors, is more indeterminate. In such cases, agencies may resist \naccountability demands, as long as competition for resources among agencies does not \ncreate a substantial incentive to accommodate requests. For instance, the WHO found \nitself in a more competitive environment for health policy funding since the early 1990s \nand had to establish new accountability mechanisms. \n \n(c) Contentiousness \nFor the comparison between domestic and transnational accountability regimes, the \nquestion of the contentiousness of accountability relationships and the existence of a \n 17 \ngap between demands and responses is probably more important than a simple mapping \nof either demands or responses. The question is whether we can expect to see more \ncontention about accountability relationships in transnational contexts than in domestic \nones. For Grant and Keohane (2005), the politics of accountability is less contentious in \nstates, or at least in democratic states, because the participation view and the delegation \nview of accountability converge in what they see as appropriate accountability \nmechanisms (e.g., democratic elections), whereas participation-based demands and \ndelegation-based demands often clash at the international level. The convergence is \nmore problematic at the international level partly because of the lack of coincidence of \njurisdictions and boundaries of interdependence, which means that there is a more \ngeneral incongruence between decision-makers and decision-takers (Held 1995). But \ncontentiousness may not be due primarily to a conflict between the delegation and the \nparticipation view of accountability. On a normative level, there is widespread and \nprobably increasing agreement that being affected by a decision generates some kind of \nentitlement to participation, also in those cases when power is exercised across state \nboundaries. To the extent that obstacles to accountability are normative and not based \npurely on self-interest, contention is thus less likely to stem from some actors\u2019 rejection \nof affectedness as legitimate reason for demanding accountability, and more likely to \nresult from the difficulty of reaching agreement on how to verify and aggregate \ncompeting claims of affectedness in specific situations. In democratic states, the \nadjudication of competing affectedness claims is ultimately performed by voters. In \ntransnational relations, \u201cstakeholder identification\u201d is a problematic and continuously \ncontested process. Some governance arrangements \u201csolve\u201d the problem by assuming \nthat states adequately represent all relevant interests within their jurisdictions and hence \nstate-based consent and accountability mechanisms should be sufficient to legitimize \npolicies. But this \u201csolution\u201d is itself contested, given the fact that some states are not \nconsidered to be representative, and that intergovernmental modes of cooperation do not \nguarantee a distribution of influence that can be widely perceived as \u201cfair\u201d. \n  \n \n 18 \n5. Effects of accountability \n  \nThere is no single and generally accepted metric to assess the effects of accountability \nmechanisms. As noted above, Bovens identifies three general approaches to the \njustification of accountability, which offer quite different yardsticks for assessing its \nconsequences: they focus on (a) its capacity to promote learning and policy \neffectiveness, (b) its capacity to limit abuses of power, and (c) its capacity to realize \npopular control and democracy, respectively. This section offers some exploratory \nremarks on each of these approaches in relation to transnational relations. \n \n(a) Enhancing learning and effectiveness \nThe link between accountability and effectiveness in transnational governance is \ncuriously under-researched. This is partly due to the difficulties of defining what \neffectiveness is, which in turn partly depends on the fact that most policies, even when \nagreed in principle, are likely to remain controversial in practice because of their uneven \nimpacts on interests and values. \n Evaluation teams assessing major programmes of international organizations usually \ntry to evaluate the effect of decision-making and implementation procedures on \noutcomes. However, they usually do not evaluate the basic accountability systems of \nthose organizations, as such a task would normally exceed their terms of reference. \nSystematic attempts by donor governments to assess the comparative \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of \ninternational organizations as a whole normally focus on procedures rather than \noutcomes (Meier 2007). For instance, the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework \n(MEFF) developed by the UK Department for International Development (DfID) \nfocuses on organisational aspects and specifically on corporate governance, corporate \nstrategy, resource management, operational management, quality assurance, staff \nmanagement, monitoring, evaluation and lesson-learning, and results reporting, rather \nthan the actual results achieved (Scott 2005). Similarly, the Multilateral Organisations \nPerformance Assessment Network (MOPAN), which consists of eight donor \ngovernments, conducted several surveys on various international organizations since \n2003, which however are limited to examining the \u201cpartnership behaviour\u201d of those \norganizations in the countries in which they operate. \n 19 \n Academic studies of effectiveness are more likely to connect effectiveness (as \nbehavioural effectiveness or as problem-solving) with basic institutional features3, but \nthere are few studies that conceptualize institutional features in terms of accountability \nmechanisms, and general conclusions about the link between different accountability \nregimes and different aspects of effectiveness are still scarce and tentative. On the \nwhole, there is still little evidence that the distinctive constellation of accountability \nmechanisms that exists at the transnational level has specific effects on effectiveness, \nhowever defined. A comparative study of compliance with domestic, EU and WTO law, \nfor instance, finds that compliance with domestic law is not higher than compliance \nwith EU and WTO \u2013 a finding that leads the authors to reject the hypothesis that \u201clegal \nequality and high compliance rates require an agent that can generally enforce rules on \nthe basis of a superior availability of material resources and can cast a shadow of \nhierarchy\u201d (Z\u00fcrn and Joerges 2005: 3). \n \n(b) Curbing abuses of power \nAuthors such as Grant and Keohane are cautiously optimistic that various accountability \nmechanisms can contribute to curbing abuses of power in global politics. However, the \nability of imposing sanctions is crucial for the performance of this function, and \n\u201csanctions remain the weak point in global accountability since they can only be \nimplemented by the powerful\u201d (Grant and Keohane 2005: 41). While transnational \naccountability mechanisms potentially counteract abuses of power mainly by mobilizing \nalready existing powerful actors, this does not mean that those powerful actors are \nalways the beneficiaries of the behavioural change induced by the possible or actual \napplication of sanctions. For instance, international investors may impose sanctions on \nmining companies that are suspected of harming the interests of indigenous \ncommunities, as it happened in 1996 when Rio Tinto share prices declined allegedly as \na result of the opposition of Australian indigenous groups to the Century Zinc Mine in \nQueensland\u2019s Gulf of Carpentaria (Trebeck 2007). In such cases, investors may not act \nwith the goal of changing a company\u2019s behaviour towards affected communities. In \nother circumstances, (the threat of) sanctioning often emerges as part of a deliberate \n                                                 \n3 See for instance Miles et al. 2002; Young 1999; and Underdal and Young 2004. \n 20 \nstrategy implemented by transnational advocacy networks (Keck and Sikkink 1998). \nThis is the essence of surrogate accountability as it has been discussed above, and \nindeed it appears to be the case that labour rights activists emerged as counterweight to \nthe power of companies in several contexts. This is one of the reasons why, as Benz and \nPapadopoulos (2006b: 21) note, \u201c[i]n international governance, private actors [\u2026] draw \nattention as actors who can improve legitimacy, while in national and subnational \narenas these actors are often deemed to cause legitimacy problems.\u201d  \n Are there reasons to believe that surrogate accountability \u2013 beyond its intrinsic \nlimitations discussed by Rubenstein (2007) \u2013 is less effective in mitigating abuses of \npower in transnational contexts than it is in domestic contexts? One major problem is \nthe fact that the larger physical and social distance between the surrogate sanctioners \nand the intended beneficiaries reduces the ability of the former to understand the \npreferences and situation of the latter. For instance, it is widely believed that the \nmeasures taken by several US trade unions and labour rights groups and directed at US \ncompanies importing garments from Bangladesh after revelations of extensive use of \nchild labour in the Bangladeshi garment industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s \nresulted in the rapid dismissal of an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 children from factories \nand a deterioration of child welfare (White 1996, Hertel 2006). Responsibilities for \nthese developments as well as the long-term impact of the consumer action campaign is \nstill debated, but it is plausible that the communication barriers between (well-meaning) \nUS consumers, activists and legislators on the one hand and the supposed beneficiaries \nof their sanctioning power on the other hand made the market-based accountability \nmechanism less effective than it might have been in a domestic context. In the latter, the \ndecisive leverage on behalf of workers\u2019 interests is usually exercised by the workers \nthemselves \u2013 either directly through trade unions or indirectly through pro-labour \npolitical parties \u2013 rather than by foreign activists, consumers and investors. Such a \nconstellation alleviates the basic problem of surrogate accountability, which is the \ndanger that surrogates \u201cwill sanction in the wrong cases, with the wrong intensity, or in \nthe wrong way (where \u201cwrong\u201d means doing something other than what accountability \nholders would have done)\u201d (Rubenstein 2007). \n 21 \n \n(c) Realizing democracy \nThe assessment of transnational accountability from a democratic perspective raises two \nmajor questions: (i) As a matter of principle, is \u201cdemocratic\u201d accountability possible at \nthe transnational level? (ii) If so, which, if any, existing experiences of transnational \naccountability do qualify as \u201cdemocratic\u201d?  \n This paper cannot even start to address the very extensive debate on question (i).4 \nReflecting the views of many sceptics, Grant and Keohane (2005) note that the absence \nof a global public rules out the possibility of democratic forms of world-wide \naccountability. If this is true, the key question then becomes whether the formation of a \nglobal public is empirically possible. Scepticism is often explicitly or implicitly rooted \nin beliefs about \u201cnecessary conditions\u201d for the existence of a \u201cdemos\u201d that would be \nable to sustain democracy, such as a minimum level of cultural homogeneity, economic \nprosperity and economic equality. Since a detailed criticism of these arguments is \npresented in Koenig-Archibugi (2008), the remainder of this section assumes that, if the \nexperiences of democratization within states provide any insights, global structural \nconditions do not pose an insurmountable obstacle to global democracy. \n Affirming the possibility of transnational democratic accountability is compatible \nwith recognizing the distinctive problems that it faces. Both from a delegation and from \na participation perspective, important aspects of democratic accountability can be \nexpected to be weaker in transnational than in domestic settings. From a delegation \nperspective, chains of delegation and accountability are likely to be the longer the \nhigher the governance level. The potential for \u201cagency slack\u201d is increased. From a \nparticipation perspective, two problems are particularly salient. First, claims based on \ndelegation still carry much more weight than claims based on being affected by the \nactions of the power-wielders. In other words, accountability is too much oriented \ntowards formal principals than would be democratically \u201coptimal\u201d. Second, even if \naffectedness was the key criterion for accountability relationships, participation would \nbe diluted as a result of the larger scale of transnational governance (Dahl 1999).   \n                                                 \n4 See for instance Held 1995, Dahl 1999, Kymlicka 1999, Keohane 2003; Archibugi 2008.  \n 22 \n Even people who would answer \u201cyes\u201d to question (i) above may still answer \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion (ii) - in other words, transnational democratic accountability may be possible \nin principle, but for some reason it has not been realized yet. The reasons why existing \naccountability regimes may be seen as falling short of reasonable thresholds of \ndemocratic quality are manifold. For instance, it has been argued that most or all \nintergovernmental institutions violate principles of political equality, among member \nstates and\/or among their citizens. This may be because some member states have a \ndisproportionate influence on decision-making as a result of superior extra-institutional \nresources and hence better exit options, and\/or because such superiority is reflected in \ninstitutionally formalized differences in voting and veto power (Zweifel 2006; see also \nMoravcsik 2005).  \n Non-governmental organizations have been hailed as agents able to stimulate and \nsustain democratic accountability in global governance.5 James Rosenau (1998) \ninterprets the activities of businesses, non-profit NGOs and social movements as \nproviding \u201cfunctional equivalents\u201d of important aspects of territorial democracy in the \nglobalized space (Rosenau 1998: 41-43). \u201cGlobal civil society\u201d is seen as having a two-\nfold role with regard to democratic accountability. One the one hand, it may promote \nthe democratization of governmental and intergovernmental centres of authority. For \ninstance, in their discussion of the legitimacy of international institutions, Buchanan and \nKeohane (2005) note that \u201ca functioning transnational civil society channel of \naccountability\u2014an array of overlapping networks of external epistemic actors\u2014helps to \ncompensate for the limitations of accountability through democratic state consent.\u201d Jan \nArt Scholte (2005) has provided a comprehensive inventory of the ways in which civil \nsociety organizations increase the democratic accountability of global governance, but \nhe has also highlighted significant challenges to their potential contribution.   \n On the other hand, it has been argued that civil society organizations may promote \ntransnational democratic accountability by contributing to the establishment of \ngovernance arrangements that operate independently from state power. In an important \narticle, Kate and Terry Macdonald (2006) have argued that global democratic \naccountability can potentially be achieved through non-electoral mechanisms embedded \n                                                 \n5 See for instance the critical analyses by Nanz and Steffek 2005, Wolf 2006 and Glasius 2008. \n 23 \nin non-state transnational governance arrangements. They illustrate their argument with \nreference to transnational institutions promoting labour standards in the global garment \nindustry. To the extent that in such institutions a set of citizens hold power-holders \naccountable on behalf of a distinct set of citizens, for instance when consumers impose \nsanctions on companies on behalf of workers in global supply chains, they represent a \nform of surrogate accountability. Surrogate accountability can without doubt be \nvaluable in promoting the interests and rights of people affected by power-wielders. \nHowever, since a crucial aspect of surrogate accountability is that accountability holders \ncannot sanction the surrogate, their functioning hardly fulfils principles of political \nequality and thus their democratic nature is questionable. \n Even if non-electoral accountability mechanisms cannot be considered functional \nequivalents of electoral mechanisms based on democratic representation, they may still \nbe considered as second-best solutions to promote \u201cgovernment for the people\u201d under \nconditions in which \u201cgovernment by the people\u201d is not (yet) possible. However, the \nrelationship between non-electoral and representative-electoral accountability becomes \nmore problematic in such situations in which the former develops at the expense of the \nlatter. Yannis Papadopoulos, for instance, has noted that the \u201cpeer\u201d accountability on \nwhich most forms of network governance are based \u201ccan hardly be achieved without \nsome loss of accountability \u2018at home\u2019 The \u2018logic of influence\u2019 tending to prevail among \nelites involved in mutual deliberation and negotiation seldom coincides with the \u2018logic \nof membership\u2019 consisting of mirroring the preferences of their constituencies.\u201d \n(Papadopoulos 2007: 482). \n \n \nConclusions \n \nNot surprisingly, this overview of transnational accountability has found differences as \nwell as commonalities with accountability in domestic settings. The key conclusion is \nthat there is no clear-cut and consistent divide between those two governance levels \nwith regard to the conceptualization, the normative importance and justification, the \nempirical manifestations, and the causes of accountability mechanisms. Few actors \noperating in transnational spheres are \u201cunaccountable\u201d, or accountable only to a strictly \n 24 \nnational constituency. Moreover, the range of accountability relationships to be found at \nthe transnational level resembles those that are familiar in domestic politics. These \nfindings provide strong support for allowing concepts, hypotheses and methods \ndeveloped for studying accountability mechanisms within states to be employed in the \ndomain of International Relations, and vice versa.6  \n Disagreements among analysts concern mainly the consequences of accountability \nregimes, and whether any of those manifestations of transnational accountability \ndeserves to be called \u201cdemocratic\u201d. Accountability is obviously different from \ndemocratic accountability. This article suggested that, partly because institutions \nreproduce prior inequalities and partly because of the prevalence of surrogate \naccountability mechanisms, few transnational governance institutions meet even \nminimal democratic criteria. However, observers are divided over what explains the \nlack of democratic accountability in world politics, and hence over the prospects of \nchanging this state of affairs. Some regard it as structurally determined and largely \nunavoidable, while others see it as a contingent outcome of political agency and subject \nto change through strategic action and institutional design.  \n The developments explored in this article justify some cautious optimism. For \ninstance, electoral accountability does have a role in transnational relations and its \ndemocratizing potential is not necessarily exhausted. Perhaps more importantly, few \nstill argue that only strictly defined principals are entitled to hold global organizations \naccountable, as prescribed in what Grant and Keohane called the \u201cdelegation\u201d view of \naccountability. The idea that accountability is also due to those most directly and \nintensely affected by decisions is gaining ground as a potentially hegemonic global \nnorm. Even if this norm does not directly translate into demands to establish fully-\nfledged democratic institutions at the global level, there is wide consensus on the \ndesirability and feasibility of institutional changes that could reduce the gap between \naffectedness and inclusion in transnational accountability regimes. The ascendancy of \n\u201cdemocratic\u201d accountability in world politics is far from assured, but the odds are \n                                                 \n6 A study that demonstrates the payoffs of comparing analogous accountability mechanisms in \ndomestic and international settings is Grigorescu (2008). \n 25 \nsufficiently high as to justify sustained efforts in institutional imagination and \nexperimentation. \n \nAcknowledgements \nAn earlier version of this text was presented at the Connex Workshop on \nAccountability, European University Institute, Florence, 21 April 2008, organized by \nDeirdre Curtin, Peter Mair and Yannis Papadopoulos.
