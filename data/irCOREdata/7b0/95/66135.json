INTRODUCTION\nFor any theory22 with an infinite number of conservation laws, we may always assemble the\nconserved currents into a generating function involving a spectral parameter a . If that spectral\nparameter is independent of any other space\u2013time dimensions in the theory, as is possible in the\nsimplest cases, then effectively the theory possesses an extra dimension.23 Moreover, it is always\npossible to openly include this extra dimension in some of the dynamical equations, and not just\nleave it as a dimension sub rosa.\nFor example, suppose a theory is originally expressed in terms of coordinates (x ,t) with an\ninfinite number of conserved currents: ] tr (n)(x ,t)5]xJ (n)(x ,t), nPN. Then by defining\nr(x ,t ,a)[(n(n11)anr (n)(x ,t), as opposed to (nanr (n)(x ,t), and J(x ,t ,a)[(nan11J (n)(x ,t),\nas opposed to (nanJ (n)(x ,t), we have rendered all the conservation laws as a single second-order\nhigher-dimensional partial differential equation ~PDE!: ] tr(x ,t ,a)5]x]aJ(x ,t ,a), as opposed to\nthe first-order ] tr(x ,t ,a)5]xJ(x ,t ,a). Hence our choice for the current generating functions has\nfully exposed an extra dimension in the PDEs satisfied by those generating functions. The extra\ndimension here does not just ride along as a suppressible label for the currents but it appears\nexplicitly, perhaps even unavoidably, in the dynamical equations. Of course this immediately\nraises issues about whether the theory requires a to appear explicitly for all dynamical equations\nto be cogently expressed in terms of the original plus extra dimensions, and about covariance\nproperties for the theory in the complete set of dimensions.\nIn this article we address these issues for a simple but very generally applicable class of\nnonlinear PDE\u2019s:10,17 The first order Euler\u2013Monge ~E-M! equations ] tu5(u\u0095\u201e)u. We find the full\ndynamics of these nonlinear theories are elegantly encoded into a higher dimensional set of linear\n\u2018\u2018heat\u2019\u2019 equations obtained through dimension doubling (x)\u2192(x,a), where for each spatial coor-\ndinate xi there is an associated coordinate given by spectral parameter ai . The original dynamical\nvariables are obtained as spectral parameter boundary limits, lima\u21920Ui(x,t ,a)5 ui(x,t ,a). The\nfact that the higher dimensional theory is linearized strongly argues that this is the right approach\nto take. In the linearized theory, the pairs (xi ,ai) act like \u2018\u2018light-cone\u2019\u2019 variables in the enlarged set\nof dimensions such that the heat equations for all the dynamical variables are of the form (]\/]t\n2( j51\nn ]2\/]a j]x j)Ui(x,t ,a)50. Thus the extra dimensions appear explicitly and, indeed, un-\navoidably in these linearized dynamical equations.\na!Electronic mail: curtright@physics.miami.edu\nb!Electronic mail: david.fairlie@durham.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS VOLUME 44, NUMBER 6 JUNE 2003\n26920022-2488\/2003\/44(6)\/2692\/12\/$20.00 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.65. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jmp.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nWe also find Nambu brackets18 of the fields, of all orders up to the full Jacobian, as a\nremarkable feature of the linearizing maps. We know of only one other field theoretic example3\nwhere these brackets appear so naturally. Moreover, the linearizing maps are nonlocal in all but\nthe simplest, one component case. The nonlocal structures appropriate for E-M equations with two\ncomponents in two spatial dimensions are evocative of phase factors in Wilson loops ~cf. strings!,\nand when the E-M equations describe n component fields in the original n spatial dimensions\nthese structures extend to higher dimensional constructions involving integrals over n21 dimen-\nsional submanifolds @cf. (n21)-branes#. In the one dimensional, one component case, the E-M\nsolution is obtained algebraically from the dimensionally-doubled \u2018\u2018bulk\u2019\u2019 solution for all values of\nthe single spectral parameter. In higher dimensional or multi-component cases the dependence of\nthe solutions on the spectral parameters is more involved. Nevertheless, in all cases the solutions\nof the E-M equations may be obtained from simple limits of those for the bulk.\nII. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES\nThe Euler\u2013Monge equations first appeared in 18th and 19th century studies of fluid\ndynamics10 and analytic geometry.17 Riemann took up a study of the equations in the context of\ngas dynamics, discussing the equations as a theory of invariants20 ~for a modern textbook treat-\nment, see Ref. 8!. His approach is widely applicable to almost all nonlinear flow problems,\nalthough it does not triumph over turbulence. A systematic modern discussion of the E-M equa-\ntions that synthesizes ideas from both geometry and invariance theory can be found in the review\nby Dubrovin and Novikov.9 Most contemporary texts and reviews stress the universal role played\nby these nonlinear transport equations in accordance with Whitham\u2019s theory.21 Essentially all\nnonlinear waves, even those in dispersive and dissipative media, involve E-M equations, or simple\nvariants of them, if the nonlinear wavetrains are slowly varying. This makes the equations par-\nticularly useful for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of nonlinear solutions. The E-M equations\nand their conservation laws also serve as a useful starting point in Polyakov\u2019s study of\nturbulence19 but without yet leading to a general solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\nThe first order E-M equation ]u\/]t 5u ]u\/]x also gives rise to the Bateman equation4 upon\nsubstituting u5 (]f\/]t)\/(]f\/]x). The resulting second order nonlinear PDE is\n05fx\n2f tt22fxf tf tx1f t\n2fxx, and is well known to possess a general implicit solution given by\nsolving tS0(f)1xS1(f)5const, where S0 and S1 are arbitrary differentiable functions of f(x ,t).\nThe structure of this solution incorporates the covariance properties of the PDE: If f is a solution,\nso is any function of f. In fact, curiously, the generalization of this solution to n11 functions\nS0(f),Si(f) of f(x,t), x\u02dc(x1 ,. . . ,xn), subject to a single constraint tS0(f)1(xi Si(f)50, is a\n\u2018\u2018universal solution\u2019\u2019 14 to any equation derived from a Lagrangian which is homogeneous of\nweight one in the first derivatives of f.\nThus the Euler\u2013Monge equations appear widespread across a very broad landscape of physics\nand applied mathematics problems, and therefore it is important to understand their solutions at as\nmany levels as possible. To that end we shall map all solutions of the E-M equations in arbitrary\ndimensions into solutions of second-order linear equations. This type of map is reminiscent of the\nCole\u2013Hopf6,15 transformation ~thoroughly reviewed in Ref. 16! used to linearize the Burgers5,15\nnonlinear diffusion equation, but there are important differences here. The Cole\u2013Hopf transfor-\nmation only works for curl-free u, does not use extra dimensions, and fails for 05k ~the diffu-\nsivity!. The map to follow works for all u, curl-free or otherwise, does use extra dimensions, but\nworks only for k50. ~We hope to extend the method to k\u00de0 and to include the effects of pressure\nin subsequent studies.!\nIII. METHOD AND ELEMENTARY RESULTS\nWe believe it is best to present our results summarily for the simplest examples of fields with\none, two, and three components, and then to extend these results to the general case of n compo-\n2693J.

In the\nfollowing, Mn is the n dimensional nonlinear Euler\u2013Monge operator and Hn is an associated\nhyperbolic heat operator ~introduced in Ref. 19!,\nMn[\n]\n]t\n2(j51\nn\nu j\n]\n]x j\n~1!\nHn[\n]\n]t\n2(j51\nn\n]2\n]x j]a j\n.\nTo begin, however, we will generalize these two definitions to allow for an arbitrary function F in\nthe most elementary results in one spatial dimension. We find that\n]\n]t\nU~x ,t ,a !5FS ]]a D ]]x U~x ,t ,a ! ~2!\nif and only if\n]\n]t\nu~x ,t !5F~u~x ,t !!\n]\n]x\nu~x ,t ! ~3!\nwhere\nU~x ,t ,a ![\neau(x ,t)21\na\n~4!\nu~x ,t !5\n1\na\nln~11aU~x ,t ,a !!\nand F is any function with a formal power series. This simple result follows by direct calculation\nS ]]t 2FS ]]a D ]]x D e\nau(x ,t)21\na\n5eau(x ,t)S ]]t u~x ,t !2F~u~x ,t !! ]]x u~x ,t !

In this\nexceptional one-component case, we may easily extract u(x ,t) from U(x ,t ,a) for any value of the\nextra dimension a as given by the logarithmic expression above. But, in particular, we may extract\nu(x ,t) as a limit of the bulk solution u(x ,t)5lima\u21920U(x ,t ,a). This immediately yields the time\nseries solution12 to the previous E-M equation as a limit:\nu~x ,t !5 lim\na\u21920\net F(]\/]a) ]\/]xS eau(x)21\na\nD5F21F (j50\n\u2018\nt j\n~11 j !!\nd j\ndx j ~F@u~x !# !\n11 jG , ~7!\nwhere we assume F ~locally! invertible in the last step.24 While this time series is an immediate\nconsequence of the previous results, we believe it is neither trivial nor obvious. Similar time series\nsolutions are immediate consequences of all our results. For example, one independent field u in\nspatial dimensions (x ,y1 ,. . . ,yn) with dependent \u2018\u2018velocity fields\u2019\u2019 (u ,v1(u),. . . ,vn(u)) leads to\n2694 J. Math.

The rhs of Eq.\n~10! is then just the formal solution of the heat equation.25\nThe last result does not allow for a simple extraction of u(x ,y,t) from the integral form of\nU(x ,y,t ,a ,b) for nonvanishing a ,b. However, it does have the simple limit\nlima ,b\u21920U(x ,y,t ,a ,b)5u(x ,y,t), so extraction is trivial on the boundary a ,b\u21920. This is true of\nall the other heat equation solutions to follow. Also note, U(x ,y,t ,a ,b) in this one-component case\nis an integral over the field value. Nevertheless U is still local in all the dimensions, no matter how\nmany.\nIV. MULTIPLE COMPONENTS AND NONLOCALITY\nLocality in the original spatial dimensions will not hold, however, for maps of multi-\ncomponent fields in higher dimensions.

The map is still local in the extra dimensions, however. This nonlocality in the\noriginal dimensions persists and is even extended when more components and more spatial di-\nmensions are considered.

And so it goes with subsequent pairs of\nterms on the rhs of HnU1, until finally the last two terms ~last two lines! on the rhs combine to\ngive terms linear in the E-M equations.\nTo establish these statements, one needs to use several identities involving the action of the\nheat operator on exponentially weighted derivatives of the component fields, in particular on\nso-weighted Nambu brackets.

All such identities are straightforward to\nsubstantiate by direct calculation.\nThus, given the E-M equations for the u\u2019s, the heat equation for U1 follows. Moreover, the\nonly terms on the rhs of HnU1 which survive in the limit of vanishing spectral parameters are the\nlast two lines, which give\nlim\na\u21920\nHnU1~x,t ,a!5Mnu1~x,t !. ~26!\nThus, given the heat equation for U1 , the E-M equation for u1 follows.

These conservation laws are elementary consequences of the\nheat equation obeyed by U.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis is as far as we have completed the application of the extra dimensional approach to\nclassical nonlinear PDEs. It remains to apply this approach to other types of nonlinear PDEs, in\nparticular to those higher-order extensions of the E-M equations involving dispersion, such as the\nKorteweg\u2013deVries equation, and to those involving diffusion, such as the Burgers and Navier\u2013\nStokes equations. Another immediately obvious challenge is to carry the method over to quantum\nfield theories ~QFTs!. This will not be done here. However, we suspect that the implementation of\n2701J. Math.

QNBs have a long-standing notoriety, but recently7 it has\nbeen shown that theirs is an undeserved bad reputation. QNBs can be defined in terms of operators\n~or in terms of noncommutative geometry! so as to fulfill their expected roles in the quantum\nevolution of dynamical systems. Perhaps these developments will be useful to meet the challenge\nof quantizing the E-M equations as well as their higher-order generalizations.\nAs emphasized previously, the Euler-Monge equations appear widespread throughout physics\nand the mathematics of nonlinear partial differential equations. Based on the maps we have\npresented to linearize these equations, we have come to the conclusion that extra dimensions and\nnonlocal structures are ubiquitous features to be found upon analyzing solutions of such nonlinear\npartial differential equations, and are quite natural constructs in many physical theories.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nOur thanks to Cosmas Zachos for valuable comments, and to Orlando Alvarez for critically\nreading the manuscript.

For related points of view within the\nKaluza\u2013Klein physics framework,1 see Ref. 2.\n23 More precisely, an extra bosonic dimension. A finite number of conservation laws evokes extra fermionic or anyonic\ndimensions, u, involving kth order superspace or Grassman variables. This and other noncommutative geometries will\nnot be discussed further here.\n24 Given the close relation of the Monge and Bateman equations, it might be expected that the latter also admits a power\nseries solution of simple form.
