The role played by pneumolysin and autolysin in pneumococcal meningitis is poorly understood.\nMethods. A rat model was used to investigate the disease, in which surgical implantation of a cisternal catheter\nallowed bacterial instillation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling.\nResults. CSF infection of rats with wild-type pneumococci caused meningitis within 26 h, whereas isogenic\nmutants that do not express pneumolysin (\u0001Ply) or autolysin (LytA\u0002) caused very mild or no disease. Wild-type\ninfections resulted in pneumococci in the CSF and cortical homogenates, but aminority of the rats infected with\u0001Ply\nor LytA\u0002 had bacteria in these locations at 26 h. Leukocyte numbers in the CSF were similar after infection with all\npneumococci; however, neutrophils and monocytes predominated after wild-type infection, whereas lymphocytes\nand atypical lymphocytes predominated after infection with the mutants. Wild-type pneumococci caused disruption\nto the ependyma, but thiswas not observed in rats infectedwith\u0001Ply or LytA\u0002. Cells surrounding the ventricles inwild\ntype\u2013infected animals expressed caspase 3, and astrocytes had hypertrophy; both findings were absent in rats infected\nwith the mutants.\nConclusions. This study provides strong in vivo evidence that pneumolysin and autolysin play crucial roles in the\npathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis.\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the second most frequent\ncause of meningitis in all age groups throughout Europe\n[1]. In the United States, it is the leading cause of men-\ningitis in children [2]. Every year there are \u0003600,000\ncases ofmeningitis worldwide, with\u0003180,000 deaths. In\nthe developing world, mortality rates as high as 50%\nhave been reported [3]. More than 30% of survivors of\npneumococcal meningitis suffer from neurological\ndamage, including hearing loss [4], cognitive impair-\nment [5], and long-termdefects in spatial learning [6, 7].\nIt is widely acknowledged that there is an urgent need to\nimprove the treatment of pneumococcal meningitis [8].\nPreviously, to investigate the role played by S. pneu-\nmoniae virulence factors, we developed a ciliated epen-\ndymal cell culture model to simulate events in meningi-\ntis. The ciliated ependyma, a single-cell layer that lines\nthe cerebral ventricles and aqueducts [9, 10], is of par-\nticular interest, because it separates infected cerebrospi-\nnal fluid (CSF) in meningitis from the brain paren-\nchyma. Using a rat model, we have demonstrated that\nimpairment of ciliary function and damage to ependy-\nmal cells in culture closely predict similar effects during\npneumococcal meningitis in vivo [11].\nWe recently investigated the toxicity of the pneumococ-\ncal toxin, pneumolysin, on the ciliated ependyma.

In particular,\nthe findings of our ependymal cell culture studies did not agree\nwith those of Friedland et al. [19], who reported that a\npneumolysin-deficient strain of pneumococcus induced disease\nin rabbits that was indistinguishable from wild-type pneumo-\ncoccal infection.\nTo investigate the role played by pneumolysin, we used 2mu-\ntant pneumococci: \u0001Ply, which does not express pneumolysin,\nand LytA\u0002, an autolysin-deficient mutant. The LytA autolysin\ndegrades the pneumococcal cell wall, resulting in lysis and re-\nlease of intracellular and cell wall molecules [20]. Although it is\nknown that autolysin is crucial for pneumococcal virulence dur-\ning pneumonia and septicemia [21, 22], its role in pneumococ-\ncal meningitis is unknown.\nThe present study provides in vivo evidence strongly support-\ning the hypothesis that pneumolysin plays a crucial role in the\npathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis. We have shown that\nafter CSF infection of the adult rat, pneumococci deficient in\neither pneumolysin or autolysin have reduced virulence com-\npared with wild-type bacteria. Unlike infection with wild-type\npneumococci, CSF infection with mutant pneumococci did not\ncause widespread ependymal disruption, glial cell activation, or\ncaspase 3 expression in the subependymal region. In addition,\nwe have demonstrated that our previous in vitro results [17]\npredicted the ependymal damage seen in vivo.\nMETHODS\nBacteria. The wild-type pneumococcus was the serotype 2\nstrain, D39. The isogenic mutants, with inactivated genes for\npneumolysin (\u0001Ply) and autolysin (LytA\u0002), have been described\nelsewhere [23, 24]. To standardize the virulence, all bacteria\nwere passaged through intravenously infected mice before use\n[11]. Pneumococcal numbers were determined by colony\ncounting, as described elsewhere [11]. All mutant bacterial\ngrowth rates have beenmeasured in vitro and were not different\nfrom those for the wild type (data not shown).\nModel of meningitis. All of the experiments on animals\nwere approved by a UK Home Office project license guidelines\nand by the University of Leicester ethics committee. Adult male\nWistar rats (350\u2013450 g;HarlanUK)were injectedwith 104 cfu of\nS. pneumoniae in a total volume of 50 \u0001L into the cisternal CSF\nvia a previously implanted guide tube [11]. The guide tube was\nfixed between the occipital bone and the atlas arc onto the\natlanto-occipital membrane, so that injection of the infectious\ndose could be directed to the cisternal CSF and not the brain\ntissue. Control rats were injected into the CSF with 50 \u0001L of\nsterile PBS. Rats were assessed for clinical signs (weight loss,\npiloerection, hunching, and lethargy), and when they reached\nthe 2\u0004 lethargic stage of the disease [25] (or at a time appropri-\nate for the experiment) they were euthanized by sodium pento-\nbarbital overdose. After the animals were euthanized, CSF was\nremoved from the cisterna magna via the guide tube, using a\ngas-tight sterile syringe. Brains were carefully removed and dis-\nsected. The prefrontal cerebral cortex was removed and homog-\nenized for colony counting [11], and the cerebellum was re-\nmoved for vibrotome sectioning (250-\u0001m sections) and\nFigure 1.

Cells in the CSF were counted in either a\nFuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber (samples\u0006103 cells\/mL) or\na hemocytometer (samples\u0007103 cells\/mL). The cells in the CSF\n(20 \u0001L) were fixed with methanol (20 \u0001L) for 30 min before\naddition of Giemsa stain (Fisher Chemicals; 20 \u0001L; 1:4 dilution\nin filter-sterilized PBS). The counting was done after a 10-min\nincubation at room temperature, and individual cells were iden-\ntified, according to their morphological characteristics, using\nlight microscopy [26]. The cell types that could be readily iden-\ntified and counted were neutrophils, identified by their multi-\nlobed nucleus;monocytes, identified by a cleft nucleus; and lym-\nphocytes, identified by a circular nucleus. Atypical lymphocytes\nwere morphologically unusual nucleated immune cells, as de-\nscribed elsewhere [27, 28].\nCBF measurement. The ependymal CBF was measured as\ndescribed elsewhere [16]. Briefly, beating cilia on ependymal\nedges were recorded by a high-speed video camera (Kodak Ek-\ntaPro motion analyzer) at a frame rate of 400\/s. The camera\nallowed video sequences to be downloaded at reduced frame\nrates, from which the CBF was determined directly.\nElectron microscopy.

Negative control sections had the primary antibody omit-\nted. Sections were inspected using an LSM 510 META confocal\nmicroscope (Zeiss) with a 488 laser line, a 505\u2013550-nm band-\npass emission filter, and a\b40 oil-immersion objective lens (nu-\nmerical aperture, 1.3).\nStatistics.

All rats infected with wild-type\npneumococci developed signs ofmeningitis that followed a time\ncourse notably different from the course after infection with\npneumolysin-negative \u0001Ply or autolysin-negative LytA\u0002. After\n6 h, thewild type\u2013infected rats showed slight piloerection and\/or\nslight hunching and lethargy. By 26 h, all 7 of these rats were\nseverely lethargic (2\u0004) and were euthanized. In contrast, 6 h\nafter infection with \u0001Ply or LytA\u0002, the rats showed no signs of\ndisease, and at 26 h the majority of them (10\/11) still showed no\ndisease signs (figure 1B and 1C). All of these animals were as-\nsessed for 72 h after infection, before they were killed. Two rats\ninfected with \u0001Ply (1 after 48 and 1 after 72 h) (figure 1B) and 2\ninfected with LytA\u0002 (1 after 26 and 1 after 48 h) (figure 1C)\nprogressed to a severely (2\u0004) lethargic stage and were\neuthanized.\nThe decreased extent of disease seen at 26 h after infection\nwith \u0001Ply or LytA\u0002 was accompanied by significantly fewer\npneumococci in the CSF and cerebrocortical homogenates com-\npared with wild-type infection (P \u0002 .05) (figure 2A and 2B).\nHowever, at 72 h after infection, the numbers of \u0001Ply pneumo-\ncocci in the CSF were not significantly different from the 26-h\ndata for the wild-type infections (P \u0003 .05) (figure 2A), but the\nnumbers of \u0001Ply pneumococci in the cerebrocortical homoge-\nnates at 72 h were still significantly lower than the 26-h data for\nthe wild-type infections (P \u0002 .05) (figure 2B). In rats infected\nwith LytA\u0002, the numbers of bacteria in the CSF and cerebrocor-\ntical homogenates had increased at 72 h after infection but re-\nmained significantly lower than the numbers in rats infected\nFigure 3. Leukocytes (A), neutrophils (B), monocytes (C), lymphocytes (D), and atypical lymphocytes (E) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after cisternal\ninfection with wild-type (WT), pneumolysin-deficient (\u0001Ply), or autolysin-deficient (LytA\u0002) pneumococci.

Individual points represent the nos. of cells in the CSF from individual rats, and horizontal lines represent medians.\n*Significantly fewer (P \u0002 .05) rats with cells in the CSF, compared with WT-infected rats.\nPneumolysin and Autolysin in Meningitis \u25cf JID 2008:197 (1 March) \u25cf 747\nwith wild-type pneumococci after just 26 h (P \u0002 .05) (figure 2A\nand 2B). Significantlymore rats had bacteremia after infection of\nthe CSF with wild-type pneumococci than after infection with\neither \u0001Ply (at 26 and 72 h) or LytA\u0002 (at 26 h) (P \u0002 .05) (fig-\nure 2C).\nInflammatory cells in the CSF. No leukocytes were de-\ntected in the CSF of 4 sham-infected control rats. In all\ninfections with pneumococci, the number of cells present\nin the CSF was significantly higher than that in sham-infected\ncontrol rats (P \u0002 .05). There was no significant difference\nin the total leukocytes in the CSF of each infection group,\nat either time point (P \u0003 .05) (figure 3A). However, a sig-\nnificantly higher proportion of rats in the wild type\u2013infected\ngroup had neutrophils in the CSF, compared with the mutant\npneumococci\u2013infected group, at both 26 and 72 h (P \u0002 .05)\n(figure 3B).\nInterestingly, at 26 h, there were more monocytes in the CSF\nof the wild type\u2013infected rats than in that of rats infected with\n\u0001Ply (at 26 h) or LytA\u0002 (at 26 and 72 h) (figure 3C). The CSF of\nrats infected with the mutant bacteria contained lymphocytes\nand atypical lymphocytes. However, the proportions of rats in\nthemutant-infected groupswere not significantly different from\nthat in the wild type\u2013infected group (P \u0003 .05) (figure 3D\nand 3E).\nEpendymal damage. By 26 h after infection with wild-type\npneumococci, there was loss of cilia and ependymal cell detach-\nment, opening of gap junctions, and disruption of ependymal\norganization in the fourth ventricle of the brain (figure 4A). In\ncontrast, the ependymas of rats infectedwith\u0001Ply or LytA\u0002were\nundamaged at 26 h (data not shown) and at 72 h (figure 4B and\n4C) and did not differ from those in the sham-infected control\nrats (figure 4D).\nFigure 4. Transmission electron micrographs of the ependyma within the fourth ventricle of rats infected with wild-type pneumococci (A),\npneumolysin-deficient pneumococci (\u0001Ply) (B), autolysin-deficient pneumococci (LytA\u0002) (C), or PBS (D). In panel A, open gap junctions, detachment of\nthe ependymal cells, and loss of cilia can be observed. Cilia are healthy in panels B (cross-section of ciliary axoneme), C, and D (arrows). Scale bars\nindicate 10 \u0001m, and each micrograph is representative of a total of 145 micrographs.\n748 \u25cf JID 2008:197 (1 March) \u25cf Hirst et al.\nAt 26 h after infectionwithwild-type pneumococci, where the\nciliated ependyma in the fourth ventricle remained intact CBF\nwas significantly reduced (P \u0002 .05) (table 1). In contrast, in rats\ninfected with \u0001Ply or LytA\u0002 CBFs were the same as those in the\nsham-infected control rats at 26 or 72 h after infection (P \u0003 .05)\n(table 1).\nImmunohistochemistry. Animals that were sham infected\nwith PBS appeared clinically normal and were immunonega-\ntive when stained with antibody to active caspase 3 (data not\nshown). Animals infected with wild-type pneumococci had\nhypertrophied astroglial cells (figure 5A), relative to similar\nareas of the lateral ventricle in nondiseased animals infected\nwith LytA\u0002 (figure 5B). Wild type\u2013infected rats also had\nmarked caspase 3 reactivity in ependymal and subependymal\ncells (figure 5C and 5D). An antibody-negative control is\nshown, in which the primary antibody was omitted, without\n(figure 5E) and with (figure 5F) nuclear counterstain. Ani-\nmals infected with LytA\u0002 or \u0001Ply pneumococci had no de-\ntectable caspase 3 immunostaining and no hypertrophy of\ntheir astroglial cells.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we investigated the role of pneumolysin\nand autolysin in the development of meningitis and ependy-\nmal damage in vivo. All of the rats infected with wild-type\npneumococcus developed severe signs of disease (2\u0004 lethar-\ngic) by 26 h after infection of the CSF, and the disease was\naccompanied by loss of ependymal cilia and slowing of CBF,\nas predicted by our previous work [11]. In contrast, the ma-\njority of animals infected with mutant pneumococci showed\nno signs of the disease. All of the wild type\u2013infected rats had\nincreased numbers of pneumococci in the CSF and the cere-\nbrocortical homogenates, but after infection with mutant\npneumococci only a minority of animals had bacteria in the\nCSF and cerebrocortical homogenates.\nThe autolysin-deficient pneumococci showed reduced viru-\nlence even though they synthesize pneumolysin. The reason for\nthe reduced virulence may be an inability to release intracellular\npneumolysin and cell wall components, such as peptidoglycan\nand teichoic acid. Similar attenuation of virulence was found\nwith the \u0001Ply mutant, which does not produce pneumolysin.\nThese results strongly support the hypothesis that pneumolysin\nFigure 5.

[19].\nThe finding that pneumolysin-deficient pneumococci were\nless virulent in meningitis is consistent with the findings of\nWellmer et al. [29], who showed reduced clinical signs in mice\nwhen pneumococci were injected directly into the brain paren-\nchyma as opposed to the CSF. We chose inoculation of bacteria\ninto the CSF to mimic the meningitic process more closely. Al-\nthough this route may not precisely mimic hematogenous\nspread, it is likely to closely mimic meningitis caused by direct\nextension from infected sinuses, otitismedia, ormastoiditis after\nskull fracture and in children with neurocutaneous connections.\nBraun et al. [30], who also used cisternal inoculation of pneu-\nmococci deficient in pneumolysin, found reduced virulence in a\nrabbit model of meningitis. Further evidence for an important\nrole of pneumolysin in meningitis comes from an in vitro study\nshowing that pneumococci deficient in pneumolysin were un-\nable to penetrate the microvascular endothelium, which indi-\ncates that the toxin was essential for breaching the blood-brain\nbarrier [31].\nThe pattern of leukocytes present in the CSF after infection\nwas dependent on the type of pneumococci used to infect the\nCSF, but the precise mechanisms that regulate leukocyte in-\nvasion are poorly understood. The recruitment of neutro-\nphils and monocytes to the CSF after infection with wild-type\npneumococci was expected [32, 33]. It can be predicted that\nthe different patterns of leukocytes in the CSF after the vari-\nous infections reflect different cytokines released. A recent\nstudy has shown that during pneumococcal meningitis\nmonocytes enter the brain parenchyma from the circulation,\nwhere they differentiate into microglial cells and contribute\nto the neuroimmune response [32]. The different patterns of\ncell influx have been shown to reflect differential patterns of\ncytokine\/chemokine released [33]. The exact patterns of me-\ndiators released in response to wild-type and mutant pneu-\nmococci warrant further study. It is noteworthy that rats in-\nfected with mutant pneumococci have increased numbers of\ninflammatory cells in the CSF without clinical signs\nAlthough infection of the CSF with wild-type pneumococci\ncaused slowing of ependymal CBF and ependymal damage,\nthis was not seen in rats infected with mutant pneumococci.\nCiliary slowing and ependymal damage were associated with\nexpression of a marker for apoptosis, caspase 3, and glial cell\nactivation in the subependymal region. In contrast, the\nependyma was intact after infection with the \u0001Ply and LytA\u0002\nmutants, and caspase 3 expression was not seen. This finding\nlends support to our hypothesis that damage to ciliary func-\ntion and to the integrity of the ependymal layer after pneu-\nmococcal infection in an in vitro ependymal cell culture\nmodel predicts ependymal damage in vivo [11].\nThe active caspase 3 immunostaining in animals infected\nwith wild-type bacteria shows that in the acute phase of in-\nfection some ependymal cells initiate an apoptotic cell death\nprogram. Cells surrounding the damaged ependyma were\nalso positively stained, which shows that adjacent brain tissue\nwas also affected and would experience subsequent cell loss.\nIn the acute stage of meningitis, we did not observe any ne-\ncrosis surrounding the ventricles of the rat brains (data not\nshown). Rats infected with wild-type pneumococci also had\nhypertrophied astrocytes in the subependymal region, which,\nin time, may form a permanent glial scar. There is evidence in\nthe literature that, once damaged, the ependyma undergoes\nlimited repair [34, 35]. Therefore, further studies using a\nmodel of meningitis after antibiotic recovery are indicated to\ndetermine whether ependymal regeneration occurs after\npneumococcal meningitis.\nAlthough a small minority of rats developed signs of menin-\ngitis after infection with mutant bacteria, these animals dis-\nplayed no evidence of ependymal damage, caspase 3 expression,\nor glial cell activation in the subependymal region. These find-\nings suggest that other pneumococcal mechanisms of damage or\nother host responses may cause the clinical signs. In a natural\nsetting, pneumococci are unlikely to fail to express pneumolysin\nand autolysin; therefore, ependymal damage remains a good\npredictor of clinical signs of meningitis in wild-type infections.\nThe development of disease signs in rats infected with mutant\nbacteria may be due to other pneumococcal factors, such as me-\nningeal inflammation triggered by the bacterial cell wall compo-\nnents [19]. The similar degree of attenuation of the \u0001Ply and\nLytA\u0002mutants and the similar inflammatory responses induced\nby these mutants support the argument that pneumolysin is\nmore potent than cell wall fragments in inducing pathogenesis.\nIf autolysin-derived cell wall fragments played a significant role,\nthen less attenuation might be expected in the autolysin-\nsufficient \u0001Ply.\nIn summary, the present study showed that, to cause repro-\nducible severe meningitis in the adult rat, pneumococci need to\nproduce pneumolysin. The data support the hypothesis that\npneumolysin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumo-\ncoccal meningitis and could be a valuable target for adjunctive\ntherapy. Autolysin-deficient bacteria are likely to be less efficient\nin releasing pneumolysin and are also unable to degrade and\nrelease cell wall components, which probably explains the reduc-\ntion in virulence observed with these bacteria. Pneumolysin\ncould exert a direct effect on the disease as a result of its known\ncytotoxic activity, but the toxin also is likely to trigger a cascade\nof host inflammatory mediators. Further investigation is under\nway to determine whether pneumolysin and LytA neutralization\nwill provide a useful adjunct to antibiotic treatment.\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank John Beckett for help with the statistical analysis of the data.\n750 \u25cf JID 2008:197 (1 March) \u25cf Hirst et al.\nReferences\n1.
