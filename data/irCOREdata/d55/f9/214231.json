The point of departure is the idea that fear of crime expresses not just \ninsecurities about safety but also broader societal anxieties. A multi-level analysis of respondents \nin 23 countries sampled in the 2004-05 European Social Survey finds a strong relationship \nbetween insecurities about crime and national levels of social expenditure and decommodification \nof social welfare policy. Some social protection measures seem more effective in preventing fear \nof crime than others, especially public non-monetary support for children and families which \nstrengthen the individual\u2019s capacity to cope with problems on their own. We conclude with the \nnotion that state-level social protections buffer the development of widespread fear of crime by \nmitigating various social and economic fears.  \n \nKey words: fear of crime; social protection; welfare state; multi-level analysis; family \n \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nThe negative consequences of crime extend well beyond victims and offenders. Fear of crime \ndamages individual health and community cohesion (Hale, 1996; Warr, 2000; Stafford et al., \n2007), heightens the attractiveness of hard-line crime control strategies (Simon, 2007), and \ncontributes more broadly to the highly politicized and emotively represented nature of crime and \njustice in some European societies (cf. Garland, 2001; Pratt, 2007). Yet public insecurities about \ncrime and safety are often said to be out of proportion to a more calmly judged reality of crime. \nCommon explanations of widespread fear of crime include: (a) a graphic and sensationalising \nmass media, (b) politicians who use the politics of fear, and (c) public intolerance of certain social \nconditions and social groups.  \nRepeated cross-sectional surveys such as the European Social Survey, the Eurobarometer \nand the International Crime Victimization Survey (Aromaa and Heiskanen, 2002; Mayhew and \nvan Dijk, 1997; Nieuwbeerta,  2004; European Opinion Research Group, 2003; van Dijk et al., \n2008; van Dijk et al., 2007; van Kesteren et al., 2000) have found the highest rates of insecurity \nin the Mediterranean countries in Southern Europe, in the UK and in Eastern European societies. \nThe lowest levels of insecurity are normally found in Scandinavia and selected Middle European \nwelfare states (e.g. Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands). Yet thus far the European evidence \nbase remains descriptive. No study has gone beyond the top-line findings of cross-national \nsurveys to explain key individual and ecological factors. Why are insecurities about crime higher \nin some European countries than others? What factors explain national-level variation?  \nThis study is the first comparative, European analysis to approach fear of crime through \nthe lens of wider social insecurities and public concerns about social stability. Drawing on data \nfrom the second round of the European Social Survey (ESS) we find that welfare state \narrangements are associated with levels of public insecurities about crime. The data we present \nare only correlational; we make no claims about causality; the central finding is that welfare state \nregimes of various European countries help explain national-level variance of fear of crime. Yet \nour examination of the association between national-level state arrangements and the national-\nlevel variance of fear of crime provides a significant first step in the development of comparative \nwork in this field of enquiry. Overall our findings contribute to an emerging perspective in \nsociology and criminology \u2013 one that views fear of crime as a response not just to the perceived \ncrime problem, but also to the form, texture and perceived health of the social and political \nstructures. \n \n \n2. The Social and Cultural Significance of the Fear of Crime \nIn exploring the notion that public insecurities might operate as a compound of public concerns \nabout social stability and order, we follow a line of research that sees public anxieties about crime \nas more intelligible against the backdrop of public perceptions of neighbourhood and societal \ncohesion and moral decline. There is qualitative evidence that insecurities about crime are bound \nup in beliefs about declining social trust, intergroup conflict and concerns about the pace and \ndirection of social change (see for example Merry, 1981; Taylor, et al., 1996; Girling, et al., \n2000). Crime may thus act as a cipher for a variety of social, economic and existential insecurities \nthat are rooted in the transformations of contemporary late-modern societies (Hirtenlehner, 2006, \n2008; Sessar, 1998, 2008). And a series of UK studies has found that the effect of broader \nanxieties on worry about crime is mediated by perceptions of neighbourhood disorder and \ncohesion (Jackson, 2004; Jackson and Sunshine, 2007; Farrall et al., 2009). As Hope and Sparks \n(2000: 5) suggest, fear of crime may \u2018\u2026intersect with the larger consequences of modernity, \n[finding] its lived social meaning among people\u2019s senses of change, decay, optimism and \n 4 \nforeboding in the neighbourhoods, towns, cities and wider political communities in which they \nlive and move.\u2019  \nIn fact, the idea that public insecurities about crime are rooted in concerns about \nneighborhood breakdown and stability can be traced back to the beginnings of this field of \nenquiry. In the US in the 1960s a number of victim surveys that were conducted on behalf of the \nPresident\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (1967) sought to \nexplore experiences of crime and anxieties about crime. Fear of crime was assumed by the \nresearchers to be a consequence of personal victimization and representing a distinct concern \nclearly separable from other anxieties. Yet counter-evidence quickly accrued. Neither personal \nexperiences of victimization nor vicarious victimizations nor aggregate crime rates seemed to \nexercise a decisive influence on the extent of fear of crime (Boers, 2003; Hale, 1996; Warr, \n2000). Garofalo and Laub (1978: 243) first summarized the doubts and posed the critical question \nthat was to guide further research: \u2018Is fear of crime simply the fear of crime? \u2026 Does what \nresearchers and theorists have been measuring and conceptualizing as the fear of crime have a \nsimple correspondence with immediate citizen fears about being personally victimized in specific \ntypes of criminal acts?\u2019.  \nThese questions marked the starting point of an interpretation of fear of crime as a \ngeneralized social insecurity. Research quickly focused on so-called \u2018incivility\u2019 or \u2018disorder\u2019 as a \ndriver of public feelings and judgements about crime (Lewis and Salem, 1986; Skogan, 1990). \nScholars examined how public perceptions of risk were embedded in concerns about the social \nand moral order of community, about signs of disruption and loss of control, and about the \ncohesion and stability of social organization. Signs of norms and values in flux; the presence of \ncertain individuals, particularly adolescents, behaving in intimidating manners or judged along \ncertain stereotypical lines; a lack of social trust and informal social control \u2013 numerous studies \nattest to the importance of how people make sense of their environment (Merry, 1981; Skogan \nand Maxfield, 1981; Taylor et al., 1985; Smith, 1986; Taylor and Hale, 1986; Box et al., 1988; \nSkogan, 1990; Warr, 1990; Covington and Taylor, 1991; LaGrange et al., 1992; Perkins et al., \n1993; Hough, 1995; Ferraro, 1995; Rountree and Land, 1996a, 1996b; Perkins and Taylor, 1996). \nPublic perceptions of disorder have also been linked to implicit stereotypes about race and \ndeprivation (Sampson and Raudenbush, 2004) and broader attitudes towards social change and \nmoral decline (Jackson, 2004; Farrall et al., 2009).  \nIncreasingly, fear of crime was treated less as a specific fear of offences and more as a \ncompound of wider feelings of insecurity and a lack of social trust. Scholars began to draw on the \neven more generalized, abstract and removed social theory of Bauman (1997, 2006), Beck (1992) \nand Giddens (1990). Insecurities about crime were here seen as an entity symbolically loaded \nwith even more general social and existential anxieties (cf. Hollway and Jefferson, 1997) \u2013 a \nsponge that mops up generalized sentiments and insecurities that can be understood in the context \nof the radical transformations of late-modern contemporary societies (Hirtenlehner, 2006, 2008; \ncf. Maruna and King, 2004). And whereas some, mostly Anglo-Saxon, scholars accentuate the \nlocal structuring of the feelings of security \u2013 mostly in the form of concerns about the erosion of \nthe common social and moral order of the community (Girling et al., 2000; Jackson, 2004; Taylor \net al., 1996; Oberwittler, 2008; Farrall et al., 2009) \u2013 some continental European scholars have \nemphasized broader themes, connecting crime-related feelings of insecurity and broader socio-\neconomic fears of the future, fears of falling, and ontological insecurity widely conceived \n(Hirtenlehner, 2006, 2008; Sessar, 1998, 2008). For example the steep increase of fear of crime \nlevels in Eastern Germany after the end of communism, at a time of rapid social and economic \ntransformation, may be best explained by this perspective (Boers and Kurz, 2001; Kury and \nFerdinand, 1998; Reuband, 1999; for a review of the German, Swiss and Austrian literature on \npublic insecurities about crime, see Gerber and Jackson, 2009).  \nThe symbolic nature of deviance and crime may thus express deeply felt concerns about \nsocial conditions and \u2018ontological insecurities\u2019 in the face of an unknown future. To contribute to \n 5 \nthis literature we capitalize in this paper on ESS data (Jowell et al., 2007) to show substantial \ncountry-level differences in insecurities about crime across Europe. We find that public \nperceptions of the safety of their streets can be explained, not by different levels of crime, but by \ndifferent socio-economic and socio-political conditions and institutions that affect subjective \nperceptions of social order, trust, security, and ultimately human well-being. In particular, we \ndraw on insights from comparative welfare state research to motivate our study and interpret the \nfindings (Arts and Gelissen, 2002; Castles, 1993; Esping-Anderson, 1990).  \n \n \n3. The Welfare State: Public Manager of Social Risks \nWhy might social security provision protect from fear of crime? Which specific aspects of \nnational welfare regimes might be more effective in achieving this? If fear of crime can be both a \nspecific concern about crime and a more general projection of a range of connected social \nanxieties, then fear of crime should be closely connected with feelings of social insecurity and the \nperception of being unprotected and helpless against accidents that could endanger one\u2019s social \nstatus. In life situations like illness, unemployment, disability or old-age, people are potentially \ndependent on help from other persons or institutions. Accordingly, a social risk can be defined as \nan event that confines an individual\u2019s ability to care for his or her own social independence. \nPeople who are not insured against these social risks are said to live in insecurity (Castel, 2005).  \nThe dependence on labor market income is a characteristic of industrialized and post-\nindustrialized countries. In the course of industrialization \u2013 as a result of increasing urbanization \nand poverty of broad levels of the population \u2013 social policy measures were established with the \ncore idea to safeguard persons against social risks that arise when working capacities fail. Classic \nfields of social policy intervention are income losses due to unemployment, sickness, disability, \nold age, and the birth of children. Thus, social protection consists of diverse policies and \nprograms designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by diminishing people's exposure to risks \nand enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and loss of income. But the \nextent of and the means by which people are protected and supported by the state varies \nconsiderably between different countries.  \n \n \nClassifying welfare states: Esping-Andersen\u2019s three worlds of welfare \nThe studies of Esping-Andersen (1990, 1999) provide a conceptual starting point to compare \nmodels of social policy. In order to distinguish between different models of welfare states, \nEsping-Andersen emphasizes the specific relation between the three main providers of individual \nwelfare \u2013 the state, the (labour) market and the family \u2013 and introduces his central concept of \ndecommodification. Decommodification describes the dependency on labour market income or in \nother words the degree to which \u2018\u2026a person can maintain a livelihood without reliance on the \nmarket\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 22). So public welfare and social policies affect the degree to \nwhich citizens are decommodified.1 Furthermore Esping-Andersen examines which kind of social \nstratification (intensity of redistribution) is promoted by social policy and if the welfare state \nbuilds narrow or broad solidarities (level of universalism). As a further criterion he considers the \nrole of the state and the market in pension regimes (private-public mix). \nMainly based on the two first dimensions \u2013 the level of decommodification and the \nmanner of stratification \u2013 Esping-Andersen comes to the conclusion that welfare states cluster \ninto three distinct regime-types: liberal, conservative-corporatist and social-democratic. In liberal \nwelfare states like the Anglo-Saxon countries UK, Ireland, USA, Canada and Australia2 social \npolicy is characterized by only modest transfers and means-tested assistance. The entitlements to \nsocial transfers are often strict and associated with stigma. Liberal welfare states are characterized \nby the dominance of the market, low social spending and accordingly a low level of \n 6 \ndecommodification. In contrast social democratic welfare states (like the northern countries \nDenmark, Sweden and Norway) are strongly interventionist and provide generous and universal \nbenefits. Corresponding they dispose of a high level of decommodification. The conservative \nwelfare states (like the continental and southern European countries of Germany, France, Austria, \nBelgium and Italy) can finally be placed between the low decommodifying liberal regime and the \nhighly decommodifying social democratic regime (1990: 27). Both in terms of \ndecommodification and defamilisation the Nordic countries are at one extreme. At the other \nextreme we find the Anglo-Saxon countries with the lowest degree of decommodification and the \ncontinental and southern European countries an intermediate degree of decommodification and \nthe lowest degree of defamilisation. However, the number of country groups has always been \ndiscussed in research (cf. Arts and Gelissen, 2002), for instance if there is an independent \nsouthern European type of welfare with a stronger emphasis on the family as social security \nprovider (cf. Ferrera, 1996; Flaquer, 2000; Trifiletti, 1999). In the course of the eastern European \nexpansion of the European Union post-socialist countries are becoming increasingly the object of \nsocial policy research. Several authors have tried to apply the welfare regime typology to eastern \nEurope (Fenger, 2007). Since the eastern European countries are still in the process of \ntransformation and very heterogeneous it is hard to characterize them in terms of welfare \ncharacteristics. One cannot implicitly assume that they form an independent welfare cluster. But \ndue to the great political and social upheavals in the past decades it seems reasonably that their \ncitizens dispose of comparatively high levels of insecurity feelings.  \nExpanding the scope of opportunities  \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s welfare state typology sensitizes us to the fact that there are not only country \ndifferences in the extent of state intervention and welfare provision, but there are also differences \nin the manner how welfare is \u2018produced.\u2019 Ways and instruments of social protection by the state \ndiffer considerably between welfare regimes. Therefore, the generalization of all forms of social \npolicy intervention ignores the fact that welfare states also vary in the relative emphasis that they \nplace upon different policy areas (family, employment, poverty reduction, education, etc.) and \nupon different instruments, for instance cash benefits and services (Bambra, 2005).  \nBased on these considerations, our assumption is that not all social protection measures \nlead to the same result. We propose to distinguish idealtypically between two types of welfare \nstate intervention. On the one hand are measures which accumulate and sustain individual \nresources; on the other hand are measures which in the first instance are designed to reduce \npoverty by providing income maintenance. While the first type of measures prevents against \nhazards and loss of income by supporting the individual income formation process, the second \ntype has a more repairing function by compensating for a lack of income. Public provision of \neducation and early childcare are examples for the first type. Examples of the second type are \nunemployment benefits, social assistance, child allowance and other cash benefits. This kind of \nintervention works rather ex post as reaction on results (for instance poverty, unemployment, \ndisability, illness, etc.).  \nFollowing social psychological research we argue that these two types of social policy \nmeasures should have different effects on people\u2019s fear disposition. Namely we assume that they \nhave unequal effects on individual\u2019s ability to cope with hazards and risky situations. In doing so, \nwe draw upon the psychological concept of \u2018locus of control\u2019 (Rotter, 1966) and related concepts \n(like \u2018self-efficacy\u2019, see Bandura, 2004, or \u2018sense of coherence\u2019, see Antonovsky, 1987). Within \nthe framework of social learning theory Rotter developed this concept which denominates \ngeneralized expectations of an individual with regard to its ability to influence situations and \nevents in his life by own behavior (internal control) or not (external control). People with an \ninternal locus of control have a stronger belief in their ability to influence events, feel less \nhelpless, more independent and are as a result less fearful than people with an external locus of \n 7 \ncontrol (for a discussion of the role of perceived control in fear of crime, see Killias, 1990; \nTulloch, 2003; Jackson, in press). \nConsidering the proposed two prototypes of welfare measures, we suggest that the \nconditions of social protection shaped by the welfare state are related to the extent to which \npeople perceive their lives as internally controllable by their own actions or as externally \ncontrolled by chance or outside forces (cf. Figure 1; cf. definition of \u2018locus of control\u2019 by Myers, \n1996). Welfare investment in public education and childcare increases individual resources and \nopportunities in different respects, for instance by enhancing children\u2019s social and cognitive \ncapacities and by enabling both parents to work. In this way, the type of state intervention has an \nactivating effect on the individual and promotes an internal locus of control. Although income \ncompensating measures are indispensable in a welfare state because they cushion structural \nproblems and ease poverty, they treat citizens as passive recipients of welfare benefits and do not \ncontribute to a strengthening of individual coping skills. In fact, one can assume that welfare \nstates without any activating measures rather promote an external locus of control and feelings of \nhelplessness.  \n \nFigure 1: Theoretical link between welfare state policy and fear of crime \n  \nBased on these theoretical remarks we hypothesize that the extent of welfare provision in general \nhas a negative impact on crime-related feelings of insecurity. The higher the capacity of the \nwelfare state to cushion social and economic risks, the less existential insecurity should be left to \nbe projected onto crime. But at the same time we assume that some welfare measures are more \nappropriate and more effective in reducing fear of crime than other ones. Programs which \nenhance people\u2018s capacity to protect themselves against hazards and loss of income should be \nmore effective in reducing feelings of insecurity than income compensating measures that are \nmainly applied when the income formation process already failed.  \n \n \n4. Data, Measurement, and Methods \nData  \nThe analyses are based on individual-level data from Round 2 of the European Social Survey \n(ESS) 2004\/05 (Jowell et al., 2007) complemented with country-level data from various official \nstatistics. The ESS is a cross-national comparative survey containing data from over 20 European \nUnion Member States. The following 23 countries are included in our study: Austria, Belgium, \nCzech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, \nIceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, \nSpain, Sweden and Switzerland. For methodological reasons we had to exclude Turkey and \nUkraine since for these countries no comparable country-level data are available. All together, we \nhave data on about 43,000 individuals, approximately 2,000 for each country. In all analyses the \ndesign weight provided with the ESS data is applied to correct for unequal selection probabilities \nof the individuals in all countries.  \n \nResponse Variable: Public Insecurities about Crime \n 8 \nOur response variable is the so-called \u2018standard indicator\u2019 of fear of crime. The question is: \u201cHow \nsafe do you \u2013 or would you \u2013 feel walking alone in this area after dark?\u201d This item has frequently \nbeen criticized for its vagueness and its feeble semantic association with actual crime, whereas \nalternative questions more directly gauge concrete fears, e.g. the degree of worry connected to a \nspecific crime (Boers, 2003; see also Farrall et al., 2009). However, precisely for this reason we \nbelieve that this standard item is highly suitable to measure general feelings of insecurity \nprojected onto the symbolic issue of crime. The answer categories to this question are on a scale \nfrom 1 (very safe) to 4 (very unsafe). When looking at the distribution of the variable it appears \nthat most of the respondents feel safe (51%) or very safe (25%). Just 19% feel unsafe and 5% feel \nvery unsafe. In our main analyses we use this ordinal variable without modification in order to \nmaintain the differentiation between the four categories.  \n \nExplanatory variables \nAmong our explanatory variables, we distinguish between country-level and individual-level \ncharacteristics. Our main research question concerns country-level characteristics, more precisely \nthe influence of social protection measures on fear of crime. The country-level variables should \nreflect both the extent of social protection provided by the welfare state as well as spending \npriorities. We use country\u2019s total spending for social protection and social spending subdivided \nfor the following areas: health, families\/children, unemployment, pensions, disability\/physical \nhandicaps, housing conditions and social exclusion. Furthermore we account for different forms \nof social spending by distinguishing between cash benefits and benefits in kind. Finally we regard \npublic expenditures on education as a social protection measure by the welfare state (cf. \nAllmendinger, 1999; Hega and Hokenmaier, 2002; Hokenmaier, 1998). The conventional \nmeasure in cross-national comparisons is spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product \n(GDP) which demonstrates the spending priorities of countries. The data are taken from \nEurostat\/ESSPROS.3 Due to reasons of availability we decided to use data that refer to the year \n2004. This might be seen by some as problematic when assuming a lagged effect, yet country \ndifferences in social expenditures do show a high level of inertia over time.  \nAt country level we also control for the impact of other relevant characteristics (cf. \nAppendix, Table A1). First, registered crime rates and survey-based victimization rates have to be \nconsidered in order to reject the alternative hypothesis that fear of crime is a reflection of factual \nvictimization risks. The official crime rates (offences per 100,000 population in 2003) are taken \nfrom European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics (2006).4 The survey-based \nvictimization rates are constructed by aggregating an ESS-item measuring whether the respondent \nor a member of his household has been the victim of a burglary or an assault in the last five years. \nSecond, we allow for many other structural variables like the poverty risk before and after social \ntransfers, the degree of income inequality (Gini index), the employment and unemployment rate, \nthe share of urban population and, the share of persons aged 65 and older. These data are taken \nfrom the Eurostat or the OECD database.5 Moreover we constructed an indicator which reflects a \ncountry\u2019s degree of decommodification. Decommodification refers to the liberation of the citizens \nfrom the forces of the labour market, to the extent \u2018\u2026a person can maintain a livelihood without \nreliance on the market\u2019 (Esping-Anderson, 1990: 22). As such, it may serve as a general indicator \nfor the strength of the welfare state.6 Following the strategy proposed by Messner and Rosenfeld \n(1997) we created a proxy-measure of decommodification based on total social expenditure in % \nof GDP, on annual social expenditures per capita and on expenditures allocated to employment \ninjuries in % of total social expenditures.7  \nOn the individual level of respondents, we control for the main socio-demographic \nvariables age, gender, education, and employment status. Age is modeled as a non-linear \npredictor because previous research has shown that younger and older persons are more fearful \nthan middle-aged persons (Greve, 1998). Education is measured in years of full-time education. A \n 9 \nnegative correlation between level of education and fear of crime has been one of the most robust \nfindings in the research literature. A dummy variable indicates whether the respondent is \nemployed (1) or not (0). Furthermore we control for the size of the hometown as indicator for \nlocal incivilities and finally, whether the person or a household member has already been a victim \nof burglary or assault during the past five years.8    \nIn order to control for compositional socio-demographic effects (see below), all \nindividual- and country-level predictors are centered around the grand mean (Enders and Tofighi, \n2007). \n \nAnalysis Strategy: Multilevel Modeling \nUsing data on countries as well as on individuals enables us to disentangle the influence of \nindividual-level and country-level characteristics on fear of crime. Moreover we get quantitative \nestimates of the extent to which welfare protection measures account for differences in national \nfear of crime levels by simultaneously taking into account the effect of individual characteristics. \nThe appropriate method to evaluate the relationship between fear of crime and the explanatory \nvariables on individual and country level is multilevel analysis (Snijders and Bosker, 1999; Hox, \n2002; Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002). Multilevel modeling is attractive because it provides a \nstatistical tool for analyzing data sets in which respondents are nested in higher-level units - in \nthis case countries. In multilevel models, it is possible to examine the influence of individual \ncharacteristics (level 1) and national characteristics (level 2) net of each other. By controlling \nrelevant individual level influences on fear, we thus account for potential compositional effects \nwhich may explain country-level variations of our outcome variable. The effects of level 2 \npredictors are then interpreted as contextual effects \u2013 as \u2018true\u2019 effects of the macro-level context \nindependent of individual effects. As we are interested in explaining country-level mean \ndifferences in fear (not differences in coefficients), we employ random-intercept models in which \nthe slopes (coefficients) remain fixed.  \nWe perform non-linear, ordinal regression (with listwise deletion) using the unmodified \nfear of crime standard item. This type of modeling is most appropriate since the dependent \nvariable has ordered categories (1=very safe to 4= very unsafe), and a logistic regression using a \ndichotomized outcome would unduly reduce the breadth of information. The calculations for this \nstudy were performed using HLM 6 (Raudenbush et al., 2004).  \nAfter presenting some first descriptive results we proceed step by step, beginning with an \nestimation of an empty model (Model 0) without any predictors in order to establish the general \nvariance of country differences in fear of crime. In a further step, we include the individual-level \nvariables (Model 1). Finally we incorporate alternately single welfare and structural indicators on \ncountry-level to test which country characteristics explain best country-level variability in fear of \ncrime. We also tested a number of models with two or more level 2 predictors. However, very \nfew coefficients reached significance when added alongside the strongest predictor, or else \nmulticollinearity became a problem. This is often observed in aggregate data analyses on very \nhigh geographical levels. Very small sample sizes and high levels of inter-correlations between \nindependent variables render complex modeling difficult, and the comparison of alternative \nmodels with few or only one predictor on the critical context level becomes the more successful \nstrategy. \nOne final remark on the general difficulty to empirically identify higher-level, contextual \neffects on individual behavior or attitudes is warranted. Compared to pure individual-level \nanalyses where the association between independent and dependent variables rests within single \nunits (persons), multi-level analysis is faced with the more complex task to model associations \nacross units, i.e. influences from a macro level on the micro-level. The macro-micro-link \ngenerally assumes that individuals think or behave differently according to structural restraints or \ncultural conditions which are constant within each macro-level unit but vary between macro-level \n 10 \nunits. Yet, this rather detached influence from a macro- to a micro level can hardly be \u2018observed\u2019 \nin a direct way which raises the question of social mechanisms and causality (Bunge, 1997; \nHedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg, 1998). Thus, theoretical explications about social mechanisms \ntranslating macro-level influences into individual behavior are harder to test empirically than in \nindividual-level analysis.  \n \n \n5. Empirical Findings \n5.1 Descriptive results: Fear of crime in Europe \nFigure 2 shows the share of population feeling unsafe or very unsafe walking alone in their area \nafter dark9. By far the highest levels of insecurity can be observed in Estonia and Slovakia where \nmore than one third of the population reports fear of crime. Next, other Eastern European \ncountries (Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic but not Slovenia) together with the Anglo-\nSaxon countries Ireland and Great Britain show high fear levels, too. On the other end of the list, \nthe Northern countries Iceland, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Sweden as well as Slovenia \ndisplay low fear levels, while the Middle and Southern European countries range in between.  \n \nFigure 2:  Percentage of the population with fear of crime (feeling unsafe or very unsafe \nwalking alone in the dark) \n9.7 10.7 10.8\n11.1\n13.3\n15.9\n17.7 18.3\n19.1\n21.0 21.7\n23.6\n24.8 25.4\n27.3\n29.3 30.0\n30.8 30.8 31.9\n33.7\n39.7 40.0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nSlo\nve\nnia\n    \n  \nIce\nlan\nd  \n    \n \nFin\nlan\nd  \n    \n \nNo\nrw\nay\n    \n    \nDe\nnm\nark\n    \n   \nSw\nitz\nerl\nan\nd  \n \nAu\nstr\nia \n    \n  \nNe\nthe\nrla\nnd\ns   \nSw\ned\nen\n    \n    \nPo\nrtu\nga\nl   \n   \nBe\nlgi\num\n    \n   \nSp\nain\n    \n    \n \nGe\nrm\nan\ny  \n    \n \nFr\nan\nce \n    \n   \nLu\nxem\nbo\nur\ng  \n  \nGr\neec\ne   \n    \n \nIre\nlan\nd  \n    \n \nHu\nng\nary\n    \n   \nPo\nlan\nd  \n    \n  \nCz\nech\n R\nep\nub\nlic\nUn\nite\nd K\ning\ndo\nm\nSlo\nva\nkia\n    \n  \nEs\nton\nia \n    \n  \nPe\nrc\nen\nt\nNorthern countries Post-Socialist\ncountries\nAnglo-Saxon\ncountries\nContinental \/ Southern \nEuropean countries  \n \nConsidering the level of social protection according to Esping-Andersen\u2019s welfare state typology \nthis clustering of countries corresponds with our basic hypothesis: the Nordic social-democratic \ncountries display high levels of social protection and low levels of fear. In contrast the Anglo-\nSaxon and Eastern European countries have low levels of social protection and high levels of \ninsecurity feelings. The continental European countries range in both terms in between. Hence, \nthese descriptive results already support the expected negative association between the extent of \nsocial protection and fear of crime.   \n \n 11 \n5. 2 Multivariate Results: individual-level determinants \nStarting the multivariate analysis and following usual multilevel modeling strategies, we first \nestimate an empty model without any explanatory variables at either individual or country level \n(cf. Table 1, Model 0). The empty model serves as a starting point for partitioning the variance of \nthe dependent variable into a between- and a within-country component and for comparing the \nreduction of these variance components in subsequent models. A special feature of ordinal \nregression analysis is to estimate thresholds (D2 and D3) which represent the odds that \nrespondents chose a certain category above the lowest category which is represented by the \nintercept.10  \nThe variance components of Model 0 show that the between-country variation is \nstatistically significant. In order to get a rough impression what share of total variance in fear is \nattributable to between-country differences we compute the intraclass correlation coefficient \n(ICC) switching to a linear regression model because nonlinear regression does not allow for a \nstraight-forward computation of ICC (Snyders and Bosker, 1999: 224). 8.2% of the variance is \ndue to country-level variability which constitutes a sizable proportion (Raudenbush and Sampson, \n1999). \nModel 1 introduces in a second step the key individual characteristics associated with \nfear of crime at respondents\u2019 level. The slight increase of the country-level variance component \nUo from 0.361 in model 0 to 0.381 in model 1 indicates that country differences become even \nlarger when socio-demographic composition is controlled for. In effect, differences in socio-\neconomic characteristics have slightly suppressed the magnitude of between-country differences \nin fear.  \nLooking in detail at the influences of individual-level characteristics on fear of crime in \nmodel 1, well-known findings from previous criminological research are confirmed. The \nassociation between age and fear is u-shaped: younger and older persons are more fearful than \nmiddle-aged persons. Women feel much more insecure than men11. Higher education and labor \nmarket participation has a fear-reducing effect whereas feelings of insecurity rise with increasing \nsize of the place of residence being largest in big cities and smallest in country villages. Finally, \nformer victimization experiences raise the fear level by 25%. \n 12 \nTable 1: Results of ordinal multilevel analyses on fear of crime \n \nCoef. OR P Coef.

In a third \nstep we therefore test the effect of welfare measures on the country-level (Level 2). We use social \nprotection indicators subdivided for different areas (health, family\/children, old age, etc.) and \nforms of spending (cash benefits versus benefits in kind) as well as some general indicators. \nProceeding from model 1, we add welfare and structural indicators on level 2 alternatively, each \none at a time. The aim of this procedure is to determine the explanatory power of every single \nindicator (net of individual and compositional effects) as expressed in its contribution to the \nreduction of variance at the country level. Instead of printing a multitude of model tables we \npresent the findings of this step of modeling by graphically displaying the respective reduction of \ncountry-level variance in percent compared to model 1 (cf. Figure 3). \n \nFigure 3:  Explanatory power of welfare measures and other country characteristics on fear of \ncrime; results from ordinal multilevel analyses \n \n 13 \nexpenditure on social protection\nas % of GDP \nother country-level characteristics\n0.4\n0.7\n4.4\n4.8\n5.2\n5.7\n8.6\n18.2\n24.2\n25.8\n27.2\n30.2\n33.9\n42\n50.9\n51\n63.9\n64.6\n14.2\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nCash benefits for families\/children\nExpenditure on Housing\nExpenditure on Pensions\nIncome inequality (Gini-Index)\nExpenditure on Old-Age\nExpenditure on Unemployment\nVictimization rate\nRegistered crime\nExpenditure on Social Exclusion\nExpenditure on Health\nPercentage of persons with tertiary education\nPoverty rate after social transfers\nUnemployment rate\nSocial protection expenditure (total)\nIndex of decommodification\nExpenditure on Disability\/Physical Handicap\nEmployment rate\nExpenditure on Education\nBenefits in kind for families\/children\ncountry-level variance reduction in % compared to level-1-model\n \n \nIt is obvious that the explanatory power differs considerably between different social protection \nindicators. Total expenditure on social protection indeed explains 33.9% of the country-level \nvariance. Our index of decommodification, another general indicator for the strength of the \nwelfare state, reproduces 42% of the intercept variance. But the differentiation in terms of areas \nand forms of welfare support reveals that some measures are much more powerful than others in \nexplaining fear of crime.  \nFamily benefits in kind and education expenditures are by far the most effective welfare \nindicators in our models, explaining the largest amount of variation in fear of crime across the 23 \nexamined countries. The programs subsumed under family benefits in kind are mainly early \nchildhood education and care and home-help services. The effect of family benefits in kind is \nhighly significant and reduces the country-level variance compared to model 1 (cf. Table 1) by \n64.6%. Expenditure on education is the second most effective welfare indicator, explaining \n63.9% of the country-level variance. Expenditure for disabilities and physical handicaps also still \nexplains a substantial amount of country-level variability (50.9%). By contrast, other welfare \nmeasures like cash benefits for families, expenditures on pensions, old-age and housing are of \nalmost no importance. The crucial relevance of the mode of welfare intervention becomes very \nevident when comparing the cash benefits for families which have no significant explanatory \npower with benefits in kind for families which have the strongest explanatory power.    \nIn order to detect the relative importance of social protection measures in comparison to \nother country-level characteristics and to guard against the spuriousness of our findings we tested \nthe impact of different alternative, structural variables on our dependent variable. The results in \nFigure 3 show that some of them are also closely connected with fear of crime, for instance the \nemployment rate (51%) or the unemployment rate (30.2%), while others which are conceptionally \n 14 \nmore closely associated with fear of crime - like the registered crime rate or the victimization rate \n- have little explanatory power, again confirming previous research.  \nFigure 4 visualizes the strong negative association between fear of crime and family \nbenefits in kind. For this scatter plot, we predicted the mean country values of fear of crime \n(again using the same individual variables in order to control for compositional effects) from \nmultilevel logistic regression because the different thresholds of the ordinal regression model \ncannot be easily visualized. The plot shows a pattern of country clusters corresponding to Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s welfare regimes. There are three discernable country clusters: the Northern countries \nwith the highest family benefits in kind and the lowest fear levels; the Anglo-Saxon and the \nEastern-European countries (with exception of Hungary and Slovenia) with the lowest family \nbenefits in kind and the highest fear levels; and the Southern- and Continental-European countries \nin between.  \n \nFigure 4:  Correlation between fear of crime (predicted probabilities) and family benefits in \nkind; results from logistic multilevel modeling \n \n \n \n5.4 Robustness checks \nMultivariate analysis of cross-national phenomena is particularly susceptible to statistical \nproblems due to small Ns on country level. Therefore we employed different strategies to test the \nrobustness of our results. First, we estimated alternative multilevel models comparing ordinal \nwith logistic non-linear regression based on a dichotomized outcome variable. Logistic regression \nyielded basically the same results but ordinal regression turned out to produce stronger findings in \nterms of odds ratios of level 2 predictors. Second, the explanatory power of our most influencing \ncountry-level variables \u2013 family benefits in kind and education expenditure \u2013 remains stable when \n 15 \nincluding country-level control variables as the Gini-Index of income inequality, the employment \nrate, the victimization or official crime rate.12 Third, the strong association between family \nbenefits in kind and fear of crime persists when excluding whole country clusters (either the \nNordic countries or the Eastern European countries) from the sample. Thus, the association \nbetween family benefits in kind and fear of crime is not due to regional cluster effects. And \nfinally, no influential outliers were detected; the highest value of Cook's distance is 0.64 for \nDenmark.  \n \n \n6. Conclusion \nCapitalizing on two different lines of contemporary research in fear of crime \u2013 the generalized \ninsecurity approach, and the analysis of cross-national differences in the extent of fear of crime \u2013 \nthis article has examined the relationship between social security and anxieties about crime. If \nfear of crime operates \u2018as a sponge, absorbing all sorts of anxieties \u2026 from family to community \nto society\u2019 (Jackson, 2006: 261) then state-level social protection measures may buffer the \ndevelopment of widespread fear of crime by mitigating various social and economic fears which \nwould otherwise be projected onto crime. One mechanism by which this works may be the locus \nof control: social security may help people feel in control of their lives, thus protecting against \nspecific social anxieties. We live in an era of rapid social change and fundamental societal \ntransformations. The more public insecurities are neutralized by welfare security arrangements \nthe less social anxieties may be channeled into crime. Our empirical findings are consistent with \nthis idea: higher social expenditure was associated with lower fear of crime; a higher degree of \ndecommodification of social welfare policy was accompanied by lower levels of crime-related \nfeelings of insecurity.  \nA second goal of our research was to identify those welfare programs that are most \neffective in reducing fear of crime. We hypothesized that preventative-activating measures, which \nstrengthen the individual\u2019s capacity to cope with problems on their own, are more promising in \nthis respect than pure income compensating measures that are mainly applied when the income \nformation process already failed. The empirical findings were in line with our theoretical \nassumptions about underlying micro-level mechanisms. Country-level variables which are linked \nwith individuals\u2019 capacities and activities to care for own economic and social independence, \nprimarily social protection measures on early childcare and education, but also employment and \nunemployment rates, seem to have the strongest fear-reducing effect. In contrast, social protection \nmeasures and other indicators that rather rely on mere financial support, for example \nunemployment, old-age and other cash benefits, are not associated with fewer public insecurities \nabout crime. Social support in form of cash benefits is rather reactive, i.e. it occurs in particular in \nsituations where the ability to earn a livelihood is (temporarily) restricted (unemployment, \nsickness) or when economic needs increased (e.g. at the birth of children). All these situations are \nlinked with the risk that one\u2019s own financial resources fall short to assure livelihood, leaving \npeople dependent on help from other people or institutions. Consequently, feelings of (social) \nsecurity can hardly arise from this kind of welfare state support. In contrast welfare measures \nwhich contribute to people\u2019s ability to care for their own social independence (by offering \neducation, care and other services) are apparently able to protect against feelings of helplessness, \nlack of protection and finally fear of crime.   \nOne could phrase this distinction in terms of the dichotomy of inclusion vs. exclusion \nwhich has been a prominent theme in the recent literature on social policy (Byrne, 1999; Silver \nand Miller, 2003). In this perspective, welfare measures that help people to participate actively in \nthe educational and employment systems are inclusive while measures which simply replace a \nloss of income or alleviate deprivation through cash transfers do not really prevent exclusion. \nSocially disadvantaged children and families like immigrants, poor and low-educated families, \n 16 \nvery large and single-parent families profit most from universal family services and education \nbecause they enable them to participate in society, to develop cognitive and social skills that lead \nto social inclusion and labor market participation and reduce the future dependency on state \nsupport.  \nGovernments are often frustrated by high levels of public fear of crime. Not only do \npublic insecurities about crime seem to both outweigh the reality of crime. They are also widely \nheld to exert their own negative costs on individuals and communities. Yet our findings are \nconsistent with the idea that public insecurities about crime operate as a compound of broader \nsocial insecurities that are linked to the fundamental social and political conditions of a society. \nPublic insecurities about crime were associated not with the level of crime in a country but rather \nwith the degree of social security provided in a country through its welfare state provision. While \nwe were unable to investigate the mechanisms that link the macro to the micro, we have \nsuggested that self-efficacy may be one key intervening variable.  \nFuture work might explore the idea that those people who feel able to cope with hazards \nand risk situations may be less fearful of crime, and furthermore, the broader provision of social \nsecurity through the welfare state may help partly determine such coping abilities. Such an \nexplanation may drill further into the idea that fear of crime, with all its attendant social \nconsequences, may itself be an expression of public concerns about social security writ large \nacross a society.  \n \n \n \n \n 17 \nNotes \n                                                 \n1 The welfare state does not only limit the market but it also affects the degree to which families absorb social risks (cf. \nthe corresponding concept of \u2018defamilisation\u2019, Esping-Andersen, 1999: 51). \n2 There are countries whose position in the standard typology of welfare states is controversial because they incorporate \nelements from different regime types (for example Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands). But one has to recognize that \ntypologies consist of ideal types in terms of Max Weber. Also Esping-Andersen points out that welfare states cluster \nbut that there is no single pure case (Esping-Andersen 1990, p.28).  \n3 ESSPROS is the European System of integrated Social Protection Statistics developed by Eurostat. It is a harmonized \nsystem providing a means of analyzing and comparing social protection expenditures between states. The data are \navailable at the Eurostat website: http:\/\/epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu. For detailed definitions of the various social \nprotection benefits see ESSPROS Manual 1996, online available: \nhttp:\/\/epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu\/cache\/ITY_OFFPUB\/CA-99-96-641\/EN\/CA-99-96-641-EN.PDF. \n4 We are well aware of the problematic nature of registered crime rates. In cross-national comparative research official \ncrime rates might tell us more about trust in the police, availability of informal conflict resolution strategies or \ninsurance density than about the actual amount of crime in a society. Nevertheless controlling for registered crime rates \nis never a mistake. \n5 See http:\/\/epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu and http:\/\/stats.oecd.org. Most of the data can also be found in published form in \nEurostat (2008) and OECD (2008). \n6 For critical remarks on Esping-Andersen\u2019s decommodification index see e.g. Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, \n1994; Ragin, 1994; Pitruzello, 1999. \n7 Expenditures for employment injuries (in % of total social expenditures) were inversely recoded, then the Z-scores for \nthe three indicators were summed up. \n8 Besides these main variables, we also controlled for further individual characteristics associated with fear of crime. \nHowever, we did not include them in the final model for different reasons (for example because of too much missing \nvalues or the risk of over-specification). In further analyzes which are not reported here we found the already well-\nknown associations: television-consumption and ill health increase fear of crime, while the frequency of meeting other \npeople, the possibility to get help from the private network, higher household income and higher occupational prestige \nlowers fear of crime. Size and composition of the household had no significant effect.  \n9 For this purpose the fear of crime item has been recoded into a dichotomous variable that combines the values 1 and 2 \nas not being fearful and the values 3 and 4 as being fearful. \n10 The D2 and D3 thresholds are the cumulative odds to choose the second or third category, whereas the cumulative \nodds to choose the fourth, highest category (which include all other categories) is by definition 1 and serves as the \nreference category. In this logic, all coefficients estimate the effect to \u2018move down\u2019 from the reference category and \nthus have a positive sign if a predictor decreases fear, and a negative sign if a predictor increases fear. In order to allow \nan intuitive interpretation of our models analogous to standard regression, we decided to recode the dependent variable \nso that 1 is the highest fear level (very unsafe) and 4 is the lowest fear level (very safe). Positive coefficients now \nindicate an increase in fear, while negative coefficients indicate a decrease in fear. \n11 For further reading on gender differences in fear of crime, see Sutton and Farrall 2005. \n12 The same is true for the influence of our two general indicators of the strength of the welfare state: total social \nexpenditure and the index of decommodification. \n 18 \nAcknowledgement \nWe would like to thank Johann Bacher (University of Linz), for discussing the topic and \ncommenting on drafts of this paper. \n 19 \nReferences \nAllmendinger, J.
