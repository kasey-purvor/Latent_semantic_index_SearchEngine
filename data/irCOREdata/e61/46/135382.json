INTRODUCTION\nRESEARCH INTO possible mechanisms of interactionof electromagnetic (EM) fields with biological tissues\nand cells in culture has motivated a growing need for accurate\nmodels describing the EM behavior of cells exposed to these\nfields. Therefore, several numerical models have been created\nin order to study the interaction between EM fields and biolog-\nical entities, at the tissue, cell, and ionic levels. In this area, the\nmost frequently used technique for computing the EM field is\nthe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [1], [2] due\nto its independence from the material parameters.\nThe original FDTD method requires extremely small\ntime-step sizes when modeling electrically small regions (much\nsmaller than a wavelength): this is especially the case when\nmodeling biological cells since they have maximum dimensions\nof a few tens of micrometers. Thus, it can become impractical\ndue to the unaffordable computation times required. This\nproblem can be solved by implementing a quasi-static approxi-\nmate version of FDTD. This approach is based on transferring\nManuscript received August 4, 2006; revised March 24, 2007.\nThe authors are with the Mobile and Satellite Communication Re-\nsearch Centre, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 1DP, U.K. (e-mail:\nc.h.see1@brad.ac.uk; r.a.a.abd@brad.ac.uk; p.s.excell@brad.ac.uk).\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TMTT.2007.904064\nthe working frequency to a higher frequency to reduce the\nnumber of time steps required. The generated internal field at\nthe higher frequency can then be scaled back to the frequency\nof interest [3]\u2013[6].\nCells are surrounded by thin membranes, typically a few\nnanometers thick [7]. They are the major barrier in the cell,\nseparating the inside of the cell from the exterior medium. It\nis this structure that allows cells to selectively interact with\ntheir environment. Therefore, the cell membrane has been\nidentified as the primary target for the study of possible actions\nof EM fields on biological structures. Since the thickness of the\nmembrane is approximately 1000 times smaller than the width\nof a typical biological cell, if the standard FDTD procedure\nwere to be blindly applied to model detail in the membrane\nwithin a complete cell model, this would cause some millions\nof iterations to be required to complete one cycle of simula-\ntion. This again would cause excessive computation time. To\novercome this drawback in standard FDTD, the lumped-ele-\nment FDTD method [8]\u2013[11] was implemented to model the\nbehavior of the membrane. A generic long-established model\n(the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley (HH) model [12]\u2013[16]) was used to\ndemonstrate the functionality of this method: it is known that\nthe HH model is imperfect for microwave frequencies, but it\nis reasonable to use it as a working hypothesis (as have others\n[4]) to develop modeling techniques while operational versions\nof improved models are still in development.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the analyzed structure has been\nrepresented with spherical or cubical cells, and Floquet periodic\nboundary conditions [17]\u2013[20] have been applied to the border\nof the analyzed structure in order to mimic the presence of the\nsurrounding cells. Although cellular tissues are not perfectly pe-\nriodic and living cells are not precisely spheres or cubes, these\napproximations allow a reasonable approach to the modeling of\nbiological tissue using only a small part of the structure, while\nalleviating the problem of the huge requirement of computer re-\nsources for the simulation of a complete body of tissue. Since\nthe external medium of the biological tissue is lossy fluid, the\nmodified Berenger perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing\nboundary condition [21]\u2013[24] is used to truncate the compu-\ntation grid, in order to reduce the reflections on the interface\nlayers: this is more accurate than the Mur boundary condition\n[25], [26] used in other recent work [4].\nA further difficulty is the limited extent of studies on the di-\nelectric properties of cell tissues [27]; thus, the complex per-\nmittivity of each cell tissue is not clearly established for radio\nfrequencies. However, in this study, an analytical method for es-\ntimating the electrical properties of cell tissues in the RF band\n0018-9480\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

Earlier work only\nconsidered two media (water and membrane) [4], but the pro-\ncedure adopted here enables the tissue model to consist of three\nmedia (lossy medium, membrane, and cytoplasm). In addition,\na mass of connected biological tissue is simulated by creating\nan equivalent stack of compacted cells (both spherical, with in-\nterstices, and fully compacted cubical). The total electric fields\nalong the central axes of rows of these spherical and cubical cel-\nlular structures will be investigated.\nII. SUMMARY OF METHOD\nA. Quasi-Static FDTD Scheme\nThe interaction between animals and humans exposed to ex-\ntremely low-frequency electric fields was investigated by Kaune\nand Gillis [29] and Guy et al. [30] in 1981 and 1982, respec-\ntively. Their research results furnish valuable analytical and ex-\nperimental verification of the concept of quasi-static coupling\nat power-line frequencies. Later authors [5], [6], [31] imple-\nmented the same principles using FDTD to study the numerical\ndosimetry of anatomically based models. Recently, the same\nidea was further extended to modeling the interaction between\nEM fields and biological tissue at mobile communication fre-\nquencies, i.e., GSM900 and GSM1800 [4].\nIn order to implement the quasi-static approximation to ana-\nlyze scattering problems, the maximum dimension of the struc-\nture under investigation must be less than approximately one-\ntenth of the wavelength in the surrounding medium [29], [30].\nAccording to the scaling relationship between the fields at fre-\nquencies and that was derived in [5] and [30], a higher\nworking frequency that still falls within the quasi-static\nregime can be chosen to excite the model to reduce the com-\nputation time.\nB. Modified Berenger PML\nThe PML, introduced by Berenger [21] in 1994, allowed\nboundary reflections below 80 dB to be realized. The PML is\nbased on surrounding the FDTD problem space with a highly\nlossy and matched nonphysical absorber. It has been found\nto be the most accurate technique of the absorbing boundary\nconditions available and has become standard in most current\nFDTD implementations [32]. For the case of PML layers with\nconductivities increasing geometrically, the geometric grading\nfactor ( ) can be modified in order to reduce the reflection on\nthe interface layer when the problem space is entirely within\na lossy-medium environment. An empirical expression from\nwhich can be found, and which has been found to give good\nresults [23], [24] is\n(1)\nwhere is the spatial increment of the FDTD mesh, is\nthe normal reflection coefficient, is the number of the cells\nin the PML thickness, and is the velocity of EM waves in the\nenvironment concerned.\nC. Floquet Periodic Boundary Condition\nMany structures of EM interest are electrically very large and,\nhence, pose great difficulties for computational simulation. One\napproach that can be used to reduce the size of the computational\ntask is to exploit any periodicity in the structure in one or more\ndimensions: this concept will be exploited here, assuming that\na sample of tissue is formed from a periodic grid of biological\ncells. In order to perform EM analysis on these types of structure\nwith reasonable computational time, the structures are assumed\nto be an infinite grid and the problem can then be reduced to a\nunit-cell analysis via use of the Floquet boundary condition to\nsimulate the effect of the periodic replication.\nThe FDTD technique was applied to the basic structure due\nto its simplicity and flexibility. FDTD has already been success-\nfully extended to incorporate the Floquet theorem for the case\nof normal [17], [33] and oblique incidence [34], [35] for 2-D\nand 3-D problems. The techniques used to combine FDTD with\nthe Floquet periodic boundary condition can be classified into\ntwo categories, i.e., direct field methods and field transforma-\ntion methods [2].\nD. Lumped-Element Membrane Model\nCells are surrounded by a thin membrane, which is the major\nbarrier separating the cell from its environment (normally a\nliquid). Since the cell needs to get nutrients in and waste out,\nthe membrane must be able to accommodate this. Therefore,\nthe membrane has to act as a selective barrier, allowing nutri-\nents to pass in, but keeping out many substances harmful to\nthe cell, and acting as a dynamic barrier medium, constantly\nadapting to changing environmental conditions (e.g., different\nconcentrations of ions).\nThe dimensions of a biological cell are around a few tens of\nmicrometers and the thicknesses of the membranes are in the\nscale of a few nanometers, strongly depending on the type of the\ntissue. Depending on the type of the cell, voltages in the range of\n20\u2013200 mV can arise across the membrane. When the cell is in\na resting state, the current across the membrane averages zero,\nbut more generally, it depends on the variation of the membrane\nvoltage [12].\nHodgkin and Huxley gave a general description of the time\ncourse of the current that flows through the membrane of the\nsquid giant axon when the potential difference across the mem-\nbrane was suddenly changed from its steady state. The results in\n[12] suggest that the behavior of membrane may be represented\nby an electric circuit [4], [12]. Current can be carried through\nthe membrane either by charging the membrane capacitance or\nby movement of ions through the nonlinear conductance in par-\nallel with the membrane capacitance. A set of equations gov-\nerning the model is given in [4] and [12].\nIII. IMPLEMENTATION AND VALIDATION\nA. Lumped-Element Model Implementation\nTo verify the correctness of the implementation of the HH\nmodel within the FDTD framework, the results of the analyt-\nically computed solution have been used for comparison.

Field distribution in and around a single isolated cell.\nHH model was implemented on a spherical structure with di-\nameter of 50 m and discretized with 1- m steps in order to\ncheck for the expected polarization voltage of 60.27 mV on\nthe membrane [4]. The HH model was included on the sur-\nface of the cell, while the regions internal and external to the\nsphere were considered as cytoplasm and lossy medium, re-\nspectively. It should be noted that the lumped-element FDTD\nmethod has been successfully modified in order to allow ar-\nbitrary positioning of lumped elements inside FDTD elements\nrepresenting the membrane, not necessarily aligned with the\nFDTD grid [4], so that they represent the structure more ex-\nactly than simple FDTD. Fig. 1 depicts the expected polarization\nvoltage of 60.27 mV appearing on the membrane of the spher-\nical structure without any external excitation.\nB. Quasi-Static FDTD Validation\nHere, a simple example will be given to illustrate this\nmethod: the results will be compared with the Mie series\nanalytical solution [36], [37]. A two-layer sphere simulating\na biological cell inside a lossy medium was considered for\nwhich the assumed properties were as follows [38]: cyto-\nplasm (internal) , S\/m; membrane\n, S\/m; external lossy medium ,\nS\/m. The radius of the internal region was 25 m\nand the membrane thickness was set to 2 m. The operating\nfrequency was 2.45 GHz, whereas the interim transformed\nfrequency used in this example was 30 GHz. From (1), the\noptimum grading factor is 6.07 for an FDTD cell size of 1 m.\nIt should be noted that this model in the FDTD computation\ndomain is excited by a standard plane wave of amplitude 1 V\/m,\npropagating in the -direction and polarized in the -direction.\nThe field distributions along the two central axes of the layered\ncell are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3. As can be seen, the numerical\nresults are in good agreement with the analytical ones. It should\nFig. 2.

Electric field (E ) distribution along the x-axis for double-layer sphere\nin lossy medium, excited by plane wave of 1 V\/m at 2450 GHz.\nbe noted that the method was executed for a total time equal to\nfour cycles.\nC. Implementation of Floquet Boundary Condition\nThe implementation of Floquet boundary conditions, quasi-\nstatic FDTD, and the current modified PML for a lossy medium\nexcited by a 100-V\/m plane wave at an operating frequency of\n900 MHz is demonstrated here. The lossy medium properties\nwere and S\/m. The problem space and cell\nsizes were 21 21 121 and 10 m, respectively. The Floquet\nboundary conditions were imposed on four sides of the lossy\nmedium. The remaining two sides were each terminated by a\nPML of six cells. The analyses were performed at 10, 15, and\n20 GHz and then transferred back to the desired operating fre-\nquency of 900 MHz. As can be observed in Fig. 4, the analytical\nand computed results are in good agreement.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

SIMULATION AND RESULTS\nA. Connected Tissue Model Using Spherical Cells\nA stack of ten spherical cells was investigated, as shown in\nFigs. 5 and 6. The radius of the each cell was 10 m. The model\ncontained three media, cytoplasm, membrane, and extracellular\nmedium, and the dielectric properties of these were obtained\nfrom [28], as tabulated in Table I. A plane wave of 100 V\/m\npropagating in the -direction and polarized in the -direction\nwas used as the excitation. Note that the incident plane wave\nexcitation was applied on a plane lying between the PML re-\ngion and the outer limit of the FDTD grid. In addition, in order\nto reduce high-frequency transients [39], [40] and dc offsets\n[41], [42] sometimes associated with unramped sine-wave exci-\ntations, the ramped sinusoidal source in (2) was adopted, multi-\nplying the excitation source of 100 V\/m with the functions\ngiven [41]\n(2)\nFig. 6. 3-D view of the basic simulated spherical structures in the FDTD com-\nputational domain.\nTABLE I\nELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SIMULATED MEDIA\nAT RELEVANT FREQUENCIES\nwhere is the duration of the ramped cosine regime, which is\napproximately three source cycles.\nThe PML, shown in Fig. 6, was six FDTD elements wide, the\ngrading factor was 10.1383, and the grid structure was effec-\ntively extended to infinity in the - and -directions by imposing\nthe Floquet boundary condition along the - and -axes. The\nFloquet periodic boundary condition plays an important role to\nmimic the presence of an extended 3-D structure of biological\ncells, simulating connected tissue. This can be easily imagined\nin two dimensions, as shown in Fig. 5. The FDTD problem space\nwas 220 20 20 FDTD elements of size 1 m, while a dis-\ncretization time step of 1.3 fs was chosen to drive the FDTD\ncomputation to meet the requirements of the Courant stability\ncriterion.\nBefore implementing the HH lumped-element model into the\nsimulated structure, the effect of moving the Floquet boundaries\ngradually away from the simulated structure was studied. Figs. 7\nand 8 depict the field distribution through the center of the sim-\nulated structure at 10 GHz with varying locations of the Floquet\nboundaries, where is the number of FDTD elements be-\ntween the Floquet boundaries and the boundaries of the biolog-\nical cells, in the - and -directions.

When the Floquet boundaries are exactly adjacent\nto the simulated structure , the strongest coupling\neffect between cells can be obtained: the highest induced field\non the membrane and lowest induced field in the cytoplasm of\nthe cell can be observed.

The distributions of the\nelectric field through the center of the simulated structure,\nalong the incident wave propagation direction at 900, 1800,\n2000, and 2450 MHz, are given in Figs. 11 and 12, where\nFig. 12 is an enlarged version of Fig. 11. From inspection of\nFig. 12, the field inside the cells is not constant and the induced\nfield intensity is directly proportional to the frequency. In the\nother words, the higher the operating frequency used to excite\nthe model, the higher the electric field intensity that will be\ninduced within the analyzed structures.\nTo complete the simulation, the HH models were embedded\nin the surface of the spherical cells, in a direction normal to the\nsurface, to represent the membrane effect of the tissue model.\nVersions including this were studied at frequencies of 900 and\n2450 MHz. As can be seen in Figs. 13 and 14, there is a dif-\nference of approximately 15% in the field strength due to the\ncontribution of the membrane effect from the HH model: these\nvariations were in good agreement with expectations [4], [12],\n[28].\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Bradford.

Same as Fig. 19, driven at 2450 MHz.\ninvestigated, as shown in Figs. 19 and 20. The effect of adding\nthis model is approximately 15% difference in field, as can be\nseen from these figures.\nThe peak field on the membrane of the cubical structure is\nobserved to be approximately three times higher than in the cy-\ntoplasm, which agrees well with the results from the structure\nbased on spherical cells. However, the absolute field strength\nis approximately doubled in the spherical-cell case, presumably\nbecause of the curvature at the points studied: it is to be expected\nthat much higher fields would be observed at the corners of the\ncubical cells, but it might be argued that, as a localized matter,\nthese points do not correspond well with biological reality.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAn approach to microdosimetric modeling of bioelectromag-\nnetic interactions at the cellular level has been presented. This\nuses the FDTD method, combined with an arbitrarily oriented\nimplementation of a generic lumped-element (HH) cell-mem-\nbrane model and the Floquet periodic boundary condition. By\nimplementing a frequency-scaling approach, the number of\nFDTD time steps for such an electrically small structure can be\nreduced from several millions to a few tens of thousands. The\nreflection on the interface layers inside the FDTD computation\ndomain has also been successfully reduced, even though it is\nwithin lossy penetrable media, by using a modified version of\nBerenger\u2019s absorbing boundary condition. The accuracy of the\nFDTD scaling approach was verified with idealized models of\nspherical cells in lossy media. The feasibility of the inclusion\nof the lumped-element model inside the FDTD computation\ndomain was demonstrated. This leads to the conclusion that the\napplication of such models allows cells of arbitrary geometries\nto be handled and demonstrates the viability of embedding other\ntypes of lumped-element model for membrane behavior, which\nis desirable since the HH model is imperfect for microwave\nfrequencies, although it is reasonable to use it as a working\nhypothesis [4] to develop modeling techniques.\nUse of the Floquet boundary condition enables a nontrivial\nregion of connected biological tissue to be simulated. Such a\ntool will facilitate deeper investigation of the phenomena in the\ninteraction between EM fields and biological systems at var-\nious levels of spatial definition. The combination of quasi-static\nFDTD with an arbitrarily oriented lumped-element membrane\nmodel, the modified Berenger absorbing boundary condition,\nand the Floquet periodic boundary condition represents a sig-\nnificant advance in verisimilitude of biological cell modeling.\nREFERENCES\n[1] K.
