The SuperDARN chain of oblique HF radars has\nprovided an opportunity to generate a unique climatology of\nhorizontal winds near the mesopause at a number of high lat-\nitude locations, via the Doppler shifted echoes from sources\nof ionisation in the D-region. Ablating meteor trails form the\nbulk of these targets, but other phenomena also contribute to\nthe observations. Due to the poor vertical resolution of the\nradars, care must be taken to reduce possible biases from\nsporadic-E layers and Polar Mesospheric Summer echoes\nthat can affect the effective altitude of the geophysical pa-\nrameters being observed. Second, there is strong theoreti-\ncal and observational evidence to suggest that the radars are\npicking up echoes from the backward looking direction that\nwill tend to reduce the measured wind strengths. The effect is\nstrongly frequency dependent, resulting in a 20% reduction\nat 12 MHz and a 50% reduction at 10 MHz.\nA comparison of the climatologies observed by the Super-\nDARN Finland radar between September 1999 and Septem-\nber 2000 and that obtained from the adjacent VHF meteor\nradar located at Kiruna is also presented. The agreement be-\ntween the two instruments was very good. Extending the\nanalysis to the SuperDARN Iceland East radar indicated that\nthe principles outlined above could be applied successfully\nto the rest of the SuperDARN network.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionosphere-atmosphere interac-\ntions; instruments and techniques) \u2013 Meteorology and atmo-\nspheric dynamics (waves and tides)\n1 Introduction\nThe upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere region pro-\nvides a natural demarcation between the essentially neu-\ntrally charged lower atmosphere and the strongly plasma in-\nfluenced upper atmosphere (see, for example, Rees, 1989).\nLimitations in computing power traditionally confined cli-\nmate models to the troposphere and occasionally the lower\nCorrespondence to: N. F.

A natural continuation of this trend is to con-\nsider the dynamical impact of the lower thermosphere on the\natmosphere below and vice versa.\nIt has been suggested that solar-induced changes in the\nthermosphere may bring about significant modifications to\nthe circulation of the stratosphere via wave transport pro-\ncesses (Arnold and Robinson, 1998, 2000). Much of the\nlarge-scale observational information on winds in the up-\nper mesosphere and lower thermosphere has come from two\ninstruments on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite\n(McLandress et al., 1996; Fleming et al., 1996). Their geo-\ngraphical coverage was restricted to a maximum of 75\u25e6 north\nand south of the equator. Satellites can only take a couple of\nsamples per day at any location and if the satellite precesses\nin orbit these measurements will have different local times.\nHigh levels of natural variability from tides, planetary waves,\ngravity waves and turbulence, in addition to experimental er-\nror, placed constraints on the quality of the data.\nThere have been many studies of the winds in the up-\nper mesosphere and lower thermosphere by individual radars\n(see, for example, Ro\u00a8ttger and Vincent, 1996 for a review).\nCombining these observations can produce difficulties be-\ncause of the large differences between the observational tech-\nniques being employed. The Super Dual Auroral Radar Net-\nwork (SuperDARN) was constructed and operated to mea-\nsure large-scale ionospheric convection flows at high lati-\ntudes (Greenwald et al., 1995). Hall et al. (1997) recognised\nthat at HF frequencies, these radars were also very effective\nat measuring meteor echoes. The Doppler shifts from meteor\ntrails have long been used to infer the neutral winds in the\nupper atmosphere (Greenhow, 1952; Robertson et al., 1953;\nGreenhow and Neufeld, 1955). Hussey et al. (2000) demon-\nstrated that the SuperDARN chain of HF radars provides a\nvaluable facility to observe the evolution of large-scale dy-\nnamical processes over both short and long periods of time\n2074 N.

The\nangles of the 3 db gain reductions are denoted by dashed lines and\nthe largest side lobe by a dashed \u2013 dotted line.\nin the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere.\nMost purpose-built meteor radars operate at frequencies\nabove 30 MHz (see, for example, Hocking, 1997) to min-\nimise contamination from other ionospheric sources and\nground-scatter. The approach adopted by Hall et al. (1997)\nfor observations with the HF radars was to reject echo returns\nfrom beyond the fifth range gate (360 km from the radar)\nand a Doppler velocity greater than \u00b1200 ms\u22121. The spec-\ntral width parameter was found to be related to the ambi-\npolar diffusion which is itself strongly related to atmospheric\ntemperature, pressure and the neutral-ion collision frequency\n(see, for example, Arnold et al., 2001). This criterion pro-\nvided qualitatively reasonable results. However, there are\noccasions when more rigorous criteria need to be applied.\nNot all radar echoes that fall within the criteria adopted\nby Hall et al. are in fact meteors. Recent work by Ogawa\net al. (2002) and Kelley et al. (2002) has strongly suggested\nthat the first few range gates of the HF radars are capable of\ndetecting Polar Mesospheric Summer Echoes. These insta-\nbilities have low spectral widths and occur within the meteor\nlayer. However, ions and electrons in this region are closely\ncoupled to the neutral gas and so they will allow for a deter-\nmination of the neutral winds to be made in the same way as\nthe meteors, albeit with different echo characteristics.\nIn this paper, we shall present examples of systematic bi-\nases within the SuperDARN radars and ionospheric contam-\nination of the returns that need to be taken into account. The\ndeployment of a dedicated VHF meteor radar close to the\nFinland element of this network allowed for a detailed inter-\ncomparison to be conducted over a full year and demon-\nstrated that with the appropriate level of quality control, good\nagreement between the two systems could be obtained. Fur-\nther improvements to the D-region observing capability re-\nlated to new hardware developments with the CUTLASS pair\nof SuperDARN radars will be discussed at the end of the pa-\nper.\n2 Description of the radar systems\nThe CUTLASS pair of radars used in this study form part of\nthe SuperDARN chain. The CUTLASS HF radars consist\nof 16 identical antennae and 4 interferometers with trans-\nmit\/receive capability between 8\u201320 MHz (see, for exam-\nple, Milan et al., 1997). The Finland radar at Hankasalmi\nhas been operational since February 1995, while the one at\nPykkvibaer in Iceland commenced in November of the same\nyear. Each beam is approximately 3 degrees wide and can\nbe made to point to 16 adjacent volumes of space through\nelectronic changes to the phasing. A typical scan will sweep\nthrough these elements, integrating the return signal from\n30 ms pulse sequences over a period of 3, or more normally,\n7 s. Real time processing of the incoming signals allows for\nthe retrieval of the return power Doppler shifted velocity and\nspectral width, along with other parameters, such as the ele-\nvation angle of the echo. The data are ascribed to 75 range\ngates with a resolution of 15, 30 or 45 km, and the distance\nto the first range can also be varied according to the nature\nof the experiment. The \u201ccommon programme\u201d mode, which\naccounted for at least half of the days each month, has a first\nrange of 180 km and a resolution of 45 km.\nThe gain sensitivities of the radar transmitters as a func-\ntion of elevation angle at 10 MHz and 12 MHz have been\nmodelled (Fig. 1). The transmit and receive patterns are iden-\ntical, so the total power variation in decibels is obtained by\ndoubling the values plotted. The forward looking direction\nof the transmitters is on the right-hand side of the plots. The\noptimum angle at 10 MHz was calculated to be around 26 de-\ngrees. Observed meteor echo strengths could exceed 30 dB\nabove the \u201cnoise\u201d threshold, so returns were to be expected\nover a wide range of viewing angles. In principle, meteors\ncould be detected from vertical incidence at 10 MHz and par-\nticularly at 12 MHz, but with a first range of 180 km, these\nmeteors will not be retrieved in the standard mode of opera-\ntion.\nThere is a prominent backward lobe at 10 MHz, which is\nweaker at 12 MHz. As the take-off angle is comparable to\nthe forward lobe, there is no simple way of discriminating\nbetween the two directions, for example, by comparing the\nelevation angles from the interferometer. A bright meteor\ntravelling south from the reverse lobe will be indistinguish-\nable from a weaker meteor travelling north from the forward\nlooking direction.

Under\nthese circumstances, two distinct populations will be formed\nby their differing geometries. E-region contamination from\nthis mode will be kept to a minimum by a number of factors.\nThe reduction in the gain sensitivity at the zenith at 10 MHz\nis 30 dB (transmit and receive), but is much lower at 12 MHz\n(12 dB). Ionospheric scatter from diffuse irregularities tend\nnot to be as intense as meteor trails, so most echoes will\nbe below the noise threshold of the radar. Also, most iono-\nspheric echoes in the F-layer tend to have spectral widths that\ngreatly exceed 50 ms\u22121. Finally, a significant fraction of the\nF-region ionospheric returns congregate in patches that have\ncoherent temporal and spatial structure that can be identified\nby the processing software and will be discussed in the next\nsection.\nThe interferometer is accurate to a few degrees only, so in\ncombination with a range gate of 15 km, it cannot be used\nto determine the altitude of the meteor echoes to better than\napproximately 10 km. This is sufficient, however, to assess\nthe extent to which the data is coming from the D- or the\nE-region. An intercomparison with the Saskatoon MF radar\nindicated that the average height was around 95 km (Hall et\nal., 1997). Using the range gate and the interferometer, es-\ntimates of velocity at 3-km height intervals were provided,\nbut the effective resolution was still 10\u201315 km (Hussey et al.,\n2000). Hall et al. (1997) first suggested the use of spectral\nwidth information to estimate the mean height of the mea-\nsurements, as this quantity is related to the ambipolar diffu-\nsion rate of the meteor trail. Arnold et al. (2001) demon-\nstrated that the spectral width parameter provided consider-\nable information about the response of the meteor layer to\nchanging atmospheric conditions. Higher horizontal reso-\nlution in the range gates from 45 to 15 km should improve\nmatters during special meteor observing campaigns, but the\nnumber of days when the radars could operate in this mode\nwould be limited to only a few days per month (Hussey et al.,\n2000).\nAt HF wavelengths, it is technically very difficult to con-\nstruct a narrow beam that illuminates a small volume of the\nsky. As the SuperDARN radars operate over a range of fre-\nquencies, complex beam patterns are generated, especially\naway from the optimum operating frequency. Most of the\nradars operate at 12 MHz, but to improve the number of\nionospheric returns, the CUTLASS radars have often used\n10 MHz.\nThe VHF meteor radar at the Esrange rocket range in\nKiruna, Sweden, was deployed in the summer of 1999 and\na nearly continuous data set has been generated since August\nof that year to the present, with only a few significant gaps at\nthe beginning of its operation. It consists of a single dipole-\ntype transmitter with nearly uniform all-sky sensitivity and\n5 receiver antennae. The radar operates at a frequency of\n32.5 MHz. At this frequency the all-radio waves will travel\nthrough the lower ionosphere in an essentially straight line\nand only return to the radar if they encounter a suitable tar-\nget. At further meteor ranges ground-backscatter following\nreflection from the E-layer can be a factor at lower HF fre-\nquencies. The all-sky beam pattern relies on interferome-\ntry to determine the azimuth, elevation and altitude of the\nechoes. The elevation angle can be measured to within 1\u20132\u25e6\n(Hocking 1999) and in conjunction with a suitable gating of\nthe incoming signal translates to a vertical resolution better\nthan 2 km, which is considerably better than that which is\npossible with the oblique HF radars. The effective fields-of-\nview of the Esrange and Finland radars were separated by a\nhundred kilometres (Fig. 2), but this will be shown to be suf-\nficiently small enough to allow for the gross features in the\n2076 N.

Although the area illuminated by the\nCUTLASS radar is smaller, the higher sensitivity of the latter\nsystem and the increase in echoes at lower frequencies (see,\nfor example, McKinley, 1961) result in significantly higher\nreturns (Fig. 3) for the HF radar. One important source of\nechoes will be targets that have been incorrectly identified\nas meteors but have other ionospheric origins. There was a\nnoticeable increase in the number of echoes from the CUT-\nLASS radar part way through the study interval. This transi-\ntion is due to the implementation of a 3-s integration time for\napproximately 30% of the Common Time operations. When\nthe density of meteor returns was relatively large, multiple\nechoes could occur within an integration period and so a pro-\nportion of these could now be isolated; also the sampling rate\nwas higher.\n3 Treatment of non-meteor data in the nearest range\ngates\nThe operating frequencies of the CUTLASS Finland radar\nduring common programme operations in 1999 and 2000\nwere chosen to be 12 MHz between 06:00 and 18:00 UT and\n10 MHz at all other times, to detect the greatest number of\nionospheric echoes. The nearest six ranges were cluttered\nwith returns from many different sources. Often these have\neither broad spectral widths or large velocities or both, and\nprovide a straightforward criterion for rejecting non-meteor\ndata. Ionospheric echoes of non-meteor origins can have\nspectral widths of up to 1000 ms\u22121. In Arnold et al. (2001)\nthe limits were set at \u00b150 ms\u22121 for the line-of-sight veloci-\nties and 50 ms\u22121 for the spectral width. However, there re-\n(a)\n(b)\nFinland Power\nFinland Power\nFig. 4.

Outside the au-\nroral oval, they are predominantly summer phenomena and\nare especially prevalent in the daytime. During intense ge-\nomagnetic activity, sporadic-E can be seen at night due to\nincreased precipitation of electrons from the solar wind (see,\nfor example, Weber et al., 1977).\nThe ionised layer consists of metal ions that have origi-\nnated from meteor ablation and drifted upwards (for a re-\nview, see Kopp, 1997). As the radar targets are layers rather\nthan free moving ions, they naturally have low velocities and\nnarrow spectral widths. Local time variations of returned\npower from a single beam and range gate on two separate\ndays in early November illustrate the difference between the\nmeteor (Fig. 4a) and sporadic-E (Fig. 4b) echoes, respec-\ntively. In contrast to the grainy, quasi-random distribution\nof location and power of the meteors described by Hall et\nal. (1997), sporadic-E returns tend to be highly coherent over\na long period of time, in addition to taking up a large area (up\nto hundreds of kilometres) and being of considerable signal\nstrength. There will be meteor echoes present in the sporadic\nN. F. Arnold et al.: Comparison of D-region Doppler drift winds 2077\nlayer data that may account for some of the variability in the\nsignal power. A detailed analysis of the raw autocorrelation\nfunctions would be needed for any attempt to extract the su-\nperimposed meteor information and this is beyond the scope\nof this study.\nSometimes, sporadic-E occupies the entire field of view\nover many hours, in which case it is relatively easy to iden-\ntify and reject the data automatically. However, more typi-\ncally, there is only partial coverage \u2013 usually at the further\nranges, while there are potentially useable meteor echoes at\nthe nearer ranges. More elaborate retrieval algorithms would\nbe needed to handle these situations. For the purposes of this\npaper, we have adopted a simple statistical approach. Where\nthe mean power of returned echoes in a particular hour ex-\nceeded a particular threshold, that hour was rejected. An\nexamination of mean back-scattered power as a function of\nlocal time and season indicated that any hourly data that ex-\nceeded a threshold of 24 dB was likely to be contaminated.\nFurther refinement of the procedure could take account of\nthe orientation of the Earth with respect to the trajectory of\nincoming meteors. This results in a strong diurnal cycle in\nback-scatter power, so it should be possible to generate a\nthreshold that takes account of temporal variations in meteor\nstrength.\nIn addition to backscatter power filtering, it is possible to\ndiscriminate between different echo generation mechanisms\nby considering the spectral width profile. This parameter\nis closely related to the ambipolar diffusion rate (Hall et\nal., 1997; Arnold et al., 2001) and within the meteor layer\nshould have mean values of between 10\u201325 ms\u22121. However,\nE-region irregularities can also exhibit a spectral width dis-\ntribution in this range.\nFigure 5 shows the spectral width distributions at 13 MHz\nas a function of range during a special experimental cam-\npaign run on 8 July 1999 and again three days later on 11 July\n1999. During this experiment, the first range gate was set to\n60 km and the gates were separated by 15 km. At 13 MHz,\necho returns could be attributed to a small contribution from\nthe upward looking lobe, so that meteors at different ranges\nfrom the radar could be inferred. The gain-elevation charac-\nteristics of the radar at 13 MHz are such that the almost ver-\ntically pointing second peak has moved further away from\nthe zenith than for the 12 MHz trace in Fig. 1b, so a range of\n110 km remained consistent with observations of the meteor\nlayer. On the uncontaminated day, (Fig. 5a) the smooth fall\noff of meteor echoes beyond 240 km indicated that the fur-\nthest useful range was around 400\u2013450 km, which is equiva-\nlent to the seventh range gate in the common mode where the\nfirst range was 180 km and the resolution was 45 km. This is\nan improvement on the cutoff point of 360 km that has been\nused in previous studies (e.g. Hall et al., 1997; Arnold et al.,\n2001). Similarly, spectral widths below 40 ms\u22121 were likely\nto be related to meteor activity.\nOn the 11th, the maximum count rate was around 40\noccurrences per range gate per unit spectral width interval\nper day. Contrast this with the situation three days earlier\n(Fig. 5b) when there was a considerable enhancement at a\nNumber of \nOccurrences\nNumber of \nOccurrences\nSpectral width distribution 13 MHz 8\/7\/99\nSpectral width distribution 13 MHz 11\/7\/99\n(a)\n(b)\n36\n6\n12\n18\n24\n30\nSp\ne\nct\nra\nl w\nid\nth\n,\n \nm\n\/s\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nRange, km\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nRange, km\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nSp\ne\nct\nra\nl w\nid\nth\n,\n \nm\n\/s\nSpectral width distribution 13 MHz 8\/7\/99\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\nFig. 5.

To accommodate this change in occurrence\nrates, it was necessary to rescale the contours by more than a\nfactor of three.

The technique\nis most useful during the summer months when the meteor\ncount, PMSE and also the E-layer reflections are abundant.\nTo examine the annual cycle in the mean spectral width\nand whether the summer months were especially anoma-\nlous, this parameter was binned according to season and\nlocal time from the CUTLASS Finland radar at 10 and\n12 MHz, for the period September 1999 to August 2000,\nwhen the first six range gates were considered together. In\nthe months of November and March the mean spectral widths\nat 12 MHz were dominated by very low value returns asso-\nciated with ionospheric layer contamination. Reducing the\nfurthest range gate to within 270 km removed much of this\nproblem, but at the expense of rejecting ten months of good\ndata at the furthest ranges and a number of satisfactory days\nfor the bad months.\nAs an alternative approach anomalous data were re-\njected by requiring the mean spectral width to be between\n16\u201324 ms\u22121 and also that the average power remained be-\nlow 30 dB, and the remaining spectral width data were to be\nbinned as before.

Note\nalso a semiannual variation in the spectral width distribution\nthat may be attributed to changes in the D-region temperature\n(Arnold et al., 2001).\n4 Backward lobe correction\nFrom Fig. 1, it was clear that the CUTLASS radars oper-\nating at 10 MHz and to a lesser extent, at 12 MHz, would\ndetect meteor echoes originating from \u201cbehind the radar\u201d.\nAny time-averaged winds would have a component along the\nbeam that is perceived to be travelling in the opposing direc-\ntion to the flow. If the meteor distribution was isotropic and\nthe gain sensitivities between the front and back lobes were\nidentical, then the radar would not be able to observe a net\nflow in either direction. Fortunately, the rear lobe signal is\nover 10 dB weaker than the front lobe, but with meteor echo\nstrengths above 20 dB not uncommon, that still leaves a large\nnumber of undesirable signals.\nDuring the summer, in the hours just after midnight, the\nreturn power of the meteors is strongest. At this time, a min-\nimum return power threshold of 20 dB does not significantly\naffect the ratio of front to back echoes. However, during the\nafternoon and in the winter season, the echoes become much\nweaker and the population of return echoes from behind di-\nminishes considerably. Therefore, the measured velocity was\ncloser to the true velocity.\nUse was made of the return power variation of meteor\nechoes as a function of local time, season and operating fre-\nquency. To obtain a data set that consisted entirely of 10 MHz\nreturns, 1997 was selected. During the interval 1999\u20132000,\nthere were sufficient days in each month operating continu-\nously at 12 MHz to generate a comparable climatology.\nBeams 5\u201310 were selected to measure the meridional\nwinds, as these could be obtained without modifying the line-\nof-sight observations.

The lines are average values for\nthe first six range gates of the common programme.\nties for each hour of local time were determined for each of\nthe six nearest range gates by assuming that the vertical ve-\nlocity component was zero and the mean meteor altitude was\n95 km (see, for example, Arnold et al., 2001). The proce-\ndure was repeated with a minimum power threshold of 20 dB\napplied. As the average signal strength diminished in the\nday-time and during the winter, so too did the probability of\ndetecting a meteor echo from behind the radar \u2013 much more\nso than for the forward looking lobe. The extent of back lobe\ncontamination of the data could be determined by compar-\ning the relative difference in the magnitude of the meridional\nwinds between using the high power echoes only and using\nall of the available data, at both 10 and 12 MHz. There was a\ndistinct peak at 19:00 UT in the 10 MHz case, where the am-\nplitude of the meridional wind increased by approximately\n40\u201350% (Fig. 8). The enhancement in the amplitude was\nfound to be only 20% at 12 MHz, as the influence of the rear\nlobe was weaker.\nSmall increases in the frequency above 12 MHz would\nbring the attenuating factor closer to zero, suggesting that\n13\u201315 MHz would produce purer velocity measurements.\nHowever, the number of observed meteor echoes decreases\nrapidly with frequency, making the determination of mean\nwind speeds more difficult (McKinley, 1961). Twelve MHz\nrepresents a good compromise at times when the meteor\ncount was high and 10 MHz would be preferable at other\ntimes.\n5 Comparison with the VHF meteor radar\nInitially, all data from the Kiruna VHF meteor radar between\n88 and 104 km were used to derive the local time and sea-\nsonal variability of the meridional winds between Septem-\n0\n10\n20\n30\n-10\n-20\n-30\n0\n10\n20\n30\n-10\n-20\n-30\nCUTLASS Finland beams 6-10\nKiruna Meteor Radar - Southern Quadrant\nJ\nD\nO\nS\nA\nJ\nJ\nA\nF\nJ\nJ\nD\nN\nO\nS\nA\nJ\nJ\nM\nA\nM\nF\nJ\nM\no\nn\nth\nM\no\nn\nth\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22\nUniversal Time\nUniversal Time\nV, m\/s\nV, m\/s\n(b)\n(a)\nN\nM\nM\n24\nFig. 9.

The radar interferometer pro-\nvided an accurate determination of the elevation and azimuth\nof each individual meteor, which with the Doppler line-of-\nsight velocity then contributed to a statistical fit to obtain the\nbest hourly zonal and meridional wind speeds. (It is assumed\nthat the vertical velocity component is zero.) Note that the lo-\ncation of the meteors collected by the SuperDARN radar is\ndetermined by assuming that it is coming from a particular\nbeam and range gate cell. Agreement with the SuperDARN\nFinland HF was quite good, but it was found that there were\nsignificant latitudinal variations over the VHF radar field of\nview. To reduce the geographical differences between the\ntwo radars, only data from between the Southeast and South-\nwest of Kiruna were used in the comparison (Fig. 9). The\nCUTLASS data were processed to reduce E-layer biases, but\nthe rear-lobe contamination was left uncorrected. Beams six\nto ten of the CUTLASS radar were selected as they looked\nessentially northward and described a segment of 15 degrees.\nOnly line-of-sight velocities were used, so there would be a\nminor contribution from the zonal wind component for the\noff-meridional beams. Assuming that the meteor height was\nfixed at 97 km, the horizontal component of the wind at each\nrange gate could be inferred (Arnold et al., 2001). The best\n2080 N. F.

Agreement was qualitatively\nreasonable at other local times but the wind speed was lower\nfor the HF data. The correction factor of around 50% as de-\nscribed in the preceding section would account for much of\nthis difference.\nThe statistical variance between the Kiruna and CUT-\nLASS radars was computed from the mean of the squares\nof the differences at each element of the climatological grid\nshown in Fig. 9 \u2013 namely for each hour of Universal Time\nand the month of the year. It was found to be less than\nthat between the north and south centred quadrants of the\nVHF radar, suggesting that a significant fraction of the re-\nmaining discrepancy was attributable to geographical varia-\ntions rather than experimental errors. Note also a few points\naround 19:00 UT in April in the HF data where several lo-\ncal maxima were located. The criterion for rejecting poten-\ntially contaminated data did not make any allowance for sea-\nsonal variability in the mean power of the meteor backscat-\nter returns. Therefore, during the solstices, it was likely that\n\u201cgood\u201d meteor days were more likely to be rejected than dur-\ning the equinox. A more detailed model of meteor character-\nistics will take this into account in the future.\n6 Comparison between the CUTLASS Finland and\nCUTLASS Iceland radars\nThe two radars that comprise the CUTLASS element of the\nSuperDARN chain are virtually identical in their construc-\ntion and performance. Most of the differences between their\nrespective wind climatologies will be due to geographical\nvariations in either the horizontal winds, the ionospheric con-\ntamination, or to explicit changes to the operating modes of\nthe two radars. The Iceland radar is much more likely to be\nlocated within the auroral oval than its Finland counterpart\nand so will experience different contamination conditions.\nAlso, there is a three-hour lag in the minimum count rate\nwith respect to the Finland radar as the Earth rotates around\nits axis. All of these factors will impinge upon the measured\nvelocities by the radars. Data from 1997 were chosen for\nthe comparison as both radars were operating continuously\nat 10 MHz at that time. Beams 10\u201315 from the Finland radar\n(Fig. 10a) were compared with the first six beams from Ice-\nland (Fig. 10b) as they both look towards the north-northeast\ndirection. There was a slight mismatch of around 10 degrees\nbetween the two swaths, but the use of six adjacent beams\ninstead of just three provided increased data coverage.\nThe three-hour lag in the Iceland data set is apparent in\nthe semi-diurnal tidal structure. The agreement was closest\nin the summer months before noon (local time). This is a\nreflection of the enhanced data quality at these times. The\nvelocity values were most noisy during the winter afternoon\nwhere the data rates can be quite low. Applying the appropri-\nate correction factor to compensate both radars for the back-\nward lobe velocity reduction would bring the results into bet-\nter agreement with the Esrange radar observations.\n7 Discussion and conclusions\nThe SuperDARN operating frequencies of 8\u201320 MHz (pri-\nmarily 10\u201312 MHz) present a challenge for making quantita-\ntive observations of meteor winds in the upper mesosphere\nand lower thermosphere. However, the geographical and\ntemporal extent of the network provides a unique opportunity\nto generate an important and new data base of winds in this\nregion. Twelve MHz is a good choice of frequency for me-\nteor observations in that the count rate is acceptably high and\nthe contamination relatively low. Ten MHz produces more\nmeteors at the expense of a broadening of the beam pattern,\nenhanced rear lobe distortion of the measurements and its\nsusceptibility to ionospheric influences. The eastern flank\nof the Northern Hemisphere chain, namely the CUTLASS\nradars have used 10 MHz for its common programme mode\nfor much of the past five years and will continue to do so for\nthe foreseeable future.\nSeveral earlier studies confined the definition of meteors\nto those signals that have spectral widths less than 20 ms\u22121.\nOur work has suggested that there is continuity at least up\nto 40 ms\u22121 and possibly beyond. While the possibility of\ncontamination increases with spectral width, even the lower\nN. F. Arnold et al.: Comparison of D-region Doppler drift winds 2081\nthreshold was not totally effective at screening out unwanted\nsignals, so the introduction of algorithms to identify contam-\ninants within this range allowed for more data of better qual-\nity to be considered. Large patches with strong echo pow-\ners, typically associated with sporadic-E layers will have a\ntendency to bias the wind observations to greater altitudes.\nHowever, the spatial and temporal coherence of these echoes\nmakes it relatively straightforward to remove them from the\ndata set. To date, we have employed relatively crude hourly\nmean statistics to identify unsatisfactory intervals where the\npossibility of contamination is high. There is room for more\nsophisticated algorithms that divide the field-of-view into\nsmaller temporal and spatial segments.\nAnother possible source of targets in the upper meso-\nsphere\/lower thermosphere region arises from the ability of\nthe SuperDARN radars to detect Polar Mesospheric Summer\nEchoes (PMSEs). Peak activity levels occur at altitudes be-\ntween 80\u201390 km, between the months of June and August\nin the Northern Hemisphere (see, for example, Kelley et al.,\n2002). In contrast to the sporadic-E echoes, PMSE layers\nare around 10 km lower than would be typical of the me-\nteor layer. While the interferometer used by the SuperDARN\nradars is relatively crude, it can often be used to help to dis-\ntinguish between the two populations, especially when the\nradar is operating at a range resolution of 15 km. Also, the\ndiurnal variation of meteor rates is well established, so un-\nusually dense populations of echoes with relatively uniform\nspectral widths and velocities in the summer months dur-\ning non-meteor shower intervals would indicate that a PMSE\ncloud may be present. Additional filters could check for such\nechoes and isolate them. Indeed, PMSEs make excellent\ntargets for monitoring line-of-sight velocities when they are\npresent, and this will be the subject of a future study.\nAt 10 MHz, and to a lesser extent 12, there was a signifi-\ncant contribution to the wind climatologies from meteors de-\ntected behind the radar. These could reduce the measured\nvelocity by up to 50%, so a correction factor that depends\non operating frequency will need to be applied when using\nthe SuperDARN radars. The introduction of dual transmis-\nsion pulse capability on CUTLASS should provide a means\nto use this effect to our advantage. Two signals with distinc-\ntive frequencies will be sent out with a temporal separation\nof just 400\u00b5s, to illuminate the same volume of space. For\nall but the briefest meteor echoes, this should ensure that co-\nincident observations in the two channels occur. The ratio of\nback scattered power returns from the two pulses reflecting\nfrom the same target will be markedly different, depending\non whether the signal came from the front or the back of the\nradar. Explicit observations of rear lobe echoes, in combina-\ntion with the VHF meteor data, would extend the latitudinal\ncoverage of wind measurements by the two instruments to\n1500 km.\nThe CUTLASS HF radars observed neutral winds that\nwere comparable to a dedicated VHF meteor radar system\ndeployed approximately 700 km away. Being relatively more\npowerful and operating at a significantly lower frequency,\nthe HF radars picked up considerably more echoes per unit\narea, thereby compensating for their relatively narrow fields-\nof-view. For the purposes of this paper, we have developed\nlong-term climatological data sets where most of the remain-\ning contamination was uncorrelated to the neutral wind sig-\nnal and so may be discounted as noise. Differences between\nthe Iceland and Finland winds confirmed that operating fre-\nquency and local ionospheric conditions needed to be consid-\nered carefully in the creation of D-region winds around the\nSuperDARN network. Once this has been done, the data will\nbe of great value in the study of the dynamics of the upper\nmesosphere and the lower thermosphere.\nAcknowledgements.
