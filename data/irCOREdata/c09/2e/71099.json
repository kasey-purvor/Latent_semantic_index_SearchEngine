In this paper we study the effect of artificial HF\nheating on cosmic radio noise absorption in the D-region\nionosphere. The effect has earlier been studied theoreti-\ncally in idealised cases and without experimental verifica-\ntion. Here we present a 3-dimensional modelling of the ef-\nfect, taking into account the directivity patterns of the vertical\nbeam of the EISCAT Heater at Troms\u00f8, Norway, and the in-\ntersecting beam of the IRIS imaging riometer at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi,\nFinland. The heater-induced enhancement of cosmic radio\nnoise absorption at the IRIS frequency (38.2 MHz) is esti-\nmated to be between 0.02 dB and 0.05 dB in the most repre-\nsentative model cases.\nHowever, a statistical study of IRIS data from a selected\nset of heating experiments carried out during the years 1994\u2013\n2004 shows that the median effect is between 0.002 dB and\n0.004 dB, i.e. an order of magnitude less than theoretically\npredicted. This indicates that the actual HF heating effect\nat D-region altitudes is substantially overestimated by the\npresent theory.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Active experiments; Instruments\nand techniques) \u2013 Electromagnetics (Wave propagation)\n1 Introduction\nRadio wave absorption is known to take place in the iono-\nspheric D-region through collisions of electrons, which are\naccelerated by the electric field of the radio wave, with neu-\ntral atoms and molecules. Radio wave absorption provides\nexperimental access to the D-region, the probing of which\nis otherwise difficult. A widely used method is monitor-\ning of cosmic background radio noise with riometers (rel-\native ionospheric opacity meters). Imaging riometers, such\nCorrespondence to: A. Kero\n(antti.kero@sgo.fi)\nas the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) sys-\ntem (Detrick and Rosenberg, 1990; Browne et al., 1995) at\nKilpisj\u00e4rvi, Finland (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E), use narrow-beam\nformation by phased-array antennas in order to monitor spa-\ntial structures of the ionosphere (see Fig. 1).\nThe absorption of radio waves also makes it possible to\nheat the ionospheric electron gas using high-power HF trans-\nmitters. The heating facility of the European Incoherent\nScatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) at Troms\u00f8, Norway\n(69.6\u25e6 N, 19.2\u25e6 E) has been designed for this purpose (see\nRietveld et al., 1992). According to earlier modelling work\n(Belova et al., 1995; Kero et al., 2000) the facility, which has\nan effective radiated power (ERP) of up to 1.2 GW, is capa-\nble of increasing the electron temperature by a factor of ten\nat a maximum. However, the modelled maximal effect has\nnot been verified by any observations. The lack of EISCAT\nradar verification is due to the electron densities generally\nbeing below the detection limit at the altitude of the maximal\nheating effect.\nIn contrast to radar measurements, passive monitoring of\nany HF radio waves penetrating through the heated volume\ncan be used as a diagnostic technique. This is possible be-\ncause the increased electron temperature raises the electron-\nneutral collision frequency, and therefore decreases the trans-\nparency of the plasma. This additional absorption can be sup-\nposed to take place and disappear practically immediately,\nin timescales of milliseconds, when the heater is turned on\nand off (Rietveld et al., 1986). To a lesser extent, the trans-\nparency may also change through electron temperature de-\npendent chemistry (formation of negative ions) during the\nheating periods (Enell et al., 2005), but the magnitude of this\neffect is marginal and its time constant is several seconds to\nminutes. Thus the effect on cosmic radio noise intensity seen\nin the riometer beam overlapping the heated volume is ex-\npected to be a step function of a certain magnitude added to\nthe natural variations of the transparency. Pashin et al. (2003)\nand Enell et al. (2005) have estimated the magnitude of the\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n408 A.

However, as Fig. 1 shows, beam number 9 of\nthe Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS riometer crosses the vertical main lobe\nof the EISCAT heater at D-region altitudes and should not\nbe affected by any F-region heating effects. This study is\ndedicated to finding the D-region heating effect and its mag-\nnitude, both by modelling and by statistical analysis of IRIS\nbeam 9 data as contrasted to the other IRIS beams not over-\nlapping the heated volume.\n2 Modelling\n2.1 Radio wave absorption\nRadio wave propagation in a collisional magnetised plasma\nis described by the refractive index n, whose imaginary part\n=(n)<0 determines the attenuation of the wave. The inten-\nsity I of the wave along a path r is\nI (r) = I0 exp\n(\n2\u03c9\nc\n\u222b r\n0\n=(n(r)) dr\n)\n(1)\nHere \u03c9 is the radio-wave angular frequency, I0 the intensity\nwithout absorption and c the speed of light. The generalised\nAppleton dispersion theory given by Sen and Wyller (1960)\nis used to calculate the refractive indices no and nx for the or-\ndinary (o) and extraordinary (x) modes of polarisation. The\nrefractive indices are functions of the electron density Ne,\nthe external magnetic field B and the electron-neutral colli-\nsion frequency \u03bden. A sum of electron temperature dependent\nrates of momentum transfer to N2, O2 and O, listed by Banks\nand Kockarts (1973), is used for \u03bden whereas the pure mag-\nnetic dipole approximation is used for B.\nIn the model Eq. (1) is calculated numerically as\nI (r)=I0D(r), where the decay D due to absorption is ap-\nproximated by a sum over steps 1r as\nD(r) = exp\n(\n2\u03c9\nc\n\u2211\nr\n=(nr)1r\n)\n(2)\nIn this paper both the absorption of the heater radio wave and\nof the cosmic radio noise are calculated using Eq. (2).\n2.2 Heating model\nThe intensity of a radio wave, emitted by the heater antenna\nfield, along a ray path r is determined by Eq. (1), where the\nunabsorbed intensity is given by transmitter power P and an-\ntenna gain G in the ray direction:\nI0 = PG4pir2 (3)\nHeater radiation patterns (in dB scale) for antenna fields 1\nand 2 of the Eiscat heater are illustrated in Fig. 2, upper right\npanel.\nAnn.

Lower right panel: Profiles of electron density (Friedrich et al., 2004), atmospheric\nneutral components and temperature (MSISE-90) for the modelling cases.\nConsider now the energy transfer from the radio wave to\nthe electron gas due to absorption. According to Eq. (1) the\nabsorbed power per volume is\nQ = 2\u03c9\nc\n=(n(r))I (r). (4)\nElectron energy loss occurs through collisions with neutrals.\nIn the model, the electron energy loss rate L is the sum of\nthe rates of rotational and vibrational excitation of O2 and\nN2 given by Pavlov (1998a,b) and the rates due to collisions\nwith atomic oxygen according to Stubbe and Varnum (1972).\nAll loss rates are functions of prevailing electron temperature\nTe. Note that also Q depends on the electron temperature,\nbecause the imaginary part of the refractive index, =(n), de-\npends on the electron-neutral collision frequency \u03bden, which\nis a function of Te. Hence, the electron temperature is deter-\nmined by\nkQ(Te) = L(Te) (5)\nunder thermal equilibrium. We introduce a scaling factor k,\nwhich is typically set to unity assuming that the absorbed\nenergy is entirely transferred to electron thermal energy and\nthat all loss processes are known. The use of this constant\nscaling factor is a zeroth-order parameterisation of possible\nunknown electron energy gain and loss processes, or errors in\ninput parameters such as overestimated transmitter power. In\nreality the scaling factor can be a function of electron temper-\nature. The sensitivity of the model for values k<1 is studied\nin Sect. 2.5.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/407\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 407\u2013415, 2007\n410 A. Kero et al.: Heating effect on riometer absorption\nThe electron temperature along the ray path in 1 km strat-\nified layers is modelled using the routine described by Kero\net al. (2000) which follows Belova et al. (1995).\nFirst, the intensity of the wave is calculated on a ray path\nat each altitude h using Eqs. (2) and (3). The equilibrium\nelectron temperature Te(h) that fulfils Eq. (5) is solved for\nwithin 1 K tolerance. Thereafter the refractive index of the\nlayer must be recalculated for the new electron-neutral colli-\nsion frequency determined by the increased electron temper-\nature Te(h). The intensity penetrating into next layer, and its\nelectron temperature, can be calculated in the same fashion.\nThis procedure is continued until a desired altitude.\nIn our application, the electron temperature is modelled for\neach 1-km step along an IRIS riometer ray through the iono-\nsphere (see Fig. 2, lower left panel, crossing of blue and red\nlines). The electron temperatures thus obtained are used in\nthe following calculations of cosmic radio noise absorption.\n2.3 Cosmic radio noise absorption model\nThe cosmic radio noise absorption Ar(tsid) detected by a ri-\nometer is a measure of the noise power P(tsid) compared\nwith a certain reference value called the quiet-day power\nPQ(tsid), so that Ar=10 log\n(\nP(tsid)\/PQ(tsid)\n)\n. The sidereal\ntime tsid is used because the power is a function of the num-\nber of distant cosmic radio sources seen by the riometer\nbeam.\nWe assume that the extraionospheric cosmic radio noise is\nan isotropic energy flux of randomly polarised waves, so that\nstatistically the radio noise intensity (power per unit solid an-\ngle) is independent of direction and both modes of propaga-\ntion have equal intensity (I0o=I0x).\nLet the intensity given by Eq. (1) represent a small solid\nangle element around the ray. The total power detected by\nthe riometer is then an integral of the intensity over all solid\nangles weighted by the directivity function wD of the instru-\nment:\nP =\n\u222b\n\nwD()(Io + Ix) d. (6)\nIn the model, the integral is solved numerically as a mean\nof calculated intensities in the barycentres of N triangular\ntesselations, weighted both by the solid angle 1i of each\ntriangle, and by the instrument directivity function wDi in\nthe barycentre direction\nP =\nN\u2211\ni=1\n(Io + Ix)1iwDi\nN\u2211\ni=1\n1iwDi\n(7)\nThe absorption difference between heated (H) and back-\nground (BG) ionosphere is modelled based on Eqs. (2)\nand (7) as follows:\n1Ar = AH \u2212 ABG = 10 log (PH\/PBG) (8)\n= 10 log\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\nN\u2211\ni=1\n1iwDi (DoHi +DxHi)\nN\u2211\ni=1\n1iwDi (DoBGi +DxBGi)\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nDMCi = exp\n(\u2211\nr\n=(nMCir)1r\n)\nwhere DMCi is calculated for each tesselation direction i and\nall combinations of mode M (x or o) and case C (H or BG).\nThe corresponding refractive indices for the heated case,\nnoHir and nxHir , are calculated using the electron tempera-\ntures modelled as in Sect. 2.2, whereas for the background\nrefractive indices noBGir and nxBGir the electron temperature\nis set equal to the neutral temperature. The refractive indices\nare calculated at the frequency of the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS riome-\nter (38.2 MHz). Note that 1Ar , as a relative quantity, does\nnot depend on the isotropic source intensity I0. The directiv-\nity function wD of Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS beam 9 and the equally\nspaced triangular tesselation barycentres (N=401) are illus-\ntrated in the upper left panel of Fig. 2.\n2.4 Model results\nThe absorption differences 1Ar were modelled with the fol-\nlowing selected sets of input parameters, shown in Fig. 2,\nlower right panel:\n\u2013 3 electron density profiles (low, medium and high) ob-\ntained from a statistical model developed by Friedrich\net al.

In the 2-\ndimensional intersections shown, the effects of antenna field\nselection and electron density are clearly visible. Field 1\nproduces an intense narrow effect including also faint sig-\nnatures of the first sidelobes, while field 2 gives a broad but\nfaint effect. The higher the electron density is, the stronger is\nthe effect, although that is partially compensated by a slight\ndownshift from the IRIS beam center. Variations between\npolarisation modes and seasons are not that clear.\nThe integrated cosmic radio wave absorption differences\n1Ar , calculated according to Eq. (8), are shown in Fig. 4.\nThe absorption difference modelled for IRIS beam 9 is, in all\nthe cases, larger than 0.01 dB. The most significant param-\neter is the antenna gain, which depends on the selection of\nheater antenna field: in average, field 2 produces only half the\ncorresponding effect of field 1 in dB scale. An increase of the\neffect as a function of electron density is also clearly visible\nin all cases. Some minor-scale differences are found between\nseasons: summer atmosphere yields higher effects, except in\nthe high electron density case with antenna field 2. The more\nefficiently absorbed x-mode seems to produce slightly higher\neffects in most of the cases, except for the combination of\nhigh electron density and field 1. There the x-mode effect is\nshifted too far downwards compared with the less absorbed\no-mode, which penetrates closer to the center of the IRIS\nbeam.\n2.5 Model sensitivity tests\nIn order to study the accuracy of the model, tests for model\nsensitivity to changes of some parameters are shown in\nFig. 5.\nThe upper left panel illustrates how the absorption dif-\nference estimates of all 24 modelled cases converge as a\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/407\/2007\/ Ann.

The de-\nviation between N=401 and N=250 is 0.1% in average and\n0.3% at a maximum. Hence, the used N=401 describes the\ngeometry of the experminent well and, in fact, results ob-\ntained withN=250 can as well be considered correct, if there\nis a need for saving calculation time.\nIn the modellings shown in Fig. 4, only the lowest recom-\nmended frequency was used for each antenna field (Field 1:\n5.423 MHz, Field 2: 4.04 MHz). In the current model, di-\nrectivity patterns are also available for one higher frequency\nof each antenna field. Modelling using these higher frequen-\ncies (Field 1: 7.953 MHz, Field 2: 5.423 MHz) was done\nfor both o- and x-mode under winter-time medium-Ne con-\nditions. The results are compared with the corresponding\nlower-frequency cases in Fig. 5, upper right panel. Although\nthe higher frequencies produce slightly smaller effects, the\ndifference is less than 0.002 dB\/MHz for both antenna fields.\nHence, the variation due to different heater frequencies can\nbe expected to be neglible, especially when taking into ac-\ncount the fact that the lowest frequencies are more often used\nin the EISCAT heating experiments (see Table 1), in contrast\nto the seldom used highest frequencies.\nBeam 9 of the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS riometer is pointing in the\ndirection from SE towards NW (\u221245\u25e6 from the riometer),\nwhich is close to perfectly matching the vertical EISCAT\nHeater beam (the azimuth angle difference is only 1.5 de-\ngrees). Figure 3 shows that also the zenith angle of IRIS\nbeam 9 is close to optimal, providing the maximum heat-\ning effect well inside the beam according to modelling. The\nlower left panel of Fig. 5 illustrates the importance of the\naccuracy of the IRIS beam directions by showing the mod-\nelled absorption difference as a function of IRIS azimuth and\nFig. 5.

The relation between absorption difference and k is al-\nmost linear, which makes it easy to scale the modelled re-\nsults when comparing with the effects found by statistical\ndata analysis in Sect. 3.\n3 Statistical data analysis\nTo study whether the modelled effect is seen in real experi-\nments, we have analysed IRIS absorption data from all beams\nshown in Fig. 1 for selected EISCAT heating experiments\nduring 1994\u20132004.\nAnn.

Dates of selected IRIS data 1994\u20132004.\n3.1 Data selection\nData from vertical-beam heating experiments with simple\non\/off modulation and on\/off times from 1 s (the IRIS time\nresolution) to 60 s were chosen. Imposing the latter restric-\ntion we avoid large natural background fluctuations during\nthe modulations. These data, covering in total 18417 on\/off\nmodulations, represent all seasons, as shown in Fig. 6. The\nheater parameters used in these experiments are summarised\nin Table 1.\n3.2 Absorption differences\nAs a basis for the statistical treatment of the absorption\ndata we define an absorption difference for each on\/off-\nmodulation period as the difference between the mean ab-\nsorption during the heater-on period and the mean absorp-\ntion during the following heater-off period. If the absorp-\ntion of cosmic radio noise is enhanced due to the heating,\nas theoretically predicted, the distribution of the absorption\ndifferences should have a positive offset for the overlapping\nbeam (beam 9) as compared with the other beams. In Fig. 7\nthe left plot shows histograms of the background absorption\nand the right plot shows histograms of absorption differences\nfor all selected experiments. The background absorption, de-\nfined as the mean absorption during each on\/off-modulation,\nis classified into \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d as a measure\nof electron density. The limits are chosen so that one third of\nthe data points fall into each category and this classification\nTable 1.

Note that the\n\u201clow\u201d background absorption category contains many points\nof negative absorption. These do not necessarily represent\nlow electron densities but are more likely the result of radio\nsources not properly included in the quiet-day curve.\nIn the right plot of Fig. 7 we see that the natural variation\nof the absorption differences is larger than the majority of the\nmodelled differences shown in Fig. 4.\n3.3 Bootstrap median error analysis\nTo find the possibly very small statistical offset of the ab-\nsorption differences we use median estimates rather than av-\nerages because of their robustness in the presence of outliers.\nTo quantify the accuracy of the median estimates without\nmaking any assumptions of the statistical distribution of the\ndata, a Monte-Carlo method called bootstrap analysis (Efron,\n1979) is used. In this approach it is assumed that the stud-\nied samples represent the statistical properties of the system\nwell, so that any random subset of the original samples has\nthe same statistical properties. It is then possible to obtain\nestimates for many subsets containing the same number of\npoints as the original data, and hence to study the variance of\nthe estimates in cases of different weightings of the original\ndata.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/407\/2007\/ Ann.

Right\npanel: Histograms of calculated absorption differences for IRIS\nbeam 9 and the reference beams (all beams except no. 9) for these\nexperiments.\nWe performed the bootstrap median estimates for 10 000\nrandom subsets of the original data and of the data sorted ac-\ncording to heater antenna field and background absorption.\nFigure 8 shows these estimates for the 12 combinations of\nheater experiments (all, field 1, field 2) and backgrounds (all,\nlow, medium, high). Error bars show the 95% confidence in-\ntervals, i.e., 9500 out of the 10 000 median estimates for each\nbeam and criterion of data selection are within the shown\nlimits. The results show a consistent offset in beam 9, except\nfor the combinations of field 1 and low background absorp-\ntion and possibly also field 2 with medium and high back-\nground absorption, for which the data points are too few to\nyield significant estimates.\nSince the overlapping beam number 9 is the only one\nwhere the offset is always positive, we are confident that\nthe difference is a result of the EISCAT heating experiments,\neven though the magnitude of the effect is very small. In\nfact, the effect is smaller than the digital quantisation of the\nIRIS A\/D converter. However, this is not a limit for the res-\nolution of the estimates shown in Fig. 8, because these are\nbased on medians of many data points with a reasonable nat-\nural variance. It can be concluded that the median absorption\nenhancement is 0.002\u20130.005 dB.\n4 Discussion\nThe input parameter sets used in our 24 modelling cases\nare chosen to represent the variety of typical conditions and\nheater parameters. The most typical experiment condition is\na combination of winter time, medium electron density, an-\ntenna field 2 and heater x-mode, which gives an absorption\ndifference of 0.02 dB. An effect of this magnitude is still\nFig. 8. Medians of the observed absorption differences, with 95%\nbootstrap error bars, for all IRIS beams.

Moreover, in most of the modelled cases, especially\nin those experiments using antenna field 1, the effect should\nbe higher, up to 0.07 dB at a maximum. The sensitivity stud-\nies in Sect. 2.5 show that the modelled results are robust to\nvariation of heater frequency and also to all conceivable in-\naccuracies of IRIS beam directions. We have also verified\nthat the spatial resolution (N=401) used in the modellings\ndescribes the geometry of the experiment sufficiently well.\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 407\u2013415, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/407\/2007\/\nA. Kero et al.: Heating effect on riometer absorption 415\nThe statistical analysis shows, however, that the effect in\nreality is very small. Large data sets containing data from\nthe entire period 1994\u20132004 were necessary to discriminate\nthe unique offset compared with the 48 reference beams at\na 95% significance level. The median effect, representing\nthe expectation value of the absorption difference, was found\nto be 0.002\u20130.005 dB. The effect was not unambiguously\ndetectable in any single heating experiment in the data set.\nIn spite of the discrepancy, a factor of 5 to 10, it can be\nseen (comparing Figs. 4 and 8) that the model reproduces\ntwo significant features found in the statistical data analy-\nsis. Firstly, antenna field 1 produces approximately twice\nthe absorption differences of field 2. Secondly, the absorp-\ntion difference increases as a function of electron density (or\nbackground absorption).\nTo reproduce the measurements quantitatively a model\nscaling factor k<0.2 is required. The reason for this dis-\ncrepancy remains an open question. A large overestimate of\nthe heater antenna gains would be a sufficient explanation,\nbut the error is unlikely to be more than 1 dB and hence can-\nnot account for this scaling factor (which would correspond\nto an overestimate of 7 dB). The remaining possibilities are\nthat either\n1. the energy production, as given by the imaginary part of\nthe refractive index of Sen and Wyller (1960), is over-\nestimated because the theory does not hold true for the\ncollisional, almost neutral gas of the D-region, or\n2. the loss rate of electron energy is in reality 5 to 10 times\nhigher than in the model.\n5 Conclusions\nFor the first time the D-region heating-induced enhancement\nof cosmic noise absorption has been quantified by determin-\ning the statistical enhancement of Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS absorption\nduring EISCAT heating experiments. The expectation value\nof the effect during typical conditions is close to 0.003 dB.\nA rigorous 3-D modelling yields absorption differences be-\ntween 0.02 dB and 0.07 dB.\nBased on sensitivity studies we conclude that the discrep-\nancy is not likely caused by any reasonable inaccuracies of\nthe model input parameters. The reason remains an open\nquestion. Possibly the generalised magnetoionic theory of\nSen and Wyller (1960) overestimates the production term\n(wave absorption), or there are additional electron energy\nloss processes not accounted for in our model.\nAcknowledgements.
