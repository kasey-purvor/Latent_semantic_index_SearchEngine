Some dynamical and chaotic properties are studied for a classical particle\nbouncing between two rigid walls, of which one is fixed and the other moves in time,\nin the presence of an external field. The system is a hybrid, behaving not as a purely\nFermi-Ulam model, nor as a bouncer, but as a combination of the two.

For intense external fields,\nwe establish the range of control parameters values within which invariant spanning\ncurves are observed below the chaotic sea in the low energy domain. We characterise\nthis chaotic low energy region in terms of Lyapunov exponents. We also show that the\nvelocity of the particle, and hence also its kinetic energy, grow according to a power\nlaw when the wall moves randomly, yielding clear evidence of Fermi acceleration.\n1. Introduction\nA special class of one-dimensional time-dependent systems exhaustively investigated in\nrecent years are those related to the Fermi model. The latter system was originally\nproposed by Enrico Fermi [1] in order to study cosmic rays. It provides a mechanism\nthrough which charged particles can be accelerated by collisions with time-dependent\nmagnetic fields. The model was later studied in different versions and using different\napproaches [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 10]. One of them consists in considering the dynamics of a\nclassical particle bouncing between two rigid walls, one of which is fixed and the other one\nmoves in time, known as the Fermi-Ulam model. The main result for periodic oscillation\nis that the phase space presents KAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea. Unlimited\nenergy growth (the condition for observing Fermi acceleration) is not, however, observed\nbecause the phase space exhibits a set of invariant spanning curves [11]. An alternative\nversion of this model, proposed by Pustylnikov [12], is often referred to as a bouncer.\nIt consists of a classical particle falling in a constant gravitational field, on a moving\nplatform. The most important property of this system is that, in contradistinction to\nthe Fermi-Ulam model, depending on both the initial conditions and control parameters\nthere is no bound to the energy gained by the bouncing particle. This special difference\nbetween the models was clarified by Lichtenberg et al [13]. The quantum versions\ncorresponding to both the bouncer and Fermi-Ulam models have also been studied\n[14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\nPublished in J. Phys. A Math. Gen. 38, 823-829 (2005).\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 2\nThe special interest attached to studying these one-dimensional classical systems is\nthat they are completely integrable for zero external time-dependent forcing, but non-\nintegrable when the external forcing is switched on, and they allow direct comparisons\nof theoretical predictions with experimental results [19, 20, 21]. Such systems present\na very rich phase space structure. Depending on the values chosen for the control\nparameters, and on the initial conditions, both periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic\nbehaviour can be observed. However, this kind of behaviour seems to be generic for no\ndegenerated Hamiltonian systems and could be observed for time dependent potentials\n[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], mesoscopic systems [28, 29], waveguides [30] and also for billiards\nwith static boundaries [31, 32, 33]. Moreover, considering time-dependent boundaries\nfor such billiards, the scenario can be quite different. In this sense, regular dynamics for\na fixed boundary implies a bound to the energy gained by the bouncing particle, but the\nchaotic dynamics of a billiard with a fixed boundary is a sufficient condition for Fermi\nacceleration in the system when a boundary perturbation is introduced. A discussion\nof this interesting question, together with specific examples, can be found in Ref. [34].\nIn this paper we study a hybrid model that behaves, not as purely Fermi-Ulam\nmodel, nor as a bouncer, but as a combination of both. It consists of a time-dependent\nsystem where a classical particle is confined between two rigid walls in the presence\nof a gravitational field. One wall is fixed and the other one moves in time. We will\nconsider in different sections two different kind of movement, namely: (i) periodic and\n(ii) random. For the periodic perturbation, the system is described by a two-dimensional\nnonlinear area-preserving map with two relevant control parameters. We will show that\nfixed points and periodic orbits go over smoothly into orbits of the Fermi-Ulam model as\nthe external field goes to zero. We also show that the phase space presents a hierarchy\nof behaviours. It is possible to observe KAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea that\nis limited by one invariant spanning curve. Considering an intense external field, we\nshow that this system presents a set of invariant spanning curves located below the\nchaotic sea, indicating that the system then behaves mainly as a bouncer. If the wall\nmoves randomly, the system exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi acceleration, which can\nbe interpreted as evidence of the particle having unlimited energy gain.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Sec. II we discuss in full detail all the steps\nused to derive the map describing the dynamics of this system. We construct both\ncomplete and simplified versions [35] of the problem. We also discuss briefly some\nresults and properties of both the Fermi-Ulam and bouncer models that are useful for\ncomparisons with results of our model. In Sec. III, we establish the connections between\nour hybrid model and the Fermi-Ulam model, and we discuss the features that emerge\nfor the case of intense external fields. Sec. IV presents our numerical results for positive\nLyapunov exponents, for both the complete and simplified models. In Sec. V we discuss\nthe results obtained for the stochastic version of model, and Sec. VI summarises our\nresults and presents our conclusions.\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 3\n2. The model with periodic oscillations\nThe model consists basically of a classical particle of mass m, subject to a constant\ngravitational field g, bouncing between two rigid walls. One of them is fixed at y = l\nand the other one moves periodically in time according to the equation yw(t) = \u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9t).\nThe parameter \u0002\u2032 represents the amplitude of oscillation and \u03c9 is the angular frequency.\nFig. 1 illustrates the model. We will study this problem in two different versions: (i)\ncomplete; and (ii) simplified. In the complete version, the model includes explicitly the\nmovement of the oscillating wall. The instant of time at which each collision occurs\nis obtained numerically by solution of a transcendental equation. However, we can\nintroduce a very useful and more simple version to this problem that allows easier\nanalytical treatment: the simplified version. For the simplified version [35], we suppose\nthat both walls are fixed but that, when the particle collides with the wall located at\ny = 0, it exchanges momentum as if the wall was moving. This simplification forces\nus to introduce a strategy to avoid the successive collisions that occur only in the low\nenergy domain for the complete model. At the same time, this version brings the\nadvantage of allowing us to speed up our numerical simulations. The results obtained\nfor a weak gravitational field and high energy are qualitatively almost the same as for\nthe complete model, but differ for intense external fields or for low energy. However, in\nthe simplified version, it is useful and much easier to identify generic behaviours that\ncan immediately be sought in the corresponding complete version. We will observe that\nthe quantitative results, in particular the positive Lyapunov exponent, are different\nin magnitude for the two versions of the model. Such differences are due to a few\ncrucial intrinsic differences between the systems. We will describe the dynamics of\nboth systems using a two dimensional map T that gives us the corresponding pair of\nvelocity vn and time tn values immediately after the collision with the oscillating wall,\ni.e. (vn+1, tn+1) = T (vn, tn).\n2.1. The complete model\nLet us now begin to construct the map. Suppose that, after suffering a collision with\nthe moving wall at a time t = tn at the position yw = \u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn), the velocity of the\nparticle is v = vn. Depending on both the velocity vn and the time tn, the two different\nkinds of behaviour that may occur are:\n(a) The particle again collides with the moving wall before exiting the collision region.\nIt is characterised as a successive collision.\n(b) The particle exits the collision region without suffering any further collision.\nThe collision area is defined as the region in real space within which it is possible for\nthe particle to suffer a collision with the moving wall, and it is given by y \u2208 [\u2212\u0002\u2032, \u0002\u2032], as\ncan be seen in Fig. 1.\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 4\nl\n2\u03b5\u2019\ng\nv\nFigure 1. Sketch of the model with constant external field.\nConsidering first case (a), the instant of time at which the particle collides with\nthe moving wall is obtained from the condition yp(tc) = yw(tc), where yp(tc) gives the\nposition of the particle at time tc. This condition leads to the transcendental equation\ng(tc) = \u0002\n\u2032 cos[\u03c9(tn + tc)]\u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)\u2212 vntc + 1\n2\ngt2c . (1)\nHere, tc is the smallest root of g(tc) for tc \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9]. The time tc = 0 is excluded\nbecause it is a fixed point of g(tc). After the collision, the new time is given by\ntn+1 = tn + tc. The new velocity is obtained by requiring conservation of energy and\nmomentum in the frame of reference of the moving wall (in which it is instantaneously\nat rest) and is given by vn+1 = \u2212vn + gtc \u2212 2\u03c9\u0002\u2032 sin(\u03c9tn+1). The velocity of the moving\nwall, vw(t) is obtained using\nd\ndt\nyw(t) = \u2212\u03c9\u0002\u2032 sin(\u03c9t). After that, we can write the map\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 5\nfor successive collisions, Ts as\nTs :\n{\nvn+1 = \u2212vn + gtc \u2212 2\u03c9\u0002\u2032 sin(\u03c9tn+1)\ntn+1 = tn + tc\n, (2)\nwhere tc is obtained numerically from g(tc).\nIf g(tc) does not have a solution in the interval tc \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9], we can conclude that\nthe particle leaves the collision area without suffering a successive collision. Case (b)\nthen applies, and there are two new different kinds of behaviour that may occur:\n(b1) The particle does not reach and collide with the fixed wall located at y = l, but\nreturns in the downward direction due to the gravitational field alone.\n(b2) The particle collides with the wall at y = l. It suffers a reversal of its momentum\nand returns downwards.\nThe basic condition for the particle suffering a collision with the fixed wall located at\ny = l is vn >\n\u221a\n2g[l\u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)]. Otherwise, the particle returns without colliding with\nthe fixed wall.\nLet us first study case (b1), i.e. vn \u2264\n\u221a\n2g[l \u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)]. The time during which the\nparticle rises and decelerates before its velocity falls transiently to zero is tu = vn\/g. In\nthis time, the particle reach a maximum height, ymax = \u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn) + 12\nv2n\ng\n. The particle\nis then accelerated downwards by the external gravitational field until it reaches the\nentrance to the collision area y = \u0002\u2032. The time that the particle spends on this part\nof its trajectory is td = (\n\u221a\nv2n + 2g[\u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)\u2212 \u0002\u2032])\/g . At the entrance of the collision\narea, y = \u0002\u2032, the velocity of the particle is\nve = \u2212\n\u221a\nv2n + 2g[\u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)\u2212 \u0002\u2032]. (3)\nAfter the particle enters this region, the instant of time at which the collision occurs is\nobtained from the condition yp(tc) = yw(tc), giving rise to the transcendental equation:\nf(tc) = \u0002\n\u2032 cos[\u03c9(tn + tu + td + tc)]\u2212 \u0002\u2032 \u2212 vetc + 1\n2\ngt2c . (4)\nHere, tc is the smallest root of the function f(tc) in the interval tc \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9]. We can\nnow write the map Tns as\nTns :\n{\nvn+1 = \u2212ve + gtc \u2212 2\u03c9\u0002\u2032 sin(\u03c9tn+1)\ntn+1 = tn + tu + td + tc\n. (5)\nWe now consider situation (b2), i.e. vn >\n\u221a\n2g[l \u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)]. The time that the\nparticle spends on going up is tu = (vn \u2212\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2g[l\u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)])\/g. When the\nparticle arrives at and collides with the fixed wall at y = l, its velocity is given by\nv =\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2g[l \u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)]. The time it spends on going down before it reaches\nthe entrance to the collision area is given by td = (\n\u221a\nv2n + 2g[\u0002\n\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)\u2212 \u0002\u2032])\/g \u2212\n(\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2g[l\u2212 \u0002\u2032 cos(\u03c9tn)])\/g. The velocity of the particle immediately before entering\nthe collision area ve is still described by Eq. (3). The instant of time at which it suffers a\ncollision with the moving wall is obtained by solution of f(tc). Again, tc is the smallest\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 6\nvalue of tc \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0\/\u03c9]. After the collision, the new velocity and the new time are again\ngiven by applying the map Tns.\nIt is easy to see that, in the form (2) and (5) in which the map T was constructed,\nthere is an excessive number of control parameters, 4 in total, namely \u0002\u2032, \u03c9, l and g.\nWe now define dimensionless and much more appropriate variables in order to reduce\nthe effective and relevant control parameters to just 2. The first change is to measure\ntime in terms of the period of oscillation of the moving wall, \u03c6n = \u03c9tn. We can also\ndefine a new velocity as Vn = vn\/(\u03c9l) so that the new amplitude of oscillation is given\nby \u0002 = \u0002\u2032\/l. Using the period of oscillation \u03c4 , given by \u03c4 = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9, we are able to define\na new variable Nc = \u03c4c\/\u03c4 . Here, \u03c4\n2\nc = 2l\/g gives us the squared time that the particle\nspends in travelling the distance l under the influence of the gravitational field g starting\nwith initial velocity v = 0. In this way, Nc gives us the number of oscillations that the\nmoving wall completes in a time \u03c4c.\nUsing these new variables, the map is written as\nT :\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9 Vn+1 = V\n\u2217\nn +\n\u03c6c\n2\u03c02N2c\n\u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1)\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + \u0394Tn mod2\u03c0\n(6)\nwhere \u0394Tn and V\n\u2217\nn are given by different expressions that depend on the following\nconditions:\n(i) Successive collision. \u0394Tn = \u03c6c and V\n\u2217\nn = \u2212Vn. Here \u03c6c is obtained as the smallest\nroot of G(\u03c6c) in the interval \u03c6c \u2208 (0, 2\u03c0] and G(\u03c6c) is given by\nG(\u03c6c) = \u0002 cos(\u03c6n + \u03c6c)\u2212 \u0002 cos(\u03c6n) + V \u2217n \u03c6c +\n\u03c62c\n4\u03c02N2c\n. (7)\n(ii) Indirect collision without reflection, Vn \u2264\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u0004 cos(\u03c6n)\n\u03c0Nc\n. This condition establishes\nan indirect collision without reflection at y = 1. Then\n\u0394Tn = \u03c6u + \u03c6d + \u03c6c , (8)\nV \u2217n =\n\u221a\nV 2n +\n\u0002\n\u03c02N2c\n[cos(\u03c6n)\u2212 1]. (9)\nHere \u03c6u = 2\u03c0\n2N2c Vn, \u03c6d = 2\u03c0Nc\n\u221a\n\u0002 cos(\u03c6n)\u2212 \u0002 + \u03c02N2c V 2n and \u03c6c is obtained\nnumerically as the smallest root of F (\u03c6c) in the interval \u03c6c \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], where F (\u03c6c)\nis given by\nF (\u03c6c) = \u0002 cos(\u03c6n + \u03c6u + \u03c6d + \u03c6c)\u2212 \u0002 + V \u2217n \u03c6c +\n\u03c62c\n4\u03c02N2c\n. (10)\n(iii) Indirect collision with reflection, Vn >\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u0004 cos(\u03c6n)\n\u03c0Nc\n. This condition establishes\nan indirect collision with reflection at y = 1. The terms \u0394Tn and V\n\u2217\nn\nare given by Eq. (8) and (9), as in the previous case. The only the\ndifference is that here \u03c6u = 2\u03c0Nc\n[\n\u03c0NcVn \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03c02N2c V\n2\nn \u2212 1 + \u0002 cos(\u03c6n)\n]\n, \u03c6d =\n2\u03c0Nc\n[\u221a\n\u0002 cos(\u03c6n)\u2212 \u0002 + \u03c02N2c V 2n \u2212\n\u221a\n\u0002 cos(\u03c6n)\u2212 1 + \u03c02N2c V 2n\n]\n, and \u03c6c is obtained\nnumerically as the smallest root of Eq. (10) under the same conditions as in the\nprevious case.\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\u03c6\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nV\nFigure 2. Phase space for the complete model. The control parameters used here\nwere \u0002 = 10\u22123 and Nc = 28.\nAfter some tedious but necessary algebra, we can show that this map preserves the\nfollowing measure on the phase space: d\u03bc = [V + \u0002 sin(\u03c6)]dV d\u03c6. It is interesting that\nthis measure d\u03bc is the same as that obtained [10] for the Fermi-Ulam model itself.\nThe same measure was also found for the breathing circle [36]. Note however that a\ndiametrical orbit in the breathing circle necessarily recovers the results of the Fermi-\nUlam model.\nA typical phase space for the complete model is shown in Fig. 2. The control\nparameters used were \u0002 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 and Nc = 28. For this combination of control\nparameters, a hierarchy of behaviours is immediately evident. In the low energy regime,\nthe system shows a set of KAM islands that are surrounded by a chaotic sea. This\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 8\nchaotic sea, characterised by positive Lyapunov exponents, is limited by one invariant\nspanning curve. Above the chaotic sea, it is possible to observe KAM islands as well as\nsmall chaotic regions confined by two different invariant spanning curves. For yet higher\nvalues of energy, we can see basically invariant spanning curves. A characteristic feature\nof this model, quite unlike the Fermi-Ulam model, is that in the low energy regime for\nappropriate combinations of control parameters (especially for intense external fields),\nit is possible to observe a set of invariant spanning curves as well as stable fixed points.\nWe will show that this kind of behaviour is property of the bouncer model. A more\ndetailed discussion of the necessary conditions for such observations will be given in Sec.\n3.\nWe now describe briefly the tool used to characterise the chaotic low energy region:\nthe Lyapunov exponent. It is well known as a practical tool that can quantify the average\nexpansion or contraction rate for a small volume of initial conditions. One can say that\na negative Lyapunov exponent implies a convergence of nearby initial conditions. An\norbit that has this property is said to be regular (periodic or quasi-periodic). When\nthe Lyapunov exponent is positive, however, it characterises an exponential divergence\nof initial conditions and it is related to chaotic motion. An orbit that is characterised\nby a positive Lyapunov exponent is referred to as chaotic. We use the algorithm of\ntriangularisation [37] to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents. They are defined as\n\u03bbj = lim\nN\u2192\u221e\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nn=1\nln |\u039bnj | , j = 1, 2 , (11)\nwhere \u039bnj are the corresponding eigenvalues of DT\nN =\n\u220fN\nn=1 Jn. The matrix J is\nthe Jacobian matrix for the map T . As the map is area-preserving, the Lyapunov\nexponents obey the relationship that \u03bb1 = \u2212\u03bb2. Fig. 3(a) shows the convergence for\n5 different initial conditions related to the chaotic sea, for the complete model. Each\ninitial condition was iterated 5 \u00d7 108 times in order to produce a good convergence of\nthe asymptotically positive Lyapunov exponent. The ensemble average of five different\ninitial conditions gives us that \u03bb\u00af = 0.794 \u00b1 0.005. The error represents the standard\ndeviation of the five samples.\n2.2. The simplified model\nLet us now discuss the simplified model [35]. It consists basically in supposing that\nboth walls are fixed but that, after each collision, the wall located at y = 0 transfers\nmomentum to the particle as if it was moving. It can immediately be seen that the\ntranscendental equations G(\u03c6c) and F (\u03c6c) no longer need to be solved. Although this\nsimplification brings the huge advantage of allowing very fast simulations, it also gives\nrise to a problem that we need to avoid. In the complete model, depending on the\ncombination of both velocity and phase, it is possible for the particle, after suffering a\ncollision with the moving wall, to suffer a second successive collision before exiting the\ncollision area, as well as possibly having a negative velocity following the first such a\ncollision. In the simplified model, non-positive velocities are forbidden because they are\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 9\n0 1.5e+08 3e+08 4.5e+08\nn\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n\u03bb\n0 1.5e+08 3e+08 4.5e+08\nn\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\n\u03bb\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.

In order to avoid such problems,\nif after the collision the particle has a negative velocity, we inject it back with the same\nmodulus of velocity. Such a procedure is effected perfectly by use of a module function.\nNote that the velocity of the particle is reversed by the module function only if, after the\ncollision, the particle remains travelling in the negative direction. The module function\nhas no effect on the motion of the particle if it moves in the positive direction after\nthe collision. We stress that this approximation is valid only for small values of \u0002. In\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 10\naccordance with this discussion, the map for the simplified model is written as{\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1)|\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + \u0394Tn mod2\u03c0\n, (12)\nwhere\n\u0394Tn = 4\u03c0\n2N2c\n[\nVn \u2212\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212\n1\n\u03c02N2c\n]\nif Vn >\n1\n\u03c0Nc\n(13)\n\u0394Tn = 4\u03c0\n2N2c Vn if Vn \u2264\n1\n\u03c0Nc\n(14)\nThis map is area-preserving because detJ = \u00b11. The phase space for the simplified\nversion shows basically the same properties present in the complete model, i.e. it has\na structure of KAM islands, a chaotic sea and invariant spanning curves. However,\ndue to the module function, the velocity of the particle has the following constraint\n[Vn \u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1)] > 0. It is shown in Fig. 3(b) the time evolution of the positive\nLyapunov exponent for 5 different initial conditions related to the chaotic sea. The\nasymptotic value is 1.509 \u00b1 0.006. Here, the error of 0.006 represents the standard\ndeviation of the five samples.\n2.3. Fermi-Ulam model\nBefore considering the connection between the models, let us briefly discuss some\nproperties of the Fermi-Ulam model. Considering g = 0 on Fig. 1, and using the\noptimal variables, the map describing the dynamics of the simplified Fermi-Ulam model\nis given by {\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1)|\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n +\n2\nVn\nmod2\u03c0\n. (15)\nThe phase space for this system exhibits KAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea that\nis limited by one invariant spanning curve in the low energy domain. For high energy, it\nshows basically a set of invariant spanning curves. As discussed in [10], the position of\nthe first invariant spanning curve can be rescaled for different control parameters and\nconnected to the Standard Map (SM) to appear for the same effective control parameter\n(KFU \u2248 0.971 . . .) at which the SM undergoes a change of locally to globally stochastic\nbehaviour [39]. Such scaling provides the explanation for the quasi-invariance of the\npositive Lyapunov exponent in the chaotic sea for this model [10]. (See also Ref. [7] for\nrecent results of the simplified Fermi-Ulam model). Table I shows the classification of\nperiodic orbits for the Fermi-Ulam model.\n2.4. Bouncer model\nIn this section we will discuss a special transition observed in the bouncer model. For\nsimplicity and to make it easier to compare some results of this model with those for\nour hybrid model, we will use the same variables to describe both models. To obtain\nthe bouncer model, we just need to move out the fixed wall located at y = l in Fig.\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 11\nPeriod V \u03c6 \u0002 Type\n1 1\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 2, 3 . . . 0 all Hyperbolic\n1 1\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 2, 3 . . . \u03c0 < 1\nj2\u03c02\nElliptic\n1 1\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 2, 3 . . . \u03c0 = 1\nj2\u03c02\nParabolic\n1 1\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 2, 3 . . . \u03c0 > 1\nj2\u03c02\nHyperbolic\n2 2\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 3, 5 . . . 0 and \u03c0 < 2\nj2\u03c02\nElliptic\n2 2\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 3, 5 . . . 0 and \u03c0 = 2\nj2\u03c02\nParabolic\n2 2\nj\u03c0\n, j = 1, 3, 5 . . . 0 and \u03c0 > 2\nj2\u03c02\nHyperbolic\nTable 1. Classification of periodic orbits of periods 1 and 2 for the simplified Fermi-\nUlam model.\n1. In this way, the map that describes the dynamics of the simplified bouncer model is\ngiven by {\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1)|\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + 4\u03c0\n2N2c Vn mod2\u03c0\n. (16)\nThe term 4\u03c02N2c Vn represents the time that the particle spends travelling between\nimpacts. The special advantage of this system is that it allow the possibility\nof predicting analytically where the transition occurs between locally and globally\nstochastic behaviour [39]. To put the map (16) in the same form as the SM, we must\nfirstly to define two variables. The first one is In = 4\u03c0\n2N2c Vn and the second one is\n\u03b8n = \u03c6n+1 + \u03c0. In terms of these new variables, the map (16) may now be rewritten in\nthe same form as the SM [3]{\nIn+1 = In + KB sin(\u03b8n)\n\u03b8n+1 = \u03b8n + In+1\n. (17)\nThe effective control parameter KB = 8\u03c0\n2\u0002N2c . However it is expected that, if KB \u2265\n0.971 . . ., the SM will exhibit globally stochastic behaviour [39]. To characterise such a\ntransition in the bouncer model in terms of both Nc and \u0002, we just need to evaluate the\neffective control parameter KB. Using the above condition, 8\u03c0\n2\u0002N2c = KB \u2265 0.971 . . .,\nwhence\nNc \u2265 1\n2\u03c0\n\u221a\n0.971 . . .\n2\u0002\n.

The limits of Nc\nWe will discuss in this section how the connection of the present model to the Fermi-\nUlam one can be established. It is well known that the parameter Nc = \u03c4c\/\u03c4 describes\nthe intensity of the gravitational field. It effectively specifies the number of oscillations\nthat the moving wall (in the complete model) executes during the time interval \u03c4c. This\ntells us the length of time during which the particle travels a distance l (in the original\nmodel), under a gravitational field g after starting with an initial velocity V = 0. We can\nconclude that a huge (small) value of Nc implies motion in a weak (intense) gravitational\nfield. In this way, it is clear: (i) that Nc \u2192 \u221e implies g \u2192 0; and (ii) that Nc \u2192 0\nimplies g \u2192\u221e.\n3.1. The limit Nc \u2192\u221e\nLet us first discuss case (i). In this situation, it is supposed that the results of the\nFermi-Ulam model should be recovered. For simplicity of calculation, we will use the\nsimplified model although, with a bit more work, just the same procedure can be applied\nfor the complete version too. The application of Nc \u2192\u221e excludes the Eq. (14) from the\nrelation of \u0394Tn on the simplified model because we are considering only non-negative\nvelocities. We can now expand Eq. (13), obtaining\n\u0394Tn = lim\nNc\u2192\u221e\n4\u03c02N2c \u00d7\n\u23a1\n\u23a3Vn \u2212\n\u239b\n\u239d\u221aV 2n \u2212 1\n2\u03c02\n\u221a\nV 2n N\n2\nc\n\u239e\n\u23a0+ . . .\n\u23a4\n\u23a6 (19)\nConsidering that all the higher order terms disappear when the limit is applied, we can\ngreatly simplify the last equation to\n\u0394Tn =\n2\nVn\n. (20)\nThis is the equation that gives the length of time which a particle spends between\ncollisions in the Fermi-Ulam model (see Sec. 2.3) and demonstrates that, in the present\ncase, the Fermi-Ulam map is indeed recovered.\nIt is also interesting to characterise how the fixed points for our present model go\nover into the fixed points of the Fermi-Ulam model. It is well known that periodic orbits\nare obtained when the following conditions are satisfied: Vn+m = Vn and \u03c6n+m = \u03c6n.\nHere, m gives the periodicity of the orbit, so that one has period-one orbits with m = 1,\nperiod-2 orbits with m = 2, and so on. To characterise such an evolution, let us consider\nfirst the case Vn > 1\/(\u03c0Nc). The equations to be solved for the fixed points are\n\u03c6n+1 = \u03c6n + 4\u03c0\n2N2c\n[\nVn \u2212\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212\n1\n\u03c02N2c\n]\n= \u03c6n,\nVn+1 = Vn \u2212 2\u0002 sin(\u03c6n+1) = Vn.\nTheir solution gives us that\nVn =\nj\n4\u03c0N2c\n+\n1\nj\u03c0\nwith j = 1, 2, 3 . . . \u2264 2Nc (21)\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 13\nand \u03c6n = 0 or \u03c6n = \u03c0.

The classification of fixed points (Vn, \u03c6n) = (\nj\n4\u03c0N2c\n+ 1\nj\u03c0\n, \u03c0) is summarised in\nTable II.

(23)\nSolving these conditions, we find that Vn =\nj\n2\u03c0N2c\nwith j = 1, 2, 3 . . . \u2264 2Nc and \u03c6n = 0 or\n\u03c6n = \u03c0. The fixed points (Vn, \u03c6n) = (\nj\n2\u03c0N2c\n, \u03c0) are hyperbolic for all values of \u0002 whereas\n(Vn, \u03c6n) = (\nj\n2\u03c0N2c\n, 0) are elliptic for \u0002 < 1\n2\u03c02N2c\n, parabolic for \u0002 = 1\n2\u03c02N2c\nand hyperbolic for\n\u0002 > 1\n2\u03c02N2c\n. The same analysis for the period-two orbit yields\n\u03c6n+2 = \u03c6n + 8\u03c0\n2N2c [Vn \u2212 \u0002 sin(\u03c6n + 4\u03c02N2c Vn)] = \u03c6n,\nVn+2 = Vn \u2212 2\u0002[sin(\u03c6n + 4\u03c02N2c Vn) + sin(\u03c6n+2)] = Vn.\nThe solutions under such conditions give us that Vn+1 = Vn =\nj\n4\u03c0N2c\nwith j =\n1, 3, 5 . . . \u2264 4Nc, \u03c6n = 0 and \u03c6n+1 = \u03c0. Such a period-two orbit is elliptic for \u0002 < 14\u03c02N2c ,\nparabolic for \u0002 = 1\n4\u03c02N2c\nand hyperbolic for \u0002 > 1\n4\u03c02N2c\n. All periodic orbits obtained for\nthe condition Vn \u2264 1\u03c0Nc are the same that are present in the bouncer model. To be more\nprecise, for the bouncer model there is not constraint to the values of j. In that model,\nj can run from 1 to infinity. Such fixed points and periodic orbits do not exist on the\nFermi-Ulam model; they are exclusively present in the bouncer model. Applying the\nlimit Nc \u2192\u221e, we see that both the period-one and period-two orbits disappear.\n3.2.

Such curves give us clear evidence that\nthe model is behaving as a bouncer. The basic condition of existence for such curves\nis, at least numerically, the same as that for the fixed point (Vn, \u03c6n) = (\nj\n2\u03c0N2c\n, 0) to be\nelliptic, in the simplified model, i.e. \u0002 < 1\n2\u03c02N2c\n. Such curves appear to exist only in the\ncomplete model.\nIt was shown in Sec. 2.4 that the bouncer model undergoes a transition from locally\nto globally stochastic behaviour [39]. It means in our model that for Nc \u2265 12\u03c0\n\u221a\n0.971...\n2\u0004\nit\nis possible to observe a chaotic sea. However, we observe that the invariant spanning\ncurves located below the chaotic sea exist when the condition Nc <\n1\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n2\u0004\n. In this sense,\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 16\nwe can shall define a range for Nc as function of \u0002 in which these invariant spanning\ncurves in the very low energy can coalesce with the chaotic sea. Such a range is given\nby Nc \u2208 [ 12\u03c0\n\u221a\n0.971...\n2\u0004\n, 1\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n2\u0004\n). Considering the parameter \u0002 = 10\u22123, the range of Nc is\nNc \u2208 [3.507 . . . , 7.117 . . .).\nTo illustrate the existence of these invariant spanning curves and the location of\nfixed points in the low energy domain, we construct the phase space for the following\ncontrol parameters values \u0002 = 1\u00d710\u22123 and Nc = 4, as shown in Fig. 4. Note however that\nNc = 4 is in fact contained in the range obtained above. For easier comparison, we focus\nonly on the chaotic low energy region for the simplified version, and the corresponding\nregion for the complete version. An expansion of Fig. 4 in the very low energy domain\nis shown in Fig. 5. We can see that the complete and simplified versions behave\nquite differently in this energy limit. It is also clear that the complete model allows\nnegative velocities, whereas they are of course not allowed in the simplified version. It\nis important to stress that the invariant spanning curves in the very low energy domain\nare not observed in the simplified version due to the properties of this version of the\nmodel in that energy limit. However they were foreseen to exist, and were then observed\nin the complete model.\nIt is interesting to note that our hybrid model has its own characteristics. In\nextreme ranges of control parameters, it recovers the results of the Fermi-Ulam model\nat high energy while exhibiting the results of the bouncer model in the low energy\nregion for intense gravitational fields. Moreover, our results show that, within a certain\nrange of control parameters, properties that are individually characteristic either of the\nFermi-Ulam or of the bouncer model can come together and coexist in our hybrid model.\n4. Numerical results\nWe discuss in this section our numerical results for the region of positive Lyapunov\nexponent in both the complete and simplified version of our model. We concentrate on\nthe low energy chaotic region analysing the behaviour of the positive Lyapunov exponent\n\u03bb as function of Nc, as plotted in Fig. 6 with a fixed control parameter \u0002 = 10\n\u22123 for\nboth (a) the complete and (b) the simplified models. Each point in this figure was\nobtained from the convergence of an ensemble average of 5 different initial conditions. In\norder to guarantee good convergence of the asymptotically positive Lyapunov exponent\nvalue, each initial condition was iterated 5 \u00d7 108 times. The error bars indicates the\nstandard deviation of the five samples. We see in Fig. 6 that the Lyapunov exponent\nvaries significantly as a function of Nc, and does so differently for the two versions.\nFor the complete version, where we have a more realistic description of the problem,\nthe positive Lyapunov exponent grows for small values of Nc reaching a maximum and\nthen decreasing asymptotically to a constant value. The maximum value of positive\nLyapunov exponent is assumed to correspond to where the system experiences the\nstrongest competition in whether to behave as a bouncer or as a Fermi-Ulam model. For\nthe simplified version, it grows for small values of Nc and reaches a regime of saturation\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 17\n10 100 1000 10000\nN\nc\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n\u03bb\n10 100 1000 10000\nN\nc\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n1.6\n\u03bb\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.

Both the saturation and the convergence to a constant level can\nbe explained as being due the fact of this model, in both its simplified and complete\nversions, must recover the Fermi-Ulam model results for very large Nc, as discussed in\nSec. 3. In order to compare these asymptotic values with those from the Fermi-Ulam\nmodel, we evaluate the convergence of the positive Lyapunov exponent for this latter\nmodel in both complete and simplified versions. The Fermi-Ulam model is found to\nhave \u03bbc = 0.722\u00b1 0.008 for its complete version, and \u03bbs = 1.63\u00b1 0.01 for its simplified\none (see also Ref. [10] for Lyapunov exponents in the Fermi-Ulam model). Both results\nare in good agreement with those shown in Fig. 6.\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 18\nNow let us discuss why the positive Lyapunov exponent differs between the complete\nand simplified versions. Although the structure of fixed points, KAM islands and\ninvariant spanning curves are very similar for both versions within their high energy\ndomains, they are quite different in the low energy regimes. To illustrate one of\nthese differences, we note that the complete version exhibits invariant spanning curves,\nwhereas they are absent in the simplified version for \u0002 < 1\n2\u03c02N2c\n. The obvious differences\nbetween the models are that: (i) the simplified model does not allow immediately\nsequential collisions; (ii) after the impact it does not allow a negative velocity; and\n(iii) it incorporates a forbidden region into the phase space.\n5. The stochastic model\nIn this section we discuss some dynamical properties of the stochastic model. Our\nresults for the complete and simplified deterministic models discussed above show that\nthe phenomenon of Fermi acceleration does not occur for those versions. Its absence is\nattributable to the existence of invariant spanning curves in the phase space [11]. Such\ncurves, in particular the first one above the chaotic sea, form boundaries limiting the\nsize of the chaotic sea. In this sense, a particle evolving in the chaotic sea can never rise\nabove the first invariant spanning curve. As we will see, the hierarchy of behaviours like\nKAM islands, chaotic sea, and invariant spanning curves does not arise in the stochastic\nmodel. The most interesting result for this version is that the velocity, and consequently\nthe kinetic energy, grow as function of both iteration number n and time t. The model\nis created by a subtle modification of the simplified version where (see above) a particle\ncolliding with the wall located at y = 0 exchanges momentum as if the wall was moving.\nIn the stochastic model, such exchanges occur randomly. The map for this version is\ngiven by {\nVn+1 = |Vn \u2212 2\u0002z|\ntn+1 = tn + \u0394Tn\n, (24)\nwhere\n\u0394Tn =\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9 4\u03c0\n2N2c\n(\nVn \u2212\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 1\u03c02N2c\n)\nif Vn >\n1\n\u03c0Nc\n4\u03c02N2c Vn if Vn \u2264 1\u03c0Nc\n. (25)\nHere, z is a random number uniformly distributed in the interval z \u2208 [\u22121, 1].\nIteration of the stochastic map for one initial condition is shown in Fig. 7(a). The\ncomplex structure and hierarchy of the phase space present in the deterministic models\nare not observed here. Both KAM islands and invariant spanning curves are destroyed\nand, as a consequence of this, any one initial condition may lead to unlimited energy\ngrowth. To demonstrate this result we can compute the following observables\nV\u00af =\n1\nM\nM\u2211\ni=1\n[\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nn=1\nVn,i\n]\n, t\u00af =\n1\nM\nM\u2211\ni=1\n[\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nn=1\ntn,i\n]\n.

The result for Nc \u2192 \u221e indicates\nthat \u03b4t \u2192 1, as was found for the simplified stochastic Fermi-Ulam model [38]. It can be\nobtained by extrapolation, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(b) after changing the horizontal\ncoordinate to Nc \u2192 1\/Nc and doing a linear fit. It is interesting to emphasise that the\nauthors of [34] conjectured that Fermi acceleration should be observed for a billiard\nwith a time-dependent boundary if the corresponding version for a fixed boundary\npresents chaotic components. However, we can conclude that for the system studied\nin the present paper (see also [25] and [26, 27] for comparable results in other systems)\nA hybrid Fermi-Ulam-bouncer model 21\nwhich exhibits chaotic behaviour under a time-dependent (periodic) perturbation, Fermi\nacceleration is observed only after the introduction of random (stochastic) motion to\nthe time dependent wall.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\nWe have studied a hybrid model behaving, not exclusively as a Fermi-Ulam model, nor\nas a bouncer, but as a combination between them. We analysed two different kind of\nmovement: (i) periodic and (ii) random. For the periodic case, we derive two different\nversions of the system: complete; and simplified. We have shown that these systems\npresent a rich and complex structure of phase space showing KAM islands, a chaotic sea\nand invariant spanning curves. We also show that these models, in both their complete\nand simplified forms, recover the results of the well known Fermi-Ulam model in the\nlimit of zero external field. We show that the periodic orbits go over smoothly into the\norbits of the Fermi-Ulam model. Such a transition characterises smooth evolution from\none area-preserving map to another that preserves the same measure in the phase space.\nConsidering the case of an intense external field and low energy regime, we observe that\nour model exhibits a similar structure of fixed points to that obtained in the bouncer\nmodel. In particular, the complete model presents the set of invariant spanning curves\nlocated below the chaotic sea that was foreseen by analysis of the simplified version\nof the model. We have also characterised the chaotic sea using Lyapunov exponents.\nConsidering the case of random perturbation, we show that the structure of KAM islands\nand invariant spanning curves is completely destroyed and that, as a consequence, any\ninitial condition in the phase space leads to Fermi acceleration. Such acceleration is\ncharacterised by unlimited velocity and correspondingly energy growth.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by a grant from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u00b4\u0131fico CNPq, from Brazil.
