It proposes that Katz employs the motif of vanishing tricks to explore the relationship between the trauma of migration and non-normative sexualities. Further, drawing on Terry Castle\u2019s observation that, historically, lesbianism has appeared in culture only \u2018as an absence, as chimera or amor impossibilia\u2019 and Gayatri Gopinath\u2019s observation that non-normative genders and same-sex desire are rendered inconceivable by conventional models of diaspora, it argues that the conjuring and escapology practised by the novel\u2019s two female protagonists represent a radical desire to achieve the impossible. Katz\u2019s cross-dressed magician and her assistant, who escapes the \u2018white slave trade\u2019, achieve this when they shatter the illusion of heteronormativity and take the mutually exclusive binary categories of gender to vanishing point. The novel also reconceives home and history from a post-Zionist, queer perspective. Elaborating on Jonathan Freedman\u2019s assertion that klezmer music represents the queer, the diasporic, and the Jewish, the essay thus proposes that The Escape Artist celebrates the subversive possibilities of a specifically \u2018klezbian\u2019 subjectivity and desire.Peer-reviewedPost-prin","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/9780","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/9780\/1\/%5b01%5d%20Parker%20TP%20Essay%20March%202011.pdf","pdfHashValue":"1af391ddeb681caf33e50f68547e187dc1da35b5","publisher":"Taylor & Francis (Routledge)","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/9780<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2013-02-26T02:45:07Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_849<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9548<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_9371<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nMagic, diaspora, and klezbian desire in Judith Katz's The Escape Artist<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nParker, Emma<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\nMagic<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\ndiaspora<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nJewish<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nlesbian<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nklezmer<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\ntransvestism<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nhistory<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\nqueer fiction<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Textual Practice, 2011, 25 (4), pp. 689-710.

Wonder workers and \u2018miracle mongers\u2019, as Houdini called them,2 have \nproved no less popular on screen, as Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Prestige (2006), Neil \nBurger\u2019s The Illusionist (2006), and Gillian Armstrong\u2019s Death Defying Acts (2007) \nattest.  However, The Escape Artist (1997), the second novel by Lambda Literary \nAward-nominated Jewish American author Judith Katz,3 stands apart from recent \nrepresentations of practitioners of the arts of illusionism, flimflam and flummery by \nfeaturing a female magician. Set in Poland and Buenos Aires at the beginning of the \ntwentieth century, The Escape Artist focuses on two central characters: Sofia, who is \nduped into leaving her home in Warsaw for the New World, where she is coerced into \nprostitution, and the woman who becomes her lover - Hankus (formerly Hannah) \nLubarsky, a cross-dressing conjurer and escapologist who flees the pogroms of Poland \nto begin a new life in South America where she strives to become \u2018the most respected \nmagic-maker since Houdini\u2019.4 By focusing on the migration of Jews from Eastern \nEurope to Argentina rather than New York,5  the novel explores a lesser known and \nunderrepresented aspect of the Jewish diaspora and, this essay argues, employs magic \nas a metaphor for both the traumatic effects and transformative potential of queer \ndiaspora. Also, it is contended here that Katz stresses the specificity of the queer \n 2 \ndiasporic Jewish female or \u2018klezbian\u2019 - a term inspired by Jonathan Freedman\u2019s \nassertion that klezmer is a diasporic and queer form of Jewish music and the lesbian \nklezmer band Isle of Klezbos.6  Further, by accenting \u2018klezbian\u2019 lives, The Escape \nArtist simultaneously challenges a hegemonic model of Jewish diaspora that endorses \ndominant gender and sexual ideologies and resists the focus on men in North America \nthat has characterized discourses of queer diaspora.7\n \n  \nIn An Archive of Feeling: Trauma, Sexuality and Lesbian Public Cultures \n(2003), Ann Cvetkovich examines traumatic histories of migration from a queer \nperspective, exploring how non-normative sexualities \u2018emerge from the trauma of \nmigration\u2019 and highlighting \u2018queer possibilities for working through trauma\u2019.8 For \nHankus, the principle escape artist in Katz\u2019s novel, magic not only functions as a \nmetaphor for migrancy \u2013 as Michael Mangan points out, the first magicians were \nitinerants (gypsies, travelers)9 \u2013 but also expresses the trauma that necessitates \nmigration. Having witnessed Cossack soldiers defile her female relatives, massacre \nher family, and wipe out the entire village, Hankus pulls on her father\u2019s clothes, hacks \noff her long hair, and flees to Cracow where she is adopted by two men. Max and \nMotke disguise Hankus as a boy and introduce her to conjuring as a distraction from \nfear and pain: \u2018Max or Motke found you in a corner of the cellar, sometimes shaking, \nsometimes crying\u2019 (p. 89). Magic, the art of misdirection, provides a diversion from \nterror for Sofia too when, in the novel\u2019s opening scene, watching a magician\u2019s show \nhelps her to forget threatening Russian soldiers: \u2018those stupid soldiers with their quick \nfists and bad tempers disappeared from my mind as quickly as they\u2019d frozen my \nheart\u2019 (p. 12). Published just at the point when a new psychoanalytic discourse of \ntrauma was developing out of Holocaust Studies, Katz\u2019s treatment of magic reflects \n 3 \nthe central tenets of trauma theory. Shoshana Felman defines trauma as an \noverwhelming experience that cannot be fully apprehended or processed. Traumatic \noccurrences are those that \u2018have not settled into understanding or remembrance, acts \nthat cannot be constructed as knowledge nor assimilated into full cognition, events in \nexcess of our frames of reference\u2019.10 Reflecting this, Sofia, who relates her lover\u2019s \ntale, explains that \u2018something so terrible has happened to you that you find yourself \nwalking in the pouring  rain on a dirt road to Cracow and you\u2019ve no idea why\u2019 (p. 85). \nIn this context, Hankus\u2019s preoccupation with vanishing tricks bespeaks a desire to \nrepress - that is, to vanish - traumatic memories. As Sofia states, \u2018you saw what those \nsoldiers did to your mother and sister. You tried not to remember\u2019 (p. 89). However, \nunable to forget what she refuses to remember, Hankus unconsciously restages the \nscene of trauma as events she seeks to deny or avoid demand recognition. As Cathy \nCaruth explains, like forgetting, \u2018the unwitting enactment of an event that one cannot \nsimply leave behind\u2019 is a symptom of trauma.11\n \n Hankus learns to vanish various \nobjects \u2013 coins, scarves, spoons, a gramophone \u2013 but principally herself, and  by \ndisappearing she unconsciously recreates the sense of invisibility she felt when \nsoldiers slaughtered everyone around her: \u2018You stood frozen. You stood invisible\u2019 (p. \n177). Likewise, through escapology, Hankus constantly replays the moment she \nescaped death.  Thus, for Hankus, magic is a symptom of acute psychic distress and \narticulates the unspeakable trauma of the past.  \nHowever, if magic is a symptom of trauma, it simultaneously offers a means \nof survival. After the massacre, Hankus adopts invisibility as a form of protection: \n\u2018When soldiers stroll by you hold your breath. You become invisible, that\u2019s how you \nlive\u2019 (p. 86). Similarly, when Russian officers visit Max and Motke\u2019s caf\u00e9, she \n 4 \ndisappears \u2018into thin air\u2019 (p. 92). Vanishing tricks thus function as a strategy for self-\npreservation. Moreover, as magic depends on the reappearance of the disappeared \nobject, Hankus\u2019s passion for magic ultimately signals a refusal to be rubbed out. \nDescribed as a \u2018ghost\u2019 (p. 86), she represents the return of the repressed, repeatedly \nerasing herself only to demonstrate that she returns and endures. Similarly, through \nthe art of escapology, in which, as Daphne Brooks notes, the performer makes a \nspectacle of defeating death,12 Hankus expresses a determination to survive. Further, \ngiven Mangan\u2019s assertion that \u2018conjuring is all about power\u2019,13\n \n Hankus\u2019s desire to \nperform impossible feats can be read as an unconscious response to the sense of \npowerlessness she experiences as a helpless witness to the genocidal pogrom that \nannihilates her family and community. In short, magic endows Hankus with a sense of \nagency. \nAlthough repression enables survival, trauma theorists propose that memory is \nthe route to recovery, asserting that the pain of the past must be relived in order to be \nrelieved. As Dori Laub states, \u2018One has to know one\u2019s buried truth in order to be able \nto live one\u2019s life\u2019.14 Endorsing Cvetkovich\u2019s assertion of the queer potential for \nworking through trauma, Hankus\u2019s recollection of traumatic events is enabled by her \nfirst sexual encounter with another woman. As Sofia states, \u2018when we kissed, you \nremembered everything\u2019 (p. 173). Trauma theorists also posit that testimony plays a \nvital role in the therapeutic process - to \u2018know\u2019 one\u2019s story, it is necessary to \u2018tell\u2019 \none\u2019s story15 \u2013 and insist that testimony requires a witness. While The Escape Artist \nbears out Dori Laub\u2019s proposition that \u2018only when the survivor knows he is being \nheard, will he stop to hear - and listen to \u2013 himself\u2019\u2019,16 it not only recognises female \nsubjects elided in Laub\u2019s androcentric formulation but also acknowledges patriarchy \n 5 \nas a source of trauma for women. Sofia\u2019s parents remember clearly what Hankus is \ntoo traumatized to recall: \u2018all the rapes of all their cousins and cousin\u2019s daughters, and \ncousins\u2019 daughters\u2019 cousins\u2019 (p. 29). Hankus recounts her story to Sofia, who acts as \nwitness by relating this tale back to her (and to the reader): \u2018Come close, my darling. \nI\u2019ll tell it for you now as you told me, although it breaks both our hearts\u2019 (p. 174). \nIndeed, as the opening words of the novel indicate, Sofia\u2019s entire narrative is \naddressed to her lover - \u2018Sweet Hankus!\u2019 (p. 11) - and throughout she adopts the \ndirect address and intimate conversational tone that, as Victoria Aarons notes, \ncharacterizes Jewish American fiction concerned with bearing witness.17\n \n In this way, \nKatz not only stresses the queer possibilities for working through trauma identified by \nCvetkovich but also transforms same-sex desire between women, historically \nperceived as sickness, into a source of salvation. \nThe relationship between trauma and magic is likewise explored in Chabon\u2019s \ncritically acclaimed bestseller The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay, which \nechoes The Escape Artist in several ways. Having escaped Nazi-occupied Prague with \nthe help of an illusionist, Josef Kavalier - magician and escapologist - creates the \ncomic-book superhero The Escapist with his American cousin Sammy Clay. \nPowerless to help the family he has left behind in Prague and other victims of the \nHolocaust, Joe creates an imaginary figure that performs heroic feats of rescue. The \nEscapist, whom Sammy describes as \u2018Houdini, but mixed with Robin Hood and a \nlittle bit of Albert Schweitzer\u2019, roams the globe \u2018performing amazing feats and \ncoming to the aid of those who languish in tyranny\u2019s chains\u2019.18 Fighting Hitler and \nliberating the oppressed with his Golden Key, The Escapist not only compensates Joe \nfor his own sense of impotence but also offers a means of survival in the face of \n 6 \ntrauma. For Joe, \u2018a ridiculous, make-believe war against enemies he could not defeat, \nby a means that could never succeed\u2019 offers \u2018the only possible salvation of his sanity\u2019 \n(p. 285). Despite the striking parallels between The Escape Artist and Kavalier and \nClay, Chabon won the Pulitzer Prize whereas Katz\u2019s novel, which appeared three \nyears earlier, has received scant critical attention to date. \n \nOne reason for Chabon\u2019s success is that his novel focuses on male experience. \nDemonstrating Gayatri Gopinath\u2019s central point in Impossible Desires: Queer \nDiasporas and South Asian Public Cultures (2005), that \u2018all too often diasporas are \nnarrativized through the bonds of relationality between men\u2019,19\n \n in Kavalier and Clay \nthe relationship between Joe and Sammy is central and, while the novel acknowledges \nqueer desire, such desire circulates only between men. Sammy falls in love with \nTracy Bacon, the actor who plays The Escapist when his cartoon strip is turned into a \nradio play and eventually fulfils his \u2018Houdiniesque\u2019 dreams of transformation when \nhe abandons the masquerade of devoted family man (which he adopts when he \nmarries the pregnant girlfriend Joe unwittingly abandons) to purse a new and sexually \nliberated life in Los Angeles (p. 3).  \nWhile the surname of Sammy\u2019s lover communicates the taboo nature of his \ndesire (bacon is a food forbidden by Judaic law), the Jewish prohibition of \nhomosexuality paradoxically rests on its recognition. In contrast, as Rebecca Alpert \nnotes, because lesbianism is not acknowledged in the Torah, it is \u2018invisible\u2019 in the \nJewish community.20 In The Apparitional Lesbian (1993), Terry Castle adopts \nspectrality as a metaphor for lesbian (in)visibility: while the lesbian has been \n\u2018ghosted\u2019, she constantly returns \u2018to haunt\u2019 culture.21 Yet Castle discusses lesbian \n 7 \n(in)visibility in terms of conjuring as well as spectrality. Despite derealization, the \nlesbian re-appears, as if by magic: \u2018within the very imagery of negativity lies the \npossibility of recovery \u2013 a way of conjuring up, or bringing back into view, that \nwhich has been denied\u2019.22 She concludes, \u2018the spectral vernacular, it turns out, \ncontains its own powerful and perverse magic\u2019.23\n \n In The Escape Artist magic is \nassociated with homosexuality through Max and Motke, the two men who teach \nHankus how to conjure, and who describe themselves as \u2018brothers\u2019 but are actually \n\u2018sweethearts\u2019 (p. 88). Further, magic is linked specifically with lesbian desire at the \nstart of the novel when, after imagining her first love, Tamar, in the role of magician, \nand herself the assistant cut in two, Sofia feels \u2018a little thrill\u2026all the way through me\u2019 \n(p. 13). Inspired by the magic show the two women have just watched together, \nTamar snaps her fingers and makes a coin vanish, then kisses Sofia on the lips and \nruns off, disappearing into her flat with the exclamation \u2018Abracadabra!\u2019 (p. 14). Given \nthis, Hankus\u2019s performance of the same \u2018vanishing groszy trick\u2019 bespeaks her own as \nyet unacknowledged desires (p. 91). That Hankus\u2019s passion for magic articulates a \ntaboo passion for women which resists heteronormativity is likewise suggested by one \nof the objects on which she chooses to practice conjuring: \u2018I can clap my hands and \nmake whole wedding cakes disappear\u2019 (p. 112).  In addition, when Hankus vanishes \nherself she unconsciously positions herself as a non-normative subject by embracing \nthe invisibility that, according to Castle, defines lesbian existence. Significantly, even \nthough Hankus\u2019s disappearing act appears to perpetuate lesbian invisibility, her \nconstant return marks the insistent affirmation of dissident desire.   \nIn The Escape Artist magic is aligned with gender non-conformity as well as \nsame-sex desire, making it a signifier of identities that are not only lesbian but queer. \n 8 \nThrough Hankus, her cross-dressing protagonist, Katz participates in and celebrates a \ntradition of Jewish transvestism epitomized by Sarah Bernhardt (1844-1923) and \nMolly Picon (1898-1992). Bernhardt, the most famous actress of her day, took a \nnumber of male roles, including Shylock. Likewise, Picon - the star of Yiddish \nmusical theatre - was renowned for playing boys.24 However, the most famous \nexample of Jewish transvestism is found in Isaac Bashevis Singer\u2019s short story \u2018Yentl \nthe Yeshiva Boy\u2019 (1962), popularized by Barbra Streisand\u2019s film Yentl (1983), which \nfollows the adventures of a Jewish girl who passes as a boy in order to gain access to \nthe traditionally male sphere of  religious scholasticism. Like Yentl, Hankus is \nliberated from the literal and metaphorical constraints imposed on women by female \nattire. As Sofia explains, \u2018You didn\u2019t mind the clothing part. You welcomed it, in fact. \nThe dresses and pinafores you wore back at home always left you feeling confined\u2019 \n(p. 88). Transvestism permits Hankus the freedoms enjoyed by men: \u2018you were a \nwoman unfettered by silk stockings and garters, free, it seemed, to walk the cobbled \nstreets alone, day or night\u2019 (p. 142). Moreover, cross-dressing suggests that gender, \nlike magic, is an illusion. Just as Max and Motke encourage Hankus to \u2018practice\u2019 the \nart of illusionism (p. 90), so her masquerade as a man reveals that gender is a \npretence, a series of acts made to seem real by repetition. Indeed, in Excitable Speech \n(1997), Judith Butler adopts magic as a metaphor for the performativity of gender \nwhen she relates Bourdieu\u2019s concept of \u2018social magic\u2019 (the term he employs to \ncharacterize the way that certain kinds of speech act acquire the force of authority) to \nthe body: \u2018The way in which the interpellative call continues to call, to take form in a \nbodily stylistics that, in turn, performs its own social magic constitutes the tacit and \ncorporeal operation of performativity\u2019.25 Demonstrating that performativity works \n 9 \n\u2018social magic\u2019 by producing what it names, in The Escape Artist a few careful \nsartorial choices transform Hankus into \u2018a regular Jewish guy\u2019 (p. 98). \n \nIn its ability to apparently accomplish the impossible, magic articulates the \nsubversive possibilities of same-sex desire, non-normative genders, and queer \ndiasporas. Castle notes that, historically, lesbianism has appeared in culture only \u2018as \nan absence, as chimera or amor impossibilia - a kind of love that, by definition, \ncannot exist\u2019.26 Reflecting this, the opening line of \u2018Zeitl and Rickel\u2019 (1968) frames \nSinger\u2019s story about two Jewish lesbians in terms of impossibility: \u2018I often hear \npeople say \u201cThis cannot happen, that cannot be, nobody has ever heard of such a \nthing, impossible!\u201d\u2019.27 Although the narrator contests this view, the impossible is \nassociated with sin and evil \u2013 \u2018My grandmother used to say, \u201cIf the devil wants to, he \ncan make two walls come together\u2026\u201d\u2019 (p. 111) \u2013 and the impossibility of lesbian love \nis underlined when the story ends with the suicide of both women who, invoking the \nur-text of tragic queerness, Radclyffe Hall\u2019s The Well of Loneliness (1928), throw \nthemselves down the village well. Likewise, in Gender Trouble (1990), Butler \nproposes that gender identities that fail to conform to the norms of cultural \nintelligibility appear only as \u2018logical impossibilities\u2019 within a heteropatriarchal \ndomain,28 and Gopinath asserts that queer female subjectivity is \u2018impossible and \nunimaginable within conventional diasporic and national imaginaries\u2019 that are \ndependent on and reinforce heteropatriarchal structures of kinship and community.29\n \n  \nInitially, The Escape Artist seems to illustrate the transgressive possibilities of \ndiaspora that, as Meg Wesling notes, are often asserted in queer diaspora studies.30 \nHaving been abducted by Tutsik Goldenberg, who lures Sofia\u2019s parents into \n 10 \nrelinquishing her into his care with the promise of marriage, Sofia is accompanied on \nher journey to Buenos Aires by Sara, a prostitute who masquerades as Tutsik\u2019s aunt. \nThe subversion of the norms of gender and sexual desire permitted by migration is \nepitomised by Sofia\u2019s response to the sight of Sara smoking a cigar, a pleasure \nnormally reserved for men, in the private coach that whisks them away from Warsaw \ntowards the port: \u2018In spite of my terror I found this absolutely thrilling\u2026I felt a \nsudden desire for her to eat me alive\u2019 (p. 35). Later, when Sara seduces Sofia on the \nship, the boundaries of nation and desire are traversed simultaneously, exemplifying \nthe liberation of the \u2018sexile\u2019, a queer figure who finds freedom in transnational \nmobility.31\n \n Once ensconced in the brothel, Sofia is educated in the \u2018business of sexual \npleasure\u2019 by Tutsik\u2019s sister Madam Perle (p. 58), the woman rumoured to have been \n\u2018George Sand\u2019s favourite lover\u2019 and who reads her \u2018verses by the Greek poet Sappho\u2019 \n(p. 66; p. 59).  However, endorsing Gopinath\u2019s thesis that diaspora endorses \nnormative gender and sexual arrangements, Katz\u2019s novel underlines the gendered \nconditions of migration and forms of labour undertaken by women in the Jewish \ncommunity of Beunos Aires: Sofia is tricked into leaving home and imprisoned in a \nbrothel where she is forced into compliance with compulsory heterosexuality by being \nmade to serve as a sex slave. The purpose of Sofia\u2019s \u2018education\u2019 is to prepare her for \nmale clients (p. 55), and once she begins work her intimate liaisons with Sara and \nPerle cease. Thus The Escape Artist questions the notion that migration engenders \nemancipation for queer subjects. \nTutsik likewise demonstrates that conservative models of gender and desire \nprevail in the Jewish diaspora. Tutsik, a \u2018dandy\u2019 (p. 29) and a \u2018mama\u2019s boy\u2019 (p. 67), \nwho is always \u2018spotless\u2019 and \u2018neat-as-a-pin\u2019 (p. 16; p. 67), takes \u2018little pleasure\u2019 in \n 11 \nlooking at women and finds himself \u2018just a little too excited at the thought of seeing a \nman\u2019s penis\u2019 (p. 67; p. 68). Yet he represses same-sex longing and staves off \nsuspicions roused by his effeminacy by self-consciously adopting the key signifiers of \nheterosexual masculinity: sexual dominance and violence against women. He learns \n\u2018how to look a woman up and down\u2019 (p. 67), and \u2018how to hide and handle a \nblackjack\u2019 and a \u2018sharp knife\u2019 (p. 68). Further, Tutsik\u2019s response to the revelation that \nHankus is a woman and that Sofia and Hankus are lovers - \u2018Impossible!\u2019 (p. 267) - not \nonly echoes the opening of \u2018Zeitl and Rickel\u2019 but also illustrates Gopinath\u2019s point that \nthe patriarchal and heterocentric logic at the heart of conventional formulations of \ndiaspora renders same-sex desire between women unimaginable. In this context, \nmagic, the achievement of apparently impossible feats, articulates a longing for the \nrealization of what Gopinath terms \u2018impossible desires\u2019. By making the impossible \npossible, conjuring and escapology resist a conception of diaspora that renders queer \nwomen inconceivable.32\n \n \nDespite the apparently empowering potential of magic, The Escape Artist \nsuggests that the freedoms secured through prestidigitation are ultimately illusory \nrather than real. The dangers of false forms of freedom are epitomized by the novel\u2019s \nvarious \u2018escape artists\u2019. Seeking diversion from the horrors of her life in the brothel \nthrough opium, Sara wastes away and develops a \u2018dead look in her eyes\u2019 (p. 77), and \nsuicide is \u2018a secret key she keeps tucked behind her tongue\u2019 (p. 78). Tutsik wants \nHankus to make him rich, enabling his escape from financial dependence on Perle: \n\u2018You will be my key to freedom\u2019 (p. 112). Perle seeks to escape the sins of prostitute \nand madam by building a grand synagogue: \u2018Through this excellent deed, Perle \nGoldenberg would at last be liberated from the old ghosts if Poland\u2026.she would shed \n 12 \nher old sin-filled skin like the moth-eaten fur coat it had become, and stand before \nGod naked and renewed\u2019 (p. 116). Yet the novel stresses that magic is \u2018fake\u2019 (p. 12): \nMax and Motke teach Hankus to \u2018secretly pick a lock so it looked like you did it by \nmagic\u2019 (p. 89); Hankus\u2019s clothes have \u2018hidden pockets\u2019 and long sleeves \u2018to hide your \npick locks, your matches, your white doves and roses\u2019 (p. 96; p. 141), and she carries \n\u2018marked cards\u2019 (p. 109); the theatre where she performs her first major show also has \na \u2018false floor\u2019 and \u2018trap doors\u2019 (p. 231). Sofia recognizes that the \u2018fabulous world\u2019 \nconjured by Hankus is not real but \u2018a kind of romance\u2019 (p. 121). Also, underlining the \ncounterfeit quality of magic, on the night that Hankus rescues Sofia from the brothel, \nshe masquerades as \u2018Dr Katterfelto\u2019 (p. 211), a Prussian conjurer whose name has \nbecome synonymous with charlatanism. By stressing that magic is a sham, Katz \nimplicitly subverts the anti-Semitic stereotype of the \u2018Magic Jew\u2019, a figure said to \ndeploy special powers in nefarious plots to take over the world, whilst also \nquestioning the subversive potential of models of queer diaspora that, like magic, \nexclude or elide women.33\n \n  \nFor women, the subversive or empowering potential of magic is compromised \nby its androcentricism. For example, as Mangan notes, escapalogy is considered \u2018a \nparticularly masculine mode of magic performance, demanding muscularity, physical \nprowess and what Conan Doyle called \u2018the essential masculine quality of courage\u2019.34 \nWhile Hankus\u2019s female sex subverts this essentialism, the necessity of passing as a \nman in order to practice magic endorses Karen Beckman\u2019s assertion that the magic \nstage is \u2018a site of patriarchal authority\u2019.35  While several women perform magic in the \nnovel, the status of magician is reserved for men:  Tamar executes the vanishing \ngroszy trick, Marianna works \u2018a magic of her own\u2019 when she lays the table on the eve \n 13 \nof Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year (p. 122), Madam Perle practices \u2018carnal \nsorcery\u2019 (p. 159), and Sofia performs narratorial sleight of hand by withholding \ninformation from the reader at various points in the novel. Nonetheless, women, when \nallowed on stage at all, are relegated to the traditional female role of glamorous \nassistant. Illustrating that magic maintains conservative gender roles, Perle, who \naspires to be \u2018a man\u2019s footstool in heaven\u2019 (p. 158), says of her forthcoming marriage \nto a rabbi in Europe: \u2018you will feel the magic of our union all the way here in Beunos \nAires\u2019 (p. 159). Further, magic, as practiced by men, demands the subjugation of \nwomen\u2019s bodies. In Warsaw, Sofia and Tamar watch a magician saw a woman in half; \nTutsik\u2019s \u2018magic act\u2019 involves the deception of women who are lured into sexual \nservitude (p. 105) - the chapter that describes his abduction of Sofia is titled \n\u2018Transatlantic Wedding Trick\u2019 (p. 25) \u2013 and, pointing to his penis, Sofia\u2019s first \u2018client\u2019 \ninstructs her, \u2018Lie down on the bed little virgin, and I\u2019ll show you the tricks it can do\u2019 \n(p. 63). \n \nIllustrating that conjuring is complicit with male hegemony, The Escape Artist \nsuggests that magic maintains female invisibility. Beckman notes that the vanishing \nlady trick, first performed in 1886, found popularity in a period when women in \nBritain and the United States were campaigning for equal rights. According to \nBeckman, the vanishing lady not only reflects a desire to make the emerging political \nvoices of women disappear, but also \u2018participates in a misogynistic discourse that \nfantasizes the complete eradication of all women\u2019.36 Exemplifying this point, Tutsik \nignores women, \u2018as if we\u2019, Sofia states, \u2018the women of the house, were invisible and \nhis food and drink\u2026appeared by magic\u2019 (p. 21). Likewise, after escaping from the \nbrothel and becoming Hankus\u2019s assistant, Sofia realizes that her role as assistant is \n 14 \noverlooked, despite its significance: \u2018to be the man was to get all the glory, but \nwithout the woman, what would he be but sawing an empty box?\u2019 (p. 232). She is \n\u2018horrified and insulted\u2019 when her name hardly appears in the publicity for their show \n(p. 236). While Hankus apologizes for this, her desire for fame compels a continued \ncollusion with patriarchy. Demonstrating Wesling\u2019s point that the mobility of \ndiasporic subjects may be queer, but it is not necessarily disruptive of dominant \nideologies,37\n \n as a magician Hankus appropriates rather than subverts male privilege \nuntil she relinquishes her ambition and abandons her career as a magician in favour of \na life of equality with her lover.  \nThe Escape Artist also resists the androcenticism of the world of magic by \noffering a feminist revision of Singer\u2019s The Magician of Lublin (1960). In Gopinath\u2019s \nterms, Katz\u2019 treatment of Singer\u2019s novel can be understood as a diasporic \u2018translation\u2019 \nthat \u2018instantiates new regimes of sexual subjectivity even as it effaces earlier erotic \narrangements\u2019.38 There are broad parallels between the two texts: like Singer\u2019s \nprotagonist Yasha Mazur, Hankus is a Polish acrobat, illusionist and escapologist who \nlongs for fame but ultimately renounces magic. However, Katz subverts the gender \nroles in Singer\u2019s story. Yasha\u2019s insistence on male superiority and sexual difference - \n\u2018what could a mere woman know of the male appetite?\u201939 - is undermined in Katz\u2019s \nnovel by the fact that Hankus, who is female, shares his physical abilities and sexual \ndesires. Katz also rewrites the fate of Singer\u2019s female characters. Envying Yasha\u2019s \nliberty, his lover Zeftel longs to be a man.40 Hankus not only achieves Zeftel\u2019s dream \nof freedom by passing as a man, she also fulfils the artistic potential of Magda, \nYasha\u2019s assistant. Magda demonstrates considerable physical agility, turning \nsomersaults and spinning a barrel on her feet but is never permitted to be the star of \n 15 \nthe show and, endorsing Evelyn Torton Beck\u2019s point that strong, assertive and \nindependent women always come to a bad end in Singer\u2019s fictional world,41\n \n \nultimately commits suicide. In contrast, Hankus develops her conjuring and acrobatic \nskills to assume centre stage. \nIn her revision or \u2018translation\u2019 of The Magician of Lublin, Katz challenges the \npatriarchal paradigms endorsed by both the world of magic and Singer himself.  \nWhereas the lustful Yasha resents what he perceives as the \u2018enslaving power\u2019 of \nwomen,42 The Escape Artist makes clear, through its depiction of the horrors of the \nlives of women imprisoned  in the brothel, that it is women who are enslaved and \nsexually exploited by men.  Beck notes that anger at the desire aroused by women is a \npersistent theme in Singer\u2019s fiction,43 and Yasha sadistically punishes his lovers \nmentally and physically for the control that he is convinced they exert over him. \nHowever, according to Singer, this only makes Yasha\u2019s many mistresses love him \nmore. In contrast to The Magician of Lublin, in which Yasha, however mean and \naggressive, is presented as irresistibly attractive to emotionally weak and masochistic \nwomen, The Escape Artist refuses to romanticize male violence: the manipulative and \nabusive Tutsik, although \u2018a handsome man\u2019 (p. 14), is \u2018detestable\u2019 (p. 21) and \n\u2018horrible\u2019 (p. 28). Further, in contrast to Singer who, Mark Spilka argues, not only \nsympathises with his heroes, but also relishes the punishment of his sensual female \ncharacters,44 Katz celebrates female sexuality and punishes Tutsik, who is shot by \nMarek Fishbein, \u2018gangster and kingpin of the Buenos Aires flesh trade\u2019 (p. 200). In \naddition, while evil is personified as a woman, a \u2018she-devil\u2019, and the demonic is \n\u2018whorish\u2019 in The Magician of Lublin,45 The Escape Artist humanizes \u2018whores\u2019 by \ntelling the story of vulnerable and sexually exploited women from a female \n 16 \nperspective. Finally, whereas Yasha eventually chooses to abjure women on the \ngrounds that they represent temptation and sin, Hankus ultimately embraces \nwomanhood when she relinquishes her career as a magician and ceases to pass as a \nman.  \n \nSince conjuring and escapology offer only the illusion of liberation in The \nEscape Artist, Hankus must forsake magic before real freedom can be achieved. \nLikewise, although Sofia initially plans to \u2018trap\u2019 and \u2018trick\u2019 (that is, blackmail) \nHankus into helping her escape from the brothel (p. 164), after they kiss, she no \nlonger thinks of Hankus as \u2018my key to freedom\u2019 but \u2018my darling\u2019 (p. 172). When she \nand Hankus flee the gangster dens of Buenos Aires for Moisesville, they give up the  \ntricks that help to maintain the illusion of heteronormativity in order to embrace \nqueerness. Even though Sofia continues to refer to her lover by the name she first \nknows her, Hankus registers at the People\u2019s Housing Authority in Rosario as \n\u2018Hannah\u2019 (p. 281), indicating that she no longer identifies as a man. Yet, although \nnow living as a woman, Hankus still makes use of her skills as an escapologist by \nbecoming the village locksmith, a job traditionally reserved for men. Likewise, Sofia \nescapes both a life of \u2018tricks\u2019 (\u2018trick\u2019 being the slang term for a prostitute\u2019s client) and \nthe norms of gender and sexual identity enforced by prostitution to become a gaucho \nfarmer and \u2018cowboy\u2019 (p. 93), a figure who has achieved iconic status as a queer \nsubject, as the front cover of Del LaGrace Volcano and Judith Halberstam\u2019s The Drag \nKing Book (1999) attests.46\n \n  \nSuch a conclusion makes Katz\u2019s novel a subversive sequel to Sholom Asch\u2019s \nThe God of Vengeance (1907), a play about two women brought together by a \n 17 \nbrothel.47 When Yekel, who runs a bordello below his family home, discovers that his \ndaughter (Rivkele) has entered into a relationship with a prostitute (Manke), he \nbanishes her downstairs, an action meant as punishment but one that permits the \nlovers to continue their relationship, albeit within the confines of the brothel. \nProstitution is not glamorized and Yekel is punished for his corruption by losing his \ndaughter. Arguing that the play offers a sympathetic portrayal of its lesbian \ncharacters, Alpert imagines the lovers running away and speculates about the life they \nshare \u2018after their escape from the brothel\u2019.48\n \n The Escape Artist transforms Alpert\u2019s \nspeculation into a story, expanding the subversive potential of Asch\u2019s play through an \nending that features the lovers living happy and free.  \nFurther, in contrast to Streisand\u2019s film Yentl, which, as Marjorie Garber notes, \nresolves gender confusion when the eponymous protagonist reverts to conventional \nfemale attire,49 The Escape Artist subverts rather than reasserts the binary structures \nof gender when Hankus ceases to cross-dress. In both Singer\u2019s story and Streisand\u2019s \nfilm the transvestite subject that generates what Garber terms a \u2018category crisis\u2019 \nultimately disappears whereas the queerness of Katz\u2019s central characters is amplified \nrather than elided in the concluding part of the novel when Hankus and Sofia forgo \npassing for tresspassing. Highlighting the fluidity of gender, the women look like \u2018two \nbrothers\u2019 (p. 221) during the escape from the brothel and then like \u2018sisters\u2019 (p. 281) as \nthey board the train out of Buenos Aires. Demonstrating the mutability and \nmultiplicity of gender, at Moisesville, Hankus wears either \u2018a long skirt\u2019 or a \u2018linen \nshirt\u2019 and \u2018black trousers\u2019 (p. 282), and Sofia dons \u2018proper gaucho cothes: a broad-\nbrimmed hat, wide pants, a jacket made of wool\u2019 (p. 93; p. 282). By blending \nmasculinity and femininity, Hankus and Sofia reinvent the vanishing lady trick, \n 18 \nperforming real magic when their queerness takes the mutually exclusive binary \ncategories of gender to vanishing point. Herein, the novel suggests, lies the promise of \ntrue freedom. Whereas the escape artist, as Adam Philips notes, \u2018takes it for granted \nthat getting free is the adventure\u2019,50\n \n by giving up magic, Hankus trades breaking free \nbeing free. As the last line of the novel - \u2018Now at last we are free\u2019 (p. 283) - indicates, \nliberation can only be achieved only when the restrictive binary categories of gender \nthat underpin heteropatriarchy are vanished.  \nBy making Moisesvilles their \u2018new home\u2019 (p. 281), Hankus and Sofia \ndemonstrate that queer diasporas challenge established models of both diasporic and \nqueer experience. Initially, Sofia thinks of herself as an \u2018exile\u2019 (p. 13). She is \n\u2018heartbroken\u2019 to be taken from Warsaw (p. 13), and the name given to the theatre that \nthe Varsovia Society builds for the Jewish community of Buenos Aires \u2013 the \u2018Broken \nHeart Theatre\u2019 (p. 201) \u2013 suggests that her sadness and sense of loss are shared by \nmany.  Yet, supporting Gopinath\u2019s contention that \u2018queer desire reorients the \ntraditionally backward-looking glance of diaspora\u2019,51 whereas Tutsik and Perle \nnostalgically long for the \u2018old country\u2019 (p. 183), Sofia and Hankus make a life for \nthemselves in the New World. In the context of the novel\u2019s moment of publication, \nshortly after Eliezer Schweid\u2019s assertion that Jews should negate the Diaspora by \nsupporting the establishment of Israel as the Jewish national homeland,52 Katz\u2019s \nresistance to the notion of home as a place to which Jews \u2018return\u2019, as enshrined in \nIsrael\u2019s Law of Return, echoes the post-Zionist queer perspective advanced by \nLawrence Schimel and Judith Butler.53 Motke defines Moisesville as \u2018like Palestine \nonly without the religious clap-trap\u2019 (p. 94), and Sofia\u2019s description of the settlement \nas \u2018the new Zion on the pampas\u2019 underlines the possibility of multiple centres of \n 19 \nJewish life (p. 96). Like Schimel, The Escape Artist also questions the location of a \nqueer home in the metropolis. Whereas gay men and lesbians have historically tended \nto gravitate towards urban centres in the U.K. and the U.S.,54\n \n Hankus and Sofia \nreverse the conventional trajectory of queer migrations by moving from the city to the \ncountry, Moisesville being a small rural community in the farmlands of Sante Fe.   \nThe Escape Artist not only relocates but also reinvents home, a site from \nwhich, as Anne-Marie Fortier notes, queer subjects are often excluded. According to \nFortier, for queer subjects who feel exiled or estranged from the heterosexual family, \nhome is \u2018not an origin but a destination\u2019.55 Home is \u2018mobile\u2019 and always \u2018in the \nmaking\u2019, part of \u2018an ongoing process of becoming\u2019.56 Likewise, The Escape Artist \nsuggests that for queer diasporic subjects freedom is achieved not by leaving home, as \nin the tradition of Western \u2018coming out\u2019 narratives, but by \u2018coming home\u2019, as Fortier \nsuggests, or rather by \u2018coming homo\u2019, that is, by re-making home in all its forms \u2013 \nfamily, community, nation - so that it accommodates queerness. The transformation of \nhome in Katz\u2019s novel is symbolized by the contrast between the Shabbes dinners near \nthe beginning and end of the narrative. At one, Sofia is exhorted to act like a \u2018lady\u2019 (p. \n16), forced to wear \u2018lipstick\u2019 (p. 16), and promised in marriage to Tutsik, whereas \nHankus and Sofia share the other with their Moisesville neighbours in the home they \ninhabit together. The woman who registers Hankus and Sofia in Rosario may \u2018stare\u2019 \nin disbelief when they give their full names (p. 282), making clear their intention to \nset up home together not as sisters (because they have different surnames), but the \nShabbes dinner described in the \u2018Epilogue\u2019 suggests that in Moisesville the lovers find \nacceptance, even though transvestism and homosexuality are forbidden by Jewish \nlaw.57  Earlier in the novel such laws lead Max and Motke to consider dressing \n 20 \nHankus as a boy a \u2018shandeh, a shame and a sin\u2019 (p. 93), and prompt Sofia to recognize \nthat while Perle wears \u2018fringed tsitsits close to her body, like a man\u2019 she will be \nforced to \u2018eschew these male accoutrements\u2019 upon marriage (p. 190). Likewise, \nTutsik is enraged by the suggestion that Hankus, who has small wrists and refuses to \nhave sex with a prostitute, is a \u2018fag\u2019 (p. 167). However, the Shabbes dinner that \nHankus and Sofia enjoy with neighbours suggests the successful integration of \nsexuality and ethnicity, and confirms their home in Moisesville as a site where cross-\ngender identification and same-sex desire are affirmed, bearing out Motke\u2019s view that \nMoisesville offers the opportunity to create \u2018a new way of life\u2019 (p. 93). Thus, \nexemplifying the pattern of queer diasporic narratives identified by Gopinath, in The \nEscape Artist home is mourned then reimagined, or \u2013 to use Gopinath\u2019s own term - \n\u2018conjured\u2019 into being.58\n \n \nThe Shabbes dinner at Moisesville also confirms Naomi Scheman\u2019s \nobservation that contemporary Jewish lesbian fiction is characterized by its central \ncharacters\u2019 \u2018(re)discovery and (re)affirmation of their Jewishness, not, as one might \nexpect, a new or heightened estrangement from it\u2019.59 At the same time, neither \nHankus nor Sofia adhere strictly to Judaism. In contrast to the Old World, to which \nthe increasingly pious and conservative Perle returns, the New World is presented as a \nsite where Jewishness, like home, can be refashioned. Supporting Gopinath\u2019s \nassertion that queer diasporic subjects articulate new modes of collectivity and \nkinship that reject ethnic and religious absolutism (p. 20), Hankus is a \u2018New World \nJew\u2019 who gives up eating kosher food and observes Jewish holidays \u2018in his heart\u2019 (p. \n98). Also, like the other Jews of Argentina, Hankus and Sofia engage syncratically \nwith a Hispanic national culture. Hybridity is epitomized by Marianna\u2019s \u2018Spanish-\n 21 \nJewish cooking\u2019 (p. 168), which encompasses \u2018the best of all worlds\u2019 (p. 77), Perle\u2019s \nwedding veil - \u2018a combination of traditional Spanish styling\u2026and Eastern European \nwedding ritual\u2019 (p. 181) \u2013 and Moisesville, known as \u2018Palestine on the pampas\u2019 (p. \n94).  Hybridity is reflected in the language of the novel, which blends English and \nYiddish to create Yinglish, which is combined with Spanish. As the title of the \nepilogue that describes the couples\u2019 happy life in Moisesville suggests, hybridity \noffers a route to liberation: \u2018El Escape Maravilloso Final\u2019 (p. 279).  \n \nHybridity and queerness are both reflected in the style of the novel, which is \nwritten with \u2018the bent notes and dizzying rhythms of a klezmer tune\u2019.60 The \nimportance of klezmer is underscored by Hankus\u2019s name, which invokes Hankus \nNetsky, director of the Klezmer Conservatory Band, founded in 1980. In Klezmer \nAmerica (2008), Jonathan Freedman employs \u2018klezmer\u2019 as a term to describe the \ndistinctive quality of the Jewish interface with American modernity.61 Noting that \ntraditional Yiddish music is a \u2018resolutely impure cultural form\u2019,62 one influenced by \nJazz and, in the 1990s, increasingly by music from Central and Latin America,63 \nFreedman adopts klezmer as a metaphor for the heterogeneity, multiplicity, and \nhybridity of Jewish culture.64 Further, citing the Klezmatics as an example of a band \nthat intertwines the queer, the diasporic, and the Jewish,65 Freedman argues that \nKlezmer epitomizes the \u2018syncretism of a queer diasporism\u2019 that challenges simple, \nreductive, conceptions of national, ethnic, racial or religious identity.66 Written in the \n1990s, a decade that witnessed both the revival and revision of klezmer music, The \nEscape Artist is a \u2018klesmerical\u2019 novel that exemplifies what Freedman terms \n\u2018postklezmer radical Jewish culture\u2019.67 However, while Freedman\u2019s account of queer \ndiasporic Jewish culture is theorised principally through male klezmer musicians and \n 22 \nthe plays of Tony Kushner, Katz\u2019s woman-centred novel embodies a queer diasporic \naesthetic and politics that is emphatically \u2018klezbian\u2019. \n \nAs a historical novel, a feminist counter-history of Jewish migration that \nconjures up queer figures lost in or erased by heteropatriarchal accounts of the past, \nThe Escape Artist exemplifies Gopinath\u2019s point that an archive of queer diasporic \nexperience \u2018allows us to memorialize the violences of the past while also imagining \n\u2018other ways of being in the world\u2019.68 As Sarah Waters notes, throughout the twentieth \ncentury, lesbian writers have enjoyed a \u2018special affinity\u2019 with historical fiction, a \nrelationship that stems from the desire to \u2018map an alternative historical landscape\u2019 that \noffers a redemptive recuperation of non-normative social and sexual arrangements \nsuppressed or elided in the \u2018traditional male-centred historical narrative\u2019.69  In The \nEscape Artist, this is particularly clear in the novel\u2019s treatment of the \u2018white slave \ntrade\u2019. As well as rewriting \u2018Yentl\u2019 and The Magician of Lublin, Katz invokes and \nrevises Singer\u2019s \u2018Hanka\u2019 (1974), a short story set in Buenos Aires, which alludes to \n\u2018gruesome tales\u2019 about a pimp who \u2018would carry a poor girl, an orphan, away to this \nwicked city and try to seduce her with baubles and promises, and, if she did not give \nin, with blows\u2019,70 and Scum (1991), a novel about a man who returns from Buenos \nAires to Poland, where he becomes embroiled in the sexual trafficking of women.71\n \n \nDespite Singer\u2019s enduring interest in prostitution, the unfortunate fate of women sold \ninto brothels is never the main focus of his tales. In contrast, in The Escape Artist the \nfemale story is primary: Sofia\u2019s tale opens the novel and she relates it in her own \nvoice, transforming the prostitute from a passive sexual object to an active subject in \ncharge of her own narrative.  \n 23 \nThe \u2018white slave trade\u2019 also features in Sholom Aleichem\u2019s short story \u2018A \nMan from Buenos Aires\u2019 (1909), which hints that its mysterious central character, a \nrich businessman who refuses to reveal  what he buys and sells, is a sex trafficker or \n\u2018white slaver\u2019.72 As Nora Glickman notes, this character is \u2018glamorized\u2019 by \nAleichem\u2019s story.73\n \n The narrator finds him \u2018good company\u2019 and, as he boasts of \nsuccess, he appears to grow, \u2018younger, handsomer\u2019 (p. 128; p. 138). Like Aleichem\u2019s \nman from Buneos Aires, Tutsik wears a diamond ring and, just as the narrator of \nAleichem\u2019s story wonders if his companion deals in \u2018false diamonds\u2019 (p. 136), so \nTutsik falsely claims to export \u2018diamonds and other fine jewels\u2019 (p. 18). However, in \ncontrast to Aleichem, Katz shifts the narrative focus from pimp to prostitute, \nhighlighting the brutal and degrading reality of her life. Further, Katz undercuts \nAleichem\u2019s glamorization of a man who profits from sexual slavery: although Tutsik \nlooks like \u2018a real gentleman\u2019, he is a psychotic thug, \u2018a lady killer in the truest sense \nof the word\u2019 who enjoys the \u2018thud, the slap, the crunch and pop of real muscle and \nbone\u2019 (p. 104).  \nWhile The Escape Artist offers a woman-centred revision of patriarchal \naccounts of the past and recovers queers hidden from history, it also entails a queer-\nying of the discourse of history itself. In Queer Fictions of the Past (1997), Scott \nBravmann proposes that narratives about gay men and lesbians that are animated by \npostmodern theories of history are \u2018performative\u2019 rather than descriptive in the sense \nthat they reconstruct rather than chronicle the past.74 Rejecting the search for \nhistorical certainty, queer fictions of the past are speculative, suggest that truth is \nsubjective and provisional, and refuse to adhere to the codes of realist representation. \nReflecting this, Katz establishes a non-realist frame for her story and challenges \n 24 \nhierarchies of historical knowledge that privilege fact over fiction by using a \nquotation from Rukeyser\u2019s Houdini: A Musical as an epigraph. The narrative also \nsuggests that the past is invented. Sofia imagines scenes she has not witnessed, such \nas Tutsik\u2019s discovery of her escape from the brothel, and the meeting in which \nFishbein and Perle strike a deal over who will act as impresario to Hankus: \u2018I can \nimagine how they worked it\u2019 (p. 163); \u2018in my mind\u2019s eye I saw it all\u2019 (p. 242); \u2018Here \nis what I think happened next\u2019 (p. 259); \u2018Let us now imagine other thugs\u2026as they \nlikely found themselves\u2019 (p. 261). In this way, Sofia\u2019s narrative points to the creative \nprocesses at work in all accounts of the past, which are always constructed through \nacts of interpretation and imagination. Likewise, Sofia\u2019s narrative indicates that the \nfallibility of memory means that all historical narratives are unreliable and \nincomplete: \u2018It was likely damp and chill, but who remembers?\u2019 (p. 51). Similarly, \nbecause certain details of her \u2018actual\u2019 escape from Buenos Aires with Hankus are \u2018no \nmore than a blur in my memory\u2019 (p. 221), Sofia is forced to invent her account of this \nevent. \n \nBravmann argues that \u2018queer fictions of the past are interventions in the \npresent\u2019 and considers \u2018historical representation as a way of struggling over and \naddressing current social problems.75 Similarly, Laura Doan and Sarah Waters \npropose that in recent lesbian historical fiction \u2018history becomes the means to explore \ncontemporary culture\u2019.76 Endorsing this view, in its representation of the \u2018white slave \ntrade\u2019, The Escape Artist can be read as a text concerned with the significant rise in \nthe global trafficking of female sex workers that occurred in the 1990s.77 Following \nthe collapse of Communism and the opening of borders for free trade, the number of \nwomen from Eastern Europe unwittingly recruited or coerced into migratory sex work \n 25 \nreached epidemic proportions. Recent accounts of false promises, abduction, forced \ntransportation to a strange place, isolation, imprisonment, deprivation, abuse, and \nviolence, all echoed in Sofia\u2019s story, support Wesling\u2019s assertion that far from \nconfirming the liberatory potential of a globalization that is celebratorily \u2018queer\u2019, sex \ntrafficking illustrates that migration often endorses normative, patriarchal sexual \narrangements.78\n \n Thus, The Escape Artist refuses to romanticise the disruptive \npotential of migration even as it asserts the transformative possibilities engendered by \nqueer diasporas. \nKatz\u2019s representation of the past also reflects the prevailing concerns of a \nspecifically Argentinean present. Published not long after two terrorist attacks on the \nJews of Buenos Aires (the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in 1992 and a Jewish \ncommunity center in 1994), as a historical novel The Escape Artist represents a desire \nto preserve a community under threat. Further, the novel\u2019s concern with memory \nconnects the history of the diasporic Jewish community of Argentina with that of all \nArgentineans.  Following Argentina\u2019s \u2018Dirty War\u2019 (1976-1983), the campaign of \nstate-sponsored violence against left-wing radicals and suspected subversives (which \nincluded queers), the people of Argentina struggled to resist official attempts to deny \nor erase the crimes of the past.79  As Diana Taylor notes in a book about the \u2018Dirty \nWar\u2019, Disappearing Acts (1997), published the same year as Katz\u2019s novel, following \nthe pardon issued by President Carlos Menem in 1990 to Jorge Rafael Videla, the \nmilitary dictator imprisoned for the human rights abuses carried out by his regime, the \nyears that followed saw a preoccupation with national memory and forgetting.80 \nAlthough set prior to the \u2018Dirty War\u2019, The Escape Artist alludes to this major episode \nin Argentinean history through both the name of its magician and the motif of magic. \n 26 \n\u2018Hankus\u2019 invokes Singer\u2019s \u2018Hanka\u2019, a story set \u2018not long after Peron had been ousted, \nand Argentina was in the midst of a political and perhaps economic crisis\u2019 (p. 10) -  in \nother words, in the period just prior to the advent of the \u2018Dirty War\u2019 - and the \nvanishing tricks that Hankus employs to make himself disappear evoke the term given \nto the thousands of people who were abducted, tortured and murdered during the \n\u2018Dirty War\u2019: \u2018the disappeared\u2019. By drawing parallels between the pogroms enacted \nagainst Jews and Argentineans, The Escape Artist endorses Joan Nestle\u2019s point that to \n\u2018be a Jew is to have a history and to be queer is to have another history, just as to be a \nwoman is to have yet another history\u2026but respect to these stories of oppression and \nresistance is best paid when we refuse to separate them out of the full human story of \nresistance\u2019.81\n \n  \nIn conclusion, in Katz\u2019s novel magic functions as a metaphor for both the \nnegative and positive effects of diaspora. Moreover, conjuring, which represents the \nmiraculous accomplishment of the impossible, and escapology, which symbolizes a \ndesire for freedom, articulate the specific concerns of queer diasporic female subjects \ntrapped in a heteropatriarchal regime that can only conceive same-sex desire in terms \nof impossibility. As Mangan notes, magic offers up the possibility - however light-\nheartedly, however insincerely \u2013 that boundaries may be breached\u2019.82 Nonetheless, as \nhe goes on to observe, and as Katz\u2019s novel demonstrates, magic - like diaspora - often \nconfirms those boundaries that appear to be challenged, and is ultimately conservative \nrather than revolutionary, particularly in terms of gender.83\n \n In contrast, The Escape \nArtist celebrates the truly transformative potential of a queer Jewish diaspora that \naffirms klezbian identity and desire.  \n 27 \n                                                 \n1 Lionel Tiger\u2019s observation that magicians, like mediums, flourish whenever society feels powerless or \noverwhelmed suggests that these texts may be a response to the crisis of the 9\/11 terrorist attacks and \nthe anxiety that defines post-9\/11 culture. However, Chabon\u2019s novel pre-dates 9\/11, suggesting that \nthere is no single explanation for the appeal of magic. Given that Randi avers that war and periods of \neconomic uncertainty \u2018have always been good for the magic business\u2019, it seems likely that more \nrepresentations of magicians may appear in response to the current economic crisis.

Published the same year as The \nEscape Artist, Ann Patchett\u2019s The Magician\u2019s Assistant (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1997) \nalso features a lesbian magician. Set in California, it tells the story of Sabine, a magician\u2019s assistant \nwho, following the death of her partner, Parsifal, takes up magic and falls in love with his sister, Kitty. \n5 Abraham Cahan\u2019s Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto (1896. Gloucester: Dodo Press,  \n2009) is regarded as the classic tale of Jewish migration to the States, but this story has been told many \ntimes, even from a woman-centred perspective, as in Marge Piercy\u2019s Sex Wars (London: Piatkus, \n2005), and from a lesbian perspective, as in Elana Dykewomon\u2019s Beyond the Pale (1997. London: \nOnlywomen Press, 2000). Published the same year as The Escape Artist, Dykewomon\u2019s novel follows \ntwo Jewish women who journey from a Russian shtetl to New York\u2019s Lower East Side. \n6 See Jonathan Freedman, Klezmer America: Jewishness, Ethnicity, Modernity (New York: Columbia \nUniversity Press, 2008), p. 73.

For example, debunking the myth that Jews \nare particularly adept with money, Tutsik wants to be a \u2018respectable businessman\u2019 but is a \u2018financial \nfailure\u2019 (p. 186). Also, while Tutsik conforms to the stereotype of the effeminate Jewish man, Marek \nFishbein subverts it. In contrast to Tutsik, who is \u2018clean\u2019 (p. 16), Fishbein is \u2018filthy\u2019 (p. 139), and where \nTutsik is \u2018tidy and immaculate\u2019 (p. 69), Fishbein is a \u2018slob\u2019 (p. 156), a \u2018mess of a man\u2019 (p. 69).  \n34 Mangan, p. 162. \n35 Karen Beckman, Vanishing Women: Magic, Film and Feminism (Durham: Duke UP, 2003), p. 7. \n36 Beckman, p. 6. \n37 Wesling, pp. 34-5. \n38 Gopinath, p. 14. \n39 Isaac Bashevis Singer, The Magician of Lublin.
