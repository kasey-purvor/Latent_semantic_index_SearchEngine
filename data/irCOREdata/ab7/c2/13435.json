Without this financial support the \nbroad scope of the study would have been particularly difficult. \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \nAmerican research indicates that prison gangs have become a formidable feature of \nmany Federal and State prisons (e.g. Buentello, Fong & Vogel, 1991; Camp & Camp, \n1985; Jacobs, 1977). In the U.K. only one study (Wood & Adler 2001) has directly \nexamined the issue of prison gangs in the English and Welsh prison estate. It revealed \nthat prison staff perceive many gang-related activities as common occurrences in \nEnglish prisons. The present study builds on this knowledge by examining prisoners\u201f \nperceptions of gang-related activities in English prisons. \nThere is no precise definition of a prison gang; some argue (e.g. Fong & \nBuentello, 1991; Huff, 1996) that prison gangs are cohesive groups of prisoners (with a \nleader), whose criminal activities negatively impact on the prisons that hold them. \nOthers contend that prison gangs have a more flexible configuration (e.g. Camp & \nCamp 1985). Also, research has not clarified the minimum number of members for an \noperational definition of a \u201cprison gang\u201d. In light of these gaps in the literature, this \nstudy defined a gang by borrowing from Brown\u201fs (2000) definition of a group and from \nFong and Buentello\u201fs (1991) outline of a prison gang. Brown (2000) defines a group as \nexisting when \u2026 \u201ctwo or more people define themselves as members of it and when its \nexistence is recognised by at least one other.\u201d (p.2-3). For pragmatic purposes, since \nparticipants may not consider two people to be a group, the number used in the current \nstudy was three or more people. A prison gang was therefore defined as a group of three \nor more prisoners whose negative behaviour has an adverse impact on the prison that \nholds them.  \nThe largest survey into the existence of prison gangs reported their presence in \n60% of Federal and State prisons (Camp & Camp, 1985). Prison gangs reportedly \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 4 \nincluded 2% (12,634 prisoners) of the prison population and were thought to be \nresponsible for more than 50% of prison management problems (Camp & Camp, 1985) \nleading in some case to the declaration of a state of emergency (Beaird, 1986; Fong, \n1990). \nPrison gangs have continued to develop into organisations with connections and \nactivities stretching from prison to the community (Fong & Buentello, 1991; Sullivan, \n1991). They function on the acquisition of money and power (Camp & Camp, 1985; \nFong, 1990) and use threats and violence to dominate staff and other prisoners (Huff, \n1996; Irwin, 1980; Stevens, 1997). In the U.S.A. the most common activities of prison \ngangs are reported to be, [in descending order]: intimidation; drug trafficking; assault; \nabuse of weaker prisoners; extortion; protection; contraband weapons; theft; \u201cstrong-\narm robbery\u201d; rackets; robbery; prostitution; rape; \u201csodomy for sale\u201d; murder; bribery; \narson; slavery and explosives (Camp & Camp, 1985). Stevens (1997) found that in a \nprison where prison gangs were active 73% of non-gang prisoners wanted a transfer and \n87% would like to ask for protective custody but feared the consequences. Gang \nmembers are uninterested in schemes to earn privileges or address offending behaviour \n(Huff, 1996). However, they generally co-operate with prison staff requests and prison \nrules and only become violent if opposed by prison staff (Camp & Camp 1985). On the \nother hand more recent evidence suggests that gang members are frequently violent and \nconsistently involved in almost all other forms of illicit behaviour (Gaes et al 2002). In \nthe U.K. research reveals high levels of many gang related events such as drug \npossession; groups formed by race; requests for transfers; prisoner\/prisoner assaults; and \nregional affiliations occur across all categories of prison (Wood & Adler, 2001). The \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 5 \nlevels of these activities predicted staff perceptions of reduced order and control in the \nprison. \nNonetheless, there is still a paucity of research into prison gangs. In the U.S.A. \nresearchers note that officials often do not accept that a prison gang problem exists \n(Fong & Buentello, 1991). There is also the difficulty of accessing gang members who \nmay abide by a code of secrecy to protect members from official detection and transfer \nto gang blocks reserved for prison gang members (Camp & Camp, 1985; Fong & \nBuentello, 1991). Calls for a more research-led proactive approach to the management \nof prison gangs have resulted from the recognition that the existence of prison gangs \ntends to be recognised only following a crisis and that rectifying the situation is often \ncostly (Fong & Buentello, 1991). Fong and Buentello (1991) contend that a proactive \napproach would result in research establishing the existence and activities of prison \ngangs before they become organised and possibly disruptive. \nSo far, research has relied mainly on prison staff reports or prison records (e.g. \nCamp & Camp 1985; Fong & Buentello 1991; Huff 1996; Wood & Adler 2001; Gaes et \nal 2002).While staff accounts and records may be useful to begin examining prison \ngangs there will be limitations to the insight prison staff can offer. Canadian research \nindicates that staff awareness of prisoner activity is limited (Cooley 1993). Prison staff \nmay not be fully aware of the frequency with which certain events occur. Similarly, \nproblems such as low morale, lack of job satisfaction, or even stereotypical views of \nprisoners\u201f behaviour may colour staff accounts.  \nThe problems associated with staff perspectives also apply to the use of official \nprison data; a methodology favoured by some (e.g. Camp & Camp 1985; Buentello \nFong and Vogel 1991). If staff assessments of prisoners\u201f behaviour are limited or \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 6 \nflawed, then prison records compiled by staff will reflect those inaccuracies. Also, the \ncontradictory sources of official information available, i.e. log books, landing books, \nobservation books and adjudication data make prison records an erratic source of \nevidence.  \nThe most logical alternative to the above methodologies is to ask prisoners for \ntheir perceptions of \u201egang-related\u201f events in prison. Some American researchers argue \nthat prisoners would not cooperate with this kind of research (e.g. Fong & Buentello \n1991) while others have found that prisoners are willing to report confidentially the \nactivities of prison gangs (e.g. Stevens 1997). Since only a small number of prisoners, \n2% (Camp & Camp 1985) and 10% (Knox 1994) are gang members this means that \nmost prisoners are not prison gang members. If prison gangs are as predatory as the \nliterature suggests then non-gang prisoners are likely to have been victimised by these \ngroups. These prisoners, if assured of confidentiality, may be willing to speak to \nresearchers. Also, even prison gang members may not be as reticent as suggested (e.g. \nFong & Buentello 1991) since Koehler (2000) found that more than 90% of a well \norganised gang were willing to be interviewed about their gang membership but not \nabout involvement in criminal activity. Consequently, this study built on the work of \nWood and Adler (2001) by examining prisoners\u201f perceptions of gang related activity \nand order and control in the prison.  \nAlthough gang related activity in the U.K. may have similar patterns to those \nobserved in the U.S.A. there could also be some fundamental differences. For example, \nAmerican researchers note how prison gangs form along racial lines, just as street gangs \ndo. In the U.K. street gangs form along regional lines (Mares, 2001) and prison gangs \nmay do the same. Also, there are fundamental differences between the American and \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 7 \nEnglish and Welsh prison systems that may influence the existence and\/or emergence of \nprison gangs. For example, in Quentin (a high security establishment) the ratio of \nofficers to prisoners is 1:190 and even in the block where prison gangs are known to be \nactive the ratio is 1:16. In English and Welsh prisons, prisoners experience a greater \nstaff presence than their counterparts in the U.S.A. The official ratio of officers to \nprisoners in England and Wales is one officer per 2.5 prisoners (category B), one officer \nper 1.3 (category C) one officer per 1.9 (YOI) and one officer per 1.9 (females) \n(Function Report, H.M. Prison Service 2005). However, these figures may differ \nbetween wings in different prisons and so some prisoners may have more supervision \nthan others, even within categories. Nevertheless, the suggestion here is that generally \nprisoners in the U.K. are supervised to an extent that may hinder the development and \nfunctioning of prison gangs. \nTaking potential differences into account this study used key indicators of prison \ngang presence identified by Buentello et al (1991) together with items developed for the \nEnglish and Welsh prison system by Wood and Adler (2001). Since staff perceptions of \nprison gang activity related to staff reports of reduced control and order in prison (Wood \n& Adler 2001) this study also aimed to see if prisoners\u201f reports reflected a similar \nrelationship between gang event frequency and perceived order and control.  \nAs previous research notes that category C (medium\/low security); Female \nestablishments (classified as open\/closed: hold females from 15 years old); Young \nOffenders\u201f Institutions (male offenders aged 15-21 years) and Category B prisons \n(medium\/high security) are the establishments particularly vulnerable to gang related \nactivity, these were included in this study. Dispersal prisons (Highest security) and \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 8 \nOpen prisons (Low security) were not included since staff reports indicated lower levels \nof gang-related activity (Wood & Adler, 2001).  \nHowever, it is possible that prisoners\u201f and staff perceptions of gang related activity \nmay differ due to environmental features of the institutions. For instance, some female \nestablishments are designed on the basis of 'houses' and aim to establish a pattern of \n'home' and 'the neighbours' (Kelley 1970). In such a penal structure, gang-related \nactivities may occur in isolated pockets throughout the prison, leaving many prisoners \noblivious to their occurrence, which may be reflected in the levels of events reported. \nPrison staff are unlikely to be equally oblivious since their diverse duties provide them \nwith an overall insight into the prison and its events.  \nDemographic and institutional variables were also examined since American \nresearch indicates that gang members have served more sentences, take more drugs and \nhave longer sentences than non gang prisoners (Sheldon 1991). They are also likely to \nbe younger than non gang prisoners (Ralph, Hunter, Marquart, Cuvelier and Merianos \n1996). If this also applies to the U.K., it could be expected that prisoners most involved \nwill be able to provide the greatest insight into gang related events, since some gang \nrelated events are covert and therefore not as visible to other prisoners or staff. \nSubsequently, younger prisoners, those serving longer sentences, and recidivists may \nreport higher levels of events. Ethnic origin was included due to self-classification \nhaving a possible bearing on how prisoners perceive themselves in terms of race. For \nexample, prisoners of mixed race may consider themselves to be either black or white \nand if prisoner groups form along racial lines as suggested by gang researchers (e.g. \nCamp & Camp 1985) this may influence the prisoner\u201fs choice of associates and the \ninformation they are privy to. \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 9 \nHypotheses: \nH1) Since prison staff reported that gang related events were highest in category C and \nYoung Offender Institutions, it is expected that prisoners will also report these \ncategories as having the highest levels of gang related events. Category B prisoners \nand female prisoners are expected to report the lowest levels of gang related \nactivity.  \nH2) It is expected that prisoners will hold similar perceptions to staff inasmuch as those \nwho perceive high levels of gang related events will also perceive prisoner groups \nas having more control over events in the prison than do staff (prisoner control). \nH3) It is expected that prisoners will hold similar perceptions to staff inasmuch as those \nwho perceive high levels of gang related events will also perceive that staff may not \nmaintain order in the prison (staff order). \nH4) It is expected that prisoners involved in gang related activity will be more aware of \nthe actual levels of gang related activity and so reports of gang related activity will \nbe predicted from demographic and institutional factors such as age, length of \nsentence and recidivism.  \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nThree hundred and sixty prisoners from nine prisons participated (see Table 1 \nfor sample demographics). In eight of the nine prisons every 5th\n \nor 7th prisoner was \nselected from a list of all prisoners. In the ninth prison, prisoners were approached and \nasked to participate by either the researcher or prison staff. Subsequently of the 360 \nprisoners who took part in this study 40 resulted from opportunistic rather than random \nsampling.  \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 10 \nPrisoners held on remand were not selected since they were less likely than \nconvicted prisoners to be aware of other prisoners\u201f activities. Of those asked to take part \nin the research, three prisoners held in category C institutions and two prisoners in the \ncategory B establishment, refused. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTABLE 1 TO GO HERE \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMaterials \nInterview items were based on the extension of Fong et al\u201fs (1991) questionnaire \ndeveloped by Wood and Adler (2001) and adapted for use with prisoners for this study. \nFong et al\u201fs original variables included 11 items assessing: prisoner requests for \nprotective custody, prisoners with tattoos, prisoner disciplinary violations of contraband \npossessions, secret racial groupings of prisoners, the emergence of prisoner cliques, \nphysical assaults on other prisoners, prisoners\u201f involvement in illicit activities with \npeople outside prison, prisoner requests for inter-unit transfers, prisoners\u201f families being \nthreatened by prisoner cliques, verbal threats made to staff by prisoners, physical \nassaults on staff by prisoners. For clarity, Fong and Buentello's (1991) variable \n\u201cprisoner possession of contraband\u201d was divided into four specific variables concerning \npossession of alcohol, drugs, phone cards and tobacco as these were considered to be \nthe most common forms of contraband in English and Welsh prisons. \nVariables added by Wood and Adler (2001) were based on knowledge of the \nEnglish prison system and American findings. Items used to assess the dominance of \nsome prisoners by prisoner groups and the frequency of opposing groups' disputes were \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 11 \nincluded since these are likely to be common examples of group behaviour in prison \n(Wood & Adler 2001). Wood and Adler\u201fs additional items also expanded Fong et al\u201fs \n(1991) racial basis for group formation to include regional and ideological criteria; \nfactors acknowledged as a basis for group formation by American and U.K. researchers \n(e.g. Camp & Camp; 1985, Rush, Stone & Wycoff, 1996; Mares, 2001). For example, \nprisoners were asked to report levels of membership of extreme political organisations \n(e.g. The British National Party) and the domination of prisoners\u201f groups by such \nmembers. Given that concerns and fear over personal safety have been found to \nproliferate in English prisons (Adler, 1998), an item was used to assess prisoners\u201f \nconcerns for their safety. Two variables were used to examine prisoners\u201f perceptions of \norder and control in the prison. The first assessed perceptions that groups of prisoners \nhave more control over events in the prison than do staff and the second assessed \nperceptions that staff may lose control of the prison. These were based on American \nfindings that prison gangs flourish where they can control staff and other prisoners \n(Stevens' 1997) and that prison gang presence leads to a breakdown in order (e.g. Beird \n1986; Fong 1990). The occurrence of the events alone cannot be taken as an indicator of \nprison-gang presence (Fong et al. 1991). If a number of events occur \u201cfrequently\u201d or \n\u201cvery frequently\u201d, or there is a sudden rise in levels of occurrence, then this should give \nrise to concerns that prison gangs may be operating in the prison. Subsequently \nprisoners were asked to report the frequency of each event.  \nInternal reliability analysis indicated that the scale was reliable (\uf061 = .86). \nAlthough prisoners were asked items relating to groups of three or more, the phrase \n\u201cprison gang\u201d was not used. This was to avoid experimental demand i.e. the possibility \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 12 \nthat some prisoners may have preconceived ideas about prison gangs, which could \ninfluence their responses. \nProcedure \nInterviews were conducted individually and in private. Participants were fully \nbriefed of the study's aims and their rights to confidentiality and anonymity before \ninterviews began. At the request of the Prison Service, participants were told before the \ninterview that if they revealed an intention to escape, harm themselves or another \nperson, this information could not remain confidential. To control for an order effect, \nitems on the questionnaires were rotated to produce 4 different versions. Respondents \nwere randomly presented with one of the 4 versions. Questions were read to participants \nto allow for any literacy difficulties and respondents were asked to report only events \nthat had occurred in the current prison within the last six months. Each interview lasted \napproximately 20 minutes after which participants were invited to ask questions before \nbeing debriefed verbally and in writing.  \nRESULTS \nTo get a clearer idea of the type and frequency of gang-related events, the \npercentage of prisoners who reported an event as occurring frequently (11-20 times) or \nvery frequently (more than 20 times) within the preceding 6 months were calculated. As \nTable 2 shows, the event considered by prisoners to be the most frequent was prisoners \npossessing drugs. Other common events seem to function on cohesion of groups or \npossession of material goods and seem to occur more frequently than do events relating \nto domination of, or altercations between, prisoners.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 13 \n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nTo examine categories of prison according to perceptions of gang-related events, \nindividual scores for each event were summed to give a total for each participant. A \none-way ANOVA revealed a difference between perceived levels of events according to \ncategory of prison, F (3,355) = 4.46, p<.005, \u03b7=.04, power = .88. Tukey's post hoc \nanalysis revealed that male prisoners in Categories B (M=58.15), C (M=57.37), and \nYOI (M = 58.17) reported similar levels of events, but female prisoners reported fewer \ngang-related events (M = 51.33) than all other categories.  \nGang events as predictors of reduced order and control in prison \nThe data were analysed to see if prisoners who perceived high levels of gang \nrelated events also perceived high levels of prisoner control and a reduction in staff \norder. Although the variables \u201eprisoner control\u201f and \u201estaff order\u201f were assessed as part \nof the gang events scale they were used only as D.V.\u201fs for the purpose of analysis.   \nPerceptions of \u201eprisoner control\u201f \nTo see if prisoners who perceived high levels of gang related events also \nconsidered prisoner groups to have more control over events in the prison than do staff, \n(prisoner control) a standard regression analysis using gang related events as IV\u201fs and \nprisoner control as the DV was conducted. Results revealed the independent variables \nsuccessfully predicted the DV and explained 13% of the variance (see Table 3). The \nBeta coefficients for the important predictors reveal that as each predictor increases so \ntoo do perceptions that prisoners have more control over events in the prison than do \nstaff.  \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 14 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \nPerceptions of \u201estaff order\u201f \nThe second standard regression analysis used prisoners\u201f perception that staff \nmight not maintain order in the prison\u201f (staff order) as the DV and prisoners\u201f \nperceptions of gang events as the IV\u201fs. Results showed that the IV\u201fs successfully \npredicted the DV accounting for 29% of the variance (see Table 4). Beta values \nindicated, with one exception, that as each IV increases so too do prisoners\u201f perceptions \nthat staff may not maintain order in the prison. The IV prisoners belonging to outside \norganisations dominating prisoner groups has a negative Beta value indicating that this \nvariable has a negative relationship with reduced staff order.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \nPerceptions of gang event frequency and demographic\/institutional characteristics \nA standard regression analysis was used to see if demographic and institutional \ncharacteristics related to prisoners\u201f perceptions of gang events. The total score for \nperceived level as of gang-related events was used as the DV and age, ethnic origin, \ngender, number of prison sentences served and length of the current sentence were used \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 15 \nas IVs. Since 46.4% of participants were serving a first prison sentence the number of \nprison sentences served was split into prisoners serving a first prison sentence (na\u00efve) \nand prisoners serving a subsequent prison sentence (recidivist). The analysis showed \nthat prisoners perceiving the highest levels of gang related events were young, male and \nrecidivists.  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nINSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nDISCUSSION \nThis study had four hypotheses, two were supported by the results and two were \npartially supported. The first hypothesis anticipated that reports of gang-related events \nwould be highest in category C prisons and Young Offender Institutions. Category B \nprisoners\u201f and female prisoners\u201f reports would be the lowest. Only partial support was \nfound for this prediction. Although gang-related events were perceived as more frequent \nin all male categories of prison than they were in female institutions, male institutions \ndid not differ from each other.  \nThis finding echoes American observations that female prisoners are not as involved \nas male prisoners in prison gang activity (e.g. Knox 1994). Female prisoners\u201f reports of \nevents also seem to differ from levels reported by prison staff in the Wood and Adler \n(2001) study. Wood and Adler\u201fs findings suggested that female establishments did not \ndiffer from male establishments with the exception of category C prisons. As noted \nearlier some female establishments reflect a neighbourhood structure (Kelley 1970), \nwhich may mean that gang-related activities occur in isolated pockets leaving some \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 16 \nprisoners less aware of gang related activity than staff. Equally, if the prison replicates a \n\u201eneighbourhood\u201f then cohesive group formation could be a normal feature of the \nenvironment rather than a matter of prisoner choice. Of the two female prisons that took \npart in this study, one was organised according to \u201ehouses.\u201f Hence, it is feasible that the \ninfluence of this one establishment was sufficient to shape the results. \nThe second hypothesis predicted that the frequency of gang related events would \npredict prisoners\u201f perceptions of prisoner groups having more control over events in the \nprison than did staff. This prediction was supported. As expected, gang related variables \npredicted prisoners\u201f perceptions of groups of prisoners having more control over events \nthan do staff. This supports American and British findings that activities associated with \nprison gangs relate to prisoners having increased control over events in the prison \n(Camp & Camp, 1985; Fong & Buentello, 1991; Stevens, 1997; Wood & Adler, 2001).  \nThe key predictors of \u201eprisoner control\u201f included a combination of overt and \ncovert gang-related activities. Overt events included verbal threats to staff and groups of \nprisoners verbally dominating other prisoners. These indicate intimidation of other \nindividuals; a central feature of the prison gang (e.g. Camp & Camp 1985). Another \nimportant predictor of prisoner control was requests for protective custody. This \nsupports previous findings that requests for protective custody rise when prison gangs \nare present due to threats, assaults and intimidation experienced by non gang prisoners \n(Stevens 1997).  \nThe possession of alcohol as an important predictor of \u201eprisoner control\u201f is \ninteresting. Unlike many contraband materials such as drugs, alcohol is a relatively \nbulky product and not easy to conceal so it may require a level of freedom or \nresourcefulness to prevent staff finding it. A certain level of expertise or freedom would \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 17 \nalso be necessary to produce it inside or import it into, the prison. If prisoners have high \nlevels of control over events in the prison, then the procurement and concealment of \nalcohol is likely to be easier. Of course there is always the alternative explanation that in \nan environment where prison staff sense they lack full control, some may be tempted to \noverlook the odd bottle of \u201ehooch.\u201f In such circumstances, it would be surprising if \nprisoners did not report beliefs that prisoners have more control over events in the \nprison than do staff.  \nPrisoners forming close knot groups as a key indicator of \u201eprisoner control\u201f \nwithin the prison is not unexpected. What is not clear is whether close knit groups result \nfrom or contribute to, high levels of \u201eprisoner control.\u201f It is possible that they do both. \nFor example, prisoners intent on gaining and maintaining power may form groups as \nincreased numbers may help achieve this aim. These groups may then begin to exert \ntheir own \u201eprisoner control\u201f as they recognise and capitalise on their potential for power \nwithin the prison. As their control increases other prisoners may band together for \nprotection and more close knit groups develop. Formation of groups for protection from \nthe perceived threat of other groups is well documented in American research (e.g. \nKnox 1994; Klein 1995). As a result they may then develop into a prison gang \n(Buentello et al, 1991). In such an atmosphere it is only to be expected that prisoners \nwould conceive \u201eprisoner control\u201f as high.  \nThe third hypothesis predicted that the frequency of gang related events would \npredict prisoners\u201f perceptions that staff may not maintain order (staff order). This \nprediction was also supported. This supports American and British findings that gang \nactivity is associated with reduced order in the prison (Camp & Camp, 1985; Fong & \nBuentello, 1991; Stevens, 1997; Wood & Adler, 2001). Unsurprisingly, physical \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 18 \nassaults on staff and verbal threats to staff were important predictors of \u201estaff order.\u201f In \nan atmosphere where prisoners feel able to verbally threaten and particularly if they feel \nable to physically assault staff, it could be argued that order is already ebbing away. The \nimportance of more covert variables such as threats to prisoners\u201f families is interesting, \nas it was one of the less frequent activities cited by prisoners. Its importance as a \npredictor of \u201estaff order,\u201f may indicate a subtle effect of gang behaviour on \u201estaff order\u201f \nin the prison. If groups of prisoners threaten prisoners\u201f families, then this is most likely \nto occur during visiting time. This suggests that staff do not have full control over \nprisoners during visits and so do not maintain full order. Other important predictors of \nstaff order included prisoner membership of outside organisations such as the B.N.P., \nprisoners who belong to such organisations dominating prisoners groups and secret \nracial groupings of prisoners. This seems to suggest that there may be racial tensions \nbetween prisoners that are either not detected or not adequately dealt with by staff \nleading to perceptions of a lack of staff order. The nature of the relationship between \nprisoners forming secret racial groupings and the presence and domination of groups by \nindividuals belonging to organisations such as the B.N.P. is not clear. The results \nsuggest that belonging to organisations such as the B.N.P. positively relates to a \nreduction in staff order but domination of prisoner groups by these members negatively \nrelates to reduced staff order. It could be that racial groupings form as a response to the \nperceived threat of white supremacist ideology and so white supremacist ideology is \nunable to gain a foothold where secret racial groupings exist. Equally, it could be that \nwhen prisoners perceive staff as not fully in control of the prison, they perceive other \nprisoners as a greater threat and band together for protective purposes. Either way, these \nfindings give cause for concern that racial tensions may exist or form between prisoners \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 19 \nin an atmosphere where prisoners perceive that prison staff may not maintain order in \nthe prison.  \nThe fourth hypothesis anticipated that Prisoners\u201f perceptions of event frequency \nwould be shaped by their demographic\/institutional characteristics. Ethnic origin and \nlength of sentence did not relate to responses, but age and number of sentences served \nlinked to prisoners\u201f perceptions of gang related events. Younger prisoners reported \nhigher levels of gang related events than did older prisoners. However, this was not \nsufficient to cause a difference between young offender institutions and adult \ninstitutions so it seems that many prisoners perceiving gang events as frequent are over \nthe age of 21. Quite why younger prisoners would report higher levels of gang-related \nevents is not clear. Staff reports indicate that younger prisoners are involved in more \nvisible\/overt gang-related behaviours than older prisoners (Wood & Adler, 2001). It \nmay be the case that the activities of younger prisoners are more easily observed by \ntheir peers and are therefore more easily reported, but this is not limited to young \noffender institutions alone.  \nRecidivists were also more likely to report higher levels of events than were \nna\u00efve or first time prisoners. Recidivists have more experience of in prison life and this \nmay mean they have more awareness of the less obvious gang-related activities. Yet, it \ncould be argued that prisoners serving longer sentences would also have more \nawareness but the results show this is not the case. As speculated earlier, this may be \ndue to personal activity. If recidivists and younger prisoners are more personally \ninvolved in gang related activity, it makes sense that they would be more aware of the \nactual levels of events than non involved prisoners. It would be unrealistic to expect that \neven in a relatively small environment such as a prison that all prisoners would know of \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 20 \nall the activities taking place around them. It is only to be expected that prisoners \ninvolved in illicit activities would try to keep their behaviour as inconspicuous as \npossible to avoid detection by prison staff. As a result, prisoners not involved in the \nevents are unlikely to be aware of the full extent of prison groups\u201f activities. Perhaps \nprisoners who have been victimised may have more awareness, but even they are likely \nto know less than group members, since not all activities involve victimising other \nprisoners. This may be reflected in the current results. Further work would be needed to \nclarify these possibilities. \nAlthough asking prisoners about prisoner activity has the potential to reveal \nimportant information, there will inevitably be limitations. There will be limitations to \nthe amount of information prisoners are prepared to share, the amount of information \nprisoners actually have and the methodological constraints imposed by the questions \nthey are asked. Also, there are likely to be methodological constraints in terms of \nsampling methods. As noted earlier, one of the nine prisons was unable to allow random \nsampling of prisoners and so 40 of the 360 participants were recruited following \napproaches from the researcher or prison staff. Consequently, it is possible that this \nvolunteer sample did not include segregated or problem prisoners who might not be \ngiven freedom on the wings. However, since participation was voluntary all prisoners \nhad the right to refuse to take part in the study and so research of this kind always runs \nthe risk that the sample will to some extent, be self selecting.  \nSimilarly, it must be borne in mind that forensic populations are likely to include \nindividuals reluctant to divulge information to people whom they may regard as \nauthority figures. Even if prisoners offered candid responses, it still remains that \nperceptions will be subject to memory lapses or inattention on the part of the \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 21 \nrespondent. Consequently, it is feasible that even the most sincere responses will be \ncoloured by cognitive processes that are difficult to overcome. \n Nevertheless, the current study was designed bearing many of these \nissues in mind. Interviews with prisoners were conducted in private and participants \nwere assured, with the exceptions stated before the interview, of confidentiality and \nanonymity consistent with the ethical demands of psychological research. Under these \nconditions, it seemed that prisoners spoke unreservedly about their observations. The \nresults do not indicate, as American researchers (e.g. Camp & Camp 1985; Fong 1990) \nhave suggested, that interviewing prisoners is not a useful method for examining prison \ngang activities. Given the inherently difficult nature of research in a prison setting, \nprisoner reports certainly seem to offer one of the most effective ways of developing an \nunderstanding of prison populations.  \n Future work could continue to address the issue of gang related activity in prison \nby examining prisoners\u201f personal involvement in gang related activity. Certainly, there \nwould be more ethical problems and methodological limitations to asking prisoners \nabout personal involvement. The use of self report may mean that some will \u201efake good\u201f \nrather than admit involvement in criminal activity while in prison. Similarly, there are \nlikely to be ethical problems arising from the information that prisoners disclose. These \nproblems can be reduced if prisoners are fully informed of the kind of information that \ncannot remain confidential. However, any study that has ethical exceptions is likely to \nalso have constrained results. On the other hand, the current study shows that prisoners \ncan offer valuable insight and if we are to further knowledge in this area, prisoners are a \nuseful source of information to understand more about the formation and function of \nprisoners\u201f groups. Indeed, not all groups will be involved in gang related activity so we \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 22 \nneed to understand the purposes of different groups before we can devise policies and \ninterventions, if necessary.  \nThis study reveals that prisoners perceive events associated with gang-related \nactivity are wide-spread in England and Wales. These findings echo claims that prison \nstaff perceive high levels of gang related events (Wood & Adler, 2001). Importantly, \nboth studies reveal that increased levels of gang related events relate strongly to beliefs \nthat prisoners control events in the prison and staff may be unable to maintain order. \nCertainly, some of the activities prisoners reported e.g. drug trafficking necessitate some \ndegree of prisoner autonomy, whereas others, such as assaults on staff, are consistent \nwith a less than ideal level of staff control. As mentioned earlier it is possible that the \nhigher levels of staff per prisoner in U.K. compared to the U.S.A. may impede the \ndevelopment of gang activity in English and Welsh prisons. Indeed, if staff and \nprisoners are to have confidence that staff are able to maintain order in the prison then it \nwould make sense to increase staff levels.  \nNevertheless the paucity of research into prison gangs in the U.K. prevents the \ncurrent findings from being placed in context and so it remains unclear whether gang \nrelated activity in prisons is a recent development or if similar levels have existed across \ntime. The implications from the current findings are that where levels of gang related \nevents are already high they are likely to become even higher as prisoners form groups \nin response to existing groups (Knox, 1994). Indeed, this study\u201fs findings that secret \nracial groupings and prisoner membership of white supremacist groups suggests that \ncounter groups may already be in existence. The implication here is that such a situation \nis likely to worsen rather than lessen and that prisons may become increasingly \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 23 \nvulnerable to prison gang development, gang related activity and a reduction in order \nand control.  \n \n \nEnglish Prison Gangs \n 24 \nReferences \nAdler, J., (1994), Fear in Prisons: A Discussion Paper, London: Prison Reform Trust. \n \nBeaird, L.
