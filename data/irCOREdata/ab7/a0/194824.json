Utilizing evolutionary models for\nJovian planets, we show that infrared imaging with 8-m class telescopes of suitable nearby\nwhite dwarfs should allow us to resolve and detect companions *3MJUP. Detection of\nmassive planetary companions to nearby white dwarfs would prove that such objects can\nsurvive the final stages of stellar evolution, place constraints on the frequency of main-\nsequence stars with planetary systems dynamically similar to our own and allow direct\nspectroscopic investigation of their composition and structure.\nKey words: planetary systems \u2013 white dwarfs.\n1 I N T R O D U C T I O N\nOver 70 extra-solar planets have now been detected since the\ndiscovery of a companion to the solar-type star 51 Peg in 1995\n(Mayor & Queloz 1995). All of these planets have been discovered\nvia the radial velocity technique, in which the presence of a planet\nis inferred by the motion of the central star around the barycentre of\nthe system. Instrumental and intrinsic noise limit the sensitivity of\nthese studies to Saturn-mass companions in short-period orbits,\nwith more massive companions detectable in more distant orbits.\nThe duration of current programmes limits this to ,3.5 au (Fischer\net al. 2002), although some systems do display interesting trends\nindicative of more distant companions. Therefore, we have little\ninformation on systems with massive companions at large radii,\nsuch as our own Solar system. The only constraint on Jovian-like\nsystems comes from micro-lensing statistics, which suggest less\nthan 1\/3 of M stars have Jupiter-mass planets orbiting at 1:5\u20134 au\n(Gaudi et al. 2002).\nThe planets discovered by the radial velocity technique are not\nopen to further direct study, owing to their close proximity to the\nmuch brighter parent star. The only exception to this is the transit-\ning companion to HD 209458 \u0085Porb < 3:5 d\u0086. Transit photometry\nshows this planet is a gas giant, and Charbonneau et al. (2002) have\nrecently detected sodium in its atmosphere. Still, the planet itself\ncannot be directly imaged.\nSeveral groups have conducted imaging surveys of nearby main-\nsequence stars to search for low-mass companions, including the\nuse of adaptive optics, coronographs and space-based observations\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope (e.g. Turner et al. 2001;\nNeuha\u00a8user et al. 2001; Oppenheimer et al. 2001; Kuchner & Brown\n2000; Schroeder et al. 2000). However, the extreme contrast\n($20 mag) and small separations \u00855 au \u0088 1 arcsec at 5 pc) between\nmain-sequence stars and Jovian planets makes sensitive surveys\nvery difficult. To date, no planetary mass companions to nearby\nstars have been imaged, although several brown dwarf companions\nhave been detected via direct imaging (e.g. Nakajima et al. 1995).\nThe end state of main-sequence stars with M # 8 M(, white\ndwarfs, are typically 103 \u2013104 times less luminous than their\nprogenitors. Thus, there is potentially a strong gain in the\nbrightness contrast between a planet and a white dwarf when\ncompared to a main-sequence star, assuming that planets can\nsurvive the late stages of stellar evolution. The gain in contrast is\nstrongest in the mid-infrared, where the thermal emission of the\nplanet peaks well into the Rayleigh\u2013Jeans tail of the white dwarf.\nIndeed, Ignace (2001) has suggested that excess infrared\nemission could be detectable from a hot Jupiter orbiting a 10 000 K\nwhite dwarf at a distance of ,103 white dwarf radii and with an\norbital period of ,10 d. Chu et al. (2001) have also suggested that,\nnear a hot UV-bright white dwarf, the atmosphere of a Jovian\nplanet would be photoionized and emit variable hydrogen\nrecombination lines, which may be detected by high-dispersion\nspectroscopic observations. However, both these methods rely on\nthe planet being in a close \u00850:01\u20132 au\u0086 proximity to the white\ndwarf, where it would be difficult to resolve.\nIn this letter, we discuss the potential for imaging planetary com-\npanions in wide (.5 au) orbits around nearby white dwarfs. In\nSection 2 we investigate the probability of a planetary system\nsurviving the late stages of stellar evolution. We discuss the\ndetectability of any surviving planets in Section 3, suggest suitable\ntarget white dwarfs in Section 4, and discuss the expected frequency\nof wide planetary companions to white dwarfs in Section 5.\nPE-mail: mbu@star.le.ac.uk (MRB); fclarke@ast.cam.ac.uk (FJC); sth@\nast.cam.ac.uk (STH)\nMon.

During these stages, the white dwarf progenitor\nswells up to a few hundred solar radii in size and undergoes\nsignificant mass loss. What happens to a planet during this time\ndepends on the initial orbital separation, the stellar mass-loss rate,\nthe total mass lost, tidal forces and interaction with the ejected\nmaterial.\nAny planet in an initial orbit within the final extent of the red\ngiant\u2019s envelope will be engulfed and migrate inwards. Livio &\nSoker (1984) showed that these planets will either completely\nevaporate or accrete mass and become a close companion to the\neventual white dwarf.\nPlanets in wider orbits that avoid direct contact with the\nexpanding red giant envelope (such as the Jovian planets of our own\nsolar system) will have a greater chance of survival, migrating\noutward as mass is lost from the central star. However, stars more\nmassive than the Sun lose more than half of their original mass in\nevolving to the white dwarf stage (Weidemann 1987; Wood 1992). If\nover half the mass of the central star is lost instantaneously then any\naccompanying planets will likely escape, since their orbital velocity\nwill suddenly exceed the escape velocity of the system. Thus, we\nmight naively expect no white dwarfs to retain planetary systems.\nOf course, in reality, main-sequence stars of M # 8:0 M( do not\nevolve into white dwarfs instantaneously. Mass loss on the RGB\nand AGB, and final ejection of the planetary nebula is a relatively\nslow process. The Sun, for example, will lose around 0.2 M( on the\nRGB in ,106 yr, and up to another 0.2 M( on the AGB on a time-\nscale of up to ,105 yr. The final thermal pulse, in which the cool\nred giant develops a super-wind and finally ejects the remainder of\nits envelope, exposing the core, is poorly understood but probably\noccurs on a time-scale of a few \u00a3 104 yr (Soker 1994).\nThe dynamical time-scale for a planet to react to the change in\nthe mass of the central star, and thus the gravitational force\nbetween the star and planet, is given by\ntdyn .\na\nvorb\n; \u00851\u0086\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the orbit and vorb is the orbital\nvelocity, and\nvorb \u0088\n\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\u0081\nG\u0085M1 \u0087M2\u0086\na\nr\n; \u00852\u0086\nwhere M1 is the mass of the central star and M2 is the mass of the\nplanet. Assuming M1 @ M2\ntdyn . 14 yr\na\n20 au\n\u0010 \u00113=2 M1\nM(\n\u0012 \u001321=2\n: \u00853\u0086\nThis is much less than the mass-loss time-scales mentioned\nabove. Even if a 2-M( star lost its entire envelope (1.4 M() during\na short PN phase of 103 yr (which it does not, only the last few\ntenths of a solar mass), the orbit would not become unbound. Thus,\nto a first approximation, the orbits of planets which do not interact\ndirectly with the red giant will simply expand adiabatically by a\nmaximum factor MMS\/MWD (Jeans 1924; Zuckerman & Becklin\n1987). For example, for a main-sequence star ,2 M( and a white\ndwarf ,0.6 M(, the orbit would expand by a maximum factor ,3.\nA planet in a Jupiter-like orbit would be relocated to ,15 au, and a\nplanet in a Neptune-like orbit to ,90 au.\nFor planets in orbits #10 au, tidal forces between the planet and\nred giant are important in slowing orbital migration by transferring\nangular momentum from the orbit to stellar rotation. For example,\nSoker (1994) shows that, neglecting tidal forces, as the Sun evolves\nto a white dwarf Jupiter\u2019s orbital radius will expand from its\npresent value of a \u0088 1118 R( to a \u0088 1860 R(. However, tidal\nforces on the RGB will counteract this expansion, reducing this\nfinal orbital radius by ,3 per cent, and by a further ,14 per cent\non the upper AGB. For planets within 5 au, Livio & Soker (1983)\nshowed that tidal interactions will actually cause them to migrate\ninwards. Soker (1996) suggests that tidal interactions between\nevolving red giants and low-mass companions could be responsible\nfor producing the large fraction of elliptical PN observed, indicating\nlow-mass companions may be common among PN progenitors.\nThe orbits of distant planets will also be subjected to drag\nresulting from their interaction with the material ejected by the\ncentral star. Duncan & Lissauer (1998) define the total amount of\nmaterial impacting a planet during post-main-sequence evolution as\nMhit\u0085M(\u0086 \u0088\nR2p\n12a 2\n1 2\nMWD\nM(\n\u0012 \u00133\" #\n\u00a3 v\n2\nsw \u0087 v2orb\nv2sw\n\u0012 \u00131=2\n1\u0087 v\n2\nesc\nv2sw \u0087 v2orb\n\u0012 \u0013\n;\nwhere vsw, vorb and vesc are the velocities of the stellar wind, the\nplanet and the escape velocity of the planet respectively, and Rp is\nthe radius of the planet\u2019s magnetosphere. Evaluation of this equation,\nhowever, shows that gas giants will collide with significantly less\nthan 1 per cent of their own mass over the entire red giant phase. The\norbits will decay inwards only slightly as a result.\nDuncan & Lissauer (1998) have made detailed simulations of\nthe effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on the stability of the\nSolar system and for planetary systems around more massive stars.\nThey show that the orbits of the giant planets will probably be\nstable for tens of billions of years subsequent to the Sun\u2019s death.\nHowever, planetary systems dynamically similar to our own around\nsomewhat more massive stars may eventually be de-stabilized.\nDuncan & Lissauer\u2019s calculations show that giant planets around, for\ninstance, an initially 4-M( star, will be liberated by large-scale\nchaos in less than a Hubble time.\nFinally, Soker (1999) points out that the newborn planetary\nnebula central star is hot \u0085Teff * 100 000 K\u0086 and a strong source of\nionizing soft X-ray and UV radiation. The interaction of this\nradiation with a planet may lead to ablation of the planetary\natmosphere, but this will only be effective for planets having an\nescape velocity vesc & cs, where cs \u0088 15 km s21 is the sound speed\nof the ionized planetary material. For a Jupiter-mass planet vesc \u0088\n61 km s21 and thus there will be negligible ablation.\nIt seems likely, then, that giant planets in initially distant \u0085a .\n5 au\u0086 orbits around main-sequence stars 1\u20138 M( will survive the\nlate stages of stellar evolution, and remain in orbit around the\nremnant white dwarfs at increased orbital radii for at least several\nbillion years.\n3 D E T E C T I N G P L A N E T S A R O U N D N E A R B Y\nW H I T E DWA R F S\nOur ability to detect an extra-solar planet around a nearby white\ndwarf will depend on its intrinsic luminosity, which in turn depends\non its age, its distance from us, and its separation from the parent\nstar.\nL42 M.

(1997) have made non-grey calculations of the\nexpected spectra, colours and evolution of solar-metallicity\nmassive planets. We have used these models to predict the infrared\nmagnitudes of planets around nearby white dwarfs. The Burrows\net al. models describe the evolution of a planet in isolation and do\nnot include the effects of thermal insolation by, or reflected light\nfrom, a parent star. In reality, gas\u2013giant planets will have been kept\nwarm throughout their lives by the white dwarf progenitors. They\nwill also have accreted matter during the RGB\/AGB\/PN phases.\nBoth effects would act to increase their temperatures and\nluminosities, although in the white dwarf phase reflected light\nmakes a negligible contribution to the brightness of the planet. Our\npredicted luminosities are, therefore, lower limits.\n3.2 The ages of white dwarfs\nThe white dwarf cooling age and progenitor main sequence\nlifetime are the dominant time-scales determining the brightness of\nany planetary companions, as they are significantly longer than the\nRGB or pre-main-sequence phases.\nWhite dwarf cooling ages are dependent on a number of\nparameters including: effective temperature, mass (usually derived\nfrom the surface gravity), composition of the core and the thickness\nof the surface H- (or He-) dominated atmosphere. Temperature,\nsurface gravity and atmospheric composition are usually\ndetermined through fitting model atmospheres to optical and UV\nspectra (e.g. Bergeron, Saffer & Liebert 1992; Marsh et al. 1997;\nFinley, Koester & Basri 1997). The mass is then inferred from the\nsurface gravity measurement using evolutionary models (e.g.\nWood 1992, 1995). These same models also give the cooling age.\nThe cooling ages and masses of many nearby white dwarfs have\nbeen calculated in this manner by Bergeron, Leggett & Ruiz (2001,\nBLR). For nearby white dwarfs not included in the BLR sample\n(generally, those hotter than ,10 000 K), we have estimated\ncooling ages from published temperature and mass measurements.\nThe relationship between the mass of a white dwarf and its main-\nsequence progenitor, the initial\u2013final mass relation, has been\ninvestigated by a variety of authors. We have adopted model A\nfrom Wood (1992)\nMMS \u0088 10:4 ln \u0085MWD\/M(\u0086\n0:49\n\u0014 \u0015\nM(: \u00854\u0086\nWood (1992) also gives a simple formula for estimating\nmain-sequence lifetimes\ntMS \u0088 10 MMS\nM(\n\u0012 \u001322:5\nGyr: \u00855\u0086\nThe white dwarf cooling age and the main-sequence lifetime can\nthen be combined to give the system age of local white dwarfs. We\nuse this age, combined with the distance to the white dwarf, to\nestimate the magnitude of planets.\n4 S U I TA B L E TA R G E T S A M O N G N E A R B Y\nW H I T E DWA R F S\nThere are 118 white dwarfs currently catalogued within 20 pc of\nthe Sun (Holberg, Oswalt & Sion 2002). All of these systems are\nclose enough to allow us to resolve planetary companions in ,5\u2013\n100 au orbits from the ground. For example, at 10 pc an orbit of\n10 au is equivalent to a maximum separation of 1 arcsec on the sky.\nPlanets in wider orbits will be even easier to resolve. Adaptive\noptics, coronographs and techniques such as nulling interferometry\nwill increase the chances of resolving closer companions.\nHowever, only those white dwarfs young enough for Jovian\ncompanions to still be detectable will make suitable targets for\nextra-solar planet searches. We are most likely to be able to detect\nan extra-solar planet around a relatively warm and young (,a\nFigure 1. The relationship between white dwarf mass and main-sequence\nlifetime (from equations 4 and 5). The steepness of the relationship in the\nrange 0:55 , MWD , 0:6 shows why we should not rule out white dwarfs\nwith mass estimates in this range, despite the indications their progenitors\nhad a long main-sequence lifetime.\nTable 1.

For MWD , 0:6 M(, the main-\nsequence lifetime is very sensitive to errors in the MWD estimate\n(see Fig. 1). Therefore, we would be unwise to rule out white\ndwarfs with mass estimates below 0.6 M(, as they may be\ndescended from more massive stars than we expect.\nTable 1 lists the top 10 candidates among nearby white dwarfs\nfor a search for planetary companions, considering the main-\nsequence lifetime tMS, the white dwarf cooling age tCOOL and the\ndistance. Also included in the table are the estimated J-band\nmagnitude of 3, 5 and 10MJUP planets in each system.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the magnitude of a 5MJUP planet around these\nwhite dwarfs in several near-IR bands (J, H, K, L0 and M). Also\nplotted are the nominal sensitivity limits for current near-infrared\nimaging instruments (from on-line exposure time estimates);\nGemini-North \u0087 NIRI (solid lines) and VLT \u0087 ISAAC (dashed\nlines). We can see that although the planets are brighter in the M\nband (5mm), the instruments are only sensitive enough in the J and\nH bands (1.1 and 1.6mm).\n5 T H E E X P E C T E D F R E Q U E N C Y O F P L A N E T S\nI N W I D E O R B I T S A R O U N D W H I T E DWA R F S\nAssuming that massive planets born in initially wide (*5 au) orbits\nremain bound to white dwarfs, then the expected frequency of\nmassive planets around nearby white dwarfs is simply a function of\nthe frequency of solar-like and more massive main-sequence stars\nwith Jovian-like planetary systems. Unfortunately, we currently\nhave little observational information on these systems, although it\nis possible to extrapolate from existing data to make some estimate\nof what we might expect. Lineweaver & Grether (2002, LG) have\nanalysed the statistics of planets detected via radial velocity\ntechniques, and estimated the number of Jovian-like systems we\nmight expect to find. They have produced a fit to the completeness-\ncorrect period distribution of planets so far detected, in the mass\nrange 0:84MJUP , M sin i , 13MJUP\ndN\nd log P\n\u0088 a log P\u0087 b; \u00856\u0086\nwhere a \u0088 12 ^ 3 and b \u0088 29 ^ 2. The initial orbital periods of\ninterest range from ,10 yr, to avoid direct interaction with the\nexpanding red giant envelope, to ,200 yr, where we might expect\nJovian planet formation to end. Integrating equation (6) over this\nrange, we estimate there to be ,55 ^ 16 Jovian planets per\n,1000 white dwarf systems. However, for a significant sample of\nnearby white dwarfs we can only detect planets *5MJUP with\ncurrent technology. LG fit the observed planetary mass function as\ndN\nd log\u0085M sin i\u0086 \u0088 a log\u0085M sin i\u0086 \u0087 b; \u00857\u0086\nwhere a \u0088 224 ^ 4. To produce 55 ^ 16 planets over the mass\nrange 0:84MJUP , M sin i , 13MJUP we need to set b \u0088 258:4 ^\n19:7: Therefore, from equation (7), we expect ,15 ^ 6 planets\n*5MJUP per 1000 white dwarfs. Hence, we may expect ,1\u20132 per\ncent of white dwarfs to possess one or more planets *5MJUP. Note\nthat we treat M sin i as equivalent to M, so this predicted number\ndensity is a lower limit.\nThis analysis is, however, based on statistics for planets in orbits\n#3.5 au. It is quite possible that laws derived for planets in this\narea of orbital parameter space around ,1 M( stars do not apply to\nJovian planets at large radii (.5 au) around more massive stars\n\u00852\u20138 M(\u0086.\n6 D I S C U S S I O N\nWe have suggested that Jovian planets will survive the late stages\nof stellar evolution, and that some nearby white dwarfs possess\nplanetary systems in wide orbits. Utilizing evolutionary models for\nJovian planets, we have shown that infrared imaging of suitable\nnearby white dwarfs should allow us to resolve and detect\ncompanions M * 3MJUP with 8-m class telescopes. The best\ncandidates for an observational search are relatively hot (young),\nmassive (.0.6 M() white dwarfs, as they have the shortest overall\nsystem age. However, given that we have neglected potential\nheating mechanisms such as thermal insolation and accretion from\nthe red giant\u2019s wind, Jovian planets around nearby white dwarfs are\nlikely to be brighter than we have suggested in Fig. 2, and may be\ndetectable around ,0.55 M( white dwarfs descended from\nprogenitors as low in mass as ,1.2 M(.\nOur \u2018top ten\u2019 list of targets among nearby white dwarfs (Table 1)\nincludes degenerates descended from main-sequence progenitors\nfrom 2:6\u20137:4 M(, corresponding to spectral types early A and\nB. The existence of a dust disc around Vega (A0V) strongly\nsuggests that planetary systems may exist around such early-type\nstars, although they are not the subject of current radial velocity\nsearches.\nDetection of massive planetary companions to nearby white\ndwarfs would prove that such objects can survive the final stages of\nstellar evolution, place constraints on the frequency of main-\nsequence stars with planetary systems dynamically similar to our\nown, and allow direct spectroscopic investigation of their\ncomposition and structure.\nAn unsuccessful search would suggest one of, or a combination\nof, a number of scenarios, including: (a) that planets *3MJUP are\nfainter than expected from the evolutionary models we have used;\n(b) that, at least for a sub-sample of targets, any accompanying\nplanets have too small a projected separation from the white dwarf\nto be resolved; (c) that massive Jupiters in wide orbits around\n1\u20138 M( main-sequence stars are not common; (d) that these\nplanets do not remain bound to white dwarfs. This last scenario\nwould raise the possibility that the Galaxy contains a population of\nFigure 2.
