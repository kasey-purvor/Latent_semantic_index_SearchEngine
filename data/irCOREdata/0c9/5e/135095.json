Introduction. \n \nCoating flows are fluid flows which result in thin films of liquid forming onto surfaces.  Such \nflows occur naturally or are engineered for the manufacture of a variety of products such as wall \npaper and adhesive tapes, photographic and X-ray films, magnetic tapes for audio, video and \ncomputer use, electronic circuit boards, printing plates for papers, books and magazines, coated \npapers for printing etc....  With these products, the coated layer on the substrate is the functional  \n \n*Corresponding author. \n \npart, it is made of a liquid- solid or polymeric formulation of specific physical and rheological  \nproperties and it must be of a certain thickness and uniformity to fulfil the application for which \nit is designed.  Also, the speed at which the coated film is required differs depending on \napplications and controls the economics of the operation.  No one coating flow can operate to \nyield the wide range of film thickness - speeds required in practice without exhibiting non \nuniformity (instabilities) on the free surface, entraining air within the film or breaking altogether.  \nIndeed, most coating flows have a narrow stable window of operation, not easily predictable, \nhence the reliance on experience when designing or operating coaters.  Inevitably, difficulties \narise with new applications which require more strict specifications on quality.  Clearly a \nclassification of the coating methods available and their flow analyses is useful in this context.  \nThis is the subject of this paper which draws on work carried out by the authors and other \nresearchers in this important area of fluid mechanics where a-priori the fluids must be regarded \nas non-Newtonian. \n \n2. Classification \n \nLimiting the classification to coating flows leading to the continuous formation and deposition \nof a film onto a surface, we observe that this can be carried out in one or a combination of the \nfollowing broad ways: \n \n (i) withdrawal of liquid from a pool by a moving substrate, i.e. free coating   \n   flow, \n  \n (ii) metering an excess amount of liquid in a flow geometry to form a film onto a \nmoving   substrate, i.e. metered coating flow, \n \n (iii) delivering the exact amount of liquid in a flow geometry to form a film and then  \n  transferring it onto a moving  substrate, i.e. transfer coating flow, \n   \n \n (iv) allowing a moving substrate to wipe a proportion of a coating trapped in the cells of \n  a printed or gravure roller, i.e. print or gravure coating flow. \n \nThese coating flows have been developed with the purpose of:- precision and independence of \nfilm thickness from the physical properties of the liquid and the speed of the substrate and - \nreduction of film thickness to lowest possible values whilst keeping the above requirements on \nprecision and independence from operating conditions.  Types (i) to (iv) coating flows \nprogressively  respond to these needs and are now examined further. \n \n3. Free Coating Flows \n \nThis is a simple flow scheme which results from the withdrawal of liquid from a pool by a \nmoving plane or a rotating cylinder, as illustrated in Fig. 1.  In both cases, all the operating \nvariables play a part in controlling the thickness of the film formed, its stability and air \nentrainment.  Since the rotating roller flow is essentially an inclined plane in curvilinear \ncoordinates, the angular withdrawal case is representative of a general free coating flow.  No \ncomplete solution of such a flow problem is available; approximations of the film thickness, ho, \ndeveloped far upstream are obtained depending on the flow conditions which can be represented \nby the capillary (Ca= \uf06duw\/\uf073) and Reynolds (Re = \uf072 uw ho\/\uf06d) numbers.     \n \nLow Ca and negligible Re \nWhen surface tension effects are important and inertia is negligible, a one dimensional \ndescription of the flow is feasible [1-3] and produces estimates of the film thickness as: \n \n  216\/1 )cos1(944.0*\/ \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d \uf061CahhT oo        (1) \n \nwhich are in agreement with experimental data [1,3]. In the above equation, h u gw* ( \/ )\uf03d \uf06d \uf072\n1 2 is \na characteristic film thickness obtained by balancing viscous and gravity forces.  \n \n \n (b) Intermediate Ca and Re \n \nWhen inertia forces are introduced, the model equations become non linear two dimensional and \nsimplifications become necessary to produce solutions to the problem.  The simplest approach is \nto consider first order inertia terms only as was done by Soroka and Tallmadge [4] and later by \nTharmalingham and Wilkinson [5] to obtain corrections to the above equation. The predictions \nso obtained however are still limited and apply to Ca <1. A more comprehensive inclusion of \ninertia effects was carried out by Esmail and coworkers [6,7] who used the thin film \napproximation in the continuity and Navier-Stokes equations:        \n   \n  ux + vy =  O.            (2) \n    \n  \uf061\uf072\uf06d\uf072 sin)(uu x gupvu yyxy \uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf02b        (3) \n \n       \uf061\uf072\uf06d cosgvpO yyy \uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d        (4) \n \nsubject to the following boundary conditions at the moving wall and the free surface: \n \n  u (x, o) = v (x, o)  =  O          (5) \n \n  OhxhvpOhxu xxyy \uf03d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d ),()2(;),( \uf073\uf06d       (6)  \n  \n \nUsing the direct method of Galerkin, Esmail and Hummel [6] transformed these equations into a \nsingle differential equation which they integrated from the constant film region where h = ho to \nthe static meniscus (xs, hs) where the balances of forces was assumed to be: \n \n   \uf061\uf061\n\uf072\n\uf073\ncos1),()sin\n2\n( 2 \uf02d\uf03d\uf02b ssxxx hxhh\ng\n       (7) \n   \nTypical results of the numerical integration for vertical withdrawal are presented in [6] where the \ndependence of To on Re and Ca is replaced by an equivalent To (\uf067, Ca) with \uf067 = \uf073 ( \uf072\/ \uf06d\n4 g)1\/3 a \nfluid property number which essentially describes the effect of Re since \uf067 \uf0ba  (Re\/Ca)2\/3.  Thus at \nfixed \uf067, large Ca leads to high Re whereas at fixed Ca, large \uf067 correponds to high Re.  A \nbranching of the curves To (\uf067, Ca) is observed as Ca and \uf067 are increased showing the limiting \neffect of inertia on the thickness of the films formed. The more viscous flow (Re ~ 0) exhibits a \nlarge constant To(~ 0.8), the rapid flow (Re > 10) exhibits a smaller constant To (~ 0.5).  A good \nagreement with experimental data is observed for a wide range of Ca (up to 50) and Re (up to \n10).  This theory gives a significant improvement to predictions obtained with eqn. (1). Another \nimportant observation is that the effect of the angle, \uf061 on film thickness is not simply correcting \nfor the effect of gravity on bulk flow.  As this angle varies, the shape of the coating meniscus \nvaries greatly and this must have an effect on the film thickness  [6,7].  This theory however \ndoes not provide a limit to coating flow which is observed at high Reynolds numbers. \n \n(c) Large Re free coating   \nCerro and Scriven [8] have examined this limiting flow behaviour using a rapid flow analysis \nbased on an integral momentum balance written across the film thickness from 0 to h as: \n \n  ghohudyu\nxd\nd h\no y\n\uf072\uf06d\uf06d\uf072 \uf02d  \uf03d\uf0f2 )(u)( y\n2\n       (8) \n    \nwith parabolic velocity distributions upstream in the static meniscus region and downstream \nwhere the film thickness levels to a constant value.  Solving the resulting equations as an initial \nvalue problem, they obtain a limit for vertical withdrawal as: \n \n  To = 0.5439           (9) \n          \nCampanella and Cerro [9] extended this analysis to angular (roll) withdrawal and established \nbounds for To as: \n \n   \n   \n  o9035        \n)(sin\n0.5439\n<T<\n)(sin\n4714.0 o\no \uf03c\uf03c\uf061\n\uf061\uf061 2121\n     (10)  \n    \n      o90 >\n)(sin\n5439.0\n\uf061\n\uf061 21\n\uf03coT       (11)  \n    \nThese criteria fit in with the experimental data of Tharmalingham and Wilkinson [5] and \nGutfinger and Tallmadge [10].  All the theories developed above can be extended to purely non-\nNewtonian viscous behaviour [11-15].  Although much progress has been made in the analysis \nof free coating, there still is a need for a unified theory capable of predicting film thickness for \nthe entire range of stable operating conditions.  Computer based solutions using finite element \nmethods are now feasible. \n \n4. Metered Coating Flows \n \nHere a boundary is put in place to reduce the extent of flow as shown in Fig. 2a,b,c.  Clearly for \na given substrate speed and fluid we can reduce the thickness of the emerging film by reducing \nthe gap between the boundary and the moving substrate but also by allowing the boundary to \nmove in opposite direction to the substrate.  We have now arrived at reverse roll coating (Fig.2b) \nwhere the moving boundary in the shape of a roller is convenient.  We may also drive the \nmoving boundary in the same direction as the substrate thus splitting the emerging flow into two \nfilms as in forward roll coating depicted in Fig.2c.  No other means are available to reduce the \nfilm thickness further except that a vacuum may be applied upstream of the boundary or across it \nif it were porous to reduce the pressure flow contribution. All these geometries show a feed \nregion upstream of the flow and a film(s) formation region downstream.  Upstream where the \nregions are narrow, a lubrication flow may be assumed and \n \n  \uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n)(2)(\n12 21\n2 xh\nquu\nxh\npx\n\uf06d\n        (12)  \n      \n expresses the variation of the pressure gradient, in the direction, x, of flow with gap, h, between \nthe boundaries and volumetric flow rate, q, across; u1 and u2 are the velocities of the stationary \nor moving walls.  In blade type metered flow u2 would be zero; in reverse roll coating u2 would \nassume a negative value.  A general expression for q is: \n \n   q  =  u1 h1 + u2 h2         (13) \n        \nPressure conditions at the points limiting the feed region are necessary to solve the above \nequations. The problem is that these positions xi and xe and the pressures at them, are not known \nand further approximations have to be made to obtain an analytical solution.  Two scenarios \narise:  \n \n(i) When the coating flow lends itself to plausible conditions, such as in blade coating (Fig. 2a) \nwhere the flow length is known, we may assume the whole region underneath the blade to be \ngoverned by the above equation and that pressures at the extremities are zero.  Such a model, \nused by Middleman [16], gives a dimensionless film thickness which is function of the geometry \nof the system only and is compatible with experiment data.  A solution which accounts for the \neffect of speed, viscosity and surface tension can be sought by allowing the pressure downstream \nto be set by the coating meniscus formed, i.e. \n \n  p  (xe)   =  - \uf073\/rc           (14) \n         \nwith the radius of curvature, rc, related to the dimensions at exit of the flow.  For blade coating, \nit would approximate to: \n \n  rc = h (xe) - h1           (15) \n          \nand a solution to eqn. (12) can be expressed as: \n \n   \n   \n  \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf02d \uf0f2 \uf0f2\ne\ni\ne\ni\nx\nx\nx\nx\ne\ndx\nxh\nhu\ndx\nxh\nu\nhxh )()(2\n12\n)( 3\n11\n2\n1\n1\n\uf06d\n\uf073\n     (16) \n    \nh1 the film thickness formed, being the only unknown.   \n \n(ii) When the flow geometry does not help to approximate xi and xe, p (xi) and p (xe) as in two- \nroll coating operations where the separation meniscus does not detach from the solid boundary, \nsolutions are sought by assuming first that the feed region extends far upstream (xi  \uf0ae  - \uf0a5) and \nthat p (xi) is known.  Also, the pressure downstream p (xe) can be assumed to be nil or  =  - \uf073\/rc \n(with an appropriate rc) as was done for blade coating above.  In forward roll coating for \nexample, Fig. 2c,  the radius of curvature can be approximated by: \n \n  rc  =  \u00bd ( h (xe) - h1 - h2)         (17) \n        \nand a solution to eqn. (12) is: \n \n  \n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02d \uf0f2 \uf0f2\ne\ni\ne\ni\nx\nx\nx\nx\ne xh\nhuhu\nxh\ndxuu\nhhxh )()(2\n12\n)(\n2\n3\n2211\n2\n21\n21\n\uf06d\n\uf073\n   (18)   \nwhere h1, h2 and xe are all unknown.  More equations are needed to locate xe and these are given \nby assuming that at xe, the velocity is zero and the flow splits such as du\/dy (xe) = 0 (Prandtl-\nHopkins separation conditions  [17]).  Many analyses of metered coating flows have been carried \nout along these lines.  For forward roll coating, a dimensionless total flow rate, \uf06c = (u1h1 + u2 \nh2)\/\n1 2  ho (u1+u2), of about 1.30 and a flux distribution, h1\/ h2 = (u1\/u2)\n0.5 are predicted and \ndescribe the trend of the experimental data (Benkreira, Wilkinson and Edwards [18] ).  For \nreverse roll coating, the above analytical treatment yields a dimensionless flow rate, \uf06c = u2 h2\/ho \n(u2 - u1) of about 0.65 consistent with experimental data at low speed ratio u1\/u2 (Benkreira, \nWilkinson and Edwards [19] ). \n \n \nInspite of the fair agreement with experimental data the whole approach described above is \nflawed; it ignores the regions either side of the feed region, particularly downstream where the \nfilm is actually forming and where the lubrication approximation is not valid as explained by \nTaylor  [20] and Pearson [21].  In principle, the film formation region which extends from xe to \nxs (the real separation point) should be analysed assuming a full 2D free surface flow analysis \nand matched at xe with the lubrication portion of the flow.  Pitts and Greiller [22] initiated this \napproach and produced an approximate solution of the biharmonic equation, for the symmetrical \nforward roll coating using the full traction boundary conditions on the free surface which they \napproximated to a parabola.  Pitts and Greiller's predictions for the position of the separation \npoint where in satisfactory agreement with their experimental data.  This procedure was also \nused by Williamson [23] who solved the biharmonic equation numerically when the separation \ninterface is expressed by a polynominal in the symmetrical forward roll coating.  Further \ndevelopments have been made with the advent of fast computers and efficient numerical \nalgorithms as indicated by the work of Coyle, Macosko and Scriven [24].  Closer agreement with \nexperimental data has been achieved by this approach which reproduces for example the film \nsplit ratio h1\/h2 = (u1\/u2)\n0.65 measured by Benkreira et al.[19].  More importantly, such an \napproach is essential for stability analyses which rely on accurately predicted free surface \nposition and profile [25]. \n \n5. Transfer Coating Flows \n \nIn this system, a uniform film flow per unit width, q, is transferred onto a moving substrate.  At \nany substrate velocity, uw, the film thickness on the substrate, hw ( = q\/uw), can be controlled to \nany desired value by varying q.  This operating scheme is attractive since it removes the \ndependency of film thickness on operating variables, the substrate speed in particular.  However, \nit relies on a uniform and controlled film flow, q, being provided.  Coating flows which fall in \nthis category originate from slots or extrusion dies, curtains or slides and single and multiple \nrolls coaters.  In all cases, the range of q and uw which can be achieved must be limited by the \nonset of free surface instabilities and\/or air entrainment on the final film.  The design of the \ninterfacing unit between the film flow supplied and the final film formed controls the operating \nrange.  It is this interfacing unit which we refer to as a transfer coating flow unit, examples of \nwhich we now examine. \n \n(a) roller based transfer coating \n \nHere the uniform film flow orginates from a roll coating operation and is controlled by a free \ncoating flow (single roll) or a metering coating flow (pair of rollers as in forward or reverse roll \ncoating).  The transfer flow is carried out in a \"kiss\" contact mode to ensure almost complete \ntransfer (Fig. 3a).  The tension applied on the substrate and the wrap angle are additional \nparameter and they, together with the operating variables controlling, q, must fix the range of the \nstable film thicknesses which can be formed.  No work in this area has been reported and it is \npresumed in practice that if the film flow q is stable, the final film also will be stable and free \nfrom air. \n \n(b) slide coating \n \nHere a uniform film flows over an inclined surface prior to meeting a moving substrate (Fig. 3b).  \nBecause the film flow is entrained, two coating meniscus are formed, one of them connecting \ntwo contact (solid-liquid-air) lines.  The resulting coating bead controls stability and air \nentrainment and is clearly very difficult to predict in terms of the flow within it.  Vacuum \npressure can be used as an external controlling variable to pin the lower meniscus and retard the \nonset of air entrainment. Also known as bead coating, this transfer coating flow forms a \ncontinuous film only when the speed of the moving substrate lies within a certain range [ uw,min, \nuw,max].  The experimental work of Tallmadge, Weinberger and Faust [26] defines the upper \nspeed limit uw,max as that at which the amount of fluid bridging the gap between the slide and \nthe substrate is not sufficient to maintain a bead and a uniform film.  In practice, this manifests \nitself with a thin bead and a film which splits into two streams at uw,max.  More streams appear \nwhen the uw > uw,max and air is sucked in.  At the lower limit, the film narrows, the liquid is \nunable to bridge the gap and at the limit, uw,min it drips off the slide without touching the web.  \nClearly, the volumetric  \n flow rate of liquid feeding the transfer flow must control these limits; the gap, the angle between \nthe slide and the web, the vacuum applied and the physical properties of the fluid may also have \nan effect.  The experiments of Tallmadge et al [26] show that the flow rate has  a primary \ninfluence and gap the least effect.  Their data can be expressed as: \n \n  uw,max  \uf061   q\n0.8  \uf06d0.3 ho\n0.15         (19) \n \nGuttoff and Kendrick [27] observed that compared with atmospheric operation, a small vacuum \nincreased the limit of coatability and allowed the production of thinner films.  Higher vacuums it \nmust be noted gave little further decrease in film thickness. Also observed by Guttoff and \nKendrick is that the maximum velocities with no bead vacuum are identical to the plunging tape \nair entrainment velocities [28,29] and that polymeric solutions showed wider limits of coatability \nbecause of their larger elongational viscosities. \n \n(c) slot coating \n \nHere the film flow q is delivered by a slot (Fig. 3c.) and then transferred onto a moving \nsubstrate.  The coating bead which forms has two meniscii both attached to the slot edges unlike \nslide coating where the upper meniscus is \"free\".  Lee and Liu [30] developed the similarity with \nslide coating and showed that below a critical capillary number Cac, both flows behave similarly.  \nAbove Cac, they observed that the same thickness can be coated at much higher speed so that \nuw,max is much higher than for slide coating.  Their data indicate that above Cac, slot coating \nproduces film with minimum thickness about 60 to 70% of the gap size independently of web \nspeed and liquid properties.  \n \n(d) die coating \n \nIn order to widen the limit of coatability, a die instead of a slot can be used.  In such a design \n(Fig. 3d.), the liquid is given greater contact with the web and both the geometry of the die and a \nvacuum upstream can be manipulated to control flow in the bead and increase uw,max. \n6. Gravure or Print Coating Flows \n \nThe operation uses a roller with a pattern which is either chemically or mechanically engraved \non it.  Typical patterns are the quadrangular, trihelical and pyramidal with cell volume per unit \narea of about 10-50x10-6 m3\/m2 and a wetted area coverage of 0.80-0.90 m2\/m2 of  roller \nsurface.  These cells are flooded with liquid and wiped by a blade pressed against the rotating \nroller.  The ensuing liquid is then transferred directly onto the substrate (direct gravure) as \nillustrated in Fig. 4 or onto a transfer roll which applies the coating to the substrate (indirect or \noffset gravure coating). The applied blade load and the hydrodynamic pressure generated by the \nliquid underneath the blade control the thickness of the film formed over the filled gravure cells.  \nClearly, gravure coating flow describes the situation where these  loads are such that the blade \nwipes clean the periphery of the roller leaving only the gravure cells filled with liquid.  Benkreira \nand Patel [31] described the loading conditions required for gravure coating; their data show that \nhigher volume factor are helpful but that true gravure coating is not easily achieved. The transfer \nof the liquid from the cells to the moving substrate was also studied experimentally by Benkreira \nand Patel [32] and their findings suggests that about 1\/3 of the cell volume is transferred as a \nfilm at large speeds regardless of speed ratios (between the moving web and gravure roller).  At \nlow speeds, there appears to be a maximum in the film thickness curves for the trihelical and \npyramidal cell configurations suggesting that larger films are formed  i.e. these cells empty better \nat low speeds.  The reverse is observed with the quadrangular geometry where a minimum \noccurs at low speeds.  At present no theory is available to explain these findings and further \nwork is required.  Note that in our classification, gravure coating could also fall in the transfer \ncoating flow category since a film is formed as a result of liquid transferring from the cells to the \nsubstrate. \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nThis brief review suggests that coating flows can be classified for the purpose of analysis.  \nCommon features appear throughout but the challenging task is to develop a fundamental model \nfor film formation which can be adapted to all coating flows.  Other features not yet completely \nresolved concern flow instabilities and air entrainment as well as the effect of non-Newtonian \nbehaviour.  With all these aspects, coating flows have now become an important area of research \nin fluid mechanics [33-35]. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe financial assistance of the Science and Enginering Research Council (UK) is gratefully \nacknowledged.
