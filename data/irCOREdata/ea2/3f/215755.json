G, the Court of Appeal awarded a joint residence order to the \nappellant, who was the lesbian ex-partner of the child\u2019s full biological mother.  The \naward also indirectly vested the appellant, a social parent, with parental responsibility \nand extended a body of case-law to same-sex couples, which had until now only been \napplied to heterosexual couples.  In the first part of this note I detail the facts and \nspecific legal issues of the case, elaborating on some derivative issues relating \nespecially to social parents and the parental responsibility framework under the \nChildren Act 1989.  In this context I put forward a defined test of \u2018parental fitness\u2019 \n(which focuses on active \u2018care\u2019 as its central consideration) for social parents who \nmust appeal to the court\u2019s discretion to obtain parental responsibility.  In the second \npart of the note, I discuss the positive aspects of Re. G, but simultaneously offer some \nreservations.  These reservations revolve around a critique of law\u2019s preference for the \n\u2018sexual family\u2019 and I argue that while the legal recognition of \u2018family diversity\u2019 and \nparenthood remains modeled on this \u2018sexual family\u2019, the relaxation of family \n\u2018boundaries\u2019 will remain limited, despite legal victories such as Re. G. \n \n 2 \n  \nKEY WORDS: care, Children Act 1989, family diversity, gender, lesbian \ncohabitating couple separating, parental responsibility, same-sex parent, sexuality, \nshared residence order, social parent \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nIn Re. G,\n1\n the Court of Appeal had to deal for the first time with a case involving a \ndispute over a child of a (lesbian) same-sex couple.\n2\n  Firstly, in granting the appellant, \nMs. W\u2019s request for a joint residence order, so as she could indirectly acquire parental \nresponsibility, the case can be commended for affording recognition to same-sex \nrelationships and parenting.  Secondly, and perhaps less obviously, the Court of \nAppeal\u2019s ruling should be applauded for similarly recognising social parenting and \nactive care-giving from non-biological parents, such as Ms. W.  Thirdly, having \ncommanded unanimous agreement, Lord Justice Thorpe\u2019s leading judgment stands as \na cogent judicial statement in support of the statutory trend towards relaxing the \ntraditional parenthood and family-form boundaries, which legislation like the \nChildren Act 1989 (under which this case was to be decided) has served to entrench.\n3\n  \nHowever, the relaxation of traditional boundaries, especially in the context of the \n                                                 \n1\n Re. G (Children) [2005] E.W.C.A. (Civ) 462, hereinafter Re. G. \n2\n Previous cases such as G v F (shared residence:  parental responsibility) [1998] 3 F.C.R 1, have only \nbeen tried in the lower level courts.  This particular case questioned the correct criteria to be applied to \nan application for leave to apply for a shared residence order in respect of a child, after a lesbian \ncohabiting couple separated.   \n3\n See Thorpe, L.J., Re.G, supra n.1, at para. 7.  While Thorpe L.J. was referring specifically to the \nrelaxation of the original s.4 boundaries of the Children Act, this notion can be given a more general \napplication if we consider new reforming legislation such as the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and \nthe Civil Partnership Act 2004. \n 3 \nvalorisation of the \u2018sexual family\u2019 model4 and non-biological parenthood, is far from \ntotal and \u2018non-standard\u2019 families and parents continue to struggle for recognition.  I \nwant therefore in this note, to firstly review the facts and legal issues raised and to \nelaborate some of the consequential and derivative legal problems which emerge, \nparticularly for social parents.  Secondly, I want to offer some analysis of why the \ncase should be welcomed in the three contexts outlined above, but to simultaneously \nvoice some reservations about the extent to which \u2018family diversity\u2019 really has been \ngiven recognition by the case.  I will argue that while the trend of extending legal \nrecognition to non-standard families remains based on the extent to which they reflect \nthe \u2018sexual family\u2019, traditional \u2018family\u2019 boundaries can never be totally relaxed, \ndespite notable legal victories such as Re. G. \n \n  \nTHE FACTS AND LEGAL ISSUES \n \nThe appellant, Ms. W, and the respondent, Ms. G, were in a relationship from August \n1995, cohabiting until May 2003, whereupon they separated.  During the course of \ntheir relationship, Ms. G and Ms. W had two daughters together, M and M, born 2 \nFebruary 1999 and 26 June 2001.  Ms. G was the full biological mother of both \nchildren, who were conceived through anonymous donor insemination.  While Ms. G \nwas the children\u2019s main carer, Ms. W played a substantial part in their early lives, \nboth in respect to their day-to-day care, and in the formation of their \u2018kinship\u2019 identity.  \nShe was, effectively, their co-mother, or social parent.  This fact was nowhere \ndisputed in the history of the case.  The report of the CAFCASS officer stated, \u201c\u2026the \n                                                 \n4\n See Fineman (1995).  This will be discussed further infra. \n 4 \nimportance and value of Ms. W\u2019s role in their lives needs to be acknowledged\u2026\u201d5, \nwhile Judge Hughes\u2019 reserved written judgment from the trial proceedings of 2004 \ncontained the following in the concluding paragraph: \u201c\u2026.Miss W is a significant \nfigure in their [M and M\u2019s] lives and\u2026.her important place both historically and in \nthe future can be maintained and reinforced by good quality frequent contact.\u201d 6  \nDespite this recognition, the trial judge did not award Ms. W the requested joint \nresidence order for the younger child.  That Ms. W had only to request a joint \nresidence order for the younger child deserves some elaboration.   \n \nFirstly, it should be noted that the law distinguishes between the status of being a \nparent and the power to act as a parent.\n7\n  The former can be further divided into what \nAndrew Bainham has described as legal parentage and legal parenthood.\n8\n  He uses \nparentage to refer to the genetic connection(s), and parenthood to refer to the legal \nparent(s).\n9\n  Whilst often these will be held by the same person(s), adoption and \nassisted reproduction demonstrate the usefulness of his taxonomy, especially if we \nconsider the growing legal emphasis of a child\u2019s \u2018right\u2019 to knowledge about their \norigins and genetic parents.\n10\n  The latter\u2014the power to act as a parent\u2014is gained by \nacquiring \u2018parental responsibility\u2019 under the auspices of the Children Act 1989.  \n                                                 \n5\n Re. G, supra n.1, at para. 9, per Thorpe L.J. \n6\n Ibid, para. 16 \n7\n See Barton and Douglas (1995), pp.49-50. \n8\n See Bainham (1999), pp.25-46. \n9\n Which, it should be noted, he does not limit to two persons (ie. one male, one female).  The historic \nneed for male-female intercourse for reproduction, and the development (especially since Western \nindustrialisation) of what Martha Fineman has described as the privatised, \u2018sexual family\u2019, have \ncoupled to make persistent a model of parentage and parenthood whereby children are entitled to one \nparent of each sex, but no more, and sometimes, less (see the fatherlessness clause in s.28 of the \nHuman Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990).  See Fineman, supra n.4.  This two-parent framework \nwill be critiqued further infra.  \n10\n This trend can be evidenced by the growth of \u2018open adoptions\u2019, and the fact that since April 1st 2005, \ngamete donors must provide identifying information, to which the children, born from their gametes, \nwill be entitled to obtain, upon reaching 18.  Bainham also draws attention to international law, \nespecially Articles 7(1) and 8(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which he \nsuggests acknowledge the child\u2019s fundamental right to establish connections with his or her genetic \nparents.  Bainham, supra n.8, pp.36-39. \n 5 \nWhilst its framework is clearly modeled on the heterosexual two-parent family,\n11\n it \ndoes have the flexibility to recognise a multiplicity of de facto parenting situations.\n12\n  \nAlso, it is not necessary to have legal parentage or parenthood to have parental \nresponsibility.   \n \nThis brings us to the second point of elaboration.  The method for obtaining parental \nresponsibility varies between different categories of \u2018parent\u2019, and especially between \nthose \u2018parents\u2019 whose role and\/or connection is chiefly social, as opposed to those \nwith a genetic and\/or legal parenthood connection.  For example, it is automatic for all \nmothers and fathers married to the child\u2019s mother,13 whilst unmarried (genetic) fathers \nmay acquire it through jointly registering the child\u2019s birth with the mother, 14  or \nthrough a formal parental responsibility agreement with the child\u2019s mother or the \ncourt.\n15\n  Given recent legislative changes, step-parents and civil partners will soon \nsimilarly be entitled to apply directly for parental responsibility through an explicit \nclause in the Act.\n16\n  However, even with these reforms, some categories of \u2018parent\u2019 \nwill remain outside such boundaries.  These parents will include, for example, social \nparents who are not in a legally recognised partnership with a parent who already has \nparental responsibility or an egg donor who is the intended co-parent of a child bore \nby another woman, and conceived using the sperm of the birth mother\u2019s partner.   \n \n                                                 \n11\n See Sheldon (2001). \n12\n For example, s.3(5) permits a person who does not have parental responsibility, but who does have \ncare of the child, to do what is reasonable in the circumstances for the purposes of safeguarding the \nchild\u2019s safety or welfare.  \n13\n S.2.  Note that while the legislation refers to \u2018mothers\u2019, we must qualify this with the term \n\u2018gestational\u2019 as opposed to genetic.   \n14\n S.4(1)(a). \n15\n S.4(1)(b) or (c) respectively. \n16\n S.12 of the Adoption and children Act 2002 will insert a new s.4A into the Children Act which will \nprovide for the acquisition of parental responsibility by a step-parent, while s.75(2) of the Civil \nPartnership Act 2004 will insert into s.4A(1) the words, \u201cor a civil partner of\u201d immediately after the \nwords \u201cis married to\u201d. \n 6 \nThirdly then, parents outside the legislatively prescribed boundaries, have two options \nin seeking to obtain parental responsibility.  These \u2018options\u2019 are more onerous and \nmuch less certain than those for biological parents, or for those adults who are legally \nconnected to an already recognised parent.\n17\n  By virtue of s.10(5)(b) of the Children \nAct, if they have lived with the child \u201cfor a period of at least three years\u201d they are \nentitled to apply for a residence order, as defined in s.8.  If a residence order is \nobtained, parental responsibility, under the terms of s.12(2) is then automatically \ngranted, although with notable prohibitions in relation to agreeing to, or refusing an \nadoption order, and in appointing a guardian.\n18\n  It can also be revoked by the court \nand expires when a child reaches the age of majority.  When a person has not lived \nwith a child for three years\u2014as was the case with Ms. W and the younger daughter, \nwho was only two years old when Ms. W and Ms. G separated\u2014they must either rely \non the consent of all those already with parental responsibility,\n19\n or the court\u2019s \ndiscretion under s.10 to award a residence order, so as to obtain, again indirectly, \nparental responsibility. \n \nWe see then why obtaining parental responsibility for the younger daughter was at \nissue in the case.  Ms. W was not entitled to apply for a (joint) residence order as with \nthe older daughter, and had instead to appeal, from the outset,\n20\n to the court\u2019s \ndiscretion to grant the Order.  As mentioned, this was denied at trial level.  The judge \ninstead issued a sole residence order to Ms. G, attaching to it a series of s.8 specific \n                                                 \n17\n While child protection arguments will be put forward to justify these more onerous requirements, \nthat such considerations are not similarly stressed for biological parents is somewhat concerning.  This \nissue however, is beyond the scope of this note. \n18\n S.12(3). \n19\n S.10(5)(c). \n20\n While the court still has the ultimate authority to award or deny the order, the point is that certain \ncategories of parent have the direct right to apply, while others must be given permission to apply by \nthe court. \n 7 \nissue orders, \u201cwhich were designed to ensure that the appellant retained a significant \nrole in the lives of the children.\u201d21  It was this refusal which was appealed to the upper \ncourt, the appellant\u2019s counsel describing the resulting order \u201cas but a pale shadow\u201d of \nwhat Ms. W had requested.\n22\n  Ultimately, she was denied the ability to obtain parental \nresponsibility. \n \nWhy then is obtaining this legal status so important?  While some commentators have \nquestioned the importance of parental responsibility for de facto parenting,\n23\n it is an \nimportant practical and symbolic legal concept in the context of family relations.  \nParental responsibility is defined in s.3(1) of the Children Act as, \u201c\u2026.all the rights, \nduties and powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has \nin relation to the child and his property,\u201d and its regulation must be in accordance \nwith the guiding principle of the Act, the welfare of the child.\n24\n  Sally Sheldon has \nacknowledged several reasons why parental responsibility is important.\n25\n  Firstly, it \nallows an adult to take important decisions regarding a child\u2019s upbringing, to include \nwhere they shall live, how they shall be educated, what religion (if any) they shall be \nbrought up in, what non-essential medical treatment they shall receive, and to \nadminister the child\u2019s property.26  Parental responsibility may be held by more than \none person simultaneously,\n27\n and while a person holding parental responsibility can \nact alone on many issues, important decisions relating to, for example, the child\u2019s \nhome or education, need the consent of usually all those holding parental \n                                                 \n21\n Per Thorpe L.J., Re. G, supra n.1, para. 4. \n22\n Ibid, para. 17. \n23\n See Eekelaar (2001).  His arguments seem sound in instances where the parents are working together, \nbut where they disagree, to not have parental responsibility makes de facto parenting difficult indeed. \n24\n See s.1. \n25\n Sheldon, supra n.11, pp.94-95. \n26\n See further Barton and Douglas, supra n.7, p.114 for a more detailed list of the rights included within \nthe legal category of parental responsibility. \n27\n S.2(5)-(6). \n 8 \nresponsibility for the child.\n28\n  Secondly, Sheldon notes that parental responsibility can \nact as a spring-board for entitlement to other legal rights related to family policy, such \nas work-leave.\n29\n  Finally, she notes that parental responsibility accords the right to be \nheard in proceedings regarding a child\u2019s emigration, and to appoint a guardian for the \nchild upon one\u2019s death.30  Thus parental responsibility can be viewed as the first step \nto obtaining other \u2018parental rights\u2019. \n \nWith this brief outline, we begin to see the importance of securing parental \nresponsibility if a parent is to have a substantial role in the child\u2019s upbringing, and \nproper legal involvement in the child\u2019s life.  While in many instances de facto \nparenting will take place without this legal formality, in cases like Re. G where the \nadults involved have ended an intimate relationship and are in disagreement over \nsignificant issues, the practical salience of parental responsibility cannot be \nunderestimated.  Indeed, the central disagreement in Re. G was the fundamental \nquestion of Ms. W\u2019s status as the child\u2019s parent.  With no genetic connection to the \nchild, her ex-partner wanted her role confined to that of \u201can extended family member, \nnot in a parental position.\u201d31  As even the trial judge recognised, there was a clear \nattempt by Ms. G to marginalise Ms. W\u2019s role, culminating in a proposed move from \n                                                 \n28\n S.2(7). \n29\n See for example the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999 No.3312), \nwhereby persons either recognised as a parent on the birth certificate and\/or persons having parental \nresponsibility can apply for the leave to care for a child, under qualified conditions. \n30\n S.13 and 5(3) respectively. \n31\n Per Thorpe, L.J., Re. G supra n.1 at para. 11.  Note how Ms. G\u2019s statement here supports the rhetoric \nfrom traditional family rights and religious groups who spoke about the case in the media.  For \nexample, Dr. Adrian Rogers, an adviser to the Family Focus group said, \u201cThese two children are the \nwrong age to be brought up by a lesbian couple.  This woman has no genetic link to the children, she is \njust someone who has spent time with them,\u201d Pilditch (2005).  See also Norman Wells, of Family and \nYouth Concern, who said, \u201cThe female friends of a child\u2019s mother may well become significant figures \nin a child\u2019s life, but they can never provide an adequate substitute for the child\u2019s father and it is a \nmistake to pretend that they can,\u201d Dolan (2005). \n 9 \nShropshire to Cornwall.  The trial judge found that, \u201c\u2026.the proposed move must in \npart be deliberately designed to frustrate current contact arrangements.\u201d32 \n \nWhy then did the trial judge decline from indirectly granting parental responsibility, \nby granting the joint residence order as recommended by the CAFCASS officer \nassigned to the case?\n33\n  The trial judge is quoted as saying: \n \nIn my view such a sharing of parental responsibility would result in endless disputes between \nthe parties which may require the Court\u2019s intervention to resolve issues of education, \naccommodation, elective medical procedures and so forth which could not be in the long term \ninterests of these children.  A recent consultation document from CAFCASS encourages its \nofficers to consider shared residence orders where parental cooperation and practical \ncircumstances allow and it appear to be in the child\u2019s interests.  This does not seem to me to \nbe such a case.\n34\n \n \nHer decision then seems to rest on the conviction that as the appellant and respondent \nhad a hostile relationship, a joint residence order and shared parental responsibility \nwould be unworkable and that therefore it was better to grant sole residence, and \nproscribe certain actions, such as the planned move to Cornwall.  This stands in \ncontrast to the CAFCASS officer\u2019s optimistic belief \u201cthat the animosity between the \nparties would dissipate over time.\u201d35  While this view remains speculative, the trial \njudge seemed to gloss over, indeed omit an important point \u2013 that it is when the \nparents\u2019 relationship is acrimonious, that the holding of parental responsibility \nbecomes all the more significant.   \n                                                 \n32\n Per Thorpe, L.J., Re. G supra n.1 at para. 14, quoting Hughes, J. \n33\n See Re. G, ibid, at para. 9. \n34\n Per Thorpe, L.J., supra n.32.  Note that neither counsel was able to find the CAFCASS document \nthat Hughes J. was referring to. \n35\n Per Thorpe L.J., Re. G supra n.1, at para. 13. \n 10 \n \nIn acknowledging this however, I am not suggesting that the nature of the animosity \nshould be disregarded.  In too many cases, such \u2018animosity\u2019 is based on domestic \nviolence, other harmful power struggles, or it may involve a primary carer trying to \nrestrict the access of a dangerous, irresponsible or feckless parent in order to (justly) \nprotect the physical and\/or psychological welfare of the child.  In these cases, it would \ngenerally not be in the best interests of the child and\/or a primary carer, who is a \nvictim of such, to award a joint order.  Indeed, where there is base-line evidence that \nsuch a scenario exists, I would suggest that the case merits a rebuttable exemption \nfrom the \u2018fit-parent\u2019 framework I suggest below.  The trends in US law of \u2018failure-to-\nprotect\u2019 and \u2018friendly-parent\u2019 provisions36 highlight the perverse legal results which \ncan emerge if the dynamics of domestic violence (in its many forms) are not \nunderstood and addressed appropriately by legislation and the Courts.  In cases which \ndo not have such a dimension, where the person seeking the order has actively \ndemonstrated themselves to be a \u2018fit-parent\u2019, their entitlement to parental \nresponsibility should not hinge upon the co-operation of another parent.  To indulge in \nclich\u00e9s, their ability to parent should not be \u2018held to ransom\u2019 by an obstructive co-\nparent.   \n \nIf parental fitness is to be used as a judicial standard, it would have to somehow be \nstatutorily defined, in order to prevent it from being used as a vehicle for judicial \n                                                 \n36\n Most US States have now codified a \u2018failure to protect\u2019 standard in their child protective statutes and \napply these provisions to victims of domestic violence by charging them with neglect for failing to \nremove their children from violent surroundings.  See case such as Cathy G. (detailed in Miccio, K., \n1999) and In Re. Dalton 424 N.E.2d. 1226 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981).  A perpetrator of domestic violence, \nunder a \u2018friendly parent\u2019 provision can seem much more conciliatory and willing to co-operate than a \nparent who has been victimised by the perpetrator.  If a judge then fails to take into consideration the \ndomestic violence, the victim parent\u2019s refusal not to co-operate with the abusive parent makes them \nappear obstructive. \n 11 \nprejudice and stereotypes.  I suggest that, where appropriate, the chief consideration \nfor the \u2018fit-parent\u2019 criteria should be evidence of the applicant\u2019s productive and active \ninvolvement in caring for the child.\n37\n  Other proposed standards have included the \nEqual Parenting Council\u2019s \u2018good reason principle\u2019 - that a parent should be deemed \n\u2018fit\u2019, unless there is a good reason, supported by credible evidence, why this parent\u2019s \nrole should be excluded or restricted that would apply even if the parents were \ntogether.\n38\n  While I can understand the Council\u2019s logic in purporting this standard, \ngiven the argument that separated parents are held to \u2018higher standards\u2019 than non-\nseparated parents, such a principle perhaps remains too speculative and subjective for \na judicial standard in this area.  For example, is being a perpetrator of domestic \nviolence a currently acknowledged reason to deem a parent \u2018unfit\u2019 if they are still with \nthe other parent?  Similarly, would a person\u2019s sexuality be considered a sufficiently \n\u2018good reason\u2019?  As the law remains unclear about the \u2018good reasons\u2019 why parents \nshould be deemed \u2018unfit\u2019 when they are together, a standard which focuses more on \nactual parenting skills through a broad construct of active \u2018care\u2019 would charge judges \nwith considering true \u2018parental fitness\u2019.  It could also be reinforced with a list of \nprohibited considerations, such as gender, sexuality and race, and perhaps some \nindicative guidance on what active \u2018care\u2019 could incorporate. \n \nAs a final point, implicit in this \u2018holding to ransom\u2019 discussion, is that obstructive co-\nparents, where the animosity is not merited, should be better policed and sanctioned \nby the courts.  To elaborate specifically on how such should be done in practice is \n                                                 \n37\n This could clearly be applied in the specific to cases such as Re. G.  More generally however, I \nwould suggest that as parenting behaviours are not completely a matter of \u2018choice\u2019 (for example, only \nwomen remain entitled to extended maternity leave, while men have only two weeks paternity leave), \n\u2018care\u2019 should be given a broad definition, and should not be restricted entirely to the day-to-day care of \na child. \n38\n Equal Parenting Council (2003). \n 12 \nbeyond the scope of this note.  However, given, for example, complaints about the \nfamily court system from father\u2019s rights groups\u2014which are currently shaping up quite \ndivisively for parenthood\n39\u2014there is pressing need for this \u2018holding to ransom\u2019 to be \ndisparaged by the courts.  It is needed not only because it is morally reprehensible, but \nalso because, if left unaddressed, it risks being used as an argument for the promotion \nand adaptation of de-contextualised and homogenous provisions, such as \npresumptions of joint residence upon parental separation. \n \nWhile I have not elaborated on how courts could perhaps better manage obstructive \nparents, the current Government has made recent attempts.  Getting back to the case, \nin his concluding paragraph, Thorpe L.J. referred to the Government\u2019s recent \nconsultation paper, and their publication of the draft Children (Contact) and Adoption \nBill, designed to introduce new powers and management techniques for judges to \ncombat \u2018obstructive\u2019 behaviour.  A solid body of case-law, like Re. G, which \nfacilitates and encourages the granting of joint orders and parental responsibility to \n\u2018fit parents\u2019 through a recognition of their active \u2018care\u2019, would be an encouraging and \nsupportive judiciary-based compliment to these, hopefully positive, Government \ninitiatives.  Indeed, it may help to progressively shape their final form in a way that is \nsocially textured as opposed to prejudiced or stereotypical.   \n \nIn this first part of the note I have dealt with the specific legal issues of the case, and \nelaborated more broadly on some of the important derivative issues, particularly in the \ncontext of legally recognising social parents.  Drawing attention to both the problems \nof the parental responsibility framework under the Children Act and the importance of \n                                                 \n39\n For example, increased rhetoric of \u2018mother-blaming\u2019 and feminist bias, are replacing substantive \ncritiques about a system which fails both mothers and fathers.  \n 13 \nthis legal category, especially where the parents separate and disagree over crucial \nissues, I have tried to suggest a workable and progressive standard that judges should \nuse when a parent must appeal to their discretion if they are to be allowed to apply for, \nand obtain, parental responsibility.  Although the \u2018fit-parent\u2019 standard cannot be \napplied homogenously as it has the clear potential to be manipulated in certain \ncircumstances, if defined appropriately, it would be a useful judicial tool in many \n\u2018separation\u2019 cases.  A definition based on a workable construct of \u2018care\u2019 has, I suggest, \nthe potential to discourage and disrupt the use of stereotypes, particularly those based \nupon gender and sexuality, which have so often been used in a prejudiced manner in \nassigning \u2018parental rights\u2019 and legal entitlements.40 \n \n \nCOMMENDING RE. G \n \nWhilst the preceding section has addressed the legal hurdles that Ms. W had to \nsurpass in order to obtain parental responsibility under the current legislative \nframework, what I want to discuss in this section are the more positive aspects of Re. \nG and Lord Justice Thorpe\u2019s written judgment.  However, in some instances I suggest \nthat these are not without their specific shortcomings. \n \nFirstly, the case must be seen as a positive step in the more general struggle of \nobtaining legal recognition for same-sex relationships and parenting.  Essentially, Re. \nG has extended some important existent case-law to same-sex parents, which until \nnow had only been applied to heterosexual parents.  In his judgment, Thorpe, L.J. \n                                                 \n40\n For example, lesbian mothers have historically been denied parental rights on the basis of their \nsexuality, as opposed to any real question of their \u2018parental fitness\u2019.  \n 14 \naligns three main bodies of authority in justifying his award of joint residence.  Firstly, \nhe refers to the case of A v A\n41\n, and the intractable disputes between the parents, Mr. \nand Mrs. A.  Whilst the respondent\u2019s counsel sought to distinguish this case on the \nbasis that Mr. and Mrs. A had been married, and thus had automatic parental \nresponsibility,\n42\n Thorpe L.J. applied the case as a point of general principle that courts \nshould encourage co-operation between acrimonious parents.  He cited Wall, J. (as he \nthen was): \n \nControl is not what this family needs.  What it needs is co-operation.  By making a shared \nresidence order the court is making that point.  These parents have joint and equal parental \nresponsibility.  The residence of the children is shared between them.  These facts need to be \nrecognised by an order for shared residence.\n43\n \n \nWall, J. thought that making a sole residence order in favour of Mr. A. would be \nmisinterpreted, despite his personal belief that Mr. A. would honour the necessary \narrangements.  In the context of Re. G then, the lesser award made by Hughes, J. \nwould, under this authority, be tantamount to endorsing Ms. G\u2019s attempts to \u2018control\u2019 \nMs. W\u2019s relationship with M.  In awarding a joint residence order and thus parental \nresponsibility, Thorpe L.J. instead offered the clear message that Ms. W was the equal \nparent of M, and that Ms. G needed to co-operate with her, whether they were \n\u2018married\u2019 or not. \n \nThe second body of authority refers to applications for parental responsibility.  Most \nof the case-law involving parental responsibility applications refers to unmarried \n                                                 \n41\n A v A (Shared Residence) [2004] 1 FLR 1195, hereinafter A v A. \n42\n Per Thorpe, L.J., Re. G supra n.1 at para. 21. \n43\n Ibid. \n 15 \nfathers\u2019 requests for parental responsibility orders (PROs).  In brief, a three-fold \ncriterion of \u2018commitment, attachment and motivation\u2019 has emerged as a guide for \nwhether or not a PRO should be awarded.\n44\n  Thorpe L.J. also draws attention to the \nmore recent authority, which emphasises \u201cthe benefits to be achieved for a child by \nthe grant of parental responsibility to both parents\u201d.45  In support, whilst PROs are not \nsimply granted to unmarried fathers upon request, they have been typically awarded \nunless there is a strong reason as to why they should not be.  As Wall J. said: \n \n\u2026.wherever possible, the law should confer on a concerned father that stamp of approval \nbecause he has shown himself willing and anxious to pick up the responsibility of fatherhood \nand not to deny or avoid it.\n46\n \n \nWhat Thorpe L.J. has established in Re. G, is that this standard or \u2018threshold\u2019 should \nbe similarly applied, in the specific, to same-sex parents-  \u201c\u2026.what Ward L.J. had to \nsay of fathers is of application to same sex parents.\u201d47  Thorpe L.J. refers to pivotal \ncases, the third body of authority, which trace judicial acceptance of \u2018family diversity\u2019.  \nThese include Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd.,\n48\n and the recent \nGhaidan v Godin-Mendoza.\n49\n  By family diversity, he is referring to same-sex couples, \nwho have historically been denied both rights of legal recognition, and parenthood \nstatus where they are the non-biological parent.  However, the recognition of same-\nsex relationships is modeled on the exclusive heterosexual couple.  While this may be \nthe case for many non-heterosexual relationships, it continues to deny recognition to \n                                                 \n44\n See Bainham (2005) pp.205-210. \n45\n Per Thorpe, L.J., Re. G supra n.1 at para. 22, referring to the judgment of Ward L.J. in Re C and V \n[1998] 1 FLR 392. \n46\n Ibid, at page 397.  Note that refusals to grant PROs have been rare.  See further Sheldon (2001), \npp.103-4. \n47\n Per Thorpe, L.J., Re. G supra n.1 at para. 22. \n48\n Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd. [2001] 1 AC 27, hereinafter Fitzpatrick v Sterling. \n49\n Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza [2004] 3 WLR 113, herinafter Mendoza Case. \n 16 \nvarious others, and has been an important criticism of recent legislative reforms, \nespecially the Civil Partnership Act 2004.\n 50\n  Therefore, whilst Re. G is an important \nbreak-through for same-sex couples who have children, in that their sexuality must \nbecome irrelevant to the existent and future case-law relating to parental \nresponsibility, it is perhaps only the beginning of a longer process of truly recognising \n\u2018family diversity\u2019.  \n \nTo demonstrate, as Ms. W was a non-biological parent, it could be argued that Thorpe \nL.J. has further broadened the \u2018threshold\u2019 precedent to include all social parents who \nseek parental responsibility through clauses such as s.10 of the Children Act.  \nHowever, the extent of this recognition, in line with how same-sex relationships are \nbeing recognised more generally, may depend on how closely the \u2018family unit\u2019 \nresembles the heterosexual and privatised two-parent model, or what Martha Fineman \nhas termed, \u2018the sexual family\u2019 51 .  For example, would a \u2018third\u2019 parent, in a \ncollaborative family (sexually connected or otherwise) be afforded similar treatment \nunder similar circumstances, or is the \u2018threshold\u2019 reserved for \u201c\u2026.homosexual \ncouple[s] whose relationship is marriage-like in the same ways that unmarried \nheterosexual couple\u2019s relationship is marriage-like and indeed in an analogous \nsituation\u201d?52 \n \nThis then introduces us, somewhat ironically through a criticism, to what I described \nas the second commendable aspect of the Re. G judgment.  In brief, and subject to the \nsame \u2018sexual family\u2019 criticism, the ruling in Re. G gave equal recognition to a parent, \nwhose status was based, in the main, on social care-taking factors as opposed to \n                                                 \n50\n See Barker (2004). \n51\n Fineman, supra n.4. \n52\n Per Baroness Hale, Mendoza Case, supra n.48 at para. 143. \n 17 \nbiological connections.  While of course Ms. W\u2019s status was further based on her \nintimate relationship connection to Ms. G (thus the \u2018sexual family\u2019 criticism) it is still \na powerful judicial statement in support and recognition of social parenting. It is \nimportant to recognise this.  Recent reforms to the Children Act will soon provide \nnew mechanisms for civil partners and step-parents to apply directly for parental \nresponsibility.\n53\n  However, social parents who are not in a legally recognised union \nwith a parent who already has parental responsibility, will still have to rely on being \ngranted a joint residence order if they are to obtain parental responsibility.  Under Re. \nG then, where a person applying for a joint residence order, be it through the three-\nyear requirement or the court\u2019s discretionary powers, if they satisfy the \u2018commitment, \nattachment and motivation\u2019 threshold, 54  and it is in the child\u2019s interest, parental \nresponsibility cannot be denied on the basis that there is no biological connection. \n \nOne final commendable point is that this decision was reached unanimously.  The two \nother Lord Justices agreed, without reservation to Lord Justice Thorpe\u2019s judgment in \nupholding the appeal.  This then lends strong support to the case being used positively \nfor future cases similarly involving same-sex and\/or social parents.  While we must \nrely on the incremental development of the common law to extend the precedent to \nthose families and parenthood situations which are fashioned on the traditional \n\u2018sexual family\u2019 model, the potential impact of the case should not be underestimated.  \nThe traditional assumptions about parenthood, which prize the marital family unit, \nbiological connections, as well as privatised care and gendered parenting roles, are \ndeeply ingrained in Western cultures.\n55\n  So while Re. G does not perhaps disrupt all \n                                                 \n53\n See supra n. 12. \n54\n Preventing applications from baby-sitters, acquaintances and so forth, as opposed to actual \u2018social \nparents\u2019.  \n55\n See Fineman, supra n.9. \n 18 \nthese assumptions, it is a notable challenge which, at the least, aligns judicial thinking \nwith recent statutory reforms, and at best, provides a legal avenue into further relaxing \ncurrent boundary-based definitions of parenthood and families, in favour of redefining \nit to incorporate \u2018care\u2019 as the core principle.  \n \n \nACKNOWLEDMENTS \n \nI\u2019d like to thank Marie Fox, Tony Hobbs, Matija Longar, Sally Sheldon and the \nFeminist Legal Studies case-note editors for their helpful comments and advice on \nearlier drafts of this note.   \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBainham, A., \u201cParentage, Parenthood and Parental Responsibility:  Subtle, Elusive \nYet Important Distinctions\u201d in What is a Parent:  A Socio-Legal Analysis, eds.
