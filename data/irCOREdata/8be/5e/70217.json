INTRODUCTION\nMany physical work environments such as construction\nsites, factories and storage depots, are extremely hazardous\nand each year numerous people are injured in work-related\naccidents. To ensure workers\u2019 health and safety legal au-\nthorities such as national governments or industrial bodies,\ndefine health and safety (H&S) regulations that industrial\norganisations must comply with. These regulations define\ngoals and general policies that \u2014 when followed \u2014 promote\nhealth and safety in the workplace. Policies may take the\nform of tasks that need to be performed or dictate limita-\ntions in certain aspects of a job. However, only rarely do\npolicies prescribe the methods or techniques that compa-\nnies need to employ in order to achieve the outlined health\nand safety goals. This leaves it up to industry to find ef-\nfective and efficient ways to comply with health and safety\nregulations. Companies need to be able to establish that\nthey comply with regulations, in front of governing bodies,\ninsurance companies or legal authorities. While this can be\ndone in several ways, it commonly involves data collection\nand record keeping, a process that is time consuming and\ncostly.\nCurrently, most health and safety systems rely on human\ninformation gathering and recording in the field, with deci-\nsions being taken by workers, supervisors or back office staff\nprocessing the data off-line. In the NEMO project we are\nexploring an alternative vision in which H&S support is pro-\nvided by physical work artefacts, such as tools, augmented\nwith cooperating mobile nodes featuring both sensors and\nactuators and communicating over ad-hoc wireless networks.\nThese mobile systems would be able to observe the working\nactivities taking place, evaluate compliance with health and\nsafety regulations and assist or actively enforce compliance\nwith these regulations. This vision creates a new field of\nwork in the area of mobile computing support for health\nand safety and in [5] we have outlined some of the challenges\nassociated with this domain.\nIn this paper we focus on our experiences of designing,\nimplementing and evaluating a prototype Hand Arm Vibra-\ntion (HAV) monitoring system based on the NEMO vision of\naugmented work artefacts. Long term exposure to hand arm\nvibration can lead to serious health conditions such as \u201cvi-\nbration white finger\u201d (VWF), and existing health and safety\nregulations specify limits on workers\u2019 exposure to HAV when\noperating heavy vibrating machinery such as hydraulic drills\nand breakers. Our experimental system comprises a collec-\ntion of tools, augmented with wireless sensor nodes, personal\nuser devices and mobile computers that collaborate in an\nad-hoc manner in order to collect HAV exposure informa-\ntion. This information is available in real-time to workers\nin the field and subsequently to management via a back-end\ndatabase. Our design allows health and safety regulations\nspecified at the enterprise level to be embedded within the\nwireless sensor nodes, allowing them to operate without any\ninfrastructural support. This is crucial for workers who often\nhave to operate in areas with limited or no wireless commu-\nnication infrastructure. The system was evaluated through\na two week field trial that took place with the collaboration\nof a major UK construction and maintenance company.\n2. DOMAIN ANALYSIS\n2.1 The Hand Arm Vibration Problem\nLong-term exposure to hand arm vibration can lead to\nserious health conditions such as \u201cvibration white finger\u201d\n(VWF) and in extreme cases to life-long disability. VWF is\ntriggered by excessive use of vibrating machinery such as hy-\ndraulic drills and breakers, and causes the fingers to become\nnumb and begin turning white. As the disease progresses it\ncan become irreversible; the person suffers increasingly fre-\nquent painful attacks at any time and may even lose their\nfingers (typically this only happens in extreme cases, for ex-\nample, when people are working with vibrating machinery\nin very cold conditions, as is the case in the forestry industry\namong people working with chainsaws).\nExtensive health and safety regulations exist to limit work-\ners\u2019 exposure to HAV. For example, in 2005 the UK Parlia-\nment introduced the Control of Vibration at Work Regula-\ntions [10]. These regulations set limits for daily exposure\nto vibration, define methods for their calculation and for-\nmulate guidelines for monitoring an employee\u2019s exposure to\nvibration. The guidelines place a responsibility on employ-\ners to assess each individual employee\u2019s exposure risk and to\nconsider the specific working conditions of each employee.\nWhen it is not possible to eliminate a worker\u2019s exposure to\nvibration then suitable health surveillance must be put in\nplace and immediate action be taken if specific vibration\nlimits are exceeded.\nThe damage caused by exposure to vibrations is a combi-\nnation of both the frequency of the vibrating tool and the\nduration of the exposure. Using a tool that vibrates at a\nlow frequency for a long time can be as damaging as using\na heavily vibrating tool for a short time. Thus regulations\nspecify two figures for exposure duration, a limit to the over-\nall daily trigger time (Daily exposure limit), and a limit on\nshort-term exposure to very high levels of vibration (Daily\nexposure action). These limits are defined in terms of the\naverage daily exposure dose A(8):\n\u2022 Daily exposure limit value = A(8) of 2.5m\/s2\n\u2022 Daily exposure action value = A(8) of 5.0m\/s2\nA(8) is defined as ahv\np\nT\/8 where\nahv = actual vibration acceleration rate expressed in\nm\/s2\nT = actual exposure duration expressed in hours\nIn turn, ahv is composed of the root\u2013mean\u2013square accel-\neration magnitudes in three orthogonal directions, x, y and\nz, at the vibrating surface in contact with the hand. Where\ndaily vibration exposure A(8) is above 2.5m\/s2 but below\n5.0m\/s2, the following steps should be taken: Inform work-\ners of risk, carry out regular health surveillance of worker,\nrecord assessment. Where daily vibration exposure exceeds\n5.0m\/s2, the following actions must be taken: Limit usage\nimmediately, rotate workers, introduce other working meth-\nods to reduce HAV. Since in practice ahv is not known for\na specific piece of work, equipment manufacturers publish\nestimated ahv values for each individual tool, which can be\nused to estimate an operator\u2019s exposure.\nThere is a distinct lack of automated solutions for assisting\nwith HAV H&S rule compliance. For example, vibration ex-\nposure data is typically manually recorded by operatives on\npaper sheets, which are then entered by hand into a health\nand safety information system. Moreover, key data such as\ntrigger time must be estimated by operatives, most often\nhours after work has been completed. This of course raises\nserious concerns with respect to completeness, accuracy and\nconsistency of captured data. The current practice can be\nimproved using mobile data entry solutions based on hand-\nheld wireless computers. Yet, while mobile solutions reduce\nthe need for paper forms they still suffer from the fact that\nthey rely on human information gathering and recording\nin the field. In addition, current solutions are tailored for\noff-line processing of data in the back office, ignoring the\npotential benefits for real-time information in the field.\n2.2 Requirements Capture\nIn close collaboration with a major UK company that car-\nries out road maintenance and construction operations, we\nset out to design, implement and evaluate a Hand Arm Vi-\nbration (HAV) monitoring system, based on our approach of\naugmenting work artefacts. Our team consisted of computer\nscientists, psychologists, ethnographers and organisational\nmanagement experts. Together, we engaged with the com-\npany on various levels, ranging from high-level management\nto workers in the filed, to investigate current work practices,\nidentify technical and usability requirements, and anticipate\ndeployment challenges. The following gives an outline of our\napproach and introduces the requirements that we gathered.\n2.2.1 Methodology\nTo inform the design and elicit requirements we followed\na two-pronged approach. On the one hand, we undertook\nextensive work place studies and interviews to understand\ncurrent work practices. On the other hand, we generated\ndesign sketches to elicit concrete feedback.\nIn total we conducted over twenty formal interviews with\nmanagers and employees and 16 full days of work obser-\nvation. Field observation days also involved informal dis-\ncussions with upwards of 25 operatives going about their\ndaily work, with the fieldwork being conducted across three\ndifferent regional sections of the company, each of which\nwith its own safety culture and traditions. An important\nresult with respect to risks from vibration and noise expo-\nsure (\u201cinvisible risks\u201d) was that it emerged that these were\nappropriately assessed and their mitigation documented at\nan organisational level, yet were often underestimated or\nviewed as insignificant by operatives due to the apparently\nloose linkage between the risk and its outcomes. For exam-\nFigure 1: Screen shot of the video sketch used for\nrequirements capturing. The figure shows a mockup\nof a hand-held user device and a heavy duty jack-\nhammer augmented with a mockup sensor node.\nple, asking operatives about the risks of hand arm vibration\nwas regularly met with a variation on \u201cwell, I\u2019ve been do-\ning this job for twenty years and I haven\u2019t had any problems\nwith it\u201d. Whilst everyone seemed to know someone who\nhad suffered from vibration white finger through excessive\nexposure to vibration, this was insufficient to make the risk\nappear \u201creal\u201d in relation to their own conduct.\nWe produced design sketches in the form of videos that\nshowed technology mockups operated by members of the\ndesign team. These videos were shown to management and\noperatives alike to force a discussion about concrete design\nchoices (see Figure 1). We found video sketches to be an ex-\ntremely helpful means to bridge the gap between researchers\nwith a technology vision and practitioners concerned with\ngetting their job done. The design that emerged over time\nconsisted of two different types of devices, a wireless sensor\nnode that can be attached to various pieces of equipment\nto measure vibrations, and a user device with a display for\nuse by operatives. The user device builds on the concept\nof a dosimeter for radiation detection and extends it to the\nrealm of vibration exposure. Using video sketches as well as\nhardware mockups we were able to discuss and settle issues\nrelated to form factor, user interaction and device place-\nment, among other things.\n2.2.2 Requirements\nThe requirements that we collected included usability re-\nquirements, data requirements and operational requirements.\nSome of the key requirements, are listed below; the identi-\nfiers U, D and O indicate the type of requirement, usability,\ndata and operational respectively:\nU1 The system must not require users to perform exten-\nsive setup or configuration tasks in the field. Time\npressure, protective clothing (gloves), and users\u2019 un-\nwillingness to engage with technology put severe con-\nstraints on the user interface.\nU2 Users must be able to interact with the system with\nminimal training. The rationale for this is the skill set\nof the targeted user population and the frequent use\nof temporary workers.\nU3 User devices must be generic and reusable, so that a\nbroken unit can be replaced with a new one. This\nrequires data to be replicated seamlessly across device\nand infrastructure.\nD1 The system must generate accurate, personalized vi-\nbration exposure records for each equipment operator.\nThis is crucial to enable companies to demonstrate\ncompliance.\nD2 Equipment operators must have access to their personal\nvibration record while operating equipment, i.e. in the\nfield. Compliance issues (e.g., reaching daily exposure\nlimits) must be indicated immediately.\nD3 The system must be able to generate company-wide\ncompliance reports.\nO1 The system must be able to operate without connec-\ntion between devices in the field and backend infras-\ntructure. Connectivity at temporary work sites is poor\nand cannot be guaranteed.\nO2 The sensor and user device, which are both battery op-\nerated, must support continuous operation for several\ndays or even weeks. Frequent charging is not accept-\nable because of U1.\nO3 The hardware must be extremely robust and be able to\noperate in adverse conditions (vibrations, heat, water,\ndust, physical impact). The reason for this of course\nlies in the fact that the system is used at construction\nsites in all weather conditions.\n3. SYSTEM DESIGN\nDriven by the set of requirements described in the previ-\nous section we designed a system for monitoring HAV using\naugmented artefacts. From an abstract point of view, our\nsystem is a collection of mobile wireless nodes: sensor nodes\nattached to equipment such as drills, user devices carried or\nworn by users and mobile gateway units installed in vehicles\n(see Figure 2). Each device type serves a distinct function:\n\u2022 sensor nodes measure and interpret vibrations\n\u2022 user devices record and display data related to a user\u2019s\nvibration exposure\n\u2022 gateway units store and forward vibration data to the\nbackend infrastructure.\nEach node is an autonomous unit capable of operating\nwithout any other unit. Yet, if devices come within proxim-\nity of each other, they spontaneously establish a communi-\ncation link. In particular, sensor nodes send vibration data\nto the user device, and user devices upload user data onto\nthe gateway unit from where it is forwarded to the backend\ninfrastructure for permanent storage.\nFigure 3 depicts the system model of the NEMO system.\nIt shows sensor node A within communication range of user\ndevices 1 and 2. Likewise, user device 4 is within communi-\ncation range of a gateway unit.\n In -Vehicle \nSystem\nEnterprise\nSystem\nNetwork node \nActuator component \n( including displays ) \nSensor component\nIntermittent \ncommunication\nFigure 2: HAV monitoring system\nA key issue for the NEMO system is to ensure that vibra-\ntion data is always recorded by the user device of the person\nwho is actually using the equipment. While in practice only\none person operates each piece of equipment at each point\nin time, there may be several \u2018bystanders\u2019, i.e. workers who\nare in close proximity of the equipment without operating it.\nIn this case, the NEMO system must ensure that data from\nthe sensor node is recorded only on the operators user device\nand not on the bystanders\u2019 devices. We call this the asso-\nciation problem. This problem arises in any systems where\nit is necessary to determine, for example, which worker is\nusing a specific tool.\nWe wished to design the system such that the NEMO user\ndevice could function as a general purpose H&S tag. From\nthis perspective, it made little sense to develop a custom so-\nlution for solving the association problem between a worker\nand a drill. For example, the particular characteristics of\nthe drilling scenario, where the tool in operation and the\noperative experience correlated vibrations, would suggest a\nsolution similar to the one presented in [15] \u2014 identifying\nthe tool user, through the correlation of accelerometer read-\nings on both the tool and the operative. Another approach\nwould be to augment the drill handle with a short range\nRFID reader in order to read an RFID tag from the opera-\ntive\u2019s glove. Although both these approaches would provide\na reliable solution to the association problem for this specific\napplication, it would not generalise to other H&S scenarios.\nWe decided to implement two distinct approaches to the\nassociation problem in order to explore design alternatives.\nFirstly, we built a solution that required involvement of the\ndrill operator. Specifically, the system required the drill op-\nerator to press a button on their personal NEMO device\nbefore they started using the drill. The button press was\nonly required when a new worker was about to use the same\ndrill \u2014 i.e. on a change of operator. This approach suffers\nfrom a number of obvious shortcomings. Most importantly,\nthe requirement for minimal impact on users is not met \u2014\nthe workers have to change their work practice due to the\nnew system. In addition, the fact that the association relies\n \nFigure 3: NEMO Devices\non user input makes the system susceptible to human er-\nror. However, the approach has the benefit that when used\ncorrectly, it provides an unambiguous indication of the tool\noperator.\nThe second approach that we implemented was to mea-\nsure the proximity between the drill and all personal NEMO\ndevices using the wireless interface on each node. This ap-\nproach was developed on the assumption that over a period\nof time, the worker operating the drill would spend more\ntime closer to the drill sensor node than all the other work-\ners in the field. This approach appears to satisfy all require-\nments established by the requirements capture phase, if it\ncan be shown to work reliably in the field.\nIn addition to the association problem, our abstract design\nalso raises issues with respect to support for \u201cdisconnected\noperation\u201d. One of the characteristics of the HAV monitor-\ning systems is that the operating environment is unknown,\nwith minimal or no infrastructural support. For example, a\npatching gang is normally sent out to perform a task in a\ncompany owned vehicle. However, the actual location where\nthe tarmac is to be patched may be quite far from the parked\nvehicle, depending on traffic conditions and availability of\nparking spaces. This implies that any infrastructure carried\nwithin the vehicle may not always be available to the field\ncomponents. These characteristics have direct implications\non the communication requirements as well as the design of\nthe overall system. Indeed, the mobile nodes that are de-\nployed in the field (i.e. the drill sensor node and the personal\nNEMO devices) are required to operate without any access\nto a back-end infrastructure. This implies that the field\ncomponents should be able to fully realise the H&S regula-\ntions specified by the company, in complete isolation. This\nindicates a departure from the traditional design of a wire-\nless sensor network where the sensor nodes push their sensor\nreadings to a back-end infrastructure that implements the\napplication logic.\nIn the developed HAV monitoring system the functional-\nity of monitoring the use of drills in the field, calculating\nthe exposure to HAV, and reporting violations to HAV reg-\nulations, is fully embedded within the nodes deployed in\nthe field. This approach allows the relocation of the deci-\nsion making competence from the back-end infrastructure\nto \u201cwhere the action is\u201d. We have successfully employed\nthis approach in the past to support compliance with H&S\nregulations for storage of chemical containers [19]. The ben-\nefits of this approach in the context of the HAV monitoring\nsystem are:\n\u2022 responsiveness and immediate decisions when and where\nthey are required.\n\u2022 low communication requirements and therefore low power\nrequirements.\n\u2022 simple deployment.\nThe low range communication that was employed in the\ndevelopment of the field components was sufficient to realise\nthe HAV monitoring system in the field.\n4. IMPLEMENTATION\n4.1 NEMO Nodes\n4.1.1 Drill Sensor Node\nThe drill sensor node consists of a Particles Smart-it [21], a\nmotes-like wireless sensing node based on a PIC18F6720 mi-\ncrocontroller, with a TR1001 transceiver and an accelerom-\neter sensor. In order to accurately calculate the HAV ex-\nposure of a particular user, the drill sensor node is required\nto\n1. identify to user devices the type of drill the sensor is\nattached to, and\n2. measure the exact amount of time the drill is being\nused.\nThe former is achieved by assigning a tool ID to the sensor\nnode during installation. The latter requires a mechanism\nthat allows the drill sensor node to identify the exact time\nthat the drill is actually operating (i.e. drilling) and we\ndiscuss the design of this mechanism in detail below.\nThe physical characteristics of the augmented tool played\na significant role in the design of the drill\u2019s activity recogni-\ntion mechanism. An obvious approach for identifying when\na tool is on or off is to hook into its existing circuitry and\nmonitor when the on\/off switch is pressed. However, hy-\ndraulic or pneumatic drills do not contain any electrical\nparts and turning these drills on or off does not involve\nany electrical circuitry. One possible approach would be\nto develop our own on\/off trigger that would be incorpo-\nrated in the existing manual on\/off switch. However, such\nan approach would reduce dramatically the deployability of\nthe system. In addition, a common practice for construc-\ntion companies is to hire tools on demand for performing a\nparticular construction task. This means that any augmen-\ntation of such tools should be simple and easy to install;\neasy enough to be performed by any worker at the time the\ntools are delivered by the hiring company. For the design\nof the drill sensor node this meant that it should, ideally,\ninvolve a single component that can be easily attached to\nthe tool.\n \n \nFigure 4: The drill sensor node\nWith such a requirement in place, the obvious approach\nwas to develop a drill node that would be able to sense the\ndrill\u2019s activity based on the tools vibrations. Indeed, the\ndrill sensor node implemented is able to monitor the tool\u2019s\nmovements through an accelerometer, and identify the time\nthe drill is actually drilling. When the sensor node discovers\nthat the drill is operating, it measures the time that the tool\nis in operation. When the drill stops, the sensor node sends\nthe total amount of drilling time to the operative\u2019s personal\ndevice over the wireless interface.\nThe drill sensor node is attached to the drill as shown\non Figure 4. The node monitors the movement of the drill\nthrough the attached accelerometer, capturing acceleration\nvalues at a sampling rate of 70-80Hz. In order to calculate\nreliably the activity of the drill, the sensor node maintains a\nsliding window of 50 samples. The identification of the drill\u2019s\nactivity involves the calculation of three different metrics:\n\u2022 Whether the drill is vibrating (true\/false): the sensor\nnode checks for periodic up\/down movement through\nthe accelerometer values. Specifically, the device mea-\nsures the number of times the accelerometer values\ncross the 0g point \u2014 properly adjusted to account for\ngravitational acceleration \u2014 within the period of the\nsliding window. If that number is sufficient (more than\n5 times) the drill is considered to be vibrating. In or-\nder to compensate for any noise on the accelerometer\nreadings, the 0g point is defined as values within the\nrange of (-0.5g, 0.5g).\n\u2022 The standard deviation of the accelerometer values:\nthis is used as an indication of the vibration frequency.\n\u2022 The average amplitude of vibrations.\nThe drill\u2019s state is identified through certain thresholds\nspecified for the three metrics:\ndrillOn := vibrating = true \u2227 stdev > Dth\u2227\namplitude > Ath\nwhere Dth is the threshold for standard deviation and Ath\nis the threshold for average amplitude. The values of the\nFigure 5: The NEMO user device\nthresholds were determined by the system developers during\na calibration phase. The specific values that were used are\nDth = 7 and Ath = 3g. The use of a sliding window of 50\nsamples and a sampling rate of 70-80Hz allows for a timely\ndetection of the drill\u2019s state. This in practice means that\nby the time the drill starts drilling, the sensor node requires\napproximately less than half a second to detect this1.\nWhen drilling starts, the sensor node measures the to-\ntal drilling time, while at the same time it continues to\ncapture acceleration samples in order to detect the end of\ndrilling. When the drill stops, the sensor node sends a mes-\nsage over the wireless link to the operant\u2019s user device with\nthe amount of time that the drill was on.\n4.1.2 User device\nThe user device consists of a Particles Smart-it (wireless\nsensing node), an LCD display, and a button for user inter-\naction. The purpose of the NEMO user device is to collect\ndata about the exposure of the user to vibrations and trans-\nfer that data back to the in-vehicle computer (see Figure\n5). Moreover, it offers an interface to the worker where they\ncan see details about their exposure to vibrations, or alerts\nin the case where they have violated regulations related to\nhand-arm vibration.\nWhen the user device is switched on, it can be associ-\nated with a particular worker via the in-vehicle computer\n(or it will fall back to the worker that it was associated with\nthe last time it was used). After this initialisation phase\nthe NEMO device becomes a personalised unit that holds\ninformation about the particular worker. In case of a mal-\nfunction, the worker can pick a new NEMO device at any\ntime, associate it with himself via the in-vehicle computer\nand continue working as usual.\nIn the case when we require manual intervention to form\n1Normally it is not necessary for all values in the window to\ncorrespond to the drilling vibrations. In practice when 70%\nof the samples in the window (35 samples) correspond to the\ndrilling vibrations the frequency and amplitude values offer\na clear indication of the drill\u2019s activity.\nFigure 6: The In-Vehicle computer\nassociations, workers are required to press the button at the\ntop of the device when they take over drilling duties. This\nbutton\u2013press switches the NEMO device to vibration moni-\ntoring state. In that state the device receives messages from\nthe drill sensor node and records the duration of vibration\nthe worker is exposed to.\nThe personal NEMO is equipped with 512KB of FLASH\nmemory to store the drilling records transmitted by the drill.\nEach record consists of a timestamp (4 bytes), the duration\nof a drilling burst (2 bytes) and the type of the drill (2\nbytes). With a record size of 8 bytes, the local memory is\ncapable of holding more than 18 hours of drilling time \u2014\nassuming a worst case scenario of a drilling burst every one\nsecond \u2014 which is well beyond the duration of an 8 hour\nshift. At the end of a shift the user device can upload all\nrecords related to hand-arm vibration to the in-vehicle unit\nand through that to the back-end database.\n4.2 In-Vehicle Hub\nWe employ an in-vehicle system developed by Lancaster\nUniversity and In Touch Ltd. The vehicle computer is an Ar-\ncom Viper computer [2], running windows CE 5 and utilises\na Trakm8 T4 [22] unit installed in the vehicle to communi-\ncate with the backend over GPRS (see Figure 6).\nThe NEMO software that runs on the in-vehicle unit is\nused to:\n1. communicate with the NEMO devices in order to:\n(a) Associate user NEMO devices with workers.\n(b) Retrieve HAV exposure records from the NEMO\ndevices at the end of their shift.\n2. communicate with the back-end database in order to\nupload HAV exposure records.\nIn general, the workers are required to use the invehicle\napplication only at the beginning and end of their shift. At\nthe beginning of their shift, they need to use the application\nin order to select the worker that is associated with eac\n drilltype \nPK drillTypeID \nmodel\ndescription \nvibrMagnitude\nstDevThreshold \nampThreshold\ndrilling \nPK logDate\nPK ,FK 1 employeeID\nPK ,FK 2 drillTypeID\nusageTime\nemployee \nPK employeeID \nfirstName\nlastName\nconfiguration \nPK valName\nvalType \nvalData \nFigure 7: The back-end database\nNEMO device. At the end of their shift, they select the\nuploading function that retrieves all HAV records from the\nNEMO devices and transmits them to the back-end over the\nT4 unit.\n4.3 Back-End Database\nThe HAV monitoring system provides a feed that can be\nused to produce management systems. One of the NEMO\nproject partners (in conjunction with the University) has\ndeveloped a combined database and web access system that\nstores all the information collected by the remote NEMO\nobjects and allows operators at central offices to view and\nuse this data.\nAs discussed earlier, at the end of each shift the personal\nNEMO units worn by the operators upload information re-\ngarding the worker\u2019s exposure to vibrations to the in vehi-\ncle unit. This unit then communicates this information via\nGPRS to a back-end server which stores it in a database.\nThe drilling events are registered in the database as records\nthat include the ID values for the tool and operator, time\nstamped together with the usage time (Figure 7).\nAccess to the information stored in the database is pro-\nvided via a web front end that allows authenticated users to\nmodify or add new information about operators and drills,\nas well as inserting configuration data that can be trans-\nmitted to the remote units. The users can also query the\ndatabase to produce usage logs for tools and operators, as\nwell as periodical and exception reports that can assist man-\nagers in identifying problem areas.\n5. EVALUATION\nThe evaluation of the HAV monitoring system involved\na small scale deployment of the system in a road mainte-\nnance patching gang. The field trial was used as both an\nevaluation of the prototype HAV system and to gain an un-\nderstanding of the use of this technology in the field under\nreal conditions. The following sections present our evalua-\ntion methodology and our results.\n5.1 Methodology\nThe field trial deployment was organized in the following\nphases:\nPhase I \u2014 Calibration.\nThe calibration phase of the field trial was conducted on\nthe 10 August 2006. The main aims of the calibration were\nto collect vibration recordings from the hydraulic drill that\nwas used during the field trial and to experiment with the\nappropriate technique for mounting the sensor node on the\ndrill. The vibration recordings collected at this phase were\nused for the proper configuration of the drill sensor node.\nDuring the calibration, a drill was augmented with a sen-\nsor node that could capture acceleration values and transmit\nthem to a nearby laptop over a wireless link (Figure 8). The\ndrill sensor node was mounted on the main body of the drill,\nusing a jubilee clip (Figure 4). A drill operator was asked to\nuse the drill to break different surfaces (concrete, tarmac).\nPhase II \u2014 Pre-Trial.\nThe pre-trial was conducted on the 15-16 August 2006.\nThe main purpose of the pre-trial was to test the operation\nof the system before the actual field trial. During the pre-\ntrial, we:\n\u2022 Tested the operation of the drill sensor node and eval-\nuated its accuracy in detecting when the drill is on or\noff.\n\u2022 Tested the drill \u2013 user NEMO association mechanism\nto see if it functions as expected in the field.\n\u2022 Tested the communication between the NEMO devices\nand the in-vehicle computer.\nDuring the pre-trial, the system was not handed to the\nworkers at all. The method that we used was to have mem-\nbers of our team shadowing the workers and handling the\nNEMO user devices ourselves. This allowed us to observe\nthe system\u2019s operation and identify any unexpected behaviour.\nPhase III \u2014 Field Trial A.\nThe first phase of the field trial was conducted for one\nweek on the 11-15 of September 2006 (see Figure 9). Dur-\ning the first phase of the field trial, all system components\nwere in place. Specifically, the in-vehicle computer and the\nT4 unit were installed in the patching gang\u2019s van. During\nthe field trial, we allowed the workers to operate the system\nthemselves without our involvement. The main aim of the\nfirst phase of the field trial was to conduct a thorough eval-\nuation of the system\u2019s behaviour. For that purpose, we used\nFigure 8: Calibration\nFigure 9: Field Trial\na video camera that recorded all field activities. We were\nthen able to compare the data collected from the NEMO\nsystem against the video footage, and check the correctness\nof the recordings.\nPhase IV \u2014 Field Trial B.\nThe second phase of the field trial was conducted for one\nweek on the 25-28 September 2006. The main purpose of\nthe second phase of the field trial was to experiment with\nalternative techniques for addressing the association prob-\nlem. Specifically, during the second phase of the field trial,\nwe abandoned the association mechanism that required the\nworker to press a button before using the drill. The exper-\niment conducted had as a main aim to identify the worker\nthat is closer to the drill during the time that the drill is\noperating. The assumption was that the proximity could be\nestablished in relation to the quality of the communication\nlink between the drill sensor node and the personal NEMO\ndevices of the workers in the field. Based on that, we setup\nan experiment where we measured the number of lost pack-\nets for all communications between the drill and the NEMO\ndevices and compared the results against the ground truth\nfrom the video footage.\n5.2 Results\n5.2.1 Communication\nEven before deploying the system in the field, we were\naware that the communication of the mobile nodes would be\ngreatly affected by the conditions in the field. Specifically,\nwe were aware that attaching the drill sensor node on a\nhydraulic drill, a heavy metallic object, would influence the\nRF communication. Indeed, during the calibration phase\nand the pre-trial we identified that the communication range\nbetween the drill sensor node and the personal NEMOs was\nsignificantly shorter than the range these units had in the\nlab. While the communication range between the nodes\ncould reach a distance of more than 20m in the lab, the\neffective distance in the field was less than 5m.\nOne of the results that we gathered from the calibration\nphase was that the communication range of the drill sensor\nnode was significantly shorter when the drill was operating.\nIn particular, communication with the drill sensor node was\nat the range of 4-5 m when the drill was idle, and less than\n2m when the drill was vibrating. Although we were aware\nthat the crystal oscillator used by an RF transceiver is sen-\nsitive to physical vibrations [9], this calibration phase gave\nus a clear indication of the extent to which the RF commu-\nnication was affected by vibrations.\nThis observation affected the design of the communica-\ntion protocol that was employed between the field nodes\nduring the field trial. In order to overcome the degradation\nof the communication link during drilling, the communica-\ntion protocol between the drill sensor node and the personal\nNEMO required the exchange of messages only at the end of\na drilling burst (when the drill is not vibrating). Moreover,\nin order to compensate for the low communication quality\nand high loss of packets, we decided to increase redundancy\non the transmitted data. Indeed, the protocol for transmit-\nting vibration data from the drill to the personal device,\ninvolved multiple transmissions of each packet (each packet\nsent three times). Moreover, each packet contained the to-\ntal amount of time the particular worker has been using the\ndrill on that day. This approach reduced the significance\na single lost packet would have on the recorded data: any\ndata contained in a lost packet could be compensated by the\nnext received packet.\n5.2.2 Robustness and Reliability\nThe environment where the HAV system was deployed is\na harsh environment. The tools in particular, are exposed to\nrough treatment and bad weather conditions. Augmenting\nthe drill that would be exposed to such conditions was cer-\ntainly an issue that had to be considered. In order to protect\nthe drill sensor node we used ABS casing, IP-54 certified\n(protection against dust and water), with 3mm thickness.\nThe field trial provided anecdotal evidence that the choice\nwe made for the casing was sufficient for enduring the harsh\nconditions in the field \u2014 we used the same sensor node for\nthe whole two-week period of the field trial and at the end\nof the field trial the sensor node showed no signs of damage.\nThe requirement for robustness was less important for the\nuser NEMO devices. The workers had the tendency to treat\nthem like they would with their mobile phones: placed safely\nin their jacket\u2019s pocket away from any immediate harm.\nHowever, in order to limit the effect that a destroyed user\ndevices would have in the field, we decided to build them as\n\u201ceasily replaceable\u201d commodities. In the deployed system\nthe workers were able to replace any malfunctioning user\ndevice at any time with a new one available in their vehicle.\nThe new device could be personalised using the in-vehicle\ncomputer, allowing the worker to continue their work as be-\nfore. A malfunction in one of the personal NEMOs during\nthe pre-trial allowed us to test the replaceability of the per-\nsonal NEMOs. In that incident, we were able to bring a\nnew personal NEMO in the field, personalise it through the\nin-vehicle computer and continue the field trial normally.\n5.2.3 Power consumption\nDuring the two week field trial, the units deployed could\nmaintain a battery lifetime of approximately one day (28\nhours for the drill unit and 17 hours for the user device).\nThis lifetime was considered sufficient, on the assumption\nthat all field nodes could be recharged at the end of the\nshift. However, our observations during the field trial re-\nvealed that there was a clear asymmetry between the dif-\nferent types of devices in terms of battery lifetime require-\nments. Specifically, the personal NEMO devices were much\neasier to recharge, as the workers could easily leave them\nin a recharger over night. In contrast, recharging the drill\ndevice included the cumbersome task of dismounting and\nremounting the device on the drill. This fact gave us a clear\nindication that in order to reduce the overhead this system\nhad on the workers, it would be imperative to maintain a\nmuch longer battery life for the drill device.\nThe functional characteristics of the drill device offers the\nopportunity to dramatically improve the battery lifetime of\nthe device. Specifically:\n\u2022 The communication requirements for the drill device\nare minimal. The communication interface is only re-\nquired to be on for fractions of seconds at the end of\nevery drilling burst. The rest of the time the wireless\ncommunication can be switched off while the micro-\ncontroller detects the drill\u2019s activity to check whether\nthe drill is being used.\n\u2022 The vibrations of the drill can be used as a source of\npower. Appropriate hardware can be used to harvest\nthe energy produced during drilling to recharge the\ndrill\u2019s battery.\nWe intend to improve the battery lifetime of the drill unit\nby the design of bespoke hardware that will take advantage\nof the mentioned characteristics. Specifically, shutting down\nthe RF module on the drill node can improve significantly\nthe battery lifetime of the device. Preliminary results show\nthat by employing this technique it is possible to achieve a\nbattery life of more than 6 months.\n5.2.4 Accuracy\nEvaluating the accuracy of the HAV system involved the\ncomparison of the data we got from the system against the\nground truth. During the field trial, we established a clear\nindication of the ground truth through a video footage of\n \nDrill \nDrilling starts \nDrilling stops \nWorker A Worker B \nMa Mb \nMb \nMd \n \nMd \n Md \n \nMd \n Md \n Md \n Ma \nMa \nMd : message sent by the drill \nMa : message sent by worker A\u2019s device \nMd : message sent by worker B\u2019s device \n     : lost messages \nFigure 10: Communication protocol for the proxim-\nity detection experiment\nthe activities in the field. We were then able to compare the\nreadings from the system against the video footage.\nDuring the post-trial analysis, we edited the video footage\ncutting out the periods of time that the drill was not active.\nCombining the video clips of individual drilling bursts, we\ngot a single video that showed us the total drilling time\nrequired to work on a single tarmac patch. We were then\nable to compare this time against the total time recorded by\nthe system for the particular tarmac patch.\nThrough the post-trial analysis, we were able to establish\nthat the drilling time recorded by the HAV system had an\naverage error of 3.2% against the actual drilling as recorded\nby the video footage. Furthermore we established that the\nerror was proportional to the total number of drilling bursts\ninvolved in the patching of a single patch, and inversely pro-\nportional to the duration of the drilling bursts. This meant\nthat working on a tarmac patch with a small number of\ndrilling bursts of longer duration would result on a smaller\nerror than a large number of drilling bursts of shorter dura-\ntion. Based on these observations, we believe that the error\nis a constant value for each drilling burst and we have been\nable to modify the drilling time measurement in order to\nadd a compensation for the measurement error.\n5.2.5 Proximity Detection\nDuring the second week of the field trial, we conducted\nan experiment trying to infer the operator of the drill based\non their proximity to the drill sensor node. The approach\nused was based on the quality of the communication between\nthe drill sensor node and the user NEMO devices of the\nworkers in the field. The quality of the communication is\nestimated according to the number of lost packets on each\ncommunication link. The proximity detection is based on\nthe assumption that the communication quality is relative\nto the distance between two wireless nodes.\nSetup of the Experiment.\nIn this experiment both the drill sensor node and the user\ndevices were modified in order to record the number of mes-\nPercentage of successful hand-shakes over attempted \nhand-shakes\n0.00%\n20.00%\n40.00%\n60.00%\n80.00%\n100.00%\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nWorker A Worker B\nAttempts\n \nFigure 11: Percentage of successful hand-shakes\nover the period of one tarmac patch\nDrill On\/Off\n0\n1.2\n11:17:00 11:17:30 11:18:00 11:18:30 11:19:00 11:19:30 11:20:00 11:20:30 11:21:00 11:21:30 11:22:00 11:22:30 11:23:00 11:23:30 11:24:00 11:24:30 11:25:00 11:25:30 11:26:00 11:26:30\nWorker B\n0\n3.5\n11:17:00 11:17:30 11:18:00 11:18:30 11:19:00 11:19:30 11:20:00 11:20:30 11:21:00 11:21:30 11:22:00 11:22:30 11:23:00 11:23:30 11:24:00 11:24:30 11:25:00 11:25:30 11:26:00 11:26:30\nWorker A\n0\n3.5\n11:17:00 11:17:30 11:18:00 11:18:30 11:19:00 11:19:30 11:20:00 11:20:30 11:21:00 11:21:30 11:22:00 11:22:30 11:23:00 11:23:30 11:24:00 11:24:30 11:25:00 11:25:30 11:26:00 11:26:30\nFigure 12: Comparing the number of received packets against the video footage. The blue lines represent\nthe received packets from the worker operating the drill while the white lines represent the packets from the\nother worker. The lower graph shows the drill\u2019s activity (on\/off).\nsages exchanged between the nodes during operation. More-\nover, a protocol was implemented that allowed the sporadic\n\u201chand-shake\u201d between the drill sensor node and all close-by\nuser NEMO devices.\nDuring the calibration phase of the field trial, we estab-\nlished a significant difference in communication quality be-\ntween the drill\u2019s idle and operating time. In order to get\na valid result from this experiment, we refined the protocol\nto avoid any communication during drilling time. Specifi-\ncally, when the drill is operating the sensor node monitors\nthe drill\u2019s activity and awaits the time that the drill stops.\nWhen the drill stops the sensor node broadcasts a message\nwith the total drilling time (repeated 3 times). On receipt of\nthat message, all user devices reply back with an acknowl-\nedgement (Figure 13). The drill sensor node records the\nnumber of replies it received from each user NEMO device.\nThe aim of the experiment is to record the number of suc-\ncessful \u201chand-shakes\u201d between the drill and the user devices,\nover the period of drilling one tarmac patch. The assump-\ntion is that the worker using the drill does not change until\nthe whole patch is finished. By analysing the recorded data,\nwe want to check the feasibility of this approach as a possible\ntechnique for proximity detection\nResults.\nThe experiment was conducted for four consecutive days\nduring Phase IV. During this time, there were two workers in\nthe field equipped with a user NEMO device. The data that\nwe collected included time stamped records of the successful\nhandshakes exchanged between the drill and the two workers\nin the field. During this time, we used a video camera that\nrecorded all activities in the field. We were then able to\ncompare our measurements with what was happening in the\nfield.\nThe first step in the post-trial analysis was to compare the\nnumber of successful handshakes from the two workers. As\nshown in Figure 11, there was a clear difference between the\nworker operating the drill (worker A) and the other worker\n(worker B). Specifically, in the results shown in the figure,\nupon completion of a tarmac patch, worker A had in aver-\nage 32.8% successful hand-shakes against 3.9% for worker\nB. In general, for all the tarmac patches for which we ran\nthe experiment the worker operating the drill had a rate of\nsuccessful handshakes varying in the range of 26% - 40%\nwhile the rate for the other worker varied in the range of 0%\n- 5%.\nThe next step in the analysis was to align the timestamped\nrecords of successful handshakes against the video footage\n(Figure 12). Through this, it became clear that there was\na direct relation between the quality of communication and\nthe workers proximity to the drill, as well as their orienta-\ntion towards the drill. Indeed, the number of lost packets\nbetween the drill and the personal NEMOs increased signif-\nicantly when the workers were more than 2m further from\nthe drill. Similarly, when the workers were not facing the\ndrill and therefore their body was obstructing the commu-\nnication between their personal NEMO and the drill sensor\nnode, the communication deteriorated.\nThese results showed that the number of lost packets is a\nvalid indicator for identifying the drill operator. Through-\nout the four days of experiments, it would have been possible\nto identify successfully the person operating the drill using\nas an indication the number of successful handshakes ex-\nchanged with the drill sensor node. Based on these results,\na very simple algorithm for establishing association using\nproximity, would involve the aggregation of the number of\nsuccessful handshakes over the period of drilling a single\npatch. This way the worker with more successful handshakes\nwould be identified as the operator of the drill.\n5.2.6 Usability Issues\nThe second week of the field trial gave us the opportunity\nto get a direct feed-back on the form factor of the personal\nNEMO device. To provide a point of comparison, we re-\nplaced the personal NEMO device with a wrist mounted\ndevice for one day (Figure 13). This allowed us to compare\nFigure 13: A worker wearing a wrist mounted\nNEMO device\nthe workers\u2019 response to the two different unit types. The\nworkers showed a strong preference for the original NEMO\ndevice. They found it non intrusive as they could easily\nput it in their pocket. Moreover, the LCD display allowed\nthem to get immediate feedback on the levels of their HAV\nexposure.\nWhen the workers were asked to use a wrist mounted unit,\nthey showed an immediate negative attitude towards the de-\nvice. They complained that having something on their wrist\nfelt more like a surveillance device than a H&S support sys-\ntem. Their general comment was that the wrist mounted\ndevice \u201cfelt awkward\u201d and it gave them a feeling that they\nare being monitored on whatever they do. This attitude did\nnot come as a surprise to us. Through conversations with\nthe workers we gathered indications that an automated H&S\nmonitoring system is perceived by the workers as a special\npurpose surveillance system. The wrist mounted unit em-\nphasised this perception as it increased their sense of being\n\u201ctagged\u201d.\nOur observations during the field trial gave us an indica-\ntion of significant factors that can affect the acceptability of\nthe end system. Such factors are:\n\u2022 Familiarity of the form factor: the original user device\nhad a form factor similar to a common mobile phone.\nThis allowed the workers to relate better with the par-\nticular device.\n\u2022 Lack of restrictions: the wrist mounted unit required\nto be worn on a particular way. On the contrary, the\noriginal user device could be placed anywhere they\nfound convenient.\n\u2022 Display: in order to maintain a smaller footprint, the\nwrist mounted unit did not have a display. This limits\nthe workers\u2019 awareness of the functionality of the de-\nvice. Moreover, it raised fears that it was doing more\nthan just recording HAV exposure.\nThese results justified our initial approach of not designing a\nsystem that required any hand mounted devices but rather\nfollow a design where personal devices can be handled in a\nmore liberal manner. It is our belief that this approach can\nsignificantly improve the acceptability of the HAV system.\n6. RELATED WORK\nUbiquitous computing in industrial workspaces has been\nmostly related to asset management. For example, indus-\ntrial artefacts have been augmented at very low cost with\nRFID tags [14] to support their unique identification and\ntracking in an appropriately instrumented environment. Our\napproach however, is to augment artefacts with sensing,\ncomputing and networking capabilities, allowing applica-\ntions that are fully embedded within the artefacts with min-\nimal infrastructural support. This approach has been em-\nployed in the past for monitoring storage regulations in a\nchemical plant [19]. In the work presented in this paper, we\nemploy this approach in the context of work activities, in-\nvolving wearable user devices along side augmented physical\nobjects. This approach introduces new challenges (e.g. the\nassociation problem, usability issues) and new opportunities\nto resolve such issues through cooperating mobile nodes.\nOur general approach is related to other ubiquitous com-\nputing research concerned with instrumentation of the world.\nMost of these systems and infrastructures are based on in-\nstrumentations of controlled environments such as offices [1,\n4] or homes [20].\nPrevious research has also considered the role of artefacts\nin connection to location and users. The Cooltown project\n[12] investigates the digital presence of people, places and\nthings. The SPECs project [13] proposes a platform for\nactivity sensing using peer\u2013to\u2013peer proximity. More closely\nrelated to our work are systems directly concerned with arte-\nfacts and their situation, for example tracking of movable\nassets and innovative business services [8, 14].\nIn the domain of HAV, there are many commercially avail-\nable equipment for measuring Hand-Arm vibrations [7, 3,\n18]. These are highly accurate, but rather bulky and ex-\npensive devices, not targeted for continuous every day use.\nTheir purpose is to allow field engineers to test their tools\nand measure their vibration magnitude. These measure-\nments are then used in order for the company to specify\nregulations about the time these tools should be operated.\nThe HAV monitoring system presented in this paper, serves\na different purpose. The aim of this system is to monitor\nthe compliance with the regulations specified on a daily basis\nwith minimum effort or obstruction from the workers.\nThere is related ubiquitous computing research concerned\nwith assessment of critical situations, such as fire fighting\n[11, 6], avalanche rescue [17] and guidance through danger-\nous terrain [16].\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have described our experiences of design-\ning and deploying the NEMO Hand Arm Vibration (HAV)\nmonitoring system. The system offers an integrated archi-\ntecture for capturing HAV exposure data in the field, pro-\nviding feedback about exposure levels both in the field and\nas input to a back-end database, and the system has been\nthe subject of a successful two week field trial. Our major\nresult is that we have been able to show that a functioning\nHAV H&S compliance system can be constructed using an\napproach based on augmented artefacts. We believe this ap-\nproach has significant potential for other H&S domains and\nour future aim is to evaluate the reusability of the NEMO\nnodes as building blocks for the development of new H&S\napplications. In addition to this major result, we have also\nbeen able to report on a wide range of experiences we gained\nduring this design and deployment exercise, which we believe\nwill be of value to researchers planning to work in the area\nof mobile H&S systems.\n8.
