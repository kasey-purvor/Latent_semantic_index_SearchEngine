Although\nthere is little scope to produce generalizable results in the short term, the difficulty of doing so in\nexperimental studies suggests that this objective is difficult to achieve in educational research. A more\nrealistic, longer-term aim is the development of grounded theory based on common findings from\nindividual cases.\nExperiments that failed\nScientific, experimental methodology was previously considered to be the only acceptable\napproach to educational research. Two important principles of experimental design are:\n\u2022 to balance individual differences within study populations and so achieve generalizable\nresults,\nand\n\u2022 to attempt to isolate the effects of a single resource for evaluation purposes.\nProblems with this approach were reported in the literature of the 1970s (Elton and\nLaurillard, 1979; MacDonald and Jenkins, 1979) when the influence on learning of\n40\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nindividual and contextual factors was recognized. Similar issues emerged during the 1980s\nand early 1990s, (Bates, 1981; Spencer, 1991) when the inability to identify which single or\ncombined factors supported learning became a recurrent problem. It was clear that prior\nknowledge, approaches to learning, provision of appropriate scaffolding, complementary\ncombinations of resources and various contextual factors all influenced the quality of\nlearning outcomes. It was concluded that evaluations must be designed to account for\nthese factors, rather than to balance or disregard them as was previously the norm\n(Kemmis, 1987, Gunn, 1995).\nAnother problem stemmed from the belief that single studies involving large sample sizes\nwere necessary to produce meaningful results. The rather indiscriminate choice of study\npopulations required to produce the requisite numbers frequently resulted in low\nmotivation and levels of perceived relevance of evaluation tasks to personal and\neducational goals (Draper et al, 1996; Gunn, 1996). This suggested that the true potential\nfor learning with CAL could not be reliably assessed unless its use formed an integral part\nof a course, and evaluations involved only the students on that course. It was thus\nconcluded that the more specific aspects of CAL evaluation could not be served by a\ngeneral and inflexible research methodology originally designed to measure the uniform\nand largely predictable behaviour of organisms in the physical sciences.\nThe basis of an alternative methodology\nIn the context of the work reported here, development of a suitable methodology began\nwith a review of educational research literature. Critical theory (Carr and Kemmis, 1986),\ncritical ethnography (Angus, 1986) and qualitative methodology (Denzin and Lincoln,\n1994) were adopted as the basis for grounded development of the Situated Evaluation of\nCAL (SECAL) framework. The stages of development are described elsewhere (Gunn,\n1995; 1996). Within the situated approach, the standard range of objective and subjective\nresearch methods are used, as appropriate, for evaluation study design, i.e. observation,\nfield notes, log data, interview, questionnaires, outcomes analysis, results comparisons,\nattitude surveys, expert review, and discussion groups.\nThe SECAL approach is opportunistic in recognizing that situation-specific factors such\nas logistical and ethical constraints will determine what subset of qualitative methods is\navailable, and of these methods, which are the most appropriate in a particular case. The\ncase-study method described by Yin (1991) is the basis for study design, and from this\ncomes the longer-term objective to develop grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967).\nAction research (Zuber-Skerrit, 1990) describes the preferred, collaborative approach\ninvolving all interested parties in CAL development and integration initiatives. It also\ndefines the action-reflection-modification cycle that models the dynamic process of\neducational change.\nThe concept of situated evaluation\nThe concept of situation is described in relation to knowledge and learning by Brown et al\n(1989): 'Knowledge is situated being in part a product of the activity, context and culture\nin which it is developed and used'. Although there is some debate about the precise nature\n41\nCathy Gunn CAL evaluation: future directions\nof situatedness, if the concept is accepted at all, evaluation should not assess whether\nCAL alone supports learning or enhances its effectiveness. It must examine the effects of\nparticular resource combinations within specific learning contexts. It was never\nconsidered necessary to evaluate the impact of a book or lecture in isolation, so the\njustification for doing so with CAL is hard to see.\nThe range of potential influences on learning is broad, and includes factors which are\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic to any particular study resource. To accommodate all\npossibilities, SECAL includes the concepts of evaluation in context and evaluation of\ncontext. Evaluation in context refers to study of the primary effects of using CAL\nprograms with other resources and forms of support. The proper integration of CAL into\ncourses is crucial. Evaluation of context examines factors related indirectly to a CAL\nprogram or the immediate learning environment, but ones which can still influence\nintegration at an institutional level, and so impact on learning outcomes. Factors related\nto levels of institutional support for acquisition, development and use of CAL fall into\nthis latter category. There is also a dynamic aspect of SECAL which supports\nrecommendation and implementation of beneficial changes to learning environments.\nAuthenticity and context\nThe importance of contextual influences implies that authenticity in study design should\nbe a non-negotiable factor. Evaluation is consequently limited in scope and frequency by\nthe number of target users and available opportunities for the effects of CAL to be\nevaluated as a fully integrated part of a course. Although these limitations may appear to\nbe rather restrictive, the comprehensive and theoretically supported SECAL framework\nhas been successfully applied in very different circumstances and has produced relevant\nand meaningful results. The experimental objectives of generalizable results and theory\ngeneration are not ruled out - they just take longer to achieve. In view of the strict\nrelevance of outcomes, the compromise is worthwhile.\nExtrinsic influences\nThe institutional context Tne w lining cnviiuument\nIntrinsic factors\nFunctionality Learning objectives\nMotivational factots Hardware \/software issues\ny^\u2014Objective\nMeasuring\neflecrhrenessof \\\nf mri c\n\\ ^ CAL\nV leaminfwith I\n1\nDesign objective* Design quality issues\nClassroom culture Integration issues\nFigure \/: SECAL - a framework for situated evaluation of CAL\n42\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nSECAL element Case-specific details\nStatement of evaluation objectives\nLearning objectives\nHardware!software issues\nEffective use of technology\nDesign objectives\nDesign quality, functionality and\nother usability issues\nInstructional strategy\nLearner model\nContent and presentation\nLearning support\nMotivational factors\nClassroom culture\nInstitutional context\nTo assess the impact on learning of using CAL to replace some practical\nlaboratory work:\n\u2022 examine the case for investment in more workstations and software\nlicences;\n\u2022 'explore the potential for development of stand-alone CAL tutorial\nexercises;\n\u2022 identify areas for further investigation through qualitative, quantitative\nor longitudinal studies.\nStudents should gain a basis for understanding the biomechanics of move-\nment and the nature and avoidance of sports injuries. The evaluation tasks\nmeasured learning by the ability to locate, identify and describe inter-\nconnections of various structures.\nThe product was bought in and so offered no scope for modification. The\nhardware specification complied with what was already available within the\ndepartment. However, licence limitations required it to run across a\nnetwork, and speed, functionality, etc. had not been tested under these\nconditions.\nThe program presents clear and logically constructed representations of the\nsystems, structures and layers of the human body. Views can be rotated,\nexpanded and dissected in layers. A fair impression of a three-dimensional\nstructure is given by something that is in fact two-dimensional. Access to\nwritten and spoken versions of the entire, complex terminology is provided.\nThese were not measured because the product was bought in. The\ndevelopers' stated objectives were a useful product for all aspects of medical\neducation.\nThe program was of accepted high quality, scored well on usability factors,\nsuccessfully engaged interest, and allowed tasks to be completed in a logical\nmanner.\nThere was no built-in instructional strategy so this was provided by the\ncontext of use, i.e.\n\u2022 tailoring the work to an appropriate level of difficulty;\n\u2022 providing 'scaffolding' for novice computer users and those less\nconfident with the subject;\n\u2022 promoting peer support and the benefits of collaborative learning;\n\u2022 using a constructivist approach to learning with CAL.\nThe general learner model was defined by the product developers. It was\nfurther specified by contextual factors.\nThe content of the program was comprehensive, and presentation was of\ngood, logical standard. Presentation of the program itself was defined by\nsituational factors.\nSome support was provided by features of the program. Additional sources\nwere from situational factors such as the task, situation within the course,\nlecture notes, diagrams and the presence of the lecturer.\n\u2022 Making learning goals explicitly relevant to the whole course and to\nassessment requirements;\n\u2022 the attractive appearance of the program;\n\u2022 presenting the task as a series of challenges and providing feedback.\nThe group had little previous experience of independent learning, so gradual\nintroduction in a small-group setting was favoured; attention was paid to\ndesign of a non-threatening situation for novice users.\nThere existed no clear institution strategy related to developments in CAL\nand support was inconsistent\nFigure 2: The SECAL framework for evaluating a CAL program in a course on human anatomy\n43\nCathy Gunn CAL evaluation: future directions\nSECAL description\nFigure 1 shows the elements included in the SECAL framework, the relative importance\nof each being determined by the evaluation objectives and the interests being served. It is\na simple matter to customize the framework by weighting each element according to its\nrelevance in a particular case.\nIntegration issues\nThe elements of the SECAL framework all depend to some extent on CAL being fully\nintegrated into courses. There have been cases where well designed, educationally sound\nand accessible CAL fails to achieve the success its potential implies. This is often\nattributable to poor integration strategies, either at institutional or classroom level.\nWhere CAL is simply one available option rather than a compulsory part of a course,\ntake-up rates are frequently poor because there is no compelling reason for students to\nadopt the new study habits involved. Where staff are not committed to technological\nadvances, little encouragement may be passed on to students. Equally, where institutions\ndo not actively encourage staff to use innovative methods little incentive or support may\nbe available to those who wish to do so. At a broader contextual level, there may be\nsocial, political and economic pressures which shape institutional policy on matters of\ntechnological change in a positive or negative way. Such influences may seem a long way\nfrom the 1990s classroom where students are required to use new technologies as aids to\nlearning and communication, but the measurable effects clearly can extend across this\nentire range.\nApplying SECAL\nThe scenario in Figure 2 presents an example of the SECAL framework applied to the\nevaluation of a newly introduced CAL program in a course on human anatomy. The\ndata-collection methods included independent observation, field notes, analysis of task\nperformance, expert opinion and group discussions. A full case study report has been\npublished by Gunn (1996).\nConclusions\nThe very brief description in Figure 2 of the structure and application of an evaluation\nframework designed to meet the current requirements of CAL researchers can be\nsummarized in four points:\n\u2022 generation of a detailed description of the evaluation questions to be answered , i.e. the\nquality of learning outcomes and the means of effective measurement;\n\u2022 assessment of the evaluation opportunities presented and methods available in the\nfocus situation;\n\u2022 consideration of findings in relation to the influence of prevailing situational factors;\n\u2022 reflection on the evaluation process and study findings with a view to future actions.\n44\nALT-J Volume 5 Number I\nCAL is not used alone, and so should not be evaluated in isolation. Attempts to do this\nhave frequently been related to measures of cost-effectiveness or comparative studies.\nWithout minimizing the importance of these issues, they do not address the critical\nquestions about quality of learning and the integration of CAL.\nTo end on an optimistic note, it was once said of the Model T Ford that if proof had been\nneeded that the motor car provided an economical form of mass transport, it would never\nhave passed the novelty stage. What mattered in the end was that it increased user-choice\nand provided an enjoyable, effective way to travel, so the economics of production\nbecame a priority and eventually made it affordable to the masses. Cost considerations of\nCAL involve a rather separate and complex set of issues, and no attempt is made to\ninclude them in the SECAL framework. The primary focus is on how CAL technology\nmight enhance the quality of learning outcomes in the short term, and in the longer term\nhelp to drive major educational and social change.\nReferences\nAngus, L.
