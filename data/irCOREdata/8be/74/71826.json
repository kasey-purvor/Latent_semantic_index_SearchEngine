A carbon cycle model (forced by \nlarge values of Southern Ocean dust flux) indicates productivity changes during \npast glacial times could have reduced atmospheric CO2 by ~40ppm 5. However, \nSouthern Ocean dust flux is very low at present and was increased, but still low, \nduring past glaciations. Thus, as for the equatorial Pacific 1, 6, 7, distally-supplied, \nupwelled iron may be more significant than local dust-borne iron. Hence, \nNorthern, not Southern, hemisphere dust may drive Southern Ocean \nproductivity8,9. Here, we examine the flux and timing of N. Atlantic dust inputs in \nrelation to the Vostok climate record. For the penultimate glaciation, two N. \nAtlantic dust peaks occurred. At 155 ka, the Atlantic dust flux was 2500x that at \nVostok10, but declined well before the onset of the Vostok CO2 rise. The second \n 2\ndust peak, at 130ka, substantially post-dated the CO2 rise. Thus, low Southern \nOcean dust fluxes, and this mismatch between N. hemisphere dust peaks and \nSouthern Ocean climate change, appear not to support the suggested role of dust-\nmediated iron fertilisation in the Southern Ocean at Termination II. \nThe Southern Ocean is a \u2018high nutrient, low chlorophyll\u2019 (HNLC) region; \nphosphate and nitrate concentrations are high at the ocean surface yet its productivity is \nlow. Recent experiments show that artificial additions of iron to ocean patches \nsignificantly enhance primary productivity 4, with consequent drawdown of surface \nwater f(CO2) - the water becoming a sink for atmospheric CO2. Hence, the strength of \nthe \u2018biological pump\u2019 may influence atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The Vostok \n(Antarctic) ice core record shows that towards the end of past glacial stages, the \nSouthern Ocean region warmed and atmospheric CO2 levels rose several thousand years \nbefore the N. hemisphere ice sheets melted.  Thus, this region may be critical for \ncausing and\/or amplifying climate change.  A major control on iron supply to HNLC \nregions is thought to be the flux of terrestrial dust 5, 11. To drive a model of the ocean-\natmosphere carbon cycle, which predicts up to ~40 ppm CO2 drawdown in response to \nincreased Southern Ocean dust flux during glacial stages, Watson et al. 5 used a \nmodelled estimate of modern dust flux, of 14 mg.cm-2.kyr-1 (a value which Mahowald et \nal. 12 themselves considered over-predicted) and an LGM value of 345 mg.cm-2.kyr-1. \nData on the present-day dust flux to the Southern Ocean, whilst sparse, are mutually \nconsistent 13, 14, 15 and indicate much lower fluxes of 0.1 \u2013 1 mg.cm-2.kyr-1. At glacial \ntimes, increased aridity and\/or wind strength could have contributed higher Southern \nOcean dust fluxes and thus to lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations.  The Vostok \nrecord indeed shows peak dust flux during glaciations, when atmospheric CO2 was \ndepressed by ~80 ppm16.  However, geological data indicate these increased glacial dust \nfluxes were small, and negligible compared with detrital (ie non-aeolian) sediment \naccumulation rates in the Southern Ocean.  The Southern Ocean exhibits sedimentation \n 3\nrates far greater than the atmospheric flux, due to bottom water-transport of detritus.  \nFor Scotia Sea sediments, for example, the aeolian contribution from the S. American \nloess regions (identified isotopically as the principal source of Vostok\u2019s dust17) is below \nthe level of detection, even during glacial periods18.  Similarly, in cores from the SE \nIndian Ocean to the Antarctic continental slope, aeolian particles account for <10 % of \nthe clay minerals present10. An aeolian flux 600 x that actually recorded in the Vostok \nice core (~ 2 mg.cm-2.kyr-1) would be required to explain the lithogenic flux at these \nsites during glacial times 10.  Thus, interpretation of lithogenic accumulation rates as a \nproxy for Southern Ocean dust flux 19 appears invalid. Similarly, dust concentration \nchanges in the Vostok ice core cannot be used to constrain model simulations of past \ndust fluxes5 because snow accumulation rates were lower during glacial stages; dust flux \nchanges were hence much smaller than concentration changes12.    \nGiven the low dust fluxes to this region, iron supply from upwelling water \nappears a more significant source, by at least an order of magnitude 5, 8, 9. Similar \nupwelled iron supply has been identified for the HNLC region of the equatorial Pacific \n6, 7. Thus, for the Southern Ocean, upwelled iron and resultant productivity may reflect \ndistal (ie N. hemisphere), rather than S. hemisphere, dust inputs. It has been suggested \nthat iron from the peri-Saharan region (the largest dust source in the world) may be \ntransported in southward flow of the N. Atlantic intermediate\/deep water to the \ncircumpolar region, on a timescale of ~ 100 years 8. This hypothesis suggests that the \npattern of N., rather than S., hemisphere dust flux may match more closely the pattern \nand timing of CO2 variations recorded by the Vostok ice core.  \nHere, we test this hypothesis by high-resolution oxygen isotope, magnetic and \nelemental analysis of a deep-sea sediment record, Core 82PCS01, from the abyssal plain \nnortheast of the Azores.  Sedimentation at this site has been continuous and undisturbed \nfrom oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 8 to the present day 20. The core site lies above the \n 4\nlysocline, precluding carbonate dissolution, and underlies the present-day northern \nmargin of the Bermuda-Azores high pressure system, around which African dust can be \ntransported northwards in the summer 21, cover photo. Upon sinking, possible complexation \nor dissolution22, iron may become entrained within southward-flowing Atlantic \nintermediate\/deep water. We obtained an age model for the core via oxygen isotope \nanalysis of the planktonic foraminifer, Globorotalia bulloides, correlating the data with \nMartinson et al.\u2019s 23 chronostratigraphy.  We measured the magnetic remanence \nacquired at high applied magnetic fields (the HIRM) of the sediments, as a proxy for \niron. Additional analyses on subsets of samples included carbonate content, elemental \niron and dry bulk density. From these data, we calculated sedimentation rates and fluxes \nof iron and dust.\nFigure 1 shows the oxygen isotope data for Core 82PCS01, with the chronology \nbased on tie points to the high-resolution chronostratigraphy of Martinson et al.23.  Also \nshown in Figure 1 is the Vostok \u03b418O (in air) record16. Both these chronologies agree \nstrongly (to within 1 kyr) with that newly derived by tuning of the benthic marine \u03b418O \nrecord (and the Vostok air \u03b418O record) to tilt and precession cycles24.  Figure 2 shows \nthe \u03b418O and HIRM data for Core 82PCS01, for the time interval 100 -180 ka. For \ncomparison, terrigenous % data are also shown for another, more southerly core in the \neastern Atlantic.  Core 82PCS01 appears to record a representative (but much higher \nresolution) signal of dust input over at least a regional scale. For glacial stage 6, Core \n82PCS01 displays two peaks in HIRM, at ~ 130 ka and ~155 ka.  For the succeeding \ninterglacial stage, from ~125 to 100 ka, HIRM values are low and less variable.  These \nhigh-resolution data amplify those reported 25 for gravity cores in this area. Goethite, a \nsignificant component of soils within the semi-arid zone, has been identified as the \nmajor contributor to the HIRM of these sediments 25.  Given the saturation remanence \nof goethite26 (~0.05 A.m2. kg-1), our carbonate-free HIRM values (7 \u2013 44x \n 5\n10-4 A.m2.kg-1) indicate goethite concentrations in the dust component of the sediment \nof 1.4 - 8.8 %. HIRM values (for every sample) and independently-determined iron \n(wt%, determined for a subset of samples) are directly and strongly correlated (R2 = \n0.83). Thus, rapid, non-destructive HIRM measurements appear to be a robust proxy for \naeolian, elemental iron concentrations in these N. Atlantic sediments.  It should be noted \nthat our N. Atlantic record documents particulate iron deposition through time, rather \nthan dissolved iron.  The relationship between iron-bearing dust flux and dissolved iron \nconcentrations in deep water is presently not known, but dust-sourced increases in deep \nwater iron would imply increased concentrations of organic ligands capable of \ncomplexing the iron to maintain solubility22.   \nFigure 3a shows the calculated dust fluxes for Core 82PCS01, for the period \nspanning glacial stage 6, Termination II and interglacial stage 5.  Dust flux was 3 - 5 x \nhigher during two intervals, ~ 155 ka (~5 g.cm-2.kyr-1) and ~ 130 ka (~3 g.cm-2.kyr-1). \nDuring interglacial stage 5 (from ~130 ka on), dust fluxes decreased rapidly before \nsteadying at ~ 1 g.cm-2.kyr-1.  For comparison, estimates of modern fluxes 12 for the NE \nequatorial Atlantic mostly range from 0.2 - 3 g.cm-2.kyr-1, with (depending on latitude) a \none- to four-fold increase in dust flux at the Last Glacial Maximum. \nThe oxygen isotope records from 82PCS01 and Vostok are in excellent \nagreement (Figure 1). At Termination II, the rise in \u03b418O (in air) at Vostok lags the N. \nAtlantic rise by ~2 ka, this delay attributable to the Dole effect 24. The major, five-fold \nincrease in our N. Atlantic dust flux is thus virtually synchronous with peak A in the \nVostok dust concentration record (figure 3c). However, at its peak, the Vostok dust flux \nis ~2500 x smaller than our N. Atlantic flux (~2 mg.cm-2.kyr-1 compared with 5 g.cm-2 \nkyr-1).  In global climate terms, this major rise and fall in N. Atlantic dust (and iron) flux \noccurred entirely within OIS 6, with little apparent variation in either atmospheric CO2 \nor oxygen isotope values (figure 3d-g). N. Atlantic dust flux then declined, substantially \n 6\nearlier (by ~7000 years) than the onset of the CO2 rise at Vostok. The second dust flux \nevent in Core 82PCS01, centred on ~130 ka, may have provided a significant, later \nsupply of iron to drive Southern Ocean productivity, when S. hemisphere dust flux had \ndiminished to near-zero.  However, as shown in figure 3, this subsidiary peak in dust \nflux significantly post-dates (by ~7000 years) the onset of the CO2 rise. Rather than \nbeing associated with drawdown of CO2 and maintenance of glacial conditions, the peak \nof this later event coincides with a marked, ~1 o\/oo shift in oxygen isotope values (fig. \n3d), indicating either warming N. Atlantic sea surface temperatures 27 and\/or melting of \nthe N. hemisphere ice sheets. \nThus, whilst fluxes of N. hemisphere dust may constitute an alternative, higher-\nmagnitude supply of iron to the Southern Ocean, they seem to bear no causal \nrelationship with either changes in Southern Ocean temperature or atmospheric CO2, as \nrecorded at Vostok around Termination II.   These data - the evidence of very low dust \nfluxes to the Southern Ocean, and the mismatch of timing between the N. hemisphere \nflux peaks and Southern Ocean climate change - thus do not appear to support the \nsuggested role of dust-mediated iron fertilisation in the Southern Ocean at and around \nthe Termination II boundary.   \nMethods. \nFrom each 1 cm sample (sieved at 63 \u00b5m), 10-20 adult specimens (0.2 to 0.5 mg) of the \nplanktonic foraminifer, Globorotalia bulloides, were picked for oxygen isotope \nanalysis. These were reacted off-line with 102% orthophosphoric acid at 25 oC for 12 \nhours, the evolved CO2 dried by passing through a cold trap at \u201390 oC and cryodistilled \ninto gas sample tubes.  Isotopic analyses were performed on a VG SIRA series II dual \ninlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Oxygen isotopic compositions, with respect to the \nVienna PDB (VPDB) standard, are accurate and precise to better than < 0.1\u2030.  \nAnalyses of 0.2 mg aliquots of the internal lab. standard run at random with the \n 7\nforaminiferal samples, at an average frequency of 1 in 4 samples, have a precision (1\u03c3n-\n1) of \u00b10.06\u2030 (n = 30). For magnetic analysis, the < 63 \u00b5m fraction of each sample was \ndried and packed into 10 cc plastic cylinders. Magnetic fields were generated using a \npulse magnetiser (up to 100 mT) and electromagnet (up to 1 T); magnetic remanences \nmeasured using a fluxgate magnetometer (sensitivity ~10-7 A m2). Carbonate content \nwas obtained by gasometry, elemental iron content by x ray fluorescence of sample \nbeads, fused with sodium lithoborate. \nTo calculate iron flux, the following equation was used: \niron flux = SR (DBD) p \nwhere flux is in units of g.cm-2.kyr-1 and SR = sedimentation rate (cm kyr-1), DBD = dry \nbulk density (g.cm-3) and p is the weight fraction of iron. \nFrom the age model, a sedimentation rate was calculated for each sediment depth.  \nHeavy sampling meant it was not possible to obtain a DBD value for every sample \ndepth. Density was estimated28 from the relationship between CO3 content and the \nmeasured DBD of a subset of samples (14) spanning the CO3 range.  For values of p, \niron(wt fraction) is estimated for every sample from the HIRM\/elemental iron \ncorrelation. Dust flux was calculated from the iron (wt fraction), assuming an average \niron abundance in mineral aerosols of 3.5 % 29. \n1. Loubere, P.
