This\nprocess is called adipose involution, as the thymus is invaded by\nadipose tissue [1]. Due to decrease in thymic epithelial tissue mass,\nthe thymus can no longer support the same output of T-cell\nproduction [2]. Therefore peripheral blood T lymphocyte\ncomposition exhibits the dominance of memory T lymphocytes\nresulting in impaired responses towards novel, particularly viral\ninfections [3,4,5]. Since the thymic epithelium has a key role in\ndeleting auto-reactive T-cell clones, functional impairment\nincreases the chances of developing auto-immune disease [6]. If\nwe were able to slow down or even stop the loss of thymic\nepithelium the elderly would have a better chance to address late-\nonset autoimmune diseases and viral infections. However, despite\nstudies of thymic senescence, the molecular mechanism of thymic\naging remains elusive.\nSignaling pathways of thymic epithelial cell development\nand maintenance\nUnderstanding signaling mechanisms that regulate tissue\ndevelopment and maintenance of thymic epithelial cells might\nreveal the process of adipose involution. Certainly, maintenance\nand functional integrity of the thymic stroma requires stimuli\nthrough Notch, BMP, and Wnt signaling pathways [7,8,9,10,11].\nUndoubtedly, the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins is one of\nthe best analyzed among the required ligands [12]. Most members\nof the nineteen known Wnt glycoproteins have been implicated in\nboth the development of embryonic thymus and the maintenance\nof adult thymic epithelium [13]. In the thymus, Wnt ligands\noriginate primarily from thymic epithelial cells and activate a\nhighly complex signaling network via ten G-protein dependent\nreceptors called Frizzleds (Fz), and their co-receptors of low-\ndensity lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5\/6 called LRP5\/6\n[14,15]. The actual constellation of ligands, receptors, co-receptors\nand further regulatory molecules define Wnt-mediated effects.\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10701\nRecent studies have highlighted Wnt4 as responsible for the direct\nup-regulation of FoxN1, a key transcription factor responsible for\nthe differentiation of thymic epithelial cells and the subsequent\nmaintenance of thymic epithelial identity [13]. Interestingly, the\nWnt\/b-catenin pathway is known to efficiently block the adipocyte\ndifferentiation program in mesenchymal elements like fibroblasts\n[16,17,18,19].\nTrans-differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes\nStudies with fibroblast cells have also revealed that fibroblast to\npre-adipocyte transformation is strongly connected to LAP2a, the\nmember of the LAP2 protein family [17]. To date there are 7\nclassified intranuclear LAP2 polypeptides marked by the Greek\nalphabet. They are all splice variants of the same LAP2 gene\npreviously called thymopoietin. While most splice variants\nassociate with the nuclear envelope, LAP2a is involved in several\nnucleoplasmic activities including cell-cycle control and differen-\ntiation [20,21]. LAP2a is synthesized in the cytoplasm and is then\ntransported into the nucleus by a PKC-dependent mechanism\n[22]. The mere over-expression of LAP2a in fibroblasts is known\nto directly up-regulate PPARc expression, an acknowledged\nmarker and key transcription factor of pre-adipocyte differentia-\ntion [17]. In pre-adipocytes PPARc expression is followed by an\nincrease of ADRP expression (adipose differentiation-related\nprotein) a known direct target gene of PPARc. Although LAP2a\nover-expression alone initiates pre-adipocyte differentiation in\nfibroblasts, it is not sufficient to complete the adipocyte\ndifferentiation program in the absence of additional stimuli [17].\nResults and Discussion\nDisintegration of epithelial network\nSenescence exhibits characteristic histological changes in both\nthe human and mouse thymus [1,23]. In order to demonstrate this\nprocess the thymic lobes of 1 month and 1 year old BALB\/c mice\nwere analyzed (see Figures 1A and 1B). In young adult mice,\nhistology revealed strict segregation of epithelial cell compartments\nby staining for medullary (EpCAM1++, Ly512) and cortical\n(EpCAM1+, Ly51++) epithelial cellular subsets (Figure 1A). This\nshows high level of morphological integrity just preceding\npuberty\/early adulthood. However, the highly organized structure\ndisintegrates and becomes chaotic by the age of 1 year (Figure 1B).\nBy this age the previously shown strict cortico-medullary\ndelineation becomes disintegrated, degenerative vacuoles appear\nsurrounded by areas showing strong co-staining with both\nepithelial markers. There are also other large cellular areas that\nlack staining with either epithelial marker, a pattern completely\nabsent at the young adult age.\nStaining of extracellular matrix components of fibroblast origin\n(ER-TR7++) was also performed on cryostate thymic sections of 2\nFigure 1. Disintegration of epithelial network. Figure 1A demonstrates cryostat section of 1 month, whereas figure 1B presents cryostat section\nof 1 year old BALB\/c mouse thymus.

The\nabove ages were selected to check additional time points and more\nprecisely map the timeframe of thymic physiological senescence (see\nFigures 1C and 1D). The staining patterns are strikingly different at\nthe two ages examined. In the 2 month old thymic tissue section a-\nEpCAM1 and ER-TR7-staining show little tendency for co-\nlocalization. In stark contrast, by the age of 9 months a-EpCAM1\nand ER-TR7-staining show significant overlap within the thymic\nmedulla, a phenomenon completely absent at earlier ages.\nAdipose involution\nTo demonstrate how the disorganization of thymic epithelial\nnetwork is followed by the emergence of adipocytes, thymic\nsections of 1.5 year old GFP-transgenic BALB\/c mice were\nanalyzed. This mouse strain develops and reproduces exactly like\ncontrol BALB\/c mice, and the thymic epithelial function and\nthymocyte maturation is indistinguishable from wild type controls\n[24]. However, due to the ubiquitous and strong EF1 promoter-\ndriven transgene transcription, bright GFP expression offers a\nnative, green-colored, cytoplasmic staining for all the cells in these\nmice. Thymic sections of senescent GFP-transgenic mice were co-\nstained with LipidTox Red to identify adipocytes. Histology shows\nthe presence of relatively large, inflated cells in which the green-\ncolored (GFP-containing) cytoplasm is pushed to the periphery by\nred-staining neutral lipid deposits, a pattern characteristic of\nadipose cells (see Figure 2).\nMolecular changes of thymic epithelium\nHaving presented structural changes of thymic epithelial\nsenescence, we set out to investigate the underlying molecular\nevents. In order to detect gene expression changes, thymic\nepithelial cells were purified from 1 month and 1 year old\nBALB\/c mice based on EpCAM1 expression (MACS separation).\nFollowing cDNA synthesis, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was\nperformed. Several genes including Wnt4, FoxN1, PPARc,\nADRP, lamin1 and LAP2a were tested (Table 1 lists primer\nsequences and characteristics, see Figures 3A\u2013D for changes in\ngene expression). Figure 3A shows that the expression of both\nWnt4 and FoxN1 decreases in thymic epithelial cells. Highly\ndecreased level (or total absence in some cases) of FoxN1 could be\nthe consequence of strong Wnt4 down-regulation by the age of 1\nyear, indicating that thymic epithelial cells can down-regulate\nFoxN1 expression while maintaining that of epithelial cell surface\nmarkers like EpCAM1 [13]. At the same time, mRNA levels of\npre-adipocyte differentiation markers PPARc and ADRP rise with\nage in the same, EpCAM1-positive cell population (Figure 3C).\nThis finding is in harmony with histological data demonstrating\nthe emergence of adipocytes in the thymic lobes of senescent mice\n(Figure 2). The expression of lamin1, a key component of the\nnuclear lamina remains unaffected during senescence in thymic\nepithelial cells; whereas, the expression of LAP2a increases\nsignificantly (see Figure 3B). This degree of dissociation between\nlamin1 and LAP2a expression is of note and suggests functional\ndifferences despite conventionally anticipated association of\nlamin1 and LAP2 molecular family members. The measured\nLAP2a up-regulation associated with age-related adipose involu-\ntion is, however, in perfect agreement with other literature data\nsuggesting the pre-adipocyte differentiation-promoting effect of\nLAP2a in fibroblasts [17]. This is the first report to show that such,\nnormally fibroblast associated molecular changes occur in purified\nthymic epithelial cells. In the literature, epithelial-mesenchymal\ntransition is associated with differential expression of E- and N-\ncadherin [25]. While E-cadherin decreases, N-cadherin normally\ncompensates for the loss of E-cadherin expression. To investigate\nwhether the first step towards pre-adipocyte differentiation is the\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition of epithelial cells, gene expres-\nsion changes of E-cadherin and N-cadherin were measured\n(Figure 3D). While E-cadherin mRNA levels significantly de-\ncreased, N-cadherin gene expression showed a slight increase,\nindicating that EMT might be the initial step in epithelial cell\ntransition to become pre-adipocytes.\nTransgenic cell lines\nStable LAP2a over-expressing or Wnt4-secreting transgenic\nTEP1 cell lines were established using lentiviral transgenesis. The\nuse of a primary-derived model cell line provides the advantage of\nabsolute purity, the complete lack of other cell types that could\npotentially affect the gene expression profile of epithelial cells [26].\nThe established transgenic cell lines proliferated normally and did\nnot show obvious signs of phenotypic changes (data not shown). In\ncontrast to morphology, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed\nthat LAP2a over-expression triggers an immense surge of PPARc\nexpression (Figure 4). Such an increase in mRNA level suggests\nthat this is not a plain quantitative, but rather a qualitative change.\nADRP a direct target gene of PPARc was also up-regulated albeit\nto a lesser extent (Figure 4). On the other hand in Wnt4-secreting\nTEP1 cells the mRNA level of both PPARc and ADRP was\ndecreased (Figure 4). In the TEP1 cell line the expression of FoxN1\ncould not be addressed as it is very low\/undetectable and remains\nas such with all the tested treatments (data not shown).\nTransfected embryonic thymic organ cultures\nTo confirm the involvement of LAP2a and Wnt4 during\nadipogenesis through their direct effect on PPARc expression in\nprimary cells, murine thymic lobes were isolated from timed\npregnancies at E12. Thymic lobes at the age of E12 provide an\nexcellent experimental setting where the thymus has just been\nformed and there is no sign of aging. Furthermore, thymic lobes at\nthis stage are also small enough to be both cultured and transfected\nas a whole, nutrients and virions have free access to most of the\ncells in the lobe without the need of disrupting any intercellular\nconnection or tissue matrix [8,27]. The isolated lobes were\ntherefore transfected with lentiviral vectors encoding GFP (mock),\nWnt4 or LAP2a and were cultured for 4 days in vitro. Q-PCR was\nFigure 2. Adipose involution.

The level of over-expression was confirmed\nfollowing transfection with both LAP2a- and Wnt4-encoding viral\nvectors. Q-PCR analysis revealed that LAP2a over-expression\ntriggers an increase of PPARc expression, whereas additional\nWnt4 secretion suppresses PPARc level (Figure 5B). The latter\nWnt4-mediated suppression of PPARc expression in cultures of\nE12 thymic embryonic lobes was also confirmed by treatment with\nWnt4-containing supernatants of Wnt4 over-expressing TEP1 cell\nline (data not shown). Interestingly, the expression of FoxN1 did\nnot decrease in LAP2a over-expressing thymic lobes (data not\nshown), possibly due to high levels of Wnt4 in the embryonic\nthymic tissue preserving FoxN1 status. Our molecular studies\nusing E12 thymic lobes confirmed our data obtained with the\nTEP1 cell lines, that even in embryonic thymic tissue pre-\nadipocyte differentiation markers can be up-regulated in the\npresence of LAP2a, indicating that the process can be dissected\nand controlled at a molecular level.\nConclusion\nHere we show that with senescence, thymic epithelial Wnt4\nsecretion decreases, possibly below a threshold level that is\nrequired to maintain the identity of established thymic epithelial\ncells. This is measured by the loss of FoxN1 expression, a key\ntranscription factor defining thymic epithelial cell identity.\nHowever, these epithelial cells still express cell surface markers\nFigure 3.

Wnt4\ndeprivation opens up an opportunity for trans-differentiation\ninto pre-adipocytes. The simultaneous increase in LAP2a\nexpression provides the necessary signal that pushes de-\ndifferentiated thymic epithelial cells to differentiate into pre-\nadipocytes, as detected by increased mRNA levels of PPARc\nand ADRP.\nWe propose two different mechanisms for the process of adipose\ninvolution (see Figure 6). The first allows for the direct initiation of\npre-adipocyte differentiation from de-differentiated thymic epi-\nthelial cells due to the down-regulation of Wnt4 and up-regulation\nof LAP2a. Although we cannot rule out this first model, we favor\nthe second model where the process occurs indirectly: de-\ndifferentiation of thymic epithelial cells triggers EMT first, and\nthen the resulting fibroblasts undergo the conventional route of\ndifferentiation program towards adipocyte-lineage commitment.\nThe latter model certainly fits better with current literature of\nEMT [28] and is also supported by our histological and molecular\nresults. Co-localization of a-EpCAM1 and ER-TR7-staining in the\naging thymic medulla (Figure 1D) confirms that in the 9 month old\nthymus there are cells expressing the EpCAM1 marker as a legacy\nof their primary origin, and also secreting ER-TR7-positive\nextracellular matrix components, a function conventionally\nattributed to fibroblast cells. Moreover, Q-PCR data obtained\nwith cDNA samples of MACS-purified thymic epithelial cells also\ndemonstrate an age-related shift in cadherin expression levels\ncharacteristic for EMT (Figure 3D) providing additional evidence\nfor the active process of EMT during thymic epithelial senescence.\nOur model of thymic epithelial senescence is based on data\nobtained with mice undergoing physiological senescence. This is\nthe first model for the molecular basis of the thymic epithelium to\nundergo adipose involution. This model withstands molecular\nlevel proof-of-principle using both a model cell line and primary\nembryonic thymic organ cultures rendered transgenic by lentiviral\ntransgenesis.\nPerspectives\nFurther experiments, however, are required. We plan using\ninducible, LAP2a-transgenic mice to allow us precise temporal-\nspatial over-expression of LAP2a in adult thymic epithelium to\nmodel and decisively verify the role of LAP2a in pre-adipocyte\ntrans-differentiation in vivo exploiting our experience in establish-\ning transgenic animals [24,29]. If LAP2a proves to be a master\nregulator of thymic adipose involution in vivo too, this knowledge\nappoints LAP2a as target molecule for directed rejuvenation of the\nthymic epithelial structure and function. This rejuvenation process\ncould theoretically reinforce na\u0131\u00a8ve T-cell output to reach young\nadult levels that could ameliorate senescence-related immunolog-\nical disorders like impaired antiviral defense and late-onset auto-\nimmune diseases.\nFigure 4.

For\nthe experiments we used thymic lobes from timed pregnancies at\nE12, and also from adult BALB\/c mice at 4 week and 1 year of\nage, and from 1.5 year old GFP-transgenic BALB\/c-mice. Mice\nwere bred in our animal facility; all animal work has been\nconducted according to relevant national and international\nguidelines following approval of ethics committee of the University\nof Pecs. Senescent animals developed and aged normally, without\nany treatment.\nTransgenic cell, organ and animal models\nThe GFP-transgenic BALB\/c model was created using lentiviral\ntransgenesis as published by our group [24]. The Wnt4 sequence\nwas purchased and subcloned from an Origene (Origene) vector\ncontaining human full-length Wnt4 cDNA. The full-length murine\nLAP2a cDNA containing plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Simon\nAmos. The GFP (mock), LAP2a or Wnt4 over-expressing TEP1\ncell lines or E12 thymic lobes were generated using lentiviral\nvectors that were prepared as described previously [30]. Following\novernight lentiviral transfection the thymic lobes were transferred\nover Nucleopore Track-Etch Membranes (Whatman) and were\ncultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS, penicillin,\nstreptomycin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin-B and b-mercapto-\nethanol (Lonza Walkersville).\nHistology using fluorescent antibodies, proteins and dyes\nSections (9 mm) of frozen thymic lobes of BALB\/c mice were\nfixed in cold acetone, then dried and blocked using 5% BSA in\nPBS for 20 min before staining with a-Ly51-PE (clone 6C3), a-\nEpCAM-FITC (clone G8.8), ER-TR7-PE antibodies and DAPI.\nThymic sections of GFP-transgenic mice were fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde before staining with LipidTOX Red following\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen). The sections were\nanalyzed using an Olympus BX61 microscope equipped with a\nCCD camera and AnalySIS software.\nSeparation and enrichment of thymic epithelial cells\nThymic lobes were digested with type F collagenase from C.\nhystolyticum (Sigma) for 30 min, then washed with DMEM 10%\nFCS. Cell suspensions were then labeled with anti-EpCAM1-\nFITC (clone G8.8) and washed with MACS-buffer followed by\nincubation with anti-FITC micro-beads (Miltenyi Biotec), the\nEpCAM+-cells were used for total RNA isolation and subsequent\nquantitative PCR analysis. The cells were purified using MACS\nLS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec).\nRNA isolation, preparation of cDNA, Q-PCR analysis\nTotal RNA was isolated the RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel),\nincluding an on column DNA digestion step. cDNA was\nconstructed using the high capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Applied\nBiosystems). For Q- PCR analysis, we used an AB7500 platform\nand either SYBR green or TaqMan PCR master mix (Applied\nBiosystems). Gene expression was normalized to b-actin. The\nsequences and data of primers are listed in Table 1.\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed on three occasions, represen-\ntative experiments are shown. Measures were obtained in\ntriplicates; data are presented as mean 61 SD by error bars.\nAcknowledgments\nThe supernatant of ER-TR7 hybridoma clone was originally donated by\nDr. Willem van Ewijk to Dr. Peter Balogh, who provided it for the authors.\nThe authors are grateful to Prof. S.
