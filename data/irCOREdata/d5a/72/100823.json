Because of these properties,\nsuch materials are often termed as negative-index \u0001NI\u0002 or\nleft-handed \u0001LH\u0002 materials, as opposed to ordinary media\nthat are always right handed \u0001RH\u0002. Recently, these media\nhave garnered revived interest after the proposal of Pendry et\nal. that a metamaterial possessing negative magnetic perme-\nability in the microwave region could be constructed with a\npair of split-ring resonators.2\nImportant potential applications of LH materials in op-\ntics and microwaves, such as the possibility to create super-\nresolving lenses or to improve the performance of biosensor-\ning devices, prompted additional investigations into the\nproperties of specific LH heterostructures.3,4 From this re-\nsearch it was shown that LH waveguides support two classes\nof waves: oscillatory or waveguide modes \u0001OM\u0002\/fast waves,\nwhich are also found in regular dielectric slab structures, and\na rich variety of surface plasmon polariton modes \u0001SPP\u0002\/\nslow waves. An analytic study of the latter5 showed that up\nto 30 bound SPPs can exist in a generalized LH slab wave-\nguide for all choices of optogeometrical parameters. Al-\nthough approximately a third of the SPP solutions allow for\nattaining zero group velocity, their inherent sensitivity to\nsmall variations of the media interfaces5 may limit their prac-\ntical use. For this reason, oscillatory modes, which generally\nhave their maxima inside the waveguide core, are more suit-\nable for most conceived applications, including slow light.\nNonetheless, they were, until now, described only qualita-\ntively, following ad hoc graphic solution approaches.3,4 In\nthis manner, relevant modal properties were either not re-\nvealed or not conclusively proven and, importantly, explicit\nexpressions for the cutoff conditions of each mode have not\nbeen established yet.\nIn this letter we report on an extension of waveguide\nmode theory that considers an asymmetric three-layer slab\nheterostructure in which either the guiding region or the\ncladding region may have a negative refractive index. We\nderive dimensionless, closed-form expressions for the cut-\noff\u0001s\u0002 of the investigated oscillatory modes that allow for the\nidentification of their existence regions. The modes with\nnegative energy flux that give rise to negative group velocity\nare identified via an explicit expression for the cycle-\naveraged total power flow Ptot in the guide. Based on this\ntreatment we rigorously prove that, with judicious choice of\nparameters, there is a frequency region where the second\nmode can, at the same time, exist alone and attain zero group\nvelocity. Moreover, we show that the inverted \u0001LH-RH-LH\u0002\narrangement supports similar modes as the RH-LH-RH het-\nerostructure but with opposite power flux. It is believed that\nthese are the only slab waveguide structures utilizing homo-\ngeneous, isotropic6 media that have the potential for single-\nmode operation in the \u201cslow-light regime.\u201d\nIn the analysis that follows we consider the geometry\nillustrated in Fig. 1, where all media are assumed to be\nlossless,7 homogeneous, and isotropic. We shall be con-\ncerned primarily with p-polarized \u0001TM\u0002 waves, in which the\nmagnetic field is directed along the y axis. First, we investi-\ngate the case where the core is LH with thickness 2\u0001,\nbounded asymmetrically by two RH media that satisfy n2\n\u0002n3.

In this\nwork, the two V parameters are defined as V2\u0001\u0001k0\u0002\n=\u0001k0\u0001\u0004r1\u0005r1\u2212\u0004r2\u0005r2\u00021\/2 and V3\u0001\u0001k0\u0002=\u0001k0\u0001\u0004r1\u0005r1\u2212\u0004r3\u0005r3\u00021\/2,\nwhereas U=\u0001\b=\u0001k0\u0001\u0004r1\u0005r1\u2212neff\n2 \u00021\/2, with \b standing for the\ntransverse component of the wave vector in the core. It is\nnoteworthy that similar dispersion expressions, cast in an\n\u201cinverted\u201d form that is obtained following a zigzag-ray\nmodel analysis, describe oscillatory modes in standard asym-\nmetric optical waveguides.8 The parameters used in Eqs. \u00012\u0002\nand \u00013\u0002 here, though, obey the restrictions 0\tb\t1 and t\n\u00021. The equalities for b hold at the mode-cutoff points. For\neach mode \u0001m=0,1 , . . . \u0002 and refractive index distribution,\nthe dispersion diagrams, neff versus the reduced slab thick-\nness \u0001k0, may be directly obtained by noting that b in Eq. \u00011\u0002\nis a function of neff, which in turn increases monotonically\nfrom n2 to \u0005n1\u0005.\nIn discussing the cutoff conditions, it is important to rec-\nognize the fact that several double mode-degeneracy points\ncan, in principle, appear in the dispersion diagrams since\nsome of the modes in the LH heterostructure will be back-\nward propagating, having antiparallel phase \u0001\nph\u0002 and group\n\u0001\ng\u0002 velocities. The cycle-averaged total power flow Ptot at\nthese \u0001cutoff\u0002 points will vanish. It is therefore useful to de-\nrive a general closed-form expression for Ptot. Integrating the\nz component of the complex pointing vector over the guide\u2019s\ncross section,5 considering Eq. \u00011\u0002, we obtain the following\nafter some algebraic manipulations:\nP3 = C\n1\n\u0005\u0004r1\u0005\n\u0001\u000b\n\u0006\u0004W3\n, \u00014a\u0002\nP1 = C\n\u0001\u000b\n\u0005\u0004r1\u0005\nW3\n2 + \u0006\u0004\n2U2\n\u0006\u0004\n2U2 \n \u0003\u0004W2W22 + \u0003\u00042U2 + \u0006\u0004W3W32 + \u0006\u00042U2 \u2212 2\u000b ,\n\u00014b\u0002\nP2 = C\n\u0001\u000b\n\u0005\u0004r1\u0005\u0003\u0004W2\n\u0003\u0004\n2\n\u0006\u0004\n2\nW3\n2 + \u0006\u0004\n2U2\nW2\n2 + \u0003\u0004\n2U2\n, \u00014c\u0002\nwhere Pi \u0001i=1,2 ,3\u0002 is the power confined in the waveguide\ni layer \u0001Fig. 1\u0002, \u000b and Wj \u0001j=2,3\u0002 the mode longitudinal\npropagation and decay constants, respectively, and C an ar-\nbitrary positive constant. It is inferred from Eqs. \u00014a\u0002\u2013\u00014c\u0002\nthat the net power flow can become negative in the core\nlayer, but remains positive in the cladding regions. Calculat-\ning the total power Ptot=\ri=1\n3 Pi, in terms of the dimension-\nless parameters defined before and the reduced slab thick-\nness, we arrive at\nPtot = C\nW3\n2 + \u0006\u0004\n2U2\n\u0006\u0004\n2U2\n\u0003n1\n2\u0001\u0001k0\u00022 \u2212 U2\u00041\/2\n\u0005\u0004r1\u0005\n\n \u0003\u0004W2 V2\n2\nW2\n2 + \u0003\u0004\n2U2\n+\n\u0006\u0004\nW3\nV3\n2\nW3\n2 + \u0006\u0004\n2U2\n\u2212 2\u000b . \u00015\u0002\nTo facilitate the discussion of the mode-cutoff relation-\nships, we first note from Eq. \u00011\u0002 that the upper branches \u0001b\n\u21920\u0002, for all modes other than the fundamental \u0001m\u00030\u0002,\nshow no upper cutoff thickness, since b\u21920 in this case\nyields \u0001k0\u2192\f. The situation is reminiscent of OMs in nor-\nmal dielectric slab structures and is illustrated in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nHowever, for the fundamental mode \u0001m=0\u0002 inspection of Eq.\n\u00011\u0002 reveals a somewhat unusual behavior and a low cutoff\npoint given by\n\u0005\u0001\u0001k0\u0002\u0005low\nm=0\n=\n1\n2\u0005n1\u0005\n\n \u0003\u0004\b1 \u2212 \u0003\u00042\u0003\u00052 + \u0006\u0004\b1 \u2212 \u0006\u00042\u0006\u00052 \u000b . \u00016\u0002\nAt this transition point, depicted in Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002, the SPP-1\nmode5 transforms continuously to the m=0 oscillatory mode,\nwhose field pattern closely resembles that of a surface wave.\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Variation of SPP and fundamental oscillatory mode \u0001OM\u0002 effective index neff with the reduced slab thickness \u0001k0 for \u0006\u0004=1.1, \u0006\u0005=0.5,\n\u0003\u0004=1.15, \u0003\u0005=0.6, \u0004r1=2, and \u0005r1=1.2. \u0001b\u0002 Variation of oscillatory mode effective index with reduced slab thickness for \u0006\u0004=\u0006\u0005=0.05, \u0003\u0004=\u0003\u0005=0.08, and\n\u0004r1=\u0005r1=6. \u0001c\u0002 Variation of oscillatory mode normalized power flow P with reduced slab thickness for the parameters defined in \u0001b\u0002.\n201103-2 Tsakmakidis et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nIn Ref. 9, the existence of such cutoff point for the m=0\noscillatory mode in asymmetric three-layer LH heterostruc-\ntures has been associated with the appearance of a complete\nthree-dimensional photonic band gap. Critically, the funda-\nmental mode also exhibits an upper cutoff that can be calcu-\nlated as\n\u0005\u0001\u0001k0\u0002\u0005upper\nm=0\n=\n1\n2\u0005n1\u0005\b1 \u2212 \u0003\u0004\u0003\u0005\n\tatan\n \u0006\u0004\bt2 \u2212 1\u000b\n+ \u0007\nm + 12\u000b\f . \u00017\u0002\nThis relationship also describes the upper cutoff point of all\nlower branches in the mode-dispersion diagrams. An exem-\nplary result of such curves for a \u201cslow-light oriented\u201d choice\nof optogeometrical parameters is shown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002, with the\ninsets illustrating the corresponding field profiles. For the\nsake of clarity, the dispersion curve of the fundamental TM1\nmode is not shown here, since the upper cutoff point of this\nmode is \u0005\u0001\u0001k0\u0002\u0005upper\nm=0 \u000e0.187 63, i.e., well below the \u201cdegen-\neracy\u201d point of the TM2 branch, which occurs at \u0005\u0001\u0001k0\u0002\u0005deg\nm=1\n\u000e0.310 47. The proposed nomenclature for recognizing the\noscillatory modes consists of a pair of letters to identify the\npolarization, followed by a subscript to track the number of\nnodes in the core region and a superscript to designate that\nthe mode is forward \u0001f\u0002 or backward \u0001b\u0002, i.e., TMm+1f\/b for the\nmth-order mode.\nFigure 2\u0001c\u0002 reports the variation of the normalized power\nflow P= Ptot \/ \u0001\u0005P1 \u0005 + \u0005P2 \u0005 + \u0005P3 \u0005 \u0002 \u0001Ref. 5\u0002 with reduced slab\nthickness for the previous solutions. One may notice that the\ntwo branches of the TM2 mode merge at a critical slab thick-\nness. At this \u0001cutoff\u0002 point the total power Ptot of the result-\ning degenerate mode vanishes and the group velocity reduces\nto zero.10 An exact expression for this cutoff point cannot be\ngiven except in the somewhat simplified form of Ptot=0.\nHowever, for every mode \u0001m=1,2 , . . . \u0002 this point can be\nswiftly calculated following the steps for the derivation of\nthe dispersion diagrams outlined above and requiring\n\u0001k0\u0001neff\u0002\u2192min.\nSince the TM1 and TM2f modes always show an upper\ncutoff, given by Eq. \u00017\u0002, we conclude that there is a unique\nand experimentally intriguing region, highlighted by the gray\narea in Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002, where the backward TM2b mode can, at the\nsame time, exist alone and allow for attaining very small or\nzero group velocity via adiabatically tapering to the degen-\neracy point. Under somewhat stronger guidance conditions,\ni.e., \u0003\u0004\u0003\u0005 ,\u0006\u0004\u0006\u0005\u21920 for constant cladding indices, it is further\npossible to altogether suppress the TM2f branch, thereby in-\ncreasing the operable width of the highlighted region from\napproximately 0.134 to 0.274, for the case shown in Fig.\n2\u0001c\u0002.\nRemarkably, similar modes with reversed power flow are\nsupported by the inverted heterostructure, i.e., one with a RH\ncore \u0001e.g., air\u0002 and LH claddings. Indeed, by again assuming\na waveguide-mode ansatz for Hy, i.e., oscillatory field in the\ncore and exponentially decaying field in the cladding re-\ngions, and requiring continuity of the tangential field compo-\nnents at the two interfaces, we find that the characteristic Eq.\n\u00011\u0002 remains unchanged, and so does the expression for the\nsole magnetic field component Hy. In a similar vein, it is\nfound that for the new expressions of the cycle-averaged\npower flow in each layer, one only needs to replace \u0005\u0004r1\u0005 in\nEqs. \u00014a\u0002\u2013\u00014c\u0002 with \u2212\u0005\u0004r1\u0005. Based on the explicit form of Eq.\n\u00011\u0002 and since the V parameters defined above are independent\nof the refractive index sign distribution, it is inferred that all\nmodal properties of the RH-LH-RH arrangement, previously\nanalyzed, are replicated by its \u201cdual\u201d counterpart. It appears\nat this time that this is the only pair of planar waveguides\nconstructed from isotropic media that can do so. This prop-\nerty also provides increased flexibility in slow-light\nwaveguiding design utilizing LH materials.\nIn summary, on the basis of an exact, analytic appraisal,\nit has been shown that an asymmetric planar waveguide uti-\nlizing LH media in either the core or the cladding can sup-\nport single-mode operation in the slow-light regime. The in-\nvestigated scheme, relying on sufficient decrease of slab\nthickness, combines the remarkably simple approach for\nslowing down light suggested in Ref. 11 with the use of\nefficiently excitable waveguide modes used in Ref. 12, since\nthe profile of the TM2 solution here closely matches that of a\nsingle-mode fiber. Moreover, the heterostructures investi-\ngated here can be designed to be monomode in the desired\nfrequency range.13 The control of the group velocity is\nachieved by varying the core thickness rather than by vary-\ning the temperature or field intensity.12,14 The same is true for\nthe light in- and outcoupling, which may be satisfactorily\nadjusted by adiabatically tapering the size of the waveguide\ncore. We stress that this mechanism for decelerating light\ndoes not directly rely on refractive index resonances but\nmerely on the exchange of power between the core and clad-\nding regions, as indicated by Eqs. \u00014\u0002 and \u00015\u0002. Hence, broad\nband slow light can be obtained provided that the negative\nmaterial parameters are designed to exist over relatively\nlarge bandwidths15 at optical frequencies.16\nThis work is partially supported by the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Council \u0001EPSRC\u0002, UK.\n1V.
