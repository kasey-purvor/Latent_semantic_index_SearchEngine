This paper explores the experience of one young woman growing up in a \nlate-Victorian suburb, and assesses the ways in which she negotiated the structures of this \nemerging \u201emodern\u201f environment, so as to construct her own identity and behaviour. \nEvidence is drawn from one very detailed diary covering the period 1884 to 1892, and \nattention is focused on three aspects of everyday life: public and social space; domestic \nroutine; and friendships and relationships. The conventional view of middle-class \nsuburban domesticity is challenged by evidence from this diary, which suggests that it \nwas the public and social life of the suburb that was of particular importance to young \nwomen. While older married women\u201fs experiences were centred upon maintaining a \nrespectable home, the provincial suburban environment offered to young single women \nconsiderable opportunities for independent mobility and action, which were restricted by \nrelatively few familial constraints. The diarist did not fundamentally challenge the culture \nof middle-class suburbia, but instead was able to manipulate many social expectations to \nher own advantage. As a site of on-going development and malleable norms, late-\nnineteenth-century suburbia offered its young elite residents opportunities for a certain \ndegree of social, cultural and spatial autonomy that was understood to be essential to the \nlife of the nascent community.   \n \n \n 4 \nKey words: suburb, diary, youth, gender, modernity, Merseyside \nRunning Head: Constructing a suburban identity\n 5 \nSuburban growth was one of the main characteristics of late-nineteenth-century British \ntowns and cities.\n1\n Although the precise definition of what constitutes a suburb can be \ndebated, by the second half of the nineteenth century all urban areas were experiencing \nsuch growth.\n2\n A suburban lifestyle rapidly became the aspiration of a high proportion of \nurban dwellers and the suburb was recognised by contemporaries as a desirable spatial \nform. Those concerned with Victorian housing and health reforms were quick to extol the \nadvantages of suburban life, which was perceived to provide space, fresh air and a \nhealthy environment.\n3\n  \n \nThe physical form of Victorian suburbia was highly varied, ranging from relatively high-\ndensity developments of terraced housing for skilled working-class and lower middle-\nclass families, to low-density villa developments in semi-rural environments for the more \naffluent.\n4\n However, what united such diverse suburbs as a distinctive urban form was less \ntheir physical features than the cultural attributes that their residents were believed to \nshare. Middle-class suburban lifestyles in particular were classically characterised as \nproviding a combination of financial and psychological security, social respectability, and \ndomestic privacy. Not only did suburban development allow physical separation from the \nurban poor, but also it provided a set of cultural signifiers that enabled the establishment \nof a middle-class identity.\n5\n The quasi-proper name \u201eSuburbia\u201f was coined to define such \nspaces in the 1890s, and this distinctively late-Victorian social milieu allowed the \ncreation of a stable home and family life, the consumption of the expanding material \nculture of respectability, and the pursuit of everyday activities in the company of others \nwith a similar background and mindset.\n6\n  \n 6 \n \nAlthough the ambivalent literary representations of suburbia have been studied, the ways \nin which suburban values and experiences were understood by their inhabitants have been \nrarely considered.\n7\n \u201eThe paucity of sources\u201f has left middle-class experiences of suburban \nlife as \u201emissing voices\u201f in the existing historiography.8 This paper adopts the prism of one \nyoung woman\u201fs diary to explore the ways in which she used, interpreted and appropriated \na late-nineteenth-century provincial suburb so as to construct her own lifestyle and \nidentity.    \n \nIt has been argued that the suburb and the cult of domesticity, which it fostered, was a \nspace of particular importance for women and one in which men were increasingly \nuncomfortable.\n9\n Studies have focused on the responsibilities of married women for whom \na suburban lifestyle placed expectations of high standards of domestic cleanliness, \n\u201escientific\u201f child-rearing and a public display of respectability.10 The experiences of \nyounger, single suburban women were potentially quite different, but have rarely been \nconsidered.  \n \nThis absence is surprising given that the figure of the \u201eNew Woman\u201f emerged \nconcurrently with the ideal of the suburb. The \u201eNew Woman\u201f was primarily a literary \ncreation who flouted conventions, asserted her independence, demanded educational, \nsexual and occupational equality and adopted youthful, irreverent and shocking codes of \nbehaviour. Both the image of the suburb and the \u201eNew Woman\u201f were interpreted as signs \nof fin-de-si\u00e8cle modernity and were widely satirised. However, while mockery of the \n 7 \naspiring conformist suburbanite was understood to have light-hearted and comic \npotential, the \u201eNew Woman\u201f was interpreted by many as a profound political and social \nthreat.\n11\n Likewise, the apparent safety of the space of the suburb contrasted with anxieties \nthat were expressed about women\u201fs increasing cultural prominence as shoppers, \njournalists and professional workers in London.\n12\n It is therefore revealing to explore the \ninteraction between these two images, so as to consider both the gendering of the suburb \nand the suburbanising of young women.  \n \nIt was in the final decades of the nineteenth century that many have suggested that \n\u201eadolescence\u201f began to be understood as a universally experienced and distinct life-cycle \nstage, which required specialised treatment. It has been suggested that the adoption of \nsecondary, especially boarding, school education for the sons and latterly the daughters of \nthe middle class was critical in establishing a separate age-defined period between \nchildhood and adulthood.\n13\n The rising mean age of marriage combined with a national \nconcern about the perceived \u201efitness\u201f of the young further contributed to the construction \nof independent cultures of boyhood and girlhood for which novels, periodicals, advice \nmanuals, sporting associations and voluntary youth groups increasingly also catered.\n14\n  \n \nWhile historians have demonstrated the importance of shifting psychological, \nphysiological and pedagogical understandings of youth, there is an extensive \ncontemporary geographical literature that maintains the centrality of young people in \nforming conceptions of childhood and youth. Instead of merely being subject to changing \nconstructions of themselves by adults, these studies argue for the importance of \n 8 \nidentifying child agency and of listening to children\u201fs voices.15 For the late-nineteenth \ncentury generational cultures have been identified primarily through gang cultures whose \nagency was demonstrated through rebellions led by working-class lads.\n16\n This article \nsuggests that late-Victorian suburban society also produced constraints to which middle-\nclass young women responded. However, the relatively insubstantial and malleable \nstructures of nascent suburbia in the 1880s and 1890s meant that the younger generation \nwere able to construct their own versions of suburban identity that were formative in \nshaping, rather than rejecting, late-Victorian middle-class society. \n \nThis paper explores these themes through the analysis of the writings of one young \nwoman, Elizabeth Lee, who kept a daily diary from the age of sixteen in 1884 until 1892. \nElizabeth was the eldest child and only daughter of a draper and gentleman\u201fs outfitter. \nThroughout the period of the diary she was unmarried and living in her parents\u201f home in \nPrenton, a suburb of Birkenhead, on Merseyside in north-west England. The surviving \nmanuscript fills one large folio of 120 pages, often written in a cramped and untidy hand, \nand the typed transcript of the text runs to over 150,000 words.\n17\n  \n \nBy examining the everyday experiences of suburban life through the eyes of one \nindividual, it is possible to assess the extent to which contemporary suburban ideals were \nattained, the degree to which this writer perceived some of the structures of suburban \nsociety to be constraining, and the ways in which she rebelled against or reconfigured \nthem to construct her own identity. Interpretation is set within the context of structuration \ntheory, in which it is argued that individual agency interacted with deeper structures \n 9 \nthrough everyday social practices, and in doing so produced particular social and spatial \noutcomes.\n18\n Thus it can be suggested that the actions of middle-class youth interacted \nwith the structures of suburban society, and through their social practices adolescents had \nthe opportunity to produce structural change. Because identity is such an elusive and \npersonal concept, it is never possible to know exactly how identities were formed and \nchanged, though there is a large geographical literature that explores the relationships \nbetween identity and place.\n19\n However, a detailed personal diary, which records the \nminutiae of everyday life, allows us to get closer to concepts of individual identity than \nmost sources. By analysing this account within the context of an emerging suburb, and by \nrelating it to the values and ideals of suburban living, it is possible to begin to explore the \ninteraction of structure and agency within a particular setting.  \n \nThe difficulties associated with the historical analysis of self writing are well known. \nMost attention has been focused on the interpretation of autobiographies and life \nhistories, which were usually written late in life, with an audience in mind and often \nstructured to a particular format.\n20\n Diaries can share some of these problems \u2013 for \ninstance diaries kept by politicians and other prominent people in order to record their \nversion of events \u2013 though all diaries do have the advantage of immediacy. Diaries also, \nnecessarily, project a particular and selective image of the writer.\n21\n In this sense, all self \nwriting has a story to tell that must be taken into account in interpretation.  \n \nElizabeth Lee did not come from a well-educated or literary family. Apart from letters to \nfriends and family, there is no evidence that she engaged in any other literary activities. \n 10 \nIn the first sentence of the extant diary, Elizabeth merely notes that the previous year \u201eI \ntook it into my head to write a \u201eDiary\u201f\u201f and on being given a diary for 1884 by her father, \nshe began the surviving volume. There is no apparent motive, other than the desire to \nrecord what she did, and she mentions no intended readership. The diary was mostly \nwritten up daily. There are few crossings out or evidence of censorship, apart from during \nthe final months of the diary when she was going through a particularly turbulent period \nin her love life. Spelling and grammar are often inconsistent and the diary records not \nonly events but also her thoughts, hopes and fears. This paper explores the ways in which \nthese were constituted by \u2013 and in turn shaped \u2013 the emerging suburban community in \nwhich Elizabeth was growing up by focusing on three themes: her experiences of the \npublic and social spaces of the suburb; her home life and private domesticity; and \nfriendships and relationships that cut across the divide between public and private sites \nwithin suburbia. \n \nPUBLIC AND SOCIAL SPACE \nIn 1905 the Liberal politician and writer C.F.G. Masterman expressed his horror at the \ngrowth of London: \u201eNorth, East, South, and West the aggregation is silently pushing \noutwards like some gigantic plasmodium: spreading slimy arms over the surrounding \nfields, heavily dragging after them the ruin of its desolation\u201f.22 It was in a very different, \nbut also rapidly changing, landscape of encroaching development that Elizabeth Lee grew \nup. How did she interact with this suburban environment? \n \n 11 \nThe Lee family were suburban pioneers. At the age of fourteen in 1882 Elizabeth moved \nwith her family from rooms above her father\u201fs drapers shop in the town of Birkenhead to \nthe newly expanding semi-rural suburb of Prenton. In the 1880s the suburb of Prenton \nwas in the early stages of development. In 1881 the parish contained just 17 inhabited \nhouses and 111 persons, rising to 30 houses and 267 inhabitants by 1891.\n23\n At this date \nher parents were raising five younger brothers in addition to Elizabeth, and four more \nboys were to be born over the following eight years. Mr Lee was prospering in business \nand he oversaw the building of a large detached villa in Prenton. He also retained land \naround the house and in the surrounding rural area, which he used as a hobby \nsmallholding. The Lee\u201fs villa was named \u201eWharfedale\u201f, so as to reflect both Elizabeth \nparents\u201f origins in this Yorkshire valley and their image of a rural idyll.  \n \nBy the 1880s the roads leading to Prenton were lined with a mixture of terraced houses \n(close to Birkenhead) and then larger terraced, semi-detached and detached villas.\n24\n \nElizabeth observed with interest as the suburb was built around the Lee family home: \n \nI took the children out this afternoon. There are a lot of young fellows measuring \nthe land on the Storeton Rd, and they were throwing kisses to me and whistling \nand carrying on dreadfully. I was talking to Miss Beale (who was out in the \ngarden) a good bit.\n25\n \n \nNot only did the young surveyors offer an amusing attraction for seventeen-year-old \nElizabeth, but the excitement of the arrival of neighbours was also later commented upon: \n 12 \n\u201e\u2026 Mr. Drape came up with Papa this afternoon to look over some houses which have \nbeen built opposite us, and he has decided to have one; so we shall have some \nneighbours.\u201f26 Mr Drape was a close friend of Elizabeth\u201fs family, a business associate of \nher father\u201fs and for a period his employee, so that ties of commerce, friendship and \nneighbourhood were mutually reinforcing in suburban society.   \n \nAs more villas were built, Prenton also gained the services that were desirable for a \nsuburban lifestyle. For instance, in 1886 Elizabeth recorded the opening of Prenton \nPavilion and a tennis club, which also organised an annual dance. In 1890 the Lees sold \nsome of their land for the construction of a new Congregational Church, and both the \nPavilion and the many churches in the neighbourhood hosted a range of social, \neducational and community events.  \n \nThroughout the period of her diary Elizabeth lived a very active life. It was rare for her to \nspend a day in which she did not walk around the suburb on her own. She went out \nfrequently for personal shopping, to lectures, to church, for entertainments, to visit \nfriends or simply to walk around the surrounding streets and fields. Indeed, one \nresponsibility that she performed for her family was to take the younger children out for \nwalks, using the recently paved streets of the suburb that facilitated the pushing of the \nperambulator.\n27\n From the record in the diary, Elizabeth attended public social events in \nthe suburb with far greater regularity than her father, mother or younger brothers. Her \nparents only very irregularly worshipped at their Anglican church, while she attended up \nto three times per week when in her teens and most weeks when in her mid-twenties; she \n 13 \nmade no record of her family\u201fs presence at most of the lectures, concerts and \nentertainments that were increasingly frequently held; and the organisation of, and \nattendance at, public music hall dances and balls was dominated by the young. There is \nno record of Elizabeth\u201fs mother taking on an active role in any of the suburb\u201fs public \nsocial occasions, while her father was largely involved in wider masculine and \ncommercial networks on the Wirral. It was therefore primarily around the participation \nand interests of the young single suburbanite that the public social life of the elite \ncommunity developed.  \n \nAlthough the majority of Elizabeth\u201fs action space was focused on an area within about \nthree kilometres of her home, particularly the immediate locality around which she \nwalked (Prenton and parts of Birkenhead near to her father\u201fs two shops), she also \ntravelled further afield. Elizabeth\u201fs father owned a horse and \u201edogcart\u201f and (from July \n1888) two Shetland ponies and a trap, but she rarely had access to these. Two symbols of \nthe \u201eNew Woman\u201fs\u201f fin-de-si\u00e8cle mobility \u2013 the ability to ride a bicycle and to drive \u2013 \nwere also ones upon which Elizabeth commented in her diary, perceiving them to be \ndaring and exciting activities.\n28\n Unlike her brothers, she did not regularly ride a bicycle, \nbut Elizabeth did learn to drive a horse and cart while on holiday with a male friend in the \nIsle of Man, noting that \u201epeople did look, as it is quite an uncommon thing to see a lady \ndriving\u201f.29 She later drove her father\u201fs dogcart with a different male friend around her \nhome area on the Wirral.\n30\n  \n \n 14 \nHowever, new forms of public transport were of far greater importance than these \nmodern private means of travelling in allowing Elizabeth to make journeys that could not \nbe undertaken on foot. Her home was only three kilometres from the Birkenhead ferry \nterminal that provided access to the city of Liverpool. A horse-drawn tram provided \nregular transport from an adjacent street to the centre of town. Elizabeth was thus able to \nbe part of the urban area of Birkenhead and had easy access to Liverpool, but at the same \ntime was able to enjoy the advantages of space, seclusion and status afforded by the \nsuburb. She made regular trips to central Liverpool both for shopping and for \nentertainment, and also travelled elsewhere (for instance to visit relatives in Yorkshire \nand on holidays). \n \nAlthough sometimes Elizabeth travelled with friends and occasionally with family, she \nmoved around this area alone at most times of the day and night. Her opportunities were \nmost restricted in terms of times, locations and companions at the start of the diary when \nshe was relatively young and when her parents exerted an obvious influence on her \nactivities. However, by the age of twenty-one there were few apparent restrictions and \nshe seemed to move freely and frequently around the locality. Thus whilst some aspects \nof her everyday mobility and leisure activities were centred on the suburb in which she \nlived and involved contact with neighbours and people known to her parents, many \nactivities required her to move outside this environment. \n \nElizabeth frequently made the journey from Prenton to Birkenhead. In 1884 she noted the \nfirst time that she travelled home on the tram alone, after having served in her father\u201fs \n 15 \nshop. The close community of the suburb is emphasised by the fact that she shared the \ntram with at least one other passenger who she knew.\n 31\n Later travelling alone from her \nfather\u201fs shop or from friends\u201f homes in Birkenhead became a regular occurrence, as this \nexample of an evening in 1885 suggests:  \n \nI went to Birkenhead tonight and put my white dress and best hat on. Mr. Elliot \nand the rest of them did stare at me when I got to the shop. It was because I was \ndressed up so I suppose. I went to Katie Egerton. They are without a servant. \nThen I went to see Lottie Heathcock. She has had a cousin stopping with her. She \nis going to Bristol in a fortnight. Pa had gone home when I got to the shop so I \nhad to come home by myself.\n32\n \n \nWhen walking at night Elizabeth was mostly in the company of friends, but she also \ntravelled alone. In 1885 she noted that she parted from the male friend with whom she \nhad spent the evening in Birkenhead and that \u201eThen I had to get into the B\u201fhead Park \ntram, as there was no other, and arrived home at \u00bd past 11 o\u201fclock.\u201f This indirect tram \nroute was inconvenient and Elizabeth noted that she was \u201eso tired\u201f on arriving home, but \nshe made no other special comment about the journey and it was not unusual for her to \nundertake these journeys by public transport alone and without comment.\n33\n  On occasion \nshe recorded coming home alone after all of the trams had stopped running for the night, \nso she must have walked unaccompanied. Such travel to and from Birkenhead was an \neveryday occurrence during the night and day. Although Elizabeth often enjoyed the \n 16 \ncompany of friends and sometimes of family, these were not required for her to travel \naround the area outside of the immediate suburb of Prenton. \n \nElizabeth also regularly crossed the Mersey to Liverpool by ferry and, after the rail tunnel \nopened in 1886, by train. As with her trips to Birkenhead, although she often undertook \noutings in the company of both male and female friends, she also frequently travelled \nalone and did not seem in the least perturbed when this occurred. For instance, the day \nthat the railway tunnel opened, Elizabeth deliberately took herself alone to Liverpool to \nuse this new means of transport and recorded her excitement at experiencing the lift, the \ncrush of people and the gentlemen on the station: \n \nFine day. The railway under the Tunnel was opened for traffic today and I went to \nL\u201fpool by it. I went up in the \u201clift\u201d when I got to L\u201fpool and there was such a \nfrightful crush to get it. Had a good look round L\u201fpool and came back by train. \nSuch a lot of gentleman in the station. It was so jolly but I got nearly squashed to \ndeath.\n34\n  \n \nOnly on two exceptional occasions did Elizabeth note any fears when travelling.\n35\n At all \nother times she moved freely and without apparent concern both within and outside the \nsuburb. \n \nThe public environment of the suburb offered a space that facilitated the independence of \nyoung middle-class women, such as Elizabeth Lee.  It offered a range of suitable public \n 17 \nfacilities and entertainments, and many companions with whom they could be shared. \nThe interests and active involvement of the large number of single young men and \nwomen were fundamental to the construction of the public social, religious and sporting \nlife of the suburb. Moreover, the perception of safety and propriety within a select small \ncommunity also allowed such activities to be attended alone. However, the town of \nBirkenhead and the central parts of the city of Liverpool were also spaces in which \nElizabeth felt comfortable. The development of dense urban and suburban public \ntransport networks in the second half of the nineteenth century offered opportunities for \nindependent mobility that would not have been available to young middle-class women a \ngeneration earlier, to those growing up in more remote rural areas or to those living in \nurban environments that were considered dangerous and potentially unsuitable for \nrespectable women. In this way, the late-nineteenth-century suburb was a unique public \nspace in which youthful independence was taken for granted and from which the young \ncould also use their freedoms to explore the attractions of the town and city.  \n \nHOME LIFE AND DOMESTICITY \nThe fictional lower-middle-class suburban diarist of the 1880s, Mr Pooter, wrote of his \ndevotion to domesticity and home improvements:  \n \nAfter my work in the City, I like to be at home. What\u201fs the good of a home, if you \nare never in it? \u201eHome, Sweet, Home\u201f, that\u201fs my motto. I am always in of an \nevening\u2026 There is always something to be done\u202636 \n \n 18 \nStudies of twentieth-century suburbia have suggested that an increasingly intensive and \ndemanding cult of domesticity encapsulated these values, so that it structured the lives of \nmarried women.\n37\n To what extent were the lives of an earlier generation of young \nsuburban women similarly shaped by this cult of the home?  \n \nElizabeth Lee was educated at a middle-class girls\u201f school in Cheshire and then (briefly) \nat a boarding school in Colwyn Bay in north Wales. However, she left the boarding \nschool two months before her fifteenth birthday due to a bout of rheumatic fever and \nnever continued her formal education. Throughout the period of the diary she was \nmaintained financially by her parents and occasionally served in her father\u201fs shops \nwithout payment, but her principal work was centred on the home.  \n \nElizabeth was well aware of the significance of the domestic to ideals of femininity and \nto the education that she was expected to acquire. At New Year 1885 she copied a list of \n\u201eWhat a girl should learn\u201f from an unspecified manual or magazine into her diary. One-\nthird of these qualities related to domestic duties, including the ability to clean, sew, \nmend, cook, make bread, care for the sick and \u201emake home happy\u201f.38 However, qualities \nof character, morality and religion dominated the list, which were likewise the focus of \nthe six \u201ecelebrated Mrs. Fry\u201fs Rules for the guidance of daily life\u201f that Elizabeth had \nrecorded the previous New Year.\n39\n All of the prescriptive literature to which Elizabeth \nmade reference recommended appropriate codes of femininity that were not centred \nsolely on the domestic.   \n \n 19 \nIt was thus the practical demands of maintaining large households, more than abstract \nideals of femininity, which placed domestic roles at the heart of the duties that middle-\nclass parents expected their daughters to perform. Elizabeth was seven years older than \nher next surviving brother, and her mother bore a total of twelve children (nine of whom \nsurvived to adulthood) between 1867 and 1890. Mrs Lee\u201fs frequent confinements, the \npresence of a tribe of young brothers, the large size of the house, and the frequency of \nlabour-intensive and dirty \u201eimprovements\u201f to the home all consumed a significant amount \nof time. A total of 57 different servants passed through the Lee household during the \ncourse of nine years. The usual complement of domestic help was one non-resident \nmanservant (mainly to look after the horses, animals and land), one co-resident \nmaidservant and one live-in nurse girl to help with the almost permanent baby. The \nhousehold never specifically employed a cook, but occasionally hired the services of a \nwasherwoman, charwoman or monthly nurse. In the final year of the diary a governess \nwas taken on for the education of some of the sons.  \n \nDespite being the only daughter and eldest child, and with no other commitments of any \nkind, according to her diary entries Elizabeth devoted a surprisingly small amount of time \nto domestic duties. Her main responsibilities throughout the diary were to child mind \nwhen the servants or her mother were busy, and from time to time to help with cooking, \ncleaning or laundry. There is no evidence to suggest that these activities were performed \non a regular basis.\n40\n Elizabeth expressed enjoyment and pride in undertaking some of \nthese domestic roles. This was most notably the case between April 1885 and March \n1889 when, after having been taught to bake by a servant, she frequently recorded \n 20 \nspending time in the kitchen with the servant girl of her own age. She appeared to choose \nto spend time baking bread, pastry and occasionally cakes, often on a weekly basis. \nElizabeth only mildly complained about this role when her cooking did not turn out \nsuccessfully or when she felt overworked, as in this example from 1887: \u201eBaked today. \nHad a very busy day as Ma had to go out to see about a servant and Mary [the other \nservant] was washing, so had to mind the babies as well as bake.\u201f41  \n \nComplaints about domestic roles were much more frequent and bitter when the duties \nthat Elizabeth\u201fs parents placed on her prevented her from undertaking other activities that \nwere one-off and that she considered more enjoyable. These complaints were usually \nengendered by the expectation that she should help with cleaning or laundry. This \noccurred when her mother was unwell or confined by childbirth, or when a young or ill \nbrother required care, as in this example from 1885: \u201eIt is very wet this evening, and I had \nto stop at home because of that precious baby. Wrote a long letter to Miss Beale [a close \nfriend].\u201f42 On other occasions additional labour was needed to perform housework either \nduring the annual spring clean or during domestic crises when the Lees were left without \na servant, as this entry from 1890 suggests: \u201eOur nurse-girl had to go out again (to her \nbrother\u201fs funeral) so had to stay in all day.\u201f43 Elizabeth frequently complained of being \ntired when she had been required to undertake domestic work and the fact that she \nrecorded such events as abnormal and intrusive indicates that for most of the time her \ncommitment to domestic duties was low. \n \n 21 \nAlthough Elizabeth undertook a number of domestic duties (often related to her personal \nneeds), and from time to time assisted her mother and the servants with larger tasks, \noverall her domestic commitments were not onerous. She often expressed approval at the \nacquisition of modern labour-saving devices, including a sewing machine, washing \nmachine and new oven. Elizabeth considered such investments, as well as the frequent \nextensions and refurbishments of the house, to be subject to her father\u201fs authority, which \nsometimes led to conflict with his wife.\n44\n Like Elizabeth, her father was an additional \nsource of labour to be called upon for certain tasks during spring cleaning, house \nimprovements and servant crises. Yet he, even more than his daughter, left the everyday \ntasks of maintaining the home, in which he took considerable pride, to his wife.      \n \nElizabeth was usually left with plenty of time to pursue other activities. Some of these \ntook place at home, such as reading, writing letters and socialising with visiting friends.\n45\n \nHowever, it is revealing to note how few of her leisure activities were pursued within her \nparents\u201f house. The home formed an important part of Elizabeth\u201fs everyday routines, was \nthe site of most of her interaction with her mother and brothers, and she adopted roles \nthat allowed her to conform to some aspects of idealised femininity. However, she \nseldom prioritised domestic activities and whenever possible avoided them in favour of \nother pleasures that took place outside of the domestic sphere. In contrast to the options \navailable to older married women, young single suburban woman were offered both the \nprescriptive and, most importantly, the practical opportunities to centre their identities on \nactivities and relationships that stretched beyond the domestic.   \n \n 22 \nFAMILY, FRIENDS AND LOVE \nIn discussing the \u201ewoman question\u201f in The suburbans of 1905, T.W.H. Crosland \ndeclared:  \n \nIt is a singular but nevertheless instructive fact that we owe pretty well the whole \nof the morbid movements and discussions of the past half-century to the delicate \ngenius of Suburbia. Women\u201fs rights were first broached, and bloomers first worn, \nin Suburbia. \u201cIs marriage a failure?\u201d was an exceedingly bitter cry out of the sick \nmarried soul of Suburbia.\u201f46  \n \nFor this writer and commentator, suburbia and demands for greater legal, political and \nsocial opportunities for women were part of a single movement. This section explores the \nways in which Elizabeth sought to challenge or reinforce the conventions of middle-class \nsuburban society. \n \nThere is no evidence in the diary that Elizabeth took any interest in the public and \nfeminist campaigns that Crosland associated with suburbia. She recorded that her father \nsupported the Conservative party during the 1885 election, but she expressed no opinions \nabout political or philanthropic concerns of the 1880s and 1890s.\n47\n Elizabeth valued the \nfew months\u201f education that she had received at a newly-opened girls\u201f school and some of \nher female friends gained more substantial experience of pioneering girls\u201f high schools \nand even at Cambridge, but there is no indication that she viewed these opportunities as \nthe result of wider feminist campaigns. Those few female friends who were forced to \n 23 \nenter paid employment as dressmakers, governesses or shop assistants were regarded \nwith pity, and there is no evidence that she ever considered employment to be a \nfavourable choice for middle-class young women. In these respects, Elizabeth showed no \nawareness of the legal and political campaigns that were germinating amongst some \nwomen growing up in other more elite and educated, often metropolitan, suburban \nhomes.\n48\n    \n \nInstead, it was through her personal relationships with peers that Elizabeth exhibited \nbehaviour that could be interpreted as more fundamentally challenging to middle-class \nsuburban conventions. She sought first and foremost to appear fashionable and modern. \nThese aspirations were clearly influenced by her young male and female friends, whose \ncompany she often prioritised over that of her parents.  \n \nElizabeth\u201fs relatives are shadowy rather than central figures in the narrative recorded in \nher diary. She spent a good deal of time with her mother, but this was principally due to \ntheir joint domestic duties, rather than through leisure time that they chose to share. An \nentry from 1886 suggests they way in which Elizabeth on occasion and especially in her \nlate-teenage years missed the company of her mother: \n \nWent to L\u201fpool today. Wanted Ma to come with me but she would\u201fnt. I wanted her \nbecause I was going to by a hat. I got one at Compton House but it was very dear \nand I\u201fm sure Ma won\u201ft like it when it comes home. I never can buy a hat for \n 24 \nmyself. I always get it too dear or something and I can\u201ft afford it just now. I wish \nMa had come with me.\n49\n \n \nThe vast majority of references to Mrs Lee in the diary relate to the working relationship \nthat was formed in the often fraught setting of the negotiation of roles between mother, \ndaughter and the ever-changing cast of servants. This perhaps reflects the extent to which \nthis older married woman\u201fs life was consumed by the demands of suburban domesticity \nand maternity.  \n \nElizabeth\u201fs father was also occupied for long hours in his shops and sometimes travelling \non business, but evidence in the diary suggests that Elizabeth was emotionally closer to \nher \u201ePa\u201f. Not only did he encourage his only daughter to read, including discussing with \nher books that they had both read, but he also seemed to welcome Elizabeth\u201fs frequent \nvisits to his shops. Sometimes this was to help to serve customers in the gentleman\u201fs \noutfitters, occasionally she used the sewing machines to make her own clothes, but more \noften Elizabeth just dropped in for tea when she was passing through Birkenhead. The \nmale shop assistants were clearly an attraction, but she also called there to see her father. \nVisits to this primarily male space became part of her everyday routine and it was \narguably a more significant location in shaping her relationship with her father than was \nthe home.  \n \n 25 \nDuring 1888 one of the shops also became part of Elizabeth\u201fs wider social space as Mr \nLee allowed her to use an upstairs room to organise dances with friends, and on one \ntypical visit in preparation for these occasions she recorded how:   \n \nWent to L\u201fpool. Had tea at the Shop, and then we had a dance up in our ballroom \nto show some of the fellows [the shop assistants] how to dance. The 2 \nHeathcock\u201fs [both female friends] came. We had such fun. So tired.50  \n \nFriendships were hugely significant to Elizabeth in shaping her activities, preferences and \nidentity as a young, single woman.  The diary records friendships that were sustained \nover a period of at least several months with 27 women and 18 men, and the wide circle \nof male and female companions with whom she socialised was constantly changing \nduring the diary. Her friendships were formed, without exception, with others from \nbroadly middle-class backgrounds. Although some of her companions were close \nneighbours, family friends and cousins, and latterly the oldest of her brothers sometimes \nsocialised with her, many of her acquaintances came from elsewhere on Merseyside and \nmost were not known to her family.  \n \nAccording to Elizabeth\u201fs record in her diary, her father or mother rarely raised serious \nobjections to any of her friends or activities. At the beginning of the diary when Elizabeth \nwas relatively young there were a small number of occasions when she was reprimanded \nfor getting home late or when she noted that her father stopped her going out. For \ninstance, in 1888 her father initially voiced no objection to her attendance at a ball in the \n 26 \nAssembly Rooms in Liverpool but later retracted this permission because \u201eSomebody has \nbeen telling Pa that it is not a fit place for me to go\u201f.51 Elizabeth was furious on this \noccasion because many of her friends were going and it is clear from the diary that she \nfrequently circumvented such restrictions by not telling her parents what she was doing.  \n \nElizabeth frequently travelled alone to Liverpool to meet male friends. For instance, at \nthe age of nineteen she was quite prepared to wait on her own, and in fact fruitlessly, for \nan hour at Central Station in Liverpool for a young man with whom she frequently went \nout:  \n \nTonight I went down to the \u201cCentral Station to meet (Mr. Duncan) at 7. p.m. but \nhowever I waited till nearly 8. and could see no signs of him, so at last had to \ncome home again. I can hardly believe that I have not seen him. There must \nsurely something have prevented him coming. I just feel dreadful and have been \nnearly crying my eyes out. for I suppose I shall never see him any more now and I \nhad such a lovely card that I was going to give him. I had the greatest bother in \nthe world to get out as Pa came home and we were very busy in the Library, \nwhich we are trying to get ready for Xmas.\n52\n \n \nOn this occasion she was upset at being stood up, especially as she had difficulty \nnegotiating her absence from home, but she indicated no sense of fear when travelling \nand waiting alone in Liverpool on what must have been a dark evening in December. The \nconflicting demands of family and friendships could lead to such tensions, but for most of \n 27 \nthe period of the diary her parents were rarely recorded as interfering with, or in fact \nbeing aware of, her social life and friendship networks.  \n \nIn addition to group activities such as dances and other outings, Elizabeth had a number \nof close female friends on whom she regularly called and many male friends who she \nmet, often apparently by chance. Walks were a favourite activity, such as on this Sunday \nin 1886:  \n \nWent to Church this morning. Went to the \u201cwoods\u201d for a walk this afternoon. Met \nMr. W. there quite accidentally. Such a long time since I have seen him. We went a \nwalk through the woods. Stopped at home tonight. Nice weather.\n53\n \n \nAlthough on this occasion Elizabeth was genuinely surprised to see her intermittent \nboyfriend, she frequently used evening walks in the local neighbourhood as a means to \nmeet male and female friends. Meetings with boyfriends were often pre-arranged or at \nleast hoped for, and two years later she described going to Birkenhead to reprimand the \nsame young architect for his failure to come out to the suburb to see her: \u201eHad a talk with \nMr. W. in his office and gave him a good blowing up for not coming up to see me or \nanything.\u201f54   \n \nMarriage was taken for granted by most as an essential part of middle-class femininity.\n55\n \nElizabeth was aware of such social expectations and amongst her New Year aspirations \nfor 1885 were \u201eTo marry a man for his worth\u201f and \u201eTo be a helpmate to a husband\u201f.56 \n 28 \nThere is every indication that Elizabeth expected to marry and she frequently watched \nlocal weddings. However, she also expressed reservations about the demands and dangers \nfaced by wives. In 1891 after a friend was \u201eat death\u201fs door\u201f following childbirth she \ncommented \u201eCatch me getting married\u201f.57  \n \nAlthough Elizabeth had many male friends with whom she socialised, there were three \nlong-term relationships during the course of the diary in which she explicitly recorded \ndiscussing marriage (at least two other relationships were sufficiently serious to generate \nlove letters but about these she made no mention of possible marriage). One of the \npotential marriage partners, a family friend and childhood sweetheart, was discouraged as \na serious relationship by Elizabeth\u201fs parents; one (probably the most intense) was broken \noff when the man decided to travel overseas; and one \u2013 who made frequent visits to the \nhouse and seemed the most formally accepted into her family \u2013 ended the relationship \npossibly because his parents objected. Although parental involvement in casual \nfriendships and romances was minimal, parents did have a significant impact once a \nrelationship moved towards formal engagement.  \n \nPrior to this, however, Elizabeth was prepared to take the initiative by following young \nmen who she liked, deliberately going where she knew she might meet them or calling on \nthem directly. For instance, in 1888 she recorded how she changed her plans because \u201eAs \nI was going to Church tonight met J.S.A. We went a walk instead of going to Church. \nWent in Straw Shed. Had such fun.\u201f58 She also occasionally accompanied male suitors to \ntheir lodgings, as on this occasion after a music hall dance in 1891: \u201eCame away about \u00bd \n 29 \npast one. a.m. and went home with J.S.A. (went to his lodgings first) went home with him \nin a cab. I have enjoyed myself.\u201f59 Even when Elizabeth was apparently going out \nregularly with a long-term suitor, she would often meet with other male friends and \nsometimes flirt or \u201espoon\u201f with them. Sensual and physical relationships with serious \nboyfriends appeared to be taken for granted and, according to Elizabeth\u201fs record, her \nfriends had equally active love lives.  \n \nElizabeth did not express any feelings of dissatisfaction or unease with the moral and \nemotional codes that she expected to follow. Although her parents were aware of many of \nher romantic attachments, only very rarely did male friends come to the Lee\u201fs home. \nMore often they hung around in the neighbourhood and then said goodnight on the \ndoorstep, met at an event or place at an appointed hour, or saw each other only at friends\u201f \nhouses or on holidays without parents. It is revealing to note that socialising with female \nfriends also predominantly took place outside of the Lees\u201f home. More than two-thirds of \ndomestic meetings for tea or supper occurred at friends\u201f homes, and much socialising \ntook place at public events, on outings to Liverpool and further afield, or on walks. \nWhether this was because Elizabeth felt uncomfortable in her home that was crowded \nwith younger brothers or because she expected a degree of disapproval from her parents \nis hard to tell. Nonetheless, Elizabeth\u201fs ability to move relatively freely around rural, \nsuburban and urban landscapes offered crucial space, independence and privacy \u2013 all in \nshort supply in a home full of small boys \u2013 to develop personal relationships. \n \n 30 \nNot only was the independence of young single middle-class women facilitated by \nnascent suburban infrastructure and protected from many of the everyday demands of \nmarried domesticity, but they also expected to follow a distinctly youthful code of \nbehaviour. Although far from active or radical in her abstract political or social concerns, \nElizabeth\u201fs personal conduct and friendships did fit with much of the, frequently \ncondemned,  conduct of the \u201eNew Woman\u201f. Her activities, language, dress and \nrelationships were distinctly modern and, in some cases, deliberately pushing at \nboundaries of conventional acceptability. However, there is rarely any indication in \nElizabeth\u201fs diary that such behaviour was considered unacceptable by her parents or \nothers within the suburban community. Within this restricted circle of single, middle-\nclass people whose lives were centred on the suburb, young women were expected to \nenjoy a relatively high degree of autonomy in choosing activities, companions and \nboyfriends. The presumed safety of the space and respectability of the people thus \nenabled the creation of distinct codes of young single \u201emodern\u201f femininity within a \nsuburban community.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nIn The condition of England Crosland described suburbia as follows: \u201eIt is a life of \nSecurity; a life of Sedentary occupation; a life of Respectability; and these three qualities \ngive the key to its special characteristics.\u201f60 Elizabeth Lee\u201fs diary suggests that these \nqualities were ones that her family sought and in many ways the Lees were an archetypal \nlate-nineteeenth-century middle-class suburban family. Elizabeth\u201fs father was a respected \nbusiness man, a member of the local Masonic Lodge and politically Conservative. He \n 31 \nowned a large house with adjacent land and, together with his wife, invested time and \nlabour in maintaining and improving their household that included at least three servants. \nThe residents of the emerging suburb of Prenton established public activities and social \nnetworks that allowed the creation of a \u201ecommunity\u201f of suburbanites who considered \nthemselves to be alike.  \n \nElizabeth Lee also valued and contributed to the creation of this social and physical \nlandscape. Detailed examination of her everyday life suggests that she did not openly \nchallenge any of the tenets of Victorian suburban living or of respectable young \nwomanhood but, through her actions, Elizabeth (and her contemporaries on Merseyside) \nwere able to mould these structures to the shapes that suited them. The relationship \nbetween young people and the older generation who had chosen to inhabit suburbia was \none of neither open rebellion nor total acquiescence. Instead, it was one of negotiated \nfreedoms within boundaries that the young were sometimes themselves able to ignore, \nshift or remake. Familial and domestic responsibilities were deliberately limited; the \nperceived safety of the environment and the availability of public transport encouraged \nindependent mobility; the public social life of the suburb flourished through the \ncontributions of the time and money of the young; and friendships were conducted \nprimarily outside of the oversight of parents.  The space of late-nineteenth-century \nsuburbia \u2013 as a site of on-going development, modernity and malleable norms \u2013 thus \noffered its young elite residents opportunities for a certain degree of social, cultural and \nmaterial autonomy and authority that was understood to be essential to the life of the \nnascent suburb.   \n 32 \n \nThis paper can offer no more than the account of the life of one individual, with passing \nreferences to friends and acquaintances. It is hard to assess the typicality of evidence \nculled from a single diary and the rarity of such evidence makes systematic comparison \ndifficult. There is no indication that the lives of Elizabeth\u201fs friends were in any way \ndifferent from her own and she was happy to talk about, and share, her activities with \nthem. In this sense her behaviour seemed to be the norm for the community.  However, it \ncannot be suggested that the strategies adopted by Elizabeth and her friends were \nnecessarily the same as those in generations that went before and after her or, indeed, in \nother localities or more wealthy homes at the same time. The youthful independence of \nwomen was partly the result of the restricted means of lower middle-class families such \nas the Lees, who could not afford paid chaperones, who did not employ enough servants \nto free Mrs Lee from domestic duties and whose financial survival depended on Mr Lee\u201fs \nintimate involvement in the day-to-day running of his shops. The firmly provincial nature \nof the Merseyside community in which Elizabeth grew up was also significant. The \ninhabitants of such suburbs had no direct contact with the national intellectual, political \nand social elite, whose lives were often centred on London, and whose writings and \nexperiences primarily created what was understood to be the \u201enational\u201f prescriptive and \nfictional literature. It is thus not surprising that the experiences of young women living in \nthe suburbs surrounding London and the Home Counties were bounded by a quite \ndifferent set of geographical, social, cultural and personal expectations to those which \ninfluenced the lives of young provincial women. \n \n 33 \nThe relatively small, affluent and flexible nascent suburb of the late-nineteenth century \nwas also a very different entity to the large-scale, mass and embedded suburb of the mid-\ntwentieth century. By this date the ways in which women should inhabit and interpret \nsuburban domesticity were widely espoused in popular magazines, advertisements, films \nand novels that were seen and read nationally by the majority of women of all ages.\n61\n \nMoreover, an increasingly wide range of educational opportunities, professional careers, \nand respectable domestic labour in homes that sought to reduce their reliance on servants \nbecame available to middle-class young women.\n62\n As a result, the entirely unscheduled \nand unregulated free time of late-nineteenth-century young women became increasingly \nrare and indeed widely condemned. Simultaneously, as suburbia grew increasingly \nexpansive, well-established and socially mixed, and as its married residents enjoyed more \nholidays and \u201eleisure\u201f time, it would be surprising if a later generation of young women \nhad the same degree of mobility, autonomy and authority in creating the social life of the \nsuburb. The suburban modernity inhabited by Elizabeth Lee was thus the product of a \nvery specific time, place and class.  \n \nThese suburban pioneers constructed their own social environment, but they also left a \nlegacy for future generations. Many of the churches, sporting associations, music halls, \nlecture rooms, shops and public transport routes that had been established to meet the \ndemands of the first generation of suburban young women continued to be used by later \ngenerations, even as the educational and occupational horizons of some expanded beyond \nthe suburbs. However, the vast suburban homes and gardens to which late-nineteenth-\ncentury middle-class married couples aspired were more rapidly rejected by the small, \n 34 \nnuclear servant-less families of the following century. As a result, the Lee family home \nand those of many of their neighbours were demolished in the 1930s.  \n \nNevertheless, the memory of their villa suburbia was not lost. Within the second-\ngeneration \u2013 and strikingly different \u2013 suburb of semi-detached houses constructed on the \nLee\u201fs land is a Wharfedale Road. Alongside the surnames of some of Elizabeth\u201fs friends \nand neighbours, the name of the Lee\u201fs house lives on as an interwar suburban street that \nreplaced the homes of the pioneer suburbanites of the 1880s. \n 35 \nLIST OF REFERENCES \nS.
