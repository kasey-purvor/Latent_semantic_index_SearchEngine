Manufacturing companies are generating an increasing proportion of\ntheir revenue through service. This recognition of the increasing importance of service led to the development\nof the servitization paradigm, in which products and services are offered to customers as an integrated\npackage: servitization is considered as a position where product and service are inseparable (Morelli 2002).\nPSS, as a special case of servitization (Baines et al., 2008) focuses on the combination of products and\nservices to deliver customer value.\nCompanies who design and manufacture products are uniquely able to apply their in-depth engineering\nknowledge to the variety of customer applications. This in-depth product knowledge also gives them a\nsignificant advantage in offering maintenance and repair services. The compelling business case for offering\nservices as an addition to products is strongly linked to the significantly higher profit margins available in\ndownstream, or customer facing, operations (Wise, 1999).\nThere are few studies on the impact of a PSS business strategy on the product-and-service design strategy. It\nis recognised in literature that it is not sufficient to simply design products and add service: system level\ndesign is necessary (Aurich et al., 2006).\nA key challenge in the development of technical products is managing product data. Because managing\nproduct data is such a challenge, particularly in a life cycle context, the design process and resulting business\nmodel of engineering companies is often centred on the \u2018master product model\u2019 concept. Since we have\nidentified that products and services are required to be designed in concert, and that organisations are\nincreasingly focused on the delivery of service, this business model must be scrutinised in light of the\ndeveloping PSS paradigm. PSS design includes not only integrated product-and-service design but also\nbusiness process design: the company who developed the PSS must also develop and implement the systems\nto deliver it.\nIntegrated Technical Product-Service System (t-PSS) design will rely on a structured approach to the\ndevelopment of the product and service. This includes the requirement to adapt the master product model\nconcept in light of the PSS design challenge. This requirement is considered here in terms of knowledge\nreuse: how can company knowledge, in particular product models, manufacturing methods, and service\nmethods, be represented in such a way that supports the change in focus required as a result of the emerging\nPSS design challenge?\nThis paper describes the development of an integrated knowledge management framework to support PSS\ndesign. The framework is demonstrated using examples from a detailed case study.\nLiterature review\nThis section describes the theoretical underpinning of this research from the following categories: design\nknowledge reuse, manufacturing capability, and PSS design.\n1.1. Design knowledge reuse\nIn order to briefly describe the context of this project, some references to knowledge management literature\nwill be made. The paradigm of \u2018knowledge reuse\u2019 makes various assumptions, including a technocratic view\nof knowledge management (Earl 2001) with codification as the primary focus (Hansen et al., 1999). It is\nfurther assumed that the development of mature products can effectively rely upon explicit knowledge\ncommunicated through information systems (Hansen et al., 1999).\nIn previous work, we developed a method to reuse engineering design knowledge (Baxter et al., 2007). Three\nknowledge types were supported: process knowledge, product knowledge, and task knowledge. The design\nprocess made reference to the product model at the activity level. The process based design knowledge reuse\nmethod provides project guidance and monitoring, a framework to organise information and knowledge\nretrieval, and a central repository of product data. This framework will be adapted and extended to take\naccount of design, manufacturing and service knowledge in a PSS design context.\n1.2. Manufacturing capability research\nManufacturing capability research can be considered in two categories: strategy level and operations level.\nStrategy level manufacturing capability research is concerned with issues such as production capacity and\norganisational strategy. Operations level manufacturing capability research addresses capability at the\nmachine level, and often refers to Statistical Process Control (SPC \u2013 see, for example, Yu et al., 2005;\nMotorcu & G\u00fcll\u00fc 2006; Gijo 2005). The manufacturing case study in this research is aimed at operations level\ncapability, and in particular, machining capability. In machining capability research, feedback to design is not\nwell addressed. Manufacturing process planning research is largely focused on the development of automated\nsolutions (e.g. Yongtao & Jingying 2006; Aziz & Chassapis 2005). Whilst automation saves time in\nexecution, the detailed knowledge capture exercise associated with knowledge based systems is an expensive\nprocess, applicable only in large companies (Yoo & Kim 2002).\nManufacturing process planning is also relevant, as a key consideration in product development. For a\ndescription of computer aided process planning, see (Culler & Burd 2007). There is some conflict in applying\nprocess planning systems at the conceptual stage of design, due to the high level of detail required for CAPP\nand the lack of standard frameworks for manual process planning to support the reuse of manufacturing\nmethods. Our research indicates that industry practice in machining process planning still relies on manual\nprocesses. As such, we are advocating a lightweight knowledge management method that provides knowledge\nof best practices with minimal implementation and maintenance effort.\n1.3. Service knowledge research\nService is a core element of PSS design. There are few formal approaches to service knowledge capture and\nreuse available in the literature, indicating that it is a developing area. Current developments in service and\nmaintenance literature are tending towards intelligent monitoring: prognostics and health management, which\ncombines monitoring (Masri et al, 2004; Yao & Warren, 2005) with computational methods (Dunsdon et al,\n2008) and algorithmic analysis in an integrated framework (Lee et al, 2006) to optimise maintenance\nintervention. This predictive maintenance and intelligent service management does not take account of\nnormative practices (Scandura et al. 2004) such as crew checklists in aircraft. It also does not include design\nfeedback mechanisms.\n1.4. PSS Design Research\nThe developing PSS research field shows that within an integrated product-service system, the product,\nservice and business model need to be developed in an integrated fashion.\nBaines et al (2008) discuss the state of the art in PSS, stating that a PSS is \u201can integrated product and service\noffering that delivers value in use\u201d. They suggest that a successful PSS needs to be designed from a client\nperspective, at the system level. They also suggest that organisational structures of PSS providers must change\nin order to support PSS delivery. They conclude that there is currently limited guidance for PSS design and\ndelivery. Tukker and Tischner (2006) also propose that new business models are a key element of PSS, and\nthat careful design of the PSS is required. Evans et al. (2007) found that the producer must play a key role in\nProduct-Service System design, whilst also working closely with other supply chain members. This is due to\nthe producer having intimate knowledge of design and of high volume manufacturing. They investigated 10\ncompanies in the food industry. Morelli (2002) suggests that PSS design must develop methods to take\naccount of shifts in cultural norms, and that improved methods to represent services are required.\nThe life cycle oriented technical service design method (Aurich et al., 2004) was later modified to incorporate\nPSS concepts (Aurich et al., 2006). This method proposes an integrated, systematic approach to product and\nservice design. They suggest an integrated process model that applies processes from a library. Their methods\ndo not indicate how to reuse PSS knowledge and information. Tukker and Mont also emphasise the need to\nfocus on the system perspective in PSS design (Mont & Tukker 2006).\nThe key message of PSS design research to date is that a PSS design methodology is required to support two\nkey elements: conceptualisation of the PSS itself and of the supporting business model. Existing design\nmethodologies and tools are recognised to have a potential contribution to PSS design, however they must be\nmodified or extended to properly reflect the PSS design problem. It is not the intention of this research to\ndevelop a PSS design methodology, rather to develop a framework that supports knowledge reuse in a t-PSS\ndesign scenario. The framework must therefore support product, service and business model design.\n1.5. Knowledge structure for PSS modelling\nKnowledge modelling enables the efficient interchange of data relating throughout the system life cycle.\nVarious models have been proposed, such as the manufacturing knowledge model developed by Guerra-\nZubiaga and Young (2008). Robust, web-based technical solutions to data exchange include ontology models.\nYe et al. (2008) demonstrate an ontology for integrating supply chain management activities. As this research\nprogressed and uncovered the emerging requirements of PSS, it was identified that they would have a\nsignificant impact on the structure of the knowledge reuse framework. The challenge of PSS design includes\nthe co-development of products, services and business models. As such, a product centric structure (e.g.\nYoung et al., 2007, Guerra-Zubiaga and Young, 2008) is no longer appropriate. There are some exceptions to\nthis: in very large scale products such as ships, a significant part of the life cycle management challenge is\nconfiguration management. In this large-single-product environment, a central product model is an\nappropriate structure for PSS management. In smaller scale products such as vacuum pumps, several hundred\npumps may be installed at a single customer site. The range of products in place and the range of applications\neach product is applied to results in a need to focus at the broader \u2018system\u2019 level in order to effectively\nmanage the PSS life cycle.\nThree classes are commonly applied as an upper level structure for both product- and software- development\nmodelling purposes: Product, Process and Resource (PPR). Maropoulos et al (2002) apply the PPR classes to\na manufacturing planning problem: integrating design and manufacturing. Chandra and Kamrani (2003) apply\nthe PPR classes to a knowledge management framework to support product design in an extended enterprise\nscenario. Both methods extend the PPR class structure in order to support detailed descriptions of additional\ndomains such as design, manufacturing, and maintenance. Huang and Mak (1999) describe the need to\nintegrate PPR in a design (concurrent engineering) activity. In each case, the application of PPR classes\nenables a range of activities and items to be described in order to support product design. The methods do not\nappear to support service- or organisation- design.\nThe original application of the three PPR classes appears to come from computer science. Fenton (1991) made\nreference to them in his 1991 book on software metrics. The widespread adoption of CAD systems, plus the\nintroduction of product data management (PDM) systems contribute towards the need to formalise product\ndescriptions. Concurrent engineering, and in particular computer applications to support it, brings about the\nneed to describe the downstream activities (processes and resources) that constitute the domain of interest.\nSoftware models of design processes and artefacts require a structured description of the constituent elements\nin a way that is easily transferred to a software system. The direct application of a software modelling\napproach makes sense from the perspective that: since it will be described using a software system, the\ndescription method can directly apply software modelling methods.\nCase companies\nDuring this research project, three companies have been engaged at varying levels. Each company will be\ndescribed in terms of their products and markets, their approach to design, and their maturity with respect to\nPSS.\nCompany 1 are a manufacturer of vacuum pumps for a variety of industrial applications. Their principal\nmarket is the semiconductor industry, within which many critical processes operate in a vacuum and require\nprocess gas removal. The nature of the semiconductor industry brings two conflicting requirements: ultra high\nreliability due to the high expectation of the technologically advanced industry and the high value of\nsemiconductors, coupled with the ability to cope with aggressive chemicals and materials involved in\nsemiconductor manufacturing and equipment cleaning processes. Design is very much technically driven:\nengineering knowledge is highly regarded in this company. Historically, the key focus in the design process\nhas been the engineering phase. Recently, the new product introduction (NPI) process is taking account of an\nincreasing amount of downstream requirements from the conceptual design stage, engaging engineers and\nCAD designers directly with manufacturing and service personnel. Service accounts for approximately 50%\nof total revenue. Product sales have historically been separate from service sales, and this remains the case for\nsmall customers. The current strategy with larger customers is to offer integrated pump management\nsolutions, in which products are sold alongside a service and maintenance package. Integrated pump\nmanagement systems are operated via network connections to each pump within a customer site. Pricing\nstructures and product design strategies remain \u2018product plus service\u2019 however the integrated nature of the\ncurrent sales strategy and the availability of advanced product management reflects a significant move\ntowards PSS.\nCompany 2 are providers of machine tools. Currently they offer lathes, grinding machines and vertical and\nhorizontal machining centres. The company has grown through acquisition. A selection of their machine tools\nare manufactured in-house, however several of their product lines are manufactured by external companies.\nThey currently operate in the low to medium price range, typically selling to small-to-medium enterprises\n(SMEs). The nature of flexible machining centres means that they serve a variety of manufacturing\napplications. Product design for the outsourced machines takes place at the supplier. The company provides\nrequirements specification and participates in design review activities. Product sales are generally separate\nfrom service sales, however the company do offer technical support for new customers from process\noptimisation to a full \u2018turnkey package\u2019 including the machine, fixture, and NC code for a given component.\nThey do not offer remote product monitoring. Their separate service and product sales strategy positions them\nas a traditional manufacturing company rather than a PSS provider.\nCompany 3 are a large aerospace manufacturer. They design and manufacture aero engines for military and\ncivil applications. Their sales strategy in the civil sector is increasingly focused on a leasing model in which\nairlines pay a fixed price for every hour the engine is operating. This is having a significant impact on the\nmechanical aspects of product design through the approach to life cycle cost analysis. It has also influenced\nthe systems element: advanced engine health management is now a key activity within the company. Sensor\nsystems indicate engine health. They must be integrated with the business systems, including supply chain\nmanagement to ensure optimal maintenance expenditure. With respect to PSS, company 3 are considered as a\nleading figure. The scale and complexity of their products and the current organisation of the business means\nthat the gradual shift from a product focused business to a service focused business is having a major impact.\nResearch Methodology\nA case study approach was adopted in this research. According to Gerring and McDermott (2007), the case\nstudy approach represents an analysis in which one or a few units are studied in detail in order to provide\ninsight to a broader class of units. In this research, the units are all manufacturing organisations developing\nmature, complex electro-mechanical products. The intention is to study these organisations in order to develop\nan understanding of current practice, and to use them as test cases for the knowledge framework proposal to\nsupport PSS design.\nKnowledge capture\nKnowledge capture was divided into three separate stages: design, manufacturing and service. Design\nknowledge capture involved a combination of interviews and secondary data describing the design process. In\ntotal, 5 interviews took place with senior designers, and a process model was developed to describe the \u2018as-is\u2019\ndesign process. The process model was developed iteratively, and validated by the designers.\nManufacturing knowledge capture took place using multiple methods. Approximately 30 interviews and 4\nworkshops were held in total. 3 days were spent observing the machining activity. Company documents\ndescribing materials, tooling, machining processes, design processes and quality systems were also used in\nunderstanding the existing company knowledge and in developing the framework. Four initial interviews were\ncarried out using the critical incident technique (Gremler, 2004). The primary question in this stage was\n\u201cFrom your experience, describe the most recent situation in which you either observed or experienced\nsomething that impressed you as an outstanding example of {positive, or effective; negative, or ineffective}\nbehaviour\u201d. The responses were subjected to a thematic analysis, which is \u201c\u2026a process for encoding\nqualitative information. The encoding requires an explicit \"code\"\u2026 A theme is a pattern found in the\ninformation\u2026\u201d (Boyatzis, 1998). In this example, notes taken during the interviews were analysed to identify\nkey terms. This analysis contributed to the development of an initial manufacturing knowledge framework.\nThe remaining interviews and workshops supported the development of the knowledge base content, structure\nand usage scenarios. Detailed descriptions of manufacturing processes (machining and inspection) were\ncaptured.\nService knowledge capture took place in two stages. The first stage included the development of an outline\nservice knowledge framework. For this stage, 10 semi-structured interviews took place with NPI personnel to\nidentify examples of service knowledge applied in design. A semi-structured interview approach was adopted.\nNotes were taken during the interviews, and the notes were subjected to thematic analysis. The themes were\napplied to a service knowledge framework proposal, which was validated with the participants. The second\nstage focused on the development of detailed service process examples. 10 interviews were held to identify\nknowledge applied in the field service activity. These interviews supported the creation of service process\ndescriptions.\nValidation took place in each case with the users. The integrated system was validated in a workshop format.\n1.6. Representing design (process) knowledge\nOne important element of design knowledge capture, particularly in the design of mature products, is process\nmodelling. A prescriptive design process model shows the best practice sequence of tasks which contribute\ntowards the creation of the final product. Figure 2 shows the design process model developed as a result of the\ncase study. The process notation refers to activities (square corners) and data sets (round corners). This\ndivision of task and data is applied according to the Design Roadmap method (Park & Cutkosky 1999). This\nenables the inclusion not only of task relevant knowledge, but also of any required input data. This modelling\napproach was applied to previous work on design knowledge reuse (Baxter et al., 2007).\nThe best practice design process was captured for a vacuum pump, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.\nThe process is divided into two main stages: conceptual and detailed design. The main focus of this work is\nconceptual design, however detailed design is also shown to indicate the resulting process flow. The\nconceptual design activity begins with the creation of a project team. In parallel, the requirements\nspecification, product family definition, module structure definition and service package design activities are\ncarried out. Service package design is currently carried out during the detailed design activity, however the\nrecognition of an integrated product and services sales strategy brought about the requirement to design the\nservice package concept at this early stage. This combination of tasks feeds into the engineering requirements\ndata set.\nFigure 1: roots-claw vacuum pump\nThe design process in Figure 2 represents a \u2018to-be\u2019 process. Various activities additional to current practice\nare proposed to better support PSS design. One such activity is manufacturability analysis, which could be\nformally applied at the early stages, providing an input to the performance modelling activity. Dry pumps rely\non very small clearances between rotors and stators in order to produce the highest possible vacuum.\nMachining tolerances are therefore critical in providing high performing and reliable pumps. The engineering\nrequirement includes a specification of pumping capacity, vacuum capability and expected power\nconsumption, which implies a machining tolerance requirement. Therefore, this model proposes a\nmanufacturing analysis activity to take place within the conceptual design stage in order to verify the\ncommercial validity of the project. Roughly speaking, smaller clearances result in conceptually superior\nproducts. When operating very close to the manufacturing capability threshold, smaller clearances also result\nin higher production costs through more costly manufacturing methods (e.g. boring vs. interpolating) and\nhigher scrap rates.\nFigure 2: design process model\nTwo service focused activities have also been added to the design process: service package design and service\nlocation decision. Conceptual level service package design takes place alongside the system requirements\nspecification. A detailed level service package design process is required as an addition to this model.\nAlongside manufacturing process design, service process design needs to take place. Since the knowledge\ncapture activity did not extend to service process design, it is not included in this version of the process.\nService knowledge capture is described in the next section.\n1.7. Representing manufacturing (machining and inspection) knowledge\nThe manufacturing knowledge capture activity took part in two phases: the first phase set out to identify a\nmanufacturing knowledge structure and to develop a prototype knowledge base. The second phase set out to\ncapture detailed examples and usage scenarios and to record them in the knowledge base. The detailed\nmanufacturing knowledge structure was developed to support three key activities: machining planning,\ninspection planning, and product design.\nGeometric features are applied to support the integration of manufacturing and design. STEP AP224 is used to\ndescribe machining features, including: boss; turned knurl; thread; marking; rib top; round hole; outside\nprofile; pocket; removal volume; revolved profile; outer round; flat face; protrusion; rounded end; slot;\nspherical cap; step; compound feature; replicate feature. STEP AP224 is also used to describe tolerances.\nGeometric tolerances include: angularity; circular runout; concentricity; cylindricity; flatness; parallelism;\nperpendicularity; position; roundness; straightness; surface profile; symmetry; and total runout. Dimensional\ntolerances include size and location.\nMachining and inspection planning processes are developed according to a component description. In design\nterms, the focus is often broader: if not product level then certainly module level. Feature level knowledge is\nalso very relevant in detailed design. Identifying relationships between these various levels is critical in\ndeveloping a support system that can be applied to multiple user groups.\nFor manufacturing engineers, a key support function is providing access to best practice machining methods.\nInitially, existing machining processes were captured and stored in the system in order to identify the required\ncontent. Geometric features were classified according to how they were applied in design through a series of\ninterviews and workshops. An investigation then took place to identify best practices according to these\nfeatures. The proposed method applies scaleable machining features with a range of sizes rather than a fixed\nsize. It also applies scaleable machining process descriptions, using surface speed and chip thickness in place\nof spindle rpm and feed rate. An example of a best practice machining feature, a dowel hole, is shown in\nFigure 3.\nFigure 3: example best practice feature - dowel hole\nThe tolerances associated with this best practice feature are presented according to two different processes:\nboring and reaming. The machining activities describe the reamed hole, however the tolerances also show a\nbored hole. The user is able to easily compare how the bored hole differs (better position tolerance; worse\ninside diameter tolerance).\nManufacturing processes at the component level are the second important interface for knowledge support in\nmanufacturing planning. The process shows the sequence of activities. Each activity shows the resource used:\nin a machining process this refers to the tool. Activity descriptions also include tooling data including chip\nthickness, surface speed, and spindle load. The ability to describe machining processes at the component level\nindependently from the feature level is necessary since component level (and multi-component fixture level)\noptimisation may indicate sub-optimal tooling for a given feature in order to optimise overall tool count.\n1.8. Service knowledge part 1: service in design\nFollowing a thematic analysis of notes taken during 10 semi-structured interviews, the service knowledge\nstructure shown in Figure 4 was proposed. The main categories are: tooling, spares, serviceability,\nmaintenance, and training. Knowledge from each of these categories is required in the NPI process.\nFigure 4: proposed service knowledge structure\nThe tooling category refers to tooling required to service the pumps in the field and at the service centre. New\nor special tooling required for a new product needs to be developed within the NPI project. Decisions taken\nregarding assembly and test methods must consider the service facilities. The volumes associated with\noriginal manufacture will always be higher than those at the service facility, since products made at a single\nmanufacturing location will be serviced at many service locations around the world due to the distributed\nnature of the service business. As such, optimal manufacturing methods (e.g. flow lines, dedicated\nautomation) may not be optimal for the lower volume service facility. Design decisions at this stage should\nseek to optimise whole life cost. Test systems have caused issues in the past, where automated test methods\nhave been applied to production. The design of the test method had not taken into account the lower volume\nof products being tested at the service centres. As a result, the decision to apply manual methods at the service\ncentres required the development of the test equipment and the test procedure.\nSpares are a designation for components available to the after-market as replacement parts. Spares definitions\nmay dictate that certain parts replacements are carried out in groups. For example, a single seal may only be\navailable as part of a kit. That kit may include several washers, seals \u2018o\u2019-rings or gaskets, according to the\nexpected requirement for a full or partial rebuild. Other rebuild parts kits may also be available, containing\nvarious wear parts according to the recommendation for parts which should be replaced as part of every\nproduct rebuild.\nServiceability is indicated through feedback from service personnel to designers. Feedback may include actual\ntime taken in the service process, problems encountered, ideas for improvement, and design change requests.\nWhilst design change requests have a formal feedback mechanism, there is not currently a method for\nproviding feedback of the other non-critical elements.\nMaintenance in this context refers to the maintenance processes and procedures. One such example, a test\nprocess, is shown in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a free, open source ontology editor developed by the Stanford Center for\nBiomedical Informatics Research. It is used as a knowledge-base framework for knowledge solutions in\nvarious communities, including biomedicine, intelligence gathering, and corporate modelling\n(http:\/\/protege.stanford.edu).\nFigure 5. Test procedures developed within the NPI process need to be developed according to the most\neconomically favourable test equipment. The calculation may differ according to regional differences for a\ngiven volume: lower labour cost may result in a higher preference for manual processes, whereas high labour\ncost may lead to a preference for automated processes.\nTraining refers to the requirements for procedures and documentation as well as project planning to support\nproduct launch. Documentation describing service and maintenance procedures is a key part of the training\nrequirement. Hands-on training also takes place: a service technician trained by the NPI team may travel to\nthe various service centres to train key personnel, or service technicians from the various global sites may\ntravel to a central location to receive hands-on training.\n1.9. Service knowledge part 2: service operations\nVarious service activities take place at customer sites: installation, maintenance, commissioning, exchange,\nproduct management and repair. Dedicated service centres carry out product maintenance and repair.\nThe context of the second stage of service knowledge capture was \u2018service knowledge applied in service\noperations\u2019. The knowledge capture activity took place through a series of interviews with service centre\npersonnel. The outcome of these interviews was twofold: first, the knowledge structure described in Figure 4\nwas examined and extended to take account of their knowledge requirements. Second, a process modelling\nactivity took place to represent a selection of processes carried out in the service environment. An example\nprocess (a product test process in a service centre), described using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 knowledge base editor tool, is\nshown in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a free, open source ontology editor developed by the Stanford Center for Biomedical\nInformatics Research. It is used as a knowledge-base framework for knowledge solutions in various\ncommunities, including biomedicine, intelligence gathering, and corporate modelling\n(http:\/\/protege.stanford.edu).\nFigure 5. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a free, open source ontology editor developed by the Stanford Center for Biomedical\nInformatics Research. It is used as a knowledge-base framework for knowledge solutions in various\ncommunities, including biomedicine, intelligence gathering, and corporate modelling\n(http:\/\/protege.stanford.edu).\nFigure 5: Partial service (test) process represented in the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 system\nFramework development\nIn developing the PSS knowledge framework, the results of the design, manufacturing and service knowledge\ncapture activities were combined with the findings from the literature study. The review of the literature\nshowed that PSS design requires an integrated approach; this was a central consideration in the development\nof the integrated framework.\nThe first activity was to develop a strategy and upper level structure suitable for modelling PSS. Following\nthat, a detailed level ontology could be developed to represent the content and relationships of the specific\ndomain knowledge. This will be described using examples developed in the case study. Figure 7 shows the\nupper level PSS structure that enables the description of a combined product- and business- system (Baxter et\nal., 2008).\nFigure 6: life cycle system structure\nThe upper level class \u2018life cycle system\u2019 indicates the combination of business model, product, and service.\nThe reference to \u2018life cycle\u2019 (rather than simply PSS) indicates the \u2018through life management\u2019 challenge. A\nlife cycle system can be described at any level of abstraction, from the overall PSS (e.g. an availability\ncontract at a customer site with 200 pumps installed) to a subset of that system: a product in use, a\nmaintenance team, or a service facility, for example. The life cycle system view also enables any given stage\nin a product life cycle to be described: conception, design, use, maintenance, disposal, and so on. At the\ndetailed level, the configuration of the system structure will differ according to the specific needs of a given\nindustry, supply chain, or organisation.\nOntology development\nUsing life cycle system as a central class, the structure shown in Figure 7 was proposed for modelling a PSS\nin order to provide product- and service- design support. This has been developed with reference to a\ntechnical PSS, in which detailed descriptions of design, manufacturing and service are required. The technical\nsystem used in the development and validation of this model is a system of vacuum pumps installed at a\ncustomer site operated according to an operations contract which indicates an overall level of availability (i.e.\n99.97%). There are various pump, customer and process types to consider. Decisions on replacement stock\nlevels and installation of slave systems with automatic switching are made by the vacuum service provider.\nFigure 7: integrated knowledge framework structure\nThe central class \u2018life cycle system\u2019 is principally comprised of three classes: product, process and resource.\nThe system also comprises various descriptive classes: requirements, behaviour, logistics, operating methods,\nand installation environment. The requirements at the system level are comprised of service features\n(Doultsinou et al., 2008), which are defined as \u2018attributes of service that deliver value to the customer\u2019.\nExamples of service features include uptime, response, and capability to quickly address problems.\nThe product class is comprised of architecture and requirements. This distinction supports the division of\nproduct development into conceptual and detailed phases. The conceptual phase identifies requirements, and\nthe detailed phase develops modules, components and a bill of materials. At the detailed level for machined\ncomponents, STEP AP224 classes can be used to define the machining features.\nThe process class is comprised of activities and resources. This is developed in line with the Process\nSpecification Language (PSL \u2013 see Gruninger & Menzel 2003) core, which defines processes in terms of\nactivities, objects and timepoints. Time is a requirement for process execution, however is has not been\nincluded as part of the proposed framework.\nThe resource class, in a similar manner to the PSL \u2018object\u2019 class, refers to any resource that is used by a\nprocess. Resource subclasses include facilities (e.g. manufacturing; service), equipment (e.g. tools; office\nequipment), person, material and information resource. The information resource class contains drawings,\nstandards, detailed machining features, tolerance data, materials data, and others.\nThere are a great deal of relationships between classes: many classes reference other classes. Those\nrelationships are not shown in the simplified system level knowledge structure diagram. The requirement for\nthe knowledge structure and the class relationships arises from the usage scenarios. Some examples of usage\nscenarios are given in the validation section.\nImplementation\nThe ontology was implemented using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 knowledge base editor tool. The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool allows the\ncreation of classes, properties and relationships; and the implementation of a knowledge base through the\ncreation of instances of those classes.\nKnowledge implemented in the system includes: requirements, design features, manufacturing features,\nmachining processes, machining best practices, inspection processes, manufacturing resources (tools,\nmachines), product descriptions, module descriptions, and component descriptions. Examples of the\nimplemented knowledge will be provided through the description of manufacturing and service knowledge\nusage scenarios.\nScenario development and validation\nThe structure and relationships of the knowledge base were developed and refined according to the content\nand usage scenarios captured during the case studies. Developing an ontology and defining classes and\ninstances is an iterative and content dependent activity (Noy and McGuinness 2002).\nThe usage scenarios support the development and validation of the knowledge base structure and content. The\naim of the integrated knowledge structure is design support. Our research activity developing the\nmanufacturing and service knowledge structures identified that the knowledge contributors require motivation\nto spend time populating the system. Both manufacturing and service managers aim to keep data recording to\na minimum. Therefore two important aspects contribute to this motivation: minimal time required for\ninputting data, and maximum potential for the system to support the activities of the knowledge provider. An\nintegrated approach to developing the knowledge flow is therefore favoured over a unidirectional service \/\nmanufacturing \uf0e0 design knowledge flow. Various scenarios were proposed in order to identify the\nknowledge flows required to support manufacturing, service, and design. These are described in the following\nsections.\n1.10. Service knowledge scenarios\nThe scenario used to develop and validate the service knowledge structure is taken from a service facing\nperspective. If the framework can support service operations, then the population and maintenance of the\ncontent will be taken on within service, and the feedback to design will maintain a higher level of relevance\nand accuracy.\nFour scenarios were considered during the development of the ontology: service feedback to design; ramping\nup the service activity after the product has been in the field for 12 months; on-site product monitoring within\nan availability contract; and implementing a new product into the service operation. The final scenario will be\ndescribed here.\nAn outline process model describing the service implementation scenario is shown in Figure 8. The first\nactivity relates to defining the product. Inputs from the knowledge framework include the product architecture\nclass (BOM, modules) and inputs from the resource class (e.g. drawing). The product description is likely, in\npractice, to represent a family of products with multiple variants. A further critical element is the intended\ncustomer application, defined using the \u2018installation environment\u2019 class. This includes references to resources\nincluding equipment and personnel.\nFigure 8: knowledge requirements of the service implementation scenario\nThe product size and application type dictate the requirements for floor space and chemical treatment\nfacilities. A template service (disassembly and rebuild) process forms part of the product release\ndocumentation. In Figure 8 this is supported by the two classes \u2018activities\u2019 and \u2018resources\u2019. This process will\nhave been evaluated by service personnel at the prototype stage. In combination with the projected volume,\nthis input is applied to the development of the service process. Activities and resources (personnel,\ninformation, tooling) required by the process are compared against the existing facility. Tooling, training, and\ntest procedures are developed according to the existing facility, in line with the volume of products expected.\nThe expected volume of products is a critical design feature for service process design. A low volume of\nproducts, say between 1 and 5 per week, may be carried out using generalist tooling in a flexible workshop,\ncarried out by personnel with a varied and wide ranging expertise. A medium volume of products, say\nbetween 10 and 50 per week, may warrant some specialist service bays and a division of the various activities\n(e.g. receive, disassemble, clean, inspect, rebuild, test). A higher volume of products may warrant further\ndivision of these activities and the application of flow line design principles. The description of this scenario\nidentifies that the knowledge requirements for the service implementation activity are supported by the\nknowledge structure. At a detailed level, our implementation does not currently describe customer\napplications (installation environment), BOM, or product modules in detail. Activities and resources for\nservice process development can be described in detail, as shown in Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is a free, open source ontology\neditor developed by the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research. It is used as a knowledge-base\nframework for knowledge solutions in various communities, including biomedicine, intelligence gathering,\nand corporate modelling (http:\/\/protege.stanford.edu).\nFigure 5.\n1.11. Manufacturing knowledge scenarios\nTwo scenarios were developed and validated: designer accessing manufacturing capability (tolerance) data,\nand manufacturing process planning support. Regarding machining process planning, manufacturing\nengineers identified that the capability of the system to provide feature-based best practice machining process\nknowledge would save them time in the NPI process and reduce the time taken to implement the process into\nmanufacturing. A cost saving of \u00a3100K was calculated per major design iteration, through reduced time\nrequired on the machine to optimise the machining process. An example best practice feature is shown in\nFigure 3. A more detailed description of the process planning support is given in Baxter et al. (2008).\nRegarding designers accessing machining capability data, the machining knowledge base was presented.\nDesigners reported that the system provides too much irrelevant information, that they had to \u2018drill down\u2019\nthrough too many levels to access to the data relevant to them, and that this would prevent them from\naccessing the system: \u201cif we have to dig for it, it won\u2019t be used\u201d. The designers described their requirements,\nwhich do not include details of the manufacturing process. As a result, the template shown in Figure 9 was\ndeveloped to provide designers with access to manufacturing capability data relating to component types in a\nfamiliar and visual format. The decision was taken to create a template according to two different\nmanufacturing capability levels, described according to scrap rate. One template would describe a component\nwith a Cpk of 1.66, which represents a very low (~0%) scrap rate. The second template has tighter tolerances\non all critical features, representing a 2% scrap rate. The tolerances corresponding to this scrap rate were\nassigned to the various features according to historical production data. This method of presenting tolerances\nto the designers performs two functions. First, they are presented in a manner which is easily accessed and\nused by the designers. Second, the scrap rate can be used as a simple cost multiplication factor: a known\ncomponent cost increases by a minimum of 102% with a 2% scrap rate. Good manufacturing practice would\n(somewhat arbitrarily) suggest a set of tolerances according to a Cpk of 2, or six sigma. In a high performance\nproduct whose manufacturing tolerances directly impact the performance, this must take account of the\noverall commercial picture: the value impact of the performance improvement vs. the cost impact of the\nmachining tolerance. A performance analysis activity showed that the impact of the two tolerance levels on\nthe pump clearances and expected performance (including throughput and ultimate pressure) was significant.\nFigure 9: design template with best practice tolerance data\nThe designer scenario shows that whilst the manufacturing knowledge framework does include the knowledge\nrequired to support this scenario, it does not support it well in its current form (i.e. via the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 interface).\nAs such, an implementation of this system should take into account the requirement to present the knowledge\nin a usable and familiar format according to the particular user.\n1.12. Conceptual design: service knowledge feedback scenario\nThe primary purpose of the proposed knowledge framework is to provide designers with access to service and\nmanufacturing knowledge. Within the case study company, feedback to designers from the product use phase\ncurrently exists in two key streams. The first, least frequent mechanism is the design change request. If a\nservice engineer identifies a problem they can create a request for a design change. The second mechanism is\nvia the ERP system, which records details of all transactions throughout the supply chain. NPI project\nmanagers request custom reports to provide feedback on issues such as service frequency and product life.\nThey may also identify component life, through parts replaced. They can also access service reports.\nStandardised reporting of the resource usage developed specifically for design feedback would be a valuable\ninput to NPI. Examples of useful existing data include labour hours and parts replaced, as major drivers of\nservice cost. If actual service costs are understood, then more accurate life cycle cost calculations can be made\nfor new PSS offerings: product management contracts which include service and spare parts provision. \u2018Hours\nrun\u2019 against parts replaced would also indicate the expected life of components or modules in a given\napplication. There is a wide variation in expected life since certain applications and cleaning chemicals\naggressively degrade the pumps. This is both a cost factor and an essential feedback mechanism describing\nreliability.\nRegarding reliability, designers suggested in the interviews that indication of failure cause is necessary for a\nfull appraisal of a product failure. \u2018Failure cause\u2019 is not a simple issue. There is some risk associated with\nservice technicians assigning root cause to product failures, since the cause is not always clear from the\nsymptoms. For every product service carried out, symptoms are recorded but root cause is not investigated.\nFor every warranty claim, an investigation is carried out to identify root cause in order to assign the cost of\nrepair. Where unusual or repeat failures occur, detailed investigations are carried out at the customer site by\napplications specialists to identify and rectify the root cause and improve system performance. Data from all\nthree types of investigation, including the reports produced and the photos taken of the pump during\ndisassembly, should be available to the design team in case they want to investigate any given product failure\nin more detail. Our study recognises that there is both cost (due to the time required for the investigation) and\nrisk (due to the possibility of assigning the wrong cause) associated with requesting \u2018root cause\u2019 from a\nservice report.\nRegarding feedback to design, in summary, we have proposed that design feedback take place through\nstandard reports to collate and display data collected by the ERP system. The detailed description of the report\ncontent, and a case example, is identified as further work.\nActivity level knowledge provision: context filters\nOne of the objectives of the research project was to develop context specific knowledge management filters.\nThis recognises that with an increasing amount of content available in a knowledge management system, there\nis a requirement to ensure that people are able to access knowledge relevant to their work function. The\napproach taken to ensure that appropriate knowledge can be delivered is to provide an activity level\nmechanism, which links knowledge resources with activities. The precise mechanism within the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9\nimplementation is the inclusion of a \u2018knowledge resource\u2019 slot in the activity class. This slot enables any\ninstance from any class in the knowledge base to be associated with an activity. Whilst the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 system\nlimits the content of the knowledge resources to alphanumeric inputs, the class structure supports the\nextension of the principle to include hypermedia links, attached files, and links to other systems. Examples of\nthese knowledge filters at the activity level are provided to illustrate design support with manufacturing and\nservice knowledge.\n1.13. Activity level knowledge provision: requirements specification\nThe requirements specification activity is one of the first activities to take place in the design project, as\nshown in the design reference model in Figure 2. The purpose of the activity is to identify and document the\nrequirements in order to develop an engineering specification for the product or system. Concurrent activities\ninclude product family definition (defining variants in the product range, i.e. 100, 200 and 600m3h-1 models),\nmodule definition (defining the strategy for common modules across the range), and service package design\n(the outline strategy for service delivery).\nIn the knowledge base, the requirements specification activity includes various knowledge resources,\nincluding requirements specifications from previous products. One such example is the requirements\nknowledge resource. This resource references a number of requirements instances from previous products\nsuch as \u2018service prime cost target\u2019, \u2018availability requirement\u2019, \u2018environmental conditions requirement\u2019,\n\u2018equipment interface requirement\u2019 and many others. These requirements reference the product they refer to\n(e.g. product-x-interface-requirement).\nThis requirements definition object shows all of the requirements categories applied within that project. Each\nrequirement instance then provides access to the detailed content applied to each category. For example, the\n\u2018availability\u2019 category indicates the requirement for the product start-up latency (<2s). The content of the\nmaintainability requirement includes: \u20185 year service interval\u2019, \u2018stable design\u2019, \u2018traceability\u2019, \u2018clear wiring\ninstructions\u2019, and others. The manufacturability requirement shows the facilities available at the enterprise,\nfactory, cell, and station level. This enables the design team to assess manufacturing location and equipment\nin terms of performance and cost requirements at this early concept stage. The detailed manufacturing\nanalysis activity is a separate task, and is described next.\nThe detailed reference to the requirements specification from previous projects supports the design team in\ndeveloping specifications for the new design project where they are not explicitly indicated by the market\nanalysis activity by giving them a clearly defined starting position. Various personnel are involved at this\nstage, including engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and customer application specialists. Each\ngroup should be able to offer their understanding of the changing importance of these previously applied\ncategories. The knowledge resource object provides a method to make them available at the right stage of the\nproduct development process such that they can have maximum impact.\nThe next stage in the development of this requirements knowledge resource is to associate requirements with\nin-service measurements and feedback to identify how well the requirements were met in practice. This\nextension represents further work.\n1.14. Activity level knowledge provision: manufacturability analysis\nFollowing the creation of the engineering requirements specification, the two subsequent design process\nactivities are manufacturability analysis and performance modelling. Support for the manufacturability\nanalysis task will be described here. The purpose of the task is to support the optimal definition of product\nparameters to meet the conflicting demands for pump performance and prime cost target. With a rotary\nvacuum pump, there is a relationship between the internal rotor-stator clearances and the throughput and\nvacuum pressure achievable at a given motor speed. A clearance is calculated according to the various\nmanufacturing tolerances which contribute, and their expected distribution. This indicates the range of\nassembly conditions and the likely failure rate. Input values to this calculation include the tolerances\ncontributing to the clearance. Alongside each tolerance, the likely scrap rates for a given manufacturing\nmethod will support the manufacturing cost calculation.\nKnowledge resources associated with the manufacturability analysis activity provide the tolerance and scrap\nrate data. Two types of manufacturing knowledge object are included: best practice components (to indicate\nthe best practice process, tools, machine, tolerances applied and measured scrap rates), and guaranteed\ntolerance values specified according to a generic manufacturing method, with expected scrap rates.\nFor similar components, the best practice component types are a good starting point, since they indicate the\nprocess type and tolerances achieved according to each critical feature (critical features contribute to the\nperformance analysis calculation). For new or novel feature types, the more general \u2018guaranteed values\u2019 are\nused (i.e. achievable straightness on a machined feature) according to the overall dimensions of the new\nfeature.\nHaving identified the particular features and manufacturing methods, the resources are applied to the tolerance\nanalysis calculations. Various combinations of manufacturing methods can be tested in this analysis stage to\nbalance the manufacturing cost with the required clearances. The calculated clearances are then provided as\nan input to the performance modelling activity. It should be noted that there is likely to be several iterations\nbetween these activities in order to satisfy the requirements of manufacturing cost and product performance.\nAdditional knowledge resources have also been added to the design reference model, including requirements\nspecifications, products, components, activities, features, and tools, to provide support to the other design\nprocess activities. The knowledge resources linked to the design activities represent either best practices, or\nexamples of good practice from previous projects.\nThese example applications of the knowledge resources indicate their capability to provide access to relevant\nknowledge according to the requirements of a particular work function or of a combined design activity.\nTechnically, the application of knowledge resources to activities is relatively simple, however deciding which\nspecific resources should be applied to which specific activities should be carried out by an experienced\nperson. A significant limitation of the approach is the high degree of manual input required. Where this\napproach has most value is in the definition of best practices: knowledge resources associated with a reusable\nprocess can be applied several times, offsetting the setup cost.\nValidation\nThe integrated knowledge base was validated with three companies according to qualitative criteria. Company\n1 and company 3 were involved at the early stages of this project, and helped to form the requirements of the\nsystem. Company 1 were used in the major case study. Company 2 took part in the project, but not the\nvalidation. Company 4, a company providing IT services to a range of manufacturing applications, took part\nin the validation activity.\nFour scenarios were described, and in each case a demonstration was given to indicate the operations required\nto access the system and the system content. In each case, the participants were asked to rate the utility of the\nsystem on a scale of 0-5, with 0 representing no value and 5 representing very high value. In the meetings\nwith company 1 and 3, 3 participants gave responses for each scenario and an average is presented. Company\n4 included a single participant, and the final scenario was not demonstrated due to time constraints. The four\nscenarios were: manufacturability analysis, manufacturing process planning support, requirements\nspecification with service input, and service operations feedback to design. The results indicated that for each\nscenario, the integrated knowledge base was judged to offer moderate to high value. The results are shown in\ntable 1.\nTable 1: validation responses\nManufacturing\nanalysis\nManufacturing\nplanning\nService\nrequirements\nService ops\nfeedback\nCompany 1 3.5 3.5 3.67 4.5\nCompany 3 3 2.5 3 4\nCompany 4 2.5 4 4.5 -\nDiscussion and further work\nA proposal has been made for a framework for knowledge reuse in a Product-Service Systems (PSS) design\nscenario. PSS design requires an integrated approach to the design of the product, service, and organisation.\nVarious design tools have been developed which support engineering design, including complex mechatronic\nsystems design.\nSchemebuilder (Bradley et al. 1992) was developed at the Lancaster University engineering design centre as a\nsoftware system to support the conceptual design of mechatronic products. The creation of a function\nstructure enabled multiple schemes to be created and compared. The function model also linked to a database\nof components, supporting automated retrieval and design reuse. The case study did not address functional\nmodelling as a product development approach. This represents a limitation of the proposed approach in terms\nof its applicability to novel product design in which functional modelling is the favoured practice. The use of\nrequirements in place of function is not a direct exchange. Function could also be extended to additional\nsystem modelling activities such as process design.\nEdalew & Abdalla (2001) developed a computer based intelligent system for automatic tool selection. Their\nmethod provided support for materials selection, in which a user can enter details about the required material\nproperties, which searches through a database to propose a suitable material. This section extends the\nCambridge Materials Selector (Ashby and Cebon 1996). Further, Edalew & Abdalla\u2019s system presents users\nwith machining techniques, tools, and machining parameters, extending to cutting time and an estimate of cost\nfor each feature. Several KBE methods were described in support of computer aided process planning,\nhowever these were rejected in this case due to the high implementation cost. Where the proposed method\ndiffers significantly from these alternative methods is primarily in the flexibility and the low implementation\ncost and effort. Access to material standards is required for novel designs, however for simple reuse scenarios\nthe selection process is already made and only a small number of parameters need be applied.\nThis research has demonstrated support for product design with downstream inputs from manufacturing and\nservice. Organisation design also requires further work.\nThe classes \u2018activity\u2019 and \u2018object\u2019 were adopted in this work from the PSL core to describe processes. Future\nwork is required to fully implement PSL for process description, to include the classes \u2018timepoint\u2019 and\n\u2018activity occurrence\u2019. This would improve the capability to describe and analyse processes in temporal terms.\nThis is particularly applicable to the assessment of cycle time for machining processes and the time required\nfor design or service processes.\nResearch is currently underway to investigate how the proposed knowledge framework can be applied within\na PLM environment. The application of a PLM system will overcome some of the limitations of the prototype\nsystem relating to concurrent user access, object tracking and version control, workflow support and\nintegration with other applications.\nA dynamic approach to providing relevant knowledge applicable to a large scale enterprise system would\nrequire additional personnel profiling categories in order to dynamically assign knowledge objects to\nactivities. This automation support for the knowledge filters approach would reduce the maintenance effort\nrequired. The effectiveness of a formal ontology based approach could be evaluated and compared with a\nWeb 2.0 method (folksonomy \/ tagging) in terms of effort required and relevance of the results.\nConclusion\nWhilst there are several apparent benefits for manufacturing companies to progress to servitization or PSS\nbusiness models, there is not a clear migration approach. The changing nature of the design challenge is one\nsuch area which requires considerable further research, to investigate the needs of NPI teams when faced with\nthe challenge of developing new product-service systems.\nIn mature engineering industries, there is a strong case for knowledge reuse. The proliferation of knowledge\nbased systems and design process modelling is a good indicator of this. The application of knowledge in\ndiscrete engineering scenarios is good, however knowledge management methods for PSS design and system\nlevel design support are lacking. Our research indicates that feedback from service operations to design is\nlimited. We have also identified that a common approach to knowledge management would be beneficial for a\nbroader application of best practices in NPI, including design processes and manufacturing methods.\nAn integrated knowledge framework to support PSS design has been described using examples from an\nindustry study. The structure of the knowledge framework is based on the central class \u2018life cycle system\u2019.\nThe classes product, process and resource are used to describe the system in more detail. We have\ndemonstrated that design knowledge can be represented using the design process. Activities which are part of\nthat process are associated with knowledge resources. Manufacturing knowledge is represented using a STEP-\nbased feature model to describe machining features. Manufacturing and service processes, activities and\nresources are represented in the framework and made available to designers and service managers. In\nparticular, support is available for the requirements definition, service-package-design and service-process-\ndesign phases.\nAcknowledgementsref_startAcknowledgementsa\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Cranfield IMRC, which in turn is supported by the\nEPSRC.
