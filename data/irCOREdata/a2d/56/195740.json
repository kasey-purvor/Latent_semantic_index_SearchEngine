The mature miRNAs negatively\nregulate gene expression by targeting specific messenger RNAs\n(mRNAs) for cleavage or translational repression.9 A growing\nbody of evidence suggests that they are involved in the control\nof a wide range of physiological pathways, such as development,\ndifferentiation, growth, and metabolism, as well as in disease\nconditions.10,11 Recent evidence has implicated overall miRNA\nlevels in regulating angiogenesis and endothelial function.12\u201316\nHere, we found that a particular miRNA, miR-217, is progres-\nsively expressed in endothelial cells during aging. In silico\nanalysis indicates that SirT1 is a potential target of miR-217.\nThus, in the present studies, we sought to address whether\nendothelial senescence is determined by a miR-217\u2013dependent\nSirT1 loss of function.\nMethods\nCells and Cell Culture\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), human aortic\nendothelial cells (HAECs), and human coronary artery endothelial\nReceived March 13, 2009; accepted August 7, 2009.\nFrom the Department of Internal Medicine (R.M., V.C., M.C., R.L., M.F.), Department of Surgery (E.M., A.I.), IDI-IRCCS Biochemistry Laboratory,\nc\/o Department of Experimental Medicine (A.T., G.M.), and Department of Biopathology and Imaging (F.A., G.N.), University of Rome Tor Vergata,\nRome, Italy; and Medical Research Council (M.V.-N., G.M.), Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.\nThe online-only Data Supplement is available with this article at http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864629\/DC1.\nCorrespondence to Massimo Federici, MD, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy.\nE-mail federicm@uniroma2.it\n\u00a9 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.\nCirculation is available at http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org DOI: 10.1161\/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.864629\n1524\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on April 30, 2010 circ.ahajournals.orgDownloaded from \ncells (HCAECs) were purchased from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland)\nand cultured as described previously.17 Population-doubling levels\n(PDLs) were calculated as described previously18; briefly, the\nnumber of population doublings (PD) that occurred between pas-\nsages was calculated according to the equation PD\u0003log2(Ch\/Cs),\nwhere Ch is the number of viable cells at harvest and Cs is the\nnumber of cells seeded. All experiments were performed at the PDLs\nindicated in the text.\nIsolation of miRNA and Microarray Analysis\nEnriched miRNA was isolated from HUVECs with the mirVana\nmiRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion Inc, Austin, Tex), which allows\nisolation of both enriched miRNA and larger RNA species sepa-\nrately. A MirVana miRNA Bioarray (Ambion) was used to compare\nmiRNA expression in PDL8 and PDL44 cells. Four micrograms of\nenriched small RNA fractions was labeled fluorescently and hybrid-\nized to the bioarrays according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nThe slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B Microarray Scanner\n(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) at the optimal wavelength for\nthe Alexa555 (F532) and Alexa647 (F635) dyes (Molecular Probes\/\nInvitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) with lasers. The acquired images were\nanalyzed with GenePix Pro 5.0 (Molecular Devices). miRNA spots\nwere automatically segmented, local backgrounds (B635 and B532)\nwere subtracted, and both total intensities (F635 and F532) and the\nfluorescence ratios of the 2 dyes were calculated for each spot. The\nspots were flagged when they exhibited poor hybridization signals,\nwhen they were saturated (F635 or F532, median\u000365 535), or when\nthe signal-to-background ratio was \u00042. Microarray data have been\ndeposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information\nGene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/\ngeo\/) and are accessible through GEO series accession No.\nGSE14912. Bioinformatic prediction of target genes and miRNA\nbinding sites was performed with different miRNA databases,\nnamely, miRBase (http:\/\/microrna.sanger.ac.uk\/), PicTar (http:\/\/\npictar.mdc-berlin.de\/), and TargetScan (http:\/\/www.targetscan.org\/\nindex.html).\nNorthern Blot Analysis\nA total of 1.5 \u0001g of enriched small RNA fractions or 15 \u0001g of total\nRNA was resolved on a 15% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen) in 1X TBE\nbuffer. Gels were stained briefly with ethidium bromide, and RNAs\nwere transferred by electroblotting onto GeneScreen Plus mem-\nbranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, Mass) for 2 hours at\n20 V in 0.5X TBE. The membranes were UV cross-linked (Stratal-\ninker; Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif). Prehybridization was performed\nfor 1 hour at 42\u00b0C in ULTRAhyb-Oligo hybridization buffer\n(Ambion), and the membranes were hybridized overnight at 42\u00b0C in\nthe same buffer with the labeled probe. Antisense RNA probes were\n3\u0001\u2013end-labeled with 32P-\u0002ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase; miR-\n217 antisense probe sequence TCCAATCAGTTCCTGATGCAGTA\nand U2 spliceosomal RNA antisense probe sequence GGGTGCAC-\nCGTTCCTGGAGGTAC were used. The membranes were washed\ntwice for 30 minutes in 0.5% SDS, 2X SSC and exposed on an\nImaging Screen-K (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif) at room temperature.\nImage scanning and analysis were performed on a personal molec-\nular imager with QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad).\nmiRNA and mRNA Real-Time Quantitative\nReverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain\nReaction Analysis\nReal-time quantification to measure miRNAs was performed with\nthe TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription kit and miRNA assay\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with the ABI PRISM 7000\nsystem (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). The U43 small\nnucleolar RNA (RNU43) was used as the housekeeping small RNA\nreference gene. For mRNA analysis, single-strand complementary\nDNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 \u0001g of total RNA sample\nisolated through TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) with a high-capacity\ncDNA archive kit according to the standard protocol. Fifty nano-\ngrams of cDNA was amplified by real-time polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR) and normalized to 18S ribosomal RNA as an\nendogenous control. Each reaction was performed in triplicate,\nand analysis was performed by the 2\u0005\u0006\u0006Ct method as described\npreviously.19 Primer identification numbers (Applied Biosystems)\nwere as follows: let7a, 4373169; hsa-miR-21, 4373090; hsa-miR-31,\n4373190; hsa-miR-34, 4373278; hsa-miR-92, 4373013; hsa-miR-\n181b, 4373116; hsa-miR-216, 4373083; hsa-miR-217, 4373082;\nhsa-miR-503, 4373228; and RNU43, 4373375.\nmiRNA Transfection\nNucleofection of HUVECs and HAECs was performed according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the Nucleofector machine\n(Amaxa\/Lonza). Cells (1\u0007106) were resuspended in 100 \u0001L of\nHUVEC nucleofection solution (Amaxa\/Lonza), and 0 to 40 nmol\/L\nof miRIDIAN miR-217 mimic (miR217), 20 nmol\/L of miRIDIAN\nmiR-216 mimic (miR216), 20 nmol\/L of miRIDIAN mir-217 inhib-\nitor (A217), or 0 to 40 nmol\/L of control scramble sequences\n(respectively, Co and CA; Dharmacon, Lafayette, Colo) was added.\nSamples were transferred into certified cuvettes (Amaxa\/Lonza) and\ntransfected with program A-034. Nucleofection of HCAECs was\nperformed in HCAEC nucleofector solution (Amaxa\/Lonza) with\nprogram S-005. Fresh medium (500 \u0001L) was added immediately\nafter transfection to each cuvette, and the cells were plated and\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days.\nLuciferase Assay\nThe SirT1 3\u0001-UTR sequence spanning 1940 base pairs (bp) was PCR\namplified with primers (\u0002) TGA TGG AGA TGA TCA AGA GGC\nand (\u0005) GAC CCA TGG AGA TGA TCA AGA GGC. This region\ncontains the miR-217 consensus response element, located between\n3740 and 3769 bp downstream of the ATG of sequence AF083106.\nThe amplicon was inserted into the XbaI site of the pGL3 control\nvector (Promega, Madison, Wis) downstream of the cDNA for the\nluciferase reporter gene. Empty pGL3-basic and pGL3-SirT1-3\u0001UTR\nwere used to test miR-217 activity. Each vector, along with varying\ndoses (20 and 40 nmol\/L) of miR217, was transfected into human\nembryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with Lipofectamine 2000\nreagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nCells were cultured for 2 days and assayed with the Dual-Luciferase\nReporter Assay System (Promega).\nIn Vitro Angiogenesis Assay\nFor tube formation assays, HUVECs were transfected, and after 18\nhours, cells (1\u0007105) were seeded on a 12-well plate coated with 200\n\u0001L of ECMatrix Solution according to the standard protocol (Chemi-\ncon International, Temecula, Calif). Tube length was quantified after\n24 hours by measuring the cumulative tube length in 5 random\nmicroscopic fields with a computer-assisted microscope using the\nLucia program, as described previously.20\nTelomerase Assay\nHUVECs were washed in PBS and lysed, and telomerase activity\nwas measured by the TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISAPLUS kit\n(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Inc).\nSenescence-Associated \u0001-Galactosidase Staining\nAt 10 days after transfection, HUVECs and HAECs were fixed, and\nthe senescent status was verified by in situ staining for senescence-\nassociated \u0003-galactosidase (SA-\u0003-gal) as described previously.21\nBriefly, cells were grown on 6-well culture plates, washed with PBS,\nand fixed with 2% formaldehyde\/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5\nminutes. After another washing step with PBS, cells were incubated\nwith \u0003-galactosidase staining solution (150 mmol\/L NaCl, 2 mmol\/L\nMgCl2, 5 mmol\/L potassium ferricyanide, 5 mmol\/L potassium\nferrocyanide, 40 mmol\/L citric acid, 12 mmol\/L sodium phosphate,\npH 6.0, containing 1 mg\/mL 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u0003-D-\ngalactoside [X-gal]) for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was stopped\nby the addition of PBS. Statistical analysis was performed by\ncounting at least 600 cells for each condition. As a positive control,\nPDL8 cells transfected with control oligonucleotide were treated\nMenghini et al miR-217 Causes Endothelial Senescence 1525\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on April 30, 2010 circ.ahajournals.orgDownloaded from \nwith 100 \u0001mol\/L H2O2 at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to generate oxidative\nstress, which leads to cellular senescence.\nWestern Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation\nWestern blots were performed as described previously22\u201325 with the\nfollowing antibodies: Anti-eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories,\nSan Jose, Calif), anti-SirT1 (Abcam Inc, Cambridge, Mass), anti-\nFoxO1 and anti-acetyl-FoxO1 K242 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nSanta Cruz, Calif), anti-acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling), anti-acety-\nlated p53 (lys382) and p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,\nMass), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-tubulin\n(Sigma, St Louis, Mo). Immunoprecipitation experiments were\nperformed as described previously22\u201325 with 1 to 2 mg of total cell\nextracts for each sample. Where indicated, cells were treated with\nnicotinamide 5 mmol\/L for 3 hours before lysis.\nAtherosclerotic Plaque Sampling\nFrozen human atherosclerotic plaque samples (n\u000363) from patients\nwho underwent carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic disease\nwere homogenized with a polytron homogenizer in TRIzol reagents\n(Invitrogen) for total RNA isolation and in ice-cold lysis buffer\n(20 mmol\/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmol\/L EGTA, 150 mmol\/L NaCl,\n20 mmol\/L glycerophosphate, 10 mmol\/L NaF, 1 mmol\/L sodium\northovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 \u0001g\/mL aproti-\nnin, 1 mmol\/L PMSF) for cell protein lysates. Real-time PCR and\nWestern blot analysis were performed as described above.\nStatistical Analysis\nGroup differences of continuous variables were compared by 1-way\nANOVA or Student t test as appropriate. Relationships between\nvariables were determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient.\nContinuous data are expressed as mean\bSD. A P value \u00040.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant. All analyses were performed with\nGraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, Calif) and SPSS\nsoftware program version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) for\nWindows.\nResults\nmiR-217 Expression Is Upregulated in Aging\nEndothelial Cells\nTo investigate the role of miRNAs in endothelial cell\nsenescence, we first profiled the miRNA signature during\nHUVEC aging18 using a DNA microarray for mature forms\nof miRNAs of human, mouse, and rat origin. Analysis of\nsamples from PDL8 HUVECs revealed that the present\nresults were in keeping with previous reports from other\ngroups.12,13 In particular, the most highly expressed miRNAs\nin our baseline (miR-126, miR-16, miR-21, miR-221, and\nmiR-222) overlapped with those from published databas-\nes.12,13 Next, we compared the miRNA profile obtained in old\nHUVECs (PDL44) versus young cells (PDL8; online-only\nData Supplement Figure I). We found several miRNAs were\nsignificantly upregulated with aging (Figure 1A); among\nthese, miR-217 (located on chromosome 2p16.1) was the\nmost significantly differentially expressed miRNA. To vali-\ndate the present findings, we analyzed the most significantly\nchanged miRNAs by RT-PCR, which confirmed the results\nobtained by microarray, with the exception of miR-92 and\nmiR-503 (Figure 1B).\nSirT1 Is a Potential Target of miR-217\nComputational miRNA target analysis from miRNA data-\nbases identified homology between miR-217 and a region that\nextended between 3740 and 3769 bp from the ATG (GB\nAF083106) in the 3\u0001-UTR of the human SirT1 RNA, which\nestablishes this gene as a potential molecular target for\nmiR-217 (Figure 2A). miR-216, which is also induced with\naging (Figure 1), was not linked to SirT1 by computational\nanalysis; by contrast, miR-34 was demonstrated to affect\nSirT1.26 However, their variation in both microarray analysis\nand RT-PCR was less significant than that of miR-217\n(online-only Data Supplement Figure I; Figure 1A and 1B).\nNorthern blot assays and quantitative RT-PCR analysis\nwith primers that recognize mature miR-217 confirmed the\nupregulation of miR-217 expression during endothelial senes-\ncence in both total RNA and enriched small RNA fractions\n(Figure 2B through 2E). The induction of miR-217 with\naging, as shown by RT-PCR in HUVECs at different pas-\nsages, suggested that it might play a primary role in the aging\nresponse. Moreover, in the same cells, SirT1 expression was\ncorrespondingly downregulated, as assessed by RT-PCR and\nWestern blot analysis (Figure 2F and 2G).\nFurthermore, we used a SirT1 3\u0001-UTR luciferase reporter\nvector to explore the effect of miR-217 on expression of SirT1\nmRNA. Cotransfection of pre-miR-217 (miR217), which\nmimics mature miR-217, with SirT1 3\u0001-UTR reporter in\nHEK293 cells resulted in 40% inhibition of luciferase activity\ncompared with samples transfected with the control oligonu-\ncleotide (Figure 2H).\nmiR-217 Downregulates Endogenous SirT1\nExpression in HUVECs and HAECs\nTo further confirm the hypothesis that miR-217 negatively\nregulates SirT1 expression, we preliminarily transfected\nPDL8 HUVECs with different concentrations of miR217 or\nmiR-let7a\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nm\niR\nN\nA \nex\npr\nes\nsi\non\n (T\naq\nm\nan\n re\nal\n ti\nm\ne \na.\nu.\n)\nmiR-21\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nmiR-216 miR-217\n0\n5\n10\n15\nmiR-31b\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nmiR-34\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nmiR-92miR-181 b\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nPDLs8\nPDLs44\nhs\na-l\net-\n7a\nhs\na-m\niR\n-17\n-5p\nhs\na-m\niR\n-18\n1a\nhs\na-m\niR\n-18\n1b\nhs\na-m\niR\n-21\nhs\na-m\niR\n-21\n6\nhs\na-m\niR\n-21\n7\nhs\na-m\niR\n-27\na\nhs\na-m\niR\n-27\nb\nhs\na-m\niR\n-29\na\nhs\na-m\niR\n-31\nhs\na-m\niR\n-34\na\nhs\na-m\niR\n-92\nhs\na-m\niR\n-50\n3\n** **\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n***\n***\n***\n*\n*\n* *\n**\n**\n**\n**\nHUVEC\nA\nB\n0\n5\n10\n15\n***\n**\n**\n***\n***\n***\n0\n2\n4\n6\nmiR-503\nFo\nld\n c\nha\nng\ne \n(a\n.u\n.)\nFigure 1.

After 3 days, both RT-PCR (n\u00033)\nand immunoblotting (n\u00032) revealed that SirT1 levels were\nsignificantly diminished in PDL8 HUVECs transfected with\nmiR217 compared with controls, with slightly increasing effi-\ncacy ranging from 5 to 40 nmol\/L (online-only Data Supplement\nFigure IIA and IIB). On the basis of these results, we chose a\nfinal concentration of 20 nmol\/L (Figure 3A and 3B). Next, we\nanalyzed PDL44 HUVECs, in which we observed that the\nreduction of miR-217 levels by transfection with the same\namount of antisense oligonucleotide (A217) led to an increase in\nSirT1 expression after 3 days. Moreover, in PDL44 HUVECs,\ncotransfection with A217 and miR217 reversed the increase of\nSirT1 expression, reducing the RNA and protein levels above\ncontrol values (Figure 3C and 3D). After transfection, the\nmiR-217 levels were determined by RT-PCR or Northern blot\n(online-only Data Supplement Figures IIC through IIF). To\nestablish the relevance of the present findings to other endothe-\nlium models, we analyzed the effect of miR-217 in PDL8\nHAECs.

Cotransfection\nwith miR217 significantly abrogated the effect of A217 on\nSA-\u0003-gal activity (Figure 4A and 4B). Endothelial senescence is\naccompanied by telomerase inactivation.27 We found that in\nboth PDL8 and PDL44 HUVECs, telomerase activity was\ndependent on modulation of miR-217 levels (Figure 4C), which\nconfirms a crucial role for miR-217 in HUVEC senescence.\nMoreover, analysis of SA-\u0003-gal activity in HAECs at PDL8\nrevealed a similar significant effect of miR217 (Figure 4D).\nTo further verify that this was a miR-217\u2013specific activity, we\nanalyzed the effect of miR216 on SA-\u0003-gal activity, because\nmiR-216 was similarly overexpressed in our preliminary mi-\ncroarray experiment. We found that miR216 was not able to\nreduce SirT1 expression (online-only Data Supplement Figure\nIIIA) or to induce senescence when injected alone, and it did not\nincrease the miR217 effect on SA-\u0003-gal activity, which suggests\nthat miR-216 may possibly be involved in other aspects of the\naging process (online-only Data Supplement Figure IIIB). To\nanalyze the effects of miR-217 on vascular-like network forma-\ntion, we performed an in vitro Matrigel assay. Transfection with\nmiR217 in PDL8 HUVECs led to a significant impairment of\ntube-forming activity (Figure 5A); conversely, in PDL44\nHUVECs, reduction of miR-217 with A217 resulted in rescued\ntube formation in the Matrigel assay (Figure 5B).\nmiR-217 Modulates SirT1 Deacetylase Activity in\nEndothelial Cells\nTo test whether the processes controlled by miR-217 could be\nmediated by a deacetylation-dependent regulation of SirT1\nFigure 4. miR-217 modulates senescence in HUVECs and HAECs.

In PDL8\nHUVECs, overexpression of miR217 resulted in marked\nFoxO1 acetylation, similar to control cells treated with\nnicotinamide, an inhibitor of SirT1 deacetylase activity (Fig-\nure 6A). Interestingly, although we found that HUVEC\nsenescence was associated with increased FoxO1 acetylation,\nwe observed that it was not associated with increased p53\nacetylation, and miR217 did not affect p53 acetylation, which\nsuggests that it may act specifically to modulate angiogenic\nrather than apoptotic SirT1 targets (online-only Data Supple-\nment Figure IVA and IVB). By contrast, in PDL44 HUVECs,\nA217 reduced FoxO1 acetylation levels (Figure 6B).\nTo confirm that FoxO1 is an indirect target of miR-217, we\ncompared mRNA expression of genes coordinately regulated\nby SirT1 and FoxO1 in both young and old HUVECs\ntransfected with miR217 or A217. The results showed that\nmiR-217 is involved in the mRNA modulation of FoxO1\ntargets, such as the stress-resistance gene GADD45 (growth\narrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene); Fms-related ty-\nrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1), a crucial regulatory tyrosine kinase\nreceptor for angiogenesis; and endothelial nitric oxide synthase\n(eNOS), which is essential for endothelial function (Figure 6C\nand 6D). Similar results on FoxO1 acetylation (Figure 6E) and\nFoxO1 gene targets (Figure 6F) were observed in HAECs.\nGene-expression studies revealed that miR217 was also able to\ndownregulate SirT1 and FoxO1 targets in HCAECs (online-only\nData Supplement Figure VA).\nPreviously, it has been shown that SirT1 directly modulates\neNOS expression and acetylation.28 We observed that miR-\n217 significantly affects eNOS levels in both PDL8 and\nPDL44 HUVECs (Figure 7A and 7B) and in HAECs (Figure\n7C). Next, we investigated whether modulation of miR-217\naffects eNOS acetylation in PDL8 cells. To avoid artifacts\ndue to the different eNOS levels caused by miR217 overex-\npression and consequent effects on FoxO1 downregulation of\neNOS,29 we performed immunoprecipitation assays using 2\nmg of lysate, an amount of protein that exceeded the\nprecipitating antibody capacity; in fact, immunoprecipitation\nof eNOS with 1 mg of protein did not allow for clear detection\nof the acetylation state (data not shown). The present results\nrevealed that miR217 enhances eNOS acetylation when overex-\npressed in young cells. Conversely, A217 decreased eNOS\nacetylation in PDL44 HUVECs, an effect reversed by the\npresence of miR217 (Figure 7D and 7E), thus confirming that\nmiR-217 is a regulator of the SirT1-eNOS axis.\nMiR-217 Is Negatively Correlated With SirT1\nExpression in Human Atherosclerotic Plaques\nFunctional changes in senescent vascular cells in vivo may\nplay an important role in the pathophysiology of age-\nassociated vascular disorders.2 Therefore, to investigate the\nfunction of miR-217 in vivo, we examined miR-217, SirT1,\nand SirT1 target expression in plaques from patients who\nunderwent carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic disease\n(online-only Data Supplement Table I).

This result was\nfurther confirmed by the evidence that SirT1 correlated in a\npositive manner with its vascular targets GADD45, Flt1, and\neNOS (Figure 8B through 8D). Next, we analyzed the\natherosclerotic plaques that had the highest versus lowest\nmiR-217 levels (n\u00037 for each group; Figure 8E). These\nsamples showed reciprocal levels for SirT1 mRNA and\nprotein (Figure 8F through 8H). Moreover, Western blot\nassays confirmed that a reciprocal association exists in vivo\nbetween the expression levels of miR-217 and the acetylation\nstate of FoxO1 (Figure 8G and 8I).\nDiscussion\nAging is one of the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes\nmellitus and atherosclerosis, the leading causes of morbidity\nand mortality in Western countries. Among the age-\nassociated functional and structural changes, of particular\nnote is the decline in endothelial function, the molecular basis\nof which is not fully defined.2 Endothelial growth and\nsenescence are characterized by a progressive decrease in\nSirT1-dependent control of the FoxO1 transcription factor.8\nSirT1 belongs to the class III histone deacetylases that have\nbeen implicated in the regulation of cellular senescence and\nlongevity in several organisms and as master regulators of\nmetabolic efficiency under different nutrient availability.\nLoss of function of SirT1 and other sirtuins is unexplained.\nHere, we have shown that endothelial senescence is depen-\ndent on the age-progressive increase in miRNA miR-217,\nwhich affects SirT1 expression, leading to loss of SirT1\nfunction on its major endothelial targets, FoxO1 and\neNOS.28\u201331\nFigure 7.

This is paralleled by a decrease in SirT1 expres-\nsion. Second, modulation of miR-217 is able to induce\ncellular senescence in young cells, whereas inhibition of\nmiR-217 rescues, in part, aging phenotypes in old cells. This\nis reflected by the impact of miR-217 on tube formation in a\nMatrigel assay, which is rescued once miR-217 levels are\nreduced by its synthetic antagonist. Third, miR-217 affects\nthe acetylation state of 2 major targets of SirT1 in endothelial\nfunction, FoxO1 and eNOS, which are both determinant\nfactors for angiogenesis and tube formation.\nIn particular, FoxO1 acts as a negative regulator of angio-\ngenesis and vascular growth, and it is hypothesized to also act\nas a sensor of cellular metabolism and health at chromatin\nlevels, promoting either cellular apoptosis or resistance to\noxidative stress.8,30,31 FoxO1 (and FoxO3a) also negatively\nregulates eNOS expression.29 MiR-217 may therefore begin a\nvicious circle that acts against eNOS regulation, reducing\nSirT1 and increasing FoxO1 repression activities. This is\nsupported by evidence of miR-217\u2013dependent changes in the\nexpression of FoxO1 endothelial targets, including eNOS,\nFlt1, and GADD45.\nSirT1 is believed to associate with FoxO transcription\nfactors in an acetylation-dependent manner, switching FoxO\nactivities from promotion of apoptosis toward resistance to\noxidative stress. An interaction between SirT1 and FoxO was\npreviously documented during angiogenesis signaling.8 Here,\nwe show for the first time that miR-217 acts as a natural\nendogenous inhibitor for the SirT1\/FoxO1 pathway during\nendothelial growth, thereby promoting cellular senescence.\nTo provide a human pathological perspective, we analyzed\natherosclerotic plaque samples to examine miR-217 expres-\nsion and effects. The histology of human atherosclerotic\nlesions has been studied extensively, and it has been demon-\nstrated that these lesions contain endothelial cells that exhibit\nthe morphological features of senescence.2,31,32 The present\ndata suggest that miR-217 regulation of SirT1 is present in\nvivo and is related to the SirT1\/FoxO1 pathway, which\nimplicates miR-217 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\nIn conclusion, we have identified an endogenous inhibitor\nof SirT1, miR-217, that interferes with SirT1\/FoxO1 func-\ntions in angiogenesis and senescence. This opens new ave-\nnues in the search for mechanisms related to both the\nfunctions of sirtuins and their application in the treatment of\nendothelial dysfunction and related metabolic disorders.\nSources of Funding\nThis study was supported by grants from Fondazione Roma research\ngrant 2008 (to Dr Federici and Dr Novelli); grants from Telethon\n(GGP-08065), JDRF RRG 1-2007-665, Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Diabeto-\nlogia (research grant 2007), Italian Ministry of University grants\n(PRIN 2006\/2008), all to Dr Federici; grants from the Ministry of\nHealth (to Dr Federici and Dr Melino); and EU grant EPISTEM (to\nDr Melino).\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.

On the basis of recent evidence, we\nhypothesized that microRNAs, a class of endogenous, small, noncoding, single-stranded RNAs of approximately 22\nnucleotides that are known to negatively regulate gene expression, may be a cause of endothelial dysfunction. In the present\nstudy, we used a model of endothelial senescence to identify microRNAs associated with the aging process and to\nrecognize their potential targets. We found that a particular microRNA, miR-217, is progressively expressed in endothelial\ncells during senescence. In silico analysis indicated that silent information regulator 1 (SirT1) is a potential target of\nmiR-217. SirT1 is an NAD\u0002-dependent deacetylase that regulates gene expression and exerts protective effects against\nendothelial dysfunction and metabolic syndrome. SirT1 action is lost during aging, but the cause of the age-related decline\nof SirT1 is unknown. Thus, in the present studies, we sought to address whether endothelial senescence is determined by\na miR-217\u2013dependent SirT1 loss of function. We observed that miR-217 inhibits SirT1 function in endothelial cells,\nspecifically by reducing its ability to modulate the function of a transcription factor called FoxO1 that is involved in\nangiogenesis, apoptosis, and stress resistance. The inhibition of miR-217 rescues the phenotype of senescent endothelial\ncells. The evidence for such a miR-217\u2013SirT1-FoxO1 pathway in atherosclerotic plaque from human donors has clear\nclinical implications for the possibility of interfering with miR-217 by use of treatments to antagonize its function in the\nendothelium of patients.\n1532 Circulation October 13, 2009\n at University of Leicester (lei) \/ England on April 30, 2010 circ.ahajournals.orgDownloaded from \nSupplementary Figure 1.
