It seeks to move away from the \nconcept of \u2018digital divide\u2019 which has dominated debate in this area while presuming a \nrather static notion of the space which the Internet is, or could become. Instead, it \ndraws on deliberative democracy theory in general and John Dryzek\u2019s concept of \n\u2018discursive design\u2019 in particular to formulate six types of issue (Convergence, Who \nConverges?, Deliberation, Public Action, Relations to the State, and Long-term \nPatterns of Practice) around which both empirical research and ethical debate can \nfocus, and which taken together will help answer whether the Internet is, or can be, in \npart a \u2018discursive design\u2019 which contributes to the conditions of democratic public \nlife. \n \nKeywords: \n \nDeliberative democracy; digital divide; discursive design; Internet architecture; public \nspace; public sphere.  \n \n \nDIGITAL DIVIDE OR DISCURSIVE DESIGN? \nON THE EMERGING ETHICS OF INFORMATION SPACE \n \nWhat type of space will the Internet become? In his recent book, The Internet Galaxy, \nManuel Castells has argued for a fundamentally positive view of the potential of the \nInternet (since it makes possible \u2018for the first time the communication of many to \nmany in chosen time, on a global scale\u2019), 1* but also for an empirically-based caution \nabout whether this potential will be realised and for whom. Many would agree, but the \nquestion remains: what are the modalities for researching emerging inequalities in the \nstructure of Internet use and access? Or, put another way, what might a debate about \nthe ethics of The Internet as information space look like? \n \nAs its title suggests, this article attempts to move away from discussion couched \nexclusively in terms of the \u2018digital divide\u2019 and towards another, more open, \nformulation: discursive design. \u2018Discursive design\u2019 is a term from political theory, \nspecifically John Dryzek\u2019s version of deliberative democracy theory,2* and we will \ncome to its definition later, but first it is important to explain the changes of emphasis \nwhich this latter term implies for understanding the organisation of the Internet as \ninformation space, or rather a collection of overlapping information spaces.  \n \nA good standard definition of the term we need to move away from - \u2018digital divide\u2019 \u2013 \nhas recently been offered by Ronald Rice: \u2018the differential access to and use of the \n                                                          \n1\n Manuel Castells. The Internet Galaxy. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2001, page 2. \n2\n John Dryzek Discursive Democracy. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1990. \n 3\nInternet according to gender, income, race and location\u2019.3* As a current definition, \nthis is useful since it incorporates an important shift in digital divide debates, from \nmere \u2018access\u2019 to \u2018access and use\u2019 (more on this below). Even so, this definition gives \nlittle sense of how the structure of information space, to which individuals are \nunderstood to have access or to put to use, may itself be articulated with changing \npatterns of access and use. \u2018The Internet\u2019 in this definition is inert, preformed, simply \n\u2018there\u2019. This closes down questions about the changing nature of the Internet as \ninformation space or, more broadly, \u2018communication space\u2019, and goes hand in hand \nwith limited curiosity about the agents who have such access or make such use. \nCertainly they are more than the units switched \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 assumed by early digital \ndivide debates, but all the same Rice\u2019s definition does not mention the definitional \nissues embedded within changing forms of use. As Roger Silverstone argued long \nago, information and communication technologies are doubly articulated, both as \nmedia that have significance in themselves and as media for carrying specific sets of \nmeanings.4* People articulate the meanings of information and communication \ntechnologies, partly in accordance with habits and fixed formulas, of course, but \npartly also through explicit reflection as thinking individuals. It is this deliberative \naspect of Internet use, and the recognition that people may also be divided along this \ndimension, which are absent from Rice\u2019s definition.  \n \nThis takes us to an important point that is different when we apply the notion of \n\u2018discursive design\u2019 to the Internet; it encourages us to see that the Internet is not mere \ninfrastructure (whose organisation, once in place, can be safely black-boxed, insulated \nfrom further deliberation). On the contrary, Internet infrastructure is, and should \nremain, open to deliberative intervention and ethical inquiry. That is one implication \nof the term \u2018discursive design\u2019. To emphasise this is, however, to go against \nunderstandings of the Internet as a privatised space of individual market consumption, \nwhich by definition is both outside of all but the most obvious public policy concerns \n(decency, criminality, and so on) and need contain no spaces for public deliberation \nabout anything, including its own architecture. We reach here what Oscar Gandy has \nrecently called \u2018the real digital divide\u2019: the widening division between consumer and \ncitizen discourses.5* To discuss the ethics of the Internet as information space is, \nprecisely, to insist that questions of citizenship are at stake in the Internet\u2019s \narchitecture, questions for civic deliberation which go beyond the purely formal rules \nnecessary for market functioning. \n \nThis is not, of course, to suggest that the Internet is only, or even primarily, a space \nfor public deliberation or citizenship practice: that would be absurd, both in principle \n                                                          \n3\n Ronald Rice,  Primary Issues in Internet Use.

The Internet is many different spaces (of entertainment, general information, \nprivate communication, and, potentially at least, public deliberation) that overlap with \neach other and also connect with a wide range of non-virtual spaces (from the football \nground to dance venue, from shopping mall to trading floor and political meeting). \nThis heterogeneity should not deter general theorisation. The issue is not whether the \nInternet as a whole can be appropriated as political and civic space (clearly it cannot), \nbut whether it is a communication space where the political and the civic will, in the \nlong-term, have any purchase.  \n \nSince its early days, there have been pessimistic arguments that the Internet is \ninimical to politics and civic participation,6*  even if others have seen in the Internet\u2019s \ncommunicative architecture the birth of a new type of participatory politics.7* More \nrecently, US empirical research has suggested that long-term Internet use and facility \nleads not to more, but to less, sense of online community, as Internet access and use \nbecomes incorporated ever more securely into private routines.8* Against this \nbackground, this article will look closely at the factors which might make a \ndifference, long-term, to the emergence of public, civic zones on the Internet. First, \nhowever, we must examine in more detail the limitations of the \u2018digital divide\u2019 \nconcept as a starting-point for unlocking the ethics of the Internet as information \nspace.  \n \nBeyond the \u2018Digital Divide\u2019 \n \nIn the second half of the 1990s, many national and international organisations became \nexercised by the possibility that new media technologies (above all, the explosive \ngrowth of the Internet and World Wide Web) would widen, not narrow, global \ninequalities. While the main arena for this concern was international, in some cases \n(the US under Clinton, the UK under Blair) this concern was given a national focus as \nwell; if inequalities in access to the Internet, or other media, are most extreme at the \ninternational level, they can hardly be ignored within nations either.   \n \nThe motivation for such concern was always at least partly economic: projected \nexponential growth in markets from the new online connections between consumers \nand businesses became an exponential loss of opportunity, once those who could not \nafford a computer, modem, or even the cost of the local phone call, were taken into \naccount. The gap between early cyberhype and brutal economic reality was so \n                                                          \n6\n See Dan Thu Nguyen and Jon Alexander.

The \nWest\u2019s vision of a virtual consumer revolution needed major adjustment when, as one \nhelpful recent report put it, \u2018a minimum of 676 million households worldwide \u2013 \nalmost all of them in developing countries \u2013 would be unable to afford private rather \nthan public access to telecommunications\u2019,9* let alone computers and operating \nsoftware. Over time, however, rhetoric shifted away from the political liabilities of \n\u2018Digital Divide\u2019 to the more comfortable \u2018Digital Opportunity\u2019, blowing the cover on \nthe market imperatives underlying the former. Leading the way here were the \nproposals submitted by the World Economic Forum to the G-8 Kyushu-Okinawa \n2000 summit, under the title \u2018From The Global Digital Divide to the Global Digital \nOpportunity\u2019. This argued that: \n \n\u2018instead of fixating on the existence of a divide, it would be far better to focus our \nattention on the \u201cglobal digital opportunity\u201d, because that is what really confronts \nus today \u2013 an unprecedented opportunity to move swiftly up the path towards \nglobal digital development . . .\u201910* \n \nin other words, the opportunity not so much to avoid social exclusion and division as \nto expand markets.  \n \nThe more lasting problem with digital divide discourse, however, is its fairly shallow \nunderstanding of the divides to which media technologies can give rise. Inequalities in \nownership of media technologies are discussed, with insufficient (if any) emphasis on \nuse, let alone effective use for the purposes of citizenship. Here is a passage from one \nof the more reflective and considered reports in the field:  \n \n\u2018There are imaginative ways to appeal to children and youths -  through brand \nnames, sport or entertainment stars, kids clubs where they can play or make e-mail \nfriends around the world. Once they are engaged the media can then be used to \npass important information, for example on sexual health, HIV\/AIDS.\u201911* \n \n                                                          \n9\n Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation.

The last \nof the Clinton Administration\u2019s important series of Department of Commerce reports \nunder the title \u2018Falling Through the Net\u2019 announced the achievement of \u2018full digital \ninclusion\u2019 yet acknowledged in passing that its research into the US digital divide had \nlooked purely at access, rather than capacities or quality of use:  \n \n\u2018although this survey did not collect data on the intensity or the quality of Internet \nuse, where an individual uses the Internet \u2013 at home, away from home, or both \u2013 \nprobably reflects some degree of the quality of his or her Internet access\u2019 (added \nemphasis). 12*  \n \nYet buried in this casual admission is an obscure sense (\u2018probably\u2019) that the social \ncontext of Internet access and use matters, in fact matters a great deal.  \n \nRecent British Government reports in this area have been more explicit on this point, \nwith a UK Cabinet Office Report on \u2018Closing the Digital Divide\u2019 acknowledging the \n\u2018urgent need for comprehensive data\u2019 on the relative unwillingness of the most \ndisadvantaged groups to take up new media \u2018opportunities\u2019.13* This last report \nreferences, in passing, an innovative US study by The Children\u2019s Partnership that \nresearched extensively whether \u2018low-income and underserved Americans\u2019 were \nsatisfied with the online content that they accessed. This US report found that \u2018a new \ndimension of the digital divide is beginning to take shape, one with a profound impact \non young people and those who guide and teach them: content\u2019.14* That is, the lack of \naccessible, comprehensible content that would help the disadvantaged to improve \ntheir position (through training courses, job searches and so on), or simply feel a sense \nof community. The same report (page 21) suggested that \u2018appropriate content\u2019 was \nnot enough: people \u2018want to be in a place where others in their community are doing \nthe same thing and where they can count on coaching and support their confidence, \nanswer the questions and guide them in new directions\u2019. Once more, we find that a \nserious attempt to address the digital divide\u2019s policy implications requires attention to \nthe social context of Internet use and the dimensions of social and symbolic exclusion \nagainst which it becomes regular and effective, if at all. This is exactly the conclusion \nof the best recent Internet research, for example Rob Kling\u2019s work on the \u2018next-\n                                                          \n12\n Quotation from Part II, first paragraph under heading \u2018Location of Internet Use\u2019 of US Department \nof Commerce.

Telecommunications is in principle a simpler medium \nthan the Internet, not only because the latter is both interactive and distributive, but \nalso because it is the medium of more complex and open-ended types of use. As \nrecent research has shown, there are enormous differences in what \u2018heavy\u2019 Internet \nusers and \u2018light\u2019 Internet users do when they switch on their computer and modem.16* \nHeavy internet users, particularly those with broadband access, are much more likely \nto spend their time online sending their own documents and information, rather than \nreceiving public information.17* Light internet users, by contrast, may do little more \nthan access their Web server, look at the headlines and a few links, and check a train \ntime via a familiar search route. Are these two uses to be given the same weight in \nmeasuring the digital divide, particularly across a rich and extremely diverse nation \nsuch as the United States? Surely not, nor can such differences be dismissed as \nmatters of individual taste. To assume that would be to ignore the sheer complexity of \nwhat is on offer online. The vast online universe of information and entertainment \ncannot be assumed to be a universal good, having the same value to everyone. The \nuse you or I make of the Internet depends not only on the speed and reliability of our \nmodems and our individual predilections, but on our particular needs and capabilities \nto do something with the resources we believe are available online. This is why The \nChildren\u2019s Partnership report represented such an important step-forward in policy-\nbased research on Internet use; it talked to people about how they used, or did not use, \nthe Internet and how they thought about it. The barriers to effective Internet use may \nbe subtle indeed. \u2018Low-income people think they\u2019re not legitimate information \nproducers\u2019, said one community adviser interviewed by the Children\u2019s Partnership.18 \nSuppose this were true and widespread; it would surely be a barrier to the expansion \nof \u2018full\u2019 internet use. \u2018Social context\u2019 here is a complex matter, inextricably connected \nwith how people think about Internet use, and its actual or possible purpose. \n \nSome historical perspective may be helpful in formulating the issues here. The \nemergence of an information and communication technology is always, in part, the \nslow process through which particular technological possibilities are articulated into \nspecific social and cultural contexts of action, so that merely potential uses become \nnot only actual but stable. But we cannot stop there. For just as important as the \nexplicit contexts of use are the implicit hierarchies that emerge around use: \nhierarchies between spaces of use and non-use, hierarchies between users and non-\n                                                          \n15\n Rob Kling.

As Peter Stallybrass and Allon White argued in relation to the development of a \nEuropean literary elite in the 17 and 18th centuries,19* the printed book and journal did \nnot simply enable new forms of connection (the proto-public sphere of the London \ncoffee-house); it also enabled new forms of social and spatial hierarchy to emerge (the \ncoffee-house versus the market-square). Seen historically, the issue, as Robert \nWuthnow puts it, is how around the technology of the book new \u2018institutional \nframeworks\u2019 emerged for producing and exchanging information and new \u2018action \nsequences\u2019 developed as individuals and groups came to organise their time around \nthe information flows which printed matter made possible.20* We can ask similar \nquestions about the Internet: what, in the longer-term, are the types of institutional \nframework and social and individual habits that will coalesce around the Internet and \nthe changes in information flow it enables? The point is not, of course, to predict the \nfuture (a futile occupation, as Castells emphasises), but, first, to work towards \nformulating what might be the key priorities for empirical research in studying \nInternet use and, second (the particular concern of this article), to formulate the key \nethical questions which possible Internet architectures generate. \n \nIt might seem presumptuous to argue that Internet infrastructure raises ethical issues. \nIs there not a danger, as Pippa Norris has argued in her trenchant account of digital \ndivide debates, of confusing the specific issues raised by the Internet itself (if any) \nand underlying social issues, which are worked out not just through Internet use but \nthrough everything else?21* Certainly, but that does not mean there are no issues \nraised by the infrastructure of the Internet: just as there is in public space generally, so \ntoo on the Internet  there is a politics of speech, which concerns what can (and cannot) \nbe said where.22* The structure and ethics of information space, as with all space, can \nonly be understood in terms of its patterns of presence and absence, connection and \ndisconnection, participation and hierarchy. It is time now to try and make these \nabstract points more specific, working outwards from the questions suggested by the \nconcept of \u2018discursive design\u2019.  \n \nDiscursive Design \n \nAll imported theoretical terms carry historical baggage, but \u2018discursive design\u2019 carries \nmore than most. Its proposal by US political philosopher John Dryzek makes little \nsense initially outside the broad context of critical theory and the specific context of \ndeliberative democracy theory. But, if many aspects of critical theory (particularly the \nwork of Adorno and Horkheimer) remains highly controversial, Jurgen Habermas\u2019 \nconcept of the \u2018public sphere\u201923* has acquired such wide currency that it needs little \n                                                          \n19\n Peter Stallybrass and Allon White.

Deliberative democracy theory which followed in its wake is, of course, \nonly one approach to democracy but it has generated a wide literature in mainstream \npolitical theory debates.24* Indeed its basic principle \u2013 that democracy should be \nbased on the actual participation in important decisions of all those within a polity \naffected by such decisions  - might receive assent in political contexts well beyond the \nacademy. Strikingly, it is just the Internet\u2019s affinity with participative processes that \nled Mark Poster, in its early days,25 to see it as a politically positive medium.  \n \nJohn Dryzek represents, however, a particular strand within deliberative democracy \ntheory, which insists it should not be limited to considering the ideal speech situation \nand the broad principles of democratic participation but must think concretely about \nthe institutional preconditions for any actually existing public sphere. This line of \nargument has force when many critiques of Habermas\u2019 original public sphere model \nclaim it ignored historical and institutional realities.26* Dryzek is not alone27* in \narguing that \u2018critical theorists have so far failed to generate much in the way of model \ninstitutions, still less attempted to apply them to political reality\u2019.28 Dryzek\u2019s concept \nof \u2018discursive design\u2019 is central to his more pragmatic approach. \n \nDefinition \nDryzek defines \u2018discursive design\u2019 as \u2018a social institution around which the \nexpectations of a number of actors converge [which] . . . therefore has a place in their \nconscious awareness as a site for recurrent communicative interaction among them . . \n. as citizens, not as representatives of the state or any other corporate or hierarchical \nbody\u2019.29 The questions for us here therefore are: will Internet space emerge as a \n\u2018discursive design\u2019 in this sense and thereby contribute to deliberative democracy? \nWhat are the infrastructural conditions for, and potentially against, such a \ndevelopment?  \n \nSince I am using \u2018discursive design\u2019 only as a starting-point for a wider series of \nquestions, I will not offer an exhaustive exposition, but some introductory points need \nto be made. First, the term \u2018communicative interaction\u2019 is a term of art about which a \ngreat deal could be said: suffice to say that the consensus among deliberative \ndemocracy theorists remains that a crucial component of \u2018communicative interaction\u2019 \nis rationally-based argument on matters of general, not merely individual, \n                                                          \n24\n For an important recent collection, see Seyla Benhabib, editor, Democracy and Difference.

As recent debates have brought out,30 Habermas\u2019 original insistence on \nexclusively rational debate was too restricting and ignored the mixture of emotion and \nrationality which characterises most important real-world discussions, but the central \nimportance of some, and indeed an orientating, focus on agreement achieved through \nrational argument remains. Second, Dryzek assumes that there should be \u2018a social \ninstitution around which the expectations of a number of actors converge\u2019 (added \nemphasis). Once again, recent debates have softened Habermas\u2019 original insistence \nthat even in a complex society there should be one, and one only, central site that we \ncan call the \u2018public sphere\u2019, where citizens meet to deliberate: both Habermas in his \nlater work and his follower Seyla Benhabib accept now that the real public sphere is \nmuch more like an interlocking network of sites rather than one central site.31* \nDryzek\u2019s stipulation that people\u2019s expectations \u2018converge\u2019 around one site is \nsufficiently loose to accommodate a network of sites. Third, note the importance \nDryzek attaches to people meeting \u2018as citizens\u2019 and not as \u2018representatives of the state \nor any other corporate or hierarchical body\u2019. A principle of critical theory is that \nparticipatory processes happen not under the aegis of the state but in public spaces \nprecisely not controlled by major public institutions: this distinguishes it from \ndemocratic theories which prioritise state-focussed processes such as elections. In its \nanti-statism, deliberative democracy theory shares an important principle with some \nother influential recent writing about Internet architecture, notably Lawrence Lessig\u2019s \nwork.32* Fourth, Dryzek in amplifying his definition makes an important point about \nthe extent and nature of deliberation in any discursive design: \u2018all [its] features should \nbe redeemable within the discursive design itself. Participants should be free to \nreflectively and discursively override any of all of them\u2019.33 Less technically, Dryzek is \nsaying that the deliberative process which a discursive design enables should extend \nto questions of the discursive design\u2019s own structure: compare my earlier point that  \nquestions of the Internet\u2019s architecture and infrastructure need to remain open to \nethical deliberation, rather than being black-boxed. \n \nResulting Questions  \nWhat questions are we led to formulate about the ethics of the Internet as information \nspace, once we assume that, in part at least, the Internet should function as a \ndiscursive design? I would identify six main areas of questions to be pursued \nempirically and in terms of their ethical consequences. \n \n1. Convergence. Does or can the Internet (or any part of the Internet) operate as a \nsite around which people\u2019s expectations of communicative interaction converge? \nAt one level of course yes: there is much general expectation about the Internet as \na new communicative medium. But this gives too little weight to the term \n\u2018converge\u2019 in Dryzek\u2019s definition. The key question, at the level of what (for \nconvenience) I will loosely call \u2018Internet architecture\u2019, is about the scale and \n                                                          \n30\n See the essays by Benhabib and Young in Benhabib, op. cit. \n31\n See essay by Benhabib in Benhabib op. cit. See also Jurgen Habermas, Between Facts and Norms. \nMIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1996. \n32\n Lawrence Lessig, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace. Basic Books, New York, 1999, page 208. \n33\n Dryzek, ibid.  \n 11\neffectiveness of convergence: this translates into more specific questions about the \nstrength of connections between particular sites and the strength of disconnections \nbetween others. One major fear about the Internet is that Internet architecture \nencourages divergence, not convergence, of social experience, because of its \nstimulus to increasingly specialised (and exclusive) forms of social connection \nand information exchange.34* Clearly the question of the net balance between \nconnections and disconnections is a matter for (complex) empirical research, not \ntheory, but it is surely a question of ethical significance. \n \n2. Who converges? The second question develops the first, and sharpens the \ndistinction between apparent and real convergence. Dryzek\u2019s actual definition is \nvague (\u2018a number of actors converge\u2019) but a key principle is, as he notes, that \u2018no \nconcerned individuals should be excluded and if necessary some educative \nmechanism should promote competent participation of persons with a material \ninterest in the issues at hand who might otherwise be left out\u2019.35 In other words, so \nas far as possible, all citizens should have access to, and effectively participate in, \nsuch an information space. Here, we return to issues raised by digital divide \ndebates, but with the proviso that the criterion of adequate access\/use is whether \npeople effectively represent their material interests, a much higher criterion than \nthe basic level of access and use that most digital divide discussion implies.  \nWe can ask therefore: what are the conditions that support or hinder effective \nparticipation in online deliberations by all members of a society? Of course, as \nNorris argues, there is an overlap here with issues of social inequality which have \nnothing inherently to do with Internet architecture: economic resources, education, \nstatus, and so on. That does not mean Internet architecture raises no issues: for, if \nin everyday practice, people across the board consistently use the Internet as if it \nwere not a space of convergence, but only an infinite information resource from \nwhich they as individuals can draw whatever materials they like, as and when they \nlike, and if that practice is reinforced by the formats through which \u2018the Internet\u2019 \nis presented for use to people in everyday situations, then there is an issue about \nInternet architecture as it is lived to be addressed. If all the signs and routes in a \nbuilding point away from the central space where people could, if they went there, \nmeet to discuss what is happening in that building, then that is a question of \narchitecture with consequences for how that building operates as an information \nspace. In the case of the Internet, it is therefore worth asking; does the Internet \noverall operate as a centripetal or centrifugal space and, if the latter, what are the \nconsequences for politics and social organisation of what is potentially societies\u2019 \nprincipal communication space operating that way? \n \n3. Deliberation. The next question follows on from a possible response to the last \npoint: aren\u2019t there many sites on the Internet where people are currently \nconverging in unprecedented fashion to discuss matters of public concern, such as \nthe adequacy of public provision for particular private health issues? In turn, we \ncan pose the question of whether what people do on those sites is truly \n\u2018deliberation by citizens\u2019 as the definition of discursive design requires. People \nmust come together to debate matters of general interest aware that they do so in \n                                                          \n34\n See Trend, op. cit.; cf Cass Susstein, Republic.com. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1999. \n35\n Dryzek, ibid. \n 12\nthe capacity of citizens, that is, not just as private individuals but as people who \nsee their deliberations as having wider public relevance.  \nConsidering Nina Eliasoph\u2019s recent empirical work36 on everyday talk about \npublic issues in the US helps bring out the implications of this point for empirical \nresearch on online sites. Her central point is that, beneath the surface of the US \npopulation\u2019s apparent decline in interest in politics, is a more complex picture: \npeople do talk about citizenship issues but in private, that is, in spaces where there \nare no public consequences of their talk. In public spaces, by contrast, \u2018politics\u2019 is \navoided as too contentious. This is an issue about how people imagine both the \nspaces where they speak and the unwritten constraints (built into those spaces) \nabout what can appropriately said and where. In the case of Internet discussion \nsites, how do people actually imagine the space in which they are speaking: is it \none where talk about formal politics is inappropriate and if so why? Or, more \nsubtly, is it a space where political or civic talk is appropriate, but only because \ntalk there has no public consequences? We return here to the question of \nconnection and disconnection across Internet space. Deliberation is not just talk, \nbut public talk about public issues consciously aimed to have wider public impact, \nand accountable as such. \n \n4. Public action. The fourth question builds on the last. We are concerned with the \npossibility that in Internet space there might be some sites where public debate not \nonly occurs, but occurs in a context where it can plausibly lead to \nrecommendations for public action. Deliberation within the definition of \ndiscursive design must be more than a talking-shop without consequences. This \nleads to specific empirical questions about how particular online sites of \ndeliberation (if any) are connected, or not, into wider processes of public decision-\nmaking and action.  \n \n5. Relations to the State. The fifth question applies the fourth. What relationship \ndoes online deliberation have to the actions of the main actor in public space, the \nstate (similar questions could be asked of the interface with corporate power)? We \ncan have as thriving a world of online deliberation as we like, but if its \nrecommendations are systematically ignored by the state, it will achieve little. \nMuch of what states do, of course, falls outside questions of Internet architecture \n(and squarely within political science), but again there are ethical questions to \nwhich Internet architecture gives rise. What is the strength of connections between \nonline discussion sites and state processes (whether online or offline)? Are there \nhierarchies among online sites, such that deliberation in certain places has no \nchance of reaching government, whereas deliberation elsewhere online has a good \nchance? Such questions are almost embarrassingly general, but this reflects a real \ngap in knowledge and policy.  \nAs illustration of this, consider this interesting passage from a recent report issued \non behalf of the UK government:  \n \n\u2018Active and engaged citizens are likely to lead to more effective and informed \ngovernment. That there is a high level of interest in political issues is borne out by \nsuccessive opinion polls. Individuals already participate in a variety of activities \nthat have no formal connection with the institutions of democracy.  The task for \n                                                          \n36\n Eliasoph, op. cit. \n 13\ngovernment is to link this interest to the political process \u2013 and to do so in a way \nthat reflects and responds to changes in the nature of democratic participation. . . . \n[However] The notion of a formal space on the web where anyone can initiate \npolicy ideas, contribute evidence or debate with others is a long way off.\u201937* \n \nThe evidential gap to which this passage refers is borne out if you visit the current \nversion of the UK Government\u2019s own experiment in e-democracy, CitizenSpace, \nat www.ukonline.gov.uk\/. You might well want first to click on \u2018how to contribute \neffectively\u2019. But if you do, the first instruction you get is \u2018Be Brief\u2019, \u2018use one short \nsentence to explain each point you want to make\u2019 \u2013 hardly an encouragement to \nopen-ended deliberation!38  \n \n6. Long-Term Patterns of Practice. We have posed each of the first five questions \nstill fairly abstractly. But, if we have learned anything from digital divide debates \nit is that abstract formulation is ultimately fruitless unless we translate such \nquestions into more specific questions about people\u2019s long-term practices of using \nthe Internet, their habits not only of doing certain things but also of thinking about \nwhat they do online in a certain way, as one type of process (say, public \ndeliberation) rather than another. We need then to look at the broader patterns of \nInternet use, and how they become embedded in particular understandings of what \nthe Internet is. There are of course many actual Internets, 39* not just one \nhomogenous space, and our sense of \u2018the Internet\u2019 is variously constructed by \ndifferent people. That does not, however, resolve the question. We must look, as \nsuggested earlier, for patterns not just of presence, but also of absence. What long-\nterm differences will emerge between (I) heavy Internet users and less heavy users \nor non-users, and (ii) between certain user groups and others, in terms of how each \nacts in relation to, and thinks of, the Internet as a \u2018discursive design\u2019, that is, as a \nspace where they can converge to deliberate effectively on issues of shared \nconcern? Will the Internet, from this perspective, become in the longer-term a \nuniverse of \u2018secessionary networked spaces\u2019 (in the words of two of the most \ntrenchant critics of contemporary cities) with a limited number of highly-lit \n\u2018colonies of cohesion\u2019 and vast dark spaces of low or zero connection in-\nbetween?40*   \nAnd, switching our focus from the purely empirical, if, in the longer-term, Internet \nuse becomes divided between a small minority for whom the Internet is (in part) a \ndiscursive design, effectively linked to their notion of civic life, and a large \nmajority for whom the Internet is a purely private resource, and if states adapt \ntheir notions of e-government around what the former group do (or don\u2019t do) \n                                                          \n37\n UK Government, Office of the e-Envoy.

Does this social space have \nanything in common with the type of space (a discursive design) which deliberative \ndemocracy theorists suggest is necessary for a participatory democracy?  \n \nThis is to assume, admittedly, that the Internet needs, in part, to take on the features of \na discursive design, which depends on two further undefended premises: first, that we \nneed spaces which answer to the definition of a discursive design and second, that the \nInternet will become an increasingly important part of societies\u2019 overall public \ncommunication space. The second is uncontroversial, but the first is not, indeed it is a \npolitical value. It judges the Internet in the same fashion that many previous writers \nhave judged public space, for example the architecture and spatial organisation of our \nmajor cities. Just as one generation of social commentators asked whether modern \nurban public spaces contributed to, or undermined, the conditions necessary for an \nethical life, so we can ask the same question of the public (not necessarily civic) space \ninto which the Internet is being transformed. Borrowing the terms of Richard \nSennett\u2019s devastating 1970s critique of US mediated public life,41* will the Internet, \nover the long term, become \u2018dead space\u2019, merely the \u2018means of passage to the \ninterior\u2019? Or will it become a true public space, alive with discussion, debate and \ncollective action? Partly these are questions of politics and the whole direction of \npublic discourse and narrative. But, as Sennett has consistently shown, such questions \nof discourse can never be divorced from the architecture and spatial infrastructure \nwithin which people live their public and private lives, and imagine both the \nboundaries and the connections between them.  It is in this sense that the Internet, as \ninformation space, raises urgent and still unanswered questions not just for \ninformation science, but for political science, sociology and ethics as well.  \n[6283 words] \n \nReferences \n \nSeyla Benhabib, editor, Democracy and Difference.
