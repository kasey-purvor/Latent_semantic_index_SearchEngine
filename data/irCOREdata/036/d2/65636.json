Defamilisation has \nemerged as a potentially important concept in this context, as it enables the comparison and \nclassification of welfare states in terms of how they facilitate female autonomy and economic \nindependence from the family. However, the methodology used or the understanding of the \nconcept, limits existing defamilisation typologies. These typologies have therefore been \nunable to provide an accurate examination of welfare state variation using this concept and, \nindeed, have in some ways undermined and devalued the usefulness of defamilisation. This \narticle uses cluster analysis to build upon previous research and resurrect the concept of \ndefamilisation. In contrast to existing work in this area, the analysis produces a five-fold \ntypology of welfare state regimes. This typology differs in many ways from existing models \nof welfare state regimes, although some core countries emerge as regime ideal types. The \narticle concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of cluster analysis, and \ndefamilisation, for welfare state modelling and future research in this area. \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nWelfare state modelling is a longstanding strand within the comparative social policy \nliterature (Cutright, 1965; Esping-Andersen, 1990; Therborn, 1987; Titmus, 1974; Wilensky, \n1975; Wilensky & Lebraux, 1958) and there is now a burgeoning amount of work (Pierson, \n1998) about welfare state regimes and welfare state typologies (see Table 1). One of the most \nextensive critiques of this modelling has been made on the basis of gender (Bambra 2004; \nBorchost, 1994; Bussemaker & Kersbergen, 1994; Daly, 1994; Gornick & Jacobs, 1998; \nHobson, 1994; Langan & Ostner, 1991; Lewis, 1992; Lewis & Ostner, 1995; O\u2019Connor, \n1996; Orloff, 1993; Sainsbury, 1994, 1999; Siaroff, 1994; Trifiletti, 1999) as welfare \ntypologies have assumed an overtly genderless, but covertly androcentric, approach \n(Sainsbury, 1994) and have thereby ignored gender as a form of social stratification (Arts & \nGelissen, 2002). The few attempts at modelling that have acknowledged that relationships \nwith, and experiences of, welfare states are mitigated by gender (Siaroff, 1994) have \ntraditionally fallen into one of three types: \u2018gendering\u2019 existing welfare state typologies, such \nas the work of Orloff (1993) or O\u2019Connor (1996) on Esping-Andersen\u2019s three worlds \ntypology (Esping-Andersen, 1990, 1999); highlighting aspects of welfare state models that \nalso work for women (Gornick & Jacobs, 1998; Trifiletti, 1999); or creating alternative more \ngender focused systems of welfare state classification (Lewis, 1992; Siaroff, 1994; Lewis & \nOstner, 1995; Sainsbury, 1999; Pascall & Lewis, 2004). Prominent within this latter approach \nare Lewis\u2019s breadwinner model (Lewis, 1992; Lewis & Ostner, 1995; Pascall & Lewis, 2004) \nand Sainsbury\u2019s (1999) work on public childcare provision. However, these approaches have \ntended to be limited by the focus on only one indicator, a small number of countries or a \nstatic, qualitative concept (Esping-Andersen, 1999). This has led to the more recent \ndevelopment of \u2018defamilisation\u2019 typologies (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, 2000; Author \nreference, 2004). \n 4 \nTable 1 in about here  \nThe concept of defamilisation is often defined as \u2018the degree to which individual adults can \nuphold a socially acceptable standard of living, independently of family relationships, either \nthrough paid work or through social security provisions\u2019 (Lister, 1997: 173). This concept \nacknowledges that often, \u2018the functional equivalent of market dependency for many women is \nfamily dependency\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1999: 45). Defamilisation can therefore be utilised as \na way of testing the extent to which welfare states, and welfare state regimes, facilitate female \nautonomy and economic independence from the family. The concept has been used \nintermittently within welfare state modelling (Taylor-Gooby, 1996; Esping-Andersen, 1999; \nPascall & Manning, 2000; Korpi, 2000; Author reference, 2004). However, it has often been \ninaccurately defined and operationalised by commentators as the extent to which welfare \nstates decommodify the family. For example, both Esping-Andersen (1999) and Korpi (2000) \nutilise this conceptualisation of defamilisation and their typologies subsequently rely either on \nfactors that assess the extent to which welfare states support the family (Esping-Andersen, \n1999) or on different family models (Korpi, 2000). Korpi\u2019s family support typology and \nEsping-Andersen\u2019s attempt to operationalise defamilisation are problematic because, instead \nof examining the extent to which welfare states facilitate women\u2019s autonomy and \nindependence, their work actually assesses the extent to which welfare states support the \nfamily. For example, Korpi measures the type of family support provided by different welfare \nstates, not the support given specifically to women. Similarly, Esping-Andersen is essentially \nconcerned with the decommodification of family life, the extent to which the welfare state \nenables the family to survive independently of the market. It is perhaps therefore not very \nsurprising that the results of these two approaches to defamilisation closely match Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s (1990) original \u2018androgynous\u2019 three worlds of welfare typology (see Table 1).   \n \n 5 \nAn alternative definition of defamilisation, one that is much more related to the broader \ngender-based critique of welfare state modelling outlined earlier, has been operationalised in a \nprevious article by this author (2004). Drawing on Taylor-Gooby (1996), this definition of \ndefamilisation refers to the extent to which the welfare state enables women to survive as \nindependent workers and decreases the economic importance of the family in women\u2019s lives.  \nDefamilisation in this conceptualisation is therefore concerned with women\u2019s freedom from \nthe family, rather than the freedom of the family (Author reference, 2004). Subsequently, and \nunlike the defamilisation of Korpi or Esping-Andersen, it was not just about family policy but \nabout the extent to which the broader welfare state environment facilitates the participation of \nwomen in society. That is not to say that policies aimed at the family itself (such as public \nprovision of childcare) will not also have an indirect effect on women\u2019s independence from \nthe family, but that this particular conceptualisation of defamilisation focuses purely on the \ncontext in which the position of women is or is not promoted. In the previous article (Bambra, \n2004), this author used four factors to create a defamilisation index that measured the \nrelationship between women, the state and the family: (1) Relative female labour participation \nrate; (2) Maternity leave compensation; (3) Compensated maternity leave duration; and (4) \nAverage female wage. However, the resulting defamilisation typology again broadly \nconfirmed Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds\u2019 typology with the production of three groupings \nof welfare states with broadly similar country compositions (Table 1).  \n \nThis earlier work thereby suggested that taking a more overtly gendered approach to welfare \nstate modelling had little impact on the resulting typology and was perhaps therefore an \nunnecessary endeavour (Author reference, 2004). However, this operationalisation of \ndefamilisation was extremely problematic as it copied the Esping-Andersen methodology of \nindex-based regime construction (Esping-Andersen, 1990). Esping-Andersen\u2019s method has \n 6 \nbeen subject to extensive methodological criticism particularly, around the additive nature of \nthe indexes and the reliance upon averaging (Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, 1994; \nRagin, 1994; Pitruzello, 1999), the use of weighting (Fawcett and Papadopoulos, 1997; \nAuthor reference, 2006), and also for the use of one standard deviation around the mean to \nclassify the countries into regimes (Fawcett and Papadopoulos, 1997; Author reference, 2006) \nwhich meant that the resulting typology could only ever be three-fold:  regime classification is \neither above (high\/Social Democratic), below (low\/Liberal), or between (medium\/ \nConservative) one standard deviation around the mean (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 54). In this \nway a four- or five-fold classification of welfare states is methodologically impossible \n(Papadopoulos, 1998; Author reference, 2006). In replicating this method, the results of the \nearlier (Bambra, 2004) defamilisation typology were of limited value, not least because it was \nimpossible to produce anything other than three regimes. However, it is important that the \nwoman-focused definition of defamilisation used within this work is not also undermined by \nthe methodological problems of index construction or how the resulting typology was \ninterpreted. The concept remains as a useful means of comparing both between and within \nwelfare states in terms of women\u2019s independence and it also reflects the broader and now \nlargely unacknowledged gender criticism of welfare state modelling.  \n \nThe concept of defamilisation retains much value for welfare state modelling and comparative \nsocial policy. It is the purpose of this article therefore to resurrect the defamilisation concept \nfor welfare state modelling by using a more robust method of classification: cluster analysis \n(Kangas, 1994; Pitruzzello, 1999; Gough, 2001). The resulting welfare state typology(s) will \nbe then compared with the original defamilisation typology (Author reference, 2004), other \ndefamilisation typologies (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, 2000), and mainstream welfare \n 7 \nstate classifications (Table 1). The article will conclude by reflecting on the broader \nimplications of the analysis for welfare state modelling and future research in this area. \n \nMethods \nCluster analysis, despite having many obvious benefits for welfare state classification, is a \nsurprisingly under-used approach in comparative social policy (Gough, 2001).  In cluster \nanalysis, countries are classified on the basis of the combination of predetermined selection \ncriterion (defamilisation factors) so that each country in a cluster is similar to the others in \nthat cluster and different from countries in the other clusters (Gough, 2001; Grimm and \nYarnold, 2000). In this way, the clusters represent different regime types. There are two more \ncommonly used forms of cluster analysis: hierarchical and K-means (Pitruzzello, 1999; \nGough, 2001). Hierarchical cluster analysis locates the closest pair of countries and combines \nthem to form a pair, this \u2013 joining cases into pairs or joining two pairs \u2013 continues until all \ncases are in one cluster. Once countries are joined in a cluster they remain joined throughout \nthe rest of the analysis (Gough, 2001; Cramer, 2003). In this way, the clusters emerge from \nthe data, facilitating the emergence of welfare state taxonomies. However, hierarchical cluster \nanalysis is rather atheoretical and so it is often conducted alongside K-means cluster analysis \n(Pitruzzello, 1999; Gough, 2001; Grimm and Yarnold, 2000; Cramer, 2003). K-means enables \nthe a priori specification of the number of clusters to be formed (Gough, 2001). This has a \nsecondary benefit for the classification of welfare states on the basis of defamilisation, as it \nenables the testing of the number of different types of welfare state regimes (3, 4, 5) \nsuggested by the welfare state modelling literature (see Table 1). All calculations in this \narticle use squared Euclidean distance and scale standardised versions of the defamilisation \nfactors. Analysis was carried out using SPSS version 11.0. \n \n 8 \nThe analysis uses three of the original four measures of defamilisation (Author reference, \n2004): (1) Relative female economic activity rate (expressed as the difference between the \nfemale and male economic activity rate and thereby controlling for variations in national \neconomic activity rates); (2) Maternity leave compensation; and (3) Compensated maternity \nleave duration. The original fourth factor \u2013 average female wage expressed as a percentage of \nmale average wage (Author reference, 2004) \u2013 has been excluded from the cluster analysis for \ntwo reasons: firstly, there was no data for four (Canada, Italy, Spain and the USA) of the \ntwenty-one countries used in this new analysis (see Table 2); and secondly, it was \nsignificantly correlated (r -.659, p=0.01) with factor one \u2013 relative female economic activity \nrate  \u2013 and the results of cluster analysis are undermined by multicolinearity (Grimm and \nYarnold, 2000). It should be noted that the first measure, relative economic activity rate, \ndiffers only slightly from the relative labour market participation rate used in the earlier \nanalysis (Bambra, 2004).  \n \nThese quantitative indicators were \u2018specifically selected to highlight a certain aspect of how \nthe welfare state undermines female dependency on the family and facilitates their economic \nindependence\u2019 (Bambra, 2004: 204). Relative female labour participation rate has been \nchosen because it indicates the extent to which the economy of the welfare state facilitates \nfemale employment. It is \u2018relative\u2019 because it is measured in relation to male employment \nlevels, thus reducing the influence of different national unemployment rates. This factor \nprovides a measure of one way in which women gain economic independence from the \nfamily, enter the public realm and gain access to certain social rights (Meyer, 1994: 67\u201368). \nMaternity leave compensation and compensated maternity leave duration are intended to \nshow whether the welfare state provides economic support when women decide to have \nchildren or if it encourages reliance on the family. Maternity leave compensation shows the \n 9 \nlevel of replacement income that women receive when they are absent from work due to \npregnancy, whereas compensated maternity leave duration indicates the length of time for \nwhich women can take paid maternity leave (Bambra, 2004).  \nTable 2 in about here  \n \nThe data for the defamilisation factors relate to twenty-one countries: Australia, Austria, \nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \nNorway, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK and the \nUSA. These countries represent the original eighteen OCED countries used by Esping-\nAndersen (1990) and later by Castles and Mitchell (1993), plus the Mediterranean countries \nadded by Leibfreid (1992), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997). This analysis therefore offers a \nbroader range of countries than previous defamilisation (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, \n2000; Author reference, 2004) or gender-focused typologies (Lewis, 1992; Lewis & Ostner, \n1995; Pascall & Lewis, 2004; Sainsbury, 1999; Siaroff, 1994). Data were obtained from the \nUnited Nations (UN, 2005) for the years 2003 and 2004. The data is therefore much more \nrecent than that used in other typologies [e.g. Bambra (2004) uses data from 1996 and 1997]. \n \nResults \nThe unstandardised data for each of the defamilisation measures are outlined in Table 2 and \nFigures 1 to 3 show the spread of country scores for each of the three measures. Patterns are \nevident even in these univariate graphics, e.g. the Nordic countries have the lowest relative \nfemale economic activity rate showing that the gap between male and female economic \nactivity is the least in these countries (Figure 1) and they are amongst the highest countries in \nterms of maternity leave compensation rates and compensation duration (Figures 2 and 3). \nThe positioning of the other countries is rather more mixed, but Australia and the USA exhibit \n 10 \nextremely low scores for maternity leave compensation rates and compensation duration \n(Figures 2 and 3), although the gap in these countries between male and female economic \nactivity is comparatively small (Figure 1).  \nFigures 1-3 in about here  \n \nThe results of the hierarchical cluster analysis are shown in the proximity matrix (Table 3) \nand the first dendrogram (Figure 4). The proximity matrix reveals the distances between the \ncountries when they are clustered using the three defamilisation measures. Certain countries \nare very closely located and are quickly clustered to one another: e.g. Austria, Germany, The \nNetherlands, New Zealand, France and Portugal are all less than 0.1 in distance from one \nanother. This suggests that these countries are very similar in terms of the combined \ndefamilisation variate. Similarly, other countries pair up at an early stage of the analysis. For \nexample, Belgium and Switzerland are 0.2 apart, Greece and Spain are 0 in distance, and \nAustralia and the USA are also 0 in terms of distance from one another. Other countries are \nclearly more seperate from one another, e.g. Japan and Finland are 11.6 away from one \nanother, and Canada and Spain are 6.3 apart. Perhaps most notably, the proximity matrix \nreveals that the pairings of Sweden and Norway, and Australia and the USA are very distant \nfrom the rest of the matrix. Sweden and Norway are 2.2 away from one another but they are \nvery distant from the other countries; Norway is closest to Denmark, but this is still at a \ndistance of 5.2; and Sweden is even more distant as, aside from Norway, the countries closest \nto Sweden are Finland, at a distance of 10.4 and Denmark at 12.3.  Similarly, Australia and \nthe USA are 0 away from one another but the closest other country to Australia is Canada at a \ndistance of 5.0, and for the USA, the closest countries are Canada at 4.8 and the UK at 5.8.  \nThese two pairings represent the extremes of the proximity matrix, as they are most distant \nfrom one another: Sweden is 31.4 away for Australia and 30.8 away from the USA; and the \n 11 \ndistance between the USA and Norway is 23.8 and the distance between Norway and \nAustralia is 24.2. This is unsurprising given the polarised scores of these countries, especially \nfor the maternity related variables (as shown in the univariate graphics Figures 1-3). \nTable 3, Figure 4 in about here  \n \nThe dendrogram (Figure 4) also highlights the separation of Sweden and Norway, and \nAustralia and the USA from the other countries. They do not combine with any of the other \ncountries or clusters until the last stages of the combination process. The graphical \npresentation of the dendrogram also suggests that the hierarchical analysis of defamilisation \nproduces a typology of five welfare state clusters (three broad clusters plus the outlying \npairs). The largest cluster consists of Austria, The Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, \nFrance and Portugal, which are later joined by the pairing of Belgium and Switzerland, and \nIreland. The second cluster starts with the pair of Greece and Spain; these are then combined \nwith Italy, and later Japan. Cluster three combines the pairs of Denmark and Finland and \nCanada and the UK. The fourth cluster consists of the pairing of Australia and the USA, and \nthe final cluster is that of Sweden and Norway. Interestingly, when the hierarchical analysis is \nrerun without the cases of Australia, USA, Sweden and Norway, the three other clusters \nremain fairly static and the only real changes are that Japan, Italy and particularly the UK are \nmade more distant from the other cases (see Figure 5). This reinforces the fact that in the \nanalysis of all twenty-one countries, the four cases (Australia, Norway, Sweden and the USA) \nare very distant from the others, but it also suggests that they are not overly influencing the \nnature of the other clusters.  \nFigure 5 in about here  \n \n 12 \nThe K-means cluster analysis is used to examine further the five-fold typology produced by \nthe hierarchical cluster analysis, and also to test the different number of welfare state regime \ntypes suggested by the mainstream welfare state modelling literature (as outlined in Table 1). \nK-means was conducted for K=2, K=3, K=4 and K=5. The typologies produced by the \nvarious K-means analysis are presented in Table 4. Overall, the K-means confirms a large \ndegree of the results of the hierarchical analysis, as certain countries are clustered together \nthroughout the analysis regardless of the changing number of clusters: Sweden and Norway, \nGreece, Spain, Italy and Japan, and Austria, The Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, France \nand Portugal. Sweden and Norway remain isolated together throughout the K-means, even in \nK=2. However, the USA and Australia are initially joined with other cases, most notably \nCanada, until they too are separated out at K=4. Furthermore, in K=4 and K=5 the clusters \nvery closely resemble those produced by the hierarchical analysis. For example, in K=4, \nGreece, Spain, Italy and Japan, which formed cluster two in the hierarchical analysis, are also \ntogether in cluster three. Although in K=5 they separate, with Spain and Greece joining \ncluster two, it should be noted that some countries are closer to the cluster centre than others \nand that Greece is 1.01 away from the centre and Spain 1.18. This suggests that they are less \ncentral to that cluster than other cases that exhibit smaller distances such as The Netherlands, \nAustria or Germany. Similarly, the largest cluster identified by the hierarchical analysis \nremains relatively intact across the various K-means analysis, and at K=5 only Ireland is \nabsent from the comparable cluster two. The only other country to fall into a different cluster \nthan expected from the hierarchical analysis is Denmark which is in cluster two in K=5 rather \nthan alongside Finland, Canada and the UK in cluster four. It should be noted that Denmark is \nthe country furthest away from the centre of cluster two (1.4). This means that there are \nactually only four countries with different cluster memberships under the K=5 than that found \nin the hierarchical analysis: Denmark, Ireland, Greece and Spain.  \n 13 \nTable 4 in about here \n \nThe K-means analysis therefore provides further support for the existence of a five-fold \ndefamilisation typology. The K-means also provides other useful information about the \nclusters, as an examination of the distances between countries and the five cluster centres \nshows that some cases form the basis of a particular cluster, whilst others are less closely \nidentified with it. Countries central to a cluster are: the USA in cluster one (distance from \ncentre 0), Austria and The Netherlands in cluster two (distance from centre 0), Japan in cluster \nthree (distance 0), the UK in cluster four (distance 0), and Sweden in cluster five (distance 0).  \nOthers countries are less closely associated with the cluster in which they end up, e.g. \nexample, Denmark (1.4), Greece (1.01) and Spain (1.18) in cluster two, Finland (1.84) in \ncluster four and Norway (1.47) in cluster five. This suggests that some countries are harder to \nclassify than others and that their cluster membership is more fluid. It also suggests that \ncertain core countries are fundamentally different from one another in terms of the combined \ndefamilisation variate and therefore form the basis of distinct clusters. \n \nTable 5 shows the final cluster centres and how each of the three defamilisation measures \ncontributes to discrimination between the clusters. The F-statistic (calculated using analysis of \nvariance) shows which of these measures contributes the most to discriminating between the \nclusters (the larger the F-statistic the larger the discriminating power of the variable). For \nexample, in the five cluster typology (K=5) the economic activity variable has a negative \ninfluence on clusters one, three and four but a positive influence on clusters two and five, and \nthe maternity leave compensation variable has a negative influence on clusters one, four and \nfive but a positive influence on clusters two and three. The maternity leave duration variable \ncontributed the most to discriminating between the clusters in all of the typologies: \n 14 \n(respectively F=83.28, F=50.83, F=76.58, F=75.64), although in K=5, the maternity \ncompensation variable began to exert more influence (F=46.23). Table 6 shows the distances \nbetween the final cluster centres and thereby indicates the extent to which they are similar or \ndifferent from one another. In the five-fold typology, clusters two (Austria, The Netherlands \netc.) and five (Norway and Sweden) are most similar to one another (1.48). Interestingly, the \ntwo most distant clusters are not one (USA and Australia) and five (Sweden and Norway), but \none and three (Ireland, Italy and Japan) at a distance of 5.20. \nTables 5-6 in about here  \n \nDiscussion \nThe results of the hierarchical and K-means cluster analysis were very similar and therefore \nfairly conclusive: when analysed using cluster analysis, defamilisation produces a five-fold \ntypology of welfare states with three broad clusters and two pairs (see Table 7). This \nundermines the three-fold typologies of Esping-Andersen (1990; 1999), Korpi (2000) and \nBambra (2004), and lends support to those that assert the existence of more than three regime \ntypes (Leibfreid, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Korpi and \nPalme, 1998; Pitruzzello, 1999). This analysis particularly reinforces the decommodification \ncluster analysis of Pitruzzello which also found in favour of a five-fold classification of \nwelfare states (1999). However, the country clusters produced by the defamilisation analysis \nand the regimes within the literature typologies differ substantially in content (Table 7 \ncompared with Table 1): generally within the welfare state modelling literature, the Nordic \ncountries are clustered together (Social Democratic); the Anglo-Saxon countries are placed in \neither one (Liberal) or two (Liberal and Radical) regimes; and the Continental European \ncountries and Japan are placed into one (Conservative), two (Conservative and Latin), or three \n(Conservative, Latin and Bismarckian) regime types. There are only minor similarities \n 15 \nbetween these regimes and the defamilisation clusters, most notably the existence of a broad \nContinental cluster (cluster two in Table 7). However, the overall picture is very different \nfrom that expected from the mainstream welfare state regime literature, and the clusters also \ndiffer significantly from previous analyses conducted using the concept of defamilisation. All \nthree previous defamilisation typologies (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, 2000; Bambra, \n2004) promoted a three-fold division of welfare states and, even allowing for the fact they \nonly used eighteen countries compared with the twenty-one in the cluster analysis, there is \nvery little overall similarity between their results and those presented here, not least because \nthe defamilisation cluster analysis resulted in a five-fold division of welfare states.  \nTable 7 in about here  \n \nHowever, on closer examination, it is clear that very few of the mainstream typologies \nactually agree with one another over the exact classifications of all countries: of the seven \nmainstream typologies outlined in Table 1 (Bonoli, 1997; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Esping-\nAndersen, 1990; Ferrera, 1996; Korpi & Palme, 1998; Leibfreid, 1992; Pitruzzello, 1999), \nonly seven country classifications are really agreed upon by all seven (plus Greece, Spain and \nPortugal by those that include them): Canada and the USA; Germany (and to a lesser extent \nThe Netherlands); Norway and Sweden (and to a lesser extent Denmark). Similarly, the \ndefamilisation typologies of Esping-Andersen (1999), Korpi (2000), and Author reference \n(2004), whilst all concluding in favour of a three-fold typology of welfare states, only actually \nagree on the positioning of nine countries (fifty per cent of the cases examined): Australia, \nNew Zealand and the UK; France, Germany and Italy, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This \nsuggests that some countries are considered to be more core to certain regime types than \nothers, and that the regime membership of the majority of cases is disputed. This has \nimportant implications for the interpretation of the results of the defamilisation cluster \n 16 \nanalysis. Both the hierarchical and the K-means cluster analysis resulted in a five-fold \ntypology but within each of the clusters, it is clear that some countries are more central than \nothers. For example, cluster one consists of only the USA and Australia; in cluster two \nGermany, Austria and The Netherlands are the core countries (closest in distance to the \ncluster centre \u2013 see Table 4); in cluster three it is Japan, for cluster four it is the UK; and \ncluster five again is just a pair \u2013 Norway and Sweden. This follows the broad pattern of the \nexistence of certain core countries, particularly those towards the extremes, in all types of \nwelfare state classification (Table 1). This means that the results of the defamilisation \nanalysis, whilst perhaps very different in how certain less clear countries are classified or \nindeed on the number of regimes suggested, share certain core characteristics with the rest of \nthe welfare state classification literature. \n \nOverall then, this suggests that some countries are more homogeneous across different policy \nareas and are therefore always found in the same welfare state regime regardless of which \nparticular area is being examined: the USA, Germany and The Netherlands, and Denmark, \nNorway and Sweden emerge as the overall most distinctive and thereby core countries in all \nwelfare state modelling. The other countries are more heterogeneous in their policy profile \nand are therefore much more vulnerable to exhibiting fluctuating regime membership \ndepending on which policy is under examination (Author reference, 2005b). These variations \nacross different policy areas have led to the questioning of the entire concept of welfare state \nregimes and the possibility of accurate welfare state typologies (Kasza, 2002). However, \ncertain core countries, which are found to be distinctive regardless of what particular variables \nor policy provision is under examination, are the \u2018ideal type\u2019 regimes around which the others \ncluster and their proximity to one or another may vary across different policy areas. Clearly, \nmore work on countries, such as Japan or Italy which are more difficult to classify, is \n 17 \nrequired, and the fluid nature of classification needs to be recognised; the welfare state \nregimes concept does not therefore need to be abandoned but requires an acknowledgement \nthat some countries are more easily classified than others. Defamilisation, or other concepts \nthat reflect gender stratification, may therefore be useful in future welfare state modelling by \nfacilitating a more common classification of these disputed cases.  \n \nIn the previous analyses of defamilisation, the similarities between the defamilisation regimes \nand more mainstream typologies led to the authors concluding that separate gendered or \ndefamilisation analysis was not necessary (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Bambra, 2004). In the \ncases of Esping-Andersen (1999) and Bambra (2004), the similarities were due largely to the \nmethod of analysis (Bambra, 2006), and for Korpi (2000) and Esping-Andersen (1999) the \nflawed conceptualisations of defamilisation may also have been influential. In contrast, the \nmore methodologically robust cluster analysis in this article, whilst lending some support to \nthe idea of core regime countries, has highlighted significant differences between mainstream \nand defamilisation-based analysis. However, whether these differences are sufficient enough \nto support a move towards separate gender-based welfare state classifications is a more \ndifficult issue. Conducting separate gender analysis removes it from the mainstream and, as \nhas been largely the case to date, it is therefore treated as an appendix to the main debate and \nanalysis. The results of this article, especially in terms of highlighting the different welfare \nstate arrangements that emerge when a concept such as defamilisation is used, suggests above \nall that analysis which acknowledges that gender is a form of social stratification within \nwelfare states and welfare state regimes should be overtly, not implicitly or absentmindedly, \nundertaken as part of mainstream analysis. Combining gender stratification concepts, such as \ndefamilisation, with others like the decommodification of labour (Esping-Andersen, 1990) or \nwelfare services (Bambra, 2005a; 2005b), in a sound methodological manner is the only way \n 18 \nin which to build a truly holistic classification of welfare states and one in which there are \npotentially less disputed cases.  \n \nConclusion \nThis cluster analysis of defamilisation has produced a five-fold welfare state typology. This is \nin stark contrast to the three-fold typologies proposed by previous analyses of defamilisation \n(Esping-Andersen, 1999; Korpi, 2000; Bambra, 2004). However, in common with the \nmainstream literature and previous defamilisation research, certain countries have emerged as \ncore components of welfare state regimes. Most notably, the defamilisation analysis has \nhighlighted the centrality of the USA, Germany and The Netherlands, and Norway and \nSweden, as the foundation blocks of three regimes and, at least in terms of defamilisation, the \nUK and Japan for two more regimes. Much of this is in common with the main thrust of \nbroader comparative welfare state analysis; however, certain clear differences have been \nhighlighted and these suggest that defamilisation, or other concepts that are capable of \nencapsulating gender as one of the stratifications within welfare states and welfare state \nregimes, would be a useful conceptual addition to analyses of income protection and social \nexpenditure (Bonoli, 1997; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Esping-Andersen, 1990; Ferrera, 1996; \nKorpi & Palme, 1998; Leibfreid, 1992; Pitruzzello, 1999) or welfare service provision \n(Bambra, 2005ab). The usefulness of the concept of defamilisation has therefore been \nhighlighted and rejuvenated by the use of a more robust method of analysis. Cluster analysis, \nand other more objective means of analysing welfare state differences and similarities, should \nbe more apparent within future attempts at welfare state modelling. Previous attempts at \nwelfare state classification, especially in terms of defamilisation (Esping-Andersen, 1999; \nBambra, 2006), have been undermined by the limited methods used (Bambra, 2006) and the \nprominent reliance upon eyeballing the data (Gough, 2001) and fitting it to a priori \n 19 \nassumptions (Bambra, 2006). Above all, then, this article has demonstrated the benefits of \nutilising a more methodologically robust approach to welfare state modelling. Future attempts \nat classification should therefore build upon this approach and develop a more holistic means \nof comparing welfare states, one which overtly acknowledges the role of gender stratification, \nand does so in a methodologically mature way. \n \nLimitations \nThe analysis in this article is subject to a number of limitations. Firstly, defamilisation is \nmeasured using only three of the four original measures, as relative female wage had to be \nexcluded on the grounds of multicollinearity. Furthermore, the conceptualisation of \ndefamilisation in this article, reflecting its original usage (Bambra, 2004), is very centred on \nthe labour market and subsequently it does not examine other more institutional aspects of \nwelfare state provision. If other indicators, or more indicators, had been used the conclusions \nmay have been different. Similarly, as cluster analysis requires quantifiable indicators, more \n\u2018qualitative\u2019 measures that may have been able to encapsulate aspects of institutional \narrangements relevant to defamilisation (such as provision for income splitting within pension \nsystems or pension contributions for time spent providing family care, e.g. Switzerland\u2019s \nErziehungsgutschriften and Betreuungsgutschriften) could not be included in the analysis. \nThe resulting defamilisation based welfare state regimes are therefore unable to reflect such \ninstitutional matters. Subsequently, caution should be applied to the results and their \ninterpretation. Furthermore, as the data used in the analysis related only to the years \n2003\/2004, it is possible that the same analysis may produce different results if repeated for \nother years. Lastly, cluster analysis and other statistical techniques of regime construction \ncould be viewed as overly quantifying to the detriment of the more qualitative and theoretical \naspects of typology construction.  \n 20 \n \n References \nArts W, Gelissen J (2002).
