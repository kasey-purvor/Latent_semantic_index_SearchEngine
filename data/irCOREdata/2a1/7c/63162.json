Introduction \n \nby \nLuigi Cavaleria\u2217\n \nAlong the progressive development of the art of wave modelling we have witnessed periods \nof great advances usually followed by periods of consolidation, when the focus of activity \nwas mainly on the application of the newly developed tools and artifices. Wave modelling is a \ngreat art containing two aspects of human knowledge: theory, often touching basic principles \nfrom more fundamental sciences, and practical applications. Our ever increasing interaction \nwith the sea has offered endless opportunities to apply to the everyday problems what the \ntheory had just revealed. Granted a certain degree of maturity has been reached, advances are \noften rapid at the beginning of a science. With a bit of low pass filtering, we can easily \nrecognise in the last sixty years the periods when more fundamental advances in wave \nmodelling have taken place, followed by periods of application and a proliferation of small \nscale improvements. Unavoidably, the rate with which we advance tends to decrease. The \nbasic pieces of information, at least within the present perspective, have been brought to light, \nand we are much closer to providing satisfactory results on a large scale. Somehow, the wave \nmodelling community is asking to itself if and when new basic pieces of knowledge will \nappear. The alternative would be to carry on with technological and engineeristic \nimprovements, edging our way towards more satisfactory results. \n \nAt this stage we feel the need to understand better where we are, and to get a better \nperspective of the evolution of the problem and of the state of the art of the science we deal \nwith. In this paper we make a picture of the present situation, when necessary with some \nhistorical perspective, and we try to give indications, in some cases hints, of where wave \nmodelling should or it is expected to go in the future. Following a common conceptual model, \nwe have split the discussion into separate subjects. To a good degree of approximation this \ncorresponds to how the problem is presently formulated in its basic equations and physical \n                                                 \n\u2217 Corresponding author, ISMAR-CNR, San Polo 1364, 30125 Venezia, Italy.

About this point a more extensive comment will be given in the final discussion. \nWe consider progressively the following subjects. \nInput by wind is the essential process without which wind waves would not exist. Witnessed \nby man since the early ages, this elusive process has defeated for a long while human \nintuition. The theoretical and practical difficulties cannot be overestimated. \nNonlinear interactions are probably the most solid piece of information in wave modelling. \nInspired by fundamental physics, and brought to light more than forty years ago, it is well \ndefined. The problem is practical, in that the necessary computer time for its proper \nevaluation is not yet available. \nWhite-capping, or dissipation in deep water, is the third basic physical process that governs \nthe evolution of wind waves in the open oceans. It is the least understood part of wave \nevolution, and, combining some intuition with a pragmatic approach, it has been for a while, \nand still is, the tuning knob of any wave model.  \nOnce in shallow water, nonlinear interactions become a more active subject of theoretical \nresearch. This section provides a summary of the recent advances, with substantial \nexpectations for practical applications. \nBottom dissipation represents the interaction and energy sink of wind waves with\/at the sea \nbottom. It summarises a number of different processes. Although bottom friction represents \nthe most commonly used term, the relevance of each process depends on the local \ncharacteristics of the sea floor. \nWave propagation in non-homogeneous media, and in particular wave-current interactions, \nare the first link between these two more evident characteristics of the sea. The related \ninterests and practical improvements have gone in one with the available knowledge of the \ndistribution of currents at the coasts and in the open oceans. \nFinally, numerics represents the practical description and application of the above processes. \nThe discrete description of the sea we use in wave modelling leads to a number of problems \nwhose solution we try to optimise. \nEach of the above subjects may, and often does, represent the focus of activity of the single \nmodeller.  Hence each section has been written by a different group of persons, with their own \nstyle. Although we have applied a minimum of homogenisation, there are obvious differences \nin the way each section is dealt with. In a way, this reflects the multi-dimensional approach to \nthe problem. Granted the constant flow of information to the whole community, each person \nor subgroup contributes autonomously with his\/their own initiative. The joining force of our \ngroup is the common interest in waves and the wish to improve our results with a permanent \nexchange of information. \nIt has been suggested that a more unified and controlled approach would be more effective. \nApart from the obvious financial and institutional difficulties, this could be true in the short \nterm, for a specific problem. With a wider perspective and in the long term, we need the wild \nhorse that comes out with unconventional ideas, one of which may become the seed for \nfurther advancements. As human beings, we are far from being a perfect organisation, but we \nare joined by our common desire to understand the essence and beauty of nature. \nThe paper is organised in the logical sequence outlined above. Sections from 2 to 8 deal \nprogressively with wind input, nonlinear interactions, white-capping, nonlinear interactions in \nshallow water, interactions with the sea bottom, motion in non-homogeneous media and \nwave-current interactions, and numerics. In section 9 we summarise the situation, pointing out \nthe well established results and, more interestingly from the scientific point of view, the \nproblems we are still left with. Finally in section 10 we discuss the challenges and the \nopenings we expect for the future. \nAlthough not up to the level of a paper, each section is self-standing, and it can be easily read \nautonomously. However, a progressive reading of the various sections will made clearer both \nthe difficulties of the overall problem and how far we have been able to go. \nThe paper is authored by the whole Group, as we consider any advancement as a collective \nachievement. The continuous interactions and exchange of information are an essential part of \nour activity. However, each single section has been written by a definite sub-group, whose \ncomponents are listed after each sub-title. Their affiliations are given, all together, at the end \nof the paper \n \n2. Brief Review of Wind-Wave Generation \n \nby \nPeter A.E.M. Janssenb, Luigi Cavaleria, Donald Resioc, Hendrik L. Tolmand\n \nThe problem of the growth of ocean waves by wind and the consequent feedback of the ocean \nwaves on the wind has led to quite some controversy and many debates in the literature. \nNevertheless, the combination of observations from field campaigns in the 1970's and the \ntheoretical work on the critical layer mechanism which started in the 1950's has resulted in \nparameterizations of the wind-input source function that provide good results in operational \nwave models.. Together with a realistic representation of the high-wave number part of the \nwave spectrum, these parameterizations of wind-input have the potential to yield realistic \nestimates of the air-sea momentum transfer. The mutual interaction of ocean waves and the \natmosphere has resulted in improved forecast skill for wind and ocean wave height, in \nparticular in documented cases at ECMWF.  \nIn this section, after reviewing the present state of the art of our knowledge on the wind-input \nsource function and the feedback of ocean waves on the wind, we discuss a number of open \nissues which may need to be addressed in the near future. These concern the problem of high-\nfrequency variability in atmospheric models and the modelling of the extreme cases of large \nwinds and low winds. In particular, it is becoming increasingly clear that the drag coefficient \nmay not be well specified in extreme situations such as hurricanes. \n \n2.1. Linear theory \nUnderstanding the growth of water waves by wind is a very challenging task. On the one \nhand, from the theoretical point of view it should be realized that one deals with a difficult \nproblem because it involves the modelling of a turbulent airflow over a surface that varies in \nspace and time. On the other hand, from an experimental point of view it should be pointed \nout that it is not an easy task to measure growth rates of waves by wind in a direct manner. \nNevertheless, considerable progress has been made over the past forty years. The history of \nthe subject of wind-wave generation started in the beginning of the 20th century when \nJeffreys (1924, 1925) assumed that air flowing over the ocean surface was sheltered by the \nwaves on their lee side. This would give a pressure difference, so that work could be done by \nthe wind. Subsequent laboratory measurements on solid waves showed that the pressure \ndifference was much too small to account for the observed growth rates. As a consequence, \nthe sheltering hypothesis was abandoned, and one's everyday experience of the amplification \nof water waves by wind remained poorly understood. This changed in the mid-1950's, when \nPhillips (1957) and Miles (1957) published their contributions to the theory of wave \ngeneration by wind. Both theories had in common that waves were generated by a resonance \nphenomenon: Phillips considered the resonant forcing of surface waves by turbulent pressure \nfluctuations, while Miles considered the resonant interaction between the wave-induced \npressure fluctuations and the free surface waves. Miles' mechanism looked more promising, \nbecause it implied exponential growth, and it is of the order of the density ratio of air and \nwater.  \nHowever, there was also a considerable confusion and controversy. One of the main reasons \nfor the controversy was that Miles' theory oversimplified the problem by following the quasi-\nlaminar approach. This approach assumes that the airflow is inviscid and that air turbulence \ndoes not play a role except in maintaining the shear flow. Another reason is that Miles \nneglected nonlinear effects such as wave-mean flow interaction, which are expected to be \nimportant at the height where the wind speed matches the phase speed of the surface waves \nwind speed (the so-called critical height). Also, early field experiments, in particular by \nDobson (1971), gave rates of energy transfer from wind to waves that were an order of \nmagnitude larger than predicted by Miles (1957). More recent field experiments (Snyder, \n1974; Snyder et al, 1981; Hasselmann and Bosenberg, 1991) show order of magnitude \nagreement with Miles' theory, although the theory still predicts energy transfer rates that are \nsmaller than the measured values, especially for relatively low-frequency waves with a phase \nspeed that is close to the wind speed at 10 m height.  \nThere have been several attempts to overcome these shortcomings by means of numerical \nmodelling of the turbulent boundary layer flow over a moving water surface. With suitable \nturbulence closure assumptions the interaction of the wave-induced flow with the mean flow \nand the boundary-layer turbulence can then be simulated explicitly. One such approach (see, \nfor example, Gent and Taylor, 1976; Makin and Chalikov, 1979; Riley et al, 1982; Al-Zanaidi \nand Hui, 1984; Jacobs, 1987; Chalikov and Makin, 1991; Chalikov and Belevich, 1993) \nconsiders the direct effects of small scale turbulence on wave growth. Mixing length \nmodelling or turbulent energy closure is then assumed to calculate the turbulent Reynolds \nstresses. The resulting diffusion of momentum is then so large that essentially Miles' critical \nmechanism becomes ineffective. In addition, in adverse winds or when waves are propagating \nfaster than the wind speed these theories give a considerable wave damping, while in Miles' \ntheory damping is absent. There are, however, no convincing field observations of wave \ndamping (Snyder et al (1981) and Hasselmann and Bosenberg (1991)), presumably because \nthe actual damping time scales are quite long.  \nThe above turbulence models rely on the analogy with molecular processes. Van Duin and \nJanssen (1992) pointed out that this approach fails for low-frequency waves. Mixing length \nmodelling assumes that the momentum transport caused by turbulence is the fastest process in \nthe fluid. This is not justified for low-frequency waves which interact with large eddies whose \neddy-turnover time may become larger than the period of the waves. In other words, during a \nwave period there is not sufficient time for the eddies to transport momentum. For these large \neddies (which are identified here with gustiness) another approach is needed. Nikolayeva and \nTsimring (1986) considered the effect of gustiness on wave growth, and a considerable \nenhancement of energy transfer was found, especially for long waves with a phase speed \ncomparable to the wind speed at 10 m height.  \nBelcher and Hunt (1993) have pointed out that mixing length modelling is even inadequate \nfor slowly propagating waves. They argue that far away from the water surface turbulence is \nslow with respect to the waves so that again large eddies do not have sufficient time to \ntransport momentum. This results then in a severe truncation of the mixing length in the so-\ncalled outer layer of the flow. In fact, the greater part of the flow may now be regarded as \napproximately inviscid and the energy transfer from wind to slow waves only occurs in a thin \nlayer above the surface. Note that the main mechanism for wave growth in the Belcher and \nHunt model is the so-called non-separated sheltering: the Reynolds stresses close to the \nsurface cause a thickening of the boundary layer on the leeside of the waves which would \nresult in flow separation when the slope is large enough. This mechanism is akin to Jeffreys' \nsheltering hypothesis, which was originally developed for separated flows over moving waves \nof large slope. The approach of Belcher and Hunt has been further developed by Mastenbroek \n(1996) in the context of a second-order closure model for air turbulence, confirming the ideas \nof rapid distortion.  \nIn short, the developments over the past 40 years may be summarized as follows. Miles' \nquasi-laminar theory was the first model to give a plausible explanation of the growth of \nwaves by wind. Because of the neglect of turbulence on the wave-induced motion the quasi-\nlaminar model has been criticized as being unrealistic, therefore questioning the relevance of \nthe critical layer mechanism for wind-wave growth. First attempts to describe the effects of \nturbulence by means of a mixing length model have been criticized as well, however, mainly \nbecause the eddies in the outer layer in the air are too slow to transfer a significant amount of \nmomentum on the time scale of the wave motion. But, according to rapid distortion models \nsuch as the one of Belcher and Hunt (1993) or Mastenbroek (1996), the critical layer \nmechanism is only relevant for very fast moving ocean waves with a dimensionless phase \nspeed, defined as c\/u*, of the order of 30.  \nRecently there is evidence that even the rapid distortion approach of Belcher and Hunt \noverestimates the effects of eddies on the wave-induced flow. Sullivan et al (2000) studied the \ngrowth of waves by wind in the context of an eddy-resolving numerical model. Although the \nReynolds number was, compared to nature, too small by an order of magnitude, clear \nevidence for the existence of a critical layer was found for a wide range of dimensionless \nphase speeds. As expected from the Miles mechanism, a rapid fall-off of the wave-induced \nstress was seen at the critical height. Furthermore, nowadays, there is even direct evidence of \nthe existence and relevance of the critical layer mechanism from in-situ observations (Hristov \net al, 2003) obtained from FLIP (a FLoating Instrument Platform created by two Scripps \nscientists some 40 years ago). This is quite a challenge because one has to extract a relatively \nsmall wave-coherent signal from a noisy signal. Nevertheless, for the range 16< c\/u*<40, \nHristov et al (2003) did see a pronounced cat's-eye pattern around the critical height where the \nwave-induced stress showed a jump. As shown in Figure 2.1 there is a good agreement \nbetween observed and wave-induced profiles as obtained from the critical layer solution. Note \nthat there is no observational evidence of a critical layer for dimensionless phase speeds less \nthan 16. These conditions can only be observed by means of a wave follower when \nmeasurements are taken close enough to the ocean surface, in between the ocean waves.  \nA reason for the overestimation of the effect of eddies on the wave-induced motion has been \ndiscussed in Janssen (2004).  Following the rapid-distortion ideas of Belcher and Hunt it is \nargued that the large eddies are too slow to transport a significant amount of momentum \nduring one wave period. The outer layer is approximately inviscid and only in a 'thin' layer \nabove the surface mixing length modelling applies [so-called 'inner' layer].  \nAn appropriate wave time scale is TA= 1\/k(U0(z)-c), while Belcher and Hunt take as turbulent \ntime scale: TL=kz\/u*. The thickness zt of inner, turbulent layer then follows from equating the \ntwo time scales, TA=T  and the mixing length is truncated to the value kzL t (truncated mixing \nlength model). \nHowever, momentum transfer by eddies occurs on a time scale that is larger than the eddy-\nturnover time. Indications for this follow from observations of flow over a hill (Walmsley and \nTaylor, 1996), which gives a much thinner layer, and from estimation of the time scale from  \n \n0\n0 U\nzzt\nU\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202=\u2202\n\u2202 \u03c5  ,          (2.1) zku*=\u03c5\n \nkzu\nz\nU \/*0 \u2245\u2202\n\u2202where for a logarithmic profile  (and not  !). zU \/0\n \nThis estimate gives, compared to the Belcher and Hunt approach, the much longer time scale \nTM=kz\/\u03b5(z)u , since \u03b5(z)=u* *\/U (z) is a small parameter. The time scale T0 M gives rise to a \nmuch thinner inner layer. The resulting eddy viscosities are so small that the corresponding \nturbulent momentum transport can be neglected in lowest order. As a consequence, applying \nthe truncated mixing length model with turbulent time scale  TM  one rediscovers in lowest \nsignificant order Miles critical layer result while in next order the turbulent momentum \ntransport will give small corrections to the growth rate of the surface gravity waves. In \nparticular, the long waves will have a weak damping.  \nThe resulting growth rate becomes the sum of Miles' critical layer effect and a (small) \ndamping term caused by the inner layer viscosity:  \n \n2\n* )\/( cus\u03b2\u03c9\n\u03b3 = )log(2)(log42 \u03b1\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\u03c0\u03b2 \u2212=\nk\n ,   ,      (2.2) \n \nwhere  (with \u0413 Euler's constant). The value of \u03b1 follows from higher order \nmatching (Miles, 1993) and this sets the scaling velocity \n281.02\/ == \u0393\u2212e\u03b1\n)045.0()\/( 00 \u03bb\u03b1 =\u2245== zUkzUV . \nThe parameter \u03b2 is plotted as function of the dimensionless phase speed c\/u* in Figure 2.2.  \nThe analytical form for the critical layer term was checked against the numerical solution of \nRayleigh's equation and with the present choice of \u03b1 the agreement is fair for short waves. For \nlong waves the analytical formula, however, seriously underestimates the numerically \nobtained growth rate. The observations compiled by Plant (1982) gives for short waves an \naverage value of \u03b2 of about 30, hence the short wave limit of equation (4.2) is in fair \nagreement with observed values of wave growth.  \n \n2.2. Nonlinear effects \nFor a given wind profile quasi-laminar theory is fairly successful in predicting growth rates \nand wave-induced profiles. It ignores, however, a possible change of wind profile while the \nocean waves are evolving. The momentum transfer from wind to waves may be so large that \nthe associated wave-induced stress becomes a substantial fraction of the turbulent stress \n(Snyder, 1974, Snyder et al, 1981). The velocity profile over sea waves is controlled by both \nturbulent and wave-induced momentum flux. Therefore, deviations from the profile of \nturbulent airflow over a flat plate are to be expected. In addition, the energy transfer from the \nair to the waves may be affected  by the sea state, so that one expects a strong coupling \nbetween the turbulent boundary layer and the surface waves.  \nObservations confirm this expectation. Measurements by, for example, Donelan (1982), \nSmith et al (1992), Drennan et al (1999) and Oost et al (2002) indicate that the drag \ncoefficient depends on the sea state through the wave age. The theory of the interaction of \nwind and waves was elaborated by Fabrikant (1976) and Janssen (1982). The so-called quasi-\nlinear theory of wind-wave generation keeps track of the slow evolution of the sea state and \nits effects on the wind profile. At each particular time the wave growth follows from Miles' \ntheory. It turns out that quasi-linear theory permits an explanation of the observed dependence \nof the airflow on the sea state. The resulting parameterization of the roughness length in terms \nof the wave-induced stress shows a fair agreement with observed roughness (Janssen, 1992). \nIncorporating a wave prediction model in a weather forecasting system, it is possible to \ndetermine every time step how much momentum the air flow is transferring to the ocean \nwaves. Extensive research at ECMWF has shown that the sea-state dependent momentum \ntransfer  has resulted in improved forecast skill for both wind and waves (Janssen, 2004). \nDespite the relative success of quasi-linear theory it still cannot be claimed that the problem \nof wind-wave generation and the feedback of ocean waves on the wind is well-understood. \nFor example, because the short waves are the fastest growing waves, the wave-induced stress \nis to a large extent determined by the spectrum of the high-frequency waves (see, e.g. Janssen, \n1989; Makin et al 1995). There is presently hardly any evidence of the wave age dependence \nof the short wave spectral levels. However, using a wavelet analysis Donelan et al (1999) did \nfind that the wavenumber spectrum of the short waves depends in a sensitive manner on wave \nage: 'young' windsea shows much steeper short waves than 'old' windsea. Nevertheless, the \nphysics behind the wave age dependence of the spectrum is not well-understood presently. \nFour-wave interactions could play an important role in this issue because the negative lobe of \nthe nonlinear transfer transports energy from the wavenumber region above the peak of the \nspectrum towards the longer waves beyond the peak of the spectrum. But this probably will \nnot explain the wave age dependence of the spectral levels of the really short waves. On the \nother hand, it is well-known that the dispersion relation of the short waves is affected by the \norbital motion of the long waves and\/or the Stokes drift. Such a surface drift may have a \nconsiderable impact on the spectral levels of the short waves (see, for example, Janssen, \n2004), giving an alternative explanation of its sea-state dependence.  \nFurthermore, the quasi-linear approach assumes that the short waves are linear, but most \nlikely those waves are fairly steep. Therefore the nonlinear process of airflow separation, \nsimilar to what Jeffreys (1924, 1925) envisaged, may play a role in air-sea momentum \ntransfer. According to Makin and Kudryavtsev (2002) this could provide an alternative \nexplanation of the sea-state dependence of the drag over sea waves. However, this explanation \nrequires that a considerable part of the drag is determined by airflow separation over \ndominant waves, but it is very unlikely that these large waves are breaking frequently. Even \nin the absence of flow separation, there may be  concern about the basic hypothesis of \nlinearity in generation by wind. Miles\u2019 (1957) theory was derived for unidirectional, \nmonochromatic waves. It has been assumed that the wind-wave interactions are sufficiently \nlinear that the wind input  to each spectral component can be considered independently. This \ntopic was investigated by Tsimring (1983) who studied the interaction of two waves and the \nmean air-flow, which is basically the most simple case of a wave group. The resulting wave \ngrowth to one spectral component now depends on the presence of other components. \nNumerically, the effect is small, however,  as it is proportional to the air-sea density ratio time \nthe square of the wave spectrum. \nFinally, what about evidence in the field for the sea state dependence of the drag coefficient? \nIt is customary to try to relate the Charnock parameter to a measure of the stage of \ndevelopment of windsea, e.g. the wave age c_p\/u*, with cp the phase velocity of the peak of \nthe spectrum. Here, the Charnock parameter is estimated from observations of  u* and   the \nwindspeed at 10 metre height, U10, through the Charnock relation and the logarithmic surface \nwind profile. As a consequence, the Charnock parameter depends in an exponential manner \non the drag coefficient at 10 m height, CD(10), and is therefore very sensitive to errors in the \nobservations for friction velocity and windspeed.  In addition, at a particular measurement site \nthe range of phase velocities is usually limited compared to the range of friction velocities and \nas a result, based on observations from one measurement site, an empirically obtained relation \nbetween the Charnock parameter and the wave age may be spurious because it is in essence a \nrelation between Charnock parameter and the friction velocity.  A way to avoid the problem \nof self-correlation is to combine observations from a number of measurement campaigns so \nthat the range of phase speeds becomes larger (Johnson et al., 1998; Lange et al., 2004).  This \napproach was followed by Hwang (2005). In addition,  rather then obtaining a \nparameterization for the Charnock parameter, which is prone to errors in observed friction \nvelocity, Hwang sought a relation between the drag coefficient and the wave age. The usual \nreference height for the drag coefficient is 10 m, but Hwang argued that from the wave \ndynamics point of view (see also Eq.(2.2)) a more meaningful reference height should be \nproportional to the wavelength lambda_p of the peak of the wave spectrum. Using wavelength \nscaling Hwang (2005) found \n \n           CD(\u03bb\/2)=A(cp\/u*)a                                                                                (3) \n \nwith A= 1.220 10-2 and a=-0.704, reflecting the notion that the airflow over young windsea is \nrougher than over old windsea.  As shown in Fig.2.3  the ECMWF version of the WAM \nmodel, the physics of which was developed in the 1980\u2019s, gives, compared to Hwang\u2019s \nparameterization (2.3), a realistic representation of the drag coefficient at half the wave \nlength.  \nTherefore, for windsea it is possible to find a convincing parameterization of the sea state \ndependence of the surface stress. The drag coefficient and dynamic roughness under mixed-\nsea conditions remain difficult to parameterize at this stage. \n \n2.3. Gustiness \nIn the previous sub-sections the relevance of air turbulence has been discussed as related to \nthe physics of interaction between wind and a wavy surface. Once this physics has been \ntranslated into formulas for practical applications in wave modelling, wind is considered \nconstant during each time step and at each grid point of the numerical integration procedure. \nHowever, there is wind variability with a time scale longer than wind generated waves, but \nstill below the synoptic scale resolved by the meteorological models, that may have a \nsubstantial effect on wave growth.  \nIt is common to assume that the energy transfer from wind to waves is a function of the \ndifference between the nominal wind speed U and the phase speed c of the wave component \nof interest. If this dependence would be a linear function then an oscillation of U with respect \nto its mean value Um would have on average no effect. However, as is evident from Figure \n2.2, wave growth depends in a nonlinear manner on U-c, in particular when the phase speed is \nclose to the value of Um. For c>Um there is practically no interaction between the wind and \nthe waves, hence wave growth depends in an almost discontinuous manner on U-c. Consider \nnow a wave with phase speed close to Um, which is the case when wind sea is well-developed. \nFor these long waves a positive fluctuation in wind speed will result in enhanced wave growth \nbut a negative fluctuation will not give rise to reduced growth. The growing waves act as a \nrectifier (Abdalla and Cavaleri, 2002) call it the `diode' effect) and therefore gustiness may \nhave a considerable impact on wave growth. The implications are that, when waves reach a \nmature stage, they keep growing, although at a progressively reduced rate, well above the \nlimit of a fully developed sea obtained in steady wind conditions. How much the gain in wave \nheight, denoted by \u0394Hs\/Hs,  is  depends on the variability \u03c3 of the wind field (percent r.m.s. \ndeviation from Um). With \u03c3 = 10% there is only a small increase of Hs. However, this grows \nrapidly with \u03c3, and in very unstable conditions, with \u03c3= 30%,  \u0394Hs\/Hs may reach values as \nlarge as 0.3.  \nApart from the fluctuation level, the gain in wave height also depends on the correlation time \nscale of the fluctuating wind. If the wind gustiness has a correlation time scale that is shorter \nthan or similar to the integration time step (similar considerations apply in space), the growth \ncurve for wave height will be smooth. However, if the time scale is longer, the growth curve \nwill reflect this variability, giving large oscillations around the mean growth curve. This \nimplies that the significant wave height can achieve values larger than expected even from the \ngusty growth.  \nIn practical applications the diode effect can be taken into account following a procedure \ndescribed by Janssen (2004), who followed Miles (1997). However, the Hs oscillations due to \nthe coherence in wind variability are not deterministic and are presently not considered in \noperational models. The same remark applies to the correlated part of the oscillations of the \nwind speed. This introduces a certain level of randomness in the comparison between \nobserved and modelled Hs values. Together with the common lack of information on the level \nof gustiness in the input wind fields, this complicates the validation of wave prediction \nsystems. While there are good theoretical and practical reasons to believe that  the effect is \nindeed present, a full quantification of its actual relevance is still missing. \n \n2.4. Open issues \nHere, we briefly discuss a number of interesting future developments.  \n \nDamping of low-frequency swells \nFirst, the problem of the interaction of low-frequency swells and the atmosphere. This process \nhappens typically in the Tropics in areas of low wind speed, but it concerns also the extra-\ntropical areas. Swell is an almost permanent feature of the oceans. This is an interesting \nproblem because surface gravity waves may transfer energy and momentum to the \natmosphere. In those circumstances the usual Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is not valid \n(Drennan et al, 1999). There is, however, some uncertainty regarding the damping rates of the \nlow-frequency swells.  \nObservations in the field from Snyder et al (1981) and Hasselmann and Bosenberg (1991) do \nnot support the idea that there is a substantial wave damping for waves propagating faster \nthan the wind. In the lab, however, Donelan (1990) did find evidence for wave damping \naccording to the following empirical formula  \n 1\n)2\/(\n)1\n)2\/(\n( 00 \u2212\u2212=\nc\nU\nc\nUsc \u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\n\u03b3\n\u03b2        (2.4) \n \nwhich parameterizes growth and damping in terms of the wind speed at height \u03bb\/2. Here c\u03b2 \nequals 0.11 for opposing winds, and 0.28 for following winds. However, when applied to \nswell cases in the field the damping is far too large: for 15 seconds waves one finds spatial \ndamping scales of the order of  75 km. These damping scales are so small that swells \ngenerated in the extra-tropical storms would never arrive in the Tropics. In one of the earlier \nversions of  the Wavewatch wave prediction model damping rates comparable to Eq. (2.3) \nwere used and the modelled tropical wave climatology seriously underestimated the observed \nclimatology (Tolman, et al.,2002). Consequently, damping rates were reduced by an order of \nmagnitude. Thus, for wave damping in the field there is no real guidance: spatial damping \nscales are expected to be large, of the order of a few 1000 km. Presumably, laboratory \nexperiments are not representative for what is happening in the field. For example, in the \nlaboratory there may be currents with considerable vertical shear while in the field the vertical \nshear is much less. Note that straightforward mixing length modelling supports the \nformulation of wave growth and damping of equation (2.3) (Al-Zanaidi and Hui, 1984), but \nrapid-distortion arguments suggest that such turbulence models overestimate the effects of \nmomentum transport by the  eddies. As a consequence, there results an overestimate of wave \ndamping. In contrast, equation (2.2) is based on a truncated mixing length model and \nprobably results in a more realistic estimate of wave damping in the field. However, it is \nemphasized that reliable observations of wave damping in the field are to be preferred.  \n \nMomentum transfer for high wind speeds \nAnother important issue is the understanding of air-sea momentum transfer under high wind \nspeed conditions such as occur for typical hurricanes and typhoons. Not surprisingly, not \nmany observations of wave growth and momentum transfer are available. The recent work by \nPowell et al (2003) and Donelan et al (2004) suggests however that in those extreme \ncircumstances the drag decreases with wind speed or saturates. But, the understanding of the \nphysics of such extreme events is only beginning. What is clear, however, is that because of \nthe strong interaction and interplay between momentum, latent, sensible heat fluxes and \nspray, each transport process cannot be considered in isolation. In particular, in hurricanes \nspray production is expected to be an important process which may have some unexpected \nconsequences for the momentum transfer. Following Makin (2005) one may regard spray as \nsuspended particles. In the so-called suspension layer the heaviest particles remain, on \naverage, closer to the surface so that the particle concentration should decrease monotonically \nwith height. Hence, the spray droplets form a very stable boundary layer close to the surface, \nand such a stable layer  may suppress the air turbulence near the ocean surface. In other \nwords, spray production may, in extreme conditions, give rise to a reduction of the drag \ncoefficient for increasing wind speed. Note that Andreas (2004) sketches a somewhat \ndifferent picture of the impact of spray on the airflow. He argues that when spray droplets \nenter the airflow they will be accelerated. As a consequence, spray exerts a stress on the \nairflow which for wind speeds above 30-35 m\/s becomes comparable to the interfacial stress. \nThis would result in a sharp increase of the drag with wind speed. Hence, Andreas (2004) \nproposes that spray has a direct impact on the mean airflow, while Makin (2005) suggests that \nspray, while forming a stable layer, suppresses the turbulent fluctuations thus inhibiting \nmomentum transfer to the surface. Evidently, more research is required to sort out this \ndelicate issue.  \nThere are other possibilities that could explain that for extreme conditions the drag coefficient \nis smaller than expected from a straightforward extrapolation of the familiar linear drag law \n(e.g. Smith, 1980). Donelan et al (2004) have suggested a fluid mechanical explanation: for \nstrong winds flow separation may be present. Thus, the outer airflow, unable to follow the \nwave surface, does not ``see'' the troughs of the waves and skips from breaking crest to \nbreaking crest. Thus in conditions of continuous breaking of the largest waves the \naerodynamic roughness of the surface is limited giving a reduced drag. On the other hand, \nAndreas (2004) has proposed that when spray returns to the water, short waves will be \nextinguished. This will no doubt reduce the drag considerably as the short waves carry most \nof the wave-induced stress. Furthermore, it should be realized that in the most intense part of \na hurricane the wind field is strongly curved, hence the effective fetch for wind-wave \ngeneration is short  and the sea state is extremely young. For extremely young sea states the \ndrag is also reduced quite considerably as explained in Komen et al (1998).  \n \nQuality of modelled wind fields \nDuring the past 10-15 years we have seen a substantial improvement in the quality of the \nsurface wind speed as follows, for example, from the validation of the analysed ECMWF \nsurface wind against Altimeter wind speed observations from ERS-2 (Janssen, 2004).  \nDespite these impressive improvements it should be pointed out that modelled fields lack a \nconsiderable amount of variability in the short scales. This lack of variability is most \nprominent in the upper layers of the model atmosphere, near the tropopause. Observations of \nthe kinetic energy spectrum obtained from aircraft data (Gage and Nastrom, 1985) show that \nin the synoptic scales the spectrum shows a k-3 power-law behaviour (corresponding to a \npotential enstrophy cascade) while in the mesoscales (less than about 600 kilometres) the \nspectrum behaves as k-5\/3, consistent with an energy cascade to even smaller scales (Cho and \nLindborg, 2001). Global atmospheric models typically miss the k-5\/3 power law, presumably \nbecause the interpolation in the (semi-Lagrangian) advection scheme acts as a smoother. Also \nnear the surface there is a considerable lack of variability of modelled wind as follows from a \ncomparison with kinetic energy spectra derived from QuikScat scatterometer winds. Because \nof this lack of variability in modelled surface winds, ECMWF introduced in April 2002 the \naverage effects of gustiness on wave growth. This change had a beneficial impact on the wave \nheight field, in particular its spatial and temporal variability. Note, however, that presently no \ntheory of the atmospheric boundary layer can justify the level of wind variability measured in \nthe field in certain conditions. \n \n3. Modelling Nonlinear Four-wave Interactions in Discrete Spectral Wave Models \n \nby  \nGerbrant van Vleddere, Michel Benoitf, Igor V. Lavrenovg, Miguel Onoratoh, Vladislav \nPolnikovi, Donald Resioc, and Hendrik L. Tolmand \n \nIt is nowadays widely accepted that resonant weakly nonlinear interactions between sets of \nfour waves play an important role in the evolution of the energy spectrum of free surface \ngravity waves propagating at the ocean\u2019s surface. This role became clear as a result of the \nJONSWAP project (1973). It is described and discussed in e.g. Phillips (1981a), Resio and \nPerrie (1991), Young and Van Vledder (1993), Banner and Young (1994) and Resio et al. \n(2001).  \nIn this section we summarize the state-of-the art in the understanding and modelling of non-\nlinear four-wave interactions. Despite considerable progress, many questions remain. These \nare summarized at the end of the section, together with suggestions for further research.  \n \n \n3.1.  Theory \nThe basic equation describing these interactions is the Boltzmann integral proposed by \nHasselmann (1962) and a couple of years later by Zakharov (1968) who derived it in a form \nknown as the kinetic equation. \nHasselmann (1962; 1963a,b) developed the theoretical framework for nonlinear four wave \ninteractions for homogeneous seas with a constant depth. He formulated an integral \nexpression for the computation of these interactions, which is known as the Boltzmann \nintegral for surface gravity waves.  \nHasselmann (1962) found that a set of four waves, called a quadruplet, could exchange energy \nwhen the following resonance conditions are satisfied: \n \n                                                                                             (3.1) 1 2 3k k k k+ = +\nr r r r\n4\n4 1 2 3\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9+ = +                                                                                          (3.2) \n \nik\nr\nin which i\u03c9  is the angular frequency and  the wave number vector (i=1,..,4). The linear \ndispersion relation relates the radian frequency \u03c9 and the wave number k: \n \n                                                                                          (3.3) 2 tanh( )gk kh\u03c9 =\n \nwhich reduces to  in deep water conditions 2 gk\u03c9 =\nHere, g is the gravitational acceleration and h the water depth. The configurations of \ninteracting quadruplets are often described by a so-called figure of eight diagram, as \nillustrated on Figure 3.1 for the deep water case. \nHasselmann (1962, 1963a,b) describes the nonlinear interactions between wave quadruplets in \nterms of their action density , where \u03c9\/)k(E)k(n rr =n  and E the energy density.

The \u03b4-functions in (3.4) ensure that \ncontributions to the integral only occur for quadruplets satisfying the resonance conditions, \nand thus formally reduce this expression to a three-fold integral.  \nIt is worth noting that these resonant interactions basically reflect weak nonlinear \ntransfers in the evolution of the wave spectrum for the case of homogeneous conditions. \nRecent work by Janssen (2003) suggests that quasi- resonant four-wave interactions play a \nmajor role in uni-directional wave field, in relation to the development of modulational \ninstabilities and the occurrence of freak waves. Yet unclear is the role of non-resonant \ninteractions in two-dimensional cases.  \nIn (3.4) the \u03b4-functions also ensure conservation of wave energy, wave action and wave \nmomentum.  \n \nThe coupling coefficient is given by \n \n( ) ( )2 2 1 2 3 41 2 3 4 2\n1 2 3 4\n9 , ,\n, , ,\n4\ng D k k k k\nG k k k k\n\u03c0\n\u03c1 \u03c9\u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9=\nr r r r\nr r r r ,\n)\n                                                        (3.5)  \n \n( 1 2 3 4, , ,D k k k kr r r rIn this expression  is the interaction coefficient, and \u03c1 is the density of water. \nThe deep-water expression for the interaction coefficient was first given by Hasselmann \n(1962). Webb (1978) used an algebraic manipulator to simplify the mathematical structure of \nthis coefficient. However, his expression contained some misprints. Corrected expressions are \ngiven in Dungey and Hui (1979). Herterich and Hasselmann (1980) derived a finite depth \nversion of the interaction coefficient. Zakharov (1999) re-derived the coupling coefficients for \ndeep and finite depth water, and expressed them in a form similar to those of Webb (1978). \nUnfortunately, his paper contains a number of yet unresolved misprints. Gorman (2003) \nprovides a detailed analysis of the finite depth interaction coefficient and he derived \nexpressions for the treatment of discontinuities.  \nA remarkable property of (3.4) is that it possesses exact stationary isotropic analytical \nsolutions of the form of power laws that correspond to a constant flux of energy towards high \nwave numbers and constant flux of wave action to small wave numbers. These solutions have \nbeen found by Zakharov and Filonenko (1966). The constant energy flux solution corresponds \nin the frequency wave spectrum to a power law of the form of \u001f\uf02d\u001f, in agreement with \nexperimental observations starting from Toba (1973). \nIn paper (Lavrenov et al, 2002) a direct numerical simulation of the Hasselmann kinetic \nequation for gravity waves in water surface confirms basic predictions of the weak-turbulent \ntheory. The kinetic equation for surface gravity waves is investigated numerically taking into \naccount an external generating force and dissipation. An efficient numerical algorithm for \nsimulating non-linear energy transfer is used to solve the problem. Three stages of wave \ndevelopment are revealed: unstable wave energy growth within a range of external force \nimpact, fast energy spectrum tail formation in high frequency range and establishment of a \nsteady state spectrum. In both isotropic and non-isotropic cases the spectra are found out to be \nclose to the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum \u03c9-4, in the universal range. Reliable estimations of \nthe Kolmogorov constants are found out as \u03b10 =0.303\u00b10.033 in an isotropic case and as \u03b11 = \n0.239 \u00b10.023 in a non-isotropic case. Formation of this asymptotic spectrum happens \nexplosively. Accurate estimations of the first and second Kolmogorov constants are obtained. \nA good agreement between the Toba experimental data and our results obtained with the help \nof direct numerical simulation is observed. \nIn recent numerical simulations of equation (3.4), Pushkarev et al. (2003) have shown that \nnonlinear interactions generate an \u001f\uf02d\u001f wave spectrum also in anisotropic conditions. \nMoreover, they have also shown the formation of the bimodal angular distribution of energy, \nin agreement with field and laboratory experiments.  \nIt should here be mentioned that many properties of the kinetic equation (for example power \nlaws solutions) are consistent with the fully nonlinear water wave equations. In this context, \nrecently a number of direct numerical simulations of those deterministic equations have been \nperformed in order to study the validity and the limitations of the approximations under the \nkinetic equation (3.4), see Onorato et al. (2002), Dyachenko et al. (2004), Yokoyama (2004).  \n 3.2.  Solution methods \nThe full solution of the Boltzmann integral (3.4) is rather time consuming due to its \ncomplexity, in spite of numerical optimisation efforts such as e.g. Snyder et al. (1993), Lin \nand Perrie (1998). It is therefore not yet applicable in operational wave prediction models. To \novercome this disadvantage of exact methods, Hasselmann et al. (1985) developed the \nDiscrete Interaction Approximation (DIA). They show that the DIA preserves a few but \nimportant characteristics of the full solution, such as the slow downshifting of the peak \nfrequency and shape stabilisation during wave growth. The development of the DIA triggered \nthe development of third generation (3G) wave prediction models, like the WAM model \n(WAMDI, 1988), WAVEWATCH (Tolman, 1991b, 2002c), TOMAWAC (Benoit et al., \n1996), the SWAN model (Booij et al., 1999), and the recently developed CREST model \n(Ardhuin et al., 2001).  \nThe DIA was initially developed for deep water. The WAM Group (WAMDI, 1988) \nintroduced a scaling technique to estimate the nonlinear transfer for an arbitrary water depth. \nThis technique contains a parameterisation of the magnitude scaling derived by Herterich and \nHasselmann (1980). With this technique the finite-depth source term is simply obtained by \nmultiplying the deep-water source term with a constant factor. This factor is a function of the \nrelative water depth  where  is the mean wave number of the wave spectrum: khk\n \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212+= y\n4\n5expy\n6\n51\ny\n5.51)y(R hk\n4\n3y =         with                               (3.6) \n \nThis simple modification has however exhibited a number of shortcomings in shallow water \nconditions. As pointed out by Herterich and Hasselmann this approximation is only applicable \nfor , which is still relatively deep water for most coastal applications. Also, this \napproximation retains a stationary \n1.0pk h \u2265\n4\u03c9\u2212 form independent of depth; whereas observations and \ntheory support the existence of a general form in arbitrary-depth water (Resio et al, \n2001, 2004). Due to these inherent problems, we recommend that methods be developed \nwhich take account of finite water depth effects in a more complete way. For instance Van \nVledder (2001a) presents a shallow-water version of the DIA (referred to as the SDIA). \n5\/ 2k \u2212\n \n3.3.  Properties  \nA summary of the role of non-linear four-wave interactions is given in Young and Van \nVledder (1993). The main features of nonlinear four-wave interactions are illustrated on a \nparticular case in deep water from Benoit (2005). In this example we consider the directional \nwave spectrum corresponding to case 3 of Hasselmann and Hasselmann (1981). This \nspectrum combines a JONSWAP frequency spectrum (with Phillips constant \u001f = 0.01, peak \nfrequency fp = 0.3 Hz, peak enhancement factor \u001f = 3.3) and a (frequency independent) \nangular spreading function of the form cos4(\u001f). The input spectrum is plotted on Figure 3.2.  \nFor this spectrum the non-linear transfer term due to four-wave interaction is evaluated \n\u201cexactly\u201d by the WRT method (see below) and by the standard DIA approximation. The \ncomputed frequency-direction nonlinear terms Qnl4(f,\u001f) are plotted on Figure 3.3. The upper \npanel (exact evaluation with the WRT method) shows the typical signature of four-wave \ninteractions: first, there is a positive lobe below the peak frequency in the main wave \ndirection, which corresponds to an increase of wave energy for these frequencies lower than \nthe peak frequency. Then one can see a large negative lobe for the frequencies above the peak \nstill in the main wave direction. In this region of the spectrum the nonlinear interactions pump \nenergy. Finally there are also positive lobes for frequencies higher than the peak but about 45 \ndegrees off the main direction. \nThe lower panel of Figure 3.3 shows that the DIA computation produces a term with some \nsimilarities in the general shape, but also significant differences. The first (positive) lobe is \nlower and shifted about 40 degrees off the main direction. The second (negative) lobe is much \nhigher than the exact one and it is shifted to higher frequencies. Finally the positive lobes at \u00b1 \n45 degrees off the main direction are present, but at lower frequencies and they are clearly \nhigher than the exact ones. The position and magnitude of the positive lobes result for the \nDIA in a trend to excessively spread the energy over directions, making the spectrum broader \nthan it should be. The frequency nonlinear terms (after integration over wave directions) are \nplotted on Figure 3.4. Again the differences between DIA and exact evaluation (EXACT-NL \nand WRT) are clear, in particular for the negative lobe, which is twice higher than the exact \none and also shifted towards higher frequencies. \n \n3.4.  Development in computational methods \nThe development of the Discrete Interaction Approximation partly resolved the limitations of \nan exact computation. However, as shown on the above example, experience reveals many \ndeficiencies of the DIA, which hamper the further development of third-generation models. \nMore specifically, deficiencies of the DIA are masked by tuning of the other source terms. \nExperience with an exact computational method in 1D and 2D applications shows improved \nprediction of spectral shapes. Thus, we face the dilemma of having a fast but inaccurate DIA \nand an accurate and time-consuming exact method. Therefore a need exists for a \ncomputational method that would be both operationally feasible and accurate enough for \napplication in operational 3G wave models.  \nVarious attempts have been made to develop such methods. Progress has been made at four \nfronts.  \nFirst, extensions to the DIA have been proposed by adding more interacting wave number \nconfigurations. Van Vledder (2001b) describes the general framework for such extensions. \nProposals for multiple DIA\u2019s were made by Van Vledder et al. (2000), Hashimoto and \nKawagushi (2001) and more recently by Tolman (2004). These attempts are promising, but \nnot yet successful in the sense that extensions are generally applicable. The main reason is \nthat each MDIA is developed for a specific set of test spectra.  \nIt is noted that alternative DIA\u2019s have been developed by Abdalla and \u00d6zhan (1993). \nKomatsu (1996) (referred to Hashimoto et al., 2002) developed the SRIAM, which is a \nmultiple DIA based on the exact RIAM method. Polnikov and Farina (2002) proposed a \nversion of the fast DIA, which doubles the speed of calculations without loss of accuracy. \nMoreover, in Polnikov (2003) it was found some other simple configurations which have \nlower errors than the original version of DIA; however, a major remaining problem is that \nthese interactions represent only a small subset (in which 2 of the interacting wave number \nvectors are equal, rather than the more general case of 4 unequal wave number vectors) of the \ntotal interactions contributing to the complete integral.  For this reason, the DIA will continue \nto require tuning for different classes of spectra. \nThe second line of development consists in starting from exact methods and making some \nsimplifications and\/or reductions of the integration space in the evaluation of the Boltzmann \nintegral. Such methods can reduce the workload by a combination of smart integration \ntechniques, coarser interpolation techniques and filtering out unimportant parts of the \nintegration space. These methods differ in the way the delta-functions of the Boltzmann \nintegral have been removed and the final set of equations obtained, and in the treatment of \nsingularities. The following groups of \u2018exact\u2019 methods exist: \n\u2022 EXACT-NL (Hasselmann and Hasselmann, 1981, 1985, Van Vledder and Weber, \n1988, Van Vledder and Holthuijsen, 1993); \n\u2022 Webb (1978) as implemented by Tracy and Resio (1982), Resio and Perrie (1991) and \nVan Vledder (2005), referred to as the WRT method. From this computational method \nLin and Perrie (1998) developed the Reduced Interaction Approximation (RIA); \n\u2022 Masuda (1980) as extended to finite depth by Hashimoto et al. (1998) or adapted by \nPolnikov (1997), the RIAM method by Komatsu and Masuda (1996); \n\u2022 Lavrenov (2001), the algorithm is based on a numerical integration method of high \nprecision. \n \nEach of these approaches solves the Boltzmann integral with some method. Differences exist \nin the transformations applied to the Boltzmann integral to remove the delta-functions, and in \nnumerical integration technique applied to them. At present it is not clear which of these \nmethods produces the best results in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. \nTherefore, an objective inter-comparison between the various methods is needed to confirm \nor reject claims about their performance.  \nThe third approach is based on neural networks. Tolman and Krasnopolsky (2004) present a \nmethod based on a neural network. It appears that the NN approach can result in stable wave \ngrowth in model integrations. However, much development work still needs to be done before \nthis approach is suitable for general model applications (Tolman and Krasnopolsky, 2004).  A \nproblem that arises in this class of approximation is the difficulty in using any set of functions \nto linearly represent nonlinear interactions. The cubic dependence of the interactions on the \nenergy\/action densities typically produces very strong \u201ccross-interactions\u201d among the \ndifferent \u201cbasis\u201d functions. \nThe fourth approach comprises diffusion operators. Examples are those presented by \nZakharov and Pushkarev (1999), Jenkins and Phillips (2001), and Pushkarev et al. (2004). \nThey developed methods based on a diffusion operator. Some properties of this \napproximation were revealed in Polnikov (2002), where he found a reasonable \ncorrespondence of the diffusion approximation to the exact calculations of the integral. \nProperly posed, simulations based on this approach can be shown to conserve all constants of \nmotion over time (Pushkarev et al, 2004) and can preserve the basic 4\u03c9\u2212 characteristic form \nduring evolution. However, this approximation does not provide a very accurate general \napproximation to the total integral and must be specifically tuned to fit each different spectral \nform. Although attractive for its computational simplicity, it is not flexible enough for \napplication in a discrete spectral wave model, since a coefficient of proportionality needs to \nbe determined for the class of spectra under consideration.  \n \n3.5. Inter-comparison of computational methods \nUp till now no objective comparison has been performed to determine the best (in terms of \nperformance and accuracy) method for computing the non-linear four-wave interactions in a \ndiscrete spectral model. Still, a number of attempts have been made to intercompare different \ncomputational methods.  \nLavrenov (2001, 2003) made comparisons between his method and those of Hasselmann, \nPolnikov, Masuda's, and Resio. Lavrenov claims that his method produces accurate results \nwith relatively small computational requirements. A comparative study of different \napproximations for the Boltzmann integral was carried out in a series of papers (Polnikov and \nFarina, 2002; Polnikov, 2003). Using a certain definition of the error measure, it was shown \nthat the DIA approximation is the best one among some other theoretical approximations: the \ndiffusion approximation (Zakharov and Pushkarev, 1999) and the reduced integration \napproximation (Lin and Perrie, 1999). Inter-comparisons of results from some of these \nmethods are presented in, e.g., Benoit (2005) for a few wave spectra in deep water. \nThese claims need further attention and an objective verification under controlled \nexperiments. Most of the comparisons were made for a small set of academic spectra. In the \ncase these spectra are smooth, some numerical integration technique might benefit from this \nsmoothness. Another approach is to implement these computational methods into a wave \nmodel and to perform fetch-limited or duration limited growth experiment. The resulting \nspectra will vary and will often be different from theoretical spectra (cf. JONSWAP). In \naddition, an objective comparison is often hampered by differences in compilers and \ncomputer hardware.  \n \n3.6.  Questions and actions \nConcerning four-wave interactions in surface gravity waves the following questions arise: \n1. In what stage of sea-state history (wave-sea growth, propagation of swell, etc..) are \nfour wave interactions most important for modelling the evolution of wave spectrum ? \n2. Are quasi-resonant interactions important in 1D and 2D cases, in deep water? \n3. What is the range of validity of the Boltzmann integral derived by Hasselmann ? \n4. Is there any verification possible of the Boltzmann integral (numerical of field data) ? \n5. Do all numerical exact methods for evaluating the Boltzmann integral converge to the \nsame result? \n6. Which of these method produces the best results in terms of accuracy and \ncomputational requirements? \n7. Do the various expressions proposed for the coupling coefficient yield the same \nresults? What are the effects on the singularities of this coupling coefficient on the \nBoltzmann integral? \n8. Compare the relative importance of nonlinear interactions in deep and shallow water \nin wave spectrum evolution. \n9. What is the best way to obtain an attractive approximation of the Boltzmann integral \n(extending DIA, reducing exact methods, neural networks, diffusion operator) ? \n10. What is the role of nonlinear interactions in establishing the characteristic observed \nangular behaviour in wave spectra? \n11. What is the role of nonlinear interactions in modifying swell spectra over very long \npropagation distances? \n12. What is the role of nonlinear interactions in providing a decay mechanism (via \nincreased fluxes to high-frequency breaking) in wave spectra approaching the coast? \n13. What is the role of nonlinear interactions in slanting fetch experiments? (cf. \nPettersson, 2004, and Bottema and Van Vledder, 2005)  \nThe above questions require some specific actions to be taken: \n1. Determine the range of validity of the Boltzmann integral. \n2. Investigate the role of quasi- resonant interactions in 2D-situations. \n3. Collect evidence for the role of nonlinear four-wave interactions (spectral shape, wave \ndevelopment, statistical properties of sea surface, etc.), e.g. by incorporating exact \nmethods in model studies. \n4. Examine shallow-water effects on the nonlinear four wave interactions and the role of \nthese interactions in spectral evolution in coastal areas, \n5. Perform systematic inter-comparison of (quasi-)exact methods as well as \napproximations. Develop work plan for such an inter-comparison. \n6. Design and perform laboratory studies of spectral evolution to validate both quasi-\nresonant and kinetic equation forms of nonlinear interactions. \n7. Further development of fast and accurate computational methods for the evaluation of \nthe Boltzmann integral in discrete spectral wave models, and eventually update the \nparameterisations of other source and sink (wind input, whitecapping, etc.) terms in \nthe wave spectrum evolution equation to accommodate this change. \n \n4 - Spectral Dissipation in Deep Water \n \nby \nAlexander Babaninj, Ian Youngk, Fabrice Ardhuinl, Mark Donelanm, Paul Hwangn, Vladislav Polnikovi, \nMichael Bannero and Jos\u00e9-Henrique Alvesp\n \nSpectral wave energy dissipation represents the least understood part of the physics relevant \nto wave modelling. There is a general consensus that the major part of this dissipation is \nsupported by the wave breaking, but physics of this breaking process, particularly for the \nspectral waves, is poorly understood. How much energy is lost due to white-capping and \nwhere in the spectrum? What causes waves to break and what causes them to stop breaking? \nWhat does the breaking severity depends on? Recent field observations (Banner et al., 2000; \nBabanin et al., 2001; Banner et al., 2002) have found a threshold-like behaviour of breaking \nprobabilities across the spectrum in terms of spectral steepness parameters, but these results \nare still to find their way into operational formulations that, today, are often just tuning knobs \neven in the simplest case of pure wind sea.  \nDissipation due to interaction of waves with turbulence is arguably the second most important \nwave energy sink, certainly most persistent. Whether this is a background turbulence or \nturbulence generated by wave breaking, it is ,another source of dissipation that can account \nfor an appreciable fraction of the wave energy loss (Drennan et al., 1997; Ardhuin and \nJenkins, 2005, among others). This sink term, however, is still to find a consistent way of \nparameterisation in wave models. \nMany more other possible energy sink mechanisms can be formulated for the spectral wind-\nwave environment. For example, short wave modulation by long waves may also contribute \nto the dissipation of swell propagating against the wind, by a combination of Longuet-Higgins \nmaser mechanism and Hasselmann's theory for the exchange of potential energy between \nshort and long waves. All these theories need a modern re-evaluation (e.g. Garrett and Smith, \n1976; Ardhuin and Jenkins, 2005).. \nAlso, our general description of dissipation completely ignores the interaction of waves with \nthe vertical structure of the upper layers of the ocean. One step back on the mechanics of \nwave motion is probably necessary. Indeed, many mechanisms can be proposed for wave \ndissipation at this level. These include, for example, interaction with internal waves, which \ncan be significant when the orbital motion due to waves is felt well below the thermocline. \nThis leads to an increased mixing of the upper layers. In turn, the latter leads to the \nattenuation of swell and to consequences presently not considered in wave models, but a \nsound theoretical basis is available (e.g. Kudryavtsev, 1994).  \nWhile a loss for the wave system, whitecapping is a source of momentum and turbulent \nkinetic energy for the ocean currents or longer waves. Presently this two-step transfer is not \nconsidered, and modelled currents are driven directly by the atmospheric stresses. A properly \ndefined body-force representing the momentum flux of waves to the mean flow combined \nwith a surface flux of turbulent kinetic energy apparently leads to reasonable profiles of \nEulerian currents, TKE dissipation, and eddy viscosity (e.g. Terray et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., \n2004). \nTheoretical and experimental knowledge of the spectral wave dissipation is so insufficient \nthat, to fill the gap, spectral models have been used to guess the spectral dissipation function \nas a residual term of tuning the balance of better known source functions to fit known wave \nspectrum features. In this section, studies of the physics of the dissipation and the numerical \nsimulations of the spectral dissipation are separated into different subsections. The two \napproaches target the same objective but should not be confused, as the simulations cannot \nprove or disprove the physics, and in fact may even disregard the physics and still be \nsuccessful. Physics, on the other hand, is the ultimate truth. Discovered physical mechanisms \ncertainly exist, but their relative importance with respect to the real waves and therefore their \nrelevance for the models is often not clear. \n \n4.1.  Theoretical and experimental research of physics of the spectral dissipation \nPhysics of the spectral dissipation is an elusive subject, and theoretical and even experimental \nresults in this area are few and often contradictory. Three dissipation sources are considered in \nthis section: those due to wave breaking, wave-turbulence interaction and wave-wave \nmodulation. \n \nSpectral dissipation due to wave breaking \nTheories of breaking dissipation, having started with the work of Longuet-Higgins (1969a), \nunderwent some two decades of relatively extensive attention, but have enjoyed very little \ndevelopment in the past 10-15 years. This section is mainly dedicated to recent progresses in \nthe field of wave dynamics, but a brief review of those older analytical theories of the spectral \ndissipation is necessary to understand where we currently stand. The review provided here \nuses extensively reviews of Donelan and Yuan (1994) and Young and Babanin (2006), but \nalso accommodates most recent advances in the field. \nIt is generally assumed that  is a function of the wave spectrum E:  dsS\nn\nds ES ~  (4.1) \nbut there is no agreement on whether the spectral dissipation  is linear in terms of the \nspectrum E or not, i.e. whether n=1 or n>1. Donelan and Yuan (1994) classified theoretical \nmodels of the spectral dissipation into three types: whitecap models, quasi-saturated models \nand probability models. We would add a turbulent model class to this classification (Polnikov \n1993). None of these models, however, deals with the physics of wave breaking which \ngoverns the wave energy loss. This physics, to a major extent, is unknown, although relating \nwave breaking to nonlinear wave group modulations is providing encouraging new insight \n(Banner et al. 2000, Song and Banner 2004). Present analytical models for  try to employ \neither the wave state prior to the breaking or the residual wave and turbulence features after \nthe breaking to derive conclusions on the dissipation due to the breaking. \ndsS\ndsS\nOf the models which consider the waves prior to the breaking, the first analytical type \ndeveloped was a probability model suggested by Longuet-Higgins (1969a) and further \ndeveloped by Yuan et al. (1986) and Hua and Yuan (1992). All of these studies used the \nGaussian distribution of surface elevations to predict the appearance of wave heights \nexceeding the height of the Stokes' limiting wave or its limiting acceleration g\/2 at the crest (g \nis the gravitational acceleration). Such waves were assumed to break until the wave height is \nreduced back to a limiting value, and the difference was attributed to the dissipation. The \nlimiting value used varied from the extreme Stokes value (Longuet-Higgins, 1969a; Yuan et \nal., 1986) to the mean value at a particular frequency derived from the Phillips (1958) \nequilibrium spectrum. The dissipation was found to be a linear function of the wave spectrum. \nMore recently, however, it has been shown that the waves do not necessarily have to reach the \ng\/2 acceleration limit to break (Holthuijsen and Herbers, 1986; Hwang et al., 1989; Liu and \nBabanin, 2004). In addition, once they are breaking they do not stop at the Stokes limiting \nsteepness but may keep losing energy until their steepness is well below the Stokes limit and \neven below the wave mean steepness (Liu and Babanin, 2004). Therefore, even though \nconceptually attractive, the probability models, as they have been derived, are not \nquantitatively plausible. \nThe second type of prior-to-breaking class of models is what Donelan and Yuan (1994) called \nquasi saturated models (Phillips, 1985; Donelan and Pierson, 1987). These models rely on the \nequilibrium range of the wave spectrum, where some sort of saturation exists for the wave \nspectral density. In this region, the wind input, the wave-wave interactions and the dissipation \nare assumed to be in balance. Therefore, at each wave scale (wavenumber), any excessive \nenergy contributed by combined wind input and non-linear interaction fluxes, does not bring \nabout spectral growth but wave breaking and can be interpreted as the spectral dissipation \nlocal in wavenumber space. Phillips (1985) found that such dissipation is cubic in terms of the \nspectral density. \nDonelan and Pierson (1987) added consideration of wave directionality to the energy balance \nof the equilibrium range, arguing that a simple balance between wind input and dissipation is \nnot observed at large angles to the wind. They also separated dispersive (gravity and \ncapillary) waves and non-dispersive (gravity-capillary) waves as the nature of breaking differs \nfor them because of different speeds of propagation relative to wave groups. Donelan and \nPierson (1987) obtained a local-in-wavenumber-space dissipation function, similar to that of \nPhillips (1985) but their exponent n depends on the wave spectrum E and wavenumber k. \nAccording to them, n can vary significantly: n=1-5. It is essential, however, that n~5 in most \nranges of interest - both for gravitational and for capillary waves. \nThis model type has multiple shortcomings. Firstly, the very concept of the quasi-saturated or \nequilibrium interval is now subject to doubt (Donelan, presentation at WISE-10, \nFlorianopolis, Brazil, 2003). Even if it exists, the Phillips saturation level is not constant, but \ndepends on environmental conditions (Babanin and Soloviev, 1998a). And even more \nimportantly, none of the source terms which shape the spectral balance are known explicitly \nand accurately enough to provide a reliable determination of the dissipation as a residual sink \nterm. Also, a dissipation function based on the breaking of short waves in the equilibrium \ninterval does not account for dissipation due to dominant wave breaking, near the spectral \npeak, which may be more severe and can be quite frequent (Babanin et al., 2001; Young and \nBabanin, 2006). Finally, there is growing evidence that dominant waves and the breaking of \ndominant waves affect dissipation at smaller scales (Banner et al., 1989; Meza et al., 2000; \nDonelan, 2001; Young and Babanin, 2006). If that is true, dissipation in the saturation interval \nwill not be a function local in wavenumber space.  \nThe most mathematically well-advanced and most frequently utilised dissipation model is that \ndue to Hasselmann (1974). This is an after-breaking class model as it relies on the distribution \nof well-developed whitecaps situated on the forward faces of breaking waves. According to \nHasselmann (1974), once there is an established random distribution of the whitecaps, it does \nnot matter what caused the waves to break: the whitecaps on the forward slopes exert \ndownward pressure on upward moving water and therefore conduct negative work on the \nwave. This model produces a linear dissipation. \nTwo main assumptions of the model are that the dissipation, even if it is strongly nonlinear \nlocally, is weak in the mean and that the whitecaps and the underlying waves are in geometric \nsimilarity. Both assumptions are not always strictly accurate. For example, Babanin et al. \n(2001) investigated wave fields with over 10% dominant breaking rates, Young and Babanin \n(2006) examined a 60% dominant breaking case. It is not clear whether the weak-in-the-mean \napproach is still applicable in such circumstances, which are apparently a regular feature of \nwind seas. \nThe geometric similarity is also an approximation for real unsteady breakers. The \nwhitecapping commences at some point on the incipient breaking crest and then spreads \nlaterally and longitudinally (Phillips et al., 2001) and may or may not satisfy the similarity \nassumption even in the mean. Therefore, both assumptions need experimental verification. \nWe should also point out that, before the distribution of established whitecaps is formed and \nthey commence the negative work on the wave, some energy is already lost from the wave to \nform the whitecaps, which is not accounted for by such a model. \nPolnikov (1993) suggested another type of an after-breaking model. He argued that, no matter \nwhat the cause of the breaking, the result is turbulence in the water. In his approach the rate of \nwave spectrum dissipation is governed by the effective turbulent viscosity T\u03bd . Therefore, to \ndescribe the wave energy dissipation in a wave spectrum form, it is sufficient to find a link \nbetween the wave spectrum and the water turbulence spectrum. To do this, he wrote the \ndynamic equations, performed an averaging, and introduced a Reynolds stress.  Then, the \nReynolds stress was expanded into a series with respect to wave velocity components and \ntheir spatial derivatives. The Prandtl hypothesis was used to close the turbulent terms in these \nseries. Finally, Polnikov found that the effective viscosity due to turbulence has a form of \nseries with respect to wave spectrum in which the quadratic term should dominate.  Therefore, \nthe dissipation should be quadratic in the spectrum.  \nAgain, the idea is attractive, but the theory needs further development. Polnikov (1993) \nassumes a simplified representation of wave dynamics equations with the efficient stress \nattenuation that is appropriate for monochromatic waves. But spectral waves of different \nscales interact, and the turbulent vortexes of particular scales are not only generated as a result \nof dissipation of counterpart waves, but also as a result of the collapse of larger vortexes \n(Kolmogorov cascade). Besides, we should point out that application of the eddy viscosity to \nthe wave-induced motion in contradiction with accepted approaches in this field (see sub-\nsection on wave-turbulence interactions below).  \nMost importantly, however, generation of the turbulence is not the only outcome of \ndissipation of wave energy. Melville et al. (1992) showed that 30% to 50% of energy lost by \nbreaking waves is expended on entraining bubbles into the water against buoyancy forces. \nThis contribution, relative to the turbulence generation, is not constant across the spectrum. \nFor example, microscale breakers do not cause air entrainment and therefore should expend \nrelatively more energy on generating the turbulence. \nTo summarize this brief overview of existing theories of spectral dissipation, we find several \nstudies which offer four different analytical models. None of the models deals with the \ndynamics of wave breaking, which is responsible for dissipation. Rather, they suggest \nhypotheses to interpret either pre-breaking or post-breaking wave field properties. All of the \nhypotheses lack experimental support or validation. Results vary from the dissipation being a \nlinear function of the wave spectrum to the dissipation being quadratic, cubic or even a \nfunction of the spectrum to the fifth power.  \nExperimental confirmation should be an important element of the development of a theory. \nThere have, however, been few experimental studies of wave dissipation. Thorpe (1993), \nMelville (1994), Terray et al. (1996), Hanson and Phillips (1999), among others, addressed \nthe total dissipation. Experimental investigations of the spectral dissipation are all very recent: \nDonelan (2001), Phillips et al. (2001), Melville and Matusov (2002), Hwang and Wang \n(2004), Babanin and Young (2005), Young and Babanin (2006) have made first attempts to \nobtain spectral dissipation functions on the basis of field measurements. \nPhillips et al. (2001) used high range resolution radar measurements and Melville and \nMatusov (2002) used aerial imaging to study distributions of the length of breaking wave \nfronts \u039b(c) where \u039b(c)dc is the average length of breaking crests per unit area of ocean \nsurface travelling at velocities from c to c+dc (Phillips 1985). They inferred a spectral \nfunction for the dissipation in terms of the phase speed c as the spectral parameter. Phillips et \nal. (2001) obtained it for a single wind speed and Melville and Matusov (2002) included a \nwind dependence of  into the \u039b function: 310U\n3\n10\n5 )10)(()(\nU\ncc\ng\nbcS wds \u039b= \u03c1  (4.2) \nwhere the wind speed  has to be expressed in m\/s. Connection of this dissipation with the \nwave spectrum was not obtained explicitly and therefore it cannot be directly compared with \nother dissipation functions below. \n3\n10U\nDonelan (2001) (as did Phillips (1985) and Donelan and Pierson (1987) in analytical models \ndescribed above) used the balance of source terms to derive . He argued that, for \nstationary fetch-limited no-current conditions,  and  are more than an order of \nmagnitude larger than the advection and the non-linear interaction terms in some parts of the \nwave spectrum. Therefore there are wavenumbers in the wave spectrum  where the \nbalance is totally dominated by the wind input and the dissipation. If spectra of young fetch-\nlimited waves are considered and an appropriate hypothesis about the form of the dissipation \nfunction is used, the spectral dissipation can be obtained from the spectral wind input \nfunction. Using only peak values of his spectra, Donelan (2001) obtained the dissipation as \ndsS\ninS dsS\n)(k\u03a6\n5.35.2 )(~)()()(36 kEkBkEkSds \u03c9=  (4.3) \nwhere  is termed the saturation spectrum (Phillips 1984). Here, the dissipation \nremains local in wavenumber space.  \n)()( 4 kEkkB =\nHowever, once Donelan (2001) applied his function to the measured spectra at wavenumbers \nabove the spectral peak, the  and  balance could not be satisfied. The two energy \nsource functions could only be brought into balance by assuming that the mean square slope s \ninS dsS\nof long waves modifies the dissipation rate at shorter waves. The dissipation function was \nadjusted accordingly: \n5.22 )]())(5001)[(()(36 kBkskEkSds += \u03c9  (4.4) \nThe dissipation (4.4) is not local in wavenumber space, due to the s term, - as the quasi-\nsaturated theories suggested, - but on the contrary, acknowledges the importance of influence \nof longer waves on the dissipation of short waves. \nThe influence, according to Donelan (2001), is due to the fact that dissipation rates for the \nshort quasi-saturated waves are modulated by the straining action of longer waves. On the \nforward faces of longer waves, the short-wave steepness increases causing frequent breaking \nand correspondingly a net reduction in the energy density.  \nThe factor 500, however, may appear too large. A rather large swell of 2 m significant height \nand 10 s period gives a dissipation which is greater by a factor 2.3 compared to the case \nwithout swell. Such a large dissipation would result in a lower wave growth, which does not \nseem consistent with the data (e.g. Dobson et al. 1989), although a detailed hindcast would be \nnecessary.  \nApart from this mechanism for longer waves affecting dissipation at shorter scales, other \nmechanisms have also been suggested by experimentalists. The other mechanisms involve \neffects due to breaking of large waves. Banner et al. (1989) showed that the large scale \nbreaking brings about rapid attenuation of short waves in its wake and therefore may cause \nthe spectral dissipation function to depend on frequency relative to the peak. Meza et al. \n(2000), in a laboratory experiment with forced isolated breakers within transient wave trains, \nshowed that large breakers do not cause energy loss from dominant waves - but almost \nexclusively from wave components well above the spectral peak. An unresolved effect here is \nwhether the loss is predominantly from bound harmonic nonlinearities of the steep dominant \nwaves, or from the shorter free waves. \nHwang and Wang (2004), like Donelan (2001), used the source term balance idea to derive \n. The approach follows closely the discussions of Phillips (1984) who suggested that \nknowledge of the spectrum dependence on wind speed can be used to understand the \nbehaviour of the dissipation function. They applied the source term balance approach to the \nspectra of short waves, twice the peak frequency and above, with wavelengths from 2cm to \n6m, collected in the ocean using a free-drifting measurement technique to mitigate the \nproblems associated with Doppler frequency shift of short-scale waves. A unique feature in \ntheir result is a non-monotonic behaviour of the dissipation function, proportional to \ndsS\n3.2E  for \ncapillary waves, approaching 3E  at the other end of the wavelength scale, and reaching up to \n10E  in the middle wavelength range (0.2m to 1.5m long). They suggest that the quasi-singular \nbehaviour of the dissipation in the middle wavelength range may be an indication that the \nimportant spectral signature of wave breaking has a maximum in the wavenumber domain.  \nWhy would the maximum of spectral restoration occur in the intermediate scale waves with wavelengths \nbetween 0.2 to 1.5 m? The approach is based on the assumption of local spectral balance between the \nwind input and dissipation and, since their spectral wind input is a linear function of the wave spectrum, \nthe sudden rise of the dissipation to being ~ 10E  apparently reflects the sudden rise of the responsiveness \nof wave breaking to the wave spectral density disturbances at the respective scales. This enhanced \nspectral density responsiveness at the middle wave-length range is suggestive that the wind input, which \nis assumed a monotonic function of wavenumber, is not the only mechanism that generates intermediate \nscale waves. Detachment of breaking jet, impulsive impact and the waveform deformation due to wave \nbreaking will produce spectral signature in the intermediate wavelengths. Hwang (2005) argues that the \nexcessive generation at these scales of shorter waves is perhaps brought about by breaking of larger \ndominant waves. Such excessive generation is not accounted for in our present formulation of the action \nor energy density conservation equation. As a result, it is compensated artificially by an excessive \ndissipation function, and subsequently manifests itself via enhanced level of breaking of shorter waves. \nThe correlation between the dominant breaking and the short-scale breaking was observed by means of \nradar and acoustic sensing of the ocean surface (Hwang 2005). Thus, if the balance approach remains \nvalid in such circumstances, it is not only the spectral energy dissipation appears to be a function not \nlocal in wavenumber space, but the spectral energy input as well. In a way, such mechanism is supportive \nof the idea of the cumulative term described above. \nYoung and Babanin (2006), based on Lake George field data, conducted a direct attempt to \nestimate the spectral distribution of the dissipation due to breaking of dominant waves. A \nfield wave record with approximately 50% dominant breaking rate was analysed. Segments of \nthe record, comprising sequences of breaking waves, were used to obtain the \u201cbreaking \nspectrum\u201d, and segments of non-breaking waves to obtain the \u201cnon-breaking spectrum\u201d. The \nclearly visible difference between the two spectra was attributed to the dissipation due to \nbreaking. This assumption was supported by independent measurements of total dissipation of \nkinetic energy in the water column at the measurement location.  \nIt was shown that the dominant breaking causes energy dissipation throughout the entire \nspectrum at scales smaller than the spectral peak waves. The dissipation rate at each \nfrequency appears linear in terms of the wave spectral density at that frequency, less a spectral \nthreshold value, with a correction for the directional spectral width A(f) (Babanin and \nSoloviev 1998b). The spectral dissipation source term can be represented by: \n\u222b \u2212+\u2212\u22c5= ff thrthrds p dqqAqEqEbgfAfEfEXagffS )())()(())()()((()(  (4.5) \nHere, the integral reflects a contribution to the dissipation at each frequency  from waves \nbreaking at frequencies <f< , and \nrf\npf ))())()((( fAfEfEX thr\u2212rf  is a yet unknown function \nthat controls inherent wave breaking at each frequency (perhaps a function of the form \ndescribed by (4.1) with n=1, see Babanin and Young, 2005). The experimental coefficients a \nand b were found to be 0.0065, but these parameters may be also dependent on environmental \nconditions (only a single record was analysed in the paper). \nThus, the only two experimental dissipation function available, which cover the entire spectral \nfrequency band, (4.4) and (4.5) exhibit a common feature: cumulative term that puts \nwhitecapping dissipation at smaller spectral scales in dependence on what happens at larger \nscales. Consistency of this feature has been confirmed by further investigations of the Lake \nGeorge wave breaking data by independent means (Babanin and Young, 2005; Manasseh et \nal., 2006) where the two-phase behaviour of the spectral dissipation has also been obtained.  \nA passive acoustic method of detecting individual bubble-formation events developed by \nManasseh et al. (2006) was found promising for obtaining both the rate of occurrence of \nbreaking events at different wave scales and the severity of wave breaking. A combination of \nthe two should lead to direct estimates of the spectral distribution of wave dissipation.  \nIf the wave energy dissipation at each frequency were due to breaking of waves of that \nfrequency only, it should be a function of the excess of the spectral density above a \ndimensionless threshold spectral level, below which no breaking occurs at this frequency. \nThis was found to be the case around the wave spectral peak. A more complex mechanism \nappears to be driving the whitecapping dissipation at scales smaller than those of the \ndominant waves where enhanced breaking frequency and dissipation rates are observed when \nexpressed in terms of the wave spectrum. This signifies a two-phase behaviour:  being a \nsimple function of the wave spectrum at the spectral peak and having an additional \ncumulative term at all frequencies above the peak. \ndsS\nThe nature of the induced dissipation above the peak can be due to either enhanced induced \nwave breaking or additional turbulent eddy viscosity (see the next sub-section on the wave-\nturbulence interactions) or both. If the latter is true, the dimensionless spectral threshold \nbelow which no dissipation occurs, may not be universal (or at least may not have a simple \nidentifiable functional form) across the spectrum. \nYoung and Babanin (2006) also compared directional spectra of the breaking and non-\nbreaking waves whose difference should be indicative of the directional distribution of the \ndissipation. They showed that directional dissipation rates at oblique angles are higher than \nthe dissipation in the main wave propagation direction and therefore the breaking tends to \nmake the wave directional spectra narrower. If confirmed, this conclusion may have very \nsignificant implications for the directional shape of : unlike , it would be bimodal with \nrespect to the wind direction, and the main wave direction would be characterized by a local \nminimum of the directional spectrum of dissipation. \ndsS inS\nHence, the experimental evidence indicates that the dissipation function is likely to be not \nlocal in wavenumber space and is rather a functional of the wave spectrum. The experiments \ndo not support any of the suggested theoretical forms for the dissipation as no analytical \ntheories have produced the cumulative dissipation term. There are disagreements between \nexperimental results as well: they offer different conclusions as to the mechanisms by which \ndominant waves affect smaller-scale dissipation. Banner et al. (1989), Meza et al. (2000), \nYoung and Babanin (2006) attribute the effect to breaking waves, whereas, Donelan (2001) \nattributes the effect to non-breaking waves. On the other hand, results of Hwang and Wang \n(2004) indicate that, if the local balance of wind generation and breaking dissipation is true, \nthen the dissipation function exhibits quasi-singular behaviour at the intermediate wave \nscales. \nTo conclude the review, we have to summarize that 1) there is no consensus among analytical \ntheories of the spectral dissipation of wave energy due to wave breaking, even with respect to \nthe basic characteristics of the dissipation function, 2) the theoretical dissipation functions \nstrongly disagree with the experiment, and 3) experimental results, even though exhibit some \ncommon features, are often in serious disagreement with each other. Such a state of \nknowledge of physics of the wave breaking losses does not help modelling the wave \ndissipation which has been drifting in its own way (see section 4.2 below). \nThe review of studies of the dissipation term, however, would be incomplete without \nmentioning an alternative approach to the description of evolution of wave spectrum which \ndoes not require detailed knowledge and, in fact, existence of the spectral dissipation \n(Zakharov, 1966; Zakharov and Filonenko, 1967; Zakharov, 1968; Zakharov and Smilga, \n1981; Zakharov and Zaslavskii, 1982ab; Zakharov and Zaslavskii, 1983ab; Kitaigorodskii, \n1983; Zakharov, 2002; Zakharov, 2004). In their theory of weak turbulence, Vladimir \nZakharov and his colleagues obtain a Kolmogorov spectrum of  as an exact \nsolution of the kinetic equation for gravity waves in the equilibrium interval. This spectrum \nagrees with many experimental observations (Toba 1972, Kahma 1981, Leykin and \nRozenberg 1984, Donelan et al. 1985, Hwang et al 2000, among others). In addition, \nZakharov (2002) was able to reproduce known growth curves of wave integral properties as \nanalytical solutions on the basis of the theory of weak turbulence. This theory relies on the \nassumption that the whitecap dissipation can be neglected in the frequency range of the \nspectral peak and the universal region at wavenumbers above the peak. This theoretical \nassumption, however, is not obvious again, as the dominant waves are known to break, \nsometimes quite frequently (Babanin et al., 2001; Young and Babanin, 2006) and there are \nexperimental evidences regarding the significant effect that dominant breaking has on wave \nspectral peak dissipation (Donelan, 2001; Young and Babanin, 2006; Babanin and Young, \n2005). \n4~)( \u2212\u03c9\u03c9E\nWave-turbulence interactions \nIt was recognised very early that viscosity had a negligible effect on waves of periods of \nabout 10s and longer (Lamb, 1932), so that, once generated, swells were supposed to dissipate \nslowly due to the action of the wind, as represented by Jeffrey\u2019s (1925) sheltering theory \n(Sverdrup and Munk, 1947). These ideas have been gradually abandoned and traded for eddy \nviscosity analogies (Bowden, 1950; Groen and Dorrestein, 1950) that are used today in some \noperational wave forecasting models (e.g. Tolman and Chalikov, 1996). Yet there is no \nevidence that wave-induced velocity profiles are unstable and may become turbulent, except \nfor the surface viscous layer (a few millimeters thick) and the wave bottom boundary layer. \nTherefore, except in these boundary layers, the local turbulent motions are possibly not \nrelated to the wave velocity field and no theory can justify the use of eddy viscosities.  \nInstead, the stretching of turbulent eddies by the wave motion may lead to a different effect, \nand we should consider also the possible scattering of waves by turbulence. In order to \nrepresent the stretching, rapid-distortion theory was applied on the water-side of the surface \nby Teixeira and Belcher (2002). The theory assumes that the eddy turn-over time is less than \nthe wave period, or, said differently, that the strain rate of the turbulence by the wave motion \nis more than that of the turbulence by itself, and that the turbulent velocity is much less than \nthe wave-induced velocity. For the wave components that satisfy these conditions, the theory \nyields the following rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy \nz\nUwuP sws \u2202\n\u2202\u22c5= \u03b1\u03b1 ''                     (4.6) \nwhere the Cartesian components of the fluctuating turbulent velocity are u\u03b1' (\u03b1=1,2)  and w' \nin the water, and the (horizontal) components of the Stokes drift are Us\u03b1. This expression may \nbe considered obvious when compared to the usual production of TKE due to the mean \ncurrent shear, but it must be kept in mind that the Stokes drift is not a mean current, and has \nrather funny properties. Among these the Stokes drift is rotational although it is the residual of \nan exactly irrotational motions. \n \nEq.

Considering that a large part of the momentum \nflux may be carried by long-lived and stable Langmuir rolls, the weak modulation of the \nturbulent flux by the waves is a likely hypothesis. However, turbulence is also to be likely \nstrongest at the peak of wave groups where the Stokes drift is largest. Thus the wave \ndissipation can easily be larger than that given by (4.9). Employing the latest results on wave \nbreaking relations with wave groups could lead to a better estimate of this effect. It should \nalso be noted that this process is capable of producing turbulence at larger depth compared to \nthat produced by whitecaps. This may resolve some problems faced by models of the ocean \nmixed layer that fail to predict mixed layer depth deep enough in cases of positive or zero \nbuoyant fluxes, such as in the Southern Ocean summer.  \nWave-wave modulations \nPhillips (1963) noted that short wave breaking in the presence of long wave modulation was \ntaking some energy from the long waves through the modulation.  These ideas were revisited \nby Longuet-Higgins (1969b) who proposed a \u201cmaser mechanism\u201d with the short wave \nbreaking modulation feeding the growth of the long waves. However, Hasselmann (1971) \nshowed how the maser mechanism is largely cancelled by the variation of the short wave \npotential energy, and found that only the much weaker dissipation remained as proposed by \nPhillips (1963). When evaluated with reasonable modulation transfer functions, that \ndissipation is typically slightly larger than the viscous dissipation (Ardhuin and Jenkins \n2005). Yet, Hasselmann (1971) neglected the modulations of the wind stress that can be \nsignificant (Garrett and Smith 1976). One may thus follow Hasselmann\u2019s (1971) and Garrett \nand Smith\u2019s (1976) derivations and realize that this wind stress modulation, working against \nthe wave orbital velocity, should be added to the long wave energy rate of change,  \n\u03b1\u03b1 uTS\na\ninm\n~=\n                                                                              (4.10) \nThis effect dissipates the long waves that propagate against the wind, but may amplify the \nlong waves that propagate with the wind. In all cases, the exchange of energy and momentum \ntakes place between the wind and the long waves through the short waves, and not between \nthe waves and the ocean circulation and the turbulence as in the previous cases. The wind \nstress modulation was estimated by Kudryavtsev and Makin (2004) and Ardhuin and Jenkins \n(2006) by means of using the rapid distortion theory in the air. This suggests that the swell \ndissipation is mostly due to this effect and that dissipation occurs for all directions of waves \nrelative to the wind, with stronger dissipation for opposing winds. A re-estimation of the \nmixing length parameterization related to the \u201cinner layer depth\u201d (see Janssen 2004), changes \nslightly the magnitude of the results. However, Kudryavtsev and Makin (2004) neglected the \nmodulation of the surface roughness which, as envisaged by Garrett and Smith (1976), may \ncontribute to the growth of the waves in the wind direction. A qualitative estimation of that \neffect by Ardhuin and Jenkins (2006), based on the modulation transfer functions of Hara et \nal. (2003) suggests that the roughness modulation should have a weaker effect than the stress \nmodulation. Direct measurements of wind stress modulations is probably a serious challenge, \nbut it should be considered. A better knowledge of the modulation of short wave amplitudes is \nalso needed to improve parameterisations of these effects.  \n \n4.2.  Modelling the spectral dissipation function \n \nUnderstanding the physics of wave dissipation from a spectral perspective has been so \nincomplete that the spectral dissipation rate, unlike the wind input and nonlinear transfer, has \nbeen inferred indirectly by modelling the evolution of the wave spectrum rather than by \nparameterizing known physical features of the dissipation directly. Sometimes, such attempts \nhave been based on trying to fit the dissipation term to an existing analytical model (Komen et \nal., 1984; Polnikov, 1993), but mostly such terms are tuning knobs that may or may not \ninvolve reference to the physics. \nAs an illustration, it is generally recognised that a major part of the wave dissipation is \nproduced by the wave breaking. Nevertheless many recent experimentally-discovered features \nof the breaking-induced dissipation have not yet been incorporated in wave models (see sub-\nsection 4.1 above). Particular physical mechanisms that have been identified by modellers for \ninclusion are breaking threshold behaviour based on local spectral saturation (e.g., Alves and \nBanner, 2003) rather than integral wave steepness (Komen et al., 1984), and additional short \nwave extinction through cumulative nonlinear interaction with longer waves (e.g., Donelan, \npresentation at WISE-12, Miami, USA, 2005), amongst several others.  \nOn another part, there is a growing discussion on what physical features have to be excluded \nfrom being damped in the spectral models as a result of artificially tuned dissipations. For \nexample, Lavrenov (2004) showed that, if the dissipation function is not forced to suppress \nthe low-frequency spectral energy, this may result in return energy fluxes from the waves into \nthe atmospheric boundary layer, up to a quarter of the total wind-to-wave flux in magnitude. \nThis considerable additional source of energy for the atmosphere may prove a significant \nfactor in weather and climate forecasts. Another example: at WISE-12 mentioned above, \nDonelan and Meza in two separate papers presented dissipation functions responsible for the \nspectral peak downshift. Such a feature does not appear in dissipation functions presently in \nuse, but is consistent with laboratory experiments of Tulin and Waseda (1999).  \nHowever, the relative importance of such mechanisms, identified above in sub-section 4.1 for \nreal waves, and therefore their relevance for spectral models, is often not clear. Thus, models \nshould not have to shoulder the immediate blame for not conforming to observational physics \nas soon as the latter is revealed. In any event, progress in modelling the spectral dissipation \nrests heavily on validation methods that differ intrinsically from those which highlight \nprogress in studies of the physics of the dissipation. \nTherefore, in this section we will not concentrate on a detailed analysis of dissipation terms \nincluded in wave research and operational models. Given the recent experimental advances, \nproposed forms for the dissipation rate term are rapidly evolving and are likely to evolve \nfurther in coming years. Instead, we shall analyse the progress of methodology for modelling \nand verification of the dissipation functions and indicate possible future ways for this to \nprogress. In brief, the major historical stages of the methodology of tuning the dissipation \nterm can be summarised as follows: 1) considering the balance of source terms in order to \nobtain the known integral evolution curves (e.g., Komen et al., 1984); 2) validating the \nspectral balance evolution to ensure the known spectrum development behaviour is satisfied \n(e.g., Banner and Young, 1994); 3) uncoupling the dissipation term from the source term \nbalance in an attempt to tune it directly against known wave breaking characteristics (e.g. \nBanner, Kriezi and Morison, presentation at WISE-11, Reading, England, 2004); 4) further \ntuning the stand-alone dissipation function against other dissipation-related properties and \nconstraints (next step); 5) employing exact physics, both experimental and theoretical \n(future). \n \n1) Up to now, progress on dissipation modelling is seen through the growing ability of the \nemployed dissipation terms  to reproduce refined features of spectral wave evolution. As \nmentioned above, the groundwork was set by Komen et al. (1984) who first demonstrated the \npossibility of obtaining and tuning a form of the spectral dissipation function by considering \ndsS\nthe balance of all source terms in the radiative transfer equation. They based their choice of \nthe function form on a rather free interpretation of the Hasselmann\u2019s (1974) analytical model \nfor whitecap dissipation as random pressure pulses, and introduced a set of wave evolution \ntests to verify the dissipation function. Once the proposed dissipation function was \nimplemented in the evolution runs, the model had to reproduce the experimentally well-\nknown evolution of wave integral properties - variance and peak frequency. A list of more \nrecent dissipation functions falling into this category includes, but is not limited to, Tolman \nand Chalikov (1994), Schneggenburger et al. (2000), Makin et al. (2003). Unfortunately, all \nthe tests by Komen et al. (1984) were performed for wind sea growth in the absence of swell, \nwhich was later found to have a very large spurious effect on the parameterizations (Tolman \nand Chalikov, 1996; Booij and Holthuijsen, 2002). This problem is inherent to the definition \nof a mean steepness from the entire spectrum, and leads to overestimations of wind sea \ngrowth in the presence of swell by as much as a factor of 2 (Ardhuin et al., 2006), even with \nthe latest modifications to Komen et al.\u2019s formulation by Bidlot et al.(2005). \n \n2) The next significant step in fine-tuning the dissipation term was achieved by Young and \nBanner (1992) and Banner and Young (1994) who introduced a requirement for the modelled \nevolution, based on the use of a chosen dissipation function, to reproduce an experimentally \nknown form of the wavenumber spectrum tail. Obviously, the spectral models need to be able \nto simulate development of the directional spectrum as well as its integral properties. This \nadditional requirement put the Komen et al. (1984) dissipation term to a serious test and it \nwas concluded that this term can hardly satisfy all the evolution dependences at the same \ntime. Particular difficulties were encountered while attempting to tune this term to reproduce \nexperimentally known directional properties of the wave spectra. Recent dissipation models in \nthis category include Meza et al. (2002), Alves and Banner (2003), Lavrenov (2004), Bidlot et \nal. (2005), Donelan (2005) (the latter two were presentation at WISE-12, Miami, USA). \nAmong other important conclusions of Banner and Young (1994) was a demonstration of \nsensitivity of the evolution results to variations of other than the dissipation source terms. \nFixing the high-frequency spectrum tail to an dependence, as in Komen et al. (1984), \nbrought about essential changes to the non-linear term which then had to be compensated by \nadditional alterations of . This revealed an ambiguity in verification of the dissipation term \non the basis of evolution runs that rely on simultaneous balance of all the sources\/sinks.  \n5\u2212f\ndsS\n \n3) This ambiguity is being overcome by employing a new series of direct tests in recent \nattempts to model the dissipation function (Banner, Kriezi and Morison, presentation at \nWISE-11, Reading, England, 2004). This dissipation function is based on a local spectral \nsaturation breaking threshold, refining the approach of Alves and Banner (2003). Banner and \nhis group proposed that, since the major contributor into the spectral dissipation is the wave \nbreaking, the dissipation function should be verified against its ability to reproduce observed \nspectral distributions of wave breaking, as well as against the evolution dependences for \nspectral and integral properties. The observed spectral distribution of the length of breaking \nwave fronts, \u039b(c), obtained by Melville and Matusov (2002), and more recent results from \nGemmrich (2005) have been used for the verification purposes. This work is still in progress. \n \n4) - 5) In the meantime, it is obvious that even though a major part of the wave dissipation is \ndue to the breaking, there are other mechanisms that contribute to the dissipation (see \nsubsection 4.1 above) and a general set of spectral and integral constraints for the stand-alone \ndissipation function has to include the impact of those mechanisms. For example, in a recent \nexperimental study, Babanin and Young (2005) showed that spectral dissipation rate \nestimates, when compared to the dissipation rate inferred by Melville and Matusov (2002), \nindicate that the turbulent viscosity becomes significant at small wave scales, where the \ncumulative term of the function (4.5) dominates. Therefore, tuning the dissipation function \nagainst distributions of \u039b(c) would require corrections at those short wave scales, as the \nadditional dissipation due to turbulent viscosity does not manifest itself by means of \nwhitecapping. As complex as it might appear in deep water, the physics of wave dissipation in \nshallow water appears to be dominated by yet more new physical features (e.g. Song and \nBanner 2004). Implementation of these and other constraints, proper mathematical \nemployment of experimentally-observed features of dissipation behaviour, as well as exact \nphysics, still belong to the future of spectral dissipation modelling. \n \n5. Nonlinear Interactions in Shallow Water Waves \n \nby  \nMiguel Onoratoh, Thomas H.C. Herbersq, Jacco Groenewegr, Alexandru Sheremets, Jane \nMcKee Smitht, and Tim Janssenu\n \nIn this section we discuss the role of the nonlinear interactions in  shallow water. The section \ncontains the description of the two approaches available for describing waves as they \npropagate towards  the shore. The first approach consists in describing the waves by \ndeterministic equations (simplified models such as for example the Boussinesq equations or \neven the fully nonlinear equations). The second one deals with stochastic models, i.e., models \nthat are derived from the deterministic ones under a closure hypothesis (usually the random \nphase approximation is adopted). Limitations of both approaches are elucidated. Some \ncomments on wave  breaking and dissipation in shallow water are also included. \n \n 5.1.  Nonlinearity in shallow water \nAs waves propagate from deep water into shallow coastal areas, frequency dispersion \ndiminishes and quadratic near-resonances (Bryant, 1973) transform near-symmetrical waves \nto skewed, pitched-forward shapes as observed on beaches at the onset of wave breaking (see \ne.g. Elgar and Guza, 1985), and induce radiation of long waves at the \u2018beat\u2019 frequencies of the \nincident wave field, generally referred to as \u2018surfbeat\u2019 (e.g., Munk, 1949). \nHistorically, shallow-water wave models are based on the classical uniform-depth theories of \nBoussinesq (1871) and Korteweg and de Vries (1895), extended to variable depth by \nPeregrine (1967); these theories assume the Stokes (or Ursell) number O(1) from the outset, \ni.e.: nonlinearity, a\/h, and dispersion, (kh)2, are assumed to be of the same order. Although the \noriginal Boussinesq approximation  accounted only for weak dispersion and nonlinearity, \nlimiting its validity to (very) shallow water, recent advances include full nonlinearity (Wei et \nal. 1995) and high-order dispersion effects (e.g., Madsen et al., 2003), supporting modelling \nof waves in deep-intermediate water and to very high-nonlinearity (see, e.g., Fuhrman et al., \n2004a).  Reviews of developments in Boussinesq theory are found in e.g. Kirby (1997) and \nMadsen and Sch\u00e4ffer (1999); more recent advances include Chen et al. (2000);  Chen et al. \n(2003); Watts et al. (2005); Shi and Kirby (2005), and many others.  \nHasselmann\u2019s theory for resonant quartet interactions, which forms the basis for most deep \nwater wave prediction models, is restricted to deep and intermediate water depths where the \nStokes number << 1 (see Zakharov, 1999). It is well known that the lower order triad-\ninteractions are non-resonant in deep-intermediate depth water, forcing second-order bound \ncomponents that can be important locally but do not contribute to the wave evolution over \nlarge distances. However, as ocean surface waves propagate from deep to shallow water, triad \ninteractions approach resonance and assume a dominant role in the dynamics. This transition \nfrom quartet to triad interactions is the result of the change in the dispersion relation from a \ndispersive deep water regime that does not support resonant triad interactions (Phillips, 1960) \nto a non-dispersive shallow-water regime where all wave components travel with the same \nspeed.  Although triad interactions are exactly resonant only for uni-directional waves in the \nnon-dispersive shallow water limit, near-resonant triad interactions can play a dominant role \nin the evolution of waves in shallow coastal areas.  For example, a periodic wave train with \nfrequency \u001f and wave number k is accompanied by harmonic components (2\u001f\uf02c\uf020\u001fk), (3\u001f \uf02c\uf020\u001fk) \netc. that are bound in deep- intermediate water depths where they do not obey the gravity \nwave dispersion relation, but grow rapidly in shallow water where the mismatch from \nresonance is weak. \nIn general triad interactions transfer energy from the incident wave components to higher- \n(e.g., harmonic) and lower- (e.g., infra-gravity) frequency components (see, e.g., Freilich and \nGuza, 1984; Elgar and Guza, 1985; Agnon et al., 1993; Herbers, et al. 1994; Kaihatu and \nKirby, 1995; Agnon and Sheremet, 1997; Herbers and Burton, 1997; Ruessink, 1998; \nKaihatu, 2001; Sheremet et al., 2003; Janssen et al., 2003, and many others).  These \ninteractions not only broaden the frequency spectrum in shallow water, but also phase-couple \nthe spectral components, causing the characteristic steepening and pitching forward of near-\nbreaking wave crests.  \nShallow water wave propagation models can generally be divided in two major categories \n(see also Agnon and Sheremet, 2000): \ni) Deterministic (phase resolving) models are usually derived from the Euler equation for \npotential flows (Laplace equation + boundary conditions) under the hypothesis of weak \nnonlinearity and in the limit of shallow water, i.e. kh\u001f0. These models, including both the \nphysical domain Boussinesq models and the complex amplitude evolution models (spectral \nmodels),  resolve the phases of the individual waves. \nii) Stochastic (phase-averaged) models are derived from deterministic equations by \napplying a turbulence-like closure hypothesis to the infinite set of coupled equations \ngoverning the evolution of the spectral moments. For any given deterministic wave equation, \nwith a suitable closure hypothesis, a stochastic model can be developed.  Since the closure \napproximation invariably introduces errors, the underlying deterministic model is in principle \nmore accurate than its stochastic counterpart.  \n \nAs waves approach the shore, additional effects such as bottom friction and depth-induced \nwave breaking must be considered.  \n \n5.2.  Deterministic models: time-domain and spectral-domain \nTime-domain Boussinesq models are typically applied to domains with spatial scales of the \norder of 10 wavelengths. Computational demands become prohibitive for larger scale \napplications (see, e.g., Fuhrman et al., 2005). Moreover, in practice, the required phase-\nresolving boundary conditions are often not available and the need for wave field statistics \n(instead of details of a single realization) requires the computation of a multitude of \nrealizations. Given the considerable computational requirements for even a single realization, \nclearly such repeated simulations are extremely time consuming for two-dimensional \napplications on domains of appreciable extent. Despite the recent advances in Boussinesq \nmodelling, including the modelling of highly nonlinear waves (Wei et al., 1995) in fairly deep \nwater (Madsen et al., 2003; Fuhrman et al., 2005) and wide ranging capabilities to model \nrefraction, reflections and  wave-induced currents,  the computational demands for computing \nwave field statistics for random, directionally spread waves seriously limits the use of such \nmodels for operational nearshore wave prediction.  \nAn efficient alternative to time domain models are so-called (complex) amplitude evolution or \nspectral models. This class of models essentially expresses the wave field as a superposition \nof plane waves (Fourier modes), and consists of a set of coupled evolution equations for the \nFourier amplitudes. The application of the Fourier transform results in a dimensional \nreduction of the governing equations at the expense of convolution-type forcing terms to \naccount for nonlinear interactions. Fourier models are  attractive because they provide a \nnatural continuation of the deep-water approach, and  are well suited to handling processes of \nan intrinsic statistical nature such as dissipation and wind input.   \nWhile in deep water the temporal evolution of different wave numbers is usually considered \n(the Fourier Transform from spatial coordinates (x,y) to wave numbers (kx ,ky) is taken), a \ncareful treatment is required for the richer family of finite-depth wave-fields (including \nevanescent, trapped or singular modes, Whitham, 1979), which are also intrinsically \ninhomogeneous. For variable depth problems, due to the fact that in linear theory the waves \npreserve their frequency as they shoal, it is more convenient to work in frequency Fourier \ndomain (rather than the wave number domain) and solve for the amplitude evolution in space \nof waves with different frequencies. Freilich and Guza (1984) developed a frequency domain \nwave shoaling model based on Peregrine\u2019s (1967) extension of Boussinesq\u2019s theory to \nvarying depth. Many such models have been reported in the literature, either based on \nBoussinesq theory  (Freilich and Guza, 1984; Madsen and Sorensen, 1993; Herbers and \nBurton, 1997) or fully dispersive theory (e.g. Agnon et al., 1993; Kaihatu and Kirby, 1995; \nEldeberky and Madsen, 1999); the latter class of models includes full linear dispersion and \nhas no inherent depth restriction in the linear terms, but is derived assuming quadratic \nresonances from the outset. The restriction to quadratic near-resonances is removed by \nBredmose et al. (2002) for unidirectional wave propagation; for directional wave propagation \nover topography a generalized formulation (including off-resonant quadratic components) is \nderived in Bredmose et al. (2005) and Janssen at al. (2005); the latter model includes also \ncubic near-resonances, extending the model validity to intermediate water depths.  \nSimilar to the time-domain models, these models are deterministic and in order to obtain \nwave field statistics, Monte Carlo simulations are required. Since in general, amplitude \nevolution models are numerically efficient when compared to time-domain models, such \nsimulations (although time consuming) are feasible (see also Freilich & Guza, 1984). Monte \nCarlo simulations are typically performed by assuming the wave field Gaussian at the \nseaward boundary. Modal amplitudes are drawn from a Rayleigh distribution with variance \nderived from the observed (or theoretical) density spectrum, and random phases are added \n(see Tucker et al., 1984). \nDeterministic spectral models are particularly well-suited to derive efficient, stochastic \nevolution models (see, e.g., Agnon and Sheremet, 1997; Herbers and Burton, 1997). \n \n5.3.  Stochastic models \nThe shoaling evolution of random waves on a beach can also be predicted with stochastic \nmodels that solve evolution equations for statistically averaged spectral wave properties.  \nSuch equations can be derived by manipulating the deterministic equations and ensemble-\naveraging (e.g., Benney and Saffmann, 1966; Newell and Aucoin, 1971). At the lowest order, \nthe procedure yields an evolution equation for the power spectrum which includes terms \ninvolving the third-order cumulant, the bi-spectrum. An evolution equation for the bi-\nspectrum can be derived at the next order, but this equation depends on the tri-spectrum \n(fourth-order cumulant), and so on. Thus the system never closes, leading to an infinite set of \nequations for the spectral moments. Even though it is well known that the probability density \nfunction of surface gravity waves can be far from Gaussian in shallow water (especially for \nlarge Stokes numbers), a quasi-Gaussian (or quasi-normal) closure is usually introduced.  \nMost of the stochastic shallow water models consist of two, coupled evolution equations, one \nfor the wave spectrum and the other for the bi-spectrum. Such equations were introduced by \nSaffman in 1967, starting from the Korteweg de Vries equation. The same methodology has \nbeen used later for deriving stochastic models from different deterministic equations (e.g., \nAgnon and Sheremet, 1997; Herbers and Burton, 1997; Kofoed-Hansen and Rasmussen, \n1998; Eldeberky and Madsen, 1999).  \nAlthough even the earlier stochastic models (e.g., Agnon and Sheremet, 1997; Herbers and \nBurton, 1997) were derived for directional wave fields, apart from the simulations by Becq et \nal. (1999a) and recent advances by Herbers et al. (2003), most verification has been done for \nuni-directional waves. Comparisons of model predictions of wave spectra evolution to \nobservations generally show good agreement at locations well outside the surf zone and for \nStokes numbers less than 1.5. Higher-order statistics such as wave skewness and asymmetry \nare less well predicted, in particular in the surf zone. It is found that these parameters are \nsensitive to the type of spectral weighting function used in the dissipation source term that \naccounts for depth-induced wave breaking (Chen at al., 1997).   \nStochastic models are efficient in the sense that they compute statistical quantities directly, \nwithout the need of repeated simulation; moreover, they can be initialized at the offshore \nboundary with wave spectra obtained from routine directional wave measurements or regional \nwave model predictions; the bi-spectrum can usually be initialized with standard second-order \ntheory for uniform depth (Herbers and Burton, 1997). However, inherent to the derivation of \nsuch stochastic models is the requirement of some sort of statistical closure. The commonly \nused quasi-Gaussian closure is not suitable for modelling wave evolution over long distances \nthrough regions of strong nonlinearity and dissipation, where it produces an unrealistic \ndivergence from Gaussian statistics, leading to overly strong nonlinear couplings and \npotentially even negative energies (see Orszag, 1970), which is clearly unrealistic. For larger \nStokes numbers and thus at locations close to the surf zone, the fundamental nature of the \nclosure approximation negatively affects the model performance, even to the extent that \npredictions are physically unrealistic. To alleviate this problem and extend the modelling \ncapability of these stochastic models into the surf zone, Herbers et al. (2003) proposed a \nheuristic, dissipation-controlled closure approximation, with a relaxation to Gaussian statistics \non the scale of the surf zone width.  This approach is similar to the relaxation of the quasi-\nGaussian closure used in turbulence models (e.g., Salmon, 1998). Generally good agreement \nbetween observations and model simulations is found, even at locations well within the surf \nzone. \nStarting from a general three-wave interaction equation for water waves, Zaslavskii and \nPolnikov (1998) have derived an evolution equation for the wave action spectrum. The \napproach is basically the same as used in the derivation of the standard kinetic equation in \ndeep water (including the quasi-Gaussian approximation). However, since there are no exact \ntriad resonances, a spread delta function, characterized by a spreading parameter, is retained \nin place of the usual delta function in frequency. The final set of equations is referred to as a \n\u201cquasi-kinetic equation\u201d. In the case of one-dimensional propagation, numerical results have \nbeen compared with experimental data with some success (see Polnikov, 2000 and Piscopia et \nal., 2003 ). Some issues concerning the conservation of energy for the quasi-kinetic equation \nremain to be resolved (see Becq et al., 1999a). In the same context, Onorato et al. (2004) have \nderived a single evolution equation for the evolution of the wave action spectrum including \nquasi-resonant interactions (a spread delta function of the form of sin(\u001f\u001ft)\/(\u001f\u001f \uf029 was derived \nafter analytical integration of the equation for the bi-spectrum), but no comparison with \nexperimental data has been reported. \nEarlier models, derived with the purpose of application in operational wave forecasting \nmodels (e.g. SWAN), include only self-self interactions (e.g., Eldeberky and Battjes, 1995; \nBecq-Girard et al., 1999b). These approximations are numerically efficient but rather crude \nrepresentations of the nonlinear physics. Experiments involving unidirectional wave \npropagation indicate that, although these models can reproduce the generation of higher \nharmonics, they do not reproduce the release of such harmonics for increasing water depth; \nconsequently, they usually result in an overestimation of the energy content at harmonic \nfrequency ranges.  Difference interactions, forcing low-frequency wave motions, are not \naccounted for in these simplified models, which further hamper their successful application in \na realistic setting.  \nIt is a misconception that stochastic models as described here can be applied to numerical \ndomains with much coarser grids than deterministic models. In order to model quadratic \ninteractions, the resonance mismatch needs to be resolved (e.g., Kofoed-Hansen and \nRasmussen, 1998). This implies that grid resolution requirements for these stochastic models \nare generally similar to that of deterministic (spectral) models, and thus more stringent than \nthose of conventional phase-averaged energy transport equations in deep water. \n \n5.4.  Dissipation and wave breaking in shallow water \nAlthough nonlinear energy transfers can be predicted with rigorous theories, wave dissipation \nin the surf zone is not well understood and is modelled heuristically.  Sch\u00e4ffer et al. (1993) \ninclude a turbulent surface roller in a time-domain Boussinesq model that yields a realistic \ndescription of the evolution of wave profiles in the surf zone.  Most models for the breaking \nof random waves are based on the analogy of individual wave crests with turbulent bores \n(Battjes and Janssen, 1978; Thornton and Guza, 1983). Although these bore models yield \nrobust estimates of bulk dissipation rates in the surf zone, the spectral characteristics of the \nenergy losses are not specified, and somewhat arbitrary quasi-linear spectral forms of the \ndissipation function are used in Boussinesq models (Mase and Kirby, 1992; Eldeberky and \nBattjes, 1996).  Boussinesq model predictions of wave frequency spectra in the surf zone \nappear to be insensitive to the precise frequency dependence of the dissipation function, but \npredictions of wave skewness and asymmetry are considerably more accurate if dissipation is \nweighted toward high-frequency components of the spectrum (Chen et al., 1997).  Estimates \nof nonlinear energy transfers in the surf zone based on bispectral analysis of near-bottom \npressure fluctuations confirm the dominant role of triad interactions in the spectral energy \nbalance, transferring energy from the dominant incident wave frequencies to the dissipative \nhigh-frequency tail of the spectrum (Herbers et al., 2000).   \nThe fate of difference three-wave interactions (which are responsible for the generation of low \nfrequency infragravity waves \u2013 frequencies of 0.002 \u2013 0.02 Hz) as the sea-swell propagates \nthrough the surf zone has been studied recently using field data (see, for example, Sheremet et \nal., 2003 and references therein). Observations show that the nonlinear coupling associated \nwith this type of interaction strengthens continuously in the shoaling zone, where three-wave \ninteractions are increasingly active and most of the shape transformation of the waves occurs. \nIn the vicinity of the breaking point, however, the coupling is effectively destroyed, and \ninfragravity waves are released. This process seems to justify the use of \u201cunidirectional\u201d \nhyperbolic spectral models limited to shoreward propagation, as opposed to more complex \nelliptic \u201cbi-directional\u201d models (e.g., Mild Slope Equation).  \n \n5.5.  Open problems \nAlthough great advances have been made in modelling wave propagation in finite-depth, the \ntopic is far from being exhausted. For instance, there is a wide variety of wave-bottom \ninteraction processes that are difficult to fit into a single, complete and effective model. Some \naspects, such as bottom friction processes, are discussed elsewhere (reference  bottom friction \nwhite paper). \nOpen problems related to nonlinear wave evolution in variable depth (in effect wave-wave-\nbottom interactions) are abundant. The following short discussion is confined to a few \noutstanding issues. \nApplications of deterministic (phase-resolving) models to random waves are based on a \nprinciple similar to Monte-Carlo simulations. Waves enter the domain at a deep-end, where \nthe wave field can be assumed to be Gaussian. An estimate of the deep water energy spectrum \nis used to generate random modal amplitudes and phases (see sub-section 5-2) at the domain \nboundary for each realization. It is unknown how many realizations are needed to obtain \nstatistically reliable predictions of shallow water wave properties. In practice, a balance needs \nto be struck between a desirable large number (around 50 realizations typically reported) and \nthe required computer time. \nAlternatively, stochastic simulations are in principle more efficient since these models \ncompute ensemble-averaged quantities directly, without the need for repeated simulations. \nHowever, the quasi-Gaussian statistical closure hypothesis commonly used in these models, \ncan introduce large errors in applications over long distances or through regions of strong \nnonlinearity and dissipation. If the scope of these models is to be extended so that they can be \napplied over considerable distances in shallow water and through the surf zone, improvements \nin the statistical closure are needed (see e.g., Herbers et al., 2003).  \nIt is important to recognize that, successful as the models discussed here have been at \nreproducing observed beach shoaling conditions, they are far from providing a robust general \ntool for wave forecasting in water of finite depth. In fact, most models were developed really \nas nonlinear shoaling models, with the implied domain of application a typical sandy beach. \nMost of the model validation has been conducted on moderate slope beaches (1-5 %) with \nshoaling ranges of the order of 10 characteristic wavelengths and nearly straight and parallel \nisobaths. Many natural coastlines have complex two-dimensional features such as shoals, \nbanks and reefs where the combined effects of the topography and strong nonlinear \ninteractions transform the wave field. The accuracy of existing models in these environments \nis not well understood.  Additionally, many coastal regions contain wide shallow flats where \nnonlinear interactions evolve the wave field over hundreds of wavelengths. These large \ndomains obviously strain the numerical resources needed for deterministic model simulations \nwhile likely invalidating the closure hypotheses used in stochastic models. Another limitation \nof most existing deterministic and stochastic evolution-type models is that they assume \nprogressive waves, accounting for the evolution of incident propagating modes, but omitting \nlocally excited evanescent modes and reflections. Consequently, in their present form, they do \nnot predict the reflection of waves from steep shores and the nonlinear dynamics of the \nassociated standing waves, and the excitation of refractively trapped low-frequency modes \n(e.g., edge waves).  \nTo date, there is no comprehensive model formulation for fully directional wave-wave \ninteractions over two-dimensional bathymetry, applicable to arbitrary scales of propagation \nand suitable for operational wave forecasting problems.  \n \n6. Bottom Dissipation \nby  \nJaak Monbaliuv, Fabrice Ardhuinl and Judith Wolfw \nThe dissipation terms in the wave energy equation are the least well-known. The wave energy \nbalance equation explicitly contains a term for white-capping dissipation in deep water. As \nwaves approach shallower water (depth <\u03bb\/2, kh<3) they start to \u2018feel the bottom\u2019 i.e. there is \na non-negligible wave-induced oscillatory current at the sea-bed and the spectrum adopts a \nnew self-similar shape in which enhanced dissipation is evident, e.g. TMA spectrum (Bouws \net al., 1985).  The wind input, nonlinear transfer and white-capping terms take different forms \nin depth-limited conditions and there is evidence for interaction of waves with the bottom.  \nSeveral bottom-related dissipative processes are known: percolation into a porous bottom, \nmotion of a mobile bed or dissipation through turbulent bed shear stress with an associated \nbottom boundary layer (Weber, p. 156, in Komen et al., 1994)).  Earlier work suggested that \nthe self-similar adjustment of the spectrum might be all that was required to account for, with \nno need for bottom friction (Resio, 1987), but Weber (1988)) showed clearly that this is not \nthe case and dissipation through bottom friction was required to complete the energy balance \nin shallow water.  Most spectral wave models that take into account bottom dissipation as a \nsource term, only model dissipation by bottom friction. Below a short overview is given with \nreference to the most common literature.  \nA process that is also worth mentioning is Bragg scattering from bottom irregularities, e.g. \nsand waves.  However, this is not really a dissipative process but a process that in fact \nredistributes energy. \n6.1.Wave energy dissipation due to bottom friction \nBottom friction is responsible for energy dissipation, which may reach a few Watts per square \nmeter, which is comparable to the energy input by the wind for moderate winds. Following \nMirfenderesk and Young (2003), we can write Sbf(k), the time rate of energy density loss at \nwave number k, as:  \nbkbf ukS 0)( \u03c4\u2212=  \nwhere 0\u03c4  is the bottom shear stress and  is the orbital velocity of the wave component with \nwave number k.  Much work has been devoted to the detailed study of the bottom boundary \nlayer structure, in order to obtain \nbku\n0\u03c4 ,  and other quantities as a function of the wave and \ncurrent velocities away from the boundary, e.g. Grant and Madsen (1979), Christoffersen and \nJonsson (1985), Wiberg (1995), Davies and Villaret (1999), Marin (2004)). These models \nperform well against laboratory measurements, e.g. Jensen et al. (1989), for well-defined \nconditions (smooth and rippled beds with carefully controlled geometries).  \nbku\nCommon formulations for spectral wave models: waves only \nLuo and Monbaliu (1994) summarised the work done on the bottom friction term used in \nspectral wave models (here written in (\u03c3,\u03b8) space, h is the water depth): \n),(\n)2sinh(\n),( \u03b8\u03c3\u03b8\u03c3 F\nkh\nkCS fbf \u2212=   \nThe coefficient Cf depends on the closure model used to solve the momentum equations of the \nbed boundary layer.  Of course, flow conditions and bottom roughness (friction factor fw or \nequivalent roughness K ) are important parameters.   N\nThe following symbols in Table 6.1 are used: friction coefficients c; drag coefficient Cf ; \nfriction factor f ; bottom roughness height K ; kronecker delta \u03b4w N ij; ensemble average \u2329 \u232a; \nbottom velocity components U  and Ui j; U is the magnitude of the bottom velocity vector; \nwave boundary layer friction velocity u*; dimensionless function  and its complex \nconjugate , both dependant on the dimensionless argument \nkTr\n*\nkTr 0\u03c2  expressing the ratio between \nthe roughness length and the wave boundary layer thickness. \nIn the field however a degree of complexity is introduced by the randomness of the wave \nfield, e.g. Zou (2004), but more importantly the bottom is anything but uniform. As a result, a \nlarge part of empiricism must be introduced.  \nSo far also only indirect validations have been performed, based on the recordings of wave \nattenuation between several wave gauges, rather than direct measurements in the wave bottom \nboundary layer. The validation of the coefficients given above is often discouraging. \nHasselmann et al. (1973) found that CJ inferred from the JONSWAP dataset of swell \nattenuations varied over two orders of magnitude, and (Young and Gorman, 1995) did not \nfind a clear \u201cwinner\u201d in their test of several parameterizations for the bottom friction source \nterm. For the analysis of data from a field experiment of wave decay across the Great \nAustralian Bight in order to determine the spectral decay which can be attributed to bottom \nfriction, Young and Gorman (1995) used the spectral wave model WAM as an analysis tool.  \nIt is indeed necessary to take other processes such as atmospheric input, nonlinear \ninteractions, whitecap dissipation, refraction, and shoaling into account since all these source \nterms are also active.  \nCommon formulations for spectral wave models: waves and currents \nThe effect of the interaction between waves and currents on the bottom stress is not \ncompletely solved.  There is still some debate about whether the interaction is weak or strong \n(Kagan et al., 2005).  In the concept of strong interaction both the wave and current bottom \nstress are enhanced due to nonlinear interactions.  The bottom stress under combined waves \nand currents is larger than the sum of wave and current only.  This approach was followed in \nthe formulations of Grant and Madsen (1979) and Christoffersen and Jonsson (1985).   \nIn spite of the importance of these effects on tidal current modelling, there seems to be little \nfield validation of the wave-current theories.  There is evidence that waves affect the bottom \nfriction experienced by the mean flow, e.g., Wolf and Prandle (1999), Keen and Glenn \n(2002), Kagan et al. (2005), but there seems little or no observational nor theoretical evidence \nthat the presence of currents affects wave friction in a substantial way, see e.g. Kagan et al. \n(2005), Weber (1991), Tolman (1992a).  As pointed out by Kagan et al. (2005), it is possible \nthat some effects cancel out. \nBottom roughness models for movable beds \nIrrespective of the formulation used, some characterisation of the bottom roughness is needed.  \nThis is directly evident in the models that require the friction factor fw or equivalent roughness \nKN as an input (see Table 6.1).  In the case of sandy bottoms, bed forms may exist.  These bed \nforms (ripples) are dependent on sand grain size, and on the existing, and the history of, \nprevious hydrodynamic conditions, visible in wave and current ripples and\/or relict ripples.  \nThere are strong evidences for an important role played by the wave-generated bedforms, so \nthat the bottom roughness, at least over sand, appears more important than the details of the \nbottom boundary layer (Ardhuin et al., 2003). In other words an adequate parameterization of \nthe changing bottom roughness is probably more important than a choice between say (see \nMadsen et al, 1988, and Weber, 1991).    \nThere is a considerable amount of literature on friction factors for movable beds.  They all \nrelate hydraulic roughness to a combination of skin friction on individual grains and form \ndrag due to bed forms.  Bed forms here include ripples formed under oscillatory flow \nconditions including sheet flow conditions.  In principle, once sand grain size is known and \nthe hydrodynamic conditions are known, it is then possible to estimate hydraulic roughness of \nthe bed and consequently also the energy dissipation in the wave field.   \nTolman (1994) was probably the first one to investigate the effect of bed forms on bottom \nfriction dissipation in a spectral wave model.  He used a roughness predictor based on the \nsediment grain size and on a characteristic orbital velocity and characteristic orbital amplitude \nobtained as an integrated parameter from the wave spectrum.  Tolman (1995b) even \naccounted for subgrid variability in sediment parameters in large-scale wind wave models.   \nIn practice however roughness values or energy dissipation factors obtained from different \nexperiments differ often by an order of magnitude or even more, see, e.g., Nielsen (1992).  \nThere is the combined effect of waves and current on bed mobility, bed forms and suspended \nsediment concentration (Glenn and Grant, 1987).  Also the dissipation process might differ \ndepending on the bedforms involved.  For example, in the case of large roughness elements or \nsteep ripples in oscillating flow, the momentum transfer in the near-bed layer is dominated by \nthe vortex-shedding process rather than by random turbulence, as pointed out by Nielsen \n(1992) and Sleath (1991).  Detailed process models of the wave boundary layer over ripples \nthat address the vortex shedding that is observed have been developed, e.g. by Malarkey and \nDavies (2004) and by Davies and Thorne (2005).  Possibly these process models may yield \nnew parameterizations for spectral models. \n6.2. Energy dissipation due to wave-bottom interaction \nBottom friction is not the only process of importance for the dissipation of wave energy at the \nwater-bottom interface. Shemdin et al. (1978) gave an overview of the different bottom \ninteraction effects and next to friction dissipation discussed above, two other mechanism were \ndiscussed: \n\u2022 damping due to percolation in a permeable bed layer \n\u2022 absorption of energy in a bottom layer of soft mud \nBoth mechanisms have been worked out theoretically for more or less idealized cases.   \nIn the case of percolation, the dissipation of wave energy is due to the wave induced pressure \nfield at the bottom which in turns induces a flow in the permeable (sand) layer.  The \ntheoretical considerations can be found in Dean and Dalrymple (1984); Shemdin et al. (1978) \nand literature therein referred to.  The wave energy damping rate is proportional to the \npermeability of the sediment layer and only significant for coarser sediments (grain size > 0.5 \nmm).  For practical applications not only grain size, but also the thickness of the permeable \nlayer needs to be known (thickness larger than 0.3 times the wave length can be considered as \ninfinite according to (Shemdin et al., 1978). \nIn the case of a soft muddy bottom, the energy dissipation is theoretically worked out using a \ntwo-layer model.  The top layer is the water column and is treated as an inviscid fluid.  The \nfree surface wave will induce a wave at the mud-water interface which in turn will induce \nflow in the mud (lower) layer.  The flow in the mud layer is damped rapidly by the high \nviscosity in the mud layer.  The dissipation rate of waves propagating over mud bottoms is \nconsiderably higher than over sandy bottoms.  For a more detailed description see, e.g., Dean \nand Dalrymple (1984), Gade (1958), Hsiao and Shemdin (1980), and Cavaleri p.169 in \n(Komen et al., 1994).  Winterwerp et al. (2005) give a formulation for the energy dissipation \nsource term which they used in the SWAN model. \n6.3.Wave scattering and reflection  \nBesides dissipation, the bottom topography may also modify the propagation of waves by \npartial reflection. Over complex topographies this partial reflection is known as scattering. \nReflection generally conserves the wave energy, but not the momentum since there is a mean \nwork done by the bottom on the waves in the form of a correlation of bottom pressure and \nbottom slope. It can be shown that for small bottom amplitudes and in the presence of \ncurrents the reflection also conserves the wave action (Magne and Ardhuin, 2005). This is \nalso a consequence of the existence of a Hamiltonian for waves over variable topography, see, \ne.g., Henyey et al. (1988), Athanassoulis and Belibassakis (1999). The reflection of linear \nwaves is well known for simple bottom profiles (such as a step, a rectangular canyon or a \nramp).  \nA bottom scattering source term can be derived for random topographies of small amplitudes \n(Ardhuin and Herbers, 2002),  \n   \u222b \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212= \u2192\u2192\u2192\u2192\u03c0 \u03b8\u03b8\u03c3 2\n0\n''),(),( dkEkEkkBkhKSbscat\nUsing results by Mei and Hancock (2003), this scattering term was shown to be applicable to \ndeterministic bottom topographies such as an isolated step or a ramp (Magne et al., 2005a), \nprovided that the topography amplitude is small compared to the mean water depth. This \nresult establishes that in this case the Bragg scattering mechanism fully explains the \nreflection: waves reflection only depends on the variance in the bottom elevation at the Bragg \nscale. For natural shelf topographies like the North Carolina Shelf or the southern North Sea, \nthe scattering yields an increase of the directional spread for narrow wave spectra (Ardhuin et \nal., 2003). Bragg resonance was also observed for waves propagating over nearshore bars \n(Elgar et al., 2003). The relevant bottom scales range between one half and four times the \nsurface wave wavelength.  \nFor larger bottom amplitudes higher order scattering can be found (Rey et al., 1996). For \ngeneral topographies of finite amplitudes, several extensions of the mild slope equation have \nbeen presented, e.g. by Athanassoulis and Belibassakis (1999). \nThe scattering of nonlinear waves has been investigated by several authors, e.g. Kirby (1986) \nand Mei and Hancock (2003).  \n6.4. Discussion and outstanding problems \nQualitatively, the process of energy dissipation due to interaction with the bottom seems \nrelatively well understood.  Theories exist for energy dissipation due to friction, percolation \nand water-mud interaction.  Quantitatively however, our understanding is at least incomplete.   \nFirst of all, the location of the sea-bottom is in many cases not fixed in time.  Fortunately, \nwave energy dissipation due to bottom friction is not a strong local process.  The horizontal \nmovement of a sand bank or shoal over a few hundred meter, will not drastically affect the \nwave energy propagating over a shelf or coastal area. \nSecondly, our knowledge of the friction or damping characteristics of the sea bottom is \nlimited.  For example not the whole shelf sea has a sandy bottom.  Quite often there are areas \nwith sand, areas with rock and areas with mud.  Bed forms are changing due to changing \nhydrodynamic conditions.  Changes at subgrid scale are likely both in terms of sediment \ncomposition (grain size, percentage sand, ..) as in terms of bedforms (Tolman, 1995b).  \nBedforms in mixed mud-sand sediments seem to be inhibited, but this is a poorly known \ntopic.  In that respect it is also interesting to quote from p.296-297 of Nielsen (1992): \u201cThus, \nenergy dissipation measurements under waves indicate much greater hydraulic roughness for \nflat, movable beds than other types of experiments.  \u2026..  Is it possible, that the larger \nroughness indicated by the energy dissipation experiments can be explained in terms of the \nenergy dissipation due to percolation under waves, which is not directly related to the \neffective bed shear stress. \u2026\u201d.  Also,  in order to determine the spectral decay which can be \nattributed to bottom friction, Young and Gorman (1995) analysed the data obtained from a \nfield experiment in which seven wave measurement instruments were placed in a linear \ntransect across the Great Australian Bight. The data available did not allow the relative \ncontributions of bottom friction and percolation to be determined.  Or in other words, in some \ncases we are not even sure which dissipation process(es) we need to take into consideration.   \nSimilarly, Wolf (1999) points out that it is difficult to make measurements of turbulent shear \nstresses in combined wave and currents, especially in the field.  Laboratory data may not \ncover the whole range of phenomena, especially so when sediments are involved. \nThe energy absorption of soft muddy bottoms is not so well known.  A standard source term \nfor spectral models is not available.  Undoubtedly, there is an effect of enhanced damping by \ncohesive sediment and vegetation over salt marshes, as has been demonstrated by e.g. M\u00f6ller \nand Spencer (2002).  However, Sheremet and Stone (2003) state that \u201cContrary to the widely \naccepted hypothesis that mud-induced wave dissipation is important only for long waves, \nobservations show significant damping of high-frequency, short waves, which interact weakly \nwith the bottom.\u201d  The two layer concept with an inviscid fluid at the top and a viscous flow \nlayer underneath is probably too simplistic to characterise a more gradual transition in fluid \nproperties over the water column.   \nProbably the only way to make further progress in our understanding of wave dissipation due \nto interaction with a movable or soft bottom, will be through the combined study of the wave \nfield and its effect on sediment motion.  These are closely linked.  But flow properties and \nsediment concentration close to the bottom, and in case of mud also visco-elastic properties of \nthe bottom are difficult to measure. This is so in lab experiments, but even more so in field \nconditions.  \n \n7. Wave Propagation \n \nby \nFabrice Ardhuinl, Hendrik L. Tolmand, Kostas Belibassakisx, Igor V. Lavrenovg\n \nWave propagation is usually represented as the left-hand side term of  the action balance \nequation with many well known effects of refraction, shoaling, diffraction and reflection. \nThese effects typically dominate  the variation of the wave field over narrow continental \nshelves, or the evolution of swells over very long distances in deep water. Large spatial scale \nvariations in the depth and current may cause any of these effects, and the time evolution of \nthe depth and current also lead to modifications in the wave field that may be less familiar to \nthe reader but are generally included in spectral wave models. Although such effects are very \nwell verified by observations for varying depths, there is still little validation of wave \npropagation over varying currents, and the associated steepening and dissipation of the waves \nis still poorly understood. Evolution of depth and currents over scales comparable to the \nwavelength may lead to a very strong partial reflection at any oblique angle that may \nconsiderably broaden the directional wave spectrum. This effect is supported by observations \nfor depth variations, and theories for scattering over currents suggest that it is a very \nimportant process for the directional spectrum of short waves. A verification has yet to be \nperformed. Such scattering may also involve a feedback of the waves on the current, as in the \ncase of internal waves. These latter effects are typically not accounted for in wave models and \nmay explain some of the large biases found in model results in coastal areas. \nIn this section we make an overview of the problem, first considering it from a general point \nof view. Then we analyse in sequence the limitations of geometrical optics and the effects of \nvarying current, both in space and time, with a final look at waves in the real ocean. \n \n7.1.   Dispersion, geometrical optics and the wave action equation \nWave propagation at sea has been a subject of scientific interest for centuries. A \ncomprehensive theory for monochromatic linear and nonlinear wave propagation was \npresented Airy (1845) and Stokes (1847), with non-linear effects specific to shallow water \nstudied by Boussinesq (1871) and reviewed in section 5. A spectral description of wind waves \nwas introduced by Pierson et al. (1955) in order to account for the irregularity of waves at sea. \nIn this description, the random wave field is broken into a spectrum of many regular wave \ncomponents which are distinguished by wavenumber vector k of magnitude k, and relative \nradian frequency \u03c3. Most wave forecasting models in use today consider that the wave \ncomponents are inherently linear so that the wave properties are attributed to either a \ncomponent k=(kx,ky) or the pair (\u03c3,\u03b8) with \u03b8 the direction normal to the wave crests, that is the \ndirection of the vector k. k and \u03c3 are related by the dispersion relation for linear waves. \nTypically, the relative phases of wave components are taken to be random and uniformly \ndistributed so that only the amplitude information of the spectra is retained (dropping phase \ninformation). These amplitudes are then translated to a quadratic wave quantity that may be \neither the spectral density of energy \u03c1w gE(k), momentum Mw(k)= \u03c1w g kE(k)\/\u03c3  or action  \nA(k)=gE(k)\/\u03c3  (see e.g. Andrews and McIntyre 1978), where \u03c1w is the water density, g is the \napparent acceleration of gravity and E(k) is the surface elevation variance spectrum. That \nlatter quantity may be obtained by a Fourier transform of the surface elevation field. These \nspectral densities generally vary in space and time so that the Fourier transform is generally \nimplicitly replaced by a Fourier transform of the surface elevation autocorrelation function, or \na Wigner distribution (Wigner, 1932). It should be noted that the local directional spectrum \nmay have no physical meaning for wave amplitudes that vary slowly in time but rapidly in \nspace.  \nWave forecasting thus reduces to a quantitative determination of the evolution in space and \ntime of the action spectrum taken as A(k)\/g since \u03c1w and g are generally regarded as constants. \nThe evolution equation for A is intrinsically simpler than those for E or Mw because the total \naction conservation is related to the invariance of the physical problem when the wave phases \nare changed, which is generally the case in intermediate and deep water. This relation is \nknown as Noether\u2019s theorem. In the same way, the conservation of total energy or wave \nmomentum is related to invariances by translations of the medium in time or space, \nrespectively, which is generally not the case (e.g., Andrews and McIntyre, 1978). A general \nequation for the total action can be derived for any wave field in terms of the wave-induced \npressure, velocity and displacement fields (Andrews and McIntyre 1978). This includes in \nparticular the Earth rotation or current shears that make the wave motion weakly rotational as \nLaplace\u2019s equation does not hold exactly. An explicit approximation may be given for slowly \nmodulated small amplitude waves (Bretherton and Garrett, 1968) with a corresponding \nequation for the spectral action density (Hayes, 1970; Komen et al., 1994),  \n \ndA(k)\/dt = \u2202A(k)\/\u2202t + \u2207\u22c5[(Cg+UA(k))A(k)] + \u2207k\u22c5[Ck A(k)] = Stot  (7.1) \n \nwhere Cg= k (\u2202\u03c3\/\u2202k)\/k is the intrinsic group velocity, and UA(k) is an advection velocity that \ndepends on the mean current, and also on the amplitudes of all wave components. The \ndivergence operator \u2207\u22c5( ) is the classical divergence restricted to the horizontal directions \nonly, and \u2207k\u22c5( ) is a similar divergence operator in spectral space. The spectral advection \nvelocity Ck represents the turning of the wave crests (refraction) and change in wave length \n(shoaling). Explicit expressions for Ck, or their equivalent for the pair (Ck, C\u03b8), can be \nobtained in terms of the gradients of the water depth and UA(k), using the hypothesis of slow \nmodulation (e.g., Keller, 1958, Mei, 1989). This approximation is also called WKB or \n\u2018geometrical optics\u2019 (GO) approximation, due to its use in the theory of light refraction. Such \nexpressions for (Ck, C\u03b8) are usually called \u2018ray equations\u2019, and form the basis of the advection \npart in phase-averaged wave models. Finally, the action of each component is allowed to \nevolve as it propagates, with a rate of change given by the total source term Stot.  \nIn the deep ocean, spectral components are indeed shown to propagate according to (7.1). The \nrotation of the Earth has a negligible influence on wave propagation (Backus, 1962), and \nindividual wave components of the spectrum travel along great circles until they reach \nshallow water, strong currents, or coast lines. This was powerfully demonstrated by \nSnodgrass et al. (1966), who followed wave propagation a third of the way around the globe. \nIn shallow water, and in the absence of significant currents, the validity of (7.1) was also \ndemonstrated by Munk and Traylor (1947), and many following studies. As a matter of fact, \nthe propagation of long period swells over a relatively narrow continental shelf with no \nsignificant current is generally well described by (7.1), with the right hand side set to zero \noutside of the surf zone (e.g., O\u2019Reilly and Guza, 1993; Peak, 2004).  \nThe two forms of the left hand side of (7.1), the Lagrangian derivative following a wave \npacket, or the Eulerian derivative plus divergence of action fluxes, are rigorously equivalent. \nThe first form was originally proved for steady conditions without current (Longuet-Higgins, \n1957) and is easily used in backward or forward ray-tracing methods of solution. The second \nis most easily translated into methods with discretized physical and spectral spaces, and where \naction transports based on characteristic velocities are considered in each space. Such an \nequation takes the form of a spectral action balance equation rather than a conservation \nequation. It can be constructed for arbitrary descriptions of spectral space, as long as the \nJacobean transformation from N(k) to the alternative description of spectral space is well \nbehaved (Tolman and Booij, 1998, Appendix A). It should be noted that this is generally not \nthe case for spectra described in terms of the absolute frequency and direction, because the \ncorresponding Jacobean has a singularity at the blocking point. Numerical issues that arise in \nthe solution of (7.1) are discussed in section 8.  \nUnfortunately, GO may be inadequate for some situations. Further, currents effects \nrepresented in (7.1) are still poorly validated quantitatively, even by laboratory experiments, \nand some observed effects of currents are not understood.  \n \n7.2.  Limitations of geometrical optics: diffraction, reflection and random scattering \nWhenever the water depth D or the current changes on the scale of the wavelength, deviations \nfrom geometrical optics are expected. A classical example is the propagation of waves past a \nsemi-infinite and absorbing breakwater with the wave field diffracted behind the breakwater. \nA general representation of the variation in the wave field at the scale of the wavelength \nrequires a phase resolving model that accounts for the interference patterns, particularly in \nareas of crossing wave rays (e.g., Berkhof, 1972; Dalrymple and Kirby, 1988; Athanassoulis \nand Belibassakis, 1999). However, the representation of the effect of diffraction on scales \nlarger than the wavelength can be included in (7.1) by a proper modification of C\u03b8 (e.g. \nHolthuijsen et al., 2003). For natural topographies, the geometrical optics approximation is \ngenerally quite robust. This fact was confirmed by the 2003 Near Canyon Experiment, off La \nJolla, California, where the bottom slopes reach 3\/1 on the walls of Scripps canyon (Peak, \n2004). Over such a topography, deviations from geometrical optics are significant only in a \nsmall area around the head of Scripps canyon, where the wave height has been found to vary \nby a factor up to 5 over about half a wavelength (Magne et al., 2005a). \nAnother much discussed limitation of GO is the appearance of the infamous caustics. Caustics \nare the crossing points of initially parallel wave rays, and would lead to infinite wave heights \nat these points, according to GO, in the case of monochromatic waves. These caustics do not \nlead to any problem when spectral waves are considered, and this is why backward ray-\ntracing may be preferred to forward ray-tracing (e.g., O\u2019Reilly and Guza, 1993).  \nWhere the water depth goes to zero, on the shoreline, waves are partially reflected. This is \ngenerally represented by empirical reflection coefficients in phase-resolving models for wave \npropagation around artificial coastlines, but it may also be important on natural shorelines, \nincluding beaches (Elgar et al., 1994) and cliffs (O\u2019Reilly et al., 1999). Such a reflection may \nbe introduced in phase-averaged models as a proper boundary condition for (7.1). Partial \nwave reflection also occurs over any bottom topography. This is generally negligible, but \nsignificant reflection occurs when the depth changes on the scale of the wavelength \n(Heathershaw, 1982; Elgar et al., 2003). This phenomenon is formally similar to the scattering \nof long electromagnetic waves over the ocean surface, a phenomenon used for mapping sea \nsurface currents with High-Frequency radars. For linear waves, it can be represented by a \nBragg-like bottom scattering source term Sbscat in the right-hand side of (7.1) (Ardhuin and \nHerbers, 2002; Magne and Ardhuin, 2006). This source term accounts for the interaction of \ntriads involving two wave trains and one bottom Fourier component. In the form given by \nMagne and Ardhuin (2006), it also includes interactions between two waves and one Fourier \ncomponent of the current or surface elevation that arises from the adjustment of a mean \ncurrent to the topography. This scattering theory over the current fluctuations should be \nconsistent with the theory of Bal and Chou (2002) for the scattering of gravity-capillary \nwaves over depth-uniform and irrotational current fluctuations.  \nThe relative accuracy of reflections coefficient given by Sbscat was found to be proportional to \nthe ratio of the bottom amplitude and water depth, regardless of bottom slope. Reflection \ncoefficients may thus be obtained from any bottom topography of small amplitude, including \nsteps or ramps, as can be seen by the correspondence between the Green function method and \nFourier transforms (Elter and Molyneux, 1972; Mei and Hancock, 2003; Magne et al., 2005b). \nThe source term does not give accurate results, however, when particular phase relationships \nexist between interacting waves and bottom undulations, e.g. in cases with waves propagating \nover nearshore sand bars and reflecting over the beach (Yu and Mei, 2000). Except for such \nconditions, the evolution of wave action over scales larger than the bottom autocorrelation \nlength, is very well predicted by Sbscat, in agreement with phase-resolving models for wave \npropagation in one dimension (Mei, 1985; Kirby, 1988). On natural continental shelves with \nbottom elevation variances of the order of 1 m2 for scales in the range of 0.5 to 5 times the \nwavelength, this scattering term yields a strong broadening of the directional spectrum over a \nfew kilometers for kD\u22481. This predicted broadening was confirmed by observations of the \nevolution of narrow offshore directional wave spectra across the North Carolina shelf \n(Ardhuin et al., 2003), although it accounted for only half of the broadening of relatively \nbroad offshore spectra. For organized bottom topographies such as the sandwave fields found \nin the southern North Sea, a strong broadening is expected for narrow swell spectra, with an \nadditional weak reflection, depending on the swell direction relative to the current and the \nsandwave crests (Magne and Ardhuin, 2006).  \nThis type of scattering by random media perturbations is quite general (e.g., Ryzhik et al., \n1996) and can be extended to other current perturbations that may be rotational and unrelated \nto the topography. Such a calculation is yet to be made. Although Laplace\u2019s equation does not \nhold in that case, one may use an equation for the pressure (e.g., Kirby and Lee, 1993) or a \nforced Laplace equation (e.g., McWilliams et al., 2004), or work from the Hamiltonian \n(Rayevskiy 1983). With that approach a scattering source term was derived by Rayevskiy \n(1983) for waves over random current and a corresponding diffusion approximation was \nderived. This effect is found to be potentially important and was further studied by Fabrikant \nand Raevsky (1994). For example, these authors found that unidirectional waves of 40 m \nwavelength in a drift flow of a few centimetres per second evolve into directional waves with \na spread of 6o in a few kilometres of propagation. \n For large bottom amplitudes or steeper waves, higher order interactions are expected to be \nrelevant (Liu and Yue, 1998). Such interactions have been observed for periodic and one-\ndimensional bottom topographies (Rey et al., 1996). The bottom topography may act as a \ncatalyst, making near-resonant triad wave interactions (see section 5) exactly resonant. Again, \nthe proper form of the higher order scattering term is yet to be derived for random waves.  \n \n7.3.  Waves over varying currents, non-linear wave effects and the advection velocity \nA proper description of wave propagation over currents is not only necessary for the \nforecasting of waves over large-scale currents such as the Gulf Stream or the Agulhas current, \nor tidal currents on continental shelves. It is also a key element for the interpretation of \nremote-sensing observations. This applies to microwave radar or radiometers from satellites, \nused for measuring anything from sea surface height, current and wave heights, to sea surface \nsalinity and winds. In that case the instrument is sensitive to short (few centimeters) waves \nthat are modulated by the orbital velocities of the longer waves, with additional effects of \nsurface slopes and accelerations (see, e.g., Henyey et al., 1988, and Elfouhaily et al., 2001). \nThis also applies to High-Frequency radars, a now popular instrument for mapping coastal \n\u2018currents\u2019, or more specifically the phase velocity of a waves of a given wavenumber k. That \nvelocity is the intrinsic phase speed k\u03c3\/k2 plus the advection velocity UA(k). A proper \napproximation for UA(k) is the depth-integrated mean drift velocity UL, in which the depth-\nintegration is weighted by the profile of the Stokes drift of the wave component (k), that is, to \nthe lowest order of approximation (Andrews and McIntyre, 1978),  \n \nUA(k) = \u222b UL(z) kcosh[2k(z+H)]\/sinh(2kD)dz      (7.2) \n \nwhere -H is the mean elevation of the bottom and D is the mean water depth, which is H plus \nthe mean surface elevation. Such an expression is consistent with the approximate solutions of \nKirby and Chen (1989) and McWilliams et al. (2004) for weak vertical shears and small \namplitude waves. In that case the drift current UL is approximately the mean current velocity \n\u00fb. However, a more general approximation for not-so-small waves is, UL= \u00fb+Us where Us is \nthe Stokes drift due to the entire wave field. In the case of short wave advection by long \nwaves, with a clear scale separation, Broche et al. (1983) showed that (7.2) is consistent with \nthe theory of Weber and Barrick (1977). In remains to be proved that (7.2), or a more accurate \nversion of it, is also consistent with the known amplitude dispersion of Stokes waves, or other \ntheories for the dispersion of waves in a random wave field (Hayes, 1973; Willebrand, 1975; \nHuang and Tung, 1976; Masuda et al., 1979), short wave modulation by long waves (Phillips \n1981), and finite amplitude waves over shear currents (e.g., Dalrymple, 1974; Peregrine, \n1976). \nIn practice wave models and most users of HF-radars assume that UL is uniform over the \ndepth. This is probably a good approximation for swells propagating over large-scale \ngeostrophic, tidal or wind-driven currents, as the current velocity \u00fb is generally uniform close \nthe surface due to the strong mixing induced by wave breaking (Santala and Terray, 1992; \nTerray et al., 2000). However, a differential advection of shorter waves by the sheared Stokes \ndrift is to be expected. Fore reference, Us at the surface it is typically 1 to 1.5% of the local 10 \nm wind speed for fully-developed waves. Further, the advection velocities of short and long \nwaves propagating in stratified estuaries are also expected to be markedly different due to \nvertical shears of \u00fb. To our knowledge nobody has yet tried to verify that latter effect. The \ncommon practice of using the surface velocity is expected to be generally valid. \nThe near-surface drift velocity UA is known to modify the wave heights by a combination of \nthree effects. We consider monochromatic waves for the sake of simplicity. First of all, the \nconservation of the wave action flux means that in cases of along-crest uniform conditions, a \ngradient of UA in the direction of propagation should result in a change of the local action \ndensity in order to keep (Cg+UA)A constant. Specifically, for waves against an increasingly \nstrong current, Cg is reduced as the wavelength gets shorter and Cg+UA is made even smaller \nby the change of UA. Second, the change in surface elevation variance E=A\/\u03c3 is amplified \ncompared to A due to the change in the intrinsic frequency \u03c3. Third and last, UA generally \nvaries along the wave crests so that current-induced refraction leads to further local increases \nof wave heights for waves propagating against a current jet. For weak current shears the \ncurrent-induced refraction gives a ray curvature radius equal to the ratio of the wave group \nspeed and the current vertical vorticity (Landau and Lifshitz 1960). This combination of \neffects for the wave height and the associated change in wavelength makes current fronts a \npreferential site of wave breaking. Current jets, from large scales to river mouths are one of \nthe most hazardous areas for navigation (e.g., Gutshabash and Lavrenov, 1986; Masson, \n1996).  \nPractical wave forecasting in which currents are taken into account are, to this day, limited to \ntidal currents (e.g. at the UK Met Office). Quasi-geostrophic currents are probably not \nobserved or predicted well enough in order to perform these calculations. This may change \nwith the advent of absolute measurements of the ocean dynamic height, using the latest high-\nresolution measurements of the geoid. Large benefits are expected for the forecasting of \nextreme waves.  \nOn smaller scales, when current variations are significant over one wavelength, partial wave \nreflection occurs. The two cases of current discontinuity (Evans, 1975) and slowly varying \ncurrent (McKee, 1974) have been well investigated. A Mild Shear Equation analogous to the \nMild Slope Equation, was derived and extended by McKee (1996). Effects of evanescent \nmodes have also been considered by Belibassakis and Athanassoulis (2004). Partial wave \nreflection may be relevant for the wave-current interactions that occur in Langmuir \ncirculations (Smith, 1980; Verron and Melville, 2001), the essential mixing engine in the \nocean mixed layer. Indeed, the vortex force that drives Langmuir circulations only exists as a \ncompensation of the divergence of the wave momentum flux that occurs when waves refract \nover the current pattern (Garrett, 1976). Analytical solutions suggest that such reflections are \ngenerally weak for typical dominant wind waves with periods of a few seconds, except for \ngrazing incidence angles. However in that case the effect is minimal since the reflected and \nincident wave directions are almost identical.  \n \n7.4.  Waves blocking \nWave blocking occurs where opposing currents are sufficiently strong to stop wave \npropagation in physical space, i.e. where Cg+UA(k)=0. In a traditional monochromatic \ngeometric optics approach, a singularity occurs in the wave energy equation at the blocking \npoint, where the wave action and energy fluxes converge. However, Shyu and Phillips (1990) \nhave shown that a continuous solution exists on both sides of the blocking point. Furthermore, \na spectral approach leads to continuous non-crossing characteristics in (x-k) space, indicating \nthat no singularity exists in a spectral description of wave propagation. Laboratory \nobservations of wave blocking (Lai et al, 1989; Chawla and Kirby, 2002; Suastika and \nBattjes, 2005) clearly validate the concept of a blocking point. However, the mechanism by \nwhich the wave energy is `removed\u2019 at the blocking point does not seem to be understood yet. \n \n7.5.  Unsteady water depths and currents \nTraditionally, waves propagating over stationary currents have been considered. This \napproach is valid for conditions where the currents are (quasi-) stationary on time scales \ncomparable with the propagation time of waves through the area. This is generally the case \nfor persistent deep-ocean currents like the Gulf Stream, or for current patterns related to \nbathymetric features such as shoals, headlands and inlets. However, many of the current fields \nin shelf seas are related to tides. A free travelling tidal wave travels much faster than a wind \nwave and therefore results in a quasi-homogeneous rather than quasi-stationary current field. \nSuch temporal variations of currents result in Doppler shifts only (Tolman, 1990). In many \npractical applications, interactions occur due to both spatial and temporal variations of the \ncurrent field (Barber, 1949; Tolman, 1991).  \n \n7.6.  Waves in the real ocean \nThe occurrence of other types of motions (e.g. internal waves) or special boundary conditions \n(sea ice, surface films) have significant effects over the wave motion. Although such \nsituations are frequent, they are generally neglected except for the effect of sea ice. Ice is as a \npowerful attenuator of waves propagating from the open ocean (Wadhams, 1978) and \ngenerally prevents any wind-wave generation of significance to the ice-free ocean (Croker \nand Wadhams, 1983). Still, 1 m high swells have been observed to break up the ice as far as \n500 km from the ice edge, making navigation difficult (Liu and Mollo-Christensen, 1988). As \nfor the other conditions, there is clear evidence of attenuation of waves by oil poured on the \nsea surface, an ancient technique for ship rescue operations. Theory on surface waves \u2013\ninternal wave interactions lead to possible large changes in the surface wave energy \n(Kudryavtsev, 1994) with observed significant wave generation by large amplitude internal \nwaves (Osborne and Burch, 1980). Further research on these processes is clearly needed, with \nan evaluation of their impact in numerical wave models.  \n \n8. Numerics and Resolution in Large-scale Wave Modelling \n \nby  \nW. Erick Rogersy, Hendrik L. Tolmand, Fabrice Ardhuinl, and Igor V. Lavrenovg \n \nAlthough most efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the physical processes \nresponsible for the evolution of the wave action spectrum, mathematically represented by eq. \n(8.1), it must be recognized that the choice of a numerical method for arriving at the solution \nmay be the source of large errors in the results (Tolman, 1992). In this section we provide a \ndescription of the basic problem, related both the finite description of the physical world and \nto the time step integration. We analyze the related existing solutions. Then we discuss the \nrelative importance of the various sources of error, with a look at the future. \n \n8.1.  A description of the problem \n \nTwo fundamentally different approaches have been used for solving (8.1). The ray method, \nusing backward ray-tracing to avoid caustics, is convenient and very efficient for steady \nmedia, where the rays need to be computed only once (e.g., Cavaleri and Malanotte-Rizzoli, \n1981).  \nThe advantages of the grid method are that conservation of action can be enforced rigorously, \nand that the inclusion of nonlinear source terms is straightforward with a splitting of the \nintegration time step in advection and source term integration. Problems with grid methods \nare that high spatial resolution is required for an accurate description of bathymetric and \ntopographic effects, and high spectral resolution is required for accurate swell propagation \nover large distances. It should be noted that where the same governing equation is solved, the \ndifferent numerical methods should ideally produce the same result, as demonstrated in \nHolthuijsen and Tolman (1991), for example.  \n \nError due to the numerical scheme for geographic propagation on a grid \nFor the purpose of discussion, we pose the wave model governing equation in one-\ndimensional form, with uniform group velocity, no source terms, and only one spectral \ncomponent (frequency\/directional bin) considered: \n0=\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\nx\nNCN\nt gx\n.         (8.1) \nWhen this continuous equation is discretized using finite differencing, numerical error occurs. \nTo give an example, if one uses the explicit, first-order upwind scheme of the WAM model, \nthe numerical error (or truncation error) is the right-hand side of the following equation (from \nPetit 2001): \n+\u2202\n\u2202\u2212\u2212\u0394\u2212\u2202\n\u2202\u2212\u0394=\u2202\n\u2202+\u2202\n\u2202\n3\n3\n2\n2\n2\n)21)(1(\n6\n1)1(\n2\n1\nx\nNxC\nx\nNxC\nx\nNCN\nt gxgxgx\n\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc  \n)()166)(1(\n24\n1 4\n4\n4\n23 xO\nx\nNxCgx \u0394+\u2202\n\u2202+\u2212\u2212\u0394 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc ,   (8.2) \nxtCgx \u0394\u0394= \/\u03bcwhere\u03bc  is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number, . Thus, we can see \nthat numerical geographic propagation error is dependent on several dimensional quantities: \n1. geographic resolution, \n2. the time step, \n3. the speed of propagation, and \n4. the curvature of the field of spectral density, and\/or various other spatial derivatives of \nthis field. \nThis may also be posed as a dependence on two dimensionless quantities: \n1. the CFL number, which quantifies the number of grid spaces traversed by a packet of \nenergy in one time step, and \n2. the geographic resolution relative to the scale of the feature in the wave field which is \nbeing propagated. (In (8.1), \u201cscale\u201d would be in the x-space.) All else being equal, a \nlarger-scale feature will have smaller gradients; if these gradients are small, the \nnumerical error will tend to be small. \nDiffusion \nThe term \u201cnumerical diffusion\u201d is used in this paper to describe the unintended spreading or \nsmearing of wave energy during propagation due to discretization of a continuous problem. \nMore specifically, it is due to even-ordered truncation error terms in the governing equation \nfinite differencing associated with propagation, e.g. (8.2). The behaviors of individual \nschemes are rather unique. With any proper numerical scheme, diffusion becomes small at \nvery high resolutions, but does not necessarily do so in a monotonic fashion. Dependence on \nCFL is even more varied. For example with increasing CFL, diffusion of the implicit first \norder upwind scheme (for most resolutions) will increase, while diffusion of the explicit first \norder upwind scheme will decrease until it becomes zero at 0.1=\u03bc . In the two-dimensional \ncase, some schemes are more sensitive to propagation direction than others; the first order \nscheme of WAM is especially notorious for this (see Fig. 1 of WAMDIG, 1988). \nIn some computation fluid dynamics literature, this diffusion is referred to as \u201cdissipation\u201d. \nWe do not use the term \u201cdissipation\u201d, since that would improperly imply to most wave \nmodelers a loss of energy. Diffusion does not directly cause a loss of energy: the numerical \nschemes of widely-used 3G wave models (WAM, WW3, SWAN) are energy-conserving. \nNumerical dispersion \nNumerical dispersion is the practical effect of the odd-ordered truncation error terms in the \ngoverning equation finite differencing associated with propagation, e.g. (8.2) (In the context \nof a wave model, one should specify that this is numerical dispersion, to avoid confusion with \nphysical dispersion. Like diffusion, numerical dispersion is dependent on CFL number and \nrelative resolution. Consider a geographic feature in the wave spectral density field as a \n\u201csignal\u201d being propagated. Due to the discrete representation of a finite difference model, the \ncelerity of different Fourier components of this signal deviate from the proper celerity of the \nsignal (which is the group velocity calculated by the wave model); thus the Fourier \ncomponents \u201cdisperse\u201d as this feature is propagated in the model.  \nCombined effect of diffusion and dispersion \nThe error in celerity tends to be greater for the shorter Fourier components. As numerical \ndispersion occurs, two things can happen to the shorter components: they can either be \nsmoothed by numerical diffusion (merging with the longer components), or become visible in \nthe solution. In the latter case, the components are referred to as numerical oscillations or \n\u201cwiggles\u201d. The wiggles do not indicate model instability, but they do have an entirely \nunnatural appearance, and should therefore be prevented. The most straightforward way to do \nthis is to employ a numerical scheme which tends to produce dispersion and diffusion in \nroughly equal portions; another method is to intentionally add diffusion as a separate term in \nthe governing equation (denoted below \u201ccontrolled diffusion\u201d to distinguish it from \n\u201cnumerical diffusion\u201d, which is a type of error). \nError due to the numerical scheme for spectral propagation \nLike propagation in geographic space, propagation in spectral space is treated with finite \ndifferencing methods in all widely-used 3G wave models. As such, it is subject to the same \ntypes of numerical error (diffusion and dispersion).  \nError due to coarse geographic resolution \nWe have already mentioned that geographic resolution has a strong influence on numerical \nerror (diffusion and dispersion). It can also affect model accuracy in a manner not directly \nrelated to numerics. This tends to be most noticeable in shelf-scale and nearshore \napplications, but can also be apparent in large-scale models. In the latter case, if an island or \npeninsula is not well represented by the computational grid, then the blocking and scattering \nof wave energy by this land mass will not be well represented. Present-day global wave \nmodels are computed at 0.5-1.5\u00b0 resolution; at these resolutions, some island groups will not \nbe represented at all in the computational grid, which will lead to a persistent underprediction \nof the blocking\/scattering of energy. \nIn cases where high resolution (finer than 1\u00b0) ocean-scale wind forcing is available, there may \nbe some benefit to running the wave model at comparable resolution. This, of course, depends \non the scale of meteorological features and the wave model\u2019s sensitivity to these features.   \nError due to coarse spectral resolution \nWhen spectral (frequency\/directional) discretization is too coarse for the scale of propagation, \naphysical discontinuities manifest in the wave field as natural dispersion occurs. In the \nextreme case, as a propagating swell field propagates, it disintegrates into discrete geographic \nfeatures, with each feature corresponding to a frequency\/directional bin in the model\u2019s \ncomputational grid. This is known as the \u201cgarden sprinkler effect\u201d (GSE) (e.g., SWAMP \nGroup, 1985). \nWith higher order propagation schemes, the GSE is unfortunately more apparent. Numerical \ndiffusion, though it is an error, has the positive quality of tending to counteract the garden \nsprinkler effect, smoothing these discrete features together. Note, however, that numerical \ndiffusion in existing models is unrelated to physical dispersion and is not controlled, so it \ndoes not properly mimic the natural dispersion of continuous spectra. In fact, the GSE can be \nclearly observed in WAM predictions of very old swell fields, despite the diffusive first-order \nscheme of WAM. \nThe GSE is not limited to propagation of swells across great distances: the directional GSE \n(i.e. the part of GSE related to directional discretization of the wave spectrum) is sometimes \nseen in the lee of islands: in these cases, the gradation between \u201cilluminated\u201d and \u201cshadowed\u201d \nareas is stepwise, rather than smooth. \nTolman (1995) demonstrates that the conventionally used frequency resolution may be \ninadequate insofar as the spectral peak is not well represented during the growth stage, \nleading to incorrect dispersion of resulting swell (this is not the GSE, so it is not addressed by \nGSE-correcting methods described in sub-section 8.2. \nErrors in source term integration \nThe integration in time of the source terms is usually performed in a separate \u2018fractional step\u2019 \nof a wave model. In this step, the following equation is solved \nS\nt\nF =\u2202\n\u2202       (8.3) \nThe simplest way to solve this equation is a simple first order Euler approach \n \ntSFF nn \u0394+=+1      (8.4) \nwhere n is the discrete time counter and \u0394t is the discrete time step. The main difficulty with \nintegrating the source terms in time is the inherently small time scales involved with this \nprocess, particularly at higher frequencies. When the simple Euler approach is used, the \nattainable time step is at the best of the order of minutes. For early third generation wave \nmodels, this was unacceptable, and methods were developed to be able to integrate the source \nterms with time steps of about 20 minutes. The WAM group (WAMDIG, 1988) solved this \nproblem in two ways. First, the Euler approach of (8.4) was replaced by a semi-implicit \nmethod \nt\ntD\nSFF nn \u0394\u0394\u2212+=\n+\n\u03b11\n1      (8.5) \nwhere D represents the diagonal contributions of the partial derivative of  S with respect to F. \nThe parameter \u03b1 represents the centricity of the scheme. Originally, it was set to \u03b1 = 0.5, \nmaking this scheme central in time. More recently \u03b1 = 1 is favored. This makes the scheme \nlower in order, but increases the stability of the integration. Particularly, oscillations are \navoided at higher frequencies, as the scheme more properly represents a root finder for the \nquasi-steady solution that dominates the source term integration in the equilibrium range of \nthe spectrum (e.g., Hargreaves and Annan, 2001). Introducing the semi-implicit scheme is not \nsufficient to allow for time steps of the order of 20 minutes. The WAM model therefore used \na so-called limiter, which sets a maximum allowable (absolute) change \u0394F per time step \u0394t. \nThe combination of the semi-implicit scheme and the limiter resulted in stable model \nintegration with large time steps. The limiter of WAM Cycles 1-3 had the favorable \ncharacteristic of not affecting the solution for small time steps (in other words, as the time \nstep size approaches zero, the solution will \u201cconverge\u201d to the solution of the model without a \nlimiter). However, since the limiter was not prescribed as a function of time step size, the \neffect of the limiter was shown to be rather sensitive to the time step size, particularly for \ninitial wave growth (Tolman 1992).  \n8.2.  Existing solutions \nImproved numerical schemes for propagation on a grid \nBoth WAM and WW3 have higher order schemes which can be employed instead of the \nexplicit, first order upwind scheme. The higher order scheme of WAM is the second order \nleapfrog scheme (which has zero numerical diffusion). The higher order scheme of WW3 is \nthe \u201cULTIMATE QUICKEST\u201d scheme and limiter (see Tolman, 1995; Leonard, 1979; Davis \nand Moore, 1982, and Leonard, 1991). The QUICKEST scheme is third order when solved in \none dimension. In the case of WAM, the higher order scheme is, to our knowledge, rarely \nused. In the case of WW3, it is the suggested numerical scheme (used for both geographic and \nspectral propagation). So-called \u201ctotal variance diminishing\u201d limiters can be used to control \nwiggles (the reader is referred to Leonard (1991) for a description of the scheme used in \nWW3 and Fletcher (1988) for a general overview). \nNumerical schemes are sometimes presented in the literature in one-dimensional form. For \napplication in a wave model, they must obviously be extended to two geographic dimensions. \nThere exist more than one method for doing this, and the efficacy of the extension method will \ndepend on the scheme being extended. One method is to solve for propagation in both \ndimensions simultaneously, with each finite difference term being equivalent to the one-\ndimensional form. A second method\u2014the fractional step method\u2014is to propagate each \ndimension in sequence, with each operation being identical to the one-dimensional operation \n(see e.g. Yanenko 1971). In either of these methods, the order of accuracy of the scheme \nshould be expected to decrease compared to the one-dimensional equivalent. A third method \nis the \u201cProduct Generalization\u201d method of Petit (2001) which preserves the order of accuracy \nof the one-dimensional scheme; this extension method may be prohibitively expensive in \nmany cases. \nThe SWAN model uses an implicit propagation scheme which is second order when solved in \ntwo dimensions; this model is less efficient than WAM or WW3 applied at oceanic scales. \nOther schemes have been proposed, such as semi-Lagrangian schemes (e.g., Lavrenov and \nOnvlee, 1995), using analytical ray-tracing solutions to search the grid for the position of \nwave packets at the previous time-step.  \nAlternatives to the finite difference schemes on a grid. \nThe oldest wave forecasting models have been based on the propagation of energy or action \nalong wave rays, which are geodesic lines in deep water. The ray method is ideally suited for \naddressing long-distance swell propagation, for which the source terms on the right hand side \nof (8.1) may be neglected, with minimal numerical accuracy issues. Among such models, The \nNavy Swell Model (Hsu et al., 2004) is a ray-tracing model; propagation within this model \ncontains virtually no error associated with numerics and resolution. This model contains no \nsource\/sink terms (e.g. swell attenuation is not represented). This model is initialized using \nspectral density fields from of WAM simulations. The initialization fields thus are affected by \nnumerical error of the input model. Nevertheless, it is useful for creating long-range swell \nforecasts and as a research tool. \nRay-based advection also disconnects the advection along rays, which are different for each \ncomponent, from the grid where the wave spectra are put together. This allows an easy use of \nunstructured grids (e.g., Benoit et al., 1996), or no grid at all; some models are used for \nforecasts at a single point (e.g., the Navy Swell Model, Hsu et al., 2004). The main advantage \nof ray-based advection is that it does the spectral and spatial advection in a single step, with \nvirtually no numerical diffusion. Some numerical diffusion is still introduced if the same rays \nare not followed all the way to the model boundaries (Ardhuin and Herbers, 2005).  \nA potential drawback of ray-based advection is the greater difficulty of ensuring a \nconservation of the total wave action over a given area, although there is no evidence of a \nlesser accuracy on modelled wave parameter. However, the largest challenge is the integration \nof source terms if the rays are followed over more than one time step in order to benefit from \nthe low diffusion. Several levels of complexity have been tested. Cavaleri and Malanotte-\nRizzoli (1981) have thus restrained their representation of source terms to parameterization \nthat are local in the spectrum, i.e. S(k) is a function of A(k) and external parameters only (see \nalso Lavrenov, 2003). In order to be able to use generic parameterization, the rays must be \nlinked to the grids where the spectra are assembled. This was done by Ardhuin et al. (2001) \nfor application to bottom friction and that approach has been used to hindcast fetch-limited \ngrowth with both the DIA parameterization and the Webb-Resio-Tracy method for estimating \nnonlinear interactions, with very good agreement with finite-difference models (Ardhuin et \nal., 2006). \nSince high-spectral resolution is mostly needed for swells, and swell attenuation may be \ndescribed as a fully linear process (e.g., Kudryavtsev and Makin, 2004), there should be some \nbenefit in computing swell and wind sea evolutions with different methods, even on a global \nscale. Such benefits for swell hindcasting in the coastal ocean were demonstrated by Ardhuin \net al. (2003) and Ardhuin and Herbers (2005). A careful comparison of ray-based advection \nwith finite difference schemes would probably provide useful guidance. Further, alternative \nmethods using unstructured grids are also possible. These are not necessarily less diffusive \nbut provide an efficient use of a variable grid resolution when details are needed close to the \ncoast. Hsu et al. (2005) proposed a Taylor-Galerkin FEM method to solve the spatial \nadvection discretized to second order.  \nAddressing error due to coarse geographic resolution \nThe approach of Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center has been to simply \nincrease resolution (the global WW3 implementation, from 1\u00b0 to 1\/2\u00b0 resolution). In this case, \nthe computation time of the propagation routines of the model is increased by a factor of eight \n(23, for two geographic dimensions and for the increased temporal resolution, to satisfy the \nstability criterion). \nThe approach of Hardy et al. (2000) is to represent the blocking\/scattering of wave energy by \ntopography using sub-grid approximations. With this method, a transparency matrix that is \ndependent on wave direction and geographic location is specified within the model. Similar \nmethods have been adopted with the WAVEWATCH-III model (Tolman, 2003) and with the \nWAM model at ECMWF (Bidlot et al., 2005; Janssen et al., 2005). \nGeographic resolution is of obvious importance to shelf-scale and nearshore applications. In \nthat case, nesting methods are available in all 3G models. For example, Lahoz and Albiach \n(1997) (also Albiach et al., 2000) use two-way nesting with the WAM model, with step-wise \nincreases in resolution. \nGarden Sprinkler Effect correction methods \nFor oceanic-scale models, no operational center has yet taken the approach of simply \nincreasing spectral (frequency\/directional) resolution, due to the computational cost. WAM, \nWW3, and SWAN all have the option of adding controllable diffusion to deal with the Garden \nSprinkler Effect. In the case of WAM, the controllable diffusion, like the leapfrog scheme, it \nis rarely used. In the case of WW3 and SWAN, the controllable diffusion is specified in the \nmanner of Booij and Holthuijsen (1987). WW3 also includes the option of simple grid point \naveraging, in lieu of the Booij and Holthuijsen method (Tolman, 2002a). In either case, the \nscheme requires a tuning parameter to control the degree of smoothing. Another type of \nprocedure is used by Lavrenov and Onvlee (1995), in which an angular diffusive operator is \nincluded with the advection scheme numerical realization, spreading energy in directional \nspace. \nErrors in source term integration \nThree solutions have been applied in operational models to remove the sensitivity of the \nresults to the time step size described in the previous sub-section. \nTolman (1992, 2002b) dynamically adjusts the time step, using the limiter to compute the \nmaximum allowed time step. This results in a numerically accurate solution of (8.3). For \nlarge-scale model applications, this method was found to be very economical; average global \nmodel time steps of up to 40 minutes could be attained. For small scale applications, where \nrapid wind and wave changes occur over the entire domain at once, this approach can still \nbecome fairly expensive, because of the small time steps involved. \nIn WAM Cycle 4, the limiter was made proportional to the time step size (see Hersbach and \nJanssen, 1999). This modification greatly reduces the dependence on the time step size, but \nalso prevents convergence of the solution: for very small time steps, the model does not \nconverge to the solution of the model with no limiter (Hersbach and Janssen, 1999, Fig. 4). \nThe disadvantage with non-convergent limiters is that the limiter becomes part of the solution, \nand appears to result in significant impacts on the spectral shape, even if wave heights are \nwell represented (see Tolman, 2002b). This is especially noticeable in cases of fast wave \ngrowth (short-fetch applications).  \nHersbach and Janssen (1999) reformulated the limiter of WAM4 to remove the time step \ndependence from the solutions. This scheme is still non-convergent, but does appear to be \nmuch closer to convergence than the earlier WAM4 limiter (Hersbach and Janssen, 1999, \ncompare their Figures 4 and 5).  The primary advantage of this method is that cheap and \nrobust model results are obtained, without notable time step dependencies. \nAn alternative for the time source term integration can be based on a spreading numerical \nmethod (Lavrenov and Kozhevnikov, 2003; Lavrenov, 2003). It uses the semi-analytical \nsolution for integration source term which includes the wind wave input, dissipation term, and \nexact non-linear energy transfer function. The authors present an idealized test case in which \nreliable and stable results are achieved for time steps as large as three hours without limiters. \n8.3.  Relative importance of problem \nIn this section, we discuss the relative importance of errors of numerics and resolution. This \ndiscussion is deliberately separated from the previous descriptions, since it contains some \nsubjective statements (or, at least, statements that are not possible to prove here). Further \nwarning to the reader: be wary of generalizations on the subject of error in wave modeling; \nthey are rarely, if ever, universal. \nError due to the numerical scheme for geographic propagation \nIs it worthwhile to use higher order propagation schemes, or is a first order scheme sufficient? \nThere is some controversy to this, so we present two points of view here (both are essentially \ncorrect). Note that there are implications for future directions: if the accuracy of a model with \na first order propagation scheme is similar to that of a model with a third order scheme, this \nfurther implies that the benefit of upgrade (e.g. from third order to fifth order) will be trivial.  \nArgument \nIn a majority of papers that treat the subject of numerical error, there is at least one \npresentation of a spike of wave energy, which is supposed to represent a swell field, \npropagated with a first order scheme. The signal is, of course, greatly diffused. This naturally \nleads readers to believe that swell predictions with a first order scheme will not bear even the \nfaintest resemblance to nature. This conclusion is incorrect for two reasons. First, the \ncurvature of the wave field\u2014and higher order derivatives\u2014are very rarely this extreme in \nnature, so the demonstrated level of diffusion is extreme. Secondly, only one spectral \ncomponent is represented in this simple case. In an actual model, at any given location, \nnumerical error of all spectral components will rarely be of the same sign; the effect of \nnumerical geographic propagation error on wave height (i.e. the integrated wave spectrum) \nwill tend to be relatively smaller than its effect on individual spectral components. It was \nshown by Rogers (2002) that the difference in error statistics (root-mean-square error and \nbias) between two models (one with a first order scheme, the other with more accurate \npropagation) can be trivial, even if only very old swells are considered. \nCounter-argument \nIf methods are available to compute propagation more accurately without a large increase in \ncomputation time, then these methods should be used. Wave modelers should not be satisfied \nwith continued reliance on cancellation of errors via spectral integration, since this hinders \nfurther model development and leaves significant errors in the spectral distribution of energy. \nFurther, even if error statistics are not particularly sensitive to the accuracy of propagation, a \nmodel with more accurate propagation will produce images of geographic distributions of \nswell fields that are much more realistic in appearance than would be produced with first-\norder numerics. The difference, though aesthetic, is important to operational forecasters. \nFurther, a diffusive propagation scheme makes it much more difficult to identify individual \nswell fields in a time series (Wingeart et al., 2001). Also, error in spectral distribution due to \ndiffusion and dispersion make it more difficult to calculate the origins of swell energy. Lastly, \neven if model wave height bias is not sensitive to numerical accuracy in the open ocean, it has \nbeen demonstrated that it can be very sensitive in cases where strong gradients exist (e.g., in \nthe lee of islands in shelf-scale applications, Rogers et al., 2002).  \nError due to the numerical scheme for spectral propagation \nThis subject has received attention in the literature only in limited cases, e.g. Tolman (1991), \npg. 791, where it is shown that in cases of significant propagation (i.e. refraction by \nbathymetry and currents), a first order scheme for propagation in directional space leads to \nbroader directional distributions. Thus far, there has been little to suggest that it should be a \nconcern. Implementation of surface current input for wave models (such as the Gulf Stream) \nwill make this numerical error more important. \nGeographic resolution \nOn the subject of blocking and scattering by unresolved topography, the practical effect \nfollows common sense: there is a significant positive bias near island groups, which tends to \nvanish in the far-field. The method of Tolman (2003) is an effective way to address the \nproblem. \nOn the subject of resolving O(1\u00b0) variations in surface wind forcing: all else being equal, we \nexpect that more variable wind fields will produce greater wave energy, analogous to the \ntreatment of gustiness, see section 2. Once the level of variability within the integration time \nstep is known, this can be taken into account using the procedure presently in use at ECMWF \n(Janssen, 2004). The time variability at the single points also implicitly represents the spatial \nvariability. Longer period variability, i.e. of the order of a few time or grid steps or more, is in \nprinciple automatically taken into account. However, as discussed in section 2, while one \nhand the meteorological models tend to underestimate the wind variability, the ECMWF \nprocedure only considers its average effect. Therefore the apparently random oscillations we \nsee in the recorded Hs time series around an otherwise smooth, e.g., growth curve are not \nrepresented or strongly smoothed in the model results. \nSpectral resolution \nThe practical effect of the Garden Sprinkler Effect (GSE) is expected to be similar to that of \nthe propagation scheme (small impact on error metrics, significant impact on aesthetics). In \ntime series of swell fields, the garden sprinkler effect associated with directional resolution \n(15\u00b0 in most operational models) is almost always more apparent than that associated with \nfrequency resolution (logarithmic spacing factor of 1.1 in most models).  The problem with \nrepresentation of the spectral peak demonstrated by Tolman (1995) does, however, suggest \nthat the factor 1.1 in frequency resolution is insufficient for accurate dispersion in global-scale \napplications. Yet, sensitivity of source\/sink terms must also be considered; choosing a too fine \nspectral resolution may cause unphysical behavior of spectral evolution (Van Vledder et al., \n2000). \nSource term integration \nWith the three mainstream 3G wave models (SWAN, WAM4, WW3) each using very \ndifferent solution methods, the relative importance of this numerical error is also different. As \nmentioned above, in the context of WW3, the primary impact of the limiter is on computation \ntime, rather than on error. SWAN uses the WAM Cycles 1-3 limiter, so growth rates are very \nsensitive to the time step size: for example, even with a time step size of five minutes, the \ngrowth rate of that model is considerably slower than that with a five second time step.  \nThe WAM4 limiter with improvements by Hersbach and Janssen (1999) appears to be much \nmore accurate than the previous WAM limiters, though still lagging behind the \u201cno limiter\u201d \ngrowth rate at early stages of growth; this occurs even for very small time step sizes, so it is \nclearly symptomatic of non-convergence. From practical experience it appears that the limiter \nof Hersbach and Janssen (1999) is a good solution for engineering problems, where the goal is \nto estimate wave conditions accurately and economically. However, it can be argued that this \nnon-convergent limiter is less suitable for scientific research of source term parameterizations, \nbecause the effects of the limiter on the final solution are difficult to assess, short of disabling \nthe limiter. \n8.4. Future solutions \nThe numerical scheme for geographic propagation \nThe objective of future development should be toward greater computational efficiency while \nmaintaining or improving the accuracy of existing numerical schemes. In this regard, semi-\nLagrangian schemes (Lavrenov and Onvlee, 1995; Ardhuin et al., 2001; Petit, 2001; Rogers \nand O\u2019Reilly, 2002) are an attractive alternative to traditional Eulerian schemes. These can be \nsimultaneously accurate, efficient, and unconditionally stable. There are two difficulties, \nhowever: \n1. For the general case where propagation speed is not uniform, ray-tracing must be \nperformed for the Lagrangian stage of the schemes, which requires some extra work. \nAssuring mass-conservation is generally less straightforward than with an Eulerian \nscheme. \n2. The primary benefit of these schemes it that a parcel of energy can be propagated a \nlong distance in a single time step, as opposed too many small steps. Thus, less error \naccumulates, and the higher the CFL number, the more accurate the propagation. \nUnfortunately, source\/sink terms must be applied along the ray at the Lagrangian stage \n(otherwise, a parcel of wave energy might skip past a storm without receiving energy \nfrom it). Doing this in a computationally efficient manner is a challenge. \nGeographic resolution \nFor shelf-scale applications, unstructured grid methods are expected to become more \nprevalent, since scales of variation tend to be small nearer to the shoreline, while at the same \ntime the offshore wave field only varies on the scale larger than that of the wind field. Thus \nhigh-resolution away from the coast is generally useless, and even in hurricane conditions a \nresolution of a few kilometers is probably adequate. Unstructured grids are already used now \nin TOMAWAC (Benoit et al., 1996), MIKE21, and have been implemented as a non-standard \nversion of the SWAN model (Hsu et al., 2005). The present version of SWAN is also able to \napply curvilinear grids allowing for finer resolution near the coast. However, the variation of \nthe aspect ratio of the grid cells may not vary too much.  \nSpectral resolution \nThe existing operational methods for dealing with the Garden Sprinkler Effect require a \ntuning parameter ostensibly related to wave age, but applied as a constant since the actual age \nof wave energy is not known to the model. Thus, there is apparent room for improvement. \nTolman (2002a) proposes a new, more correct, technique using \u201cdivergent advection\u201d but that \nmethod is still too expensive to apply. With more efficient propagation methods and\/or more \npowerful computers, it will be feasible to increase spectral resolution (the most direct method \nof addressing GSE). Increasing frequency resolution may be troublesome, since the nonlinear \ninteraction computations are sensitive to this. Thus, a reasonable approach would be to let the \nsource\/sink terms dictate frequency resolution, and gradually increase directional resolution \nas computational resources allow. At the same time there is little study on the improvements \nprovided by higher directional resolution, although it is expected that better than 15 degrees is \nprobably necessary in coastal areas with headlands and islands in order to properly define the \nshadow areas. At present a frequency resolution of 10% is recommended. This choice seems \nto be related to the shape parameter of \u03bb=0.25 of the DIA, but the motivation for this choice is \nnot clear. Applying other parameterizations of the non-linear four-wave interactions will \npossibly lead to other optimal frequency resolutions. This implies that numerics and physics \nare coupled through some parameterizations of physical processes.  \nErrors in source term integration \nAlternative non-convergent limiters have been proposed by Luo and Sclavo (1997), \nHargreaves and Annan (1998), and Monbaliu et al. (2000). A prototype for a convergent \nlimiter with reduced time step dependencies is proposed by Tolman (2002Lb. \n8.5. Numerics and resolution: Problems particular to finite depth and high resolution \napplications2\nIn shallow water the higher resolution and stronger refraction require smaller time steps when \nconditionally stable Eulerian advection schemes (based on finite differences) are used (as with \nWAM and WW3). Even with unconditionally stable advection schemes, such as that used by \n                                                 \n2 This section may be separate from the rest of the numerics\/resolution text. \nSWAN for geographic propagation, accuracy decreases with larger Courant numbers. The \ntraditional solution is to avoid the problem by switching to a stationary mode of computation \nat these smaller scales. This mode of computation inherently assumes that wave energy \npropagates across the domain instantaneously, and\u2014in the case of models that include wave \ngrowth\u2014that the wave field responds instantaneously to changes in the local wind field; both \nassumptions are reasonable at smaller scales. SWAN allows this infinite-duration mode of \ncomputation, and many nearshore models use it exclusively. At this scale, stationary models \noften have significant numerical challenges (e.g., Zijlema and Van der Westhuysen, 2005), \nbut since these problems, limitations, and solution methods are often unique to each model, \nwe cannot discuss them in detail here. \nDespite the solution of using stationary computations, there is recently some impetus to push \nexclusively nonstationary models such as WAM and WW3 closer to shore, since this avoids \nlearning, maintaining, and running multiple wave models at a given operational center. Ray-\ntracing can be very efficient to avoid the cost of very small time steps, and in coastal areas \nsource terms may often be completely neglected (e.g., O\u2019Reilly and Guza, 1993; Peak, 2004). \nIn general source terms may be important and the general problem is more the relationship \nbetween the advection and source term integration time step. Indeed, a few minutes or less is \noften needed for high resolution applications, but the source terms do not evolve on this scale \nand remain virtually unchanged over tens of minutes. The separation of these time steps \nallows great gains in CPU time in WAVEWATCH-III for example. Yet, even in the case \nwhen source terms are strong, the separation of advection and source term integration requires \nan update of the spectrum after the advection step, which is usually performed by \nrecomputing the source terms. Efficient solutions may be obtained by applying the diagonal \npart of the previously computed source term to the new but almost identical spectrum, or \nconsidering the evolution of the wave field as a series of steady state conditions, as discussed \nabove. \n \n9. Where We Are \n \nIn the previous sections we have described the present situation in the various branches that, \nall together, compose the art of spectral wave modelling. We can look at this overview with \ntwo different approaches. On one hand we can be pleased with what has been achieved. After \nall, the bias and scatter index of an operational global wave model, e.g. at the European \nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Reading, U.K.), are an impressive 4% and 0.11 \n(statistics of the first four months of 2006), and even better results are occasionally achieved \nby local scale modelling. Indeed, on the background of these results stand the substantial \nimprovements in the definition of the surface wind fields. Nevertheless, if for a moment we \ndetach ourselves from our daily habit, it is a sort of a marvel that we can anticipate the wave \nconditions in any part of the globe a few days in advance. However, as scientists we like and \nmust also be critical with our results and look always forward  to the next steps ahead. If we \ndo so, we realise that there is still plenty to do. Although we are able to evaluate with good \naccuracy the integral properties of the sea (significant wave height, period and direction), our \nresults are definitely less impressive once we look at the shape of the one- and, more so, two-\ndimensional spectra. Peaks and extreme conditions are frequently not well reproduced, and \nnot only because in these cases the meteorological input is not good enough. The point is that \nin such conditions the validity of the physical assumptions we have more or less consciously \nabsorbed in our theories are often stretched to their limits. Imbedded in our models there is \nstill a substantial degree of empiricism, that unavoidably is due to fail at a more or less large \ndegree once we act out of the usual range of conditions. Clearly a critical review is required, \nand this is what we have tried to achieve with this paper. It is worthwhile to summarise where \nwe stand in the single subjects we have described. \nThe generation by wind is an extremely complex process. We deal with the highly nonlinear \ninteraction of two fluids whose densities differ by three orders of magnitude. This implies a \nmulti-phenomenological behaviour at the interface, more or less complex as the difference of \nspeeds in the two layers increases. Also, direct visual observation is of little help, providing \nevidence of the integral results rather than of the mechanism by which energy is transferred \nfrom one fluid to the other one. Nevertheless, using some simplifying assumptions,  quite a bit \nof physical intuition and devoted measurements we have been able to formulate some basic \ntheory that indeed, once applied to the models, provides rather good results. \nOn the other hand the very fact that two of the most popular models, WAM and \nWAVEWATCH, operational at two of the most prominent meteorological centres, use \ndifferent approaches to the problem is in itself an indication that a single \u201cbest\u201d solution has \nnot yet been accepted. \nIn the present theories the very hypothesis of linearity, i.e. to consider the sea as a \nsuperposition  of sinusoidal components, should at least be open to doubts. An immediate \nexample is the skewness of a stormy surface, by definition not considered in the standard \nspectral wave models. This is likely to have an effect on generation, whose process, like \nwhite-capping, is not so smooth in space and time as the theories imply. Whoever has been at \nsea in the middle of a storm is led to question the hypothesis of linearity. Of course this can be \nsaid for all the processes where the hypothesis has been used, but generation by wind is the \nonly one where at present the modelled energy input at certain frequency and direction does \nnot depend on the contemporary situation at the other components. \nOf course this makes even more noticeable the results achieved till now, and it is a good proof \nof the ingenuity and brilliant hypotheses that stand at the base of the present theories. Indeed \nthe very fact that with a theory based on the linear hypothesis we manage to achieve good \nresults should in itself be a valuable piece of information. \nFor nonlinear interactions in deep water the basic problem seems to be the practical \nimplementation of an already well established theory. The struggle between the sheer volume \nof calculations implied by the theory and the practical possibilities of the present computers \nhas been dominating the stage for a long while. The capability of routinely carrying out full \nexact computations is still far away. The present efforts aim at developing new methods \n(MDIA, neural, diffusion), while exploiting the ever increasing computer power, reducing the \nnecessary time within manageable limits. These calculations are always compromises, and \nusually this appears as undesirable characteristics of the final results. Each one of the newly \nproposed methods has its own limitations, often still to be explored. \nNotwithstanding its sound theoretical definition more than forty years ago, the subject is still \ncharacterised by an active development. The full properties of the kinetic equation are still to \nbe explored. One first brilliant example of recent developments is the evaluation of the \nprobability of freak waves starting from the modelled spectra, in so doing correcting as a \nfollowing step the limitations on the skewness of the sea surface we pointed out above. \nAnother similarly valuable example has been to show that the nonlinear interactions lead to a \nbimodal spectrum also in anisotropic conditions. In particular the considerations of the quasi-\nresonant interactions seems to be a promising field of research. \nThe number of different approaches and proposed new solutions to the calculation of \nnonlinear interactions suggests that an intercomparison exercise, both in idealised and \npractical conditions, is required. This will help to define in a comparative way the \ncharacteristics and the capabilities of the single approaches. \nThe dissipation of wind waves in deep water is by definition the source term we know less. \nThere is hardly any agreement neither on the basic physics of the process nor on the best way, \nalthough empirical, to model it. We find worthwhile to repeat here two paragraphs of section \n4 related to the physical knowledge of the process: \n \n\u201cTo summarize this brief overview of existing theories of spectral dissipation, \nwe find several studies which offer four different analytical models. None of the \nmodels deals with the dynamics of wave breaking, which is responsible for \ndissipation. Rather, they suggest hypotheses to interpret either pre-breaking or \npost-breaking wave field properties. All of the hypotheses lack experimental \nsupport or validation. Results vary from the dissipation being a linear function of \nthe wave spectrum to the dissipation being quadratic, cubic or even a function of \nthe spectrum to the fifth power. \u201c \n \n\u201cTo conclude the review, we have to summarize that 1) there is no consensus \namong analytical theories of the spectral dissipation of wave energy due to wave \nbreaking, even with respect to the basic characteristics of the dissipation \nfunction, 2) the theoretical dissipation functions strongly disagree with the \nexperiment, and 3) experimental results, even though exhibit some common \nfeatures, are often in serious disagreement with each other. Such a state of \nknowledge of physics of the wave breaking losses does not help modelling the \nwave dissipation which has been drifting in its own way.\u201d \n \nThis could be a rather discouraging situation and shows how much there is still to be done in \nthis subject. On the other hand this has stimulated quite a bit of basic research in the recent \nyears. However, the results of this research have still to find their way into the operational \nmodels that, as just quoted, given the theoretical situation have been mostly drifting in their \nown way. Indeed, given the relative level of knowledge, spectral dissipation has been for a \nlong while, and still is, the tuning knob of the numerical wave models to make them fit at \nleast the wave integral properties (significant wave height, period, direction). \nAttempts to reproduce more integral properties of the wave field, e.g. the characteristics of the \nspectra, have recently led to various lines of research. In particular it has been made clear that \nany pre-assumption of the spectral shape, like the power law of the high frequency tail, is \nbound to make sooner or later the solution diverge from the truth. This has led to more \nfundamental approaches that have yet to find their way into operational models. \nNonlinear interactions in shallow water are characterised by the relevance of the third-order \nones. Dealing with interactions, not only in resonant, but also in near-resonant conditions, is \ntoday an active field of research, and the associated wave modelling activity has different \nlines of attack in this respect.  \nWhile the spectral approach is the undebated approach in the open oceans, close to shore, \nwhere changes can take place at a high rate and the degree of nonlinearity may jump at high \nlevels, the deterministic approach would appear as the natural solution. For the time being the \nobvious limit of the required computer power makes this approach suitable for short distances \n(a limited number of wavelengths). However, a practical problem is also the connection with \nthe offshore, spectrally modelled, wave conditions, from which different realisations of the \nboundary conditions can be similarly considered and need to be modelled if a suitable \nstatistics is to be derived. This is presently off-limits, even at the level of devoted \nexperiments. However, an efficient alternative is given by the (complex) amplitude evolution \nor spectral models, usually run in frequency space. \nA third alternative is offered by the stochastic approach, derived from deterministic equations \nand ensemble averaging. Most models limit the derived hierarchy of equations to two coupled \nequations for spectrum and bi-spectrum. This solution is attractive, because it allows the \ndirect computation of statistical quantities without the need for Montecarlo simulations. The \nmodel can be initialised with standard spectra (buoys or offshore spectral models), while the \nbi-spectrum is derived from second order theory. \nWhile there is a tendency to push the operational large scale spectral models towards the \nshore, it is necessary to point out that some of the solutions present in these models are still \nrather crude, especially when compared to the phase resolving and complex amplitude \nmodels. A strong obstacle is given by the lack of sound physical approaches on how to handle \ndissipation, particularly the depth induced one, so relevant in shallow water. We still do not \nknow how to distribute the energy loss throughout the spectrum. Also, we should not forget \nthat most of the calculations with the nonlinear models mentioned above have been carried \nout on very simplified, regular bathymetries. Any operational application in real conditions is \nmuch more problematic. \nDissipation associated to the interaction of waves with the bottom is another subject where we \nstill have a lot to learn. The problem is associated with two basic characteristics of what is \ngoing on: the number of contemporary and alternative bottom mechanisms that can be active \nto dissipate the wave energy, and the difficulty of analysing and measuring a process while it \nis active. As a matter of fact practically all the data we have concern the measurements  of \nwave characteristics at different progressive locations, in so doing providing information only \non the integrated effect of the process, rather than on the physics and its details. Somehow we \ncan also think to be more sensitive in our observations, hence more speculative, to surface \nbreaking, simply because of its visibility, while of bottom dissipation we have only a \nperception of its consequences. In general we can say we have a fair idea of the physics \ninvolved, but we lack a solid quantification of the energy lost in the process. Related model \ndata, estimated to be off by an order of magnitude, are not unknown. \nThere are practical difficulties. On one hand also the integrated characteristics of the surface \nare not always purely indicative of the bottom dissipation processes, simply because there are \noften other, not necessarily bottom, processes at work, e.g. generation by wind and white-\ncapping. On the other hand the true characteristics of the bottom are mostly unknown \n(dimensions of the ripples, sheet flow, etc.) or, at best, modelled only with large \napproximations, and they can easily change the estimate of the derived energy loss of an order \nof magnitude. \nAlso the physics of the influence of a current on bottom dissipation is not fully understood. \nThe intuition suggests that, when contemporarily present, both losses, those due to waves and \nto current, should be enhanced. However, the evidence is not clear, notwithstanding the \nrelevance of the subject for storm surge modelling and the evaluation of wave and current \nconditions in tidal inlets. \nFor practical and operational applications a serious problem is given by the sub-grid \nvariability. Particularly close to shore this can be quite high, and average conditions over one \ngrid step are not granted to provide the correct integral over its extent. \nNotwithstanding this rather pessimistic panorama, bottom dissipation, mostly represented by \nthe bottom friction process, is regularly considered in shallow water modelling. The point is \nthat, with the exception of particular conditions as the Southern North Sea or a long swell on \noceanic coastlines with an extended continental shelf, bottom friction is rarely the dominant \nprocess for the proper evaluation of the wave conditions at a given location. Of course this \ndoes not cancel the need for a deepening of the subject. \nAlthough non-dissipative, bottom scattering, discussed also in section 7, has a more positive \nsituation, at least from the theoretical point of view. The interaction of the surface spectrum \nwith the geometrical characteristics of the bottom is relatively well understood. In recent \ntimes also the effects of single perturbations of the bottom, like a single step, have been dealt \nwith mathematically. While the laboratory results support these approaches, confirmation \nfrom the field seems more difficult to obtain. \nWave propagation addresses the problem of waves propagating on an uneven bottom or \nacross a non-uniform and time varying current. Most of the present models rely on the \nvalidity of the linear theory, using the classical linear dispersion relationship to relate \nfrequency and wavenumber. Also the Earth rotation has a limited influence, and waves \npropagate with very good approximation along great circles that, on limited distances, \ncoincide at all the effects with straight lines. \nIf depth and current change over distances much larger than the considered wavelength, the \nusual geometrical optical approximation is quite robust. Expectably complications arise when \nthe changes take place over distances comparable with the wavelength. In phase-averaged \nmodels these discontinuities are usually treated introducing frequency dependent reflection \ncoefficients at the proper locations and directions, providing quite reasonable results. More in \ngeneral the interaction of the surface waves and the bottom elevation spectra implies a \nconservative scattering of the surface waves. This process is still not yet included in most \nwave models because a proper theory has only been given recently, and practical methods for \nits calculation are still to be defined when only little information is available on the bottom \nspectra. \nThe same approach used for wave-bottom conservative interactions is usable also for currents. \nHere too the level of interaction depends on the amplitude and the spatial scale of the current \nvariations. The modifications of waves when interacting with current are not interesting only \non themselves, but also for remote sensing, both from space and from coastal water. A strong \nlimitations to the operational implementation of the extensive theory available is the lack of \nsufficiently accurate description of the current field in the open sea. While improvements are \nexpected in the near future, in practice for the time being the only interactions with currents  \nthat receive sufficient attention in operational models are the ones with tidal currents. \nIn any case all these approaches are generally applied with the current assumed to be uniform \non the vertical. This is not always the case, but the implications are not considered in standard \nwave modelling. While the problem is probably limited for large scale currents, the Stokes \ndrift is expected to have a non-negligible impact on shorter waves.  \nWith respects to the other subjects, numerics has the big advantage of being perfectly defined, \nand suitable for an analysis of the practical results with respect to the ones expected from \ntheory. This does not make the problem simpler, but at least we can have a clear idea of where \nwe are. Of course the problem is associated to the discretisation with which we describe an \notherwise continuous nature. This implies some approximations, as for instance in the \ndescription of the peak of the spectrum (frequency resolution) or in the characterisation of the \nbottom profile (spatial resolution). More seriously, it implies a modification of the signal \nwhile it propagates, theoretically undisturbed, across the grid. The approaches to this problem \nare different, depending if we deal with advection, both in lat-lon and in spectral space, or \nwith the description of the spectra and the geography of the area. \nIn the case of advection, the problem is well understood and a whole hierarchy of approaches \nhas been proposed. Indeed it is remarkable that a \u201cbest solution\u201d is not universally adopted. \nClearly this points to the fact that in a certain environment any practical solution, besides \nbeing linked to historical reasons, is always a compromise between several requirements. One \npeculiar fact of these compromises is the apparent compensation introduced by the signal \ndiffusion for the patchy distribution due to the Garden Sprinkler effect. Although criticised, \nthe solution has certainly served its purpose. Higher order advection schemes, paralleled by a \ncontrolled diffusion algorithm, are presently available, although the opinions on which one is \npreferable are certainly not uniform. \nA correct geography is just a matter of resolution, and implicitly of computer power, because \nthe system of differential equations must be solved at each grid point at each time step. The \ncombination of these two needs makes the overall computer power to grow as 1\/\u03943, where \u0394 \nis the geographical resolution. A substantial problem are the sub-grid characteristics of the \narea of interest, typically small islands not represented in the computational grid. In this case \nthe solution is a transparency coefficient, calculated from a much higher resolution bottom \ntopography, for each point of the grid and for each component of the spectrum. \nThe natural solution to the general problem is to use a variable grid resolution, typically more \ncoarse in the large ocean spaces, and highly defined close to the coasts. This can be achieved \neither with nested modelling or with unstructured grids. This latter solution has never been \nvery popular in wave modelling, but it is rapidly gaining ground, particularly for dealing with \nan optimised resolution with coastal and inner areas with a complicated bathymetry. \nThe discretisation in space is reflected also in time, and the step integration of the set of \nequations at the base of a model has its implications. With the traditional Eulerian approach \nthe time step is upper limited by the grid step size due to either stability or accuracy. In some \nmodels the introduction of a semi-Lagrangian advection has somehow relaxed this conditions, \nbut attention must be given to the physics of the processes. In particular the use of the same \u0394t \nfor all the frequencies can be questionable, leading to the use of a suitable, but artificial, limits \nto the changes during each integration step. Notable progresses have been made in this respect \nin recent times. \nThis compact summary, and more in general the material presented in the previous sections, \npoints to the extensive effort that is still going on in wave modelling. This is due to two \ncharacteristics not easily found in other subjects. On one hand we deal with a very complex \nphysical process where physics, from fundamental principles till very practical problems, \nplays a dominant role. On the other hand the subject is highly in demand for its very wide \napplications, with a continuous push by the market forces to improve the quality of the \nresults. \nSince the first order approximation of the historical SMB method (Sverdrup and Munk, \n1946), we have well achieved the next step, with much reduced bias and r.m.s. errors of the \nintegral parameters, particularly off the coasts. What is next? We expect to decrease further \nthe above errors. This can be achieved refining the formulation of the single processes \nfollowing the various approaches described in the various sections, improving the numerics, \nand, still critical, although not so much as in the past, improving the input wind fields. \nHowever, the real task is to ameliorate the quality of the spectra. Although not yet strongly \nrequired by the market, their use in practical applications is growing and the present \nlimitations of spectral wave modelling in this respect are beginning to be felt. It is not only a \nmatter of users. To improve the quality of the spectra will allow a better description of some \nphysical processes that depend so much on their details. \nA substantial question concerns the high frequency tail of the spectrum, presently \nparameterised in a not yet agreed way, notwithstanding its relevance in the overall physics \nand for practical applications, e.g. remote sensing and coupling with meteorological models. \nNotwithstanding the good average results of a wave model, at least as integral parameters, a \nstill missing points is the physics, hence modelling, of extreme conditions. We still are not \nsure of the processes that are taking place and of the resolution required for their \nrepresentation. The difficulties cannot be underestimated, also because the corresponding \nlaboratory results provide only limited replies. However, the recent events and our growing \ninteraction with the sea are clearly pushing towards a better understanding of what is going on \nin these conditions. \nClearly an area where action is required is the interaction between waves and currents. At the \nsimplest level of a vertically uniform current field, improvements are expected in a relatively \nshort while from global circulation models. However, this will concern the general features of \na field. Somehow this is similar to the argument on the tail of a wave spectrum mentioned \nabove. Both because of a lack of information  and of the present limits of the circulation \nmodels, the representation of the details of the fields is rather approximate. However, this is \nstill a scale capable to affect the wave fields at an appreciable level. \nThe difficulty of the problem steps up once we consider the currents as three-dimensional. \nParticularly, but not only, in coastal areas this can indeed be the case. Even assuming we \nknow the details of the current field, the know-how of how to deal with this problem is not yet \na granted background of the wave modelling community. \nSo our feeling is a mixture of satisfaction for the results achieved so far and of realisation of \nour present limitations and the need to go further. Some of the areas where to act are quite \nclear, other ones are more foggy. The next and final section will deal, although also in a \nspeculative way, with this last point. \n \n10. Where to Go \n \nHaving stated where we are and the obvious problems to face in the immediate future, we \nneed to think in longer terms and argue about the strategy for the future. A forecast in a still \npartly unknown territory is always a hard bet, but it is worthwhile to try, at least to quantify \nthe problem. Cavaleri (2006) argues about the far future of wave modelling. Here we concern \nourselves with more immediate developments. \nIn the introduction we had mentioned that, just because we are acting at the far front of \nresearch, our opinions are often not uniform. We had also pointed out that this a is a necessary \nand favourable condition to go further, simply because we do not know in advance which will \nbe the winning strategy. Expectably, the spectrum of opinions widens in a nonlinear way the \nfurther we speculate on the future. Therefore this section represents in some cases some \nobvious requirements and expectations, in other cases ideas floating around with a different \nlevel of agreement. Perhaps this is the most exciting part of our work. \nClearly our field is highly variegated. We have different branches where we act with different \nlevels of confidence, and where the physics and the possible paths for the future are known \nwith a similarly variable degree of uncertainty. Some of the problems are technical, other ones \nare physical, so it is not possible to give a single general statement. Rather, we can touch \nseveral points in sequence. \nWe begin with the generation by wind. All the present approaches stand on the spectral \nhypothesis, i.e. the sea is conceived as a superposition of sinusoids, and we estimate the input \nto each component on the base of the, although modified, Miles\u2019s theory. This approach has \nbeen very successful, but the view of a stormy sea hardly suggests this idea. Already thirty \nyears ago Banner and Melville (1976) have shown that the input by wind to waves  is not the \nsmooth continuous process implies by the Miles\u2019s approach. Rather, it is highly \ndiscontinuous, with strong bursts of momentum and energy transfer. The point is that we do \nnot know how to deal with such a process. However, this should not make us hide the fact that \nour present approach, albeit successful, is not a faithful representation of what is going on the \nsea. How to deviate from our present path is an open question, but sooner or later something \nwill have to be done. \nThe work by Banner and Melville (1976)  has shown the clear link in an active young sea \nbetween generation and white-capping dissipation. While for the time being they are \nindependently evaluated, it is a real possibility that at some stage they will have to be \nconsidered as a single process. However, this is not for the near future. For the time being a \nmore physical description of white-capping is highly in demand. There are indications that the \ncareful analysis of the available experimental data is opening doors in this direction. In any \ncase the move must clearly be from empirism towards the physics. \nRemaining in the physical realm, the bottom dissipation processes are a real challenge, \nperhaps not so much for their physics that, at least in the first approximation, is relatively \nunderstood. The problem is the availability of the information  (the characteristics of the \nbottom) required for their correct evaluation. Within the relevance of the process for the \nevaluation of the wave conditions at a certain location, a detailed knowledge of the bottom \ncharacteristics of the area is a mandatory condition. This will also help to decide which \nprocesses can be locally relevant and it is therefore worthwhile, if not all of them, to consider. \nHowever, granted this information, the correct quantification of the energy involved in the \nprocesses is still a problem, as their physics itself implies that small changes of the wave \nconditions can lead to an order of magnitude difference of the involved energy budget. How \nto deal with this problem is still an open question. \nAlso, quite a bit of physics is still to be clarified. Although limited to some special areas, the \nanelastic motion of a viscous muddy bottom is not properly understood, especially in \nconnection with the dissipation of also relatively high frequencies. The relevance for \nhurricane affected areas as the Gulf of Mexico or the Bay of Bengal is evident. This requires \nsome devoted measurements and physical intuition. \nIt can be surprising, but, at a second thought, instructive, that nonlinear interactions, the most \npurely physical process we deal with, is theoretically the best known. The sheer complexity \nhas its revenge in the present practical impossibility  of routinely evaluating the exact result. \nOf course in the long term we can expect the computer power  to keep growing, although \nperhaps not so rapidly as during the last thirty years. However, this will not be enough, and, \nas already discussed, compromise solutions need to and will be found. The question is how \naccurate we need to be to guide the evolution of the spectrum towards the correct results. \nSomehow this needs to be quantified through the already proposed intercomparison exercise. \nIn shallow water there seems to be more ground for not-only-numerical developments. \nSomehow the exploration of this area of research has begun in more recent times, and further \ndevelopments are needed and expected. The substantial gap of computer power required by \nphase resolving and phase averaging models leaves ample ground for intermediate solutions. \nConsidering spectra and bispectra is just an example in this direction, but quite a bit of \nactivity is expected for the future along this or similar lines of activity. Whichever the \nsolution adopted, it is clear that a higher resolution is required close to the coasts. The \ntendency for having a single model for the whole area of interest stresses the need for variable \nresolutions, with an expected increased use of unstructured grids. \nA stronger interaction between the wave and the circulation modelling community is a must \nand an expected development. It is not only a problem of operational applications, but also of \nphysics of both the models. For applications, we have the mentioned need of a better \ndescription of the current fields to properly evaluate their effect on the wave  field. \nConversely, there is also the effect of waves on the current. Similarly for what done for the \ncoupling with the atmosphere, we need a two-way coupling between wave and circulation \nmodels. There are various aspects open to findings. Perhaps the most macroscopic one is the \ndriving of circulation by wind. While this is presently done using the wind stresses, the flow \nof energy and momentum wind \u2192 waves \u2192 breaking \u2192 circulation needs to be considered as \nthe real driving mechanism. \nThe increased coastal resolution mentioned above needs to be considered also as regards the \npropagation on an uneven bottom. Apart from the technical aspects with which the \nirregularities of the bottom profile can be dealt with, clearly these features need to be \nresolved. While intuitively we associate an increasing resolution to the approach to the \ncoastline, we can certainly think of using it also on required isolated spots. \nFinally, concerning numerics, improvements are expected in two directions. On one hand we \nneed more efficient and accurate algorithms, both for advection and for time integration. \nSome improvements are expected, although apparently the clear definition and limits of the \nproblem leaves a limited ground for manoeuvre. Possibly a stronger improvement will come \nfrom the combined use of Eulerian and Lagrangean advection techniques, both in open and \ncoastal waters. \nHaving discussed how to improve the modelling of the single processes and what we expect \nfor the near future, we need to ask ourselves a basic question. Even assuming that all the \nrepresentations of the single processes are improved with respect to their present state of the \nart, can we assume that this will produce better overall results with respect to the present \nperformances? The point we should not hide is that in the present models , although they are \ndeclared as purely physical, there is quite a bit of tuning and artifices to make them fit the \nmeasured data. This happens at different parts of the models and with different strategies, but \nit is there. We have mentioned that white-capping, just because it is the least known process, \nis often used as a tuning knob to best-fit the results and measurements. Given this situation, \nwhat can we expect once each process is independently described at its best, even improved, \nlevel of knowledge? Most likely, if not certainly, the results will be worse than the present \nones, at least at the beginning. With progressive improvements we will move ahead of the \npresent performance. However, most likely also in the longer term new \u201coptimised\u201d models \nwill continuously branch out of the main line of development, improving for the time being \nthe overall performance. \nShould we refrain from acting in this direction? Certainly not, because we must keep in mind \nthe duty of practical applications. While we develop our models towards the best and most \nphysical solution, we have also to provide continuously the best possible results to the users. \nSo somehow we have to live with this dichotomy that we recognise also in the present large \nscale operational models, where we find different level of pragmatism depending on where \none institution puts the focus for its results. \nHow to conclude? Many doors are open, and work will be done in many directions. Some are \nknown or expected, in other cases we look for new ones. However, one general idea is clear. \nWhatever we do, we have to move towards a more fundamental coupling between the sea and \nthe atmosphere. The meteorological models must interact continuously with the ocean \ncirculation models, not through empirical formulations, but through the physically sound \ninterface  of a wave model, acting as the element that determines how the exchanges take \nplace and their extent. This is how nature works, and this is how we have to represent it if we \naim at a better understanding and modelling of the thin layer of fluid that surrounds our \nbeautiful planet. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe knowledge of a branch of science by a specific group of researchers unavoidably derives \nalso from the many persons with whom, in a direct or non-direct way, they have interacted.

The interaction diagram in the wave number plane showing interacting wave \nnumber vectors satisfying the resonance conditions (3.1) and (3.2) for the deep-\nwater case. This figure is often referred to as the \u201cFigure of Eight\u201d diagram, after \nPhillips (1960). \n \nFigure 3.2. Test wave spectrum corresponding to case 3 of Hasselmann and Hasselmann \n(1981). Left panel: directional variance spectrum F(f,\u001f) (due to symmetry, only \none quarter of the frequency-direction plane is considered). Right panel: \nfrequency spectrum E(f) obtained by integration of F(f,\u001f) over wave directions. \n \nFigure 3.3. Nonlinear transfer term Qnl4(f,\u001f) computed for the test wave spectrum of Figure \n3.2 in deep water (due to symmetry, only one quarter of the frequency-direction \nplane is considered). Upper panel: WRT exact method. Lower panel: DIA. \n \nFigure 3.4. Nonlinear transfer term Qnl4(f) computed for the test wave spectrum of Figure 3.2 \nin deep water. These curves are obtained by integration of the terms Qnl4 (f,\u001f) of \nFigure 3.3 over wave directions. \n"}
