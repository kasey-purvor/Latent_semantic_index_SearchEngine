Introduction.\nThis paper attempts to apply the concept of cumulative count of conforming chart\n(CCC chart) to monitor a system with three states.\nStatistical process control is a widely used tool in the industry for process monitoring.\nVery commonly, control charts are merely used for the purpose of \u201cfire fighting\u201d for\nremoval of assignable causes each time when the process parameter has shifted. However,\noccurrence of assignable causes can sometimes be the result of gradual deterioration of\nTypeset by AMS-TEX\n1\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nthe system such as aging of parts. Thus, signals on the control charts may be used\nas indications of whether inspection or maintenance of the system should be carried\nout, rather than just the state of fitness of the process. Tagaras and Lee (1988) and\nTagaras(1998) separated the X\u00af-chart into several zones and optimized the chart for\nmonitoring a process whose deterioration can be classified into two states in which one\nstate requires minor restoration and the other requires major restoration, and considered\neconomic design of the control chart. Cassady et al (2000) considered economic design of\ncontrol charts for optimization of preventive maintenance policies for systems. See also\nPage (1955), Weindling et al (1970), Gordon and Weindling (1975), Montgomery (1980),\nChan et al (2000), Montgomery (2001), Chan et al (2002), Chan (2003), Liao et al (2006)\nfor related work.\nIn what follows, we shall assume that as production continues, the production system\nwill deteriorate from its normal state to a state that requires minor maintenance, and if\nminor maintenance is not carried out the system will eventually deteriorate to a state that\nrequires major maintenance. We shall use the CCC chart defined based on the geometric\ndistribution to develop inspection and maintenance policies for a production system in\nwhich each item produced can be classified as either conforming or nonconforming. The\nCCC chart, first introduced by Calvin (1983), further developed by Goh (1987), and\nextended by and Ranjan et al (2003), is an alternative to the classical np- and p-charts\nthat have serious drawbacks when the process nonconforming rate is low (Calvin(1983),\nLucas(1989), Chan (2000), and Chan et al (1997)). The CCC chart can be used effectively\nfor monitoring high-quality processes in which the fraction of nonconforming is low, even\nas low as at the level of ppm (parts per million) or ppb (parts per billion).\n2. The states and investigations of a system\n2\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nWe consider process monitoring and maintenance of a system in which the fraction of\nnonconforming items produced is p \u2208 (0, 1), and all items are inspected. The number of\nitems inspected, n, until a nonconforming item is observed, is a geometric random variable\nwith the following probability function f(n) and cumulative distribution function F (n):\nf(n) = p(1\u2212 p)n\u22121, F (n) = 1\u2212 (1\u2212 p)n (n = 1, 2, ...). (2.1)\nIn monitoring such a system using the CCC chart, control limits are obtained from F (n)\nat p = p0, and an observed value of n falling beyond the control limits is a signal for out\nof control which indicates possible shift of p from its target value p0.\nAssume that the system has three states, the normal state S0 with nonconforming\nfraction p = p0 > 0, the slightly deteriorated state S1 with p = p1 > p0, and the seriously\ndeteriorated state S2 with p = p2 > p1. (Throughout this paper we shall use S0, S1,\nS2 with Roman type \u201cS\u201d to denote the states of a system, while S1, S2 with italic \u201cS\u201d\nwill be reserved to represent mathematical quantities. Likewise, in what follows, m\u03b3 ,\nM\u03b3 , i\u03b3 , I\u03b3 and s\u03b3 (\u03b3 = 0, 1, 2 or 1 + 2) with Roman type \u201cm\u201d, \u201cM\u201d, \u201ci\u201d, \u201cI\u201d and \u201cs\u201d\nwill be used to denote \u201cmaintenance\u201d, \u201cinspection\u201d and \u201csignal\u201d as appropriate, while\nm, i, s in italic (with or without subscript) will be reserved to represent mathematical\nquantities.) Suppose that two grades of maintenance actions, minor maintenance m1\nand major maintenance m2 are available, where m1 is less thorough than m2 but is less\ncostly. For notational convenience, from time to time we shall use m0 to mean that no\nmaintenance action will be carried out. Based on practical consideration, we assume the\nfollowing:\n1. No maintenance is required for S0, and when the system is in S0 neither m1 nor m2\nwill change its state.\n2. When the system is in S0, it will deteriorate to S1 with probability \u03c001 > 0, imme-\n3\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \ndiately before an item is produced.\n3. Either m1 or m2 can bring the system from S1 back to S0.\n4. When the system is in S1, it will deteriorate to S2 with probability \u03c012 > 0, imme-\ndiately before an item is produced.\n5. m1 has no effect on S2, but m2 can bring the system from S2 to S0.\n6. The system will not deteriorate from S0 to S2 directly without passing through S1.\n7. Complete failure (that is, malfunctioning) of the system does not occur, even though\nas the system deteriorates from S0 to S1 and then to S2, the nonconforming fraction\np increases.\nSuppose that n1 > n2 > 0. Divide the set of all positive integers Z+ into the\nfollowing three sets:\nZ0 = {n \u2208 Z+ : n1 + 1 \u2264 n <\u221e},\nZ1 = {n \u2208 Z+ : n2 + 1 \u2264 n \u2264 n1},\nZ2 = {n \u2208 Z+ : 1 \u2264 n \u2264 n2}.\nIf a nonconforming item is observed at n \u2208 Z\u03b3 (\u03b3 = 0, 1, 2), a type \u03b3 signal s\u03b3 is said\nto have occurred. When s0 has occurred, no inspection of the system will be carried out,\nand inspection will be carried out when s1 or s2 has occurred. When the system is in S0,\nwe expect that s0 will occur most of the time, and thus s0 is regarded as an indication\nthat the system is in its normal state S0. As the system deteriorates (p increases), the\nchance for s1 to occur increases. When the system is in S2, we expect that s2 will occur\nmost of the time, and thus we regard s2 as an indication that the system is in the most\ndeteriorated state S2. However, any of s0, s1, s2 may occur when the system is in S0, S1 or\nS2. Thus, when the system is in S0, signal s1 or s2 (which indicates system deterioration)\nmay be regarded as \u201cType I error\u201d, and when the system is in S2, signal s0 or s0 (which\n4\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nindicates that the system is in state S0 or S1) may be regarded as \u201cType II error\u201d. In\nSection 6, we shall take into account such errors in economic design of inspection and\nmaintenance policies where expressions for the expected numbers of s\u03b3(\u03b3 = 0, 1, 2) when\nthe system is S0, S1 or S2 will be required, and such expressions will be given in Section\n5.\nSuppose that two types of inspection, minor inspection i1 and major inspection\ni2, are available, where i1 is not as thorough as i2 but is less costly. For notational\nconvenience, from time to time we shall use i0 to mean that no investigation will be\ncarried out. When the system is in S0 or S1, both i1 and i2 will correctly reveal the true\nstate of the system, but when the system is in S2, i1 will incorrectly indicate that the\nsystem is in S1 and only i2 will correctly reveal that the system is in S2.\nFrom the economic of view, whether to carry out inspection depends on the inspec-\ntion cost relative to the maintenance cost, and to the penalty of wrong indication of the\nstate of the system. Consider the following three inspection arrangements, I1+2, I2, I0,\nand three maintenance arrangements M1+2, M2, M0.\nI1+2 \u2014 Both i1 and i2 are employed. When s\u03b3 occurs, i\u03b3 will be carried out (\u03b3 = 1, 2).\nI2 \u2014 Only i2 is employed. When either s1 or s2 occurs, i2 will be carried out.\nI0 \u2014 Neither i1 nor i2 will be employed. When s1 or s2 occurs, maintenance work\nwill be carried out without first inspecting the system.\nM1+2 \u2014 Both m1 and m2 are employed.\nM2 \u2014 Only m2 is employed.\nM0 \u2014 Neither m1 nor m2 is employed. That is, no maintenance work will be carried out.\nThe above concepts on states of the system and types of inspection and maintenance\nare illustrated by the following real-life example in maintenance of buses in a bus com-\n5\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \npany. A dynamo supplies the power to a cooling fan in the cooling system of the engine.\nBy design, unfortunately this dynamo is installed near the engine with high temperature,\nand a cooling fan system called System C is designed for cooling the dynamo.\n(a) S0 is the state where System C is not blocked by dust and operates efficiently, and\nthe coolant will reach its boiling point with a small probability p0 > 0 at the end of\na day\u2019s operation.\n(b) Checking whether the coolant has reached it boiling point at the end of a day\u2019s\noperation is \u201cinspection of an item\u201d.\n(c) S1 is the state where System C is partially block by dust, so that the dynamo is\nover-heated and supplies insufficient electric current to drive the cooling fan, and\nas a result the probability for the coolant to reach its boiling point at the end of a\nday\u2019s operation will be p1 > p0.\n(d) After a day\u2019s operation in state S0, a bus will change to S1 with probability \u03c001 > 0.\n(e) Minor inspection i1 opens the chassis cover and inspects whether System C requires\ndust cleaning. Minor maintenance m1 removes the dust accumulated in System C.\nIf m1 is not performed, System C will be eventually blocked by dust resulting in\nover-heating and dynamo damage, which is state S2.\n(f) After a day\u2019s operation in state S1, a bus will change to S2 with probability \u03c012 > 0.\nIn state S2, there is a probability p2(> p1) for the coolant to reach its boiling point\nwhich could possibly result in engine damage.\n(g) Major inspection i2 disassembles System C and inspects whether the dynamo has\nbeen damaged due to over-heating, and major maintenance m2 is to replace the\ndynamo.\n(h) The values of p0, p1, p2, \u03c001, and \u03c012 depend on the bus route.\n(i) The costs for performing i1, i2, m1, and m2 depend on the model of the bus.\n6\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \n3. Cycle of operation for the system.\nA cycle of operation is said to be completed when the system starts at S0, deteriorates\nto S1 or S2, and then is restored back to S0 by m1 or m2.\nAccording to the framework of inspection and maintenance defined in Section 2,\nto study the system analytically we need to consider different scenarios for a cycle to\ncomplete as shown in Figure 1. The small circles, \u201c\u25e6\u2019s\u201d, denote nonconforming items\nthat either do not lead to any maintenance action or lead to a maintenance action that\ndoes not change the state of the system. The bullet, \u201c\u2022\u201d, denotes the last nonconforming\nitem in a cycle that leads to maintenance action that restores the system from states S1\nor S2 back to S0. Hence a cycle ends only after a bullet \u2022 has occured. Seven different\ncases (Case 0, ..., Case 6) are possible, and they are described below. A cycle may end\nunder either one of the six cases, Case 1, ..., or Case 6.\nN1\nS0 z }| { p0|\nCase 0. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 || {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1\nN1\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1\nCase 1. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j k\nN1 N2\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1 z}|{\nCase 2. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j k c1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 cN2+1\n7\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nN1 N2\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1 z }| { p1|p2 S2\nCase 3. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j k c1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 cN2 m n\nN1 N2 N3\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1 z }| { p1|p2 S2 z}|{\nCase 4. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |+ \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j k c1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 cN2 m n r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rN3+1\nN1\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1 p1 |p2 S2\nCase 5. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |\u2212 |+ \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j m n\nN1 N3\nS0 z }| { p0|p1 S1 p1 |p2 S2 z}|{\nCase 6. | \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 |\u2212 |+ \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022\u2192S0| {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z } | {z }\ni1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iN1 j m n r1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 rN3+1\nFigure 1. Occurrence of nonconforming items.\nCase 0. While the system is in S0, N1(\u2265 0) nonconforming items \u25e6\u2019s have occurred. As\nthe system is in S0 and has not yet changed to S1, no maintenance action is necessary,\nthere is no bullet \u2022 in the figure, and a cycle has not yet been formed. The figure shows\nthat before a nonconforming item \u25e6 occurs, iu \u2212 1 (u = 1, ...,N1) conforming items are\nproduced.\nCase 1. While the system is in S0, N1(\u2265 0) nonconforming items \u25e6\u2019s have occurred.\nNext, another j \u2212 1 conforming items have also occurred which is followed by changing\n8\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nof the system from S0 to S1, and then the jth item occurs. Immediately after the system\nhas changed from S0 to S1, k + 1(\u2265 1) items are produced, where the first k of these\nk + 1 items are conforming items but the last one is a \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d represents\nthe first item produced immediately after the system has changed to S1, where this item\nis a conforming item if k > 0, and is a nonconforming item \u2022 if k = 0.\nCase 2. This case represents the situation when the last nonconforming item in Case\n1 is not a \u2022 but a \u25e6. In this case, when the system is in S1, N2 + 1(\u2265 1) \u25e6\u2019s occur\nbefore the \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d represents a conforming item if k > 0 and represents a\nnonconforming item \u25e6 if k = 0. The figure shows that when the system is in S1, cu\u22121(\u2265 0)\n(u = 1, ..., N2+1) items are produced before each of the last N2+1 nonconforming items.\nCase 3. This case represents the situation when the last nonconforming item in Case 2\nis not a \u2022 but a \u25e6. In this case, when the system is in S1, N2+1(\u2265 1) \u25e6\u2019s have occurred.\nNext, another m \u2212 1 conforming items have occurred which is followed by changing of\nthe system from S1 to S2, and then the mth item occurs. Immediately after the system\nhas changed from S1 to S2, n+1(\u2265 1) items are produced, where the first n of these n+1\nitems are conforming items but the last one is a \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d above the embrace\nof \u201cm\u201d represents the first item produced immediately after the system has changed to\nS2, where this item is a conforming item if n > 0 and is a nonconforming item \u2022 if n = 0.\nCase 4. This case represents the situation when the last nonconforming item in Case 3\nis not a \u2022 but a \u25e6. In this case, immediately after the system has changed from S1 to S2,\nN3 + 1(\u2265 1) \u25e6\u2019s have occurred before the bullet \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d above the embrace\nof \u201cm\u201d represents a conforming item if n > 0 and represents a nonconforming item \u25e6 if\nn = 0. The figure shows that when the system is in S2, ru \u2212 1(\u2265 0) (u = 1, ..., N3 + 1)\n9\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nconforming items are produced before each of the last N3 + 1 nonconforming items.\nIn Cases 5 and 6, no nonconforming item occurs when the system is in S1, and the\nbar \u201c\u2212\u201d denotes a conforming item.\nCase 5. While the system is in S0, N1(\u2265 0) nonconforming items \u25e6\u2019s have occurred.\nNext, another j\u22121 conforming items have occurred which is followed by changing of the\nsystem from S0 to S1, and then the jth item occurs which is a conforming one. When\nthe system is in S1, all the m items produced are conforming. Immediately after the\nsystem has changed from S1 to S2, n + 1(\u2265 1) items are produced, where the first n of\nthese n+ 1 items are conforming but the last one is a \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d represents a\nconforming item if n > 0, and represents the \u2022 if n = 0.\nCase 6. This the case represents the situation when the last nonconforming item in Case\n5 is not a \u2022 but a \u25e6. In this case, immediately after the system has changed from S1 to S2,\nN3 + 1(\u2265 1) \u25e6\u2019s have occurred before the bullet \u2022. The plus sign \u201c+\u201d above the embrace\nof \u201cm\u201d represents a conforming item if n > 0 and represents a nonconforming item \u25e6 if\nn = 0. The figure shows that when the system is in S2, ru \u2212 1(\u2265 0) (u = 1, ..., N3 + 1)\nconforming items are produced before each of the last N3 + 1 nonconforming items.\nBecause a nonconforming item can only show up as a circle \u25e6 or a bullet \u2022 but\nnot both, from the different positions of occurrences of the bullets \u2022\u2019s in Figure 1, it is\nnot difficult to see that Case 1, ..., Case 6 are mutually exclusive. These cases are also\nexhaustive for the system to complete a cycle, because a bullet \u2022 can occur only when\nthe system is in either stage S1 or S2, and Case 1, ..., Case 6 include all possible cases for\nthe bullet \u2022 to occur.

Based on these results, expected numbers of inspections and mainte-\nnance actions can be derived, and using these results optimal inspection and maintenance\nstrategies can be obtained in Section 7.\nConsider the inspection and maintenance model (I1+2,M1+2), where all of i1, i2, m1\nand m2 are employed. Under this model, when s\u03b3 (\u03b3 = 1, 2) appears, i\u03b3 will be carried\nout. If an inspection shows that the system is in S\u03b3 , m\u03b3 will be carried out (\u03b3 = 1, 2).\nWhen the system is in S0, the \u25e6\u2019s in Figure 1 may indicate s0, s1 or s2. When the system\nis in S1, the \u25e6\u2019s indicate s0, and the bullet \u2022 indicates either s1 or s2. When the system\nis in S2, the \u25e6\u2019s may indicate either s0 or s1, and the \u2022 indicates s2.\nIn what follows, for convenience we let \u03b20 = (1\u2212\u03c001)(1\u2212p0), \u03b21 = (1\u2212\u03c012)(1\u2212p1).\nIn Case 0, while the system remains in S0, the probability for (i\u22121) conforming items\noccurring followed by a nonconforming item \u25e6 is (1\u2212\u03c001)i(1\u2212p0)i\u22121p0 = \u03b2i\u221210 (1\u2212\u03c001)p0.\nThe total probability over the entire range of i is\nI. =I.;i =\n\u221eX\ni=1\n\u03b2i\u221210 (1\u2212 \u03c001)p0 =\n(1\u2212 \u03c001)p0\n1\u2212 \u03b20\n=\n\u00c3X\ni\u2208Z0\n+\nX\ni\u2208Z1\n+\nX\ni\u2208Z2\n!\n\u03b2i\u221210 (1\u2212 \u03c001)p0\n=I0;i + I1;i + I2;i = I0 + I1 + I2,\nwhere I0;i, I1;i, I2;i denote the last three summations, respectively, and for simplicity, we\nalso denote them by I0, I1, I2, respectively.

When the system is\nin S1, either i1 or i2 will indicate the true state of the system, and m1 will be carried\nout, while m2 will not be necessary.

This situation occurs when the costs of\ninvestigations i1 and i2 are nearly as high as the costs of maintenance m1 and m2, so\nthat it is economically not viable to carry out investigation.

Other models without minor investigation.\nWhen the cost of minor investigation i1 is nearly as high as i2, it will be economically\nviable to replace i1 by i2. When the costs of i1 and i2 are nearly as high as m1 and m2,\nit will be economically viable to replace i1 by m1 and replace i2 by m2. When the cost\nof m1 is nearly as high as m2, it will be economically viable to replace m1 by m2.\nUnder the models (I2,M1+2), (I2,M2) and (I0,M2), when the system is in S0, the \u25e6\u2019s\nin Figure 1 may indicate signals s0, s1 or s2. When the system is in S1, the \u25e6\u2019s indicate\nsignal s0, and the bullet \u2022 indicate either s1 or s2. When the system is in S2, the \u25e6\u2019s\nindicate s0, and the \u2022 indicate either s1 or s2. Under these models, either s1 or s2 will\ncause i2 or i0, and therefore n2 is irrelevant and only n1 will appear in the formulas\nfor various probabilities and expected values. (For the definitions of n1, n2, refer to the\nsets Z0, Z1, Z2 defined in Section 1.) Under the model (I0,M0), neither investigation nor\nmaintenance will be carried out, and both n1 and n2 are irrelevant.\n6.1. Model (I2,M1+2).\nUnder this model, when either s1 or s2 appears, i2 will be carried out. If i2 shows\nthat the system is in state S\u03b3 , m\u03b3 (\u03b3 = 1, 2) will be carried out which will restore the\nsystem back to S0.\nThe probabilities for Cases 1 and 2 in Figure 1 to occur are identical to those shown\nin Section 4 for models (I1+2,M1+2) and (I0,M1+2); and thus the expected values E\u03b7[isp],\n20\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nE\u03b7[s\u03b3 ] and E\u03b7[m\u03b3 ] (\u03b7 = 1, 2, \u03b3 = 0, 1, 2) are identical to those of the models (I1+2,M1+2)\nand (I0,M1+2). We denote the probabilities for Cases 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Figure 1 by\nP \u22173 , P\n\u2217\n4 , P\n\u2217\n5 and P\n\u2217\n6 , respectively, These probabilities are as follows.\nP1 =\n\u221eX\nN1=0\nIN1.

Under the model (I2,M1+2), when the system\nis in S1, the 1 +N2 circles \u25e6\u2019s represent type 0 signals s0\u2019s. In Cases 6, when the system\nis in S2, the 1 +N3 circles \u25e6\u2019s represent type 0 signals s0\u2019s, and the bullet \u2022 represents\neither a type 1 signal s1 or a type 2 signal s2, where these two types of signal occur in\nthe ratio R1 : R2.\nReplacing i1 in the model (I1+2,M1+2) by i2 forms the model (I2,M1+2), and hence\nfor model (I2,M1+2) we have\nE\u03b7[i0] = E\u03b7[s0], E\u03b7[i1] = 0, E\u03b7[i2] = E\u03b7[s1] +E\u03b7[s2] (\u03b7 = 1, ..., 6).\nFor Cases 1 and 2, all the expected values of the number of signals, inspections and\nmaintenance actions are identical to those for the model (I1+2,M1+2). For Cases 3 \u2014 6,\n21\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \ncorresponding results can be obtained based on the probabilities P \u22173 , P\n\u2217\n4 , P\n\u2217\n5 , P\n\u2217\n6 , and the\ndetailed are omitted here.\n6.2 Model (I2,M2).\nUnder this model, an s1 or s2 will be followed by i2 which will correctly reveal the\nstate of the system, and if the system is in S1 or S2, m2 will be carried out which will\nrestore the system back to S0. The expressions P \u22173 , ..., P\n\u2217\n6 for the probabilities of Cases\n3, ..., 6 in Figure 1 are as the same as those for the model (I2,M1+2) in Sub-section 6.1.\nThe expressions P1 and P2 for the probabilities of Cases 1 and 2 in Figure 1 are identical\nto those of the model (I1+2,M1+2) in Section 4.\nSince i1 is not carried out, we have\nE\u03b7[i0] = E\u03b7[s0], E\u03b7[i1] = 0, E\u03b7[i2] = E\u03b7[s1] +E\u03b7[s2] (\u03b7 = 1, ..., 6).\nFor Cases 1 and 2, it can be seen that E1[m0] and E2[m0] are also identical to those\nof the model (I1+2,M1+2), and we have E1[m2] = P1, E2[m2] = P2.\nRefer to Cases 3, 4, 5, 6 in the Figure 1. Under model (I2,M2), when the system\nis in S1, the 1 +N2 circles \u25e6\u2019s represent type 0 signals s0\u2019s. In Case 4, when the system\nis in S2, the 1 +N3 circles \u25e6\u2019s represent type 0 signals s0\u2019s, and the bullet \u2022 represents\neither a type 0 signal s0 or a type 1 signal s1, where these two types of signal occur\nin the ratio R1 : R2. Hence from the expression for the numbers of items inspected\nE4[isp], E4[s\u03b3 ], E4[isp], E4[s\u03b3 ] (\u03b3 = 0, 1, 2) are identical to those of the model (I2,M1+2).\nIn Cases 3, 4, 5 and 6, since m1 is absent and the \u2022 represent m2, the expressions for\nE\u03b7[m\u03b3 ] (\u03b7 = 3, 4, 5, 6, \u03b3 = 0, 1, 2) are identical to those of model (I2,M1+2).\n6.3 Model (I0,M2).\n22\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nUnder this model, no inspection will be carried out, and s1 or s2 will always lead\nto m2. If the system is in Si (i = 1, 2), m2 will always restore the system back to S0.\nThe expressions of the probabilities for Cases 1 and 2 in Figure 1 are the same as the\nP1 and P2 for model (I1+2,M1+2) in Section 4. The expressions for the probabilities for\nCase 3, ..., 6 in Figure 1 and the expected number of items inspected are the same as\nthe P \u22173 , ..., P\n\u2217\n6 and E3[isp], ..., E6[isp] for model (I2,M1+2) in Sub-Section 6.1.\nFor the model (I0,M2), for all \u03b7 = 1, ..., 6 we have\nE\u03b7[i1] = E\u03b7[i2] = E\u03b7[i3] = 0,\nE\u03b7[m0] = E\u03b7[s0], E\u03b7[m1] = 0, E\u03b7[m2] = E\u03b7[s1] +E\u03b7[s2].\n6.4 Model (I0,M0).\nUnder this model, none of i1, i2, m1 and m1 will be employed. The system starts at\nS0, deteriorates to S1 if \u03c001 > 0, and then deteriorates to S2 if \u03c012 > 0. This model may\nbe applied when the cost required to carry out investigation and maintenance are high\ncompared to the penalty cost due to occurrence of nonconforming items.\n7. Economic design of inspection and maintenance policy\nIn reality, various factors determine whether to perform investigation and mainte-\nnance on the system. These factors include resources available, operational convenience,\nloss due to system failure and nonconforming items, and others. Generally speaking,\ninvestigation and maintenance should be carried out if the loss due to occurrence of\nnonconforming items is considerable.\nWe consider the following three types of cost: (1) penalty cost Cnc due to occurrence\nof nonconforming items, (2) investigation cost Civs, (3) maintenance cost Cm. If Ntol is\n23\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nthe expected total number of items produced in a cycle, the average total cost per item\nper cycle is\nc\u00af = (Cnc + Civs + Cm)\/Ntol.\nIn accordance with the investigation and maintenance policies defined in the previous\nsections, we consider the following fixed costs:\ncnc = the penalty cost incurred when a nonconforming item is produced,\ncivs,1 = cost of carrying out i1 each time,\ncivs,2 = cost of carrying out i2 each time,\ncm,1 = cost of carrying out m1 each time,\ncm,2 = cost of carrying out m2 each time.\nIn what follows,\nP\n\u03b7 will denote the summation over \u03b7 = 1, ..., 6 for Cases 1, ..., 6\nin Figure 1. Since all items are inspected, for all the models (I1+2,M1+2), (I2,M1+2),\n(I0,M1+2), (I2,M2) and (I0,M2) we have\nNtol =\nX\n\u03b7\nE\u03b7[isp],\nwhere the expressions for E\u03b7[isp] for the different models are given in Sections 4, 5,\n6 (and so are the expressions for E\u03b7[s0], E\u03b7[s1], E\u03b7[s2], E\u03b7[m1], E\u03b7[m2] in the following\nCnc, Civs, Cm).\nSince each nonconforming item gives a signal (either s0, s1 or s2), the expected total\nnumber of nonconforming items is\nP\n\u03b7(E\u03b7[s0] +E\u03b7[s1] +E\u03b7[s2]), giving\nCnc = cnc\nX\n\u03b7\n(E\u03b7[s0] +E\u03b7[s1] +E\u03b7[s2]).\nAs for Civs and Cm, we have\nCivs = civs,1\nX\n\u03b7\nE\u03b7[i1] + civs,2\nX\n\u03b7\nE\u03b7[i2],\nCm = cm,1\nX\n\u03b7\nE\u03b7[m1] + cm,2\nX\n\u03b7\nE\u03b7[m2].\n24\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nFor the model (I0, M0), the system will change to state S2 eventually and remain in\nS2 indefinitely. The average number of items produced when the system is in states S0\nand S1 are 1\/\u03c001 and 1\/\u03c012, respectively. Therefore the average total cost is\nc\u00af = lim\nN\u2192\u221e\np0cnc\/\u03c001 + p1cnc\/\u03c012 + p2Ncnc\n1\/\u03c001E1 + 1\/\u03c012 +N\n= p2cnc,\nwhere N denotes the number of items produced after the process has shifted to state S2.\nReferring to the sets Z0, Z1, Z2 defined in Section 2, we see that the c\u00af for each\ninspection and maintenance model can be minimized with respect to n1 and n2 in the\nregion N = {(n1, n2) : 2 \u2264 n2 + 1 \u2264 n1 \u2264 \u221e}. Since c\u00af is an algebraic function of n1\nand n2, minimization can be carried out easily using software such as Mathematica. The\nminimum of c\u00af for the six maintenance models, say c\u00afmin, can be compared, and the most\ncost-effective model can be selected. It is clear that c\u00af depends on the parameters p0, p1,\np2, \u03c001, \u03c012, cnc, cinv,1, cinv,2, cm,1, cm,2, and the minimum cost c\u00afmin may be attained\nunder any of the five models (I1+2,M1+2), (I2,M1+2), (I0,M1+2), (I0,M2), (I0,M0). Table\n1 gives the numerical values of c\u00af for different values of the parameters and for different\nmodels. In each of the Cases (a) \u2014 (h) in Table 1, the minimum c\u00af\u2019s among the different\nmodels are high-lighted with square brackets. In Cases (a), (b), (c), the minimum c\u00af is\nattained under model (I1+2,M1+2). In Cases (d), (e), (f), (g), the minimum c\u00af is attained\nunder the models (I0,M1+2), (I2,M1+2), (I0,M2), (I0,M0), respectively.\nSince cm,1< cm,2, given any values of p0, p1, p2, \u03c001, \u03c012, cnc, cinv,1, cinv,2, cm,1,\ncm,2, it is easy to see from the expressions of Cm that the c\u00af for model (I2, M2) cannot be\nsmaller that of model (I2, M1+2). This is based on the assumption that cm,2 is the same\nfor both M2 and M1+2. However, in some cases an additional cost \u2206 per maintenance\naction is required to provide two types of maintenance services m1 and m2, rather than\njust a single type m2. If \u2206 is included into the the maintenance cost, the cost to carry\n25\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout m2 each time under the model (I2, M1+2) will be cm,2 + \u2206 which is larger than the\ncost cm,2 under the model (I2, M2). In this case, it is possible that c\u00afmin under the model\n(I2, M2) will be smaller than that under the model (I2, M1+2), and this is illustrated by\nCase (h) in Table 1. This idea can be extended to the case when an additional cost is\nincurred in order to maintain two types of inspection (minor i1 and major i2), instead of\njust one type (major i2).\nFor models (I1+2,M1+2) and (I0,M1+2), the minimum of c\u00af can be attained in the\ninterior or on the boundary of N . Cases (a) and (g) in Table 1 illustrate that for model\n(I1+2,M1+2), the minimum of c\u00af is attained in the interior of N (where 2 < n2+1 < n1 <\n\u221e), and Cases (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (h) illustrate that the minimum of c\u00af is attained on the\nboundary of N (where either 1 < n2 < n1 =\u221e, n2 = n1 =\u221e or 2 < n2 +1 = n1 <\u221e).\nIn Case (b), n1 = \u221e means that i0 does not exist, and occurrence of a nonconforming\nitem is either i1 or i2. In Case (c), n1 = n2 = \u221e indicates that both i0 and i1 do not\nexist, and any occurrence of nonconforming item is i2.\nTable 1.

Discussion.\nIn this paper, the authors apply the concept of cumulative count of conforming chart\n(CCC chart) to develop inspection and maintenance plans for production systems where\nan item produced can be classified as either conforming or nonconforming. All products\nitems produced are inspected, and the number of items inspected until a nonconforming\nitem is observed is used as an indicator for system monitoring. When a nonconform-\ning item is observed, either minor investigation, major investigation or no investigation\non the system may be carried out, and subsequently, either minor maintenance, major\nmaintenance or no maintenance on the system may be carried out. The author derived\nanalytic expressions of the probabilities for different cases to occur, expected numbers\nof signals, expected numbers of investigations and maintenance actions. With these re-\nsults, optimized investigation and maintenance strategies are obtained numerically from\nan economic approach.\nThis paper assumes that minor deterioration of the system can be detected by minor\n28\n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \ninvestigation, and major deterioration of the system can only be detected only by major\ninvestigation, which is illustrated by an example on maintenance of a bus fleet. In reality,\nthere is another situation where minor deterioration in the system is well-hidden and can\nbe detected only by major inspection, whereas major deterioration is conspicuous and can\nbe detected by minor inspection. Separate models can be established for this situation,\nand optimized investigation and maintenance strategies can be obtained.\nThis paper considers the case when system has three discrete states S0, S1, S2 and\nchanges from state S\u03b3 to state S\u03b3+1 with probability \u03c0\u03b3,\u03b3+1 (\u03b3 = 0, 1). This assumption\nhas been used in the literature (for example, in Das and Jain (1997), Das et al (1996),\nLorenzen and Vance (1986)) for the purpose of economic design of control charts. Sep-\narate studies can be carried out for the situation when deterioration of the system is\ncontinuous and the system has continuous states (see for example, Liao et al (2006)).\nIn practice, due to cost constraint or operational constraints, maintenance may not\nbe carried out immediately even when investigations show that the system is in an early\nstate of deterioration (Christer (1999), Liao et al (2008)). Signals on the control chart\nindicating minor deterioration of the system may be used an warnings, and actions will\nbe taken only when there are signals showing more serious deterioration.\nAcknowledgement.
