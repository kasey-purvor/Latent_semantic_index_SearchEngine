Introduction\n[2] Energetic electron precipitation from the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetosphere into the atmosphere has become recognized as\nan important process affecting the chemistry of the upper\natmosphere. Precipitating electrons produce forms of odd\nnitrogen (NOx) which undergo a series of chemical reactions\nthat deplete ozone [e.g., Thorne, 1977] and affect the radia-\ntion budget of the upper atmosphere. At high altitudes, NOx\nhas a short lifetime in sunlight due to photodissociation, but\nif it can be produced in darkness and transported downward\nto the stratosphere, or produced in the stratosphere directly,\nthe lifetime is much longer [Solomon et al., 1982] and the\npotential for ozone destruction is much higher. The polar\nregions are particularly important in this respect. The region\npoleward of 40\u00b0 invariant latitude corresponds to the highest\nelectron precipitation region [Gaines et al., 1995]. NOx pro-\nduced inside the polar vortex during winter can be transported\ndownward into the stratosphere to 35\u201340 km [Siskind et al.,\n2000; Randall et al., 2005, 2006; Clilverd et al., 2007]\nwhere it can accumulate. Up to 60% ozone depletion at 35\u2013\n40 km has been attributed to energetic electron precipitation\n[Randall et al., 2005], and atmospheric circulation models\nshow that this can result in a reduction of temperature of up to\n2 K in the polar regions, and up to 0.5 K at mid latitudes\n[Rozanov et al., 2005]. As NOx produced by energetic elec-\ntron precipitation is more frequent and persistent than that\nproduced by solar proton events [Randall et al., 2005],\nelectron precipitation from the Earth\u2019s inner magnetosphere\ncould be very important for communicating solar variability\nto the Earth\u2019s middle atmosphere [e.g., Kozyra et al., 2006].\n[3] There is a large uncertainty as to which energy range\nof precipitating electrons is more important in terms of their\neffects on stratospheric chemistry. Lower\u2010energy electrons\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\n3Space Weather Prediction Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA014619\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A00F08, doi:10.1029\/2009JA014619, 2010\nA00F08 1 of 15\n(1\u201310 keV) penetrate down to 100 km or so whereas 10\u2013\n100 keV electrons deposit most of their energy at altitudes\nin the range 75\u2013100 km. Much higher energy 0.1\u20131 MeV\nelectrons, associated with the Van Allen radiation belts,\npenetrate to lower altitudes of 55\u201375 km [e.g., Gaines et al.,\n1995]. In general the flux of precipitating electrons decreases\nrapidly with increasing energy and it is not yet clear\nwhether NOx produced at high altitudes by lower\u2010energy\nelectrons, which requires substantial downward transport,\nis more important than NOx produced at lower altitudes by\nhigher\u2010energy electrons. Observations suggest both are\nimportant under different conditions [Clilverd et al., 2007,\n2009].\n[4] While there have been several statistical studies of\nelectron precipitation in the 1\u201310 keV energy range at low\naltitudes, [e.g., Fuller\u2010Rowell and Evans, 1987; Roble and\nRidley, 1987; Newell et al., 1996a, 1996b; Hardy et al.,\n2008], statistical surveys of precipitating electrons at high-\ner energies are more difficult. This is partly due to the lack\nof energy coverage by particle detectors on low\u2010altitude\nsatellites measuring inside the loss cone, the restricted lati-\ntude coverage of satellites such as UARS and DEMETER,\nand the difficulty of measuring low precipitating flux at\nMeV energies inside the loss cone.\n[5] Nevertheless there are numerous observations of\nelectron precipitation at higher energies. Millan and Thorne\n[2007] give a comprehensive review of radiation belt elec-\ntron losses including losses due to precipitation into the\natmosphere. Balloon experiments up to \u223c300 keV show that\nmicrobursts are the main form of electron precipitation on\nthe dayside [Parks, 1978]. SAMPEX satellite observations\nshow that relativistic microburst precipitation is important\nduring geomagnetic storms [Blake et al., 1996; Lorentzen et\nal., 2001a, 2001b; O\u2019Brien and McPherron, 2003; O\u2019Brien\net al., 2004; Thorne et al., 2005]. On the duskside, relativ-\nistic precipitation associated with scattering by EMIC waves\nhas been observed using X\u2010ray observations from balloons\n[Foat et al., 1998; Lorentzen et al., 2000; Millan et al.,\n2002] and using SAMPEX [e.g., Bortnik et al., 2006].\nThere have also been observations of lightning\u2010induced\nelectron precipitation from the Earth\u2019s radiation belts in the\n\u223c1\u2013300 keV range [Voss et al., 1984, 1998; Inan et al.,\n2007, and references therein].\n[6] In one particular study of electron precipitation\n>30 keV it was noted that the distribution in magnetic local\ntime (MLT) is somewhat different to that for <10 keV,\nparticularly in the premidnight MLT sector [Codrescu et al.,\n1997]. This could be due to an energy dependency in the\nmechanism of production of precipitation, or to an energy\ndependency of the mechanism of transport of the source\nparticles. For example, intense electron precipitation <10 keV\nis associated with auroral acceleration processes which may\noccur on magnetic field lines extending into the magneto-\ntail, and which may overlap with a much broader region\nof diffuse precipitation extending equatorward caused by\nwave\u2010particle interactions near the magnetic equator.\nAbove 30 keV, and extending up to several MeV, the pre-\ncipitation is more likely to be associated with wave\u2010particle\ninteractions in the Van Allen radiation belts which act on\ndifferent timescales and different MLT regions. Possible\ncandidates include precipitation by whistler mode chorus,\nplasmaspheric hiss and electromagnetic ion cyclotron\nwaves.\n[7] In view of the importance of energetic electron pre-\ncipitation for atmospheric chemistry, the purpose of this\npaper is to determine the statistical distribution of >30 keV\nelectron precipitation and the wave\u2010particle interactions\nthat are most likely responsible. We present a global model\nof the E > 30 keV flux of precipitating electrons as a\nfunction of geomagnetic activity using data from four\nNOAA Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES)\n(section 2). Since whistler mode chorus waves are known to\nscatter electrons in this energy range (section 3) we compare\nthe results with an activity\u2010dependent global model of lower\u2010\nband chorus wave intensities derived from the Combined\nRelease and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) (section 3).\nWe examine the associated resonant energies and bounce\u2010\naveraged diffusion coefficients at the edge of the loss cone\n(section 4) and perform a correlation analysis (section 5) to\ninvestigate the relationship between the waves and the pre-\ncipitating electrons. The results are then compared with the\nabsorption measured by the Halley IRIS (section 6). The\nresults of our study are discussed in section 7 and the con-\nclusions presented in section 8.\n2. Electron Precipitation >30 keV\n[8] The particle data used in this study were collected by\nthe Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED)\non board the NOAA POES. These satellites orbit the Earth\napproximately 14 times each day in Sun\u2010synchronous, low\u2010\naltitude, polar orbits. Here we use data from NOAA\u201015,\nNOAA\u201016, NOAA\u201017, and NOAA\u201018 (Table 1).\n[9] The MEPED instrument includes two electron solid\u2010\nstate detector telescopes, each with a field of view of 30\u00b0,\nthat measure the flux of electrons in three energy bands in\nthe range 30 keV to 2,500 keV. One, called the \u20180\u00b0\u2019 tele-\nscope, is aligned such that the center of its field of view is\nrotated 9\u00b0 from the direction outward along the local zenith.\nThe other, called the \u201890\u00b0\u2019 telescope, is mounted perpen-\ndicular to the \u20180\u00b0\u2019 telescope. The center axis of its field of\nview is rotated 9\u00b0 from the direction antiparallel to the\ndirection of the spacecraft velocity. These rotations ensure a\nclear field of view.

POES, Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites.\nLAM ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION A00F08A00F08\n2 of 15\n30 keV channel are used. Data from each detector are accu-\nmulated for 1 s and, since the electronics are shared between\nthe two detectors, a full data set from both requires 2 s to\nacquire.\n[10] The E > 30 keV electron channel not only responds\nto electrons, but also to ring current protons in the energy\nrange 210 < E < 2700 keV. Using the MEPED proton\ntelescopes, which directly monitor the proton flux in six\nenergy bands in the range 30 keV to 6,900 keV, a first\u2010order\ncorrection was applied to the data to remove the protons.\nEven for geomagnetically active conditions, but excluding\nsolar proton events, the peak average precipitating proton\nflux in the range 80\u2013240 keV was 2 orders of magnitude\nlower than the peak average precipitating electron flux and\nthus we conclude that any error introduced by this process\nwas small. Details of the correction procedure are given in\nAppendix A.\n[11] Solar proton events, which may also contaminate the\nelectron channels, were removed using the NOAA Space\nEnvironment Center catalogue of solar proton events\naffecting the Earth\u2019s environment. Start dates were taken\ndirectly from the catalogue and the end dates were deter-\nmined from the time when the GOES\u20108 Space Environ-\nment Monitor E > 10 MeV flux fell below 10 cm\u22122s\u22121sr\u22121.\nData during these periods were removed.\n[12] The trapped electron flux is usually much greater\nthan the precipitating flux. Therefore, to obtain an accurate\nmeasure of the precipitating flux it is important to select data\nfrom the \u20180\u00b0\u2019 telescope only when it is measuring electrons\ninside the loss cone. To do this the local pitch angle at the\nsatellite, corresponding to the edge of the loss cone asatLC,\nwas determined by assuming conservation of the first adi-\nabatic invariant\n\u0001satLC \u00bc sin\u00021\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nBsat\nB120\nr\u0003 \u0004\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere Bsat is the ambient magnetic field at the spacecraft\nand B120 is the ambient magnetic field at the \u201cfoot of the\nfield line,\u201d i.e., the point where the magnetic field threading\nthe satellite intersects \u223c120 km in altitude above Earth. The\nmagnetic field vector both at the satellite and at the foot\nof the field line was calculated using the International\nGeomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model for halfway\nthrough the year in question. Since the MEPED detectors\nhave a finite opening angle of \u00b115\u00b0 precipitating particles\nwere selected using the condition\n\u0001sat \u00fe 15\u0003 < \u0001satLC \u00f02\u00de\nwhere asat is the particle pitch angle at the satellite. The field\nof view of the \u20180\u00b0\u2019 telescope typically lies completely within\nthe bounce loss cone for L > \u223c1.4 [Rodger et al., 2010].\n[13] Since the electron flux falls rapidly with increasing\nenergy the electron telescope sensor was checked to ensure\nthe counts in the E > 30 keV channels were greater than or\nequal to those in the E > 100 keV channel, and similarly,\nthat the counts for E > 100 keV channels were greater than\nor equal to those in the E > 300 keV channel. The precip-\nitating electron flux was then binned as a function of\nMcIlwain L shell and MLT in steps of 0.1 L and 1 h MLT\nfor each of the four satellites. The McIlwain L shell is cal-\nculated using the IGRF model of the magnetic field and the\nNational Space Science Data Center INVAR program.\n[14] The global morphology of the precipitating electron\nflux E > 30 keV is shown as a function of L, MLT and\ngeomagnetic activity in Figures 1a\u20131c. The results are\nshown for quiet (AE < 100 nT), moderate (100 < AE <\n300 nT), and active (AE > 300 nT) geomagnetic conditions\nas measured by the AE index in Figures 1a\u20131c, respectively.\nDuring quiet conditions (Figure 1a) the precipitating flux\nis low and generally less than 2 \u00d7 104 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121. The\nflux tends to be largest for L \u2265 6, at night between 2000\u2013\n0300 MLT, and on the dayside between 0500\u20131700 MLT.\nHowever, as magnetic activity increases the precipitating\nflux increases substantially from just before midnight,\nthrough dawn to the afternoon sector. During active condi-\ntions AE > 300 nT the precipitating flux extends to lower L\nand over a larger range of MLT with fluxes exceeding 5 \u00d7\n105 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 for L > 4 from 2100 MLT through dawn\nto 1200 MLT.\n3. Source of Electron Precipitation\n[15] The fact that the region of electron precipitation\nextends to as low as L = 4 during very active conditions\nsuggests that there may be a number of sources, and hence a\nnumber of mechanisms responsible for the precipitation.\nOne of the most well known types of precipitation is that\nassociated with the discrete aurora, but this is usually due to\n1\u201310 keV electrons [e.g., Fuller\u2010Rowell and Evans, 1987;\nNewell et al., 1996a, 1996b] which have been accelerated\nabove the ionosphere on auroral field lines. This is some-\nwhat lower in energy than that discussed here. Since the\nMLT distribution of the precipitation is consistent with\ninjection and transport of >30 keV electrons from the\nnightside through dawn to the dayside under the action of\nconvection electric fields, precipitation by wave\u2010particle\ninteractions operating near the magnetic equatorial region\nappears to be more likely. There are a number of candidates.\nElectrostatic waves generally resonate and scatter electrons\nin the 0.1\u201310 keV energy range [e.g., Horne and Thorne,\n2000] are therefore too low in energy. On the other hand,\nelectromagnetic ion cyclotron waves generally resonate with\n>500 keV electrons which appears too high in energy\n[Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers and Thorne, 2003;\nJordanova et al., 2008; Miyoshi et al., 2008].\n[16] Meredith et al. [2004] show plasmaspheric hiss\ngenerally scatters electrons in the 20 keV to 2 MeV energy\nrange, so hiss is a possible candidate. During active condi-\ntions, equatorial hiss (\u2223MLAT\u2223 < 15\u00b0) is seen from 0600 to\n2100 MLT and midlatitude hiss from 0800 to 1800 MLT\nand mostly confined to the plasmasphere (2 < L < 4). Hiss\ndoes extend out beyond L = 6 in high\u2010density plumes\n[Meredith et al., 2004; Summers et al., 2008], however this\ntends to be confined to the postnoon sector. Plasmaspheric\nhiss is therefore not in the right location to be the source of\nthe electron precipitation examined in this paper.\n[17] Whistler mode chorus waves resonate with electrons\nover a wide range of energies, from a few hundred eV up to\nseveral MeV [e.g., Horne et al., 2005] and thus appear to\nbe the most favorable candidate. The emissions are often\nLAM ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION A00F08A00F08\n3 of 15\nFigure 1.

Both bands are substorm\u2010dependent and emissions\nintensify during active conditions [Tsurutani and Smith,\n1977; Meredith et al., 2001; Miyoshi et al., 2003]. Elec-\ntrons with energies of the order of 1 keV or so tend to\nresonate with upper band chorus [Inan et al., 1992;\nJohnstone et al., 1993]. At higher energies, lower\u2010band\nchorus provides more effective scattering, especially near\nthe loss cone [Ni et al., 2008].\n[18] To test whether whistler mode chorus waves could be\nthe source of electron precipitation observed here we ana-\nlyzed data from the plasma wave experiment on board the\nCRRES [Johnson and Kierein, 1992]. This instrument\nmeasured electric fields from 5.6 Hz to 400 kHz, using a\n100 m tip\u2010to\u2010tip long wire antenna [Anderson et al., 1992].\nChorus electric field spectral intensities were first converted\nto magnetic field spectral intensities, as described by\nMeredith et al. [2003]. Since energetic electrons interact\nmost readily with lower\u2010band chorus (0.1 < f\/fce < 0.5)\n[Horne and Thorne, 1998], the derived wave spectral\nintensity (pT2 Hz\u22121) was integrated over this frequency range\nto obtain the lower\u2010band chorus magnetic field intensity,\nBw\n2 , where Bw is the wave magnetic field amplitude. Bw\n2\ntogether with the ratio fpe\/fce, were then rebinned as a\nfunction of half\u2010orbit (outbound or inbound) and L in steps\nof 0.1 L. For more detailed spectral analysis the wave\nmagnetic field intensities from 0.1 fce to fcewere rebinned in\nsteps of 0.1 fce at the same spatial resolution. The wave data\nwere recorded together with the time in UT, magnetic lati-\ntude (lm), MLT and time spent in each bin at the same\nresolution. The L value and magnetic latitude were deter-\nmined using the Olson\u2010Pfitzer tilt\u2010dependent static model\n[Olson and Pfitzer, 1977] and the IGRF 85 model.\n[19] Figures 1d\u20131f show the global morphology of lower\u2010\nband chorus magnetic field wave intensities in the equatorial\nregion, averaged over the magnetic latitude range \u2223lm\u2223 <\n30\u00b0, as a function of L, MLT and geomagnetic activity.\nWave intensities increase with substorm activity similar to\nthe precipitating flux. The MLT distribution of the waves for\nmedium and active conditions is also very similar to that\nfor the precipitating flux, and both precipitation and wave\npower extend to lower L (L \u2248 4) for increasing AE. During\nactive conditions (Figure 1f) the wave intensity typically\nexceeds 1000 pT2 for L > 4 from 2100 MLT through dawn\nto 1500 MLT. This qualitative agreement suggests that\nresonant pitch angle scattering of electrons by lower\u2010band\nchorus could be a very important source of E > 30 keV\nelectron precipitation into Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n4. Electron Pitch Angle Diffusion\n4.1. Resonant Energies\n[20] The waves shown in Figure 1 span a range of fre-\nquencies and latitudes near the magnetic equator. Ideally it\nwould be desirable to measure the precipitating electron flux\nnear the equator that is directly associated with these waves\nand compare it to that observed by POES at the foot of the\nfield line. Unfortunately the size of the loss cone near the\nequator is so small (typically 5\u00b0 degrees at L = 4) that it\ncannot be resolved by particle detectors. However, for a\ngiven band of waves we can determine the range of resonant\nenergies that can be scattered efficiently by the waves, or\nalternatively, for a given electron energy range we can\ndetermine the range of resonant frequencies and test how\nwell these correspond to the frequency at which wave\npower maximizes. Here we assume that the scattering can be\ntreated as a diffusion problem where the electrons interact\nwith a series of uncorrelated waves, but note that chorus\nwaves also undergo nonlinear wave\u2010particle interactions\nwhich have yet to be fully assessed [e.g., Omura et al.,\n2007].\n[21] Electron diffusion by the waves is most effective\nwhen the resonance condition is satisfied\n!\u0002 kkvk \u00fe nj\u0001ej=\u0003 \u00bc 0 \u00f03\u00de\nwhere w is the (angular) wave frequency, We is the electron\ncyclotron frequency (\u2223We\u2223 = 2pfce), kk is the wave number\nparallel to the ambient magnetic field B0, g = (1 \u2212 v2\/c2)\u22121\/2,\nv2 = v?\n2 + vk\n2, v? and vk are the electron velocities perpen-\ndicular and parallel to B0, and n is the harmonic number. For\nwhistler mode waves w < \u2223We\u2223, and so for parallel propa-\ngation along B0, resonance is possible when the wave fre-\nquency is Doppler\u2010shifted up in frequency to the cyclotron\nfrequency. For propagation along the magnetic field, with\nthe convention that We < 0, the resonance with the lowest\nresonant energy is n = \u22121. The resonance condition is then\nan ellipse in velocity space and the minimum resonant\nenergy is obtained from the point where the ellipse touches\nthe v? = 0 axis. The wave number, kk, is determined by\nsolving the cold plasma dispersion relation for whistler mode\nwaves propagating parallel to the magnetic field, which, for\nan electron\u2010proton plasma is given by [e.g., Walker, 1993]\nc2k2k\n!2\n\u00bc 1\u0002 !\n2\npe\n!\u00f0!\u0002 j\u0001ej\u00de \u0002\n!2pi\n!\u00f0!\u00fe \u0001p\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Wp is the proton cyclotron frequency, wpe and wpi are\nthe electron and proton plasma frequencies.

Figures 2a and 2b show the average equatorial\n(\u2223lm\u2223 < 15\u00b0) and midlatitude (15\u00b0 < \u2223lm\u2223 < 30\u00b0) chorus wave\nmagnetic field intensities as a function of normalized fre-\nquency and MLT. The frequency for resonance with 30 keV\nelectrons (from here on referred to as the resonant fre-\nquency) is shown by the black line in Figures 2a and 2b.\nWaves at lower frequencies resonate with >30 keV elec-\ntrons. Figure 2d shows the ratio fpe\/fce. For the calculations\nin this paper we have averaged fpe and fce over the\nappropriate latitude ranges.\n[23] In computing the resonant frequency the measured\nelectron plasma frequency, averaged over the appropriate\nlatitude range, was used. Between 2200 and 1400 MLT the\nresonant frequency lies in the range of strong equatorial\nLAM ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION A00F08A00F08\n5 of 15\nchorus (Figure 2a) wave power but falls below 0.1 fce on the\ndusk side between 1600 and 2200 MLT. The reduction in\nfrequency on the dusk side is mainly due to the higher\nelectron plasma frequency in this region. At mid latitudes\n(Figure 2b) the resonant frequency is higher than that at the\nequator, due to the higher background magnetic field, and\nlies in the region of strong mid latitude chorus between\n0600 and 1400 MLT. Thus both equatorial and mid lati-\ntude waves can both contribute to electron diffusion for E \u2265\n30 keV into the loss cone and hence precipitation. It is also\nclear that there is strong wave power at frequencies above\nthe resonant frequency, particularly near dawn, and that this\ncan contribute to diffusion of <30 keV electrons.\n[24] Figure 2c shows the trapped and precipitating elec-\ntron flux measured at the same L by POES near the foot of\nthe magnetic field line. The trapped flux always dominates\nthe precipitating flux, by a factor of 5 or more, indicating\nthat electron diffusion into the loss cone is a result of weak\nFigure 2. A representative example of the waves and the precipitation for active magnetic conditions is\nshown in Figure 2 for L = 5.05.

It is interesting to note that the trapped flux\npeaks near dawn and has a minimum near 1900\u20132000 MLT.\nThis is discussed later. The precipitating flux tends to follow\nthe trend in the trapped flux, and is high in the region where\nthe resonant frequency overlaps with strong lower\u2010band\nchorus wave intensity, but is much lower than the trapped\nflux in the afternoon sector where the lower\u2010band chorus\nwave power is low, and the resonant frequency is low. Since\nelectron diffusion is proportional to wave power this vari-\nation supports the link between the waves and the precipi-\ntating flux. It should be noted that at an altitude of \u223c800 km,\nthe perpendicular fluxes are only barely trapped and are\nsometimes located in the drift loss cone. Mapped to the\nequator, this represents a pitch angle range which is only\nslightly above the loss cone and may not be representative\nof the true trapped population.\n4.2. Pitch Angle Diffusion Rates\n[25] Although the waves can resonate with the electrons in\nthe appropriate energy range, this does not ensure that the\nwaves diffuse electrons into the loss cone. Wave\u2010particle\ninteractions diffuse electrons in pitch angle and energy in\nsuch a way as to reduce the gradients in the electron dis-\ntribution function. In the equatorial region the electron dis-\ntribution usually falls rapidly with energy and contains a\ngradient in pitch angle due to the presence of the loss cone\n[e.g., Horne et al., 1987]. However, pitch angle diffusion\ndoes not always extend into the loss cone, for example,\nmagnetosonic waves, which can occur in the same fre-\nquency range as parallel propagating whistler mode waves,\nonly scatter electrons at very large pitch angles and thus do\nnot contribute to precipitation directly [Horne et al., 2007].\nFurthermore, pitch angle diffusion depends on several\nproperties of the waves, such as the direction of propagation,\nthe bandwidth, wave intensity and latitude distribution of\nthe waves. To establish whether lower\u2010band chorus waves\ndiffuse electrons into the loss cone effectively, here we\npresent pitch angle diffusion coefficients calculated at 30 keV\nat the edge of the loss cone. Of course the precipitation\nflux depends on both the diffusion rates and the gradients at\nthe edge of the loss cone, but in the absence of detailed\nparticle measurements the diffusion coefficients are used\nhere as a proxy.\n[26] The pitch angle and energy diffusion of ions and\nelectrons (PADIE) code [Glauert and Horne, 2005] was\nused to calculate bounce\u2010averaged pitch angle diffusion\nrates. Bounce averaging takes into account the latitudinal\ndistribution of the waves and the interactions between the\nwaves and electrons as electrons travel along the magnetic\nfield line between mirror points in the northern and southern\nhemispheres. The code assumes that the wave intensity can\nbe described by a Gaussian distribution, and that the dis-\ntribution of wave normal angles, i.e., the wave propagation\ndirection, is Gaussian in X = tan y, where y is the angle\nbetween the magnetic field direction and the k vector of the\nwaves. The wave parameters are based on those used before\nfor studying lower\u2010band whistler mode chorus, and which\nwere obtained from analyzing whistler mode data [Meredith\net al., 2002; Horne et al., 2005] and used in global simu-\nlation models [Varotsou et al., 2005, 2008; Fok et al., 2008;\nAlbert et al., 2009]. Maximum wave power was set to a\nfrequency of 0.35fce, with a bandwidth of 0.15fce, and lower\nand upper cutoffs at 0.125fce and 0.575fce outside which\nwave power is set to zero. The distribution of wave normal\nangles is set with a peak at X = tan 0\u00b0 with an angular spread\nof Xw = tan30\u00b0. An electron\u2010proton plasma was assumed\nand Landau n = 0 and n = \u00b11, \u00b12,.. \u00b15 cyclotron harmonic\ninteractions were included. Higher\u2010order resonances were\nsmall by comparison. The appropriate values of fpe\/fce were\nselected according to the data at each L shell and MLT, and\nthe diffusion rates, which are proportional to wave inten-\nsity, were scaled by the observed wave intensity in each data\nbin corresponding to 0.1L and 1 h MLT. Since chorus tends\nto be restricted to within \u00b115\u00b0 of the magnetic equator on\nthe nightside whereas dayside chorus extends to \u00b130\u00b0 and\nbeyond, the bounce averaged pitch angle diffusion coeffi-\ncients hDaaiLC\/p2 at the edge of the loss cone were calcu-\nlated separately for equatorial (\u2223lm\u2223 < 15\u00b0) and midlatitude\nchorus (15\u00b0 < \u2223lm\u2223 < 30\u00b0).\n[27] Figure 3 shows the bounce\u2010averaged diffusion rates\nat 30 keV for active magnetic conditions. For equatorial\nchorus (Figure 3a) diffusion rates peak near dawn near L =\n5\u20136 and typically exceed 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 over a wide range\nof MLT 2300\u20130900 MLT for L > 4.5. At mid latitudes\n(Figure 3b) diffusion rates are strongest on the dayside\nwhich largely reflects the MLT distribution of the waves\n(compare with Figures 2a and 2b). When both equatorial\nand mid latitude diffusion rates are combined (Figure 3c)\npitch angle diffusion into the loss cone is possible for a\nwide range of L and MLT, comparable to that observed for\nelectron precipitation (Figure 1c).\n5. Correlation Analysis\n[28] If lower\u2010band chorus is largely responsible for the\nprecipitation of E > 30 keV electrons, then there should be a\nsignificant correlation between the diffusion rates and the\nE > 30 keV precipitating electron flux. To try to quantify\nthis relation, Figure 4a shows the Pearson correlation coef-\nficient r between the logarithm of the E > 30 keV electron\nprecipitating flux and the logarithm of hDaaiLC\/p2. This has\nbeen done for high geomagnetic activity, i.e., AE > 300 nT.\nFigure 4b shows the minimum value of the confidence\ninterval for the correlation values (see Appendix B for more\ndetails).\n[29] When the correlation is calculated for all MLT (black\nline) the correlations values are significant (minimum con-\nfidence interval of 95%) for L > 4.7 (black diamonds). The\ncorrelation is large (r > 0.8) for L > 5.1, and drops to lower\nvalues for L \u2264 5.1.\n[30] Similar large correlations (r > 0.8) are obtained for\nL > 5.1 when the data are split into dayside (purple) and\nnightside (green) sectors. The correlation on the nightside\nis r = 0.5 at L = 4 with at least a 95% confidence interval.\nAs L decreases below 5.1, the dayside correlation becomes\nincreasingly smaller than that on the nightside which may\nindicate that the correlation for L < 5 is much higher on the\nnightside than the dayside (unfortunately the minimum\nconfidence interval for dayside correlation drops below\n95% for L < 4.7).\nLAM ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION A00F08A00F08\n8 of 15\n[31] When the correlation is performed over 3 < L < 6.6,\nand presented as a function of MLT (Figure 5a), the cor-\nrelation exceeds 0.8 between 0200\u20131100 MLT, and is even\nhigher near dawn (>0.95 between 0500 and 0800 MLT)\nbefore dropping in the afternoon sector. The minimum\nconfidence intervals are 95% or greater (except at\n15.5 MLT).\n6. Ionospheric Absorption\n[32] Ground\u2010based riometers provide an alternative mea-\nsure of E > 40 keV electron precipitation by measuring the\nabsorption of cosmic radio noise [Collis et al., 1984]. As\nradio signals propagate through the ionosphere electron\nprecipitation increases ionization and the collision frequency\nwhich leads to absorption of the signal. The method is most\nsensitive to electron precipitation of a few tens of keV in the\naltitude region 70\u2013110 km, and has been well established\n[Hargreaves, 1979]. The absorption of cosmic radio noise at\nHalley Research station (75\u00b0 35\u2032 S, 26\u00b034\u2032 W) has been\nfound to depend on the AE index and MLT, with the highest\nabsorption occurring in the 0400\u20131600 MLT sector for AE >\n140 nT, and in the 1200\u20132000 MLT sector for AE \u2264 140 nT\n[Rosenberg and Dudeney, 1986]. The British Antarctic\nSurvey have operated an imaging riometer for ionospheric\nstudies (IRIS) at Halley Research Station for several years.\nSince the Halley Research Station is located at L \u223c 4.3 we\ncan use Halley IRIS data to provide an independent measure\nof electron precipitation.\n[33] The Halley IRIS operated at 38.2 MHz, and recorded\ndata at 1 s resolution. In order to provide high spatial res-\nolution we selected data from the central beam of the 49\nbeams which had a viewing angle of 11\u00b0 corresponding to a\ncircular radius of \u223c9 km at 90 km altitude [Rosenberg et al.,\n1991]. Because of a variety of performance issues, including\nthe effect of snow accumulation on the riometer\u2019s perfor-\nmance [Rose et al., 2000], data were restricted to the period\n1999\u20132001. Data collected during periods of solar proton\nevents were removed and the remaining data corrected\nfor the quiet day curve, including a 0.2 dB offset which\noccurred in the 2001 data due to a slightly inaccurate\nquiet day curve. Since the response of the riometer is much\nstronger in daylight than in darkness, only data taken when\nHalley was in daylight (October\u2013February) were used. The\ndata were rebinned into 1 min averages as a function of\nMLT and AE, and selected for active magnetic conditions\nAE > 300 nT.\n[34] Figure 6 shows the riometer data (middle) in com-\nparison with the previously calculated pitch angle diffusion\ncoefficients (top) and precipitating electron flux (bottom) for\nactive conditions (AE > 300 nT). The riometer absorption\nshows the same general trend as both the measured electron\nprecipitation and the pitch angle diffusion rates. It peaks just\nbefore dawn and has a minimum near 1800 MLT. The\nFigure 5.

Both satellite and riometer\nobservations suggest that chorus waves near dawn are most\neffective in causing electron precipitation. This region cor-\nresponds to equatorial chorus waves rather than mid latitude\nchorus, as shown in Figure 3.\n7. Discussion\n[35] The flux of trapped electrons in Figure 2c falls by\napproximately an order of magnitude between 0600 MLT\nand 1200 MLT. The electron flux is controlled by a number\nof processes in this region, including the supply and trans-\nport of electrons via substorms and convective electric fields\n[e.g., Lyons et al., 2005; Miyoshi et al., 2007], losses to the\natmosphere via electron precipitation, and transport out of\nthe region to the dayside. The timescale for transport of\n30 keV electrons from the nightside neutral line to noon in\nthe region 4.5 < L < 6.5 is of the order of a few hours during\nactive conditions [e.g., Chen and Schulz, 2001a, 2001b]. If\nwe estimate the electron loss timescales from the reciprocal\nof the bounce\u2010averaged pitch angle diffusion coefficient at\nthe edge of the loss cone [Shprits et al., 2006] then the loss\ntimescale is of the order of 30 min or so near dawn. This is\nthe timescale for the trapped flux to decay by a factor of e.\nSince the flux shown in Figure 2c are for constant L = 5.05\nand we have no detailed information on the drift orbits here\nwe cannot make an exact comparison, but we can at least\ndeduce that electron loss should play an important role in the\nreduction in >30 keV flux at least near dawn and into the\ndayside.\n[36] The data in Figure 2c show that the precipitating\nelectron flux is at least a factor of 5 lower than the trapped\nflux, on average, during active times and therefore the\nelectrons are in weak diffusion. We can use this observation\nas an independent check on calculated pitch angle diffusion\nrates. Under strong pitch angle diffusion electrons are dif-\nfused across the loss cone in less than a quarter of the\nelectron bounce period and the flux within the loss cone\napproaches isotropy. The diffusion rates computed in Figure 6a\nshould therefore be less than the strong diffusion rate. The\nstrong diffusion rate is given by [Schulz, 1974; Summers and\nThorne, 2003]\nDSD \u00bc 9:66L4\n4L\n4L\u0002 3\n\u0005 \u00061=2 \u00bdE\u00f0E \u00fe 2E0\u00de\u00041=2\n\u00f0E \u00fe E0\u00de \u00f05\u00de\nin s\u22121 where E0 = m0c\n2. The strong diffusion rate varies from\nDSD \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121 at L = 4 to 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 at L = 7.\nFigure 6a shows that the bounce averaged diffusion rates are\nlower than the strong diffusion rate at L = 4, and at L = 7,\nconsistent with the data, but may sometimes approach the\nstrong diffusion rate near dawn.\n[37] Our results suggest that since >30 keV precipitation\nis MLT\u2010dependent, NOx production is also MLT\u2010dependent.\nThe longer the precipitation lasts however the more geo-\ngraphically uniform the production of NOx will be, pro-\nvided scattering is strong enough to scatter electrons into\nthe bounce loss cone, as is the case for \u223c300 keV electrons\n[Horne et al., 2009]. If precipitation lasts 24 h then we\nexpect NOx production to have some degree of geographical\nuniformity.\n[38] Precipitating >30 keV electrons tend to produce NOx\nat \u223c95 km and below [see Rees, 1989, Figure 3.3.3]. If\nvertical transport within the polar vortex takes place at a rate\nFigure 6.

This is shorter than the period of\ndarkness in the polar regions so that NOx generated by\n>30 keV electrons in early to mid winter should reach the\nstratosphere without undergoing photodissociation. The\nArctic vortex of 2003\u20132004 was a particularly powerful\nvortex for the northern hemisphere, however it should be\nnoted that the Antarctic polar vortex is generally more\npronounced and persistent than the Arctic one.\n[39] In the northern hemisphere, the maximum descent\nrate associated with the polar vortex is not over the pole but\nat 60\u00b0 N [Callaghan and Salby, 2002; Clilverd et al., 2007;\nRandall et al., 2006] which corresponds to L \u223c 3\u20138 (and a\nmean L of 4.3). We have shown that significant >30 keV\nelectron precipitation occurs for L \u223c 4\u20137 during active con-\nditions (Figure 1), that is, NOx generated by such precipita-\ntion occurs at latitudes where the polar vortices can have\nsignificant downward transport.\n[40] There is not a significant hemispherical difference\nin the >30 keV electron precipitation flux for L > 3 [Baker\net al., 2001; Horne et al., 2009], however we anticipate a\nhemispherical difference in the amount of NOx transported\nto the stratosphere due to the asymmetry in the strength\nand persistence of the Arctic and Antarctic polar vortices.\n8. Summary and Conclusions\n[41] We have built a statistical model of the E > 30 keV\nprecipitating flux as a function of L, magnetic local time\n(MLT), and geomagnetic activity using data from the\nNOAA POES satellites and compared it to the statistical\ndistribution of lower\u2010band chorus wave intensities observed\nin the equatorial and mid latitude region of the magneto-\nsphere. We calculated the associated resonant energies and\nbounce\u2010averaged diffusion coefficients at the edge of the\nloss cone and performed a correlation analysis to investigate\nwhether lower\u2010band chorus waves could provide the source\nof >30 keV electron precipitation. Our key results are\n[42] 1. The precipitating flux of E > 30 keV electrons\nvaries significantly in MLT and increases substantially with\ngeomagnetic activity as measured by the AE index. The data\nsuggest that electron precipitation is related to substorm\nactivity.\n[43] 2. There is a strong similarity between the distribu-\ntion of precipitating electrons >30 keV, riometer absorption\nat Halley, lower\u2010band chorus wave intensity, and bounce\u2010\naveraged pitch angle diffusion rates at the edge of the loss\ncone in MLT and L. There is a high correlation between\nelectron precipitation and pitch angle diffusion rates with\ncorrelation coefficients as high as r > 0.8 for L > 5.1. The\ncorrelation becomes even higher in MLT reaching r > 0.95\nnear dawn (between 0500 and 0800 MLT).\n[44] 3. The trapped electron flux is at least a factor of 5\nlarger than the precipitating flux suggesting that, on average,\nthere is no evidence for strong pitch angle diffusion into the\nloss cone. Pitch angle diffusion rates calculated from lower\u2010\nband chorus wave intensities are also generally less than the\nstrong diffusion rate.\n[45] 4. Since >30 keV precipitation is dependent on MLT\nand geomagnetic activity, NOx production should also be\nMLT\u2010dependent and activity\u2010dependent. The longer the\nprecipitation, however the more geographically uniform\nNOx production should be.\n[46] 5. Significant >30 keV electron precipitation occurs\nfor L \u223c 4\u20137 during active conditions. NOx generated by such\nprecipitation will occur at latitudes where the polar vortices\n(especially in the southern hemisphere) can have significant\ndownward transport. Such levels of transport should be suffi-\ncient to deposit the NOx from its altitude of generation down-\nward to the stratosphere during the course of a polar winter.\n[47] We conclude that a very important mechanism for\nprecipitating \u223c30 keV electrons from the inner magneto-\nsphere into the atmosphere is via pitch angle scattering by\nlower\u2010band chorus waves and that on average the process is\ndescribed by weak pitch angle diffusion and not strong\ndiffusion. The process, which is strongly dependent on\nmagnetic activity, is capable of producing NOx at locations\nwhere it can be transported to altitudes that are low enough\nto affect stratospheric chemistry.\nAppendix A: Removing Proton Contamination\nFrom the POES MEPED Electron Measurements\n[48] The POES SEM\u20102 MEPED detectors are intended to\nmeasure the flux of both energetic protons and electrons\nseparately with two different sets of telescope detectors.\nHowever, numerical simulations as well as experimental\ntests of the instrument performed by placing the detectors in\nparticle beams show that the instrument does not always\ncorrectly separate the two species. Some protons entering\nthe electron telescopes are mistakenly counted as electrons\nand vice versa. Here we focus on correcting the electron flux\nmeasurements by subtracting the contaminating proton flux.\nFortunately, a correction is at least possible because the\nSEM\u20102 proton telescopes measure the flux of protons within\nthe energy range that will also contaminate the electron\ntelescopes. However, the energy resolution of the proton\ndetectors is coarsemaking an accurate correction challenging.\nThe goal of the method described here is to define the proton\nenergy spectrum and thus the electron correction as accurately\nas possible with the limited information available.\n[49] Simulations and tests show that the POES measure-\nments of >30 keV, >100 keV, and >300 keV electrons are\ncontaminated by 210\u20132700 keV protons, 280\u20132700 keV\nprotons, and 440\u20132700 keV protons, respectively. Three of\nthe six energy channels sampled by the MEPED proton\ntelescope span these ranges. The p2, p3 and p4 channels\nmeasure the flux of protons with energies from 80\u2013240 keV,\n240\u2013800 keV, 800\u20132500 keV, respectively. Unfortunately,\nthese channels do not perfectly bracket the contaminating\nproton ranges so the correction is not just a simple sub-\ntraction of these counts. For example, the >30 keV electron\nchannel is contaminated by protons with energy above\n210 keV but the p2 channel begins measuring protons at\n80 keV. The counts measured by the p2 channel from only\nthose protons with energy >210 keV will depend heavily on\nhow the flux varies with energy within the 80\u2013240 keV\nrange. Likewise, only some fraction of the counts measured\nin the p3 channel will contribute to the contamination of the\n>100 and >300 keV electron measurements. Since the en-\nergy spectrum within a given energy channel is not known,\nit must be assumed.\nLAM ET AL.: ENERGETIC ELECTRON PRECIPITATION A00F08A00F08\n11 of 15\n[50] We estimate the proton energy spectrum by assuming\nthat it is a series of piecewise exponential functions across\neach measured proton energy channel range. We define the\ninitial exponential functions using a bow tie method and\niterate to improve our knowledge of that spectrum. The bow\ntie method is defined by Selesnick and Blake [2000] and\nrepeated here for completeness.\n[51] The total counts measured within an energy band can\nbe defined by\nC \u00bc\nZ E2\nE1\nJ\u00f0E;\u0001;A; t\u00dedEd\u0001dAdt \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere C is the number of counts recorded by the detector\nduring the integration time interval (1 s for the MEPED\ndetectors), J(E, W, A, t) is the differential flux (in cm\u22122 s\u22121\nsr\u22121 keV\u22121) of particles entering the detector, E is the energy\nof the particle, W is solid angle, A is the silicon detector area,\nand t is time. Assuming that the flux hitting the detector\ndoes not vary with the angle of incidence area, or time then\nintegrating gives\nC \u00bc G\nZ E2\nE1\nJ\u00f0E\u00dedE \u00f0A2\u00de\nwhere G is the geometric factor. G for the MEPED instru-\nment is .01 cm\u22122 s\u22121 str\u22121. Now assume that the flux de-\ncreases exponentially with energy such that,\nC \u00bc G\nZ E2\nE1\nJ0\u00f0E\u00de exp\u00f0\u0002E=E0\u00dedE \u00f0A3\u00de\n[52] Approximate the integral as the rectangular area with\nheight J(~E) and width DE such that,\nG\nZ E2\nE1\nJ0\u00f0E\u00de exp\u00f0\u0002E=E0\u00dedE \u00bc GJ0 exp\u00f0\u0002~E=E0\u00de\u0003E\n\u00bc GJ \u00f0~E\u00de\u0003E\n\u00f0A4\u00de\n[53] Using the approximation from (9), the counts mea-\nsured within a given instrument energy band are converted\nto differential flux by\nJ\u00f0~E\u00de \u00bc C\nG\u0003E\n\u00f0A5\u00de\n[54] The two quantities ~E and DE are related by\n\u0003E \u00bc exp\u00f0\u0002~E=E0\u00de\nZ E2\nE1\nexp\u00f0\u0002E=E0\u00dedE \u00f0A6\u00de\nand can be plotted as a curve by assuming a fixed E0.\nPlotting these curves for different values of E0 creates a\nfigure that looks like a bow tie. Fixed values of ~E and DE\nare chosen for each energy band that do not vary much with\ndifferent assumed spectra. Bow tie plots for the p2, p3 and\np4 channels are shown in Figure 7. The values chosen for\n~E for p2, p3 and p4 are 138 keV, 346 keV and 926 keV\nand the corresponding values of DE are 147.9, 345.5, and\n461.8 keV. We use these values of ~E and DE to give an\ninitial guess at the proton flux in each energy channel.\n[55] To improve our knowledge of the proton flux and\nenergy spectrum we iterate. We calculate new values for E0\nusing neighboring flux values. Keeping ~E fixed, we use\nequation (A6) and the new values of E0 to calculate DE for\neach energy channel. We use the new value of DE in\nequation (A5) to define new flux values and repeat the\nprocess until the values of E0 do not change significantly.\nLastly, using the piecewise exponential description of the\nproton energy spectrum we integrate the proton flux from\n210\u20132700 keV, 280\u20132700 keV, and 440\u20132700 keV and\nsubtract from the >30, >100 keV and >300 keV electron\nflux, respectively.\n[56] As a final check, Figure 8 shows the integrated pre-\ncipitating proton flux in the p2 and p3 channels for three\nlevels of geomagnetic activity corresponding to Figure 1.\nWe note that the flux has a different MLT distribution to the\nelectron precipitation shown in Figure 1 and even, for active\nconditions, the peak average proton precipitation flux is up\nto 2 orders of magnitude less than the peak average electron\nprecipitation flux. We therefore conclude that after sub-\ntracting the proton contamination the error introduced into\nthe electron flux in Figure 1 is small.\nAppendix B: Confidence Intervals for Correlation\nAnalysis\n[57] In order to quantify whether Pearson correlation\nvalues can be considered as significant or not, we calculate\npercentage confidence intervals for each correlation coeffi-\ncient. Significant correlations are generally considered to\nFigure 7.

Then we\ndetermine whether each Pearson coefficient was equal to or\nexceeded the 90%, 95%, 97.5% or 100% confidence interval\nusing look\u2010up tables of critical two\u2010tailed values of t for\nthese confidence intervals.We plot minimum confidence levels\n(only for confidence levels of at least 90%) in Figures 4b\nand 5b.\n[58] Acknowledgments.
