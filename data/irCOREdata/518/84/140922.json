A MAV is defined as a semiautonomous airborne vehicle, measuring less than 15 cm in\nany dimension, weighing no more than 140 grams, which can fly up to 2 hours for a range of 10 km\n[1]. As demonstrated by flying birds and insects, flapping flight is advantageous for its superior\nmanoeuvrability and lifting capability at low flight speeds [3,4]. Flapping wing systems as inspired\nby insect flight generally involve the wing completing pitching, yawing and sweeping components of\nmotion over a flapping cycle [5]. Different mechanisms such as pneumatic and motor-driven\nactuators have been applied to mimic this complex flapping motion, but these mechanisms often\nsuffer from heavy weight and mechanical system complexity [5].\nPiezoelectric materials especially lead zircornate titanate (PZT) are widely used in smart structures\nas sensors and actuators due to their high bandwidth, high output force, compact size, and high\npower density [6]. However, the piezoelectric effect is intrinsically very small and only a small\ndeflection can be expected directly from the bending piezoelectric unimorph\/bimorph. Therefore\nsome kind of motion amplification mechanisms are required to achieve large deflection. Fearing et\nal. developed piezoelectrically actuated four-bar mechanisms for micromechanical flying insect\nthorax. [7-9] Cox et al. reported three piezoelectrically activated four bar and five bar linkage\nsystems for the electromechanical emulation of mesoscale flapping flight. [10] Park et al. developed\na four bar linkage system driven by lightweight piezo-composite actuator to mimicking the flapping\nwing system of insects. [11]\n3A simpler motion amplification mechanism is a piezoelectric fan (piezofan) which couples a\npiezoelectric unimorph to an attached flexible blade and is capable of producing large deflections\nespecially at resonance. Piezofans were first investigated in the late seventies [12]. In the last a few\nyears the demand for portable electronic devices has brought interest in the use of piezofans as a\ncompact, low power, noiseless air cooling technology for applications such as laptop computers and\nDVD players etc. [13,14] We have investigated the optimization and characterization of individual\npiezofan structure at quasi-static and dynamic operations in a separate report [15]. In this paper we\nreport the investigation on using two coupled piezofans in parallel driven by sinusoidal voltages with\ndifferent phase delays between them to realise the flapping and twisting movements of the wing\nstructure. The main purpose of using piezofan as actuators is to facilitate this simple actuation\nmechanism to obtain two degree of freedom motion (2DOF), namely the flapping and twisting, of\nthe wing and to develop methods for the control of its 2DOF motion. The experimental and finite\nelement analysis and the effect of phase delay to the flapping and twisting of the wings attached to\nthe coupled piezofans will be presented.\n2 Experimental\nPiezofans were prepared by bonding together a stainless steel metal shim with a piezoelectric PZT\npatch using epoxy glue EPOTEK 301-2 (Epoxy Technology, US). The PZT wafers (PSI-5H4E) and\nstainless steel foils (Fe\/Cr15\/Ni7\/Mo2.25) were purchased from commercial sources [15]. The\nschematic set up for the 2 DOF motion is shown in Fig. 1. The two piezoelectric fans were of the\nunimorph type, with the PZT patch of the dimensions 30mm x 10mm x 127 \u03bcm, and the elastic\nstainless steel layer of the dimensions 43mm x 10mm x 125 \u03bcm, so the total length of the\npiezoelectric fan was 43 mm. A 3 mm gap existed between the clamping and the start of the PZT\npatch in order to prevent the ceramic layer from broken during vibration. A pair of spars made of\n4carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) connected with a flexible polymer skin formed the wing and\nthe wing was attached to the two piezoelectric fans clamped in parallel to form the coupled fans. The\ngap between the two fans, therefore also the gap between the two spars, was varied from 10 mm to 2\nmm.\nThe same wave (usually sinusoidal) signal from a function generator was split and supplied to two\nhigh voltage amplifiers. One of the split signals was then amplified and applied to one piezofan\ndirectly whilst the second signal was connected to an in-house made phase delay circuit (which can\nachieve 0 to 180 degree phase delay) before being connected to the other amplifier and then the other\npiezofan. The piezofans were clamped perpendicularly in parallel and both the flapping and twisting\nmotions are in the horizontal direction. This enabled a high speed camera (Photron APX) fixed\nabove the piezofans to record both the flapping the twisting motions of the wing. A frame rate of\n2000 frames\/s was used with an area of interest of 61.25mm x 61.25mm, which corresponded to a\nmean resolution of 67 \u00b5m per pixel. The camera was controlled by a computer system to record one\nsecond of data corresponding to 2000 images. The 2000 images covered several full cycles of the\nvibration (the frequency was usually between 10 to 100 Hz). The displacement data was then\nobtained by comparing images over a full cycle and directly analysing the image showing the largest\ndisplacement. ANSYS finite element modelling (FEM) was used to model the behaviours of the\ncoupled piezofans and the wing attached to it.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Characterization of the dynamic motions for the coupled piezofans\n5Fig. 2 shows the results of the FEM modal analysis. The first mode was pure bending or flapping, at\n23.7 Hz (a). The second mode was pure twisting (b), at 58 Hz and the third mode contained both\nbending and twisting at 62.9 Hz. The material parameters used in the FEM are listed in Table I.\nFigure 3 shows typical pictures produced by superimposing two high speed camera images of the\ntwo extreme positions of the wing within a vibration cycle, without any phase delay between the two\ninput voltages 170 Vpp at frequencies (a) 22.3 and (b) 47.4 Hz. Both the flapping and twisting\nmotion of the wing were obtained. It was found that the flapping displacement was peaked at 20 mm\nat the frequency 22.3.Hz. The twisting motion was found peaked at 16\u00ba at the frequency 47.4 Hz.\nFigure 4 shows the flapping and twisting amplitudes as functions of frequency for the wing. The\nquantitative discrepancy on the mode frequencies between the FEM modelled and actually measured\nvalues could be contributed to a number of factors. These include the uncertainty of the Young\u2019s\nmodulus for the CFRB spars and the polymer skin used in the FEA modelling, the non-perfect\nclamping at the foot of the piezofans, and probably most importantly the unmatched piezofans to\ndrive the wing. A number of these factors will now be discussed in more detail.\n(1) Unmatched piezofans: for the system shown in figure 1, if piezofan I and II were identical,\nwith no phase difference between the two input signals (i.e. phase delay = 0), the two piezofans\nwould be expected to vibrate in parallel at around the first resonant frequency. However, for many\nreasons it is not possible to have two identical piezofans in terms of their resonant frequencies and\nvibration amplitudes. As every piezofan is produced individually, any difference in the width and\nlength of the PZT patch and the stainless steel shim, the relative position of the PZT patch on the\nmetal shim, and the exact clamping conditions etc, all can lead to the variation of the resonant\nfrequency and amplitude. Furthermore, the vibration amplitude also depends on the exact\npiezoelectric coefficient of the PZT patch and the condition of the bonding layer, as well as the\n6geometrical factors. This means that, at any frequency, even at phase delay=0, the two piezofans may\nnot vibrate in parallel, or one may vibrate with a larger amplitude than the other. This will show an\napparent twisting motion for the wing. Since, around the first resonant frequency, the flapping\ndisplacement is at a maximum this mismatch in piezofan displacement appears to be at its greatest.\nFor this reason, the spread of the measurement data of the twisting motion around the first resonant\nfrequencies is expected to be the largest, as confirmed by measurements (Figure 4). The effect of\ndifferent resonant frequency on the flapping motion of the wing was found to be much smaller, as\nshown in Figure 4, where the flapping motion around the second resonance was smaller relative to\nthe flapping motion at the first resonant frequency.\n(2) Stiffness of the wing skin materials: the flapping and the twisting motions of the wing also\ndepend very much on the stiffness of the wing skin material, as well as the piezofan actuators. We\nconsider two extreme cases here: (i) If the skin material is infinitely soft (the stiffness coefficient\ncij=0), the whole system as shown in Figure 1 will act like two independent piezofans. At any\nfrequency, the two piezofans will vibrate in parallel when the phase-delay = 0 and in anti-phase\nwhen the phase-delay = 180 \u00ba. The flapping amplitude will be at its maximum when the phase-delay\n= 0 and reduce to zero when the phase-delay = 180 \u00ba, and the twisting motion will be at its maximum\nwhen the phase-delay = 180\u00ba and reduce to zero when the phase-delay = 0. Changing the phase-\ndelay will change the flapping and twisting amplitudes of the wing. However, if there is a difference\nof the 1st resonant frequencies f1 and f2 of the two piezofans, the flapping and apparent twisting will\ndepend on the operating frequency f and the value of f2- f1. (ii) If the skin material is infinitely stiff\n(the compliance coefficients sij=0), then the whole system must be treated as a single body and it has\nits unique resonant frequencies, the first mode being bending and the second mode being twisting. In\nthis case, the resonant frequency of the individual actuator piezofan I and II or the difference\nbetween the two will have a limited effect on the performance of the wing. In fact, the actual wing\n7will be between the above two extremes, with a finite stiffness coefficients cij>0. The system has its\nunique bending and twisting mode resonance frequencies but the performance could be affected by\nthe difference in resonant frequencies of the individual piezofan actuators. Every effort was made to\nfabricate the piezofans as identical as possible. The effect of different skin materials is a subject for\nfurther study. It is expected that a thin and light but stiff material--like an insect wing, is the best.\n3.2 Two DOF motion control by phase differentiated drive\nFigure 5 illustrates measurement results of (a) the flapping and (b) twisting vibration amplitudes of\nthe wing as functions of operating frequency under two input voltages 170 Vpp with different phase\ndelays between them. The gap between the two piezofans was 10 cm. It can be observed that the\nflapping motion had a resonance at around 22 Hz, and the vibration amplitude was the largest at\nphase-delay = 0 and reduced with the increasing phase-delay. The amplitude reached a minimum\nwhen the phase-delay equalled 180\u00ba, about a quarter of the value at the phase-delay = 0. The twisting\nmotion peaked around 49 Hz, and, contrary to the flapping, its amplitude increased with the\nincreasing phase-delay. The twisting amplitude for the phase-delay = 0 was about half of the value\nfor the phase-delay = 180\u00ba. However, as discussed in the last section, the amplitude mismatch\ngenerated twisting movement was significant for the frequencies near the flapping resonance, when\nthere was inevitably a difference of the resonant frequency between the two piezofans. The slight\nincrease of the flapping motion around the frequency 50 Hz may also due to the increase of the\namplitude mismatch around the twisting resonance there.\nFigures 5 shows that it is possible to change both the flapping and twisting motions of the flapping\nwing simply by varying the phase-delay between the two input signals. At frequencies around the 1st\nresonance, i.e. the flapping mode resonance, increasing the phase-delay from 0 to 180\u00ba lead to the\nreduced flapping motion. At frequencies around the 2nd resonance, i.e. the twisting mode resonance,\n8increasing the phase-delay from 0 to 180\u00ba lead to increased twisting motion. However, due to the\ndifficulty in obtaining matched piezofan actuators, it is not clear from this study what are the effects\nof changing phase-delay on the twisting motion around the flapping resonant frequency, and the\neffects on the flapping motion around the twisting resonant frequency. Nevertheless, the flapping at\nfrequencies far away from the flapping resonance was found to be insignificant.\n93.3 The effect of the gap distance between the two piezofans\nThe effect of the distance between the two piezofan actuators on the flapping and twisting motions\nof the wing was also investigated. Both the flapping and twisting were recorded at their respective\nresonant frequencies. For example, the flapping were measured at 26.2, 26.3, 26.0 and 26.2 Hz for\ngap distances 10, 8, 5 and 2 mm, respectively; and the twist angles were measured at 53.6, 49.1,\n51.4 and 47.4 Hz for gap distances 10, 8, 5 and 2 mm, respectively. Changing the gap distance\ninvolves de-clamping at least one of the piezofan, varying the distance between the two piezofans,\nand then re-clamping the piezofans. These results show that the flapping resonant frequency of the\nsystem changed a small amount (e.g. from 26.0 to 26.3 Hz) after these manoeuvres, but noticeable\ndifference in twisting resonant frequencies (from 47.4 to 53.6 Hz) resulted. However, these changes\nwere not monotonic with the change of the gap distance and were therefore most likely to be due to\nthe change of the effective clamping distances in the re-clamping, which leads to the change of the\nresonant frequency of the piezofan, as discussed before.\nFigure 6 shows the measured phase delay dependence of (a) the bending displacement and (b) the\ntwisting angle for the same system. The measured values were represented by symbols \uf0a8, \u25a1, \u25b2, \nand x and their corresponding polynomial fittings by solid, dashed, dotted, dash and dotted curves\nfor the gap equals to 10, 8, 5 and 2 mm respectively. The effect of the gap distance between the two\nfans was also investigated and results were also shown in the figure. When the gap distance was 10\nmm and the voltages Vpp=170 V applied to the two piezoelectric fans were in phase (phase delay =\n0\u00ba), the amplitude of the bending movement of the wing reached 23.4 mm and resonated at 26.2 Hz.\nIf the phase delay of the two driving voltages was increased and all the other conditions remained\nthe same, the mode of the wing movement remained the pure bending and also resonated at the\nsame frequency, but with a reduced amplitude. In addition, if the two driving voltages were anti-\n10\nparallel (phase delay = 180\u00ba), the amplitude of the resonant bending displacement was reduced to\nminimum of 1.8 mm. When the gap between the two wing spars was reduced from 10 mm to 8 mm\n(and further to 5 and 2 mm) and all the other conditions were kept the same, the bending\ndisplacement increased but the dependence on the phase delay was similar (Fig. 6a).\nIf the frequency of the two driving voltages was increased from 26.2 Hz to 53.6 Hz, the same as its\nsecond mode frequency, the wing motion became a pure twisting. In this case, the two wing spars as\nrepresented by point 1 and point 2 in Fig. 1 were always moving in the opposite directions with the\nmiddle line not moving. When the gap distance was 10 mm and the voltages Vpp=170 V applied to\nthe two piezofans were in phase (phase delay = 0\u00ba), the twisting angle of the wing was minute, close\nto 0 degree at 53.6 Hz. If the phase delay of the two driving voltage was increased and all the other\nconditions remained the same, the wing movement was found to remain at the pure twisting mode\nand also resonate at the same frequency, but with an increased twisting amplitude. For the case with\nthe two driving voltages set to anti-parallel (phase delay = 180\u00ba), the resonant twisting angle\nreached 41\u00ba (Fig. 6b). It was also found, if the gap between the two wing spars was reduced from 10\nmm to 8 mm (and further to 5 and 2 mm) and all the other conditions were kept the same, the wing\ntwisting increased but its dependence on the phase delay was similar (Fig. 6b).\nThe motional amplitude dependence on the gap distance between the two spars could be interpreted\nby consideration of the air damping effect. In this case, the damping of the wing movement would\nincrease in proportion to its cross sectional area where the effective cross section of the wing is\nproportional to the gap distance [16]. So the reduced gap distance would lead to a reduced\naerodynamic damping and hence an increased vibration amplitude. To this end, a nearly linear\nrelationship (with negative slump rates) was found to exist between both the bending and twisting\namplitudes and the gap distance (Fig. 7), further reinforcing this proposed damping dependency.\n11\n4 Conclusions\nCoupled piezoelectric fans were formed by clamping two fans in parallel and attaching a flexible\nwing made of two stiff carbon fibre reinforced plastic wing spars and a soft polymer skin. The\ndynamic behaviours of the wing were modelled by FEM modal analysis and investigated by using\nhigh speed digital cameras. It was found both the mode and the amplitude of the wing motion\ndepend strongly on frequency. The degrees of motion of the wing increased by nearly 10 times at\nresonant frequencies as compared to the motion at frequencies far away from the resonance. It was\nfound that the phase delay between the driving voltages supplied to the two coupled piezoelectric\nfans play a critical role in the control of the flapping and twisting motions of the wing. The bending\namplitude of the wing reduced with the increasing phase delay and the twisting movement increased\nwith an increasing phase delay.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was financially supported by the UK EPSRC Grant Flapping Wing MAV\nEP\/C511190\/1 and Platform Grant EP\/D506638\/1.
