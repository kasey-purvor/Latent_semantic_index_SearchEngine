In this\napproach, we developed methods to build the migration\nvelocity model and to perform 3D prestack Kirchhoff time\nmigration on a PC cluster and improved the processing\nflow for PS-converted waves. The technique was success-\nfully applied to a 3D\/4-C marine data set acquired in August\n2001 and made available to us by Kerr-McGee North Sea\n(UK).\nThis was a North Sea survey with a nominal receiver\narea of 10.8 km2. Two swath data sets were acquired. Each\nswath data set had an inline geometry using two receiver\ncables and 22 shot lines. The survey was centered on a\ndomed structure which is obscured by a gas chimney.\nFaulting is thought to be present beneath the summit of the\ndome. Because the P-waves are attenuated by gas clouds,\nthe P-wave image of the structure beneath the gas chimney\nis dimmed, but PS-converted waves can image that struc-\nture. In this study, we processed the PS-converted wave\ndata of the 3D\/4-C data set from one swath. The objective\nof the processing was to define the top of the structure at\nthe reservoir target level (3.0 s PP time and 5.5 s PS time).\nWe demonstrated how the PS-converted wave processing\nwas able to clarify structural details.\n3D prestack Kirchhoff time migration (PKTM) and an\nappropriate migration velocity model play a crucial role in\nimaging structures beneath gas clouds using PS-converted\nwaves. Firstly, we present the principle of 3D PKTM and its\nimplications for a PC cluster. Then we demonstrate how to\nbuild the migration velocity model. After that we show the\nresults of 2D processing of P- and PS-converted waves for\n2D lines at the location of receiver cables, and the results of\n3D processing of PS-converted waves for one swath data\nset. Finally, we present the interpretation results based on\nthe 3D migrated images and our conclusions.\nPrinciples of 3D PKTM. 3D PKTM can produce an image\nat any desired location in a 3D space. Figure 1 shows the\nrelationship among the scatterpoints (image points), shots,\nand receivers in 3D PKTM. The energy from a trace related\nto a shot and a receiver must be distributed to all possible\nscatterpoints in a surface according to the relevant travel-\ntime. In other words, the energy from all shots and receivers\nis summed at each location to construct an image of the scat-\nterpoints. This is usually implemented as a weighted sum-\nmation based on the raypaths.\nIn 3D PKTM, the traveltime of a PS-converted wave (tps)\nfor anisotropic media is calculated using the double-square-\nroot (DSR) equation derived by Li et al. (2001):\n(1)\nwhere xp is the horizontal distance from the source to the\nscatterpoint; xs is the horizontal distance from the scatter-\npoint to the receiver; tp0 is the vertical traveltime for the P-\nwave; ts0 is the vertical traveltime for the S-wave; VP is the\nvelocity for the P-wave, and VS is the velocity for the S-wave.\n\u03b7eff and \u03b6eff are anisotropy parameters for the P- and S-waves,\nrespectively. However, the offset between the source and\nreceiver does not equal xp + xs when the shot line and receiver\nline are not collinear.\nFor PS-converted waves, it is difficult to obtain VP and\nVS from field data directly because only tps can be measured.\nIt is not possible to separate tps into tp and ts. To overcome\nthis difficulty, other parameters constructed from the above\nparameters can be used. One set of the combined parame-\nters consists of the PS-converted wave velocity (VPS), the\neffective velocity ratio (\u03b3eff), and vertical velocity ratio (\u03b30).\nLi and Yuan (2003) recommend the parameter \u03c7 for describ-\ning the PS-converted wave anisotropy. The relationship\nbetween the two sets is defined as:\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\nEquation 7 is strictly true only for a single layer. However,\nwe find that it can also be used in multilayer media with-\nout losing accuracy. VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03c7 can be estimated from\nPS-converted waves alone using a data-driven approach, and\nImaging beneath gas clouds using 3D prestack Kirchhoff time\nmigration of PS-converted waves\u2014A case study from the North Sea\nHENGCHANG DAI and XIANG-YANG LI, British Geological Survey, Edinburgh, UK \nPAUL CONWAY, Kerr-McGee North Sea (UK), Aberdeen, UK \n522 THE LEADING EDGE APRIL 2007\nFigure 1. The relationship between shots, receivers, and scatterpoints\nin 3D PKTM. For a given traveltime and raypath, the scatterpoints are\non a surface in 3D space.\n\u03b30 can be estimated from the correlation between events in\nthe P-wave and PS-converted wave images. VP and VS are\nthen calculated from VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03b30; tp0 and ts0 are calcu-\nlated from \u03b30 and tc0; and \u03b7eff and \u03b6eff are calculated from \u03c7,\n\u03b3eff, and \u03b30. The advantage of using VPS and velocity ratios\ninstead of VP and VS in PKTM processing is that the travel-\ntime of the PS-converted wave is not sensitive to variations\nin the velocity ratios. The effect of velocity ratio error on the\nmoveout is much less than the effect of VPS error. In PS-con-\nverted wave data processing, the values of the velocity ratios\nobtained from stacking velocity analysis can be used in\nprestack time migration. Thus only the PS-converted-wave\nvelocity needs to be estimated precisely.\nIn 3D PKTM, the locations of scatterpoints form a 3D\nimage cube in the CIP (common image point) domain. The\ndata from all shots and receivers contribute to every image\npoint in this cube. However, a 3D\/4-C data set often con-\nsists of tens of shot lines. The output cube is often very large\nand exceeds the capacity of normal computers. It is diffi-\ncult to perform 3D PKTM for all shot lines in one run. To\novercome this, we split the 3D image cube into CIP lines.\nData from each pair of shot and receiver lines will con-\ntribute to any given CIP line (Figure 2) as a subimage of the\nCIP line. Then the 3D migrated image at the desired CIP\nline is the summation of all subimages obtained from all shot\ndata for all receivers. This process can be written:\n(8)\nwhere image(cipline) is the image at the location of one CIP\nline in the 3D cube and subimage (cipline, shot, rec) is the\nimage at the location of the CIP line obtained from data\nrelated to a pair of shot and receiver lines. The task of pro-\ncessing one subimage using 3D PKTM is defined as the basic\nprocessing unit, which runs on a PC cluster to speed up the\nprocessing. This approach has several advantages. Because\neach basic processing unit produces only one subimage\n(cipline, shot, rec) from one pair of shot and receiver lines,\nthis task can run at any time on any computer. The migrated\nsubimage (cipline, shot, rec) is then stored on the disk for\nthe final summation. Because the basic processing units are\nindependent of each other, failure of one basic processing\nunit does not affect others. The cost of rerunning one basic\nprocessing unit is small. Therefore, the whole job can be con-\nveniently scheduled, and the process is stable and robust.\nAPRIL 2007 THE LEADING EDGE 523\nFigure 2.

Profile of \u03b30 at the location of CIP line 050.\nMigration velocity model estimation. An appropriate\nmigration velocity model is critical for producing high-qual-\nity migrated images using PKTM. For PS-converted waves,\na migration velocity model consists of VPS, \u03b3eff, \u03b30, and \u03c7.\nThree steps are necessary to construct the velocity model\nfor PKTM: (1) estimate \u03b30 by correlating events in the P-wave\nand PS-converted wave stacked sections or migrated images;\n(2) estimate the stacking velocity model (VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03c7)\nbased on the nonhyperbolic anisotropic moveout analysis\nof the ACP (asymptotic-conversion-point) gathers of PS-\nconverted waves; and (3) update the estimated stacking\nvelocity model based on the hyperbolic moveout analysis\nof the inverted NMO-CIP gathers of PS-converted waves.\nOften VPS is the only parameter that needs to be updated\nfor PKTM. The stacking \u03b3eff, \u03b30, and \u03c7 are set in the migra-\ntion velocity model. Note that both the stacking velocity\nmodel and the migration velocity model are rms velocity\nmodels which are related to one CIP location. In 2D PKTM,\nall raypaths related to this CIP location have the same\nazimuth. However, in 3D PKTM, raypaths related to this CIP\nlocation have various azimuths. If azimuthal anisotropy is\npresent, the migration velocity model should vary with\nazimuthal changes. If the variation is small, we may treat\nthe migration velocity model as isotropic in azimuth.\nThe software used in this paper is CXTools as described\nin Dai (2003) and Dai and Li (2003).\n524 THE LEADING EDGE APRIL 2007\nFigure 6.

Stacked section (a) and migrated image (b) of PS-converted waves displayed in PP time at receiver line 5002.\nStacking velocity model estimation. Estimating the stack-\ning velocity model is a typical 2D processing procedure and\nis only carried out on two 2D lines at the locations of CIP\nlines 050 (at receiver line 5002) and 070 (at receiver line\n5018) where the source line overlaps on the receiver line.\nThere are two steps: (1) estimating \u03b30 by correlating events\nin the brute-stacked P-wave and PS-converted wave sections;\n(2) estimating VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03c7 from an ACP gather of PS-con-\nverted waves. Figure 3 shows examples of estimated \u03b30 and\nthe corresponding P-wave and PS-converted wave sections\nat the location of CIP line 050. The left panel in Figure 3 is\nthe P-wave section, and the right panel is the PS-converted\nwave section. The middle panel gives the estimated values\nof \u03b30 at CDP 400. Using the values of \u03b30, we can convert the\nvertical traveltime of the PS-converted wave section to PP\ntime. Figure 4 shows the converted-wave results. The events\nin the PS-converted wave section are well matched with the\nevents in the P-wave section. Figure 5 shows the profile of\n\u03b30 for this CIP line. Since the values of \u03b30 are not sensitive\nin the time processing, we apply the values to all locations\nin this data set.\nOnce \u03b30 is estimated, we estimate VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03c7 from\nACP gathers of PS-converted waves. Figure 6 shows an\nexample of the stacking velocity model and the corre-\nsponding ACP gather at the location of CDP 350 of receiver\nline 5002 (CIP line 050). The left panel shows the nonhy-\nperbolic spectrum obtained from the ACP gather, and the\nblue line indicates the velocity values. The second panel\nshows the spectrum of \u03b3eff and the values of \u03b30 and \u03b3eff ; the\nthird panel shows \u03c7. The right panel shows the ACP gather.\nNote that we can flatten the events in the ACP gathers by\nsetting \u03c7 = 0 for both cases. This implies that either there is\nno VTI anisotropy or it is too small to be estimated.\nMigration velocity model updating. Once the stacking\nvelocity model is estimated, we use it as the initial migra-\ntion velocity model in PKTM and update it. The updating\nis based on a hyperbolic moveout analysis on the inverted\nNMO-CIP gather obtained from PKTM, which is performed\nto produce a CIP gather using the initial stacking velocity\nmodel. The CIP gather is then inverted using the hyperbolic\nmoveout with the initial velocity. A hyperbolic moveout\nanalysis is applied to this inverted NMO-CIP gather to pro-\nduce a velocity spectrum which can be used to update the\nvelocity model.\nFigure 7 shows an example of the migration velocity\nmodel and the corresponding CIP gather at the location CIP\n350 of CIP line 050 from the data of shot line 5002 and\nreceiver line 5002; these lines are collinear. Comparing\nFigures 7 and 6, we find that the events in Figure 7 are\nclearer and more focused than those in Figure 6. The veloc-\nity ratios \u03b30 and \u03b3eff in the migration velocity model (Figure\n7) are taken from the stacking velocity model (Figure 6)\nwithout any updating. As in Figure 6, anisotropy parame-\nter \u03c7 is set to zero. Note that in both figures, the events in\nthe CIP gather are flattened with the anisotropy parameter\n\u03c7 = 0. This indicates that any VTI anisotropy in this data set\nis very small and can be neglected.\nAzimuthal anisotropy. To examine the azimuthal anisotropy\nin the migration velocity model, we apply the updated\nmigration velocity model at CIP line 050 to the data obtained\nfrom shot line 5018 and receiver line 5002. Shot line 5018 is\n500 m from receiver line 5002. Figure 8 shows a CIP gather\nobtained using the updated velocity model at CIP 350 of CIP\nline 050. The raypath in this CIP gather is different from that\nfor the CIP gather in Figure 7. The raypath for the CIP gather\nin Figure 7 has only one azimuth. However, the raypath for\nthe CIP gather in Figure 8 has a wide range of azimuths. If\nazimuthal anisotropy is present, the migration velocity mod-\nels for the two CIP gathers should be different. However,\nusing the same updated migration velocity model, we can\nflatten the events in both CIP gathers. This means that,\nalthough the raypaths of PS-converted waves at this loca-\ntion from two shot lines are different, the velocity models\nare the same which, in turn, implies that the velocity model\nis azimuthally independent as well as spatially consistent.\nWe tested the migration velocity model at various loca-\ntions for data from different shot and receiver lines. All results\nshow that the azimuthal (HTI) anisotropy in this data set is\nsmall and can be neglected. This means that the migration\nvelocity model in this area is isotropic and varies only with\nCIP location. Thus, only VPS, \u03b3eff, and \u03b30 need to be estimated\nfrom the data. Due to the azimuthal independence of the\nvelocity model and the assumption of CIP-consistency, the\nvelocity model at any CIP location can be estimated from sin-\ngle shot-line data. This saves a lot of processing time. Figures\n9 and 10 show the profiles of VPS and \u03b3eff at the location of\nCIP line 050. Once the migration velocity models at the CIP\nlocations have been estimated, the 3D PKTM can be per-\nformed for all data sets using the updated velocity model.\n526 THE LEADING EDGE APRIL 2007\nFigure 13. External display of the 3D cube of the migrated image. \nFigure 14. An internal display of the 3D cube of the migrated image.\nResults of 2D processing. The data for 2D processing are\nfrom two shot lines. The locations of the shot lines are\ndirectly over the receiver cables (cables 5002 and 5018). They\ncan therefore be treated as two 2D lines. 3D PKTM is reduced\nto 2D PKTM when the desired output line, source line, and\nreceiver line are collinear. For one 2D line, we processed the\nP-wave data first. Figure 11 shows the stacked P-wave sec-\ntion and the migrated P-wave image at the location of\nreceiver line 5002. In Figure 11, one can see that the image\nof the targets at about 3 s between CDP 400 and 600 has dis-\nappeared due to the gas clouds above them (between 1 and\n2 s). Although the overall structure in the migrated image\nis clearer than that in the stacked section, the targets beneath\nthe gas clouds still cannot be seen in the\nmigrated image. \nHowever, the image obtained from\nPS-converted waves displays the struc-\nture beneath the gas clouds. Figure 12\nshows the stacked PS-converted wave sec-\ntion and the migrated PS-converted wave\nimage in PP time at the location of receiver\nline 5002. The target beneath the gas\nclouds is faintly visible in the stacked PS-\nconverted wave section (Figure 12a). It is\nmore clearly seen in the migrated PS-con-\nverted wave image (Figure 12b). This is\nbecause, if the raypath of the downgoing\nP-wave is outside the gas cloud and the\nraypath of the upgoing converted S-wave\nis inside the gas cloud, we can observe the\nsignal of the PS-converted wave at the\nreceiver. The quality of the migrated PS-\nconverted wave image is much better than\nthe stacked PS-converted wave section\nand migrated P-wave image. The migra-\nted PS-converted wave image at around\n3 s in PP-time clearly shows the structure\nof interest with faulting at the dome be-\nneath the gas cloud. The details of the\nfaults in the target can be clearly identi-\nfied in the migrated PS-converted wave\nimage. However, these cannot be seen in\nthe migrated P-wave image and stacked\nPS-converted wave section. This clearly\nshows the advantages of applying PKTM\nto PS-converted waves to image the struc-\nture beneath the gas cloud. \nResults of 3D processing. 3D processing\nwas applied to one swath of the data set,\nconsisting of 22 shot lines. The signals\nfrom each shot line were recorded on two\nreceiver cables. At one CIP line location,\nwe can obtain a migrated image (subim-\nage) from every shot line and one of two\nreceiver cable lines. This migrated image\ncontributes the final image at this CIP line\nlocation. The final image at each CIP line\nis the summation of 44 subimages ob-\ntained from 22 shot lines and two receiver\nlines. To produce these subimages, we\nperformed 3D PKTM at the location of\nevery CIP line for every pair of shot and\nreceiver cable lines.\nPKTM is computationally intensive.\nFor example, it takes 16 hours to produce\none subimage on a Sun workstation or a\nLinux PC. Because the final 3D image consists of 60 CIP lines,\nwe would need 960 hours (40 days) to migrate one shot line\ndata and 42 240 hours (1760 days) to migrate one suite of\nswath data. These timescales are not practical. To speed up\nthis migration procedure, we perform the 3D PKTM on a\nPC cluster. The details of the parallel 3D PKTM on the PC\ncluster can be found in Dai (2005). Using 16 CPUs, we can\nproduce one subimage in one hour. The total time for migrat-\ning data from one shot line data and one receiver line is 60\nhours, and the total time for migrating one suite of swath\ndata is 2640 hours (110 days). After data from all 22 shot\nlines and two receiver lines are processed, we sum the\nsubimages of PS-converted waves at the locations of each\n528 THE LEADING EDGE APRIL 2007\nFigure 15. (a) Inline projection at CIP line 050 and (b) crossline projection at CIP 500 from\nthe 3D cube of the migrated image.\nFigure 16. A comparison between the PS-converted wave results (displayed in PP time)\nobtained using the PKTM approach (upper figure) and by conventional time processing\n(ACP, NMO, DMO stacking, postmigration) (lower figure). Drilling locations are marked\non both images (black lines).\nCIP line. The summed images form a 3D image cube of the\nPS-converted waves. Figures 13 and 14 show the 3D cube.\nFigure 15 shows the projections of the images at CIP lines\n050 and CIP 500.\nAt the top of the cross-section, the upside down \u201cw\u201d\nshape is caused by the aperture control that applies the mut-\ning to the images. The migrated image has two peaks at the\nlocation of receiver lines 5002 and 5018, where the images\nhave the strongest energies. The energy variation affects the\nimage most at shallow depths (between 0 and 3 s in PS time).\nThe difference in the curves can be clearly observed in the\nmigrated images. This uneven distribution of energies at the\nlocations between receiver lines may lead to the appearance\nof false structures in the images. Using more receiver lines\nmay overcome this problem. The energy variation is smaller\nfor the images in the deep part. Note that the consistency\nof images at times between 5 and 6 s shows that the struc-\ntures are not related to the locations of the receiver lines.\nThat means that this spacing of receiver lines is adequate to\nimage deep structures.\nComparing the 3D migrated images with the 2D migrated\nimages (Figures 12b and 15a), we find that although the tar-\ngets in the 2D image and 3D image at the same locations have\nsimilar features, the details of the target are a little different.\nFor example, at the location of CIP line 050, the target in both\nimages at around 5.5 s in PS-time shows faulting at the dome\nbeneath the gas cloud. However, the targets in the 3D image\nare smoother and more continuous than that in the 2D image,\nand the signal-to-noise ratio is higher in the 3D image than\nthat in the 2D image. The same improvement in the 3D\nimages can be found for other CIP lines.\nDrilling results. The structure in the 3D migrated images\nhas been confirmed by drilling at this area. Figure 16 shows\none example of the comparison between the images obtained\nby our PKTM approach and by conventional PS-time pro-\ncessing (ACP, NMO, DMO, stacking, postmigration). Wells\nand interpreted horizons are marked on both images. In the\nimage obtained from conventional processing (the lower plot\nin Figure 16), we cannot see faults. However, the PKTM\nresult clearly shows the structure with dome faulting which\nis confirmed by drilling.\nConclusions. In this paper, we have developed a practical\napproach to performing 3D PKTM and applied this approach\nto processing PS-converted waves in a 3D\/4-C data set from\nthe North Sea. There are two key elements in this process-\ning. One is to build the migration velocity model and the\nother is to perform the parallel 3D-PKTM in a PC cluster.\nTwo steps are involved in building the velocity model\u2014esti-\nmating the stacking velocity model and updating the veloc-\nity model for migration. The results obtained from both the\nstacking velocity model and migration velocity model show\nthat neither VTI nor HTI anisotropy can be observed in this\ndata set. An isotropic and CIP-consistent velocity model is\ntherefore sufficient for image processing.\nThe processing results obtained from two 2D lines, where\nthe shot line overlies the receiver cable line, show that PS-\nconverted waves do have advantages over P-waves in imag-\ning structures beneath gas clouds. To migrate the 3D data\nset, a scheme is specially designed to divide the whole job\ninto subjobs that can independently perform 3D PKTM for\na 2D line data. Each subjob is then performed by running a\nparallel version of the 3D PKTM on a PC cluster to speed\nup the migration processing. This 3D PKTM approach is effi-\ncient and robust. The processing results from 3D PKTM are\nencouraging and reveal the structure of the targets in greater\ndetail. The structure beneath the gas clouds is clearly imaged\nusing PS-converted waves with 3D PKTM. Faulting in the\ntarget area can be clearly identified in the migrated images.\nThese structures have been confirmed by drilling.\nSuggested reading. \u201cParallel processing of prestack Kirchhoff\ntime migration on a Beowulf cluster\u201d by Dai (Computers and\nGeosciences, 2005). \u201cIntegrative analysis of anisotropy parame-\nter and velocities for PS converted waves\u201d by Dai (SEG 2003\nExpanded Abstracts). \u201cMigration velocity analysis of PS-wave\nusing INMO-CIP gathers of PKTM: A case study from the Gulf\nof Mexico\u201d by Dai and Li (EAGE 2003 Extended Abstracts). \u201cThe\neffects of migration velocity errors on traveltime accuracy and\nthe image of PS converted waves\u201d by Dai and Li (GEOPHYSICS,\n2006). \u201cAnisotropy migration and model building for 4C seis-\nmic data: A case study from Alba\u201d by Dai and Li (SEG 2001\nExpanded Abstracts). \u201cImaging through gas-filled sediments\nusing marine shear-wave data\u201d by Granli et al.
