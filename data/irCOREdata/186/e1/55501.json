Introduction\n[2] The Antarctic Peninsula has been a region of rapid\nrecent climate change [Vaughan et al., 2003]. However,\nthere is a paucity of long term meteorological observations\nof temperature across the Antarctica Peninsula. Records of\nthe stable isotope composition of oxygen and hydrogen in\nice (for brevity we refer to either isotopic record equiva-\nlently hereafter as d), can potentially help to fill this gap\n[Thompson et al., 1994; Mulvaney et al., 2002; Schneider et\nal., 2006]. This is because, where air parcels travel in\nisolation, d in precipitation is controlled by temperature\ndifferences between the evaporation and condensation sites\n[Dansgaard, 1964; Jouzel et al., 1997]. Where evaporation\nsite temperature remains approximately constant, which\nseems likely for centennial length studies in the Antarctic\nvicinity [Schneider et al., 2006], d in precipitation is then\ndependent on the condensation temperature [Dansgaard,\n1964]. The individual air parcel model is a simplification,\nsince more complex changes in the mixing of different air\nparcels can also affect d [e.g., Noone, 2008]. However,\nusing a full isotopically enabled general circulation model\nto simulate a forced warming event, large-scale geograph-\nical variability in d changes across Antarctica have been\nshown to be mainly dependent on local changes in conden-\nsation temperature [Sime et al., 2008].\n[3] We use ECMWF ERA40 [Uppala et al., 2005] data to\nexamine how local Peninsula changes in the relationship\nbetween temperature during precipitation events (condensa-\ntion temperature) and mean temperature are dependent on\nmodifications of mean Southern Hemisphere atmospheric\nflow [e.g., Comiso, 2000; Marshall, 2003], and associated\nchanges in synoptic scale activity [e.g., Lubin et al., 2008].\nWe show that sensitivity across the Peninsula differs from\nsite to site, and this strongly influences how temperature\nchanges can be recorded in d at each Peninsula ice core site.\n2. Data and Methods\n[4] We explore the potential impact of changes in the\nrelationship between temperature during precipitation events\n(condensation temperature) and mean temperature by exam-\nining the covariance between temperature and precipitation\non Peninsula ice cores using 22 years (1980\u20132002) of\nECMWF ERA40 surface air temperature (T), precipitation\n(P), and accumulation (PE - precipitation minus evaporation)\ndata. The ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis is considered more\naccurate than NCAR-NCEP output for Antarctica [Marshall,\n2003; Bromwich and Fogt, 2004], and reliable for both\ntemperature and precipitation across the majority of Penin-\nsula from 1980 onwards [Miles et al., 2008;Marshall, 2009].\n[5] The effect of covariance between temperature and\nprecipitation (and accumulation) on the recorded ice core\ntemperature can be investigated by calculating the temper-\nature during precipitation events:\nTP \u00bc T d\u00f0 \u00deP d\u00f0 \u00de\nP d\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere T(d) is daily temperature (d is time in daily\nincrements), and P(d) is daily precipitation. We can split T\nand P into mean and fluctuating parts, so that T(d) = T d\u00f0 \u00de +\nTsynop(d) + Tseas(d) + Tannual(d), and P(d) = P d\u00f0 \u00de + Psynop(d) +\nPseas(d) + Pannual(d). For the example of temperature,\nTsynop(d) are the fluctuations in T at periods of higher\nfrequency than 60 days (synoptic); Tseas(d) are fluctuations\nof between 60 and 375 day period (seasonal); and Tannual(d)\nis remanent low pass variability at periods longer than\n375 days. We can expand equation 1 to obtain:\nTP \u00bc T \u00fe BsynopP \u00fe BseasP \u00fe BannualP ; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere the synoptic and seasonal B terms are:\nB\nsynop\nP \u00bc\nTsynop d\u00f0 \u00dePsynop d\u00f0 \u00de\nP d\u00f0 \u00de ;B\nseas\nP \u00bc\nTseas d\u00f0 \u00dePseas d\u00f0 \u00de\nP d\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f03\u00de\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L18801, doi:10.1029\/2009GL038982, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL038982$05.00\nL18801 1 of 5\nThese B terms contain information about biasing in the\nrecorded temperature TP, as opposed to the surface\ntemperature T, due to correlations between T and P\nfluctuations at synoptic and seasonal frequencies [Sime et\nal., 2008]. Note because site location (x, y) appears in\nevery term, it is omitted from all equations.\n[6] Peninsula core sites have high accumulation rates and\ndistinct annual cycles in various elements and chemical\nspecies [Thomas et al., 2008; Miles et al., 2008]. This\nallows individual annual layers to be identified in the ice\ncores, i.e., \u2018layer counting\u2019 [Thompson et al., 1994; Thomas\net al., 2008]. Annual layer counting simplifies the recon-\nstruction of annual mean temperatures because annual mean\nd can be obtained for every individual year, regardless of\nany variations in the annual accumulation amount. Howev-\ner, biasing due to synoptic (BP\nsynop) and seasonal (BP\nseas)\ncovariance will affect the annual mean d. We therefore\ndefine annual mean temperature: T(a) = T d\u00f0 \u00de, where a is\ntime in annual increments for each Peninsula location and\nover whole (summer to summer) years between 1980 and\n2002. Following that convention, the biasing terms BP\nseas(a)\nand BP\nsynop(a) are calculated using 365 day sets of frequency\nfiltered T and P. Using the definitions in equations 2 and 3,\nannual mean precipitation biased temperature is TP(a) =\nT(a) + BP\nsynop(a) + BP\nseas(a). Likewise temperature biased by\nonly synoptic covariance is T(a) + BP\nsynop(a), or equivalently\nfor seasonal covariance it is T(a) + BP\nseas(a).\n[7] Because d in ice-core is accumulation, rather than\npurely precipitation, derived we also carry out the same\ncalculations using accumulation (PE) to obtain BPE and TPE\nterms. The effect of wind redistribution of snow on accu-\nmulation is not included in ERA40 but is thought to be\nmostly small: 6% of precipitation across the Peninsula [van\nLipzig et al., 2004]. Additionally, BPE and TPE ignore\naccumulation history, thus any time delays between precip-\nitation and evaporation. However, this omission will have a\nlimited impact on the accuracy of the calculations. Most\nbiasing across the Peninsula is induced by covariance of\ntemperature and precipitation rather than evaporation (see\nclose similarity of black and grey lines in Figure 1).\n[8] Neglecting any influence on d other than site temper-\nature during precipitation (accumulation), annual mean TP\n(TPE) and d in ice cores are directly equivalent. Variations in\nthe TP(a) against T(a) relationship can therefore be used to\nunderstand how annual mean precipitated d relates to annual\nmean temperature. Similarly, TPE represents the accumulat-\ned d record. Examining the relationships between T, TP, and\nTPE reveals how past Peninsula temperatures are recorded in\nthe ice core d records. We focus here on three Peninsula ice\ncore locations (see Figure 2a for locations): the Gomez,\nDyer, and James Ross Island (JRI) regions, which together\nspan the length of the Peninsula.\n3. Results\n[9] Temperature anomalies vary in magnitude across the\nPeninsula; but warm (and cold) years tend to coincide at all\nthree sites (Figure 1). The Gomez and Dyer regions both\nshow strong annual mean temperature variation (up to 6\u0001C\nvariation in T occurs at Dyer), while the JRI region shows\nmore subdued T variations (less than 3\u0001C). Despite the\ngeographic coherence in warm (and cold) years, tempera-\nture recorded in precipitation shows large variation between\nthe sites: TP explains at least 70% of the variance in T at\nGomez and Dyer, but only 42% at JRI, and the accumula-\ntion record explains 11% to 30% of the mean annual\ntemperature variation in the region of JRI (Figure 2c). This\nindicates substantial geographical differences in how annual\nFigure 1.

The explained variance (R2) between T and TP (and T and TPE) is given for each site, and R\n2 between the JRI values\nand the Esperanza observations are also given.\nL18801 SIME ET AL.: TEMPERATURE FROM PENINSULA ICE CORES L18801\n2 of 5\ntemperatures may be recorded in precipitation and accumu-\nlation, and hence annual mean d in ice cores.\n[10] The relationship between annual mean T and TPE\n(correlations and gradients) for each location in the Penin-\nsula region depicts the geographical structure in the tem-\nperature versus d relationship (Figure 2). In the northern and\neastern (JRI type) regions, synoptic covariance reduces the\ncorrelation and gradient of T versus TPE (Figure 2a, shading).\nIn the more southerly and westerly (Gomez type) regions\nseasonal covariance increases the gradients (Figure 2b,\nshading). This split is indicative of different accumulation\nregimes across the Peninsula. Synoptic precipitation events\ntend to be associated with positive temperature anomalies\n[Lubin et al., 2008]. This implies that in warmer (colder)\nyears, warm temperature fluctuations in the JRI region are\nassociated with drier (wetter) conditions, or equally that warm\n(cold) years have more (less) dry synoptic incursions of warm\nair. In the more southerly and westerly (Gomez type) regions\nseasonal covariance increases the gradients (Figure 2b,\nshading), implying that in warm (cold) years warm seasons\nin this region are associated with wetter (drier) conditions.\nFurther analysis (not shown) confirms that high accumula-\ntion years at Gomez tend to be 1 to 2\u0001C warmer across the\nPeninsula including JRI, but high accumulation years at JRI\ntend to be 1 to 2\u0001C cooler across the Peninsula: the cor-\nrelation between annual mean T and P at Gomez is 0.71\nwhilst at and JRI it is \u00050.11. These type of geographic\nvariations in P (and PE) and T covariance are associated with\nchanges in atmospheric circulation patterns round Antarctica\nand are also liable to explain geographical anticorrelation\nin annual accumulation [e.g., Comiso, 2000; Thomas et al.,\n2008].\n[11] Examination of the spatial correlation of accumula-\ntion (or precipitation) events at the two most distant Gomez\nand JRI regions, and the relationship between the events and\ntemperature and pressure anomalies, clarifies how circula-\ntion changes modify the ice core d record at each site.\n[12] Gomez synoptic accumulation events are associated\nwith strong warming across the Peninsula, particularly in\nthe region between Dyer and Gomez, and with a weaker\nwarming over the JRI region (Figure 3a, shading). The\nstorm track moves southwards and intensifies during these\nevents (Figure 3a, blue and red pressure anomaly contours).\nThe increased meridional pressure gradients cause warmer\nwetter air to be drawn from the north and west [Thomas et\nal., 2008]. This warms the Peninsula, and causes higher\nprecipitation over the western and southern Peninsula\n(Figure 3a, black contours). However, there is no precipi-\ntation associated with these events, despite warmer temper-\natures, across the east and north of the Peninsula. Instead,\nthere is some active drying associated with these conditions\nacross the east and north (Figure 3b, grey dashed contours).\nThus warming in the east and north due to this circulation\npattern is not likely to be recorded in local ice core d values.\nThis weakens the relationship between d in accumulation\nand temperature in the JRI region.\n[13] Synoptic accumulation events which contribute to\nthe JRI record tend to be more geographically restricted\nthan those at Gomez, and are associated with a smaller\namount of warming across the Peninsula (Figure 3d, black\ncontours and shading). They occur when pressure gradients\nare reduced across northern areas (Figure 3d, red and blue\ncontours) and warmer wetter air flows from the north east,\nindicated by a warmed region to the north east of JRI. The\nsynoptic events are associated with a cooling to the south\nand west of the Peninsula. The seasonal period events are\nalso associated with drying over the south west of the\nPeninsula (Figure 3e, grey dashed contours).\n[14] In summary, Figure 3 indicates that accumulation\nevents at Gomez and JRI occur during different, and to some\nextent opposite, patterns of atmospheric circulation. This\nleads to geographically different d responses to atmospheric\ncirculation changes, even where the mean annual temper-\natures response across the Peninsula may be relatively\nuniform.\n[15] The robust structure of results shown here suggests\nthat the geographical gradients in our predicted annual\nmean d against temperature relationship are regionally\naccurate. However, whilst observations in the north east\nPeninsula indicate that the ERA40 temperature data is\nlocally reliable (Figure 1, green boxes), accumulation in\nERA40 does not reflect the JRI site observations as accu-\nrately as it does in the Dyer and Gomez regions [Miles et\nal., 2008]. The reanalysis JRI elevation is too low [Miles et\nal., 2008]; although specified sub-grid topographic variance\nmodifies the represented ERA40 Peninsula height [Orr et\nal., 2008]. The inaccuracy in elevation is liable to contribute\nto a less realistic ERA40 JRI accumulation regime, although\nFigure 2. Gradients (shaded) and explained variances (R2 - contoured in black) between annual mean T and (a) synoptic\naccumulation biased temperature (T + BPE\nsynop), (b) seasonal accumulation biased temperature (T + BPE\nseas), and (c) total sub-\nannual accumulation biased temperature (T + BPE\nsynop + BPE\nseas). R2 intervals are 0.2, and are shown between 0.3 and 0.9.\nL18801 SIME ET AL.: TEMPERATURE FROM PENINSULA ICE CORES L18801\n3 of 5\nwe also note that the lack of agreement may also relate to\ndifficulties in observing annual accumulation at JRI. Wind\nreworking of snow and summer melt layers make JRI a\ndifficult site [Aristarain et al., 1986]. It is likely that the JRI\nresults we present here could be improved by using higher\nresolution reanalysis, operational forecasts, or regional\nmodel output [van Lipzig et al., 2008; Orr et al., 2008].\nIn the meantime, until higher resolution results are analysed,\nsome caution is required where applying these results to the\nJRI core observations.\n[16] Over longer time periods, other type of change in\nclimate may influence the relationship between annual mean\nd and temperature [e.g., Sime et al., 2008]. Analysis of\nmodel runs over centennial timescales will therefore prove\nnecessary for the interpretation of longer Peninsula ice core\nd records.\n4. Conclusions\n[17] The analysis presented here provides powerful\ninsights into the recovery of annual mean temperature\ninformation from annual mean ice core d records along\nthe Peninsula. We have shown that there are strong geo-\ngraphical gradients in the d recording potential across the\nregion, with a particularly poor relationship between T and d\nin the north (and east); here the JRI d record could explain\nonly 11% to 30% of annual mean temperature variability\n(Figures 1 and 2). This is the result of a very weak\nrelationship between sub-annual accumulation and temper-\nature, and implies that understanding annual mean d varia-\ntions will be difficult in this region. The sites of Dyer and\nGomez represent easier prospects for obtaining proxy tem-\nperature observations. Although we note that the length of\nd record available from these sites is considerably shorter.\nDyer d may explain 75% of the local T variations, and the\namplitude of d variations is approximately 0.9 times the\namplitude of the T variations. For the Gomez region, d may\nexplain 70% of the local T variations. However a strong\npositive PE correlation with T, related to variable autumn\nfluctuations in the SAM [Miles et al., 2008], results in\nlarger amplitude of d variations than the T variations. This\ncauses the Gomez d record to show stronger fluctuations\nthan T, thus d in this region may show 1.3 times the\nexpected fluctuation for a given change in T. This north to\nsouth trend in the T against d relationship is caused by\ndiffering accumulation against temperature responses under\nconditions of intensified westerly flow.\n[18] These findings imply that caution should be attached\nto the interpretation of the magnitude of d fluctuations for\nindividual Peninsula ice cores: a 0.4% JRI; 0.9% Dyer; and\n1.3% Gomez change in d could all indicate an identical\nmagnitude temperature change. Additionally, because the\nnorthern Peninsula exhibits smaller annual mean tempera-\nture fluctuations than the southern Peninsula, annual mean\nFigure 3.

However, the differences we\nhave found here show that by utilising multiple Peninsula\nice cores d records, particularly alongside annual mean\naccumulation values, a detailed reconstruction of the past\nPeninsula climate is possible. This because the core sites\nrespond differently to circulation changes; particularly the\nintensity of westerly flows. Thus multi-core reconstructions\nin this region could provide powerful proxy evidence of\npast Peninsula climate.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
