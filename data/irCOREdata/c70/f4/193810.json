This northeast\u2013southwest trending feature rep-\nresents the boundary between Laurentian crust to the north, and\nAvalonian crust to the south, and was formed during the closure of\nIapetus some 380 Ma. The oblique motion of the closure brought\ntogether a number of terranes on the southern margin of Lauren-\ntia, with which Avalonia subsequently collided (Fig. 1). Since the\nCaledonian Orogeny the British Isles have been characterized by the\nerosion of uplifted blocks and the deposition of the resultant sedi-\nments into basins, with this architecture being controlled by episodes\nof both compression and extension. The most significant of these\nevents was the Variscan Orogeny. This was followed by Jurassic\nseafloor spreading in the central Atlantic, which initiated North Sea\ngraben formation, and Cretaceous rifting in the North Atlantic and\nNorth Sea. The formation of Iceland on the mid-Atlantic ocean\n\u2217Now at: Offshore Hydrocarbon Mapping, Technology Centre, Claymore\nDrive, Aberdeen, UK.\nridge has been associated with Cenozoic uplift and denudation in\nthe British Isles. It has been suggested that permanent uplift (as\nopposed to temporary, dynamic uplift) has been caused by low-\ndensity magma sourced directly from the upwelling Iceland Plume\nunderplating parts of the crust of the British Isles (Jones et al. 2002),\nwith the maximum denudation (and therefore, the maximum amount\nof underplate) occurring in the East Irish Sea, northern England\nregion.\nThe juxtaposed Laurentian and Avalonian structures of the British\nIsles have been the target of a large number of geophysical studies.\nThe British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) car-\nried out surveys along a number of offshore profiles (Klemperer &\nHobbs 1991) typically identifying a two layer crust, with a transpar-\nent upper crust overlying a highly reflective lower crust (McGeary\net al. 1987). The profiles along the east and west coasts of the British\nIsles show a group of north-dipping crustal reflectors which strike\nparallel to the dominant Caledonian trend. These have been iden-\ntified as the subsurface expression of the Iapetus Suture (Freeman\net al. 1988; Brewer et al. 1983). The Lithospheric Seismic Pro-\nfile in Britain (LISPB) (Bamford et al. 1978) and the Caledonian\nSuture Seismic Experiment (CSSP) (Bott et al. 1985; Al-Kindi\net al. 2003) are two deep seismic wide-angle reflection\/refraction\nC\u00a9 2006 NERC 223\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n224 J.

Results from the dense\ncoverage of offshore seismic reflection data and the limited amount\nof deep onshore data have been compiled into a Moho depth map\n(Chadwick & Pharaoh 1998) with values ranging between 25 km\n(northern Scotland) and 36 km (southern England). However the\nonshore crustal thickness is not particularly well constrained. Data\ncollected on the wide distribution of three-component seismic sta-\ntions over the British Isles contains valuable information about all of\nthe inferred geological terranes. The analysis of receiver functions\nfrom these stations can provide estimates of the crustal thickness\nand Vp\/Vs ratio (controlled by the mineral composition and thermal\nstate of the crust). There are notable differences between results\nfrom deep seismic reflection and refraction profiling across the UK;\nfor example, the seismic refraction results do not reveal any signif-\nicant variations in seismic velocity over the Iapetus Suture Zone,\nwhereas the seismic reflection results find strong dipping reflectors\nat the suture. Tomlinson et al. (2003) investigated the receiver func-\ntions in this region, comparing the observed values with the LISPB\nseismic refraction model of Barton (1992), demonstrating azimuthal\nvariations in structure not identified in previous seismic results. In\nthis paper 1-D forward velocity models of the observed receiver\nfunction data are presented and examined to develop understanding\nof the processes resulting in the crustal architecture of the British\nIsles.\n2 D A T A\nThe data used in this study have been recorded on nine broadband\nand 25 short-period three-component seismometers located at 28\nsites throughout the British Isles (Fig. 1). The majority of the sta-\ntions are short-period instruments and are part of the British Geolog-\nical Survey\u2019s seismic monitoring network. Of the nine broad-band\ninstruments, three are permanent stations maintained by the British\nGeological Survey (EDI), IRIS (ESK) and the Atomic Weapons Es-\ntablishment (WOL). The remaining six instruments formed part of\nthe SPICED array that was deployed for approximately 18 months\nbetween 2000 and 2001 (Kendall & Helffrich 2001).\nThe teleseismic records used in this study have been retrieved\nfrom various digital archives, and derived from a list of approxi-\nmately 800 events of Mb > 6.0 occurring between 1990 and 2001,\nlocated at epicentral distances of between 30\u25e6 and 100\u25e6. The ma-\njority of the events originate from around the Pacific rim, with the\nmore proximal events coming from Asia, and along the mid-Atlantic\nocean ridge.\nReceiver functions have been generated from the teleseismic data\nfollowing the methodology of Ammon (1991). Pre-processing of the\nraw data set consisted of re-sampling the data to 0.1 s, applying a\nButterworth bandpass filter between 0.1 and 4 Hz, cutting the data\nto include no more than 30 s before and 90 s after the P-wave\narrival, and finally tapering the ends of the cut seismograms.

The direct P-wave arrivals can be seen at 0 s, the Moho\nP-to-S conversions (occurring at between 3 and 4.5 s) are clearly\nidentifiable on the majority of stations.\n3 H \u2212 \u03ba S T A C K I N G\n3.1 Methodology\nMultiple receiver functions can be stacked in the crustal thickness\n(H)\u2013Vp\/Vs ratio (\u03ba) domain to produce a single robust estimate of\nH and \u03ba (e.g. Zhu & Kanamori 2000; Cheverot & van der Hilst\n2000; Ramesh et al. 2002). The method is applied by calculating\nthe arrival times for the Ps, PpPs and PsPs (and PpSs) phases for a\ngrid of H \u2212 \u03ba values for each receiver function of ray parameter p\nand average crustal P-wave velocity (Vp). The amplitudes of each\nreceiver function at each of these traveltimes are summed to make\nthe stack S(H , \u03ba);\nS(H, \u03ba) =\n\u2211\nj=1 to n\nw1r j (t1) + w2r j (t2) \u2212 w3r j (t3), (1)\nwhere rj is a radial receiver function, t1, t2 and t3 are the predicted Ps,\nPpPs and PsPs times, and w1, w2 and w3 are weighting functions.\nDue to the differing moveout curves of Ps, PpPs and PsPs in the\nH \u2212 \u03ba domain, the point at which the phases intersect gives the\nunique crustal H and \u03ba solution. This intersection point is expressed\nin the stack as the maximum amplitude. The primary advantages\nof H \u2212 \u03ba stacking are that; 1) the stacking is automated, rapidly\nproducing results and negating the need to identify and pick the\ntimes of the Ps, PpPs and PsPs phases, and, 2) the uncertainties of\nthe maximum point of the stack can be estimated. Zhu & Kanamori\n(2000) state that the Taylor expansion of S(H , \u03ba) at the maximum\npoint of the stack, omitting the higher order terms, gives the variance\nof the stack \u03c3 in both H and \u03ba;\n\u03c3 2H = 2\u03c3s\n\/\n\u22022 S\n\u2202 H 2\n, (2)\n\u03c3 2\u03ba = 2\u03c3s\n\/\n\u22022 S\n\u2202\u03ba2\n, (3)\nwhere \u03c3 s is the estimated variance of the maximum value of\nS(H , \u03ba) from the stacks of all the individual receiver functions.\n\u22022S\/\u2202H2 and \u22022S\/\u2202 \u03ba2 are respectively the second derivatives of the\nplanes of constant H and \u03ba that intersect at the maximum point of\nthe stack. \u03c3 2H and \u03c3\n2\n\u03ba are simply a measure of the variance of the\nmaximum point of the stack S(H , \u03ba) and do not include any qual-\nitative information about the input data or any estimate of errors\nintroduced by the choice of input Vp.\nThe H \u2212 \u03ba stacking method uses an a priori average crustal\nVp to calculate H and \u03ba . The primary sensitivity of the receiver\nfunction method is to velocity contrast and relative arrival times of\nthe converted and multiple phases, and not to the absolute velocity\n(Ammon et al. 1990). The Vp\/Vs ratio derived from H \u2212 \u03ba stacking\nis relatively insensitive to change in the input Vp. However, there\nis a considerable velocity-depth trade-off in the measurement. For\nearth models of a similar thickness to the crust of the British Isles\nthere can be an approximately 1 km variation in H for a 0.2 km s\u22121\nchange in Vp.\n3.2 Data analysis\nH \u2212 \u03ba stacking analysis has been applied to all of the 34 broad-band\nand short-period three-component instruments. A total of 1493 re-\nceiver functions have been stacked for the 34 instruments. The ma-\njority of these data have been generated using a water level parameter\nof 0.001 and a Gaussian function G(\u03c9) = e\u2212 \u03c9\n2\n4a2 to limit the band-\nwidth of the resultant receiver function with a = 3 (Ammon 1991).\nIn some cases a has been lowered to 2 to stabilize the maximum\npoint of the stack. The trade-off in using the lower-frequency data\nis that the standard deviation of the maximum point of the H \u2212 \u03ba\nstack is increased. The stacking Ps, PpPs and PpSs times have been\ncalculated for a range of models which increment every 0.1 km in\nthe H domain and every 0.005 in the \u03ba domain.\nTwo separate analyses have been performed on the data from the\nBritish Isles (Table 1). In Analysis 1 a constant Vp of 6.3 km s\u22121\nis used to calculate the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks. This represents the mean\nP-wave velocity of the crust of the British Isles calculated from\nthe principal seismic refraction studies (Barton 1992; Edwards &\nBlundell 1984; Jones et al. 1996; Al-Kindi et al. 2003; Grandjean\net al. 2001). Using the fixed P-wave velocity allows an objective\ninvestigation of the receiver function data.

This\nestimate does not include any qualitative information about the in-\nput receiver functions, for example as to whether the phases that\nproduce the maximum stacking point are in fact the Moho Ps, PpPs\nand PpSs\/PsPs phases.\n3.3.1 Stack quality\nIn order to provide a qualitative description of the results, each H \u2212\n\u03ba stack has been categorized as either high (1) intermediate (2) or\nlow quality (3). Identification of the maxima of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks is\nparticularly dependent upon how well resolved is the PpPs phase.\nApplying a lower pass Gaussian filter when calculating the receiver\nfunctions has helped to stabilize those H \u2212 \u03ba stacks where the PpPs\nphase is poorly resolved. The H \u2212 \u03ba stack from BTA (Fig. 3b)\nhas been classified as high quality (1); the Ps and PpPs phases\nthat form the maximum point of the stack can be clearly identified\nin the raw receiver function data. The H \u2212 \u03ba stack from CWF\n(Fig. 3c) has been classified as an intermediate quality (2) stack.\nThe Ps phase in the raw receiver functions is clearly identifiable but\nany PpPs phases are of much lower amplitude, bringing ambiguity\nto location of the maximum point of the H \u2212 \u03ba stack.

This classification scheme is similar to that\nused by Cheverot & van der Hilst (2000) from which they provide\nan estimate of the quality of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks from their study.\n3.3.2 Velocity-depth trade-off\nConstraint on the velocity-depth trade-off is provided by the LISPB\nonshore deep seismic refraction profile (Barton 1992; Bamford et al.\n1978). Along the profile the average seismic velocity remains close\nto 6.3 \u00b1 0.1 km s\u22121, with the exception of the Midland Valley where\nit increases to >6.5 km s\u22121. The maximum observed variation in\naverage crustal P-wave velocity translates to a difference in crustal\nthickness estimate of between 2 to 3 km for a crust of 30 km. This is\nsignificantly smaller than the range of observed crustal thicknesses\n(25\u201335 km).\n3.3.3 3-D structure\nMany H \u2212 \u03ba stacking study authors follow Zhu & Kanamori (2000),\nwho by stacking receiver functions from a range of different dis-\ntances and directions, suppress effects of radial structure and so\nobtain an average 1-D crustal model beneath the recording station.\nTo examine whether the resulting crustal thickness and Vp\/Vs ra-\ntio represent the true structure beneath the station in a simple 3-D\nenvironment, a series of H \u2212 \u03ba stacks have been performed on\nsynthetic receiver functions from different backazimuths using a\n3-D ray-tracing program (Cassidy 1992) (Fig. 4). The results show\nthat the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks of the individual 3-D receiver functions from\ndifferent back-azimuths do not oscillate about the 1-D solution as\nmight be expected (Fig. 4a). The maximum up-dip receiver func-\ntions (backazimuth = 270\u25e6) produce a lower H and higher \u03ba than\nthe reference 1-D stack. The down dip receiver functions produce\na slightly greater H than the reference model, while \u03ba still remains\nslightly higher than the true 1-D solution. It is clear that if receiver\nfunctions from an even distribution of backazimuths were stacked,\nthe expected 1-D solution would not be obtained through the aver-\naging process suggested by Zhu & Kanamori (2000).\nThe crustal thickness within the British Isles varies between 25\nand 35 km, but these changes occur over large distances (Chadwick\n& Pharaoh 1998). It is unlikely that Moho dips are greater than 5\u25e6\nbeneath any of the stations from which data are analysed in this study.\nBelow this threshold the perturbation in the H \u2212 \u03ba stack results is\n<1 km for crust with a similar velocity structure to the British\nIsles. This difference is of a similar magnitude to the measured\nstandard deviations of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks. The dipping structures\nimaged within the crust and upper mantle of the British Isles by the\nBIRPS profiles are not associated with large velocity discontinuities\n(e.g. Jones et al. 1996), and only result in small variation in crustal\nthickness by applying the 1-D approximation to the H \u2212 \u03ba stack\ncalculations.\n4 1 - D M O D E L L I N G\nThe crustal velocity structure beneath the stations in this study has\nbeen investigated using detailed 1-D forward modelling of the ob-\nserved radial receiver function data.

(a) The maximum points of H \u2212 \u03ba stacks for the synthetic receiver functions from a dipping Moho model. The stacks use data from variable\nbackazimuths (labelled next to the maximum point). The 3-D model consists of a single layer crust of H = 30 km, \u03ba = 1.73, Vp = 6.3 km s\u22121 and a Moho\ndipping 10\u25e6 to the east. The dots are 5\u25e6 increment models in between the labelled results. The inverted triangle is the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking result from a 1-D synthetic\nreceiver function using identical parameters.

(c) A sketch of the cross-sectional view of the lateral extent at the Moho of the Ps and PpPs phases through the dipping layer model.\nforward results from the Iapetus Suture Zone (Tomlinson et al.\n2003), in this study we have (1) identified the Moho Ps and PpPs\nphases using the results of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking, and (2) fitted the\nremaining phases in the observed receiver functions as conver-\nsions and multiples from specific velocity discontinuities by iter-\native modification of simple velocity models. Receiver functions\nare primarily sensitive to velocity contrast and relative arrival times\nof phases (Ammon et al. 1990). To limit uncertainty introduced by\nthe velocity-depth offset of the model it is necessary to constrain the\noutput models with a priori velocity data. This modelling approach\nallows a good estimate of the receiver function velocity discontinuity\nstructure to be developed, while honouring the velocity information\nof previous seismic studies.\nThe synthetic seismograms have been calculated using the\nmethod of Ammon (1991); this code is based upon the reflection\nmatrix synthetic seismogram code of Kennett (1983). The modelling\nstudy has been carried out on stacks of the observed receiver func-\ntions. The variability of these stacked receiver functions has been\nestimated by calculating the standard deviation of each point in the\nreceiver function stack. The short-period data have been modelled by\nlimiting the bandwidth of the synthetic seismograms, reproducing\nthe negative lobes that ring the receiver function phases, which are\ncaused by performing the deconvolution with the limited bandwidth\ndata. Where broad-band and short-period receivers were co-located,\nexamination of the two data sets has shown that the resultant velocity\nmodels are comparable.\nThe results of receiver function modelling are non-unique. There\nare three crustal model parameters which control the observed and\nsynthetic receiver functions: (1) the depth to seismic velocity inter-\nfaces, (2) the P-wave velocity, and (3) the S-wave velocity (or Vp\/Vs\nratio). As already noted with the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking analysis, there is a\nvelocity-depth trade-off when fitting the phases of the observed re-\nceiver functions. The steps used in the 1-D forward modelling proce-\ndure, to maximize model constraint and minimize non-uniqueness,\nare subjective and may result in models that contain structures which\nare not specifically required to fit the observed data. Unconstrained\nlinear inversions of the broad-band receiver function data have been\nperformed to provide an estimate of the significance of the a priori\nstructures which have been incorporated into the 1-D forward mod-\nels. Inversions of the data from the short-period stations have not\nbeen performed to avoid mis-interpretation of the negative decon-\nvolution ringing lobes as significant crustal velocity structures.\n5 R E S U LT S\nA summary of all of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking and 1-D forward models that\nfit the observed receiver functions from the stations in the British\nIsles is presented in Figs 5(a) and (b). Only models for stations\nwhere high-quality data have been recorded are presented. Where\ntwo instruments are co-located, a representative model is presented.\nThe results from H \u2212 \u03ba stacking Analysis 1 are presented as\nmaps of crustal thickness and Vp\/Vs ratio across the British Isles\n(Figs 6a and b). There is considerable variation in crustal thickness\nover the British Isles, consistent with the seismic reflection crustal\nthickness variations presented by Chadwick & Pharaoh (1998), and\nto some extent correlating with the underlying terrane geology. The\nvariation in Vp\/Vs ratio follows a less consistent pattern than crustal\nthickness.\n5.1 Near surface structure\nMany of the 1-D models from the stations in the British Isles include\nsignificant velocity contrasts at less than 5 km depth (e.g. Figs 5 and\n7d\u2013f). Their effects on the observed receiver functions are variable.\nIn the data from the southeast of England (SWN, WOL & TFO)\nwhere the stations are located on Mesozoic sedimentary sequences,\nthere are many high-amplitude phases that make interpretation of\nthe deep crustal structure difficult (Fig. 2). Where the stations are lo-\ncated on Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian sequences (e.g. EDI,\nBTA) (Fig. 7) there are strong phases in the observed receiver func-\ntions but a model for the crustal structure can still be obtained. At\nsome stations there are strong phases between the direct P-wave\narrival and the Moho Ps phase. These phases can be attributed to\neither (1) multiple energy from near surface structures or (2) Ps\nconversions from deeper intracrustal structures.

The black dots show the\nresults of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking for each station with associated \u00b11\u03c3 error bars.\nthe latter requires forward models with significant velocity discon-\ntinuities in the crust. The deep seismic refraction profiles from the\nBritish Isles in general do not contain the large intracrustal velocity\ndiscontinuities required (Barton 1992; Al-Kindi et al. 2003), and\ntherefore these phases have been modelled as multiples from near\nsurface structures. The presence of near surface structure is not lim-\nited to stations that are situated on Upper Palaeozoic and Mesozoic\nsedimentary basins. Stations that are located on Silurian, Ordovi-\ncian, Cambrian and Precambrian rocks have much lower amplitude\nphases from near surface structures. However, the 1-D forward mod-\nels still require a velocity discontinuity in the near surface to fit the\nobserved receiver functions. In these cases the discontinuity (gen-\nerally being from \u223c5.5 to \u223c6.0 km s\u22121) has been interpreted, in line\nwith the results of seismic refraction surveys, as the contrast be-\ntween Lower Palaeozoic sequences and crystalline basement rocks\n(e.g. Bott et al. 1985; Bamford et al. 1978; Grandjean et al. 2001).\n5.2 Northern Scotland\nThe stations from Northern Scotland (LRW, ORE, MCD, RRR, KPL\nand KARB) sample Laurentian crust from the Hebridean, Northern\nHighland and Grampian Highland terranes (Fig. 1). The H \u2212 \u03ba\nstacking and 1-D forward models reveal crustal thicknesses that\nrange between 24 and 31 km and Vp\/Vs ratios that range between\n1.74 and 1.76. The majority of the stations in Northern Scotland\nare located on Caledonian basement rocks. This is reflected in the\nreceiver functions that are not affected by high-amplitude phases\nfrom near surface velocity discontinuities. The resultant H \u2212 \u03ba\nstacks were of high quality with the exception of those from two\nstations (LRW & KARB).\nThe stations ORE, RRR and KPL to the north and west of the re-\ngion show thinner crust (24\u201328 km) than MCD (31 km) to the south\nof the Great Glen fault. The values at ORE and RRR are consistent\nwith modelling by Asencio et al. (2003). The Vp\/Vs ratios at these\nstations are similar, within the tight 1.74 to 1.76 bound. Despite\nthe abundance of data from LRW (n = 52), the receiver functions\nshow very low-amplitude Ps and PpPs conversions and this is re-\nflected in the poorly constrained nature of the maximum point of the\nH \u2212 \u03ba stack. At KARB there are few high-quality receiver functions\nwhich may be limiting the quality of the stack. The 1-D modelling\nresults from the stations in the northwest of Scotland show crustal\nthicknesses up to 3 km thinner than those beneath the LISPB profile,\nwith MCD in the east showing slightly thicker crust. The westerly\nthinning of the crust is consistent with the projected crustal thinning\nbased on the seismic reflection profiles recorded offshore west of\nScotland (Chadwick & Pharaoh 1998). The receiver function data\nfrom RRR, KARB and KPL have low-amplitude Ps conversions\nfrom the Moho. To fit these phases a 3 to 4 km thick velocity gradi-\nent is required at the base of the crust.\n5.3 Midland Valley of Scotland\nThe H \u2212 \u03ba stacks from the stations that sample the Laurentian\nMidland Valley of Scotland (EDI & PGB) find differing crustal\nC\u00a9 2006 NERC, GJI, 167, 223\u2013237\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n230 J.

The black lines represent the terrane boundaries presented in\nFig. 1.\nthicknesses of 30 km in the west and 34 km in the east. The Midland\nValley contains up to 5 km of Palaeozoic sediments above the Cale-\ndonian basement rocks. The velocity contrast between the sediments\nand the basement is seen in the 1-D forward models of the observed\nreceiver functions (e.g. for example see Fig. 5a). 1-D forward mod-\nels from both EDI and PGB show a high-velocity layer at the base\nof the crust, which concurs with the Barton (1992) model for the\nMidland Valley. The inclusion of the high-velocity layer at the base\nof the crust at PGB gives a crustal thickness from 1-D modelling\nthat is 6 km thicker than the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking solution. The observed\nreceiver functions for both stations have clear Ps phases but at PGB\nthe PpPs phase is less well defined, and this may have introduced\nambiguity into the H \u2212 \u03ba stack solution.\n5.4 Iapetus Suture\nThe stations from the Iapetus Suture region sample the Laurentian\nSouthern Uplands terrane to the north of the Iapetus Suture, and\nGondwanan terranes to the south (ESK, GAL, BHH, BBO, BTA,\nGIM, LMI and HPK). The crustal thicknesses range between 27\nand 31 km and the Vp\/Vs ratios between 1.65 and 1.79. The near\nsurface geology beneath the stations is variable ranging from the\nOrdovician\u2013Silurian sequences of the Southern Uplands to the Car-\nboniferous sediments of the Solway Basin. Although these near sur-\nface structures have affected the observed receiver functions and\ntherefore the resultant 1-D models, the majority of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks\nare of high quality (Table 1). In particular the data from ESK and\nBBO show very clear Ps and PpPs phases. The stack from BHH\nwas produced using receiver function data that was calculated using\nthe lower-frequency Gaussian filter (a = 2) to stabilize the initial\nH \u2212 \u03ba stack. GAL has a clear Ps phase but again suffers from\na poorly resolved PpPs phase that results in a smeared maximum\npoint of the stack.\nAs we have previously noted (Tomlinson et al. 2003), compar-\nison between the observed receiver functions and those produced\nby calculating synthetic seismograms based on the LISPB model,\nshows that the observed Ps and PpPs phases arrive at somewhat\nearlier times than those predicted by the LISPB model. This time\ndifference translates into a crustal thickness anomaly of up to 5 km\nbetween the LISPB and both the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking and 1-D forward\nreceiver function models.\n5.5 Central England & Wales\nThe stations from central England and Wales (WCB, CWF, MCH,\nSSP, SWN, WOL and TFO) sample the crust of the Midland Plat-\nform and Welsh basin, part of the Avalonian terrane.

At ESKB the linear inversion\nmodels are shown (grey).\nH \u2212 \u03ba stacks from the stations are of high quality (Table 1).\nOf the intermediate quality results, the crustal thicknesses are the\ngreatest measured within the British Isles, ranging between 35\nand 39 km, with the Vp\/Vs ratio ranging between 1.71 and 1.79.\nThe one exception to this is WCB which shows a much thinner\n27 km thick crust and a high Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.85. For the inter-\nmediate quality data the Ps phase is generally well defined; but\nthe PpPs phases are unclear. In the case of CWF there is a high-\namplitude, well-defined Ps phase, and a very low-amplitude PpPs\nphase.\nAlthough there are differences in the near surface structure with\nstations WCB, CWF, SSP and MCH being located on Precambrian,\nCambrian, Silurian and Devonian rocks, their crustal structure re-\nmains similar. Receiver function models have been derived based on\nC\u00a9 2006 NERC, GJI, 167, 223\u2013237\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n232 J. P. Tomlinson et al.\nthe LISPB Delta velocity model (Edwards & Blundell 1984) which\nincorporates two crustal layers (Fig. 5b). The boundary between the\nupper and lower crust has been constrained by the intracrustal PpPs\nphases at between 7 and 8s. A characteristic of the data from these\nstations is that the Moho PpPs phase is low amplitude and difficult\nto identify in the observed receiver functions. In some cases this\nhas resulted in unstable H \u2212 \u03ba stacking. In particular it was noted\nthat the H \u2212 \u03ba stacking of the data from WCB produces an un-\nusually thin, high Vp\/Vs ratio crustal model. The 1-D modelling of\nthe data from WCB using the default Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.73 reveals a\ncrustal thickness of \u223c32 km, which is much closer to the observed\nvalues at the northern end of the LISPB Delta profile (34 km) and\nseismic reflection data (32 km) reported by Chadwick & Pharaoh\n(1998).\nThe southern stations of SWN, TFO and WOL are located on\nCretaceous sediments. The receiver functions from these stations\ncontain many high-amplitude phases and the resultant H \u2212 \u03ba stacks\nfrom SWN and TFO are classified as poor quality (eq. 3). For these\ntwo stations it is possible to identify consistent phases at arrival\ntimes that correlate with Moho Ps phases, but there are too many\nhigh-amplitude reverberations to identify which, if any, is the Moho\nPpPs phase required to constrain the stack.\n5.6 Southwest England\nThe few stations from the southwest of England (HTL, CR2, DYA,\nJRS and JSAB) are located on Avalonian crust that has been de-\nformed by the Variscan Orogeny. For the Channel Islands stations\n(JRS and JSAB) the underlying crustal geology is from the Armor-\nican terrane. The crustal thicknesses measured by those stations\nlocated on the mainland range between 28 and 31 km, and the Vp\/Vs\nratios between 1.66 and 1.80. The H \u2212 \u03ba stacks for the two stations\non the Channel Islands return similar H \u2212 \u03ba values of \u223c32 km and\n\u223c1.75 respectively. The data from the stations in this area return\nhigh-quality H \u2212 \u03ba stacks with the exception of those from HTL\nand JRS.\nThe stations to the south of the Variscan front (HTL, CR2 and\nDYA) show a crust that at between 28 and 31 km, is 5 to 8 km\nthinner than the 36 km reached in central England and Wales. This\nthinner crust is consistent with the observations along the LISPB\nDelta profile (Edwards & Blundell 1984) and the seismic reflection\nMoho map (Chadwick & Pharaoh 1998). The Vp\/Vs ratios for the\nstations range between 1.66 and 1.80. At HTL the near surface Car-\nboniferous sedimentary sequences complicate the observed receiver\nfunctions, and at DYA and CR2 where the instruments are located\non the Cornubian granite batholith, near surface structure is still\npresent. Holder & Bott (1971) find that the granite extends to 10\u201312\nkm depth, so these structures must occur within the granite. In the\nmodels for HTL, DYA and CR2 there is an intracrustal structure\nbetween 14 and 17 km depth. This range is somewhat deeper than\nthe base of the granite observed by Holder & Bott (1971), and may\ncorrelate with the R2 reflector of Brooks et al. (1984), which was\nsuggested to represent a major Variscan thrust.\nThe stations located on the Channel Island of Jersey are the only\nones from which the data sample the crust of the Armorican micro-\ncontinent. These stations show a crust that is thicker than the stations\nin southwest England. The two layer crust is similar to that observed\nat CWF, SSP and MCH located on the thick Avalonian crust. The\nArmorican crust, like the Avalonian crust of central England and\nWales is relatively undeformed and may represent a relict fragment\nof a Gondwanan craton.\n6 U P P E R M A N T L E S T R U C T U R E\nStructures have been modelled in the uppermost mantle (<100 km\ndepth) from the data recorded at four stations (Fig. 8).\nAt ORE on the northern coast of Scotland, the \u2018Flannan\u2019 and\n\u2018W-reflectors\u2019 (e.g. Klemperer & Hobbs 1991) have been identified\nin the observed receiver functions (Tomlinson et al. 2003; Asencio\net al. 2003). Asencio et al. (2003) also identify the \u2018A-reflector\u2019, and\nsuggest that their findings of multiple reflectors in the upper mantle\nin this region are evidence of pervasive and laterally heterogeneous\nvelocity discontinuities related to the localized tectonic and thermal\nhistory of northwest Scotland. These results increase the plausibility\nof similar structures modelled within the upper mantle in this study.\nOur model for the W-reflector at ORE supports the seismic re-\nfraction models of Price & Morgan (2000), showing a gradational\nlow-velocity zone above an 8.5 km s\u22121 layer at a depth of 46 km.\nThis, correlating with the W-reflector beneath the DRUM and GRID\ndeep seismic refraction profiles (Klemperer & Hobbs 1991) is con-\nsistent with the reflector modelled by Asencio et al. (2003) at a depth\nof 48 km.\nThe data from the stations RRR, KARB (NW Scotland) and GIM\n(Isle of Man) have been fitted with similar models to that for ORE,\nindicating the presence of further subcrustal layered zones. The\nmantle discontinuity beneath RRR appears at 38 km, again consis-\ntent with the 39 km modelled by Asencio et al. (2003). At KARB,\n\u223c100 km to the south of RRR, a similar boundary is observed at a\ndepth of 33 km which we also suggest represents the A-reflector.\nAsencio et al. (2003) attribute the submantle phases they have\nidentified to thin anisotropic layers beneath these stations (\u223c5 km\nbeneath RRR and \u223c10 km beneath ORE) suggesting preferred ori-\nentation of olivine and orthopyroxene crystals either frozen or re-\noriented within a tectonic strain fabric. While these inferences are\nnot available from our data, the indication of a deeper discontinuity\nbeneath ORE would support the presence of there being multiple-\nlayered reflectors in the upper mantle beneath northern Scotland.\nThe southward continuity of these multiple layered velocity dis-\ncontinuities is unknown. However, the data from the stations in\nthe Midland Valley contain no subcrustal structures suggesting that\nthose in northwest Scotland must terminate or pinch out toward the\nsouth. However an equivalent structure is seen beneath GIM on the\nIsle of Man. Models from the other stations in the Iapetus Suture\nZone, as well as the WINCH seismic reflection profile (Hall et al.\n1984) do not show structures similar to that found beneath GIM, sug-\ngesting they are a local feature. If the subcrustal low-velocity zone\nat GIM is linked to subduction related metasomatism (as has been\nsuggested for the low-velocity zone above the W-reflector (Price\n& Morgan 2000)), then it may represent a relic subduction zone\nformed during the closure of the Iapetus Ocean. While speculative,\nthis is in accord with the suggestion of Asencio et al. (2003) that\n\u2018. . . a complex history at the local and regional scale may play a\nvery important role in the observed characteristics of these velocity\ndiscontinuities in the mantle lithosphere\u2019.\n7 D E P T H D E P E N D E N C E O F Vp\/ Vs\nTo examine the relationship between the observed crustal thick-\nnesses and Vp\/Vs ratios, the results of all of the H \u2212 \u03ba stacks have\nbeen plotted (Fig. 9).

The stations from the north of Scotland produce the highest\nquality H \u2212 \u03ba stacks. The range of observed Vp\/Vs ratios (1.74\u20131.76)\nis close to the average for extended continental crust (Christensen\n& Mooney 1995). This small variation in \u03ba over crustal thicknesses\nbetween 24 and 31 km would suggest that although the thickness\nof the crust may be varying, the bulk crustal composition remains\nstable.\nResults from many geophysical studies of the structure of the\nBritish Isles, including this one, suggest that there is a high-velocity\nlayer at the base of the crust (e.g. Al-Kindi et al. 2003; Barton 1992).\nClift & Turner (1998) studied crustal uplift across the British Isles\nand showed that their observations could be caused by up to 4 km of\nmagmatic underplating at the base of the crust. If the high-velocity\nlayer at the base of the crust does result from basic magmatic under-\nplating, it would be reasonable to expect that the bulk crustal Vp\/Vs\nratio would increase (Cheverot & van der Hilst 2000). The change\nin bulk Vp\/Vs ratio has been calculated for varying thicknesses of\nunderplated material (Fig. 9). The example uses a continental crust\nof thickness = 25 km, Vp = 6.3 km s\u22121 and \u03ba = 1.73 (\u03c3 = 0.25)\nand underplated gabbroic material of Vp = 7.3 km s\u22121 and \u03ba = 1.84\n(\u03c3 = 0.30).

Varia-\ntions of such small magnitude are below the resolution of the Vp\/Vs\nvalues obtained here.\n8 C R U S T A L T H I C K N E S S A N O M A L Y\nThe results from receiver function analysis of the data from the\nstations in the Iapetus Suture region do not agree with the crustal\nthicknesses from the previous seismic refraction studies (e.g. Barton\n1992; Al-Kindi et al. 2003). The stations to the south of the Midland\nValley (ESK, BHH, BTA, BBO, GIM, LMI & WCB) which span\nthe region directly above the Iapetus Suture Zone have crustal thick-\nnesses (27\u201330 km) that are up to 7 km less than the LISPB model\n(34 km) (Barton 1992). Although these stations are not located\ndirectly on the LISPB profile, the near perpendicular CSSP deep\nseismic refraction profile shows that the crustal thickness remains\nbetween 32 and 34 km along strike of the structures investigated by\nthe LISPB profile (Al-Kindi et al. 2003). There are several possible\nexplanations for this mismatch:\n(1) the average crustal velocity used in the receiver function mod-\nelling is too low, reducing the measured crustal thickness;\n(2) the bulk crustal Vp\/Vs ratio used in the receiver function mod-\nelling is too low;\n(3) the seismic velocity of the crust is anisotropic, generating an\nunderestimate in crustal thickness and\n(4) the receiver function Ps phases are from a different interface\nto the Moho defined by seismic refraction.\nConsidering these points in turn:\n(1, 2) Incorrect average Vp and or bulk crustal Vp\/Vs.\nIt is possible to define the average crustal Vp with respect to the\narrival time of the Moho Ps (TPs) and PpPs (TPpPs) phases, the\ncrustal thickness (H) and the ray parameter of the teleseismic\nevent (p):\nVp =\n\u221a\n1\n(TPpPs\u2212TPs )2\n4H2\n+ p2\n. (4)\nBy fixing the value of H and using the times of the Moho Ps and\nPpPs phase from the results of H \u2212 \u03ba stacking it is possible to test the\nP-wave velocity that is required to make the receiver function data\nfrom the Iapetus Suture area fit the crustal thickness data from the\nLISPB and CSSP seismic refraction experiments. To fit a crustal\nthickness of 33 km with the data from BTA, the average crustal\nP-wave velocity must be \u223c7.1 km s\u22121, with a Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.74.\nTo fit the same crustal thickness model with the data from BHH, Vp\nmust increase to \u223c7.5 km s\u22121, with a Vp\/Vs ratio of 1.79. These\nvalues for Vp represent a significant increase in average crustal\nP-wave velocity. Deep seismic refraction studies of the British Isles\nreveal the average crustal P-wave velocity varies between 6.2 and\n6.6 km s\u22121, and it is unlikely that an average velocity of between 7\nand 7.5 km s\u22121 is reached beneath the Iapetus Suture region. Fix-\ning the crustal thickness, H , allows a unique solution for both Vp\nand Vp\/Vs to be calculated. These calculations show that the Vp\/Vs\nratios for BTA (H \u2212 \u03ba stacking Vp\/Vs = 1.75) and BHH (H \u2212 \u03ba\nstacking Vp\/Vs = 1.81) are only altered slightly relative to the H \u2212\n\u03ba stacking results when H is fixed. This again highlights the fact\nthat although there is a velocity-depth trade-off in the modelling of\nreceiver function data, the calculated Vp\/Vs ratio is relatively insen-\nsitive to changes in H and Vp.\n(3) Anisotropic crustal velocity.\nThe ray paths of the phases used in receiver function studies are\nclose to vertical, whereas the ray paths of phases constraining the\nvelocities in seismic refraction studies are predominantly horizon-\ntal. If the seismic velocity of the rocks beneath the British Isles\nis anisotropic, then it is likely a mismatch between the receiver\nfunction and seismic refraction results may occur if the data are\ninterpreted without considering this anisotropy.

The results of the modelling of receiver function data from the Iapetus Suture Zone using the seismic velocity anisotropy code of Levin & Park\n(1998): (a) a model with the anisotropy ellipse with a vertical axis of symmetry and 20 per cent anisotropy is required to fit the timing of the phases in the\nobserved receiver functions at BTA if the crustal thickness = 33 km and Vp = 6.4 km s\u22121; (b) the data from BHH require an anisotropy model with 25 per cent\nanisotropy and (c) the data from BBO require an anisotropy of 25 per cent.\nseismic velocity anisotropy causing the observed mismatch be-\ntween the seismic refraction and receiver function models has\nbeen tested using code which incorporates anisotropy into the\nforward model (Levin & Park 1997, 1998). Figs 10(a)\u2013(c) show\nthat, if the crust close to the Iapetus Suture has a thickness of\n33 km and a horizontal P-wave velocity of 6.4 km s\u22121 (as indi-\ncated by seismic refraction (Barton 1992; Al-Kindi et al. 2003)), to\nthen fit the observed receiver functions there must be a bulk crustal\nP- and S-wave anisotropy of 20\u201325 per cent, with the fast axis of\nthe anisotropy ellipsoid being vertical.\nSeismic velocity anisotropy can be caused by several mecha-\nnisms. In the upper crust the main cause of anisotropy is thought to\nbe the presence of aligned cracks and pore space. In the lower crust\nit is assumed that the cracks are closed and lattice preferred orien-\ntation of mineral crystals is the main cause of anisotropy (Levin &\nPark 1998). Jones et al. (1996) studied the mismatch between seis-\nmic reflection and seismic refraction results offshore the north of\nScotland. They found that the seismic reflection Moho is deeper\nthan the seismic refraction Moho. A bulk crustal seismic velocity\nanisotropy of \u223c7 per cent was required to eliminate the mismatch be-\ntween the two data sets, with the fast axis of the anisotropy ellipsoid\nbeing horizontal. If anisotropy is the cause of the different receiver\nfunction and seismic refraction estimates of crustal thickness then it\nhas to be caused by a different mechanism to the anisotropy observed\nbeneath the North of Scotland.\n(4) Conversions from an interface above the Moho.\nIt seems unlikely, given the changes in bulk crustal Vp and the mag-\nnitude of the seismic velocity anisotropy required to fit the observed\ndata for a reasonable crustal thickness of 33 km, that the observed\nreceiver function phases are caused by the seismic refraction Moho\ndefined by Barton (1992) and Al-Kindi et al. (2003). Recent re-\nsults from studies of crust\/upper mantle structure of the Ethiopian\nC\u00a9 2006 NERC, GJI, 167, 223\u2013237\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\n236 J. P. Tomlinson et al.\nrift (Mackenzie et al. 2005; Maguire et al. 2006; Stuart et al. 2006)\nshow a similar mismatch in crustal thickness estimates from seismic\nwide-angle reflection\/refraction and receiver function modelling.\nThe latter identifies the principle base crustal receiver function Ps\nconversions near the top of a high-velocity (Vp \u223c 7.4 km s\u22121) under-\nplate layer identified from the controlled source survey (Mackenzie\net al. 2005). It is possible that the base of the underplate layer is gra-\ndational owing to the method of emplacement and, therefore, does\nnot provide a significant receiver function conversion (Stuart et al.\n2006).\nJones et al. (2002) suggest the locus of maximum Cenozoic de-\nnudation in the British Isles is centred on north England and the\nIrish Sea, and that the denudation is driven mainly by permanent\nuplift resulting from magmatic underplating, the greatest amount of\nmelt being added to the crust beneath this region. Al-Kindi et al.\n(2003) model a welt shaped high-velocity layer in the CSSP\/ICCSP\ndata which is centred upon the uplift maximum in the middle of the\nIrish Sea. They conclude that this high-velocity body is underplated\nmagmatic material, and it is this which has caused the regional up-\nlift. The maximum thickness of this layer is \u223c8 km; centred beneath\nthe Isle of Man. The velocities within the centre of this layer are\n7.2 to 7.8 km s\u22121. The velocity of the lower crust above this layer\nreaches 6.6 km s\u22121. It is likely that the phases originally considered\nto result from Moho conversion do in fact correspond to conversions\nfrom the top of the high-velocity layer at the base of the crust. The\ncrustal thicknesses measured by the receiver functions correspond\nwith the depth to the top of the high-velocity layer between \u223c25\nand 30 km rather than with the depth to the seismic refraction Moho\nat \u223c33 km. The velocity model for the southern end of the LISPB\nprofile does not include a specific layer of high-velocity underplate\n(Barton 1992) but does include a high-velocity layer at the base of\nthe crust. The intersection point of LISPB and CSSP is off-centre of\nthe maximum thickness of the underplate layer and, therefore, the\npresence of the underplated layer may be less obvious in the LISPB\ndata.\nThe top surface of the proposed underplate defined by the receiver\nfunction models, together with the layer beneath the CSSP profile\nprovide constraint on the minimum extent of the underplate material\nbeneath central Britain. Fig. 11 shows that these data correspond\nwith the area of maximum Cenozoic denudation through the East\nIrish Sea and northern England, as described by Jones et al. (2002).\nThe correlation of the anomalous seismic models to the denuda-\ntion data support the Jones et al. (2002) contention that the observed\nuplift is caused by material from the Iceland plume, transported\nin a subvertical asthenospheric sheet beneath the present Faroes\u2013\nIrish Sea\u2013Lundy axis, underplating the crust. Clift & Turner (1998)\nsuggest that the maximum thickness of underplate (>5 km) in the\nBritish Isles is beneath northwestern Scotland, corresponding with\nthe Tertiary igneous centres of the Inner Isles. The receiver function\nmodels from this region (RRR, KPL & KARB) include a velocity\ngradient at the base of the crust. It may be the case that these velocity\ngradients represent a layer of underplate that contrasts less strongly\nwith the overlying crustal material than that in Central Britain. The\ntop of the gradational layers are some 3\u20134 km shallower than the\nseismic reflection Moho defined by Chadwick & Pharaoh (1998).\nThe thickness of these gradational layers have been used to con-\nstrain the contours in Fig. 11. The receiver function models from\nnortheastern Scotland (ORE & MCD) do not show any signs of un-\nderplated material and are consistent with the denudation observed\nby Jones et al. (2002). The receiver function results from South-\nern England and Wales do not indicate the presence of significant\nunderplated material.\n348\u00b0\n348\u00b0\n352\u00b0\n352\u00b0\n356\u00b0\n356\u00b0\n0\u00b0\n0\u00b0\n50\u00b0 50\u00b0\n52\u00b0 52\u00b0\n54\u00b0 54\u00b0\n56\u00b0 56\u00b0\n58\u00b0 58\u00b0\n60\u00b0 60\u00b0\n62\u00b0 62\u00b0\n2 2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n4\nLISPB\nCSSP\nLISPB\nDelta\n3\n5\nFigure 11.

H \u2212 \u03ba stacking has been used to produce\na series of point values for crustal thickness and average crustal\nVp\/Vs ratio. The 1-D forward modelling of the receiver function\nphases has provided detailed information about the velocity-depth\nstructure beneath each of the seismic monitoring stations.\nCrustal thicknesses beneath the British Isles vary between 24 and\n36 km, and Vp\/Vs ratios vary between 1.60 and 1.85. In general, the\nmodels from H \u2212 \u03ba stacking and 1-D forward modelling correlate\nwith the observations from previous deep seismic reflection and\nrefraction profiles. The common features of crustal morphology\nthat have been seen are\n(1) thinning of the crust to \u223c25 km in northwest Scotland,\n(2) a 36 km thick crust in the Midland Valley of Scotland,\n(3) a \u223c36 km thick crust through central England and Wales and\n(4) thinner crust (\u223c28 km) in the southwest of England.\nThe main exception to the correlation in crustal thickness iden-\ntified between the receiver function models and those from previ-\nous seismic refraction studies occurs in the region surrounding the\nIrish Sea, where the base of the crust derived from receiver function\nmodelling is up to 7 km shallower than the seismic refraction Moho.\nThe source of these discrepancies was investigated, with the most\nlikely cause being that the modelled receiver function Moho and\nC\u00a9 2006 NERC, GJI, 167, 223\u2013237\nJournal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nUK crustal velocity structure 237\nthe seismic refraction Moho close to the Iapetus Suture are in fact\ndifferent boundaries. Correlating this observation with the results of\nAl-Kindi et al. (2003) suggests that the strongest receiver function\nPs phases from this area have originated from the top of a layer\nof high-velocity underplated material which is up to 7 km thick at\nthe base of the crust. The correlation between the top of this under-\nplate layer and the observed pattern of Cenozoic denudation over the\nBritish Isles is good, supporting the hypothesis that the underplate\nmaterial was sourced from the Iceland plume.\nThe models from the lithospheric mantle have been compared\nwith previous results from Asencio et al. (2003). We have modelled\nequivalent discontinuities within the lithospheric mantle beneath\nnorthern Scotland, which have been correlated with the Flannan, W-\nand A-reflectors identified by the BIRPS offshore reflection profiles\n(e.g. Klemperer & Hobbs 1991). The data from this study show that\nthese structures must be truncated or pinch out southwards as they\nare not present in the receiver function data from stations in the Mid-\nland Valley of Scotland and further south. The isolated subcrustal\nvelocity structure at GIM is similar to that found at ORE which\ncorrelates with the W-reflector. The W-reflector has been proposed\nas subducted oceanic crust (Price & Morgan 2000), and as such,\nthe discontinuity found at GIM may represent a relict subduction\nstructure resulting from the closure of the Iapetus Ocean.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThe work of JPT was supported by a CASE studentship at the British\nGeological Survey and AWE Contract OCG0385, and it is published\nwith the permission of the Executive Director, BGS (NERC).\nR E F E R E N C E S\nAl-Kindi, S., White, N., Sinha, M., England, R. & Tiley, R., 2003.
