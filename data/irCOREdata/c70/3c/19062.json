First, we set out \nthe socio-political context for enhancing the democratic governance of regulatory \npolicies in Europe, and highlight the way in which civic participation and democratic \nownership is given equal weight to economic competitiveness.  We then discuss the \npotential for institutionalised participatory governance to develop and their prospects \nfor improving effective and democratic governance in the multi-layered European \npolity.  The article concludes by outlining a research agenda for the field and \nidentifying the priorities for scholars working in interaction with civil society and \ngovernments.  \nDEMOCRATIC CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES\nThis article examines how institutional design can enhance democratic governance by \nbuilding new opportunities for participation by citizens in public policy, thus \nstrengthening their democratic ownership.  The state of democracy is a matter of \ndebate internationally, and particularly in the liberal democracies where traditional \nforms of representative government seem less able to respond effectively to the \nchanged social, economic and cultural conditions of societies (Cain et al 2006).  In \nEurope there are a special set of challenges in connecting the supranational \ninstitutions to citizens across almost thirty member states.  Despite the introduction of \ndirect election to the European Parliament, the Eurobarometer data shows that citizens \ndiffer considerably between member states in their attitudes to political mobilization \nat the European level and in their view of democracy.\n3Nevertheless, in recent years citizens themselves, social movements, and governments \nat multiple levels have initiated a number of democratic innovations.  These include \nnew forms of public participation, deliberative events drawing from Habermasian \ntheory of communicative action, interaction through network governance involving \ncitizens alongside government and business, and advanced techniques for opinion \npolling and interactive decision-making (Fung & Wright 2003; Edelenbos 2005; \nSmith 2005).  These may complement representative government by widening access \nto the formulation and making of public policy, but equally could offer a fundamental \nchallenge to the primacy of elected politicians (Klijn & Skelcher 2007; S\u00f8rensen & \nTorfing 2005).  \nThe position taken in this article is that the theory and practice of democratic policy \nmaking can be enhanced through detailed study of the institutional designs for citizen \nparticipation in a multi-level polity.  Institutional design refers to the development and \nembedding of rules and norms that enable and constrain actors\u2019 agency, whether this \nis a result of purposive action or evolving of patterns of behaviour.  It is important \nthat there is further development of relevant theories and methods in order to be able \nto grasp the role of institutional designs for the enhancement of civic participation and \ndemocratic ownership. We need to create new diagnostic tools in order to assess the \nconditions for citizen participation and measure the impact of participation on \neffective and democratic governance.  Last but not least, we must develop new \nexperimental research designs where key research findings serve as the basis for \nconcrete attempts to improve the functioning and impact of actual and ongoing \nprocesses of participatory governance. \nThis article initially sets out the European context.  It highlights the relevance of civic \nparticipation and democratic ownership for Europe\u2019s ambitions for stronger economic \ncompetitiveness.  We then discuss the potential for institutionalised forms of civic \nparticipation to develop and their prospects for improving the functioning of the \nEuropean polity.  We outline four types of institutional design \u2013 data gathering, \nopinion seeking, policy exploration, and interactive dialogue \u2013 and discuss the \nconditions for their application to policy making in Europe.  The article concludes by \nsetting out a research agenda for the field, identifying the priorities for scholars \nworking interactively with civil society and governments.  \n4EFFECTIVE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE OF EUROPE\nThe context for democratic governance in Europe is highly complex.  Although bound \nby a common history, close economic ties and a joint adherence to democratic \npolitical values, the European countries are politically diverse as they have different \nstate structures and degrees of devolution, different political and civic cultures, \ndifferent traditions for involvement of citizens and stakeholder in public policy, and \npopulations with varying levels of social capital and political empowerment.  Some \nEuropean countries are unitary states whereas others are federal systems, and the \nmajority of countries are members of the European Union that aims to spur economic, \nsocial and political integration, and in so doing adds a new institutional level that in \ndifferent ways interact with the national, regional and local levels found in the \nmember states.  \nEurope is increasingly constructed as a \u2018community of destiny\u2019 facing tough \ncompetition from other regional powers in the globalized knowledge economy.  In \nresponse to this challenge the EU has formulated the highly ambitious goal that \nEurope is to become the most competitive and dynamic innovation region in the \nworld.  In some parts of the world the enhancement of structural competitiveness is \nobtained through autocratic rule, suppression of fundamental democratic rights, and \npolitical emphasis on obedience and discipline.  However, in the European context it \nis an explicit goal that the enhancement of structural competitiveness must go hand in \nhand with a reinforcement of core values about democratic participation and \nownership.  The achievement of the twin-goals of enhancing competitiveness and \nreinforcing democratic values is a daunting task that puts a tremendous pressure on \npublic authorities at all levels, which are already struggling with severe and persistent \nlegitimacy problems due to their failure to solve a whole series of socio-economic \nproblems such as unemployment and economic decline, inner city decay, poor \nintegration of ethnic minorities, persistent gender inequalities and alarming climate \nchanges.  The public decision makers in local, regional and national governments, and \nwithin the EU, must deliver an effective and democratic governing of the European \nsocieties, but they are facing a series of problems and challenges that may jeopardize \ntheir efforts and performance. \n5Challenges to effective governance in Europe\nEffectiveness is hampered by the concurrence of rapidly growing expectations and \nlimited public resources.  The emergence of a global risk society strengthens the \ndemand for public governance and regulation, and public governance is increasingly \nexpected to be knowledge-based, proactive, strategic, responsive, flexible and \ntargeted.  At the same time, the available public resources at the EU-level and in the \nmember states are limited, especially as a result of enlargement resulting in increased \nregional disparities and fiscal constraints.  As such, national, regional and local \ngovernments across Europe suffer from serious overload problems.  In order to find a \nway out of this impasse, public authorities are increasingly attempting to mobilize the \nknowledge, resources and energies of relevant and affected actors from the private \nsector, while trying to transform citizens from demanding consumers of public \nservices to responsible co-producers of governance (Newman 2005; Olsen 2003).\nEffectiveness is also hampered by the institutional and cultural fragmentation of \nEurope and the European societies.  Modern society is becoming functionally \ndifferentiated into a large number of institutionalized subsystems and socio-political \norganizations (Mayntz 1989).  The institutional fragmentation is reinforced by a \ngrowing individualization, the prevalence of post materialist values and the \nemergence of new risks that create new horizontal lines of political conflict (Beck \n1997).   \nIn addition, the national political systems seem to have lost their privileged position as \nthe undisputed centre of economic and societal governance. Old and new political \npowers and responsibilities are shifted upwards to transnational authorities, \ndownwards to regional and local authorities and outwards to quasi-autonomous \nagencies, private enterprises and voluntary organizations.  The resulting governability \nchallenge is being mitigated by the formation of new forms of horizontal and vertical \ncoordination that bring the relevant and affected actors from the public and private \nsectors together in processes of negotiated governance and concrete problem solving \n(Piattoni 2009).  \nFinally, effectiveness is hampered by wicked problems that are characterized by a \nhigh degree of substantive uncertainty and strategic complexity (Koppenjan & Klijn \n62004).  Many policy problems are \u2018wicked\u2019 in the sense that there is a blurred \nconception of the problem, specialized knowledge is required, the number of \nstakeholders is high and so is the risk of conflicts.  The proliferation of wicked \nproblems makes it difficult for public authorities to solve the urgent problems faced \nby citizens and private firms and further sustain the need for crosscutting negotiation \namong public authorities, citizens, organized stakeholders and experts.\nChallenges to democratic governance in Europe\nThe ambition of governments to engage with citizens is taking place in a context \nwhere traditional forms of representative democracy are undermined by civic \ndisengagement and apathy.  This shows itself in the decline in voter turn out, party \nmembership and participation in community activities and public affairs (Mair & van \nBiezen 2001; Niemi & Weisberg 2001).  The European Social Survey (2006) reveals \nthat the citizens in Europe have little trust in the elected politicians and only score \n3.43 on a weighted index ranging from zero to ten when ten is the highest possible \ntrust.  In addition, Eurobarometer (2008) shows that fewer than a third of the citizens \nin Europe consider that their voice count in the EU, while only a quarter consider that, \non European issues, their voice is listened to by the European parliament or their \nnational government.  \nOne of the key explanations for this \u2018democratic disenchantment\u2019 is that \nrepresentative democracy, which is supposed to solve the problem of how to actively \ninvolve the people in modern mass societies in popular self-government, gradually \nhas turned into an impediment of democracy.  First, dialogue between the voters and \ntheir elected representatives are limited.  The latter are captured by political elites and \nstrong interest groups and the former are treated as customers, who communicate with \nthe elected elites through opinion polls and electronic market research processes.  \nSecond, the main influence of citizens as voters is on the input-side of the political \nsystem, leaving the output-side to be governed by public administrators who have \nincreasing scope for influencing policy due to the increased use of delegation and \ndevolution, but often lack detailed knowledge of citizens\u2019 life-worlds and are difficult \nto hold accountable for their decisions.  Third, attempts to supplement representative \ndemocracy through direct citizen engagement at the European level, as in the \nreferendums on the proposed Constitution, have not been successful.  Instead of \n7stimulating a constructive political debate about salient political issues where pro and \ncons are carefully weighted, the EU referendums have only allowed citizens to \nexpress their views on isolated constitutional issues and have provided a means of \nexpressing discontent with national governments.\nDemocracy is also challenged at its root since the current \u2018deterritorialization\u2019 of \npolitics and governance problematizes the idea of a unified people defined by clear \nnational boundaries.  The congruence between the level and source of public \ngovernance and the people affected by public regulations has weakened.  There is a \ngrowing displacement of power and authority to international policy regimes,\ntransnational organizations, regional and local authorities, and different sorts of cross-\nborder regions.  There are also examples of policy areas with competing and \noverlapping jurisdictions and many examples of policy problems that seem to fall in \nan institutional void (Hajer 2003).  At the same time, the homogenizing concept of \n\u2018the people\u2019 is being problematized by migration that increases the number of non-\nnational residents, immigrants and ethnic minorities, and by postmodern ideas that \nseem to spur the formation of new and multiple forms of identity.  The result of this \ngrowing heterogenization is that the \u2018people\u2019 can no longer be taken for granted.  \nInstead of a tendentially unified demos we have plurality of demoi that must be \nconstructed and connected in and through participatory forms of governance (Bohman \n2005).\nDebating the democratic challenges\nToday, the governance of the different societies, economies and political communities \nin Europe involves a complex and dynamic interaction among a plethora of \ntransnational, national, regional and local authorities and a host of private actors \n(citizens, civil society associations, businesses) within a multi-level governance \nsystem (Bache & Flinders 2005).  The performance of this multi-layered and tangled \ngovernance system is hampered by the persistent lack of democratic legitimacy.  \nDemocratic participation in public governance is found wanting and critics complain \nthat Europe is still suffering from high unemployment, regional disparities, \nenvironmental problems, and a general failure to meet the challenges posed by the \nglobalized, technology-driven risk society.  Hence, the legitimacy problem consists \nboth of a failure to ensure an adequate level and quality of democratic participation \n8(\u2018input legitimacy\u2019) and a failure to deliver effective solutions to pressing problems \nand challenges (\u2018output legitimacy\u2019) (Scharpf 1999).  These two gaps tend to weaken \nthe trust in the political system and the ownership of public policies by citizens.\nHowever, this is not a uniformly accepted view.  Leading scholars like Majone and \nMoravcsik have recently argued, first, that the EU should not be further democratized \nand, second, that expanding participation is unlikely to overcome political apathy.  \nMajone (1994, 1996) claims that the EU is essentially a regulatory state that produces \nPareto-improving policies with one unique solution.  A further democratization will \nonly lead to an unfortunate politicisation of issues that are better left to experts and \nindependent agencies to decide upon (Majone 1998).  Agreeing with this general \nwarning against a further democratization of the EU, Moravcsik (2002, 2003) goes on \nto argue that there is no point in trying to enhance participation in relation to EU \npolicies since the kind of issues that the EU addresses are not sufficiently salient for \nthe European citizens to take an interest in them. \nAlthough we recognize the need for caution in the debate about the \u2018democratic \ndeficit\u2019 in the EU, we retain the view that questions of democratic legitimacy and \nownership are important in a European context.  In contrast to Majone, we believe \nthat (re-) distributive policies gradually are gaining ground in the EU and that both \nregulatory and (re-) distributive policies call for the development of democratic \nprocedures that facilitate political contestation, ensure accountability and enhance the \nlegitimacy of the EU.  While (re-) distributive clearly create winners and losers, \nregulatory policies also advance some political projects and interests rather than \nothers.  In contrast to Moravcsik, we believe that the citizens\u2019 perception of the \nsalience of policy issues is likely to change if the media, the political parties and the \nvarious EU institutions begin to recognize the impact of EU regulation to high-\nsalience issues such as social security, health care, education, law and order, and \ntaxation and if the citizens were offered more opportunities to engage in the \nformulation and implementation of EU-related policies at the local, regional, national \nand transnational level (see also F\u00f8llesdal & Hix 2005).  Consequently our normative \nposition is that the EU polity as well as the national, regional and local governments \nin Europe need further democratization, not only by bringing traditional democratic \npolitics closer to the citizens, but also by bringing the citizens closer to public policy \n9making (Stoker 2006).  This normative position is not without its difficulties, \nincluding how citizens who may otherwise be disaffected from the representative \ndemocratic process can be mobilised, and the constraints imposed by existing \nstructures of state and corporate power.  We provide some pointers as to how \nproblems of realising civic participation and democratic ownership may be overcome \nthrough the institutional means we set out below, although a full treatment is beyond \nthe scope of this article.\nTHE POTENTIAL OF INSTITUTIONALISED PARTICIPATORY \nGOVERNANCE\nThe future success of the European project is conditional upon the development of \ninstitutional forms of empowered participation that can help to facilitate a more \neffective and democratic policy making within the multi-layered European polity.  \nConsequently, the constitutional forms of parliamentary democracy must be \nsupplemented with institutionalized forms of participatory.  While the former is based \non the citizens in their capacity of voters, the latter is based on citizens in their \ncapacity of stakeholders (Olsen 2003).\nThere are different implications for the design of democratic institutions if we \nconsider citizens-as-voters in contrast to citizens-as-stakeholders.  First, whereas the \ncivic and political entitlements of citizens-as-voters have strict territorial boundaries, \ncitizens-as-stakeholders are not bound to a particular territory and may try to \ninfluence decisions that are taken in territorial entities that do not recognize them as \ncitizens.  Second, whereas the influence of voters is confined largely to the input-side \nof the political system, the conception of stakeholder involves influence deeper within \nthe policy formulation, decision-making and implementation process.  This type of \ninvolvement engages with the throughput and output-side of the political system.  \nFinally, whereas voters are merely expected to make an informed choice between a \npre-given set of political candidates, stakeholders are expected to formulate their own \nopinions on different issues, engage in public deliberation over common problems and \njoint solutions, and mobilize their knowledge, resources and energies in the societal \ngovernance processes.\n10\nThe distinction between citizens-as-voters and citizens-as-stakeholders pushes the \ntraditional concept of the citizen as a passive, individual bearer of universal legal \nentitlements to its limits.  The concept of citizens-as-stakeholders is more collective, \nless inclusive, more pragmatic and outcome-oriented and has a clearer emphasis on \nactive engagement than the traditional notion of citizenship.  Nevertheless, the \nrecognition of citizens-as-stakeholders is based on a new kind of democratic right of \nthose collectivities or jurisdictions that are affected by particular policies to be present \nin the policy arena where the binding policy decisions are made (Skelcher 2005).  \nOur view is that the involvement of citizens-as-stakeholders in and through \ninstitutional forms of participation will contribute to a responsible production of \nrelevant policy outputs and outcomes through active engagement and democratic \ndeliberation.  As such, we propose that democratic participation of the citizens-as-\nstakeholders will facilitate and enhance new forms of empowered participatory \ngovernance that will both enable a better aggregation of relevant interests, ideas and \nresource and a better integration of the relevant and affected actors.  In other words, \nwe think that the functional justification for civic participation (to improve the \noperation of a complex European governmental system) will lead to, and also \npresupposes, the realisation of the republican justification (to promote an active and \ndemocratically educated citizenship capable of containing the power of elites).  \nOutside of the European context, these issues are further explored by Warren and \nPearse (2008).\nBut what is it actually that institutional forms of participation and empowered \nparticipatory governance can do in order to help ensure an effective and democratic \nresponse to pressing problems and new opportunities?  The literature in this field \nindicates a number of positive effects that institutional forms of participation may \nhave on the effectiveness of public policy: \n1. Effectiveness in the phase of policy initiation can be enhanced through a more \nprecise identification of needs and demands of affected actors; a negotiated \ndefinition of problems and challenges in the face of uncertainty; and the \nfacilitation of negative and positive coordination among relevant and affected \nactors across sectors, policy areas, levels and countries.\n11\n2. Effectiveness in the phase of policy selection can be enhanced through the \nmobilization of the knowledge and ideas of the participating actors; the \nreduction, or managing, of conflicts through mutual learning; and the \ndevelopment of mutual trust that permits the overcoming of the negotiators \ndilemma.\n3. Effectiveness in the phase of policy implementation can be enhanced through \nthe exchange of information and resources; the augmentation of programme \nresponsibility and voluntary compliance through empowered participation; \nand the production of strategic, proactive and responsive policy adjustments \nthrough continuous negotiations (Koppenjan & Klijn 2004; Provan & Milward \n2001; Scharpf 1993; S\u00f8rensen & Torfing 2007).\nThe list of the democratic merits of institutional forms of participation is equally long: \n1. Democracy can be deepened by enhancing participation at the output-side of \nthe political system through the availability and use of different institutional \nforms of collective and individual participation; the selective activation of \ndifferent groups of citizens; and the empowerment of the participating actors \nthrough the enhancement of their resources, rights, competences and know-\nhow and a transformation of their identity.\n2. Democracy can be deepened by enhancing deliberation through the \nconstruction of horizontal links between different demoi; through the \nestablishment of an active, informed and continuous interaction between \npoliticians, civil servants and citizens based on negotiated rules, norms and \nvalues; and the stimulation of public debates based on insights gained through \nparticipation and policy interaction.\n3. Democracy can be deepened by enhancing accountability through the \nrecruitment, mobilization and education of political sub-elites that can \ncompete with the established elites and hold them to account; through the \ndevelopment of new forms of horizontal accountability; and through a \nwidening of the scope for discursive contestation (Bohman 2005; Dryzek \n2000; Etzioni-Halevy 1993; Fung and Wright 2003; Hirst 2000; March & \nOlsen 1995; Sandel 1996; Schillemans 2008)\n12\nIn sum, it seems reasonable to expect that the institutional forms of participation can \nhelp to enhance both input and output legitimacy.  In addition, it might be argued that \ninstitutional forms of participation, depending on their particular form and \nfunctioning, also carry the potential for enhancing throughput legitimacy by means of \nincreasing citizens\u2019 understanding of how and why public policies are adopted and \nwho are responsible for them (Grote & Gbikpi 2002).\nTHE PROSPECTS FOR INSTITUTIONALISED PARTICIPATORY \nGOVERNANCE \nThe reinvigoration of institutionalized forms of democratic participation is not an easy \ntask.  First, large inequalities in education and wealth will often make it extremely \ndifficult to ensure an equal participation and influence.  Hence, participation might \nincrease, but it might not include all relevant and affected sections of society.  \nSecond, a major obstacle to participation and influence is that the problems and issues \nthat trouble people\u2019s daily lives are often caused, or at least, influenced by distant \nnational, transnational and global forces and dynamics, which are difficult to affect \nthrough popular participation.  Third, in a time where hierarchical top-down \ngovernment is reinforced by New Public Management (NPM) reforms that urge \npoliticians not to deal with the details of policy implementation and tell civil servants \nnot to worry about policy formulation (Osborn & Gaebler 1993), it is difficult to see \nhow the public authorities can engage in a meaningful policy dialogue with citizens-\nas-stakeholders. The politicians are removed from the arenas where public policies are \nimplemented and evaluated by the citizens, and if the latter want to influence the \ncontent and delivery of public policy they must interact with public administrators \nwho are not supposed to deal with policy formulation.  Hence, the neo-Weberian and \nneo-Wilsonian NPM-discourse, which aims to separate politics and administration, \ndoes not square well with a neo-Tocquevillean participatory democracy that aims to \ninvolve citizens in public deliberation about both the means and ends of public policy \n(Kettl 2002). \nNevertheless, there are also some important promises for the future that should be \nconsidered.  Due to its relatively decentralized administrative structure and its \npolitical and cultural multiplicity, Europe offers a broad field for experimentation \n13\nwith new modes of civil society participation.  In many countries, regions and\nlocalities, traditional forms of democratic representation through elections and \npopular referenda have been complemented by innovative forms of civic \nparticipation.  At the local level, traditional welfare state issues like social policy, \nemployment policy, preventive health plans and urban development are relatively \nopen for political participation through the construction of local partnerships, \ngovernance networks and user boards. At the regional and national level, civil society \norganisations are often consulted about most of the re-distributive policy areas, \nespecially in relation to large reform initiatives. \nWithin the EU civil society participation has received an increasing attention since the \nadoption of The Treaty of Amsterdam (European Council 1998) that stipulates that \n\u2018the Commission should [\u2026] consult widely before proposing legislation\u2019.  This \nstipulation was in 2001 followed by the White Paper on European Governance\n(European Commission 2001a), which aimed to define criteria for good governance \nby emphasizing core values in terms of openness, participation, accountability, \neffectiveness and coherence.  One of the working groups preparing the White Paper \nhighlighted the citizens\u2019 participation in different kinds of networks in their report on\nNetworking People for a Good Governance in Europe (European Commission, \n2001b).  The white paper was further supported by a scientific report on Governance \nin the European Union (Schutter et al 2001) in which leading political theorists called \nfor a procedural approach to public governance based upon participation and \nconsultation. In 2002 the Commission adopted the General Principles and Minimum \nStandards for Consultation (European Commission 2002) that had been proposed in \nthe White Paper. Procedures for online consultation with civil society were developed \nas a part of the Interactive Policy-Making Initiative (European Commission 2003). \nLast but not least, it should be noted that the draft treaty of a Constitution for Europe \n(European Council 2004) in Art. 47 states that: \u2018The institutions shall, by appropriate \nmeans, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known \nand publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action, [\u2026 and] maintain an \nopen, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil \nsociety\u2019.  This signals a clear commitment to the development of a more participatory \ngovernance style in the EU.\n14\nAlthough the EU Constitution is now dead, much of its spirit and content has survived \nin the new Lisbon Treaty, which is about to become ratified.  As such, the attempt to \ncodify the principles of participatory governance will survive as the EU needs to \nenhance its input, output and throughput legitimacy.  This further evidenced by the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate (2005) that has \ntriggered a number of experiments with Citizen Conventions and the recent White \nPaper on a European Communication Policy (European Commission 2006) that calls \nfor the empowerment of the citizens through increased participation and interaction \nand underlines the need \u2018to do the job together\u2019 via a partnership involving all key \nactors: the EU institutions, regional and local level authorities, political parties and \ncivil society organizations.\nIn sum, there is little doubt that civil society participation flies high on the political \nagenda and that participatory governance is conceived as an important tool for \nboosting the legitimacy of the EU.  It is frequently argued that the way of organising \ncivil society participation should be context-sensitive and should facilitate collective \nlearning into to take local and regional conditions into account (Banthien et al 2003), \nbut in academic research there has been paid far too little attention to the important \nquestion of how the institutional forms of participation should be designed in order to \nenhance participation, democratic ownership, and effective and democratic \ngovernance. \nINSTITUTIONAL DESIGN FOR PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE\nBoth the literature on political parties and elections and the research on collective \naction and civic engagement tend to focus on individual and collective behaviour: \nwho participate, why, how, and how much? (van Deth 1997; Verba et al 1995; Webb \net al 2002)  By contrast, we shall here focus on the role and impact of institutional \ndesign (covering procedures, mechanisms, tools and arenas) for stimulating \nparticipation, shaping the experiences of the participating actors and producing \nrelevant and feasible outcomes (see Fung 2003, 2006).  It is well established in the \nacademic literature that participation must be reiterated over time and supported by \ninstitutional rules, norms and procedures in order to have a positive effect on the \nparticipants in terms of increasing political empowerment, mutual learning and \nintegration of interests and ideas into innovative and sustainable solutions (Koppenjan \n15\n& Klijn 2004).  One-off participation will not produce any such effects.  Only \ninstitutional forms of participation with a certain extension in time and space can do \nthe trick. \nHowever, there are gaps in the knowledge base about how and why different \ninstitutional forms of participation contribute the enhancement of empowered \nparticipation and democratic ownership.  To compensate this neglect, we must open \nthe \u2018black-box\u2019 of the institutional forms of participation and analyse the internal \ndynamics of the institutions of participatory governance in order to account for their \nformation, functioning and impact.  We must analyse how institutional forms of \nparticipation are formed, how they operate, and how they affect the actions of social \nand political actors by providing particular incentives and defining a particular logic \nof appropriateness in terms of specific identities, roles, obligations, norms, and rules \n(March & Olsen 1995).\nThere are many different institutional forms of participation (Fung 2006) and they are \nconstantly transformed due to institutional atrophy, changing conditions, contingent \nmutations, or strategic interventions of social and political entrepreneurs (Barnes et al\n2003; Skelcher et al 2005).  It is important to capture the unique and changing \ncharacter of the institutional forms of participation.  A frequently used conceptual \ntaxonomy is Arnstein\u2019s (1969) famous \u2018ladder of citizen participation\u2019.  Arnstein \nranks a number of participatory mechanisms according to how much the citizens are \nallowed to participate and how much influence they get.  As such, the ladder \njuxtaposes powerless citizens with the powerful in order to highlight the fundamental \ndifference between them.  Distinguishing between different degrees of participation \nand influence is crucial, but the problem with Arnstein\u2019s ladder is that the highest \nrung is \u2018citizen control\u2019, defined as a situation where citizens govern a program, or an \ninstitutional setting, and are in full charge of all political and managerial aspects.  This \nnormative ideal is highly problematic since complete popular self-governance is not a \nfeasible option in the increasingly complex, fragmented and multi-layered European \npolity in which interdependency among a plurality of public and private actors \nconstitute an indispensable condition for public governance. \n16\nIn developing an institutional taxonomy to match today\u2019s complex and pluri-centric \nsociety, we distinguish among four broad institutional forms of participation:\n1. Data gathering through public surveys\n2. Opinion seeking through public consultation\n3. Policy exploration through deliberative forums, and\n4. Interactive dialogue through governance networks. \nOur purpose in identifying these different institutional designs is to facilitate a more \ndetailed discussion of their normative application and the research challenges for \nscholars who want to explore their contribution to an effective and democratic \ngovernance of contemporary societies.  There are many concrete examples of these \ndifferent institutional designs, but we shall here content ourselves to a brief outline of \nthe general format and the typical forms of the four institutional designs.\n1. Data gathering through public surveys \nElected politicians and public administrators at different levels sometimes become \ninformed about the citizens\u2019 needs and opinions on various issues through small- or \nlarge scale opinion polls.  Although public surveys based on opinion polls tend to \nresult in a highly controlled and restricted one-way communication with a very \nlimited direct impact on political decisions, the subsequent publication of survey \nresults, or the use of deliberative polls (Fiskin 1995), tend to create less controlled and \nmore interactive \u2018mini publics\u2019 in terms of sustained dialogues among citizens, \npoliticians and experts that sometimes give rise public demands for a popular \nreferendum.  Typical forms of information gather include: Web-based user \nsatisfaction surveys; opinion polls about people\u2019s satisfaction with public services and \nfacilities, their conception of different policy problems, or their reactions to new \npublic initiatives; and deliberative polls about large scale infrastructure projects or \nethical issues.\n2. Opinion seeking through public consultation  \nPublic authorities often consult with relevant and affected civil society organisations \nand local citizen groups, either on the initiative of the public authorities who aim to \nsecure support for new policies or on the initiative of civic stakeholders who want to \n17\nbe heard and gain influence on public governance.  The stakeholders receive \ninformation about new policy initiatives and express their views and preferences \nabout these within a certain deadline.  The stakeholders\u2019 comments may either be \nsubmitted as a written response to particular consultation documents or presented \nface-to-face in public meetings.  Electronic submission devices and\/or internet-based \nposting and discussion boards might support the written procedure.  Typical forms of \nopinion gathering include: written procedures that can be open or selective in terms of \nparticipation; open hearings organized as large public meetings with all civil society \nstakeholders; and closed hearings organized as public enquiries where public decision \nmakers discuss with a focus group consisting of different stakeholders. \n3. Policy exploration through deliberative forums\nA randomly selected group of individual citizens, or a politically selected group of \ncivil society organisations, are sometimes invited to participate in a structured \ndialogue with each other and with relevant experts and policy makers about sensitive \npolicy issues in order to produce relevant and informed policy advice.  Public \nauthorities often set up deliberative forums, but they may also be arranged by semi-\npublic agencies, private think tanks, or large civil-society organizations.  Deliberative \nforums and other forms of policy exploration are normally organized as face-to-face \nmeetings, but the Internet may facilitate input from experts and policy makers.  \nTypical forms of policy exploration include: citizen forums, planning cells and citizen \njuries; future- or scenario-workshops; and consensus conferences.\n4. Interactive dialogue through governance networks\nInterdependent, but operationally autonomous, actors from the public and private \nsector interact through relatively self-regulated negotiations in order to identify policy \nproblems, formulate policies and\/or implement joint solutions. These interactions are \noften termed policy or governance networks (S\u00f8rensen & Torfing 2007).  The \nnegotiated interaction may be either bilateral or multilateral and may either take the \nform of face-to-face encounters or communication via e-mail, web pages, restricted \non-line discussion realms, video conferences, etc.  Typical forms of interactive \ndialogue include:  permanent monitoring and advisory committees with citizen \nparticipation; formally organized foresight-, policy-, or implementation-networks; \nself-grown citizen networks formed in relation to particular policy issues.\n18\nAnalysing the institutional designs\nAs we move through the four institutional designs for participatory governance, the \ninvolvement of citizens individually and organized as civil society associations \nbecomes both more demanding and more institutionalized.  The participating citizens \nare asked to commit more time, resources and energy to the participatory arenas and \nthe more and more sustained interaction among public and private actors is not only \nregulated by formal rules and procedures, but also gives rise to jointly formulated \nnorms, values and perspectives of a more informal character.  At the same time, the \npotential influence of the participants also tends to increase.  Since programme \nresponsibility tends to be positively correlated with the degree of political influence, \ncitizens\u2019 commitment to the realization of joint decisions also tends to increase when \nwe move from the first to the last design.  Table 1 compares the four different \ninstitutional forms of participation in relation to the type of citizen, the form of \nparticipation, the degree of institutionalization, and the degree of popular influence.  \nThe different participatory designs distribute themselves along a continuum from \ncitizens as individuals to civil society associations, a continuum from passive to active \nparticipation, a continuum from low to high institutionalization, and a continuum \nfrom low to high political influence. \n----- Table 1 about here -----\nAlthough interactive dialogue scores high on all the key variables we cannot conclude \nthat governance networks are the best way of enhancing citizen-as-stakeholder \nparticipation.  Not only are instruments such as governance networks difficult to \ninitiate, sustain and terminate, but also it is difficult to ensure the participation of \nindividual citizens who are not organized in formal associations and organizations and \ncivil society organisations.  In addition, governance networks often suffer from the \nlack of transparency and accountability.  As such, the choice of the right mechanism \nfor democratic participation is complex and depends on the national and institutional \nlegacies, the actual circumstances, the level of government, the time horizon, the \n19\ncontent of the policy issues at stake, and the kind of actors one seeks to involve. \nNevertheless, there is a marked shift in the forms of participation and the degree of \npopular control, when we move from data gathering via opinion seeking to policy \nexploration and interactive dialogue.  As such, we might conclude that the last two \ncases provide relatively good opportunities for empowered participatory governance\n(Fung & Wright 2003)  \nFrom the point of view of the civic stakeholders, the institutional forms of \nparticipation provide important channels for empowered participation and a \npossibility for exerting political influence on the governing of society and the \neconomy.  Empowered participation is defined as active participation of actors who \npossess relevant resources and competences, a sufficient understanding of the issue at \nhand, and an identity that prescribe participation (March & Olsen 1995).  Political \ninfluence concerns the ability to affect actual decisions, the political agenda, the rules \nof the game within a certain policy areas, and the underlying discourses that enable \nthe actors to produce particular understandings and navigate politically (Torfing \n2009). \nFrom the point of view of governments, the central question becomes how to choose, \ndesign, sustain and develop \u2013 or in short metagovern \u2013 the institutional forms of \nparticipation, which are initiated by public and\/or private policy entrepreneurs \n(Kickert et al 1997; Kooiman 2003; Koppenjan & Klijn 2004; Jessop 2002; Rhodes \n1997).  Metagovernance involves the governance of participatory forms of \ngovernance through reflexive choices and interventions that involve the following \nquestions:\n1. Is participatory governance appropriate in a given context and situation?\n2. If yes, which of the four institutional forms of participation should be used, \nfacilitated, or supported, and how should it be designed?\n3. How should it be framed legally, economically, politically and discursively? \n4. How to facilitate empowered participation of relevant and affected citizens \nand civil society organisations? \n5. How to manage and reduce eventual conflicts? \n20\n6. How should the public authorities respond to the results and outcomes of the \nparticipatory process? \n7. Finally, to what extent, how and in what capacity should the public authorities \nparticipate in the process of participatory governance? \nIn principle, both public and private actors can exercise metagovernance, but the \nlegitimacy and special capacities of public authorities give them a lead (Klijn & \nKoppenjan 2000).  However, the ability of public authorities to metagovern the \ninstitutional forms of participation varies from case to case as it depends on whether \nparticipation is a result of top-down or bottom-up initiatives.  Moreover, \nmetagovernance is constrained by the self-regulating character of the institutional \nforms of participation, which tends to increase when we move from data gathering to \ninteractive dialogue. \nAnother crucial concern, still seen from the governments\u2019 point of view, is to what \nextent the institutional forms of participation enhance the democratic ownership of \ndifferent kinds of citizens in terms of individuals, groups and associations.  In the lack \nof a well-established scientific definition of the term, we shall define democratic \nownership as the participants\u2019 feeling of being an integral part of the formulation and \nimplementation of policy solutions.  Inspired by the civic tradition and literature on \ncorporatism, we shall propose that the feeling of being an integral part of the process \nthrough which binding decisions are made is a function of:\n1. The participants\u2019 confidence in their own ability to influence decisions \n(internal efficacy)\n2. The participants\u2019 perception of the political systems responsiveness (external\nefficacy)\n3. The participants\u2019 assessment of the fairness of the participatory process \n(procedural justice)\n4. Their commitment to the implementation of joint decisions, despite of \neventual conflicts and grievances (programme responsibility).\nWe do not expect any nice co-variation among these measures of democratic \nownership different kinds of trade-offs are likely to occur.  Hence, as we move from 1 \n21\nto 4, the criteria for measuring democratic ownership are becoming stricter and more \nexclusive.  Being confident in one\u2019s own capacities to influence decisions is one thing \nand is clearly not as demanding as being committed to decisions one might disagree \nwith.  Consequently, democratic ownership is a matter of degree rather than all or \nnothing as civic participants are not likely to score equally high on all four \ndimensions.\nThe production of democratic ownership is crucial since it tends to construct the \ncitizen-as-stakeholder as a responsible co-producer of governance rather than as an \nirresponsible and demanding policy taker who feel alienated from public policy \nmaking.  However, the production of democratic ownership might vary among \nindividuals, groups and civil society associations as it depends on the ability of the \nparticipating actors to influence public policy, which in turn depends on their social, \npolitical, and cultural capital.  As such, there is a risk that participation will generate \ndemocratic ownership for the resourceful participants while alienating the less \nresourceful participants such as immigrants, minorities, women, young people and \npeople with low income and education. \nIn order to avoid treating the institutional forms of participation as a black box, we \nmust focus on their internal dynamics.  Three internal dynamics deserve a special \nattention. The first concerns the formation of a commonly accepted discursive and \ninstitutional framework, which facilitates and shapes the interaction between \nindividual citizens and citizens organized as associations of stakeholders on the one \nhand, and the policy experts, civil servants and elected politicians (Hajer 1993; Hajer \n& Versteeg 2005; Torfing 2007).  Without such a framework democratic participation \nmight result in Babel of voices that nobody listen to or understand.  Although \nstorylines, cognitive frames and institutional norms and rules are contested and \nsubject to hegemonic struggles, they tend to constitute a much needed reference point \nfor the inclusions and exclusion of participants, the advancement of legitimate claims \nand arguments, and sustained interaction among a plethora of social and political \nactors.\nThe second dynamic concerns the attempt to facilitate deliberation and the formation \nof compromise and consensus in the face of political conflicts and power struggles.  \n22\nConflicts and struggle is an irreducible aspect of politics and a driving force in policy \ninnovation.  Therefore, it is important to find ways of the making conflicts and \nstruggles compatible with a grammar of democratic conduct that seeks to transform \npolitical enemies into legitimate adversaries. Such an endeavour calls for \ninstitutionally mediated attempts to balance consensus and conflict through the \ncultivation of an ethos of agonistic respect (Mouffe 2005). \nThe third dynamic concerns the democratization of the institutional forms of \nparticipation so as to ensure that citizens-as-stakeholders are anchored in \nmetagoverning politicians; the groups and organizations that they claim to represent; a \ncritical public that scrutinizes the arguments and decisions of the participants; and in \nrelevant democratic norms and values that ensures inclusion, an open, passionate and \nresponsive deliberation, and equal influence on key decisions (S\u00f8rensen & Torfing \n2005). Democratization of the participatory processes is important since participation \nwithout democracy easily results in clientilism, oligarchy and private interest \ngovernment that tend to reduce input legitimacy. However, the prospect for the \ndevelopment of democratic forms of participation through democratic anchorage of \nthe participants and their interactions might weaken as we move upward from the \nlocal to the transnational level as the problems encountered at the local level tend to \naggravate.  Hence, the participatory arenas at the national and especially the \ntransnational level are often dominated by expert discourses, invisible to the general \npublic, inhabited by professional political actors with a limited contact to ordinary \ncitizens, and hard for the elected politicians to influence.  \nA RESEARCH AGENDA ON INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN AND \nPARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE\nThe development of new knowledge about the dynamics and impact of institutional \ndesigns of democratic and participatory governance is well under way (see Goodin & \nDryzek 2006; Hendriks et al 2007). A further enhancement of our understanding of \ninstitutional forms of participation requires scholars to address a number of \nchallenges.  First, research must adopt a multi-level perspective on democratic \nparticipation that aims to analyse the dynamic links among the local, regional, \nnational and transnational levels of participation.  The individual and organized \ncitizens who are capable of participating at all these levels link the different arenas.  \n23\nThe citizens\u2019 choice of level of participation depend on their assessment of where the \nbinding political decisions are made, their sense of political obligation and duty, and \ntheir perception of the costs and benefits of participating at a particular level.  The \ncitizens\u2019 experiences with participation at one level are also likely to affect their \nparticipation at other levels.  For example, negative experiences with participation at \nthe local level will either discourage further participation or encourage the citizens to \nseek other venues for political influence at either the regional, national or \ntransnational levels.  However, the dynamic links among the different levels are not \nonly a result of the experience-based choice of the citizens.  They are also a function \nof political preferences and experiences on the part of the public authorities that may \nfind that particular institutional forms of participation are suitable for particular levels \nof government.  As such, public authorities might construct different forms of \nparticipation, or embrace different forms of citizen-initiated participation, at different \nlevels of government.  Future research must both explore the dynamic links of multi-\nlevel participation from the perspective of the citizens and from the perspective of \npublic authorities.  The burning question is whether the citizens want to participate at \nthe level where the binding political decisions are made and how this participation is \nfacilitated and encouraged by public authorities.\nSecond, research should broaden knowledge by addressing a new set of questions \nconcerning: the ability of politicians, civil servants and other resourceful actors to \nmetagovern the institutional forms of participatory governance; the effect of the \ninstitutional forms of participation on the effectiveness of public policy; and the \nprospects for democratic innovation at the systemic level leading to the formation of a \npluricentric democracy based on the co-existence of competing democratic norms, \nvalues and institutions.  The attempt to address these crucial questions is premised on \na further integration of sociological theories of participation with political science \ntheories of policy, governance, effectiveness and democracy.  The unfortunate gulf \nbetween sociology and political science is a result of the split between the society-\ncentric view of sociology and the state-centric view of political science. Bridging this \ngulf is important in order to gain new insights about how the state in its different \nforms and contexts can facilitate and sustain institutional forms of participation that \npromote democratic ownership.  In other words, it will permit a connection between \nmacro and micro level perspectives on the analysis of participatory governance. \n24\nThird, at the level of methods, scholars should focus on constructing analytical tools \nfor assessing and improving the conditions for participation, measuring democratic \nownership, and evaluating the effectiveness and democratic quality of participatory \ngovernance.  The future development of the research on citizen participation and \ndemocratic participatory governance is hampered by the lack of clear methodological \nstandards and procedures for measuring the effectiveness and democratic quality of \nparticipatory governance (see S\u00f8rensen & Torfing, 2009).  Although there are many \nstudies of who participate, why and how, there are no systematic tools for assessing \nand improving the conditions for participation and for measuring the democratic \nownership produced by different forms of participation. \nFinally, scholars who are conducting research on democratic and participatory \ngovernance should aim to develop new and innovative forms of science-society \ninteraction that take us beyond the traditional divide between researchers who \nproduce knowledge and practitioners who apply knowledge.  There is urgent need for \ndeveloping a structured dialogue between researchers and practitioners that can help \nto improve participation and democratic ownership through institutional design.  An \ninteractive research strategy might benefit from design experiments that use real-life \ntesting grounds as a way of providing feed back on theoretically-informed research \nresults and improving concrete processes of participatory governance through trial \nand error in order to develop a situated knowledge about \u2018what works\u2019 (John & Stoker \n2008).  It could also develop and test prototypes that can be used by civic associations \nand citizen leaders who want to spur democratic innovation.  Last but not least, \ninteractive research can enhance the knowledge and competences of both researchers \nand practitioners in the field of participatory governance by facilitating \ntransdisciplinary learning.\nCONCLUSION\nThe desire to produce a more effective and democratic governing of the European \ncountries and other Western societies provides the political motivation behind the \nattempt to reinvigorate and develop institutional forms of participation.  The \ninstitutionalized forms of participation can help to improve the effectiveness of public \npolicy defined in terms of a well-informed identification of problems and \n25\nopportunities, a proactive choice of feasible solutions that goes beyond the least \ncommon denominator and avoids cost-shifting, a flexible implementation that tends to \nsolve urgent policy problems and exploit emerging policy opportunities, and the \nproduction and institutionalization of cognitive, strategic and institutional learning \n(S\u00f8rensen & Torfing 2009).  The effectiveness of public policy can be enhanced by \nadjusting and refining the public policy agenda through the use of data gathering \ninstruments; by providing relevant and specialized knowledge, information and \nassessments through forms of opinion seeking; by stimulating mutual learning and \nhandling political conflicts in and through policy exploration mechanisms; and by \nmobilizing resources and facilitating coordination through approaches to interactive \ndialogue. \nMore specifically, we think that adoption of the institutional forms of participation \nproposed in this article will have important democratic effects. The positive\ndemocratic effects will begin to resolve the practical problems inherent in our \nnormative approach to citizen participation and democratic ownership.  For example, \nthey will: contribute to the establishment of an intermediate level of sub-elites that \ncan challenge the dominant elites and enhance elite competition; help to establish \nvertical organizational links between governments and citizens and horizontal links \nbetween different social and political communities and identities; enhance democratic \nlegitimacy by facilitating political participation and influence on the output-side of the \npolitical system and horizontal accountability by promoting negotiated interaction \nbetween interdependent powers; and contribute to a widening of the scope for inter-\ndiscursive contestation and deliberation.  However, they might also have negative \ndemocratic effects in terms of giving rise to a biased and exclusionary participation, \ncreating a more opaque policy process, and hampering traditional forms of \naccountability.  A careful metagovernance might help to mitigate these negative \neffects.  \nThe enhancement of institutional forms of participation will not only have effects on \nthe existing forms of democracy, but might also spur democratic innovation by \nstrengthening democratic ownership of the institutional design process as well as the \nsubstantive matters of political debate.  Just as the design of European institutions is \nan evolving process of experimentation and negotiation without a single agreed end \n26\npoint, this may also be the case in the design of participatory arenas at other levels.  \nConsequently the idea of democratic innovation suggests the idea of governance as a \nprocess of emergence of different institutional arrangements through which public \npurpose is negotiated and realised, in a manner reminiscent of Casella and Frey \n(1992) as self-organising, functionally overlapping jurisdictions developed in contrast \nto the post-Westphalian norm of hierarchically organised and spatially exclusive \ngovernment.  \nAlthough our approach emphasises institutional solutions to the problems of civil \nparticipation throughout the policy process, we recognise that this is intimately \nconnected to political struggles that may be expressed in the material or discursive \nrealms.  Institutional design does not take place in a vacuum, but is an expression of \nwider political processes, which may generate compromises between actors or the \nexercise of authoritative rule by power holders.  Nevertheless, institutional change \nalso impacts back on these other realms of the political.  The interactions are not \nunidirectional, and so specific opportunities to redesign institutions in line with the \nagenda we set out will also shape citizens\u2019 understandings of the possibilities and \nconstraints that are open to them in engaging with government. \nStudying these issues in a European context provides an important site for learning \nbecause of the impact of European programmes that promote new forms of civic \nparticipation at multiple spatial scales.  There is an important task for scholars to see \ntheir specific studies within this broader agenda, and to build a knowledge base \nthrough exchange of ideas with citizen and governmental actors so that the normative \npossibilities proposed in this paper can be fully explored.\n27\nTable 1: Analysis of four types of institutional design for participatory governance\nInstitutional \ndesign\nData gathering through \npublic surveys\nOpinion seeking \nthrough public \nconsultation\nPolicy exploration \nthrough deliberative \nforums\nInteractive dialogue \nthrough governance \nnetworks\nType of citizen Mostly individual Individual and organized Individual and organized Mostly organized\nLevel of \nparticipation \nPassive Active, but non-\ncommittal\nActive and committal Highly active and \ncommittal \nInstitutiona-\nlization\nLow degree of \ninstitutionalization\nCertain degree of formal \ninstitutionalization\nConsiderable degree of \nformal and informal \ninstitutionalization\nHigh degree of formal \nand informal \ninstitutionalization\nInfluence of \nactors\nLow as there is no direct \nimpact on policy making, \nalthough citizens may \ntrigger public policy \nmaking \nRelatively low, but with \nunpredictable outcomes \nfor citizens as they may \nsucceed to veto new \npolicy initiatives\nConsiderable, and with \nunpredictable outcomes\nfor government as \ndeliberative processes are \ndifferent to control\nHigh and based on either \ninterest mediation or  co-\ngovernance\n28\nREFERENCES\nArnstein, Sherry R.
