Introduction59\n60\nFormerly, agricultural production was optimised almost exclusively for farm profit.61\nLatterly, however, farming has come under increasing pressure to meet environmental62\ntargets (Goulding et al., 2008). An imbalance between fertiliser supply and crop63\nofftake as well as soil erosion may lead to the loss of nutrients to air and water; sorbed64\npesticides may wash into natural waters, and energy consumption at all stages of65\nagricultural production contributes to global warming. If agricultural production is to66\nbe truly sustainable, it makes sense to weigh economic benefits against environmental67\nburdens and the consumption of resources. It is difficult to do this on a consistent68\nbasis without attributing a cash value to the environmental impacts, however.69\nImperfect though this is, we present methodology to make such a comparison in a70\ntransparent and objective way.71\n72\nGiven knowledge about the extent of farming in the UK, it is possible to approximate73\nthe contribution of each farming system to the total environmental burden. Pretty et al.74\n(2005a&b, 2003 and 2000) attributed environmental costs to the various components75\nof agriculture for the UK as a whole, Hartridge and Pearce (2001) reviewed the76\nenvironmental effects of farming in the UK in economic terms, and Atkinson et al.77\n(2004) examined the potential of monetised accounting of the environmental effects78\nof agriculture.79\n80\nEnvironmental Life Cycle Assessment, LCA, (http:\/\/www.iso-81\n14001.org.uk\/index.htm) seeks to take account of all the inputs to and outputs from a82\nproduction system in order to take a complete view within defined system boundaries.83\n5The primary inputs are traced far back along the production system: e.g. small84\ncomponents of oil extraction and refining or iron ore mining and steel production are85\nattributed to the annual use of a tractor in agricultural production. Costs in this sense86\nare taken to be environmental costs or burdens as well as financial costs. LCA87\nnormally assembles these separately into their own categories. Using such an88\napproach, Williams et al. (2006) have published a thorough LCA of several89\ncommodities produced within UK agriculture. Here we convert all LCA components90\ninto monetary units in order to express them on a single, economic basis.91\n92\nTotal Factor Productivity (TFP) is the ratio of the economic outputs from a system to93\nthe inputs (Lynam and Herdt, 1989; Ehui and Spencer, 1992; Barnett, 1994). Barnett94\net al. (1995) showed how this concept could be used to include environmental95\nconsiderations by attributing a cost to each of the resources and to the effects of each96\nburden on the environment. TFP is used as an index and normally calculated at the97\noptimum yield response.98\n99\nHigh-input farming is geared to achieving maximum profit. This often implies levels100\nof production just short of the physiological optimum response of the plant or animal101\nto inputs. Beyond this point, increasing inputs and therefore costs achieve small102\nincreases in yield only which are insufficient to pay for the extra inputs. This103\nsuggests, however, that in the region of this optimum substantial reductions in input104\nmight be achieved with little loss of yield or profit. Also, if one input, e.g. nitrogen is105\nreduced then less of other inputs may be needed. Despite much work on reduced-106\ninput farming, little has been done to establish the optimum level of reduction.107\nImplicit in this idea, however, is the assumption that the rate of consumption of108\n6environmental services and the rate of pollution reduce along with a decrease in the109\nrate of intensity.110\n111\nOur objective in this article is to develop and use methodology for estimating the112\noptimum level of all inputs in any given system of production that reduces as much113\nenvironmental pollution as possible for least consumption of resources within the114\nconstraint of maintaining farm income at as high a level as possible. We do this by115\nplotting TFP against the total inputs, including environmental inputs, and deduce the116\noptimum in the likely sustainability of each of several agricultural systems to be at the117\nmaximum of the curve. In doing so, we try to include estimates for the cost or value118\nof all components in a transparent way. Recent fluctuations in the costs of inputs and119\nfarm commodities persuaded us that the idea of a trend with time was meaningless120\nunless the variability is itself indexed (Lien et al., 2007). Accordingly we explore the121\nunderlying structure of sustainability in what is essentially a static measure of the122\ncomponents of farming that are likely to determine sustainability over time. All data123\nand calculations are included in spreadsheets that are available at124\nwww.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk\/aen\/TFP\/. If better values become available and are125\nagreed upon by the scientific community, the spreadsheets can be updated126\naccordingly. In addition, we analyse the make-up of the environmental costs and127\nshow how these change with changing intensity of farming.128\n129\n2. Methods130\n131\n2.1 Calculation system132\n133\n7A way of examining the sum economic value of an activity by expressing all134\ncomponents on the same basis, is to analyse the Total Factor Productivity (TFP;135\nBarnett et al., 1994). This is the value-weighted sum of the outputs from a farming136\nsystem divided by the cost-weighted sum of the inputs.137\n\uf0e5\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf03d n\ni\nii\nm\nj\njj\nXW\nQP\nTFP\n1\n1 [1]138\n139\nwhere Wi is the cost of each of n input factors used at rate Xi, and Pj is the value of140\neach of m outputs yielding a quantity Qj each. If TFP is greater than 1.0 and remains141\nso for a number of years a system can be said to be sustainable economically. The142\nindex can be used to assess the decline in viability or the progressive benefits of143\nadopting more sustainable practices, but presupposes that the intention is to continue144\nfarming and maintain the production of food, as we explain below. A purely145\neconomic analysis without factoring in the environmental costs would be biased146\n(Barnett et al., 1994). Therefore environmental costs, such as greenhouse gas (GHG)147\nemissions and nitrate leaching are factored in as additional input costs (Barnett et al.,148\n1995). The alternative of including them as output penalties might lead to a negative149\nvalue for the index. It should be noted that we classify farm support (i.e. subsidies) as150\nan output because it contributes to field income and therefore contributes to151\nprofitability. Support, either of production or of an environmentally beneficial152\nmeasure, is easily included as its financial incentive, P, in relation to unit153\nenvironmental target, Q. This provides a logical and straightforward way of154\ninvestigating the response of all outputs to all inputs, and enables us to assess the155\nimportance of such support to the sustainability of any system.156\n157\n8Responses change with inputs and it is our thesis that a maximum in the TFP versus158\ninputs graph can be found, i.e. that there is an optimal system. Since this value of the159\nTFP index and the input costs include the environmental burdens, the maximum160\nshould represent the optimum level of intensity of production that balances161\nenvironment with productivity. Note that the analysis proposed may not explain162\nfarming strategy since it is usually net profit (i.e. the difference between the163\nnumerator and denominator in Eq [1] multiplied by the volume but without the164\nenvironmental factors) that determines what a farmer does.165\n166\nLCA is defined for a system. Our system includes stages prior to the farm but167\nexcludes everything once the product is sold and leaves the farm; in other words168\ntransport, processing, packaging and distribution. Direct costs for the production of169\nagricultural chemicals are not included in our analysis because they are included in170\nthe price paid by the farmer and appear in the denominator of the TFP index. We171\ntherefore depart from the norm set for LCA . We do, however, apportion the172\nenvironmental costs of the GHGs emitted in the production of agricultural chemicals173\nand other environmental costs.174\n175\n176\n2.2 Environmental costs177\n178\nEconomists refer to costs that do not appear in their calculations as \u2018external\u2019.179\nExamples are the environmental burdens and uncosted consumption of resources.180\nBecause we wish to internalise these costs we refer to them as environmental costs181\nand have avoided the term external. Besides an analysis of the TFP response to182\n9inputs, we provide a breakdown of the individual environmental costs at different183\nrates of input. Indirect environmental costs, associated with chemical and machinery184\nproduction or the construction of buildings, are less easy to attribute and here we have185\nrelied on the LCA analysis of Williams et al. (2006). A full description of the data we186\nhave used and the ways in which we have processed them is too detailed to include in187\nthe main body of this article. Full details are provided in the supplementary188\ninformation included on the web with this article and in Williams et al. (2006). Only189\nthe essential elements are given below.190\n191\n2.2.1 Primary energy192\nThe prices of energy can be stated accurately. Direct energy costs for farm operations193\nwere set at those current at the end of January 2006 as detailed in the supplementary194\ninformation. These include fuel for machinery and electricity used in drying or195\ncooling harvested produce. Energy costs have risen sharply since that date, however.196\n197\nThe cost of embodied energy in indirect inputs is accounted for in their cash cost. The198\nenergy used for manufacturing fertilisers, pesticides or machinery for arable costs is199\nthus indirectly implied by their cost. The consumption of primary energy is thus200\nlimited to what we have called operational costs such as fuel to power tractors or the201\ndrying of harvested grain. On the other hand, environmental emissions associated202\nwith manufacture were given environmental costs using the emission values per unit203\ninput from Williams et al. 2006 and the costs of Pretty. The same argument applies to204\nfeeds imported to livestock farms.205\n206\n2.2.2. Pesticides, herbicides and other chemical control agents207\n10\nBesides the economic cost and environmental burden of producing these chemicals208\n(primary energy, etc.), their use is itself an environmental burden. We have estimated209\nthis burden as the sum of the costs of removing the compounds from drinking water,210\ncosts to farmers and the National Health Service of acute damage to human health,211\nand the cost of the loss of abundance and diversity of wildlife. The costs of pesticides212\nto human health are thought to have been considerably underestimated as they do not213\ninclude chronic effects (e.g. cancers) and acute effects may well be under reported214\n(Pretty et al. 2000). In contrast, however, Trewavas (2004) avers that exposure to215\nmanufactured pesticides and sprays is associated with lower rates of cancer than in the216\ngeneral population. Notwithstanding this debate, Pretty et al. (2005a and 2000)217\nestimate environmental costs of chemicals for the whole of the UK. We use their data,218\nexpressing them per hectare or per kg commodity by attributing the UK pesticide219\ncosts first of all to commodities based on their relative production rates and on the220\nmake up of a typical range of sprays used with each commodity, as explained in detail221\nin the appendix. Based on experimental results, cereal yields given by the Wheat222\nDisease Manager (Audsley et al. 2005) improve if sufficient amounts of bioicidal223\nchemicals of the correct kind are applied. We have chosen to invert this relationship224\nand so have derived the response at reduced applications. The national burden can225\nthen be partitioned to crops at different rates of input. Chemicals are assumed to be226\napplied even if fertilisers are not. Reductions in chemical inputs are obtained by227\nreducing the number of sprays and accepting some actual reduction or risk of228\nreduction in crop yield from weeds, pests and diseases. Reducing the concentration of229\nactive ingredient in a spray is not recommended because of the danger that the target230\nwill develop resistance. We have not, therefore, used reduced concentrations in our231\ncalculations.232\n11\n233\n2.2.3. Eutrophication234\nThe financial burden associated with nitrogen and phosphorus loss from agriculture235\nhas been expressed on a national basis by Pretty et al. (2005a&b 2003 and 2000,).236\nThis cost is partly the removal of the nutrients from drinking water but also of237\neutrophication, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and costs associated with the unsightly238\nappearance of algal blooms that diminish the value of water-side properties, of239\namenity and recreation, and thus also the tourist trade. These data were attributed to240\nfarming as a whole and related to current, average fertiliser and crop use on farms,241\nalthough we accept that a change in the use of P and to some extent N will be buffered242\nin soil and will not immediately be reflected in emissions. The LCA norm assumes243\nequilibrium conditions (i.e. projecting the outcomes of long-term farm practices) so244\nour results must be seen as reflecting steady-state rather than the more dynamic results245\nof an alteration to land-use or farming practice.246\n247\n2.2.4. Global warming248\nThe main GHGs carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4 and nitrous oxide, N2O are all249\nemitted during agricultural production and to varying extents during the manufacture250\nof inputs used in production. A large variation can be seen in the published values of251\nGHG emissions and burdens (Table 1, Hartridge and Pearce 2001; Pretty et al. 2005a;252\nClarkson and Deyes, 2002; Atkinson et al. 2004). The latter two sets of authors argue253\nthat damage done by the longer-lived gases should not be referred to a global254\nwarming potential (GWP) of CO2 equivalents, because the reference gas, CO2 itself255\nchanges in concentration with time. To do so would inflate the value of a shorter-256\nlasting gas such as methane. On the other hand the cost of damage today will be less257\n12\nthan damage in future under the assumption that inflation consistently reduces the258\nvalue of money, thus inflating the economic damage of longer-lasting gases in todays\u2019259\nterms. We use the estimates of the economic damage from GHG emission given by260\nAtkinson et al. (2004). A small allowance is made for methane oxidation by soil.261\nStrictly this should be given as an ecosystem service (section 2.2.5) but is already262\nincluded in calculations within our source data (Williams et al, 2006).263\n264\n2.2.5. Land-use265\n266\nIt is essential to take account of the area of land used in production because, although267\na less intensive system may pollute less on a per hectare basis, it requires more land268\narea to produce the same amount of food. If extra land is needed to produce food with269\nless pollution, where will that land come from and what will it cost? We have valued270\nland using Costanza et al\u2019s (1997) ecosystem services approach. Cropland, grassland271\nand temperate forest are given values for their environmental benefit, but we have272\ndiscounted the value of their food and fibre production given by these authors because273\nthis residual benefit, for say cropland, is attributed to production in our analysis; that274\nis to say it is included as an output in the numerator of the TFP index (Eq. 1). The275\ncost is added to the denominator and is calculated from the value of the area of land276\nlost from the substitute system: in all cases we assume forest is converted to277\nagricultural land. To an extent, the value of land is included in an orthodox economic278\nanalysis because the land will cost a farm business rent or interest. These direct costs279\nare included in our analysis. If more land is needed, we charge at the rate attributed to280\nthe ecosystem services provided by temperate forest (Costanza et al., 1997). We then281\nproceed to analyse the system in two ways. Firstly, in estimating the cost of the282\n13\nconsumption of land on a per hectare basis, we give the extra cost relative to the land-283\nuse at the optimum economic return, i.e. the marginal increase in land use. Thus land-284\nuse at optimum has a value of zero attributed to it on a per hectare basis. This is285\nbecause we assume in our analysis that food-production at current rates is necessary286\nand we refer our results to this norm. Secondly, however, in expressing the results on287\na per tonne of production basis, we give the actual ecosystem service cost attributed288\nby Costanza et al (1997) to the land consumed in order to produce each tonne of that289\ncommodity.290\n291\n2.3. Response to inputs292\n293\nThe well-known law of diminishing returns applies to crop production (e.g. Addiscott294\net al., 1991). Most usually this is seen with respect to nutrients and to nitrogen295\nfertiliser in particular. We modelled crop yield using a response curve derived from296\nthe Quadmod system (ten Berge et al., 2000) because this links nitrogen uptake with297\nresponse and application rate. The choice of a different response curve might make a298\nsmall difference to the amounts of yield. We have re-parameterised Quadmod for the299\narable crops used in this analysis with data from our own experiments in the UK, as300\ndetailed in the supplementary information. Where our study has concentrated on301\nfarming close to the economic optimum, the calculations include benefits from302\neconomies of scale and we have used data pertaining to efficient production (e.g.303\nABC, 2005; Nix, 2005).304\n305\nExtensification of ruminant systems was modelled by changing nitrogen fertiliser306\ninput to the grazing system and modifying the stocking rate to ensure a constant307\n14\nliveweight gain per head. The import of concentrates per unit grazed area was308\nadjusted in proportion to the change in stocking rate. Thus, diets were not changed.309\n310\n3. Results311\n312\nWe deal with the commodities in two groups: arable crops and finishing of ruminant313\nmeat.314\n315\n3.1 Arable crops316\n317\n3.1.1. Wheat318\nIn Fig 1a we plot the wheat grain yield (tonnes ha-1) and TFP index against total costs319\n(variable, fixed and environmental). Our TFP index has a broad maximum at a cost of320\nabout \u00a320-25 ha-1 less than that needed to obtain the physiological maximum. Note321\nthat this saving is largely in environmental benefits and not a reduction in farmer\u2019s322\ncosts. The reason for the lack of a sharp peak is to be found in the environmental costs323\n(Fig 1b). Although these are small in relation to income and production costs, the324\nincreased need for extra land to maintain production with reduced inputs increases the325\nsum of the environmental costs at the lower levels compared with optimum326\nproduction. At its maximum, the TFP index is above one, if not greatly so and the327\nsystem is broadly sustainable. However, support under the EU single farm payment328\nscheme makes up a considerable proportion of the outputs (25% for wheat, for329\nexample), but applies to all levels of production. Recent increases in grain and oil330\nprices would have a major impact on the results and the need for subsidies. Fig 1b331\n15\nsuggests that, in operating at the optimum level for production, conventional wheat332\nproduction is also operating close to the optimal use of environmental resources.333\n334\n3.1.2. Oil seed rape (OSR)335\nThe TFP index for OSR is barely 1 at its maximum (Fig 1c), although it should be336\nnoted that the TFP index excluding environmental costs was greater than unity near337\nthe maximum yield of the crop (data not shown. The maximum in the TFP occurs338\nshort of the physiological optimum as expected and represents a saving of about \u00a340339\nha-1. The penalty from bringing extra land into production is irregular at low levels of340\nOSR production (Fig 1d). If OSR is to be grown, the application of a small amount of341\nfertiliser N increases saleable product greatly and so decreases the consumption of342\nland relative to a crop receiving no N disproportionately (Fig 1c). The optimum343\nproduction level is predicted to be close to the environmental optimum, but in this344\ncase somewhat less than current practice. There is, however, a demand for rape oil345\nfor biodiesel so this demand may have an increasingly positive effect on the TFP346\nindex.347\n348\n3.1.3. Maincrop potatoes349\n350\nThe form of the potato response to inputs (Fig 1e) is similar to that of wheat.351\nProduction costs are high relative to environmental costs, however, and it is352\nunderstandable why farmers do not judge it economic to reduce inputs even taking the353\ncost of the environmental burdens into account. Note, however, the much larger total354\ncost per hectare compared with the other two arable crops (Fig 1f). Apart from any355\nother factors, root crops always require more energy per hectare than combinable356\n16\ncrops, because deep ploughing is essential in cultivation and the soil must be worked357\nagain at harvest. With potatoes, the saving in moving back to the TFP maximum is358\nseveral hundred pounds: mostly in environmental costs. A large environmental359\nburden with this crop, however, is the GHG cost of storing tubers after harvest (Fig360\n1f).361\n362\n3.2. Meat finishing systems363\n364\nAnimal production systems are much more complicated to analyse than the three365\narable systems in Figure 1. For example, a beef production system involves the initial366\nproduction of calves, from either a dairy system or beef suckler system, each with its367\nown burdens from inputs such as, feeding and housing. These are affected by368\nfecundity, longevity, grassland management and feed conversion efficiency. The beef369\ncattle are fed on a combination of feeds, generally including grass, silage and a range370\nof concentrates (e.g. wheat, barley, wheatfeed oilseed meal and legumes). These all371\nhave their own inputs and burdens of production. There are also the associated372\noutputs, such as manure, wool and leather. However, we did not include the value of373\nthe latter two products. Housing of the animals, either intensively or extensively,374\ninvolves further inputs and burdens. There are many options for reducing inputs in375\nsuch a system, e.g. using different combinations of feed stuffs in the concentrate mix,376\nfeeding over a longer period, so that the daily live weight gain is reduced and it takes377\nlonger for the animal to reach maturity, or reducing the ratio of concentrates to378\ngrass\/silage. There are also opportunities for reducing inputs to the production of379\nfeedstuffs, principally nitrogen fertiliser, but which will then require a larger area of380\nland to grow the concentrates or grass. We have not looked at all the above inputs381\n17\nsimultaneously, but instead have decided to concentrate on N inputs to grassland382\n(NCYCLE, Scholefield et al., 1991), in the production of grass grazed by ruminants,383\nas an example of how inputs could be adjusted, and the resultant effects on384\nenvironmental burdens. The range of N inputs encompasses those recommended in385\nthe UK (MAFF, 2000). For reference, however, the amount of N applied to grassland386\nsystems grazed or fed to beef is usually of the order of 100 kg N ha-1 with a maximum387\nof about 250 kg N ha-1 in the UK (Defra, 2006). The meat production systems388\nanalysed here only deal with the finishing stage and do not include the breeding389\nphase, which generally uses lower inputs.390\n391\n3.2.1. Beef392\nWe selected and have analysed the system known as 18-month beef, which relies on393\nintensive grazing of fresh leys and good quality silage (see Nix, 2005, p 98). Some394\n30% of beef cattle are derived from calves from dairy herds and, of these, 45% are395\nestimated to be finished under this system (Williams et al., 2006). We have assumed396\nthat the calves are autumn born, are housed for two winters and fed on silage and397\nconcentrates. Costs associated with these feedstocks are included in the analysis. In398\nthe summer, cattle graze grass fertilized with manufactured N.399\n400\nBeef production profit expressed on a \u00a3 ha-1 basis continues to rise almost linearly401\nwith input (Figure 2a), but the TFP declines. The index is barely above 1, although402\nexcluding the environmental costs would raise the value of the index somewhat above403\none (data not shown). Figure 2b suggests that GHG emissions increase sharply with404\ninputs in this system, the largest components of which are the N2O emissions from405\ndenitrification of N fertiliser applied to the growing grass and feed, and the enteric406\n18\nfermentation to CH4 during the growth of the animals themselves. These are large at407\nall levels of production and increase with the intensity of production. Unlike arable408\nsystems, intensification in the stocking density does not lead to a reduction in the409\nburden of land-use. This is because the animals eat more food than can be produced410\non the land used to raise them. These \u2018external hectares\u2019 increase more than the411\namount that the land area housing the animals decreases. We assume a constant yield412\nfor silage and for concentrates and have not attempted to map a variation in intensity413\nof production in this part of the system onto the main beef production calculations.414\n415\n3.2.2. Sheep meat416\nProduction costs and values of output in the production of sheep meat are based on417\nNix (2005). In consultation with North Wyke Research (David Scholefield, personal418\ncommunication) we have treated sheep in a similar fashion to beef since both are419\nruminant systems, but the intensity of production of finishing lambs is somewhat less.420\nAs with beef production we concentrated on a particular system known as 'grass421\ngrazed finished store lambs', which are grazed for 3 months on lowland grass. See422\nsupplementary material for a more detailed description.423\n424\nThe TFP index declines with input in the production of lambs (Figure 2c) even though425\nprofitability continues to rise. However, the scale is small (right-hand y axis) and it is426\ndifficult to elicit a real response to changes in input in this already low-input system.427\nThe environmental costs of lamb production are the least of all the systems we428\nstudied.429\n430\n3.3 Production expressed on a per tonne basis431\n19\n432\nSo far we have expressed costs and returns on a per hectare basis and we have taken433\nthe physiologically optimum yield as the reference point for our analysis. When inputs434\nare reduced and yields are lower, we add the cost of using extra land to make up for435\nthe lost production. In this way, we have focused on the efficiency of systems that436\nmaintain current production rates.437\n438\nIf the breakdown in environmental costs is calculated on the basis of tonnes of439\nproduct (Figure 3) the results for the arable crops remain much the same as on a per440\nhectare basis. The minimum exploitation of the environmental resource occurs close441\nto high intensities of production. This is true of lamb production too, but it is442\ninteresting to note that there is a minimum in the environmental costs associated with443\ngrazed beef that did not show up clearly where the results were expressed on a per444\nhectare basis. In both animal systems, there is a trade-off between consumption of445\nland and the emission of GHGs (Figs 3d and e), but in the beef system GHG446\nemissions increase more and land consumption decreases less with intensity of447\nproduction than is the case with sheep production. In the arable systems, the emission448\nof GHGs and nutrient loss per tonne of product are reasonably constant across all449\nlevels of production, but pesticide pollution and land use increase at the lower levels450\nof production (Figs 3a, b and c). These results have been related to consistent but451\ndifferent measures of intensity on the x-axes of Figure 3. Both high and low intensity452\nproduction can give the same total cost (x-axes on Figures 1 and 2) when expressed453\non a per tonne basis, making the graphs difficult to read and interpret. Accordingly454\nwe have expressed intensity on the x-axis in non-monetary units.455\n456\n20\n4. Discussion457\n458\nThe relative contribution of the environmental burdens to agriculture, in financial459\nterms, is interesting and surprising. Our analysis suggests that land-use and GHG460\nemission are the most significant factors that determine system-wide sustainability461\n(i.e. TFP > 1.0). The total GHG emission from the manufacture of all chemical462\ninterventions and farm operations are greatest at the most intense rates of production,463\nand comprise the most significant environmental burden. Costs resulting from the464\nemission of N2O range from about \u00a310 to \u00a330 ha-1 moving from the least to the most465\nintensive cropping systems. In animal production the figures are about \u00a350 in lamb466\nproduction to more than \u00a3200 in beef. This is a significant part of the total GHG467\nemission from wheat, OSR and ruminant finishing systems, but the majority of the468\nGHG burden associated with potatoes is in the lifting and storage of the tubers. The469\nissues related to biocidal emissions do not change greatly with input, partly because470\nwe continue to apply insecticides and nematicides at the same rate per hectare to all471\nlevels of production. The loss of chemical inputs such as pesticides, is among the472\nlargest burdens at intermediate and high levels of production. At low levels of473\nproduction, land consumption is the greatest issue in winter wheat and OSR474\nproduction but land is less of an issue in finishing ruminants; for potatoes pesticide475\nuse and GHG production (chemical manufacture and harvesting and storage) are476\nbigger concerns. Above the physiological maximum of crop production, N and P477\nleaching and N2O emissions increase and leaching begins to become more serious,478\nparticularly for potatoes. Note that the increase in the consumption of land becomes479\nnegative at high levels of intensity (Figs 1b, d & f) because, despite the fact that the480\noptimum has been exceeded, production per unit area increases until maximum yield481\n21\nis achieved. The total environmental costs must reflect the fact that land is now482\nproducing slightly more per unit area in response to increased application of nitrogen.483\n484\n4.1. Availability of data, uncertainties and assumptions485\n486\nFor arable production, the availability of data was good, mainly because arable487\ncropping is a single-stage production system where the response to inputs is clear.488\nNutrient losses have been studied extensively during the last 15-20 years and,489\nalthough the data cannot represent the detail of production in all parts of the UK, they490\nnonetheless represent state of the art estimates at the national level. We have491\nreasonable confidence in the way we have tied measurements of loss during field-492\nbased production with the national estimates of pollution and burdens provided by493\nPretty et al. (2005b 2003, 2000) and others (Atkinson et al., 2004). There are,494\nhowever, differences in the values calculated by these authors for the environmental495\ncosts of different burdens, indicating differences of opinion as to the eventual future496\ncost of pollutants emitted now. In all systems, the mapping of national levels of the497\ncosts of removing pesticides from drinking water, or of the burden of these chemicals498\nto the environment, was difficult and must be considered highly uncertain. In general,499\nWilliams et al. (2006) suggest a variability of around 30% (CV) in national500\ninventories and surveys, rising to 70% in the case of N2O. Variability in farm inputs501\nwas thought to be <35%. The numbers we report are dependent on the assumptions502\nmade, usually to reflect average yields or a standard practice; inevitably there could503\nbe considerable variation about these averages and standards. These uncertainties will504\napply to the absolute value of the TFP index but we can have more confidence in the505\ntrends. Thus, while it may be difficult to pronounce this or that practice as sustainable506\n22\nin absolute terms, we believe that where we show significant changes in TFP with507\ninputs we have captured real trends.508\n509\n4.2 Environmental costs510\n511\nAt current values, it may seem surprising that the environmental costs are not a512\ngreater proportion of the whole. In part, this may be due to costs we have been unable513\nto evaluate, such as the subjective cost of landscape or of the cost to ecosystems off-514\nfarm. It is also true that there is considerable uncertainty attached to the estimates of515\nthe environmental costs. However, if these values or the costs attributable to farming516\nbecome available, our spreadsheets could be modified to take account of them. In517\nseveral systems, particularly arable farming, it is the increase in land area needed to518\nmatch national production levels that offsets any gain from reducing the intensity of519\nproduction. Our estimates of the ecosystem services provided by land are520\nconservative and derive from a 10-year old report that was itself conservative. Land521\nwould have to be valued at a much lower level before other environmental costs522\nbecome significant enough to push the maximum in the TFP to lower levels of523\nintensity of production. At much lower levels of production, economies of scale524\nmight decline and still more environmentally valuable land such as forest or natural525\necosystems might be needed.526\n527\n4.3 Multi-functionality528\n529\nEspinosa et al. (2008) and \u00d6zkaynak et al. (2004) strongly emphasise the context of530\nmeasures of sustainability. Our analysis is chiefly unimodal, although we have531\n23\nincluded the potential value of wheat straw (as bedding or biofuel, for example532\nPowlson et al., 2008). We do not consider whole-farm TFP here, although this clearly533\nwould have an impact on decision making at the enterprise scale. Analysis of534\nrotations is beyond the scope of this article but is clearly a topic worth further535\ninvestigation. Indeed the relatively low value of TFP in OSR suggests that this crop536\nmight be grown partly for its benefit as a break crop to a following wheat.537\n538\nLand can have more than one function and, if it is possible to promote a means to539\nrealise the value conferred on farm land by dealing with floods or providing a habitat540\nfor wildlife as well as growing a crop or finishing animals, then extensification might541\nseem a more valuable course of action. Some of these qualities were included in the542\nanalysis of ecosystem services carried out by Costanza et al. (1997) but these authors543\ndid not consider arable land suitable for water capture, storage or regulation.544\nIntercropping (either in space or time) might also raise the value of the sum of the545\noutputs, the diversity of species in the land as well as reducing pollution (Whitmore546\nand Schr\u00f6der, 2007). It is also possible for improvements in the state of the system to547\nhave more than one benefit. For example, increased levels of organic matter not only548\nincrease fertility (Whitmore and Schr\u00f6der, 1996) but also reduce the effort needed to549\nplough (Watts et al., 2006). Furthermore, the source of the extra carbon is the550\natmosphere thus reducing the potential for global warming.551\n552\n4.4 Temporality553\n554\nA systems level definition of sustainability is that we should leave opportunities to the555\nnext generation equal or greater in value to those we enjoy. We have not explicitly556\n24\nconsidered the change in TFP over time in this analysis and have kept the costs of557\nproducts and burdens static. To explore the dynamics of TFP as well as the effect of558\nthe rate of change of multiple inputs would have been unduly complex. The utility of559\nthe methodology presented here is its simplicity in the use of average values to560\ncapture the general balance between the competing components that determine561\nwhether or not a practice is sustainable. Clearly some information is lost in this way.562\nIn a theoretical analysis Cabezas and Fath (2002) elegantly express sustainability in563\nterms of Shannon entropy or Fisher information, I. A process is sustainable if I is564\nconstant. If I declines this indicates that the system is becoming less sustainable, if I565\nincreases this indicates self-organisation. To estimate I requires detailed knowledge566\nof the dynamics, which is beyond the scope of the relatively simple yet extensive567\nanalysis presented here.568\n569\nBalmford et al (2002) objected to Costanza\u2019s economic valuation of all that is in570\nplanet earth on the grounds that the demand curve is unlikely to be linear and so as571\nnature disappears, its value is likely to increase. Likewise the cost of food might572\nincrease disproportionately if it became scarce. In focussing on what will happen573\nwith fairly small shifts in production (\u00b120% say as here) our assumption of a574\nproportionate change cost is probably reasonable. It is clear, however, that strong575\npressures exist at the extremes and these will come into play if production is curbed or576\nintensified greatly. Barnett et al. (1994) illustrate this with reference to the long-term577\nexperiment on winter wheat on Broadbalk field at Rothamsted and at Woburn. The578\nindex illustrates the differences in sustainability in the early years of the 20th Century579\nand justifies the decision at that time to stop the experiment at Woburn while580\ncontinuing the one at Rothamsted. Business failure, however, is not always about one581\n25\nyear\u2019s bad results. Lien et al (2007) following Hansen et al. (1997) derive the relative582\nfrequency of profitable years in order to test the sustainability of farming in the face583\nof fluctuating conditions. In general, our analysis here has not attempted to take584\naccount of major changes or fluctuations in the cost or value of the components of our585\nTFP index. Most obviously, if food is scarce its cost will increase. Less obviously,586\nhowever, if land becomes damaged, production will fall, leading to a scarcity in food587\nor if prices vary widely, it becomes difficult to plan season-long activities such as588\nfarming.589\n590\n5. Conclusions591\n592\nThe intensity of the agricultural systems studied here that are optimal for production593\nappears to be close to that which is optimal for the environment too, provided no loss594\nof ecosystem service or productivity occurs in the land. Indeed wheat and OSR595\nappear to be close to the minimum environmental burden level in current UK systems.596\nIn contrast to arable farming, ruminant finishing systems are characterised by597\nincreasing environmental exploitation with intensity of production (mainly nitrogen598\nfertiliser use here) when expressed on a per hectare basis but there is a minimum in599\nthe environmental costs of all systems when expressed on per tonne basis. These600\nminima are close to the actual intensities of production adopted by farmers in the UK.601\n602\nAt the time of writing, all systems investigated relied on support mechanisms to make603\nthem economically viable; recent increases in the value of arable crops and steep604\nincreases in the cost of oil may have changed the relationship between economic and605\nenvironmental optima.606\n26\n607\nAttempting to manage any one or any of several environmental burdens such as GHG608\nemission without reference to all, especially land, is likely to lead to an increase in609\nexploitation of the unmanaged burden or to unintended results. Land area should be610\nincluded in any system of environmental management. Introducing environmental611\nincentives intended to reduce emissions without due reference to land, may have the612\nresult of pushing up land-use, land prices or both.613\n614\n615\n27\nAcknowledgements616\nRothamsted Research (RRes) is grant-aided by the UK Biology and Biotechnological617\nSciences Research Council.
