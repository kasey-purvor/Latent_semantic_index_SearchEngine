It is \nalso present in the Permian rocks of NE England and Northern Ireland (Fig. 1 and Notholt and \nHighley, 1973).  \n Where the saliferous Triassic rocks come to outcrop, most of the halite has dissolved and \nthe overlying and interbedded strata have collapsed or foundered producing a buried salt \nkarst. These areas commonly have saline springs, indicative of continuing salt dissolution and \n2 \nthe active nature of the karst processes. The salt deposits were exploited using these springs \nfrom before early Roman times to Victorian times when more intense brine and salt extraction \nwas undertaken. Halite dissolves rapidly and subsidence, both natural and mining-induced, \nhas affected the main Triassic salt fields including Cheshire, Staffordshire, Worcestershire, \ncoastal Lancashire and parts of Northern Ireland. Much of the mining has been by shallow \nbrine extraction, the results of which mimic the natural karstification of the salt deposits. \n Permian salt is present in The United Kingdom, at depth, beneath coastal Yorkshire and \nTeeside. Here the salt deposits and the karstification processes are much deeper than in the \nTriassic salt. The salt deposits are bounded up-dip by a dissolution front and collapse \nmonocline. Salt has also been won from these Permian rocks by dissolution mining and some \nhistorical subsidence due to mining has occurred along the banks of the River Tees.  \nSalt deposits in the UK  \nThe Triassic salt deposits in The United Kingdom were deposited in a semi-arid environment \nwithin mainly fault-controlled land-locked basins linked to the major depositional centres of \nthe North and Irish Seas. The general Triassic sequence comprises thick sandstones and \nconglomerates overlain by red-brown siltstone and mudstone with interbedded halite and \ngypsum sequences. The Permian salt deposits form part of the Zechstein Group sequence that \nextends eastwards from The United Kingdom to Holland and Germany. Only the featheredge \nof the Zechstein Group is present on shore in The United Kingdom and the salt deposits are \nrestricted to the coastal parts of northern England (Fig. 1). Here the Permian salt is \ninterbedded with thick dolomite, mudstone and anhydrite formations. \n \nFig. 1 The distribution of the salt karst and salt mining areas in England.  \nSalt karst in the UK  \nWhere the Triassic saliferous rocks come to outcrop, salt karst has developed (Fig. 1) at \ndepths of 30 to 130m. The development of this karst has been strongly influenced by \ngroundwater flow and the modification of the groundwater regime during the last, and \npossibly earlier, glaciations. The last (Devensian) glaciation buried the north and central parts \nof The United Kingdom beneath a thick wet-based ice-sheet producing elevated groundwater \nheads linked to the hydrology of the ice-sheet (Howell and Jenkins, 1976). This elevated head \nis thought to have depressed and flushed out the saline waters forcing the dissolution surface \nof the salt to cut deeper into the sequence. When the ice-sheet melted, the groundwater regime \nchanged and further dissolution of the salt occurred as new regional groundwater patterns \nformed. Because of the last glaciation, the depth of salt dissolution is commonly very deep. \nThis mechanism may also help to explain why the dissolution extends down to about 130m in \nthe Triassic salt of Cheshire, but to 3-400m in the Permian salt of northern England, where the \ncover of ice was probably much thicker. However, it must also be noted that the salt beds in \n3 \n4 \nthe Permian probably would not come to outcrop because their facies is restricted to the \ndeeper parts of the depositional basin (Smith, 1989). \n The way in which the salt karst has developed is also dependent on the nature of the \nlithological sequence in which the salt beds were deposited. In the Triassic deposits, most of \nthe salt is interbedded with units of siltstone and mudstone, commonly with gypsum. Where \nthe groundwater has circulated and removed the salt, only the interbedded insoluble rocks \nremain as a breccia, concealed by the commonly less brecciated, but foundered cover \nsequence. The traditional term for the salt surface where the dissolution has occurred is \u201cwet \nrock head\u201d because it is from here that the original brine extraction took place. In contrast, the \ntraditional name for the area where the salt has not dissolved because it is sealed beneath a \ncover of strata is \u201cdry rock head\u201d (Earp and Taylor, 1986; Evans and others, 1993 and Fig. 1). \nThe area of wet rock head encompasses the salt karst, but the depth of the karst surface \ngenerally lies some 30-130m below the ground surface and may even reach a depth of 180m \nin Cheshire (Howell, 1984). \n The wet rock head area is the zone in which dissolution has occurred and the foundered \nground above this zone commonly has numerous collapse features. These range from \nenclosed hollows 20-200m across to linear depressions up to several kilometres long. These \ndepressions were called \u201cbrine runs\u201d by the early brine miners and it was into these, and the \nbrine springs that they sunk their extraction wells.  \nHistorical records of salt springs \nPlace names that indicate salt springs \nHistorical maps and records of the salt areas record many brine spring locations revealed by \nthe place names. In Roman times, sources of salt were noted as Salinae. In Medieval times the \nlocations of salt springs were indicated by the term wich or wyche (Calvert, 1915; Room \n1988; Mills, 1998). Many of these places were later differentiated so that, for example, in \nCheshire, the towns of Nantwich, Middlewich and Northwich were established. Nantwich \nreferring to the named wich (Nametwilhc in 1194), Middlewich to the middle wich and \nNorthwich to the northernmost wich (Mills, 1988). Likewise in Droitwich the different \nsprings were individually named as Netherwich, Middlewich and Upwich corresponding to \ntheir places in the town and lower, middle and upper locations along the River Salwarpe \n(Woodiwiss, 1992, Fig. 120 ; Hurst, 1997, Fig. 2). The name of the river here probably \nindicates salt (possibly derived from the Roman name of Salinae) and a clay floodplain or \n5 \nwarpe, though Mills (1988) and Woodiwiss (1992) suggests the name probably only means \ndark coloured silty land. Many other places include wich or wyche at the start or end of their \nname and many of these are mentioned below. The current name for the administrative district \nwhich includes Droitwich is Wychaven (Room, 1988). \n1st \u201310th Century and earlier salt springs \nIt is documented that the natural brine springs at Northwich were exploited in pre-Roman \ntimes (Calvert 1915), but there is very little evidence remaining. At Droitwich, a possible Iron \nAge brine boiling hearth was excavated at the site of the Upwich brine spring (Hurst 1997) \nand probable remains of Iron Age salt pits were found elsewhere in the town (Woodiwiss, \n1992). In contrast, the Roman remains at Upwich were extensive and showed a well-\norganised salt industry. There was a wood-lined well and a probable brine lifting structure \n(Hurst 1997) that may have incorporated some sort of counterbalanced bucket mechanism. \nThe importance of Droitwich as a salt producer in Roman times is indicated by its Roman \nname of Salinae  a name also applied to Middlewich (Room, 1988) and used for Saltzburg in \nAustria. Droitwich has been recognised as the Salinae  noted in Claudius Ptolemy\u2019s \nGeography compiled in c. AD 140-150 and as the place named Salinis noted in the Ravenna \nCosmography compiled soon after AD 700 (Woodiwiss, 1992). The Roman names and \narchaeological evidence indicate that brine was flowing to the surface at Droitwich, \nMiddlewich and Northwich since before the start of written history. \nThe Early Medieval period or Dark Ages is poorly documented, but one of the earliest \nreferences to Droitwich salt was in 716 when King Ethelbald granted a salt pit on the south \nside of the River Salwarp to Evesham Abbey (Whitelock, 1954; Hoskins, 1955). Salouuarpe \n(Salwarpe) was also mentioned in 817 (Mills, 1998) and brine springs and salt furnaces were \nrecorded at Droitwich in 816 and 906 (Calvert, 1915). In 962, Bishop Oswald granted \nBeonetlaege (Bentley) four saltpans at Upwich (Droitwich) and enough woodland at \nBradanlaege (Bradley) to fuel them. Wychbold was mentioned in 692 (Mills, 1998) and \nSaltwic (Droitwich) in 884-901 (Woodiwiss, 1992).  \n11th \u2013 16th Century records of salt springs \nThe brine extraction and boiling industry established by the Romans flourished in Medieval \ntimes and was well documented in the Domesday Book. This was compiled for William 1st as \nan inventory of his newly acquired lands in 1084-1086 with numerous \u201cwiches\u201d and salt \nhouses recorded. (Calvert, 1915; Morris, 1978; Room, 1988; Hinde, 1985). Many places are \n6 \nnoted in the Domesday Book as having \u201csalt houses\u201d, but commonly they belonged to estates \noutside of the salt areas and many of the entries note \u201csalt houses at wich\u201d without stating \nexactly the wich to which they refer. Hoskins (1955) noted that at Droitwich King William \nhad eighty-five salt pans and sixty-eight manors and estates that had the rights to receive salt. \nSeveral dedicated roads or \u201csalt ways\u201d were established to transport the produce and some of \nthese may have dated back to Roman times. Places recorded in the Domesday Book and later \ndocuments that certainly had salt springs and salt pans include: Droitwich (Wich 1086, \nDrilhtwych 1347); Middlewich (Wich, Mildestuich, 1086); Nantwich (Wich 1086, \nNametwilhc, 1194); Northwich (Wich, Norwich, 1086); Salt (Selte 1086); Wychbold \n(Wicebold 1086); Salwarpe (Salewarpe, 1086) (Calvert, 1915; Room, 1988; Hinde, 1985). \nThe importance of Droitwich as a salt producer is shown by the fact that in 1215 King John \ngave Droitwich its charter in exchange for a yearly rental of \u00a3100 for the salt springs (Poole \nand Williams, 1980). \n17th \u201318th Century records of salt springs \nMost of the early records of salt springs relate to deeds, land ownership changes and taxes, \nbut in the 17th Century the scientific investigation of numerous natural, physical and chemical \nphenomena began. In 1669 William Jackson a \u201cDoctor of Physick\u201d reported details of the \nCheshire salt springs to the Royal Society. In 1678, Dr Thomas Rastell reported to the same \nsociety on the salt springs at Droitwich.  \nJackson\u2019s description of the Cheshire salt springs notes that the salt pits were 3-4 yards \ndeep (2.7-3.6m), though at Nantwich the spring was 7 yards (6.4m) from the surface. He \nnoted springs along the River Weever (now Weaver) at Hankilow (now Hankelow),  \nHatheton, Ofterson (probably Austerson), Bartherton (now Batherton), Nantwich, Weever \n(now Weaver), Leftwich, Northwich, and also at Midlewich (Middlewich) nearer the River \nDane than the Weaver. He noted that the salt was aggressive to vegetation and that the water \nin the brine pits was very cold. In addition he recorded that there were numerous mosses with \nturf that could be cut, dried in the sun (and presumably used for fuel). He recorded that:  \n\u201cthese Mosses seem to be places undermined by some Subterraneous streams; or by \nthe dissolution of some matter, that made them equal with the rest of the ground formerly: In \nwhich conjecture I am confirmed by this, That near a place of My Lord Cholmondeley\u2019s, \ncalled Bilkely, (now Bickley) about 9 or 10 years since, not far from one of these Mosses, \nwithout any Earth-quake, fell in a piece of ground about 30 yards over (more than 27.4m \nacross), with a huge noise, and great Oakes growing on it fell with it together; which hung \n7 \nfirst with part of their heads out, afterwards suddenly sunk down into the grounds so as to \nbecome invisible. Out of which Pitt they drew Brine with a pitcher tyed to a cart rope, but \ncould then find no bottom with the ropes they had there: Since, the Pitt is filled up with water, \nand now doth not taste Salt, but a very little brackish, a very small rindlet (stream?) passing \nthrough it. The nearest salt springs to it are at Dartwich about 3 miles from it, belonging to \nthe present Lord Keeper, and My Lord Cholmondeley\u201d (Jackson, 1669; Dartwich is not \nshown on any of 1880 maps or later maps for the area).   \nAnother record of this subsidence is presented by Ormerod (1848) who noted that the \nevent took place on 8th July 1659 at the place called Barrel-fall, and that it was now dry and \novergrown with brush wood. As part of his scientific work, Jackson (1669) recorded and \nmeasured the concentration of salt in the brine noting the strongest spring at Midlewich \n(Middlewich) yielded one fourth part of salt, but had a low flow. In contrast that at Nantwich \nyielded one sixth part and had a large yield. He found that the strength of the brine was \nstronger when the pit had been left to rest and not exploited for some time. \nRastell described the salt springs of Droitwich in 1678 noting that: \u201cThere are many \nSalt Springs about the town, which is seated by a Brook-side called Salwarp-Brook, which \narise both in the Brook and in the ground near it, though there are but three Pits that are \nmade use of.\u201d He recorded the Upwich Pit as 30 feet (9m) deep and 10 feet square (3m) with \nthree springs rising in the bottom of the excavation into ground that was originally a bog. He \nnoted the brine was very cold and that the strength of the brine changed as the pits were \nexploited. The strongest brine at Upwich yielded about one quarter its weight in salt. The \nproduction of crystallised salt for each day was given as 450 bushels from Upwich, 40 bushels \nfrom best pit at Netherwich and 30 bushels from the worst pit. A bushel has a volume of 8 \nimperial gallons (36.4 litres), which using a dry density of 1.154 for loose salt crystals (Salt \nInstitute web page figure http:\/\/www.saltinstitute.org\/15.html ) would equate to about 42kg of \nsalt in a bushel and a daily salt abstraction at Droitwich of about 21,840kg. Using a specific \ngravity of 2.165 for solid crystalline salt, this would equate with about 10 cubic metres of \nrock salt a day dissolving naturally in the surrounding area to feed the springs. The actual \nfigure may have been more since much of the brine may have leaked naturally into the river \nthrough Quaternary river gravel deposits. \nThe near natural flow of the springs at Droitwich was dramatically changed in 1725 \nwhen gypsum beds confining the brine beneath the springs were penetrated and greater \nvolumes of brine were produced. Parkinson (1884), quoting a Dr Nash, commented that at \none time nine tenths of the brine flow ran to waste. He also recorded that in 1779 Richard \n8 \nNorris sank a well through the red marl and gypsum, striking a brine spring at a depth of 80 \nfeet (26m) from the surface. The brine rushed upwards with such force that one or two \nworkmen were killed. When such deep and extensive exploitation of the brine began the \nnature of the salt karst started to change dramatically.  \nThe influence of salt mining and brine extraction \nSalt mining and brine extraction have played a major role in the modern development of the \nsalt karst in the Cheshire and Worcestershire areas. The original method of getting the salt \nwas to tap into the natural brine springs, a technique that satisfied the Roman and Medievel \nsalt industries. In the 16th to 18th Centuries the demand for salt became much greater and wells \nwere sunk on the sites of the brine springs to tap into the deeper more concentrated and more \nreliably available brine. From the late 16th Century reciprocating pumps were developed to \ndraw up the brine (Woodiwiss, 1992). \n From the 18th Century onwards, boreholes with pumps were developed and the extraction \nof even deeper brine became possible. The technique was to tap into the natural underground \nbrine runs that mainly existed at the interface of the rocksalt and the overlying deposits and \ncollapsed materials. This method of uncontrolled brine extraction was referred to as \u201cwild\u201d \nbrining. The method induced brine to flow towards the extraction boreholes aggravating the \nexisting subsidence features or causing linear subsidence belts spreading along strike from the \nboreholes. It was this uncontrolled way to abstract brine that caused the enlargement of the \nnatural brine runs and resulted in widespread subsidence for considerable distances from the \nextraction points. The large-scale abstraction of brine in this way enhanced the development \nof the natural salt karst into an unnatural form.  \n In the late 19th and early 20th Centuries the salt deposits were worked mainly by two \nmethods: conventional mining and wild brine solution mining. Most of the conventional \nmining was in shallow \u201cpillar and stall\u201d mines with networks of tunnels commonly separated \nby narrow salt pillars. In many places the salt was also worked by pillar and stall mining \nbased on very large extraction rates and very small pillars for support. Many of these mines \nwere fairly near to the wet rock head areas and flooding was a common hazard. Not wishing \nto waste valuable salt, many of the flooded salt mines were also pumped for brine, a technique \nreferred to as \u201cbastard\u201d brining. This produced catastrophic mine collapse inducing surface \nsubsidence on such an enormous and unprecedented scale that it destroyed whole areas of \ntowns and factories. Around Northwich and Middlewich, the resulting subsidence was \ncatastrophic and widespread. New lakes, locally called \u201cmeres\u201d or \u201cflashes\u201d, appeared almost \ndaily and many were hundreds of metres across including Moston Flash near Elworth (Earp \nand Taylor, 1986; Waltham, 1989; Waltham and others, 1997).  \n The subsidence in Cheshire was so severe that a Parliamentary investigation of the \nproblems was commissioned (Dickinson, 1873). Subsequently, an Act of Parliament was \npassed that placed a levy on all locally extracted salt. This levy, which funded building \nreconstruction and compensation payments, is still made by the \u201cCheshire Brine Subsidence \nCompensation Board\u201d, but at a lower rate to reflect the reduced risk from modern extraction \n(Collins, 1971). Both the brining and the mining caused major perturbations to the salt karst \nsystem and the brine flows related to it. \n Modern salt extraction is carried out in three ways. There is one relatively small licensed \nproducer extracting wild brine from relatively shallow boreholes sunk into the wet rock head. \nHowever, most modern salt extraction takes place either in deep, dry, pillar and stall mines at \ndepths of 125-170m, or by controlled brine extraction, at depths of 150-300m, leaving large, \ndeep underground chambers that are left flooded and filled with saturated brine. The \nexpectation is that these brine cavities and mines will remain stable and some are used for \nwaste disposal (Northolt and Highley, 1973). \n \n \nFig. 2. Cross-section through a typical Triassic salt area showing the dissolution zone, the dissolution mining and \nthe present mining situation. \nThe Salt karst areas of the United Kingdom \nCheshire \nTwo salt formations are present in the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group in Cheshire. These \nare the Wilkesley Halite Formation (up to 300m thick) near the top and the Northwich Halite \n9 \n10 \nFormation (up to 200m thick, with mudstone partings) in the middle of the group (Earp and \nTaylor, 1986; Evans and others, 1993, Wilson, 1993). The sequence between and below the \nsalt formations is dominantly red-brown gypsiferous and dolomitic mudstone and siltstone. \nThe salt karst has developed below the collapsed and foundered strata over wet rock head. \nBrine escaping from this dissolution zone formerly emerged at the surface as brine springs, \nbut subsequent brine extraction caused most of them to cease flowing. In Cheshire, brine \nsprings occurred in many places including Northwich, Middlewich, Nantwich, Winsford. \nThey were also present near Whitchurch (Shropshire) at Higher Wych and a place formerly \ncalled Dirtwich. Natural subsidence has occurred sporadically throughout the salt field, one of \nthe earliest records being in 1533 at Combermere Abbey near Whitchurch (Sherlock, 1921). \nAnother was recorded at Bilkely in about 1659 near Cholmondeley Castle (Jackson, 1669; \nOrmerod, 1848). Numerous buildings at Wybunbury near Crewe were damaged by salt \ndissolution subsidence in the late 19th Century and the cause may have been natural since the \nnearest brine extraction was over 10 miles away (De Rance, 1891). Many natural lakes such \nas Rostherne Mere near Knutsford were also formed by salt dissolution since the end of the \nDevensian ice-age and the Cheshire saltfield is dotted with meres formed in this way \n(Waltham and others, 1997). \n The Cheshire saltfield has a long history of exploitation growing from its first pre-Roman \ndevelopment around the salt springs into a major industry. Some details of the mining and \ndamage caused are mentioned above in the historical and mining sections. The uncontrolled \nextraction of brine resulted in an artificial lowering of the brine\/freshwater interface. This \nallied with groundwater abstraction from adjacent aquifers has disturbed the brine above the \nkarst surface and introduced fresh water into some areas (Howell and Jenkins, 1976). \nHowever, recent geochemical sampling (British Geological Survey, 1999) has shown that \nbrine from springs is entering the rivers in the Cheshire saltfield again. From river flow \nvolumes, and the content of salt in the water it should be possible to calculate the amount of \nsalt being removed annually from the Cheshire saltfield. However, not all the salt in the rivers \nis from the salt beds, since much of the British river chloride solute load is derived from the \nBritish maritime precipitation (Walling and Webb, 1981) and anthropogenic sources such as \nroad de-icing and sewage works (British Geological Survey, 1999).  \nStaffordshire \nThe salt deposits under the town of Stafford lie in a synclinal structure faulted along its \neastern side (Arup Geotechnics, 1990). The salt occurs interbedded with mudstone in a \n11 \nsequence 50-65m thick within the Mercia Mudstone Group. The near-surface deposits have \ndissolved to a depth of around 50m (wet rock head) and the salt has largely dissolved adjacent \nto the eastern fault zone. The natural salt springs around Stafford are not well documented, \nbut the town is surrounded by the villages with names ending in wich; these include Baswich, \nMilwich, Gratwich, Colwich and Shirleywich (along with the village of Salt), all suggesting \nthe presence of brine springs. The springs at Shirleywich have a long history of exploitation \nfrom the 17th century to the late 18th century. The Shirleywich springs, and nearby ones at \nWeston, appear to be fed from salt deposits lying to the north-east in a belt running through \nChartley Moss and other small lakes. Lying 5km to the NE of Shirleywich, Chartley had the \nstrongest saline springs in Staffordshire in the mid 16th century (Sherlock, 1921). Chartley \nMoss is a fresh-water pond and floating bog formed in a salt dissolution subsidence area. \nLocalised collapse here causes minor seismic events that are felt on the surface of the bog, \nthus providing evidence of active salt dissolution and subsidence beneath the site (A. \nBrandon, pers comm. 2000). Brine was extracted from beneath the town of Stafford from \nabout 1890 until a court case in 1970, over substantial subsidence damage, caused the \ncessation of wild brine extraction from the area. Only something like 10% of the volume of \nsalt removed by this brine extraction has been accounted for by recorded subsidence and \nfurther subsidence may occur in the area. The main brine run trends NNE towards the \nextraction boreholes and about 2 square kilometres of land have been affected by subsidence. \nSince the 1940\u2019s about 20 properties have been demolished and 500 severely damaged (Arup \nGeotechnics, 1990).  \nLancashire \nThe Lancashire coast beneath Blackpool and Preesall is underlain by the Triassic  Mercia \nMudstone Group which includes several salt units. Two impersistent units, the Rossal Halite \nand the Mythop Halite, occur low in the sequence and a third more persistent unit, the Preesall \nHalite occurs high in the sequence (Wilson, 1990; Wilson and Evans, 1990). The Preesall \nHalite was formerly worked in salt mines at Preesall on the east side of the River Wyre.  The \neast of the saltfield is marked by the Preesall Fault Zone. Adjacent to this the westerly dipping \nsalt comes near to crop, but groundwater circulation has dissolved the salt to a depth of \nbetween 50 and 100m resulting in a collapse breccia down to wet rock head (Wilson and \nEvans, 1990). Though there are no confirmed saline springs in the area, their most likely \nposition would be at the coast emerging beneath the sea. Sherlock (1921) notes the name of \nthe village of Salwick near Kirkham just south of the district (however, because the coast is \n12 \nnearby, this name could equally relate to the production of sea salt). Probable subsidence \nareas, in which post-glacial peat deposits have formed, are also recorded in the district, \nespecially around Mythop (Wilson and Evans, 1990). These subsidence areas range from 30 \nto 150m across and contain up to 10m of peat formed over the last 12,000 years. They give an \nindication of the amount and rate of salt karstification that has taken place beneath the area. \nWorcestershire  \nThe Triassic saliferous rocks in Worcestershire occur in the Mercia Mudstone Group and \ninclude the upper and a middle sequences of salt beds approximately equivalent to the \nCheshire salt beds further north. The saliferous sequence is about 90m thick of which 40% \ncomprise siltstone and mudstone units. In Roman times, the town of Droitwich was called \nSalinae, a name indicative of the brine springs that rose there in the valley of the River \nSalwarpe. The three main springs of Netherwich, Middlewich and Upwich were noted by \nRastell 1678 and some of their excavations described by Woodiwiss (1992) and Hurst (1997). \nIn the 17th century shafts were sunk that increased the brine flow from the Droitwich springs. \nIn the 18th century deeper pits encountered artesian brine that could not be controlled and \nlargely ran to waste (Poole and Williams, 1981). Some salt mining was undertaken in the \ndistrict, but it encountered natural brine runs and the subsequent exploitation was by brine \nextraction that ceased in 1972. The brine abstraction caused the natural brine springs at the \nsurface to dry up. It also caused a belt of subsidence along, and spreading out from, the course \nof the original sinuous brine run. The brine run follows the wet rock head of the strata which \ndips to the south-east and it has a north-east trending course through Droitwich and Wychbold \nto the former salt works at Stoke Prior. This is near the ancient Upton Warren pools dating \nfrom about 42,000 years BP, preserved in alluvial deposits and inferred to have formed in \nbrackish water conditions (Coope and others, 1961). Where the salt has dissolved, the zone of \ncollapse over the wet rock head extends down to a depth of about 90m forming a belt 1-2km \nwide and 12km long. The route of the original brine run was the area in which the most \nsubsidence and building damage occurred in the 19th century. In the 1980\u2019s after the cessation \nof brine extraction, the brine levels began to rise. This caused Poole and Williams (1981) to \nspeculate that in the future brine would flow again from the sites of the original springs that \nwere used by the Romans. The fact that brine now flows naturally to the surface here is \nproved by a recent geochemical survey (British Geological Survey, 1999) which showed \nstream water Chloride concentrations of 3100 and 3400 mg\/l on adjacent sites to the east of \nDroitwich.  \n13 \nNorthern Ireland \nTriassic saliferous rocks are present in the area around Carrickfergus and Larne, bordering on \nBelfast Loch in Northern Ireland. The Triassic sequence includes up to 200m thickness of \nsalt, proved in the Larne Borehole, but in the Carrickfergus salt field only about 40-50m has \nbeen proved. The salt deposits are largely protected from groundwater circulation by the \noverlying sequence and there is no record of wet rock head and extensive brecciation such as \nthat found in Cheshire (Griffith and Wilson, 1982). A salt spring was known at Eden, where \nsalt mining subsequently developed, and slight brecciation of the sequence was recorded in a \nfew boreholes, but was not extensive. The most spectacular dissolution feature recorded in the \narea was the collapse of the Tennant Salt Mine in 1990 (Griffith, 1991). This mine was a \nconventional pillar and stall mine, but subsequent owners removed substantial amounts of \nbrine from the abandoned workings. This dissolved the pillars and produced a large crown \nhole with concentric failure planes and a depression about 130m across.  \nTeeside and Yorkshire \nIn the north of England, salt is present in the Permian strata of the Zechstein Group. This \nevaporite and carbonate sequence extends from northern England eastwards beneath the North \nSea to Germany and beyond. Only the marginal part of the Zechstein basin encroaches \nonshore in England where it includes thick units of anhydrite, halite and potash. The salt and \npotash deposits are currently mined by pillar and stall workings near the coast at Whitby. \nHere they are up to about 80m thick and occur at depths of 1100-1250 metres (Woods, 1973). \nThe halite was also been extracted by dissolution at Teeside in the early 20th Century (Tomlin, \n1982) and its presence was largely responsible for the development of the chemical industry \nin the area. Anhydrite was also formerly mined here at Billingham (Raymond, 1960). The salt \nkarst features on Teeside are very deep-seated and may be palaeokarst or, as discussed earlier, \nmay relate to deep dissolution during the last ice-age. At the coast the salt is present at a depth \nof about 500m. Westwards up-dip there is a dissolution front in the salt (British Geological \nSurvey 1987) and the overlying strata have collapsed and formed into a west-facing \nsubsidence monocline (Fig. 3). Coming further up-dip the anhydrite units in the sequence pass \ninto gypsum at depths of between 120 and 60m and this too passes into another dissolution \nfront with an associated subsidence monocline (Fig. 3 and Cooper, 1998). Though salt \nextraction by dissolution has largely ceased on Teeside, but some subsidence has occurred \nand may occur in the future.  \n \n \nFig. 3. Simplified cross-section through the dissolution fronts of the Permian salt and gypsum\/anhydrite in north-\neast England. In reality, there are several sequences of anhydrite and salt that can each produce their own \nmonoclinal structures. \nPlanning for soluble rock geohazards \nCurrent planning procedures ensure that the modern exploitation of salt deposits lies largely \noutside of urban areas so that risks are considerably reduced. Furthermore, except for one \nnatural brine extractor, the majority of the salt is mined either in deep dry mines, or by \ncontrolled brine extraction from depth. However, there is still a legacy of problems related to \nthe salt deposits. These include old salt mines that have not collapsed, and compressible or \nunstable collapsed ground over former salt mines. In addition, natural salt dissolution at the \nrockhead interface, between the salt deposits and the overlying superficial deposits, can cause \nground engineering problems and corrosive saline groundwater. With the ending of most \nnear-surface mining and brine extraction, the hydrological system has, or is in the process of, \nre-balancing itself. It may be expected that natural groundwater flows will be re-established \nthrough the disrupted saltfields and further subsidence problems may occur. The accurate \nmapping of the rock salt and associated deposits, plus an understanding of their dissolution \nand collapse characteristics, can help development and planning in these subsidence-sensitive \nareas. These problems can then be reduced by careful planning and construction or \nremediation of former mines. In some places, such as Teeside, the local planning guidelines \nfor development in former salt dissolution extraction areas (Morris, 1975) place a zone, that is \nconsidered to be susceptible to subsidence, of between 150m and 300m radius around every \nformer brine extraction borehole in the area. The size of this buffer zone appears to relate to \nthe depth and amount of salt extracted from each hole. In these areas, it is recommended that \navoidance or special precautions should be taken for certain types of construction. In Cheshire \ncollapse of some former mines are causing subsidence and their remediation is being \nconsidered. In most of the salt karst areas, there is a legacy of difficult ground conditions \nproduced by natural and man-made causes. \n14 \n15 \n  \nAcknowledgements.  \nThis paper has benefited from useful discussions with Dr Tony Waltham, Professor Martin \nCulshaw and Dr John Lamont-Black.
