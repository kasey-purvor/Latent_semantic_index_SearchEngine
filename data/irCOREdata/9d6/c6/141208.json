Introduction \n1.1. Background \nThe emission of odour from landfill sites and industrial processes is a recurrent problem for \noperators and regulators, who have to deal with complaints from the public.  Population \ngrowth and housing needs have resulted in increasing numbers living within close proximity \nto these odour sources.  In the UK, 80% of the population live within 2km of either a closed \nor active landfill site (Elliott et al, 2001) and therefore, the potential for exposure to odours is \nhigh.  Odour at landfill sites is primarily caused by the anaerobic decomposition of \nbiodegradable waste.  The exact nature of odour emissions is therefore dependent on waste \ncharacteristics, such as composition and age. \n \nGostelow et al (2004) describe the sequence of events leading to odour annoyance as: \nformation of the odour at source; emission from source; transport to receptor; and perception \nby receptor, who then makes a judgement as to whether the odour causes an annoyance or \nnot.   \n \nTransport of the odour is affected by factors such as the season, time of day and the \natmospheric conditions influencing dispersion of the odour (e.g. turbulence, wind speed and \nwind direction).  Detectability and annoyance potential will influence the response by \nreceptors.  Perception of odour may therefore be affected by the combination of odorous \ncompounds released during formation (Sarkar et al, 2003a), as well as the characteristics of \nthe odour itself, such as duration and frequency of emission. \n \nOdour intensity and hedonic (the pleasantness or unpleasantness of the odour) properties \nexperienced by the population may be interpreted as strong or offensive, respectively, in \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 4\nplace of faint or not-unpleasant.  Miedema et al (2000) show that the hedonic tone or \npleasantness of the odour has an affect on the annoyance people feel.  Both et al (2004) \ndemonstrate how hedonic tone has a clear impact on the annoyance felt by receptors at low \nconcentrations, with pleasant odours having significantly lower annoyance potential than \nneutral or unpleasant odours.  The hedonic tone of unpleasant odours at higher concentrations \ndoes not affect the annoyance potential of these odours, and Both et al (2004) show that \nodour frequency is sufficient to predict odour annoyance from unpleasant odours. \n \nFactors including personal health, social status and previous exposure to odours may all \ninfluence how a person perceives an odour (Cavalini et al, 1991; Winneke and Neuf, 1992).  \nA person\u2019s response to odour can further be influenced by the context of exposure, such as \nthe presence of other odours and the reactions of people around them.  Some members of the \npopulation are more predisposed to complain, while others may adopt alternative coping \nstrategies.  If the odour is perceived to be associated with a potential health risk, the \nprobability of concern and increased annoyance is higher (Dalton, 2003). \n \nThe primary concern during monitoring and measuring odours is determining the threshold at \nwhich an odour becomes a nuisance.  Two terms used to define the response of the public to \nodour emissions are annoyance and nuisance.  Annoyance is defined by Lindvall and Radford \n(1973) as the negative response associated with exposure to an agent or event that is believed \nto cause harm to the individual, and thus requires a coping strategy.  A nuisance is commonly \ndefined in law as the threshold at which a population experiences annoyance (van Harreveld, \n2001), from repeated incidents of exposure.  These may be translated into law as a statutory \nlimit. \n \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 5\n1.2. Odour regulation \nThe difficulty in predicting perception and response to odour at different concentrations is \nproblematic for the definition of emission limits with which to regulate industries causing \nodour.  Two metrics are commonly used to define annoyance, the sensory metric of odour \nconcentration or \u2018dose\u2019 to which a receptor is predicted to be exposed, and the time or \nduration of exposure (Clarkson, 2000). \n \nMahin et al (2000) reviews standards for various USA state authorities, as well as European \nand Pacific Rim countries.  Their review shows wide variations as to what is considered \nacceptable across these authorities.  The pattern that emerges from studying odour regulations \nacross the world (Table 1) is that less densely populated countries, such as Australia and the \nUSA, have more stringent regulations than more densely population countries.  The logic \nbehind such stringent regulations is that if there is no odour, there will be no complaints and \ntherefore no problem (Schulz and van Harreveld, 1996).  However, stringent limits such as \nthese can result in high remedial costs to the process operators.  Most European countries \nseek to regulate less stringently by providing quantitative limits aimed at reducing annoyance \nto an acceptable level at an acceptable cost. \n \nNo regulations are imposed by the European Union with respect to odours, except for a \nstandard for the measurement of odours, developed by the European standardisation \ncommittee (CEN, 1995; 2003), and a draft standard exists sewage treatment works (Table 1).  \nIndividual countries within Europe have made significant advances in the regulation of \nodours, particularly the Netherlands (see Table 1) and Germany.  German government \nGuidelines on odour in ambient air (GOAA, 1999) set out requirements for monitoring \nodours and maximum emission limits in terms of odour hours.  In practice, the concentration \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 6\nfluctuations may be estimated by simply scaling the hourly mean by a factor of ten \n(Christensen et al, 1996).  The preferred method for assessment of initial odour impacts is the \nsampling regime described in the guidelines.  Any additional odour impacts may be assessed \nusing dispersion modelling. \n \nWithin the UK, odour from existing facilities is primarily controlled by the Environmental \nProtection Act of 1990.  The current de facto level for preventing odour complaints is set at \nbelow 5 ou m-3 for 98% of the year, based on research in The Netherlands (Clarkson, 2000).  \nThe water industry has also proposed a two tier system for new and existing wastewater \ntreatment plants (UKWIR, 2004) \n \n1.3. Odour assessment \nOdour emissions are episodic, characterised by periods of high emission rates, interspersed \nwith periods of low emissions.  The human olfactory sense responds within seconds to a \nstimulus.  Odours therefore create a response in the receptor quicker than most other \natmospheric pollutants (Irish Environmental Protection Agency, 2001).  Greater annoyance is \ncaused by more short periods of odour than by longer lasting odour emissions, as the \nolfactory sense is able to adapt to persistent odours, thereby reducing annoyance (GOAA, \n1999).  However, the short term, high peak concentrations may still be detected and \nconsidered an annoyance (Miedema et al, 2000).  In other words, it is frequently the \nfluctuations from the mean concentration, and not the actual mean itself, that determine how \nthe odour is perceived (Best et al, 2001).  However, odour regulations are currently expressed \nas hourly average concentrations. \n \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 7\nDispersion modelling has frequently been used to assess the potential dispersion of odour \nfrom industrial sources (Sheridan et al, 2004).  Two approaches to modelling odour nuisance \nfor regulation can be adopted.  The first option aims to model the \u201creal life\u201d situation and is \nan attempt to model and understand the odour concentrations that may cause annoyance, or in \nother words, the concentration average over a certain time period, usually one hour.  This is \nthe approach often used by regulators and is acceptable as long as exposure is not under-\nestimated and a \u201ctolerable level\u201d is defined.   \n \nThe use of concentrations averaged over such periods effectively filters out peak and short \nterm fluctuations, resulting in conservative results with respect to maximum concentration \nlevels (Sarkar et al, 2003b).  While a single peak may not result in annoyance, repeated high \npeaks at times of high exposure could be missed by using averages.  Simms et al (2000) \nconsidered it unlikely that an odour will be a nuisance until it is detectable for longer periods \nof time, typically longer than three minutes. \n \nThe second modelling approach involves the use of short averaging times.  In this way, it is \npossible to capture concentration peaks, and thereby obtain a more accurate prediction of \nodour dispersion.  New generation air dispersion models can be run at averaging times of less \nthan an hour, although they are typically not used for short interval averaging times by \nregulators.  Furthermore, the most frequently available atmospheric input data for these \ndispersion models are hourly averaged variables.   \n \nAny model will require simplifying assumptions to be made and will have built-in \nuncertainties, uncertainty being a measure of the reliability that can be associated with the \nresults of a model (Yegnan et al, 2002).  In particular, uncertainties associated with source \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 8\nterm measurements, for example, instrument failure or incomplete data recording, will be \ncarried over into modelling studies.  If the magnitudes of measured results are considered as a \nGaussian distribution, the \u201ctails\u201d of the distribution, representing relatively low sample \nnumbers, are associated with a higher margin of statistical error (Ballesta, 2005; Irish \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 2001).  Furthermore, odours are commonly the results of a \nrelease of several odorous compounds, but they are generally modelled as a single indicator \ncompound, usually with a low odour threshold and a high emission rate.  Taken with the \nregulatory approach of modelling the hourly average concentration, this can mean that total \nodour concentration peaks could be seriously underestimated, resulting in annoyance and \ncomplaints.   \n \nThe exploration and quantification of uncertainties aids in defining sampling methods in \nfuture studies, and in refining and validating model options.  It is therefore vital for the model \nto be tested and validated, not to eliminate the uncertainties, but to understand and quantify \nthem. \n \n1.4. Study rationale \nOdour concentration measurements within a laboratory alone, using olfactometry, or \ninstrumental analysis, fail to capture the properties of the odour as perceived by a community \nas it does not capture the other characteristics of the odour such as hedonic tone, which \ninfluence the way the odour is perceived by the public.  Hedonic tone assessments can also be \ncarried out in the laboratory.  Sarkar et al (2003b) analysed the link between odour dispersion \nand the perception of odour from a landfill site, using data from a monitoring programme \nwithin a community.  The response of the community was found to vary greatly.   \n \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 9\nOdour emissions are episodic, and it is the infrequent, high concentration peaks that cause \nannoyance.  Dispersion modelling is accepted as a useful tool for odour impact assessment \nand guidance exists for odour dispersion modelling (e.g. Environment Agency, 2002).  \nHowever, little attention has been paid to the appropriate definition of averaging time when \nattempting to understand off-site amenity impacts \n \nThis study attempts to assess the appropriateness of using different averaging times to model \nthe dispersion of odour from a landfill site.  These results will be compared with a \ncommunity monitoring programme database.  We aim to examine the perception of the odour \nin the community in conjunction with the modelled odour dispersal.   \n \n2. Material and methods \nThe landfill site studied, located in Bedfordshire, is licensed to receive up to 600 waste \nvehicles a day, although it usually accepts about half that number.  These vehicles contain \ncommercial, household and industrial waste.  This site has been studied for approximately 10 \nyears by researchers at Cranfield University. \n \n2.1. Community monitoring \nIn order to determine if annoyance was being caused by the landfill site, two indications of \nodour annoyance were used: \ni. Complaints to the operators from all members of the community; \nii. Daily monitoring records made by selected members of the local community. \nSite inspections carried out by the Community Liaison Officer from the company are used to \nunderstand the causes of incidents and assess the control the operator has over these \nincidents. \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 10\n \nComplaints to the landfill operators can be made through a number of routes, either directly \nto the site, to the operator\u2019s Community Liaison Officer, to the local authority (County \nCouncil), to Environmental Health Officers (EHOs), or to the Environment Agency, which \nincorporates the previous Waste Regulation Authority.  Each of these parties ensure that the \noperator and local authority are informed of the complaint.  The details of the complaints \ninclude the location, name (where given) of complainant, number of people complaining, the \nnature of the problem, the time the odour occurred, the time of reporting, result of the \ninvestigation as to the cause, and the weather conditions recorded from the automatic weather \nstation on-site.  The most common recorded complaints are from the following sources: \ni. Landfill gas emissions caused by methanogenesis taking place within the landfill cell. \nii. The construction of liquid waste disposal trenches, which expose existing waste \ndeposits prior to appropriate covering. \niii. Refuse recently delivered to the landfill site and not yet placed within the cell \nstructure. \niv. Odours arising from certain types of waste (e.g. chemical treatment waste or \nmalodorous waste) as it is delivered. \n \nIn addition to the complaints data, a system of odour monitoring by selected members of the \nsurrounding community has been established since 1994.  These daily reports record all \nodour types, coded into four categories: Local odours (e.g. bonfires), landfill odours, odour \nfrom a neighbouring brick-works and agricultural odours.  Community monitors have all \nvolunteered to take part in the study and are anonymous to the landfill operators.  In addition \nto their monitoring role are encouraged to report complaints to the operators as any other \nmember of the community would normally do. \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 11\n \nThe number of monitors has varied throughout the period of the study, from 13 to 25, with 43 \nindividuals contributing since 1994.  An average of 17 monitors have recorded odours within \nthe area during the ten years of the study.  Each person monitoring is given guidance in the \nprocedures and tested for specific anosmia (lack of sensitivity) to the mercaptan family of \nodours.  This data is of help in interpreting the significance of the complaint data.  In addition \nto describing the odour, monitors are asked to quantify the scale and offensiveness of the \nodour, the time of monitoring, and general weather conditions.  The monitors are trained to \nassess the likely cause of the odour and record the certainty of the assessments as part of the \nprocess.  By comparing the timing and location of complaints with the recorded incidents, an \nindication as to the extent to which complaints reflect the recorded experience of landfill \nodours can be found.  In addition, the monitoring and complaints data provide real life \nevidence of where odour occurs and where annoyance results. \n \n2.2. Dispersion modelling \n2.2.1. Odour sampling \nOdour samples were taken from three locations within the landfill site on a single afternoon \nin July 1998 (UK summer), representing the active cell, the operational area and freshly \ntipped waste.  The sampling location within each of these areas was chosen at random.  \nSamples were collected using a Lindvall hood for waste surfaces at approximately every 10 \nminutes between 14:00 and 16:00 (Gostelow et al., 2003).  Samples were collected using the \n\u201clung principle\u201d, where the sampling bag (Nalophan-NA) is placed in a rigid container under \npressure, which causes the bag to fill with a volume of sample equal to that which has been \nremoved from the container using a vacumn pump.  Two samples were taken from each area.  \nThe samples were assessed (within 30 hours) using dynamic dilution olfactometry, at the \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J.

An \u201cOlfaktomat\u201d dynamic dilution olfactometer (Project Research, \nAmsterdam) was used with a panel of four or more members.  The panel members all had a \npersonal threshold of between 20ppb and 80ppb to the reference gas (n-butanol).  A \nminimum of three dilutions at ascending concentrations were presented to the panel. \n \n2.2.2. Model experimental design \nA series of model runs were undertaken to examine the effects of changing the averaging \ntimes using the ADMS 3.1 air dispersion model (Carruthers et al, 1994; CERC, 2003).  \nADMS is a new generation, advanced steady state, Gaussian-like dispersion model.  ADMS \nis capable of modelling continuous plumes, short duration releases and complex terrain.  The \nmodel simulates point, line, area and volume sources, and can calculate the pollution or odour \nconcentration at a number of user defined receptors.  The model has been shown to perform \nin a comparable manner to similar new generation models (Hanna et al, 2000).  The model is \nwidely used in the UK by consultants as well as regulatory and government bodies. \n \nThe ADMS model was run with topographical and meteorological data for September 1997 \nto October 1998.  This time period was chosen to represent the full cycle of seasons, centred \naround the date of the odour sampling (in July 1998).  The averaging times chosen for the \nfive experiments were 60 seconds, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and 1 hour. \n \nThe freshly tipped waste and operational areas were modelled as single area sources.  Both \nsources were represented as a point source with a diameter of 70m.  Although this does not \naccurately reflect the size and shape of these sources on the ground, this was the closest \npossible fit that could be modelled.  The velocity used for the freshly tipped waste area was \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007).

The spatial dimensions \nof the active cell were represented by three separate area sources, chosen to closely represent \nthe actual dimensions of the source, each with a diameter of 100m and a velocity of 0.018 \nm\/s, again based on the outlet air volume flowrate from the Lindvall Hood during sampling.  \nThe emission rate for the active cell was divided equally between the three area sources. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Community monitoring \nThe map in Figure 1 shows the location of the monitors in relation to the landfill site.  The \nsize of the circle locating each monitor gives an indication of the number of recorded \nincidents of landfill odour at each location.  From this map, it is obvious that the most \nfrequent occurrences of landfill odour occur to the north east of the site.  The wind-rose for \nthe site (Figure 2) shows that the predominant wind direction is from the southwest, which \nwould support the observation from the community monitoring data that most of the recorded \nincidents occur to the north east of the site. \n \nDuring the study period (September 1997 to October 1998) only six separate odour incidents \nwere complained about, although the operator received more than one complaint regarding \nthree of the events.  On further examination, one of these incidents was found to be related to \na local industry that produce an odour similar to the tanker trenches on a landfill site.  The \nmajority of the complaints were made by residents of the nearby village, located to the north \nof the site. \n \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 14\n3.2. Dispersion modelling \n3.2.1. Odour emissions \nFrom each of the measured concentrations, an emission rate based on the outlet air volume \nwas calculated. These were converted to an emission rate for each of the areas (Table 2).  The \ngeometric mean of the two samples from each area was used for atmospheric dispersion \nmodelling.  The variance in the emission rates between the samples at each area was 1.78 \n(fresh waste), 3.19 (operational area) and 0.15 (active cell).   \n \nKarnik and Parry (2001) measured odour from waste deposition in the range of 60 ou\/m2\/s.  \nMore recently, Sironi et al (2005) measured a concentration of 59 ouE\/m2\/s from freshly \ntipped waste, and Nicolas et al (2005) measured a maximum concentration of 30 ouE\/m2\/s \nfrom a landfill site.  The measurements by Karnik and Parry (2001) and Sironi et al (2005) \nwere taken by direct sampling, whereas the measurements by Nicolas et al (2006) are based \non a sniffing panel, which may explain the difference.  In light of these published \nconcentrations, the odour concentrations measured at this study site are considered to be low \nand to represent a best case scenario.  The areas were chosen for sampling at random and had \nlow quantities of putrescible material on the surface, which may explain the low odour \nconcentrations measured.  In order to examine the worst case scenario, the measured \nconcentrations were multiplied by ten to reflect the published concentrations. \n \n3.2.2. Model experiments \nThe results show that with the shorter averaging times, the modelled 99th percentile \nconcentration is higher, and the odour disperses further (Figure 3).  Table 3 shows the \nmaximum concentrations for each of the averaging times.  The maximum 99th percentile \nconcentration under the shortest averaging time (1 minute) is approximately 1.2 ou\/m3 (for \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours.

In order to compare the modelled and observed results more \nclosely, 6 of the monitors were selected for further analysis.  Their location in relation to the \nlandfill site is shown in Figure 4.  The graph in Figure 5 shows the 99th percentile \nconcentration for each of these monitors, for the different averaging times.  All the results \nshow that the longer the averaging time, the lower the concentration.  For example, a 99th \npercentile concentration of 1.09 ou\/m3 is predicted with a 1 hour averaging time.  This \nconcentration increases to 2.27 ou\/m3 with a 1 minute averaging time.  This represents a two-\nfold increase in the concentration.  Mussio et al (2001) use 2 ou\/m3 as a level where odour is \nreadily detectable at a receptor.  Monitor 1 has reported incidents of landfill odour 17.2% of \nthe time during the study year, suggesting that this monitor is exposed to concentrations \nabove 2 ou\/m3 on a number of occasions.  The only modelled concentration that reflects this \nis that predicted with the shortest averaging time of 1 minute.  This pattern holds for monitors \n26, 27 and 34.  Monitor 14 is the most distant from the source of all the monitors, and so the \nmodelled concentrations are considerably lower and do not reach the 2 ou\/m3 threshold.   \n \nMonitor 35 is the closest to the source, and recorded incidents of landfill odour 19.2% of the \ndays in a year.  The modelled concentrations at this location are also the highest for all the \nmonitors.  With an averaging time of 1 hour, the 99th percentile concentration at this location \nis 2.23 ou\/m3, rising to 4.02 ou\/m3 with a 1 minute averaging time. \nDrew G.H., Smith R., Gerard V., Burge C., Lowe M., Kinnersley R., Sneath R. and Longhurst P.J. (2007). Appropriateness \nof selecting different averaging times for modelling chronic and acute exposure to environmental odours. Atmospheric \nEnvironment, 41, (13), 2870-2880. \n \n 16\n \nThe ratio of modelled frequencies to observed frequencies exceedences of 2 ou\/m3 is a useful \nindicator of how well the model predicts the observed odour frequency (Mussio et al, 2001).  \nThe closer the values are to 1, the more accurate the model prediction.  The graph (Figure 6) \nshows this ratio plotted against the observed frequency of exceedences of 2 ou\/m3 for the 1 \nhour, 15 minute and 1 minute averaging times for the six monitors.  All the values for the \nshorter (1 and 15 minutes) averaging times are closer to the ideal value of 1, suggesting that \nthe shorter averaging times provide a better prediction of the observed odour incidents than \nthe longer (1 hour) averaging time. \n \n4. Conclusions \nThis study has examined the influence of different averaging times on modelled odour \ndispersion from a landfill site.  These modelled results were compared with a community \nmonitoring database that reports incidents of odour detected in the areas surrounding the \nlandfill site.  We have shown that the current regulatory method of dispersion modelling, \nusing hourly averaging times, is less successful at capturing peak concentrations, and does \nnot capture the pattern of odour emission as indicated by the community monitoring database.  \nThe use of short averaging times produces a modelled pattern of dispersal that more closely \nmatches the observed database.  This approach is therefore of greater value in predicting the \nlikely nuisance impact of an odour source and in framing appropriate regulatory controls. \n \nAcknowledgements \nGHD is an Environment Agency supported Postdoctoral Fellow.
