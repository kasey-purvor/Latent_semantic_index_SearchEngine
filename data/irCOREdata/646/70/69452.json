Adult tissues with \ncontinuous cell turnover, such as the blood, epidermis and cornea contain tissue-specific SC \npopulations. Adult SCs are slow-cycling, have a high capacity for self-renewal and a life cycle as long \nas the lifetime of the parent organism\n1\n. SCs divide either symmetrically to produce two identical \ndaughter SCs, or asymmetrically to give rise to one SC and one transit amplifying cell. This leads to \nthe generation of all differentiated cell types\n2\n.   \nThe corneal epithelium is a well-understood SC system. Cell populations within this system are \nsegregated and spatially well-defined. The model therefore lends itself attractively to the study of SCs \nand differentiated cell types within their native tissue locations. SCs are usually confined to their \n\u201cniche\u201d, where the cells are maintained and protected\n3\n. The corneoscleral limbus is acknowledged as \nthe location for the corneal epithelial SC niche\n4,5\n. Light micrographs of the intact human corneoscleral \nlimbus and cornea are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively. Limbal trauma or disease resulting in \ncorneal stem cell deficiency are associated with severe loss of function of the ocular surface. \nTransplantation of autologous limbal SCs in patients with unilateral limbal SC deficiency can however \nresult in complete restoration of the compromised cornea\n6\n.  \n FIGURE 1 Light micrograph of the corneoscleral limbus in human cornea. The top cell layer (darker in colour) \nis the epithelium. The lower cell layer is the corneal stroma. The asterisks represent the location of the stem cell \nniche in the basal cell layer of the limbal epithelium. The arrows illustrate the migration pathway of the epithelial \ncells as they leave the stem cell niche and differentiate. Scale bar is equal to 100 \u00b5m.  \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2 Light micrograph of human cornea. The top cell layer (darker in colour) is the epithelium. The \nlower cell layer is the corneal stroma. Scale bar is equal to 100 \u00b5m.  \n \n \nThe higher aim of finding a universal SC marker goes hand-in-hand with the exploration of SCs in \ntheir environment. Any method which can be applied to aid the elucidation of SC properties will \nexpand our understanding of how SCs function. Highly spatially resolved Fourier Transform Infrared \n(FTIR) spectroscopy in combination with powerful statistical analysis techniques have been proven \nvaluable in this respect. FTIR spectroscopy is based on the principle that tissues absorb infrared (IR) \nwavelengths corresponding to the resonant frequencies of the vibrational bonds within their structure\n7\n. \nThe IR spectrum of a tissue sample will consist of a combination of absorption peaks which will tend \nto be unique to the type of tissue examined.  The technique has been applied for the characterisation \nand subsequent discrimination of bovine and human corneal SCs and differentiated cells in tissue \nsections\n8,9\n. On the basis of FTIR spectroscopy image mapping, specific infrared spectral features \nhave been proposed as markers for SCs in the gut\n10\n. FTIR spectroscopy has also been used \nsuccessfully for the detection of subtle intracellular changes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n11\n, \nbone and cartilage disorders\n12\n and different stages of the cell cycle\n13\n. The technique has furthermore \nbeen proven extremely sensitive in the diagnosis and grading of pre-malignant and malignant \nneoplasia\n14-16\n.  \nPhotothermal microspectroscopy (PTMS) is a technique which in effect combines all the benefits of \nFTIR spectroscopy\n17\n with the advantages of non-optical sensors. The PTMS experimental set-up \nconsists of a bench-top FTIR spectrometer interfaced with an atomic force microscope which is fitted \nwith a near-field resistive thermal sensing probe. The technique is used for detection of IR \nabsorbance associated heat release. The probe itself detects this temperature change as a function \nof voltage change\n18\n. Figure 3 shows a schematic illustration of the PTMS set-up. \n \nFIGURE 3 Schematic illustration of the principles involved in photothermal microspectroscopy (PTMS). Mid-\ninfrared radiation is generated by a blackbody radiator and modulated by a Michelson\u2019s interferometer contained \nwithin a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. This radiation is focused onto the biological tissue \nsection via a custom-built optical interface. IR absorption-associated heat release at the IR focal point (in yellow) \nis detected with a photothermal sensor.  \n \nThe absence of optical components in the PTMS sensor means that the technique circumvents the \ndiffraction-limited spatial resolution that conventional FTIR spectroscopy techniques are governed by. \nWith conventional FTIR spectroscopy, the practical spatial resolution will be around 12 \u00b5m when \nusing highly brilliant Synchrotron radiation only available at electron accelerator rings. With a bench-\ntop radiation source, the best resolution which does not compromise good signal-to-noise \ncharacteristics of the acquired spectra will be in the region of 50 \u00b5m\n19\n. \nThe spatial resolution with PTMS is limited mainly by the dimensions of the probe tip.  A spatial \nresolution as small as 2 \u00b5m is obtainable with a bench-top IR radiation source and the Wollaston \nprobes used in the experimental set-up\n20\n. Human corneal epithelial cells are typically 30-50 \u00b5m in \ndiameter and with nuclei of approximately 5-10 \u00b5m across\n21\n. PTMS is therefore well-suited for single-\ncell interrogation, even single-organelle examination under optimum conditions. \nIn this paper, we describe the use of PTMS for characterisation and discrimination of SCs and \ndifferentiated cells in tissue sections of human corneal epithelium.  \n \nMETHODS  \nSample preparation \nCorneal specimens were obtained from the North-West Lions Eye Bank, Seattle, WA. The corneas \nwere from male Caucasians. Eyes were harvested within 12 h of death, the corneas placed in Optisol \ncorneal preservation medium (Chiron Vision, CA) and stored at 4\u00baC for up to 5 days before use. \nCorneal samples were dissected and frozen. Cryosections (10 \u00b5m thick) were collected onto BaF2 \nslides (Photox Optical Systems, Sheffield, UK). The sections were stored in desiccators until required.  \nParallel sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological comparison.  \nPTMS instrumentation \nOur PTMS system consisted of an optical interface (Specac, Orpington, UK) in the chamber \ncompartment of the FTIR spectrometer (Vector 22 model, Bruker Optics, Coventry, UK).  The \nscanning probe microscope (Explorer model, Veeco Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was \nequipped with a Wollaston wire resistive thermal probe (Veeco Instruments).  The probe tip and \nsample were brought to the IR focal point to maximise the photothermal signal. \nData acquisition and processing \nPrior to sample measurements, probe tips were cleaned by Joule heating by applying a current of 100 \nmA (~600\no\nC).  Photothermal interferograms were averaged over time (typically 3,000 co-additions) for \nenhancement of signal-to-noise characteristics, followed by conversion by Fourier transformation to \nspectra displaying photothermal amplitude expressed as a function of wavenumber (cm\n-1\n).  Spectral \ndata were sampled at 8 cm\n-1\n intervals.  Atmospheric background spectra were taken in non-contact \nmode and inspected to ensure that the tip was free from biological contamination.  Sample spectra \nwere taken with the probe lowered onto the cell populations of interest, which were the stem cells \n(n=26) in the basal limbal region and differentiated cells (n=26) from the mid-periphery of the corneal \nepithelium. \nData processing and statistical analysis \nData acquisition and atmospheric background correction were carried out in OPUS software (Bruker \nOptics).  Baseline correction, normalisation and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed \nwith Pirouette software (Infometrix Inc., Bothell, WA, USA).  Narrowband regions containing noise \narising from mains electric pick-up were excluded from analysis.  These regions were centered on \n1082 cm\n-1\n and on 1442 cm\n-1\n, corresponding to the 2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n harmonics from the mains electric \nvibrations respectively.  Spectral regions outside of the biomolecular range from 1800 cm\n-1\n to  \n900 cm\n-1\n were also excluded.  Median spectra were calculated in Microsoft Excel.  \nMann-Whitney calculations were performed in R statistical software 2.2.1. The Mann-Whitney test is \nnon-parametric and calculates the probability of two groups of values being drawn from the same \ndistribution by chance. A calculated P value of 0.01 means that there is only a 1% probability of the \ntwo groups of values being drawn from the same distribution. In other words, 99% confidence that the \ntwo groups are statistically different. \nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA) computations of class-specific loadings were also calculated in R \nfrom the factor-specific loadings found by PCA\n22\n. The class-specific loadings display the variance of \neach cell class relative to the all classes in the data set. In the case of a data set with only two \nclasses, the two class-specific loading plots will therefore be mirror-images of each other. The \nabsolute values of these two loading plots will in this case be the same. Displaying the absolute \nloading plot will avoid artifacts of zero loading value between successive data points with opposite \nsigns.  \nQuadratic discriminant distributions were calculated from PCA factors in the Discriminant Analysis \nadd-on toolbox for Matlab\n23\n.  \n \n \nRESULTS:  \n \nFIGURE 4 All acquired spectra, showing subtle but consistent variations with cell type. Large portions of \nspectral similarities across cell type arise from all cells being part of the same tissue type.  Narrowband \nfluctuations centred on 1082 cm\n-1\n and on 1442 cm\n-1\n correspond to pick-up noise from the 2\nnd\n and 3\nrd\n harmonics \nfrom the mains electric vibrations. These two narrowband regions were therefore excluded from statistical \nanalysis.  \n \n \nFIGURE 5 Principal component analysis cluster plot showing perfect segregation of data derived from PTMS \nmeasurements of stem cells and differentiated cells of human corneal epithelium.  \n FIGURE 6 Quadratic discriminant analysis representation of principal component data points shown in figure \n5, demonstrating the Gaussian distributions of the data clusters from the different cell populations of stem cells \nand differentiated cells.  \n \n \nFIGURE 7 P values from the Mann-Whitney test for statistically significant differences between spectra from \nstem cells and differentiated cells, shown as a function of wavenumber. The red line represents the 95% \nconfidence level. All portions of the plot below this line are statistically significant to this level of confidence or \nbetter.  \n \n FIGURE 8 Absolute values of class-specific loadings. These were calculated by linear discriminant analysis \nfrom factor-specific loadings computed by principal component analysis. The peaks represent the principal \nwavenumbers responsible for the separation of cell classes in the principal component clusterplot (see figure 5). \n \n \nFIGURE 9 Difference spectrum of median differentiated cell spectrum minus median stem cell spectrum. \nTroughs and peaks highlight the main wavenumbers at which photothermal spectra from the two cell types differ.  \n \nFigure 4 shows all acquired spectra from both classes of cells. Figure 5 demonstrates segregation of \ndata derived from SCs and differentiated cells into separate clusters after PCA. Figure 6 shows the \nquadratic discriminant representations of the same data. Each disc has the shape of the Gaussian \ndistribution of the data cluster used for its generation.  \nFigures 7 to 9 highlight the wavenumbers at which spectra from SCs and differentiated cells are the \nmost dissimilar. Figure 7 shows the P values from the Mann-Whitney test for statistical significant \ndifferences between spectra from the two cell types. The most highly significant values are those with \nlowest P values. The red horizontal line describes the 95% confidence level, and all portions of the \ngraph below this line are statistically significant above this level of confidence. Figure 8 shows the \nabsolute values of the class-specific loadings from PCA. This plot identifies the principal \nwavenumbers responsible for the separation of spectral data into segregated clusters\n16\n. Figure 9 \nshows the subtraction spectrum of the median SC spectrum from the median differentiated cell \nspectrum.  \nThe main wavenumbers responsible for the separation of spectra from SCs and differentiated cell \ntypes are those in the region of 1710-1700 cm\n-1\n (figures 6,7 and 8), around of 1590 cm\n-1\n (figures 7 \nand 8), the region of 1480 cm\n-1\n (figure 7 and 8), the region of 1400 cm\n-1\n (figures 7,8 and 9), 1240 cm\n-1 \n(figure 8), 1200-1190 cm\n-1\n (figures 7,8 and 9), region 1155 cm\n-1 \n(figures 7,8 and 9) and the region \naround 1000-950 cm\n-1 \n(figures 7,8 and 9).  \nDifferences in the region of 1710-1700 cm\n-1 \nmay be attributed to C=O stretching vibrations of nucleic \nacids\n7\n. Activity around 1590 cm\n-1 \nis most certainly due to C=N stretching in guanine. The vibrational \nbond responsible for the 1480 cm\n-1 \npeak can be more difficult to assign. The peak is in the middle of \nthe protein range from around 1640 cm\n-1\n  to 1240 to cm\n-1\n \n24\n, and also at one extreme of the end of the \ncomplex absorption profile from 1480 cm\n-1\n to1450 cm\n-1\n arising from CH2 scissoring and CH3 \nasymmetric bending vibrations of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids\n7\n. Absorptions at 1400 cm\n-1\n can be \ndue to COO\n-\n symmetrical stretching vibrations of fatty acids and amino acids\n7\n or C-H bend in amino \nacid residues\n24\n. 1240 cm\n-1 \nis the peak for C-N stretch and N-H bend of the protein amide III. The \nregion around 1200-1190 cm\n-1 \nis within the broadband phosphate range from 1200-900 cm\n-1  25\n and \nmay therefore be assigned to phosphate activity. The narrow region around 1160-1150 cm\n-1 \nis \nassociated with carbohydrate\n16\n or with C-O stretch in DNA\n24\n.  Finally, the band around 1000-950 cm\n-1 \nis associated with sugar ring vibrations\n26\n and C-O and C-C stretch in DNA\n24\n.  \nDISCUSSION \nCovalently bonded atoms absorb IR radiation corresponding to the specific resonant frequencies of \ntheir vibrational motions\n24\n. It is on this basis that FTIR spectroscopy can be used for characterisation \nof biological materials such as cultured cells or tissue sections. PTMS is a technique which combines \nthe benefits of conventional FTIR spectroscopy with the advantages of near-field non-optical sensors. \nPTMS overcomes the diffraction limitations which restrict the spatial resolution of beam-focussing \nsensors\n27\n, like those employed with FTIR spectroscopy, to a practical minimum of around 12 \u00b5m in \nthe IR range\n19\n. This optimum level of resolution requires the use of synchrotron radiation, which is \nonly available at very few electron accelerator rings worldwide. The spatial resolution of PTMS is \nlimited mainly by the dimensions of the probe tip and by the thermal diffusion length in the sample \nmaterial\n28\n. In practical terms, this allows for spatial resolution in the region of 2 \u00b5m even when using a \nbench-top radiation source.  Single cell measurements are therefore perfectly possible with this \ninstrumentation. Furthermore, PTMS circumvents the inherent shortcoming with FTIR detectors of \nnon-linearity at high absorbance values, which causes distortions of relative signal intensities and \nband shapes\n29\n. PTMS is based on the detection of IR absorption associated heat release. IR opacity \nof the sample does therefore not cause signal distortion. This makes PTMS advantageous over \nconventional FTIR spectroscopy in samples where IR transmission can be low, such as cellular \nmaterial containing nuclei with densely packed chromatin strands\n30\n. \nIR spectroscopy data from different cell populations within the same tissue will demonstrate a lot of \nsimilarities as well as some variation between the cell types. Powerful statistical analysis techniques \nare often required to extract consistent but subtle variance between cell types. For this purpose PCA, \nbeing a form of multivariate analysis, is a suitably sensitive statistical analysis method. PCA reduces \nthe number of data entries per spectrum with emphasis on variance rather than similarities in the data \nset as a whole, with the end result of describing the data in typically 5 to 9 principal components \n(PCs) or dimensions. Of these, three PCs can be displayed at any one time in a pseudo-3D cluster \nplot. Each PC contains a certain percentage of variability of the original data, and each cluster plot will \ndisplay the extent of variation of all spectra in the three selected dimensions. Closeness of data points \nin multivariate hyperspace implies similarity, whereas relative separation means more differences\n32\n. \nMedical interventions involving the use of SCs offer great clinical potential\n3,32\n. To date, many tissue-\nspecific adult SC populations have not been identified, and a definitive stem cell marker universal to \nall tissue types has not been found. The absence of idiosyncratic morphology or other features \nspecific to SCs can make their presence difficult to pinpoint\n32\n. That a definitive SC \u201cmarker\u201d, universal \nto all tissue types, is yet to be identified is perhaps more of a reflection of the relative featurelessness \nof the cell type than a shortcoming of the decades of scientific effort invested in this quest. The search \nfor markers specific to the limbal SC population has lead to the discovery of a number of molecules \nselectively expressed by these cells and not by other cell populations in the same tissue, including \np63 and the keratin pair K5\/K14. The absence of gap junction proteins is a further limbal SC \nindicator\n34\n. \nIR spectroscopy methods are used for examination of all biomolecules present in a sample. It can \ntherefore be advantageous over methods used to identify cells on the basis of single molecular types \nonly. Previous work\n35\n has demonstrated that bench-top PTMS is more sensitive than synchrotron \nradiation FTIR spectroscopy in terms of ability to discriminate between SCs, transit amplifying and \nterminally differentiated cells in tissue sections of bovine cornea. Proposed reasons for this finding \nwere two-fold. Firstly, the spatial resolution with PTMS is at least as good as that obtained with \nsynchrotron radiation FTIR spectroscopy, thus reducing the chance of sampling across cell population \nboundaries. Secondly, PTMS measures IR absorption directly rather than, as with FTIR spectroscopy, \nas a computation from infrared transmission through a sample.  \nWe have shown that PTMS in conjunction with PCA can separate spectra derived from SCs and \ndifferentiated cells into discrete data clusters in multidimensional hyperspace. The predominant \nwavenumbers responsible for the segregation are found around the 1700 cm\n-1\n peak indicative of \nnucleic acids\n7\n and in the range 1490 cm\n-1 \nto 1000 cm\n-1 \nwhich indicates IR absorption by nucleic acids \nand\/or changes in chromatin structure\n36\n. Further differences in the region from 1000-950 cm\n-1 \ndenoting DNA\n23\n reinforces the inference that the spectral dissimilarities between the SC and \ndifferentiated cell populations are extracted from changes in nucleic acid composition and structure. \nThe PTMS spectral resolution of 8\n \ncm\n-1 \ndoes not allow for a higher degree of specificity as regards \nassignment of vibrational bond peaks. Statistical analysis of PTMS spectra from SCs and \ndifferentiated cells in sections of human cornea supports previously published FTIR spectroscopy \nresults on the same model in humans\n8\n and PTMS work on the same tissue type from bovine\n35\n. The \nfinding that PTMS detects differences in nucleic acids between the SC and differentiated cell \npopulations in the human corneal epithelium is consistent with reports of SC differentiation being \ntriggered by chromatin modifications\n37\n.  \nCONCLUSION \nWe have shown that PTMS can be used for characterisation of SCs and differentiated cells in tissue \nsections of human cornea. We demonstrate for the first time that PTMS spectra collected from these \ntwo cell types form distinctly separate data clusters after PCA. Some of the spectral bands \nresponsible for the separation of data derived from SCs and differentiated cells correspond to nucleic \nacid structure and function. Each PTMS spectrum provides a broad range of biomolecular \ninformation, in contrast to techniques which identify cells on the basis of the presence or absence of \nsingle molecular groups. The work presented in this article is promising with respect to the \ndevelopment of PTMS spectra as sensitive markers for SC in tissue samples where high spatial \nresolution is a requirement.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThis work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, UK (grant \nnumber BB\/D010055\/1) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, UK. \n \n  [1] P.A.
