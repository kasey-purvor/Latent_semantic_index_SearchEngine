Many of the features of the ab initio\nspectra can be understood within the SFA.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevA.71.021402 PACS numberssd: 32.80.Rm, 32.80.Wr, 42.50.Hz\nMost of the electrons ejected from atoms by strong, low-\nfrequency, linearly polarized laser pulses have a relatively\nlow energy, somewhat below twice the ponderomotive en-\nergy. It is well established that the ejection of electrons of\nhigher energy, belonging to the plateau part of the above-\nthreshold ionization sATId spectra, can in many respects be\ndescribed within the strong-field approximation sSFAd and\nbe explained by the simple semiclassical model with which\nthe SFA is associated f1,2g. The question thus arises as to\nhow well can the ejection of slow electrons be understood\nwithin this approximation. Of central importance in this\nproblem is the role of the long-range Coulomb interaction\nbetween the outgoing photoelectron and the residual core. It\nhas been known for a long time that the accuracy with which\nthis interaction can be taken into account within the SFA is\nsufficient for obtaining correct total probabilities of ioniza-\ntion f3\u20136g. The SFA has also been shown to be reliable for\nlow-order above-threshold detachment from negative ions,\nfor which there is no long-range Coulomb interaction in the\nfinal state f7,8g. However, there are also indications that the\nlow-energy photoelectrons ejected from atoms or positive\nions in strong fields might be so much affected by the\nelectron-core interaction that SFA-type theories would be un-\nable to explain their angular and energy distributions, even in\nthe adiabatic regime f9g. In this Rapid Communication, we\nshow that a good description of their spectra can nonetheless\nbe achieved within this approximation for a wide range of\nangles of ejection, if the binding energy of the initial state is\nsufficiently large and the intensity sufficiently high. Our ap-\nproach is based on Keldysh\u2019s length gauge formulation of the\nSFA. We neglect backscattering but make allowance for the\neffect of the Coulomb interaction on the continuum electron\nthrough a simple quasiclassical approximation f10g. The cor-\nresponding expression of the ionization amplitude is derived\nin the following paragraphs. Atomic units are used through-\nout the paper, except where specified otherwise.\nWe assume the dipole approximation and describe the la-\nser pulse by a vector potential of the form Astd\n= sF0 \/vde\u02c6astdsinsvt+fd, with e\u02c6 the polarization vector, v\nthe carrier\u2019s angular frequency, f the carrier-envelope phase,\nand astd a function varying between 0 and 1 and defining the\nenvelope of the pulse. The latter is taken to be a sin2 function\nin the numerical calculation, with a total width smeasured at\nthe basisd of either 4 or 2 optical cycles. The corresponding\nelectric-field component of the pulse is Fstd=\u2212]tAstd. We\nalso consider that the pulse lasts from a time ti to a time tf\nsuch that Astd and Fstd are both negligible for t\u0142 ti and t\n\u00f8 tf. We aim at calculating the amplitude for the electron to\nbe at a time T\u00f8 tf in a field-free continuum state uFpsTdl of\nasymptotic momentum p if for t, ti it is in the field-free\nbound state uF0stdl. This amplitude can be written in terms of\nthe dipole operator and of the time-evolution operator for the\natom in the field, as f1g\nAp0 = \u2212 iE\nti\ntf\ndtkFpsTduUsT,tdHdipstduF0stdl . s1d\nThe matrix element kFpsTduUsT , tdHdipstduF0stdl is the pro-\njection of HdipstduF0stdl on the state vector which, at time T,\nreduces to uFpsTdl. Assuming the normalization\nkFpsTduFp8sTdl=dsp\u2212p8d, the density of probability that an\nelectron is detached by the pulse with a final kinetic energy\nE= p2 \/2 in the direction of the vector p is PsE , p\u02c6d= puAp0u2.\nIn Keldysh\u2019s formulation of the SFA, the interaction of\nthe electron with the field is described within the length\ngauge, kruFpsTdl is taken to be a plane wave of momentum\np, and the interaction of the unbound electron with the re-\nsidual core is neglected between times t and T. Accordingly,\nkFpsTduUsT , tdurl is taken to be the complex conjugate of the\nVolkov wave function\nCpsr,td =\n1\ns2pd3\/2\nexpFipsp,td \u00b7 r + i2Et\nT\ndt8p2sp,t8dG ,\ns2d\nwhere psp , td=p+Astd is the kinematical momentum of the\nelectron. Within this approach, the interaction of the electron\nwith the core is taken into account only in the initial wave\nfunction, F0sr , td;kruF0stdl. As noted by Krainov and\nShokri f5g, the effect of this interaction during tunneling can\nalso be taken into account, approximately, by multiplying\nCpsr , td by the factor Isrd= f4Ip \/ sF0rdgZ\/\u02db2Ip, with Z the\ncharge of the residual ion and Ip the binding energy of the\ninitial state. Adopting this correction yields the \u201ctunneling\ncorrected\u201d ionization amplitude\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 71, 021402sRd s2005d\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n1050-2947\/2005\/71s2d\/021402s4d\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society021402-1\nAp0\nsTCd\n= \u2212 iE\nti\ntf\ndtE dr Cp*sr,tdIsrdfr \u00b7 FstdgF0sr,td . s3d\nIn this work, we concentrate on the case of a hydrogenic\nion initially in the ground state, for which F0sr , td\n=B exps\u2212krd \/\u02db4p expsIptd, with k= s2Ipd1\/2 and B=2k3\/2.\nIntegration over time using the saddle-point method gives\nf11g\nAp0\nsTCd\n=\nB\nip\u02db8S2k\n2\nF0\nDo\nts\n\u02db 2pi\nS9sp,tsd\nexp fiSsp,tsdg . s4d\nIn this equation,\nSsp,td = \u2212\n1\n2Et\nT\ndt8p2sp,t8d + Ipt s5d\nand the scomplexd times ts are the saddle points of Ssp , td,\ni.e., the times at which p2sp , td \/2+ Ip=0.\nHad we omitted the factor Isrd in Eq. s3d, the ionization\namplitude would have reduced to a short-pulse form of the\nfamiliar Keldysh amplitude, namely\nAp0\nsKd\n= \u2212 iE\nti\ntf\ndtE dr Cp*sr,tdfr \u00b7 FstdgF0sr,td . s6d\nThis integral is also amenable to saddle-point integration,\nalthough the integrand is singular at the saddle times for our\ninitial wave function f8g.

Results are presented for an\nHe+ ion irradiated by a 4-cycle 800-nm pulse. Also shown in\nFig. 1 is the probability obtained under the assumption that\ndetachment proceeds at any time as if the electric field was\nstatic.

Given that it is small, one\ncan expect Pstat to be a good approximation of the exact\ndetachment probability. As seen from the figure, at the inten-\nsities considered, the SFA probability without the correction\nfactor is somewhat smaller than Pstat. sDepletion, which is\nnot taken into account in our estimate of Ptot, is not negli-\ngible at intensities above 131016 W cm\u22122.d The correction\nfactor brings the SFA probability much closer to Pstat.\nAs is well known, at high intensity the complex saddle\ntimes ts that contribute most to the ionization amplitude s4d\nhave a small imaginary part and differ little from the real\ndetachment times td of the semiclassical model, which are\nthe times at which psp , td \u00b7 e\u02c6=0.

Clearly, Eqs. s13d and s14d lose\ntheir meaning if the electron approaches the Coulomb singu-\nlarity too closely.\nIllustrative energy spectra are presented in Figs. 2 and 3\nfor the case of an He+ ion irradiated by a few-cycle pulse\nwith a carrier wavelength of 400 nm and a peak intensity of\n131016 W cm\u22122. The corresponding value of the Keldysh\nparameter g is 0.42 and the ponderomotive energy is 149 eV.\nThe figures give the density of probability PsE , p\u02c6d as ob-\ntained using either Eq. s9d or Eq. s14d , for different values of\nthe angle of ejection u and of the carrier-envelope phase f.\nsThe angle u is measured with respect to the polarization\nvector e\u02c6.d The SFA results are compared with the momentum\ndistribution of the photoelectron at the end of the pulse cal-\nculated ab initio by solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation numerically f15g. Correspondingly, we set T= tf in\nthe SFA calculations.\nIn the cases considered in Fig. 2, the SFA results are, on\nthe whole, in quantitative agreement with the ab initio re-\nsults, although the position and the shape of the peaks differ\nat very low energy. Note that these peaks are not ATI peaks\nin the usual sense, which would be found for longer laser\npulses. When correctly predicted by the SFA, they can be\nascribed to quantum inferferences between photoelectrons\nwith a same final kinetic energy but different trajectories f8g.\nThey are not regularly spaced and their position varies with\nthe angle of ejection. In the CTC-SFA, the Coulomb force\nacting on the continuum electron merely changes the phase\nrelationship of the different trajectories. The change can be\nconsiderable, as some of the trajectories scorresponding to\nthe \u201cindirect wave packets\u201d of Ref. f9gd remain in the vicin-\nity of the nucleus for much longer than others. It affects the\nspectrum mainly by shifting and deforming the peaks. The\nnet effect, in Fig. 2, is to bring the CTC-SFA results close to\nthe ab initio results above 10 eV f16g. In the case of Fig. 3,\nthe position of the peaks is accurately predicted by the SFA\ncalculations over the entire energy range considered, particu-\nlarly when the Coulomb correction in the continuum is in-\ncluded, but their relative magnitude is not as well reproduced\nas in Fig. 2.\nFor ejection between 10\u00b0 and 170\u00b0 from the direction of\npolarization, the level of agreement between the CTC-SFA\nresults and the ab initio results is comparable to that shown\nby Figs. 2 and 3, if not better. The agreement deteriorates\nbelow 10\u00b0 and above 170\u00b0. This is not surprising, since elec-\ntrons ejected close to the polarization direction may pass\nclose to the Coulomb singularity.\nThe authors thank B.

See Ref. f1g for calculations of recol-\nlisional ATI based on the Born approximation.\nf11g It is convenient to integrate by parts over time, so as to express\nthe integral in terms of the Fourier transform of IsrdF0sr , td\nwith respect to the momentum p. Contributions from the end\npoints ti and tf arise both from the integration by parts and\nfrom the asymptotic expansion involved in the saddle-point\nintegration. However, it can be shown that their sum is negli-\ngibly small if Fstd vanishes sufficienty smoothly at ti and tf. In\nthis case, the ionization probability does not depend on the\ndetail of the variation of the vector potential at the very begin-\nning and the very end of the pulse, in agreement with one\u2019s\nintuition.\nf12g M.
