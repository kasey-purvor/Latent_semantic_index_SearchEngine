Bacteria are simpler than humans, if only because humans\ncontain millions of (interacting) cells, each much more complex than bacteria. Sponges are simpler than\nflatworms, which are simpler than trilobites, which are simpler than birds. This crude, large-scale\ngrowth of the maximum of complexity seems to hold for any notion of organismal complexity we\nknow of (and, as we will see, there are quite a few of them). To our knowledge, no serious author has\nexplicitly denied an overall increase in the maximum of complexity at a global scale, though some have\nurged caution [35]. At a slightly lower scale, there is some evidence that the maximum number of cell\ntypes (a common measure of organismal complexity) has increased over time within metazoans [6, 53].\nFaced with such a remarkable increase in complexity, some authors have suggested a fundamental\ntendency of evolution to create more and more complexity. This position actually predates Darwin,\nbeing found in Lamarck. One variant of this notion is the arrow-of-complexity hypothesis [4]:[The] hypothesis of the arrow of complexity asserts that the complex functional\norganization of the most complex products of open-ended evolutionary systems\nhas a general tendency to increase with time.Artificial Life 14: 325\u2013344 (2008)\nTT, UK. E-mail: t.miconi@cs.bham.ac.uk\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiIt turns out that this apparently straightforward statement has generated significant amounts of\nconfusion and misunderstanding. We need not go very far to find one example: In the same article,\nthe author goes on to express that this hypothesis is not accepted by Gould [24], Maynard Smith and\nSzathma\u00b4ry [32], and McShea [35]. Yet these authors, and those works, do not deny that the com-\nplexity of the most complex organism increases in evolution. At most, McShea professes \u2018\u2018emphatic\nagnosticism.\u2019\u2019 Gould, however, writes (p. 169): \u2018\u2018I do not challenge the statement that the most complex\ncreature has tended to increase in elaboration through time\u2019\u2019\u2014an almost verbatim statement of the\narrow-of-complexity hypothesis.1 As for Maynard Smith and Szathma\u00b4ry, their book is a description of\nseveral successive \u2018\u2018major transitions\u2019\u2019 in the history of evolution, many of which can reasonably be\ninterpreted as increases in complexity (more precisely, hierarchical complexity [35]).\nHow can such confusion arise? The crux of the matter, of course, is that while nobody seems to\nutterly deny the fact that maximum complexity has increased over the entire course of evolution,\nthere is much debate regarding the interpretation of this fact: As we will see, what these authors\nexplicitly question is not that increasingly complex individuals are found in nature, but rather the\nnotion of a built-in evolutionary drive, or bias, towards increased complexity in evolution.\nIt is one of the achievements of recent evolutionary theory to have shown that this controversy\nresults in no small part from a conjunction of misunderstandings. The crux of the matter is that the\nquestion of whether \u2018\u2018there is a tendency for complexity to increase in evolution\u2019\u2019 is a highly am-\nbiguous question. This is because almost every word in it can be understood in many different ways,\nleading to much unnecessary confusion. When fuller attention is given to details (and to the implicit\nassumptions that may lurk behind apparently innocuous terms), it is realized that the sustained\ngrowth of maximum or average complexity does not necessarily imply a pervasive bias towards\ncomplexity in evolution.2 What is Complexity?\n2.1 Descriptive and Functional Complexity\nIf we are to study the relationship between evolution and complexity, we need to explain what we call\n\u2018\u2018complexity\u2019\u2019 in the first place, if only to avoid misunderstandings. It turns out that definitions and\nmeasures of complexity abound throughout the literature (for a broad panorama see [15, 35, 1]). We\nwill concentrate specifically on two notions of complexity, which we believe are of particular interest\nwhen discussing the effects of Darwinian evolution: descriptive (or morphological) complexity, and\nfunctional complexity.\nDescriptive or morphological complexity is easily defined: It is the amount of information that is\nnecessary to describe an object. In the words of Dawkins [11]: \u2018\u2018A crab is morphologically more\ncomplex than a millipede because, if you wrote a pair of books describing each animal down to\nthe same level of detail, the crab book would have a higher word-count than the millipede book. The\nmillipede book would describe a typical segment then simply add that, with listed exceptions, the\nother segments are the same. The crab book would require a separate chapter for each segment and\nwould therefore have a higher information content.\u2019\u2019 However, very much in the same way as with\nShannon entropy (another measure of information content), it turns out to be maximal for com-\npletely disordered objects. A pile of rubble consists of many more parts, each much more different\nfrom any other, than a standing wall of bricks, so its descriptive complexity would be higher.\nWhat about functional complexity? We choose to simply define functional complexity as the\ndescriptive complexity of a functional system. A \u2018\u2018system\u2019\u2019 is any set of interacting parts. We call it\n\u2018\u2018functional\u2019\u2019 if the interaction of the parts produces a certain external result, which would not be1 In a different, related piece [23], Gould writes: \u2018\u2018No one can doubt that more complex creatures arose sequentially after this\nprokaryotic beginning\u2014 first eukaryotic cells, perhaps about two billion years ago, then multicellular animals about 600 million years ago,\nwith a relay of highest complexity among animals passing from invertebrates, to marine vertebrates and, finally (if we wish, albeit\nparochially, to honor neural architecture as a primary criterion), to reptiles, mammals and humans.\u2019\u2019\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3326\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconiobtained if some (or any) of the parts failed to behave just as it does. Note that the result must come\nfrom the actual interaction of active parts, not just from their mere existence. Functional complexity\nis simply descriptive complexity applied to any such functional system, that is, a growing function of\nthe number of parts and of their mutual differences.\nWhile we admit that this is a rather crude definition, we believe that it does capture much of the\nintuitive notion of functional complexity within a system. In particular, it does retain the idea of\ndifficulty (in a design sense), or improbability, which we associate with highly complex biological\nfeatures: Clearly a certain system that depends on the precise behavior of many parts is somehow\nmore improbable or surprising than one that only depends on the collaboration of a few. Similarly, it\nstands to reason that systems relying on the interactions of many similar parts are somehow easier to\narrive at than systems relying on the precise features of many differentiated parts.\nThis notion of functional complexity may be contrasted with that of Heylighen [25], which\nemphasizes the joint occurrence of separation and interconnection; or with that of Dawkins [10],\nwhich stresses the improbability of the result (rather than the \u2018\u2018emerging improbability\u2019\u2019 resulting\nfrom the highly constrained interactions of many parts). For example, in our view, Rube Goldberg\ncontraptions (phantasmagoric constructions in which highly intricate machinery is used to obtain\ntrivial results) would be regarded as functionally complex, whereas Dawkins\u2019 view would regard\nthem as comparatively noncomplex, due to their underwhelming output. Functional complexity, in\nour sense, is more about the functioning than the function being performed.2.2 Implications of the Definitions\nWith this notion of functional complexity in mind, we can already make a few inferences. The most\nimportant one is that adaptive functional complex systems are rare in the space of all possible\nsystems. Any given set of parts is unlikely to be actually performing any meaningful function, let\nalone an adaptive one. This unlikeliness increases with the descriptive complexity of the system: The\nmore parts there are, the more improbable it is that they will harmoniously cooperate (a requirement\nfor functional complexity). This is important, because it implies that generating random systems\nwould be a very inefficient way to come up with functionally complex systems, while other search\nmethods (such as Darwinian evolution) might, under the right conditions, prove more successful.\nAnother observation is that although adaptive functional complexity is rare in the space of all\nsystems, it comes in loose clusters: coming up with a new, more complex, yet still successful design is\ntypically much easier if we use an already complex, successful design as a starting point. More\nprecisely, slightly altering a successful complex system has a higher chance of yielding another system\nof equivalent or higher complexity than random search. If we have access to the mechanism of a\nworking clock, random alterations to this existing mechanism are much more likely to result in other\nworking clocks than random assemblages of gears. Importantly, this is not a logical necessity; rather,\nit is a reasonable inference, which we may assume holds for many system spaces.3 What is a Tendency?\nWhile having a working notion of complexity is important, it appears that much of the confusion\nactually derives from the notion of tendency. What do we mean when we say that the maximum or\naverage complexity \u2018\u2018tends\u2019\u2019 to increase in evolution?3.1 Trends, Passive Trends, and Driven Trends\nMcShea [34, 35, 37] has devoted much work to the conceptual clarification of trends and mechanisms\nin evolution. The most widely known result of this work is probably the operative distinction\nbetween passive and driven trends. A trend is any sustained directional change in a summary statistic\nof a certain quantity (such as maximum or average size, complexity, etc.) within a particular clade.\nSuch a trend is called driven if it can be shown to result from a pervasive, consistent bias, applying toArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 327\nFigure 1. Passive and driven trends. In both of these graphs, the maximum and the average follow a trend of sustained\nincrease through time. In the left-hand graph, these trends are passive: The branching process is not biased towards\nhigher or lower values. A trend in the maximum emerges mechanically by envelope expansion. A trend in the average\nalso emerges, because the process is constrained by a hard lower bound that cannot be crossed. Both trends, resulting\nfrom a globally unbiased process, are passive. In the right-hand graph, however, the trends of increase in the average and\nthe maximum are driven: The underlying branching process is clearly biased towards higher values.\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconiall subclades; for example, if speciation or extinction events are consistently biased towards higher\nvalues of the quantity. Passive trends, on the other hand, are those that occur mechanically in globally\nunbiased processes, possibly constrained by a local inhomogeneity\u2014for example, a hard boundary\nthat the value cannot cross. Figure 1 illustrates this distinction graphically.\nIt is important to note that passive trends may well be enforced by active, external forces, such as\nnatural selection. For example, we might have a situation where no member of a certain clade is se-\nlectively viable below a certain size, or complexity level. In this case, provided there is no constraint\non the maximum, the average would grow mechanically over time.\nFurthermore, even in a globally passive trend, the small-scale behavior of each individual lineage\nmay well be everywhere governed by a local, driven trend\u2014as long as these many local trends do\nnot exhibit any consistent global direction. In other words, passive trends may well be everywhere driven2\n[34, p. 1751]. Conversely, nonselective forces may enforce driven trends. Thus the important dis-\ntinction between passive and driven trends does not lie in the source or mechanism of the bias that\ncreates this trend, but solely on whether this bias is local or pervasive, respectively, throughout the\nspace explored by the clade [37].\n3.2 Benefits of the Terminology\nThis sound terminology goes a long way to identify (and prevent) possible sources of misunder-\nstandings. Restated in McShea\u2019s terminology, the arrow-of-complexity hypothesis simply states that\nevolution spontaneously generates a trend of increase in the maximum of organismal complexity\nover time. It is silent on the question of whether this trend is driven (the result of a pervasive bias in\nDarwinian evolution towards higher complexity) or passive (the result of a direction-blind branching\nprocess, mechanically pushing the external envelope).\nWe can now see where much of the controversy arises: What some authors (especially Gould\n[24]) reject is not the existence of the trend, but the idea that it should necessarily be driven, rather\nthan passive. This, in turn, seems to be misconstrued by others as denying the existence of the trend\nitself, or the role of evolution in its emergence: The implicit assumption is that any trend must of\nnecessity be driven, and therefore, that denying bias is tantamount to rejecting the trend itself. This\nseems to explain why Gould, for example, is portrayed as a \u2018\u2018skeptic\u2019\u2019 regarding the existence of a\ntrend [4], or even as denying that \u2018\u2018complexity increases in evolution\u2019\u2019 [1]. Gould, as we saw, certainly2 This point deserves particular attention: In everyday language, the words \u2018\u2018passive\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018driven\u2019\u2019 seem to be mutually exclusive. But in\nMcShea\u2019s terminology, a trend is passive if it is globally unbiased, which does not imply that its local behavior at any point must be: Even in a\nglobally unbaised (passive) branching process, each particular branch may well be strongly biased (driven) in its own local direction. Any\noverall trend will still be called passive if the many local biases are uncorrelated, resulting in a globally unbiased process.\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3328\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconiagrees that complexity increases in evolution: What he rejected was the idea of a general, pervasive\nbias or drive towards complexity. This illustrates the high potential for confusion that lies behind\nsuch deceptively straightforward terms as \u2018\u2018trend\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018tendency.\u2019\u20194 Reformulating the Question\nUsing McShea\u2019s terminology, we can now reframe our previously ambiguous question in a more\nsatisfactory manner. We admit that, at a sufficiently large scale, there has been a trend of increasing\ncomplexity in evolution: There has (so far) been an arrow of complexity from exclusively simple\nforms to a variety of simple and complex forms. This point is uncontroversial and widely accepted,\nthough appropriate caution is necessary [35]. We are now left with two questions:\n1. Has this trend been driven (whether by selection or by some other mechanism), or passive?\nIs there a built-in bias in evolution to push average or maximum complexity preferentially\nupwards, in general?\n2. What is the role of the evolutionary mechanism in the emergence of this trend? What are\nthe necessary conditions for the arrow of complexity to arise in Darwinian evolution?\nThe following sections will address both questions in turn.5 Theoretical Justifications for a Driven Complexity Growth\nIt is interesting that, independently of the evidence for or against a general, driven trend of increasing\ncomplexity in evolution, several theoretical justifications have been suggested for such a driven trend.\nWe will discuss a few typical examples.5.1 The Assumption of Complexity Advantage\nAn apparently common (though often implicit) viewpoint is that functional complexity should be\nfavored by selection, in general, because living organisms can generally be made more efficient by\nincreasing their functional complexity. A statement of this position is apparently offered by Darwin\nhimself, in the crucial fourth chapter of the Origins of Species [9] (quoted with this intent by\nRosslenbroich [45]):ArtIf we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of differentiation and\nspecialisation of the several organs in each being when adult . . . , natural selection clearly\nleads towards this standard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs,\ninasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is an advantage to each being;\nand hence the accumulation of variations tending towards specialisation is within the scope\nof natural selection.However, the continuation of this passage (not quoted by Rosslenbroich) paints an altogether\ndifferent picture:On the other hand, we can see . . . that it is quite possible for natural selection gradually to\nfit a being to a situation in which several organs would be superfluous or useless: in such\ncases there would be retrogression in the scale of organisation . . . .But it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in the scale, how is it that\nthroughout the world a multitude of the lowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each great classificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 329\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconisome forms are far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more highly developed\nforms everywhere supplanted and exterminated the lower? On our theory the continued existence of\nlowly organisms offers no difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, does not\nnecessarily include progressive development\u2014it only takes advantage of such variations as arise and\nare beneficial to each creature under its complex relations of life. And it may be asked what\nadvantage, as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian animalcule\u2014to an intestinal worm\u2014or\neven to an earthworm, to be highly organised. If it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by\nnatural selection, unimproved or but little improved, and might remain for indefinite ages in their\npresent lowly condition. And geology tells us that some of the lowest forms, such as the infusoria\nand rhizopods, have remained for an enormous period in nearly their present state.\nTo the naive view that natural selection spontaneously leads to complexification, Darwin opposes\na more neutral notion of evolutionary progress, according to which species simply adapt to their own\nparticular conditions. This may, or may not, lead to increases (or decreases) in complexity over time.\nIn other words, the flaw of the complexity-advantage assumption is that, while it rightly recognizes\nthe possible advantages of complexity, it fails to consider the possible advantages of simplicity. The\nworld is sufficiently complex that there are an almost infinite number of ways to \u2018\u2018earn a living,\u2019\u2019 and\non the whole, evolving lineages may just as readily gain advantage through simplicity as through\ncomplexity.5.2 Modern Endorsements of the Complexity-Advantage Assumption\nDespite Darwin\u2019s own objections, several authors have used the complexity-advantage assumption\nas an implicit justification for the idea that Darwinian evolution by natural selection entails a drive\ntoward complexity.5.2.1 Coevolution and Arms Races\nOne way in which evolution is sometimes said to favor the increase of complexity is through\ncoevolution between lineages that must adapt to each other\u2019s evolving features. This is expected to\nlead to an arms race [12], in which coevolving lineages should come up with more and more adaptive\nfeatures to defeat each other. The argument is summarized by Rosin and Belew [44]:330When the parasites evolve to overcome this failure [against the hosts], they create new\nchallenges for the hosts; the continuation of this may lead to an evolutionary \u2018\u2018arms race\u2019\u2019\n[10]. New genotypes arise to defeat old ones. New parasite types should serve as a drive\ntoward further innovation, creating ever-greater levels of complexity and performance\nby forcing hosts to respond to a wider range of more challenging parasite test cases.It is interesting that these authors, like several others, cite Dawkins as a source. Dawkins,\ncoauthor of the original arms-race hypothesis, has explicitly and emphatically denied that the prog-\nress brought about by arms races was intrinsically linked to complexification\u2014as we shall see in\nSection 5.4.\nBut at any rate, the problem with this position is easily identified: It implicitly assumes that the\nmost straightforward way to cope with an opponent\u2019s increase in complexity is a corresponding,\ncountering increase in complexity. In other words, complexity calls for complexity, because only\ncomplexity can cope with complexity. Unfortunately, as many practitioners of artificial coevolution\n(including Rosin and Belew themselves) have remarked [55, 17, 38], the opposite is often true:\nSimplicity is often quite efficient at dealing with complexity, with devastating effects. The most\nobvious example is the phenomenon of opportunism, or parasitism, whereby promising complex\norganisms are systematically defeated by simplistic opponents which successfully exploit some of\ntheir weak points (what Watson and Pollack call \u2018\u2018focusing on the wrong thing\u2019\u2019 [55]). We may also\nmention mediocre stable states [17] (also called \u2018\u2018collusion\u2019\u2019 [42] or \u2018\u2018immature inductions\u2019\u2019 [3]), whereArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconicompetitors remain stuck in a small, uninteresting section of the search space from which none has\nany incentive to budge\u2014the coevolutionary equivalent of a local optimum. As a special case of the\nlatter, we may mention the possibility of cycles [39], in which competitors cycle through a short,\npredictable sequence of simple behaviors without any long-term gain in general performance or\ncomplexity.3\nIn general, these problems can be summarized by this simple observation: Evolution is interested\nin immediate advantage, rather than in complexity or generality, and there seems to be no general\nrelationship between the two: To reliably obtain the latter, one must forcibly connect it to the former\nby means of algorithmic contrivance [39, 44, 50, 48, 38].\nTo be sure, there are many examples of specific situations where certain coevolutionary pressures\nhave clearly driven increases in complexity; some will be discussed in Section 6. What must be\ndoubted is not the existence of coevolution-driven increases in complexity, but that these should be a\ngeneral rule rather than interesting specific cases.5.2.2 A Cybernetic Argument for the Complexity Advantage\nHeylighen [25] uses a cybernetic argument to justify the complexity advantage assumption. In brief,\nnatural selection should favor organisms that are able to cope with a larger variety of perturbations;\nbut, by application of Ashby\u2019s law (Heylighen argues), this in turn requires higher countering variety\nin the behavior of these organisms, and thus more functional complexity:3 In\nArt[Ashby\u2019s law of requisite variety] states that in order to achieve control, the variety\nof actions a control system is able to execute must be at least as great as the variety\nof environmental perturbations that need to be compensated. The larger the variety of\navailable counteractions, the larger the set of disturbances that can be corrected, and the\nlarger the domain of potential environmental situations in which the control system can\nsurvive. All other things being equal, greater control variety implies greater fitness. . . .\nTherefore, evolution through natural selection will tend to increase control, and thus,\nbecause of Ashby\u2019s law, internal variety. This can be interpreted as a functional\ndifferentiation, i.e., the appearance of more diverse activities or functions. . . .All other things being equal, a system that can survive situations A, B, and C, is absolutely fitter\nthan a system that can only survive A and B. Such an increase in absolute fitness is necessarily\naccompanied by an increase in functional complexity. Thus, evolution will tend to irreversibly\nproduce increases of functional complexity.\nThis leads to interesting questions. For example, by any measure of organismal complexity,\nbeetles are arguably less complex than chimpanzees. Yet there do not seem to be many \u2018\u2018situations\u2019\u2019\nthat could be survived by chimpanzees, but not by beetles\u2014as opposed to the other way round.\nMore generally, it is not immediately clear that more complex individuals can cope with more\nenvironments than simpler individuals.\nQuite possibly, the crucial difficulty in this argument is that Ashby\u2019s law applies when one needs\nto actively counter certain variations in order to homeostatically control certain variables; but in\nnature, adapting to a change in an external variable does not necessarily entail countering this change.\nEvolving lineages may well cut their dependency on certain variables (as in previously carnivorous\nlineages turning into herbivores), or simply ignore the variation in question. To use Heylighen\u2019s own\nexample of warm-bloodedness, we note that birds and mammals are the only surviving lineages of\nwarm-blooded animals: Insects, whose range, diversity, and total biomass vastly exceed that of either\nmammals or birds, have hardly suffered from their lack of internal temperature control mechanisms.terestingly, examples of such coevolutionary cycles have actually been reported in nature [49].\nificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 331\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiIf nature is any guide, surviving more \u2018\u2018situations\u2019\u2019 can be obtained by simplicity just as readily as by\ncomplexity, which contradicts the premise of the argument.4\nTo summarize, it seems that the cybernetic argument, like the arms race argument, attributes a\ngeneral advantage to complexity by disregarding the potential advantages of simplicity: It essentially\nassumes that only complexity (in the evolving lineage) can deal with complexity (in the environment).\n5.3 Cope\u2019s Rule and the Size-Complexity Insight\nBonner [6] has proposed a way in which natural selection might indirectly drive an increase in the\nmaximum of complexity. The basis of this argument is Cope\u2019s rule, that is, the generalization that\nthere is a tendency for lineages to grow in size over time. Bonner provides a justification for this rule\nby pointing out that \u2018\u2018there is always room at the top\u2019\u2019: \u2018\u2018by becoming larger the organisms enter new\nsize worlds where, among other things, they avoid predation and competition.\u2019\u2019 Bonner also notices\nthat size is (very roughly) correlated with complexity: On the whole, larger organisms tend to be\nmore complex. Bonner takes the practical approach of defining complexity as the number of cell\ntypes in an organism.\nBonner argues that the relationship between size and complexity is explained by considerations of\nengineering and efficiency: Creating and maintaining a larger body is likely to require higher division\nof labor. Thus, a selective drive for size creates an indirect selective drive towards complexity, though\nBonner is very clear that this is only one component among many of selective action on complexity\n(p. 221). The book repeatedly points out that this selection-driven increase in size and complexity\nonly applies at maximum values: Intermediate forms have certainly been maintained, and \u2018\u2018every\nbiological community on the globe today contains a complete spectrum from the smallest to the\nlargest organism\u2019\u2019 (p. 221). In addition Bonner emphasizes that selection for increase and decrease in\nsize and complexity have occurred concomitantly throughout evolution.\nThis argument is not without difficulties. First, it relies on Cope\u2019s rule, which is itself the subject\nof recurrent controversy within evolutionary research [26, 2, 22]. But more generally, the argument\ndoes not seem to provide any compelling evidence to show that the observed trend is indeed driven\n(biased), rather than passive (diffusive). In fact, the very possibility of a passive trend is simply not\nconsidered at all. It should be pointed out that the book was written before McShea and Gould\nbegan to draw attention to the question of trend mechanisms. Because the possibility of a passive\ntrend is not considered, the increase in maximum value is seen as requiring an explanation, a causa-\ntive force, which happens to be the \u2018\u2018room at the top\u2019\u2019 principle.5\nIn fact, with hindsight, the wealth of data and evidence provided by Bonner appears to be not\nonly compatible with, but strikingly suggestive of, a passive trend. This applies particularly to an-\ncestry data taken from the fossil record (such as Figures 8 and 9 in the book), which do not seem to\nshow any pervasive upward bias, but rather an apparently undirected branching process constrained\nby a lower bound. Also, Gingerich\u2019s evidence [21, 20], which Bonner discusses several times (in-\ncluding in the passage quoted above), is suggestive of a passive trend: When no pervasive bias exists,\nbut rather species evolve both up and down indifferently along the scale and the sole constraint is a\nlocal boundary, we may expect that the overall rate of change will decrease as we average it over\nlonger periods.6\n5.4 Expert Opinion Against the Complexity-Advantage Assumption\nMore generally, theoretical justifications of a complexity advantage face a difficulty: The variety of\nenvironments (both biotic and abiotic) faced by evolving lineages, as well as their remarkable4 The author extends the cybernetic argument to coevolutionary situations and arms races, which can be answered in a similar manner:\nAdapting to an \u2018\u2018increase in variety\u2019\u2019 in a competing species does not entail matching this variety. Adaptation is simply not a problem of\ncontrol in Ashby\u2019s sense.\n5 Incidentally, this may show that Gould\u2019s and McShea\u2019s argument is not quite as obvious or routine as it may have seemed to some [11].\n6 This interpretation of Gingerich\u2019s data now seems consensual: See Weiner [56], quoted in pp. 106\u2013109 of [7]. Valentine and colleagues\n[53] provide refined data on the increase of cell types among metazoans, and model this increase with a passive system.\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3332\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconiplasticity, implies that at any time there is a very wide range of ways to \u2018\u2018earn a living\u2019\u2019 in nature.\nOptimizing the efficiency of a population in its chosenway of life (or, if the opportunity arises, switching\ntrades altogether) is what Darwinian evolution does. There does not seem to be any compelling reason\nwhy the majority of natural lifestyles should benefit from continuous increases in complexity.\nThis point has been admirably expressed by Dawkins, in an unduly overlooked piece [11] from\nwhich we will now quote at length:ArtWhy should any thoughtful Darwinian have expected a majority of lineages to increase\nin anatomical complexity? Certainly it is not clear that anybody inspired by adaptationist\nphilosophy would . . . . Our human line happens to have specialised in complexity, especially\nof the nervous system, so it is only human that we should define progress as an increase in\ncomplexity or in braininess. Other species will see it differently, as Julian Huxley. . . pointed\nout in a piece of doggerel entitled \u2018\u2018Progress\u2019\u2019:\u2014\nThe Crab to Cancer junior gave advice:\nKnow what you want, my son, and then proceed\nDirectly sideways. God has thus decreed\nProgress is lateral; let that suffice.\nDarwinian Tapeworms on the other hand\nAgree that Progress is a loss of brain,\nAnd all that makes it hard for worms to attain\nThe true Nirvana peptic, pure and grand.\nMan too enjoys to omphaloscopize.\nHimself as Navel of the Universe . . .. . .

Learned elephants, to borrow a\npleasantry from Steven Pinker . . . , would ruefully fail to uphold the comforting notion that\nprogress, defined as a driven elongation of the nose, is manifested by a statistical majority\nof animal lineages.In this quotation, the opinions of three authors (all of them well-known evolutionists, all of them\nstaunch supporters of the power of natural selection) are cited. It is interesting that this passage is\ntaken from a review of Gould\u2019s own book on the subject of progress [24], which on the question of\ncomplexity adopts pretty much the same position. In the beginning of this section we showed that\nDarwin had already expressed very similar feelings. Let us also cite Maynard Smith and Szathma\u00b4ry,\nwho unambiguously reject the notion that evolution should be biased towards complexity in the first\nchapters of their book [32] (this chapter carries the rather explicit title \u2018\u2018The fallacy of progress\u2019\u2019).\nSimilarly we may quote Mayr [33]:Among all the forms of life, neither the prokaryotes nor protists, fungi or plants has\nevolved smartness, as it should have if it were \u2018\u2018better.\u2019\u2019 In the 28 plus phyla of animals,\nintelligence evolved in only one (chordates) and doubtfully also in the cephalopods.\nAnd in the thousands of subdivisions of the chordates, high intelligence developed\nin only one, the primates, and even there only in one small subdivision. So much for\nthe putative inevitability of the development of high intelligence because \u2018\u2018it is better\nto be smart.\u2019\u2019ificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 333\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiAll in all, we note that there is much expert opinion against the idea that natural selection should\ndrive a pervasive trend towards increasing functional or behavioral complexity in evolution. Rather,\nthe consensus seems to point towards Darwin\u2019s original conception of evolution by natural selection:\na recklessly opportunistic process, which will constantly exploit any possible way to make a living,\nindependently of whether it leads to increases or decreases in complexity.6 The Evidence: Complexity in Evolution\n6.1 The Enduring Dominance of Simple Life Forms\nA significant argument against the idea of an active, pervasive, selection-driven bias towards\ncomplexity growth over the course of evolution is that simpler life forms still dominate the planet.\nIn a typically engaging section, Gould [24] famously argued that \u2018\u2018on any possible, reasonable or fair\ncriterion, bacteria are\u2014and always have been\u2014the dominant forms of life on Earth.\u2019\u2019 Prokaryotes\n(Bacteria and Archaea) are more ancient, more numerous, and more diverse, have conquered more\nenvironments, and apparently compose vastly more of the cellular biomass than all other living\nentities combined (a position only reinforced by later estimates [57]). Simpler prokaryotes have\nclearly not been displaced by their more complex eukaryotic cousins.\nWe note that it is possible to extend this pattern to other taxonomic levels. The most functionally\ncomplex animals, besides humans, are arguably great apes\u2014of which, it turns out, many happen\nto be on the verge of extinction. We may compare this with the success (whether in numbers, range,\nor conservation prospects) of \u2018\u2018lesser\u2019\u20197 simians, especially the genus of macaques, the most wide-\nspread of all primate genera. Nonhuman primates in general are significantly less successful, by any\nmeasure of success, than the placid artiodactyls (ruminants, pigs, etc.). Chordates (the phylum that\nincludes vertebrates) are vastly exceeded in number, diversity, and total biomass by arthropods, the\ntruly dominant form of metazoan life [5]. Land animals in general are simply overwhelmed by land\nplants in terms of total biomass. The dominance of prokaryotes, Gould\u2019s \u2018\u2018modal bacter,\u2019\u2019 merely\ncrowns what appears to be a general pattern, or rather the absence of a pattern: At any given\ntaxonomic level, more functionally complex entities are simply not more successful than their sim-\npler counterparts. In fact, a lot could be said for the opposite position, though of course counter-\nexamples abound.\nThe important fact here is not the enduring existence of some primitive life forms, per se. What is\nsignificant is that at almost any given scale, and for any subtree of the Tree of Life, we observe that\nsimpler organisms not only endure, but often seem to dominate the more complex organisms. This\nleads to the following question: If evolution is indeed generally biased towards complexity, then why\ndo only a minority of life forms become more complex? Why did all those simple forms fail to feel\nthe supposed pull of the complexity drive? This pattern would suggest that those taxa that did reach\nhigh complexity did so because of certain particular, specific selective pressures, to which they\nsomehow adapted by increasing their complexity.6.2 Examples of Particular Selection-Driven Trends Towards Complexity\nConsidering the amount of confusion that has been pointed out by McShea, Gould, Dawkins, and\nothers, it may not be entirely futile to stress the obvious: Nobody denies that in many cases, active,\nselection-driven increases in complexity do in fact occur. Complex adaptations often do confer a\ndefinite selective advantage over relatives that do not possess them. The result is that they will\nmechanically propagate throughout the population. Such trends have happened at all levels, ranging\nfrom individual subspecies to the entire biosphere, both within and across lineages. We will only give\na few examples, which we believe are of particular interest.7 Quantitative measures of behavioral complexity and neocortex development among primates are given by Dunbar [14].\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3334\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiFor a specific example, we need look no further than the evolution of our own species,\nHomo sapiens [7, 29]. Modern humans are the latest stage in a sequence of various groups, starting\nwith the early australopithecines (essentially bipedal apes), going through the early Homo branch (the\nhabilis group: H. rudolfensis, H. habilis, etc.), the erectus group (H. ergaster, H. erectus, etc.), the archaic\nHomo sapiens (H. Heidelbergensis, H. Neanderthalensis), and eventually modern humans, presumably\ndescended from the same branch as H. Heidelbergensis (in parallel with the Neanderthal derivation).\nNow this sequence shows two notable features. First, each new group showed demonstrably more\ncomplex behavior than its predecessors, as can be deduced from artifacts. A trend of increase in\nbrain size is also apparent (especially in certain stages, such as the erectus and sapiens groups [29]).\nSecond, at a sufficiently large scale, these groups tended to thrive while their predecessors were\ndisplaced. It is therefore reasonable to argue that this sequence constitutes a trend, driven by natural\nselection, whereby increasingly complex groups successively displace their predecessors. Is it possible\nthat the specific case of human evolution, in which natural selection did drive a sequential increase in\ncomplexity, influenced our view of evolution in general?\nHowever, even in this most indisputable of trends, it is important to exert caution. First of all,\nthe appearance of early Homo certainly did not displace the australopithecines. On the contrary,\naustralopithecines continued to expand and radiate, with a trend towards robust forms (A. boisei, A.\nrobustus), for at least another million years [19]. The divergence somewhere along the line of the early\nHomo branch (the habilis group) was apparently a \u2018\u2018much more isolated and insignificant trend\u2019\u2019 [29,\np. 328], which locally reversed the general tendency. Only with the erectus group did Homo finally\nachieve prominence. Furthermore, it is not absolutely clear that the displacement of each group by\nits successor was invariably caused by the latter\u2019s higher complexity: Climate changes have clearly had\nan influence on the evolution [28] (and apparently the extinction [18]) of various human lineages.\nThus, even in the clearly driven trend of human complexification, the pluralism of evolution shows\nits signs.\nMore generally, the evolution of complex organs constitutes a remarkable, ubiquitous example\nof selection-driven increase in complexity. Historically, the paradigm of complex organ evolution is\nthe eye, a high feat of engineering that has been discovered many times in the course of evolution.\nDawkins [10] has famously described the highly complex sonar of certain bats, using it as a re-\nplacement for the often-used vertebrate eye as an example of complex organ evolution. The evo-\nlution of such complex organs, each composed of several highly heterogeneous, interdependent parts\ndelicately assembled to obtain a certain result (and thus functionally complex according to our def-\ninition), has necessarily involved a long sequence of gradual increases in complexity, each of them\npreserved by selection. In the case of the eye, many of these intermediate stages have actually been\nfound in living species [43, Figure 13.2]. Of course, we should keep in mind that many creatures\n(perhaps most impressively ants) do very well with low-fidelity eyes.\nThe massively enlarged primate brain must of necessity be the result of a selection-driven trend;\nthis is because primate brains are costly structures, especially in terms of energy. As Dunbar [14]\nexplains, \u2018\u2018because the cost of maintaining a large brain is so great, it is intrinsically unlikely that large\nbrains will evolve just because they can.\u2019\u2019 Dunbar provides a wealth of evidence that indicates that\nthe relative size of the neocortex in primates (including humans) correlates remarkably with mea-\nsures of social behavior (such as the size of the social group), but not with ecological aspects such\nas diet, foraging behavior, or range size. This would suggest that social pressures, rather than eco-\nlogical factors, were the proximal drive for larger neocortices in primates\u2014a clear example of a\ncoevolution-driven complexity increase.\nThe evolution of complex chemical cycles within cells may be seen as a counterpart (and pre-\ndecessor) to the evolution of complex organs in multicellular organisms. Perhaps the most re-\nmarkable case is aerobic respiration, an intricate oxygen-based cycle that extracts energy from\ncomplex organic molecules. This highly efficient process, yielding up to 36 ATP molecules for each\nglucose molecule (against two for anaerobic fermentation), is now extremely widespread among living\ncreatures: Exclusively anaerobic creatures, once dominant, have been relegated to a secondary role\n(though by no means eliminated altogether) by creatures endowed with the more complex, but moreArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 335\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconipowerful aerobic respiration apparatus.8 Of course, anaerobic fermentation is still present as a\ncomponent of the aerobic respiratory cycle, to the effect that aerobic cells may revert to anaerobic\nfermentation in the absence of oxygen (much to the satisfaction of certain higher mammals not\nentirely averse to the effects of fermented beverages).\nMore generally, it is widely acknowledged that the general architecture of modern living systems\n(based on nucleic acids and proteins) is too complex to have arisen spontaneously, in its present\nform, from abiotic reactions. Therefore, intermediate forms (now extinct) must have preceded the\nappearance of modern life. The utter elimination of these early systems, which we may surmise to\nhave been quite varied, can hardly be explained by pure contingency. In fact, it is reasonable to posit\nthat these ur-organisms were actually displaced by modern life, which simply proved more efficient\nin assimilating precious carbon atoms and free energy. From this viewpoint, the total domination\nof modern life can be seen as a selection-driven trend, through which a sequence of increasingly\ncomplex systems successively displaced their simpler, less efficient ancestors.9 This process, however,\nhas not endured into the evolution of modern life, as can be shown by the massive dominance of\nprokaryotic forms in the present biosphere.\n6.3 Examples of Particular Selection-Driven Decreases in Complexity\nHaving shown particular examples of driven trends towards complexity, we feel obliged to empha-\nsize that trends often run in the other direction as well.\nOne obvious form of selection towards lower complexity is the emergence of parasitism in\npreviously free-living species: An organism that was originally able to survive on its own finds itself\ndependent on its host. This often leads to a reduction in complexity, as Gould [24, p. 220] predict-\nably observes.10 This phenomenon is well known and does not require further emphasis.\nAnother common source of selectively driven decrease in complexity is miniaturization. Bonner\n[6], pursuing his argument that size and complexity often go hand in hand, mentions the case of\ndwarf rotifers, which, because of new biomechanical constraints imposed by their nanism, replace\ntheir gut system with a continuous cytoplasm nested with small food-carrying vacuoles. The result is\na decrease both in structure differentiation and in number of cell types. A well-known example of\nminiaturization (and associated loss of complexity) is that of Acari, particularly among the most\nminute mites. For example, dust mites have shed off much of their digestive structure (including\ntheir stomach), and as a result must ingest the same piece of food several times and use external\ndigestion.\nMore generally, in parallel with the constant elaboration of complex organs, an equally constant\nprocess of complexity reduction occurs in nature. We need only cite a few well-known examples. The\nmost obvious telltales of evolutionary simplification are vestigial structures. The vermiform appendix\nin humans is the remnant of a structure that allows its bearer to digest cellulose in plants, something\nthat humans cannot do: This is clearly a diminution in functional complexity, by any measure. The\nsmall pink pouch in the inner corner of our eyes is the nonfunctional remnant of the nictitating\nmembrane (the \u2018\u2018third eyelid\u2019\u2019) found in many other animals, including cats and dogs. Modern whales\nretain small, undifferentiated bone structures as a memory of what used to be a perfectly functional\npelvis and hind legs [51]. This also affects the paradigmatic eye: In many creatures that have reverted\nto dark environments, the functional complexity of their visual systems has decayed into\nnonfunctionality, sometimes culminating in the complete elimination of the eye itself (the cavefish\nAstyanax is interesting in that various stages of eye loss can be observed in distinct modern8 Even then, things are not quite clear-cut: The fermenters\u2019 higher rate of consumption may actually allow them to overcome respirators\nin certain situation of direct topical competition [41].\n9 In fact, Fernando and Rowe [16] suggest that the very origin of life itself is the result of such a selection-driven trend towards increasing\ncomplexity, initiated by natural selection among prebiotic autocatalytic systems.\n10 However, Gould also reminds us that in many case, parasites may also exhibit high complexity at some stages of their life: Sacullina is\nmentioned as an example both of extreme simplicity (in its almost amorphous host-bound form) and complexity (in its remarkably\nintricate development cycle).\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3336\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconipopulations [27]). Even the pinnacle of animal complexity, the vertebrate brain, has undergone\nsignificant morphological and functional simplification in certain lineages: Let us mention salaman-\nders [46] and certain bats [47].11\nFinally, we will mention a rather spectacular form of successful complexity decrease. This\nexample, tentatively suggested for this purpose by McShea [36] (and recently confirmed by further\nstudies [13]), concerns the appearance of infectious tumor cells. In at least two separate examples\n(one affecting dogs in a rather benign way, the other affecting Tasmanian devils with a usually fatal\noutcome), it has been found that a certain lineage of tumor cells could be transmitted from host to\nhost through contact, with the result that the tumors effectively behaved as populations of single-cell\nparasites of the host species. In both cases, the tumor cells were shown to share a common origin\n(being genetically similar to each other across hosts, and different from their hosts), and thus can be\nconsidered a distinct species. For our purpose, the key point is that these single-cell species originated\nfrom mutated cells within multicellular, \u2018\u2018higher\u2019\u2019 organisms. In other words, in at least two separate\noccurrences, a major transition of evolution [32] (namely, the invention of multicellularity) was suc-\ncessfully reversed. This dramatic drop in complexity from highly complex mammals to single-cell\norganisms created new, simpler, yet successful species, especially in the case of the dog tumor lineage,\nwhich is thought to be at least several centuries old.\n7 Conclusion: The Passive Trend of Complexity Growth in Evolution\n7.1 Passive Growth of Complexity\nIn summary, both theory and evidence suggest the same interpretation: There has been a trend of\nincrease in the maximum of complexity in evolution, and this trend seems to have been resolutely\npassive\u2014that is, globally unbiased. At all scales, individual lineages will be driven to whatever form\nof adaptation evolution may encounter, which may or may not lead to increases, or decreases, in\ncomplexity. There does not seem to be any overarching bias, either in evidence or in theory, that\nwould drive a majority of lineages towards higher complexity. The Tree of Life does not \u2018\u2018seek\u2019\u2019\ncomplexity as actual plants seek sunlight.\nAgain, it is important to note that this does not contradict the hypothesis of an arrow of\ncomplexity; it does, however, contradict certain interpretations, namely those that surmise a built-in\ntendency for Darwinian evolution to drive lineages towards increasing complexity. This does not\nimply a rejection of the existence of a trend: A passive trend is still a trend.\n7.2 Nontriviality of Passive Trends\nIn addition, we must stress that a passive trend does not in any way imply that Darwinian evolution\nis neutral or irrelevant to complexity growth. There is a tendency to see passive trends as somehow\ntrivial, or not requiring any particular explanation. That this is not the case is of fundamental\nimportance. Complexity has indeed risen to extraordinary levels, and the ease with which nature\ncomes up with complex forms demands explanation.\nThe difficulty of obtaining a sustained arrow of complexity is amply demonstrated by the field of\nartificial evolution, in which thorough use of Darwinian evolution has indeed created appreciable\nlevels of complexity [48, 30], but nothing that could even be compared to the enormous growth of\ncomplexity in nature. In fact, the difficulty of initiating open-ended evolution in artificial experiments\nis widely noted [31]. Consequently, the very fact that evolution seems unbiased towards higher or\nlower complexity is in itself worthy of note, because in artificial settings the process seems very much\nbiased against continuing complexity growth. The apparent absence of a bias for or against complex-\nity in nature only seems trivial if we forget how strong the bias against complexity seems to be in\ncomputers.11 Brain evolution in vertebrates is a complicated business, despite a highly conserved general structure. Many fishes have similar brain\nsize to mammals and birds, relative to their body size. Many independent increases in brain size have been identified, but stability and\ndecreases have also occurred [40].\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 337\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconi7.3 New Questions\nThis casts a new light on our problem. If a passive trend has occurred in the evolution of complexity,\nthe question then becomes: What makes such a trend possible? What conditions are necessary for the\nappearance and sustained increase of complexity (that is, for the emergence of an arrow of com-\nplexity) in a system? What is the role of the Darwinian mechanism in this emergence? This is the\nsecond part of our reformulated question (as put forth in Section 4), with which the remaining sec-\ntions of this article will be concerned.8 The Role of Darwinian Evolution in Complexity Growth\n8.1 Systems, Designs, and Complexity\nIn this section we want to evaluate the effects of Darwinian evolution on complexity, in the most ab-\nstract, general sense. Our perspective is unabashedly conceptual: We want to gain insight into the rela-\ntionship between evolution and complexity, rather than devise technical methods to be used in actual\nexperiments. To do this, we ask which constraints on complexity exist in abstract nonevolutionary gen-\nerative systems; then we ask how the introduction of an evolutionary mechanism alters these constraints.\nLet us consider an abstract generative system, of which we only know two things:\u0001 A certain design generator is being used to generate new designs; the particulars of the design\ngenerator define a certain space of possible designs, which can be explored.\n\u0001 New designs are being generated according to a certain heuristic; in other words, the space\nof available designs is being sampled in a certain sequence, as specified by the heuristic.For now, we assume that the heuristic used to generate new designs is unknown: It could be\nrandom, evolutionary, hill-climbing, or anything else. We now ask the question: What is necessary for\nsuch a system to produce unbounded growth in functional complexity?\nA moment\u2019s thought suggests that in principle, at least two (rather obvious) conditions are\nabsolutely necessary. First, the system generator must in principle be able to generate arbitrarily\ncomplex designs. Second, the search heuristic must not impose a hard upper bound on adaptivity or\nfunctional complexity of the designs being sampled. It need not favor complexity\u2014it may even\ndiscriminate against it, but not to the point of forbidding it entirely above a certain level. Provided\nthese two conditions are met, over time the system should mechanically produce arbitrarily complex\ndesigns, regardless of which heuristic is being used.\n8.2 Limitations of Nonevolutionary Complexity Growth\n8.2.1 Inefficiency\nHowever, another moment\u2019s thought will make it clear that, without any further device, such a system\nmight well take impossibly long times to come up with any such complexity. This is because, as we have\nseen in Section 2.2, functionally complex designs are rare in the space of all possible designs. A random\ndesign generator may come up with arbitrarily complex designs, given enough time, but what good\nwould that be if \u2018\u2018enough time\u2019\u2019 exceeds the thermodynamic limit of universal heat death?\n8.2.2 Finite Populations and Finite Lifetimes\nAnother difficulty occurs when designs are eventually removed from the system. For example, designs\nmight have a specified maximum lifetime (which would mean that all designs are eventually eliminated),\nor the population could have a maximum size (which implies that some designs must be eliminated).\nIn this case, while the system will still come up with designs of unbounded functional complexity\nover time, we have no assurance that the maximum of complexity at any time will sustainedly increase.\nThis is because, without any further assumption, we have no way to know that the rate at whichArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3338\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconicomplex designs are being generated balances the rate at which they will be removed: In fact, the\nopposite is much more likely. While arbitrarily complex designs will eventually occur, these designs\nmay very well be mere blips in an otherwise consistently low background: If the current maximum of\ncomplexity is removed, we have no assurance that it will be replaced by designs of similar complexity.\nAgain, this is because functionally complex designs are rare within the space of all possible designs.\nThe consequence is that, barring further assumptions, the population may well spend most of its\ntime at a very low level of functional complexity.\n8.2.3 Consequence: No Arrow of Complexity\nWe must therefore conclude that, while the two obvious requirements expressed above are sufficient\nto generate arbitrary complexity over (much) time, they are not sufficient to create what we would\ncall an arrow of complexity. This would imply a sustained, noticeable increase in the maximum com-\nplexity, rather than the highly occasional appearance of fleeting, isolated complexity spikes.8.3 Effect of Evolution on Complexity\n8.3.1 The Darwinian Heuristic\nNow let us introduce a new requirement: We posit that our system is evolutionary, that is, it follows\nthe Darwinian heuristic as elegantly formulated by Wagner and Altenberg [54]: \u2018\u2018the Darwinian\nheuristic is to choose sample points by perturbing the more fit ones among those sampled thus far.\u2019\u2019\nIn other words, new designs are not generated arbitrarily: Rather, existing designs are evaluated after\na certain metric (their fitness), and those designs that exhibit a relatively high fitness are selected as\nstarting points for small jumps towards newer designs. Our question is: How does this new spec-\nification affect the emergence of functional complexity?\n8.3.2 The Darwinian Mechanism Restricts Exploration\nThe first thing to note is that the Darwinian heuristic actually imposes a restriction on the search\nprocess: The search process will now follow certain directions at the expense of others. This re-\nstriction constrains both the scope and the direction of the search process. The restriction in scope\ncomes from the fact that, because evolution proceeds by small jumps from existing designs, newer\ndesigns can only be chosen in the neighborhood of the current population. The restriction in\ndirection comes from the fact that only those designs that exhibit a high fitness will be used as\nstarting points for further exploration.\nIn unfavorable conditions, this restriction may severely limit the exploration of design space. For\nexample, if the population happens to be in a certain domain of the search space, which is entirely\nsurrounded by relatively unsuccessful designs, then the process may well end up being trapped in\nthat domain. Conversely, potentially highly fit designs may never be reached if they are surrounded\nby a region of unfit designs. This suggests at least two conditions for complexity to appear in evo-\nlutionary systems, namely, that it should be successful and reachable.12\n8.3.3 Benefits of the Restriction\nOn the other hand, this restriction has important potential benefits. First of all, when successful designs\nare found, they will tend to be preserved, even beyond the lifetime of individuals\u2014or, at the very least,\nthey will stand an immensely higher chance of being preserved than under random search, as long as\nthey remain successful within the context of the current population. This permits the persistence of\nfunctional complexity, despite its rarity in design space, even in the face of finite lifetimes: Complexity is\nno longer condemned to occur only in short blips over an otherwise simple background.12 In the context of this discussion, a design is successful if its fitness is high enough, relative to the current population, to be used as a\nstarting point for further samples. A point in design space is reachable if certain successful designs within the current population might be\naltered into the corresponding design.\nArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 339\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiFurthermore, as we have already noted in Section 2.2, adaptive functional complexity tends to\ncome in loose clusters in design space: If we want to obtain a successful complex design, we stand a\nmuch higher chance to obtain it by slightly altering another successful design of lower complexity\nthan by randomly poking at the entire design space. The consequence is that, by preserving existing\n(successful) complexity, the Darwinian heuristic also facilitates further increases in complexity, pro-\nvided such increases are possible within the neighborhood of the population: A successful complex\ndesign may act as a stepping stone towards even higher complexity. This is, in essence, the basis of the\nblind watchmaker mechanism, so vividly expounded by Dawkins [10]: By slowly accumulating small\nbeneficial improvements, each working as a stepping stone towards the next, the Darwinian heuristic\nmay eventually produce enormous amounts of adaptive functional complexity, with incomparably\nhigher probability than under random search.\nThus we see that certain requirements must hold if evolution is to generate designs of unbounded\ncomplexity: It is necessary that, at all times, successful designs of higher complexity exist within\nthe current neighborhood of the population. At first sight, these conditions might seem rather\nstraightforward. However, are they really sufficient?8.3.4 Enter the Red Queen: Variable Fitness and Complexity\nSo far we have not considered a certain aspect of fitness, namely the fact that it is not necessarily\nstable over time. A design that is successful at a certain time may later prove unsuccessful if con-\nditions have changed. This is particularly the case in situations of coevolution, that is, when the\nfitness of a given design depends at least in part on the features of other existing designs within the\npopulation. In this case, species evolve constantly in order to adapt to each other\u2019s evolution\u2014and\nthose that fail to do so disappear. This is the well-known Red Queen effect [52, 8].\nFor our purposes, the basic consequence is that even if all previously mentioned conditions\nare met, an evolutionary process may still fail to produce a sustained increase in complexity. Even\nif, at any time, there exists potentially successful complex designs in the reachable neighborhood\nof the current population, complexity will not necessarily grow over time. This may seem counter-\nintuitive: At first sight, if at any time successful complex designs exist within the reachable neigh-\nborhood, then we would expect that eventually evolution would find them, and thus complexity\nwould grow.\nThe reason why fitness instability may prevent such continuous growth is that it may disrupt the\nstepping-stones effect on which this growth relies. If fitness is variable, then designs of intermediate\ncomplexity may become unsuccessful before they have a chance to be altered into more complex\ndesigns, putting the latter beyond reach of the process. Thus, despite the constant presence of\nreachable, successful designs of higher complexity, no continuous process of complexification may\noccur. If moderately complex designs are not sufficiently robust to serve as stepping stones towards\nhigher complexity, the blind watchmaker fumbles, and the arrow of complexity is broken. The effects\nof this phenomenon in artificial coevolution have been mentioned in Section 5.2.1.\nThus we see that for complexity to appear in an evolutionary system, it not only needs to be\nsuccessful and reachable: It also needs to be robust, even in the face of possible instabilities (including\nnew competitors, parasites, etc.)\u2014at least sufficiently so to provide a stepping stone for further\ncomplexity growth. This is an additional requirement that, if not observed, may actually prevent the\nrise of complexity in evolutionary systems.8.3.5 Putting It All Together\nHow can we express these requirements as concisely as possible? We suggest the following\nformulation:\u0001 At any time, there are more possible jumps towards successful designs of higher and equal\ncomplexity than towards designs that would make the starting points of these jumps\nunsuccessful.Artificial Life Volume 14, Number 3340\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. MiconiHere \u2018\u2018higher and equal complexity\u2019\u2019 is to be understood in comparison with the current\nmaximum of the population. A jump is the creation of a new design, using an already existing design\n(the starting point of the jump) as a parent. Clearly, by definition, the starting point of a jump must be\nsuccessful.\nThis condition is clearly statistical: Even if such jumps exist and constitute the majority of pos-\nsible jumps, we have no guarantee that they will be taken in the next step, so the corresponding\ncomplexity increase may not occur immediately. Conversely, even if jumps towards higher complexity\nare rare, we may still occasionally encounter one of them. What this condition determines, however,\nis the presence or absence of a trend\u2014that is, a long-term tendency. If this condition does not hold\nover time, then statistically we do not expect any long-term trend towards higher complexity to\nemerge; similarly, if it does hold consistently, then a long-term trend towards higher complexity is\nstatistically expected.\nMore importantly, this condition is very much local (both in time and in design space). If the\ncondition holds at a certain time, that does not mean in any way that it will keep doing so in the future:\nAny new jump runs the risk of breaking the condition. For example, one particularly unlucky jump\nmight discover a niche of devastatingly efficient simple individuals (in the extreme, we might conjure\nimages of \u2018\u2018gray goo\u2019\u2019 bacteria). Should this happen, then the probability of jumps might become highly\nbiased towards these simple individuals, and thus the condition would not hold any more. Conversely,\nwhen the condition does not hold, one particularly lucky jump may stumble upon a new area of robust\ncomplex adaptations, making the condition valid. Therefore, maximum complexity will tend to increase\nas long as the condition is consistently met\u2014but only that long. Complexity will not tend to increase\n(or may even tend to decrease) if the condition consistently fails to hold.8.4 Evolution and Complexity: A Double-Edged Sword\nIn summary, we suggest that the conditions under which Darwinian evolution will generate a\nsustained trend of increase in the maximum of complexity (that is, an arrow of complexity) can be\nsummarized as concisely as possible in the following manner:\n1. Arbitrarily complex adaptive designs must exist in the design space explorable by the\ndesign generator.\n2. The search heuristic must not impose a hard upper bound on the functional complexity\nof designs.\n3. At any time, there must be more possible jumps towards successful designs of higher\nand equal complexity, than towards designs that would make the starting points of\nthese jumps unsuccessful.\nThus we see that there is a deep ambiguity in the relationship between evolution and complexity.\nThis ambiguity is captured in the third requirement above, which (as we saw) is very much specific to\nDarwinian evolution. Random search, for example, may create arbitrary amounts of complexity over\n(much) time, even if this requirement does not hold, while Darwinian evolution cannot. But if (and\nas long as) this requirement holds, then Darwinian evolution can actually create an arrow of\ncomplexity (a sustained, noticeable trend of increase in maximum complexity), which is utterly\nbeyond the reach of random search. In this sense, with regard to complexity, Darwinian evolution is\nvery much a double-edged sword.9 Conclusion\nClearly, at this point, we have gone a long way to clarify the statement that open-ended evolutionary\nprocesses have an inherent, lawlike tendency to create creatures with increasingly complicatedArtificial Life Volume 14, Number 3 341\nEvolution and Complexity: The Double-Edged SwordT. Miconifunctional organization. We have seen that the hypothesis of an arrow of complexity can be inter-\npreted in several ways, with different support for each interpretation. It was shown that the unde-\nniable increase of maximum complexity in evolution is best explained as a passive (unbiased) trend,\nthat is, a side consequence of an otherwise complexity-neutral process of reckless local adaptation.\nWe have also seen that Darwinian evolution is capable of creating an arrow of complexity (that is,\na sustained, noticeable trend of increase in maximum complexity) that could not exist without it,\nprovided certain requirements hold. These requirements are that at any time, higher complexity\nshould be reachable, successful, and reasonably robust, in the sense made explicit by our for-\nmulation. They result from the restrictions imposed by the Darwinian heuristic on the exploration of\nsearch space. As long as these evolution-specific requirements are consistently met, then evolution\nwill keep producing designs of increasing adaptive complexity in a sustained manner. But if they\ncease to be, then evolution will not only fail to produce an arrow of complexity\u2014it may actually\nprevent complexity increases altogether. In other words, with regard to complexity growth, evolution\nis a double-edged sword, which may slash both ways.\nThus the appearance and growth of complexity in evolution results neither from a built-in, re-\nlentless march to \u2018\u2018progress,\u2019\u2019 nor from the miraculous conjunction of a series of vastly improbable\ncoincidences. Rather, it is simply ascribable to the presence of certain objective conditions, applying\nto the capacities of the design generator and the structure of design space. No grand scheme of\ncosmological destiny, no poignant tale of triumph against all odds; just the pedestrian, plainly logical,\nyet amazingly powerful consequence of the properties of modern life in the face of the challenges\nand opportunities posed by the laws of physics, the geological environment\u2014and itself.References\n1.
