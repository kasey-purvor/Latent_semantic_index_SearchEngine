(Sci. Tot Env. 348:51-72) have examined heavy metal exposure of 16 \nhumans in the Cartagena region using analysis of archaeological bones.  An analysis of the 17 \nlead and iron levels they report shows that they are physiologically implausible and must 18 \ntherefore result from diagenesis.  This, and analogy with the known diagenetic origin of 19 \ncertain other elements, suggests that the other metal analyses they report are also unlikely to 20 \nbe in vivo concentrations.  Lifetime heavy metal exposure cannot be deduced from 21 \ndiagenetically altered concentrations. 22 \n 23 \nKeywords: Human bone; Heavy metals; Historical periods; diagenesis. 24 \n 25 \n 26 \nMart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) have recently published in this journal analyses of the lead, 27 \ncopper, zinc, and cadmium content of human bone mineral from the Cartagena region, from 28 \nwhich they draw conclusions about changing exposure of humans to these elements since the 29 \nNeolithic.  Unfortunately they neglect to undertake two essential and critical evaluations of 30 \nany chemical analysis of archaeological bone:  31 \n1. Are the results physiologically plausible?   32 \n2. Could there be subtle diagenetic changes?   33 \nThey also report values for teeth, treating them equally with the bone values, even though 34 \nteeth are composed of two distinct tissues \u2013 dentine and enamel \u2013 with distinct properties and 35 \nwidely differing elemental concentrations in vivo, and in this brief comment I will not 36 \nconsider teeth further. 37 \n 38 \n2 \nMore than twenty years ago Waldron (Waldron, 1983) demonstrated that physiologically 39 \nplausible lead concentrations could be obtained from archaeological bones, but that these 40 \nvalues were also highly correlated with the concentrations of lead in the burial soils of the 41 \nindividual bones, and therefore post-mortem uptake was likely to be determining the lead 42 \nconcentrations in archaeological bones.  Other elements are also known to be highly 43 \nsusceptible to diagenesis. Trickett et al. (Trickett et al., 2003) have demonstrated using 44 \nisotopes that strontium in bone may be 100% diagenetically derived, even when the 45 \nconcentrations are within physiological limits.  Pike & Richards (Pike and Richards, 2002), 46 \nusing theoretical considerations, have reached the conclusion that the observed levels of 47 \narsenic in archaeological bone can be diagenetically derived at levels determined solely by the 48 \npartition coefficients between the soil and groundwater, and groundwater and bone.   49 \nSimilarly uranium concentrations are very low in vivo, but often high in archaeological bone 50 \ndue to the high partition between uranium in groundwater and bone (Millard and Hedges, 51 \n1995).  Given these well established facts, all elemental concentrations measured in 52 \narchaeological bone must be robustly assessed for diagenesis, on an element-by-element 53 \nbasis, and they should be considered suspect unless other evidence, such as isotopic ratios, or 54 \ntheir uniform distribution in the bone plus lack of correlation with soil levels, suggests their 55 \nreliability.   56 \n 57 \nIf one considers the physiological plausibility of the lead and iron values obtained by 58 \nMart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005), it becomes apparent that diagenesis has occurred in some of 59 \ntheir samples and may well have done in all of them.   60 \n 61 \n3 \nFor lead they report concentrations in adult bones up to 1035ppm and for children 269-62 \n1139ppm.  Corrucini et al. (Corrucini et al., 1987), provide a preliminary equation relating 63 \nblood lead and tibial lead concentrations in adults, which may be written: 64 \n blood Pb [ g\/dl] = 0.531  (dry bone Pb [ppm] +0.9) \/ (0.03  years of exposure) 65 \nHowever a more definitive version of this equation does not seem to have been published.  If 66 \nwe assume adults live to 50 years on average and children to 10 years, we can obtain lifetime 67 \nmean blood lead levels.  On this basis blood lead levels in Cartagenian adults were up to 360 68 \ng\/dl, and in children ranged 480-2000 g\/dl.  Although these estimates are crude, applying a 69 \npreliminary equation for adult tibial lead to other bones and to children, they are unlikely to 70 \nbe out by as much as an order of magnitude.  The highest blood lead levels estimated here for 71 \nadults and all those for children are extraordinarily far above the 70 g\/dl threshold which 72 \nwarrants emergency medical treatment in cases of acute lead poisoning, let alone the 10 g\/dl 73 \nthreshold which warrants medical monitoring.  Above 70 g\/dl people suffer severe 74 \nneurological symptoms and even death (C.D.C., 1991).  Further, these estimates are lifetime 75 \naverages, which if realistic for in vivo concentrations must represent long-term, chronic lead 76 \npoisoning at a level which it is unlikely that any person could survive for a few months, let 77 \nalone years.  They are therefore physiologically totally implausible and likely to be diagenetic 78 \nin origin. 79 \n 80 \nMart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) report iron levels ranging 36 ppm to 9600 ppm in adults and 81 \n330 ppm to 21000 ppm (i.e. 2.1%!) in children.  A \"standard adult human\" has an Fe\/Ca ratio 82 \nof 0.0042 according to the data in Emsley (Emsley, 1998) and therefore if all the iron in the 83 \nhuman body resided in bone mineral the iron concentration in bone mineral would be about 84 \n1680 ppm.  Actually, most of the iron is in the blood and thus the true bone iron concentration 85 \nwill be much less than this.  As Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) note \"[i]ron absorption by the 86 \n4 \nhuman body is precisely regulated on the basis of existing needs\", and therefore iron levels in 87 \nthe body rarely exceed what is necessary.  Thus the observed values cannot represent true in 88 \nvivo values of iron in bone mineral in the majority of archaeological cases here and diagenetic 89 \neffects must be occurring.  From the relatively high values, I suspect that the modern samples 90 \nare also contaminated, this time by blood.  Diagenetic addition of iron is entirely consistent 91 \nwith previous studies which have found iron minerals such as pyrites and vivianite in bone 92 \npores (e.g. Piepenbrink, 1989) and that iron is distributed on the outer surfaces of bone and on 93 \nthe walls of Haversian canals (Badone and Farquhar, 1982; Millard, 1993). 94 \n 95 \nIf the some of the lead and iron levels in the bones studied by Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) 96 \nare physiologically implausible and as we have strong evidence from other studies that these 97 \nelements are subject to diagenetic effects, then diagenetic alteration of these elements' 98 \nconcentrations seems most likely.  Given this, one must suspect very strongly the possibility 99 \nof diagenetic effects for copper, zinc and cadmium in these bones as well.  Archaeological 100 \nbone trace element concentrations are very likely to be altered from in vivo values by 101 \ndiagenesis (Millard, 2001; Reiche et al., 2003) and thus must always be handled very 102 \ncritically and with due caution.  For the data of Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) it would appear 103 \nthat using bone element concentrations to make deductions about changing human exposure 104 \nto heavy metals through the ages was a futile exercise. 105 \n 106 \nAcknowledgement 107 \nI thank Alistair Pike for comments on a draft of this article. 108 \nReferences 109 \n 110 \n5 \nBadone E, and Farquhar RM (1982) Application of neutron activation analysis to the study of 111 \nelement concentration and exchange in fossil bones.
