The \nobject of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of educational health \ninequalities varies between European countries with different welfare regimes. The data \nsource is based on the first and second wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), \ncomprising more than 80,000 respondents. Two health indicators were applied. The first \ndescribes people\u201fs mental and physical health in general, while the second reports cases of \nany limiting longstanding illness. Educational inequalities in health were measured as the \ndifference in health between people with average number of years of education and people \nwhose educational years lay one standard deviation below the national average. South \nEuropean welfare regimes had the largest health inequalities (with an exception of a smaller \nrate difference for limiting longstanding illness), while countries with Bismarckian welfare \nregimes tended to demonstrate the smallest. Although the other welfare regimes ranked \nrelatively close to each other, the Scandinavian welfare regimes were placed less favourably \nthan the Anglo-Saxon and East European. Thus, this study showed an evident patterning of \nmagnitudes of health inequalities according to features of European welfare regimes. \nAlthough the greater distribution of welfare benefits within the Scandinavian countries are \nlikely to have a protective effect for disadvantaged in these countries, other factors such as \nrelative deprivation and class patterned health behaviours might be acting to widen \ndisparities in health.  \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nRecent studies using data collected in national health surveys or national longitudinal mortality \nstudies have indicated that considerable socio-economic inequalities in morbidity and mortality \nare present across Europe (Cavelaars et al., 1998; Fox, 1994; Huisman et al., 2003; 2004; Kunst et \nal., 2005; Lahelma et al., 1994; Mackenbach, 2005, Mackenbach et al, 1997a; 1997b; 1999; 2000; \nSilventoinen & Lahelma, 2002; Knesebeck et al., 2006). Rather surprisingly, given that their \noverall population health is amongst the best in the world, countries that emphasise egalitarian \nprinciples, such as Sweden and Norway, do not seem to offer any exceptions in this respect. This \nhas generated public debate and political mobilization within the Social Democratic welfare \nstates, as well as extensive discussion as to how social inequalities in health should be tackled and \nmeasured (Judge et al., 2005). This also leaves open to question to what extent socio-economic \ninequalities in health in European countries are related to the type of welfare state. Previous \nstudies have shown that overall population health differs substantially by welfare regime (Navarro \net al, 2003; 2006; Coburn, 2004; Bambra, 2006). Therefore, in this study we examine whether the \nmagnitude of socio-economic inequalities (assessed using the proxy measure of educational level) \nin self-assessed health varies by welfare regime. Specifically, we examine the following two \nhypotheses:  \n \n(1) Different types of welfare regimes are associated with differences in overall levels of \nhealth, and relative and absolute health inequalities.  \n(2) The cross-national variation in health and inequalities in health is smaller within specific \nwelfare regimes than between different welfare regimes.  \n \nEducational inequalities in health in Europe \nPeople with lower educational attainment have poorer self-reported health, higher rates of \ninfectious disease and shorter life expectancy than the better educated (Feldman et al., 1989; \n 4 \nGuralnik et al., 1993; Kitagawa & Hauser, 1973).  Although people\u201fs socioeconomic position may \nbe more accurately expressed by occupation or income, we might argue that education lies at the \nheart of people\u201fs position in society because it is a fundamental determinant of both occupation \nand income (Lahelma, 2001; Ross & Wu, 1995). Education is a widely applied measure of \nsocioeconomic position and reflects people\u201fs material and non-material resources and shapes the \nlikelihood of being unemployed (Knesebeck, 2006). Within Europe, the size of educational \ninequalities in health varies, and it has been shown that health inequalities by educational level are \nrelatively large in the welfare states of Sweden,\n \nNorway and Denmark, while inequalities in Spain, \nSwitzerland and\n \nWest Germany are smaller. Intermediate positions have been observed for \nFinland, UK, France, and Italy (Cavelaars et al, 1998). A Finnish study comparing the Nordic \nwelfare states, found that educational health inequalities in 1994 were largest in\n \nNorway \n(Silventoinen & Lahelma, 2002). More recent international studies have also documented that the \nsize of educational health inequalities varies between countries (Huisman et al., 2003; Knesebeck \net al., 2006). However, no study has yet specifically tested differences in inequalities in health \nbetween countries according to welfare regime theory.  \n \nWelfare regimes \nIn the Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism (1990), Esping-Andersen presents the first serious \nattempt to classify welfare states. His typology is based upon the operationalization of three \nprinciples: decommodification (the extent to which an individual\u201fs welfare is reliant upon the \nmarket), social stratification (the role of welfare states in maintaining or breaking down social \nstratification), and the private-public mix (the relative roles of the state, the family and the market \nin welfare provision). The application of these principles leads to the division of welfare states \ninto three ideal regime types (Figure 1): Liberal, Conservative, and Social Democratic. The modal \nexamples of the three regimes are USA (Liberal), Germany (Conservative), and Sweden (Social \nDemocratic). In the Liberal regime countries, state provision of welfare is minimal, benefits are \n 5 \nmodest and often attract strict entitlement criteria, and recipients are usually means-tested and \nstigmatized (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 26). The Conservative welfare state regime is distinguished \nby its \u201estatus differentiating\u201f welfare programs in which benefits are often earnings related, \nadministered through the employer, and geared towards maintaining existing social patterns. The \nrole of the family is also emphasized and the redistributive impact is minimal (1990: 27). The \nSocial Democratic regime is the smallest regime cluster. Welfare provision is characterized by \nuniversal and comparatively generous benefits, a commitment to full employment and income \nprotection, and a strongly interventionist state used to promote equality through a redistributive \nsocial security system.  \n \n-- Figure 1 about here -- \n \nThere has been extensive scholarly debate about the theoretical and empirical value of the Three \nWorlds (for a detailed summary see Arts & Gelissen, 2002). Numerous critiques exist about the \nrange of countries and regimes most notably the misclassification of the Southern European \nwelfare states as immature Conservative ones or placing the Antipodean welfare states in the \nLiberal regime (see for example, Leibfreid, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; \nBonoli, 1997; Navarro et al, 2003); the absence of gender in the typology (see for example, \nSainsbury, 1994, 1999; Bambra, 2004; in press); the methodology (Castles & Mitchell, 1993; \nKangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Fawcett & Papadopoulos, 1997; Pitruzello, 1999; Bambra, 2006); the \nanalytical focus on cash benefits (Alber & Standing, 2000; Abrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002; \nBambra, 2005a; 2005b), and the creation of regimes that generalize about all forms of social \npolicy provision from this base (Kasza, 2002; Bambra, 2005a, 2005b).  \n \nAs a result of this criticism, modified or alternative typologies have been proposed by others \n(Leibfried, 1992; Castles & Mitchell, 1993; Siaroff, 1994; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Korpi & \n 6 \nPalme, 1998; Navarro et al, 2003; Bambra, 2004, 2005b, in press), most of which place emphasis \non those characteristics of welfare states not extensively examined by Esping-Andersen. The \nwelfare ideal-types of Esping-Andersen have also been tested empirically (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, \n1994; Wildeboer Schut et al, 2001; Bambra, 2006, 2007). Although the findings were not totally \nconsistent, the major concern was that Esping-Andersen\u201fs typology does not fully capture country \nrange and variation and that therefore, the insertion of a fourth \u201eSouthern European\u201f regime is \nrequired (Leibfreid, 1992; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Bambra, 2007). However, we have yet to \nsee a new categorisation, which has been generally accepted as the new standard typology of \nwelfare regimes, although Ferrera\u201fs four-fold typology has been highlighted as one of the most \naccurate (Bambra, 2007). Ferrera focuses on different dimensions of how social benefits are \ngranted and organised, and makes a distinction between the Scandinavian (Social Democratic), \nAnglo-Saxon (Liberal), Bismarckian (Conservative) and Southern countries (Figure 1). Although \nthere are clear similarities between Ferrera\u201fs and Esping-Andersen\u201fs typologies, Ferrera\u201fs \nclassification is intended to account for differences in the way welfare is delivered whilst Esping-\nAndersen\u201fs still tends to emphasise the quantity of welfare provided (Bonoli, 1997; Bambra, \n2007). In this way, the additional Southern regime is characterised by a fragmented system of \nwelfare provision which consists of diverse income maintenance schemes that range from the \nmeagre to the generous and a health care system that provides only limited and partial coverage. \nThere is also a strong reliance on the family and charitable sector (Ferrera, 1996). \n \nOne new challenge to conventional welfare regime typologies concerns the Eastern European \ncountries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia). According to \nEsping-Andersen (1999), these countries comprise clearly the most under defined and \nunderstudied region. These countries have experienced extensive economic upheaval and have \nundertaken comprehensive social reforms throughout the 1990s (Kovacs, 2002). They have \nemphasised the Liberal regime approaches of marketisation, decentralization and the reform of \n 7 \nhealth insurance schemes (EC and WHO, 2002). In comparison with the other member states of \nthe European Union, they have limited health service provision and overall population health is \nrelatively poor. It will therefore be interesting to see how these countries rank in comparison to \nmore established Western European welfare states.  \n \nOur study utilises survey data from 23 European countries, which we categorise into five regimes \nbased upon Ferrera\u201fs (1996) classification, plus an additional category for Eastern Europe (Table \n1). \n \n--- Table 1 about here --- \n \nData and Methods  \nThis study was conducted as part of the European Union funded \u201eTackling Health Inequalities in \nEurope (Eurothine)\u201f project (http:\/\/mgzlx4.erasmusmc.nl\/eurothine\/). It is based on data from the \nfirst and second wave of the European Social Survey (ESS), fielded in 2002 and 2004, comprising \nmore than 80,000 respondents in 23 countries. The main objective of the ESS is to provide high \nquality data over time about changing social attitudes and values in Europe. The data and \nextensive documentation are freely available for downloading at the Norwegian Social Science \nData Services (NSD) web site (http:\/\/www.nsd.uib.no). A total number of 77805 respondents were \navailable in the sample after deleting cases listwise by each variable in our analysis. It should be \nnoted that we have data for only one year with respect to Italy, Slovakia, and Estonia, which \nmakes the sample size smaller in these countries compared to the others, as shown in Table 1. \nResponse percentages are also given in Table 1. Most countries have a sufficient response, but we \nare left with some uncertainty regarding the low response percentage of Switzerland in the first \nESS-round (33.5 %). Another methodological issue is that our sample comes from two sweeps of \nthe ESS. We therefore tested the effect of combining these data by means of a sensitivity analysis. \n 8 \nThis analysis (not shown in tables) showed that our main results could be replicated on the basis \nof each survey separately.   \n \nWe used both indicators of morbidity available in the ESS: self reported general health and \nlimiting longstanding illness. Self reported general health was constructed from a variable \nasking; \u201eHow is your (physical and mental) health in general?\u201f. Eligible responses were \u201every \ngood\u201f, \u201egood\u201f, \u201efair\u201f, \u201ebad\u201f, and \u201every bad\u201f. We dichotomized the variable into \u201every good or \ngood\u201f health versus \u201eless than good\u201f health (\u201efair\u201f, \u201ebad\u201f, and \u201every bad\u201f). As for limiting \nlongstanding illness, people were asked if they were hampered in daily activities in any way by \nany longstanding illness or disability, infirmity or mental health problem. Eligible responses \nwere \u201eyes a lot\u201f, \u201eyes to some extent\u201f and \u201eno\u201f. We dichotomized this variable into \u201eyes\u201f \n(regardless of whether to some extent or a lot) and \u201eno\u201f.  \n \nComputation and interpretation of the measure of educational inequalities in health \nThe ESS-data file provides two variables of educational attainment \u2013 the first is a recoded \nvariable that focuses on levels of education achieved, while the second gives years of full-time \neducation. Analysing education as highest attained level complicates comparisons between \ncountries as the population distribution across the levels of education strongly differs between \ncountries (Knesebeck et al, 2006). One solution would be to adjust for the size of each \neducational group by calculating the RII (Mackenback & Kunst, 1997b).  However, we prefer to \nuse the second available variable on education in our sample - full-time education in years \u2013 \nbecause there is a higher degree of international comparability and flexibility in its use. We also \nhave to take into account the extent of variations of reported years of education in different \ncountries, because the variation is larger in for example southern countries compared to the \nnorthern. We did this by applying a total impact measure of education. First, for each country \nseparately, we standardised the continuous variables of educational attainment, such that the \n 9 \nnational average was equal to 0 and the standard deviation equal to 1 year of education. Second, \nwe reverted this variable by multiplying it with a factor of -1, such that higher values \ncorresponded with lower educational levels. Next, the standardised variable was introduced as an \nindependent variable in a logistic regression analysis, controlled for age, with health variables as \nthe dependent variable. Finally, we transformed the odds ratios of each regression coefficient by \ncalculating their exponential functions. The odds ratios should be interpreted as the health \ndifference between people with average years of education and those whose number of year of \neducation is one standard deviation below the national average. \n \nThe first hypothesis that is tested in our study states that welfare regimes are associated with both \nabsolute and relative measures of health inequalities. Firstly, we calculated the (age-adjusted) \npercentages of the total sample reporting fair\/poor general health and limiting longstanding \nillness in each country. Secondly, we calculated the rate differences (RD) between the higher and \nlower education group using the median of the total impact measure within each country as cut-\noff point. Both measures were age-standardized using the weighted European population average \nas a basis. \n \nTo assess the extent to which cross-national differences in the magnitude of health inequalities \ncould be explained by grouping countries according to welfare type we performed one-way \nANOVA tests. We specifically tested whether the between group variance of the three statistical \nmeasures (overall prevalence, absolute difference, and relative inequalities) differed significantly \nfrom the within group variance. In addition, we calculated R squares by dividing the between \ngroup sums of squares (SSb) with the total sums of squares (SSt), in order to determine the \npercentages of between-country variance that is explained by the welfare regime clusters.  \n \n 10 \nThe analysis is based on responses from people aged 18 or over. A weight has been applied \n(dweight) to correct for design effects due to sampling designs in countries where not all \nindividuals in the population have an identical selection probability. \n \nResults \nTable 2 shows that East European welfare regimes have the highest prevalence of ill-health for \nmen and women with respect to both health indicators. South European welfare regimes have the \nsecond highest prevalence of self-assessed fair\/poor general health, while they have the lowest \nprevalence of limiting longstanding illness. The dissimilar reporting of ill-health between \nlimiting longstanding illness and self-assessed fair\/poor health in the South is relatively large. \nAlthough the prevalence of fair\/poor self-assessed health is larger than those of limiting \nlongstanding illness within all other welfare regimes, the difference is largest in the South. This \nmight suggest that self-assessed health is comprehended differently the South than elsewhere. \nThe Anglo-Saxon welfare regimes demonstrate the smallest prevalence rates for fair\/poor \ngeneral health and the second smallest for limiting longstanding illness.  \n \n--- Table 2 about here --- \nFurthermore, Table 2 shows that health inequalities are significant for both men and women, \naccording to both health indicators, and within all welfare regimes. South European welfare \nregimes have the largest health inequalities, both with respect to rate differences and odds ratios, \nwith the exception of the rate difference for limiting longstanding illness. Clearly, Bismarckian \nwelfare regimes were observed with the smallest health inequalities, even though the prevalence \nrates were only average. Although the other welfare regimes rank relatively close to each other, \nthe Scandinavian welfare regimes are placed less favourably than the Anglo-Saxon and Eastern \nEuropean. Our results refer to the point estimates however, and it should be noted that the \n 11 \nconfidence intervals of the welfare types overlap, meaning that they cross-regime variations in \nhealth inequalities might be attributable to chance fluctuations. Country-specific results are \nshown in Table 3. Prevalence rates and odds ratios were also converged into scatter plots (Figure \n2 and 3), showing graphically whether the countries cluster within each welfare regime.  \n \n--- Table 3, Figure 2 and Figure 3 about here --- \n \nFigure 2 and Figure 3 give the results for men and women\u201fs reporting of limiting longstanding \nillness and fair\/poor general health respectively. The Scandinavian countries are pretty tightly \nclustered. The only divergence from this pattern was found with respect to the reporting of \nfair\/poor general health among Finnish (high OR compared to other Scandinavian countries) and \nSwedish (low OR compared to other Scandinavian countries) men. The South European \ncountries, which do not appear to cluster markedly with respect to the results of self-assessed \nfair\/poor health, reported fewest cases of longstanding illness, but had relatively large relative \nhealth inequalities. However, it should be remarked that Italian men and women, together with \nSpanish men, demonstrate smaller odds ratios than the other South European countries. \n \nBismarckian countries are fairly clustered below the x-axis, which indicates average odds ratios. \nThe only exception is with regard to the high odds ratios reported among Luxembourg men \nconcerning the reporting of fair\/poor general health. With respect to the Anglo-Saxon welfare \nregime, Ireland seems to have lower prevalence rates than those of Great Britain, but both \ncountries are advantageously placed with regard to both sexes and both health indicators. \nAlthough men and women living in East European countries reported poorer general health and \nmore cases of limiting longstanding illness than people in other European countries, they \n 12 \ndemonstrated average magnitudes of odds ratios. However, a few exceptions should be \nmentioned. First, Polish men have higher odds ratios with respect to the results of limiting \nlongstanding illness. Secondly, Hungarian women have highest odds ratios for self-assessed \nhealth, while the odds ratios are among the smallest for Slovak men and women with regard to \nself-assessed health. Generally, for limiting longstanding illness among both men and women, \nthe countries cluster according to welfare typologies. For fair\/poor general health, however, the \nclustering is not as strong. \n \nThe one-way ANOVA-test showed that within welfare group variance is significantly smaller \nthan the between welfare group variance for measures of limiting longstanding illness (except \nfrom the RD-measure of men), but not with regard to fair\/poor general health (except from the \nprevalence) (see Table 4). This implies that the Ferrera welfare typology explains at least 50% of \nthe cross-national variations with regards to longstanding illness, but not with regard to general \nhealth.  \n \n--- Table 4 about here --- \n \nDiscussion \nOur results have provided evidence for the hypothesis that welfare regimes are associated with \ncross-national differences in the overall level of self-reported health, and with absolute and \nrelative educational health gaps. We observed that East European welfare regimes have the \nhighest prevalence of both health indicators, while South European welfare regimes have the \nsecond highest prevalence of self-assessed poor general health, and the lowest prevalence of \nlimiting longstanding illness. Apart from the low prevalence in the South for limiting \nlongstanding illness, the Anglo-Saxon welfare regimes have the lowest prevalence for both \nhealth indicators and for both sexes. Furthermore, Southern European welfare regimes have the \n 13 \nlargest health inequalities (with an exception of the rate difference for limiting longstanding \nillness), while countries with Bismarckian welfare regimes tend to demonstrate the smallest. \nAlthough the East European, Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian welfare regimes rank relatively \nclose to each other, the Scandinavian welfare regimes are placed less favourably than the Anglo-\nSaxon and Eastern European. Furthermore, countries within each welfare regime seem to cluster \nstrongly according to most measures of longstanding illness.  \n \nThere are some important methodological issues that may have influenced our results. Firstly, \nthe ESS response rates vary strongly between countries, as shown in Table 2. This is especially \nthe case for the first wave in Switzerland, which had a response rate of only 33.5 %. This number \nis critically small, and it could be the reason why Switzerland has lower prevalence rates, \nabsolute differences and odds ratios than the average scores for both health indicators and for \nboth sexes. If the non-response is related to health and socio-economic position, then this would \nproduce biased inequality measures. \n \nSecondly, we found that the country clustering in 5 welfare regimes is more evident for the \nresults of longstanding illness compared to those of less than good general health. This seems \nreasonable, because people\u201fs view on general health is profoundly shaped by their national \ncultural background (Salomon et al., 2004; Appels et al., 1996; Jylh\u00e4 et al., 1998). The \ndifferences in absolute levels of health between countries may suggest that the question on \ngeneral health is perceived differently across countries, and is thus sensitive to cultural \nvariations. We have already noted that self-assessed health might be comprehended differently in \nthe South than elsewhere, and this would bias the odds ratios if the comprehension of health also \nvaries across educational levels. However, a growing number of studies have shown that \nmeasures of self assessed health are strongly correlated with more objective measures such as \nmortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Heistaro et al., 2001). We also calculated Pearson\u201fs \n 14 \ncorrelation between subjective health measures (age-adjusted percentage of people with fair\/poor \nhealth and limiting longstanding illness) with adult mortality, using data collected from the \nWHO. The results demonstrated that high age-adjusted prevalence of fair\/poor general health \n(Rmen=0.82, Rwomen=0.58) and limiting longstanding illness (Rmen=0.45, Rwomen=0.48) is \nassociated with higher adult mortality for men and for women, but particularly with respect to \nmen\u201fs fair\/poor general health. Previous studies have also shown that the apparent association of \nself-assessed health with mortality does not, or only slightly, differ between socio-economic \ngroups (Burstrom et al., 2001; Van Doorslaer & Gerdtham, 2003; Huisman et al., 2007). \n \nWelfare state regimes, health and health inequalities \nWe observed that countries with lowest average years of education, namely the Southern and \nEastern European countries, have the largest overall prevalence rates of ill-health (except for the \nlower prevalence of limiting longstanding illness in the South), whilst the Anglo-Saxon countries \nhave the lowest prevalence rates. This is in keeping with the majority of previous research into \nvariations in population health (such as infant mortality or total mortality) by welfare state \nregimes (see for example, Navarro et al, 2003; 2006; Coburn, 2004; Bambra, 2006).  \n \nWe observed that grouping welfare regimes explained a meaningful part of the variance in the \nprevalence, and absolute and relative health gaps of limiting longstanding illness of the relevant \nEuropean populations. This partly confirms our second hypothesis that grouping countries into \nwelfare types decreases the variation of health inequality measures significantly. The country \nclustering in five welfare regimes was more evident for the results of limiting longstanding \nillness compared to those of less than good general health.  \n \nA recent review on studies of morbidity differences Dahl et al. (2006) did not find a patterning of \nhealth inequalities according to features of welfare regimes. However, their study rested on \n 15 \nEsping-Andersen\u201fs typology, it was based on measures of relative inequalities only, and in \naddition, national data sources were used, with a lower degree of international variation, which \ncomprised fewer countries than the ESS. \n \nIt appeared that health inequalities in our study were smallest in Bismarckian countries and \nlargest in Southern Europe. This finding is in keeping with other studies.  Two previous studies \nof general self-reported health by level of education using the European Community Household \nPanel (ECHP) support these findings. In a study of older men and women, Huisman et al. (2003) \nfound lowest health inequalities in Bismarckian countries (Belgium, France and Belgium) and \nlargest in the south (Italy, Greece and Spain). Denmark, which was the only Nordic country in \nthis study, had large inequalities for men, but smaller inequalities among women. They also \nfound rather large inequalities in the two Anglo-Saxon countries. Using the same survey, Van \nDoorslaer & Koolman (2004) found particularly large income related health inequalities in self-\nassessed health in Portugal and relatively low inequalities in Netherlands and Germany.  \n \nWith regard to chronic conditions, Dalstra et al. (2005) compared results from eight national \nhealth surveys and did not find higher or smaller health inequalities with respect to nine chronic \ndisease groups in the South (Italy and Spain) compared to Bismarckian countries (Belgium, \nFrance and the Netherlands). However, they observed smaller inequalities in heart disease \nprevalence.  Cavelaars et al. (1998) did not reveal a pattern between Bismarckian and South \nEuropean countries, but they found a tendency for inequalities to be relatively large in the North \n(Sweden, Norway and Denmark).  \n \nThe studies on morbidity are largely confirmed by previous comparative studies on mortality \ndifferences by educational level. Mackenbach et al. (1997) reported average-size inequalities in \nthe Nordic countries, while Huisman et al. (2005) found smaller inequalities in total mortality in \n 16 \nmen and women aged 40 or more in Turin and Barcelona & Madrid compared to Belgium, \nAustria and Switzerland.  \n \nWe should be aware that those reports were based on different data sources, covering different \nperiods and partly different age groups. Only a few of these studies found that South European \ncountries had large inequalities, compared to Bismarckian countries. A generalised finding \nthough is that inequalities in the Nordic countries are not among the smallest. \n \nThe Scandinavian welfare regime \nNotably, in terms of educational health inequality, countries in the Scandinavian welfare regime \nwere placed less favourably than those in the Anglo-Saxon and Eastern European regimes. Only \nSweden shows relatively small inequalities from an international perspective, perhaps reflecting \nthe longevity of the Swedish welfare state. These results are surprising, as we would have \nexpected the Scandinavian welfare states, given that they provide the most extensive welfare \nprovision (for example, they are the most decommodifying (Esping-Andersen, 1990)), to be some \nof the best performing countries in terms of the degree of health equity. Not only did we find that \nrelative inequalities in the Scandinavian regimes were not among the smallest, but worryingly, \nthis was also the case with regard to absolute inequalities.  \n \nThis finding requires attention. Drawing upon the work of Dahl et al (2006), we speculate that \nrelative deprivation, and class related health behaviours may be factors behind our findings. In \naddition, we suggest that social exclusion may be a contributory mechanism. \nRelative deprivation is result of expectations and comparisons with other individuals and groups \n(Dahl et al, 2006). Relative deprivation will occur in all societies, in which there is inequality, \nincluding the Scandinavian welfare states. Following Dahl and colleagues, it is possible to \n 17 \nspeculate that the effects of relative deprivation may be more extensive in the Scandinavian \nwelfare states because of the high levels of expectation of upward social mobility and prosperity \nthat they generate amongst the less privileged, expectations that are seldom met (Yngwe et al. \n2003). This may increase health inequalities especially in stress related conditions, such as heart \ndisease or indeed self-assessed health.  \nDahl and colleagues also suggest that the relatively large socio-economic differences in smoking \nprevalence in the Scandinavian countries (Cavelaars et al. 2000) may well contribute to health \ninequalities.  \n \nFurthermore, the previously homogenous Scandinavian countries have experienced considerable \nimmigration over the last decade. Immigrants are often marginalised within the Scandinavian \nwelfare states, and are without entitlement to the full benefits of the universalistic system and are \nmore likely to experience unemployment and social exclusion. Such groups are also most likely to \nbe amongst the least educated in society. A study comparing immigrants from Poland, Turkey, \nand Iran with Swedish born persons revealed a strong association between ethnicity and poor self \nreported health, which was mediated by socioeconomic status, poor acculturation, and \ndiscrimination (Wiking et al., 2004). Another study found a large diversity of self-rated health, \nprevalence of diabetes and distress between ethnic Pakistanis and native Norwegians (Syed et al., \n2006). However, further research into the ethnic make up of people with the lowest education \nwould be useful to explore this explanation. \nAlthough these different explanations are somewhat speculative, they point to causal mechanisms \nin which education may play a role. Finding empirical evidence for these causal mechanisms \nshould be explored in future studies. \n \n 18 \nConclusion \nThe prevalence of ill-health, and absolute and relative educational inequalities in health in \nEuropean countries appears to cluster according to the welfare regimes to which these countries \nbelong. This was especially the case with regard to the reporting of limiting longstanding illness. \nWelfare is provided in dissimilar fashion both qualitatively and quantitatively across welfare \nregimes. In addition to comparing countries individually, forthcoming research might thus derive \nadvantage from adapting a welfare regimes point of view. \n \nOur results suggest that the \u201cSouth European\u201d (excluding Italy) family-oriented welfare system \ndoes not sufficiently buffer ill-health among disadvantaged groups. Italy pioneered the welfare \nstate expansion in the South by the end of the 1940s, while democracy consolidated in the late \n1970s (and welfare state expansion even later) in Portugal, Spain and Greece in a highly \ncompressed time (Ferrera, 2005). Although the South European countries have fully caught up \nwith the traditional Western democracies in terms of economic growth and rapid expansion of \nthe welfare system, they entered the epoch of modernity in a state of socio-economic and \npolitical decline (Sapelli, 1995).  \n \nAlthough the Eastern European countries had the highest prevalence rates, they moreover held an \naverage position in Europe, both with regard to absolute and relative educational inequalities in \nhealth. Future research would benefit from considering Eastern European countries as a separate \nwelfare state regime and to look at the health effects of specific distributive policies and \nmechanisms within these countries.  \n \nThe Scandinavian countries, except from Sweden, had rather large relative and absolute \ninequalities in health and only intermediate prevalence rates. The distribution of welfare benefits \nwithin the Scandinavian countries certainly has a protective effect for disadvantaged groups \n 19 \ncompared to those in other welfare regimes. However, we should question to what extent this is \ncounteracted by some unintended mechanisms, such as expectations of upward social mobility \nand prosperity that might tend to inadvertently widen educational inequalities in health.  \n \n 20 \nReferences \n \n\u00c5berg Yngwe, M., Fritzell, J., Lundberg, O., Diderichsen, F., & Burstr\u00f6m, B.
