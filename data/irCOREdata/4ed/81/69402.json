Nine \nhostage negotiations were divided into 6 time stages and the dialogue of police \nnegotiators and hostage takers analyzed across 18 linguistic categories.  Correlational \nanalyses showed that successful negotiations were associated with higher aggregate \nlevels of Linguistic Style Matching (LSM) than unsuccessful negotiations.  This result \nwas due to dramatic fluctuations of LSM during unsuccessful negotiations, with \nnegotiators unable to maintain the constant levels of rapport and coordination that \noccurred in successful negotiations.  A further analysis of LSM at the local turn-by-turn \nlevel revealed complex but organized variations in behavior across outcome.  In \ncomparison to unsuccessful negotiations, the dialogue of successful negotiations involved \ngreater coordination of turn taking, reciprocation of positive affect, a focus on the present \nrather than the past, and a focus on alternatives rather than on competition. \nLinguistic Style Matching   3 \nLinguistic Style Matching and Negotiation Outcome \nConflict researchers have long been interested in uncovering the communicative \ndynamics that determine whether or not a negotiation is successful.  This interest has \nparticular prominence in crisis negotiation research, where outcome has been shown to \nrelate to differences in relational dynamics (Donohue & Roberto, 1993), behavioral \ncompetitiveness (Taylor, 2002a), the reciprocation of offers and arguments (Giebels & \nTaylor, in press), and many other facets of the interpersonal process.  However, to date, \nresearch in crisis negotiation has given almost no consideration to the importance of \nlanguage use.  This oversight is significant, not least because the words and phrases that \nspeakers use to negotiate a crisis represent the channel through which instrumental and \nrelational dynamics are played out.  Understanding how language use shapes the \ndevelopment of a negotiation is therefore likely to provide significant insights into the \ninterpersonal dynamics of conflict.  This paper focuses on one aspect of language use \nknown as linguistic style matching, and considers its role in determining how crisis \nnegotiations unfold and resolve. \nLinguistic Style Matching (LSM)  \nWhen two people interact, their utterances are patterned and coordinated, with \neach individual\u2019s cues and responses fitting into a sequence of interconnected events \n(Auld & White, 1959; Putnam, 1985).  In the nonverbal literature, this coordination of \nactions is considered essential to interaction success.  Facial expressions, non-verbal \nbehaviors, kinetics and proxemics have each been shown to coordinate in systematic and \norganized ways to enhance the communication process (Ellis & Beattie, 1986).  The same \nis true in the communication literature.  According to Giles\u2019s Communication \nLinguistic Style Matching   4 \nAccommodation Theory (Giles & Coupland, 1991), individuals continually adapt their \ncommunication behavior to create, maintain or decrease the social distance between \nthemselves and the other party.  One strategy that reduces social distance is convergence, \nwhich involves an individual adapting his or her use of gestures, idioms, and behavioral \nstrategies so that they become more similar to those used by the other party.  This occurs, \nfor example, in criminal trials, where witnesses adjust the type of answer that they \nprovide in order to accommodate to more and less coercive questioning by the lawyer \n(Gnisci, 2005).  Finally, the concept of coordination is evident in negotiation theory.  \nCoordination of behavior is posited as central to macro level constructs such as role \ncomplementarity (Donohue, 2001), and to micro level processes such as the mechanism \nthat constrains negotiators\u2019 response to the other party\u2019s cue (Olekalns, Brett, & Weingart, \n2003; Taylor & Donald, 2003). \nMore recently, the concept of coordination has been considered at the level of \nlanguage or linguistic style.  Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002), in particular, propose a \ncoordination-engagement hypothesis that predicts high coordination, or high Linguistic \nStyle Matching (LSM), as people become actively engaged with one another in the \ninteraction.  This hypothesis rests on the notion that individuals\u2019 use of words and \nphrases reflects their global perception of a situation and their explicit concerns and goals \nat any moment in time (Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2002; Taylor, 2002b).  It proposes \nthat people matched in their linguistic styles\u2014in their linguistic presentation of ideas and \narguments\u2014are likely to possess a degree of harmony in the ways they perceive the \nsituation and its potential solutions.  In negotiation terms, the extent to which negotiators \nLinguistic Style Matching   5 \nmatch one another\u2019s linguistic style might provide a useful index of agreement, and may \nbe systematically related to negotiation outcome. \nLinguistic Style Matching (LSM) and Negotiation Outcome \nNiederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002) directly consider the relationship between \nLinguistic Style Matching (LSM) and interaction outcome.  In three studies that examine \nboth student interactions and real world dialogue (interactions between President Nixon \nand his aids), they investigated the relationship between synchrony in speakers\u2019 language \nand several measures of interaction quality.  They compared speakers\u2019 scores over 18 \nlinguistic dimensions of language and found that, in all cases, dyads exhibit significant \nLSM on both a broad conversational level and a turn-by-turn level.  However, in the case \nof the real world dialogue, the extent of verbal matching associated negatively with \nknown facts about both the relationship between the two speakers and the final resolution.  \nSpecifically, in their analysis of the final conversations between Nixon and Dean (when \ntensions and suspicions were high), both speakers showed poor coordination of \ninteraction, a desire to dominate the interaction, and little synchrony in their cognitive \napproach to the problem. \nThis finding is generally consistent with the results of research on crisis \nnegotiation.  Both empirical research and negotiators\u2019 personal accounts concur that \nsuccessful negotiations begin with the development of rapport and trust.  Rapport allows \nnegotiators to build a common framing and understanding of the conflict, which in turn \nallows them to jointly move towards problem solving and a resolution (Cambria, \nDeFilippo, Louden, & McGowan, 2002; Donohue, Ramesh, Kaufman, & Smith, 1991; \nTaylor, 2002b).  Relational Order Theory (Donohue, 2001) is particularly explicit about \nLinguistic Style Matching   6 \nthis process, arguing that the most effective interaction occurs when negotiators establish \nhigh levels of affiliation and interdependence.  These dynamics occur in dialogue as \nsynchronized turn taking, mutual reciprocation of the other\u2019s focus, and general verbal \ncomplementarity. \nA second line of support for the link between LSM and negotiation success comes \nfrom evidence showing that police negotiators can promote \u201centrainment\u201d by adopting \nthe same motivational focus as the hostage taker (Taylor, 2002b; Taylor & Donald, 2004).  \nEntrainment is a process whereby subsequent changes in personal dialogue are mirrored \nby equivalent changes in the other party\u2019s dialogue (McGrath & Kelly, 1986).  This \nevidence, which is consistent with Van Swol\u2019s (2003) finding that nonverbal mirroring \nincreases persuasiveness, provides a theoretical explanation for why high levels of LSM \nmight be linked with greater cooperation and movement towards a successful (i.e., non-\nviolent) resolution of a crisis.  High LSM is a corollary of negotiators framing the conflict \nand its potential solutions in a mutually agreed way.  As such, it allows differences to be \novercome and solutions to be reached. \nTurn-by-Turn LSM and Negotiation Outcome \nThe proposed association between negotiation success and high LSM raises the \nquestion of how negotiators coordinate their language use and, in particular, whether \ncoordination occurs at the basic level of speaking turn.  At least two concepts from the \nliterature on human interaction suggest that negotiators may indeed adapt their responses \nto match the language of the other party\u2019s cue; that of mimicry (e.g., Chartrand & Bargh, \n1999) and limitation (Watzlawick, Beavin, & Jackson, 1968, p. 131). Central to both of \nthese concepts is the observation that one speaker\u2019s cue reduces the possible ways in \nLinguistic Style Matching   7 \nwhich a second speaker can respond, and that one common outcome of this channeling is \na mimicking or matching response (Smith, Pruitt, & Carnevale, 1982; cf. \u201cresponse-in-\nkind\u201d, Weingart, Prietula, Hyder, & Genovese, 1999).  In their analysis of linguistic style \nmatching, Niederhoffer and Pennebaker found that such mimicking of previous behavior \napplied to speakers\u2019 word use. Aspects of a responder\u2019s linguistic style was found to \ncorrelate significantly with characteristics of the sender\u2019s message, thereby suggesting \nthat linguistic style matching may be evident in the cue-response dynamics of \nnegotiators\u2019 interaction. \nThe impact of turn-by-turn dynamics on the quality of an interaction, as well as its \nfinal outcome, has been the focus of research in a number of contexts. For example, \nrecent experimental work has shown that high verbal mimicry correlates positively with \nbetter negotiation outcomes, at least for the person who engages in mimicry (Curhan & \nPentland, 2007; Maddux, Mullen, & Galinsky, 2008). Similarly, in his examination \nof military base rights negotiations, Druckman (1986) found that matched use of hard \nverbal tactics by the Spanish and US delegations correlated with positive turning points \nin the interaction. Conversely, the larger the difference in the delegations\u2019 use of hard \ntactics at any one time, the more likely a crisis would follow in the interaction. Finally, in \nthe hostage negotiation context, Ormerod, Barrett, and Taylor (in press) have shown \nthat being able to maintain equivalently framed utterances (as measured by language \ncharacteristics) is linked to success, with successful negotiations associated with longer \nperiods of synchronous framing compared to unsuccessful negotiations.  Interestingly, \nthis study highlights the importance of considering the role each negotiator takes in \ndetermining and sustaining the synchronous passage.  On some occasions they found that \nLinguistic Style Matching   8 \npolice negotiators remained passive and allowed the hostage taker to determine the \ninteraction frame, while in other circumstances the police appeared to take an active role \nin promoting the framing of dialogue.  Of course, this research was not directly focused \non linguistic style, but it seems plausible that a similar dynamic pertaining to who \ncontrols the linguistic code may emerge. Thus, we may expect negotiation success to be \nassociated with high turn-by-turn linguistic style matching, and we may look to the \npatterns in negotiator dominance to determine how such matching emerges from the \ninteraction. \nChange in Linguistic Style Matching over Time \nContemporary research into conflict negotiation recognizes the importance of \ncapturing patterns of change in behavior over time.  Many studies have associated \nsuccessful negotiations with increased coordination of ideas and reduced levels of \npositional arguing, and unsuccessful negotiations with ineffective relationship \nmanagement and increased competitive bargaining (Jones, 1988; Putnam, Wilson, & \nTurner, 1990; Simons, 1993).  Success comes from a convergence of viewpoints and \npositions over time, which is a phenomenon that language research has associated with \nsynchrony in word use and \u201csmoothness\u201d of interactions (Bernieri & Rosenthal, 1991; \nChartrand & Bargh, 1999).  Consistent with this association is Donohue and Taylor\u2019s \n(2003) study of terrorist negotiations, which found that authorities tend to respond to \nterrorist violence with increased tactical aggression and respond to terrorist dialogue with \nincreased conciliation.  On a more dynamic level, Donohue and Roberto (1996) have \nshown that hostage negotiations move through stages in which parties increase and \ndecrease the similarity of their behavioral orientation.  The extent of this matching in the \nLinguistic Style Matching   9 \nfinal stages of interaction is related to negotiation success, with greater coordination \naround relational and instrumental issues being more likely to lead to a successful \nresolution (Donohue & Taylor, 2003; Olekalns & Smith, 2000; Taylor, 2002a).  \nCurrent Study \nIn this paper we explore the dynamics of linguistic style matching by examining \nthe interactions between police negotiator and hostage taker in nine protracted crisis \nnegotiations.  We use crisis negotiations because they are characterized by a set of \nconditions (e.g., high stakes, considerable ambiguity) that stretch the communication \nprocess beyond what occurs in normative contexts.  They are intense, emotional \ninteractions in which messages often have serious consequences and in which relational \ndynamics (e.g., building trust, saving face) are as important as the need to exchange \ninformation and reach substantive agreements (Donohue et al., 1991; Taylor & Donohue, \n2006).  In a context where negotiators rarely have face-to-face contact, these \ncharacteristics mean that the communication between police negotiator and hostage taker \nis a rich set of data source for testing hypotheses about linguistic style matching.  \n Following Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002) and the findings of negotiation \nresearch, we predict that the relationship between negotiation success and synchrony in \nnegotiators\u2019 orientations would also occur at the word level.  If negotiators increase the \nextent to which their linguistic styles are matched, then this would signify that they hold \nsimilar perspectives of the conflict and its possible resolution.  Such harmony is likely to \nlead to normative problem solving and the enhanced possibility of a successful outcome.   \nWe therefore predicted that: \nLinguistic Style Matching   10 \nHypothesis 1: Successful negotiations will be characterized by a greater degree of \nlinguistic style matching relative to unsuccessful negotiations. \nHypothesis 2: Successful negotiations will be characterized by a greater degree of \nturn-by-turn style matching relative to unsuccessful negotiations. \nHypothesis 3a: Successful negotiations will be characterized by an increase in \nlinguistic style matching over the final stages of interaction. \nHypothesis 3b: Unsuccessful negotiations will be characterized by a decrease in \nlinguistic style matching over the final stages of interaction. \nMethod \nNegotiation Sample \nData were an opportunity sample of transcripts of dialogue from nine actual \nhostage crises.  They were produced from the audiotape recordings of several U.S. police \ndepartments.  The transcripts represent a diverse range of crises that include \u201ccriminal\u201d \nincidents, in which an individual seeks to make a material gain; \u201cdomestic\u201d incidents, in \nwhich an individual seeks sympathy for a personal need; and \u201cpolitical\u201d incidents, in \nwhich an individual seeks to highlight a social movement or political cause.  The \ntranscripts contain 10,486 utterances spoken primarily by police negotiators (43%) and \nhostage takers (46%), but also by third parties such as friends and relatives (12%).  \nBecause the majority of interaction in the transcripts is between police negotiators and \nhostage takers, we focused our analysis of LSM on these speakers by removing the \ndialogue of third parties.  A description of the scenarios and events that characterized \neach of the nine incidents may be found in the Appendix (see also Taylor, 2002a, pp. 8-9). \nLinguistic Style Matching   11 \nClassification of outcome.  To study the relationship between LSM and \nnegotiation outcome, it was necessary to classify each incident as either successful or \nunsuccessful.  Recognizing that several different strategies can lead to the successful \nresolution of a hostage crisis (e.g., tactical intervention), we based our classification on \nonly the success of the negotiation.  Specifically, in line with previous research (e.g., \nDonohue & Roberto, 1996; Taylor, 2002a), we evaluated whether or not the negotiation \ngenerated a peaceful resolution without making any judgment about the overall success \nof the incident.  This classification was accomplished through a careful analysis of each \ntranscript and through cross-validation with third-party accounts and newspaper reports.  \nOf the 9 negotiation transcripts, 4 were categorized as successful and 5 as unsuccessful.  \nCapturing change over time.  To test whether or not negotiation outcome is \nsystematically related to changes in LSM over time, it was necessary to divide each \nnegotiation into a series of interaction episodes.  Consistent with previous research (e.g., \nDonohue & Roberto, 1996; Rogan & Hammer, 1995), we partitioned each negotiation \ninto six equally-sized periods of interaction.  The use of six periods was determined by \nour desire to allow for the possibility of observing variation in LSM in each of the major \nphases of hostage crises.  Specifically, while there is no absolute agreement about the \nnumber of phases that negotiations move through, most existing accounts incorporate \nthree fundamental phases, with additional divisions appearing as sub-phases of the main \nthree (Holmes, 1992).  This is consistent with Holmes and Sykes\u2019s (1993) analysis of \nhostage negotiations, which found that Gulliver\u2019s three phase model best captured the \ndynamics of the crisis interactions.  Thus, on the basis of Holmes and Sykes\u2019s finding, \nour use of six periods is aimed at enabling two observations of LSM for each of the major \nLinguistic Style Matching   12 \nphases of interaction.  The use of six periods was also methodologically important, since \ndivision of the transcripts into further smaller sections of utterances may have reduce the \nability of the analysis to identify meaningful patterns of change in negotiators\u2019 word use. \nMeasuring Linguistic Style Matching \nDrawing on the work of Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002), we measured LSM \nusing a computer-based text analysis program known as Linguistic Inquiry and Word \nCount (LIWC).  LIWC summarizes linguistic style by measuring the extent to which a \nspeaker uses words associated with a number of psychological and linguistic categories.  \nSpecifically, LIWC analyzes a text file on a word-by-word basis, comparing each word in \nthe file to 2,290 words and word stems in an internal dictionary (Pennebaker, Francis, & \nBooth, 2001).  The words in this dictionary have been rated by judges as representing a \nvariety of different psychological or linguistic categories.  These include standard \nlinguistic categories such as word count, pronouns, and articles, categories relating to \npsychological processes such as affective or emotional, cognitive, and sensory processes, \nand categories that measure references to space, time, and motion.  For any given text \nfile, LIWC calculates the number of words that match each of the categories in the \ndictionary, and then expresses these frequencies as a percentage of the total number of \nwords in the text.  The resulting percentages of occurrence for the dimensions provide a \nsummary or \u201cprofile\u201d of a speaker\u2019s linguistic style.  This profile has been shown to be \nreliable over time and linked to factors such as suicide proneness (Stirman & Pennebaker, \n2001), health behaviors (Pennebaker & King, 1999) and deception (Newman, \nPennebaker, Berry, & Richards, 2003). \nLinguistic Style Matching   13 \nWhile LIWC can calculate scores for more than 70 language categories, we \nfollowed the approach of Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002) and used a subset of 18 \ncategories that have been shown to have good reliability.  Table 1 presents these \ncategories together with a brief description and example words.  We used scores on these \n18 categories to assess the extent of LSM between police negotiators and hostage takers \nin two ways.  Our first approach was to derive an overall evaluation of LSM through a \nbetween-subjects comparison that correlated the scores derived from police negotiators\u2019 \ndialogue to the scores derived form hostage takers\u2019 dialogue.  Specifically, for each \nperiod of each negotiation, we separated the utterances of the police negotiator from the \nutterances of the hostage taker and subjected them to a separate LIWC analysis.  The \nresulting scores provided a profile of that speaker\u2019s word use, and we correlated the two \nprofiles to gain a measure of how well the two speakers\u2019 word use was matched at the \nconversational level. \nOur second approach sought to gain a more specific measure of LSM by \nevaluating how well negotiators synchronized their dialogue over each turn of the \ninteraction.  The focus here was on measuring the extent to which a police negotiator\u2019s \nutterance at, say, Time 1, was matched by what the hostage taker said in response at Time \n1, and also how that response compared to the police negotiators own reply at Time 2.  \nThis turn-by-turn level analysis was achieved by deriving LIWC scores for each utterance \nin the negotiations, which were derived as a proportion of utterance length (rather than \nabsolute occurrence) to take account of variations in the length of each speaker\u2019s turn.  \nThey were then arranged to enable correlations to be computed among scores for adjacent \nutterances.  Specifically, for each of the 18 dimensions, we computed two separate \nLinguistic Style Matching   14 \ncorrelations.  The first was the simple correlation between the utterances of the police \nnegotiator and hostage taker (e.g., utterances at Time 1, utterances at Time 2, etc.).  The \nsecond required lagging the hostage takers statements by one turn, resulting in a \ncorrelation between the hostage takers utterance at Time 1 and the police negotiators \nutterance at Time 2.  These two correlations were then averaged to produce a measure of \nturn-by-turn LSM for each of the linguistic categories. \nNote that any difference between the two turn-by-turn correlations may provide \nsome indication of which of the two negotiators is most likely \u201cleading\u201d the conversation.  \nA speaker who is dominant in an interaction is less likely than a submissive speaker to \nensure that his or her response matches the other party\u2019s cue.  Consequently, the \ncorrelation derived from instances of the dominant speaker responding to the submissive \nspeaker will be lower than the correlation derived from the submissive party responding \nto the dominant speaker.  For example, a relatively higher value for the correlation \nmeasuring hostage taker responses to the police negotiator utterances, when compared \nagainst the correlation for police negotiators responses to the hostage taker utterances, \nwould suggest that the police negotiator has a greater influence or dominance over the \nbehavioral style adopted by the hostage taker.  Because such discrepancies may reveal \nsomething about how LSM emerges between the negotiators, we also report the \nmaximum of the two correlations for each comparison. \nResults \nH1: Linguistic Style Matching and Outcome \nTo test the prediction that greater LSM occurs more in successful negotiated \ncrises, we correlated police negotiator and hostage taker dialogue at both the \nLinguistic Style Matching   15 \nconversational and turn-taking level.  Table 2 shows these correlations across the 18 \nlinguistic dimensions for both the successful and unsuccessful negotiations. Consistent \nwith Hypothesis 1, the correlations associated with successful negotiations are on the \nwhole higher than the correlations associated with unsuccessful negotiations.  \nSpecifically, at the level of whole conversation (column 1 and 4 in Table 2), we found \nevidence of significant LSM in 14 of the 18 linguistic categories for successful \nnegotiations and only 1 of the 18 categories for unsuccessful negotiations.  Unlike \nnegotiators in unsuccessful incidents, negotiators in successful interactions match not \nonly their use of articles, prepositions, and present tense words, but also the extent to \nwhich they match each other\u2019s level of positive emotion, social concern, and use of \ncognitive mechanisms (e.g., exploring causation).  Indeed, the degree of LSM observed \nfor successful cases (mean r = .46) is almost ten times that observed for unsuccessful \ncases (mean r = .05), F(1,34) = 29.43, p < .01, \uf0682 = .48. \nH2: Turn-by-Turn Matching and Negotiation Outcome \nThe mean correlations for the turn-by-turn comparisons are shown in columns \ntwo and five of Table 2. Consistent with Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002), these \ncoefficients are lower in magnitude (but not in significance) than the correlations found \nfor the complete interactions, though they typically remain positive in direction and are \noften significantly greater than zero. As can be seen in Table 2, the difference in turn-by-\nturn LSM across successful and unsuccessful negotiations provides only mixed support \nfor Hypothesis 2. While the successful negotiations showed a greater overall degree of \nturn-by-turn LSM (mean r = .05) compared to the unsuccessful negotiations (mean r \n= .04), the differences at this level are not significant, F(1,34) = .75, ns, and vary \nLinguistic Style Matching   16 \nconsiderably over behavioral category.  Specifically, negotiators in successful incidents \ndemonstrated significant turn-by-turn matching in the length of their utterances (Word \nCount1) and in the way they organized their utterances (Articles and Prepositions).  They \nshowed a significant tendency to mirror one another\u2019s focus on the present (Present tense) \nand they often coordinate their problem solving to focus on causes (Causation) and the \nuncovering of new options and viewpoints (Insight).  They also showed a tendency to \njointly express positive emotion and, to a lesser extent, negative emotion. \nIn contrast, unsuccessful negotiations were associated with synchronized use of \nnegative statements (Negations) and a tendency for negotiators to match each other, both \nin terms of focusing on the past (Past tense) and presenting ideas and viewpoints from the \nfirst person (1st-person singular).  Rather than combine the unveiling of viewpoints with \nefforts to explicate the causes of the conflict, negotiators of unsuccessful incidents \ncombined the unveiling of viewpoints with a tendency to match each other\u2019s recognition \nof differences (Discrepancy). \nTo further explore the mixed support for turn-by-turn matching, we investigated \nthe contribution of each negotiator to the shape of the unfolding interaction.  This was \nachieved by examining the Maximum turn r coefficients (see columns 3 and 6 in Table 2), \nwhich provide an indication of the extent one negotiator was found to imitate the style of \nthe other party across the 18 categories. As might be expected, police negotiators were \nfound to be conversationally dominant over more categories of dialogue in the successful \ncases, whereas hostage takers took the overall more dominant role in defining the style of \nunsuccessful cases.  In the successful cases, the police negotiators played a dominant role \nin instigating positive dialogue.  Hostage takers often reciprocated their focus on the \nLinguistic Style Matching   17 \npresent (Present tense), their discussion of social issues (Social), their use of positive \naffect (Positive emotion), and their focus on problem solving through inclusion, insight \nand causation (Causation, Inclusion, Insight).  In contrast, in the unsuccessful cases the \nhostage taker was dominant.  By using negations (Negations), first person dialogue (First \nperson dialogue), and behaviors that highlight discrepancies and exclusions (Discrepancy, \nExclusion), the hostage taker promoted an interaction style that focused on self-face and \nthe defense of a position. \nH3: Changes in Linguistic Style Matching over Time \nTo test Hypotheses 3 that predicted an increase in LSM over time for successful \nnegotiations, we examined the change in correlations between hostage taker and police \nnegotiator dialogue across the six time periods.  Figure 1 shows the correlations for LSM \nat the conversational level as a function of time period.  An inspection of the upper panel \nin Figure 1 reveals only mixed support for H2a, with only three of the five unsuccessful \ncases associated with a final trend of decreasing LSM over time (i.e., Cases A, B and D).  \nSimilarly, as can be seen from the lower panel of Figure 1, only two out of four \nsuccessful cases were associated with the predicted (H2b) increase in LSM over the final \nstages (Case G and I).  Indeed, there is very little change in LSM over time for any of the \nsuccessful negotiations.  This is in contrast to the unsuccessful negotiations, which, \nwithout exception, are associated with striking oscillations between high and low levels \nof LSM across time.  To further examine this difference in LSM variation, we divided the \nstandard deviation of each negotiation\u2019s mean LSM scores by the mean LSM score to \nderive a coefficient of variation (Howell, 1997). The resulting average coefficient of \nLinguistic Style Matching   18 \nvariation for unsuccessful negotiations (CV = .13) was almost three times the magnitude \nof the average coefficient of variation for the successful negotiations (CV = .05). \nDiscussion \nConflict researchers have long sought to understand how the ebb-and-flow of \ncommunicative interaction shapes the outcome of a negotiation.  Our findings suggest \nthat this ebb-and-flow occurs at the remarkably basic level of negotiators\u2019 language use.  \nIn line with Niederhoffer and Pennebaker (2002), we found convincing differences in the \nextent to which negotiators coordinate their linguistic style (i.e., use of different classes \nof words) in successful and unsuccessful negotiations.  Not only were successful \nnegotiations associated with higher aggregate levels of matched linguistic style, they \nwere also associated with quite different patterns of style matching at the level of cues \nand responses.  The negotiation dance, it seems, occurs not only at the level of \ninstrumental exchanges and relational dynamics, but also at the level of language use. \nNegotiators engage in what might be called a \u201clinguistic dance\u201d. \nIn line with a growing number of studies (Olekalns, Brett, & Weingart, 2003; \nTaylor & Donald, 2007), we sought a comprehensive picture of linguistic style matching \n(LSM) by consider patterns of behavior at both a conversational (macro) and turn-taking \n(micro) level. We consider these two levels of the negotiation process in turn. \nConversational Linguistic Style Matching \nAt the conversational level, we found significant support for our hypothesis (H1) \nthat negotiators would show greater levels of linguistic style matching in successful \nnegotiations compared to unsuccessful negotiations.  This difference in matching \nencompassed all the dimensions of language we examined, suggesting that successful \nLinguistic Style Matching   19 \nnegotiators develop and maintain a mutual interdependence or coordination of their \ninteraction that subsumes problem solving style (e.g., insights, discrepancies), \ninterpersonal thoughts (e.g., causations), and expressions of emotion.  If the police \nnegotiator interacted in short, positive bursts, then the hostage taker tended to follow suit.  \nIf the police negotiators\u2019 utterances emphasized concrete thinking (e.g., articles) or \nsentence complexity (e.g., prepositions), then this emphasis was often matched by the \nhostage taker.  In sum, negotiators in successful cases were able to establish a common, \nmutually reinforcing way of interacting and perceiving the various issues of the conflict.  \nThey were able to find a common framing of the conflict (Rogan & Hammer, 2002), \nwhich allowed them to develop interdependence (Donohue, 2002) and take up a form of \nnormative, adaptive problem solving (Taylor, 2002b).  Such synchrony in interpersonal \nperspectives simply did not occur in unsuccessful negotiations. \nTurn-by-turn Linguistic Style Matching \nAt a micro turn-by-turn level, we found a complex but organized set of \ndifferences in the type of behaviors associated with style matching across successful and \nunsuccessful negotiations.  Specifically, the concentration of LSM during successful \nnegotiations was around mutual turn taking, the extent of concrete thinking, the \nexpression of positive emotions, a focus on present rather than past, and on the search for \nalternatives.  In contrast, LSM in unsuccessful negotiations was characterized by a set of \nbehaviors that might readily be associated with conflict spiraling (Holmes & Fletcher-\nBergland, 1995).  Behaviors included the reciprocation of negations, expressions of \nnegative emotions, and a focus on the discrepancies between positions.  What these \nresults suggest (tentatively given the small amount of data examined) is that successful \nLinguistic Style Matching   20 \nand unsuccessful negotiations are not differentiated by differences in the degree to which \na hostage taker or police negotiator engages in the interaction, as suggested by the \ncoordination engagement hypothesis (Niederhoffer & Pennebaker, 2002).  Rather, the \ndistinction between successful and unsuccessful negotiations comes from differences in \ntype of conversational engagement, with negotiators adopting a principally distributive or \nintegrative language (Putnam, 1990). \nSo what determines the linguistic style that dominates a negotiation?  This \nquestion was partly answered by our analysis of conversational dominance, where we \nfound that police negotiators dictated the hostage takers responses in successful cases, but \nthat the hostage takers were dominant in dictating the dialogue of unsuccessful cases.  Of \nparticular interest here is that speakers\u2019 dominance was not found to be universal across \nall facets of dialogue, as is often conceptualized by theory (Gottman & Notarius, 2000).  \nRather, the dominance asserted by police negotiators and hostage takers was specific to \nparticular categories of dialogue, and in some cases co-occurred with instances of the \nother party dominating a different aspect of the dialogue.  Dominance is thus a subtler \nphenomenon than traditionally conceptualized, and uncovering how it can differ in extent \nand quality should go some way to helping us understand role dynamics in conflict \n(Taylor & Donald, 2007).  Perhaps more important, however, is identifying how a \nnegotiator is able to take up the dominant position within an interaction.  A detailed look \nat the turn-by-turn correlations over time should provide some insight into how \ndominance emerges over the initial period of interaction.  This aspect of theory \ndevelopment should be of particular interest to crisis negotiators and their trainers given \nLinguistic Style Matching   21 \nthe impact that dominance had on the quality and eventual outcome of the examined \nnegotiations. \nChanges in Linguistic Style Matching over Time \nBy examining LSM over six time stages of the negotiation, we were able to \nexplore why there were dramatic differences in LSM across successful and unsuccessful \nnegotiations.  In contrast to our predictions (H3a and H3b), we found no evidence to \nsuggest the differences in LSM were the result of successful negotiations being \nassociated with an increase in synchrony over time.  Rather, the differences were almost \nexclusively related to differences in the consistency of LSM, with unsuccessful \nnegotiations associated with dramatic changes in the level of LSM over time compared to \nsuccessful negotiations.  One attractive explanation for this contrasting patterning of \nLSM across successful and unsuccessful negotiations may be found in relational order \ntheory (Donohue, 2001).  This theory views oscillations in interpersonal dynamics as the \nresult of negotiators switching between periods of asserting power (moving against) and \ndeveloping affiliation (moving towards)(Donohue & Hoobler, 2002; Donohue & Roberto, \n1993).  Periods of low LSM may arguably be occurring as one negotiator tries to assert \nhis or her power over the interaction, which forced the other to defend his or her position.  \nStyles increase in consistency when negotiators move away from relational tensions and \njointly focus on resolving the substantive problem (Donohue & Taylor, 2003). \nConclusions \nThe analysis presented in this paper examines a small set of crisis negotiations, \nbut the potential application of LSM in research is much wider.  In the experimental \ncontext, LSM may provide a proxy measure for dynamics such as mimicry (Curhan & \nLinguistic Style Matching   22 \nPentland, 2007) or entrainment (Taylor, 2002b), while particular dimensions may provide \na way to measure latent constructs such as degree of positive affect or level of trust.  \nUsing linguistic style to make such measurements has the advantage of being non-\ndisruptive and potentially less open to the biases of self-reporting (e.g., in post-\nnegotiation questionnaires).  Similarly, in the applied context, LSM may provide a \nmeasure of micro-level dynamics that can be compared against macro-level changes in \nthe negotiation conditions.  For example, it may be possible to link the degree of LSM in \nbilateral talks across nations with the subsequent cooperative or competitive behaviors of \nthose nations (Donohue & Hoobler, 2002; Druckman, 1986; 2001).  Identifying such \nassociations will add value to efforts to unpack the processes that underlie and give rise \nto the trajectory and ultimate outcome of such negotiations. \nIn the grand scheme of things, what does a measure of LSM using word counts \nprovide the practicing negotiator?  The skeptic might argue that the current results show \nempirically what negotiators have long observed, namely, that there often exists a high \ndegree of coordination and reciprocation in negotiation \u201cmoves,\u201d and that this \ncoordination allows a negotiation to begin, unfold and resolve.  However, the direct way \nin which measuring LSM captured the unfolding path of interpersonal exchanges has \nimportant applications.  First, LSM and successful negotiation outcomes were associated \nwith a particular use of words and word patterns, which may be integrated into \nnegotiation strategies and taught as specific examples of good practice.  Second, as \nargued by Pennebaker and King (1999), individuals vary widely in their communicative \nstyle, and LSM may represent, when compared to self-report, a more sensitive way of \nmeasuring an individual\u2019s capacity for engaging with or dominating an opposing \nLinguistic Style Matching   23 \nnegotiator.  Finally, following recent developments in automated transcription, it may be \npossible to incorporate a computerized LSM measure into a decision support tool.  In \nextreme conflict environments such as hostage crises, methods that allow for meaningful \ntracking and assessment of a negotiation\u2019s progress are rare and much needed. \n \n \nLinguistic Style Matching   24 \nReferences \nAuld, F., & White, A.
