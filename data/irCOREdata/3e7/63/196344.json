Doi: 10.4049\/jimmunol.0900666Metadata only entryThe classical and lectin pathways of complement activation neutralize pathogens and stimulate key immunological processes. Both pathways are initiated by collagen-containing, soluble pattern recognition molecules associated with specific serine proteases. In the classical pathway, C1q binds to Ab-Ag complexes or bacterial surfaces to activate C1r and C1s. In the lectin pathway, mannan-binding lectin and ficolins bind to carbohydrates on pathogens to activate mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease 2. To characterize the interactions leading to classical pathway activation, we have analyzed binding between human C1q, C1r, and C1s, which associate to form C1, using full-length and truncated protease components. We show that C1r and C1s bind to C1q independently. The CUB1-epidermal growth factor fragments contribute most toward binding, but CUB2 of C1r, but not of C1s, is also important. Each C1rs tetramer presents a total of six binding sites, one for each of the collagenous domains of C1q. We also demonstrate that subcomponents of the lectin and classical pathways cross-interact. Thus, although the stoichiometries of complexes differ, interactions are analogous, with equivalent contacts between recognition and protease subcomponents.
