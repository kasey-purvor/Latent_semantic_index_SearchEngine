INTRODUCTION\nMolecular conductors are of great interest from both a theo-\nretical and an applied electronics point of view in extending the\nSIA roadmap [1]. Due to recent success in measuring the I\u2212V\ncharacteristics of individual or small groups of molecules,\ndeveloping and controlling electronic molecules that can serve\nas the active elements in future nano-electronic circuits has\nbecome a current objective in this field [2], [3]. Although\ndeveloping a reliable molecular-electronics device still has\nmany key problems such as device stability, reproducibility\nand the effective control of single-molecule transport, many\nresearch groups have begun to examine possible system archi-\ntectures which can use these devices to their best advantage\n[4], [5], [6]. However, the current passing through these\nmolecular electronic devices is a highly nonlinear function of\napplied bias voltage and its detailed physics-based description\nis computationally very complex. The complexity of solving\nfor currents and voltages is prohibitively high if many devices\nare combined in interconnected functional structures [7], [8].\nConventional CMOS devices on the other hand are supported\nby a hierarchy of models of varying degrees of sophistication\nthat allow the circuit designer to trade-off accuracy for run\ntime, allowing efficient simulation of complex circuits. Hence\ndeveloping a hierarchy of device and interconnect models and\nan efficient simulation methodology is a key step in exploring\nthe system capabilities of molecular device based circuits, as\npart of the search for miniaturization of devices beyond the\nend of the SIA roadmap[1].\nRecently, quantum-mechanical results obtained with first-\nprinciple methods have been used to construct an efficient\ndevice-level model of prototype molecular electronic devices\n[9], [10], such as the benzene-1,4-dithiol (BDT) molecule\nbridging a break junction in a gold wire [11]. This model\nexpressed in terms of the BW formula, takes into account\nonly the coupling between the molecule and the contacts, the\nenergy levels of the molecule, and an estimate of the single-\nelectron charging energy for the molecule. We have used this\nmodel in the past to explore suitable system architectures for\ncombining molecular devices in functional electronic circuits\n[12], [13]. In this paper, we propose an extension of this model\nthat describes the dynamic behavior of the device and investi-\ngate the potential performance impact that general molecular\nelectronics device technology could have on Very Large Scale\nIntegration (VLSI) circuit applications. We demonstrate digital\nfunctionality for a cross-bar architecture with the molecu-\nlar devices as active elements. The connection between the\nquantum mechanical physics of the device and the high-\nlevel behavior of a circuit is established through dependence\nof these metrics on fundamental physical quantities such as\nPlanck\u2019s constant and electron charge. In this article attention\nis drawn to design considerations in a likely architecture, as\nwell as the qualitative aspects of the effect of the variation of\nthese quantities on circuit behavior.\nII. DEVICE MODEL\nA. Static Behavior\nThe transmitted current I through the metal-molecule-metal\njunction is proportional to the transmission probability T (E)\ndescribing the ease with which electrons can scatter through\nthe molecule from the source lead into the drain lead for\na range of energy levels around the Fermi energy of the\nleads. When connecting the molecule to metallic contacts, the\ndiscrete molecular levels broaden into quasicontinuum levels\ndue to hybridization with the metal Fermi-energy. The current\nis computed using [14]\nI(V ) =\n2e\nh\n\u222b\n\u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndET (E)(\n1\nexp[E \u2212 \u03bcs]\/kT + 1\n\u2212\n1\nexp[E \u2212 \u03bcd]\/kT + 1\n) (1)\nwhere e is the electron charge and h is Planck\u2019s constant.\nFor symmetric molecules, the two electro-chemical potentials\n\u03bcs and \u03bcd (refering to the source and drain respectively) are\ndefined to be \u03bcs = Ef + eV\/2; \u03bcd = Ef \u2212 eV\/2, where\nV is the bias voltage applied between the source and drain,\nand Ef is the Fermi energy for the contacts. In the case of\nweak molecule-electrode coupling, due to the weak interaction\nbetween the leads and the molecule, the broadening of the\nlevels is much less than the separation between the levels.\nUnder this assumption, it is well known that the transmission\n978-1-4244-3828-0\/09\/$25.00 \u00a92009 IEEE 1819\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Enhanced molecular device model and dynamic behaviour\nprobability can be approximated by the Breit-Wigner (BW)\nformula [15], [16]\nT (E) =\n4\u0393\n1\n\u0393\n2\n(E \u2212 \u0002\n0\n)2 + (\u0393\n1\n+ \u0393\n2\n)2\n(2)\nwhere the variables \u0393\n1\nand \u0393\n2\nrepresent the broadenings of\nmolecular levels by hybridization with the contacts and the\nmolecular level \u0002\n0\nis related to the intrinsic chemistry of\nthe molecule. Depending on the strength of the electronic\ncoupling between the substrate and the molecule, the transport\nmechanism proves to be very different. \u0393 can be tabulated\nfor a given molecule embedded between different types of\nelectrodes with different configuration structures. A plot of this\nprobability and corresponding I-V characteristics calculated\nusing Eq.(1) is given in Fig.(1). This model agrees quite well\nwith ab initio results.\nB. Dynamic Behavior\nFor the purpose of circuit performance investigation, the\nknowledge of the time constant related to the physical descrip-\ntion of the device is sufficient for its dynamic characterization.\nThis time constant can be estimated by calculating the differ-\nence between the time spent by the electron in the region of\nthe scattering interaction and the time spent in the same region\nin the absence of the scattering interaction. The delay time of\na single device may be relatively very small, on the order of\nfs. However calculating this delay accurately is still critical\nin designing functional synchronous systems. The event of\nscattering is described using the scattering matrix S(E) [17].\nS(E) is unitary and can be written as S(E) = exp(2i\u03b4),\nwhere \u03b4(E) = \u2212i log S(E) is the scattering phase shift.\nFor narrow isolated resonance with a single open channel,\n\u03b4(E) may be parameterized in terms of the resonance po-\nsition \u0002\n0\nand width \u0393\n1\n+ \u0393\n2\nby the BW one-level formula\ntan[\u03b4(E)] = \u2212 (\u03931+\u03932)\/2\nE\u2212\u0002\n0\n[15]. The definition of the phase\nshift \u03b4(E) has a very intuitive physical meaning, as it is\nrelated to the Wigner delay time \u03c4 which is the additional\ntime spent in the scattering process compared to free motion\nby \u03c4 \u00d7 | (\u03931+\u03932)\nE\u2212\u0002\n0\n+i(\u0393\n1\n+\u0393\n2\n)\/2\n|\n2 = 2h\u00af(d\u03b4\/dE).\nHence under the weak coupling condition, the time constant\nof the molecular device model is expressed as \u03c4 = h\u00af\n\u0393\n1\n+\u0393\n2\nwhen E = \u0002\n0\n. We propose to use this time constant to describe\nthe dynamic behavior of the device, specifically to model the\nresponse time required by the device to reach 63.2% of the\nthreshold voltage for a step input. Hence the complete model\nfor the device leads to a three terminal equivalent circuit shown\nin Fig.2a where the third terminal is qualitatively equivalent\nto the body terminal in a MOSFET, and the main current\nproviding path is drain to source, with a forward characteristic\nequivalent to a complex diode having an I-V characteristic\ngiven by the BW model. The full device characteristic is given\nby,\nIDS(t) = I0(1\u2212 exp(\u2212t\/\u03c4d)) (3)\nwhere I\n0\nis the pulse amplitude calculated using the static\nmodel for a given voltage.The third terminal can potentially be\nconnected to any voltage, but in a two-terminal configuration\nis implicitly connected to signal ground. The rise times for\nvoltage step responses are in the scale of fS and shown in\nFig.2b.\nIII. DEMONSTRATION OF DIGITAL FUNCTIONALITIES\nThe model proposed in Sec.II can be used to describe\ntwo terminal symmetric devices using resonant tunneling\nas a conduction mechanism. The device models have been\nimplemented using the analog hardware description language\nVerilogA, allowing arbitrary circuit configurations to be sim-\nulated for static and dynamic behavior within the analog\nand mixed-signal simulation environment from Cadence. The\nmost promising architecture for 2 terminal nano device based\nsystems based on fabrication considerations [4] is a Pro-\ngrammable Logic Array (PLA) type structure, with horizontal\nand vertical nanowires on different planes, and connetivity\nbetween planes achieved by the nano devices. In this case,\neach junction consists of an extended molecule sandwiched\nbetween metal electrodes. As the symmetry of the device\nallows current to flow in both directions some restrictions on\ndesign style and limitations on the noise margin are imposed.\nTo examine these considerations and the viability of such\ncircuits in VLSI applications, two representative gates (AND,\nOR) were constructed (Fig.3a) and simulated.\nDesign considerations for the gates can be divided into\noptimisation of static and dynamic metrics.

The basic requirement on the dc output\nvoltages is that the lowest high voltage be significantly higher\nthan the equivalent thermal noise related voltage at the oper-\nating temperature, around 20mV at room temperature for an\nestimated load capacitance of 10aF from V 2outCload \u0002 KBT .\nThis requirement governs the choice of Rp, as for a given Vdd,\nhaving a very large Rp maximises the value for an input of\n\u201c11\u201d. However Rp also needs to be sufficiently low so that for\nan input of \u201c10\u201d or \u201c01\u201d a large enough separation is achieved\nbetween the low output of the AND gate and the high output\nof the OR gate. Fig.3b shows this separation between logic\nlevels as a function of Rp, showing the value that maximises\nnoise margin. Fig.3c gives the ideal logic levels for these two\ngates when the optimal values for Rp was used.\nIn this PLA type architecture, the general form of a gate\nis a complex network of molecules with pull-up and pull-\ndown resistors, where the input vector is on the row wires\nand the output is presented vertically on the column wires.\nThe schematic of Fig.4 illustrates this general structure in\nthe form of a two-input AND gate, with the simulated truth\ntable in Fig 4b. A useful analyis can be carried out by\nconsidering each molecular device as an equivalent resistance,\nand characterising the gate by an output impedance. Such an\napproach provides both design insight, as well as allowing for\nthe investigation of the effect of statistical variation on circuit\nmetrics, as we demonstrate below.\nThe equivalent resistances of these molecular devices de-\npend on applied voltages and are defined as the slope of the\nI \u2212 V graph at a particular point: RA,B,C = dV\/dI . The I-V\ncharacteristic of the device shows that within a limited region\nof applied voltage, the resistances of the devices do not change\nmuch. For \u0393 = 0.3 and \u0002\n0\n= 1.25 , the resistance of each\ndevice for different input patterns are given in Table I.

The\napproximation is due to the fact that Rup,down \u0002 RA,B,C ,\nand a further simplification Zout \u2248 3R\/2 is made possible\nby recognising that RA \u2248 RB \u2248 RC \u2248 R. One of the\nfundamental dynamic metrics is delay, and the enhanced BW\nbased model allows the gate delay to be accurately calculated.\nIt turns out that in comparison with any significant load\ncapacitance, the effective internal capacitance is negligibly\nsmall, and the delay time \u03c4g of the gate is a function of the\noutput impedance and load capacitance \u03c4g = ZoutCload. The\naccuracy of this analysis is confirmed by the simulation results\nof Table I, with a very close match between the estimated and\nsimulated values for Zout as well as gate delay. Hence it can\nbe said that for this particular gate, the delay depends only on\nthe effective resistance of the device.\nIV. STATISTICAL TREATMENT\nDue to the inherently poor control over nano-fabrication\ntechniques, it is difficult to form identical molecular junctions.\nHence the fundamental physical constants of \u0393 and \u0002\n0\ncan be\nexpected to vary over a range, and it is necessary to be able to\npredict the behaviour of a system under such conditions. The\nabstract model proposed in the paper allows such predictions\nby enabling circuit-level Monte Carlo simulations, greatly\n1821\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The basic premise of this\nmethodology is as follows. Both \u0393 = \u0393\n1\n= \u0393\n2\nand \u0002\n0\ncan\nbe calculated by using first-principle calculations for a given\nsystem, where \u0393 is related to the imaginary part of the self-\nenergies, and \u0002\n0\nis related to the molecule energy level \u0002mol\nprincipally, as well as the self-energies [6]. A case of special\ninterest occurs when the quantities \u0002\n0\nand \u0393 of each device\nare related to a single random number \u03b5r for that device, as\n\u0393 = \u0393\n0\n+ A\u03b5r and \u00020 = \u0002mol + B\u03b5r. The quantities A and\nB are constants, and \u03b5r are independent identically distributed\nrandom variables with mean value zero. The mean values of \u0002\n0\nand \u0393 are thus \u0002mol and \u03930. Example probability distributions\nfor \u0002\n0\nand \u0393 are 0.5eV < \u0002\n0\n< 2.25eV and 0.05eV <\n\u0393 < 0.55eV respectively. A histogram of the device resistance\nobtained from Monte Carlo simulations with bias voltages\nranging from 0.5 \u2212 5.5V is shown in Fig. 5. When the bias\nvoltage was increased to around 4V , the resistance reached its\nlowest value with \u03bc = 52.683k\u03a9. The last subfigure in Fig.\n5 shows the mean values of the resistance at different bias\npoints. Given the statistical variation of the device resistance,\nit is now straightforward to calculate the statistical spread\nof the gate delay using the same approximation as for the\npoint case. This is compared with the simulated results for\nthe delay distribution in Fig.6, showing a good match. The\nfurther abstraction of the gate as an equivalent impedance is\nthus able to offer a massive reduction in the simulation time of\ncircuits involving millions of such molecular electronic gates.\nThe simulations also show that the gate level implementation\nis relatively robust in the face of significant statistical variation\nin device parameters\nV. CONCLUSION\nAn abstract representation of molecular electronic digital\ngates based on an enhanced BW model has been presented.\nUsing this abstract model, the viability of molecular elctronics\nbased applications has been explored, and a method of design-\ning diverse functional gates demonstrated. It is also shown\nhow the abstract characterisation permits the investigation of\nthe effect of statistical spread inherent in fundamental device\na b\nFig. 6. the density distribution for simulated and calculated delay time\nparameters on canonical digital metrics, by greatly reducing\nthe computational complexity of a transient simulation.
