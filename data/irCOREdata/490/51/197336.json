Although contemporary political systems often \nposit responsibility and care within the context of individuated and autonomous \nselves, geographers have done much to relocate responsibility and care within \nnarratives of interdependency \u2013 spatially and temporally. They have argued that both \nterms offer a route for thinking about ethical geographical relations between myriad \nplaces. In this article we take this project further, by looking at how the nature and \nshape of these relationships might be construed in a postcolonial world. We suggest \nthat, through a more critical engagement with postcolonial thinking, any exploration \nof existing practices of responsibility and care will not only reveal the enormous \npotential of imagining these geographies as forms of existing and evolving \nrelationalities, but will also lead us to interrogate the deployments of these terms in \nthe context of past and present inequalities. We show that routing care and \nresponsibility through postcolonial geographies moves us towards a more pragmatic \nresponsiveness, one that involves a \u2017care-full\u2018 recognition of postcolonial interaction.  \n \nKeywords: care, responsibility, postcolonialism \n 2 \nIntroduction \nIn recent years geographers have shown considerable interest in notions of \nresponsibility and care and how they can help to move us towards a more ethical \ngeography (Lawson, 2007; Massey, 2004; Popke, 2007; Sparke, 2007a). Through \ntheir ability to emphasise relationality and interdependence, these concepts of care \nand responsibility challenge wider moves within public policy towards an \nautonomous, responsibilised self (Clarke, 2005). Thus a range of writers have \ncontested such individualised versions of care and responsibility by highlighting the \ninherently relational interdependence that marks the globalising world (Bosco, 2007; \nCupples et al, 2007; Jazeel, 2007). In so doing, notions of responsibility and care are \nmapped onto a framework for ethical living. \n \nIn this introduction to the special issue and overview of the literature, we outline some \nof the ways in which geographers have written about these interdependencies of \nresponsibility and care and the spatial and place based relations within which they are \nembedded\n1\n. We then move towards thinking through how the accepted temporal and \nspatial frames in which responsibility and care are usually imagined in the \ngeographical literature may be extended by routing them through the imperatives of a \npostcolonial world. In this venture we contribute to other attempts to nuance \nunderstandings of responsibility and care within geography. For instance, a recent \nspecial issue on geographies of generosity (Geoforum 2007, 38) takes as its starting \npoint a critique of the politico-moral underpinnings of responsibility and care as calls \nto political action. Barnett and Land (2007, p.1073) argue convincingly that \ngeographies of care and responsibility over distance are linked by a similar \n\u2017wrongheadedness\u2018 about motivations to political action. They suggest that \n 3 \nformulations of geographies of care often start from the assumption that relatively \nprivileged people do not care about \u2017distant strangers\u2018 and should be made to care \nthrough reasoned arguments, whilst geographies of responsibility often assume that \nrevealing causal links between the actions of relatively privileged people and the \nsuffering experienced by many others globally will lead to a greater sense of political \nresponsibility.  They argue the partiality inherent in caring and responsible relations \nshould be seen not as a flaw or shortcoming but as the condition of ethical relations. \nMoreover, they emphasise the nature of power relations involved in such \ninterdependent relations, taking us some way towards a postcolonial reading of care \nand responsibility. Towards this, Barnett and Land (2007, p.1073) suggest \u2017the \nadoption of a less exhortatory, more exploratory\u2018 programme of research around the \neveryday practices of caring and responsiveness.  \n \nThis special issue on \u2017Postcoloniality, responsibility and care\u2018 aims to focus on these \neveryday practices in order to take questions of responsibility and care in yet another \ndirection.  And although we agree with Barnett and Land (2007) that responsibility \nand care are useful notions for invigorating and shaping political practice, we suggest \nthat a more critical engagement with postcolonial thinking will reveal not only the \nintimacies and generosities within existing practices of care and responsibility, but \nalso expose their political contestations and the pain and the absences that underpin \nglobal relationships touched by histories of (post)colonisation, exploitation and \ninequality. Hence our aim in this special issue is not to jettison geographies of \nresponsibility and care, but to urge geographers to explore both the enormous \npotential of imagining these geographies as forms of existing and evolving \nrelationality, and also to continually interrogate the deployments of these terms in the \n 4 \ncontext of the complex spatial matrices and (dis)connectivities that are central to a \npostcolonial world. This deliberate re-placing of theoretical geographies of \nresponsibility and care within postcolonial relationalities continues the postcolonial \nmethod elaborated in a previous publication (see Raghuram and Madge, 2006, p. 279-\n80).  \n \nThe potentialities and the limits to responsibility and care as viewed through a \npostcolonial frame will be explored in this article through five moves. Following this \nfirst introductory section, in the second section, we provide a schematic overview of \nsome of the geographical literature on care, while the third section offers a brief \noutline of some of the literature on responsibility within geography. This moves us to \nsummarise in our fourth section three ways in which a postcolonial reading might \npresent an insistent challenge to current geographical literature on responsibility and \ncare: through complicating ideas of proximate and distant relations; by rethinking the \nframe of temporality; and in questioning the centre from which care and responsibility \ncan be talked about. In doing so, we argue that geographers must interrogate the \nmultiple historical materiality of spatial relationships, expressing these as \ngeographically-routed power dynamics, and use this understanding to both explore \nand generate forms of engaged pragmatic responsiveness. The fifth section offers a \nbrief conclusion as well as an introduction to the papers and themes explored in this \nspecial issue.  \n \nGeographies of care \nIn the past few years there has been growing academic interest in geographies of care \n(see for instance Social and Cultural Geography 2003, 2004; Environment and \n 5 \nPlanning A 2003).  Increasing concern over how to think ethically and act responsibly \nin an interconnected world has led to much discussion of how such an ethical \nresponsibility can be enacted both towards those who are in close proximity as well as \ntowards those who are spatially distant (Silk, 2004).  The notion of care offers an \naffective register to this discussion and also locates this responsibility in embodied \nenactments of care. It thus offers academics a mode of invocation for responsibility \nthat draws on proximate relations, but makes these phenomenological experiences of \ncare available for projecting out to distant relations and responsibilities. In picking up \ninterest in questions of care, the geographical literature focuses on three key bodies of \nwork: ethical spatial relations; how care is stretched across space in different ways; \nand the spatial (re)arrangements involved in care-giving and care-receiving. These \nthree themes are outlined below. \n \nEthical spatial relations  \nAlthough there is a large literature on care in a range of disciplines, focusing on \ndifferent forms that care-giving and care-receiving may take based on variations in the \nmarket (unpaid, unpaid subsistence, informal market work, paid), characteristics of \nthe labour process (direct care, indirect care) and kinds of beneficiaries (child, sick, \ndisabled, able-bodied adult, self) (Folbre, 2006), it is the inherent spatiality of care \nand the ongoing redistribution of care across places and spaces that have been the \nfocus of  the geographical literature on care. Thus, in a wide-ranging overview, Popke \n(2006) outlines some ways in which geographical literature has found the concept of \ncare useful for evoking ethical spatial relations in a number of sites, through different \npractices and at different levels of abstraction. Concerns over people and place in \ncare-giving practices are central to this strand of work (Milligan, 2003). There is a \n 6 \nlarge emphasis on caring for the elderly (Milligan, 2003), ill, disabled (Hughes et al., \n2005), homeless (Johnsen et al., 2005) and children, and on care-giving in a number \nof sites such as the home, community drop-in centres (Conradson, 2003), hospices \n(Brown, 2003) and hospitals (Fannin, 2003). This view of care draws on, and \ncontributes to, insights in health geographies (Parr, 2003) as detailed ethnographic \nwork explores how such care is mediated in particular socio-economic settings. \nHowever, place does not simply provide a background in which caring is enacted. \nRather, as Bondi (2003) suggests, care is a quality of spaces that are produced \nrelationally. Thus in her analysis of counselling she shows that training counsellors to \ncare for their clients is ultimately also about creating spaces of care.  \n \nMany of these studies on ethical spatial relations focus on individuals who require \ncare because of disability, ill-health, or due to their age and their relationships with \ncarers who are largely seen as responsible, autonomous subjects. In these accounts the \ncare needs of the carer and the cared-for are held distinctively apart as care flows out \nfrom the care-giver to the care-receiver, each constituted as distinct subjects. Moral \nagency usually lies with the carer although it is always produced in relation to those \nwho are cared for. The ethics of relationality lie in making this carework as effective \nand responsible as possible. We are urged to be responsible enough to care, and to \ncare well\n2\n.  \n \nHow care is stretched across space in different ways \nGeographical research has also explored the ways in which this care is stretched \nacross space in different ways. Thus, authors contributing to a special issue in Social \nand Cultural Geography (2004) on caring at a distance highlight the ways in which \n 7 \ncare flows out from the global North to the South. They focus on how care is enacted \nwithin the discursive frameworks of much development literature. Although some \nauthors (see for example, Silk, 2004) suggest that this is only one side of a complex \nequation of care, i.e. that care may be extended both across the South and from South \nto North (Kofman and Raghuram, 2007), the underlying theme remains that the virtue \nof care can be expanded out from interpersonal, proximate relations towards those \nwhom one may not personally know. This relation of care underpins an ethic of \nresponsibility in an interdependent world. Silk (2004) suggests that one way of \nthinking about such care is through embodied acts, the myriad daily practices, through \nwhich care is performed. Ethical consumption - the purchase of ethical goods for \nconsumption by the self or as gifts to proximate others - may be seen as one way of \nparticipating in these \u2017caringscapes\u2018 (McKie et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2007). Here \ncare for distant others is being enacted through care of the intimate other or care of the \nself. \n \nThe spatial (re)arrangements involved in care-giving and care-receiving \nThe spatial (re)arrangements involved in care-giving and care-receiving too have \nreceived considerable attention from geographers. The relocation of care from the \nprivate to the public sphere (see Sevenhuijsen, 2003) and back again have called forth \ndifferent forms of regulation and emotive and political responses. A range of social \nchanges, especially changing family forms and nature of provisioning within welfare \nstates (Staeheli and Brown, 2003), had meant that in the recent past more and more \ncarework was being performed in public spaces such as old-age homes, nurseries and \nhospices rather than within the household. However, recent shifts in the welfare state \nhave led to a reprivatisation of significant parts of this provision in many countries. In \n 8 \nthe welfare states of Northern and Western Europe public welfare provision has \nshrunk so that families increasingly have to resort to private solutions to what had \nbriefly been scripted as a public issue (Ungerson, 1999; Ungerson and Yeandle, \n2007). In the U.K., the mode of public provisioning has also altered as those who \nneed care are now required to select and arrange for their own care for which the \ngovernment then repays them through the direct payment scheme. This effectively \nlocates those who require care as responsible, active citizens but it also alters the \nnature of the relationship between the carer and the cared-for by making the latter the \nentrepreneurial employers of the former. It takes the individualisation and \ncommodification of care inside the home in new directions. Thus, just as nannies at \nhome are replacing formalised publicly provided childcare, so too are private \nindividuals replacing state-employed care assistants (see for instance Ilcan et al., \n2007; McDowell, 2004; Staeheli and Brown, 2003). Having escaped the domestic \nterrain, the terms and quality of care have become the subject of calculative processes \nand regulations that are characteristic of the public sphere and in the most recent \nround of  redomestication of care, these processes have also moved back \u2017home\u2018. The \ncaricature of the \u2017nanny state\u2018 expresses some of the discontent around the shifts in \nthe adjudicative boundary between the private and the public that are being played out \nin these complex relocations of care. \n \nThese rearrangements also increasingly stretch out across the globe. The growth of \nthe two wage family, underlain by a shift in welfare policies from the family wage to \nadult worker model, has catapulted more and more women into the workplace and has \nled to a care deficit in some households which is then filled in the care chain through \n\u2017a series of personal links between people across the globe based on the paid or \n 9 \nunpaid work of caring\u2018 (Hochschild, 2000, p.131). Drawing on Parre\u00f1as\u2018s work \n(2000, 2001) on migration of nannies from the Philippines to the U.S., Arlie \nHochschild (2000) argues that such migration simply transfers the care deficit from \nhouseholds in the U.S. to households in the Philippines. The next link in the chain is \ngenerated when this mobility then sparks further mobility, as women move from \npoorer parts of the Philippines to look after the families of these international \nmigrants. Yeates (2004) usefully compares these chains to the links that make up the \ncommodity chain. In conjunction with the wider feminist literature, much of this \ndebate also focuses on how we look after the carers in our society more effectively \nand suggests that one way to do this is to revalue care (Kofman and Raghuram, 2006; \nRazavi, 2007). \n \nHowever, in thinking about caring relations, whether near or far, much of the \nliterature in geography reviewed above is embedded in a call to care where care is \nposited as normatively \u2017good\u2018 and based on an unproblematic assumption of \u2017need\u2018 \nwhich invokes \u2017an asymmetrical orientation towards the other\u2018 (Cooper, 2007, p.244). \nThus according to Beasley and Bacchi (2007, p. 283, 285), the hierarchical nature of \nmany caring relationships goes almost unnoticed and much of the literature \npresupposes relations of dependence and vulnerability. Moreover, the analytical focus \nof much of the literature on caring activities, concepts and models has been limited to \nstates in the global North (Esping-Anderson, 1999). There is also increasing \nrecognition of limitations of care as a concept for the global South and of the need to \nunderstand both overarching global processes and the heterogeneous local \narrangements involved in procuring care (Kofman and Raghuram, 2007) while \nattempting to theorise care arrangements in the South. However, despite these \n 10 \nlimitations, the ability to bring together emotive, moral and political registers has \nmeant that care does offer a route into thinking ethically about relationships between \nself and others \u2013 both proximate and distant. It therefore claims to offer much to \ngeographical thinking. So too has the responsibility literature claimed to offer much to \ngeographical thinking, as outlined below. \n \nGeographies of Responsibility  \nResponsibility is another term that has gained wide currency within geography with \nthe special issue of Geografisker Annaler B (2004) entitled Geographies of \nResponsibility being cited as a significant intervention in the field. The articles in this \ncollection offer a sustained engagement with the political implications of conceiving \nglobal responsibility as embedded within the \u2017power-geometries\u2018 of relational space. \nThis line of thinking has also been elaborated and nuanced through the work of a \nrange of other writers in geography (Barnett 2005; Barnett and Land, 2007; Bosco, \n2007; Brock, 2005; Jazeel, 2007; Noxolo et al., 2008; Popke, 2003; 2007; Sparke, \n2007b). Some of these discussions of responsibility have centred around addressing \ninequality, in particularly the responsibilities of richer countries and people towards \nthose who are less wealthy or distanciated, often evoked through the figure of the \n\u2017distant stranger\u2018 (Patai, 1991; Corbridge, 1993, 1998; Smith, 2002). Other studies have  \nrevealed the distinctive temporal dimensions of these relationships, both the importance \nof the past in shaping the present (Andreasson, 2005; Biccum, 2005; Cupples et al, \n2007; Kapoor, 2004; Sharpe and Briggs, 2006) and also the need to think about \nresponsibility to those who will come in the future, especially in relation to the \nenvironment (Armstrong, 2006; Baldwin, 2004; Hillman, 2004; Hobson, 2006; \nRichardson, 2004)\n3\n. In this wide ranging literature on geographies of responsibility, \n 11 \nwe identify two key themes, which resonate with the care literature: responsibility as \nethical place-making; and relationships and (re)arrangements between places. Each is \nelaborated in turn below.  \n \nResponsibility as ethical place-making    \nGeographers have been at the forefront in recognising that relations are forged \nthrough, and implicated in, place-making practices because places are \u2017the moments \nthrough which the global is constituted, invented, coordinated, produced.  They are \nthe individual and collective \u2017agents\u2018 in globalisation\u2018 (Massey, 2004, p.11) who \nshape the nature and scope of global inequalities. Moreover, as Iris Young (2003, \np.41) suggests: \n\u2017Most of us contribute to a greater or lesser degree to the production and \nreproduction of structural injustice precisely because we follow the accepted \nand expected rules and conventions of the communities in which we live. \nUsually we enact standard practices in a habitual way, without explicit \nreflection on what we are doing, having in the foreground of our \nconsciousness and intention our immediate goals and the particular people we \nneed to interact with to achieve them\u2018.  \n \nThus, it is critical that we recognise the many and varied ways in which this \nindividual and collective agency often operates specifically through the making of \nplace. In the end, it is what people do in place, day-to-day, that makes places what \nthey are, and it is the interactions between people as agents in and across different \nplaces that constitutes those places. Any responsible agency needs therefore to be \n 12 \nunderstood as a place-making agency. This understanding is a vital and important \nintervention that geographers have made to the responsibility literature. \n \nAlthough geographers have theorised the importance of place in defining the contours \nof responsibility, this is less true of other disciplines.\n4\n Thus, for Escobar the \nmarginalisation of place is an important aspect of Eurocentrism, as place offers an \nimportant arena for shared identity: \n\u2017The marginalisation of place in European social theory of the nineteenth and \ntwentieth centuries has been particularly deleterious to those social \nformulations for which place-based modes of consciousness and practices \nhave continued to be important\u2026 The reassertion of place thus appears as an \nimportant arena for rethinking and reworking Eurocentric forms of analysis\u2018 \n(Escobar, cited in Escobar, 2001, p.141).  \n \nThis reassertion of place by geographers highlights the inherently relational nature of \nresponsibility and urges us \u2017to do something about it\u2018 (Massey, 2004, p.10). The \nspecificity of place in writing about responsibility is important because without finely \ntuned contextualisations, discussions of responsibility become generalised and fail to \nanchor in specific political projects. As a result, responsibility can be readily \nappropriated into an individualised, \u2017responsibilised\u2018 agenda, (including that \nsurrounding responsibilities and UK citizenship, Clark, 2005) rather than one based \non carefully tuned responsiveness and attentiveness. Responsibility as ethical place- \nmaking therefore really matters! \n \nRelations and (re)arrangements between places \n 13 \nA second body of work on geographies of responsibility focuses on relations and \n(re)arrangements between places and how a place not only produces responsibilities \nto that place but also responsibilities to other places. Viewing responsibility as \ninherently relational opens up a \u2017configurational politics of responsibility for the \nnature and effects of that wider geography of relations through which we are made\u2018 \n(Massey, 2006b, p.94).  \n \nThese responsibilities are not to a distinct or separate \u2017other\u2018 but rather, the \u2017other\u2018 \ninterpellates to produce us.  Arturo Escobar\u2018s (2001) review of anthropological \nstudies of identity and place precisely draws out the intersubjective elements of \nrelationships in, of and through place.  He points out that phenomenological \nanthropologists, for example, insist on the need for \u2017greater sensitivity in capturing \nintersubjective processes of shared experience\u2018 (Escobar, 2001, p.150).   Escobar is \nnot here talking about going back to an unquestioning bounded sense of place, but \nrather that place is constructed intersubjectively, not only between people who live in \na place, but also between people who live in different places. \n \nSimilarly, for Doreen Massey (2004) recognising that the local is not only constituted \nby the global but is also constitutive of it has significant implications for how we \nconceive the responsibilities of individuals in particular places.  One consequence of \nthis is that local political responsibility cannot be limited to simply acknowledging \nthat a locale like a global city (see Massey, 2007) is constituted through global \nrelations while still defending those places as local and as \u2017ours\u2018. It must also \nchallenge the local economic and political processes that enable and constitute those \nglobal relations.  Instead of the \u2017inwardlookingness\u2018 (Massey, 2006a, p.65) that tends \n 14 \nto come simply from the recognition that many places have contributed people to a \nplace like London, Massey advocates an \u2017outwardlookingness\u2018 (Massey, 2006b, p.92) \nthat comes from the recognition that London has huge effects on the lives of people in \na range of other places.  She argues that: \u2017We are responsible to areas beyond the \nbounds of place not because of what we have done, but because of what we are\u2018 \n(Massey, 2004, p.16). At a minimum, this gestures to a responsibility based not just \non historical exploitation, but also, crucially, on contemporary inequalities. \n \nThis focus on place as intersubjectively constructed highlights the multiplicity of \nlocations, as well as the variety of interactions between people who are located \ndifferently, that go into making places. This has enormous implications for any \nformulation of responsible agency based on relational geographies.  Escobar\u2018s (2001, \np.161) work takes as its example the place-making practices of activists in the \nrainforests of the Pacific region of Columbia, and insists that there be a parallel \ndefence of territorial particularity in order for people in some places to resist \nappropriation by powerful forces of global capital.  The difference between places is \nsummarised by the fact that there is ultimately, \u2017far more purchase in some places \nthan in others on the levers of globalisation\u2018 (Massey, 2004, p.12) and this has \nconsequences for responsibility.  This is not to see responsibility in a legal sense of \npayback or guilt but rather to emphasise its political sense so that its agency is shared. \nAs Young argues (2003, p.42): \n\u2017if the injustice is a result of structural processes involving many individuals \nand institutions engaging in normal and accepted activities, the necessary \nchange requires the cooperation of many of those individuals and \n 15 \ninstitutions\u2026 those who can properly be called victims of structural injustice \noften share the responsibility to try to change the structures.\u2018  \nIn other words, responsibility for change is not the preserve of the relatively powerful \nacting on behalf of the relatively powerless, but is a dialogic, intersubjective process. \n \nMoreover, an intersubjective reading also suggests that our responsibility to ourselves \nand that to others are not clearly demarcatable - the boundaries between outside and \ninside in relation to place and, by implication, the boundaries between self and other \n(see Noxolo et al., 2008, for a more detailed treatment of the postcolonial within) are \nalways blurred. \u2017Inwardlookingness\u2018 (Massey 2006a, p. 65) and \u2017outwardlookingness\u2018 \n(Massey, 2006b, p.92) are no longer clearly distinguishable, as Massey clarifies in \nrelation to London (2004, p.17). She suggests that the relationships between people\u2018s \nresponsible agency and the making of place are highly differentiated within the city \nitself: \n \u2017Londoners\u2018 are located in radically contrasting and unequal positions in \nrelation to today\u2018s globalisation\u2026  The political argument should be about \nhow those small and highly differentiated bits of all of us which position us as \n\u2017Londoners\u2018 give rise to responsibility towards the wider relations on which \nwe depend\u2018. (Massey, 2006b, p. 92) \n \nThe corollary of this is that the places that are constituted as outside London are \nthemselves often also profoundly internally differentiated in relation to London, with \na wide range of postcolonial intimacies and estrangements to and from the city and its \ninhabitants.  Place-making in terms of relational geographies can therefore be \nunderstood as a complex mixture between \u2017inwardlookingness\u2018 and \n 16 \n\u2017outwardlookingness\u2018, a simultaneous co-presence.  Henry et al.\u2018s (2002) analysis of \nglobalization in Birmingham, England, gives something of the Janus-like flavour of \nthis thoroughly networked sense of place, in which relationships between \nindividuals\/collectivities and place (and, by extension their place-based sense of \nresponsibility) is often orientated as much around relations with other places, as \naround relations with other people in Birmingham. Though this networked \ntransnationalism is most clearly understood in relation to (particularly the business \npractices of) relatively recently-migrated ethnic groups, Young\u2018s (2003) picture of the \nbanal localised agency of individuals in globalisation (as quoted above) is such that \nJanus-faced inward\/outwardlookingness is an increasingly important part of the lives \nof almost everyone in large conurbations, and increasingly in rural areas (Hickley \n2007), whether or not they are aware of it. It is such complex relations and \nrearrangements between places that form a second important strand of the \ngeographies of responsibilities literature.  \n \nIn reviewing the geographical literature on care and responsibility, we have identified \nsome overarching themes in the way that care and responsibility are currently \nimagined and talked about. In the next section we aim to explore how these concepts \nand their relationalities may be complicated, and sometimes extended, by adopting a \npostcolonial analysis. We suggest that their encounter with postcolonialism can \nperceptively shift the frame \u2013 to one in which care and responsibility are understood \nto be historicised, fractured and contested relations. In adopting such a \u2017non-\nnormative\u2018 approach to care and responsibility we hope to assist \u2017the frequently \nconflict-laden, intense, gritty, and fleshy character of relationships to surface \u2026 rather \nthan remaining submerged by a paradigm which sees them as messy exceptions or \n 17 \nflaws\u2018 (Cooper, 2007, p.257).  Below we explore three ways in which a postcolonial \nreading might open up responsibility and care: through challenging the idea of \nproximate and distant relations; by rethinking the frame of temporality; and in \nquestioning the centre from which care and responsibility can be talked about.\n5\n \n \n(Re)Thinking Postcolonial Responsibilities and Care  \nFirst, a key and underlying feature of postcolonial theory is that it interrogates the \nunderstandings of distance in socio-spatial relations, asking who is near and who is \nfar (Allen, 2003; 2006)? It questions, what is distance and asks where is the centre \nfrom which distance and proximity are measured? Postcolonial responsibility means \nthat we are not talking about \u2017distant others\u2018 but others whose lives and modes of \nliving are still proximate (and have been for some time) and influenced by \n(neo)colonialism in its variegated forms. This complex claim of belonging to, and \nproximity with, people and places that are often seen as separated through inexorable \ndifference is summarised by George Lamming\u2018s claim that: \u2017The pleasure and \nparadox of my own exile is that I belong wherever I am\u2018 (Lamming, 1960, p.50). This \ncomplex and painful interdependence, this mutuality, poses challenges for thinking \nabout both care and responsibility.  Through a postcolonial lens we would argue that \nthe notion of distance gets altered as all of us are already implicated in each other\u2018s \n\u2017presents\u2018 in complicated ways. Lines of caring and responsibility are therefore \nunclear and not wholly pre-decided but do have traces from the past and implications \nfor the future. In sum, postcolonial responsibility and care fold up, and reopen, space \nin complicated ways (Madge et al., this issue). \n \n 18 \nAt the same time, as postcolonial theorists have argued, there are still spaces in many \nparts of the world that are not entirely determined through their relations with each \nother (Mufti, 2005), so that while postcoloniality requires us to recognise the mutual \nconstitution of different geographical places and the importance of each for the \nother\u2018s formations, it also forces us to acknowledge that places are not always entirely \nconstituted through this relation. Postcolonial theory therefore forces us to \nacknowledge abruptness and separation as well as connections and flows. It suggests a \ncomplex spatial equation whereby places can be a part of, whilst still being apart \nfrom, other places. Being responsible then involves taking account of, but also being \naccountable to, both the connections and the disconnections, between these different \nspaces and places and their distinctive world picturing (cf Noxolo et al., 2008). This \nhas implications for thinking through care and responsibility. For example, lines of \nresponsibility are not always clear because we have to always ask ourselves, \nresponsibility in what spaces, places, times and for which people? What are the limits \nto responsibility and how are these worked through in different spatial arrangements? \nWhen does acting responsibly mean refusing to be responsible? It also suggests the \nlimits to care: who benefits from delivering care? Is care necessarily good for the \ncarer\/cared? When does caring actually become an irresponsible act? \n \nA second major challenge to thinking about responsibility and care through the \npostcolonial frame concerns temporality. Instead of seeing responsibility as coming \nout of relationality over spatial distance rather than temporal distance (see Massey, \n2004, p.10), or even attempting to see time and space as resolved in space-time, \npostcolonial literature engages time as a challenge to the notion of distance (and the \npervasive, but historically anomalous figure of the \u2017stranger\u2018 that it brings with it, see \n 19 \nMassey, 2004, p.10; and Corbridge, 1993).  As Bhabha (1995) has argued, the \nhistorical and contemporary mutuality of relationships between the formerly \ncolonised and the formerly colonising has often been denied.  Thus Western \ndiscourses around the global South, including development discourses, produce \nAfrica, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean in terms of absences, rather than \npresences, in terms of that which the North has that they do not. For Sousa (2003, \np.238-239) five \u2017monocultures\u2018 have helped produce these \u2017absences\u2018 within colonial \nand post-independence development discourses: monocultures of knowledge, linear \ntime, classification, the universal\/global, and the criteria of capitalist productivity and \nefficiency. These monocultures shape the imaginaries of both the global North and the \nSouth, so that some people and places are treated as temporal anachronisms (Hindess, \n2007). This denial of coevalness (related to the discourse of linear time) has meant \nthat the shared presence and shared relationship of the North with other places has not \nbeen acknowledged, and it is this temporality that postcolonial theory critiques most \nconsistently (see Slater, 2004). \n \nHowever, this insistence that places cannot be plotted at different points on a unilinear \nmap of historical progress does not necessarily mean that temporality should be seen \nas entirely shared. Homi Bhabha criticises Foucault\u2018s spatial imaginary of the West \n(Euro-America) alone as too restricted, necessitating \u2017homogenising spatial metaphors \nthat do not allow for the different disjunctive temporalities of other cultural \narticulations\u2018 (Bhabha, 1995,  p. 83, our emphasis).  As Wilson Harris has noted in \nrelation to Caribbean history, it is often impossible to see the history of places that \nhave been characterised by repeated invasions and brutal forced migrations in terms \nof having a linear history that can be placed alongside a Western linear history, even \n 20 \nin terms of coevalness: \u2017how can one begin to reconcile the broken parts of such an \nenormous heritage, especially when those broken parts appear very often like a \ngrotesque series of adventures\u2026\u2018 (Harris, 1967, p.31).  Temporality therefore \nbecomes in itself a source of difference.  \n \nThis understanding of temporality as neither continuous nor necessarily coeval but \nfractured and selectively incorporated means that calls to take account of historical \nrelations in order to shape the nature and direction of responsibility and care become \nfar from simple. Thus we would, for instance, agree with Tronto (2003) that narratives \nof speed and of contingency privilege future orientations and instantiations while \nthere is much less that forces us to take account of the past. She argues that while \nforgetting past injustices may be used as a way of invoking contemporary agency, the \nstructures and limitations of the past in shaping that agency may too easily be \nforgotten. It leaves no room for remedying past injustices or for moving towards a \nresponsible accountability. According to Tronto (2003, p.133) then:  \n\u2017The only solution to systematic ignorance is to try painstakingly to construct \nor reconstruct knowledge. The solution to these problems, then, is not to wish \nfor a brave new world, to recommend that we should consider only the future. \nInstead, we need to return to the painful, ugly and yet perhaps redeemable \nexcesses and injustices of the past, perpetrated by women and men, on men \nand women, throughout the world. Only if we are willing to give the past its \ndue will we have any firm ground to stand upon and pursue hope for the \nfuture.\u2018   \n \n 21 \nWe therefore concur that remembering the past is important, because forgetting or \n\u2017disremembering\u2018 the past may lead to forms of disintegration and denial that are \ndamaging to responsible and \u2017care-full\u2018 agency.  However, remembering the past, and \neven apologising for it (see Gatens and Lloyd, 1999), may be cleansing but is not in \nitself a simple remedy for past injustices. Spectral imaginings of the hauntedness of \nthe present in which place is constantly made and re-made show us that it is not \nalways possible to remedy the past.  Perhaps more generative is the imagination of \nother times that might (or might not) be \u2017emergent\u2018 (Sousa, 2003, p.242) from our \nimmanent global relationality. For example, Paul Gilroy (1993, p.68) talks of \nenslaved\/colonised people\u2018s repeated re-imagining of the \u2017jubilee\u2018 moment, a time \noutside of time, in which those who are disavowed and displaced will find a place.  \nThe effect of this spectral \u2017other time\u2018 is to constantly remind us that all existing \nsocial formations, including place, are fully contingent and uninevitable, which is the \nstarting condition for a \u2017politics of the possible\u2018 (Sangari, 1990). \n \nFinally, postcolonial thinking also challenges the centre from which care and \nresponsibility can be talked about. Postcolonial theory is crucially concerned with the \nability to write\/speak back (Ashcroft et al., 1989), because its object is not only the \ndecentring of the West but crucially a re-balancing of the West with the rest of the \nworld (Hall, 1992). It deconstructs the enlightenment subjectivities that defined the \ncolonial and \u2017othered\u2018 rest of the world in relation to it, but crucially it also seeks to \nre-constitute subject positions from which people around the world can find voice to \nspeak about themselves. This decentering can also be usefully extended to care and \nresponsibility: What does care look like for different people from different centers? \nDrawing on humanism, the contours of care are often presumed and defined by ethical \n 22 \nvalues which masquerade as universal, a universality that is deeply challenged by \npostcolonial contributions. Similarly, we may well ask how responsibilities might \nchange with insistence of \u2017voicing\u2018 those who have been left out of the script for far \ntoo long? In a telling example, Koschade  and  Peters (2006) discuss how Algonquin \ncommunities in Canada conceive of space and responsibility in deeply ecological, \nrather than narrowly juridical, terms. They argue that Algonquin concepts of \nknowledge, land and jurisdiction are incompatible with existing Euro-Canadian \ndivisions of legal responsibility and ecological knowledge, but at the same time such \nincompatibilities can offer the means to challenge the current structure of Aboriginal \nand Canadian relations and can seek to forge dialogue that inserts a multiplicity of \nconcepts and ways of understanding onto the institutional agenda. This example \nsuggests that postcolonial responsibility must involve willingness and ability to \nrespond to what the postcolonial public might have to say about how different \npresents are co-produced. Here we are not arguing for some \u2017authentic Southern \nvoice\u2018 but rather that there is a shared immanent relationship that can form the basis \nfor decentring the nature and direction of responsibility. This may involve a \n\u2017splintering\u2018 of familiar ways of understanding self and other relationships, by \nunsettling the coherence and integrity ascribed to both centre and periphery. \n \nThus shifting the centre can challenge conceptualisations of what responsibility might \nactually mean and alert us to the range of responses that could be evoked in the \n\u2017reaching out\u2018 that marks responsibility. For one, the ability to speak and to hear may \nboth be muted for complex reasons. For instance, pernicious bio politics removes \nsome global citizens from beyond the care of the state (Sylvester, 2006), putting these \ncitizens' voices out of circulation, enclosing their bodies, and foreclosing the forms of \n 23 \ninterconnectedness in which they are embedded (Vasudevan et al. forthcoming). On \nthe other hand, responsibilities that are enacted may well be refuted by the \u2017other\u2018.  \nTaking responsibility may be seen as an act of complicity with colonialism - after all, \ncolonialism was itself justified through tales of universalism and in defence of \nhumanism (Lester, 2002). To posit responsibility in a finite future is to (re)colonise \nresponsibility. For instance, as Mezzadra and Rahola (2006, p.5) argue, this form of \nresponsibility may simply deprive: \n\u2017the insurgent colonised subject, the rebellious subaltern, of all possible forms \nof agency or of any possibility of directly intervening in history; self-\nabsolution, to the extent that it eliminates from history all direct responsibility \nthat is not identified with the colonial West and, so too, any revolutionary act \nthat does not belong to the West, not only hands over all responsibility from \nbut also \u2013 and above all \u2013 shifts action from the colonised subject to the \neternal (neo-)colonial Subject.\u2018  \n \nWe therefore suggest that responsibility and care are always left open to the multiple \nmeanings that they may take in various places. To do so refutes an approach to \nresponsibility and care that assumes an asymmetry in focusing on \u2017the fragility of the \nother\u2018 and the \u2017radical generosity of altruistic existence\u2018 (Beasley and Bacchi, 2007, \np. 285). Instead it urges an approach to responsibility and care which focuses on \ninterdependence and coexistence and makes apparent the potential connections \nbetween responsibility, care and power, at a variety of scales (Beasley and Bacchi, \n2007, p. 286). \n \nConclusions and introductions  \n 24 \nIn this article we have argued that both responsibility and care have much to offer in \nthinking about relationalities in a postcolonial world. Geographers\u2018 efforts to locate \nthese terms within narratives of interdependency \u2013 spatially and temporally - has done \nmuch to challenge dominant tendencies within contemporary political systems to posit \nthese inherently relational words within the context of individuation and autonomy. \nThe papers in this special issue take this project further by routing these terms through \nthe critical terrain of postcolonialism where interdependency is not cosy but is seen as \ncontested, complicated and productively unsettling. They show that routing care and \nresponsibility through postcolonial geographies incites us towards a more embodied \npragmatic responsiveness, one that makes a \u2017care-full\u2018 recognition of postcolonial \ninteraction. \n \nThese papers explore this postcolonial interaction in all its complexity. Marcus \nPower\u2018s paper \u2017The Commonwealth, \u2017development\u2018 and post-colonial responsibility\u2018 \nfocuses on the Commonwealth\u2018s contemporary sense of \u2017responsibility\u2018 for shaping \nAfrican \u2017development\u2018 through \u2017partnerships\u2018 and by promoting \u2017good governance\u2018. \nPower usefully examines the continuing post-colonial interaction between Britain and \nits Commonwealth, specifically using the case of Mozambique, to highlight \ncontinuing British neo-colonial paternalism based on a sense of trusteeship and an \nunproblematised vision of African development. Parvati Raghuram also explores this \npostcolonial interaction in her paper \u2017Caring about \u2017brain drain\u2018 migration in a \npostcolonial world\u2018. Here Raghuram argues that current discussions of health worker \nmobility from the South to the North, which centre around brain drain, are somewhat \nlimited because they fail to see the layers of interaction that have shaped what we see \nas health or what becomes constituted as health work. She argues for the need to \n 25 \nadopt a spatial lens that recognises the histories of mobility that shaped health work \nglobally but also the health care sector in the UK specifically. Clare Madge et als\u2019 \npaper \u2017Engaged pedagogy and responsibility: a postcolonial analysis of international \nstudents\u2018 concentrates on the increasing internationalisation of the UK higher \neducation system, illustrating how such contemporary global connections are also a \nreflection of historical, postcolonial interaction. They scrutinize the implications of \nthese interactions for academic responsibilities in relation to international students \nwithin everyday academic practices. \n \nIn addition to exploring postcolonial interaction, in this introductory paper we have \nalso argued that postcolonial perspectives on responsibility urge us to become attuned \nto both  the ways in which temporalities of the past seep through to form the present \nand also to remain vigilant to those historical relations which remain hidden, \nunrecognisable or have mutated. This means that the directions and shape of \nresponsibility and care are not wholly traceable, leaving room for the surprising, the \nunanticipated and therefore for a responsibility where who is being responsible to \nwhom becomes less clear-cut, more labile. At its heart, postcolonial analysis therefore \nraises questions surrounding the responsibilities that people in different parts of the \nworld bear to each other and their ability and desire to care for each other. It suggests \nthat these issues have to be worked out in each instance but in working it out this \ninherent ambivalence and ambiguity of space and place can unsettle responsibility and \ncare. It is this unsettling that we have explored in our article. As such, our paper \ncontributes towards moves being made elsewhere (see, for example, Cupples et al., \n2007) to destabilize and disrupt the linear temporalities and spatial fixities of much \ndevelopment\/geographical thought and practice.  \n 26 \n \nThis unsettling is also followed through in several papers in the special issue. Gillian \nRose\u2018s paper \u2017Who cares for which dead and how?\u2018 draws on Mbembe\u2018s formulation \nof \u2017necropolitics\u2018 to interrogate media coverage of the London bombings in July \n2005.  She focuses, in particular, on the gendering and racialisation of bodies in \nphotographs, arguing that this complex visual economy worked to place the reader \ninto particular relationships of caring (or otherwise) in relation to the dead. Patricia \nNoxolo turns her attention to academic writing in her paper \u2017\u2015My paper, my paper\u2016: \nreflections on the embodied production of postcolonial geographical responsibility in \nacademic writing\u2018. Noxolo uncovers the way in which the body \u2017speaks\u2018 in academic \nwriting, arguing that it is within the multiple materialities of the body that a \nresponsible politics of postcolonial writing can most fruitfully be located.  \n \nFinally, several papers in this special issue also show how responsibility and care \nmight appear, not from an imagined centre, but from other different positions, \nincluding those who are distant and those who help to constitute the centre through \ntheir presence. Jenny Pickerill\u2018s paper \u2017Finding Common Ground\u2018 explores the ways \nin which responsibilities towards the environment are negotiated through interactions \nbetween Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists in environmental campaigns in \nAustralia, recognising the need for dialogue across different views of scale, as well as \nbetween different claims and concepts of ownership and control. Claire Newstead\u2018s \npaper \u2017Pedagogy, post-coloniality and care-full encounters in the classroom\u2018 considers \nwhat it means to take up the political post-colonial commitment to simultaneously \ncritique and destabilise pedagogic practice. Through the use of fiction in an \nundergraduate course on the post-colonial Caribbean, Newstead attempts to encourage \n 27 \nmore open-ended and responsive encounters to Caribbean people and places, to \nencourage students to develop fresh ways of working with inequality and difference. \nThese papers thus call for contingent negotiated readings of responsibility and care \nthat take on board the complexities of local configurations of power and the \nspecificities of geographical and historical context. \n \nWhat all the papers in this special issue suggest is that by reading postcolonialism not \nas the sanitised \u2017after-colonialism\u2018 but as anti-colonialism, an unanticipated set of \nemotions and painful imperatives flow through into both responsibility and care. Anti-\ncolonialism charges responsibility and care with emotions such as anger, anticipation \nand hope that make responsibility not a burden but forward-looking: it contains \n\u2017alternative visions, alternative understandings of how the world could be better\u2018 \n(Gilmartin and Berg, 2007, p.120). In recognising the power of enlivening pain it \nsuggests vivaciousness and energy for change which occurs both through, and despite \nof, hardship, sacrifice and loss that other forms of responsibility do not quite muster. \nAnd these productive emotions can form the basis for generating long-term embodied \nand pragmatic responsiveness. \n \nIn this special issue we are also moved towards thinking about postcoloniality with \nresponsibility and care. This is important because postcolonial theory enters the \nwestern academy as a demand for inclusion of those who have been marginalised and \ndispossessed, but crucially it is a demand for inclusion, not by becoming the same, but \nfor inclusion of that difference.  Postcolonial theory is therefore not just \u2017the next big \nthing\u2018 \u2013 it makes a demand for change. Ultimately, for geography as a discipline, \nperhaps the most important and timely contribution we would like to make is to \n 28 \nencourage that postcolonial theory itself be treated responsibly and with care so that \nits promise of radical change is carried through. \n \nReferences \nAllen, J., 2003.

But we see place-\nmaking as an intersubjective process (cf Escobar, 2001). Moreover, although the \nliterature privileges urban places, our argument extends to all places- urban, suburban, \nmarket towns, rural areas- all of which are co-produced through a \u2017distant localness\u2018. \n \n2\n While all of the above literature locates care as a relationship between individuals, \nSusan Smith (2005) significantly extends this argument by showing that affect and \nresponsibility can be applied to markets as much as to individuals. Through an \nexample of how people care about housing, she lays out some ways in which people \ninvest emotionally in markets. Caring about institutional practices, she suggests, can \ncontribute much to understandings of participation in voluntary organisations and \ntrade unions. \n \n3\n Other discussions of responsibility in geography have revolved around responsible \nresearch praxis, political commitment and social justice, often articulated through the \nlens of responsible citizenship (Beaumont et al., 2005; Cloke, 2002; Davies, 2006; \nGibson, 2006; Hay and Foley, 1998) but we do not focus on these here. \n \n4\n But in literature see Spivak (2007). And for our more serious engagement with \nSpivak\u2018s writing on the subject see Raghuram et al. (forthcoming). \n 38 \n                                                                                                                                            \n5\n Delinking time from space is itself an artificial process that occludes questions such \nas what kinds of spatial arrangements led to certain pasts? And how were time and \nspace co-produced in these moments? What lines from the past came forward to shape \npresent temporalities and spatialities? \n"}
