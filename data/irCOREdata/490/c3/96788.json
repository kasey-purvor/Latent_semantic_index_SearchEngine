All rights\nreserved.\nHISTORY OF THE BULLETIN\nThe BMB was first published in March 1939 with the title Bulletin of Mathe-\nmatical Biophysics as a supplement to the journal Psychometrika. The Bulletin\nwas published in March, June, September and December and was devoted to pub-\nlications of research in mathematical biophysics, as contributing to the physico-\nmathematical foundations of biology. The papers covered physico-mathematical\ntheories as well as any other mathematical treatments of biological phenomena,\nwith the exception of purely statistical studies or papers dealing with empirical\n\u0001This is an expanded version of a report published in the Society for Mathematical Biology\nNewsletter, Volume 16, Number 3, pp. 9\u201312, 2003.\n\u2020These authors contributed equally.\n\u2021Also at: Christ Church, Oxford OXI 1DP, UK.\n\u2217Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Maini et al.\nequations. Description of experimental work also fell within the scope of the Bul-\nletin provided that it made close comparison with the mathematical formulations\ndeveloped in the same paper (Rashevsky, 1939). The Bulletin was sent free to all\nmembers of the Psychometric Society.\nThe Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics was founded by Dr Nicolas Rashevsky,\nwho is generally recognised as the founder of the first organised group in Math-\nematical Biology in the world. This group had been formed at the University of\nChicago in 1947 as the interdisciplinary Committee on Mathematical Biology from\nthe previous one on Mathematical Biophysics. The latter had been founded by\nRashevsky in 1934 after obtaining a Rockefeller Fellowship on the basis of his\nmany investigations of the mathematics of biological phenomena, in particular the\neffects of surface tension and diffusion drag forces during cell division, and nerve\nexcitation (Bartholomay et al., 1972; Rosen, 1972).\nThe Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics quickly became the classical journal in\ngeneral mathematical biology and served as the principal natural publication outlet\nfor the majority of mathematical biologists. Many classical papers have appeared\nin the Bulletin and several of these are familiar to biologists. It has become an\nimportant avenue for the exchange and transmission of new ideas and approaches to\nbiological problems and incorporates both the quantitative and qualitative aspects\nof mathematical models and characterisations of biological processes and systems.\nDr Rashevsky remained the editor of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics\nuntil his death on January 16th, 1972. During the last year of his life he founded\nMathematical Biology, Inc. which became the publisher of the Bulletin. Dr Rashev-\nsky owned Mathematical Biology, Inc. and acquired the ownership of the Bulletin\nas well. In June 1972, Volume 34, Number 2, he was succeeded by Herbert D.\nLandahl from University of California at San Francisco (Chief Editor), and George\nKarreman from University of Pennsylvania and Anthony F. Bartholomay from the\nMedical College of Ohio at Toledo working as co-editors.\nIn February\u2013April 1973, Volume 35, Numbers 1\u20132, the Bulletin of Mathematical\nBiophysics was re-titled the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology and became the offi-\ncial journal of the recently incorporated Society for Mathematical Biology of which\nDr Landahl was a co-founder [see, Conrad (1996), for a History of the Society].\nThe BMB continued to be published bi-monthly and the editorial policy remained\nthe same as that of its predecessor, the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics. The\nannual dues for membership of the Society for Mathematical Biology were $25\nwhich included a subscription to the Bulletin. Herbert D. Landahl continued as\nChief Editor with Hugo M. Martinez as Assistant Editor until Volume 43, Num-\nber 6, 1981. Hugo Martinez took over as Chief Editor in Volume 44, Number 1,\n1982 with Julie S. Ransom (The University of California, San Francisco) as Edi-\ntorial Assistant. They retired in 1986, Volume 48, No. 3\/4. Lee A. Segel from\nthe Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, became the first non-American editor of\nthe Bulletin in Volume 48, No. 5\/6, 1986. Lee Segel in his Editorial Announce-\nment of Volume 49, No. 1, pp. i\u2013iv, 1987 changed the scope of the journal to offer\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology 597\nthe publication of research at or near the interface of theoretical and experimen-\ntal biology. An ideal article for the Bulletin would be a symbiotic combination of\ntheory and experiment. Lee Segel also welcomed papers providing documentation\nof a purely theoretical advance together with a clear exposition of how this advance\nfurthers biological understanding. Philip K. Maini became the present editor in\n2002, Volume 64, Number 1. As he mentioned in his Editorial (Volume 64, No. 1,\np. 1), he took over as editor of the Bulletin at a very exciting time for mathemati-\ncal biology. The advances made in molecular biology over the past three decades\nhave resulted in the generation of a vast amount of experimental data. The need\nto understand this data requires the development and analysis of mathematical and\ncomputational models; this is increasingly recognised as a number of interdisci-\nplinary centres have recently been set up for modelling in life sciences and more\nfaculty positions are being advertised. This also confirms the great insight shown\nby those who set up and worked as editors for this particular journal, and it is\nreflected in the present position of the BMB in the Journal Citation Reports.\nJOURNAL CITATION REPORTS\nThe Journal Citation Reports (JCR) is a comprehensive resource for journal eval-\nuation from the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI)\u2217. It is used by scientists,\nuniversities, research institutes, publishers and government to evaluate the impact\nof journals in the scientific community, and also to select preferred journals in\nwhich to publish. The JCR lists the highest impact journals, most frequently used\njournals, \u2018hottest\u2019 journals and largest journals. It uses citation data drawn from\nover 8400 scholarly and technical journals worldwide and the citations are col-\nlected from 1981. Coverage is both multidisciplinary and international, and incor-\nporates journals from over 3000 publishers in 60 countries.\nThe most widely used index from JCR is the journal impact factor, which is a\nmeasure of the frequency with which the \u2018average article\u2019 in a journal has been\ncited in a particular year. The impact factor is calculated by dividing the number of\ncurrent citations to articles published in the two previous years by the total number\nof articles published in the two previous years. This index helps to evaluate a\njournal\u2019s relative importance, especially when compared to others in the same field.\nIn this report we show the JCR results for the BMB in the year 2002.\nThe trends in the impact factor show that the BMB has increased its impact from\n0.980 in the year 1997 to 1.408 in 2002. In fact, the impact has been increasing\nfrom 2000 when it was 1.002 and 1.316 in 2001. The JCR gathers journals into\nsubject categories for comparison with journals in the same field.

The immediacy index indicates how often articles published in\na journal are cited within the same year. It is calculated by dividing the number of\ncitations to articles published in a given year by the number of articles published in\nthat year. The immediacy index is useful for comparing how quickly journals are\ncited. This index tends to discount the advantage of large journals over small ones,\nbecause it uses a per-article average. However, frequently issued journals have an\nadvantage, because an article published early in the year has a better chance of\nbeing cited than one published later in the year. For comparing journals specialis-\ning in cutting-edge research, the Immediacy Index can provide a useful perspective.\nThe cited half-life is the number of publication years from the current year which\naccounts for 50% of current citations received. This index evaluates the age of the\nmajority of cited articles published in a journal. Only those journals cited 100 or\nmore times have a cited half-life in the database. A higher or lower cited half-\nlife does not imply any particular value for a journal. For instance, a primary\nresearch journal might have a longer cited half-life than a journal that provides\nrapid communication of current information.\nJOURNALS CITING ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN BMB\nThe JCR also identifies those publications that most frequently cited a particular\njournal.

The BMB has received 974 citations between 1981 and 2002. The jour-\nnal citing most articles in the BMB is the Journal of Theoretical Biology with 41\nreferences to the Bulletin. It is followed by Physical Review E citing articles 32\ntimes in the BMB. These two journals are followed by Bulletin of Mathematical\nBiology and Mathematical and Computer Models (24 citations each), Journal of\nMathematical Biology (22 citations), Biosystems (18 citations) and Proceedings of\nthe Natural Academy of Sciences of USA (16 citations).

Cumulative percentage of submitted papers versus weeks taken to made the first\neditorial decision.\n2002\u20132003 STATISTICS FOR THE BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL\nBIOLOGY\nWe have carried out an analysis for the data available in the editorial office up to\nJanuary 31st, 2004. For the year 2002, the total number of papers submitted was\n114. From those, 66 were accepted, 45 rejected and 3 are outstanding. The median\ntime in weeks for the first decision from the editorial office is 14 weeks (mean time\nis 14.8 weeks) for the papers submitted in 2002.\nFor the year 2003, the total papers submitted were 143. The Bulletin accepted\n47 papers, rejected 46 and 50 are outstanding. We analyse the time in weeks for\nthe first decision from the editorial office for 118 papers. The median is 11 weeks\n(mean time is 12.4 weeks). In 2003 there was an improvement in the median\nresponse time which is due to new measures taken by the editorial office to improve\nthe processing of the papers. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe subject of published papers in 2002 and 2003 remained almost homogeneous\nwith the exception of the \u2018Physiology\u2019 and \u2018Computational Biology and Bioinfor-\nmatics\u2019 categories. The number of \u2018Physiology\u2019 papers decreased in 2003 and\nthe number of \u2018Computational Biology and Bioinformatics\u2019 papers increased (see\nFig. 2).\n2003 PUBLICATION BACKLOG OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY JOURNALS\nWe have estimated the publication backlog in a number of journals of choice for\nmathematical biologists, focusing on: Journal of theoretical Biology, Bulletin of\nMathematical Biology, Mathematical Biosciences, Journal of Mathematical Biol-\nogy and Mathematical Medicine and Biology\u2014A Journal of the IMA, formerly\nknown as IMA Journal of Mathematics Applied in Medicine and Biology.\n602 P.

Percentage published articles for the years 2002 and 2003 in subject categories.\nThe source of our data is the relevant journal Website with the exception of Jour-\nnal of Mathematical Biology. We have calculated for papers published in 2003 the\nnumber of days between received and acceptance dates, acceptance to print and\nacceptance to online publication, based on a 360-day year (twelve 30-day months).\nThe data for the Journal of Mathematical Biology were obtained from \u2018Backlog of\nMathematics Research Journals\u2019 published in the Notices of the AMS, Volume 50,\nNumber 8\u2014September 2003, pp. 961\u2013964.\nFrom Table 4, we observe that the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology is the peri-\nodical which was quickest to publish a paper. The median time from received to\nprint is 11.2 months (336.5 days). The Bulletin is followed very closely by the\nJournal of Theoretical Biology with a median time from received to print of 12.2\nmonths (366 days). They are followed by Mathematical Biosciences, which has a\nmedian (printed) publication time of 13.7 months (411 days). We calculated the\nreceived to print times for Medicine and Biology\u2014A Journal of the IMA from the\n2003 printed version of the journal. We obtained a median time of 11.3 months\n(340 days), which is very similar to that for the Bulletin.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is important to view the above data in context. For example, there has been a\n25% increase in the number of papers submitted to the Bulletin from 2002 to 2003.\nIt remains to be seen whether this is a statistical blip, or whether it reflects the\nincrease in research in the field. The most striking feature of Fig. 2 is the increase in\nthe number of papers in computational biology and bioinformatics, as a percentage\nof the total accepted papers.\nBulletin of Mathematical Biology 603\nTable 4.

Math. Appl. Med. and Biol.\nThe data on processing times presented in Table 4 must also be taken in context.\nFor example, many biological journals have substantially quicker turn-round times,\nmainly because reviewers are not expected to redo the experiments presented in the\npaper. One would expect that the more mathematical a journal is, the longer it will\ntake to review because the reviewer is expected to work through at least some of\nthe mathematics (see \u2018Backlog of Mathematics Research Journals\u2019 published in\nthe Notices of the AMS, Vol. 50, Number 8\u2014September 2003, pp. 961\u2013964, which\nshows that some mathematics journals can take up to 28.2 months from received to\nprint). The \u2018Received to accepted\u2019 data only partly reflect the journal\u2019s efficiency,\nas they depend also on the time taken for the authors to revise their manuscript.\nOne thing that is clear is the steady increase in impact factor of the journal. This\nis very exciting and bodes well for the future of the journal.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Edmund Crampin, Lov Gross and Ramit Mehr for helpful\ncomments.\nREFERENCES\nBartholomay, A.
