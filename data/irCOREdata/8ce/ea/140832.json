Introduction  \nThe competitive landscape for international trade in food is continuously evolving. Most  \ndeveloped and developing countries are removing tariffs and quotas as trade barriers, and  \nimplementing more stringent measures to ensure the safety of food. Food safety is the  \nconcept that food will not be injurious to the consumer at the point of consumption, when it  \nis prepared and\/or eaten according to its intended use (BS EN ISO 22000, 2005). Regulators  \nof the food sector have justifiable reasons for these changes in competitive landscape. Some  \nhave attributed it to the increased awareness of consumers about food safety, which is  \ncausing them to put pressure on regulators. Others have attributed it to the outbreak of  \nSalmonella and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the UK (Loader and Hobbs,  \n1999) and E. Coli 0157:H7 in some developed countries in Europe and America. Developing  \ncountries have also had their fair share of food contamination issues, even though the scale  \nof impact is difficult to estimate, due to inadequate surveillance systems and reporting \nstructures (WHO\/FAO, 2005). These occurrences in the past awakened concerns of major  \nstakeholders; they believed that prevailing mechanisms of controls and management of \nfood safety were inefficient and ineffective (Henson and Jaffee, 2006). The economically  \nmore advanced nations have been the driving force for most of these changes (Hanak et al.,  \n2000), with their governments striving consistently to increase traceability and transparency  \nthrough integrated approaches to food safety management. As a result of these  \ndevelopments, there has been a general reform of existing frameworks for the governance  \nof food safety globally. These forms of control executed at the global level, however, have  \nimplications at the domestic level, in terms of what practices can be undertaken at the  \ndifferent functional nodes of the global food value chain. Governments have incorporated \nthe reforms at the global level into their national reforms, through various forms of  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n2 \n \nincentives which put additional responsibility on enterprises, and in the case of small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs), more pressure on their already scarce resources, making \nsurvival uncertain. Mandating the implementation of integrated food safety management \nsystems has been seen by many as one of the most certain ways of assuring food safety,  \ngiven the nature of food, the difficulty associated with determining its safety before \nconsumption and the potentially devastating effects of food safety failure on human life. \nHowever, for some of the stakeholders who bear direct responsibility for operationalising  \nthe requirements of integrated food safety regulation, the process requirements are  \nonerous, and yet the expected benefits that drive compliance are not actually realised upon \nimplementation. Further, the process is fraught with a lot of both internal and external \nchallenges. A number of literature exist on the impact of food safety regulation on \nenterprises, the drivers for, benefits of, and challenges to an integrated approach to \noperationalising the requirements of food safety regulation in a variety of countries and  \nsectors; these studies have provided guidance on how to effectively implement regulatory  \nrequirements on the shop floor, particularly in Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point  \n(HACCP) regulation, and the compliance process model. Even though SMEs are said to  \ncontribute significantly to the economies of most countries, they are the least likely to  \ncomply with regulatory requirements because of resource constraints. Most studies have  \nfocused on large enterprise, independent of SMEs, arguing that it is difficult to get  \nresponses from smaller enterprise, and hence there is a paucity of work in this area. \nFurther, the authors are not as yet aware of any study that has particularly studied the \ndrivers, benefits, challenges and success factors in the context of the UK food manufacturing \nsector. Exceptions occur in Fairman and Yapp, (2004) and Yapp and Fairman, (2006), who \nstudied some of the variables in the context of SMEs in the catering sector and Taylor, \n(2001) who did not make explicit the sector of focus.  The uniqueness of this paper lies in \nthe use of an empirical approach to study food manufacturing enterprises in the UK, a \nstatistical examination of the significance of the difference between both SMEs and large \nenterprises in relation to an integrated approach to food safety management, and a  \ncontribution to the insights relevant to challenges enterprises face, to inform future policy \nrevisions and decisions. Section 2 looks at the developments in food safety regulations and  \nsection 3 discuses public and private regulation of food safety in the UK. Section 4 outlines \nthe methodology, and results are presented in section 5. A discussion of results is done in \nsection 6 and conclusion made in section 7. \n2. Developments in food safety regulation \nThe governance of food safety has evolved significantly in the past two decades. The \nevolution has affected the way in which food safety is assured globally. Notable trends \ninclude: \nA move towards more stringent approaches to food safety \nFood safety control presently combines both performance-based approaches (e.g end- \nproduct testing, inspection and sample testing) and integrated process-based approaches \n(e.g. regular audits, assessment by third party auditors, accreditation) to food safety \nmanagement. Voluntary inspections have almost given way to mandatory legal frameworks  \nin the form of Acts and Directives. Retailers are now using recognised certification \nframeworks (hands-off), which set out the basic minimum requirements of food safety  \nacceptable in the global food industry, and require supplying enterprises to be certified by  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n3 \n \nthird party auditors, before qualifying to supply food. Such certifications may be voluntarily \nor mandatorily sought by suppliers.  \nA requirement to justify food safety regulations  \nThrough the World Trade Organisation (WTO), trade barriers related to tariffs and quotas  \nhave been lowered considerably. This has fostered growing interdependencies through the \nexchange of food products, across national borders. However, emphasis is being placed on  \nnon-tariff barriers, and the wider recognition of their impact on trade (Henson and Caswell, \n1999).The established view among some researchers is that, standards in developed \ncountries present trade barriers to less developed countries (Henson and Jaffee,  \n2006).Therefore, the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS) was formulated by the \nWTO, to ensure that no country is unduly restricted from participating in global value \nchains. The SPS agreement endorses the use of international standards, based on CAC\u2019s \nrecommendations as a control measure for food safety, and requests that importing  \ncountries with regulatory standards more stringent than international standards, justify \nboth scientifically, through risk-based assessments (SPS Agreement, Article 5, paragraph 1), \nand\/or economically (SPS Agreement, Article 5, paragraph 6), through systematic quantified \nassessment of the costs and benefits of proposed food safety regulations(Henson, and \nCaswell, 1999).  \nA proliferation of standards \n There has also been an increase in the number of standards that seek to promote food \nsafety. These include the British Retail Consortium\u2019s global food safety standard (BRC), the \nInternational Food Standard (IFS), the Dutch Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point \n(HACCP), the Safe Quality Food (SQF) 2000 Level 2, and the ISO 22000:2005 .  \n\u2022  The BRC standard was developed in 1998, to respond to the needs of UK retailers  \nand brand manufacturers, however, the standard has gained popularity globally (e.g. \nin Europe and North America).   \n\u2022  The IFS on the other hand was drawn up by the German and French retailer and  \nwholesaler associations, and their Italian counterparts. IFS aims to create a \nconsistent evaluation system for all enterprises supplying retailer branded food \nproducts.  \n\u2022  The SQF Program is owned by the Food Marketing Institute (FMI). The standard \ncombines both food safety and quality management certification for all chain \nparticipants involved in the production and processing of food.   \n\u2022  The Dutch HACCP was designed by the Dutch National Board of Experts, to specify  \nthe requirements for HACCP-based food safety systems. The standard specifies the \ncodes of practice within a management system framework, and is particularly  \nsuitable for suppliers to the Dutch market. \nISO 22000 is a global standard developed to harmonise on a global level, the requirements \nfor food safety management, for businesses in food businesses (BS EN ISO 22000 2005), \napart from food manufacturers. ). The standard combines interactive communication, \nsystem requirements, prerequisite programmes, and HACCP principles to assure food \nsafety. The ISO 22000:2005 is complemented with the PAS 220 Prerequisite Programmes \n(PRPs) on food safety for food manufacturing to form the new Food Safety System \nCertification (FSSC) 22000 for food manufacturers.  \nSimilarities and differences amongst standards  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n4 \n \nMost of the standards discussed above are similar in the sense that they all have one main \nobjective: to protect consumer health through an integrated process-based food safety \nmanagement, achieved through specifying the basic minimum  requirements acceptable for \nfood safety, and third party audits. They provide a framework for uniformity in \nrequirements, audit procedures and mutual acceptance of audits, and reassure retailers and \nbranded manufacturers of the capability and competence of suppliers,  \n[Take in Table 1] \nAll the standards have the Codex Alimentarius Commission\u2019s (CAC) HACCP principles as their \nfoundation and some integrate quality management system requirements (table 1) into the \nfood safety standards (e.g. BRC, IFS, SQF). The major difference amongst the standards is  \nthat they are owned by different stakeholders in different geographical regions, and while  \nsome seek to specify generic requirements that could be adapted to chain participants at  \ndifferent functional nodes in value chains, some are specific to either primary food  \nproducers or food processors.  \nAttempts at harmonising food safety regulations  \nThere are significant variations in food safety regulations across countries and among value \nchains. These variations increase the burden of auditing costs and certifications on food  \nmanufacturers, as retailers require different certification frameworks to qualify suppliers. \nThe impacts of these variations on relevant actors present practical reasons for the need for  \nharmonising food safety regulations (Motarjemi et al., 2001). There are, however, justifiable  \nreasons to explain these variations (Henson and Jaffee, 2006). Some are attributed to the  \ndistinct tastes, diets, income levels and perceptions that influence the tolerance of \npopulations, towards the risk associated with food. The different private standards \nintroduced by brand manufacturers and retailers further introduce more variations into \nfood safety regulations and the modes of conformity assessments (Henson and Mitullah, \n2004). A common reference point was therefore required, from where the process of \nharmonisation of standards could be started, to reduce multiple certifications on food \nenterprises. The SPS Agreement, introduced by the WTO, facilitates a move towards this \nmuch needed common reference point, by providing a basis to establish equivalence and \nharmony in food safety regulations. According to Article 4, paragraph 1 of the SPS \nAgreement, Member States are to accept the measures of control employed by others as  \nequivalent if the exporting country demonstrates to the importing country that its\u2019 measure \nmeets the importing country\u2019s appropriate level of health protection. As mentioned in  \nearlier sections, harmony is further encouraged by the WTO, through the endorsement of  \ninternational standards as a measure of control for food safety. The WTO Agreement on \nTechnical Barriers to Trade (TBT) which is binding on Member States, also includes as \nprinciples to foster harmonisation, the \u2018one-one-one\u2019 principle, which implies, one standard, \none test accepted everywhere, one conformity assessment mark where relevant (IEC,  \n2008).  \nIn light of discussions above, international standards clearly form a fundamental part of \nfood safety harmonisation. The proliferation of global food safety standards necessitated a  \nsystem to ensure that a global standard developed for one region and retailer was valid for \nother regions and retailers. It is as a result of these issues that the Global Food Safety  \nInitiative (GFSI) was introduced in 2000, to benchmark existing certification frameworks for  \nfood safety, to ensure convergence amongst food safety standards, and to maintain a  \nbenchmarking process for food safety management schemes. So far, thirteen  GFSI  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n5 \n \nbenchmarked international standards  for manufacturing, primary production and one for \nboth primary and manufacturing have been accepted by  major retailers (e.g.Carrefour, \nTesco, Metro, Migros, Ahold, Wal-Mart and Delhaize) (CIES, 2007), . The international \nstandards recognised by the GFSI have successfully been aligned with the common criteria \ndefined by food safety experts from the Food Business. This implies those retailers will \naccept any of the recognised GFSI certification schemes as proof of \u2018due diligence\u2019 in food \nsafety procedures (CIES, 2007).  \nTougher requirements for laboratory analysis and third party auditing bodies  \nThe changing landscape of food safety has put increased pressure on laboratories used for  \nanalysing products for food safety and third party auditing bodies. There has been a trend  \ntoward \u2018accreditation\u2019 of laboratories and third party auditing bodies \u2013 a process by which \nconformity assessment bodies are examined for independence, competence and skill,  \namong other things (IEC 2008). The \u2018accreditors\u2019, who usually receive their authority from  \ngovernment, use this process to assure confidence and mutual recognition of accreditations \nin the food value chains.   \nAn increased role and responsibility for consumers  \nAn effective and efficient control and management of food safety requires the concerted  \nefforts of industry, government regulators, academia and consumers. Previously, a lot of  \nemphasis was placed on what governments had to do to assure food safety. Recent  \ndevelopments recognise the role of consumers (Hanak et al., 2000) and the private sector as  \nessential. The consumer\u2019s role in food safety is threefold: handling and using food in the \nappropriate manner, being at the receiving end of potential health risks in value chains, and \nplaying an advocacy and watchdog role in the regulatory process. Through the third role, \nconsumers provide information to regulators on food safety. Consumer representation on \ndecision making and policy is particularly significant in the UK. There are specialist consumer  \norganisations which focus exclusively on both general consumer and sectoral interest, which  \nmay be formed by government, with specific statutory status (Simmonds, 2002); and others \nare established by non-governmental organisations.  Consumer bodies are involved in \nmeetings of national or international technical committees, during the standards  \ndevelopment process, to ensure that the regulations developed conform to standards that \naddress issues of concern to consumers.  \n3. Public and private regulation of food safety in the UK  \nThe control and management of food safety in the UK has been realised through \npartnerships of both the public and private sector (fig. 1). Major stakeholders include \nnational government, non-governmental sector bodies, special interest groups and value \nchain actors. Food safety assurance is achieved through two main routes: private regulation \nand statutory regulation of the food industry. Statutory regulation controlling food is \nprimarily to protect the health of consumers and prevent fraud (Tansey and Worsley, 1995).  \nThese goals are achieved by a combination of the Food Safety Act 1990 as amended (similar \nversions available for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales), which is the primary regulation \nfor food safety, and secondary regulations and  Directives, issued by the European Union.  \n[Take in Figure (No.1)] \nThe Act, regulations and Directives are used to constrain the behaviour of actors in the food  \nvalue chain, and implement policies that serve consumer interests. These statutory  \nregulations also spell out behaviours, mechanisms for enforcing them, and sanctions to be  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n6 \n \napplied. According to the Food Safety Act 1990, retailers have an obligation to exercise \u2018due  \ndiligence\u2019 to assure food safety.  This \u2018due diligence\u2019 defence protects consumers, and  \nshields traders from being convicted, in the event of crisis, if they have taken all reasonable  \nprecaution and exercised all due dilligence to avoid committing the offence.   \nPrivate regulation of food safety is linked to the trend of major retailer development of  \nown-brand range of food products (Lawrence et al., 2002). To ensure that suppliers of  \nretailers are not exposed to product liability, a system was required to ensure \u2018due  \ndiligence\u2019 in safety procedures. This was necessary so that in the event of criminal or civil \nprosecution against the retailer, there will be proof that \u2018due diligence\u2019 has either been \nfollowed or not. Retailers developed in-house food technology departments in the 1980s to  \nmonitor their own-brand food supply lines and visited their suppliers, giving technical  \nadvice. In the 1990s, retailers advised suppliers to use third party auditors, approved by \nthem to audit their safety systems. As a result of concerns raised about the variations \ncharacterising the different requirements and the approaches to third party auditing,  \nconsensus was reached by British retailers, on a common minimum standard for food \nsafety. This was to provide third party auditors with a common basis with which to provide \n\u2018due diligence\u2019 defence for retailers. Coming along these developments was the introduction \nof the BRC standard in 1998, to specify the basic minimum requirement for food safety.  \nPresently, other standards are being adopted for use by British retailers, which also specify \nthe minimum basic requirements for food safety acceptable by relevant stakeholder, at the \ndifferent functional nodes in value chains.  \nDrivers for, benefits of and challenges to compliance with food safety regulations   \nCompliance with food safety regulation has become a ticket for accessing the global food \nvalue chain. The past few decades have seen significant new developments (section two \nabove) that have tightened controls in different countries. In response, the interest of most  \nresearchers in this research community has shifted to understanding the evolving  \ncompetitive landscape as a result of these new developments, and examining the response \nof enterprises to food safety regulation from different geographical positions, to improve \npolicy decisions that will benefit both small and medium enterprises (SMES) and larger  \nenterprises. The environmental and quality literature is fairly grounded in terms of the role  \nof regulation in assuring environmental sustainability (see Rugman and Verbeke, 1998a & b)  \nand product quality, the drivers, benefits and challenges to compliance, and the food safety \nliterature is increasingly drawing on these two perspectives to inform explanations to the \nresponse of enterprises to food safety regulation, and how it affects enterprises. However, \nLoader and Hobbs, (1999) suggest that enterprise response to food safety regulation may be  \ndifferent to other forms of regulation because of the sensitive nature of food safety issues \nand the immense perceived importance of them. In spite of this, in all three types of \nregulations (environmental, quality and food safety), enterprises are expected to take action  \nin order to protect the environment, public health and safety. The wealth of literature  \navailable gives insights into the behaviour of enterprises, which suggest that the response of  \nenterprises is not automatic; it reflects the interplay among different types of incentives \noperating at the level of mandated government regulation, pressure from the markets and  \nliability laws (Jayasinghe-Mudalige and Henson, 2007; Khatri, and Collins, 2007; Henson and  \nHooker, 2001). Whether enterprises respond in a positive or negative manner depends on a  \nvariety of factors e.g. sector, enterprise size, financial situation and level of risk adversity  \n(see table 2). Further, the impact of these incentives on the enterprise is dependent on their  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n7 \n \nperception of costs and benefits of compliance or non-compliance. From existing studies, it  \nis apparent that regulation is a very important incentive for compliance in most countries  \nand the degree of enforcements could cause even the smallest of enterprises to comply  \nwithout question.   \n[Take in Table 2] \nSuccessful implementation factors \nA variety of studies have studied the impact of implementing an integrated food safety  \nmanagement system in countries e.g. Canada (Jayasinghe-Mudalige and Henson, 2007), Italy \n(Romano et al., 2004) and Australia (Khatri, and Collins, 2007), in different sectors e.g. \ncatering, meat and poultry processing, without necessarily examining what ensures \nsuccessful implementation. This is indicative of the fact that there is paucity of research on \nrelevant factors to consider for successful implementation. A myriad of papers have focused \nparticularly on how to implement the HACCP component of international standards without \nconsidering relevant factors to the whole system implementation. Trienekens and Zuurbier \n(2008), however, draw on the quality literature to suggest that adequate information should \nbe available for planning, execution, and monitoring functions. In addition to this  \nmanagement support is also essential for successful implementation. As a result, this paper  \ndraws on empirical evidence to investigate the underlying constructs to influence successful  \nimplementation of integrated FSMSs.  \n4. Methodology  \nA survey methodology was complemented with case studies because the structure of the \nquestionnaire did not allow for a detailed investigation into compliance of enterprises, even  \nthough it allowed for the use of a sample to estimate population characteristics (Wright, \n1997). The findings of the survey were inadequate in themselves to provide detailed  \nexplanations of the responses given and hence case study method was used to make up for  \nthis limitation (Yin, 2009). \nThe study was interested in the institutional arrangements that have impacted on the \ncurrent state of food safety and the response of food manufacturers to food safety \nregulation in the UK Food and Drinks manufacturing sector. The study used certification to  \nfood safety standards as a measure of compliance and as a shift from the dependence on \nperformance-based approaches to integrated approach to food safety management.   \n  \nData collection  \nA review of relevant literature was conducted on developments in food safety control and  \nmanagement in general and particularly, in the UK. A postal survey-based questionnaire was  \nthen designed and administered from May-August, 2009. Postal surveys were employed  \nbecause the details for target respondents were not readily available, however, general  \nenterprise details were hosted by various databases, and hence it was easier executing this  \nphase of the study using this technique. A section was included in the survey-questionnaire  \nto collect details of enterprises which were willing to participate further. By including this  \nsection, which was optional for respondent, the direct contact details of quality managers  \nwas collected to allow for a detailed further investigation using interviews. Three  \nenterprises agreed to take part and hence their quality and technical managers were  \ninterviewed to gain insights and underlying reasons for their responses.  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n8 \n \nResearch instrument \nA structured survey-based questionnaire was developed, drawing on existing literature that  \nstudied the drivers for, benefits of, and challenges to, compliance with food safety  \nregulation in other countries, and the requirements of the ISO 22000 international food  \nsafety standard. The purpose of the research instrument was to explore the impacts of an  \nintegrated food safety management system on enterprises, and investigate empirically, best  \npractices associated with implementation. The questionnaire was divided into three main \nsections:    \n\u2022  the first section dealt with the background of the enterprise in relation to food  \nsafety management systems (food safety standards certified to\n1\n, motivation\n2\n for \ncompliance, benefits\n2\n of compliance, and challenges\n2\n to compliance with food safety \nregulation). An open ended question was included in this section to request for  \ninformation on the mode of dealing with the topmost challenge.   \n\u2022  The section also asked respondents to rate a range of factors in relation to their \ncontribution to successful design, implementation and continuous improvement of \nfood safety management systems, indicate their mode for developing food safety \nmanagement systems and equipping personnel with food safety competences.  \n\u2022  The second section explored food safety management system design, \nimplementation and continuous improvements (management responsibility,  \nresources management, planning and realisation of safe products); however, the  \nresults of this section are not presented here, because they are being used to form  \nthe basis for further detailed investigations. The third section concerned the  \ncharacteristics of the company: ownership structure, factory size in terms of number \nof employees and respondent details. The survey-based questionnaire was reviewed  \nby three researchers in other disciplines of study and piloted with a specialist in the \nfield of food safety management. \nA semi-structured interview script was used to gain further insights into responses given in \nthe survey. The questions were standardised to increase interviewer consistency (Fowler,  \n2002).   \nSample for survey  \nThe target population was food manufacturing enterprises, which was drawn from FAME,  \ncourtesy Cranfield University Library Resource. FAME is a database that contains  \ninformation of enterprises (e.g. trading addresses, phone numbers, and websites) in the UK  \nand Ireland. The target population contains both animal feed producers and human food  \nmanufacturers. Within this target population, the sample frame of interest is the human  \nfood manufacturers. Out of the 3.4 million enterprises hosted by the database, search  \ncriteria were used to narrow down to relevant enterprises in the sample frame. The criteria  \ncomprised: type of industry, industry location and status. The search string used was the UK  \nStandard Industrial Classification of Economic Activity, SIC (2003), all Category 15, which \nrepresents \u201cmanufacture of food products and beverages\u201d. A total of 6553 enterprises  \nfitting these criteria were exported to Excel. The filtering tool in Excel was used to eliminate  \nmanufacturers of animal feed, dormant enterprises, and enterprises that did not specify the  \n                                                \n \n1\n Respondents could select more than one option. \n2\n Respondents were to select topmost five. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n9 \n \ndescription of their products. A total of 3124 enterprises fitting the set criteria remained.  \nThis data was manually cleaned to remove duplications, retailers, distributors and  \nenterprises providing financial services to food enterprises. Stratified sampling was used to  \nselect participant, aiming to ensure that the final sample was a good representation of the \ndifferent sub-categories (e.g. dairy-based product manufacturers, manufacturers of fruits \nand vegetables, bakeries, poultry processors) within the sample frame. A final random \nsample of 500 food manufacturing enterprises fitting the criteria set out was selected for \nmailing.  The decision to use 500 stemmed from resource constrains. A total of 37 (7.4%) \nmailed questionnaires were returned unopened, because enterprises had either moved  \naddresses or were no longer in operation. The total number of responses received was 120, \nrepresenting approximately 26% of the final sample (463).  \nCase Studies \nThe three cases used for further investigation were arrived at on the basis of who was \nwilling to participate, and were drawn from the sample that was used for the survey. All \nthree enterprises were SMEs, certified to the BRC standard and privately owned. The  \nenterprises serviced international markets in addition to the UK market and have been in \nbusiness for at least 20 years.  One was an intermediary food processor and two were \nmanufacturers of ready to eat food products.  \nAnalysis  \nThe responses received were manually entered into a workbook in Microsoft Excel and \nprepared for analysis. The prepared data was then imported into SPSS 17.0. The descriptive  \ncharacteristics of the data were computed for various responses and interpreted based on  \nemerging trends from the analysis.  The data of categorical nature were analysed using the  \nChi-square statistical technique to identify differences in the groups of respondents (SMEs  \nand large enterprises). Alpha (\u03b1) was set to 0.05 (Wright, 1997). Cramer\u2019s V was used to  \ninvestigate the strength of the effects of size of enterprise on the drivers, benefits and  \nchallenges to compliance.   \nFactor analysis was conducted on the variables that influence the success of FSMS  \nimplementation, to identify underlying constructs that are most important. Cronbach\u2019s  \nalpha was used to assess the internal consistency reliability for the overall scale of  \nmeasurement and for individual elements within the scale.   \nResponses to the open-ended question were clustered to identify emerging themes. The  \nresponses received from the interviews were transcribed and descriptively analysed (Miles  \nand Humberman, 1994). Conclusions were then drawn based on the outcome of the  \nfindings and analysis.   \n5. Results \nThis section presents the results of the empirical survey of the UK Food and Drinks sector.   \nProfile of respondents \nThe European Commission's definition of enterprises, in terms of number of employees \n(European Commission, 2003) was adopted. Approximately 54% of enterprises that  \nresponded to the survey belonged to the SME category (table.3) and 46% were large  \nenterprises. Privately owned enterprises made up the largest of the responses (table .4).   \n  \n[Take in Table 3]  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n10 \n \n[Take in Table 4] \nResponse to Food Safety Regulation  \nMajority (97.5%) of enterprises that responded to the survey had an integrated food safety  \nmanagement system (FSMS) in place.  Three enterprises (2.5%) did not have any FSMS in \nplace; nonetheless, these enterprises had one of the ISO 9000 series implemented. The first  \nenterprise was a subsidiary of a multinational enterprise, manufacturing beverages, had  \nbeen in business for many decades and hence had an established market. The last two  \nenterprises were corporations, manufacturing malt for brewers. 87% of enterprises had a  \nthird party certified FSMS implemented. The BRC global food safety standard turned out to  \nbe the most popular amongst the different standards implemented by UK food enterprises \n(fig. 2). Approximately 78% of enterprises had the BRC\u2019s global food safety standard in  \nplace. Approximately 6% of enterprises had two food safety standards implemented. 11% of \nenterprises had their own version of food safety management system in place. Even though  \nISO 22000 has been introduced for approximately five years now, the standard and the IFS  \nwere less popular with UK enterprises. Seven enterprises were certified to the ISO 22000  \nstandard and three enterprises were certified to the IFS. \n                                                       [Take in Figure (No.2)]  \nMotivations for compliance  \nApproximately 81% of enterprises claimed that they were driven by the prospects of  \nproduct safety improvement, 76% were driven by customer requirements and 60% were \ndriven by regulatory requirements. The survey also revealed that 59% of enterprises were \ndriven by the expected marketing advantage that could be derived from implementing the \nstandard, others, 54% saw the potential for improved corporate image and 38% claimed  \nthat their certification was motivated by the fact that their competitors were certified. Only \n35% of enterprises complied because of potential liability claim. 30% were driven by the \nprospect of operational cost reductions. Approximately 18% of the enterprises claimed that \nthey complied to avoid potential export barriers from overseas customers, and because it \nwas an insurance requirement (see fig. 3).    \n[Take in Figure (No.3)]  \n  \nBenefits of compliance   \nThis study also investigated the perceived benefits of complying with food safety  \nrequirements in the UK Food and Drinks sector. The findings are represented in fig.  4. From  \nthe chart, 85% of the respondents enjoyed the benefit of increased customer satisfaction. \n83% of respondents claimed improved internal procedures and 82% of the respondents also  \nclaimed improvements in product quality.  \n[Take in Figure (No.4)]  \nApproximately 72% also claimed that implementing a food safety management system  \nfacilitated compliance with regulatory requirements. Less than 30% of enterprises claimed  \nbenefits relating to market access, reduced operating cost and lower insurance charges. \nOnly one enterprise claimed no benefits were received from complying with food safety  \nrequirements.  \nDeveloper of food safety management system  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n11 \n \nDeveloping, implementing and continually improving food safety management systems \nrequire the effort of all employees in an enterprise to be effective and efficient. The various  \nstages of the process require particularly relevant competencies. Enterprises have three \noptions to adopt when developing and implementing a FSMS:  \n\u2022  developing the system in-house; \n\u2022  inviting a consultant to develop the system, while providing him with the necessary  \nresources; \n\u2022   or jointly developing the system, while making use of both in-house personnel and a  \nconsultant.  \n According to the survey, most enterprises (77%) developed their systems in-house, 21% \nrespondents claimed their system was jointly developed with a consultant, and 2% \nrespondent handed over the whole process to a consultant. From these findings, a higher  \nneed exists for employees involved in the development and implementation of a FSMS to be \ntechnically competent as most enterprises are tending to develop their food safety \nmanagement systems in-house.  \nChallenges to compliance  \nThe challenges hindering compliance of enterprises to FSMSs are three-fold (fig. 5):  \nfinancial, infrastructural and people related. The study identified five topmost challenges as:  \nlack of technical knowledge and skill of employees (58%), employee resistance to change \n(58%), lack of awareness of the requirement (40%), high cost of development and  \nimplementation (26%), inappropriate infrastructural capabilities for validating and verifying  \nFSMS 30%.   \n[Take in Figure (No.5)] \nMode of overcoming topmost challenge  \nIn response to the open question of how enterprises overcome their topmost challenge s \nhindering compliance with food safety regulation, 40 enterprises (63%) out of the 64 that  \nresponded said they implemented interventions that increased the knowledge and  \ncompetence of their workforce, by increasing their training budget, implementing internal  \ntraining and knowledge sharing schemes, and implementing a training department (See fig.  \n6). 10% of enterprises said they implemented interventions that altered the existing culture  \nwithin their enterprises. Approximately 8% of respondents said they improved \ncommunication in relation to awareness of food safety requirements and how it affects  \neach employee\u2019s job description.  The remaining percentage (42%) was accounted for by  \nother respondents who suggested that they invested in equipment and software packages \nfor the management of food safety, implemented standard operating procedures and  \ndocumented their plan of action to increase the consistency of procedures, which will have  \na direct impact on food safety in the enterprise.  \n[Take in Figure (No.6)]  \nSuccessful implementation factors   \nThe variables underlying the factors that influenced successful implementation of FSMS  \nwere ranked using a five point Likert scale, where 1, represented \u2018unimportant\u2019 and 5,  \nrepresented \u2018very important\u2019. The overall reliability of the scale of measurement was 0.835,  \nand that for individual elements ranged between 0.81 and 0.83, which is sufficiently high  \n(Nunnaly, 1978). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic was 0.833, which indicates that  \nfactor analysis is appropriate and hence should yield distinct and reliable factors (Field,  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n12 \n \n2005).The correlation matrix yielded item-total correlations from 0.101 and 0.649. Since  \nnone of the correlation coefficients were 0 or particularly high, all variables were included in \nthe principle component analysis (PCA). The results are shown in table 5). The PCA shows  \nthat the first four components explained approximately 64% of the total variance and had  \nEigen values of more than 1, and hence were selected for further analysis (Field, 2005).The  \nvarimax rotation suggested an optimum, interpretable  four-factor solution, suppressing  \nfactors  with values  < 0.5. This loading show that there are four factors and variables load  \nvery highly onto one factor, factor 4 (table 6).   \n  \n6. Analysis and discussion   \nThe study reveals a great deal of regulatory interventions by government and the private  \nsector, which were enacted to increase transparency, traceability, consumer confidence in  \nfood safety, and protect consumer health and safety. The statutory regulatory approach was  \nparticularly deemed necessary because of the nature of food, it being a post- experience \ngood (Weimer, and Vining, 1992) and the inability of consumers to determine its safety  \nbefore purchase or consumption due to information asymmetry.  Regulators, therefore, saw \nthe need to step in to protect consumers. By so doing, it was hoped that the potential \ndevastating effects of food safety failures could be avoided. These efforts have seen an  \nincreased responsibility of major stakeholders in the food value chain (The Strategy Unit,  \n2008). Enterprises have responded to stringent regulations by complying with international  \nfood safety standards, through process-based, integrated food safety management  \napproaches and getting audited by third party auditing institutions, while still using \nperformance-based approaches to verify specific levels of certain food safety hazards. \nMotivation for, and benefits of compliance  \nThe push for regulation on an integrated food safety management approach is primarily on \nthe basis of the perceived degree of assurance it gives, towards the protection of public  \nhealth, and the increased transparency it introduces into food value chains. How enterprises \nrespond is, however, dependent on their strategic orientation, the nature of drivers, and the  \nperceived industrial and economic benefits. For enterprises that are domestic oriented,  \ncompliance would normally be to domestic regulation only, however, in the UK, domestic  \nregulation has been aligned with regional and international regulation, and the means of  \ndemonstrating compliance to UK customers requires that food manufacturers get certified \nto an international food safety standard. It is evident from the study that regulation  is a  \nsignificant driver for enterprises complying, even though product safety improvements  \nturned out top of the list of drivers. This is reflected in the opinions of food manufacturers  \non the role both statutory  and private regulation has played in enhancing food safety in the  \nUK. Some manufacturers believe that the current status of food safety could still have been  \nrealised, even without statutory regulation. According to these enterprises, regulations,  \nespecially statutory regulations are unnecessary, bureaucratic, and add no more value to  \nassuring food safety. Because of the dynamic nature of the food industry, regulations make  \nit difficult to rapidly respond to these changes. Furthermore, the regulations are biased  \ntowards the consumer, without due assessments of the costs it imposes on industry. On the  \nother hand, other manufacturers believe that because of the significant work and costs  \ninvolved in complying with food safety regulations, most enterprises would not have  \ncomplied to their current degree if there were no stringent external incentives. There is a  \nconsensus, however, on the benefits derived from compliance. This is reflected in the \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n13 \n \nbenefits enterprises gained, as compliance with food safety regulation put them in good \nstanding with both immediate customers and the statutory regulations that govern both \nnational and global value chains. Enterprises claimed improvements in operating  \nprocedures, which is reflected in their responsiveness to internal food safety issues; a \nfriendlier, trust worthy culture has been created and transparency is increasingly being  \nfostered, through the use of multifunctional teams. Comparing the factors that motivated  \nSMEs to factors that motivated large enterprises revealed two top factors common to both \ngroups (product safety improvements, customer requirement).  The Chi-square analysis \nrevealed that there is no statistical significant effect of size of enterprise on the drivers of \ncompliance in the UK. Similar results were identified for the benefits of compliance. \nHowever, one benefit item proved to be statistically significant, improved product safety. \nThis means that, one can say with certainty that size of enterprises has an effect on the  \nbenefit \u2018improved product safety\u2019. Since Chi-square did not indicate the strength of this  \neffect, Cramer\u2019s V (Morgan et al, 2007) was used to estimate the strength. The value was  \n0.206, which was quite weak. This implies that  there is at least an observed  \ndifference,which is statistically sigificant; however it may not be of any practical importance.   \nChallenges to compliance  \nThe topmost challenge enterprises faced in their quest to implement integrated food safety \nmanagement systems was people related. This is partly attributed to the low level of \neducation and training of employees related to food safety management systems.  This  \nchallenge is logical as most enterprises (73%) developed and implemented their food safety \nmanagement systems in-house, making use of their own employees. As the generic  \nknowledge and competence for manufacturing is inadequate in itself to develop and  \nimplement FSMS, a competency gap is created. This gap, if ignored could create resistant  \nculture; morales would drop and implementation would be in sabotaged. This is reflected in \nthe number of enterprises who said employee resistance to change was one of their  \ntopmost challenges.  In addition to the regular short training courses to increase knowledge  \nof workforce on food safety, additional knowledge is required for professionals that \nmaintain and continually improve the system in the disciplines of food microbiology and  \nfood chemistry. However, SMEs cannot afford the services of such professionals with the \nskills to develop, implement and maintain an integrated FSMS.   \nThe financial related challenges arose from the costs involved in developing, implementing  \nand continually maintaining a food safety management system. Some of these costs arise  \nfrom the regular refresher training for all staff members and occasional specialised training \nfor specific quality staff. Other costs arise from the regular audits at planned intervals, to \ndetermine whether a food safety system conforms to planned arrangements and is \neffectively implemented and updated regularly.   \nAccording to enterprises, the most unnecessary of these costs are those arising from the  \ncustomers who turn up aside scheduled visits, as enterprises have to pay huge sums per  \neach day of visit.  \nA major challenge came from getting the right infrastructural capacity to plan and  \nimplement the processes needed for validating control measures, and verifying the  \neffectiveness of the system developed. Consequently, external agencies are contracted for  \nvalidation and verifications. Here again, SMEs suffer the most because they are not able to \nenjoy the economies of scale provided by bulk rates from outsourced laboratory testing \nservices (Loader and Hobbs, 1999). These findings are consistent with the work of Yapp and \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n14 \n \nFairman (2006), Fairman and Yapp, (2004) and Taylor, (2001) and are valid both in the case  \nof large and small enterprises. However, they are particularly true for SMEs because of their  \nlimited access to information, knowledge and competency to interpret regulatory  \ndocuments. As a result, enterprises with limited resources face significant challenges. The  \nsurvey found out that the challenges faced by larger enterprises are not so different from \nthe challenges to compliance faced by SMEs, however, the limited capability and resources  \nof SMEs makes compliance a heavy burden. However, since compliance to food safety  \nregulation is increasingly becoming mandatory in global value chains, and sustaining food  \nsafety in the value chain is dependent on these SMEs (who are the weakest links), it is  \nessential that efforts be made to facilitate compliance of SMEs to food safety regulation.  \nGovernment cold step in to provide financial related incentives to SMEs in particular. Public  \ninstitutions could be set up that provide services related to validation and verification of  \nfood safety systems at costs that are affordable. Enterprises agree that the training offered  \nby Environmental Health Officers are  more affordable, however, they are biased towards  \nmicrobiology, which is sometimes not beneficial for all, and hence, an improved, more \ntargeted training, specific to sub-sectors would be more appropriate. For enterprises that \ndecide to develop and implement the system in-house, management must ensure that  \nemployees involved in the process have the requisite competences and skill sets, to enhance  \nmorale, which will in turn increase the chances of success of implementation. Testing the  \nnull hypothesis between SMEs and large enterprises revealed that even though in practice  \nthere seems to be a difference between these two groups, the responses indicate that there  \nis no statistical significance difference between the challenges faced by SMEs and large  \nenterprises in the UK.  \nSuccessful implementation factors  \nThe factor structure suggested by factor analysis indicates that the first success factor has 4 \nitems (n = 4) and that relates to the involvement and recognition of relevant stakeholders.  \nThe second factor also has four items (N = 4) and that relates to continually upgrading  \nsystems and people, and standardising procedures. The third factor has two items (n = 2)  \nwhich relate to equipping employees with the competences to manage food safety both \nwithin the internal and external value chain. The final factor is top management \ncommitment. The fourth factor was the most highly loaded and in theory, represents the  \nfirst hurdle to overcome before actual development and implementation begins. For some \nenterprises, it is management that pushes for food safety certifications or compliance.  \nUnder this particular circumstance, the first hurdle of getting top-level management \ninvolved would have been overcome. However, for other advocates, other than top  \nmanagement, it is essential to gain the commitment of top management, as the  \nrequirements for most international food safety standards explicitly state the requirements  \nfor management (BS EN ISO 22000, 2005). Therefore, ignoring the role of top management  \nwould be condemning the whole process to failure.   \n7.0 Conclusions \nFood safety has become a sensitive and global issue; from recent developments in the \nglobal food industry, there is no way around it without suffering the consequences of non- \ncompliance, regardless of whether both industrial or economic benefits are realised by  \nenterprises or not. Even in the face of significant challenges to enterprises and the  \nreservations of some enterprises about the regulatory process and the role of regulation in  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n \n \n15 \n \nensuring food safety, statutory regulation enhances compliance of enterprises with food  \nsafety requirements.  \nConsumer safety is paramount when it comes to food safety regulation; however, regulators  \nneed to conduct due assessments of food safety risks on consumers, and the cost  \nimplications of enforcement strategies on industry, to mitigate costs incurred by industry, \nwithout compromising consumer safety.  \n  \nReferences  \n   \nBS EN ISO 22000 (2005), \"Food safety management systems - requirements for any  \norganisation in the food value chain\".   \nCIES (2007), \"What is ISO 22000?\", GFSI Technical Committee Position Paper, [Online], , pp. \n7\/09\/2009 available at: http:\/\/www.ciesnet.com\/2-wwedo\/2.2- \nprogrammes\/2.2.foodsafety.gfsi.asp.   \nEuropean Commission (2003), \"Commission recommendation of 6th May 2003 on the  \ndefinition of micro, smal and medium-sized enterprises\", Journal of European Union,   \npp. 1-6.   \nFairman, R. and Yapp, C.
