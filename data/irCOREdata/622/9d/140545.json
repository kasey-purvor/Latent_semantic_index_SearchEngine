A\nsmaller number have investigated the indirect effects on\nlivestock produced by changes in the survival of\npathogens, disease vectors and parasites. Some have\nalso considered the effects of changes in forage crop\nproductivity and seasonality; the project funded by the\nScottish Of\u00aece Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries\nDepartment (MacKerron 1996) is of particular relevance.\nHowever, few, if any, have considered the impact of\nclimate change on livestock production systems through\nboth the direct effects of temperature stress and indirect\neffects through forage production.\nThe objectives of this paper and its companion\n(Parsons et al. 2000) are to indicate the likely changes in\nthe sustainability of different enterprises across England\nand Wales and to attempt to draw conclusions about\npossible changes in regional patterns of agricultural land\nuse that may result. Thus models have been created of\nlivestock systems using, as far as possible, existing\nsubmodels of the component processes, which are then\napplied across a range of geographical and climatological\nscenarios.\nThis paper describes the component models for\nintensive livestock systems and how they were inte-\ngrated. The components are livestock feeding, thermal\nbalances of pigs and poultry, and controlled environ-\nment building and a stochastic weather generator. The\nresults are presented and the possible implications are\ndiscussed.\nComponent models\nGrowing pig feeding model\nThe growing pig model is based on the one described by\nStranks et al. (1988). The ability of the pig to grow is based\non its protein deposition rate, which is dependent on the\nbreed and sex of the pig. The model simulates the growth\nof the pig from a weight of around 20 kg until it reaches\nits target weight, using the factorial approach (ARC\n1981).\nCorrespondence: fax + 44\/ 1525 860156, e-mail david.parsons@\nbbsrc.ac.uk\nGlobal Change Biology (2001) 7, 163\u00b1170\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd 163\nThe pig has a metabolizable energy (ME) intake (or\nappetite),\nE \u0088 2:0w0:63;\nwhere E is the intake (MJ day\u00b11) and w is the liveweight\n(kg). This intake will be used for maintenance and\ngrowth. The energy used for the growth of the pig is split\nbetween that used for protein and fat deposition,\nx \u0088\nX\nEi \u0088\nX ei\nki\nfor i \u0088 m; p; f\nwhere m is maintenance, p is protein and f is fat. The ei\nare the net energy requirements, the Ei are the feed ME\nrequirements and the ki are the conversion ef\u00aeciencies.\nThe ME used for maintenance is\nem \u0088 0:719w0:63:\nThe ef\u00aeciency (km) is taken to be 1.0, because all energy\nfor maintenance is ultimately converted to heat.\nThe protein deposition rate, Dwp (g day\u00b11), varies\naccording to\nDwp \u0088 D \u00c3wp \u00ff 0:95w\u00850:5D \u00c3wp \u00ff 25\u0086\nwhere Dwp is the maximum protein deposition rate,\ntypically in the range 110\u00b1130 g day\u00b11. The energy\nrequired to deposit the protein is\nep \u0088 24:7Dwp;\nwith ef\u00aeciency, kp = 0.54. Now, by using the equation\nabove, the surplus energy, ef to be used for fat deposition\ncan be calculated. Fat is deposited at a rate Dwf, which\ndepends on ef, available:\nDwf \u0088\nef\n39:7kf\nwhere ef\u00aeciency, kf = 0.75.\nThe model computes the daily liveweight gain of the\npig by evaluating the various components: protein, ash,\nwater and fat. Initially the pig's contents are\nwp \u0088 0:165w0;wa \u0088 0:116w0;ww \u0088 1:02w0:8650 ;\nwhere w0 is the empty-body weight, wa is the ash and ww\nis the water content and the remainder of the initial\nempty-body weight is fat. The pig is assumed to have\nundigested food in its gut at all times, so the total weight\nof the pig is 1.1 w0.\nNow each day the pig will gain protein and fat as\nshown in the equations above, and the ash gain rate is\n0:21Dwp:\nThe water content throughout is,\nww \u0088 4:85w0:865p :\nIt is assumed that the energy deposited as body tissue is\nretained.

Broilers\ntypically grow from their hatching weight of about 45 g\nto a mature weight of 2.5\u00b13 kg in about 6\u00b17 weeks.\nThe growing weights from six commercial broiler\nstocks (Hancock et al. 1995) were analysed and the\nfollowing formula was \u00aetted to the data\nw \u0088 5:305exp\u0085\u00ffexp\u0085\u00ff0:00341\u0085t\u00ff 42:72\u0086\u0086\u0086 \u00ff 0:0278;\nwhere t is the age in days since hatching and w is the\nweight of the chicken (kg). The weight of gut contents,\nwg, varies as the chicken grows. The following expression\nwas \u00aetted to the data on gut \u00aell from Hancock et al. (1995)\nwg \u0088 \u00850:00281t\u0087 0:0168\u0086w t \u0014 220:076w t > 22\n\u001a\nThe body of the chicken is partitioned into its various\ncomponents of ash, protein, lipid and water in order to\ncalculate the energy requirements. The rate of increase of\nbody protein is\nDwp \u0088 0:18183Dwd;\nwhere wd is the empty gut weight of the chicken. The\nother components are related to the protein weight: ash\nwa \u0088 0:21wp\nwater (Emmans 1981)\nww \u0088 wp\u00852:96\u00ff 0:3ln\u0085wp=Wp\u0086\u0086;\nwhere Wp is the mature protein weight, typically\n0.795 kg, and lipid, which is the remainder of the weight:\nwf \u0088 wd \u00ff wp \u00ff wa \u00ff ww\nThe energy used for growth and maintenance is now\ncalculated.

The energy required\nfor fat and protein growth is 39.1 and 23.7 MJ kg\u00b11,\nrespectively, with ef\u00aeciencies kf = 0.7, kp = 0.4. The ME for\nmaintenance (MJ day\u00b11) is,\nem \u0088 0:45w0:75;\nand the maintenance protein is\npm \u0088 0:00233w2=3;\nwhere the maintenance protein, pm (kg day\n\u00b11), requires\nenergy emp at the same rate as protein growth.\n164 J .

The same energy balance relationships, based on\nthe principles of heat transfer, were used, and the\noutputs were the energy requirement for a speci\u00aeed\nhourly period, and a quanti\u00aecation of the degree of\nthermal stress suffered, given the meteorological condi-\ntions.\nPigs were modelled as long round-ended cylinders\nrepresenting head and body, with vertical cylinders\nrepresenting legs. The pig coat, which is usually sparse,\nwas ignored, and the resulting two-layer energy balance\nmodel was much simpler to solve than the three-layer\nmodel for outdoor animals. Chickens were modelled as\nspherical bodies with cylindrical legs and neck. The\nresistance to heat transfer of the body tissue and feathers\nwas taken as a single value, thereby reducing the chicken\nto a simple two-layer model. The legs, neck and head\nwere assumed bare, with appropriate values of the tissue\nresistance to simulate the vasomotor response in the\ncomb, wattles and feet to the environmental conditions.\nDetailed descriptions of the model design and discus-\nsions of the implications can be found in Turnpenny\n(1997) and Turnpenny et al. (2000 a,b).\nSolar radiation was assumed to be zero for animals\nindoors. Input values of microclimate variables such as\nair speed and radiant temperature of the environment in\nthe building were obtained from the model of the\nbuilding energy balance (see section below). The build-\ning microclimate is therefore linked to the outdoor\nclimate by the building heat balance. Humidity in the\nbuilding is affected by the latent heat \u00afux from the\nanimals. The mass \u00afux of water vapour from the animals\nand, hence, the change in humidity inside the building,\nwere calculated by the model from the latent heat \u00afux.\nOther important considerations in modelling the\nthermal balance of animals indoors are conduction of\nheat to the ground and to other animals. The current\nmodel estimated conductivities from the work by Bruce\n& Clark (1979), who used a comprehensive model of pig\nenergy balance. The pig indoors can lose 15% of its heat\nthrough conduction to the \u00afoor (Mount 1967). Bruce &\nClark proposed that the heat \u00afux to the \u00afoor was\nproportional to the difference between deep body and\nambient temperatures, and inversely proportional to the\nresistance of the \u00afoor material, r\u00afoor. This is an important\ninput as the insulation provided by concrete is approxi-\nmately one-sixth that of deep straw. Bruce & Clark also\nproposed a semiempirical scheme to allow for conduc-\ntion from one animal to another, where the area of one\nanimal in contact with other animals is proportional to\nN \u00b1 (1\/N), where N is the number of animals housed\ntogether. The estimate of contact area does not include a\ntemperature dependence, which is a major failing of the\nmodel, as pigs (and chicks) use huddling to prevent\nexcessive heat loss in the cold.\nA thermal balance model of a controlled environment\nbuilding\nIn general, pigs and poultry are kept in controlled-\nenvironment buildings all year round. Their microcli-\nmate is regulated closely for temperature, light and\nventilation. Within an animal's thermoneutral zone\nmetabolic heat production and energy expenditure are\nminimal and the animal is assumed `thermally comfor-\ntable'. The zone is bounded by the lower critical\ntemperature (LCT) and the upper critical temperature\n(UCT). The animals will also become stressed thermally\nif the humidity in the building is too high. The lower\ncritical temperatures for day old and mature pigs and\nchickens are shown in Table 1 (Clark & McArthur 1994).\nCharles (1981) recommends housing pigs at 3K above\ntheir lower critical temperature. The recommended\ntemperature for broilers over 3 weeks is 21\u00b0C. The pig's\nLCT depends on its age, growth rate and the building's\n\u00afoor material. The following equation was \u00aetted for the\nLCT of pigs fed at three times maintenance and housed\non concrete slats,\nTLC \u0088 16exp\u00ff0:04w\u0087 282;\nwhere w is the pig's live weight (kg) and TLC is the lower\ncritical temperature (K).\nThere are two ventilation limits needed for a controlled\nenvironment building (Table 2). The maximum ventila-\ntion requirement is the amount of air necessary to\nTable 1. Values of lower critical temperature for different\nclasses of animal\nAnimal Mass (kg) Age\/other comments LCT (\u00b0C)\nPiglet 2 30\nPig 100 Intake twice maintenance 19\nChick 0.036 2\u00b16 days 34\nChicken 2.4 1 years 16\nI N T E N S I V E L I V E S T O C K S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 165\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 163\u00b1170\nprevent the building overheating and the minimum\nventilation requirement is the amount of air needed to\nmaintain healthy amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide and\nammonia and suf\u00aeciently reduce the humidity in the\nbuilding. The maximum pig ventilation rate is based on a\n\u00aenishing weight of 100 kg (Randall 1977) whilst that for\nbroilers is based on the weight of a fully grown bird\n(Charles 1981).\nThe model for the thermal balance of the controlled\nenvironment building is similar to the one used by\nCooper et al. (1998) for naturally ventilated buildings. The\nmodel calculates steady-state heat balances every hour.\nLivestock buildings used to house pigs and poultry have\nventilation systems in the buildings in which fans are\ncontrolled automatically such that a desired house\ntemperature is maintained.\nThe temperature of the building is related to the\nambient temperature and ventilation rate by the equa-\ntion,\nQ \u0088 1200VDT \u0087UADT;\nwhere Q is the sensible heat output per animal (W), DT is\nthe temperature lift above the outside temperature (K), V\nis the ventilation rate in m3 s\u00b11 per animal, U is the\naverage thermal transmittance of walls and roof (Wm\u00b12\nK\u00b11) and A is the exposed area of walls and roof per\nanimal in square metres (Charles 1981).\nThe heat output of the animal is calculated in the\nfeeding model. This heat output can be divided into dry\n(sensible) heat and latent heat. The latent heat is the\nevaporative heat loss through panting and sweating by\nthe animal.\nIn the model the temperature of the house is controlled\nby \u00aerst calculating the temperature of the house at\nmaximum and minimum ventilation rates and interpo-\nlating between the two to reach the ventilation rate that\ngives the desired temperature, unless one of the limits is\nreached.\nThe absolute humidity (kg kg\u00b11) of the building is\ncalculated each hour for the building using the equation,\ndhi\ndt\n\u0088 nm\u0085t\u0086\n\u001av\n\u0087 \u0085ho \u00ff hi\u0086Vt\nv\n;\nwhere hi and ho are the internal and outside humidities,\nrespectively, n is the number of animals in the house,\nm(t) is the mass \u00afux of water vapour from one animal,\nand v is the volume of the house.\nSystem model\nModel structure\nIn order to evaluate the performance of livestock systems\nunder future climatic scenarios the individual models\nneeded to be integrated into a system model, known as\nECCLIPS (Effect of Climate Change on Livestock\nProduction Systems). The interaction between the sub-\nmodels is shown in Fig. 1. Each day the animal feeding\nmodel calculates the growth during the day for the\nanimal and its rate of metabolic heat production. The\nweight and heat production rate are then treated as\nconstant throughout that day for the heat balance\nmodels. The building model operates on a time step of\n1 h and is driven by the weather data, the total metabolic\nheat production and the latent heat production to\ncalculate the internal temperature and humidity. The\nlivestock heat balance model uses the metabolic heat\nproduction and environmental information to calculate\nthe rate of heat loss, and hence the degree of heat or cold\nstress.\nAs described above, the building ventilation rate is\nadjusted to keep the temperature in the desired range\nsimulated as far as possible. The systems in the model\nrepresent typical current practice, but an important\nquestion is whether they will be adequate for future\nscenarios. Failures to sustain the lower critical tempera-\nture are not considered by the models, because the future\nclimatic scenarios all contain increased temperatures, so\ncold stress would be expected to be a less frequent\nproblem. More relevant is heat stress, which reduces the\nanimal's appetite and consequently reduces their rate of\ngrowth. As noted in Parsons et al. (2000) it was dif\u00aecult to\n\u00aend suitable experimental data to derive a model, so the\nsame assumption is made here: intake is reduced by 2%\nfor each hour of severe stress, up to a maximum of 16%.\nThe models are run for one year consisting of several\nproduction cycles. The pigs typically reach a slaughter\nweight in 14\u00b115 weeks, so there are about 3\u0089 cycles per\nyear. The poultry require 6\u00b17 weeks with an interval of\n2 weeks between batches, resulting in 6 cycles. All cycles\nwere started on 1 January to use the 1-year sets of data\nproduced by the stochastic weather generator (Parsons\net al. 2000).\nInputs to ECCLIPS\nECCLIPS uses inputs de\u00aened for all the component\nmodels. Any of these inputs can be simply changed by\nTable 2.

The main inputs for\neach of the modules are as follows:\nSystem: Weather dataset, year, duration of run\nBuilding model: Dimensions and orientation of building,\nU-values of walls and roof\nThermal balance model: Length, thermal and mechanical\nproperties of coat or feathers, deep body temperature,\ntissue insulation for parts of the body.\nAnimal feeding model: Number of animals, initial live\nweight, target weight\nOutput\nAll of the component models provide yearly and daily\noutput. The yearly output provides `risk' and `produc-\ntivity' variables. The productivity outputs are yield,\nintake and \u00aenal weight. The risk outputs are the\nfrequency of stress and the number of hours for which\nthe ventilation system at maximum rate cannot control\nthe internal temperature of the house below the level that\ncauses heat stress.\nResults\nThe results are presented for each of the enterprise types\nin a common format: a table of the main variables that\ndescribe the systems, a table of the main performance\nmeasures, and a discussion of the main points. As in the\ncompanion paper (Parsons et al. 2000), the results are\nshown for the IPCC baseline scenario IS92a (IPCC 1992)\nin the year 2050 only, because it was found that the\nvariation between the results of the scenarios was always\nnegligible. In contrast to that paper, only the eastern\nlowland site (Boxworth, Cambridgeshire) is considered,\nbecause topography, soil type and rainfall are unim-\nportant for intensive livestock. Some of the other weather\nvariables that show regional variations, particularly\ntemperature, humidity and windspeed, do have some\neffect and, in this respect, Boxworth represents the worst\ncase, because it has the highest mean temperatures.\nAgain, as far as possible the farming scenarios were\nchosen to re\u00afect typical current practice. The measures of\nheat stress used are indicators of the physiological state\nof the animals and we proceed on the same assumption,\nthat present levels are tolerable, but that substantial\nincreases would be unacceptable. This certainly appears\nto be the case for broilers, where mortality rates already\nincrease during warm summers.\nAll the results are shown as means and standard\ndeviations, but these should not be used for conventional\nsigni\u00aecance tests for two reasons. First, the data are the\nresults of deterministic models acting on data generated\nby stochastic weather generators, so they have unusual\nstatistical properties. Secondly, there are dependencies\nbetween years in the different scenarios, invalidating the\nindependence assumptions on which conventional ana-\nlyses are based. In general, the results obtained actually\nhave greater signi\u00aecance than would be indicated by\nhypothesis testing, because a change in the mean value is\nactually an indication of a change in the whole distribu-\nFig. 1 Schematic of the intensive livestock\nintegrated model\nI N T E N S I V E L I V E S T O C K S Y S T E M S M O D E L S F O R C L I M A T E C H A N G E S T U D I E S 167\n# 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd, Global Change Biology, 7, 163\u00b1170\ntion. Thus, for example, if the variance is unchanged, a\n20% increase in the mean frequency of heat stress also\nimplies a 20% increase in the upper quartile, and so on.\nAs in Parsons et al. (2000), some of the results for key\nvariables are also shown as graphs in which the results\nfor individual years are ranked by the dependent\nvariable, allowing visual assessments of stochastic\ndominance and the relative frequencies of events to be\nmade.\nIntensive pigs\nThe growing pig system is simulated for a year in which\n3.5 crops of pigs are reared. The results are shown in\nTables 3 and 4. The frequency of heat stress increased by\nover 20%, despite an increase in the use of energy for\nventilation of 10%. Figure 2(a) clearly shows the in-\ncreased frequency of stress: it can be observed that the\npresent median is exceeded in all but one of the runs for\n2050. The increased use of energy for ventilation is\nshown in Fig. 2(b). Increased stress resulted in a small\nreduction in total livestock production and concentrate\nintake. Under the climate change scenario the piglets\ntook almost half a day longer to reach their target weight\nas a consequence of the reduction in intake caused by\nheat stress. The livestock produced varied less from year-\nto-year than for the grazing livestock.\nThere was no change in the estimated gross margin per\npiglet because the effect of stress on growth rate was\nsmall. Reducing the growth rate signi\u00aecantly would have\nthe effect of increasing the feed required to reach the\ntarget weight, because the daily maintenance require-\nment must be supplied for a longer period. It is possible\nthat the feedback mechanism in the model from stress to\nintake is too weak, but better data would be required to\nestablish this. It is also dif\u00aecult to quantify the effects that\nan increase of heat stress would have on mortality rate,\nwhich, in an extremely hot year, would signi\u00aecantly\nlower production. If the stocking density were reduced\nsuf\u00aeciently to reduce the level of heat stress to the\npresent value, the gross margin per house would be\nsigni\u00aecantly reduced. The model assumes no provision\nfor wallowing, which could be used to alleviate heat\nstress. Alternatively ventilation could also be improved,\nwhich would require capital investment and could\nincrease the running costs.\nBroiler hens\nThe broiler house is also simulated for one year, so there\nare 6 crops of birds with a changeover time between\ncrops of two weeks. The results are shown in Tables 5\nand 6. The occurrence of warmer temperatures caused\nthe frequency of heat stress of the birds to increase by\nFig. 2 Results of growing pig simulation for 30 years at\nBoxworth, comparing baseline (1997) and modi\u00aeed (2050\nIS92a) climates, ranked by the dependent variable: (a)\nFrequency of severe heat stress; (b) Total energy consumed by\nventilation fans\nTable 3.

However, a better measure\nfor broilers is the frequency with which the temperature\nin the house exceeds the bird's upper critical temperature\nby more than 3 K. This frequency increased by 30%\nunder the climate change scenario, which could lead to\nsubstantially larger mortality rates. Figure 3(c) shows a\nvery similar pattern to that found for pigs: again the\npresent median is exceeded in 29 of the 30 simulations\nfor 2050. The pattern of energy consumption (Fig. 3b) is\nalso similar to that found for pigs. Transforming the\nstress data into a histogram (Fig. 4) makes the shift in the\ndistribution clearer. There was no change in the total\nliveweight production, while each crop of broilers took\nabout a day longer to reach their target weight of 2.2 kg.\nThe comments about modelling the effects of heat stress\nin pigs also apply to broilers. There was a negligible\nchange in the concentrate intake.\nThe gross margin per bird was reduced by less than\n1%, however, this makes no allowances for the increases\nin mortality rate resulting from heat stress, especially in\nyears of extremely high temperatures. A reduction in the\nstocking density of 12% was required to reduce\nfrequency of heat stress to the baseline level. Clearly\nthis would entail a corresponding fall in output.\nAlternatively, because the ventilation was restricted by\nthe capacity of the fans, additional capital investment\ncould be used to improve it. Some producers are already\ninstalling reversible fans or circulation fans in broiler\nhouses to increase convective cooling by raising the air\nspeed.\nDiscussion\nMost of the points discussed in Parsons et al. (2000)\nconcerning the dif\u00aeculty of integrating disparate models\napply to the intensive livestock models also. However, in\nTable 6.

The largest uncertainty in the data was between the\ngrowth rates of modern broilers and those used in earlier\nmetabolic studies which provided parameters for the\nheat balance model.\nBoth this paper and Parsons et al. (2000) have shown\nsmall or negligible changes in the gross margins for the\nenterprises considered, except for the unknown potential\nchanges in mortality rates. In practice, these would be\nobscured by larger economic changes. Even in the short\nterm, in a stable climate, prices are highly variable and\nsubject to external forces, such as world commodity\nprices (as seen in the UK during 1998), the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and the European\nUnion's Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, any\neffects of climate change on cereal prices would have\ndirect consequences for livestock feeds. The implications\nof increased levels of heat stress for health, welfare and\ncapital investment are likely to outweigh the changes in\ngrowth and feeding.\nConclusions\n1 Heat stress is likely to become a serious risk factor\ncausing increased mortality for intensive livestock,\nespecially broilers, unless there is investment in im-\nproved ventilation and cooling systems.\n2 Other than the mortality risk, the changes in gross\nmargin found are negligible compared with those\ninduced by external economic factors.\n3 However, increased capital investment in ventilation\nand cooling systems will probably be needed.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was funded by the UK Ministry of Agriculture,\nFisheries and Food under the Impacts of Climate Change research\nprogramme, as contract CSA2523\/CC0315.\nSome of the weather data used in the development and\nvalidation of the models used in this project were provided by\nthe Meteorological Of\u00aece, Bracknell.\nSPECTRE was provided by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU)\nat the University of East Anglia, and we would like to thank Dr\nDavid Viner of CRU for his advice and assistance in the\ninterpretation of the climatic scenarios.\nWe would also like to thank Anton de Baets, who assisted in\nthe analysis of the results while on placement at Silsoe Research\nInstitute from Wageningen Agricultural University.\nReferences\nARC (1981) The Nutrient Requirements of Pigs.
