Some parts of these systems are still in use at present and \nprove the practical efficiency of Roman hydraulics in the principles acquired from the populations \nliving  in the different regions of the Empire. \nIn Pompeii the urban water supply system stands as a clear example of the Roman planning of urban \ncomplex networks by using small water towers to serve a limited numbers of users. This allowed to \ncontrol the derivations and their maintenance and operated a disconnection from the high pressure \nmains and the low pressure pipes, maintaining a fixed maximum height of water over the final points of \ndischarge. \nConsidering the techniques for pressure reduction as a method to control leakages, this paper examines \nthe ancient Roman water supply system to deduce some applications to modern urban networks built in \nnew establishments. \n \nKEYWORDS \n \nRoman water supply, low pressure water supply systems, pressure control. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe description of the ancient Roman water supply system is contained in some details in the technical \nrecommendations of the Latin writers Vitruvius (De Architectura, VIII, 1997 translation), Plinio the \nElder (Naturalis Historia, XXXVI, 1988 translation) and Frontinus (De Aquaeductu Urbis Romae, 2004 \ncommentary), Curator Aquarum in Rome from 97 A.D. to 106 A.D. \nThe water consumption of Rome couldn\u2019t be satisfied by the extraction from \nthe private and public wells or rainwater harvesting, so Roman kings and \nemperors resorted to tap fresh springs in the outskirts of the city, in the \nRoman Campagna, to bring their freshness to the urban centre. \nThe first aqueduct to be built was Aqua Appia, in 312 B.C.and ten more \nfollowed in 540 years, so that by the time of Frontinus appointment to the \noffice of Curator Aquarum, water in Rome was so abundant that he wrote in \nhis report on Rome water supply assessment : \u201cWith such a quantity of \nstructures dedicated to water, pyramids in comparison seem idle and Greek \nworks, though famous, appear inert\u201d (Op. Cit, Par. 16). \nRemains are still in place and Roman suburban areas as well as the centre \ncan offer astonishing views to the traveller (Figure 1, Aqua Claudia, \nRomavecchia). \n \nFigure 1. Aqua Claudia at Romavecchia, Rome South East outskirts \nMonteleone M.C., Yeung H. and Smith R. (2007). A review of ancient Roman water supply exploring techniques of pressure reduction. \nWater Science & Technology: Water Supply, 7, (1), 113\u2013120. \nTaking baths became an important habit in Roman life, regardless of the social extraction, so an \nincreased water supply was needed: ruins of channels or other structures part of the aqueducts exist in all \nregions of ancient Roman empire (Figure2, Pont du Gard, Nimes, France; Figure 3, Segovia, Spain; \nFigure 4, Merida, Spain). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Pont du Gard, Nimes, France \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Aqueduct of Segovia, Spain \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Aqueduct of Merida, Spain  \n(from Perkins, 1994) \n \nThe construction of the ancient Roman aqueduct system is in some ways not different from the modern \npractice, since often modern technologies descend directly from Roman uses. \nMore over we can learn some useful lessons from those techniques. Let us consider the urban water \nsupply system, whose well known example is the one of Pompeii, as will be described later (Richardson, \n1989). It is based on low pressure areas, were the head of water (pressure in the mains) maintained after \nbeing conducted from the upstream springs is reduced by means of small local tanks elevated on pillars \nand serving a limited number of users. \nIn the view of the modern techniques for water leakage reduction, comprehensive of pressure \ncontainment methods as outlined in IWA perspective (Brothers, 2005, Thornton, 2003 and Thornton et \nal., 2005), and considering the direct relationship between quantity of leaking flow and pressure in the \nmains (Smith, 1999), the small local reservoir system can be assessed as a possible method of serving \nlimited number of customers by means of clean\/ reclaimed water tanks connected to single buildings by \ngravity mains or pumps. \n \n \nTHE ROMAN WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM  \n \nThe idea to which the Romans referred when transporting water down to the city was similar to river \nflow, in fact they called the channel \u201cRivus\u201d.The general scheme as it was used in many cities of the \nRoman Empire is described in figure 5. \n \nMonteleone M.C., Yeung H. and Smith R. (2007). A review of ancient Roman water supply exploring techniques of pressure reduction. \nWater Science & Technology: Water Supply, 7, (1), 113\u2013120. \nFigure 5. The Ancient Roman Water Supply System. \n \nThe search for new springs started as described by Vitruvius (Op.Cit, Book VIII, Chapter 4), to discover \nhow much wholesome was the water; then `water was collected in a basin, to allow sedimentation as \nwell (Mucci, 1995) \nWhen water run in soil stratifications, it was made to permeate trough walls with holes and to flow \ninside a channel until reaching the basins. Those arrangements are shown in figure 6. \nFrom the collection basin water was flowed into the channels, whose had a rectangular cross section \nshape, covered with a masonry vault or slabs of stone positioned in horizontal or roof shape (Corsetti, \n1937, Ashby, 1991, Aicher, 1995, Hodge, 2002). \nThe interior of the channel was lined with hydraulic cement to make it smooth and waterproof. \nFrom the spring down to the city the channel crossed the suburban areas in an open channel flow, \ntherefore allowing air to be present at all times over the water surface. \nThe channel was built with almost constant slope of its bottom, varying in its length only in a restricted \nrange (Lanciani, 1967, Lugli, 1970, Reina, 1917); Vitruvius gives a theoretical value inside the interval \n0.0025 and 0.005 m\/m. \nTo maintain the constant slope the \u201crivus\u201d curved around hills and \nvalleys, more than crossing them in a straight line, just as a river; \nhowever, when this was not possible, tunnels were excavated and the \nbottom of the valleys was crossed with siphons (Hodge, 2002)made \nwith pressure lead or stone pipes. \n \nThe characteristics of the siphons are described in figure 7.  \nThe bottom part was horizontal to avoid more acceleration and abrupt \nchanges in direction, while stone blocks secured the pressure pipes \nalong the sides of the valley. \nTwo tanks at the inlet and at the outlet of the pressure pipes were \nbuilt to keep the disconnection with the open channel aqueduct. \nThis was necessary to allow water to go back at almost the same \neight after passing the valley, that wouldn\u2019t be possible with the open \nchannel arrangements. \n \nFigure 6.

When the height became considerable, thick walls were substituted with the \nuse of a succession of arches which could lay in different orders, such as for bridges. \nMany sizes and material can be appreciated when visiting the ruin of those arches around the world, \ndepending on the local materials available and customs. Some examples are shown in figure 8. \nFigure 7. Channel crossing a valley:  scheme of a siphon arrangement (Hodge, 2002) \n \nFigure 8.

Cit., 19). The shape of the tank \nvaried (Cagnat, 1916, Pace, 1983) from the simple enlargement of the channel, to the more complex \nmulti-storey arrangement of piscina of Aqua Virgo (figure 9). \nFigure 9. Piscinae Limariae of Aqua Alessandrina, left and Aqua Virgo, right  \n(Adapted from Piranesi and Cagnat) \nOnce approached the city the channel was flowing to a partitioning tank, the \u201cCastellum Divisorium\u201d \n(Perkins,1994), were it was subdivided in different supply pipes going in separate parts of the city. This \nsecond part of the system, the urban distribution, was a pressure pipe distribution, into lead, terracotta or \nwood pipes, depending on the abundance of the materials in the different regions of the empire (Hodge, \n2002). \nThe description of the principle governing the operation of the castellum divisorium is given by \nVitruvius (Op.Cit, Book 8, chapter 6, par. 1\u20132).) The best preserved examples are Nimes and Pompei \nCastella (Richardson, 1989). \nFigure 10 reports the plan, picture of the fa\u00e7ade and picture of the inside of the building placed in the \nhighest point of the city, near Porta del Vesuvio. \nFigure 10. Castellum Divisorium in Pompeii:  Plan, S-E Facade, \nView of the interior catwalks and partitioning masonry walls. \n \nThe pressure pipe served other reservoirs throughout the city, when the city was much extended in \ndimensions (Rome). These \u201cCastella\u201d had, on the contrary of the castellum divisorium, mainly a storage \nfunction, to overcome the fluctuations in the daily consumption. \nOther examples of reservoir in the city with a exterior water display functions are the Nimphei and \nNaumachie (Cagnat, 1916). \nThey were huge reservoirs, with an ornamental facade decorated with niches, statues and columns, \nthrough which water was allowed to flow covering multiple cascades and collecting in a large basin at \nthe bottom of them. \n \n \nPlan of Side Ninpheum (Asia Minor) and the view of the ruins of a similar construction in Taormina, \nItaly, are given in figure 11. \n \nMonteleone M.C., Yeung H. and Smith R. (2007). A review of ancient Roman water supply exploring techniques of pressure reduction. \nWater Science & Technology: Water Supply, 7, (1), 113\u2013120. \nFigure 11. Side Ninpheum plan (Asia Minor) \u2013 from Lanckoronsky-   \nand Taormina Naumachia (Sicily, Italy) \n \nFrom the castella the water run into high pressure pipes to secondary \u201cCastella Privati\u201d, small water \ntowers, serving a limited number of users public and private (Hodge, 2002)  (figure 5). \n \nPOMPEII URBAN WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM \n \nA clear vision of the urban water supply system by means of water towers is given by Pompeii ruins. \nThe castellum divisorium was connected with three mains to the water towers standing along sides of \nroads throughout the city. \nThe outline of the distribution of public fountains, water towers and deep wells is given in figure 13. \nThe water towers were made of brick masonry 6 metres tall pillars, sustaining a lead tank on their top. \nThe single users paid to derive some amount of water for their own uses (domus, taberna), but even \npublic fountains were fed by these towers and were often placed beside them. \nThe means of metering the water in concession to the users were the calices, bronze orifices (Pace, \n1983) connecting the tanks to the single pipes serving each customer. In Pompeii case study they were \nplaced at the bottom of the lead tanks, with pipes running into cavities left in the brick pillars. Minimum \nsize of pipe connected was the quinaria pipe, about 2.31 cm in diameter. \nTherefore the lead small tank of the water towers acted ad a disconnection between the system at higher \npressure, the mains in the road, and the local low pressure system of the final users. \nFigure 12. Pompei Urban Water Distribution System (Adapted from Richardson, 1989) \nFountain \nWater Tower \nDeep Well \nCastellum Divisorium\nMonteleone M.C., Yeung H. and Smith R. (2007). A review of ancient Roman water supply exploring techniques of pressure reduction. \nWater Science & Technology: Water Supply, 7, (1), 113\u2013120. \nFor no reasons other than prosecutable behaviour of officers or users water had to be extracted directly \nfrom the major diameter pipes. \nThe only connection available was through these purpose built water towers or castella private, after \ncontacting and arranging the consumption quantities with the water office personnel (Frontinus, Op.Cit., \npar. 105 -106). \n \nLooking at this system of water supply to the final point of use it is clear that the pressure built up in the \nmains descending from the castellum at the top point of the city was dramatically broken down and \nregularised in the water towers tanks ,so that a level of water of about 7 meters, without accounting for \nall the pressure losses in the delivering customer pipes, was maintained over the final point of discharge \n(figure 14). \nFigure 13. Scheme of Pompei private water supply from water towers \n \nThis method was reckoned to reduce the pressure in the mains, because, although it has recently been \ndemonstrated that Roman lead pipes could bear more hydraulic pressure than they were used for,  \nRomans were preventing failures of pipes especially due to leakages in the pipes longitudinal joint and \nin the various fittings. \n \nA ROMAN WAY TO REDUCE PRESSURE IN WATER SUPPLY MAINS \n \nThis Roman urban water supply system gives some hints on a possible method to reduce internal \npressure in water supply mains in newly built housing arrangements. \nThe mains leading to single apartments could depart from a common local tank situated in an accessible \nlocation, so that pipes with larger diameters and higher pressure running into streets could be left \nuntouched. \nThis could give easy life for repairs, and most of all could create a disconnection between the high \npressure network and the users low pressure network. Therefore the number of junctions to the high \npressure loops in the streets, instead of being one per user, could be reduced to one per group of users. \nProvision could be made for a tank using reclaimed water for non potable uses, given that in the next \nfuture water can become precious even in countries with a \u201cwet\u201d climate, and that purifications systems \nsuch as membrane filtration allow nowadays a more economic use. \n \nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS \n \nComparing the application of the low pressure distribution system to our urban realities, it can be \nnoticed that modern buildings are in many cases higher than the ancient two stories houses, however \npumps can be available for all sort of conditions allowing many combinations. \nHouse supplyFountain \nSupply from the \nCastellum \nCalix \nIntake \nOverflow \nHouse \/ Shop \/ Fountain \n(Domus\/ Taberna\/ Munera) \nWater Tower \n(Castellum Plumbeum) \n1  m \n6  m \nMonteleone M.C., Yeung H. and Smith R.
