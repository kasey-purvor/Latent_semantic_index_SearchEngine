Critically ill patients who require management in an Intensive Care Unit are particularly\nsusceptible to these infections which are associated with a very high mortality. Selective decontamination of the\ndigestive tract (SDD) may reduce these infections and improve mortality but it has not been widely adopted into\npractice. We aim to 1. Clarify reasons why clinicians have avoided implementing SDD into clinical practice despite\nthe current best-evidence 2. Describe barriers to SDD implementation and 3. Identify what further evidence is\nrequired before full scale clinical implementation would be considered appropriate and feasible.\nMethods-: We have developed an international \u2018multi-lens\u2019 approach to investigate SDD from several perspectives.\nIn case studies we will identify accounts of implementation of SDD in practice, in terms of the behaviours\nperformed by the full range of individual clinicians, accounts of how SDD was first introduced into the Unit and\nspecific content that may be used to populate the content of behaviour change techniques to be used in an\nimplementation intervention and procedures to consider in order to deliver an implementation trial. In a 4 round\nDelphi study we will identify the range of stakeholders\u2019 beliefs, views and perceived barriers relating to the use of\nSDD. We will generate hypotheses about key beliefs about SDD and will inform the feasibility of any future\nrandomised controlled trial. In large-scale nationwide postal questionnaire surveys of the state of current practice\nwe will identify the factors predicting acceptability of an effectiveness or implementation trial using, and informed\nby, the theoretical domains structure. In semi-structured interviews with active international clinical trialists we will\nassess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial and identify challenges and barriers to undertaking research in\nthe field of SDD research.\nDiscussion: We believe these methods will allow us to determine whether clinical implementation trials or further\nlarge effectiveness trials are required before full scale implementation into clinical practice.\nBackground\nEach year in the UK 140,000 patients are admitted to an\nintensive care unit (ICU) and of these almost 60,000 will\ndie within a year of admission. Hospital acquired infec-\ntions (HAI) are a major clinical problem for modern\nhealth services as they are associated with morbidity and\nmortality as well as high additional health care costs. Cri-\ntically ill patients are extremely susceptible to HAI and\nthese are associated with a high additional mortality,\nprolonged hospital stays and a large health care resource\nutilisation. Between 20 and 50% of ICU patients suffer\nfrom such infections and major efforts are being underta-\nken to improve these outcomes [1,2].\nAn intervention that has gained much interest in redu-\ncing HAI is selective decontamination of the digestive\ntract (SDD). SDD involves the application of topical non-\nabsorbable antibiotics to the oropharynx and stomach\nand a short course of intravenous antibiotics [3-14]. The\nevidence base relating to SDD is reasonably strong with\n12 meta-analyses of 28 randomised controlled studies in\nthe literature [3-14]. Ten of these studies demonstrate a\nbenefit in terms of reducing pneumonia rates and six\n* Correspondence: brian.cuthbertson@sunnybrook.ca\n1Department of Critical Care Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,\n2075 Bayview Av, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nCuthbertson et al.

A very recent large\ncluster randomised study from the Netherlands demon-\nstrated a 3.5% reduction in adjusted mortality associated\nwith SDD [14]. Problems with these meta-analyses\ninclude clinical heterogeneity, lack of blinding and lack of\ndata on compliance with intervention. The Cochrane\nreview of SDD demonstrated an association with reduc-\ntion in pneumonia, OR 0.32 (0.26-0.38) and death OR\n0.75 (0.65-0.87) [3]. None of the published meta-analyses\nincluded the recent cluster randomised study [14]. This\nmortality benefit was present in the more recent rando-\nmised studies and is of the magnitude of 3-6% absolute\nrisk reduction (ARR) with a number needed to treat\n(NNT) of approximately 17 to save one life [3,14]. If this\nmortality benefit could be realised in UK practice then it\ncould save as many as 2-3000 lives per annum. However,\nthese findings require to be confirmed in other health\ncare environments.\nDespite this evidence base, ICU practitioners have not\nwidely adopted this intervention with only 10-15 ICUs\n(out of 240) reporting that they undertake SDD in the\nUK [14,15]. Existing surveys of practice have been\nunable to fully elucidate the reasons for this lack of\nadoption and implementation [14,15]. Reasons may\ninclude fears over encouraging antibiotic resistance, a\nlack of biological plausibility for the findings and a lack\nof external validity of the evidence base since most of\nthe existing studies come from countries where infec-\ntions due to multi-resistant organisms are uncommon\n[14]. Finally, it is possible that this intervention is so\ncounterintuitive that clinicians will not change their\npractice regardless of the evidence base or that one clin-\nician group could impede another group, who are in\nfavour of the intervention, from implementing it.\nIt seems that until there is high quality evidence\ndemonstrating clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness\nand the ecological impact of SDD in a range of health\ncare systems, this intervention is unlikely to be imple-\nmented and thus patients will be denied a potentially\nlife saving therapy. However, despite the clear impor-\ntance of HAI in critically ill patients, and despite a\nmulti-national appreciation and prioritisation of the\nimportance and urgency of this research topic, it\nremains unclear why this intervention has not been\nimplemented. Little is known about clinicians\u2019 beliefs\nabout the existing evidence base, the perceived benefits\nand risks of SDD in clinical practice, the factors that\ninfluence current practice and likely barriers to imple-\nmentation. Further, it is also unclear whether there is a\nrequirement for further high level evidence of effective-\nness before implementation would become acceptable\nand what sort of study would be feasible and acceptable\nto clinicians and trialists. This multi-method study will\naddress these issues in three regions (the UK, Canada\nand Australia\/New Zealand).\nAims\nThe overall aim of this study is to identify the perceived\nrisks, benefits and barriers to the use of SDD in critical\ncare units. To achieve this aim, the following objectives\nare proposed (with formal research questions (RQs)\nlisted):\n1. To identify and precisely describe the clinical inter-\nvention in units and hospitals that deliver SDD:\n\u2022 RQ1: What are the components of the intervention\nof SDD?\n\u2022 RQ2: How has SDD been implemented and deliv-\nered into practice?\n2. To identify the range of beliefs, interpretation and\nviews about the current evidence base relating to the\nuse of SDD in key stakeholder groups:\n\u2022 RQ3: What are the views of key stakeholders about\nthe likely positive and negative consequences of\nimplementing SDD in ICUs?\n\u2022 RQ4: What are the views of key stakeholders about\nthe likely barriers to implementing SDD in ICUs?\n\u2022 RQ5: What are the views of key stakeholders of\nthe internal\/external validity and adequacy of the\nexisting evidence base for SDD?\n3. To identify current practice and assess the accept-\nability of further randomised controlled trials in the\nfield of SDD in a wide group of intensive care clinicians\nand infectious disease clinicians\/medical microbiologists:\n\u2022 RQ6: What are the current practices and inten-\ntions of intensivists and infectious disease clinicians\/\nmedical microbiologists about SDD?\n\u2022 RQ7: If there are uncertainties in the evidence\nbase, do these clinicians believe they could be\naddressed in a clinical trial and what research ques-\ntions, trial design(s) and interventions would be opti-\nmal and what predicts these beliefs?\n4. To assess the feasibility of a proposed effectiveness\nrandomised controlled trial comparing SDD against a\ncontrol group in ICUs among international intensive\ncare clinical trialists:\n\u2022 RQ8: What are the likely challenges in undertaking\na large multi-national randomised controlled study\nof SDD in ICU?\nCuthbertson et al. Trials 2010, 11:117\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/117\nPage 2 of 7\nMethods\nThe study will use a \u2018multi-lens\u2019 approach to investigate\nSDD from several perspectives and in three national\nregions (the UK, Canada and Australia\/New Zealand) to\nallow greater understanding and international compari-\nsons of the issues that relate to the implementation of\nthis therapy. The investigation will involve four inter-\nrelated stages (Figure 1 shows a schema of this study).\nStage 1\nCase studies will be conducted in units in which SDD has\nbeen implemented (targeting RQs 1 and 2)\nThis stage will be conducted only in the UK region as\nthere are no adult critical care units in the other regions\nwho use SDD. The case studies will focus on a beha-\nvioural analysis of the processes of implementation,\nbased on a modification of Michie and Johnston\u2019s [16]\nadvice for specifying clinical behaviour (who, what, to\nwhom, when, how). It will identify the \u201cA,B,C\u201d (antece-\ndents, behaviour, consequences)[17] of each action that\nis taken in the sequence of behaviours between identify-\ning a patient who may be eligible for SDD, prescribing,\nsupplying, storing, communicating, administering (to the\npatient) and so on, and the factors associated with the\n\u2018flow\u2019 between these actions. This will involve\nobservational visits, interviews with a range of clinical\nstaff (e.g. consultants, registrars, pharmacists, nurses etc)\nand documentary analysis, which will be used to identify\nthe actions required from all staff to (a) introduce SDD\nto the ICU and (b) maintain, regulate and optimise the\ndelivery of SDD over time. These case studies will\ninform the practical issues around implementation of\nSDD in ICUs either in the context of a trial intervention\nor to inform implementation strategies. Two SDD units\nwill be purposively sampled from an existing database\nfrom a national survey of SDD in the UK [15]. One\nUnit that has recently implemented SDD and one that\nhas used SDD over a longer period will be identified.\nWhen identified, SDD Units will be contacted and asked\nto take part in the study. From multiple visits to each\nsite, structured observations of the administration of\nSDD in the ICU will be followed by semi-structured\ninterviews with nursing staff, clinical leads and other\ndecision makers to elicit accounts of the processes of\nchange, including decision making, documentation and\nresource issues. Retrospective accounts will be elicited,\ndescribing how the Unit decided to introduce SDD, fac-\ntors that triggered change, barriers experienced (i.e.,\ninterruptions to the \u2018flow\u2019 of actions), and the strategies\nused to overcome them. The perceived consequences of\nFigure 1 Design of study showing links to research questions.\nCuthbertson et al. Trials 2010, 11:117\nhttp:\/\/www.trialsjournal.com\/content\/11\/1\/117\nPage 3 of 7\nthe SDD policy for the unit (and the hospital more gen-\nerally) will be documented.\nThe case studies will identify accounts of implementa-\ntion of SDD in practice, in terms of the behaviours per-\nformed by the full range of individual clinicians;\naccounts of how SDD was first introduced into the\nUnit; specific content that may be used to populate the\ncontent of behaviour change techniques to be used in\nan implementation intervention and procedures to con-\nsider in order to deliver an implementation trial.\nStage 2\nA Delphi study to identify the range of stakeholders\u2019 beliefs,\nviews and perceived barriers relating to the use of SDD\n(targeting RQs 3, 4,5 and 7)\nThis stage will be conducted in all three regions. This\nphase of the investigation will generate hypotheses\nabout key beliefs about SDD and will inform the feasi-\nbility of any future randomised controlled trial. Using a\nDelphi technique comprising an initial exploratory\n\u2018round\u2019 so that the full range of views may be raised and\nthen considered by all participants in later rounds, fol-\nlowed by three iterations (i.e. four rounds in all), we will\nsequentially build a picture of respondents\u2019 beliefs and\nviews on SDD. We will further assess the likely factors\ninfluencing the acceptability of any future randomised\ncontrolled trial comparing SDD against a control group\n(not including SDD) in ICUs and\/or a proposed rando-\nmised controlled trial comparing implementation strate-\ngies for SDD against a control group in ICUs. Rounds 1\nto 3 will be conducted independently within each\nregion, whilst round 4 will be multi-region.\nThere is a broad range of estimates of suitable sizes for a\nDelphi panel, but smaller sizes (such as 10 per stakeholder\ngroup) have been deemed appropriate where panel mem-\nbers have similar training [18]. Four key stakeholder clini-\ncian groups (ICU physicians, ICU pharmacists, infectious\ndisease clinicians\/medical microbiologists, ICU clinical\nmanagers) will be sampled using existing databases from\nwithin each region. We will aim for 10 from each stake-\nholder group. The total sample size will thus be approxi-\nmately 40 in each of the three regions. Purposive diversity\nsampling will be used in all groups to identify as wide a\nrange of initial views as possible, based on a range of vari-\nables: Academic-affiliated or not; years of experience (time\nsince commencing as consultant\/other professional grade);\nsize of ICU (i.e. number of ICU beds); and current practice\n(routinely perform SDD or not). During the interview\nphase, diversity on these factors will be tracked using a\ndiversity sampling table and additional participants will be\ninvited to participate, if required, to maximise variation.\nTranscribed interviews will be content analysed based on\nthe theoretical domains framework using methods\npreviously employed by the research team in the context\nof critical care [19].\nThe Delphi study report will present (i) the perceived\nimportance of each specific belief about the use of SDD\nin ICUs; (ii) the acceptability and feasibility of conduct-\ning an effectiveness trial; and (iii) the acceptability and\nfeasibility of conducting an implementation trial. In\nround 4, the data from each regional setting will be pre-\nsented to all international participants by email. The\ninternational comparisons in this round are important,\nto increase the generalisability of the results and of any\nfuture study result, since lack of generalisability may\nhave been a major factor limiting the uptake and imple-\nmentation of SDD in the past. This round will require\nthat the investigations conducted in each country use a\nbroadly parallel time frame, so that the feedback is pre-\nsented to all participants with similar time intervals. The\nfull Delphi results will allow us to consider how best to\nelaborate the key findings from the nationwide survey of\nthe state of current practice, described below.\nStage 3\nNationwide surveys of the state of current practice to\nidentify the factors predicting acceptability of an\neffectiveness or implementation trial (targeting RQs 6 and 7)\nThis stage will be conducted in all three regions using\nlarge-scale postal questionnaire surveys using existing\ndatabases of intensivists and infectious disease clini-\ncians\/medical microbiologists in each region. This ques-\ntionnaire design will be informed by the theoretical\ndomains structure [17] but only the domains identified\nin the Delphi study as relevant to implementation of\nSDD will be included. Questionnaire items will be devel-\noped using standard theory-based methods with a\n7-point response format [20]. The exact content of the\nquestionnaire will be informed by the specific beliefs\nand views identified as important in the Delphi, thereby\nensuring maximum relevance. The draft questionnaire\n(and cover letter) will be pilot tested using one-to-one\ninterviews with 4 clinical collaborators to assess word-\ning, acceptability and length. An appropriate course of\naction will then be agreed (i.e. accept, change, eliminate\netc). Reminder letters (up to a maximum of two) will be\nposted to non-responders at two-week intervals after the\nfirst posting. Analysis will include simple descriptive and\nstatistical prediction techniques [21-24]. These surveys\nwill attempt to establish the current state of practice in\nICUs with regard to SDD, the nature of evidence still\nrequired and perceived barriers to implementation of\nSDD. In addition, they will identify the willingness of\nintensive care clinicians to participate in any future\neffectiveness trial of SDD in intensive care practice and\/\nor an implementation trial of strategies to increase\nCuthbertson et al.

The strongly predicting constructs and variables\nwill be targeted if this programme progresses to an\nimplementation trial, using systematic methods for\nintervention development [22].\nStage 4\nSemi-structured interviews with active clinical trialists in\nintensive care to assess the feasibility of a randomised\ncontrolled trial (targeting RQ 8)\nParticipants from all three regions as well as European\ninvestigators will take part in this stage. We will inter-\nview expert national and international clinical trialists in\nthe intensive care field including trialists with experience\nin SDD to identify challenges and barriers to undertak-\ning research in the field of SDD research. We will seek\nto recruit 10 participants from across the UK, Europe,\nCanada and Australia. Semi-structured one-to-one inter-\nviews using a topic guide developed from the previous\nphases as well as from expert experience will be used to\nstudy this area. Questions will address potential trial\ndesign issues (e.g. need for cluster randomisation), speci-\nfication of the SDD intervention and of control group\ncare; outcome measurement; recruitment; ethical con-\nsiderations and other issues raised in the observational\nand Delphi studies. Data will be transcribed and ana-\nlysed using content analysis [25]. A full description of\nthe design and measurement issues to consider when\nplanning a possible effectiveness trial will be produced.\nOutcome of project\nThis research will lead to an evidence-based decision\nabout whether to proceed to a clinical trial to evaluate\nan SDD intervention or an implementation trial (i.e.,\ndevelopment and evaluation of an intervention to\nincrease uptake of SDD in ICUs). The applicant team\/\nproject steering group will make an assessment of\nwhether a trial is necessary, justifiable, acceptable and\nfeasible based on possible patterns of results from the\nnational surveys, for example:\n1. If intention to implement SDD is low or variable,\nand predicted by attitude scores and\/or scores for speci-\nfic beliefs about the consequences (benefits and harms)\nof implementing SDD, it will be judged appropriate to\nproceed to trial.\n2. If intention to implement SDD is low or variable\nand predicted by scores relating to social influence (e.g.\npressure from colleagues in other disciplines), this\nwould suggest that an implementation intervention\ncould be effective if delivered by an identified opinion\nleader, clinical lead or local \u2018champion\u2019 through team\nmeetings. We would proceed to an implementation trial\nto evaluate such an intervention.\n3. If intention to implement SDD is low or variable\nand predicted by beliefs relating to lack of capacity to\nimplement SDD (e.g. resource issues), this would sug-\ngest that an implementation intervention could be effec-\ntive if it focuses on barrier identification and generation\nof strategies to overcome barriers, known as \u2018coping\nplanning\u2019 [26], we would proceed to an implementation\ntrial to evaluate such an intervention.\n4. If intention to implement SDD is low or variable\nand predicted (in the multi-level model) at the Unit\nlevel, rather than by individual clinicians\u2019 views of the\nevidence, we would design an intervention directed at\nICUs rather than individual clinicians. This would be\ninformed by the behavioural analysis of SDD implemen-\ntation in ICUs where it is currently practised. We would\nproceed to an implementation trial to evaluate such an\nintervention.\n5. By contrast, if intention to implement SDD is high\n(i.e., if there are ceiling effects and restricted variance),\nthen the current low level of implementation will be\nattributable to an \u2018intention-behaviour gap\u2019, suggesting\nthat external barriers prevent clinicians from translating\ntheir intentions into action. This pattern of results\nwould suggest that an implementation trial to test stra-\ntegies for facilitating uptake would be appropriate.\nFindings about acceptability and feasibility of a clinical\ntrial would also inform the decision about how best to\nproceed. Specifically:\n1. If willingness (intention) to participate in a trial is\nlow we will not proceed to a clinical trial.\n2. If willingness (intention) to participate in a trial is\nhigh this will indicate that the trial is sufficiently accep-\ntable to proceed. We will also take into account scores\nfor perceived ease or difficulty of participating.\nWe will also use the consensus data from the Delphi\nstudy and the investigation of two ICUs where SDD has\nbeen implemented, to decide: (i) behavioural (practical,\norganisational and management) issues that would need\nto be addressed in order to mount a trial; (ii) ethical\nissues relating to informed acceptance of trial entry\namong eligible patients; (iii) trial design issues including\nmeasurement of outcome and process variables. If any\none stakeholder group seems to be uniformly of the opi-\nnion that there are no design features that would make\na trial acceptable, and\/or if a third (or more) of the\nmembers of two (or more) groups deem any such trial\nunacceptable, the clinical trial should not be pursued\nfurther. Depending on the views expressed about the\nexisting evidence base (i.e. if treatment is viewed as\npotentially beneficial) we will consider the place of an\nimplementation trial to change clinical practice. If\nappropriate, the change techniques that would form the\ncomponents of such a trial will be selected using meth-\nods previously reported by members of the research\nteam [27,28]. The final decision on trial continuation\nwill be made by the study steering committee.\nCuthbertson et al.

The intervention SDD has the promise to improve\nthese outcomes and is not widely used. This rigorous\nmulti-national study intends to identify the perceived\nrisks, benefits and barriers to the use of SDD in critical\ncare units. This research could lead to a variety of\nfurther interventions including a multi-centre effective-\nness RCT or implementation study.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge the contribution to the writing of the protocol and the paper\nby the members of the SuDDICU group who are named in appendix 1.
