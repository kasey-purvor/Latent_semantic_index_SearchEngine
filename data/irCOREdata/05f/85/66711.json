'\nAdorno\nAesthetic Theory\nWhat does Adorno mean by 'authenticity'? The concept undoubt-\nedly occupies an important place in his aesthetics and pervades his\nthinking to a remarkable degree, even when the term itself is absent.\nBut as is the case with much of his conceptual framework, his no-\ntion of authenticity is never directly defined or addressed, and its\nmeaning has to be inferred from its relation to other concepts. This\napparent fuzziness makes it prone to dismissal as mere rhetoric and\nlays it open to the accusation that it serves no other purpose than\nto conceal summative and unsubstantiated value judgments on art-\nworks under a cloak of unattributed authority.' It can appear to lack\na clear identity. Its dependency on its relation to clusters of other\nconcepts becomes obvious enough when one considers claims like\nthe following in Asthetische Tbeorie 11970): 'The seal of authentic\nartworks is that what they appear to be appears as if it could not be\nprevaricated, even though discursive judgment is unable to define it'\nIAT, 199 I. This does not mean that the concept of authenticity lacks\na strong focus in Adorno's aesthetics, however, and I suggest that\nit is precisely through the exploration of its 'force field' of related\nconcepts - what Adorno calls, borrOWing a favourite term of Walter\nBenjamin's, its constellation - that light can be shed on this complex\nand value-loaded term.\nIn his well-known discussion of the music of Schoenberg and\nStravinsky in Pbilosophie del neuen Musil< (1949) Adorno identifies\n198\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 199\nthe accepted notion of authenticity as 'being-so-and-not-being-able-\nto-be- otherwise'.3 However, it is clear that he is not using the con-\ncept in any of its more familiar senses when he maintains that, after\nAuschwitz, the authentic works are the failures and that 'the authen-\ntic artists of the present are those in whose works there shudders\nthe aftershock of the most extreme terror.4 Revealed here are the\npolarities we come to expect in Adorno: On the one hand, authen-\nticity concerns the way a work appears to be what it is because it\ncan be no other way, an idea which contains a range of related con-\ncepts, including those of self-contained structural consistency and\nof totality; on the other hand, pitted against this is the idea that\nthe authentic modernist work is characterized by failure in these\nterms and that the social and the historical impinge on the appar-\nently autonomous world of the work of art, fracturing its integrity\nand making its consistency look suspect and ideological in the face\nof the horrors of the real world which culminate in Auschwitz. Au-\nthenticity for Adorno is therefore also associated with a modernist,\nfractured relationship between the individual and the social, the in-\nternal structure of the artwork and the external conditions within\nwhich it functions, a relationship which imputes a high degree of\nself-consciousness and self-reflexiVity to the work of art at a struc-\ntural, technical level. At the same time, it is also necessarily posited\non a concept of inauthenticity, that is, on the notion that there are\nworks which do not internalize this fractured relationship, which\nare not self-reflexive, and which remain content to comply with the\ntraditional stereotypes - what Adorno calls 'resigned art'. What is\ndecisive for Adorno is the relationship of art to the 'crisis of mean-\ning'. Authentic art rejects handed-down meaning through negation,\nto the effect that it appears to elevate meaninglessness itself in place\nof meaning, thereby becoming meaningful in spite of itself; resigned\nart affirms accepted meaning as if it were unproblematic, becoming\nitself the embodiment of reified consciousness. Adorno formulates\nthis division in Asthetische Tbeorie in terms that can serve as a point\nof reference for the ensuing discussion:\nThe dividing line between authentic art that takes on itself the crisis of\nmeaning and a resigned art consisting literally and figuratively of proto-\ncol sentences is that in significant works the negation of meaning itself\ntakes shape as a negative, whereas in the others the negation of meaning is\n200 MAX PADDISON\nstubbornly and positively replicated. Everything depends on this: whether\nmeaning inheres in the negation of meaning in the artwork or if the negation\nconforms to the status quo; whether the crisis of meaning is reflected in the\nworks or whether it remains immediate and therefore alien to the subject.\nIAT, ) 541\nWhile the concept of authenticity has a broad application within his\naesthetics and his philosophy in general, it has a special focus for\nAdorno in relation to music. It is this focus I shall examine here.\nThe concept is complex because, if one may risk such a metaphor,\nit is multidimensional. Keeping its different and opposing aspects in\nview at anyone time is difficult, as one is compelled always to view\nthe whole from a particular perspective, like walking around a large\nthree-dimensional object where the experience of the totality is al-\nways partial and restricted and where a conception of the whole can\nonly be pieced together later. Furthermore, there is also a historical\ndimension to the concept which demands attention, because here is\nto be seen the dynamic impulse of the concept of authenticity and\nits relation to Adorno's theoty of the historical dialectic of musical\nmaterial. What I am attempting to describe here is, of course, noth-\ning more than the Hegelian underpinning to all Adorno's thinking -\nhow to deal with contradiction in a manner which does not simply\nreduce it to a static formula but which also avoids losing a sense of\nthe dynamic totality of Adorno's thought. To attempt to reveal this\nunderlying dynamic structure of Adorno's thinking on authenticity,\nI first address the more familiar understandings of the term 'authen-\nticity' in music through considering his critique of the historical per-\nformance and early music movement, then go on to what I see as the\nmain topics of this essay: the concept of technical consistency as one\ncornerstone of Adorno's dialectical notion of authenticity; the ideo-\nlogical aspect of authenticity and consistency as false consciousness;\nand, finally, authenticity as self-refJexion, critique, and ultimately\nfailure.'\n1. AUTHENTICITY, HISTORICISM, AND ONTOLOGY\nThe term 'authenticity' has been hijacked in music by the historical\nperformance movement in a manner that has all but obliterated any\nother understanding of it within musicology. While the focus of this\nAuthenticity and Failute in Adorno's Aesthetics 201\nessay is not on eady music, there is nevertheless a need to reforge the\nlink present in Adorno's thinking between the positivistic notion of\nauthenticity associated with the historical performance movement\nand the ontological concept of authenticity IEigentlichkeitj associ-\nated in the first place with Heideggerian phenomenology.\nIn its most straightforward and everyday sense, the term 'authen-\nticity' refers to 'the real thing', the original, the unique, as opposed to\nthe illusory, the imitation, the reproduction, the fake, the counter-\nfeit, or the mass produced. It is also associated with the authority\nthat comes from the real as opposed to the illusory or fake. These\neveryday meanings are also part of Adorno's use of the term Autben-\ntizitiit but are given a turn toward conceptions of 'truth' and 'untruth'\nWhich are critical in orientation. In everyday terms, 'truth' can, of\ncoutse, be taken reasonably simply as 'true to' something outside it-\nself, loosely along the lines of correspondence theories of truth. This\nraises the question: true to what? One version is 'true to self', in the\nsense of inner expression of 'true identity', as implied in the aesthet-\nics of expression. Another is 'true to roots', or 'true to origins', in the\nsense of 'This Delta blues player is authentic'. lf understood in the\nputely positivistic sense of 'This painting is authentic, it is a genuine\nChagall, it's not a fake', it boils down to a version of 'true to itself'\nas that unique material object that can be authenticated by subject-\ning it to scientific tests to prove that it is what it purports to be.\nMore contentiously, the historical performance movement claimed,\nat least in its most fanatical years, that 'early music', to be authentic,\nmust be perfolmed on the original instruments with original tunings\nand performance conventions and using historically-researched pel-\nforming editions to produce the sound as it would have been heard\nat the time of its composition - in brief, according to the composer's\nintentions. The contradictions arising from this position in relation\nto historical performance have been pretty thoroughly debated over\nthe last half of the twentieth century and are now sufficiently well\nknown not to require rehearsing here. The critiques of the move-\nment have been particularly well represented in Richard Taruskin,\nLautence Dreyfus, Joseph Kerman, and Peter Kivy\u00b7\nAdorno's 1951 essay 'Bach gegen seine Liebhaber verteidigt' ('Bach\nDefended against his Devotees') represents one of the earliest and\nmost influential of the critiques of the historicizing tendency in the\nperformance of early music. In it he argues that the positivism which\n202 MAX PADDISON\ncharacterizes the historical performance movement land lays claim\nto an objectivity of method reminiscent of the natural sciences) is\ncombined with adherence to an ontology which gives to the object\nan aura of 'pure Being' ISeml and has much in common with the\nphenomenology of Husserl, Heidegger, and Jaspers. This means that\nthe notion of authenticity promoted by the early music movement\n(Adorno uses the aftermath of the bicentenary of Bach's death as\nthe obvious occasion for his essay) has two aspects to it. The first,\nand perhaps most obvious, is the focus on authentic performance at\nthe expense of the work itself. Adorno's critique of this tendency is\npolemical:\nHistoricism has excited a fanatical interest that no longer concerns even\nthe work itself. At times one can hardly avoid the suspicion that the sale\nconcern of today's Bach devotees is to see that no inauthentic dynamics,\nmodifications of tempo, oversize choirs and orchestras creep in; they seem\nto wait with potential fury lest any more humane impulse become audible\nin the rendition.7\nAdorno is not seeking to defend the performance excesses of the\nRomantic rediscovery of Bach in the mid-nineteenth century and its\nconsequences in the first half of the twentieth century (although he\nclearly has some sympathy for Schoenberg's remarkably opulent and\n'inauthentic' orchestral arrangements of the master). His criticism\nis directed at what he sees as the spurious claim to objectivity and\nthe identification of this with the original performance of the work\nat the time:\nWhat calls for refutation ... is that of which the purists are most proud -\ntheir 'objectiviry'. The only objective representation of music is one which\nshows itself to be adequate to the essence of its object. This, however, is not\nto be identified - as Hindemith, too, took for granted - with the idea of the\nhistorically first rendition.!P, 1431\nHe argues that the composer's view of his work cannot be taken as\nfinal and that it cannot be reconstructed. Furthermore - and this\nis very much part of Adorno's larger argument throughout his writ-\nings on music - he maintains that works cannot be identified with\nthe limitations of particular performances or indeed with the con-\nscious intentions of the composer. He writes, 'Authentic works un-\nfold their truth content, which transcends the scope of individual\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 203\nconsciousness, in a temporal dimension through the law of their\nform' IP, 143)\u00b7 Adorno shifts the emphasis, therefore, from histori-\ncal performance practice to the work itself and to what he calls its\n'law of form' - that is, he moves from a discussion of authenticity\nof performance practice to authenticity of the work as a form of cog-\nnition. I shall return to a discussion of Adorno's concept of form in\nlater sections. For the moment, however, it needs to be emphasized\nthat he is proposing the idea of the work, not as static Being [Seinl\noutside history, but instead as an historical unfolding, as a Becoming\n[Werden]. This crucial distinction brings us on to the second aspect\nof Adorno's reading of the historicist approach to performance: the\nconcept of Being.\nAdorno argues in his Bach essay that, through an emphasis on its\nobjectivity, Bach's music is elevated by the historicists to an abstract\nprinciple which transcends the individual subjectivity and which\nserves to close off any possibility of understanding the participation\nof his music in his time. By this Adorno means that Bach was also,\nin spite of his Pietism, a man of the Enlightenment who, through his\nmusic, took part in the rationalizing impulses of the Age of Reason.\nThis contrasts with the historical performance movement's reduc-\ntion of Bach to the status of a provincial church composer-craftsman.\nAdorno - in the context of the fashion for Heidegger in the 1950S-\nsuggests that\nItJhe present function of his IBach's) music resembles the current vogue of\nontology, which promises to overcome the individualistic condition through\nthe postulation of an abstract principle which is superior to and independent\nof human existence and yet which is free of all unequivocally theological\ncontent. They enjoy the order of his music because it enables them to sub-\nordinate themselves.... Bach is degraded by impotent nostalgia to the very\nchurch composer against whose office his music rebelled and which he filled\nonly with great conflict. IP, 1351\nAccording to Adorno's reading, therefore, the historicists have sec-\nularized Bach, then promptly elevated him to the status of 'univer-\nsal Being' in a manner which bestows on him a theological author-\nity to which they then subordinate themselves. This process reifies\nBach and prevents the dynamic and progressive features of his mu-\nsic being understood. His music, reduced to st1ltic Being, represents\nthe security of a bolthole from a threatening modern world and is\n204 MAX PADDISON\ncorrespondingly mystified and becomes ideology in the sense of false\nconsciousness. It is interesting to compare this interpretation with\na section in Negative Dialektil< (1966) which formulates the contra-\ndictory characteristics of the Heideggerian concept of EigentliciIkeit,\nnormally also rendered in English as 'authenticity': 'IT]he authen-\nticity Heidegger misses will promptly recoil into positivity, into au-\nthenticity as a posture of consciousness - a posture whose emigration\nfrom the profane powerlessly imitates the theological habit of the old\ndoctrine of essence.'s Adorno's critique of German Existentialism is\nto be seen in his book Jargon der Eigentlichkeit (1964; Jargon of Au-\nthenticitYI as well as Negative Dialektil<. While the fundamentals\nof this debate go right back to Adorno's work on Kierkegaard and\nHusserl in the 1930s, it is particularly in his critique of Stravinsky\nin Philosopme der neuen Musil< that its relevance to music becomes\napparent and that the two 'objectivities' of neo-classicism and histor-\nical performancc can be seen to share a common ideology. This is not\nto say that Adorno regards Stravinsky as emulating Bach in any naIve\nway. In fact, the reverse is the case, as he portrays Stravinsky as the\nurbane and sophisticated manipulator of style, arguing that he 'suc-\ncumbed to the temptation of imagining that the responsible essence\nof music could be restored through stylistic procedures', and that\nhis intention was 'emphatically to reconstruct the authenticity of\nmusic - to impose upon it the character of outside confirmation,\nto fortify it with the power of being-so-and-not-being-able-to-be-\notherwise' (PM, 136). Schoenberg's music, in contrast, is interpreted\nby Adorno in Philosophie der neuen Musil< as, in a sense, provincial\nwhen compared to Stravinsky's urbaniry, but at the same time radi-\ncal in the manner in which it relates to the historically handed-down\nmusical materiaL Schoenberg, in this interpretation, renounces the\nexternal gestures of 'authenticity' (that is, the attempt to stamp mu-\nsical gestures with the authority of the past) and instead, through\nresponding to the immanent demands of the material, achieves an\n'authenticiry of structure' characterized by what Adorno terms, sig-\nnificantly, 'immanent consistency' limmanente Stimmigkeitl. As he\nputs it,\nIn so doing, this schoollSchoenberg and the Second Viennese SchoolJ endan-\ngers almost every one of its own structures, but at the same time it gains,\non the other hand, not only a more cohesive and instinctive artistic view,\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 205\nbut also a higher objectivity than that objectivism - an objectivity, namely,\nof immanent consistency - and, further, of the undisguised appropriateness\nto the historical situation. (PM, 214, translation amendedj\n2. AUTHENTICITY, AUTONOMY, AND CONSISTENCY\nThus Adorno identifies authenticity with the concept of consistency\nIStimmigkeit] in connection with the way a work of art is structured.\nA work is structurally consistent Istimmig] to the extent that its\nstructure is the full realization of its dominating idea (Gedanke, as\nSchoenberg uses the term I. Adorno argues that 'the more authentic\nworks of art are, the more closely do they follow the objective re-\nquirements of internal consistency'.9 The 'truth' of a work in this\nsense corresponds to the philosophical conception of truth discussed\nby Adorno in Negative Dialektik as 'identity theory': That is to say,\nthe idea of the work is identical to its structure, just as form is in-\nseparable from content. In effect, the notion of consistency belongs\nat one level to that category of truth theories characterized by the\ncoherence of a system consistent within itself rather than by cor-\nrespondence to something outside itself. However, as we shall see,\nAdorno also goes on to disrupt this self-contained notion of authen-\nticity as consistency to include a combination of both Ithat is, to\nincorporate also a version of the correspondence theory). 10\nThe concept of consistency goes back a long way in the develop-\nment of Adorno's thinking, and it played an important part in the\ndebates he had with the composer Ernst Kienek in the late 1920S\nand early 1930S on musical material. In brief, these debates con-\ncerned the nature of the composer's relation to musical material:\nKienek took the line that the composer was the sovereign creator\nwho selected the material as needed from among all available possi-\nbilities, whereas Adorno's position was that the composer's choice\nwas severely limited by the historical stage reached by the mate-\nrial and that not all possibilities were actually available. Indeed, he\ninsisted that the material itself made historical demands on the com-\nposer to which the composer had no choice but to respond. Adorno\nalso linked the concept of consistency to the idea of progress and\nprogressiveness in relation to musical material- that is to say, those\ncomposers who responded to the objective demands of the handed-\ndown material were progressive and, by implication, their music was\n206 MAX PADDISON\n'authentic' (at this period he employed the term echt). In an article\nfrom 1930 which grew out of this debate, 'Reaktion und Fortschritt'\n('Reaction and Progress'; Kienek wrote a companion article entitled\n'Progress and Reaction'l, Adorno argued that 'it is only in its imma-\nnent consistency that a work proves itself as progressive. In each\nwork the material registers concrete demands, and the movement\nwith which each new work manifests these is the sole obligatory\nshape IGestaltl of history for the audror. A work drat meets these de-\nmands completely is consistent Istimmig].\" I A furdrer issue debated\nby Adorno and Kienek is whedrer musical material is to be regarded\nas of natural or of historical\/cultural origin. Adorno argues that all\nthat is meaningful in musical material is historical and social in ori-\ngin and that indeed musical material is not 'nature' but is culturally\npreformed; thus, what the composer engages with when composing\nis sedimented history and society. He writes, 'Whatever nature might\nbe to start with, it receives the seal of authenticity IEchtheitl from\nhistory. History enters into the constellation of truth.'''\nAll this has to be understood within the context of the notion of\nthe fully autonomous work in Western art music, Carl Dahlhaus's\n'idea of absolute music','3 historically liberated from its functional\norigins. The work is 'true' to the extent that it is true to its struc-\nturing idea (that is, consistentIand to the extent that it is a response\nto the demands of the historically handed-down musical material.\nThis is what constitutes the work's authenticity at this level - its\ngenuineness, its truth to itself and to its material, given these terms\nof reference.\nThese are, of course, very different notions of authenticity and\ntruth from those which occupy analytic philosophers. There, the\nmain concerns are with audrenticity and performance practice; com-\nposers' intentions and expression; the distinctions to be made be-\ntween sincerity and authenticity; and the problem of originals, fakes,\nand copies. The concept of consistency receives scant attention. For\nthe Hegelian Adorno, however, it provides an obvious starting point\nfor a concept of truth, one which he sees as fundamental to any\nnotion of authenticity. The concept of consistency is derived from\nHegel's system of logic as put forward both in his Wissenschaft\ndel Logik (1812) and in Logik (part I of dre ED2yklopiidiel. Hegel\nwrites, 'The study of truth, or, as it is here explained to mean, con-\nsistency Ithat is, the agreement of an object with oUIconception of it],\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 207\nconstitutes the proper problem of logic'.'4 It is a deceptively\nsmall step for Adorno to understand this in musical terms, given\nthe longstanding conviction throughout the nineteenth cenrury in\nGerman aesthetics and writing on music- from Wackenroder and the\nSchlegels through to Hanslick and Nietzsche - that music was itself\na mode of cognition, a form of knowledge, albeit non-conceptual. At\nthe same time, nevertheless, there are obvious problems with em-\nploying a notion like consistency, dependent as it is in Hegel's system\non conceptualization, to account for a non-conceptual mode of expe-\nrience like autonomous instrumental music. What would constitute\n'truth' in such music and how would we recognize the 'authentic'\nwork which embodied this truth? Hegel's account of 'truth' in his\nWissenschaft der Logik makes the matter clear enough in relation\nto conceptual thought through emphasizing the inseparability of the\nact of thinking from truth: 'Truth is the agreement of thought with\nthe object, and in order to bring about this agreement - for it docs not\nexist on its own account - thinking is supposed to adapt and accom-\nmodate itself to the object.'\" How can music achieve this? Hegel\nhimself, like Kant, had no doubt that it could not, and he considered\nthat 'independent music' witbout a text risked becoming empty and\ndevoid of meaning because of its identity of form and content. In his\nVorJesungen iiber die Asthetik (1835; Aesthetics: Lectures on Fine\nArts), he writes,\nThe composer for his pan can of course put into his work a specific meaning,\na content consisting of ideas and feelings and their aniculated and complete\nsuccession, but, conversely, he can also not trouble himself with any such\ncontent and make the principal thing the purely musical strucrurc of his\nwork and the ingenuity of such architecrure. But in that case the musi-\ncal production may easily become something utterly devoid of thought and\nfeeling, something needing for its apprehension no previous profound culti-\nvation of mind or heart. '6\nHegel, like Kant, had little understanding of autonomous music -\nindeed, he happily acknowledged his limitations in this field -\nand never once mentioned anywhere in his writings the obvious\nparadigm case for such music: that of his exact contemporary,\nBeethoven. At the same time, both Hegel and Kant, through their im-\nmense joint influence on the thought of the nineteenth century, scrve\nas a catalyst - one could even say a provocation - for the development\n208 MAX PADDISON\nof an autonomous music which sees itself also as a form of cogni-\ntion on a par with philosophical speculation. A brief excursus into\nthe musical aesthetics of the nineteenth century will help provide\nthe essential historical dimension at this point. The question is this:\nHow does a mode of art like Western art music, regarded as a form\nof cognition without concepts and characterized by a condition of\nextreme autonomy, come to be the focus for a discussion of what it\nmeans to establish an authentic (that is, true) relation to the world?\nExcursus I: Art Music, Consistency, and the\nAutonomy Aesthetic\nI suggest that this question has two aspects which can be use-\nfully illuminated by juxtaposing certain ideas of Hanslick and\nNietzsche. On the one hand, Eduard Hanslick, in his carefully ar-\ngued Vorn Musikalisch-Schonen (1854; On the Musically Beautiful),\nsought to refute the dominant expression aesthetic and to justify a\nself-contained musical logic as meaningful and consistent in itself\nIthat is, without reference to anything outside itself and dispensing\nwith metaphysical explanations). Hanslick's argument has had an\nenormous influence, nor least on Adorno. His position, which, like\nAdorno's own, owes much to Hegel's logic but little to his thoughts\non music as put forward in his Vorlesungen tiber die Aesthetik, is\nclearly stated in Chapter 3 of Vom Musikalisch-Schonen:\nIn music the concept of IEoem' is materialized in a specifically musical way.\nThe forms which construct themselves OUI of tones are not empty but filled;\nthey are not mere contours of a vacuum, but a mind IGeistj giving shape to it-\nseU from within.... Music has sense and logic - but musical sense and logic.\nIt is a kind of language which we speak and understand yet cannot trans-\nlate. It is due to a kind of subconscious recognition that we speak musical\n'thoughts' and, as in the case of speech, the trained judgment easily distin-\nguishes between genuine thoughts and empty phrases. In the same way, we\nrecognize the rational coherence of a group of tones and call it a sentence\nISatz], exactly as with every logical proposition we have a sense of where it\ncomes to an end, although what we might mean by 'truth' in the two cases\nis not at all the same thing. 17\nHanslick's position offers the possibility of understanding the con-\ncept of consistency in relation to music through emphasizing the\nconcept of form as the shaping of musical material by the mind\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 209\nIGeistl. There is an emphasis on the 'rational coherence' of a work\nand on the idea of a purely immanent musical logic, all of which ties\nin well with the music theory and music pedagogy of the middle and\nsecond half of the nineteenth century. ,8\nOn the other hand, the problem of music's referentialiry remains\nan issue with formalism and is not satisfactorily dealt with simply by\narguing that musical works refer only to themselves in their unity of\nform and content and that they are meaningful because they are prod-\nucts of a mind shaping musical material. It can also be argued that\nthe vestiges of music's preautonomous referentiality still remain and\nhave themselves, with their extramusical origins, given shape and\nform to what Hanslick and his followers regarded as purely musical\nfigures and gestures. Indeed, Richard Wagner calculatedly used the\ncontrived conjunction of musical motif and extramusical gesture to\ndevelop the central structural feature of his music, the theory and\npractice of the leitmotif. Furthermore, this is clearly the origin of\nthe position put forward by Friedrich Nietzsche in Menschlicbes. Al-\nlzumenschlicbes (18781, where in aphorisms 215 and 216 he argues\nfor a recognition of the historical process through which musical\nfigurations, conventions, gestures acquire their apparently imma-\nnent musical meanings - that is, largely through former, but now\nnaturalized, associations with drama, poetry, dance, and physical\ngesture:\nI Absolute music' is either form in itself, at a printitive stage of music in\nwhich sounds made in tempo and at varying volume gave pleasure as such, or\nsymbolism of form speaking to the understanding without poetry after both\narts had been united over a long course of evolution and the musical form\nhad finally become entirely enmeshed in threads of feeling and concepts.\"\nAdorno, who was greatly influenced by Nietzsche (to such an extent\nthat he cited the whole of aphorism 215 in a lengthy foomote in\nPhilosopbie der neuen MusikJ:\u00b0 had acknowledged this tendency as\nan aspect of the language character of music. For him it also encom-\npassed the previous social function of music, now sublimated within\nthe autonomous work and manifesting only as residual gestures. In\nVersuch iiber Wagner (19521, he considers the gestural dimension of\nabsolute music:\nIt is no doubt true that all music has its roots in gesture and harbours it\nwithin itself. In the West, however, it has been spiritualized and interiorized\n210 MAX PADDISON\ninto expression, while at the same time the principle of construction subjects\nthe overall flow of the music to a process of logical synthesis; great music\nstrives for a balance of the two elements\"\nWhile this repressed heteronomy does not affect the capacity of the\nwork to achieve consistency of form, it is a factor which nevertheless\nconstantly threatens the self-enclosed autonomy of absolute music\nwith the danger of disintegrating into its heteronomous elements.\nAdorno has Wagner in mind here when he argues that the very strat-\negy which was designed to give the music dramas their large-scale\nsense of unity, coherence, and consistency - that is, the technique\nof the leitmotif - also threatens disintegration through too great an\nemphasis on the constant identity of the leitmotifs in spite of their\nconstant transformations.\nThus the consistency of the work is achieved through domination\nof material which itself has a tendency to revert to its heteronomous\norigins. This negation of origins is one aspect of the ideological char-\nacter of the technical consistency of the work. The other is that,\nas music achieved its historical autonomy through ever increasing\nrationalization of its material and its procedures toward total con-\nsistency, it also retreated from the outside world into its own inner,\nclosed world. The epitome of this process for Adorno is the music of\nBrahms.\n3\u00b7 AUTHENTICITY, INAUTHENTICITY, AND IDEOLOGY\nIn Philosophie der neuen Musik, Adorno expands on the extreme\nconsistency of Brahms's music, including its principle of economy,\nthe derivation of a multiplicity of ideas from a minimum of basic mo-\ntivic material, and the inheritance of these processes by Schoenberg\nand the Second Viennese School: 'There is no longer anything which\nis unthematic, nothing which cannot be understood as derived from\nthe identity lof the basic thematic material], no matter how latent'\n(PM, 57; translation amended). In Einleitung in die Musiksoziologie\n(1962), however, he offers an ideology critique of these same features\nin the following terms:\nThat Brahms -like the entire evolution since Schumann, even since Schu-\nbert - bears the mark of bourgeois society's individualistic phase is indis-\nputable enough to have become a platitude. In Beethoven the category of\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 2 II\ntotality still pteselVes a pictute of the right society; in Btahms it fades in-\ncteasingly into a self-sufficiently esthetic principle fot the otganization of\nprivate feelings. This is the academic side of Brahms. His music beats a\nmournful tetreat to the individual, but as the individual is falsely absolu-\ntized over society Brahms's wotk too is surely part of a false consciousness-\nof one from wh.ich no modem art can escape without sacrificing itseH.u-\nThus Adorno's notion of authenticity can be understood as incorpo-\nrating a further stage, a critique of self-enclosed consistency which\nopens it to that which lies beyond its autonomous sphere. Adorno\nwrites, 'The consistency of art works is the aspect that enables them\nto share in the truth, but it also implicates them in falsehood' IEMS,\n2421. The notion of authenticity as consistency is also inadequate-\nindeed, it is ideological. As we have seen, the term 'ideology' is here\nto be understood both in the Hegelian sense of illusion or semblance\nISchein) and in the Marxian sense of 'false consciousness' Ithat is,\nas referring to cultural forms which express the material relations of\nsociety in a way which embodies the interests of a dominant class\nwhile simultaneously concealing them). So at this level the consis-\ntency of the work and its integrated totality, its truth and authen-\nticity, put forward initially as universal principles, are seen as false,\nas illusory, as inautbentic. However, read in a certain way, even the\nideological moment of all art can also be seen as 'authentic', in that\nit acts as a critical commentary on the real material relations of so-\nciety, whether it wishes to or not. As Adorno puts it in Astbetiscbe\nTbeorie, 'A critical concept of society is inherent in all authentic art\nworks and incompatible with how society conceives of itself' IATIL],\n33 5)\u00b7 This is because, in Adorno's terms, music contains social rela-\ntions within its material and its structure, but unconsciously, so to\nspeak, while at the same time positing an ideal set of relationships,\n'instances of the relationship of pan to whole, which is utopian and\ntherefore acts as a criticism of the excluded real world. In this, I sug-\ngest, can be seen a juxtaposition rather than a combination of the\ncoherence and the correspondence theories of truth. Furthermore,\nthe autonomous musical work is ideological in another sense: Jrs\nautonomy is an illusion, given the commodity character of all an\ntoday as a result of the effects of the culture industry. Wagner is a\ngood example here, and Adorno's critique of Wagner's music also at-\ntempts to discuss the composer in relation to commodity fetishism\n212 MAX PADDISON\nand the Hollywood movie. Similarly there is the example of his much\nmaligned and misunderstood critique of popular music and mass cul-\nture. A second brief excursus is relevant at this point to discuss the\nemergence of notions of authenticity, autonomy, and consistency in\nrock music and the discourses around it since Adorno and to see\nthese in the context of an ideology critique.\nEXCUISUS 2: Rock Music and the Rise of Ideologies of\nAuthenticity and Consistency\nIn spite of appearances, there are also moments when Adorno con-\ncedes that popular music contains a utopian 'promise of happiness',\nhowever much a product of the culture industry. Indeed, it is clear\nthat a notion of authenticity underlies all value judgments in spite\nof current claims in cultural theory to have dispensed with the need\nfor it by dismissing it as part of the mythologizing of the rock auteur\nby rock criticism. This has become particularly noticeable in dis-\ncussions concerning rock music versus pop music, whether among\nrock academics, rock journalists, or rock fans. Not unexpectedly, the\nAdornian claim that authentic music resists commodification while\ninauthentic music embraces it plays a part here too and has become\nassimilated and internalized within the culture of rock music itself\nsince the 1960s (in the 1950S, rock 'n' roll showed no interest in\nissues of authenticity, stars, fans, and music press alike happy to ac-\ncept the music as entertainment I. As Michael Coyle and Jon Dolan\nhave observed,\nThe concern to distinguish authentic rock from industry pabulum developed\nfrom sources antithetical to all that rock 'n' roll represented to its early au-\ndiences. On the one hand, the notion of authenticity derived from fiercely\nintellectual objections to the very nature of consumer culture. In particular,\nthe attacks of German critical theorists Theodor Adorno and Walter Ben-\njamin provided a rhetoric whereby to imagine a preindustrial, precommer-\ncial pastoral: to imagine forms of artistic expression that were the genuine\nexpression of total forms of life. This rhetoric has been and remains broadly\ncompelling. 'I\nBut in one very important respect, Coyle and Dolan seriously mis-\nrepresent Adorno when they suggest that his notion of authenticity\ndepends on the image of 'a preindustrial, precommercial pastoral'. In\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 213\nfact, Adorno locates authenticity in the unflinching encounter with\nthe hagrnentation and contradictions of modernity - that is, with the\nindustrialized, rationalized urban world. Authenticity in rock music\nhas certainly attached itself to the idea of 'roots' and, in particular,\nof 'folk', especially, as Coyle and Dolan have pointed out, through\nthe intermediary of the college scene of the late 1950S and the early\nI 960s.In this respect, the so-called folk movement, with its legacy to\nrock music, has features in common with the search for 'rootedness'\nin tradition, folk, and community which characterized tendencies in\nthe art music of the early twentieth century and the version of con-\ntinuity and imposed consistency which went with them. I suggest\nthat Adorno's ideology critique of this version of authenticity applies\nas much to popular music as it does to the 'early music' movement\nand to neoclassicism and folklorism. Furthermore, in the light of no-\ntions of authenticity which appeared during the r960s, rock music\nhas developed its own understandings of progress and reaction, of\nmodernism and neoclassicism, of an avant-garde (dadaism, surreal-\nism) and anticommodity aesthetic, and of a relation to a tradition of\nexpectations and generic norms to be subverted. It is no exaggeration\nto suggest that rock music in this sense has risked retreating into its\nown form of autonomy as a consequence of growing older, coming\nof age, losing its exclusively youthful audience, and becoming one\nof a number of competing style-systems. It is in this context that\none dares talk of 'consi~tency' as well as authenticity in relation to\nrock music. In support of this contention, I draw on the central ar-\ngument put forward by Allan Moore in his book Rock: The Primary\nText: 'What does serve to separate rock hom other sorts of music\nis a degree of consistency which can be found within its musical\nrules and practices. This consistency can most clearly be discussed\nby invoking the concept of \"style.\"'\"\nSimon Frith, in addressing the problem of value in rock aesthetics,\nattempts to step round the issue of authenticity while in the process\npaying his respects to Adorno:\nRock music depends on myth - the myth of the youth community, the myth\nof the creative artist. The reality is that rock, like all twentieth-century pop\nmusics, is a commercial form, music produced as a commodity, for a profit,\ndistributed through mass media as mass culture. It is in practice very diffi-\ncult to say exactly who or what it is that rock expresses or who, from the\n214 MAX PADD1S0N\nlistener's point of view, are the authentically creative performers. The myth\nof authenticity is, indeed, one of rock's own ideological effects, an aspect of\nits sales process: rock stars can be marketed as artists, and their particular\nsounds marketed as a means of identity. Rock criticism is a means of le-\ngitimating tastes, justifying value judgments, but it does not really explain\nhow those judgments came to be made in tbe first place. 11 the music is not,\nin fact, made according to the 'authentic' story, then the question becomes\nhow we are able to judge some sounds as more authentic than others, what\nare we really listening for in making our judgments? ... The question of the\nvalue of pop music remains to be answered.';\nFrith attempts to answer this question by assuming that the notion\nof authenticity in popular music is founded on the myth of expres-\nsion - the expression of 'the \"real\" artist, emotion or belief lying\nbehind it,.,6 He suggests that 'the question we should be asking is\nnot what does popular music reveal about \"the people\" but how\ndoes it construct them.\"? But this gets us only halfway toward an\nanswer, because it uses a very limited concept of authenticity which\ndoes not recognize the extent to which the idea that music is exclu-\nsively about expression had already been seriously questioned in the\n1850S. Moreover, Frith always considers 'music' in the most general\nand generic terms, never asking more detailed questions about the\nway in which music itself is also constructed. This unwillingness,\nor perhaps inability, to make a thoroughgoing connection between\nthe constructedness of people and the constructedness of music is a\nweakness in his position, as it is also in other sociological approaches\nwhich ignore the fact that, whatever else it might be, a rock song is\nalso a musical structure. The relation to commodification is itself a\nmaterial one, inherent in the structure of the music, and not merely\na matter of lyrics or function as social cement.\nRock academics, including Frith, who take an exclusively socio-\nlogical perspective on popular music rightly criticize the tendency of\nmusicologists and, in panicular, music analysts to fetishize the mu-\nsical object itself at the expense of its role as pan of the context of\nidentity construction. Consistency, the focus of technical analysis, is\nideological, dependent as it is on a questionable autonomy aesthetic.\nAt the sarne time, it is also significant: The technical makeup of the\nmusical object, as well as its relation to other musical objects and to\ncurrently available musical material and technical means, is also an\nindicator of social relations mediated as musical-technical relations.\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 2 I 5\nTo ignore this is to place the music itself at the periphery as the\nmere occasion for the construction of identity rather than within\nthe nexus of social relations.\nI argue that Adorno's use of the term 'authenticity' focuses the\ntension between consistency as trutb and consistency as ideology,\nan antagonistic relationship of opposites to which there can be no\nresolution at the level of the musical object and which leaves its\ntraces as fractures in the structure of the work. The authentic work\nat this level manifests its truth content, to use Adorno's loaded term,\nas the objective problems of its form:\nIn works of art immanent consistency and meta-aesthetic truth go to make\nup truth content.... Art works pose the problem of how the truth of reality\ncan become the truth of art.... Society's discontinuities, its untruths and\nideologies, emerge in the work as structural discontinuities, as deficiencies.\nThis is so because the orientation of works of an, their 'stance towards\nobjectivity', remains a stance towards reality. (ATlLJ, 395-61\n4. AUTHENTICITY, SELF-REFLECTION, AND CRITIQUE\nAt this level of the authenticity of a work as the sublation of its\nimmanent structural consistency and of its ideological moment as\nthe excluded, repressed social other, there is the further important\nfeature already noted: The work functions also as a form of critique,\nas critical reflection. The question is, to what precisely does art ad-\ndress this critique? To society or to musical material? The answer\nis both. On the one hand, Adorno considers that 'authentic modern\nworks are criticisms of past ones', and indeed he suggests that 'aes-\nthetics becomes normative by articulating these criticisms' (AT[Lj,\n4921. But lest we mistake this as an argument for formalism pure and\nsimple, Adorno also argues that society appears in musical material\nimmanently. As he puts it in Astbetiscbe Tbeorie, 'The unresolved\nantagonisms of reality appear in art in the guise of immanent prob-\nlems of artistic form. This, and not the deliberate injection of ob-\njective moments or social content, defines art's relation to society'\n(ATILJ, 8). What this reading attempts to clarify is a complex prob-\nlem in Adorno's aesthetics: that the autonomous, individual work\nof art can be simultaneously ideologicalli.e., a manifestation of false\nconsciousness, illusion, self-deception) and authentic lin the sense of\n216 MAX PADDISON\nbeing a form of critical cognition, of critical reflection). Adorno for-\nmulates the problem thus: 'The fact that society\"appears\" in works\nof art both in an ideological and a critical manner is apt to lead to\nhistorico-philosophical mystification. Speculative thought is easily\nduped into thinking there is a pre-established harmony between so-\nciety and works of art, courtesy of world spirit. Their true relation is\ndifferent, however' (ATILJ, 3351. That is to say, their true relation is\nantagonistic, fragmented, and critical. The case of Mahler comes to\nmind here as an example of this problem and of Adorno's dialectical\ninterpretation of it.\nAutonomous artworks, according to Adorno, are like windowless\nmonads in the Leibnizian sense. They contain society but are blind to\ntheir social content. Social forces and relations of production 'crop up\nin art because artistic labour is social labour and because an artistic\nproduct is a social product' (ATIL], 335). The difference between art-\nworks and society lies in the way in which artworks turn away from\nsociety and operate with a different form of rationality even while\nbeing part of the dominant social forces and relations of production.\nAuthentic works, in Adorno's terms, use extreme rationalization to\ndominate the handed-down material yet do so in a way which allows\nthe repressed social content of the material to speak again, but now\nin purely musical terms within the closed world of the work. Such a\nnotion of authenticity, however, whereby a work attempts to achieve\nconsistency of form (which implies integration) through a critical re-\nlationship to the handed-down material (material which, since the\nperiod of the late Beethoven and Berlioz, has tended increasingly\ntoward fragmentation and disintegrationj, leads to failure, accord-\ning to Adorno - a kind of failure which is not simply the result of\ntechnical inadequacy on the part of the composer but rather comes\nfrom the impossibility of succeeding in the task to be faced, a task\nwhich must be undertaken nevertheless. This is what could be called\n'truth to the historical demands of the material', in Adorno's terms,\nand it is an aspect of what he calls the 'truth content' of a work. The\nhanded-down forms and schemata begin to lose their binding power.\nThe historical thrust toward integration within autonomous music\nin the Western art tradition is taken to extremes - versions of it at\ndifferent stages are to be seen in, for example, Beethoven, Wagner,\nBrahms, Schoenberg, and, of course, the multiple serialism of the\n1950S as its telos, which also sees its final collapse. In the process,\nAuthenticity and Failure in Adorno's Aesthetics 217\ntotal integration, indeed, autonomous music itself as a CUltUIal form\nwhich grew up with and came of age in the 'bourgeois period' &om\nthe eighteenth-century Enlightenment to the mid-twentieth century\nand the end of aesthetic modernism, becomes revealed and is seen\nas illusion. Adorno attempts to formulate this dilemma as follows:\nExtreme integration is iUusion pushed to the extreme. But there is a possi-\nbility 01 a reversal 01 the process: ever since the late Beethoven, those artists\nwho had gone larthest along the road to integration were able to mobilize\ndisintegration evemuelly. At this point in the career 01 an artist, the truth\ncontent 01 art whose vehicle was integration turns against art. It is pre-\ncisely at these turning points that an has had some 01 its greatest moments.\n(ATILJ, 67)\nIt is interesting to consider two examples of what Adorno means\nhere in relation to authenticity and failure. First, in Adorno's book\nMahler: Eine musil<alische Physiognomik (Mahler: A Musical Phys-\niognomy, 19601 we find the following remarkable passage: 'lIlt is\nonly in the moment of inauthenticity, which unmasks the lie of\nauthenticity, that Mahler has his truth.... Objectively Mahler's mu-\nsic knows, and expresses the knowledge, that unity is attained not\nin spite of disjunction, 'but only through it.,,8 Adorno argues that\nMahler's music reveals consistency as integration (which, as we have\nseen, is what can be regarded as constituting authenticity at the level\nof the autonomous work as an 'in-itself'1 to be an illusion - that is,\nas inauthenticity. And furthermore, through his structural, critical\nrelationship to 'inauthentic', commodified, second-hand materials,\nhe achieves a different level of authenticity.\nThe second example is &om Adorno's unfinished Beethoven book,\nBeethoven: Philosopme der Musil<, the &agments of which were first\npublished in German in 199J:\nAn works of the highest rank are distinguished from the others not through\ntheir success-for in what have they succeeded! - but through the manner of\ntheir failure. For the problems within them, both the immanent, aesthetic\nproblems and the social ones.... are so posed that the attempt to solve them\nmust fail, whereas the failure of lesser works is accidental, a mailer of mere\nsubjective incapacity. A work of art is great when it registers a failed attempt\nto reconcile objective antinomies. That is its truth and its 'success': to have\ncome up against its own limit. In these terms, any work of art which succeeds\nthrough not reaching this limit is a failure. '.\n218 MAX PADDISON\nAnd he continues: 'This theory states the formal law which detel-\nmines the transition from the \"classical\" to the late Beethoven, in\nsuch a way that the failure objectively implicated by the former\nis disclosed by the latter, raised to self-awareness, cleansed of the\nappearance of success and lifted, for just this reason, to the level\nof philosophical succeeding' (BPM, 1001. A more polished version\nof these fragments appears in the essay 'Verfremdetes Hauptwerk:\nZur Missa Solenmis' (1959; 'Alienated Masterpiece: the Missa\nSolenmis'):\nThe late Beethoven's demand for truth rejects the illusory appearance of\nthe unity of subjective and objective, a concept practically at one with the\nclassicist idea. A polarization results. Unity transcends into the fragmentary.\nIn the last quartets this takes place by means of the TOUgh, unmediated\njuxtaposition of callow aphoristic motifs and polyphonic complexes. The\ngap between both becomes obvious and makes the impossibility of aesthetic\nharmony into the aesthetic content of the work; makes failure in a highest\nsense the measure of success. In its way even the Missa sacrifices the idea\nof synthesis.3\u00b0\nWhat is ultimately significant for Adorno is the nature of the\nsubject-object relation within musical works. This is, of course, a\ndominant theme running through Philosophie del neuen Musil<. and\nis the decisive factor in Adorno's assessment of Schoenberg in rela-\ntion to Stravinsky in that book. Music, as a particular version of the\nexternalization and objectification of subjectivity, is seen as a sub-\nlimated, or repressed, relation to society in its interaction with its\nmaterial. The historical grounds for such an alienated relationship,\nwhere art ends up both as an unconscious recording of history and\nas an attempt to escape it through positing a utopian alternative,\nprovide the poles for Adorno's field of enquiry. In the fragmented\nwork, the work whose self-reflexivity is a result of 'coming of age',\nAdorno sees authenticity in the failed attempt to achieve coherence,\nintegration, and consistency in a fractured world.\nNOTES\nI.
