These\naircraft are designed such that the internal carriage\nof weapons is vital in maintaining a low radar cross-\nsection, which in turn increases the vehicle\u2019s surviv-\nability. However, when the weapons bay doors are\nopened for weapons release, flow over the exposed\ncavity can cause a number of undesirable effects.\nThese include self-sustaining acoustic oscillations\nand high-intensity tones that can lead to structural\nfatigue [1] (occurring, primarily, in cavities with a low\nratio of streamwise length, L, to cavity depth, H ) and\nadverse longitudinal pressure distributions leading to\nnose-in pitchingmoments on stores released from the\ncavity (primarily for high L\/H ) [2].\n\u2217Corresponding author: Cranfield University, Defence Academy of\nthe UK, Shrivenham, Swindon,Wiltshire SN6 8LA, UK.\nemail: k.knowles@cranfield.ac.uk\nAs suggested above, rectangular cavity flows can be\ndefined as one of two main types, primarily depen-\ndent on the length-to-depth ratio (L\/H ) of cavity [3]\n(see Fig. 1). \u2018Open\u2019 cavity flows (Fig. 1(a)) occur in\ncavities with L\/H < 7\u20139 (typically) and are character-\nized by strong pressure oscillations that lead to noise\nradiation (often in excess of 170dB), structural vibra-\ntion, and high levels of heat transfer at the trailing\nedge. \u2018Closed\u2019 cavity flows (Fig. 1(b)) occur in cavi-\nties with L\/H > 10\u201314 (typically) and are regarded as\nquasi-steady flows. The pressure distribution along\nthe floor of a \u2018closed\u2019 cavity shows a large longitu-\ndinal pressure gradient (Fig. 1(c)) that causes a large\nincrease in pressure drag and can lead to store separa-\ntion difficulties. Cavity geometries in the approximate\nrange 8 < L\/H < 11 are described as \u2018transitional\u2019 and\nhere the cavity flows exhibit a combination of \u2018open\u2019\nand \u2018closed\u2019 flow features (Fig. 1(c)). Note that Plen-\ntovich et al. [3] found that the precise boundaries\nbetween open, transitional, and closed flows (defined\nby the centre-line pressure distribution) depend on\nfreestream Mach number and cavity width-to-depth\nratio (W \/H ). Nevertheless, open flow always occurred\nfor L\/H < 7.\nFor \u2018open\u2019 cavity flows, the pressure oscillations that\nare observed were initially investigated by Rossiter [4].\nJAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009 Proc.

[2]\nRossiter proposed a feedback loop, whereby acoustic\nwaves would form at the downstream wall from vor-\ntices shed initially from the upstream cavity wall, with\nsynchronization occurring betweenpoints in the loop.\nThis resulted in the semi-empirical \u2018Rossiter equation\u2019,\nwhich can be used to predict the frequency for a given\nmode of oscillation in a given cavity geometry\nf = U\u221e\nL\n(m \u2212 \u03b1)\n(M\u221e + (1\/K )) (1)\nThis was subsequently modified [5] to account for\nthe higher speed of sound within the cavity, which\nis approximately equal to the freestream stagnation\nspeed of sound. This \u2018modified Rossiter equation\u2019 is\nused here to predict the frequencies of the various\noscillation modes in an open cavity flow\nf = U\u221e\nL\n(m \u2212 \u03b1)\nM\u221e[1 + ((\u03b3 \u2212 1)\/2)M 2\u221e]\u22121\/2 + (1\/K )\n(2)\nwhere \u03b1 is an empirical constant, related to the\nphase lag between instabilities in the shear layer and\nupstream-travelling pressure wave, which is depen-\ndent on the cavity length-to-depth ratio and is given\nby \u03b1 = 0.062(L\/H ).\nThe constant K is the empirical ratio of shear layer\nand freestream velocities; K = 0.57 is appropriate\nfor thin initial boundary layers but decreases with\nincreasing boundary layer thickness.\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009\nExperimental and computational investigation of an \u2018open\u2019 transonic cavity flow 359\nMany previous studies of cavity flows have con-\ncentrated on the time-averaged and unsteady mea-\nsurement of the flow using static pressure taps on\nthe surfaces and qualitative visualization techniques\nsuch as schlieren imagery and oil flow visualization\n[6\u20138]. The results of these studies have typically been\ncompared with numerical models with mixed suc-\ncess [9, 10]. There is currently very little data available\non the off-surface flowfield within different cavity\ngeometriesunder transonicconditions.Despite recent\nimprovements in optical measurement techniques\nsuch as particle image velocimetry (PIV) [11, 12] and\nlaser Doppler anemometry (LDA) [13], there appears\ntobe little, if any, quantitativeflowmeasurementof the\nstructure of a transonic cavity flow that is not confined\nto the centre-line of the cavity [14]. In this investiga-\ntion, we present results of applying PIV measurement\ntechniques to a transonic cavity flow and incorporate\nresults from surface pressure measurements, surface\nflow visualization, and numerical simulation to pro-\nduce an overall image of the flow structure in a\ntransonic cavity flow.\n2 EXPERIMENTATION\nAll tests were conducted using the Shrivenham tran-\nsonicwind tunnel (TWT), which has aworking section\nof 206mm (high) by 229mm (wide). This is a closed\ncircuit, ejector-driven tunnel supplied with air from\ntwo Howden screw-type compressors. The compres-\nsors supply air at up to 7bar(g), which is dried and\nstored in a 34m3 reservoir. The stored air is sufficient\nto run the tunnel at Mach 0.85 (the test condition for\nthe present measurements) for about 15 s.\nThe geometry of the cavity is indicated in Fig. 2,\ntogether with the co-ordinate systemused here and its\norigin.To enable optical access for PIVmeasurements,\nan all-glass cavity was mounted from the underside\nof a flat plate that had a sharp leading edge and was\nraised some 16mm away from the tunnel side wall\n(Fig. 3). Data could not be acquired for the first 2mm\nof the cavity depth due to the presence of the splitter\nplate. Similarly, the wind tunnel design does not allow\nthe freestream flow to bemeasured using PIV, because\nFig. 2 Cavity geometry and axis systems\nFig. 3 PIV experimental set-up\nof a lack of optical access but glass panels were fit-\nted in the flat plate upstream and downstream of the\ncavity to enable LDAmeasurements in the freestream.\nFor cavity floor pressure measurements and oil flow\nvisualization, an aluminium cavity was used. In each\ncase, the cavity had dimensions of L = 160mm, W =\n80mm (L\/W = 2). For the results presented here, the\ncavity had a depth of H = 32mm, to give L\/H = 5\n(other L\/H values were also tested but are not dis-\ncussed here). This resulted in a blockage ratio of 5\nper cent, which is well within acceptable limits for\nhigh-speed tunnel testing [15].\nAt M\u221e = 0.85, a freestream turbulence intensity of\n5\u20136 per cent was measured between 20 and 150mm\nabove theplaneof the cavity (y\/H = 0.63\u20134.7). Apitot\u2013\nstatic probe, located 30mm upstream of the cavity\nleading edge (x\/H = \u22120.94), was used to measure\nthe flow approaching the cavity. This revealed a tur-\nbulent boundary layer with thickness \u03b40.99 = 18.7mm\n(0.584H ), which can be expected to grow a further\n0.6mm by the leading edge of the cavity. This is much\nthicker than the natural TWT wall boundary layer at\nthispoint (6mm)andappears tobe the resultof a sepa-\nrationat theplate leadingedge, followedbya turbulent\nreattachment.\nA custom-built seeding system injected water parti-\ncles of 5\u201310\u00b5m diameter into the contraction section\nto seed the flow (Fig. 3). This size resulted in a seed-\ning response error of 2.3 per cent of the measured\nvelocity, using the error calculationmethod described\nby Dring [16]. The PIV acquisition system consisted\nof a Dantec FlowMap 500 processor, a Kodak ES1.0\nCCD camera, and a NewWave Gemini Nd:YAG pulsed\nlaser. The light sheet was projected into the cavity\nthrough the clear floor. The seeded light sheet was\nviewed perpendicularly via a surface-coated mirror\nangled at 45\u25e6 to the cavity right side wall (see Fig. 3).\nPIV data were taken for the same three x\u2013y planes\nacross the cavity onwhichpressuredatawere acquired\n(see below).\nJAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009 Proc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering\n360 K Atvars, K Knowles, S A Ritchie, and N J Lawson\nThe Kodak ES1.0 camera frame rate and laser repe-\ntition rate allowed data to be recorded at up to 15Hz.\nThis frame rate was too low to capture the unsteady\nphenomena in the cavity; hence, time-averaged flow\ndata derived from the instantaneous data are pre-\nsented from the PIV. (At least a 2 kHz system would be\nneeded before time-resolved data could be acquired\nsuccessfully at this scale.) Time averaging was per-\nformed in correlation space, which also improved\nthe resolution in regions where fewer particles had\nbeen entrained in the flow, such as in the cavity\nupstream recirculation region. A set of 700 image\npairs were acquired per run at a 15Hz sampling rate\nand processed into instantaneous vector maps using\na window-deformation FFT code; these were then\ntime averaged. To process the PIV images, DaVis soft-\nware by La Vision was used. The software employs\nan iterative image-deformation algorithm, similar to\nthose reviewed by Scarano [17], which more effec-\ntively extracts vectors from complex rotating flows\nwith high velocity gradients (as seen in open cavity\nflows). The window-deformation technique deforms\nthe interrogation region in the second frame accord-\ning to the velocity gradient present within that region.\nThis leads to identicaldisplacements forall the seeding\nparticles within a region giving an improved signal-\nto-noise ratio and thus higher accuracy. To process\nthe images, four passes were used with two passes\nat 32 \u00d7 32 pixels and two passes at 16 \u00d7 16 pixels.\nAll regions were 75 per cent overlapped in x and y.\nTo aid clarity, the vector maps presented here were\npost-processed by sub-sampling by a factor of 3.\nBased on the seeding response, the geometry error,\nand the processing error, estimated accuracy in this\ncase is better than 3.4 per cent of full-scale mea-\nsurement. The accuracy of the PIV measurements\ncould have been increased by using seeding particles\nwith sub-micron diameters; however, this would then\nrequire greater laser power to scatter an equivalent\namount of light,whichwasnot possible for thepresent\ntests.\nSurface flow visualizations were performed using a\nparaffin-based solution containing solar yellow flu-\norescent paint particles. By subjecting the particles\nto ultraviolet light, the surface flow patterns were\nclearly visible andcouldbephotographedusingdigital\nstill photography. Cavity floor pressures were mea-\nsured using three rows of nine pressure tappings each,\nat z\/W = 0.5, 0.667, and 0.833 (referred to as the\nCL, OC1, and OC2 planes, respectively). These tap-\npings were connected via 46 cm lengths of tubing of a\nknown frequency response to a Scanivalve ZOC block\nelectronically-scanned pressure transducer contain-\ning 32 piezo-resistive pressure sensors.Measurements\nwere taken at a sample rate of 10 kHz, and filtered at\n5 kHz with a resolution of approximately 5Hz; 65 536\nsamples were taken at each of four TWT runs and\naveraged.\n3 COMPUTATION\nNumerical simulation data were obtained using time-\naveraged unsteady, Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes\n(URANS) CFD predictions.

IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J. Aerospace Engineering JAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009\nExperimental and computational investigation of an \u2018open\u2019 transonic cavity flow 361\nused here employed the Fluent commercial code and\nadopted the realizable \u03ba \u2212 \u03b5 turbulence model. This\nturbulence model was chosen as it includes modifi-\ncations over the standard \u03ba \u2212 \u03b5 model, which makes\nit more suitable for use in flows containing regions of\nhigh shear and swirl [18].\nPrevious work has shown that open-type cavity\nflows are largely symmetrical about the centreline\nplane, when time averaged [19]. For the present work,\nthiswas confirmedby comparing full andhalf-domain\ncalculations in termsofmeanflowstructure andmode\nshapes; although not identical, both agreed equally\nwell with experiments. For most of the results pre-\nsented here, therefore, only half of the domain was\ncalculated, with symmetry imposed on the centre-\nline plane. This greatly reducing the computational\nrequirements, but at the expense of suppressing any\nlateral oscillationmodes. Amesh refinement study led\nto the adoption of a mesh containing 952 000 quadri-\nlateral cells (for the half domain, twice this for the full\ndomain), which was found to be sufficient to resolve\naccurately theRossitermodes (see reference [20]).This\nmesh had an increasing number of cells closer to the\nedges of the cavity (Fig. 4). Approximately 20 cells were\nused to resolve the boundary layer profile upstream of\nthe cavity, with a minimum cell height chosen to give\ny+ values of the order of unity. This boundary layer\nprofilewas specified tomatch theexperimentallymea-\nsured profile. Calculations were also performed with a\nmuch thinner, naturally growing (but tripped) turbu-\nlent boundary layer approaching the cavity [20]. The\nupstream and downstream domain boundaries (inlet\nand outlet) were located 2L from the cavity leading\nedge and trailing edge, respectively. The distance from\nthe surface plane to the upper domain boundary was\nalso 2L, whichwas found to reproduce freestreamflow\nconditions at that boundary.\nThe time step was defined by the sampling rate\nrequired to resolve the second Rossiter mode with 50\ndatapoints [21]. At this timestepof\u0006t = 1. 76 \u00d7 10\u22125 s,\nthe results had also been found to have converged,\nbased on themeasurements of the first Rossitermode.\nThe simulation was initially run to achieve a steady\nsolution, as determined by the static pressure at the\nmid-height of the downstream wall of the cavity vary-\ning by <1 per cent. Then the unsteady solution was\nattained over a further 20 000 time steps, which also\nensured transients from start-up had been purged.\n4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n4.1 Time-averaged pressure data\nThe experimental and numerical time-averaged pres-\nsure coefficient (Cp) data are shown for the three\nplanes within the cavity in Fig. 5. Although the general\nlevels of Cp are similar in the two data sets, it is clear\nFig. 5 Comparison of mean pressure coefficient pro-\nfiles: experiment versus 3D CFD, half-domain\nsimulation\nthat the form of the pressure distributions is different;\nthis will be discussed below.\nBoth the experiments and the CFD show only small\ndifferences in pressure distribution between the three\nplanes (CL, OC1, and OC2). In general for both cases\nthe further from the centreline the lower the pressure,\nsuggesting slightly higher velocities nearer the side-\nwalls. This small effect is, however, less apparent in\nthe CFD than the experiments.\nThe CFD results show fairly uniform pressure (CP\nclose to zero) for approximately 80 per cent of the\ncavity length, before a sharp increase near the down-\nstream wall. This form is typical of an open flow, as\nsuggestedbyStallings andco-workers [2,3] and shown\nin Fig. 1. By contrast, the experimental Cp along the\nfirst 60 per cent of the cavity floor is slightly nega-\ntive, reaching aminimum at approximately x\/L = 0.4.\nCp continues rising over the downstream 40 per cent\nof the cavity length, reaching a maximum recorded\nvalue at x\/L = 0.9. These experimental pressure dis-\ntributions within the cavity are typical of flow on the\nboundary between open-type and transitional-open-\ntype flows (see Fig. 1). It is suggested here that this\nis probably due to the thick boundary layer in the\npresent experiments. Although this effect could not\nbe reproduced fully by the CFD, it was seen in all our\nexperimental studies on other cavity geometries: in\neach case the pressure distribution was typical of a\nhigher length-to-depth ratio than that being tested.\nDespite this difference (between CFD and experi-\nments), the internal structure of the cavity flow is\nlargely unaffected by this apparent transition [22].\n4.2 Unsteady pressure data\nFigure 6 shows the unsteady pressure spectra from\nthe pressure tapping at x\/L = 0.9 on the CL plane for\nJAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009 Proc.

The second mode shows a\nbroader peak in the experimental data but this is also\nat a similar frequency to the prediction of themodified\nRossiter equation (equation (2)).\nThe numerical simulation shows slightly higher fre-\nquencies than the experiments for the first and third\nmodes, but both are within about 10 per cent of the\ntheoretical values (which do not vary with spanwise\nposition). There is no change in first mode frequency\nand only a small change (4Hz) in the third com-\nputed mode between the three planes. There are no\nsecond mode peaks visible in the numerical simu-\nlation spectra above the background noise level for\nany of the three planes. The cavity is shown to be\noscillating with a first mode dominance in both the\nexperimental and numerical cases, which suggests\nthat the simulation has successfully predicted the\noscillation feedbackmechanismwithin the cavity. The\nnumerical first mode peak sound pressure level (SPL)\nof 155dB compares with 161dB seen experimentally.\nThe highest-frequency oscillation mode in both the\nexperimental and numerical data is the third mode,\nafter which the background noise level swamps any\nfrequency peaks.\nThe issue of simulating the flow with a plane of\nsymmetry can also be addressed indirectly by look-\ning at unsteady pressure spectra. It is known that\nasymmetric flow inside a cavity correlates with a\nsecond Rossiter mode dominance in the pressure\nspectrum [23]. The second mode appears to be much\nreduced in the experimental case and appears to be\ncompletely absent in any discernable form from the\nCFD results.This absence of second-modedominance\ninbothCFDandexperimental results suggests that the\nFig. 7 Surface flow patterns: (a) experimental flow\nvisualization; (b) surface streamlines from 3D\nCFD, half-domain simulation, \u2018thin\u2019 boundary\nlayer; and (c) sidewall streamlines from 3D CFD,\nfull-domain simulation, \u2018thin\u2019 boundary layer\nProc.

A full-domain\nthree-dimensional (3D) simulation (discussed further\nbelow) has also qualitatively shown good agreement\nwith the symmetry condition.\n4.3 Surface flow visualization\nThe pressure coefficient profiles and unsteady spec-\ntra have been used to identify the type of flow and\noscillation modes occurring within the cavity; a more\ndetailed description of the flow behaviour and struc-\nture, however, is not possible from these data alone.\nDescriptionof theflowbehaviour canbe furtherdevel-\noped with reference to the surface flow visualization\nstudy.\nThe experimental and computational surface flow\npatterns are presented in Fig. 7. Note that the exper-\nimental images of the side and end walls (Fig. 7(a))\ninclude some perspective error; so, in each case, the\ndiagonal line along the edge of the image is a corner\nof the cavity. In both the experimental and numerical\ncases, the streamlines on the floor of the cavity show\nthat the flow is travelling against the freestream direc-\ntion over most of the cavity length and width, which\nis consistent with a large single recirculation region\nin the cavity rotating clockwise for a freestream flow\ntravelling left to right.\nThe CFD results in Fig. 7(b) show a similar pat-\ntern on the cavity floor to the experiments, but the\nsidewall reveals that the main recirculation region\nis further downstream than that in the experiments.\nThese CFD results have been produced with a thin,\n\u2018natural\u2019 boundary layer approaching the cavity: the\nimposition of the thick, experimental boundary layer\nproduced an even more downstream position for\nthe main recirculation. The full-domain calculations,\nwhich were only conducted with the thin boundary\nlayer, give surface flow patterns (Fig. 7(c)) that are very\nsimilar to those seen in Fig. 7(b).\nIn both the experiments and the CFD, the cav-\nity floor streamlines show two contra-rotating flow\nstructures on either side of the centreline plane with\nflow rotation towards the centreline of the cavity,\nmuch like a focus sink. The structures are described\nin ESDU Item 02008 [24] as \u2018tornado-like\u2019 vortices,\nwhich spiral up towards the mouth plane (i.e. the\nopen plane) of the cavity. Their subsequent trajec-\ntory is not speculated on in reference [24] but will\nbe discussed further in the next section. These struc-\ntures are formed when the flow travelling upstream\nalong the floor of the cavity reaches the natural flow\nboundary formed by the upstreamwall.

When the flow reaches the CL plane, it meets the\nflow from the other side of the centreline and is forced\nto turn to flow downstream but is prevented from\ndoing so by the flow travelling upstream along the\ncavity floor. The flow is forced to turn out towards\nthe sidewall of the cavity, which forms the vertical\n\u2018tornado-like\u2019 structures seen on the cavity floor. Note\nthat similar structures are still seen in \u2018closed\u2019-type\ncavity flows (for higher length-to-depth ratios than\nused here) but their sense of rotation is reversed [24].\nFig. 9 LIC images of the PIV-derived velocity vector fields: (a) CL plane; (b) OC1 plane; and (c)\nOC2 plane\nFig. 10 LIC images of OC1 plane: (a) PIV results; (b) CFD results with a half-domain simulation;\nand (c) CFD results with a full domain simulation.

Aerospace Engineering JAERO445 \u00a9 IMechE 2009\nExperimental and computational investigation of an \u2018open\u2019 transonic cavity flow 365\nOur recent CFD calculations suggest that only one\n\u2018tornado-like\u2019 vortex exists for narrow cavities with\nW \/H = 1.\n4.4 Flowfield data\nFigure 8 shows the PIV-derived vector maps for the\nthree planes within the experimental cavity. The peak\nvelocity magnitude in the centreline (CL) plane is\napproximately 140m\/s (52 per cent of freestream\nvalue), which is seen in the deflected shear layer near\nthe downstream wall. The peak vertical velocity in\nthis plane is v = 80m\/s and occurs directly adjacent\nto the downstream wall. The shear layer was seen to\nhave a deep deflection into the cavity at the down-\nstream wall. This causes an acceleration of the flow\nover the deflected shear layer into the cavity near the\ndownstream wall, which is where the 140m\/s peak\nvelocity was measured.\nThe OC1 mean flowfield is similar to that on the\ncentreline, with virtually identical peak velocity mag-\nnitude (140m\/s) and peak vertical velocity (80m\/s).\nThe OC2 plane shows a quite different flow structure\nand lower peak velocities: the peak velocitymagnitude\nis approximately 100m\/s (37 per cent of freestream\nvalue) and the peak vertical velocity is approximately\nv = \u00b130m\/s. These lower peak velocities in the OC2\nplane appear because the shear layer is no longer\ndeflected into the cavity but instead is elevated above\nthe level of the mouth plane by the proximity to the\nsidewall.\nTo improve visualization of the velocity data, line\nintegral convolution (LIC) images [25] of the derived\nstreamlines are presented in Fig. 9 for the three planes\nin the experimental data. These show a single large\nrecirculation whose centremoves slightly upstream as\nthe sidewall is approached. On the OC2 plane, how-\never, there are clearly two recirculation regions and\ninspection of the vector maps reveals that these are\nco-rotating. This will be discussed further below with\ntheaidof theCFD.Thepeakvertical velocity in theOC2\nplane occurs in the vertical motion regions of this sec-\nond recirculation, rather than being associated with\nthe shear layer impinging on the downstream wall as\nin the CL and OC1 planes.\nThe numerical data from both the half-domain and\nfull-domain simulations are comparedwith the exper-\niments in terms of LIC plots for the OC1 plane in\nFig. 10. In both the computational cases, the \u2018thin\u2019\nupstream boundary layer was used. It can be seen\nthat both CFD results contain a large recirculation\nregion but that this is further downstream than that\nin the experiment; this is consistent with the surface\nflow visualization results discussed above. The full-\ndomain CFD also shows some form of vertical flow\nstructure towards the upstream wall; this is not clear\nin the experiment because of the poor flow seeding\ndensity in this region. Something similar is seen in the\nhalf-domain calculation but the most prominent fea-\nture in this case is a second recirculation in the upper\nhalf of the cavity; this only appears in plane OC2 for\nthe full-domain calculation. It is worth noting that the\nfull-domain and half-domain CFD calculations give\nvery similarflowfieldson theCL plane,withagreement\nas close as is seen in the sidewall flow visualizations\n(Fig. 7).\nThe full, 3D flowfield within the cavity can only\nbe visualized from the CFD data. Care must be\ntaken to refer to experimental evidence wherever\npossible because of the differences between the\nCFD and experiments. It should also be borne\nin mind that we are presenting here time-mean\nFig. 11 Visualization of the three-dimensional CFD\nflowfield; full-domain simulation: (a) view from\nin front of the cavity looking downstream, front\nand side walls removed for clarity; (b) side view\nof cavity with side wall removed for clarity,\nfreestream flow from left to right; and (c) view\nlooking upstream from the back wall (removed\nfor clarity, together with the side walls).

Figure 11(a) shows the two \u2018tornado-like\u2019\nvortices in the upstream third of the cavity, with the\nsingle, large recirculation further downstream. Also\nvisible in this figure are two vortices trailing down-\nstream from thedownstreamcorners of the cavity: this\nfeature is consistent with the surface flow visualiza-\ntions of Taborda et al. [7] (see also reference [24]). The\nside view of the cavity flowfield in Fig. 11(b) can be\ncompared with the surface flow visualizations of Fig. 7\nand with the experimental LIC visualizations of Fig. 9.\nAs has been pointed out above, the CFD is showing a\nmain recirculation, which is somewhat further down-\nstream than seen in the experiments. Aside from this\ndifference, however, the global features of the mean\nCFD flowfield agree well with the experimental evi-\ndence of Figs 7 and 9. In particular, the CFD reveals\nhow the second recirculation region seen in Fig. 9(c)\nrelates to the sidewall flow patterns of Fig. 7(a) and\nthe downstream trailing vortices. This aspect is further\nclarified by the view shown in Fig. 11(c).This upstream\nview of the downstream wall of the cavity also reveals\na small corner vortex between the floor and end wall,\nwhich is consistent with the experimental surface flow\nvisualization (Fig. 7(a)).\nFig. 12 Visualization of three-dimensional CFD: DES\ncourtesy of Bidur Khanal (unpublished);\nM\u221e = 0.85, L\/H = 5, W \/H = 2, thick experi-\nmental boundary layer; view from in front of\nthe cavity looking downstream, front and side\nwalls removed for clarity. Streamtraces coloured\nby velocity magnitude\nA key question that arises over the \u2018tornado-like\u2019\nvortices concerns their trajectory above thefloor of the\ncavity. In ESDUData Item 02008 [24], it is conjectured\nthat they are more or less vertical; their fate on\nreaching the mouth plane of the cavity is not dis-\ncussed. From Fig. 11(a) it can be seen that flow from\nthese vortices is swept downstream and enters the\nmain cavity recirculation. This is shown more clearly\nin Fig. 12, which is the result of a detached eddy\nsimulation (DES; i.e. a hybrid large eddy simulation\n(LES)\/Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS)) cal-\nculation on a similar geometry to the experiments\n(only the width is slightly different) with the thick\nexperimental boundary layer imposed upstream.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe current study of an empty L\/H = 5 rectangu-\nlar cavity in a transonic freestream has integrated\nexperimental and numerical techniques to gain a\ndetailed insight into the three-dimensional flow\nbehaviour throughout the cavity. Besides surface flow\nvisualization, the experiments have measured mean\nand unsteady pressures on the cavity floor, and mean\nvelocities on three planes inside the cavity. Numeri-\ncal flowfield predictions have used an unsteady RANS\nmodel.\nThe mean pressure distribution inside the exper-\nimental cavity suggests a flow on the boundary\nbetween \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018transitional-open\u2019. This is felt to\nbe because of the thickness of the boundary layer\n(approximately half the cavity depth) in the experi-\nments.This effect couldnot be completely reproduced\nby the present URANS modelling, although changing\nthe boundary layer thickness did change the predicted\nflowfield significantly. The CFD, even with the experi-\nmental boundary layer imposed, showsa typical \u2018open\u2019\nflow pressure distribution.\nA strong oscillation feedback mechanism is present\nwithin the cavity. Both the experimental and numer-\nical unsteady pressure spectra show up to the\nthird Rossiter mode of oscillation; experimental\nmode frequencies have excellent agreement with the\ntheoretical values calculated using the \u2018modified-\nRossiter\u2019 equation (equation (2)). The cavity flow is\nseen to oscillate in first mode dominance with a peak\nSPL of approximately 160dB. The CFD shows reason-\nable agreement in terms of frequencies and peak SPLs.\nThere is, however, no clear second Rossiter mode in\nthe half-domain CFD results, possibly because of the\nassumption of lateral symmetry.\nFlow visualization (both surface oil and PIV derived)\nshows a single main recirculation in the body of the\ncavity, with two vertically oriented \u2018tornado-like\u2019 vor-\ntices upstream of this. The CFD shows the same key\nflow features, albeit with the main recirculation pre-\ndicted further downstream. Nevertheless, the CFD is\nProc. IMechE Vol. 223 Part G: J.

Thus, it appears that\nthe \u2018tornado-like\u2019 vortices bend downstream and are\nswept into the main recirculation region. Close to the\ndownstream corners of the cavity two vortices leave\nthe main recirculation and trail downstream away\nfrom the cavity.\nMore detailed analysis of the unsteady behaviour\nof \u2018open\u2019 cavity flowfields will require a time-resolved\nPIV system, with kHz repetition rates, and a hybrid\nLES\/RANS CFD approach.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the UK\u2019s Engineering\nandPhysical SciencesResearchCouncil andMBDAUK\nLtd for their support of the project under the Cooper-\native Awards in Science and Engineering studentship\nscheme.
