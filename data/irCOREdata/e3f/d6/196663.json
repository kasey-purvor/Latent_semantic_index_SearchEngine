The risk of listeriosis is also markedly increased in\nimmunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS [3].\nIn meningitis, bacteria in the cerebrospinal fluid are separated\nfrom the neuronal tissue adjacent to the ventricular system and\naqueducts, by the ependyma. The ependyma is a single,\nuninterrupted, layer of ciliated cells that lines the cerebral\nventricles, cerebral aqueducts and the central canal of the spinal\ncord. Each ependymal cell has approximately 40 cilia that beat\ncontinuously at a frequency of around 40 Hz, moving the CSF\nclose to the ventricular wall, in the direction of CSF flow [4]. In\naddition, the ependymal cilia are thought to act as a barrier to\npathogen infection of the underlying neuronal tissue [5]. Prior to\nthe entry of listeria into the cells of the brain the bacteria need to\novercome this mechanical beating of the cilia. Abnormal\nmovement of the ependymal cilia has been strongly linked to the\ndevelopment of hydrocephalus [6,7,8].\nDuring meningitis caused by L. monocytogenes, bacteria have been\nshown to be present inside ependymal [9] and neuronal [10] cells,\nas well as in the cerebrospinal fluid [9,11,12]. However, the details\nof L. monocytogenes attachment to ciliated ependymal cells and\nsubsequent invasion are poorly understood.\nThe expression of genes required for invasion, intracellular\nsurvival and listerial cell to cell spread is dependent upon a\ntranscriptional activator known as PrfA (positive regulatory factor\nA) [13,14,15]. PrfA was first identified as a regulatory factor\nrequired for listeriolysin-O transcription and has since been shown\nto regulate the expression of a large number of bacterial gene\nproducts directly associated with virulence [16]. To date, only 10\nof the 2,853 coding sequences of the L. monocytogenes EGDe genome\n[17] have been confirmed to be directly regulated by PrfA [18,19].\nIt is thought that PrfA serves as a switch enabling L. monocytogenes\ntransition from the outside environment into an animal host [20].\nThe absolute requirement of PrfA for L. monocytogenes virulence has\nbeen demonstrated, as has the requirement for several genes within\nthe PrfA regulon [21,22]. Strains with mutations within the PrfA\ngene failed to replicate within the cytosol of host cells or failed to\nspread into adjacent cells [15,21]. These mutants also were severely\nattenuated for virulence in murine models of listeriosis [21].\nMaterials and Methods\nPreparation of bacterial suspensions\nListeria monocytogenes strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.\nListeria were grown in 200 ml tryptose soya broth overnight at\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10450\n37uC with shaking at 200 rpm. The bacteria were then\nsedimented (4,0006g for 10 min) and re-suspended in 10 ml\nmedium 199 (Invitrogen, UK) containing 10% v\/v glycerol and\nstored at 270uC until required. Before use, frozen stocks were\nthawed at room temperature. Numbers of viable bacteria were\ndetermined by colony counting on tryptose soya broth agar plates.\nFor growth of EGDe DprfA and 10403S DprfA, 5 mg\/ml\nerythromycin was added to the medium. For use, listeria were\ndiluted to 26108 cfu\/ml in tissue culture medium 199.\nEpendymal cell culture\nThe research using new born rat brains was conducted\naccording to national guidelines under the UK, Animals (Scientific\nProcedures) Act 1986 and all animals were born in the University\nof Leicester Biomedical Sciences Unit. The research on the ex-vivo\ntissue was approved by the University of Leicester ethics\ncommittee.\nAn adaptation of a previously described method [23] was used to\ngrow the ependymal cells. Eight-well rectangular (25635 mm)\ntissue culture trays (Fisher, UK) were coated with bovine fibronectin\n(35 mg\/cm2) and were incubated at 37uC in 5% CO2 for 2 hours\nbefore use. Following cervical dislocation, the brains of newborn (1\nto 2 day old) Wistar rats were removed. The cerebellum was\nremoved, as were small (3 mm) edge regions of the frontal cortex\nand the left and right cortical hemispheres. The remaining brain\nregions (containing ependymal cells and ventricles) were mechan-\nically dissociated in 2 ml of tissue culture medium 199 [24].\nDissociated tissue from each brain was seeded (500 ml\/well) into the\nwells of 25635 mm tissue culture trays; each well contained 2 ml of\nmedium. The medium was serum-free minimum essential medium\n(Gibco Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) containing penicillin\n(100 IU\/ml), streptomycin (100 mg\/ml), fungizone (2.5 mg\/ml),\nbovine serum albumin (5 mg\/ml), insulin (5 mg\/ml), transferrin\n(10 mg\/ml), selenium (5 mg\/ml) (Invitrogen, UK) and from day 3\nonward, thrombin (0.5 IU\/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) [24]. The\nmedium was replaced on day 3 after seeding. Thereafter, the\nadherent ependymal cells were fed by the replacement of 2 ml of\nmedium, three times a week [24]. The ependymal cells grew as\ncolonies within the wells and the beating cilia were used to identify\nthem at day 5. The ciliated cells were used for experiments when\ncells were around two weeks old [23]. The number of cells in each\nwell varied between 1000\u201310000 cells. The experiments were done\nin 8.58 cm2 wells in 2 ml of media containing 18 cfu\/ml, and if we\ncorrect for volume above the cells for an average cell colony surface\narea (4800 cells, each 10 mm in diameter, ,0.48 mm262.3 mm\nheight of media above the colony = 1.1 mm3). The total volume\nadded was 12.6 mm3, therefore, the cells will be in contact with\n28 cfu\/(12.6\/1.1)\/4800 approximately equal to 3654 bacteria per\ncell. Before use the MEM medium was completely removed from\neach well and the cells were washed 5 times with PBS and 1 ml of\nmedium 199 was added to each well. For infection, 1 ml of L.\nmonocytogenes suspension was added, to give a final concentration of\n16108 cfu\/ml.\nMeasurement of ciliary beat frequency\nCiliary beat frequency was measured as previously described\n[24,25]. Briefly, trays of ependymal cells were placed in a\nhumidified (80 to 90% humidity) thermostatically controlled\n(37uC) incubation chamber on a light microscope stage (Diphot;\nNikon). All measurements were taken with the solution temper-\nature between 36.5 and 37.5uC and the pH between 7.35 and\n7.45. Beating cilia were recorded (32x objective) using a\ntroubleshooter 1000 high speed video camera (Lake Image\nSystems Ltd, UK) at 500 frames per second. All video files were\ncreated using the AVI video format. For viewing the AVI\nfiles MiDAS 4.0 player software (http:\/\/www.xcitex.com\/html\/\ndownloads.php) was used. Video sequences were played back\neither at reduced frame rates or frame by frame and ciliary beat\nfrequency was determined by timing a pre-selected number of\nindividual ciliary beat cycles. At each time point, measurements of\ntwenty individual cilia from the same colony of cells were made\nand averaged. This was repeated in 5\u201311 independent experi-\nments (i.e. A total of 100\u2013220 CBF readings were made).\nMeasurement of ciliary beat amplitude\nCilia were viewed using an inverted microscope (Diphot; Nikon,\nUK). High-speed video recordings were made, as described above,\nto measure ciliary beat frequency. Slow motion playback of the\nhigh-speed video recordings enabled us to visualise the cilia tips.\nWe were then able to determine the maximum forwards\nmovement of the cilia and the maximum backwards movement\nof the cilia tips. The distance travelled between these two points\nwas measured on the display screen and defined as the ciliary beat\namplitude.\nFor each experiment, five different regions (62.5 mm6140 mm)\nof ciliated ependyma were chosen at random and from each area\nfive measurements of ciliary beat amplitude were made. If listeria\naggregates were seen, five readings were taken from cilia covered\nby these aggregates and five readings from cilia outside these areas.\nThe amplitude of the ciliary beat in the control that was not\nexposed to listeria was defined as 100%.\nMeasurement of bacterial aggregation\nStill photographs were obtained from various stages of the\nexperiment. Each photograph was equivalent to 62.5 mm6\n140 mm of the ciliated ependyma. From these photographs, the\nperimeter of L. monocytogenes aggregates was determined by image\nanalysis. The percentage of ciliated tissue covered by listerial\naggregate was determined for each sample.\nScanning electron microscopy\nEpendymal cells were fixed with 4% v\/v glutaraldehyde in\nSorensen\u2019s buffer (pH 7.4) [24] for 48 hours and then rinsed 3\ntimes in Sorensen\u2019s buffer. The cells were post-fixed in 1% w\/v\nosmium tetroxide for 1 hour and rinsed in Sorensen\u2019s buffer. The\nsamples were then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series and\nimmersed in hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The HMDS was\nallowed to evaporate, leaving the cells fixed to aluminium scanning\nelectron microscope stubs. These were then sputter-coated with\ngold prior to examination [24].\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation of 5 to\n11 independent experiments.

The Bonferroni correction test was used for repeated\nmeasurements.\nResults\nInteraction of wild type L. monocytogenes and ciliated\nependymal cells\nEpendymal cells from newborn Wistar rats were grown in\nculture until ciliated (Fig. 1A, 1B and S1) and then were incubated\nwith wild-type strains of L. monocytogenes for three hours at 37uC.\nThe behaviour of both the ependymal cilia and the listeria were\naltered in these co-cultures but the alterations were dependent on\nthe strain of L. monocytogenes.\nThe first strain studied was L. monocytogenes 10403S. In the\npresence of ependymal cells the bacteria aggregated and by three\nhours about 10% of the surface area of the ependymal cell culture\nwas covered by listerial aggregates that were attached to the\nunderlying cilia (Table 2). Scanning electron microscopy revealed\nthat the vast majority of the 10403S aggregates consisted of\nbacteria within an extracellular material (Fig. 1C). However,\noccasional aggregates of bacteria associated with cilia but without\nextracellular material were also revealed (Fig. 1D).\nAt three hours post-infection there was no significant difference\n(P.0.05) in the ciliary beat frequency of cells incubated with\n10403S and the control (incubated in medium alone; Table 2,\nVideo S2). However, the amplitude of the beating cilia covered by\nbacterial aggregates was markedly reduced (36% of the control\nvalue, P,0.001, Table 3). The ciliary beat amplitude of cilia not\ncovered by bacterial aggregates was also reduced compared to\ncontrol but to a much lesser extent (88% of the control value,\nP,0.001, Table 3). To determine if listerial cell free extract effects\nthe cilia, lysates of 10403S (108 cfu) were prepared by the addition\nof antibiotic (penicillin, ampicillin or gentamicin), these were\nadded to the ependymal cilia, and over 3 hours had no effect on\nCBF and beat pattern (data not shown).\nTo investigate if the findings with L. monocytogenes strain 10403S\nwere strain specific; the study was repeated with two other wild-\ntype strains of L. monocytogenes, C52 and EGDe. After three hours\nincubation with C52, in contrast to 10403S there was a significant\nreduction in ciliary beat frequency (P,0.001, Table 2). The\nbacteria were seen to be attached to and moving in time with the\nbeat of the cilia but no extracellular material or bacterial\naggregates were seen. The amplitude of the cilia after incubation\nwith C52 was reduced significantly compared to the control (67%\nof the control value, P,0.001, Table 3).\nAfter three hours incubation with EGDe, there was no decrease\nin ciliary beat frequency compared to the control (Table 2, Video\nS1). Incubation with the EGDe strain initially resulted in long\nchains of bacteria attaching to the cilia, moving at the same beat\nfrequency as the cilia (Video S3). After three hours there were\nlarge areas of bacterial aggregates in an extracellular material\n(Video S4). Approximately 61% of the surface area of the\nependymal cell culture was covered by listerial aggregates in\nassociation with extracellular material (Table 2, Fig. 1E and 1F).\nThe SEM image in Figure 2 shows strands of material between the\nwild type EGDe strain. Where aggregates were present, there was\na 64% reduction in ciliary amplitude (P,0.001, Table 3). Where\ncilia were not covered by listerial aggregates, the ciliary beat\namplitude was also decreased by 19% (P,0.001, Table 3). The\nreduction in ciliary amplitude appeared to be dependent on the\nsize of the bacterial aggregates. The ciliary amplitude at 3 hours\nco-culture was markedly reduced compared to the 2 hour\namplitude, at which time the bacterial aggregates were smaller\n(data not shown). From confocal images we occasionally saw\nbacteria inside the cells, but the majority of cells were not seen to\nbe infected (data not shown). With each strain, bacterial aggregates\nand extracellular material formed only during contact between the\nependymal cells and the bacteria. No aggregates or extracellular\nmaterial were visible after incubation of the bacteria and medium\ntaken from the ependymal cell cultures.\nA role for PrfA\nCiliated ependymal cells were incubated with DprfA mutants of\nEGDe and 10403S for three hours at 37uC. The C52 DprfA\nmutant was not available. In contrast to the wild-types, no\naggregates or extracellular material were observed with the DprfA\nmutants (Table 2). As with the wild-types, the mutants had no\neffect on ciliary beat frequency (Table 2). Although there was\nsignificant reduction in ciliary beat amplitude of the cells\nincubated with EGDDprfA and 10403SDprfA (P,0.001, Table 3),\nthe reduction was not significantly different (P.0.05) from the\nwild-types (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn this study we investigated the effect of L. monocytogenes on\nependymal cilia to improve our understanding of the pathophys-\niology of listerial meningitis. Three aspects of the results are\nnoteworthy: the strain-specific effect of listeria on the ependyma,\nthe presence of aggregates of listeria on the cilia and the\ndissociation of ciliary beat frequency from beat amplitude.\nThe introduction of high speed digital video imaging has\nallowed us to measure the amplitude of beating cilia in an\nependymal culture system and to simultaneously determine their\nciliary beat frequency [26,27]. At a concentration seen in the rat\nbrain during listerial meningitis [9,11,12], three of the wild-type L.\nmonocytogenes strains studied were capable of decreasing the ciliary\namplitude. However only strain C52 significantly reduced ciliary\nbeat frequency. A different strain-specific pattern was seen with\naggregation around cilia, with EGDe showing the greatest\naggregation but no aggregation of C52. Aggregates were most\noften seen in the presence of extracellular matrix. The reasons for\nthese strain differences are not clear. Inter-strain variation in\nlisteria has been previously reported, for example, in adhesion to\nabiotic surfaces [28] and in response to sodium chloride and low\npH [29]. Those results and the data from this study indicate that\ncaution must be observed when extrapolating from results with a\nsingle strain of L. monocytogenes.\nAdherence of pathogens to host cells is pre-requisite for cell\ninvasion [30,31]. In this study we showed that listeria attached to\nependymal cells but an unexpected observation was the extensive\naggregation of the listeria attached to cilia, but no attachment to\nother parts of the ependymal cells. The rapid adhesion of listeria to\nependymal cilia and the marked aggregation of listeria with the\nformation of extracellular material may help to explain why CSF\nsamples taken clinically from patients with listerial meningitis\ncontain relatively small numbers of listeria. Interaction between\nthe listeria and cilia is necessary for aggregate formation but direct\ninteractions between individual bacteria cells also is occurring.\nSignificantly, aggregates were only found physically attached to\nthe cilia with no aggregates in the culture medium or in spent\nculture medium. Incubation of each bacterial strain and spent\nsupernatant (supernatant from a previous experiment) did not\nresult in bacterial aggregate formation, indicating that bacterial\naggregates and extracellular material formed as a result of contact\nbetween the ependymal cells and the bacteria. Although it remains\nListeria Infects Brain Cilia\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10450\nto be determined if this material is secreted by the ependymal cells\nor the bacteria. It seems that signalling events are occurring,\npresumably after initial cilium\/listeria attachment, resulting in a\nchange in the surface phenotype of the bound listeria, which leads\nto more bacteria binding. In some instances extracellular material\nwas visible and where present it may contribute to the formation of\nthe aggregate but this material is not a prerequisite for aggregation\nbecause aggregates are found in the absence of this material. The\nformation of these bacterial aggregates may benefit the listeria by\nstabilising contact with the ependyma and by slowing CSF\nFigure 1.

To our knowledge such\ndissociation has not been reported before. Therefore, in order to\ndetermine effects on overall ciliary function, measurement of\nciliary beat frequency and pattern should be used. For cilia\nassociated with listerial aggregates, a \u2018drag\u2019 effect due to the\nattached aggregates is likely to contribute to decreased amplitude.\nHowever, in the case of C52 no aggregates were formed thus a\n\u2018non-mechanical\u2019 mechanism is possible. It is also possible that the\nviscosity of the medium surrounding the cilia is increased.\nHowever, these points do not explain the maintenance of beat\nfrequency. Indeed, one may expect an increase in frequency if\namplitude was reduced. An unchanged frequency of the beat\nstroke, even when the distance travelled (amplitude) decreases,\nsuggests there is a fixed timing of intra-cilium events between\nciliary strokes. Future investigations are required to decipher these\nmechanisms. However, before we can deduce any pneumococcal\nmechanism of interference, what can be said is that the successful\ninvasion of ependymal cells by listeria does not appear to play a\nrole in this, because the majority of cells were not infected during\nthe 3 hour time course of this study.\nWe recently studied the effect of viscosity on ependymal cells\n[32] and found an increase in viscous loading was followed by a\nrapid decrease in the frequency of ependymal cilia to a level that\nwas maintained while the increased viscous load was present. The\nciliary beat amplitude was not affected with low viscous loads (1\u2013\n40 cP) but was reduced at higher viscosities (60 cP). These results\nare similar to the effects of increasing viscosity respiratory and\noviductal ciliary beat frequency [33]. Johnson and colleagues [33]\nfound no significant reduction in beat amplitude over a viscosity\nrange of 1\u2013150 cP. Of interest they found that at levels above\n180 cP ciliary activity became very unpredictable. Cilia either\nstopped beating, just slowed down or seemed to beat more quickly\nwith a short amplitude. Insight into the mechanism of autoreg-\nulation of ciliary beat frequency following exposure to changes in\nviscosity was provided by Andrade and colleagues [34]. They\nfound that changes in mucous viscosity activate vanilloid 4-like\n(TRPV4) channels that elevate intracellular Ca+2. They also found\nchannel opening requires the activity of phospholipase A2. This\noccurs at high viscous loads allowing cilia to adapt to a wide range\nof viscosities.\nBacterial pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, are known to\nform structured populations of microorganisms, adhered and\nembedded in an extracellular matrix consisting mainly of\nexopolysaccharides (biofilms) [35]. It is thought that these biofilm\nstructures protect the bacteria from host immune responses, as\nwell as antimicrobials [36]. Bacterial biofilms have been shown to\noccur in a sequential process generally involving, 1) initial\nattachment of individual cells to the surface 2) formation of\naggregates 3) further cell proliferation and biofilm maturation with\npolysaccharide formation [37]. It is possible that the aggregates\nseen in this study are due to the same processes that are important\nTable 2.

The observation that the formation of\naggregates and extracellular material was abolished in DprfA\nmutant indicates that genes within the regulon of the central\nvirulence regulator, PrfA, are involved.

The inhibition of ciliary beat frequency by\nC52, a strain in which PrfA is in a constitutively activated state\n[38,39], also indicates that expression of the PrfA regulon prior to\nexposure to the ependymal cells affects ciliary functioning. The\nabsolute requirement of PrfA for L. monocytogenes virulence has been\ndemonstrated before, as has the requirement for several genes\nwithin the PrfA regulon [21,22], but the explanation of how the\nregulon determines the effects reported here remains to be\ndetermined.\nOur future studies will focus on elucidation of the molecular\ndeterminants of the events reported.\nSupporting Information\nVideo S1 Rat brain ciliated ependymal cells after incubation in\ntissue culture medium 199 for three hours (negative control).
