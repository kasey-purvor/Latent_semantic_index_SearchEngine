By combining these seismological clues with new field evidence and numerical magma flow modelling, we propose a seismic trigger model which is based on brittle failure of magma in the glass transition. Loss of heat and gas from the magma results in a strong viscosity gradient across a dyke or conduit. This leads to a buildup of shear stress near the conduit wall where magma can rupture in a brittle manner, as field evidence from a rhyolitic dyke demonstrates. This brittle failure provides seismic energy, the majority of which is trapped in the conduit or dyke forming the lowfrequency coda of the observed seismic signal. The trigger source location marks the transition from ductile conduit flow to friction-controlled magma ascent. As the trigger mechanism is governed by the depth-dependent magma parameters, the source location remains fixed at a depth where the conditions allow brittle failure.

Introduction and background\n1.1. Low-frequency seismic earthquakes\nOne type of seismic event proved to be pivotal to\nmodern volcano seismology: the low-frequency earth-\nquake. Several examples have been quoted where these\nevents have been successfully used to forecast volcanic\neruptions (e.g. Chouet, 1996). Their occurrence alone\nhas been used as an indicative tool even though a full\nunderstanding of their source mechanism has not yet\nbeen achieved.

Neuberg).(Spanish for screw), played a major role in the heated\nscientific and public debate regarding whether lives\nwould have been saved had their occurrence been\nrecognised (Gil Cruz and Chouet, 1997).\nLow-frequency seismic events at Soufrie`ere Hills\nvolcano on Montserrat, West Indies, occupy a spectral\nrange of approximately 0.2\u201310 Hz and form a spectral\ncontinuum between the following two end-members of\nseismic event classes: the long-period earthquakes, or\nLPs for short, and so-called hybrid events. Hybrid\nevents are LPs with an additional high-frequency\nonset; however, the amount of high frequency energy\nobserved in the seismic signal on Montserrat can vary\nfrom station to station, and also at one seismic station\nfrom event to event. Therefore, LPs and hybrids on\nMontserrat are grouped together as low-frequency\nearthquakes (Neuberg, 2000). They have been observed\nat many volcanoes and are associated empirically withmal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u20135038the pressurization of the volcanic system (Lahr et al.,\n1994; Voight et al., 1998; Neuberg et al., 1998).\nLow-frequency earthquakes differ significantly from\nany other seismic signal on a volcano because, unlike\ntectonic earthquakes, they originate from a boundary\nbetween a fluid, such as magma or gas, and the solid\nsurrounding rock (e.g. Ferrazzini and Aki, 1987;\nChouet, 1988; Neuberg et al., 2000). Most of the seis-\nmic energy is trapped in the fluid-filled conduit\u2013hence\nthe term conduit resonance\u2013and only a small part (de-\npendent on the contrast of elastic parameters across the\nboundary) can escape from the conduit, propagate\nthrough the solid medium, and be recorded at a seismic\nstation. Hence, low-frequency events are interface\nwaves similar to surface waves generated by an earth-\nquake. They are dispersive, i.e., their propagation ve-\nlocity along the interface depends on their wavelength,\nthe width of the dyke or conduit, and the contrast of\nelastic parameters across the interface. Therefore, these\nare the quantities that can be determined by studying\nlow-frequency events. It is the dispersive property that\nexplains their low frequency content (Ferrazzini and\nAki, 1987).\nIn recent studies, low-frequency event modelling\nfalls into two groups: the events are modelled by a\npressure transient in a resonating crack of only a few\ncentimetres width (e.g. Chouet, 1996) or, in contrast, a\nresonating conduit section of approximately 30 m width\nand several hundred meters length, where magma prop-\nerties are depth and time-dependent (e.g. Neuberg,\n2000). No matter which of these models are used, it\nappears that this type of seismic signal provides one of\nthe few direct links between observations at the surface\nand the physical processes operating in magma-filled\nconduits and dykes. Therefore, its analysis is an essen-\ntial component in any attempt to quantify and predict\ninternal volcanic activity.\nOne exciting aspect of low-frequency seismic earth-\nquakes on Montserrat and other volcanoes is their\npotential use as a forecasting tool for volcanic erup-\ntions. On Montserrat, most major collapses of an\nandesitic lava dome are preceded by swarms of low-\nfrequency earthquakes (Miller et al., 1998). However,\nthese earthquake swarms are not always followed by a\ndome collapse. Galeras volcano in Colombia shows a\nsimilar pattern of monochromatic low-frequency earth-\nquakes that are observed before eruptions (Hellweg,\n2003). However, also at Galeras, the occurrence of\nthese events does not guarantee an eruption. This\ndemonstrates that the mere occurrence of low-frequen-\ncy earthquakes, tornillos, or LPs is not yet a reliable\nforecasting tool. Unless the actual trigger mechanism isunderstood no direct link can be made between seismo-\ngrams and the internal state of volcanic activity.\n1.2. Conduit flow models\nSeveral trigger mechanisms for low frequency events\nhave been proposed, including magma\u2013water interaction\n(Zimanowski, 1998), stick\u2013slip motion of magma plugs\nin the conduit with shear fracture (Goto, 1999), magma\nflow instabilities (Julian, 1994), and periodic release of\ngas-ash mixtures into open cracks (Molina et al., 2004).\nTwo studies at Soufrie`re Hills volcano on Montserrat\nwere based on the correlation of seismicity with tilt\ncycles observed in 1997: Denlinger and Hoblitt (1999)\nused a conceptual model of Newtonian flow of com-\npressible magma through a conduit combined with a\nstick\u2013slip condition at the conduit wall, in analogy to\nthe behaviour of industrial polymers. For a magma sup-\nply at a constant rate they obtained a cyclic behaviour of\nflow and pressure through a hysteresis in flow resistance\ncontrolled by the slip conditions at the conduit wall.\nBased on the same data set from Montserrat, Wylie\net al. (1999) explained the instability of magma flow\nthrough volatile-dependent viscosity changes. They\nobtained a cyclic flow behaviour as well, but ignored\nthe simultaneous occurrence of seismic swarms com-\npletely. More recent models by Melnik and Sparks\n(2002) are dedicated to unsteady magma flow in explo-\nsive eruptions after unloading through dome collapses.\nThe behaviour of real-time seismic amplitude measure-\nments (RSAM) has been mentioned in the same context\nbut not used in any way to constrain the flow models\n(Melnik and Sparks, 2002).\nNew field evidence for brittle failure of magma was\nfound by Tuffen et al. (2003) and fuelled new interest in\nstudies of a wide variety of phenomena including flow\nbanding, magma degassing through cracks, and also\ntriggering of low frequency events. Tuffen et al.\n(2003) suggested, for the generation of low-frequency\nearthquakes, a mechanism where stress accumulation in\na viscous magma leads to the formation of shear frac-\ntures through which a certain amount of gas and ash\nparticles can escape. Subsequent healing of these frac-\ntures results in a repeated stress build-up with minimum\nrepeat times in the order of a few tens of seconds. A\nstudy by Gonnermann and Manga (2003) focussed on\nmagma rupture once a critical stress value of 108 Pa had\nbeen reached. The emphasis of that study was to dem-\nonstrate that magma fragmentation does not inevitably\nlead to explosive volcanism. Here the simultaneous\ngeneration of volcanic earthquakes is mentioned, but\nnot incorporated, in the numerical modelling attempts.\nFig. 1. Twelve hours of a low-frequency earthquake swarm on May 19 and 20, 1997, recorded on station MBGA in Montserrat in 4 consecutive\ntime windows. Each vertical bar identifies a single event and the colour represents the family, which matches the colours in Fig. 3a.\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350 391.3. Overview\nFollowing from the investigations summarised\nabove, we focus our study on a seismic trigger mech-\nanism for low-frequency volcanic earthquakes. This is\nbased on a combination of (i) seismological constraints\nfrom Montserrat, (ii) field evidence of examples of\nbrittle failure in magmatic dykes and conduits, and\n(iii) modelling of conduit flow conditions leading to\nbrittle failure of rising magma in the glass transition.\nIn the next section we describe the characteristics of\nlow-frequency earthquakes on Montserrat and explain\nthe seismological clues one can derive from those\nobservations. In Section 3 we report the field observa-\ntions which form together with the seismological argu-\nments the framework of constraints upon which our\ntrigger model is based. Section 4 introduces the numer-\nical flow model we have employed and the two condi-\ntions necessary for the generation of low-frequency\nearthquakes: brittle failure in magma and the existence\nof a low viscosity fluid nearby to account for the\nseismic resonance. In Section 5 we present our trigger\nmodel and put it in a wider context of cyclic episodes of\nseismic swarm activity and dome growth. Finally, in\nSection 6 we compare our new model to existing\nmodels before concluding.\n2. The seismological clues\n2.1. Characteristics of low-frequency seismic events on\nMontserrat\nIn the following list we summarise some of the\ncharacteristics of low-frequency events on Montserrat,\nas well as some implications. A more detailed descrip-tion can be found in Miller et al. (1998) or Neuberg\net al. (1998).\n! Low-frequency seismic events on Montserrat have\na spectral contents of 0.2\u201310 Hz and a duration\nranging from 10 to 30 s. They have a weak\nP-wave onset and the long-period coda shows ellip-\ntical particle motion.\n! In general, low-frequency events occur in swarms\nlasting between a few hours and several days. Al-\nmost all of the large dome collapses were preceded\nby swarms of low-frequency events with identical\nwaveforms, often occurring in cycles of 8\u201312 h for\nseveral weeks. This is indicative of a re-chargeable\nsource mechanism, tapping into a limited energy\nreservoir.\n! Throughout the eruption many episodes of volcanic\ntremor have been recorded at Montserrat. These\nusually follow swarms of low-frequency earthquakes\nwith individual events becoming closer and closer\ntogether in time until they merge into tremor,\ndemonstrating the close relationship between low-\nfrequency events and this particular type of volca-\nnic tremor.\n! The occurrence of low-frequency swarms correlates\nwith tilt measurements made on the flank of the\nvolcano, which indicates that the dome inflates dur-\ning a swarm and deflates when it finishes\u2014this last\nchange is often associated with dome collapse and\npyroclastic flows (Voight et al., 1998). This strongly\nsupports the hypothesis that low-frequency events\nare linked to a pressurisation process.\n! The highly regular occurrence of seismic events has\na spectral signature of integer harmonic spectral lines\nif the time window from which the spectral slice\nFig. 2. Event family recorded in June 1997 on stationMBGA inMontserrat; (a) 19 individual events, (b) stacked trace after cross correlation and aligning\nof individual events, and (c) individual event. Note the difficulty which would be encountered in isolating the correct P-phase from this individual event.\n(d) Hypocentre location of a series of 55 events using HYPOELLIPSE and a 3-layer velocity model; (e) hypocentral estimates for the same series of\n55 events using VELESTwhere simultaneously a 3-layer velocitymodel is estimated. The average rms residual of the events is 0.013 s or one sample at\n75 Hz, translating toF40 m. The source locations cluster within a constant velocity zone and are approximately 500 m from any velocity boundary.\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u20135040computed is wide enough to cover several events.\nShifting dominant frequencies which have been ob-\nserved on many other volcanoes indicate the change\nof magma properties within a few tens of seconds\n(Powell and Neuberg, 2003).\n! For most swarms the individual low-frequency\nearthquakes are very similar to each other in both\namplitude and waveform, having cross-correlation\ncoefficients as high as 0.9F0.1. During a swarm,\nevents can occur at very regular intervals, with thetime between consecutive events varying by less\nthan 2% for several hours on end (White et al.,\n1998). This points to a stable, non-destructive source\nmechanism.\n2.2. Identifications of families in earthquake swarms\nWhen looking at a low-frequency earthquake swarm\nas depicted in Fig. 1 it is not always obvious that many\nsingle low-frequency events show some similarity. By\nFig. 3. (a) Families as shown in Fig. 1 together with tilt (solid line) and its time derivative (dashed line), both low-pass filtered. (b) Waveform\nfamilies compared to the tilt record over the 6 days between June 23 and June 28, 1997. Note that different families represent different source\nlocations: the oblongs represent the families, with different shades and patterns distinguishing between the different waveform groups A to G. The\nstart of the oblong is positioned where the first event of that family occurs in that swarm and the end coincides with the last event. The dome\ncollapse occurred at approximately 12:45 on June 25, 1997.\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350 41using cross-correlation methods, however, we found that\nup to 70% of all events fall into one of several different\ndfamiliesT of similar waveforms (Green and Neuberg,\n2006-this issue). The similarity has been defined through\na correlation coefficient of 0.70 and higher and the entire\nwaveform seen in a time window of 8 s has been used to\ncompute the cross-correlation. Each family represents a\nset of events which have been produced within a small\nsource volume from which the energy has been radiated\nalong an identical path to the receiver. The remaining\n30% of low-frequency events do not show any similarity\nand must be interpreted as signals originating from dif-\nferent non-stationary sources. Families can be consistent\nregarding their waveform over several days, i.e. the\nsource location and mechanism is stable and can be\nreactivated again and again.2.3. Quantifying the similarity in waveform and source\nlocation\nWe have performed numerical tests employing a\nfinite difference method similar to that used in Neuberg\n(2000) where we use a simple Ku\u00a8epper wavelet with\nthe dominant frequency of 1 Hz to kick start a conduit\nresonance. This trigger wavelet represents an explosion\ninside the fluid-filled conduit which is embedded in a\nsolid. By varying the location of the trigger and cross-\ncorrelating the resulting synthetic signals we get an idea\nof the range across which the position of the source\nlocation can vary before similarity breaks down. As-\nsuming an average acoustic velocity inside the conduit\nof 1200 m s\u00021, we determine this range to be less than\n120 m. This is significantly smaller than predicted by\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u20135042the quarter-wavelength hypothesis applicable for gen-\neral seismic body waves (Geller and Mueller, 1980).\nThe onset of low-frequency events is generally very\nweak and classic location techniques using the P and\nS-phases do not work well. However, a much better\nabsolute earthquake location can be achieved by using\nthe following steps: (i) stack all members of one family\nafter aligning the signals according to maximum cross-\ncorrelation, (ii) find the P-wave onset for the stacked\ndmaster eventT, (iii) use this P-wave pick for individual\nevents, and (iv) repeat the procedure for each station\nand use a classic P-wave travel time method to find the\nsource location. This method uses the fact that a trigger\nsignal at a fixed source location produces exactly the\nsame resonance, which controls the long-period coda of\nthe low-frequency events. This coda, in turn, dominates\nthe cross-correlation. Fig. 2 shows the results for two\ndifferent location methods: (i) using the standard Mon-\ntserrat velocity model, and (ii) by determining the\nvelocity model at the same time. The locations of all\nfamilies fall into the narrow range of 500F100 m\nbelow sea level, i.e. approximately 1500 m below the\nactive dome surface. Each family forms a narrow clus-\nter without showing any significant structure. These\nresults are in good accordance with Rowe et al. (2004).\n2.4. Correlation between earthquake swarms and tilt\ncycles\nVoight et al. (1998) pointed out that a radial tilt\nsignal recorded in 1997 on Chances Peak, an old\ndome adjacent to the active lava dome, correlated\nwith the seismicity of Soufrie`re Hills volcano. A\nmuch more detailed picture emerges when only the\nlow-frequency earthquake families are plotted together\nwith the tilt signal and its time derivative (Fig. 3).\nSeismic activity commences when the tilt goes through\na turning point, or its derivative reaches a maximum.\nFurthermore, low-frequency seismicity ceases when the\ntilt goes through a second turning point, i.e. its deriv-\native reaches a minimum. Tilt, the rigid rotation of the\nvolcano\u2019s flank, is a manifestation of pressure changes\nreaching the shallow (b1000 m) part of the plumbing\nsystem. We observe a very good match between the\nswitching on and off of seismicity and the turning\npoints in the tilt signal, which points to magma move-\nment at depth: as soon as pressurisation has reached a\ncertain threshold, magma starts to move, depressurising\nthe system, and causing the tilt behaviour to turn. As\nsoon as the magma has stopped the system begins to\nbuild up pressure due to the diffusive growth of gas\nbubbles.The seismic sources are extremely stable and do not\nevolve significantly through several tilt cycles, or even\nthrough a major dome collapse (Fig. 3b). This places\nconstraints on the location and mechanism for low-\nfrequency seismicity. In particular, the repeatability of\nthe patterns of waveform families between swarms\nindicates that the mechanism for shallow pressurisation\nis extremely well ordered with different seismic sources\nbeing reactivated in the same manner for each defor-\nmation cycle. After the dome collapse pressure condi-\ntions in the conduit have changed, and the sources most\nactive prior to the collapse pause while a subset of\nfamilies, previously showing minor activity, now dom-\ninates the generation of seismic energy. After a few\ncycles the system has recovered and the former source\nlocations are again active. This observation will be\nessential for our trigger model described below.\n2.5. Summary of seismological constraints\nA low-frequency seismic signal on Montserrat com-\nprises a trigger part at the high frequency onset and a\nresonance section forming the low-frequency coda. In\nevents with high amplitudes a clear P-wave can be\nidentified at the onset, which is followed immediately\nby interface waves with elliptical particle motions (e.g.\nNeuberg et al., 2000; Jousset et al., 2003). These events\noften occur in swarms comprising a limited number of\nfamilies with distinct waveforms. Events with identical\nwaveforms originate from identical source locations.\nTherefore, the existence of event families demonstrates\nthat there is a number of fixed sources at about 500 m\ndepth below sea level (1500 m below the dome) with a\nrepetitive mechanism. In the case of single events\nmerging into tremor the repeat time is as short as a\nfraction of a second. The correlation of low-frequency\nseismicity with inflation and deflation cycles reveals the\nrole of low-frequency earthquakes as an indicator of\nmagma movement and depressurisation. Furthermore,\nif pressure conditions change, the waveform and,\nhence, the seismic source locations change as well\n(Fig. 3b). This indicates a pressure dependent parameter\nwindow in which the trigger mechanism can act.\n3. Field evidence for brittle failure in magma\nField evidence for a potential trigger mechanism for\nlow-frequency earthquakes was recently discovered in\ndissected rhyolitic conduits at Torfajo\u00a8kull in Iceland\n(Tuffen et al., 2003; Tuffen and Dingwell, 2004). A\nsummary of the new evidence, its implications for low-\nfrequency trigger mechanisms, and its applicability to\nFig. 4. (a) Part of a network of irregular fractures in obsidian at Skridugil Conduit, Raudufossafjo\u00a8ll, Iceland. The fault network (f) is filled with pale\ngrey fragmented material, which locally exhibits bedding (indicated). An earlier healed fault zone has an apparent offset of 2 cm where cut by a\nfracture. Modified from Tuffen and Dingwell (2004). (b) Photomicrograph of a fault zone within obsidian. The zone is between 1 and 2 mm thick\nand filled with cataclasite (pale grey, labelled c) and ultracataclasite (dark grey, labelled u), which have the same composition as the surrounding\nobsidian (o). The arrow indicates where an obsidian clast within the cataclasite (near-white) is cut by a small fracture, indicating in-situ grain size\nreduction. Modified from Tuffen and Dingwell (2004).\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350 43Montserrat is given in this section. The dyke-like con-\nduits, which fed small-volume lava flows, have widths\nof 10\u201320 m and are dissected to a depth of about 40 m.\nComplex brittle\u2013ductile textures in the low-vesicularity\nconduit-filling obsidian record repeated fracture and\nhealing of magma during ascent.\n3.1. Fracture and faulting of highly viscous magma in\nconduits\nIn the Torfajo\u00a8kull case, networks of angular frac-\ntures, which have typical lengths of 0.1\u20132 m and aper-\ntures of 1\u201380 mm, cut the obsidian close to the conduit\nwalls. They consist of shear fractures with displace-\nments of several millimetres to centimetres, smaller\ntensile fractures which propagate from the walls of\nshear fractures, and irregular voids. The fractures are\nfilled with fine-grained fragments of obsidian and bro-\nken phenocrysts with an identical composition to thesurrounding obsidian. These fragments are formed by\nabrasion of fracture surfaces. There are complex sedi-\nmentary structures in the fragmented material, includ-\ning cross-bedding and erosional surfaces (Fig. 4a). Beds\nrange from 1 to 5 mm in thickness and are poorly to\nwell sorted. Locally, beds can be traced from shear\nfractures into tensile fractures and voids, where their\nthickness greatly increases. Sedimentary structures in\nthe fragmented material indicate that it was transported\nthrough the fracture systems by gas released from\nvesicles and pore space intersected by fractures. As\nargued in Tuffen et al. (2003), the seismic energy\nreleased during formation of such fractures is consis-\ntent with recorded low-frequency earthquakes at Mon-\ntserrat and elsewhere. The occasional occurrence of\npumice clasts in fractures cutting low-vesicularity\nmagma of the conduit walls indicates lateral transport\nof gas and ash from the conduit interior. Similar\nbedded material is found in tuffisite veins that cut\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u20135044the country rock and infilling lava of conduits else-\nwhere (e.g. Stasiuk et al., 1996), and demonstrates\nthat magma fracture can play an important role in\ndegassing within ascending magma (Jaupart, 1998;\nGonnermann and Manga, 2003).\nAs described in Tuffen and Dingwell (2004), frac-\nture networks develop through coalescence and rotation\ninto near-planar fault zones during subsequent upward\nflow of magma. Fault zones are near-vertical, up to 5 m\nin length, 1\u201350 mm thick, and have maximum mea-\nsured shear displacements of 13 cm. The fragmented\nmaterial within fault zones resembles that in the initial\nfracture networks, but has been modified by repeated\nfriction-controlled slip events with the grinding of\ngrains in localised slip bands. Textural associations\nclosely resemble seismogenic tectonic faults as de-\nscribed by Chester and Chester (1998) and others. It\nis therefore likely that movement of each fault zone\ngenerated a number of similar seismic events (Tuffen\nand Dingwell, 2004).\nSome fault zones have undergone an additional\nphase of healing and distributed ductile deformation,\nin which the fragmented material is thoroughly\nwelded and eventually forms flow bands in the ob-\nsidian (Tuffen et al., 2003; Tuffen and Dingwell,\n2004). Healing, which is mediated by frictional heat-\ning and\/or reduced strain rate, leads to aseismic vis-\ncous deformation. In this way, seismogenic fractures\nand faults in magma may develop and heal during\nconduit flow.\n4. Modelling of magma flow in brittle conditions\nThe fracture networks are thought to be formed by\nshear failure of high viscosity magma in the glass\ntransition (Tuffen et al., 2003). When the product of\nshear strain rate and shear viscosity exceeds a critical\nvalue (approximately 107 Pa), deformation becomes\nunrelaxed and shear stress accumulation eventually\nleads to failure (Dingwell and Webb, 1989). In this\nsection we consider a combination of high melt viscos-\nity and strain rate that is necessary for failure to be\nachieved during conduit flow of silicic magma.\n4.1. The viscosity problem\nLow-frequency earthquakes consist of an onset\nwhich sometimes has high-frequency spectral compo-\nnents, and a low-frequency resonance coda produced by\nseismic energy that has been efficiently trapped in a\nfluid-filled part of the volcanic plumbing system. This\nposes a problem, which in turn will provide an impor-tant constraint for the following magma flow modelling\nattempts: if brittle failure of magma provides the trigger\nmechanism that sets off conduit resonance, then the\nmelt must be viscous enough to allow the critical stress\nvalue to be exceeded, on the other hand the magma\nviscosity must be low enough to support seismic con-\nduit resonance with low damping. This problem can be\nsolved by considering high viscosity gradients across\nthe conduit controlled by high gradients in temperature\nand gas content. Another option to reach the critical\nshear stress while maintaining a low viscosity is to\nconsider high flow velocity gradients or strain rates as\nproduced by e.g. geometry changes in the plumbing\nsystem with depth.\n4.2. The critical shear stress\nIn this section we employ a finite element method to\ncompute 2D magma flow in a dyke or conduit leading\nto rupture conditions. The aim is to study the interaction\nof governing parameters and, particularly, to identify\nlocations in the conduit or dyke where the critical shear\nstress is exceeded resulting in brittle failure of the\nmagma and, consequently, the triggering of low-fre-\nquency seismic signals. Similar to Gonnermann and\nManga (2003) we solve the compressible Navier-Stokes\nequation for a mixture of gas, melt and crystals ascend-\ning at the same rate, however, we neglect crystal growth\nduring ascent. Dimensions of the conduit\/dyke are\n30 m\u00035000 m and the magma chamber depth is at\n5000 m (Barclay et al., 1998), the pressure in the\nmagma chamber is given by the lithostatic country\nrock pressure plus an excess pressure, Pex. We include\nwater solubility using Henry\u2019s Solubility Law (Burn-\nham, 1975), and assume an ideal gas and constant\nbubble number density. As explained below (Section\n5.1) the critical shear stress is reached at 830 m depth.\nTherefore, we include horizontal gas loss through per-\nmeable magma and through the conduit wall (Jaupart\nand Alle`gre, 1991; Jaupart, 1998), once a plug has\nformed at 830 m. We use a constant magma supply\nwhich is controlled by the boundary conditions for the\nexcess pressure, Pex, and no-slip boundary conditions at\nthe conduit wall. However, at 830 m depth we change\nthe boundary conditions at the conduit walls to friction-\ncontrolled slip, simulating the transition of the flow\nfrom a ductile to a friction-controlled mechanism.\nBoundary conditions for velocity and pressure at the\nexit are u=0 and P=1\u0003105 Pa (atmospheric pressure),\nrespectively. The viscosity of the melt is given by Hess\nand Dingwell (1996), the volume viscosity of the\nmagma is adopted from Prud\u2019Homme and Bird\nJ.W.

(4)) 0.5 m from the conduit wall is plotted in Fig. 5c\nand its cross-section from conduit centre to wall at this\ndepth in Fig. 6.\n5. The model: Fracture of magma as a seismic\ntrigger\n5.1. The conceptual model\nWe propose a conceptual model for the generation of\nlow frequency seismic events which is based on rupture\nof magma in the glass transition where the shear stressexceeds a critical value as in Goto (1999). This con-\nceptual model is summarised in Fig. 7. Through magma\nflow modelling we explored the parameter space in\nwhich melt viscosity and strain rate determine where\nthese conditions occur. As depicted in Fig. 6, the brittle\nfailure ratio increases with the ascending magma and\nreaches the critical value of 1 near the conduit wall at a\ndepth of 830 m. At this depth we change boundary\nconditions from no-slip to friction-controlled slip to\nenable the magma to ascend further by plug flow. In\nsuch a way, the trigger position indicated by the model\nremains at the same depth, as suggested by the seismic\nobservations.\nFig. 6. Brittle failure ration as defined in Eq. (4) between conduit\ncentre and conduit wall. Note that failure occurs near the conduit wall\nwhere ratio exceeds 1; magma ascends above this depth as a plug\nunder friction-controlled conditions.\nFig. 7. A schematic cartoon illustrating the formation of shear frac\ntures and their subsequent evolution into faults within a seismogenic\nwindow. Once formed the fractures move up due to the ascent o\nmagma allowing friction-controlled plug flow to form. The opening o\nthe fractures allows increased gas loss to the surroundings. The\ntransition from seismogenic slip to aseismic plug flow may be due\nto frictional heating, as discussed in Section 3.1.\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350 47However, the depth at which critical stress condi-\ntions are reached does not match the depth determined\nseismically in Section 2. Left unconstrained, the depth\nat which the critical conditions for magma rupture\noccur can vary within a certain range due to trade-\noffs between several model parameters. Using the loca-\ntions of seismic sources as a constraint we can choose\nthe parameters in the flow models accordingly and\nforce the depth to 1500 m.\nThis could be easily achieved by lowering the crit-\nical shear stress value to 106 Pa. Here further experi-\nmental results are necessary to test if the inclusion of\ngas bubbles and crystals could lower the critical shear\nstress to such an extent (Spieler et al., 2004). Alterna-\ntively, deviations in conduit geometry such as dbottle\nnecksT or the transition from a dyke to a cylindrical\ngeometry could easily lead to an increase in magma\nflow rate, pushing the strain rate over the critical edge.\nAn increase in magma flow rate to a metre per second\nrather than centimetres per second would be necessary.However, since certain magma processes such as crys-\ntallisation during magma ascent and vertical degassing\nare not yet part of the flow model, we refrain from\nforcing the model to match the seismically obtained\ndepth and leave the parameters in an average range as\nlisted in Table 1. Hence, we suggest a conceptual rather\nthan quantitative model which, nevertheless, can ex-\nplain the trigger mechanism for low-frequency events.\nAn additional and even stronger argument for the\npressure- and, therefore, depth-dependence of a critical\ntrigger region can be derived from the change in source\nlocations of low-frequency earthquakes after a dome\ncollapse as depicted in Fig. 3b. Right after the dome\ncollapse and accompanying depressurisation a different\nsubset of families (from different source locations)\nprovide the observed seismic energy as described in\nSection 2.4. After several cycles the pressure has\nreached its former level and the same sources are active\nas before the collapse.\n5.2. Trigger and resonance\nSo far we have concentrated on the actual trigger\nmechanism that sets off any elastic wave. In order to\nproduce a low-frequency earthquake in a volcanic ed-\nifice a resonator needs to capture the seismic energy\nand trap it efficiently through a high impedance contrast\nbetween resonating container and surrounding country\nrock. It is not necessary for the trigger and resonance to\nbe at the same location. Kumagai and Chouet (1999)-\nf\nf\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u20135048and Molina et al. (2004), suggest an ash-laden gas\nemission into an open crack, which acts then as a\nresonator. In our modelling framework we suggest a\nmagma-filled dyke or conduit in close vicinity of the\nbrittle fracture such that seismic energy released by the\ntrigger mechanism can propagate to the resonator where\nit will be trapped through the high impedance contrast.\nA critical issue here is the damping which the seismic\nwaves encounter traveling from the trigger location to\nthe resonator, and then within the resonator. Collier et\nal. (2006-this issue) investigate the seismic damping\nissue in magma, particularly the impact of gas bubbles\non damping in different frequency ranges. Their study\ntakes diffusion and gas mass flux in and out of bubbles\ninto account and demonstrates that the bubble nucle-\nation level where diffusion is very effective acts as an\nefficient damping body. The results of this study sug-\ngest that the resonating parts (dykes or conduits) of the\nplumbing system on Montserrat are between the bubble\nnucleation level (at approximately 3500 m) and trigger\nlevel (at 1500 m) where conditions are such to allow\nconduit resonance without strong damping.\n5.3. The model in a wider context\nLow-frequency events very often occur in swarms\nwith variable duration (e.g. Miller et al., 1998; White et\nal., 1998) and sometimes exhibit a regular excitation\npattern which results in the observation of harmonic\nspectral lines (Powell and Neuberg, 2003). Seen in a\nwider context, our trigger model fits those earlier stud-\nies where the periodicity of earthquake swarms (and tilt\ncycles) is linked to the diffusion processes that dictate\nthe supply rate of magma from a deeper reservoir once\na magma plug has started to move and local pressure\nhas begun to drop (e.g. Melnik and Sparks, 1999).\nHence, the occurrence of low-frequency earthquake\nswarms indicates magma movement at depth which\nresults in local depressurisation of the volcanic system\nbelow that depth.\nThe occurrence of harmonic spectral lines have been\nassociated with a potential feed-back mechanism to\nexplain the precise periodicity of the signal (Neuberg,\n2000). The resonant part of a low-frequency earthquake\nforms spatially periodic pressure variations within the\nmagma column. If this pressure variation is superim-\nposed onto the local shear stress that is caused by\nviscous magma flow, the critical level for magma rup-\nture is reached and another low-frequency earthquake is\ntriggered. This earthquake results in further excitation\nof the conduit resonance and a feed-back system can be\nestablished until magma supply lags behind.6. Discussion and conclusions\nThe field evidence for flow of gas\/ash through a\ncrack is also consistent with aspects of the crack reso-\nnance model, as developed and discussed by Chouet\n(1988), Kumagai and Chouet (1999), and Molina et al.\n(2004). Indeed, correlation between ash emission from\ndomes and shallow seismic events at Santa Maria and\nGaleras lava domes indicates that release of gas and ash\nmay be related to the seismic trigger mechanism. One\nproblem is that the crack sizes required to produce the\nfrequency content of measured low-frequency events\nare up to 100 times larger than the fracture networks\nobserved by Tuffen et al. (2003). If earthquakes are\ntriggered in conduits, the existence of cracks extending\nhundreds of metres into the country rock is geologically\nunfeasible. Despite this problem, Molina et al. (2004)\nsuggest that changing amplitude decay of LP events\nduring a swarm at Tungurahua, Ecuador can be pro-\nduced by resonance of a crack that is gradually filling\nwith ash. Per Collier et al. (2006-this issue) we suggest\nthat a change in the damping properties of gas-charged\nmagma could easily be achieved by slight pressure\nchanges resulting in subsequent changes of gas-volume\nfraction.\nPossible criticism of linking a trigger model for\nSoufrie`re Hills Volcano to field observations from an\nancient rhyolitic conduit in Iceland could stem from\nuncertainty about whether similar fracture and faulting\nprocesses can occur in more crystal-rich or vesicular\nmagma. However, two lines of evidence suggest that\nthe model is indeed appropriate. Firstly, the conditions\nfor shear fracture of magma are likely to be met during\neruptions of crystalline andesite and dacite, as well as\ncrystal-poor rhyolite (Goto, 1999; Gonnermann and\nManga, 2003; Tuffen et al., 2003). Secondly, there is\ntextural evidence for mixed brittleductile behaviour (i.e.\nfracture and healing) within many (recently) active lava\ndomes, including Soufrie`re Hills Volcano, Unzen and\nLascar (e.g. Sparks, 1997; Smith et al., 2001). It is\ntherefore likely that shear fracture and faulting of\nmagma play an important role in triggering seismicity\nand allowing gas escape at Montserrat and elsewhere.\nIn conclusion, we base the proposed trigger model\non the following pieces of evidence:\n! Low-frequency earthquake swarms occur in groups\nwith similar waveforms indicating a stationary\nsource location over a period of several days, as\nwell as a repetitive source mechanism.\n! These low-frequency seismic sources are located at a\nnarrow depth range of 500F100 m below sea level\nJ.W. Neuberg et al. \/ Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 153 (2006) 37\u201350 49or approximately 1500F100 m below the active\nlava dome.\n! Magma flow modelling predicts a critical shear\nstress to be reached at 830 m where magma para-\nmeters are chosen in an average range that reflects\nrealistic conditions for Soufrie`re Hills volcano on\nMontserrat.\n! To increase the modelled critical depth of 830 m to\nmatch the seismically determined depth of 1500 m, a\nshear stress as low as 106 Pa would be required.\n! Field studies from Iceland provide evidence of shear\nfracture and faulting of magma.\nThe characteristics of the trigger model for low-\nfrequency events can be summarised as follows:\n! Conditions under which magma ruptures can be met at\na depth where the product of melt viscosity and shear\nstrain rate exceeds a critical value. This value is exper-\nimentally determined for pure glass to be 107\u2013108 Pa.\n! Shear cracks open at this depth and are taken up-\nwards by the ascending magma. At this stage magma\nflow switches from ductile to a friction controlled\nregime. These cracks of the dimension of a few\nmetres allow increased degassing and clog up by\nthe deposition of ash.\n! While magma ascends, the source depth remains\nconstant where conditions for magma rupture are\nmet. This provides repeatability of the source mech-\nanism shorter than the time span needed for healing\nof the cracks.\n! The seismic energy released is trapped in the part of\nthe conduit where magma has a high impedance\ncontrast to the surrounding country rock. The viscos-\nity in this part must be low enough to prevent atten-\nuation. This leads to conduit resonance providing the\nlow-frequency character of the seismic signal.\nFuture work will focus on the amplitudes and seismic\nmoments of low-frequency events in order to quantify\nmagma motion at depth. Further magma flow models\nwill help to explore the model space of magma para-\nmeters to gain a better insight into the physical processes\nrelated to degassing and viscosity changes at depth.\nExperimental work on glass with vesicles and crystals\nis required to determine the conditions under which gas-\ncharged magma will fracture.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by a University of Leeds\nResearch Scholarship, a NERC PhD studentship (NER\/S\/A\/2002\/10478), and by MULTIMO (EVGICT- 2000-\n0021) which is supported by the Environmental and\nSustainable Development Program of the European\nCommission Research Directorate General.
