Exceptionally well-preserved specimens of a new cypridid ostracod \n(Crustacea), Raepula ira sp. nov., are described from palaeolake sediments of the \nMiddle Miocene Barstow Formation of the Mud Hills, southern California. This is only \nthe second occurrence of exceptionally preserved ostracods from the Miocene. \nBased on ages obtained from associated volcanic tuffs the palaeolake sediments \nwere deposited between 16.3 and 15.8 Ma. The ostracods form one element of a \ndiverse lake community dominated by fairy shrimps, copepods, diatoms, larvae of \ndiving beetles, flies and mosquitoes, and body fossils and ephippia of branchiopods \nand anomopods. The ostracods are preserved three-dimensionally with their soft \nanatomy replicated in microcrystalline silica. Sub-micron scale details such as \nsensory setae are preserved, surpassing the resolution of most other ostracod-\nbearing lagerst\u00e4tten and allowing their biology to be compared with extant taxa.  \nKey words: Ostracoda, Miocene, morphology, taphonomy, California \nSupplementary material: Red-blue anaglyphs of the exceptionally preserved \nostracods are available at http:\/\/www.geolsoc.org.uk\/SUP00000.  \n  2\nOf the estimated 30,000 species of fossil ostracods only about 20 species are \nknown from their soft anatomy. Rare mummified Quaternary ostracods have \nbeen recorded (e.g. Schmidt & Sellman 1966; Horne et al., 1990) and records \nof soft-parts from older geological deposits extend back to the Palaeozoic \n(see Smith 2000; Siveter et al. 2003, 2007; Siveter 2008). Most are of marine \nostracods (e.g. Siveter et al. 2003, 2007), although exceptionally preserved \nnon-marine ostracods have been reported, for example from Eocene Baltic \namber (Keyser & Weitschat 2005) and from lake sediments of the Middle \nMiocene of the Antarctic (Williams et al. 2008a; Lewis et al. 2008). The \ntaxonomy of living freshwater ostracods is based principally on soft-part \nanatomy such as appendages and genitalia, with shell morphology taking a \nsecondary role.  Rare occurrences of soft anatomy preservation in the fossil \nrecord are an important way of testing whether shell-based taxonomies are \nrealistic (see Siveter 2008; Williams et al. 2008b, for discussion of this \nproblem). Here we report a new exceptionally preserved ostracod fauna from \nMiddle Miocene palaeolake sediments of southern California (Fig. 1).  \n \nNeogene freshwater ostracods from southwest USA \nOstracod faunas from Neogene palaeolakes are widely documented from the \nsouthwest part of the USA (e.g. Swain et al. 1971), but studies have largely \nfocussed on taxonomic appraisal of shell material, rather than on \ninterpretation of the palaeoenvironmental significance of the faunas: none of \nthese deposits have yielded ostracods with soft anatomy. These palaeolake \nsuccessions yield faunas of about 20 ostracod species (e.g. Swain 1987, \n1990; Swain & Wagoner 1979, 1985), although diversity in any single sample \n  3\nis between two and ten species. More than 40 ostracod species have been \ndescribed from the Oligocene and Miocene Indian Well and Humboldt \nformations of north-eastern Nevada (Swain 1986). A succession of Miocene \nthrough Holocene freshwater ostracod faunas has been recognised in the \nColorado Plateau and Great Basin (Swain and Wagoner, 1985), where the \nEarly and Middle Miocene is characterised by species of Tuberocypris and \nHeterocypris.  \n \nThe Barstow Konservat Lagerst\u00e4tte \nThe Middle Miocene Barstow Formation of California is an approximately \n1000m thick succession of lacustrine and fluviatile deposits divided into the \nlower Owl Conglomerate Member and the informal \u2018Middle\u2019 and \u2018Upper\u2019 \nmembers (Woodburne et al. 1990) (Fig. 2). Ostracods with preserved soft \nanatomy occur in the \u2018Middle\u2019 Member (ca 570 m thick), which comprises grey \nand green-grey fluviatile conglomerates and conglomeritic sandstones that \npass laterally eastwards into low energy sandstones and lacustrine grey and \ngreen-grey mudstones with infrequent limestone and concretion horizons.  \nA number of volcanic tuff horizons distributed throughout the formation \nhave provided a basis for geochronology (Woodburne et al. 1990). The base \nof the \u2018Middle\u2019 Member is locally defined by the Rak Tuff (16.3+\/-0.3 Ma). The \nconcretions that bear ostracods with soft tissues occur 62.5m above the Rak \nTuff, and approximately half way between it and the Oreodont Tuff (15.8+\/-0.3 \nMa). The silicified ostracods therefore probably date to the latest Burdigalian, \nalthough an earliest Langhian age cannot be ruled out (= Hemingfordian \nStage of local American usage). \n  4\nThe microfauna of the Barstow Konservat Lagerst\u00e4tte has yielded \nthree-dimensionally preserved insects including diving beetle larvae \n(Schistomerus californensis), flies (Dasyhelea australis antiqua and \nCulicoides), mosquitos (Anopheles), midges, thrips and wasps \n(Hymenoptera), together with abundant fairy shrimps (Anostraca), wolf \nspiders (Lycosidae), copepods, diatoms (Craticula, Dimidiata, Amphora, \nNitzschia and Anomoeoneis) and body fossils and ephippia of zooplankton \nsuch as Branchiopoda and Anomopoda (Palmer & Bassett 1954; Palmer, \n1957; Park 1995; Belk & Schram 2001; Park & Downing 2001; Miller & Lubkin \n2001; Leggitt 2003, 2005, 2006; unpublished data). During the history of the \nlake, the faunal composition and insect diversity changed significantly, \nprobably due to differences in water chemistry, a shift of the shoreline due to \nshallowing and increased aridity (Park & Downing 2001).   \nWithin the \u2018Middle\u2019 Member several stratigraphical levels yield \ncarbonate concretions (Park, 1995, Park & Downing, 2001). The ostracods \nreported here are from a single horizon of concretions at a site 17km north of \nBarstow in the \"Rainbow Basin Canyon\" in the Mud Hills, (grid reference \nNorth 35.023716 West 117.040819; Fig. 1). This locality is near to the type \nsection of the Barstow Formation.  The concretions yielded an ostracod fauna \nof one or possibly two species; the possible second species is known from \nonly very rare and poorly preserved specimens. The ostracod diversity of the \nconcretion horizon from palaeolake Barstow is, therefore, similar to other \nNeogene samples from the American Southwest. \n \n  5\nThe palaeoenvironment of Lake Barstow \nBoth the palaeontological and sedimentological evidence indicate that Lake \nBarstow was a shallow, poorly-mixed, saline-alkaline lake in a warm \ntemperate environment (Park & Downing 2001). The concretion-bearing \nsediments contain zeolites, borates, sulphates and low-Mg calcite, and are \nassociated with evaporite beds and diatomites. The brine pathways \npostulated for these concretion-bearing deposits indicate high salinity and \ndysaerobic conditions (Park 1995). The presence of fairy shrimp, midges, \ndiatoms and ostracods is consistent with this palaeoenvironmental \ninterpretation. Fairy shrimp are restricted to environments lacking endemic \npredators, such as vernal pools or alkaline lakes (Pennak 1989); they are not \nknown from waters with pH below 6.8 and some species may withstand up to \npH 9.5. Fairy shrimp require a minimum salinity of 3% NaCl, and may \nwithstand extremely high salinities (Ward 1992). Though the juvenile stages of \nthe biting midge Dasyhelea favour saline environments, they can only tolerate \nsalinities below 14% NaCl (Ward 1992). Likewise, presence of the diatoms \nCraticula halophila and Dimidiata saccula suggest a saline-alkaline lake \nenvironment (Hajos 1974; European diatom dataset 1996). A poorly-mixed, \nshallow lake environment is in accord with the presence of biting midges and \nostracods (Pennak 1989), and the presence of non-biting midges is consistent \nwith low oxygenation. Changes in faunal composition, sedimentology and \nisotopic data all indicate an increase in aridity and evaporation during the time \nin which the concretion bearing horizons were deposited (Park 1995; Park & \nDowning 2001); the widespread gypsum deposits overlying the youngest \n  6\nconcretion horizon in the Calico Mountains indicate the onset of more \ndominantly playa lake conditions.  \nLake Barstow was probably ecologically similar to the Recent saline-\nalkaline lakes of the western United States (Park & Downing 2001), such as \nMono Lake (California), Big Soda Lake (Nevada) and Soap Lake \n(Washington), and the lateral continuity of lake sediments is more consistent \nwith a permanent lake rather than a vernal pool (Park 1995). The \nallochthonous fauna and flora suggest the area surrounding the lake was \ndominated by grassland (Euscelis, Miogonates, etc.) with small, scattered \npatches of woodland (indicated by the termite Cybocelus) located in a \nCalifornia slightly cooler and wetter than the present day (Park & Downing \n2001). Tufas and volcanic rocks occur in adjacent coeval deposits, and the \npresence of borates in the lake deposits indicates both a hydrothermal and \nvolcanic influence on lake chemistry (Park 1995; Park & Downing 2001; Smith \n& Medrano 1996). Considering this, and that the lake formed at a time of \nactive tectonic extension (Woodburne et al. 1990), the lakes of the East \nAfrican Rift Valley may also provide a good analogue for the geological \nsetting. \nThe ecological requirements of Raepula ira gen. et sp. nov. are difficult \nto determine without recourse to the associated fauna and sediments, \nbecause the Family Cyprididae occupies a variety of mileux, including \ntemporary water bodies, and tolerates a broad spectrum of salinities, \nalkalinities and oxygen content. Based on the palaeoenvironmental setting \nand associated biota, Raepula ira was probably polythermophilic and \nrheophobic (sensu Meisch, 2000), and occupied permanent saline-alkaline \n  7\nlakes, in shallow, poorly mixed, dysaerobic waters, with a salinity between 3 \nand 14% NaCl and a pH greater than 6.8. \n \nSystematic Palaeontology \nFigured specimens prefixed OUMNH are deposited in the University of Oxford \nMuseum of Natural History, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PW and those prefixed \nLACMIP have been placed in the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural \nHistory, 900 Exposition Blvd., Los Angeles CA 90007. \n \nClass Ostracoda Latreille, 1806  \nOrder Podocopida Sars 1866 \nSuborder Cypridocopina Jones 1901 \nSuperfamily Cypridoidea Baird 1845 \nFamily Cyprididae Baird, 1845 \nSubfamily Eucypridinae Bronstein, 1947  \nGenus Raepula gen. nov. \nType species: Raepula ira gen. et sp. nov.  \nDerivation of name: Latin, rarus (rare) + epula (a feast); alluding to the \nscarcity of ostracod fossils with preserved soft-parts; and ira (rainbow), \nreferring to the type locality. Gender, feminine. \nDiagnosis:  Carapace laterally elongate and sub-reniform with seven elongate \nadductor muscle scars. First antenna large, with a sub-rectangular basipod \nand six podomeres. Second antenna has an endopod comprising three \npodomeres and a tiny, slender exopod. The first podomere bears a \u2018baseball \nbat' shaped aesthetasc.  \n  8\nMandible has a large elongate sub-triangular coxa and an endopod \ncomprising three podomeres. First maxilla has a large basipod; an endopod \nwith one long and one short podomere; three curved endites; and a crescent-\nshaped branchial plate bearing at least eleven marginal setae. Second maxilla \nhas an endite with at least ten distal setae and a tapered endopod terminating \nin possibly three setae in the female and a hook in the male. Sixth appendage \nhas a large, curved basipod geniculate with a ramus consisting of four \npodomeres, the fourth having two stout apical setae and terminating in a large \ncurved claw. Seventh appendage consists of a basipod and ramus with three \npodomeres, the terminal one bearing a small pincer organ and two elongate \nsetae. Furca consists of a proximally fused pair of un-segmented rami, each \nwith two large distal claws. \nRemarks: The \u2018baseball bat\u2019 morphology of the aesthetasc on the second \nantenna supports the assignment of Raepula to the Cypridoidea, its \nmorphology being an apomorphy for Cypridocopina (Kaji and Tsukagoshi, \n2008). Raepula has a smooth carapace; it lacks a distal triangle on the furca; \nthe posterior seta of the furca is relatively close to the base of the terminal \nclaw; and the basal segments of the 6th appendage bears two setae. Raepula \nis therefore placed in Subfamily Eucypridinae. The distal podomere of the \nmaxillula is not elongate, but about as broad as it is long and the natatory \nsetae on the second antenna are well developed, reaching beyond the tip of \nthe terminal claw. Raepula therefore resembles Trajancypris, but differs in \nhaving a sub-reniform rather than clavate carapace and in showing distinct \nsexual dimorphism, particularly in the structure of the second maxilla. \n \n  9\nRaepula ira gen. et sp. nov. \nFig. 3a-j, Fig. 4a-i \nHolotype: OUMNH NT.154, a carapace with soft anatomy (Fig. 3b). \nMaterial: About 20 specimens (including OUMNH NT.154-NT.164), most with \nsoft anatomy; a few specimens are detached from their carapace. \nLocality and stratigraphy: Barstow Formation, \u2018Middle Member\u2019; Mid Miocene \n(probably latest Burdigalian Age); Rainbow Basin, Mud Hills, California, USA \n(grid North 35.023716 West 117.040819; see Fig. 1).  \nThe following description of soft anatomy is based on those specimens \nthat have well-preserved appendage anatomy. Typically, carapaces of these \nspecimens are between 0.6 and 0.8mm long, indicating that they represent \npre-adult (probably A-1 and A-2) instars.  \nThe carapace is elongate and sub-reniform in lateral view and \napproximately twice as long as high; greatest length is 972\u00b5m, greatest height \nis 583\u00b5m just anterior of mid-length (Fig. 3a). Dorsal outline gently arched, \nventral outline straight or very weakly concave; posterior margin broadly \nrounded; anterior margin obliquely rounded. Adductor muscle scars (Fig. 5a, \nc-d) form an irregular grouping immediately anterior of mid-length and just \nbelow mid-height, comprising seven elongate scars, each one subdivided into \ntwo by weak sutures. Four indistinct dorsal muscle scars are also present \n(Fig. 5b).  \nNormal (sensillum) pores are scattered across the lateral surface of the \nvalve, but with an apparent concentration along the antero-ventral and \nanterior margins (Fig. 3e-g). These pores are about 1.8\u00b5m in diameter and \nsurrounded by a raised rim, each with a single seta up to 8\u00b5m long. Where \n  10\nthe valve has been dissolved away during preparation, the sensillum pores \nare preserved as silica casts and stand proud of the lateral surface, \nmaintaining the pore structure (Fig. 3g). In several examples, the simple inner \npart of the pores is preserved to about 1\u00b5m length. The pore then widens \nabruptly into a lobed, spheroidal \u201cpocket\u201d about 3\u00b5m diameter.  \nThe first antenna protrudes anteriorly from the body and comprises a \nlarge, sub-rectangular basipod and six podomeres (Fig. 3b-d, h-j; Fig. 4a, b, d, \ne). The 1st podomere is sub-quadrate, with one dorsal sub-apical seta. The \n2nd podomere is narrower, elongate and has one seta dorsally near mid-\nlength and two setae on the apical ventral edge. The 3rd podomere is sub-\nrectangular and bears two setae on the apical ventral edge, and one long seta \non the apical dorsal edge. The 4th podomere is slightly narrower, sub-\nrectangular and bears two setae on the apical-ventral edge. The 5th \npodomere is sub-rectangular, narrower and also bears two setae on the \napical-ventral edge, and at least one seta on the apical-dorsal edge. The 6th \npodomere is small, elongate and terminally bears a cluster of at least three \nsetae. \nThe second antenna comprises a limb stem (curved basipod and \npossible coxa), an endopod comprising three podomeres, and a tiny, slender \nexopod (Fig. 3b-d, f, h-j; Fig. 4a-e). It is not possible to determine whether the \nstructure of the exopod is similar to other Cyprididae (e.g. Karanovic 2008). \nThe 1st podomere is large, elongate, with a \u2018baseball bat\u2019-shaped aesthetasc \nventro-proximally (Fig. 3j) one long seta on the apical ventral edge and at \nleast five setae on the apical inner face: the long setae on the apical inner \nface have been broken-off distally. The 2nd podomere is elongate, about half \n  11\nthe size of the first, with at least two setae at ventral mid-length, at least one \nseta on the sub-apical outer face, and at least three large claws terminally. \nThe 3rd podomere is much smaller, sub-quadrate and has at least two claws \nand three setae.  \nThe labrum is convex, broadly triangular in shape with a rounded \nmargin at the atrium oris (Fig. 3b, c). The holotype, 780\u00b5m long, has a labrum \nabout 100\u00b5m long.  \nThe mandible consists of a large, elongate sub-triangular coxa, a sub-\nquadrate basipod with a single seta, and an endopod that protrudes at the \nside of the labrum and comprises three podomeres (Fig. 3b, c, h, j; Fig. 4c, f). \nThe 1st podomere is short and has at least two setae at the apical ventral \nedge. The 2nd podomere is sub-rectangular, with at least three setae distally. \nThe 3rd podomere is small, tapers distally and has a cluster of setae and at \nleast three claws terminally. \nThe first maxilla comprises a large basipod and a possible proximal \nendite, an endopod consisting of one long podomere and one much shorter \npodomere, three curved endites and a crescent-shaped branchial plate \nbearing at least eleven marginal setae (Fig. 3b, c, h). The endopod has at \nleast three setae on the outer apical side of the 1st podomere. The 2nd \npodomere is small, sub-quadrate with five apical setae. The endites decrease \nin size: the large third endite has at least six apical setae; the second endite \nhas three apical setae; the small first endite has setae but is mostly obscured.  \nThe 2nd maxilla consists of a large basipod, an endite with at least ten \nsetae distally, and a tapered endopod ending in possibly three setae (Fig. 3b, \n  12\nc, h; Fig. 4c, f). In one specimen the endopod terminates in a hook, indicating \na male (Fig. 3h-i).  \nThe 6th appendage comprises a ramus geniculate with a curved \nbasipod (Fig. 4b-e). The ramus has a large, elongate, sub-rectangular 1st \npodomere. Podomeres two and three are smaller, sub-rectangular, and have \nat least one sub-apical ventral seta. The small, distally tapering 4th podomere \nterminates in a large curved claw.  \nThe 7th appendage (Fig. 4a) comprises an elongate basipod \napproximately 45% of the length of the appendage; an elongate 1st \npodomere, about half the length of the basipod; a 2nd podomere of similar \nproportions crossed by three grooves; a 3rd diminutive and distally tapering \npodomere bearing three setae. It is not possible to determine whether the 2nd \npodomere comprises a fused EII and EIII, as seen in, for example, Eucypris \nand Cryptocandona (e.g. Meisch, 2000, fig. 10). The setae on the distal \npodomere comprise a very short h1, possibly associated with a poorly \npreserved pincer organ, and elongate h2 and h3 setae, of similar length. \nThe furca comprises a proximally fused pair of un-segmented curved \nrami, each with two large distal claws and an adjacent seta (Fig. 3a, h, j; Fig. \n4b, d). \nRemarks. The use of acid for extracting the specimens from the rock has \nresulted in the loss of the original shell material and ornament. Reconstructing \nthe precise ontogeny of the ostracod is therefore not possible. The largest \nspecimens - those greater than 0.8mm long - are assumed to be adults. Some \nspecimens less than 0.8mm long, representing probable instars, have also \nbeen used to describe the soft-anatomy of R. ira. Smith & Martens (2000) \n  13\nhave documented considerable changes in appendage morphology between \ninstars of the living cypridid ostracod Eucypris virens and Smith (2000) has \nused the same approach for the description of exceptionally preserved \nostracods from the Cretaceous of Brazil. \nRaepula ira has typical cypridine muscle scars (Fig. 5), comprising a \ngroup of five elongate adductor muscle scars and two elongate mandibular \nscars. A group of ill-defined dorsal muscle scars, comprising at least five \nscars, are also present. \n \nOstracod Taphonomy \nUnlike their calcified carapaces, which are resilient and have a long and well \ndocumented fossil record back to the Early Ordovician (Salas et al. 2007), the \nsoft anatomy (non-biomineralised cuticle) of ostracods has a low preservation \npotential. Details of the body and\/or appendages are known for about 20 fossil \ntaxa (see summary in Smith, 2000) and eight sub-Recent species (see \nMatzke-Karasz et al. 2001). These occurrences share little in common in \nterms of their modes of preservation, and include examples of \nphosphatisation (Smith 2000), pyritisation (Williams et al. 2008a; Farrell et al., \n2009), organic preservation (Orr et al. 2008), inclusion in amber (Keyser & \nWeitschat 2005) and void fills in calcite (Siveter et al. 2003; Siveter et al. \n2007). Such variability reflects the diversity of aquatic environments occupied \nby ostracods and, hence, the range of taphonomic regimes to which they may \npotentially be exposed post-mortem. \nBarstow offers a unique example of silicified ostracod soft anatomy \n(though see mention of potential example in M\u00fcller, 1979). The soft anatomy \n  14\noccurs in association with agape, closed and (rarely) isolated valves, and \ntypically preserves submicron-scale details, such as sensory setae and \nsetules (Fig. 3g). Silicification is biased towards the paired first antennae (e.g. \nFig. 3d; Fig. 4g), though preservation may extend to a near full complement of \nappendages (e.g. Fig. 4b); some carapaces are empty. In most specimens, \nthe appendages are preserved in near life position. However, in several cases \nthey have collapsed and are disorganised (e.g. Fig. 3h-j), or they remain \nattached but are displaced outside of the carapace (Fig. 4h), possibly due to \nthe partial separation of the inner lamella (cf. Orr et al. 2008). In both \nsituations, the ostracods are typically infested with open filamentous networks \nof micro-organisms, and diatoms adhere in large numbers. Such \ncharacteristics are consistent with a more protracted period of decay prior to \nburial and silicification, though confirmatory experimental taphonomic data are \ngenerally lacking for ostracods (although see Langer 1973). \nThe style of preservation is broadly comparable to that of phosphatised \nfossil ostracods (for which see Smith 2000). It predominantly consists of a \nfine-scale replacement or penetrative impregnation of the integument by \nquartz, locally obscured by crude quartz overgrowths (Fig. 4g). The cuticle is \nthe only tissue preserved: no visceral organs have been observed. The sub-\nmicron scale precision with which the integument is replicated, and the \npreservation of structures wholly comprised of epicuticle (e.g. setules) indicate \nthat at least this outermost layer of the cuticle is silicified. However, the \napparent total thickness of the preserved cuticle, as seen in broken sections \nthrough hollow appendages, exceeds that of the epicuticle alone. Therefore, it \nseems likely that part of the underlying procuticle is also preserved, or that \n  15\nselective decomposition of the procuticle allowed centripetal silicification to \nproceed in the vacated space. \nIn contrast, the carapace is seen principally as an internal mould, \nformed by interlocking, comparatively coarse (up to 200\u03bcm), prismatic \nquartzes that terminate in the domicilium (e.g. Fig. 3a, d). As such, the muscle \nscars are visible on the external surface of the specimens (Fig. 5); the calcitic \ncarapace itself is presumed to have been present prior to acid preparation of \nthe material. Hence, the generally observed margins of the carapace actually \nrepresent a cast of the vestibulum. As with the soft integument, the epicuticle \nof the carapace (see Yamada et al. 2004) is preferentially silicified. It forms a \nvery thin (<1\u03bcm) discontinuous layer, often with detritus attached, separated \nfrom the internal mould by a gap which defines the in vivo thickness of the \ncarapace (Fig. 3a).  \nThe presence of large drusy quartz crystals and quartz overgrowths \nindicate that preservation was not silica-limited. Instead, the preferential \npreservation of certain anatomical features (e.g. first antennae) probably \nreflects their inherent decay resistance (cf. Orr et al. 2008). Silicification \nlocally extends a short distance into the sediment along specific (organic-\nrich?) laminae, indicating that it took place after burial. It likely occurred \nepisodically, thus accounting for the observed overgrowths, and may have \ncontinued up to the onset of development of the enclosing pre-compactional \ncarbonate concretions: locally, silica overgrowths of calcite crystal \nterminations (now dissolved) are present. Stellate crystals forming the \npreserved surface of one ostracod carapace (Fig. 4i) resemble opal-CT \n  16\nplatelets (see Stein 1982, fig. 4b) and suggest original replication by opaline \nsilica. \nThough silica frequently pseudomorphs shelly fossils (Schubert et al. \n1997) and preserves a range of ancient bacteria (see Westall et al. 2001), \nfungi (Taylor et al. 2004) and plants (Edwards 2004), it is rarely associated \nwith soft-tissue preservation in animals (Carson 1991). Most documented \nexamples are from hydrothermal sinters (though see Voigt 1988; Lin et al. \n2006) such as the Devonian Rhynie chert complex where a variety of \narthropods, including crustaceans, is encased within silica deposited from \nsupersaturated fluids (Anderson & Trewin 2003); a bird is known from a \ncomparable sub-Recent setting (Channing et al. 2005). The Barstow \nostracods may have occupied a lake with a hydrothermal or volcanic \ninfluence, but their preservation style differs markedly from that of sinter \nfossils: crucially, the ostracod soft anatomy is predominately replaced, rather \nthan encrusted and\/or permineralized as is typical of sinter fossils. This \nsuggests a profoundly different process of silicification, driven by \nheterogeneous nucleation on specific organic substrates, probably from a \nsilica-undersaturated solution (see Leo & Barghoorn 1976). Certainly, the \ngeneral absence of encrustations suggests that the dissolved silica \nconcentration remained below the level required for homogeneous \n(spontaneous) nucleation of opal-A microspheres in the ambient pore waters \n(see Channing & Edwards 2004). \nThe contribution of microbes to silica precipitation, particularly sinter \ndevelopment, has been much debated (see discussions in Konhauser et al. \n2004; Lalonde et al. 2005). In Barstow they probably played a significant \n  17\nindirect role. Incipient microbial degradation of the ostracod cuticle may have \nfacilitated silica infiltration (cf. Channing & Edwards 2004) and created new \nfavourable nucleation sites, thereby enhancing the tissue\u2019s reactivity and \npreservation potential. Additionally, it may have locally decreased the pH and \ncreated a microenvironment conducive to silicification (Carson 1991; Briggs \n2003); buffering by the calcite carapace may explain its preservation as a \nmould rather than a replacement. \n \nConclusion \nConcretions from the Middle Miocene Barstow Formation in the Mud Hills of \nsouthern California yield exceptionally preserved arthropods, including \nspecimens of a cypridid ostracod, Raepula ira gen. et sp. nov. This material \nrepresents a rare occurrence of fossil ostracods with preserved soft tissues \nand is only the second such occurrence from the Neogene. The associated \npalaeolake fauna suggest that R. ira occupied permanent saline-alkaline lakes \nsimilar to those of the present western United States and East African Rift \nValley.  \nTaphonomically the ostracods are unique, in that the soft anatomy is \npreserved as silica, typically with submicron-scale details, such as sensory \nsetae and setules. The ostracod soft anatomy is predominantly replaced, \nrather than encrusted and\/or permineralized as is typical of sinter fossils, \nleading to the conclusion that heterogeneous nucleation took place on specific \norganic substrates, probably from a silica-undersaturated solution. \n \n  18\nIPW & PRW publish with permission of the Executive Director of the British Geological Survey \n(N.E.R.C.).
