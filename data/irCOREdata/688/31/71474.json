The Frattini ideal of L, \u03c6(L), is the largest ideal of L contained in\n1Supported by DGI Grant BFM2000-1049-C02-01\n1\nall maximal subalgebras of L. The Lie algebra L is called \u03c6-free if \u03c6(L) = 0,\nand elementary if \u03c6(B) = 0 for every subalgebra B of L. Elementary Lie\nalgebras were introduced by Stitzinger [24] and Towers [27] by analogy to the\ndefinition of an elementary group given earlier by Bechtell [3]. An interesting\nproperty of an elementary Lie algebra is that it splits over each of its ideals,\nsee [27].\nThe class of elementary Lie algebras is closely related to the class of Lie\nalgebras all of whose nilpotent subalgebras are abelian (called A-algebras)\nand to the class of Lie algebras L such that \u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(L) for all subalgebras\nB of L (called E-algebras). A-algebras have been studied by Drensky [7],\nSheina [23], Premet and Semenov [21] and Dallmer [6]. Since the Frattini\nideal of a nilpotent Lie algebra L is just the derived subalgebra of L, every\nelementary Lie algebra is an A-algebra. E-algebras were introduced by\nStitzinger in [24]. He proved that L is an E-algebra if and only if L\/\u03c6(L)\nis elementary. A Lie algebra L is called strongly solvable if L2 is nilpotent.\nStitizinger also proved in [24] that if L is strongly solvable then L is an\nE-algebra. In this paper it is shown that over a perfect field the converse\nalso holds\nFor algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, elementary Lie al-\ngebras were determined by Towers in [27]. This classification is shown to\nremain true for any algebraically closed field of characteristic different from\ntwo or three.\nFollowing Jacobson [15], we say that a linear Lie algebra L \u2264 gl(V ) is\nalmost algebraic if L contains the nilpotent and semisimple Jordan compo-\nnents of its elements. Every algebraic Lie algebra is almost algebraic. An\nabstract Lie algebra L is called almost algebraic if adL \u2264 gl(L) is almost\nalgebraic. Recently, Zhao and Lu have proved in [28] that every almost-\nalgebraic A-algebra is elementary, whenever the ground field is algebraically\nclosed of characteristic zero. In this paper we prove that every elementary\nLie algebra is almost algebraic, provided that char(F ) = 0.\nThe final section of the paper is devoted to classifying the real elementary\nsimple Lie algebras.\nWe will denote algebra direct sums by \u2295, direct sums of the vector space\nstructure alone by +\u02d9, and semidirect products by \u22ca. The nilradical of L\nwill be denoted by N(L), whilst Asoc(L) will denote the sum (necessarily\ndirect) of the minimal abelian ideals of L.\n2\n2 The solvable case\nOver a field of characteristic zero every solvable Lie algebra is strongly solv-\nable, by Lie\u2019s Theorem. This fails in characteristic p for every p > 0 (see\n[22], page 96). However, we have the following result.\nProposition 2.1 Let L be an elementary solvable Lie algebra over a perfect\nfield F . Then L is strongly solvable.\nProof. Let L be a minimal counter-example. As the hypotheses are sub-\nalgebra closed, every proper subalgebra of L is strongly solvable, and so L\nhas the structure described in Theorem 4 of [5]. Thus, L = A \u22ca B, where\nA is the unique minimal ideal of L, dim A \u2265 2, A2 = 0, B = M+\u02d9Fx with\nM2 = 0, and eitherM is a minimal ideal of B, or B is the three-dimensional\nHeisenberg algebra.\nPick any m \u2208 M and put C = A + Fm. Then C is \u03c6-free, so A \u2286\nN(C) = Asoc(C) by Theorem 7.4 of [26], and A is completely reducible as\nan Fm-module. Write A = \u2295ri=1Ai, where Ai is an irreducible Fm-module\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Then the minimum polynomial of the restriction of ad\nm to Ai is irreducible for each i, and so {(adm)|A : m \u2208 M} is a set of\ncommuting semisimple operators. Let \u2126 be the algebraic closure of F and\nput A\u2126 = A \u2297F \u2126, and so on. As F is perfect, {(adm)|A\u2126 : m \u2208 M} is a\nset of simultaneously diagonalizable linear maps. So, we can decompose A\u2126\ninto\n(A\u2126)\u03b1i = {a \u2208 A\u2126 : [a,m] = \u03b1i(m)a \u2200m \u2208M},\nwhere 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s.\nSuppose first that M is a minimal ideal of B. Then M\u2126 has a basis\nm1, . . . ,mt of eigenvectors of ad x with corresponding eigenvalues \u03b21, . . . , \u03b2t.\nLet 0 6= ai \u2208 (A\u2126)\u03b1i . Then\n[x, ai] =\ns\u2211\nk=1\na\u2032k where a\n\u2032\nk \u2208 (A\u2126)\u03b1k .\nBut now\n0 = [[ai,mj ], x] + [[mj , x], ai] + [[x, ai],mj ]\n= \u03b1i(mj)[ai, x] + \u03b2j [mj , ai] +\n\u2211s\nk=1[a\n\u2032\nk,mj ]\n= \u2212\n\u2211s\nk=1 \u03b1i(mj)a\n\u2032\nk \u2212 \u03b2j\u03b1i(mj)ai +\n\u2211s\nk=1 \u03b1k(mj)a\n\u2032\nk\n3\nHence\n\u03b2j\u03b1i(mj)ai =\ns\u2211\nk=1\n(\u03b1k(mj)\u2212 \u03b1i(mj))a\n\u2032\nk\nThis yields that \u03b2j\u03b1i(mj)ai = 0 and therefore either [x,mj ] = 0 or [mj , ai] =\n0 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. The former is impossible, since it implies that 0 is a\ncharacteristic root of (adx)|M , whence B is two-dimensional abelian and\nL2 is nilpotent. The latter is also impossible, since then [M,A] = 0 and\nL2 \u2286 A\u2295M , which is abelian.\nHence B is the three-dimensional Heisenberg algebra. But then B is a\nnon-abelian nilpotent subalgebra of L and hence not \u03c6-free. This contradic-\ntion establishes the result.\nA Lie algebra L is called an E-algebra if \u03c6(B) \u2264 \u03c6(L) for all subalgebras\nB of L. Groups with the analogous property are called E-groups by Bechtell.\nStitzinger in [24] proved that a Lie algebra is an E-algebra if and only\nif L\/\u03c6(L) is elementary. He also proved that every strongly solvable Lie\nalgebra over an arbitrary field is an E-algebra. Next, we prove the converse\nof this result, provided that the ground field is perfect.\nCorollary 2.2 Let F be perfect. Then every solvable E-algebra is strongly\nsolvable.\nProof. Let L be a solvable E-algebra. If L is \u03c6-free, then L is elementary,\nby [24], and L2 is nilpotent, by Proposition 2.1. So suppose that \u03c6(L) 6=\n0. Then L\/\u03c6(L) is a solvable elementary Lie algebra, and so L2\/\u03c6(L) =\n(L\/\u03c6(L))2 is nilpotent. But then L2 is nilpotent, by Theorem 5 of [2].\nLemma 2.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F and let A be a minimal\nideal of L with [L2, A] = 0. Then A \u2286 Asoc(C) for every subalgebra C of L\ncontaining A.\nProof. We have A3 = [A2, A] = 0. Minimality of A implies that A is abelian.\nMoreover, since [L2, A] = 0, we have that (adx)|A is C-linear for every x \u2208 L.\nThis implies that the sum of the irreducible C-submodules of A is invariant\nunder L, and thus that it coincides with A. The result follows.\nIf A is a subset of L we denote by CL(A) the centraliser of A in L. Now\nwe give a construction of elementary solvable Lie algebras.\n4\nProposition 2.4 Let F be an arbitrary field. Let A be a vector space of\nfinite dimension and let B be an abelian completely reducible subalgebra of\ngl(A). Then the semidirect product A\u22caB is an elementary almost-algebraic\nLie algebra.\nProof. Put L = A\u22caB. Then L is strongly solvable and hence an E-algebra.\nBut A \u2264 Asoc(L) \u2264 CL(A) = A, so L is \u03c6-free by Theorem 7.3 of [26]. It\nfollows that L is elementary, and A = A1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295An where Ai is a minimal\nideal of L for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nIn order to prove that L is almost algebraic, let x \u2208 L, x 6\u2208 A. By\nLemma 2.3 we have that A = Asoc(A+ Fx) and so the action of x on A is\nsemisimple. Let A = E1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ek, where Ei is an irreducible Fx-module.\nThen [Ei, x] = 0 or Ei for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, so we can write A = C\u2295D, where\n[C, x] = 0, [D,x] = D. Put x = c+ d+ b, where c \u2208 C, d \u2208 D, b \u2208 B. Then\n[D, b] = [D,x] = D, so there is a y \u2208 D such that [y, b] = d. Consider the\nautomorphism eady of L. We have eady(b) = (1+ady)(b) = b+[y, b] = b+d,\nso b + d \u2208 eady(B). Since eady(B) is abelian, it follows that ad(b + d) is\nsemisimple. Now (adc)2L = [[L, c], c] \u2286 A2 = 0, whence adc is nilpotent.\nThis yields that L is almost algebraic. The proof is complete.\nAn elementary Lie algebra which can be constructed as in Proposition\n2.4 will be called of type I. Next, we show that every elementary solvable\nLie algebra over a perfect field can be constructed as an algebra direct sum\nof an abelian Lie algebra and a Lie algebra of type I.\nWe say that L is metabelian if L2 is abelian. We denote the centre of L\nby Z(L).\nTheorem 2.5 Let F be perfect. For a solvable Lie algebra L, the following\nstatements are equivalent:\n1. L is elementary,\n2. L is \u03c6-free and strongly solvable,\n3. L is \u03c6-free and metabelian,\n4. L = Asoc(L)\u22caB, where B is an abelian subalgebra of L,\n5. L \u223c= A\u2295E, where A is an abelian Lie algebra and E is an elementary\nLie algebra of type I.\n5\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): This follows from Proposition 2.1.\n(2)\u21d2(3): Let L be \u03c6-free and strongly solvable. By Theorems 7.3 and\n7.4 of [26], we have that L = Asoc(L) \u22ca B, where B is a subalgebra of\nL, and that Asoc(L) is precisely the largest nilpotent ideal of L. As L is\nstrongly solvable, we have L2 \u2264 Asoc(L). This yields that both L2 and B\nare abelian.\n(3)\u21d2(4): This is clear from Theorems 7.3 and 7.4 of [26] as above.\n(4)\u21d2(5): Decompose Asoc(L) = Z(L) \u2295 K, where K is an ideal of L.\nPut E = K+\u02d9B. We have\nCE(K) \u2229B \u2264 Z(E) \u2264 Z(L) \u2229 E = 0,\nso that B . gl(K). Moreover, since K \u2264 Asoc(L) and L = Asoc(L)\u22caB, it\nfollows that K is completely reducible as a B-module. Hence E is of type I.\n(5)\u21d2(1): In Towers [27], it is proved that a direct sum of elementary Lie\nalgebras is elementary. So this follows from Proposition 2.4. This completes\nthe proof.\nCorollary 2.6 An elementary solvable Lie algebra over a perfect field is\nalmost algebraic.\nIn [13], Gein and Varea showed that solvability was a subalgebra lattice\nproperty, provided that L was at least three dimensional and the underlying\nfield was perfect of characteristic different from 2, 3. We now have that the\nsame is true for strong solvability.\nCorollary 2.7 Let L be a strongly solvable Lie algebra over a perfect field\nof characteristic different from 2, 3, and let L\u2217 be a Lie algebra that is lattice\nisomorphic to L. Then either\n1. L\u2217 is three-dimensional non-split simple, or\n2. L\u2217 is strongly solvable and dimL = dimL\u2217.\nProof. Simply combine Theorem 2.5 with Theorem 3.3 of [13].\n6\n3 The non-solvable case\nIf C is a subalgebra of L we denote by R(C) the radical of C, and by N(C)\nthe nilradical of C.\nProposition 3.1 Let F be perfect. Let L be an elementary Lie algebra\nwhich is neither solvable nor semisimple. Then, L = Asoc(L) \u22ca (B+\u02d9S),\nwhere B is abelian, S is a semisimple subalgebra of L and [B,S] \u2264 B. If F\nhas characteristic zero, then [B,S] = 0.\nProof. As L is \u03c6-free, L = Asoc(L) \u22ca C for some subalgebra C of L and\nN(L) = Asoc(L), by Theorem 7.3 of [26]. Let B = R(C). Since C is\nelementary, it splits over B, by [27, Theorem 2.4]. So, C = B+\u02d9S, where S\nis semisimple. It is clear that R(L) = Asoc(L) \u22ca B. By Proposition 2.1,\nwe have that R(L) is strongly solvable. So B2 \u2264 R(L)2 \u2229B \u2286 N(L) \u2229B =\nAsoc(L) \u2229 B = 0. If F has characteristic zero, the final assertion follows\nfrom [25, Theorem 4].\nA Lie algebra all of whose proper subalgebras are abelian is called semi-\nabelian.\nExample Let S be a simple semiabelian Lie algebra over a field of char-\nacteristic p > 0, let B be a faithful finite-dimensional completely reducible\nL-module, and put L = B+\u02d9S where B2 = 0 and L acts on B under the\ngiven L-module action. Then L is elementary, but S is not an ideal of L.\nNotes\n\u2022 Since elementary Lie algebras are Lie A-algebras it follows from Propo-\nsition 2 of [21] that over a field of cohomological dimension \u2264 1 every\nsemisimple elementary Lie algebra is representable as a direct sum of\nsimple ideals, each of which splits over some finite extension of the\nground field into a direct sum of ideals isomorphic to sl(2, F ).\n\u2022 Over a perfect field with non-trivial Brauer group there exists a finite-\ndimensional simple semiabelian Lie algebra (see Theorem 8.5 of [9]),\nand this is elementary.\n7\n\u2022 Let G be the algebra constructed by Gein in Example 2 of [12]. This\nis a seven-dimensional Lie algebra over a certain perfect field F of\ncharacteristic three. Every subalgebra of G of dimension greater than\none is simple. So, G is elementary.\nWe finish this section by proving that the classification of elementary Lie\nalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero given by\nTowers in [27] remains true for any algebraically closed field of characteristic\ndifferent from 2 or 3.\nTheorem 3.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field F of\ncharacteristic 6= 2 or 3. Then L is elementary if and only if\n1. L is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of sl(2, F ), or\n2. there is a basis {a1, . . . , am, b1 . . . , bn} for L such that\n[ai, bj ] = \u2212[bj , ai] = \u03bbijai for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n\nall other products being zero, or\n3. L \u223c= A\u2295B, where A is as in (1) and B is as in (2).\nProof. If char(F ) = 0, then the result is Theorem 3.2 of [27]. Assume\nchar(F ) = p > 3. Let L (6= 0) be elementary. If L is solvable, then L =\nAsoc(L)\u22caB, by Theorem 2.5. Decompose Asoc(L) = A1\u2295\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u2295Am, where\nAi is a minimal ideal of L. As F is algebraically closed, we have dimAi = 1.\nHence L is as in (2).\nNow, let L be semisimple. Since L is an A-algebra, Proposition 2 of\nPremet and Semenov [21] applies and L is as in (1).\nThen suppose that L is neither solvable nor semisimple. By Proposition\n3.1 we have that L = A \u22ca (B+\u02d9S), where 0 6= A = Asoc(L), B is abelian,\n0 6= S is a semisimple subalgebra of L and [B,S] \u2264 B. From [21, Proposition\n2] again it follows that S = S1 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Sr, where Si is an ideal of S and\nSi \u223c= sl(2, F ) for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Put Ci = A+\u02d9Si. We have that Ci is a\n\u03c6-free Lie algebra and so N(Ci) = Asoc(Ci). This yields that A = Asoc(Ci)\nand therefore A is a completely reducible Si-module. Let V be an irreducible\nSi-submodule of A.\nWe claim that dimFV = 1. By general theory, there exists an element e \u2208\nSi such that V is a cyclic Fe-module on which e acts nilpotently. This can\n8\nbe seen by looking at the representatives of the coadjoint orbits of SL(2) on\nsl(2, F )\u2217 (see [11, \u00a72]). Consequently, M = V +\u02d9Fe is a nilpotent subalgebra.\nThis yields that M is abelian, whence [V, e] = 0 and dimFV = 1.\nTherefore, we have that [A,S] = 0. If B = 0, then we have that L is\nas in (3). Suppose then B 6= 0. We have that B+\u02d9S is an elementary Lie\nalgebra, whence Asoc(B+\u02d9S) = N(B+\u02d9S) = B. As above, we obtain that\n[B,S] = 0, from which it follows that L = (A+\u02d9B) \u2295 S. Since A+\u02d9B is a\nsolvable elementary Lie algebra, it is as in (2), and therefore L is as in (3).\nThis completes the proof in one direction. The converse is easily checked.\nThe above result does not hold in characteristic 2: over such a field,\nthe three-dimensional simple Lie algebra with basis e1, e2, e3 and products\n[e1, e2] = e3, [e2, e3] = e1, [e3, e1] = e2 is elementary. The exclusion of char-\nacteristic 3 is used in order to invoke the result of Semenov and Premet,\nwhich in turn relies on [20, Theorem 3]. This last result fails in character-\nistic 3, as is shown by the algebra G ([12, Example 2]) referred to earlier.\nHowever, we know of no counter-example to the above result in character-\nistic 3: if we pass to the algebraic closure, then G becomes psl(3), which is\nno longer elementary.\n4 The characteristic zero case\nA subalgebra T of L is said to be a toral subalgebra of L if T is abelian\nand adLt is semisimple for every t \u2208 T . A Lie algebra L is said to be\nad-semisimple if adx is semisimple for every x \u2208 L.\nProposition 4.1 Let char(F ) = 0. For a solvable Lie algebra L the follow-\ning statements are equivalent:\n1. L is elementary,\n2. L is \u03c6-free and almost algebraic.\nProof. Assume that L is \u03c6-free and almost algebraic. Then L = N(L)+\u02d9T ,\nwhere T is a toral subalgebra of L (see [1] or [26, Theorem 7.5]). Moreover,\nwe have N(L) = Asoc(L) by Theorem 7.4 of [26]. So, L is elementary by\nTheorem 2.5. The converse follows from Corollary 2.6.\n9\nProposition 4.2 Let L be an ad-semisimple Lie algebra over a field of char-\nacteristic zero. Then L is elementary\nProof. Let L be a minimal counter-example. Then it suffices to show that\nL is \u03c6-free. But L = Z(L) \u2295 S, where S is semisimple, by Levi\u2019s Theorem\nand Theorem 1 of [10]. It follows that \u03c6(L) = 0.\nCorollary 4.3 Over the real field every compact semisimple Lie algebra is\nelementary.\nA Lie algebra L is said to be reductive if its adjoint representation is\ncompletely reducible; equivalently, L = S \u2295 Z(L), where S is a semisimple\nideal of L and Z(L) is the centre of L (see [15]).\nProposition 4.4 Let char(F ) = 0. Let L be a Lie algebra such that its\nradical R is elementary and L\/R is ad-semisimple. Then, L is elementary\nand almost algebraic.\nProof. Let S(L) be the largest semisimple ideal of L. Since S(L) is isomor-\nphic to an ideal of L\/R, by Proposition 4.2 it follows that S(L) is elementary.\nSince S(L) is a direct summand of L and since S(L) is almost algebraic, we\nmay suppose without loss of generality that S(L) = 0. By Proposition 4.1\nwe have that R is almost algebraic. Then L is also almost algebraic by\nCorollary 3.1 of [1] (see also [18]).\nTherefore L = N(L)\u22ca (B+\u02d9S) where B is a toral subalgebra of L, S is a\nsemisimple subalgebra of L and [B,S] = 0. We have N(R) = Asoc(R) since\nR is \u03c6-free. As char(F ) = 0, we have that N(R) is a characteristic ideal of\nR and so N(R) \u2264 N(L). It follows that N(L) = Asoc(R) and so N(L) is\nabelian. Put A = N(L). Since every element of B acts semisimply on A,\nwe have that A is completely reducible as a (B \u2295 S)-module, see [15]. It\nfollows that A = Asoc(L). This yields that L is \u03c6-free. To prove that L is\nelementary it suffices to show that every maximal subalgebra M of L is also\n\u03c6-free.\nLet us first consider the case when M does not contain R. Then L =\nR +M , L\/R \u223c= M\/M \u2229 R and M \u2229 R is the radical of M . We have that\nM \u2229 R is elementary and M\/M \u2229 R is ad-semisimple. By the above, we\nobtain that M is \u03c6-free.\n10\nNow suppose that R \u2264 M . Since M \u2229 S is ad-semisimple, by [10, The-\norem 1] it follows that M \u2229 S = Z(M \u2229 S) \u2295 (M \u2229 S)2 and (M \u2229 S)2 is\nsemisimple. Put B\u2217 = B \u2295 Z(M \u2229 S). We have that B\u2217 \u2295 (M \u2229 S)2 is\nreductive. Moreover, since every element of Z(M \u2229 S) acts semisimply on\nS, it acts also semisimply on A (see [15], page 101). It follows that every\nelement of B\u2217 acts semisimply on A. This yields that A is completely re-\nducible as a (B\u2217\u2295 (M \u2229S)2)-module (see [15]) and therefore A \u2264 Asoc(M).\nOn the other hand, we have R(M) = A+\u02d9B\u2217 and A \u2264 N(M). We claim that\nA = N(M). Let x \u2208 B\u2217 \u2229 N(M). We have that (adx)|A is nilpotent and\nsemisimple. So, x \u2208 CL(A). Moreover, we have that [x,B] \u2286 [S,B] = 0.\nThis yields that x \u2208 CL(R). Since CL(R) \u2229 S is a semisimple ideal of L,\nwe have CL(R) \u2229 S = 0, whence CL(R) = Z(R). Decompose x = b + z,\nb \u2208 B, z \u2208 Z(M \u2229 S). We have z \u2208 R \u2229 S = 0. This yields that\nx \u2208 B \u2229 Z(R) \u2264 Z(L) = 0 and therefore A = N(M), as claimed. Hence\nA = Asoc(M). Since M splits over A, it follows that M is \u03c6-free. This\ncompletes the proof.\nCorollary 4.5 Let char(F ) = 0. Let A be a vector space of finite dimen-\nsion. Let K be a reductive subalgebra of gl(A) such that K2 is non-zero and\nad-semisimple and every non-zero element of Z(K) is a semisimple trans-\nformation of A. Then, the semidirect product A\u22caK is an elementary almost\nalgebraic Lie algebra.\nProof. Put L = A\u22caK. We have that R(L) = A+\u02d9Z(K). By Proposition 2.4,\nit follows that R(L) is an elementary Lie algebra. Also, we have L\/R(L) \u223c=\nK2. So that L\/R(L) is ad-semisimple. The result follows from Proposition\n4.4.\nA Lie algebra which can be constructed as in the above corollary will be\ncalled of type II.\nTheorem 4.6 Let char(F ) = 0. A Lie algebra L is elementary if and only\nif L \u223c= A\u2295B\u2295S, where A is abelian, B is a Lie algebra of type I or of type\nII and S is an elementary semisimple Lie algebra.\nProof. Let L be elementary. Then L splits over Z(L), so L = Z(L) \u2295 L\u02c6,\nwhere L\u02c6 is a centerless Lie algebra. Now let S(L\u02c6) be the largest semsimple\nideal of L\u02c6. Then we have that L\u02c6 = K \u2295 S(L\u02c6), where K is a centerless Lie\n11\nalgebra which has no non-zero semisimple ideals. If K is solvable, then we\nfind that K is an elementary Lie algebra of type I.\nThen assume that K is not solvable. By Proposition 3.1 it follows that\nK = Asoc(K)\u22ca (B \u2295 S), where B is abelian, S is semisimple and [B,S] =\n0. Let 0 6= s \u2208 S be such that adSs is nilpotent. Then we have that\nAsoc(K) + Fs is a nilpotent subalgebra of L. Hence [s,Asoc(L)] = 0. This\nyields that s \u2208 CK(R(K))\u2229S = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore S has\nno non-zero ad-nilpotent elements. As S is semisimple and char(F ) = 0, it\nfollows that S is ad-semisimple. Put C = CK(Asoc(K))\u2229 (B\u2295S). We have\nthat C is an ideal of the reductive Lie algebra B\u2295S, so C = (C\u2229B)\u2295(C\u2229S).\nIt follows that C\u2229B \u2264 Z(K) = 0 and that C\u2229S = 0 since it is a semisimple\nideal of K. This yields that B\u2295S . gl(Asoc(K)) and therefore K is of type\nII. This completes the proof in one direction.\nThe converse follows from Proposition 2.4 and Corollary 4.5.\nCorollary 4.7 An elementary Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero\nis almost algebraic.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 4.6, Proposition 2.4 and Corollary 4.5.\nCorollary 4.8 Let char(F ) = 0. For a Lie algebra L without non-zero\nsemisimple ideals, the following statements are equivalent:\n1. L is elementary,\n2. L is almost algebraic and an A-algebra,\n3. L is almost algebraic, N(L) is abelian and L\/R(L) is ad-semisimple,\n4. L is almost algebraic, \u03c6-free and L\/R(L) is ad-semisimple.\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): This follows from Corollary 4.7.\nFrom now on in this proof we assume that L is almost algebraic. Then\nwe have that L = N(L)+\u02d9B+\u02d9S, where B is a toral subalgebra of L, S is a\nsemisimple subalgebra of L and [B,S] = 0.\n(2)\u21d2(3): Clearly, N(L) is abelian. It remains to prove that S is ad-\nsemisimple. Let s \u2208 S such that adSs is nilpotent. Then (ads)|N(L) is\nnilpotent too. This yields that N(L) + Fs is a nilpotent subalgebra of L\nand therefore [N(L), s] = 0. Thus, s \u2208 CL(R(L)) \u2229 S = 0 because L has no\n12\nnon-zero semisimple ideals. Hence S has no non-zero ad-nilpotent elements.\nAs char(F ) = 0, we have that S is ad-semisimple.\n(3)\u21d2(4): Since N(L) is a completely reducible (B\u2295S)-module and since\nN(L) is abelian, it follows that N(L) = Asoc(L). Since L splits on N(L),\nwe have that L is \u03c6-free.\n(4)\u21d2(1): By Theorem 7.4 of [26] we have N(L) = Asoc(L). It then fol-\nlows from Theorem 2.5 thatN(L)+\u02d9B is elementary. Since R(L) = N(L)+\u02d9B,\nProposition 4.4 now gives that L is elementary.\n5 The real field case\nA subalgebra P of L is called parabolic if P\u2297F \u2126 contains a Borel subalgebra\n(that is, a maximal solvable subalgebra) of L\u2297F \u2126, where \u2126 is the algebraic\nclosure of F . Over a field of characteristic zero, all maximal subalgebras\nof a reductive Lie algebra are reductive or parabolic (see [4], [16], [19]); it\nfollows that a reductive Lie algebra is elementary if and only if its parabolic\nsubalgebras are \u03c6-free.\nFor results concerning Lie algebras over the real field we refer the reader\nto the books by Helgason ([14]) and Knapp ([17]).\nTheorem 5.1 Let F be the real field. For a simple Lie algebra L, the\nfollowing statements are equivalent:\n1. L is elementary,\n2. L is an A-algebra,\n3. L is compact or isomorphic to one of the following Lie algebras: sl(2,R),\nsl(2,C)R, so(n, 1) (n > 3).\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): This is clear.\n(2)\u21d2(3): Let L be a non-compact A-algebra. Suppose first that L = L\u00afR,\nthe realisation of the complex simple Lie algebra L\u00af. If N\u00af is a nilpotent\nsubalgebra of L\u00af then N\u00afR is a nilpotent subalgebra of L, and hence abelian.\nIt follows that N\u00af is abelian and thus that L\u00af is an A-algebra. The proof of\nTheorem 3.2 of [27] then shows that L\u00af \u223c= sl(2,C).\n13\nSo assume now that L is a non-compact real form of a complex simple\nLie algebra. The only such algebras for which the nilpotent subalgebra N in\nthe Iwasawa decomposition of L is abelian are sl(2,R) and so(n, 1) (n > 3).\n(3)\u21d2(1): Suppose now that L is one of the algebras described in (3).\nIf L is compact it is elementary by Corollary 4.3, and sl(2,R) is clearly\nelementary.\nNext suppose that L \u223c= sl(2,C)R, and let S be a subalgebra of L. Then\nS \u2297 C is a subalgebra of L \u2297 C, which is elementary. This yields 0 =\n\u03c6(S \u2297 C) = \u03c6(S)\u2297 C, by [8], whence \u03c6(S) = 0 and L is elementary.\nFinally, let L = so(n, 1) (n > 3). We identify L with\n{(\nB u\nuT 0\n)\n: u \u2208 Rn, B \u2208Mn\u00d7n(R), B\nT = \u2212B\n}\nFrom the remarks at the beginning of this section it suffices to show that the\nparabolic subalgebras of L are \u03c6-free. Now any such subalgebra is conjugate\nto a standard parabolic subalgebra P with Langlands decomposition P =\n(M \u2295A)+\u02d9N , where M \u2295A is reductive and N is an ideal of P contained in\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 u u\u2212uT 0 0\nuT 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 : u \u2208 Rn\u22121\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe .\nClearly N is abelian and every element of A acts semisimply on N , so P is\n\u03c6-free.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors are grateful to the referee for a number of helpful comments\nand for spotting a flaw in the original proof of Proposition 2.4.\nReferences\n[1] L.
