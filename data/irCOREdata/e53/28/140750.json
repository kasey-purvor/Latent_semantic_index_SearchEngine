The energy from the incident photons is absorbed and converted into surface\nplasmons. By creating a state of total internal reflection (TIR) using an optical prism of\nsuitable geometry, a surface plasmon evanescent wave (SPEW) is created at the interface\nbetween a metal (e.g. gold or silver) layer and the adjacent medium (Maier, 2007). The\nSPEW extends into the materials on either side of the metal film with the intensity of the\nSPEW depending on the angle of incidence \u03b8 (Maier, 2007; Zhang & Uttamchandani,\n1988; Homola et al. 1999). Oscillations in the wave generated on the side of the metal\nopposite to the direction of the incident light (at the working interface) are very sensitive to\nchanges in the local refractive index close to the surface, including those due to the\nadsorption of molecules. This effect can extend through materials bound to the working\nsurface, allowing for binding events between receptor structures (antibodies, aptamers etc.)\nbound to these materials and their ligands to be measured. Despite its non-selective nature,\nmeasuring only changes in refractive index, and its low sensitivity towards binding of small\nmolecules, SPR has become a powerful and inherently flexible sensor platform when\ncombined with various natural and synthetic receptors (Homola, 2003).\nThe introduction of sensing layers onto the working surface is traditionally performed by\n\u201cbulk\u201d methods, such as spin coating or in-situ polymerization over the entire surface of the\nsensor chip. For example Lavine et al. immobilized lightly cross-linked poly N-(n-propyl)\nacrylamide molecularly imprinted beads by spin coating onto an SPR slide (Lavine et al.\n2007). The swelling properties of these beads were used to measure the concentration of\nthe template theophylline. Gabai and coworkers used electropolymerisation to deposit a\n4boronic acid\/acrylamide co-polymer film on gold SPR slides which were used to measure\nthe concentration of glucose (Gabai et al. 2001). Similarly Damos et al. electropolymerized\nultra-thin films of (poly)methylene blue and studied them using real-time electrochemical\nSPR (Damos et al. 2005). In these examples the area of the deposited sensing layer extends\nbeyond the focal point of SPR, covering the entire slide. As the interrogation of the\nmolecular interactions by the laser occurs only over a small portion of deposited material\nduring any sensing process, this complete coverage becomes wasteful in terms of reagents.\nFor expensive analytes such as peptides or aptamers this can rapidly become cost\nprohibitive for a commercial sensor system. Moreover, by limiting materials to the point of\ninteraction only, an increase in sensitivity could theoretically be achieved, as capture of\ntarget analytes outside of the sensing zone should not occur. Any analyte present would\nonly be able to bind at the point of interest, meaning binding events will not be \u201clost\u201d by\noccurring outside this area. A third benefit lies in the option for miniaturization\n(interrogation at the point of interest only can lead to smaller devices, requiring smaller\nchips and fluidics).\nTo perform this specific placement of the sensing medium, we have used the SPEW itself\nto determine the site at which the material is deposited. The simplest way to envisage this is\nthrough a photo-initiated polymerization process, using the energy of the SPEW to drive\nthe reaction in-situ.\nIn order to utilize the energy of the SPEW to initiate polymerization at the SPR sensor\nsurface (Figure 1a) and localize the polymer spot to the sensing zone, a photoinitiator with\nthe appropriate wavelength sensitivity must be used. Dye-sensitization provides a\nconvenient method for extending the wavelength of light used to initiate free radical\n5polymerization far into the visible spectrum and even to the near infra-red (Oster & Yang,\n1968). Phenothiazine dyes such as thionine and methylene blue have proved particularly\nuseful at red-sensitization of aqueous-soluble monomers when employed as part of a photo-\nredox initiator couple, the second component being a mild reducing agent such as a\ndiketone (Chaberek et al., 1965a,b), triethanolamine (Hsia Chen, 1965) or a salt of a\nsulfinic acid such as p-toluenesulfinic acid (Rust et al., 1969). An investigation of the\nmechanism of the latter system found that the triplet excited state of methylene blue was\nreduced by sulfinate ions and that the sulfinate-derived radicals were largely responsible\nfor the polymerization of acrylamide, rather than semimethylene blue radicals (Figure 1b)\n(Margerum et al., 1971).\nInsert Figure 1 here\nIn this paper we report the use of the photo-redox couple of methylene blue and sodium p-\ntoluenesulfinate to initiate polymerization in an aqueous solution of N,N-methylene-bis-\nacrylamide and methacrylic acid. The energy required to initialize the reaction is supplied\nby the SPEW effect. The deposition was found to be controllable by switching the laser\non\/off, and by changing the relative concentrations of the components. As such we were\nable to alter the thickness of deposition. The polymer was used as a functionalized support\nfor the immobilization of protein G, with the resulting biosensor being used to demonstrate\nthe specific rebinding of immunoglobulin IgG (a typical model system). The system was\nshown to be highly reproducible.\n6Materials and Methods\nMaterials\nMethylene blue, sodium p-toluenesulfinate hydrate, acrylamide and methacrylic acid were\nobtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK) N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide, and\nsodium acetate trihydrate were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK)\ndisodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were obtained from\nAcros Organics (Loughborough, UK). General purpose buffer (Biacore HBS-EP,\ncontaining: 0.01M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15M NaCl, 3mM EDTA and 0.005% v\/v Surfactant\nP20) and amine coupling reagents kit (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide\nhydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinamide (NHS) and 1.0M ethanolamine\nhydrochloride pH 8.5) were obtained from Biacore (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).\nProtein G and IgG were purchased from Sigma (Gillingham, UK). All solvents were of\nHPLC grade and used as received.\nExperimental Setup\nAn SPR instrument (NanoSPR-321, NanoSPR, USA), with ATR prism was set-up in the\nfollowing manner. A glass prism with a refractive index of 1.6160 was selected as optimum\nfor use with SPR in water, with a nominal ATR angle of 65 degrees. A gold coated slide\n(20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 1 mm), coated with a 45 nm layer of gold over a 5 nm layer of chromium\n(NanoSPR, USA) was mounted on the upper face of the prism with the gold layer\nuppermost. A thin layer of index matching fluid (NanoSPR, USA) was applied between the\nglass face of the slide and the prism. Care was taken such that no air bubbles were trapped\nat the interface and excess index matching fluid was cleaned from the optical face of the\nprism. A transparent block with microfluidic connections, separated by a silicone elastomer\nspacer (approx 1 mm in thickness) was clamped to the gold-coated face of the slide. Within\n7this spacer two cut-out areas defined chambers, each with its own microfluidic connections\nthrough the transparent block. These chambers therefore act as two independently\noperating flow channels, each interrogated with a separate light beam from the instrument.\nThe fluidic connections were attached to a peristaltic pump (Gilson, France), allowing\nliquid flow through the chambers and across the working face. Pure water and all buffers\nand solutions were degassed by sonication and\/or sparging with argon before introduction\ninto the flow system to avoid the formation of air bubbles on the sensor chip. Solutions\nwere changed by exchange of the reservoirs containing the stock solutions under stopped-\nflow conditions. Data collection and instrument control was performed using the\nNanoSPR\u00ae application software running on a PC.\nCalibration was performed by filling the solution cell with pure water (previously degassed\nby sonication), using the calibrate function of the NanoSPR\u00ae software. The SPR curve in\nwater was recorded at the outset of each experiment by scanning the angle of the incident\nlight beam (Ii in Figure 1a). This is achieved by rotating the prism and solution cell\nassembly relative to the light source and detector, under software control. The light source\nwas a diode laser emitting red light (GeAs laser, \uf06c = 670 nm). Calibration was performed\neach time a new gold slide was fitted to the instrument.\nIn-situ polymerization\nA stock solution of monomers was prepared comprising 0.1 g of N,N-methylene-bis-\nacrylamide and 0.9 g of methacrylic acid dissolved in 10 mL of water (9: 1 ratio). A stock\nsolution of methylene blue (10 mg mL-1) in water was also prepared. For each\npolymerization experiment, two vials containing the monomer stock solution (0.5 mL)\ndiluted with water (1.5 mL) were prepared. An equal amount of the methylene blue stock\n8solution was added to each vial: 0, 5, 7.5, 10 or 15 \uf06dL, depending on the experiment, to\ngive final dye concentrations of 0, 2.5, 3.75, 5 or 7.5 \uf06dg mL-1. An aliquot (20 \uf06dL) of a\nfreshly prepared solution of sodium p-toluenesulfinate hydrate in water (10 mg mL-1) was\nadded to one of the vials. The solution containing the sulfinate salt was protected from light\nby wrapping the outside of the glass vial with aluminum foil. Water (10 \uf06dL) was added to\nthe second vial, which was identical therefore to the first, except for the absence of the\nsulfinate salt. Both solutions were degassed by passage of a stream of argon for at least 3\nminutes shortly before use.\nA calibration was performed, as described above, then the contents of the solution cell were\nreplaced by flowing a portion of the solution containing monomers and dye only, and the\nSPR curve was again obtained by scanning the angle of the incident light. The angle of the\nlight beam was then adjusted to the position of TIR, indicated by the minimum point of the\nSPR curve. This was achieved using the \u201cmeasurement in slope\u201d function of the\nNanoSPR\u00ae control software.\nThe light beam was temporarily blocked by an opaque obstruction (e.g. a piece of card)\nwhile the contents of the solution cell were exchanged for a portion of the solution\ncontaining monomer, dye and sulfinate salt. The dye and sulfinate constitute a photoredox\ncouple, capable of initiating polymerization in red light. Removal of the blockage in the\nlight beam allowed the SPR condition to be re-established at the gold surface and\npolymerization to proceed. The formation of a spot of polymer at the gold surface rapidly\nensued. The SPR apparatus was shielded from stray sources of light during the\npolymerization process.\n9The deposition of polymer could be followed by the change in intensity of the reflected\nbeam with time. The polymerization was limited by the penetration of the evanescent wave\nof red light and did not occur indefinitely, reaching a maximum thickness of film.\nPolymerization could be stopped earlier if necessary by removing the light source and\nflushing the monomer solution from the sample cell. No polymerization in solution was\nobserved; the reaction being localized to the interrogation point. The excess unreacted\nmonomer solution was removed from the solution cell and the polymer was washed with\nwater until the SPR curve stabilized. The SPR curve was then recorded to demonstrate the\npresence, and calculate the thickness of the polymer layer (by refractive index, see below).\nAdjusting the parameters of the experiment (concentrations of the components, time of\nirradiation, angle of incidence of the laser light etc.) affected the rate of polymerization and\nthe size and thickness of the deposited polymer spot. This allowed a further level of control\nover the polymerization process.\nCalculation of polymer thicknesses\nThe experimental SPR spectra of the polymer layers were fitted to the theoretical curves\nbased on five-phase Fresnel calculations, using the Neelder-Mead algorithm of\nminimization (Beketov et al. 1998). The fitting procedure was based on modelling the SPR\ncurve in a multilayer system, where each of the components: glass prism, Cr adhesion\nlayer, Au layer, polymer and liquid environment were taken into account. Calculations of\nthe scattering matrix for the multilayer system allowed the modelling of the form and\nangular position of the SPR curves with those obtained by experiment. The results of\nmodelling allowed us to obtain approximate values for the complex refractive index of the\npolymer and its thickness.\n10\nImmobilization of protein G and analysis of specific interactions\nIn order to demonstrate the fabrication of a biosensor using a polymer layer as the\nimmobilization material; protein G was coupled to a carboxylic acid-functionalized\npolymer and the specific interaction of IgG with the immobilised protein G was observed\nby SPR. This was selected as it is a generic system and has been well characterized.\nCoupling and assay conditions were based on those given in a Biacore\u00ae application note\n(Biacore Application Note). Polymers were formed, as described above, at a dye\nconcentration of 2.5 \uf06dg mL-1. After thorough washing with water, the available carboxylic\ngroups of the polymer were activated with a solution of EDC (0.2M) and NHS (0.05M) for\n10 minutes. The sensor surface was then flushed with phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 and the\nsystem was allowed to stabilize. Protein G, 10 \u03bcg mL-1 was added in 10mM acetate buffer,\npH 4.0 (ac. b) and allowed to react with the activated polymer for 10 minutes before\nflushing again with phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. A solution of ethanolamine was then added\nand allowed to react with any uncoupled NHS ester groups. This was followed by\nBiacore\u00ae HBS-EP mixed buffer solution, consisting of 10mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150mM\nNaCl, 3.4mM EDTA, 0.005% v\/v Surfactant P20 to wash away excess protein, the solution\npassing through the flow cell was then switched to 0.1M HCl to remove non-specifically\nbound material, then back to acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Once the sensor response had\nstabilized, IgG, (200 \u03bcg mL-1) in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.0 was added. After ten\nminutes 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5 was passed through the cell. Once the sensor response\nhad stabilized, 0.1M HCl was flowed over the sensor surface to regenerate the polymer-\nimmobilized protein G (Biacore Application Note). Finally the solution in the flow system\nwas returned to 10 mM acetate buffer pH 5.0. The same experiment was run concurrently\nin the second channel, all steps being performed in the same manner except for the absence\nof protein G.\n11\nThe above experiment was then repeated using stepped concentrations of IgG to study\nbinding capacity of the immunosensor. Finally the IgG binding, desorption and\nregeneration steps were repeated in series to demonstrate the reproducibility and stability of\nthe system.\n12\nResults and Discussion\nThe choice of a photo-initiator system to selectively polymerize a mixture of monomers\ncontained in the solution cell of an SPR sensor was determined by the wavelength of light\nused in the instrument chosen for this study. As the NanoSPR\u2122 platform allowed us easily\nto select and fix the angle of incidence as well as follow the sensogram during\npolymerization, this instrument was chosen for this work. The NanoSPR\u2122 uses a GaAs\nsemiconductor laser (\uf06c = 670 nm), therefore a red-sensitive photoinitiator was required.\nThe photo-redox couple of methylene blue and sodium p-toluenesulfinate were selected as\na water-soluble initiator, compatible with the laser wavelength used and known to be\ncapable of initiating the polymerization of acrylamide and other water-soluble monomers\n(Rust et al., 1969). Initial experiments were conducted with solutions of acrylamide, N,N-\nmethylene-bis-acrylamide mixtures to test whether polymerization occurred at the SPR\nposition. This was indeed the case, not only was polymer formed on the surface of the gold\nslide, creating an image of the SPR spot, and nowhere else (on the surface or in solution)\nbut the polymerization process was easily followed by the SPR sensogram, recorded during\npolymer formation. This allowed for both feedback on the progress of polymerization and\nthe possibility to terminate polymerization at a predetermined point by blocking the light-\nbeam when a particular sensor response had been achieved. No specific steps were taken to\nensure adhesion of the polymer to the gold surface. The bond between the polymer and\ngold appears to be quite strong and polymer spots were stable to washing and a range of\nchemical treatments. It is possible that adhesion is mediated through sulphur atoms present\nin the initiator components (Figure 1b). Typical polymer spots on the gold surface can be\nseen in Figure 2.\n13\nInsert Figure 2 here\nThe thicker polymer spots were clearly visible to the naked eye, however since the aim was\nto produce a platform for the immobilization of proteins and other receptor, very thin layers\n(ideally of the order of 10s of nanometers) were required. In addition the polymer system\nchosen for our initial work lacked suitable functionality for protein attachment. Subsequent\nexperiments were therefore performed with methacrylic acid solutions, containing 10 %\nw\/w of the cross-linker N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide. Our initial experiments with\nacrylamide had shown that the thickness of polymer formed was determined by the\nconcentrations of the components (dye, monomer and p-toluenesulfinate salt) of the\npolymerization mixture (results not shown). We therefore chose to vary the concentration\nof methylene blue in a series of experiments designed to follow the progress of\npolymerization with time, using the methacrylic acid system, described above. The results\nare shown in Figure 3.\nInsert Figure 3 here\nFigure 3 shows the sensor response recorded at fixed angle during photo-polymerization. In\nthe absence of methylene blue, no polymerization was observed, whereas in the presence of\nincreasing concentrations of the dye a greater SPR response was seen. Curves showed\ntypical polymerization behaviour; exhibiting a short induction period, followed by more\nrapid growth of the layer. It was evident however that the sensorgram curves rapidly\nreached a plateau within a few minutes, the level of which was dependent on the initial dye\nconcentration (Figure 3-II). It is not clear why this behaviour is seen since dye and\nmonomer were clearly not exhausted; the solutions over the gold slide still appeared to\n14\nshow a uniform blue colour and the same monomer concentration was used in all\nexperiments. The most likely explanation is that the rate of initiation of polymerization will\ndepend upon both the intensity of the evanescent wave, which rapidly falls off with\ndistance from the gold surface, and the ability of the initiator to adsorb the energy of the\nincident light. The latter depends upon the dye concentration, therefore in order to produce\na thicker layer; a higher dye concentration must be used.\nInsert Figure 4 here\nThe SPR curves, determined with water in the flow cell, corresponding to the experiments\nshown in Figure 3-Ia-d, can be seen in Figure 4, curves a-d, respectively. It can be seen that\nwith increasing dye concentration, a shallower curve is seen with progressive displacement\nto the right-hand side of the plot (higher angle) with respect to that for bare gold. Curve a in\nFigure 4 (2.5 \uf06dg mL-1 dye) is only slightly displaced from that of the unmodified surface,\nwhereas even at 3.75 \uf06dg mL-1 methylene blue concentration (Figure 4, curve b), the effect\nis quite marked, potentially reducing the sensitivity of a sensor based on this layer. An\nanalysis of the SPR curves allowed the refractive index of the polymer to be calculated.\nThis was determined to be: real part: 1.345-1.348, imaginary part: 0.03-0.04. From a\nknowledge of the refractive indices, the layer thicknesses were estimated to be: a) 20 \u00b1 5\nnm, (2.5 \u00b5g mL-1 methylene blue); b) 60 \u00b1 10nm, (3.75 \u00b5g mL-1); c) 150 \u00b1 20 nm, (5.0 \u00b5g\nmL-1) and d) 200 \u00b1 30nm (7.5 \u00b5g mL-1). It appears therefore that adequate control over the\nextent of polymerization and consequently the thickness of the polymer film can be exerted\nsimply through choice of the initial dye concentration, without any need to terminate the\npolymerization by blocking the light source.\n15\nHaving demonstrated the formation of thin films of a carboxylic acid-functionalized\npolymer at the point of interrogation, we set out to demonstrate the utility of these films as\na support for the immobilization of proteins in biosensors. A number of possible model\nsystems, commonly used in SPR-based biosensors, were available to us (Yu et al., 2007).\nThe protein G - IgG binding couple is often used a reference system for the Biacore\u00ae SPR\nplatform (Newcombe et al., 2006), hence we elected to use this simple, but well studied\nmodel system. Polymers were formed using 2.5 \uf06dg mL-1 dye concentration, as described\nabove. The activation of the acidic polymer with EDC\/NHS, protein immobilization and\nblocking with ethanolamine was carried out according to a Biacore\u00ae application note for\nmodification of their CM5 sensor chip with antibodies (Biacore Application Note). The\nsame sequence of solutions were passed through the second channel of the NanoSPR,\nexcept that buffer alone was used in place of the protein G solution, to act as control. The\nsensorgram, following the change of SPR angle during the immobilization step and\nsubsequent addition of IgG, is shown in Figure 5. The working channel shows both a\ngreater angular shift on binding IgG and more complete regeneration than the reference\nchannel, where non-specific interactions are responsible for the response seen.\nInsert Figure 5 here\nThe concentration dependence of the biospecific reaction was determined by addition of\nsuccessively higher concentrations of IgG in acetate buffer, pH 5.0, monitored by changes\nin the SPR angle. These data are presented in Figure 6-I and in isotherm form in the insert.\nRegeneration was again achieved by treatment with 0.1 M HCl. Reproducibility of the\nsensor response was also investigated over a number of cycles (Figure 6-II) with consistent\nresults being shown on each cycle, suggesting that the protein is covalently bound to the\n16\npolymer support and that neither the protein nor the polymer are dislodged by normal\nconditions of use. The results are comparable to those obtained using conventional\nimmobilization methods (Newcombe et al., 2006).\nInsert Figure 6 here\n17\nConclusions\nThis work has successfully demonstrated the in-situ polymerization of methacrylic acid,\ncrosslinked with N,N-methylene-bis-acrylamide using the energy of the plasmon resonance\nfield created under conditions of total internal reflection at a gold surface. The red-\nsensitized photo-initiator couple, comprising methylene blue and sodium p-\ntoluenesulfinate, was shown to initiate polymerization in the evanescent wave field,\nconsistent with the wavelength of the light used to excite the plasmon. Polymer growth was\nconfined to the position of interrogation of the gold surface by the laser spot with no\npolymerization observed elsewhere within the system (either on the gold surface, or in\nsolution). Fine control of the thickness of the polymer film was demonstrated by\nadjustment of the dye concentration within the polymerization mixture. The resultant\ncarboxylic acid-functionalized polymers were shown to be a suitable platform for protein\nimmobilization following carbodiimide-mediated activation with N-hydroxysuccinimide.\nThis was demonstrated for the model system protein G\/IgG. While the system may still be\nfurther optimized, a working biosensor, with comparable performance to an industry\nstandard, was constructed from a bare gold SPR chip within 2-3 hours.\nThe use of the SPEW to initiate and control the production of a polymer support on a SPR\nchip is a novel process, and has a number of obvious benefits. Since the supporting layer is\ncreated by formation of a free radical\u2013initiated polymer, a wide range of functionality can\nbe introduced by varying the choice of monomer (including the use of custom-synthesized\nreceptors and ligands modified with polymerizable groups) and other polymer components.\nThe polymerization can be carried out under mild conditions and the photon energy used\nfor excitation is relatively low, compared to UV irradiation for example. This could be\nimportant when using photo-sensitive ligands. By localizing the polymer at the position at\n18\nwhich sensing takes place and not modifying the whole surface, it is possible to concentrate\nthe recognition elements precisely where they are needed, provided the bare gold is treated\nto minimize non-specific adsorption.\nIt is important that the polymer layer thickness is not excessive, since the polymer adds to\nboth the scattering and adsorption of light, both of which can degrade the sensor response.\nIn our experiments we used the thinnest layer, since this material had the least effect on the\nSPR curve (see Figure 4, curve a). It was not possible to see this polymer, either by naked\neye or by microscopic examination; therefore the layers shown in Figure 2 are not typical\nof those suitable for biosensor preparation. In all other cases, where higher dye\nconcentrations than 2.5 \uf06dg mL-1 were used, the SPR curve became broader and shallower\nas the dye concentration (and hence polymer thickness) increased, Figure 4, curves b-d.\nAny change in polymer composition or in the optical set-up will require an optimisation of\nthe polymer layer thickness to be performed to achieve the best response from the final\nsensor.\nWhat is particularly interesting about this work is the direct use of existing optics to\nperform the formation of the polymer support. Combined with a suitable choice of\nmonomers, the creation of a specific sensor platform can be performed remotely, without\nhaving to access the machine. This in turn reduces production costs and time, whilst giving\noperational flexibility. The potential for miniaturization exists on the device, as in theory\nthe only part of a chip needed is that which contains the point of interest. As the optics used\nfor the in situ polymerization are the same as those used to analyse binding, the possibility\nof developing multisensor systems exists, with the in-built optics creating hundreds of\ndifferent binding sites on the same substrate. This is possible as a \u201cblanket\u201d coating of the\n19\nrecognition element is not present; but is bound to specific points on the chip which can be\nlocated by Cartesian coordinates.\nThe results presented here clearly show the performance of the present system is\ncomparable to those currently available, however using this technique a higher effective\nconcentration of sensing molecules can theoretically be achieved by limiting any binding to\nthe point of interrogation. This would mean that rare or expensive receptors could be used\nmore efficiently. This proposed increase in sensitivity is currently under study. Other\nongoing work is aimed at the preparation of polymeric films at the surface of the SPR chip\nbearing an additional range of functionality. A further aim is to use the polymerization\nprocess itself as the means to introduce recognition properties, through the use of templates\n(molecular imprinting) as well as the creation of new biosensors.\nAcknowledgements\nV.C. thanks NATO for financial support (grant No. NATO CLG981776) and SP\nacknowledges receipt of The Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award.\n20\nReferences\nBeketov, G.V., Shirshov, Y.M., Shynkarenko, O.V., Chegel, V.I., 1998.
