Scope: monograph. ISBN 978 0 387 74368 4. Level: undergraduate\nphysicists and engineers, musicologists, guitar builders and players.\nWhy do guitars sound like they do, and how do you set about making one? These are\ncentral questions addressed by Richard French in this attractive new book. He is both an\nassistant professor of engineering and also a guitar builder and player, so that one could\nhardly imagine anybody better equipped to write a book with this wide coverage.\nFrench writes, in part, with his own undergraduates very much in mind. He describes\nthem as \u201c...mathematically literate, but not always comfortable with calculus\u201d, and this\nspecifies quite well the level of the more mathematical chapters: calculus is used sparingly,\nand only when necessary. But many chapters are of a practical or descriptive character\nand involve no mathematics at all. To set the context, French opens the book with a\nshort history of the guitar, both classical and electric. I found this very interesting in all\nsorts of ways. For example, I had not appreciated the instrument\u2019s dramatically differing\nsocial contexts in the USA, where it carried connotations of slavery and cowboys, and in\nEurope where it was adopted early on by serious musicians.\nSo that the book can be read by musical non-experts, and to provide essential support\nfor the later discussions of design, French then provides a substantial chapter on acoustics\nand musical theory. It covers the basics of music, scales and temperament, ways of\nquantifying sound, how sound radiates from a guitar, human perceptions of sound, Fourier\nmethods, and graphical representations of sound in both the time and frequency domains.\nThis chapter effectively prepares the reader for the rest of the book, and can be read\nselectively to fill any holes in his or her knowledge. It is a valuable, indeed essential,\nprovision given the diverse readership that is anticipated.\nThus prepared, the reader can move on to discussions of the structure of the guitar in\nseveral different variants, how static and dynamic loads are calculated, how the properties\nof real (non-ideal) strings combine with body vibrations to produce the sound, analytical\nmodels of the vibrations, how to calculate fret spacings, constructional and manufacturing\nmethods, discussions of the factors that determine sound quality, and the choice and mode\nof operation of electronics for electric guitars.\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 51,560-561 (2010).\nThe book is well-written, and generously illustrated with interesting black-and-white\nimages and graphs. It is unavoidably interdisciplinary involving physics, engineering,\nmathematics, history and musicology, as well as practical aspects like how to optimise\nthe choices of woods, glues and varnishes. There is an extensive list of references to\nmore specialst works on particular topics, and a good index. I have slight quibbles with\nthe ordering of some of the material, and with the use of one or two technical terms.\nFor example I looked in vain for a definition of the \u201cnut\u201d, a term that will doubtless be\ncompletely obvious to practicioners, but which may not be to others. It was seemingly\nneither explained nor illustrated in any of the diagrams of guitar parts. But this is a\ntrivial point, and a clear exception to the huge number of other technical terms that are\nvery carefully glossed. Engineering the Guitar is a unique and special addition to the\nliterature, and it deserves to be widely read. For anyone contemplating construction of a\nguitar it will surely be indispensible. Physicists and engineers with musical inclinations,\nas well as guitar players and many others, are likely to be fascinated.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\n2\n"}
