Following restoration, they are often under-utilised and one possible post-closure \nstrategy is to grow willow short rotation coppice (SRC) on them to help meet UK \nGovernment targets for renewable energy production. Although there could be a number of \nadvantages in this, yields are likely to be limited by several factors including soil \ncharacteristics (Nixon et al., 2001). This is particularly the case on Oxford clay sites where \nsoil nutrition and water are important constraints (Martin and Stephens, 2001). At these sites, \nwater availability is limited by compaction, shallow soil, low rainfall and the lack of soil \norganic matter. As a result, willow will frequently be exposed to water stress resulting in a \nsubstantial reduction in growth and biomass production (Martin and Stephens, 2005).  \n                                                 \n\u2022 1 Corresponding author.

Water use efficiency (WUE), the dry matter production per unit of water \nused, is a useful measure that incorporates both these effects. Depending on the purpose of the \ninvestigation and data available, the type of dry matter production measured to calculate \nWUE may vary and total, above-ground or economically important biomass have all been \nused while ET is often substituted for transpiration. Calculating WUE from transpiration and \nabove ground biomass production (stem plus leaf), Lindroth et al. (1994) obtained values for \nthe same stand of willow of 4.1 and 5.5 g kg-1 in two different years. They attributed the \nannual variation to differences in root:shoot partitioning. Based on these results and those of \nLindroth and Cienciala (1996), Lindroth and B\u00e4th (1999) derived a WUE of 6.3 g kg-1, based \non total biomass production and transpiration, and used this within a simple yield model to \nestimate regional SRC production in Sweden. In willow, annual (Lindroth et al., 1994) and \nclonal (Weih, 2001) variations in WUE have been demonstrated but it is not known how this \nis affected by soil factors.  \nTranspiration rates measured for willow and poplar SRC (Hall et al., 1998) are higher \nthan for any other agricultural or tree crop grown in the UK and because of its high potential \ndemand for water, there is considerable interest in the use of willow for treating high-volume \nliquid wastes (Aronsson and Bergstrom, 2001; Elowson, 1999; Ettala, 1988). On landfill sites, \nSRC could be used within a system for the remediation of landfill leachate (Brierley et al., \n2001; WRc, 2002). This will require an understanding of the factors affecting plant water use \nat these sites and the identification of those factors promoting a high seasonal water use so \nthat large volumes of leachate can be treated.  \nThe objectives of this study were to quantify water use of willow growing on Oxford \nclay, to see how this was affected by soil amendment treatments and moisture stress and to \ncompare this with plants growing on better agricultural soils. Since weighing lysimeters were \nnot used and it was not possible to prevent rain from entering them, calculation of a lysimeter \nwater balance required the quantification of stemflow and throughfall. This is also described \nin this paper.  \n2 Methods \nDetails of the experiment were given in Martin and Stephens (2005). A summary is presented \nbelow, together with additional information specific to this paper. \n2.1 Site, lysimeters and treatments \nIndividual willow plants (Salix viminalis \u201cJorr\u201d) were grown from cuttings between April \n1999 and November 2001 in lysimeters, 0.54 m in diameter and 0.9 m deep, at Cranfield \nUniversity Silsoe, Bedfordshire, UK (52oN, 0.3oW, at 60 m altitude). Plants were cut back in \nNovember 1999 and destructively harvested in November 2001. \n The experiment investigated three clay soil treatments, selected to simulate different \nlandfill cap conditions: i) compacted cap soil (1480 kg m-3; S1); ii) cap soil cultivated to \nreduce its bulk density (1270 kg m-3; S2) and iii) cultivated cap soil (1200 kg m-3) improved \nby the addition of organic matter and fertiliser (S3). For comparison with better growing \nconditions, a sandy loam soil (Cottenham series) treatment (S4) was included using the same \namendments and bulk densities as S3. Biogran (Swiss Combi Technology) was used as a \nsource of organic matter and was mixed into the top 0.1 to 0.4 m of soil of the S3 and S4 \ntreatments at a rate equivalent to 200 t ha-1. This product contains about 50% organic matter, \n3.3% total nitrogen, 4.4% total phosphorous (as P2O5) and 0.2% potassium (as K2O). In 1999 \nand 2000, single applications of nitrogen were made to treatments S3 and S4 at a rate of 200 \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 2\nkg N ha-1. In 2001, N, P and K fertilisers at 300, 150 and 90 kg ha-1, respectively, were \napplied to treatments S2, S3 and S4. The four soil treatments were represented by two \nlysimeters in each of the three replicates. \n In the lysimeters, soil water at several depths was measured on most days of the \ngrowing seasons with time domain reflectometry probes (Moisture Point MP-917, \nEnvironmental Sensors Inc.) in 1999 and 2000 and by a Diviner (Sentek Pty Ltd) capacitance \nprobe in 2001. All lysimeters were well-watered during 1999, the establishment year. Starting \nfrom 2000, one plant per replicate in each soil treatment was grown without moisture stress \nwhile the other was subjected to cycles of stress. In the unstressed treatment, threshold soil \nwater contents corresponding to a soil water potential of -0.05 MPa at 0.2 m depth were used \nfor watering. These were identified from soil water release curves as corresponding to a \nvolumetric soil water content (\u03b8v) of 47% for the clay and 27% for the sandy loam. \nLysimeters in the unstressed treatment were watered on the days that the soil probes showed \nthese thresholds had been reached. At each watering, measured quantities of water, sufficient \nto saturate the soil, were added to each lysimeter and excess was then drained off and \nmeasured over the following two days. Moisture stress was imposed on the stress treatment \nby allowing the soil water to drop to wilting point before re-watering. Wilting point was \ndetermined visually as the point when the majority of leaves on a plant started to droop. In \n2000, plants were watered on the day that wilting occurred while in 2001, watering was on the \nthird day of wilting. The soil probes indicated that wilting occurred at a \u03b8v, at 0.1 m depth, of \nabout 30% in the clay treatments and 22% in the sandy loam. At the end of the stress period, \nmeasured quantities of water, sufficient to return the soil to saturation, were added to each \nlysimeter, excess was drained off and measured and a new cycle of stress then started. Since \nrainwater could not be prevented from entering the lysimeters, the imposition of the moisture \nstress treatment was dependent on the occurrence of rain-free periods. During 2000, 11 cycles \nof soil drying were imposed on the S3 and S4 treatments and 6 in 2001; fewer cycles were \nimposed on plants in the S1 and S2 treatments because they used water more slowly and \ndrying cycles were more often interrupted by rain. In figures and tables the two watering \ntreatments are referred to as NS (no stress) and S (stress). \n The experiment used a randomised complete block design with three replicates. In \neach replicate, one of the 8 treatments (4 soils x 2 watering regimes) was allocated to each \nlysimeter. Since no moisture stress treatment was applied in the first year, each soil treatment \nwas represented by two lysimeters per replicate in this year. In the second and third years, \neach replicate contained a single lysimeter with each treatment. The moisture stress treatment \nwas applied to the same lysimeters in 2001 as in 2000. \n2.2 Plant measurements \nDuring the growing seasons, stem diameter was measured monthly to allow the calculation of \nstem basal area (SBA). Stem dry mass was determined from allometric relationships with \nSBA (Martin and Stephens, 2005).  \n During 2000 and 2001, plant leaf area was estimated monthly from relationships \nbetween SBA and stem leaf area. In July 2000 and 2001, two measurements were made of \nmaximum plant canopy diameter in a North-South and East-West direction. The average of \nthese was used to calculate the projected ground cover area for each plant, assuming this was \na circle. The maximum leaf area index (LAI) for each plant was then calculated by dividing \nits maximum leaf area by its canopy ground cover area. Plant leaf area duration (LAD) was \ncalculated from the sum of each plant\u2019s leaf area on each day of the growing season. It was \nassumed that there was a linear change in leaf area between measurement dates.  \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 3\n Root dry mass was estimated from soil samples collected from the lysimeters of fine \n(<2 mm diameter) and coarse root (>2 mm diameter).  \n2.3 Stemflow, throughfall, canopy interception and ET \nDuring 2001, rain entering the lysimeters was quantified as stemflow and throughfall. \nStemflow was measured on 13 stems across the range of stem diameters found on plants (5 to \n23 mm in April 2001). Plastic collars were made from funnels of 35 and 70 mm diameter. \nHoles, slightly larger than the stem diameter, were drilled in the wall of the funnel next to the \nspout and the funnel wall was then slit from the rim to the new hole. The funnel walls were \ntrimmed down to collars of 10 mm and then fitted around stems at about 0.25 m above their \nbase. They were secured in place with wire clips and all joints sealed with waterproof silicon \nsealant. Plastic tubing connected the spout to a vented collecting bottle (0.25 to 4.0 l, \ndepending on stem size). In each lysimeter, all the stems on a plant originated from the stump \nwhich was located in the centre of the lysimeter. All the stemflow from all the stems on a \nplant therefore entered the lysimeter and this is what was calculated for inclusion in equation \n3 to determine each lysimeter\u2019s water balance.  \n Throughfall was measured under the eight trees in one replicate by placing a single \ncollector on the soil surface of each lysimeter, half-way between the willow stump and the \nlysimeter wall. Collectors were made from 1.0 l plastic bottles which had a hole drilled in \ntheir side into which the spout of a 115 mm diameter funnel was inserted through a rubber \nbung. The plastic bottle was fixed to the ground with a metal peg so that the rim of the funnel \nwas horizontal. To calculate a lysimeter water balance (equation 3), only the amount of \nthroughfall entering a lysimeter needed to be known and this was calculated as the quantity \nwhich fell on an area equivalent to that of the lysimeter\u2019s soil surface (0.23 m2). In the \nremainder of this paper, this will be referred to as lysimeter throughfall (TL), to avoid \nconfusion with throughfall received under the entire tree canopy, which will be referred to as \ntotal throughfall (TT). \n Stemflow, throughfall and rainfall were recorded over 24 h periods ending at 0900 \neach day. Rainfall was the average of four measurements from 100 mm rain gauges located \nbetween lysimeters within the experimental site. Data were collected for 52 days on which \nrain occurred between 26th April and 18th October. Relationships determined in 2001 and \ndescribed below were used to partition rainfall, recorded at the Cranfield University Silsoe \nmeteorological site (0.5 km away from the trial) into stemflow and throughfall in the \npreceding two seasons. This was possible because appropriate canopy and stem measurements \nhad been made through each growing season, thereby allowing differences in plant size to be \ndealt with. \n ET was calculated for each lysimeter from a simple water balance: \nET = St + TL + I \u2013 D (3) \nWhere St, TL and I respectively, are water entering the lysimeter as stemflow (l), throughfall \n(l) and irrigation (l) and D is water drained from the lysimeter (l). In this case, ET includes \nsoil evaporation but excludes rain intercepted and evaporated from the canopy. \nFor comparison with ET, reference crop ET (ETo) was calculated from the Penman- \nMonteith combination equation (Smith, 1991) using data from the Cranfield University Silsoe \nmeteorological site. \nCanopy interception for each plant was calculated as the difference between gross and \nnet precipitation. Net precipitation is the sum of total throughfall (TT) and stemflow reaching \nthe ground beneath a plant canopy. To calculate TT, the measurements of throughfall and \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 4\ncanopy ground cover area were used to determine the amount of throughfall reaching an area \nof ground equivalent to the canopy ground cover area of each plant. This was then added to \neach plant\u2019s stemflow. Gross precipitation was calculated as the rain falling on an area of \nground equal to each tree\u2019s canopy ground cover area.  \n2.4 Data analysis \nData were analysed using Genstat 5 \u2013 Release 4.1 (NAG Ltd, Oxford). Measurements from \nthe lysimeter experiment in 1999 were analysed using a one-way ANOVA in randomised \nblocks while a two-way ANOVA in randomised blocks was used for the 2000 and 2001 \nmeasurements. Where repeated measurements were made through a season or over several \nseasons, separate ANOVAs were performed on the data from each measurement occasion. \nThe statistical significance of main effects was determined from F ratios in the ANOVA table \nwhile that between treatment pairs was tested with the Student t-test using the appropriate \nstandard error of the difference between means. A 5% significance level was adopted for \nidentifying significant treatment effects. \n 6.0 mm stem\ny = 0.009x1.353\nr 2  = 0.76\n19.1 mm stem\ny = 0.026x1.458\nr 2  = 0.87\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n0 5 10 15\nRainfall (mm)\nSt\nem\nflo\nw\n (l\n)\n6.0 mm stem 19.1 mm stem\n  \nFigure 1 .The relationship between stemflow and rainfall for two willow stems of different diameter.For \nthe 13 stems, stemflow values predicted by calculating values for a and e from equations 5 and 6 and \ninserting these in equation 4 accounted for 85% of the variation in actual stemflow values. The same \nprocedure was used to estimate stemflow for all stems on all experimental plants. \n3 Results \n3.1 Canopy diameter \nMeasurements of canopy diameter were used to calculate canopy ground cover area. This was \nthen used to determine LAI which was in turn used to derive relationships for calculating \nlysimeter throughfall (section 3.3) and total throughfall for determining canopy interception \n(section 3.4). Table 1 shows the variation of canopy diameter in soil and moisture stress \ntreatments in 2000 and 2001. In both years, it was significantly affected by the soil treatments, \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 5\nbeing greatest in the S4 treatment and decreasing in the other treatments in the order \nS3>S2>S1. Canopy diameter was not significantly affected by moisture stress, although it \ntended to be slightly less in most of the stress treatments. \nTable 1.

A power relationship was fitted to the data: \nSt = aXe   (4) \nWhere St is stemflow (l), a and e are constants and X is rainfall (mm). The relationship \nbetween stemflow and rainfall was described better by a power than a linear relationship and \nvaried significantly between stems. Averaged over all stems, it accounted for 82% of the \nvariation in stemflow over the season (range 76 to 87%). Figure 1 shows the lines fitted to one \nof the smallest and largest stems. The lines for the other stems fell between these two.  \nFor each stem, relationships were investigated between the constants a and e in \nequation 4 and measured stem characteristics. a was found to be most highly correlated with \nSBA in October (SBAOct) and e with the natural logarithm of stem leaf area in September \n(Ln(LASep)): \na = 4.206(SBAOct) + 2.425 (5) \n(s.e. of the regression coefficient and constant, 0.234 and 0.739, respectively; r2 = 0.96) \ne = 0.078(Ln(LASep)) + 0.798 (6) \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 6\n(s.e. of the regression coefficient and constant, 0.012 and 0.079, respectively; r2 = 0.79)  \nPlant 20\ny = 1.00x\nr 2  = 0.99\nPlant 18\ny = 0.80x\nr 2  = 0.97\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18\nRainfall (mm)\nTh\nro\nug\nhf\nal\nl (\nm\nm\n)\nPlant 18 Plant 20\n \nFigure 2. The relationship between throughfall and rainfall for one of the most vigorous \n(18) and least vigorous (20) plants. \n3.3 Throughfall \nFor all eight plants on which throughfall was measured, there were highly significant linear \nrelationships between throughfall and rainfall but there were significant differences in the \nrelationship between plants. The intercept was not significantly different from zero for any \nplant and, to facilitate fitting the relationship to plant characteristics, lines were therefore \nforced through the origin. This made virtually no difference to the coefficients of \ndetermination and, averaged over all plants, rainfall accounted for 97% of the observed \nvariation in throughfall. Figure 2 shows the relationship fitted to data for plants with the \nlargest (S4) and smallest (S1) leaf areas. Throughfall for the latter was very similar to rainfall \nwhile for the former it was usually less. The fitted lines for the other plants fell between these \ntwo.  \nWhen the slopes of the lines for the relationships between throughfall and rainfall \nwere investigated in relation to measured canopy characteristics (leaf area, LAI and plant \nSBA). The greatest amount of variation was accounted for by LAI in July (LAIjly): \nY = -0.118X + 1.027 (7) \nwhere Y is the slope of the relationship between rainfall and throughfall, and X is LAIjly (s.e. of the \nregression coefficient and constant, 0.009 and 0.011, respectively; r2 = 0.96). \nWhen slopes for the relationship between throughfall and rainfall were calculated for \nall eight plants from equation 7 and used to predict throughfall, 97% of the variation in the \nactual values was accounted for. The same procedure was used to calculate throughfall for the \nremaining experimental plants. \nThe amount of throughfall entering a lysimeter (TL) was calculated as the amount \nfalling on its soil surface. For the 2001 growing season, this was estimated to decrease \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 7\ngradually in the order S1>S2>S3>S4. In contrast, stemflow increased exponentially in the \nsame order so that in S4 plants it was more than ten times greater than in S1 plants (Figure 3). \nThe large amounts of stemflow in the S4 and S3 plants resulted from the greater number of \nlarge stems in these treatments than in the other treatments. Figure 3 also shows the \ncontribution of irrigation and drainage to the lysimeter water balance of each treatment during \n2001. \n-300\n-100\n100\n300\n500\n700\n900\nS1 S S1 NS S2 S S2 NS S3 S S3 NS S4 S S4 NS\nTreatment\nW\nat\ner\n e\nnt\ner\nin\ng \nor\n d\nra\nin\nin\ng \n(l \nly\nsi\nm\net\ner\n-1\n) \nThroughfall Stemflow Irrigation Drainage\n \nFigure 3.

Bars indicate the standard error of each \nmean. \n3.4 Canopy interception \nAs a percentage of gross precipitation over the 2001 season, canopy interception varied from \nbeing very little in trees with the lowest LAI to a maximum of about 7% in trees with the \nhighest LAI (Figure 4). \n3.5 ET \nIn all years there were significant differences in annual ET between soil treatments and it \ndecreased in the order S4>S3>S2>S1 (Error! Reference source not found.). This order \nreflects treatment differences in plant leaf area, canopy diameter and stem biomass \nproduction. In 2000 and 2001, moisture stress also significantly affected annual ET which \nwas reduced in stressed plants by 10 - 14% in 2000 and 25 - 41% in 2001. The greater \nreduction during 2001 reflects the use of a more severe stress treatment which resulted in a \nlonger exposure to stress and larger reductions in leaf area because of defoliation. In all \ntreatments, except the S1, there was a progressive increase in annual ET from year to year. \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 8\nThus, for the S4 NS treatment, this increased from 359 l plant-1 in 1999 to 868 l plant-1 in \n2000 and 1192 l plant-1 in 2001. \ny = 3.01x + 1.12\nr 2  = 0.71\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nMaximum LAI (m2 m-2)\nIn\nte\nrc\nep\ntio\nn \n(%\n)\nS1, NS S1, S\nS2, NS S2, S\nS3, NS S3, S\nS4, NS S4, S\n \nFigure 4.

Bars indicate the standard error of the difference between means at the end of \neach season (18 df in 1999 and 14 df in 2000 and 2001). \nFigure 6 shows the seasonal pattern of ETo and ET for stressed and unstressed plants \nin the S1, S3 and S4 treatments in 2001. These data were obtained by calculating short-term \nlysimeter water balances at the end of each irrigation event. Most ET occurred between June \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 9\nand September (67% of seasonal ET for S1 and 78% for the other treatments). In unstressed \nplants, maximum rates of ET occurred towards the end of July and were 1.4, 5.6, 7.3 and 13.6 \nl day-1 in treatments S1, S2, S3 and S4 respectively. Maximum rates coincided with near \nmaximum leaf areas and slightly after the maximum ETo values. ET declined rapidly through \nAugust and early September and this appeared to be related more to the fall in ETo than to the \ndecline in leaf area. In 2000, maximum rates of ET occurred slightly later, in August, and \nwere 5.2 and 8.8 l plant-1 day-1 for unstressed plants in treatments S3 and S4 respectively. In \nall treatments in 2001, ET was considerably lower in stressed plants from June to August than \nin unstressed plants. \nLinear regression analysis showed that seasonal ET was highly correlated with LAD \nin both 2000 and 2001. There were, however, significant differences between years and, \nwithin years, between the water stress treatments (Figure 7) such that for a given LAD, ET \nwas lower for stressed plants. \nTable 2.

For WUE(stem), \nthere was a significant effect of soil in all years and WUE(stem) values generally decreased in \nthe order S4>S3>S2>S1. There was a marked increase in the WUE(stem) of S2 plants in 2001 \nfollowing the application of fertiliser to this treatment but in the other treatments WUE(stem) \nwas highest in 2000, the season after cut-back.  \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 10\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nMay-01 Jun-01 Jul-01 Aug-01 Sep-01\nDate\nET\n o\nr E\nTo\n (l\n p\nla\nnt\n-1\n)\nS1 NS, ET S1 S, ET ETo\n(A)\n \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nMay-01 Jun-01 Jul-01 Aug-01 Sep-01\nDate\nET\n o\nr E\nTo\n (l\n p\nla\nnt\n-1\n)\nS3 NS,ET S3 S,ET ETo\n(B)\n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nMay-01 Jun-01 Jul-01 Aug-01 Sep-01\nDate\nET\n o\nr E\nTo\n (l\n p\nla\nnt\n-1\n)\nS4 NS,ET S4 S,ET ETo\n(C)\n \nFigure 6.

In \nmost of the unstressed soil treatments it increased annually over the first three years. In the \nsecond and third season, ET was 2.4 and 3.3 times that of the year of establishment in the \nunstressed S4 treatments. Within years, seasonal ET was always highest in the sandy loam \n(S4) treatment, followed by the Oxford clay treatments in the order S3> S2> S1. The \nimportant role of leaf area in determining water use is shown by the very significant \nrelationships within watering treatments between seasonal ET and LAD (Figure 7). Previous \nresults demonstrated that the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers to willow on \nOxford clay resulted in substantial increases in leaf area and growth (Martin and Stephens, \n2005). Similar increases have been shown here in ET, the clearest example of this being the \nmuch higher rates in plants of the S2 unstressed treatment relative to those in S1 during 2001 \nafter the application of fertiliser (Error! Reference source not found.). Nutritional \namendment of the S3 treatment, however, did not result in the same vigorous growth and ET \nas similarly amended plants in the S4, sandy loam treatment. This probably reflects a lack of \naccess to nutrients added to the clay, either because of poor soil aeration or mineralisation and \nleaching (Martin and Stephens, 2005).  \nWater stress reduced plant leaf area by causing the premature loss of older leaves and \nthis partly explains the lower LAD and seasonal ET of these plants. In addition, however, the \nslope of the line fitted to the relationship between ET and LAD (Figure 7) was lower in \nstressed plants, suggesting lower average transpiration rates per unit leaf area. This was also \nindicated by the short-term water balance data when expressed on a leaf area basis. Thus, for \nthe unstressed S3 and S4 plants, the ET rates averaged about 1.4 (S4) and 1.5 l m-2 d-1 (S3) in \nJuly while in stressed plants they were about 0.8 (S4) and 1.2 l m-2 d-1 (S3). This probably \nresulted from stress-induced stomatal closure (Kozlowski, 1982). In the S4 treatment, about \n60% of the reduction in seasonal ET in the stressed treatments could be attributed to stomatal \ncontrol of water use with the remaining 40% due to a reduction in leaf area (Figure 7). Since \nthe willow plants in this experiment were not part of a continuous dense canopy they were \nprobably well coupled with the atmosphere throughout the season. Control of \nevapotranspiration would therefore be more dependent on stomatal conductance than on the \nboundary layer resistance. In willow stands with extensive closed canopies, where ET is \nclosely related to incoming solar radiation, LAD would be expected to be the major factor \ncontrolling ET (Perttu and Kowalik, 1989). \nIn mid-July, when canopy shading would have reduced soil evaporation, the \nmaximum rate of evapotranspiration for the S4 treatment (13.6 l plant-1 day-1) was only \nslightly more than that (13.1 l plant-1 day-1) estimated over a similar period (13 July to 3 \nAugust) from sapflow measurements (Seymour, 2002 personal communication). At this time, \ntherefore, the peak ET rates for the S4 and S3 treatments can mostly be attributed to \ntranspiration and, on a leaf area basis, are equivalent to about 1.5 l m-2 d-1 which is towards \nthe upper end of a range of values (0.5 to 1.8 l m-2 d-1) given by Kramer and Boyer (1995) for \n16 tree species growing in the United States. Willow transpiration has been measured by other \nresearchers using sap flow techniques. In the UK, Hall et al. (1998) found mean daily \ntranspiration rates of about 6 mm d-1 for poplar and willow SRC during June and July 1995. \nThe mean flux, about 2.0 l m-2 d-1, is larger than the maximum values for S3 and S4 \nunstressed plants reported here, but might be attributable to the particularly hot and dry \nconditions of 1995 and to the type of material used for measurements \u2013 three-year old stems \non four-year old stumps of the clone \u201cGermany\u201d (Salix burjatica). For small willow trees in \nSweden, Lindroth et al. (1995) calculated maximum daily rates in July and August of 1.2-1.6 l \nplant-1 d-1. The average SBA of these trees was only 7.1 cm2, however, indicating that they \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 13\nwere slightly larger than those in the S1 treatment (6.5 cm2 in November 2001). Allowing for \nthis, our maximum rates for S1 unstressed plants of about 1.5 l plant-1 d-1 are similar, but \ninclude soil evaporation.  \nMajor differences were seen in WUE(stem) between years and soil treatments. In most \ntreatments, WUE(stem) values were highest in 2000. This may have resulted from the transfer \nof assimilates from roots after cutting stems back at the end of the 1999 growing season. \nExceptions to this were the two S2 treatments which had highest WUE(stem) values in 2001 \nafter receiving fertiliser. The low values of WUE(stem) in all treatments in 1999 probably \nresulted from soil evaporation being a proportionately larger part of ET in this year. This \nwould be expected because canopy development in the year of establishment is later and less \nthan in the following years and this would have resulted in less shading of the soil and hence \ngreater soil evaporation. This would also explain the very low WUE(stem) of treatment S1 in \nall years and the higher WUE(stem) of the S2 treatment in 2001 than in the first two years. In \nspite of the nutritional amendment, the WUE(stem) of the S3 treatment was less than that of \nthe S4 in all three years. This was because proportionately less dry mass was allocated to \nstems and more to roots in plants in the clay than in the sandy loam (Martin and Stephens, \n2005). When WUE(plant) was calculated, there was no difference between the two \ntreatments. Stressed plants also distributed proportionately more dry mass to roots than to \nshoots so that WUE(stem) was generally lower in stressed than unstressed plants but \nWUE(plant) was very similar, or even higher, in stressed plants. Differences in dry matter \npartitioning between the root and shoot also resulted in significant differences in WUE of \nMiscanthus genotypes when calculated on a shoot basis while none existed at the whole plant \nlevel (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000). These results show the importance, for \nwillow breeders, in considering dry matter partitioning when selecting new clones. Selection \nfor high WUE(stem) or high stem biomass may produce clones which yield well when water \nis readily available, but these clones may not be suited to dry conditions if stem production is \nachieved at the expense of root growth. \nUnder similar conditions to those of the S4 treatment, slightly lower WUE(plant) \nvalues (3.56 to 4.71 g kg-1) have been found for 5 hybrid willow clones (\u201cTora\u201d, \u201cAshton \nStott\u201d, \u201cResolution\u201d, \u201cEndurance\u201d and LA980289) growing with and without water stress in \nlysimeters at Silsoe (Bonneau, 2005). The lower values may have been because the hybrid \nclones were one year younger when they were harvested. Bonneau (2005) found significant \nclonal differences in WUE(plant) but none as a result of stress.  \nUnder the conditions of the present experiment where tall, spreading, multi-stemmed \nwillow plants in the S3 and S4 treatments were grown in lysimeters with a relatively small \nprojected surface area, stemflow was shown to make a particularly large contribution to the \nlysimeter water balance. Willow SRC has several characteristics which favour high stemflow \nrates (Crockford and Richardson, 2000): a high density of near-vertical stems; branches and \nleaves angled well above the horizontal; and smooth bark. In contrast, lysimeter throughfall \n(TL) was much less important, but only because of the small soil surface area of the \nlysimeters. If, however, stemflow is compared with total throughfall (TT) \u2013 which would be \nthe normal comparison for stand-level studies of SRC - stemflow becomes less important. In \nthis case, it varied from 8% (S1) to 17% (S4) of gross precipitation and TT from 75% (S4) to \n91% (S1) while net precipitation varied from 93% (S4) to 99% (S1) of gross precipitation. \nThese values are larger than generally found for stands of trees. For willow SRC, Ettala \n(1988) reported stemflow and TT as 2% and 67%, respectively, of gross precipitation while \nHall et al. (1996) estimated the two components to be 79% for a stand of poplar SRC in the \nUK. It is likely that the difference between these estimates and those in the present study can \nbe attributed to the latter being for individual trees rather than a stand and to the low LAI of \nMartin & Stephens 2005b (II Water Use) 14\nthese trees which varied from 0.25 (S1) to 1.8 (S4). Similarly high net rainfall (92%) was \nreported for widely spaced olive trees (Olea europaea Linn.) in Spain with a LAI of 1.1 \n(Gomez et al., 2001) while for Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr) in the UK, \nTeklehaimanot et al. (1991) found net precipitation depended on tree spacing and increased \nfrom 67% to 91% as spacing increased from 2 to 8 m.  \nIn a previous paper (Martin and Stephens, 2005), it was shown that soil nutritional \ndeficiencies and water stress can cause large reductions in biomass production by willow on \nOxford clay. Furthermore, the low values for WUE(stem) shown in the present study indicate \nthat, to achieve a given level of biomass production, willow on Oxford clay will also use more \nwater than plants on better soil. These factors are serious constraints if willow is being grown \nsolely for biomass, but not if it is being grown within a leachate management system where \nbiomass is a by-product and a major objective is high water use. In this case, irrigation with \nleachate would remove the constraint of water stress while the nitrogen and phosphorus in the \nleachate (DOE, 1995) would remedy the Oxford clay\u2019s nutrient deficiencies, promoting a high \nleaf area and high seasonal ET. Beneficial effects of leachate on the growth of willow on \nOxford clay have already been demonstrated (Brierley et al., 2001). Such a system could \nadopt a number of cultural practices to encourage high water use. For example, using close \nspacing, selecting planting designs which encourage advection, atmospheric coupling and a \nhigh crop coefficient (Stephens et al., 2001), siting the SRC in exposed areas and selecting \nclones with a high water use. Clones and husbandry could also be managed to achieve a high \nLAI early in the season in order to maximise radiation interception (Cannell et al., 1987) and \ntake advantage of the high rates of potential ET from June to August. In spite of the \nadvantages of such a system, there are a number of issues to be resolved before such a system \ncan be implemented on Oxford clay (Martin et al., 2002). One major practical constraint is \nthat wet and sticky soil conditions leave only narrow windows of opportunity for performing \ncritical SRC operations such as planting and harvesting. In the long-term, there is also \nconcern about the sustainability of such a system, particularly because of increases in soil \nsalinity over the irrigation period and the loss of salts from the soil over the winter. \n5 Acknowledgements \nThis project was financed by the shanks first fund.
