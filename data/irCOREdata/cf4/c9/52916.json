The two main geoengineering\noptions are limiting incoming solar radiation, or modifying the\ncarbon cycle. Here we examine the impact of five geoengineering\napproaches on sea level; SO2 aerosol injection into the strato-\nsphere, mirrors in space, afforestation, biochar, and bioenergy with\ncarbon sequestration. Sea level responds mainly at centennial time\nscales to temperature change, and has been largely driven by\nanthropogenic forcing since 1850.

Loss of low-lying land (2),\ncombined with asset exposure to urban flooding due to the com-\nbined effects of climate change (sea-level rise and increased stor-\nminess), (3), may reach 10% of projected global gross world\nproduct (GWP) in the 2070\u2019s. Geoengineering has been proposed\nas an emergency treatment for climate change (4), though it re-\nmains highly controversial with huge scientific and international\ngovernance issues (5\u20137) to be resolved. Hence the sea-level re-\nsponse to geoengineering proposals is of considerable practical\nas well as ethical and technical interest.\nPotential geoengineering options can be divided into two\nbroad categories. Possibly the easiest to realize are those that rely\non decreasing temperatures by blocking incoming solar radiation\nor increasing albedo,\u2014so-called Solar Radiation Management\u2014\nwhich would balance the radiative impact of increasing green-\nhouse gasses, though not address the chemical or biological con-\nsequences of greenhouse gasses. The second category of solutions\naddresses the temperature issue and the chemistry together by\nmodifying\u2014or seeking to reverse\u2014the anthropogenic change\nin the global carbon cycle. In effect lowering the CO2 concentra-\ntion of the atmosphere. Geoengineering is controversial and its\nbroader impacts have been relatively little investigated. Of the\nmany geoengineering options proposed in the literature (7, 8)\nonly relatively few have a clear impact while being energetically\nand financially reasonable\u2014in so far as any geoengineering pro-\nject may be thought of as feasible. Here we present simulations of\n21st century global sea level resulting from both geoengineered\nreduction in solar insolation and modification of the atmospheric\ncarbon reservoir. We select examples of low cost methods\u2014affor-\nestation and sulphate aerosol injection, and much more expensive\nand ambitious projects\u2014such as mirrors in space, and attempt to\nmodel reasonable scenarios of their development and effective-\nness over the 21st century.\nRecent work on sea-level rise from a variety of approaches\nsuggests that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) 2007 estimates (9) for 2100 (0.18\u20130.59 m) are too low,\nwith several authors suggesting a rise of 1\u20131.5 m this century\n(e.g., 10\u201313). Detailed analysis of past sea-level rise shows that\nthe time constants for global ocean heat content (affecting vo-\nlume change contributions) and ice sheet melting (affecting mass\ncontributions) are likely centennial (11). Slower time constants\ndo not capture the increase in sea level during the 20th century\nobserved after the end of the Little Ice Age (11), and decadal\nscale response times are unrealistic for ocean dynamics (14).\nFurthermore recent analysis of past sea level attribution shows\nthat anthropogenic factors dominated sea-level rise since 1850\n(15), with deforestation being important before significant emis-\nsions from fossil fuel burning.\nOne consequence of the early anthropogenically driven sea-\nlevel rise, and its centennial response time is that there will be\nonly a slow response of sea-level rise to drops in global tempera-\nture envisaged by the geoengineering scenarios outlined above.\nThis response is confirmed using a linear response model that\nhas been successfully used to reconstruct the past 1,000 years\nof sea-level variability due to changes in climate forcings (15)\nand for projections of sea-level rise by 2100 by changes in natural\nand anthropogenic climate forcings (13). We show that the model\nalso gives realistic responses to volcanic eruptions on multiyear\ntime scales (seeMethods section and Fig. 1), hence the model fits\nobservations spanning multiyear to multicentennial scales.\nResults and Discussion\nRadiation Management Solutions. Robock et al. (6) use a climate\nsystem model to show that injections of 5\u201310 Mt SO2 aerosol\nper year (equivalent to a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every 4\u20132 yr)\ninto the atmosphere would lower mean global temperatures by\n1 \u00b0C or more with virtually immediate effect (1\u20132 yr).

A more expensive but possibly\nless damaging proposal involves use of mirrors in space to reduce\ndirect radiation (17)\u2014about 2% lower insolation offsetting a\ndoubling of CO2. There are several other ways of reducing solar\nradiation such as cloud whitening and surface albedo modifica-\ntion (e.g., 7). These approaches are relatively localized in their\neffects and considerably more unknown in impact on weather sys-\ntems than the global reduction in radiation schemes, though our\nmain findings will be applicable to these approaches as well.\nThe radiative forcing projections fromRepresentative Concen-\ntration Pathways (RCPs, 18) do not take explicitly into account\nmodification by geoengineering, but some with low radiative\nforcing implicitly include carbon removal and sequestration. Here\nwe simulate the impact of both stratospheric SO2 injection and\nreduction of radiation by reflecting mirrors since forcings include\ntotal solar irradiance (TSI) and volcanism terms (Fig. 2). The SO2\naerosol required to counteract the radiative forcing due to a\ndoubling of atmospheric CO2 depends on the size of the particles\nand the location of injection. Models indicate that the continuous\ninjection of SO2 would produce larger particles than a natural\nvolcanic eruption, which then sediment faster out of the strato-\nsphere reducing their effective cooling capability (19). The radia-\ntive impact of the Pinatubo eruption over the following four years\nare \u22121.29, \u22121.59, and \u22121.89 Wm\u22122 depending on which forcing\nreconstruction model is used (20\u201322). Since a doubling of CO2\nmust be countered by about 4 Wm\u22122 (23), it appears likely that\nat least the equivalent of a Pinatubo SO2 injection every 1\u20132 years\nwould be needed.\nWe modeled the radiative effect of stratospheric injections of\nSO2 aerosol equivalent to a Pinatubo eruption every 4 years for\nthe 21st century by imposing a uniform step of \u22121.56 Wm\u22122 (the\nmean from the 3 forcing reconstructions we use) beginning in\n2010 on the RCP3PD, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 radiative forcing\nscenarios (18), Fig. 3. This method effectively removes the need\nfor making model-dependent aerosol\u2014radiative forcing calcula-\ntions; however the details of the radiative impact will depend on\nthe actual geographic location of the injection, and the size and\nnature of the particles (6, 19).\nThe first space mirror we model will reduce radiative forcing\nby 4 Wm\u22122 by 2100 and is of linearly increasing effectiveness,\nconstrained by the logistics of placing, and keeping about 20\nmillion tonnes in the correct location in space (17). This scenario\nis an arbitrary but simple and illustrative assumption of mirror\ndevelopment. Results of scenarios show (Fig. 3) that sea-level rise\nwill continue, though at slightly reduced rates (about 30 cm lower\nthan otherwise by 2100 for SO2 injections, and 39 cm lower for\nthe space mirror). Sea level peaks by 2100 in RCP3PD and\nRCP4.5 scenarios for the mirror, but just about stabilized by\n2100 with aerosol injection only in the RCP3PD scenario, at\n24 cm above 200 levels. In the RCP8.5 scenarios median sea-level\nFig. 1.

This\nmass is comparable with that already lifted close to the tropo-\npause by commercial aircraft each year, and hence relatively\neasily realized by various existing methods (5), though it is has\nnot been demonstrated that a permanent aerosol cloud at all\nlatitudes with the correct size distribution to be effective (19)\ncan be created. Fig. 4 shows that such an immediate reduction\nin insolation produces dramatic lowering of sea level for several\ndecades in all scenarios, hence sea level can be effectively kept\nclose to the 1990 level with this intensive SO2 injection scenario.\nHowever, in RCP8.5 scenario, sea level starts to rise again by mid\nto late 21st century and is 24 cm above 2000 levels by 2100. We\nalso consider a space mirror deployed with efficiency rising by\n1 Wm\u22122 per decade from 2010. Fig. 4 shows that the space mirror\nso deployed produces a 21st century peak in sea level under all\nIPCC scenarios of nomore than about 20 cm, with falls in sea level\nrelative to present by 2100 in RCP3PD and RCP4.5 scenarios.\nCarbon Cycle Modification. We discuss three alternatives that all\nrely on biological mechanisms to remove CO2 from air and then\nstore the captured carbon either in vegetation biomass, in soils,\nor in geological storage sites. Afforestation sequesters carbon in\nthe biomass of trees. Biochar is produced by pyrolysis of organic\nmaterial, converting roughly 50% of the carbon to charcoal,\nwhich can then be added to soils (the rest produces CO2 which\ncan also be captured and stored). Bioenergy with carbon storage\n(BECS) refers to a variety of biomass and biofuel options such\nas forestry, sugar cane, or switchgrass production, followed by\ncapture and storage of the CO2 produced in the process of fer-\nmenting fuels and in combustion, followed by carbon storage.\nChemical capture from ambient air is also possible, though this\nrequires an energy source, hence using bioenergy seems to offer\nsome cost-benefit advantages. In terms of the net removal, both\nambient air capture and BECS offer large potential in controlling\natmospheric CO2, and can even potentially reduce CO2 concen-\ntrations to preindustrial levels. Oceanic carbon cycle measures\nsuch as chemical fertilization schemes or physical modification\nof oceanic convection have also been proposed, however reviews\n(7, 8) conclude that they are likely to be less effective than ter-\nrestrial carbon cycle modification using biological methods, and\npotentially pose much higher risks.\nCarbon sequestration over the 21st century as a result of the\nthree carbon cycle geoengineering projects was investigated by\nLenton and Vaughan (8), and we follow their scenarios here.\nTo produce scenarios of CO2 variations in air we use the Bern\ncarbon model (24) assuming that the perturbations caused by\ngeoengineering are sufficiently small to leave the exchange pro-\ncesses between atmosphere, biosphere, and oceans unchanged.\nRadiative forcings due to changes in CO2 concentration are then\ncomputed using a near log-linear relationship described in ref. 23\nand then these are added to the RCP radiative forcing scenarios\n(Fig. 2). The scheme implies that a doubling of CO2 con-\ncentration over preindustrial corresponds to 4.1 Wm\u22122.\nAfforestation and reforestation in the scenario we follow\nallows about a 45 ppm atmospheric CO2 lowering by 2060, which\nby then would represent a newly existing forest biomass equal to\nall previous loses by land use change, so it is unlikely to be able to\nproduce further reductions. However, there are many potential\nbenefits from afforestation such as ecosystem richness, water\nmanagement, and social amenities that affect the cost-benefit\nanalysis of this method. Biochar is modeled as rising exponen-\ntially in use from 2035 through the rest of the century producing\na monotonic reduction in atmospheric CO2 amounting to about\n35 ppm by 2100 with similar radiative impact as afforestation\n(Fig 2). This scenario assumes that biofuels are rapidly developed\nand that suitable agricultural practices can be developed to\naccommodate large biochar use on land. BECS or air capture\nis by far the largest potential reduction mechanism (Fig. 2).\nWe follow the aggressive scenario outlined by Lenton and\nVaughan (8) with fermentation starting in 2020 and CO2 capture\nfrom flue gases in 2025, added to an assumption that biofuels\ndisplace oil as the major transport fuels and biomass burning\ndisplaces a significant amount of the coal used in electricity pro-\nduction by 2060. Furthermore the measures could be amplified\nsince there are plenty of geological reservoirs available for sto-\nrage, so that in the Lenton and Vaughan (8) scenario atmos-\npheric CO2 is lowered by 180 ppm by 2100 with radiative forcing\nof about \u22123.1 Wm\u22122 (Fig 2).\nBECS can then reduce sea-level rise by about 20 cm compared\nwith RCP scenarios by 2100 (Fig. 5). Combining afforestation\nwith biochar and BECS scenarios (and ignoring potential\noverlaps in land use and energy policy) leads to massive reduc-\ntions of about 250 ppm in atmospheric CO2, and, sea-level rise is\nlimited to 22 cm with the RCP3PD and 38 cm with the RCP4.5\nscenarios (Fig. 5).\nConclusions\nModerate geoengineering options, can constrain sea-level rise to\nabout 50 cm above 2000 levels in the RCP3PD and RCP4.5 sce-\nnarios but only aggressive geoengneering can similarly constrain\nthe RCP8.5 scenario (Figs 3, 4, and 5). The widely discussed SO2\ninjection scheme seems to offer only 20 cm reductions in sea level\n\u2014at least if injections are limited to the quantities modeled by\nFig. 4.

However if large quantities of SO2\u2014equivalent\nto almost a Pinatubo per year (and probably more since particles\nare expected to grow, reducing their effectiveness)\u2014are injected,\nsea level drops for several decades until the mid 21st century be-\nfore starting to rise again (Fig. 4). The solar mirror and aggressive\nBECS or air capture would likely be reasonably effective, though\nof course the solar mirror does not address the chemical impact\nof CO2 loading. Afforestation, while being meretricious on\necological and other grounds does not offer significant sea-level\nreduction.\nModel Limitations.The sea-level rise due to greenhouse gases, and\nthe reductions due to geoengineering both depend on the model\nused, hence the balance should be relatively insensitive to the sea-\nlevel model. Some confidence may be gained from the compar-\nable results found by models which use different statistical models\nbased on different reconstructions of past sea level with tempera-\nture as a parameter (10\u201312), and also using radiative forcing (13).\nHowever, the regression models are based on past sea level and\nclimate hence projections and confidence levels may be system-\natically in error. The Grinsted et al. (11) model of sea-level de-\npendence on global temperature suggests that a fall of 0.6 \u00b0C was\nneeded to halt sea-level rise. This decrease is also physically plau-\nsible as a reduction in temperature from present day values would\nbe needed to reverse the presently observed dynamic response of\nglaciers and ice sheets (25). However, Irvine et al. (26) use a sim-\nple ice sheet model of Greenland driven by a climate model that\nsuggests geoengineering in the presence of rising CO2 emissions\nmay lead to nonlinear ice sheet response with unexpected stability\nregimes. The thermal inertia of the ocean and sea-level system\nhowever mean that sea level will lag behind temperature stabiliz-\ning efforts by decades or more. More complete ice sheet models\nsuitable for accelerating glacier calving where bedrock geometry\nallows rapid inland migration of the grounding line\u2014e.g., in\nthe Pine Island Glacier region (27) have not yet been coupled\nto geoengineered climate simulations. The range of centennial-\nsmoothed natural variability in volcanic eruptive activity over the\nlast 100,000 years (28) and solar radiation over the last 9,300\nyears (29) have far smaller radiative impacts than those envisaged\nby the geoengineering solutions we discuss here. Hence natural\nsea-level variations will be far smaller (13) than those caused by\nboth anthropogenic emissions and effective geoengineering.\nEconomic Considerations. SO2 aerosol injection has received the\ngreatest economic and ethical treatment (4, 7). Early models\n(4) assumed damage caused by aerosols was negligible, a dubious\nassumption given more recent climate modelling (5, 7, 16, 19).\nGoes, et al. (see \u201cThe economics (or lack thereof) of aerosol geoen-\ngineering,\u201d available at http:\/\/www.geosc.psu.edu\/%7Ekkeller\/\nGoes_et_al_geoengineering_cc_2010_sub.pdf) consider an inte-\ngrated assessment model combining an energy balance climate\nmodel with an economic model. The model explores uncertainty\nin the parameter space of climate sensitivity, damage cost of\nradiative forcing by greenhouse gases, aerosols, and abatement\ncosts. Mixed abatement and geoengineering schemes explored\nthe economic damage of intermittent geoengineering (e.g., due to\nwars, failure of international agreement, or discovery of large\nnegative effects of geoengineering) over 6,300 simulated states\nof the world.\nSea-level rise damage can be grouped into loss of land, forced\nmigration of people, and increased flood risk. Land loss estimates\nare about 3% of 1995 GWP for a 1 m rise in sea level to 2100 (2),\nmigration estimated at about 1\u221520th of that amount (30), while\n100-year flood damage for the 136 largest value coastal cities (3)\ncan be estimated by Monte Carlo simulations at about 0.1% of\nGWP by 2070, with a 5% chance of it being as high as 0.5% GWP\n(see Fig. S2). Flooding may be the major economic impact of\nfailing to counter sea-level rise either by greenhouse gas mitiga-\ntion or geoengineering.\nSubstituting aerosol geoengineering for CO2 abatement can be\nan economically effective strategy (4). The cost-benefit analysis of\nGoes et al. reveals a surprisingly simple relation, given the uncer-\ntainties, for the damage costs (\u03b8, in % GWP) of the geoengineer-\ning aerosols needed to balance radiative forcing of doubled CO2,\nas a function of the probability of intermittent geoengineering\n(p); for benefit to occur \u03b8 < 0.62 \u2212 5.6p. As an indication of how\nthis relationship comes about consider that a failure to sustain\naerosol forcing can lead to sizeable and abrupt climatic changes\n(6, 7). Temperature rises rates may reach 1.5 K\u2215decade if aerosol\ninjections are stopped in 2070\u2014roughly five times the expected\nrate of increase due to greenhouse gases alone. The monetary\ndamage due to discontinuous aerosol geoengineering dominates\nthe cost-benefit analysis if the probability of discontinuity is larger\nthan about 11%. The relative contribution of aerosol geoengi-\nneering and CO2 abatement strategy hinges critically on uncer-\ntain estimates of the damage due to aerosol forcing. Even if we\nassume that aerosol forcing could be deployed continuously, the\naerosol geoengineering does not considerably displace CO2\nabatement in this economic optimal growth model unless the da-\nmage due to the aerosol forcing to counteract a doubling of CO2\nis less than 0.62% of GWP. However, if the aggressive aerosol\ngeoengineering were used until 2070 and then stopped, sea level\nwould respond with its characteristic time scale to the step-like\nchange in temperature such that in the following 25 years, it\nwould rise by 20\u201350 cm (see Fig. S3). Hence even though the\nresponse time is relatively slow, the rates of sea-level rise would\nbe dramatic, and should be explored with more sophisticated\nintegrated assessment models. Substituting geoengineering for\ngreenhouse gas emission abatement or removal constitutes a\nconscious risk transfer to future generations.\nMethods\nFuture sea-level rise is made up of several components that can vary on yearly\nto centennial time scales including thermal expansion of ocean water, melt-\ning of land ice, and changes in terrestrial storage. However each term in the\nsea-level budget is difficult to measure and subject to large errors (9, 11),\nhence we prefer the alternative method of fitting the total observed sea-\nlevel rise from 300 years of tide gauge data to reconstructed forcing factors.\nJevrejeva et al. (13, 15) used three paleoreconstructions (20\u201322) for TSI, vol-\ncanic eruptions, and greenhouse gas emissions and aerosols with a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo scheme fitted to observed sea level over the past 300 years\nto determine sets of model parameters. The models are then used with\nfuture climate forcing scenarios to find the range of sea-level response.\nThe Monte Carlo approach allows not only the best set of linear response\nmodel parameters to be found, but also provides confidence intervals taking\ninto account the complex spatial and temporal autocorrelation present in the\ntide gauge reconstructions (11). Results for the three different forcing recon-\nstructions are very similar, and typically the models of sea level based on any\nof them account for about 96% of the variance in mean annual global sea\nlevel from 1880 to 2001 (n \u00bc 121). Volcanic forcing varies between the three\nreconstructions by 20% over the period but the impact of this uncertainty is\nlimited given that volcanism accounts for about 25% to the total sea-level\nresponse (15) over the 20th century. The level of residual variability is thus\nprobably within the noise level in the observations. Here we combine the\nsets of model parameters from the three reconstructions into a single set\nof parameters that reflect the spread of values across all three models (Fig. 1).\nThe models estimate global sea-level rises of 0.54\u20131.01 mwith three radiative\nforcing scenarios (RCP3PD, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) by 2100.\nWe can test how well the model works by comparing the modeled\nresponse with observations of sea level following large volcanic eruptions\n(Fig. 1, inset). Grinsted et al. (30) studied the volcanic effects in detail and\nfind a significant rise and fall following an eruption due to a change in\nthe global water cycle, which is neither included nor significant at the annual\nresolution of our model. The modeled sea level change due to oceanic heat\ncontent (31) compares well with models for both the Tambora, 1815 and\nPinatubo 1991 eruptions (see Fig. S1).\nOur linear model cannot take into account new varieties of ice sheet\nbehavior that have not already played a role over the last 300 years, it does\nhowever capture the acceleration in recent decades (11). Estimates of\n15702 \u2223 www.pnas.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1008153107 Moore et al.\nsea-level rise allowing for up to order of magnitude increases in surface melt\nand glacier calving from Greenland and Antarctica range from 0.8\u20132 m (32)\nby 2100. The period 14000\u20137000 B.P. had an average rise rate of 11 mmyr\u22121\n(33). These rates are similar to those we predict by the 2070\u2019s. An even higher\nrate of sea-level rise was associated with melt-water pulse 1A (33), but in con-\ntrast to the deglaciation, the decay of modern ice sheets may be constrained\nby transport of large icebergs across the continental shelves of Antarctica and\nGreenland. Many large Antarctic icebergs remain stranded on shallows after\ncalving in very cold water for many years before entering the warmer waters.\nDuring the last interglacial sea level was around 7 m higher than present\nlevels, while rates of rise were less than 1 m per century, though potentially\nreaching higher rates for shorter periods (34). All these observations are\nconsistent with our estimated rates for the 21st century.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.We thank the anonymous referees and Klaus Keller for\nconstructive criticism that much improved the manuscript.
