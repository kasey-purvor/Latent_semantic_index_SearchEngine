In fact it emerges as a \nhighly complex process with sensitive political underpinnings in the emerging \nmultiply diverse societies. Research confirms the effect of factors such as race, \ncolour, ethnicity, gender and others in shaping career paths towards leadership \npositions; however, the level of significance for each factor is embedded in context \nand case.  \n \nEarlier feminist literature highlighted the traditional association of leadership with \nWhite male as a feudal patriarchal construction of male power over females, which \nreproduced gender discrimination in the public domain, particularly at senior \nleadership level. More recent research unveils another strong equation which is \nbetween race\/ethnicity and career progression, drawing attention to the under-\nrepresentation of people from BME backgrounds in educational leadership roles \n(Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006; Mackay and Etienne, 2006a, Lumby and Coleman, \n2007; Turner, 2006). The interplay of race\/ethnicity with career progression is also \nhighlighted by the National Statistics as a barrier to career destinations reflected in \nnominal presence of BME in senior positions. However, there is a visible gap in \nresearch on the issue of how visible religious affiliations (Home Office, 2001) affect \ncareer progressions of people from BME backgrounds. \n \nMuch research (London Leadership Centre, 2002; McKenley, Mayhead and Gordon, \n2002; Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006; Coleman, 2002; Mackay and Etienne, 2006a; \nOsler, 2003) has been carried out into why BME teachers are not  becoming leaders in \nthe respective educational institutions, and into the factors that hinder their career \nprogression and development; however, no research has been carried out specifically \non Muslim teachers. There are 1.6 million Muslims in Britain, comprising \u20183 per cent \nof the total population and over half (52 per cent) of the non-Christian religious \npopulation\u2019 (National Statistices, 2001). They are the largest faith group in the \ncountry after the Christians, and unlike some other faith groups Muslims tend to \nhighlight their religious identity (Brah 1996; Jacobson 1998; Modood 1990; Modood \net al 1997; Nielsen 1987). Furthermore, the age profile by faith draws attention to \nanother significant detail that 66% of the Muslims are under 35 years while for \nexample, only 39% of Christians fall within this category. Thus, the Muslims have the \nhighest youth profile in UK (National Statistices, 2001), which further emphasises the \nneed for appropriate policies and practices to fully avail the potential of this large \nworkforce on the one hand, and on the other hand it justifies the need to investigate \nthe barriers to their career progression, using faith as a category for analysis.    \n \nThe statistics highlight that in spite of a high youth population, the Muslims are \nlowest in education and employment (Abbas, 2004). This is a cause for concern, not \nonly for social justice and inclusion but also for engaged citizenship and societal \ncohesion. There is little research available on the experiences of Muslim teachers in \nthe British State Schools system and their professional journeys. The interface \nbetween the West and the Muslims is underpinned by the histories of conflict and \n 2 \ncontending claims. Multiple social, economic, strategic, historical and political factors \nhave added to the complexities of this interface in the British context, made more \nsensitive in the post 9\/11 and 7\/7 scenario. Experiences of discrimination and \nmarginalisation by the Muslims can further add to the complications, shaping \nperspectives and identities as \u2018we are positioned by, and position ourselves within the \nnarratives of the past\u2019 (Hall, 1993, p. 394). Therefore, in the light of challenging times \nfor Muslims around the world and more specifically how they are perceived in the \nWest, this paper contributes to a very important debate. \n \nThe paper explores the career paths of Muslim male teachers (MMTs) in English \nsecondary schools to investigate potential barriers to their career progression to senior \nleadership positions. The underpinning argument is that an awareness of the barriers \ncan be the way forward towards developing policies, procedures and strategies to \nremove or at least control the barriers. On another level, the paper also contributes to \nthe complex and sensitive debates on diversity, equal opportunities, social justice and \ninclusion by exploring the perceived marginalisation of this particular group of \nworkforce and its impact on their career destinations. The paper also contributes to the \nexisting debates by drawing attention to a new sub-field in the BME literature, to \ndevelop insights into the additional complexities that religious affiliation brings and \nthus as a consequence open up avenues for these complexities to be addressed. \nFinally, in a context of media hype of associating terrorism with young male \nMuslims, it becomes highly pertinent to explore male Muslim role models as they are \nvisible for young Muslims in education. \n \nMethodology \nThe paper draws upon a small study carried out to explore the career development and \nprogression of a sample of Muslim male teachers (MMT) working in the state sector \nin London schools in order to establish their perceptions of what aids or hinders their \nprogress to leadership positions within state school system. The study investigated the \ncareer aspirations of MMT and what happened to them whilst attempting to envisage \nthese aspirations. The intention was to debate the barriers, how the barriers were \novercome by the successful MMT, and to identify the facilitators or the strategies that \nproved effective in this regard to inform future policy deliberations. The research was \nset within the wider conceptual context of equality, social justice and inclusion and \nhow these relate to the issues of diversity in the workforce in mainstream state \nschools.  \nDue to the practical constraints and pragmatics involved, the focus of the study was \nlimited to one region. London was selected as a relevant case for the study \nparticularly because of its demographics. According to a DfES Survey (2002) cited in \na report by the Mayor of London (2004), BME pupils made up 43.5% of the number \nof pupils in London schools in 32 boroughs. This percentage is far higher in Inner \nLondon schools where the population density of BME people is far greater \n(Campbell-Stephens, 2006). However, the number of BME teachers in London \nschools is highly unrepresentative of the student population, making up only 7.4% of \nthe total number of teachers (London Development Agency, 2004). Furthermore, the \npercentage of BME staff in leadership positions at any level is even smaller than the \npercentage of teachers (Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006; Mackay and Etienne, 2006a). \nThis not only signals a lack of equal opportunities for BME, but also invites attention \nto other serious issues such as that BME students, as a consequence, are lacking the \n 3 \nrole models that they can relate and aspire to (Osler, 1997). More importantly, this \nsignals unavailability of the expertise of BME teachers and leaders who can better \nunderstand, empathize with and cater more closely to their needs (Campbell-Stephens, \n2006; Gilborn, 2001, 2005; Shah, 2006). \nThe data for this study was generated using a semi-structured questionnaire and then \n\u2018follow up\u2019 interviews. The questionnaire addressed the main areas of:  \n the career aspirations of these teachers, the career paths they chose and how \nthey planned their career progression;  \n the facilitators and obstacles to their career progression, including any types of \ndiscrimination, encouragement or help they may have received. \nThe study was originally intended to be conducted throughout all the 32 London \nboroughs to attempt as fuller a picture as possible of MMT working in London state \nschools and all members of the Muslim Teachers Association (MTA) were contacted. \nHowever, as with other similar research (Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006) finding \nwilling participants in all the boroughs proved to be difficult and given the gap in \ninformation required for the sample population on national databases (Ofsted, NCSL \nand DfES), \u2018snowball\u2019 sampling strategy was attempted (Cohen and Manion, 1994, p. \n88). The initial contacts\/participants were used as informants to identify further \nparticipants who could fulfil the requirements of being Muslim males with at least \nfive years teaching experience and \/or currently in middle management or senior \nmanagement positions. However, most participants did not know any such colleagues \n(or did not acknowledge they knew any), highlighting the probable lack of networking \namongst the intended research sample, and also signalling complex discourses at play \nthat constructed these responses. It was during interviewing that it emerged that the \npotential sensitivity of the study caused some teachers to refrain from participating \ndue to fear of unwanted ramifications at work. For example, one of the research \nparticipants telephoned the researcher to apologize for not being available for the \nfollow up interview. This was despite the fact that he had previously spoken to the \nresearcher about being discriminated against at his school, stating that if he was not a \nMuslim or an Asian Muslim, he would not have to go through some of the obstacles \nhe was facing at school from the senior management. \nGiven the context of inhibitions and\/or barriers to participation, only ten \nquestionnaires were returned, and six of the respondents expressed willingness to be \ninterviewed, providing their contact details. These participants came from five \ndifferent boroughs in the East End of London (Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney, \nand Redbridge and Haringey) - with significant numbers of Muslim students in their \nschools. Six semi-structured interviews (Robson, 2002, p. 270) were conducted. Four \ninterviews were one-to-one, while two teachers who worked in the same school were \ninterviewed together. Each interview lasted between 40 minutes and 1 hour 15 \nminutes. The appearance of these Muslim male interviewees were also noted down, \ne.g. whether they had a beard or not etc., in order to evaluate whether certain themes \nwere repeated by similar looking people. Some previous research (Modood, 1997; \nBush, Glover and Sood, 2006; Lumby and Coleman, 2007) has discussed the potential \neffects of visibility on the careers of BME teachers, and the intention was to see \nwhether similar experiences were reported by the research participants in this case. \n 4 \nThe interviews explored the professional experiences of the interviewees, their \naspirations when becoming teachers and how these aspirations had materialized \nthroughout their careers. The interviews also provided an opportunity to investigate \nfurther which facilitators and barriers impacted on the interviewees\u2019 professional \ndevelopment and career progression, and how some participants overcame any such \nobstacles to become senior leaders. \nBME Teacher and Career Trajectories \nDifficulties in recruiting and retaining teachers have been increasing (Ofsted, 2002, p. \n4) and the numbers of teachers entering the profession, especially from the BME \ncommunities remain low (Basit et al, 2006; 2007; Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006). \nDespite a recognition of the potential contributions of BME educational leaders and \nteachers in a multi-ethnic society like Britain (Siraj-Blatchford, 1993; Tomlinson, \n1990; Gordon, 2000), their representation is low as educational leaders (Lumby and \nColeman, 2007). Various policy measures have been adopted by the government to \naddress the issue although their effectiveness may be questioned. For example, there \nhas been great scepticism with regard to the extent to which the Race Relations Act \n(2000 and 2003) has impacted on the ground level, especially in state schools (Turner \n2006).  The DfES (2003) also recognised the lack of implementation of the Race \nRelations Act (2002), recommending that it should be ensured that \u2018all staff and \ngovernors are aware of legislative changes, particularly regarding equality of \nopportunities\u2019 (Powney et al., 2003, p. 16). Although the Act, like most policy \nmeasures, was a positive start in tackling some of the important and deeply grounded \nissues regarding race and ethnicity, it seemed to lack essential details on matters \nconnected to religious, and more specifically anti-Muslim discrimination or \nxenophobia which has become widespread in the U.K (Conway, 1997; Sajid, 2005).  \nGovernment agencies are sponsoring leadership courses such as \u2018Investing in \nDiversity\u2019 offered by the London Challenge, which aim to promote the idea of \nleadership to BME teachers and better equip them to access opportunities to senior \nleadership positions. These courses aim to tackle some of the challenges that BME \nteachers have reported, but again do not cater specifically for the needs of Muslim \nteachers and middle managers. NCSL also pledges to bring on \u2018more school leaders \nfrom a wider range of Backgrounds\u2019, and plans to \u2018support the development of more \nwomen and black and minority ethnic leaders\u2019 (Corporate Plan, 2008\/09), but these \nare also not specifically focused on Muslims who are the largest faith group after \nChristianity in the UK. This is a serious neglect on the part of policy makers, \nparticularly in the post 9\/11 scenario, as it ignores to take into account the impact of \npolitical, social, and global developments on lives and careers of a Muslim teachers, \nparticularly males. Individuals\u2019 wider life experiences impact on their professional \nchoices and career trajectories. There is a developing recognition in research of the \nimpact of teachers\u2019 own biographies on their education, training and development \n(Osler, 1997, p. 1).  \nIn the case of Muslims, the professional journey is riddled with complex challenges at \nall these phases. Increasingly, literature is unveiling social and educational \nexperiences of Muslim learners from childhood to adulthood (Abbas, ??; Ahmed, \nBasit, 1997; Haque, 2001) detailing negative experiences of the formation phase \n(Gronn, 1999), which could discourage aspirations. Those who do decide to join the \n 5 \nteaching profession, experience further barriers at training level (Basit et al, 2006; \n2007) and in teaching positions (Osler, 2003; Bush et al, 2006).  In spite of the fact \nthat the studies are broadly focused on BME teachers and their experiences, and not \non Muslim teachers as such, barriers and challenges specific and unique to Muslims \nemerge from BME data when participants happen to be Muslim, reflecting a complex \nmix of Islamophobia and racism.   \nThe perception among the Muslims, particularly among the youth, of being \u2018targeted\u2019 \n(Ahmed, 2003; Esposito, 2002; Hagopian, 2004) and the processes such as special \nlegislations, police raids, profiling, stop and search practices targeting Muslims and \nthe role of media have all contributed to marginalisation of Muslim in many fields \nincluding education and more so in leadership positions.  The occurrence of \nIslamophobic incidents, discrimination and violence, that increased sharply (Conway, \n1997) after the 1989 burning of the Satanic Verses, have become manifold since 9\/11 \nand 7\/7 (Muir and Smith, 2004; Sheridan, 2004; Van Driel, 2004; Sajid, 2005). \nUnfortunately, Islamophobic ideas, although deeply ingrained in racist sentiment and \nreligious intolerance have become acceptable to many (Muir and Smith, 2004) as \nIslam is now conceived to be the new threat to civil society and democracy. As a \nsubsequent, institutionalized Islamophobia has become widely practiced (Muir and \nSmith, 2004), even in schools where Muslims make up the majority of the school \npopulation. Many independent reports have highlighted intentional or at least un-\nintentional  institutional discrimination against Muslims (Li and Associates, 2006), \ndrawing attention to \u2018discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, \nthoughtlessness and stereotyping, which disadvantage individuals\/groups\u2019 (p. 10). \nThis paper confirms from the data that the MMT suffer different kinds of \ndiscrimination and obstacles in their career progression, particularly towards \nleadership positions. However, much of the discrimination reported is covert in \nnature.  The major factors underpinning this discrimination are identified through the \ndata as being: Islamophobia; perceptions of visibility, and a lack of understanding of \nthe issues relating to diversity. \nIslamophobia \nIslamophobia refers to \u2018an irrational distrust, fear or rejection of the Muslim religion \nand those who are (perceived as) Muslims\u2019 (Barry van Driel, p. 3). It is endorsed by \nan \u2018unfounded hostility towards Islam, and therefore, fear or dislike of all or most \nMuslims\u2019 (Conway, 1997, p. 1). It is manifest in vilification and demonization of \nMuslims, endorsing negative attitudes, violence, harassment, discrimination, and \nstereotyping. It suggests  a form of cultural racism (Modood, 1997) not necessarily \noriginating from contempt towards other colours but out of a dislike or hatred for \nMuslim culture. Islam is increasingly being portrayed as a threat to social cohesion \nand integration in the British Society and the \u2018Western Way of Life\u2019 (Allen, 2004). \nThe discourses of social cohesion and \u2018the British way of life\u2019 further emphasise an \ninherent difference and incompatibility between Islam and British Multiculturalism \n(Abbas, 2004; Allen, 2004), alienating and marginalising the Muslims.  \nThe effect that Islamophobia exercises on the underachievement of Muslim pupils in \nUK schools has been widely recognized (Richardson, 2004b; Richardson, 2004a; \nAMS, 2004),  Islamophobic incidents show the depth to which Islamophobic \ndiscrimination or ignorance are prevalent amongst teaching staff, educational leaders \n 6 \nand school governors (Sheridan, 2004). However, it seems that no real attention has \nbeen given especially in Leadership and Teacher Training programmes to educate the \nparticipants (Haque, 2004). \nMuslim male teachers participating in this study generally felt very alienated in the \ncurrent climate of mistrust of Muslims due to the threat of so called Islamic terrorism \nand its portrayal in the media. Some of the teachers were afraid to make networks \nwith other Muslim teachers due to a fear they would be labelled \u2018extremists\u2019. An \natmosphere of feeling constantly watched and scrutinized came up regularly in their \nresponses. They even seemed reluctant to participate in the study: not knowing who \nthe researcher was, or his intentions, many respondents might have felt it would be \nbetter not to participate, and thus avoid any adverse reaction to it from any of the \nsecurity services, as obvious from this quote: \nI do feel that Muslims here are feeling alienated, with regards their status  in \nthe community. Therefore they are very reluctant to go to or get involved in \nvarious activities (where networking takes place) because of the media. In that \nsense I did feel when you approached me (to participate in the research) \u2018what \nis this all about? What is it going to be used for? But Alhamdulillaah (all \npraises are for God) after talking to you I felt reassured.  \nSome teachers did not want to bring any unnecessary attention to themselves, and felt \nafraid to talk to other visible Muslims in public because of the fear of being found \nguilty by association, in the event that the person was being monitored by security \nservices and they could become targets by proxy: \nIt\u2019s a difficult one. I\u2019m a Muslim but because of the media and the way things \nare being portrayed it is very difficult. For example sometimes when I\u2019m \ntalking to an Arab brother or someone, I think \u2018Oh my God\u2019 are they being \nwatched. (Research Participant) \nThe participating teachers felt that discriminatory attitude towards Muslims in the \nwider community was a major contributing factor for the lack of Muslims in senior \nmanagement positions. Several teachers commented that they felt that many people \ninvolved in the recruitment processes did not see Muslims as leaders in mainstream \nschools and as such discouraged them from applying for promotion. One participant \nwho had been a head of year and was currently a head of department, was told that he \nwas too ambitious and was wanting things too soon when he told his head teacher he \nwished to apply for the FL programme to become an associate assistant head teacher.    \nSharif\ni\n commented that he was one of many Asian Muslim males at his school to be \ndiscouraged from applying for promotion and told they were not yet ready. He further \nargued that white members of staff, who he believed had either the same or less \nexperience than him were being encouraged to be ambitious and take further \nresponsibility in the school: \nthere are people being encouraged and some that are not, that happen to be \nMuslim. I think there are some people \u2013 not all of them, that don\u2019t see \nMuslims in senior positions. They are told they are not ready for these \npositions. The feeling is that there is some kind of discrimination going on. \n 7 \nBecause in terms of competency and ability we don\u2019t see what they are talking \nabout! \nMuhammad who had secured an assistant headship recently in another borough with \nless Muslim students, had applied on several occasions for an internal promotion but \nwas unsuccessful.  He was convinced that his school and borough were intentionally \nnot employing Muslim males in senior management positions: \nPeople are very subtle. However, when you see it affecting a lot of Muslims it \nmakes you wonder. How can it happen to all of us who are capable? Are we \nall of less ability? For example, it also happened to a colleague who applied \nfor promotion but was not given it \u2013 although he had served the school well \nand got tremendous results in his department. Why was he declined? I don\u2019t \nknow! You can see other white members of staff who got the promotion (who) \ndon\u2019t have the same track record or the same presence and haven\u2019t achieved as \nmuch in the school. \nA shared perception was that being a Muslim candidate it was more difficult to get a \njob unless you were a great deal better then other candidates. Karim, describing his \nexperiences at interviews, felt that he had always had to be not only better than other \ncandidates in order to get the job, but disproportionably better. Other teachers echoed \nthe same sentiment: \nThey need to see no one is better. If you are equal you have no chance. (Bilal) \nIslamophobic ideas and attitudes of some head teachers appear to have played a \nnegative role in the career progression of Muslim teachers, which confirms generic \nfindings of other research (Conway, 1997; Allen, 2004; Sheridan, 2004; Sajid, 2005). \nThese ideas and attitudes are largely attributed to media presentation of specific \nhappenings as generalisations, creating misconceptions, misunderstanding and \nmisreadings with negative impact on affected groups and communities. These seem to \nhave stronger impact on career progression of Muslim male teachers. The huge \nliterature on Islamophobia itself is a strong indicator of the discrimination Muslim \nteachers must be subjected to. Many studies have highlighted marginalisation of BME \nteachers (Bush, Glover and Sood, 2006; Lumby and Coleman, 2007; Shah, 2006), and \nwomen teachers (Coleman, 2002), including even Muslim women teachers (Osler, \n2003), but there is no study with explicit focus on marginalisation of Muslim male \nteachers in the present day context of Islamophobia and an un-informed loudly \npropagated association between Islam and terrorist activities (Esposito, 2002). Gender \nin interplay with faith in this case has become a factor for marginalisation. \nNorm of Visibility: what a leader should look like \nThere was a strong perception amongst MMT that they are not seen as potential \nschool leaders in mainstream schools due to being different from what is considered \nto be the norm by those in positions of power. Just as women may be seen as \u2018in the \nwrong place\u2019 (Gold, 2006), some school leaders may feel that Muslim teachers are not \n\u2018naturally\u2019 (Lumby, 2006) able to fulfil senior roles in schools. This however, is not a \nnew finding, DiTomaso and Hooiberj (1996) discuss that leaders \u2018often exclude \ncandidates from BME and other diverse backgrounds due to a \u2018perceived \n 8 \nincompetence\u2019 (p. 180). This study endorses \u2018leader prototypes\u2019 (Foti and Miner, \n2003), where people unconsciously have an inbuilt stereotype of what a leader should \nlook like and thus although believing they are acting in relation to equity when \nappointing new leaders, tend to discriminate on the grounds of those inbuilt beliefs. \nDiscrimination is more likely, the more visibly different the teacher is to what is \nconsidered to be the norm (Milliken and Martins, 1996; Modood, 1997). Thus those \nwho did things differently would be seen as \u2018outsiders\u2019 or part of an out-group.  \nLumby and Coleman (2007) also show how this type of discrimination can be \nmanifested both consciously and intentionally, whilst not being considered \ndiscriminatory. They describe how an impetus to appoint a leader in one\u2019s own \nlikeness was made explicit in another case organization by a senior leader of that \norganization: \nWhen you appoint, there is a tendency to appoint one of your own, to identify \nwith someone, with their background or their demeanour\u2026If you stood back \nand said what is it we need?...I need someone who is different to me, that \nwould bring a completely different viewpoint to the college, it\u2019s much more \nchallenging. It is more challenging to the team and more challenging to you \nindividually to deal with someone who doesn\u2019t see things the way you do. \n(Senior Leader, individual interview in Lumby and Coleman, 2007, p. 40) \n \nIn spite of increasing numbers of BME students in higher education (National \nStatistics), \u2018there is clear evidence that the higher echelon and higher status jobs are \nheld disproportionately by white males\u2019 (Lumby and Coleman, 2007, p. 60).  \nThe interview responses indicate a perceived bias among senior leaders towards \nemploying people similar to themselves: \nIf you know the right people and your face fits then you got the job no matter \nwho else applies. They just employed a white lady\u2026 She only had about two \nyears of teaching experience at her old school\u2026she was seeing one of the \nsenior management team. Another black teacher, not a Muslim, has done the \nsame job as acting head of department three times but never got the job. He \nleft and became a head of department in another school \u2013 he is now a deputy \nhead! \nIn an investigation into BME leaders\u2019 access to career progression through the NPQH \n(London Leadership Centre, 2002) 70% of the BME school leaders participating in it \nreported that issues of ethnicity and racism have had a negative impact on their career; \nthe majority of these were men. These feelings were endorsed by the research \nparticipants who strongly believed that: \nThe SMT should represent the community we have here. From what we have \nseen, people may not be employed due to other (hidden) agendas. For this \nreason senior management would prefer to work with people similar to \nthemselves, thus there is a reluctance to work with people more overtly \nreligious. The head teacher has often commented this school is a secular \nschool \u2013 not a Muslim school!  \n 9 \nNine out of the ten responding teachers complained that they had been discriminated \nagainst at some time in their careers and especially when applying for jobs and \npromotion, and associated it with being visibly Muslims. However, the types of \ndiscrimination experienced were often very subtle and difficult to prove. The tenth \nrespondent said that if his appearance had been more recognizably Islamic, he also \nmay have experienced discrimination, which he had heard other more visible Muslim \nteachers complaining about: \nMaybe if I was sitting here looking a different way, then I would be saying \nsomething different about discrimination.  I think it  is because of the way I \nlook and the way I sound I do not experience those things \nBeing visibly Muslim emerged as a barrier particularly for promotion purposes. The \nparticipants attributed this to the current unease created by the media hype regarding \nthe perceived threat of Islamic terrorism. The more visible they were as Muslims, the \nmore seriously they felt that discrimination was affecting their career prospects, \nalthough, the interviewers were often very subtle in the way they hid their hesitation. \nThe media were often blamed for the way they were received at interviews, and in one \ncase the respondent felt this impacted on the interview outcomes: \nPeople don\u2019t say what they feel about you, but I often get the feeling they are \nvery reserved with me. I think it is the media link as it\u2019s the main educator of \nthe masses. They (due to what is represented in the media) have a picture of \nwho I am and thus are scared to employ me maybe, they are very good at \nhiding it however, but not enough \u2013 you can always tell. I think since 9\/11 it \nhas been very different. \nAnother participant stated that he knew before he had even answered any questions at \nan interview he had once attended for the post of the head of department, that he was \nnot going to be offered the job because of his visible Islamic appearance: \nWhen I walked in, I could see the hatred in their faces towards me. They were \nboth white women and I could tell they were both disgusted with the way I \nlooked.   \nInterestingly, he did eventually get a head of department position in a neighbouring \nborough and explained that his new head teacher had commented at the interview that \nhe had worked with other Muslim teachers at his previous school.  This raises another \nimportant issue; that of preparing senior leaders and appointing panels to manage \ndiversity positively. Secondly, this quotation illustrates the perceived difficulty of \nbecoming a senior manager in certain predominately Muslim populated boroughs:  \nI have found that although there may be many Muslim middle managers in \ncertain areas (he mentioned the name of a borough) for example, they have no \nMuslim senior managers but lots of Muslim teachers and children. The same \ngoes for (he mentioned three other connecting boroughs). It does seem rather \nstrange. (Rehan) \nAlthough MMT teachers might prefer working in areas with a Muslim majority which \nmight mean that they were less likely to be considered \u2018outsiders\u2019 there seemed to be \n 10 \nstronger resistance to their appointment to leadership positions in these areas.  One \nparticipant explained how he had applied for several deputy positions in various \nheavily Muslim and BME populated boroughs but had not even been short listed, \ndespite having the NPQH. Due to Islam being more visible in these areas, the \nstructural resistance to visible Muslim male teachers emerged as greater.  \nAnother issue highlighted by the participants was that, like other BME teachers, they \nwere generally seen as tools to handle BME students only, and not recognised as \nmainstream staff capable of senior leadership. They emphasised that they were rather \nexpected to take unofficial lead roles in tackling problems relating to \u2018Muslim\u2019 issues \nand meeting Muslim parents or to take the lead in dealing with issues pertaining to \nMuslim children. These teachers definitely saw themselves as role models for Muslim \nstudents and were anxious to support them in a \u2018hostile\u2019 environment\u2019 but they also \nwanted to be recognised as mainstream staff capable of being mainstream leaders. \nThey critiqued the stereotypical mentalities of many school leaders, who failed to see \nthem with the potential of \u2018being a school leader in the true sense\u2019 (Osler, 1997).  \nAs with other research on BME teachers (McKenley, Mayhead and Gordon, 2002; \nBush, Glover and Sood, 2006), the majority of MMT in this study emphasised that \nthey found it harder to find suitable employment, according to their experience and \nqualifications. Technologies used to discourage or discriminate against these teachers \nwere often covert, and as such were difficult to identify conclusively. There was also \na perception amongst some of the MMT teachers in this study, that there existed a \nglass ceiling, with regards to career progression that was difficult to break and that, \ncounter-intuitively, this might be particularly strong in areas with a high Muslim \npopulation.  \nWorking through Diversity?  \nThe role of the head teacher and senior management teams as the main agents in \nestablishing harmonious relationships and equality of opportunity throughout the \nschool community appears to be critical. A lack of cultural and\/or religious \nunderstanding on the part of the head teacher\/leaders was often cited by respondents \nas a cause for teachers\u2019 unhappiness in a school. The participating teachers \ncommented that an effective head teacher was the one who understood the needs of all \nmembers of his\/her staff and responded to them in a fair and unbiased way: \nMy first head teacher, in a Catholic school with strong discipline was straight \ntalking and fair. He would cover my class for Friday prayers. He had \nleadership qualities. (He) Would not tolerate (discriminatory) attitudes. He \nbecame an executive head that was seconded to other schools \u2013 but he was \nmodest. (Rehan)  \nConversely, many of the teachers commented that they had bad experiences with head \nteachers due to the head teacher\u2019s approach and lack of sensitivity or understanding \ntowards issues of religion and race. One teacher had been asked by his line manager \nto design a new multi-racial curriculum for his specialist subject. He consequently \nprepared a new curriculum which was approved by his line manager and it was posted \non the school website to be used as resource by all teachers in the school. However, \nsome time later he was questioned by his head teacher as she felt that some of the \n 11 \ncontent, drawn from Islamic texts, was discriminatory towards women. The head \nteacher asked for part to be removed.  The teacher had used the Islamic material as \none of a number of examples from different cultures that were relevant to the topic \nbeing studied not as examples that he necessarily believed in himself.  Despite this, \nthe head teacher continued to have doubts regarding Muhammad\u2019s ability to be a \nsenior manager due to what she perceived to be his lack of awareness of equal \nopportunities. Later, he was given a bad reference by his head teacher, stating that he \nhad a poor understanding of equal opportunities, which had serious implications for \nhis career progression. The participating teacher attributed this attitude to lack of \nunderstanding on the part of the head teacher to recognise and work with diversity.  \nSomething that could have been avoided by open unbiased discussion: \nSome people can only work with certain other people. In that sense it can be \ndiscriminatory. For example, Pakistani with Pakistani and English with \nEnglish. They only have their own set way of working with other people. \nTheir comfort zone is with a certain type of person and therefore will have the \neffect of being discriminatory.  \nThe role of a head teacher in supporting the achievement\/s of individual staff \nmembers has been widely documented (London Leadership Centre, 2002; McKenley, \nMayhead and Gordon, 2002). Several participating teachers commented that they felt \nthat their career paths in their current schools had been affected by discriminatory \nattitudes of their head teachers towards employing Muslim or BME staff in senior \nmanagement teams:  \nHead teachers set the trend (in the school). Some would (employ a Muslim or \na BME teacher on the SMT) \u2013 even though they are not particularly \ncomfortable. Some will try \u2013 others won\u2019t. It all comes down to their honesty \nto you. Again I am thinking about my own head. Sometimes you have to \nquestion their integrity because of what they do, not just one thing but their \ngeneral attitude. They must have a problem, an issue. \nThe role of head teachers as the main agents in establishing harmonious working \nrelationships with staff and ensuring equality of opportunity throughout the school \ncommunity is also seen to be crucial (London Leadership Centre, 2002; McKenley, \nMayhead and Gordon, 2002), especially in issues relating to diversity (Lumby and \nColeman, 2007). Some participating teachers complained that their head teachers had \nvery little understanding of issues relating to Muslim culture and faith, and as a \nconsequence, albeit unwittingly, created \u2018in-groups\u2019 and \u2018out-groups\u2019 (DiTomaso and \nHooijberj, 1996; Lumby and Coleman, 2007)  in their schools. Muslim teachers saw \nthemselves as forced to be \u2018out-groups\u2019. One teacher recalled how he had observed a \nhead teacher insulting a Muslim girl who had been talking in assembly. The head \nteacher had asked the girl if she had not been listening because of her headscarf: \n\u2018Was it that thing around your head that was stopping you listening?\u2019 This \nshows you their mindset. Having said that, there are good head teachers \naround. I think it eventually boils down to leadership in the end. \nAs in previous research (Haque, 2004), the majority of the teachers in this study felt \nthat more needed to be done by the government and various agencies, including the \n 12 \nNCSL, to help Muslim teachers access senior leadership positions in mainstream state \nschools. Many teachers pointed out the need to change the perceptions and \nunderstandings of the incumbent and future head teachers\u2019 on issues of diversity, and \nas such the NCSL should make considerable efforts to incorporate issues of diversity \nand religious understanding in their courses, as well as to develop leadership courses \nfor Muslims specifically.   \nThere is a need for encouragement from the NCSL and other establishments \ninvolved in preparing leaders \u2013 that they recognise having Muslim leaders in \ninstitutions with large Muslim populations is significantly a good thing. They \nshould promote that.  (Sharif) \nHead teachers did not always appreciate the impact of associating alcohol with social \noccasions, which hindered the respondents from participating in various social-cum-\nprofessional activities (Pole, 1999). They not only missed out on opportunities but due \nto this many colleagues would assume they were unsociable, adding to the negative \nperception of \u2018them and us\u2019. All participants commented on this area: \nI do not attend the end of year meals or other whole staff celebrations. Myself \nand other Muslim staff haven\u2019t attended due to alcohol. (Muhammad) \nA lot of the time socials are organized in pubs. I am reluctant to go there. \n(Rehan) \nSchool functions are fine. I do not have a problem with places of alcohol, \nalthough a lot of brothers do. But I have not been able to go to functions in a \npub, as it\u2019s the environment. The pub has been specifically designed for the \nconsumption of alcohol. So I don\u2019t go to informal functions. (Faris) \nSome of the teachers felt that their hesitation or unwillingness to attend such \ngatherings served indirectly to intensify Muslim\/non-Muslim division amongst staff \nand impacted on their promotions\/progression. They felt that more should be done to  \nmake it easier for Muslim staff to participate in such activities: \nIf their intention is to socialize to improve the school atmosphere and teacher \nperformance, then they should accommodate (us). But if it is just social, I \nguess they can do whatever they want. (Muhammad) \nDue to barriers to after-school socialising with other staff and especially with the \nsenior leadership team, the Muslim teachers felt they had to work harder than other \nstaff in similar positions, and their chances of being promoted internally at the school \nwas seriously affected:  \nI was working harder because I couldn\u2019t socialize with them. (Rehan) \nI feel that I do have to prove myself in order to stand out positively, because I \nwill not have the chance to socialize with senior staff because of alcohol etc. \nThat will be my only chance, whereas other staff can do so (socialise) and \nbuild more positive relationships. (Sharif)  \n 13 \nBilal felt that his abstention from the pub was a major factor for his not being \nsuccessful in attempts to be promoted internally: \nI normally don\u2019t fully attend Christmas party and end of year farewells \nbecause of the Alcohol. I listen to the speeches but when the drinks are served \nI leave. The previous Head teacher would meet staff in the pub, but I didn\u2019t \nattend. If you are not behaving as they do, you are seen as a different person \nand are treated accordingly.  \nThis feeling of being social \u2018outsiders\u2019 (Lumby and Coleman, 2007; Osler, 2006) \nemerged as a serious barrier. Participating teachers felt, as other teachers in BME \nstudies (Lumby and Coleman, 2007; Osler, 2006; Rusch, 2004; Sajid, 2005), that \nbeing perceived as different from the norm has had a negative impact on their \npromotion opportunities in their respective schools.  However, it would seem that \nMuslim teachers have additional reasons for feeling they are \u2018outsiders\u2019, which are \nlinked directly to their religious beliefs, and a lack of understanding of them on the \npart of head teachers and other staff. \nWhere Do We Go From Here? \nThe context created by interacting discourses is complex, sensitive, and volatile, with \nindications of risk to future destination of young Muslims in particular, and to wider \nsocietal cohesion in general. A high level of sociological understanding and analysis \nis needed to foresee the potential dangers in the intentional or un-intentional \ndiscrimination and marginalisation the Muslims are being subjected to. This would \nhave more serious repercussions in the case of male Muslim teachers who could be \nstrong positive role models for young Muslims. This is high time to seriously engage \nwith the barriers to progression of Muslim male teacher to leadership positions with \nexplicit policies and well-defined strategies, instead of leaving it too late for \nresponsive strategies which might not prove effective as in many other cases. \n \nThe increasing marginalisation of male Muslim teachers is an intensifying \nphenomenon as confirmed by the research participants. As in other studies (Osler, \n1997; Campbell-Stephens, 2006), some of teachers in this study were significantly \noverqualified for the jobs they were doing, but had been unsuccessful in gaining \npromotion. There was also a general feeling that they were not progressing as quickly \nin their careers as their white counterparts, although no particular reasons could be \nattributed for this. The participants suggested actions for addressing the situation with \nparticular emphasis on professional development programmes for Muslim teachers, \nprovision of mentoring\/coaching, monitoring for equally opportunities in \nselection\/promotion of Muslim teachers, explicit policies, strategies for handling \nIslamophobia, training programmes for head teachers\/senior leaders for managing \ndiversity including faith, countering negative media campaigns, and developing \nsupportive networks, among others. \nThe participants highlighted the need for focused programmes and courses to cater \nspecifically for the needs of Muslim teachers, to better equip them to become senior \nmanagers, and to tackle the challenge of prevailing biases in schools. The NCSL has \nat present 37 different programmes and courses running under their umbrella, which \nare aimed at the promotion of leadership in education and only one of these (Equal \n 14 \nAccess to Promotion) is focused on BME intending \u2018to address the professional \ndevelopment needs of black and minority ethnic (BME) teachers in middle leadership \nand provide support for them to move on to senior leadership roles\u2019 (NCSL Online \nhttp:\/\/www.ncsl.org.uk\/programmes-index\/eap-index.htm). However, there is not a \nsingle programme focusing on the needs of Muslims or even with a secondary focus \non Muslim teachers. The argument often put forward is that such programmes cannot \nattend to each ethnic group\u2019s needs in view of the presence of a large number of \nethnic groups in the UK schools. This argument in fact is highly na\u00efve as it refuses to \nacknowledge the complexity of the MMT issue. It also ignores the emerging scenario \nand the international political targeting of Muslims which might widen the divide \nbetween Muslim\/non-Muslim, signalling risk for future societies. Providing support \nand opportunities for professional development to marginalised groups would not \nonly ensure equal opportunities but would also contribute to societal cohesion. \nMackay and Etienne (2006b) argue for specific programmes that target individuals in \norder to \u2018review the structural imbalances within organizations that handicap black \nleaders\u2019 experiences of work\u2019 (p. 26). This observation becomes more significant in \nthe case of Muslim teachers in the back drop of political developments and media \nfurore about Muslims and its implications for Muslim professionals in the UK and \nelsewhere. \nDespite the recognized benefits of networking (Coleman, 1999; Bush et al., 2005; \nCampbell-Stephens, 2006) only a small number of the teachers in this study were \ninvolved in any network. Not only that they distanced themselves from many \nmainstream social and networking activities for multiple reasons but many even \nintentionally avoided being part of even Muslim groups or networks due to a fear of \nbeing connected to Islamic extremism. In fact the participating teachers felt so \nthreatened by media vilification of Muslims that they were afraid to engage in net-\nworking as indicated earlier in relation to participation in the research project.  \nOnly two out of the ten teachers in this research used networks to aid their career \nprogression and professional development.  Upon probing during interviews, it \nemerged that although many of the teachers interviewed understood and appreciated \nthe benefits of networking they did not participate, either due to a lack of knowledge \nof existing networks in their community or area or they did not make any conscious \nefforts to find or get involved in networks because they knew very few teachers who \nwere \u2018like minded\u2019, or who they felt comfortable to share experiences with. \nFurthermore, they admitted that being Asian and Muslim, they often did not feel that \nthey could confide in white (non-Muslim) colleagues at work because they would not \nunderstand their problems or points of view, or that they would be accused of being \ntoo sensitive or negative about certain issues: \nThey (white non-Muslim teachers) don\u2019t really see things in the same way. I \ndon\u2019t feel comfortable addressing things with them. I\u2019ve tried on several \noccasions to explain things but they don\u2019t understand and feel we have chips \non our shoulders or we are too sensitive or worse still - too extreme. (Karim)  \nMany studies confirm that a good or inspirational role model aids career progression \n(Osler, 1997; London Leadership Centre, 2002; Bush et al., 2005; Hayes, 2005; Bush, \nGlover and Sood, 2006), and mentors can be influential as role models. The \nparticipants certainly felt that mentoring contributed to their career progression.  \n 15 \nReports for NCSL (McKenley, Mayhead and Gordon, 2002; Bush et al., 2005) \nrecommend mentoring for BME teachers aspiring to leadership, but it would seem \nthat this advice was not generally being adhered to by head teachers and schools of  \nthe teachers in this study in line with Turner\u2019s (2006) claims that government policy \nand initiatives regarding race and equal opportunities, despite being seemingly \naccepted by schools, are often not enacted at the ground level.  \n \nThe need to educate teachers and leaders in schools on issues of diversity was another \n\u2018to do\u2019 action greatly emphasised by the participants in order to help create \nharmonious relationships between all staff in these schools - school leaders to help \nfoster a climate of trust and safety amongst all members of the school community. \nLumby and Coleman argue that: \nThe training of black and minority ethnic leaders may help to ensure that the \nimbalance in the ranks of educational leaders is improved, but all leaders, \nparticularly those from the dominant white, male middle class ranks need to be \naware of and understand issues of diversity and ethnicity. (2007, p. 66) \nThe participants affirmed this by providing examples of the failure on the part of the \nhead teachers and other senior leaders to fully understand and manage diversity in \npractice, in spite of their being desirous of doing so in some cases. The reasons \nincluded a lack of awareness on the part of the head teacher of  the culture of the \nschool (Lewis, 1996) and the complexity of the issues of diversity (London \nLeadership Centre, 2002).  In the case of Muslims, the complexity of the issues of \ndiversity is further enhanced because of the inner diversity of this faith group (Shah, \n2008). There is no doubt that variations in the level of adherence to different Islamic \nteachings and \u2018values\u2019 among Muslims add to the challenge of managing these issues. \nThere is also the challenge of the range of diversity of MMT, from different country \nand cultural heritages, with conflicting interpretations of Islam. This can \nunderstandably be frustrating for policy making and implementation. However, the \nimportant issues such as career progression of MMTs can\u2019t be ignored as too \ncomplicated or un-resolvable \u2013 these need to be attended to for informed practice. The \nhead teachers and senior leaders need to be trained in tackling these complex and \nsensitive issues, already made worse by media exploitation of Muslims (Muir and \nSmith, 2004; Sheridan, 2004; Van Driel, 2004; Sajid, 2005). This is important for \npreparing a truly representative and effective leadership in education.  \nThe participating MMTs recognised the efforts being made by the government and the \nNCSL to promote diversity of teaching staff but believed that more needed to be done \nto rectify the current imbalance. Some went further and argued that the NCSL also \nneeded to be educated on issues pertaining to Muslim teachers, and to incorporate that \nknowledge to leadership and teacher training courses. Their responses clearly signpost \nthe need for enhanced knowledge and understanding to introduce positive changes in \nattitudes leading towards improved practice and better policies.   \nReferences \nAbbas, T. 2004.
