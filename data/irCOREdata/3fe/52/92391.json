This article views the bureaucratic form of organization as both an agent \nand an expression of key modern social innovations that are most clearly manifested \nin the non-inclusive terms by which individuals are involved in organizations. Modern \nhuman involvement in organizations epitomizes and institutionally embeds the crucial \nyet often overlooked cultural orientation of modernity whereby humans undertake ac-\ntion along well-specified and delimited paths thanks to their capacity to isolate and \nsuspend other personal or social considerations. The organizational involvement of \nhumans qua role agents rather than qua persons helps unleash formal organizing \nfrom being tied to the indolence of the human body and the languish process of per-\nsonal or psychological reorientation. Thanks to the loosening of these ties, the bu-\nreaucratic organization is rendered capable to address the shifting contingencies un-\nderlying modern life by reshuffling and re-assembling the roles and role patterns by \nwhich it is made. The historically unique adaptive capacity of bureaucracy remains \nthough hidden behind the ubiquitous presence of routines and standard operating \nprocedures \u2013requirements for the standardization of roles\u2013 that are mistakenly ex-\nchanged for the essence of the bureaucratic form.  \n \nThe reigning myth today is that the evils of society can all be understood as evils \nof impersonality, alienation, and coldness. The sum of these three is an ideology \nof intimacy\u2026[that] transmutes political categories into psychological categories. \nRichard Sennett, The Fall of Public Man \n \nThe End of the Bureaucratic Age \nPopular belief associates bureaucracy with routine, initiative stifling office work and \nan introvert organizational culture of rigid administrative procedures and redundant \ncomplexity. Although social reality seldom appears as simple as the popular image \nwants it to be, this oversimplified picture of the bureaucratic form of organization has \nnevertheless been widely shared and persistent. Critical humanism and artistic aver-\nsion1 of bureaucratic systems have allied with left-inspired criticism of the organiza-\n                                                          \n1 The novels of Franz Kafka, the Trial and the Tower stand here as major examples. Though \nperhaps visionary images of some terrifying aspects of modernity in general, the novels can \ncertainly be read as metaphoric descriptions of bureaucratic institutions. The artistic criticism \nagainst state administration is expressed well in the spirit of Dadaism and Surrealism but such \na suspicious attitude towards large administrative systems can be re-encountered across most \nartistic movements throughout the last century. It is important to keep that in mind to under-\nstand the neo-romantic elements of the current criticism of bureaucracy. \n 2\ntional practices of capitalism or statism to re-enhance the image of bureaucracy as an \ninstitution that degrades human dignity and perpetuates social inequalities (e.g. \nAdorno and Horkeimer, 1972\/1937; Castoriadis, 1985, 1987; Marcuse, 1955). For \nquite different, though not unrelated, reasons bureaucracy has been faced with distrust \nand distaste by liberal neo-classical and post neo-classical economics. While formal \norganization has occasionally been seen as a reasonable governance alternative to the \nmarket (Arrow, 1974; Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1975), the dominant picture in eco-\nnomics has tended to view bureaucracy as an institution that inhibits economic growth \nand threatens individual liberty (see, e.g. Hayek, 1960).  \nIn recent years, bureaucracy has repeatedly received a severe verdict that pre-\ndicts its unmistakable demise. Another basic form of organization often referred to as \nthe entrepreneurial or network-shaped organization (e.g. Heckscher and Donnellon, \n1994; Rifkin, 2000) is said to be pushing bureaucracy to the margins of the contempo-\nrary organizational and economic scene. However, apart from a few studies outside \nthe immediate realm of management and organization theory (e.g. Castells, 1996, \n2001; Carnoy, 2000; Fukuyama, 1997), the claim concerning the demise of bureauc-\nracy has not been supported by the systematic investigation of the organizational and \noccupational order of modernity. As a matter of fact there has never been a serious \nintention in the fad-driven mainstream management discipline (a major exponent of \nthe bureaucratic demise) of systematically comparing bureaucracy with alternative \nforms of organization.  \nTo the serious student of organization forms, the juxtaposition of the bureau-\ncratic and entrepreneurial forms of organization does not hold (du Gay, 1994, 2000). \nWe do hope to show in this article that the entrepreneurial and managerial critique of \nbureaucracy is based on oversimplified and stylized images of the bureaucratic form \nof organization. Most significantly, such a critique is marked by an astonishingly na-\n\u00efve functionalism devoid of any historical awareness. These limitations contribute to \nthe misinterpretation of bureaucracy through the overrepresentation of secondary \ncharacteristics of the organizational order underlying modernity. Management \u201cthe-\nory\u201d has often given proof of surprisingly poor historical awareness but the assertion \nof organizational change, profound enough to justify the end of bureaucratic age, \nmakes such an inadequacy woefully evident. Neither bureaucracy nor its asserted al-\nternatives can properly be understood unless modernity and the social and organiza-\ntional innovations it has brought about are sufficiently appreciated. \nDespite, however, the oversimplified character of the discourse concerning the \nend of the bureaucratic age, it is crucial not to lose sight of the multifaceted economic, \ntechnological and social changes to which such a discourse is but one symptom. Such \nchanges are associated with the diffusion of values, orientations or life styles that in-\n 3\ncreasingly reflect the culture of individualism and the decline of legitimacy of public \ninstitutions (see, e.g. Beck, 1992, 2000; Sennett, 1992). Coupled with globalization, \nthe weakening of the nation state and the rapid growth of information and communi-\ncation technologies, the culture of individualism keeps on redefining core characteris-\ntics of modernity. Though these developments remain far from being crystallized, \nthere is indeed some evidence to suggest that current socio-cultural and technological \nchanges converge to the redrawing of the prevailing boundaries of the private and \npublic world, work from leisure, family and community.2  \nUnder these conditions, the very forms by which individuals have traditionally \nbeen tied to social institutions are bound to change (Beck, 1992; Baumann, 1992, \nSennett, 1992, 2000). New forms of individual involvement in organizations (e.g. \nflexible and temporary forms of employment) develop to accommodate the shifts in \nsocial institutions, values and life styles mentioned above. At the same time informa-\ntion and communication technologies become an important agent of organizational \nand occupational change (Castells, 1996, 2001; Rifkin, 1995, 2000). The precise \nways, though, by which organization forms are connected to these developments re-\nmain a contested terrain. Neither the organizational forms nor the mechanisms that \nbring them about are sufficiently studied or clear. The appreciation of the impact of \nthese changes on the prevailing forms of organization would seem to require the seri-\nous reconsideration of the social institution of bureaucracy in ways that step beyond \nstereotyped images of it. \nLet it be clear that the critical attitude vis-\u00e0-vis the claims that announce the \ndemise of bureaucracy and the emergence of post-bureaucratic forms is not prompted \nby any dedicated commitment to the bureaucratic form of organization. The author \nneither condemns nor supports bureaucracy. Rethinking the foundations of bureauc-\nracy serves the purpose of disclosing the social, cultural and economic roots of this \ninstitution and appreciating its limits against the background of a wider historical un-\nderstanding. Undeniably, bureaucracy has entertained a number of tensions, most viv-\nidly shown in the contrast between the ideals of justice, meritocracy and egalitarian-\nism by which it has been legitimized and the centralized and often awful practices \nwith which it has been associated.  \nThe article is structured in the following way. Next section takes up the issue \nof rule-bound behaviour that is often seen as the epitome of bureaucracy. It shows that \nstandardization is a ubiquitous aspect of contemporary organizations that contrasts \nsharply with the assumed malleability and flexibility of post-bureaucratic organizing, \n                                                          \n2 Sennett (1992) suggests that the decline of the public world is a process that has been in the \nmaking for quite a long time. The roots of current developments, he claims, can be traced \nback to the nineteenth century. A similar, though differently, motivated claim can be ex-\ntracted from Hannah Arendt\u2019s influential book \u201cThe Human Condition\u201d. \n 4\ncalling for the careful reconsideration of the bureaucratic form. The following section \nundertakes precisely that task. Bureaucracy is identified with the non-inclusive cou-\npling of the individual to the organization consequent upon the separation of the role \nfrom the person. On the basis of this claim, the article ventures to dissociate bureauc-\nracy from the dominant connotation of an inflexible and rigid form. It shows that the \nnon-inclusive modulation of the individual organization relationship makes bureauc-\nracy the first and as yet sole organization form in which individuals are tied to organi-\nzations in selective, mobile and reversible terms. Such terms give the bureaucratic or-\nganization the possibility of addressing emerging contingencies. The final section of \nthe article attempts to show that the non-inclusive involvement of individuals into or-\nganizations is the primary matrix of relations out of which other derivative character-\nistics, often taken as the epitome of bureaucracy, such as standardization and \ncentralization, emerge. The article ends with a few concluding remarks. \n \nThe Ubiquitous Character of Standardization \nStandard conceptions of bureaucracy reflecting the Weberian legacy consider this or-\nganization form as a major social innovation, essential to the expansion of industrial \ncapitalism and the embeddedness of crucial social and economic goals or ideals such \nas progress, growth, meritocracy and egalitarianism. On this view, bureaucracy coin-\ncides with the advent of modernity, it is part and parcel of it (Gellner, 1983, 1996; \nLuhmann, 1982, 1995; Seyer, 1991). In organization studies, though, as Clegg (1994) \nhas observed, the term has been used in a narrower fashion. Organization theorists \ndefined bureaucracy in terms of a limited number of key characteristics and sought to \nexplore empirically the degree to which these characteristics were present in various \norganizations. According to such an understanding of bureaucracy, an organization \ncould emerge as more or less bureaucratic, depending on the intensity by which the \nkey characteristics of standardization, formalization, centralization and role and func-\ntional specialization were governing its operations (see, e.g., Hall, 1982; Pugh et al., \n1963, 1968; Scott, 1981). \n A reinterpretation of these studies suggests that the four or five dimensions \nused to describe the bureaucratic principles of organization could collapse into hier-\narchy and rule-bound behaviour as the epitomes of the bureaucratic form of organiza-\ntion. In one sense, rule-bound behaviour conveys even more than hierarchy the tradi-\ntional understanding of the bureaucracy as a system of routines and standard operating \nprocedures (Perrow, 1986). Rule bound behaviour is expressed in an elaborate social \nedifice of rules, routines and formal role systems stipulating job positions, duties and \njurisdictions and regulating interaction patterns. Rule-bound behaviour has often been \nseen to be at the heart of the behavioural mechanics governing bureaucracy. The \n 5\npopular and artistic distaste for bureaucracy derives by and large from this alleged \ndepersonalized functioning of formal organizations.  \n However, the historical background of the social relations out of which bu-\nreaucracy emerged suggests some important qualifications. Rule bound behaviour was \nfashioned to accommodate the functioning of modern organizations whose operations \ncould not any longer anchored in the normative certainty of gemeinschaft. Being ac-\ntive on a spatial and temporal scale that extended far beyond the limited world of pre-\nmodern communities, modern organizations needed both the legitimacy and new \nprinciples for controlling their operations. The construction of formal role systems for \nregulating human behaviour in organizations emerged as a historical innovation, es-\nsential in sustaining the egalitarian ethos of modern society. Formal role systems pro-\nvide transparent motives and legible behaviour, on the basis of which one can decide \nwhether citizens are treated equally and the employees of the organization protected \nfrom any abuse or arbitrary exercise of power (Perrow, 1986). By the same token, the \nbracketing of personal goals and the imposition of a formal order reflect the aware-\nness that the pursuit of personal ends within the context of an organization may well \nundermine the goals and the adequate functioning of an organization (du Gay, 1994, \n2000). The institutionalization of expectations and action patterns coinciding with \nrule-bound behaviour were thus an essential means for avoiding haphazard initiatives \nand opportunism, and improving the performance of public organizations.  \nDepersonalized behaviour is obviously not limited to public organizations. Al-\nthough it may have been originally occasioned by major ideals of the emerging bour-\ngeois society that were socially embedded through precisely the adequate functioning \nof state or public bureaucracies, the bureaucratic standardization of behaviour de-\nscribes the entire organizational landscape of modernity. In one form or another, de-\npersonalized conduct has been made to an indispensable principle of all formal orga-\nnizing in modernity. It has been applied with even greater severity in private firms \nand industrial organizations, where the design of jobs and the systems of surveillance \ntied to them emerged as the outcome of the relentless drive towards cost reduction, \nachieved through minute division of labour and economies of scale (Chandler, 1977). \nRather than simply regulating behaviour, industrial organizations sought to regulate \neven the minutest details of workers\u2019 bodily movements (Braverman, 1974; Noble, \n1984). Standardization in that sense has come close to betray the very ideals with \nwhich it has been associated. The inhuman, sometimes brutal, relations that prevailed \nin the industrial factories, in some cases as late as at the break of the Second World \nWar, are indeed hard to reconcile with the ideals of liberty and justice.  \nManagerialist thinking easily relegates the job designing principles of indus-\ntrial capitalism to the past, assuming that they are increasingly surpassed by important \n 6\ndevelopments in the market environment and the technological infrastructure of pro-\nduction (Womack and Jones, 1996). It would be indeed difficult to deny the crucial \norganizational importance of major economic and technological innovations. Con-\ntemporary technology, in particular, has through extended automation changed sig-\nnificantly the conditions of production in industrial firms and other contexts of eco-\nnomic activity (Kallinikos, 2001). However, the status of these changes at the shop \nfloor of the industrial factory and the outcome of these developments for the issue of \nbehavioural mechanics that concerns us here are not entirely clear. There exist a num-\nber of studies to suggest a rather mixed and at times negative picture of recent trends, \nindicating greater control of employees, intensification of work (Kling, 1996; Zuboff, \n1988) and novel forms of alienation (Carnoy, 2000; Harisson, 1994; Murray et al., \n2002; Sennett, 2000).  \nComputer and information technologies do not make up an unequivocal ally to \nflexible patterns of behaviour, as the exponents of the post-bureaucratic or entrepre-\nneurial form of organization often assume (Kallinikos 1998). The expanding organ-\nizational involvement of software packages might indeed contribute to the standardi-\nzation of behaviour. Software packages are currently major means for structuring and \norganizing work in contemporary organizations. They are most of the times conceived \nand constructed by specialized software developing companies, in contexts other than \nthose they are called upon to monitor. The construction of software packages by spe-\ncialized organizations indicates that they are initially responses to abstract definitions \nof problems. Without this requirement the very development of programs would be \nimpossible in the first place (Simon, 1969). \nThe increasing organizational involvement of de-contextualized systems of \nmanaging and monitoring information and the requirements of cross-contextual in-\nformation comparability impose standardization in the form of a quasi-universal lan-\nguage of information processing. Undeniably, the introduction of software packages \ninto organizations is a complex socio-technical process that involves deliberate and \nhaphazard modifications. It is well known that software packages can be reconfigured \nto fit the demands of specific contexts or used in ways that were never thought of at \nthe very moment of their inception (Ciborra, 2000). Yet the very substratum of soft-\nware packages that reflects the logicist premises on which they are built and the cog-\nnitive mechanics of symbol processing cannot be undone (Lackoff, 1995) by recon-\nfiguring or resisting the use and functionality of particular software packages. But \neven at the more macroscopic level of everyday work, software packages punctuate \nexperience and impose uniformity through:  \n\u2022 The standardized definition of problems (or problem spaces).  \n\u2022 The specification of the tasks that the problem thus defined involves. \n 7\n\u2022 The delineation of the procedural steps necessary to enact the logic of the \nsoftware package (Kling 1996; Zuboff 1988).  \n \nSoftware packages are thus far from innocent means that support organizational op-\nerations. Rather, the three categories of effects stated above and the very cognitive \nfoundations of software packages suggest that they hypostatize both meaning and ac-\ntion patterns. As perhaps any technology, software packages embody human experi-\nence, inviting particular modes of understanding and action that involve both the \nframing of the reality to be addressed, the determination of particular tasks and their \nsequential patterning. It is not by accident that information technology has now and \nthen being considered as a mechanized contemporary alternative to the rule-bound \nbehaviour of bureaucracy (e.g. Beniger, 1986).  \nInformation systems undeniably promote standardization, even though homo-\ngeneity and uniformity may not be their sole affects. Current technology also enables \na form of bricolage, exercised upon the huge number of information items and appli-\ncations that constitute the landscape of most contemporary organizations (Ciborra, \n2000). Software packages are in this way pregnant with various option possibilities \nthat are produced by the play of permutations to which the many information items \nunderlying them can enter. Also, the development of links across organizations allows \nfor the relatively easy crossing of institutional boundaries in ways that may promote \nalternative models of individual and organizational action (Castells, 2001). But these \nrather obvious effects should not hide the deep standardization of cognition and ac-\ntion, accomplished by the diffusion and organizational involvement of information \nsystems. Standardization goes underneath the surface flexibility enabled by current \ntechnology. It involves uniform procedures for problem definition and problem solv-\ning, imposed by automated models of cognition, as described above. It even entails \nthe standardization of interfaces, protocols and various hardware and software com-\nponents (Hanseth, 2000). The ubiquitous character of standardization in contemporary \nlife provides evidence in support of the claim that it cannot be made the exclusive ar-\nbiter of the bureaucratic form of organization. \nThe evidence that standardization represents a viable and widely diffused job \nand process design methodology is furthermore supported by the rapid and impressive \ndiffusion of the standards of the ISO series during the last two decades. It is obvious \nthat the ISO standards lead to rule-bound and standardized patterns of behaviour. But \nstandardization represents an ideal even in models of management underlying the en-\ntrepreneurial or network form of organization like for instance Total Quality Man-\nagement (TQM). Product quality in TQM models is by and large defined in terms of \nits capacity to conform to a set of pre-specified standards. Therefore, the careful de-\n 8\nsign of these standards as well as the standardization of the process by which the \nproduct (or a service) is produced represent the fundamental requirements for achiev-\ning this goal. Indeed, TQM is a methodology of predictability, achieved through the \nminute description of various work tasks and processes and carried out in ways that \ndemand active involvement of the employees of the organization throughout the pro-\nduction process (see, e.g. Womack and Jones, 1996). \nStandardization of behaviour seems furthermore to represent a viable job de-\nsign methodology in types or organizations that may be intuitively thought to repre-\nsent a contrast to the popular image of rigid bureaucracies. Everyday observations \nsuggest that organizations that are commonly assumed to be market-driven and cus-\ntomer targeting, like for instance airlines, banks or insurance companies, use standard-\nized and largely stylized modes of conduct in abundance. Standardized behaviour not \nonly continues to play a crucial role in many types of service organizations but some \nservice, \u201cconsumer-responding\u201d organizations have extended the regulative domain of \nstandardization, allowing it to shape such spontaneous behaviours such as smiling, \nwording, eye contact and other minute aspects of human conduct. \nIn sum, this brief review and re-contextualization of recent developments does \nnot lend immediate support to the liberal neo-romanticism of individual creativity and \ninitiative taking, following the decline of bureaucracy. Standardization is as ubiqui-\ntous as the very changes that may be taken to suggest the emergence of new forms of \norganization. There is a need, therefore, to turn to a more thorough and systematic \nstudy of bureaucracy. The current controversy between bureaucratic forms of organi-\nzation and its asserted alternatives must be placed in a wider and coherent framework \nthat may give it its appropriate meaning. \n \nThe Social Innovations of Bureaucracy \nThe bureaucratic form of organization is both the outcome of the wider social and cul-\ntural orientations of modernity and a major agent for institutionally embedding these \norientations. The contribution bureaucracy has historically made to this goal is most \nclearly manifested on the highly distinctive mode by which it came to regulate the in-\ndividual-organization relationship. For first time in history, an organization form sys-\ntematically decoupled the terms by which individuals were tied to organizations from \nconcrete persons (Weber, 1970, 1978). Supported by the wider anthropological orien-\ntations of modernity, bureaucracy dissociated the organizational role taking from so-\ncial position and the experiential totality that is commonly associated with the person-\nality or the particular mode of being of a person. It thus inaugurated a new structural \nprinciple by which individuals have come to be tied to organizations in terms other \nthan inclusive. Non-inclusiveness implies that individuals are not contained in organi-\n 9\nzations and these last are not made of the aggregate of persons but of roles and the \npatterns brought about by the interdependence of roles (Luhmann, 1995; Tsivacou, \n1997). The inescapable corporeality of the human condition should not be taken to \nimply that individuals enter organizations in their full-blown cognitive, emotional, \nand social complexity.  \nIt is crucial to appreciate the distinctive status of relations out of which bu-\nreaucracy emerges as the modern form of organization. The role, not the person, con-\nstitutes the fundamental structural and behavioural element of modern formal organiz-\ning. Organizations are not made of individuals distributed over a complex landscape \nof job positions but of patterns built by those abstract operational requirements we \ncall roles. Roles are enacted by the intrinsically modern capacity of contemporary \nhumans to systematically and consistently suspend all other personal or organizational \naspects that do not bear upon the role and to undertake action (e.g. machine operator, \naccountant, salesman, secretary etc.) along delimited and well-specified paths. The \nliving energy and the general communicative capacity of humans are essential re-\nsources for organizations (as it is for all social life) but this should not lead one to as-\nsume that formal organizations are made of individuals qua persons. \nBureaucracy thus introduces an abstract conception of work as a set of delim-\nited behavioural choices (i.e. duties) that can be dissociated from the totality of the \nlife world and from the distinctive mode of being of every person. A major objective \nand an important consequence of the bureaucratic modulation of the individual-\norganization relationship is that individuals join the organization on the basis of con-\nsiderations that relate to their ability to assume a role, i.e. on the basis of merits pro-\nvided by education, working experience, etc. At the same time, other aspects of an \nindividual\u2019s life are severed from bureaucratic regulation. The non-inclusive involve-\nment of individuals in organizations is sustained by the adequate differentiation of \nboth individual and social life. That is, the characteristics that derive from education, \nprofessional specialization and working experience cover only a part (admittedly a \nvery important one) of the totality of an individual\u2019s roles and projects. In the social \ncontext of modernity, other organizations and institutions that are clearly and unambi-\nguously differentiated from work organizations, e.g. family and community, represent \na crucial outlet of the individual\u2019s interests and activities. The segmentation of life \ninto separate and relatively independent spheres is an essential requirement for the \nforms of human involvement upon which bureaucracy is predicated (Kallinikos, \n2003). \nThe bureaucratic form and the non-inclusive way of modulating the individ-\nual-organization relationship coincided with the gradual dissolution of class stratifica-\ntion and the immobile, hereditary social relations characteristic of the late feudal \n 10\nworld (Gellner, 1983, 1996; Luhmann, 1982, 1995, 1996). Bureaucracy emerged as \nthe dominant modern organization form out of the overall rational and functional pre-\noccupations of modernity. However, the novel way of orchestrating the individual-\norganization relationship represented itself an important vehicle for constructing a \nnew organizational form, premised on universalism and meritocracy as major princi-\nples for realizing and embedding the bourgeois ideals of individual liberty and justice \n(du Gay, 2000). By standardizing the requirements of role performance and formaliz-\ning the process of role taking, the bureaucratic organization became the vehicle \nthrough which jobs became potentially available to anyone that fulfilled the require-\nments of job specification. It is through the very separation of the role from the person \nthat such an availability can be rendered possible and a labour contract be signed that \nmake the terms of the agreement legible and law enforceable (Weber, 1947, 1970, \n1978). \nBureaucracy and modernity are therefore inextricably bound up with one an-\nother. Bureaucracy is the organization form of modernity. It is closely associated with \nthe overall cultural orientations of modern man, the social mobility that coincided \nwith the gradual dissolution of pre-modern stratification, and the burgeoning bour-\ngeois ideals of individual freedom and justice, which it helped itself to embed. In this \nrespect, bureaucracy contrasts sharply with pre-modern forms of organizing that re-\nlied by and large on the principle of inclusion for regulating the relationship of people \nto organizations. The differentiation of personal, social and working aspects of iden-\ntity was elementary in the agricultural, feudal world. As a consequence these aspects \nof people\u2019s life could not be separated from one another, as it is the case in modernity \n(Gellner, 1983). In the pre-modern, segmentary societies, the social position \u2500defined \nby a fixed and basically immobile social stratification regulated and reproduced as a \nrule by hereditary relations\u2500 determined by and large the working identity of people. \nThe relatively open space of bourgeois democracy and the social mobility associated \nwith it formed the basic conditions for the emergence of the organizational form that \nWeber came gradually to designate as bureaucracy. \nThe far reaching significance of modulating the individual-organization rela-\ntionship in terms other than inclusive emerges clearly in the background of the com-\nparison of bureaucracy with the organizational form that Goffman (1961) once called \ntotal organizations, i.e. mental hospitals, prisons, monasteries, army barracks, reli-\ngious sects, etc. In contrast to the non-inclusive coupling of the individual to the or-\nganization underlying bureaucracy, total organizations are based on the structural \nprinciple of inclusion. Individuals are contained in the organization, they are in other \nwords \u201cinmates\u201d. Total organizations impose their austere order on the entire person-\nality of their members. They do not distinguish between personality and collective. \n 11\nThe term individual, as we know it, is alien to this form of organization. Total organi-\nzations thus provide an instructive contrast to bureaucracy. The latter may owe part of \nits administrative practices to the meticulous discipline worked out in the austere \nworld of monasteries (Mumford, 1934), yet an abysmal chasm separates the bureau-\ncratic organization from monasteries or other total organizations. Such a chasm is \nprecisely produced by the non-inclusive, conspicuously modern and abstract mode of \nregulating the individual-organization relationship. \nThe profound differences separating inclusive and non-inclusive modes of \nregulating the individual-organization relationship are perhaps obscured by the im-\npressive diffusion of the bureaucratic principles and the withdrawal of total organiza-\ntions to the fringes of modern everyday social encounters. Being the \u201cnormal\u201d yard-\nstick of functional ability and institutional legitimacy, bureaucracy and the non-\ninclusive modulation of the individual-organization relationship tend to be taken-for-\ngranted. Strange as it may seem at first glance, Foucault\u2019s (1977) highly innovative \nuse of panopticon (and the prison) may be taken to suggest total organizations as the \nmodel for understanding the modern organizational and institutional order. As indi-\ncated by the relevance which monastic life may have assumed for bureaucracy, there \nexist undeniably affinities in some of the forms and mechanisms by which these two \nwidely differing archetypes of organization assure compliance and construct confor-\nmity. However, despite these affinities, bureaucracy and total organizations differ in \nsome substantial ways. Modern discipline in institutional life presupposes the anthro-\npological distinction of the role from the person and the structural device that embeds \nsuch a distinction. Without such a separation, the objectification of one\u2019s contribu-\ntions and the self-monitoring along measurable or governable dimensions would be \nimpossible or, at least, hampered substantially. A careful reading of Foucault re-\nenhances this claim (Foucault, 1977, 1980, 1988). The tangle of behaviours, orienta-\ntions and techniques that constitute humans qua persons must be dissolved to become \nthe target of measurement, examination and control (Hasselbladh and Kallinikos, \n2000; Kallinikos, 1996).  \n \nSelectivity, Mobility and Reversibility \nDespite its commonsense and, to a certain degree, justified associations with rigid and \ninflexible behaviour, bureaucracy is the first and perhaps sole organizational form \ncapable of addressing the demands that incessant social, economic and technological \nchange induces. As already suggested, the organizational involvement of individuals \nqua roles implies the dissociation of the process of organizing from the emotional and \ncognitive complexity of agents qua persons. By contrast to persons, roles can be \nadapted, modified, redesigned, abandoned or reshuffled to address the emerging tech-\n 12\nnical, social and economic demands the organization is facing. The bureaucratic form \ncan thus shape the contributions of people without demanding basic changes in their \npersonality, other than those related to attitudes and skill mastery. This is precisely \naccomplished through the detailed design of roles and the rules tied to their perform-\nance. In this light, rule-bound behaviour is inter alia motivated by the project of \nadapting to contingent demands, rather than the other way around, which the conven-\ntional understanding of bureaucracy as simply routine seems to suggest. It remains of \ncourse a highly delicate issue to which extent organizational and social roles can be \nseverely decoupled from the totality that makes the distinctive mode of being of every \nhuman (Tsivacou, 1997). However, both bureaucracy and modern society were built \non the premise that such a severe or adequate separation is possible (Mangham, 1995; \nSennett, 2000).  \nThe cardinal bureaucratic premise of non-inclusiveness is bound to produce a \nrelationship of the individual to the organization that is marked by selectivity, mobility \nand reversibility (Gellner, 1983, 1996; Luhmann, 1982, 1995). Selectivity is the out-\ncome of the fundamental relation that individuals assuming organizational roles are \nexpected to suspend non-role demands and act on the basis of a well specified and \ndelimited set of criteria that constitute the role (job description and specification, du-\nties and jurisdictions, field of responsibility). The mobility in the individual-\norganization relationship is produced by the fact that a role, being an abstract set of \nfunctional requirements, can be unleashed from the particular circumstances into \nwhich it is embedded, and be transferred across various organizational contexts \n(Hassebladh and Kallinikos, 2000). Mobility is furthermore enhanced by the reversi-\nble terms of individual\u2019s involvement in organizations. Reversibility implies that jobs \ncan be altered or redesigned and the organizational sanctioning of job positions modi-\nfied or even withdrawn. The relationship is also reversible from the point of view of \nthe individual that can invoke several reasons for quitting an organization, even \nthough this may bring negative pecuniary or legal consequences. \nPlaced on the background of these observations, bureaucracy emerges as an al-\ntogether different institution from the conventional image that identifies bureaucratic \norganizational forms with a sort of behavioural mechanics and incapacity to change. \nIndeed, the demands of the current age for contingent (local and functionally adapt-\nable), mobile and reversible (temporary) patterns of behaviour cannot but be satisfied \nby an organization form that strengthens the bureaucratic premises whereby individu-\nals are tied to the organization in terms other than inclusive. Shorter time frames for \norganizational action, employment forms other than those implied by lifetime con-\ntracts, diffuse tasks that demand the constant redesigning of roles, virtual relations, all \n 13\npresuppose that individuals are coupled to organizations in terms that are character-\nized by selectivity, mobility and reversibility. \nAs construed here the modulation of the individual-organization relationship \nin selective, mobile and reversible terms represents the cornerstone of bureaucracy. \nHowever, while rule-bound behaviour and role specialization can be directly associ-\nated with the selective, mobile and reversible terms by which individuals are coupled \nto organizations, it is not entirely clear how the hierarchical constitution of bureauc-\nracy that represents one of its crucial attributes can be related to these terms. Hierar-\nchy is though a pervasive trans-cultural and trans-historical characteristic that cannot \nbe exclusively attributed to bureaucracy (Dumont, 1967). What is perhaps distinctive \nin the hierarchical configuration of bureaucratic organization is the relative clear and \nrule-bound regulation of the exercise of authority. The jurisdictional domain of au-\nthority is specified and delimited while its exercise is governed by rules to constitute \nwhat Weber (1947) referred to as rational-legal authority. The delimited and rule-\nbound regulation of authority is precisely the outcome of the selective, mobile and \nreversible terms of modulating the individual-organization relationship. Authority is \ntied to the office (i.e. the role), exercised upon a specific domain of organizational \noperations while its organizational sanctioning can be withdrawn at every moment.  \nThe understanding of bureaucracy in the terms described so far represents no \ndoubt but a very concise description of the complex social and cultural processes un-\nderlying it. The interpretation of bureaucracy solely in terms by which individuals are \ntied to organization leaves out of consideration vital social and cultural processes that \nsustain the bureaucratic form of organization and other modern institutions. It has al-\nready been noted that a number of factors contributed to the emergence and diffusion \nof the bureaucratic organization and the ability to modulate the individual-\norganization relationship in a non-inclusive fashion. Crucial among them were the \ndecoupling of the social status of individuals from their position in the system of pro-\nduction, the consequent social mobility brought about by bourgeois democracy and \nthe relatively clear separation of private life from the public world. Closely related to \nthese changes were the development of capitalism and market economy. Other crucial \nfactors involved the very anthropological foundations of individualism and the subtle \ncultural shifts by means of which the world was increasingly understood as the very \nobject of human intentions and calculability and rationality were rendered the univer-\nsal mode of cognition (Heidegger, 1977). The modulation, therefore, of the individ-\nual-organization relationship in selective, mobile and reversible terms evolves within \nthe wider context of a social and cultural universe that we here cannot but take largely \nfor granted. \n \n 14\nThe Double Articulation of Bureaucracy  \nIf bureaucracy is not precisely the rigid organization form commonly assumed then \nhow are we to interpret many contemporary trends that seem to suggest the emer-\ngence of forms of organization that depart, in one way or another, from the standard \nbureaucratic version that dominated modernity? Virtual organization, network models \nof organization, forms of employment other than those implied by stable, clear-cut job \narrangements and lifetime contracts, and flexible production systems can all be in-\nvoked as major cases that break with the classical bureaucratic principles of organiza-\ntion.3 Do not these examples really suggest bureaucracy to be on the verge of \nconcluding its historical circle?  \n                                                          \nAn important corollary that emerges from the preceding analysis is that stan-\ndardized behaviour represents a ubiquitous element of all modern organizing that \nseems unlikely to be suspended by the trends subsumed under such catchwords as \nnetwork, virtual or entrepreneurial forms of organization. Standardization is essential \nto all non-haphazard human action and communication that transcend the limits of \nparticular contexts (Hasselbladh and Kallinikos, 2000). As a consequence, organiza-\ntion forms that claim some sort of context independence and universality cannot but \nexhibit at least a minimum of standardization. A second and perhaps more crucial in-\nsight following the analysis undertaken in the preceding pages concerns the relation of \nstandardization to flexibility and the dissociation of bureaucracy from standardiza-\ntion. The bureaucratic form of organization cannot be simply equated with routines \nand standard operating procedures, no mater how important or ubiquitous they happen \nto be. Standardized behaviour constitutes the substratum, as it were, by which organ-\nizational action is made of. Routines, procedures and roles are the elements of an \norganizational ars combinatoria capable of constantly reassembling these elements to \naddress the ceaseless emergence of contingencies, underlying the contemporary con-\ndition. \nThe far-reaching consequences of the modular constitution of bureaucracy \nemerge against the background of the metaphorical associations provided by standard-\nized notation such as alphabetic writing or music notation (Kallinikos, 1996). The \nability to bring together the characters of a notational system to various combinations \nis ultimately dependent on the standardization of every character and its clear distinc-\n3 Some other trends that can be tied to the decline of the bureaucratic forms involve the so-\ncalled de-institutionalisation of psychiatric care and the care for the disabled and the elderly. \nHowever, rather than signifying the end of bureaucracy these trends represent the decline of \nan organized practice that is by and large associated with total organizations as described in \nthe preceding pages. Indeed, de-institutionalisation in these cases implies that mental patients, \ndisabled and elderly are redefined in terms that transform them from inmates to individuals \ntied to organizations of the welfare state in selective, mobile and reversible forms. In other \nwords, de-institutionalisation represents a trend toward rather than away from bureaucracy. \n 15\ntion from other characters. Unless the standardization and finite differentiation of the \nnotational elements of a system are accomplished, no rules can be worked out to gov-\nern their combinations (Goodman, 1976). A notational system that is composed of \nelements that dissolve into their substratum or melt constantly into one another eludes \nsemiosis, and betrays the very purpose that it is supposed to serve (Kallinikos, 1996). \nStandardization forms a fundamental condition for the huge number of combinations \n(certainly under a number of constraints) that the standardized elements of a system \ncan enter. Looked upon this way, standardization is a prerequisite for semiotic flexi-\nbility. Any system that is based on similar principles of architecture is bound to ex-\nhibit behavioural or semiotic flexibility. \nTo avoid however, the conspicuous logicist associations that could arise from \nthe comparison of organizational action with symbolic notation (Simon, 1969), we \ncould pursue the analogy of bureaucracy with one of the most complex and resilient \ninstitutions of social life, namely natural language. The picture of bureaucracy painted \nin this article suggests that the bureaucratic form of organization could be conceived \nas being governed by what structuralists once called the principle of double articula-\ntion of language.4 Like language (phonemes), bureaucracy is composed, at a first \nlevel, by a fairly standardized number of elements (e.g. routines, tasks, procedures, \nroles) that, seen separately from one another, may convey the impression of fixed and \nlimited population of behaviours, devoid of meaning or signification. This is precisely \nproduced by the ability to bring these elements together to various larger patterns (i.e. \nthe second level) that acquire meaning and purpose due to their capacity to respond to \nemerging social projects. The abstract character of the organizational architecture that \ncoincides with the double articulation of bureaucracy contrasts sharply with the read-\nily observable reality of routines and standardized procedures and may perhaps be \nheld responsible for the widely diffused association of bureaucracy with standardiza-\ntion and rigidification.  \nThe many configurations that can be produced by a system organized in a way \nresembling the double articulation of natural language provide indeed an indication of \nthe enormous potential such a system disposes for adapting to changing conditions. \nThrough reshuffling and recombination and occasional redesign of its elements the \nsystem becomes capable of addressing emerging situations that may demand re-\nsponses different from those the system has produced so far. Despite the many con-\nstraints that may be thought to underlie the combinability of the elements (Kallinikos, \n                                                          \n4 The principle of double articulation conceives of language as being composed of two levels. \nThe first level entails those elements of language that lack immediate meaning like phonemes \nand combinations of phonemes that do not reach the level of word where meaning first ap-\npears. Words, sentences, discourses are all meaningful elements whose substratum is made of \nnon-menaningful phomemes (Barthes, 1967; Ricouer, 1977). \n 16\n1996, 1998) a huge number of combinations are indeed available that may give the \norganization a broad repertoire of structural and behavioural options. The quest for \nflexibility cannot therefore be addressed in a genuine fashion unless contemporary \nforms of organization are built on the very foundations of bureaucracy as outlined in \nthis text. Only by being able to reassemble the standardized elements by which it is \nmade of, to produce new configurations (i.e. products, services, action patterns, etc.), \ncan an organization hope to cope with the constant jumping up of contingencies. A \nprerequisite for doing so is to allow individuals to be tied to systems in selective, mo-\nbile and reversible forms. \nThe organizational involvement of humans qua roles makes bureaucracy ca-\npable of unleashing the process of organizing from the inescapable context-\nembeddedness of the human body and the intractable complexity of experiences that \nunderlie human beings qua persons. In so doing, it sets the premises for a form of or-\nganization free from the restricted mobility of the human body and the languid proc-\ness of personal and psychological reorientation. Bureaucracy\u2019s abstract principles of \norganization are the hull out of which virtual relations are bound to emerge. Virtual \norganization is indeed contained as a germ in the very separation of the role from the \nperson, and the design and enactment of action patterns that are only loosely coupled \nto the corporeality and psychological complexity of humans (Baudrillard, 1983, \n1988). The social and psychological conditions necessary for the emergence of bu-\nreaucracy give an indication of the profound institutional change necessary to build \nformal organizations on premises other than those implied by bureaucracy.  \nThe claims advanced so far do not necessarily deny some crucial perhaps dif-\nferences that seem to be underlying the institutional context (late modernity) into \nwhich many organizations currently operate. We mentioned in the introduction sev-\neral factors (e.g. frequent economic and technological change, individualism and \nglobalization) that distinguish the current environment into which most organizations \noperate from the asserted stability of bureaucratic contexts. It is a widespread assump-\ntion that these factors drive the current shift away from the bureaucratic form of or-\nganizations. However, such an assumption makes sense only if bureaucracy is identi-\nfied with a rigid and inflexible organization form. Placed against the background of \nthe preceding analysis, such an interpretation of the organizational order of modernity \nemerges as regretfully inadequate. The fast pace and unpredictability of social, eco-\nnomic and technological change make indeed necessary the strengthening or elabora-\ntion (rather than the abandonment) of the social and organizational innovations intro-\nduced by modernity and bureaucracy. The mobile, selective and reversible relations \nsuch innovations promote constitute the sine qua non, the virtual matrix, as it were, \nout of which concrete instantiations addressing specific set of circumstances emerge. \n 17\nThere will be certainly occasions of radical environmental change that may \nrequire the reinvention and redefinition of the primary organizational substratum of \nroutines, standard operating procedures and roles rather than their sheer recombina-\ntion. New technologies produce a different segmentation of organizational tasks. This \npossibility is undeniably present. The comparison of language with forms of organiza-\ntion is, after all, metaphorical. However, in the social realm of organizations, the de \nnovo invention of the entire population of jobs, positions and procedures is a rather \nrare case and is not supported by empirical facts. Most of the times, novel situations \nwould be possible to cope with a complementary elaboration (elimination or addition \nof new roles, jobs and procedures) of a basic population of primary elements and the \nreassembling of these into new configurations. Other times, the comprehensive re-\nmaking of the first organizational substratum itself may not have far-reaching impli-\ncations as it may seem at first glance. The remaking of organizational tasks, roles and \nprocedures in such cases is based on a very similar logic for segmenting and structur-\ning the totality of organizational work. Flexible manufacturing represents a case in \npoint, producing its allegedly customized products through variable standardization of \na basic population of components reassembled into final products or services. Con-\ntemporary architecture too nowadays produces variable design forms by exploring the \npossibilities of recombining a population of standardized building components (Kal-\nlinikos, 2001). \nOn the other hand, the shorter time frames of change and the criss-crossing of \nthe organizational horizon by contingencies of various sorts threaten undeniably to \nshatter the modular constitution of bureaucracy into the very pieces by which it is \ncomposed. But it is of utmost important to uphold that the centrifugal forces produced \nby incessant change arise precisely out of bureaucracy\u2019s capacity to respond to the \nemerging contingencies and not by its inability to act in novel ways.  \n \nConstitutive and Variable Characteristics \nThe claims advanced so far inevitably lead to the crucial issue concerning the prem-\nises by which a system controls itself. Before an organization decides to redefine and \nreorganise its constitutive elements to produce novel responses to the contingencies it \nconfronts, it needs a mechanism for detecting and handling contingencies. Informa-\ntion must be gathered, processed and transmitted throughout the system. Decisions \nbased on information must be timely made, communicated and transformed to courses \nof action. Questions of this sort are coped with by means of the distribution of author-\nity and responsibility (centralization). A claim that is often made against the bureau-\ncratic form of organization is that the propagation of information and decisions \nthroughout the system is considerably retarded and often distorted by the hierarchical \n 18\norder of bureaucracies. The centralized bureaucratic practices of decision-making and \ncontrol do not allow for the effective transmission of information while they inhibit \ninitiative taking at the local level. Only a loosely coupled system with multiple loci of \ncontrol, distributed throughout its various operations, is capable of coping with the \nsudden turns or contingencies that currently face most organizations (e.g. Heckscher \nand Donnellon, 1994; Tsoukas, 1996).  \nThere is no doubt that the distribution of control plays an important role in de-\nfining a system\u2019s behaviour. But again the claim concerning the limited adaptability \nof the bureaucratic form makes sense on the background of the tacit assumption that \nbureaucracy is governed by a high and largely invariable degree of centralization. \nHowever, the development and very diversity of the modern organizational landscape \ntells another story. Centralization exhibits a highly variable degree throughout the his-\ntory of modernity and across the highly differentiated contexts underlying it (see, e.g. \nChandler, 1977). Little wonder, similar issues preoccupied organization theorists dur-\ning the first two or three decades following the Second World War. Various studies \ndocument variable degrees of (de)centralization and delegation of authority. Unpre-\ndictable contingencies and ambiguous situations lead to decentralized patterns of ac-\ntion and flexible modes of operation (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Perrow, 1967) seg-\nmentation and loose coupling (Galbraith, 1973; Simon, 1969; Weick, 1979) and not \ninfrequently to the idiosyncratic patterns of behaviour March and Olsen (1976) sum-\nmarized with the suggestive term \u201corganized anarchies\u201d. It may not have been by ac-\ncident that none of these authors ever claimed to have discovered the foundations of a \nnew organizational order. Furthermore, de(centralization) takes various forms. Decen-\ntralized initiative taking in certain domains may well go hand in hand with centraliza-\ntion in other domains. For instance, operational decisions may well be decentralized \nwhile crucial decisions subjected to increasingly tighter control and regulation \n(Power, 2002). The net outcome of similar patterns are hard to predict and even \nharder to measure and have their relative significance weighed in empirical contexts.  \nThe fact that formal organizations exhibit a variable centralization suggests \nthat the issue of the distribution of the loci of decisions may be difficult to make the \nsole criterion for the demise of bureaucracy and the assumed emergence of alternative \nforms of organization. Neither the issue of centralization-distribution of authority nor \nthat of standardization can be made the yardstick for deciding the limits of the bu-\nreaucratic form. No matter how important, these characteristics develop within the \nconstitutive framework of relations established by the non-inclusive forms of human \ninvolvement and the selective, mobile and reversible terms by which individuals are \ntied to organizations. These terms form the very foundation of the bureaucratic or-\nganization. They constitute the primary relation out of which other secondary or de-\n 19\nrivative characteristics emerge. It is important to uphold the distinction between pri-\nmary and derivative characteristics. Routines and standardized behaviour and cen-\ntralization are undeniably important yet derivative characteristics of the bureaucratic \norganization. They emerge on the very foundation, established by the clear separation \nof the individual from the organization, and the selective, mobile and reversible terms \nby which individuals are tied to organizations. \nThe cardinal importance of the modular, non-inclusive mode for regulating the \nindividual-organization relationship comes forward on the background of another \nfundamental relation. That is, the non-inclusive mode represents the outcome of a \nchoice that involves a binary alternation (Kallinikos, 1988; Luhmann, 1995; Tsivacou \n1997). Either you have an inclusive or non-inclusive mode of regulating the individ-\nual-organization relationship. It is impossible or, perhaps more correctly, inconse-\nquential to have little of the former and little of the latter. It may be possible to have \ndifferent modes regulating separate aspects of an organization but each aspect can be \nregulated only by one mode. We referred above to total organizations that regulate the \nlife of inmates through an inclusive, non-modular relationship. However, administra-\ntion in say prisons or mental hospitals is organized according to the non-inclusive, \nmodular relationships and administrative staff occupies and enacts distinctive roles. \nThe selection of either of the two alternatives introduces a code that brings to being a \nvery distinctive mode of organization. By contrast to this binary choice, characteris-\ntics like standardization and centralization exhibit a graded intensity. It is always pos-\nsible to have more or less standardization or centralization. In this sense neither of \nthese characteristics can become the ultimate arbiter for deciding whether an organ-\nizational form is bureaucratic or not.  \nThese claims therefore suggest that it is necessary to make a distinction be-\ntween constitutive and variable characteristics. The non-inclusive mode of human in-\nvolvement in organizations provides the fundamental condition on the basis of which \nit is possible to decide whether a form of organization is bureaucratic or not. The sig-\nnificance of variable characteristics, by contrast, develops within the framework es-\ntablished by the constitutive function of the non-inclusive mode of human involve-\nment in organizations. Variable characteristics precisely allow for distinguishing con-\ntextual variation of the basic bureaucratic form. \n \nCoda \nThe interpretation of bureaucracy suggested in the present article undeniably involves \na broad interpretation as to what counts as this organization form. In the final analysis, \nit tends to identify modernity with bureaucracy. A clear consequence of such an inter-\npretation is to consider the overwhelming majority of formal organizations as bureau-\n 20\ncratic, differing only in terms of a number of secondary characteristics such as stan-\ndardization and centralization.  \nBroad as it may be, the interpretation of bureaucracy advanced in this article is \nindeed much closer to the spirit of Weber\u2019s work, despite some ambiguity present in \nhis writings, as regards the place and the significance assigned to routine, standard-\nized work (Weber, 1947, 1978). It is even closer to the spirit of the writings of authors \nthat have in one way or another contributed to our understanding of modernity and \nbureaucracy such as Smith, Marx or even Durkheim. Terms like \u201cdivision of labour\u201d, \n\u201cexchange value of labour\u201d, \u201cabstract or dead labour\u201d \u201ccommodification of labour\u201d \ndescribe the abstractions of modern conditions of work. They bear strong resemblance \nto the concepts that were used here to describe the non-inclusive modular foundation \nof bureaucracy, namely selectivity (division of labour), mobility (commodification of \nlabour) and reversibility (exchange value). The institutionalization of property rights \nand the expropriation of the workers from the means of production (Marx, 1865, \n1867\/1954, 1956) is just one expression of the fundamental relations we attempt here \nto describe with the notion of modular, non-inclusive way of regulating the individ-\nual-organization relationship.  \nThe broad interpretation of bureaucracy suggested here is triggered by the al-\nleged prospect of its demise and the current historical junction that seems to be induc-\ning the global re-evaluation of modernity and certain of its key characteristics. The \nassumption of the conclusion of an age and the decline of its basic forms of organiza-\ntion inevitably prompt the examination of the very foundations on which such forms \nrest. The present article however suggests that only the substantial redefinition of the \ncore, constitutive properties of bureaucracy that were here identified with the non-\ninclusive forms of human involvement in organizations can really break with the insti-\ntutional principles bureaucracy embodies and embeds.  \nSecond or late modernity seems at present to provide contradictory signals as \nto wither it wishes to go. On the one hand, the flexibilization of work moves defi-\nnitely into the direction of making selectivity, mobility and reversibility even more \npronounced than what they have been up to the recent past. On the other hand, there \nemerge institutional practices that seek to involve individuals in organizations in \nterms that tend to blur the modern distinction between professional and personal life. \nFamily becomes a burden to professional development while crucial personal charac-\nteristics like sexual appeal and attractiveness, reserved once for the realm of intimacy, \nare increasingly and systematically brought to bear on the accomplishment of organ-\nizational objectives. Long hours of work further weaken an already fragile community \nand public life (Murray et al., 2002). These trends seem to suggest that the boundaries \nof the institutional separation of the work, family and community that sustained the \n 21\nnon-inclusive involvement of individuals to organizations tend increasingly to blur \n(Carnoy, 1992; Sennett, 2000). Elements reminiscent of the inclusive forms of human \ninvolvement in organizations re-emerge out of a past that seemed only distant and pa-\nrochial as late as two decades ago. Some of these trends are analyzed in Kallinikos \n(2003) but they are of such dignity as to demand a thorough treatment in the future. \nPerhaps the organization forms and work practices of second modernity will involve \ncombinations that seemed impossible and inconsequential from the horizon of first \nmodernity.  \n \nReferences \nAdorno, Theodore & Horkheimer, Max (1972) The Dialectic of Enlightment.
