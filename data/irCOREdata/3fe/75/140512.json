Introduction\nThe semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) requires that stock\nprices should fully reflect all publicly available information implying that investment\nstrategies based on fundamental information e.g. financial ratios or economic\nindicators should not be able to offer abnormal returns, under a risk neutrality\nassumption1 (Fama, 1991). There are several studies that have documented the\npredictive value of information available in financial statements in the US equity\nmarket. For instance, Ou and Penman (1989) develop a single summary measure that\nis capable of providing one-year-ahead earnings forecasts. Further evidence is\nprovided by Holthausen and Larcker (1992), who find that financial ratio analysis is\nuseful in predicting stock returns. Whilst Holthausen and Larcker (1992) utilise a\nlarge number of financial ratios in testing predictability of stock returns, Lev and\nThiagarajan (1993) use only twelve financial ratios and demonstrate that the ratios\nvery well correlate with returns after controlling for earnings innovations, firm size\nand macroeconomic conditions. Amongst other studies, Frankel and Lee (1998)\nenquire the usefulness of analyst-based valuation model in predicting cross-section of\nstock returns whilst Abarbanell and Bushee (1998) examine how fundamental signals\ngenerated by the financial statement data provide information for predicting future\nearnings changes in the US stocks. Using the same context, Nissim and Penman\n(2001) provide rigorous evidence on the utility of accounting ratios in projecting\nfuture streams of abnormal earnings. Similarly, Lewellen (2004) also reports evidence\n1 Under risk aversion one should account for a risk variable in the model tested, since variables found\nto be significant in predicting stock returns but also are correlated with risk, lose their significance\nwhen the model is adjusted for risk.\n3that financial ratios have strong forecasting power on stock returns calculated during\n1963-2000 period.\nThe literature that has used data from markets other than the US has also been\ngrowing. Cheung, Chung and Kim (1997) use a sample of Hong-Kong firms and\nexamine the relative and incremental usefulness of book-to-price and earnings-to-\nprice ratios for predicting stock returns. Martinez (1999) examines the association\nbetween financial ratios and stock returns for fifty industrial firms traded in the\nFrench stock market and confirms that financial statement information helps in\npredicting stock returns. In another study, Canbas, Duzakin, and Kilic (2002) indicate\nthat financial data is useful in improving the quality of fundamental analysis for stock\nvaluation in the Turkish stock exchange. In addition, Abekah (2005) investigates the\nemerging Ghana stock market and provides evidence on the predictability of stock\nreturns using fundamental accounting variables.\nThe main objective of this paper is to examine predictability of the cross-\nsection of stock returns in the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) using accounting\ninformation. Specifically, the paper employs panel data analysis to investigate the\nrelationship between stock returns and selected financial ratios for forty-seven firms\ntraded in the ASE over the period 1993-2006. Further, the paper examines whether\nwinner portfolios formed on the basis of previously determined financial ratios\nproduce excess returns. Any evidence of abnormal returns on winner portfolios would\nprovide evidence against the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis which requires\nthat stock prices should fully incorporate publicly available information such as those\ncontained in the financial statements.\nThere is relatively much less work on return predictability and performance of\ninvestment strategies using fundamental information in the Greek market. As far as\n4we are aware, there is no previous study that has tested the semi-strong form of\nefficient market hypothesis using publicly available accounting data in the Athens\nStock Exchange. However, there are a number of studies that have tested the weak\nform of the efficient market hypothesis. For example, Antoniou et al (2004)\ninvestigate availability of contrarian profits by testing the market overreaction\nhypothesis by using data from the ASE. Further, Galariotis (2004) investigates\nprofitability of short-term contrarian profits and their sources. He uses Jegadeesh and\nTitman (1995) methodology but annually rebalances size-sorted sub-samples and\nfinds evidence of short-run contrarian profits in the ASE. His findings suggest that\nthough both underreaction to common factors and overreaction to the firm-specific\nreturn component appear to contribute to profits, the contribution of overreaction is\nmuch larger than that of underreaction. Theriou et al (2005) tests the applicability of\nthe CAPM as well as firm specific factors. They employ Fama and French (1992)\nmodel using data from July 1993 to June 2001 and report that beta is not able to\nexplain returns in the ASE. Patra and Poshakwale (2008) provide evidence on short-\nrun and long-run relationship amongst the main stock indexes in the ASE and find\nthat changes in the banking sector index could be used in predicting changes in most\nother indexes confirming that the ASE is not weak form efficient.\nThus the literature survey suggests that whilst predictive power of accounting\ndata has been extensively researched for developed markets such as the US, evidence\non the emerging markets in general and the emerging Greek stock market in particular\nis scarce. This paper fills the gap in the existing literature by examining the\npredictability of stock returns based on accounting information in the emerging Greek\nstock market. The study is a first to use publicly available accounting information in\ntesting the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis in the emerging Greek stock\n5market. Using panel data analysis on data for 47 non-financial firms over for 1993-\n2006, the paper finds that the selected financial ratios contain significant information\nuseful for predicting the cross-section of stock returns. Further findings suggest that\nwinner portfolios formed on the basis of past financial ratios, produce higher than\naverage returns thus violating the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis in the\nemerging Greek stock market.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and\nthe methodology. Section 3 reports the empirical results whilst Section 4 concludes.\n2. Data and methodology\n2.1 Data description\nThe data used in the present study comprise annual stock prices and financial ratios\nfor a sample of forty-seven Greek firms listed on the ASE for the period 1993 to\n2006. Data on all 47 firms were available only from 1993 and therefore we were\nconstrained in selecting the sample period. All selected firms have been continuously\ntrading during the sample period and are representative of the Greek market. Financial\ninstitutions and banks have been excluded from the sample because of differences in\naccounting practices and types of financial ratios used, compared to industrial firms.2\nIn Greece, the fiscal year ends in December every year and therefore to ensure that\nannual accounting information is publicly available as defined by the Efficient Market\nHypothesis; June has been selected as the observation month3. The six month lag after\nthe fiscal year-end allows for any possible delays in publication of financial\nstatements by the Greek firms. Finally, the data used in this study were obtained from\nthe ASE database from 1993-2006, which includes several \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d periods.\n2 Cross sectional asset pricing studies typically exclude financial firms because of their high leverage\nand relatively greater industry regulations (see for example Fama and French (1992) among others).\n3 Annual financial data (December 31) of the Greek listed firms are reported by the end of March every\nyear and the General Assemblies in which financial data are approved take place before the end of June\nand there is no evidence that financial data before and after the General Assembly differs.\n6We select ten financial ratios as shown in Table 1. The selection of ratios was\nbased on the consideration these key ratios are commonly used by financial analysts\nin determining profitability, asset utilization, liquidity, and capital structure, and\nwhich capture the performance of a firm. Further, previous literature has also\nidentified that these ratios are significant in predicting stock market returns in the\ncross-sectional setting (inter alia Martinez, 1999).\n2.2 Methodology\nThe study uses panel data analysis that has several advantages.4 First, by combining\nthe time series and cross sectional dimensions, panel data sets provide greater\ninformation, more variability, less collinearity among variables, more degrees of\nfreedom and more analytical efficiency. Second, panel data can identify and measure\neffects that are not detectable in pure cross-section or pure time series analysis. Third,\nby studying repeated cross-section observations, panel data offers insights into the\ndynamics of change.\nWe consider the following dynamic panel data regression model:\nitittiit uRR \uf02b\uf043\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d \uf062\uf064 1, i =1,\u2026,47 t =1,\u2026,12 (2)\nitiitu \uf065\uf061 \uf02b\uf03d\nwhere firms are indicated by i and time by t. itR is the log return for firm i in year t,\ncalculated as the difference of logarithmic prices between periods t and t-1, i.e. Rt =\nln(Pt)-ln(Pt-1). Xit is the vector of explanatory variables, and itu is the error term where\ni\uf061 and it\uf065 are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated with zero mean and constant\nvariance over time.\n4 See Baltagi (1996). However, Panel data is not without possible drawbacks. Problems that originate\nfrom cross-section and time series data such as heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation can also affect\nthe panel data analysis (Gujarati, 2003).\n7The presence of a lagged dependent variable among the regressors and the\npotential endogeneity of the explanatory variables render both fixed-effects and\nrandom- effects estimators inconsistent. Specifically, Nickell (1981) has shown that\nfixed-effect estimator is biased (for large N and small T) because within\ntransformation induces a correlation of order 1\/T between the lagged dependent\nvariable and the error. Further, the possible endogeneity of the included variables may\narise because of the bidirectional causality between stock returns and certain\nexplanatory variables. This implies that the error term in equation (2) is correlated\nwith the endogenous regressors, and thus standard estimation procedures lead to\nseriously biased coefficients.\nThe regression equation is estimated by using the Generalised Method of\nMoments (GMM) specification proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) that controls\nfor the endogeneity of the explanatory variables and produces consistent estimators\n(Hansen and Singleton 1982). Specifically, the dynamic equation is first differenced\nto eliminate the individual effects and then it is estimated by instrumental variables\nusing as instruments lagged values for the dependent and independent variables. Since\nthe number of instruments is greater than the number of parameters, the estimated\nequation is overidentified. The validity of the instrument set is tested by using the\nSargan (1964) test for overidentifying restrictions.\nBefore estimating equation (2) we examine the stationarity properties of the\ndata series. A number of different panel unit root tests have been proposed by\nMaddala and Wu (1999), Choi (2001), Levin, Lin and Chu (2002), and Im, Pesaran\nand Shin (2003). All previous tests evaluate the null hypothesis of unit roots while the\nHadri (2000) test examines the null hypothesis that all of series in the panel are\nstationary. We therefore use both Hadri (2000) and Im, Pesaran and Shin (2003) tests.\n83. Empirical Results\n3.1 Unit root tests\nTable 2 reports the results of panel unit root tests proposed by Hadri (2000) and Im,\nPesaran and Shin (2003). For the level series, all variables except PER and PBV are\nnon stationary in the panel. However, for the first differenced series, there is no\nstatistical evidence of presence of a unit root.\n3.2 Panel estimation\nEmpirical results of the panel data analysis are given in Table 3 where estimates of\nthe model for each of the cross-sections are presented for three sub-periods i.e., 1993-\n2003, 1993-2004, and 1993-2005. The division of full sample period into three sub-\nperiods is based on the bull and bear periods that were observed in the Athens stock\nexchange. The findings reveal that the estimated coefficients of NPM, ROA and DA\nare not statistically significant in each of the three periods reported and were thus\neliminated.5 However, consistent with the literature, liquidity ratios (asset turnover,\ncurrent ratio) and profitability ratios (operating profit margin, return on equity) are\nsignificant and have a positive relationship with stock returns. The estimated sign for\nthe price\/earning ratio is negative indicating that companies with higher P\/E ratios\n(growth stocks) appear to have lower estimated returns compared to companies with\nlow P\/E ratios (value stocks). Results confirm the expected negative association of\nbetween leverage (debt\/equity ratio) and price to book ratio with the stock returns. We\nalso test the validity of the instrument set used in the panel data equation using the\nSargan test. The test results do not reject the null hypothesis that the over-identifying\nrestrictions are valid.\n5 The elimination of these variables has been done in stages. In particular, the variable that was first\neliminated was the one with the smallest absolute t-statistic. Then we re-estimated the model and\nselected next variable for elimination on the basis of the lowest t-statistic.\n93.3 Investment Strategies\nNext, the estimated parameters of equation (2) are used in formation of winner and\nloser portfolios for 2004, 2005, and 2006. Portfolios are constructed as follows. First,\nthe estimated coefficients of the selected model from 1993-2003 are multiplied by the\nregressors for cross-section 2004 to estimate the 2004 returns. Next, the stocks are\nranked according to their estimated returns and portfolios that consist of 10 stocks\n(20% of the sample) with the highest returns (winner portfolio) and 10 stocks with the\nlowest returns (loser portfolio) are constructed. The portfolios for 2005 and 2006 are\nconstructed similarly using the data from 1993-2004 and 1993-2005. The empirical\nresults of the investment strategy are presented in Table 4 and Figure 1.\nThe results displayed via Figure 1 show the performance of portfolios\nconstructed from the 10 stocks with the highest returns and the lowest returns for\nyears 2004, 2005, and 2006. The winner portfolios outperform the loser portfolios for\nall three years. Notably over 2004-2006 period, the winner portfolio has a cumulative\npositive return of 62.77% in contrast to cumulative negative return of 11.59% for the\nloser portfolio. This suggests that an investment strategy that buys winner portfolios\nand sells loser portfolios generates annual excess returns of 32.87%, 22.97%, and\n18.52%. The results are consistent with the majority of empirical studies on developed\ncapital markets (inter alia, see Lev and Thiagarajan (1993)).\n4. Conclusions\nThis paper provides empirical evidence against the semi-strong efficient market\nhypothesis in the emerging Greek stock market under the assumption of risk neutrality\nand by using publicly available accounting information. Using data for 47 firms over\n1993-2006 from the Athens Stock Exchange, the study analyses the panel data to\ninvestigate whether fundamental information as reflected in the financial ratios is able\n10\nto explain stock returns. Further, the paper also examines the performance of\ninvestment strategy based on going long in winner portfolios and shorting loser\nportfolios that were formed on the basis of past financial ratios.\nThe empirical findings suggest that the selected financial ratios contain\nimportant information in predicting the cross-section of stock returns in the ASE. The\ninvestment strategy that involves buying winner portfolios and selling loser portfolios\nproduces higher than average returns. The evidence presented in this paper suggests\nthat the ASE does not fully incorporate publicly available accounting information into\nstock prices and hence violates the semi-strong efficient market hypothesis.\n11\nReferences\nAbarbanell A. and Bushee T.
