This review argues the need to \nattend to how knowledge and learning are conceived in development and how they \nare produced through organisations.  Drawing on mainstream development \nliterature, the review argues that there is a pervasive rationalist conception of \nknowledge and knowledge transfer as objective and universal, which has political \nimplications.  By contrast, the review argues for a post-rationalist approach that \nconceives development knowledge and learning as partial, social, produced \nthrough practices, and both spatially and materially relational.   \n \nKeywords  \n \nKnowledge, learning, rationalism, post-rationalism, World Bank, Slum \/ Shack \nDwellers International. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nThe relations between knowledge, learning and development are of growing \nimportance in development (see special issue of Development in Practice, 2002; \nDFID, 2000; Hovland, 2003; K. King, 2001; Wilson, 2002; World Bank, 1999). \nMainstream development institutions are increasingly arguing for the role of \nknowledge and learning in the development of \u201epoor\u201f countries.  The 1998\/9 \nWorld Bank World Development Report (WDR) entitled Knowledge for \nDevelopment, for example, argues that knowledge must be used to alleviate \npoverty and contribute to economic growth.  Numerous statements have been \nmade by the Bank claiming that \u201cKnowledge has become the most important \nfactor in economic development\u201d (World Bank, 2002: 7).  However, despite the \ngrowth of interest in this area since the mid-1990s, key issues have yet to be \nexplored.  Most of the recent literature is concerned with how organisations can \nand should manage knowledge (BOND 2002, 2003; Edwards, 1994), what \norganisations can do to enhance innovation and knowledge creation (DFID, 2000), \nhow organisations can become \u201elearning organisations\u201f (Hailey and James, 2002; \nRoper and Pettit, 2002), and how knowledge can be made more available to \npeople for development purposes (King, 2001)\n1\n.  The focus, then, has been on how \nknowledge is managed, created and shared.  While this review explores questions \nof knowledge creation and sharing, it does so with a critical perspective on the \nnature of knowledge and learning in development.  This includes attention to how \n                                                          \n1\n Often through Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) \u2013 see Chapman and Slaymaker \n(2002), Wilson (2002), and World Bank (1999). \n 4 \nknowledge and learning are conceived in development and how they are produced \nthrough organisations. \n \nLiterature on mainstream development\n2\n has tended to avoid a rigorous \nconsideration of knowledge and learning.  Even the large literature on \ntechnologies of participation, such as Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), often \nfails to consider how knowledge and learning are and should be conceptualised, \ndespite concerns with involving the knowledge of marginalised people in \ndevelopment policy and practices (Chambers, 1997; Holland and Blackburn, 1998; \nand see cautionary comments from Mohan, 2002, and Mosse, 1994; 2001).  I will \nargue that there is a need to closely consider knowledge, learning, and related \nconcepts because the ways in which they are conceived and practised plays a role \nin shaping development interventions and analysis.  The review will explore \nmainstream development scholarship and practice before considering examples \nfrom Slum \/ Shack Dwellers International (SDI), a transnational civil society \nnetwork working with urban development issues.  There are many ways to explore \nquestions of knowledge and learning in development, from detailed surveys of \nparticipatory technologies to considerations of postcolonial perspectives (see, for \ninstance, Briggs and Sharp, 2004, on conceiving indigenous knowledge).  There is \nnot the space in this review to explore these diverse literatures; instead, I hope to \nshow how a productive dialogue can take place around development literature and \norganisational theory.   \n \n                                                          \n2\n By \u201emainstream development\u201f I am referring to international development agencies, including \n(and not withstanding the differences between) multilaterals and bilaterals.   \n 5 \nThe review will begin with a discussion of how knowledge and learning are \nconceived in development policy and practice, arguing that there is a pervasive \nrationalist conception of knowledge as objective, universal and instrumental.  Any \ndiscussion of knowledge and learning in development cannot ignore the ways in \nwhich the movement of knowledge is conceived, and I will argue that knowledge \ntransfer is often conceived as a linear process whereby untransformed knowledge \nacts as a technical solution to a given development \u201eproblem\u201f.  I will then contrast \nthis approach to knowledge and learning by exploring the utility of, broadly cast, a \npost-rationalist perspective.  This is an approach that conceives knowledge and \nlearning as partial, social, produced through practices, and both spatially and \nmaterially relational.  In this reading, knowledge-in-travel is conceived as caught \nin translation, as always open to invention and change, and as multiple in form and \neffect.  I argue that work in organisational theory offers a range of post-rationalist \nperspectives that are useful for considering knowledge and learning in \ndevelopment, offering one productive means for advancing these debates in \ndevelopment studies.  I will use the SDI analysis as a means for illustrating the use \nof a post-rationalist approach to knowledge and learning in development. \n \nSDI is a network of nongovernmental (NGO) and community-based organisations \n(CBOs) working with urban poverty, spanning 12 countries throughout Asia and \nAfrica.  It is a learning network based around a structure of 'horizontal exchanges'.  \nThese exchanges involve small groups of the urban poor travelling from one urban \nsettlement to another to share knowledge in what amounts to an informal learning \nprocess.  With echoes of mainstream knowledge for development strategies, SDI \nleaders argue for the central importance of knowledge (of the urban poor) for \n 6 \ndevelopment.  SDI seek to place the knowledge and capacities of the poor at the \ncentre of development initiatives, and espouse a range of techniques that its \nleaders describe as indispensable to a development process driven by the \nknowledge of the urban poor.  These include a training programme of exchanges, \ndaily savings schemes, model house building, the enumeration of poor people's \nsettlements, and a variety of other tactics, some of which will be expanded on \nbelow.  SDI concurs with, for instance, the World Bank that knowledge is central \nto development.  However, SDI politicises knowledge for development by \ncontesting the ways in which knowledge is conceived, how it is created, how it is \ncommunicated, and how learning takes place.   \n \nI do not wish to suggest that SDI stands as a simple counter-point to the World \nBank, with the former always \u201epost-rationalist\u201f and the latter always \u201erationalist\u201f.  \nThe particular terrain of \u201erationalist\u201f and \u201epost-rationalist\u201f perspectives explored in \nthis review are not opposite, but different, and individuals at the World Bank and \nSDI are, of course, capable of simultaneously holding versions of both sets of \nperspectives.  There is no straightforward binary between \u201erationalist\u201f and \u201epost-\nrationalist\u201f.  On a similar register, the paper does not intend to romanticise SDI\u201fs \nwork \u2013 indeed, there are certainly critics of the politics of its knowledge initiatives \n(McFarlane, 2004).  My intention is to highlight a set of positions that actively \nwork against a view of development knowledge as an objective and universal \n\u201esolution\u201f that can be conceived unproblematically as separate from context and \npolitics, and to use SDI to illustrate some of these positions. \n \n 7 \nCreating and conceiving knowledge and learning \n \nConceptions of knowledge and learning are often taken-for-granted in accounts in \ndevelopment studies and mainstream development (Hovland 2003).  While there \nhas been some problematising of different types of knowledge, and of the \nrelationship between knowledge and information in development studies, there has \nbeen little attention to the ontological and epistemological basis of knowledge\n3\n.  \nThese questions are important because they contain assumptions that effect the \npolitics of development interventions and analyses.  Among mainstream \ndevelopment policy-makers, knowledge creation is often viewed as taking place in \na political vacuum (see Mehta, 2001 on the World Bank; Stone, 2003; Wilks, \n2001).   \n \nIn much mainstream development literature, knowledge is conceived as travelling \nbetween bounded territories.  This is premised on a double geography of two inter-\nrelated assumptions.  First, that information and knowledge travel in a linear way.  \nThis view of knowledge transfer is reminiscent of the functionalist resource-based \ntheory of the firm (Gherardi, 2000: 213) which claims that the transfer of \nknowledge may be accomplished without distortion: \u201cto transfer is not to \ntransform\u201d.  The second assumption supports this belief with a spatial ontology \ninformed by an imagination that information and knowledge circulate globally, \nand can be \u201eapplied to\u201f \u2013 with some alteration for local conditions \u2013 local places, \nor can work alongside \u201elocal\u201f knowledge.  From discussions of delivering \n                                                          \n3\n In this review, \u201eontology\u201f refers to understandings of what constitutes reality and \u201eepistemology\u201f \nrefers to understandings of what and how we know. \n 8 \n\u201einternational best practices\u201f to initiatives like the Global Development Network \n(Stone, 2003), knowledge is often conceived as a technical entity that can be \ndelivered unchanged as a development \u201esolution\u201f.  This move is an ontological \nseparation between space and place, an Euclidean imagination of the spatiality of \nglobalisation that separates information\/knowledge \u201eout there\u201f from that \u201ein here\u201f. \nThis vision perpetuates a North-South divide: \u201epoor\u201f countries are to draw on the \nknowledge of \u201erich\u201f countries in order to develop.  As the World Bank has argued: \n\u201cWith communication costs plummeting, transferring knowledge is cheaper than \never\u2026Given these advances, the stage appears to be set for a rapid narrowing of \nknowledge gaps and a surge in economic growth and well-being\u201d (World Bank, \n1999: 2).  Knowledge transfer is conceived as instrumental, reducing knowledge \nitself to a technology that can be applied, that is, a static entity that can be shifted \naround to do the job of development: \u201c[A] thing that can be produced or traded, \nexported or imported\u201d (Power, 2003: 186).  Below, I elaborate on this rationalist \ntendency before going on outline a broad post-rationalist approach to knowledge \nand learning, the latter of which will focus on translation as a key concept. \n \nRationalism \n \nThe traditional rationalist conception of knowledge has its resonances in \ncontemporary conceptions of knowledge formation as a linear process, whereby \nunstructured data is converted to structured information, before being added to a \nstock of knowledge that can inform wiser beliefs or judgements (Nonaka et al, \n2000; Amin and Cohendet, 2004: 18).  This idealist conception envisions \nknowledge as something that can be sent, received, circulated, transferred, \n 9 \naccumulated, converted and stored (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000).  In mainstream \ndevelopment, knowledge and learning are commonly viewed through a rational \nlens that frames learning as a cumulative process of \u201eadding\u201f new information to \nexisting knowledge \u201estacks\u201f in a straightforward way in order to make them more \neffective.  Often the assumption is that all development agencies, \nnongovernmental organisations, and think-tanks have to do is improve their \nknowledge management strategies, including knowledge capture and sharing. \n \nThe most relevant example in mainstream development is the World Bank\u201fs \n\u201eknowledge for development\u201f initiative launched in the mid-1990s.  The initiative \nis not an attempt to 'add-on' particular knowledge-sharing strategies to existing \ndevelopment initiatives.  It is, in the Bank's terms, an effort to 'mainstream' \nknowledge as a development tool (World Bank, 2003), and has even been referred \nto by one senior staff member as a \"shift in development paradigm\" (Laporte, \n2004).  It is an attempt to reimagine development as knowledge and to encourage \nstaff to think of themselves as 'knowledge brokers'.  This means, for example, that \nBank Country Assessment Strategies (CASs) should be written with a central \nfocus on identifying \u201eknowledge gaps\u201f, detailing ways of delivering the right kinds \nof development knowledge, and building the institutional capacities of public, \nprivate and civil society organisations to get to the right kinds of knowledge and \nmanage it effectively.   \n \nThe World Bank perceives knowledge as a critical ingredient lacking in poor \ncountries.  The 1998-9 Knowledge for Development World Development Report \nclaims (1999: 1): \u201cPoor countries - and poor people - differ from rich ones not \n 10 \nonly because they have less capital but because they have less knowledge.  \nKnowledge is often costly to create, and that is why much of it is created in \nindustrial countries\u201d.  For the Bank, it is knowledge and not resources that \u201chas \nbecome perhaps the most important factor determining the standard of living \u2013 \nmore so than land, than tools, than labor\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 16, cited in Power, \n2003: 185).  In the Bank\u201fs view, countries that fail to encourage knowledge for \ndevelopment strategies \u201care likely to fall behind those that succeed in encouraging \nit\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 186, cited in Power, 2003: 186).  From the outset, then, the \nBank\u201fs spatial ontology of \u201eknowledge for development\u201f makes a political move, \ndespite the presentation of the initiative as a technical solution to a development \nproblem (a \u201eknowledge gap\u201f).  Not only is there the problematic claim that \n\u201eknowledge\u201f is the most important feature in development, it is also assumed that \nknowledge must originate in the \u201eNorth\u201f.  While there are no doubt individuals \nwithin the Bank who recognise flaws and limitations in this rationalist rubric, in \npractice the Bank\u201fs official position in its \u201eknowledge for development\u201f \ndocumentation and initiatives has a significant influence internationally in framing \nhow development \u201eproblems\u201f are constituted and how the \u201esolutions\u201f take shape \n(see, for instance, Mawdsley and Rigg, 2003, on the WDRs).    \n \nThere is little attempt to define knowledge.  The Knowledge for Development \nWDR instead makes a distinction between \u201eknowledge about technology\u201f and \n\u201eknowledge about attributes\u201f.  Knowledge about technology refers to \u201ctechnical \nknow-how\u201d around \u201cnutrition, birth control, software engineering, and \naccountancy\u201d, and \u201cknowledge about attributes\u201d refers to the \u201cquality of a product, \nthe diligence of a worker, or the creditworthiness of a firm \u2013 all crucial to effective \n 11 \nmarkets\u201d (1999: 1).  Incomplete knowledge about attributes results in market \nfailure and problems for the poor.  Knowledge is conceived as \u201clight\u201d capable of \n\u201cenlightening\u201d the \u201cdarkness of poverty\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 1).  As the \n\u201eKnowledge Bank\u201f (Stiglitz, 1998; World Bank, 1999), Mehta (1999: 154) \nsuggests, the Bank attributes to itself \u201ca major role in dispelling this darkness of \nignorance\u201d (see World Bank, 1999: 6-7).  As Power (2003: 72-77) points out, \nthere are obvious legacies here with Enlightenment ideals and modernist thought \u2013 \nof \u201elearned\u201f moderns guiding the progress of distant others, of knowledge as a \ntechnology rooted in reason and rationality.  The ordering of knowledge along a \nNorth-South divide not only risks marginalising alternative voices, then, it risks \n\u201ctypecasting and recreating images of the poor as ignorant or depraved, in urgent \nneed of knowledge and enlightenment\u201d (Mehta, 1999: 154). \n \n\u201eKnowledge about technology\u201f and \u201eknowledge about attributes\u201f represent \nknowledge \u201egaps\u201f between the North and the South, and the Bank highlights ways \nof reducing these gaps.  Rather than \u201cre-creating existing knowledge\u201d (World \nBank, 1999: 2), poor countries are encouraged to acquire knowledge from the \nNorth through open trade regimes and foreign investment, as well as to build on \nindigenous knowledge.  Countries should \u201cacquire, absorb and communicate \nknowledge\u201d by expanding their research base and developing secondary \neducation, particularly in science and engineering (World Bank, 1999: 2).  The \nWDR argues that while orthodox development models assume perfect \ninformation, poor countries suffer more from imperfect information than rich \ncountries.  As imperfect information deleteriously affects institutions and their \nstructures, environmental policies, and the broader economy, international \n 12 \ninstitutions and states have a duty to help bridge knowledge gaps.  A central \nfeature of the Bank\u201fs rationalism is the conception of knowledge as \u201estacks\u201f that \ncan be shifted North to South to create near-perfect information.  The Bank and \nthe North are framed as \u201esenders\u201f; the South as \u201ereceivers\u201f (Power, 2003: 186), \nand the process of travel is incidental and direct, as occurring without \ndeformation.  Knowledge is conceived as universally applicable; wherever it goes \nit can have similar effects.  There is an assumption in the WDR that \u201cknowledge \ncan easily be decontextualised from its original source\u201d (Mehta, 1999: 154).  In \nthe WDR, \u201eknowledge for development\u201f, Mehta (1999: 154) contends, is defined \nas separate from the \u201csocio-political world within which it is located\u201d.  The WDR \nposits knowledge as a \u201ecommodity\u201f without geography. \n \nThe view of knowledge as a commodity is underpinned by the Bank\u201fs conception \nof knowledge and knowledge transfer as a technical process.  In the Bank\u201fs \nknowledge initiatives, knowledge is generally conceived of as technical: \u201c[T]he \nexamples highlighted [in the WDR] largely concern technical know-how, software \ntechnology, information technology\u201d (Mehta, 1999: 156).  The key means for \nknowledge transfer are, correspondingly, Information Communication \nTechnologies (ICTs).  ICTs are viewed as both essential means to create \nknowledge \u2013 \u201ceven greater than the knowledge gap is the gap in the capacity to \ncreate knowledge\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 2, cited in Power, 2003: 186) - and \ntechnologies the poor need to know how to use in order to gain information to \nbetter develop.  \u201eCommunicating knowledge\u201f in the Bank\u201fs espousal of knowledge \nfor development refers specifically to what the Bank perceives as opportunities for \n\u201cvast amounts of information\u201d to travel in seconds at an \u201cever-decreasing cost\u201d \n 13 \nthrough the \u201cconvergence of computing and telecommunications\u201d (World Bank, \n1999: 9).  Technologies such as mobile telephones and the internet allow for a \ngreater acquisition and absorption of knowledge, argues the WDR.  The WDR, as \nMehta (1999: 156) points out, cites examples such as email being used by small \nbusiness enterprises in Vietnam, and Panamanian women who post pictures of \ntheir handicraft on their websites. \n \nICTs are viewed as a key part of the Bank\u201fs three main global knowledge \ninitiatives: the Development Gateway, the Global Development and Learning \nNetwork, and the Global Development Network, internet-based networks which \ncost the Bank $60 million between 1997 and 2002 (World Bank, 2003).  The \nDevelopment Gateway, launched in 1999, is an internet portal that gives access to \nstudies, information and trends, allows for groups and individuals to exchange \nideas, and enables collaboration.  It is aimed at governments, private \norganisations, civil society groups, and donors, and through it the Bank has \nsupported the launch of 44 country-based gateways.  In July 2002, the Bank \nestimated that the Gateway provided information on 300,000 donor supported \nactivities world-wide (World Bank, 2002).  The Gateway aims to use ICTs to \n\u201cincrease knowledge sharing; enable aid effectiveness; improve public sector \ntransparency; and build local capacity to empower communities\u201d (Development \nGateway, 2003).  However, while internet use is in rapid increase in many 'poorer' \ncountries, it remains sporadic and unreliable.  When less than 30% of visitors to \nthe site come from outside the United States (World Bank, 2003), there is a need \nto question how effective the Gateway is in meeting the Bank's objective of \n'sharing knowledge' with 'poorer' countries and communities.    \n 14 \n \nThe Bank argues that inequities in internet access illustrate the need to make such \ntechnologies more widely available, and that the rate at which internet use is \nspreading indicates that many countries will be able to participate in ICT-based \nknowledge strategies in the near future.  However, even if that were the case - and \nas Mehta (1999: 156) argues there is no guarantee that many people in rural \nAfrica, for instance, will get access to the internet in the foreseeable future - the \ninternet is likely to remain secondary to the needs of the poor when compared with \n\u201ctenure rights, food security, water security and their access to institutions and \ncredit\u201d, even if it is a vehicle to a greater variety of information about these same \nissues.  Others have commented that an ICT focus often entails a \"neglect of local \ninitiative in the design of development efforts and a threat of the erosion of \nindigenous and informal systems due to the influence of formal, ICT-based, \nwestern-oriented information systems\" (Madon, 2000: 11).  Moreover, the content \nof networks like the Gateway is far from politically neutral, despite Bank \npretensions.  Content is contributed by some 130 organisations and a group of \ncontent editors within and outside the Bank manage different topic areas (World \nBank, 2003: 25).  Although the Bank's responsibility for the Gateway was passed \nto a non-profit independent governing body - the Development Gateway \nFoundation - in 2001, the Bank's role in the Gateway has been a source of \ncriticism.      \n \nWilks (2001) has argued that the Bank's 'Tower of Babel' on the internet risks \npresenting 'success stories' as possible solutions to development problems, or \ndetermining what constitutes a development problem.  A World Bank evaluation \n 15 \nof the Gateway has noted that a number of groups and academics object to what \nthey view as an effective \"filtering\" of knowledge by the Bank, and has called on \nthe Bank to be more \"inclusive\" of perspectives beyond those that are narrowly \npro-market (World Bank, 2003: 25-26).  In addition to being a major financial \ncontributor to the Gateway, the Bank controls decisions over who becomes \nPresident, Treasurer, and has three seats of an 18 member board - all of which has \n\"fuelled criticisms of undue influence\" (ibid: 26).  In sum, the rationalist approach \nto knowledge and knowledge transfer evidenced in Bank literatures conceives of \nknowledge as objective and universal, as a technical entity that can be moved in a \nlinear way unchanged from place to place, and in so doing separates the \nconception of knowledge from politics and context.    \n \nPost-rationalism \n \nWhile there is a wide-ranging literature criticising the rationalist approach to \nknowledge in development, most notably in post-development and anthropological \nscholarship (see, for example, Escobar, 1995; Ferguson, 1994; Hobart, 1993; \nMoore, 1996), this literature often stops short of developing alternative ways of \nconceiving knowledge and learning.  In this review, I attempt this by exploring \nliterature emphasising the social and constructive character of knowing and \nlearning.  In the field of organisational learning, for instance, some have referred \nto a \u201equiet revolution\u201f in organisational theory (Bruner and Haste, 1987, cited in \nGherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 330).  These alternatives propose that knowledge has \nthe following characteristics (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000): it is situated in \nsystems of ongoing practices; it is relational and mediated by artifacts; it is always \n 16 \nrooted in a context of interaction and acquired through some form of participation \nin a community of practice; and it is continually reproduced and negotiated, hence \nalways dynamic and provisional. \n \nFor Gherardi and Nicolini (2000: 332), this approach to knowledge prompts new \nquestions - or new approaches to old and often taken-for-granted questions - \nwhich both echo the concerns of this review and indicate the relevancy of \nliterature on organisational theory to debates about knowledge and learning in \ndevelopment: How do different forms of knowledge \u201etravel\u201f in space and time? \nHow is knowledge transformed by the process of its circulation?  What form does \nthis circulation take? Who are the agents who circulate knowledge and appropriate \nit?  How are local practices shaped by the interaction between situated knowledge \nand formalized knowledge?  How is knowing constructed and sustained in \npractice?  My argument is that one effective route into these and other questions is \nto conceive knowledge and learning as produced through translation.   \n \nThis review builds on work that offers alternatives to a rationalist approach that \nwe might broadly refer to as post-rationalist.  \u201ePost\u201f does not refer to a specific \nperiod of time but to perspectives critical of rationalist approaches over time.  My \nintention here is not to suggest that there is a simple binary between \u201erationalism\u201f \nand \u201epost-rationalism\u201f.  There are overlaps between the two different sets of \npositions that I explore in this review, and it is, of course, possible to hold views \nthat are both \u201erationalist\u201f and otherwise.  What I want to do is highlight a set of \npositions that actively work against a view of development knowledge as an \nobjective and universal \u201esolution\u201f that can be conceived unproblematically as \n 17 \nseparate from context and politics.  Here, \u201epost-rationalist\u201f emphasises the socio-\nmaterial construction of knowledge, the spatial relationality of knowledge, and the \nimportance of practices.   \n \nTranslation comes originally from the work of Michel Serres (1974) and \u201cinvolves \ncreating convergences and homologies by relating things that were previously \ndifferent\u201d (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 333).  Latour uses translation to refer not \nto \u201ca shift from one vocabulary to another, from one French word to one English \nword, for instance\u201d, but \u201cto mean displacement, drift, invention, mediation, the \ncreation of a link that did not exist before and that to some degree modifies the \noriginal two\u201d (1999: 179).  A \u201cchain of translation\u201d refers to the many steps \nthrough which knowledge is produced (Latour, 1999: 311).  The process of \ntranslation changes to varying extents not just the forms of knowledge but the \npeople and places that come into relation with knowledge.  Rather than focussing \nsimply on the question of whether knowledge remains the same or not, it focuses \nattention on the multiple forms and effects of knowledge.   \n \nTranslation challenges the diffusion model (of epidemiological origin) that traces \nmovement as innovation\n4\n (Alter, 2002; Brown, 2002; Latour, 1986).  While the \ndiffusion model focuses on travel as the product of the action of an authoritative \ncentre transmitting knowledge, translation focuses on travel as the product of what \ndifferent actors do with objects (statements, orders, artefacts, products, goods, \n                                                          \n4\n See, for example, Hagerstand\u201fs (1968) influential formal and instrumental model of innovation \ndiffusion (Agnew, 1979). \n \n 18 \netc.) (Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 335).  This draws attention to the importance \nof various forms of \u201eintermediaries\u201f, and promotes two relational ontologies: one, \nthe importance of relationships between the \u201enear\u201f and \u201efar\u201f in producing \nknowledge; two, the importance of materials in producing knowledge (Amin and \nCohendet, 2004).  Translation is open to the possibility of varying degrees of \nstability and flux: it is not the case that every encounter must always involve \nchange, nor is it the case that every encounter must always involve the recreation \nof a periphery in the image of a centre.  Taking translation as a central concept, the \nnext section will clarify where a post-rationalist approach to knowledge and \nlearning in development leaves concepts like information, knowledge and \nlearning.  This will then pave the way for a discussion of learning in development, \nfocussing on the World Bank and SDI.   I outline a broadly cast post-rationalist \nperspective to knowledge and learning that insists from the start that knowledge is \nsituated, socio-material, formed through practices, and often political.  I use SDI\u201fs \nlearning initiatives as an example because this network marks a generally distinct \nconception of knowledge and learning that offers an often different set of learning \npractices from those of the World Bank. \n \nInformation, knowledge and learning: the role of translation \n \nWhile there is significant and necessary overlap between concepts like \ninformation, knowledge and learning, elucidation is important because they point \nto different processes.  I will draw mainly but not exclusively on literature \nexploring situated knowledges and social learning in organisations as well as \nrecent development literature and practice. \n 19 \n \nInformation and knowledge \n \nIn the 1999 World Development Report, \u201eknowledge\u201f and \u201einformation\u201f are often \nused interchangeably.  \u201cIncomplete knowledge\u201d is posed as an \u201cinformation \nproblem\u201d (World Bank, 1999: 1).  Ostensibly, information is distinguished from \nknowledge in terms of \u201eknowledge gaps\u201f and \u201einformation problems\u201f.  A \nknowledge gap is the unequal distribution of \u201eknow-how\u201f, about, for instance, \nnutrition or software, within and between countries.  An information problem is \nincomplete knowledge of attributes - for instance, the quality of a product or \ncreditworthiness of a firm (World Bank, 1999).  Knowledge gaps and information \nproblems blur into one another (Power, 2003: 186).  There is little reflection on \nhow information is converted into knowledge or vice-versa, or how learning \noccurs in practice.  Key questions go unexamined.  What happens when \ninformation becomes knowledge?  How does information get used?  How does \nlearning occur?   \n \nSome rudimentary insights begin to problematise the Bank\u201fs rationalist approach \nto information and knowledge.  Information refers to data or facts that can be \nreadily communicated.  Knowledge can be distinguished from information as \u201cthe \nsense that people make of information\u201d (Hovland, 2003: 20).  Information is \ninterpreted in multiple ways and has multiple effects.  Given that the places \ninformation moves through are generally different, it is likely that the knowledge \nthat results and what it does will be to some extent different.  For instance, Power \n(2003: 187) asks: \u201cHow is the same information viewed differently by, say, a \n 20 \ngovernment official as opposed to a community activist?\u201d  Mehta (1999: 151; see \nalso 2001) argues that the Bank\u201fs conception \u201coperates with a very narrow and \nreductionist notion of knowledge which ignores the dynamic and plural aspects \nshaping knowledge production and generation\u201d.  \n \nA post-rationalist approach to the conversion of information to knowledge begins \nfrom three starting points: that knowledge is formed through interaction, that \nknowledge is situated, and that knowledge has two broad forms \u2013 tacit and \ncodified (or explicit).  First, knowledge is socially produced.  Various forms of \ninteraction amongst individuals and organisations, from formal meetings to chats \nover coffee and through emails, contribute to making sense of information.  For \nSDI, for example, knowledge is a product of social, cultural, economic and \npolitical conditions.  Knowledge is conceived as embedded in the lives and \nexperiences of the poor themselves.  For instance, knowledge about potential \nhousing in the construction of model houses is conceived as emerging from \npeople\u201fs shared experiences of constructing, reconstructing and adapting informal \nshacks (Patel and Mitlin, 2001: 18; 2002).  Second, knowledge is situated.  For \nNonaka et al (2000: 7), this means knowledge is context-specific.  It is always \ndependent on particular times and spaces.  It is, then, associated with identity and \nbelief: \u201cInformation becomes knowledge when it is interpreted by individuals and \ngiven a context and anchored in the beliefs and commitments of individuals\u201d \n(Nonaka et al, 2000: 7).  That development knowledges are imbued with values \nand context is, of course, part of the reason they are so frequently politicised.  If \nknowledge is \u201ejustified belief\u201f (Nonaka, et al 2000: 7), then particular \ndevelopment discourses are ways of thinking and doing that provide that \n 21 \njustification.  Discourses legislate what kind of knowledge and information is \nvaluable.  We can talk of knowledge as \u201ejustified belief\u201f because of the regulation \nof information and knowledge through enrolment into particular ways of seeing \nand doing, or regimes of truth.  Regimes of truth have the effects of framing \n\u201eproblems\u201f, which involves defining what are problems and what are not.  \nDevelopment issues are constructed, regulated and interpreted through discourses \n(Escobar, 1995; Ferguson, 1994), from those on \u201egood governance\u201f (Masujima, \n2004) to those on \u201eself-help\u201f.  Given that discourses render knowledge, events and \ninstitutions in a particular way, they militate against alterity to some extent.  \nDiscourses hold stability and flux in a constant tension, which can create a \nparadox for those committed to learning initiatives in development.  For example, \nthere is a discourse in SDI emphasising poor people\u201fs knowledge, whereby poor \npeople\u201fs knowledge is framed as a more valuable form of development knowledge \nthan other forms. \n \nThe situatedness of knowledge draws attention to the spatialities of knowledge: \nknowledge is always situated and because of this partiality it is always multiple.  It \nis also territorialized through various forms of inclusion and exclusion, meaning \nthat it can be to varying intensities in or out of the \u201eproper\u201f spaces (Law, 2000).  \nThe notion of \u201esituated knowledge\u201f has been developed most notably by Haraway \n(1991).  She underlined partiality by focusing on the embodied nature and \ncontingencies of knowledge production.  Thrift (1998: 303) writes of the need for \nan irreducible ontology that thinks not of \u201eKnowledge\u201f but of \u201can archipelago of \nsituated knowledges\u201d.  While situated, this knowledge is also mobile: it is formed \nnot simply in place but through multiple knowledges and informations that run \n 22 \nthrough various spaces and pathways.  For example, discourses of \u201esocial capital\u201f \nmay be framed by the World Bank (Harriss, 2002; Fine, 2000; McNeill, 2004), but \nthe ways in which social capital is conceived and practised \u201eon the ground\u201f is not \nsimply the product of the Bank as an authoritative centre.  Rather, it is a relation \nbetween Bank discourses, local agencies, local circumstances and priorities, and \nso on.  \n \nThird, knowledge is of two broad forms: tacit and codified.  Codified or explicit \nknowledge \u201ccan be expressed in formal and systemic language and shared in the \nform of data, scientific formulae, specifications, manuals and such like\u201d, (Nonaka \net al, 2000: 7).  This includes development statistics, reports, and \nrecommendations in the form of, for example, \u201einternational best practices\u201f \n(Tomlinson, 2002).  Tacit knowledge \u201cis deeply rooted in action, procedures, \nroutines, commitment, ideals, values and emotions\u201d: it is difficult to communicate \nand does not travel well (Nonaka et al, 2000: 7).  Just as information can be \nconverted into knowledge, so tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit \nknowledge, \u201calthough [tacit] knowledge sometimes resists\u201d (Gherardi, 2000: 213) \nand becomes \u201csticky\u201d (von Hippel, 1994).  Knowledge is primarily tacit, as often \n\u201eunknown\u201f and pre-cognitive competence-to-act.  Both forms are complementary \nand essential in knowledge creation (Nonaka et al, 2000: 8; Amin and Cohendet, \n1999, 2000, 2004).  However, the tacit-codified distinction, while useful, does not \nexhaust the range of knowledges that play a role in the constitution, operations and \nimpacts of development.  It tends to ignore, for instance, symbolic and expressive \nknowledge (Allen, 2002).  A different set of development knowledges, those \nbased on senses, emotions, and feelings, play a role in the formation and \n 23 \ncommunication of knowledge (see Allen, 2002, writing about economic \nknowledges).  For example, in SDI, solidarity plays a role in the formation and \nmovement of knowledge, and in what particular forms of knowledge come to \nrepresent.   \n \nKnowledge as practice \n \nGherardi (2000: 212) argues that \u201camong the manifold conversations [from \nMarxist inspired perspectives to actor network theory] now in progress on the \ntheme of knowing and organizing, there is one that has an emergent identity \ncentering on the idea of practice\u201d.  The attention to practice collapses traditional \ndichotomies that separate, for example, knowing from acting, mental from \nmanual, and abstract from concrete, that continue to contour ontologies of \nknowledge (Wenger, 1998: 48).   \n \nPractice connects \u201eknowledge\u201f with \u201edoing\u201f, pointing to the work, or fabrication, \ninvolved in knowing (Gherardi, 2000).  If we reject the functionalist view of \nknowledge as static, bounded and fixed, and argue instead for a view of \nknowledge as social, then the practices through which knowledge is formed are \nbrought into view.  This fabrication is not \u201esocial\u201f in the sense of just consisting of \npeople, but always already social and material.  Knowledge production is a \nprocess of heterogeneous engineering (Law and Hassard, 1999; Thrift, 2000) and \nrequires an ontological relational materialism.  A whole range of materials, from \ndocuments to infrastructures, make a difference in the production and movement \nof development knowledge.   \n 24 \n \nA focus on practice facilitates the bringing together of ostensibly different modes \nof knowledge production.  One example here is the attempt by Nonaka et al (2000: \n6-7) to bring the ontological and epistemological dimensions together in a \u201espiral \nmodel\u201f of knowledge creation which insists that the process is dialectic.  The \nspiral goes through seemingly antithetical concepts such as order and chaos, micro \nand macro, part and whole, mind and body, tacit and explicit, self and other, \ndeduction and induction, creativity and control, body and mind, emotion and logic, \nand action and cognition.  Attention to the practices of knowledge production \nhelps brings together these disparate notions, and involves collapsing modernist \nontological and epistemological divisions of knowledge.   \n \nFor SDI, knowledge is based on practice (Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, \n2000: 4).  \u201ePractice\u201f in SDI refers both to participation in regular activities, such as \ndaily savings, and participation in less regular activities, such as house modelling \nand enumerations, that create knowledge.  The emphasis on experience and \npractice positions knowledge as produced through the everyday interactions \nbetween people and objects (housing materials, documents, maps, savings books, \nand so on), and stands in contrast to the disembedded and abstracted \nconceptualisation of knowledge deployed by the World Bank.  The next section \nwill explore the notion of learning through participation in practice more fully.  A \ndiscussion of learning as it is conceived in the Bank and SDI then follows. \n \nLearning as participation in practices \n \n 25 \nLearning at the organisational level is often portrayed using three feedback loops \nknown as single-, double- and triple-loop learning.  Wilson (2002: 220), writing in \nreference to mainstream development, elaborates:  \n \nIn single-loop learning, only the practical tasks might be modified in light of knowledge capture.  \nIn double-loop learning the definition of what the practical tasks should be is challenged.  In triple-\nloop learning, the knowledge captured is used to improve the effectiveness of how it might be \ncaptured in future, via the evaluation of the appraisal process.  This last is often referred to as \n\u201elearning how to learn\u201f. \n \nWhile providing a useful overview, we might question the extent to which such \ninstrumental accounts are able to adequately appreciate learning as situated and \nsocial, despite references to knowledge as \u201einterpreted through culture\u201f.  Wenger \n(1998: 4), in his influential study of firms, Communities of Practice, focuses on \nlearning as social participation: \u201c[A] process of being active participants in the \npractices of social communities and constituting identities in relation to these \ncommunities\u201d.  For Wenger (1998), \u201eknowing\u201f is the ability to competently \nparticipate in the practices of a community.  Learning as a practice has two aspects \nfor Wenger: experience and regimes of competence.  New experiences can lead to \nnew competences and vice-versa.  Group members have to \u201ecatch-up\u201f to get to \ngrips with new skills introduced by new members (competences driving \nexperience), and changing events may require the development of new skills \n(experience driving competences).  This view defines learning not as a linear \naddition of information or knowledge but as a \u201ctransformation of knowing\u201d (1998: \n139): learning \u201ccan be characterized as a change in the alignment between \n 26 \nexperience and competence, whichever one of the two takes the lead in causing \nrealignment at any given moment\u201d.  \n \nFor Lave and Wenger (1991) and Wenger (1998, 2000) learning involves \nstrengthening the practices of communities and the abilities of individuals to \nparticipate in those practices.  Contu and Willmott (2000: 274) point to this focus \nas an important shift from the question \u201ewhat knowledge is objectively true?\u201f to \n\u201ewhat understanding is intersubjectively valuable?\u201f  This brings into view the \nsituatedness of particular kinds of knowledge and learning, and the ways in which \nthe privileging of particular types of knowledge and learning is inflected by and \nproduces certain types of politics.  Participation in practices, then, is important in \nlearning, and this process is mutually constitutive with the formation of social \ncollectives. \n \nLearning is influenced through the formation of a constellation of communities of \npractice (Wenger, 1998: 127).  Using translation, Amin and Cohendet (2004) have \ndescribed this process as a distanciated sociology of learning which asserts that \nrelational or social proximity involves more than simply physically \u201ebeing there\u201f, \nand that indeed there are increasingly new ways of \u201ebeing there\u201f (including \nthrough email or videoconferencing).  For example, Allen (2000: 28) has written: \n \nThe translation of ideas and practices, as opposed to their transmission, are likely to involve people \nmoving to and through \u201elocal\u201f contexts, to which they bring their own blend of tacit and codified \nknowledges, ways of doing and ways of judging things.  There is no one spatial template through \nwhich associational understanding or active comprehension takes place.  Rather, knowledge \n 27 \ntranslation involves mobile, distanciated forms of information as much as it does proximate \nrelationships. \n \nRather than a single spatial template, what emerges is a \u201ccomplex spatial ecology\u201d \nthat is alert to \u201cthe near and far, the possessed and practised, the role of \ncompetences and communities\u201d (Amin and Cohendet, 2004: 110, 111).  More \nbroadly, and following (Urry, 2004), we need to be attentive to a whole range of \nmobilities in knowledge creation, including those that produce \u201eface-to-face\u201f \ninteraction \u2013 that most potent and powerful medium of communication \u2013 and other \ninter-related modes of communication including mail, phone calls, faxes, and the \ninternet.  For the urban poor, the spatial extent of these different modes of \ncommunication, while varied, is highly restricted.  Membership of SDI, of \nconstellations of communities of practice, offers possibilities for stretching and \nrefiguring these spatialities, and for subverting in small ways the dominance of \ndomains of national and transnational learning by development consultants.  The \nimage of an open constellation of learning, however, is restricted by a rationalising \nof the kinds of learning that are privileged.   \n \nAll of the processes discussed under the particular umbrella of post-rationalism \noutlined in this section are driven by translation.  Information is converted to \nknowledge though translation, as is knowledge to learning, and the discursive \nframing of development \u201eproblems\u201f and \u201esolutions\u201f is a continual process of \ntranslation.  The inclusions and exclusions of knowledge throw the politics of \nlearning into sharp relief, as the example of how learning often occurs in World \nBank projects reveals.  In the next section, I will explore these projects and \n 28 \ncontrast them with SDI\u201fs commitment to \u201elearning-by-doing\u201f, drawing on \nexamples from exchanges, daily savings, and model house and toilet construction. \n \nThe \u2018learning organisation\u2019?   \n \nIn World Bank discourses, learning is assumed to be incidental \u2013 an inevitable by-\nproduct of knowledge transmission.  It is a view of learning \u201cin terms of the \ntransmission, circulation and appropriation of information and knowledge\u201d \n(Gherardi and Nicolini, 2000: 329).  Furthermore, the kinds of knowledge that can \ncontribute to learning about development are limited by an adherence in \ninstitutions like the World Bank to \u201eOfficial Views\u201f.  For David Ellerman (2002: \n286), Economic Advisor to the Chief Economist at the Bank, the Bank is a \n\u201cdevelopment Church\u201d in which \u201cnew learning at the expense of established \nOfficial Views is not encouraged\u201d.  Writing about \u201cbranded knowledge as \ndogma\u201d, Ellerman (ibid) argues: \n \nThe Church or party model fits perfectly with the standard \u201edissemination\u201f or transmission-belt \nmethodology of knowledge-based development assistance.  The agency believes it holds the best \n\u201eknowledge for development\u201f and is to transmit it to the recipients in the developing world through \nvarious forms of aid-baited proselytisation. \n \nCoyle (2001), in her study of the World Bank and the IMF, has similarly found \nthat that multilaterals have a need to project an image of having the right answers \nand maintaining a consensual official line.  The Church or party model that \nEllerman describes reflects the particular ways in which the Bank frames \ndevelopment \u201eproblems\u201f and \u201esolutions\u201f.  Attention to how development \n 29 \n\u201eproblems\u201f and \u201esolutions\u201f are framed perhaps most starkly reveals the politics of \ntranslation, and underlines that the Bank\u201fs rationalist conception of knowledge and \nlearning amounts to an attempt to remove politics from knowledge.  Stone (2003) \ndraws attention to how a broad post-Washington discursive consensus, advocating \nopen trade regimes and various forms of pro-capitalist growth strategies to reduce \npoverty, frames the kinds of knowledge and information that should be used and \npromoted in the Global Development Network (GDN) because it acts as a regime \nof truth.  For example, the GDN often highlights pro-market development \nexamples and its 2003 Global Development Awards were given to research and \npolicies that were pro-market (Global Development Network, 2003).  Not only \ndoes this entail the exclusion of alternative knowledges and positions, it also \nentails the privileging of particular forms of indigenous knowledge that are \ndeemed marketable.  For instance, writing about Indian handicrafts and African \nmusic, Finger and Schuler (2004: 3), of the American Enterprise Institute and the \nWorld Bank respectively, suggest that indigenous knowledges that are deemed not \ncommercially viable should not be valued on the same level as those that are.  On \na different but related register, Mehta (1999) argues that the Bank\u201fs espousal of an \nundifferentiated and unchanging knowledge is false and potentially dangerous.  \nShe argues that the Bank needs to \u201crecognise the multiple and differentiated \n[gender, class, caste, etc] forms of knowledge and knowing and the socio-political \ncontexts within which they are located, constantly contested and re-created\u201d \n(Mehta, 1999: 160).  \n \nThe tendency to \u201eapply\u201f development solutions is bound up with the timescale of \nmainstream development projects, which puts pressure on strategies to be \n 30 \ncompleted in a hurried cycle of two or three years (Mawdsley, et al, 2002).  \nEllerman warns against the \u201cself-reinforcing lock-in between development \nagencies and their client countries\u201d (2002: 289), whereby learning about problems \nis prevented by advice and help from a powerful outsider and an eagerness by \nlocal policy-makers to jump to a ready-made solution.  This \u201crage to conclude\u201d \n(Ellerman, 2002: 289) often leads to an espousal of best practices \u2013 \u201ca tendency \nbased not on any methods resembling social science but on a bureaucratic need to \nmaintain elite prestige by \u201ehaving an answer\u201f for the client\u201d (Ellerman, 2002: \n289).   \n \nMoving towards a \u201elearning organisation\u201f (Ellerman, 2002: 291) requires a \nrecasting of international development agencies like the World Bank away from \nan adherence to set views and a \u201cpaternalistic model of \u201eteaching\u201f\u201d, towards a \n\u201etwo-way\u201f learning process: \u201cIf the development agency can move beyond the \nChurch or party model to an open learning model, then it can also move from \nstandard knowledge dissemination or transmission-belt methodology towards \nknowledge-based capacity building\u201d.  Ellerman echoes Freire (1970) in casting \nlearning as a way of creating pedagogical and social transformations, rather than \nan attempt to create linear knowledge additions.  This is rooted in a Socratic \nlearning tradition of intellectual duelling in which development is an ongoing \nmutual engagement rather than preconceived and predetermined.  Such an \nengagement, however, must counter the unequal power relations that contour \nBank-client relations.   \n \n 31 \nIn contrast to the Bank\u201fs official position, SDI argues that knowledge necessarily \nchanges as it moves.  There is frequent comment by SDI leaders that knowledge \ncannot be disseminated in a linear and instrumental way, but that it always \nchanges\n5\n.  Knowledge and social conditions are perceived as changing through the \ninteraction of different groups from different countries.  The Asian Coalition for \nHousing Rights (ACHR), an SDI partner, (2000: 14) have commented on the \nmutually transforming relationship between knowledge and place: \u201cThings which \nmight start out looking alike \u2013 negotiating strategies, house designs, credit \nmanagement systems, land-sharing models, community contracts \u2013 always get \nchanged, adapted when they move around\u201d.   Writing about horizontal exchanges, \nACHR (2000: 14) assert that knowledge must change in travel: \u201c[E]xchange is not \na means for transferring specific solutions \u2013 solutions have to specific to \nconditions in a given place\u2026[exchange involves] tools [for example, enumeration, \nexhibition, daily savings] for finding solutions\u201d.  The discourse of \u201ebest practice\u201f \nthat circulates mainstream development is treated with caution.  ACHR (2000: 10) \ninstead argue that the travelling of knowledge is \u201emessier\u201f because it becomes \ncaught up with the particularities of place: \u201cPeer learning through exchange is \nabout as far removed from this best practice thinking as you can get.  It\u201fs perhaps \na bit messier, a bit less photogenic.\u201d  Similarly, the Patel, Burra and D\u201fCruz \n(2001: 51), members of the Indian chapter of the network, argue that SDI\u201fs \nactivities are not about \u201cprojects and \u201ebest practices\u201f\u201d but about \u201cprocesses and \nevolving strategies\u201d that extend far beyond the standardised three-year project \ncycle, and that prioritise local circumstances and struggles. \n                                                          \n5\n See SDI (2003), ACHR (2000), Patel and Mitlin (2001), Homeless International (2001), special \nissue of Environment and Urbanization (2001). \n 32 \n \nThe most frequent way in which learning is referred to in SDI is in terms of \n\u201elearning-by-doing\u201f in groups (Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, 2000; SDI, \n2003; Patel and Mitlin, 2001).  Learning is conceived as taking place \u201cin situ\u201d \n(Homeless International, 2000: 7).  Learning occurs through an \u201cimmediate \nimmersion in the ongoing projects of the host community\u201d (Appadurai, 2002: 41).  \nThis immersion can be any of a whole range of activities, such as an enumeration, \nexhibition, or dialogue with local state officials.  For instance, Appadurai (2002: \n41) states that exchange activities \u201crange from scavenging in the Philippines and \nsewer digging in Pakistan to women\u201fs savings activities in South Africa and \nhousing exhibitions in India\u201d.   \n \nLearning-by-doing is an explicitly social affair in SDI: learning occurs through \ninteraction with people and participating in the practices of a group.  Wenger \n(1998: 45) defines communities of practice (COP) as \u201ccreated over time by the \nsustained pursuit of a shared enterprise\u201d.  Knowing (1998: 137), for Wenger, is the \nability to participate in the practice of the community.  COPs are autonomous \ngroups that are self-organising and share a mutual commitment to a community, \nbuilt around activities commonly understood and continually renegotiated by its \nmembers.  Local SDI members contain COPs.  COPs emerge not necessarily \nalong organised group boundaries, but through interaction between particular \npeople.  Thus, within the Indian Alliance, there are sub-groups that form COPs, \nsuch as the group of four women who update the manual ledgers on daily savings, \nor the group that conducts daily savings rounds.  SDI is not a single COP, but a \n                                                                                                                                                                      \n \n 33 \nconstellation of COPs with varying forms and strengths of relationship with one \nanother.  Learning in COPs is a function of the alignment between experiences \nand competences.  This dialectic is helpful for understanding how learning about \nthe practicalities of, for example, daily savings and housing construction occurs in \nSDI.  \n \nExchanges are a means through which the poor can reflect on their own \nexperiences, become involved in practices in a given place and develop \ncompetences.  Exchanges are one of the ways in which, Patel, Bolnick and Mitlin \n(2000: 399) claim, the poor learn how to \u201cparticipate in their own development\u201d.  \nThis is learning through constellations of COPs.  For instance, in Bangalore, one \nmember of the Indian member of SDI I spoke to said that exchanges had taught \nher how to \u201edo\u201f savings.  The kind of competences she was referring to included \nthe daily practice of savings, such as getting individual passbooks to members, \narranging groups of around 50 people into collection areas, and drawing up and \ncompiling manual records.  One practical example she gave was the use of colour \ncoded money deposit boxes \u2013 for example, green for Rs. 1 or red for Rs. 2 \u2013 that \nhelps organise the scheme and make it accessible to slum dwellers.  In this \ninstance of a stabilised translation, learning occurs through the experience of one \ngroup driving the competences of another.  These competences are in turn altered \nthrough experience.  This occurs, for example, through groups mediating \nknowledge for their own places.  For example, groups may draw on the \norganisational form of daily savings but learn that in practice it is more fitting in \ntheir own place to have weekly or monthly savings than daily savings due to \n 34 \nearning patterns.  This is the case in Hyderabad, India, and in SDI areas in South \nAfrica and Thailand.   \n \nThe driving of competence through experience \u2013 new and old - indicates that \nlearning is uncertain.  New experiences, such as participation in a model house \nexhibition, can lead to competences in construction.  One example is the early \nexperimentation with housing construction in South Africa following exchanges \nwith the Indian Alliance.  New experiences led to new competences, and groups \nwere organised through social learning.  Leaders of the South African NGO \ninvolved \u2013 People\u201fs Dialogue \u2013 wrote that during a house-modelling exhibition: \n\u201cBy the time it came to assembly the four of us [from People\u201fs Dialogue] were on \nthe sidelines.  The members of the community were in charge of the house \nmodelling, giving advice, voicing disagreement, actively discussing the kind of \nhouses they would like to live in\u201d (People\u201fs Dialogue, no date: no pagination).  \nHouse modelling is a form of learning that is at one social, practical and material.  \nModelling is an example of learning-by-doing, marked by the development of new \ncompetences through new experiences.   \n \nSDI\u201fs approach to learning is closer to the image of a \u201elearning organisation\u201f than \nthat the Bank would claim for itself.  The Bank\u201fs insistence that \u201eglobal \nknowledge\u201f can be applied to different contexts as \u201ea solution\u201f militates against \nlearning, while for SDI learning is an ongoing process of working in practice, \nthrough groups of people working with materials.  This is not to say that SDI has \nan open-ended commitment to learning.  Indeed, SDI frames its mode of learning \nthrough a discourse of self-management that reflects an entrepreneurial notion of \n 35 \nthe poor and social change, in the process marginalising different modes of \ndevelopment intervention.  However, SDI\u201fs approach to learning as, first, a \nprocess of transformation rather than transmission, and second, as a process of \nlearning-by-doing in groups with materials, illustrates a post-rationalist \nperspective of learning.  Comparing the different approaches of the Bank and SDI \nhighlights the need to take seriously how learning is conceived and practised in \ndevelopment. \n \nConclusion \n \nWhile there has been some problematising of different types of knowledge, and of \nthe relationship between knowledge and information in development studies, there \nhas been little attention to the ontological and epistemological basis of knowledge.  \nSDI\u201fs conception of knowledge and learning represents an alternative politics of \nknowledge from that of mainstream development, which frames knowledge and \nlearning through a neoliberal post-Washington consensus.  In SDI, poor people\u201fs \nknowledge is placed at the centre of development, creating space for pedagogic \nlearning.  In doing so, SDI does not exclude knowledge from \u201eoutside\u201f the \nimmediate settlement and city.  Indeed, while \u201elocal\u201f knowledge, learning and \nstruggle are the focus of energy for SDI members, knowledge, learning and \nstruggle are all informed to varying extents by transnational engagement.  For \nmany SDI member groups, privileging the knowledge of the poor need not involve \nexcluding knowledge from \u201eoutside\u201f: indeed, they often actively seek to engage \nwith \u201eoutside\u201f knowledge, while simultaneously arguing that this knowledge must \nbe driven by other groups of the urban poor in other settlements rather than by \n 36 \nprofessional \u201eexperts\u201f.  In SDI, learning has no single spatial template, and \nknowledge is not divorced from its social or political contexts.   \n \nNone of this means that SDI stands as a simple counter-point to the World Bank, \nwith the former always \u201epost-rationalist\u201f and the latter always \u201erationalist\u201f.  The \ntwo sets of perspectives explored in this review are not opposite, but different, and \nindividuals at the Bank and SDI are, of course, capable of simultaneously holding \nversions of both sets of perspectives.  On a similar register, none of this is to \nromanticise SDI\u201fs work \u2013 indeed, there are certainly critics of the politics of its \nknowledge initiatives (McFarlane, 2004).  Rather, my concern here is to use the \nSDI analysis as a means for developing and demonstrating the use of a post-\nrationalist approach to knowledge and learning in development. \n \nMy intention has not been to suggest that there is a straightforward binary between \n\u201erationalist\u201f and \u201epost-rationalist\u201f.  Instead, I have sought to highlight a set of \npositions that actively work against a view of development knowledge as an \nobjective and universal \u201esolution\u201f that can be conceived unproblematically as \nseparate from context and politics.  Far from travelling in a linear way, knowledge \nalways changes as it moves.  Knowledge travels by always undergoing translation.  \nMaterials are important in the travelling of knowledge: for example, model houses \ntravel through SDI, and daily savings materials influence the conception and form \nof savings in different places.  The relationality of space is also important in the \ntravelling of knowledge.  The \u201emixing\u201f of different spaces creates new and shifting \nalignments of competence and experience in the learning process; learning occurs \nthrough a complex spatial ecology of \u201enear\u201f and \u201efar\u201f.   \n 37 \n \nThere is a need for greater sophistication in understanding the complexities of \nknowledge and learning and the relationship between travel, knowledge and place \nin development, because the ways in which these development rubrics are \nconceived has consequences for development practices.  For instance, the \ntendency in knowledge for development conceptions to privilege knowledge in \nline with neoliberalism, and to marginalise the knowledge of local people, has \nimplications for the ways in which development practice proceeds.  It has \nimplications, for example, for the types of knowledge for development projects \nthat are funded by donors (Ellerman, 2002).   \n \nInstead, we might argue for a focus on the knowledge of local people and for local \npolitics, and for geography as central rather than peripheral.  This does not mean \nthat, for instance, indigenous knowledge should necessarily be privileged over \n\u201eoutside\u201f or different knowledge.  Rather, I would argue for an approach to \nknowledge for development that involves the often difficult task of negotiating \ndifferent situated knowledges, such as indigenous knowledge, the position of a \ndonor or state body on a given issue, and so on.  This requires critical reflection on \nthe power relations of different agents such as the World Bank relative to, for \nexample, community-based organisations.  It also requires us to reflect on the \nsituatedness of \u201eWestern\u201f knowledge, often constructed as and assumed to be \nuniversally applicable, and to strive to recognise other ways of knowing.  \nFollowing Briggs and Sharp (2004), this requires more than a simple liberal \nrecognition of the views of the poor; it requires a radical attention to the different \nways in which the poor know, experience and understand development.  This \n 38 \napproach to knowledge for development requires a critical perspective on some \nkey questions, such as: how are knowledge and learning being conceptualised in a \ngiven situation?  From where has knowledge \u201eoriginated\u201f?  Is knowledge relevant?  \nWho decides whether it is relevant?  How can it be used (without simply trying to \nfollow the \u201eoriginal\u201f)?  How is it integrated with other forms of knowledge?  How \ndoes it relate to questions of power and autonomy?  How does learning take place \nin practice?   \n \nThrough examination both of mainstream development and SDI as a development \nalternative, a post-rationalist perspective has hopefully been shown to be useful \nfor analysing the conception and creation of knowledge and learning in \ndevelopment.  One productive means for advancing these debates in development \nstudies is through dialogue with perspectives emerging from organisational theory.  \nA post-rationalist perspective emphasises: the crucial role of practices in \nknowledge creation and learning, the importance of conceiving learning as a social \nprocess; the need to recognise spatial relationality in knowledge creation rather \nthan emphasising an \u201ein-here\u201f (local) \u201eout-there\u201f (global) ontology of knowledge \ncreation; the need to recognise the inherent material nature of knowledge creation; \nand most importantly the need to recognise that conceptions of knowledge and \nlearning are often highly political, whether from the World Bank or SDI.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe research for this paper was supported by an Economic and Social Research \nCouncil studentship (award number R42200034505).
