Introduction\nChirped gratings, resulting from natural or inten-\ntional variations in the properties and geometries\nof an otherwise periodic structure, have been exten-\nsively treated in the literature [1\u201314]. Analyses of\nchirped gratings are usually based on the coupled-\nmode (CM) theory, first proposed by Kogelnik [1].\nThe direct numerical integration of the CM\nequations along chirped gratings, as suggested by\nKogelnik [1], has been shown to agree well with ex-\nperimental results of mildly chirped gratings. Hong\net al. [2] have developed asymptotic approximations\nof the CM equations for linearly chirped gratings.\nFukuzawa and Nakamura [3] and Livanos et al.\n[4] have suggested a chirped grating reflectivity cal-\nculation method, which is based on the approximate\nform of the CM theory. In the approximate form, use\nis made of an \u201ceffective\u201d grating length\u2014defined\nas the distance over which significant reflectance\noccurs. Their approximation was found to agree\nreasonably well with the results of the direct CM\nnumerical integration.\nYamada and Sakuda [5] have suggested a method\napplicable to mildly chirped gratings, or \u201calmost per-\niodic\u201d gratings. Their method is a piecewise-uniform\napproach, in which the grating is divided into a num-\nber of segments of uniform periodicity, the CM equa-\ntions are solved for each segment, and the results\ncombined in a series of matrices. Erdogan [6] has\nconcluded that the approximation of the piecewise-\nuniform approach is in good agreement with the\nsolutions of the direct CM numerical integration,\nfor a variety of mildly chirped gratings. A similar ap-\nproach was taken byWeller-Brophy and Hall [7], who\nanalyzed chirped gratings using the Rouard method,\napproximating the grating as a stack of a finite num-\nber of slabs and determining the effective reflectivity\nof each slab by the CM theory. At the asymptotic\nlimit, where the grating is represented by an infinite\nnumber of slabs, the Rouard approximation becomes\nexact. Sipe et al. [8] have suggested an \u201ceffective\nproperties\u201d description of chirped gratings in the con-\ntext of the CM equations. A later study by Poladian\n[9] made use of that \u201ceffective properties\u201d descrip-\ntion to develop phase integral Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013\nBrillouin (WKB) approximate solutions of the CM\nequations for chirped gratings. These have been\nfound to agree with the results of the direct CM\nnumerical integration.\n0003-6935\/10\/112079-06$15.00\/0\n\u00a9 2010 Optical Society of America\n10 April 2010 \/ Vol. 49, No. 11 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 2079\nThe thermo-optic effects of intrinsic heating on the\nperformance of polymer fiber gratings have attracted\nrecent attention. Notable examples of such experi-\nmental studies include the work of Peng and Chu\n[10] on the photosensitivities of polymer optical fi-\nbers and use of fiber temperature changes to create\ntunable fiber gratings, the work of Liu et al. [11] on a\nthermal stability test for polymer fibers, which\npointed to a potential compatibility of polymers with\nsuch applications, and a more recent study by Littler\net al. [12], considering the effect of intrinsic heating\non the Bragg shift in an isothermal grating.\nConsideration was then extended by Kim et al. [13]\nto gratings with axial temperature gradients, cre-\nated by nonuniform intrinsic heating, leading to a\nnontraditional, \u201cthermally chirped\u201d Bragg grating.\nWhen exposed to a temperature gradient, the fiber\nBragg grating (FBG) optical properties will be al-\ntered in two ways: by a thermo-optic effect (varied,\nnonuniform, shift in the refractive index unrelated\nto the Bragg grating) and by a thermomechanical\neffect (varied, nonuniform, thermal expansion of\nthe material, altering the period of the Bragg grat-\ning). The nonuniformity of these effects along the\ngrating causes a chirp in the FBG. A model to pre-\ncisely characterize the optical behavior of such ther-\nmally chirped gratings must consider the axial\ngradient of the modulation wavenumber, which has\nbeen ignored in the original CM model.\nIn this study, a rigorous approach to modeling of\nthermal effects on thermally sensitive Bragg grat-\nings is suggested, in which the CM optical equations\nare rederived for thermally chirped polymer Bragg\ngratings.\n2. Modeling\nIn this analysis the Bragg grating is treated as a\nlarge number (N) of sequential elements, with reflec-\ntion occurring at the interfaces between elements\nand propagation within the elements. Considering\nthe jth element, the local jth wave amplitudes of\nthe forward (F) and the backward (R) waves are re-\nlated to the (j\u00fe 1)th amplitudes through the multi-\nplication of the complex transmission coefficient, the\ncomplex reflectivity matrix, and the propagation ma-\ntrices [14], i.e.,\n\u0001\nFj\nRj\n\u0002\n\u00bc 1\u03c4j\n\u0001\n1 \u2212\u03c1j\u0001\n\u03c1j 1\n\u0002\u0001\neikj\u0394z 0\n0 e\u2212ikj\u0394z\n\u0002\u0001\nFj\u00fe1\nRj\u00fe1\n\u0002\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the complex transmission coefficient and the\ncomplex reflectivity coefficient are given, respec-\ntively, by\n\u03c4j \u00bc\n2nj\nnj \u00fe nj\u00fe1\n; \u03c1j \u00bc\nnj \u2212 nj\u00fe1\nnj \u00fe nj\u00fe1\n; \u00f02\u00de\nThe complex refractive index for any element in\nthe grating can be expressed as the sum of the non-\nperiodic and the periodic contributions to the refrac-\ntive index variation, i.e.,\nn\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc n0\u00f0z\u00de \u00fe \u03b4neiB\u00f0z\u00dez: \u00f03\u00de\nThe modulation wavenumber, B\u00f0z\u00de varies along the\ngrating, i.e., B\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc 2\u03c0\u039b\u00f0z\u00de, where \u039b\u00f0z\u00de is the grating\nperiod.

The pro-\npagation wavenumber varies along the axial direc-\ntion as\nk\u00f0z\u00de \u00bc 2\u03c0\u03bb0\nn\u00f0z\u00de \u2248 2\u03c0\u03bb0\n\u00bdn0 \u00fe n0T\u0394T\u00f0z\u00de\u0002; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere n0 is the refractive index at the reference\ntemperature and n0T is its derivative with respect\nto temperature, i.e., n0T \u2261\ndn\ndT.\nThe optical behavior of such a nonisothermal poly-\nmeric Bragg grating is determined by three different\nmethods: the CM method, the thermally modified\nCM method (henceforth referred to as CMT), and\nthe exact method, which is a direct numerical calcu-\nlation based on Eq. (1) [or Eq. (4)] and does not con-\ntain any limiting assumptions. To obtain correct\nresults, the direct numerical solution must be per-\nformed using extremely small steps (\u0394z), typically\n2 orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength.\nTo assure convergence, in the present study \u0394z for\nthe direct numerical solution was taken equal to\n5:3nm.\nThe boundary conditions set the amplitude of the\nforward wave at the grating outlet to unity and the\namplitude of the reflective wave at the outlet to zero:\n\u0001\nFN\nRN\n\u0002\n\u00bc\n\u0001\n1\n0\n\u0002\n: \u00f012\u00de\nLinear normalization of the solution can further be\napplied to tune the results to different forward wave\namplitudes at inlet.\nFor the CM and CMT methods, numerical compu-\ntations are performed in \u0394z steps (j):\n\u0001\nf j\nrj\n\u0002\n\u00bc e\u2212aj\u0394z\n\u0001\nf j\u00fe1\nrj\u00fe1\n\u0002\n; \u00f013\u00de\nFor each step, matrix a is approximated as a con-\nstant, i.e., aj \u00bc a\u00f0z\u00fe\u0394z=2\u00de, and calculated by its\ndefinition [see Eq. (9)], where for the CM method\nB is set equal to zero. Equation (13) is then solved\nusing the boundary conditions:\n\u0001\nf N\nrN\n\u0002\n\u00bc\n\u0001\n1\n0\n\u0002\n: \u00f014\u00de\nFurther linear normalization of results, as noted for\nEq. (12), can be applied.\nThe numerical calculations of CM and CMT can be\nperformed in far fewer steps (larger\u0394z) than the \u201cex-\nact\u201d method since they only need to be smaller than\nthe relevant length scale of temperature change.\n4. Results and Discussion\nIn subsequent sections, thermo-optic results are gi-\nven for grated fibers made of glass and polymethyl\nmethacrylate (PMMA) polymer, respectively, and\nchosen to represent an extreme variation in the\nthermo-optic material properties of the Bragg grat-\nings. The relevant optical and thermal parameters\nof these two materials are given in Table 1 [13]. It\nis to be noted that the values of the thermo-optic coef-\nficient (dn=dT) and thermal expansion coefficient (\u03b1)\nof the PMMA polymer are much larger than those\nof glass.\nIn order to examine the effect of temperature non-\nuniformity on the optical behavior of a grating, the\nimpact of different temperature profiles on the power\nand spectral characteristics of the backward\/\nreflected light wave is evaluated with the aid of\n10 April 2010 \/ Vol. 49, No. 11 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 2081\nthe classic CM equations, the CMT equations, and\nthe exact numerical calculation, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows the individual and aggregated ef-\nfects of the mechanisms responsible for the thermo-\noptic behavior of a thermally chirped glass Bragg\ngrating, subjected to a steep exponential axial tem-\nperature variation, \u0394T \u00bc 85e\u22123:344zL, dropping from\nan excess temperature of 85K at the inlet to just\n3K at the outlet of the grating. The thermomechani-\ncal effect, due to the thermal expansion of the grat-\ning, is captured in the variation of the grating pitch\nwavenumber (B) and its axial derivative (B0). The\ntemperature sensitivity of the refractive index (n0T)\nis embodied in the variation of the propagating light\nwavenumber (k).\nBecause of the small thermal expansion coefficient\nin glass, however, it is observed that the thermome-\nchanical effect (B andB0) is quite small in comparison\nto the thermo-optic effect, and that, therefore, there\nare only minor differences between the predictions of\nthe CMT and the CM methods. It is noted that the\nmagnitude of the thermo-optic effect in glass is small,\ndue to its small thermo-optic coefficient, n0T (much\nsmaller than that of PMMA). Nevertheless, in the\nabsence of the thermo-optic compensation that can\noccur under small gradients in PMMA, the total\nBragg shift for the glass fiber under the stated con-\nditions reaches 0:1nm.\nFigure 2 shows the individual and aggregated ef-\nfects of the mechanisms responsible for the thermo-\noptic behavior of a thermally chirped polymer Bragg\ngrating, subjected to a steep exponential axial tem-\nperature variation, \u0394T \u00bc 35e\u22123:555zL, dropping from\nan excess temperature of 35K at the inlet to just\n1K at the outlet of the grating. It is clear from the\nfigure that the contributions of B and k to the reflec-\ntivity of a PMMA grating are almost symmetrical\nabout the Bragg wavelength, leading to significant\n\u201ccompensation\u201d between these two mechanisms\nand only a modest net Bragg shift. However, the com-\nbined thermomechanical contribution, including the\neffects of both the wavenumber, B, and the axial de-\nrivative of the wavenumber, B0, destroys this symme-\ntry. Consequently, while the solution of the classic\nCM equations (without the B0 contribution) suggests\nstrong thermo-optic compensation and a very modest\nBragg shift of 0:04nm in this PMMA grating (see also\nKim et al. [13]), inclusion of the B0 term in the CMT,\nderived specifically to deal with large axial tempera-\nture gradients, yields a significant Bragg shift and\nFig. 1.

The calculations\nwere performed for an assumed linear excess tem-\nperature profile, dropping from 5K above ambient\nat the inlet to 0K at the outlet of the grating.\nAt the Bragg wavelength, all three techniques\nyield a nearly monotonic increase in reflected power\nas the grating inlet is approached, but while the\ndirect numerical solution and the CMT method yield\nnearly identical results with a reflected power of\nsome 9%, the classic CM method substantially over-\npredicts the reflected power with a normalized value\nof 0.8. Examining Fig. 3(b), it may be seen that the\nclose agreement between the CMT approximation\nand the exact solution is maintained at a 0:1nm\nlower wavelength and reflects somewhat larger per-\niodicity than seen at the Bragg wavelength. But, the\nresults of the classic CM calculation display broad\nand unacceptable deviations\u2014in the shape and mag-\nnitude of the axial power distribution. This compar-\nison reveals that even a relatively modest axial\ntemperature variation (5K across a 10mm grating)\ncan produce significant \u201cthermal chirp\u201d effects.\nThe spectral variations in the power reflected by a\nPMMA grating, operating under different tempera-\nture profiles, i.e., a uniform temperature change of\n\u0394T \u00bc 35\u00b0, an exponential temperature profile from\n10K to 1K (\u0394T \u00bc 10e\u22122:303zL), and a linear tempera-\nture profile decreasing from an excess temperature\nof 10K at the inlet to zero at the outlet, are compared\nin Fig. 4. It is evident that in a PMMA Bragg grating,\neven a relatively small deviation from uniformity\nin temperature causes a significant shift in the re-\nflected power and in the wavelength of the maximum\nreflectivity, while for a uniform temperature profile\nthe overall thermo-optic effect is minor (small shift\nin reflected power versus wavelength behavior). This\nis due to the fact that in PMMA the effect of k and B\nresult in Bragg shifts of opposite sign and nearly the\nsame magnitude, thus leading to nearly complete\ncompensation. However, when the axial variation\nin the expansion of the grating is included in the de-\ntermination of the Bragg shift, through the contribu-\ntion of B0 to the CM solution, a decidedly asymmetric\nand complex spectral distribution emerges from the\nCMT methodology.\nIt is interesting to note thatPMMAgratings appear\nto be more sensitive to a linearly varying than to an\nexponentially varying temperature distribution. This\ncanbeattributed to a larger average value of zB0\u00f0z\u00de for\na linear temperature profile. These pronounced ef-\nfects of nonuniform temperature cannot be predicted\nby the original CMmodel since it ignores the effect of\nthe axial gradient of themodulation wavenumber,B0,\nFig. 3.

Asymptotically, as the segments be-\ncome infinitely small, the method becomes, at the\ninfinite limit, identical to the exact numerical calcu-\nlation. Hence, exact results will only be obtained\nfrom calculations that are as computationally inten-\nsive as the exact numerical method. Indeed, these\nstudies report the method to be useful only for mild\nchirps. These are not compatible with realistic ther-\nmal chirps in polymer fibers. Applying this method to\nthe thermally chirped PMMA fibers would yield re-\nsults largely between those obtained from the CM\nmodel to those obtained from the exact numerical\nmethod, with their numerical accuracy converging\nonly at the computational-intensivity limit of the\nexact method, hence offering no practical (or other)\nadvantage over the latter. Other methods [8,9] have\nsuggested semianalytical approximate solutions of\nthe CM equations for chirped gratings. These math-\nematical approximations were shown in those\nstudies to be successfully close to numerical calcula-\ntions of the CM equations (classical CM model) and,\nhence, are essentially simplifying approximations of\nthe numerical CMmodel. As such, they do not offer to\nproduce the substantially different behavior pre-\ndicted by the CMT model in this study, which was\nverified by exact numerical calculations.\n5. Conclusions\nA thermally modified coupled-mode model (CMT)\nwas developed to characterize the optical behavior\nof thermally chirped Bragg gratings. The CMTmodel\nenjoys the benefit of simplicity, as provided by the\noriginal CM model yet predicts the optical behavior\nof thermally chirped polymer Bragg gratings as accu-\nrately as the much more computationally intensive\nexact numerical calculation. Use of the CMT model\nhas revealed the importance of accounting for the ax-\nial variation in the thermomechanical terms in the\nBragg shift calculation to capture the aperiodical\ndistortion that can occur in nonisothermal polymer\ngratings.\nThe proposed CMT method was used to character-\nize the thermo-optic behavior of a PMMA FBG sub-\njected to various nonuniform temperature profiles. It\nwas demonstrated that even relatively small tem-\nperature nonuniformity can cause a significant shift\nin the reflected spectrum from the classical solution.\nReferences\n1. H.
