They used various mechanisms in seeking to foster an understanding of \nsocio-economic structures and hierarchies. The type of clothing that individuals, and \ngroups of individuals, wore was one of these. Through dress, the British could divide \nthe South Asian population into decipherable units and those units, in turn, could be \ndistinguished from Europeans. Photographers involved in the compilation of \nethnographic dictionaries during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, for \ninstance, dressed their subjects in what they believed to be \u2018typical\u2019 garments. These \nbecame visual signifiers of collective religious, caste or tribal (adivasi) status.2 \nAttempts to capture the essence of \u2018timeless\u2019 India, before the modernising colonial \nproject transformed it beyond all recognition, meant that this even extended to \nclothing photographic subjects in garments long since abandoned. Edward Dalton\u2019s \nDescriptive Ethnology of Bengal (1872) included a photograph of two Juang girls \ndressed in leaves, which Dalton himself acknowledged they no longer wore.3\n                                                 \n1 As is inevitable with research of this type, much of the material referred to here was picked up \ninadvertently, during research trips to India, Mauritius and London. These visits were funded by the \nBritish Academy and the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. I would like to thank them for \ntheir kind support. I presented an earlier version of this article at the Colonial Spaces, Convict Places: \npenal transportation in global context conference, University of Leicester, December 1999.

Clothing, together \nwith other bodily signs such as tattoos,4 hairstyles, moustaches and beards, were key \nto the identification of individuals for surveillance purposes. This was particularly \ntrue for those affected by the Criminal Tribes Acts. The first Criminal Tribes Act was \npassed in 1871, and at first extended across the North West Provinces, Awadh and the \nPanjab. By the mid-twentieth century, the Acts affected over thirteen million people. \nAs Sanjay Nigam shows, the disciplinary measures taken \u00fb registration, surveillance \nand resettlement - sought to reclaim individuals as \u2018moral subjects of the Raj\u2019.5 In a \nbid to identify those transgressing the terms of the Acts, police handbooks detailed the \ntypes of clothing typically worn by the criminal tribes. The oudhias for instance were \nsaid to wear a white linen cap, a white jacket and a short dhoti, and to carry an \numbrella and a stick. Such information, they believed, would facilitate arrest.6\nIncreasingly, clothing was also a means through which racialized social \nboundaries were established. In his work on colonial knowledge formation, Bernard \nS. Cohn has emphasized how cultural distancing - \u2018social separation\u2019 - between \nIndians and Europeans in South Asia was facilitated through differing dress.\n \n7\n                                                 \n4 On the use of decorative tattooing for surveillance purposes, see my own, \u2018Godna: inscribing Indian \nconvicts in the nineteenth century\u2019, in Jane Caplan, ed., Writing on the Body: the tattoo in European \nand North American History (London, 2000), pp. 105-6. \n Indian \nmen commonly wore either a basic loin cloth (langoti) or a longer waist cloth (dhoti). \nTheir upper body was either left uncovered or, in cooler weather, wrapped with a \nchadar (shawl). In some regions, a pagri (turban) completed the outfit.

As the \ncontemporary anthropologist Emma Tarlo shows, women either wore saris, long \npieces of plain or decorated cloth wrapped around the lower body with one end \ndraped over the torso, or long tunics (kamiz) and trousers (shalwar), with a veil \n(dupatta). Towards the end of the nineteenth century, blouses were also worn under \nthe sari.8 All were a stark contrast to European dress, which was heavily tailored and \noften restrictive.9\nBoth Indian and European dress, of course, varied considerably, largely on the \nbasis of class, status and gender. Yet as the East India Company consolidated its \ninterests in the subcontinent, and moved to end the social integration more common \nto eighteenth-century contact, clothing was increasingly viewed as a marker of the \ndesired racial separation between \u2018European\u2019 and \u2018Indian\u2019.\n  \n10 The 1857 Uprising was a \nmajor catalyst to this. While locally raised East India Company troops were initially \ndressed in \u2018native fashion\u2019 and military coats, they had gradually become more \nEuropean in appearance, wearing tight coatees with long tails. However, after 1857, \nwhen the army was reorganised, it became far more Indian in appearance. Sepoys \n(soldiers) were permitted to wear turbans and clothing became looser in style.11 \nAlready in 1830, the Company had banned civilian Europeans from wearing Indian \ndress at public functions. By the end of the century, Europeans ridiculed those Indians \nwho sought to emulate their clothing.12\nDespite this, throughout the nineteenth century it was common practice for \nIndians to wear European dress. In areas of European settlement Indians wore cast-off \n \n                                                 \n8 Emma Tarlo, Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India (London, 1996), p. 28. Tarlo contends \nthat Cohn\u2019s assertion that stitched clothing entered India with the Moghuls is incorrect.  \n9 Cohn, Colonialism, p. 130.  \n10 See also Christopher Breward, on how descriptive accounts of clothing were instrumental in \nnegotiating a sense of national identity and membership of the \u2018imperial race\u2019 in the metropole: \n\u2018Sartorial spectacle: clothing and masculine identities in the imperial city, 1860-1914\u2019, in Felix Driver \nand David Gilbert, eds, Imperial Cities (Manchester, 1999), pp. 238-53.  \n11 Thomas S.

In 1852, two indentured labourers returning from Mauritius were \nfound in possession of a Royal Artillery soldier\u2019s coat, several other articles of \nsoldiers\u2019 apparel and a police badge.13 By the 1890s, workers on the coffee estates in \nthe northeast were said to don soldiers\u2019 jackets, unsurprising given the cool climate in \nthe hills.14 In addition, entertainers, musicians and bandsmen in Calcutta all wore old \npolice and army hats, jackets, coats, buttons and pantaloons. There were frequent \nauctions of such goods.15 In Calcutta, there was even a shop where uniforms could be \nhired. W.H.H. Vincent, an official in the Twenty-Four Parganas district, reported in \n1896 of the \u2018foofoo bandsmen\u2019 who paraded in Calcutta, \u2018dressed up like slovenly \nsoldiers\u2019. This, he said, was a direct challenge to British prestige.16 J.A. Bourdillon, \nthe Commissioner of Burdwan, also wrote of the \u2018disreputable raggamuffins\u2019 who \nworked as musicians in Calcutta. He too was worried about the threat they posed to \nBritish \u2018dignity\u2019. Of greater concern to him were the increasingly common theatrical \nrepresentations of Europeans. Actors were apparently dressed up in European clothing \nand \u2018made the butt of the piece, and treated with every kind of indignity amidst the \nuproarious applause of the audience.\u201917\nWhen Indians wore European garb, the boundaries between colonizer and \ncolonized began to break down. Edgar Thurston, Superintendent of Ethnography, \nMadras, wrote with contempt in 1906 of the \u2018change for the worst [sic] in native male \nattire\u2019. The examples of declining standards that he cited included Indians wearing \nbrightly coloured caps instead of turbans, Bengali clerks donning patent leather boots \nand Indian cricketers\u2019 bright blazers, reminiscent of those worn by English public \n  \n                                                 \n13 India Office Records (IOR) P\/144\/20 (8 April 1852).

Yet clothing can also be \na means through which individuals have their identities fashioned for them.20\nThis article explores the issue of clothing in India\u2019s penal settlements. From \nthe late eighteenth to the mid twentieth centuries, the British transported tens of \nthousands of Indian convicts overseas to penal settlements in Southeast Asia, \nMauritius and the Andaman Islands. Removed from their supposedly criminal \nnetworks and put to work, convict offenders were apparently rehabilitated whilst \nconveniently satisfying colonial labour demands. The organisation of the penal \nsettlements relied on a division of convicts. According to skills, behaviour and \nproportion of sentence served, convicts could rise through the ranks of the penal \nhierarchy and be transferred from hard labour to preferred work tasks or positions of \nauthority over their fellow countrymen and women.  \n When \nindividuals use dress to cross those boundaries, profound anxieties arise.  \nThe most immediately visible marker of convict status was dress. By the mid-\nnineteenth century, a complex system of uniform clothing had evolved, delineating \nhow long convicts had been in the penal settlements and how they were employed \nthere; later, clothing was further adapted to indicate categories of crime. Initially, the \nevolution of convict dress was informed by developments in the Australian penal \n                                                 \n18 E. Thurston, Ethnographic Notes in Southern India (Madras, 1906), p. 520. .  \n19 Margaret Maynard, Fashioned From Penury: Dress as Cultural Practice in Colonial Australia \n(Cambridge, 1998), p. 2. Karen Sayer similarly argues that in Victorian Britain dress marked racial, \nclass and gender identities: \u2018 \u201cA sufficiency of clothing\u201d: dress and domesticity in Victorian Britain\u2019, \nunpublished paper presented at The Dress of the Poor, 1750-1900 conference, Oxford Brookes \nUniversity, 27 November 1999.  \n20 Tarlo, Clothing Matters, pp. 8 and 318.  \nsettlements. Later, and more significantly, initiatives on prison dress in India became \nimportant. However, as we will see, the development of penal clothing in the Indian \nconvict settlements overseas also had an agenda of its own. \n* \n As Margaret Maynard shows, penal dress was integral to the management of \nconvicts in Australia. The overwhelming majority of convicts were from the British \nIsles, as were most free emigrants. Clothing was thus a means through which the \nsocial hierarchy, between an overwhelmingly white community, could be ordered. \nFrom the 1790s, soon after the arrival of the First Fleet at Botany Bay, attempts were \nmade to develop convict uniforms. Problems with colonial supplies meant these were \neffectively standard working class dress. This often led to problems in distinguishing \nconvicts from free settlers. By the 1820s, convicts were more uniformly dressed, with \nconvicts issued with clothes that were numbered and marked with broad arrows.21 \nHierarchies between convicts were also outlined through clothing. Male convict \noverseers wore special dress whilst convict women were divided into classes, each \nwearing different clothes.22\n Given these developments in the main late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century \ndestinations for forced convict migrants from the British Isles, it is perhaps \nunremarkable that the principle of standardized dress was also extended to the Indian \nconvict diaspora. However, various contexts, differing imperatives and the long \nduration of the penal settlements in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean - almost 150 \nyears - resulted in a series of changes in its nature, function and significance.  \n  \n Unlike Australia where there were attempts to standardize dress shortly after \nthe first convicts arrived, during the early years of transportation from South Asia in \nthe late eighteenth century, no uniforms per se were issued. From the late eighteenth \nand early nineteenth centuries, male convicts were given standard \u2018Indian\u2019 clothing: a \npiece of white cloth, to be worn as a dhoti, on departure from the transportation jails, \n                                                 \n21 Maynard, Fashioned From Penury, chapter 1.  \n22 Ibid., p. 14 and 24.  \nAlipore (Calcutta), Tannah (Bombay) and Chingleput (Madras). Replacement \nsupplies were subsequently issued twice a year. For the whole duration of the \nMauritian settlement (1815-53), for instance, Patna chintz was imported for the use of \nconvicts there. Six yards of white cloth and a cumlie (blanket) were issued twice a \nyear.23\n Until at least the 1840s, there were no sanctions preventing convicts from \nwearing other clothes. Although they were transported in standard issue, many \nconvicts took supplementary clothing with them from India. The Superintendent of \nPolice, Bombay, wrote of the immense quantity of baggage one group of convicts \ntransported in 1839 had with them on embarkation.\n The East India Company provided a similar amount of clothing for convicts in \nits Southeast Asian penal settlements at Arakan, Bencoolen, Tenasserim, Singapore, \nMalacca and Penang. We know very little of the clothing worn by female convicts. So \nfew were transported - just six were shipped to Mauritius, for instance - that only \nsparse records survive.  \n24 In 1846, another contingent of \nconvicts\u2019 luggage capsized the boat on which they were being taken to their \ntransportation ship. One convict fell overboard and drowned.25 Clothing was taken for \none of two purposes: either personal use or as a potential means of exchange in \ncontraband trading.26 As convicts often worked in cool temperatures or in places \naffected by seasonal monsoons, additional clothing was very desirable. The need for \nwarmer clothing than the standard dhoti was only recognized in 1839, when, on the \nrecommendation of the Medical Board, and in response to concerns about high \nmortality rates, each convict was, in addition to standard cloth, issued with a coarse \nwoollen pair of trousers and jacket upon embarkation.27\n                                                 \n23 See indents on the Commissariat: Mauritius Archives (MA) RA54 (September 1817) and MA \nRA1067 (January 1850).  \n  \n24 IOR P\/402\/32 (17 April 1839).

First, until 1849, most transportation convicts from the Bengal and Madras \nPresidencies, including women, were tattooed on the forehead with penal godna \nmarkings, detailing their name, crime and date of sentence. This was both punishment \nand stigma, an indelible means of social differentiation. Convicts were thus readily \ndistinguished as convicts, no matter what they wore.28 Second, in most of the penal \nsettlements, and despite their wide-ranging regional origin, they formed a discreet \nethnic group. In Mauritius, for instance, before the onset of indentured immigration in \nthe 1830s, there was only a relatively small Indian diaspora on the island. Indian \nconvicts were thus easily recognizable, visually far removed from the white, creole \n(Mauritian-born), slave and, later, apprentice populations.29\n Convicts often possessed a substantial number of garments. During the annual \nMoharrum (Yams\u00e9) celebrations in Mauritius, for instance, convicts dressed to \nimpress. They apparently wore white and red turbans, plain and checked waistcoats, \n The same was true for \nBencoolen and the Straits Settlements (Malacca, Penang and Singapore). Indeed, \nwhite settlers\u2019 arguments against the transportation of Hong Kong convicts to the \nStraits in the mid-nineteenth century focused on the ease with which they would be \nable to escape by blending in with the free population, in contrast to those convicts \nalready there. Third, the colonial treasury made considerable financial savings by \nallowing convicts to wear their own clothes. Given each settlement\u2019s responsibility \nfor providing the cost of convict subsistence, this kept the cost of convict labour \ndown. Of course, if convicts wore different clothing, the colonial authorities were also \nable to differentiate between them. If the need for identification arose, as it sometimes \ndid when convicts were brought to trial for offences committed after transportation, or \ncommitted suicide, this could be to their benefit.  \n                                                 \n28 Anderson, \u2018Godna: inscribing Indian convicts\u2019, pp. 102-17.  \n29 The first Mauritian census (1826) recorded a composite category of 14 000 Indians, Chinese and \ncreoles, 9 000 whites and 63 000 slaves. Given the island\u2019s history as a slave colony, one must assume \nthat creoles formed the largest proportion of the composite category. Public Record Office (PRO) \nCO172.42. Baron d\u2019Unienville, Tableaux de Statistiques, tableau no. 6.  \nbrightly coloured jackets, knee-length trousers and leather belts.30 Yet even during \nnormal working hours, convicts on the island donned non-standard issue. Cotton \ntrousers and shirts, waistcoats and jackets were all commonly worn by convicts, in \nplace of or in addition to their dhotis.31 There is some evidence, for example, that \nMuslim convicts in Mauritius wore different clothing to Hindus, though this may also \nhave related to convicts\u2019 region of origin.32 Whilst convicts brought some of their \nclothes to the island, it is likely that many other items were soldiers\u2019 cast-offs, \nacquired through the complex networks of contraband trade already well established \nin Mauritius before convicts arrived. Indeed, convicts were commonly referred to as \nsepoys, which reflected the mistaken belief that they were soldiers imprisoned as \nBritish political prisoners.33 No doubt this image was compounded and perhaps even \nencouraged by convicts themselves, through wearing old army uniforms. When one of \nthe Indian convicts transferred from Mauritius to Madagascar in the 1820s, as part of \nBritain\u2019s policy of establishing friendly relations in the Indian Ocean, died, his \npersonal effects included a soldier\u2019s jacket, two black jackets, a turban and a piece of \nwhite cloth.34\n Despite efforts to contain it, the trafficking of stolen cloth was common \nthroughout the penal settlements.

A description of the clothing of two convict suicides is, for example, recorded at MA JI11, \nBhelo Kalipa, July 1831 and JI12, Renbella, April 1831. Mrs Bartrum, who lived in the colony \nbetween 1820-7, also noted that convicts wore white and red turbans.

Nevertheless, a \nhealthy traffic existed. In 1806, two convicts were executed for their part in the theft \nof cloth worth a massive $1200.35 After 1845, in an indication of the epic proportions \nthat contraband trading had reached, convicts in Singapore, Penang and Malacca were \nforbidden from selling or bartering their clothes or blankets.36 Stolen goods recovered \nin the Mauritian convict camps in the period 1819-40 included: a roll of twill cloth, a \nroll of silk, a roll of white cotton, a roll of blue cloth, a white shirt, a flannel shirt, a \npair of Nankin trousers, a linen jacket, a silk jacket, a linen handkerchief, a large \nwhite handkerchief with a red flowered pattern, two Chinese cr\u00eape shawls, two \n\u2018Indian caps\u2019, a Patna shawl, a Patna shirt, a waistcoat and 42 pairs of slippers.37\n The first attempts to standardize Indian convict dress came in the Southeast \nAsian penal settlements, from the late 1830s. This was some 20 years earlier than \ninitiatives in mainland Indian jails. In 1839 the Bombay authorities ordered that \nconvicts were to be transported with only a limited amount of clothing, to stop them \nmaking money by trading their clothes.\n \nCloth and clothing gave convicts social clout, both with their convict camarades and \nthe wider Mauritian community. This both facilitated their participation in economic \nexchange and, in these grossly gender-imbalanced penal communities, also gave them \nthe potential to attract female partners, convict or otherwise.  \n38\n                                                 \n35 IOR P\/129\/32 (1 January 1808).

The third class contained those promoted from the fourth class. \nPeons and those working for the Convict Department as overseers, or tindals, were \nplaced in the second class. First class convicts had already served 16 years of their life \nsentence (term convicts were never transported for more than 14 years) and were \nallowed to live out of the convict settlement. Each class had varying privileges, \nrelating to rations and money gratuities. Promotion and demotion between classes \nprovided both positive and negative incentives for good behaviour.39\nIn the early years of the penal settlements, convict overseers were simply \nissued with a \u2018belt\u2019.\n  \n40 The first attempt to clothe first class convicts - who were \nfrequently employed as tindals - differently came in 1850 when W.J. Butterworth \nprovided them with special uniforms. Some convicts initially refused to wear them. \nWe can only speculate why. Butterworth put their reaction down to caste prejudices, a \ntypical colonial reading of convict resistance to change in the penal settlements at this \ntime.41 Convict tindals themselves may have been more concerned about losing the \nautonomy to dress as they pleased, or at being so obviously differentiated from \nordinary convicts. In relation to the second point, it was later claimed that \nAndamanese tribals targeted convict overseers in the Andaman Islands during their \nattacks on working parties. Convict overseers thus often removed the visible symbols \nof authority - turbans, badges and belts - and carried tools when going out with to \nwork.42\n                                                 \n39 IOR P\/142\/37 (17 September 1845).

Additionally, first class Indian convicts otherwise employed were permitted to \nwear clothes of their choice.

Clothing was also used to express socio-racial divisions \nin the penal settlements. The handful of European convict warders - themselves \nticket-of-leave European prisoners convicted in India and shipped to the Straits \nSettlements \u00fb were issued with a light blue loose coat and a cap bordered with lace. A \ndistinctive badge, such as a hammer and chisel crossed for artificers, was given to \nindicate their grade.43\nThe initial difficulties Butterworth faced in issuing convicts with hierarchising \ndress raise a number of issues relating to the relationship between clothing and the \nnegotiation of power relations. One obvious implication of the standardization of \ndress was to ignore the possible significance of religion and\/or caste to individuals.\n Twice a year, the second, third, fourth and fifth classes were \ngiven nine yards of grey shirting, one jail suit, two working suits and a cap. The \noutfits - and use of fetters - differed slightly according to penal class. It seems likely \nthat women were given cloth to wear as a sari. This was certainly the case later on in \nthe Andaman Islands, as we will see.  \n44 \nAs David Arnold shows, in mainland Indian jails, religion and caste did impact upon \nprison discipline.45 Jail administrators wanted to standardize punishment, but they \nalso wished to avoid accusations that they were interfering in questions of caste, \nwhich could and did lead to episodes of prison unrest.46\n                                                 \n43 J.F.A.

In some jails \nprisoners\u2019 concerns were taken more seriously than in others, and were integral to \nprison management. Until the mid-1820s, the division of individuals according to \ncaste was integral to some regimes. Others ignored prisoner preferences and \nsegregated inmates according to their crime or sentence.\n \n49 In Alipore Jail in Calcutta, \nwhich had no system of classification at all, jail administrators commonly expressed \nthe sentiment that mixing castes prevented mass escapes.50 During the first half of the \nnineteenth century, the Bombay Presidency was by far the most willing to \naccommodate caste in jail. In 1824, the administration directed that Brahmins for \nwhom imprisonment risked loss of caste should, where possible, be accommodated \nseparately. At the very least, they should not be placed in the same cells as Muslims \nor low-caste Hindus and allowed to prepare their food separately.51 The 1838 \nCommittee of Prison Discipline, whilst acknowledging the diversity of jail \nclassification throughout India, later criticized Bombay in this respect.52 Officially at \nleast, \u2018caste prejudices\u2019 were not to affect prison discipline. In practice, from the \n1840s they were viewed as too important to ignore.53\n                                                 \n47 IOR P\/399\/33 (12 May 1824). W.

Broadly \nspeaking, the Mauritian and Southeast Asian penal settlements followed the Indian \npattern. Initially, there was great diversity between them. In Mauritius, convicts were \nnot messed together according to caste, but were given rations with which to prepare \ntheir own food. Additionally, officials sometimes took crude Brahminical \ninterpretations of the caste hierarchy into consideration when allocating convicts to \nparticular occupational tasks. Attendants on the Civil Hospital\u2019s convict wards, for \ninstance, were recruited from \u2018low-caste\u2019 men.54 Brahmins read out Convict \nDepartment notices in the convict camps.55 In the Tenasserim Provinces (Burma), at \nleast as late as 1838, convicts were messed together according to caste.56 Generally \nspeaking, however, it was more common for convicts in the early settlements to \nprepare their own rations. Indeed, when in 1835 a convict in Mauritius sentenced to \n20 years\u2019 hard labour for a secondary offence refused to eat his ready-prepared food, \nhe was given permission to prepare it himself in future.57 This was not the case during \nthe later period of the penal settlement in Singapore. Here, the mixing of convicts was \na deliberate policy and, as in certain Indian prisons, was seen as a safeguard against \nrevolts. W.J. Butterworth and J.F.A. McNair both echoed earlier opinions in India, \nwriting that mixing castes prevented threatening combinations.58\n With the drive towards uniformity in mainland Indian jails, questions of caste \nbecame inextricably linked to questions of dress. In 1855, a prison circular directed \nthat Bengal prisoners should only be in possession of the jail allowance of clothing.\n  \n59\n                                                 \n54 MA RA601.

No good in jail discipline and \npunishment can be effected by interference in such matters.\u201960 Other communities \nwere given similar concessions on dress. In keeping with its more accommodating \nattitude to prisoners\u2019 socio-religious status, in the Bombay Presidency Parsi prisoners \nwere allowed to wear sadras (long undergarments) and Brahmins sowla cloths, when \neating. Both were also allowed to wear a janwa and kasti.61 Christians, otherwise \nindistinguishable from their convict compatriots, were clothed differently throughout \nthe penal settlements. In the Tenasserim Provinces, for instance, they were given a kilt \nin lieu of a dhoti.62\n From the late 1830s, as more standardized prison uniforms were developed in \nthe penal settlements overseas, conflicts on the question of caste\/religion and dress \ninevitably occurred there too. Concessions on dress were, on occasion, granted to \ntransportation convicts. As we have seen, upon embarkation, transportees were issued \nwith standard convict dress. Yet, at least in theory, they were allowed to keep clothing \nconnected with religious duties or customs. In one instance, three Parsi convicts \npetitioned the Bombay Government in 1839 after a police constable forcibly removed \ntheir sadras before their embarkation to Penang and Singapore. The man responsible, \nWilliam Read, was called upon to explain his actions. He described how he had \nboarded the ship Adelaide to check the convicts were properly secured, had no \ndangerous weapons and had sufficient rations for the journey, continuing:  \n \n \nThe [Parsis] were dressed in their usual dress.

I took off the Turban of one and commenced \nuntying his angreka when they began to undress themselves and were \nvery abusive - I then observed that they had their convict trowsers on \nunder the others - I told them to take off their Suddra [sadra] which \nthey refused to do, on which I began to do it myself - one of them \nmade a blow at me, when I called one of the Police man [sic] to come \nto my assistance, and see that they took of the Suddra, when they took \nthem off themselves - as I was leaving, one of them came to me and \nvery violently held up his \u2018Kustee\u2019 which he told me I had better take \nalso but knowing this to be connected with their Religeon [sic] I \nrefused.63\n \n \nRead claimed that he had not been aware of the religious significance of the Parsis\u2019 \nclothes. The Sheriff of Bombay promised that there would be no future interference \nwith convicts\u2019 \u2018religious prejudices\u2019.64\n There was of course considerable space for convicts to manipulate colonial \nperceptions about religion or caste to their own advantage. In seeking concessions on \ndress, the problem for convicts was to convince officials that their clothing had a \nspecifically religious, as opposed to social status, connotation. Not all were as \nsuccessful as the Parsis discussed above. Shreerustna Wassoodewjee, a Bombay \nconvict transported to Singapore in 1846, petitioned: \n  \n \n                                                 \n63 IOR P\/402\/32 (1 May 1839). Statement of W.

The \nauthorities were still willing to grant concessions to high caste communities, but \nWassoodewjee only claimed he was a \u2018high class of Hindu\u2019 and the convict \nauthorities countered that he was not a Brahmin and thus no better entitled to \nsympathetic treatment than many other convicts.66\nPrison uniform in the Indian subcontinent was first introduced in the 1860s, \nsome years after it had been introduced for convicts transported to the Straits \nSettlements. At first, uniforms were not standardized and varied to some degree \nbetween districts. In 1860, F.J. Mouat, Inspector-General of Prisons in Bengal, \nrecommended the use of \u2018special prison dress\u2019, a check-patterned jacket and dhoti \nwhich he claimed would not affect caste,\n \n67 on what grounds are unclear. After the \n1864 Jail Committee, which recommended the division of prisoners into classes \naccording to their offence and \u2018character\u2019, dress was used as a distinguishing tool. \nThus in the North-West Provinces, Awadh, the Central Provinces, Mysore and Coorg \nand British Burma all prisoners wore a coloured badge - blue, white, red or yellow - in \norder to facilitate easy recognition of the penal class to which they belonged.68\n By the 1880s, Indian jail officials were particularly concerned that habitual \noffenders (those twice or more convicted) should be treated differently. In some \nregions, such as in Madras, this included their being photographed and worked \nseparately, in order to prevent them \u2018contaminating\u2019 other prisoners with their \n  \n                                                 \n65 IOR P\/404\/3 (6 August 1846).

In Bombay, from the 1880s, habitual offenders wore a \ndifferent uniform from other prisoners. In the Panjab, after 1885, all persons who \nwere suspected of having given a false name or refused to reveal their identity - and \nthus suspected of being habituals - were made to wear special jackets and hats. The \njackets had two dark blue stripes, three inches wide, running down each side. The \ncaps had one central blue stripe, also three inches wide, woven into the fabric of the \nclothes.69 Later, in Madras Presidency, a new \u2018penal stage\u2019 was designed as a harsh \nthree-month introduction to prison life. As well as sleeping alone and working at hard \nlabour (such as the treadmill), inmates would wear clothing made from rough, \nuncomfortable gunny cloth. Habitual thieves would be made to wear a blue cap.70\n The Andaman Islands were established as a penal settlement after the 1857 \nUprising and eventually replaced Southeast Asia as the destination for all Indian \ntransportation convicts. Initiatives on convict dress there were contemporaneous to \nthose on mainland India. At the time of settlement, the Islands were inhabited \nexclusively by aboriginals. As in earlier Southeast Asian and Mauritian penal \nsettlements, the need for a socially differentiating uniform was not, therefore, \nimmediately apparent. During the early years, each convict was given one anna nine \npice each year to clothe themselves.\n  \n71\nThe latitude convicts were allowed with respect to clothing probably \nfacilitated the replication of Indian social hierarchies. Convicts brought clothing with \nthem from India, and wealthier convicts had better garments.\n  \n72 Brahmins were \nallowed to wear the sacred threads.73\n                                                 \n69 NAI Home (Judicial), A proceedings, December 1886, nos 117-219.

This consisted of a short kurta and dhoti, stamped with \nthe convict\u2019s number, initially made of thin American drill cloth and later with cloth \nmanufactured in the Central Prison at Agra.76 By the turn of the century, the Andaman \nIslands had its own agro-industrial base, supplying many of the settlements\u2019 needs. \nClothes were made by female convicts working in the Female Factory.77 Men got two \nkurtas and dhoti cloths per year; women two saris, giving a clean change of clothes \ntwice a week.78 This surplus meant that it was possible for convicts working indoors, \nprotected from the elements, to hoard or barter spare clothes. One Madras convict \ninspected in 1890, who had been in the settlement for less than two years, for \ninstance, was found to have five suits of good clothing in his possession.79\n It is perhaps no coincidence that the first attempts to clothe convicts in \nuniforms came as the settlement became more socially complex. By the 1870s, large \nnumbers of convicts had been given tickets-of-leave on the condition that they settle \non the island as self-supporters. As things stood, there was no way of differentiating \nbetween them and convicts under sentence of transportation, or between convicts in \ndifferent penal classes. Superintendent D.M. Stewart made the first attempt to \nformulate a uniform in 1873, trying unsuccessfully to dye the cloth received from \nIndia (with what colour we do not know) before it was issued to the convicts. \nNevertheless, at the time of J.S. Campbell and H.W. Norman\u2019s report a year later, \nthere was a crude form of hierarchy-by-garment, though no proper uniform.

(Report of Lyall and Lethbridge). \nbottom three classes of convicts wore jail clothing; the top class their own clothes.80 \nOther indulgences followed this pattern. Convicts who reached the second class were \nallowed to cook their own food. Others refusing to eat in the common messing system \nwhich characterized the bottom classes were made subject to the harsh penal regime \nat Viper Island, a site of secondary punishment, where they could be coerced into \ndoing so.81 Although during the first decade of the penal settlement, convicts and self-\nsupporters were not distinguishable from each other, things were beginning to change. \nBy the early twentieth century, self-supporters and convicts dressed completely \ndifferently. Indeed, it was widely recognised that self-supporters would never don \nconvict issue.82\n As in Southeast Asia, convicts in the Andamans were integrated into the \nhierarchy of punishment. Thus convict jemadars (overseers) took their place in \noverseeing convicts. The organization of convicts in this way began on board \ntransport ships, where warders were selected on the basis of \u2018intelligence\u2019 and good \nbehaviour to oversee convicts. They wore a red cloth stripe around the right sleeve, \njust above the wrist.\n  \n83 Once in the settlement, convict warders were easily \ndistinguished from the penal labourers under their charge, clothed in red turbans, \nbadges and coloured belts. As in Indian jails, they had to buy their own uniforms, out \nof their gratuity money.84\n Another aspect to the organization of convicts in the islands was the use of \nEuropean ticket-of-leave convicts as overseers. Imprisoned in India, these men were \nselected for transfer to the Andamans on the basis of their fitness, labour skills and \nability to speak any of the Indian languages. Although technically not free men, as in \n \n                                                 \n80 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, August 1874, nos 51-84.

During this murder trial, one of the \nkey pieces of evidence was a bloodstained convict kurta. The accused, Sardar, claimed that he had \nbeen a self-supporter for too long to possess such a garment. On appeal, his conviction was set aside.  \n83 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, March 1875, no. 43. \n84 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, June 1890, nos 74-8. (Report of Lyall and Lethbridge). \nthe Straits Settlements European overseers were not expected to wear the same \nclothing as Indian convicts. Instead, they were clothed in what was effectively \nstandard British working-class dress. On departure from India, each man was issued \nwith four cotton or flannel shirts, trousers and socks (according to the season), two \nwoollen coats, one straw hat and two pairs of strong shoes. The implications of this \nracialized issue of dress went beyond the aesthetic. In comparison, Indian convicts \nwere issued with two suits of jail clothing and a blanket,85 the quality of which varied \nconsiderably from province to province.86 Inadequate clothing, particularly during the \nmonsoon when a dry change of clothes was frequently unavailable, almost certainly \ncontributed to sporadically high mortality rates in the settlement, in particular the \nincidence of dysentery.87\n By the time of Lyall and Lethbridge\u2019s 1890 report, it was clear that convicts \nwere to be explicitly classified through dress.\n  \n88 Clothing had clearly become part of \nthe disciplinary regime in the Islands - and a way in which convicts could counter it. \nConvicts were often caught wearing non-standard issue, and they were punished for \ndoing so.89 Lyall and Lethbridge made several further recommendations relating to \ndress. Notably, habitual thieves should be visibly distinguishable from other convicts, \non the grounds that they were more likely to reoffend than those convicted of serious \ncrimes, like murder. Their distinctive clothing would be changed if they had no thefts \nrecorded against them for a period of five years.90 In addition, by the end of the \ndecade, particularly \u2018dangerous\u2019 offenders such as dacoits (gang robbers) wore a shirt \nand dhoti marked with red cotton thread. Thieves wore a small red badge on their \nchests.91\n                                                 \n85 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, March 1875, no. 43.  \n  \n86 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, June 1890, nos 74-8.

In the Andamans, where during the second half of the nineteenth century male \nconvicts outnumbered female convicts by an average of ten to one,92 homosexual \nrelations appeared to be common. Commentators firmly distinguished active \nsodomites from passive recipients (catamites) and juvenile convicts were seen as a \nparticular target for older men. During the early decades, these \u2018lads\u2019 were locked up \nin lattice cages at night, within their barracks, in an attempt at segregation.93 This was \nby no means an ideal arrangement, particularly with regard to fire risks. As the \nsettlement expanded in the 1880s, all men and boys labelled \u2018habitual recipients\u2019 \n(catamites) were instead confined in and worked from altogether separate barracks.94 \nPublic flogging was used to punish convicts caught in flagrento.95\nIn addition, from 1887, catamites were made to wear brown-coloured clothing \nto ensure they lived and worked under close supervision. The merits of this \narrangement were fiercely debated at the time: W. Birch, Superintendent T. Cadell\u2019s \nassistant, argued: \n  \n \nThere are in my opinion great disadvantages attendant upon marking \nout by a distinctive dress (and thus advertising) habitual recipients ... \nin a community such as this every individual would become thus \npersonally known to all, in itself a great disadvantage as evil [sic] \ndisposed persons would thus at once be informed whom to approach \nwith solicitations.96\n \n  \n                                                 \n92 Satadru Sen, \u2018Rationing Sex: female convicts in the Andamans\u2019, South Asia, 30, 1 (1999), p. 29. \n93 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, April 1875, nos 16-19. \n94 This was noted, for instance, by Lyall and Lethbridge. \u2018Habitual recipients\u2019 were lodged in the \nAberdeen Barracks, one of the larges in the islands, and worked at stone breaking in Phoenix Bay. NAI \nHome (Port Blair), A proceedings, June 1890, nos 74-8. (Report of Lyall and Lethbridge). \n95 NAI Home (Port Blair), B proceedings, December 1880, no. 3. \n96 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, March 1888, nos 101-19.  \nThough there was a certain logic to his argument, Birch was overruled. Arguably, the \nensuing arrangement reproduced Indian social practices by sanctioning types of \nhomosexual behaviour. That sodomites were not clothed differently effectively \ndelineated what was considered masculine (active) or effeminate (passive) sexual \nbehaviour. The act of being penetrated itself was what was seen as \u2018corrupting\u2019.  \n A further development in convict uniforms in the Andaman Islands was the \nissue of \u2018neck tickets\u2019. As in Indian jails, each convict was given a metal neck ticket \non arrival in the settlement. Each was circular in shape, and detailed each individual\u2019s \nnumber, section of the Indian Penal Code under which convicted, date of sentence and \ndate release was due. Such information was similar to that previously inscribed in \nconvicts\u2019 forehead godna markings. If of \u2018doubtful\u2019 character, the ticket was also \nmarked with a \u2018D\u2019; if a member of a gang in India, with a star; and, if a life prisoner, \nwith an \u2018L\u2019. There were some problems with the tickets. Iron was a valuable exchange \ncommodity for the islands\u2019 indigenous inhabitants. In 1860, for instance, eight \nAndamanese raided a working party between Atalanta Point and Navy Bay, stealing \ntools and the convicts\u2019 tickets.97 Convicts may also have been open to barter. For this \nreason, from 1896 iron tickets were replaced with wooden ones.98 The tickets were \nworn during the first five years of a convict\u2019s transportation and could then be \nremoved for good conduct. Petty officers did not wear neck tickets.99 If convicts \ncommitted a secondary offence after the removal of their tickets, they could be \nreissued with one bearing the letter \u2018D\u2019.100\n                                                 \n97 Portman, A History of Our Relations, p. 303. Portman also notes a captured Andamanese had a \nconvict\u2019s ticket in his possession. Ibid., p. 318. \n Convicts were regularly punished for \nrefusing to wear their tickets. This was particularly pronounced when they were \n98 NAI Home (Port Blair), B proceedings, February 1896, nos 64-6. Existing convicts retained iron \ntickets, which explains why contemporary observers and secondary commentators offer conflicting \ndescriptions of neck tickets. R.C. Majumdar, Penal Settlement in Andamans (New Delhi, 1975), p. 131 \nand S.N. Aggarwal, The Heroes of Cellular Jail (Patiala, Panjab, 1995) claim that the tickets were \nwooden, in contrast to contemporaries Rosamund E.

A large \u2018S\u2019 was sewn on the clothing of those convicted \nof sedition; a \u2018C\u2019 denoted those convicted in conspiracy cases. All nationalist \nprisoners also wore neck tickets inscribed with a \u2018D\u2019, for \u2018dangerous.\u2019\n  \n102 This was \nquite unlike arrangements made for the reception of the Manipuri political prisoners, \nreceived in 1891, who had their own clothing sent from Assam.103 The Manipuris \nwere transported to the Andamans after a revolt against the British. Most were \nmembers of the royal family, which perhaps explains the more accommodating \nattitude towards their dress. For twentieth-century political prisoners marked in this \nway, contact with each other, at work or mealtimes, became difficult. Their ordinary \nprison dress was also one way in which the nationalist prisoners were associated with \nthe \u2018common criminals\u2019 with whom they were incarcerated.104 One such prisoner, \nNanigopal, refused to wear prison clothing and broke his wooden neck ticket so many \ntimes that it had to be replaced with an iron one.105 Another, Barindra Kumar Ghose, \nwrote in his memoirs: \u2018I understood that here there was no such thing as gentleman \n[sic], nor such thing as man, here there were just convicts\u2019.106\n* \n \n Related to the development of uniform convict dress was the close cutting, \nshaving and cropping of head and facial hair. In Indian mainland jails, haircutting was \nseen to have positive implications for hygiene, particularly the control of head lice. It \n                                                 \n101 See, for example, NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, August 1872, nos 1-2.

In particular, the threat \nof headshaving was a means to control female prisoners in a social context where \nother forms of corporal punishment were not sanctioned. Hair cropping was also used \non male and female convicts in the Indian penal settlements. It was not as common as \nin the Indian jails, but was used to punish refractory conduct after transportation. The \npresence or absence of head and facial hair was thus a visual tag through which \naspects of prisoner and convict status could potentially be discerned.  \nIn the Bengal Presidency, jail rules directed that all male prisoners have their \nhair and beard shaved off once sentence was passed. After 1856, to prevent the \ninnocent being stigmatised as guilty - a shaved head invariably pointed to an \nindividual\u2019s recent release from prison - this was altered to after the conclusion of an \nunsuccessful appeal. Prisoners were subsequently shaved every 15 days, by specially \nemployed barber prisoners. In an attempt to avoid the threat of prison unrest, \nexceptions were made on the basis of those religious distinctions which the \nauthorities thought were significant. Thus Muslims only had their hair and beard \nclipped with scissors. Sikhs, kols and Faraizis (Muslim reformists) did not have their \nhair or beards cut at all. The Inspector-General of Prisons, F.J. Mouat, required hair to \nbe reasonably short, but only if there were no religious sanctions against it. Otherwise, \nprisoners were forbidden from growing \u2018the long greasy, dirty, elf-locks in which they \nso much delight.\u2019107\n As for prison dress, the problem for jail officials was to ascertain whether \nprisoners objecting to hair or beard shaving did so on the basis of religion or caste, or \nother factors. There were invariably disagreements about prisoner objections. In 1857, \nfor instance, prisoners in Mymensing went on hunger strike in protest at having their \nbeards trimmed. The District Magistrate subsequently suspended the practice on the \ngrounds that the men were Muslims. Mouat on the other hand saw this a moral victory \n  \n                                                 \n107 IOR P\/145\/51 (27 November 1856). F.J. Mouat to C.J.

Lance, Magistrate of \nMymensingh, 8 May 1857.  \nwhich would make the future enforcement of jail rules difficult.108 Whilst claiming to \nbe sympathetic to prisoners, Mouat rarely conceded to their protests where they \nconflicted with points of discipline. Thus, by his own account, he refused to allow \nprisoners to cook their own food, wash their own clothes or sweepers to sub-divide \nthemselves in order to carry out prison cleaning duties. Prisoners\u2019 protests on these \nmatters were, he claimed, \u2018dignity objections\u2019, not in reality based on religious \ngrounds.109 Other colonial officials were nervous of the effect that this veiled \ndismissal of caste might have on jail order. The Junior Secretary to Government urged \nMouat to ensure that he was correct: \u2018Religious prejudices are not always to be set \naside, merely because they are mistaken.\u2019110\n During the 1860s and 70s, the Bengal rules on head shaving became more \nformally bound up with both Indian cultural practices and hierarchies within the jails, \nin particular the nature of the offence for which prisoners were convicted. Rule 193 of \nthe 1867 Bengal Jail Code exempted any prisoners, such as Sikhs, to whom cutting \nhair would be \u2018offensive or degrading\u2019;\n \n111 after 1870, only habitual offenders and \nthose sentenced to hard labour were close cropped upon their initial incarceration.112 \nIn British Burma, where men commonly had long hair, it was decided that, as in \nBengal, hair would only be cut on final confirmation of sentence.113 In what David \nArnold describes as an \u2018elaborate lexicon of bodily signs and ritual practices\u2019, \nBombay jail manuals made similar provisions.114\n                                                 \n108 IOR P\/145\/64 (25 June 1857).

At the same time, the 1886 Rules \nexpressly bound hair cutting to the prisoner hierarchy. Neither prisoners sentenced to \nsimple imprisonment nor convict warders were to have their hair cropped or \nshaved.115\n Whilst awaiting transportation, convicts were subject to the same rules as \nordinary prisoners, and so had their hair and beards cut. However, in the penal \nsettlements, convicts were allowed to let their hair grow, and cropping was not \ncommon practice. Indeed, none of the prisoners represented in J.F.A. McNair\u2019s \nSingapore photographs have been close cropped, even the fifth class \u2018incorrigibles\u2019. \nThis is somewhat surprising, given that hair cropping was used as a secondary \npunishment. One visitor to Port Blair in the early 1900s, C. Boden Kloss, saw some of \nthe inmates at Viper Island Jail, where recalcitrant convicts were sent, having their \nhair close cut.\n  \n116 This practice was only abolished in 1915, on the suggestion of the \nSuperintendent of Convicts at the time, Reginald Craddock.117\n Joy Damousi, in a provocative account of gender and sexuality in colonial \nAustralia, has explored the significance of headshaving female convicts there.

In Bombay, for \nexample, whilst headshaving was used extremely infrequently, just twice between \n1887-92 for instance, it seems to have had the desired effect - of providing a stick to \nbeat the prospect of female prisoner resistance. The Inspector General of Bombay \nPrisons reported that it was a more effective disciplinary tool than solitary \nconfinement or rationing, the only other options open to punish female prisoners, and \nlamented its potential withdrawal as a punishment.120\nThe assault on Indian womanhood which headshaving represented, and the \noutcry it could occasion, though little used in practice, led to its banning from Indian \njails in 1892. This was much earlier than its withdrawal from Southeast Asia. Yet \nheadshaving was still used as a secondary punishment. In the Andamans, women \ncould also be punished by hair cropping. Campbell and Norman noted this in their \n1874 report.\n \n121 Mrs Talbot Clifton, who visited the Islands in 1910, reported seeing a \n\u2018sullen-looking female\u2019 having her hair cut in the Female Factory there. Echoing her \ncontemporaries in India she noted: \u2018the greatest punishment which can be inflicted \nupon a woman who is ill-behaved in jail is to cut the delinquent\u2019s hair\u2019.122\n* \n Close \ncropping was not withdrawn from the Port Blair book of punishments until 1915. \n The development of penal dress in the Indian penal settlements reflected \nchanges in their structure and organisation. Integrally related to the abolition of godna \ntattooing in the mid-nineteenth century, clothing was used as a means to define and \nidentify convicts as part of a total population of forced labourers. Clothing and hair \ncutting also became mechanisms through which convicts could be integrated into the \nhierarchy of punishment, and showed their movements up and down the penal ladder. \nTurbans, badges and belts were all used to mark out convicts employed as petty \n                                                 \n119 NAI Home (Judicial), B proceedings, August 1886, nos 183-4.  \n120 NAI Home (Jails), A proceedings, December 1893, nos 117-9.  \n121 NAI Home (Port Blair), A proceedings, August 1874, nos 51-84. \n122 Talbot Clifton, Pilgrims to the Isles of Penance, pp. 127-8. \nofficers. Symbols of their authority, these adornments were representative of wider \nsocio-penal divisions between convicts: clothes marked types of offences, penal class \nand sexual identities. \nYet especially during the early years of the settlements, clothing and \nhead\/facial hair were spaces within which convicts could retain elements of their pre-\ntransportation identity. Convicts could wear clothing closely related to non-convict \nidentities, whether these were forged in India (region of origin, religion or caste, for \ninstance) or after shipment (perhaps independent economic activity and the \naccumulation of wealth.) Sometimes, the existence of these non-convict identities was \nsanctioned by the colonial authorities, either as a means to cut costs or foster social \nstability in the settlements. In other instances, convicts went directly against colonial \ndirectives on dress. Clothing was thus a medium through which convict identities \nwere both made and unpicked. If the penal authorities used clothing in an attempt to \nfashion convict identities, so too convicts refashioned their own status through dress.  \n"}
