For InGaAs\u0001P\u0002 \/ InP de-\nvices operating over the telecommunications range\n\u00011.3\u20131.6 \u0001m\u0002, it is known that Auger recombination plays\nan important role and is responsible for their high tempera-\nture sensitivity1\u20134. In order to understand these limiting pro-\ncesses and consequently to improve the performance of the\ndevices, it is necessary to separate the contribution of the\ndifferent recombination current paths.1\u20136 Hydrostatic pres-\nsure is an ideal tool to investigate the current paths and their\nvariation with band gap, and hence operating wavelength. In\nlong wavelength semiconductor multiple quantum well la-\nsers where leakage currents are small, it has been shown1,5\nthat the threshold current Ith can be written as the sum of\nmonomolecular \u0001\u0002n\u0002, radiative \u0001\u0002n2\u0002, and Auger \u0001\u0002n3\u0002 re-\ncombination currents, where n is the carrier density at thresh-\nold \u0001assuming that the hole and electron densities are equal\u0002.\nThus Ith=eV\u0001An+Bn2+Cn3\u0002 where e is the electronic\ncharge, V is the volume of the active region, and A, B, and C\nare the monomolecular, radiative, and Auger recombination\ncoefficients, respectively. Good growth quality means that\nthe monomolecular current is negligible in the InGaAs de-\nvices studied here.1,5 The relative magnitudes of the remain-\ning radiative and nonradiative currents have been experimen-\ntally studied via temperature and high pressure\nmeasurements.1,5 Previous analyses were based on the theo-\nretical assumption that for an ideal quantum well laser, the\nradiative current is proportional to the square of the band\ngap: Irad\u0002Eg\n2\n, where Eg is the band gap7 although this had not\nbeen experimentally verified at room temperature. The pres-\nsure dependence of the radiative current has already been\nverified at low temperatures using a helium gas pressure\nsystem.8 Since at cryogenic temperatures \u0001T\u0003120 K\u0002 all of\nthe injected carriers are involved in radiative recombination,\nIrad is obtained directly by measuring the threshold current.\nIn the work presented here, the band gap dependence of the\nradiative current is experimentally studied at room tempera-\nture where nonradiative recombination also occurs. In this\nexperiment, the radiative current is determined by collecting\nthe spontaneous emission emitted from a window milled in\nthe n-side substrate of the laser using an optical fiber. This\nensures that one is measuring pure spontaneous emission in-\ndependent of the effects of gain and loss along the cavity.5\nThe spontaneous emission is analyzed using an optical spec-\ntrum analyzer to ensure that we are collecting pure sponta-\nneous emission \u0001as evident from the shape of the spectra\u0002.\nThe amount of spontaneously emitted light is determined by\nintegrating the spectra at each current. The variation of the\nradiative current at threshold is determined from the pinning\nlevel of the integrated spontaneous emission.5 The facet\nemission light-current characteristic was also measured with\na broad area germanium detector. The devices were posi-\ntioned in a spring clip in a piston-in-cylinder high pressure\nsystem as described elsewhere.9 The lasers were driven by a\npulsed source with 500-ns-long pulses at a repetition rate of\n10 kHz to avoid internal heating. A set of 1.5-mm-long as-\ncleaved InGaAs\/ InP laser diodes emitting at 1.5 \u0001m was\ninvestigated. Their active region consists of four InGaAs\n0.6% compressively strained quantum wells surrounded by\nunstrained InGaAsP barriers. The 100-\u0001m-diameter circular\nsubstrate windows were milled by a Focused Ion Beam. The\nthreshold current densities of the devices \u0001\u0005900 A cm\u22122\u0002,\nmeasured before and after milling, were the same within ex-\nperimental error and hence we are confident that the milling\ndid not influence the lasing properties.\nThe results of the pressure measurements are shown in\nFig. 1. The threshold current Ith decreases by \u000523% over a\nrange of 8 kbars \u0001shown by the full squares\u0002, while Irad at\nthreshold increases by \u000510% \u0001open circles\u0002. Also shown is\nthe expected band gap dependence of the radiative current as\npredicted by simple theory, for which Irad\u0002Eg\n2\n.\n7 It can be\nseen that the measured radiative current increases less than\nthe simple Eg\n2 model. To replace this simple model, a more\nrigorous calculation of the radiative current was undertaken.a\u0002Electronic mail: s.sweeney@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 90, 161113 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/90\u000216\u0001\/161113\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics90, 161113-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nTo calculate Irad as a function of pressure, a six-band k \u00b7 p\nHamiltonian was used to determine the quantum well \u0001QW\u0002\nband structure, taking into account the changes in the effec-\ntive masses and band gaps as a function of pressure. Pois-\nson\u2019s and Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equations were solved self-\nconsistently in the calculation of both the conduction and\nvalence bands under injection. A five-point difference\nmethod was used to account for carrier spill-over into the\nbarrier and separate-confinement regions. The spontaneous\nemission rate, gain, and radiative current density were calcu-\nlated from these band structures for single QWs using the\ndensity matrix formulation including Lorentzian-type broad-\nening. Further details of the modeling can be found in Ref.\n10. As pressure is applied to the lasers, the wavelength de-\ncreases by \u0005114 nm over 8 kbars. This leads to a narrowing\nof the optical field while the dimensions of the active region\nremain approximately constant. The corresponding pressure-\ninduced variation of the optical confinement factor \u0004 \u0001the\noverlap of the optical field with the quantum wells\u0002 was ac-\ncounted for using the effective index method.10 We find that\nwhen all these changes with pressure are included the agree-\nment with the experimental Irad\u0001P\u0002 is poor \u0001dashed line in\nFig. 2\u0002, suggesting that yet another factor should be taken\ninto account. In earlier work, we showed that the internal\nloss at room temperature and atmospheric pressure \u00050 of\nthese 1.5 \u0001m lasers is 10 cm\u22121.5 Including this as a pressure\nindependent loss results in the dotted line in Fig. 2. While\nthis offers better agreement it still overestimates the rate of\nincrease of radiative current with pressure. The origin of the\ninternal loss in lasers operating at these wavelengths is due\nto intervalence band absorption11 whereby a photon is ab-\nsorbed by an electron in the spin-orbit band which is excited\nto the highest \u0001heavy hole\u0002 valence band. While the photon\nenergy increases with pressure, the spin orbit splitting re-\nmains relatively constant.12 Thus, with increasing pressure,\nin order to satisfy the conservation of energy, the transitions\ninvolved in intervalence band absorption move away from\nthe Brillouin zone center where the hole occupation becomes\nless, therefore reducing the intervalence band absorption\nrate. To take this into account, to first approximation we\nassume that the intervalence band absorption loss \u0005i varies\nlinearly with pressure as \u0005i=\u00050\u2212\u0006P, where P is the pressure\nin kilobars and \u0006 is a constant equal to the rate of change in\nloss with pressure. Over the studied pressure range, we find\nbest agreement with the experimental data for \u0006\n=0.5 cm\u22121 kbar\u22121, as shown by the solid line in Fig. 2. This\ntherefore suggests that the intervalence band absorption loss\nreduces by \u000540% over 8 kbars.\nThe fact that the radiative current increases with pressure\nwhile the threshold current decreases with pressure confirms\nthat there is a strong nonradiative Auger current path present\nwhich decreases with increasing pressure. Temperature mea-\nsurements show that Irad forms 20% of the threshold current\nat room temperature in these devices with the remaining 80%\ndue to Auger recombination.1,2,5 This result together with our\npressure dependence data allows us to experimentally deter-\nmine the band gap dependence of the Auger current IAug\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0002. It is shown in Ref. 13 that the Auger process known\nas CHSH \u0001where the energy of a C\u0001 onduction band electron\nrecombining with a hole in the H\u0001 eavy hole band is given to\na third hole in the H\u0001 eavy hole band which is excited into the\nS\u0001pin split-off band\u0002 dominates in these devices. We may\ntherefore calculate the pressure \u0001band gap\u0002 variation of the\nAuger coefficient given by C= IAug\/eVpth\n2 nth for the CHSH\nAuger process using the calculated pressure dependencies of\nthe electron and hole densities at threshold \u0001nth and pth, re-\nspectively\u0002.

Based on\nthis, C can be extrapolated to wider band gaps \u0001inset, Fig. 3\u0002,\nwhere, for example, it is found to be 50% less at Eg\n=954 meV \u0001\b=1.3 \u0001m\u0002 compared to C at 1.5 \u0001m.

We find that the\nsimple model given by Irad\u0002Eg\n2 is insufficient to describe the\nexperimental data. However, good agreement was found us-\ning a full band-structure calculation if the pressure depen-\ndence of the optical confinement factor and internal losses is\ntaken into account. Our calculations show that the decrease\nin the internal losses due to reduced intervalence band ab-\nsorption plays a significant role in reducing the pressure de-\npendence of the radiative current. Based on our measure-\nments we are able to experimentally determine the band gap\ndependence of the Auger current and the Auger coefficient C.\nThe authors would like to thank Igor Marko for assis-\ntance with the experiments.\n1S.
