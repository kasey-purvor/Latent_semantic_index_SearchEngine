The scale and speed of natural enemy range\nexpansion and the likelihood of shifts to non-target hosts\nare particularly crucial when predicting community\nimpacts of intentionally released biological control agents\n[1].

Species in one\nmajor clade of Andricus gallwasps have lifecycles invol-\nving host alternation between two oak lineages - the\nblack oaks of Quercus section Cerris (e.g. Q. cerris and\nQ. suber) and the white oaks of Quercus section Quer-\ncus (e.g. Q. robur and Q. petraea). In the Western\nPalaearctic natural co-existence of these two oak sec-\ntions (and hence host-alternating gallwasps) is restricted\nto southern Europe, Asia Minor and the Middle East;\nonly section Quercus oaks are native to Europe north of\nthe Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians [9,10]. However,\nover the last 400 years the region in which both oak\nsections grow together has been dramatically expanded\nby widespread human planting in northern and western\nEurope of Turkey oak Q. cerris (Figure 1), a section Cer-\nris species native to central and eastern Europe and Asia\nMinor. This introduction has triggered multiple inva-\nsions by a suite of host-alternating gallwasps, reaching\nnorthwards to Scotland and westwards to the northern\nslopes of the Pyrenees [8,9,11]. Genetic data show that\nall invading gallwasp populations have originated from\nwithin the native Balkan range of Q. cerris, with no\nrange expansion by Iberian peninsula populations\n[9,10,12]. In Iberia, cork oak (Q. suber) replaces Q. cer-\nris, and Iberian gallwasp populations have proven unable\nto make the host switch from Q. suber to Q. cerris that\nis necessary for northwards range expansion.\nThis study concerns the response of the third trophic\nlevel to gallwasp range expansion. Oak gallwasps sup-\nport rich communities of parasitoid natural enemies\n[8,13], and gallwasp range expansions triggered by plant-\ning of Q. cerris represent continental-scale experiments\nin the assembly of such communities. Parasitoids have\nrecruited onto range-expanding gallwasps in invaded\nregions [11,13,14], but their origins remain unclear.\nHowever, determining where these parasitoids come\nfrom can reveal underlying mechanisms in gallwasp\ncommunity assembly. If shared spatial histories and co-\nevolution (including local adaptation) underpin species\ninteractions [5,15], we expect invading gallwasps to be\n1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n15\n16\n17\n18\n14\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32 33\n34 35\n3637\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n4445\n46\n47\n48\n4950\n51\n52\n53\n5455\n5657\n58\n59\n63 62\n66\n67\n60\n61\n64\n65\n0 500 1000 1500Kilometres\n69\n68\n70\nFigure 1 Map indicating Megastigmus stigmatizans sampling locations and the major European Quercus section Cerris oak\ndistributions.

This model allows exploitation of\ninvading hosts by parasitoid populations that have no\nrecent history of exposure to invaders but that attack\necologically similar hosts (the Host Shift Hypothesis).\nMore specifically, whilst this hypothesis does not pre-\nclude some degree of host pursuit from the Balkans, it\nadditionally predicts that expanding parasitoid popula-\ntions could escape from Iberia even though their gall-\nwasp hosts have not.\nA third scenario potentially applies to this gallwasp sys-\ntem, involving co-introduction of both gallwasps and\ntheir parasitoid enemies (the Introduction Hypothesis).\nAccidental co-introduction is a feature of community\ndevelopment around invading hosts [16] and is possible\nbecause galls (and unintentionally their occupants) have\nlong been traded as a source of tannins for the manufac-\nture of inks and dyes [[9] and references therein]. The\nsource for such galls was the eastern Mediterranean (par-\nticularly Lebanon and south-eastern Turkey), with\nRoman Italy as the major historical destination. More\nrecently, vast numbers of galls of the host-alternator\nAndricus kollari were imported into south-western\nBritain from the eastern Mediterranean during the 1840s\n[9]. Andricus kollari rapidly colonised Britain, and genetic\ndata show these introduced populations were derived\nfrom at least two eastern Mediterranean sources [9]. It is\nlikely that parasitoids also escaped from these imported\ngalls, but it remains unknown whether any populations\nsuccessfully established. However, if they did establish we\nwould expect British and Italian populations (but not\nother European populations) to exhibit genetic variation\ndiagnostic of the eastern Mediterranean.\nThese three hypotheses can be discriminated using\npopulation genetic data for parasitoids specialising on\nhost-alternating gallwasps, whose populations in northern\nEurope therefore must also be invading or introduced.\nOur approach is to use a combination of mitochondrial\nsequence and nuclear microsatellite data to identify\ngenetic variation diagnostic of southern and eastern\nregions relevant to our hypotheses. Screening of invaded\nrange populations then allows assessment of the support\nfor the Host Pursuit, Host Shift and Introduction Hypoth-\neses (genetic variation shared with the Balkans, Iberia or\neastern Mediterranean, respectively). The use of multiple\nnuclear markers plus the independently evolving mito-\nchondrial genome also allows further examination of the\nhistories of range expanding populations, such as the\nextent to which invading populations from different ori-\ngins maintain their genetic distinctiveness, or the role of\nsex-biased dispersal [17,18].\nHere we apply this approach to the parasitoid Mega-\nstigmus stigmatizans (Chalcidoidea, Torymidae). This\nspecies is native to southern Europe (including Iberia),\nAsia Minor and the Middle East where it attacks predo-\nminantly both widespread and refuge-specific host-\nalternating gallwasp species, and also now attacks\ninvading gallwasp populations throughout northern\nEurope (see Table 1) [14,19]. Additionally, we target this\nspecies as information from it is relevant to ongoing\nwork on a related Asian torymid parasitoid, Torymus\nsinensis, recently released in Italy in an attempt to con-\ntrol an introduced and invading gallwasp pest of chest-\nnuts [20,21]. Native oak gall parasitoids have been\nreared from this invading gallwasp, indicating that oak\nand chestnut gallwasp communities are trophically\nlinked [20]. We know of no study to date of the poten-\ntial impacts of this release on native Western Palaearctic\ngallwasp communities, so patterns shown by M. stigma-\ntizans may reveal possible outcomes.\nMethods\nSample collection\nWe reared 247 M. stigmatizans specimens from host galls\ncollected throughout the Western Palaearctic and stored\nemerged adults at -20\u00b0C in 100% ethanol. At least 20 indi-\nviduals were sampled from a range of hosts in each of\n10 major regions relevant to our three hypotheses: Iran,\nLebanon, Turkey, the northern Balkans (Hungary and\neastern Austria), Italy, Germany\/central France, western\nFrance, Spain\/Portugal, Morocco, and Britain (Figure 1,\nAdditional file 1). Smaller numbers were obtained from\nthe southern Balkans (Greece and Bulgaria). Our analysis\nincorporated 29 previously sampled individuals from\nIberia and western France [19] and 17 additional samples\nfrom this region. Only one M. stigmatizans individual was\nsampled from each gall to minimise any impact of sam-\npling siblings on population genetic analyses.\nMolecular methods\nSequencing procedures followed Nicholls et al.[22]. A\n590 base pair fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome\nb gene (cyt b) was amplified for all samples using the\nprimers CP1 and CP2 [23]. This fragment gave a total\nof 55 haplotypes, with 47 variable positions (22 parsi-\nmony informative). To increase signal from the mito-\nchondrial genome, one individual from all but four of\nthe cyt b haplotypes was also sequenced for the Folmer\nbarcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I\ngene (COI; 652 base pairs) using the primers LCO and\nHCO [24]. This added a further 23 variable characters,\n14 of which were informative. One individual of the\nNicholls et al.

Sequences are available\nfrom GenBank, accession numbers FJ026622-FJ026729.\nTo increase resolution of genetic structure and to cor-\nroborate the independent evolutionary status of mito-\nchondrial lineages [25], we genotyped 227 of the 247\nindividuals for 13 nuclear microsatellite loci (Mst2, Mst3,\nMst4, Mst6, Mst9, Mst11, Mst12, Mst13, Mst14, Mdo1A,\nMdo6, Mdo7 and Mdo11) following protocols in Garnier\net al.[26]. PCR fragments were sized on an ABI 3730\ncapillary machine and scored using ABI\u2019s custom soft-\nware GeneMapper v4.0.\nPhylogenetic inference from mitochondrial DNA\nBasecalling of sequences was confirmed using Sequence\nNavigator[27]. Sequences were checked for an open read-\ning frame and aligned using DNAstar (DNAstar Inc.,\nMadison WI, USA). Phylogenetic relationships among\nunique M. stigmatizans cyt b haplotypes were recon-\nstructed using MrBayes v3.1.2 [28]. The data were parti-\ntioned by codon position, with substitution rates allowed\nto vary among partitions. Since some categories of trans-\nversions were not present within each partition the data\nwere initially modelled using a HKY+I+G model for each\ncodon position. This model was then simplified following\nthe procedure in Nicholls et al.[22], resulting in HKY+I\n+G, HKY and HKY+I for first, second and third positions\nrespectively. MrBayes analyses incorporated two indepen-\ndent runs of 6,000,000 generations, each with 4 chains\nand a temperature of 0.15. Parameters and trees were\nsampled every 1000 generations, with the final 500,000\ngenerations used for assessing tree topology and node\nsupport. Convergence of parameters between runs was\nassessed using Tracer v1.4 [29].\nFor the combined cyt b and COI data, partitioning by\nboth gene and codon position produced similar para-\nmeter estimates for corresponding codon positions and\nthe same tree topology as partitioning by codon position\nonly, so final analyses used this simpler three partition\nmodel. Application of the procedure described above for\ncyt b resulted in adoption of HKY+I as the model for\neach codon position, with a constant clock-like mutation\nrate.\nAnalyses of microsatellite data\nIndividuals were screened for 13 loci (see Additional file\n1) with 3 to 32 (mean = 13.9) alleles per locus. As\nwasps are haplodiploid, with haploid males and diploid\nfemales, only diploid (i.e. female) genotypes were initi-\nally used to assess concordance with the assumptions of\nfurther population genetic analyses. We tested for\ndepartures from Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equili-\nbrium using Arlequin v2.001 [30] within each of the\nsampling regions specified above. Significance levels\nwere adjusted for multiple tests using a sequential\nBonferroni correction and a table-wide alpha of 0.05.\nSignificant departures were obtained for 23 of 113 tests\nof Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and 16 of 6259 tests of\nlinkage equilibrium; however, these departures showed\nno consistency across loci or populations so all data\nwere included in subsequent analyses.\nTable 1 Occurrence of Andricus and Cynips gallwasp hosts for Megastigmus stigmatizans within the Western Palaearctic\nhost code host species Iberia central Europe eastern Mediterranean northern Europe\n1 A. caputmedusae yes yes\n2 A. coriarius yes yes yes\n3 A. coronatus yes yes\n4 A. curtisii yes yes\n5 A. dentimitratus yes yes yes\n6 A. grossulariae yes yes yes invader\n7 A. hungaricus yes\n8 A. infectorius yes yes\n9 A. kollari yes yes yes invader\n10 A. lucidus yes invader\n11 A. megalucidus yes\n12 A. pictus yes\n13 A. quercuscalicis yes invader\n14 A. quercustozae yes yes invader\n15 A. sadeghii yes\n16 A. sternlichti yes yes\n17 C. longiventris yes yes native\n18 C. quercusfolii yes yes native\nAll galls attacked are induced on Quercus section Quercus oaks by asexual generations.

In these analyses, the second (non-existent) allele\nin males was coded as missing to allow inclusion of\nboth male haplotypes and female genotypes in one ana-\nlysis; separate analyses using only the male or female\ndatasets gave almost identical results (data not shown).\nAnalyses incorporating K values of 1-16 were run for\n1,000,000 generations with a burn-in of 100,000 genera-\ntions, with convergence in estimated parameter values\nchecked over 10 independent runs for each K. An\nadmixture model was used, allowing individuals to have\nancestry from multiple populations, with population\nallele frequencies assumed to be independent.\nRelationships among the clusters found by Structure\nwere assessed using only those individuals with limited\nevidence of admixture (a minimum of 80% of their\ngenotype assigned to a single population). Nei\u2019s genetic\ndistance [32] was calculated between all pairwise com-\nbinations of clusters and then used to construct a\nneighbour-joining tree in PHYLIP[33]. Node support\nwas assessed from 1000 bootstrap replicates based on\nresampled data matrices of loci across clusters. A sec-\nond metric based on pairwise FST between clusters was\nalso calculated, and gave almost identical results (data\nnot shown).\nResults\nRegionally diagnostic genetic structure in M. stigmatizans\u2019\nnative range\nGenetic variation in both mitochondrial and microsatel-\nlite datasets was diagnostic of major regions across the\nnative range of M. stigmatizans, with strong concor-\ndance between an individual\u2019s mtDNA lineage and the\ncluster to which the majority of its microsatellite geno-\ntype was assigned (c2 = 449.8, d.f. = 21, P \u2248 0). Three\nwell-supported regional clades were resolved in the cyt\nb (Figure 2; named the European, Iberian and Lebanese\nlineages) and combined mitochondrial (Figure 3) data-\nsets, with multiple Turkish and Iranian haplotypes dis-\ntinct from the major lineages. The microsatellite data\nprovided greater resolution, with strongest support for\neight population clusters (posterior probability of ~1 for\nK = 8) showing similar geographic structuring to the\nmitochondrial data (Figure 4). Few individuals showed\nsignificant evidence of admixture (microsatellite alleles\noriginating from different clusters; see Additional file 2),\nsuggesting limited migration between these spatially\nseparated populations. Balkan populations were charac-\nterised by cyt b haplotypes in the European lineage and\nmicrosatellite genotypes in cluster 3. Iberian populations\nwere characterised by cyt b haplotypes in the Iberian\nlineage and microsatellite genotypes in clusters 1 or 2.\nEastern populations were the most genetically diverse\nfor both marker types, and were characterised by cyt b\nhaplotypes either in the Lebanese lineage (Lebanon,\nIran) or in a distinct central polytomy (Turkey, Iran),\nwith microsatellite genotypes in clusters 4-8. This\nregionally-diagnostic variation allowed unequivocal\ninference of the origin of invading M. stigmatizans\npopulations across their non-native range.\nOrigins of non-native M. stigmatizans in northern Europe\nThe molecular data show that all three hypothesised\nmechanisms have contributed to range expansion in\nM. stigmatizans. The Host Pursuit Hypothesis is sup-\nported by assignment of cyt b sequences from Britain,\nFrance and Germany to the European lineage (Figure 2),\nand the observation that European microsatellite geno-\ntypes dominate populations in Germany and south-\neastern Britain (cluster 3 in Figure 4). While Italy could\npotentially have been the source of these European gen-\notypes, none of the other microsatellite clusters that are\npresent at high frequency in Italy (clusters 4, 5 and 8)\noccurred further north in continental Europe, indicating\nthat these northern M. stigmatizans populations are\nderived from the remainder of the refugial distribution\nof cluster 3 in the Balkans, as is the case with their\nhosts. Notably, European lineage mitochondrial haplo-\ntypes were more widespread than microsatellite geno-\ntypes from the same origin, occurring through all but\nsouthern-most France and throughout southern Britain.\nGenetic diversity within the European mitochondrial\nlineage declined with distance from the Balkan origin\n(only five European lineage cyt b haplotypes were\nobserved in northern Europe compared to 10 in the\nBalkan peninsula), and haplotype 6 was particularly\nwidespread and abundant (found in 54% of European\nlineage individuals and occurring throughout the\nlineage\u2019s geographic range).\nThe Host Shift Hypothesis was supported by the pre-\nsence of Iberian lineage cyt b haplotypes in central and\nnorthern France (Figure 2), and widespread occurrence\nof cluster 2 microsatellite genotypes across France into\nsouth-eastern Britain (site 70; Figure 4). As with the\nEuropean mitochondrial lineage, northern populations\nshowed reduced diversity with haplotype 38 dominant;\nhowever, some individuals sampled from central France,\nnorthern France and Britain that were assigned to the\nIberian microsatellite cluster 2 had European lineage\nmitochondrial haplotypes (see Additional file 2).\nThe Introduction Hypothesis was supported for both\nBritain and Italy by inclusion of cyt b haplotypes from\nthese regions in the Lebanese lineage (Figure 2). Cluster\n8 in the microsatellite data also showed the same disjunct\ndistribution, at high frequency in Britain and some Italian\nNicholls et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:322\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/10\/322\nPage 5 of 12\npopulations, and low but significant frequency in some\nMiddle Eastern populations (Figure 4; Additional file 2).\nNeither the mitochondrial Lebanese clade nor the micro-\nsatellite cluster 8 occurred in geographically intervening\nregions, thus excluding the possibility that any natural\nrange expansion event could have given rise to this pat-\ntern. The dominance of microsatellite cluster 8 in south-\nwestern Britain is striking, with all but one microsatellite\ngenotype from sites 67-69 allocated to this cluster; the\nfinal genotype showed admixture with another eastern\npopulation, the Iranian cluster 7. Equally striking is the\nlack of nuclear admixture between south-western British\npopulations and the microsatellite genotypes found in\nsouth-eastern Britain and neighbouring continental\nEurope; however, European lineage mitochondrial haplo-\ntypes were sampled from south-western individuals (see\nAdditional file 2). These patterns strongly support the\nIntroduction Hypothesis for British M. stigmatizans, with\nno subsequent cross-Channel genetic exchange with\nmainland Europe other than in the south-east.\nThe Introduction Hypothesis also explained microsa-\ntellite genotype patterns seen in Italy. These populations\nare genetically diverse, with contributions from central\nEurope (cluster 3) and multiple eastern populations\n(clusters 4, 5, 7 and 8). However, in contrast to British\npopulations, more than a third of Italian individuals\nshowed a strong signature of genetic admixture between\nthese sources (see Additional file 2). The distribution of\nalleles shared by Britain or Italy and other populations\nunderlines support for the Introduction Hypothesis.\nNineteen alleles were shared only by Britain or Italy and\neither Lebanon or Turkey (Figure 5). Other than five\nalleles shared between Italy and central Europe (a pat-\ntern expected given the evidence grouping these popula-\ntions) no other region shared alleles exclusively with\nBritain or Italy, supporting a process of introduction\nfrom these eastern source populations.\nDiscussion\nThe complex invasion history of M. stigmatizans\nOur results reveal a complex invasion history for\nM. stigmatizans in northern Europe, with strong sup-\nport for all three invasion hypotheses.

This is consistent\nwith the known import of host galls to Britain during\nthe 1840s [9,35]. Eastern genotypes in Italy probably\nderive from much earlier trade, perhaps dating back to\nRoman times [9]. Genetic data for British A. kollari sug-\ngested introduction from two distinct sources, neither of\nwhich matched sampled populations [9]. A similar pat-\ntern applies to M. stigmatizans; although some British\nand Lebanese cyt b sequences indicate a close relation-\nship, none of the sampled eastern populations share the\ndominance of microsatellite cluster 8 characteristic of\nsouth-western Britain, and clear structure in the micro-\nsatellite data argue against the cluster 8 source popula-\ntion being in southern (cluster 5) or northern (cluster 6)\nLebanon. One possibility is that the dominance of clus-\nter 8 in Britain results from a genetic bottleneck in the\nintroduced population [10]. However, the existence of a\nparallel pattern with no obvious loss of genetic variation\nFigure 4 Distribution of the eight clusters identified in the Structure analysis of Megastigmus stigmatizans multi-locus genotypes.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:322\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/10\/322\nPage 8 of 12\nin introduced A. kollari suggests the presence, at least in\nthe 1840s, of a genetically discrete oak gall community\nin an eastern Mediterranean region that we have yet to\nsample. Neighbour-joining analysis grouped cluster 8\nwith the Turkish cluster 4, so this unknown source\npopulation may have been north of Lebanon, perhaps in\nSyria or south-eastern Turkey as was also suggested for\nA. kollari and consistent with Aleppo, in Syria, being a\nprobable centre of the oak gall trade [9]. Although this\nputative origin could potentially be located by more\nsampling, extensive deforestation in this region since the\nmid-nineteenth century [36] may mean that the intro-\nduced eastern genotypes of both host and parasitoid\nthat dominate British populations no longer exist at\ntheir geographic source.\nModes of range expansion in M. stigmatizans\nOur data show that persistent patterns have established in\nthe nuclear genetic structure of non-native M. stigmati-\nzans populations. In southwestern Britain, eastern geno-\ntypes have persisted for 170 years with no evidence of\nsignificant cross-Channel gene flow from western France.\nOn mainland Europe, both Balkan and Iberian populations\nhave spread without known human assistance over at least\n1000 km of previously unoccupied habitat over at most\n400 years, with little evidence of mixing except where both\ncontribute genetic diversity to the extreme southeast of\nBritain. The persistent integrity of eastern genotypes in\nBritain and evidence of limited cross-channel gene flow\nparallels exactly the pattern seen in A. kollari [9]. Other\ngallwasp invasions indicate that these insects can cross the\nChannel without significant loss of genetic diversity [10],\nso lack of dispersal is unlikely to explain the observed pat-\ntern. Instead, the first arrivals may have established a\ngenetic dominance in populations that was resistant to\nrare arrivals from genetically divergent populations, as pre-\ndicted by leptokurtic dispersal models [37,38]. Such\ngenetic dominance can establish very quickly [10], so rapid\nestablishment of host-shifting colonists from Iberia could\nalso explain why central European genetic diversity in\nM. stigmatizans is conspicuously absent from France. This\ncontrasts with extensive genetic admixture between multi-\nple eastern and European populations in Italy which is\nconsistent with co-existence over much longer timescales,\na pattern mirrored in refugial Spain and Lebanon where\nmultiple microsatellite clusters have a long history of\nco-existence.\nHowever, patterns in the mitochondrial genome differ\nsubtly from those described above for the nuclear gen-\nome. Introgression of central European haplotypes into\nboth Iberian and eastern nuclear backgrounds was seen\nin France and Britain, respectively. This perhaps indi-\ncates a degree of uni-directional female-biased dispersal\nfollowed by backcrossing with local populations, or\nalternatively introgression of selectively advantageous\nBalkan mitochondria. Either way, it highlights the inabil-\nity of populations invading from multiple sources to\nmaintain complete genetic distinctiveness. So although\ngenetic diversity within specific source lineages\ndecreased as populations expanded northwards [see also\n[10]], total genetic diversity at the limits of the non-\nnative range remained high due to contributions from\nmultiple source lineages. This parallels patterns seen in\nother taxa expanding their distributions, either naturally\nor with human assistance, across Europe from multiple\nsources [9,39].\nHost shifts and the evolution of oak gall communities\nThe ability of Iberian M. stigmatizans to colonise France\nhighlights the fact that herbivores and their natural ene-\nmies may face very different constraints on range expan-\nsion. While Iberian gallwasps have failed to shift from\nQ. suber in Iberia to Q. cerris north of the Pyrenees,\nM. stigmatizans was able to shift from Iberian hosts to\ninvading hosts once these came within reach. Unlike\nother species [40], no discernable population bottleneck\naccompanied this shift, suggesting the invaders were easy\nto exploit as hosts. Ability to exploit unfamiliar hosts is\nalso supported by the genetic data in Britain. Eastern\nM. stigmatizans genotypes must originally have been\nassociated only with co-introduced eastern A. kollari.\nHowever, our sampling revealed eastern M. stigmatizans\ngenotypes in individuals attacking another gallwasp host,\nA. quercuscalicis. This gallwasp invaded Britain from the\nBalkans in the late 1950s [10] and is absent from the east-\nern Mediterranean (Table 1). Eastern origin M. stigmati-\nzans must thus have shifted host from A. kollari to\nA. quercuscalicis in the last 50 years, equating to a maxi-\nmum of only 50 generations as M. stigmatizans is univol-\ntine. Recent additional British sampling has also revealed\nM. stigmatizans attacking a novel native gallwasp host,\nBiorhiza pallida (K. Sch\u00f6nrogge & J.A. Nicholls unpubl.\ndata). These host shifts in France and Britain suggest\nthat oak or gall traits required for host recognition by\nM. stigmatizans are broad enough to accommodate any\ndivergence among host populations in different regions\nof the Western Palaearctic that have been separated for\nmultiple glacial cycles [19,41,42], implying co-evolution-\nary interactions such as local adaptation between refugial\npopulations of M. stigmatizans and its gallwasp hosts are\nweak or non-existent. Although the timescale of such\ndivergence is difficult to estimate, the most recent inter-\nglacial allowing possible mixing of oak communities\nbetween Iberia and central Europe was around 130,000\nyears ago [43]. However, both the mitochondrial tree\n(Figure 3) and the microsatellite data (insert in Figure 4)\nindicate that Iberian and central European populations\nhave a non-sister relationship, suggesting that these\nNicholls et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:322\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2148\/10\/322\nPage 9 of 12\npopulations have had independent evolutionary histories\nfor a much longer period on the same timescale (or\nlonger than) the divergence between European and Mid-\ndle Eastern populations. It has been argued that the mas-\nsive range shifts caused by Pleistocene glaciations [44,45]\nmay have selected against highly co-evolved species asso-\nciations in favour of a degree of generalist opportunism\n[46]. This may explain why most oak gall parasitoids\nexploit suites of hosts sharing similar gall phenotypes\n[47]. Thus patterns in M. stigmatizans, and in oak galls\nmore generally, support a major and continuing role for\necological sorting in the recent assembly of these\ncommunities.\nWhile M. stigmatizans and its gallwasp hosts have dif-\nfering invasion histories in northern Europe, they share\nsimilar patterns of genetic diversification across their\nnative ranges. The major divisions between M. stigmati-\nzans lineages in Iberia, central Europe and the Middle\nEast correspond to major Pleistocene refugia for many\nWestern Palaearctic taxa [44,45]. The placement of Ira-\nnian and Turkish sequences in a central unresolved\npolytomy in the cyt b tree (Figure 2) and the basal pla-\ncement of the Lebanese lineage in the combined mito-\nchondrial analysis (Figure 3) also support an overall\neastern origin for M. stigmatizans. These patterns are\nshared with other oak gallwasp and parasitoid species\nexamined to date [9,12,22,41,48,49] supporting hypoth-\neses of an eastern origin for Western Palaearctic oak\ngallwasp communities as a whole [7].\nImplications for the release of biocontrol agents\nOak gallwasp communities illustrate several major issues\nassociated with impacts of introduced species on native\ncommunities. Substantial changes in community struc-\nture can develop rapidly [11,13,14,20], and parasitoids\nassociated with invading hosts can reach very high\npopulation densities, with potential impacts on native\nhosts through apparent competition [11,13,50]. In addi-\ntion, limitations to range expansion experienced by their\nhosts are irrelevant to parasitoids as long as suitable\nalternative hosts exist. This significance of biotic interac-\ntions on species distributions has been described in\nother systems, and underlines the risk of applying cli-\nmate-envelope approaches to modelling community\nlevel responses to perturbation [3,51,52]. Megastigmus\nstigmatizans shows that understanding range expansion\nin parasitoids, and predicting impacts in associated com-\nmunities, requires identification of the factors defining\ntheir host choice, and hence of the potential for range\nexpansion via host shifts. This issue is of immediate\nrelevance in Europe, where the biocontrol agent Tory-\nmus sinensis has been released to control the invading\nchestnut gallwasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus. Although\nT. sinensis is an effective biocontrol agent previously\ndeployed in Asia and America [20,21], its ability to\nattack non-target hosts remains largely untested. Chest-\nnut gallwasps are recognised as hosts by native oak gall\nparasitoids [20], so T. sinensis may likewise attack native\noak gallwasps. If so, the potential exists for it not only\nto pursue its invading pest host, but also (as M. stigma-\ntizans has done) to shift to non-target hosts and dis-\nperse much more widely in the Western Palaearctic.\nUntil this parasitoid\u2019s ability to exploit non-target hosts\nis understood, the wider impacts of its ongoing release\nremain impossible to predict.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the major role for\necological sorting processes in the recent assembly of\ncomplex communities in response to anthropogenic dis-\nturbance. Different trophic levels may face very different\necological constraints on range expansion, resulting in\nvarying phylogeographic histories of species interacting\nwithin the same community. The multitude of origins of\ninvading natural enemy populations in this study\nemphasises the diversity of mechanisms requiring con-\nsideration when trying to predict the consequences of\nhuman-mediated ecological perturbations such as biolo-\ngical invasions or the intentional release of biological\ncontrol agents.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Collection details and genetic data for each\nsampled Megastigmus stigmatizans individual.
