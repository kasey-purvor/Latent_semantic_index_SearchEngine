It describes a small-scale qualitative study\nof work\u2013life balance as it is experienced within a low-income neighbourhood in the UK. The\nstudy findings are used to inform reflections on the powerlessness experienced by many working\nparents seeking to accommodate family life with paid employment; and on the nature of the\ncalculative responsibilities that are imposed upon working parents by recent shifts in social\nand labour market policy. It is contended that policy makers should tip the balance of the\nwork\u2013life equation from the current preoccupation with business interests in favour of wider\nsocial responsibility concerns.\nIntroduction\n\u2018Work\u2013life balance\u2019 is a protean term. It can signify at one extreme a managerial\nstrategy designed to maximise employee performance (Employers for Work\u2013life\nBalance, 2006), or it may at the other portend an opportunity to re-evaluate\nthe ethical basis of social welfare provision in post-industrial capitalist societies\n(Williams, 2001). This article will identify the key controversies that surround\nthe idea of work\u2013life balance, before outlining findings from a study of the\nexperiences of work\u2013life balance in a low-income neighbourhood in the UK. The\narticle will draw on that study in order: first, to discuss the relative powerlessness\nof many workers and the inherent unpredictability of their experiences of work\u2013\nlife balance. Second, it will discuss the ambiguous ways in which social policies are\ncalibrated to achieve work\u2013life balance and the particular difficulties experienced\nby working parents in calculating how to combine paid employment with family\nlife. The conclusion will argue for an approach based not on the business case,\nwhich will invariably tip the balance in favour of economic productivity, but\nupon the needs of households, which would tip the balance in favour of social\nresponsibility.\n520 hartley dean\nContexts\nEarlier notions of work\u2013family reconciliation and family-friendly employment\npolicy were ostensibly driven by concerns for gender equality, but the policy\nagenda has lately been firmly concerned with notions of \u2018work\u2013life balance\u2019\nand more generally with labour market behaviour (Lewis, 2002). The work\u2013life\nbalance agenda lies at the intersection of two secular trends: one, a shift in global\npolitical and economic orthodoxies from a Keynesian demand-side approach to\nmonetarist supply-side policies; the other, social-demographic shifts associated\nwith a tendency in post-industrial capitalist societies toward a decline of the male\nbreadwinner household and a corresponding rise in both dual-earner and lone-\nparent households. Work\u2013life balance is therefore set in the general context of\nlabour market policies concerned with maximising labour flexibility and labour\nmarket participation, and policies aimed at adapting social welfare provision\nto the changing dynamics of the household economy (Esping-Andersen, 1999,\n2002).\nIn the specific UK context, the New Labour government has repeatedly\nindicated a concern with policies intended to make it easier to combine paid\nemployment with the responsibilities of family life (Department for Trade and\nIndustry, 2000, 2005; Home Office, 1998). This has entailed explicit employment\nmeasures relating to rights to maternity and paternity leave and pay; provision\nfor parental leave; and a right for parents with young children to request flexible\nworking arrangements. More generally, the government promoted a national\nWork\u2013Life Balance Campaign by which it has sought voluntary compliance by\nemployers with the principles of a work\u2013life balance approach (Department for\nTrade and Industry, 2001). The wider context of these initiatives, however, has\nbeen a triumvirate of \u2018joined-up\u2019 policy initiatives addressing labour market\nparticipation, income maintenance and childcare provision, respectively.\nWelfare-to-work policies\nOn the premise that paid employment is the best remedy for family poverty\n(Department of Social Security, 1998), the government created \u2018New Deal\u2019\nprogrammes intended to compel certain unemployed groups to engage with\nthe labour market, while also enabling and encouraging other groups, such as\nlone parents, disabled people and the partners of unemployed people, to do\nso. Engagement with such programmes has since become compulsory for most\nwelfare recipients of working age and there are proposals for extending this\n(Department for Work and Pensions, 2006). The approach is consonant with\na wider European Employment Strategy, which sets targets for labour market\nparticipation (European Commission, 1997, 2002, 2006).\nPolicies to \u2018make work pay\u2019\nComplementing the \u2018stick\u2019 of welfare-to-work has been the \u2018carrot\u2019 of a\nnational minimum wage and a new system of tax credits (that replaced previously\ntipping the balance 521\nexisting means-tested in-work supplements for low-paid workers with families).\nThe national minimum wage was symbolically significant, but its impact was\nlimited since it was initially set at a very modest level. Despite more recent\nincreases, it is currently barely half the national average wage (Department for\nTrade and Industry, 2006; Exell, 2001). The new tax credit system is substantively\nmore important, not least because it has had a significant redistributive effect\nand has played some part in reducing or containing the number of children\nwho live in poverty in the UK (Hills and Stewart, 2005). Subject to a means test,\nthe Child Tax Credit is available to all families with children, and the Working\nTax Credit is available to all households in which one or more adults are in\nfull-time employment. The original precursor of the tax credit scheme had been\nintroduced in 1973 by a Conservative government which, faced by a growing\nproblem of in-work poverty, elected for a selective wage supplement in preference\nto an increase in the universal family allowance (Dean, 2002b). At that time, the\nonly precedent for such intervention had been the \u2018Speenhamland system\u2019 of\npoor relief introduced in parts of England in the late eighteenth century, when\nlocal magistrates used public funds to supplement starvation level wages that\nwere then in payment to farm labourers: it was a system abhorred at the time\nby free-market liberals who contrived eventually to have it swept away under the\nmore rigorous Victorian Poor Law (de Schweinitz, 1961). That something so like\nthe Speenhamland system should have become attractive to free-market liberals\nin the post-industrial age is indicative of a supply-side economic orthodoxy that\nno longer has need of a reserve army of labour in order to keep wages low and\nwhich assumes that low-paying employers must be enabled to compete in a global\nmarket economy.\nA national childcare strategy\nThis was aimed at increasing the level of daycare provision, the expansion\nof early years education, the promotion of after-school clubs, the provision of\nchildcare tax credits to offset the cost of registered childcare facilities, and special\nprovision in deprived areas through the \u2018Sure Start\u2019 scheme. While the level\nof childcare provision has improved, it remains beneath that in other Western\nEuropean countries (Daycare Trust, 2005). And, while there are now plans to roll\nout the provision of Sure Start centres throughout the country to provide for\nchildren under four years old and their parents, evaluation studies have suggested\nthat the integrated services delivered by the Sure Start scheme have not necessarily\nbenefited the very poorest families (Clarke, 2006; National Evaluation of Sure\nStart, 2005). It has been argued that the package of early childhood measures\ndeveloped under New Labour was driven less by an understanding of the needs\nof young children and rather more \u2013 once again \u2013 by a preoccupation with the\neconomic supply side, with a desire to improve the effectiveness of early years\neducational experiences, to limit the adverse effects which poverty was assumed\n522 hartley dean\nto have upon productivity in later life, and to enable adults more easily to combine\npaid employment with parenting (Moss, 2000).\nFrom the policy makers\u2019 perspective, the promotion of work\u2013life balance may\nbe seen as a response to global pressures upon the structure and functioning of\nlabour markets on the one hand and shifting patterns of household formation and\nin the age-mix of the population on the other (for example, Scharpf and Schmidt,\n2000). It is necessary that post-industrialised economies should maximise the\nlabour market participation of the working-age population, while recognising\nthat certain labour market sectors will be characterised by work that is low-paid\nand\/or insecure. From the employers\u2019 perspective, work\u2013life balance may be seen\nas a means of maximising labour-force productivity (Bloom et al., 2006; Dex\nand Smith, 2002). In a competitive economic environment, employers would\nlike workers to be \u2018flexible\u2019 (which may entail part-time, irregular or anti-social\nworking hours) and plentiful (because this helps keep wages low). To this extent,\nemployers are likely to welcome anything that national governments do to help\nworkers juggle their lives around their jobs or that enables those who might not\notherwise have been able to work to do so. Such intervention assists the supply\nof low-skilled, low-paid labour required in service industries and throughout the\nlabour market periphery. More particularly, however, in the high-skilled, high-\npaid core of the post-industrial economy, employers may be willing selectively to\nembrace the work\u2013life balance agenda for themselves, since there is a \u2018business\ncase\u2019 for doing so. Employers may be keen, for example, to offer concessions\nin order to retain the services of professionally skilled mothers, especially if the\nemployer has previously invested in their training and careers (Dean, 2002a).\nIn one sense, work\u2013life balance is about very different kinds of flexibility: the\nflexibility demanded by employers and the flexibility required by households.\nThe balance of power between employers and households is such that it is\nhouseholds that must by and large adapt their survival strategies to accommodate\nthe demands of the labour market. Richard Sennett has argued that the flexible\nnature of labour processes in the \u2018new\u2019 capitalism is inherently corrosive: not just\nbecause of \u2018the all too familiar conflict between work time and time for family . . .\n[but because] . . . the qualities of good work are not the qualities of good character\u2019\n(1998: 21). His implication is that the changing nature of the work ethic puts new\npressures on the nature of our caring relationships. Social policy has long played\na critical role in mitigating the corrosive effects of the wage labour process, while\nalso perpetuating particular forms of (patriarchal) household and shaping the\nrelationship between work and home (Pascall, 1986). The debate about work\u2013\nlife balance encapsulates the ways in which these aspects of social policy are\nchanging. This is about more than the direct regulation of terms and conditions of\nemployment. At issue are the boundaries between the market and the household\nin terms of sources of income on the one hand and sources of care on the\nother.\ntipping the balance 523\nExisting research would indicate clearly enough that household strategies\nare evolving to adapt to more flexible working patterns (Harkness, 2003) and\nthat generally both employers and employees are supportive of work\u2013life balance\ninitiatives ((Hogarth et al., 2003). In practice, however, there are indications that\nawareness of provision to facilitate work\u2013life balance among employees and the\nwillingness of employers to implement such provision remains inconsistent and\noften constrained (for example,Yeandle et al., 2002). Noticeably, while employers\nmay be willing to accommodate flexible working hours and pay generous\nchildcare subsidies in the case of highly valued and highly productive technical\nand managerial staff, such policies do not necessarily apply to low-skilled and\nessentially expendable workers at operational or local branch levels (Dean and\nShah, 2002; Hyman et al., 2005).\nThat work\u2013life balance is a matter of bargaining power has been\nacknowledged, for example, in a summary report upon the Joseph Rowntree\nFoundation\u2019s extensive Work and Family Life Programme, though the research\nfunded under that programme did not specifically focus on low-income\nhouseholds (Dex, 2003: 73). The study reported in this article, in contrast,\nwas concerned with the experiences and expectations of work\u2013life balance in\na low-income neighbourhood. It sought to investigate local perceptions of the\ntriumvirate of policy initiatives referred to above. In the prevailing climate, what\neffects might the pressure on working parents to engage with the labour market\nseem to be having on power relations between employers and employees at a\nlocal level? Can low-paid jobs, subvented by tax credits, effectively meet local\naspirations and contribute to the regeneration of a low-income neighbourhood?\nWhen a more intensively commodified and professionalised nexus of childcare\nprovision is visited upon a neighbourhood, to what extent is this valued by\nworking parents?\nThe study1\nThe neighbourhood chosen for the study was centred on an inner-London\nhousing estate. In comparison to the national average, the estate had a relatively\nlow level of employment participation but a high proportion of households\nwith dependent children, and very high proportions of lone-parent households,\nhouseholds in social housing and Black\/minority ethnic households. The\nneighbourhood has been the focus of several urban regeneration initiatives,\nincluding a Sure Start project. The aim had been to explore what residents\nunderstood by, or expected from, \u2018work\u2013life balance\u2019 and whether they could\nsubstantively identify what might make for a better work\u2013life balance.\nThe study entailed in-depth interviews with 42 economically active working-\nage parents: 35 women and seven men. It was decided that the sample\nshould include a small number of men: while the work\u2013life balance agenda\nhas greater immediate salience for mothers than for fathers, key aspects of\n524 hartley dean\nthe gender dimension can only be explored by considering men\u2019s as well as\nwomen\u2019s understandings and experiences. The sample also included a small\nnumber of participants (six) who were currently unemployed but who had past\nexperience within the labour market and were currently seeking employment.\nTwo participants described themselves as disabled, ten had children whom they\ndescribed as disabled, and two were additionally caring for disabled adult relatives.\nThe sample was evenly divided between partnered parents and lone parents. A\nmajority of the sample were from Black or minority ethnic backgrounds. Most\nparticipants were on relatively low original incomes and, after housing and debt-\nservicing costs, it was clear that none enjoyed anything better than a modest\nincome. The participants\u2019 families ranged in size and age composition, but most\nincluded two or more children, and one third had at least one child under\nschool age. The interviews sought to explore the participants\u2019 experiences of\neducation, work, benefits (including tax credits), childcare provision and other\npolicy measures, but also their views on the importance and effectiveness of the\nfacilities and services currently at their disposal.\nParticipants supported the idea of work\u2013life balance but found it difficult\nto achieve. Stress and long hours were unavoidable in some jobs, or else\nincome and prospects had to be forgone in order to obtain \u2018family-friendly\u2019\nworking conditions. Employment rights were poorly understood. Standards of\nmanagement at work were inconsistent. Pay levels were thought to be insufficient\nand, though benefits\/tax credits helped, they were regarded as impenetrably\ncomplex and badly administered. Childcare provision was certainly available,\nbut quality and access were uneven. It emerged very clearly that what people\nin this neighbourhood wanted was more jobs, better managers, more accessible\nchildcare (especially in the early morning and during school holidays), more\nefficient benefits\/tax credit administration, and more extensive and effective\nadvice and information provision.\nIn several respects the tensions experienced by working parents in this low-\nincome neighbourhood would not appear to have been so very different from, for\nexample, the \u2018broadly middle-income 1.5-earner households\u2019 (Dex, 2003: 76) who\nhave tended to predominate in recent discussions of work\u2013life balance. However,\nthis study sought to focus on a social ecological context that featured a three-way\ntension between a polarised inner-London labour market (for example, Hamnett,\n2002), a highly complex system of income maintenance and a fragmented and\nevolving nexus of childcare provision. Work\u2013life balance was seldom experienced\nas a comfortable state of equilibrium so much as a way of managing a variety of\nintersecting tensions.\nSystematic analysis of the interview transcripts suggested that participants\nhad offered four broad kinds of account or narrative depending, first, on whether\nthey described a situation in which they were adjusting their life to fit in with\ntheir work or their work to fit in with their life; and, second, whether they seemed\ntipping the balance 525\nto be happy (or at least reasonably content) or unhappy (or perhaps ambivalent)\nabout their situation. It is not suggested that there were four different kinds of\nparticipant, but four different kinds of story to be told about work\u2013life balance\nin this particular neighbourhood. These corresponded to what might be called\nthe \u2018guilty worker\u2019 scenario, the \u2018reluctant carer\u2019 scenario, the \u2018grateful worker\u2019\nscenario and the \u2018lucky carer\u2019 scenario. Nor is it suggested that the narratives for\neach scenario are exactly the same, because they were not. Nonetheless:\n\u2022 In the guilty worker scenario, work\u2013life balance was not working for people.\nThey were needing to put work before family and they felt unhappy about\nit. Seventeen of the 42 participants described such a scenario (15 women and\ntwo men). Some participants expressed forthright dissatisfaction with their\nemployers\u2019 failure to accommodate their needs. Others gave more ambiguous\nanswers, but clearly were struggling to give priority to family life in the way\nthey would have wanted.\n\u2022 In the reluctant carer scenario, people were needing to care for their families\nwhen they would have preferred to put more into their work. Six participants\ndescribed this scenario (five women and one man), all of whom were currently\nin search of employment.\n\u2022 In the grateful worker scenario, people were putting work before family\nbut they were grateful for the opportunity to work. Eight participants\ndescribed this scenario. Half of these were fathers, none of whom were\nprimary carers. The others were mothers, two of whom had gladly returned\nto paid employment in middle age when their caring responsibilities were\nsignificantly reduced. The other two seemed especially deferent towards their\nemployers and represented perhaps the only exemplars in this particular study\nof what Hakim (1991) once described as the \u2018grateful slave\u2019 syndrome.\n\u2022 In the lucky carer scenario, people were putting family before work and felt\nlucky that they were able to do so. Work\u2013life balance was working for them,\nbut they had achieved this as a matter of serendipity or chance, or because,\nfortunately, they felt able to forgo income and\/or career opportunities. Eleven\nparticipants described this scenario. All were women. Some of these women\nwere themselves working as childminders or as foster parents. The others\nwere either working under especially exemplary managers or were working\nvery short part-time hours.\nThis is, of course, a model intended for only heuristic purposes. It was\nrecognised that experiences of the participants were changing and complex. At a\nsubsequent feedback meeting held on the estate, several participants emphasised\nthat much depended on the stage people were at in their lifecourse and on the\nages of their children. It also emerged that there could be different interpretations\nfor each scenario. While the guilty worker scenario was widely recognised and\nreflected a stage through which many participants felt they had gone, some\n526 hartley dean\nof the others were potentially ambiguous. The nature of the luck entailed in\nbeing a lucky carer would not necessarily be obvious at the time. The gratitude\nentailed in being a grateful worker might not stem from submissive satisfaction\nwith one\u2019s employer, but from satisfaction with one\u2019s own achievements: people\nmay be grateful for the chance to work even when they feel (or know) they are\nbeing exploited. Nonetheless, the model provoked lively discussion and it was\nagreed that it did capture something about the nature of work\u2013life balance issues\naffecting the residents of the estate.\nOne important observation to be drawn from these qualitative data is that\na majority of the economically active working-age parents in a sample drawn\nfrom a low-income neighbourhood were not wholly content with the work\u2013\nlife balance they had achieved under their current working arrangements. This\ncontrasts with findings from a telephone interview survey conducted on behalf of\nthe UK government which claim that 87 per cent of British workers are satisfied\nwith their working arrangements (Hooker et al., 2006).\nMore interestingly, perhaps, a majority of the participants in this study were\npolarised between those currently experiencing a guilty worker scenario and\nthose experiencing a lucky carer scenario. Considering that in this instance none\nof the reluctant carers was currently employed and all but two of the grateful\nworkers currently had relatively limited parental responsibilities, it is arguably\nthe guilty worker and lucky carer scenarios that have the greatest salience for our\nunderstanding of work\u2013life balance. In various ways, those experiencing these\nparticular scenarios were subject not just to lack of opportunity, but a lack of\ncontrol over their work\u2013life balance. Guilty workers could not get what they\nwanted, while lucky carers got it just by chance or good fortune.\nPowerlessness and (un)predictability\nThis leads us to consider the general powerlessness that may afflict workers and\nthe unpredictability of the economic and social environment in which they must\nnegotiate their work\u2013life balance. In the study described this was evident, first, in\nrelation to the participants\u2019 experiences of management practices and, second,\nin relation to their lack of knowledge and understanding.\nWe have already observed that standards of management among the\nparticipants\u2019 employers were variable. Reflecting the peculiarities of the local\nlabour market, two-thirds of the participants currently in employment worked\neither in the public or the voluntary\/community sectors, and the other third\nin the private sector. It became evident that variations in management practice\nwere quite considerable: not just between employers but even between different\ndepartments within the same employing organisation (cf. Bond et al., 2002).\nParticipants needed their bosses to be flexible so as to accommodate the often\ncomplex routines associated with childcare arrangements or the unexpected\ntipping the balance 527\ndemands associated with children\u2019s illnesses. What made a difference so far as\nthe participants were concerned were not simply the policies officially subscribed\nto by their employers but the degree of \u2018understanding\u2019 exhibited by their line\nmanagers. Such understanding was not something that could be relied upon,\nalthough several participants suggested that much depended on whether their\nmanagers had had experience of bringing up children themselves. The difference\nbetween lucky carer and guilty worker scenarios depended in several instances on\nthe degree of understanding demonstrated by line managers. It was clear that the\nculture in some employing organisations and the attitude of line managers could\nbe conducive to a satisfactory work\u2013life balance, but such experiences were not\nthe norm. Some managers could be insensitive or even bullying, especially when\nworkers needed time off work because of their own or their children\u2019s sickness.\nOf particular concern, however, were employers \u2013 particularly public and\nvoluntary\/community sector employers \u2013 who subscribed to work\u2013life balance\nideals in principle, but whose ethos at the everyday operational level demanded\nmaximum personal commitment. Participants were often contractually entitled\nto flexibility in their working hours, but found it extremely difficult or were made\nto feel guilty when, for example, they sought legitimately to take time off in lieu\nof contractual hours already worked. The two male participants who described\n\u2018guilty worker scenarios\u2019, although neither was currently a primary carer, both\nregretted the long hours they felt obliged to work because of the lack of time they\nspent with their children. The long hours worked by some participants did not\nalways result from the Gradgrind attitudes of employers, so much as more subtle\npressures and a sometimes unthinking hypocrisy on the part of managers.\nCompounding the problem of inconsistent employer practices was the\nparticipants\u2019 own uncertainty about the nature and extent of their employment\nrights. Most were vaguely aware of, or had at least heard about, rights to maternity\nand even paternity leave, although few had any idea as to the specific details or\nconditions attaching to such rights. Few were aware of their (somewhat tenuous)\nstatutory rights to parental leave or to request flexible working, although those\nwho had been able to exercise such rights \u2013 sometimes without any understanding\nas to their statutory basis \u2013 clearly valued them. The few who were at least partially\naware of their rights would often lack the confidence to ask for them, since they\nhad no expectation that their requests would be acted upon or because they felt\nvulnerable. Some participants were trade union members but none appeared to\nhave received any clear advice or support from their trade union in relation to\nwork\u2013life balance issues.\nIf the participants\u2019 lack of awareness of their employment rights was\nworrying, their lack of awareness as to their rights to income maintenance through\nthe social security and tax credit system was alarming. All the participants (or\ntheir partners) were receiving the universal child benefit (or, as some still call\nit, \u2018family allowance\u2019). Most were receiving some other form of means-tested\n528 hartley dean\nincome maintenance, although some who clearly were entitled to additional\nassistance \u2013 for example, through the child tax credit \u2013 were not claiming it,\nsometimes through ignorance and sometimes through choice. Most of those who\nhad claimed the new child and working tax credits had had adverse experiences,\noften entailing overpayment and subsequent recovery proceedings. Many had at\nsome stage in their lives had adverse experiences claiming other benefits, such as\njobseeker\u2019s allowance or income support, and almost all expressed uncertainty, if\nnot bafflement, as to the basis on which they should or should not be entitled, for\nexample, to means-tested housing benefit and council tax benefit. So particularly\nlacking in transparency is the new tax credit system that the only participant\ntruly to understand it happened herself to be a welfare rights adviser. Several\nparticipants acknowledged that they \u2018didn\u2019t have a clue\u2019 as to whether they were\nreceiving everything they were entitled to.\nBenefits systems are designed increasingly to tailor support to meet diverse\nindividual needs. The UK government claimed when it introduced the tax credit\nsystem to be creating a \u2018seamless\u2019 system of support for families with children\n(HM Treasury, 2002), but while universal child benefit appears to provide a\nseamless (if skimpy) undergarment to which the participants were comfortably\ninured, the tax credit scheme was worn as a strange and clumsy outer garment\nthat, while essential to many households, had been rejected by some because of\nthe risk of overpayment and the fear that it might at any moment be snatched\naway.\nThe particular neighbourhood in which the study was conducted was not\nespecially well served by advice and information facilities. The nearest Citizens\u2019\nAdvice Bureau, which was generally much respected by the participants, was some\ndistance away and could only be accessed by appointment or, in an emergency, by\nbeing prepared to queue. Several of the lone parents in the sample had benefited\nfrom advice and support from Job Centre personal advisers. The neighbourhood\nitself boasted a \u2018One Stop Shop\u2019 offering periodic advice sessions provided by\nvisiting staff from a variety of official agencies, but this was not well used by\nresidents. Participants tended to rely on information direct from official agencies \u2013\noften from the internet \u2013 when they had problems. It seemed, however, that if the\nresidents of this neighbourhood were to begin to believe in their rights at work\nand their entitlements to benefits or tax credits, large quantities of indigestible\ninformation would not be enough. People\u2019s rights need to be simpler. Or when\nrights cannot be made simple, people need sources of information and advice\nthey can trust and they need advocates who can effectively champion their rights.\nOne final aspect of the participants\u2019 powerlessness is that there was no\napparent sense in which they shared or held their labour market experiences in\ncommon. Very few participants had anything but the vaguest idea about where\ntheir neighbours or other members of the community might be working. This\nis without doubt at least partly because of the nature of the labour market in an\ntipping the balance 529\ninner-London neighbourhood, since this will inevitably be more metropolitan\nthan \u2018local\u2019 in any conventional sense. The scale and volatility of such a labour\nmarket make it inherently unpredictable. While there was a certain sense of\ncommunity on the estate, with a clear majority expressing themselves to be\nhappy living there and many reporting engagement in voluntary activities on the\nestate, there was no awareness among the participants of where the economic\nfoundations of that community might be located. Work\u2013life balance requires\nthat jobs should, so far as possible, be stable and that employment standards are\nconsistent. There needs to be some shared sense in place and time that certain\nemployment norms and practices are customary and a legitimate expectation.\nThis is difficult to achieve in an inner-urban environment, especially if the jobs\ncreated \u2013 for example, by regeneration funding \u2013 tend to be neither permanent\nnor expertly managed.\nIf work\u2013life balance principles are to become universally applicable,\nemployment practices need to be more consistent, vulnerable workers must\nbe afforded the means to exercise their rights and labour markets have to be more\nstable.\nCalibration and (in)calculability\nThis raises deeper questions concerning the fundamental ambiguity of current\npolicy objectives and the extent to which the boundaries between labour market\nand household may be shifting. The calculations that workers must make are not\nmerely complex, they are contestable.\nWork\u2013life balance appears to have been absorbed into the \u2018Third Way\u2019\nsocial policy orthodoxy whose hegemonic influence reaches beyond the sphere of\nliberal\/Anglophone welfare regimes to Europe and beyond (Bonoli and Powell,\n2002; Deacon, 2003). The orthodoxy rests not so much on a facile compromise\nbetween New Right and Old Left as an inherent tension between competing\nnotions of individual responsibility in relation to work and family respectively.\nPreoccupations with responsibility began with neo-conservative scepticism\ntowards the \u2018demoralising\u2019 effects of the classic welfare state (Himmelfarb, 1995),\nbut took an additional turn when champions of the new modernity began\nto argue that the role of the state was not passively to protect its citizens by\npandering to their needs, but actively to enable them to manage their own risks\nand provide for themselves (Giddens, 1994, 1998). The result is a policy agenda that\ncombines \u2018new paternalism\u2019 (Mead, 1997) with \u2018advanced liberalism\u2019 (Rose, 1999).\nNew paternalism is characterised by more or less aggressive workfare policies\n(L\u00f8demel and Trickey, 2000) and, more generally, the \u2018creeping conditionality\u2019\nthat attaches to the administration of social welfare provision (Dwyer, 2004).\nAdvanced liberalism embraces a consumerist rather than a public service ethic\n(Le Grand, 2003) and aims to promote self-provisioning, prudentialism and an\n530 hartley dean\nindividualistic ethic of self-responsibility (Burchell, 1996). Social policies may\ncontradictorily encompass, on the one hand, a moral authoritarian insistence\nthat able-bodied adults should be forced into work, however menial, while\nparents should be made to control the behaviour of their children; and, on\nthe other, an ethical-individualist insistence that people should be enabled to\nenhance their human capital, while parents should be encouraged to promote\ntheir children\u2019s self-development. A study of recent trends in family law in the\nUS and Britain draws attention to the \u2018contrast between endeavours to determine\nwhat institutions required of individuals [and] the multitude of ways of trying to\nmake individuals act in a \u201cresponsible\u201d way towards those with respect to whom\nthey appear to have special responsibility\u2019 (Eekelaar, 2003: 117).\nWork\u2013life balance sits at the heart of this nexus of contradictions because\nworking parents are required to be individually responsible for providing for\nthemselves and their families and for bringing up their children, and yet many\nparents must depend on state subvention and institutionally regulated forms\nof childcare in order to do so. Legislating for work\u2013life balance has entailed\nshifts in the \u2018calibration\u2019 (Pierson, 1996) of policy instruments, but this in turn\nentails shifts of locus so far as the calculations that working parents must make.\nDividing lines between market income and state income, between childcare and\nchild development, between personal aspiration and social obligation become,\nif not blurred, then increasingly fluid. This was amply illustrated in the study\noutlined above.\nWe have already observed that policies to promote childcare provision may\nreflect competing objectives: promoting parental employment on the one hand\nand enhancing child development on the other (see also Huston, 2004). There\nwas a confusing variety of childcare options in the neighbourhood studied.\nParticipants did not always find them accessible or affordable, and feelings about\nthe standards of provision were mixed. There was a government-sponsored Sure\nStart project on the estate (providing, inter alia, childcare and parenting training),\nand a range of childminders, nurseries (including privately run nurseries), after-\nschool clubs and holiday play schemes. Despite this, the most commonly used\nand the most valued form of childcare was informal care from family and friends.\nFormal childcare provision was not meeting the needs of every parent. The\nUK government seeks to promote choice and diversity in childcare (Department\nfor Education and Employment, 1998), but what seemed to matter most to\nparticipants was that childcare should be generally available and wholly reliable.\nSuch findings are consonant with those of other researchers in demonstrating\nthat organising childcare is time-consuming and stressful for parents (Wheelock\nand Jones, 2002). Working parents are not only grappling with practical issues\nof affordability and accessibility, but with moral considerations about what is\nright for their children (Duncan and Irwin, 2004). There were competing views\nabout what constitutes \u2018good-quality\u2019 childcare. Different parents had different\ntipping the balance 531\npriorities with regard to provision for children\u2019s emotional needs on the one hand,\nor their developmental needs on the other. It was clear that, for many, informal\n(that is, \u2018unregistered\u2019) childcare was and would remain a critical and valued part\nof their coping strategy. Where formal childcare provision is available, parents\nseek certainty as much as choice. The fluidity and perceived impermanence of\nformal childcare arrangements on the estate were problematic and undermined\npeople\u2019s confidence in what was available. Some childcare providers were regarded\nnot just as expensive but as exploitative.\nIn so far as childcare was a contested issue as far as parents were concerned,\nthis was rooted in an awareness that policy and practice in relation to childcare\nwere changing. This was most clearly illustrated by one of the older members\nof the sample, who herself worked as a registered childminder and part-time\nplayworker (while also providing unpaid childcare for her grandchildren). She\nwas able to look back on the time before childcare was formally regulated, when\nshe had combined paid childcare work with caring for her own children. Asked\nhow she managed in those days, she said \u2018No idea. It just all flowed.\u2019 The new\nregime, calculated to facilitate work\u2013life balance, had reconstituted her role: not\nonly because she had been required to undertake \u2018silly little bits and pieces\u2019 of\ntraining, but because she found:\nSure Start called me a \u2018service provider\u2019, and I\u2019m like \u2013 \u2018what are you talking about?\u2019 . . . anything\nI do I don\u2019t see it as \u2013 that I\u2019m a professional doing something. I just don\u2019t. I do it for the children.\nI don\u2019t see it as that. But yes, I am. And I\u2019ve kind of adapted a little bit to it. But no, I still don\u2019t\nsee it when they say it.\nAn informal economy of childcare on the estate is giving way to a\ncommodified nexus of provision. Ambivalence towards the formalisation of\nchildcare did not necessarily stem from mere nostalgia but could spill over into\nsometimes quite bitter resentment towards the particular approach fostered by\nSure Start, which was attacked by some participants for being, paradoxically,\nexclusive. One participant accused Sure Start of promoting \u2018middle-class\u2019\nparenting values, while neglecting the needs of the very poorest parents on the\nestate: an observation that has at least passing resonance with formal evaluations\nof Sure Start (National Evaluation of Sure Start, 2005).\nThe formalisation of childcare has coincided with the explicit promotion of\nwork\u2013life balance. Childcare is now a calculable component of the relationship\nbetween labour market activity and the household economy. Historically\nspeaking, moral obligations within households have been socially negotiated\nin spite rather than because of social policy interventions (Finch, 1989). Recent\nevidence concerning the decision making of lone parents has demonstrated that\nthis is informed as much by moral rationality as by economic utility (Duncan and\nEdwards, 1999). And yet parents in the study described above demonstrated the\nway in which calculative processes could now extend across boundaries between\n532 hartley dean\nthe labour market and the household. The difficulties of negotiating a change in\nhousehold strategy were illustrated by one lone parent with two children aged\ntwo and 11. She had been prepared in the past to \u2018go into some menial job just to\nput some change on the table\u2019, but then three years ago chose to \u2018have time out\nto be with the kids\u2019. Her \u2018time out [had] now run out\u2019 and, despite help from the\nJob Centre, she was struggling to find a suitable job again:\nbut when you have [to work] bank holidays and you have shifts when you\u2019re coming home at\nquarter to seven in the evening \u2013 that\u2019s not what I call a job. That\u2019s what I call working me down\nto the ground and I\u2019m not doing it . . . I was thrown into an interview saying it was only 20\nhours or 22 hours a week . . .Twenty minutes later got a \u2019phone call saying I got the job. When I\nwas told the shift patterns . . . I baffled my brains. Me and my [11 year old] son\u2019s worked it out\nand I thought \u2013 I can\u2019t do this shift. I can\u2019t do it. I went to the nursery and they said they can\u2019t\ncover that . . . That means I\u2019ve got to get up, go out, come back, cook, then leave again. Can\u2019t\ndo it . . . I spent a whole two days trying to get it sussed out.\nThe negotiation she had unsuccessfully attempted involved employers, her\nchildcare providers and even one of her own children. While some participants\nstruggled with the incalculability of work\u2013life balance equations, others had\nclearly learned, after a fashion, to cope with them. This was expressed by an\narticulate lone parent, now working for a local authority, who had four children\naged between one and 15. Asked whether she had thought about requesting\nreduced hours when returning to work after the birth of one of her older children,\nshe acknowledged that \u2018It really didn\u2019t enter my mind at that time. I think, being\na single mum, hoping that things will work out, you know.\u2019 Following the birth\nof her latest child, however, she had negotiated reduced hours. She remained\nmindful on the one hand that she was being materially undervalued: \u2018at the\nend of the day, in truth, financially it really isn\u2019t worth stepping out of your\nhouse because you\u2019re working for the nursery, childminder [or] whatever child\nprovision you\u2019re using. That\u2019s what you\u2019re working for \u2013 and your rent.\u2019 But\non the other hand, she partly welcomed the driving force behind the work\u2013life\nbalance agenda: that employers and the government recognised the kind of skills\nshe had as a mother and were seeking deliberately to harness them:\nI\u2019ve got how many children that I\u2019ve got to get ready . . . it\u2019s about organisation; organisation\nskills and how do people account for their time. Where a lot of people think \u2013 that\u2019s why mums\ncan go into management, or should be able to walk straight into work management because\nthey do the budgeting, they do the . . . [mimes frenetic activity]. But [other] mums don\u2019t see it\nin that context: a skill that they can transfer into the workplace. And it\u2019s about confidence.\nOther participants related accounts of what US commentators have called\n\u2018tag-team parenting\u2019 (Presser, 2004), whereby two-parent households mutually\nnegotiate their working shifts so that one of them will be available to care\nfor the children. There were, similarly, accounts of how the complex transport\ntipping the balance 533\nlogistics, sometimes associated with childcare arrangements, had to be factored\ninto parents\u2019 calculations (cf. Skinner, 2005).\nOverwhelmingly, participants wanted to work. Some rejoiced in the work\nthey were doing. Repeatedly, however, they would utter variations on the mantra:\n\u2018my children come first\u2019. And yet the scenarios they presented so often entailed\ntrade-offs between flexibility and function: trade-offs that \u2018spilled-over\u2019 (Hyman\net al., 2005) or encroached not on the nature of their work, but the substance of\ntheir family life.\nConclusion\nA significant implication is that there can be no single or simple policy solution\nto the diverse needs and aspirations signified by the different scenarios identified\nin the study described above. Under the UK\u2019s prevailing policy regime, work\u2013life\nbalance is achievable only for some. As workers, the participants were ultimately\npowerless to control their work\u2013life balance. As parents and carers, they appeared\nto be struggling with newly constituted calculative responsibilities. Once pressed\nto calculate, what has been described as a guilty worker scenario is one in which\nworking parents feel they have miscalculated; the reluctant carer scenario is one\nin which they are still struggling to achieve a satisfactory calculation; the grateful\nworker scenario is one in which they make to the best of the calculation they\nmanaged to come up with; the lucky carer scenario is one in which they land,\nmore or less, on their feet without much calculation.\nThe issue of work\u2013life balance can be presented simplistically as a contest\nbetween what Bloom et al. (2006) have called the \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 theory and the\n\u2018Chirac\u2019 theory: the former \u2013 which they attribute to the UK New Labour\ngovernment \u2013 argues the business case for work\u2013life balance, holding that it can\nincrease productivity in a global free market; the latter \u2013 which they attribute to\nthe European social model \u2013 argues that measures to promote work\u2013life balance,\neven if they reduce productivity, represent a cost that should be borne in order\nto ameliorate the consequences of rampant economic competition. The \u2018win\u2013\nwin\u2019 or business case theory holds that flexible managers who accommodate\nworkers\u2019 needs will get better results. However, evidence for the productivity\ngains to be had from family-friendly employment policies is complex and, at\nbest, only modestly supportive (Dex and Smith, 2002). Bloom et al.\u2019s analysis,\nbased on quantitative data, suggests that while good management does indeed\nlead to better work\u2013life balance outcomes, work\u2013life balance does not of itself\nenhance productivity. But they also demonstrate that, subject to the quality\nof management, neither does work\u2013life balance harm productivity, so neither\nthe \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 nor the \u2018Chirac\u2019 theory is completely right. On the basis of the\nqualitative\/narrative data from the study outlined above, it may be argued that\nwork\u2013life balance would be best promoted as a part of the social responsibility\n534 hartley dean\nagenda, and not on the basis of the business case. In some instances, it was plain\nthat the business case would be tenuous or non-existent. The skills and family\ncircumstances of some participants were frankly such that if really suitable spaces\nwere to be found for them in the labour market, the culture and dynamics of\nthe work place might have to change in ways that would not provide short-term\nbenefits for employers. This is a suggestion that resonates with related arguments\nabout the desirability of a \u2018life-first\u2019 approach to welfare-to-work (see Dean,\n2003) or a \u2018welfare-in-work\u2019 approach (Ridge and Millar, 2006). People should\nbe enabled to work because, by and large, they need to do so: it is constitutive\nof our \u2018species being\u2019 (Marx, 1844: 328). But they also need to sustain and to be\nsustained by caring relationships.\nThere are issues here to be raised with employers\u2019 organisations, especially\nthose who espouse the cause of corporate responsibility, and trade unions, whose\npractical performance appears from the study outlined to be disappointing. But\nthe implications, perhaps, go beyond a \u2018Chirac\u2019 style call for social partnership.\nWork\u2013life balance remains a profoundly gendered issue. Jane Lewis has\nargued that rising levels of female labour force participation do not necessarily\nsignal gender equality if women are being drawn into the labour market on men\u2019s\nterms. The discredited male breadwinner household model may increasingly be\nsuperseded by the \u2018adult worker model\u2019, yet the new model is premised on an\nessentially masculine understanding of the labour process (Lewis, 2002). It is\nwomen\u2019s behaviour and assumptions that are changing \u2013 far more than those\nof men (for example, Dermott, 2006). The findings from the study reported\nabove suggest that feminising the management of employment might help to\nenhance workers\u2019 experience of work\u2013life balance: the best managers, it seems,\nare those with first-hand experience of parenthood in general and motherhood\nin particular. Feminist theorists have lately argued for policy approaches that\nare concerned less with the fostering of a work ethic, and more with an\nethic of care (Sevenhuijssen, 2000). Fiona Williams (2001) has suggested that\nthe idea of work\u2013life balance provides an opening for such a re-evaluation.\nThis requires more than the feminising of management, since it goes to the\nquestion of responsibility and the need for an understanding of collective and\nindividual responsibilities that is more \u2018balanced\u2019 and holistic than that offered\nby either the new paternalism or advanced liberalism. This requires what might\nbe regarded as more of a \u2018paradigm shift\u2019 (Hall, 1993) than a recalibration of\npolicy.\nIn the meantime, there is a case for seeking to tip the work\u2013life balance scales\nin favour of workers rather than employers; caring responsibilities rather than\nproductivity; and low-income groups rather than higher-earners. This would\nimply, wherever possible, an emphasis on the effective regulation of employers,\na preference for universal forms of income maintenance and an insistence on\nreliable childcare provision.\ntipping the balance 535\nNote\n1 The study was funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council under Award Ref:\nRES-000\u201322-1491.
