Introduction \n \nSmall world phenomenon is the hypothesis that \neveryone in the world can be reached through a short \nchain of social acquaintances [1]. Small-world \nphenomena [1] have also been observed in existing peer-\nto-peer (P2P) networks, such as Gnutella and Freenet [2]. \nDuncan Watts proposed a mathematical model [3] to \nanalyze the small world phenomenon with highly \nclustered sub-networks consisting of local nodes and \nrandom long-range shortcuts that help produce short paths \nto remote nodes. Due to the similarity between P2P \nnetworks and social networks, where peer nodes are \npeople and connections are relationships, Duncan\u2019s theory \ncan potentially be adopted in P2P networks: each peer \nnode is connected to some neighbouring nodes on the P2P \ntopology, and a group of peer nodes keep a small number \nof long links to randomly chosen distant peer nodes. \nHowever, current unstructured search algorithms have \ndifficulty distinguishing among such random long-range \nshortcuts and finding proper shortcuts for a specific \nresource search. \nThis paper presents small world architecture for P2P \nnetworks (SWAN) for content discovery in multi-group \nP2P systems. A semi-structured P2P algorithm of SWAN \nis used to create and discover long-range shortcuts \nbetween different peer groups, which can satisfy the \nfollowing requirements of design:  \n\u2022 Not every peer node needs to connect to other groups;  \n\u2022 Each peer node needs to know or can easily find which \nnodes have external connections to which peer groups;  \n\u2022 External links to other peer groups need to be \ndistributed within the peer group and cannot be \ncentralized in one or a few peer nodes. \nExisting P2P solutions for resource discovery can be \ngenerally classified into two categories: structured and \nunstructured P2P systems. An observed issue of most \nDHTs is that the cost of maintaining a consistent \ndistributed index is too high in the dynamic Internet \nenvironment [4, 5]. Some structured P2P protocols (e.g. \nKademlia [6]) are beginning to seek ways to save the cost \nof maintaining a consistent index. In contrast, \nunstructured P2P systems (e.g. Gnutella) do not control \ndata placement and are more resilient in dynamic \nenvironments, but current unstructured P2P search \ntechniques tend to either require high search overhead or \ngenerate massive network traffic. To address these \nproblems, a semi-structured P2P search method is \npresented in this paper combining techniques of both \nstructured and unstructured methods. The search \nalgorithm of SWAN does not strictly rely on DHTs which \ncan still find the requested data inside and outside of peer \ngroups with a high probability even though hash functions \ncan not provide accurate information of data locations.  \n \n2. Related Work \n  \nMaintaining and searching \u201csmall world\u201d has been \ndiscussed in recent P2P studies. Jon Kleinberg discussed \nthe problem of decentralized search in P2P networks with \npartial information about the underlying structure in [7]. \nA study in [8] proposes an enhanced clustering cache \nreplacement scheme for Freenet by forcing the routing \ntables to resemble neighbour relationships in a small-\nworld acquaintance graph. Semantic Small World in [9] \nfacilitates efficient semantic based search in P2P systems \nwhere peers are clustered according to the semantics of \ntheir local data and self-organized as a small world \nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Conference on\nWeb Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2006 Workshops)(WI-IATW'06)\n0-7695-2749-3\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\noverlay network. Despite the fact that unstructured P2P \nare more resilient in dynamic environments, the efficiency \nof these unstructured P2P approaches is still far lower \nthan DHTs. Hierarchical SRDI service of JXTA [10] \nattempts to use combined techniques with both structured \nand unstructured search methods. However, it encounters \nthe performance bottleneck of centralized super-peers and \nmaintenance of the distributed index is disordered and \nredundant. In contrast, our model is built upon a flat P2P \noverlay network, which is efficient and fault-tolerant for \ncontent discovery inside or outside of peer group. \n \n3. Algorithm Description \n \nSWAN is built with the generic group structures \nsimilar to Jon Kleinberg\u2019s model [7]. The previous studies \nlike [11, 12, 13] have presented the methodologies of \nbuilding an information sharing system by grouping peer \nnodes that will not be discussed in this paper. This paper \nwill focus on data publishing and searching algorithms of \nSWAN with generic group structures. By using a compact \nrepresentation mechanism (e.g. Bloom Filters [14]), each \npeer node maintains an inconsistent list about members in \nthe same group and regards other members as \n\u201cacquaintances.\u201d A group of peer nodes keep a small \nnumber of long links to distant peer nodes. A semi-\nstructured approach is presented in this section to create \nlong-range links between groups as well as discover the \nlocal peer nodes that have specific external connections. \nAn example of SWAN topology is illustrated in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. Topology of SWAN. \n \n3.1. Intra-Group Content Searching \n \nEach shared file in SWAN is published by an \nassociated content advertisement that provides the \nrelevant meta-information of the file (e.g. name, node \naddress, description), which is pushed to a target peer \nnode according to the hash value of the name of file, as \nwell as internal neighbours of the target peer node in the \nmember list within a specific distance d to increase the \nprobability of discovery of the advertisement. The \nadvertisement searching process involves two steps: a \nstructured P2P search followed by an unstructured P2P \nsearch. The requesting peer node firstly searches the \ntarget peer nodes generated from the same hash function \n(structured P2P search) If the requested advertisement \ncannot be found in the target peer node (e.g. the target \npeer node is offline at the moment), the requesting peer \nnode will continue to search the neighbours of the target \npeer node in member list within distance d (unstructured \nP2P search) and can find the requested files with a high \nprobability. Figure 2 illustrates an example of content \nadvertisement publishing and searching. P1 shares a file \nwith the name K1. The publication service on peer P1 \npushes the associated advertisement of K1 to P4 \naccording to the hash value of K1 and the neighbours of \nP4 (P3 and P5) within the distance 1=d . Then other peer \nnodes in the same peer group can easily find the \nadvertisement in a high probability. In this case, P6 looks \nfor the advertisement by generating the same hash value \npointing to P4 with the same hash function and sends a \nquery to P4 and find the advertisement with K1 in P4. \nHowever, if the requested advertisement cannot be found \nin P4, the requesting peer node will continue to search P3 \nand P5 that are neighbours of P4 within distance 1=d . \nPublication and searching parameter d is defined based on \nusers\u2019 requirements and present rate of peer nodes. \nGenerally, a bigger d is required in a dynamic network \nwith a lower peer present rate. \n \nFigure 2. Advertisement publishing and searching. \n \n3.2. Inter-Group Content Searching \n \nIn SWAN, a new peer group is advertised by a group \nadvertisement that provides the relevant meta-information \nabout the peer group (e.g. ID, name, contact points, \ndescription), which will be multicast through network. \nNot all the peer nodes in the network will receive the \nadvertisement, but a large percentage of them will. When \na peer node receives a peer group advertisement, it will \npush the advertisement to a target peer node in the peer \ngroup according to the hash value of the name of the peer \ngroup as well as neighbours of the target peer node within \na specific distance d to increase probability of discovery \nof the advertisement. Similar to the intra-group content \nsearching, if the requesting node cannot find the requested \nadvertisement with the uniform hash function due to high \nnetwork churn, the requested advertisement will still be \nfound in the neighbours of the target peer node with a \nhigh probability by using unstructured P2P searching. \nTherefore, even though only one peer node is informed, \nall the peer nodes in the same peer group potentially can \nfind and pull the peer group advertisement. Figure 3 \nillustrates the process of inter-group link formation. When \nP1 receives a group advertisement about group G2 with \ncontact point P'3, it will push the advertisement to the \nProceedings of the 2006 IEEE\/WIC\/ACM International Conference on\nWeb Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2006 Workshops)(WI-IATW'06)\n0-7695-2749-3\/06 $20.00  \u00a9 2006\ntarget peer node P4 according to hash function as well as \nits neighbours (P3 and P5) within distance 1=d . Then \nP4 will inform a contact point of group G2: P'3 with the \nadvertisement of its peer group G1. When P'3 gets the \nadvertisement of G1, P'3 will do the same as P1 to \nforward the advertisement of G1 toward the target peer \nnode P'5 according to hash function as well as its \nneighbours within distance d. When P'5 receives the \nadvertisement, P'5 will do the same as P4 to send the \nadvertisement of its group G2 back to P4. When P4 \nreceives it and sends the acknowledgement of inter-group \nlink back to P'5, an inter-group link will be built between \nG1 and G2 and be maintained by P4 and P'5. In the same \nway, more inter-group links will be created and \nmaintained between P3, P4, P5 and P'4, P'5, P'6, in case \nof 1=d . Each of them normally keeps 3 (2d+1) inter-\ngroup links as illustrated in Figure 4 which makes groups \nconnected even in a highly dynamic environment. Inter-\ngroup search queries can be propagated toward the \nrequested peer group efficiently via inter-group links and \nrelevant shared files can be found with high probability. \nThe methods of resolving the pair of keyword of clusters \nand value of shared files have been discussed in [15] and \nwill not be described in detail in this paper. \n \nFigure 3. Inter-Peer group link formation. \n \n4. Performance Evaluation \n \nWe evaluated the effectiveness of SWAN in the \ndynamic environments with frequent peer nodes online \nand offline. In this section, we assume that the requested \nadvertisements have been published successfully to the \ntarget peer node as well as its neighbours within a \ndistance d. There are n peer nodes in the network, each \npeer node has k neighbours in each peer group, peer \ngroups do not overlap and are connected by inter-group \nlinks as shown in Figure 1. There are a total of k+1 peer \nnodes in each group. The success rate and cost of inter-\ngroup content searching will be evaluated with peer \npresent rate p.  \nIn SWAN, three conditions must be satisfied to find an \nadvertisement in a different group as shown in Figure 4: \n(1) Succeed in finding an advertisement about the \nrequested peer group on the searching peer node \nitself (case A) or on other members (case B). \n(2) Succeed in contacting the requested group (case C). \n(3) Succeed in finding a requested content advertisement \nin the requested peer group (case D). \n \nFigure 4. P2P searching in dynamic environments. \nThe probability of failing in finding an advertisement \nabout the requested peer group is: \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1212 1\n1\n21\n1\n121| ++ \u2212\n+\n\u2212\n=\u2212\u22c5\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\n+\n\u2212==\ndd p\nk\ndkp\nk\ndABPAPBAP \u222a  \nWe assume that queries will be forwarded to the \nrequested peer group if the peer nodes on both ends of the \ninter-group link are online. Recall that the local peer \ngroup keeps inter-group links toward 2d+1 peer nodes in \na remote peer group. The searching peer node will fail to \ncontact the requested peer group, if all 2d+1 peer nodes \nare all offline. Therefore, the probability of failing in \ncontacting the requested group is: ( ) ( ) 121| +\u2212= dpBACP \u222a . \nThe probability of finding an advertisement about the \nrequested group is ( )( ) ( ) 121\n1\n21| +\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212=\ndp\nk\ndkBACDP \u222a . \nThe success rate of finding a content advertisement in the \nrequested peer group is: \n( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( ) ( )BAPBACPBACDPBADCPPs \u222a\u222a\u222a\u222a \u22c5\u22c5== ||\n( ) ( )[ ]12212 111\n1\n21 ++ \u2212\u2212\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ee\n\u2212\u22c5\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212=\ndd pp\nk\ndk .

Simulation Results \n \nWe evaluated the performance of inter-group content \nsearching by simulation in dynamic environments. In the \nsimulation, we followed the same assumption presented in \nsection 4 that the requested advertisements had been \npublished successfully to the target peer node as well as \nits neighbours within a distance d. Therefore, if either the \ntarget peer node or one of its neighbours within distance d \nwas visited successfully, this search succeeded. In the \nsimulation, each peer group kept 500 peer nodes, all peer \nnodes in the same peer group were completely connected \nto each other, and all peer nodes were initialized as \npresent in the network. At the beginning of each search, a \nset of peer nodes were randomly selected and set as \nabsent according to the parameter of present rate of peer \nnodes, the searching peer node was randomly selected \nfrom the set of present peer nodes and the target peer \nnode with its neighbours were randomly selected from the \nset of peer nodes regardless of their present situation. In \neach data search, the searching peer node initials a query \nthat will be passed with the SWAN protocols. \n    The searching peer node and the target peer node were \nseparated into different groups in the simulation of inter-\ngroup content searching. Figure 5(b) and (c) show the \nresults of success rate and average number of messages of \neach query by the inter-group search (for 1000 queries), in \nwhich the theoretical results were generated from \nEquation (1), (2).  \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nPeer Present Rate\nSu\ncc\nes\ns \nRa\nte\nTheoretical results (d=1)\nSimulation results (d=1)\nTheoretical resuls (d=3)\nSimulation results (d=3)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nPeer Present Rate\nM\nes\nsa\nge\ns\nTheoretical reuslts (d-1)\nSimulation results (d=3)\nTheoretical results (d=1)\nSimulation results (d=3)\n \n    (a)     (b)            (c) \nFigure 5.

Conclusion \n \nThis paper presented small-world architecture for \ncontent discovery in unstructured P2P networks. In \nSWAN, each node is connected to neighbouring nodes in \nthe same peer group and peer groups are connected by a \nsmall number of inter-group links. Not every peer node \nneeds to be connected to remote groups, but every peer \nnode can easily find which peer nodes have external \nconnections to a specific peer group. A semi-structured \nP2P search method is presented in this paper combining \ntechniques of both structured and unstructured search \nmethods, which can discover the requested data with a \nhigh probability even though hash functions can not \nprovide accurate information of data locations. From the \nsimulation results, SWAN potentially has advantages of \nboth structured and unstructured P2P networks and \nachieved good performance in dynamic environments.  \n \nReferences \n \n[1] S.
