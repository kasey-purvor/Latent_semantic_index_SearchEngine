Although originally rooted in\nevolutionary biology, phenotypic plasticity is a broad, in-\nterdisciplinary topic, which lies at the intersection between\nmost of today\u2019s important biological disciplines (reviewed\nin Pigliucci 2001 and DeWitt and Scheiner 2004). Phe-\nnotypic plasticity occurs in traits ranging from morphol-\nogy to physiology and behavior and can be observed in\nnearly all classes of organisms (reviewed in Tollrian and\nHarvell 1999a). Understanding the selective advantage and\nthe limits of plasticity (i.e., why and how individual or-\nganisms respond to environmental change) is of critical\nimportance for numerous issues in ecology and evolution\n(Pigliucci 2001; Abrams and Matusda 2004; Vos et al.\n2004).\nTypes of phenotypic plasticity can differ a great deal in\ntheir relative speed and reversibility of change (see Tollrian\nand Dodson 1999). At one extreme, some plastic changes\nmight be relatively slow and irreversible. For example, in\nsystems with discrete polyphenisms (e.g., alternative mor-\nphotypes or castes), a single genotype can develop very\ndifferent morphologies depending on the environment\nduring development (e.g., Greene 1989). Once set during\ndevelopment, these basic morphotypes show little if any\nfurther plasticity. At the other extreme, behavioral changes\nare thought to be very rapid and infinitely reversible.\nMost plastic traits, however, fall somewhere in between\nthe two extremes of being irreversible or being instanta-\nneously reversible. For example, even though morpholog-\nical defenses are typically thought to be irreversible (e.g.,\nbent morphs in barnacles; Lively 1986), in some cases they\ncan be reversed during subsequent periods of growth. Cla-\ndocerans can reverse helmets, spines, or neckteeth with\nsubsequent molts (Tollrian 1993). With cell division, cil-\niates can reverse an induced winged morph back to a\ntypical morphed cell (Kuhlmann and Heckmann 1985;\nKuhlmann et al. 1999). Finally, predator-induced changes\n340 The American Naturalist\nin body or tail depth in fish or amphibian larvae are re-\nversible with further growth (Bro\u00a8nmark and Miner 1992;\nBro\u00a8nmark et al. 1999; Relyea 2003).\nLikewise, while behavioral responses are often rapid and\nhighly reversible, they can lag behind environmental\nchanges or have less than infinite reversibility. Time lags\nbetween environmental changes and when individuals re-\nspond behaviorally have long been noted (Tinbergen 1960;\nGetty and Krebs 1985; Sih 1992). The primary explanation\nfor these lags has been that individuals receive incomplete\ninformation about their environment, and thus it takes\ntime for them to detect environmental changes. In addi-\ntion, the reversibility of behavioral responses can be re-\nduced by earlier experiences that set behavioral tendencies\n(behavioral syndromes; Sih et al. 2004). For example, ex-\nperiences with danger can cause prey to be fearful (Boissy\n1995) and thus relatively inactive even at future times when\npredators are absent. These behavioral carryovers can re-\nflect relatively fixed physiological or morphological traits\nthat are set by early behaviors. For example, if prey reduce\ntheir activity and hide in refuge for long periods, they\nmight develop low metabolic rates or morphologies that\nmake them less well adapted for high activity later in life.\nInterestingly, although patterns of plasticity appear to\nshow a full range of degree of reversibility and speed of\nresponse, models of plasticity fall into two main camps\nthat consider the extremes of speed and inducibility of\nresponse (Sih 2004). The adaptive plasticity (AP) approach\nexamines irreversible, relatively slow responses to envi-\nronmental variation (Gabriel and Lynch 1992; Scheiner\n1993; Via et al. 1995), whereas the behavioral ecology (BE)\napproach looks primarily at rapid behavioral responses to\nvarying environments (Stephens 1987; Lima 1998). The\nBE approach in some cases has incorporated response lags\ndue to incomplete information (McNamara and Houston\n1980; Stephens and Krebs 1986; Luttbeg and Schmitz\n2000). However, these models have focused on the timing\nof behaviors rather than how time lags affect what be-\nhaviors individuals use. These different scenarios of re-\nversibility and the speed of responses have been addressed\nusing fundamentally different modeling approaches\n(quantitative genetics for AP vs. optimality theory for BE)\nthat can thus produce very different predictions about\nplasticity.\nGiven that phenotypic plasticity can show significant\nresponse lags and that induced traits can be reversible, we\nclearly need theory that addresses reversible plasticity with\nresponse lags (Piersma and Drent 2003). Not only would\nsuch theory apply to many organisms that do not fit ex-\nisting theory, but also it should provide a bridge between\nthe fields of behavioral ecology and adaptive phenotypic\nplasticity. Two previous models addressed reversible plas-\nticity with response lags. Padilla and Adolph (1996)\nshowed that a plastic strategy does poorly in comparison\nto fixed strategies if the time lag between the environment\nchanging and the individual responding is long relative to\nthe rate of environmental change. However, the compar-\nison was only between two specialist strategies optimized\nfor either of two environments and a generalist strategy\nthat switches between these specialist strategies. Gabriel\n(1999) assumed that reversible plasticity in trait values\nresults in fitness effects that can be described as reversible\nplastic changes in the mode and breadth of an environ-\nmental tolerance function induced by the environment.\n(Using a Gaussian fitness function, mean and standard\ndeviation correspond to mode and breadth.) In this model,\nunder a broad range of conditions, reversible plasticity was\nfavored over both no plasticity and irreversible plasticity.\nIn this model, however, the noninduced values of mode\nand breadth were not allowed to evolve but were kept\nfixed to the values of nonplastic genotypes. Under these\nconditions, plasticity in the breadth of adaptation seemed\nto be of minor importance. Gabriel (1999) did not con-\nsider temporal variation of the inducing environment nor\nthe reliability of the inducing cue, two components that\nmight be quite relevant for the understanding of the evo-\nlution of reversible plasticity.\nHere, we present three major extensions of the model\nof Gabriel (1999). First, the noninduced values of mode\nand breadth are no longer fixed to the values of nonplastic\ngenotypes, which allows concerted evolution of induced\nand noninduced values of mode and breadth. Second, tem-\nporal variation of the inducing environment is explicitly\nmodeled. Third, the reliability of the inducing cue is con-\nsidered for the two extreme cases of incomplete and com-\nplete information.\nWith this extended model, we explore how response\nlags, patterns of environmental variation, and information\navailable to organisms affect optimal patterns of reversible\nplasticity in terms of both the mean and breadth of tol-\nerance functions. Our model should be suitable for all\nkinds of reversible plasticity. However, to keep our dis-\ncussion from being too abstract, we focus on prey re-\nsponses to variations in predation risk, particularly on\ninducible defenses. Inducible defenses are widespread, with\nexamples from unicellular organisms to vertebrates (Toll-\nrian and Harvell 1999a; Relyea 2001). Predation risk is the\nvarying environmental state, and its impact on fitness is\ndescribed by a tolerance function. Prey exhibit a reversible\nplasticity where they can switch their phenotypes back and\nforth in response to the changes in predation risk. We\nexamine how time lags between changes in predation risk\nand the responses of prey affect the optimal mode and\nbreadth of their tolerance functions. We outline and de-\nscribe the results of a model of optimal patterns of re-\nversible prey plasticity, summarize our main predictions,\nReversible Plastic Responses 341\nand discuss the implications of our model for theoretical\nand empirical studies of plasticity.\nReversible Plasticity: Model Concept and Assumptions\nConsider first a simple, general scenario where predation\nrisk is the environmental gradient f with two main states:\na noninducing state and an inducing state. The nonin-\nducing state is when too few predators are present to evoke\na response from prey, and the inducing state is when\nenough predators are present to evoke a response. We\ndefine the state of the noninducing environment as 0.\n(Note that does not mean that the predation riskfp 0\nis 0, but it is low compared with induced states. Therefore,\nthe tolerance function is defined also for negative values\nf on this scale.) As predator density increases and de-\ncreases, prey exhibit reversible plasticity with induced and\nnoninduced phenotypes. Because there is a time lag before\nprey can attain their full plastic response, the match be-\ntween prey phenotype and the environmental state follows\na sequence with four conditions labeled as periods a, b,\nc, and d (see fig. 16.2 in Gabriel 1999). Setting the total\ntime budget to 1, period a is when predators are rare and\nprey exhibit the appropriate phenotype for the noninduc-\ning environmental state. Period b occurs after predator\nabundance has increased (the inducing environmental\nstate) but before prey have shifted to their induced phe-\nnotype. Period c follows with the inducing environmental\nstate and prey having shifted to their induced phenotype.\nFinally, period d is when predators are rare again (the\nnoninducing environmental state), but prey have not yet\nreturned to their noninduced state. After period d, prey\nreturns to the conditions of period a. Prey fitness for a\ngiven genotype is the multiplicative product of its fitnesses\nfrom the four periods weighted by their relative durations.\nPrey fitness in each of the four periods depends on a\ncomplex mix of phenotypic traits (behavior, size, shape,\nother morphological characters, etc.) and how they match\nvarious environmental selection pressures. Rather than at-\ntempt to explicitly model these plastic traits, we combine\ntheir effects on fitness into Gaussian environmental tol-\nerance curves that plot a given phenotype\u2019s fitness on an\nenvironmental gradient. In our model, the plastic re-\nsponses of prey are translated into changes in their en-\nvironmental tolerance curves.\nThe model not only is suitable for the simple scenario\nof two environmental states outlined above but also will\nhandle a continuum of environmental states. For example,\nif predation risk changes from instant to instant, the in-\nduced phenotype might also be altered to best fit the cur-\nrent environment. During its lifetime, an organism might\nexpress a variety of phenotypes depending on various en-\nvironmental cues. How well a phenotype is adapted to\nvarious environmental settings is described by a unimodal\nfitness function on an environmental gradient. After a\nproper scale transformation of the environmental gradient,\nthis function is a Gaussian curve so that its mode (pmean)\nand breadth (pSD) are sufficient to determine the fitness\nfunction. Lynch and Gabriel (1987) termed this the en-\nvironmental tolerance function. The mode is the environ-\nmental state that the organism is best adapted to (which\nmay or may not be the environment that it is found in).\nA small value of the breadth (i.e., a narrow fitness func-\ntion) represents a more specialized strategy, while a broad\nfitness function is more generalized. Both the mode and\nthe breadth of the environmental tolerance curves are re-\nversibly plastic.\nLynch and Gabriel (1987) thought in their model on\nenvironmental tolerance primarily about abiotic factors as\nenvironmental gradients. Additional considerations arise\nwhen the environmental gradient is a biotic factor. For\nexample, in predator-prey systems, the evolution of in-\nducible defenses might select for changes in behavior and\nmorphology of the predator (Kopp and Tollrian 2003).\nOur model is not suitable to describe such coevolutionary\nprocesses that would modify the predation risk. The pre-\ndictions of the model are valid only on a timescale for\nwhich evolutionary changes of predators can be neglected.\nThe predator behavior might be highly complex, and there\nmight be feedback from prey to predator; for example,\npredators\u2019 behavior might depend on the amount of in-\nducible defense present. The model can handle such a\nsystem as long as this complex behavior is calculable, and\nresults in a change in prey fitness can then be expressed\nby a unimodal function. We consider the environmental\nstate variable, f, to be a reliable measure of predation risk\nthat depends on predator density. If prey plasticity feeds\nback to affect future predator density, then the model\ncould be extended to consider population dynamics. Here,\nwe do not include this feedback; thus, our model is most\nsuitable for situations where predator density is deter-\nmined largely by external factors.\nIn this article, we extend the model of Gabriel (1999)\nby including variation in the environmental state and by\nconsidering the quality of information available to prey.\nGabriel (1999) started from a nonplastic genotype that is\nadapted only to a predator-free environment and asked\nfor the advantage of reversible plasticity under predation\nrisk. The genotypes were allowed to plastically express phe-\nnotypes that are adapted to an inducing environment, but\nthe noninduced phenotype was kept identical to the non-\nplastic genotype. In contrast to Gabriel (1999), we start\nfrom a nonplastic genotype that is constitutively defended\nby being adapted to the mean environment including pre-\ndation risk. Further, we also optimize the noninduced val-\nues of plastic genotypes. Therefore, noninduced values of\n342 The American Naturalist\nFigure 1: Tolerance curves that differ in the mode and the breadth of\nadaptation. Top, plasticity in the mode. Middle, plasticity in the breadth\nof adaptation. Bottom, plasticity in mode and breadth. Solid line, plastic\ngenotype. Dashed line, nonplastic genotype and noninduced plastic\ngenotype.\nmode and breadth of plastic genotypes can and will differ\nfrom the values of nonplastic genotypes.\nTo keep our model as simple as possible, we avoid com-\nplications arising from treating mode and breadth of tol-\nerance curves with all the details of quantitative traits (e.g.,\nwe do not account for developmental noise). Further, we\ndo not consider explicitly any kind of spatial heterogeneity.\nDuring period a, when predators are rare and prey are\nin the noninduced state, prey fitness is defined by the value\nof its noninduced fitness function at . During periodfp 0\nc, when predators are abundant and prey are in the in-\nduced state, prey fitness is the value of its induced fitness\nfunction at f. The interesting conditions are where prey\nare poorly adapted to their environments because of re-\nsponse lags. In period b, prey suffer the lowered fitness of\nbeing in the noninduced state when predation risk is high\n(f), and in period d, prey suffer the fitness cost of being\nin the induced state when predation risk is low ( ).fp 0\nAs in Gabriel (1999), we assume a specialist\/generalist\ntrade-off, that is, a broad fitness function comes at a cost\nof reduced maximum fitness at the mode. This trade-off\nis quantified without introduction of an extra parameter\nby assuming that the total area under the fitness curve is\na constant (see Lynch and Gabriel 1987). Thus, an increase\nin the breadth of the fitness curve requires a reduction in\nthe height of the fitness curve.\nThe degree to which individuals are mismatched with\ntheir environment depends on the environmental variation\nand the information prey receive about the environmental\nchanges. We consider two scenarios: first, predation risk\nvaries and prey have complete, accurate information about\npredation risk; second, predation risk is variable, but prey\nhave information only about the long-term level of\npredation risk in inducing environments (incomplete\ninformation).\nFinally, in order to better understand the relative im-\nportance of plastic shifts in the mode and breadth of tol-\nerance curves, we examined the net benefits associated\nwith two forms of reversible plasticity (see fig. 1): first,\nshifts in only the mode of the environmental tolerance\nfunctions, holding the breadths constant (m-plasticity);\nsecond, plasticity in both the mode and breadth of tol-\nerance functions (m-b-plasticity).\nWhat Do Shifts in the Mode and Breadth\nof Fitness Functions Mean?\nTo understand our model framework and results, it is\nnecessary to have a clear understanding of the meaning\nof shifts in the mode and breadth of environmental tol-\nerance functions. As noted above, the mode of a fitness\nfunction is the environmental state that the organism is\nbest adapted to, and the breadth of the function is the\ndegree to which the individual is specialized (narrow\nbreadth) or generalized (large breadth) in its range of ad-\naptation. For narrow tolerance functions, a mode shift\nrepresents a shift from one specialized adaptation to an-\nother, while an increase in breadth represents a shift from\na specialist to a generalist strategy (see fig. 1).\nMode shifts occur when conflicting traits are favored in\ndifferent environments. In the context of antipredator\ntraits, mode shifts might be associated with responses to\ndifferent types of predators. For example, Daphnia show\nopposite, adaptive plastic changes in life history in re-\nsponse to vertebrate versus invertebrate predators (Stibor\n1992). Daphnia respond to chemical cues from fish, which\nhunt visually and select larger daphnids, by shifting their\nenergy allocation from growth to reproduction, thus reach-\ning maturity earlier at a smaller size. They additionally\nproduce more but smaller offspring, which again reach\nmaturity at a smaller size (Lampert 1993). In contrast,\ninvertebrate predators, such as larvae of the phantom\nmidge Chaoborus, select smaller daphnids. In response to\nChaoborus, Daphnia shift their life history toward growth.\nReversible Plastic Responses 343\nThey thus reach maturity later at a larger size and produce\nfewer but larger offspring, which again reach maturity at\na larger size. Each set of plastic life-history changes in-\ncreases daphnid fitness in the presence of one type of\npredator while reducing their fitness in the presence of the\nother (Taylor and Gabriel 1992, 1993).\nAn increase in the breadth of environmental tolerance\nfunctions without a mode shift occurs when increased\nplasticity enhances fitness in the induced environment but\nthe organism still enjoys its highest fitness in the original\nnoninducing environment. This might be common when\nthe environmental gradient is simply the magnitude of\npredation risk and especially when the corresponding phe-\nnotypic shift has a limited defensive effect. Although prey-\ninduced defenses result in reduced predation rates (relative\nto no antipredator plasticity), prey usually still have higher\nfitness in the absence of predators than in the presence of\npredators because of costs associated with the defense for-\nmation and because the defense reduces but does not elim-\ninate mortality caused by predation. For example, the for-\nmation of morphological defenses like helmets or\nneckteeth in Daphnia offers protection when predators are\npresent but does not switch the mode of the fitness func-\ntion. Behavioral examples include sensitization to predator\ncues that increase alertness to predators in Daphnia (Pi-\njanowska 1994), which increases their ability to escape\npredators (Brewer et al. 1999) at the cost of a higher num-\nber of unnecessary escape responses.\nAlternatively, plasticity in the breadth of an environ-\nmental tolerance function can be visualized as a risk-\nspreading strategy. For example, if prey are threatened by\ncontrasting predation regimes that select for either small\nor large prey, and prey receive incomplete cues about pre-\ndation risk that give no information about whether large\nor small prey are currently at higher risk, then an adaptive\nstrategy that broadens the tolerance function would be to\nproduce a high variance in offspring size.\nMany plastic responses may be composed of shifts in\nboth the mode and breadth of environmental tolerance\nfunctions. In addition, the effect of a given plastic response\non changes in mode and breadth can depend on other\nselective forces outside of the main environmental gra-\ndient. For example, the type of shift in a tolerance function\ncan depend on the intensity of competition (Relyea 2002).\nIn the absence of strong competition, induced prey re-\nsponses to enhanced predation risk can cause a shift in\nbreadth, not a shift in the mode; that is, even when prey\nexhibit their induced phenotype, prey still probably have\nhigher fitness in the absence rather than the presence of\npredators. If, however, competition is particularly intense\nin the predator-free environment (Menge and Sutherland\n1976; Sih et al. 1985), then prey that display the predator-\ninduced phenotype might have a reduced fitness in the\npredator-free environment or, alternatively, an increased\nfitness in the predator environment because of exclusion\nof noninduced competitors. For example, in a predator-\nfree environment, prey might face strong competition that\nrequires high feeding activity, whereas in the presence of\npredators, prey must reduce their activity to hide from\npredators (Werner and Anholt 1993; Anholt and Werner\n1995). Each activity level would result in poor performance\nin the other environment. If the best environment for\nnoninduced prey is the predator-free one, while for in-\nduced prey, their best environment is one with predators,\nthe overall shift would likely be a combined shift in mode\nand breadth. This could even be a pure shift in the mode\nif competition would narrow the breadths of the tolerance\ncurves to be equal in the presence versus absence of\npredators.\nMethods and Notations\nWe use the following procedure to find optimal modes\nand breadths of tolerance functions. For a given scenario,\nwe first calculate fitness as it depends on free parameters.\nWe obtain the optimal values of these parameters by max-\nimizing the long-term geometric mean fitness of a given\ngenotype. For free parameters, we use the noninduced and\ninduced values of the mode and breadth of the tolerance\nfunction. Fitness depends on the following fixed param-\neters: time delays for response, relative length of the in-\nducing period, the value of the inducing environmental\nstate (e.g., current predation risk), and its temporal var-\niance. We calculate fitness for the following genotypes:\nnonplastic, plastic in the mode only, and plastic in mode\nand breadth. The fitness for plastic genotypes depends also\non the reliability of the inducing environmental cue. In\nour example of predator-prey systems, how much infor-\nmation prey have about predation risk affects the modes\nand breadths of tolerance functions. Complete and in-\ncomplete information are analyzed as extremes. Incom-\nplete information means that prey know when there is\nenhanced predation risk but cannot estimate the amount\nof predation risk.

When time lags are small\nrelative to the duration of the risky period (i.e., when the\nratio of is small) and prey have either complete in-t \/tr s\nformation about the value of f or incomplete information\nwith a low coefficient of variation for f, then prey should\nset the modes of their two tolerance curves close to the\ntwo environmental states (0 and f) and the breadths of\ntheir tolerance curves should be relatively narrow (figs. 4,\n5D). This is similar to what would be predicted by models\nwithout time lags. In this case, prey are relying primarily\non a pair of specialized defenses that are each optimal for\na narrow set of predator regimes.\nIf is small, prey have incomplete information aboutt \/tr s\nf, and f has a high coefficient of variation, then again\nprey set the modes of their two tolerance curves to closely\nmatch the two environmental states (0 and f); however,\nin that situation, they increase the breadth of their tol-\nerance curves, particularly the plastic tolerance curve (figs.\n4, 5B). Because these prey have incomplete knowledge of\nthe value of f during riskier times, they compensate by\nincreasing the breadth of their tolerance curve to cover a\ngreater range of f. In this case, individuals are still using\na specialized defense in the sense that their modes are far\napart, but they generalize their response to changing en-\nvironments by expanding the breadth of their tolerance\ncurves.\nAs increases, the cost of using the wrong tolerancet \/tr s\ncurve during lag periods increases. As a result, regardless\nof whether prey have complete or incomplete information\nabout predation risk, the modes of the two tolerance\ncurves converge (i.e., decreases; figs. 4, 5A, 5C).m \u0001mp n\nIn this sense, these prey are reducing their specialized de-\nfenses since the modes of their tolerance curves are be-\ncoming less different between environments. Instead, in-\ndividuals are compensating for increased lag times by using\ngeneralized defenses (i.e., converging modes and increased\nbreadths).\nFitness Benefits of Mode and Breadth Plasticity\nWith the optimal values for mode and breadth, we can\nnow calculate the fitness of the different genotypes to ex-\namine how plasticity in the mode and the breadth affects\nprey fitness with either complete or incomplete infor-\nmation.

This facilitates the analysis of the fitnessf\u00af\nadvantage of reversible plasticity.\nThe fitness benefits of plasticity in the mode and\/or\nbreadth for complete and incomplete information are\nshown in the ratio ( ) of fitnesses for plastic ge-w \/wm\u2026, \u2026 f\nnotypes and nonplastic genotypes (fig. 6). Plasticity in the\nmode increases the fitness of prey in comparison to no\nplasticity, and plasticity in the mode and breadth increases\nfitness in comparison to mode plasticity alone. These fit-\nness benefits depend on the coefficient of variation in f\n(table 2). If prey have complete information, the benefit\nof mode plasticity over no plasticity is unchanged or only\nincreases slightly as the coefficient of variation in f in-\ncreases. However, if prey have incomplete information\nabout the level of f, then the fitness benefit of mode\nplasticity relative to no plasticity declines sharply as the\ncoefficient of variation in f increases.\nThe fitness benefits of plasticity also depend on andtr\n. As the lag time ( ) decreases, prey can have tolerancet ts r\ncurves that are more specifically adapted to their present\nenvironment rather than the environment during the lag\ntime period. Therefore, as decreases, both mode plas-tr\nticity and mode and breadth plasticity have larger positive\neffects on prey fitness.\nDiscussion\nIt is obvious that reversible phenotypic plasticity can be\nadvantageous if an organism is exposed to variation in\nselection regimes during its lifetime. It might be, however,\nsurprising how large the corresponding selective advantage\ncan be. The model predictions are valid in a quite general\ncontext, but to avoid a too abstract discussion, the first\npart of the discussion will focus on antipredator ecology.\nWe will discuss how response lags and the pattern and\npredictability of variation in predation regimes should in-\nfluence patterns of prey plasticity with regard to both the\nmode and breadth of their environmental tolerance func-\ntions. In the second part of the discussion, we will con-\ncentrate on future directions of research, for example, how\ninherent limitations of the current model might be over-\ncome in order to improve the applicability to more specific\nsystems or to even more general questions.\nResponse Lags, Incomplete Information,\nand Antipredator Ecology\nIf prey can respond instantaneously to changing environ-\nments and have complete information about the current\nstate of their environment, then they should ignore other\npotential environmental states until those states occur; that\nis, they should ignore predators until predators arrive, and\nthey should not account for a world without predators\nuntil predators actually leave. We find that when prey have\nno response lag (i.e., ) and prey either have completet p 0r\ninformation or have incomplete information but CV pf\n, they should show high plasticity with their fitness0\nmodes, m, matched perfectly to the environmental optima,\n0 when predators are absent and f when predators are\npresent, and minimal breadths in their tolerance functions.\nThat is, they switch between one specialist strategy that\nideally matches the no predator situation (e.g., full feeding\nactivity in an open habitat) to another specialist strategy\nthat ideally matches an observed predation regime (e.g.,\nthe optimal degree of reduced activity and increased refuge\nuse).\nIndividuals often have response lags and incomplete in-\nformation about the current state of their environment\n(Stephens 1987; Sih 1992). We have shown that these lim-\nitations should cause prey to respond to anticipated sit-\nuations that they are not currently experiencing. Response\n348 The American Naturalist\nFigure 4: Influence of (lag time), (coefficient of variation in f), and information status (complete, incomplete) on the difference betweent CVr f\ninduced and noninduced plastic modes ( ) and on the size of plastic breadth.

If prey continue to\nbe highly active outside of a refuge even when predators\nare present, prey can obviously suffer high mortality (Sih\net al. 1988; Sih 1992). Conversely, if prey show long lags\nbefore resuming activity after predators have left an area,\nthey can suffer significant costs in terms of lost feeding or\nmating opportunities (Sih 1992). Our model shows that\nto reduce these costs, in each situation (i.e., predators\nabsent or present) prey should shift their modal strategy,\nm, toward the other situation and broaden their breadth\nof tolerance, b. Both of these shifts reduce fitness in the\ncurrent situation but increase the prey\u2019s ability to cope\nwith the new environment during the lag phase.\nThe degree of shift in m toward intermediate values\nreflects the trade-off between the benefit of being better\nat coping with new conditions during the lag phase (before\nprey show their full plastic response) versus the cost of\nreduced adaptation to current conditions. Increases in the\nlag time increase the benefit of preadapting to the other\nenvironment (fig. 5). As a result, when is large, preytr\nshould show relatively little shift in their fitness modes as\npredators come and go (i.e., as increases, andt m mr n p\nconverge). If predators are important ( approaches 1)ts\nand lag times are relatively long, prey should adopt a spe-\ncialized strategy that accounts for predators even when\npredators are not present; for example, prey should stay\nin safe flocks or maintain an intermediate degree of a\nmorphological defense even when predators are absent.\nAlternatively, if predators are only occasionally present\n( approaches 0) and lag times are relatively long, thents\nprey should exhibit only a weak specialized response to\npredators. In either situation, they can partially compen-\nsate for having the wrong specialized traits in one envi-\nronment by increasing their reliance on a generalized strat-\negy that increases their breadth of tolerance.\nGiven that response lags should be of critical impor-\ntance, we clearly need more data on response lags. De-\nvelopmental constraints presumably set a minimum value\nfor response times for a given type of character; for ex-\nample, morphological characters might usually have longer\nresponse lags than behavior simply because morphologies\ntake more time to build. However, theory and a few em-\npirical examples suggest that relative response lags can also\nbe shaped by information constraints and selection. De-\ntecting an increase in predation risk in many situations\nmay be quicker than detecting a decrease in predation risk.\nA single observation that a predator is present should im-\nmediately outweigh any prior estimates of low predation\nrisk, while each observation that predators are not present\nonly decreases the estimated probability that predators are\npresent (Mangel and Clark 1983). As a result, response\nlags should exhibit an asymmetry: prey should respond\nReversible Plastic Responses 349\nFigure 5: Tolerance curves corresponding to the end points of the three lines in figure 4 ( ).

Furthermore, an asymmetric re-\nsponse lag would be selected for in situations where once\npredators arrived, they might stay in the vicinity, and con-\nsequently a return is very likely. Relative response lags\nshould also depend on the type of cue used to detect\npredators. Chemical cues linger longer after predators\nleave than visual cues. Thus, prey that rely on chemical\ncues might exhibit longer recovery lags after predators\nleave.\nThe proportion of time that prey spend in the presence\nversus absence of predators should have important effects\non optimal prey strategies; that is, the temporal pattern\nof predation risk matters. In general, we predict that when\nis large, prey should show relatively few specialized re-tr\nsponses to rare situations. If predators are frequently pre-\nsent, then prey should retain specialized traits that keep\nthem safe from predation even when predators are absent.\nIf predators are rarely present, prey should show little\nspecialized response to predators but should rely instead\non a generalized response (i.e., a response that is only\nadequately effective at reducing risk but that allows them\nto maintain at least adequate feeding rates during the lag\nrecovery period after predators leave).\nOne other recent model examined effects of temporal\nvariation in predation risk on optimal antipredator be-\nhavior (Lima and Bednekoff 1999). They predicted that\nprey should show their strongest antipredator responses\nwhen predators are rare (i.e., during rare pulses of risk),\nwhereas if predators are frequently present, prey might\nhave to show relatively weak response to predators. The\ndifferences between our predictions reflect different as-\nsumed scenarios. Their results are based on the assumption\nthat prey require a threshold energy need that must be\nmet to survive (which we did not explicitly incorporate\nin our model), while we assumed response lags (which\nthey ignored). Thus, in their model, prey can afford to\nbecome totally inactive during rare predator encounters\nbut have to stay moderately active if predators are per-\nmanently present.\nEffects of the temporal pattern of risk on antipredator\nresponses have been largely ignored in antipredator ecol-\nogy; that is, models and experiments on antipredator ad-\naptations have typically examined prey responses to pred-\nator presence versus absence without reference to the\nproportion of time that predators are present. If is im-ts\nportant, then investigators should attempt to measure ts\nin nature and either account for it in their experimental\ndesigns or manipulate it as an experimental treatment\n(Lima and Bednekoff 1999; Sih and McCarthy 2002).\nFinally, incomplete information also had major effects\non predicted antipredator responses (fig. 4). In particular,\nif predation risk when predators are present is highly var-\niable (large ) and prey have information only on theCVf\nmean risk, then prey should show a very broad tolerance\ncurve in the presence of predators (fig. 4). That is, prey\n350 The American Naturalist\nFigure 6: Fitness advantage of plastic genotypes. Relative fitnesses are\ngiven as ratios of the fitnesses of a plastic genotype to a nonplastic\ngenotype.

We treated\nresponse lags, the duration and pattern of predation risk,\nand the quality of information prey have about predation\nrisk as parameters that influence prey patterns of plasticity.\nEach of these, however, could be variables that prey in-\nfluence in adaptive ways.\nThe duration of response lags ( ) can vary adaptivelytr\nin response to variations in the quality of information and\nthe costs of errors in plasticity (Sih 1992; Tollrian and\nHarvell 1999b). Further, these response lags could be adap-\ntively asymmetric, with prey more quickly switching to\ntheir induced form than to their noninduced form because\nof the asymmetry in the cost of incorrectly assessing the\ncurrent state of their environment or because of differences\nin how hard it is to detect the absence versus the presence\nof predators. Likewise, patterns of the duration of pre-\ndation risk ( ) can be determined not only by predatorts\nmovements but also by prey habitat selection (Sih et al.\n1988; Lima 1998), and information about predation re-\ngimes depends on prey sampling and learning. Future two-\ntiered models could blend how selection shapes these var-\niables (prey response lags, habitat selection, assessment of\npredation risk) that, in turn, affect adaptive reversible\nplasticity.\nWe did not explicitly implement possible costs of plas-\nticity in this model. (In many cases, the costs of plasticity\nshould be negligible compared with the indirect fitness\ncost of being in a suboptimal state.) If the costs of plasticity\nare an additional constant factor, independent of the\namount of expressed plasticity (as would be the case for\nthe general costs of sustaining the biochemical machinery\nfor reversible plasticity), then the model results for the\noptimal mode and breadth of tolerance curves would re-\nmain unchanged. However, if a substantial part of the cost\nof plasticity depends on the amount of plastic change (i.e.,\nif costs are a function of f), then the mode and breadth\nof tolerance curves might be changed.\nFurthermore, we did not include complications arising\nfrom possible costs and constraints of defense formations\n(DeWitt et al. 1998; Tollrian and Harvell 1999b). One ben-\nefit of plasticity (compared with having constitutively fixed\ntraits) is that the costs of maintaining a trait can be avoided\nduring periods when the trait is not needed. On the other\nhand, constraints might prevent the inducible formation\nof traits of the same magnitude as constitutively fixed\ntraits. Thus, constitutively fixed traits might provide a\nhigher maximal benefit, that is, defensive value in our\nscenario.\nIn this model, we have assumed that individuals ex-\nperience both the noninducing and inducing environ-\nments; thus, we examined the fitnesses of nonplastic and\nplastic genotypes summed over these environments. How-\never, in some cases, individuals or lineages can avoid en-\nvironments through diapause or migration. If individuals\nReversible Plastic Responses 351\ncan effectively avoid environments, then the tolerance\ncurves of these individuals should become specialized to\nmatch only the environments that they are going to ex-\nperience. Further modeling is needed to see how this av-\nenue to specialization would affect the evolution of re-\nversible plasticity.\nWe focused our description on prey responses to pred-\nators but still in general fitness terms. To generate more\ndirectly testable predictions on specific antipredator traits\n(e.g., refuge use, vigilance, life-history shifts, induced mor-\nphologies), we need explicit functions relating prey traits\nto fitness (including both risk and other fitness needs) as\na function of environmental risk gradients. Because prey\noften show multiple responses to predators (e.g., all of the\nresponses listed above; Endler 1995; DeWitt et al. 1998;\nTollrian and Dodson 1999) that differ in benefits, costs,\nand response lags, future models should address how mul-\ntiple responses should be integrated into an overall adap-\ntive response to a variable risk regime. All these compli-\ncations might lead to the coexistence of genotypes with\ndifferent strategies, as it is frequently found in natural\ncommunities (De Meester et al. 1995)\nOur model addressed patterns of plasticity in terms of\ngeneral fitness functions on general environmental gra-\ndients. Thus, our results should apply to any trait that\nexhibits reversible plasticity in response to environmental\nchange. The model equations can be solved without the\nsimplifying assumption of symmetric response delays\n(equations and solutions are given in Gabriel 2005), and\nsuch an extended version of the model should be used if\nthere is large asymmetry in response delays. Besides\npredator-prey interaction, the model could be fruitfully\napplied to plasticity in plants (for a recent review, see\nDudley 2004), but for some questions it might be necessary\nto extend the model by including spatial variation.\nOur model predicts that any organism that is exposed\nto a regularly occurring stress that typically is shorter than\ntheir average lifespan will be strongly selected to have re-\nversible plastic traits. Also, we have shown that the fitness\neffects of plastic traits can be described by tolerance func-\ntions with reversible plastic modes and breadths. Thus,\nthis model can be used for studying the causes of indi-\nvidual niche variation (recently reviewed by Bolnick et al.\n2003), with the breadth of an individual\u2019s niche being\nreversible. Using the concept of environmental tolerance\nfunctions, Lynch and Gabriel (1987) introduced the first\nmodel that could predict the evolution of niche width as\nit depends on environmental variability. Gabriel and Lynch\n(1992) studied the effects of irreversible plasticity on niche\nwidth but found that changes in the modes of environ-\nmental tolerance functions greatly outweigh changes in the\nbreadths of the functions. However, we have shown that\nthere are large fitness advantages for plasticity in the\nbreadth of environmental tolerance functions when that\nplasticity is reversible. Thus, we expect that reversible plas-\nticity will have significant impacts on the evolution of\nniches, but further extensions of the current model, in-\ncluding an explicit implementation of spatial heteroge-\nneity, will be needed to test this idea.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was conducted while W.G. was a sabbatical fellow\nat and as a part of the Inducible Defenses and Environ-\nmental Tolerance Working Group at the National Center\nfor Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a center funded by\nthe National Science Foundation (grant DEB-0072909), the\nUniversity of California, and the Santa Barbara campus.\nAdditional support was also provided for postdoctoral as-\nsociate B.L. in the group.
