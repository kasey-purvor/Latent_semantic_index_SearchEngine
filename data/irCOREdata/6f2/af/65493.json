In this paper, we examine the extent to\nwhich relative health inequalities between unem-\nployed and employed people vary across 23\nEuropean countries and by the different\napproaches to social protection taken by the five\nEuropean welfare state regimes (Scandinavian,\nAnglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern and Eastern).\nUnemployment and health\nAt the individual level, studies have particularly\nshown that unemployment is associated with\nworse mental health, including parasuicide.9 10 It\nhas also been linked to higher rates of all-cause\nmortality6 7 as well as limiting long-term illness,8\nand, in some studies, a higher prevalence of risky\nhealth behaviours (among young men), including\nproblematic alcohol use and smoking.11 At the area\nlevel, rates of unemployment, especially when used\nas indicators of deprivation, correlate with poorer\nneighbourhood health,12 and at the country level\nincreases in the unemployment rate have been\nassociated with increased mortality.13 Research has\nalso drawn attention to the contributory role of ill\nhealth itself as a factor behind unemployment\n(direct health selection),5 7 14 and the importance of\nill health-related worklessness in terms of socio-\neconomic health inequalities.15 Studies from var-\nious countries have identified poverty as an\nimportant intermediary factor in the relationship\nbetween unemployment and health.7\nWelfare state regimes\nWelfare provision, in the form of cash benefits and\nwelfare services, is acknowledged as an important\nmediatory factor in terms of the relationship\nbetween labour market position and health.16\u201319 A\ncrucial aspect of welfare provision, and one which\nmost differentiates welfare states, is income main-\ntenance (to prevent poverty),18 particularly during\nadverse events such as unemployment, old age or\nlong-term sickness absence.\nWelfare state regimes place those welfare states\nthat are the most similar (in terms of political\ntradition, principles, levels of provision, etc)\ntogether, emphasising within-regime coherence\nand between-regime differences.20 There are various\ncompeting welfare state regime typologies which\nemphasise diverse aspects of welfare states such as\nsocial expenditure levels, decommodification or\npolitical traditions (for an overview see Bambra\n22).21\u201324 Ferrera\u2019s fourfold typology,25 which focuses\non different dimensions of how social benefits are\ngranted and organised, has been highlighted as one\nof the most empirically accurate welfare state\nregime typologies.26\u201329 Ferrera 25 makes a distinction\nbetween the Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon,\nBismarckian and Southern countries (box 1).\nResearch report\n92 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:92\u201398. doi:10.1136\/jech.2008.077354\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nMore recently, the Eastern European countries have begun to be\nconsidered as a distinctive regime type.20 22 26 29 30\nWelfare state regimes and unemployment protection\nSocial protection during unemployment varies by welfare state\nregime. To a large degree this reflects the historical influence of\ndiffering political traditions, with those countries experiencing\nmore post-war years of Social Democratic rule providing more\ngenerous systems of support.24 Table 1 breaks down the various\ncharacteristics of social protection during unemployment in the\nfive different welfare state regimes. In essence, there are three\ninter-relating principles underpinning provision: universalism,\nsocial insurance and means-testing.18 Systems based on uni-\nversal provision do not make reference to previous contributions\nor means-testing and are offered to all citizens as long as specific\ndemographic, social or health criteria are fulfilled. Often flat-\nrate benefits are paid. Under social insurance systems, entitle-\nment to benefits is dependent on previous contributions and in\nmost cases subsequent benefit levels reflect previous earned\nincome. Under means-testing, entitlement is restricted on the\nbasis of income and the (often minimal) financial support is\ntargeted at those in most need, usually after they have\nexhausted all other means (eg, personal savings or social\ninsurance).31\nThe welfare provision of different regimes is governed by\nthese three principles in varying ways. For example, to differing\ndegrees of generosity, universalism is more prominent within\nthe Scandinavian welfare states (high population coverage) and\nthe Anglo-Saxon regime (fixed benefit rates for all), whereas\nsocial insurance is the key component of provision within the\nBismarckian, Southern and Eastern European welfare states.\nMeans-testing is more commonly a characteristic of the Anglo-\nSaxon welfare states; however, it is also used for social\nassistance payments in other welfare state regimes. For\nexample, in the UK (Anglo-Saxon) unemployment benefit\n(contribution-based Job Seekers Allowance) is only payable\n(for a maximum of 6 months) to those who fulfil the minimum\nNational Insurance contribution requirement within the 2 years\nbefore claiming (table 1). Most claimants do not meet this\ncriterion and are therefore reliant on means-tested social\nassistance benefits, particularly income-based Job Seeker\u2019s\nAllowance and Income Support.32 However, this mixed\napproach is also evident in Sweden, where there is a social\ninsurance-based benefit (Unemployment Insurance Benefit)\nbased on past contributions and which pays a benefit as a\nproportion of previous wages, as well as a means-tested social\nassistance scheme (Unemployment Assistance Benefit), which\npays a (lower) flat rate.32 Similarly, a three-tier system is\noperated in Germany (Bismarckian): those with a full contribu-\ntion record receive the full unemployment insurance benefit\n(Arbeitslosengeld), those with a smaller contribution criteria,\nreceive a means-tested insurance benefit (Arbeitslosenhilfe)\nwhereas those who do not have a sufficient contribution record\nmust rely upon the Sozialhilfe social assistance scheme.32\nUnemployment protection in each welfare state regime\ntherefore represents a complex mix of these differing principles.\nHowever, there are clear differences by welfare state regime, due\nto the influence of differing political traditions, in terms of how\nthese principles are operationalised, particularly in terms of the\ngenerosity of benefits paid to the unemployed (replacement\nrates), the qualifying period and conditions, duration of benefit\npayments and the waiting period before entitlement is\nactivated. In each of these regards, the Scandinavian welfare\nstates are generally more generous than the other welfare state\nregimes (table 1), particularly compared with the Anglo-Saxon\nand Eastern European regimes.\nWelfare state regimes, unemployment protection and health\nDifferences in the social protection offered to the unemployed\ncould therefore be an important mediatory factor in the\nrelationship between poverty, unemployment and health.7\nThis could be very important in terms of helping to develop\npolicy interventions, particularly in terms of income main-\ntenance provision, to improve the health of the unemployed,\nreduce inequalities between those in and out of work, and\nthereby potentially reduce the influence of labour market status\non health. Indeed, a study comparing means-tested and non-\nmeans-tested unemployment benefits in three countries (UK,\nGermany, USA) found that among the unemployed, those in\nreceipt of non-means-tested benefits had better health than\nthose in receipt of means-tested benefits.3\nHowever, as previous studies of the relationship between\nunemployment and health have tended to focus either on\nassociations between unemployment and health,7 or changes to\nthe employment status of people and their subsequent health,\nwithin one country,5 8 or in a very limited number of similar\ncountries,3 a full examination of the possibly health protective\nrole of different approaches to social protection has not yet been\nundertaken. Similarly, although there is an emerging compara-\ntive social epidemiology literature that examines differences in\nhealth by welfare state regime,17 19 22 26 28 29 35\u201339 there has to date\nbeen little analysis by population sub-group.22 Therefore, in this\nstudy we examine the relationship between unemployment and\nself-reported health in 23 countries through reference to the\ndifferent approaches to social protection taken by five different\nwelfare state regimes. Specifically, given the differences in social\nprovision by welfare state regime (as described in box 1 and\ntable 1), we test the following two inter-related hypotheses: (1)\nthat the self-reported health of the unemployed will be worse\nthan the employed in all welfare state regimes, and (2) that the\nunemployed in those welfare state regimes with higher levels of\nsocial protection (the Scandinavian and Bismarckian regimes)\nwill have comparatively better self-reported health than those in\nthe other welfare state regimes (Anglo-Saxon, Southern and\nEastern).\nMETHODS\nData\nThe data source is made up of two independent waves of the\nEuropean Social Survey (ESS) (merged files from 2002 and\n2004), from which we analysed 37 499 individuals (aged 25\u201360\nyears) from 21 countries (table 2). The two health outcome\nvariables were self-reported limiting long-standing illness and\nfair\/poor general health. The main objective of the ESS is to\nprovide high-quality data over time about changing social\nattitudes and values in Europe. The data and extensive\ndocumentation are freely available for downloading at the\nNorwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD) web site (www.\nnsd.uib.no).\nWe used two indicators of morbidity available in the ESS:\nself-reported general health and limiting long-standing illness.\nSelf-reported general health was constructed from a variable\nasking \u2018\u2018How is your (physical and mental) health in general?\u2019\u2019\nEligible responses were \u2018\u2018very good\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018fair\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019. We dichotomised the variable into \u2018\u2018very good or\ngood\u2019\u2019 health versus \u2018\u2018less than good\u2019\u2019 health (\u2018\u2018fair\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019). As for limiting long-standing illness, people were\nResearch report\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:92\u201398. doi:10.1136\/jech.2008.077354 93\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nasked if they were hampered in daily activities in any way by\nany long-standing illness or disability, infirmity or mental\nhealth problem. Eligible responses were \u2018\u2018yes a lot\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018yes to\nsome extent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019. We dichotomised this variable into\n\u2018\u2018yes\u2019\u2019 (regardless of whether to some extent or a lot) and \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019.\nUnemployment was measured by comparing unemployed\n(including both those currently looking for a job and those\nwho are not) with people in paid work. The question asked in\nthe survey was \u2018\u2018what is your main activity, the last 7 days?\u2019\u2019\nCorrelation tests between the reporting of employment status\nin the ESS largely correspond with the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) rates from\n2003 (table 2, last column). People who were currently under\neducation, permanently sick or disabled, retired, doing commu-\nnity or military service were excluded from the analysis along\nwith those doing housework\/looking after children. A weight\nwas applied in all analyses to correct for design effects due to\nsampling designs in countries where not all individuals in the\npopulation have an identical selection probability. All analyses\nwere done for men and women separately.\nAnalysis\nRelative health inequalities were calculated applying a series of\nlogistic regression analyses, in which unemployment was\nintroduced as an independent variable, controlled for age, with\nhealth outcomes as the dependent variables. Prevalence rates and\nrate differences were calculated additionally, using direct age\nstandardisation. In addition, to test the robustness of the main\nfindings, three sensitivity analyses were performed. First, the\nbetween-regime differences in the relationship between unem-\nployment and health were tested separately for men and women\nusing the interaction \u2018\u2018employment status*regime\u2019\u2019 within a\nmulti-level design. Second, one-way analysis of variance was used\nto examine whether the between-regime differences in health\noutcomes (overall prevalence, prevalence among unemployed,\nrate difference and relative inequalities) were greater than the\nwithin-regime differences. Finally, additional adjustments were\nmade for between-regime differences in the prevalence of\nunemployment (by sex and country) and differences between\nregimes in terms of the socioeconomic status (education and\noccupational class) of the unemployed were also examined. These\nanalyses are detailed further in the online appendix.\nRESULTS\nORs (along with prevalence rates and rate differences) of ill\nhealth are presented in table 3 for men and women within each\nwelfare regime separately (country-specific data are presented in\ntable 1 in the Web-only appendix). All results in this table\nindicate that unemployed people feel unhealthier than those\nwho report to be employed. This association is significant for all\noutcomes, with the single exception of men with limiting long-\nstanding illness (OR 1.67) in the Anglo-Saxon welfare regime.\nThere are also clear differences by welfare state regime.\nRelative inequalities between employed and unemployed were\nlargest in the Anglo-Saxon (men ORPH 2.97, 1.92 to 4.60;\nwomen ORLI 2.73, 1.50 to 4.95 and ORPH 2.78, 1.63 to 4.73)\nBismarckian (men only ORLI 2.21, 1.74 to 2.79 and ORPH 2.72,\n2.21 to 3.35) and Scandinavian (women only ORLI 2.28, 1.71 to\n3.03 and ORPH 2.99, 2.34 to 4.00) regimes, and smallest in the\nSouthern (men ORPH 1.82, 1.35 to 2.46; women ORLI 1.52,\n1.03 to 2.25 and ORPH 1.66, 1.31 to 2.11) and Eastern (women\nonly ORLI 1.65, 1.24 to 2.10 and ORPH 1.76, 1.38 to 2.25) welfare\nstate regimes.\nAccording to the size of rate differences and ORs, it appears\nthat the negative health experiences of being unemployed\nare particularly strong for women within the Anglo-Saxon\n(ORLI 2.73 and ORPH 2.78) and Scandinavian (ORLI 2.28 and\nORPH 2.99) welfare regime. Although the ORs of men\u2019s reporting\nof limiting long-standing illness do not show a distinct pattern\n(except from the non-significant results in the Anglo-Saxon\nregime), the reporting of poor general health within the Anglo-\nSaxon regime again demonstrates the largest ORs.\nThe sensitivity analyses (presented in the online appendix)\nshow that welfare state regimes are strongly related to the\nassociation of unemployment and women\u2019s health and, in terms\nof health outcomes, that within-welfare state regime variance is\nsignificantly smaller than between-welfare state regime variance\nfor measures of prevalence (but not with regard to rate\ndifferences and relative inequalities).

The role of the family is also emphasised and the\nredistributive impact is minimal. However, the role of the market\nis marginalised.\n3. Anglo-Saxon\nState provision of welfare is minimal, social protection levels are\nmodest and often attract strict entitlement criteria, and recipients\nare usually means-tested and stigmatised. In this model, the\ndominance of the market is encouraged both passively, by\nguaranteeing only a minimum, and actively, by subsidising private\nwelfare schemes. The Anglo-Saxon welfare state regime thereby\nminimises the decommodification effects of the welfare state and\na stark division exists between those, largely the poor, who rely\non state aid and those who are able to afford private provision.\n4. Southern\nThe southern welfare states have been described as \u2018\u2018rudimen-\ntary\u2019\u2019 because they are characterised by their fragmented system\nof welfare provision that which consists of diverse income\nmaintenance schemes that range from the meagre to the\ngenerous and welfare services, particularly, the health care\nsystem, that provide only limited and partial coverage. Reliance\non the family and voluntary sector is also a prominent feature.\n5. Eastern\nThe formerly Communist countries of East Europe have\nexperienced the demise of the universalism of the Communist\nwelfare state and a shift towards policies associated more with\nthe Anglo-Saxon welfare state regime, notably marketisation and\ndecentralisation. In comparison with the other member states of\nthe European Union, they have limited welfare services.\nResearch report\n94 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:92\u201398. doi:10.1136\/jech.2008.077354\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nrate differences and ORs was more evident for women than for\nmen. The additional adjustments made for the prevalence of\nunemployment confirmed the main findings, that the associa-\ntion between unemployment and health varies by welfare state\nregime, and in addition, a high correlation as found between the\noriginal ORs and the ORs adjusted for the prevalence of\nunemployment (r = 0.85 or higher). This suggests that it is not\nthe higher prevalence of unemployment in some welfare states\nwhich has driven the observed differences in the health of the\nunemployed by welfare state regime. The sensitivity analyses\nalso found that unemployed men and women were more likely\nto be from the lower socioeconomic groups than employed\npeople in all welfare state regimes.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study has found that the relationship between unemploy-\nment and health is consistent across all 23 European countries\nwith the unemployed in each country reporting worse self-\nreported health than the employed (either LI, PH or both). This\nis in keeping with our first hypothesis and in line with the\nmajority of the existing research literature.5 7 8 40 For example, a\nlongitudinal Swedish study found that self-reported physical\nhealth decreased with the advent of unemployment and that\npoorer self-reported physical health increased the likelihood of\nfuture unemployment.5 Similarly, a longitudinal study of UK\nmen found an increased risk of limiting long-standing illness\namong the unemployed.8 It seems, therefore, that even though\nthe levels of social protection offered to the unemployed vary by\nwelfare state (and welfare state regime), in all countries, a\nrelationship exists between unemployment and poorer self-\nrated health. This suggests that current wage replacement rates,\neven in the more generous welfare states, are not sufficient to\novercome the financial effects of unemployment on health. On\nthe other hand, it may indicate the importance for health of the\nnon-financial losses associated with unemployment (eg, social\nTable 1 Characteristics of unemployment protection in 23 European countries, ranked by welfare state regime (2004)33 34\nWelfare regime (1\u20135,\nhigh\u2013low) Country Funding system Qualifying period*\nInitial net\nreplacement rate (%\nof net average\nwages){\nUnemployment\ninsurance benefit\nduration (months){\nWaiting\nperiod (days)1\n1.

Specifically, we have\nfound that relative inequalities are largest in the Anglo-Saxon,\nBismarckian (men only), and Scandinavian (women only)\nregimes, and smallest in the Southern and Eastern (women\nonly). The findings for the Anglo-Saxon welfare state regime are\nperhaps unsurprising given that wage replacement rates for the\nunemployed are the lowest in these welfare states, and that\nbenefits are means-tested and subject to strict entitlement rules.\nThe unemployed in the Anglo-Saxon welfare states are there-\nfore at a great financial disadvantage in comparison to those in\nemployment and this may well explain the magnitude of\ninequality as financial strain has been found to be an important\nfactor in the relationship between unemployment and ill\nhealth.7 41 42 Furthermore, means-tested benefits are associated\nwith stigma18 and so the non-financial problems of unemploy-\nment may be greater in the Anglo-Saxon welfare states.

The length of entitlement\nto social insurance is also comparatively low in the Bismarckian\nwelfare states (table 1). That relative inequalities are greater\nbetween men than women, may also be in part due to stigma as\nthe familial approach of the Bismarckian welfare states\nemphasises the male breadwinner role.28 45 46 In terms of the\nScandinavian welfare state regime, the relatively large inequal-\nities between employed and unemployed women may well\nreflect the fact that women are less likely to meet the\nqualification criteria for social insurance payments (for example\ndue to higher rates of part-time working)47 and are therefore\ndependent on social assistance benefits which have a lower\noverall replacement rate.48\nIt is of interest that the smallest relative inequalities between\nemployed and unemployed were found in the Southern and\nEastern welfare states. For example, the health differences\nbetween unemployed and employed people in the East\nEuropean welfare regime were never larger than OR = 2.15\nthroughout the study (table 3). This is somewhat counter to the\nwider inequalities in health literature, which suggests that\nrelative inequalities in health by socioeconomic status should be\nlarger in these countries.49 50 This finding is therefore very\nsurprising and clearly requires further analysis (perhaps looking\nat individual countries in these regimes in more depth), not least\nas the replacement rates and eligibility criteria for the Southern\nand Eastern welfare state regimes are not particularly generous,\nholding a fairly moderate position in relation to other regimes\n(table 1). One possible explanation for the finding is that the\nmore traditional family model in these countries means that\nadditional material, and non-material, support is provided by\nthe family to unemployed members thus buffering the impact\nof unemployment on health.\nOur main results and the sensitivity analyses also suggest\nthat there is an important gender dimension to the relationship\nbetween unemployment and poorer self-reported health. Health\ninequalities between the unemployed and employed were larger\namong women, most strikingly in the Anglo-Saxon and\nScandinavian welfare state regimes. First, this is in contrast to\nmost single country, longitudinal studies, in which the relation-\nship between unemployment and poor health has generally\nfound to be more noticeable among men. Caution should\ntherefore be applied to our findings until they are replicated.\nHowever, from a social protection perspective it is less\nsurprising that women experience a more adverse impact on\nhealth of unemployment. Women are often not entitled to the\nhigher value social insurance benefits, due to a less coherent\nemployment history, for example, part-time work, periods out\nof work due to caring etc, and therefore have to rely on lower\nlevel social assistance, which provides much lower replacement\nrates, even in the more generous Scandinavian welfare states. It\nis also possible that the selection effect is stronger for women\nthan men, that is that unhealthy women are more likely to\nbecome unemployed than unhealthy men. Future research\nclearly needs to explore further the relationship between\nwomen, unemployment and health, and the role that the\nwelfare state can play in supporting the needs of an increasingly\nfeminised European workforce.\nLimitations\nAlthough the ESS presents an outstanding opportunity to\ninvestigate cross-national patterns of health inequality, as the\nsurvey asks the same questions at the same time in all countries,\nwe acknowledge that there are many issues which may affect\nthe comparability of multi-country studies, such as variations in\nresponse rate (table 2), modes of data collection, translations,\ncultural interpretation and conduct.26 29 Our study is further\nlimited by utilising only self-reported health measures which\nmay vary by country, socioeconomic or employment status\nand\/or culture. For example, an unemployed immigrant living\nin Spain may use different criteria to define his or her health\nthan an unemployed Finn living in Finland. However, studies\nhave found a strong relationship, which does not vary by\nsocioeconomic status,51 between self-reported health and\nmortality.52 Similarly, the measure of unemployment (unem-\nployed in the last 7 days) may obscure important between\ncountry differences in the composition of the unemployed\npopulation (online appendix). Further, the complex nature of\nthe relationship between unemployment and health means\nthat, despite conducting a number of sensitivity analyses, we\nWhat is already known on this subject\nc Single-country studies have shown that unemployment is\nassociated with worse morbidity and mortality.\nc Poverty may be an important mediatory factor in this\nrelationship.\nc Different types of European welfare state (welfare state\nregimes) offer different levels of social protection to the\nunemployed.\nc Unemployed people in receipt of means-tested benefits have\nworse health than those in receipt of entitlement benefits.\nWhat this study adds\nc This study examines whether the relationship between\nunemployment and health varies by European welfare state\nregime and, if so, the extent to which this can this be\nexplained through reference to the different types of social\nprotection.\nc The negative relationship between unemployment and health\nis consistent across Europe but varies by welfare state regime,\nsuggesting that levels of social protection may indeed have a\nmoderating influence.\nc The negative relationship is particularly strong among women\nand in those countries with low replacement rates and which\nutilise means-tested benefits.\nPolicy implications\nc Unemployment has a negative relationship with health; this\nmay in part be due to the loss of income associated with\nunemployment. Income levels for the unemployed therefore\nneed to be adequate to prevent health damage.\nc Relative health inequalities between the employed and\nunemployed were greatest in those welfare states that utilised\nmeans-tested benefits.\nc Welfare state arrangements need to be more sensitive to\nmoderating the effects of unemployment on the health of\nwomen, particularly as the European workforce is becoming\nincreasingly feminised.\nResearch report\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:92\u201398. doi:10.1136\/jech.2008.077354 97\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nhave not covered all the possible factors influencing between\ncountry differences.
