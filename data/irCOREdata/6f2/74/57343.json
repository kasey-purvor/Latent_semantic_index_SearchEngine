Introduction \n \nThe main conventional explosive employed globally by military forces in the last \ncentury was 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).  Throughout the world, it has been \nextensively released to the environment during manufacture, deployment and disposal \n(Talmage et al., 1999).  Even though the contamination of the marine environment \nby munitions has not generally been well documented (Cruz-Uribe et al., 2007), it is \nwell known that substantial dumping of UXO (unexploded ordnance) at sea has \noccurred worldwide with considerable amounts deposited in the North Sea. This area \nis covered by the Oslo\/Paris agreement which provides a legal framework for the \nprotection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR, 2005).  \nAdditionally, explosives contamination emanating from military ranges is recognised \n3 \n \nto be an international problem (Clausen et al., 2004).  Little appears to have been \npublished on the situation in the UK, but it would seem safe to assume that ranges in \nthe UK suffer similar contamination issues to those documented for Canada and the \nUSA (Jenkins et al., 2006; MacDonald, 2001).  There are some 140 defence sites on \nthe UK coast and these are predominantly used for live firing or explosive trials \n(Coulson & Brooks, 2006).  Because of the relative ease of sampling, we opted to \nobtain intertidal seawater from the eastern English North sea coast and determine its \nability to attenuate TNT and so derive an indication of the ability of intertidal \nseawater to mitigate the well-documented toxic threat to littoral benthic organisms \nthat TNT poses (Ek et al., 2007; Green et al., 1999; Lotufo et al., 2001; Rosen & \nLotufo, 2005; Rosen & Lotufo, 2007; Won et al., 1976). In general, these toxicity \nstudies using nitrotoluene compounds have reported that toxicity decreases as the \nextent of nitrogenation falls, thus TNT is more toxic to marine organisms than DNT. \nLaboratory investigations aimed at developing marine toxicity data for a range of \nordnance compounds gave LOEC (lowest effect concentrations) survival endpoints \nvalues of 1.34 mg\/L Mysid, 10.8 mg\/L Redfish Lavae and 11.6 mg\/L Polycheate \n(Nipper et al., 2001). It has also been established that a crtitical body burden of 83 to \n172 \u00b5mol\/kg for marine amphipod Eohaustorius Estuarius and that the median \neffective concentration (EC50) values of Mytillus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean \nMussel) of 0.75 and 19.5 \u00b5mol\/L for larval and adult stages respectively (Rosen & \nLotufo, 2005).  \n4 \n \n  The main aim of this study was to assess the ability of seawater, either with or \nwithout sediment present, to attenuate TNT under conditions similar to those \nencountered in the eastern English North sea coast. \n  \n2. Material and methods \n \n2.1 Sampling and Microcosm Preparation \n \nIntertidal seawater was collected on January 6th 2009 from the North Sea at \nAnderby Creek, Lincolnshire, UK.  Stored in 2.5 L sterilised amber glass bottles, it \nwas transported to the laboratory in cool boxes and stored in an incubator at \n7.0\u00b0C\u00b10.1\u00b0C.  Immediately before use the oxygen status of the seawater was \ndetermined, by Alsterberg\u2019s modified Winkler titration (Rodier, 1975), to confirm its \naerobic nature and, thereby, validate the use of aerobic microcosms as appropriate for \nthe TNT attenuation study.  The dissolved oxygen content (dO2), under these \nconditions, was found to be 8.04 mg\/L which was comparable with other published \ndeterminations.  Thus, the dissolved oxygen content of North Sea water has been \nreported and, for diverse locations measured in both summer and winter, bottom \nwaters were found to range between 6.0 mg\/L and 11.3 mg\/L (Lohse et al., 1996).  \nCoastal surface water in the Southern Bight of the North Sea gave a range 7.1 mg\/L \nto 12.6 mg\/L for measurements made both in summer and winter (Frankignoulle et \nal., 1996). \n5 \n \nThe two marine sediments investigated were a fine-grained clayey sediment \n(Sediment A) and a coarse-grained sandy sediment (Sediment B).  The sediments \nwere collected on May 2nd 2008 from the North Sea using a Day Grab, the sediments \nhad the following characteristics: \nSediment A (Clayey) :  Sand 14.4%, Clay 19.5%, Silt 66.1% and TOC 2.23% \nSediment B (Sandy) :  Sand 92.5%, Clay  2.0%, Silt  5.5% and TOC <0.10%  \nFor spiking the microcosms a saturated solution of TNT in seawater was \nprepared by weighing 300 mg of TNT into 2 litres of seawater.  TNT is cited as \nhaving a solubility of 140 mg\/L in pure water at 25\u00b0C (Gorontzy et al., 1994), but it is \nless soluble in saline waters (Prak & O'Sullivan, 2006).  The mixture was \nperiodically inverted and shaken over three hours then left to stand.  \nThe effect of supplying additional carbon sources was studied to some of the \nmicrocosms to see if these might enhance microbially-mediated TNT degradation. \nGiven that the dissolved organic carbon content (DOC) of North Sea water is ca. 2.5 \nmg\/l (Ferrari, 2000), an additional 2.5 mg\/L DOC was added to create the \u2018fed\u2019 \nmicrocosms.  For this purpose a concentrated feeding solution, containing 25 g\/L of \nDOC, was prepared by dissolving 0.284 g sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.147 g 85% \nDL-lactic acid, 0.128 g glycerol, 0.125 g D-glucose, 0.123 L-glutamic acid in sterile \npure water, and adjusting the pH of the resulting solution to 8.0 (i.e. the pH of the \ncollected seawater) with sodium hydroxide solution before making to 10 ml.  Each \ncomponent was calculated to contribute 5 g\/L of DOC to the concentrate and all were \nchosen after due consideration of the relevant literature on marine microbiology \n6 \n \n(Baumann et al., 1972; Donderski et al., 1998; Eilers et al., 2000; Hagstrom et al., \n2001; Jannasch, 1967; Jannasch, 1968; Jannasch, 1969).  Fed microcosms were \nmade from either sterile or non-sterile seawater that contained 110 \u00b5l\/L of the 25 g\/L \nfeeding concentrate.  When made to their final volume in the microcosms this gave \n2.5 mg\/L of added DOC.   \nMicrocosms, whose contents had been sterilised by the addition of sodium azide, were \ncompared to similar microcosms that contained no sterilant to permit an assessment of \nthe contribution of microbially-mediated degradation.  Sterile seawater was prepared \nby adding 2.22 g\/L of sodium azide to some of the collected seawater.  Once the \nmicrocosms were made up this gave a final sodium azide concentration of 0.2% w\/v - \na level at which azide has been shown to act as an effective biocide (Harrison et al., \n2003).  To make allowance for the effect of azide addition upon sodium content, the \nseawater to be used for the non-sterile microcosms was similarly adjusted by the \naddition 2.00 g\/L of sodium chloride.  Given the overall salinity of seawater from the \nNorth Sea varies between 3.10% and 3.52% (Jones & Howarth, 1995), the influence \nof these additions on the ionic strength of the seawater was deemed negligible. One \nlimitation of this study was that the sterility of samples was not checked by microbial \nplate counts. Alternative measures to sterilize the microcosms by for example 60Co \nirradiation were not conducted, thus complete microbial inhibition cannot be \ncompletely shown.  A second limitation of this study was that no metabolites were \nmeasured.         \n7 \n \n Six sets of sacrificial microcosms (SMs) were constructed with 12 microcosms \nper set.  Each microcosm consisted of a sterilised 60 ml amber glass bottle \ncontaining 2 g of marine sediment together with 40 ml of sterile or non-sterile \nseawater, either fed or unfed.  The solution to solid ratio was accordingly 20:1, \nsimilar to the 18:1 ratio previously employed for the determination of environmental \nprocess descriptors for TNT (Yost et al., 2007).   \nSMs 1:  UAN  (Sediment A, Unfed non-sterile seawater) \nSMs 2: UAS  (Sediment A, Unfed sterile seawater) \nSMs 3: FAN (Sediment A, Fed non-sterile seawater) \nSMs 4:  FAS (Sediment A, Fed sterile seawater) \nSMs 5: FBN (Sediment B, Fed non-sterile seawater) \nSMs 6: FBS (Sediment B, Fed sterile seawater) \n Once prepared, the microcosms were left to acclimatize for 45 days in the \nincubator at 7\u00b0C.  This temperature was selected to approximate typical winter sea \nsurface and coastal bottom temperatures, in the North Sea (Becker & Pauly, 1996; \nLane & Prandle, 1996; O'Brien et al., 2000).  Following acclimation, the \nmicrocosms were each spiked with 4 ml of the saturated TNT in seawater, shaken and \nreturned to the incubator.  The initial TNT concentration was derived by spiking 4 \nml of the saturated TNT into 40 ml seawater, with no sediment present, and \nimmediately analysing the resulting solution by High Performance Liquid \nChromatography (HPLC).  A value of 10.02 mg\/l was obtained for the TNT \n8 \n \nconcentration by analysis of this sample.  The uncertainty in the analysis at this \nconcentration, for a 95% confidence level, was calculated to be 0.94%.  \n Additionally, four large microcosms (LMs) were constructed in 2.5 L amber \nbottles that contained no sediment.   \nLM 1: UN (Unfed non-sterile seawater) (2 L seawater + 220 mL saturated TNT) \nLM 2: US (Unfed sterile seawater) (2 L seawater + 220 mL saturated TNT + 4.44 g \nsodium azide) \nLM 3: FN (Fed non-sterile seawater) (2 L seawater + 220 mL saturated TNT + 220 \n\u00b5l feed concentrate) \nLM 4: FS (Fed sterile seawater) (2 L seawater + 220 mL saturated TNT + 220 \u00b5l \nfeed concentrate + 4.44 g sodium azide) \nThe LMs were also placed in the incubator and both LMs and sacrificial microcosms \nwere inverted and shaken to suspend the sediment once a day.  Periodically, the LMs \nand sacrificial microcosms were sampled by taking 0.5 ml in a glass GT (gas-tight) \nsyringe for HPLC analysis.  Once a week the headspace air in all microcosms was \nexchanged for fresh, filtered (Whatman Hepa-Vent) air to ensure the maintenance of \naerobic conditions.  All the chemicals referred to in this section were obtained from \nSigma-Aldrich UK except for TNT which was supplied by Greyhound \nChromatography & Allied Chemicals, UK.  \n \n2.2 High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis \n \n9 \n \nSamples of 0.5 ml, taken from either the sacrificial microcosms or the LMs, were \n0.2 \u00b5m filtered (Millex - 4 mm nylon 66 in-line syringe filters) during injection \nthrough the 100 \u00b5l sampling loop (Rheodyne) installed on the HPLC system.  A \nreversed-phase HPLC column (Dionex Acclaim E1 5\u00b5m: 250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.), \nmaintained at 38\u00b0C by a column oven (Grace\/Vydac 7995R), was used for the \nanalysis.  The mobile phase, composed of a mixture of 430 ml of methanol \n(Rathburn UK) and 570 ml water (MilliQ), vacuum degassed in-line (CSI 6150 \nCambridge Scientific Instruments UK), was pumped at 1 ml\/min (Merck-Hitachi \nIsocratic L6000 Pump).   Detection was performed at 254 nm (TSP UV2000 \nThermo-Separation Products).  A five point calibration was found to be linear over \nthe range 0 \u2013 15 mg\/l (r2 = 1.00).   The calibration was conducted with a standard \nexplosive mixture containing 14 nitroaromatic\/nitramine components, each at 1 g\/l \n(Accustandard Inc. USA), suitably diluted using the 5 g\/l aq. calcium chloride \ndilution technique described in Method 8330 (USEPA, 1994).     \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n \nEach of the LMs (no sediment), containing a total initial volume of 2.22 L, was \nsampled a total of seven times with 0.5 ml being taken for each sample.  Thus, 3.5 \nml was eventually removed from each.  Unlike the SMs, where sediment was \npresent, the repeated removal of small samples from the LMs was considered justified \nsince the small reduction in volume from repeated sampling would not affect the \n10 \n \noverall liquid to solid ratio (there being no solid except for the glass walls of the \nLMs).  The results from the periodic sampling of the LMs over 163 days are \npresented in Fig. 1.  Exponential curve fitting to the graphs appearing in Fig.1 \nproduced the data for the LMs that are displayed in Table 1.    \nInspection of Fig. 1 revealed that there were small decreases in TNT \nconcentrations over the period for all the no-sediment microcosms. The pseudo \nfirst-order rate constant (k) for the sterile fed and unfed microcosms was 0.00041 \nday-1 and 0.00020 day-1 respectively (Table 1).  Because the degradation in these \nmicrocosms was abiotic, it was probable that the losses of TNT were due to chemical \nreactions, but not photolysis, since the microcosms were maintained in the dark.  \nThus, for instance, TNT could have reacted with amino moieties of the proteinaceous \nmaterial, and the dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), known to be present in \nseawater (Keil & Kirchman, 1993).  Indeed, the reaction of TNT with amino acids to \nform Meisenheimer complexes has been proposed for use in the clean-up of \nTNT-contaminated soils (Fant et al., 2001).  Since one of the components used for \nfeeding the microcosm was an amino acid, (i.e. L-glutamic acid), this would account \nplausibly for the increased rate of TNT attenuation in the fed, compared with the \nunfed, microcosm.  For the non-sterile fed and unfed microcosms k was 0.00094 \nday-1 and 0.00036 day-1 respectively.  That these rates were greater in comparison \nwith their sterile counterparts reflects the contribution of the seawater\u2019s indigenous \nmicrobial community to the TNTs rate of disappearance.  For the sterile LMs, k of \nthe fed is approximately double that of the unfed, whereas, for the non-sterile, k of the \n11 \n \nfed is about 2.6 times that of the unfed, suggesting that feeding to some extent \nenhanced the activity of the microbial community.    \nFor the sacrificial microcosms, each sample was taken from the incubator at a \nprescribed time and shaken.  A 0.5 ml sample was then taken immediately and \ninjected into the HPLC via an in-line filter (see 2.2).  Afterwards, the microcosm \nwas discarded.  This sacrificial strategy was instituted, in the case of microcosms \ncontaining sediment, because of the alteration to solid\/solution ratios that would be \nimposed by multiple samplings.  Duplicate microcosms, analysed on days 66, 89 and \n116, confirmed that the microcosms could be relied on to behave reproducibly.  \nAnalysis of procedural blanks indicated that no perceptible interferences from \nmaterials with the same retention time as TNT occurred in the HPLC chromatograms.  \nIt will be observed from Fig. 2, and from the data in Table 1, that attenuation of \nTNT in the sediment-based sacrificial microcosms (SMs) was much greater than for \nthe corresponding no sediment-based LMs.  All SMs, unlike LMs, had experienced \nan initial marked fall in TNT concentrations by the time they were first sampled after \none day had elapsed.  Because this only occurred in the SMs, where sediments were \npresent, it implied that sediment was responsible for this effect.  Also, it was far \nmore pronounced for the clayey sediment than for the sandy sediment.  It seemed \nlikely, therefore, that the principal contribution to this rapid fall in TNT \nconcentrations was sorption.  TNT is known to adsorb strongly to clay minerals \n(Haderlein et al., 1996), and to sediment organic matter (Weissmahr et al., 1999).  \n12 \n \nAlso, it has been shown that these sorption processes can act very quickly for TNT \nwhen dissolved in either fresh or saline waters (Brannon et al., 2005). \nThereafter, the rates of TNT disappearance diminished.  As for the LMs, \nnon-sterile SMs produced greater attenuation of the TNT than did their sterile \ncounterparts, presumably because of the added contribution of microbially-mediated \nTNT degradation.  For the sandy sediment (Sediment B) in fed SMs, the rate of TNT \ndissipation was ca. 2.4 times faster in non-sterile microcosms (k = 0.00227 day-1) than \nin sterile microcosms (k = 0.00095 day-1).  For the clayey sediment (Sediment A) in \nunfed SMs, dissipation was ca. 2.1 times more rapid in non-sterile conditions (k = \n0.00538 day-1) than in sterile (k = 0.00261 day-1).  When the clayey SMs were fed, \nthe attenuation rate in non-sterile conditions (k = 0.00638 day-1) was again ca. 2.1 \ntimes that in sterile (k = 0.00305 day-1).  The continued loss of TNT from sterile \nmicrocosms after the initial marked sorption probably represents slower movement of \nthe sorptive process towards a steady state coupled with slow abiotic losses from \nchemical reaction, with, for example, amino compounds as discussed for the LMs. \nAs with the LMs, feeding of the SMs appeared to provide some enhancement in \nthe ability to attenuate TNT.  For practical reasons (limited incubator space \nprimarily), only fed SMs for the sandy sediment were constructed and it was assumed \nthat the fate of TNT in unfed, sandy sediment microcosms might be inferred from the \nbehaviour of the LMs (no sediment) and the SMs that were prepared using the clayey \nsediment.  Fed SMs with the clayey sediment degraded TNT somewhat more rapidly \nthan the comparable unfed SMs.  Thus, under non-sterile conditions: fed k = 0.00638 \n13 \n \nday-1 and unfed k = 0.00538 day-1 - under sterile conditions: fed k = 0.00305 day-1 and \nunfed k = 0.00261 day-1.  The slight enhancement for the abiotic removal rate of \nTNT from the fed sterile SMs, compared with the unfed sterile SMs, may possibly be \ndue to the added TNT reaction with the L-glutamic acid used as a component of the \nfeed. The more appreciable difference in rates for the non-sterile situation was \nprobably attributable to increased microbially-mediated degradation of TNT as a \nresult of feeding the microbial community. Had, therefore, unfed SMs (sterile and \nnon-sterile) been constructed employing the sandy sediment (Sediment B), it seems \nreasonable to surmise that they would have degraded somewhat more slowly than \ntheir fed counterparts.  \nBecause pseudo first order kinetics take the form: \n    ln(C0\/C) =  kt              where C0 = initial concentration\n   \n         t  =  ln(C0\/C)\/k             and C = concentration at time t \nWhen C becomes half its initial concentration then C0\/C = 2; i.e. at  t = t\u00bd \nThen     t\u00bd  =  ln(2)\/k     where t\u00bd = the half life \n   =  0.693\/k \nThe derivation of half-lives affords an easily understood, and tangible perception, of \nhow quickly the microcosms are capable of dissipating TNT (Table 1).  Half -lives \nare, of course, inversely proportional to the pseudo first-order rate constants and it \nwill be observed that they range from 109 days to 3465 days.    \n14 \n \nThere appear to be few published studies that concern the behaviour of TNT in marine \nsediment and natural seawater systems.  In certain respects, the conduct of our study \nwas comparable to that undertaken by Yost et al. 2007.  They undertook a \nconsiderably more comprehensive investigation than ours, that included details on the \nattenuation of, not only TNT, but a further ten related nitroaromatic compounds in the \npresence of three separate marine sediments, each used at a solution\/solid ratio of \n18:1.  However, they utilised an artificial, rather than a natural seawater, and then to \nproduce a salinity of only 2%.  The striking difference, though, is the much faster \ndegradation rates that they encountered compared to our study.  They quote \nhalf-lives for TNT ranging from 35 hours to 60 hours compared with our \nsediment-based results that range between 109 and 729 days.  In both this and their \nstudy, photolytic effects were eliminated by the maintenance of microcosms in the \ndark, however, Yost et al., 2007 conducted their experiments at room temperature \n(~24\u00b0C), whereas, ours were conducted at a considerably lower temperature, i.e. \n7.0\u00baC\u00b10.1\u00baC.  Also, they provided continuous agitation to their microcosms in \ncontrast to our intermittent, albeit regular shaking.  Our aim, though, was to emulate \nconditions that may be experienced in the low intertidal, subtidal and neritic zones of \nthe North Sea during winter, where limited to zero contact between sediment and \nseawater, (as simulated by the SMs and LMs, respectively), may be anticipated.  In \nthis context, attenuation of TNT would, on the basis of our results, appear to be very \nslow.  Comparison of our work with theirs, clearly illustrates that differences in \n15 \n \ntemperature and sediment\/seawater contact exert considerable influence over the \nattenuation behaviour of the TNT in seawater.  \nThe half-lives we have recorded accord with observations that have been made \nconcerning the hydrolysis of TNT by seawater (Hoffsommer & Rosen, 1973). In their \nstudy it was discovered that a filtered, concentrated solution of TNT in seawater (95 \nmg\/l) - from an unspecified location - maintained at ca. 25\u00b0C and kept in actinic glass \nto preclude photolysis, produced 0% loss of TNT over a 108 day period.  \nThe photolytic degradation of TNT by sunlight was not considered and it should be \nborne in mind that this would contribute significantly to the overall attenuation of \nTNT in clear shallow waters.  It was observed, when the intertidal seawater was \ncollected, that it possessed a degree of turbidity; a common feature of coastal \nseawaters (Aarup, 2002).  Though some of this settled on standing, a large \nproportion remained in suspension (i.e. was colloidal or was of neutral buoyancy).  \nLight is reduced to 1% of its surface intensity after penetrating ca. 10 m into a typical \ncoastal seawater (Sumich & Morrissey, 2004).  This turbidity would serve to \ndiminish substantially the contribution of photolysis to the degradation of TNT. \n \n4. Conclusions \n \n The study aimed in essence to be a focused and simplistic assessment of the \nability of seawater, either with or without sediment present, to attenuate TNT.  The \nNorth Sea coast of the UK, and its waters, have numerous sites at which UXO, \n16 \n \nincluding TNT, may potentially cause contamination problems.  Accordingly, the \nrate of TNT attenuation is an important factor for gauging the effect of UXO pollution \non littoral benthic organisms.  The study sought to emulate conservative conditions \nand so coastal seawater winter temperatures were chosen together with limited \nagitation of sediments.  Under such conditions, TNT was found to dissipate very \nslowly. This is in marked contrast to its rate of attenuation, with a variety of stirred \nsediments, in artificial seawater at ca. 24\u00b0C (Yost et al., 2007).  In our study, the \nhalf-life of TNT in seawater not in contact with sediment was ca. 1900 days.  In the \npresence of a sandy sediment the half-life was estimated to fall to <700 days and this \nwas further reduced to about 130 days when a clayey sediment was present.  Both \nmicrobial degradation and sorption were found to contribute to the attenuation.  \nSupplying extra carbon sources to the indigenous microbial community had a slight \nenhancing effect on TNT biodegradation.       \n \nReferences \n \nAarup, T. 2002 Transparency of the North Sea and Baltic Sea - a Secchi depth data \nmining study.
