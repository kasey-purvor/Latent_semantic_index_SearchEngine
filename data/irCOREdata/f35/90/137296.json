Introduction\nSubsidies awarded by regional and national governments to air carriers within the\nEuropean Union are allowed within the framework of Article 4 of Council Regulation\n* Corresponding author. Fax:0044 (0) 1234 752207, E-mail: g.williams@cranfield.ac.uk\n22408\/92 (CEC 1992), which came into effect on January 1st 1993. Under the\naforementioned regulation, EU member states and two EFTA1 countries (Iceland,\nNorway) have the legal authority to impose a public service obligation (PSO) and award\nfinancial compensation (subsidy) to an air carrier operating scheduled services. PSOs\ncan be imposed by member states on a route between two airports within their territorial\njurisdiction or an airport within their jurisdiction and an airport in another member state.\nPublic service obligations are imposed where adequate provision of air services in terms\nof regularity of service, capacity and pricing is not possible if carriers are solely taking\ntheir own commercial considerations into account. The rationale for imposing a PSO is\nto sustain air services to remote regions for economic development purposes.\nEight EU member states (France, Germany, Irish Republic, Italy, Portugal, Spain,\nSweden, UK) and Iceland and Norway currently impose public service obligations, the\nvast majority of which are on domestic routes. Cross-border PSOs are imposed in\nrelation to several routes from Strasbourg, services between Erfurt in Germany and\nBrussels, and between Derry in Northern Ireland (UK) and Dublin in the Irish Republic.\nTo date, there has been comparatively little research published on the subject of the PSO\nsystem or on broader social air services subsidy policy issues. Some countries such as\nFrance, the Irish Republic and Norway have had several years experience administering\nPSOs. There is considerable scope therefore to investigate whether the system has\nworked favourably and to identify the extent to which administrative authorities, small\ncommunity stakeholders and air carriers have experienced difficulties in coping with the\nlegislative parameters set by the PSO system. The number of PSOs in operation has\nexpanded considerably since the very first tenders were issued in the Irish Republic. By\n1 European Free Trade Association\n3the end of 1997 there were 64 PSO routes in operation, 42 of them in France. By\nSeptember 2001, the total number of PSOs had expanded to 164.\nIt is clear that the PSO mechanism has become increasingly used. It is therefore timely to\ncompare and contrast the way PSOs have been adopted by different countries. The\nfollowing section provides a brief introduction to the issue with references to past\nliterature on the subject. Section 3 contrasts the extent to which different countries have\nadopted the PSO system. A discussion of the different ways in which PSOs have been\nadopted in terms of minimum service level specifications and issues relating to the setting\nof maximum air fares and subsidy levels are discussed in Sections 4 and 5. Section 6\nassesses the different attitudes towards PSOs prevailing in different countries and where\nand how the line is drawn between a PSO route and a non-PSO route. The paper\nconcludes with some recommendations as to how the PSO mechanism could be improved\nupon and includes a brief outline of further research possibilities. A map showing the\nprecise locations of airports and communities cited in this paper is contained in Appendix\nA.\nInformation on specific requirements (capacity, fares, frequency, aircraft size, etc) for\nPSO tenders are published in editions of the Official Journal of the European\nCommunities. For the purposes of this paper these editions were gathered electronically\nfrom the Eurolaw website 2.\n2. Background\n2 www.ili.co.uk\n4Individual member states, through the relevant central government department have the\nlegal authority to impose PSOs. PSOs can be awarded, administered and subsidised by\neither regional or national governments, either directly or through associated agencies.\nThe process involves initially issuing an invitation to tender which must be published in\nthe Official Journal of the European Communities. Once awarded, a carrier is granted a\nmonopoly on the route for a period not exceeding three years. The tender usually\nstipulates minimum service levels and maximum fares that contracted air carriers need to\nsatisfy for the duration of the contract. There are two tender rounds. The initial tender\nasks for submissions from air carriers who are able to operate services and meet the\ntender specifications without subsidy. If no carrier is willing to offer a subsidy-free\noperation, a second tender is issued which invites carriers to bid on the basis of receiving\na subsidy. The awarding authority then makes a decision taking into account the level of\nsubvention demanded, levels of service offered and any other relevant considerations. In\nIceland, the Irish Republic, Portugal, Norway and Sweden (through the National Public\nTransport Agency) national governments are responsible for administering PSOs. In\nFrance, Germany, Italy and Spain, regional authorities administer PSOs. In the UK,\nwhere PSOs are only operated in Scotland, the Scottish Executive is responsible for\nadministering the Glasgow PSOs while regional authorities (Orkney, Shetland, Western\nIsles) administer the others.\nOutside of the EEA, the United States since 1978 has operated a system of subsidising air\nservices to small communities administered centrally by the Department of\nTransportation (DoT) called the Essential Air Services Programme (EAS). The EAS\nsystem currently serves 114 communities with an annual budget of around US$113\nmillion. In contrast to the EU approach, which allows for regional (member state)\nsubsidiarity in deciding on which routes should be subsidised, the EAS programme sets\n5out those communities that are eligible to have subsidised air services on the basis of\ndistance from the nearest large, medium, small and non-hub commercial airport\n(Reynolds-Feighan, 1999). The Secretary of Transportation determines the level of\nservice for each remote community. If a service is not being provided on a commercial\nbasis, the DoT invites carriers to tender and specify the level of subsidy required. In\ncontrast to the PSO scheme, a second carrier that is able to offer subsidy-free services can\nenter the market. In these circumstances, the DoT gives notice to the incumbent that the\nsubsidy is to be withdrawn and the incumbent then has the choice of operating services\nwithout subsidy or discontinuing services. According to Reynolds-Feighan (1996), this\nprovision for market entry provides incentives for minimising subsidy levels. The EAS\nlimits the level of subsidy to US$200 per passenger.\nThe robustness of the EAS system has been strongly tested since the events of September\n11, 2001 as air carriers in the United States have been reducing service levels particularly\nto small communities. This trend has been exacerbated by low cost carriers which have\nincreased their services at medium and large-size hub airports, thereby adversely\naffecting traffic levels at small airports within the same catchment area (ATI, 2003).\nAccording to ATI (2003), critics argue that the EAS eligibility criteria remains too\nrestrictive and is subject to differing interpretation. For example, the DoT rejected the\ncommunity of Lancaster\u2019s application for EAS subsidy because it was deemed to be 65.3\nmiles from Pennsylvania calculated on the basis of the shortest distance using small roads\nrather than the most commonly used road 3.\nIn the first published critique of Article 4 of Regulation 2408\/92, Reynolds-Feighan\n(1995) argued that the European Commission (EC) should consider adopting some of the\n3 EAS eligibility criteria currently prohibits the DoT from subsidising air services to airports that are\nlocated within 70 miles of the nearest medium or large sized hub airport.\n6features of the EAS system. The author identified two key deficiencies in the PSO\nsystem, one relating to member state-level administration of PSOs and the other the\nexistence of barriers to entry. Administration of PSOs by individual member states is\ncriticised on the basis that there has been an inconsistent application of the PSO\ninstrument across the EU leading to imbalances in the level and provision of air services\nto small communities. Reynolds-Feighan (1995) argued that a centralised EU-level\nprogramme would lead to a more transparent process and greater efficiency in the\nmatching of funds to regional needs.\nIt was also noted that the regulation does not deal with the payment of subsidies for\nproposed service levels that are an improvement on or are in addition to the minimum\nlevels stipulated in the tender. Member-state level administration of PSOs, which to\nsome extent can be justified on the grounds of the widely differing geographical, social\nand economic conditions prevailing between countries, is often subject to strong local\npolitical pressures, which can result in highly-subjective, politically-motivated decision-\nmaking. The result can be the imposition of an excessive number of PSOs that bear little\nrelation to issues of peripherality, economic development and the availability of\nalternative transportation services. Sletten (2001) claimed that there were examples of\nstrong political pressures being exerted by regional lobby groups in the development of\nNorway\u2019s PSOs during the 1990s.\nBarriers to entry are evident within the PSO system. One particular challenge faced by\nPSO administering authorities is in ensuring that bidding processes are sufficiently\ncompetitive. The problem for many potential new entrants is that there can be significant\nsunk costs associated with operating PSO services particularly given that the contracted\nair carrier is awarded a monopoly on a route for only three years. This may partly\nexplain why in some of the more remote low traffic-density PSO markets, long-\n7established local air carriers such as Wider\u00f8e Flyvesselskap in Norway and Loganair in\nScotland continue to dominate their national PSO markets. Interestingly, the Norwegian\ngovernment, which issued new tenders in 2002 for its PSO routes, received special\ndispensation from the European Commission (through the EFTA Surveillance Authority\n4) to offer tenders in the form of packages rather than on an individual basis. This was\ndone to allow air carriers to achieve economies of scale in the operation of the subsidised\nair services. The Norwegian government reportedly received bids from seven carriers,\nbut it was not specified how many bids were received for each PSO package (ATI 2002a).\nThe recently released Irish government PSO tenders for services from Dublin to Donegal,\nGalway, Kerry, Knock and Sligo reportedly received bids from three airlines, two Irish-\nregistered (Aer Arann and Euroceltic) and one Danish (Newair) (ATI 2002b). Aer Arran,\nwhich held the previous tender for all the routes, lost two of them (Donegal, Sligo) to\nEuroceltic. This would tend to suggest that it is possible for PSO tenders to be\ncompetitive. However, Euroceltic was declared bankrupt at the beginning of 2003 and\nAer Arann is once again operating the two routes.\nAnother potential entry barrier arises as a result of there being only one month allowed to\nlapse between notification of the tender and the submission of bids. Within this time\nframe, air carriers face the challenge, in addition to preparing proposals, of securing\nsuitable aircraft to operate on the route. According to Sletten (2001), this can be\nparticularly difficult in the STOL market. For example, in the year 2000 Norwegian PSO\ntender, one carrier stated that it could identify only eight DHC-8 aircraft that were\navailable. Furthermore, all of them needed expensive engine conversions and only two\ncould be guaranteed for delivery at the start of the PSO contract (April 2000).\n4 Body set up to monitor implementation of obligations by EFTA countries which are signatories to the\nAgreement on the European Economic Area. Norway and Iceland have both signed up to and adopted\nCouncil Regulation 2408\/92.\n8While there appears to exist considerable scope for reform, it is beyond the aims of this\npaper to consider these issues in greater depth. The focus here is to contrast the ways in\nwhich countries have made use of the PSO mechanism.\n3. Extent of PSO coverage\nAs far as assessing the extent to which countries have made use of the PSO mechanism is\nconcerned, Table 1 lists the number of PSO routes operational in September 2001 in the\ndomestic scheduled markets of each EU member and EEA signatory state.\nNorway has the largest number of PSO routes followed by France. In the former case,\nthe majority of routes are located in the North of the country on services linking remote\ncommunities. In France, most of the PSOs are imposed on routes between a number of\nsmall regional airports (e.g. Brest, Roanne, Rodez) and Paris, and between major cities on\nthe French mainland (Marseille, Nice, Paris) and airports on the Island of Corsica\n(Ajaccio, Bastia, Calvi and Figari). Skreikes (2003) explains that the reason why France\nhas imposed a large number of PSOs is mainly due to a strong commitment within France\nboth at national and regional level to connect the regions to Paris for economic\ndevelopment purposes.\nIn Spain the thirteen PSOs are all currently imposed on inter-Canary Island services,\nwhile the ten PSO routes in Portugal have been imposed on services linking the mainland\nwith the Azores and Madeira, and on one mainland service (Lisbon-Villa Real-\nBragan\u00e7a). In the UK, all twelve PSOs are imposed on internal Scottish routes covering\nservices within the Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands and Western Isles, and on services\nfrom Glasgow to Barra, Campbeltown and Tiree. In September 2001, Sweden had one\nPSO route (Umea-Ostersund), but a further ten new tenders were issued in 2002, most of\nthem on routes linking various regional airports (Gallivare, Torsby etc) with Stockholm.\n9In the Irish Republic, all domestic scheduled routes, with the exceptions of Dublin-\nShannon and Dublin-Cork, have PSOs imposed on them. As for Germany, in September\n2001, there were five PSO routes, all of them linking airports in the East (Erfurt, Hof,\nBayreuth) with Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg and Cologne\/Bonn.\nFigure 1 provides a measure of the scope of PSO coverage in each country by showing\nthe proportion of total domestic scheduled seating capacity in September 2001 accounted\nfor by PSO routes.\nIn Portugal, PSO routes account for 40% of total domestic seating capacity. This is\nexplained by the deployment of large capacity aircraft on routes linking the mainland and\nthe Azores and Madeira. France, Norway and Scotland have very similar levels\n(approximately 10%), while the proportion of domestic seats accounted for by PSOs in\nGermany, Iceland and Sweden is relatively insignificant. It should be noted, however,\nthat there has been a very recent expansion in the number of German PSO routes (e.g.\nRostock to Frankfurt and Munich) and the imposition of ten new PSOs in Sweden.\nFigure 2 contrasts average sector distance on PSO routes. The effect of the relatively\nlong-haul mainland-island PSOs on the Portuguese average is apparent. In France, PSO\nroutes are generally associated with relatively long sector-distances, particularly on\nroutes between Paris and Corsica. By contrast, in the majority of cases, in Norway,\nScotland and Spain (Canary Islands), PSOs have been imposed on very short-sector\ndistance routes. This is particularly apparent on several of the Scottish intra-island routes\nwhere flying times are of the order of ten to fifteen minutes.\nFigure 3 contrasts the average seating capacity per flight between countries. These\nresults are to a large extent a function of both sector distance and traffic density. Aircraft\nwith relatively high seating capacities operate the majority of French, Italian and\n10\nPortuguese PSOs. On the Italian PSOs for example, which link Rome and Milan to\nairports in Sardinia, the tenders stipulate a requirement that the contracted air carrier\noperate jet aircraft. Scottish PSO flights have an average seating capacity of only twelve\nas they are imposed mainly on routes associated with very short sector distances and low\ntraffic volumes. On Irish and Norwegian PSOs, turboprop aircraft with seating capacities\nin the region of thirty to fifty seats (Dash 8-100, ATR-42) are deployed.\n4. Minimum service levels\nAll PSOs in operation in September 2001 required the operator to satisfy fixed levels of\nservice for the duration of the contract. In the majority of tenders, the air carrier is\nrequired to meet a minimum level of service frequency and \/ or a minimum level of\nseating capacity to be supplied over a specific period of time (day, week, month). Levels\nof service are established on the basis of what the administering authority considers to be\nappropriate service standards on each route given the volume of traffic and sector\ndistance. For example, some routes in Scotland, such as Glasgow-Campbeltown, have a\nminimum requirement for two weekday round trips, while on Lerwick-Papa Stour\n(Shetland Islands), a route with much lower traffic, the minimum requirement is for two\nreturn trips on a Thursday. There may also be requirements related to the minimum size\nof aircraft and to the timetabling of services. Table 2 lists the various service level\nrequirements contained in each country\u2019s PSOs.\nAll Scottish PSOs stipulate a minimum level of service frequency, with only the Glasgow\nroutes containing specific minimum capacity requirements. The only exceptions to the\nminimum frequency requirement is to be found in the Canary Islands, where most routes\ncontain minimum levels of seating capacity rather than service frequency. Here and in\nother regions where there are significant seasonal fluctuations in traffic (e.g. French\n11\nmainland - Corsica, Italian Mainland - Sardinia) there are separate capacity requirements\nfor both winter and summer seasons.\nCarriers are often required to deploy aircraft with a minimum seating capacity, while in\nsome countries only pressurised equipment must be used (e.g. Norway). Aircraft size\nrequirements are to a significant extent driven by airfield operational limits, which\nrestrict both the size and type of aircraft. For example, for services within the Orkney\nand Shetland islands in Scotland, the nine-seat BN Islander aircraft is the only\ncommercial aircraft that can operate from the very short airstrips. In Norway, the\nrequirement that carriers operate pressurised aircraft was to a large extent driven by\npolitical pressure from regional lobby groups.\nTimetabling requirements feature in many PSO tenders. This is because the\nadministering authority is seeking to ensure that schedules offered are as convenient as\npossible to the general public. For example, allowing passengers to complete a day trip\nto and from their destination and the ability to make convenient onward connections.\nThe requirement can be fairly detailed as in the case of German PSOs where services\nfrom Erfurt to both Munich and Berlin are required to arrive and depart within specific\ntime-intervals. In France, it is fairly common for PSO tenders to stipulate that passengers\nshould be able to spend at least seven, eight or nine hours at their destination before being\nable to return home. In the Irish Republic, the PSOs demand that there should be an early\nmorning departure from the regional airport (Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo) to\nDublin and a return flight from Dublin at the end of the day. At slot-constrained airports\nin France, Germany and Italy, member state governments have exercised their right to\n12\nreserve take-off and landing slots for PSO services under provisions contained in EC slot\nregulation 95\/93 (CEC, 1993) 5.\nThe specification of timetabling requirements has implications regarding both the\npositioning and utilisation of aircraft and therefore the overall costs of the operation and\nlevel of subsidy. Allowing air carriers the freedom to set their own timetables and adjust\nthem on the basis of market conditions will have cost advantages. However, the\ndifficulty with allowing carriers freedom in this regard is that while service frequency\nmay be adequate, timings of services may be unsuitable, with passengers often being\nforced to spend an overnight stay at their destination or being unable to connect with\nonward flights from the main hub airport. Table 3 contrasts minimum service levels on a\nselection of PSO routes.\nDifferences highlighted in this sample of routes serve to illustrate disparities in the way\nPSOs are used by countries, reflecting different priorities and broader differences in the\nextent to which governments are prepared to intervene in the market to secure regional,\neconomic and social policy goals. For example, on the Glasgow-Barra PSO a minimum\nlevel of service frequency and daily capacity is stipulated, but there is no timetabling\nrequirement. By contrast, the Irish government specifies a level of frequency, capacity\nand aircraft type on the Dublin-Donegal PSO. Timetabling requirements are stipulated in\nthe PSOs for Epinal-Paris Orly and Cologne\/Bonn-Erfurt. Although in the former case,\nno specific times or time intervals are set, the PSO tender requires that schedules are\nestablished which guarantee at least eight hours at the destination.\nThe requirements set by PSO administering authorities are to a large extent driven by\nhow far policy-makers are prepared to intervene through subsidies in the market to secure\na specific level of service and fare. For example, Scottish PSO minimum service levels\n5 Article 9\n13\nappear to be relatively more relaxed than in some other countries. This may be a\nreflection of an instinctively less interventionist approach by both the Scottish Executive\nand UK government. A more restrictive scheduling requirement may inflate the level of\nsubsidy required and be an additional barrier to entry thereby reducing the\ncompetitiveness of the PSO tendering process. In some other countries, the levels of\ncomplexity contained in PSO minimum service requirements are greater, in particular, on\nFrench Mainland-Corsica PSOs and to a slightly lesser extent on those imposed in\nNorway.\n5. Regulating the cost of travel and level of subsidy\nMost PSO tenders require operators to set air fares within a limit specified by the\nadministering authority. The only major exceptions are in France where most of the\nmainland PSOs exclude any such requirement. Table 4 provides details on the approach\nto regulating fares within PSO contracts in different countries.\nIn Scotland, all PSOs stipulate a maximum one-way unrestricted economy fare. These\nrange from \u20ac156 on Glasgow-Barra to \u20ac24 on Kirkwall to North Ronaldsay and Papa\nWestray services. The Shetland Island PSOs have a fare limit of between \u20ac26 and \u20ac60.\nThere are no special fare discounts offered to categories of passengers on any of the\nScottish PSO routes.\nFare restrictions are also applied on all the Irish PSO routes. Each PSO has unrestricted\nreturn fare limits of between \u20ac111 and \u20ac124. The operating carrier is required to make\navailable a proportion of seats at these air fares. For example, on Dublin-Kerry, out of\nthe minimum level of seats required throughout the day, sixty must be offered at \u20ac111,\nsixty at \u20ac124 and the remaining thirty can be offered at a fare of the airline\u2019s choosing.\nHowever, there are currently no special discounts for specific categories of passenger.\n14\nIn Germany, air carriers which have been awarded PSOs on services from Erfurt cannot\nexceed \u20ac82 + \u20ac0.25 per km for a single fare. On the Hof-Bayreuth-Frankfurt PSO, the air\ncarrier is not permitted to set a fare that exceeds the price of a single fare on Nuremberg-\nFrankfurt by 5%.\nThe vast majority of PSOs operating in Italy, Portugal and Spain are on routes linking\nmainland airports with island communities. On Italian and Portuguese PSOs and those\nlinking the French mainland and Corsica, carriers are required to offer special discounts\nor low fares to island residents. For example, on services between the Portuguese\nmainland and the Madeira airports (Funchal, Porto Santo), residents of the islands and\nstudents studying on the mainland are eligible for a 40% discount. Other discounts are\nalso available on services between the mainland and the Azores. However, it should be\nnoted that air services are the only means of travel to and from the mainland as there are\nno ferry services. In Italy, where there are a network of PSOs linking Sardinian airports\n(Alghero, Cagliari, Olbia) with both Rome and Milan, there exists a maximum fare limit\napplicable to all passengers. However, there are also special lower fares which are\noffered to Sardinian residents, Sardinian immigrants living on the mainland, the disabled,\nstudents and persons aged under 25 and over 70. A similar approach exists on the\nFrench Mainland-Corsican routes where there is a maximum fare and a discounted lower\nfare, which is offered to various categories of passenger.\nThe extent of regulatory complexity in the PSO tender and the scale and degree to which\nfares are capped will determine the level of subsidy required to meet the contracted air\ncarrier\u2019s operating deficit. Table 5 provides data on levels of subsidy awarded on PSO\ncontracts in different countries for the year 2000.\n15\nDifferences in the aggregate level of subsidy are to a large extent directly correlated to\nthe volume of passenger traffic and the number of PSO routes. Subsidy levels range from\n\u20ac46 million awarded in Norway to just \u20ac0.6 million in Sweden. There are also marked\nvariations in the average level of subsidy per passenger. The average subsidy per\npassenger on the Erfurt PSOs was \u20ac136 in 2000. Average per passenger subsidy levels\nin Scotland, Norway and Sweden are broadly the same, while the lowest levels of subsidy\nper passenger were on PSOs in France, the Irish Republic and Portugal where traffic\nvolumes are higher and unit operating costs lower.\nTable 6 compares the average subsidy per passenger of selected PSOs by route, or group\nof routes, in France, the Irish Republic, Norway and the UK. It is apparent that there are\nnot only significant differences between countries but also within countries in levels of\naverage subsidy per passenger. For example, PSO air service networks on the Scottish\nIslands of Orkney and Shetland are very similar in terms of sector distance. However,\nthe average subsidy per passenger awarded in Shetland (\u20ac83) is over double that in\nOrkney (\u20ac40). This difference may be due to the fact that traffic volumes on Shetland\ninter-island services are two thirds that of Orkney, which would allow for better\nutilisation of aircraft and economies of scale. The Vard\u00f8-Kirkenes PSO in Norway has\nsimilarities with both Orkney and Shetland in terms of capacity offered and sector\ndistance. Yet the average subsidy in 2000 was \u20ac173 per passenger, which is double that\nof Shetland. It is probable that part of the differences were accounted for by the\nrelatively high costs associated with operating the Dornier 228 on the Vard\u00f8-Kirkenes\nPSO compared to the Britten-Norman Islander, which is used on the inter-island services\nin Orkney and Shetland. However, differences in the maximum fares that can be charged\nare highly significant. The maximum one-way fare, which can be levied on Vard\u00f8-\n16\nKirkenes, is \u20ac68 compared to \u20ac61 on the Shetland services, in spite of the fact that\noperating costs appear to be much higher on the Norwegian route.\nA comparison of the traffic volumes and maximum fare levels set on the busiest PSO\nroutes in France, the Irish Republic, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Scotland\nand Sweden in 2001 is given in Tables 7 and 8. It is apparent that the PSOs linking\nFrance, Italy and Portugal with their respective island communities have high volumes of\ntraffic. For example, the average number of passengers on the four routes from Paris to\nCorsica is approximately 200,000, a level that would imply commercial viability under\nmost operating conditions.\nWhile the range of minimum service requirements and limits on fare are key influencing\nfactors, the level of subsidy on a PSO will also be influenced by how competitive the\nPSO tendering process is. The total level of subsidy in Norway for the tenders issued in\n2000 was 15% higher than in 1997, mainly due to the lack of competing tender proposals\nbeing submitted (Sletten, 2001). This may be due to the existence of entry barriers, in\nparticular, the risk of incurring high sunk costs as a result of operating groups of routes in\nNorway. It is also significant that so few examples exist of carriers from other countries\noperating such services. The only example of a PSO route from these three countries that\nis not operated by a local carrier is Dublin-Derry, which is served by the Scottish airline\nLoganair.\nA number of factors influence the amount of subsidy that will be required to operate a\ngiven PSO service. The costs of operating a route will be strongly affected by the size\nand type of aircraft to be used. An older, unpressurised aircraft, such as a Shorts 360,\nwill invariably be less expensive to run than a regional jet, for example. The route length,\navailable airport infrastructure, the volume and seasonal nature of the traffic, and the type\n17\nof route will determine the choice of aircraft to be employed. Operations to small islands\nsuch as those in the west of Ireland are really only feasible with small aircraft seating\nfewer than ten passengers. In other circumstances, a trade off will exist between service\nfrequency and aircraft size. On a given route, for example, using a 19 seat aircraft may\nmake it possible to offer three flights per day, whereas use of a more sophisticated 50\nseater may restrict operations to once daily. The nature of the route will also affect the\nschedule to be provided. It may be that a service links an outlying island with a regional\ncentre, in which case the traffic will be mostly point-to-point. In other instances, the\nservice will be providing feeder traffic to connect with other regional operations.\nTo demonstrate the strange mix that is apparent between EU countries, two PSO routes\nare contrasted below. Information about the two operations is contained in Table 9. It is\ninteresting to note that it is the more heavily trafficked route between Dublin and\nDonegal that has the higher subsidy. The Scottish route from Glasgow to the Hebridean\nisland of Tiree with around half the traffic of the Irish example requires 45% less subsidy.\nBoth routes have a service once a day during the week, with load factors in the low 40s.\nThe Donegal service was operated by Aer Arann until recently with a Shorts 360 aircraft,\nequipped with 36 seats. This has subsequently been upgraded to a 50 seat ATR 42,\nproviding a more comfortable journey for passengers. A much smaller and less\nsophisticated aircraft, the unpressurised De Havilland Twin Otter, equipped with 19 seats,\nprovides the service to Tiree. The use of this aircraft by Loganair is to a large extent\ninfluenced by their PSO operation to the island of Barra. The airstrip at Barra is the\ncockleshell beach at Castlebay, to which the Twin Otter is ideally suited. Attempts to use\na larger, heavier aircraft on this service have not proved successful. Hence, the Tiree\noperation remains in the hands of the Twin Otter.\n18\nFare levels are of key significance in explaining the differing levels of subsidy. On the\nDublin-Donegal route, the maximum return fare was set at \u20ac108 whilst the equivalent\nprice for the Glasgow-Tiree service was close to double this level at \u20ac240. In terms of\nsubsidy per single passenger journey, the Tiree operation was a little more expensive.\nWithout the higher fare however, the level of subsidy would have been much greater. It is\nclear that the Irish Government is more generous in providing subsidies for essential air\nservices than is the Scottish Executive.\n6. PSO vs non-PSO: where do national governments draw the line?\nOne very important point to be made regarding the application of PSOs in the European\nUnion is that national governments appear to have very different notions of which routes\ndeserve to have PSO regulatory protection and associated subsidy and those that do not.\nNorway is similar to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in terms of topography and to\nsome extent population size and density. While the Norwegian government has made\nextensive use of PSOs not only in the remoter regions of the country, in Scotland, most of\nthe PSOs have been imposed on very low volume, short sector distance routes located in\nperipheral regions. The only routes involving the mainland are those from Glasgow to\nBarra, Campbeltown and Tiree. Other lifeline links that are equally vital strategically and\neconomically, such as Orkney-Aberdeen and Shetland-Aberdeen, are however excluded\nfrom the PSO regime. These apparent inconsistencies in government policy can be\nillustrated by contrasting services between Aberdeen and Sumburgh (Shetland) with\ncomparable PSO routes in other countries.\nAberdeen-Sumburgh is served three times daily with a 64-seat ATP aircraft operated by\nBritish Airways Citiexpress, while Oslo-F\u00f8rde is served five times daily with a 37-seat\nDash 8-100 operated by Wider\u00f8e Flyvesselskap. The overall level of weekly capacity\n19\nbetween the two routes is therefore broadly similar. If one measures peripherality in\nterms of provision of surface transport services, then in both cases, travellers would face\nthe alternative of considerably more lengthy journeys using alternative transport modes.\nIn the Norwegian case, the only alternative to the F\u00f8rde-Oslo PSO air service is a once a\nday thirteen-hour journey by coach. The alternative to travelling by air between\nAberdeen and the Shetland Islands is a daily fourteen-hour voyage by sea, a trip often\nsubject to delay as a result of adverse weather conditions especially during the winter\nmonths. However, in spite of the fact that air transport offers much more convenient\naccess between Aberdeen and Sumburgh, the Scottish Executive and UK Government\nhas chosen not to impose a PSO. In Norway the government has chosen to do otherwise\non a similar route. As a consequence, pricing and output (capacity, frequency, aircraft\nsize) decisions on Aberdeen-Shetland are subject to the commercial imperatives of the\noperator, while minimum service levels and maximum fares between Oslo and F\u00f8rde are\ndetermined by the Norwegian government. In the North of Scotland, there is a campaign\ncurrently being waged by local stakeholders to extend the scope of PSOs in the face of a\nvery strong perception amongst the general public that fares on non-PSO air services\nbetween peripheral regions and the mainland are very high. There is also an opinion\nwidely expressed amongst stakeholders that lower fares will encourage greater mobility,\nthereby reversing recent declines in traffic levels on a number of routes (Press & Journal,\n2002).\nIn many cases the line between PSO and non-PSO designation is arbitrary and often the\nproduct of how successful regional lobby groups have been at influencing national\npolicy. Such decisions rest strongly on whether a government\u2019s aviation policy is\ninherently interventionist or market-orientated. Differences in approach are very\napparent when the attitudes to PSOs of decision-makers in both Scotland and the UK as a\n20\nwhole are compared with those prevailing in France. The route linking Nice and Figari\n(Corsica), for example, can be compared with Aberdeen-Sumburgh in terms of distance,\nfrequency, aircraft size and overall capacity. Both services link airports on the respective\nmainland with island communities. The French air service however is subsidised while\nthe comparable Scottish route is not. At the behest of the Corsican regional authorities\nFrance has imposed a PSO on the Nice-Figari route, with minimum levels of service\nrequirements and maximum fares stipulated. Several other routes linking Corsica with\nmainland cities also have PSO status. It is apparent the French authorities have made\nextensive use of PSOs, even where traffic volumes on some of the routes would appear to\nbe at a level that would normally imply commercial viability. For example, Paris-Ajaccio\nhandled 382,654 passengers in 2000. The impetus for imposing PSOs has come mainly\nfrom regional authorities and local chambers of commerce who are of the view that\nregular, convenient and affordable air service links to Paris are a social and economic\nimperative.\nThe Dublin-Kerry PSO route in the Irish Republic is also very similar to Aberdeen-\nSumburgh, in terms of sector distance, traffic volume, capacity and frequency offered.\nThe key point however in this case is that Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands is more\nperipheral relative to Aberdeen, than Kerry is to Dublin. Whilst it takes approximately\nfour hours to travel by train from Killarney (County Kerry) to Dublin, it takes some\nfourteen hours to travel by sea from Aberdeen to Lerwick (Shetland Islands).\nOne problem highlighted by regional stakeholders in the Highlands and Islands of\nScotland is the fact that the motivations for expanding the scope of PSOs have more to do\nwith achieving affordable airfares and improved flight times, rather than simply\nmaintaining access. While some low-density peripheral routes are being provided\ncommercially they are subject to constraints imposed by aircraft scheduling, resulting in\n21\nflight timings that make day-trips either impossible or very difficult to achieve. A PSO\ncould address this problem by stipulating departure and arrival times, as well as service\nfrequency. The affordability of air travel has become a key policy issue in the Highlands\nand Islands of Scotland where there is growing anecdotal evidence of comparatively high\nfares (Press & Journal, 2002). If demand were sufficiently price elastic, subsidy levels\nneed not be high.\nClearly, the result of member-state level designation of PSOs is that significant\nimbalances exist in the provision of air services to small communities between different\nregions across the EU (Reynolds-Feighan, 1995). As a consequence, EU-level\nadministration of PSOs has been suggested as an alternative to the existing regime,\nwhereby PSOs would be adopted on the basis of common and transparent criteria as\nexists in the US Essential Air Services Programme. The current PSO system incorporates\nan element of subsidiarity in decision-making. This is achieved through, on the one hand,\nestablishing a common EU-wide legal framework to administer PSOs, with, on the other\nhand, issues such as which routes should be subsidised and how much subsidy should be\npaid, being left to the discretion of member states who make decisions on the basis of\ntheir own economic and regional policy goals. However, by granting member states this\ndiscretion, imbalances in provision, affordability and access do occur and may run\ncounter to broader EC social, economic and regional policy objectives. For example, the\nEuropean Commission has made various long-term policy commitments to enhancing\neconomic and social cohesion across the Union. Central to achieving this aim must be to\nhave a sustainable transport strategy which is able to deliver enhanced mobility and\naccess between peripheral regions and major economic and political decision-making\ncentres. A fully transparent and non-discriminatory EU-level administered social air\nservices programme would to some extent assist in the attainment of these broader\n22\neconomic and social aspirations. Greater mobility and accessibility for communities\nlocated in peripheral regions cannot be achieved universally by leaving key decisions to\nindividual member states, as these will be influenced significantly by the degree to which\nregional interests are able to exert influence over national government policy.\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper has highlighted differences in terms of the degree to which member states\nhave adopted the PSO mechanism in respect of air transport services. Countries such as\nFrance and Norway have made extensive use of PSOs. In the case of Norway, this is\nmainly due to the fact that there are many small communities located in remote regions\nwhere air transport is the only viable means of public transport. By contrast, in France\nsome of the routes that have been given PSO status have convenient surface transport\nalternatives and some have large traffic volumes. Germany is increasingly making use of\nthe PSO mechanism, with regional governments using PSOs as part of a broader\neconomic strategy to achieve a greater degree of integration between East and West\nGerman economies. In all three of the above-mentioned countries, national government\npolicy-makers appear to be more receptive to regional political pressures than in the UK\nwhere intensive lobbying by regional stakeholders in the Highlands and Islands has failed\nto persuade both the national government and the Scottish Executive to expand the scope\nof the PSO mechanism to other routes.\nAs a result of a less than enthusiastic view of the role of PSOs in air transport, the system\nhas not been adopted to the same extent in the UK as it has been in other countries (UK\nDETR, 1999). This is in spite of the fact that many communities located in peripheral\nregions have faced problems of maintaining conveniently timed and affordable air\nservices, which to some extent could have been ameliorated through the use of PSOs.\n23\nGiven, differences in member states\u2019 attitudes and approaches toward PSOs, and the\nconsequent imbalances in the provision of air services, there are convincing arguments\nfor centralising the administration and funding of PSOs at EU-level. This, in theory at\nleast, could result in a more efficient and equitable distribution of subsidy, and a greater\ndegree of consistency with broader EU economic, social and regional development goals.\nAn investigation of the price elasticities of demand for air travel between various\nperipheral communities and their corresponding economic centres would be required if\nsuch an approach were to be adopted. How an EU-level system could be implemented is\nbeyond the scope of the paper, but would also form a useful topic for research.\n24\nReferences\nATI.
