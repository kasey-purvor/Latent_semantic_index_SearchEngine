Conjugacy of these\nsubalgebras is established for a large class of solvable lie algebras.\nMathematics Subject Classification 2000: 17B05, 17B20, 17B30, 17B50.\nKey Words and Phrases: Lie algebras, complemented, solvable, Frat-\ntini ideal, prefrattini subalgebra, residual.\n1 Complements of subalgebra intervals\nThroughout, L will denote a solvable Lie algebra over a field F . For a\nsubalgebra U of L we denote by [U : L] the set of all subalgebras S of L\nwith U \u2286 S \u2286 L. We say that [U : L] is complemented if, for any S \u2208 [U : L]\nthere is a T \u2208 [U : L] such that S \u2229T = U and < S, T >= L. Our objective\nis to study the set\n\u2126(U,L) = {S \u2208 [U : L] : [S : L] is complemented};\n1\nin particular, to show that, for a large class of solvable Lie algebras L, the\nminimal elements of this set, \u2126(U,L)min, are conjugate in L. The develop-\nment initially follows closely that of [3].\nWe denote by [U : L]max the set of maximal subalgebras in [U : L]; that\nis, the set of maximal subalgebras of L containing U . If L = A + B where\nA and B are subalgebras of L and A \u2229B = 0 we will write L = A\u2295B.\nLemma 1.1 If S \u2208 \u2126(U,L), S 6= L then S =\n\u22c2\n{M :M \u2208 [S : L]max}.\nProof. Put T =\n\u22c2\n{M : M \u2208 [S : L]max}. Then [S : L] is complemented,\nsince S \u2208 \u2126(U,L), and so T has a complement C in [S : L]. If C 6= L then\nC \u2286 M for some M \u2208 [S : L]max. But then < T,C >= M , contradicting\nthe fact that C is a complement of T in [S : L]. Hence C = L and S =\nT \u2229 C = T \u2229 L = T , as required. \u0003\nThe Frattini subalgebra of L, \u03c6(L), is the intersection of the maximal\nsubalgebras of L. When L is solvable this is always an ideal of L, by [1,\nLemma 3.4]. Extending this notion slightly we put \u03c6(S,L) =\n\u22c2\n{M : M \u2208\n[S : L]max}; clearly, \u03c6(0, L) = \u03c6(L). The above lemma shows that \u03c6(U,L) \u2286\nS for all S \u2208 \u2126(U,L).\nLemma 1.2 If I is an ideal of L and S \u2208 \u2126(U,L), then S + I \u2208 \u2126(U,L).\nProof. Let B \u2208 [S + I : L] \u2286 [S : L]. Since S \u2208 \u2126(U,L), B has a\ncomplement D in [S : L]; that is B \u2229 D = S and < B,D >= L. Put\nC = D+I. Then < B,C >= L and B\u2229C = B\u2229(D+I) = B\u2229D+I = S+I,\nwhence C is a complement for B in [S + I : L] and S + I \u2208 \u2126(U,L). \u0003\nLemma 1.3 Let A be a minimal ideal of L and let M be a complement of A\nin L containing U . Then \u2126(U,M) = {S \u2208 \u2126(U,L) : S \u2286M}. In particular\n\u2126(U,M)min = {S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min : S \u2286M}.\nProof. Note that since L is solvable, M is a maximal subalgebra of L\nand L = A \u2295 M . Suppose first that S \u2208 \u2126(U,L) with S \u2286 M . Then\nS + A \u2208 \u2126(U,L) by Lemma 1.2. The interval [S : M ] is lattice isomorphic\nto [S + I : L] and so is complemented. Hence S \u2208 \u2126(U,M).\nConversely, let S \u2208 \u2126(U,M). Then [S : M ] is complemented. We need\nto show that S \u2208 \u2126(U,L); that is, that [S : L] is complemented. Let\nB \u2208 [S : L]. Then B \u2229M \u2208 [S : M ], so there is a subalgebra D \u2208 [S : M ]\nsuch that < B \u2229M,D >=M and B \u2229D = B \u2229M \u2229D = S.\n2\nIf B 6\u2286 M then M is a proper subalgebra of < B,D >. But M is a\nmaximal subalgebra of L, and so < B,D >= L and D is a complement of\nB in [S : L]. Hence [S : L] is complemented.\nIf B \u2286M , put C = D +A. Then\nL = A\u2295M \u2286 < B,A > + < B,D > \u2286 < B,D +A > = < B,C >,\nso < B,D +A >= L. Also\nB \u2229C = B \u2229 (D+A) = B \u2229M \u2229 (D+A) = B \u2229 (D+M \u2229A) = B \u2229D = S,\nyielding that C is a complement of B in [S : L] and [S : L] is complemented.\n\u0003\nLemma 1.4 Let A be a minimal ideal of L and let S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min with\nA 6\u2286 S. Then there is an M \u2208 [S : L]max such that A 6\u2286M .\nProof. This follows easily from Lemma 1.1. \u0003\nLemma 1.5 Let A be a minimal ideal of L. Then the following are equiv-\nalent:\n(i) A 6\u2286 S for some S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min;\n(ii) A 6\u2286M for some M \u2208 [U : L]max; and\n(iii) for every S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min there is a complement of A in L containing\nS.\nProof. (i)\u21d2 (ii): This follows from Lemma 1.4.\n(ii) \u21d2 (iii): Suppose that A 6\u2286 M for some M \u2208 [U : L]max. Then L =\nA\u2295M . Let S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min.\nSuppose first that A \u2286 S. Then S = A \u2295M \u2229 S and M \u2229 S \u223c= S\/A,\nso the interval [S : L] is lattice isomorphic to [M \u2229 S : M ]. It follows\nthat M \u2229 S \u2208 \u2126(U,M). But Lemma 1.3 now gives that M \u2229 S \u2208 \u2126(U,L),\ncontradicting the minimality of S.\nHence A 6\u2286 S and Lemma 1.4 gives a complement of A containing S.\n(iii)\u21d2 (i): This is trivial. \u0003\nLemma 1.6 If A is an ideal of L and S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min then S +A \u2208 \u2126(U +\nA,L)min.\n3\nProof. It suffices to show that (S +A)\/A \u2208 \u2126((U +A)\/A,L\/A)min and so\nwe may suppose that A is a minimal ideal of L. The result is clear if A \u2286 S,\nsince then U +A \u2286 S. So suppose that A 6\u2286 S.\nThen there is a complement M of A in L containing S, by Lemma 1.5,\nand L = A\u2295M . Moreover, S+A \u2208 \u2126(U+A,L). Choose C \u2208 \u2126(U+A,L)min\nsuch that C \u2286 S + A. Then U \u2286 M \u2229 C \u2286 S \u2286 M and the interval\n[M\u2229C :M ] is lattice isomorphic to [C : L]. It follows thatM\u2229C \u2208 \u2126(U,M)\nand so M \u2229 C \u2208 \u2126(U,L), by Lemma 1.3. But S \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min, which yields\nthat M \u2229 C = S; that is, C = S +A. \u0003\nAt this point the theory starts to diverge from that for groups. We say\nthat L is completely solvable if L2 is nilpotent. For these algebras \u2126(U,L)min\ntakes on a particularly simple form.\nTheorem 1.7 Let L be completely solvable and let U be a subalgebra of L.\nThen \u2126(U,L)min = {\u03c6(U,L)}. In particular, if U = 0 then \u2126(U,L)min =\n{\u03c6(L)}.\nProof. Put B = \u2126(U,L)min, C = \u03c6(U,L). Then \u03c6(U,L) \u2286 B and so\nC \u2286 B, by Lemma 1.1. We now use induction on the dimension of L.\nSuppose first that there is a minimal ideal A of L with A \u2286 C. Then B\/A \u2208\n\u2126((U + A)\/A,L\/A)min, by Lemma 1.6, and so B\/A = \u03c6((U + A)\/A,L\/A),\nby the inductive hypothesis. From this it is clear that B = C.\nSo suppose now that no such minimal ideal exists. Then L is \u03c6-free\nand so L is complemented, by [4, Theorem 1]. Thus there is a subalgebra\nV such that \u3008C, V \u3009 = L and C \u2229 V = 0. It follows that \u3008C,U + V \u3009 = L\nand C \u2229 (U + V ) = U + C \u2229 V = U , whence C \u2208 [U : L] and [C : L]\nis complemented. Thus C \u2208 \u2126(U,L) and the minimality of B yields that\nB = C. \u0003\nIf L is not completely solvable then \u2126(U,L)min can contain more than\none element as we shall see in the next section. However, we do have a con-\njugacy result in some cases. First we need to consider inner automorphisms\nof L. Let x \u2208 L and let adx be the corresponding inner derivation of L.\nIf F has characteristic zero, suppose that (adx)n = 0 for some n; if F has\ncharacteristic p, suppose that x \u2208 I where I is a nilpotent ideal of L of class\nless than p. Put\nexp(adx) =\n\u221e\u2211\nr=0\n1\nr!\n(adx)r.\nThen exp(adx) is an automorphism of L.\n4\nIf B is a subalgebra of L, the centraliser of B in L is CL(B) = {x \u2208 L :\n[x,B] = 0}. We define the nilpotent residual to be L\u221e =\n\u22c2\u221e\ni=1 L\ni, where Li\nare the terms of the lower central series for L. Then we have conjugacy for\nthe following metanilpotent Lie algebras.\nTheorem 1.8 Suppose that L is a solvable Lie algebra over a field F of\ncharacteristic p, and suppose further that L\u221e has nilpotency class less than\np. Let U be a subalgebra of L. Then the elements of \u2126(U,L)min are conjugate\nunder I(L : L\u221e).\nProof. We use induction on the dimension of L. It is clearly true if L has\ndimension one, so suppose it holds for such algebras with dimension smaller\nthan that of L. We can assume that L\u221e 6= 0. Let S1, S2 \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min and\nlet A be a minimal ideal of L with A \u2286 L\u221e. Then (S1+A)\/A, (S2+A)\/A \u2208\n\u2126((U +A)\/A,L\/A)min, by Lemma 1.6, and so (S1 +A)\/A and (S2 +A)\/A\nare conjugate under I(L\/A : L\u221e\/A), by the inductive hypothesis.\nIf A \u2286 S1 then A \u2286 S2, by Lemma 1.5, and there is an x \u2208 L\n\u221e such\nthat S1 exp(adx) = S2; that is, S1 and S2 are conjugate under I(L : L\n\u221e).\nSo suppose that A 6\u2286 S1. Then there are complements M1 and M2 of\nA in L with S1 \u2286 M1 and S2 \u2286 M2, by Lemma 1.5. Put C = CM1(A),\nwhich is an ideal of L. If C = 0 then CL(A) = A and there is a \u2208 A such\nthat M2 exp(ad a) = M1, by [2, Theorem 1.1], whence S2 exp(ad a) \u2286 M2\nexp(ad a) =M1.\nIf C 6= 0, then (S1+C)\/C and (S2+C)\/C are conjugate under I(L\/C :\n(L\u221e + C)\/C), by the inductive hypothesis. It follows that there is an x \u2208\nL\u221e such that S2 exp(adx + C) \u2286 S1 + C exp(ad a) \u2286 M1, which gives\nS2 exp(adx) \u2286 M1. Now L = A \u2295 M1, so L\n\u221e \u2286 A \u2295 M\u221e1 . Moreover,\n[A,L\u221e] = 0 since L\u221e is nilpotent, so M\u221e1 is an ideal of L. Put x = a + b,\nwhere a \u2208 A, b \u2208M\u221e1 . Then, for each s2 \u2208 S2, we have s2+s2 adx+ . . .+s2\n(adx)n \u2208 M1, which gives s2 + s2 ad a \u2208 M1. Thus, again we have that S2\nexp(ad a) \u2286M1 for some a \u2208 A.\nSo S1, S2 exp(ad a) \u2286 M1 for some a \u2208 A. Now U \u2286 S1 \u2286 M1 and U\nexp(ad a) \u2286 S2 exp(ad a) \u2286 M1, so, for each u \u2208 U , u + [a, u] \u2208 M1 which\ngives [a, u] \u2208 A\u2229M1 = 0; that is, a \u2208 CL(U) and U exp(ad a) = U . Thus S2\nexp(ad a) \u2208 \u2126(U exp(ad a), L)min = \u2126(U,L)min. But now Lemma 1.3 yields\nthat S1, S2 exp(ad a) \u2208 \u2126(U,M1)min and the required conjugacy of S1 and\nS2 follows from the inductive hypothesis. \u0003\n5\n2 U-prefrattini subalgebras\nLet\n0 = A0 \u2282 A1 \u2282 . . . \u2282 An = L (1)\nbe a fixed chief series for L. We say that Ai\/Ai\u22121 is a Frattini chief factor if\nAi\/Ai\u22121 \u2286 \u03c6(L\/Ai\u22121); it is complemented if there is a maximal subalgebra\nM of L such that L = Ai +M and Ai \u2229M = Ai\u22121. When L is solvable it is\neasy to see that a chief factor is Frattini if and only if it is not complemented.\nThis can be generalised as follows.\nThe factor algebra Ai\/Ai\u22121 is called a U -Frattini chief factor if\nAi \u2286 \u03c6(U +Ai\u22121, L) or if U +Ai\u22121 = L.\nIf Ai\/Ai\u22121 is not a U -Frattini chief factor there is an M \u2208 [U + Ai\u22121 :\nL]max for which Ai 6\u2286 M ; that is, M is a complement of the chief factor\nAi\/Ai\u22121. We have a sharpened form of the Jordan-Ho\u00a8lder Theorem in which\nU -Frattini chief factors correspond. First we need a lemma.\nLemma 2.1 Let A1, A2 be distinct minimal ideals of the solvable Lie algebra\nL. Then there is a bijection\n\u03b8 : {A1, (A1 +A2)\/A1} \u2192 {A2, (A1 +A2)\/A2}\nsuch that corresponding chief factors have the same dimension and U -Frattini\nchief factors correspond to one another.\nProof. Clearly we can assume that U 6= L. Put A = A1 \u2295 A2. Suppose\nfirst that A1 is a U -Frattini chief factor. Then A1 \u2286 \u03c6(U,L). Thus A \u2286\n\u03c6(U + A2, L) and A\/A2 is a U -Frattini chief factor. If A\/A1 is also a U -\nFrattini chief factor, then A \u2286 \u03c6(U +A1, L), which yields that A \u2286 \u03c6(U,L),\nand all four factors are U -Frattini. In this case we can choose \u03b8 so that\n\u03b8(A1) = A\/A2 and \u03b8(A\/A1) = A2. If A\/A1 is not a U -Frattini chief factor,\nthen nor is A2, by the same argument as above, and so the same choice of\n\u03b8 suffices; likewise if none of the factors are U -Frattini chief factors.\nThe remaining case is where A1 and A2 are not U -Frattini chief factors\nbut A\/A2 is. Then A1 6\u2286 \u03c6(U,L), A2 6\u2286 \u03c6(U,L) and either A \u2286 \u03c6(U+A2, L)\nor U + A2 = L. Thus there exists M \u2208 [U,L]max such that A1 6\u2286 M ,\ngiving L = A1 \u2295M . Put A3 = M \u2229 A. Then A3 \u2295 A1 = M \u2229 A \u2295 A1 =\n(M +A1) \u2229A = A, and so A3 \u223c= A\/A1 \u223c= A2. If A3 = A2 then U +A2 \u2286M\nwhich gives A \u2286 M : a contradiction. Hence A3 6= A2, A = A3 \u2295 A2 and\n6\nA3 \u223c= A\/A2 \u223c= A1. It follows that all of the chief factors have the same\ndimension.\nIf U +A1 = L, then A\/A1 is a U -Frattini chief factor, so we can choose\n\u03b8 so that \u03b8(A1) = A2 and \u03b8(A\/A1) = A\/A2. If U + A1 6= L, let N \u2208\n[U + A1, L]max. If A2 6\u2286 N then L = A2 \u2295 N and N \u2229 A = A1. But\nA \u2286 \u03c6(U+A2, L) implies that A \u2286 \u03c6(U,L)+A2, whence A+A2+\u03c6(U,L)\u2229A.\nIt follows that \u03c6(U,L)\u2229A \u2286 N \u2229A = A1, giving \u03c6(U,L)\u2229A = A1. But now\nA1 \u2286 \u03c6(U,L): a contradiction. We must, therefore, have A2 \u2286 N and so\nA \u2286 N . Thus A \u2286 \u03c6(U + A1, L); that is, A\/A1 is a U -Frattini chief factor.\nIn this case we can again choose \u03b8 so that \u03b8(A1) = A2 and \u03b8(A\/A1) = A\/A2.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.2 Let\n0 < A1 < . . . < An = L (1)\n0 < B1 < . . . < Bn = L (2)\nbe chief series for the solvable Lie algebra L. Then there is a bijection\nbetween the chief factors of these two series such that corresponding factors\nhave the same dimension and such that the U -Frattini chief factors in the\ntwo series correspond.\nProof. These two series have the same length by a version of the Jordan\nHo\u00a8lder Theorem. We induction on n. The result is clearly true if n = 1.\nSo let n > 1 and suppose that the result holds for all solvable Lie algebras\nwith chief series of length \u2264 n\u2212 1. If A1 = B1, then applying the inductive\nhypothesis to L\/A1 gives a suitable bijection between the factors above A1,\nand then we can map A1 to B1 and we have the result.\nSo suppose that A1 and B1 are distinct and put A = A1 \u2295 B1. Then\nA\/A1 and A\/B1 are chief factors of L and there are chief series of the form\n0 < A1 < A < C3 < . . . < Cn = L (3)\n0 < B1 < A < C3 < . . . < Cn = L (4)\nDefine an equivalence relation on the chief series of L by saying that two\nsuch series are equivalent if there is a bijection between their chief factors\nsatisfying the requirements of the theorem. Since series (1) and (3) have a\nminimal ideal in common, they are equivalent. Similarly, sereis (2) and (4)\nare equivalent. Moreover, since series (3) and (4) coincide above A they are\nalso equivalent, by Lemma 2.1. Hence the series (1) and (2) are equivalent,\nas required. \u0003\n7\nWe define the set I by i \u2208 I if and only if Ai\/Ai\u22121 is not a U -Frattini\nchief factor of L. For each i \u2208 I put\nMi = {M \u2208 [U +Ai\u22121, L]max : Ai 6\u2286M}.\nThen B is a U -prefrattini subalgebra of L if\nB =\n\u22c2\ni\u2208I\nMi for some Mi \u2208Mi.\nIf U = 0 we will refer to B simply as a prefrattini subalgebra of L.\nThe subalgebra B avoids Ai\/Ai\u22121 if B \u2229 Ai = B \u2229 Ai\u22121; likewise, B\ncovers Ai\/Ai\u22121 if B+Ai = B+Ai\u22121. Then we have the following important\nproperty of U -prefrattini subalgebras of L.\nLemma 2.3 If B is a U -prefrattini subalgebra of L then it covers all U -\nFrattini chief factors of L in (1) and avoids the rest.\nProof. Let B be a U -prefrattini subalgebra of L and let Ai\/Ai\u22121 be a chief\nfactor of L. If it is a U -Frattini chief factor then either Ai \u2286 \u03c6(U +Ai\u22121, L)\nor else U+Ai\u22121 = L. In the former case, every maximal subalgebra of L that\ncontains U+Ai\u22121 also contains Ai, and so Ai \u2286 B. In either case, therefore,\nB covers Ai\/Ai\u22121. If it is not a U -Frattini chief factor we have B \u2286 Mi\nwhere L = Ai +Mi and Ai \u2229Mi = Ai\u22121. Hence B \u2229 Ai = B \u2229Mi \u2229 Ai =\nB \u2229Ai \u2212 1 \u2286 B \u2229Ai, and so B avoids Ai\/Ai\u22121. \u0003\nThe next four results are dedicated to showing how the U -prefrattini\nsubalgebras relate to the material in the previous section. The first lemma\nis helpful when trying to calculate U -prefrattini subalgebras.\nLemma 2.4 Let B be a U -prefrattini subalgebra of L. Then\ndimB =\n\u2211\ni\/\u2208I\n(dimAi \u2212 dimAi\u22121);\nin particular, all U -prefrattini subalgebras of L have the same dimension.\nProof. We use induction on dimL. The result is clear if L is abelian, so\nsuppose it holds for Lie algebras of smaller dimension than L. It is easy to\ncheck that (B + A1)\/A1 is a ((U + A1)\/A1)-prefrattini subalgebra of L\/A1\nand so\ndim\n(\nB +A1\nA1\n)\n=\n\u2211\ni\u2208I,i6=1\n(dimAi \u2212 dimAi\u22121),\n8\nby the inductive hypothesis. If A1\/A0 is a U -Frattini chief factor of L, then\nB covers A1\/A0, whence B = B +A1 and\ndimB = dimA1 + dim\n(\nB +A1\nA1\n)\n=\n\u2211\ni\u2208I\n(dimAi \u2212 dimAi\u22121).\nIf A1\/A0 is not a U -Frattini chief factor of L, then B avoids A1\/A0, whence\nB \u2229A1 = 0 and\ndimB = dim\n(\nB +A1\nA1\n)\n=\n\u2211\ni\u2208I\n(dimAi \u2212 dimAi\u22121).\n\u0003\nLet \u03a0(U,L) be the set of U -prefrattini subalgebras of L.\nLemma 2.5 \u03a0(U,L) \u2286 \u2126(U,L).\nProof. (i) We use induction on dimL. The result is clear if L is abelian,\nso suppose it holds for Lie algebras of dimension less than that of L. Let\nB \u2208 \u03a0(U,L). Then\nB +A1\nA1\n\u2208 \u03a0\n(\nU +A1\nA1\n,\nL\nA1\n)\n\u2286 \u2126\n(\nU +A1\nA1\n,\nL\nA1\n)\n,\nwhence B+A1 \u2208 \u2126(U,L). If A1 \u2286 B we have B \u2208 \u2126(U,L). So suppose that\nA1 6\u2286 B. Then B does not cover A1\/A0, so A1\/A0 is not a U -Frattini chief\nfactor of L. It follows that 1 \u2208 I, and so there is a maximal subalgebra M\nof L with B \u2286 M and A1 6\u2286 M . But now L = A1 \u2295M and the intervals\n[B + A1 : L] and [B : M ] are lattice isomorphic, which yields that [B : M ]\nis complemented. It follows from Lemma 1.3 that B \u2208 \u2126(U,L) again. \u0003\nLemma 2.6 \u2126(U,L)min \u2286 \u03a0(U,L).\nProof. Let B \u2208 \u2126(U,L)min and let Ai\/Ai\u22121 be a chief factor of L. By\nLemma 1.6, (\nB +Ai\u22121\nAi\u22121\n)\n\u2208 \u2126\n(\nU +Ai\u22121\nAi\u22121\n,\nL\nAi\u22121\n)\nmin\n.\nWe now apply Lemma 1.5 to the minimal ideal Ai\/Ai\u22121 of L\/Ai\u22121. If\nAi\/Ai\u22121 is a U -Frattini chief factor then it doesn\u2019t have a complement in\nL\/Ai\u22121 and Lemma 1.5 gives that Ai \u2286 B+Ai\u22121, whence Ai+B = Ai\u22121+B\nand B covers Ai\/Ai\u22121.\n9\nIf Ai\/Ai\u22121 is not a U -Frattini chief factor then it has a complement\nMi\/Ai\u22121 in L\/Ai\u22121 and Lemma 1.5 gives that it has such a complement\ncontaining (B + Ai\u22121)\/Ai\u22121; that is L = Mi + Ai, Mi \u2229 Ai = Ai\u22121 and\nB + Ai\u22121 \u2286 Mi. But now B \u2229 Ai \u2286 B \u2229 Ai + Ai\u22121 = (B + Ai\u22121) \u2229 Ai \u2286\nMi \u2229 Ai = Ai\u22121. It follows that B \u2229 Ai = B \u2229 Ai\u22121 and B avoids Ai\/Ai\u22121.\nClearly Mi \u2208Mi and B \u2286 C =\n\u22c2\ni\u2208IMi \u2208 \u03a0(U,L). But B covers or avoids\nthe same chief factors of (1) as C, so the proof of Lemma 2.4 shows that\ndimB = dimC. It follows that B = C \u2208 \u03a0(U,L). \u0003\nPutting the previous three Lemmas together yields the following result.\nTheorem 2.7 \u2126(U,L)min = \u03a0(U,L).\nNotice that, in particular, the above result shows that the definition of\nU -prefrattini subalgebras does not depend on the choice of chief series.\nCorollary 2.8 If A is an ideal of L and S \u2208 \u03a0(U,L) then (S + A)\/A \u2208\n\u03a0((U +A)\/A,L\/A).\nProof. This follows from Theorem 2.7 and Lemma 1.6. \u0003\nCorollary 2.9 For every solvable Lie algebra L,\n\u03c6(U,L) =\n\u22c2\nB\u2208\u03a0(U,L)\nB.\nProof. Put P =\n\u22c2\nB\u2208\u03a0(U,L)B. Then \u03c6(U,L) \u2286 P , by Theorem 2.7 and\nLemma 1.1. Let M \u2208 [U,L]max. There is an i such that Ai\u22121 \u2286 M but\nAi 6\u2286M (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Then Ai\/Ai\u22121 is not a U -Frattini chief factor of L, so\ni \u2208 I and M \u2208 Mi. Thus there is B \u2208 \u03a0(U,L) such that B \u2286 M , whence\nP \u2286M . Hence P \u2286 \u03c6(U,L). \u0003\nCorollary 2.10 Let L be completely solvable and let U be a subalgebra of\nL. Then \u03a0(U,L) = {\u03c6(U,L)}. In particular, \u03a0(0, L) = {\u03c6(L)}.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 1.7. \u0003\nCorollary 2.11 Suppose that L is a solvable Lie algebra over a field F of\ncharacteristic p, and suppose further that L\u221e has nilpotency class less than\np. Let U be a subalgebra of L. Then the elements of \u03a0(U,L) are conjugate\nunder I(L : L\u221e).\n10\nProof. This follows from Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 1.8. \u0003\nIf L2 is not nilpotent then \u03a0(U,L) can contain more than one element,\nas the following example shows.\nExample 2.1 Let F be a field of characteristic p (perfect if p = 2), and L =\n(\u2295p\u22121i=0Fei)\u2295Fc\u2295Fs\u2295Fx with [ei, c] = ei, [ei, s] = ei+1 for i = 0, . . . , p\u22122,\n[ep\u22121, s] = 0, [ei, x] = iei\u22121 for i = 0, . . . , p\u2212 1 and e\u22121 = 0, [s, x] = c, and\nall other products zero.\nPut A0 = 0, A1 = \u2295\np\u22121\ni=0Fei, A2 = A1 \u2295 Fc, A3 = A2 \u2295 Fs, A4 = L.\nThen\n0 = A0 \u2282 A1 \u2282 A2 \u2282 A3 \u2282 A4 = L\nis a chief series for L in which A2\/A1 is the only Frattini chief factor. It\nis, therefore, straightforward to see that the prefrattini subalgebras of L are\nthe one-dimensional subalgebras F (\u03b1c+ a) where a \u2208 A1 = L\n\u221e, \u03b1 \u2208 F .\nNote that these are all conjugate under inner automorphisms of the\nform 1+ ad a. This is not always the case, however. For, if B is a faithful\ncompletely reducible L-module and we formX = B\u2295L, where B2 = 0 and L\nacts on B under the given L-module action, then the prefrattini subalgebras\nare still of the form F (\u03b1c + a) where a \u2208 A1. However, B is the unique\nminimal ideal of L and these subalgebras are not conjugate under inner\nautomorphisms of the form 1+ ad b, b \u2208 B. Since B is the nilradical of X,\ndefining other inner automorphisms is problematic. Note that X\u221e = B+A1\nwhich is not nilpotent.\nReferences\n[1] D.W. Barnes and H.M.
