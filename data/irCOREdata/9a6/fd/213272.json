In the introduction to the forum, we outline the ways in \nwhich scholars have contested the emergence of the sovereign state and examine the ethical \nissues surrounding the normative value of this form of rule.

For the \nformer, sovereignty is the archetypal IR101 topic. Students entering the subject are informed that \nsovereignty emerged in Europe sometime around the mid seventeenth century before being \nexported to the rest of the world, often by force of arms, over the next few centuries. There may \nbe disagreement over sovereignty\u2019s precise point of origin (cf. Ruggie, 1983; Rosenberg, 1994; \nSpruyt, 1994; Krasner, 1999; Reus-Smit, 1999; Philpott, 2001; Osiander, 2001; Teschke, 2003), \nbut the basic narrative remains intact: for IR \u2013 sovereignty is synonymous with the emergence of \nthe modern state system and, as such, forms the generative grammar of IR as a distinct subject \nmatter. For the latter, sovereignty is equally important. Only rarely do policy makers make a \nspeech about international affairs without reference to sovereignty: it is at the heart of debates \nabout intervention \u2013 potential or actual \u2013 in Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur and Zimbabwe; it speaks to \nthe capacity of the European Union (EU), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), NATO and \nother international organisations to exert control over significant spheres of international politics; \nand it undergirds discussions about the legitimacy of bodies such as the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC), the status of \u201cprisoners of war\u201d in the \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d and the juridical space \noccupied by US military tribunals or practices of \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d. Even when states \nexplicitly intervene in other territories \u2013 whether through the brute fact of invasion or by subtler \nmeans of diplomacy and trade \u2013 they often do so by reference to why sovereignty can be \nsuspended in special cases. As such, even when the norm of sovereignty is broken, it still appears \nas the central referent point of international politics. In short, sovereignty is a conceptual marker, \nnormative frame and political tool without rival. It is IR\u2019s font and altar.  \n \nGiven the centrality of sovereignty to IR, it is no surprise to find numerous debates circulating \naround it: its place as ground-rule (Bull, 1984) or gibberish (James, 1984); its spread as a \nfundamental institution of international society (Watson, 1992; Buzan, 2004; Buzan and Little, \n2010) or as a coercive standard of civilisation (Gong, 1984; Keene, 2002; Suzuki, 2009); and its \nemergence (Ruggie, 1983) and possible supersession in the contemporary world (Linklater, \n1998; Habermas, 2001; Held, 2004). Over recent years, sovereignty has, once more, been at the \ncentre of disciplinary debates. The emergence of practices like humanitarian intervention, the \n \n3 \nextension of a human rights regime around the world, the growing voices of transnational \nindigenous movements in international organisations, the increasing interdependence of \neconomies, and the rise of US hyperpower speak to a complex topography which has outgrown \nshorthands of formal equality and non-intervention. But even as sovereignty is seen to be on the \nretreat, there are pertinent reminders \u2013 not least amongst them the war in Iraq and the economic \ncrisis instituted by the 2007 credit crunch \u2013 which speak to the continuing hold of sovereignty on \ninternational affairs. At the very least, sovereignty appears as a defensive wall against externally \ngenerated instabilities. And even as migration, travel, economic interdependence and \ntechnological exchanges serve to weaken national borders, so virulent strains of nationalism, \nlocally rooted identities, and the renationalisation of state security and economic powers act to \nharden them.  \n \nAlongside contestation over the substantive content of sovereignty can be found corresponding \nquestions regarding the continuing hold of sovereignty as a normative frame. Frequently, \ncosmopolitan theorists see sovereignty as a barrier to the emergence of a progressive form of \npolitics in which national boundaries place no (or at least relatively few) restrictions on notions \nof political community (Held, 1995; Habermas, 2001; Fraser and Honneth, 2003; Fraser, 2008). \nNor, these scholars argue, should national borders \u2013 whether real or imagined \u2013 act as barriers to \npolicies geared at reducing poverty (Pogge, 2008), raising levels of development (Collier, 2007) \nor generating co-operative security communities (Beck, 2006). In this way, the increasing \n\u201cthickness\u201d of the international sphere as witnessed by the burgeoning remit of units of global \ngovernance, the extension of international law and the emergence of apparently robust \ninternational regimes stand as hallmarks of a cosmopolitan era which can eliminate \u201cbackward\u201d \nideas like sovereignty. However, just as there is fundamental disagreement over the substantive \ncontent of sovereignty in the contemporary world, so too are there sharp disagreements over the \nnormative implications of a decline in sovereignty. Indeed, critics argue that imagining a world \nwithout borders may induce a concomitant decline in notions of solidarity and community, \nengendering a hollowing out of politics which is as counterproductive as it is na\u00efve (Chandler, \n2009). Equally importantly, claims about the need for emancipatory politics to bury ideas of \nsovereignty sit uneasily with those states, many of whom have experienced centuries of \n \n4 \nimperialism, colonisation and other forms of exploitation, which see claims of national \nsovereignty as powerful bulwarks against foreign aggression (Lawson, 2008).  \n \nThe place of sovereignty in contemporary world politics, therefore, can be seen as doubly \ncontested: first, in terms of its salience as a substantive area of international politics; and second, \nin terms of its role as a normative frame of reference. Indeed, some of the core debates in the \ndiscipline concern critiques over how sovereignty has been understood theoretically and \nhistorically on the one hand, and over the ethical promise of the good life provided by \u2013 or \nsubverted by \u2013 sovereign forms of rule on the other. Needless to say, few classical texts on \nsovereignty divorced the moral significance of the condition from its theorization. This forum \nengages formatively with these debates \u2013 ten years after Stephen Krasner\u2019s (1999) landmark \ninvestigation of sovereignty as \u201corganised hypocrisy\u201d, it is time to revisit the hold of sovereignty \non the international imagination. In order to situate the contributions within the vast literature on \nthe subject, we first sketch the ways in which scholars have contested the emergence and \nfacticity of the sovereign state, before moving on to examine the ethical issues surrounding the \nnormative value of this form of statehood. The final section illustrates the specific ways in which \nthe other articles in the forum contribute to our understanding of the \u201cfact\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d \u2013 or \u201cis\u201d \nand \u201cought\u201d \u2013 of sovereignty.  \n \nThe fact of sovereignty? \nIf students of International Relations question the hold of sovereignty over the subject, they \nusually do so by reference to when sovereignty appeared: in the cuius region, eius religio (whose \nthe region, his the religion) clauses instituted at the Treaties of Augsburg (1555) and Westphalia \n(1648) (Wight, 1992); in the inter-state wars and geopolitical struggles ushered in by the \nEuropean military revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Gilpin, 1981; Mann, \n1988; Tilly, 1992); in normative shifts associated with shifting understandings of territoriality \n(Ruggie, 1983), religious belief (Philpott, 2001; Nexon, 2009) and statehood (Reus-Smit, 1999); \nvia fundamental shake-ups to the constitution of modern subjectivity (Walker, 1993; Weber, \n1995; Bartelson, 1995); or in the development of private property rights and other processes \nassociated with the emergence of industrial capitalism (Rosenberg, 1994; Teschke, 2003). When \nconducting these debates, IR scholars are effectively carbon-dating the discipline\u2019s \u201cbig bang\u201d. \n \n5 \nFor sovereignty is considered to be IR\u2019s moment of intellectual conception, marking the advent \nof an order which, it is argued, first placed meaningful constraints on interference in the \n\u201cinternal\u201d affairs of states. As such, sovereignty is to IR what modernity is to other social \nsciences \u2013 its leitmotif. \n \nThe attempt to date sovereignty is, therefore, an important one. Indeed, the shorthand of \n\u201cWestphalia\u201d to describe both modern and \u201cnormal\u201d inter-state relations is one employed by \nboth academics and policy makers alike. Likewise, the degree to which we understand the \ncurrent political order as post-Westphalian relies on a prior assumption about how Westphalian \nthe order was in the first place. And Westphalia is certainly important in as much as it is a \nrepresentation of a political imaginary which posits the formal, reciprocal recognition by nation-\nstates of the political sovereignty of other like-units, in other words the process by which \ncomposite polities became caged within a territorially limited, relatively autonomous, centrally \ndemarcated political unit \u2013 the nation-state. At the very least, so the argument goes, Westphalia \nprovides a hegemonic story for how political imaginaries have developed over the last few \ncenturies, with \u201cpost-Westphalia\u201d acting as the leading edge of emancipatory possibilities within \nthe contemporary era.  \n \nHowever, there are a number of problems with this standard script, not least the consideration \nthat formal sovereignty \u2013 the generative grammar of the Westphalian states-system \u2013 has been \nconsistently subject to convention, contract, coercion and imposition (Krasner, 1999). It is clear \nfrom the historical record that Westphalia has usually been a luxury restricted to the great powers \n\u2013 certainly those in the colonies who appealed for the right to national self-determination based \non the recognition of formal sovereignty tended to find their petitions falling on deaf ears. It was \nonly after the Hague Conference of 1899 that attendance at international conferences included \nnon-Europeans, and it was only at the second Hague Conference of 1907 that Europeans were \noutnumbered by non-Europeans. At the Paris Peace talks of 1919, Robert Lansing (in Chandler, \n2003: 29), the US Secretary of State, commented critically on President Wilson\u2019s avocation of \nthe principle of self-determination, \n \nThe more I think about the President\u2019s declaration of the right of self-determination, the \nmore convinced I am of the danger of putting such ideas into the minds of certain races. It \n \n6 \nis bound to be the basis of impossible demands and to create trouble in many lands. What \neffect will it have on the Irish, the Indians, the Egyptians, and the nationalists among the \nBoers? Will not the Mohammedans of Syria and Palestine and possibly Morocco and \nTripoli rely on it? \n \nWilson himself saw self-determination as extendable only to Central Europe and pressured \ndelegates in the League of Nations to reject Japan\u2019s request to include a clause on racial equality \nin its charter (Lauren, 1996; Ambrosius, 2007). The Bolshevik Declaration of the Rights of the \nToiling and Exploited People, published in January 1918, may have extended principles of rights \nto the non-West but it was only after the birth of the United Nations that the principle of \nsovereign equality became more widely recognised. In this sense, sovereignty \u2013 both in terms of \nlegitimate authority and in terms of power capabilities \u2013 was a partial game during the modern \nperiod, a principle which has been recognised, both in de jure and de facto terms, only relatively \nrecently (Chandler, 2003). \n \nOne might even say that until relatively recently, the broader dynamic instituted by the formation \nand break-up of empires was much more important to the development of the modern world than \nthe integrity of Westphalian sovereignty. Indeed, world politics in the modern era has largely \nbeen oriented around a complex system of hierarchy \u2013 differentiated by time and place \u2013 in \nwhich various metropoles have subordinated their congeries (Hobson and Sharman, 2005). \nWithin this system, authority has been parcelled out in a procession of authority relations, or as \nJack Donnelly (2006) prefers, as variations of \u201chierarchy in anarchy\u201d. Throughout the early \nmodern period, various \u201cconfetti empires\u201d (Teschke, 2006), curious public-private hybrids, \ncompeted in the formation of hierarchical multi-states systems around the world, practising \ndiverse strategies of spatialisastion and territorialisation which brought much of the world within \ntheir compass. The subsequent formalisation of land and sea empires, and their break-up during \nthe twentieth century produced post-imperial orders, at least in some parts of the world, which \nironically enough, required the sanctioning authority of imperial powers \u2013 what Niall Ferguson \n(2005) calls the \u201cimperialism of anti-imperialism\u201d. In this way, Britain repackaged its former \ncolonies as \u201coverseas territories\u201d, granted citizenship rights to its residents, acknowledged the \nright to self-determination, and supported programmes of modernisation, both political and \neconomic, as long as the overarching relationship between the former colonial master and newly \n \n7 \n\u201cindependent\u201d states remained one of dependence. It was only after the end of the Second World \nWar that empires became widely delegitimised as a form of political authority and imagination, \nand even then, the post-colonial breaking of European empires required sponsorship by a \nsuperpower. The Soviet Union ran an informal empire throughout the Cold War in which claims \nfor national sovereignty were regularly engulfed within broader claims of political authority, by \nforce if necessary (Wendt and Friedheim, 1995). France, Portugal and other European states \nmaintained formal empires until the 1970s, and continue to retain dependencies today.  \n \nEven during the post-Cold War era can be found debates over the continuing hold of empire as a \nform of rule, both as regards the scale and scope of US power (Ikenberry, 2002; Mann, 2003; \nIgnatieff, 2003; Cox, 2004), and the extent to which polities such as China, India and Russia \nshould be understood as nation-states or as (post) imperial spaces. Moreover, the rise of \n\u201cinternational administrations\u201d that govern post-conflict zones, such as in the former Yugoslavia \nand East Timor, can best be seen as a redux version of the mandate system of the League of \nNations (Bain, 2003). The mandate system was perhaps the first occasion where international \ninstitutions had full access to the interior of societies (Anghie, 2002). Under this system, the \npopulations in the remnants of the German and Ottoman empires were governed according to \nwhere they fell on a racialized line of progress from savagery to civilization. And although the \ncurrent version of mandate-rule does not directly justify administration according to racialized \ntypographies, nevertheless the new articulation holds assumptions that echo John Stuart Mill\u2019s \narguments over intervention and colonization (Jahn, 2006), not least that the \u201cgood\u201d life cannot \nbe cultivated amongst those who do not display the laws and mores adequate for the task. In \nthese cases, so the argument goes, the \u201ccorrect\u201d form of order and rule must be delivered by \nexternal agents. And such considerations can also be said to apply to the field of peacekeeping \n(Paris, 2002), where actions have sometimes been justified, at least by European voices, as \npositively imperialist in character (e.g. Cooper, 2002; see also Biccum, 2005).  \n \nIn sum, therefore, the modern era has seen the development of multiple states-systems which live \noff the presence of imperial guarantors. As such, the international realm, both during the modern \nera and further back in history (Kaufman et al eds., 2007), can better be characterised in terms of \nimperial or hegemonic hierarchy rather than by sovereign equality (Watson, 1992; Cooley, \n \n8 \n2005). Indeed, the principal question in IR now appears to be less geared at establishing the \nimportance of hierarchy to world historical development than in exploring the various logics \nunder which different forms of hierarchy operate (Nexon and Wright, 2007). The key point is \nthat the broader age of hierarchy\/empire subsumes the Westphalian moment within its canvass, \nleading us to see the logic of reciprocal sovereignty bounded or caged within the nation state as \nboth recent and limited. As such, if we are to speak of a Westphalian political imaginary, we \nshould recognise that it has reached its zenith rather than its nadir in the post-Cold War world, a \nperiod in which state sovereignty \u2013 both as aspiration and practice \u2013 has become much more \nextensively available than in previous epochs. For those who fought so long for freedom from \nthe yoke of European empire, particularly in the Third World, Westphalian state sovereignty has \noften served as both a source of emancipation and as a first line of defence against fundamental \nsources of inequality, whether these are historical, economic or geopolitical in origin. As a result, \nattempts at building broader dialogic and institutional forums beyond the nation-state will \ncontinue to run up against some all-too-real obstacles. Witness, for example, the centrality of \nnotions of sovereign authority to the debates about trade, development, aid and security that \nconstitute the quotidian stuff of politics within the UN system, or somewhat more gruesomely, to \nthe ongoing conflict in Iraq. \n \nThe value of sovereignty? \nRunning simultaneously to these debates over the substantive content of sovereignty can be \nfound contestation over the very desirability of modern sovereignty as the telos of human \ndevelopment. In fact, in modern history, issues of political representation, economic \nredistribution and cultural recognition were not always delineated cleanly within bounded \nsovereign states, but often went across and between them via processes of revolution and \ncounter-revolution (Halliday, 1999; Lawson, 2005). Broader notions of political community \nflourished and multiplied, such as the Islamic umma (Roy, 2006), pan-racial movements \n(Shilliam, 2006), various regional and pan-regional formations (such as the Bandung \u201cmoment\u201d) \n(Berger, 2004), anti-colonial internationalism including the Tricontinental movement (Young, \n2001), transnational diasporic communities (Clifford, 1994), international women\u2019s movements \n(Rupp, 1997), indigenous groupings (Morgan, 2007), and, of course, liberal cosmopolitanism \nitself (Held, 2004). In this sense, even if we do accept the Westphalian order as predominant \n \n9 \nafter 1945, we must also accept that there were rival forms of political legitimacy and justice \nduring this period, for example the emergence of global civil society as invested in the human \nrights regime (Nash, 2009). It is illustrative to note that the formation of the UN institutionalises \nthese contradictions, recognising as it does both formal Westphalian sovereignty as vested in \nmember states, and the universal sanctity of human rights (Brown, 2006).   \n \nDespite the historical existence of this plethora of projects, many believe that with the \ndevelopment of the European Union we stand at the threshold of an extra-territorial and multi-\nlevel universe of political communities, in which nation-states, regional organisations and \ninternational organisations overlap (Held, 2002). This debate has prompted extended exchanges \nabout the nature of the supposed transformation in European sovereignty, in particular over \nwhether this new era holds the potential for an emancipatory transformation in the rights and \nduties of the political subject away from the strictures of territorial exclusivity. For many \nresearchers, the European Union stands as an exemplar of the politics of the possible (e.g. \nArchibugi, 2008) with subsequent debate focusing on the broader salience of J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 \nthesis of a \u201cpostnational constellation\u201d (Habermas, 2001; Borowiak, 2008; Kumar, 2008; Wilde, \n2007). Indeed, critical theorists rooted in the Frankfurt tradition, if often unsympathetic to the \ncurrent shape of the EU, tend to see it as containing the potential for dismantling the political \nstraightjacket that fractures the global dialogic community (Beck, 2006; Honneth, 2009). \n \nThe Global War on Terror has further raised the stakes of this debate. Since 9\/11, talk has been \nrife of the decline of the West (Anderson et al, 2008) and the break up of the Transatlantic \nCommunity itself (Cox, 2005). The Transatlantic Community \u2013 as the quintessential example of \na robust \u201csecurity community\u201d \u2013 is often considered to be the protector and cultivator of Western \ncivilization. Indeed, NATO has long held the promise, at least for some, of reaping the dividends \nof a \u201cdemocratic peace\u201d in international affairs (Deutsch et al, 1957). In turn, the nerve centre of \nthe community has often been understood to reside in the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between Britain \nand the US (Danchev, 1996), with NATO and the OEEC (now OECD) constituting its military \nand economic sinews. However, the bridge between the United States and Europe seems to have \nweakened (perhaps to the point of collapse) because it cannot bear the weight of two (apparently) \ndifferent forms of foreign policy \u2013 the Hobbesian and the Kantian (Kagan, 2002) \u2013 which are \n \n10 \nrooted in divergent power capabilities and, increasingly, distinct world views. For some \nluminaries (e.g. Habermas and Derrida, 2006), the distinctiveness of a European public sphere \noffers hope for a form of world citizenship that can be extended outwards to subsume within it \nthe unilateralism and belligerency of the United States (see also Fraser, 2005). Indeed, the \nprogressive, cosmopolitan values of the European public sphere could inform the composition of \nan EU foreign policy that exercises a transformative \u201cnormative power\u201d eschewing the poles of a \nrealist proto-superpower and an idealist \u201cEUtopia\u201d in order to promote the conditions necessary \nfor the emergence of world citizenship (Rosecrance, 1998; Manners, 2008; Dunne, 2008). And \nsuch views are not merely academic, but evident amongst the wider European foreign policy \nintelligentsia (e.g. Solana, 2005; Leonard, 2005). On the other hand, a sense of a \u201cdemocratic \ndeficit\u201d has developed over the organisation and functioning of the EU, in particular its elitism, \none manifested in recent votes against a European Constitution combined with a general lethargy \ntowards the institutions of the EU themselves (Follesdal and Hix, 2005). There are also \nincreasing concerns over the EU\u2019s own flirtations with hyper-power and, indeed, with the notion \nof empire (M\u00fcnkler, 2007), albeit only in the sense of what the President of the Commission, \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, calls a specifically \u201cnon-imperial\u201d empire (Waterfield, 2007).  \n \nThese trends should be seen within a broader sense of disillusionment with \u2013 and detachment \nfrom \u2013 the international institutions of global governance (Held and Koenig-Archibugi, 2003). \nIndeed, these trends are only intelligible if one remembers that the abiding normative meaning of \nmodern sovereignty was popular in intent, centring upon the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination. Taking this line of reasoning to its logical conclusion, one might say that the \nrising tide of antipathy in much commentary \u2013 liberal and otherwise \u2013 towards the notion of a \nfinal authority in political life is an abrogation of collective responsibility, and with that, of \npolitical agency itself (Bickerton, Cunliffe and Gourevitch eds., 2007). In other words, the \ntransfer of political will from the sovereign state to an amorphous \u201cinternational community\u201d \ndoes not solve abuses of power by the state, but rather dissolves political accountability. In this \nsense, the sovereign state is emerging as just one normative frame within an increasingly \nfractured international political space, one whose normative \u201cvalue\u201d is reducing and, in turn, \ninducing a concomitant watering down of notions of political engagement, popular mobilisation \nand collective action. \n \n11 \n \nThe forum \nTaken together, the four contributions to this forum offer important insights into one of the most \nimportant issues in international politics \u2013 the formation, development and, potentially, the \nemasculation of sovereignty both as substantive arena and as normative frame. The articles are \nintended to be read alongside, but also constructively against, each other. The first two essays \ntake up the problem of the substance of modern European sovereignty by exploring how \nhistorical sociological accounts of the relationship between state and empire problematise, or at \nleast re-contextualise, claims regarding the putative radical transformation of sovereignty as a \nform of rule. The second set of articles highlights both the practical and normative ambiguities \nregarding the contemporary direction of post-Westphalian governance, raising questions about \nthe ethical appeal of alternative forms of rule to the sovereign state. At the heart of all four pieces \nlie major points of contestation regarding the history, theory, integrity and normative \nsignificance of sovereignty: the connections between imperialism and, indeed, globalisation to \ndebates about sovereignty; the degree to which the shift away from national frames of political \ncommunity towards international and supranational bodies induces a sense of public anomie; and \nthe relationship between public and private, political and economic, material and ideational in \nthe origins, development and (possibly terminal) decline of sovereignty.  \n \nIn the first article for the forum, John Hobson examines the extent to which sovereignty emerged \nwithin a European crucible, arguing that the origins of the modern states system are rooted less \nin pristine, endogenous, Western developments than in multiple interactions between peoples \nover the global longue-dur\u00e9e: traders, policy makers, militaries, scholars and so on. This \nexchange of ideas and practices (\u201cresource portfolios\u201d) engendered a complex international \nsphere upon which Western intellectuals and policy makers later inscribed a \u201ccivilisational line \nof apartheid\u201d which divided the world into West and East, light and dark, civilised and barbarian. \nFor Hobson, sovereignty acted as the lodestone for this binary \u2013 where Western powers reserved \nsovereignty (indeed hyper-sovereignty) for themselves, they imposed limited, conditional \nsovereignty on the \u201crude and unruly\u201d peoples of the East. And these practices, Hobson contends, \nendure in contemporary notions of human rights, humanitarian intervention and the like. In the \nsecond contribution to the forum, Andrew Baker extends Hobson\u2019s argument by exploring the \n \n12 \nways in which British identity during the twentieth century was bifurcated between notions of \nempire and national sovereignty. Intriguingly, Baker argues, empire acted to constrain British \nautonomy as rival centres of power \u2013 particularly in the white dominion countries \u2013 exerted \nconsiderable leverage over British policy, including appeasement. Equally intriguingly, Baker \ncontends, state power in Britain only became centralised after World War Two as British shed its \nimperial commitments and became enmeshed in various multilateral (principally European and \nAtlanticist) political networks. Indeed, far from being the exemplar of a rational, bureaucratic \nmodern state, contemporary Britain is a \u201cpost-colonial\u201d invention born from its pre-World War \nTwo imperial experiences.  \n \nBoth Hobson and Baker raise fundamental questions about the origins of sovereignty and, in \nparticular, when and where sovereignty can be said to have emerged. The two remaining articles \nin the forum \u2013 by James Heartfield and Chris Bickerton \u2013 continue these themes. Heartfield \nexplores the decline in national sovereignty in Western Europe since World War Two, \nparticularly vis-\u00e0-vis the emergence of the European Union as a legitimate site of political \nauthority. Rather than encroaching on formal de jure sovereignty, Heartfield sees the European \nproject as filling a vacuum generated by the retreat of national institutions from public life in the \nface of declining levels of trust, lower levels of public participation in formal politics, and \nreduced levels of contact between elites and mass publics. In the final paper for the forum, Chris \nBickerton complements Heartfield\u2019s analysis by examining changes to notions of sovereignty in \npost-communist states since the end of the Cold War. Bickerton demonstrates the ways in which \nEU enlargement and other pressures to \u201cinternationalise\u201d have reduced the legitimacy of national \npolitical actors. As a result, a gap has emerged between ruling elites, formal political institutions \nand publics, one with alarming consequences for the future of participatory democracy and \nactive citizenship in Eastern and East-Central Europe. Bickerton\u2019s piece, like the others in the \nforum, exposes some uncomfortable truths regarding one of the core issue facing scholars, \nstudents and practitioners of international politics in the contemporary world \u2013 the question of \nwhether sovereignty continues to serve as the primary articulation of political rule and, if not, \nwhat alternatives there are to its hold as both substantive arena and as normative barometer. The \ncontributions promise no ultimate resolution to these thorny questions, but they do shed light on \none of IR\u2019s most enduring concerns. \n \n13 \nList of references \n \nAmbrosius, L.
