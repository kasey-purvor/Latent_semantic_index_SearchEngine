Specifically, it calls upon evidence from \nqualitative case studies of three contemporary civic websites in Britain, the UK Youth \nParliament, European Youth Portal and MuslimYouth.Net, including textual analysis as well as \ninterviews with key producers and young users of these and other civic sites. In light of \ncurrent debates around the best means of engaging young people in civic activities on and \noffline, the paper seeks to answer questions about the potential benefits and dangers of \nproducers\u2019 pedagogic styles, ideological perspectives and normative choices in relation to \nyoung people\u2019s civic motivation and efficacy. Finally the paper looks at the match or \ndisjuncture between the sites\u2019 missions for youth citizenship and the actual young people \nwho respond to the sites\u2019 address and ethos and asks how more civic producers can move \ntowards a situated, motivating and inclusive model of communication on and offline. \nKeywords: Civic websites, civic producers, young people, inter-cultural communication, \nparticipation, inclusion. \n \nThe context \nAgainst a backdrop of continued anxiety about young people\u2019s engagement with civil \nsociety (Galston, 2004; Putnam, 2000; Scheufele and Nisbet, 2002) and an evident decline \nin their formal political participation through voting (Delli Carpini, 2000; Gibson, Lusoli & \nWard, 2005), there has been in recent years a burgeoning of civic content aimed at youth \non the internet. The producers of this content include, political parties, local and national \ngovernment, charities, non-governmental organisations, religious and political organisations \nas well as non-formal citizen education sites, information portals and pan-European \nwebsites. In a legitimate effort to question sweeping claims about apathy and civic \ndisengagement on the part of young people, research approaches to civic websites have \ntended to focus on design and content (Gerodimos, 2008; Bachen et al., 2009; Bruszt, \nVedres & Stark, 2005; Macintosh et al., 2003; Montgomery et al., 2004; Raynes-Goldie & \nWalker 2008) and on specific users of particular sites (Bennett & Xenos, 2004; Livingstone, \nBober and Helsper, 2004; Olsson, 2008). The perspectives of such studies are varied, and \noffer optimistic, pessimistic and more realistic evaluations of the internet\u2019s potential as a \ncivic motivator. Macintosh et al. (2003, p. 43), for instance, examine action taken to address \nwhat they call \u2018young people\u2019s apathy to the democratic process and politics in general, by \nconsidering possibilities for using information and communication technology to engage \nyoung people\u2019; Bachen et al., on the other hand examine what they conceive of as the \nfailure of civic web designers to utilise appropriate models of active pedagogy and \ninformation literacy in online civic environments. There has, however, been far less \nattention paid to how conceptions of technology and young people influence the \nproduction of such sites.  \n2 \n \nIn fact, other than the European project Civicweb, (Young People, the Internet and Civic \nParticipation; www.civicweb.eu, funded by the European Commission, Framework 6), on \nwhose findings this paper is based, only work by Stephen Coleman (cf. 2008) consistently \naddresses the impact of website producers\u2019 complex and contradictory beliefs (about how \nsociety should best be governed, about rights, equality, justice and more) on websites\u2019 \ninvitations to citizenship and participation. Indeed, discussions of civic producers\u2019 \nideological frameworks in relation to citizenship and young people, their social concerns \nand financial constraints remain largely anecdotal and decontextualised. This being the \ncase, a number of questions about language, inclusion and exclusion were tackled by the \nsemi-structured interviews with civic producers conducted for CivicWeb: How do the \nproducers of online civic content conceptualise young people, civic inclusion and voice? \nHow do such conceptions feed into or become implicated in the engagement strategies of \nthe website? And what makes some organisations successful at addressing issues of \nintercultural citizenship across socioeconomic boundaries, while others implicitly accept \nthat they are only appealing to a narrow spectrum of middle-class and\/or highly educated, \ncivically engaged young people? To answer these questions, this paper draws on two \nintersecting qualitative sets of data from CivicWeb:  one involving textual analysis of a \nrange of UK youth civic websites, covering issues of content, pedagogy and language; the \nother involving an in-depth qualitative study of the producers of a sample of civic websites. \n \nMethodology and Design \nThe conception of civic action and the civic sphere employed by the Civicweb project was \ndeliberately wide-ranging. It included the websites of rightwing groups; evangelical and \nculturally-oriented religious organisations; countryside lobbies; those advocating anorexia \nand bulimia or supporting people with these conditions; a host of socially conscious, \ninformation, advice, peace and social action sites; anarchist youth sites; animal liberation \nsites and those advocating direct action against fascists or military corporations. While the \nremit of the project was to reflect the views of the full spectrum of producers, with a \ncouple of notable exceptions, those who chose to respond positively to the request for \ninterviews fall somewhere in-between the ends of the spectrum. Design, pedagogy, \nlanguage and address on sites of at either end of the political spectrum are addressed \ntextually in project reports, but less frequently in relation to producers. \nAs evidenced by our survey of websites (CivicWeb, deliverable 6, 2007), the promotion of \ncivic and intercultural communication is a priority for a number of governmental and non-\ngovernmental organizations led by, with and\/or for young people. Sitting firmly within a \nparadigm that views all young people as having an affinity for new technologies (Tapscott, \n2008; Valaitis 2005), some of these websites aim to tap the potential of digital media and \nespecially of web 2.0 features such as video uploads, file sharing, podcasts, forums and \nincipient social networking tools as new means for civic engagement (Civicweb, deliverable \n6, 2007). Other sites rely on what might be termed new forms of political participation \nsuch as \u2018ethical consumerism\u2019 to appeal to young audiences. But the meanings of \nintercultural communication and civic participation are themselves not clearly delineated or \n3 \n \ndefined things. They need to be interpreted in relation to the producers\u2019 intentions and the \npedagogy and the political, cultural, economic and social content of the sites. Here I focus \nspecifically on websites that explicitly state their aim to give young people spaces online to \nexplore and consolidate civic identities and intercultural relationships. \n \nProducer sample \nProducers of civic websites in this study do not all come from the same backgrounds or \noccupy the same positions in their organisation. Some were paid and some voluntary; some \npart-time and en route to other jobs; others full time and working on several projects at \nonce; some were more knowledgeable about the parent organisations\u2019 activities and \nworldview and less interested in web content; some were primarily but not solely in charge \nof web content and development; others had more to do with marketing or training \nactivities and yet others were the organisations\u2019 fund-raisers and liaised with young people. \nWithin the broader sample of sites selected for the project, this paper discusses two \nwebsites that use the language of youth empowerment within more traditional civic \norganizations (UK Youth Parliament; European Youth Portal), and one that has grown out of \nspecific historical and political circumstances(MuslimYouth.net) to give a qualitative snapshot \nof the field. The producers who spoke to us were representing civic organisations with \npublic media reputations. As representatives they were constrained at points to speak in \ncertain ways that befitted their organisations, and as a researcher I was at pains to respect \nthis. All producers were offered the chance to read the transcripts of their interviews; and \nhad editorial control over what remained in the quotable sections.  \n \nTextual Analysis  \nAmong the questions and themes addressed in the systematic thematic, discursive and \nmultimodal comparison of the three websites under consideration are the following: \n\uf0b7 Address: How are the sites\u2019 users addressed, both verbally, visually and \ntechnologically? What assumptions are made about the characteristics (needs, \ninterests, cultural orientations) of young people in particular? To what extent, and \nhow, is the site teaching, selling, or engaging the user in a dialogue about \ndemocracy? \n\uf0b7 Representation: In what ways does the site frame and convey the political issues \nwith which it is concerned \u2013 in particular in relation to notions of empowerment \nand democracy? How are these ideas invoked in the specific act of using online \ntools? How is the civic status of the websites\u2019 mission established and legitimated? \nFinally, I analyse the construction, and potentially unintended production of conceptual \nvariations in the concepts of \u2018youth\u2019, \u2018inclusion\u2019 and \u2018voice\u2019 as embodied in these sites\u2019 \naffordances and address.  \n4 \n \n \nThe 3 cases \nCase 1: The European Youth Portal \nThis site proclaims itself \u2018[a] gateway to citizenship and mobility for young people in \nEurope!\u2019 The word 'gateway' suggests that by stepping through young people will have \naccess to a pre-existing civic identity that is waiting to be claimed. It was developed in \nresponse to the European Commission's 2001 White Paper A new impetus for European Youth \nand launched at a press conference in Brussels on 26 May 2004. At the present date, it has \nthus had six years to grow and change from its initial policy-driven form to become \nsomething more organic and in tune with actual European young people. The portal has \ninstitutional funding from the Commission, and a diverse range of officers working on \neach different Eurodesk site for each country. The Portal offers European and national \ninformation which the team think will be of interest to young people who are living, \nlearning and working in Europe. The fact that those learning and working in Europe are \nincluded suggests that the site at least attempts to face the fact that many of the young \npeople in Europe might not be citizens of the countries they reside in, and might have \ntravelled from other parts of the globe to work or study, or fleeing conflict. The portal aims \nto provide information on 8 core themes, covering 31 countries; and at the time of our \nstudy it was available in 24 languages. This analysis is based on the English version as it \nstood in 2008-9 at which point one of its key functions was a wish to allow young people \nto have their views heard on a range of topics to do with education, the economy and other \naspects of civic life \u2013 through online discussion forums; they are also encouraged to ask \nand have and their questions answered through the Eurodesk Network. \nThe homepage is heavily text-based, with information organised neatly in three columns. \nThe immediate use of 'you' and 'your' in the sentence 'Your future, your say! Tell politicians \nwhat young Europeans need!' reinforces the overt desire of the site producers to hear \ndirectly from young people. Indeed, according to the producer interviewed, rather than \ntalking merely to policymakers, educators or youth groups, as other youth sections of \nEuropean websites might do, the youth portal wishes to address young people across \nEurope, especially those who already or potentially think of themselves as citizens not just \nof their individual countries, but of Europe. While this might seem like an almost \nimpossible number of people to cater for and address, in actual fact, according to the \nproducer interviewed in 2008, it is only a really small minority of young people, particularly \nthose with a specific interest in civic and political unity in the EU or who are aspiring \npoliticians or policymakers, who actually make use of the opportunities for participation \nand contribution offered by the comment boxes, e-mail option and the forums on the site. \nAlthough there is a wide range of issues addressed from economic and military questions \nto those of immigration and education that might potentially generate debate, the very lack \nof specificity in terms of these themes, and the fact that there is little immediate or local \nlinking in terms of their significance, means that many young people apparently do not see \nthese topics as being of relevance to themselves. Another problematic aspect of the site is \nthe formal tone of some of the well meaning rhetoric. Questions such as \u2018Tell us what \n5 \n \nIntercultural dialogue means to you?\u2019 and \u2018What do you feel about inter-religious dialogue?\u2019 \nare unintentionally aimed at not just a highly literate and educated minority but at a further \nsection within this minority who recognise and respond to such formal and policy speak.  \nAttempting to model inter-cultural best practice, the site appeared to offer opportunities \nfor young people to dialogue with each other in the forums and the \u2018tell us your story\u2019 \nsection. However, if one looks for the kinds of voices evident on the English version, there \nis almost nothing available. Those stories posted about education or work in the EU (at \npresent just two in number) are by young Italian women, are rather brief and formally \nwritten, and have zero comments since 2007. This in itself is disheartening for other \nreaders, for site moderators and for anyone thinking of posting content. The producer with \noverall responsibility for content on the site in 2008-9 was openly aware of this problem \nand attributed it to a fundamental difficulty faced by the site. In her view, young people \nfind the site too complex, too text-heavy and also lacking in a sense of fun or \nentertainment. They might visit the site seeking a specific piece of information, find this \ninformation and then leave. In response to the under-utilized forums, and to the \nproblematic nature of hoping to attract generalised youth via highly topic- or region-\nspecific questions, the site has now undergone a rebuild to exclude all forum-based user-\ngenerated content. Although young people wishing to do so are still directed to forums on \nother European Youth networks such as Generation Europe, the portal itself now no longer \ninvites such participation.  \n \nCase 2: Muslim Youth.net  \nThis site was started in 2002 and grew out of the Muslim Youth Helpline which was initiated \nin 2001 by a single young person, Mohammad Syed Mamdani. Concern at rising levels of \naggression from police and White youth across the UK in the wake of September 11 2001 \nmeant that the site was popular from the outset.  Muslim Youth.Net (henceforward \nMuslimYouth) is now an independent charity run by trustees, a dedicated youth team and \naround seventy diverse young volunteers working between three and eight hours a week on \nthe site and the helpline. A team of half a dozen young part-time and full-time paid staff \nupdate content on the site, run off-line projects and look after its day-to-day functioning. \nThis is funded by grant applications to local charitable trusts and to official bodies \u2013 for \ninstance, the department for education, in the government, which funds it under civic \neducation schemes \u2013 as well as the national lottery\u2019s Camelot foundation.  \nVolunteers hail from different communities of Asian, African, American and European \ndescent, from Sunni, Shia and Sufi backgrounds and are of different ages and genders. A \nselection of volunteers interviewed in 2009 confirmed producers\u2019 comments about ethos \nand address. The site's offline work includes the telephone Helpline and outreach \nprogrammes encouraging voting in UK national and local elections and one aiming to \nsupport and educate young Muslim prisoners and their families about the challenges of \ncommunity reintegration after imprisonment. Online activities include a large array of \nrelatively busy forums, with topical political, social and cultural issues debated within them. \n6 \n \nAccording to the producers interviewed in 2007, the site already had two 2900 registered \nregular users and several thousand unique visitors, a number which has grown since and \nspikes during particular international or national events that cast a focus on Muslims and \nIslam. The most active participants in the forums have each posted several thousand times \nsince the forums were launched. \nMuslimYouth.Net states that it aims to provide young people who identify as Muslim in the \nUK with information about contemporary social issues and the potential for engaging in \nsocial support and debate both within and outside their communities. Interviews with the \nproducers and volunteers of this site suggest that children as young as eleven years old, \nread, contribute to and moderate content. This lends the site an interesting heterogeneity of \nlanguage. The website\u2019s editorialised spaces show different strategies in attempting to \ninform and engage the young people they target. The strategy for motivating young people \nto return to the site involves getting them to write about their personal, civic and cultural \nconcerns in articles that are published on the site. The forums are \u2018self-moderated\u2019 by the \nheaviest users: young people, broadly of Muslim heritage, but with a diverse set of beliefs \nand attitudes towards religion, identity, politics and civil society. Acknowledging and \nrespecting difference and diversity is a means to foster intercultural communication. The \ntone of the editorialised areas on the website is serious but conversational, deliberately \nhighlighting the socio-political and cultural differences between young users of the site. \nTake, for instance, this explanation of the site\u2019s swearing policy: \nWhy are swear words used in some of the articles? \nMany young people, including Muslim youth, use swear words to express their \nfeelings and emotions. Whilst we do not tolerate personal insults, abuse or graphic \nlanguage, we are committed to removing barriers and censorship which restrict \nyoung people from expressing themselves and convey distorted, \u2018palatable\u2019 images \nof social problems. (http:\/\/www.muslimyouth.net\/aboutus.php, 20 March 2008) \nThe fact that swearwords and text language is allowed on the site means that when reading \nsome of the posts the \u2018voices\u2019 of the writers may be felt more clearly than they are on sites \nwith a parent organisation\u2019s identity to protect. Yet, interestingly, despite clear differences \nof opinion, there is usually little flaming evident. The statement about swearing which is \nquoted, appears via its vocabulary \u2013 \u2018barriers\u2019, \u2018palatable\u2019 \u2013 to be intended for an audience \nof adults, even potential funders, rather than only young users. While this epitomises the \nsite\u2019s concern with safeguarding the rights of its users, rather than showcasing their adult \ncivicness, there is always a danger in feeling that one has to explain one\u2019s reasons to adult \ncivic authorities.  \n \nCase 3: UK Youth Parliament  \nUKYP is the website of the UK Youth Parliament, which aims to raise debates and campaign \non issues (for instance, such as tuition fees, bus fares and representations of young people \nin the media) that appear relevant to young people in the UK. The website, although \n7 \n \nrunning a number of forums, some embedded videos and UKYP TV, is text-heavy, with a \nfairly high level of literacy demanded by many of the editorial postings. Ideologically too \u2013 \nin terms of the editorial orientation and belief about, for instance, action and rights in the \nsocial, cultural, political and economic spheres - the site appears to cater for those already \ninvolved or interested in governmental and parliamentary politics. It thus serves a kind of \napprenticeship function in relation to traditional politics, both online and offline. Explicitly, \nhowever, the site addresses itself to all young people in the UK \u2013 a wide and unspecified \ndemographic:  \nThe UK Youth Parliament (UKYP) enables young people to use their energy and \npassion to change the world for the better. Run by young people for young \npeople, UKYP gives the young people of the UK, between the age of 11 and 18 a \nvoice, which is heard and listened to by local and national government, providers of \nservices for young people and other agencies who have an interest in the views and \nneeds of young people.  \nNotably, this claim does not explain what \u2018being heard\u2019 might mean in practical terms. The \nforums again claim to offer a chance for any young person to share their views on political \nand civic issues. \n\u2018Got an issue you feel passionate about? Want to get something off your chest? \nWant to meet other likeminded young people? Then the UKYP online forums are \nthe perfect place for you\u2026.Culture, education, health, international matters, law \nand society, entertainment, philosophy \u2013 whatever your issue, you will find other \nyoung people to debate with.\u2019 (10 July, 2010; \nhttp:\/\/www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk) \nThe majority of views and opinions expressed in forums generally appear to represent \nthose from more educated and\/or affluent backgrounds. This is particularly notable in \nrelation to discussions of social issues such as education, the power of schools, censorship, \nbenefits and rights, where, despite some interestingly polarised political debate, and a \nnumber of compassionate or angry postings, a very small number of the participants in the \nhundreds of threads analysed demonstrate insider knowledge of social deprivation. \n\u2018Excluded\u2019 youth do not appear to contribute at all. As the producer interviewed points \nout, there are organisational reasons why this website attracts a certain demographic. \nTL: With the forum it\u2019s kind of been a bit of a stop start process. What makes it \nparticularly difficult, obviously with us, with a youth organisation you just have to \nbe so careful in terms of, on the one hand, child protection but then also with our \norganisation as well because we\u2019re involved in politics if you like, you will get young \npeople who are very, very passionate and that can require a fair bit of moderation in \nterms of young people not getting carried away and getting so passionate that it \nends up in a kind of slanging match and it can always kind of end up provoking \nthose kinds of reactions \u2013 so we\u2019re going to have to be very careful doing that.  \nWe\u2019ve had (a forum) on the website for a year and it\u2019s kind of just taken a gentle \napproach to it so we haven\u2019t necessarily done a load of promotion of that forum up \n8 \n \nto now but we are going to experiment with something in the next two \nmonths\u2026Basically we\u2019re holding an event at the House of Lords [\u2026] and at that \nHouse of Lords event they will be deciding what our campaigns will be for the year \nahead.  [Tom Lodziak, UK Youth Parliament] \nHere we can see that whatever other channels of communication are on offer, be they \nforums or offline events, the organisation exists partly to further young people\u2019s \nunderstanding of the value of what politicians do and of the processes whereby they, the \ncitizens, elect the people who govern them. In this process, inevitably, it seems, the more \n\u2018passionate\u2019 young people, with agendas and strong politics of their own, have to curb their \nmanner and their aims to retain the broader goals, while others are not really being \naddressed at all.  \nFor organisations such as UK Youth Parliament, there is a precarious balance to be \nmaintained between having adequate funding and actually being able to pursue \nindependent sociopolitical or cultural goals and pathways: \nTL: Our core funding comes from the government, from the department for \nChildren Schools and Families [\u2026] It\u2019s kind of always negotiated every year. The \ncore funding doesn\u2019t go very far so we\u2019ve always had to look elsewhere and we\u2019ve \ngot a sponsorship deal with British Telecom and for an engineering company called \nMWH and then we go to other pots as well so a few things like the Youth Charity \n(V) we got some funding from there and funding from all kinds of places which we \nhave to do just to keep it going.  What we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 is to go back to the \ndepartment of Children Schools and Families and to actually try to get a big increase \nfrom the funding which they give us as we kind of feel the work which we\u2019re doing \nis so in line with what their objectives are... \nSB: Do you need to give report backs and feedback to them? Do they demand \nstatistics, number of users? \nTL: Yes, absolutely! [\u2026] \nSB: So it\u2019s not no-strings attached funding? \nTL: No, not at all. [Tom Lodziak, UKYP] \nThis exchange makes it clear that funding is absolutely key in some organisations to the \ntype of experience provided for young people on their websites; it might also be crucial to \nthe sets of beliefs and actions encouraged by the site and thus influence the type of youth \ncitizenship supported. Viewed side-by-side, the overall mission and ethos of the UK Youth \nParliament and its funding context, form an almost insurmountable barrier to engagement \nfor disenchanted, sceptical or disenfranchised young people with low literacy, motivation \nor no existing interest in formal political structures.  \n  \n \n9 \n \nDiscussion \nConceptualisations of young people are linked to the ways in which a diversity of \norganisations try to address them. In the past few decades, as discussed in our UK report \non the production of civic websites (Banaji 2009a) discussions of young people have taken \nplace within a shifting complex of discourses. Some of these have circulated in the public \nand private sector, within NGOs, amongst policy makers, educators and academics, many \nof which employ the rhetoric of \u2018youth empowerment\u2019 (Cargo et al, 2003) and \u2018youth voice\u2019 \n(Mitra, 2003; Matthews and Limb, 1998). \u2018Youth voice\u2019 is generally used to refer to the \ncommunication, by children and young people to the adult world in general and their \ncommunities in particular, of their perspectives, ideas and experiences with a view to \nhaving these taken seriously in various decision making processes. Youth voice has \nconnotations of agency, participation, and even power within the public sphere \u2013 which is \nimagined as a place where people need to speak and ideally should be given the space to do \nso; for some it has the assumption that youth as a group can also speak on behalf of \nand\/or represent each other better than adults do. The word \u2018empowerment\u2019 has a similar \nbut more varied use and history in relation to those perceived to be under-represented and \n\u2018downtrodden\u2019 groups such as women, ethnic minorities and the poor in general. It is used \nto connote the giving of opportunities and skills necessary for confident participation and \nintervention in the public sphere, be this of school, family, community or government or \nsimply to indicate that someone has gained more control over their own life circumstances. \nIt does, however, carry with it other connotations of the giving of \u2018power\u2019 by those who \nhold it, to those who do not, and it is in this context that the term can seem most \ninadequate when used in the youth citizenship field. The reasons for the use of these terms \nis different in different contexts; for instance, some employ it to resist another ubiquitous \ndiscourse, which is that of young people as apathetic, dysfunctional, violent or criminal; its \nuse within commercial rhetoric can be seen as stemming from an entirely different set of \nmotivations, partly to do with capitalising on the idea of agency and self-confidence with a \nview to having young people perceived as consumers. One serious consequence of these \nunderlying motivations and overt rhetorics is a series of mixed messages and unrealistic \nclaims to give voice to groups of people with differing and even conflicting interests \n(Bessant 2004; Vromen, 2008; Olsson and Miegel, 2010). This further disenfranchises many \nyoung people by making it seem that they had an opportunity to conduct a dialogue for \nchange with those in power but were too apathetic or cynical to engage. Likewise, the \nabsence of concomitant efforts to link voice with serious listening by those in power, to \ndistinguish between the needs and wants of different sections of young people when they \ndo speak, or to give them space in ongoing political and policy changes undermines even \nthe most worthy efforts. We are thus returned to pre-existing prejudices and stereotypes of \nyoung people en masse.  \nAmongst producers in the UK sample, definitions of young people varied broadly along a \nspectrum. At one end were those producers who accepted some of the current discourse \nabout young people as the \u2018disconnected generation\u2019. These producers generally wished to \nremedy what they saw as a problematic situation in terms of young people\u2019s lack of \ninclusion in society and sometimes their self-exclusion from traditional political life via the \n10 \n \nopening up of channels of communication between traditional political elites and young \npeople. Into this category fall the producers of UK Youth Parliament and The European Youth \nPortal as well as other organisations such as Catch 21 and HeadsUp. Explicitly these \nproducers suggest that young people should and can be trained to participate in \nparliamentary democracy. Implicitly their websites suggest that once this training has taken \nplace young people will be able to make their \u2018voices\u2019 heard within existing political and \ncivic structures. \nEven producers within more activist and\/or campaigning organisations feel that there need \nto be more opportunities for young people to get the training and the skills necessary for \nmaking their \u2018voices\u2019 heard in the public sphere: \nJW: Youth Voice [now TAGD] is \u2026 based on article 12 of the convention on the \nrights of the child \u2026 which is all about participation and trying to get young people \ninvolved in what we do but also involve them in decision making in the \norganization. [Jessica Wright, Unicef Youth Voice]. \nOther producers view young people as an internally differentiated group, who are \nfrequently mis-defined by the ways in which adult institutions expect citizens to behave, or \nfeel about youth. Mustafa Kurtuldu, David Floyd and Mark Brown of Social Spider \n(Producer Interview with SB) critique the term \u2018young people\u2019 as being almost as unspecific \nas the term \u2018people\u2019, containing a multitude of classes, ethnic identifications, orientations to \nhealth and mental health, gender difference and other personally and socially orientated \nrelationships to politics and activism.  \nAdditionally, some civic producers discuss young people as an enthusiastic but neglected \ngroup of citizens, with an inclination to political discussion and action equal to that of \nadults: \nMB: It's embarrassing, the low level of respect [young people] expect from adults \nin the community. So if you actually treat them with a level of respect I find them \nno more difficult to engage or have serious political or social conversations than \nany other group - actually I find them easier because [\u2026] they're enthusiastic, \nthey're unused to people taking their views and opinions seriously, they're used to \npeople challenging their views and opinions, they are used to being told they are \nwrong, they are not used to people saying \u2018actually I don't disagree\u2019 or \u2018I disagree \nwith you, I don't like what you are saying, but lets keep chatting\u2019. They are not used \nto that. So when they see it, they tend to respond very well. [Malcolm Ball, B-\nInvolved] \nCrucially, in the case of more than half the producers interviewed, I was told that the \ncontent of these sites is aimed additionally or even equally at actual and potential funders, \neducators, and adult stakeholders. Such stakeholders have their own strategic, pedagogic \nand ideological expectations, frequently necessitating the provision of text-based \ninformation on the activities, mission, success and ethos of the organisation rather than its \nweaknesses, conflicts, questions and challenges. This means that more government-\nidentified and institutional organisations are least enthusiastic and most anxious about \n11 \n \nloosely moderated forums, user-videos or blog-style content where such tensions inevitably \nsurface. Additionally, funders demand that civic sites are seen to be addressing the widest \npossible youth demographic; as long as the mission states that all young people are \nwelcome, little is done to ensure that the ethos, culture, language and mode-of-address on \nthe site are widened to include more than the default youth demographic with whom many \nadult civic producers appear to be familiar and comfortable.  \nSome producers were open about their dissatisfaction that they are managing to reach \nmainly an already engaged section of young people from a specific class-base: \nBB: If we\u2019re honest, [the amount of writing on the site] does limit the demographic \nof our website because think about the kinds of people who are going to come to a \nwell intentioned Oxfam site \u2013 they\u2019re probably middle-class kids, they\u2019re probably \nWhite kids, two thirds of them are young women, they\u2019re quite idealistic about the \nworld, and that would be our core audience up to now I would say. [Ben \nBeaumont, Generation Why (since 2009, incorporated in the main Oxfam \nwebsite)] \nProblematically, for several, even acknowledging this weakness in their generalised youth \nstrategy does not mean that they are closer to the kind of inclusivity that is their mission\u2019s \naim.  \nFor others, their audience is delineated by a specific point of identification, such as religion \nor ethnicity, but the subset being addressed within that is fairly broad because the idea is \none of dialogue between different sections of that community, especially its youth: \nSB:  I notice you have a fairly inclusive and broad notion of Muslim youth\u2026 Was \nthere a discussion saying \"we are going to appeal to this kind of audience\" or...? \nAS:  There was not really a discussion\u2026 I think it is because our volunteers are so \ndiverse \u2013 we take people from year 7 [aged 11] and we have people who are 27 who \nare still working here\u2026 [Adela Suliman, Muslim Youth.net]  \nInterestingly, the diversity of MuslimYouth comes about as a manifestation of users and \nvolunteers\u2019 diverse identifications rather than because of a carefully formulated \norganisational philosophy. In the case of the European Youth Portal\u2019s English version, instead \nof giving the impression of Europe as a vibrant and exciting place, as, potentially, the \nwebsites of commercial youth orientated organisations such as MTV appear able to do, the \ndeserted forums (now removed) and sparse, formulaic \u2018stories\u2019 (still existing) give a rather \ndismal feel that is in stark and unintentionally ironic contrast to the formal enthusiasm of \nthe address and the optimistic invitations in the editorialised areas of the site. This \nreinforces succinctly that many aspects of websites\u2019 development and metamorphosis are \nnot planned by producers but contingent on circumstances, such as who takes up the offer \nof the organisation or institutional constraints on the producer team.  \nGiven the situation discussed by Henn, Weinstein & Wring (2002) and by Coleman and \nRowe (2005) which suggests that many young people are not so much apathetic or \n12 \n \ndisconnected from the civic sphere as they are \u2018informed sceptics\u2019 about the ways in which \ntheir political representatives act on their behalf, a situation where a youth civic website is \nusing language and mode-of-address to speak at once to two or more constituencies with \npotentially conflicting interests is deeply problematic. The expressed intention on the sites \ndiscussed of involving and of giving \u2018voice\u2019 to young people in general cannot thus be \ntaken at face value, but has to be seen as a rhetorical strategy that benefits the organisation \nfirst, and then very specific groups of young people while potentially reinforcing the \nconditions of exclusion experienced by other groups of young people. Civic organisations \nseem to address this situation in different ways as the foregoing discussion and the \nparticular case studies suggest. The UK Youth Parliament models itself on existing formal \npolitical processes. Simply changing its age demographic from older adults to young people \ndoes nothing to alter the underlying ideologies \u2013 taken here to mean the site\u2019s orientations \ntowards economic, social and cultural systems and people\u2019s roles and relationships therein - \nand pedagogic principles. This is in no way to dismiss the value of the work undertaken or \nto undermine the commitment of the many young people who do contribute. It is simply a \nreminder that online civic initiatives cannot be seen as inclusive or inter-cultural merely \nbecause they declare themselves to be so. The European Youth Portal\u2019s response to the \ndifficult issue of generating debate and discussion on broad, de-contextualised socio-\npolitical issues from highly specific groups of young people has been to shut down the \npossibilities for user-generated content and point to existing online avenues for debate \nwhich also appeal to middle-class, cosmopolitan and educated youth.  \nSo, what can be learnt from the one case considered which does manage to attract a slightly \nwider social demographic to its forums? While Muslim Youth.net remains frequently \nconservative or equivocal on individual rights in the domain of sexuality and religion, this \nethos emerges somewhat haphazardly from the young people contributing rather than \nbeing thrust upon them by the format and overarching worldview of the producers. The \nsite\u2019s editorial comments focus explicitly on topics that might be perceived as barriers to \nparticipation by the users \u2013 such as racism, ultra-religious diktats, imprisonment, \nIslamophobia, homophobia, class, digital\/media literacy and language issues. By \nacknowledging cultural difference and calling for intercultural dialogue, questioning and \ncritique, the site speaks to very specific young people rather than to a generalized young \nperson, only recognizable to the middle-class youth on whom they are modeled. By \nframing self-definitions of social identity as implicitly important civic and intercultural work \nin itself, rather than for what it can convey to those in power, the site currently side-steps \nsome of the dilemmas into which fellow organizations are drawn. Whether or not this can \nbe maintained, alongside funding, is an important issue.   \nIt is therefore always pertinent to ask whose voices are expressed in online civic spaces, and \nwhich of those voices carry most administrative and formal weight in relation to on- and \noffline power structures. Barriers to \u2018access\u2019 are far more complex than issues of hardware \nand broadband (Warschauer, 2004; Lee, 2008), although these too might prove stumbling \nblocks. These barriers encompass lack of general skills, low information literacy and \nmotivation arising from negative experiences with authority and educational institutions; \nhomelessness; incarceration; a one-size-fits all attitude by internet service providers to \n13 \n \nissues such as language and disability; rigid restrictions placed by school districts on surfing \nat school or college; anxieties by particular groups of parents about the risks of new media; \nfear of surveillance; and negative stereotypes about those who are frequently online. Such \nissues were cited openly by \u2018marginalised\u2019 groups of young people on the project CivicWeb \nas reasons for their lack of interest in going online, even where physical access was possible \n(Banaji 2009b). As other work in the field of online deliberation and youth participation \nindicates (Albrecht, 2001; Cassel, Feriman and Tversky, 2006) building civic leadership \nskills and identifying those who already possess them, are often themes of civic \norganizations. And leadership, like any (civic) activity involving an outlay of financial or \nsocial capital (Banaji & Buckingham, 2009), is by its very definition, not equally open to all \nyoung people. \n \nConclusion \nThe foregoing discussion indicates that civic organisations\u2019 websites need to be analysed \nand understood less in the nature of finished texts and more as changing and unreliable \nexpressions of complex social processes or circumstances, negotiations and developments. \nImbalances in power, under- or misrepresentation experienced by many young people in \nformal political structures are not eliminated by organisations operating online. On the \ncontrary, issues of power and domination which arise in relation to language, culture and \ncommunication, as well as to skills, knowledge and cultural capital on civic websites lead to \nsimilar patterns of disadvantage and alienation for young people online as are experienced \noffline. Some are marginalised, some are frightened; some are silenced, while some do not \neven step upto the doorstep. Invitations to \u2018participate\u2019, engage in \u2018intercultural dialogue\u2019 \nand \u2018be heard\u2019 offered to young people by web producers, however well-meaning, civic and \nsocially altruistic, have to be evaluated in the context of the action, discussion and change \nthat really takes place. And here, sharp disparities are apparent, particularly with regard to \nsocial class.  \nIn relation to the vicious circle of audience appeal, several of the UK and European \nproducers interviewed for CivicWeb expressed unease with the fact that the young people \nthey were reaching were only the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 or in other words \u2018the usual suspects\u2019. \nThey were not reaching those on the fringes of society, those who are really \ndisenfranchised by virtue of their class, race or social status as single parents, drug addicts, \nasylum seekers, school drop outs and homeless or unemployed youth. Indeed, some \nsuggested that in order to communicate with such youth, and to get such young people to \ncommunicate with people from other ethnicities, communities or nations, websites and \nsocial networks do not provide a quick fix; they may, in fact, be deepening the participation \ndivide by giving the already active more access to public space and more practice at \ndeveloping institutional, intercultural civic skills. This, however, was a minority view. The \nmajority felt that any additional points of contact with any young people are always good \nthings, but that offline means as well as old media coverage would bring \u2018excluded\u2019 youth \ncloser to civic organisations and thus to \u2018being heard\u2019 and \u2018empowerment\u2019. It is evident \nfrom this latter view that citizen \u2018empowerment\u2019 and civic \u2018voice\u2019 are not seen as \n14 \n \nincompatible with brief and episodic consultations carried out through institutions \nmodelling themselves on traditional political structures and governed by elite norms of \ncommunication. This view has already been soundly criticised by Sherry Arnstein as \n\u2018window-dressing\u2019 leading to \u2018fake participation\u2019 and allowing power-holders to show \n\u2018evidence that they have gone through the required motions of involving \"those [young] \npeople\"\u2019 (1969, 219). It might be argued that the motives of non-affiliated non-\ngovernmental youth websites are far from being so cynical: however, their funding models \nmake them especially vulnerable to the pressures from traditional political elites.  \nAn unintentional irony identifiable in the case-studies discussed in this paper relates to a \ndisjuncture between rhetorical aims and demographic appeal. The more specifically a \nwebsite binds its civic mission to a particular group or subset of young people, to their \npolitical concerns and contexts, the more it appears able to be able to appeal to divers \ndemographics within that group, de facto creating an intercultural community. The more \ngeneralised and explicitly \u2018inclusive\u2019 the rhetorical construction of young people and the \npolitical\/civic goal of the organisation on a civic website, however, the less the organisation \nappears to be able to motivate or even make contact with young people from deprived and \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, or from ethnic, sexual, political and other minorities. This \nirony is also reflected in assumptions about young people and digital technologies evinced \nby site producers \u2013 where civic sites are technically ambitious without also being attuned to \na range of young people, particularly those with little online skill, literacy or digital literacy, \nthe websites again unintentionally exclude a swathe of young users (Banaji, 2011). Both \nthese exclusionary mistakes (or devices, depending how cynical one wishes to be) are easily \navoidable, should the will to change things exist; this can be done via thoughtful and \nstraightforward information and debate, that acknowledges conflicts (between cultures and \ndemographic groups), and diversities of interest amongst young people and older adults. \nWe do not all come from the same place; one size does not fit all. Finally, however, the \nvery goals and aspirations of numerous youth civic websites in relation to youth citizenship, \nintercultural communication and politics form a more lasting barrier for many young \npeople\u2019s participation (Banaji, 2009b). Intercultural communication is needed even between \nmembers within faith and ethnic communities, not just across racial divides. Further, we do \nnot all desire the same type of world, or agree on the means to achieve change. Our goals \nand needs are not easy to assimilate in a single achievable, altruistic, multicultural global \nmanifesto let alone in a mediated, contested and contextual democratic praxis. This applies \nequally to all generations, and is an issue that those of us interested in social and political \nchange must continue to struggle to address.  \n \nAcknowledgments: \nHere I have drawn upon the highly informative perspectives of the following civic \nproducers interviewed by myself between 2007 and 2009: Ben Beaumont, Oxfam \u2013 \nGeneration Why; Malcolm Ball, Advisor the Young Mayor of Lewisham, B-Involved; Jessica \nWright, Unicef - Youth Voice; Rizwan Hussein, Project Manager and Adela Suliman, \nVolunteer, Muslim Youth dot Net; David Floyd, Mustafa Kurtuldu and Mark Brown, \n15 \n \nSocial Spider; Barry Griffiths, Hansard Society\/HeadsUp; Tom Lodziak, UK Youth \nParliament (UKYP); Alex Sergent, Catch 21 Productions; Irene Handeland, responsible for \nwww.europa.eu\/youth and www.ec.europa.eu\/youth European Youth Portal in 2008.
