INTRODUCTION\nResearch activities at the frontiers of nano-electronics and of biotechnology share not only the common goal\nof manipulating nanostructures on the scale of individual atoms, but also common physical principles under-\nlying the corresponding computational methods. In particular, the conductance of ionic channels (which are\nnatural nanotubes in cellular membranes that control a vast range of biological functions1) can be successfully\ninvestigated using ideas and techniques developed earlier for the analysis of semiconductor devices.2 Moreover\nit was shown recently that the interaction between exposed gate MOSFET transistors and nerve cells is pos-\nsible by doping a membrane with ionic channels,3 this open the prospect of integrating the central nervous\nsystem with computer chips. However, understanding the basic physical principles underlying the operation of\nnano-machinery is still in its infancy due to the extraordinary complexity of the problem.\nIn the context of ionic channels the challenge is to predict the function \u2013 the current of ions of different\ntypes and concentrations through a variety of channels \u2013 from the structure, given fundamental physical laws.\nWe note that many drugs in present use act directly or indirectly on biological ion channels. Thus the solution\nof this challenging scientific problem might have significant impact on applied research in the pharmaceuti-\ncal industry. A number of theoretical and computational methods ranging from continuous grand canonical\n(GC)4 and Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)2 theories to the brownian dynamics (BD),5 and molecular dynamics\n(MD)6\u20138 simulations have been successfully applied to gain understanding of various properties of ionic chan-\nnels on different scales in space and time and with different level of details. The success of the GC and PNP\ntheories suggests that a few basic physical principles may provide deep physical insight into the selectivity and\nconductivity of ionic channels. However, many phenomena, usually associated with single filing of ions, are\nusually missed in continuous theories. The available kinetic theories, namely the full-scale 3D BD and MD, are\ncomputationally very time consuming and cannot provide a quantitative theory of ions moving through a chan-\nnel. Therefore, there is a need to develop a self-consistent approach for the description of the directional and\nionic selectivity and conductivity of the ionic channels, using basic physical principles. It is important that such\nan approach is capable of distinguishing contributions to the channel properties of single ions interactions.

The importance of mechanical interaction with the channel walls follows from\nthe statistical mechanical analysis of pore selectivity4 and they can have a dramatic effect on the transition rate\nin biomolecules.10\u201312\nThe present paper is a report on the work in progress. We introduce a new simplified model of the ion-wall\ninteraction that allows us to include coupling of the ion\u2019s motion to vibrational modes of the pore walls and\nto consider the effect of such coupling on the transition rates and on dissipation in the channel. This is done\nwithin the framework of the self-consistent model of ionic current based on solution of the coupled Langevin\nand Poisson equations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we review earlier approximations adopted in low-\ndimensional self-consistent models of ionic transport in open channels. In the Sections 4 and 5 we suggest a\nnumber of improvements that allow us to incorporate into the model the reaction field at the entrance of the\nchannel and, in particular, to introduce a new simple model of coupling of the ionic transport to fluctuations\nof the channel walls.\n2. ONE DIMENSIONAL APPROXIMATION\nThe starting point of our research is the original system of the Langevin equation for a particle of mass m and\ncharge Ze coupled to the Poisson equation13, 14 suggested in14, 15 (cf.5, 16, 17)\nm\nd2x\u02dc\ndt\u02dc2\n+ m\u03b3\u02dc\ndx\u02dc\ndt\u02dc\n+ Ze\nd\u03c6\ndx\u02dc\n=\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dcmkbT\u03be(t\u02dc) (1)\n\u2212\u03b5d\n2\u03c6\ndx\u02dc2\n= qP (x\u02dc) + ZeC(x\u02dc) + \u03b5\u02dc(\u2206\u02dc(1\u2212 x\u02dc\nd\n)\u2212 \u03c6) (2)\n\u03c6(0) = 0, \u03c6(d) = Vapp (3)\nHere x describes the position of the particle, \u03c6 is the electrical potential, d is the length of the channel, \u03b3\u02dc is the\nviscous friction coefficient, and \u03be(t\u02dc) is Gaussian zero-mean uncorrelated noise. In equation (2), the first term\non the left hand side is the permanent charge per unit volume embedded on the membrane wall, the second\nterm is the charge per unit volume carried by the particle crossing the channel, and the last term is the induced\ncharge. The parameter \u03b5\u02dc \u2261 \u0001p\u0001H2O \u00b7\n2\u00010\nR2ln(d\/R) and \u2206\u02dc is equal to the applied voltage (Vapp) . The permanent\ncharge distribution is one of the main fitting parameters of the model. Equations (1,2,3) are scaled together,\nusing the following dimensionless variables:\nx =\nx\u02dc\nd\n; \u03a6 =\n\u03c6\nUT\n; t =\nt\u02dc\nd\/\n\u221a\nkBT\/m\n; \u03be =\n\u03be\u02dc\n\u221a\nd\n\u221a\nm\/kBT\n; UT =\nkBT\nZe\n; \u2206 =\n\u2206\u02dc\nUT\n(4)\nP (x\u02dc) and C(x\u02dc) are scaled by the inverse of the volume of the channel v0. The coupled dimensionless Poisson-\nLangevin equations are then given by:\nd2x\ndt2\n+ \u03b3\ndx\ndt\n+\nd\u03a6\ndx\n=\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u03be(t) (5)\nd2\u03a6\ndx2\n= \u2212\u03b1P (x)\u2212 \u03b1\u03b4(x\u2212 x0)\u2212 \u03b22(\u2206(1\u2212 x)\u2212 \u03a6) (6)\n\u03a6(0) = 0, \u03a6(1) = \u2206 (7)\nFor sake of simplicity, we set q = e in the scaling. From the scaling, the following dimensionless parameters are\nobtained: \u03b3 = d\n\u221a\nm\nk B\nT \u03b3\u02dc, in which \u03b3\u02dc = kBTmD is the friction coefficient and D is the diffusion coefficient of the\nion. \u03b22 = d\n2\u03b5\u02dc\n\u0001 , with \b = \b0\bH2O. \u03b1 = \u03ba\n2d where \u03ba\u22121 =\n\u221a\n\u0001v0UT\ne can be identified as the Debye length in the\nchannel.\nThe advantage of the original system of equations (1,2,3) is twofold. On one hand the Poisson equation\nallows analytical solution. On the other hand it was shown earlier that the corresponding PNP theory can\nprovide good agreement with many experimental results.2 The solution of equation (6) for one moving charge\nlocated at x0 is given by:\n\u03a6(x) =\n\u2206\nsh(\u03b2)\n(sh(\u03b2x) + sh(\u03b2(x\u2212 1)))\u2212 \u03b1\n\u222b 1\n0\nG(x, s)P (s)ds\u2212 \u03b1G(x, x0), (8)\nwhere\nG(x, s) =\n1\n\u03b2sh(\u03b2)\n{\nsh(\u03b2x)sh(\u03b2(s\u2212 1)), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 s\nsh(\u03b2s)sh(\u03b2(x\u2212 1)), s \u2264 x \u2264 1\nHowever, the form (2) does not allow for the analysis of the reaction field, nor for the shape of the channel\nat the entrance of the pore.\n3. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nBoundary conditions are traditionally a controversial issue in this type of simulation.15, 18, 19 It may be stated\nunambiguously that the electric potential and the concentration are constant far from the pore mouth. However,\nclose to the entrance of the pore the boundary conditions are formed in a self-consistent way according to the\nnet flux of ions through the pore. In this work we will adopt a simplified version of the boundary conditions\nthat have proved to be effective in reproducing a number of important characteristics of the channels in the\nframework of the PNP approach.20 One of the main goals of the further research, However, will be to verify\nthe consistency of these boundary conditions.\nA simplified version of the boundary conditions corresponds to a steady flux towards the hemispherical sink\ncapturing ions at one mouth of the pore (see e.g.1)\n\u03c4arrival =\n1\n2\u03c0cDr\n, (9)\nwhere c is the concentration of particles in the solution, D is the diffusion coefficient, and r is the radius of\nthe pore. Accordingly, we simulate this boundary condition using the Poisson process with an exponential\ndistribution of waiting times between the successive entrances of the ion into the hemispherical sink at the\nmouth of the pore. We emphasize that the probability for two ions to be present in the hemisphere of radius\nr = 4A\u02da can be neglected (see the distribution of e.g. K+ \u2212K+ ion pairs in the solution found 19 using BD ).\nIn the one dimensional approximation it corresponds to the random appearance of an ion both on the left\nand right hand side of the channel. The position of the ion is uniformly distributed at the segment of length r\nwith velocity distribution of the ux component taken from the Maxwellian distribution. To include the steady\nflux of the ions towards the pore, the mean value of the velocity is shifted by the magnitude corresponding to\nthe flux (9) (cf. Eisenberg et al15).\nThe potential corresponding to (8) and an example of a trajectory crossing the channel are shown in the\nFig. 1. Finally, the total flux can be estimated as15, 21\nJ =\n1\nd\n(cLProb{R|L} \u2212 cRProb{L|R}),\n\u2212150\n\u2212100\n\u221250\n0\n\u221230 0 30 60\n0\n10\n20\n30\nt, nsec \nx, A \n\u03c6, mV (a) \n(b) \nFigure 1. (a) Electric potential in empty pore calculated using (8) with negative fixed charge 1e distributed along the\nwall according to Gaussian distribution. (b) Ion trajectory crossing the channel starting at the left at time t = 0, and\nfinishing at the right at t = 35 nsec.\nwhere d is the channel length and the probabilities of crossing channel from the left to the right Prob{R|L}\nand from the right to the left Prob{L|R} have to be found as the result of BD simulations.\nWe emphasize that the results of the BD simulations and of the solution of the PNP equations must coincide\nunless there is some inconsistency in the specification of the boundary conditions. The important difference\nbetween the two approaches, however, is the fact that BD simulations take into account the finite diameters\nof the ions. Therefore one goal of further research will be to verify the discrepancy between the results of two\napproaches reported recently by Moy et al16 and Corry et al.17 To make the comparison more feasible, and\nalso to be able to include within the framework of the same low-dimensional formalism new physical features\nof the ion-wall interactions, we suggest in the present work a number of modifications of the one-dimensional\napproximation outlined above.\n4. TWO DIMENSIONAL POISSON EQUATION\nA more realistic approximation for the electrical force driving the ion near channel axis can be derived by\nnumerical solution of the Poisson equation in three-dimensional space with cylindrical symmetry. In our work\nwe use the Finite Volume (FV) method23 with mixed boundary conditions. In this approach one introduces\nfinite volume elements, integrates the Poisson equation over the volume of the corresponding element V , and\ntransforms the first volume integral into a surface integral using Gauss\u2019s theorem, yielding16\n\u222b\nV\n(\u2207(\b\u2207\u03c6)) dv = \u2212 1\n\b0\n\u222b\nV\n\u03c1(v)dv, (10)\n\u222b\n\u2202V\n\rD \rds =\n1\n\b0\n\u222b\nV\n\u03c1(v)dv,\nwhere \rD is the electric displacement, \u2202V is the boundary of the volume and \u03c1(v) is the charge density. The\nschematic illustration of the channel and one of the finite volume elements is shown in the Fig. 2(a) Further\ndetails, examples, and free downloads of the code24 are available. It is clear that, to preserve cylindrical sym-\nmetry, the ion has to move only along the axis of symmetry, and the fixed charge in the wall must be uniformly\ndistributed in the finite volumes, like that shown in the figure. However, it is a reasonable approximation as long\nas one assumes continuous dielectric constants of the pore and of the solution and the actual atomic structure\nzr\nfinite volume Vij\nion\n(a)\nR\n\u22120.5 0.5 1.5 2.5\nx 10\u22129\n\u22123\n0\n3\nx 10\u221211\nFo\nrc\ne,\n N\nx, m \n(b) \nFigure 2. (a) Geometry of the pore with cylindrical symmetry. Example of one of the finite volume elements with width\nin z-direction hz and thickness in r-direction hr. Ion moves along the axis of symmetry. Fixed charge on the channel\nwall is uniformly distributed in the finite volume element. R is the distance from ion to the flexible ring discussed in the\ntext. (b) A comparison between forces exerted on the ion in the channel calculated using one-dimensional approximation\n(8) (solid line) and numerical solution of the poisson equation in cylindrical symmetry (dashed line). The cylindrical\npore of radius r = 4A\u02da and length d = 30A\u02da is situated between x = 0 and x = 30A\u02da. The potential is set to be 0 on the\nleft and \u2212100mV on the right hand side of the pore in 1d approximation and 0 and \u2212100mV at some distance from the\npore in the case of cylindrical symmetry.\nof the pore is not taken into account. In particular, the distribution of the ionic position within the pore is\nassumed to be sharply peaked on the axis of symmetry.\nAn important advantages of using this approximation is that one may use low-dimensional simulations to take\ninto account more realistic shapes of the channel (including its spatial asymmetry and the presence of a narrow\nneck) and to calculate more accurately the force acting on the ions in the pore. For example, a comparison\nbetween the potentials calculated using the 1-dimensional approximation (8) and numerical integration for a\ncylindrical channel of radius r = 4A\u02da and length l = 30A\u02da are shown in Fig. 2(b). It can be seen from the figure\nthat, although (8) provides quite a good approximation for the potential in the pore, numerical integration give\na more realistic picture especially at the pore mouth. The cylindrical approximation for the solution of the\nPoisson equation can be further extended to calculate boundary conditions for the solution at the mouth of the\npore using PNP theory in the bulk.\nOne of the main advantages of using this approximation is that it allows to include qualitatively new physical\nfeatures into the analysis of the ion-wall interaction while still using a low-dimensional model.\n5. INTERACTION WITH VIBRATIONAL MODES\nAs we have mentioned in the introduction one of the main contributions to the selectivity and conductivity\nproperties of the channel comes from the ion-wall interaction. The forces and pressures involved are very large\nas indicated by estimations based on a mean spherical approximation.4 The importance of the dynamical\nflexibility of the channel has also been investigated.25 We would like to comment in this context that the\ndynamical flexibility of the channel walls may modify exponentially strongly the permeability and the selectivity\nof the channel if the potential barriers influencing the ion moving through the channel can be modulated,\neither periodically or stochastically. In particular, it is know to have dramatic effect on rate processes in\nbiomolecules10\u201312 and on molecular transport.26, 27\nTo include the effect of ion interaction with the walls into the model within the framework of the self-\nconsistent approach outlined above, one may allow a portion of the wall in the form of cylindrical shell (for\nexample an element of finite volume shown in the Fig. 2(a)) to move in the radial direction, while keeping the\ncylindrical symmetry of the problem. This will correspond to a uniform compression and expansion of the finite\nvolume element. If we assume that the flexible element has constant mass M and the change of its potential\nenergy due to the extension is \u03b4U = 12k\u03b4r, where \u03b4r is the change of the radius, then the equation for the\ndamped radial motion of the element reads\nM\u03b4r\u00a8 + M\u0393\u03b4r\u02d9 + k\u03b4r = F +\n\u221a\n2M\u0393kBT\u03bd(t). (11)\nHere we have included damping term M\u0393\u03b4r\u02d9 and the corresponding random force\n\u221a\n2M\u0393kBT\u03bd(t), whose am-\nplitude is related to the damping constant via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The ion-wall interaction is\nmodelled by the Coulomb force F = q1q2\/4\u03c0\b\b0R2, where R =\n\u221a\nz2 + (r + \u03b4r)2 is the distance from the ion\nto the flexible element, q1 is the total surface charge of the flexible ring and q2 is the charge of ion. Eq. (11)\ndescribes small oscillations of \u03b4r that may model the first eigenmode of the vibrations of the cylindrical wall\nthat preserve cylindrical symmetry. The variations of the potential well come from the variation of the distance\nR. Although these variations are very small they may induce exponentially strong modulation of the transition\nrate.28\nEq. (11) must now be solved simultaneously with Eq. (1) where the electrical potential \u03c6 is calculated\nnumerically and tabulated for every combination of the positions of the ion and of the ring (cf.16). This system\nof equations allows one to include into the model new important mechanism of the dissipation of the energy\nof ions passing through the channel. Perhaps more importantly, the model (1), (10), and (11) describes the\nion-wall interaction in a self-consistent way, i.e. the ion passing through the channel may induce oscillations of\nthe wall that modulate exponentially strongly the rate of passage of other ions through the channel. This effect\nmay oppose the effect of stabilization of ion in the channel due to the dynamical pore relaxation self-induced\nby the presence of ion in the pore.25 In particular, if one could find conditions under which the ionic motion\nthrough the channel is only possible in the presence of the oscillations and is blocked otherwise, these result\nwill bear on the coupling of BD simulations with one of the possible mechanisms of gating.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nA novel low-dimensional model of coupling of ions motion to the vibrational modes of the pore is introduced.\nThe model is based on a self-consistent approach to description of Langevin dynamics of ions in open ionic\nchannels. It allows one to include in the simulations a new mechanism of energy dissipation and self-induced\nexponentially strong modulation of the transition rate of ions through the channel.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK), RFBR (The Russian\nFoundation for Basic Research) , INTAS, and ESF.\nREFERENCES\n1.
