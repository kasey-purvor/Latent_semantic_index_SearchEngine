As an illustration, we apply these recursion relations to\nscattering amplitudes of gluons coupled to massive scalars. We provide new results for\nall amplitudes with a pair of scalars and n \u2264 4 gluons. These amplitudes can be used as\nbuilding blocks in the computation of one-loop 6-gluon amplitudes using unitarity based\nmethods.\n\u2217On Leave from Princeton University\n1. Introduction\nThe twistor string description of N = 4 Yang-Mills proposed by Witten [1] has been\nan inspiration for much of the recent progress in detailed calculations of multi-particle\namplitudes in gauge theory. New ideas have led to the development of powerful new\nformalisms for these calculations, most notably the MHV rules of Ref. [2], the Britto-\nCachazo-Feng (BCF) recursion relations of Refs. [3, 4], and the generalized unitarity cuts\nin the complexified Minkowski space of Ref. [5]. Applications of these new formalisms\ntogether with the classic unitarity based approach of Refs. [6, 7] have led to a dramatic\nprogress in calculations of amplitudes.\nAt tree level, new and compact results for scattering amplitudes were derived using the\nMHV rules [2, 8\u201318], and the recursion relations [3, 4, 19\u201323]. External massive particles,\nsuch as Higgs bosons [14, 16] and electroweak bosons [15], have also been included using\ngeneralizations of MHV rules. On the other hand, the BCF recursion relations have been\nso far considered only for massless particles.\nThe first motivation of this paper is to construct tree-level recursion relations which\nnaturally incorporate massive particles. The recursion relations follow from general quan-\ntum field theory arguments, and are valid for any quantum field theory (and also for\ngravity). The advantages of the recursion relations and the MHV rules approaches over\nstandard Feynman-diagram calculations are obvious. Just as their massless parents [3, 4],\nthe recursion relations for massive particles do not suffer from the factorial growth of the\nnumber of contributing Feynman diagrams. Compared to MHV rules, the recursion rela-\ntions give more compact results. They can be rigorously derived for a general quantum\nfield theory and they incorporate massive particles in a natural and universal way. Essen-\ntially, with the general recursion relations in place, one may be able to avoid in future all\nFeynman-diagrams calculations of nontrivial tree amplitudes.\nIn this paper we will use massive recursion relations to derive compact amplitudes for\ngluons coupled to massive coloured scalars. In the forthcoming companion paper [24] we\nwill use the recursion relations for amplitudes with massive particles with spin.\nAt one loop, the MHV rules have been successfully applied to supersymmetric am-\nplitudes [25\u201331]. New classes of amplitudes have been derived with the new methods in\nRefs. [5, 32\u201342]. All of these results give complete amplitudes only in supersymmetric\ntheories which are cut-constructible in 4 dimensions [6, 7]. In non-supersymmetric gauge\ntheories, the new methods apply only to the 4D cut-constructible parts of the amplitudes.\nThe second motivation of this paper is to assemble together the pieces necessary for\nthe complete calculation of one-loop amplitudes in non-supersymmetric gauge theories.\nOne-loop multi-gluon amplitudes in the \u2018all-plus\u2019, and in the \u2018one-minus\u2019 helicity config-\nurations, (+,+,+, . . . ,+) and (\u2212,+,+, . . . ,+), are known [38, 43, 44]. However, the full\none-loop amplitudes even in the simplest non-supersymmetric gauge theory, pure Yang-\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nMills, are still known only for n \u2264 5 external gluons, with the five-gluon amplitude cal-\nculated in 1993 in Ref. [45]. The six-gluon amplitude has not yet been calculated for all\nhelicity configurations. One-loop amplitudes with n external gluons in pure Yang-Mills are\nconveniently decomposed as\nAgluonn = AN=4n \u2212 4Achiral N=1n + Ascalarn , (1.1)\nwhere the first and the second terms are the contributions of the N = 4 supermulti-\nplet, and the chiral N = 1 supermultiplet running in the loop. These contributions arise\nfrom supersymmetric theories, they are cut-constructible and largely known (at present\nall colour-ordered sub-amplitudes are known for AN=4n for n \u2264 7, [32, 33, 37], and the\ncomplete Achiral N=1n is known for n \u2264 6, [6, 7, 30, 31, 34, 35, 39, 42]).\nThe last term in (1.1) corresponds to an n-gluon amplitude with a complex scalar\npropagating in the loop. This is a non-supersymmetric one-loop amplitude and it is not\ncut-constructible [7]. What this means is that the amplitude Ascalarn cannot be fully recon-\nstructed from its imaginary part evaluated in 4 dimensions. In other words, the knowledge\nof the cuts of the amplitude is insufficient to recover the full answer. The answer contains\npurely rational terms, these do not have cuts in 4 dimensions.\nTo regulate infrared and ultraviolet divergent integrations over loop momenta, loop\namplitudes are commonly evaluated in D = 4 \u2212 2\u03b5 dimensions. In D dimensions (with\nnon-integer D), the amplitudes contain only cut-constructible contributions [46, 47]. This\nis because all terms in the result are proportional to D-dependent powers of the kinematic\ninvariants, which give rise to terms like (\u2212s)\u2212\u03b5 that necessarily contain logarithms [46].\nHence, in D-dimensions all amplitudes are completely determined from their cuts and\nare cut-constructible. The price to pay is that we now need to know on-shell tree-level\namplitudes in D-dimensions and work to higher order in \u03b5.\nIn order to determine full amplitude Ascalarn we cut the propagators in the loop and\nput them on-shell in D-dimensions. On both sides of the cut we are left with tree-level\namplitudes of the form\nAtreem+2(\u03c6\u2020l1 , g1, g2, . . . , gm, \u03c6l2) . (1.2)\nThese are the colour-ordered subamplitudes with two adjacent scalars and m gluons of\narbitrary helicities. The external gluons have four-dimensional momenta p1, . . . , pm. The\nscalar momenta l1 and l2 are D-dimensional, they are the loop momenta which we cut.\nD-dimensional massless momenta of scalar fields can be thought of as the 4-dimensional\non-shell momenta of particles with mass \u00b5, such that l21 = l\n2\n2 = \u00b5\n2. Here l1 and l2 are 4-\ndimensional and the \u00b52 term arises from the extra D \u2212 4 = \u22122\u03b5 dimensions [46, 47].\nHence, in order to calculate 6-gluon one-loop amplitudes we need to know tree-level\n4, 5, 6-point amplitudes (1.2) with m = 2, 3, 4 gluons for all independent helicity arrange-\nments. In Ref. [47], the amplitudes (1.2) were calculated for up to 4 gluons with the same\nhelicity. Using the massive recursion relation we will reproduce these results as well as\nderive the remaining amplitudes (1.2) with positive and negative helicity gluons.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nNotation\nWe will be using the spinor helicity formalism [48]. A vector is represented as a bispinor\npaa\u02d9 = \u03c3\n\u00b5\naa\u02d9p\u00b5 , (1.3)\nwhere \u03c3\u00b5aa\u02d9 are the chiral gamma matrices. The norm of p is p\u00b5p\n\u00b5 = det(paa\u02d9). Hence, a\nvector is null if and only if it can be written as a product of two spinors\np2 = 0 \u21d4 paa\u02d9 = \u03bba\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9 . (1.4)\nHere, \u03bba and \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9, are commuting spinors of negative and positive helicity respectively. For\nreal momenta in Minkowski signature \u03bb\u02dc is a complex conjugate of \u03bb, hence \u03bb is convention-\nally called the \u201cholomorphic\u201d and \u03bb\u02dc is the \u201canti-holomorphic\u201d spinor. When discussing\nthe recursion relations, it will be necessary to consider complex momenta. For complex\nmomenta, \u03bba and \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9 are independent complex variables.\nWe will often use a short-hand notation:\n\u03bbai = |i\u3009a \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9i = |i]a\u02d9. (1.5)\nThe invariant spinor products are defined as\n\u3008i j\u3009 \u2261 \u3008i\u2212|j+\u3009 = \u03bb ai \u03bbj a , [i j] \u2261 \u3008i+|j\u2212\u3009 = \u03bb\u02dc a\u02d9i \u03bb\u02dcj a\u02d9 . (1.6)\nHere spinor indices are raised and lowered with \u01eb-symbols. The scalar product of a null\nvector pi with a vector q is\npi \u00b7 q = \u221212 \u3008i|q|i] . (1.7)\nThroughout the paper we use the sign conventions1 of [1\u20133] and define\nsij...k = (pi + pj + . . .+ pk)\n2 (1.8)\n\u3008i|p|j] = \u3008i|a p a\u02d9a |j]a\u02d9 = \u2212\u03bbai paa\u02d9 \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9j (1.9)\n\u3008i|prps|j\u3009 = \u3008i|a p a\u02d9ra p bsa\u02d9 |j\u3009b = \u2212\u03bbai pr aa\u02d9 p a\u02d9bs \u03bbj b (1.10)\n[i|prps|j] = [i|a\u02d9 p ara\u02d9 p b\u02d9sa |j]b\u02d9 = \u2212\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9i pr a\u02d9b p bb\u02d9s \u03bb\u02dcj b\u02d9 (1.11)\nFor massless momenta equations (1.8)-(1.11) become\nsij = \u3008i j\u3009[i j] , \u3008i|pr|j] = \u3008i r\u3009[r j] , (1.12)\n\u3008i|prps|j\u3009 = \u3008i r\u3009[r s]\u3008s j\u3009 , [i|prps|j] = [i r]\u3008r s\u3009[s j] , (1.13)\nand so on.\n1Note that the opposite sign convention from (1.6) is used in QCD literature for [i j].\n\u2013 3 \u2013\n2. Recursion relations with massive particles\nConsider a tree level scattering amplitude of n incoming particles, some of which might be\nmassive\nA(p1, p2, . . . , pn) , p2i = m2i . (2.1)\nSingle out two particles, i, j, for special treatment. These particles can be either massive\nor massless. For given pi, pj pick a null vector \u03b7 = \u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u02dc\u03b7 that is orthogonal to both pi and\npj\n\u03b7 \u00b7 pi = \u03b7 \u00b7 pj = \u03b72 = 0 . (2.2)\nFor generic pi and pj, there are exactly two such \u03b7 up to scaling. To see this, consider\nthe plane spanned by pi and pj. Geometrically, the first two conditions in eq. (2.2) mean\nthat \u03b7 lies in the plane orthogonal to the plane spanned by pi, pj. The last condition sets\n\u03b7 to be in the intersection of this plane with the lightcone. A generic plane going through\nthe origin intersects the complex lightcone at two complex rays. These rays define the two\nsolutions for \u03b7 up to a scaling by a complex number. We now will construct these solutions.\nSolution for the shift momentum\nLet us find now explicit solutions of eqs. (2.2) for complex momenta. We will discuss\nin turn the case when both i, j are massless, when one of i, j is massive and at last the case\nwhen both i, j are massive.\nIf the marked momenta are null, pi = \u03bbi\u03bb\u02dci, pj = \u03bbj \u03bb\u02dcj, then the condition that \u03b7 is\northogonal to pi gives 2\u03b7 \u00b7 pi = \u3008\u03b7, i\u3009[\u03b7, i] = 0, so either \u03bb\u03b7 = \u03bbi or \u03bb\u02dc\u03b7 = \u03bb\u02dci,. Similarly,\nvanishing of the Lorentz invariant product of \u03b7 and pj implies \u03bb\u03b7 = \u03bbj or \u03bb\u02dc\u03b7 = \u03bb\u02dcj .\nCombining these two conditions, we find two solutions\n\u03b7 = \u03bbj\u03bb\u02dci , \u03b7\n\u2032 = \u03bbi\u03bb\u02dcj . (2.3)\nNow consider the case where the particle i is massless and the particle j is massive.\nThe condition that momentum \u03b7 is orthogonal to pi gives \u03bb\u03b7 = \u03bbi or \u03bb\u02dc\u03b7 = \u03bb\u02dci. If \u03bb\u03b7 = \u03bbi,\nthe orthogonality to pj reads\n2\u03b7 \u00b7 pj = \u03bbai pjaa\u02d9 \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7 = 0 , (2.4)\nhence \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7 = \u03bbia p\naa\u02d9\nj = (\u03bbipj)\na\u02d9. So the two possible null vectors orthogonal to both pi and\npj are\n\u03b7aa\u02d9 = \u03bbai (\u03bbipj)\na\u02d9 , \u03b7\u2032aa\u02d9 = (pj \u03bb\u02dci)\na\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9i . (2.5)\nThe case when i is massive and j is massless is treated analogously.\nThe last case to consider is when both particles i and j are massive. Here, neither\npi nor pj is a product of two spinors so the expression for \u03b7 is not as simple. We use the\n\u2013 4 \u2013\ncondition 2\u03b7 \u00b7 pi = \u03bba\u03b7 \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7 piaa\u02d9 = 0 to express \u03bb\u03b7a = piaa\u02d9 \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7. Putting this into the second\northogonality condition gives a quadratic equation for \u03bb\u03b7\n\u03bba\u03b7 \u03bb\nb\n\u03b7 piaa\u02d9 pjbb\u02d9 \u01eb\na\u02d9b\u02d9 = \u2212\u3008\u03b7|pi \u00b7 pj|\u03b7\u3009 = 0 . (2.6)\nThis equation has two solutions, \u03bb\u00b1\u03b7 , which we can find, for example, by setting \u03bb\na\n\u03b7 = (1, x)\nand solving the quadratic equation for x. The analogous condition for the positive helicity\nspinor \u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7\n\u03bb\u02dca\u02d9\u03b7 \u03bb\u02dc\nb\u02d9\n\u03b7 piaa\u02d9 pjbb\u02d9 \u01eb\nab = \u2212[\u03b7|pi \u00b7 pj|\u03b7] = 0 (2.7)\nhas also two solutions. Altogether, up to scaling, there are two null vectors \u03b7 = \u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u02dc\u03b7\nthat are orthogonal to pi, pj . We do not know of a convenient Lorentz invariant solution to\neq. (2.6) and eq. (2.7). This makes the case where both marked particles are massive less\ntractable than the two simpler cases where at least one of the marked particles is lightlike.\n2.1 Derivation of the recursion relations\nTo construct massive recursion relation for a tree-level n-particle amplitudeA(p1, p2, . . . , pn),\nwe first mark particles i and j for special treatment and pick one of the two null vectors\n\u03b7 satisfying the conditions in eqs. (2.2). Following [4], consider the auxiliary function of\none complex variable\nA(z) = A(p1(z), . . . , pi(z), . . . , pj(z), . . . , pn(z)) , (2.8)\nwhere pk(z) = pk for k 6= i, j, and\npi(z) = pi + z\u03b7 , pj(z) = pj \u2212 z\u03b7 . (2.9)\nSince \u03b7 is null and orthogonal to pi, pj , the shifted momenta are on-shell\npi(z)\n2 = p2i , pj(z)\n2 = p2j . (2.10)\nEquations (2.9) imply that pi(z)+ pj(z) = pi+ pj , so A(z) obeys momentum conservation.\nHence, it is an on-shell scattering amplitude of particles with complex momenta and can\nbe computed from the usual Feynman rules.\nClearly, the momenta of the external particles are linear functions of z. Notice that\nthe spinors of massless external particles are linear functions of z as well. In the case\nwhere both marked particles are massless, there are two possible \u03b7\u2019s given by eq.

(2.11)\nThe second solution for the shift vector, \u03b7\u2032 = \u03bbi\u03bb\u02dcj, gives\n\u03bb\u02dci(z) = \u03bb\u02dci + z\u03bb\u02dcj , \u03bbj(z) = \u03bbj \u2212 z\u03bbi .

(2.14)\nIt follows that A(z) is a rational function of z because at tree level, the scattering\namplitude is a rational function of the spinors of massless external particles and of the\nmomenta of massive external particles.\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0001 \u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0001\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\ni j\nr\nr \u2212 1\ns s+ 1\nP\nFigure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the recursion relation. Arrows label the momentum\nflow.\nAt tree-level the rational function A(z) can only have simple poles in z coming from\ninternal propagators 1\/P (z)2. Each propagator divides the external particles into two\ngroups, the particles to the \u2018left\u2019 and to the \u2018right\u2019 of the propagator as illustrated in figure\n1. Hence, the momentum P (z) of a propagator is the sum of the momenta of the external\nparticles to the left of the propagator\nP = pr + . . .+ pi + . . . + ps . (2.15)\nMomentum P (z) depends on z only if the particles i and j are on opposite sides of the\npropagator. We choose the particle i to be on the left of the propagator and the particle j\nto be on the right, as in figure 1. Then\nP (z) = P + z\u03b7 , (2.16)\nand the propagator is,\n1\nP (z)2 \u2212m2 =\n1\nP 2 \u2212m2 + 2zP \u00b7 \u03b7 , (2.17)\nwhere m is the mass of the internal particle. The propagator (2.17) has a simple pole at\nz = \u2212 P\n2 \u2212m2\n2P \u00b7 \u03b7 . (2.18)\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nFor generic external momenta, all internal momenta are different, hence, the locations of\nall poles are different. It follows that the tree-level amplitude A(z) has only simple poles\nas a function of z.\nTo find the recursion relations, we use the familiar theorem from complex analysis that\nthe sum of residues of a rational function on a Riemann sphere is zero. Applying this to\nA(z)\/z we express A(0) as a sum over residues\nA(0) = Res\n(A(z)\nz\n)\nz=0\n= \u2212\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nRes\n(A(z)\nz\n)\nz=z\u03b1\n\u2212 Res\n(A(z)\nz\n)\nz=\u221e\n, (2.19)\nwhere the sum is over all finite poles z\u03b1 of the amplitude A(z). These come from the prop-\nagators 1\/P 2(z) that separate the particles i and j. The residues at finite z are determined\nby the factorization of the scattering amplitude when the Feynman propagator (2.17) goes\non-shell\nRes\n(A(z)\nz\n)\nz=z\u03b1\n= \u2212 AL(z\u03b1)AR(z\u03b1)\nP 2 \u2212m2 . (2.20)\nHere, AL and AR are the tree-level amplitudes of the particles to the left and to the right\nof the propagator and z\u03b1 is given by eq. (2.18).\nHence, any tree-level scattering scattering amplitude A = A(0) can be written in the\nform\nA = +\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nAL(z\u03b1)AR(z\u03b1)\nP 2\u03b1 \u2212m2\u03b1\n\u2212 Res\n(A(z)\nz\n)\n\u221e\n, (2.21)\nwhere the sum is over all channels \u03b1 such that the particles i and j are on different sides\nof the channel, and z\u03b1 is given by eq. (2.18). The relation (2.21) is useful for computing\nscattering amplitudes only if there is an efficient way to determine the boundary contribu-\ntion Res (A(z)\/z)\u221e. The most favourable scenario is when this contribution vanishes. This\nhappens if and only if A(z) vanishes at infinity,\nRes\n(A(z)\nz\n)\n\u221e\n= 0 \u21d4 A(z)\u2192 0, for z \u2192\u221e , (2.22)\nin which case, there is a simple recursion relation:\nA =\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nAL(z\u03b1) 1\nP 2\u03b1 \u2212m2\u03b1\nAR(z\u03b1) (2.23)\nthat expresses A in terms of lower-point on-shell scattering amplitudes AL(z\u03b1) and AR(z\u03b1).\nThe summation in (2.23) runs over all partitions of particles between AL(z\u03b1) and AR(z\u03b1),\nsuch that pi is on the left, and pj is on the right of P\u03b1, and also over all helicities h of the\nintermediate state P\u03b1.\nThe above considerations apply to the case with massive or massless marked parti-\ncles. However, for calculations carried out in this paper it will be sufficient to take both\nmarked particles to be massless. In this case, the necessary conditions for the vanishing of\nthe boundary contribution (2.22) put constraints on the possible helicities of the marked\nparticles i and j. We discuss these conditions in section 4.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\n2.2 Recursion relations: summary\nWe will use the recursion relations to calculate tree-level scattering amplitudes in Yang-\nMills theory coupled to matter fields. The matter fields may be massive or massless and\ntransform in a generic representation of the gauge group. We consider the colour-ordered\npartial amplitudes A = A(p1, . . . , pn), in which the coloured particles come in a definite\ncyclic order 1, 2, . . . , n. These amplitudes are obtained by stripping away the colour factors\nfrom the full amplitude. hence, they depend on the kinematic variables, momenta and\nhelicities, pk and hk only.\nIn the remainder of the paper we will take both marked particles to be massless. We\nshift two massless momenta pi = |i\u3009|i] and pj = |j\u3009|j] of the marked particles by \u03b7 = |j\u3009|i],\nso the shifted momenta are\np\u0302i = pi + z|j\u3009|i] , (2.24)\np\u0302j = pj \u2212 z|j\u3009|i] , (2.25)\nP\u0302 = P + z|j\u3009|i] , (2.26)\nwhere P = pr + . . . + pi + . . . + ps is the momentum of the intermediate particle. For the\nparticles i, j this is equivalent to shifting the spinors\n|\u0302i] = |i] , |\u0302i\u3009 = |i\u3009+ z|j\u3009 , (2.27)\n|\u0302j\u3009 = |j\u3009 , |\u0302j] = |j]\u2212 z|i] . (2.28)\nThe recursion relation (2.23) written more explicitly is (c.f. figure 1)\nAn(p1, . . . , pn) =\n\u2211\npartitions\n\u2211\nh\nAL(pr, . . . , p\u0302i, . . . , ps,\u2212P\u0302 h) 1\nP 2 \u2212m2p\n\u00d7AR(P\u0302\u2212h, ps+1, . . . , p\u0302j, . . . , pr\u22121) , (2.29)\nwhere summation is over all partitions of n external particles between AL and AR, such\nthat pi is on the left, and pj is on the right, and also over the helicities, h, of the intermediate\nstate. z can be found from the on-shell condition P\u0302 2 = m2p,\nz = \u2212 P\n2 \u2212m2p\n2P \u00b7 \u03b7 =\nP 2 \u2212m2p\n\u3008j|P |i] . (2.30)\nWhen the intermediate state P is a massless particle (e.g. a gluon), we can simplify\nthe spinor products involving |P\u0302 \u3009 and |P\u0302 ] as in Ref. [3]:\n\u3008k P\u0302 \u3009 = \u3008k|P\u0302 |i]\n[P\u0302 i]\n\u2261 \u3008k|P |i]\n\u03c9\n, (2.31)\n[P\u0302 k] =\n\u3008j|P\u0302 |k]\n\u3008j P\u0302 \u3009\n\u2261 \u3008j|P |k]\n\u03c9\n, (2.32)\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c9 enter the amplitude always in the combination \u03c9\u03c9 = \u3008j|P |i].\nFor practical computations it is essential that A(z) vanishes for large z, so that the\nrecursion relations do not have a boundary contribution at infinity. As discussed in section\n4, this puts a constraint on the helicities of the particles i and j. For our choice of the shift\nmomentum, \u03b7 = |j\u3009|i], the helicities of the marked particles can take the values,\n\u03b7 = |j\u3009|i] : (hi, hj) = (+,\u2212) , (+,+) , (\u2212,\u2212) (2.33)\nbut not (hi, hj) = (\u2212,+). Conditions (2.33) are the same for massive and for massless\namplitudes.\n3. Amplitudes with gluons and massive scalars\nIn this section we consider scattering amplitudes of gluons with massive complex scalars.\nThese amplitudes are related to amplitudes with massless scalars that have D-dimensional\nmomenta. The scalars with D-dimensional momenta PD can be thought of as massive\nscalars in 4 dimensions. The D-dimensional on-shell condition, PD\n2 = 0, gives the 4-\ndimensional mass-shell equation, P4\n2 = \u00b52, where the mass term, \u00b52, arises from the extra\nD \u2212 4 dimensions of momenta.\nWe will derive amplitudes with 2 scalars and up to 4 gluons with arbitrary helicity\nconfigurations. The amplitudes with the same-helicity gluons have been previously derived\nin [47].\n3.1 Primitive vertices\nThe recursion relations construct n-point amplitudes from on-shell m-point amplitudes\nwith m < n. The m-point amplitudes are connected to each other with scalar propagators.\nUsing the recursion relation n \u2212 3 times gives a representation of the n-point amplitude\nentirely in terms of the 3-point vertices. Hence, 3-point vertices are the building blocks of\nthe amplitudes in the recursive approach2, they will be called the primitive vertices.\nThe recursion relation reduce the task of computing general amplitudes to the compu-\ntation of all 3-point primitive vertices. In this paper we consider amplitudes with massless\ngluons g and massive scalars \u03c6. These can be built from the ggg and \u03c6g\u03c6\u2020 vertices.\nThe three-gluon primitive amplitudes can have \u2212\u2212+ or ++\u2212 helicity configurations.\nThese are the standard MHV and MHV 3-point on-shell amplitudes\nA3(g\u22121 , g\u22122 , g+3 ) =\n\u300812\u30093\n\u300823\u3009 \u300831\u3009 , A3(g\n+\n1 , g\n+\n2 , g\n\u2212\n3 ) =\n[12]3\n[23] [31]\n. (3.1)\n2In particular, this implies that the 4-point vertices in the microscopic Lagrangian are not used in the\nrecursive construction of gauge-invariant amplitudes [3].\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nThe gluon momenta ki are assumed to be complex which ensures that these amplitudes do\nnot vanish on-shell [1, 3].\nIn order to compute scattering amplitudes of gluons and massive scalars, we need to\ndetermine the \u03c6g\u03c6\u2020 vertices. To obtain these, we start with the off-shell Feynman vertex\nof two scalars of mass \u00b5 and momenta l1, l2, and a single gluon with momentum k,\nV3(l\n+\n1 , k\n\u00b5, l\u22122 ) =\n1\u221a\n2\n(l\u00b52 \u2212 l\u00b51 ) . (3.2)\nThe\n\u221a\n2 comes from the normalization conventions used in colour-ordered Feynman rules\n[49], and the + and \u2212 indices are labels for a scalar and an anti-scalar. To derive the desired\non-shell amplitudes, A3(l+1 , k\u00b1, l\u22122 ), we contract V3(l+1 , k\u00b5, l\u22122 ) with the gluon polarization\nvector, \u01eb\u00b1\u00b5 (k, q)\n\u01eb+(k, q)aa\u02d9 =\n\u221a\n2\nqa ka\u02d9\n\u3008q k\u3009 , \u01eb\n\u2212\n\u00b5 (k, q) = \u2212\n\u221a\n2\nka qa\u02d9\n[k q]\n, (3.3)\nwhere q = |q\u3009|q] is an arbitrary reference vector that is not proportional to k. The two\nindependent on-shell vertices immediately follow\nA3(l+1 , k+, l\u22122 ) = A3(l\u22121 , k+, l+2 ) =\n\u3008q1|l1|k]\n\u3008q1k\u3009 , (3.4)\nA3(l+1 , k\u2212, l\u22122 ) = A3(l\u22121 , k\u2212, l+2 ) = \u2212\n\u3008k|l1|q2]\n[q2k]\n. (3.5)\nWe have already noted that the primitive vertices vanish for on-shell real momenta\nin Minkowski space, but are nonzero for on-shell complex momenta. Indeed, the on-shell\nconditions, l21 = l\n2\n2 = \u00b5\n2 and k2 = 0, together with the momentum conservation imply that\nthe momentum of the gluon is orthogonal to the momenta of the scalars k\u00b7l1 = k\u00b7l2 = 0. For\nreal massless momentum k in Minkowski space, the spinors ka, k\u02dca\u02d9 are complex conjugates\nk\u2217a = \u00b1k\u02dca\u02d9. Similarly a real massive momentum forms a Hermitian matrix (lab\u02d9)\u2020 = lba\u02d9.\nHence for real momenta, the conditions laa\u02d9i kak\u02dca\u02d9 = 0, i = 1, 2 imply l\naa\u02d9\ni ka = l\naa\u02d9\ni k\u02dca\u02d9 = 0\nfor i = 1, 2. It follows that the 3-point vertices (3.5-3.4) vanish. For example we have\nA(l+1 , k+, l\u22122 ) \u221d qalaa\u02d91 k\u02dca\u02d9 = 0.\nFor complex momenta the spinors ka, k\u02dca\u02d9 become independent variables. This additional\nfreedom allows us to take the momenta of the scalars on-shell while keeping the three-valent\namplitudes nonzero.\nFinally, we note that the primitive amplitudes are gauge-invariant, even though eqs. (3.4)-\n(3.5) contain explicit q-dependence. Different choice of the reference vector q amounts to\na gauge transformation, hence the on-shell amplitudes should not depend on the choice of\nq by virtue of gauge symmetry. It is easy to see this explicitly e.g. for the (\u03c6+g+\u03c6\u2212) am-\nplitude. The reference spinor qa, a = 1, 2 lives in a two dimensional complex vector space.\nThe spinors qa and ka are independent due to the condition \u3008qk\u3009 6= 0, so we take them as\n\u2013 10 \u2013\na basis of the vector space. Hence a change in the reference spinor can be parameterized\nas\nq\u2032a = \u03b1qa + \u03b2ka . (3.6)\nChanging q, the amplitude becomes\nA\u2032(l+1 , k+, l\u22122 ) =\n\u03b1 \u3008q|l1|k] + \u03b2 \u3008k|l1|k]\n\u03b1\u3008qk\u3009 . (3.7)\nHere, \u3008k|l1|k] = \u22122k \u00b7 l1 = \u00b52 \u2212 l22 = 0 is zero by momentum conservation. The remaining\n\u03b1 dependence gets cancelled between the numerator and the denominator leaving us with\nthe original amplitude.\nIt follows that the choice of the reference momenta qi of the gluons does not affect\nthe amplitude so in principle we could set them to arbitrary values. In the following\nsections, when using recursion relations to calculate amplitudes with scalars, we will find\nit convenient to set the reference momentum of a marked gluon in a primitive vertex (3.4)\nor (3.5) to be the momentum of the other marked gluon.\nIn the following sections we will calculate tree-level amplitudes of the form\nA(\u03c6\u2020l1, g1, g2, . . . , gm, \u03c6l2) . (3.8)\nThese are the colour-ordered subamplitudes with two massive scalars and m gluons (2 \u2264\nm \u2264 4) of arbitrary helicities.\nWhen scalars transform in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, the\n\u2018string\u2019 of fields in the amplitudes must always start and end with the scalar, precisely\nas in (3.8). Using cyclic symmetry of colour-ordered amplitudes, the scalars in (3.8) can\nbe thought of as adjacent. Scalars in the adjoint representation can appear anywhere in\nthe string, i.e. they do not have to be adjacent. Such amplitudes can also be calculated\nstraightforwardly with our methods.\nWe will determine all the independent helicity configurations in (3.8), all the remaining\nconfigurations can be obtained from those via the following identities:\nAm+2(\u03c6+l1 , g\nh1\n1 , g\nh2\n2 , . . . , g\nhm\nm , \u03c6\n\u2212\nl2\n) = Am+2(\u03c6\u2212l1 , g\nh1\n1 , g\nh2\n2 , . . . , g\nhm\nm , \u03c6\n+\nl2\n) (3.9)\n= (\u22121)mAm+2(\u03c6\u2212l2 , ghmm , . . . , g\nh2\n2 , g\nh1\n1 , \u03c6\n+\nl1\n) (3.10)\n= A\u2217m+2(\u03c6\u2212l1 , g\n\u2212h1\n1 , g\n\u2212h2\n2 , . . . , g\n\u2212hm\nm , \u03c6\n+\nl2\n) (3.11)\nwhere . . . indicate gluon fields and hi is the helicity of the i\nth gluon. Equations (3.10) and\n(3.11) follow from reflection and parity symmetry of the colour-ordered amplitudes, and\n(3.9) follows from eqs. (3.4)-(3.5).\n3.2 4-point amplitudes\nThere are two independent helicity amplitudes in this case, the recursion relation (2.29)\ngives only one term for each of the amplitudes, as illustrated in figure 2.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\nl+1 l\n+\n11\n+\n2\u00b1\n1\u0302+\n2\u0302\u00b1l\u22122 l\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212\n+\nFigure 2: Representation of the 4-point amplitude using the recursion relation with 1 and 2 as the\nshifted momenta.\nIn the case of two positive helicity gluons, we have:\nA4(l+1 , 1+, 2+, l\u22122 ) = A3(l+1 , 1\u0302+,\u2212P\u0302\u2212)\n1\nP 2 \u2212 \u00b52 A3(P\u0302\n+, 2\u0302+, l\u22122 ) , (3.12)\nwhere we took the marked particles to be the gluons with momenta k1 and k2. We set the\nreference vectors q1 and q2 of the two gluons equal to the marked momenta gluon on the\nopposite side of the diagram\nq2 = k\u03021 = |k\u03021\u3009|k\u03021] , q1 = k\u03022 = |k\u03022\u3009|k\u03022] . (3.13)\nWe shift the momenta along the vector \u03b7 = |2\u3009|1], so that |1\u0302] = |1] , |2\u0302\u3009 = |2\u3009. Whence,\nthe amplitude becomes\n\u2212 \u30082|l1|1] \u30081\u0302|l2|2\u0302]\u300812\u30092((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) .\nUsing l1 + l2 + k\u03021 + k\u03022 = 0 = l1 + l2 + k1 + k2, this can be written as\n\u2212 tr( \/\u0302k1 \/l1 \/\u0302k2 \/l1)\n2 \u300812\u30092((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) = \u2212\n\u300812\u3009 [12](l1 \u00b7 l1)\u2212 2(k\u03021 \u00b7 l1)(k\u03022 \u00b7 l1)\n\u300812\u30092((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) .\nTo get the second expression we used a Fierz identity. The second term in the numerator\nvanishes, k\u03021 \u00b7 l1 = 0. The easiest way to see this is to use momentum conservation in the 3-\npoint vertex, l1 + k\u03021 = P\u0302 , and the on-shell conditions l\n2\n1 = P\u0302\n2 = \u00b52, k\u03021\n2\n= 0. Alternatively\nthis can be shown with the use of the definition (2.24) of k\u0302\nk\u03021 \u00b7 l1 = k1 \u00b7 l1 \u2212 (l1 + k1)\n2 \u2212 \u00b52\n2 \u30082|l1|1] \u30082|l1|1] = 0 .\nThis leaves us with the final answer\nA4(l+1 , 1+, 2+, l\u22122 ) =\n\u00b52 [12]\n\u300812\u3009((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) . (3.14)\nThis agrees with the previously known result computed by Bern, Dixon and Kosower [47].\nFor the amplitude with one positive helicity gluon and one negative helicity gluon the\nrecursion relation in figure 2 yields,\nA4(l+1 , 1+, 2\u2212, l\u22122 ) = A3(l+1 , 1\u0302+,\u2212P\u0302\u2212)\n1\nP\u0302 2 \u2212 \u00b52\nA3(P+, 2\u0302\u2212, l\u22122 ) .

As before, we mark the gluons with momenta k1 and k2, and pick their\nreference momenta to be q1 = k\u02c62, q2 = k\u02c61. The recursion relation is depicted in figure\n3. For the amplitude with all gluons of positive helicities, the recursion relations have\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\nl+1\nl+1l\n+\n1 1\n+\n2\n1\u0302+1\u0302+\n2\u03022\u0302\n3\n3 3\nl\u22122\nl\u22122l\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212\n+ \u2213\n\u00b1\nFigure 3: The decomposition of the 5-point amplitude using the recursion relation with 1 and 2\nas the shifted momenta.\nsingle non-zero diagram. The diagram with gluon exchange vanishes as the choice of shift\nvector \u03b7 implies vanishing of the A(2\u02c6+, 3+, p\u02c6\u00b1) MHV amplitude.

(3.17)\nThis is in agreement with the result in [47].\nFor the case where one of the gluons has negative helicity we have two independent\nhelicity configurations, each of which has two non-zero contributions:\nA5(l+1 , 1+, 2+, 3\u2212, l\u22122 ) = \u2212\n\u30083|l2(1 + 2)l1|1]2\n((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) \u300812\u3009 \u300823\u3009((l2 + k3)2 \u2212 \u00b52) [3|(1 + 2)l1|1]\n\u2212 \u00b5\n2 [12]3\ns123 [23] [3|(1 + 2)l1|1] , (3.18)\nA5(l+1 , 1+, 2\u2212, 3+, l\u22122 ) = \u2212\n\u30082|l1|1]2 \u30082|l2|3]2\n((l1 + k1)2 \u2212 \u00b52) \u300812\u3009 \u300823\u3009((l2 + k3)2 \u2212 \u00b52) [3|(1 + 2)l1|1]\n+\n\u00b52 [13]4\ns123 [12] [23] [3|(1 + 2)l1|1] .

Vanishing of A(z) at Infinity\nThe recursion relations are valid as long as A(z)\u2192 0 for z \u2192\u221e. This is the case only for\nsome choices of marked particles. Indeed, for the marked gluons i, j with\n\u02c6|i\u3009 = |i\u3009+ z|j\u3009 , \u02c6|j] = |j]\u2212 z|j] , (4.1)\nit was observed in [3] that A(z) \u2192 0 for the helicity assignments of gluons (hi, hj) =\n(+,+), (+,\u2212), (\u2212,\u2212). This has been extended to fermions in [19, 20]. A direct diagram-\nmatic proof for gluon amplitudes in the (+,\u2212) case was given in [4]. Here, we present an\nargument valid for all three helicity assignments of marked gluons putting no restrictions\non the remaining partons3. We also consider the case where one or both of the marked\nparticles are massless fermions.\n4.1 The (+,\u2212) case\nWe start with the (+,\u2212) case for which we will show that all Feynman diagrams con-\ntributing to A(z) vanish at infinity. In a given Feynman diagram, the z-dependence flows\nalong a unique path of Feynman propagators and vertices. The Feynman diagrams with\nmost dangerous z-dependence are those in which all vertices along this path are trivalent.\nThese vertices are linear in momentum so they each contribute a factor of z. Each of the\npropagators gives a factor of 1\/z. A path made of r propagators has r+1 vertices. Hence,\nthe propagators and vertices go at infinity as zr+1\/zr = z. For fermions, the propagator\n(\/p+m)\/(p2\u2212m2) goes like a constant at infinity, but so do the vertices containing fermions.\n3For the (+,+) case, our proof works for the amplitudes that have two extra negative helicity gluons.\nHowever, see the end of this section for a heuristic argument, which removes this assumption.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nEach of the fermion propagators increases the above estimate by a factor of z and each of\nthe fermion vertices decreases the estimate by z. For f fermion propagators, there are at\nleast f +1 fermion vertices along the path of the z-dependence, hence the above bound on\nthe Feynman diagram gets improved by at least a factor of 1\/z.\nThe remaining pieces of the Feynman diagram that depend on z are the polarization\nvectors of the marked gluons. Consider marked gluons of opposite helicity, so that we can\nhave either g+i , g\n\u2212\nj , or g\n\u2212\ni , g\n+\nj . The spinors \u03bbi(z) and \u03bb\u02dcj(z) are linear in z, eq. (2.11), while\n\u03bb\u02dci(z), \u03bbj(z) are independent of z. It follows from eq. (3.3) that for the helicity configuration\ng+i , g\n\u2212\nj , the polarization vectors of both gluons go as 1\/z at infinity. Altogether Feynman\ndiagrams vanish at infinity as O(z\/z2) = O(1\/z).\nIn the opposite case, g\u2212i , g\n+\nj , gluon polarization vectors grow as z at infinity and\nindividual Feynman diagrams go as O(z3) leading to nontrivial boundary contributions to\nthe recursion relations for A(z).\nIf one of the marked particles is a gluon and the other a massless fermion, we can\nproceed analogously. Now the propagators and vertices contribute a factor of at worst z0\nbecause of the fermions. For helicity assignments (hi, hj) = (+1,\u22121\/2), (+1\/2,\u22121), the\ngluon polarization vector goes like 1\/z and the fermion polarization spinors u\u2212(p\u0302j) = \u03bb\na\nj\nand u+(p\u0302i) = \u03bb\u02dc\na\u02d9\ni are independent of z. Hence the shifted amplitude vanishes at infinity for\nthe assignment (hi, hj) = (+,\u2212).\n4.2 The (+,+) and (\u2212,\u2212) cases\nThe (hi, hj) = (+,+) case cannot be treated by counting powers of z in individual Feynman\ndiagrams and requires a more elaborate argument along the lines of [22]. The argument\nworks for amplitudes that, besides gluons g+i , g\n+\nj have two extra negative helicity gluons\ng\u2212k , g\n\u2212\nl , hence in particular it works for all QCD gluon amplitudes since at tree level, the\ngluon amplitudes always have at least two gluons of both helicities.\nConsider the function A(\u03bbm(z), \u03bb\u02dcm(z)) constructed from the scattering amplitude A\nby shifting the spinors\n|i\u3009 = |i\u3009+ z|k\u3009+ z|l\u3009\n|k] = |k]\u2212 z|i]\n|l] = |l]\u2212 z|i] (4.2)\nwhile keeping |i], |k\u3009 and |l\u3009 unshifted. The shifts (4.2) maintain momentum conservation,\nso A(z) can be computed from usual Feynman diagrams.\nNote that the function A(z) vanishes at infinity. As in the previous case, we prove\nthis by studying the most dangerous Feynman diagrams. The z-dependence flows along\na \u2018three-legged path\u2019 of Feynman propagators and vertices, with each leg ending at one\nof the external gluons i, k, l This path is illustrated in figure 5. For a path consisting of\nr propagators, there are r + 1 vertices. For large z, the propagators and vertices give a\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nzr+1\/zr = z contribution to the z-dependence of A(z). The polarization vectors of each of\nthe gluons give a factor of 1\/z so the function A(z) vanishes for large z as O(1\/z2).\nHence, following the discussion of recursion relations in section 2, we have\nA =\n\u2211\n\u03b1,h\nAL(z\u03b1,\u2212P\u03b1(z\u03b1)h) 1\nP 2\u03b1 \u2212m2\u03b1\nAR(z\u03b1, P\u03b1(z\u03b1)\u2212h) , (4.3)\nwhere the summation is over partitions of the particles into two sets L,R such that i \u2208 L\nand at least one of j, k is in R, and also over helicities of the intermediate state P\u03b1.\nThe amplitudes AL,AR are evaluated at\nz\u03b1 =\nP 2\u03b1 \u2212m2\u03b1\n\u3008k|P\u03b1|i] + \u3008l|P\u03b1|i] . (4.4)\nSimilar recursion relations with three or more marked particles have been recently consid-\nered in [21, 22, 38].\ni+\nk\u2212\nl\u2212\nFigure 5: In a Feynman diagram with marked particles i, k, l, the z dependence flows along a\nunique three-legged path of propagators and vertices.\nWe will use this expression for A in an induction proof of the recursion relations with\n(hi, hj) = (+,+). We consider the function A(y) with\n|i\u3009 = |i\u3009+ y|j\u3009 |j] = |j]\u2212 y|i] (4.5)\nand estimate the y dependence of A(y) with the help of eq. (4.3). For a partition \u03b1 such\nthat i, j are both in L, neither P\u03b1 nor z\u03b1 depend on y. So the entire y dependence comes\nfrom AL. But AL has fewer particles than A so by induction hypothesis it vanishes as y\ngoes to infinity.\nThe other case with i \u2208 L, j \u2208 R is more subtle. We have P\u03b1(y) = P\u03b1 + y\u03bbj\u03bb\u02dci so zl\ndepends linearly on y\nz\u03b1 =\nP 2\u03b1 \u2212 y \u3008j|P\u03b1|i]\u2212m2\u03b1\n\u3008k|P\u03b1|i] + \u3008l|P\u03b1|i] . (4.6)\nWe represent the on-shell amplitudes AL,AR as a sum of Feynman diagrams. The y\ndependence flows along a four-legged tree with each leg of the tree ending at one of the\ngluons i, j, k, l. A tree composed of r propagators (one of which is the propagator connecting\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nAL andAR), contains r+1 vertices. The most dangerous contribution comes from Feynman\ndiagrams in which the r + 1 vertices are three-point vertices that each give a factor of y.\nHence, the propagators give a factor of 1\/yr and the vertices a factor of yr+1.\nThe polarization vectors of the gluons i, k, l each give a factor of 1\/y and that of the\ngluon j a factor of y, so altogether we have 1\/y2 coming from the polarization vectors.\nThere are two more \u2018external\u2019 particles with y dependent momentum. These come from\nthe ends of the internal line connecting AL and AR. They contribute\n\u2211\nh \u01eb\nh\u01eb\u2212h which, in\na convenient gauge, goes like a constant at infinity. For example for a gluon we have\n\u2211\nh=\u00b1\n\u01ebh\u00b5\u01eb\n\u2212h\n\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212\nP\u00b5q\u03bd + P\u03bdq\u00b5\nP \u00b7 q , (4.7)\nwhere P = P\u03b1(y) and q is the reference momentum of the internal gluon. For large y, this\nis independent of y. Hence, A(y) vanishes as O(yr+1\/(yry2)) = O(1\/y) for large y.\nIn this proof, we have assumed that the amplitude has besides the two marked positive\nhelicity gluons i, j also two negative helicity gluons k, l. However we believe that this\nrestriction is not necessary. Heuristically, one can argue as follows. Consider any amplitude\nA without imposing the restriction that it contains two negative helicity gluons. We can\nconstruct an \u2018auxiliary\u2019 amplitude A\u2032 which, besides external particles present in A also\nhas two extra negative helicity gluons k, l. In the previous argument, we demonstrated that\nA\u2032(y) with marked gluons i, j vanishes for large y as O(1\/y). One can imagine taking soft\ngluon limit pl, pk \u2192 0 to recover the original amplitude. Taking the soft limit gives back a\nuniversal factor, times an amplitude with the gluon removed. The universal factor depends\non the momentum of the soft gluon and of the possible adjacent particles. Hence, as long\nas the \u2018auxiliary\u2019 gluons k, l are not adjacent to the marked gluons i, j, their soft factors are\ny independent. So the y asymptotic of the amplitude A with gluons k, l removed should\nbe the same as that of A\u2032.\n5. Summary\nIn this paper we have constructed tree-level recursion relations valid in any quantum field\ntheory which naturally incorporate massive particles. As an application, we focus on scalar\nparticles. However, there is no obstacle in applying our general method to massive particles\nwith spin. With the general recursion relations in place, one may be able to avoid in future\nall Feynman-diagrams calculations of nontrivial tree amplitudes.\nAs a first application of these recursion relations, we have derived expressions for\nscattering amplitudes involving a pair of massive scalars and up to four gluons. Explicit\nresults are given in Section 3. These compact analytic expressions for amplitudes may be\nuseful in deriving the one-loop six gluon amplitudes in QCD using the unitarity method of\nBern et al [46, 47].\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank F.
