The MIST and UK solar physics com-\nmunity met at the NAM on 14 April in a session \norganized by Dave Williams and Colin Forsyth \nof Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University \nCollege London, to discuss plans for the future \n\u2013 in particular to stress that young research-\ners need to be the driving force behind future \nspace missions. A key message was that, with a \npotential European Space Agency call for mis-\nsion suggestions being between 6 and 18 months \naway, ideas need to be developed now. Here we \nreport on discussion during the meeting and \nhow young researchers can play a part. \nState of the art\nThe session was split into two. The first part was \ncalled \u201cThe State of the Art\u201d and reviewed the \ncurrent status of UK involvement in upcoming \ninternational missions. These missions are in \ncollaboration with ESA, including ESA\u2019s Cos-\nmic Vision programme which runs from 2015 \nto 2025, and with NASA.\nFirst on the agenda was a mission that was \nlaunched in February this year: NASA\u2019s Solar \nDynamics Observatory. Robert Walsh (Univer-\nsity of Central Lancashire) told how the space-\ncraft, which carries UK cameras on two of the \nthree telescopes and has UK co-investigators, \nwill have its huge data volumes (over 1 Tb\/day) \nstored in a UK data centre hosted at the Univer-\nsity of Central Lancashire. This centre is vital \nfor ensuring that UK scientists have access to \ndata that will advance our understanding of \nhow solar EUV variability affects the Earth\u2019s \natmosphere and climate, the origin of solar \nactivity and how magnetic variability \naffects space weather. SDO is part \nof NASA\u2019s \u201cLiving with a Star\u201d \nprogramme and is the culmi-\nnation of 15 years\u2019 study of \nthe Sun and its impact on the \nEarth. It gives the opportu-\nnity to both \u201cnowcast\u201d and \nforecast the effects of solar \nEUV variability on geospace. \nEnsuring UK scientists have \naccess to this data is crucial to allow \nus to keep working at the forefront of solar \nand STP science. \nMoving on to future missions, Richard \nMarsden (ESA) discussed Solar Orbiter, an ESA \nmission designed to study the link between the \nSun and the inner heliosphere. This region is \nthe \u201cmissing link\u201d in fully understanding how \nthe Sun creates and controls the heliosphere \nin which we live. During the Space Age much \nprogress has been made in understanding the \norigin and evolution of the Sun\u2019s dynamic \natmosphere and its emissions of plasma, mag-\nnetic field and energetic particles, which ulti-\nmately propagate out to form the heliosphere. \nHowever, the Sun\u2013heliosphere link lies close to \nthe Sun in the inner heliosphere, which is hard \nto reach with in situ spacecraft. Solar Orbiter \nwill study this region and has key UK involve-\nment in both remote sensing and in situ instru-\nments. Solar Orbiter will be placed in an orbit \nthat will allow it to answer these key science \nquestions, including having a view of the Sun\u2019s \npolar regions from its inclined orbit. The mission \nbuilds on lessons learned from SOHO and will \nallow the UK to make technological advances \nthrough the instruments it will supply. The UK \nis involved through the Extreme Ultraviolet \nImager, the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer, \nthe Magnetometer and the Solar Wind Plasma \nAnalyser. Solar Orbiter is one of three proposed \nESA missions in \u201cdefinition phase\u201d; only two \nwill be chosen for implementation, in mid-2011, \nwith a launch date of 2017.\nMichelle Dougherty (Imperial College, Lon-\ndon) discussed the Europa\u2013Jupiter System Mis-\nsion (EJSM), which will study Jupiter and its \nmoons Europa and Ganymede, moons that have \nbeen shown to be more like worlds in their own \nright. The mission will consist of two separately \nlaunched spacecraft, which together will study \nGanymede and Europa as potential habitats for \nlife, determining their suitability and extending \nthe search for extinct or extant life in the solar \nsystem beyond Mars for the first time. The mis-\nsion will also look at the coupling of the moons \nto Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere and atmosphere. \nNASA is leading the Jupiter Europa Orbiter and \nESA is leading the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. \nThere is a possibility that the Japanese Space \nAgency may also contribute a third spacecraft. \nThe UK plans to have a strong involvement \nthrough the provision of a magnetom-\neter and plasma analyser. EJSM \nis a joint ESA\/NASA mission \nscheduled for launch in 2020.\nCloser to home, Mike Hap-\ngood (Rutherford Appleton \nLaboratory) addressed the \ncurrent challenges in magnet-\nosphere\u2013ionosphere science \nand potential opportunities in \nupcoming years. There exist many \nunanswered questions regarding the \nenergization of the Earth\u2019s radiation belts, \nwhich were first discovered more than 50 years \nago, the coupling between the plasmasphere, \nionosphere and atmosphere and the coupling of \nthe solar wind to the outer magnetosphere. The \nESA Cluster mission, which studies the Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic field and plasma environment, is \nLooking ahead\nfor space science\nMeetinG report A joint UKSP\/MIST missions forum was held as part \nof this year\u2019s National Astronomy Meeting. It was a lively session with \ndiscussion focused on current and future mission plans in the area of \nheliospheric physics, and on how young researchers can be involved. \nLucie Green, Colin Forsyth and Jim Wild report.\n\u2018\u2018With a potential ESA \ncall for mission \nsuggestions being 6\u201318 \nmonths away, ideas \nmust be developed \nnow\u2019\u2019\n1: Solar Dynamics Observatory has only \njust delivered first light, but now is the \ntime to plan its replacement.

ESA has extended the mission, but \nUK involvement, which was achieved through \nthe supply of the PEACE instruments, is being \nwithdrawn by STFC and will end in 2011.\nOther opportunities in STP include Swarm, \nan ESA Earth observation mission consisting of \nthree satellites, which will study the evolution \nof the geomagnetic field and is due for launch \nin 2012. Galileo, the European GPS constella-\ntion scheduled for 2014, will carry radiation \nmonitors on each spacecraft to determine the \naccuracy and quality of the GPS signal, the data \nfrom which will be important for research. Even \nthough there is no UK hardware involvement \non these missions there are, of course, science \nopportunities. The Radiation Belt Storm Probes \nis a NASA mission to be launched in 2012 with \nUK co-investigator involvement through the \nBritish Antarctic Survey and the Rutherford \nAppleton Laboratory. The mission will be \nstudying the Earth\u2019s radiation belts, a key region \nfor understanding space weather events and a \nregion where many spacecraft operate at risk of \nthe particle environment. \nFuture opportunities\nThe second part of the session was dedicated to \n\u201cFuture Opportunities\u201d and took the form of \nan open community discussion on future mis-\nsions and opportunities within, and beyond, \nthe current Cosmic Vision programme. It was \nchaired by Jim Wild (Lancaster University) and \nLucie Green (UCL\u2013MSSL). Missions currently \nplanned will take us to somewhere in the region \nof 2026 to 2029. Solar Orbiter is due to launch \nin 2017 with a nominal lifetime of six years, \ngiving a mission end-date of 2023 (the extended \nmission is until 2026). The Europa\u2013Jupiter Sys-\ntem Mission has a nominal launch date of 2020 \nand a mission end in 2029. With the timescale \nfrom mission concept to launch being around \n15 years, now is the time to be thinking about \nscience to be addressed beyond Solar Orbiter \nand EJSM. Indeed, 15 years should be taken as a \nminimum \u2013 after all, the timescale from concept \nto operations for Cluster was 36 years! \nESA\u2019s Cosmic Vision programme was designed \nto address four main science questions:\n\u25cf  What are the conditions for planet formation \nand the emergence of life?\n\u25cf  How does the solar system work?\n\u25cf  What are the fundamental physical laws of \nthe universe?\n\u25cf  How did the universe originate and what is \nit made of?\nSolar system scientists of all disciplines need \nto be asking: what missions should be launched \nin 2030 to address the physics questions of the \nheliosphere that we have today? Then we need \nto consider how they fit within these themes.\nESA launches a range of missions which are \ncategorized as M-class (budget \u00a30.5bn) and \nL-class (\u00a31bn) but the role of small satellites such \nas Cubesats should be considered too. What was \nclear in the discussion is that there is a real need \nto see younger scientists getting opportunities \nto be trained and become involved in the next \ngeneration of missions. One way to achieve this \nmight be through a widespread guest investiga-\ntors programme or through the UK\u2019s Cubesat \nnetwork, which aims to link together those \ninterested in small satellites that can deliver \nnew  technologies at low cost. \nWhat would the future look like with no \nUK hardware involvement in mis-\nsions studying heliospheric phys-\nics? Well, it is certain that we \nneed a steady flow of projects \nto retain the highly skilled \nworkforce that we currently \nhave. A drought in instru-\nments would mean a loss \nof engineers; starting from \nscratch later would have serious \nimplications for future hardware. \nThe UK is at the front of many areas of \nhardware development, which means countries \nsuch as China and Japan are keen to have UK \ninvolvement, giving us a seat at the table and the \nopportunity to influence the science direction \nof missions such as Hinode. In order to con-\ntinue these relationships we need to maintain \nthe momentum that is crucial for technology \ndevelopment. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that \ntechnology development is in turn crucial for \nsuccessful mission proposals. Missions drive \nthe science being addressed and if we want to \nbe setting the scientific agenda, we need the UK \nto supply hardware. \nWhat do individuals gain from mission \ninvolvement? From a science point of view \nit could be considered that having an instru-\nment is as good as it gets. The time investment \nis greatly outweighed by the science benefits \nthat come from truly understanding an instru-\nment and the data it produces: you know the \ninstrument limitations, what it can and can\u2019t \ndo, and therefore how to interpret the data. \nGetting involved with ongoing projects means \nthat you might be the right person in the right \nplace at the right time to take on the principal \ninvestigator role, and being a PI means you get \nto create an instrument to help answer the sci-\nence questions that you want to answer. This \nkeeps you at the forefront of your research \narea and ensures that international teams \nare contributing to science that you consider \nimportant. Certainly being a PI also allows the \ndevelopment of key skills such as management, \nnetworking and negotiation, and leads to both \nscientific and technical leadership.\nWith the next Cosmic Vision call for M-class \nmission ideas likely to be somewhere between \n6 and 18 months away, now is the time to act. If \nyou are interested in coming up with new ideas, \ndon\u2019t be blinded by what has been done already. \nStart with a compelling science question and \ndevelop it to the point where you can defend \nit, and start to build community interest and \nsupport. Ultimately it is the science that sells \nthe mission, so it needs to be exciting, timely \nand relevant. Think about the opportunities \nin your area \u2013 maybe the recent discovery of \nwater ice on the surface of an asteroid could \nlead to the perfect next mission? Talk to people \nwho have experience in different areas and who \nare already involved in mission development. \nYou are not alone! Things to consider \nare connections and synergies \nbetween missions so that you \ncan maximize your science \noutcomes. This will make \nyour mission more appeal-\ning when trying to convince \nESA. In hard financial times \nbeing over-ambitious might \nnot be wise, but if you don\u2019t try \nyou\u2019ll never know. Think about \nwhat you need for your science ques-\ntions to be answered. Is it going to need a new \norbit, like Solar Orbiter? Is it using multiple \nspacecraft, like Cluster? Or is it developing \nnew instruments?\nThe creation of the UK Space Agency presents \nus with exciting opportunities for the future. \nThere is potential for the UK to influence ESA\u2019s \nmission strategy and the possibility of bilateral \nmissions means we can capitalize on new sci-\nence opportunities. Bilateral involvement places \nthe UK in a great position to be ready to respond \nwhen ESA considers the bigger missions. \nA community meeting will be held at the start \nof the summer, so keep an eye out in the com-\nmunity news for the announcement of the date. \nCome ready with ideas and ready to meet other \nmembers of the community who can help. \u25cf \nLucie Green (lmg@mssl.ucl.ac.uk) Colin Forsyth, \nMSSL-UCL; Jim Wild, University of Lancaster.\n\u2018\u2018From a science point \nof view it could be \nconsidered that having \nan instrument is  \nas good as it \ngets\u2019\u2019\n2: The Europa\u2013Jupiter System Mission may tell \nus how thick Europa\u2019s ice shell is.
