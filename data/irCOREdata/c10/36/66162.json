Slater argued for quantum-\nmechanical rigor, and the primacy of fundamental principles in models of chemical\nbonding. Coulson emphasized systematic explanatory power within chemistry, and\ncontinuity with existing chemical explanations. I relate these views to the epistemic\ncontexts of their disciplines.\n1. Introduction. In 1929, not long after the birth of quantum mechanics,\nP. A. M. Dirac claimed confidently that\nThe underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory\nof a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus com-\npletely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application\nof these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble.\nIt therefore becomes desirable that approximate methods of applying\nquantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an ex-\nplanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without\ntoo much computation. (1929, 714)\nNow Dirac\u2019s call can be answered with different kinds of activity. On the\none hand, the problem situation\u2014the intractability of exact quantum\nmechanics\u2014suggests that the novelty he mentions will be mathematical,\nteasing out structure that is in some sense \u201calready there\u201d in the exact\nequations. On the other hand, the phrase \u201capproximate methods of ap-\nplying quantum mechanics\u201d might suggest some descriptive novelty. The\n\u201cwhole of chemistry,\u201d of course, includes polyatomic molecules, which\npresent a new order of complexity. Perhaps new, more tractable kinds of\n\u2020To contact the author, please write to: Department of Philosophy, University of\nDurham, Durham DH1 3HN, UK; e-mail: r.f.hendry@durham.ac.uk.\n\u2021Research towards this paper, and my attendance at the PSA meeting were supported\nfinancially by the Leverhulme Trust and the British Academy.\nPRAGMATICS OF EXPLANATION 1049\nmodel will be required to understand the behavior of polyatomic mole-\ncules, not directly related to the successful treatments of the hydrogen\natom. Views on which of these two approaches should be taken by the\nnew discipline of quantum chemistry did not divide along disciplinary\nlines. Nevertheless, I call them the views from physics and chemistry\nrespectively, for the issue is one of autonomy and authority. Should mo-\nlecular quantum mechanics be regarded as a descriptively complete import\nfrom physics? Or may quantum mechanics be adapted as required to the\nexplanatory demands of chemistry? In what follows I will attempt to fill\nout the details of these two positions through the methodological reflec-\ntions of John Clarke Slater and Charles Coulson.\nIn fact, the early 1930s brought two approximation schemes that prom-\nised workable results for molecules. Both were based on approximations\nconceived in Europe in the late 1920s, and elaborated in the US in the\n1930s. The Heitler-London-Pauling-Slater valence-bond method modeled\nwavefunctions for molecules as superpositions of states corresponding to\nclassically bonded structures. The resulting quantum-mechanical states\nwere \u2018resonance hybrids\u2019 of the canonical structures from which they were\nformed. The Hund-Mulliken molecular-orbital approach built up delo-\ncalized molecular orbitals from available atomic orbitals. The ensuing\ndebate between defenders of the two schemes complicates and enriches\ndiscussion of the above issue, for it also occasioned frequent appeal to\ngeneral epistemic principles and values.\n2. The View from Physics: Slater. It is perhaps natural for theoretical\nphysicists to see the application of physical theories to chemical systems\nas an imperialist process in which a lawless domain that borders physics\nis brought to order: so natural in fact, that the hubris of some physicists\npredated the emergence of quantum mechanics. In a presentation of \u2018old\u2019\nquantum-theoretic atomic models published well before the advent of\nquantum mechanics, Max Born commented that\nWhen we contemplate the path by which we have come we realize\nthat we have not penetrated far into the vast territory of chemistry;\nyet we have travelled far enough to see before us in the distance the\npasses which must be traversed before physics can impose her laws\nupon her sister science. (Born, quoted in Nye 1993, 229)\nNow it would be natural to expect those who played only a distant part\nin the development of quantum chemistry to take a loftily ambitious view\nof what quantum mechanics could explain in chemistry. But John Clarke\nSlater, one of the architects of the valence-bond approach, was similarly\nconvinced of the primacy of fundamental physical principles.\nAfter completing a Ph.D. at Harvard under P. W. Bridgman, Slater\n1050 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nworked with Bohr in Copenhagen in the academic year 1923\u20131924 (Hod-\ndeson 1990). On his return from Europe, Slater made, during the late\n1920s and early 1930s, a slew of important contributions to the quantum\nmechanical theory of many-electron systems, and of molecular structure\nand bonding (Park 2000). Although they constructed the same model of\ndirected valence, Slater\u2019s style and motivation were quite different from\nLinus Pauling\u2019s. Buhm Soon Park argues that Slater\u2019s papers on hybri-\ndisation were an attempt to \u201clay out the procedure for solving the Schro\u00a8-\ndinger equation for molecules in general, rather than carry out compu-\ntations for actual examples\u201d (Park 2000, 461). Moreover, Slater sought\ngeneral theoretical justification for his approximations, rather than com-\nputational tractability and physical plausibility in the case at hand.\nPhilosophically, Slater followed Bridgman\u2019s pragmatism, and was con-\nsequently uninterested in, even hostile to, discussion of the interpretation\nof quantum mechanics: like other American scientists of the time, he\npreferred to get on with applying the theory (Cartwright 1987; Schweber\n1990, section 4). In some tension with this pragmatism, however, were\nthe reductionist philosophical views he also professed, and the method-\nological outlook they inspired. As early as 1933, Slater complained, \u201cThe\nstudy of molecular structure has been too much based on particular mod-\nels, rather than on general principles\u201d (quoted in Schweber 1990, 396),\nthe \u2018principles\u2019 being physical ones. Moreover, as he argued in an un-\ndelivered lecture written in 1937, physics is\n. . . the simplest science, and the one which most nearly gets us back\nto first causes. Its laws . . . its fundamental particles, seem as basic\nin the scheme of things as scientists have succeeded in getting. Next,\nnow hardly distinguishable from it, comes chemistry. (Slater, quoted\nin Schweber 1990, 391)\nSlater\u2019s views on the valence-bond and molecular-orbital approaches are\nrevealing. While the chemists argued over the relative merits of the\nvalence-bond and molecular-orbital theories, and sought to defend and\nextend their explanatory uses, in his textbook An Introduction to Chemical\nPhysics (1939), Slater presented them as two approximation methods,\ndiffering \u201cnot in their fundamentals, but in the precise nature of the\nanalytical steps used\u201d (1939, 368). A proper understanding of the forces\nbetween atoms and molecules, he thought, should appeal to \u201cfundamental\nprinciples, without reference to exact [for which read, particular] methods\nof calculation\u201d (368). Slater\u2019s ecumenism on the issue of valence-bond\nversus molecular-orbital theories looks to be a further expression of his\nreductionism. The two schemes should, in his view, be regarded not as\ncompeting explanations of molecular bonding, but as logically (though\nnot practically) dispensable aids to understanding the content of quantum\nPRAGMATICS OF EXPLANATION 1051\nmechanics with regard to the behaviour of molecules (see also Gavroglu\nand Simoes 2000, 427\u2013431).\nSlater saw himself as an upholder of standards of rigour that were\ntransgressed by others engaged in applying quantum mechanics to mol-\necules. In 1950 he complained that\n[T]he theory of chemical valence was taken up by the chemists, who\nrather naturally did not have enough fundamental insight into the\nnature of wave mechanics to make the contributions to the theory\nwhich were really needed to put it in a satisfactory form, but instead\nproceeded on the one hand to a great extension of its mathematical\nformalism, on the other to stretching the theory far beyond what was\njustified by its crude nature in making comparisons with experiment,\nwith the result that most of the results obtained by the chemists since\nthat time are suspect by the physicists. (Slater, quoted in Schweber\n1990, 389\u2013390)\nTowards the end of his life, he set out his own positive views on what\nthese standards should be:\nI was never satisfied with any theory that didn\u2019t come out of the\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics perfectly straight for-\nwardly, and I still stick to that point of view. Whereas a great many\npeople were willing to make what they would call models\u2014put in\nsomething that would look plausible, out of which you could get\nformulas that would describe the facts, but where you could not\nderive this model from fundamental theory\u2014I felt here we had a\nfundamental theory and a challenge to be able to explain everything\nwe see around us in terms of that fundamental theory. So I have\nalways discarded anything that didn\u2019t fit into that. (Slater, quoted in\nSchweber 1990, 396)\nSlater presents a consistent normative view of approximate theorizing,\nwhich I will try to flesh out in the rest of the section. The starting point\nis that quantum-mechanical explanation should be a subsumptive process,\nin which laws, facts and tendencies associated with molecular structure\nand bonding are shown to be special cases of the quantum mechanics of\nsystems of charged masses. The \u2018fundamental principles\u2019 of quantum me-\nchanics, plus the special assumptions and constants required for its ap-\nplication to systems of charged particles, are sufficient to determine a\ncanonical quantum-mechanical treatment for any atom or molecule. The\nexplanatory content of the theory with respect to particular molecules is\ndelimited precisely by this \u2018exact\u2019 treatment.\nOf course, the intractability of quantum-mechanical equations renders\nthis explanatory content inscrutable, but the ideal of subsumptive expla-\n1052 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nnation can be upheld even in idealized and approximate treatments, so\nlong as there is warranted satisfaction that whatever is explained using\nan idealized or approximate quantum-mechanical equation could also be\nexplained using the exact treatment, supposing that it were tractable. In\nshort, approximate or idealized \u2018model\u2019 treatments are legitimate in so\nfar as they are proxies for exact ones. That failure of autonomy restricts\ntheir proper uses. Firstly, a feature of the model\u2019s structure can legitimately\nbe appealed to in explanation only if it is shared by the exact treatment.\nHence the approximate or idealized model should have a clear mathe-\nmatical relationship to the exact treatment: if the empirical value of some\nmolecular quantity is compared to one calculated from a model treatment,\nwe need to know that the model calculation gives us something close to\nthe \u2018exact\u2019 value. Second, where a model treatment is based on approx-\nimations or idealizing assumptions, conclusions derived in the model apply\nonly where those assumptions hold. Lastly, features of an approximate\nmodel that will disappear when the limit of the exact equations is ap-\nproached (and so are not shared by the exact treatment) can have no\nplace in explanation (see also Hendry 1998, section 2). Slater\u2019s even-\nhandedness with respect to the valence-bond and molecular-orbital ap-\nproaches follows immediately: since the two methods converge as they\napproach the exact limit, they should be ignored where they diverge.\n3. The View from Chemistry: Coulson. Charles Coulson was the first Cam-\nbridge research student of J. E. Lennard-Jones, who was the first occupant\nof the first Chair in Theoretical Chemistry in the UK. After receiving his\nPh.D. in 1936 for a thesis covering the electronic structures of and\u0001H3\nmethane, a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College allowed Coulson time to\npursue a molecular-orbital treatment of fractional bond orders in arenes\nand conjugated polyenes, complementing a valence-bond treatment pub-\nlished by Linus Pauling and others in 1935. A subsequent senior lecture-\nship at Dundee lasted through most of the war (Coulson was a consci-\nentious objector), after which he was appointed to a fellowship at the\nPhysical Chemistry Laboratory in Oxford, and then a chair in theoretical\nphysics at King\u2019s College London, in 1947 (Altmann and Bowen 1974).\nHis prominence was secured in 1952, with his appointment as Rouse Ball\nProfessor of Mathematics at Oxford, and the first edition of his influential\ntextbook Valence.\nValence promoted the molecular orbital approach, displaying its ex-\nplanatory wares, especially within organic chemistry where valence-bond\ntheory had hitherto been regarded as more successful. Coulson was gen-\nerally even-handed in the book, however. He included chapters on the\nvalence-bond method, whereas Pauling had not done the same for mo-\nlecular-orbital theory in his textbook The Nature of the Chemical Bond.\nPRAGMATICS OF EXPLANATION 1053\nHe also incorporated comments from Pauling into the second and later\neditions (see Gavroglu and Simoes 2000, 442\u2013444). Like Slater, he included\ncomparisons of the two methods (Coulson 1961, 146\u2013161 and 274\u2013275),\nnoting that in fully sophisticated applications of the two methods, they\napproached equivalence. Unlike Slater, his ecumenism did not undermine\nthe explanatory autonomy of the two schemes. Both, he admitted, intro-\nduced gross approximations, compounded by \u201climitations in the amount\nof calculation that is worth while\u201d, and so their value lay in \u201cqualitative\nunderstanding, and not quantitative calculation\u201d (1961, 146). Despite their\nequivalence in the limit of fully sophisticated calculations, the tractability\nand usefulness of their applications, and the qualitative understanding\nthey afforded would frequently diverge. (For a more direct relationship\nbetween qualitative understanding and idealization see Weisberg 2004.)\nBut \u201cwhere both theories predict similar conclusions, there is considerable\nground for believing that these conclusions are correct\u201d (1961, 158).\nAt the beginning of his presentation of the valence-bond methods in\nchapter five of the book he remarks:\nIt is not unfair to say that . . . in practically the whole of theoretical\nchemistry, the form in which the mathematics is cast is suggested,\nalmost inevitably, by experimental results. This is not surprising when\nwe recognize how impossible is any exact solution of the wave equa-\ntion for a molecule. Our approximations to an exact solution ought\nto reflect the ideas, intuitions and conclusions of the experimental\nchemist. (Coulson 1961, 113\u2013114)\nBy \u201cexperimental results\u201d Coulson means experimentally calibrated the-\noretical constants associated with molecular structure: the turbulent his-\ntory of molecular structure in the nineteenth century surely qualifies as\n\u2018theoretical\u2019 any experimental results presented in terms that presuppose\nit. In comparing the valence-bond and molecular-orbital treatments of\nbond polarity, he argues that although the molecular orbital presentation\nis \u201cmore natural and conceptually the simpler,\u201d \u201cthe structures used in\nthe v.b. description do correspond to pictures long familiar, in classical\nform, to experimental chemistry.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthis link with the older and\nmore conventional language is of considerable value\u201d (1961, 154).\nContrast Coulson\u2019s remarks about approximations \u201creflecting the ideas,\nintuitions and conclusions of the experimental chemist\u201d with the caution\none finds in the \u201cview from physics\u201d about misinterpreting arbitrary el-\nements of a scheme of approximation. In the \u201cview from physics\u201d the\nexplanatory power of a model treatment should depend on some aspect\nof its mathematical form only where this is shared by the exact treatment.\nIn chapter 9 of Valence, Coulson compares valence-bond and molecular-\norbital treatments of conjugated polyenes and arenes. He concludes that\n1054 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nalthough they are far from quantitatively reliable, they provide \u201cgeneral\noutlines\u201d which\nenable us to understand a very large part of the field of organic\nchemistry, and to organize it and correlate its different sections: they\nprovide us with at very least a qualitative understanding of the es-\nsential processes at work. Taken as a whole, both the v.b. and m.o.\napproximations seem about equally good; and any theoretical con-\nclusion cannot be regarded as substantiated unless it is predicted by\nboth. (Coulson 1961, 275)\nSlater demands that a quantum mechanical theory of molecules \u201ccome\nout of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics perfectly straight\nforwardly.\u201d Coulson requires rather that results for molecules within either\nthe valence-bond or molecular-orbital approaches be corroborated by\ncorresponding results within the other framework. (This may seem to rule\nout the two approaches being explanatorily non-equivalent, but remember\nthat Coulson thinks that their explanatory power lay in how, in qualitative\nterms, they achieve the numerical results they do, which typically diverge\neven if the results do not.) On one measure, Coulson\u2019s requirements of\napproximate models seem weaker than Slater\u2019s, but notice that he adds\na desideratum that is independent of physics: explanatory and predictive\nefficacy in systematizing existing chemical theory.\nAt a conference on molecular quantum mechanics in Boulder, Colorado\nin 1960, Coulson commented in an after-dinner speech on the trends he\nhad discerned in the conference papers (see Coulson 1960). Computational\nquantum chemistry, he noted, was thought by some quantum chemists to\nbe \u201cso remote from the normal natural conventional concepts of chem-\nistry, such as bonds, orbitals, and overlapping hybrids, as to carry the\nwork itself out of the sphere of real quantum chemistry\u201d (1960, 172).\nForeseeable electronic computers offered \u201ceffectively exact\u201d solutions to\nthe Schro\u00a8dinger equation, but although ab initio approaches were osten-\nsibly more accurate, they faced a practical limit of about 20 electrons,\nand were difficult to interpret in terms of traditional chemical concepts.\nFor chemists working on the \u2018posterior\u2019 approaches,\n[t]he role of quantum chemistry is to understand these concepts and\nshow what are the essential features in chemical behavior. These\npeople are anxious to be told why, when one vinyl group is added\nto a conjugated chain, the uv absorption usually shifts to the red;\nthey are not concerned with calculating this shift to the nearest ang-\nstrom; all they want is that it should be possible to calculate the shift\nsufficiently accurately that they can be sure that they really do possess\nthe fundamental reason for the shift. Or, to take another example,\nPRAGMATICS OF EXPLANATION 1055\nthey want to know why the HF bond is so strong, when the FF bond\nis so weak. They are content to let spectroscopists or physical chemists\nmake the measurements; they expect from the quantum mechanician\nthat he will explain why the difference exists. But any explanation\nwhy must be given in terms which are regarded as adequate or suit-\nable. So the explanation must not be that the computer shows that\n, since this is not an explanation at all, butD(H\u0002 F) k D(F\u0002 F)\nmerely a confirmation of experiment. Any acceptable explanation\nmust be in terms of repulsions between nonbonding electrons, dis-\npersion forces between the atomic cores, hybridization and ionic char-\nacter. (Coulson 1960, 173)\nNow Coulson was a scion of Cambridge mathematics, confident of the\ncentral role of advanced mathematical tools in solving chemical problems,\nand many of his efforts certainly were directed towards developing math-\nematical methods for quantum chemistry (Altmann and Bowen 1974, 107\u2013\n110). As Simoes and Gavroglu point out, Coulson might be expected to\nhave sympathized with the ab initio calculations, but he didn\u2019t. Although\nhe acknowledged that ab initio and semi-empirical studies may be ap-\npropriate for different kinds of theoretical activity, much of his own work\nwas devoted to the recovery within molecular quantum mechanics of such\ntraditional chemical notions as bent bonds and partial valence (Simoes\nand Gavroglu 1999, 380\u2013389; see also Altmann and Bowen 1974, 97\u2013\n105). Coulson\u2019s mathematics was designed to suit \u201cchemical intuition,\u201d\nnot annihilate or revise it.\n4. The Pragmatics of Explanation. Slater and Coulson both appeal to the\nnotion of explanation to make normative claims about the application of\nquantum mechanics to chemistry, but the points they make are opposed,\nsuggesting that their views of explanation are opposed too. Slater sees\nthe chemists\u2019 semi-empirical \u2018models\u2019 as ad hoc, and rules them out as\nlegitimate applications of quantum mechanics because they fail to fit the\nparadigm of physical explanation. Coulson doesn\u2019t explicitly reject Slater-\ntype explanation, but doubts its applicability to the new discipline of\nquantum chemistry. The first problem is tractability: tough explanatory\nideals\u2014like Slater\u2019s \u201cchallenge to be able to explain everything we see\naround us in terms of . . . fundamental theory\u201d\u2014are all very well, but\nthere are trade-offs against explanatory power (measured in detailed cal-\nculation, rather than promissory notes). The second concern is consequent\non this. In his 1960 critique of the \u2018ab initio\u2019 methods, Coulson noted\nthat the numerical methods that were developed to address the tractability\nissue, and which became so powerful with the advent of digital computing,\nhave their own drawbacks. What makes the numerical approaches yield\n1056 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\naccurate results (e.g. large basis sets in calculating molecular wavefunc-\ntions) is precisely what makes them difficult to interpret in terms of the\n\u2018traditional\u2019 concepts of chemistry (for an account of why this should be\nso, see Woody 2000). This need be no defect in the view from physics,\nwhere physical explanation of chemical facts might well be revisionary:\nif chemical bonds don\u2019t arise naturally in accurate quantum mechanics,\nso much the worse for the chemical bond. Max Born, for instance, referred\nto chemical valence theory as \u2018speculation\u2019, and thought that physicists\nwould need to calculate the binding energies of molecules to \u201cestablish\nthe cases in which the valence theory of the chemist is reliable\u201d (Born,\nquoted in Nye 1993, 229). However, Coulson identifies specifically chem-\nical explanatory demands on quantum mechanics that are qualitative, and\ninvolve essential reference to the bond and derivative notions. The num-\nber-crunching ab initio studies cannot meet those demands, he argues,\nbut quantum chemistry should meet them, and semi-empirical methods\noffer the means of doing so.\nIt has been known since the earliest philosophical theories of expla-\nnation that the understanding afforded by an explanation depends on\nfeatures of the context in which it is given, even if the authors of those\ntheories sought to abstract away from such pragmatic features. Given a\ntarget audience, relevant factors include the level of background knowl-\nedge assumed, the nature, presentation and plausibility of explanatory\ninformation, the salience of particular explanatory demands, and (more\ncontroversially) the explanatory relevance relation. The term \u2018pragmatics\nof explanation\u2019 is usually understood in this narrow sense, but Slater\u2019s\nand Coulson\u2019s perceptions of their epistemic contexts differ in a wider\nsense, for they were trying to do quite different things with their quantum-\nmechanical explanations (for an argument along similar lines as what\nfollows, see Ramsey 2000).\nFor Slater, a quantum-mechanical explanation of chemical bonding is\n(to a first approximation) a subsumption of facts about the structure and\nstability of particular molecules under the quantum mechanics of systems\nof charged masses. (Whether his explicit view accurately reflects the dis-\ncipline of physics more widely, or his own explanatory projects in solid\nstate theory, is not a question to pursue here.) Revisionism with respect\nto standing theories of chemical structure and bonding is less worrying\nfor Slater than it is for Coulson. For Slater, it is more important to get\nthe fundamentals right from a physical point of view than it is to provide\nworkable models of chemically interesting molecules. Slater (and Born)\nassume a community (of physicists) already assured that quantum me-\nchanics is the fundamental theory governing molecular structure. This\ncommunity does not need convincing of the ultimate explanatory impor-\nPRAGMATICS OF EXPLANATION 1057\ntance of quantum mechanics with success cheaply achieved using ad hoc\nmodels.\nCoulson saw himself as both a contributor to and advocate for the\nexplanatory application of quantum mechanics within chemistry. The in-\ntradisciplinary standing of quantum chemistry could not but depend on\nits being seen\u2014by chemists\u2014to meet chemical explanatory demands. Or-\nganic chemists (to take an example) would have had fewer reasons than\nphysical chemists to accept claims for the explanatory power of quantum\nmechanics with respect to chemical problems. Successful quantum-\nmechanical treatments of the spin states of the silver atom, say, or the\nspectrum of hydrogen, would not by themselves show that the theory had\nanything useful to say about molecules like benzene or naphthalene. For\nthis reason, informative treatments of complex molecules were high on\nthe theoretical agenda of quantum chemistry.\nStephen Brush (1999, 51\u201358) has analyzed how the relative standing of\nthe valence-bond and molecular-orbital approaches evolved in the first\ndecades of quantum chemistry. Brush argues that in the 1930s, the valence-\nbond approach was favoured by its presentational superiority, exemplified\nfor instance in Pauling\u2019s visual representation of aromatic bonding in\nbenzene, which echoed Kekule\u00b4\u2019s oscillating structure. In the 1940s, how-\never, Coulson produced an account of bonding in benzene within the\nmolecular orbital approach. Erich Hu\u00a8ckel had produced the first such\napplication to benzene in 1931, but Coulson added a matching visual\nrepresentation of the molecule (the now-familiar \u2018double-doughnut\u2019 p-\nbonds). This, along with the molecular-orbital theory\u2019s superior appli-\ncability to larger molecules (and later its successful novel predictions in\nthe case of pericyclic reactions) demonstrated, first to theoretical chemists\nand later to organic chemists, its superiority in accounting for the structure\nand bonding of organic molecules (1999, 291). Two points emerge from\nthis, which are in tune with Coulson\u2019s agenda for quantum chemistry.\nFirstly, what one might call \u2018upward\u2019 theoretical virtues like continuity\nwith chemical theory and explanatory power were at least as important\nin the eyes of chemists as \u2018downward\u2019 virtues like rigor in determining\nthe relative standing of the valence-bond and molecular-orbital ap-\nproaches. Secondly, supporters of the two methods accepted, by the mid-\n1930s, that they were equivalent in the limit of fully sophisticated treat-\nments, but the debate continued for some time after that. Equivalence in\nthe theoretical limit did not entail that the different ways the valence-\nbond and molecular-orbital theories simplified many-electron wavefunc-\ntions would yield equivalent explanations of the stability of, say, benzene.\nPartisans of the two approaches cited chemical differences between them\nnot only because it was an argument among chemists, but also because\nthey perceived genuine explanatory differences between the two schemes.\n1058 ROBIN FINDLAY HENDRY\nWere the non-revisionary semi-empirical methods developed merely for\npragmatic reasons? Did quantum chemists like Pauling and Coulson use\nthem only to convince skeptical chemical colleagues of the value of their\nsubdiscipline, or the superiority of this or that scheme of approximation?\nThere were positive epistemic reasons for a \u2018retentionist strategy\u2019 with\nrespect to classical chemical structure. Firstly, chemical structure theory\nwas as highly confirmed a body of theory as any in existence at the time,\nand theoretical continuity with that body of theory was consequently as\nrational as with any other. Assignments of particular molecular structures,\nand the general trends that govern them, had been providing explanations\nin spectroscopy, reaction stoichiometry and dynamics since the nineteenth\ncentury. From the chemists\u2019 perspective, revisionism is empty posturing\nunless its explanatory promissory notes can be exchanged for real alter-\nnative explanations. Secondly, in two different methodological debates\n(valence-bond versus molecular orbitals; ab initio versus semi-empirical),\nCoulson emphasized the project of deepening and systematizing existing\nstructural explanations in chemistry. This suggests a \u2018consequentialist\u2019\nresponse to Slater\u2019s charge of ad hoc theorizing. Although poorly moti-\nvated as instances of Slater\u2019s program, the semi-empirical models will not\nbe ad hoc if they treat trends and similarities between molecules in unified\nand systematic ways (based on their membership of chemical kinds). The\nunity they exhibit will, however, be local to molecular quantum chemistry.\n5. Conclusion. It is sometimes argued that the successful application of\nquantum mechanics to the explanation of molecular structure and bond-\ning in the 1930s and after provides evidence for the completeness of phys-\nics, and against the once popular view that the laws of chemistry are in\nsome sense sui generis, or emergent (see McLaughlin 1992). A full response\nto that physicalist argument should address the detailed mathematical and\nexplanatory relationships between molecular quantum chemistry and the\nquantum mechanics of systems of charged particles (see Hendry 1998,\nforthcoming). In this paper I have investigated the epistemic backgrounds\nwhich influenced the explanatory interests of physicists and chemists in\nthe first decades of quantum chemistry. If quantum chemistry is a relatively\nautonomous theoretical discipline rather than an instance of a broader\nphysical theory, the epistemic processes I have described provide a meth-\nodological explanation of why that should be so.\nREFERENCES\nAltmann, S.
