The -transform domain is a new transform space for fragile water-\nmark embedding. Our watermarking method is designed by exploiting the\nsensitivity of the positions of the zeroes of the -transform around the unit\ncircle to any change made on the host image.

INTRODUCTION\nDigital image authentication is increasingly becoming more impor-\ntant with the tremendous development of the Internet. The ability of\nfragile watermarking to detect changes in the watermarked image to\nprovide authenticity and integrity of the image makes it go a long way\ntoward solving the image authentication problem.\nIn contrast to a semifragile watermark [1], [2], which only seeks to\ndetect a predefined set of illegitimate distortions to the host image, a\nfragile watermark is designed to detect any change to the host image.\nHence, a variety of fragile watermarking methods has been proposed by\nembedding identifying information in the least-significant bits (LSBs)\nof the image [3]\u2013[6]. Unfortunately, these methods are somewhat unse-\ncured as the use of LSBs could be easily detected and manipulated. In\n[7], a fragile watermarking scheme using a statistical model was pro-\nposed. However, the scheme was only able to localize distorted pixels\naltered in the five most significant bits. In our work, we propose a novel\nfragile watermarking scheme in the z-transform domain. The z-trans-\nform is a convenient yet invaluable tool for representing, analyzing,\nand designing discrete-time signals and systems [8]\u2013[10]. However, to\nour knowledge, this is the first time that this transform has been applied\nto digital watermarking. The locations of zeroes of the z-transform are\nvery susceptible to any pixel value change. It has the advantage of easy\nimplementation and pixel-wise sensitivity to external tampering. More-\nover, it provides better data-hiding security protection than the normal\nLSBs check-sum fragile watermarking techniques.\nManuscript received August 2, 2006; revised January 30, 2008.

ZEROES OF z-TRANSFORM\nTheorem: Assume that f [n], n = 0; 1; . . . ; N \u00001 is a non-negative\nreal sequence which is not uniformly zero. Then, the z-transform of\nf [n] must have negative real root(s) if f [0] 6= 0, f [N \u0000 1] 6= 0, and\nN are even.\nProof: By the definition of z-transform [10]\nF (z) =\nN\u00001\nn=0\nf [n]z\u0000n =\nA\nzN\u00001\nN\u00001\ni=1\n(z \u0000 zi): (1)\nFrom (1), it can be concluded that fzigmust either be real or occur in\nconjugate pairs to ensure that the coefficients f [n] are real. Meanwhile,\nsince f [0] 6= 0 and f [N \u0000 1] 6= 0, the z-transform series has an even\nnumber of items. Therefore, the total number of roots should be odd. It\nfollows that there is at least one real root. Consider zpr , which is a root\nof F (z) such that it is real and positive. Then, we have\nF (z)\nz=z\n=\nN\u00001\nn=0\nf [n](zpr)\nn = 0:\nSince f [n] is nonnegative, we have\nf [n] = 08 n\nwhich contradicts the hypotheses that the sequence is not uniformly\nzero.\nIn conclusion, F (z) must have real root(s), and this (these) real\nroot(s) can only be negative. Moreover, most of the negative real ze-\nroes are distributed in the neighborhood of the unit circle.\nIII. PROPOSED METHOD\nThe diagram of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1. The original\nimageX is divided into nonoverlapping blocks of size N \u0002N , where\nN is an even positive integer. By viewing it row by row, each block can\nbe expressed as a sequence of vectors fxmg, m = 0; 1; . . . ; N \u0000 1,\nwhere xm = fxm[n]g, n = 0; 1; . . . ; N \u0000 1. We then perform the\nz-transform and obtain the zeroes, which are denoted as fzm;ig, i =\n1; . . . ; N \u0000 1, and m = 0; . . . ; N \u0000 1.\nWe embed the watermark w by slightly perturbing the locations of\nthe zeroes, where w is a binary sequence of N . The watermark bits\nare randomly generated and the initial seed number is contained in a\nsecret key file. A watermark signal of N bits long is embedded into\nevery block, that is, one bit is embedded into every vector. To avoid the\ncomplex number computation, we embed the authentication watermark\nby slightly modifying the modulus of negative real zeroes, which are\ndenoted by znr . As proven in Section II, since N is even, which is\nthe case under most circumstances for natural images, there must be at\nleast one real negative zero in the zero set of a pixel vector. Besides the\nnegative real zero, there are (N=2)\u00001 pairs of complex zeroes for every\nvector (the number of complex zeroes would be less if multiple negative\nreal zeroes exist). Consider the vectorxm and denoteVm as the number\n1556-6013\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

We then compute\np = w \b h (3)\nwhere \b is the exclusive OR function. The watermarking is performed\nby embedding p into the negative real zeroes. The data-hiding process\nis defined as follows:\nz0nr =\n\u00001 + 1:5\u000f+ U(znr + 1)(0:5\u000f); if p = 1\n\u00001\u0000 1:5\u000f\u0000 U(\u0000znr \u0000 1)(0:5\u000f); if p = 0\n(4)\nwhere\nU(t) =\n1; if t \u0015 0\n0; if t < 0\nznr; z\n0\nnr 2\n\u0000 are the original and the watermarked zeros, respec-\ntively, and 0 < \u000f < 0:1. The small positive offset \u000f determines the\ntradeoff between the fragility of the watermarking scheme and the\nquality of the watermarked image.\nAfter the watermark embedding process, we transform the zeroes\nback to the sequence using the inverse z-transform. We then obtain an-\nother vector x0m, which is slightly different from the one before water-\nmarking. By applying the aforementioned process to all of the relevant\nblocks, we obtain the watermarked image Y.\nIn the authentication process, we need the watermarked image and\nthe secret key to identify the watermark. Let the watermarked image\nafter passing through variant communication channels be Y^. The wa-\ntermark sequence w is generated using the initial state number con-\ntained in the key. The authentication process also starts by dividing the\nimage into small blocks of size N \u0002 N . In every block, by applying\nthe z-transform to every row, we obtain the zeroes. We find the values\nof fVmg and compute h = H(K;V0; V1; . . . ; VN\u00001). We then obtain\np by (3).

Experimental Results\nIn our experiment, we set \u000f = 0:02. We used gray-scale image Fin-\ngerprint as shown in Fig. 2(a) to test our authentication algorithm. A\nblock size of 8\u0002 8 was used, which is commonly used in image-pro-\ncessing applications. The watermarked image is displayed in Fig. 2(b).\nWe shall see that the watermarked image looks identical to the orig-\ninal image, with a peak-to-signal noise ratio (PSNR) value of approxi-\nmately 45 dB. As shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d), a small part of the finger-\nprint image was modified. The authentication result by our algorithm\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fragility of Watermark to Pixel Perturbation\nFrom our observation, the zero locations of the z-transform are very\nsensitive to the value change of even a single pixel, which renders the\nz-transform domain ideal for fragile watermarking. We have investi-\ngated this property experimentally. We collected 1000 gray-scale nat-\nural images and calculated the negative real zeroes of the z-transform\nof their pixel sequences as described in Section III. We then randomly\nchanged one pixel value in every sequence and calculated the ampli-\ntudes of the offsets of the negative real zeroes, which are reported in\nFig. 3. It can be observed that even a single pixel\u2019s change unavoidably\ndisturbs the zero locations. In addition, we found that 98% of the neg-\native real zeroes tend to shift toward the unit circle and as illustrated in\nFig. 3, the distribution peaks at an offset of 0.18, which is enough to\nchange the watermark detection results.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we discuss a novel fragile watermarking method based\non the z-transform domain. The watermark bits are embedded by slight\nperturbation of the zero locations. The zeroes of the z-transform around\nthe unit circle are very sensitive to any change of the host image. This\nimportant property provides the scheme with special sensitivity to any\nalteration to the watermarked image and the ability of accurate local-\nizing. In addition, the proposed method is more secure than normal\nfragile watermarking techniques based on LSB embedding. Simulation\nresults confirmed the applicability of the proposed algorithm.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.-S. Lu and M. H.-Y.

If an illegal copy appears, it can be traced back to one or more guilty\npirates due to this fingerprint. A coalition of pirates may combine their\ncopies to produce an unauthorized copy with a false, hybrid fingerprint.\nIt is often assumed in the literature that the members of the collusion will\nmake equal contributions to the hybrid fingerprint, because nobody will\naccept an increased risk of being caught. We argue that no such assump-\ntion is valid a priori, and we show that a published solution by Seb\u00e9 and\nDomingo\u2013Ferrer can be broken by breaking the assumption.\nIndex Terms\u2014Collusion-attack, collusion-secure code (CSC), digital fin-\ngerprinting, scattering codes.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe problem of digital fingerprinting was introduced in [1] and has\nreceived quite some attention following [2]. A vendor of digital copies\nof copyrighted material wants to prevent unauthorized copying. Digital\nfingerprinting makes it possible to trace the guilty user (pirate) when an\nillegal copy is found. This is done by embedding a secret identification\nmark (fingerprint) in each copy, making every copy unique.\nTypically, a robust watermarking (WM) scheme is used to hide the\nfingerprint in the file. WM schemes are designed to hide any message in\na file in such a way that they can be recovered, even after being subject\nto noise, signal-processing operations, or even malicious attacks.\nIf a single pirate distributes unauthorized copies, they will carry his\nor her fingerprint. If the vendor discovers the illegal copies, he or she\ncan trace them back to the pirate and prosecute him or her. However,\na collusion of users can compare their copies, and thereby find regions\nManuscript received July 28, 2007; revised May 8, 2008.
