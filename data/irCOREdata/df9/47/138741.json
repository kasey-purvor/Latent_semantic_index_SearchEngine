Introduction\nWorldwide, around 1.8 million people are undergoing treatment for end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD) [1], of which around 1.4 million (~77%) are on dialysis treatment (89% of \nwhich are on haemodialysis and 11% on peritoneal dialysis) and the rest (23%) are living \nwith a functioning renal transplant. Haemodialysis membranes are permeable to low \nmolecular weight solutes, however, the removal of potent middle molecular weight uraemic \ntoxins by this method is quite incomplete [2].  While the identity of many of these toxins \nremains unknown, elevated blood concentrations of certain middle molecular weight \nproteins (MMW ~ 10 kDa \u2013 20 kDa) such as \uf0622-microglobulin (\uf0622M, MW 11.8 kDa) have \nbeen associated with amyloid deposition [3] and inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1\uf062, MW \n~18 kDa) have been associated with an elevated level of immune system activity [4].  \nThese are important target molecules for extracorporeal removal.  In established renal \nfailure, many other molecules in the MMW range accumulate [5].\nAn alternative to haemodialysis is to bring the blood extracorporeally in contact with a \nbiocompatible adsorbent.  There is increasing interest in the development of adsorption-\nbased systems for the non selective removal of toxins from blood for the treatment of \nuraemia [6], sepsis [7] and drug overdose [8].  A commercially available polymeric \nPage 3 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nadsorbent (Lixelle, Kaneka, Japan) designed for the removal of \uf0622M is being used in Japan \nfor the purification of haemodialysis patients\u2019 blood. The adsorbent beads are porous \ncellulose, modified with hexadecyl groups that adsorb \uf0622M by nonspecific hydrophobic \ninteractions.  Patients treated with the Lixelle column have been shown to have \nsignificantly lower levels of \uf0622M (60\u201370% reduction compared with initial levels after a 4\u20135 \nh treatment session) and concomitantly improved symptoms, including a better ability to \nundertake daily activities, reduced joint stiffness and pain, as well as a reduction of the \nappearance of bone cysts [9]. The Lixelle adsorbent capacity is reported to be around 1 \nmg \uf0622M per cm3 of adsorbent [10]. During a 4\u20135 h haemoperfusion treatment session, a \n350 cm3 column removed 210 mg of \uf0622M [10] (the typical serum concentration of \uf0622M in \nrenal patients is around 35 mg l-1).  The Lixelle column has also been shown to \nnonspecifically remove middle molecular weight plasma cytokines (IL-1\uf062, IL-6, IL-8 and \nTNF-\uf061) in humans with sepsis [11].  At the present time, this treatment is only undertaken \nin Japan and its (high) cost may exceed the value of the clinical benefits.  Other \nresearchers have investigated the use of immobilized antibody-functionalized adsorbents \nfor the selective removal of \uf0622-M [12]. Reported adsorption capacity (0.4 mg \uf0622M cm-3\nadsorbent) was comparable with the Lixelle adsorption data, but this approach is even \nmore expensive.\nThere is therefore a strong motivation to develop new, less costly polymeric adsorbents \npossessing suitable physicochemical attributes that may prove clinically beneficial.  We \nwondered whether such attributes might be achieved relatively simply by tailoring the \nmesoporous structure (4\u201310 nm range) using conventional suspension polymerization \nsynthesis techniques.  Ideally the external bead surface should have low affinity for all \nproteins;for example, by employing an ultrahydrophilic external surface coating for the \nadsorbent bead (see Figure 1); and may require surface modification to reduce adverse \nPage 4 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\ninteractions with blood that may lead to platelet activation, etc., -- proteins adsorbing on \nhydrophobic surfaces are likely to be permanently denatured [13] and recognised as \nforeign by the immune system.  The walls of the internal pores should have high affinity for \nall proteins (e.g., but could through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions). Suitable \npolymeric adsorbents must furthermore fulfil a number of clinical requirements: inter alia, \nduring haemodialysis, the amount of heparinized blood in the extracorporeal circuit (whose \nvolume is typically 250\u2013300 cm3) and the time a portion of blood spends in the \nextracorporeal circuit is necessarily limited (typical blood flow rate during haemodialysis is \n250\u2013400 cm3 min-1) to prevent blood coagulation and minimize platelet activation. In terms \nof an efficient blood purification column, these requirements translate into the following \ndesign criteria: (i) small column size, implying a high adsorption capacity per unit volume; \n(ii) fast adsorption kinetics, (implying a small bead size with a short diffusion path length); \n(iii) low pressure drop across the column, (implying a short bed length) and preferably \nmonosized beads to avoid low bed porosity.\nPhysiologically essential blood proteins such as serum albumin (HSA, MW 69 kDa) are \npresent at a very high concentration (HSA 40 g l-1 compared with \uf0622M ~ 35 mg l-1), and \nideally they should not be removed during haemoperfusion.  Moreover, if adsorption  were \nnonspecific, the high concentration (3 orders of magnitude higher than \uf0622M!) of HSA would \nflood the adsorbent surface with HSA and lead to very inefficient removal of the uraemic \ntoxins (14).  Bearing in mind that ideally the adsorbent should remove a range of middle \nmolecular weight molecules (i.e., smaller than albumin and other abundant blood proteins \nsuch as immunoglobulin and fibronectin), selectivity for the toxins in the presence of \ncompeting solutes may conveniently be achieved by size exclusion (Figure 1); the \nhydrodynamic diameter of HSA is ~7 nm and of MMW toxins such as \uf0622M ~4 nm. Note \nPage 5 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nthat size exclusion is routinely employed for the analytical determination of polymer \nmolecular weights (size exclusion chromatography, SEC).\nControl of pore structure in crosslinked polymeric resins has been investigated widely in \nthe literature [15-30], with the conclusion that controlling the maximum pore size in an \nadsorbent bead requires judicious selection of the diluents used as porogens; and the \ncrosslinking degree and to a lesser extent polymerization temperature and initiator (type \nand concentration) influence the pore structure within the polymer adsorbent bead.\nSince the adsorption process requires the toxin to diffuse within the adsorbent bead \n(where most of the surface for adsorption is present), the kinetics of the process will be \nlimited by intrabead mass transfer and hence depend on the size of the adsorbent beads. \nThere are two conflicting factors at play here, (i) whilst a small bead size will result in faster \ntoxin removal kinetics (desirable), the price to be paid will be (ii) a high external surface \narea per unit volume of packed-bed, which may result in adverse blood-surface \ninteractions and certainly a higher pressure drop across the adsorbent packed-bed.  This \nis undesirable since shear damage to blood (leading to haemolysis) is clinically dangerous.\nThe aim of the work presented here was to develop an adsorbent material that would \nsuccessfully size-exclude serum albumin while allowing middle molecular weight proteins \naccess to the internal surface of the adsorbent. We have focused on copolymers of \nstyrene divinylbenzene, PSDVB, because they are known to be good hydrophobic \nadsorbents.\n2. Experimental Materials and Methods\nPage 6 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\n2.1. Adsorbent Preparation\nDuring the suspension polymerization process, a mixture of styrene and divinylbenzene \n(oil phase) was dispersed in an aqueous solution (the continuous phase) using a novel \nmembrane emulsification process (described below). The reaction was initiated using \nbenzoyl peroxide as the initiator (1% of the monomer concentration by weight). Porogens \nstudied included toluene and mixtures of toluene with precipitating media such as \nundecane and naphthalene.  The exact compositions of the monomer phase can be seen \nin Table 1.  The monomer to porogen ratio was kept at 1:1 by weight.  The nomenclature \nused to label the adsorbents is explained by the following example: PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 \n(from Table 1) was prepared by mixing equal amounts (w\/w) of a mixture containing \nstyrene and DVB (ratio 3:5) with a porogen mixture of toluene and naphthalene (ratio 5:2).\nThe emulsion droplets were stirred throughout the reaction period and stabilized using \npoly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to keep the droplets from coalescing during the \u201csticky\u201d phase. \nOnce the polymerization reaction was complete, the polymer beads were separated from \nthe continuous phase by filtration.\n2.2. Membrane emulsification\nA conventional stirred tank system for generating an O\/W (oil in water) emulsion results in \na heterogeneous population of droplet sizes due to the nonuniformity of the shear field.  \nHence a membrane emulsification process was investigated (Figure 2).  By using a \ncontrolled pore size membrane (supplied by Micropore Technologies (UK) Ltd) a much \nnarrower size distribution than via the conventional method can be produced.  For the \nproduction of beads with a mean size of 40 \u00b5m, a circular 10 \u00b5m pore membrane was \nused. The monomer mixture was injected through the membrane into the aqueous solution \nusing a syringe pump at an injection rate of 0.4 cm3 min-1. The droplets were sheared off \nPage 7 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nthe membrane surface using a paddle stirrer.  The continuous phase used to stabilize the \noil droplets was a solution of 3% w\/w PVA (Mowiol\u2122 40-88) and 3.3% w\/w NaCl. The \ndroplet size was controlled by shear at the membrane surface (influenced by the viscosity \nof the continuous phase and by the stirrer speed) and membrane pore size.\nThe droplets formed in the dispersion cell were then transferred to a reaction vessel \ncontaining an aqueous solution of 4.5% PVA and 3.3% NaCl. The polymerization reaction \nwas carried out at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. Adsorbent beads were subsequently separated using a \nBuchner funnel and Whatman GF\/B glass fibre filters, washed with hot distilled water to \nremove the PVA and NaCl and rinsed with acetone to remove any residual water, and \nsoxhlet extracted for 8 h with toluene to remove any unreacted monomers. Finally, the \nadsorbent beads were dried under vacuum at ambient temperature overnight. Bead sizes \nwere evaluated using a Coulter LS130 instrument. The amount of material produced per \nbatch was typically ~50 cm3 of beads compared with ~100 cm3 from a conventional stirred \ntank system.\n2.3. Inverse Size Exclusion Chromatography\nSize exclusion chromatography [31-33] is conventionally used to size-separate solutes, e.g. \nproteins [34, 35] that . It is routinely used for the determination of the molecular weight \ndistribution of polymer samples [36]. Inverse size exclusion chromatography (ISEC) may \nbe used to investigate the pore structure of a swollen polymer adsorbent [37-41]. The \ntechnique employs a number of probe molecules (normally polymers of narrow molecular \nweight distribution) that do not interact with the surface of the adsorbent material. The \nretention time of each probe within a packed column of the adsorbent material reflects the \ndegree to which the probe is prevented from accessing the pore volume of the adsorbent \nPage 8 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nbeads (and consequently the adsorbent bed). This can be expressed as the exclusion \ncoefficient, Kd, which is defined as:\nKd = \nVR - V0\nVT - V0\n(1)\nwhere VR is the solute elution volume, V0 is the interparticle void volume and VT is the total \nmobile phase volume. A probe molecule too large to enter the adsorbent beads allows the \ncharacterization of the interparticle void volume (V0), and by using a molecule small \nenough to enter all the pores, total accessible mobile phase volume (VT) is quantified. \nThus for each calibration probe of intermediate size, the corresponding Kd may be \ndetermined. The retention volumes and retention times are related by the flow rate of the \nmobile phase, i.e.\nKd = \ntR - t0\ntT - t0\n(2)\nwhere tR is the solute retention time, t0 is the retention time of the excluded probe and tT is \nthe retention time of the probe that can access the whole pore volume. Thus, values for Kd\nrange from 0 (completely excluded probe) to 1 (probe that can access the whole pore \nstructure), and 1 \u2013 Kd  gives the fraction of the pore volume inaccessible to a particular \nprobe molecule.\nFor analysis of the PSDVB the mobile phase was tetrahydrofuran (THF), and the probe \nmolecules were various low polydispersity calibration polystyrenes and toluene (the \nsmallest). Table 2 shows the relationship between polymer probe molecular weight and \nthe solute viscosity radius R\u03b7 (in cm) is given by the relation:\nPage 9 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\n\uf05b \uf05d 3\n1\nA\n\u03b7 N10\nM\u03b73\nR \uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\uf03d \uf070 (3)\nwhere NA is Avogadro\u2019s number, M is the solute molecular weight and [\uf068] is the intrinsic \nviscosity (cm3 g-1) [37]. R\u03b7 accounts for both the solute mass and shape (which are also \nreflected in the intrinsic viscosity) and thus is used as a universal calibration parameter for \nSEC.\nAdsorbents with modal bead sizes of 30\u201340 \u00b5m were swollen in THF for 24 h before being \nslurry-packed under pressure (250 bar) into stainless steel columns 4.6 mm in diameter \nand 25 cm long. After packing, THF was passed through the columns overnight at a flow \nrate of 0.1 cm3 min-1 to ensure the bed was settled and any impurities removed. The \nconditions for the analysis were: column temperature 35 \uf0b0C, THF flow rate 0.5 cm3 min-1\n(Kontron Instruments HPLC pump 420), and 100 \u00b5l of 1.5 g l-1 polystyrene standard \nsolution were injected.  Detection of the standards was with a Perkin Elmer u.v.\/vis. \nLambda 2 spectrometer fitted with a flow cell operating at a wavelength of 254 nm.  \nRetention times for each standard were compiled and values for Kd calculated according to \neqn (2).\n2.4. Porosity\/Pore Size Distributions\nThe pore size distributions of the various adsorbents produced were analysed in the dry \nstate using nitrogen adsorption (77 K) on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. \nAdditionally, data for Amberlite XAD4 (Rohm & Haas), a commercially available and widely \nstudied styrene co-divinylbenzene mesoporous adsorbent, is also reported as an example \nof a widely used adsorbent. All of the adsorbents were dried overnight from toluene under \nPage 10 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nvacuum at ambient temperature. The nitrogen isotherm was fitted with the BET model to \nevaluate the surface area, and total pore volume was also recorded.  Incremental and \ncumulative pore size distributions were evaluated from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm \ndata using mean-field density functional theory (DFT) [42].\n2.5. Albumin and lysozyme uptake\nThe prohibitively high cost of \uf0622-M for the physicochemical characterization experiments \nled us to seek a low-cost protein of similar size to \uf0622-M, and readily available in a pure \nstate. Lysozyme (hen egg white, MW 14.4 kDa, size ~ 4 nm) was used as a surrogate for \n\uf0622-M (MW 11.8 kDa, size ~ 4 nm). The purpose of the single solute in vitro adsorption \nstudies was to demonstrate the accessibility of the adsorbent internal surface to solutes of \nsize ~ 4 nm and concomitant rejection of the significantly larger HSA (and a fortiori the \neven larger immunoglobulins).\nCharacterising adsorbents in terms of adsorption capacity and adsorption kinetics is \npossible experimentally using a batch stirred tank reactor.  The time to equilibrate\/saturate \nthe adsorbent with protein diffusing from the bulk solution to the interior of the adsorbent \nparticle depends on the particle size of the adsorbent beads and the effective diffusivity of \nthe protein in the interior of the adsorbent.  A small number of experiments under carefully \ncontrolled conditions was undertaken.\nThe dynamic batch adsorption experiments were conducted in a thermostated (37 \uf0b0C) 0.5 l \nstirred tank reactor fitted with an overhead agitator and baffles. Influence of stirrer agitation \nrate on the kinetics of the adsorption process was investigated and the stirrer agitation \nspeed was selected such that external mixing effects no longer influenced the kinetics of \nthe adsorption process (Biot number Bi  = kfRp\/De > 100, where kf is the external film mass \nPage 11 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\ntransfer coefficient, Rp the bead radius and De the solute effective diffusivity in the \nadsorbent pores). 0.5 l of pH-buffered (containing HEPES at a concentration of 10 mM, \nNaCl 100 mM, pH 7.2) protein solution (containing either lysozyme at an initial \nconcentration of 100 mg l-1 or human serum albumin at an initial concentration of 200 mg l-\n1) was brought into contact with a known amount of preswollen adsorbent, XAD4 or \nPSDVB3:5TolNap5:2. Solution samples were taken at regular intervals until no change in \nsolution protein concentration was recorded. The solution protein concentration was\nmeasured using reverse phase HPLC (Agilent 1100 series) equipped with a diode array \ndetector (detection wavelength \uf06c = 230 and 290 nm for albumin and lysozyme, \nrespectively) and a C18 analytical column (Supelco, UK). The mobile phases were A: \nultrapure water with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and B: acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA.  A \nlinear gradient was used starting at (98% A : 2% B) and ending at (20% A: 80% B) over 60 \nminutes followed by a step change back to (98% A : 2% B) for 10 minutes to equilibrate \nthe column for the next sample. The combined mobile phase flow rate was set at 1 cm3\nmin-1, the column temperature was set at 40 \uf0b0C and the sample injection volume used was \n100 \uf06dl. The reported adsorption capacity values (q*, mg g-1) correspond to saturation \nprotein uptake values whereas the fractional uptake F(t) = q(t)\/q* represents the \nnormalised uptake at a given time point (t).\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Bead Size Control\nFigure 3 shows representative bead size distributions for two of the materials generated \nusing the membrane emulsification technique.  The data illustrate the effect of shear at the \nmembrane surface on the droplet size distribution. Median diameters within the range of \n30 to 300 \uf06dm could be controllably produced. Table 3 summarizes the bead size \nPage 12 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\ninformation for the three adsorbents studied using the inverse size exclusion \nchromatography (ISEC) technique.\nAdsorbents used in fixed-bed haemoperfusion systems tend to have bead sizes larger \nthan 300 \uf06dm. The ISEC work required the bead size to be an order of magnitude smaller \n(to aid resolution of the different probe retention peaks). Thus, the effect of the smaller \nbead size on the resulting pore size distribution was evaluated. Nitrogen \nadsorption\/desorption data was obtained for two PSDVB3:5TolUn1:0 samples with median \nbead sizes of 37 and 120 \u00b5m respectively. It is evident from Figure 4 that the pore \nstructure is essentially invariant for polymerization within oil droplets of different sizes over \nthis range. Thus, we can infer that ISEC measurements on material of smaller average \nsize may be used to provide insight into the pore structure of larger beads prepared under \nsimilar suspension polymerization conditions.\n3.2. Control of pore structure\nThe three monomer and porogen combinations investigated in the present study focus on \nthe use of toluene, a good solvent for polystyrene, to generate small pores, thereby \nreducing the maximum pore size. Figure 5 shows the normalized incremental pore volume \ndistributions for the materials studied. Table 4 provides a summary of the BET surface \narea, total pore volume and discretized surface area and pore volumes for pores in the \nranges 2\u201310 nm and 10\u201350 nm.\nComparing the pore structure of the adsorbent sample prepared using undecane \n(PSDVB1:1TolUn9:1) with XAD4 shows that while having different overall surface areas \nand pore volumes (Table 4), the two samples have similar pore size distributions (Figure \n5), especially in the region above 10 nm.  PSDVB3:5TolUn1:0 and PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 \nPage 13 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nboth have similar cut-offs at ~20 nm; however, PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 has a smaller fraction \nof its pores in the region above 10 nm, which was the desired synthesis objective for \npromoting serum albumin exclusion.\nAnalysis of the adsorbent materials in the swollen state was done using ISEC themain \ndrawback of which is the requirement that the mobile phase be THF (to minimize \nnonspecific interactions between polystyrene probes and the adsorbent), a good solvent \nfor polystyrene. This may result in polymer segment swelling with the undesirable effect of \nchanging the internal pore structure compared with that of the polymer when suspended in \nwater or in contact with blood. There is however evidence that low-temperature vacuum \ndrying of a crosslinked polymeric adsorbent (medium to high crosslinking density) from a \nsolvent (either a poor or a good one) followed by nitrogen porosimetry may allow the \nporous structure in that solvent to be retained and hence recorded [21]. Thus, if the \nmaximum pore size (pore cut-off) of the methanol-dried adsorbent (methanol is a poor \nsolvent for polystyrene) is the same as that for a toluene-dried sample, then it is \nreasonable to assume that the results from the ISEC technique may be used to predict the \nmolecular weight cut-off for the adsorbent samples in THF. The adsorbents prepared in \nthis study have a high crosslinking degree and would be expected to have a stable pore \nstructure in any case. Figure 6 shows the cumulative pore volume distributions of \nPSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 when dried from toluene, acetone and methanol respectively. Figure \n6 clearly shows that there are differences in the pore volumes for this material when \nswollen in different solvents.  The normalized data would highlight any differences in the \ndistribution of pores due to swelling in different solvents.  As the normalized distributions \noverlay on one another, this suggests that while the total pore volume changes, the \ndistribution of the pores (greater than ~1 nm) and the pore cut-off remains unchanged. \nHence we may use ISEC with confidence.\nPage 14 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\n3.3. ISEC\nEight polystyrene standards in THF were used to probe the three adsorbents under \ninvestigation. XAD4 was not evaluated using ISEC as commercial material is not available \nin the appropriate bead size range (less than 50\uf06dm); PSDVB1:1TolUn9:1 with its \ncomparative pore structure was used as a surrogate for XAD4. 8 probe standards and \ntoluene (see Table 2) were individually injected into the column packed with the adsorbent \nmaterial and a composite chromatogram overlaying all the peaks for each sample was \ngenerated (see Figure 7). From these chromatograms, the exclusion coefficients Kd were \ncalculated (eqns (1) and (2)). Kd represents the fraction of the pore volume which the \nprobe is able to access and this has been plotted in Figure 8 for the PSDVB1:1TolUn9:1 \nand PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 polymer samples.\nSerum albumin has a nominal size of ~7 nm (hydrodynamic radius ~ 3.5 nm). Reference to \ndata in Table 2 shows that this falls between polystyrene probe standards PS 10 kDa, R\u03b7\n2.8 nm and PS 20 kDa, R\u03b7 4.7 nm. The chromatogram for PSDVB1:1TolUn9:1 (Figure 7A) \nclearly shows that the 20 kDa polystyrene probe (peak 7) is able to enter some part of the \nadsorbent pore structure. The chromatogram for PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 shows the peak for \nthe 20 kDa polystyrene standard bunched up with the peak for the 1 MDa polystyrene \nstandard, implying rejection of the probe from the adsorbent. Resolution of probes below \n10 kDa is possible with the adsorbent material packed in this column. Figure 8 shows the \nfraction of the pore volume accessible to albumin-sized probes. Thus, on the basis of the \nISEC data, the adsorbent material PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 possesses a well defined \nmesopore structure (< 10 nm) capable of size-excluding serum albumin whilst allowing \nmiddle molecular weight solutes access to the internal surface of the adsorbent.\nPage 15 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\n3.4. Albumin and lysozyme uptake\nAnalysis of protein equilibrium uptake data\nThe protein adsorption data obtained for XAD4 and PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 are presented in \nTable 5. The saturation capacity values (q*) for lysozyme (LYZ) were 59 mg g-1 for \nPSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 and 330 mg g-1 for XAD4. The saturation capacity values (q*) for \nhuman serum albumin (HSA) were 2.2 mg g-1 for PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 and 95 mg g-1 for \nXAD4. The adsorption capacity values were found to be concentration-independent \n(irreversible adsorption). This is fairly common for single protein adsorption studies, where \nsurface coverage has been found in many cases to equate to quasi-monolayer adsorption \n[43, 44]. The protein saturation capacity values were found to correlate with the surface \narea accessible to lysozyme (22 m2 g-1) and albumin (0.9 m2 g-1) for PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 \n(nitrogen porosimetry data) determined on the basis of size exclusion from pores smaller \nthan 6 nm for lysozyme and 14 nm from albumin. This corresponds to surface coverage \uf047\nof 2.7 mg m-2 for lysozyme and 2.4 mg m-2 for albumin. Analysis of protein saturation data \nfor XAD4 using a similar basis as for PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 yields the surface areas \naccessible to lysozyme (120 m2 g-1) and albumin (40 m2 g-1). This corresponds to \uf047 = 2.8 \nmg m-2 for lysozyme and 2.4 mg m-2 for albumin. These values are comparable to jammed, \nrandomly adsorbed monolayer coverages reported previously [45, 46].\nBatch adsorption dynamics\nIn addition to evaluation of the protein saturation uptake, time series data were modelled \nusing the irreversible adsorption model proposed by Suzuki and Kawazoe [47] to extract \nsolute intraparticle diffusivities (De). The adsorbent samples used were sieved to obtain\ntight particle size fractions. Experiments were performed using a single dissolved protein in \n0.1M Hepes buffer solution.  A summary of the values of the experimental variables used \nfor the batch adsorption experiments are provided in Table 6.  The stirrer speed was set to \nPage 16 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\n726 rpm as this was found to minimise external film mass transfer resistance to solute \ndiffusion permitting evaluation of the intraparticle diffusional resistance to mass transfer.\nThe 1st order differential equation derived by Suzuki et. al. [47] relating the change in \nsolute concentration in the tank to uptake by the adsorbent was solved using Matlab \nsoftware (version 7). The best fit value of the effective solute diffusivity De was found by \nminimising the sum of the squares of the errors (difference between the model prediction \nand the experimental data). The best fit intraparticle diffusivity values De evaluated for LYZ \nand HSA adsorption by PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 and XAD 4 are presented in Table 6. \nExperimental kinetic data plotted as fractional uptake F(t) curves are presented in Figure 9; \nthe model predictions are shown as solid curves.\nThe fitted intraparticle diffusivity values De obtained for the lysozyme adsorption data \nsuggested that the uptake kinetics for PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 (De = 4 x 10\n-13 m2 s-1) are in \norder of magnitude slower in comparison with XAD4 (De = 4 x 10\n-12 m2 s-1). The data in \nFigure 9 shows slower lysozyme uptak  by XAD4 due to the larger particles size for XAD4 \n(dp = 576 \uf06dm) compared with PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 (dp = 28 \uf06dm).  The slower adsorption \nkinetics may be attributed to the tighter mesopore structure within PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2, \nmanifested in a reduction in the magnitude of the effective diffusivity of the solute within \nthe adsorbent particle.\nHSA (De = 5 x 10\n-11 m2 s-1) adsorption kinetics for XAD4 was found to be faster in \ncomparison with lysozyme (De = 4 x 10\n-12 m2 s-1) removal. HSA is able to access only a \nfraction of the adsorbent pore structure, which appears to provide little hindrance to the \ndiffusion of the solute.  The effective diffusivity is similar in magnitude to the free solution \ndiffusivity for HSA (6.1 x 10-11 m2 s-1). PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2 adsorption capacity for HSA \nPage 17 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\nwas small suggesting predominantly adsorption on the external bead surface. The fitted \nintraparticle diffusivity was similar in magnitude to the free solution diffusivity for HSA (6.1 \nx 10-11 m2 s-1).\n4. Conclusions\nControlling the internal pore structure of poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) adsorbents (pore \nsize less than 10 nm) is a route to enabling the removal of middle molecular weight \nproteins whilst excluding larger molecules like serum albumin. A styrene-containing \nadsorbent (PSDVB3:5TolNap5:2) has been engineered using a membrane emulsification \ntechnique and it has been demonstrated that microspheres with median bead diameters in \nthe range of 30 to 300 \uf06dm can be prepared by the process. The microspheres have been \nshown to size-exclude serum albumin whilst allowing removal of smaller proteins \n(lysozyme, a surrogate for middle molecular weight uraemic toxins). The use of ISEC to \nprobe the pore structure of synthesized adsorbents has proved useful in demonstrating the \ninfluence of pore structure control on the size rejection behaviour. The adsorption data \nprovides evidence of the albumin size exclusion phenomena and is currently being \ninvestigated in more detail. Preliminary dynamic adsorption studies suggest hindered \ntransport of middle molecules due to the narrow pore size distribution needed to size-\nexclude human serum albumin.\nThe kidney is of course an amazingly complex organ [48], and a size-selective adsorbent \ncan of course only provide a very partial replacement of its function, but in the case of \nrenal failure the clinical options are limited, and an improvement in the current poor \nremoval of uraemic toxins by haemodialysis would be of great value for public health.  The \nwork reported here is a step in this direction.\nPage 18 of 36\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Engineering and Physical \nSciences Research Council (grant nos.
