The resistance as a function of temperature (T) has been\nmeasured from 20 to 200 \u00b0C and the data have been fitted to a variable range hopping model in\nwhich the resistivity is described as r5r0T exp(T0 \/T)0.5 where T0 was found to be 2.243105 K.\nScanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements were carried out over the temperature range of\n20\u2013 300 \u00b0C, to study the shape of the local density of states ~LDOS!. Such measurements have not\nbeen carried out on this class of spinel structured materials before.

The\nevolution of a peak around 1.8 eV was observed with increasing temperature and found to be\ncompletely reversible with temperature. \u00a9 2002 American Institute of Physics.\n@DOI: 10.1063\/1.1505690#\nNickel manganese oxide (NixMn32xO41d (0.4<x<1))\nconstitutes a family of cubic spinel structured materials1\nwhich exhibit negative temperature coefficient ~NTC! of re-\nsistance characteristics. The dependence of electrical resis-\ntance on temperature has made this material useful as tem-\nperature sensors mainly as thermistors but more recently\nthese have been used for making infrared detecting bolom-\neters. The electrical conduction process is believed to be due\nto localized electron hopping from Mn31 to Mn41 in the\noctahedral sites in the lattice.2 Different transport models\nsuch as nearest-neighbor hopping,1 variable range hopping,3\nand some empirical models4,5 have been suggested to explain\nthe conduction of such materials. In developing these models\nassumptions are made about the possible shape of the distri-\nbution of the local density of states ~LDOS! around the\nFermi level.6 Although much effort has been devoted into\nstudying the structural, electrical transport, and optical\nproperties7 of such materials, the electronic structure has re-\nmained unresearched. In this work electron tunneling mea-\nsurements have been carried out using scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy ~STS!, in order to elucidate the electronic struc-\nture of the material.\nThin films of NixMn32xO41d were produced using rf\nmagnetron sputtering from a ceramic target, prepared by\nmixing stoichiometric ratios of NiO and Mn2O3 , which were\npressed into 36 mm diameter disks and subsequently sintered\nat 1200 \u00b0C for 24 h. The target was then cooled to 800 \u00b0C\nand annealed for 40 h before quenching to room\ntemperature8 to give a well densified monophasic ;3 mm\ndisk.\nThe films were deposited in a mixed argon\/oxygen\n~12.5% oxygen! ambient on ~100! oriented silicon substrates.\nThe films were annealed at 800 \u00b0C for 1 h to attain a fully\ncrystallized monophase cubic spinel material, as confirmed\nusing x-ray diffraction ~XRD!. The microstructures of both\nthe as-deposited and annealed films were examined using\nscanning tunneling microscopy ~STM! which showed dense\npolycrystalline layers with a well defined grain structure in\nthe annealed state as demonstrated in Fig. 1.\nThe resistance versus temperature ~RT! measurements\nwere undertaken in air from room temperature up to 200 \u00b0C\nin a custom built furnace using a Microcal temperature con-\ntroller. The resistance was measured using a Kiethley 617\nelectrometer. STS measurements were carried out in ultra-\nhigh vacuum using an Omicron VT-AFM\/STM equipped\nwith an in situ sample heater. Tips used for all the measure-\nments were prepared by mechanically sectioning a platinum\/\niridium wire. The spectroscopy was done at room tempera-\nture, 100, 150, 175, 200, and 300 \u00b0C. The measurements\nwere carried out on every pixel over an area 6003600 nm2\narea, which was divided into 2563256 pixels. The experi-\nmental parameters chosen for the STS measurements were 1\nV bias and 0.2 nA tunneling current. In current imaging tun-\nneling spectroscopy ~CITS! mode, the I\/V curves were re-\ncorded simultaneously with a constant current image by the\ninterrupted-feedback-loop technique.

The divergence problem in this case\nwas overcome by applying some broadening (DV) to the I\/V\nvalues.10 In all cases DV was taken as 1 V. The positions of\nthe spectral features were insensitive to the values chosen for\nDV when the normalization of dI\/dV was carried out,\nalthough the half width of the peak was reduced at\nsmaller DV .\nSTS measurements have been done over the energy\nrange of 63 eV. The results clearly indicate that the shape of\nthe LDOS was parabolic around the Fermi level. With in-\ncreasing temperature, starting from about 150 \u00b0C, a peak\nevolved in the spectra at around 11.8 eV ~unoccupied states!\nindicated in Fig. 2 as SS2 . The appearance of the peak was\ncompletely reversible and it disappeared when the tempera-\nture was lowered. There were some other features in the\noccupied part of the spectra as well at higher temperatures\nalthough they were not well differentiated. Experiments have\nbeen undertaken to rule out any possibility of change in the\nelectronic structure due to oxygen diffusing out at elevated\ntemperature in high vacuum inside the microscope. Two\nfilms were subjected to the same heating cycle, as used in the\nSTS studies, one in an oxygen rich atmosphere and the sec-\nond in air. Spectroscopy was then carried out on both sets of\nsamples but the results were similar to the original ones. A\nfurther small feature can also be seen in the spectra very near\nto the Fermi level indicated as SS1 in Fig. 2, but is not well\nresolved in the wide energy range over which the spectros-\ncopy was carried out.\nThe resistivity of the film was found to be 327 V cm at\n50 \u00b0C. The RT data could be fitted to the variable range\nhopping model proposed by Mott11 which assumes that the\nLDOS around the Fermi level is constant with energy and the\nresistivity is described by\nr5r0T0.5 exp~T0 \/T !0.25, ~1!\nwhere T05b\/kbg(m)a03, where b521.261.2 is a numerical\nfactor which is determined by solving the appropriate perco-\nlation problem,12 kb is the Boltzmann constant, g(m) is the\ndensity of states, and a0 is the Bohr radius. A plot of\nln(RT20.5) vs T20.25 is shown in Fig. 3 and implies an excel-\nlent fit to Eq. ~1!. However the slope gives an unfeasibly\nlarge value of T0533109 K, implying a very low density of\nstates at the Fermi level, g(m)55.531020 cm23 eV21, tak-\ning a0 to be the Bohr radius of the hydrogen atom.\nThe data could also be fitted to the modified model of\nvariable range hopping proposed by Shklovskii and Efros6\nbased on the assumption of a parabolic LDOS around the\nFermi level. The resistivity in this model is given by\nr5r0T exp~T0 \/T !0.5, ~2!\nFIG. 1. STM image of a typical annealed film (120031200 nm).\nFIG. 2.

Here, k5\u00ab0\u00abr4p , where \u00ab0\nis the permittivity of free space, \u00abr is the relative permittivity\nof the material. The product a0* \u00abr gives the effective radius\nof an atom of the material. A plot of ln(RT21) vs T20.5 is\nshown in Fig. 4 and as for the Mott model the data appear to\nbe very consistent with Eq. ~2!, although in this case the\nslope yields a more reasonable value of T052.33105 K.\nThe corresponding value for the effective radius of 2.1\n310210 m is quite realistic, suggesting that this model is\nmore consistent with the data.\nIt is evident from Figs. 3 and 4 that the conduction\nmechanisms in this material cannot be elucidated from RT\nmeasurements alone @i.e., both Eqs. ~1! and ~2! provide sta-\ntistically good fits to the data#. However, the STS measure-\nments, which show that the distribution of the LDOS around\nthe Fermi level to be parabolic, do not support the Mott\nmodel @Eq. ~1!# for transport in nickel manganate. Other fea-\ntures observed in the spectra are at quite high energy and are\nprobably not the states, which take part in the conduction in\nthis material. Presently, work is being carried out to study the\nLDOS in the low energy region (60.5 eV). This would be\nan opportunity to study the electronic states close to the\nFermi level, which are thought to be responsible for the con-\nduction process.\nIn conclusion the distribution of the LDOS in thin sput-\ntered films of cubic spinel NixMn32xO41d was found to be\nparabolic with energy. STS measurements were undertaken\nin a spinel structured material. It is also emphasized that the\nspectra were recorded in the temperature range where this\nmaterial is most commonly used. The STS observations are\nconsistent with the modified variable range hopping model\nfor conductivity developed by Shklovskii and Efros. They\nwould appear to exclude Mott variable range hopping in this\nmaterial.\nA.
