One of the major \nproblems of the coal industry is the disposal of large amounts of coal combustion residues. \nRECOAL was an EU-supported project (2005-2007) whose objective was to develop \nremediation solutions for coal ash disposal (CAD) sites in BiH. Most of RECOAL\u201fs \nenvironmental fieldwork was based around TEP in the municipality of Tuzla, one of the \nbiggest \u2013thermo-electric power plants in the country. Qualitative research was carried out to \nunderstand the environmental governance structure of the area and inform and test the \nacceptance of different remediation solutions proposed by RECOAL. Interviews with \ninstitutional stakeholders showed a highly complex institutional structure, where government \ninstitutions and industry are involved in complicated negotiations about the distribution of the \nliabilities resulting from TEP\u201fs pollution. Interviews among local residents show that locally \norganised action could help steer the policy-making process towards more sustainable \nsolutions.  \nKeywords: coal ash pollution, Central and Eastern European Countries, environmental \ngovernance, institutional change \nIntroduction \nThe energy sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina (henceforth BiH) is regarded as the main \nengine for the economic development of the country. Electricity production not only meets \ndomestic demands, but is also exported to neighbouring countries (Leki\u0107 2008). However, \ndifficulties such as inefficiencies in the energy generation and consumption technologies, and \nlosses in transmission and distribution together with the negative environmental impacts of \nthis coal-dependent industry cast a shadow on improving the country\u201fs sustainability and \ndevelopment.  \nEnergy production is managed by three vertically integrated monopolies (Elektroprivreda of \nBosnia and Herzegovina, Elektroprivreda of the Croatian Community Herzeg-Bosnia and \nElektroprivreda of the Republika Srpska.), though new private actors are emerging in this \nsector following the EU guidelines for the liberalisation of the energy sector\n1\n. According to \nElektroprivreda of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in 2006 76% of its energy production (4,812 \nGwh) was produced in coal fired thermal power plants\n2\n. Given the important reserves of coal \nnear Tuzla, and an estimated 4 billion tonnes in the whole country, the use of coal in power \ngeneration is likely to continue for quite some time (Ibreljic and Kulenovic 2005). The major \nissue regarding the production of energy from coal is the harmful environmental impact \nassociated with this industry, including the impacts of coal mining, the emission of pollutants \nto the atmosphere during combustion, and the disposal of coal combustion residues, such as \nfly ash, bottom ash and boiler slag.  \n                                                          \n1\n 2006\/55\/EC: Council Decision of 30 January 2006 on the principles, priorities and conditions \ncontained in the European Partnership with Bosnia and Herzegovina and repealing Decision \n2004\/515\/EC, OJ L 35, 7.2.2006, p. 19\u201331. \n2\n Elektropriveda data on the company\u201fs website: http:\/\/www.elektroprivreda.ba\/np\/ep\/epp?bp=7, last \naccessed 28\nth\n January 2008.  \n 3 \nTermoelektrana Tuzla (TEP) is a coal-fired energy plant producing 58% of total thermal \nelectricity produced in the Federation of BiH. However, TEP is struggling to produce energy \nat a competitive price while simultaneously reducing its environmental impacts. The disposal \nof coal combustion residues has generated discontent among local residents and \nenvironmental organisations (e.g. Brki\u0107 and Bar\u010di\u0107 undated). Since its conception in 1964 \nTEP has disposed of nearly 40 million m\n3\n of combustion residues in nearby valleys occupying \na surface of 176 hectares. These sites - locally referred to as \u201eblack deserts\u201f- have had \nnegative impacts on the quality of surrounding land and water bodies. Moreover, air pollution \noccurs when fine ash particles that deposit on the surface of the sites become airborne; dust \nclouds can travel several kilometres and spread the ash to other areas. About 4000 people \nliving close to the disposal sites are potentially exposed to the pollution. To stop dust \ndispersal, in the early 1990s TEP covered two inactive sites, Dre\u017enik and Plane (total 63 ha), \nwith a soil layer of 10-30 cm thickness. These sites are currently used by local people and \nhave been cultivated since the Bosnian war (1992-1995). \nRECOAL (Reintegration of coal ash disposal sites and mitigation of pollution in the West \nBalkan area) was a 3-year project under EU Sixth Framework Programme that finished at the \nend of 2007. Its mandate was to develop sustainable and low-cost solutions to remediate the \ncoal ash disposal (CAD) sites. RECOAL used the CAD sites in Tuzla as a case study, \ndeveloping a risk assessment of the area and evaluating several management possibilities such \nas compost additions to the ash, cultivation of indigenous crop varieties, tree belts, water \nfilters and stabilisation wetlands.  \nThe implementation of solutions developed during the project is outside the remit (and \nresources) of RECOAL. A concern of the project was, however, to facilitate the adoption of \nappropriate remediation solutions by tailoring their design to the socio-political context of \ncoal ash management in Tuzla. Hence, efforts were directed at understanding the \nenvironmental governance structure in Tuzla and exploring the perceptions of local residents \nmost likely to be affected by the implementation of the remediation solutions. This article \nrecapitulates the results of the research reviewing the challenges related to coal ash \nmanagement in Tuzla, and the potential policy obstacles for the remediation of the CAD sites. \nThe research illustrates the difficulties of the environmental governance institutions to bring \nabout effective remediation actions and suggests that locally organised action could help steer \nthe policy-making process towards more sustainable solutions. \nMethodology \nThe research targeted two different aspects of coal ash management in Tuzla. First, to unveil \nthe institutional structure, unstructured interviews were carried out among representatives of \nlocal and regional government and other local institutions, NGOs, industry, the health \nprofession and academics involved or interested in coal ash remediation. The sample \npopulation was built using existing contacts of Bosnian project partners and contractors. In \nMarch and June 2005, 17 exploratory interviews about environmental governance in Tuzla \nwere carried out, followed by 12 additional interviews in March 2006 investigating the \npotential use of the CAD sites. Finally, in December 2006, four tailored follow-up interviews \nwith selected informants took place to update the original findings.  \nSecond, semi-structured interviews were carried out among local residents in spring 2006 to \nrecord local perspectives on the CAD sites. The sample was selected by approaching \nhouseholds in the surroundings of the five disposal sites. The sample included 51 \ninterviewees, with ages ranging from early 20s to 90s, representing different social groups \nsuch as manual workers, farmers, miners, housewives, students, the unemployed, retirees, \nlocal representatives and environmental activists. \nThe two data sets were analysed separately, following three main themes: (i) local demands \non the disposal sites; (ii) the influence of different actors on the decision-making process; and \n(iii) the actual impact of different actors on the development of CAD remediation solutions. \n 4 \nIn addition, the analysis explored the responses of local residents to the institutional actions \naround the CAD sites. \nThe environmental governance context of coal ash disposal and \nremediation in Tuzla \nThe significance of coal ash pollution for the people of Tuzla is related to the proximity of the \nCAD sites to their place of residence and their specific management practices. Accordingly, \ndifferent sets of expectations have emerged related to the particular characteristics of each \nCAD site. Outside the urban area, residents are organised in local communities (Mjesna \nZajednica, MZ), with elected representatives entrusted to communicate and address a wide \nrange of community concerns. For instance, the local representative of MS Solana (whose \nmembers have cultivated one of the CAD sites since the establishment of a soil cover in 1993) \npresented no reservations about the development of agriculture on the CAD sites. \nRepresentatives of MS Bukinje and MS Si\u0107ki Brod (experiencing high dust levels from \nadjacent uncovered CAD sites), on the other hand, expressed serious concerns about the \nsafety of the sites and the health risks imposed on local residents.  \nHowever, further research shows that the views of residents of different communities are \nmore homogeneous than the views of their representatives. In most interviews, safety \nconcerns about the use of the site were top of the list, even among those who cultivate the \nsites. Residents held TEP responsible for the sanitation and restoration of abandoned CAD \nsites. In the early 1990s, TEP covered Dre\u017enik and Plane with soil. Later, TEP experimented \nwith the addition of mineral wastes from nearby mines and reforestation with willows on the \nCAD site Divkovi\u0107i. However, according to local residents remediation actions are still slow \nand\/or largely ineffective.  \nLocal residents and institutional representatives offered numerous proposals about what \nshould or could be done with the disposal sites after their regeneration (e.g. building an \nindustrial zone, a sports centre or a small airport). The Municipality, pressed by the lack of \navailable land, has proposed building a cemetery, causing offence to those who consider \nburying their loved ones in a \u201edumping site\u201f a sacrilegious deed. Others are more open and \naccommodating to the range of potential land uses as long as the use entails some communal \nbenefit.  \nThe cultivation of the sites has created a conflict between those who farm the land and those \nwho consider the risks of farming unacceptable. Farming is commonly justified on grounds of \nnecessity (subsistence farming). Others pursue economic interests and press for more \nintensive farming practices on the CAD sites. For instance, the recently created Farmers\u201f \nUnion lobbies for transparent and transferable property rights, so that CAD-site farmers can \nacquire security for their production systems. Interestingly, proposals for the reforestation of \nthe sites have received little attention from institutional representatives (and the RECOAL \nteam) that have prioritised agricultural and industrial uses on the CAD sites, despite the wide \nsupport that reforestation enjoys among local residents.  \nWho has the responsibility- and the power- to take action to regenerate the CAD sites? In the \nformer Yugoslavia, municipalities and individual enterprises (such as Elektroprivreda) were \nresponsible for the day-to-day environmental regulation and management under the guidance \nof relevant ministries, together with a system of quasi-independent institutes, such as the \nUrban Planning Institute, providing advice (Clarke 2000). Thus, Tuzla municipality and TEP \nhave been given a central role in deciding the development of the CAD sites. In addition, a \nmodern urban planning institute was integrated into the new regional administrative division, \nthe Canton. \nThe result is a complex institutional structure, with loosely divided competences and a \nconsiderable administrative burden. The future of the CAD sites is briefly stated in a strategic \ndocument, the Cantonal Spatial Plan for the period 2005-2025 which was compiled by the \n 5 \nUrban Planning Institute for the Canton. The Plan, published in 2006, specifies that the CAD \nsites have to be \u201ecomprehensively remediated\u2019 to facilitate the conversion of the land into \n\u201esmall production units\u2019 (but without specifying their final use)3. The next step is for the \nmunicipality to develop \u201eimplementation documents\u201f (Regulation Plans). Overall, the \noutcome of this process is a framework for decisions, without specifying measures for actual \ndecision-making and implementation.  \nMoreover, the distribution of competencies between different levels of government and \nbetween local government institutions and industry is unclear or being challenged. Perhaps \nthe most significant example is that of the ongoing negotiations between TEP and the \nMunicipality about the property rights over the CAD sites, the value of the land and the extent \nof associated responsibilities and liabilities. Municipality officials assert that as long as TEP \nacts as the legal owner, they need to fulfil basic land regeneration duties and be consulted \nregarding any future plans for the development of the CAD sites. While in the longer term \nboth TEP and the Municipality expect the sites to fall under the town\u201fs responsibility, \nmunicipal officials are concerned about the long-term pollution problems and associated \nliabilities that the sites may pose.  \nThese negotiations are further complicated by TEP\u201fs administrative structure. Municipality \nofficials perceive that the decision-making powers in TEP are displaced to the national \nheadquarter of Elektroprivreda (in Sarajevo) and hence their local counterparts at TEP have \nno real power to negotiate with them. Moreover, Elektroprivreda in Sarajevo is pre-occupied \ndealing with the liberalisation of the energy sector and adapting to more stringent \nenvironmental and renewable technologies, as demanded by the EU. Thus, matters at the local \nlevel in Tuzla seem to be delayed by the administrative burden of a centralised institution \n(TEP) of perceived national importance.  \nThe Municipality also appears powerless to act; officials report that they lack the resources to \nremediate the sites or to enforce the implementation of environmental regulations. For \nexample a set of environmental legislation\n4\n was developed under the PHARE EU \nprogramme\n5\n, and later transposed into cantonal legislation. Local citizens particularly \nwelcomed the creation of an \u201eEnvironmental Fund\u201f6. This regulation follows the \u201epolluter \npays principle\u201f establishing a tax on those practices considered as polluting and using these \nrevenues to ameliorate impacts. A municipal employee explained that the implementation of \nthe Fund failed because of pressures from the industry on local institutions. Likewise, the \nMunicipality is unable to enforce the polluter pays principle to coerce TEP either to remediate \nthe sites or to pay for the pollution they have caused. A senior municipal official estimates the \nannual debt of TEP for air pollution alone to be around KM 2 million (about \u20ac 1 million); \ninstead, TEP appears to be negotiating the cancellation of this debt in exchange for the \nproperty rights over the CAD sites.  \nOn the other hand, the Canton and the Municipality are gaining power as a result of diverse \nalliances with local actors. The Farmers\u201f Union for instance claims that it has the support of \nthe Municipality to start cultivating the sites. On the other hand, the Canton used a local \nNGO, the Centre for Urban Ideas (Centar Urbanih Ideja) to develop the consultations for the \n                                                          \n3\n The Cantonal Spatial Plan was published in the Cantonal Official Gazette [Official Gazette, Vol 13 \n(9); Tuzla, 23 September 2006; pp.765-1035 - Sluzbene Novine, Godina 13, Broj 9; Tuzla, 23 \nSeptembar 2006; str. 765-1035].  \n4\n Environmental protection (Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03); Air protection (Official Gazette of \nF B&H, No. 33\/03); Water protection (Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03); Waste management \n(Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03); Protection of nature (Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03); \nand Establishment of an \u201eEnvironmental Fund\u201f (Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03). \n5\n PHARE is an EU Programme that provides funds to accession countries to prepare them for \nmembership of the EU. Also, integration measures and the development of harmonising regulations are \nsupported by the CARDS Project (EC Support to the BiH Government in the European Integration \nProcess). \n6\n Establishment of an \u201eEnvironmental Fund\u201f (Official Gazette of F B&H, No. 33\/03) \n 6 \nLocal Action Environmental Plan (LEAP) under the guidance and with the financial support \nof the World Bank (see CUI 2005). \nThese alliances have been particularly successful in bringing sustainability concerns into \nTEP\u201fs development plans. For instance, during 2006 TEP needed to find a location for a new \nCAD site. A previous proposal was successfully obstructed in 1998 by highly organised local \nresistance, involving groups such as the women\u201fs organisation and MZ Si\u0107ki \nBrod\u201fsenvironmental group Eco-green (Eko-zeleni). Running out of space for disposal (and \nplanning to double electricity production) TEP presented a plan to enlarge an existing CAD \nsite affecting the local community Bukinje. The Municipality\u201fs permit system required a \npublic consultation as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment\n7\n. In the end TEP \nobtained public consent (and the permit) for the enlargement, but had to agree to better \nmeasures for preventing environmental pollution and hence reducing the exposure of local \ncommunities.  \nLocal responses to coal ash pollution \nDespite some improvements in energy\/coal ash management as outlined in the previous \nsection, local residents perceive that too little is done to protect them from the risks posed by \nTEP and the CAD sites, and many feel isolated from decision-making centres. Although local \nresidents perceive that they can access the local institutions, they regard these as ineffective or \npowerless, thus not worth their engagement. Discontent is a common phenomenon in former \ntransition countries where the transition process has brought social insecurity increasing the \nnegative attitudes towards the new elected governments and institutions (Jancar-Webster \n1998). However, in BiH, this is coupled with scepticism towards a system that divides \ngovernment levels and institutions on ethnic grounds. Several interviewees stated that this \nsystem blocks the resolution of vital issues, such as environmental pollution, that have little to \ndo with ethnic divisions. Nationalist parties are seen as using environmental issues to advance \ntheir own nationalistic interests rather than tackling the actual problems. Furthermore, local \nresidents in Tuzla perceive that their environmental concerns receive little attention by the \nnational and federal governments because the nationalist parties fail to echo citizens\u201f actual \nconcerns. Thus, they feel that they unjustly bear the environmental and health burdens while \nthe rest of the country benefits from the energy production (Cast\u00e1n Broto et al 2007). \nThe interviews also indicate a lack of trust in governance institutions. For example, local \ncitizens contest measurements of environmental pollution at a monitoring station installed by \nthe Canton. Local frustration became evident after the readings led the cantonal authorities to \nsuggest that air pollution was worse in the urban centre of Tuzla than in the communities \naround TEP and the disposal sites. Local residents found several pitfalls in the measurements, \nincluding the choice of location for the measuring station (protected from CAD sites\/TEP\u201fs \npollution by a small forest) and the choice of pollutants being monitored (those more common \nin vehicles than in coal combustion emissions). Various local residents and NGO \nrepresentatives believe that the responsible authorities feel the need to protect TEP at all cost, \nand hence, because TEP pollutes beyond acceptable levels, they need to lie about pollution \nlevels.  \nInterestingly, some local residents have found activism to be a way to cope with the pollution \nrisks. Activism (in the form of environmental groups, a women\u201fs group and several \nproduction cooperatives) has brought together most people in the community of Si\u0107ki Brod, \nwho are posing a challenge to TEP by using public meetings and media to denounce what \nthey believe is an industrial threat to their lives. Some mirror their discourses in those by \n                                                          \n7\n Article 40 of the Law on Environment Protection of Canton Tuzla (Official Gazette, No. 6\/98; 15\/00) \nsets the basis for the establishment of a procedure for Environmental Impact Assessment, as defined on \na by-law (04.02.1999) \u201eon assessment of action impact on the environment\u201f. This by-law is of direct \napplication in any activities undertaken by TEP. The regulation requires a public debate on the \nassessment. \n 7 \ninternational environmental NGOs (Cast\u00e1n Broto and Carter 2008). Most interviewees, \nhowever, indicated that they were well aware of environmental problems long before the war. \nPast successful lobbying includes their organised resistance during the 1980s that led TEP to \ncover some of the sites with soil and desisting from building a new site in a locally esteemed \nlocation, the lake \u201eKop\u201f. \nIn former Yugoslavia, some interviewees felt, things were \u201edone differently\u201f. Actions to \nprevent environmental degradation were taken ad hoc, rather than within a framework (or \nSpatial Plan), but this meant that local institutions could respond more quickly to local \ndemands. Moreover, although the power of decision-making was not directly located within \nlocal communities, the governance structure was capable of incorporating and responding to \nlocal concerns about the environment. Nowadays, some residents feel that they are \ncontinuously being \u201ebothered\u2019 and \u201easked for opinion\u201f with few results emerging from their \ninvolvement. \nThe research also found very active and engaged residents willing to be involved along with \nthe industry in activities to improve environmental conditions. For instance, a representative \nof the women\u201fs group explained that if TEP was willing to develop a district heating \ninfrastructure, her local community would find the necessary labour to build the pipes and \nbring energy to every home. However, these efforts are ignored by an overly bureaucratic \ninfrastructure that is further limited by the restricted agendas of the multi-party system. There \nare signs that government institutions and civil society are joining forces to work towards a \nmore sustainable future, and industries like TEP will have to incorporate local concerns in \ntheir development programmes.  \nReferences \nBrki\u0107, H. and Bar\u010di\u0107, N.
